El dijo que no era el pero ella aunque no eligió al final ella estaba enamorada de el
JONG WOO WAS THE MVP OF THIS SEASON IDC WHAT Y'ALL SAY-
please jungwoo is such a cutie i would've definitely picked him 😭😭
to be really honest, the men i appreciate the most this season were JUNGWOO HANBIN and SEJUN , the real men
И кто жена Джин Ёна. Он уже женат?
Ah where’s sejun ? I really like how his look doesn’t match with his laidback and funny personality. His so goofy
Jong woo the greenest green forest ❤
Di episode ini semua cerita masing masing orang disorot dengan sangat baik dengan bagian bagiannya sesuai porsi,bukan tersorot intens pada satu pasangan saja,penonton yang menentukan ingin melihat pasangan yang mana adalah pilihan sendiri..bukan untuk diarahkan intens ke satu pasangan saja,saya suka episode ini..dan wajah serta apapun itu memang mengambarkan keaslian seperti merekaemang dari golongan kita yaitu masyarakat pada umumnya,beda dengan visual di musim ke 4,mereka seperti artis atau aktor yang berperan,dan pengambilan syuting untuk pasangan terkesan fokus pada satu pasangan saja.
여우는 너야~
6:41
Dex ❤
김진영 임팩트 끝판왕 "카리스마"....역쉬 UDT ....굿❤
HANBIN IS THE SUPPORTIVE FRIEND 😂
🤍🤍
Jongwoo 🥺💙
im disappointed they didnt show the scenes with soes hardships like when she was crying and uoset while talking to yoongjae, i feel like the rest of the cast would feel sympathy for her and she could finally leave it in the past knowing that everyone supports her
I like the song dex nd sk in pool please let me know anyone know the song name please
El Jin Young es un interesado y feo ! Se decidió por Nadin porque ella tiene in nivel económico bueno y quería ir EEUU tiene a alguien allí, con dinero , la otra comía de si mano por tonta
After watching the 4 seasons, for me, none of the women participants can compete with Shin Seul-ki : she's so close to perfection in every way! If only i was 20 years younger..and korean ;)
Kim JinYoung and Seulki had eyes for each other only and not any other participant in Infernos. Being a hopeless romantic myself, their attraction towards each other was magically appealing to us the audience. Fans have argued Dex was not interested in Seulki because he could not make eye contact with her whereas he did with the other girls. However I beg to differ, when you are in love ,the physical pull towards someone can be so strong that it feels almost too much to handle, causing a natural tendency to look away. Sometimes, looking away can be a subtle way of flirting or expressing interest, especially if accompanied by other body language cues. Did you all not feel the intensity of their connection when he took a gaze at her in the pool? I bet we all have been swooned by that pool scene until date. That scene alone has been the most watched in the entire franchise because of the powerful emotions between them and us the viewers. There is something altogether powerful about these two, it is such a shame that fate and chance kept pulling them into "Paradise" with people they had no feelings which was unbeknownst to both of them. Time will bring these two together again. 🥰😍🤩
Knowing how much of a sana stan dex is, that cutey sexy preference makes more sense lol 😂
As much as I love Jin Young, I’m so happy that SeulKi chose Jong Woo.. he’s such a sweetheart, his sincerity would win anyone’s heart😭❤️‍🩹 Love them all. ❤️
I wonder if they are dating after this show any news?
Seul ki is so pretty!❤
Чону ну что ты делаешь сколько пересматриваю ,все равно слезы наварачиваются ,это как в дораме
Это был лучший сезон ,взрыв эмоции которые пережели смотря за экраном ,участники все были лучшими ,Чону это отдельное спасибо за все эмоции которые переживали ,Декс конечно респект крутой парень ,Сыльки очень красивая мягкая добрая девушка,Хэнбин  яркое солнышко этого проекта,Надин просто очень яркая веселая девушка ,незнаю почему ее не выбирали по отношению к ней было не справедливо то есть эфектной красивой Соджин,и новенькая очень милая девушка,ну конечно же любовники из Титаника Соин и Енджи ,но самая любимая пара ну конечно Сои и Седжун,даже хирург был настоящим джентельменом
Where ia sejun?
Im in live with Sejun why he is not part of this 😢
元々ある英語字幕に翻訳字幕が重なって日本語字幕が見えなくて辛い😢
Best sea fr!!! Can anyone tell me the name of the song where ..dex and seulki hot pool scene?
Jinyoung and seulki..... it's been 2 year..... can't get over them...🥲
6:40 dex❤seulki
Best season i watched when Jin young comes in but it was the worst ending from all seasons of singles inferno😅
jong-woo is a reminder for all of us to not settle for less fr
Any update about them now ?,
I really feel bad for jin young😭 he really liked seul ki and  preetysure seulki liked him too it was all clear on her face....but they didn't get enough time to understand each other and seulki ended up choosing someone else🥲 it was literally a real life "love alarm ending"
Jungwooooo!!!!
I love jinjong
Where is the final part ? The last 2 episodes reaction ?
Jong-Woo is the best Green Flag man, he deserves Seul-Ki 💕
9:03
13:54 😅
Still watching in 2024
最近観ました。 シーズン２が一番好きです。 さらに私もジニョンさんが気に入ってます！ 観てて面白くて笑ったし、スルギさんと天国島デートでは観ててこっちまで感情が凄くてドキドキもしました😊 ジニョンさんは中身も外見も両方で素晴らしいですね。 女性ではソイちゃんが大好き！ 本当にしっかりしてて芯の強い子だよ。 セジュンとカップルなって良かった🎉 シーズン２何度も観てます😊 ちなみにシーズン3では名前は言わずとも常に苛つきながら観てました😅
Where's Se-Jun, I needed to see his reaction 😢
I am here for the thumbnail
I hate yoong Jae for helping Jin young and attack jong woo 💔💔💔 I was so sad seeing him teaming with the new guy against the one who spent more time with him but thankfully jong woo won ❤ lucky girl he was fighting with all his energy just to be with her
Honestly in the male last game I cheered for jinyoung but I feel bad for jongwoo and I cried at that time now I'm still crying jongwoo you did a great job❤😢
i watched this season bc of Dex
part 3???
Jinyoung & Seulki likes each other but other members keep interrupting, giving false information and inadvertently contribute in pulling them apart.   Jong Woo is obsessed with Seulki, Min Su 'oversold' her date in paradise with JY to everyone, Se Jeong inadvertently spread mis-information to Seulki, Nadine has a crush with Jin Young, Dong Woo also only likes Seulki. Jong Woo seems to get along well with Nadine, and if he is a good guy why didn't he get to know Nadine as well? Other young cast member, SoE also seems obsessed with Yong Jae, until Se Jun came along.   I think only Hanbin, the youngest but the most mature who let go and just enjoying the rest of his time there. He is the green flag, why didn't Nadine & So E try to approach Hanbin? Because both girls also obsessed with good looks and focus on Jin young & Yong Jae, rather than trying to give other boys a go.  In the meantime, Soe Eun and Young Jae can enjoy their time knowing one another, because no interruptions from other people.
jongwoo sucks though
Part 3?????
This was soo good and memorable and I liked it alott Their personalities were so different and so good and it's more fun to watch S2 then S1 🫶🏻✨🤌🏻🩷🩵🤍💎
Jinyoung and Seulki had the most chemistry of all. ❤ I think seulki just chooses Jong woo bc she's grateful for him, but I felt like she really likes JY.
Kim Se-Jun e Lee So-e, kim Ha- Bin são os meus favoritos de todas as temporadas. Jin Yeong me deixa confusa, mas movimentou a melhor  temporada. Silki gosta do Dex ( Jin Yeong), só escolheu o outro por se sentir insegura, mas não gosta dele, é nitido. Igual a Jia da primeira temporada, gosta de ser o centro.
The one thing I do appreciate about singles inferno is that even though people overlap their crushes there is no hate and everyone is friends with each other.  People say the show is too innocent and not enough touching but American dating shows are a mess and drama filled.  Example: “why’d you pick him and make out with him b*****?” “J saw him first” *catflight* This show focuses on feelings and connections and it’s deep conversations.
6:50
It would be great if the two of you had a happy ending. Dex likes Seulki but thinks too much about the future so he doesn't say it clearly, making her confused. At the end, the person who regretted the most was Dex, he expressed it through the song It's You after watching the show and knowing all the truth. Seukli expressed his whole heart and thought a lot before the decision night. Hopefully after Seukli graduates and famous Dex will be able to reconsider and be together.
Now Dex is the most popular among them. He really has that superstar charm
I loved serum and so e , frl I think they were the best couple in the whole show
형들이랑누나들한테매롱한거아니예요
저는연애인이더좋아요
쫌미안한데요
In year 1998, 1999 in my prime time, now my husband was just like Jongwoo in an English man version like caring, helpful, and no pressure he really always on my side. I love my husband, he loves his wife, its me. I must saved a nation in my past life!!!
i love So-e so much, she's so precious
Only watching for Kim jin young aka dex ❤
jinyoung ssi, are you sure you haven't dated ever? it doesn't look like it. hahaha
Seulki and jungwoo  Nadine and jin young  Period
Where's the reaction for episode 9 and 10?
I wish jinyoung and seulki
WHY MY YOUNG JAE SO QUITEEEE??? I MISS HIS VOICEEEEEEE
I loved looking at So-e's reactions to Se-jun when he first appeared and when he chose her to be his Paradise date.
Jong Woo = big loser energy
whoa 20:30 DEX said "That's when it started." and Hanbin : "Things changed." i guess the talk of him with Nadine really have different kind of "impact" to DEX. funny he remember so well the moment with Nadine, but he completely forgot about Minsu that also wants to talk to him 😅
23:54請問這是什麼書呢？
Dex is very nice. Everyone's feelings are taken into consideration during interviews and conversations. A really warm person.
After these images, Seulki may have fallen in love with her choice again. Because he saw all the sacrifices he had never seen before😅❤
What other dating show is Jinyoung in?
That jong woo guy is kinda creepy stalker type, the rest looks fine but that guy looks like someone that will follow you when youre not looking 😅
i love sejun the most ,and why is he not invited here?
Why does Jung woo cry so much? That guy is shooting a kdrama all by himself
Broooooo make part 3!!!!!!!!! We love it. Thank youuuuuuu
the best season out of three
dex真的神了
Saya masih bersemangat bahwa seul Ki akan bersama jin Yong oppa😅
This season is the most green flag season out of 3. All contestants has their own preference that could be clash one each other. But despite of the. Competitiveness, they're supporting each other ❤
That's really sweet of Jinyoung to tell Jong Woo that Seulgi looks mostly happy with Jongwoo -- the time after Jongwoo see the heart fluttering pool moment.   I love how Dex being supportive of Jongwoo and Seulgi relationship amidst being defeated.   Thought viewer knew that Dex and Seulgi drawn to each other with some special feelings.
jw should realise by now how he was more of a creep in the triangle ..regardless sk decision ..the show will remains as weight to whatever relationship of jw and sk had by the end of the show thus it wont even last ..with all that jw will probably blame sk about due to nature of his personality and act
It's been a year... Netflix doesn't have plans of uploading ep 9 and 10...
Who was the male during the mud fight cheering to Jongwoo?
친애하는 김진영님,  '인페르노'에서 당신을 지켜본 적이 있는데, 당신의 인품이 정말 존경스럽다고 말하고 싶습니다. 정말 멋진 분이신데, 방송을 통해 알게 되면서 팬이 됐어요. 당신의 신사다운 태도, 올곧은 성격, 일에 대한 헌신, 그리고 부인할 수 없는 잘생긴 외모가 당신을 돋보이게 합니다. 나는 당신의 친절에 감사하고 당신의 미소는 사랑스럽습니다. 당신에게는 전체적인 멋짐을 더해주는 카리스마 넘치는 아우라가 있습니다. 존경심을 표하고 싶었고 진심으로 정말 멋진 분이신 것 같아요. 이제 저는 팬이고 당신의 더 많은 작품을 기대하고 있습니다. I love you dex, I really appreciate you a lot! <3     Dear Kim Jin Young,  I've been watching you on the show 'Inferno,' and I must say, I truly admire your personality. You come across as incredibly cool, and as I got to know you through the show, I became a fan. Your gentlemanly demeanor, upright character, dedication to your work, and undeniable handsomeness make you stand out. I appreciate your kindness, and your smile is just adorable. There's a charismatic aura about you that adds to your overall coolness. I wanted to express my admiration and I genuinely find you to be a very cool person. Now, I'm a fan and looking forward to more of your work.
I swear! Nothing can top that pool scene of JinYoung and SeulKi! That's like a scene from a kdrama. 😍❤️
ジョンウ何なん😅
I like this show
I love when Jin young said"i was rooted for seul ki to win"😊
I would choose hanbin if i was there
I like Soo-e
Where's part 3 ???
Seoeun and yoonjae ❤
Why sejun was not here?
我還是覺得珍映跟瑟琪沒有在一起非常嘔嗚嗚嗚嗚 怎麼可以！！！！
single inferno season 2 more interesting then anyseason, i dont know but season 2 i think more fun hahahah
Hanbin, Sejun, So-e and Nadine were the only ones who were nice to others. The rest were too caught up with either courting or rejecting, and trying to get any kind of attention. I mean like it just a week or so, take it easy  and try to give yourself and others a chance to know each other. No need to be so competitive or self-centred. The guys wrestling was pretty awful if you asked me, i think Sejun exit was right rather than get all violent. I think they should ban such wrestling competition, pretty caveman don't you think.
진짜 슬기랑 덱스는 태양의후예 서대영 상사랑 윤명주 중위 보는느낌 같았음…
I think Jinyoung felt pressured that Seulki has set a standard for him and I don't blame her. The way Jinyoung just talks, carries himself and his personality any girl would fall for it and that's just how he is. He opened up and got rational about the situation and as a man, I totally respect that. They both deserve better. I bet Jinyoung was heartbroken when she didn't choose him. That will be a long lasting scar for him.
Jin Young is def a hot and cold player, but he's so noble and transparent, there's nothing to hate him for.
GUYS, what is the song at 6:40???? I really wanna know!!!
jongwoo …. didn’t care for him in the show and don’t care for him now
jin young and seuilkis pool scene was like the best thing that ever happened. it was the most romantic, hot thing this show has seen yet. no matter if they ended up together THAT SCENE even as a viewer felt like cloud 9 😭😭😭
I can wait for the part 3
❤ dex
Alguém sabe o nome da música que tocou nessa cena? Nesse EP?
😭😭😭😭😓😓😓The amount of tears I fucking cried because of Jong woo
Sedih kapalku Jinyoung seulki gak berlayar 😢
Why Jin-young and Nadine have not showed? I remember that they have more conversation than have showed.
I love the chemistry and friendship of this cast it’s so cute 😭😭
I feel sorry for that one girl.
part 3 nya mana min kok gal ada
Jong woo te amo❤
Joog woo has my heart. He is a gem. Seul ki doesn’t deserve him.
Jongwoo lying about not crying 😂 man even teared up when he was reacting to the show. Come on jongwoo its ok to cry :(
where us sejun
Idk if its just me but this look of Nadine somehow reminded me of Sana from Twice
종우 멋있다
This season was even better!
Yes jinyoung has the charismatic that can easily melted women's heart. But Jongwoo is the real man criteria that women always wanted in life. this is not a highschool match.  Do u ever think why all this goodlookings and atractive personalities end up in this singles inferno show? yes because they used to make a decision like a teenager before. if they just want to find someone's like jinyoung oh my god there's so many out there just walk-in to the club and choose which type makes u interested. But a man like jongwoo.. oh its so hard to get its 1 in a million. this is the right time and place to find someone you really want to involved in your life. For me, who's here still choosing jinyoung that means u're too young or not as matured as your age. Conclusion, Seul ki is a women with brain that made a wise decision for her better life. She didn't choose jinyoung because she knows it was just a momentsry feelings. she can even just walk away without choosing anyone of them, but she choose jongwoo because she also have good feelings for him and know they can work out the relationship togather.
I know I am late but I am really curious why Yoong jae helped Jin yeong instead of joong woo. Just curious.
See jun and seo e still together???
Dex show no mercy when it come to physical 😂
Hanbin is my fav
i kind of glad Jinyoung didnt get chosen that time. he deserve someone better.
I hate that jinyoung. What a red flag
11:39 “he looks cool even to me”  get over urself 🤦🏻‍♀️
The best season of single inferno and the best romance story of Kim Jin young and seulki they are so fit to be in relationship. 😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
If dex didnt come up on episode 3 i wouldve had dropped this show. He hardcarried the show and really made a big diffence. As nadine said, he mixed everything up! Without him this show would be a goner! Thanks to him, this season surpassed the first one. Cant even compare really!   He mightve not been chosen by seulki at the end, im still happy coz he is getting more attention from people now, and getting more shiw offers, hope he wont get anymore insecure with himself just because he doesnt have a stable job yet (which is the reason why he was conflicted to choose seulki due to knowing that he isnt stable enough to support her if they ever dated.) all the best to our dex! Stanning you forlife nowwww
I dont get the people calling jinyoung playboy when he just did what he needed to do to find who he really wanted to date in the end. He tried to meet and talk to the girls to know whom he is more attracted to and can see compatibility with. I dont get why he should just talk to one girl from start to end to prove that she really is the one he likes. This is a dating program, u literally is looking for your match. So i believe what jinyoung did isnt being a playboy but rather he considered a lot of things before choosing the right one for him.
Sejun acting like he was at home while staying in paradise (like Soe told) is sooo leo of him lol :DDDD He's the best
Lmao...look at that simp Jongwoo's face realizing she lusts for Jinyoung.
They showed nothing about Nadine whether it's with Dong Woo or Jin Young... I'm sad... I personally think that Jin Young and Seul Ki would have ended up together if they didn't miss each other all the time... and I also think that Jin Young and Nadine would have ended up together or at least would have had more impact on each other if they talked to each other earlier and didn't miss each other... Instant feelings wise Jin Young and Seul Ki is a good match... but I think personality wise Jin Young would match better with Nadine...
Love the show. ❤❤❤
덱스 는 진짜 슬기가 막판에 선택안한거 개감사해야함  전세계적으로 응원받음
I felt bad for Jon woo he's so lovely but the seulki had so much attraction to jin young my favourite scene of all time ❤I think she wanted to choose him but she was afraid she's a lucky girl
Young jae is sexy and  smart….
Can we talk about how wise seoeun was.
これ、ジニョンスルギパート見たジョンウとかジニョンガールズの心境気になるわ…😂 時間は経ってるだろうけど…結構酷じゃないの？www 自分だったらショックや…笑
No part 3…?
6 months and I'm still stuck on Jinyoung and Seulki.
다시봐도 덱스님 - 멋지십니다👍
🌻
This drama is like this but it is very boring, it could have been interesting but it is just❤
If nam joo hyuk have a brother it will be Han bin 😭😭😭😭😅
Nadine is the definition of Natural Beauty......    BEAUTY with BRAINS🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Why they didn't show Nadine more,
i miss the cast! huhu rooted for Jongwoo 'til the last episode! you truly deserved it!
Jin Young saved the show, his scene with Seulki was very beautiful, and in the hole fight he was the best!
この後が感動するのに…part2までなのが悲しい…
Where  is part 3?
25:16 yo lo amo
Acho a cena mais sedutora do reality
That information sound like squid game sound.
I am the only one who sees that there was something between Nadine and the doctor (at least when they recorded this reaction, now I don't know)???? First, Dongwoo is clearly jealous of the bank scene between Nadine and Jinyoung (that's why Jinyoung says he didn't understand english even though it's a lie and that nadine left on purpose ) 🤣🤣. Also, here Nadine says that she didn't know who to give the date to when it was seen on the show that she wanted to give it to Jinyoung and the rest of the girls support her 🤣🤣🤣 I don't know guys, here's something.
Oh gosh am so addicted to this season 2
Mi pareja favorita ❤ seul ki y shon woo
they should include the scene where Seulgi flirts Jin Young with "Can i cross your boundary ?" LOL that's also masterpiece... i really want to see their reaction, it must be chaotic
I think Seul-ki was crying because of Jin Young who was in paradise that day. Don't believe for a second that Seul ki is honest. She was just afraid to handle a man like JinYoung. Her lost.
I've seen the whole season in one day just because of Jin Young. What a charismatic person. Misterious and authentic. Good job. The main character of this show
Arabic
The contestants of fake show
OMG! That's why jin young lost the game! I knew something went wrong for him losing. But of course regardless, he had accepted his fate fairly. His discipline made him the man he is even if he didn't clearly get the game rule 👏😉
Jong-woo is a great guy and he did really well to get what he wanted and I'm sure he was embarrassed because he did cry once or twice maybe idk but honestly I think it's good that he showed his emotions because a lot of men don't and just bottle it up. Loved the whole cast tho and loved seeing jong-woo and so-e happy at the end. And I wish all the rest of the cast find what they are looking for
I was crying when seulki chose jongwoo. I can see seulki was in love with jinyoung, they're like a highschool crush. But with jongwoo, she's really comfortable
請問6分40秒的背景音樂名是？
Türkçe altyazı neden yok
22:01 In defense of Jong-woo and the wet wipes, it's a guy-girl thing that guys wouldn't instinctively know unless having been placed in that specific situation. I often turn to (and even prefer) wet wipes over tissues to wipe away tears or clear the "sleep" out of my eyes, because my concern is to clear away saline residue and not preserve eyeliner/mascara/make-up.
Como ela é  uma fofa.❤
So did they make part 3 of this for last 2 episodes?
more moments about se-jun and so-e plssss :((
Seulki’s beauty really captivating in any angles, very angelic face,amazing beauty she has , compare to her co-stars no wonder why 3 handsome mens wanted to win her heart…❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
6:41 what is song???
슬기와 종우를 응원하는 덱스 멋지다~~
I really want Jin young and suelki together 😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
Watching the fight in the pool was dreadful; I could hardly breathe myself. Jong-Woo broke my heart. He had to win no matter what; his determination was inspiring. My hat off to you, Jong-Woo! 💐
lmao Jong Woo when he said "You guys are like Beauty and the Beast" 🤣🤣🤣
This was so heartwarming to watch! Especially since there seems to be no bad blood between them! K reality shows are really on another level beautiful 😍
How could jong woo said "beauty and the beast" to jin young and seulki pool scene when it was a heart fluttering scene...was it a little harsh??....maybe a warrior and a princess it suits the two well....♥️👍
Where ep 9 and 10 reaction video?
It's really sad and immature how Jongwoo and Seulki insist on fooling themselves and each other resulting on the suffering of 3 people. I hope that now (after the show) they can think more clearly and make better decisions.
Can you add more subtitles
Jinwoo & sulki ❤❤❤❤
I like Jung woo use his soccer footworks when he fought with the two guys, he has still has it being trained as a professional soccer player. Thats nice to see.
Bruh if sejun were here it'd have been wholesome 😭
i hope there's season 3
Jin Young is mesmerizing. Are there others Korean men like that 😂 ? So us ladies can move there? Lol
So E is cute, she is an actress. I watched her in The Glory film.
My heart still bleeds that Seul-Ki and Jin-Young didn't end up together 🥺😭
Its sad that no one chose hanbin. he was taking care of everyone and they had good meals in inferno because of him. he lead, took responsibility and was a good friend to so-e and jong-woo. Sadly, that's it. he's just a friend to everyone. another proof that nice guys finish last. what matters more if the objective is to get a partner is generating attraction, whether that's through looks, body, charisma or stature in life. being the nicest, caring, most talented guy in the room doesn't count if it doesn't come in the package women find attractive. what being nice, caring and talented gets you is being friend-zoned.
@ 22:44 I can't speak for no one else but me as a gay guy. (I'm preferred) but even we get sad... and when we get sad... who do we confide in when we single?  NOT are main pick... but someone we know who head over heels for us is but yet is still in IN out top 5... for the straight men watching  SULKli feeling vulnerable in front of that man. you got to understand ...they on a TV show where they confined in a tent until they are let out... she of course (not at home and can't shut the world out when she needs space) is confided in him but that doesn't mean they can't form a connection. but that's just how I would go about things on the show, and I feel she felt...but if they still going strong im for it PERIOD
Jong won is amazing I really love how is still love her all time i cry in  the end
We need a reaction video for the last two episodes
Jinyoung And Jong Woo Both Were In Myy Eyes For The Whole Season!! Both Of Them Had A Strong Side For Suel-Ki!! She's Lucky To Have Both,  One The Loyal And Sweet Type And Other The Jealous And Popular Type.
why are they segregated into only guys and only girls??! that ruined the potential of this. so stupid and backwards.
I think it was really trashy of YoungJae to team up with JinYoung against JongWoo, they were together from day 1, he should have have his buddy 's back
jungwoo raised my standards so high idk.
What's the name of the book JongWoo gave you her?
0:41 Nadine can't hide her disdain for Min-Su, its both hilarious and sad.  She's not as sweet and innocent as she portrays herself.
Muchas emociones me dio esta temporada, una montaña rusa tal cual
Jongwoo and seulki scenes hit sooooo different omg i just love watching it ( when seulki cried in front of jongwoo and when jongwoo won for her ) O M G wonderful scenes 🥹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️❤️
So is there gonna be a part three with their final reactions? 🤔 I didn't get it. I hope there will be on more video. I really enjoyed watching this!
Han Bin looks so gorgeous 😍 damn
I'm waiting longer 4 part 3&4 when it's come..
Does anyone one knows if any of the couples are together?
O carinho que Han-bin tinha pela Seo-eun ,era fofo ,o amor deJong-woo por Seul-ki era fofo de ver,agora o carinho de So-e pelo Joung-jae era estressante de ver,ela so pensava nela ,e se diz timida ,o jovem muito educado sem querer ser grosseiro com ela , e ela sendo irritante.
Did everyone forget after the guy’s wrestling game, when jongwoo won, seulki deliberately chose not to congratulate him when they walked back?
Honestly, I was very moved by the whole path that JongWoo went through to be able to show his feelings. I was very touched by the pure love he developed for SeulKi. If it's to date someone, I'd like it to be like JongWoo. Besides being handsome, he is very careful with who he loves and has a very pure heart.
habrá parte 3
🤍
SEJUN AND SOE ❤  HANBIN ❤
What is the song that's playing at 8:32 ??
20:42 "I look like a scientist who failed an experiment" HAHAHAHAHA Jinyoungaaaa!
love how jinyoung is praising all the guys during the match he's so bro
25:30 "if sejun tried he would've lasted longer" jy is so nice for pointing this out and fr sejun just love his 3S - suit, sleep, and so-e lmao
Can someone tell me who said...this is when it started ....things changed ?? During the reaction
한빈 진짜 왜케 맘에 드냐 하지만 덱스가 제일이다
Im loving all the comments about Hanbin rn. He was my favorite
When is part 3 coming up?
Knowing Sejun, he would be fanboying over Jinyoung watching this lmao
If they added sejun in the beginning the show would've been a lot more interesting
종우 아무리 열 받아도 진영을 그냥 허리꺾일 정도로 두발을 확 째껴 버리다니 비열해 보임
Falta la 3ra parte ya la subieron??? O cuando ??
Ngl Nadine x Jin-young was my ship kinda wish there more clips of them.
Seulki's eyes look so relaxed all the time wow
What is the title of the song in the pool scene with JY and Seulki?😊 Thank you. 😇
28:23 nahh Han bin patting jong woo -
There is a kind of girl who, if they fall in love with a man, are tense and trembling, and their thoughts are confused, so they do not know what to say because of their feelings and their intense love for the person, unlike if she was talking to a person, joking, and having a dialogue with confidence and without tension, she would be like a friend of the person, and I am of this type same like seul-ki relationship with jin young and jong woo
i just wished it has more of sejun and so-e 😊😊😊
Watching this made me want to watch the whole show again, and I already watched it a couple of times xD
Fact - when jin young grapped jong woo yoong jae should have grapped his both leg and thrown him easly  but he just graped his one leg don't know why 😂😂 despite of resting in almost whole task resulting jin young  thrown  him all by himself .
Part 3.  ??? Please
I loved the couple that left at the end together. It was heartwarming to see the two heartthrobs be alone. Next time, change your attitude and focus on one. To the show's star couple, I hope they stay together. They have all the conditions to move on and be happy. They are beautiful, intelligent, honest, true. Kim... is not constant, he wanted to please all the girls, he forgot to pay attention to the one he believed he had already conquered. You shouldn't go to the pot very thirsty. All he could do was go after the medical student, who did everything to make him give up on the beautiful pianist girl.
The reactions were so great but i knew it would be more hilarious and happier if SE JUne was there.
Does anyone know the song at 8:35?
Gente, cada 3a parte ???? Cadeeeeee ???
Why are there no subtitles in German.  So many people from Germany are watching
Does anyone know the song 27:54?
We want SoE and Sean in a show/drama please......
" U guys are like beauty and the beast " AHHAHAAH
I know the show alr ended but I hope Jin Young got to know that the reason Seul Ki was crying was him, she cried because she had so much feeling for him. And I wish Seul Ki had known how much Jin Young cared about her, he even worried about not being able to support her career when they're in a relationship and he felt bad that he was making her uneasy because he kept going to Paradise with other girls (even though throughout the show he only approached her). The second thing is really valuable to me (in a relationship), but he ended up being vague when she expressed her feelings, man T T. I can see her heart shattered when he said he hadn't made decision.
I thought that JY was a player when i first saw him and cannot get why the girls were gushing over him. But as I got to see him more, i get the appeal. I like that he can correctly express himself in the deep conversation with Minse as a guy and yet protect her feelings. I think he’s not bad.
Cuando muestran la parte 3???
19:58 omg 🥹😍
me apaixonei pelo se-jun mnnnnnn
So -e sounded like minion lol
Mau lihat gimana reaksi yg lain tentang nadin dan jin young
Part tiga nya ngk ada kah 😭😭 pen lihat khemistri jin young oppa
Ter jin young jinyoung tim jin young sama nadine❤️‍🔥
parte 3?
After watching Nadine's youtube show with jin young, I am shipping them in real life now😂
My fave scene is when se-jun pick so e to paradise, they are my favorite couple💖,, but the other side,, the men's expression when we jun choose so e, look how was surprised Han bin. His face when he got surprised is really handsome looks like my fav actor Nam Joo Hyuk 💖💖💖.
Jung Woo is the best, hope he ll be happy in his life
Awesome! Hanbin is my fav 🙏🏻
Sejong didn't get enough screen time. Even in this reunion, she didn't get any screen time.
24:48 😅😅😅😅😅 Oh Jinyoung.... That did a little something to my heart, ngl😳😳
2 girls cryed for jin young
I don't feel like jongwoo and seulki are a real thing. We could all see that spark when she was looking at jinyoung. Maybe it's reasonable for seulki and jinyoung not dating but that doesn't create love out of nothing between seulki and jongwoo. I hope the best for all of them.
JY assuring DW and JW is the mark of a great guy as men have deep insecurities. SK and JY didn’t end up because they were both too popular and everyone seemed against their union. Girls were trying to feed doubts into SK’s head and boys were always being hostile to JY. They wanted Minsu and JY to happen but not SK and JY. SK and JY didn’t play mind games like the others and JY gave her the space and eventually accepted his defeat like a real man without unnecessary tears or acting pitiful for a girl he met a few days ago (cue JW and DW lol). He’s the main character of the show, the winner and the icon of SI2
Wait is this the “reunion”? We don’t get a whole cast real talk? Ugh
Part 3?
Hanbin and Soe
jin young should know now seulki like him from the beginning.. and also crying because she cannot spend time with him..
Where final part 3 it not yet release?
Haaa i just realized why i think i have seen Seoeun before, she really looks like Han Sun Hwa/Sunhwa from Secret, their face and personality feel really similar lol
I really liked sejun! He was kind and compassionate about others.his personality help soe a lot and I wish he was there from Day 1.
I just want to watch nadine here
Soe Eun could be the host for next season.. As she is giving the best reaction with consideration 👍👍
The way jin-young relieves jongwoo's feelings is really cool, JW looking at the scenes and feeling down, JY arrives and says the opposite to cheer up both JW and DW too. JY every episode surprises me more.
Han Bin is hilarious & husband material too . At the same time Jin Young is solid too . But poor him as SeulKi shadowing him , if he knw earlier the game bet by her & JongWoo , he definitely wil not fight for her . Fake af SeulKi .
Jin Young you look very different in your hair in Singles Inferno. You look great in your long, wavy hair. Keep up your hair like that.
where is sejun?
Watch Nadine's latest 2-part videos upload collab with Jinyoung in her YouTube channel. Her mother spoke highly of Jinyoung.
😍
So why yoongjae helped jin young instead of jong woo during the match? 😂
But I’m still curious about somthing did yoong-jea felt anything towards soe ever or nothing at all
Jinyoung made this season...best man
ซึงกีปั่นหัวสุดเป็นผมเลือกนาดีน
If tha last match were 1v1 no one couldn't beat kim jin young
I was so into this batch! Because of jinyoung and seul ki but she chose jong woo 😅
Me tornei muito fã de solteiros ilhados e desesperados
Create Single's Inferno 3 please
part 3 mana?
It's a crime not having Sejun here.
Ainda vai ter mais???
jongwoo is so cute
Soe and Sejun are my favourite pair!!!
plsss part 3 plssssssss
JIN YOUNG literally carried the weight of the show on his back.
Se-Jun is best boi 🙌 Nadine is best girl & by far my most favorite. JinYoung is the game-changer with main character energy. So-E is the fan-favorite side character with THE BEST romance plotline. Han Bin is best friend material. Se-Jun & So-e is THE BEST, healthiest COUPLE with a great plot twist. JinYoung & Nadine is my crackship; the couple that I wish had happened but didn't 💔
Jong Woo you deserved it at the end...good job and stay happy Jong woo
Jong Woo no mueras viendo cielo para dos
Estou anciosa para assistir a última parte,quando será que sai.
Please make a reaction video for episode 9 to 10
If you watch SinglesInferno 2 several times,you can feel Jinyoung's consideratttion,honesty,and good-will lies,so I watched it interestingly,and more than 90% of korean fans think that Singles 2 is the main charactr who saved it. What I wrote is Google Translation.
When seulki realized that jongwoo would watched her dramatic love story. Cute
Nobody questioned about why in the men’s wrestling game Yongjae wanted to beat Jongwoo???? I thought they are bros and YJ knew JW was dying to go with Seulki :)
han bin reminds me of jhope
Jinyoung was really hilarious 😅 I almost forgot that because since he came there was all tension.   PS: I love the sighs after the clip of Sejun's picking soe. Man, he was just so confident
Most comment had been posted by indoneses, Chinese，Japan, Portuguese .  It is not Famous in Korea? Netflix is not common in Korea?
The reaction of all  27:29. 👏👏👏👏👏 clapping to Jong Woo after fighting, HANBIN, JY, Dong woo  well deserved victory for your effort JW
14:43 am i the only one who noticed that he looks like taehyung here??
The boys hair after the show is freaking ugly 🤣🤣🤣
is there a part 3? i hope it has because i cant move on.
22:37. Seulki. &. Jong-woo.  Perfect  Moment . They are cute ❤️
They need to recruit Hanbin as a Host in season 3
They should have shown the honest convo between jiyoung and mihun where he showed indirectly that he had feelings for seul ki while they were having soju on their second day to paradise
What I don't understand is why season 2 cast are interviewed while season 1 cast were not. Does anyone have news on season 1 cast especially se hoon
This man Jongwoo is something straight out of a RomCom. I love how true he is to himself and how he chose 1 girl to focus on and left with her. With the wet/darker hair he looked handsome af
Hanbin and nadine on the thumbnail 💖💖💖💖
Where is Sejun? Hopefully, they would have another reunion.
Jinyoung tried his best to win as he wanted to go to Paradise with Seulki for the second time to be able to talk more❤.  Jinyoung ❤Seulki, so sad to see the last episode 😢
Lee Nadine and So-e were my faves ❤
Soe is such a nice person. When Seulki fell, she right away asked if she was okay. Aww such a sweetheart. Sejun and Seulki were wholesome.
I think the reason why Sejun doesnt have much screentime is because he doesnt really socialize..? He looks very shy.
Y la parte 3?
Jin young is a very extraordinary person lol his personality is super fun
Jong woo tried really hard in the game he looked super cool
YoongSeo💙💙💙
What was the name of the book Jong woo gave to Seul Ki?
13:52 helikopter scene 15:42 hanbin to soe 18:37 hanbin feeling when soe choose him
I don’t like the part where’s the guys fighting in that water. That look so sad 😢
Because Jong Woo obviously had eyes on Seulki only so he doesn’t know what happened around him 😂
I want to see them talk about how jin young stood next to nadine for so long when picking girls at the end -.-
17:07 you guys are like coaches HAHAHAH
NEED PART 3 of them reviewing finale episodes.
When part 3 ??
LOOKING BACK, Now I understand Jin Young and Seul Ki more after watching their clips over and over again.   Jin Young hates to be rejected. (Who likes to be rejected anyway?) (everyone hates rejection )  I saw this from him from another dating show he has been.   He really likes Seul Ki and just said that he is not sure because he is afraid to be rejected. He wanted to make sure that Seul Ki likes him first and will choose him that’s why he asked during the camp fire who she will choose.   But then he was rejected, even though Seul Ki said things like:  I’m only looking at you. I have set my eyes on you only.  Can I cross your boundaries? I'm going to wait for you. …and many more.   You see in the clip, Jin Young said: You’re such a tease Seul Ki.  You’re good at confusing people and their feelings.   He also said:  Why do you always talk a lot when you’re with Jong Woo and you’re always smiling but when you’re with me you don’t say a thing?  Turns out Seul Ki was the one playing both Jong Woo and Jin Young.  Seul Ki can have any man she wants so Jin Young is a challenge for her because he even said to Seul Ki: "I need time to get to know a person." Seul Ki is not used to that. 99% of Korean men would want Seul Ki to be theirs.  She is used to men liking her from the start and men coming after her.  So she wants to seduce Jin Young and try to get his attention.   In the end, she played Jin Young and Jong Woo. Because to be honest, she doesn't really like Jong Woo as a partner. She likes him as a friend.   So men, be careful when a woman plays on your feelings and confuses you. If there are fuckboys who love bomb, there are also women who plays with men’s feelings to get the attention they want and make themselves feel better. Be very careful not to get into their trap.  Jin Young is just a challenge for Seul Ki because she is not used to men not approaching her first hand. When she got what she wanted from Jin Young (when he told Seul Ki: “I think I like you.”   That was the time for her to dump him. She already got what she wanted. Making a cold guy like her.   Also, women are hypergamous. They wants males that are equal or of higher status than them. It's good that Jin Young got rejected here. He dodged a bullet.  Links added for clips from SI2 https://youtu.be/zO4w3T8ysNQ  https://youtube.com/shorts/IlMopvbdLyA?feature=share  https://www.tiktok.com/@goatlyf2.0/video/7189826705312206123  https://youtu.be/e7-EvntNU3k
OK, NOW I NEED THE LAST CHAPTER!
SeJun¨·.·¨:                     `·. SoE
Omg! Hanbin & Minsu's hair! Hanbin looks like JK with his hair like that! I barely recognized him. I thought he was Jinyoung at 1st 😄 then Minsu looks so much like Rose' with her new hairstyle 😱
came here again because of their IG live streams
Jinn young my best choice and Seul ki
Jin young and seul ki love hi Very much
im excited to see and hear se jun reactions if he's with the guys..!
Hanbin is definitely a walking greenflag
part 3?
Jong woo is a f*cking boring man always crying.Always begging
Soe's eyes when she saw sejun choose her tells everything ❤️
Onde vejo completo
Jin Young carried the season.
Does anyone know which poetry book Jong woo gave to seul ki to read?
My heart omg 😭 Rewatching this my heart flutters for them 😭
came here after the "other cast IG story" to see her reactions on Soe and Sejun part
Liking someone is not the only thing that keeps a relationship. But choosing a person you don't have feelings for is also pointless, because most likely there will be no romantic relationship. On the other hand if she chose the one her heart beats for, she could have a romantic relationship with him, even if the road to the destination had more bumps. That's what I believe. Also Kim Jin Young was a quite person and shy in her presence, he also thought seriously of their possible relationship in the future and the difficulties. And all these probably held him from approaching her more and making him sound so serious (making Seulki nervous and probably a little uncomfortable in their last conversation). These things would have been resolved if there was enough time because relationships need time. You cannot be sure of someone you met in just a week.
Jongwoo looked like a jealous bf, and seulki’s words after the scene were more literally “but jongwoo will also see my swimsuit scene, won’t he?” It wasn’t just how the scene was but also what she was wearing that she was worried he’d see.
So for the next 2 episodes, will they review too?
I miss Sejun and Soe! 🥺🤟
Sejun and seo short screen time but totally loved them ❤️ i hope they got any project together soon ❤️
13:58 14:00
Hubiera sido muchísimo más divertido ver las reacciones de sejun en sus escenas y las de sus compañeros 😢 nadie puede negar que todos pero TODOS AMAN A SEJUN
Wow I was skipping some parts while watching this show so I thought jongwoo went so hard in that challenge at the end because he wanted to beat Jin young and take seulki to paradise, but I completely missed the part in ep 7 where he promised seulki previously that he will win the challenge because she didn’t manage to... and it’s so much more emotional seeing why he worked so hard now :(
I so wanted to see Sejun's reaction 🥺💓💓💓💓
part 3
Please where's part 3
Park SeJeong, if I was one of the casts in single's inferno, I would choose you until the end. 😍😍😍
Don't like Min Su..Selfish,shameless and rude at the same time..Egnore the hint(rejection) and interrupted someone else conversations..She can wait her turn btw..It make her unattractive.
We need part 3 please....
i want soul-ki to be with jin-young so bad😫😫😫😫😫
i love them ssmmmmm
omg 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
Can somebody explain why Dongwoo asked if Nadine made that facial expression because of the wind? At 21:38.
I feel bad for jin-young i was rooting for him.
When Seulki was crying to the other guy. It wasnt bc of him. You could tell it was bc of jin young. She thought that he was probably into other girls and not into her as much.
You could tell Jin young and seulki like each other and there was an attraction towards eachother... Really bum she didnt choose him at the end. I feel like she choose the other guy out of pity. If jin young would of told her how he felt and that he wanted to stay at the inferno and talk her would of changed things. All the girls talking about jin young really got in her head
Hanbin, Sejun and Jongwoo were the greenest flags in this show
This is by far the best dating show I have ever seen. It was like a romantic drama with such great personalities. I can't wait for season 3 to come.😍
Love the cast most especially SOE Zand SEJUN 😍😍😍😍😍
I really wish they would’ve showed their reaction to the when the commentators were shocked when jinyoung had 4 girls around him at the campfire. I saw a clip of it on instagram and that’s how I got into the show
She was crying about Jinyoung
https://youtu.be/LXfN4AJ6SlE
When do we get the reunion of the last episodes? I need MORE!
Will there also be part 3?
I hope they do some fun thing like this again with se jun
Porque Soe tu achou que o Se Jun deixou  desejar mulher? Mulherrrrr, tu teve um homem bacana com interesse em ti. Cê é doido 😦
Se jun 😍
Please we need reaction for eps. 9-10, i hope sejun there too
全員が一人一人を尊重していて深慮深く、外見も中身も美しい人ばかりで、見てて癒されました♡
Jin Young is my favorite single actually.. he’s the reason why I watched Single’s Inferno until the end.. and So-e and Sejun is my favorite couple.. ❤❤❤❤
i wish sejun was here..😭
I enjoyed watching this show tbh
I love what Jin Young says to Jong Woo, i bet that made him feel better 🫶
Seulki and Jongwoo are prob dating for real. She worried when she knew that he would see the pool scene.
i always wonder why hanbin looks so familiar to me then i came to realize that he kinda looks like nam joo hyuk in some angles
Enjoyed this series so much! 🥰 1. Jong Woo is THE main character for me. He was pure, patient, caring and does not put pressure on seulki. He did his best without tearing anyone down, he was friendly to everyone and awkwardly cute and i was surprised by his tenacity and determination, any girl is lucky to have someone like him!😍  2. Seulki, i loved that seulki does not hide her feelings (tell dong woo off) and tho she had undeniable chemistry with jin young, jong woo broke her standard, i love it cuz it can happen in real life, girls go for someone they can trust and rely on.☺  3. 2nd Leads SeJun and So-E, I mean Sejun is gorgeous, well dressed, kind, charismatic, and FUNNY💯, and seeing him being uninterested to other girls except for Se E is such a STANDARD.🥵🙌 His presence added life to the show. He's such a unique character, whenever the situation is chaotic or depressing, he'd always make everyone laugh! Soe melt my heart with her sincerity, she is authentic, down to earth and apparently extremely talented.💞 She deserved that happy ending and even got the hottest guy in inferno. Love them both!🧡  4. Jin Young was an interesting character, the tension and excitement was what made the show even more interesting. I think he was truly conflicted in the end because he didn't had a chance to get to know everyone since he was always in paradise, but he played a big part in the show💪  5. I love how Sejeong was always there for the girls even tho she did not go to paradise, almost all the boys liked her at some point. She was spontaneous and fun, she had this vibe of "one of the boys"  i think that's why it was difficult to see her as a potential love interest, but overall she carried herself very well throughout the show💅  6. Han Bin!! He was the life of the party, very outgoing, the main thing i noticed is that he is selfless, he cooks for them while everyone was getting to know each other, he comforts and gives advise to so e when no one else does, he was warm and did not put pressure on so eun.. everybody know he was a total package 😎 but i guess too friendly to see him as a potential partner  7. Nadine, she was a straighforward no nonsense person, i loved that she was playing with the rules of the dating game. She did had courage and go for whom she was interested in, humble despite of her achievements & was definitely someone who teens could look up to🤓  8. So eun and young jae, at first i didnt think they suit each other but after paradise i knew then they were end game, everything was smooth, they are both mature, eloquent, respected & both looked really good. They give off noona & hyung vibes. They definitely added to the harmony of the group.🤗 I loved that so eun gave han bin a chance at paradise, young jae on the other hand i think he just wanted to be loyal to so eun and did not want to hurt so e, but in the end he should've been more direct. It's still good that they resolved it in the end  9. Dong woo and Minsu were the ones i least cheered for, they showed a bit of selfishness and minsu didn't play fair, jinyoung clearly stated he wanted to meet other people but minsu still chose him which i think is a bit rude. Dong woo lead nadine on then chose another girl, then he was too flustered when seulki told him off, hope it taught him to be humble.😊  Overall i really loved the show more that I thought i would and I currently rewatching it again!💙
31:14 Nadine didn't wave until she saw everyone else waving and then she quickly started to LOL
For me Seul ki looked like a second lead from a drama who always put smile on her face and make her look pretty but in reality she is not that good
Seul ki was overhyped by all the guys  Real amazing person was sejong
to be fair: jinyoung came after joong woo so he only had 5 days, then he was taken to paradise island by Min soo for 2 days so he only had 3 days with seul ki.  while joong woo is so bland that none of the girls notice him, jin young is so entangled with 4 girls that he likes him, he's been wasted a lot of time with seul ki but he's always looking for seul ki,  the battle in the waterhole he fought hard for seul ki.  time is on Joong Woo's side he can be with seul ki full time without being disturbed.  hin Young was at a time disadvantage but in the end he still said "I like you".  I really admire Jin Young.  he plays nice and charismatic.  in the talk when seul ki and jin young went to get water, when seul ki said he was the person she always thought of, jin young could say sweet things but he chose to tell the truth about his situation to  she knows, he's honest because he's serious in that relationship, he really thinks about seulki's future.  and dos is the expression of a real man, a sincere, mature person
Kapan part 3 tayang ???
22:46 我以為是ㄆㄧㄚˇ眼 結果一直都是這個眼神哈哈哈
Upload part 3 eagerly waiting for this video please
the fact that no one is mentioning how sweet, emotional and FUNNY jungwoo is is a downright sin. he’s literally written by a woman idc what y’all say xxx
Will they react to the last 2 episodes? Also, does anyone know whether this was filmed in 2021 or in 2022?
Who else will fast forward if its about seul-ki, jong woo or jin young? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋🙋   I wish they give more air time for so-e, se jun or nadine i love these casts dynamics than those three above
Where is there reaction of episode 9 and 10?
Is there a part 3?
Se o programa fosse no Brasil já estava todo mundo se pegando, beijando na boca, trocando de casais e arrisco dizer até fazendo sexo. Gosto dos coreanos, pois ficamos em suspense, são muito enigmáticos e respeitosos (os japoneses também são assim, quem assistiu casamento às cegas sabe).
La pelea muy intensa!! Dios jaaja
When is the next segment coming
Cmon all of these is only for 10days, who the f falls in love within a few days or a week? Its more like an infatuation.. Somemore the amount of time they communicate is so less.. within this timeframe one can only like a person based on whether their looks match their own type lol.. so i call these bs.. ask any of them on why they like each other they can only give u bs answer like because u r so handsome, so pretty, you look so strong, you look so quiet.. For caring wise, anyone can act they care lol, even for possessive people. You might think a suitor cares for u, but with this 10days what the hell will u know about the true colors of a person
Part 3
Guys probably can't tell but when a girl is really into a guy she can't talk more openly or in a carefree way. Hence why Suel ki was more shy and conscious about herself when with Jinyoung but more carefree and chirpy with Jong Woo.
Jon woo name book  please
I love watching this reality show, this season was so wonderful, so many emotions! I loved the end result, it was amazing!
where is Sejun huhu why was he not here 😭😭
Even the reaction video mostly  about seulki jinyoung and jong woo, not hate but we need fair to others also
They all lookalike  Seulki - wonyoung IVE Jong woo - rowoon Han bin - Nam jo hyuk Dong woo - some familiar actor
where is the part 3? please release it 😢
Seulki and JongWoo are very cute together. Really love them both
For me, Sulki is very pretty but her personality  is boring. If I were the guys I would like to choose nadine or se jeong. I find their persilonality very attractive.
"seluruh dunia akan menontonnya Eonnie" -Lee Nadine  wkkwkw super gemes 😆😍
Pdhal aq uda nonton sampai habis tp ttp sj menonton mereka menonton diri mereka sendiri disini tetap sj aq emosional , acara ini benar2 bagus❤
Jinyoung sekilas mirip JB got7 pas gaya rambut nya kaya gini 👍
Heyyyyy #Netflix don't be shy...... give us part 3 already😭😭
제2의 원빈이다. 배우로 크게 성장할 재능이니 관련분야에서 어서 대형 스타로 키워라. 그리고 안정되면 다시 슬기를 찾아라.
I just finished this season in less than 2 days. Like the commentators I also cried at the end but I didn’t think Seul-Ki deserved Jong-Woo. The girl must have saved the universe in her past life or something because to me she brought absolutely nothing to the table except an immature brain. Yeah she comes from a very good and high class family but I don’t think any of the men knew that. But a piano major? Come on. What the heck can you do with that? Without her family’s background what can you do with that? Anyways to have a man fall for you the way Jong-Woo did in less than 10 days and still be iffy about it and turn down a plastic surgeon  just takes some audacity IMO. She herself said that she sees Jong-Woo as a friend so I hope she treats him well because the way I see it that man is pure gold.  I still can’t figure out why no one went for Se-Jeong. She was very pretty and a model. I saw her as a good fit for Dong-Woo. So-e totally did not match Yoong-Jae and I read she was in “Glory” but I can’t figure out which character she played. I didn’t think she looked good with Se-Jun either but wow that man was such a sweetie. I just haven’t figured out if his character was a total lie or that was really him because he was almost too good. I think we all know why Nadine couldn’t get anyone. She was too perfect. Too beautiful. Too smart with a perfect body. Plus she still had too much to accomplish and she lived too far away and she was way too young. Ok enough said. For Dong-Woo maybe he had the same problem. The females just didn’t know how good he was because he was just too good. Otherwise idk why none of them jumped at the chance. For Se-eon was pretty and she was Ms. Korea 2021 and I’m shocked that was never discussed,\. Yoong-Jae fell for her from the start and never looked back. Min-Su came late but I was a bit embarrassed for her but I’m sure her part was totally scripted. She was flat out rejected but she wouldn’t give up. When she was rejected again by Jon-Young she runs under the covers crying. I mean seriously? This is supposed to me a grown woman that’s a CEO of her own company? IIDK some behaviors were truly shocking.
longin' for the next part 🙏🙏🙏
Where is SE-JUN????
"They were on another level"....😀😀
Seulki saying, "He endured it." about Jungwoo @26:46 is so simple yet so sincere <3
Ótima série,  amei! 👏👏👏🇧🇷💙🇰🇷👏👏👏
why didn't se-jun participate?
Hanbin looks like Nam Joo Hyuk
Why wasn't the tailor there? It would've been fun to watch his reactions to the mud pit.
Aside from finding a pair, i love how great friendship was built. Hanbin and Soe’s relationship was so heartwarming,   It felt heartwarming to find someone in that secluded island to be there for you as friend/ brother like i will give you a support during hard times. Jongwoo and Sejeong also, the way they kept on cheering each other is great.
Did they spend whole eight  hours watching the show together or just some of the clips shown here..?
덱스 머리스타일 돌려놔라아~~~
Jinyoung and Suelki is the best 😭😭
26:23 É a Nadine que tá gritando "No, No" no fundo? KKKKKKKKKKKK ninguém mencionou isso por causa da cena da luta. Eu estava assim mesmo quando assistir esse ep kkkkkkkkkkkkk
They could have shown Sejeong parts like her one to one conversion...atleast we get to know her..
I think Soe was the honest on the show...just because Sejun chose her dint make her open to him completely even till the end.. she's my favorite..
Jin Young was like see you on the outside. To Min su. Lool
Kim Se-Jun walk as the end was so gangster and cool.
Hope season 3, they introduce new people regularly, not when they a week left there. Also, a big mixture of people of old and young ages. It just dragged on, when others could not talk with anyone else after others have put their claws on them. Lol
Anyone else notice at 20:53 and other moments where Jinyoung is talking with other girls, Seulki avoids looking at the TV and avoids gaze? lol
Min su is so cute.
We want part 3
We want 9 and 10 reaction
haha! Seulki was scared of Jongwoo seeing her real-life hot chemistry w/Jinyoung!
So who’s is together now
part 3?!
The girls messed up Jin-young chances in the end. Ouch
Seul-Ki was real gamer, she kept all of them thinkin that she had feelings for them and never answered a Q clearly, and jin young was really dumb to choose her, people dont see obvious when they love someone
Thanks  for subtitles.
I wish Seulki's could have choosen JinYoung, Anyway JinYoung is the whole thing in this show
Sejong is underrated 😢 I mean look at her ❤
So-e 💯
Se-Jeong looks a lot like Suzy
For me soe was just a wholesome package. Apperence wise She is just sweet and simple not just over the top beauty, she had one sided love, she got heartbroken, she cried, she was just a nobody, yes she got a friend like hanbin who really respect her feelings, then came sejun, perfect hero in soe's life, he not only choose her but littrely healed her heart and they got together at the end. What a journey she has. Production is really cleaver to put seo's journey like a k-drama that we get so obsessed about ❤️❤️
When is part 3 coming out?
i just hope sejun would be here with soi
Jinyoung is a red flag
We all know seulki think jong woo is boring af she wants jinyoung
So e fighting
So E is the type of person who keep talking about herself even when she is not mentioned in the conversation
8:18 seulki is so relatable, every time I recall an experience with a crush
seulki and jinyoung >>>>>
jinyoung saved this season ❤️‍🔥
i think here jin young relized he loves seulki
Apart from the girl's group, Jin Young really talked a lot and so the camera man gave him a lot of shots, he is at ease in front of the camera..... I guess that is why youtubers are better with these variety shows, because they know what to give for the show.
Why do I feel like seulki fakes her expressions? She knows how to make puppies eyes only 😂
I m really happy for soe when sejun care for her no matter what..... & for jung woo made me emotional & I thank seul ki for appreciating his effort😍
The best thing about inferno is that there is no negativity among guys or girls..  Unlike some show in West or even here in India where one hate others ... This makes dis show & everyone in cast appreciated
I wish se jun was here... He is my fav from d time he chose for paradise
At 14:34 what does SoE means when she said "yet it left something to be desired"? It wasn't a good date for her?? 😆
9:04 her heart still flutters while watching the pool scene 😊
7:35 “the iconic scene”❤❤❤
Though Se Jun is my ideal type not just by looks but also character ❤️... jong woo is pure lover...if this show is real
Where is part 3!????
Whre is sejun? Wkwkw😂
Siguiente parte porfis
Love you se jeong 💖💖💖
7:59 LMAAAOAOOAO AHHAKEKAKALKAKAJAJAHAH
QUE MIREN EL 9 Y 10
Falta o último kkkkk
WHERE WAS SEJUN AND WHO IS STILL TOGETHER?
the final ep ,i am overwelmed
More than girls boys are crushing over sejun 😂 look boys expression specially jinyoung 😄
What does Soe mean when she said that “It was nice, yet it left something to be desired” in 14:33?
Seulki getting flustered nd telling jongwoo to close his eyes at the part she was in paradise w jinyoung is so cute haha😭😭
ANG SAYAAAA
We need ep 9 and 10 review with Sejun
Ini kalo di indo mungkin udah jambak²an kali ya 😂 tp disini masih setenang itu
I can't help but notice that Korean subtitles are populated over the English subtitles. Makes it difficult to completely read or see the entire sentence. It's kinda distracting and frustrating. Also, maybe use a brighter font color with a black text background for the Korean subtitles. Other than that, just enjoyed the smiles on those wonderful people.
Soe is my fav frm the start. I was so happy Sejun arrived. 💕
9:09 seulkie worried for Jong woo is so cute she care so much for him like gf material
I'm here just for watching Nadine
I love moment jinyoung ❤ sheulki
Part 3 please 🙏🏻
Next episode please
Part 3 pls
Part 3 please
Part 3
Sincere keys to win women heart.
Its single inferno day, i miss them please give me more content about them
When I tell you I cried when Jong woo won! 🤧🥲😂
Jong woo is the best🥺❤
Seulki and jongwoo really dated. The way seulki afraid jongwoo see that scene. And the way jongwoo glad see them just holding hand. Omg they are so cute.
Thank you very much for the subtitles in Spanish 😍🙌👏👏
Thanks for indo sub
I don’t think @Netflix realizes that there’s a significant portion of SI viewers that would willingly watch hours of footage where nothing seemingly significant happens or is talked about, just so we can keep this season alive.
How about reaction to last 2 episodes.. Please.
part 3
Nadine: 9:15 The whole world will watch it (the scene of Seulki & Jinyoung)   But Seulki was only concerned about the reaction of Jongwoo. ❤
QUE MIREN EL CAPITULO 9 Y 10 PARA MORIR EN PAZ
Part 3 please admin 😁thanks
Where is the Episode 9 & 10?
I wish they would react to episodes 9-10 😭
i thought jong woo for the second lead🤣 but in the end he is the ML. 🤣😁 im rooting for sk and jy sadly they didn't up together. right love at the wrong time🤣
Can we take a second to appreciate hanbin's new look
24:51 그렇지~ 이거지..😏 HE'S  SO FINE
Cadê a legenda em português ?
necesito la parte 3 aaaa que emocion! sigan asi, me encantan
Bro they skipped the can I cross your boundaries scenee
Jongwooooo  So cute ahahahah
Does any one recommend reality shows as good as this one??
Jin young ❤️
Han-Bin and Se-Jun are my favorites from the show their vibes are so refreshing and funny. They're honest and I like that about them.
all of seulki's bashers are now her lovers, ha!
Please make part 3 reaction with all casts including sejun!!! And react to many more sejun-soe clips!! I need to see my loveable sejun-soe!!
I want more...
Jong woo is such a green flag, very good and loyal man. I think he is the most respected and loved man in this season.
I try really hard to like So e, but she is such a clingy person, she couldn't give up Young Jae, making poor boy uncomfortable, although he gave her hints that he didn't like her many times. And even here she can't stop talking abt him and making everyone uncomfortable.
Amei assistir, foi top essa temporada 😃🤩
From the translation of this video, Jin Young and Seel Ki said the same interesting thing after watching their moment together they said 'it gave palpitations'. You can't hide this feeling.
Jin Young is the star of the show, we have to admit it!
Part 3 please🙏😊😄
Ofc Jinyoung has such a great impact in the show but JongWoo was the main protagonist 😭😭 it’s was a ML and SML situation
KIM HANBIN BEST BOY ♥️
HANBIN MY BOY!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
for me, sejun saved this show, especially sejun and soe relationship. before sejun came, like i stuck in ep.5. even people said jinyoung is saved the show, but for me it still boring 😭 like idk why 😭 jinyoung is soo cute, his personality is so charming. but still, it feels boring for me. and when sejun came, the show is very exciting. i like everything abt sejun. sejun and so-e!
Why sejun isn’t here
Akhirnya sub indo
JOONGWOO BEST BOY!!!! HOPE SEUN SEULKII NEVER LET THIS MAN GO CAUSE HE IS HARD TO FIND.
Are the couple still together? I hope they will reveal their current relationship status✌
Jinyoung uploaded new vlog in his channel Dex101, please watch and support him. Thanks.
26:22 is that nadine shouting "no!"? T_T jongwoo-nadine friendship is also gem T_T
Where is Sejun? 😢
มีต่อไหมคะ รอค่ะ🎉
msih kesel sma Youngjae pas gulat malah bantunin Jinyoung
I feel bad for Sejeong because she wasn't able to experience going to Paradise even just for one time. And most of her attempts to make a guy she liked look at her didn't really work well either. I hoped we could see more of her on screen.
I'm from philippines and for me the most handsome is Se Jun..
I wish Sejun would've joined the show from the beginning, he was so funny and I would've loved to see more of his personality
I watch Singles Inferno because of Seul ki and Jong woo❤
Seul ki and Jong woo forever😍❤
my favourite jinyoung
When will you upload Part 3 😭
6:40
CAN YOU IMAGINE SOE AND SEJUN IN A KDRAMA? LIKE A HOT BILLIONAIRE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A CUTE COLLEGE STUDENT! WAAAAAAHHHH
jong woo really touched me while watching single's inferno 2 because he doesn't stop loving the same person even though that person always turns away from him, I know a lot of viewers support Seulgi and Jinyoung but I'm really touched by Jong Woo's struggle, we love you jong woo <3
When is the next one???
I feel Seo-eun gives sully looks.. the moment I saw her
Its giving 2ML vibes
Ohh this is the one,army think he is jungkook of bts.
Jinyoung & seul ki were the highlight of this show
jin young is so cute
I feel like every time Soe talk, the girls are quiet and didn’t make any movements or comment. But not to the others.
The way Hanbin was slept on was criminal
Legenda em português please 🙏
Is it just me--- Seulki's eyes look so blank when she mentioned Jongwoo?
will there be part 3?
포르투갈어로 자막을 넣을 건가요?
Jin Young was the MVP of season 2.  Without him, it would have been so boring
why isn't sejun here would have been nice to see him and he's so funny
Extend more EP. Please NETFLIX.  I need to see more hidden scences there are not in the main 10 EP.
i would like if the highlights was seulki with jinyoung. jongwoo seem like posesive type of person
Yoongjae and Seoeun was the best couple from this season for me. It wasnt so dramatic and tense and controversial but their chemistry was off the charts, I also expected steamy love triangles and the likes from a tv dating show but I didnt expect to see talking for 6+ hours straight, that much trust and confidence and that stability. It was like watching two soulmates come together. I love themm.
this is the best season me thinks. like, no offense to the s1 casts they were all wonderful but it was a bit dominated by Zia (a queen). I personally looked forward most to her scenes but even the final couples and relationships didnt get me shipping this much. S2 casts' chemistry were so good both romantically and as friends, there wasn't a single scene stealer like for me they were all so interesting and I rooted for everyone. They set the bar so high.
I will never forget Jongwoo's feeling after the match when the result was revealed 🥺🫰
7:33 that was my favorite scene Everything was so smooth, even the atmosphere was filled with their chemistry
Poderia ter uma legenda em Português...
Jin young YouTube channel dex 101 he is funny in real life than in show 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love Han-Bin new haircut ✨👌🏼
I just feel when I try to compare Singles inferno to similar dating shows in India there is so much difference , there is no cussing or bad words , the guys going for the same girl still have respect for each other and never cross the line . Indian dating shows like splitsvilla can learn from this show.
Season 2 was very different than 1st one, and for now it's really the best. Immersive and emotional. I like to follow the cast with reviews and know more about their thoughts. Thank you for this video.
Everything it's good except only physical competition. I need the other competition such as in Creativity, Intelligence, or other skills.
hanbin is so underrated 🥹🫶🏻
I enjoyed this ..hope to see a part 3 for the last 2 episodes
that hair color suits Min-su so much!!! I wish she had it from the beginning of the show, she would be more attractive
💖💖💖
Let’s be real JW is the 2nd lead character in kdrama who treats the girl really well and the girl is super comfortable with him, where Jinyoung is the lead who has the bad boy look but actually good and at the end the girl goes for Jinyoung in kdrama tho.
Man, I wish Sejun was here
I didn’t see why Jin young was so popular at first but as the went by I was like ok I want him hahahha but Hanbin is such a husband material, soo kind and was nice to everyone, whoever marry him is lucky lol Also I love how honest Jinyoung and Seo was. Rooted for Seo from the beginning.
Jongwoo under dog to alpha male
so happy for jongwoooo  this season is definitely better for me
Honestly I just kept rewatching Episodes 6-10. it has become interesting due to Sejun's arrival 🤣
I love how healthy jongwoo and Jinyoung are even though they are "enemies"
I'm rooting for Jong Woo since EP1. I really like the underdog vibes. He shows vulnerability to his emotion and sincerity to his love. He's kinda a person who never leave his special someone until the endgame.. and therefore I'm happy that he ended with Seul Ki. For me they are perfect couple.
jungwoo giving his best and i'm so happy seulki choose him😭
14:10 cutee hahaha
It was a good season  “Season 2”
Lovee seujeong ❤
Sejun and soe pls
I wish it had subtitles or Turkish :( :( :(
Now we need season 3 Netflix I enjoyed both seasons 😍
Oh my that was great but why sejun isn't there
They were somehow making the restaurant run for years until Gordon came and made it closed in 10 months.
Palinggg sukaaa di bagiann pesawat 🥰😍✨
17:19 Sejun : Ommo Ommo 😂
Cobaa adaa se-jun, HUAAAA, pasti polll
Does someone’s know the title of the song at 6:45 min ? plz <3
put subtitles in spanish please 🙏
Where is the caption in Portuguese??
asking Seulki "How did you feel at that moment?" she said "it was really hard at that time, even though I tried I couldn't figure out what was on the other person's mind (Jin Young)......that's how she gave up with JY , too bad for both! IF only JY reassured her by his words and action they would definitely end up as a couple.
Jinyoung best guy
LEGENDA EM PORTUGUÊS
😂💕
Please we need subtitles in Portuguese 😭🇧🇷
to this day I don't understand anyone choosing sejong for paradise... seriously she's wonderful and beautiful 😭
Legendas em português
Han Bin for season 3 PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@14:00 jinyoung reaction to Sejun and So-e in helicopter never fail to make me laugh 🤣🤣🤣
Are Jung woo and seullki real life couple???
I hope we get a season 3! This season was really good!!
Based on Suelki's reactions to her and Jinyoung's date and her saying that she is getting butterflies seems like she still has feelings for him I really hope she doesn't break Jong Woo's heart he is too precious 😭
Queria ver as reações do Sejun junto com o pessoal!! Ele foi uma grata surpresa nessa temp, amei tudo nele!!!!! GOstei de ver as meninas em unidade, Nadine tava mais caladinha, mas todas interagiram bem
I like the pointing out of how with two men, the one woman was excited/nervous, with the other man, she was calm and comfortable. It shows who was more right for her personality, who she felt safer with. It’s interesting.
When do we get eps 3?
Pensé que habría sub en español 😢
Post the deleted scene of nadin 💘like the pool scene
I really like Jin young and seulki chemistry they should be a couple in real life I really want them to be couple
Jongwoo, i hope you always happy. I like you!! Jarang sekali menemukan cowok seperti jongwoo, kalau misal seulki ga milih jongwoo wahh sangat bodoh sekali, tapi ternyata seulki sangat pintar jadi respect
is it just me or does jong woo look so different ?
Jin young making a funny face when he sees se jun holding soe hand ahahhaha
Hi Single Inferno, I want to make a suggestion.  If there is single inferno season 3. Maybe you can try casting Korean men who live abroad because I think they must be open-minded about the beauty standards of women in Korea.  Of course, tanned women wouldn't be a problem in single inferno.  I feel sad seeing Se Jeong in single inferno 3.
Jurassic world 🦖 One of my fabbb part ngl
Un kinikilig lahat sila sa pool scene ni JY at seulki lol ahaha
Jin Young is really attractive
Sejong should be in season 3 because she didn't even get a chance to go to the paradise...and little to no screen time
I watch single inferno.because of Jin young ..Jin young handsome.very manly
สงสัยอย่างเดียว นาดีนไม่ได้ลงสระว่ายน้ำกับจินยองหรอจอนไปเกาะสวรรค์
Jongwoo and Seulki endgame is the best part of the show
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The whole show and cast this season was so amazing and captivating, I couldn’t not keep watching… so many plot twists and fun interactions, but it always stayed so wholesome.   I loved loved LOVED IT! Also so happy to see that they still communicate, because they honestly all look like they could continue to be such good friends ❤
와…!! 아니 진짜 이번 시즌은 너무 너무 너무 좋았어요!! 정말 매력적이어서 엄청 재밌게 봤어요!!!   그리구 다들은 이제 아직 까지 친한 친구 처럼 얘기를 잘 하니까 더 좋아요.. 😭 처음 부터 끝까지 감동s! ❤❤❤
I see NAM JOO HYUK😂😂 jkjk ik his name is hanbin
I want an entire episode of Sejun and So-i
Jin-young is too funny🤣
I prefer Seulki outside of Singles Inferno. Did anyone else notice her voice is less high pitched?😭
Jin young!!!
After being a fan of se-jun and so-e.. I became somewhat too observant. It's true that se-jun has interest in so-e but also in se-jeong (in my opinion, and I think se-jeong also has interest in se-jun). He's been conflicted at first whom he choose but then after he talked to every female in S.I. he chose so-e.   Has everyone notice the navy blue jacket/ suit that se-jun wore while he and soe-eun were talking at the beach and dong-woo and se-jeong were having a sun bathing? That jacket also wore by se-jeong after the game by male participants in women's lodge. During the game se-jeong kept looking at se-jun. Also in Instagram, se-jeong got a lot of like from se-jun compare to so-e. I don't wanna believe it coz I'm still hooked up at se-jun and so-e coupling. 😭
if Sejun coming from ther first i think he will be the MVP, he gives up cuz he think this battle is not worth for him, he know 2 of them want seulki and he just want to stay in the place were SoE there..
8:56 Han-bin 😭😭
7:59 LOL
Still stunned that Han-Bin wasn't popular among the women. He would have been my first and last choice. Just the way he brightens up the room and intently looks at the women while they are speaking! I would have loved to see someone showing interest in him.
ขอซับไทยหน่อยครับบ
ok. Wher is Sejun?
if they just knew how much i crying during the last game and when seulki choosed jungwoo....
My fav Nadine was barely in those images. What a waste of time
So they aren’t going to talk if they are actually seeing each other or decided to be just friends? Kind of weak to me. That’s the whole point of this show no?
Jinyoung stirred up the show, which was very much needed at that point. And Sejun brought the goofiness that was needed to brighten up the tense atmosphere  I wish Sejeong had gotten more time to shine, but it's just the luck of the draw
I actually understood JinYoung when he talked about wanting a woman who was already set in the professional world. That is consideration at it's finest. And in my opinion, I don't think he was hard to read at all. He seemed to have made it so clear that he liked Seul Ki from the start, he was even different when he was with her that with the other girls. He always only approached her, were as the other girls approached him and Seul Ki never approached him either. I think it's unfair for him to get all that back lash cause I think she should have made more effort to talk to him and directly ask him to clear up her confusion. He might have a peculiar way of expressing himself but he sure made it clear he liked her. Here was also allowed  to be interested in other girls since she left room for Joon Woo, no? She was my favorite girl but it would have been nice is she was more proactive with him. Also I didn't like that Seul Ki let all those girls get in her ears, they wanted him too so of cause they'd have things to say.
seulki and jinyoung should have been together at final
i still didnt like that minsu interrupted nadine and jinyoung on that moment
I wish Sejun was here! He's so funny
Here everyone felt in love for Jongwoo
Bikin yg ada sub Indonesia nya
Soeun really adores Nadine like a baby. Love how she call Nadine baby on the show and try to interact with her always. No wonder Yongjae fall for her.  Everyone went quiet and saying when the scene of Nadine left because Min-Su interrupted Nadine-Jin young conversation, I’m pretty sure they’all thinking the same. Min Su actually played unfair. Soe and Hanbin never did such a thing to Soeun and Jin young and the rest as well except Minsu. It was quite ugly.
Is their going to be another season i would love to be another’s season but i hate the facts how the military guy hurt Lee Nadine feelings he did her so dirty  he even look like a player 🙄🙄 im glad seulki didn’t choose him
Whose still dating who loll
Jinyoung increased the tempo of single'"s inferno.
Does anyone know the people that got their date, if they are still together?
Wow I really like Soe, she is really matured choosing Hanbin
왜 자막을 껐는지 이건 니 실수야 외국인들 조회수가 더 많을텐데 안그러면 무슨말인지 이해가안가
Jong Woo did a good job👏💕
ドンウ早い方で振られちゃってまじ可哀想だったな…
スルギ可愛すぎる ジニョンLove
From the start till the end,I was rooting for Jong woo..may b I prefer a person like him(who is considerate,calm,thoughtful,humble,eye on only 1 person) m so happy for him #Mr.sunshine always be happy😊😊
i feel so bad for sejeong’s screen time😭😭
I've seen many dating reality shows and it  ALWAYS never a good time to watch the review "for the cast" 😂 so awkward . However I really liked their friendship even the ones that were involved in 3LT
No Part 3 for the final two episodes?
For being honest this season is boring... I cant get the feeling, they're so childness and i hope next season Will be fun
I just wanted to see them together and know how's keep together 💖
Seul-gi and Jin-young definitely had chemistry... but because he wasn't direct with her and left her confused, I think she started understanding how Jong-Woo started feeling towards her since he was in the same position. So I think Seul-gi chose him maybe out of sympathy... but now given the chance she's realised what a great guy he really is! Well done Jong-Woo!!!
Please show more cast interviews!! We need a review of ep 9 and 10! 🙏🏻
I wished Se-Jun was there! I loved the development between him and So-e
muito bom eles reagindo 👏
Jongwoo is so sweet, I liked him because even if he liked seulki he didn't push over to much at the same time he showed a lot to her how much he cared about her. I think jin young could get together with seulki if he showed more  his feelings, but as an introvert person I quiet understand how is difficult to show and say u like that person and he was so busy because he had to talk with the other girls.  At the end I liked the results and I think this season showed us that this group could be really good friends
who is still dating?
pongan subtitulos en español porfaaaaaaaavor
I want to see sejun reaction why you didn't include hime
Can someone pls tell me why sejun isn't here
25:31 jinyoung said if sejun tried, he could have last longer, he acknowledge sejun's strength. jinyoung have one on one with sejun three times during the game.
Some of the girls look desperate . Still running after even if they  were rejected or is only second choice. Some of the men are players. Misleading some of the girls.
9:19 jongwoo close your eyes 😭
11:22 AHHHH SOEEEE cutiiiiie <3
Srsly sejeong is underrated just like yeawon was in s1
Are we going to get a part 3 of watching their reactions to the last two episodes?
See guys in rare occasions simps do win, but I still wouldn't recommend this method to attract a female lol
Alguém legenda por favoooooorrrrr 🥺😭😭😭
Jongwoo & Seulki my favorite couple since the beginning, so glad and relieved they spent memorable times and left together
20:32 what does it mean when JY said that’s when it started to change?
Jin Young was the MVP of this series. He added so much spice
Seul-ki and Jinyoung's scene is so 🔥🔥 I was excited when I watched it
Só queria a tradução
seul ki
Wish there was a part 3 🙄🙄
8:00 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HANBIN  I wanted to see their reaction to SeoEun and Yoongjae date
wait but whose together now?.. are the couples still couples?
I love Jong Woo he is so genuine.
I want to watch their reaction at the final episode I’m waiting
So did seulki not get with jinyoung even after the show?
Jin young and Nadine ❣️
Great supporting content, thank you for posting this!  Kim Jin-Young is the most interesting man in Korea
14:00 I died when I watched this part on Netflix LMAO
Did they forget about sejeong? 😭 She's so pretty, hot girl just like jinyoung said, and so cool!!!
Sugiro colocarem dublagem na língua Portuguesa  ..#amo #séries #filmes #gratidão #Brasil
The person who didn't give up, Jong-woo! Really admired his sincerity from the beginning 🥺
Se-jun and So-e ♥️♥️♥️
Now the question that's ALL on our mind... Why did Yoong Jae help jinyoung to get Jong woo out?
Jinyoung seulki swimming moments still gives me butterflies ❤
Yeah! Jin young was the main character of the show by playing all his games so the women ended up guessing. He was still playing his game even until the end of the show, thinking that he was gonna choose Nadine by staying with Nadine for a while!! Are you serious dude!? I knew few people like you who are a game player! Dude! You’re not even attractive, and that made you very unattractive! You deserve what you got at the end (ended up not be chosen by your so called crush!)
I'm so sad! I thought we were gonna see them react to the last two episodes
We had Yea Won and Hyun Seung in Season 1 who had over-the-top chemistry with each other that you could feel from afar, even though they only had a few minutes to talk. Now, in Season 2, we had Seulki and Jinyoung, who both have their happiest moments when they're together, undeniable chemistry that even a hater can't deny. But both couples has the same result, they are not the endgame pairs!. I'm heartbroken by the outcome, wondering why we can't just have a happy ending for these two couples. At the very least, Yea won and Hyun Seung have a video of them interacting after the show; hopefully, seulki and jinyoung will do the same. <3 hehehe
I LOVE JONG WOO he is an angel
Where is sejun? 🥺
you need to show them host expressions also i really want u to show them last episode of host when they cried after suel ki  choosed jang woo
This show is forcing too much jong woo and seulki. They should have shown them the footage of the 2nd paradise of jinyoung and min su where jinyoung rejected minsu for choosing him in the 2nd paradise session. Jinyoung literally said he had his heart on seulki that's why he had a bad mood on the 2nd paradise session with minsu. That also caused a misunderstanding between jinyoung and seulkin, bcs seulki thought jinyoung was a player
1:36 ela disse "ta bom" affff fofa demais <3
It will be another video about 9 ep & 10ep??
Traducir en español también porfavor 🙏
Poderia ter legendas para o Brasil
Sub.indo donkk🙏
okay but hanbin is husband material... the way he took care of everyone and was the mood maker for the group was so cute
Alguém para legendar em português ?
I need part 3 - reunion
ขอซับไทยเถอะค่ะ ใจจะขาดแล้ว
Would there be season 3?
I hope seulki and jongwoo stay together.
need more scence sejun & So e
Please more We want to se sejun togather
Couples reunion please (Seulki♥️Jongwoo, Seo Uen - Yongjae, & So e ♥️ Sejun). Wanna see their reaction for ep 9 & 10. 🙏
Im seeing DK of seventeen in Han-bin, personality wise. They are both ball of sunshine and has that bright aura surrounding them.
Where is Sejun?
When will there be Chinese subtitles？
SEOOO EUNNNNN MY LOVEEEEEEEEEEE UEUEUEUUEUEUUEUEUEUEUUEUUEUEUEUE
15:44 love how seo eun makes the exact same comment haha
I just realized Shin Seul Ki has a similar features of Seol In- Ah
Also , people don't realize this pit is kinda stupid. it takes 2-3 guys to carry one person out of the pit this high. It takes out more energy to attack than to defend. If you watch the replays some of them were sitting down with their entire waist down the water and not fighting fairly. JY was proactively doing the heavy lifting in the pit and even the show. He helped threw down 2 contestants then when it came to Jong Woo he should have been out first but ratings wise it would be more dramatic if the "underdog" won in the end.
How is no one talking about how massive a c*block Minsu was? She basically single handedly strategically destroyed Jinyoung and Seulki’s potential relationship
What about ep 9 and 10
Got respect for Jin Young. Some of you might not agree but the last deep conversation between him and Seul-Ki showed the gap between them. He went to the extent of asking her what kind of person she thinks of him from the inside and she simply said something like "someone her mind thinks about" or something. It was a let down to be honest since it showed how infatuated she is. JY knew this fact I think and proceeded to burst her bubble by revealing his real life circumstances and that he may not be able to take care of them after the show. He wanted her to lower down expectations cause what comes after is much more important than winning a silly game. He wasn't a player. He was honest and quite honorable to the contrary revealing his vulnerabilities before a potential partner. It takes courage to open up like that and not just put your best foot forward just to win the game.  I do hope this funny charismatic guy get more breaks in real life. He was literally the catalyst and most entertaining persona in the show - even without trying so hard. Fans should support his dex101 channel and ig. simply open their minds about the reality of tv. this would be hard to top for season 3.
I want to know are they still dating...they look so good🥰 part3 of this🙂also Se Jun in the part3☺

CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 3!!!!
Indonesia subtitle please 🙏🏻
13:19 the smile yo🥹…love them both
Se Jong , where are youuuu
Where’s Se Jun ? :( he’s not in the reaction vid
Jongwoo dan seulki semoga cepat putus😬
이 방송 재밌는데 슬기가 진영의 진심어린 사랑을 거절하니 갑자기 따분하네요 진영이가 더 나은 사람이 됐으면 좋겠고 슬기는 결국 안선택하면 거짓된 희망을 퍼트리면 안되요... 그건 위선이고 로우... 진영이 있어서 신나는 쇼인데 슬기랑 노는거같아 존경합니다 진영 정신 차리세요 🔥
Chin Young is best 🤗🤗
Part 3 please 🙏🏻
Single Inferno 2 cast is more classy and nice to watch than the first season. Love! P.S: That being said Dong Woo mentality more suitable to Season 1 hahahaha I think he will hit Jia immediately if he’s in the first LOL
I keep on repeating the scene when Jinyoung & Seulki in the pool. She seems blushing & hving a huge crush on Jinyoung. I will faint if my crush hold my hand like tht
how i wish sejun was here :<
I love seulki's reaction to her and jinyoung pool scene, "Jongwoo, close ur eyes!"😂 such a cutie, hope they are a real couple now
They always cut soe and sejun moment why?!!
I definitely like dis season 2than season 1 their friendship is truelly amazing
By appearance and first impression I would match them as following:  Seul-ki & Jong Woo (they look good together) Se Jeong & Dong Woo (hot boy, hot girl) So-e & Han Bin (the cuties) Min Su & Se Jun (cz they both in fashion) Seo-eun & Yoong Jae (they have really good chemistry) Nadine & badboy Jin Young (cz they have so much in common)  Just my two cents.. they are all so handsome and beautiful.. Hope they find their forever partner.. ❤️
must have a Part 3!!!
I’m surprised they did not play any of the So-e/Yoong Jae scenes for the group’s reaction, considering it was another lengthy storyline (especially the scene of her crying over him)
Hey you in The middle i want you Your eyes attract me, your hair, everything about you, are they blind, you are very attractive 😍 I listen to korean songs that's why i'm romantic now 😅😄
Cadê a legenda pro Brasil em ??? Português 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I was hoping theybwouldve shown the hot girl and guy scene
Nadine: you messed everything up Han bin: did you understand? Jin young: no!  🤣🤣🤣 Jin young was the best character in the show! He made that show interesting!
Ok but why Han Bin looking like Michael Jackson???? Did he get face lift after the show???🤣🤣🤣
Nice cast
ليه مافيه ترجمه؟؟
I didnt watch Season 1. And started Season 2 right off the bat lol
more yoongjae & seoeun contents pls 🥺🥺
Seul-ki and Jung Woo deserved each other.  From the beginning Seul-ki had shifty eyes and seemed really fake and Jung Woo is a lowly turd using passive aggressive lip bitting and crying to bully Seul-ki into choosing him.  In the end Seul-ki was true to her two-faced self and made a two faced decision which I am sure she is regretting.  Pretty sad to see Seul-ki and Jung Woo walking away like they are both losers.  Seul-ki = two face and Jung Woo = simp bully
how is jong woo gona cont to be with seul ki after watching this?
I want to see their reactions too on the last 2 episodes. Hopefully they will and also hoping Sejun can join them 🙏🙏🙏
Jin Young was the star of the show from the moment he got on, made it more interesting. I think he honestly would’ve won the wrestling if he didn’t tire himself out so much. He was the aggressor in all the matchups if you watch closely, in the end he just didn’t have it in the tank to edge out against JW. Hope he makes an appearance somewhere else.
Si sejun p nmn inabangan ko bat wala jn
moooooreeee
Quisiera consultar si alguien sabe donde se puede ver subtitulado al español
So no one is going to question where Se-Jun was? He was too busy sleeping in and missed the reunion?😂
Wait so did they watch the full episodes or just clips and highlights of the important parts of each episode ?
Pewds : (Enraged Viking Noises)
even i watch again after jong woo win and i still cry. 😭
Why sejun is not here he should be here
Part 3
they were like " you're so into him" bruh you guys as well HAHAHAHA
"I understood everything up until 'You mix'" HAHAHAA
What a great bunch, rally enjoyed season 2, probably more than season 1 even. The casting was great! I like that they seem honest and straightforward. The finale was amazing !
much better than s1, guys that no options and keep wanting JiA
i was quite fascinated that jongwoo and jinyoung had differing perspectives but that's refreshing because they're both humble on that part and really just want seulki to be happy
sejun and soe best couple  hanbin best guy sejeong best girl the rest boring as hell
Why sejun is not here huhuh
Soe and sejun is endgame <3
Where is my tailor guy? Is he still sleeping?
Therei s one chef he actually loved all the food of
Can we get a pt 3 tho? Want to see their reactions to the finale
Love all of them where is season season 3 can't wait
Shouldn’t this be part 2/3 👀🤣
Nadine has a very ordinary face. She only speaks good English that Koreans think its extra ordinary. The other girls seem smarter.
Yoongjae Soeun is my fav 💙
Jinyoung so hilarious 😭
I love this cast!! They have such good chemistry than season 1!! They’re so sweet to each other and are so close!! Will miss them sm
https://youtu.be/JGooEs1M26c
Sub indo plisssss
I know it’s hard dealing with acne, I have it too and one of the best things that ever happened to me was discovering ur channel🤍 these days I’ve been so depressed but ur channel and u help me feel less alone <3
Im still shook Seulki really picked Jong-woo. She really seemed so into Jinyoung as he always gave her the flutters. But he never reassured her the way Jong-woo did which is what won her over.
Jinyoung really play his role as catfish. When everything become stagnant, he arrives and make it become more fun to watch. It's better for Jaejun if he comes as starter even there's Hambin as moodmaker. I know it's hard to detect catfish personality just from interview. I wish they give that role for girls like Shin Jiyeon & Shin Seulgi rather than being starter.
jin young is so effortlessly hilarious, born comedian fr 😭
That is so awkward ahahhaa watching with everyone else esp with the people your crushes ended up with 😅
Portuguese subtitles please 🙏😭😭😭
She took the money from her sister and mommy
Cada as legendas?
Jong Woo pulled all of my heart strings!
K có vietsud nhỉ
I wish they could spend a little longer in the inferno, to also give more time to the newcomers.
Inferno? More like a damp quib.
Tradução para português?
Something changed about hanbin's face he looks different. Not the hair
when Hanbin consoled Jongwoo after he won 2nd place <3 my heartt we all need a friend and lover like him :')
I would take Se-jong to PARADISE, SLAY QUEEN <3
Where is Se Jun??
i have a question guys, is hookup culture in south korea like more on the conservative side? i'm always shocked we haven't even gotten a kiss out of anyone lmao
What about Sejong and young jae and soeun?
I loved so-e throughout the show, for some reason I always favour the one that isn't in all the limelight or in love triangles etc etc ...the saddest part for me was episode 6, she confesses, he looked like he had such a hard time saying it and so e was holding back tears 😭
I don't understand this "follow my heart" sentiment.   You're on the island for 10 days. Like, nobody was actually open to meeting the whole island except for Jin Young.  Everyone was either chasing Jin Young or Seulki it made me kinda sick.  Jong Woo was very possessive and seems like a child.
I was disappointed Se-Jeon never got to go to paradise because she is so beautiful and super nice. 😢.  I hope her modeling career  becomes even more successful and she can go to places like paradise in other countries.
the tension between suel ki and Jin Young is PALPALE 🔥🔥🔥🔥. just watching them together has me smiling and shit.  im sorry but she needs to give him a chance 😭😭😭😭 even the way she was smiling at him during the finale omg. they just had terrible timing and it sucks.  im sure Jong-woo will be waiting for her when Jin Young breaks her heart so its okay yall
It funny how Jo woon compared sel ki behavior, which mean dude she just been nice to you as for Jin young she has chemistry with him period.....
I'm so happy for Jong woo and seul ki they look great together
31:14  Nadine in her own space 😂 realizing everyone is clapping/waving
The cast, the friendships and the chemistry between the couples was definetly more fun to watch compared to last season I mean I loved everyone and was rooting for all of them- but if I had to choose favs it would be Se-jeong, Sejun, Jong-woo and Nadine♡
Ok Netflix, where is the reunion now that both episodes are out. Who is still together?????
sejun wasn't even here and everyone kept talking about him, I'm in awe
When are they watching episodes 9 and 10?? I wanna see Sejun for that reaction episode! Absolutely love everyones kindness towards each other. It's beautiful ❤️
I almost stop watching this season but jin young save the show i feel bad for him seol ki didn’t choose him.😢
Jinyoung based on a show that I saw him in: He was on a survival show called Bloody game which I saw last year. His personality had a lot more dimensions on that show. He is very masculine in the sense he was thriving with the physical games and he had a lot of authority and sway with the contestants. He was someone who always had a upper hand in the game. The girls on the show loved him ( no surprise).This is a brutal game where they have to eliminate each other for money in the end. He came so close to the end and just because he didn't perform a game well he self eliminated even though he was not going to be voted off. This was a weird decision considering the nature of the game which was survival. It just ended up showing how much pride he had in himself that he wouldn't himself continue in the game. He was someone who was proud that he had principles in a game where you needed to manipulate players.  Knowing him from this show has given me a lot of clarity with his convo with Seulki. No he was not trying to play around in that convo or have commitment issues. I can tell he wanted her to know and choose him despite his financial status. That is something clearly important to him. Someone like him who is very cautious about morals and principles would want to be clear before any kind of commitment.
Quando vai lançar a legenda em português?
It’s so funny that everyone keeps clapping for Jinyoung
I hope the don't have anymore games like that. It ruining my feelings for the show
She is leading him on until she get her coffee truck. Or he is still simping for a chance. He say they look like Beauty and the Beast and clap at the end. Just odd if a boyfriend would do that.
also unrelated but hanbin’s hair looks so good
Alguém traduz a legenda pra português pelo amor de Deus kkkkkk nao entendo nada
Hebrew subtitles pleaseI live in Israel
i wish sejun was in this video, i wanted to know his thoughts as well
From this video I feel like jongwoo and seulki are still dating hehehe
We need part 3 with saejun!
I will be honest i know being good looking is not always the answer we can find that from last episode but i started the episode from jin young entrance because out of no where this scene came to my recommendation of him getting into the show.
26:30 how did JW win that? Can someone explain?
Love that there’s still content even after the show ended. S1 didn’t have a lot of that, & the cast didnt have as much chemistry as S2 (although i know there was a controversy lol). Loving our cast, wether they’re in relationships or not, we are rooting for their friendship! ♥️
Why one guy is missing ?
I wanted to see the reaction to Jurassic Park HAHAHA
I need subtitles in Portuguese please help
Big ❤️ from 🇳🇬. Jong woo worked really hard. He made everyone watching it in my house emotional when he came 2nd in the fight and at the final moment when he was chosen. Great job, guys.. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 For you all..
Episode 9&10 please
This review would of been hilirious if Se-jun was there 😂
I enjoyed this Season more than I have enjoyed Season 1.
I hope the friendship and couple stay strong , but for me transit love and i am solo is still better than many dating show in korea seeing couple from transit love (hyungyu haeun ) still dating till now and the cast still hanging out often and i am solo already have 3 couple married after show
"Is jongwoo crying?" He always cries.
Just like the movies THE MAIN CHARACTER ARE THE LOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW BUT THE LAST MAN STANDING IS JONG WOO AND HIS A 1 WOMAN INLOVE!!!!👍
Where is se jun 😓
Honestly jinyoung is so funny without even trying 😂😂 he really creates a fun atmosphere
20:43 a scientist who failed an experiment lmaojsjsjjs he's so funny 😂😂
I just disappointed he didn’t choose him I didn’t even watch the last part of the show i loss my appetite
jinyoung saved the show...love hanbin...
Jin Young's alpha personality was a delight to watch.
Just my opinion seems suelki still has not move on from jinyoung
I saw (Lee so e) on the new drama ‘The glory’
Love all the cast!＼(^o^)／
It’s funny to see dong woo regretting all his life decisions for not being with Nadine 😁
Sth tells me the couple kept dating even after the show...cute..there friendship and interaction is really nice and whole some
The whole cast is cool and whole some.....my favorite is sejun....I like how goofy, his sense of humour ,responsible and  protective he was to soe e.....he was halarious
Bct u sk wkwk
Not gonna lie, but I wasn't able to see/understand Jinyoung's appeal when he first appeared and why the girls were gushing over him. But as the episodes went on, I realized that he's actually a pretty cool person. He's honest, believes that women can do things by themselves, not pressurising, chill. And in this video, he was really encouraging to Jongwoo & provided a good insight for Dongwoo about giving Seulki space. And he's so funny with his commentaries here.  I wished he and Nadine would get together sometime soon because they share a lot of common grounds.  P.S. Hanbin really has a strong power in lightening up the mood. Very thankful for him.
Senti muito a falta do SeJun 🥺💔
O SeJun fez muita falta, como o favorito do público não está presente nessa confraternização????😭😭😭
so are they going to review last two episodes on netflix?
Jongwoo the best boii😭🥺🥺. He totally deserved Shin Suelki and vice versa
I hate when seulki “🌝🌚” aaallll the timeeeeeee 🫠
SEJEONG EU TE AMO AMOR VC MERECE O MUNDO NAMORA COMIGO 🌹💖
I saw all the hat suelki was getting because they thought she was shady like. Omg did you see her smile or tuck her hair bwhind her ear ?!? Yeah she’s flirting it’s a dating show. Then when she chose j-woo they’re like omg she’s so cute and nice because she chose the unexpected pick. Tsk tsk.
I WAS KINDA SAD WENT JINYOUNG SELKI WASNT TOGETHER' but i understand her cause of his last words maybe tht why she chnge her mind
Iam just always replay and replay part scene lee soe and kim sejun always🥹🥹❤️
Didn’t watch the first season but this second one was really entertaining and stressing 😭. Also, so-e and sejun are trully THE BEST COUPLE, they just made me feel so happy <3
i need their reaction with the scenes of soe and sejun pleaseeeee
I need sejun to be here 😭
Soe looks absolutely stunning and glowing here so so happy for her and I wish we got more soe & sejun clips!
No offense not here to make anyone sad just my opinion and personal thoughts till the end of the episode I didn’t feel the love or like vibes from Sejun towards Soe. Somewhat I felt that they’re made up couple from Pd’s sides cuz everyone felt bad for her and they wanted to spices up the show cuz to be truly it was getting boring and annoying. They just wanted more couples cuz most of them after two people and with one confirmed official couple. Lastly the contestants who didn’t ended up with anyone hope they found their love soon and single people who is reading this too😂  Good luck everyone
MORE JINYOUNG PLEASE :)
Not everyone laughing at Sejun’s reaction @17:20 😅😅
Why didn’t swoon make a a third part where they watched 9-10
Poor sejeong she barely talk  cuz she doesn’t hv that much part in the show :(((
pagsalitain niyo naman si yongjae hahahaa
Just thinking if it was indian dating show they would be killing eachother.🤣🤣
I cant move on. I understand Seulki’s decision. But what if Jong Woo was the one who is famous and not Jin Young? While many said that Jin Young convey mix signals, I think Seuki Is. Jin Young is the same since Day 1, but he wanted to treat the other girls fairly to protect their feelings. Its Seuli who changed.  Nevertheless, Thank you to all the casts. Especially to Jin Young sshi, he made the show alive! I wish you the best and find the true purpose of life.
I wanted for him to chose Nadine 🥺
Jinyoung is so impressive and charming, I absolutely enjoyed watching him❤
Why is no one talking about the friendship of Sejong and Jong woo? They were there for each other in their lowest of times and always rooted for each other. Just like Soe and Hanbin, Sejong and Jong woo are also the best of friends!
If I was JY i would never give Seulki another shot with me again because she’s not stable with her emotions.  She picks another guy she doesn’t even like (JW) just to save herself from being hurt and also to get back at JY for things he didn’t even do.  JY is the hero of the show, Seulki is the loser of the show because she turned her back on love,  and JW is the biggest loser of the show because he is a fool chasing someone that doesn’t love him back and only uses him as a convenient safety placeholder.
Wahhh Sejun the prettiest man😍😍💗
While watching this scene, I always think bad about Jinyoung wahhhh sorry jin young while watching that part I kept saying to myself that you got attracted to her b**bs and beauty😅😅sorryyyyy
where is sejun?
im guessing none of them are actually couples?...
Se jun and jong woo are my fave ❤️
Jinyoung literally saved this season. It would’ve been a bit boring without him
Wee need more of Seo Eun and Yoong Jae clips! their chemistry is priceless and exciting to watch ㅜㅜ
Now that I'm closely looking at it, Se Jun ssi said,"Shib*al" before giving up. He's really funny!😅😂
Where is Se Jun!?
My dad might still be in contact with here
We need part 3 pleaseee !!!!!
where is sejun???
we need more content of themmmm
Jinyoung lead that conversation asking Seulki what she was looking for in a romantic partner and even though Seulki took a flirty turn to that convo he was talking about his real life worries about his instability because of money and how he wouldn't be able to take care as he is not there in life yet. He is wanted to signal his current position and mostly that's what Seulgi took as a sign of rejection (I don't blame her). I didn't see that convo as him playing any sort of game but actually have a real life convo. It takes a lot to bring that level of realness to a frivolous dating show.
man they should do this with season 1 too
seulki so cringe huhu
While watching this I realized that jongwoo is a real dedicated hero
seulki fake crying be like hahah
why is my youngjae not talking 😭😭
Se jun :(
Seulki is into JY until he said to her that he needs someone stable in career and she's still a student. So its a wake up call for her.
8:06 did i just hear someone tests their mic hahaha
why is the video so whitewashed thoughh 😭😭
oh where is SeJun???
S1 : MC vibe is Jia, S2 : MC vibe is Jin YOung 🤣🤣
Seulki so classy and pretty😍
Jin young was my favourite contestant in this season. Honest and adorable 🖤
Sejun Soe (⁠•⁠ө⁠•⁠)⁠♡
I appreciate the most Choi Seoeun She is Miss Korea 2022😮 Very humble and Very Nice person She can be !
Hopefully YoungJae and Seoun will end up as couple they look good together
I want to see Sejun and Jinyoung wrestling match on one on one. I mean, I was very surprised when he handle Jinyoung attack like a boss. He only quit because so many people are after him. He is actually stronger than he look. He is not just funny or charming, he is strong as well🥰🥰
wait...jong-woo said "beauty and the beast"🤣🤣🤣🤣. The shade 🌳
Where's sejun????? 🥲🥲
* In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   (Genesis 1:1) * And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

The soldier guy is a mature man.  The barrista guy is a boy.  The pianist student is a girl.  Insecure girls would go with mature men.  Independent women would go with lovely boys.  Who are you now?
Nooo I wanted to see the reaction to the last episode :(( But thank you for translating!
It almost felt like Suelki choose him out of pity, he was crying his eyes out and was very clingy… everyone saw the chemistry between jin young and suelki, he didn’t even ask suelki when he wanted to talk everyone knew he was looking for her, and the crying baby was in between them whereas Jin young was too honest and was unable to express his feelings enough properly …I think he was very confident that suelki will choose his as till the end she was confessing to him…
Everybody is good-looking and Nadine is just so gorgeous and glowy in this video
We want art 3 please please
Por favor! Coloque legenda em português😥
Song name ?
Sejun huhuhu
I liked season 2 more than 1 and obviously after entering of jin young and se jun... The show got more spicier and funny.
有中字嗎
On verra ce que sa va donner dans les jours avenir mais je pense que Jinyoung aimé Seulki , Seulki à des papillons dans les yeux dès qu'elle vois Jinyoung a l'ecran malgré  qu'elle l'ai pas choisi 🤞
Wish they would update us, if the couples who left together are still dating.
Ep 9 to 10 review please i hope sejun is there 😍🙏❤❤
nah but no ones talking about young jae and how much of a snake he was during the match like why did he join jinyoung to jump jong woo??
everyone be fighting in the comments but my ship sailed so e and sejun and that's what matters hehehehee 💗💗
Seuki 🔥🔥🔥
just completed two seasons...and here watchung their reactions!!
Jin young really show himself as a vlogger 😂😂 he talks alot in here while the other are so silent
I really hope some high end type magazine features all casts of single’s inferno on the monthly cover because oh goshhhhhhh…… Look at their visual, soooooo stunning!!!!!
Jongwoo's faithfulness paid off.  So glad Soe got her HE with Sejun, he was really a gem.  Still don't like Minsu for intruding into people's private time so she's my least favorite, followed by Dongwoo.
Everyone talking about sejun or Jinyoung but I’m over here loving Hanbin since the beginning.
yoongjae and seoeun is definitely still dating
Why is there no CC subtitle?
Part 3 pls
28:08  nawr <3 Hanbin calming Jongwoo down
next time paki invite si sejun 😭
The only ship that touched me was "friendship"! Soe and hanbin we sail!
soe so pretty
24:49 Jinyoung laughing at himself and saying "That's right" after watching himself fight is sooo Jinyoung and i love that charm 😂
Where’s Sejun? ☹️
20:56 You mixed everything up -Nadine Ohhh... -Jinyoung  Did you understand? -Hanbin No. -Jinyoung  LMAO 😂😂
sejeong is the cutest among the girls i swear this men are really blind maybe her match wasnt here but i likke how she keeps it calm
Idk why there are a lot of girls falling over heels for Jinyoung...like the guy is a walking  ⛳   Sejun >>>>> Jinyoung
I don't hate anyone here. I just feel satisfied and happy when Youngjae sees the romantic moment between Soe and Sejun... they've found their soul mate.
my opinion: if only jinyoung elaborated his feelings more i think seulki would've chosen him. seulki was def in love with him but i feel like she chose jungwoo bc their relationship was more certain (?) jinyoung beat around the bush too much, he should've been more straightforward. tbh i was kinda irritated by so-e i feel like she couldn't read the room (yoongjae and seo eun) she kept going for yoongjae when it was clear he wasn't into her. but after sejun showed up i feel so relieved and im glad they matched. also so-e choosing hanbin to go to paradise with was a good choice. hanbin (sunshine boy), sejun (mood lifter), jinyoung (popular guy) stood out so much this season. for the girls, nadine (her chill vibes and she's pretty humble) and seo eun (her authenticity) were my favourite.
Seul-ki's love triangle with Jong-woo and Ji-young is real life True Beauty omggg
I love how jong woo was like side character in kdrama to the main lead of the show.
20:58 😂😂
Please we need subtitles in Spanish
so funny HAHAHA it sucks that se-jun wasn't here :( this cast was a lot more mature than the 1st one fo sure
why there was no like this in season 1? :((
Wish they had asked the questions we wanted!!! Why did dongwoo team up with jinyoung to take out jungwoo!!! Instead of dw/jw vs newbie jy!!! Why did minsu choose jinyoung AGAIN when she had to know Nadine wanted to go with him!! 😩 This scratched an itch though. Loved this cast sm.
Se-jun 💕So-e
Soe is so pretty 😍
Where's the tailor guy?
Jin Young is definitely my fav! He's just so adorable and charming
This is literally a kdrama y'all😂😂 Jin Young is the main character but then when the whole series rolls out everyone leans on the Second lead Jong Woo and he got the girl!! Soe and Sejun is the 2nd couple of the series we all rooted for since they alo has their own issues and twist to add flavor to their story😂 Hanbin is the series' friends of all. Dong woo is the creepy guy who's only contribution is to add drama to the beginning. Nadine is our best girl who we rooted for but like to find love outside the series. Seoun and Young Jae are just there to add in drama and My girl Se Jeong for the visual😊😊 PERFECT RECIPE for a kdrama.
8:59 HAHAHAHA Hanbin! I guess it's trueee they prevent anything from happening HAHAHAHA
Yeeeeay… Jong Woo… Im happy for u… Even me in the far place can feel your sincerity to Seul Ki.. So many tears here. 🥹
Waiting for part 3
Oh my god, i like Jin Young so much 😁😁😁
4:18 that's truee ! Seulgi can't look at Jinyoung 😂😂
Was waiting for the iconic “JurAssiC worlll” part 😢
Pliss sub indo nya
i love their chemistry so much <3
that scene made me cry again, you really did well jongwoo. i hope seulki and jongwoo's relationship will longlast
there is nothing wrong with Seul-ki's final decision but wtf, she was clearly so into Jin Young, great show tho
jongwoo and seulki <3
shout out to sejeong. she really did well. even though she didnt get picked but still had a good time there instead of rushing to chase for someone. i love her. hope to see her more in the industry. she is gorgeous as well <333
I noticed how Jinyoung talks Sejun . I think he respects the latter regarding his looks, personality and strength..
Imagine Yong-Jae picked Seul-ki in the last round for lol, would the outcome be changed? 😅  Who would Jong-woo picked?  How would Seo-eun react?   Lol.
The gem of Single's Inferno 2, Kim Jin Young. I'm so glad to know about him from this show. Started watching because of him too. Love their friendship.
Jin young:  I rooted for Seulki.  I wanted her to win.  I wanter her to get the chance to choose and choose me.  That’s def what Seulki wanted, she was so heartbroken thinking that her guy (Jin young) was out there again with the same girl.  JY’s and SK’s night together on Paradise was so intense,  Jong woo was out of the picture yet, so I laughed when he said “That confidence.” to Jin young.
Omg why is nidalee  keep talking in English so annoying
Sejong is the best. Seo eun face too long. Seulki plastic surgery. Seo e too small.
Nadine was so much into Jin Young, too bad Jin young liked only SeulKi😓😓😓
sejeong was barely in the highlights 🤦🏻‍♀️ no screen time at all
It was so cute when seulki said "jongwoo close your eyes!" during their swim pool scene with jinyoung
I hate how they arranged the seat for girls
Where’s sejun!!!!!!! I thought he’ll come in part 2
Just hope there will be season 3 with the couples of season 2 plz
Without jinyoung Single Inferno would be so boring, but he's came and make it fun. But i hate the ending, the ending is so bad
Loooool I honestly like majority of the cast even seul ki when everybody was hating on her,Jin young and sujun were the funniest tho ! Everybody keeps sayin suel ki is trying to be like jia when tbh Jin young is the guy version of jia ! lool this man gives bad bitch energy lmfaooo and doesn't even try to be funny.I remember on one of the episode ,he was surrounded with all the girls in inferno except Seul ki even the Commenters were shook, lool he always at paradise and is always being chased, he never chases any of the girls and he's literally there for vibes its hilarious
pls i love this cast so much and i mean everyone (some people online are literally so mean when the show isn't about them but the lives of these real people so i seriously respect the cast members and i won't spread hate towards anyone) but my absolute favs were sejeong soe hanbin :) at least soe came out with sejun so im super happy for them <3
How could they not show the “Yun~Seulki” moment. It was so cute, clever and pure😭Iykyk #jonseulki
i wish Se-jung was here with them. He's my favorite out of all of them and he is so funny, I would love to hear his commentary.
the casts didn’t realise Jongwoo and Seulki connection is deeper than they thought. She is actually interested in him and she completely understood his feelings for her
This show was basically Jinyoungs show, he made everything interesting
Watched this show only because of JY ❤ unique personality and future heartthrob looks ❤❤
i wish se jun is here too.. or is he sleeping somewhere? hahahaha...
Soooo I need part 3!!! 😭
Jin woo is the ideal guy to build a life with, but Jin young is what excites a chick. He has the relatable American personality. No filter and raw. She definitely was crying over Jin young. Pretty sure she thought she captured his full attention, but lost ALL hope when he became the center of attention for the ladies. That’s why she was using Jinwoo as a rebound to comfort herself.
I was really rooting for Jong woo in the last episodes, I cried with kyuhyun and dahee when seulki chose Jongwoo over Jin Young lol
Need sub indo please
Love seulki..such a fashionista but low key ❤
It just a show so, who match who not our problem let be nice here. I like them all, I hope they stay heathy and happy life so happy 2023!
It is the background music in jungwoo scenes for me
Jong woo only want whats best for seulki❤
Hope they reacted to 9 and 10th episodes too. I'm in love with this season. This is my fav show and I can't wait for next season. Plus, Sejun was missed 💖💖💖💯
Seulki and jinyoung chemistry is over the top 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i really love this season, not only find someone romanticly, but they build a friendship with everyone on the island😊
The Best boy of this show Jin Young and Sejun❤️❤️..  The Chemistry between Jin young and Seul Ki was Amazing. 🔥
I love Jin young and Seul ki❤️❤️ I'm interested this show b'cause of them.😊
annoying minsu lol. jinyoung literally told her not to choose him and she still did. what a stubborn woman..
Jin Young really stirred up the show until the end. He  put everyone on edge since no one can tell what he was thinking. Plus after the show the cast seem to remain genuinely good friends. Singles Inferno Season 2 set a high standard for season 3.
I srsly wanna know what youngjae was thinking when he decided to help jinyoung. Jungwoo really held out against two of the strongest men in the show
I wonder if jinyoung entered from the start, he would’ve went for sejeong instead. He did say his first pick would’ve been sejeong based on entrance
where’s sejun?
Guysss why does seo eun low key reminds me of lee know from stray kids wqdoiwajdkad
I really was hoping to see the cast’s’ reactions to Jinyoung and Nadine’s “JURRRRRRASIC WORLLLLD” 😭
Jong woo simp
where is Sejun thoo
Friendships formed through this  1. Hanbin soe  2. Nadine dongwoo  3. Sejeong jungwoo
Jinyoung turns out very talk active rather than yoongjae
SUB INDO PLISSSSS😭
Subtitle Indonesia please
It feels grrat to see them gather around like this.. if only se jun joined them.. I'd like to see them shoot together again next time..
I hope they will re-watch also the last 2 eps with Se-Jun♥️♥️♥️. Pleeeaaaassseeee!!!!!!
Sejun and So-e the best!🥰😍🥰😍 More please!
Hanbin being called hyung in the show and seeing how he's so supportive here makes so much sense
Omg im cryyy uri jongwo the besttt😢❤
Sejun the only who aren't here *disappointed* not going to watch..:s
Nadine’s delayed reaction at the end. 😂 So cute!
where's Se Jun?
I was so happy that Seulki realised that infatuation pass but sincerity and care can last. I'd rather be with someone who I feel secured, peace, and cared for than someone who gives me butterflies. Well done Jongwoo!
Can we have the whole clip of them introducing their ages and jobs in front of the bonfire?
I still hate Youngjae until the end. JERK!! You don't deserve to be in the first place, you just became the first place because you're a jerk! Jungwoo was the real winner there. I don't think I need to explain the reason why. I don't care about Youngjae's appearance if he's a jerk and fake person. My least favorite and then next is Dongwoo.   I don't care if someone disagrees, everyone will be like that anyway if I told you I dislike a girl there, you will say I'm jealous. So I'm wondering what will you say if I dislike a guy now huh? Lmao
why se jun is not on the panel?
I wonder if they are still together!
Sejun reminds me of Hyun Gyu in Transit Love 2. They're some kind of knight in shining armor. 🥰
When Seulki chose Jong woo, tho I already had a hunch that she may choose Jongwoo after the scene where she suddenly cried saying she wants to go to paradise with Jongwoo, I thought wow this girl is so good at mind games. She confuses the guys feelings way too much. She played jt well, impressive.
8:37 Jong-woo be like : 아.. 그렇구나 🤣
Seoeun and joong jae real couple
28:00 why do they always play this sAAAADDDDD songgggg.... makes me get all teary for no reason....asegijas;oeig
Seul ki and Jin Yeoung needs a show by themselves. There was some unfinished business there. Clearly they are not actors so just bring them back on season 3. PLEASE!!!
el mejor elenco
Maybe I'm immature, but it's so hard for me to watch these footages with the cast's reaction xDD I don't know, I'm cringing so hard rn I had to stop at 7:18 🤣
Sejun 😭
I haven't watched the show completely but why is the video all Seulki, other members are barely shown. Watch it to see more of Nadine and she barely has couple of seconds.
Jongwoo had me crying at the scene when they were wrestling. I was rooting for him so hard and it was so intense. I didn’t even care if Seulki reciprocated feelings I just wanted him to have the opportunity to show himself. I legit bawled 😭
Wahh thanks for this! It's just cute to see Hanbin and Seoun being the MCs 😆 they're both sunshine! Seoun being a noona to jongwoo lol she either finds him adorable or worries about him. Seulki also talks a lot here, that's nice. Soe and nadine very vocal and honest. jinyoung and his witty remarks. hope to hear more from sejeong, minsu and yeongjae. also please bring Sejun on the next viewing!
I really love hanbin he’s so bright and understanding he’s so sweet too like he never complained when he didn’t get what he wanted even at the end he just stayed humble 😢🫡❤ I rate him for that…..also I really love seo-eun she’s so humble and bight too she’s just like hanbin their both so sweet and I love them both 🥹🥹🥹 I hope they become good friends 🤭
Han Bin and Soeun could host a show. They really have a way of playing off each other and are both so well spoken and cheerful.
Subtittle indo pls
I love Se-jun & So-e! This season had me on the verge of tears 😭
Seulki chemistry with the two men is really a blast 🙈🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jongwoo really stole my heart, he's the best boy
i want more interviews from them 🥺🙏
No fim das contas, achei que todos se odiariam, mas se tornaram amigos. Que programa incrível. Participantes precisos. Amei essa temporada. Já estou com saudades.  🤗
I don't know why people patronized this kind of reality TV show. Single's Inferno?  In reality no matter how good it looks and showed they are happy whatever.. but the truth is it's still bad advertising of people's lives only for a show.. in reality no one cares about anyone unless you are on TV lol.. how badly bored is this generation.
I dont like seulki for joong woo. He's too good for her.  He's just an option for seulki
The “jongwoo close your eyes” is so cutee 😂❤❤
Jinyoung getting called a player when it’s minsu and nadine are doing all the chasing not him. He’s only giving those girls a chance bc it’s the point of the whole show. If he didn’t and only focus on seulki ppl will be mad too since he didn’t give other girls a chance. So you really can’t win with these people
Seems like Seulki and Jongwoo continue to dating after the show
Part 2 of this SI2 cast review revealed how Jin young carried the show himself.  The cast even felt the same way the viewers did when watching Jin young.  And gosh!!! Jong woo saying “That confidence.” to JY, and “They look like Beauty and the Beast.” just showed his insecurities!  Jin young is an ace to the show, the producers must be delighted that they put him on the show.  Him, being funny without even trying on this video, every time he said something, the guys laughed.  And he even could unhesitatingly crack some jokes about himself.  And him again, stirring everyone up here, he was able to affect everyone’s emotion as shown on every comment on here which means he did a great job. That’s the guy!  I hope I could see him on more Netflix series, he could really make it big.
IN PORTUGUESE PLEASE
no one can deny that seulgi is definitely into jinyoung. it's in her body language. her shy smile, small movements and being awkward around him screams she likes him. like you know when you are with your crush. but with jongwoo, she's too comfortable like the feeling when you are with your close friend. in a relationship it can be both good or bad thing. it depends on the person. do you prefer the kind of relationship where it gives you butterfly in your stomach, all this jittery feeling, won't make you sleep, also comes with anxiousness, uncertainty and insecurity or do you prefer that relationship where you feel secured, safe, comfortable and confident but the sparks isn't huge. so who knows what she really wants.  and we don't know who she picked when they left inferno, did jinyoung still pursue her? did she really give jongwoo a chance? did jongwoo also continue to like her and court her? only seulki knows 🫶🏼  anyways, love this season! hopefully season 3 won't take too long to come and we witness people falling in love again.
I’m still mad that my girl Se Jeong didn’t get to go to paradise 😤
Where is part 3? And where is SeJu?
Am I the only one that thinks SeulKi chose JongWoo cause she felt sorry for him? Dude be crying every time.
Jinyoung 😍😍 and nadine u guys r the reason i watch the whole season
Se Jun was edited?
Why isnt Sejun here? :/
What can I say Lee nadine she is just so cool
I rly wish seul ki and jinyoung got to go to paradise again, I think it would have influenced Seul ki's decision in the end. They had so much chemistry! Bummer he didn't win the wrestling game, but glad jongwoo got to go to paradise.
Seulki is actually all about herself, acting like she’s the something special from the start when she said they guys always love me back, then picked JW over JY because of her own pride and didn’t follow her heart. She thinks its a game and doesn’t really care about love.
seulki nih nangis2 alay bet anjing kek mau milih suami aja njir pdhl juga lu pada kan ga tentu pacaran juga
Jinyoung was the main person which make the ep is very interesting and exciting😮😮
Jin young ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish they showed the “jUrAsIc wUrLd” with Jinyoung, it was so funny
it looks like everyone got their face done.... again.
24:49 😂😂 Is he some villain
I feel like Jinyoung was not comforting Jongwoo when he saw the clip in the swimming pool because both of them are saying the truth on how Seulki acted towards/among them. It was very clear in the show on how Seulki seems awkward when with Jinyoung but relaxed a bit when with Jongwoo. They were just describing what they saw with their own eyes without really knowing what she was thinking. In fact I think Dongwoo was the one who were being comforted by Jinyoung because he seems surprised that Seulki joined into the pool when with Jinyoung but not with him so when he said he was jealous, Jinyoung quickly said that he also didn't force her to join into the pool. Nonetheless all of them has good characteristics and unique charms. Surely i will love to see more of their interactions in the future. :D
I thought part 2 would tell us who is still dating and not. I guess they don’t want to spoil the entire season when we find out no one is. 😅😭
I'm here for sejun and soe content 😍
For me, Nadine qnd Jinyoung would form a good pair, they have a lot in common, she lives in the US and he wants to go there (so they wouldn't break a part if one was gone and the other stayed) and they have common interests, since it's not everybody that would be interested in guns and stuff, but she was just like him. But unfortunately that's not enough to make people like one another, so can't force them to be together, lol.
Not Lee min su lying girl JINYOUNG SAID HE DIDNT WANT U TO PICK HIM IN SO MANY WORDS. Stop lying. We saw your face when shit was going down. U spitefully chose Jinyoung. THE LIESSSS BAYBEEE.  This is why u gotta be wary of girls like min su... these are the type of girls that will act like they like u to ur face and be undercover trying to mess u up.
Han-bin, Jinyoung and SeJun were my favorites of the guys so honest and cute. For the girls I honestly liked everyone ❤
Pls movie for kim jin young and shin suel ki, love you both ❤
What's the point of this show if they are still single after the show?
Was hoping for tye JURRRASUC WORLD” scene reaction 😢
En español plisss
I need more screentime for sejun and soe pleaseeee🥺🥺🥺😭🥹
Jin Yong is so charming 💜 😍
Hanbin looks so much like nam joo hyuk
Soeun is just natural and bright ❤
para el pùblico latino podrìan poner subtìtulos en español?
What’s the title of the song at 4:09??? 🥲
Somehow i find so-e OA. Over reacting. Its not natural at all the way she laughs and everything.
minsu and sejeong's hair colors look great!
I don't understand why Jin Young didn't choose Nadine. She was perfect for him. They were on the. same line.
damn they left out the "Jurrasic Worrrlllddd" part.  i was waiting for it. xD
the whole part 2 was basically getting to know the love triangle between Jong-woo, Seul-ki and Jin-Young
I really dont get Young Jae during the wrestling match, I don't know what he was fighting for and helping Jinyoung ing ousting Jongwoo.. Such selfishness and a person with no sense of reasoning also with the issue on So-e! tsk tsk No one was excited with his love story with So eun😼
Is it her make-up?  I almost don't recognize Nadine.
I low key was rooting for Dong woo and Nadine
Hanbin being the HOST between the participants. WE LOVE. 🤭
i need part 3
9:19 me gusto lo que dijo Seul-ki " cierra los ojos Jong-woo "💞😭
Where is Sejun?
they shouldve asked minsu why she didn't get the hint that jinyoung didn't wanna be chosen by her a second time...
Definitely liked this season more than the 1st. Nothing against the 1st season, but it didn't have something this season had: a fun, charming & likable cast.   Season 1's cast, to me at least, never felt close or felt like they could potentially be all friends. Yeonwoo was the only person who was friends with literally everyone. The others were always too focused in their own circles and groups.   This season's cast though was really nice and charming. They all seem to get along with everyone, even if it was a love rival and didn't seem to hold any (at least obvious) hostility against one another. This video shows how certain cast members will try to play the stuff off as fun or with self assurance. It's rather beautiful how all of them are so comfortable at times with each other.   Also, this cast was just more colorful compared to last season's cast. Jungwoo and Jinyong can be goofy at times, but they are also really insightful and caring in others. SoE and Seulki may have started off the wrong pace with the fanbase, but now they are really well liked due to their maturity. Sejun and Minsu may have came late, but they made their mark in the show. I'll stop there, but my point is each one, other than poor Sejong, had a good arc to understand and connect with them. Anyways, I'll miss this cast. They were really great and I hope all of them the best. Each one is a winner in my book, no matter what others say.
I love hanbin and jongwoos friendship so much 😭
I love besties, Hanbin and Soe 🥰
S2 casts just felt different from S1 casts. It was like the atmosphere around them is much lighter compared to S1 casts. Overall, i like this season more than before.
Sejun faz falta, Sejun faz muita falta
I am really happy that Seul-ki chose Jongwoo
Meus shippes: So-e and Sejun, Seuki and Jongwoo
Jong woo was bad at making guesses because all his attention was towards Seulki. I really feel that such guys don’t really care for others outside of himself and his love interest.
This season is the best! And Jinyoung is such a great addition to the team!
Sub indo please🥺
I was rooting for Dong Woo and Nadine that's why i'm a bit disappointed that their reaction to their date at the Paradise was not included here.
I love the interaction between Seulgi and Soe! Love the girl power and chill vibes from the cast.
Yoong jae is not speaking at all
i hate that min-su kept trying to hog jinyoung for herself and kept robbing nadine spending time with him
FAV CAST🫶🏻🫶🏻
Here is the button if you sincerely liked Seulki ❣️
I know this sounds greedy.. but how about a reaction by couple? Best example.. Soe and Sejun?🙏💕
part 3 please
I love this cast! It was fun seeing their reactions <3
it was fun for me to watch too
Will we get to see them review episodes 9 and 10?
Seeing how things ensued really made me realise choi Jong woo deserved to get seulki. I had mixed feelings when she picked him but now I'm glad she did.
1:36 o tá bom da So eun 😍:-):-)🙈
Sejun, where are you? We miss you.
I FEEL BQD FOR JONG WOO swimming pool !!!!!!
im impress seulki choose JW..🎉 if she chose JY she just like typical women who still want to “try and error “thing . once u become older , what u want from man is someone who love u instead u love more thn the man itself. and this JW guys is really sincere from start and i feel safe seeing him with her. good choice seulki. and im happily married with someone like JW now. and yeah im happy .❤
I really enjoyed the show and I'm so happy for Jongwoo. He deserves all the love 😘🥰
I feel bad for sejong.... So what is her job and her age? We dont get to know bcz she never been in paradise
Soooo cute 🥰x
Pôr favor ponha legenda no português ou espanhol 🇧🇷
I need a part 3 with Se Jun, please.
I was shocked in the end when jin young got left behind. I just feel like suel ki didn’t really like jong woo like that but because of his consoling to her, she grew an attachment to him. Kinda like going to someone who you know cares for you. She sought comfort and comfortability instead of true romance with jin young. The thing was, I know jin young was just as capable of sincerity like jong woo was, but he wasn’t the hero to come to suel ki’s rescue because he got called to paradise. I think if jin young never went to paradise twice and all the stupid ladies didn’t stir up suel ki’s mind and make her doubt the strength of jin young and her connection. she would’ve went for jin young. Those girls were stirring up theory’s about jin young just to get her to feel jealous. And I think it was enough that she cried for jin young then little ole boy jong woo came to the rescue coincidentally. Everything fell in to place to go against jin young. And so in the end, jin young was defeated not just by jong woo but everything from the ladies gossip to the time ticking to the unfortunate events that pulled jin young away from suel ki. If they had like 5 more days. Suel ki would’ve went with jin young forsure. It was just the shortage of time and the gossip and the consoling by Jong woo that got Jin young to lose in the end. So…, tbh…, jin young is the true victim of fate. And jin young knows this, but accepts it because that’s how fate played out and even though he knows it wasn’t fair…, he’s still humble enough to acknowledge the results. Jin young is a man who listens to fate. Whatever happens, happens. If it is supposed to be mine, it will come back to me kinda guy. That’s why he’s so cool calm and sophisticated.
Alguém sabe se tem legendado em pt😫
The most beautiful and lovely scenes were Seulki ❤ Jinyoung, both of them showed their feelings to each other.  It was sad to watch the last episode when they did not go together at the end 😢
is it just me seing that se-eun look like ryujin from ITZY.?
@12:23 & @19:04 this girl irritates the hell out of me. Does she completely lack shame or what?. This was after he very clearly rejected her btw
Can they review eps 9 and 10 with Sejun? Huhu
Can anyone tell me that So-e and Sejun are together PLEASE??????? At the end So-e got the best 2 men. Hanbin as her best friend and Sejun as her love choice.
Omg HanBin is both attractive and funny lmao. Perfect combination.
I want to see their reactions to the final episodes
Will there be a follow up for the last two episodes eventually?
🥺c’était cool
i love all the girls
love this show!!
It's gonna be a part 3 right?🙃
i wish they could all hang out more 😭
I NEED PART 3 WITH THE FINALE PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
where the heck is sejun ? why is he not here on the review 😭😭
Jinyoung is definitely the one who added spice on the show 🔥 I like how he changed the flow of the show.
Disappointed that there's no so-e and sejun moment and sejun was absent 😭
Why isn't there part 3 😭 I want to see they react to ep 9 & 10 too
Please subtitle in Portuguese! Urgent 🙏🇧🇷
Legenda em português por favor 🙏🏻
Hubiesen colocado los subtítulos en el mismo youtube para que uno mismo pueda traducir de manera manual a su idioma.
search DX101 youtube channel and be surprised on the complete opposite personality that was shown by Jin Young :D  Thank me later bye
11:17 I can't imagine if Se Jun hadn't joined the show. He's like an angle comes to rescue Se o 😍
In all honesty, I was a bit annoyed when everyone had eyes for Jinyoung but seriously, seeing his sense of humor and witty comments make him SO alluring, he seems so interesting and fun to be around 😅
3 dudes fighting over a girl with a crooked smile (still beautiful) but then u have the beautiful se jeong all alone...make it make sense
I hope Sejeong comes back for Season 3. Give hot girl a chance. I wanted to see more of her.
jongwoo what a man 😅
Dispatch please do your job 😂
Nadine best girl❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
jungwoo sweetest boy!
Aw I loved this cast
31:14, Dong-woo... that M. Metflix.
All the participants grew and matured in this S2 hopefully they will maintain their friendship for years to come.
Seulki literally said i would rather choose someone who loves me than someone i love so basically she does love jinyoung, & i still can't get over them 😭😭💔💔
Gente cadê a legenda em português?😭😭😭
Are Sejun and So E still together ? 🥺
Coming to Jin-young and Seul-ki’s moment, the scene didn’t even started that I was already feeling awkward and scared about others’ reactions 😅😅
I would've have pick Hanbin. He's such an 😇  and so adorable. He empathetic and a good leader despite him being the youngest there(or one of the youngest)
9:18 "jong-woo, close your eyes" hahahhaah they are together?
our how nice to see the couples again ... One more question that dosen't want to shut up they are together ?
Omg that was so good but I will miss them sadge and the friendship all of them was so cute and funny , happy ❤
love their friendship, especially soe x hanbin, nadine x jongwoo, and nadine x seoeun. its so heartwarming! even i made a fanedit video of their friendship ♡
WHEN WILL THE OTHER REVIEW BE UPLOADED?!?!?!
Where can we watch their review of episode 9 and 10?
Cadê em português 😔
Best Girl Seo eun 💕
Seo eun so pretty 💕💕💕
Hanbin and SoE’s friendship was so cute and the Sejun/SoE couple was my favourite. I think SoE was my favourite girl on the show. I like how honest she is!
Nadine at the ending 😂
Soe Sejun ❤
İs Seul Ki and Jin Young send post each other photo on instagram? I read that in  comments but ı can 't find in instagram?
I wish we could also see them react to the celebrity panel’s reactions too 😂
cutiesss aaaaa!!!
Subtitles in Spanish, please🙏
8:57 😂😂😂 lol I can’t
Se Jun missing
I love how they reaction to sejun holding soe hand at the helicopter 🥺🤣
So any updates what happened to all of them after the show did they became couple in real life? I'm really curious about So-e and Se-Jun though ugh~ updates on them pls 🙏
Still not happy with Yoong taking sides with J. young over J. Woo in that fight. Also the way he misled So-e, childish.   I loved the others though 💕
Subtítulo en español
No hay mas subs 😔
That cast deserves more projects ! I loved watching them together. Seo-Eun is the definiton of beauty i suppose! xx from Turkey
Alguém traduz pra português por favor 🙏🏼😭
we Need spanish subtitles
so even in interviews you guys are still gonna make seulki abd jungwoo's sorry ass the star and spotlight? disapointing
do we know which couples stayed together after the show? i thought they'd reveal that at the end of this episode
Am I the only one who feels  that these young adults mostly in their  20's are so mature  ,well mannered  and talk so well.. This was so refreshing  to watch in a reality  dating  show.. I am so impressed with their personalities..
às vezes eu esqueço que Tá bom é gíria na Coreia e tomo um susto rs
Let's start with the fact that both boys are very different and Seoul ki liked something different in each of them - it's not like she felt love for Jinyoung and nothing for Jong-woo... In my opinion, she was more suited to JW
6:35 cutee
considering their hair styles, and from what i saw on their IG, this video was shot in december.. so there is a big chance that JONGWOO AND SEULKI ARE STILL TOGETHER
Jinyoung is the star of this season. My man had 4 women pining over him and he kept the show entertaining and interesting. Seulki was the IT girl. These 2  were too popular for their own good lol, that's why it didnt work out between them in the end. Jongwoo victory makes up for all the second-leads that never get the girls in kdramas lol. Youngjae and Seoeun are the best couple of this season. Sejun is a fan's favorite. Nadine too was well liked by the audience. To be fair, all the cast was awesome. I wish them all love and happiness.
i thought only jinyoung was a jungkook wannabe, seems like hanbin is too 🤨
han bin ftw idc
OMG. Why Park Se-Jeong cover up her legs? 🤦‍♂
Omg can't wait for next reaction vid
Kore'nin kısmetse olur'u
Wow did I'm the only one that see that jin young looks little bit like jungkook?
27:56 I want a jongwoo in my life ❣
Kudos to GREAT casting! First: the star was Jinyoung with his sensual swagger but he lacked in eye contact and it played out in a lack of trust from Sulki who kept leaning into him looking for him to look at her with his words. Second: Sulki, who had the innocence, looks, and physic to lure any guy, but lacked in maturity to realize Jong-woo  (also lacking in emotional maturity) was gaining her attention by using her empathy for his plight. Third: Jong-woo and Sulki are too much alike and that makes for a boring relationship. Opposites attract! Sulki’s attraction was mutual with Jinyoung and like his first instinct, she should have stuck with hers…Jinyoung! She should have chosen Jinyoung. Too bad, they had undeniable chemistry.
I think Jongwoo and Seulki are still dating at the time of this filming.  Both of them semi teared up at the wrestling scene.  Jung woo looks way more confident talking about Seulki.  And Seulki knows Jungwoo wasn’t pretending when he thought Hanbin was checking her out. All these subtle signals are indicating they deepened their bond outside the show   I mean why not?  We can have super sweet corn coffee branch at Seulki’s family clinic building - then hire a branch manager for Gangwon flagship store. If the rent is free and the product is good… the biz can grow!  She’s in her own bubble playing piano recitals, he’s in a bubble living without financial stress.  The two are good communicators when not shy  I hope it works out… she’s better off not with some social status guy just going for looks and  family connections
Initially thought the show is going to be a hot mess..until SeJun came and whisked SoE away - that’s when it gets interesting. I luv SoE’s formed friendship with HanBin, JongWoo, Sejeong, nadine and Seulki. I can say now that Season2 is amazing. Their friendship is a treasure.
Um sonho: legenda em português.
And is it just me or does SKs smile doesn't reach her eyes anymore? She was blooming  when the show started up until she felt heartbreak with JY🤔 almost like she's lost that innocent side of her. A woman whose experienced heartbreak - and she's moving on with What she's got
Is Korea the capital of fake people I thought LA would be but seems like they took the number one spot FOR FAKE PEOPLE
"You guys are like beauty and the beast" ☠
Seulki should’ve chosen jinyoung!!! 😭
Hanbin look good with that hairstyle
I need to see their reactions to the last two episodes neowwww
Where is sejun :'(((
I can't Han Bin is all. He was my fav from the very start🤧 positive, handsome, kind and chef!!!  It hurted me see him alone
So Seuki gets jealous that JY stood by Nadi at the end and then chooses JW after Jin Y makes up his mind and comes to her... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Right now they missing each other( seulki+ jinyoung) doing their everyday life but for sure we all know when they happen to meet up their loving chemistry will sparks once more...pray for the best of them...jinyoung u really awesome guy
I feel bad for Se-Jeong. She didn't get to go to Paradise and didn't really connect with anyone.
I wish they showed the panel talking about them 😂 esp jongwoo
will they also be reacting to the last 2 episodes?
Jong-woo is the best boy this catch
faz em português 😭
Traduz em português
Super love this Season! I felt like I was watching KDrama instead of a Reality show! Super great! Got emotional too and shed some tears! Ahhh so great! Love it!❤❤❤
Listen Netlix, these people should get a conedy sitcom  like "nonstop" or like a korean version of Friends.
I enjoyed the friendships of the cast. My most enjoyable part of both seasons has been the "hosts". All brilliant, warm-hearted, and as entertaining as the cast members.
This group has a lot of good chemistry compared to the previous season. I want to see more of them pleaase
I want to see se Jun oppa reacting to the inferno.
They didn't show the "I'll wait for you" and "Can I cross your boundary" part. Why??? That was one of the best moments in SI.
Can you provide an automatic translation so that I can change it from English to Arabic
Jong woo is the main character in this show, period
Seul ki wore bikni when she was with Jin young bt with jw she was fully covered...😂😂babe u were too hard on Jong woo
I need to know the couple is real in the end ??? & are there in relationships!  OR ALL OF THIS IS FAKE LIKE DRAMA!!!
Jinyoung made this watchable.
Single’s inferno2 is Jinyoung. He is pure ,so honest,humble and SEXY. I can’t imagine this show without Jinyoung. He is so Hot. I love his personality. ❤❤
This season is Se Jun and Jin young supremacy! One made it so funny and dreamy the other just swept women off their feet! ❣
Is there going to be part 3 for the last two episodes?
Jong-woo 🎉
"Jongwoo, close your eyes" OMG kkkkk 💜
Quiero e españollll
Where se-jun??
sejun and jinyoung were the stars of the show
this cast omg
how about ep 9 and 10? 😅
Where are parts 3/2 and 4/2?! We need it now!
종우는 무슨 미녀와 야수래 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진영은 성형 안했자나 ㅋ
Jong-woo is so cutee. Estoy felíz que hayan terminado juntos😭❤❤
I also want their review of ep 9 & 10 like this.
Im 100% sure that pool scene of seulki and jinyoung made her rethink her decisions 🤣
JINYOUNG LITERALLY SAVE THIS SHOW . The casting were so boring not until jinyoung came and later on the funny banter of Sejun. the casting director should learn from this not basing only on looks and profession but an artist who literally doesnt give a F and just be his/ her self in front of the camera
😆their reaction to the helicopter ride  scene.🤣😂, I wish Sejun was there to rematch it, wonder how he would react to it.. ( maybe he would get all fluster and shy)
Honestly, I don't know if it's just a show or real. But if it is real. Then I can just say that Seul ki did choose wrong.. It was clear that her heart did choose Jinyoung.. But she wanted choice safe..It's why she did choose another guy. Jinyoung was really an honest man. You can never fall into love just in one week or one month.. Real love needs time to know each other..  But I can say maybe she lost her true love because of not being brave.  From my experience; ( It did happen to me too)
WE WANT A PART THREEEEEEEE
반짝이고 달달한 관계는 슬기 진영이었는데  오래갈 관계가 종우 슬기일 수도 있을 것 같네 ㅎㅎ…  이 영상보니까 슬기가 말도 정말 예쁘게하고 순수하고 따뜻한 사람인 것 같네요
i wonder if Jongwoo and Seulki are together since she got worried that Jongwoo will watch the scene of her and Jinyoung in paradise 😅
I love how Suelki cares about Jongwoo’s feeling during reaction time . I smile whenever she says `Jongwoo is innocent’. I feel there is something( may be like a romantic relationship) between them.
Really missed Se jun here. He would've said the most hilarious things. Or probably dozed off in the middle. 😂😂
Are the couples formed at the end of the show still together tho?? That’s what I really wanted to know
The part where jinyoung didn't understand what nadine said in english was so funny 😂😂
Actually, I can see Jin Young focused on only Seul-ki even though he was popular and talked to many women, but i knew his heart felt for Seul-ki from the start. Seul-ki started to feel uncomfortable after the girl told her that he felt good at Paradise with Min-su. Jong-woo started to comfort her and take more time with her and prove his love as much as he could. Actually, I think Jin-young was just polite and gentle to women only. I wish Seul-ki will watch the part of video when Jin-Young went to Paradise at the  second time with Min-su, he told her that he used to tell her to talk to another men as well but she still only focused on him,and you're all will knew the man heart,right? when he talks like that to you. I think Min-su is losing her charming from Jin-young heart. I think men won't like that. If he said that,just keep him space or time. If not, you will lose your charm. Even you try braver but still you can't won't his heart. I think men won't like fast confession from a girl. And of course, he was honest to show that he's not interested in you or when he is interested in another woman already.  Well,if Seul-ki saw that part,she would know she got confused with Jin-young & Min-su. He got only Seul-ki in his heart. Even Jin-young said he's curious about Nadine, but seeing him and her in Paradise together, I think only Seul-ki is the only person who win his heart. Jin-young, after so popular and busy to go to Paradise with other girls, he has not much time to talk to Seul-ki, and as he saw her with Jong-woo much after coming back from Paradise, then he felt she must like Jong-woo not him. I think they both felt upset with each other from confusion and jealousy that made them feel a part or far away from each other.  I think it's the lesson we should learn from love,only communication, make your love still alive, without communication of everything come up in your mind(your jealousy, your guessing or wrong thought of your partner ect.),will ruin your relationship and if 3rd person show up,you will lose your love one.  In the final part, Seul-ki said she almost chose someone she likes or loves in her life, but this time, she chose someone who likes or loves her.  Actually, it's different. If you choose someone you love and he/she doesn't love you back, it's wrong or it doesn't work, but choosing someone you love and he/she loves you back, it's true love. Love can't give to the person you only pity him/her. However, I hope them happy with their choices ❤️
Literally can’t get over how amazing the season was
this could be more hilarious if se jun was there to react HAHAHAHA
This was amazing 👏 👏👏👏👏👏
Should've done season 1 group also😭😭😭
Sejun is sleeping sshhhh
I need to know what book jong-woo gave seul-ki. if anyone knows please comment under this
Generally i dont watch dating shows. this was my first one n jin young is the main reason i watched it and i think without him this show wouldnt be where it is now hats off to him
please make them reunite again and watcht the last episodes and make men and women talk to each other
9:40 Jinyoung is such a class act
This was such a nice watch after watching the last episodes. I'm being greedy but id like to see them again like this TT
My boy jongwoo was hurting hahahaha😂
I need a part 3🤧
17:20 sejun haha
Can someone explain Jin Young's hairstyle?
We need part 3😢
The amt of people looking down on jongwoo n jinyoung just because seulki is rich af.... REMEMBER THE PERSON WHO IS RICH IS HER DAD NOT SEULKI SO DONT ACT LIKE ALL THE WEALTH WAS EARN BY HER AT THE END OF THE DAY IS STILL DADDY MONEY
제가 저음 부터 1회 끝 까지 정우씨에게 응원했어요. 정우와 슬기랑 드디오 같이 있었서 정말 다행이고 행복했어요. 고생 많았고 잘 하셨어요 정우씨🥰 슬기도요
PORQUE SOLO SUB EN INGLES SI EN LATAM, SALIO CON DOBLAJE HEHEHHEHEH :)
Everyone here just can't receive that seulki choose Joong woo, don't u see that SK just liked JW's posts ,would u say it was scripted by the show.  Meanwhile if it was jinyoung everyone would said they're dating in rl, so funny.
Hanbin looks so hot here and i‘m still so bitter and mad that sejun isnt here 😭😭😭😭
their new hairstyles tho🫣
Altyazı ekler misiniz
Han Bin could be the host on Singles inferno 3! That would be AMAZING!
I love this season more than the first one im gonna miss them
I LOVE THEIR FRIENDSHIP
We need more of so-e and Sejun please!! Some kind of we got married tv show jajajaajja I really want it!! ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jong-woo is so sweet and pretty. He did the best with all his strong to win the challenge and go to paradise with girl he likes. His effort moved me so much. I think all the girls need someone like Jong-Woo
Producers are trying to create Trouble in paradise? The showed the pool scene btw SK and JY. They didn't show that much footage of the other couples.
It's a game show guys, its lighthearted fun and entertainment. It's concerning how some of you in the comments are so upset and butthurt about certain characters here
Seulki being concerned with jong woo reaction... feels like they are dating during this shoot. Hahaha
Wheres sejun!!!!!!!!
Alguém sabe onde tem em português?
i wonder if the couples are still together...i wish they talked about that
I wanted to see them watch Episode 9!!!  Why did it cut short of that?
So who are the real couple after the show ended ?
Did the final couples get to go to paradise one last time off-camera? Do we know if there might be interviews about what happened after the final couples formed? Everyone just flew home?
Poor Sejeong. So impressed that she doesnt hold grudges or resentment honestly ( especially towards Minsu) . Shes a good person.
Jonwoo was really kind, but NO couple from either Season 1 or 2 had the chemistry and tension of Jinyoung and Seulki had.  I was low-key disappointed he chose Junwoo. He gives me more "Friend" vibes 😭
I feel the person Seulki should have picked was Jinyoung because it's SO obvious that she's into him. I think it's cute that she's at a loss for words with him, and she gets shy when he's around. I know a lot of people think he's some sort of player for talking to other girls/flirting, but I found that he has always been honest about his feelings. He wanted to get to know other people so that in the end he will know, without a doubt, who it is he wants to go for. I see nothing wrong with that. He even truthfully told Nadine what was running through his mind when he picked her for their date. With that said, I adore Jungwoo. I think he's so sweet, honest, and true to himself. Any girl would be lucky to have him. I just hope Seulki didn't pick him because she felt he was the safer choice and she knew he was obsessed with her. Her talk at the end about choosing the person she likes vs the person who likes her was odd to me. It was like her confessing that she chose the person she didn't like lol.
Choi Jong Woo and Shin Seul Ki ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
9:11 Sumpah ngakak bet sama Seulki 😂 ketar-ketir ditonton jungwoo wkwk, mana jungwoo keknya udh nahan emosi biar gk panas wkwk
Bruh I feel bad for Jungwoo Seulki obviously is more into Jinyoung than him even here her hearts fluttering again with the man so didn’t she just pick Jinyoung in the end. To me that’s just unfair for Jungwoo cause he knows she won’t love him the way he loves her her mind is always going to be somewhere else they’re relationship ain’t gonna last
Am I the only one that got the impression that Sejun and So-e are probably not dating irl after watching this? She respects him so much but she doesn't feel like a gf reacting like Seulki was from her reactions. I admire that Sejun is a true gentleman, never crossed boundaries and truly wanted her to be happy which shows how selfless he is. He was put into a tough spot at the get-go being that he fell for the one girl who gave her heart to someone else. Regardless, I hope they stay friends and perhaps one day they may become more. And, if not, I hope he finds true love one day.   This cast was amazing because they all seem like genuinely good people. I can't stand trashy American dating shows and wasn't going to watch this but a friend recommended it. I'm so glad I did! I appreciate the wholesomeness of Korean shows which makes me sound old and a prude haha. Korean shows have ruined all American tv for me!
The production team definitely made jinyoung stand best to Nadine to add suspense. That part in particular was so choppy as if they cut out so many parts and jinyoung looked so uncomfortable, and awkward which is the opposite of his usual personality. I mean look at how everyone reacted! They knew what they were doing. If jinyoung had his choice he would've acted the same toward Nadine as he did with minsu when saying bye. Why would it be any diff? people need to stop hating
I love how the new members came in a bit earlier than the newer ones of last season. They made much more of an impact so they were just as memorable.
seoeunnnnn
Does anyone know if Soe and Sejun are still together cause im rooting for them , my favourite couple
Young Jin really brought everything mix up in this season. Even though he didn't get what he wanted in the last episode, he's still my favorite.  and Nadine too! Atta Girl!  I love seeing them both.  For my predictable partner, Yoong Jae & Seo Eun, you two looked good together from the start! Sweet!
Jinyoung and Seulki’s scenes still make my heart flutter. Too bad they weren’t endgame. They made the most sense as a couple, imo.
Between Jinyoung and Suelki you see dopamine(excitement,euphoria)kicks in,while Jong woo and Seulki you see Serotonin(felt more stable, comfortable)..Between Dopamine and Serotonin , Serotonin will establish a more stable relationship..
at last the second lead syndrome I wished for! xD
I love the way jinyoung is.. Charming boy.. Thank u for making this show more special..
Awww she actually cared what Jong woo would think ❤❤❤
Idk but it seems like Seulki and Jongwoo are really dating
My guy jinyoung carried the whole show
Jinyoung calling himself a scientist that failed an experiment has me in tears 😂
Which ones are still dating??
Excellent editing! Thanks for this
when can we see their final reaction of the last two episodes? 😁
One thing I really love about this cast is that no one is the “bad guy/girl here. Everyone was so kind, fun and honest about their feelings. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them!
Se Jeong and Han Bin were so underrated
if there will be a season 3, please give the contestants an option to reject paradise dates.
Thanks for this reunion! Wish we had one for season 1!
I can't imagine this session withou jinyoung... He came late but still done the work...what a guy
jin young was the strongest contestant .he did so well .as nadine said he did really mixed everything up
9:00 Hanbin knows everything 😭😭😭😂
I really liked jinyoung personality. He is very honest and entertaining. He made the show more interesting. Seul ki wanted him to be a simp like Jong-woo but it’s just not his personality. He respects himself enough which I respect. He came to the show to find find love which means he had to talk to everyone in the show but seul ki wanted all that attention to herself. At the end she choose who was right for her and I respect her decision. But jinyoung did his best in getting to know the others and followed his heart in the end. He is a fun and honest individual so I don’t understand the hate towards him
nadine best girl
I like how seulki's so worried about what Jongwoo's feeling as he watches the vid 😂
Jongwoo happy ending
I want to watch Han Bin in a korean drama . He looks like an actor 😍😍😍
Jinyoung and Seulki should totally go Paradise for a 2nd time. But they are both popular, they hardly have time to catch up after their first visit tgt. 😭
i was rooting for seulki and jinyoung, but he gave seulki only wishy washy answers. she gave him so many opportunities to say some assuring words to her, but he didn't and only played hard to get. in their last conversation she kind of confessed to him, but he just voiced his doubts about the future and said he wanted someone stable and that he couldn't provide for his girlfriend. i understand that he had concerns, but it wasn't the right moment to voice them when all she wanted was some assurance from him, it must have felt like a rejection for her.
i was super dissapointed in Yoong-jae for not giving a change to my girl So-e, i stop caring about him the second he broke So-e heart the second time! i just passed his scenes, couldnt stand him anymore!
The iconic scene for me when sejun hold soe hands on helicopter aaaansnxxbnzmzzmznznxnxn im melted
More Sejun-Soe contents please?!?💕
11:15  12:19  13:12  13:50  19:02  25:15
I watched because I saw a clip of Nadine, but in the end, i was just shipping sejun and soe
Jinyoung remembered what happened in the helicopter 🤣 sejun and soe lang malakas hahaha
justice for sejeong 💖
wheres sejun???
일본어 자막을 넣어주시면 좋겠습니다.
I still wish Seo Eun picked Han Bin.  Seems like she has some feelings for him here where she said that the amusement park was special and a very memorable moment in paradise.
Miss you Se jun 🥹🥹
Nandine 🥰❤️
My fav is NADINE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
they should have put JURAAASIICC PAAARKK theree
just Nadine, she is perfect. if a  man i will go ahead and say hey girl, lets go paradise 😘 and nadine ok and fall in love aaaggghhhhghhhh. oppas didn't know anything. she is a korean cill girll. if i go erasmus to harvard i hope a really wanna see and meet with her. unnie they are too old, you can find someday better than opppas because you ara just goddess love youuuuuu 💕💕💕💕
Jongwoo and jinyoung were like dolphins
jong woo made me cry ☹
Where is SEJUN?????
Wth. They only watched ep 1-8? 😧 Are we gonna get another reunion to watch the finale?
Jinyoung is really funny, cute, macho and humble at the same time. Really hope to see Dex move on to netflix dramas. Will support for sure!
This preview really made me more love Jin-Young, he is so kind to others funny and natural! Hanbin and Jung-woo laughing with him are such a mood! 😂 Soe-eun is also very expressive and has such a presence ! Now it’s over so I’m just rewatching all Jin-Young scenes. Never get enough of him. ❤
I wish they'd put in some of the panel's reactions. Some of them rooted so hard for Jungwoo, it was honestly some of the most touching moments outside the actual cast 🤧
Jinyoung is a great guy ❤ so humble and honest
I wish we got an update on who is still together today.
more plsssss❤
I wish this  show would let the contestant play other games. Those game they played, practically based only on physical strength. They should have play some fun games where they can express their personalities and intelligents.  something  like guessing names, words through mimic, painting.
I wonder who is really dating each other from the show, is there real love success?
Se-jun the best ❤
Wait, didn’t seul ki tell jin young that she was rooting for him when they talked privately? And now she’s saying she was rooting for Jong woo? Or did I mix something up
wait there's no ep 3?? 🥲🥲🥲
I loved how everyone was fangirling and fanboying over Sejun's entry 😂😂 He should have been from the start
ARE ANY OF THEM STILL TOGETHER? i need to know lol
So... will we get a reaction of episode 9 and 10 as well.. or??
Now tell me how to get over the emotional damage that I've got since the show ended
soe smile... there's definitely something going on with sejun! hope we know soon 🥺
Where's Sejun?
Lmaa Sejun is too funny he looked so serious at first but he is the funny guy
this was probably right after filming, they might have broken up since seulki and jinyoung were caught on pictures together. the real end game
I still tear up when I see the guys last match and jongwoo‘s face when he found out he won 2nd place😭😭😭
I still tear up when I see the guys last match and jongwoo‘s face when he found out he won 2nd place😭😭😭
This is why i like Jinyoung
31:13 Gentlemen - Lets do a N with our hands! Ladies (except Nadine) - Do cutesy signs and wave, everyone! Nadine - oh, are we waving goodbye? 😂
Quiero subtítulos en español 🙉
I have been seeing a lot of comments saying “Jinyoung” is a red flag so I genuinely wanted to ask ,what made everyone come to that conclusion… I think he came late on the show so personally for me at was understandable for him to be talking to everyone and also keeping his options open  He was attractive and probably knew that a lot of the girls were attracted to him but he never made either one of them feel small and joked around with them but the difference was so clear when he was with Seulki that he liked her.Even the girls knew …I didn’t see any mixed signals at all lmao it was so clear who he liked…the way he would joke around with her e.g speak in a formal tone when he was messing with her ,look for her and even when he came back from paradise when she was left behind ,he wanted to know everything 😀😀like it was a no brainier …for me…he just doesn’t voice how he feels but you can literally see it in his actions and interactions.Maybe it’s cause I’m also not good at voicing how I feel that’s why I understood him😃 Being attractive and having people attracted to you doesn’t make you a playboy 😭😭
So-e is in the first respondent..if im not mistaken..
Seo-e and Nadine my best girl in this show!! But I like seo-e tge most...... rooting for her success..
Why does it feel like JY still has lingering feelings?😭 from his reaction, just low key. And maybe a mixture of regret too. Eyes can never really lie
I really wanted a seulki and jinyoung ending💔
is theree anyy part 3 ??? omggg
Maybe it's me but I don't really understand how people can cry for this.  I mean they meet for only 10days if I'm not wrong so why crying. It's not the end of the world and I don't think that it's also a love that is going to last forever.  Maybe some of them actualy felt hurt and everything but I don't really understand this reaction. Maybe I am the only one that feels like this.  What do you think?
I am happy that jung woo and seulki are together yaaa
Sejun where are you???😂
i loved how the essence of the show remained about the same as the 1st season. it wasn't like overly dramatic and jealousy all over the place, it again had that friendship among the cast and felt about the same as the first season........i'm glad it maintained it. maybe that's why single's inferno is better than other dating shows. plus i like the concept of paradise.....it actually alters the human behaviours in a very good way, we only think of our feelings and ideal type and leave the complexity of what the other person's age and job is, which is quite a deciding factor while having a relationship
Sejun, So-e, Jongwoo, Nadine and Hanbin are my favs and they're the best! ❤️❤️
It was unfortunate that Se-jun was not here, I really wanted to see him react to their show especially his scenes with So-e because they are the reason why I watched the show. But I think he's too busy with his work so he wasn't able to come here. Nevertheless, I'm rooting for all the casts, I wish that their friendship last forever. I really enjoyed the show 💗💗💗 SI2 파이팅!!!
me watching more than 5 times a day
Jongwoo is really into Seulki, I hope she will keep and treasure him. He was so persistent and he always thought about what she would feel.
Hanbin looks so fine here??? Jongwoo reminds me of Squirtle
Jong woo is just a guy actor he show his emotional every where so that the girl can focus him he his just sh#t
Can we just take a moment to appreciate Han-Bin and everything that he did for everyone, while always keeping a smile and making sure everyone was okay! He was always the one to help in the games and was there to listen to anyone whenever they needed it! I dont think he gets enough recognition for the role he played overall!
9:18 Does it mean that Seul-ki cares about Jungwo’s feeling about that pool scene cause they’re still together ? 😭 SPILL THE TEA YALL
I used to really fall for someone (my ex boyfriend) that i hardly meet eyes with him, really nervous whenever i’m with him, i fall for him whenever i saw him, felt so much butterflies in my stomach, but sadly our relationship didn’t work. and even after 2 years i broke up with him, i still feel butterflies in my stomach whenever i heard his name.   but i end up marrying someone whom i’m not really interested at first. i’m not even nervous at all whenever we’re on date. he’s just like a friend to me. but, idk, it’s really peaceful whenever i’m with him. and it’s really the best choice marrying him. he’s caring, he’s like a best friend to me, i’m being myself whenever i’m with him. It’s really the best love tbh, a peaceful love that i never knew i needed.  it’s like seulki with jong woo and jinyoung. a guy like jinyoung will make her heart beats.  but a guy like jungwoo will gave her a “paradise” that she actually needed.
the tense between jinyoung and jongwoo even after the show :(
JY is enjoying the wrestling scene of himself while everyone else found it so intense to watch lol
jinyoung and seulki 🖤 they will always bet fav couple
My guy jinyoung almost won but still a good try.
What's with So E's tone? It's awfull. A fully grown woman talking like a baby :| CRINGE 😂
This season had great friendship vibes even between rivals. I hope they continue to be friends even after the show!
To the people who said Seulki is being safe for the final result by saying she’s picking friendship over lover, I would humbly disagree.   Her relationship with Jungwoo reminds me so much on how I started my relationship and my bf lmao. Tbh I’m not that interested with my bf when we were at the talking stage, but somehow as the time goes by I fell for how he’s putting so much effort in me, showing so much interest in me, YET is not being pushy and very considerate of me despite I’m not showing that much interest in him. I took a really long time to open up to someone and like Jungwoo, my bf respect that.  We’ve been about 8 months together now, once he asked me how I felt during our first date. He said that he was extremely nervous but happy. I said that I somehow felt really comfortable as if I’ve known him for years. I managed to enjoy our time together eventhough I’m usually super awkward around people that I’m not familiar with. I can somehow see that on Seulki and Jungwoo when they were together in Paradise.  As you can see on the show, Seulki actually tries hard to make Jungwoo happy by saying she really wants to win the Sireum fight to bring Jungwoo together with her to Paradise. Ya’ll might see this as if she’s only trying to show gratitude to him and maybe she did. But after doing so, only then she realize that whatever makes Jungwoo happy, makes her happier. I once felt the exact same feeling to my bf on our early days.  As what Seulki said at the end of the show, Jungwoo was the one who actually brake her stereotype to actually like someone who likes her more. And at the end, instead of Jungwoo always approaching her first, she wanted to try approach him first next time. That was one of the unusual approach I did to my bf as well on our early stage. And I still remember how he was shocked and even told me that he thinks that it was his first time seeing me asking question to him about his interest, instead of him asking me😅  So what I’m trying to say is love is not only about how people makes you feel butterflies on the stomach the first time you met them, sometimes it might be on how you can be the most comfortable self around them. (the butterfly part might comes later once you’re really into them later tho :P)  P/s: notice how Seulki said Jungwoo should close his eyes during her scene with Jinyoung as if they’re currently in a somewhat special relationship hehe anyways, I truly support them!❤
I actually like Seulki and 💯 support Jongwoo. I don’t get why it’s so hard to understand how sincerity, consistency, and persistence can move a woman’s heart? Also, y’all are just too salty to understand that a rich, young, and pretty woman can have a choice. Jinyoung is chill and is a great friend material, but I don’t know about being lovers with him. Good for seulki that’s she was able to realize her worth and give a great guy a chance.
poor sejeong we didnt even get to hear what she feels after the show
i havent watch the first one but i excited to see the jinyoung seulki moment <3
Seulkiii
I love jin young comments
In real life i might fall for someone like Hanbin and i think other people will fall for man likes him too  his vibe and energy make me feel like i can be my self and being comfort when i'm with him ps. yoong jae is really man in dream that so ideal and can't find easily in normal life  even if i found I really don't know how to make someone so perfect like him to feel things to me ;__;
I think jinyoung made the show this season. it was getting kinda boring after 2 ep but his entry at the end of ep 3 suddenly made the show very competitive and interesting 😄
Missing Sejun so much 😢
So-e and Hanbin were my favorites from the beginning, I was kinda hoping they would like each other, but it's kind of even nicer to see that they became friends, bonding over their respective unilateral love for others
I need a part 3,4,5,6 to this reaction 😂😂😂
11:26 13:20 13:54
Why always seulki’s screen? BORING
it would actually be very interesting to see the reaction from the last two episodes.
Es una pena que no esté Sejun. Me hubiera gustado ver más interacciones de él y SoE ❤️🥺
Seeing how Seulki panicked at 9:12 that Jongwoo will be able to watch her swimming pool scene with Jinyoung,  I felt that they are really dating after SI2 🤭. You can often notice too how SK gave attention and made comments whenever JW appears on the screen.  I was rooting for SK❤JW so I'm overjoyed that she chose JW at the end.
not gonna lie i kinda like seulki now
I’m still for jinyoung and seulki 😭 the miscommunication and lack of reassurance ughhhh
so.. just like the show, the reaction was all about seulki-jongwoo and jinyoung'........... thanks for nothing
Saudades Sejun
This is fun to see...jin young alwys choose suel ki..🤩🤩😍
I wish the asked sejeong more questions😢
I feel like Nadine would have alot more rizz if she spoke Korean fluently, there was definitely a communication gap between her and the male participants bc of the language barrier
Hanbin kinda looks like Nam Joohyuk
Look at soe reaction when sejun arrived aww my heart ❤️❤️❤️
Nooooooooo why did you guys skipped the jurassic world huwaaaaaa
I'll lowkey miss the cast, they were more charismatic to me than the 1st season cast. Also, it wouldn't be as interesting to watch if JY wasn't there, he made everything way more exciting. Altho Seulki didn't choose him he still looks like a sensible, honest and kind guy and I enjoyed watching him on the show
So am I the only one who still hopes for Nadine and Hanbin 🥹
21:58 Are we all really just gonna pretend that we believe those tears were actually for Jongwoo? Okay. 😂😂
Ugh it's such a shame Sejun wasn't in this! He was the greatest mood maker during the whole show, I really appreciated him and the way he took care of So-e
That Seul-ki and Jinyoung pool scene was literally "THE iconic scene" as Nadine said, the tension and chemistry filled the air, I felt like I was holding mky breath while watching it
If there wasn’t a plastic surgery, Seul-ki won’t have that kind of face. Let it sink
Nadine is so quiet here. Seul-ki always wants attention 🙄 she always talks, she always wants to be the center of discussion. 🙄
Jong woo's story really did sell this season. It brought more emotion than last one even when it was a love triangle lol he deserves to get advertising to his shop   Happy with the ending (even when it doesnt translate in relationships outside the show). Hope no one gets too much hate, ive seen fans of JY going crazy in the comments bcs seulki didnt choose him 😭 girl he is a youtuber who never went to college and she is rich future pianist come on lol be realistic
Sub indo please 😭
En sup español porfavor
8:37 lol love seeing Jung woo jealous 😂❤️
It's so cute how seulki was worried if jongwoo was going to see her moments with jinyoung 🥹🤍
It’s funny how different Korean version comments vs here.
Tbh idc who seulki chose in the end, she herself said that she chose who liked her more, not who she liked more. And nothing can top that pool scene w jin young and her. The chemistry was insane. Jin young saved this season orelse it woud've been so boring. He gave the show the excitement, drama and  i totally understood getting to know other people. Noone can just stick w a person who they didn't even knew for more than a week. In my opinion jung woo is the red flag, how can a person be too obsessed w only one person for the whole time? Like in the real world it ll be too weird and obsessive.
I really like the way Jin Young commented all scenes. He seems honest about what he's talking and doesn't bragging about himself. Also he's funny 😂 He's a cool guy 👍🏽 people might see him a 🚩 in the show especially when he didn't choose Nadine (including me act) I think bcs he feels like he's not good enough for Nadine after finding out about Nadine's background. And this whole part 1&2 reunion make me change my view about him. He's a good man 😊👍🏽 Jin Young oppa, you did great in the whole show. Thank you for participating in to make this season way more intense. I wish you Good luck. May everything you do goes well 🙂❤️ last but not least, I love every cast in this season. They're all so good n interesting ✨   *And please audiences stop asking where's Sejun. He might bz with his work that can't be avoided. I'm sure he wants to come too.
I'm a fan of the program. I want to have Thai cc.
The production team made jinyoung look bad. Why make him stand next to Nadine? I get that it added suspense but he’s getting so much hate bc of it. You can tell he felt so awkward. He is nothing but a good sport, cheering for jongwoo and cheering him up during this interview. Jongwoo and dongwoo are both bad sports and showed nothing but jealousy during the season- so cringey to waych
Jongwoo❤Seulki😍😍😍
So siguro may suyuang naganap after nito. Diba seulki and jongwoo? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Jinyoung 100% saved the show. Before that I almost stopped watching bc it was getting so boring. Idk why everyone is hating on jinyoung. He was true to his feelings and worried about seulki future, he took everything into consideration but ppl are misunderstanding they’re saying he messed it up and made her more confused. He was thinking long term. Also for ppl hating on him for standing next to Nadine- if you rewatch he looked hesitant about standing next to her and awkward, it wasn’t his usual natural self. Pretty sure the production team instructed him to do that to add suspense, ppl need to relax.
Are any of the couples still together?
Jin young was the MAIN CHARACTER OF THE SHOW the amount of excitement he put is unbelievable
It’s a shame that sejun is not here but I really love the chemistry between the cast of single’s inferno season 2!! They look so natural! Their friendship tho😍❤️
I love Jinyoung. You can see in every way he talk, HE KNOWS how to respect people. I'm stand the right man.
We need sejunnnnn too
R they dating in real life???
Jinyoung’s reaction to that helicopter scene of SoE at Sejun made me freaking laugh longer than I should! Hahahahaha
Will there be more unreleased clips??? pls say yes, pls say yes. 🥺
¿Por qué sin subtitulos en español? No todos sabemos el idioma inglés.
In the midst of the hectic love triangle/pentagon they were brewing, there came "The Sejun-Soe's" unexpected chemistry.
We need sejun reaction too
Alguém legenda isso pelo amor de Deus
I wish they show the casts reacts to Seul Ki and Jong Woo scene in Paradise
My man Hanbin looks so fine!!! He honestly looks the best here… PETITION to make my guy Hanbin an actor please!!!!
Seulki became cutiee now especially when she was concern about jong woo’s feelings 🥹❤️
Wheres sejun?
Honestly, Jin Young saved this show with all the plot twists and Sejun’s funny personality. Also, I love Sejong. She was not desperate. Yes, I know it's a dating show but she was not weak. Love her!
oh I wish they review the last 2 episodes as well. With Sejun this time I hope🙏🙏🙏
Will we ever get updates? Want to know if the couples stayed together. What happened after the show? Is there a part 3? Jong-woo I love you❤
I'm Seulki Jinyoung team, but couldn't help but notice on 4:02, Seulki eyes look at those scene with tender expression. I think she has soft spot for Jungwoo
If sejun was there earlier I swear most of the girls would fall for him he's so funny and charming I wish he did the interview too
Its just me or they didnt show to much about Nadine, like I just watched cuz of her like 🥲
i wish se jeong had gotten more screentime in the show she was my fav
Jinyoung NAURRR THAT'S LITERALLY HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF FROM THE OTHER DATING SHOW 😭😭😭😭😭
Sub español porfavor 😭
Seulki ❤️
are the casts already following each other on instagram?
I will miss them so much❤️😭
I MISS SOE AND SEJUN TOGETHER ❤ 😢 😭
So-else has that vibe of Shin Hye-Sun .. Our Mama from Mr Queen drama. 😂
Everyone saying that jinyoung has been more true to his personality but the one who showed vulnerability was only jongwoo.
Seulki and Jin Young 😢 chemistry is so strong 💪🏾
Jungwoo really worked hard. His scenes was so emotional, i was in tears when he win the game😢
Se jun was so funny and cool in the competition when he said "i dont care"🤣😂👍
Hanbin is so nice and adorable
Soe Eun is so nice to everyone and she is very wise. It would be great to have a big sister like her 💖
I liked JinYoung’s haircut on the show . More becoming him .  😊
I wish Sejun was here!!🥺
I am in love with han bin & soe friendship.  Han bin is so cool and amazing person♡
20:55 I HAD A FEELING JINYOUNG HAD NO IDEA WHAT NADINE WAS SAYING. he just wanted her to feel comfortable w conversing in a language shes familiar with. i was hoping theyd make it omg 😭😭
20:41 i look like a scientist who failed an experiment🤣🤣  I swear this guy always makes me laugh🤣🤣
I think seulki made the best decision for herself by choosing Jong woo as far as this show is concerned 👍🏼
idk why but I really wanted Seulki to choose Jinyoung despite Jungwoo being a sweetheart....I really wish they could get another chance to go to the Paradise together so that the scenario could be a lil bit different....
Ahhhh i want more.mI really like these casts more than first season !
PART3
Jinyoung carried singles inferno 2. Not only he’s charming he has a great personality.
Hanbin and Sejeong is a type of person that i would like to friend the most. Hanbin is naturally being nice to everyone while sejeong being compassionate with people.
sejun would’ve been the unfiltered icebreaker if he was here… damn they need to do another reaction but only with sejun…give that man the spotlight
Trừ việc không được SK chọn ra. Những điều tốt nhất trong chương trình này đã thuộc hết về JY rồi. Được sống đúng với con người mình, ngông nghênh, phóng khoáng, thẳng thắn. Chắc chắn JY là người có nhiều những trải nghiệm nhất trong chương trình. Mặc dù người con gái anh ấy thích không chọn anh ấy, lý do vì sao thì không ai biết. Nhưng tất cả mọi ng đều biết. JY là người mà SK cảm thấy rung động, đúng chuẩn với hình hài nguyên thuỷ của 2 chữ "Tình Yêu" nhất! Thế là quá đủ với anh ấy rồi!!!
youngjae was really a jerk because he helped jinyoung attack jongwoo, luckily he won😭
I love how seulki keep saying Jong woo is innocent, I can feel she's adore his puppy energy 😂 must protect
it would've been even funnier for them to see the scenes in between where the MCs comment on their behaviour and actions😂
Seulki took her time to discern and made the right choice. She mentioned Jongwoo broke her old standards of going for her "ideal type of guy" thereby she would assert herself to have the person she likes. But with Jongwoo, she finally saw the light and his natural charms. He was very empathetic and knew how to respect boundaries. He has good social sensitivity.  While Jin-young expressed his feelings to Seulki, his candid remarks somehow conveyed a different message to her. Thereafter, Seulki picked it up from there. She figured that there is one person who readily and evidently exhibits sincerity both verbal and non-verbal. Who is she to dismiss that? Also, heaven was indeed in Jongwoo's side.   I cried and cheered for Jongwoo and Seulki. ❤ I am happy to see you, love birds! Keep the love alive please!
Se Jun is the only one that is loved by every single one, female and male contestants. I hope Soe will keep this man with her forever.
I think seulki and jong woo is still together until now..hoping🙏🙏🙏
27:44 tbh I watched this show just for fun I don’t really believe someone would fall in love genuinely in just 7 days (if you watch Lee Dahee’s latest drama wherein she’s a PDnim in a reality dating show like this, you will not trust this kind of reality show to be “real) BUT Jongwoo showed differently, he really genuinely like Seulki. I was teary eyed during this scene, RESPECT for Jongwoo. I’m glad Seulki choose him at the end because he really deserves her eventhough there’s some part of me that somewhat don’t like what Seulki showed in some parts of the show but still I’m glad they ended up with each other.
I was eagerly waiting for  Nadine and Jin young "Jurraaaasiiiicccc Worlddd"  scene , but sadly they didn't include it😂.
9:17 hahahahahaahah cutiesss <3
Love how concerned seulki to jongwoo when they watched the iconic pool scene with jinyoung. Seulki: JONG WOO CLOSE YOUR EYES!!  😭🥺 i hope they're really dating in real life 🤍🤍🤍
Façam a dublagem para Português, pra sabermos o que eles acharam depois de ver, por favor .... 😶🇧🇷
Nadine was the best . Lots of love . Hope you to stay happy and hope you deserve the best!!!!
Okay, firstly, THANK YOU to The Swoon for having these interviews. Such a fun way to recap some of the highlights and enjoy the cast's reactions to everything.  2) Slightly cringe having them all together watching moments that would make some of them uncomfortable, but we live for the mild awkward tension and appreciate everyone's honesty 3) I like that we got to see more depth to Jinyoung's personality - his more arrogant side but also his more insecure side. His perspective on how his first date with Seulki went and how she behaved with him versus Jongwoo was really interesting 3) I am sad Sejun is not here but also love that every single one of them chose him as the favourite. He was awesome. 4) I don't think I will recover from how intense the men's wrestling game was 5) Low-key impressed with the confident energy Seulki is bringing in this interview since she seemed a lot more nervouse or reserved in Inferno 6) Nadine has totally watched the entire show with her friends before this interview I bet
Seulki ❤️jongwoo
i think Jinyoung made Seulki heart flutter but JW made her feel comfortable and appreciated. Due to Jinyoung going to paradise every night and not having much interaction with Seulki after their first night, the interactions became awkward and it was that lack of flow in conversation which i think ultimately led to Seulki choosing JW. The couple you can see that contrast was Youngjae and Seo eun and how they would talk until the morning.
AAAAA I'VE BEEN WAITING THISSSS
Han-bin's hair thoooo😩✨️
Where to see more of SeJun & SoE
It's really out of the context but  hanbin likes most of the pictures of other inferno contestants but not nadine's.  Don't get me wrong but i think something is going on  between them. I hope 🤞
was not planning to watch single's inferno but when i saw sejun and so-e's clip from tiktok, it instantly changed my mind. where can i find my own sejun?? lol.
14:00- Haha i love jinyoung. He was the mvp of this show along with Sejun.
아니 여자출연자(슬기ㆍ서은)와  진영  헤어가  왜  변함? 인물을 다 가림ㅜㅜ
barely see Sejong again in this clip as well . I really feel bad for her. She is really pretty, cool and hot tho . She was my picked.
Seul ki like Jin young she went with jungwoo only because he was so much in to her but i think seul ki should have listen to her heart and should have choose Jin young rather then then jungwoo because liking should be from both side i will not like someone just because someone likes me feelings should be mutual.
I need their reaction for ep 9-10 Swoon! Pleaseee! I need SeulKi and Jung Woo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dong woo has the good looks and stable job and wealth but he is a bit too confident about himself and comes across arrogant. I think he’s the only guy that came out of this show negatively.
Nadine 🧨💕
Where the “jurassic wurrrl” at 🥺🥺🥺🤣🤣
Pongan subtitulos español
Spanish please
I love this commentary movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Seo-eun's hairstyle looks very different from the time when she was at Inferno ❤️❤️
I felt like the men had more personality than the women, especially JY and Sejun.
Yeah it's funny Jongwoo was guessing all wrong but there is so much more to dive into why are we spending 5 minutes of their reaction on this 😭
I really like to see how Jin Young is not a sore looser.. The way he always consoles Joong Woo everytime He got jealous, is very manly.. He is a good guy....
Is it just me or does anyone else see the similarities look wise of Jin Young and Jungkook for BTS
OKAY BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY R UP TO NOW
lol just jin young and jong woo talking.
Masih tetep tim Jinyoung Seulki 😭😭
soe sejun
Why u didn't aired when so-e cried for this review, I want to know how Yoon jae reaction 🥲
anyway my ship is sailing so i'm fine  sejun and so e ❤
We are waiting for season 3!! with the more episodes
This season, everyone gets along so well. The show was extremely funny, and I especially enjoyed the times when I got second-hand embarrassment.
🤎🫶🏻
not hanbin leading the reaction like the showhost 😂
Yeah why missed sejun 😢
among other men why do I like hanbin the most ? even from the beginning to the end of the show, I feel like he has some maturity in him which he covers up with his cute face and bubbly personality also he is a chef  That's lowkey fascinating for me 🌹
Nadine was my favorite throughout the season. She was so awkward but cute. I love how once she was in paradise with JY she was able to express herself and open up to him!
we need sejun and soe more
Pls bring back Han Bin for another season, him and Se Jun were effortlessly hilarious. This season was sooooooooo much better than the previous season
JW got what he deserve ... Suelki and JW best ... 🍁
7:59 Jongwoo : beauty and the beast😭😂
Soe lucked out the most. Sejun is an amazing guy.
They really show the bare minimum for sejun and so e
Is it just me or is Soe absolutely glowing here
Se jeong is soo beautiful for me but she got no drama in this season it's surprising
SeJun , why are you not there? Where can we see more of u and SoE ❤❤
CHOI JONGWOO best boy !!! He deserve everything! My standard is way too high because of him 😭seulki doesn't deserve a guy like him 😂
LEE NADINE I HOPE YOU MEET SOMEONE AMAZING..XXX
sejun the goat
I just appreciate so-e for her decision to go with hanbin in Paradise. I think she was also being so considerate towards her unnie - and yeah it’s a loser thing to do in a dating show, but just goes to show how genuinely sweet she is. It’s just also great that sejun is quite secure with her decision. They’re a good couple who locked into each other from the start.
Nadine the best one in my opinion 💯🔥
SEASON 3 Already 🥺
Everyone is really charming on this show. My fave are Nadine, Soe, Sejun, Hanbin, Jongwoo, Sejeong and Jinyoung. I'm really hooked on this show and really rooting for these people. Kudos to all of them and of course the people who worked behind the camera! It's indeed a phenomenal season 2!
More content with them please 😢
even tho i'm a JY fan, in the end he was just attracted to SK, whereas JW had real feelings for her, and she was smart enough to realize that.
Let’s be honest Jin young carried this show and this interview!!! His in site on this interview were honest and funny… love him or hate him this guy was true to himself! Ps… Sejun also carried👌 everyone was great as well!
It's so hard for JW to watch SK's paradise scene with JY🥲 also when JW was watching SK cry I wonder what he felt then after seeing things before😂
the bond this group has is incredible. i hope their friendship will last longer. 💞💞
Jin Young has so much personality and is perfect for this show (imo). I'd rather take this personality than someone like the other guy, Jong woo, who seems like a stalker. The other guy seems like he has an obsession or something. It's creepy. I've been in that kind of relationship. He was like this at first and when I didn't want to be in that relationship anymore, the guy got su/icid/al. It was very hard for me to get away in that relationship. 🫥
Soeun has become even more prettier... she really has that mature vibes that can attract you.. really pretty and really wise. Her personality is also good. How can such person exist? I'm envioussss~
why no sejun 😭
For me, every scene between seulki and jinyoung was heart fluttering but then this guy was thinking she had low energy when she was with him and high energy when she was with the other guy 🤯
I doubt.. of suel ki ..choosing  jwoo than jin yong
Season 1: Song Jia>>> Season 2: Kim Jinyoung>>>
I wish theres a part 3!
A youtuber called Darcie... She's so similar to Seul-ki😮
legenda em português!!!!!!
20:00 lol Nadine and Seul Ki lowkey hate Minsu. She sound so like a bitch here.
I want more unreleased clips of last date before the final day of single inferno. Like the date of Nadine and Jinyoung, Jongwoo and Seulki and specially Sejun and Soe. 🙏❤️
I feel bad for Jinyoung but i am happy for seulki and joongwoo👍.....and i don't like the way people are hating Jinyoung for not picking nadinee and stand beside her for few minutes...which iam 60% sure was scripted to bring more drama😮‍💨. Anyway congratulations to all the couples hope it last long.
I like so e and se jun pair, hanbin also I like him so much why no one like him she so charming and beautiful and chef I want there I want him she ismy boyfriend and also junwoo like she put in effort win there love for sel ki hats off and she is also very handsome this people I like in single inferno 2😍
i enjoyed season 2 more than season 1 <333
Are we gonna see a reaction vid for epi 9 and 10 as well ? Pls say yes !
Hate me all you want, but Seul-ki is definitely falling for Jin-young
Jongwoo❤️❤️sejun❤️❤️hanbin❤️❤️
The scene that captures so many hearts
Idk why I can't watch the season 2, I just not into it
진영씨 덕분에 많이 설레고 행복했어요 감사하고 응원합니다!!♡
Maybe unpopular opinion, but here it’s kinda annoying to hear and see Soe talking bluntly about Youngjae again and again, with knowing that Soeun is beside her. I noticed Soeun’s stiff expressions everytime Soe talking bout him
I can't move on from these guys.
now please release more unreleased clip of sejun and soe😭😭😭😭😭 even if it 5 hours long i will watch it till the end, pleaseeeeee🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
seems like seulki really knows jongwoo well when she said “no he meant it” 6:20 i just hope they still dating irl
So e + sejun ✔️ Hanbin sm aku aja yu😄😄😄😄😄
I need oppa Sejun in next part 3
Ini sangat disayangkan karena tidak ada Kim Se jun 😪
They really set the standards high for Season 3. Their friendship is the most beautiful things to see. All of them are so nice to each other. Anyways, my ship Sejun-Soe happily sailing ..
glad Seulki chose Jongwoo instead of Jinyoung, the stunt Jinyoung pulled with Nadine in the last episode really pissed me off, standing near her for so long and making Seulki confused too
Jinyoung should’ve been chosen sad
Seo Eun looks like Go Yoon Jung, Naksu from Alchemy of Soul,    Kim Se Jun looks like Lee Min Ho,      Park Se Jeong looks like Lee Ho Jung from Nevertheless,     Kim Han Bin sometimes looks like Nam Joo Hyuk on certain angles and after reading comments on the girls celebrity crushes, there's some resemblance with Jin Young and Lee Je Hoon
I WANT MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
They have honestly cut a lot of parts. I mean for me, the most important moment was So e and Yoong Jae's inter action but they didn't show it because the focus was on Seul Ki and the admirers. I was atleast expecting to see the part where So E confronts Yoong Jae regarding everything.
I watched this review.. without watching the whole ep.. only watched 2 ep..coz yk..tiktok 😂😂 spoiler..then I know the whole ep.. without watching on Netflix 🤣
"My hearts fluttering just watching it again" - Seulki. I mean SERIOUSLY if this doesnt tell you what Seulki STILL FEELS i dont know what does....even after picking Jungwoo.
I wanted to them to react to the 'Jurassic World' part fr.
I love how Seulki actually looks like she adores Jongwoo, its adorable
Seriously Sejun is the best . Who agree with me 🤣🤣
Best Rank of season 2  1. Kim Jinyoung 2. Kim Jinyoung 3. Kim Jinyoung 4. Kim Jinyoung 5. Kim Jinyoung 6. Kim Jinyoung 7. Kim Jinyoung 8. Kim Jinyoung 9. Kim Jinyoung 10. Kim Jinyoung 11. Kim Jinyoung
I have this hunch that seulki and jongwoo are still together? considering jongwoo was jealous on the pool scene and the fact that Seulki immediately thought about jongwoo and was anxious that jongwoo will watch that scene lmao. Anyways, just a hunch. I wanna see more about youngjae and seo-un!!
if seul ki had chosen jin young ppl would've criticize her bc "nice guys are always left out", but since she chose jong woo, ppl criticize her bc she didn't choose the guy she truly likes, in the end, it's a show and we don't know the actual ppl that are behind it, so ppl should care about enjoying it instead of hating on ppl they don't know and criticizing decisions that aren't for them to make, just an observation based on the comments that I've seen about her decision
Oh my sis said young Jae come to her mind first when she won😢
Lmao 20:40 Jinyoung said that he looked like scientist that failed an experiment. I laugh so hard🤣🤣🤣 he’s so funny🤣
I can't wait to watch the last two episodes T T It's been an emotional rollercoaster. Looking forward to the next season already!!!!
I dislike jongwoo so much. No hate towards him personally but that type of person always with the "victim of everyone and everything" really bothers me. I'm sure he was chosen out of pity. He even cried the night before the finale. So annoying.
HOPE THAT JONG WOO AND SEULKI WILL LAST LONG. really into this couple huhuhu
Diluar dari cerita yang semua cast buat di 10 eps Single's Inferno, aku suka dari sudut pandang mereka yang menurutku dewasa in real life. Mereka tetap jaga good relationship, friendship dan ga menutup kemungkinan mereka saling dukung aktivitas atau jalan masing-masing.  Sebagai penonton yang punya pilihan buat nonton, ambil positifnya dan nikmati apa yang telah disuguhkan.
I wanna see Song Ji Ah (Zia) and Jinyoung in paradise pool together
ขอซับไทยได้ไหมพลีสส
no cuz we need reactions for the last two eps plz
서은님은 앞머리가 없는게 훨씬 예쁘시네요 ❤
im really curious what happened to the couples like really.
Episode 9&10 please with Soe and Sejun reaction uwu... 🥰
I was so happy for jong woo. Every girl wants a man who gives you assurance and a consistent one and jongwoo has all of that. So Seulki made the right decision of choosing him.
Seuiki ❤️ jinyoung O final do reality foi o verdadeiro inferno O casal seuiki ❤️ jinyoung Não aconteceu 💔😭 Seuiki escolheu quem gastava dela E não quem ela gosta 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
덱스 눈치없네 에휴.. 슬기는 너무 좋아서 고장난건데
The thumbnail tho ❤ I understand the three but han-bin and nadine together? 😭❤❤
eps 9 & 10 reaction with sejun please
Not at seulki saying " Jongwoo close your eyes" on her and jinyong pool scene 🤣
Seeing this, they really edited Jin Young as a red flag but I can see he is a very thoughtful person :)
Sub español
I was shocked to see So-e in drama snowdrop and the glory 😍
Of course jinyoung going to be confuse bcs many girls are chasing after him. He’s dodging girls left and right just to be with seulki. He’s human too. Easier for jongwoo since nobody wants him
Nadine 🤍  You did great girl! This one is definitely a new fun experience 😆💕 can't wait what you can show in the future too
소이오늘진짜예뿌다 나딘이도!!!
9:18 “Jong-woo, close your eyes” HAHAHAHAHAH SHES TOO CUTE😩
Whatever happened, I love Jin Young's personality but again this is just a show. Jin Young is the Apple of this show. I need to see more screen play of him in a drama or movie. JY played his character really well. He is the definition of a sad boy i love to watch. He is worth of being him self. He is a fighter, remember. He did not flutter. He fights for a better future. JY's team. Fighting, Dex!!!
SPANISH SUB🙏🙏🙏
I know Seul Ki has crush on JinYoung & that make her look so in love. But I love  seeing her around Jong Woo, over time she looks comfortable & be herself around him. Anyway, good show & sportmanship. Congrats SI 🎉
unexpected ending nga talaga
I want them to be together..... Playing together
We need a part 3/2 , where they watch the last 2 episodes and talk about what happened after the show
I don't even know why so-eun picked super bland young-jae instead of han-bin
Sejun looks like he came straight out of manhwa saving soe, it made me feel at ease for her. Too bad. Se-jeong didn’t find a match, she’s so gorg too.
I like how Seulki's eyes lit up whenever she mentions joongwoo 😍
yes pleasee seo eun and yoongjae i need them together😭
I was cheering so bad for Jin Young! I still am, tbh kkkk
Jinyoung has all my respect… we love u ❤❤ our soldier ❤❤❤
this cast was just SO GOOD
Incomplete reunion without SEJUN. We need another episode with SEJUN please 🥺😭😭
i really really loved seo eun and yoongjae's scenes just by watching them i was always smiling and giggling ㅠ.ㅠ
Jinyoung being a youtuber reaction and make this reaction more interested
This season was way better than season one
I was wondering no one picked Nading was it because guys are intimidated when girls are really intelligent and afraid of not able to handle them? 😂
I liked that Jinyoung stayed true and himself all through... he was honest and not expressive, which is what he was from the beginning.
Jinyoung is literally the best guy here :(( Also jongwoo is such a jealous paranoid weirdo I'm sorry. What do you mean you were sensitive about the fact that hanbin just frickin WAVED at seulki??
they didnt include the iconic JuRrAZic  wOrLd???!!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?
I really enjoyed watching the second season of singles inferno! Thanks<3
I love the show except for sleeping together is for marriage
Seulki saying that Jong-woo should cover his eyes not to see the date between her and Jin-young makes me feel like they are still together. 🤔
One thing for sure, Jong-woo's fight to go to paradise with SK was the biggest nail biter of the 2 seasons. I wept real tears whenever he fell back in the ditch holding onto the opportunity to go with her. Very impressive effort.
is this really the last part?
Its obvoius that Jinyoung always comforted so people will not misunderstood his relationship with Seulki anymore. but i'm lil bit disappointed bcoz they were not ended up together.
My fav jinyoung
My fav jinyoung
Only win is show jinyoung Baki sab ke sab boring feel kra rhe the iss show me
Okay WE WANT EXTRA EPISODE JUST FOR SEJUN!!!!!!…!!!.!.!.!!!
Jinyoung is THE BEST
9:09 Seulki : But the Jongwoo will watch that scene too// jongwoo~yah... CLOSE YOUR EYES 16:08 Seulki : Jongwoo rooting for you (to Sejeong) / ( saw Jongwoo and Sejeong's closeness, on Sejeong's Instagram. Looks like Seulki is jealous, lol)  (She really cares about jongwoo , OMG😭)
The way seul ki said “jong woo close your eyes” after her scene with jin young is really cute and means a lot. Did they stay together?
bro why i feel like seulki still has a thing for jinyoung although shes dating a different guy now?
Jongwoo and Seulki are so cute
Kim jin young shin suel ki you are my idol
💕 Seo & Sejun 💕 update needed!
I believe in JY's 3 second rule. He's a UDT (Seal). In that world, you have to make your assessment of the target quick for your death chances will probably rise immediately on the field. He's good at making the assessment. Just probably still adjusting to society life. JY is rationally thinking "how am I going to help emotionally/financially support a piano major when I'm barely making it myself IRL?"  Seulki has shown us that she's sharp cookie. She knows what she wants and doesn't and will tell you it. I think her final decision was based on her anger at his vagueness ("I'm mad at you about something but I won't tell you.") in the last ep. So she chose JW who probably represents most of the guys who have pursuited her before. She's a pro at handling them.
When suelki said: But then Jongwoo will watch that scene too. Soeun: of course Sk: My Godness Nadine: The whole world is going to watch it. Sk:Jongwoo, close your eyes.   HAHAHAHAH i kennat.
Jinyoung was the all rounder literally an ACE.Since the day he arrived everything in SI seemed so interesting.His aura have that unpredictable charm.
7:13  Jong-woo eyes when she said she'll swim hahahah cute And the way Seulki was worried that Jong woo would watch this part. THEY'RE REAL
jin young seems like he still likes seulki
i was jumping for joy when seulki chose jongwoo,i really hope they are dating ,jongwoo is a lovely man
U really need to give us sejun and soe epa
I really want to know is seul ki and jong woo dating or not
love him or hate him you can’t deny jinyoung literally carried the show from the moment he entered. even the timing when he came in was perfect, and like nadine said "he mixed everything up" lol and though he made things confusing sometimes overall i found him to be a very charming & cool guy who deserved the attention he was getting. he spoke in a way you could tell he was always being true to his feelings, he did not beat around the bush and did not mislead others. he was straightforward yet thoughtful. the second night with minsu was one of the moments for me that truly showed his character. Even as he told her in clear words that he was not interested, i was impressed to see how respectful and considerate he was in his approach.
After watching this video I hope seulki and jong woo are still together , cute couple!!
When I was watching the men's game I was so scared. I was crying when Jongwoo won. I was so happy for him. I miss Se Jun's reaction. Want ep9, 10 reaction with Se Jun plz. Se Jun is my fav character❤️ Also Hanbin is such a good , caring guy❤️ I really loved watching this show.
seo eun is so cool bro
Yong jae doesn't wanna be there 😂
💙💙
I like the way jinyoung smile, when jongwoo feel who went to paradise with nadine, because even jongwoo can feel thag jinyoung likes nadine too.. well his right he has feelings for her aside from seulki, but it was dongwoo who went with nadine
where is Sejun?
If Sejun came there the first day, he would have definitely gotten all of the women's votes....and the men's
They did a great job on casting for this season, better than season 1. Everyone was likable
Are the couples still together?
when hanbin asked jinyoung if he understood what nadine was saying and he said no,then hanbin said he could see it,me and my cousins burst out in laughter
Why didn't Se-jun show up?😭😭 His reaction would've been hilarious, because he is so funny🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩😍
I did not like Seulki's manipulations at all. She tells JW that he is the one she wants to go to Paradise and then to JY that she likes boys like him. Wow, such a 여우
Where is sejun 😥
ONLY PART TWO?
I just came here for So E and Sejun.
At 19:17 you can totally tell that Soe makes So Eun feel so uncomfortable  I get that Soes unrequited crush on YJ was a big plot point especially bc she was SO over the top dramatic about it but from So euns perspective ofc it’s super awkward and annoying. Like its supposed to be their love story and a lot of the focus is on all Soe and how upset and hurt she was.
After watching this, i really was impressed with Jin-Young….. what a class player he is….
Ohhh bring them back to the final review please
All of them could star in one drama together 💗
FYI if you wanna know more about Jinyoung, subscribe his youtube Dex101.
Seo eun can be an MC . She's good in speaking.
Youngjae ổng trầm vậy sao? Cả 2 vid đều nói siêu ít, ổng chỉ yên lặng ngồi xem và nghe mọi người bàn luận.
My heart still hurt bc of seulki jinyoung 😭 i wish them to be the end game
Jong woo you did the best and you deserve the most happiness. I hope you and your love be happy together forever.
People are commenting about jinyoung but i feel Jungwoo was the hidden main character.
I was wondering if seulki and jongwoo are still together?
Jin young is really cool here hahahav
I hate YoongJae for one reason.. He helped JinYoung during that last game, even him knowing the fact that JongWoo never been to paradise.. I was literally screaming WHY HIM?!
Thank you Swoon for featuring Iconic Helicopter scene. i never get tired of watching Sejun being a gentleman to Soe, and shocking faces of Jin Young and Minsu (when Sejun holds Soe's hand), hehe.
By watching this I get the vibe that Seulki and Jongwoo are actually a couple now
I wanted to see more of yoonjae and nadine’s paradise date as friends and their planning on how nadine’s going to get jinyoung 😂
Jinyoung really like sejun tho HAHHAHHAHA He's the only one keep complimenting him that's cool
Sigh why no sejun:(((
most of the screen time is seul ki
It would've been so funny when they also included the Jurassic world~🤣 I wonder what would be there reaction😅🤣
Hanbin looking so damn fine
finally
Is it only me who thinks that Jungwoo looks a lot like jihoon from treasure😁
I’m gonna miss them
Everyone but the male fan favorite Se Jun, such a miss opportunity
That was so fun to watch. It was really a great idea to invite them to talk about it. Wishing the best to everyone o/
7:59 Jongwoo XD
Why sejun didn't join? Is he still sleeping? Hihihi
That scene when Minsu blocked Nadine will forever be ick to me lol
the best couple for me so e and sejun real life kdrama 😭
Jongwoo saying SK and JY’s scene was like “Beaty and the Beast” as if he’s the one to talk with his weird ass overly done gangnam face 🙄
Why do it feels like the story still not at its end. Like if Seulki would talk to Jinyoung there is still somethings thats going to happen. Anyway this is me who thinks that Seulki made the right choice. I know love can grow from security and comfort. But that spark they have is undeniable.
Can't wait for Nadine and Dex's colab videossssss 😚😍,  sooo many people love this ship 🥰🥰
Waiting fiir this
i want someone like hanbin in my life, he is so cheerful and kind
Wish Sejun was here too😭 he carried the show ever since he stepped in lmao
I will never get over Seoun /Yoongjae and Hanbin love triangle. Yoongjae the cool, handsome, reserved guy who becomes cute and assertive for the girl he loves. Soeun the bubbly,loving , beautiful main girl who is always helpful and supportive of people.  Hanbin the young guy who is protective of someone who is elder than him and always by her side even if he is not the one who got choose 😭😭😭.  Yeah someone make this drama come true.  I love all the cast member here,every freaking one of them.  9:47 Jinyoung u are a great person,you cleared doubts from Jongwoo
Will there be a part3??? Huhu this is just sooo good
Ahhh I see how pure and honest my oppa Jin young. He deserves to be respect too. I really appreciate the effort he made and being humble 💗.. More update to all of you unnie and oppa💗
i was so hoping seulki trully stayed with jongwoo, i hope she's true to her feelings instead of staying with him for pity
11:21 SoE : My Man is coming 🤭
This cast is way too perfect 😭 I wanna watch more content of them together
Jurassic world Lee nadine
why seul ki was being emotional, it is because of jin young?
My heart still hurt think about jongwoo
영어 못알아들은 부분 웃김 ㅋ 진영씨 매력터짐
👍👍👍
Sejun was not in the interview but mentioned a lot while Young-jae has barely talking ang barely have a screen time😂
Thoughts while watching this:  - Why do I feel like there still tension between jongwoo and jinyoung. - Jongwoo is totally still in love with Seulki - So eun is uncomfortable with Soe - I want to see that time after the pit battle when they were all quiet and mad in the waiting room - Even to them the pit scene was brutal look at yongjae his uncomfortable when they were throwing Hanbin - except Jinyoung, he seems to be loving the fight😅 - JinYoung is talkative!!hahaha.
Jungwoo-Seulki-Jinyoung triangle drama makes its hard to not watching Single Inferno S2🥲🥲🥲
Sejun is so so cooool🥺🥰
Sub thai pls 😢😢
i'm already missing them 😩
This show was bland until the end, even this. Always focusing excessively in certain cast members (who have nothing much to offer in terms of storyline and development). Worst dating show I’ve watched tbh. Hope they do better in s3, but seeing how people love it so much I doubt. I guess we can expect 2 women and 1 man being courted by everyone and their mommas while the rest of the cast gets nada again.  Ps: you can hate me all you want, I’m just leaving feedback so that maybe Netflix get a grip and makes this show more engaging/interesting.
omggg i miss them already 🙁🙁💕💕
Bruh can they just tell us if they’re still seeing each other
Idk if I'm the only one who finds it uncomfortable to look at dongwoo. He seems so jealous of jungwoo and very inconsiderate of his feelings.
Sejun has his own standard... My boy.......
We need SoE and Sejun!!!!!!!!!!!
My prediction to JinYoung - Seul ki - Jong Woo is right coz after I watched JY other show like Love n Joy, I knew tht the history gonna repeat.. the end result is the same 😔. It's kinda sad coz I was rooting for JY aka Dex
Done with everything! I wish Sejun was here.
At first after watching till ep 2 i stopped watching the show because it was hella boring and was not fulfilling the expectations we had but after JINYOUNG arrived it got interesting and fun!!!
Would like to see more of them especially Jongwoo and Seulki 😭
I really love Nadine ❤
Sejeong deserves so much better! She’s def “girl crush” like Jinyoung so aptly put it
its still so embarrassing to watch that scene where min-su just invades JY and Nadine's conversation.... like girl wtf
Jinyoung is so cool guy..
Jinyoung is the main cast of this season... U lucky have jinyoung
If there is not Jinyoung, I wouldn't watch the show, hahh
Will they also react to the last two episode? It would be very nice to watch
seul ki was into jin young till the last moment yet she chose jong woo because she was grateful tht he only chose her but after watching the show she will realise tht jin young also fell for her till his last moment its just he was not overly expressing it like jong woo
We want sejun
Soeun and youngjae had the BEST chemistry PERIOD.Argue with he tree.
Girls typically fall for guys like jinyoung who is full of charisma and swag then gets their heart broken then blame all men. While guys like jongwoo may seem unreliable at times because they are pure they are the most trust worthy guys to go with
The Swoon, thanks for the pleasant surprise!:)
JinYoung was dying to spill the helicopter tea on 13:54… That moment changed the whole trajectory of the show!!!
Honestly I think seulki made the right choice by picking jungwoo cuz Jinyoung literally tricked us into thinking he would pick Nadine. Jungwoo was so devoted and deserved seulki.
Best Girl Nadine Lee
Kalau pada lihat Jinyoung di Love and Joy pasti bakal tau karakter Jinyoung yang baik dan mudah membuat orang terpesona dan dia sadar akan hal itu dan dia tidak bisa tegas alias gak tegaan makanya kalau mau jadi pasangannya harus kuat mental bakalan lelah ama.perasaanya meskipun dicintai Jinyoung tapi emang dasarnya dia baik tapi gak bisa tegas...
Hanbin is really the group's MC! 🤣 Good job, bibi 🤍
Seulki is traaaash
Best boy Hanbin Sejun  Best Girl Soe Nadine   These 4 for is the only walking green flag in the show 👍🏻🙌🏻   Anyway, this season cast feels much better than the last season
Watching their reaction makes it cringey
Jungwoo my bby
Where is sejun...i like coupel soe and sejun cute coupel
Seulki and jin young couple was best
The fact that nobody ended up with Han-bin is really hurting my soul😭
Jinyoung x Seulgi what a beautiful love  story. What a waste
This made me only like Jinyoung even more....this guy CARRIED the show and THIS review. Absolutely hilarious but also honest. Its just a shame that seulki couldnt see this from the time away from each other. I really do hope they work outside of this
You should have included the “Jurrasic” scene
Youngjae ko lu diem doang si😭
Seulki, my girlfriend and i loves you
Hmm.Friendship over chemistry. Anyway good choice Seulki 👌
jin young carried the whole show. perioddddd
And here I'm,knowing it's my finals and it's injurious to my studies 🥲🥲🥲🥲..still want another part😚😚
Too bad, I was hoping we would see YoungJae and Seo Eun talking more about their scenes..
13:19 SOE'S SMILE HERE 😭❤️❤️
The most anticipated and best couple for me was sejun and soe. We generally tend to incline towards the person we like even if the other person is not treating us the way we deserve but, I feel we can be a lot more happier if we give a chance to the person who like/love us more than our liking towards them
Jong Woo and Seul Ki love you so much
they didn't include the Jurrasic World part, I wish they did HAHHAHAHHA
Even in this Seulki and Jinyoung again has more scenes
MORE CONTENT PLS HUHU
Jongwoo & Seulki , they look so good together! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am rooting for Jungwoo so bad. Go Jung woo
I know it part 2/2 but I really want them to watch last 2 ep too 😭 Gonna miss them like ss1 pls do ss3 and more
역시 상남자 덱스님 늘 남을 배려하는 마음 속은 한 70년산 어른같아 ㅋㅋㅋ
jongwoo-ya close your eyes! so cute
Sejun ❤ So-e
This is a show. Everything has a script. The end goal is to make the cast more popular, and the show more views. Many viewers have high expectations for the results. Do you think someone finds love by participating in this show? Please enjoy and stop forcing the cast to do this or that
At first i don't really like seulki, but as time goes by i started to love her and it was a great and best decision when he chose Jong-woo over the doctor and jinyoung coz he's the most green flag and never look at any woman on the island besides her unlike the two, and I also wants to talk about Dong-woo , the doctor, he was popular to girls at the first episodes then ended up like nothing to women like I didn't even notice him after that, he never makes a move to anyone and it's like he's just there for vacation and nothing else, i like him at first but there's something on his behavior that kind of turn off and red flag to me srry.  And my favorite couple Soe and Se jun ENDGAME!!!! SO GLAD AND HAPPY FOR SO-E! SHE FELL FOR THE RIGHT PERSON! At first i don't like her persistency to the other guy despite being rejected many times but so glad that she finally NOTICE AND REALIZE HER WORTH!! She really did deserves better and luckily Sejun came! Their chemistry is overflowing and Sejun despite joining late he's still manage to become the crowd's favorite <33  To my favorite girl nadine! Tho you didn't end up with any of them but i also think that no one there deserves you! Hope you'll find someone who is right for you and someone whom you don't have to beg for attention and loyal to you <3 but i think you belong with me ;)    And Sejeong the girl who looks like Bae suzy, at the first episode i really thought she would be the most popular among boys coz she's the girl that i find the most attractive out of them. But I'm really shock that she's always left in inferno and no one is giving attention to her. When she walks in before I find her really charismatic for some reason that it bothers me that she never got to go and experience the paradise even once, i think from season 1-2 she's the first person who never got to go to paradise til the last episode :')    And to the most stable couple since the beginning of the show which is so-eun and the boy (i forgot his name) i feel like they would last for a long time after this show coz they we're the most compatible with each other, and not to mention the guy is such a green flag, and very appealing also looks caring, gentleman and manly attractive, even tho So-e kept on asking him to pay attention on her it's amazing how he was never swayed even tho that would hurt the feelings of So-e, he only has his heart and loyalty for one girl and I admire him for that. But felt bad for my girl So-e :(( well it's fine now coz so-e is in the better hands that she deserves.
20:42I look like a scientist who  failed an experiment 🤣😂🤣
perseverance , hard work and keep on trying will make ur dream come true , the example from  Jong-woo. Girl need peace of mind
Господи спасите меня от смущения
Уберите детей от экранов, там бассейная химия!!!!!!!!!
In my opinion I think Jin young should learn more about himself than look for someone 99% he wasn’t sure about his feelings and didn’t make them clear to Seulki and confused Nadine even at the end… I find it disrespectful.
they need to ask the real question, whos still together after the show cmonnn
I truly done get what they see in seul-ki she’s so boring 🫤 I mean she really nice polite girl but her personality is so boring, and I don’t think she’s stunning, like she’s pretty but not stunning??? I don’t think she’s really being herself either but rather playing up to this Korean idea of what a woman should be. I don’t mean any of that disrespectfully I truly just don’t get it? Or see it???
Извините, но как они это смотрят?!??!?!?!?!?!?! Я думала помру от смущения на сцене с бассейном боже ааааав
The way editornim put a blushing thingy on both of soe' cheeks when sejun's scene came out AHHHH BUTTERFLIES
keşke altyazıyı açabilseydik bakarak anlamaya çalışıyorum anlayamadığımda telefondan türkçeye çeviriyorum skbfhkjs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"My heart's fluttering just watching it again." Still, we need that Seulki and Jinyoung end game! NETFLIX!!!!! Do your job!
Please all languae 🙏🏻🙏🏻
9:09 so cute
Nadine was the main character imo 💕
We need more of themmmm
I still feel why didn't they show in this that seulki was feeling insecure cuz of jinyoung popularity  that's why she cried and i feel seeing her cry jinyoung felt bad that he wasn't there for her and gave opportunity to jw but I think that seulki and jw are in a relationship right now
Soe and Sejun💓
I can't understand people why they don't like seulki like not even in this segment! You nuts?(disbelief)
Jinyoung really was the MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS SHOW. HE WAS TRULY THE ONE WHO BROUGHT SPICE TO THIS VERY BORING SHOW. I STUCK TILL THE END BECAUSE OF KIM JINYOUNG 🔥
i don't understand why y'all saying Seulki choose Jongwoo because of friendship or im misunderstanding your word 😀, we don't know anything..what we see from the show can't predict what happen to them after the show..well Seulki say that Jongwoo break the statement that Seulki would like to date a person that she like. Every time im seeing people watch dating show,some people really like to throw hate to that one person while you not there. 9 days literally not enough to getting know each others more better and they even at island...
Every time I hear "cute and sexy", I think about Jia
13:22 the way she look at him is so sweet
I just got out of my exams and hurried up to youtube. Seeing them comforts me so much I really hope to see them again in the near future
9:48 totally agree
If he tried he would lasted longer from Jin young to Sejun. This two men made the show entertaining. What if they cast this two from the beginning the girls would choose them.
Love to see Lee So E and Kim Se Jun working together in a drama .  Best couple in Inferno 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️👍
My favorite is seul-ki 💜
To be honest, Jinyoung saved the boring show, ever since he came to hell island ¡everything became more interesting!  thank you jinyoung for your hard work ❤️
At last I still in depressed 😭😭😭 my favorite 2 person didn't become couple🤧🤧🤧 I really like Jin young and seul ki 🤧🤧🤧
I want more reaction videos I wish there was not only 2
It will be nice to have another session with Sejun! I imagine it to be more fun.
oh my 9:11 so seul ki and jongwoo are together?? 9:18 seulki - jongwoo close your eyes lol so cute
i wish sejun was there😢
Jiyoungs reaction though 24:50
The title of this series should be renamed to " seul-ki and singles inferno season 2" since she had like 80% of the air time. Its like she sponsored the show.
ジニョンとスルギ、、、🥹💘
Soe and Hanbin 🥹💕
Ok but I kinda have a feeling that jongwoo and seulki are in a relationship coz she was aware that jw is going to watch the clip of the pool scene that’s why she asked if he’s gonna watch it and said “jongwoo close your eyes” and then jongwoo was kinda jealous whenever sk was with other guys and saying “glad they only held hands” and you wouldn’t say that if there’s nothing going on between you and your partner… idk maybe it’s just me
Nadine you are so pretty 😍❤
11:26 the part that everyone been waiting for lol. Sejun and Soe moments that changed the whole game damn! Sejun appears and he's a game changer.
Even here? Why is Sejeong is always being ignored?? There's no individual moments of her....
is there another part?
That wrestling match is really what change things for Jongwoo. I'm happy for him. ❤
11:24 Soee kiyowoo 😍😍😆
Soeun and Yoongjae are so unreal ❤ these two are what a beautiful relationship is like. They’re endgame I wouldn’t be surprised if they get married
*8:55** jungwoo: im glad they only held hand.*  HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAH
I hope there's also a video of them reacting to the paradise moments
本当に〜ジニョンが入ってくれてよかった！本当に 面白くなったのは、間違いない！！！最高でした！
More please 🙏🙏🙏😍 also so e and sejun special interview 🙏🙏
Seulki n jong woo really couple mode i think❤️
Single Inferno 2 : The Seulki Show
Yess, we back!! ❤
And here to Nadine  is not a lot on the show...i don't know why the fuck they are doing this
Nadine
I see Jin Young's humility.  he doesn't brag that seul ki likes him, he's very humble.  seul ki likes jin young people can clearly see the difference when she's with jin young she's like a girl in love and being loved.  She went to Joong Woo's side just because she was touched, she really likes jin Young
How about the final episode review? 😭😭
i need to know the song that was played after jongwoo got second place 😭
I love jinyoung. But i am really happy for jongwoo.   My favorite couple of this season though was for sure So-e and Sejun.
Netflix coloca legendas em português também
The way seulki said “jongwoo close your eyes “ really shows that they are still close and are probably in a relationship rn after the show
Jinyoung is so good looking. How about a show with him looking for love. Then we can see more of him. Netflix get on it!!
PART 3 WHEN??!!
Pretty sure seulki could’ve chosen jin young if it weren’t for the last day. He was too wishy washy and even told her he’s still not sure about her HAHAHAHA
More, we will see trillion eons more
WHERE IS SE JUUUNNNNN ?????
I hope there is also like this for ep9 & 10 with Complete cast please🙏  Soe♥️SeJun
Did anyone got be be a REAL couple though ?
I love Soeun and Yoongjae !
Why left out THE “JurrrasiC WwoRldd”
even all of them praise jong woo but i still think jinyoung is the best.. he stay calm and cool follow his heart and mind.. jong woo like a good friend who can listen to problem and stories.. jinyoung mysterious sometimes romantic and cute.. one thing seulki not feel towards jong woo is passion n chemistry.. what a lost
Seul Ki and Jinyoung are rl something :)) the others kept talking how Seul Ki “abnormal” behavior towards Jinyoung ❤❤ ^^
Where is Kim Se Jun I believe he was the most important.  What happen that we are not seeing So e and Se Jun   Is boring see constantly Ji Young and Suelki  really is boring  something must have happen.
7:59 I can't breatheeee jungwoooo💀😭
So e managed to pull out the best green flags as a friend ( Hanbin) and a man to date ( Se jun) from this show is amazing lol.
But honestly I don't see any of them dating. Most are just there for fame.
Lmfao I love how dongwoo came to Nadine’s defence saying how she’s good at sports and not to judge her by her petite body
jin young is the star of the show. He’s very charismatic and I understand why girls are all into him 😅 actually seul ki was drawn to him in a way that she could not even help. She would’ve chosen jy if he didn’t ruin the chance for himself 😅 I feel like he didn’t want her to choose him considering their different background.
Seulki's reaction to Nadine.... that glare 20:53
This show is not my type but i am get curious because I know Nadine as i used to be interested in Harvard this and that. But after watching the show, my favourite character is Se Jun. this guy is funny in a weird way 😂😂😂😂
i liked Seulki and Jinyoung together so much! I hope they still have a chance
I will miss you guys 😭
youngjae is so plain.. im so gald soe got sejun instead
Need more jin youung pleasee
Why its only 10 episodes i really will miss this show and the cast❤
🤣🤣Jong woo such a cry baby, so emotional
Nadine was talking so less here ! 🥲
I can see the Miss Korea Seo Eun here. She's like the host of this show, like she's full of wisdom and can confidently do every task thrown at her. A naturally bubbly & amazing person, She's a role model.
Bruh i need reaction to ep 9 &10 🤣
Will miss you guys 😭
Kinda disappointed for not giving soe and sejun more screentime on last ep.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
ahhh my top couples:  sejun & so-e jongwoo & seulki jinyoung & nadine yoongjae & seo eun 💗💗💗
i wanna see them reacting to the commentator's reaction too!
Sejun was the best guy this season, I fell in love with him from the first second and he was adorable the whole time. And, Jungwoo I was so glad he got his deserved ending, he's such a sweetheart, he was the charming, loyal baby.
I really think that seulki likes jinyoung more, i was rooting for them to be the endgame and was shocked when she picked jong woo, in my opinion he chosed jong woo because he felt bad for him for all his efforts. too bad i was rlly rooting for her and jinyoung
More again
No offense but i don’t understand why ppl r cheering up for a simp lol. It’s a scripted show. The pianist’s completely into the tattooed guy.
Kim jinyoung my fav...he is so charismatic and charming...loved him throughout the show...the chemistry between him and Seulki was amazing...🔥🔥 i hope they get together in the future 💕
9:11 yeah Seulki Jong woo is watching so we are 😂😂 the whole world is watching
So-e and sejun hope they will be together in real life
I'm waiting for So e and Se Jun! Where are they? 😀
Sejun and Soe ❤️❤️
Are seulki and jungwoo, so-e and sejun, seo eun and yoongjae are still together???
Soe and sejun i'm waiting for them
Jinyoung the best alpha male 👑❤ This show was going super boring until they brought Jinyoung. He is a very mature and charismatic guy, he honestly loved seulki. But Seul ki just couldn’t understand him as she was just focused on winning. I feel bad for Jong woo, he is a very sincere and innocent guy and Seul ki till date doesn’t loves him. He was always a backup plan for seulki. Seulki even now is fluttered and super interested in Jinyoung. Jong woo and seulki won’t last. She just chose him to win, that’s what makes me upset and feel bad about Jong woo.  It’s like Jong woo got Seul ki in the end but he lost.  Jinyoung didn’t get Seul ki but still won the whole season ❤️👑🇮🇳
Even all the cast is agreed that Sejun is sweet guy, wohooo kim sejuuuunnnn The time when he came just perfect to heal our So e our green flag man Kim Sejun is raising the standar so high📈📈
Girll the editing 😂 thry know what they are doing
nuuuu. part 3 pls.
Make more the  final we want to see it with them😁
Hanbin is so funny 😂 “there’s a reason why I’m in the middle”
Why is Sejun not here?
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Someone like this comment:  I still need the JY x ND collab to happen and then have them talk abt that If Only convo. Like, please. Hahaha.
Dying to know the couples who are still together .... And new couples (if formed after the show ) 🤭😗
Seul ki is a great person.. she really made a great choice by choosing JW… a guy who choosen only her from the very beginning.
The best boy really got the best girl. Se jun and So e. 🥳
Yoongjae was so quiet the whole interview 🥲
It's a petition for netflix to make a special content for Soe and Se Jun. Please, I need it! :")
i really like jungwo and sejun in this season. ‘boyfriend loyal material’  If sejun is at the beginning of the episode it might be more exciting.
31:10 So you mean there is no reaction video for the last 2 episodes?
Sejun sejun sejun..  Where is sejun?
sooo happy seulki and jongwoo ended up tgt they really do make such a good couple eueuueeu
Yoongjae is so boring and stiff, doesn't say a word bruh
Hope we’d get a video of them reviewing the final episodes!
Tbh I only felt the romantic vibe from Seo Eun and YJ, but I'm happy because they all seemed like such good friends! Especially when they talk about Sejun LOL. I hope they do keep in contact, seems like the s1 contestants arent that close :(
THEY'RE CUT JURASSIC WORLD OUT...
Great!! Will we have video that  the cast  watches final two episodes?  Look forward!
jong woo’s reactions 🥹🥹
i really wished sejun was there,. he was definitely my favorite
Love catcher in Bali also worth to watch tho. It has better thrilling vibes  compare to this. Imo.
I wish sejun was there, waiting for sejun youtube channel soon
I want to see more 😭  Why did Dongwoo suddenly sisterzoned Nadine and Nadine thought on it etc.
Are the couples still together?
PLS make them react to episodes 9 and 10.. That's where the real fun is. It would be nice to watch what they thought about before making their choice + last dates
Hanbin acting like hyeong to jongwoo whole this time is just adorable
Kim Han Bin: A chef who looks like a snack🤌🏼. I'm craving 🥴
If So E has braces she can be Bae Suzy and Chaewon twin 🤭 gurl has such an actress face
Is there will be part 3?
I feel bad for Sejeong because she didn’t have any love line, didn’t go to Paradise, and also only got few screen times. She’s being there just sit, watch, and hearing the other answering the questions feel so hurtful. I mean, she really deserved better 😢  I hope after this she will found her love one that can makes her happy.
“I look like a scientist who failed an experiment” - jinyoung Bruh this guy almost made me burst out laughing in the middle of the night 😂
bahkan di part ini pun gw ga kenyang ama screen time yoong jae anjir....ini knp sih netflix seulki ama algojo nya mulu elah...
I want to see sejun and soe interactions
Ss3
Soe and sejun have my heart ❤️✨
I respect Jin Young’s honesty and him being realistic regarding SEUL Ki : they are still my fav couple💜
Season 2 was sooooo much better that season 1 , the cast was really nice , they have remained friends even after the show!!!
I really like Sejun personality, I hope we will see him if they made the review of the final episodes.
So, Does someone know if the couples are still together, Or did they maybe after the show choose someone else from the cast?
Make it more for this last two episode reaction 🥰🥰
i love it how So E always stays true to herself and not feels embarrassed when confronting her inner feelings. If she keeps this unique attitude and maintains her original heart in her acting career, i believe So E will hit it big and be a great actress in the future. We'll see.
I wanted jinyoung and seulki and i still see that they're too good for each other 🥺💗
Swoon we need reaction to finale episodeeeeeee please!!! With sejun too!
How did seulki choose jong woo leaving jin young....🙄
Jinyoung didn’t even try to brag that seulki was obviously so into him but instead comforted jongwoo and back her up to dongwoo. He’s a great guy
✨Honestly, Singles inferno season 2 was one of the best reality show I have watched in a long time, not just on Netflix but in all OTT platforms. It was more enjoyable and involving compared to season 1. Unique casting and purity of the emotions made this season very impactful. Enriching and beautiful. All the participants had there different charms which further uplifted the show. ✨
My Name is now Jinyoungs Bussy 😂
I wish they show episode 9 and 10 as well!!
Unnie Shin Seul Ki❤️
Where is Sejun?
i want more yoongjae seoeun content😭❤️
i want more yoongjae seoeun content😭❤️
OMG…I was hoping to hear Jin Young’s impression of his time with Nadine…disappointing…
Perfect match seulki n jinyoung
Jinyoung is a natural leader.
are any of the couples still together???
About Seulki love-line & choice: The thing with Seulki is, her face can't lie. At all. She was visibly distressed & uncomfortable with Dong Woo, who, as we can see, wasn't on the same wavelength as her, as he tends to put pressure on her with all the questions.  With Jinyoung, ngl, there was some real infatuation going on there, both way. She kept giving him shy smiles and everything throughout their flirting moment. And tbh I would guess she (& other girls) was probably curious & attracted to Jinyoung because of this cool, kind of honest yet mysterious bad guy vibes he gave, something that's probably out of her usual friends circle. And different from the guys there.  Anyway. Seulki & Jong Woo though, even though she wasn't actually looking totally smitten with him during the days they spent there, at the very least I feel like their conversations make Seulki's own personality & characters actually shine. Rather than simply looking like a person who looks so in love and shy with a guy she flirts with throughout the week.  Whenever she was with Jong Woo, who really took his time and respected her boundaries, it made me thought how I wish I would see more of "this Seulki". Basically he kinda makes her character looking alive? They also found a common ground they can share outside in the future (aka the cafe shop AU), outside of the simple short-lived infatuation in the 10 days inferno bubble they lived in.  Which, also, definitely the reason why Jinyoung was being honest with her at the end & I respect him for thinking about the future even though the host said its not a marriage show but just a dating show.  And anyway, maybe, just maybe, if more of the Seulki, the one with different kind of emotions & characters appeared, maybe the hate train of people calling her boring for simply smiling and flirting with someone she simply found attractive won't be this much towards her.  Idk.  Cuz haters just gonna hate, especially when things didn't go their way, so.
I wanted and hoped So-e pick Yoong-jae for her paradise date. Unfortunately that didn't happened. But it would have been nice for them to at least talk as friends and maybe get some closure. I hope they are friends now at least and not be awkward around each other.
So e sejun best Cuple in these season ❤️
Where is sejun ?? 😢
It's all about seulki and jinyoung and Jongwoo. What about the others, I wanna know about the other couples
I was so happy for Jong-woo, he tried so hard since the very beginning and had to fight a 2-1 for his last chance going to paradise. I was really confiident though towards the end that Seulki would choose jinyoung, such a twist! I think JInyoung in the end was too popular for his own good, and it made Jong-woo and Seulki closer. Jong-woo is my fav!  Dong-woo i really didn't understand much though, it was more or less over since the first paradise he had with Seulki, he could've gotten better chances if he opened up to others imo.  Se-jun was great! would've been nice if he were there since the beginning!  Min-su kinda made things difficult for jinyoung to grow closer to seul-ki, pretty big game changer.  Im so happy for So-e to get a partner to leave inferno with, i was so sad as i was hoping for things to blossom early on.   Lots of other thoughts, but it was a great watch week to week! Been waiting since season 1 and it came out earlier than i expected^^ This season had one obvious couple and the two very popular participants, pretty insane
JY looks like a supervillain that you will root for and without him, island could have been a snooze fest.
it really sad, no one talk about sejeong. she's like a mix of suzy and kazuha with tanned skin, she has beautiful personality too. but nobody notice her.
Soeun really take cares of these girls, she is their mom. I love how she asked nadine about what she felt on the show and always listened them🥰🫶
how i wish sejun was in this interview 😭
Even in this interview it’s all about seulki 🙄
Please do another reunion!!!!
Yes finally thank you🙏
Sk is really pretty. Her sleepy eyes are unique and charming.
I want seulki to talk again with jin young 😢
Sejong be like us... Seeing cartoons doing their stuff! Crew should have atleast given a popcorn to her to enjoy other's drama
Yoongjae ngomongnya dikit bangetttt
please tell me they react to the last 2 ep as well!!!!
Please make interview with couple at the end of the show, so-e&sejun, youngjae&soeun, seulki&jongwoo 😭🥹🫶🏻🙏
all of their are likable and relatable in their own way. Seriously no hate, they have so much love for each other platonic or romantic!
so ep 9&10 reaction?
what is the title of the song at 27:45?
jongwoo was best i cheered for him!!
They are all so wholesome together lolol
i need moree
seulki and jinyoung parin :(((
THE SWOON I WANT MORE CONTENT 😭🥲
I WANT MOREEEE
It look like scripted from start to end
I don't like jongwoo he use paawa effect to the girl seulki...and they don't have chemistry together..
Part 3 us coming na of ep 9 and 10
Jerasicc worrld
Jongwoo and Seulki interview pleaseeeee❤❤❤
Jongwoo and Seulki interview pleaseeeee❤❤❤
Hello, how long will it take to Chinese Traditional? Both paragraphs of this tidbit are very interesting
Jinyoung is one of a kind lol sejun too😂 but yeah, jinyoung heated things up & he turned out to be such a fun & down to earth guy. He’s reasonable, honest, and thoughtful, yet also carefree & true to himself. Singles inferno was lucky to have him, & they did a great job of choosing jinyoung to be the first new islander🙌
Minus Sejun, but it's okay.   Sejun might have been in a deep sleep at that time.
padahal pengen mereka react scene soe sejun ga ditayangin jir
Will they review the last two eps as well?
wish we could see the reaction of Se-jun 😫
THIS IS THE BEST SEASON AND IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY <3 I LOVE ALL OF THE CASTS TOO
i like how seulgi feels bad for jongwoo when he watch seulgi and jinyoung's scene in the pool 😍
We need more unreleased clips of seo and sejun.
Nadine and So-e were my faves in the show. Nadine definitely has a strong impression and despite her fierce looks she's actually warm and approachable. For So-e it was more of a progression. She impressed me with her sensibility and kind personality.
I hope Jung woo fortune telling must come true😩🤣Him and seulki are soo cuteee
I want sejun 😭
Han-bin is the real man for me … He is the person I would really like to be surrounded with and eventually has the personality to fall in love with..And NADINE just naturally shines no matter what …. I love them both with no drama and matured behaviour. They are truly how people should be .
Still don’t understand why Se-jeong was overlooked by pretty much all the guys she was my fave
whipped for JY
Jinyoungggggggggggggggggg😭😭😭
the fact that seulki dont want jongwoo to see the pool of her and jinyoung.. ugh 😭❤️
We want 9-10 episodes reaction plzzzz😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
Jin Young 1.won that ring battle ,2. He was the best man there, and that dumb girl turned him down for joog woo? ,what a huge disappointment!! he made it interesting, without him this show is boring, 3. Time to interview more women Jin Young! UDT UDT UDT!!!
Aaaaaaaa😢compared to the  previous season I am more attached to all the cast of this season💙seulki and jinyoung not being the endgame  teared me into pieces😭but I was happy for So e and sejun,youngjae and Seo eun ❤Gonna miss all them aloooooottt❤❤really hope that we'll get to see them in future in other shows💙best of luck to all of them for their future
ITS KIM JIN-YOUNG SUPREMACYYY🔥
The caption: Jin Young's IMPACTFUL entrance 😁😂  His most fave word in describing every single date he went on at Paradise! 🤣
i like Nadine
whos the endgame of jinyoung ?
제발 진영이를 더 많이 볼 수 있게 해주세요😭😭😭😭😭😭
The chemistry btw seulki and jinjoung tho 😍😍
COULDNT YALL GIVE NADINE AND SEJONG SCREEN TIME EVEN WHEN REVIEWING MY GOD THIS AINT THE SEULKI SHOW WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT HER LOVE TRIANGLE BRUH AS IF THE SERIES ON NETFLIX WASNT LIMITING THEIR SCREEN TIME NOW THIS TOO
유일한 주인공 진영🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
❤️❤️❤️
It's okay bro Jinyoung. They had to force that ending. To appease their audience that wanted a drama like ending completely devoid of reality. True representation of a Sigma male unlike crybaby simp Jungwoo. You won in our hearts. Seulki also probably wanted to choose you but it's a show anyway.
잘생긴 진영🤌🏻🤌🏻❤
I just love Jinyoung's character, no matter what all of you say. He's so disarmingly honest that he ended up sabotaging his chances with Seulki. If only she could have looked at it differently. They were at cross-purposes. There were a lot of things that should have been said and should have been clarified that were not said, and thus created the impression that he was playing around and was duplicitous. He should have explained himself more LOL. Still team Jinyoung though. He was the star of the show in my eyes. Seulki made a confession to him the day before, and she should have stuck with it instead of wavering. She said she made a vow to herself to follow her heart, and she obviously didn't.
Moreof sejun and soe
Jinyoungg.. Handsome
This show was mainly interesting bcz of JY,  seeing lots of hate towards him recently which is totally not wanted! Anyways good entertainment hope for new season soon 😊
This season is much better than the last one the contestants seem to be so comfortable with each other ❤ also I’m expecting the couples to last in real life seulki and jungwoo from unrequited love to being couples and realising each other’s worth youngjae and seoeun with their smooth flow and mature relationship (lol they look like a married couple) soe and sejun and they’re cute kdrama i hope they also last after the show and good luck to all the other contestants in real life❤
Its Jinyoung MVP
i wanna know what's happening with the couples that went together.. are they together or what ahahah
Seulki best girl
If Sehoon and jiyeon from season 1 and jongwoo and seulki from season 2 end up together in real everyone will be blowned  away
Fiquei frustrada de novo,
I was waiting for the part where min su and Jin-young had a conversation at paradise so dat seulki will knw dat jin young has feelings only for her😓😑
JONGWOO IS HIM
wala jus reaction paper si Sejun 🤣🤣.. asa nas sejunnnnnnnnnn...
But sejun is not there......
aww jongwoo
Sejun is the real MVP here
the thing i don't appreciate about jinyoung is that, even though he was right to think about the future and his lack of ability to support her as a potential girlfriend at the time, he still tried pursuing seulki after saying that, when it should have been pretty clear the second he said it that there was no chance they would work out. and he had way more in common and more chemistry with nadine than with seulki - he did nadine so dirty... i was rooting for jongwoo with seulki from day one because he was never wishy washy with his feelings like that.
IM WAITING FOR THEIR REACTION TO SEULKI AND JINYOUNG IN POOL!!!
It's obvious Seulki was way more into Jinyoung than Jungwoo and its sad to see that JW saw the difference watching back. Jinyoung is so sweet to him to provide a different perspective to make him feel better. This honestly just shows Jinyoungs character . He really stayed true to himself and was very respectful
씨름 꿀잼 계속  여자 씨름 넣었음 좋겠다ㆍ🤣
Han bin,   he is hot 🔥
I love JY so much
Is it just me thinking that Jin Young shows interest in Se Jeong too? It's obviously not during the inferno, but after. He said, if he were to join Inferno since the beginning, he would choose Se Jeong based on first impression. There are also some of comments on Se Jeong that he mad during part 1 and part 2 of this interview.
I'm disappointed Seulki didn't follow her heart in the end, especially after telling him to follow his heart. She obviously liked Jinyoung and he liked her. They had great chemistry.
Hanbin, Sejun, Soe, Nadine are the best  ❤
Huaaaaaa
Catch Part 1 of the cast of SINGLE'S INFERNO 2 reviewing their show here: https://youtu.be/LF-jg_Ee81A 🥳
Does anyone know if the couples are still together?
I luv how So-e and Hanbin got to be best friends here
The way I was sure she would have picked jinyoung😳😳
Boss girl Nadine. She's my dream girl. Like I wanna be like her. Beautiful, talented and smart. Nadine I will become gay for you.
I wish Sejun was there
When will they do reaction of last 2 episodes????
So-e you're brave that's why I love you .
I would’ve drop the show if it wasn’t for jinyoung. I was waiting for the thrill that s1 gave me then Jinyoung, Sejun and So-e made this season much better than season 1 for me.
17:20 not everyone including the men scared to watch the wrestling match and you see Sejun going ‘oooh fight fight fight’ 😂
I am crying 😭😭😭😭😭 because of jong woo 😭😅
please turn on the subtitles, i need to understand what they say, thanks
I still think Seul ki will get together with Jin Young after the show.😂
We can see who are very suitable to reality shows here from this 2 parts. Too bad Sejun is not here.
Sejun ks definitely sleeping
Is there part 3?
so-e is really lucky to be liked by sejun
Jongwoo & Jinyoung both having opposite thoughts about how Seulki is with and the other, that’s how you see a competition
I miss them already 😢🥹🫶🏽❤️❤️
I feel people are misunderstanding jinyoung , he’s a free spirit and on many occasions he’s said it’s one of his drawbacks that he can’t express himself. The guy tried and he saw himself as unstable jobwise, he expressed a little bit of his insecurities about his future. Too bad suelki didn’t get it. It’s difficult for people to understand guys like him, but according to what I saw of him in the show I feel he’s honest, doesn’t make hasty decisions just cuz he’s insecure. Takes a stand when he needs to. Above all things he was worried about how he’d take care of his girl if he’s still unstable, that goes to show he thought things through seriously, not just during/for the show. He’s mature. Don’t be so hard on him viewers, he may not have a fabulous background or job at the moment (not forgetting he’s a former UDT,which itself is a huge achievement) he’s hardworking and determined with a tad bit of a goofy personality (if you watch his YouTube vlogs,you’ll know what I mean😂) anyway all the best Kim Jinyoung , you were amazing , and I know you’ll be successful. Guys, you just wait and watch he’s gonna make it big!! Through this show everyone saw you as a bad boy , but a few of us know that beneath all that hard exterior you’re all mush. I feel bad that you’re being misunderstood 😢 but you stay strong 💪 you’ve got a fan for life ❤ fighting !!!!! Well done 👍 and thank you for entertaining us!!!
Sejun and So E ❤
Jongwoo you're the best.
JINYOUNG X SEULKEE ❤>>>
Jinyoung is really honest and funny person at this show. I hope everything goes well for him.
Nadine’s accent when she speaks korean with the r/l is cute haha
진영의 솔직함이야말로 배려다
Jinyong love you❤🥰
Love them so much❤❤❤❤❤❤
Seulki and Jinyoung really had so much chemistry but I’m happy for her and Jongwoo, very cuute ❤
Jinyoung has a pure heart . I love him .
Yoong-jae & Seo-eun are heart fluttering, match made in heaven. It felt like their first interaction (he helped her put on the apron) was their engagement, their first one-on-one talk (with matching clothes) was their wedding, their first date in paradise was their honeymoon, and their 2nd date in paradise was their anniversary.
Jong Woo was the definition of Green 💚 Flag ✨ Happy Seulki choose HIM 😭 9:12 😂 The way Seulki said Jongwoo closed your eyes in her swimming pool scene 😭😂
20:58 he's way too honest 😂
Hanbin and soe "bestie" eyy  sejun and soe my best couple!!!
Where sejun??
I want to subtitle thai 🥹
This all scene 8:18 - 8:41  was so cringe to watch 🤣🤣🤣 you see Joong Woo didnt knew its happend, gosh i would be so embarassed at seul-ki place
nadine 😍
here after watching last two episodes ... .... seulki❤❤❤
I'm sure the girls are fans of the seulki and jongwoo couple,I don't understand why in most of their videos they put comments like "jinyoung was better" "they had more chemistry" well, the truth is, but from the first chapter jongwoo chose her and not as the other one who only confused her, In addition to the fact that he was there for her, but there are always people who are dissatisfied 🙊 Enjoy it, it's pure show the same.
i really want to see how sejun would react when he watch soe and hanbin in paradise
Was waiting for part 2 finally
I like the friendship of Hanbin & So-e
dongwoo ang jongwoo should ask jinyoung for a seucting lesson
I still want  nadine and jin young to be couple …❤😢😅
We need a more unreleased scene between Yoong Jae and Seo Eun. The only couple who have mutual feeling and radiates a mature vibes.
Nadine best girl😍
I clicked on this so fast 😂 Really enjoyed this season!
Will miss all of them 😭😭😭
Why is sejun not here 🥲🥲
Soyiii so beautiful here, her aura is different now
Talking about the girls. I really like the chemistry between Soeun and Nadine. Like, Soeun cares and adores Nadine a lot. It's cute.
I was desperately waiting for them to react to jinyoung and Nadine talking together sadly it's very short
still with seulki and jinyoung ^^
"IMPACT"Jinyoung 👏👏👏👏
AHHAHAHAHAHHAHA seulki's reaction to herself with jinyoung is like "was I really that into him?" LMAO
Ya pero Sejun el ganador del corazón de todas. Ese man está lleno de detalles que elevaron los estándares aún más.  True fact: Sejun is just a gentleman and you can't help falling in love with him. He's the standard. 🖤🥺
Cackling at Dong Woo face when Seulki got into the pool with Jinyoung hahaha
Song name please?
Jinyoung did look so in love with Seulki but unfortunately he doesn’t know how to express himself in words that it ended up giving her different signal. Jongwoo who showed sincerity and dedication had won her over. This show had been very entertaining, and i hope the cast would stay in touch with each other. Thank you swoon for bringing them together.
덱스 말하는게 진심 배려가 몸에 배인게 보인다 덱스는 사람 자체가 명품이다
i like jinyoung that he’s really thinking of seulki’s future, her being in school and doing what she wants. It’s like he really wanted to get ready before pursuing seulki. Such a matured way of thinking, he may be not the end game at the show. We don’t if they’re still getting to know more each other. Jinyoung wanted to be stable for seulki, and he wanted seulki to do whatever she wants before pursuing her. I like them alot !
Oh my god I was unconsciously rooting for jongwoo....I was so happy when seulki choose jongwoo.. The ending was so good.. And I don't think I need to say anything about other two couples..they were 💕
We need some unreleased seo-un and yoon jae moments!!!!
Nadine 😍
Sejun😢🤦
They showed all the boring parts like we wanted to see more of what happened behind the scenes on the dates. On Nadine 2 dates they only show parts when she was eating. I’m disappointed ☹️ 😒
"Jong woo, close your eyes" LMAO i think Seulki and Jongwoo are dating post-filming!!!
SeJun and SoE.... The last scene. Such fun romcom vibes 😭😭❤❤❤
FOREVER TEAM NADINE
Seul-ki really wanted ji young to come  to choose at end so she can reject him
Soe ❤❤❤❤
Glad seulki didn't choose Jinyoung. He's a red flag, very charming but indecisive and leads you on just to disappoint you in the end. As a teen I would have picked him but as a grown ass woman with experience, Jongwoo is the perfect guy.
Wee need sejun 😭😭😭😭
Jong Woo was so jealous at Seulki-Jinyoung scene 😭🤣
JY gigachad. Come to think of it JY never lied. Dex all the way.
The chemistry and friendship of this cast is everythinggg 😭😭
why I feel I'm watching a comedy show. It's so funny 🤣 Everyone loves Sejun a lot. Jinyoung reaction about the helicopter scene hahahaa. The scientist who failed an experiment jinyoung hahahaha. Then that scene with Seulki crying feels like they are gonna cry
A very unpopular opinion but i really like jinyoung's honesty. His answers to seulgi were actually realistic. There was very little chance of them falling in love within a week so he actually took time to think about the relationships seriously. He def thought too far ahead but i liked that he was honest. It gave mature and responsible vibes. Also, he changed the course of the entire series and made it interesting to watch.
🥰🥰
Yes please sejun and soe we need them together..
Just reading the comments first without watching yet as I'm still heartbroken with seulki and jinyoung not being the endgame...
ohemgee I'm never this early lmao what did Single's Inferno did to me 😂
Sejun and soe create their own kdrama in singles inferno ❤️❤️❤️
Jinyoung leh seulki molh khi😩madly in luv with them❤️
Let finished all my works please the temptation 😭
Sejun&Soe💞.....need to see more of them. More🙏🙏🙏🙏
😍
Jinyoung and Seulki❤
The impact nadineee had>>❤🥵
Sejun where are you ooo
They had us waiting for exactly 24 hours lol. but it was worth it
The waiting is over 🤗🤗
thank uuu
bad ending! should be jin young and seul ki! why seul ki? why?
Kim Jin young is real honest person ,happy to see there ✌️
I hope they all at least stay friends! And hopefully they will have season 3!
09:18 SK: Jongwoo, close your eyes (ahh soo cute lol)
i wish sejun was here. his reaction would've been hilarious ngl
Thanks for the update.
I clicked faster than Jin's rap
I came here so quick after getting the notification 😭😂
i wonder what it wouldve been like if they had this segment for the cast of single's inferno 1 too, to talk about what happened
i;ve never been this fast to click
💗💗💗💗
The desperation I have to watch this yet can't click play knowing that it's probably the last time we'll see them all together 😭
Without Jinyoung Appearance this series is boring, glad that JY is there🖤
hanbin I love u
i clicked so fast LMAO    petition to see sejun soon 😣
We look forward to more content like this. Keep up the good work.
