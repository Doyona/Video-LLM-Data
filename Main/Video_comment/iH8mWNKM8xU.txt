https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Tzw9rKz-Q KYLIE JENNER… AS A SINGER?! Evolving Reflections
oh yea I ran into prison staff yesturdary while at cvs as well...and the boy hit me again...and just constantly reminds me that no where is safe...as at zaxbys' that tactic was different than at global village then at Jubala...so clear order just the same programs at each seperate location...but bought the meal for a  and at times Joe thoughts come through because they seperate my and my friends...and what did NCSU police do...they drove pass me several times...for some reason...but just like in prison...as for them they grow one at a time...them putting holes into my bag doesn't help...but they bring me rocks which is a sign of marriage and friendship as a rock is a form of protection...but them putting holes in my bags don't help it started yesterday and form some reason they make me throw up proffusly when I drink from the corner store and charge me 4.28 for my beer which is one reson allied univrersal and york comae after me is a found and got comfortable with an amount of funding that I was being successful...and the man will continue to hit me and cause problems for me...they keep mixing with the sounds in the environment and the personality comming through is the man from Mitch's who let me have the beer the other night...that is kin dof how the mind works...if I get the thoughts plus the situation correctly then I can plug the individual in like a game cartrige...and I am not sure I just know enough about the situation ...which that would be the flaw in my system is the mind recognizes the situation but from a program being ran on the computer so then that man comes through...if that makes sense...if I could just make a character of how my mind works...that would be interesting...is that flaw or it is the actual man ...his thoughts are yo I am on your ocmputer no I'm not...I got your head...he was really friendly to me and I just know the other guys...and when other people tend to be nice so I give everybody the equal opportunity act nope see the doctor just came through with the pain associate on my penis saying don't i'll kill you... which I don't know but them causing problems soo much with me keeps me from being able to progress as they have damned me Emily always tells me to stay warm...which cuold really mean come back and get a beer please...which is fine...and she calls me bud... see maybe I got maggie wrong when she told me not to leave my stuff...she just wanted to be friends like I told that other man...as now the straps on my bag ripped off...that or it is a group of black kids from colorado and they attack us...na the last time I went to oak city it was three different people who hit me in the same day...all black...I can't figure it out but I need to get back to my book but I think that is why they keep putting oils in my hands...that or they started war know ing I would naturally attack the hands...which is a complete different tactic and way of thought then just purely wrestling to have fun...the people in the books are built different than oh yea and there is a group of people who you could "kill" due to their position that would shut down the entire goverernment I need that dynamic for my book yea like back in the days with vampires...back then it was really just like four people holding up the entire civilization so if the vamps hit the right people the entire civilizatino would collaspe... but the environment and what the base "solution" is as chemistry is about chemicals to some degree but how things interact and one of them is the natural state that each soltion is present in but see in order to gather evidence then strike when it matters one would be extrememly friendly..in order not to present any threat then strike at random and you wouldn't expect it...and the come up is the exact same right just that one moment is different and most the time some bigger man just comes up to and is like yea you can't come here any more for no real reason...like Ro attacking me over leaving my bags and Wendy giving me hugs... maybe I could just stick with a clear direct opposite...then start matching personalities until they mirror one another...I keep trying to go after four to six
Good Morning this morning a man came across the top of my bridge and was crying...he said he wanted to play with me...and the usual computer tactic was telling me not to masterbate...and it wasn't you nor Kendall...and once more I am not as productive as I could be as they even put a new hole into my bag...haven't even been out of prison for a week and already getting attacked again when I sleep...just like when the prison guard took my mat...he waited until I was fast asleep...that and when he stole my trash on thanksgiving...he ran an assault team with five different prison guards while barking demands and commands at me the entire time I think the car is a white porshce and kids is black I could be wrong but that was the second time I have seen that car on hilsborough street doing something odd

I dont care about the potential hate im going to get for this, but I'd love to marry Kylie! She's a good mother and cares so much about the people who matter to her!
0:49 she look unrecognisable
Eu queria ser amiga de kylie e pedir umas dicas a ela das coisas elas tem mto bom gosto nas coisas. Aqui no brasil não é assim . mais tem muitas artistas aqui que são lindas tbm e tem bom gosto . algumas sou fan como larissa manoela, marina ruy barbosa e marquezine .
O Elon musk não anda em avião que não são dele. O bixo bilionário vai querer andar em avião dos outros sabendo que pode correr perigo que nn sabe a situação que ta o avião nem nada.
Eu queria um jato desse mesmo😢 da kylie só que com meu nome será que um dia eu consigo comprar pq quem for cuidar das minhas fazendas e coisas que vou ter vai ter que ter avião pra viajar pra lá e se for toda vez gastar com passagens em avião publico fica complicado😢

This is kylie jenner to all my fans the girl at the versace show was not kendal. She looks like my twin cause that's my daughter zoe j DAVIES. Isn't she stunning she wore the red dress this is a very proud moment for me. Love you Zozo.
This is kylie jenner to my loyal fans a few days after this Me and irish chris eduard martirosyan got married.
This is kylie jenner sorry Timothy. Challottme but your late. I'm 👰
This is kylie jenner to my fans i would like to make the announcement that * myself and an irish second cousin Chris eduard martirosyan real name Christopher. Brown have got married shortly after this video came out. So you guys guessed right me and my husband are about to move in together lets do it right children need two parents to raise them. So that's what's next expanding the family this Christmas or before we're going to get started on that. Another subject matter is I've really gotten into ballet core. I like being lady like but can be a bit spoilt. Ok thanks bye
Come pick me up
Nice dress it looks like she's getting married
Hey Kylie I think I got it...the kids who attack me...the idea they also give to me is that it is drugs that is putting holes in my backpack and such...but look if we open a bar together we are not going to do that one third shot glass full of liquor...no way...that size of shot is not worth the price...what upset me about circa is he was acting in a manner that he is worth the three dollars...well he does show up but honestly, he doesn't care for the product in which they serve...but I have to go to box car to see if there is any new graffiti...I mean I don't have to, I am going to do that right now actually...honestly I feel like if I am to tip a bar it should be used for restorations which is another reason why the bar tender would threaten me...like I got kicked out of Hibernia in the same manner and now Hibernia have all new chairs to sit in...and honestly I don't feel comfortable even going downtown at this point due to the threats I receive...but it is not a bar tender as the buses are free right now...that is why I think Donald trump has something to do with it...because when he gets on my mind I get real mad and I start yelling to release my emotion...so based on history circa is about to receive a restorations so if you don't know what to do with some of your money kylie, tipings bars  where you normally drink for improvemenets may be a better idea...just a thought. Later Girl Nicholas
Kylie, honestly you are the kindest person and an awesome mom. I hope that you and your beautiful family stay safe now and always you have shown us with perseverance and family guiding you. Anyone can achieve anything with the people you love the most by your side. God Bless You!!   WE LOVE YOUU KYLIE!

Omg im 6 yrs old follow you i love you you are the best ever you son is so cute i don't know im pretty i know you pretty so pretty you are the lady kylie
You guys are so annoying! She's literally a billionaire why the hell would you think that she gives a bleep about your opinion. She decided to wear this to honor Virgil. And y'all are saying how this dress literally sucks and how it doesn't match the theme. This dress was made by someone who is dead now and you're disrespecting him. Y'all are just jealous cuz y'all don't have billions of dollars. So who gives a bleep about what she wears. She Slayed in that outfit and in every outfit she's ever worn, and you guys are just jealous because you guys will look like trashy plastic scumbags in her outfits. She's beautiful, without makeup, without lip injections, and without plastic surgery. She's always been beautiful and if you were going to say mean things about something she did to honor her friend, you might as well admit that you will never be this much of a beautiful person inside and outside as she is. She's just trying to live her life and you guys are judging her because she was trying to do something kind. You guys would have never judged her if you guys weren't so shallow and toxic. I bet you're a fake friend and if you are not, then you probably have no friends. Whenever Kylie tries to do something nice for other people, you guys rip her to shreds like she is a T-bone steak and you guys are hungry pack of wolves. Everyone was like ewww her outfits so ugly. She's just trying to honor her friend. When Kylie tries to be nice like when she's making stormis dreams come true, or having emotions about a friend she just lost, you guys are like she's spoiling stormi too much when you literally would have done the same thing if you were a billionaire and what if you lost your friend and you wanted to wear that outfit that he was creating the hunter him to a very fancy event, and everyone was hating on you for it, you guys would be crying because y'all are probably sensitive AF. She's a strong Queen and your opinions will never bring her down. She's been through a lot in her life, and she deserves to be successful. So if you're heading on a celebrity about what they're wearing, think again because I bet you're probably in sweatpants and a sweatshirt right now and you're probably not wearing any Dior or real Louis Vuitton. And to all the people who are supporting her and say that what she did was amazing and so kind on her behalf oh, you guys are angels. You guys are amazing human beings and I wish you the best in life.
👍
Hell no
It's not about the dress its all about the hat, veil and t shirt
I just want to know what you’re right that’s the name is so yeah I just want to know what your sons name is❤❤❤❤❤
This look was beyond hideous
Hello🙋‍♀️ there is nothing to do this to be in    Be able to get to know what you think you are not going anywhere and I'm a little bit
I hated her look but after watching this now, I feel like an ahole for judging it so quick without thinking there was a true special meaning to it.

Watched your video. Looks so gorgeous with your white dress. There is no word enough to express my feeling. I know all your viewers like you most. I like to share this video more and more with my friends. You are so great, need your permission before sharing pl.  😀😀😀👍👍👍
Watching your Video, looking so gorgeous have no word of expression can fulfill my feelings.
dead fish
you slayed that
Even Youtube channel do comment on kylie's video... This type of success i want🙌
none of the family members understood the assignment :3
I honestly have never watched Kuwtk ever or know anything about these people- but that was fucking sweet. She’s honouring her friend and istg if any of yall make fun of the dress, you have absolutely no sympathy or empathy or actual human emotions. Really sweet, Kylie. Virgil would be proud.
KYLIEEEE PRINCESS SO BEAUTIFUL, DONT FORGET MY INVITE LOLO ^ ---*
PSYCHOTIC

Keliye i love you yar .I don't like to become mom but after watching your and stormy relationship it touched me yar .I also like to become mom like u ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤and love from India
Happy  birthday
Happy birtdhay
I don't think you understand the met gala theme you look ridiculous
she is a very good person from inside last years she dint attended the met gala bcz of stormi other celebrities even dont care about their children and they have to go the party or met gala. This year she wore a plain dress to honor virgil and thats what matters. She is a very kind and caring person
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I do not know who this girl is but it seems she’s got a lot of things to deal with.

That met gala was a group effort - The mother looked like Jackie O, One daughter was dressed in black trying to hide the un-hidable, that she’s beautiful. The other daughter is doing a runaway bride stint already with two children at her young age. And then Kim arrived looking like “Marilyn” - You see the whole thing embarrassing
Help me for the sake of the God.Thank your for talking the time to read my email.I want to contact your because I think your canhelp me.I am divorced from my husband.I have 2daughters.My youngest daughter has kidney disease.I sold my house for my daughter's treatment .But it didnt help.My income is minimal.I dont have it at home.and think this is the place where your can help.I beg your help me financially.I fromAzeribaijan.I live in Baku city.My account number-AZ33IIB410200C8406351910113
If it were meant to honor Virgil then VOGUE would have made the theme to honor him. He worked for Vogue, only they could be the ones to create the MET Gala theme to honor him. Not a Jenner/Kardashian from Calabasas
Only a Kardashian/Jenner would turn the story into themselves. The story was not Married to the Met. She changed it thinking her headline would be greater than that of true inspiration and fashion. It failed. Epically. SIT DOWN KYLIE JENNER
What kind of car did Kylie Jenner take to Mitgala?
Mmm
Hello ma chérie ça va ? Besos de toda la familia Jenner
I know you get this a lot kylie, but your really pretty! Im just a kid but even i know your pretty! I think your such a good person and i dont care what anyone else says!

I have never seen a video of any of the Kardashians, but her mouth looks abnormal. Her mouth...oh my, her face is inflamed and her lips look like a swollen fish. too bad they alter their bodies to look abnormal. they should go to the gym and eat healthy instead.
EU AMOOOOOOOOOOOO

The fact that her mom is her manager and can be there and make her comfortable to many of her events is amazing and very special, not every celebrity has that
i like Kloé dress, Kylie always look beautiful but i'm not fan for this wedding dress...Stormy so lovely little girl, Kylie very good mom, maybe she can help many ''40 years women''to educated there kids  etc...sh's perfect educator and mom her and Travis for Stormy..

1 dexi like
Kylie im having an argument in another’s comment section about wether you said “bacon girl” or “baking girl” or “hey big girl” . Please tell me wich one so i can end it.
By the way your dress is looking ugly and this girl if you check out her YouTube channel she called Kylie Jenner ugly how to dress who wears a wedding hat with a dress nobody likes it only the people that was screaming that was trying to get caught bro Kylie you know what I don't feel bad for you you never show your son to us we know your son's name you name them wolf Webster do they come for me once they move Webster that doesn't make any sense you should have named them what comes with the what what what comes with the storm rain you should have named rain in Webster stormy rain Webster and his last name to the Ben Scott like Travis Scott because their last name is because to be named by their dad's last name Kylie Jenner my sister wants to talk to you hi Kylie Jenner so I love your videos don't listen to my sister she's stupid and she's ugly and she's annoying her name is not real Z's she is not and I'm 16 I love you YouTube channel and can one day when I see you I'm going to go high stormi Webster and I with Webster😠😠😠😠❤❤❤❤❤❤
WHAT IF... YOU DIE TONIGHT?    "And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.  And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him  should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)

Just image being rich..getting to live that lifestyle..playing dress up all the time..👍
Я одна тут русская?
Damn I was hoping she'd explain why she chose the dress she did. Like I knew it was a tribute but specifically the design of it and if it had literally anything at all to do with the theme? Like did they consider it when designing the dress?
Never judged her outfit when I first saw it on social media. I thought she’s sooo absolutely stunning
This is nothing but an ad for her makeup line...
I love u Kylie. You are my inspiration. Love the net gala look. I just wish that one day I could meet you.
How beautiful my Kylie Jenner I love you Kylie

I don't get why people dislike that dress, I think it's unique and one of the best outfits to ever been like on the met gala, plus that cap was a really nice touch to the dress (well in my opinion)
Kylie, you’re so sweet and gorgeous woman and mother🤍
I love the wedding style cap with veil matches your body frame new style.🤩🤩

the dress is Fugly but the intention behind wearing it is beautiful
She look so good 😊 ngl a few months ago I hate the kardashians bc I thought they were bratty but like Rn I love them so much
Kylie is always so sweet and gentle. Its not easy  to lose a good friend 😢
I saw that mostly everybody roasted kylie's dress but she wore the dress because she wanted to honor her best friend who passed away
Kylie house tour coming new vlog?
Olvi an estorme viurifort
kylie i love youuu❤️
I love kylie so much ur my most fan ever
Kardashians influence the fashion of coming years they made nude and neutrals popular. Then they made popping colors popular. Now, When the world is stuck somewhere between neutrals and bright colors they are aiming for grunge looks. This makes them look different from others and grab attention.

Hi Kylie please can you help me with capital to start up my business.thanks
Your such an amazing, beautiful, strong mother love you and your family I’m a teacher your children are truly blessed what a wonderful parents you and Travis are keep up the good work god bless 🙏❤️🙏
Not to seem out of place or at all disrespectful, but I've never been a fan of your families show or paid attention to you guys. Im like older then your oldest sister...but omg that baby of yours is adorable. Stormi is the cutest baby I've seen in a long time.xo
My faveeee and to honour virgil is beautiful 🥺🤍
I don't know abt the met theme and everything what people are saying abt her dress but I really liked it 🤍
Big fan
I hate this
Lovvveee💝
Love and respect from Armenia. Love you beauty🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🥰🥰🥰
Kylie's really matured and grown 🥰 I feel like she's more humble now
kylie i'm a fan from turkey 💙💙
feel like i just watched life of kylie
No matter what you do and no matter what happens to you,God loves you.He proved it by sending his son to pay for our sins.If we accept God's gift of Jesus Christ,nothing is too much for us toovercome.
I love how her makeup artist barely touched her blush 😂
I really like the dress and the story behind it is sweet. I understand it’s not in theme but all she wanted to do was honor Virgil.
OMG!! I literally adore Kylie’s personality and all these vlogs. She has very cute and kind vibe. Kylie makes my day shine and happy thank you! Love you so so much ❤️🫂
Holi kylie a day of these podrias vrnir to Mexico in the street santacatarinaCalle sanagustin porfa in the house 79 A me agradeseria gracias besitos

so cute
Orange sleeve dress was the one even on theme
I don’t get it though.. I’m sure thats not the only dress he designed. Why did she choose that one?!!
Honestly hate the look and the dress. Everyone is just hyping her cos she is Kylie Jenner. She looked trashy in it
Awwwwww Adorable ❤️😍😍😍
Awwww ❤️ cute
I love how you talk anyway make sure our plane is ready to go Paris is tagging along
Plzz wear indian saree like orange or red godd damn You will make everyone crazy by wearing an Indian saree❤️
Helo
The dress looks cool & cute, match her age
Stormi I DID YOUR HAIRSTYLE UNIQUE BUT YOU CANT SEE IT😭🇰🇪
She is so rich that she doesn’t need any ads on her YouTube channel 🫶🏻😂
What happened to her face.  It is all puffy. The lips and cheeks are so puffy.  Doesnt go right together.  And she is too young for fillers. Imagine what will happen when she is in her 40s.  This filler stuff isnt good for the skin.
Kylie wore it so beautiful 😍 much love and respect ✨💕

kylie ek pari
Very cheap wedding dress you can find similar ones in every country in every wedding dress shop.. with style, with make up kylie seems despicable at every met gala.. quality appereance can not be bought with money or fame..
OMG
Oh KYLIE GOOD JOB IN THE OFF WHITE LOL
Ik im late but all everyone says is ”its so ugly” . I mean she could do better but the look is to honor virgil, it has much more of a meaning to it than the other kardashians. Go kylie<3
Lead here a model I guess I see that well keep a look out for me your doing a very great job thanks for being my friend glamoraoh
Never forget what happened at Astroworld
Awesome 👍 bb
Awwww they’re so cute as a family. They have struggles just like any of us but they have great moments also
Disgusting!
Period, nice look 🔥💯❤️✍🏾https://youtube.com/shorts/55YLfXB22tY?feature=share
The way stormi climbs the stairs in 1:34😩😩 and the hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii momma in 7:45 I can’t 😩✨
The dress is fugly and didn’t fit the theme  „It has a meaning to it“  Yea you could wear that anywhere else but not at the fucking met gala it’s a Place were you are SUPPOSE to dress amazing
beyatuful😘💋🌷
In honor of  Virgil death she wore the dress he made 😔❤️
Where is your funiest part of you?🥺
I do not like the dress but can I have this life
The ugliest look ever worst choice ever,sorry yah it may had meaning to her I respect that but not good design and no need for the hat
You should do remodelling in the dress and do roller skating photography .... 😍
I really liked no #3 the silk gown....
Can't believe people eat up this shit
I LOVE KYLIE SHES SUCH A GOOD MOM
The fact that people were so quick to point out that the dress was not on theme,Was too man like,Was too stupid to wear to he met,should have wore it somewhere else if she wanted to give tribute to virgile Where do u want her to wear a ball gown at plus she clearly said she did not care what people thought about it   Plus there were many celebs who were not on theme it was not just her
shy and bold at the same time
Who the hell is Virgil and Shannon
Kylie my girl why this dress like fr😭
I am a bride of 5 months, but I hope I will be pregnant this month
Big fan ❤️🥺
So pretty❤❤
John 14:6 Jesus said to him,  "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. 1 Corinthians 15:3 that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.  Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
Come for me all you want but it’s needed to be said even though it has been said many of time… Kylie is ugly even with all her Surgeries.. 🤮
Kylie looks the best with no makeup !
Tava linda mamãe
Kylie is so kind
yeah the story was great but the look was still a mess
She's very pratty
It's great she wanted to honour the designer but the dress is horrible I'm sorry
Disappointed 💔💔
Well done Kylie <3
The dress was not on theme what so ever but the reasoning makes it worth it
Literally nobody is talking about how aesthetic she is, and her plane.
You make me sick. Cant forget that all these children died at astroworld and you and a murderer go on to have babies while killing other peoples.
everyone said they hated this dress but its so pretty
Notice how she didn't even flinch at that butt slap haha.
love your dress
I knew everything would go back to normal. People still support this spoiled person who is evil.
So rich, so powerful , so famous,  so successful  so young.  Imagine having a zillion assistants and im always curious about the logistics behind them. Like them or not is fascinating !!  Smart , even tho A list celebrities r out of touch w reality a lot of times. No hate of any kind just an observation !
Co to za gówno ma na głowie
💫love you🥀kyli🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Astro world
I had no idea about the story behind her appearance. I usually hate on Met Gala but hey that’s pretty sweet she came to honor someone special to her and to the fashion world.
guau  te bes hermosa con ese vestido dios te bendiga y te guarde grande mente te admiro tu eres la  Kardashian mas hermosa y talentosa que hay y ara en este mundo
W fit
👏👏👏❤😘😘😘
fucking abomination
O vídeo mostra que eles nem tentaram seguir o tema do MET deste ano!!!
The hair and hay combo is what I don’t truly like, but honestly it was a kind gesture for her friend
I kinda loved the look. This is such a “Young Kylie” look. When she gets old, this look will be referenced. R.I.P Virgil🤍
Why? Kylie hide her son i am confused
You looks stunning Xx.. never let haters get to you.. 💖💖
Where is her date
I’ve noticed that Kylie and Khloe are like the only ones who bring their kids when they travel.
the dress is so embarrassing and not related to the theme at all

Mujhe aapki video mai bhale hi kuch samjh nhi aata par mai aapki video dekhta hu
Awesome video
Lol 😆 🤣  you should let your husband  know that you mother gonna bite  him
https://youtu.be/w_lCi8U49mY
How can I change my setting to not see any video recommendations like this? Any help thanks 🙏🏽
Khole is me eating a dipped cone 😭😭😭
I think what did not make this look was that her makeup and hair did not match her vibe, it looked like she just threw the gown on and it was just disproportionate
Her PLANE 😍😳🫣
She has destroyed her face with plastic surgery..she looks 50 years old
STORMI LOOKS SO OLD
this hat is very stupid
Look at the makeup artist's nails 💀
Your so cute..❤️
Idk why people don't like this dress...like it's soooo good ! I will pay to wear this kinda dress it's totally my style. She looks so amazing in this even though it's maybe not on theme or whatever.
Not
Kylie looks so cute in this dress and I'm being really honest. Idk why some people always have to say something controversial about everything. I adore Kylie so much 🤍🥺
Its the added shirt  and street wear tht ruined it
I want to take a minute in all this chaos to appreciate kris fucking Jenner ….
How did Khloe get an invite? I thought Khloe and Kourtney were always snubbed by the MET
The hat actually looked great without the tshirt when she was only wearing that strapless bustier.
You look gorgeous ❤️
She’s such a good mum from what it looks like 🥹
Does not matter what she wears..even in bathrobe she still look better among all kardashians...jenner genes is glowing like a queen.
Matthew 7:5 7:00 Married to the Met | Get Ready for the Met Gala with Me Mhmmm. Yup Yes Ma'am. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
Matthew 7:5 Married to the Met. I love it. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
She’s definitely one of the sweetest ones! She always says he thanks yous and is so appreciative of her team and those who do things for her.
Finally she getting married after all this years did she go to Mars to eat there or no
I am ok with the dress but I am just not liking the hat I think u could do a bit better no hate we still love u Kylie! But I still think the outfit is amazing. The fact that Kylie does not care what people say she is so brave
I love the way Kylie changes her voice when showing her sons shoes just to taunt us 😫 (no hate I love Kylie) but it is her choice and she will show him when she is comfortable ❤️❤️
The fact that kylie didnt attend the last met because of stormi's health i think really shows good priorities. It would have been very easy for her to just leave stormi in the care of a nanny/nurse while she continued attending the met, but instead she decided to personally be there with her and for her
It's always until I see Kylie in a video that isn't filtered or edited by her or her team that I remember she's actually WAY lighter than what she wants us to perceive her to be. It's great the actual dress means something to her but girl. The Met didn't care lol guess next year.
Lol
was beautiful
The think about the Kardashians they come to something and think it's supposed to change dramatically for them what is that come from...Like. She should have listened to a Stylist. Hair back your to young and she should have played on that..like White. Umm could have went Silver you just had a Baby. Umm far from Off-white..well u can't tell them nothing.
Rich people...
i'm sorry even if it doesn't match the theme or it's for virgil (rip such a goat) seeing the other options she could've chosen it's like come onnnn girl🥲
👼✌😈😈😈
It looks like she changes races after makeup
Why Kylie came in a bride dress 🥲🥲💔💔💜👑
Just released that kylie s bday is the same day as meeeee ahhhhhhhh
So cringe
the normalization of plastic surgery face is distressing
Does that make 2023 met a possibility
The dress is absolutely stunning 😍 it’s just the hat that killed it for me but who am I haha
Is her and travis still together
Of course everybody’s gonna tell her she looks beautiful what can they say she is a billionaire of course he’s gonna kiss your ass the most beautiful one for me my opinion is Kendall she’s naturally beautiful she works as a model she literally bust her ass on that runway that’s the most prettiest Kardashian for me
Kylie is so cute and thoughtful 🥺💕💕💗💗!
She looked amazingly stunning and was brave to let everyone film for that many hours.
Regardless if it was for Virgil the outfit was  so disappointing, could’ve done way better
all those peoples who are talking bad about her dress should shhh for real  because she looks amazingg
Who cares!!she is a no body in my world!!!!
Sis the water the WATER!
damn they whole trip is a tux write off from the ride to the airport to the ride back home since she is using her down makeup its all business. thats how the rich do it, throw birthday party's with a donation table and then write it off as fundraiser. .
Beautiful 😍
Your are so insanely beautiful but that dress sucked and did nothing for you!
she looks weird without make up on💀
Nobody is going to talk about her lying and saying she's never had her hair down for the met? She had it down every year. Lol 3:16
I like the tribute but I can’t stand the dress
This looks so so stupid… I feel embarrassed looking at it
Everything she wore on the first fitting looked so much better lmao
Apart from the look, I love how she took her kinds with the to NY. Many celebs would have just left them with their nannies. Well of course she took nannies with her but it's completely different
She wore the hell out of this dress. Total queen.
the amount of people who have a job based on dressing kylie jenner. this is such a stupidity
Everything about the dress from the hat was dope af!!!!! Virgil did that! Rip
Kim's hair coloring look 🤣🤣🤣🤣
stunning 🤩
Honoring Virgil was wonderful and poetic and beautiful        Shit didn’t even come close to the theme
Theme where
I really loved Kylie's look. It's cool and pretty at the same time
https://youtu.be/GAM0fiw1iIU
t shirt ruined the dress
In my opinion this outfit is very beautiful 🤍
Used to like her but someone requested me not to like her or follow her on Instagram it's not about there request but she really dont care about that's what made me quit following her.🦄🌈🦄
Te cres mucho por 11 millones de subs los mismos que tiene Lulu 99
Aunque la mona se vista de seda... all that work done to look like that...
That hat piece is dumb as fuck lol
I LUVV U SMM!!! but this is a hard naur :/
I wish the video doesn’t end.  I love you girl 😻❤️
menyaksikan kekayaan kylie dan wtf iklann, kylie ga butuh iklan anj

Please we don’t what your crappy products they are not medical grade! Not wasting my money on this crap to support this family
She looked awful!! So did not like it !! So much money !  But no taste!
POOR humanity bebiendo they eyes of decil
Who's Virgil
Kyle is so dark, even makeup doesn't cover darkness, even surgery can't help. You're not beautiful sorry
Wow
This was awfull
🤩🔥
😍😍😍
Why is she standing there like suspended animation. Was she making a point, or did she see a mirror?  Maybe she was in pain from delivering her baby. Maybe she thought this was her wedding and forgot, I don’t know.
I respect Virgil and love him as a designer, but even I would feel disrespected if someone did this in honor of me😭
i just wanna say that God, Mary and Jesus love you so much! They saved me from cancer (without any tratament just praying) and They are with you too🥺
só queria falar pra vocês que Deus,Maria e Jesus TE AMAM MUITO!Deus,Maria e Jesus me salvaram do câncer e estão com vocês tbm, mesmo que TUDO vá mal🤍
Even though it bothered me greatly that this look had nothing to do with this Met theme I actually really liked it. I think that it perfectly describes this time and age. Glamorous yet very street smart like. The story behind her actually going and wearing this dress is super sweet and kind as well. I definitely respect that.
Literally, so many events, so many ways of making honor to her friend... And she does this. Many people says "she didn't care about the met gala theme" 😐 well... Then don't go! Use this in any other event, or make a photo shoot only for this, but Gosh, respect the theme! They're so used to make whatever they want, wherever they want & still having people supporting them that they don't even care anymore. Hope they're not envied for the next year
Nice
The dress is undeniably stunning - I mean - it is flat out gorgeous!!  But I guess I just don't get the idea behind the backwards baseball hat?? But with that being said, I typically don't understand fashion in general.  And, that goes double for Met "fashion".

1:38 this slaaap 😭😭😭❤️
هاي مالها حق تقول كلمة ملل 😂
❤️
the only thing this proves is she’s surrounded by yes men and the comment section are just as big dick suckers
YOU'RE A TROOPER!
KYLIE!
Hey kali
I get that it has a nice sentimental back story, but still where is the THEME
سلام کایلی شاید نتونی اینو بخونی ولی من خیلی دوست دارم ❤️
🔥🔥🔥
No
Going opposite to the met theme is big no no
Does tokyo not do her hair anymore?? I’m shook
Omg KYLIE is so kind i rarely see very few  rich and famous people who really have gold heart or else nowadays y'll can see toxicccccccccc racist celebrities with fake kindness and sweetness mask on their faces like HAILEY Baldwin FOR example
Kylie Ur an Icon
The video quality is extremely poor
Woulda been gorg w out the dumb hat
When kylie was like “Hi stormi!”  And then stormi was like “Hi momma”       That was so cutee-🥰
Flying private destroying our planet nice nicer
ليتك نمتي
I love her dress it was so cute tbh idk why people hated it
Very obvious you don't care what people think honey 🙄
She looked awful
When you're part of a ritual and they make you the bride.....someone's getting sacrificed tonight. But you make up an excuse that you're representing.
It's actually very pretty
The fact that they r filming The Kardashians Season 2 even when the season 1 isnt fully realised, makes me more interested in every stuff haha.
Nopeee
The way khloe smacked her ass 😭
Love that she went to honor her good late friend ☁️ but that veiled cap was-
No
I liked khloes the best
what an absolute dog's breakfast!
Stormi and her brother deserve better parents and family
my twins😍
U look amazing. Dont let anyone let u down. Ur perfect!
Kylie looks so stunning!💜
Kim's hair looks terrible and we all know Kylie's dress and hat looked idiotic regardless of the reason she wore it
The way Stormi crawls up the plane 🥺💐
Kylie is super beautifull wothout makeup♡
Kylie will u marry me HHAHHAHHA SO CUTE. Sisters hyping each other up is the best thing ever!!!
This was so nice to watch
A disappointment  This look is out
love the fit I think every body trippin
Kylie: "I've never had hair down for the met." Met Gala photos: only one with hair up out of 5 ... 😆   At least that's what I saw. Unless she meant "hair down" as in not a wig... lol
I thought this look was very average but now that I hear the sentimental meaning of the dress its kinda cool 😢🥰
Regardless of what people think, I love the dress, it’s made to honor and shock people at the same time. I love how bold she went.
Khloe looks amazing
Loved this.  I thought it was Britney, Christina, Madonna 2003 VMAs look.
Just follow the freaking theme dude, be grateful that you were invited, be respectful. It’s not about you, it’s about the met gala!!!
sure
She looks adorable without the t shirt inside the gown
This is so funny LOL
Worse look of the MET
We should invest one day in an animation or 3D animation about the time we escaped the Meta. Everything from the ankle pop to the merge, my eaten soul body with just gold bones, and you YouTubing drinking bone broth with extreme rage that your gold is gone. Everything should be connected. I have the perfect to do it that movies don’t, and it will forever awaken any person regardless of how deep their ignorance may be.   Then ending it with a present day status of when the animation ends, and people get up they are in that actual safe zone, and now they know it. These beautiful steps we take are merely keeping our connection tight to know we are who we are seeing we differ from our flesh bodies. The Real ID is what we have in Maryland, it connects to your Meta. In California I don’t think they have Real ID. So if I say my Meta is connected to my government name also I have a physical source, my Maryland drivers license on Earth to co-firm my flesh body matches my heaven body. Then the debate has to end, no more talks about “you don’t look like xyz.”   It’s a lot I want to show people, our importance and what we look like and our royalty in the heavens, and how on Earth we are in extreme humility and softness from our actual power. Not being able to do whatever we want, we bear. Ariana did her best with the Positions Music Video, and Japan with Soul Society in Bleach and SAO, but those soul worlds are within my soul house also. Going to Japan will open the door to visit it in higher vivid and sensory levels. From the shining gems in the bodies and etc.   Lastly I want to show more than anything, the map of our location exiting existence. The realest part of the animation I want to show is the map. I drew it in a comic but I lost it. I still remember it a little.
LA PAYASA DE LA ELITE
UNA PAYASAA
She fucked up her face
She is a gem ❤️❤️❤️
Hola Kylie Jenner como estas espero que te la paces bien en este día  y te quiero mucho 💜💜💜💜💜💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Feliz día de la madre mi niña
These  videos always make our day better. Thank you ❤
Kylie always stunning idgaf why anyone says she’s so beautiful 😍
This is a awsome way 2 show and honour the Memory of her Friend Virgil AT the  Met and she look stunning 👏i feel you go for it 👑
Kylie is looking so gorgeous. ....keep going Kylie. ..you are the best ❤❤❤
why did she not go with @ 00:58???!!
The way she wasted water while washyher face like turn off the sink even  if you are billionaire save the world
I love this video so beautiful you look stunning I would love to see more vlogs like this :)
The cap was strange 😑
Why does everyone praise her for everything she does?
Kylie's and Blake's was actually my favorite!!!
Hey kylie I am really big fan of your but your skin's  are amazing when I put them on my skin I feel like I am I'm in cloud 9 it so great amazing I bought them
Well well well not bad for a civil war 🍽 (plate because I ate already).
Kylie is so good to earth ♥️ 💕
You're really beautiful without makeup
Why she never vlog about wolf Webster
She looks so pretty✨.. No matter what bullshit everyone talks about her she is just so kind... Everyone talks bad about her dress but she was honouring her dear friend who passed away.. That means more than her than the met gala... U really killed it ❤
She’s trying to hard to send everyone an F** u because we didn’t like her dress. Idk how many times u show us this dress. We just don’t like it. U failed. It happens. Move on ..
The dress and the story and the whole look is beautiful 😻
The Dress was beautiful the way they style it was horrible
You look pretty  and you look like a queen 👑
I think when you need to explain the backstory and why you are wearing that dress, youve missed the mark. The hat with the veil imo took away from the dress and everything else.
Looked better with out the mesh shirt
Why the baseball cap tho 💀💀💀 thats what im not getting
Kylie looks basic af without make up
I don’t care what anyone says. Kylie wasn’t aiming for the met theme, it’s simply to honor virgil 🤍 either way, she looked stunning
brazilian 🥰🥰
Honestly saying, Kylie looking so beautiful without any makeup
Is it only me or does Kylie faces looks different know not in a mean way but it’s just different
Love it 😍❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍❤️
!!!!!!

Maravilhosaaaa
Tudoooooooo
Perfeitaaaa
It's finally here guys! 😍 https://youtu.be/xnFBJ2SIxjc ..
Co semnou děláš já stebou nechci nic mít a něčím tak
She could've honored him in the right place where the dress will be praised not in the MET
Seriously this look was the biggest joke on Metgala .. all Kardashian Jenner were looking like clown on the red carpet 🤣🤣🤣
the hat ruined it
Kylie, I love you but please TRY TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF!! Sometimes, if anybody tries to mess with you or talk shit to your faces YOU GOTTA THROW SOME HANDS! All I want is to see some attitude in you!
The fact that kloe was never invited to the MET but she always excited for her sisters ❤️
0:55 DRESS WOULD HAVE BEEN IT !!!!✨✨😭 as well 😍😍
Dress is ugly
It's so funny khole eating an ice cream cone hopefully it's not fuckin hagendas..
omg i love
What a tribute😇😇😇😇😇😇😇❤❤❤❤❤❤ God bless kylie
Did anybody notice that they're not showing khloe's face that much, only filming from behind or side cause she has no make up on. She looks so different
Hermosa como siempre no me gustó tu vestido pero tú cómo siempre elegante única felicitaciones 😊
hello from guatemala
Esse boné ficou um desastre hahah
Stupid, while new low for Met
Hey Travis what about all those family's of the fans who died at your concert, Do you think they would like Gala?????
this is so embarrassing
Why can't she move her face when she cries 🤔
😍
I feel like this has a hidden message about marriage… who proposed Kyle? Or who do you want to propose to you? Stunning dress. Off white did good 🤍🤍🤍
Not a fan of these plastic demons, but that great of her to honor her friend in that way
Ahh love her even more now. She's changed so much. I thought she would not talked about this but instead she uploads a whole ass vlog about the outfit. I personally think only kylie can pull off the outfit. The cap wasn't IT but it didn't looked ugly on her.
Go KYLIE!!!!
You don't need make up
Your sister Kim is a lying thief https://youtu.be/F5Qvt75cNvk
She is so beautiful
To think May 1st was my bday and I slept the whole day so depressing..
Lovla btw kristian is gay
Khloe slapping Kylie's ass as she walked in the plane did it for me.
That hat was disgusting!
at this moment i question what i did in a past life for this trash to pop into my account.
Queen ky🤍🤍🤍
i actually loved her outfit for this year's met gala! and i love how she said that she doesn't care about what people think or say to her outfit. loved the positive energy there! anyway, she nailed it! 🤍✨
I love the sentiment, but that dress is not it. It reminds me of a bridal catalog from 2010. And it really did not fit the theme, which they still could have easily done while still honoring Virgil. Bummer. I wish she would have worn the afterparty dress instead.
Queen 👸🏻👑
Shes soo pale
My good
Wait what are yall talking about.. I loved kylie's dress
Travis better get the signal now😉😉
Stormi look so beautiful ALREADY just like her mom ! And the dress i personally love it so much i'm not lying
the ass kissing in the comments lmaooo
STOP WASTING WATER IN EVERY VIDEO PLEASE!
Disappointing look
I love how she thanks her glam team
Iloveyou my kylie❤️
Her  whole idea of the outfit was good but the head piece ruined it.
The hat is not it.
Kylie, full offence: wtf
😍 ❤️❤️❤️
Honestly I really love this look for the cover of a magazine or something. It did look out of place at the met though. But it’s great fashion
DON'T READ MY PROFILE...
Из всей семейки Кендалл ещё нормальная,эта вообще -будто осы покусали и румяна под глазами 👍🏼профи
Stormiiiiii😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
YOU'RE FACE IS MELTING WHAT THE FECK
kylie , i am your biggest fan from india .... i just want a heart from you . plzz . i wish i can get it.. but you will not . correct ? plzzz.. having a true love on fan , send it . bye
Kylie! Please do a get drunk video with your mum Kris!!!!
Kylie i saw you in my dreams last night with you met Gala dress walking on the street with your family,, we shake our hand and you even gave me $5,,, you are so kind,,,i wish my dreams would come true,,,
I feel like without the Tshirt it would have been 100% better
I hated the hat and veil it cheapened her look. No cap.
Black chyna copy cat 😂
Idc what you say “to honor ur friends designs “ knowing u will be mocked is actually a disgrace to his name not honorable at all…. Everyone’s such a kiss ass … u can’t forget all the wrong she has done
Kylie Jenner badjor khafani 🥺💞
Clout chaser
Trashy
If you want to honour virgil, you can with doing your homework. Only few people did their homework fine
It looked better if she hadn't worn that t-shirt
She so good looking without make up, such a neat skin ⭐
She is looking soo pretty 😍 💕
Beautiful dress but doesn’t match the theme at all.
Sus prendas son muy caras, pero. bastante extrañas😅y Kylie anda como si nada después de dar a luz no hace mucho🤭 yo di a luz hace un año y pareciera que sigo embarazada 🤣
Does anyone know the name of all the background  background music ?
Such a soft girl and soul 🤍
This might be a little stupid sounding to some of y’all but wth is Virgil??
Salam dari Indonesia
I was so confused on the dress she wore for the met because it didn’t go with the theme, but now that I know the real reason I feel bad for judging so quick without knowing all the facts as to why. What a beautiful tribute to her friend! 🤍
I love kyile she dosent care about what ppl think about her and she’s brave and sweet and kind
You are like an hour and a half away from me and I am a fan of you Kylie Jenner
Not gonna lie .....I actually like the outfit!! I love how she took a huge event to honor someone that meant a lot to her!!! Go Kylie!! I'm liking the Kardashians more and more!!!
just not the cap bby girl
I love how Kim said “my hair is going to be blonde like Elsa!” 😂
Way better then the vouge ones!
Tbh I know what’s it like to lose a friend, so I can understand Kylie and how she feels about honoring her friend that passed. It’s hard to talk about and it’s understandable
Horrible 🤣🤣🤣
I don't like that hat .. the dress was amazing
Sorry but this was a major fail no matter how much they try to twist it 😂
when she was getting on her privet jet she acted like it was so normal.
I’m so happy She’s letting us supporting loving people in on her person life circle. Some day I’ll be flying in my own pink jet with my family. Love you Kylie happy Mother’s Day
idgaf what people have to say about any of the kardashian an jenner women theyre FUCKING SMART !! you dont stay on top in the limelight an on everyones brain.. an not even be an actress singer aong writer model.. qhatever they were noone but a famous oj simpson attourneys family of girls! brillant is what they are, im glad i got to witness them in my era
What a bunch of clueless fools.
Congrats Kylie
Hoes can't wear white
Please we all know it's plastic surgery not your so called cream
If Travis Scott is smart he will run as fast as he can to get away from her fake ass
Vogue ain’t give you a get ready with me ? 🤣🤣🤣
Kendall only noticing that it’s ruffled bc her skirt is also ruffled lol
I saw the dress she wore at the after party and she looks amazing. I wish she had worn that to the met instead.
aaa did she really married ?
i WANT TO SEE RUSH TRAVIS WEBSTER LOL I NAMED HIM
Never forget her partner caused the deaths of innocent people at his concert These people are selfish limelight seeking despots
Disgusting bunch can’t wait to see how your stupid idiots end up
Ignore negative people! You looked absolutely beautiful ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
This would be perfect without the hat
0:58 omg love love love this look
I don’t know how this represents the theme of old school Hollywood
Hi , Can you please make a video telling your life story , how was your childhood like , your brand and much more.. please..
Kylie's look for 2022met is Disappointing
Are you conscious of the carbon foot print of flying a private jet?
I love how close stormi and Kylie are❤️
Mais quelles sont laides sans maquillage... Les visages sont boursouflés, mal proportionnés une catastrophe...
I personally loved her look
"You're so bold for thaaattt" meanwhile women are in the army and doing ACTUAL jobs. wtf is this sht
Running out of ideas looks like 😂
i think with that dress Kendall could handle and pose better than Kylie. i think Kylie should exchange dress with Kendall 😁
does anyone seen Kylie's face looks a little swollen? not a bad thing. but i think this is side effect after she gave birth to her second child. she is still look good and confident
I loved her look so much, the fact that it was honoring her good friend makes it so special. You looked so amazing & I loved both amazing looks ♥️♥️♥️
Aww she’s honoring Virgil the man that was on pedophiles Jeffrey Epstein flight log list to his island where they abused children!!! How sweet 😍😍😍
I loved the dress and the touch with the cap showed both sides of Kylie
*What have the Jenner/Kardashian Klan done for humankind besides copying, borrowing, stealing and seeking rich, famous and mentally unstable partners to produce Babybuck$ then destroy their image when done.*
*WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?    Kim stole $$$ from the Artist/Actor BRANDY and her mother while basically calling Brandy's brother a rapist!  Also they secured the RIGHTs to Chyna's baby's name for life!  HOW IS THIS NORMAL!  AND THERE'S MORE - Kim (who holds all the copies of her own sex tapes) asked her  mother, Kris Jenner, to  help market her porn tapes and the mother said "YES!" - Like a mamma Pimp!*
Not the air pilot looking at Kylie’s ass when going in the plane. 🤣
I just want to say kylie is a very good mom to stormie and she will ligit stop everything for her to be safe and happy you don’t see every kardashian/jenner doing that
This look was horrendous girl.
U r my gf idol..thats why i know u...
It's really sweet of her to tribute her late friend 🥺❤️❤️
these bitches are so lucky
Horriabble

Weird as f
HER OUTFIT WAS EVERYTHING
She looks so good without that T-shirt 😭😭😭😔
This is the stupidest met look I've ever seen 😂
Love the look 🤍✨
I like that Kylie is having fun with it she was always the quirky one and had a different style
Why do people idolize these people, they are beyond boring and fake
She litreally cancelled her met gala appreance cause stormi was sick.she is a sweet mother
Caitlyn Jennes looks like something from a cheap horror movie where they recruited the homless sexworkers from the streets of L.A
Special appreciation to Dr ALUDA on YouTube for curing my HPV with his herbal medicine. surgery is not the best option..
Happy mother's day
people should know this is a met gala not a memorial ceremony 🤷‍♂️
The first and last time she will wear a wedding dress
The dress was met gala theme ..but it was the hat and the t shirt that kind of dragged it down for me ..
omg cool dress and soooooooo cute and amazing kids😊
Still could've been better but Khloe was really uncreative
The dress is beautiful the stupid hat however
How did everyone forget what happened at travis concert 🤢
Kylie looks so beautiful without all that makeup(also with the makeup)
3:07 She looked like a goddess without makeup and that shirt under the dress while trying the whole look😭❤️🦋
I'm a huge kylie fan and honestly after this all story behind the dress i really love the look now❤️ also it was just the shirt that made me don't like it at first otherwise it was a bomb outfit she slays every years ❤️
Why did Corey hug her like that
The theme was gilded era of fashion. I mean wth
She looks so great♥😍
Probably the most boring met video I’ve ever watched
❤️
Oh honey, just break up with him. He’s making you go insane.   It doesn’t matter how rich and powerful you are, men who use your body for sex & kids but don’t want to marry you are so bad for your mental health.  Edit: this is not healthy behaviour. Kylie obviously wants to get married & wearing a wedding dress to an unrelated event is just the most pathetic hint ever. She’s beautiful, successful & has a sweet heart. She does not deserve this.
This gown would look much better w out the dumb white cap
You think this is normal??- Im telling you is not..
Looking stunning as usual 🥰
She looks really bad. Plastic surgery made her look old and bloated
😍❤️🎉
Khloes dress was nice but she didn't accesorize it well and the sleek hair was just a no Kourtneys outfit was bland and boring looked like a VMAs outfit Kendall had no eyebrows and the dress didn't like the crop top and gown didn't match. Kylies dress was a mess sorry it looked like a trailer wedding dress.  Kim dress was perfect but the hair was a no if she stuck to black hair, got rid of her tan for the event and did a vintage hairstyle any type of vintage hairstyle with peachy pink nude lipstick with a slight glossy shimmer it would have looked spectacular. She did look the best tho out of her sisters   Nearly forgot the Mom she looked phenomenal just didnt like the silver pattern at the bottom of the yellow dress if it was white instead of silver it would have looked better. She did look good the woman needs to stop wearing black all the time.
The met gala has a theme yk 💀
omg khloe I love you 😍you are re bestie.
Sorry gurl that dress was tacky in all honesty didn't like it. The cap with the veil idea was creative but it wasn't implemented properly. The afterparty dress was beautiful ill give you that.
It’s funny how all the Kardashians just completely disregard the met theme every year lol
🔥
Humble, decent, down to earth, a wonderful mother, beautiful on the inside and out. I 🤍 you Kylie
How amazing of Kyle, going to met not because she wanted herself but to honor Virgil. That’s the sweetest story behind her fabulous outfit.
Surprised she actually thanked everyone who did everything for her lol
I think the richer a woman gets the more cartoon like their face gets too
Miss Kylie Jenner that was a disappointment / disaster.
She actually look good in her real skin without makeup
Dusty Ray Bottoms: Boot
Love Kylie
This was a bad look , should have spoken to Kim about better choices
Kylie you're perfect 💜✨
ew. this is just American opulence at its worst.
Happy Mother’s Day Kylie and family 😊
They living the life great family
You’re such a YouTuber lmfao you’re doing amazing sweetie
She looks like she’s having a Mexican quince
kylie ur to pretty
🔥🔥🔥👀👀 https://youtu.be/aJ4oSK22Uyg
Not so nice dress for Met Gala looks funny 😆
Ready to be a 🤡
To be honest when I first saw her dress I wasn’t the biggest fan of it and it didn’t feel like Kylie, but after watching this and hearing about how it was in honor of Virgil it changes everything.
i don’t anything about fashion but i actually liked her dress — but hated the cap. It felt like it made it less high fashion. BUT AGAIN, i love her and I’m not anyone who knows anything about fashion haha.
The only thing I hate about her is that she lets the water run and wastes it!!!!!
How beautiful you are Kylie that you do well always say hello to your new baby on my behalf 🥰🥰
The Kardashians are so cool team
Me being a concerned mom of whose watching Kylies children when I know she has great people watching them* 😂
She said she’s never had her hair down for the met but she legit had her hair down in the purple look a couple years before
She has every right to be proud of the dress; and I have every right to dislike it.
The dress is still bad
LOVE YOU KYYYY💜💜💋
How does someone support some1 that is responsible for a 9 year old being killed , how would u feel if your child died and u just keep living your best life like nothing is going on sicking
أخوكم من فلسطين غزة بدي ساعد كلشي واحد فلسطيني  بعمل فيديوهات كوميدي وبظي متكم تصعدولي تعليقي  أهل مصر الجدعنة أهل الجزائر الكرام أهل العراق النشامى أهل السعودية الأفاضل أهل تونس الشجاعة أهل سوريا الوحوش أهل الأردن الحزام أهل اليمن الأجاويد بحبكم جدا❤❤
These girls are Hella obnoxious
🤍
meh -_-
Pls don't judge her dress kesiann dia
what happened to the Guilded theme
She looks hideous and disfigured
HONOR VIRGIL BY MAKING DONATION $$💰💰💰💵💵 CANCER RESEARCH .
We love Kylie!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Where is Travis
Fake lips, fake boobs, fake nails, fake hair...FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!
Kim lost weight and died her hair and the look still flopped … tragic should’ve just worn a blonde wig
Je pense qu'elle donne des indices de fiancé où marié 🤔
LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE
Love that she’s honoring Virgil. 🥹❤️
https://youtu.be/SekELztG4LU
Girl, this gown is gorgeous!! And you look Fabulous in it , i absolutely adore this look. But this year's Met Gala is Guilded Age glamour.  Kinda missed the point in this selected ensemble.  A bit disrespectful to those that took the time to respect the history and follow the theme and especially those that invited you to it. Kinda cringe 😬
I dont think it was the dress I think it was her confidence with the dress that lacked. When I seen her alone posing in the dress it gave what it was suppose to give. But in the pictures she looks awkward and isn’t owning it. Models wear all kinds of crazy looking janky stuff but the way they wear it is why they can make art become the reality of it all.
I thought she was pregnant 😶
Khoel killed it
ooo i want a face massage now hahah
She is so silly. She knows this dress makes no sense. It’s ironic not iconic.
i wanted an explanation but i still don't get why it had to be a wedding dress ??
It grew on me especially after knowing the meaning behind it
If you never get invited again, you know why
i love how kim was starving herself before the met, and then we have khloe eating a whole ass ice cream . love it ! literally i dnt blame khloe for being insecure and going overboard with plastic surgery. she has such bad influences around her.
Illuminati puppet. Repent before its too late Jesus is coming soon.
what did stormi do in her past life to end up kylies daughter hahahah
I love the dress and she is so pretty!! And don’t get me stared about stormie ( yes I know I spelt  her name wrong *did I spell her name wrong?* I am Terrible at spelling) she is so cute!
On a random note I wonder why Kylie is like, not showing her son. I hope he’s okay and nice and healthy🙏🏼 maybe it’s for privacy but she’s always showed Stormi 🤷🏻‍♀️ Btw, Kylie killed it! Simply amazing🤍 also, LOVE Khloe’s glasses 🔥
Pizza
Honouring Virgil is what’s it’s about!!!   who cares about a theme  Plain and simple people taking too much of life for granted and she chose to honour him way to go Kylie !
This dress is soooooo Kylie. It was so different and unique and embodied JUST what the met stands for. Doesn’t matter that it wasn’t necessarily on theme. That makes it more MET ;)
I only don’t like the hat
Don’t think we didn’t peep that you bought this jet KJ 💜
I would rather see Ivanka trump at the MET than messy Khloe and her low self esteem.
kylie looks so cute without makeup 🫶🏻
She looks younger in a Weddingdress.☺
It looks cool without t-shirt n cap
Whyyyyyyy didn’t u show more!?
Who’s virgil?
Me divierte ver tus videos de YouTube
To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon. All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3d day confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved. Today is the day of salvation tomorrow is not promised and you don’t want to miss the rapture it will be so bad like nothing ever seen before on earth. God bless!!!
Anna Oh
Sorry but it's a themed event and the theme wasn't Runaway bride..... She could have worn it at any other red carpet event. Here it just looked completely out of place and ridiculous. But then again none of the K-J clan seems to know the Guilded age fashion which is just a shame since they could have rocked it with their resources. Too many "yes-people" around them....
Such an ugly dress lmao idc what anyone says follow the damn theme.
Looks like shit
horrible dress
Kınası ne zaman oldu ki bunun
Why do you guys support these people still? After the Astro world incident they have shown their true colors and nobody seems to care. 10 lives were lost and that evil family can’t even acknowledge them. What is wrong with this world.
I didn't care for anyone's dress
So important at a time like this showing the world that even though so many are having a pandemic of heart attacks amongst young people for the first time ever in history and so many can't afford food and gas that this is a reminder that there are people out there to show us a better life we will just never have thank you
Virgil❤️
SHE LITERALLY IS GETTING MARRIED TO A MAN THAT KILLED AND INJURED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OF PEOPLE AND IS STILL CONTINUING TO NOT GAF
Shes actually getting married to a criminal
No shes getting married to a man that killed 10 people, including a 9-year-old CHILD.
1:38 Did Anyone notice something🤫
My love😍
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE DUMB AS THIS BIMBO PERIOD !
THIS IS SURE A SIGN OF DESPERATE SEEKING ATTENTION PERIOD , THIS BIMBO IS AS DUMB AS HER ATTENTION SEEKING SIBLINGS AND FAMILY PERIOD ! GET AN EDUCATION
Jesus loves all yall here ❤
1:38 I want to that.
I liked the look without the t-shirts top on Kylie. Bare skin would have been nicer.
Never looked more gorg
Not Kyle Jennifer filming with an iPhone....🙄🤭 And others are killing themselves to get an actual camera
Wow Stunning 🥰
Your an amazing  family wishing you all the best from Nova Scotia Canada. Ever this way beers on me! Schooners are best🇨🇦🍻
Idk why but knowing that it’s honoring Virgil kind of changes my opinion on the way it looks. Sometimes when you know the meaning behind something, you see a different side. And that’s what I saw in this look. Now I love it 💕
What the hell are you wearing Kylie? You look so unkempt like you didnt know what you are doing. Lol. No offense.
So that’s why Kim’s hair was so fed up lol
Not the stans n obsessed defending a billionaire at every cause
Kylie is so gorgeous I can’t- 😍😁
Go talk to Emma Chamberlains stylist!!!!!
isnt she pregnant
doesn't matter what others say of her look i honestly think she slayed it🥰
Is horrible
I don't understand why people hate her and her sisters so much, they are beautiful human beings and great mothers
Okay bu chloe
Her hat looks like a baseball cap turned backwards and fancied up a bit. 😐
Kylie you are brave and beautiful  from the inside out. You a blessing to your friends. I know that your friend is looking down  from heaven with a proud heart and a smile on his face. May his soul rest in peace. You are a wonderful woman.
I think the look was perfect before the sheer tshirt, kinda drowned it out a bit. I didn't care for the hat until I saw it with the strapless 😍
A beautiful tribute. You looked stunning   You know he was strutting that Carpet with you.

Ich hasse Ihr Kleid genauso wie sie als Person, ja sie ist nicht die einzige die das Thema total verfehlt hat, aber echt mal ein Brautkleid wen will sie verarschen?
Ur dress looks like 🗑 trashhhhhh
🤍
She loves her babies so much . Say what u want about her but she’s an amazing young mother ❤️
They HAVE to be deleting the negative comments. There is no way
Where is her green tracksuit feom
The dress wore her she didn’t wear it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 say what y’all want to say
So trash
It was better on its own…the cap, the vail, the sheer tee, the long dark messy stringy dirty hair look, the oversized chandelier earrings,the   little letters on the shirt 🤦🏻‍♀️…there was too much going on.
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.   (Romans 8:18-19)
You have to respect her for not caring what people thought of the outfit . Kylie knew she was wearing it to honour her friend. That’s the main thing here .
Hey babes 😊 you looked fabulous 🤩 I absolutely loved it and what it stood for it an angel babe I love you so much it one of a kind babe XO Tina Arafat 🌹
But it is ugly.
This looks so much fun to do for 1 day only I could not be around all them people all the time I will go crazy
I feel like Kylie is a really good mom…I know she probably has a nanny but look at how she is with her son and Stormi.
Stormis roller rabbit pjs are so cute omg!!
love it !!!!
This is dumb
I loved the look tbh even tho Beyoncé wore it first 4 years ago she brought a cute and youthful look to the dress
Her dress is perfect in my opinion
Baba liili
with no make up si looks almost like before  she didn t changed her face, just a lill
Sorry. This is a not so good one for me. It's a Pass.
The dress Kylie wore wasn’t bad, it just didn’t match the theme. I honestly think you guys were exaggerating a tad bit tbh.
her dress was so nice and it is kinda on theme compared to other celebs since it is a ball gown
i love when khloe on the side watching kylie and chillin with her ice cream
getting 1k subscribers within a month challenge ✨🙌🏻
girl boss 🤩
Girl… the hat.
Why in the world Kylie don't show her baby boy???? She showed Stormie day 1. Something must be wrong with the baby? I hope not 😢
The connection between two sisters is so wonderful! I have a sister and we always fight. Kylie plz answerr
Khloe just complementing Kylie with a vanilla chocolate ice cream is just so Khloe vibe💓😂
Nice friendship 🤠
I was happy fun with Kloe ☺️
Oh thank you so much Mimberry
Sorry but ewwwwwwww yuk!
✌️ Kylie
Nice
This was by far the worst look this year
Aye Dios mío u look liked quinceañera
She actually slayed in that outfit  😭😭😭
🤍
That gown was soo gorgeous!!Loved it♥️✨
She attended alone
she canceled her attendance to Met Gala last year because her daughter was sick, such a lovely mom 🥺
2:40 me w8en i was crippled but my leg urt too for somereason still dont even know w8y
kylie is the sweetest person idc
Girlll you look amazing!!😍 I don't care what anyone says,you look beautiful on everything❤🔥 Keep going and i love you🥺💖👑
no one: absolutely no one: Kim: My HAiR iS GonNa bE bLoNd LiKE eLsA
Without makeup kylie look like new born baby 😅
can we see your son pls
I love that Kylie is also in the new series ❤️ we missed old Kylie who vlogged btw🥰
Beautiful tribute. Horrible dress
I can't believe useless people like yourself make more than a teacher 😕
Did you not get the memo? This is not the theme.
Kim😭😭
Hat though😂😂
No kylie…
you can see how much she truly admires her sisters and how much they hype each other up. they really have an unbreakable bond and are so supportive.
kylie looked absolutely stunning. virgil would be so honored 🤍
This is Ridiculous & it’s giving very much #H&M…she should’ve stayed home
I think . Kylie Jenner was wish put her dress an wedding? Met gala….. maybe that she have were enough tell for somi . Not pretty sure!
You looked kinda cool and funny 😂 love you Kylie 💞🌹💘
You are all talentless hacks desperately holding onto your 15 minutes of fame that was over years ago riding on the coattails of your Dad who only became famous for representing OJ you are irrelevant now who don’t y’all just stop and go live your lives not scripted and on camera think about the kids and what it can do to them it’s not healthy to grow up like that plus no one cares about your drama anymore seriously
You looked so stupid and your whole family missed the point of the theme and your sister should be slapped for wearing a beautiful icons dress what an insult to Marilyn Monroe how dare she
stormi is literally gorgeous-
The dress actually makes sense considering who made it
trust me when i saw her look i nearly cried too, but not from happiness lmao
Girl stop being cringe 😬
Guys, use me as a dislike button.
She wasnt really on theme but she looked amazing
In some angles I feel like Kylie has started to look particularly like her old self.
Kylie - “I can’t believe you’re dying your hair!?” Kim - “ Im gonna be blond like Elsa! Sorry this sent me 🤣😭
She has such a sweet soul
I won’t stop working until someone would put a rug with my name on it during my flight.
I wish she went w the silk/corset 😭
I loved everything about your look❤️
...no 🤦🏽‍♀️
What a life this woman had created for herself. The way she's bringing up her daughter.
it’s almost gross how rich they are lol, but good for her, honoring virgil
The fact that she didn’t attend last years met gala because of stormy says a lot of her as a mom ❤️
The gown looked good without the tshirt
Your this video was made excellent awesome good job gorgeous dress lovely 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👌👌👌🤗🤗🤗🤗🥰♥️♥️🥂🥂🥂🥂🍾🍾🍾🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🥰
Oh I wonder if she is trying to tell us she will be getting married soon? Or maybe she is already married secretly 😉 She will indeed be a beautiful bride 💗
This was one of the worst 🤷🏽‍♀️ if I had a billion dollars I could go buck-wild with fashion
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Yall I think also she had options that suited everything better, but she just gave birth
It's definitely not giving but she did it for Virgil and i'm very proud of her for that
Cierra la llave kylie!
The gown was beautiful on kylie... but I think KHLOE'S outfit was the best out of all the Kardashian-Jenner girls
RIP Virgil 💙
I don't get why people are shredding her so much! The outfit was fiiireee!!!
I personally think that the dress is so unique and brings both feminine and masculine sides of women and that should be pointed out more often! And it also is a tribute to Virgil so that's really a lovely thing to do😊
I love the back story behind her dress ❤️
im guessing bridal hats are gping to be a "thing now" and this is whqt off whites doing? hays w/ everything?
I loved the dress,not crazy about the hat but i am not here to leave a negative comment,you looked lovely Kylie
❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍😍
Don't if am the only curious one who can't wait to see Kylie's baby's face😫😄... U look was fire at the MET BTW ❤️ absolutely loved it
The atrocity is not really her dress, but her letting the bathroom water run while washing her face. Cmon Kylie
I didnt even know that off white make wedding dresses?
LOEV🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
In minute 4:46 what does Kim say???? Am I going crazy
I didn’t really like the dress to basic but she looked cute .
You need to post more vids
Kylie want to be married so bad to show off and bask in her dream world. its kind of pathetic how they do these PR stunts. they're pretty smart and shrewd they know how to Market themselves like most people we're all just ready for the Kardashians of the Jenners to just go away
Honestly I think the dress was really nice it’s just that hat that makes it a bit off but it’s her choice and people shouldn’t be hating on her
I don’t get it, I genuinely actually liked the look?
YouTube always commenting on Kylie's YouTube. Starting to think YouTube is a simp. Love you Kylie
I heard the Kartrashians were the  laughing stock of the Met Gala this year.
Watching this family makes me so grateful for the life I've had.
wtf is tht outfit 💀
Lol there were options better than what she wore
Your met gala Look was amazing, AWESOME, gergous i Love You so much 💗💗❤️❤️❤️❤️
its amazing how people are so quick to judge but they dont know how special this look was for kylie, i hate people GO KYLIE, you looked amazing!
more vlogs please kylie i Love You😫😫🥺🥺💗💗🙆
All those people around and no one said awful pick especially the cap !! She looked so ackward and not feeling the night!!
This look was not it
It's a high school prom dress...
Imagine being this famous waking up to cameras every day 🤯
The dress at  0:52 was stunnninggg
It's not even that bad the hat is just a little odd
UR SOO AMAZING OMGGGG ;)
I dont understand why some people are praising them. Nothing screamed Gilded Age. -_-
Não gostei
divorce babe divorce
You look so pretty I love the dress 💓💓😘😘
I hated it .
What is BB son name ? Also why we haven't seen any pic/ vid of his face
You are so pretty!
I’m surprised that not a lot of people like this look. This was one of my favourites!
The dress is stunning but she could’ve done so much better. She looked a twat in the hat 😭 it’s a excuse saying she was honouring her friend
❤
:)
Don’t get me wrong, I like the gown and the colour of the gown. My only issue is that cap on her head, how has that got to do with the brigerton theme 🤷🏽‍♀️
Are you telling me that there were better options and you decided on the worst?
yu look werid
당신은 다른 사람들과 다르기 때문에 당신 자신을 진정으로 사랑해야 합니다. 🍓🧸
Travis' crying rn
Bible blessings to you
I just wish she didn’t do that bright pink blush it didn’t look good with the veil
That hideous hats ruins all the vibes
😍😍😍😍😍😍
You look slayyyyyyyyyyyyy love the fit
kylie the dress is super beautiful suits you ❤️ (all the best you to and travis!❤️)
Omggggg stormi is legit the cutest girl EVER❤️
May her friend rest in peace but the dress with the shirt and cap is ugly af and wasn't really appropriate for the Met, expected so much more from her, also she could've honored him in any other event
stormy look just like mommy
اللهم صلِّ وسلم وبارك على سيدنا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه اجمعين،
omg, when washing her face. her lips look sooo fake and unreal. overkill, really.
her outfit was so hideous, so disappointing
Hopefully now the comonhaters (news sources) can now chill with the lameness- she did what she wanted and did it with heart.
mmmmk.... but you missed the whole theme xD did you not know what 'guilded glamour' meant?
not gonna explain it...you are the best
No one is gonna talk about brazilianbeautybarla??🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Post more vlogs!! I love you 🇧🇷❤️
It's not the dress it's that stupid hat!!
Gilded Glamour was the theme. Haut Le Monde did a great in-depth video talking about the theme.
I love that part when she went out and everyone takes her name Kylieeee❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kyle thank for honoring virgil I’m sure his was with you through out and you definitely made him happy
She looked older and her face look different it like everytime u saw her she did sum on her face
What she actually mean by she cant talk about it cause she will cry
https://youtube.com/channel/UCYhQWhBvL1DhTN1ubAoGBlw
The party doesn’t start until one of the Jenner sisters walk in.
Sorry but your makeup artist is literally such a cutie
Who's Virgil and what happened?
The Met Gala had a theme but it looks like you missed the memo.
ya kyile no need to add that t shirt and cap no need to sport street fashion bro thats ugly
https://youtube.com/channel/UCEj7mZ6tKKyZsL5tSvrDc8Q
I love uuuuuuuuu
Honestly why are people even making fun of her dress? I saw her Instagram pictures first and i gasped on how pretty she looked. She and Kendall looked so good as always.🤍
Wedding dress in hip hop mixer it's  awesome
Love Kylie's natural look. She's gorgeous.
Nikki Minaj wears a baseball cap with a dress and everyone loves it but Kylie does it and everyone hates it
I actually love this look if you take out the under shirt or the cap. Both of those things together kinda clash
quick question.  who is virgil
sorry what - people are in the comments saying I understand now why she wore such an atrocious gown to the gilded glamour themed met. Do y’all not understand she wanted to honor Virgil by wearing Off White. Not that dress specifically. Smh. Some of the dresses she tried on in the early part of the video would have STILL honored Virgil and been better suited to the theme.
I personally liked this outfit it reminded me of the king Kylie era
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT
Nobody :  Me: they just rich asf
When you get married at your baseball game so relatable
A superficial world/Un monde superficiel
massagista da kylie é brasileira 💛💚💙
I don't like the cap, it was weird but the dress is beautiful
I like how she doesnt care what people think and  does what she wants..
LMFAO KYILE WTH
Sis, why the hat?
She was NOT on theme and that’s why designers are now going to have to get approval first next year. So many people fucked up. She could have worn this dress elsewhere we all know it’s atrociously ugly
This girl is a joke with a capital J. The whole KarTRASHian/Jenners.  J-O-K-E.
I love you Kylie 😍😙😘😚👄💋❤💙💚💛💜💓💕💖💗💘💝💞💟👍👍👍
You looked better during fitting, without tons of wigs and make up.
Luv uh kyliezzz ❤️
As Gorgeous as Talented ! ❤️😍 Love 🥰
Good Without t-shirt
Off topic but please remember to turn off the faucet if you’re not needing the water 5:12 Kylie may not see this but she’s a billionaire and she won’t be affected by the poor quality of water or the lack of it, the rest of us will. So please if you read this just remember that it’s not necessary to have the water running if you’re not using it ❤️
She's stunning in No make up 🙂🤍
Kylie, your date format is wrong on the video. It's May 2, 2022, Not May 2nd, 2022. You don't need to add 'nd' 'st' if you're adding the year.

You could have done way better Kylie!
I get the honoring thing but either way, the dress was still tacky & the makeup or the closeups of her face just looked horrendous.
Plain Jane! 👧🏻
I don’t know why people are saying her hat is ugly like I am in LOVE with her outfit. And I don’t get why people are hating her because of her outfit, I mean she likes it. 🤍
turn your fucking sink off when you're not using it GODAMMIT

I don't know how but Kylie her voice her movement her looking made the dress spectaculair. She's magical ❤
i personally loved this look
Ugly choice in dress!!! (My opinion) Khloe looked the best!!! 🤍
https://youtube.com/shorts/VwJUTf7zI68?feature=share
I really loved the look
Ugly fit, beautiful meaning ❤️
Again the kardashian’s strategy to keep themselves in the public eye by creating controversy, we should just get used to this by now 🤙🏿🤙🏿
ok but I just realized that Kylie doesnt lool that diff from her old self without the makeup, I can see a lot of similarities , its just that when she wears makeup , she looks a lot diff
So kind Kylie ❤️😭 you look so beautiful
Kylie getting ready for her gypsy wedding
gorgeous!
I miss your vlogs really
I love you Kylie and Wow💋👍👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
What a bad test, it is the end of the civilisations. Yet there are so many people who sees beauty in this- it is shocking. What is wrong with manhood ? Is this really soothing that ordinary people subscribe for ???!#$^
Lol Kris Jenner bf PATTING /HITTING Kylie at her butts is normalized too 🤣🤣🤣. He must b thinking let me touch those plastic a$$ 😆😆😆
I am 33 years old about 10 years plus older than Kylie her plastic face literally makes her look older than myself, I wonder what she will look like when she is my age.
I love the why behind this dress but in the met gala there’s themes and if you got invited at least do it right
so pretty 😍
Kylie u are so beautiful Travis is lucky
she looks so different without makeup
Is the met gala theme optional? Why do people get so fired up over it then??? Why care anyways, it’s such a trivial matter 😂
Personally I love the dress and what it represents. Its a big honour. She was more original than Kim .
Who’s Virgil?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
That cap tho... its a No for me😆
Another hot ass mess
I liked the other dresses she tried on however the gown she went with has a nice story behind it
https://youtu.be/SydS6x3Kq9Y
https://youtu.be/SydS6x3Kq9Y
Her outfit was a waste of time and style terrible look way to go away from the theme
Who’s Virgil and Shannon?
I thought for a sec she was the one that got proposed to
❤️
😊
Don’t do Met it’s harmful
It's crazy to see how so many people work so hard for this one look
So Inspiring Video ☺️
“You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”
“Make each day your masterpiece.”
Kim dying her hair blonde Kylie: you're so bold for this  Kendall: I was going to say that  Also Kendall: bleaches her eyebrows
We all have guilty pleasures, I get that.  BUT people who follow the Kardashians have to be some of the dumbest people on the planet.
wtf is the hat LMAOOOOAOO
It would of looked stunning without the hat a shirt.. Less is more, he should realise this!
She doesn't care about anything besides promoting her make up line let's not pretend
the dress is dead. regardless of virgil being dead doesn’t make it a good dress. wtf
Did she just mentioned her son's name?
im sorry but if i were being “honored” by a veiled baseball cap i don’t think i’d love it
1:31 why nobody is talking about how cute Stormi😭
You look amazing in that dress kylie!❤️
sorry it UGLY
I love this dress, and I love Kylie  even more  of Kylie for honoring Virgil❤️
Why is stormis but the size bigger than mine... I'm 17 and I'm not entirely flat
I like this dress. Really chic. One thing i would change is that hat
How bad a dress can be👎👎👎👎👎
Love it!!!!
Kylie i genuinely respect you
ZMM on the ASX. Investment opportunity of a lifetime?
I thought Kim are using a lace front in Met Gala, but she bleached her hair Ohmy.
OSP on the ASX. Investment opportunity of a lifetime?
I can't stop but fall over her great personality

How does ariel not poke her eyes out with those nails😳
Πολεμος γινεται,πανδημιες σκοτωνουν κοσμο,παιδια πεθαινουν καθε μερα στην Αφρικη απο πεινα κ ασχολειστε με το MET GALA;;;ειστε τοσο ενθουσιασμενες που θα δειξετε ενα ηλιθιο κομματι υφασμα που χρυσοπληρωνετε....πφφφ ζωη με νοημα!!!
U disappointed us kylie
She's soo clever she put the grwm vid on her channel instead of Vogue or any other , this women right here is the brilliant of all in advertising. Loved the look but would've looked better without the sheer tshirt.
🤍
I really like the gown it's so pretty 👀😭

Wtf is with the tacky hat? 🤭🤬 no just no
A Pillbox or Victorian feather top hat would have made more sense
Where is travis scott
where is the look?
She wears this kind of clothe because she wants to marry Travis Scott 😂😂😂😂😂
No matter what she looks incredibly beautiful and stunning as usual 🤍
Aside from Kylies look, Stormi is so grown and she is beautiful!!
You do you. Who cares what everyone else thinks about it 💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️
i love how they went silent when stormi talked
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.   (Revelation 3:3)
she is stunning!!!!!!!!!! I like what she's wearing to the met, if I will be given a chance again to attend a prom I would definitely try to copy hers, this is beautiful!!!! I'm obsessed!!!!
She looked great ❤️
Maybe she’s manifesting for herself to be married
♥️
https://youtu.be/XeuDkbLPb0Q EURO GOLD COLLECTION 👀👀🎁✨🤑🤑🏆
did anyone notice where ever kylie goes stormi is there with her even though her sisters kids are not there but stormi is there every where which makes me so so happy that her kids r more important than everything it literary shows here......:)
i love the look and the hat makes it more special.

NOT GILDED GLAMOUR
This look is just awful, no matter what this bots say
please close the faucet while scrubbing your face.
ewwww
Everybody talking about how cute she is about the story behind her dress  and I'm here figuring out her lips need to be always drown with lip liner because without makeup it's just scary
God pleaseee allow me to be that rich in some point in this life or next.  😂😂😍😍😬🤔🤔🤪🤪🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
you think we forgot about the concert huh?
I used to be a FAN of KYLIE but after watching her on this DRESS I can boldly say I'm now a Whole AIR CONDITIONER
Recently every single ad has been straight up lying about what they are trying to sell or offer, youtube allows these leechs to continue to advertise and im sick of it, they have sold out to ad revenue and all these creators are suffering while they no doubt collect 100% ad revenue from every single advertisement and leave creators with mere percentages of a cent. Selfish greedy leechs run this platform and they profit off all the time you've wasted watching every single advertisement. I can guarantee you alone have made youtube at least $1000 from ad rev its actually sick and disgusting how little we the consumers mean to youtube.
Fuckin love you kylie

The second dress was better
She looks still the same, like 10 years ago, i dont know why always ppl talking about ps, because i havent seen any… stunning as always
Why is this garbage on YouTube?
You look amazing wearing that  kylie 😭❤
such a bad look all that team and thiss the final look??
Watching a room full of people lying to her telling her the dress looks “Soooo good!” 🤦🏻‍♀️
It's sweet how she doesn't even force stormi to pose a certain way or to take her fingers out of her mouth. It's like you wanna pose? Okay. You don't want to? That's okay too! Such cool parenting
*I was to think I was "lost" but  No I recognized I'm on a Road with no set destination and that is okay. I am learning and growing as I go🌺💙*
i loveee the look at 0:49, wish she went with that one, or even the dress without the shirt was beautiful
ur stunning no matter what ppl say who cares when u dont care but the look nailed it your look is my favorite look and my princess u look so beautiful

I think she's show the real her in this outfit.. that lil bit tomboy not really girly..
I’m honestly so just amazed at everything that happens behind the scenes! So much went into this look I love it
you look gorgeous kylieee! let the haters fuck off !! we love youuu ❤❤
Lol I have the same phone case as her but with my name🤯
astroworld
The look is giving 🔥
I very like kylie so much
I think the pictures don’t do it justice it’s looks better here in the video. I do wish she would of done curly hair, I think it would of looked good with the snapback
Why the fuck this video has 74k dislikes 🫥!!!
Tell me when you get the divorce
Honestly, I don’t get why people are saying her dress is ugly! It isn’t she Was wearing it in honour of her friend that passed away they were a designer. I’m pretty sure he designed the dress
you soo pretty kylie I love u and your outfit for met gala!!!!!!✨💕💓😍😍
Personally I  don't like this dress  Because it look like a long skirt with white normal tshirt ,I thought kylie wear any different dress
What a piece of art and a great way to honor a good friend 🙏 Kylie is so humble.
Bro…I thought this was Cady Heron dressed as a zombie ex wife lol
Unpopular opinion here as I can see by the comments but… while I think it’s extremely touching that she’s honoring Virgil, that’s not what the met gala is about. I don’t see how she couldn’t have done this at one of the many many other events she goes to. At the end of the day it’s not my life, not my place to judge but she still missed the mark on what the met gals theme was. I think a lot of people who did complain about the Kardashian/Jenner clan did so because none of them really dressed for the theme (which i guess is also sort of a theme among them lol).
https://youtu.be/nHGa360Vqe8
https://youtu.be/nHGa360Vqe8
Lol stormi is a preppy now, she’s wearing roller rabbit stuff🤌🏼
if all the ppl knew that story they’d react opposite way about her dress, was still beautiful tho
still didn't match the theme + ugly ☠
Kylie.. stunninnnn ever
Ok, nice story but the outfit was sh*t.
I love her gown her hat everything about it I love sheer white it's  beautiful it's stylish different all around beautiful as she...
The look got destroyed by the hat and the tshirt, should have gone off shoulder.
So I personally appreciate the Kardashians and Jenner girls because they show that women have power and always they are strong and so many ppl hate Kylie for her surgeries and all but I don't personally hate her because she is a strong mother of two lovely babies and she do have so many responsibilities so NO HATE FOR ANYONE but i just told my opinions about Kardashian and Jenner girls.
😍😍😍😍
https://youtu.be/cLivUQxkZhg😉👌
cantik banget maygat🤍🤍😭😭😭
Both her outfits were pretty cool the one she wore at the met went with theme in my opinion that was Morden version of gilded age and the after party one was absolutely gorgeous
Your baby daddy isn't ready to marry you anyways so here you are marrying "the met Gala" trying to live your dream of getting married one day
Who is Virgil ?
She's really gorgeous but without that t-shirt it was better in my mind
divorce babe divorce
She always look beautiful
That's really beautiful, Kylie. Rip Virgil. Khole looked great as well.
Her sons name is Jordan.
That was nice it was a modern wedding dress
Idk if I missed it by why did she do the hat?
This video gave me respect for the hat and viel
you are very beautiful
This video made me to subscribe her ❤️ I need this kind of dress to my wedding 🥺
Lmfao Kim getting her hair done
Just finished watching the episode were travis proposes. Kylie u were amazing in it🥰🥰
At the end of the video she mentioned how much days still for the next Met which means that she will SLAY IT.
Okay...........
lol. So dumb.
Bravo to Chloe for eating ice cream like a normal human being and boo on these other girls talking about her strict diets . Very triggering
I diidnt think the dress was bad it was the hat and the makeup
@6:59 That gold on the vase would've been a good addition to the dress like as shoulder belt around the arms/bondage belt. They should've added gold embellishments
Why did this shit pop up in my recommended? I can’t stand this family.
My birthday is May 4th
Who is Virgil…???

I love spending my time watching rich people get richer 😍
do you know that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life? If you were to die this very second, do you know for sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you would go to Heaven?  Let me quickly share with you what the Holy Bible reads. It reads “for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” and “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The Bible also reads, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” And you’re a whosoever right? Of course you are; all of us are.  I’m going to say a quick prayer for you. Lord, bless my friends and their families with long and healthy lives. Jesus, make Yourself real to them and do a quick work in their heart. If they have not received Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, I pray they will do so now.  If you would like to receive the gift that God has for you today, say this after me with your heart and lips out loud.  “Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free. Jesus, thank You that You died for me. I believe that You died for me. I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You’re coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost, a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I’m saved; I’m born again, I’m forgiven and I’m on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen.”  if you said that prayer, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I tell you today all your sins are forgiven. Always remember to run to God and not from God because He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you said that prayer, LIKE THIS COMMENT. Jesus loves you and I love you too ❤️
Looovee you queen

Now I feel kind of bad that I thought the dress was a little fugly, Because obviously means a lot to her
I love you kylie

This Comments make me sick. "Loving, caring, beautiful" honoring late friend. She should had honored victims of Astroworld
You are so beautiful ❤❤😭
A baseball cap and a tee shirt over a tacky wedding gown. What about this saus "gilded cage"? These reality tv stars know NOTHING about fashion or understand fashion history. Just puppets  that designers use.
You look beautiful 😻
❤
She seems like the kindest person 🥰
Even natural❤️🔥🔥🔥😍👌🏼😏natural stunner😏❤️🔥😉
I don't whybut I like the khloe with lamar now she dresses like old white lady lol
Rich people weird as fuck. These comments are even weirder
Its not relate to the theme but the look is really like a of white look so …
her life seems so amazing, I wanna be like her someday
Pffff❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏼😍😏each of you girls were absolutely fuckin hella fine and perfect lookin❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥😍👌🏼😏absolute hotties❤️🔥😏✌🏼😘
Kylie you and khloe look stunning 🤩 👏👏👏👏
Imagine if Kim’s hair fell out, that would’ve been great.
UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT: You can pay tribute to someone AND look good at the same time. For example, the MET Gala 2011, when they were honoring the late Alexander McQueen. All look FABULOUS AND stick to the theme at the same time.   I feel like Kylie wants to honor Virgil more than respecting MET theme. If that's the case, then I feel like that's an ignorant move. Imagine you have a party where the theme is red and you come in black cuz you want to honour a recently deceased person. That would ruin the mood wouldn't it?   There are times and places for tributes, and if it clashes or disrespects the theme of an event, I'd say you shouldn't move forward with the idea. You are not the host, you are a guest. As a guest, you should honor the requirements of the party you're invited to.
Holy shit❤️🔥🔥🔥SO fuckin magnificent with the MET dress/look😏❤️🔥🔥🔥👌🏼😍😏😘
Kylie looked so perfect going to the Met Gala and also looked so perfect without any makeup in her green sweats! Absolutely loved!
You’re so absolutely fuckin magnificently stunningly beautiful hot and sexy Kylie❤️🔥🔥🔥😍😏be back later✌🏼😘❤️😏❤️🔥
Love how Khloe shows up to Kyle’s final fitting holding an ice cream cone
It is gilded in some ways c'mon.. She still on theme.
YESS!! You looked fabulous Kylie 🤍🙌
i personally love the look! and kylie wore it so nicely and made it to the next level
https://youtu.be/uU7BKWlnnTE
te amo kylie 🤎
When you take a break from black fishing
Virgil 😭
Lookin stupid
May Virgil Rest In Peace, Sending my love and prayers, God Bless, Amen!!! 🙏🏽💜
Kylie, yes! Great style. Looooved the urban 👰‍♀.  Who doesn't love a t-shirt gown?! Well ✔ done.
10 people died and she seems so Unremorseful
I ADORE THIS LOOK!!! 💙
I love your met gala dress it's just beautiful and fits you so much 💕
Sya ay magandang babae na lalaki pumorma
i love how she includes her kids in everything before the MET good job Kyile I've been watching since keeping up with the Kardashians
Trashy
I still think she looked like garbage.
she looks younger in a snap back
Oh please. Do she forget the "theme" of the gala?. Cute as it might be. She fell way off the mark.
Kendall even knew just like we all did, that she should of worn the after party version 😬
Kylie is so kind❤
Storming with kris melts my heart!
I actually loved her outfit.
I cried during this because I just know how much Kylie loves to put on a show and dress GOOD for events like this. BUT as soon as I saw her walk in with the dress I just knew it had to be some kind of symbolism/tribute to Virgil. And now looking back, I just thought everything along with the after party dress was executed perfectly, ugh i love her
Why i find so cute when kris's babying Stormi on the airplane. Love this family♥️
The look is so cute it’s off white so it’s very fitting for there style it’s a great thought too I love it
Yeah, but the hat...like she couldve honored Virgil with just the dress, strapless with jewels and an updo. The hat was ridiculous and Virgil would have told her that.
Virgil would be proud. RIP 🙏
The look is horrible
Es que cuando se Caso laura lagrua asi se puso ese velo como atarralla
Win are you going to show your son face
🤭Ramon valladares desia de Laura Aguirre que era atarralla para pescar ese gorro ese velo jaja ☺️
dude you failed the met gala theme your dumb for ruining it
i liked it better w out the T shirt :/
I’m just gonna tell you it’s bad
Her daughters aren’t even close to Khloe she’s all shy with her , khloe talks to her like a fan
She looks ridiculous
Girl that is the most ugliest fucking thing 😭😭😭💀💀💀
kylie we want your son's face too not just the shoe🤗
Y love you petty 😍
She could've picked a way better look that still honored him but was both on theme and more cohesive
La mujer más bella del mundo 😍
Omg 😲😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Beautiful kylie
I thought she was throwing a hint about marriage 😅 I didn't think anything else but that.
Nice one🔥😘
I love how she always has her kids with her 🥰
Can't win them all, but she's still a winner nevertheless. Beautiful
the fact she knewv she was going to cry was sad,but still wore it
whatever u wear always looks beautiful and charming 🤍🥺❤️🫶
ME ENCANTO! ERES BELLA Y ANGELICAL 👸💖💯🙏⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
🇺🇲 TX 🥰HELLOYOUAMAZINGYOUGALATHEFASHONTHEDREESYOUAREBEST⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐✌️✌️
No Doubt, Kylie is a GREAT MOM. I got a warm fuzzy feeling when she said she took Stormi home when she was not feeling well instead of going to the Met Ball..
Damn Tati really made it to her Chanel congrats !
THIS IS ONLY MY OPINION! I WAS SO READY TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL OUTFITS,STYLES AND FASHION  AT THIS GALA!. PREFERABLY! THE KARDASHIANS. I JUST KNEW THEY WAS GONNA BRING IT! ESPECIALLY  KIM! 🤪😝🤭🤫🤔🙄😏😒🤨🤢😔😳WHAT HAPPEN TO YALL? 😳THIS WAS MORE A OF A ADAMS FAMILY THEME!. NOT MARRIED TO THE GALA LOOK. I  JUST WAS EXPECTING  SOMETHING  MORE. BECAUSE YALL ALWAYS BRING IT!. HEY KIM! Marilyn Monroe was a sex symbol. Beautiful and sexy and didn't  have to try hard. I should have been your stylist! Your hair should not have been in A PONYTAIL.THAT COLOR IS CUTE. IT JUST WASN'T THE RIGHT HAIR STLYE. You should  have had and up do with tendrils coming down on each side of your face. Your body has too much work for that RECREATION! Mrs Monroe was shaped like and hour ⌛ glass your shaped like watermelon 🍉 🤔.No offense  to none of you ladies. You  all are BEAUTIFUL!.YALL JUST MISSED THIS MARK.NEXT YEAR LADIES. SEE YOU THEN.
Shits ugly.
6:22 this moment just breaks my heart ❤ this is really cute.
Honestly I really like the dress though she looks good in it
I understand she wanted to honor her friend and the sentiments behind the look is beautiful but this was so mid, all their looks were tbh😮‍💨
I absolutely love Khloe!! She is just so real
💯 guarantee she doesn’t use her own skincare
Loved it mamacita❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ God bless
BUT WHY ISNT THE UGLY HAT ADDRESSED??? I NEED TO KNOW WHY SHES WEARING THAT HIDEOUS HAT
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
why can yall stick to the dress code! people who can't dress appropriately should not be allowed to go in.
KHLOE EATING A WHOLE ICE CREAM CHOCOLATE DIPPED BEFORE THE MET BUT KIM STARVED HERSELF 😂😂😂😂😂 KHLOE is DEF FAN FAVORITE
the second she put the t shirt on it was done for
Stormi and Olympia (Little Serena) resemble each other.
their lifestyle is absolutely insane
No offense Kylie but the final look gave very much ghetto wedding. Some of the other looks you tried looked better but I don’t get the wedding vibe.
Kylie fuiste hermosa, algo diferente pero tú lo haces lucir hermoso
Ok I will say it doesn’t look as bad here in this video as it did in all the pictures I’ve seen. 🤍
Ok I will say it doesn’t look as bad here in this video as it did in all the pictures I’ve seen. 🤍
You'll supportive here are still the once to trash her in another YouTube video 😂 f***ing sheeps
It does give old Kylie vibes
En serio nadie habla en español??
The person who is reading this comment i wish you great success health love and happiness
Dress was literally 💣 💋👄🤍
Kim walking around with her aluminum foils so relatable 😅😅
but how is this based of the gilded age
Love you kylie 😘

Habt ihr auch schwarze Socken an den Ohren? Denn ohne schwarze Socken an den Ohren geht hier gar nichts. Nur das wir es einmal gesagt haben.
Where was Travis?
Nice... Brothers and sisters please find time to know the reality of this life and it's real purpose...https://youtu.be/ZRhlGJ4WoCw
ok but, why the baseball cap, thats the only thing that bothers me
Why do they bother inviting them they must be illiterate because they never fulfill the theme requirements
so gorgeous without makeup
Yeah who is that Lucy men? P?
Beautiful look Kylie  🤩
Ma'am i support your cause, Virgil would be proud of you
that gown without the capa different hairstyle and the t shirt wouldve been SO unstoppable
4:45 did anybody noticed the engagement ring on Kendall’s hand?
The most ridiculous ish I've ever seen!
im so sorry but guys why the hat even the corset look was more on brand just ADD A SLEEVE ???  they arent telling you not to wear it just TRY AND BE ON THEME !! lmfao yall act like this is some huge devotion bro just literally add one detachable sleeve
Like the Oscars...played out...vulgar overindulgence when we o many are suffering.
love this video how kylie is pleas more of this video
Spoiled rich bitch that has no morals that was brought up by a screwed up family !
Because of Stormi Kylie don't love wolf equally...if stormi is the first child it does not mean that wolf is extra.....when stormi was born kylie posted alot of pictures of her but this time kylie is hiding his face........it looks so cute that she wants to keep the little boy away from media's eye BUT if wolf will not be famous he will not have any successful carrier....and on the other side kylie has been trendmarking stormi's name just for her to start her own bussiness empire but for wolf she is not even showing his FACE...she is another kris jenner who only pay attention to her daughters and i am so afraid and worried that what if WOLF also ended up like ROB
2:42
Her outfit = 🗑 asf
Ok she was just dead set on wearing off white ok ✅ good for her
I hate the hat

why doesn’t she name the boy milan
Stupid
I DONT WANT TO LIE.. I DIDNT LIKE IT AT FIRST BUT NOW PAYING ATTENTION TO THE LOOK !! IT IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.. SHE IS BEAUTIFUL
Follow up https://youtube.com/channel/UCb1nTjEFHe1EC0D_pISW2RQ
The first thought came to my mind when I saw her MG look was ..”Kylie is all heart,,whatever she do it came from heart” Having cap on depicts how she feels in now — it symbolise two things — travis wears cap,, other one is she has baby boy recently ,, I liked it it is something different
Dummy
Wearing something that makes you feel beautiful, confident and b/c there is a story behind it is living life! The Met needs to innovate and make it a theme.
That dress was horrendous.  Just being honest.  It looked  like  a strapless dress on top of a mesh shirt while going to a baseball tournament.
i love you Kylie 😆
Love you Kylie ur my dream 💕🥺 wish I could be as successful as you
I think KYLIE looks just so beautiful in this video! so happy kylie chose to honour Virgil and went with off white! We love you ky!
I really love the dress but specially the story behind why she wore it, even though it didn't match the theme I think she did a good job wearing it just because she lost someone she really appreciated and just wanted to honor him, GREAT JOB KYLE!!❤️
I know anyone won’t see this. I need help of thinking of a name for a mobile gas delivery service for a school project. I have no clue at all and need help what do you guys think will be a good name? Thank you and god may be with each and every one of you 🙏
You were beautiful at the met gala Kylie love your off white dress that you wore and stunning as always worked it boss queen
I think for this channel to be perfect it should have subtitles in Portuguese I'm a bug fan but I don't understand everything
Love how she just keeps talking and her makeup and hair stylists just be quiet
Kylie looks amazing in this outfit but I can’t be the only one who thinks she’s trying to tell Travis something 👀
7:51 "do you need me" "yeah"
The dress just doesn’t fit her correctly, it looks huge on her and it has absolutely nothing to do with the theme.  This would have been great for the Camp theme, but I don’t see how the stylists thought this would work for Gilded theme?
There like royalty
I really like your OUTFIT you look so beautiful this is one of the best styles in the MET GALA god job girl ✨👏🏻🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍👰🏽 #kylie_jenner
Kylie looked so beautiful ❤️🔥
This is what a dystopian future looks like. Watching a woman who is high on prescription drugs and provides nothing to society get millions of views all because she's from a famous family. At least they're inclusive enough to be with anyone with any black dude who has over a million dollars.
Kylie looks awesome🌟
Looked perfecto
Sei arrivata pure fino in Italia per farti vestire così di merda....
I liked it. The cap is so American right since thats the theme. If the British has a hat then American has a cap.
Anyone who don’t like this clearly don’t know Virgil❤️
No one else is marrying her. Guess that’s the best option.
Tried to skip through the video to explain the baseball cap hat part... Anyone can tell me why it was an important piece & decision made? 👀
It’s giving me Prom dress sweet 18 baby
https://youtu.be/a7yvMQq6-XQ
She is always cute and stunning
Kris and stormi relationship is so cute
This family needs to be put in jail for ruining now two generations of girls
the fact that i live in palm springs
perfeitah
There were so many better choices
YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT LATELY IS JUST TO STOP LOVING YOU AND FORGET LIKE A BAD DREAM HONESTLY I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS SO HARD TO JUST STOP LOVING
You can just tell how many people don’t understand fashion by all the absurd comments. Everyone has their own opinions but how you go about it says everything.  Amazing story and look, love everything about it! 💜🕊
I love stormi so much she’s adorable
I really love seeing BTS of amazing big special events like these can't wait to see the full behind the scenes on the Kardashians HULU also the dress looked soo GORGEOUS and DIVINE! I do think it would've been better without the hat.
*That dress may not be the best one she've worn on the red carpet for the met but her dedication to pay tribute for Virgil is inspiring and emotional. Also the fact that Kylie is indeed aware of the possible outcome from the harsh public opinions is no longer necessary for her to care for personally. I love the dress either way and she rocked it!*
She could have still honored him and wore Off White but it didn’t have to be THIS dress and look… js
you should really fire your stylist....man this is bad ....every style reporter confirmed it: the entire met gala this year was just boring and bland...
The dress actually looked nice but the cap  and t-shirt was not matching but  that's okay since it's always trial and error when it comes to fashion but it's  so nice she wore it to honor her friend
kylie also wore a wedding dress because she knows travis is never gonna marry her
You can say all you want about Kylie but she’s such a good mom ❤️😭🥰❤️
Rich 🤑 https://youtube.com/shorts/Y_I_hR19L84?feature=share
i actually found her choice really cool and different and i def have much nicer opinions on it than some others' outfits, basic but pretty and playing it safe is something I despise.
Kylie is such a great mom!
Extremely lovely in every way KYLIE
it's still ugly asf. I'm sorry. This is the met boo, you will be judged lol
That moment when your name is Shannon
kylieeeeee......❤️
Her Theme is Married to Met Gala but Her facial Expression during the walk was Sad... i guess her marriage is kinda sad too....
ow, kyle this is such a cute behind storyyyyyy. u look so so beautiful and happyyyyy, the dress was sooo beautiful! 💐
You litteraly rocked that outfit ! So stunning kylie ❤❤
Wow Kylie looks beautiful without makeup!
It’s really nice how supportive all the sisters are if each other
You spent hours to get ready and you still looked like shittttttttttttt
you are so attractive woman i love you 🔥⚡🌸
I love the cap
It's the hat!!  ... period.
I still dislike the look Kylie could have done so much better + I'm shocked she wore this 😭 I like the idea of what the look represents but the execution looks so outdated + old...
🔥🔥🔥👑👑❤️❤️❤️
Chloe looked lovely Kylie I didn't like it just my opinion
Christ died for our SINS, according to the scriptures📜, and that He was buried🪦, and that He rose from the dead on the third day,  according to the scriptures📖 (1Corth15:3-5)   ... all YOU have to do my  friend is:  Put Your FAITH in Jesus Christ, that He took your place   on a cross to die for YOUR SINS  ... and God will grant you ETERNAL LIFE, as a free gift 🎁🙏✨, the very moment You  put your TRUST in Him..  ....God Bless 🙌........
vigil will be very happy and kylie  have so much humanity she proved it
Honestly, i loved the look.. i don't think it deserves a lot of hate.
They wasn't even allowed there until Kanye got married to Kim the things and places he's got them allowed into flew to New York to get Kim's porn tape took it bk to her the same nite she did SNL and kissed Pete and this is the thanks they gave him
The “hi momma” from stormi was so cute
kim i love you blessings
Kylie Jenner the most Latina looking white person ever her plastic surgery gave her latina face features
BUT AFTER  PARTY
No may you like that after giving birth 3 mths ago! The rumor that she actually gave birth in late 2021 makes more sense bc then it she would of had 6+ mths to get her body back! No way the baby was born on 2/2/22!
no.
i don’t care what anyone says about kylie’s look it’s not supposed to be for the met theme. it was to honor virgil, and this dress means so much. go kylie for even going!! you looked spectacular kylie 🤍
i really love her but wth she didn't even went with the theme? it sure as hell don't look like guilded glamour
when are we meeting baby n2
Remember that time everyone let Kim bleach the absolute sh*t out of her hair the day before the Met? Member that? 🤭
Rich people always leaving the tap open wasting water, WTF
7:25 Love to see what is under the dress.
Honey that looked pathetic ngl
https://youtu.be/-P9T2ZDbyMI
❤️
All love for you kylie ❤️
She literally is soooo cute 😍 I loved his look so much Kylie 💯🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
The face is 100% plastic
You people are so obsessed with celebs and will defend them over your own family. It’s pathetic.

Cuando te cazas pero sos del barrio😎
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.

Cringe
She looks so good with no or little makeup.
A true business woman mentality She's Litteraly promoting her products with this video lmao
I liked the off white choices better but either way she did the right thing choosing honoring Virgil x love u
Kylie you are so humble 💖💖
No matter how much meaning is attached to it, it’s still ugly
I think she filmed this after how would she know everyone would say some & nothing to do with Virgil it’s just why her team chose that dress but that second dress wassss everything !!!!!
Kylie Jenner 🌼
Didn’t fit the theme
Seeing how it was without the top part covering her shoulders, I wish she hadn’t. It looked amazing even with the hat until she put that on. It ruined it for me. However, I also have zero style at all so for all I know everyone else liked it 🤣
She hasn’t the paid Bangladeshi workers
"""I respect to everyone who were involved in this, Siriously the best pice that I ever seen on YouTube, HATS OFF TO YOU ALL ! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS !❤
Love you 😍 💗 that was stunning 😍 💖
I love you very much
You beautiful very much🤍
I just love they r supportive to each other
I love Kylie. I do. But even if queen Rih had worn this shit, I couldn’t get behind it🥲 I was super disappointed with her look. BUT, having heard her talk about the sentimental value, I’m glad she wore what she wore and chose not to care about external opinions!
It's really sweet that the Kardashians do everything together as a family.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Stormis little voice 😭😭
Gorgeous 🤍
Kylie is literally such a good mom🥺🤍
The off-white dress was wonderful, the problem was the shirt.👀

Effortlessly beautiful, her inner beauty inspires 🤍
Stunnerrr omgoshhh !!!
Love her 🤍 love what the gown meant to her 🤍 love how much virgil meant to her 🤍
were is your new baby
I actually appreciate the way this family maneuvers their lives - TOGETHERNESS without the drama among the girls and their mother.        Compare that to other Families with similar shows like the Braxtons and many others.        The Kardashians have so much more class than the rest.
That was great. I adore the Kardashians. They're just good people. No one's perfect so why should they be.
I love u Kylie, ur dress looked stunning 💜
You look awesome
Awful dress
That hug Corey gave Kylie at 1:41 i don’t like him he’s weird
To have so many people waiting for you has to be the life. I know it’s gets overwhelming but bruh the whole world loves you!
Everyone want to see the baby and his name

I Love Kylie dress she so Beautiful❤️
It’s appropriate that the video is 9:11 minutes long cause that’s what needed to be called on whoever decided this cap was the move.
Can anyone remind me what her career is?
I just remember that few people now days type negative comments without thinking. It's like pandamic makes this people much more comfortable being dumb. No thinking nor research just typing. Im sorry.
The look is still not it for me but I'm glad it had meaning behind it and she did it for herself. That's what life should be about. Doing things for you and not caring about anyone else. Love to see it.
Don't fkking go to the MET if you're not going to go with the Theme. She looked like shit. 😂
Kylie you're beautiful
This dress is very beautiful tbh
The orange glove, ballgown and hat worked better.
Excellence as Usual Kylie!! 🌩🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
No podes vestirte asiiii . Y ese gorro 😏
Kylie looking so good.  Really beautiful viedo. Nice see to watch.
I love that she didn't give a Fuck what anyone was going to say it was ABOUT honoring her friend and the fact that he was supposed to be there with her and wasn't. I took it as him being married to FASHION and that's what the night is ABOUT, honoring FASHION. So going 📴 theme was totally fine. I also loved the backwards baseball cap. So totally street wear.
Wtf this was posted 20 hours ago😨😨
i don't really like the dress but i do love the reason kylie is wearing it. And people shouldn't hate it!
Sérieusement tu dois renvoyer tes stylistes ils sont hypocrites 🤣🤣
This dress is very beautiful😍😍😍
Hi! Best wishes keep taking online classes for credits and understand how to home school that blessed young families were always seeing on the television 🥰
Khloe looked insanely good
i like it
I never pay my face dry I just leave the water to absorb
how many suckers paid for all this from their small incomes
I think the dress is honestly beautiful she should have just not worn the hat or the T-shirt underneath and it would have been perfect. Maybe add some big puffy sleeves or long gloves.
I did some construction right across the street for her house in calabasas
Love you sooo much 💕💕🌺
Worst dress ever

Poor kids
When you have a wedding at 5 and basketball practice at 8
We can tell that Kanye isn’t around anymore 👀🧑🏾‍🦯🤦‍♂️
turn off the faucet while you wash your face. Xoxo
It looks best without the White T shirt tops.
XD
I get the story behind the dress but they couldn’t have come up with a better option. It just didn’t hit and that’s just me being honest. It may have looked good on the runway just not for the Met. I’m sure they have better options.
Don't judge the book by its cover (talking abt the dress)
King kylie vibes
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I love her so much
De grande quiero ser como tú
2:40 baby Webster
Ngl I really like this dress
Obnoxious spoiled brats, unaware and uncaring of anything happening in the world.
I Lowkey wish travis was with you.It would be so great🥰🥰❤❤
👏🏻🤩
The cap is just so cool I love it❤️ Kylie look fab in every outfit
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
bro wutt bout travis then?😐
Kylie....... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭❤️❤️
Looks still bad regardless how many people work hard in it. Blunder of the season.
😘😘😘😘😘♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Can’t wait to meet you 😁😁😁😁
You’re doing well Kylie😻
Stop with the injections
What a shallow, boring bunch of plastic Americans! Can’t believe where the world is going with people worshipping the Kardishians 🤮
I forgot she has a son for a sec
What people saying about hate that spoken by everyone  don't speak about that  only speak about how beautiful she is ❤️😘
I love it 🤍 n i dislike kendalls ♠️
I think this 0:55 is the better look then met gala white one
But just why the cap 😂
kylie is GORGEOUS
Someday over the 🌈 Dad will 🚶‍♀️ her down the aisle
So disconnected from the real world, it is disgusting.
We totally forgot about  wolf
Off topic but pleeeeeease tell us the name of your baby boy 💙
Am I the first person liked this vid?
She stole beyonce Tour look
DID I FUCKEN ASK. No talent
You looked so beautiful and the fact that you were honorinh someone elses legacy is so cool.
The hat makes sense when you meet Dad 👨‍👩‍👧
Not y’all switching up and actually praising this outfit. Who gives a fuck what the story is behind her ridiculous dress, she did not eat and it was not theme of the Gala. The met Gala was a fucking disaster.
The dress is okay but the stupid hat makes everything so ugly has to be one of worst  and ugliest dress + cap combo I have ever seen
I am not even saying the hat it is not intentionally inexplicable. So is Bruce

You guys are really downplaying Virgil. He was an amazing designer and he wouldn't have allowed Kylie to go to the Met like that. He had so many amazing wedding pieces, Kylie's design team honestly let her down.
Kylie looked so perfect going to the Met Gala and also looked so perfect without any makeup in her green sweats! Absolutely loved! 🤍💚🤍💚
I don’t understand y’all saying “the dress is beautiful” “she looks stunning” “the look is amazing!” Like yes. It is. And the meaning behind it is so wholesome. But it doesn’t have ANY relevance to the theme? And ppl need to respect that instead of choosing to be blind to it and worshipping kylie. She’s a celebrity and she could have worn this to literally any of the other million or so festivals, but she chose this one, and she’s happy so good for her. But the way people are being totally blind to the fact that she completely missed the mark for theme?
The hat is inexplicable
Khloe and that Choco Top ice cream 😫 looks so damn good i want one lol
You & khole was the worst dressed Jenner/Kardashian’s 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
We love youuu
Face looks bloated as fuck. She is ageing like milk. Lay off the Botox
Why wouldn't she wear the one she clapped about? Understand the off white tribute but couldn't someone (her sister's) tell this kid she failed the theme!
This was the wrong look sister 😘 you looked like dumb dumb and dumber aside your sisters 🤣 except Kendal she actually knew the way to go
Still waiting for it to devolve into Voyeur 📷
The hat 🧢👰
It’s ironic not iconic.
i hate it, honestly. i wouldn't even like it for an actual wedding. and what is that cap?
me: yes   The white hat: hello   me: g2g
❤❤❤❤
Dammm she’s actually really ugly under that makeup
Ur amazing
There isn’t a meaning behind it. That wasn’t her friend, it was Kanye’s friend and they’re using his death for attention.
Anglo Saxon energy!! I’m trying to figur out what she’s going to look like at 35 lol
They asked storm if she liked it and she didn’t say yes lol!! Listen to your kid
She is so beautiful without makeup 😊
Didn’t like this look sorry 😢
you are so beautiful kylie
Why do they always grease their hair and not natural, I would be able to stand that it's ugly
WTF would they do without the over used OCD "AMAZING" word
How ABSURD, EVERYONE TREATING THEM LIKE SUPERSTARS!!!  FOR WHAT?  TAKING PICS OF THEIR JIGUNDA ASSES???  THE WHOLE BUNCH HAS NO TALENT AT ALL!   THEY HAD A HIGH PROFILE FATHER, THAT'S ALL - THEY ARE A BIG ZERO!   GO AWAY.......& GET SOME EDUCATION; YOUR GRAMMAR, VOCABULARY,  FILTHY MOUTHS & CHARACTER IS ABOMINABLE!  YOU ALL SHAME YOUR LATE FATHER - HE MUST BE TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE, SEEING ALL HIS DAUGHTERS DRESSED LIKE $2 WHORES!!!!!
That poor girls face is so full of filler at such a young age - she really needs to give the fillers a rest
I love you
Khloe has no makeup on that's why she hiding and not letting camera get her
Yikes
the most horrible dress at the Met 🥵
I like your dress but this hat.....
Everything is perfect until the cap 🧢 is there
https://youtu.be/8yt0VcU36kQ
I love KY but the cap was still a no for me. The after party dress was amazing
Actually it's very ugly.....
she wants to get married so badly.
Imagine not going to THE Met gala bc your child is sick- that’s some rich people stuff but it’s sweet that she cares about her daughter that much to miss such an important event 💗👏👏 Edit: btw she looked gorgeous idc what ppl say ✨🤌
So stupid
I should have thought first before I judged, btw that dress is really pretty I just really hated to admit it before. You are such a sweet person! You are such a good friend
i love when kylie gets in her icon mode like when she’s staring at herself in the dress and u can just see her face like absolutely serving cuz she knows she looks good as fuck. loving the confidence
Honestly I don’t think it was the hat it was the tshirt that made it look so tacky
Her face is starting to look really old from the surgery :/
Kyle's Worst look ever 😔
Kyle you look stunning this dress was everything keep slaying ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you.from Thailand
A mess
How come Khloe Kardashian doesn't go to the met ? ...oh she did😊
What a strange video.
I love her so much
Am I the only one who loved her outfit and her look 👀 Now that I know the story behind it, I love it even more!
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
Even tho she wore this in honor of her friend who passed, what honor is this giving being on the worst dressed list on all articles?  It’s a stunning dress if you take away the tshirt and hat which they should’ve done.
Did anyone see stormie wearing roller rabit!!!
The fillers starting to give tiger or cat like face looking puffy I hope she don’t get addicted
Wo she just created another style which is fancy, simple for the next  century that everyone is going to wear no skin showing, just simplicity with classicism
It‘s so sweet that she didnt attens at last years met gala because stormi was sick. Now thats a caring mother
wow she really have baloon-fat face :D
💕💕💕💕💕
So, she turns 40 this year, right ?
Sis omg some of these looks are better minus the hat I mean I can’t believe what you was giving at the met my eyes was bleeding
какая же страшная .... ужас.
Kylie looks old for her age.
I mean the look is thrashy but if you love it go for it
I love her how in everything she puts her efforts whether its her post;'captions'and everything from her cosmetics to her family she's so organized and love what she's doing
I love you Kylie sis you are queen ! Omg but this look wasn’t it!!! And the cheek filler is starting to give very tiger lady small face big eyes an lips is better pooh
Wonderful, my Kylie is beutiful in every way, love you so much Ky😘
https://youtube.com/channel/UCSTRcHLFpokBrBNkMoFE43Q
I think she knew she would rock anything she wear. So wearing that unflattering dress was probably a way to get all the attention on Kim with her MM dress.
o god
Blake outfit ❣️❣️❣️
why she got white brim tho?
4:34 Kim should of just worn a wig 😑
oh kylie i love your disregard for people fuck the haters✨🫀 🫀
Kylie needs to vlog more 😩
First and Last please.
One of her worst dress ever
girl bye
la gorra le da el toque turro
The look and dress is stunning & elegant!! Kylie look so gorgeous, how can people hate it?!?! Somemore Kylie is honouring her friend Virgil, it’s so touching 🥲 we are gonna ignore all these tasteless idiots 🤐
How many people got trampled to death on your marriage? Just curious.
👁‍🗨➕𝟏𝟖𝟏𝟒𝟒𝟐𝟗𝟑𝟐𝟓𝟐. ▶️
IM GETTING MARRIEEDDD
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Or the tshirt could have stayed and she just done a different make up and hair …. I pretty much think pppl really hated the neck up
Kylie…. You FAILED girl!! Sorry but this was NOT Guilded Glamour! No even a little
Bruh...-- Private planeಥ‿ಥ Girl you are living my dreams!!
I loved this outfit idc what anyone says
I mean... she looks cute though.
She looks like anjali If you know you know😃
Kylie so beautiful iconic.
The gown would have been prettier without the shirt and if she did her hair … it’s that simple … the dress is gorg she styles it poorly …. That’s the real issue
Kylie you stole my heart.
I'm loving these comments, we support you kylie💝
Damn she looks good after two kids 🙂
You look gorgeous ✨🌹
Kadin cok guzel ama iste hep estetik ama icindeki duygu cok guzel kizi da cok tatli
It's funny how people can easily forget!!!
Aw this is so sweet!! So glad you have such a special memory with this dress. It was gorgeous!!🤍
Her world is your world #2 trending USA after Starwars 77×7
Rich as fack and she can't afford good stylists.
Yesss the idea of your look is nice, the design was beautiful love u Kylie Godbelss
I love meth too
Wow no one gives a fuck
her lips are about to pop
She’s rlly pretty but the dress…..ehhh
Ooh So gorgeous 😍🧿😘
this is so bad
White girls aren't thugs with backwards baseball caps
Life is just so unfair! Everyone should have the opportunity to live like Kylie and stormie!! Its so sad that she doesn't donate her money and help the world to be better. So sad! She is nothing she is just a human like us but only because pf money they treat her like Queen... I don't understand this!!
Lovely💕
I must have ugly taste because I LOVED her look. It was beautiful, gilded and had a modern urban twist with the hat. It felt so her and had so much attitude! If zendaya wore it ya’ll would eat it up.
She's so fearless to say that she didn't care about other people's opinions about the dress cause she wore it because of Virgil and appreciate his work. Love her for that
Wowww❤️
so you guys only like the dress bc of the meaning? that’s weird, i really like the dress and it’s fashion history references…and i LOVE a good cap 🧢
3:07 fire this person
Muy bonita 😍, con su, vestido de, novia
Kylie you look so gorgeous💕
Queeennnnn i love your lifestyle 😩💕💕
Now if Bruce was in the dress Met Gala forever
Also, the met has a theme. If you aren’t going to follow it, doesn’t fuckin turn up. Wear that dress somewhere else!
Beautiful Kylie ❤️
Everyone needs to understand the dress is beautiful. Think we can all agree on that. It’s the horrible way it’s been accessorised that people have an issue with (mesh t shirt, SnapBack, veil, earrings, the makeup was also awfulllllll)
The cap wuz offset 💡
You  look amazing  beautiful  Kylie 😍 😘 ❤  And I  love you so much ❤ 💖 💗 💓 ♥ 💛
Just because something has meaning doesn’t mean you have to wear it & look stupid. She deserved to be on the worst dressed list, rightfully so
They had a great theme this year and the whole Kardashian family went against it (among others), dress the theme or don’t go.
Everything looks beautiful except for the Cap 🙄
I wish she also put her after party look in here!!
The media conviently left out this story smh
its giving katniss everdeen attending the capitol interview in her wedding dress
Sweet tribute to Virgil🤍
Her outfit sucked
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Maybe her Dad can 🚶‍♂️ her down the aisle... well
Everyone: hates the dress Kylie: I made a documentary about the dress Everyone: watches documentary  Kylie: slips in ad for Kylie skin   This family KNOWS HOW TO GET TO WORK
How did you pee with that on???
Shes ruined her face with all that cosmetic surgery.
kendall is such a scorpio a fricken negative nancyyyyy all the time mixed with a pick me girl smh
KYLIE REGULARLY ON YOUTUBE❤️
Show the baby👶 face kylie
Married to purple 🐔
She's so sweet, her heart is pure gold 💛
she looked good tbh
Really had to make a whole video for an explanation 😂
Ruby Page 13 hours ago (edited) This is my rough draft of a song so tell me if you like it...               💔❤‍🩹💙    I'm still here, thinking the same thoughts, you said you would stay but i guess i wasn't taught, id never compare to the person you thought, was me sept' its not. i cant just reach to the stars even though you're wa-ay past mars. what if i still hold the scares that you told me were not who you are? I can't just change me for you even though that's all i want to do. you made me feel worthless, its true, now how bout' you?       💔.
QUEEN
I actually liked the look, don't really get why it got so much hate... I honestly think people hate on the Kardashians/Jenners just for the sake of it at this point. The look was very Virgil, his classic concept of the urban bride. It wasn't super on theme, but neither were 90% of the Met looks lol. It was fresh, it was cute, she looked stunning. Stop hating.
Omg
I don't like this look at all.... she could have chosen a much better dress...
love youuuuu!!!!
I love the dress idk what everyone hates abt it.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Love ya Kylie
The only thing I didn’t like was the hat but to know that she’s was honouring her late friend makes me wanna cry so much, she’s a caring person and love her family and friends deeply 🥺💓
Stunning Kylie
💜💜💜
When did she turn 40?
❤❤
Everything was awesome leaving that thing on her head
She better marry the gala cause that boy ain't
still frumpish though..
So bougie.  This isn't Kylie's prom this is the met gala, they had a theme.  Soooooo gauche.   Kartrashian
Hiiiiiii
Honey you shine like a diamond 💎😍
I think the fit is really pretty, I just think the hat is a little out of place. I think the only issue people had with the look was the hat
What a horrible 👗
ilovethedress
Sorry but who is Virgil?
Queen 💖
Less go queen, luv u and yoyr gorgeous dress🤍🤍
🤍🤍🤍
STOP LEAVING THE TAP RUNNING WHEN YOU’RE NOT USING THE WATER JFC
O mais perto que o Brasil chegou na Kylie kakaka arrasou Tati
Khloé is so sweet, she always gives everyone compliments. And Kim omg, she’s always so funny about her accomplishments. Like: I lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks and I’m dyeing my hair for 10 hours yeah 😂  Also: kylie should start an own ASMR channel. I think she would be the ASMR Queen of the century.
I loved it
😫❤️
Usually Kylie looks fab but this outfit is actually horrible, it just looks ridiculous.. sorry Kylie not Ur best look...
You are amazing and of course beautiful and kind  I am so happy for you By the way  stormi is so cute Congratulations Kris
I'm so glad I watched this because babygirl I was so confused about the look. ❤️
It wasn’t really giving but she looked so pretty
idc still very ugly
Hearing her say my son sounds soo unreal
She knew it wasn’t her best dress ever but she still did it to honor her friend and that’s why she mentioned not caring about ppl not liking the dress
you girls look so beautiful without make up on
Kylie🤍🤍
1:38 anyone see stormi smack kylies bottom?
https://youtube.com/shorts/_7fUcTptu_A?feature=share
1:38 omg- not stormi smacking Kylie like- that's some else y'all

I honestly loved the dress and the whole look from the moment I saw it!! Amazing! 😍

Girl! Why do u have to Look perfect all the Time❤️❤️??
She look So Stunning ❤️😚
i know y’all are talking abt the dress but stormi looks so grown up and she’s adorable ❤️
Gangster bride I love it
love kaklie kito <3
Its so pretty she look like an angel❤️❤️🌹
Does she really use her company products.....they are not really usable
i actually liked this look when i first saw it, it wasnt too bad, it matched the theme somewhat and it had a nice backstory to  make it special, thats enough ig
Absolute abomination.
Gross
Guys, even Corey attends the MET, and I don't think I've ever seen Khloe & Kourtney attend.... Glad to see Khloe attended this year.  This look was sooo Kylie, loved it!
It all makes sense now 🥰✨ her after party dress was so beautiful ✨
This makes her look so much more special after she said her WHY. Yet another lesson for us all not to judge a book by its cover. 🤍
❤❤❤❤
Kylie’s such a good mom
It was on theme. The theme was in America: An Anthology of Fashion the DRESS CODE was gilded glamour, therefore she was on theme since the dress together with the detail of the hat both belong to American fashion
Stormi child to room around her mother.
I admire you a lot 🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼 🧿
You and Travis got divorced
Las celebridades americanas son el peor ridículo 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
People are like Kylie before her surgerys wasn’t this gorgeous she buyed her face and body and she didn’t have that much confidence as it is right now, she’s feeling pride of herself and that’s not good.” She has been in front of the camera with her family since she was so little! All of us would like to change something about ourself when we’re not feeling good about it, like a nose surgery, right? She was also born into a wealthy and stylish family from beginning. When she was a teenager she had straight brown hair, stylish skin colour and big eyes that a lot of teens wish for. It’s not that much easy to become a self made billlioner at age 21. I love her confidence and we all know people are jealous; love how she’s keeping her crown up💗
The best part for me in this entire vlog is when she said thank you to everyone who've help her to get ready. her attitude was different from the last met gala when she wear purple ball gown full of fur
🥰🥰🥰
Wow ☺
i love the dress more without the mesh top and 🧢 but she slayed it thoooo
So ugly that cap eww
Should’ve worn the after party dress instead just sayin
People just judge , criticize and troll without even knowing the back stories or the effort the team put to pull the Met looks off
Why do the K, J's  think they can just make up their own theme?  Yeah, nice sentiment but could have still done something within the theme.
no this is so  cute
🤍🤍🤍
#forvigil👉👈
Every other option was better than the one she chose! Just because it has meaning, doesn’t mean it was on theme. When it comes to the met, it doesn’t matter how much money or fame you have, if you ignore the theme, you look like a fool. At least the world has finally agreed on something- her look this year was awful
Wow ❤️❤️❤️
At the end of the day, there was a story behind this dress. She looked stunning either way. Always does!
I literally hate Corey with them always
Pls even tho she's wearing a basketball hat, kylie still slayed😍❤🥰😭😩
what's with that baseball cap? 💔
Everyone’s just forgot about what Travis did
You looked amazing 💕
M losing my " Confidence " me itni mehnat karta hu singing me... Lekin koi chote you tuber ko support nhi karta sab stars ko karte h bs😭😭😭😭
Whats his name now ;-;
Why you wearing that hat 😂
U r looking damn cute Kylie😘😘😘😘 looking gorgeous ❤️❤️❤️
Naaah nibbi i dont like it
What a beauty. She is always my sweetie.
I love the “Lilly at my sons shoes” Too cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute
Yeah it’s a no for me 🤷🏽‍♀️
Oh my God you’re so perfect😭😭😭
I dont get the cap. Looks out of place from the dress..
OMG You look so beautiful 😍
You didn’t even have the IQ to understand the theme oml-
The dress itself is gorgeous but the rest of it all made this look like some trash 18 year old theme party.
your dress was amazing and you must be so proud of you kylie !!
What a shallow pretentious self absorbed person, but no fool, she has made millions from it.
all these are trash
say what you want but she killed it. most of the people missed the theme, whatever. The look was beautiful, especially on her and the tribute to Virgil was beautifully done. I'm happy she did that. Honestly one of my top 5 picks of this year
If she would have kept the shred long sleeve with at dress would have been better!
Is that the theme though?
who is this shit? why this shit is so popular?
I’ve watched kylie grow up with stormi and it’s so lovely to watch her be a working mother but also be an famous/celeb and love her closest of people she works with
Kylie you look beautiful 😘❤️
Kylie looks so happy
Beautiful ❤️
You looked so bad ew
i don’t know why many people judge this dress. i honestly think it looks amazing and the story behind it makes it even more beautiful.
Actually the more I look at her outfit the more I like it and her just wanting to honour Virgil (sorry if I spelt it wrong) makes sense why she wore that dress to the met
The cap is eek for me But still the gown is gorg 👌🏼
The only one that I can do to get it *
Bc7jamuka
I just hate what u wore to met..R u Serious 😶 disaster.
шо за хрень в тебе на голові родная зніми кепку і прочитай тему мет гали2022 ше раз
It's not my favorite but I adore the idea and Kylie is definitely the only person who could ever hey away with it
I love that second dress... it looks so amazing
Oh my god i feel so bad for making bad comments about her dress like saying she wants to desperately wants to get married. Now i know why she wore this dress to honor her great friend Virgil and you can just feel it and hear it in her voice. Omgg 😲😲😲😊
no hate comments?
You are best performer ,best wife,best mother and best business women ........no one can be like you the way you maintain your personal and professional life is great
Kylie I'm missing your vlogs video🥺 please keep uploading yt video I love watching your videos
I loved this look even before seeing this video. She looks absolutely stunning.
It's good 😊
I don't understand this hat, but please... she likes it...
Game play Different  https://youtube.com/channel/UCTJgdIwYTJX3cvPWQJzpdFg
stunning!!!✨
tbh the gown itself is pretty but its just the short sleeves that really throw it off
I can't help but notice how postive and radiant she is. I lover her energy and how attentive she is to each member of her team. She looks amazing and this was a perfect tribute to virgil
Ur sooo beautiful
We appreciate the content sis keep it coming. Our mini Keeping up with Kylie.
I think she wanted to wear big because she gained weight from her pregnancy and she doesnt want to show it in a slim dress
She really does sound like that TikTok when she talks to Stormi 😂
Stormi has grown up so much 😅
idc what ppl say about this look, the story behind this look is beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
How did Kim bleach her hair for 10 hours and still rock yellow hair? She’s a millionaire that could have gotten the best of the best but walked out patchy
6:27 these is how her lips look like in real life
Like her team lied her so bad
Bruh tbh i find her Very pretty in this dress.
So many yes people around her the look was trash tbh
You were absolutely stunning Kylie 🌻❤❤ loved the look by the way💋
She has soo much filler 🫣
wish i could live her life for a day… she seems to have everything perfect in my eyes…
💌🤍✨
Did someone recognize which cushion foundation Ariel is applying a 6:17?
Who is Virgil?
https://youtu.be/ylqUOMuaFlw
Can a,wats count on kylie vlog dropping
out of theme.
I wished u didn't wear the Tshirt buuut u were looking so stunning
Kendall used Kim’s leftover bleach for her eyebrows
Love it but why the cap?
girl follow the damn theme next time.
Kylie look so good and pretty❤️
my birthdays today and she posted tytyty
3:56 khloe sayin look how tan Kendall is lol
I liked the dress but didn't like the hat at all
Lmao kendall reaction sayin in its ruffle cuz her own is too but her train is way bigger n black n together they got matching looks like in 2019
All the stormy moments are so cute n the way she didn’t attend last time cuz she got sick
I love u Kylie so much just keep going and don't listen to people ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
you looked amazing Kylie, this is exactly what Virgil would've wanted for you.. a little controversy for the right reason 🤍🤍🤍

0:50 loved this orange gloves tan tulle dress damn but maybe fir her final look take the earrings off n add the ballroom gloves
the t shirt and the hat are bad. everything else is beautiful
That was king Kylie
A lot of ppl judge n know nothing about fashion or the designers
she looks absolutely amazing
Didn't she just have a baby?? Where is it
Illuminati puppets
Some1 co,oared it to Simpson wedding dress meme it’s perfect
I love it even the throwback with the backwards SnapBack cool twist to the bridal wear since it’s off white known for street wear
Omg she looks like the old Kylie!🥹🙏🏻❤️👏🏼
Botoxxxxxx  x xx
she looked beautiful, it's so sad how people criticised the outfit without knowing the meaning behind it :(
For everyone saying kylie was ignoring kendalls anxiety attack She handled the situation perfectly by trying to distract her sister
girl why do you NEVER wash yo forehead?!?!??!
Kylie you look beautiful in that white dress
Okay i like the outfit now
John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. https://youtu.be/vckHW_5dfqg
That’s not even the theme tho
Since she was supposed to go last year, I would die to see her look
Magical x
I’m sorry but her hair looks ratty
Love you Kylie 💗💗💗💗💞
Honestly i loved the look , Kylie , you looked confident in the dress. It felt like you weren't doing that for anyone else but for yourself ☺️
I honestly don't get why are people hating on her . First of all, it's her choice ... like , let her wear what she wants and secondly, how can you even hate the dress and the overall look , it's unique and so fucking gorgeous, what's even there to hate ?! 👀... And lastly, if y'all think your opinion should be more important to her than her emotions and her heart , then no sorry , that's so pathetic like WTF.
The after party look should’ve been the main look
Without the hat 0:51 should’ve been the look
Kendall’s lips look horrible
I love how she thanks her glam team they’re little things celebs forget to do but she’s so nice
I really liked the dress. I didn’t get the backwards cap or the Tshirt underneath but who am I to say anything. KJ could wear a bin bag and still look good
Love love love to Kylie
Kylie is so nice to everyone.❤️❤️❤️❤️
the tshirt ruined it
Kylie I really like your dress. you look so beautiful and charming a symbol of true beauty. I can't take my eyes off you Kylie.
I’m laughing here Kim getting hair done for 10 hrs , Kylie having her final try on and Khloe is eating ice cream
That shit looks retarded as hell…I can’t believe no one has the balls to tell her that
Kylie beautiful 💜😍
Really wondering why the kardashians/Jenners love the stringy hair extensions look so much 😭
kim tho
who had this idea with this dress and this hat it looks so awful and cheap😫 and her hair looks like she just woke up  Übersetzungsergebnisse  married to the met probably marries her and travis
Kylie, u are so polite and kind
She knew how people will criticise it but the story changes everything
Love the look! you look stunning as always Kylie! ❤
Every single Kartrashian is toxic 💀👽
Kylie your video made my day thank you 😊 💕 💗
Somebody lied to her several times
Everything was fine until the T-shirt and the cap.
Dude she had so many better options but she went for that disaster of a off white dress!! I mean she looked better in all the other off white dresses !!
Your such an amazing mother with putting your kids first you looked amazing ☺❤❤❤
I love how Khloe is holding an ice cream when her sister is getting red for the met gala
*personally think that she knew what’s everyone was going to say about the gown but she just wanted to honour Virgil and that’s what matters. U can hear from her voice how much this dress meant to her*  🤍🔥🔥🔥
KENDALL RING !!!! Did anyone see it ?
I like that she filmed her own met experience rather than letting others capitalize off it. It makes it more personal and it creates a different experience watching it because it felt like a GRWM and I loved that❤️ The look was great R.I.P. VIRGIL and I’m happy she did what she wanted to do
I love your vlogs 💗💗💗
https://youtu.be/sJFF2NZ1yz4
Why the hat ? Kylie you are gorgeous we excepted something better. That’s the worst met gala look from you. It looks awful . I’m sorry just being honest ❤️
I absolutely hate that met gala! Kylie you’re so beautiful I expected something better. That look awful
Did anyone notice Ariel acting like he was using the Kylie Cosmetics blush (5:56) and NOT even touching the product before acting like he was putting it on her??? 🤣🤣🤣
Married to the Met 👰‍♂️ 😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️ Halloween cheap custom hahahah🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
I love how khloe eating an ice cream.
I loveeeeee the look great job 💛
Everytime we just judge someone's dress at the met we forget there's a story for it .
Kylie is stunning without cosmetics🤍🥺
Why she has ads in her video? Doesn‘t she have enough money?
Thank you for honoring Virgil. Yes it wasn’t gilded glamour per say but I still loved the fit. It’s unique
It's so sad that even all the billions won't get her an actual marriage Travis is slacking smh
Loved the bts Kylie ❤️😍 U r a nice person ❤️
After listening to the story' behind her wearing the White gown, bow i love her at next level and her dress too 💖
Love or hate her... Kylie enjoys life.
CLOSE THE FING TAP, BXTCH!!!!
Kim: I'll risk getting my hair to fall out 🥲 Kendall: **sends text message**
I just can't stand the guy with nails.
Accosting Kris obligates her, but in what way is she compelled that is a way she wasn't compelled to prior to the verbal encounter?
Big fan I'm from india 🤍🤍 love love
Kylie is young and having fun with fashion. The last few years, she’s been doing in on the red carpet at the MET. She’s been there and done ✔️ that and this year she decided to do a sentimental theme honoring someone who was near and dear to her.  It matters how Kylie feels in the dress vs everyone’s else opinions about it.
I love you Kylie so much and loved your met gala look you lookt great and i want to zend you al the love from Holland and stormi is so cute pls post more
Stormi baby so cute ❤
Classmate mong tomboy na naging muse:

Look at me learnin https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmOcAjDYRyOFwKZfChC-SGd9XQhuSGQeq
You rocked this look and the fact that you pulled this look off in honor of Virgil makes that moment even more special ❤️❤️ so forget what the nay sayers say
I like the family vibe 😇

She should have ditched the cap and just kept the veil , if the undershirt had puffed long sleeves and the waist part of the dress was corseted with the same belt thingy material she had in the dress, it would have looked amazing  Also her hair should have been made into a halo braided bun while keeping the makeup subtle along with her earings the look would have looked amazing.
1.4 Milly views, like dang, you really fell off
the story behind this dress is what makes it pretty🤍
Don’t have fcking kids if you can’t show them off
She was aware but virgil is more important! ❤️
I’m sorry, but after much consideration I’ve decided Kylie looked stupid.  Totally missed the mark.  Sorry.
Khloé looked beautiful, yes.  But I feel like she would wear that to the family Christmas party.  It’s your first Met Gala!  A little drama with the fashion please!
She looks so beautiful and she is so humble to the people around her 💕💗
Why have a kid and can’t even show his face lol
Trash fit
Honor Virgil.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But they let her down by agreeing with that hair with that hat.  Too much happening in this look & nothing pulling it together.  Virgil is looking down saying “Girl.  Really?”
0:56 😭 stunning
I love how she values her outfit more- that it's more meaningful than anyone's opinion. As she should.
honestly the look is great, the baseball cap is just a lot
Lots of love from India 🥺💙
As always queen rocked the met💜🎀❤️
You looked beautiful! This was so amazing to honor Virgil and Shannon. The 2nd look was great too!!!
Wasn't she pregnant
love the meaning behind the dress <3 its so sweet of her to do this in honor of virgil
Her make up didn’t help her look good and didn’t complemented the dress at all 😬
Kim should leave her hair blonde
Thankyouuniverse ✨
Orange gloves and that gown was beautiful yoooo😍
The look with the gloves and gold necklace was too goodddd
Kim really dying her hair blonde 🙃
Off White  Honour to Virgil  Thank u Kylie 🤍
I actually think it's really fresh and fun.
King 👑 kylie... 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Kylie i know you won’t see this but hopefully someone in your team does and will delay the message…just want to say thank you for this. We genuinely love to see the behind the scenes, and your life as well. hopefully you come back out with a reality show of you with work and with mom life now with 2 loveys of yours. if not hopefully like some weekly series on your youtube. but again thank you for this. it was lovely to watch 🤍
She is surrounded by yes men
permission to listen boss kuh... join us for the latest video... the video is very good and interesting, I'm addicted to watching your video continuously, waiting for the latest video, my boss, I'm waiting
The more I see the dress the more I’m starting to like it
Let’s be honest nobody could have pulled this outfit better than kylie 💖
She could have ditched that shirty thingy
First of all the dress is really pretty although it didn't go well with the theme and she could've just styled it better as her purpose was to honor Virgil.
Isn't anyone going to taIk about Kylie's baby number 2!? He's shoes is Soo cute💞
Where's wolf?
people worship celebrities out there
You have a lot of money, don't you? We do not have a lot of money, only happiness in our minds..❁
omg she so pretty🥺🥺🥺❤️
I just hope they got their money's worths$35000. each lot of money
kylie's just so beautiful...😔💓
2:42 Wolf 😮😯
girl be wasting water by not turning off the faucet 💀
kylie looks like a deformed ventriloquist dummy
❣️❣️
1:36 Stormi 💕
💕💕💕
Don’t let lili see this. She’ll be pissed that Kim dyed her hair for the met 💀
The worse look at the met
Gloves wd be amazing
That veil is a baseball cap!  A little hip-hop hommage...
that's a mistake
kylie the least you could do to save water was that you could've turned off the tap while doing your skin prep! It is important to SAVE EARTH!
A bride something TRAVIS will never do lmfao what a joke she looks dumb with that baseball cap
You are so beautiful!!! Kylie
https://youtube.com/shorts/0dwWstalrCM?feature=share
I liked that dress
Kylie understood the assignment of this year's met gala
she ignored the theme like it wasn't even there
Probably closest she'll get to a wedding dress.
The fact that we got   a glimpse of her son 😻
You always look so pretty 😍
U look absolutely horrendous that night xx
I actually love her dress. I think it’s fashionable.
Love you stormiii
Am I the only one that loves her look ❤️❤️
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life74
Not her letting the water on while not using it.
I'm copying that baseball hat.... 4sure
And she was deadass too...ato just cancel the event the theme has been lost!
Hey Kylie, aren’t you worried about saving the planet for your children? Hypocrite!
STUPID!
I wish the veil was removed.
YOU SO PRETTY 😭
I think the t shirt was what made it ugly
Kylie: " Look at my son's cute shoes" 😍
What a life!!!! I can't even imagine how much fun and love yall have. Thanks for sharing!
Stormi una niña de 4 años, multimillonaria y se muerde sus uñitas🥺 en dos ocasiones apareció en cámaras y lo estaba haciendo 🥺
omg KYLIE U LOOK GORGUES HONEY!!!!
i love how stormi says , "hi mommy". it's honestly so cute ❤️
Super cutest Met Gala look.😍
"Single mom is desperate to be married to anything" travis out banging other women lmao
fire EVEryone who kissed your ass and said the Baseball Hat was Amazing.Bible
I missed your YouTube videos ❤️😭
i actually like the gown tho
I love how Kylie takes her kids everywhere 🥺❤️
With all that resources and network Kylie did not understand the theme.  You could have honour Virgil in so many other ways too, its disrespectful to Met Gala team.
Oi but I loved her look ❤️❤️I loved it I love you
Love youu ❤️😭😚
I love the dress. I’m a Tom boy and then the meaning on top of it. I mean it’s incredible!❤
i still hate it
Yess Khloe Looks STUNNING !!
This outfit is so BAD!
So many people and nobody told her she is not on theme...
Kylie's looking so beautiful 😍❤ big fan from Tamilnadu,India 🤍😻
The look would’ve been so much better if it wasn’t for the hat 🧢 it just ruined the whole look 😥
Who is Virgil ???
i love how kim didn’t say anything she knew it was a mistake
Since Travis Scott is not marrying her she took matters in her own hands .
Oh helllll noo
What a beautiful plane ✈️ Love 💕 the pink lights on the steps. Love Kylie’s dress & the whole design & 🧢 with the veil 👍 Khloe looks like Jessica rabbit, Vava Voom 🔥💋 Love love the look 🥰
I saw a man face down on the sidewalk, motionless.  RICH WOMAN > HOMELESS JUNKIES
Has Children with a murderer
Omggg!!!! it's so ugly💞💞😍😍
Kylie every time I see you I can’t stop smiling ❤
i'm no pro only a regular guy, but she looks no good
Nice content. The truth is, money is worthless until you put it to work. Successful people look for business to invest on and make more money.

Do people forget how much money she has?? You think she gaf what anyone says. Why do people think rich people always dress so bad.  Everything brand name looks horrible.
I know the story is great but that doesn’t mean I can’t express my thoughts. Personally, I did not enjoy the look. It is as simple as that. My opinion is my own & I don’t care who agrees or disagrees with me. This is not a hate comment because I love kylie & most of her work. I just wasn’t impressed by this & that’s okay. You can’t please everyone.
Couldn’t off white design a better dress
I love the look!!
Stormi is soo big and cute !!!
f the haters!! she pulled the dress off  plus the story behind it makes her look more beautiful!!!! 💗💗💗💗
When she going tell us about her baby boy real name ???
All the  kardashian what to be soo different in different way !!!
It sounds like she had no clue what the theme was.. wish people all knew about the damn theme, she didn't really fit the theme at all.
Ohh kylie you look definitely amazing in this gown.....the way you describe that you don't care about the people what they say..... That's make you so prettiest and different from all... A big love  from a biggest fan and India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳love yaa💖
look stunning
I love the whole outfit and look. I love you, Kylie. ❤️ You looked so beautiful and calm and cool at the same time. Of course, you knew the theme and everything and you knew what people were gonna say about it but you wanted to do it for Vigil so you did it anyway. I realised no matter what you do haters are gonna hate.    Congratulations on baby number 2! ❤️💫
show ur son
Linda , perfeita Deusssssssssss love you 🥰❤
Si okay quería honrar a Virgil pero porque la gorra??
She's so fearless to say that she didn't care about other people's opinions about the dress cause she wore it because of Virgil and appreciate his work. Love her for that
Niceee
Loved the process so bad! Kylie looked beautiful!
i dont like this dress
Love your dress Kylie🫶
Dear God,  can I be Stormi? Or another Kylie child?
my 1 ish random Q: does she have her own pilots… do they rotate… how does that all work out exactly? 🤷‍♀️
The hat though….
Ariel is so funny 🤣
😍
💘
aww she sounds so proud at 02:40 while showing her son's shoes  happy for her
Virgil needs to be there
0:58 is giving me 2014 kylie like not in a bad way. Just she looks like that but more mature.
This dress on display on the carpet was really beautiful.
Kylie look stunning ❣
Omggg Queen 👑
stormi is so damn cute and kind like ----
She could ve really removed the T shirt and the hat. The dress itself is gorgeous.
I still am ALIVE.
Kylie has her own private plane how about Kim
my thing is the hat... its just the hat that gives off the wrong vibe of the dress
okay but LOOK at how big stormi is.
I wonder why Kim dyed her hair instead of just wearing a wig
She looks the oldest of all them
Is this what you wear to gilded glamour themed met gala- “bitch, you better be joking”
Horrible
I really respect that kylie brings stormi pretty much everywhere 😭
I actually really love the look too
ANJALI WOULD BE SOO PROUD!!
Ginaya nya ung gown ni billie ellish
Hello
Kylie too cute and fine
Stormi is so well behaved & sweet...love her so much....i like that gown....so cool
Iloveyou, Kylieeeeee💋
The dress was ugly when it was first created as it is now. Sorry just not nice despite her reason to try get people to like it. Also the theme is released later so she always wasn't going to go with the theme? That's disrespectful to the MET regardless of her bought-out status. So many sisters were off-theme too.  She also didn't have to wear the hat or hair down. Way too much going on. Not good styling. Just accept you're not always going to get it right and move on. Don't have to always be proven right. Just not a nice dress. You don't see other celebrities carrying on.
🤍🤍
was Kendall the only one on theme in their entire family?
00:55 wow make up free she really looks like her younger self here, so pretty
https://youtu.be/FHp7PC16AhY
Soooo pretty omg <3<3<3
Killed it!!! 🔥🔥
La baby ❤
What a strange outfit
I just noticed the missy brittle hair Why would they do that
Aww so cute. I love it now 🥺
The story behind this look is beautiful 💕 also stormi looks adorable she’s getting so big <333
This was your best MET GALA dress ever :)
Not a fan of the hat but it was prob Virgil’s vision and she honored it
Gorgeous girlll
I literally heard “men” when the said 1,2,3lol
She looks beautiful✨😍❤ As always
without that makeup...WHEW
very nice
She was absolutely gorgeous 😍in that dress.
I actually enjoyed this
the Jenners n Kardashians looked horrible. What a disappointment.  And this is the first. They have always bring it. But this yr 😬😬😬😩😩.  Kim looked so stupid and having Pete next to her he looks like a clown 🤡 and sound like one. You can tell Kanye not in the pic anymore.
Kim coming in with foils is hilarious🤣😭
do more vlogs ky
The hat 💀
The hat was hideous
It’s gorgeous but has nothing to do w the theme
Ahhhh Kim’s foils
Kloe eating that Dairy Queen ice cream! 🥵
😍👰🏻‍♀️🤍🖤
3:31 haha i love them
123
i don’t care what anyone says about kylie’s look it’s not supposed to be for the met theme. it was to honor virgil, and this dress means so much. go kylie for even going!! you looked spectacular kylie 🤍
I love your vlogs, Kylie!!
You are cute
loved this look and the meaning behind it <3
I love the dress but the hat is funky fresh I don't know if I like it or not
😳👉 https://youtu.be/-j2wjjVlx6o
My birthday was the day of the met
No
Stormi is so pretty!❤️❤️❤️
Wow I feel like a terrible person judging this outfit when I first saw it. Now that I see the meaning and value behind it I find a lot of appreciation for this look. Style wise I definitely LOVED the after party dress she wore and would of loved to see that on her at the Met just cause I feel like it’s what we’re use to seeing Kylie wear but I completely understand now why she chose this. It represents Virgil 100% the snap back the casual tee under the bustier and making it Glided Glamour with the large ruffled skirt plus the emotions tied all together makes this look No. 1 in my book. 💖
i really lovee your look
You can tell she’s such an amazing mom
I think if kylie remove the cap and the shirt and wear with more dramatic makeup it will do the look
Kylie you look so beautiful when you are just being YOU! 💜
❤️❤️
The Pierre effect
Y’all are livin the life
Ruined the gala wearing that off theme
Lo peor de la noche 🤢🤢🤢
girl i do not care about the story you looked horrendous. stay on fuckin theme or don't go
some folks may disagree, but i think kylie is actually a good role model. growing up, i was very insecure and wanted fillers, but watching how botched her face is due to multiple cosmetic procedures, made me realize not to get them. Thanks Ky!
Kylie.... You are my role model.
I love the dress but the hat threw me off
WORST ONE TILL NOW.🤡
Hey everyone I’m just getting back into YouTube. I just uploaded a fart video. I got a lot more saved so check back for more. I make fresh ones every day. I’m gonna start recording more.
The veil is a hat........what a shit show
I apreciate that she take  time of film the day, I love this kylie YouTube channel love KY, I want makeup you im makeup artists professional 💗
Even tho some people hate her,but for me being a business woman like her is my dream:🖤
Idk why kylie was so cute
your married to the streets n u never grew up in them
God, I fucking hate rich people.
I loved the dress🔥🔥🔥
I am going to be completely honest and say this has a lot of meaning to it and it makes me upset that some people including myself thought it was a 'unique' outfit but honestly if it look good in the eyes of the person who is ACTUALLY wearing it, then so be. Lesson of the day, don't be so quick to judge and I hope u have good day, night or evening :))))
👌
she looks stunning
Kylie looks 30 without her usual beat. So crazy
L
She never fails to promote her products
Imo shouldn’t have worn the see through tee kinda made it look like it wasn’t rly special when she was honouring someone so yeah
OMG💖😩
Just want to tell you how beautiful you are and how much God loves you. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. He loves you and he'll always be there for you even when you have nothing and no one. When people walk out, He stays. He has always stayed and He always will. He will bring you so much peace, he'll heal and restore every good thing you have lost. If you'd just give him a chance, no past is too dark for the love of God. Jesus is coming soon. God bless you ❤️🙂
The look 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I like the meaning behind the dress (rip to him)but the fit just wasn't giving a snap back w a wedding style dress? She could've atleast gone without the hat
123 that oj's daughter.
Greatest of all time 🥺❤️
I think kylie's look is the best style for 2022
The dress was beautiful. IMO the hat was not cohesive with the look, but the fact that she was honoring her friend by wearing it makes it so much more special than any of our critiques.
I really love the idea of the veil hat 🧢 I myself am girly but Tom boyish at the same time. I would love to use this look when I get married.
カイリーすごく綺麗だしこっちまで泣けてきた🥲💖本当に大好き❤️‍🔥日本から愛を込めて💟  Kylie is so beautiful and I've been crying over here 🥲💖 I really love you ❤️‍🔥 With love from Japan 💟
Goddes🦄
I just feel like i was watching a tv show 😭 she need her own show
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
There always needs to be a NO person on every team. The tshirt and cap = should have been immediately NO!!
SORTY BUT NO!! U HONESTLY MADE URSRLF LOOK LIKE A FRUMPY OLD AUNTIE!
😂😮😮😮ala
Otro nivel la vida de las Kardashan Jenner, me gustaría vivir esa vida por lo menos por un día para ver como se siente. 🙌
I just love you kylie I'm the dieheart fan of yours,you are just so so sincere and affectionate for your work       You are just awesome 💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
Why theres a need of a cap??
💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kylie’s whole look was stunning. She mixed the theme of the Met very well with honoring Virgil. Everyone knows that Virgil was famous for making “streetwear” high fashion. So please, quit the hate about the hat and the shear top.
That’s all it matters ❤️ that she loves it ❤️👏🏻
Just so wow!!!
Beautiful kylie
Beautiful ❤️ When are u gonna show your son's face exited 😘
Y’all need to understand besides honouring her friend who designed this dress . Offwhite , is a streetwear luxury brand , the outfit has to also incorporate elements that represents off white as such the mash shirt and hat. It’s authentic to them .
We need  this type of content on the reality shows please
Real Kylie (her in the beginning) and filtered Kylie are TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE! Woah!!!!
Kylie you look stunning
I love you and all of your family but girl. That dress was ugly
So this was the dress for last year? That makes sense now
Honestly Kylie is not good looking with out makeup or photo edits and she white white, with her baby face
don't listen to the haters girl I love how you love the outfit so much aghhh
KYLIE did a great THING!! She honored an amazing TALENTED MAN WHO dressed AND BLESSED THE industry FOR a very LONG time..BUT HIS LIFE WAS cut short!!! KYLIE WASN'T THERE FOR THE MET..SHE WAS THERE TOO HONOR AN amazing. ANGELIC MAN!!! RIP VIRGIL
So, you're telling me that her think tank could not come up with any other way of honouring Virgil's legacy than dressing her in an outfit that completely strays from the theme of the event? Was the hat also absolutely necessary to honour Virgil? Or could they have atleast skipped that?  I'm not hating Kylie. But she really should have found another dress to pay homage to her friend.
🥺🔥
Kylie looks so pretty without makeup
why the hat tho
I think Kendall’s look was more on theme than anyone else’s. The 3rd look they showed with Kylie in all silver, with A corset and the silk and the sheer sleeves would’ve been perfectly on theme I think. I’m not a fan of looks that look super sexy but it was more on theme than this.
Stormi is so cute!!!

Why DOES SHE HAVE HARD soled shoes on a 2 month OLD BABY!!?? As a mother of 3 (AND older); UNLESS they ARE learning TOO walk..you don't put a baby baby in hard BOTTOM shoes
"everybody, thank you" yess queen of manner❤
I scrome I thought it said ur getting married
Love your video it was super fun to watch.  Make more:)
Love!!!!!
What's Kylie Jenner - Hair-(Dye/Highlights), Eye-(Iris/Contacts), & Skin Color-(Tone/Makeup)?
The fact that she say thank you to everybody after their work is so nice
While you were doing your fitting I caught a glimpse of your daughter jumping near you and she said mumma , I don't know why but that made me feel different . It made me very happy . May God bless you dear ❤
OK what is that lol
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HER SKIN  she’s so beautiful

It wasn’t because of the dress because the dress is nice and even on the catwalk the model that wore it looked edge and beautiful in it. Kylie let the dress wear her she didn’t wear the dress. And her hat and veil just didn’t do what it was supposed to do. Hat made her head look big her face was sore she looked old and full of filler the makeup with the blush made @kyliejenner look like a tomato. Her makeup was very blend. Sorry but she looked awful
La amo!
w
So much waste of money time and production for such a HORRIBLE DRESS
im so happy for you we love youuuu Kylie
Actually kylie was black but the make up makes her as looking white
Stormi is like 15 🥺
You did your thang as usual ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
slay
Damn Khloe on point!
Man it wouldve looked slightly better without the cap
Some people are not being rude, just stating their opinion on the dress itself and how it’s not apart of the met gala theme for 2022. It’s not cruel to not like the design of the dress. It’s better than being fake and pretending to like it.
*Am I the only one who is obsessed with the outfit and the whole look? I can see my personality altogether thru that ❤️.*
The dress is gorgeous. But NOTHING justifies that stupid hat.
My love❤😘❤
In my opinion, Kylie looked better than Kendall and her half sisters. The baseball hat was quirky, but cute. It seemed a bit desperate to show up in a wedding gown type dress, but she looked nice. Kourtney looked the most desperate.  Kim looked a hot mess, in a dress that did not even fit & a Jada Smith head! Khloe’s dress was similar to Kim’s used one, and Khloe looked better! Kendall looked like she wants attention. People are sick of her in sheer outfits. It is old.
That dress never gave what it was supposed to give :(
beautiful kylie jenner❤❤
YeeeesKylKissesStromi
it's so beautiful to see how beautiful you always look!  i love u kylieee <3
I JUST LOVE YOU AND YOUR DRESS SOO MUCH🤍🤍🤍
I think Kris and her girls all looked gorg! Thanks so much for sharing Kylie ❣️
I know this was in honor, But, I loved the dress, just not the hat.
stormi be climbing the stairs like i used to do 1:34
TE AMO ♥♥
The SnapBack with the vail is the issue not the dress 😂
Looking gorgeous 🤍🤍🤍🫂
ily so much
She’s SO rich, holy shoot
I love you Kylie, and I don’t want to tell you how to raise your kids but please don’t let them grow up spoiled.
You missed the mark & theme entirely  Love off white, Hate this look 🤮
The hat is on point without the shirt. It’s off with the shirt. She’s gorgeous as ever. I just have different opinion with the combination
Kylie and her shoes 💅
Kylliiiiiiiii😘😘😘😘😘
Why that ain’t even gilded age
GODNESS 🥰 FOR EVER AND EVER 🥰
loving this look on u
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💗💗
Honestly in a lot of ways I really love this look??? Like yeah I wouldn’t wear it on my wedding day but that’s not the point of met gala/fashion in general? There’s a story behind it too which is beautiful!!!!
Virgil Abloh
Has she done botox?
She is so cute in that dress! 💜 Love You KYLIE
Me encanta porque no sólo lo vende,  lo usa todo el tiempo
Stormi is the sweetest. ❤️ I wish we could see little man too though. I bet he’s super cute. 🥰
life of Kylie ...again please 🙏🙏🙏
At first I’ve hated the look and it didn’t match the team but after knowing the story behind it, it was a very thoughtful contribute.
Kylie you are so beautiful and charming
She should fire her stylist! What is that ?
No offense to the other kar/jenners but Kylie us my fav, she takes such good care of stormi, and she is beautiful. She isn't afraid to speak her mind, and she has such good style. ♡Kylie
RIDICULA😌
ooo
married to the met
This narcissistic egomaniac has children. What a bunch of delusional psychos
Kylie Queen =100% Kylie Outfits =100% Kylie Hair=100% Kylie Make up =100% Kylie Sexy =100% Kylie Perfect =100% Kylie Sweet =100% Kylie Gorgeous =100% Kylie Iconic =100% Kylie Voice =100% Kylie Beauty=100% Kylie Pretty =100% Kylie Voice =100% Kylie Beautiful =100% Kylie Visuals=100% Kylie Met gala =100% Kylie Stormi =100% Kylie Jenner =100%
Dislike the dress (mainly just the hat) but love the meaning behind it.
Bruh
I feel like if she just wore the dress without the see thru top and the veil without the hat it would have looked much better but I get why she wore what she wore
Wow levo you
I honestly really loved it . It was so beautiful and such a great way to honor her friend. I love that she’s happy with it no matter what
Beautiful ❣
i like your drees kylie
Tbh, the dress and the hat is georgeous!! I know most people hated the hat, but without it the dress will be a boring white wedding dress. The only prob i think is the hair and makeup, if she went for a bold lip and eyes urghhhh it will look sooop good!!
Kylie You’re such a gorgeous lady Queen.
Wait I thought you had a baby ? Where he?
I dont see her personality much so its great to see how fun she is now
Oh wow. I have so much more appreciation for this look now 😍 💓
She looks the biz fear play to her whatever makes her happy, she's stunning now I'd be happy with an ole bagger of a car I'd be the bis yep👍🇮🇪
The dress was ice but that snap back makes the look not as strong
I bet this is gonna be on the kardashians show
i love you
No hate but this dress was simply very bad nothing close enough to the theme 🤢🤢
Her relationship with Virgil was just another connect that they only got via Kanye. But without Kanye styling them you see not a serve was there from a single one of them.  Also you can honor Virgil without looking a hot mess 🤦🏾‍♀️. The beauty supply store veiled hat 🧢 was the detail that finished it completely.
The intention and story behind are nice…it‘s just the execution…the after party dress was beautiful tho
I liked the dress idk bout evrryone else
I get wanting to honor your friend but what is the point of having a theme if you're not even anywhere remotely close? The hat is so off point.
I legit forgot the has a son now
Okay. But why the fkn hat
I cannot believe that people waste $ on theses gowns. It is seriously ridiculous
your outfit was gorgeous
Love you more storm storm ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not the personalized private jet 💀💀 #eattherich
This is so horrible. Omg.
راكي عايشة غايا يابنتي😢
I could say some negative things in here but Kylie ima let you finish 💪🏾💪🏾🙈😂
Awww I wonder when she’s gonna show us her son I’m waiting 🥺💙
It looked really nice I wish she wore it without a hat
The dress is ugly as shit
Too bad about their caption lol
UGH KYLIE ILYSM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*"Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment"* 👍👍
Tanta gente passando fome neste mundo .tinha que ajudar o próximo. Essas loucas desenfreadas gastando à  toa o que não presta.  AFSSS JESUS VOLTE LOGO
The Cap 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol that’s hilarious
Whoa she looks like the real old Kylie Jenner in this video at the beginning
Without the hideous face cap it would have been much better
I love u so much QUEEN KYLIE🤍
🌹😊 Beautiful

Kylie is the sweetest.
kylie you’re so cute
Girl  you are butiful
My god dis girl is filthy rich at only 24
Stormi so adorable🥰🥰
Ahhh I love with the dress and i hope u had a fun time
When you wanna be married and wear a white dress but that’s not a option so you do this concept 🤭🥸
She needs a new fresh stylist
It’s literally stolen from bella h lol but Bella did it ten times better
So much filler in her face! It's unreal
In my opinion you were the worst dressed at the MET 🥰
Girl i know you're rich, but...Could you not waste the water?
The way stormi climbs up the private jet like its a everyday thing 💀💀
It's all her sisters hyping it up for me, make it make sense lol
How obnoxious can you be that you have a mat with your name on it going into YOUR private plane 🙄🙄 honestly 😂🤣
Why Travis Scott never shows up with her at that kind of events
Such great mom 🥺🥺
that’s so fun that they’re all together getting ready and stuff like ughhh so fun being with family like that
Kylie with a gorgeous makeup and dress but look at Kendall 🤧🤧🤧I thought she shave her eyebrows
The ruffled sleeves w/ the corset was so so beautiful. The t shirt wasn’t flattering at all :( love the concept— poor execution
احبك اموت فيك ❤️❤️❤️❤️
🌹❤️❤️❤️🤍🤍🤍 Kylie lot's of love ❤️🙏
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
historicaaaaaaaaaaa

Kylie is soooo gorg omggg
When ppl were attacking her for wearing that dress but I knew exactly why she wore it. She didn’t even have to explain shizzz. RIP VIRGIL
FINALLY KYLIE MAKE VLOG AGAIN
Who else here just to see stormi lol and that confused dress
Stormi holding her piece of bacon is great lol a true toddler
Kylie, I love your video blogs.🤤 Do them more often, You are well done, with a big heart!  🙏🏼🤍
Alguien mas esta esperando el doblaje de ciproshow
I originally did not understand why she wore that dress to the met gala, however, after hearing the sentiment behind it I do see why she wore it. I think it is a great reminder to keep being yourself and only you need to know why you do what you do in your life!
I love her so much she is such an amazing mom she is never a disappointment ❤️
lol
Its not Palm Springs haha its La Quinta
Eid Mubarek
Khloe arriving with an ice cream is me 💯😂❤️
NADA VER SEU FIGURINO COM TEMA, VIAJOU NA MAIONESE, O QUE ADIANTA TER TANTO DINHEIRO 😂🤣😂🤣
but isn't Kylie pregnant?
Las critica negativas definitivamente iban a relucir ya que su vestido no cumplía con el tema d la met gala por eso eligen temas para ver estilos de esa época y no lucir un vestido fuera d lugar y más que son la Kardashian la única a mi gusto que si se vio bien y cumplió fue la mamá Jenner.
J'aurai bien aimé être un kardashian moi😂💕🙌🏽
I love how she looks  she just look like the younger Kylie
Her skin look so clear and she has cute freckles, I dont understand why she put all that makeup on who make her look so old ...
Guys please come get out my latest Vlog 🫶🏾💕💕💕
It’s ugly as shit
Wow ✨💕💕💕💕
Slayyyy
This video changed my mind on this look and now I really am obsessed with how it looks and the meaning behind it.
Hi ky
تسلم ريولك
Khole smack Kylie   Sister hood 🤩
Someone even said “idk if you need the vail” LOL
The Virgil backstory is the onlyyyy thing that saved this look
I just bypass all the negative shit, and focus on the real deal😎
Girl I need me some of that filler!!!
Not the 2014 swag wedding dress
Imagine if she cared about the kids that died at astroworld the way she cares about a fashion designer
🤩🤩🤩
Why with the hat
Sorry but Kylie is looking more and more botched recently, it’s hard to see
Hate the look tbh but hearing the story behind it i have to honour it
Love Kyle but the cheek filler needs to go
Really love this look Ky! ❤️❤️❤️
this look was very well made! absolutely gorg💖
