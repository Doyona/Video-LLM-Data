What are yall thinking about NBA 2K24 so far?????
Fifas version of proplay is coming in fifa 24
Jesus is the way pls turn to him
I mean, i think this one could be like by far the best 2k since 2020, does animations and all that natural movements can really make the game fun, but we all know does "drible 24secs and shoot a fade" will still be in the game, hopefully they could nerf that
I hate Mike Wang.  Every year I fall for the hype. Every time. Especially when he gets in his breakdown bag. 🙄
Gonna b a good game they gonna touch it and make it trash it’s just what they do
I hope they bring back the lay-up to alley-oop pass move. It's not in 2k23 anymore, in 2k21/2k22 I can do the fake layup to alley-oop smoothly like Doncic does in real life. Even the fake pass before doing layup was gone.
are yaw believing this pro play shiiit🤣🤣
no one cares Mike Wang fixed the dang shooting tired of wasting my money on 2k and yet can barely play because when I do time my jump shot correctly the ball still doesn't go in!!!
Hopefully pro play comes to my career and my park
At the entire community; PLEASE have some self control and dont buy this game at launch. We CAN get micro transactions reduced, maybe even get some removed. But only if YOU hold back on spending your hard earned money on this next game. Hold content creators responsible
@joe knows, can you please take a stance on the new micro transactions? Either for or against. Trying to understand which creators are willing to speak out and which arent.
More nba2k TRASH
I wonder if we’ll get more realistic hall of famers too
Pc still not able to play with console?
Just hope the green or miss is gone. As a casual player who only play after work shii is a deal breaker
game needs more consistent on defense. I’ll play slight help defense and I’m drawn/suction cupped to the offensive player. Dribble moves shouldn’t force defenders to animate into an ankle breaker. Bad animations on steals way to often. Ball goes overtop? reach at the ground. Or swipe through the ball. Y’all made the game very easy to score while disregarding defence
I just feel like pro play is going to just lock us into animations in order to perform them and less free based dribbling..
I think they should bring back your style of play unlocks certain badges.
2k is sooooo bad. What a waste of money!! I wouldn’t dare try it again until I hear from someone I know!
Best thing about 2k every year is player creation never gets old getting in the lab coming up withthe next Kobe durant Steph etc
Sounds like GlitchCity to me…
GIVE PC NEXTGEN
We need take 2 to get the NFL license.
They never address rebounding.  Bigs have been overratedrebounde since 2k13 and guards have always been underrated rebounders.
2k = madden..."new game" same s***
Will "Bully" Finally work for Dunking and not just Layups
So Mike Wang you know what's wrong with your game and you fix it in the next Game wow
Ps5 players gonna love my 7"3 post scorer
Who do we all feel about 2k having a season pass which we have to pay extra for for every month for $30
I just want players to stop bouncing and sliding off of each other because the animation is uninterruptible. On defense, It’s rewarding to get those stops but a complete slap In the face when players slide you out of the way even though there is clear contact.   This has been happening for years! Players abuse the GAME, but don’t realize that 90% of it is just animations bailing them out. Can’t even play defense because 2k will just negate the effort.
I love that you don’t just drop fake news to get views. I hope that wemby builds are not  to boosted to much. This game for the most part don’t seem that bad just for right now
All this news is good but we need to know how the a.i plays in rec I’m sick of them just not being able to do anything at all   Ik I’m not the only one that feels this way I play randoms all day and if we get down 8-10 points people quit we need them ai’s to play good defense and hit wide open shots
You just addressed the main problem with the game. Niggas like steezo, all these proam sweats, no life comp players ALL RUIN THE GAME bc they exploit the animations/builds and the whole community flocks to it like a bunch of strippers to some millionaires thus creating another broken game. Now 2k has to come in with the patches and shit just goes downhill from there.
Lol so they don’t have any defensive Pro plays?
Man are the fans going to be boring again 🥱 ? They need some hype , especially in the playoffs
Not impressed.  Skip
I've got some concerns after reading those blogs. I'm not popular enough nor well-known enough to have it read by and/or be responded to by anyone of importance, so I'll just vent them here. ProPlay While I do have a little faith here, I'm wondering if many of those things are going to be locked to the specific player's animation packages. By that, I mean having to actually EQUIP those animations to see ProPlay play out as intended. The dangerous part to me comes in the basic animations, like 'Basic', 'Normal', etc. If that's true, then will people be able to circumvent the 'cons' by simply equipping animations that may have never gotten upgraded? Adrenaline Bars While everyone is celebrating the new changes to the Adrenaline Bar system where the defense can get bumpy enough to drain the bars, I'm not sure people caught onto the 4 most concerning words that I saw: "ON A DRIVE ATTEMPT." If we are to go off of what has been said and shown in the past, the game considers something a 'drive attempt' when the ballhandler angles the left stick towards the basket in some way. So if the ballhandler never has to worry about losing adrenaline bars due to their dribbling, and can only lose those bars if bumped on a drive attempt, all they have to do is keep their player on a horizontal plane all around the perimeter in order to preserve said bars, and no amount of bumping will remove them. PLUS, being able to do speed bursts 'across short distances'. Doesn't that sound like 'left-right' exploiting is almost being encouraged, as long as the player knows not to angle their stick towards the basket? If we go strictly by their wording, then I can see this being the new major exploit going into 2K24. Offense vs Defense Many of the other things sound well and fine, but isn't it concerning that the offense gets YET ANOTHER SPEED BURSTING TOOL (this time, during off-ball movememt by tapping Sprint), while the defense has yet to receive a SINGLE SPEED BURST TECHNIQUE after all these years? How much more movement speed does the offense need, while leaving the defense out to dry?
Draymond guarding Poole 😭  0:53
Now can they use pro play to give us everybody’s hairstyle? 😂😒
nba 2k24 live
is next gen coming to PC??
Curious to see if the first gen pro play is lazy for historic teams like the rosters were lazy during the first iterations. Hopefully not
Animations look nice but I swear these last couple 2ks have this weird white lighting over every player all the time and it throws everything off
It’s going to be the same game
Same shit every year its the reason they do videos talking or articles, but don't actually show you these things happening in real game time
There's no such thing as "new gen". PS5 and Series X is "CURRENT GEN", while PS4 and Xbox One are "LAST GEN". (As well as PC in 2K's world, because... ???) Please quit messing with semantics to try and justify your price hikes. To anyone with industry knowledge it just all looks and sounds ridiculous.
Your idea for takeover sounds dope
How about y’all add a fiba world tournament mode
Am I the only one notice that they kept showing Jordan Poole cooking Draymond 😂😂
I just want to here if paint defense actually works and if giant slayer is still in the game that badge ruined paint D
I’m glad your back
This dumb, what movements have the players been doing this whole time then??? You mean to tell me NOW 2K is including actual players movement??
If you’re going to buy the game don’t bitch just play and hush
I agree w your takeover system fasho
You know this game is shit when Austin Reaves has 88 ratings over Jalen Brunson.
Defense and offense is cool, but where is the playmaking ? Effective fake pass before laying up, no look pass, eyeing for the corner pass and passing on the wing instead like Luka, CP3 and LBJ… or just throwing a lob while in the air with a floater animation (could be right stick flick up, triangle triangle), to throw the opposing big off guard.  We want this type of playmaking for the high 90 passing attributes. That’s a underrated part of the game, and it is not being looked at enough by the devs unfortunately. Fed up with the basic triangle triangle, lob pass. I know about the jump pass X/Square simultaneously  but that’s not enough. Jump lob should exist, and all the rest too.
Are all these new stuff coming to pc?
Confirmed: Pro Play is only for Play Now
sooooo glad they changed the shot timing thing. every single non-perfect release being a brick was ridiculous.
I don’t mean to be Billy buzzkill but im not buying into anything 2K is saying. They butter you up to buy the game every year, just to let you know. Don’t just be influenced by propaganda. Anybody who knows remotely anything about business, knows that a business is gonna do whatever they can to advertise their product and lie to you knowing their product is shitty. I’m going in with low expectations about this game because every time I get my hopes up, I get let down. Besides, people are gonna find a way to exploit the game regardless so all the work that they put in for pro play isn’t gonna matter when the meta gets created.
Joe this is not exclusive
8:30 we"ll be sure to add it before its released!! @datboi_yt
I liked the green to make the shot, they just need to increase the green window slightly and stop changing my jumper speed
If LaMelo Ball is rated same as Ant all need to wank up!  Sick of Any being disrespected!  Watch the world cup Ant should be a 90.
Joe on the takeover you know LeBrons not the best shooter but when he gets hot he can shoot with the best for an example it’s more like a when you get hot or lock in you can do what you need
Just want you to know out of all the content creator… I wait for you to post. Your opinion seems more legit and not just for entertainment/trolling purposes.
Shit still gonna be dirt.....please bring back NBA live
Please start penalized players who keeps pressing up the square button for steals and cpu steals
current gen users : eh
Android na sana
Putting draymon guarding jordan poole  it’s menace
Man i just hope they add a reporting system 😅
Yeah I feel like this is for play now players. This means we would get sucked in the animation every time
I hate the takeover system in the game always have it’s not realistic if that’s the case I minus we’ll play nba streets
As a pc player does it even matter cause we're getting old gen in 2024! I swear to god this makes no sense why is pc old gen if its more powerful than next gen consoles
I think the size up like 16 again
This look crazy
Ima be a back end demon again Xbox we lit again
Keyword = More enjoyable for all. That means the game got dumb down
Wait I’m confused is it green or miss for higher difficulties only it is green or miss for online mycareer
It sound like we’re going back to animation based gameplay instead of what it is now
Its all about blacktop and rec ball now 😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Get back to real gameplay.
Bro they gotta fix the shot timing like when you get a green you still miss that sh1t azz fix that plz
Yeah defense in 2k24 is going to be OD
I watched this channel before name was Joe knows. Og here.  What am I suppose to learn from this video? You’re offering nothing but a voice that shares Wangs’ tweets
Is shot aim gonna be in the game ?
Tbh this sounds like the worst 2k since 18’.  And I’m not sure how an intelligent person can’t hear that
I.must say where is the defense idc about offense thats easy. Defense
It doesn’t matter how much you buff defensive bump animations, until defense movement speed is buffed to match offense defense will always be the same
Isn't this what they should've been doing? Make it real?
Joe…you are a pro am sweat
I just want to know if the delay will be fixed for online play. It never is
Imagine you could use proplay on the my 2k app to record your irl jumpshot
mike wang always say the same shi every single time a new 2k comes out 💀
Now i have to figure out which build i want to make, thinking nash this game
I disagree personally on the takeovers, especially considering the high shooting difficulty curve
Why do I feel all that good stuff will go away in a patch
they have wemby
Jesus Christ this is all so disappointing. I’m so done with 2k that I’m literally starting a game development course in September to learn how to make games myself so I can make a better game coz they have no idea how to actually innovate
Choosing your take gives you the ability to decide how you wanna take over the game. Great idea
Looks recycled to me stop trying to make money off this wack ass franchise
After patch 1 this game is going to be trash again. Every year round this time, we get the same hype machine
you have to let go of your takeover idea, it’s literally the dumbest shi i ever heard. because you saying that im a 6’3 shot creator, and for some odd reason i grab 5 rebounds, i should get glass take? yk how stupid that is ☠️
Make a fantasy United States
I hope they add standing dunk meter for big men. Want to make a shaq build on 24 and that would be awesome to have.
I wish it was Open World Where u could drive to games and play my career with your friends and Go to there game to watch them play
I’m wondering if NBA Live said f it and teamed up with 2k.. 2k needs to get rid of the clay graphics. it’ll look wayyy better
Can we just get a game that’s fun they always make the game to mechanical every year y’all say it’s good then trash after two weeks at this point I’m playing 2k 14 or 2k17
I thought pro play would be like sum ranked shi, but this cool to ig
Madden usually copies fifa and 2K of ideas so if madden gets the pro play thing the game will be tremendously improved!
is current gen cooked
I feel like the dunks animations should be limited to a slower variety of dunks depending on if your stamina is low. I hate when people get clamped and get bailed out with crazy straight arm dunks or an contact dunk from damn near the free throw line with little to no stamina💯
games been so washed and boring since 19 im honestly not hyped at all, hoping they actually change something up this year and dont keep adding shit nobody wantsor cares about.
God loves you, repent and follow Jesus Christ❤🙏🏾✝
How does this translate online??????? Meaning a lot of those are bad shots
The defense improvements SOUND good but i gotta get my hands on it to see
Jordon Poole callin out Draymond for the iso is crazy😭😭
is it even a question at this point steezo always finds out how to break the game
Big men gonna be OP
Dope video Joe.
Nah joe this new takeover system is nice. What ur saying is trash cause they already getting a lot of boards ain’t no one want to get rebound chaser and if ur dunking a lot and then they give slashing take they already dominating on that end boost up something else. The new system sounds frfr
I feel like In order to contest shots this year, you have to time your jump, for some reason I think hands up defense won’t be as effective this year considering they are bringing irl gameplay where every shooter has a defender on them with hands up defense.
I'm just worried about no mention about the lag online.
Performance takeover’s a thing already. In my career, however the cpu is performing when they get take, is the take they get.
Its never a problem with the graphics its the dam game play and glitches animations hopefully it be better
Pro play sounds like it could be broken if u trigger a ''canned animation" is the success rate of the scoring animation determined by offense/defense?
So they’re going back to 2k16 type dribbling??
Pro play should not work in the park. It makes no since to do that.. your player is not a NBA player
If you’re new here. Please only listen to Joe knows. He only speaks facts about the pre games while every other content creator will just lie predict things
ProPlay going to be ass, then 2k25 they going to say it’s “revamped”
I bet a million dollars they haven’t fixed shit,just added more turd juice on top of it.I’m not touching this crap until month 3 and the REAL 2k players have spoken.💯
Still the “left-right” dribble then shoot is something unreal. I have never seen a real basketball player does that. Tell Wang to fix his game and fix paint defense
i dont like getting my hopes up with sports games but this is the first time im actually excited for a game
sadly its NewGen only changes
The game is 2k19 colors
Screens and brick wall will become big again to help hall handlers avoid bumps
My inside C will have 65 three. After I get my takeover up I will use spot up shooting for 75 three. 😮 Lolol
I’m probably not in the majority here, but I dislike the dunk meter. I like that you can use it to more reliably trigger a dunk instead of a layup, but it’s way too overpowered. I can dunk through 2 7ft rim protectors if I time it right which doesn’t make sense. If the defenders have the proper positioning, I shouldn’t be able to just dunk through them as often as I can
The blowout dribble is not new. They had  it in 2k12
But wont tapping sprint make u use a adrenaline bar
"With over so many animations, that we can't even count them all"  "Where did I see or hear this before?"  Turns over the back of almost every 2K box cover
They are still going to patch Defense so it doesn't matter lol at all
Lol bruh stop talking about basketball just talk about the game if you get hot and you play ball you do make shots you normally dont make fyi!!
Post scorer definitely go be my build
Wait no post takeover?
Aye joe wat about hooks
Deaaron Fox dribble style 👀
Sooo basically they brought back rhythm dribbles that we were speed boosting out of in 2k17 which they patched end of year and just now bringing it back labeled breakdowns
So sig size ups are back like 2k19, 2k20 🔥🔥🔥 love thatttt!!! Shot timing sounds like it’s more visual than timing 🥰 love thattt! Choosing takeover on the fly sounds like 2k15 2k16 W!!!! And new stufffff on top of that!!! Still not pre ordering but I’m excited!!!
What badges do you run you never showed if you don't mind can you show them?
2k needs to stop making 2k every year and make it f2p just like league of legends. Instead of champions you can unlock nba players or entire teams depending on game mode. 5v5 will be individual players throughout time and just like LoL you can ban and see who everyone picks to create balanced matchups. Could easily set overall limit not allowing team to pick more than 2-3 superstars per team.
So since they are recording them straight out of the game. How far back are they going👀👀. Like Wilt era, Jordan Era? Just a question
I can see the defense getting stuck in animations reacting to the proplay moves
Not gonna lie dribbling is gonna be broken 😅
🔥🔥🔥
Only YouTuber we trust
I pray they change some things like even rec. please allow to kick smb
Hearing Mike wang say ball handlers will have a hard time breaking free against great defenders is music to my ears just hope it ain’t cap
I can already sense this game is finna be a fat L
The improved adrenaline bars sound amazing!
dats too much to use for the stick man
I wanna see a pg do some hot moves & we all tweet pro play 😭 to get the move in the game 😊
kyrie's Pro play Animation going to be tufffff ‼️😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
So can the dribble heads stop crying now that adrenaline doesn’t effect it anymore?
The Melo/Kobe style has been neglected these past few years. I hope we get a little more love.
The shot timing visual cue is something I’ve been asking for since 2k16
Bring back adaptive ai
can i get a tech this year
The part about tapping r2 and speed boost, I already do that as it feels realistic to how irl players play like. Only just I don’t get a speeding boost but glad it’s in the game now so i don’t feel like I’m wasting shot clock
Only Chris smoove and joe knows can be trusted with 2k news🫡
Will the shot tendencies be fixed? That’s the real question lol
so dribbling is completely dead and the post lock 2k19 meta is coming back for 24. Lovely
Say what you want about 2K, at least they TRY to improve the game and make it more skill-based and simulation-based... unlike EA. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The same way Madden fell, to worried about how it looks and feels and not worried about the actual gameplay, slow pace basketball is not fun. When you hear basketball you think of hyper and people ready to prove themselves or others that they number 1. Not everyone with the ability to do everything, makes it so dunking is not longer a highlight but more of an necessity. Untill I see shot creators actually play there role and not dunk on everyone, or a Center being able to get sharp takeover with a 76 3pt shot, then.thr game would be how it used to be "fun"
Bumping the defender and the guard loses adrenaline might be op asf for locks ngl
Ngl this shii fire 🔥
So far how I feel about the game in my opinion…..look trash and look like the players sliding in the trailer. But that’s me I’m not excited about it
Kd and curry finally getting new jumpers
The game looks good so far hopefully 2k doesn’t change the game in the 2nd week because of some of y’all complaining
2k always look clean for the most part, would like to see even more gameplay though to give a full judgement. However Jo what have you thought about making so far?
All the news is reminding me of 2k19
Green or miss 😂😂😂damn
no matter what they do for dribblers steezo will find a way to break it
I like this is the change we needed hopefully it goes well I have high hopes
I hope it actually gets you open otherwise left right cheese will still be a thing
ProPlay is just FieldSense again
I'm always ready for 2k to drop no matter how anyone else feels about it. I started off playing games like Jordan vs Bird, NBA Showdown, Charles Barkley Shut Up And Jam and so much more. As long as it's a well balanced game on offense and defense I won't have any complaints
I do like your take on takeovers but at the same time realistically people getting a shooting takeover after dunking sounds normal because players like Lebron will go on a hot streak and then decide to take shots from outside and you could say he popped takeover 🤷🏾‍♂️
Him and badgeplug my guys 💯💯‼️
What he’s saying sound nice but I’m not getting my hopes up until I get hands on with it.
Ihope pro pray only works for REAL ONLINE PLAY WITH REAL TEAMS NOT PARK
2k23 already had "motion style" it was attached to myteam cards one of the hidden animations
So NBA LIVE 2k24 ? Sweet 🥲
2k23 will go down as the worst dribbling 2k ever.
I scrolled over a lot of YouTubers to get some real information
2k lockdown might actually be Fun this year 👀👀
You expect animations that aren’t as good as each other to be in the same level? Ofc there’s gonna be animations better than other ones bc there’s players that do things better than others
The defense is my only concern. I have a build on nba 2k23. He is 6’10” with 99 block and a 90 strength yet I rarely get a block. I feel like it should be logical. If the dunker only haves a 90 dunking rating and the blocker haves a 99 blocking rating I think the blocker should block the dunk instead of getting dunked on.
Hmm interesting "IF" he focuses  and stays solid on showing defense love it could b good. Shooting cue selection is a plus becus its realistic.. pro play can work as long as they dont limit dribbljng to height to much ex. 6'10 kd build should b able to get kd animations. Smart showing more love to layups.. i like the focus on strength and weight impact. The breakdowns can work depending how the impact of attributes like spd and acceleration opposed to just badges (quick 1st step)  Smart move changing the adrenaline boosts slashers gonna love this...
Why Mike Wang acting like he played even 1 min of basketball in real life. You know dude never touched a ball
i like how they changed the direction from only up down to down and up on the contact dunks
I want instant greens back. The splash was much more enjoyable than having to wait 3 hours before you see if it's green or not
Just cop 24 when it becomes free because the games gonna flop like every year and it's gonna eventually be free and keep playing 23 until then
Dunk meter coming back is crazy lol.
Why do they always have to add some kind of adrenaline boost.. ether you sprint or you jog..
Will I be able to hop on players chest like Draymond……I’m only kidding. Don’t add that.
Imagine those Draymond animations lol. Better watch out.
I already know my joe is on the job
Dunk meter is back 👎🏽
i agree with the takeover. you should not get to choose which takeover you got and like u said if u 4/4 from three you automatically should get shooting takeover. now if you shoot 4/4 AND get 6 assists then you should get both playmaking and shooting takeover
I hope 2k make our myplayer play for national team and can play for fiba and olympics so my country can beat team U.S.A in 2k
its going to be the same thing, but the people love it
That’s dope !! Can’t wait to play the game
Why is KD still on the Nets and they changed Jordan Poole to his correct team in the game?
There was a NBA live that did this years ago
What counts as “competitive gamemode” is it park, pro am, rec, stage? They need to be more specific.
0:43 they knew what they were doing 😂😂😂
Remove the adrenaline boost and it will be skilled based
JOE KNOWS
I like the duel takeover. Vince Carter could dunk and shoot
I hope they fixed the contest where if someone is just standing there no hands up it’s a yellow contest, and missing layups cause someone just standing in front of you ts is retarted and not real ball
Love pro play....adrenaline boost change sounds like 2 words...play sharp lol bump someone 3 times and have a shooting penalty may not matter as much for a sharp with badges and a high 3 rating so there might be cheese there....pretty sure it will be lol...then I agree the takeover change is cool in theory but could be very cheesy to be able to choose anything on the fly. This all sounds fun but sounds like it's clearer path to meta this yr even though they are trying to create freedom to be different.
I'm worried if someone on offense activates one of those animations the defense will get forces into same animation. Just like the kd clip shows. A good defender could have a chance of contesting that.
Last year euros and hop steps were completely dead so I'm hoping that he's serious about improvements.
10:25 Ik I’m not the only that peeped how they had Fox doing a floater on Deandre Ayton on the suns, where the hell did Aaron Gordon come from when he’s playing for the Nuggets😂😂 .. they swapped a whole new team against the kings🤦🏾‍♂️
Just remove adrenaline please its not real basketball
I’ve never hit  an and 1 3 pointer on quick match online and i have about 1500 games played 😭 they always miss the shot
i wanna see how these canned animation’s work and if mofos gon cheese em  fuck looming realistic hows the damn gameplay
Joe bro !! Can we get a few more reactions before 2k24 ?
aye you the only one that decent. mofos over hyping
They need to fix AIs online. When someone quits or lags out in REC, the other team just abuses step backs
Ppl still gone be dribbling for hours…
I’m so fucking ready
I hope they shoot exactly how they do in real life. 2k23 had kd and cp3 jumpers way too slow.
What if they allowed us to eventually upload a video of us performing a jump shot and it could be digitized into the game like pro play now, that is next level evolution and the next step of of immersion for 2K 🤘
double take is ass, how am i supposed to get double take if it takes so fucking long to get
Jordan Poole calling out Draymond for a 1v1 in the trailer is WILD 😭
Basically shot visual cue is when to release ur shot in a shooting animation. I need a gameplay example to fully understand
Pro play looks like it’s gonna get boring fast if it’s too realistic
Signature movement should also capture negatives. So if you have low perimeter defense you get harden defensive style with lazy swipes at the ball. Or if you stop moving too long its harder to start moving again.
Thank you
finally bigs aren't nerfed into the floor on defense 😭
Post/lock gonna be the new meta again 😢
Can’t wait to start taunting with Shawn Kemps Dunk animations
Great video. I'm looking forward to getting back into the game. It sounds like they are making a strong attempt to making the game balanced. Dribblers can keep on dribbling without losing adrenaline, but defenders are rewards for getting body up animations and beating the offensive player to the spot. And it finally seems like strength will actually matter.
I still don't buy it looking that good in actual gameplay 2k has already shown something like that with the jordan moments opening gameplay rendering his shot against Utah jazz . Fifa used in match footage for realism and its  gameplay is dogshit but thats a different game with a different engine by a different company
Havent finished yet, but offense getting faster than it already is makes me sad 😭  Edit: improved body up feature? We'll see, heard that before
Yeah…this game should’ve stayed in the studio I’m officially done with 2k
Defense
The 🐐 is back!
They will probably have running, walking and contact animation packages for certain players
Did I just hear easy burst of speed for easy rim running ?
Man joe you need to post more fam it’s been tuff without you, you one of the only creators I watch
Hopefully overdribling isn’t in the game
They need to add some sort of skill based matchmaking to game modes like pro am and rec. I am sick of playing with a below .500 record and going up against kids with 100+ wins and less than 20 losses.
Hopefully directional steal will stop people from snatching the ball out of mid air everytime I try to throw a pass 😂😂
2k19 Dribble style☄️🔥🔥
Adrenaline boosts look legit ready to make a toxic lock this year
Sound good so far
I wonder what they do for certain ppl animations that they don’t do irl for example ive have never seen russ shoot a fadeaway
looking like a must cop
This game is looking great
They should have used the shot kyrie hit over curry
Bro do not listen to this shit. They’re just doing the same things madden does with marketing speak. All it is is a few added canned animations which they add a gimmicky fancy name to. It’s nothing new.
The shot timing cues are a good idea. But just like with anything it comes down to execution. Does one cue get more broken and overpowered than the others
Seems like Big W .. 🎉 we shall see
Hope ain’t no safe dunks in 24
This a dream come true quick game was bullshit because I can’t remember every shot
Is pro play its own separate mode or are these animations in quick play, rec, etc…??? I’m confused
I don't like getting hype for 2k but it really feels like this year might be good
Is proplay only gonna be seen in next gen??
Hope it works like they hope it will .. that will be the biggest thing.
Joe I can’t wait for your builds I’m Trying to start the game and make Newly Hall of Famer DWade I would really appreciate it you made him
This is the first time I am actually excited for a 2k because of the animations. You could get absolutely sold out of a game because of a bad animation but if the animations become more smooth from actual games and plays this makes me excited for gameplay. Hopefully it’s still smooth and not left right and super glitchy moves. I like shiftiness not glitchiness
Bro if your locked in these proplay animations on defense it’s going to be hard to play the game
That Paul George tween tween snatch look so clean 😮‍💨
🚀
It’s 2024 this game should look like real life at this point
Game speed animations
Literally just told my homie this cause he asked me what is like if you watched the trailer you a see exactly what it is😂
That shot over draymond with Jordan Poole is funny to me 😂 but great video Joe
One day we gonna be able to mocap our own jump shots lol. I can’t wait my shi 🧈
