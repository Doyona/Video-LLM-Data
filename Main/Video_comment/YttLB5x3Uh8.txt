Why who did i get ad  said you're watching a game theory video what the freak
old intro still hitting different  🗿
0:21.... masterpiece, absolutely cinema!
My theory for the 'Don't take another life from me':  We know that Banban's genome donor was Adam Uthman, and Adam was close to Weverly Mason. In the player's child's notes, they mention Mason hating Stinger Flynn for some reason. What if Stinger did something to Weverly while he was being tested? In chapter 2, we see a tally chart of Zaps, Handshakes, and Slaps, and we know his stings are powerful. He also has pretty impressive physical strength, so what if Weverly Mason was one of the ones who was slapped or zapped by him? Now, Banban thinks he is Uthman, so I think he hates Stinger Flynn because, in Uthman's memory, Stinger hurt Mason, who was the genome donor for Banbaleena, who is technically Banban's partner.
2025 🤣😂😅🥹😁😄😃😀😕😟😔☹️😣😖😢😭
Hey, I was born in 2011
Tom was the only good replacement. I couldnt stomach the other channels after he left
Bro banban is utman💀
That's not Nabnab 7:50
why did they even remove the old intro before
Isn’t the bus Gus from choo choo charles
Ok I see this a lot and once again, Nabnab didn’t get naughtifyed. He just ran away, and o can prove it because in the new Banban 8, you can find him on the roof undamaged. And he didn’t find him in the fight with Jumbo Josh
Im back in 2025, it was good while it lasted 😔
na it was flambo in the dreams
1:08
Tom is alright, but MatPat just can’t be replaced
2:59 bro it's choo choo Charles he's in the metaverse WHAT'S NEXT
2:08 they were but you find them in the eighth installment
We are probably flumbo
HE IS BAAAAAAAAAACK
Man... Coming back to this... It feels like it has been way longer then a year 😅 while Tom is doing a god job I miss matpat.... I really do....
Been watching since 2013 after my father passed away and your channel has made me a better person and I that you for that matt, God bless and good luck in your endeavors 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Stinger Flin: I may not have a brain gentlemen, but I have an idea. The Idea: Step One; Kidnap the Children, Step Two; ??? Step Three; Freedom!:D
7:50 no, that's nabnaleena
When you leave I can’t watch your vids if the legend isn’t the host
🫡🫡🫡
The old intro
How would zulphus be the other character if we see him in the distance?
Is it weird i come back to this video just for the intro?😂
I love the intro thanks matpat):
15:00 my opinion is that it was flumbo all along
Get banbaned
HEEE'SSSS BAAAAAAACK !!!!!
That was not nabnab it was nabnalina
i love how in the old intro u have the new logo colours flashing instead of only red for film theory and if you were wondering the 2 bottom slots were green
New fans watching in 2025 be like: Who's MatPat? 😭😭😭   Edit: I'm crying because my cousin asked me this....
2:42 the Choo Choo Charles cameo is wild💀
Back here when banban 7 and 0 is out I think we’re Flumbo  I mean he never met stinger,opila,nabnab or fiddle but banban!
Bring back matpat
I am woching in 2025
7:52 that's nabnaleena
It's been a year........ I still can't believe he's gone
We miss you man
Who watching this in 2025?
My grandmother told me stories of how the matpatatar kept balance between the game, film and food Theroys, but they all change when the retirement attacked…..
whos in 2025 wathing this realising that were flumbo
The POV could be The original Banban
7:49 that’s his girlfriend
I know I’m 1 year late but only nabnalina is mind controlled not nabnab
15:57 we are flumbo   gobb zero reveal that
0:21  is the best part
In the dreams you are flumbo,the blue banban
Nabnab is not under control of sir dadadoo
Banban 0 exits
Even chapter 0
Why does zophius look like a thing
11:26 I think we are playing on the scientists who wanted a kid and we are looking for the weird creature.
0:44 bro really gotta put "Ruining your childhood since 2011"
HES BACK!!!!!
That is the classic intro huh? Where is mario jumping? The formula? ;) THAT is classic intro
So long old friend
Matt nooooo
I hate these games. They are all shameless cashgrabs and they arent even scary, they are colorful and vibrant and in a Kindergarten. Thats just not scary.
Nabnab isn’t there that’s nabnaleena
Bro please stay I’m good 1:11
Same dude same
What if the perspective we're in is from Flumbo
I low-key balled when the intro hit
pov, adoption isnt good enough
15:14 "hello sleepy fellow" god i love that line.
The thumbnail... "Abanbandon all hope" was RIGHT THERE
Love the classic intro always.
14:46 we’re playing as flumbo/ blue banban
THE CLASSIC INTRO!!! Oh my GOD I have missed this!!!
Please come back I really love your videos please please please please please please please please
Choo Choo Charles in this game you get hit by a bus . In choo choo Charles it said something about Gus the bus
Bro what happened to.  I’m leaving?   I mean I want you to stay but was that click bate?    Edit: oh….. march.. 9th……
I still miss matpat and he is also gonna leave gt live soon too
The intro made me dance like never before
Kewl
To stinger Flynn request for us to go home I ask how good sir how? Cuz the only way up is busted do you know of a another way to get back up?
if u look at it in a way garten of banban is pretty sad, now if u replace the monsters with humans or just put urself in the senario, it hurts. the euphoric really created a masterpiece
Zufious Is me frfr.
nice to hear the old intro since it is still so good!
Is the bus GUS! GUS THE BUS, BUS THE GUS
i remember i used to check every day for a new vid and see all of the comments saying that they will miss matpat, crazy that its been 6 months now.
The classic intro here made it so nostalgic. Its so sad he’s leaving, but Im happy he pops in once every couple of videos
did any body notice that nab nab did not get corrupted that was nabnaleana you can tell because the bow
Goodbye are favorite person
MAT THATS NABLINA NOT NAB NAB MY BABYBOY CHICKEN TENDES beHind THE MASK SPiDEY WIDER AUSTraLian bindER pookie is still alive AKUUHDAKGH
Oh my god dude I miss that intro
BOW
And Nabnab Where's a party hat?Not a green bowl
That's Nabnleena
Matpats voice is etched in my soul 😂
Am I the only one who notices BanBan drop that Skyrim reference? "Hey, you. You're finally awake"
I also have a theory here is the theory during chapter 6, you hear a lot of the naughty ones saying dada or mama that here’s my Siri when the ball pit collapse and children were in there they died, but sir dadadoo managed to find their bodies, basically pulled off a Fnaf and used their bodies or souls to create the naughty ones for his plan to escape.
7:46 i cant believe they just used the gaping dragon model
Don't blame kinito for this, for all you did say this was your favorite game!
I'm going to miss you😢
I love rokit music
Just watching the intro makes me cry
I miss matpat
i think thats nabnabs girl. nableena?? i dont think that nabnabs under sir dadadoo’s control
Just watching Markiplier's playthrough of chapter 6 and MatPat didn't mention/know about the brief appearance of the child thing in-game??
I love rokit music
16:29 MatPat: They're talking about the puppet's green autistic retarted brother The next line literally confirming they're talking about Zolphius:
"Hey. You. You're finally awake."
I think the bus is Gus Gus the bus
Fnaf lore is long but imagine one piece lore or doom💀
UR BACK😊
A game theory.... ♡
Im thinking we are watching in the perspective of the missing child giving us clies that she/he is also looking for us
Its never the same withoh mat pat
The classic intro is so good, I think I am gonna use that with credit in 2025. Also, I do like MatPat and Tom.
Garden of banban 7 is out now
After 6 months of not wanting to watch you’re final videos because it’s sad now I’m going to watch it
Rip classic theories.
I just realized or just saying nab nab is the opposite of ban ban
*smiles in the corner* "the  music has gone..."
Been watching you since I was about four I’m starting middle school soon . We will miss you 🫡
I watched the theories when i was young and i actually was scared now matpat quitting was the hardest thing that struck my heart
Bro when you were saying names all i heard sas sir baguge and king kangaroo.... CHOO CHOO CHARELS 😂😂 that made me laugh anyways i dont look up game theorists i looked up matpat and ill never stop until it stops working... 😢 but these characters are weird ive never payed attention to the game only 1 3 6 lol😂not even the whole thing. the car one is weird 😅  the bus 🚌 😂😂😂  Dis the good stuff fr fr🎉😂 anyways heres the end of my comment but one more thing.... T-BONE AND MATPAT
Has anybody figured out wth a Garten is yet?
Had to come back and watch these
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
we miss you matpat!
BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED BANBAN WAS REJECTED goofy ahh reply for 14:30
Come back matpat please 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥳He's the  actually only theorist
Whos matpat
Brushista
Flumbo
When i heard "family" i though dom also took part in the script iykyk
I was waiting for Markiplier to play this chapter before I spoiled myself with this theory, but at almost five months, it's looking like he might not do it. At least anytime soon.
Is NO ONE going to talk about the black spot on Stinger Flynn’s head? Like I have ALWAYS wondered what that was, including jumbo’s “red” on his left fist even tho the characters blood is green, so how can he have red blood if no one apart from us has it? And he almost never kills us with his left fist, IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE IN THE KINDERGARTEN WITH US? OUR KIDSSSSS???!
0:43  “RUINING YOUR CHILDHOOD SINCE 2011” never gets old 😂
Rip matpat
My friend thinks that garten of banban 5 is a different gameplay
I am not crying you are😢
6:38 so funny
I miss you so much matpat😢😢😢😢😢😢
wait dose he still run food theory food theory and the other theory
MAT PAT I SHALL WILIAM AFTON U IF U LEAVE I WILL STUFF U IN IN FJNTIME FREDDY
what matpat does not now that uthman is banban
Look at the thumbnail for one of the garten of banban 6 osts we can see the character that we are in these dreams im talking about the ost for the campfire dream, we can see that we are a purple character who looks like fera animations character, so my theory about it is gonna be proven in one of my videos....after maybe an hour wait no i think my lunch is almost ready sooo 2 hours? Maybe? Probably after i write this comment ill start recording because of my patience.someone please go watch it when its out. And for 10-20 subs ill face reveal and ill make a meme format with old and new pics of me. BUT HEY thats just a theory A GAME THEORY thanks for reading also congrats if you read the whole thing. If you did, like this comment, reply to this comment or subscribe to me
Is anyone watching this in 2030?
Why matpat retired from Youtube?
These are the exact plush character coming out too how ironic well exept zoulphias
14:28 you got the picture of garten of banban 8 wrong!
who is here after his retirment
fun fact: when we see the cast being naughtified, its actually nabnaleena the one naughtified, which means  nab nab is now missing.
What's Bowser always there
Who was surprise/feeled happiness when you heard the classic intro?
Nabnab was never transform  that Was nabanabnln
Peso pluma
Nabnab is just banban backwards-  Matpat: *slams desk* LOREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yea, all dreams are metaphors.  7:47 That is not true. Nabnab never got possessed. Even if he did, he's back to normal because of the events of Garten of Banban 7.
Plz GARTEN of ban ban 7
play banban 7
That's not nabnab that's the girl of him Nabnaleana 7:49
That snap Nolene😂
Stinger Flynn was actually not naughtified, therefore, the thumbnail is unaccurate.
Nah bro why did u wast a theory on garten og ban ban
i actually got this version of Science Blaster as my ringtone once... sadly don't have it anymore
Is it “bring a friend day” or “meet a friend day”
10:38 he appeared in dream sequence so he stinger's friend
MatPat, just pointing out that Nabnab didnt get corrupted, that was Nabnaleena who got corrupted. He’s still out there, somewhere.
MATPAT PLS NOOOO RETIRE
Imagine that the last Banban game is actually high quality and this series was leading up to it, and it was never about the series, but the next game 💀
OMG look at the body in die right there there die body like peter😂
0:12 YESSSSSSSSSSSS THE INTROOOOOOOO
Dude you were so inspirational I sad you are going to give your channel away but god has a plan. You are also my favorite YouTuber again I’m very sad. I know this channel ment a lot to you. Thank you for making my childhood a great experience ❤️😭
Am I the only one being reminded of the dream sequences in The Sopranos when seeing the car scenes??
Tom stop more r
I think stinger flints sounds like minos
What he left out in the car scene, nabnab was chasing the car not in it meaning he was chasing after freedom and eventually got excepted to find freedom
I miss MatPat and the old intro 😭
7:54 nabnab isn’t taken over its nabnalina there’s the bow
Why are you all sad? MATPAT IS BACK BABY
Wish he could still work
Did anyone notice the pun in the thumbnail, "aBANdon all hope" matpat is steping off of the channels but he still has to get all of those puns in before he peaces out salts
I thought you quitted forever
I have been watching matpat for years and when I first saw this video, I was very happy because I've always wanted to see all four colors on the og intro
No but wait WHEN DID EVEN THID CHAPTER CAME OUT??
Oh
UR BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
guys hes not leaving check his chanle
“Garden of effing banban” 😭 the way he said that lol you are missed matpat
Now i have to find someone else 😭
So nostalgic 😭😭😭
I miss ya bro
Nostalgiaaaaaaaaaaaa anybody yyyyyyy!!!!??
It warms my heart to see the classic intro back too
Why are the comments combining?
Matpat I love you
What’s the sound at the start called
wrong nabnab did fall to sir dadadoo
so where's the children
O My God I LOVE! The Classic Intro(
Its relisted now
🫡  chain
Thank You So Much MatPat 💚
3:45
0:21
It is important to note that NabNab was never caught by sir dadadoo, you can tell by the bow thing that it’s Nabnaleena
😎 0:21
garten of peak peak
Nuh uh. Im not in denial that you're leaving, YOU'RE IN DENIAL
I asked.
Wait their is already 6 GARTEN  OF BANBAN GAMES?!
Yup
1:00. why is skibidi toilet #1 on Youtubes most popular trends💀
My girlfriend bought me a lego build thats looks like us and my shirt is a garten of banban shirt looked it up and instantly knew what it was from the freddy vibe to the the poppy vibe but it was still interesting none the less
I still think is funny that I still have no idea what this game is outside of mats theories
I'm watching this right before the first theory that Tom is making.
So Banban is basically Fast and the Furious...it's all about family 😂
Ruining your childhood since 2011 😂
Same
8kk 8 M8 M8 8n6 j5 k5 j5 j5 n5 n5
Yess! I love the the classic intros! I wish they would play it more
that was nab aiena not nab nab🧐
I hv no idea wut ur talking abt but thanks matpat
Same,I’ll miss matpat,he was my childhood,but I understand his reason to leave,he has a life to live and he deserves to have a chance to break off from YouTube,I’ll miss him,so will all of us,let’s tell matpats story to our kids one day,so his legend will pass on.
NOOOO I JUST STARTED WATCHING HIM NOOOO-
but you matpat you got 9 in trending you made it
Now he’s gone……….😔😔😔
What if captain fiddles is our child that we were looking for because it states that he has toddler like behavior
it wont be same without mats iconic voice
The Last... A theory, A GAME theory.... Man i need  to whatcha just that now
I got a style theory ad in the middle of watching this (I'ma made a matpat theory or smth)
The classic intro😭🤌🏿
welp. thats one theory wasted. why banban
MATPAT SWORE
I told you Matpat is not quiting
Matpat ban-banned himself from game theory
These old intros looks much better than new stuff
0:20
What kind of anti-urbanist rethoric is garten of ban ban pushing rn?
Im bingeing all the theories at once  this will be sad snd great
Goodbye Mat 😢
Thank you matpat for being there in my childhoods darkest moments:) You’ll always be in my heart❤
How could you be Zolphius in the dream sequence if we see Zolphius appears in them?
I like Rockit music. They did total insecurity right?
“Hello internet, welcome to Game theory!!!”  Thank you, for everything Matpat. Everything.
Huh. I've never seen the classic intro
YES!I LOVE THIS INTRO!but,Im going to miss you.😢
That intro is awesome
TODAY HIS DAY😔😔😔😔
0:42 ahhh, that’s the stuff 0:54
Map I know who the villain in chapter 2 I meant chapter 3 of 4310 catnip and another side filling kind of Doctor got eaten from the inside of big controlled a turn evil
Finally taking the courage to watch them.. 😢
30 minutes left for the legend
NO! NO MATPAT! NOOOOO YOU CANT LEAVE USSSSSS!!!!

garden of banban sucks so much💀 i prefer poppy playtime
Me too please don’t leave
Classic intro? There's a new intro? Huh. Weird.
huh? i thought he quit
0:20 - 0:40 That was awesome!
Goodbye 😢
Btw I’ll GLADLY take theories garten of banban
I would leave YouTube too if this was one of my last 10 videos on my most popular channel
sobbing. I'm gonna miss him sm. He's leaving on my dad and sisters birthday 😢
It his chances live on
like youve been my childhood the theorists will miss you! i still dont know why banban got angry bc tentical dude tried protecting the kidsbro rampaged for no reason
I cannot tell you how much nostalgia came over me when that intro played.
The intro was so hard
I'd like to be (oooo oo) under the sea (oooo oo) in a jellyfishes garden, in the sand
Day 43 of saying theory idea the lore of gorilla tag
Not me crying over the original intro being back.
I hope the euphoric bros make something to remember you/matpat
The intro still slaps 😭
0:27 I like how he added the blue red and yellow for the other theories
the only nightmare is the fact you had to play this game
Matpat will be missed
ITS MARCH 2 NOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i got like war flashbacks from that intro. its my childhood
are the last 9 theories already planned? i wanted to request a dark deception theory but idk
How did they get the Charlie cameo? Are they the same studio?
MOTHER IS DEAD MOTHER IS DEAD MOTHER IS DEAD MOTHER IS DEAD MOTHER IS DEAD MOTHER IS DEAD
0:13 I literally yelled YES when he said this. My childhood. I miss this
But that's just a theory......... A GAME THEORY
Yes, I am disappointed that Matthew is leaving. I am excited to see Tom's and his creativity.
I love the old into 😭
MY SON IS HAVING HIS 12th BIRTHDAY BE A MATPAT GAME THEORY THEME to honor retirement!! ON MARCH 9!! Any suggestions, DECOR, games, etc? Any chance to get him a SHOUTOUT or message?! HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH and is SO SAD about your retirement but he understands!! ❤️❤️
I litterally cant stop crying in gonna miss matpat so much this channel will never be the same without him 😭
I will miss Matpat 😭
Missed opportunity to have the thumbnail say: Abanban all hope
I thought u left (just asking if he has come back I am super happy)
7:45 Lol the model is literally just the gaping dragon from dark souls
Will be still ruining our childhood since 2011...
Banban is dead
Do incredibox next
Maybe one of the final ten could be poppy playtime cause it  Already dropped
3 more theories😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
we have seen that stinger flinn has physic abilities,   what if he caused ban ban to go enraged.     banban was going to pass and be ready for presentation but stinger flinn took that opportunity away from him.
7:16  I interpret this as the opening day where everything went wrong. They waited and waited for their chance to escape, the day it opened, but everything went catastrophically wrong.
0:22
that intro made me so happy idk why
I love how he didn't even try to explain choo choo Charles 🤣
I'm going to miss this guy's voice so much😢
best youtuber since 2011 ima miss you man
It’s not the same😭😭
0:21 the nostalgia hit me hard there
Wait, but isn't the perfect child the deformed smiley face work. So, how are we looking from the perspective of the worm while also looking at the worm?
My heart…… I can’t 😔💔💔 the old intro got me. Not the best vid to watch on my birthday lol
THANKS MATPAT THANKS FOR THE OLD INTRO 😁😁😁
we will miss you mapmat
The emphasis on the “CHOOOOO CHOOOO CHARLES”
Banban is the weidest horror game ever.
MatPat is back?😊
Waaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaa❤u
I’m gonna cry when it’s march
I like how he said “Israel Palestine” was a trend.
I like mat's voice better...
I thought the game theory will say goodbye but goodthing it still continue
Can you make a Tf2 theory
This game is just so charming. The dream sequences were honestly a genuis way of storytelling without lore dumping. Its literal enough to be vague. It goes to show how ambitious this game truly is, and not just some random, poorly made indie game at the back of our minds.   I love this new era of indie games.
WHAT YOUR BACK
nice theory but it's tough seeing MatPat defending a scam game where the devs made the rooms bigger so you walk so much that when you realize it's the same game as previous eps you can't refund
we’ll miss you isaac
nabnab wasnt caught by dadadoo he's not one of the army members
The eye is here
9 theories until Matpat is gone
One of matpat last theries is garden of banban makes me unhappy ngl
Me to im going to cry😭😭😭
Yeah im probably never gonna watch the new game theorists without matpat it doesn't feel right😢
I'm glad game theory stays at least with a new host
You will come back, right? (Also fnaf reference he Always comes back)
Nab Nab turned into the gaping dragon (your mum) from Dark souls nice reference.
It can be a child
i dont see nabnab when he got mind controlled
ALL THE QUADRANTS OF THE INTRO ARE FILLED
WE NEED A KINITOPET THEORY!
I thought he was gonna end is what what is going on
Me too
im gonna miss matpat so much :((
Wow
We're really gonna miss u
wow 14 years 😕
Please Matpat Nooooo Please don’t leave us Only 9 theories? Why can’t it be 10, or 15, or 20. Like please I don’t want you to leave. So please don’t leave us here all by are selfs Pretty please Don’t leave Please Listen to me Matpat… Don’t leave I understand if you want to but… We don’t want you to so… Please, don’t leave… So goodbye… Mat Pat It’s just a game theory… Bye Matpat  Hope we see you soon🥹
why
The intro: "ruining your childhood since 2011" Bro you made my childhood
Do dont starve lore pls PLS PLS PLS PLS OLS PLS PLS :(((
Man is like technoblade
Can you do a theory on joyville I know it’s coming
Is that… 0:18 the classic INTRO!!!!???? I MISSED THIS SO MUCH! HELLO INTERNET WELCOME TO GAME THEORY!!!
Dont liv as mat pat!!!!!!!!! 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The fact that this doesnt prove that Choo Choo Charles cameo wasnt comedic. 😂
As a viewer since the beginning, the classic intro brought a tear to my eye.
I missed him
You said you were leaving the Internet!?
Join voice acting
Haven’t watched Matpat in a few months when I saw the goodbye internet on my recommended I almost started crying this channel was a massive part of my childhood so happy the last 9 theories will have the old intros.ill miss u <3
I abandoned all hope whenever this game was released...

Ngl the Ban ban gang is pretty epic and the dream sequence is so funny😂
am i tripping or something? why is everyone saying "Classic" intro? this is like the newest one
Matpat
U were my childhood mat and ur channel will never be the same with Tom owning your channel/channels..
So much nostalgia
Im still waiting for when he finds out about what slow seline says at the end of the hallway :)
9..theories left......
Grwat sell a channel great lose money great wouldve been better to just quit instead of keeping the channel to someone else and vids will always get worse
i cant see any comments talking about the theory 😭😭
I love how unimpressed he is about this series I'll miss him
We gonna make mat pat un-retire with the old intro🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Hey, you. You're finally awake" *instant skyrim flashbacks*
Its crazy the amount of love you put in those last videos.
Tell me about it.
So is he never coming back?
Nabnab isn’t nautified it’s Nabnaleena
Yay he is back! ❤
I love thé classic intro! ❤️
he’s gonna still have his other channels so it’s fine.😊
That original intro hits so freaking hard. And I know exactly why it's because we all love you Matt Patt.
Sounds like they need an Expert in “Beach” 😂
Why are you leavin yt🤨
“Running your childhood since 2011” 😂😂😂 I just saw this 😂😂
the old intro is amazing.
When he said we’re bringing back the classic intro for this, my heart filled with joy 🥹
it's just a theory, A GAME THEORY!
:(
I THOUGHT HE LEFT US
Stop making me more sad with the intro
Thanks mathew
I'm glad that they put the classic intro back. I watched MatPat and Game Theory since I was 7, so that was a nice touch of nostalgia.
I love the intro
omg back and yes so long year is you miss :)
Can you make a video about the lore of No Man's Sky?
THE CLASSIC INTRO im gonna miss you matpat😢
Wow only nine left
Who tf is Tom
Man now I'm depressed that matpat is leaving he helped me threw my child hood I'm 20  now, I'll miss you matpat live long and prosper
No it’s him he is makeing the videos
I’m going to miss you when you go your a big part of my 13 years
Hey, matpat, I need to do a project for my digital media that involves interviewing someone for a job I want to do. That job would actually be video editing. so if there was some better way to contact one of your editors, that would be great. Please, at least respond it would mean so much to me even if I just got that because I've been a fan since I was just 10 years old. (I'm now 18)
I love the addition of a the blue on the Simon says for style theory I'm gonna miss MatPat
I want you to do one more theory before you go, please do a theory on buckshot roulette
1) I missed that classic intro 2) i have a feeling the transition from matpat to Tom is gonna go similarly to dan taking over jontrons spot in game grumps. Skeptical for a short period then we will all love him
For matpats final theory he should use the very first intro he made on YouTube.
Why matpat 🥹
😢
Goodbye MatPat we will miss u
Poppy chapter 3 is out
By far classic opening is by far the best one
I have 1 question please please do a therapy on lord X sonic and what he is
💀💀💀 tf getting hit by 4 buses is wild
Please do a theory about poppy playtime chapter 3 before you leave please…
Well actually I figured who we are playing as the mother we are playing as a mother hence the papers that we were seeing in chapter 1 to chapter for they're all half mothers on it and that only means that we are playing as a parent that is a mother
Sad that your leaving, just know I’ll always remember and you😔😔😔
I’ve never watched a garden of banyan anything and at the start of this video it felt like I was having a seizer!
Anyone else cryed at the quitting vid bc i did 👇
All of us will miss you mat pat.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
POPPYS OUT PLS DO IT
"It's not beautiful but it's a THEORY" 🤣🤣🤣
i've missed this intro SOOO much
Did not pay attention to a single thing said in these videos. I was too busy crying my eyes out hearing the old intro and seeing "9 theories remain".
9 theories remain..
Stinger flynn reminds me of eren😂😂😂
MATPAT PLS FINISH PETSCOP   Like so he sees this |
Matpat i will miss you you have had such a huge impact on my life and helped me in the darkest part of my life😢
One down, 9 to go 😥
8 theories left...
I’m gonna miss mat
there is no way garten of banban made it to the final 10 theories...
The fact that when we see the intro with all the 4 theory channels in, our childhood leaves.
I actually like this game more than Poppy. Banban is actually way more coherent of a story. Also it doesn't take itself overly serious, which I like.  Also, my theory is that Jumbo Josh is the child experiment that didn't turn out right. I think the moon face creature is the female scientist (sorry, forget her name) and she's always in the background because she's trying to look out for all of the others but unable to truly influence the outcomes of all the infighting.
The classic intro tugged at my heartstrings
Classic intro baby
WHO‎ ASKED‎ +‎ MY‎ CONTENT‎ IS‎ WAY‎ BETTER‎ BUTTERSCOTT‎ IS‎ WAY‎ BETTER‎ THAN‎ MATPAT I HOPE MATPAT NEVER RETURNS

0:27 it's- it's- s-so beautiful...
yesssssssssssssssßsssssss thank you
crazy how matpat has been wit me for nearly my entire life. never stopped watching this guy, we’ll miss you bro.
Love you mat pat.. ❤
Uttp is cringe.
I can’t wait for them to cover Poppy PlayTime chapter 3 cause MANNNN THERES HEAVY LOREEE
😡
At the last theory matpat should say “BUT THATS JUST A THEORY the last theory goodbye”
Man it's sad
Man it's sad
Plz do a video on the lore of leaf blower revolution
Can I have the channel
It's only now that I realize that map pat was a very important part of myself 😂😂😂😂
Well… at least he’s still posting
Could Film theory do a theory on the gold fish commercials? Theres like 6 seasons and the gold fish even have back stories!
I HATE THOS GUY BRING BACK MAT PAT YOU IDIOTS!!!
Matpat, when you quit YouTube, I will never forget how much of a legend you are… 😢❤
Hey mate pat been a fan since I was 12 I’m at 18 😂😂 but there’s a new up coming game called the finals I think u should do they just dropped a lore for the story line and I think I would be crazy to have u break the case and count the fortune for cracking the case
What about cyan kid
7:52 if you take a closer look at “Nabnab” on the top left corner, he seems to be wearing some kind of glowing rectangle on his head. Notice how Banbalina has the same glowing rectangle on her head (which is a bow)? Well, I don’t think that is Nabnab, it is most likely Nabnalina since she ALSO has a bow on her head and Nabnab DOESN’T. So the question remains now: what happened to Nabnab? Did he even fall under the control of Sir Dadadoo? And if he didn’t, where exactly is he?  Just a thought….
I honestly don’t mind Tom but matpat is still the original
I’m going to miss Matt Patt but Tom seems pretty cool :)
NabNab didn't get the mind control thingy, he wasn't there when Sir Dadadoo confronted the player and Banban.
•Skibidi toilet   WAITWAITWAITWAITWAITWAIT OUUUHHH WADDUH HEEEEEEEEEEL
we will miss you matpat
The end of YouTubers quitting is only the beginning, more great YouTubers will be next....

We love you take care and enjoy man can’t wait to see you make Stan Lee like cameos in the background 🫡
I'm gonna miss you so much Mat! I've been here since the start. And the end...
The plural for of pancreas is pancreases or pancreata. There you go. And i'm also going to miss MATPAT and find it hard to forget about it... So I hope it's for the best. (BTW Matpat was also voice actor and actor for a few Songs from RANDOM ENCOUNTERS so he was the best.)
😊❤😊
haha yeah the classic intro love that chiptuney goodness
0:47 "Yep, I should have seen this coming." I'm gonna miss Matt, but i'm already starting to like Tom.
The beginning of the end.  :(
2:09 THIS REMINDS ME OF KINDERGARTEN and it's very sad because I dont think he will get to do a theory of kindergarten 3 😢
Is this ai?
Thank you for my childhood😢
@0:21  YAY!!!! They Brought back the Classic Intro with Nirre's Rock Cover of Spelling Phailiure's Science Blaster); and Even added the blue quadrant to the logo[TBH. . . I was REALLY getting sick of Themed Title Cards]
I love that intro so much
Tom is the guy you giving the channel to
I love classic intro🥹
Maybe it’s just a theory?😥
Classic intro  NEW AND IMPROVED
Ruining your childhood since 2011💀
Pls do a theory on terraria
Pls do a theory on terraria
Mann I hope this haters get brains and fathers
The old intro has finally returned to its throne
That nostalgia I got from the og intro
Yeeeeeeeepeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OLD! INTRO!!!!
It’s always about family
They updated the classic intro to include Style Theory!
You lied
Cried watching the og intro
I'm depressed at mat pat quitting
Gonna miss you, Matpat you were my inspiration
o7 to 10+ of hard work! As someone who’s been a theorist since High School, I’m going to miss you. You deserve the well-earned retirement MatPat, and you deserve to watch your son grow up! He’s too precious and cute for someone who’s going to be 6 in July!!!
his voice sounded so sad at the start
To uttp the game theory is not going and also i care about it
I feel home
😭
"Running your childhood since 2011" man That hurts
THE INTRO!!!!!😭😭😭 NOSTALGIA OVERLOAD
Don’t go MatPat!
Devil 9
I thought this game was a joke to everyone but I guess little kids like it?
Did no body see that nabnab was never mind control by sir dadadoo it was nabalina that was in the group at the last scene
garten of ban ban is completely dead now there is no need to maek videos about it
Not in this, but another one😊
Why did you say goodbye Internet?
Ah that intro brings back so many memories of late school nights
I missed this intro so much, thank you once again MatPat, we will miss you 🙏
The classic intro gives me chills down my back😫😫😭😭
Maybe Choo Choo Charles represents something like anger or rage because based of the games ban ban is the only one who goes through rampages and rampages are usually caused by anger and why stinger Flynn and nab nab help him isn’t just because he’s in danger but also because everyone else is
But the one that ends with the naughty one isnt the girl version of nab nab?
AHHHH IM ALL IN FOR THAT OLD INTRO-
Don’t leave us matpat I’ve watched you since I was 3 maybe even earlier
Matpat please dont quit YouTube its not going to be the same without you please dont quit please
welcome back game theory
o7
Totaly did not cried
I just noticed all of the Game Theory trophies were from the Xbox 360 achievement image.
we love you mat we will miss you
Matpat PLS DO NOT LEAVE AND MAKE POPPY PLAYTIME 3
I am going to miss matpat so bad😢
I'm so happy for putting the old intro
Last video that said,goodbye internet
I have a theory, if I never watch the "Goodbye internet" video, it will dissapear... Man, I'm gonna miss you
0:21 this made me sad😢
He remembered.
Yay! Matpat is back!
Garden of ban ban is basically a game held together by sticks and sticks
I can’t stand all the trolls in the comments. Get a life. Matpat will always be cherished in our childhoods.
My head hurts from head banging to the theme song imma be honest
And always know that I do love you and I care about you goodbye goodbye, honor Goodbye 😭😢😖😖😣🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😩😩😭😭😖
It’s very sad to see you leave Internet, I’m gonna miss you so much Matt Pat I love you
dont worry guys hes....oh.....wait yea hes.....hes back
Oh my, isn’t Tom British
Man i just want one comment that does actually talk about the video
15:10 how Skyrim core
man i hope with all my heart that he comes back every now and then to host a episode or two, it cant be game theory without matpat
It’s nice that you’re not gone yet
Welp after nine theories I wont get to hear mat's voice  (Right?)
The og intro goes so hard
I'm gonna go cry for a while
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING AGOUT IT BEING BANANBNABAN
Ima miss this man so much I understand he has to live his life and live it mat pat live it hard mat pat forever
I've missed the intro so much
Im sure Tom will be great but you will be missed Matpat 🥺
At least matpat IS BETTER THAN HATERS 🔥🗣🔥🔥🗣🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🗣🔥🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🔥🔥🗣🔥🔥🗣🔥
You don’t know how my face lit up when I saw that intro
9
Wow I felt so much with that intro…
Such a nostalgia matpat dude
If MatPat appears once in a while after retirement as a cameo, I will be happy.
Yes
😭😭😭😭
Yay we now have full segment intro
Oh science blaster, how i missed you
These bots are coming and saying/spamming:"wHo Cares iM Better ThAn MaTpAt"
That intro bring back so much back
I don't understand the context 😭😭😭
You know fnaf into the ball pit coming out who gonna do theories on it if you go lol?
so that's what you're calling the classic intro nowdays?
It's so sad to watch MatPat go. I know two of my friends who left YouTube. One of them came back. The other one is still here, but she's on Discord. The one who came back on YouTube, i was very happy. Luckily the one that left YouTube's boyfriend is there with her. And of course it isn't me because I have a girlfriend. But it's sad to see a fantastic YouTuber go. It just makes you cry because of all of the memories you had.
Your are my legend and you are my idle as well and I wish you the best of luck
THE CLASSIC!!
The old intro felt so nostalgic to watch
Nabnab was not at the end of the game.
I'm happy matpat will make Tom suffer during this channel
Hnnng... classic intro just hits different.
I’m on,g watching this cause first it’s matoat and he’s leaving soon.  Second my little cousins are OBSESSED with this grade o ban ban stuff and they want me to understand the lore even tho they can only speak Spanish but the watch YouTuber that speak Spanish and watch this type of stuff
CLASSIC INTROOOOOOOOOO
0:36 I said classic intro  *plays back to Ronny's original Intro*  Perfection.
We got this... but we haven't gotten a Lethal Company theory yet...
Were gonna miss you!
the intro alone made me give a like
bro matpat dont just dip and leave us u still did not solve fnaffff
Bye pat 😢
the old intro brings back the memories (': we will miss you matpat

Goodbye matpat we will miss you😢😢

0:43 "Ruining Your Childhood Since 2011"
His logo is like the infinity Stones being combined 0:26  Edit 1: wow 100 likes
I used to watch you sooo much
He said classic intro
DUDE YOU MADE A RETIREMENT VIDEO 2 WEEKS AGO
CHOOO CHOOOO CHAAAAARRRRLES
I would only watch fnaf theories but now I will watch every single one on every chanel
Nostalgia  😊
Mat is in grace hes going to regenerate in 9 videos
Poppy playtime 3 comes out on the 30th… it said on the trailer 2
Thank you matpat
oh no
After this comment, I meant denial that grandpa Pat leaves. The names of these characters are crazy.
We are all going to miss you so much matpat while I wish you didn't have to go I understand your reasoning you were one of my childhood YouTubers and you brought so many smiles to my life me and my siblings started making crazy and outlandish theory's that didn't make near as much sense as yours because we enjoy what you do we love you matpat I just hope one day that we see you again until then may your life be filled with all the joy you brought others and more p.s. the original intro being brought back made me cry and it was always my dream to make a game and have you theorizing and pulling your own hair trying to figure it out almost like FNAF it sucks that dream can't happen but I'm glad I got to watch you and your channels grow over the years I'm glad I could be part of the community I wish you the best in your future endeavors
I thought you quit
I'll miss MatPat like no other but, this video f!cking slaps
9
*Mat: (Plays the classic GT intro)* *Me: (PROCESS TO DANCE WITH DEPRESSION)* 🫠
same man
This game is bizarre and confusing
Tears started shedding down my face when I saw the old intro😭
I think that we should all do it's just a fairy and every video that we watch to show map pack that we still know him even he's been gone a couple of days we really miss him so we should say it's just a theory a game theory thanks for watching just Game Theory no not Game Theory but you know to just say it's just a theory so then you know that we all love him and miss him so much in my opinion but you don't have to but if you do it we will call it the remembering matpat😢
its actually nabnaleena not nab nab just so you should know :)
Imagine the last video is gunna be all of his momentous hello everyone welcome to game theory, and and that’s just a theory a game theory.
My life is slowly dying the more you mention your leaving😢😢😢😢😢
You make me happy when you post videos I again I love your videos when I was a kid can you please post videos again and please don’t quit
1 word.           *Nostalgia.*
This game sounds like evry narcotic in a game
yeah he's literally counteracting the statement "its not that deep"  i have no idea where he got a bus being a symbol of authority from but its interesting
Neat theory, game still sucks though.
I was wondering when is that next episode of happy meat farms coming? You did say that there was ONE video left to watch
Man the classic intro is nostalgia
THE OG INTRO WT-
The fact that I'm never going to hear MatPat talk about Love Nikki and how the blood curse propaganda is actually just a big conspiracy to keep the lower classes in check makes me so sad. I really wanted to hear that theory :(
Heh, darkest timeline... Community heh 0:10
Atleast Tom sounds little like matpat
MANIM SO SADD MATPATS LEAVINGGGGGG😢😢😢😢😢
That classic intro song really hit me in the feels
Matpat if you see this comment please please please do not let game theory turn into TKOR
Oklahoma "lonely room"
Well new era here we go
o7 chain here                           👇
Who expected matpat to use the mario version of the intro
He didn’t quit
AtLeast the channel is not the end🎉
classic intro slaaaaapppsssss
Game theory will no longer be the same if matpats voice isn’t on a theory video of his Im not watching it still will watch his old videos
I think I just got the final stage of brain rot
Sad
Ah yes the classic into
Goodbye man 🫡
I hate all of these bots
"ruining your childhood since 2011" 🤣

0:21
When are gonna come back to you tube 😕
OH MY GOD CLASSIC INTRO I HAVENT HEARD IN SO LONG
Bro when I see this I cryed
The classic intro will forever be the best intro. That intro tune is just as iconic to me as your "it's just a theory!" line.
I cant believe it😢
no :(
unfortunately im late, but made it!
The channel will never be the same again, but we all respect your choice, if I were matpat I’d end up resenting the channel for taking away his ability to just have fun with games
Ha! You thought I was gonna say “Goodbye Matpat” didn’t you
MAT PAT DONT LEAVE PLEASE
God this is bittersweet. I hate it
Average kid sucking another youtuber fame be like:
I’m always gonna remember BUT THATS JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY
Dude I’m still waiting for a liminal land theory
.........
It's quite saying that even this long after the announcement, I... Still don't know what to say, I can't quite think of the right words.
Okay but Nab nab wasn't part of the group that was brainwashed in the end but Nabnaleena was
YEAHHHHHHG MATPAT YOU ARENT GONE YET
I am going to miss you forever as a host but im not even joking. I smiled from ear to ear for the entire video starting from when i heard that classic intro. Realy gonna miss you my dude!
Im going to miss matpat :(
Not gonna lie, that intro hit hard
You lost me at "lolz".
I never heard of this game.
so nostalgic
I’ll miss matpat so much YouTube won’t be the same without him
No mf way he pulled out the og intro. That is amazing. Thank you for running our childhood. 😢😊😊

I just shed a tear at that intro 0:21
Wish you could stay, thank you mat, Scott, and everyone else we are loosing
Mat Pat I still remember when you caused JC Caylens death on the first episode of Escape The Night.

Ok thats a classic intor but not classic enough
THE BLUE PART IS REAL!
We’re gonna miss you
Garden of ban ban did not deserve one episode of game theory
0:25 FINALLY THE LOGO IS COMPLETE
Why did matpat have to cook the game at the end dang
We dont know what happened to nab nab actually because i think that nabeelena thats with the mind controlled they really need to make models a bit more distinct
I really wish that mat pat could do poppy playtime chapter 3 theory’s
7 theory’s remaining
THE INTRO 🥺🥺🥺💚💚💚
"Ruining your childhood since 2011" -Game Theory
I love the classic intro

You havnt been ruining childhood since 2011. You have been making them
You have been posting videos ever since the day I was born... and I’ve been watching every video of yours for 8 years I'm not ready to let go               I'm not counting the play ones
That intro hit me with memories like a fist 🤘
So it begins. . .
GameTheory and Matpat hold such a special place in my heart. You will be misses dearly my dude. Thank you for everything
I will miss you😢
Oh my god…that intro was so nostalgic😭😭 You will be missed MatPat😔
That intro tho
9🙁
hey matpat, just wanted to point out that the car explodes at the end of the CHOO CHOO CHARLES dream thing. I guess representing that they lost their ability to escape on their own... or something like that
The intro just hit different
😢
Dude that intro just hits different now
I wanna be the only one who comments about the video, so...    The bird scared me
Erm Ackshually that’s Nabnaleena, and NabNab might not be under the spell 🤓☝️ (7:49)
Thought: If ‘The perfect Child’ needed a CHILD’s DNA, and we are LOOKING for our CHILD perhaps, the DNA was our child’s! Therefore we have already found them, hence why Stinger Flynn would think our plan was destined to fail. Because we had, we just didn’t know it, and by continuing to search, we were jeopardising the chance for the other characters.
0:21
7 more before the saddest video ever
When you go, make a regeneration like in doctor who
That old intro is crazyyy 🔥🔥🔥
Youtuber's leaving? First Moo now you 😭 I don't want 2024 anymore

Yooo
In the ending of that game, it doesn't look like nabnab (spider guy), it looks like the girl spider we made from the previous game. Look at the top of their head. Its glowing a bright pink, kind of like the glowing bowtie in banbelinas hair.
I love seeing the new intro with the complete logo

Them bringing back the intro for these final 9 with all 4 colors complete puts a smile on my face
Goodbye you magnificent b****** you may we all remember your videos at the greatest moments of our lives❤😢 You have inspired us all Matt Pat thank you for being with us to the very end😊
It hurts me how much matpat can make stories like this make sense
Haven't even finished the episode and its wonderful. I LOVE the og intro.
Before i continue i just wanna say when i heard that og intro i stood up and had to vibe along with it. Ive missed that original intro
"Oh, matpat's first last video came out! Let's se-" it's just garten of banban
MATPAAAAAAAAAAAT! How dumb
There's one problem, nabnab never got naughtifid because of 2 things:  1- how would nabnab become normal size as he was literally 10 foot tall 2- the corrupted spider has a bowtie which nabnab doesn't, he had a party hat and now he's literally bald. The spider is nabnaleena not nabnab
Me too man          👇
For the love of god, will you guys say something relevant to the video?!
I’d always hoped you’d do little nightmares
It’s been a honor for theoretically gaming with you since 2011
LETS GO THE CLASSIC INTRO! I sorta knew it would come back and better than ever.
Hes back
one of the reasons i love this channel is matpat and his humor
The 2nd best intro for game theory, the best one was the one right before that one.
same
THE CLASSIC INTO!!!!!!!!
THE OLD INTRO 😭😭😭
Mat pat pls pls just listen eure pls dont retire im begging you bro i wont be able to handle it first lynja dies of cancer and now your retirement is coming dude pls im begging you or otherwise 2024 will be my worst year of my 11 yesr old life oh pls just dont retire
Nabnab never fell under the mind control it was nabnalina  Pls like this so he will see it
jangan hina lah garten of ban ban walau pun kaku tapi seru ceritanya
I still don't understand most things about both the Garten of Ban Ban and Choo Choo Charles, although some of the characters do look pretty interesting...But hey, this is just a comment, a game comment! Thank you for everything! ❤
“remember, it’s just a theory, a GAME THEORY”    2009-2024     matpat
I AM GOING TO MIS YOU I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SECOND
9 more
this is such a trip not watching the first part while zoinked
Pls be when your last theory come out, it be April fools prank.
I have a question I just remembered about the Ranboo arg are you going to finish it?
love the og intro
I have a theory: So what if we gave one of our genomes to Zolphius? Because think about it, We can understand Zolphius, he said sorry to us in Spanish(US), and when we saw that English to Español dictionary and clicked on it, it said we felt strange. Ik its a long shot but I feel like it makes sense. So maybe Zolphius took(lead) out child. So that he could bring us back to the Garten. So he could talk to us maybe? Think about it, the only times we see Zolphius are in the mysterious dark void right? And on that one picture we saw that Zolphius was singing to the other mutants right, almost like a song, so maybe he sang to our child(like a parent) to lead our child to him, and from the one note, it said that Ms. Mason doesn’t want us to talk to the big face thing with tears coming from Zolphius. So what if Zolphius is drawn to the child like a parent since he as our genome? Idk it’s just a wacky theory that’s prob not even true
The classic into
"Don't cry because it's over ,smile because it happened" - *Wise old man.*

Please made a Fancy adventures theory
Plz don't leave matpat your the best
He need to do an fnaf therory for the last one the,last theories,AN GAME THEORIES😢
The original intro
MatPat can you cover the granny and slendrina lore from Dvloper because you have never ever made any theory's about it and you only have 9 theory's left.
I knew there was huge banban lore, I've noticed it since the 2nd game, if the euphoric brothers really just wanted profit, why make more characters? Why make a story? I knew there was a plan much bigger than what others expected, I'm glad they did what I thought they would, they're smarter than some think.
Please do at least one video with only you if not well miss you
I just started my channel
🫡
11 years ago they were talking about video game nockers
When u remember   a theory in years think of the The game theory
The nostalgia of the intro
Bye matpat ill miss you😢

I'm gonna miss matpat, I might just start rewatching theories every now and then lol

Honestly surprised the lore and story of the fallout universe hasnt been covered yet, theres so much story and lore in it that a series would be amazing.
Remember! It's just a theory. A game theory!
I have no idea if I'll be able to accept the fact that MatPat's going to be gone 😭
Mat pat is still in food theory,film theory and style theory
One day matpat will be forgotten by the new generaton, and just agree that tom is the original creator
these bots man. Report them for spamming in the replys and dont respond to them
can the last theory be the Matpat lore?
I never got the theory that Lara Croft is a serial killer 🥲😭😪
Goodbye matpat a veteran of our childhoods
9 more...
Leathal company theory pls
0:26🎸🎶🎶🎸🎶
0:01🤨
Chrono Trigger ⬇️

This Chanel is my age. And it still made up most of my childhood
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😊
I’m extremely sad that he hasn’t done an OMORI theory even though he’s played it, I really want a theory of OMORI, PLEASE, MATPAT! MAKE AN OMORI THEORY!
I can’t believe that once matpat quits, tom will also create new childhoods but just not the same, and it repeats over and over and over
I dips on the chanel
He is back?
Guys lets hit 20 million subs before his 9 theories
Before you go please make Brawl Stars theory video
Man I’ve been watching you for like 8 something years man your voice is iconic at this point 😭😔
💋
It's just a theory, A GAME THEORY, thank you... Thank you for our childhood
I have been waiting MatPat’s older videos to get over him leaving
I will miss you so much 😢
I started watching MatPat when I  was 6 now I’m 13. In a way it feels like the end of my childhood thank you matpat
Man this sucks because I going to miss him
this aint the classic intro :(
DO A FNAF THEORY FOR YOUR DAY 3 or 2
Theory:the character we are is a new character named “sleepy fellow”
its a (kinda) small indie game but could you guys look into the lore of Mindustry, their is evedince of a story i cant quite piece together
This will be one of his and our finest moments
I'm not kidding when I said I was sobbing my bed yesterday. Because I watched his video where he said if he's gonna leave the channel.
I will miss matpat I wish he will come back :(
That aint the classic intro!
I wouldn’t be surprise if Stephanie Patrick aka MatPat’s Wife will be now Hosting the channel 🥰but of course I will miss Matpat😢
Bro😢 you literally started your YouTube channel when I was born you've got so far why would you quit now 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
pls don't quit plsss :(
Please theorize jk
The intros need to make a comeback after MatPat leaves. On all the channels.
We’re going to miss you!!!!😢
Yay! The intro got updated! The logo now glows green, red, yellow, and now blue!!!
Nothings new nothing new ..
Can it be my problem? 🙋‍♀️😂
Matpat we will miss you your the greatest loss in the history of YouTube you will be missed farewell Matpat 😢 edit: if I wanted theories I come to you bye Matpat
Gonna miss you
I will miss u old friend u will forever stay in our hearts YouTube will not be the same wiyout u I tell u now I am ganna miss u so so so much❤
I have been watching for 4 years 😢😢😢
You know I actually started to miss him so much because I heard retirement and just stopped watching but I started to come with my theories and I'm thinking of creating my own theorie channel and I hope mat pat See's this and knows that he has inspired me over the years and I'm really gonna miss him😢
i cannot bielive
😢😢😢 im going to Miss you
We lost a true legend
Please stay
Matpat gg you server our childhoods well.
the fact that matpats goodbye internet video was his 666th video was kinda wierd
Goodbye mat you made my childhood and youll make plenty others.
what if the last theory is a fnaf theory
Out of all the games you could’ve chose for your final 10 theories you chose Garten Of Banban?
seeing the original intro again… it made me cry 😭😭😭
I love game theory and its sad that mat pat is leaving but it will atleast still be running ill miss you matpat.
I really do have hope for Tom to carry out matpats legacy
I’m so sad 😞
I’ve been watching since there was only one channel😢
The intro gave me a chop to the neck
plz do a video on that level again series.. I'm really confused about the lore..
I think I'd like to see a mini theory that compiles a complete list of (canonical) Raccoon City survivors. I scoured Google for three hours and there is no definitive list of them anywhere (Capcom's old forum had one but it's been gone for a while now). I've been a fan of Resident Evil since 2001 and have quite a list myself, but I'm sure I'm still missing a lot of them
Did anyone else go back after the intro just to full screen it and flipping rock out like it’s 1999?
*Three weeks remaining.*
why would you waste your 9th theory on GARTEN OF BANBAN
ill miss u bro u were my whole childhood its just sad seeing u leave;(
See the og intro was awesome
Spam every were it's a theory a game theory
the channel is counting the minutes that we have left to see our childhoo
Im going to miss u matpat
I hope we get the OG OG intro at some point. I hate the very idea of this game, but since matpat is leaving, I'll watch it.
P.O.V matpat is retiring so you're watching all of the theorist videos even ones for games u kinda hate
I miss you get him to 20 million subscribers❤❤❤😢
"ruining your childhood since 2011" more like making your childhood since 2011
Please don't waste the remaining theories. Garten is not worth losing you.
I grew up watching this guy. I thought "atleast the channel will still have uploads.. BUT IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!!" That aside, I hope matpat will still make an appearance here and there on the channel and I'm very interested to see how the new videos will be.
THE OG INTRO RETURNS
Go see your family
Im crying
Matpat stay on YouTube pls your the only person who makes me want to watch youtube
Nine years you are legend😭😭😭
The last day mat is a part of this channel is the day im last subscribed to them.
Gonna miss you 4ever
Your the only reason I understood Fnaf
Ice been watching you for 13 years 😭😭 nooooo
Man the nostalgia for the old intro
I dont care what anyone says, one day or another.. Someone has to make mat pat his own undertale au, also... We will miss you forever and beyond matpat
Game, Film, Food and Style Theory won't be the same without MatPat, guys!
Man when are his workers gonna appear
Indie horror is not going to be scary in the future I hop not
Why not use your oldest game theory intro for your last Theory
This is the end of a beginning why does have to be like this
Idc I'm watching all the old ones with matpat I refuse to watch the ones without him
We love you MattPat, we will miss you❤❤

Ima miss you mat pat
Why... 😥
PLEASE DO A THEAROY ON THE BOOK THE WATERTOWRR ITS SO FULL OF LORE AND ONLY ABOUT15 PAGES LONG
Am I the only one who noticed that's probably not nabnab but nabnallena that got caught? I'm only saying this since nabnab was transformed, and unlike what we saw with the baby opila, we never saw nabnab turn back to normal. It is also important to note that the one here that looks like nabnab has a bow like nabnallena (sorry, I have no idea how well I spelled the names 😅)
On that last theory, we all need to see the TRUE OG intro. The first one ever used.
PNG matpat and the old intro I will miss them
You’ll always be a legend😢😢
Matpat We'll miss you.
These fckin bots man
Guys I think we should get him to say "that's not a theory it's a conclusion" on his last theory
while I'm just kidding, you're doing Garten of BanBan as one of you last theories? Garten, of BANBAN???
Mat pat can you wish me happy birthday on the 17th of March.
I NEED TO KNOW! WHAT IS THE FOURTH FACTION?! Game, Food, Flim, and WHAT ELSE?!
New game theory onwers go.back Matpat come back  Tom go back

He should do a theory about the new Fontaine place in genshine impact and love you matpat
mat pat’s final theory should be a fnaf theory, who agrees?
Imagine the last theory is a fnaf theory
IS HE ACTUALLY LEAVING OR IS HE LYING IS IT A TEMP LEAVE?!

DONT LEAVE US MATPAT😭
Sad😢
Its wont be the same without matpat when he lives
Hey Matpat. I know this is a long shot, but my birthday is on March 9. It would mean the world if your last video would be a game theory about my favorite game series, the God Of War series. Anything about it really. I know this is very out there but I would shoot my shot while I still can. Please matpat. Your the best! -josh
Matpat Made my childhood
Wait shy did that classic theory make me cry.... It  reminded me of when i was like 14 and me and my friends would all go to each others houses to watch your videos as soon as they came out 😊
we will not forget u matpat thank you for ur video theory on ur video thank u matpat
I’m gonna watch all of mat pats video again
Frist Lynia the cooking grandma 😢😢 now matpat😭😭😢🥺
I have only one request for Tom to keep the end of every video that we have for the legend. I thing everyone want to hear in their heart the words ,,Its just a theory a game theory" with his voice. If you know you know
He wont quit he will never abandoned his channel bcuz          "Its just a Game theory..."  Pls pin
Don't go man please come back....
we need to go an even more classic intro
The first minute got me dying of happiness 💀💀
damm this is really the end so what are we going to do know -walks into sunset-
🫡
I was a baby when matpat released game theory, I remember my sister telling me that she would watch your fnaf videos back in 2014
"-9 theories remain-" *classic intro* CRYING
I'll miss you dude, you may have ruined my childhood, but made some too.
4 days ago and 8 days ago he quit
Finally your back
Its completed
Is this for real is he not leaving the internet the Internet
YouTube will never be the same ever again
❤👹🛝
The classic intro has never hit so hard
Ferwell the best known theoriest
Just forget the pressure it’s to much but I just can’t handle it
Gotta say hearing the old intro again healed something inside of me ❤️‍🩹
Sadly I’m so sad that I’m probably not gonna watch this channel after matpat is gone 😢
*Proceeds to cry eyes out*
March 9th will be painful to my heart💔
I know you’ll leave but will you at least come by in some videos and could one of your videos be about lethal company
we need tom to go to the same place the OG matpat thinking image was taken and recreate it
Really is sad to see him go he is definitely not my most watched YouTuber as a kid unlike TDM stampy but he was the guy who really got me into fnaf lore so I got to thank him for that
DUDE MAKE 1 THEORY ADOFAI NEO COSMOS
I,m going to miss you matpat😟😭
Marat I will pay you my entire life savings 12k if you don’t quit

Do a theory on lethal company
Bro, thank you for that. Really bittersweet tho 0:45 one of the things I've missed from before the jump...l*****************
We'll all miss ya mat, ur my entire freakin childhood
The classic intro is back.

The last theory
This is the same feeling when the Blue Clues guy switched
Come back One day
I am gonna miss MATPAT’s Game theory! It’s just not gonna be the same! 😭
He. Wasn’t kidding. 😢
I think that you should check out a game known as "lethal company", I don't see many theories out there about it, and would love to hear about it from you before you go into the great YouTuber skybox.
I've missed the intro
Could you please do a GTA lore video on my birthday March 31st
Who else will miss the intro and matpat    👇

Just so you know mat pat, markiplier recently put an encoded message for you in his latest fnaf video. You should read it

I know this guy but why did matpat have to leave bro 😢
So I have a question mattpat(if u even see this) why was the goodbye internet video was the 666 video,did u mean too do it?
PLEASE Marat! Don’t go! You’ve always been there to theorize with me and I’ve had such fun from start to end, you are my idle and always have been! I’ve supported you and have always looked up to you so if you read this comment, I would like to tell you that I don’t want you to go. You ARE MY HERO!!! You’ve helped me theorize about the warden’s secrets and the missing children in FNaF, and the mysterious story of poppy’s playtime so all I have to say is please don’t go!   From: your supporter, Ecr 😢❤😢
This is gonna ruin my adulthood...

If matpat sees this which is pretty much unlikely, I just want to know how deadly is Godzilla’s atomic breath realistically, would be so powerful to destroy the Earth or will it be so weak that it wouldn’t even be enough to destroy a building?
the classic intro oh my gosh 😭
What’s going on
Make a Chrono Trigger theory for your final video. As a reference to the first video.
As a public transit user who also has freedom, I’m sad
Can you guys please leave png matpat in every video
I'm using this profile picture in honor of Matpat.
I know for a fact that once matpat is officially is gone, the views for this channel are going to drop tremendously, it’s a sad thought, but watch it’s gonna happen
tbh i dont even like garten of ban ban im just here for matpat
i’m running a whole marathon of rewatching ALL of Matpat’s videos….ALLL OF THEM
Me to bro

Pls dont stop at least make 1 or 2 vids a month or every other month pls dont stop
The last theory needs to be fnaf
THIS IS NOT EVEN FUNNY THE UTTP IS ATTACKING YOU

I have a question are you taking a break or are you not coming back?🥺
I literally broke down into tears when I saw the original intro😭
Mat I'm gonna watch the rest of the theories till the end
i don’t care if these last episodes suck (not that they ever do) or i hate the games he’s doing (like garter of banban), will i care? no. I’ll start to love the games as a memory of him and forever remember him til i die. thank you for everything. but that’s just a theory! a game theory! ❤🫡
To celebrate matpat and this era coming to a close im going to rewatch my favorite theories from him and i cant wait to see what comes next

RIP MATPAT😢😢😢😢😢
Eight more theories😔

I've actually barely watched you MatPat, but I've still been interested, and so seeing you go hurts me on a different level. It's like watching a loved one die, or find out your beloved pet go missing and never come home, but in my opinion, it's just a little theory.. A GAME THEORY- (i had to... i'm so sryyyy) Anyways, I'm gonna miss you so much along with everybody else!! Stay safe Mat 😭😭😭
please for the love of god
We got to give all the likes and views we can to this YouTube god
I wish I could have the old theme song as a ring tone😂😂

Can you please do a theory on home safety hotline?
We love you mat

I am so sorry mat pat I forgot you where here and even took you for granted but you are great
I thought he was gone
We all love you MatPat💚❤💛💙 Edit: I shall always be a theorist, I will always be here Mat
Just seeing the *9 Theories left* makes me cry I’m gonna miss him so much 😢
I hope he comes back to do fnaf theories at least
Bruh, I did not expect Neo-Liberal propaganda in such a game lol
While I am going to miss MatPat on all the Theorist channels so much, I know that he wouldn’t be handing his babies off he didn’t 100% trust the hands taking them. I know that these channels will continue to succeed, and maybe an occasional MattPatt Easter Egg will be in future videos! Gotta keep us up on the MP Looooorrrreeeee! ❤
Your theories were the best bro. Wish u the best Mat Patt😭🙏🏻
skook bot
Noooooooooooooooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭!!!!!!!!
That classic intro is absolutely FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Matpat chain please

March 9 will be the saddest thing this year
man dont leave us you made me cry bro...
The og game theorist
the intro made me smile cl
final theories finished: 1/9
Dont cry because it ended.. Smile because it happened☹️
Let’s get matpat to 20m before he’s gone
WHO IS TOM HE LOOKS LIKE MATPAT FROM WISH PATMEAT SORRY BUT ITS THE TRUTH
Last video should of been fnaf and i hope it is man maypat you were everyones childhood i watched your whole 2 hour fnaf lore you will be missed you raised almost every fnaf fan man
Too bad he’s quitting before GTA VI is out
love u matpat sad to see u go but loved when u made the best fnaf  theorys but yet again thats a theory A GAME THEORY
Hey guys, just rewatched the TryGuys vid from a year ago. Watching MatPat relentlessly roast mainstream media for being irresponsibly wrong gives me a sense of euphoria I don’t think I’ll ever feel again. Thanks MatPat, you’re a real one 🤩
Not much longer until the goat is gone
you could work as the voice tho
Since you are retiring from your host position why not make a video on work-life balance, now everyone has different circumstances so I am going to narrow it down to youtubers like you so they can enjoy life as much as they enjoy their work and not let one dominate the other would be kinda interesting to hear about it from someone who has been work first for over a decade
DONT LEAVE US MATPAT!! WE NEED YOU!!! YOUVE BEEN WITH US ALL THESE YEARS!!! DONT GO!!!

Why my birthday is March 9th 😢
I missed the og intro
YES ORIGINAL INTRO
One recent one is @cookingwithlynja
Matpat has been a big moment of my life, as I do my daily life I sometimes listen to matpat and his theories, but him leaving has realized that his theories have made me laugh, enjoy, and create inspirational quotes for younger YouTubers that I realized for a entire half of my life I have listen to him and I am now realizing that now that many YouTubers that were small became big all because of matpat through the energy of YouTuber and helpfulness, it is so sad he is leaving and I will add 1 inspirational quote day or week after to help the young YouTubers and the huge memories he made along the way
I'm going to miss ya running my childhood🤧

Why are you leaving
0:16 when fans get nostalgia
Yes loved the intro music, missed that.

Mat my favorite theory was the backrooms theory and I'm gonna miss you when your gone ❤
um hey matpat i know you have nine theories left but can you make a video about geometry dash lore?
? give up YouTube ???

Bro who are you
Its so sad to see him retire😢😢😢😢
I'm sorry matpat.. I'm so sorry..
Legendary return of the OG intro
I’m going to miss you
Even though I don’t watch matpat and I don’t really know him well I’m still gonna miss him.
I wonder if- when Tom is unable to voice a theory, will MatPat narrate for him instead?
I’d love an Andy’s Apple Farm update!!!
If a bot comments I’ll delete this comment
First Dantdm then stampy  and now mat?
The feeling of seeing the old intro brought so much joy
His reactions are priceless 😂
Wh- w- "sobs" when he left a part of us left.
NOOOOO PLEASE MAT DON'T LEAVE US PLEASSSSS
I cannot explain to you how hard I air guitared when the classic intro came on
The fnaf series is going to be much different once he goes
MatPat you should bring back the REAL throwback intro if you’re gonna bring nostalgia for these last couple of videos
Thank you Matpat.
at least there will be a new host
OH MY GOD! THE CLASSIC INTRO! I'VE MISSED THE INTROS!
MatPat is the goat and I will miss him so much
Matpat has to make cameos every now and again. He clearly loves this stuff.
Matpat is the best
Why can’t you do a video like every once in a while?
He didn’t quit?!??
bruh i was born when you started ruining childhoods
You sir were one of the first person to truly lay the foundation for my childhood and im gonna miss you 🫡👾🤯
Dear matpat, we will always remember your theory’s And when you got a lot of hate from a undertale thing your fans were there You will not be forgotten You will always be remembered Have a happy life Best wishes a random fan
THE INTROOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love it.
Ah yes the classic before he leaves….Will MISS UUU ❤❤ 😊
Imagine this: in the chapter before the last we uncover a crazy twist: that all of this was direct, from the "randomness" to the animations. And our character wakes up with extremly realistic graphics in a lab, where we have our final task for the coming chapter.... to actually find the child.
Pin going to try and be last to sub 😢
Watching this i feel like matpat makes everyone sound 1000% times smarter, thesee detailes go crazy, i didnt expect the bus and car thingy thats for sure
Game Theory (MatPat) I would like to now who wins on a fight Sonic or Silver.
1 down, 8 to go 😢
I am on the verge of tears and only 1 minute in 😢
man that is NOT the real classic intro
Lets get Matpat onto hot ones as a thank you❤😢😢
Can I join you for a Minecraft theory since, well you will be leaving us and I want to give some of my own theory’s, so what do you say … Look, ok I don’t know you will be leaving so I thought that if you are going to do a Minecraft theory in the days to come but I would like to join you for your last few theories what do you think, but hey that’s just a theory, a game theory… we will miss you Matt and please reply? Thank you and love you 🩷
Nooooooo i don't want you to go😢😢😢😢😢😢. Imma miss you bro 😢
I love you man, but this can not be one of the last theories, we gotta get a replacement my brother
I love the inclusion of science blaster and I hope they use it for the rest of Mat Pat's videos, it's a classic and it seems right to use it  We will all miss you Mat, but we are excited to see what you do next
My birthday is on March 9
As I watch tears stream down my eyes 😢
0:42 that song SLAPPSSSSSSS LETS GOOO
Matpat pls dont leave
Ain’t no way the first theory is a gartan of banban one
Srry if this is way off topic but- this could be  a LOOOOONG stretch but what about Cassie she could be patient 46 yk from security breach- (dont come after me-)
I didn’t realize how much I missed the classic intro
Another fallen soldier
Why are you quitting?
im going to miss matpat loads i hope he covers welcome home(the arg) on gt live he did a great job
I've been watching this matpat for like 12 or 13 years now im so sad to see him go but very happy it'll still continue with hosts we already know and love.
Classic Intro!    I also miss cutout matpat, the best version of matpat in my book.
Wait a min he back
9 more videos
Your final theory needs to be on fnaf 1 through 6 like the olden days
W matpat you will be missed 😢
Is it all channels?
your really wasting ur last theories on garten of banban
I’m here to support matpat but man this game seems dumb.
Did MatPat not finish the whole playthrough of VI on GTNotLive? I saw that episode, and it did not look finished. I'm confused.
I swear his last theory is gonna be some garden of ban ban or poppy’s playtime. I wish he would put more effort into making these past videos family friendly, instead of just a children’s channel
we will always love you matpat you got us through hard times and it is hard for you and us to let go you and the channel we will remember you always
9 theories left brothers. stay strong.
Remember it's just a theory  ... a game theory😢
Rick and Morty anyone?
I was following this channel, for 7 years and I am missing matpat so much, he was the main guy that was posting about game theorists.
You said your retired
I’ve only started watching this channel in a year bro😭😭😭
This is made three days ago. I love your videos. I remember seeing your one did you said goodbye Internet six hours after it was posted I didn’t want to post on it. I just wish you would stay.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is this your last video I though you just lided for a second
I WILL MISS YOU
Matpat's 10 last theories, marks the oncoming of a new theorist.
I just want to tell everyone on this show and who contributes to creating these videos have helped bring a sort of semi-monthly structure to my skizeoffective disorder; and that in some of my darkest times I’ve had these videos to help bring me informative format entertainment.
Goodbye matpat …😢
intro hits like a nostalgia dump truck thanks mat pat
THANK GOD I LISTENED CAREFULLY AND STILL 8 THEORIES MAIN
I have a theory what if we still have matpat on film food and fasion theroy but just not game theory
Garten of banban one was the peak of this game 😭😭😂😂
7:48 nabnab don't fall into the mind control, it's nabnableena.
4:25  we will miss matpaat
Mattpat since you’re retiring soon I only have one request before you go, can you make a sonic timeline? Just asking, have a nice day.
Can’t explain how much I’m gonna miss mat pat
Dont leave us!😭
5 weeks untill poppy playtime chapter 3….
Goodbye you will stay in my memory, when I get kids I will tell them about this and your other channels, and will talk about the joy and nostalgia you bring me
I hope you can come back one day
I think the last for five nights at Freddy's
Plz can I have the channel I’m new on YouTube or can u atlest give me a shout out plz
I wish him leaving was just a theaory
is 2024
Game theory, can you guys do a theory on a Roblox game called 'A stereotypical obby?' Well, it's connected to a bunch of different games you could go into just from that game and clues in literally everything (tips, obby parts, text boxes, SO MUCH SCREAMS LORE SO PLS DON'T IGNORE ALL OF IT!!!   What set me off and sent me to want to mention it is that there was basey4 that translates to some CRAZY STUFF that had me want to go digging. I want a theory about it to make sure my theory is believable and maybe share a theory with you guys but I don't want to tell my theory for fear of you seeing it and ignoring it and not doing one and just like 'Well Alexaq268 already has a theory' WHICH I DO!!   I also tried to tell the theory in a comment but I think it glitched or smthn cause I typed out my theory twice and they didn't go through or I just can't see 'em. I think it's TOTALLY THEORY WORTH and it's not like you haven't done Roblox theories before. 'A stereotypical obby' PLS REMEMBER IF IT SOUNDS INTERESTING!!!! P.S I will miss you sm Matpat
bye matpat ):
Matpat did make a comment about us just commenting our goodbyes and not the actual theory so I guess we are just proving him right. That much is no longer a theory.
😢
The nostalgia of the og intro
raldis crackhouse theory???
Although we will miss matpat maybe Tom will bring something new to the channels and it’ll continue to be better
You know what we all want.. a Fortnite lore theroy yes fortnite does have lore
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO!!
Do a legends of Zelda Majora's mask  and mix it up on how the mask ended in legends of Zelda breath of the wild
May pay please say that you leaving is just a theory
Im so glad about the classic intro!!!! thank you matpat
Bruh no way if u leave I un sub
Thank you king
I will miss you matpat :(
Matpat before you go there were five missing children at chuckie cheese so maybe do a video about it
We need a guest appearance from nugget before u leave matpat
I just met you and I can believe YOUTUBE never recommend me your channel 😢😢😢. I found you the most gorgeous and charismatic man ❤
We shall savor these last theories greatly…
Bro pls stay 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Only matpat vid i watched while being sad😢
Long live matpat
5:55 I see that Skyrim Reference!
You are my childhood ❤
I know the big worm Zolfeos, or whatever, is basically just a simple 3D model with 3 face holes cut out and I’ve know a tool can do that easily but it’s still the 1 actually freaky thing in these games.
one question matpat aka the game theory guy. are you still able to upload the funny games on your GTLIVE
Matpat please give me big wet kiss before you leave 😔
he wont be around for poppy playtime 3. i’ve never been more upset.
Kreekraft will miss you
I just hope that the new guy would say something in the new vids like matpat.
what about THE ORIGINAL
We will miss you so much…
"ruining your childhood since 2011" crazy 😭😭🙏
I was a huge fan of game theory I started win i was just 7 I’ll never forget you 😢
Bro I am gunna miss you you were my childhood
Yay he his here but I miss you man you are the best thank you so much
lets go the classic imtro
Don't Cry cuz it's over, smile cuz it happend.
We need a lethal company theory before Matpat leaves! This game is hella fun.
Goodbye matpat 😖 ima miss u 😭😰 *sniffles*
i think it would make sense if the busses in the dream sequences where suppose to be resembeling the scientist. As a bus like a scientist took our little monster away and when the other tried to rescue him the scientist shot that down or even got rid of him. the bus hitting you was a scientist firing or getting rid of you.
OMG THE OLD INTRO
WELL MISS YOU SO MUCH 😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😢🥺😩😫
Same the harts are all of the theory’s ❤️💚💛🩵
Same zero...same😢
I have an idea for a game theory idea what is Chica cupcake?

I’m gonna miss you Mat ❤
I hope matpat has a crazy video for his last
Matpat

Bruh I commented suggesting a theory and i can't find the comment 😭😭
This channel will lose lots of views
Wealth, fame, power...  Matpat , the King of the theorists, obtained this and everything else the world had to offer and his retiring words drove countless souls to YouTube.""You want my channel?  You can have it!  I left the password I created in one place!  Now you just have to find it!
Dont quit pls pls matpat pls dont quit
They're not dreams, but manipulations from Stinger Flynn.

I genuinely jumped out of my chair in excitement over seeing the classic intro again
The wise man we all miss❤
I like the old intro of your feet your fairies I like it like it what does a troll of your mouth at YouTube YouTube fairies 0:57
THE THING I LOVED THE MOST ABOUT THE OLDER VIDEOS IS THE INTRO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Not that Joshua a bull dog what a pink ball no guy is a truck with hands and face and eyes with teeth around and we're both purple ball Adventures Himalayan and purple
Matpat was and is my childhood he's amazing and were all gon a miss you so much cause it's been a wild journey with you matpat so thank you.. For everything
Man tom is cool and all but can't you just stick around 😢
You should do a geometry dash lore theory because it just realeased 2.2 update after like 7 years
Its sad to see MattPatt leave, but cool to see in my recommended a clip of CBS talking about him retiring
What if the Cho Cho Charles scene was supposed represent a different doctor but who was a lot more scary and harmful. Thus they picture him still as a train but as a terrifying one
You need to make a theory about "Bugshot Roulette". There are many rumors, that its a metaphor for gambling or dr*g addiction. Also its implied, that the Dealer played(and killed) God
1 gone 9 more to go...
I will not allow MatPat to leave before he does a Lethal Company theory! We will all miss you
Got mega goosebumps when I saw that intro
WHO LoVES game theory like this comment
The only ones that are not controled mat pat are nabnab jumbo josh stinger flin zolphes and seringion and his children also think in chapter 5 or 7 zolphes is going to play a crucial role in chapter 5 or 7
I kinda spaced out during his goodbye video, if he mentioned it, whats gonna happen to GTlive?
i don't even know what banban is but watching this for matpat
hey, let's not be pessimistic here, 9 theories more until he leaves! that's like 150 or even more minutes more that matpat is here with us..which is not a lot but still! im gonna be sad when he leaves but let's appreciate these last theories together! game theories.
Matt uploads almost every day in between his 4 channel
I dont know why you ever got rid of that intro haha  it makes the videos better
I will mISS you 😭😭
Mat pat, I want you to check out a game called shipwrecked 64 if you haven't already. It will get your brain hurting and getting scared.
Gametherory is not going to be the same without you. Im worried that other childhood youtubets that I have watched will retire soon.
Goodbye👋🏻 😢 9 theories remain😓😓
I will kms the day matpat stops.
Can we do one last Pokémon theory
I'll miss you Matpat, I hope Tom can do like you could but with a new generation.
😢 Don't quit❤
I SWEAR, LIKE THIS COMMENT FOR SALUTING MAT BEFORE I CRY!
Like if your watching this after the retiring video.
I got goosebumps from the opening. Teared up a little
Mat not 9th plz my birthday on the 9 th
rip matpat you will be missed
The og intro made me feel so much better
Goodbye matpat will be miss you
1:52 but matpat the leeches as the naughty ones that you call tem as doesn't have eyes?
We will miss you and I'm literally crying
it's funny that the text ruining your childhood since 2000 what was that again is funny😂
It will not be the same it will never be the same
Odds quiting is part of some arg is hopeful thinking, and hopefullness and naivety have a near invisible line.
i have a short theory if you turn nabnab s name its banban so maybe they are related?
matpat do a one piece style arg where the person who solves the arg gets to have the passwords of the theory accounts

Goodbye matpat i will never be the same anymore
Thank you for everything you've done for us. MatPat, you have no idea how many childhoods you've built just from your channel. Your videos got me into making things, creating lore for my own worlds. I think I can speak for everyone when I say this: we'll miss you, MatPat.
We will miss you.. my fav youtuber we will.
I never really liked the videos but don't LEAVE PLEASE I NEED YOU

Missed that intro so much. I’ll miss matpat even more!
In the end, the only theory is life.
Thank you Mat, for giving us great lore on games
After Matpat is gone, i'm unsubscribing forever. I don't care who takes the stand, it will never be the same again.
I would want to say that the development of Garden of BanBan is one of the fastest developments in our game history
Seeing the internet collectively support MatPat restores my faith in humanity.
🫡

Mat Pat please post  once a year don't care when or why no games just talk we need you
The original intro best intro in my opinion
I need to take a lap after hearing the og intro
plzzzzzzzzzz go for  40
if he ends it off with fnaf, it'll finally have come full circle
For those sad ones this help me so it may help you -down below-
I miss you matpat we will remember you
Can you do a Stampys lovely world theory for your last video
The intro:YEEEEEEEEE
Honestly, I’m over it already.
Yay he’s not quitting
I miss matpat already. Rip this is like when technoblade died
Do a vid on Noita there’s this secret that no one’s figured out yet
It’s like a doomsday clock, we’re just counting down until THE DAY. We’re all gonna miss ya, Matpat.

Holy cow i just realized this channel is as old as me its like a sibling to me and theres grampat
I am done watching when he leaves I'll still be subbed but I don't want to change the memory's I have of matpat and theories
The Old Intro really got me 😢
The fact that the top comment on every recent video from all four channels is something about missing lately really shows how incredible he has been to all of us
honestly he should make a theory on Candy Cadet
why not fnaf ? with matpat
Matpat, please, man, dont quit. You are my childhood, you've helped me through my hard times, please dont quit
whos gonna tell me the fnaf lore now
❤❤❤
Yay the old intro
day 1 of asking matpat to make a my singing monster theory

You should make one more Minecraft theory before you go
I would like to ask, after matpat leaves (it feels really sad saying that, I’m gonna miss you matpat, we all wish you well) will they still make episodes about very small games and shows?
As much as i love the videos its mostly matpat i watch them for. I doubt i will continue to follow once he isnt in the videos sorry guys

Hope you enjoy your retirement matpat!
first i just want to say game theory cant be the same without matpat secondly can matpat just be like stan lee and show up like cameos
I missed the old intro
Wait, "9 theories remain" does that mean there are 9 more theories MatPat will do before stop posting or is he still continuing, I'm so confused
Thank you matpat, for all the theory’s and memory’s
Short wars v2 next pls
You wanna know what would be cool for a random theory each year like completely random they bring Matt on for like just one video that would be pretty cool
that intro hit me in tears
matpat please I’ll give you my brand new Jordan ones if you stay
hey! eight more to go right?.. I'm going to miss you matpad..
We’re all thinking the same thing.
Hopefully the last few theories will be trips to memory lane, we'll never forget you Matpat ❤

“Ruining your childhood since 2021” 💀💀💀

Man I can’t take it! Matpat leaving is very depressing, but kinda exciting because the channel will be different. But still, I am not ready for Matpat to leave.
Please make a theory about Lethal company

Mat pat please don’t go away from us :(
Goodbye MatPat 😢
PLS DO THE OG INTRO FOR FOOD THEORY AND FILM THEORY AS WELL!!! I MISS THEM TOO 😭  Also random thought/request: I REALLY hope they keep Mat's voice for the end of the intro's saying 'Welcome to FOOD/GAME/FILM/STYLE THEORY' for all future episodes 🥺. Or at least some part of his to remember the OG legend 😔❤
Wait no- I haven’t been watching in a while and I’m just realizing why haven’t I seen the intro in a while- that thing was amazing. I need to see why it stopped being used I must have missed an announcement
And I’ll be in denial for at least a little while what about the plans we made
goodbye matpat… we will miss you..❤ 2009-2024
Im glad you were there and i hope you and your family have great lives
You are my childhood I can’t believe you’re going
I'm gonna miss matt pat man.😭
Thank you for being there for us matpat
its sad to see you go, i grew up watching you. I hope you can live a long and happy life. ❤

The thumbnail should have said "A-banban-don all hope!"  Lol, get it?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the classic intro just hits so much harder when he's giving up the channel
This makes me even more sad I never made a game that could be made into a theory video by MatPat
mat bro please you are one of my top fav YouTubers pls keep going im just bro just pls keep going❤🙏
The classic into almost made me cry
Spell banban backwards
why uttp is invading the comments
I wonder if the parent that your controlling. Is a monster mascot that was given more than three genomes and the human stayed while the others were mostly disposed, and the Human remained and remnants though you reincarnate like everyone else seems to do. GV seems to heal death the human is a mascot but keeps its size. the human Donor might have died and you are a human mascot with the human Donors Memories and look's the human genome was so much with GV  they might have used the spider monkey as well as that had the most promise they might have tried to use a bit jelly fish but 4 genome and the human was more  but instead of disposing all of the Genomes a small GV  bonded to the human genome giving the power of instant reincarnations like they all seem to have. But that's just a Theory A GAME THEORY.
Yesss the original intro is the best I missed it so much
Oh you do not know how much i missed that intro
Bye….. matpat
No way we just got hit with the classic intro

Wait what will happen with you are make new videos please don't
We’ll miss you so much, Mattpat. You’ve been a very amazing and important person in all of our lives and I hope you come back to us in a few future videos or on GT live. Have fun with your last nine theories.
my first ever theory that i’ve ever watched on this channel was is the evil mario one, and i remember showing my sister that video so she can believe what i heard about. I remember the fear i felt after watching every single one of ur theories, but couldn’t stop coming back for more. I love the way the videos make me open my eyes, and just knowing the lore makes me feel go great. matpat even though these videos always scare me to my core they always leave a place in my heart. i grew up watching u and it breaks my heart knowing that u wont be hosting anymore, but i am excited for this new era and can’t wait to see what’s to come.
I’ll miss you, Matt Pat thank you for all the joy you brought me and all your other fans, but I am kind of disappointed that your last theory is on garden of band in the game. That sucks.
Thank you, Matpat.
No don’t go
I will miss mat pat i have been watching game theorists for like 7 years and matpat was there
I cannot tell you how hard I smiled at seeing the old Game Theory intro
I honestly love that Banban is the first of the remaining 9 theories lol
I’m going to miss you so much matpat

“Ruining your childhood since 2011” is the complete opposite of what he actually did

I swear to god if one of the last matpat videos isn’t “proving that sans is ness” I am gonna scream.
random idea for matpat or next owner idk why: make book theory channel, there’s a lot of books that crave theories-
Why he post if he said he quit
I found a way to charge to my tablet
Don’t go mat 😢😢😢
make the last theory be the entire video game, film, food, and stiye timeline
Someone see if he has discord and invite in to discord group chat just for him and his fans if he doesn't have one
9 more theorys with matpat, thank you for my childhood and being my favorite I hope that you were gonna be able to inspire more youtubers with the past you have inspired a lot of youtubers I watched
We will miss our king of theory

cant believe matpat is leaving, the internet will never recover from this, please dont leave us for too long matpat, come back some day.
When I tell you, I jammed out so hard to the original intro. That thing is my childhood encased in a hug.
You should make a theory about lobotomy corporation   It has a lot of interesting lore and the team project moon behind it keep expanding it by sequels and web comics
Please tell me that ur gonna make appearances on the channel

I don't want mat pat to leave don't leave please stay😢
the og intro omg 😭😭😭

Now bring it the back the old original intro for food theory.
Gametheories will never be the same after 9th of march
Did I miss a secret lets play of Banban? Please tell me I didn’t
Always remember it’s a theory a game….
I hope there is a lethal company theory
Imagine Ollie growing up and inheriting the channel

I'ma miss you matpat I'm glad you're still gonna do a few more videos before you leave
How sad Matpat will not the host in the future but i HOPE the new host will do better or keep the style of Matpat you are legend
he posted i thought he quitted
I understand why you’re leaving and it’s long overdue but that doesn’t mean I’m not upset about it I’m gonna miss so much matpat 😔
It Will never be the same😢😢😢
Hey matpat is sad to see you go😓 but I have this game called tattle tale is like a horror game and I think there is lore I'm not sure but it would be amazing if you do it is okay if you can't I understand 👍
Get bro to 20 million subscribers before he leaves

WE ALL WILL MISS YOU MATPAT
Adios amigo
anyone still waiting for a yokai watch theory?
Are you doing one on Lethal Company?
the HYPE i had at the classic intro!! I missed it so muchhh
Matpat thank you for entertaining me since i was a kid
8 left...
I will always miss you mattpatt, you were apart of my childhood.... I hope you spend the rest of your life happier than ever.
ngl, when I see the theories count down, it scares me. I was expecting to see mattpatt introduce himself and the intro animation play, but what I was met wit is a dark screen with bold white text and ominous drums as audio....
Bro whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy not fnaf
classic intro ftmfw
Goodbye matpat
Well here we are🥲
9 theories until we get Tom, 9 theories with the classic intro, and 9 theories with matt, 9th of march will be a sad, and respecteed day, can't wait to watch the other 9!
I’m going to miss him so much, thanks matpat
Even though I don’t watch matpat it’s kind of sad seeing a YouTuber quit
667. Im going to miss the previos video count. :(
😢😢😢😢 r.i.p mattpat
Yesssss classic intro song!
OK I get that Matt Pat has to keep up with the times if he wants to stay relevant but seriously nine theories left until he leaves and he’s talking about something for two-year-olds?! listen I love Matt but seriously I’m disappointed. Sincerely, the guy who made this comment.
Not the same😢
We can't be zulphius in the dream because in the dream .where captain gets taken we see zulphius in the background.
Please at least do some guest appearances if a new fnaf game comes
If you leave, game theory will not be game theory 😢😢😢
I’m going to miss you you’ve kept me going since my mom passed 🥺🥺🥺 I’ll miss you matpat ❤️❤️❤️
The last video😢
Dude, I'm gonna miss you.
Hey before you go can you make a theory about a game on vr called Gorilla tag
E.
When he played the old intro I turned the volume all the way up and just sat there letting the nostalgia do its thing
Can't believe you are leaving right before the new Bendy game comes out,
Do one on Fortnite
Don’t quit
Wait hes  back or not?
thank you
i have been wanting to see that intro for so long
You know the voice of the jester is @KreekCraft?
Bro needs to do one final fnaf theory as the final video
I really can't enjoy this anymore

"I suspect the next few chapters are going to give us a few more" Us? Us???? So youre staying right?...right?...
We will all miss you mat and we hope that the last theory is FNAF lore.
hopefully you 'retiring' is a joke like the fnaf movie act
Im gonna tell this to DannoCalDraws
The intr made me cry
The last theory
I started watching at 3 and now I am turning 13😢
Don't leave the chanel 1 of my favorites 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

literally just watched this video about garten of banban cause its matpat's final theories and im gonna miss him
im gonna miss matpat so much dude
Why 😢
Ive always wanted to see that intro with all 4 colors
NOO he can not leave without having a Coca cola commercial!.
I was so excited when they said they were bringing gong back the classic intro and let down after like 5 seconds
Classic intro made me shed a few tears
Im going to cry and die inside because Matpat is leaving. I hope both sides of your pillows are warm, Matthew..
Me to
I cried when seeing the intro :(( dont goooo
Even thi the og intro says ruining our childhood since 2011 i think it should say: Making your childhood great since 2011.
all I ever wanted was for you to make theory's on my moives I wanna make when I'm 27 and now that your retiring it will never happen but I hope you will be able to still see it goodbye matpat I will miss you so much
Let's go! I was wondering if he was going to bring the old intro back! W for MatPat fans
13 years of theory’s. Happy for matpat, but sad he’s going
UTTP is the worst thing ever
Do a hello neighbour theory it's basically giving to devs their wish
w
THE OLD INTRO GOT ME SO EMOTIONAL 😭😭💞💕💘

Salute legend🥲🫡
Mat was and is the first YouTuber I’ve watched and seeing that he only has a few theories left makes me want to cry 😢😢😢
We will miss you mat  pat
We will miss u matpat D:  We will remember the memories we had all these years .. 😞😞😔😔
sadly, i doubt game theory will retain even a fraction of the viewers without matpat being around
I'm gonna say.. my goodbye to you now. Goodbye our theory lord MatPat
The first 2 minutes gave me the chills.
thank you for all the work youu've done matpat. have a nice life.
Matpat I'm gunna miss u can u please do a fnaf theory in the last nine, thanks for being part of my childhood.
Why is he leaving
Goodbye Mattpatt. Even if i didn't watch you, you will always be a legend.
:( I WILL WATCH EVERY ONE OF UR VIDS
gonna miss ya matpat- you were a huge part of my life..  ALSO: one thing I noticed you skipped in figuring out who WE as the player was was at 16:27, the EXACT sentence that goes after the one matpat highlight it’s says “ZOLPIUS can only stay ALSEEP if nobody goes to investigate” and what did matpat just show us in timestamps 15:08,15:11,15:15, and 15:35 all have one thing in common. The word referring to US being SLEEPY.  Don’t know if somebody already said it- but I just felt a bit uneasy seeing how easily he missed/skipped that! LOVE YA MATPAT❤
Man I’m going to miss you man I watched one of your ever first videos man I wish you never had to see you go
We are all going to miss you matpat
Please don’t retire on March 9 that’s two days after my birthday
I'll miss you matpat if we see your replacement in the fnaf movie 2 ill still be sad
Im gonna miss matpat, but are we gonna also talk about the theory?- lol
We miss u!
I am so sad
Imagine mats final theory being a theory on game theory
Heres someone you guys should always remember. "Don't cry because it's over. Be happy because it happened" ❤❤ we love you matpat ❤❤
Watching his videos will never be the same now. I feel less motivated tbh.. but I NEED to watch it….
YEAH CLASSIC INTRO
It's sad to see you go Matpat. I hope you and your family have a lot of fun in the year's to come
Hello matpat can you make you final theory a fnaf theory I will Miss you btw
I came here only for the intro
Love you matpat hope you live the fullest of your life after retiring
You'll never be forgotten mattpat
I actually did a cover of the intro music in college to put behind a radio ad I made for game theory as a project. It’s so nice to hear it come back 😭
Man I really missed that 2017 intro brings back memories.
Nabnab wasn't infected  because he wasn't on the ceiling or the ground  in fact I think he was able to escape and there wasn't stinger flin.
I think in the dream world we are the human because as soon as they said I wish jumbo and Josh was here Stinger Flynn looked at us suggesting that it was our fault. I will miss you :c
We will all miss you matpat
THANK YOU FOR THE INTRO
When I clicked on this video, I did not expect to see you leaving😢
Best Theary
this thumbnail should’ve said “abanban all hope”
I’m gonna say a bad word in the chat
Bros counting it down💔😭
A legendary ending for a legendary   legend 😢
o7 we love you matpat
Science blaster really hits
I hope matpat will still maybe every once in awhile be in a video
Why did you make video that you said (goodbye internet)🙄😒😒😒
Will the old vidos remain on the channel?
love the return of the intro
It’s unsettling how similar my frequent nightmares are to this
Bro your my child hood your plants vs zombie vids from 5 years ago were the best we all love you bro thank you for my childhood ❤
we are going to miss you, your way to theorize.
i’m gonna miss matpat more than i miss my dead cat
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo😢😢😢😢 matpad
Hey Matpat, i’ve been watching for awhile, and i’d really like if you’d honor my request. Even if it’s your last, I’d really like to see a buckshot roulette theory.
We will always remember matpats words when he retires     Its not just a theory         ITS A GAME THEORY! Spam in replies if you miss him (you don't have to)
I came just for the intro
Yea
I’m gonna really miss MatPat saying this line, “It’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY!”😢
Bro casually drops a video after the goodbye video, we will miss him soon
Ay Matty boy are u gonna do a theory on my series the sewer series?do not watch it it’s horrible
I don't even know what this game is.
MATPAT !! its been 4 years when are you gonna make the last PETSCOP THEORY
Bro is cool.
You shall not leave.*cuts mat pat’s legs off*
It's just a theory a game theory!!!!!!
Man Im going to miss him
Don’t be sad that’s he is leaving he made all of our childhood and lots of YouTubers childhood too
PLEASE DONT RETIRE THIS HAS TO GE A JOKE RIGHT😅 UHM PLEAEE NO😢❤
I think the post children are turned into naughty ones
As someone who has never watched any game plays of Garten of Baban or even heard of the game; what is happening.
I’m soo emotional my nose is bleeding
I love the old intro so much but the majora's mask inspired title at the beginning of each video gives me the chills. I'm sad just like everyone else because MatPat is leaving but I'm excited for what's to come. I'm really excited about having Tom be the host! By the way would it be possible to have an intro for Tom too?
Yes the og intro
i know this might sound petty but as a final attempt to actually meet u (and hopefully u read this)i have one theory for u about undertale/deltarune i hope im not too late with this
I missed the classic intro so much
Analog horror alert analog quarter alert 🚨🚨🚨.  It's called Angel here, it's basically a set of tapes on a series here on YouTube, which is basically about a set of v CHS tapes that a girl named Jonah found that seemed to talk to her or something like that
We all will miss you and, this channel is older than me but we ALL love you
now i have to worry while watching the videos :(
Mat Pat you retiring on my B DAY??????

Gonna miss MattPatt sooo much!! Been watching you for 10 years. That's literally half of my life!! Thank you for all your videos and your the work you put into your videos! I wish you and your family the best of best!! Thank you again! ❤
he needs to make at least one more fnaf theory
Hey soon, the guy he’s handing the channel off to. It’s gonna be more iconic than him because the next generation is going to know more about him than they will matpat
We will miss you matpat you made our childhood thanks for everything
gosh, matpat, i’m gonna miss this. Hope the last theory is a fnaf one!
I remember the old intro when i first started to watch
Matpat before you fully go play buckshot roulette and give a theory about it..
Guys let's get him to 20 mil before its to late
not fair i don’t wanna miss seeing your face 😢
We love you Matpat and we will miss you thank you for the memories❤
I  never thought  that the old intro will be back
Bro don't leave or I'm gona unalive myself
Sadness countdown
Oh man the intro
Bro no matter what person you give this channel to it wil never be the same
We all will miss you
I am going to miss matpat so much man it’s not going to be the same with out him
that sound track at the end is fire. Matt, I will miss you.
We're  all gonna miss you so much! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cant believe Scott Cawthon hasn't been on a single GT video after about 10 years of fnaf theories 🤦
I honestly wish matpat wouldn’t give the channel to someone else😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thanks for the memories I started watching when I was 6 now I'm 11 thank you matpat you will always be in my heart
Nostalgia
Although we all are going to miss Matpat, I do hope Tom will be appreciated by the community rather than being constantly compared to Mat. There's no doubt that things will feel different, but I can only hope that future generations can find this channel and appreciate it the same way we all did the past decade.
The classic intro music just hits diffrent in this video we love you Matpat
I have a theory about the minecraft alley and I was wondering if you could help me solve my theory
We will miss you matpat 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like for him to see this 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I think matpats last theory should theorise his channel
Can you post a video that’s just your old intro? Pleaseeeeee
Bye dude 😭💔😥
Lethal company Lore would be great
I missed that intro sooo badd
Same and different
Wait, the intro is complete…
Me to
The countdown only begins, and unlike new years, no one is looking forward to the ball dropping
It will never be the same knowing he will leave 😭
We will miss you mat pat
Seeing the classic intro now with all 4 sections being finally complete really makes everything come full circle
You make my childhood think you 😢 we will miss you
Yes, majora's mask countdown.  I expected nothing less from team theorist
Oh God how much did I miss the OG GT opening 😭
I always loved your classic intro😊❤
I bet one of the last vids will be a fnaf one
I am crying before this vid even started.
I know Yandere Simulator have a bad Dev but have you ever considered checking it out? Maybe this could go in your 9 theory maybe :) but we'll miss you :)
We’re going to miss you man😭
Imagine if he comes back for gta 6😢
I'm so sad that one of the last theory's is wasted in this game
I'm going to miss you so much MatPat, but I can't say how hard I missed the old intro and actually said YES!!!, and I was headbanging so hard, but for real, I will miss you
Ahh i missed that intro.
I love the Old intro

My chest hurts every new upload 😢 we goin miss yu matpat

Even though I don’t know anything about garden of banban, I’m still watching this to cherish MatPat’s final moments
Memory have been 100% restored

He's gonna end up like technoblade😔
Really sad nine more to go🎉
Please make a non-fnaf theory before you go
Same
Why?...
I'll be unsubbing when mat goes, few shows can survive the host leaving.
I'll miss MatPat, but I'm sure Tom will do the channel justice.
Classic intro gives me so much happiness
Omg 😸
I’m gonna miss mat so much man right when I heard that intro it brought back so much nostalgia
Please do a Pokémon theory it’s been so long
Does anyone know how can we get fanart to MatPat and the team on Instagram? Thanks. We are going to miss MatPat so much💚❤️💛💙
This is a sign lol… So as of last week I began composing and writing out science blaster for a group of me and my friends to preform at a music festival lol. So the fact that he brought back the old intro tells me I’m doing the right song XD

MBCC VS ANTITROLLS
Thank you MatPat! The intro is back!!!
1ST WARNING ~ THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING JOIN MBCC!

Thats just a theory
WHERE'S JACOB?
WHO ASKED + MBCC IS WAY BETTER THAN UTTP AND MATPAT!!!
started watching this channel at 7 years old. I have now recently turned 18 and am about to graduate from high school. what.
We got 2 more months until ya know
Tets deap just lik the old deijs.Thench you
8 left
Thank you mat pat.... you will be really missed
I’ve missed the intro a lot, so happy it’s back!
MAN man.. im gonna miss everything from game theory
9 theories left 😢 we'll miss you❤
We are losing a legend
9 Theory's left..
Funny thing is that the most important thing is that we are told that it isn't real. If it is a dream why even say that at all. I think it's because the whole thing isn't real. What the character is experiencing  isn't real at all. This is why 5 doesn't exist because none of it is real at all.
One of the last theorys with matpat.😭😭😭
MATPAT!?
Goodbye matpat.   We will miss you. 😢
It's been 5 years since I started watching your video's. Thank you for everything. You are my reason why I love fnaf 🫡
We will miss you
Man 😢
For you're last episodes you should make one complete timeline of every theory
Stay
Gonna miss u matpat

This hurts. I cried during the "Goodbye Internet" video, I cried during this one, and I'm going to cry during the next 8 or 9. I'm only 14, but he is literally my entire childhood, and seeing him go hurts!! This is the worst way to start 2024, and the worst reminder that we're getting older...
Eins.

The Vietnam Flashbacks when the intro played.
Got to say it feels horrible and great to say goodbye to matpat I grew up watching him I remember getting home from school in 4th grade to watch the newest theory and now I get to say goodbye as I graduate high-school and look towards the future of transitioning and life knowing he is moving on as well   It's a very interesting feeling
Petcorp!!! Please finish it
come on guys, lets try and get matpat to 20mil before he quits
We’ll all miss you Matpat. Thank you for bringing us joy and bringing back the old  intro

You know for all you wrestling fans is it a coincidence that sting and matpat are related because they both are retiring in March
In dream 1 Mr jellyfish says Ofc this isn’t real but it could be
are you planning on making a new theory on the Binding of Isaac? We’re on Repentance now, and a lot has changed after 8 years.
i hope matpat pulls a smosh in the next 10-15 years
Bruh im gonna miss matpatttt
Man I going to miss matpat
Sadly, I think the game theories on this channel are going to become a much lower quality. As in, certain pieces of evidence and theories don't actually make sense and I'm not talking about speculation parts of the theory.  Idk how they got to the conclusion that you are Zolphius in the dreams. If you can see Zolphius in the dreams then that means you wouldn't be Zolphius, which was the same way as proving that you aren't Banbalina either and that's because you interact with her in one of the dreams. They had just said that Zolphius is there in those dreams when they appear and they explain why they are far away from the group. Yet, YOU are Zolphius? Idk, it doesn't add up. I'm assuming MatPat isn't really part of writing these scripts and theories anymore because I don't think he would let that slide.
give his last 9 theories 3m views up
😭😭😭We will miss you mat pat 😭😭😭im 17 and I have been watching you since the begging we all will miss you the theorist will never be the same
9 theories then he will be gone. We will miss you Matpat. :(
For one of your last theories could we do a papas games theory
I can't believe that it's actually happening.... I was literally thinking of how much theories I was gonna watch after I finish my exams, and boom, "Goodbye Internet" hit me so hard in the face
I'm gonna miss ya
THE CLASSIC INTRO 0:31  YESSSSSSSSSSSS!! Keep the intros running!
It’s crazy that I was born the same day and year as when warpath started YouTube
I think there is only 2 videos on this channel that's actually made me cry
I’m kind of sad because may pat cannot do a theory on the Minecraft movie coming out in 2025
We ain’t watching Game Theory without MatPat.
I missed the old intro of matpat, I will miss matpat so so much he was one great man
We will miss matpat
The final intro should be the first ever intro of every channel combined into one
The old intro brings back way to much nostalgia
I’m going to miss mat pat😢
Ill miss you Mat, you were such a big influence to my personality. I'm a HUGE fnaf fan, and whenever I have a theory I just say: but that's just a theory, A GAME THEORY. We'll miss you Mat.
Come on guys, get him to 20 Million before he leaves.

So it begins
We love you matpat❤
The original intro gave me so much nostalgia. I'm so glad he did that
The nostalgia of the intro is just... Wow
I’ve been watching matpat since 2nd grade with his fnaf theory’s and I am super sad to let you go matpat   Famous words “but that’s just a theory a game theory”
Please don't leave don't quit I'm sad
It's been sad seeing you leave, but i understand it's for the best.. you have a family and can not put work before them. I will not cry when you leave, i will be happy for you! Leave us with a smile, leave us on a happy note! Leave us with a  "Its just a theory, a game theory!.".
the intro is so incredibly nostalgic
The old intro hit me hard 😢
I'm re-watching every matpat theory right now. Currently in the first stages of the fnaf Playlist. You will be remembered always.
Bro please don’t quit
in every dream, you could be a different character
I will miss you  :(
That OG intro HITS!!
Guys please stop commenting hateful things about matpat leaving a lot of us will miss him. Please be respectful!! (They are most likely bots though)
rip matpat we will miss you you built our childhoods or laid the foundation thank you..
I loved that intro
I will never stop missing matpat, such an inspiration for me.
Matpat, im 10, so i cant say i spent my entire life with you, but i will miss you as i have watched you since i was 7.
Hey, Matt, how about for your final theory, it’s about the first game you made a theory on, Chrono Trigger?
seeing that og intro made me shed a tear
MORE CLASSIC! MUST GO FURTHER BACK!
Nice theory!
We're gonna miss you matpat,AND I DON'T WANT YOU "MY CONTENTS BETTER" LITTLE KIDS WITH 9 SUBS IN MY COMMENT SECTION!
2025 will be sad without  Mattpat over analyzing games
Oh my god the introooo broooo it took me back so far so nostalgic :'(
Man I have grown  up with this I’m gonna miss you
Bro please don't quit it was fun watching all your videos and funny a bit ☹☹☹🤔
literally screamed when the intro came in 😢
😐🤏 goodbye soldier
Hi matpat 😭 i will miss y9u
Oh the old intro.. I’m going to miss you so much matpat
This intro put me into a domain expansion of my childhood matpat thank you for ruining my childhood since 2011
Video idea: if you haven’t already, do a theory on who Rosalina’s brother is
I've been watching game theorists for about 7 years, thank you for bringing us happiness! We're gonna miss u Matpat!
Now 8 to go😢
I’m pretty sure the next 8 theories are already slotted out, but, I think it would be awesome to include the new theorist into one of the final theories like an “Ancient Aliens” vibe just to create a fun parody before you sign off. It would be Hilarious
Great theory, but knowing you only have 9 theories left it makes me sad
I honestly can’t wait for the new voice
Farewell matpat
The classic intro oh man I am gonna cry all over again
Until the inevitable day, I will try and forget that he will leave YouTube, and enjoy the last moments we have with him
Thank you for the years of YouTube you’ve given us😢
We’ll miss you man❤❤❤but why  did you have to go?
Im gonna miss you matpat we will all miss you

Mass effect part 2 'PLEASE' I have been waiting 6 years!!!
I’m just wanting to see matpat learn to be a DJ with music man before he’s done.

The classic intro still hits hard. Oooohhhh I love this intro. Will miss you MatPat.❤❤
Matpat has turned unto tompat
the old intro filled me with so much nostalgia, you quite literally saved me matpat, I've always been homeless as a kid and just watching your videos let me have a way to escape, I love your videos, you saved me from suicide so many times with the thought of your newest videos or fnaf theory just always captivated me, I love you man, I really do (also you have the voice of an angel, always wanted to say that)
Matpat -i'll- WE'LL miss you dude
Bro, I miss this theme song. This is part of my childhood.
Their not ruining my childhood but mad it better ❤❤❤ 0:41
Matpat are u coming back for poppy playtime Miss u❤️❤️‍🩹
Don’t Leave
GameTheory i see that you are quiting on march 9th that is 4 days before my birthday can you please make a video of my 10th birthday i will thank you so much please notice this and everyone who sees this like it so matpat can notice  -aiden b foley
Can someone make a ai matpat
Let’s get read for the heavy hitter during march
I honestly think it would be a cool idea with each theory until Matt retires use a slightly older intro. Like progressively use the older ones untill the oldest intro when its the last theory
is Tom doing gtlive too?
Love mat don’t forget him salute another fallen soldier 🫡
I started watching this man when I first got Internet I am glad I did that a choice I wont regret
Matpat don’t go please please 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Yo he made children day and never touched them (it’s that easy)
Im going to feels lost without mat pat😢
Matpat, please don't go. Do you really have to?
mat pat should cover the bunny graveyard again
Where is our geometry dash  theory
we are all gonna miss him
“Ruining our childhood since 2011” more like “running out childhood since 2011”
goodbye matpat 😭😭
f
his last game theory... we lost a real one today guys.
Seeing the original intro made me relive my childhood in a way I didn’t think possible, we’ll all miss you matpat ❤
pres f in the chat for mat pat
I’ve always wanted you to do a theory about the game lost words beyond the page
God bless you mat pat😢😢😢😢😢
God bless you mat pat😢😢😢😢😢
dont leve mat pls dont leve. you got me through 4th grade
well miss pat and that just a theory a game theory bye Matpat well miss you
He is leaving on my birthday😢
We will miss you
not me sobbing because i felt like a kid again and i felt at home 😭😭😭
The l
were all gonna miss you man
I wish we didn’t have to say goodbye. But since we do, goodbye MatPat. Literally my childhood.
That's not the original intro. Come on, go waaaaay back buddy.
I used to watch game theory for a laugh or a smile now when I watch it. It just makes me cry. Because I know Matpat is leaving😢
That intro literally made me cry, this is so nostalgic and we’re all gonna miss you so much.
The intro tho
Wow i didnt even know how I missed the old intro
I actually feel bad for Tom, this is going to be like when Steve left blues clues. It doesn't matter if Tom does a great job or not, he's just not MatPat.
Forget all about those theories to me the most important thing is you being here all of those memories of those videos I can’t right now I’m literally crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I’m not joking like I usually do
I wont be satisfied until he does helluva boss
I. will. miss.   mat pat
do a theory on trailmakers that game has so much undiscovered lore
Hate to break all the “We’ll miss you matpat!”, but I think we actually play as miss mason. In Garten of BanBan 6, sheriff toadster addresses us as “Miss Mason”.
OOOOOOOOOOOH, so that's where stupendium got the idea from.
me too :(
I'm going to miss watching your vids with my son. It's a bonding thing for us and you're a part of it, Matt ❤😢
This has to be a joke.
does anyone know where the footage of the second half of the game is?
1 down 9 to go. gonna miss this guy so much bro.
DONT YOU DARW RETIRE!!! You can’t retire now! You have so much more to do! Please!
Mattpatt, I balled like a baby watching your retirement announcement, it hurts my heart but I hope you always have happiness in your life, I appreciate everything you’ve given to us ❤🎉
Will you do a gd theory although the game doesn’t have much lore as far as I know of
EVERYONE HE POSTED
Don’t be sad guys🥲a wise man once said don’t be sad because it’s over be happy it happened thank you matpat for making the best theories ever❤
Bro I don’t want mat pat to leave please
I dont wanna lose you=(
Hey im not seeing the videos of the of the orther guy
He said classic intro
We will miss you MatPat…💔
After the last theory I might end It all
I'm gonna miss matpat so much!!!!!!!
DO PHINEAS AND FERB FOR THE OG'S
bro trolls us
..and what about those Givanium infants? could the monster in chapter 5 have originally been one of them but the mutated/ turned hellish or grew up?
He should use the 2012 intro for the final video.
0:18 My eyes lit up when he said they were gonna use the old intro- Also it’s sad to see MatPat gonna go but we can’t rely on him forever.
hmmm well as for the dream visions it can also be Sheriff Toadster as he's been with the gang for a while and treated them as friends.. although I think the monster in chapter 5 would make more sense
Please don’t leave😭😭😭😭
Matpat u were rhe one that got me into fnaf dont go😢😢
Matpat you'll be missed by many!
I bet danno is sad :(
That into was amazing
BEFORE HE LEAVES LETS GET TO 20M SUBS
DUDE DONT QUIT PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU, YOU CANNOT JUST HAND IT OVER TO TOM!!!
MATPAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLS DONT LEAVE US😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
MatPat, we will miss you so much n I'll keep re-watching all your old videos😭👍
1st out of 9. We keep inching closer and closer to the day. Thank you mat
OG INROOOO!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳🥳
I remember finding game theory back when it was a niche thing on the MatthewPatrick13 channel
The last theory has to be a fnaf one if not I’ll just be disappointed
I almost cried seeing the original intro
Do not gooo 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

Matpat, you were my entire childhood and ik u will always be missed by everyone, especially me. But rememeber its only a theory.
We love you matpat bye we’ll miss you because sometimes you just gotta let go
MatPat you have been a the best  YouTube channel  for me and my brother
The last game video with mat pat 😢
Youtube will not be the same without matpat
Matthew Patrick the classic oh heck yes
That OG Intro made me rethink my entire childhood :)
Godspeed madpat

CLASSIC INTRO LET'S GOOO!!!!!!! It's been a Crazy ride all the way here! And I can't express enough the happiness this channel has brought me from the ridiculous Chaos of it all!!!
Matt pat we will miss you😢😢
If the last one isn’t FNAF then, what are we going to do……..
I will miss you, Matt Pat
It’s sad  to see you go Matthew Patrick
omg jellyfish are aliens
Goodbye matpat you were my childhood and always will be, we'll all miss you. Always.😢
We’ll Miss You MatPat 😢
I'm definitely gonna miss MatPat. It just won't be the same sad😢
Legacy of Kain plz before you go matpat
Matpat please dont retire you and many others were my inspiration to make a YouTube channel I couldn't have done it without you please don't retire😢😢😢
Sad you have to leave but I still love the old intro
i just look at this one and i just teared up instantly
Quick question matpat where do you see nap nap in the possessed group I’m not saying your wrong but are you saying that there might be more that were taken over that we don’t she because we can only see (sorry I don’t really know there names) the mom and dad bird the cat the jester the werid tortoise and monster mix the teacher and the girl version of nab nab and at the end ban ban
Dont go pls😢
Really wished matpat did theory on lethal company
Im gonna miss matpat
Hi matpat i am your oldest fan i am going miss you i sub to your channel since 2010 today is my birthday, ok that all for me today i see you tomorrow this is (game Theory).
Matpat can you please do a Fortnite theory that'll make me really happy 😁
Remember, it’s a game theory
I will miss watching matpat
Wait matpat whats yoyr real name is it actually matpat (i know its a dum question)
Will you still own film theory? Or food theory.
Matpat actually updated the original intro to have the new style theory colors show up
Hey uh I’m kinda confused but on the last GTlive when you were playing Garten of banban around 23:41 Toadster addresses our Character as Mrs. Mason who is one of daycare workers the child refers to in many of the hand drawn notes
I would have never thought matpat the guy who said sans is ness would make unironiclly have a bit of respect for the euphoric brothers
Thank you for not only cursing but bettering my childhood ❤️ you will be missed by all  That’s the most nostalgic intro ever
what a tragedy that one of matpat’s final theories will be…  (- _ -;) ugh, a garten of banban theory.
9 more theories whith Mapat… im going to missed you man.
I thought he was gonna quit I am so glad that he is not
Don’t retire
Goodbye Matpat
As much as I'll miss Matt, I'm kind of curious as to how Tom's gonna handle the future :o
I’m going to miss you but i’m glad you bought The old intro back i’m still gonna miss you
No not go you can keep going
Matpat plz dont fully leave. I will miss you.
This is crazy …I’ve been watching your videos for years and now your quitting smh I really wish there was a way you could do some theories every now and then instead of not doing them at all ..def gonna suck 😢
HEY DUDE U HAVE BEEN IN YR FOR 10yrs pls do not leaveee plss dontttt u have been my childhood pls no :(
Goodbye matpat you were a hero of fanf miss you to man I appreciated your channel
Will you be in the fnaf 2 movie?
Rokit music man!
I've never heard of this game. But did I watch it because this is the countdown? ABSOLUTELY.
the very last vid needs to atleast have the og og intro of mario running thru the equations eventually jumping to game theory logo the inner 12 yo in me would feel complete
Can you PLEASE do crow 64 again. That was my favorite video I watched
Thank you matpat, for all your dedication and love that you didnt need to put in each one of your iconic videos, you made the childhood of every single one of us here.We will miss you farewell
this channel will never be the same
I love the old intro❤
I love the that he brought back the old intro. I’m to miss it he old game theory. Thank you for everything.
I'm miss you, everyone quits at some point tho
Do you think it’s possible that we could have been the person that started the experimenting? We are looking for a lost child just like the person who wrote the notes. Just a theory.
MatPat realize that you’re leaving YouTube and only love it like you’re my favorite YouTuber and it would be just so awesome if you were a bowl to make on our house theory THACK you so much for making so much theory’s
God I miss that 🤣 😭
Tom will have the empires of ruling the channel
It will never gonna be the same
Love that classic intro! I'm really gonna miss mat pat though it's just gonna feel real different, he's literally every single one of our 18.7 million childhoods.
I am gonna miss this man, this man right here is a childhood but hearing “if I’m handing this channel over we’re bringing back the old intro” made me scream
You will all ways be the theory channel   legend
I wish there was a game theory Netflix show or something

As much as it makes me sad. I really love the Majora Mask themed 9 Theory’s Left. It’s a great call back to old theories. Also, I really love the old intro. So nostalgic!
I miss him so much we should call him   The game theory master
There should be a video that has all version of the original intro, maybe for the last video from MatPat :'c
this is what im waiting for
Are you still uploading on your other channels

Bro he said he quit
Game Theory won't be the same without you MatPat.

Mat Pat. Matthew Patrick.. Oh how we will miss you. Let’s hope that it is truly just a theory. I can not imagine this channel with anyone else! Your name is written all over it. I don’t think I would truly watch the channel after you leave. This year has started with a lot of bad things. Welp, this is one of them! I’m truly gonna be devastated inside, well. Bye bye, Matthew Patrick, the legend.
gonna miss that classic intro even more than I already did
I've been watching this man since I was barely six I'm going to miss him the soldier was a blood-borne  legend it's sad saying one of my most favorite creators leaving hundreds of my childhood was made when he was awesome
Who's the new guy gonna be?(if there is one)
Matpat can you make a theory on gorilla tag for the eighth? 🗣🔥🔥🔥
Everone no body asked mat pat will be missed and idc what you say you can’t change my mind👍👍😤

Matt: "Banban is kinda all of our problem" Me:  This is the first I've heard of it.
Goodbye matpat. 😢
This series has to be a complete joke
I enjoyed seeing the Old intro complete for once
🤌
Can mat pat only do fnaf theory when he passes down 😢😢😢
We will all miss MatPat dearly once he  leaves but we can all agree that as much as he ruined our childhoods, he made them so much better

Hi matpat
Goodbye matpat we will all miss you but like Pokémon you have to leave friends to make more
You guys should make a new intro with all the new game theory episodes to add
no stop please
The 9 theories remaining at the beginning of the video makes me so sad
Thank you mat pat for making my childhood fun and making COVID 19 less boring 😢😊
The old intro hits hard.
We shall all miss matpat
Matt, Pat you need to do a Fortnite video where you do some crazy theory about Fortnite
PLS MAKE THEORY ON BONELAB/BONEWORKS THERE IS SO MUCH LORE
love the OG music
Hey matpat can you please do a theory on class of 09 pls :)
You will always be a legend and will not be forgotten
matpat if you leave, I’m gonna leave too same with Scott if he leaves I’m leaving with him too
I hope the Intro comes back as a main stay just so we can remember matt
CLASSIC INTRO IS PEAK!!!!!!!!!
Mat, we love you, and we'll always remember you. You made a huge impact on so many people's lives, I hope you know that. You oughta be proud.

Bro was my childhood back then now he’s leaving😢
U won't delete the channel right😢
Matpat.. We will always miss you.... Please never forget us.... We love you... Forever and always ❤😭
This is basically the saddest video but happiest the old intro still gives me flashbacks of my childhood and watching you on my tv while my parents would go to work as my babysitter would watch my brother
I can finally rest knowing all of the lights are different colors in the intro 0:25
We will miss you matpat
This is basically the saddest video matpat has made😢
im crying 😭
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! WHY ITS ONE OF 10?! SOME GRDEN OF BANBAN? WHY?

Bro im tearing up
I’m going to miss you mat pat you inspired me to make my own channel and it’s going great so I wish you luck through all these years goodbye
Matpat you are missing out on videos of Brookhaven and BTD6.
Not before doctor who part 3
1/9 videos done.... Hope you do well in your retirement, and just know that the whole internet will miss you. Also i'm so happy you decided to bring back the Og intro for these last few theories. And coloring each one the correct color to the channels is something i've wanted to happen since Style Theory released. We will all miss you MatPat...
Woah
Why did you ever get rid of the classic intro?
The old intro hit me. I absolutely died.
That was Nabnaleena not Nabnab, which could mean he did lose but resisted the mind control plus Jumbo Josh and Stinger Flynn weren't there, but thanks for the nostalgia and I'm going to miss you. :(
I’m gonna miss this internet genius 😭
PLEASE play dysmantle
Love how all the comments are about him departing,shows how much we all love Matpat❤
Banban VI 2023
Losing matpat will be marked as one of the saddest days in yt history 🫡
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE
You better not leave MatPat
i felt the tears come when i hear the classic intro. didnt hit me when he said bye, it hit me when i realized how long its been
Im gonna miss matpat so much despite only watching since early 2023 im alredy hooked
Im gonna miss you matpat :(
Playing the "old" intro made me so happy!
16:55  *Fast and furious music intensifies*

Ohhhhh the blast of nostalgia I got from the intro... I'm gonna miss you matpat!!!
YES THE INTRO
That intro hit harder than it should have. We're all going to miss you MatPat😢
THE ORIGINAL INTRO
i need more kindergarten and sally face now for some unrelated unknown reason
That intro brought me back to
Mat pat needs to finish with a fnaf theory 💥🔥
Im crying rn
Not going to lie i think tom is going to do a great job but I'll miss matpat so hard
Bruh this is what he chose to theori- nevermind im not gonna say anything goodbye mat i will miss you 😢
i think matpats content is better
YES W OLD INTRO
the new intro for tom’s game theory should have matpat as the mastermind evil genius at the end
RIP MATPAT 😢❤❤
I love how literally *no one* is talking about the theory, just how sad they are that MatPat is leaving. I'm going to miss you so much, but I wish you and yours the best in life. ❤
Goodbye matpat
I don't feel haapy seeing him post.. i cant accept that he is not gonna be with us...
Man goodbye mat im sure gonna miss you❤
all i really have to say is, that wasn't nabnab with sir dadadoo at the end of 6 that was the lady one who's name i can't remember, but you can tell because of the glowing bow at the top of her head that lady nab wore, so really nabnab's fate is still a mystery. idk if this changes anything but hey, its something.
Only 9 theory’s left 😢
We cant stop him. He will leave us soon.
Please come back
im gnona miss matpat literally crtying and shakuing rn
do a gorilla tag theory idc if there is the only one
Hearing the OG theme had me headbanging with nostalgia. I'm gonna miss you man, and I wish you the best life. Now, I'm off to rewatch the classic theories.
8 more videos. Before the Legend leaves.
You have been "ruining" child hood since I was born I actually still can't believe that you are leaving 😢😢😢
I'm gonna miss MatPat; I wish him the best in this transition in responsibilities and I wish everyone the best in their new role as hosts :D
Thank you mattpatt for making us smile and working hard to make these videos!!!
In sad why this is happening
Matpat, I hate that these videos because they just all end to u leaving😢
Yes the old intro
Remember it’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY
the old intro hits so hard
Bye mat I'm a big fan
Matpat made a community reference in the first five seconds
I HAVE A THEROY SO AT THE END OF IT WE MIGHT TURN INTO THE PERFECT AND THEN IN GARTEN OF BAN BAN 5 COMES OUT AND THE DAD COMES AND WE RESTART ALL THE WAY BUT WITH US (the perfect child) HUNTING THE DAD OR AFTER ALL FINSHED 5 COMES OUTAND ITS ALL CONNECTED

MATPAT PLEASE DONT LEAVE 😭😭😭
You are my childhood and I mean it
We’ll all miss you Matpat. Thank you for bringing us joy and bringing back the old  intro
i don’t really care for garten of banban but because these are his last episodes.. im watching this like my life depends on it
Do y’all think matpat will start watching game theory and reacting to it like we do?
i swear seeing that old intro is so satisfying
The fact one of the last theories will be garden of ban ban
Last one is gonna be fnaf
THE INTRO’S BACK
9 theories remain.
Dont leave dude!😢 we need more theories!!
I hope there’s one with matpats final thought again
This is were my child hood ends
Matpat will be remembered as the man who solved everything. Scooby-dooby-theory
For your last theory you should use the original intro I'm talking the one you used for your first episode
That into hit hard
You'll be missed Matt pat
Prepare guys before he leaves 🫡
Never thought I would hear this game theory classic
I wanna see the actual classic intro

I actually started tearing up when i saw the og intro. I’m gonna miss you.
My soul hurts knowing I won’t be getting that original flavor matpat LOREEEEEEE
Im so happy they did the classic intro!!
Bye matpat..
God yes the classic intro🥰😭  I swear though I started having a panic attack during the retirement episode because seeing Matpat videos is more affective than therapy at making me feel genuinely happy and I can’t imagine my life without hearing his voice going on and on about theories when I’m sad.  I’m really going to miss your videos man,  you always make it a bit easier to breathe when my anxiety goes off the deep end out of nowhere but I really do hope you get a chance to relax with your family and get some much deserved and needed rest ❤
im kinda happy matpat will leave cause he is cringe
Bye matpat, hopefully you will come back to the internet to see what has it became
it’s going to be so sad watching old videos knowing he’s not on the channel anymore. 😭
Goodbye matpat. You’re going to be a legend just like techno. :) ( 1 of 9 goodbyes )
pls dont leave mat idk u much never watched much of your content but when i saw the vid where u were retiring i cried because i know and the internet knows that we cant lose u 😢
matpat dont leave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All of us will miss you so much and so all the other channels sound very sincere in style theory game theory start on this film theory, game theory, film theory, and style theory, wellness food theory, a game theory, film theory, food theory, style theory, all of the Siri channels will miss each other, no matter how much they’ve been separated
Will you still be in some videos In the future
😢
Can you do one on lethal company
I was scared until I got the noteifacashion
MATPAT YOU BETTER NOT LEAVE >:(
So I guess this channel will die once matt is gone it won't be the same channel and the company that now owns will just become a cooperate entity less personal watch the sub count on this channel and any other theorist channel drop
Matpat,im going to miss you a lot i hated some of your theory but i watched them since your THE theorist i will never forget a legend like you. I did hope you last game theory would be fnaf but im still happy that you posted one last game theory because in the end its just a theory...A GAME THEORY!
pls
do the isel lore next
9 More Theories Everyone, Stay Strong
the old intro actually gave me chills
The classic intro hits so hard🔥
R.i.p 2009 -2024 mapat we all love goodbye😢❤   Will miss you
Why are you giving away your spot
I really don’t want Matpat to go.. even though I don’t watch him a lot, I’m actually really sad… I’m watching all of his old videos now…
When I heard the old intro I got literally chills
This is the mimic imitating game theory because it is a theory in GAME THEORY
mat are you still going to run the other chanels
𝕎𝕖 𝕘𝕠𝕟𝕟𝕒 𝕞𝕚𝕤𝕤 𝕪𝕠𝕦
The other theories won’t be the same I’m sad… not 9 more theories and then the oh is gone
Bro it’s the end of this channel and all he is gonna theorize about is “garten of ban ban” :(
Nine left😢
So I guess this is the end we are all going to miss you
Imma miss u man 😢
Brooo... Before it was technoblade now its matpatt... It really is fast
I loved when he brought back the classic intro. SSSSOOOOOO nostalgic.
We’ll miss you mat pat 😢😢
I just can’t watch any of these videos the same anymore
Literally don't care about this game, only watching for MatPat
Woah this is spoilers because the episode did not come out
I have officially banned myself from watching the goodbye video.      Because if I watch it I can't stop myself from crying.
Oh so matpat is the one taking
I felt like I was 12 again with that old school into. Thank you, Father Pat
Sad😢
Matpat don't  leave us
I was always so sad when I realized they stopped using the intro a while back. Never thought I’d be even sadder when they finally did bring it back☹️
Missed that iconic music
I started watching this channel when I was 8 in 3rd grade, I’m now in my senior year of high school, about to turn 18 a couple days after matoat retires. This man is and was my childhood. Thank you Mathew for everything you’ve done for us. Opening the video and seeing “9 theories remain” was such a realization moment that this is real, he deserves the best and I can’t wait to see what these final theories have in store
The best intro is back.
Im writing this comment to be an evidence that  i once was his best fan 😢
I think you should do one theory every 4 months of just matt pat
Watching theories after matpat leaves wont be the same
Ima miss you 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
man i'm gonna miss matpat. the last theory should be fnaf.
He ruined our childhood to enrich our lives. Gonna miss you matpat
I hope matpat retiring is just a theory...
Can you do Lethal company?
Can we have a rainbow friends theory? :D I don’t mind FNAF too :)
Never have i been interested in tjis franchise, but you put it in such an interesting way.
If you leave I’m going to watch markplier.          Was that the bite of 87?!?!
I didn't even watch the video yet just the opening in my god I miss this opening so much so much nostalgia washed over me at once I'll be here for all nine videos because this channel has been a part of my life for like 12 years i think
I'm gonna miss you Mat
My heart is so broken but so happy for you.
Please play the psychic friend fredbear song 😢
I have been crying  im gonna miss ya
Thats just a theory, A GAME THEORY!
This theory really changes your perspective, doesn't it? I loved the theory and I am gonna miss matpat SO MUCH! we love you!
I've watched this channel since 2016. So I just want to say one thing  We love you MatPat❤
9 more theories left…
We will remember you and the smiles you put on so many people’s faces and the love you changed with your humour and your kindness and words. Have a wonderful life and please remember to be happy and enjoy all the happy memories you have had with us
Bro was my child hood I started watching him when I was three

Hey... Tom is the next host for MatPat's first and biggest channel. MatPat and Tom(Scott) are both taking a step back from YouTube in early 2024. "The Two Toms Tale Theory" would be a nice theory idea.

The intro made me cry I am going to miss Matpat so much

Nunca espere que escuchar la vieja intro me haria sacar una lagrima
Matt, pat although I wish you wouldn’t leave at all but now I wish it’s just make a theory of fnaf again
Hope you would do a zelda or mario or megaman theiry as one of your final theories ill miss you matpatt

Thank you ❤

The fact that out of the 7 or 8 years I've been watching you that this will be one of my last times saying it just a theory a game theory it hurts just know i,ll miss you.
Hey matpat, want to do a Baldis Basics theory?

The old intro!!!!
euphoric brothers hate brazil
At least we will have the channels up and someone to run it
Does anyone else have no idea what he’s talking about and just watching this because it’s the first video of Matpat’s farewell?
Why did you get rid of the starter?
Ik,some of you guys(cry)about your childhood leaving,but,tbh,I think I will this new theorist!
I already know that his last theory will be on fnaf
im gartening my banban to this rn
I will miss you matpad

Will matpat still do film theory sbd food theory?
Should do a crazy parking theory
I beg you to do a lethal company theory
I will never forget this community that you made and will never forget that classic phase “and it’s just a theory, a game theory.
Ahhhh the nostalgia of the intro
I’m sad to say that I have to stop watching game theory it just won’t be the same as It was from the fnaf theories to just being an idle in the community we will miss you
Game theory will never be the same without you Matpat we’ll all miss you
for my birthday mat is quitting.. what a birthday.
I DONT WANT YOU TO GIVE AWAY YOUR CHANNEL
Sorry Matpat but once you quit I am unsubscribing, if you aren't going to do Game Theories then I don't want to hear them
Finally back to the classic intro😁😆
Bring back the real classic intro
How about the other channels?
LETS GOOOO CLASSIC INTRO
Goodbye, mat, you have “educated”, raised and cared for 18+M theorists, and we will continue your legacy, as sad as it is, I’m happy for you, and glad it happened … but that’s just a theory … 🫡👋❤️
Bye bye matpat i love your videos so much
When have 9 theory 😔
"ruining your childhood since 2011"  I'm going to miss ya
Thank you for everything MatPat, it’s been a crazy ride watching this channel over the years, you are the definition of my childhood and. You have had a huge impact on me and everyone else! Anyway, thanks for everything, Godspeed.
Matpat was and still is my childhood. I’ll miss you, matpat.😢 And as they say, you never know what you had until you lost it.
The classic intro hits hard though 😊
THE OLD INTRO LETTSSSS GOOOOO
Matpat has been such a BIG part of all our childhoods.  Super sad to see him go.
Ive got a question about the remaining theories Is it 10 theories per channel or 10 theories overall, cuase i saw there was one over on film theory (btw that actually kinda put some of the episodes to perspective unironically so congrats i guess) and that took the counter down to 9 as we see here. Its not really clear.
thank you madpat, you made mine and many other peoples childhood and i appreciate everything that you have done for us!
I thought matpat retired 😭
…                     .  .  Д
Sorry for asking, but it's getting very popular, so could yall please do a theory on THE LAST MONDAY, a garfield horror game
“Guys, what one is your favorite”
Same
The old intro gave me such a nostalgic chill! Im gonna miss you Matt
I so feel like he should go from the most recent older one to his oldest opening for even more nostalgic feel though— Kinda revert back to the first opening he ever had for it. :p
Please say he reaches 20mil subs before he leaves.
OMG matpat was in the fnaf movie
Mat, we love you, and we'll always remember you. You made a huge impact on so many people's lives, I hope you know that. You oughta be proud. 😊
OH I MISSED THE INTRO SO MUCH
The old intro just made me so glad😊
Matthew I am going to miss you but can you do lore on the Roku purple/blue screen
Matpat you will be missed
Im not crying you're crying
I'm going to miss matpat too.
That old intro still slaps! Throws me back to more simple times. Gotta love it!
I found out yellow I think makes you hungry

My did you waist one of your last theory's on garden of ban ban
Mapat I know you won’t even read this but   Hello mapat I understand that you’re a dad now and you have a family but at least upload  three vids a year  YouTube can be fully ruined without you now goodbye I might see you in the future but bye we will all miss you
Hi again matpat

Opening intro way to nostalgic wow
Matpat unironically ended his channel by leaving.
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE INTRO

Wow… this is matpats final garten of Banban video
My pet please don’t leave YouTube. Your videos are the best please don’t leave.
My birthday is coming up and what i get is news that your retirement is soon. GOD IM SO SAD
I actually cried during the intro
Great start to his final 9 Episodes
got goosebumps from the intro
I MISS THIS INTRO
Thank you for preparing us. Mat 😢
The 9 last MatPat game théories and one of them is garten of banban. Not sure how I feel about this.
During the "old" intro, I couldn't help thinking that it should've been been the og intro. If you know you know.
matapt i wanna ask u a question why are u leaving ur channel
Before you go
Do plants vs zombies theory
Can you do Mortal Kombat please.
Nooo the classic intro 😢this will make me cry 😭
I'm going miss you matpat 😢😢😓😭
IM GONNA MISS U MUCH MATPAT
U know even with the fnaf theories I'm like yeah sure but what were any of those words 💀💀
we are gonna miss you matpat!
Thanks for the childhood, Matt.
As we get closer to the last theory with matpat, they should use older and older versions of the intro
I do have to point out that nabnab doesn't actually get mind controlled on screen. The spider you see at the end of chapter 6 is nabnableena.
Omg man I can’t express how much happiness you gave me. I think I’m just gonna watch your old videos forever 😭
They say all things come to an end… but why like this?
Of course his final videos are just mid ahh theories and are just kids theories
The classic intro is back, let’s go!!!!!!
MatPat you are the reason that teenagers are still watching full length videos, and not devoted to scrolling, you are worth watching. Thanks for the theories and thanks for the memories, you will be missed and your legacy will carry on.
I didnt watch much of matpat era game theory yet i still feel really sad about him leaving
Matpat, this was such a big journey. I'm gonna miss you.
shouldn't have it based on Garten Of Banban though, even if im gonna watch it. not cool move tbh :(
Dont gooooo😢😢
its great that he brought back the old intro
This, Welcome Home & Poppy Playtime are going to be the franchises I wish Matt was around to continue. I know he’ll be behind the screen somewhere but I’ll miss his voice and script
Please dont hand over your channel. Its a big part of evryones childhood
Don't worry, he's still plagued by FNAF.
Bro buff 11:36
why does his last few have to be garten of ban ban
Bro you where my child hood
Bro I thought you left YouTube
hearing the classic intro while knowing matmat has only a few more episodes until we likely never see him making content again  genuinely tugs on the heart strings a little
matpat i will miss you
Got chills from intro
Great to hear the “old” intro again 😊
Loooooooor
That “Hello internet!” Will be missed 😭
GUYS CONVINCE MATPAT NOT TO LEAVE
Let's get him to 20 million subs
Atleast i know it hurts danno but theres a vid he left for all of us before he retires so watch it danno he was ur best childhood yter
I’m jumbo josh brah

Mat pat putting the "Effin" in there as a min swear is funny
You're not crying,  I'm crying.  I so rewatched that opening again
You’ve been part of my childhood since I was 7. I am going to you
MAKE A THEORY ON GORILLA TAG
I miss the times when he would put memes at the end of the video

Where gonna miss you you where a huge part of my childhood I enjoyed all of your videos we will miss you almost more then when we needed to miss technoblade goodbye mat 😢😢
him calling it the "old intro" makes me feel old
The OG intro song
stop. Stop. STOP. STOP!!!!!!!!!
For matpats last vid pls give him 1 million likes❤
Man I wish he stayed but we have to go with flow I wish he made the decision to come back just for one video
OLD INTRO ❤❤
Classic? Mat you forgot the 10 year game theory intro
Bro that intro made me so happy
It's like watching the last 10 games of a pro athlete. Matt you are my Tom Brady!!
Mat pat needs his FINAL video to be FNAF 🥲
We'll miss you MatPat it's crazy to think we're only nine theories away from saying goodbye😢
We will miss you man!!!

If Matpat comes back in 2025, the whole world will collapse
To be sorry but who is mat pat 😅
Where is he goinn???
Goodbye madpat
MAT PLS DONT GO IM CRYING PLSSS
Dam worst thing to hear after it’s my birthday in 3 days

Never thought an intro could make me happy
Bro, this is like the party of 83 with the " 4/3/2/1/0 days untill the party" NAHHHHHHH
Do a toon Turf theory
Matpat you were my whole childhood and i wish you well with your life goodbye ❤
I’m pretty sure he’s going to a more creative position and not the host, although I could be wrong.
Im going to miss Matpat so extremely much…..he was my favourite YouTuber growing up…he was the first person to make me feel comfortable with sharing things I find interesting…share his theories with his friends and also interesting facts I learned from him and his video   Mat and steph will always be in my heart and all ours even if his old videos are still up…I want them to be so so happy , I wish them nothing but the best for him and his family ❤
YOUDONT NEED TO DO THIS DON'T LEAVE DON'T LEAVE THE CHANNEL
You created basically all of my personality. All the fandoms, the way I speak… ect, ect
THE CIRCLE IS FINALLY COMPLETE
you should do the vr game gorrila tag its got a secret🤫
Don’t leave 😢😢😢🥺
I love your vids man their amazing. Btw I don't think nabnab was mind controlled by dadado. It looks like nabnalina.
This video is so bittersweet I’m glad to see the old intro and seeing matpat make theories before he leaves 🥲
Rip
Classic intro? Witty MatPat? I’m going to miss this so much. :(
Pls don’t quit 😭😭
We'll miss you MatPat it's crazy to think we're only nine theories away from say goodbye
I don’t like garden of banban but it’s matpat
RIP My Childhood, Goodbye Matpat
I wish they could keep the original intro it's so fun to see
No joke when I say this, seeing the original intro I grew up on I smiled and nearly cried. We love ya MatPat!
Matpats final theory needs to be a fnaf theory
Ahhh clasic intro yey <3
DON'T HAND OFF YOUR CHANNEL PLEASE😭
When Matpat leaves I am unsubscribing as well
my bio on anything will be thats just a theory a game theory AAAH
Having banban being one of the last ten videos is…kinda sad honestly
no ones happy in the comments anymore lol
1st theory: Garten of BanBan
What.. I was going to say supercell confirmed a family tree for the kings and that there is clear lore but I think that’s not possible to do anymore. Those who watch you will greatly miss you
the hits to my nostalgia are *IMMENSE*
Classic intro let's go
what if captain fiddles is nabnab's kid,  in the dream with the buses (they might be school buses which to a parent means loss of control over your kid). So NabNab tries to save it's kid from the world by running after the bus but is unsuccessful. It also makes since for NabNab to be a parent since it has instinct to protect others like a loving mother would.(and in the file it says captain fiddles is the most like a toddler)
matt will be remembered through history as the most insane theorist to ever touch our childhouds with his finger of unreal, mindblowing "glamrock freddy is micheal afton" fnaf insanities of theories. thank you matpat
my man put the foundations of fnaf lore i can't believe he will retire
I love you matpat! You will never be forgotten!!!! ❤
We’re all going to miss Matpat
wonder what matpat is going to do after all this cause this is essentially a retirement yet he still got a kid to raise
We’ve gotta get Matpat to 20mil now
2:00 banban feels like getting hit with a bus multiple times 😂
Can you please do a theory vid on Oneshot?  Ive asked like 20 times, and while i dont expect you to do a theory on Oneshot, I would still very much like to see one.
Seeing this into is gonna make me cry
I heard the old game theory intro and yelled "YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!" so loud, everyone looked at me, but no regrets
This channel started my sophomore of college wonder what it been like if I discoverer it then and not in 2017
I literally got so exited when I saw the old intro
Everyone chant for Mat Pat to stay
You will be missed, So many large youtubers that have to do with games would not be here without you go on soldier😖🫡😖
Mattpat I have a question will you still be on the show sometimes or are you leaving forever
I missed the intro So MUCH!!! RIP MatPat...
Babe shut up grandpapat uploaded
Don't go plsssss
I have a theory. Knowing MatPat this is not a permanent retirement. It might be a long temporary one (8-10 years) or he will make some videos on the theorist channels (not lots, a small amount.)
GARTEN OF BANBAN💀💀
YESSSSS THE CLASSIC INTRO
"Did you get the Intros Back: Yes" - " What did it cost: everything"
Only OG fans are allowed to bop to the original intro 🫶
I love matpat
WHY AREW YOU LEAVINGFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG😭😭😭😭😭😭
The last theory should be one last FNaF theory.
Matpat is the best.I am sad your leaving. If your seeing this please make a theory on gorilla tag🙏
Something tells on the last theory he’s gonna use THE ACTUAL classic intro
Back to the classics. I love it.
Mattpatt: guise im weaving 😢  Also mattpatt: 9 vids before i quit because i need that yt revenue  Top tier comedy
Gorilla tag

We’re all gonna miss Matpat so much.

Hope you Remeber me when youll be missed🫶
CAN U MAKE A VID ON OMORI IN ONE OF YOUR LAST VIDS? PLEASE
The classic intro slaps HAARRDDD🗣️🔥🔥
Nostalgia happened with that old intro
Can the last vid be about the fnaf😢😢
We have to forget the fact of him leaving we just have to savor the flavor of the remnant of game theory
Everything makes me feel weird because I know that soon I won't be able to watch any of his videos anymore without getting a little sad
Thank you for bringing back the GT theme song even if just for now. That was always a pleasure to hear every video and felt like a strange loss when it vanished. I still don't understand why it and the other theme songs were removed when they're so short, but I'm sure you have your reasons. Still looking forward to hearing the style theory theme.
I’m gonna miss you matpat :(
The last theory being a fnaf theory would be so sick to see
Yes!! Classic intro❤❤❤❤
That intro is such a classic.
I want a A FULL sONG OF THE oRGINAL iNTRO AS  tRIBUTE TO MAT WHEN HES lEAVING AFTER EVERYTHING
We will all miss you matpat
Oh my God, the intro brings back the old one I'm crying.😢😢
Imagine every episode until his last it uses an older version of the intro as a way of remembering the evolution of the channel
Gonna miss matpat so much
8 videos left on this one
make a video of you singing my way plz
THE OLD INTRO!!!!!
Last video shall be fnaf
Pls i want to watch 1 last video about minecraft theory with matpat voicing it pls just 1 more theory about minecraft with matpat pls 😢
That classic intro gave me so much nostalgia 🤩 0:39  I’m really going to miss matpat
Sees the old intro* *Happy face*
pls MatPat don't goooooo
You are leaving in 9 episodes, and your 10th is a garten of Banban theory?  With all due respect Mr Patrick I do not enjoy your videos anymore. I used to be ecstatic to sit down and watch them exited at a new theory but now ive just slipped out of your target demographic. I guess this goes to show the fate of most on youtube.
9 theories left, until matpat starts a new era. thanks for giving my childhood theories ;)
Do you lot think the channels will die? I hope not.
it feels weird wanting to say i love matpat because i dont really know him that way but i love the way his videos have changed my childhood and made me happier over the years so in a way i do love matpat
Can you do a theory on let's find lady P.s it's a horror game
Also a year ago on food theory you said you where the new host and we sent you a letter
im officially crying again
Seeing the old intro makes me almost want to cry
UTTP Sucks

I'll miss you matpat when you leave. Well not leave but you know what i mean
Don’t we also get confirmation that we are playing as “Ms. Mason”? Could be a different Mason from the Dr. Mason mother of the child but we could be playing as the doctor and that explains why we have to stay because we could possibly understand a cure to correct all of this Givanium mess.
Ièll miss you, Mat.
😭 😭 😭
9

The true Thank you is for having made not only my childhood but also my sisters. It’s only been 5 years for them but they found you at the same age I did. It’s like looking me but in a different font. I get so excited whenever we see something new and we can all come together and watch a video and come up with our own theories. We’re gonna miss you Mat💚 (that’s not a theory)
😭 the old intro
Now all the comments on the newest videos are going to be missing MatPat.           Thank you for all the memories MatPat.

I will miss you, but I am happy for what comes next
to matpat, just remember that we all love you and we all will miss you.
gona miss you man
Anyone waiting for this whole “ 10 theories left “ thing to be an arg
I’ve been watching game theory since elementary school next year I’ll be a senior in high school so knowing matpats going is insane
Well, atleast he still does theories before he quits.. We will miss you matpat.
What is Mat will take a break for game theory put will come back in the future? That’s my theory
Bro casually made one of the biggest channels on YouTube and then just dipped
Thanks for giving me joy since your link is dead video, I really enjoyed all of your videos the last few years and I really hope you the best down the line. And I really hope that we’ll still be seeing you every once and awhile or maybe a random matpat episode in the future. But hey, that’s just a theory, a GAME THEORY thank you Mat.🥲
Same I’ll miss you mat
Him pausing it and swtching to the old intro dudeeee
Going to miss Matt Pat, so much who he is like who are used to watch every single day why is he retiring?
Tom if you see this try to treat these channels right
the explosion at the end 💀
THE END OF THE VIDEO- THE CUT OUT I CANT
🥲
Ima miss you so much matpat, but if this makes you happy then I support you
goodbye friend 😢
PLEASE make a baldi's basics theory before you quit
The last theory needs to be a Fnaf theory
I didnt have it in perspective how much this is going to hit me until i heard the og intro. I'm gonna miss you man.
I hope matpat makes a vlog channel
I was so happy when heard that intro
Matpat can't u just be in videos but not doing the theories can't we just see you in vids?
Does anyone else see that when zovius (sic, giant head) is looming in the sky, it’s a reverse image of a child playing with toys? Maybe your child turned into the failed experiment of the perfect child, and he’s trapped there playing with toys they’ve made. Maybe they’re supposed to be ‘living toys’? Or they are mascots and he’s just SKYSCRAPER huge. (Edit: I was ONE SCENE from reading the letter that literally says “he plays with them like they’re toys” so I’m counting it as a win for myself because I didn’t know that before!)
I miss you matpat 😢😢😢😢
Me too
god it Hard to come to this Channel know HELLO and WElcome to Game thearoy and  it not mat I feel what happened when Steve Left Blues Clues
Thanks for carrying my child hood matpat, also yes you brought the best intro ever back!

Hey MatPat. Thank you so much. I'm gonna miss you dude! Definitely have as much fun doing what you love can't wait for your new stuff! Love you dude!

I like how most of the comments aren't not about the theory itself

goodbye Matpat
Thanks for the old intro
im so sad that hes leaving. I was super sad when technoblade passed, even though i never watched him, but matpat is my childhood. I would tell my friends and family about every theory i watched. We will miss you
I loved his Bendy theories :( why does he have to leave I loved him and still do, oh what a cruel world we live in why world WHY
Ima miss matpat but thats just a theory
I thought I wouldn’t be sad and then you just had to play that old intro… going to miss you Matt!

7:49 where is nab nab that’s naballena

"running your childhood since 2011" at the end of the intro hits hard
I’ll miss you so much matpat I really hope that you somtimes make a video every few months you were my child hood
your the best matpat
I hope we see matpat soon one day he will come back
The intro made me cry 😭😢
The true nightmare is this game
matt pat make a blogging channel please
I just realized the colours of all of game theory, food theory, style theory and film theory r the same colours of all the Hogwarts houses
I thought it was a 69 theory
Omg what's gonna suck is that every video will be matpat slowly going away
Same here don’t quit pls mat pat
I DONT WANT HIM TO LEAVEEEEEEE T-T
I wanna remind everyone how gta 6 will have some amazing theory’s to create and they won’t be from matpat😢
im pretty sad seeing matpat leave but atleast we get some final theories before he quits
Petition for matpat to sing “it’s been so long” before he leaves
not me crying over him leaving.
dang that classic intro hits hard
Bros last theory is on garden of ban ban 💀
The uttp has invaded mat again
You know your old when they say that *that* is the classic intro..
😢🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
im kinda mixed on one of the last ten theories being on this game, never really understood why anyone likes it...
Plz do shorts war season 2 before you leave too

17:46
The old song made me cry
The intro is so nostalgic❤😂❤
i thought he left
YEAAAAAAAAAH THE INTROOOOOOOOOO
Nem pra ser de um jogo bom
- 8 remain-
I know there are only 9 theories left, but why did one of them have to be from Garden of Ban Ban?
Only 9 theories left and he decided to make a theory about this garbage series again.
I hâte tom
I really don’t want you to go
Gonna miss matpat man
I always knew this day would come. And I am still not ready for it dad pat.

8 theories left guys... Lets use as much as we can 😞
Matpat matpat matpat, you know what would be funny, if you made your last theory a fnaf one and make us all cry, I always thought your fnaf theories made no sense, but I enjoyed them, even though I didn’t get them, Matpat you made so many childhoods, so many silly fnaf theories,thank yiu matpat, and remember it’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY!
I’m going to cry
Classic intro leeeeets goooooo
CLASSIC MATPAT INTRO RAHHHHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its gonna be =3 all over again 😢.
We finally have the full circle, but at what cost
1 theory down 8 more to go..
Garten of BanBan was the perfect round one of the final 9 imo, I’m not ready for it to be over
Internet just won’t be the same without you matpat .
Possibly the last video by matpst 😢😢😢😢
We Love you Matpat
im gonna miss mat
the og intro just hits differently
Wait...is matpat gonna make it to Poppy Chapter 3?
We Love you Mat
When march comes I'll just watch his previous videos all over again😢
the last game theory.
I’m really gonna miss you matt
I got giddy when bro did the classic intro
We’ll all miss you Matpat. Thank you for bringing us joy and bringing back the old  intro ✨
It's taken me a bit to come to terms with matpat leaving, he not only ruined my childhood, but he also rebuilt it, we're all going to miss you mat and Steph, I wish you both a happy life
*What a legend.*  *That’s all I have to say. Well miss you.*
Matpat, please make your last theory a FNAF one
Ty matpat for the video
Me: "2024 is gonna be a great year!" MatPat: "Nah, dude"
It feels like a fever dream honestly
Can you make a video on chapter 3
We are gonna miss you somuch Mat
You will be missed
MATPATTTTTTT
garten of banban is jesus christ theory
CLASSIC INTRO ROCKS!
CLASSIC INTRO ROCKS!
It’s sad to think i stopped watching for a while because i got so busy with life and now we’re 9 episodes away from MatPat leaving. I’m gonna miss you MatPat, your my childhood
Matpat I hope the best for your dad journey I will miss your theory
I am 13 I have been watching your videos since I was 3 you are my childhood I loved seeing a new video pop up after school
Old intro hit different i was gonna say make history theroy before goodbye internet
i openly yelped in excitement when matpat said “old intro” that i scared my dog
Hi, I'm using my mum's account to ask if  you can do a theory about uncharted. Last year I was playing loads of uncharted and it has become one of my favourite video games and I heard a theory that uncharted and the last of us are in the same universe since you can find the same bar from the first chapter in uncharted 3 in the last of us.
Not the classic intro man, dude has me cryin on nostalgia 😭
We will miss the lord of the lore
A cool idea that they could do; use an older opening for each theory, I think it'd be quite nostalgic for us but just a suggestion
It’s on chapter 6 I still remember when everyone hated chapter 2
I love how i can't see a single comment about the actual theory or banban in general.
🔥
I'M GONNA MISS U BRO
Bye matpat looks like this the end 😢
I’m really gonna miss mat-pat  He always ruin my childhood but in the best possible way
Don't give them too much credit MatPat. Especially by creating another controversy.
Matpat, i'm gonna miss you a lot but i do think team theorist put way more thought into banban than the euphoric bros themselves
Thank you for everything matpat genuinely, fnaf is not gonna hit the same without you
Is just a theory a game theory goodbye mat pat
Why are you leaving please stay we miss you 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Dude I feel like a kid again— opening up my laptop, getting home from middle school to watch Game Theory as soon as I could. That old intro gave me a serge of happiness. Oh Matpat, we are going to miss you.
I’m gonna miss matpat your videos were the reason why I started my channel I’m gonna miss you
the way I SCREECHED when the og intro came on 😭
matpat  if you are reading this are you just giving this to tom or all of your channels to tom and are you going back to your acting creer or  are you gonna make a new channel with new stuff
My god I miss this intro!! 😇😊🫶🏽
You are really taking me back Matpat 😭
Why am i a doctor in this and banban
loved seeing the intro
Don’t go
I can’t believe that there’s only 9 theory’s left…
the nostalgia from the intro
We’re gonna miss ya😭😭
it is not just a theroy it is a game theroy created by a legend
*This situation is so sad yet I wish you all the best in life. We’re gonna miss you a lot, Mat.* 😔
CLASSIC INTRO !!!!!
CLASSIC INTRO GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I have no words only emotions🫡🫡🫡
Currently crying while watching
No it’s not we love Garten of Banban so to bad we love Garten of Banban so hah
I will miss matpat he’s just so familiar
Dude you should totally do slenderman as a final theory. It would be so awesome
1/9
Stinger sounds more like Adam Driver than Adam Driver himself.....
omg the classic intro just hits just like it used to
I'm so glad he put up the old intro. It just feels right.
We need the final petscop theory
Can one of the 9 theory’s be that it was just a joke? That you’re not really leaving? If you don’t want to do that I need something from you, one last fnaf theory.
I LOVE THE OLD INTROOO❤❤
say bye to him the legend
👋 goodbye 😅😢😮🎉
Like for matpat being missed 😭 👇

This is what you use your last ten theories on matpat? Don’t torture yourself!
Matt Pat you have to promise me something please cover hazbin hotel. It comes out on the 19th. And by the looks of it, it will come out by your second to last theory.
That intro hit hard 😭
Please make a video revolving around the roblox game Deepwoken. Its deep
We’ll miss you matpat, we will truly miss you ❤❤❤
This is about to be history when your gone matpat
He was the best. We will miss you😢😢😢😢
If they are bringing back the old intro, would anyone else find it awesome to have the "Super amazing end card tournament" once more ?
i hope he's doing all of this for a joke or attention, you didn't "have" to leave us
I’m going to cry when Matpat leaves
Looking forward to Tom! I'm ready for a new chapter in this channel 🫶
mat pat theorizing in the morning!!!
That intro takes me back, I loved that song so much. Curse you YT for punishing longer intros in videos.
WHY GARTEN OF BAN BAN FOR UR LAST THEORIES!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

thank you so much matpat for carrying my cild hood we will miss you <3
Im going to make a video about you matpat.
I'm gonna miss you so much and that's not just a theory
Never expected a nerdcore music channel to be namedropped in a theory, but here we are. Haha!
It's sad to hear you to go we all love you matpat!❤
Me too
Man I did not expect the old intro we will miss matpat
Mat pat you helped me graduate highschool without even knowing it thank you mat you've helped so much I'll miss you brother.
I hope this is a prank so bad😢
What about poppy playtime chapter 3?
Make a theory on the baby in yellow
Its not gonna be the same without mat
Hi MatPat! Before you go, can you make one last theory about this local 58 video that came out a year ago about an “asteroid mission”, if not that’s ok 👍
We will miss you  😢
I love this intro
I can’t believe this is the 2ND Matpat video I have ever watched, not first, second.
I don’t even play Gartan of Banban but I will miss this channel so much that I am just watching it with no clues whta is going on I am not missing one of the last videos
It’s not gonna be the same without Matpat
Welp mathew patrick is gonna be gone in a few theories ima miss him
Wow he posted garten of banban theory as one of his lasts
Maybe were bitter giggle in the Drem secrets😮
So…is the perfect child zolphious or the other one?
I just read the last 4 videos and oh. my. god. "The big reveal? Broke the internet. Remember your past." Put it all together, "the big reveal broke the internet. Remember your past." Matpat was hinting at him leaving for the past four videos. He thought we would peice it together. BUT THATS JUST A THEORY.
I don't know if I'm going crazy or something but maybe for his last 10 theories line up with how many letters are in game theory and the first name of the game he did was Garten of banban so maybe he is aligning the games he is theorizing about with the letters of "game theory"
i though u where done with videos
Don't go matpat
Sir dadado didn't get to chase us
Mathew pathew doing one of his last theories on ban ban is like if the one true god was named Bradler.
Like this comment if your sad about matpat leaving amd grew up on him
8 left 😭
The intro really reminded me of "dokie dokie" theory series
Horrid idea: I know: but what if our child was used to create that one worm
20 million subscribers before matpat passes the mantle
Imagine if one of the final 9 theories is a petscope video. I would actually scream
Classic intro is a big heck yes from me
What if his last theory is about who caused the bite of ‘87
when your channel started i was 5 i was with my older brother on the internet when we saw one of you videos and just clicked. ever since i have been watching all of your videos and i mean ALL OF THEM . i was obsessed i was that one girl in high school who wouldn't stop talking about FNAF theories.  i turned 18 10 days ago an have quite literally grew up watching your videos. as i'm sad to see you go I'm also happy that the channel is still going on and that we might still see you sometimes. thank you so much for being my childhood Mattpat you will be missed.
I just love that old intro bring so much memory :)
We love you Matt thank you for make our childhood special and interesting and teaching us that all things have so much more up under the surface face value hope we can see you every once in a while as a special guest

God, I love the epic intro theme!
Tom's voice is 🔥🔥🔥
Matpat. Please. Have the happiest life ever. You so deserve it for all your work
Man Matpat is gona be gone is so hard
Can you make one last doki doki literature club theory please.
Oh shiiiiiiiii

We are all gonna miss you, a lot. But you have your map to your beach, follow it Mat!
HES BACK!!
We'll miss u
How you bring MatPat back already?
This retirement is ripping out my heart strings 💔 😢 😔 😪 😞 😭   we shall all miss you 😢
New guys got a nice voice, I'm excited to see from him in the future.
will MatPat ever visit the channel, like, for special occasions?
We are gonna miss you Matpat:(
I’m gonna miss you so much matpat. So much
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
God that opening hit like a truck
Why is everyone so sad in the comments? I know matpat is gonna go but... Are any of you actually enjoying these last videos?
Do fnaf
My theory on the channel matpat will still make theory if not every fans crying rn I'm there
Never gonna forget matpats voice
The game theory intros always slap hard
Lets salute to MatPat o7 0:01
The channels not quitting, but he is he’s handing it over to someone else
We will miss u ur a true legend our childhood memories
To our person that we love our theory’s from, we love you❤
im going to miss matpat so much, he will always be a goat
do minecraf loor ther is new loor for Minecraft
The classic intro made me tear up man!!!!
i think matpat should make a video about the new poppy playtime chapter
Man the song hets hard
0:26 NO WAY ALL FOUR LIGHTS ARE COMPLETED
Though we are all sad please don't carry sadness in every video. Save it for the last theory
For your last theory video make it themed around every single games series you've done it on like do mario, fnaf, poppy playtime, banban and every single other game series you've done game theory on all in 1 video.
This brings me memories
I think the original plot has just been buried underneath LORREEEEEE
I’m crying right now
Yessss that intro is amazing. Thank you so much matpat 🎉
on march 9th you better say "but that's just a theory"
MatPat, PLEASE DO ALEX RIDER ON FILM THEORY ALSO USING THE BOOKS
21ch 144kl
Pls do one last theory with *rick and morty*plssssss🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Day 2 of saying sans is ness until matpat tragically leaves
I just cried. I’m gonna miss you so much.
Please don’t leave. Ummmmmmmmmm take a year off anything except for retirement I want Ollie to be a future theory
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS THE INTRO!!!! i've missed that one so much
I really hope the matpat quitting thing is a pre april fools joke
YES IT IS BAK
That into
Mat wants to go out while he is on top, I can respect that. But I have a theory, a boycott theory. If we stop watching and tank the rating he won't be on top anymore.... I'm totally kidding, I've been watching mat since the start. I'm gonna miss this guy
Matpat inspired me but I don't know here start how to start and when to start    But I have only been watching him for like 3 or 4 years     Am I still a theorist     I don't think that I am a part of matpat
Why does the classic intro hit so hard I'll miss it
;(
Man that intro is mint 9.
I can't believe this Intro so happy
We’re all gonna miss this
We miss you mat
I really hope MatPat makes some big ARG for his very last video voiceover
I'm gonna miss him so friggin much omg I can't
I'm aware everyone is saddened by matpat retiring but i think we should find a way to cope and move on while still remembering him and still appreicate the videos of the game theorists without making it all just about matpat, i think we shouldn't fill the comments with 'i miss matpat' 'i wish he didn't retire' etc. And instead watched their theories and gave appreciation to all of the theorists while still kept matpat in our mind. But as i said before i don't think we should spam the comment section with everything off topic and just about Matpat retiring. I miss matpat dearly although we still have to move on eventually and not dwell on it <3
We're all gonna miss you you're  gonna be in my heart I will listen to you everyday I could listen to all day And if you remember this video great But do you remember your phone guy Fnaf The musical That's all I have to say I'm gonna miss you we're all gonna miss you

THE LAST THEORY BETTER BE FNAF
I can’t believe one of Matpat’s last videos were about this horrible, terrible, cash-grab, no-effort ‘game’   Still, he somehow manages to make it entertaining. Thank you, Matpat.
The classic intro brings back memories ,I’m going to miss you doing game theories MatPat

I love your therioes matpat can't wait for more therioes in the future ❤❤
That intro hits different in 2024. Matpat will be missed. 9 theories remain

If I watch this video again and see the classic intro, I will cry
well all miss you matpat, you where my childhood😭😭
Game Theory Is best
I wonder if I'll still like theory videos. Gotta keep an open mind. So many of the team I enjoy will remain, after all.
I've been watching MatPat ever since 8th grade (for reference I graduated college last May) and to know he's leaving... I get it but also I'm gonna miss him :( he'll still be around I know but like... Dang
No, we’re all gonna be sad my map at leaves, but do you know iPad that with nab Alina, not napping now, but if you see the growing spine, it was flat, not a birthday hat it was not a birthday hat
We'll miss you MatPat, thanks for making such great theories even on things such as Garten of Banban
Matpat please don't quit
Bro has the infinity stones in the forms of theory channels (btw I’m gonna miss you matpat)
It’s just a theory a game theory thank you for whaching
Hey matpat before you leave make a lethal company theory video
oh. the classic intro. how dare you. 😭😭
8 more episodes to go 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The classic intro….. man 😓I’m ready depression
I'm gonna miss matpat
There ls still hope for game theorys revamped
so are the monsters that first appear evil or not?
I am gonna miss you so much love you forever ♾️😭😭❤️❤️
Thank you so much for making videos for 10 years straight and having sleepless nights and putting work first so again thank you your videos are my childhood thank you
Why are you retiring 😭😭😭😭
Yo dude, bye.
Omg
we need a lethal company game theory video
We miss matpat and more YouTubes so sad see ogs YouTubes quilting ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
do the slenderman theory
idea: last theory has the ever first intro, quality and humor
matpat we miss you
I feel like Garten of Banban exists in some sort of multiverse void between all mascot horror games; it would explain a lot about this weird combination of poorly executed mascot horror tropes
I’ve never seen or heard of a banban but matpat decided to ruin my ignorance before he dipped from the internet
The explosion in the end 😂
Transforms into a giant Dark souls boss 💀
We'll miss you buddy ❤
Me to
we will never forget you matpat you will live in are memory forever
Nabnab didnt get mindcontrolled, it was Nabnaleena
10:46 sister location wall texture
After all of the theories, I never thought that you have never had the idea of my singing monsters, It’s been 10 years since my singing monsters, and to this day, you havent done a theory about it. Even if you don’t do a My Singing Monsters, its ok.
hiii theory
less gooooooooooo the classic intro
Its game theory!
The nostalgia from the intro
Matpat was in my top 2 favs i will miss him
Day 4: Another day without the "final/fairwell" merch
2:46 CHOO CHOO CHARLES!!!!
Not me crying at the classic intro lol
Well 8 videos left before we  say bye matpat 😭😢😭😢😭
Matpat imma follow ur footsteps imma start my own 4 channels see u later
❤❤❤❤❤u matpat
I can’t believe I’m saying this after 15 years but goodbye mat pat
MatPat when you give all the Channels to others then all videos will stay or not?
🎮 =rip matpat
Losing matpat is like losing your favorite teacher which gets replaced by another teacher that doesn’t get you as much as the old one, we’ll miss you.
farewell soldier you have done ur duty
5 theories remain
We gonna miss you MatPat:(
I'm not going to watch the goodbye video It would make me way too sad
You really will be missed, ive never watched you ever. But my big brother has always watched you even in 2020. So thank you Bye
The og theory intro 😭 i almost forgot about it
The fact that all those characters names are Actually names is WILD!
We are gonna miss you matpat😭
But hey it's just a theory a game theory thanks for watching him we will miss him a lot
we will miss you
Bringing back the OG intro was a huge dopamine hit
Everything has to end at one point….
We will never forget you matpat
The classic intro keeps  making me simile, but being reminded of matpat's retirement keeps making me frown
Fnaf gonna bring back mat watch
8 Theories Left.
Will all of the old theories still be on the YouTube account?
day 3 of asking matpat for geometry dash theory, i am going to touch you if you won't do that theory 😘
Goodbye matpat
8 theories remain…
Matpat really makes my day on every channel I am really going to miss him😢😢
The cycle of life — Matpat goes, leaving behind a land fit for several others.
Guys it’s okay it’s all over,have fun with the last 9 theories,goodbye matpat,you made my childhood better
I cried when he said he was retiring when I saw this video I jumped out of my bed ran through my brother's room and started screaming that he still has 9 videos because you were me and my brother's childhood🤭😱👋BYE MATPAT
Im gonna miss mat
I will miss you bro i'm about to start crying we will remember you
Matpat atleast show your face not in every video but one of them. when tom is doing the video now atleast show your face in one of them😢😢❤❤
We love you too matpat. We always will. We'll miss you and always will
matpat will u just be on game theroy live?
i really hope you guys even if without matpat (goodbye😞) do a Ultrakill theory like "can a coin actully a reflect bullet" or something like that
I'm sobbing 😭
I think it would be a cool idea to do the fnaf night sound everytime you count down ur therories
on march 9 (when matpat is saying goodbye to his channel and us) its my birthday. For me  its the worst birthday present for my birthday /:
8 to go...
Yup, it is the end of MatPat in Game Theory...
😭
I ain't watching after matpat leaves the channel
you should do "Buckshot roulette" next. also I'm gonna miss you mat.
Thus is my childhood
Honestly I just hope he comes back for fnaf theory’s or gt live
Matpat wasn’t in my childhood he is my childhood
He’s trash
The last words of a legend is a theory a game theory
I remember that intro hahaha 😂❤
Matpat 😢
im gonna miss Matpat so much 🙁
8 left
matpat pls don't leave i can't watch your videos without getting upset..
On the last episode, you guys should start an ARG. Send fans to hunt down MatPats “missing theory”. Our reward could be like one more theory in a year or something
FINAL THEORY IS FNAF
G7d I'm gonna miss ya matty! Wish you the best of luck in all your gonna do pal

That Intro Was Nostalgic
Him bringing back the classic intro like a sudden bait and switch made me so much happier than I thought

everyone lets call it"MatPat's Divine Nine" instead of his final ten
Dont leave us

I’m going to miss MatPat so much!! Although before he goes I want him to take another look at Just Dance lore, there is a lot lol 😂

Issue with theory: if we are the green kid then zolphious couldn't exist because zolphious is the green kid as mentioned in the video
0:22 H
I’d like to see MatPat chip in every once in a while. - even if it’s once a year where he makes a video.
16:11
Please make a shorts wars season 2 theory, if you’re going away forever, you better do this
it feels nice having that old intro again
Oh, how I’ve missed the intro 💚
Please don’t leave dude, we absolutely love you
The classic intro 😭 going to miss you so much MatPat
PLEAAaaAAAAase
PLEASE DONT LEAVE
I have to say something i will miss matpat and that i will miss the old intro as well goodbye.
Please tell me he's gonna do like a 3 hour long final theory covering every single ounce of FNAF just for the final memes
Hearing the Gt old intro is amaizing
While I've watched game theory for nearly 13 years, more than half of my life, and will miss Matpat dearly - I really LOVE Tom and I'm very excited for his Theories!
We're gonna miss you matpat, but we all hope you enjoy your life after retiring<3
Make a theory about brawl stars Starr park cctv please❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lets enjoy these moments while we still can
I am sad about MatPat going away but he brought back the original theme song this is my dream come true still going to miss you mat Pat but please keep the original theme song😢
PRAYING FOR THE FILM THEORY CLASSIC INTRO😭😭😭
I have been here at the start and I will still be here in the new beginning.
Would poppy playtime 3 come out before mapat leave ?😢😢
I don’t want matpat to go..
Im so old that i remember this Channel being named “Game Theory” instead of “The Game Theorists”.
CLASSIC INTRO IN 2024!!!!!!
Im making a lyric cover of the game theory intro
he with 9 theories remaining can u actually do one on the fortnite storyline (very cringe ik) its actually very interesting (and cringe)
𝕎𝕖𝕝𝕡 𝕟𝕠 𝕞𝕠𝕣𝕖 𝕞𝕒𝕥𝕡𝕒𝕥😢
MISS MASON IS BANBALEENA!!!!!! SHERRIF TOADSTER CALLS HER THAT IN CHAPTER 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please make this a mini video\short😊😊😊😊
😞It will never be the same after the new generation. Matpat,captainsparklez and other youtubers.
when I was younger I thought I was the only one that knew the springtrap funko pop twitched when it zoomed in at the screen Im gonna miss this guy
I HAVE MISSED THAT INTRO SONG FOR SO LONG. MY CHILDHOOD CAME BACK AND HIT ME WITH A TRUCK
I'm gonna miss Mat, but bring on TOMMMMM the brit in me needs that accent to rise and our phrases to confuse the americans.
is there a chance that you will to a theory on shipwrecked 64? I mean it's a suggestion
When he said classic intro i was fully expecting to see a mario sprite start running across the screen lol
7:48  Just to clarify, NabNab did not fall victim to Sir Dadadoo’s mind control (that’s a sentence I never expected to type), you can see from the bow that this is NabNaleena, his female counterpart that ditched him in BanBan 3. I’m also fairly certain that the teaser for 7 shows Giga NabNab lying on the floor. Which is cool because he’s probably my favourite character design of this far (although to be fair the bar isn’t exactly high)  Edit : okay nvm it was actually in the Banban 6 trailer but whatever you got the idea
T H I S   T H E O R Y   I S   I N S A N E
I am not even interested in this game, I am here for mat
Literally every youtubers upload something after saying they're quitting 💀💀
14:05 "hes mad about it😃" Ya think?
lets get get the channel 20 mil subs before matpat leaves
"This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?" 🤠🫡 *- Old Joseph Joestar (JoJo, Part 3)*

i just can't belive it..Half of my life watching you man..Feels unreal
remember there was spanish to english dictionary at the beginning? well matpat did'nt hear it but in a previous game, Zolphius says I'm sorry in spanish. ''lo siento''
When matpat reaches his final video. I won’t be surprised if Mr beast cry’s

My worst nightmare is you leaving
I will miss this voice. I hape mattpat will come occasionally or at final conclusion theory of games
im really gonna miss matpat tbh.
I just gotta say we'll probably miss him alot man and like any of y'all remember that short about him talking about how marvel got that subscriber plate but the others didn't so why don't we try to get him there for a final troll
🚌 👶🩸
Gotta cherish all we have left, love your theories and always will. All 9 following videos will be monumental!
miss you mat, also if in an alternate timeline instead of going 9 more theories and dipping (no harm implied) i was thinking how bout you do a mix of videos to the point where it seems more and more natural not to have you in videos so the community wont be as shocked as i was then do the final 9
I love the old intro
I'm crying rn
Agree with me that Matt Pat with their childhood
Matpat you are my childhood
I think the player in the dreams is a nice one after all there are naughty ones so why not nice ones?
There’s no theorist out there that’s better than matpat
How do miss you bro
Can you do angel hare by the east patch?
Who won here is sad that matpat is leaving
Mat pat could just do what others do, post 1 video per month and take it easy, what comes to mind would it be film, game, food, or style, do it like a hobby and not stress about it if you miss one month one video, win-win to everyone
I am going to miss matpat so much
I swear I made a paragraph at the goodbye internet like mat you literally changed my life
Bro you still haven’t figured out the fnaf lore Music Man forever Music Man
There's Badbad From Garten Of Banban

I don’t know if banana was “the evil red man” cause there is syringeon and he stole the last bit of it, he’s evil too.
seeing the old intro actually broke me
It feels so bittersweet knowing we are 9 theories away from saying goodbye to Matpat and welcoming Tom. I hope Matpat knows he not only created so many childhoods but raised 18.7 million mini theorists from the ground up.
Why is one of the last matpat theories garten of ytshortsbrainrot
Thank you Matpat for being a huge part of our lives❤️
Can you do a theory about deep rock galactic
It’s so great to see the opening credits again but it’s sad to know that it’s not gonna be the same
Comment Just a comment no one asked me to comment but just comment Only comment I didn't ask No one ask me to do this But i commented So @UTTP no one asked me to comment this Also I will miss matpat...  I will miss you matpat...  You will be loved...  And passed through generations...
The old intro hits soo hard❤❤
TOM U BETTER DO FNAF THEROIES
Will it be the same without matpat?

We will all miss you so much mat, you’re more than just a YouTube channel to us. You bring happiness and joy to us and deeply hold a part of our soul. Thank you so much ❤for

How can we be zolpuis if we can see ourselves
So every other channel will be hosted differently but mat will still be involved
It's nice to see your last few episodes very melancholy 🥲👍
No one can replace the MatPat PNG
It’s about family😊 that’s cute
I hope we get an extended version for the outro of the last theory
Man its so sad to see matpat leave😢
I'm gonna miss you so much matpat❤
I think I can speak for everyone, we will miss matpat.
Bye Bye MatPat and hello Tom

Tom…if your reading this…please…please carry the legend…
Farewell you handsome mad man. We will miss you.
Plz consider continuing with the fnaf theories but everything else Tom can do. (Although I completely agree with your decision if you wish not to continue). Like if you agree so Matpat can see this.
I MISSED. THE CLASSIIC INTRO
Toddle loos to Matpat  you will be missed
I'll miss this           Thank you MatPat
8 more theories to go fellas 😢
I’ve been a theorist since I was 5 wow just wow
This intro will make me snap
God have i missed that intro
We are going to miss you
Your the main reason why youtube has lots of theories about different things but hey that's just a theory stay theorizen
I never heard of this game?
1st episode down- THE INTRO IS BACK
OLD INTRO OLD INTRO OLD INTRO
I MISSED THE INTRO OMGGGG
I've ben watching your videos for 9 years (I'm 22 now) and even to this day I love has passionate you are and the amount of heart and soul you put into your videos. Its sad to see you go but all we can do is hope for the best for you, gonna miss you MatPat!
Nah man 😭
I hope he come back mat pat plss come back😢😢
Wait this is the first of the last episodes but style theory has already released a new episode before this episode
I haven't watched in a while, but i had to come back for a few more before Mat retires. This man had a chokehold on parts of my childhood.
I'm gonna miss ya' dude... I've been watching for 5 years now...
We are all gonna miss you matpat😞
I will miss you so much
Why is Matpat quitting?
Can we have the older intro pls
The last  theory  MUST be a FNAF video
1:49 im about to cuh
When that final theory comes I'm praying they print the OG Game Theory Screen on a huge banner to hang at the back of the couch for that video
YEESSSSSSSAAAAAA INTRO BACK
That classic intro... can make any man cry...
Nothing like the classic intro, love it <3
Started watching this channel when I was 9 years old, I’m 18 now…
he started ruining our childhood when I was born
We will miss you matpat 😢
Matpat pls don't leave 😢😢😢😢
At least the old intro is back i don't think am ready for march 9
matpat should show up randomly in the middle of theorys when he leaves the theorists, just appears in the video at a random point sometimes
Hi matpat
If I don't see MatPat say "LOOOOORE" while being overdramatic with the expression he makes while saying it, I'm never coming back to this channel
9
that classic intro really mad me tear up
i hope the intro gets older as the theories come out
this comment is 41 seconds into the video. seeing the old intro brought me so much nostalgia lol. Thanks MatPat :D
I am crying
It would be awesome if the last theory is a sum up of fnaf.   We will miss you man you made our childhoods
but that's not the true classic intro
respect our grandfather of theory
Im Still sad matpat retired
That intro was bitter sweet, I've missed it yet sad to know there's only 9 episodes left.
going to miss you
i know everyones saying it but i really am gonna miss matpat
I miss the nostalgic Intros
Gonna miss you matpat you were one of the best youtubers ever.
As much as I love matpat, I’m also excited to see Tom take over, hoping he will add something new to the Channel.
Choo choo Charles is like thomas but horor. Its like a cartoon apeared in a video game.  In Garten Of BanBan there is a room where we are jumpscared by a black cow, everyone says that the cows name is Milky Moo,Sir Dadadoos wife,and she never apeared since... Strange is it...  We Will Miss you Matpat,Thank you for all these years  If you are reading this Matpat I think you should cover on Milky Moo,and how is she related to him
thank you mat
I wish it was just a theory A game theory!!
I think i just ascended hearing the old game theory intro. Man ill miss you matpat, thank you for making my childhood bearable
Can we do a dark souls lore pls it would make my weeks better because I'm stuck trying to find out the lore about dark souls
The internet will never be the same ;-;
Why is everyone not enjoying video and only talking about "how sad is this" i know that it is hard but please jnust enjoy
Man, Imm gonne enjoy these last theories, and Im gonne miss the OGS of YouTube and GameTheories helped me through many things, But thats just a Theory
I wish you wouldve stayed longer but you chosen your own path of life
We will miss you matmat
why one of the final theories is about fricking garten on banban!?
0:21 YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH WOOOOOOOO
0:45 like don't stress your eyes on the background
Matpat we will all miss you
I'm going to cherish every second of these last 9 theories
It crazy to see we all prever to the  same way to saying goodbye to something. i once used the majoras mask ending too. Its very emotional
what did any of this mean...
I resubed because of the intro
Can you do a BFDI theory please.
Im gonna miss matpat ;-;
NAHHHH NOT THE COUNTDOWN TO REMIND US
Don't leave matpat u were my inspiration

We will miss you matpat
Im goin to miss you matpat you were my child hood i will always wake up in the morning a d check if you have posted anything new one of my favorit game theory was the fnaf series ill miss you
You mean "knightmare"?
It might be cope, but I think matpat will hide a secret 10th theory. That you can find, with clues from the other 9 theories.
I have tears…..in my eyes..
Lethal Company theory when?
I guess that Fast and Furious reference was on point.
Pls do lethal company loreee
man pls dont go i beg you please man pleading you man please
atleast finnish it/me off with some fnaf theory for the last video alright.
Who wants to kidnap MatPat and his team and put in the basement and force him to make more theories?   Note: Just a joke I know that MatPat is tired and wants to rest.
HECK YES THE OG INTRO‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
If the last theory isn’t a fnaf theory I ain’t letting you quit.
THE OLD INTRO HYPED ME UP 😅
Matpat thank you for these years  We are gonna miss you after you make you're last videos 🙏
Oh my god, the intros are back!
If Tom doesn't use a PNG when he takes over, I'm not watching it!
8 remain sadly,we will miss you
I will miss you matpat😢
Well, so long Mat, its been a really amazing years, I'll miss you, goodbye

It's Just A Theory A Game Theory (Thanks MATPAT)
I missed the old intro so much
I haven’t watched this channel since 2020 and hearing ur leaving this channel is  a random emotional gut punch I wasn’t ready for. Thank you for everything MatPat for everything❤️
Game theory will Never be same again
It's almost like I can still hear him:(
Matpat is really tugging at the emotions. First he announces his retirement from presenting and now the classic intro is back, I’m not crying you are.   Thank you matpat for being such a huge part of my life since my teenage years (now 21)
Man, I really gonna miss matpat. I hope he knows how to replaces him to still have this Channel alive.

Try the first intro
Seeing the classic intro almost made me cry!😂 so many great memories and moments with you, I’m going to miss you MatPat
I'm currently working on a game and wanted MatPat to a theory on it. It's really sad to see him go 😢
Matpat can theorize about a game without finishing it now? Guys he's become too powerful
broo
Can we get an ark survival evolved video?
YouTube wouldn't be the same without the king of theorys
Down to 8 more theories now…
Im gonna miss u soo much matpat😞😞😢😢
The bots in these comments are crazy. They're creating chains where they rely to each other and leaving like 200+ messages and its ridiculous.
Matpat I grew up watching you your my childhood
Make a theory on omori please
Me too am still crying❤
You should do subnatica
Matpat i alr miss u :(
😭
Please don’t leave matpat, it feels like your the tape keeping that one draw from breaking off, as we all will have to end up leaving, it dosent hurt less, love you matpat goodbye mat. P. Theory ❤❤  That’s just a theory, a game theory!
The count down at the start of the video is something I’d never thought I’d see. The OG intro as well. I’m so hyped for the rest of these theories
first of the 10 episodes... this is sad
If were gonna go out, then we need that 2011 Windows movie maker intro.
🅘🅜  🅢🅞  🅢🅐🅓  🅣🅞  🅢🅔🅔  🅜🅐🅣  🅟🅐🅣  🅖🅞😢
man i'll miss you matpat! you really left a big mark on my childhood :)
Please do one final fnaf theory
Please let the last video be a FNaF video
Please do a theory on battle for dream island
Normally I'm no fan on Garden of Banban but since this is one of MatPats last theories, I gotta watch it.
The fact that's sad is that Mat Pat won't be the one theorizing about poppy playtime chapter 3
Il miss you... alot matpat
He said ruining your childhood since 2011 but he’s been making my childhood since 2011 you will be missed ☹️☹️☹️😕

The original intro dude😢 bring back the memories
Bro did not waste one of the few videos he'll be in on GARTEN OF BANBAN.
We are going to miss you mat 😢
Bro chose ban ban over any game 😭 imma miss you mat
The intro hit me with a big wave of nostalgia, gutted once MatPat leaves
I'm gonna miss you so much, Tom is cool though!
Everyone's gonna miss you Matpat. Also,i just realised,Zulphius is the only one that doesn't have moon eyes on their artwork on the wall,every other mascot has moon eyes,but Zulphius is looking straight,he doesn't have moon eyes he has circle eyes
What if the Stinger is a child that we are searching for?
THANK YOU FOR THE INTRO I AM SOBBING
Y’all don’t understand how happy I was to hear that original intro. 🥲
we are going to miss you matpat
No one gonna mention how clean that outro was
only 9 theroies remain

YEEEEESSSS THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I never liked mat for his theories not that their bad or anything but i like how he sounds very chill to listen to when u need a background vid
I waited for Matpat to create a theory about metro games, sadly Matpat will never make it even if has so much lore,
Hey Matt Pat, are you going to give the other channels away to?
I love that classic intro so much! It’s pure gold
Gonna be a crazy ride with only 9 theories..
PLS DONT GO I CANT LIVE WITHOUT YOUR THEORYS PLS I DONT WANT YOU TO GO I BEEN A FAN SINCE 2013 AND THEN I WATCHED YOU DAILY SO PLS FROM my Heart don’t go pls
ngd
I love this I love the old intro it’s just too cool
That old intro brings back so much, the nostalgia! I'm really gonna miss matpat so much, it was so great being here through his journey on youtube.
Its been so long since ive seen that intro, I forgot how much I loved it, im gonna miss him so much
That intro was sick 🔥
We're gonna miss you mat as the face of the theorists for 13 years its gonna hurt to say goodbye.
I thought it was someone else for a second 😭
My life is changing. Slowly but surely
--Week 2 🥲--
Pov: coming back here to see if new episode has come out and 8 episode left...
Isnt it kinda weird how everyone is commenting about how theyre gonna miss matpat instead of the actual video.
0:22 please tell me I’m not the only one who got a Crazy amount of nostalgia from that intro.
When I heard he will quit I cried you helped me I love you so much mat you helped I can't thank you enough
1/9😭😭
Im going to miss you so much mat... you will always be remembered in youtube algorithm
BROOO I MISSED THAT INTRO SO MUCHH...im gonna cry with the nostalgia and the fact that hes retiring😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Pls do attack on Titan lore plssssss and we all will miss you hope you still post like maybe every month 😢😢
only matpat would do one of his last theories on garten of ban ban
anyone willing to bet that his last ever theory will be a FNaF theory?
Matpat could you do us a favor and delete every "UTTP" comment and replies this is supposed to be a happy video and we would love to cherish your last 9 videos but the "UTTP" bots is making us laugh off of their clown faces instead
Hey I got the katana zero reference. Great game
Pls make a channel for behind the scenes or so that you operate
Man I hope the new owner of the channel will not be posting the something weird We're gonna miss you matpat😭
matpat: "if i have 9 theories left before i hand it over to 🙄.....tom ..."
please do not go it will never be the same without you take like a year break however long you want just don’t go
I know it’s going to be hard to lose matpat. I think so too. But I don’t want to spend these last theories with “oh, I’m going to miss matpat” or “we’re going to miss you”. I want to treat them like they’re the usual every week theories matpat has given us. Cherish the last moment with him as if they aren’t. Don’t mourn before it happens.
I would love it if he did outer wilds. Please?
I just realized that matpat most likely wont cover poppy playtime chapter 3 :(
Matpqt we will all miss you thx for making childhood easier
It's the beginning of the end for MatPat, and I'm bittersweet. We'll miss you!
Im confused we cant be zulpious becuase we see zulphios in the dreams spectating from far away
0:23 let’s goooooooooo. The sounds of my youth
Please keep the intro!!!
CLASSIC INTRO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We will miss you
Who would win MARVEL or DC 🎉
:0
Thank you for everything matpat.
CLASSIC INTRO LET'S GOOOOOOO
I'm going to miss this whole craziness without you
Goodbye matpat, you always helped us from day one, we all love you
Its sad but happy ❤
Goodbye matpat you were my childhood
IT'S BACK THE INTRO OF MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK YESSSSSSSSS
Hey matpat you do co-hosting the YouTube channel
Make a DHMIS Vid about the new season
I'm gonna miss you man.
After the final theory he’s going to look at his photos and see all the old pngs lol
I really hope he pulls a cory (if you know you know)
The intro made me cry
seeing the classic intro in one of his nine final theories brings back so much nostalgia
I’m gonna miss you you were my childhood
I hope that MatPat's last game theory is going to be about the best game in history Lethal Company
I’m literally crying 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The classic intro is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please make a amazing song about game theroy Bin through before you hand it over
thanks for these 9 episodes that we still have with you
MAKE TOM KEEP THAT INTRO. DO NOT LET HIM CHANGE IT. KEEP IT OG
Still don't know all the fnaf lore
We will miss matpat
Sobbing
Hits different
The countdown begins the clock winds down but the memorys live on Thank you mat pat  For making my childhood worth remembering and making me a little bit smarter with every single one of your uploads
I totally appreciate your deep analysis of the game series. The dream sequences theories are also interesting. While the over-the-top randomness and the absurdity can be offputting, you've shown that there may be a deeper narrative underneath it all.
0:34 Oh my god… Monika is Sans!
Im going to miss you i will always look back at older videos and cry :(
The way you can say all of this with a straight face and completely serious is impressive honestly xb. I’m nodding along until I realize how insane it all sounds and I can’t help but laugh xb
Plz don't go matpat😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😩😪😭😭😭😭😓
Hey Mattpat I don’t know if you remember me but I was on your goodbye Internet video. Thank we will all miss you matpat we love you matpat goodbye, Matt, pat we will all miss you in many different ways but if you’re going to quit, I’ll quit to ❤😢😭
Miss ya so much dawg.            Btw i see so much of UTTP. Idk what it mean, but it spam about "UTTP its more better than matpat" and "matpat never return" like tf.  I see the comment on @ZeroNeedCofee   I dont understand what uttp mean cuz, littereally dont understand 💀
I will miss matpat he made most of my childhood
9 theories remain....
Thanks Matpat we will miss you forever hope to see you even after moving on🫶
He is leaving just like Scott
ım gonna miss this channel
Wooo!! Classically revamped intro, so cool!! :D
We love you Mat❤
🗿 matpat nah goated mat also what is the pat for in matpat is it for Patrick
im gonna kms the day he quits bro this guy made my life
This might be a bit controversial (cus all the matpat retiring and im not talking about it) but this looks like an argument in favor of car-based infrastructure and against public transport (9:15)
Thank you matpat
The old intro, its been so long 🥹
We are going to miss you matpat ❤️
Matpat if poppy playtime 3 comes out can u do that one episode plss bc ur gonna retire so can u just do that one episode plsss we would really appreciate it🙏🙏🙏
Im gonna miss matpat ruining our childhoode and creating it but now im excited for the new theorist
That classic intro hits so hard. <3
Let's just hope the moon is real in Tom's videos
Myself. I don't like Garden of Banban's lore and the whole game. But this is from MatPat. And i like Matpat so i gonna watch it
Thank you for all the great memories Matt. Also was super excited to see the old intro back and am looking forward to the future of the channels and to see whatever you do in the future. Thank you for the happy memories.
I want the REAL classic into...
I bet the last theory has to be fnaf
Matpat if your reading this I just wanna ask will you still occasionally be on film theory or atleast food theory?
17k
FRICK YEAH BABY!
Jxnxjxjz the classic intro😭😭
noooooooooooooooooooooooo yy are you leaving noooooooooooooo;(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
I missed that intro so much
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢salute to you
Thank you so much for everything❤
ignore anything to do with UTTP they aren't worth it
I'd like to imagine the brothers eagerly waiting for matpats video and are like "oh so that's what we meant by the beach"
Imagine if matpat was part of the shorts wars or something else
you are my only favourite tourist
Respect man
matpad i watched some theorys and espicialy the ddlc ones but goodbye og youtuber
Why does this game even really exist? It's just kinda bad. And why is there a theory on it? Either way we'll miss you GrandPatty
I know mat pat is legit about his decision and it’s completely reasonable however I wish he could stay with us
Thank you matpat for all these vids!
I very much hope every new owner of the channel will have their own cutout photo from 2013 to assist them in their videos, its such a small but consistent detail.
Ok im really sad too about him leaving but like can we actually talk about the thoery that he worked on?
Entertaining your childhood since 2011
mat can you at least come back at randomly for a single episode every now and then
I Love This Thank You For Doing The Classic Intro
gotta watch these 10 last theories fully to make em worth
BRO The intro went SO HARD, love it<3
Please matpat make a theory about lethal company
8 videos left
Matpat thank you 😢
This game gets so little respect that no one talks about it in the comments. Deserves it tho 😂
MY BROTHER OF CRISIS WHY GARTEN OF BANBAN YOU HAVE 9 MORE THEORIES  Please do an ULTRAKILL theorie
Please dont leave. Why is everybody leaving?
Thanks for. Making our chilhood
Matpat Nooo don’t leave your channel you were the best Game theorist I’ve ever laid my eyes on😢
The intro had a great bop and we will miss you matpat
Hopefully after a whole you’ll come back we will miss you I only been watching you for 5 months 🥺
Can’t believe this is one of his last videos😞
Personally, I think that because Banbaleena is Mrs. Mason, Stinger Flynn being there when she was still a human, is meaning that Stonger Flynn was the first experiment that worked.
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!
Thanks matpat for giving me hope about fnaf lore, will miss you for all your horror film theories
You have my respect bro
Mat said Effin...omg we really are in the endgame
But I wanna see mat pat finish poppy playtime lore
Do Geometrydash2015!
next needs to be shipwrecked 64
My heart hurts so much for you leaving, but i know you will be happier. Thank you for giving me an escape from abuse.
I still remember the first video you used that inchro(spelled that wong) we are all gonna miss you 😢
honestly i will miss matpat but i am excited to see tom take the lead
I get hella nostalgia from that it gives me the chills
one last request  I want to make is do a theory on fear and hunger game
Goodbye
I hope this editing style will stay also i will miss you matpat
Yep...we will miss you❤
The old intro makes me so happy
9 theories left? Then 9 games to play
I cried watching this video
Man he was my childhood this will be sad when he leaves
I will miss the theories that was created by Matpat
Look guys I know this is sad that matpat is leaving because he is a YouTube legend but I don’t think he wants every comment to say “who’s here after the goodbye internet video” or “I’m gonna miss matpat” and yes that is true…..he is and will always be part of our childhoods but don’t make all of the comments on how your gonna miss home or how he shouldn’t leave say something like “great video matpat….it was well edited and fun to watch”
I WAS FR DANCING WITH THE INTRO! LOVE YOU MATPAT! WILL ALWAYS WATCH UR VIDEOS EVEN THE OLDIES!❤❤❤  Edit: Tom, I welcome you but if you do not include dad jokes, I will type the ones you miss.
This mans oath that's written on his channel is literally 'ruining your childhood since 2011' but instead hes been making it. You'll be missed matpat
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY BROUGHT BACK THE CLASSIC INTRO
The count down starts…
i better see that last petscop theory before you quit
Imagine matpats last video is about garten of banban 💀

that old intro man, it made happy and sad x)
A legend must go some day,some day…
u aint ruining are  childhood from 2011 u making our childhood from 2011
Matpat is one of the reasons i have a huge appreciation for science. It’s gonna be sad to see him take leave. But he 100% deserves it. I started watching game theory when I was a kid. Im a grown adult now. Thanks for sticking around Matpat, thank you for introducing me to so many different games, and thank you for all of the fun memories of binging theories with my friends. 💚
It’s not gonna be the same without Matpat
we'll miss you a lot
i will mis you my guy matpat :)
Please come back to YouTube that's going to be sad
oh man.
I have loved watching matpat for the last few years and I’m really going to miss watching him
I hope he makes couple comebacks here and there
Please don't leave I want to hear you please
Matpat, may we please have one last DDLC theory?
Imagine matpat has been making his own arg and it will presented in the last theory
jellyfish
I think after matpat leaves the loyal theorists of matpat might leave too
Lets go! Classic Intro! Thank you matpat for 13 years of memories!
Please do a theory on little nightmares
I can only cry with tears of joy to be living through these last 9 theory's
Oh captain,my captain you will be missed❤️
Don’t be sad it’s over     Be happy it started
i need fornite theory NOOW
dude seeing the old intro just makes me even more happier i’m glad you’ve moved on from GT you truly do deserve this break.
The return of the intro made me cry
The intro hit so hard dude
It might be an older intro but it ain't the classic!!
We need a one last Fortnite theory 🙏🙏😭😭
Stop making me cry
We don't want you to leave us, MatPat😢
It would be cool if the first game theory introduction was used for matpats last theroy😢
You should do a theory on the dealer killing god in buckshot roulette
I AM LOVING THE FIRST VIDEO OF THE COUNT DOWN
May pat plz stay with us plz we don’t care how about when you post we just want you here plz stay PZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
I will forever remember this as Matpats channel.. I don't hate a new face to the channel. But, matpat man.. I'm going to cry my heart out when he's gone.
Make sure you say That’s just a game theory on your last vid with you In
The classic intro made my eyes tear up
That intro was so nostalgic we needed this.
He planned the theorizing music vid for this it was his goodbye
Goodbye matpat
And so it begins... thanks matpat
your last theory gotta be a fnaf one
This year is the worst year ever
yes the intro is so old and nostalgic
Just why?
He said he's not doing any more Theories, not streams though... Right..?
hopefully he occasionally does host a video or two on special occasions
It just hurts me that one of MatPat's last videos is a Garten of BanBan video.
How did i miss the fact that nabnab looked like the gaping dragon on dark souls 😂😂😂😅
🫡
We need EVEN MORE classic intros ❤
We all love you matpat in so sad that you’ll quoting but it’s your decision. I hope you have a great life away from the channel I loved your content too!! I hope you’ll do well
i may dislike garten of banban is the last 9 so i have too
MatPat leaving is sad BUT Tom is amazing and he will do amazing there’s plenty of hope
u were such a big part of my childhood im gonna miss u so much
The original intro ❤
Type "i just gotta take" to respect matpat
This hits different when knowing he’s gonna retire soon
Thank you Matpat for being my childhood and you always will be the best in my heart, wish you a great future.
Honest to god just here ‘cause I’m a simp for sentimentality - we’ll miss you, Matt. You made all of our lives better.
PLEASE do a game theory on Rabbids Go Home!!
I missed the intron
Don't leave us, MatPat!!!
The ambitious yet so pain in his voice this video, like He happy to make a video yet he remembers that these are his last few moments... 🥲
What happened to Chapter 5?!
and when the world needed him most. he came .
Truly is the darkest timeline if it’s garden of banban
Day 1 asking matpat to make a theory on the last Monday
Gonna miss you matpat ❤
YES! THE CLASSIC GAME THEORY THEME! FRICK YEAH!!!
I CAN'T STAND THAT HE IS LEAVING😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
HE BROUGHT BACK THE CLASSIC INTRO
I love the fact he brought back the classic intro, though it isn’t really the original one (from what I remember) I’m still glad he made my childhood great, il miss him so much once he’s gone
Im gonna miss this dude.  You made my childhood, buddy.❤
Dont leave your my childhood    Im crying while typeing dont leave
i honestly think the child uthman and mason were trying to have is zolphius.
8 remain and we will all miss you on the day you go matpat thank you for making so many peoples childhoods
That intro is nostalgic even after the changes, mat is truly the last loss of out childhoods
Petition for matpat to forever keep All of the channels original intros (reply or like the comment)  We’ll miss you matpat, thanks for everything. You inspired me, my YouTube channel. You are still my childhood, I’m in childhood, thank you so much, thanks.
ALL THE COLORS ARE LIT NOW
The intro made me cry again😭
8 more....
We love you matpat we're going to miss you!
5:55 THE SUBTITLES SAY THE SKYRIM THING THEY SAID THE THING
this channel made me smarter thanks Mathew Pathew
Plss do a rick and morty theory
Plss do arick and morty theory
I just want to remind everyone in the comment section. If you see a troll comment or spam please report it and dont even give it attention.
THIS IS CHILDHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
How the title says ur worst nightmare fits perfectly of how matpat is leaving 😢
ive always love seeing this content from u guys, my most favourite one from the arg seriees is the catashtrope crow, you guys probably forgotten about it but im still waiting for the day of the next catastrophe crow theory, rest well matapt
I'm going to miss you
We will miss you you are the goat of you tube you will be missed your channel is my childhood I will miss you matpat
Mat u said the CLASSIC intro, that was the 2.0 intro
This is Just A Theory A GAME THEORY
We're going to miss the game theory but hello new guy game theory and I'm going to miss Scott I hope that I can see you on the internet one day please find a way to bring back the times time's please pin this comments😢🎉❤
I thought you quit?
Obligatory thank you for everything MatPat. Anyway, I really do find Garten of Banban interesting, in a morbid sort of way. I'm glad we got one last theory about it from Mat, and hopefully Tom will continue to make some about it, unless the series just gets worse.
Hey, it's been a great walk with you.... I hope you will keep the classic... *It's just a Theory, A GAME THEORY*
THE INTRO?? YESSS LETS GOO 😢😢😭😭😭
We will never forget you Matpat
No you can't leave your my favorite please😢
Thanks bro
He made my childhood
Although this is ought to be a fun theory video i just cant take it man 9 theories and the recent cook lynja passing away... Im gonna miss both of these guys they were part of my childhoods
Me toooo
Gonna miss you so much matpat 😢😞
What a legend 😢
Is this your last theory :(
Please don’t leave
i know nothing of Garten of Banban and am completely taken aback from the first 2 minutes of this video
The final 9 eh? A great run it’s been.
In a way I hate to say it, but it really is a childhood dream fulfilled seeing all 4 of the channel colors in the intro. Even before film theory came out I used to try to predict what the other channels would be. That's the kind of deep cutting fulfillment I don't think I'll ever get anywhere else.
i miss the original intro man
see you on the flip side matt pat 😭😭😭😭
The Theme is gonna be So Nostalgic
No no no no FOUP
The day you retire is 3 days after my birthday 🥲
MatPat..   Thank You For being with us for 13 years and with those amazing fnaf popular videos.. also you old nostalgian videos hits hard too much i will miss you MatPat This Channel Without you can't be more fun..😢   Thank you sir
We got classic intro back before gta vi
7:14 this feels like a fever dream 💀
So, are you making any new film theories?
One of ur 9 theories better be a poppy playtime 3 one 😔🙏🙏
Hypeeeeee og introoooo
I’m going to miss this
Of all the things he chose to make theories before his retirement... why this? GoB is such a brainrot with too much attention than what it deserved
Game theory:             The last theory...
no way he’s back
I thought u retired?
pls dont go
AWW MANNN, I LOVE THE CLASSIC INTRO, ITSS just better
thank you matpat for everything I will miss you
We'll miss you MatPat
what about the main character sharing the same name as that teacher mentioned in the kids' notes? the name, for those that don't know, is mrs. mason, so... our player being the teacher is really throwing me off when it comes to the lore, because the characters act like we're new here, despite the fact that toadster for whatever reason knows who we are
Its not the same without you matpat we are all realy gonna miss you
That intro literally made me cry
I DONT EVEN WANT Anything to do with you because your abandoning YouTube and the community
THE INTRO IS BACK WITH THE STYLE THEORY CORNER
I'll miss you mat pat
Bro we gon miss youuu ❤❤❤
bus=no freedom
yay!classic intro for the win!
I’m going to miss this intro
I going to miss you
I've listened to Matpat at work every day for years. Always calms my mind when I'm stressed out. Gonna have to make a list of all his videos to play on repeat for the next 40 years
Thank you
THE INTRO IS BACK !!!
And if you do hate  your videos suck and you’re 8 years old and have 1 like and the uttp sucks and stop spamming
It wouldn’t be game theory without a bit of banban
Thank you, Matpat, for making my childhood so much fun. We are all going to miss you   We wish you all the best in your future, and thanks for everything ❤
Matpat nabnab din't lose it's nabnelena
love you dadpat<3 wishing you the best in what’s to come, thank you for everything you’ve done for us<333
I'm going to miss you Matpat
Thanks for everything matpat, you’ve been my childhood hero and we’re all gonna miss you! You’ve even inspired me to make content myself
NEW VIDEO (I’m going to miss you to much)
First I’m gonna miss matpat second stop with the hate comments if you do that you’re so fake it’s his last 9 videos be nice for his last videos
Matpat I’ll miss u……
NUH UH MATPAT IM KIDNAPPING YOU YOU NOT LEAVENG YET
thanks mat pat you were our childhood
I can’t believe it’s only been 13 years… DONT GIVE UP MAT
He’s not gone. But still. You will be in my heart until death.
Thanks matpat for all you did for us.
I am really sad that he is going to be gone
Classic intro nostalgia
MatPat=G.O.A.T.
The fact he's doing this several videos left makes this more sad
The intro goes SO hard
Thank you matpat for all the memories
I hope that matpat does theories in each style he's done over the past 13 years of this. Like, one classic style (based on the days of the old CD logo), one middle style (With the original mario intro that had the janky looking mario sprite), and one modern style
I think it would’ve been sick if matpat did a vid on school games like cool math games but it will sadly never happen :,(
i have a theory that they are leaking choo choo charles because the next dream was a bus and whoever know choo choo charles endong will know
CLASSIC INTRO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Old intro... oh all the memories...  Salute
Oh my god that og intro is a nostalgia blast from the past
We need to get MatPat to 20M before he qut!
Hey Mat, if you don't mind, can you do a theory where you a theory of either; Does Korekiyo Shinguji ACTUALLY have tulpa, is Shuichi Saihara actually depressed, is Kokichi Ouma actually a supreme leader, and is the situation between Izuru and Hajime actually possible?  The first three characters are from Danganronpa V3, and the last two are from danganronpa v2 (I think)  And if you want, can you also do what caused Toko Fukawa split personality disorder?  This are all things I've always wanted you to try, but I always felt maybe it wasn't possible, so now that your no longer going to be the host in the future, I thought maybe I should finally let out my thoughts, but I doubt this'll reach ya 😅
It somehow reminds me of the backrooms
Thank the lord Jesus 😢🎉🎉🎉❤ 0:21
You were my childhood Matpat, it's so sad to see you go.
Thanks for making my childhood
You’re a legend Matt, thank you… For everything brother
Im gonna miss matpat soo much you are my childhood and will be for the next 9 theories
DO A PLANTS VS ZOMBIES THEORY PLS
I will miss your voice :(
WOAH
Originally I used to watch as a eight year-old as a comfort show
I actually yelled “yes” when you said to use the classic intro. Nearly tears of joy. Thank you for everything.

Matpat you said yore stoping posting
Will you still be acting Matthew, eg Fnaf The Musical? And you could keep gaming, as you missed just playing video games with Steph for fun and not theorizing, so my request is to just be yourself. 🙂
matpat ill miss you you were my child hood hero and as a final wish can you do a roblox piggy theory video it would be nice if you do thank you for everything
I will cherish this moment when we still have it
o7
Goodbye man 😭 we will miss you dearly. Even when you’re gone we will still watch your old theories.
Matpat is one of the reasons i am still alive and tis sad to see him go now i hope everything is goos with your family....
OG intro is back finally

We'll miss you matpat, you've always been the genius. (and mike keenan as well 😉)
Abanban all hope
Thank you for everything mat we’ll miss you grandpa pat but make sure to visit every once in awhile❤😭😭
welcome to the hall of youtube fame and the best intro goes to the game theorists
Matpat you are the best youtuber ever
I never really watched matpat that much, but its really sad thay matpat and all these others quit.  uttp dont ruin this for me
Although matpat may have 9 theories left and retire,we are still remembering him and his legacy
When you had your channel can you please tell the guy that will get it to not delete any of your old theories
I really missed the traditional Game Theory intros💕
It’s not going to be the same without him
Man, it’s been forever since I’ve seen you guys definitely got here and on an interesting note though looking at your history, it’s in a lot
THAT CLASSIC INTRO IS NAHHHH THAT WAS AMAZING i was never gonna watch this video but its one of your last theorys i had too
Man…
Dude I'm not crying rn...😭😭😭
i'm Gonna Miss Matpat!! But i'm Happy He'll Pop in Some times, i Am So Freaking Happy i Grew Up With Game Theory
Game theory you are my core memory of the og days of youtube you were been with a several years i'm going to really miss you i'm been watching your videos since i was 8 years old now i'm 13 this is from my heart is not a theory a remembering theory thank you comment by your og fan you had 9 theory i will notify you
Imagine if he made a theory that Pecharunt gave everyone the Pokémon equivalent to rabies
I can’t watch this but I’m going to anyway
All I heard was a whole bunch of nothing
;(
i no no wanna :’(
i will miss u i watched u when i was 5 i will miss u thank u for being part of my childhood u dont know how much u gave me joy when i was sad thank u........thank u
The intro hits different when you know it's one of the last times you'll hear matpat after it ends (I was going to say "last times you hear it" but I doubt they change it that much)
9 theories remain....
That face thing has a name????
o7
OMG YES, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS
I will be here at the end, for this man was here when I first beginning to understand the internet! Thank you Matpat for all of the theories you've made, for they've taught me to never stop asking questions about anything!
One theroy I wish u would do is Tower Defense Simulator…
the era of Game Theory called the "final 10"
"Welcome to game theory" never gets old
Goodbye matpat🥲thank you
Wished he would've just took a long break but i understand not everything can last forever
Please don't leave I'm crying now😢
Please upload the entire fnaf theories series as 1 humongous video 😊
im gonna miss you mat...
MAN HAVE I MISSED THE INTRO
Hi I'll miss you 😢😢😢😭😭😭
i missied this intro
Couldn't he just use a ai voice or something?
Goodbye Matpat we will miss you
ganna miss you
please
The first part of the intro hit me with tears
fnaf VSH TAPES!!
Matpat was the only YouTuber who never got old. Jacksepticeye, Dantdm and Stanleylongnose change over my childhood but Mat didn’t. Thank you.
I LOVE THE CLASSIC INTRO
I may not like banban at all, but knowing this is apart of the 9 remaining, even if I’m late, I’ll be here
This made my cry just at the start ❤ you don’t need to like to be a true fan btw
fact that he wasted one of his last theories on this game is sad
Don’t go may pat please😢
We're gonna miss you, matpat.
Let’s not focus on the future so soon…….ahem- but I do really like this theory. (That’s all I have to say-)
"Ruining out childhood since 2011"?? XD
AYE!! OG intro at least we get to reminisce on the past as we move forward. 9 left and let’s enjoy them ❤
Thank u bro, js thank u..
The old intro hit way to hard man
Goodbye Mat we all love you
The old intro was better
😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭i miss that intro 😢😢😢
im going to cry every episode bc matpat is my childhood i still watch him to this day
the intro almost made me cry lol
im so glad but so sad to see matpat go but atleast we got the OG Music Or Theme
thank you for every thing you've done, we will miss you
i dont care about these last 9 theories, what i care about is hearing your voice with these last 9 videos.
Did anyone just hop on the video just to check if Matpat was here
So bitter sweet it brings a tear to my eyes fr
I’ve been watching you for years and I am really sad for you to go. I feel like I speak for everyone when I say you will be missed so much😢. Where will I get my weekly dose of LORE!!! And I’ll miss the Morty song.
The future generations will never know about game theory or Matpat... That's gonna be sad
End of an era
Can you make a theory of hollow knight
I think nabnab is the main person kid becaus
still gonna spin back and watch his 5 night WHOLE vids
im gonna miss you so much bro like i literally love you (not in a weird or romantic way but like a you are my whole childhood way)
I cannot believe that this game has so much more lore and depth than we could have ever thought and I hope that the creators can continue getting THEIR story out as they want it.
IM GONNA CRY THE INTRO LETS GOOOOO
Ty for everything  i wish you well ty for ruining our childhood❤
YESS THE ICONIC INTRO (We’ll miss you tho) 😢😢😢😢😢
Matpat im gona miss you.. you are still my life :(
Mat Pat I am not ready for you to leave. I don't think anyone is and it hurts, but I understand why. We love you mat pat.
I’m having my phone on max notification volume for your last videos. 😢
on the last theory we better see the real og intro
the original intro brings tears to my eyes                                                          i'm crying
It's not just a theory ..... It's a Game Theory!!
idea 💡  Game theory: that’s just a theory a game theory, thanks for watching Film theory: that’s just a theory a film theory, keep watching Food theory: that’s just a theory a food theory, keep eating Style theory: that’s just a theory a style theory, dress nice
Honestly I didn't come for the theory, i came for matpat
Missed the classic intro so much 😢I hope we get to see that more
i lowk pray that his last theory is a fnaf theory theres just no way its not
YESSS THE INTRO IS BACK
that old intro almost has me tearing up! we'll miss u matpat!!
OG intro was lit
matpat since you have only 9 theory’s left can you do a baby in a yellow? please
Mat we are gonna hunt you down if you’re last theory isn’t FNAF
Can you please reconsider… maybe once a month?? It might just be twelve Matpat videos a year but even one is better then none.
Hearing that intro was like the undertaker entrance from wwe always got me hype
I’m gonna miss you matpat plz return After some point after you retire
Goodbye matpat imma miss u overthinking stuff
listening to the intro im suddenly brought back to 2020, it just fills me with so much nostalgia and squeezes my heart a little
we should all comment o7 on his last theory
I do fallout as one of your last theories I love fallout please do
Man the old intro hits different. It started the beginning and now it's ending the end of his channel. I'm gonna miss matpat. The channel won't be the same without him.
Love you dude.
who going to be the next matpat i was too emotional to watch the full video ( nevermind it tom )
Thank you matpat for existing and being for of millions of childhoods, we will be here watching you theories
-9 THEROYS REMAIN- man I'm gonna watch all his videos over again and cry.
Gods I didn't realize how much I missed the classic intro. It just sent such chills down my spine...
the last theory better be the most world changing thing ever
0:39  why ur not ruinig childhoods ur the king why do u say thath
once a legend always a legend😞 after all its only a theory
cant matpat stay with us for just 2 more years please i will miss you
I'm so glad the intro was there I didn’t relize how much I miss that 🎉
8 more theories
you know he put a ton of thought into it when it all starts making sense
Thank you for everything Matpat the whole world will never be the same without you
The thumbnail says “aBANdon”… that’s *gotta* be on purpose XD
Yes the classic intro woo!
Nabnab wasn’t captured. That was nabnaleena you can tell because it’s her bow.
Matpat we love you! Dont go!
Hey no hate but you said NabNab falls under the mind control in this theory at 7:49 but that’s not NabNab in the mind controlled scene that’s his Female Counterpart (I can’t remember her name) you can tell by the glowing bow on one of her horns
For every next video you should slowly go down the intros till the last one
Dude you were me and my brothers Hero and me and him are crying so hard right now and my brother is trowing up we love you ❤❤❤❤🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁
😢😢😢😢😢😢
love that intro
These last 9 Theories is gonna break me....
MatPat should Sing Remember Me on his last theory video
Man I used to hate watching mats videos now I'm sad seeing matpat posting his first video of his final 10
I really hope the intro music sticks when the new host takes over
I am litrally crying.
Bro I got chills from the intro I’m gonna miss you matpat 😢
Fnaf GT vidoes wont be the same without mattpatt being thwarted by scott every game </3
I really hope that he just makes a few theories and not be gone forever
Bro was legit my childhood.... i feel so old.

We're all gonna miss you Matpat...

Guess we'll never get that second part of the kirby episode
I subconsciously teared when I saw the og intro even when he said
I'm wondering........ where did the wither come from? and how did it gets its name?
Thank you❤
Even though I’m. It subbed he’s made a part of my childhood and it sucks im getting older cause I’m only 12 and this year I’m turning 13 thank you, matpat 🥺
Yeaaaa he not quitting 😊
Im gonna miss matpat bro
May pat can you finish playing pizza tower before you go

Omg the classic intro i missed it so much, WE R GONNA MISS U SO MUCH MATPAT❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love how he brought back the classic intro the amount of nostalgia that just hit me.
May pat we are going to miss you so much I hope you know that❤️
my heart hurts. you will forever be in our hearts
Oh man oh boy.
the classic intro 😭
I'm crying rn
I kinda feel bad like I'm almost turning 18 and along with a new chapter in life my child hood is officially ending. I'm not sad tho
Its not jest a theory it a game theory😢
Happy retirement matpat i am going to miss you also I am 9 years old
I’m so glad that he brought back the old intro
series is still pretty wack tbh hopefully the zolphius reveal in game whenever it is is worth the wait
here it is the beginning of the end of matpat's era on the game theorists
Im gonna cry when you leave but hey make the theory longer please
Pls don’t go
I got waaay too happy about the old intro
Matpat Everyone knows that you are Retiring from the game theories but I have a idea you can make Another theory Channel and maybe you can Somehow get those theory videos on that Even though that another person makes the theory’s because you Said that in your goodbye Internat video and you showed there name in the video i really wanted to give it a name for you but i don’t know what to name it so you can choose the name
9 more videos till our childhood end
9 Theories Remains.......im gonna miss you Matpat Its Always Just Theory....
It is left to Scott making another game to drag Matpat out from retirement.
are you going to go work at youtube now that you have done what you have wanted to do forr the theorist channel like you said the the powerwash pals on markiplier's channel?
The original intro for one of the last videos got me crying 😭
Guys can we get this man to 20 million subscribers already so he can make his final video on the channel on march 9th be his 20 million subscribers congratulations video
I really cried after know matpat will     Retire after some months  It hurts
Funny, I always preferred matpat talking in game theory videos. Anyone else talking bored me.
Well, 9 theories left. Well, at least these 9 theories will be memories, the finale of MatPat. It’s like the final boss of the game, once you beat it, you don’t know what to do anymore. The game ends, and you stop playing and you forget it. Slowly, and surely. But it’s legacy lives on, just like MatPat. I wish MatPat and Stephanie the best, Goodbye MatPat and Steph…  - Love from VietNam 🇻🇳
Matpat please
The OG game theory intro looks amazing with the fashion part included in the new logo  Also, I have a project that I’m going to announce on my channel on the final week of Matt having a YouTuber, a little tribute to commemorate him
Thank you❤
I will miss you
U-HHH OH
Bro I honestly cried on his goodbye video and every other video on every other channel  WE WILL MISS YOU
Shorts wars please do it please
I'm so sad matpats leaving in a while 😢
old intro hit different
My first video after hearing the news.. and that first second my heart just sank...
matt....
If matt leaving means less of this content supporting a literal cash grab game then I'm all for it.
It's gonna be hard to see him go
thank you for being my childhood    also bringing back og intro
I have been watching matpat for so long and when the 9th theories is over it is going to be sad
Thank u mat pat for bringing back my childhood
5 years ago i was addicted to watching him so far to watching his oldest to most latest. We will miss him😢😢❤❤
Mat pat, no one will ever forget your name. YOU ARE THE GOD OF THEORY
:(
do deltarune chapter 2 pls
And a end of a legend
How many references of leaving YouTube but I am gonna miss you a lot no one else makes videos like you love you 🥹🥹🥹
NOOOOOO
Bringing back the classics  Thank you 🙏
it been 11 y since I missed that intro
I literally can’t watch this without crying knowing your gonna leave
Bye matpad we will miss you ❤ I hope you never forget us :,(
matpat please have the next 8 theory’s be fnaf
Thanks for the jurny
ONLY NINE MORE 😔
God the nostalgia
Why is matpat leaving:.(
If you have to Spam, your argument sucks and nobody likes you
MATPAT, you have 6 videos left until you leave and you use one of them on banban. (Facepalm)
I’m gonna miss you so much man
Probably not gonna watch anymore after he's gone . Something just tells me it's not gonna be the same
I already love it and I’m 0:40 in
Man, I'm or should I say we are gonna miss you so much Matpat! I hope the channel is still gonna be kicking after you retire!❤
Matpat why did you retire. You work something else like actor in movie
Well miss you matpat you have always been a brother to as all
9 theorys left 😐
Everyone will miss Matpat, but Tom seems like a smart person. Game theory will live on, and Maypats legacy will remain
it's Steve from Blues Clues all over again
For every new theory, we stray further from Matpat. I'm gonna miss you so much Mat
Thank you, Matpat
Before you leave can you make a 10 hour compilation of your videos
PLS SAY THAT ONLY GARTEN OF BANBAN IS GOING TO SCOTT❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I missed that old intro
Abandon?More like Abanbandon!
Matpat please at least do the fnaf theories until fnaf is over
I’m going to miss you so much mat
Lets go! Intro's back!
Ugh, that theme song...both epic shivers and tears.
😢
Miss you man.
Not only am I gonna miss tf outta MatPat, but finding out we’re the same age was WILD.  Dude either doesn’t have social anxiety or he has found some AMAZING ways to manage it while he goes about his life. Like, DANG I couldn’t do even 1/4 of what he did!
On March 9th fanf is left to rot
This is why Americans hate public transportation
Goodbye matpat. 🙂
EVRYONE REPLY TO THIS AND SIGN A POTITION FOR MATPAT NOT TO QUIT IF THIS GETS ENOUGH LIKES AND REPLIES THEY MIGHT SEE
The last theory should be a fnaf theory tbh
man I never thought I would see the old intro I'm no .... we're going to miss you matpat
😢 W upload 😭
I love your videos with my heart I need to say that you made everybody's childhood better ❤❤😢❤
we wont see mattpat finish some theorys
Me to dude but we will remember him
Literally crying while watching this video rn.
I'm sad at you're won't be able to make more videos.
I will miss this dude so much on March 9
Man hearing the old theme song made me almost cry because I will miss this so much
I cried for 4 days strait I even got a nose bleed
So when does matpat get out into the YouTube hall of fame
Thank you Matpat for being a part of everyone’s childhood here.We’ll always be here waiting for you to say ‘This is just a theory, a game theory’ again.  We wish you the best in your next chapter in life.
We all rocked out to that intro, right?? Glad to have that back for a little bit!
.
Well here comes the mat pat count down
Can we get the original intro
Are you going to do a lethal company theory?
bro the classic intro itself made me emotional though- missed opportunity not to use the very first one that looked like 10 FPS
I feel like matpats last 9 theories should be based on games/shows that made him popular today, I love you matpat
I hope Tom takes care of this channel well
Matpat please next year
It’s not the same without him
Sooo what I'm hearing is Tom is gonna become out next theorist 😲
Classic into! How have I missed you 😊
Map pet, please stay until March 10th. My birthday is on March 8th. And it will make me very unhappy if the day after my birthday where I get to go to legoland I don't get to see a theory with your voice in it
I swear they updated the classic intro or I’m just tripping and nine theories left one suffering Matt patt
Thank you mat pat for everything and I know YouTube can get hard just thanks when you quit have a awesome and wonderful life😊😊😊😊😊🐺👍
I’m so glad you brought back the old intro. THATS some nostalgia.
Don’t leave pls 😭
:(
Thank u mat pat
Jumbo Josh!!!
i dont even know anything about garten of banban but i dont care
garten of patmat
Ty for everything
I’m sad to see you go but you have made my day better and I’m going to miss you ❤❤❤
Why’s Matpat leaving though can someone explain
THE CLASSIC INTRO😍😍😍. I love it!! Gunna miss matpat so much😭😭
Please don’t leave matpat 🙏(day 1)
The nastolga from that intro hits
FINALLY!!!! THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!! for a short while
Says bringing back the classic intro, but... This wasn't it... Maybe because of him leaving, we know he may use it when we get closer to his leaving. Plus, I always missed every opening, why it came back now, but glad it was. They gotta keep the openings
matpat is (soon going to be was) one of the best content creators many grew up with his videos and honestly everyone is going to miss him (if you say you arent we know your lying) 13 years of making videos, honestly knew  he was going to quit soon. If you have made 13 years of videos  you kinda had it coming. not saying I wont miss mat though.  9 more theories, and thanks for bringing that classic intro back.
FINALLY!!!! THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!! for a short while
2/9 theories left
We are gonna miss you matpat..😭
FINALLY!!!! THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!! for a short while
The last theory is gon hit so hard
I know it's weird to hope this all just a lie or that he's just going on a long break and might come back. But I am going to miss these videos.
i’m gonna miss you matpat
We love you Matpat, and we’re all gonna miss you. Wish you the best with Steph and Ollie.
Ruining our childhood 2011

😢I'm gonna miss you l,please don't retire
Not my sobbing while watching this on the toilet
9 theories one matpat😢
Although we all are going to miss Matpat, I do hope Tom will be appreciated by the community rather than being constantly compared to Mat. There's no doubt that things will feel different, but I can only hope that future generations can find this channel and appreciate it the same way we all did the past decade.
Can you do a armored core 6 theroy plz? If not then i'm still thankfull for making my childhood
O7
goose bumps at the intro
I don’t know if Matpat did a theory on crk
Bro this guy is the greatest hope he a has great life

Matpat, you missed out on a golden opportunity to call yourself Grandpat in the Goodbye video, also I hope you’re happy when you do leave
Matty patty will be missed
Please pull a blue clues and come back some day
😢
Thank you Matpat for being the soundtrack of our childhood. Wishing you a fulfilling retirement; your impact will echo through generations
The classic intro hit me like a semi truck, I wasn’t ready for my heartstrings to be pulled like that

if I made art for MatPat, is there a way I could send it to him? I don't wanna say what it is because I wouldn't wanna spoil it. But it's a canvas and I wanna send this to him since your leaving Mat. I'm gonna miss you and I want you to know how much you've done for me in my life. So, is there a way I can send it to you?

Im so glad I get to see the old intro before you leave😊
“A theory, A GAME THEORY” I will always never forget that sentence❤️🥹
comments have nothing related to the video
Still find it funny that it says “Ruining your childhood since 2011”
Nice Another Theory! This Is Epic! Thank You Matpat!
The classic intro goes so hard
This intro is pure nostalgia, keep it
Only watched Markiplier play the first one, I feel like this is what mushrooms feels like
Thank you for ruining my child hood matpat we are all going to miss you.
9 left…
Love the classic intro! 😢
Who's going to miss this guy  👇
I'm 9 so I don't know the old theme song but it slaps
It probably won't happen, but I do hope that one of your last theories will be the Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 since we've been waiting for that game since forever!
Matpat is the only one who will theorize the darkest things about a game franchise that has just developed into a meme*... We're all gonna miss you... *It's a bit of a meme franchise at this point imo
DONT LEAVE US
Mathew Patrick aka MatPat* ,You have been more than just a YouTuber to me, you have been a guiding light throughout my childhood. From the very first FNAF theory video you uploaded, you given my attention and sparked a curiosity within me that I didn't know existed.  Your relentless pursuit of knowledge, your passion for unraveling mysteries, and your dedication to delivering well-researched content have inspired me in ways words cannot fully capture....... You have taught me the value of critical thinking, the joy of learning, and the importance of embracing one's passions🙂.  Throughout the years, you have touched the lives of countless individuals (myself included*) with your intelligence, creativity, and kindness. You have created a community that is supportive and filled with individuals who share a love for knowledge and exploration..  Thank you for being such an incredible role inspiration. Though you may be retiring from creating content, your legacy will live on in the hearts of all those you have touched. I am eternally grateful for the impact you have had on my life, and I can confidently say that you have been an center part of my childhood and will always hold a special place in my heart.....  (Watching your old theories, just hits different now☹️*)
Leaving before ruining my childhood. Gonna miss you, Mat.
the og intro hits
I'ma mis mat pat😢
Ty matpat for everything
10:55 - I haven't seen anyone bring it up in theories for Garten of Banban, but Shieff Toadster calls us "Mrs. Mason" so we could not be looking for just a child, we could be looking for the child. It would so explain why Flynn blames us so much and Toadster didn't want to trust us. It could also explain why Banban, aka Uthman, saved us at the end of the recent chapter because we are his partner. I don't know if it has any real evidence behind it but it's something to look into.
MatPat, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THE OLD INTRO!  Most of us are probably going to be sad that you’re leaving, but we’re glad you’re leaving us with some amazing theories before you leave.
Bye matpat I like the old intro
very confused did he finish chapter six feel like i’m seeing a lot of stuff i’m missing?
Matpat is a living legend
My nightmare is matpat leaving
I will miss you
I’ve been watching this dude for so long and yet i never thought he would eventually leave. I’m gonna miss you man.
that classic intro brought back so much nostalgia
10
Matpat pls stay 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hello internet welcome to game theory hits dif at the end of the theme song
If the last matpat game theory video doesn’t do a slowed down version of the intro with the original original opening to modern day that’s such a missed opportunity
MatPat be like My name is Optimus i have made this message to any remaining auto bots… We are here we are waiting
It has been ten years since I started watching Game Theory and Matpat... I am now 18 and so much has changed. Now I will miss Matpat's puns (didn't expect I would).
Gonna miss him,a hero to youtube
7:52 actually, I'm pretty sure it was Nabnaleena who got mond controlled there. See the bow?
Matpat your gonna be missed
When it’s all over soon we’re probably gonna come back and see the final video or the first Matpat made
Best channel ever
Yes hello
plsss don't do it matapat 😢
Dude... I genuinely started tearing up seeing the old intro
Literally made me so happy hearing the old intro again.
Man I missed that intro!
I was smiling a bunch before 1:06
The undertale sound for the theories left count is so fitting somehow
6:46 its that half life 2 "in the end"?
I was born in 2012
Im going to miss u so much matt
THE INTRO MY BELOVED!!!
We're gonna miss you sooooo much matpat😢😢😢 I might  not even watch your cannel that frequently anymore😢 your my childhood and goodbye
Thanks matpat for making me happy for 11 years
barotrauma
Bro im gonna miss you
What if ban ban took the kid (player's) kid because of the failed perfect child and he sent everyone after us/player to make sure we dont get the kid back and the jellyfish is the only one nice to us because they dont like each other and wont team up (idk if everyone is a enemy all i know is that most are)
8 theories left. We'll miss you matpat
Only nine more theories to go out of the entire series of game theory, and one of the last 10 is garden of ban ban Are you serious?
Nabnab looked like the Gaping Dragon from Dark Souls 1
Matpats the goat change my mind 😤
MATPAT
he summed up my thoughts upon seeing the title in the first 10 seconds
He wasnt ruining childhoods he was making them better
On march 9 is birthday that will be my most sadest birthday
-ruining- making your childhood since 2011
I absolutly love the Majors Mask reference at the beginning. I hope every remaining video has it. Im a huge LOZ nerd if you cant tell.
So my question is.. who's taking the FNAF theory mantle?
The classic intro made me, smile but also tear up, it’s bittersweet. Retirement better fricking amazing for you man, just like how you made our childhoods amazing🙏🏻🙏🏻
RIP Matpat, you deserve it.
Hiss last THEORY 😭😭
im going to miss him....inless this is the channel we have in 2024 ....i mean if this is where the line in the sand is ....and were settling for this ? garten of banban ? ....shoot the futures looking bleak XD
I broke down In tears when I heard the news you were retiring, this is my salute to what you have done for me, you helped me realize things have a deeper meaning no matter what it is, sad to see you go man 😭 bye...
garden of banban is about someone who is having a bad trip
hey Matpat you need to do your first intro in the video in one of your videos it would be amazing
bye matpat😭😭😭💚
I'm going to miss you ha that a theory a game theory thank for watching
Thank you matpat for everything you are a legend
This is really weird to be saying about this game of all games but it kinda feels like Stinger Flynn's journey is symbolic of a child yearning for freedom and struggling to stand on their own feet transitioning into adulthood - but never giving up hope.
… :c
Mat we will miss you
Gonna miss MatPat 😢❤ Also why are there so many bots in the replies
garten of banban: *incomprehensible BS and random events MatPat: Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out guys-
nooo matpat my birthday is march 9

Ruining my childhood more like making my childhood

My crying right now
Love the intro
I want to hear this dude swear on his final theory, just for the funny
FNAF hit rock bottom once or twice, but it ultimately redeemed itself. Banban grabbed the shovel and said, “Hold my beer.”
Thank you for everything matpat.... You made our childhood You can rest now
Matpat you made my childhood 😢😢
Mat pat you made my childhood when I was watching youtube when I was 7

I am going to miss MatPat so much. I genuinely think he's the only one I really listened to. Austin I liked as a host, but he didn't make things as exciting as MattPat
Thank you for all the years you entertained all of your fans❤❤
Omg old intro!!!!
Mat pat before you retire it would be cool if you made theory wear or website of some kind where we have to find the lore.
Matpat out here making this story WAY better than it should be   Also we LOVE the intro return
I’m gonna miss you matpat, cuz I won’t be able to see you theorize that much anymore since you’ve been quite an important part of my life like one-third of it was the theories, the channels, and you, but I’ll always remember it’s just a theory, a game theory:’) (thank you Matpat for everything you did for your viewers❤️)
Bro I can’t enjoy his videos anymore 😭🙏
Thank you matpat for being apart of my childhood! Game theory will always be in our hearts!🖤
I’m gonna miss you and your videos/theories so much matpat
thank you matpat
I reckon matpat’s final theory should be about fnaf 1, to really end everything where it all started.
2011~2024
I’m so glad we got the old intro music back 😭
I'm so happy the old intro was brought back it was quite nice to see after not having it for so long
Please don’t leave please
:( Nooooooo matpat😢😢😢 it Will never be the same😢❤❤❤😅
matpat once you leave and give your channel over (btw i love you content you are a legend) you should make a big final video that is every single video your in
We will miss you so much🥺
Don't quit please don't 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Like before Matpat is gone
No 9t
Great choice bringing back the intro.
Let's respect matpat for making it this far
Not garten of banban 😭
I'm gonna miss you Mat Pat...

His last theory

8:08 he said it😢
I will miss you me and my cousins watched your videos when we were young but they are two plus years older

Title: Welcome to Your Nightmare! Opening: 9 THEORIES REMAIN Me: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

We will miss you matpat
Thank you  for the intro 😢
God... I'm gonna miss you man. Thank you for my entire childhood❤
Classic intro lesgoooooo
Its just a theory
EPIC INTRO
Yeah i hope that he will be fine and i hope there's a new theory video so we dont be sad T~T
I cant believe the classic intro holds so much charm
Classic intro teleported me back to middle school
Matpat got 10 videos and chose banban
Bro I am going to miss him so much
Me: starts dancing crazy with the classic beginning 0:21
MAN I MISSED MATPAT AND THIS WHAT I GET BRO YOU TROLL ME😭😭💀
THE ASSIC INTRO ACTUALLY MADE ME TEAR UP
Matpat would you do one more genshin impact theory ❤
Hey Mattpatt I'm not sure if you'll see this comment. I was wondering if you could talk about this analog horror series called welcome to dreamworld? And if not you then someone else?
That og intro hit me like a truck
Ill miss matpat
I am going to make a comment for each of the last 9 videos. Video 1/9-10: (don't know if it's this video plus 9 or this is one of 9)  I remember my first few times coming across this channel. Back when fnaf was first coming out as popular, markiplier making videos. And, being young and, well, interested. I wanted to know it's story, and that is when I came across game theory. I am genuinely so glad I found this channel and enjoyed it as much as I did.
I missed the old intro, thank you MatPat for everything I will enjoy this last videos as much as I can
The thing about Garten of Banban is that the devs themselves clearly dont know what they are doing or even know what they are doing with the story. next game most of the stuff might get completely forgotten about or never touched on again or a completely different thing anyway.
The top comment is so true 😭 I literally cried
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKOOOOOO THE CLASSIC INTRO (man for real I'm gonna miss you I had you all my child hood and you made it amazing)
Thank you matpat for making my childhood even more entertaining and fun, well miss you matpat
. You were and always a legend you will never be forgotten you are always in our hearts souls memories you were my childhood matpat❤
I get it put I’m sad
THE CLASSIC INTRO BRINGS SO MUCH MEMORIES BACK
I remember watching him in 2015 like that
Ah... the nostalgia
SCIENCE BLASTER IS BAAAACK! I actually made a cover of it over on my soundcloud as an homage to matpat and a celebration of the game theorists and I am SO happy to see it return!
The intro made my day
Im done gt is not be the same without mat. Is he is done Im done too
9
Ah honestly still trying to process this… It been years of listening to you weekly. You will be missed my guy 🥺 Enjoy the freedom, live life and make memories with your fam 🥹
We’re still waiting for you to say jk
That classic Game Theory theme hit me like a train.
Does that mean that tom will take over the other channels?
BYE thank you for all you have done I wish wish we could’ve given you 100mil subs
Not being able to find any Matpat haters in this comment section is putting some of my faith in humanity
Dude I hope matpats last theory is a fnaf one, it would be so fitting
Team Theorists Forever, We Will Miss You ❤️
Please don't leave I'm killing myself tf you leave I'm just kidding hahaha I'm just kidding I'm just kidding hahahahahaha
Gonna miss you so much matpat, but I'm looking forward to Tom stepping into the hosting position and seeing what he's got planned.
im truly gonna miss you matpat
I will miss you
That classic intro just brought me into great nostalgia and great happiness. I will miss it so much.
Can you still be in some videos matpat?
dude why did one of his last theories have to be a garten of banban theory
I start cry as soon as it started
THE INTRO 😭
Is he only gonna retire to game theory or to all of them.
Bye mat pat only nine theory’s left bye it was amazing watching you you taught me so much fnaf lore and all of the lore of other games see ya bye
I still sad
It is truly the end of an era
YEEEEESSSSS OG THEME
2:41 ok, didn't see that comin also 5:26 nice skyrim reference
ill miss you buddy…
Thank you for making our childhood matpat..
Thank you so much for everything Matpat. Once you’re gone, I hope that you will be known as a YouTube legend.
matpat my last request...is  make a theory on raldi crackhouse pls
Is stinger flin CHEESE
7:50 I don't think that's Nabnab on the ceiling looks more like Nabnaleena. Considering that the baby Opila bird had to have the givanium crushed out of them, I have to assume that giant Nabnab is still roaming around or captured.
Will defently miss the diet coke ads
CHEESE
The old intro caught me off guard, never realized how much i missed it.
I wish you an advanced retirement day
I’m so sad he’s leaving we will all miss you, thank you for the next nine theories
Hope your new and cozy adventures take you far and safe madpad!!   Hope the new winds find you well
Wrong
Don't go matpat please
I know its such a small thing but I am so glad the intro got updated to show all 4 colors of all 4 channels. Glad to see it actually got fully completed after all of these years 🥲
Please i need more
I thought the into was going to be the OLD old intro
The intro
Matpat is king -lion king
7:51 Actually, I don't believe thats Nab Nab there under the group mind control. The glowing white part on their head looks too much like Nabnaleena's bow, matching what we see with BanBaleena's bow. I think we're sure to see Mega NabNab next game possibly on our side.
i will miss this guy I've been watching him since 2013):
Dear matpat from game theory can you make a need for speed theory video please.
feels weird… :P
Bro came back to post a garden of ban ban video just delete the channel at this point bro
matpat, I don’t want you to go man.
i really missed the old intro
That intro made me feel emotional. I’ll miss you matpat
Could you do for your next theory another slenderman theory
Salute the fallen founder of our childhood
Does anyone else think that Stinger Flynn could be that missing child he's always talking about freedom and making his way back he could have lived somewhere on the beach instead of him thinking about being a regular jellyfish he could be thinking about his old childhood and they took his DNA and put it in there and that's why he thinks that he supposed to be a jellyfish he could be a child I got tricked into thinking he was Stinger Flynn is the missing child😮
Man the old intro is, mesmerizing Also HOW TF DID BRO GET 600 COMMENTS?!?
Everyone will miss you matpat
Didn’t you just make a video saying goodbye internet and here you are posting a new video 😂
Bro I’m so sad😔
mat pat were gonna miss you😢
1M VIEWS IN 9 HOURS?????????????????
Let’s all watch every Fnaf theory
Its crazy to think that its been 13 years since you started this cuz ive only watched for only 4 or 5 of those years and your already leaving
Last one has to be on fnaf😢
Seeing the classic intro brought a nostalgic smile to my face fam 🔥🔥🔥
7:45 i love how he says "dark souls boss"

Ah yes. The best intro for the weirdest but one of the last 10 theories. Someday we'll see him outside. Sitting in a chair. And nobody there to ask him "Hey can you do that Game Theory thing?"
Bye bye matpat

There’s a very low chance that you will see this but I hope you and Tom stay in contact and I hope you revisited every once in a while I’m gonna miss you
Gonna miss you matpat❤ But i really wish tom the best years ahead for the theories!
Why did you waste one of your last theory videos on banban :(
I'm still sad
HELLO MATPAT I WANNA DO A DARE FOR YOU AND YOUR LAST 9 THEORIES ARE YOU READY FOR THIS MISSION?  BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE READY TO NOT SLEEP FOR A DAY OR SO.THE THEORY IM RECCOMMENDING IS KAMEN RIDER FRANCHISE
Seeing the old intro was so nice. Would be nice to see each older intro until we get to the original on the last theory
Why is everyone hating on Mat down here in the comments section? MatPat is my hero, and no one can tell me otherwise.
I based my whole life around game theory and getting answers in games and films, you arevmy role model
We will All miss you
Decem Theoriae! Decem Theoriae! Decem Theoriae!
I'm mainlining nostalgia with that intro music
You’re wrong one character that we seen but I don’t think the others know who he is only sheriff toaster does maybe it’s tamataki and camataki
(\_/) (¡^¡) />❤
Thank you, not just to you Mat but everyone working on all these amazing channels.We will never forget the work and effort you all put into these videos that so many call can call their childhood. We will never be able to repay you all for the memories that we have been gifted for so long. You are forever with our hearts and in our thoughts. We look forward to years more of the very same. Thanks for posting!
Bro we wiillll misss you
F-inghell,  I can't say how much I miss the old opening  S**t, i really gonna miss this
I still can’t believe he is leaving. The end of a legend
*- 9 THEORIES REMAIN -*
I really like the old game theory opening and always wish for it to come back  BUT NOT AT THE COST OF MATPAT DEPARTURE!!! WE WILL ALWAYS MISS YOU, MATPAT 🤧🤧🤧
matpat we’re going to miss u
A new era begins!
i can still remember when i started watching matpat. it started in 2021, i started watching him a lot which led me to this point it shocked me that matpat was gonna quit. I am greatful for your theories i loved these theories so much i keep watching his videos one after another. Thank you matpat
Please, please don’t quit we all love you❤😢
His videos feel a little off now cause he's leaving soon😢
What I thought he retired?
Wow 9 more...
WHEREEVER YOU ARE MAT PAT YOR ALWAYS #1
I think you should finish it off with fnaf
I am going to miss your voice
I am gonna miss matpat, the theories would cheer me up when I am sad and help distract me from ending
Old Intro 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭😭🎉🎆❤️❤️
9.
This is crazy I understand why he’s leaving but just seeing a big part of my childhood walk away it’s sad I hope he’s doing well 😢
The countdown begins
old intro hits hard man
Don't go
😢
Why WHY I miss miss him💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💔💔💔🥲🥺🥺
That intro brought bado SO MANY MEMORIES
Don’t go
CLASSIC INTRO LETS GOOOOO
Going to miss him
THE INTRO IS SO NOSTALGIC
Bye forever matpat
We’re not here for BanBan.. we’re here for you MatPat! ❤
Ban ban really?      aaaaaaa-
I think once he gives the channel to tom he should do the "BUT THATS JUST A THEORY. AAA GAME THEORY." At the end. He should also do the"hello internet, and welcome to GAME THEORY."at the start  Also I just wanted to say thank you matpat from the bottom of my heart... thank you
9 theories remain. 9 last episodes of our childhood.
We will miss you matpat 😢
Don’t put the ominous 9days left title it’s scary
When he's gone, we just have to move on. But hey, That's just a theory...
i've been feeling really depressed, i got momentarily excited because matpat's theories always cheer me up and realized i just couldn't watch it because it made me even more sad,
That intro never gets old
I’m gonna miss you so much Mat
him saying "effin" is the closest we will get to him cursing
Man, I started watching matpat back in the evil Mario and sonic speed theory era. It’s been a great run. You will certainly be missed
YES THE INTRO
I will be back here Mat when you're 70 just to hear "it's not just a theory"
I’ll miss waiting every week for a new video from you matpat
All of you saying who asked and that your content is way better you probably never actually watched matpats videos we have watched them it's such a big part of our childhood now it would hurt anyone that's watching his videos for even an year or so so shut up and actually watch his videos before you say that ur content is better even though you would just be making bad gameplay videos and then rage quitting within 3minutes of a match
I don’t think the perfect child is the one who we see the dreams point of view. If you continue ready the documents on him, he doesn’t get along with them, he commands them and treats them like they are less than him. Why would the perfect child be tagging along if it’s states he doesn’t get along with them and commands them.
I’m watching the FNAF movie and saw you and I was wondering if that was actually you
We all agree we will miss him but we gotta respect him hes done so much ftr us
Clap and a half to the OG intro!! I love you guys!
yo this channel is older than me i watched it since i was 7 and now i'm 12 and it took me 5 years to realize that i need the game theory original intro as my ring tone
Before you leave plz play deltrune chapter 2
I hope Tom Carrie’s the legacy in
Please do Minecraft and Pokemon plz
I don't like Tom ):<
Mat, you will be forever loved.😢
Hi childhood I’m going to miss matpat
Mabey we'll get lucky and he'll come back every now and again and do a theory or cameo. Maybe someday his children will become the hosts.
I'm in such a happiness cause of the intro ,I'm gonna miss it so much man.
That intro is my childhood
Can you swear for use just this once
The original intro goes so insanely hard
YESSSS!!!!! YEEEEEEEESSSS!!!! Can we PLEASE get classic intro for all of your last game theory videos???
I will miss you matpat :(        If bots comments on this, they like matpat.
YEEESSSS LETTSSSS GOOOOO CLASSIIICC INTROOOO I MISSED THAT SO MUCH!!!!
Bus-kun strike again
Bro why does everyone's comments have haters, like a guy is currently tired of making videos and quitting like stop BEING A BABY LIKE NO ONE CARES!!!!!...... i'll miss you matpat, it's like a father who likes to tell stories randomly that i never had❤❤
This feels fitting. Unfortunately. Banban as one of MatPat's sendoffs.
Boy this is gonna be much more painful than Vtuber Graduations 🥺
Nooooo don't leave us  But it's just a theory  A game theory❤
Goodbye Matpat you are a national treasure and will be missed
Thank you Matpat thank you
:(
I didn't grow up on game theory I grew up with game theory❤
Wonder what the last mat Theory will be
Getting closer!!! 😁😁😁
❤🟩🟥🟨🟦
Seeing the 9 theories at the start of the video made my heart sank 😭
We will miss MatPat so much, he legit was my childhood and adulthood. I was literally watching his theories while studying for college midterms/finals aaaaaaaaaaa
That intro brought back so much nostalgia
I ma miss you 😢 pat
Commenting on all ten last theories🥲
Seeing the classic intro again actually brought me tears I can't accept that your gonna be gone in just less than 2 months
Really wished you made a theory about omori... or finished petscop
Not me sobbing my eyes out at seeing that intro.
The existence of this channel will be remembered by everyone   TnT
The colours are filled guys
i thou that he leaft
lest us get him to 20 million before he goes
why, why does this have to happen, ive loved you and your channel so much, why did u have to do this to me man
It makes me so happy that the old intro is being bought back for these last few theories.. so much nostalgia!
Matpat pls dont go ❤😢
The final 10 THIS IS GREAT
I missed that intro
I had watch this since i was young.
The old intro completed is just, weird, but brings back memories
lets spread the word 'but thats just a theory a game theory'
We’re proud of you Matthew
Classic intro FTW.  Thank you for sharing the pain of Ban Ban.
in scooby doo  they see modern celebirties but it's set in 1960s
OMG I FLIPED SO HARD WHEN I HEARD THE OG INTRO
Goodbye MatPat
My favorite intro
We're all gonna miss u matpat❤❤
I can’t believe you’re leaving and on my birthday I’m going to miss you Matpat. I hope you do well 😊
All the comments filled with stuff related to goodbye matpat rather than the game or theory itself 🤣
o7
Matpat is the best, gonna miss him
Ngl thats really smart for garten of ban ban
Matpat keeping his sanity before he leaves:    GartenofBanBan
Matpat I will miss you a lot, live the best life you Can
Kinda think they should make a new intro when matpat leaves, like a new era
WE NEED ANOTHER FNAF VID BEFORE HE LEAVES
YouTube never be the same for me never be the same😢
Love the returning of the old intro, been missing that a lot. And same goes to MatPat.
Thank you matpat
day 1 of saying matpat
Thank you matpat for such great history and the fnaf theory🫡
Going to miss you so much mat!
These channels wont be the same without Mathew
I really felt that "thanks for watching!"
Seeing the old game theory opening made me tear up
Oh god British game theory!
😂😢❤🎉 Omg the old intro was so sweet!!! God imma miss you matpat!!!!!
GONNA MISS YOU MATPAT AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THE CLASSIC INTRO
i haven't kept up with game theory, but i'd really love if ya'll focused on theories on games that aren't necesarilly the most trendy. Yes Fnaf and garten of banban and skibidy  toilet, gets clicks. But there's so much other stuff to talk about. Recently buckshot roulette, Fear & Hunger, Pony Island 2 predictions. Just quick  ideas off my head
Thank you so much for bringing back the classic intro. It brought back so many memories and made my day hearing it again ❤
I really want them to keep the old intro so that we won't forget MatPat.
I hope you’ve prepared your team for the mass exodus so they dont get disheartened when you leave. They analytics arent going to be great to see and they cant let tht affect their work. Im going to miss watching game theory. It’s been… nearly 12 years since i first found your channel. I’d love to continue to support what you’ve created after you leave but, i’d be lying to myself and anyone who’d listen if i said i would. It’s not up to me, you know how we humans are, it’s just gonna lose it’s spark and to subject myself to it after tht point is just self flagellation. I’m going to miss you matpat, im going to miss… all of this. I hope you find the happiness and tranquility you seek after you step away.
Ohhhhhhhhhh myyyy godddd
I’ll miss you matpat, you were a big part of my childhood
9 more left…..
Everyone will
You should make a full version of the first intro
Classic intro W
1 L0V3 Y0U M@THU P@THU :C
I wish Matt and Steph the absolute best, I have so much respect for everyone at therorist and I wish the new hosts the best I can’t wait to see what y’all do with this amazing legacy of this channel
please dont retire matpat...
Bring back fatpat
MatPat why
MatPat how could you say goodbye when my birthday is next month on the 11th😢😢😢😢😢😢
When you hand off the channel im gonna think about all the moments you made me happy with "A Game Theory" Youtube will not be the same without you MatPat.
All goodbyes aside, this theory actually makes a LOT of sense. Even though this game is so globally hated at this moment, I still think that the consistency of the makers led to this game still being one of the most selling indie horror games(well if you can say that it is a horror game)
its not a theory its nostalgia
you know how gravity falls used a metal version of the main theme for the "final battle"? it would be cool if matpat used a metal version of the intro
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why is this like the first video I've seen about this? I literally have no recollection of any other Banban videos. I guess I've just been really out of the loop the past few months.
Its not ganna be the sane once your gone😢😢😢😭😭
Thanks for everything mat pat❤😢
oh I'm gonna miss you so much man, that intro just lit my day up
i will miss you so much matpat wish you the best and your family❤
GUYS GAME THEORY HAS BEEN RUINING MY CHILDHOOD SINCE I WAS BORN HELP IM REALISING THAT IM THE SAME AGE AS GAME THEORY
Who thinks Matt should make one final big intro
The internet will not be the same without you we’ll miss you mat pat 😢❤
Matpat please leave
Only OG's truly feel the pain of MatPat leaving.💔😭
You where half of my childhood matpat I wish you the best with whatever you end up doing
matpat will be missed
Grandpat hehe bye bye grandpat
9 theories remaining and bro uses 1 of them on garten of banban
8
Thank you for raising me when my parents didn’t want to MatPat!!
Great to see that Garten of Ban Ban is taking up one of mats final theory’s 💀
I have missed this intro
i only watched 1 mat pat video and i already kinda miss him
I love that he used the old intro. It’s so nostalgic
I love the old intro music ❤ we all will miss you matpat.
I EDGED to the og intro
Sad to see that one of his last videos will be BanBan… 🤢
The classic intro returned. It’s Beautiful
I hate to see you go I’ve watched you since I was 7 AKA 2020 the pandemic I’m now 11 this is very emotional for me you were in the top 5 favorite YouTubers to me
I have missed this intro more than I thought I would
Enjoy him while he lasts.  That intro was so nice to hear again
I’m not crying you are
Question dosent this make it feel like the player is a scientist who considered perfect child to be their child ?
I'm gonna miss you so much  because I have watched you'r videos for 5 years😔😔
You are one of the reasons I still watch youtube😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
i,m gonna miss him he was the best person to watch when I was younger and stil now
IT'S JUST A F*** THEORY LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!
When you retire, just to let you know MINECRAFT HAS MORE LORE THAN YOU EXPLAINED
It will never be just a theory it will be our childhood thank you so much matpat❤
Hello internet.. welcome to matpat's retirement..
I hope the last theory uses the Chiptune version of the intro theme.
Thank you for entertaining me during the hard times man I cried when you released your last video😢😢😢😢❤
The intro 😢 is just nostalgia
First lyinja dies and now matpatt is retiring this has been one sad year
I never realized I missed the classic intro this much 😊
Are you passing down in all  channels
That OG intro made me a little emotional...
Cried when I heard the intro😢
CLASSIC INTRO SPOTTED CLASSIC INTRO SPOTTED  Oh now I feel better. Now nothing is wrong in the whole wide world. 🍀
No, No, NO, NO ,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It kinda just hit me, I watched the entire. Ideo and I was sad, but the intro being the original hit me so hard
Thank you matpat your videos help me get through heartbreak and sadness you will be missed 🫡
A classic intro
THE OG INTRO 😭😭😭
IV’E BEEN WANTING THE OLD INTRO FOR SO LONG
I'm going to miss matpat so bad, thank you matpat...

Paying my respects 🫡
it's been forever since Iv'e heard that opening jingle
Every MatPat theory i watch now, knowing its coming to an end soon fills me with bitter sweet appreciation ❤ congrats on a well earned retirement, OG Internet Dad
I hope one of your videos are valorant or brawl stars since BS has new lore and valorant has a lot to cover!
OOOOOOOOOO the og intro brought me so much nostalgia! I'm gonna miss matpat so much
I'm gonna miss you matpat. I've been watching your videos since my freshmen year of high school and it's because of you that I've been inspired to come up with my own film and game theories. I've even been currently coming up with a game theory on the origin of the Sonic.EXE Creepypasta and how all the games and stories in that genre started. ❤️❤️
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!!!!
thank you
Can we please see all the other intros from the past?
Don’t go matpat please
hope u have a great life matpat
The music at the beginning almost brought tears to my eyes.
This channel is gonna die when he leaves
THE CLASSIC INTRO 😭😭❤️
"But thats just a theory a game/food/film/fashion theory" an important man said thiz

THE CLASSIC INTRO NOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭 MATPAT WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCHH
When the pandemic was happening I (it was christamas) would watch the grinch theory. But seeing you go like this brings tears to everyones eyes😢
This game literally made me out of special ed classes. He’s the guy who made me smart. He is the guy who made me the guy who I am today.
Thanks for all these years of memories matpat. We’re all gonna miss you.
Its gonna be so different without you Mat. We are all going to miss our favorite theorists. ❤❤
I will miss you very very much Matpat for all the theory you have cover up you made my childhood better, thank you comrade
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!!!!!!!,
14:40 I thought he was concluding ngl
Watching this only for the last 9 theories and I gotta say… I understand how non Fnaf fans feel now
Ruining my childhood sincei was born
Let's have a theory sendoff for MatPat:  What do you theorize is MatPat's last theory?  (it doesnt have to be from Game Theory, it can be from Film Theory, Food Theory or Style Theory)
We’re gonna miss you mat pat
THE CLASSIC INTRO IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO CRY
seeing the intro genuinely made me tear up oh oh this is so bittersweet
I am who I am because of you, I wish you well in your future.
Nabnab didn't get mind controlled it was Nabnaleena
The intro made me cry

Its not a happy place for end
“Hello Internet! Welcome to Game theory!”
The brain rot is real
I am watching this without having watched a single Garten of Banban video EVER. So all the names and stuff are just so nonsensical to me🤣😂
Man I hope that the new theorists keep the old intro- WAIT DID THE ENDING JUST EXPLODE
Matpat I love you video please don’t leave us
The intro!!!!! I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!!!❤❤❤❤ I guess I love you too matpat. ( That's I joke I do love you and everything you do)❤❤
Baulders gate theories?

My theory on Garten of Banban, its a owners tryna show how little our attention span is.

To be honest I didn't know MatPat finished banban 6. I thought he got half way and had to stop.
I'm gonna cry at every one of these
Ah, I missed that intro. Five bucks days that the last video MatPat does will have the very first intro
Matpat is vibin lol, Gonna miss the dude
Can the game theory make a theory about Tears of Themis?
Something… just doesn’t feel right. 🫡 we will miss you man

OMG MATPAT IDK IFF YOU SAW MY COMMENT ON YOUR VIDEO ABOUT LEAVING BUT I WAS BEGGING YOU TO PUT THE OG INTROS IN SO IF THAT WAS WHY YOU DID THAT THANK YOU AND I ALSO THANK YOU FOR MY CHILDHOOD

That intro made my fricken day. Thanks for bring back the classics Matpat
The times ticking matpat and you make this :/
Just the sound of that opening almost made me cry
I loved how he decided to bring back the OG intro
one of the last theories or one of the last reasons to not freak out
We are so sorry the boys are invading these comments we are trying to get rid of them mattpat we will miss you
Im gonna watch your some last eps I just wanna say: it's aint sameway without you
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Dont leave us 😭, its not the same
Ik this is a bad idea but i think it would be cool if you made some tipe of yourtube show or like a in space with markiplier tyoe thing staring you. Personally i think it could be really cool.
I watch this channel for so long and never commented so when I heard Matpat was leaving I was sad he was so I'm commenting one thing and saying goodbye Matpat it was a great journey all these years watching your videos
The start of the end.....
Matpat be like with banban: are we really doing this ? I mean are we really doing this? well great
matpat, are you gonna be there to play poppy playtime chapter 3?
Sameeee ;(
Everyone subscriber will miss you matpat
THE INTRO GAVE ME SUCH A SEROTONIN BOOST OH MY GOD  Enjoying these last theories like my last meal fr
I’ve been waiting for a garfilled theory…   Huh
We will miss you 😢
YAYAYAYSYSYS THE CLASSIC INTROOOO MY CHILDHOOD FRFR
I am unsubing after matt leaves
That intro felt so breathtaking for how long it’s been.
f
Wait why don't we see any dead body's or any humans at all is this an alusion????theory???
Man, I’m gonna miss MatPat after the hundreds of theories he has made. Hope Game Theory is still the same after he leaves.❤
Matpat thank you for everything make sure enjoy with your family thank you matpat❤️
thank you for a wonderful childhood matpat
Is this a garten of banban reference
Old school opening is so nostalgic 😢
Thx for bringing back the intos!
Goodbye dude😢
I can’t believe he’s wasting this on banban.
I wanted to make a correction in your video. The spider in the final scene isn’t Nabnab. That’s Nabelina. If you look closer, they have a ribbon, not a party hat.
7:45 nabnab ISNT THERE, thats nabnalena
The fact that the last video was a ducking Garden of Ban Ban episode 💀
Just one library of ruina theory before you go...
I still love that classic intro
8 MORE THEORYS TO GO!
Oh man, I can’t believe how much I didn’t realize I missed the old intro
This teaches me better than school.
i thought he left
Nah seeing the old intro hurts more
2024 the year of ends   I subbed I didn't know who you where until 3days ago but I might have watched you before I think
love that og intro
It isn’t gonna be the same😭
Goodbye mat🫡
Ik you gotta, but dont leave mat…
He didn't ruin our childhood since 2011. He made our childhood since 2011. We gonna miss you.
We’re gonna miss you matpat 😢🫶
Thank you Matt, we really gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, Matpat...
I MISSED THAT INTRO SOO MUCH
I love how he isn't holding back anymore!
That intro sequence hit me so hard with nostalgia. I do wish he did his very first animated intro but this one was still great.
How do you know what happened in the second half of the game?, if you only played the first half... and how do you know the name of a character from game 7?? I think you needed to save the theory, and upload it after finishing the game in the other channel  and maybe start game 7...
I’m gonna miss matpat so much ❤ and can you make a Thomas theory
WE GOT THE INTRO!!!!!!!!
If you don't want matpat to leave like
Glad to hear the old intro again 🥹 and maybe for a finale MatPat can have the OG game theory intro before he passes the torch.
Did the GT live video not come out yet?
Pls do a zelda theory
Nice to see someone was inspired by Dream theory at least
dawg this is one ofthe 9 theories its over
pls do fortnite lore
8
I I hold heartly support dad Pat on his decision to do whatever m************ thing he wants
Gods, I didn’t realize how much I missed the old intro
Bye matpat we will all miss you just know that we all love you and wish to see you again some day😢😔
We all will miss Matthew Patrick, but he deserves the break. The motto he repeats is, "Ruining your childhood since 2011" while in actuality he helped build it. I myself cried watching the Goodbye announcement so much that I couldn't even finish the video, and very few things makes me cry, the other being the ending of Gravity Falls. Farewell, MatPat, we truly will miss you.                                         PS saying Matthew Patrick (MatPat's legal name) is weird
Still so bummed about Mat Pat leaving
Oh that nostalgia from that game theory theme song AHHH! gonna miss it all!!!
You've brought us so much joy and I have no doubt that these new theorists won't fail to bring that same joy with they're own twist sore long matpat
I am going to miss Matpat so much When he goes away :(
you should go back one iteration of the theory per theory. so its the og one on your last theory.
We will sure cherish the memories we have with matpat no matter what ❤
💚💛❤️💙
THE INTRO
MATPAT PLEASE DO A LITTLE NIGHTMARES THEORY NOW PLEASSEEEE
Were gonna miss my man  The brother we've never had..
i'm gonna miss matpat, but not these kinds of theories
Hey Matt, can you do a video on buckshot roulette?
Wow, matpat really tearing in to this franchise. I need to go watch that last gtlive and find out why he seems so vindictive.
That’s just a theory, the last theory!
😔
„216 HOURS REMAINING“
Its not a game theory , ITS A THEORY , A MATPAT THEORY
can you do an epic mickey theory (I know its random I just want more oswald)
9 Lefts, I also want to see them coming but I also don't; cuz that means Matpat'd finally go to the back of the curtain and we'd barely hear his voice anymore :<
It just feels so right to have the old intro back.  It feels perfect.
Don’t leave us Matt
I will miss matpat
Im miss you matpat
Aaahhhh, the dopamine when that classic intro hits!
I’ll miss him very much! It won’t be the same.
This might be hard and we might not make it, but can we give Matpat his well-deserved 20 mil?
You still have not explained anything about slow Seline
I was born in 2011😢
Maybe these called the 10 theories
I used to comment on your account back then when you said sans is nas or whatever it was but you better save 5 theory’s for fnaf
I'm gonna miss you matpat, but all of us will always remember you, you will never dissepear in our mind
We are all gonna miss you mat but we will welcome Tom

As a favour pls don't change the logo
Let’s stop bumming about the future and appreciate what we have left
Thanks for everything matpat!
Why does your merch costso much?
Omg I miss the old intro😊

Finally we see the game theory intro with all 4 slices
I’ll miss you
The nostalgia hearing the classic intro then with announcement of matpat it's going to be missed

Epic intro as always
If mat pat does a tf2 theory I will scream (in joy)
PLEASE DONT LEAVE US 😭
0:46 oh god, I missed that classic intro.
980,000th view!!
You will be missed dude. Please don't get rid of the outro! Matt your recording specifically. "It's just a theory, a game theory!" That is as iconic as, "lest get ready to ruuummble!"
"9 theories remaining" There better be a "honorable mention theory"
Do ARK survive evolved plz befor you go
.. I.. uhm wow
I still dont know where the organic 2d renders come from
If Fnaf ever comes back with a new game MatPat should be a special guest
Man the nostalgia
You made me cry with the old intro
dude i cant -_- hes leaving
matpat should de-evolve the intro every episode
im gonna miss ya matpat..
Matpat you always be my dream and everyone will honor you
Thank you matpat for creating our childhood, you be miss but remember as legend.
I understand why you are leaving but personally I will not be clicking on as many videos sorry matpat  no offense whoever but you will have to earn my views you can’t just convince me to watch because of past content
YEEES ORIGINAL INTRO
Man, seeing skibidi toilet as most trending in 2023 makes me sad
i bet matpats last fnaf theory is with nightmare fredbear
Feels weird knowing this is the beginning of the end of an era.
It was so awesome hearing Science Blaster again!  I kind of hope Tom ends up getting his own unique intro for when he takes over the channel, but we'll just have to wait and see.
Guys we only have a couple of mouths with our favorite theorist so let’s give him so put some fs in the chat for matpat😢😢😢
I really think the channel should end with matpat
we'll miss you matpat 😭
Dude I’m going to miss you
first: i love the classic intro with all 4 spots of the theory logo full, it makes me emotional second: whenever a show is ending you are obligated to watch the intro and closing sequence third: please matpat, make casual content that you post whenever you feel like it. think of it as like a blog channel just for you, no team or anything — just content about you just so we can keep seeing you :(
The last episode better end with “Goodnight internet, goodbye game theory.”
UTTP sucks
Matpat really hit me hard with that intro 🥹
The classic intro never hit so hard
Let's just hope that Tom is equally has funny as matpat
We will miss you no matter what happens ❤ matpat
guys we get to see matpat a few more times
We’re all going to miss u Matt 😭
Seeing the classic intro was almost as emotional as the going away video
AHHH SO HAPPY to see that old intro. And seeing all 4 lights be different makes me so happy to see
Ever since I was a kid, I'd have dances for my favorite theme songs. When the original game theory theme came on I immediately got up and did the dance I haven't done in years! Such a nostalgia hit!! Thank you Matpat for the amazing memories!!
I don't know what the last theory will be, but I hope it'll be a recreation of Matpat's first ever fnaf theory.
The 4 segments have finally been completed...
CLASSIC INTRO
Omg seeing the classic intro with the fully lit up logo really gave me chills it came full circle ❤
We will never forget you Matpat you were my life my childhood go live your life you do really deserve it 😢

WE WILL REMEMBER YOU MATPAT
I’m going to watch these final videos even if I’m not interested in the topic
I'm gonna miss matpat so much and I just want him to host the heavy lore theories such as poppy playtime, fnaf, etc..

I wonder if he’s one hundred percent done with the channel or if he might be in videos here and there
zoinks
the way i smiled when he said “we are bringing back that classic intro!”
Gonna miss you Matpat😭😭
We’re going to miss you Matt pat ❤
We are going miss u so much matpat
I'm going to miss you too much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
it is sad hes not being host any more but yall saying he quittin in general.  he saId hes still going to make the video ideas and stufdf, he ssaid that in the video.
Fnaf got to be the last theory
We will miss you matPat you're amazing
matpat the goat
Oh my god can everyone calm down it's not like he's dying 😭
Hey Matpat, I’m sad that you’re leaving. I mean like who isn’t. But what I wanted to ask you was if you can see how many matches there is in super smash bros ultimate like you promised. Please, I’ve been waiting so long for it. And thank you for being a big part of my life. Love you man. We’ll miss you.❤❤❤
I swear MatPat is going to be more and more ruthless with each theory. First he hates on toxic fans now he says effing?! Btw the OG theme slaps!! Please keep the theme song.
Ill never recover from this😔
see you later, matpat; you were one of the best
I mean the classic intro would be the 8bit one but I will take the rock cover none the less
Matpat is now going to stop ruining our child hood :(.
WTH is happening in the comment section
*9 theories left.*

Hi matpat I've been a fan of yours since your channel even started and I know this is Game Theory but on film Theory you didn't finish the happy Meat Farms thing so before you go do you mind if you finish the thing that you started please also I love you my bad I'm going to miss you❤😢
We're gonna miss you, Matpat 😔
Guys we gotta get this video to 1 million likes.
Knowing what's coming this was painful to watch
his vid will never be the same
PLEASE do a lethal company theory
Thank for being here
I don’t know if Mat will see this, but I just wanted to thank you for the years you’ve given to the internet. We’re gonna miss you so much but you deserve a happy retirement!
Dang :/
I’m not hyperventilating in a corner crying you are. The og intro made me so happy and I’m actually gonna like miss MatPat so much me and my older brother grew up, I used to yap about his theories nonstop.
we love you bro you were there when i had nothing to watch you were there when no one post bye bye man
Well.. this is his last video of theory...
Thank you matpat
Yo, tell me why my eyes got teared up when I saw the original game theory intro I’m gonna miss this man too much
THE OG INTRO😊
Looks like im never gonna see mat make a bugsnax video, it wouldve been legendary
It would be really cool to finish with a fnaf theory
Glad to see the classic intro make a return, we'll miss you, MatPat!
Grandpa pat please visit
Yall dont reply to the UTTP guys they just want attention
Ahh looks like Nostalgia
I think if the channel would’ve been with both MatPat and Tom it would be funny
THAT INTRO IS HYPE
I’m going to miss mat pat and I really hope that it doesn’t turn in to a T.K.O.R        Situation
I’m gonna miss you. You are my childhood
We Will Miss you
Yes finally all 4 corners of logo are in the right color in og intro
UTTP is attacking MatPat and say that they are glad that he is quitting. Please stop UTTP also I know that you are working with the boss from shorts wars.
Og
man one of the last theories im so glad to be alive to see these
the real nightmare is matpat leaving permantly
garten of banban skipping from 4 to 6 reminds me of how mumbo skipped from 4 to 6 in secret life
Mat even tho you might not see this you are the person who made me who i am and you shaped my childhood thank for all you have done you are on of th best YouTubers ever 😢
Is this the last ep about you
Rlly sad you wont be here for the very soon 20 FREAKING MILLIONS
I always love classic intro
REST IN PEACEEEE 😿😿😿😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
matpat...if your seeing this...at least show up and visit us at some points so we can still at least see you...i don't want *poof* i want at least once 2 years or 1 year
ahhh even tho hes leaving he still doesnt fail to entertain us
God dang it that intro was nostalgic
Thanks for the intro and all the memories!
matpat, i will never forgive you. please don’t leave
this theory looks silly
Savor these last moments
Thanks for bringing the intro back
the countdown in the beginning got me in my feels😔
I’m gonna miss you bro
The clasic intro is so nostalgic im so sad for mat pat to go
Is it bad that I started crying when the og intro played
Maypat can you still be on the channel a lil
I hope matpat will come back and make a video every now and then.
I don’t watch him much but, I think I’ll watch his last 10 videos.
All the comments are just gonna be sad “I’m gonna miss you” comments instead of actually commenting on the video
thanks for everything matpat
I don't really like tomlad
old intro hits so hard we're gonna miss it so much
Im gonna miss you😢
Thank you matpat for everything. Please dont stop making videos. 😢😢
So happy to see the og intro used.
I don't really like tomlad
I can’t believe I just headbanged to the game theory intro song
Matpat = sigma
I love the classic intro so much dude
The intro is nostalgic and so amazing
Im here 7 hours... And im gonna miss game theory with matpats voice
This all is just a theory a game theory 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I'm so sad that he is leaving
Game theroy should hide his channel name somewhere across his channel and in his last video he would say "My channel? If you want it you can have it! Find it! I Left everything this channel has to offer! In one piece!"
I have missed that intro SO much!!!
im gonna miss matpat so much dude
Was I the not one crying whenever he played his old intro😭
Noooo not the classic introoooo
We'll miss you matpat
I love the old intro
that intro broke ma headset because i was vibing too much
We need to cherish everyone of these videos we have left before Matt leaves to live his life out with his family. 🥰🥰😭
Lets be real, matpat will still make alot of camios
Im gonna miss you so much IM SO GLAD WE GET THE OG INTRO AAA
God.. I can't even watch your videos now because I'm so sad that you're leaving... It's all painful
“Don’t be sad because it’s over be glad because it happened.”- A wise man
Goodbye Matpat :(
NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I literally had Luke Skywalker’s reaction to his announcement video.
I'm not crying tour crying
Thank you so much matpat
you should slowly go back through all the theory intros
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This is the final count down , well it's been nice to be in this generation, bro still gave the classic intro too, I'll be waiting to see what matpat would do in the near future.
Bro plz don't
I really hope that he has a tattletale theory in the final 10
That intro is so nostalgic it really made my day
7:50 I have to correct you there Matt pat but that’s not nab nab that’s his ex wife nabneleena
The British are colonizeing the theory channels
How tf u uploading if I went??
For matpat: In the end of the game nabnab didn’t get notified it was actually babnalina you can see from the purple thing on her head
Gonna cry we'll will miss you man
Nonononono
Matt IM NOT WATCHING THIS. I've been a fan of Game theory for years but I cant stand to listen to this. This game feels like a parody of mascot horror
i love you man its gona be so sad.
The goosebumps from hearing the intro again is unreal
I don’t even care for this game but at this point, I’m watching all of his videos here on out. 😭
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO!
Man I missed the old intro
😢 i’m actually going to cry….
Come on bro you have to theory murders drones
Matoat should cover help wanted 2 for the last episode since fnaf was one of the fan favorite episodes
That’s not the classic intro
Mat, please. The one thing I've always wanted is for you to do a video on Slime Rancher. I'd hate to see that chance go to waste. I hope you agree.
im so glad that he used the classic intro before he will retire, ima miss u matpat
Heres hoping for a D2 theory there is SO MUCH possibility  Im gonna miss ya, matpat 😢
Thank you for everything Mat.
I already miss you so much
I think he's leaving the internet because making theories is slowly making him crazy, and now there's no coming back
The last video HAS to view FNAF. It HAS to
I'm trying not to cry. You always make my day. You're the reason I have friends ...literally
ill miss ya matpat
oh my god!!! the classic intro!! so much nostalgia! makes me so happy :.)
Please, please, please bring back the old intro permanently.
7:50 that nabnableena you’re talking about. Nabnab is still alive and well (except being a horror monster)
Imma miss u
Out of every game, this one  Still will miss ya though
im gonna miss you goat 💚❤💛💙
Matpat don't gooo
I was never interested in garden of banban but with 9 theory’s left I decided to watch
Deciding to point this out now banban is just like so innocent like with the "morning sleepy fellow" like it's just adorable almost like he's a child so yea he's also kinda my favorite so yea that's why I'm pointing that out
🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡         We will miss you MatPat
Hearing that intro gave me chills
Bro already completed all of the achievement. So he quit youtube so that he could have an achievement in real life
I can’t explain how much my eyes lit up when you told you were bringing back the epic intro. Poor Tom, the mess of Garten of Banban is his problem now :’)
As much as I’ll miss you MatPat, at least we got to see a classic intro again.
chills when I heard the original opening song, literal chills
0:21 Yass! The classic intro!  Ruining your childhood since 2011. (:
Man, bringing back the classic intro brought a huge wave of nostalgia. We’re gonna miss you Matpat! Thanks for entertaining us for 13 years!
It would be awesome if as the number goes down the intro gets older until it’s the first intro (it also would be a final send off to the intro. At least with MatPat)
gonna miss you man take care
im gonna miss you, but one theory i would like to see before you go. ultrakill size 2 fish, do some research im sure you will find some stuff
We’re gonna miss you so much
I cant look at this  theory normaly now. Im gonna miss you matpat. We will miss you
I want the real classic intro
As someone who has made the like button 99K into 100K, I am proud.
Matpat Matpat Do a vid on dark deception the game please
The original intro gave me chills we will missing you Matpat
Ah, man, classic intro with Matpat. So much fun. Xoxo Will miss you, Matpat, but, I AM looking forward to seeing what Tom does!
The intro is always great
matpat is god inside a theorist body

Something about seeing the classic intro with the theory ring complete is satisfying
Bruh idk why everyone acts like he's dying
in crying you are one of the biggest factors in my life i dont know what to do when you leave i made my whole channel to be like you
Dang😢, I won't lie seeing that classic intro brought back so many memories ❤
Matpat and game theory were my roman empire. Were gonna miss you Matthew
Love seeing the og intro!
But hey it just a theory. A game theory (goodbye matpat)
TOM?! SERIOUSLY?! HIM?!?
I barely wanna watch this know a couple more videos until matpat leaves
this is depressing,
I was trying my best not to cry....
not the intro its way too nostalgic 😢
First we would be interested in the theories, now we cry.
We're gonna miss you im crying right now bye
The og intro being brought back for these final 9 theories is truly one of the very few things I craved
Love this one MatPat!! I’m gonna miss you heapppppps😭 I already cried.

ive been watching game theory for a while, over ten years, i will miss you matpat
Please at least keep matpat saying welcome to game theory when he leaves
You should only do fnaf at least, when you are gone. 😢
At that point im leaving that child.
That classic intro just hits different with the knowledge of the upcoming transition
The intro almost made me cry
😢😢😢😢😢 I'm gonna miss you matpat😢😢😢😢😢😢😔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
gotta come full circle and solve fnaf once and for all
I'm going to miss matpat so much I started watching matpat at 2012 in my mom's phone actually.
I say bring back the classic intro permanently. I miss it
We'll miss you matpat

Classic Intro is fire
Will there be…a fnaf finale?
THE INTRO WOOO

Im going to miss you more than  anything matpat i hope you hqve a great life with  your family like you deserved
Why is 90% of the replies bots💀
Gonna miss you mat pat
Day one of being here until my favorite YouTuber retired
The intro hits hard to this day
I missed that intro so much
Aghhhh! THe final 10 videos!!! I'll really miss you matpat.❤
I would like to see one of your last videos to be about lethal company
Didn’t think I would see this happen
Bro, I thought you retired
I will miss you so much!? my man! Noo😢😭
We will truly miss you MatPat, thank you for everything... :(
Classic intro goes hard
I don't want you to leave MatPat
If the last video isn’t a theory about Matpat being Scott…     I’ll still watch it ngl
Waiting for UTTP to reply to my comment...
I’m so sad that matpat is leaving us 😢😢😢
The final times of Matpat
Maybe we are the cow when we actually got recarnated the cow who killed us maybe that's us nobody knows the cow so maybe we are the cow
Man, that intro hits hard in this context
I watched your is link dead in majoras mask video back in 2013 when i was 7 and ive been a fan ever since. Thanks for making my childhood matt im gonna miss you
Glad that one of the games he wants to cover before leaving is garten of ban ban. A very weird, chaotic yet endearing game. We're all gonna miss Matpat but excited for what's to come.
I just realized that he not only brought back the og intro but changed it by adding style theory to the 4 colors that light up.
Great start to the final ten! Looking forward to see where these final projects go, thank you for the past 10+ years :>
The classic intro goes hard
bro wasting his last days on this game
I remember talking about matpat 9 years ago when i first discovered his channel. Now here we are, 9 more theories left till he's gone.
THE INTRO!!! IM GONNA CRY!
Don't cry, don't cry, you are a man.
Bye matpat. :(
Hope you will come back sometime
9 remains guys..
Yoo, they brought back the intro music!!!!!!
aaaa 9 theories left 😭😭
Do chrono trigger last
I'm gonna miss my childhood theorists
👺
Gonna miss you matpat. Thanks for providing the greatest theory videos.
8 to go 😭😭😭😭😭
Goodbye matpat you will never be forgotten
What are series like banban and fnaf are gonna do without matpat doing the writing for them
I'M SO BITTER SWEET ABOUT HIM LEAVING LIKE I'M EXCITED FOR THE NEW GEN OF THE CHANEL'S BUT IT'S SO SAD TO SEE HIM GOO
im hoping Tom does well but i do know MatPat will be missed
you guys are wondering what uttp is than here Uttp stands for utube troll police   Uttp is a group of kids on YouTube that say they attack trolls but there trolls themself most of them are 14 and under there very toxic to any fandom because they mad it has more fans than theme so it is a lot of attention-seeking kids  Also don’t go to their channels or like their comments or just report for spam
Before you go please make a theory on deltarune chapter 2 please
I hoped they would bring back the old intro for this countdown and I am not disappointed! When I was little I would tap the screen when the lights on the logo would show up. I still remembered the pattern ☺
One thing tho: The spider in Sir Daddadoo’s army isn’t Nabnab. Why? Because if you take a closer inspection at their head there is a *bow* .That is not Nabnab but instead Nabnaleena. So that pain Nabnab got while trying to defend the others maybe the pain of losing a loved one.
I LOVE the Majora's Mask reference at the beginning I thought I clicked a different video at first lol
I keep downloading every video he makes now so I can watch them just in case
why cant we just watch a matpat video without comments having nothing to do with the theory and just about him leaving
you missed something in fnaf world
Matpat please don’t quit you can just take a break from you tube please don’t quit
The old intro though 😩😩😩, I’m gonna miss MatPat dude
Please don’t leave us dude
I did not expect garten of banban as one of the first 9 theories but sure-
Play American Arcadia please, matpat.
9 theories left 😭
the old altho not oldest game theory intro i love it i cant be the only one who has missed it
❤matpat😢 will sincerely be missed
WHO THE HECK IS TOM?
I’m gonna miss you mat pat we all will you were my childhood it’s a little emotional I hope you enjoy your retirement. I guess this is goodbye❤️
The classic intro gave me SO MUCH nostalgia
When u leave mat I’m going to miss u even I have not watched all your vids I watch A lot my Be for 3-1 years
I really wanna see GrubHub theory 3 before you go
Matt Pat please Poppy playtime releases. Please play the game and make some theories on it.
Bro fr making me wanna know more about garden of banban💀
YESSS CLASSIC INTRO
This is the first film theory I’ve ever watched. I’m upset that I wasn’t here earlier, but at least I am here while I still can.
MY HEART WHY WHY MATPAT I WILL MISS YOU
I LOVE YOU PLA DONT LEAVE
Sea my man
😍
o7

At 6 seconds the song One Final Effort from Halo played and it took me a minute to realize it was from a different video. Also if you haven’t heard the song, look it up now.
we are gonna miss u matpat
Pls don't quit
Bruh hearing the old intro again almost made me cry 😭
I like how he updated it, so then icon flashes it shows the colors of the other channels
Hearing the old Game Theory intro again actually brings me ungodly amounts of joy, thanks for that <33
OH MY GOD, THAT INTRO IS MY CHILDHOOD, I WILL MISS YOU FOREVER MATPAT
CLASSIC INTRO ROOOCKS 🤟🤟🤟
So it begins. The moment we've all been waiting for.    It's the Penultimate Tally...
If you didn’t already know matpat, we will dearly miss you.
i missed the classic intros so much, PLEASE bring it back
I cannot express how beautiful seeing the classic intro is
We will all miss you Matpat.  😔
I hope the last theory from matpat is FNAF related
Going to miss matpat! So much nostalgia from both this channel and the old intro. Losing one of the greats, but for the best!
Ah yessssssss the original intro❤❤❤
9 videos till mass unsubscibe
Pov you're looking for a comment that doesn't mention matpat leaving
Who's not ready for him to leave?
Should definitely have it where over the weeks the intro keeps getting older until for the final theory with matpat has the very first game theory intro
Tom I'm begging you to make a Dream BBQ/ ENA theory once ENA: Dream BBQ comes out 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Going to miss you matpat
He has 8 more vids left
The last theory gotta be FNAF
The bots in the replies of comments is scary.. anyway we will miss you!
A

Nothing beats a Theory from the past, Theories from the present deserve the love past Theories had. Thank you Matpat, 9 I am counting down each video
The intro was so nostalgic

❤

I'm some how as old as Game theory
The video explodes at the last second 😂
The Amt of stress tom is going to have to bear needing to now stand up to matpat levels of iconic
Classic intro🫡🫡😭
I’m gonna miss you 😭😭
Matpat and his theory team may have been ruining childhoods since 2011… but they made up for it by giving us new memories, especially matpat.
All i ask is that the 2nd to last is the OG, and THE last is a timeline of all of the intros in one go
the OG intro literally made me cry😊
That was nostalgic
NO WAY HE DID IT HE DID THE CLASSIC INTRO
Count
Hey Matt Pat, if you read this, I wish you well man and who knows maybe when your son is older he’ll carry on your legacy
Man i am so happy to see that into again!
YESSSSS CLASSIC INTRO!!! THANK YOU MATPAT!!!! 😭😭😭
Gotta get as many mat-pat theory’s as I still can
broooo the classic intro goes so hard. THE NOSTALGIA
what if the small zophls in banban 5 is the your kids
The last thing I want from game theory is to make a undertale theory about the AU’s descending into the underverse.
We will enjoy your video until the day comes.
Report all bots
Finest slop, garten of banban theory
the handoff better be handled with an onscreen handoff, like they do in super sentai!
Classic intro gave me the chills 🎸❤
-8 theories T_T
Thank you.
What if this was his last theory video
I cant believe im watching a banban video... anything for Matpat though... 😭
do scp lore
9 LEFT thingy idk what its called hut that was cool
Man the OG intro...
We're going to miss you so much MatPat 😢
Thank you so much for the years of entertainment Matpat! I hope you have a happy retirement =)
one of the last theorys is GARTEN OF BANBAN BRUH
You just had to hurt my soul bringing back the OG Intro ;-;
9 left
I’m already missing him even though he hasn’t left yet 😔
Omg it’s the original intro I am going download each last 9 videos
❤️
the og intro just make me start bursting in tears
there are 9 theories so at least 4 of them are definitely going to be fnaf
Yeah really hope that poppy playtime 3 will come out before his retirement because I want that to be the last one (hopefully)
0:41 bye matpat
Seeing the Intro again hits with hard nostalgia.
W intro, had me dancing in the gym. I'm gonna miss you matpat ❤️
Guys he does theory vids so it's just a theory maybe he won't quit
Your last review better not be FNAF theory
We're going to miss you MatPat😢
“Ruining Your Childhood Since 2011”  Dude, Game Theory has been making my childhood since 2011. Kind of wonder if we’ll still see the classic intro after MatPat hands the reins off.
9
:(
I WAS SO HYPED WHEN HE SAID THE CLASSIC INTRO!!
Man
ngl i cried when i heard the old theme
Matpat I understand why you leaving but I’m gonna miss you
having never heard of this game before im somewhat confused 😂
:(
Mattpat thank you, you really did make my childhood a bit special ❤
The classic intro hits HARD
Oh god I never realized how much I missed that opening
I wonder if, the further we go, the oldest the references will be.   It'd be neat to see another Super Amazing End Card Tournament.
gonna watch every new theory until the end now.
Im really going to miss matpat, but change exists
MATPAT BACK AT IT!! WOO!! THATS MY BOY!!
Oh how i missed the intro
1 small thing. We don’t know nabnab got mind controlled. The bows light up, so that is clearly nabnablina
Not me tearing up and its just the intro!?😥😥😥
Matpat will be put in the youtubes best  channels and will be remembered for ever
seeing that classic intro was so nostalgic
I know your leaving and we hope to see you at least a few times this year love you matt ❤
This matpat guy is pretty cool, he should have his own internet show!
Matpat was one of the only youtubers I actually loved fully. Thank you for everything Matthew.
March 9th is basically judgement day
I AM HAVING ENOUGH OF UTTP I DONT CARE IF THEY SAY FiRsT wArNiNg NO ONE CARES THIS IS GOING TO FAR MAT PAT NEVER DID ANYTHING TO THEM I WILL LITERALLY SPAM REPORT ANY UTTP MEMBER I CAN FIND and i hope anyone seeing this can do this to
"stinger decideds to capture a rescued banban" im 90% this will be one of the only mistakes in these last few videos
Matpat will be truly missed
Would it really be too hard just to clone mat pad and just have him hosting Game Theory I think that would make everyone happy
Half life
AHAHSJSSV SEEING THE INTRO BRINGS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF HAPPINESS
On march 9th all of us fellow theorists should change our profile pics to game theory and say that’s just a theory in the comments
I hope matpat can cover the CROW64 before he retire
Oh my fuvking god of course the UTTP is after mat during his last moments on youtube
I am going to miss matpat my dude 😭😢😞
I'm gonna cry when matpat retires
😢
THE CLASSIC INTO LETTTSSS GOOOO
Im gonna miss you MatPat 👍
"Goodbye matpatlington the Great, You shall be missed"  Freddy says with a tear in his eye as he pushed your raft out to sea only for Afton to take his bow and set the boat aflame. tears are shed amongst the crowd as you ascend to Valhalla where you prepare for the great theory war to commence.
Im really gonna miss matpat... I was crying this was so unexpected goodbye
Gonna suck not watching this channel anymore
I love your videos matpat and we will miss you!
Bambalina
ngl, the intro should progressively get older and older
The last video Marist ever posted should have been a gnat theory not… NOT THIS??? 😭😭
You carried my childhood bro😢
We gonna miss you man
8 videos left :(, we'll miss you matthew patrick
When MatPat is 70 years old he is still can be able to perfectly do the “Hello internet! And welcome to game theory!”
Cant believe we wasted one of matpats ginal theories with Gartem of BanBan of all things
CLASSIC INTRO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (im in tears i want to hold on but im happy.)
🫡 each comment is one f in the chat to Matpat
We’re going to miss u matpat but we know that the Game Theorists Channel and the others will be in Great Hands
Please don't change please
We love u matpat
We love you matpatt <3❤ And we will miss you so much
Not the 9 theories left...
I’m sorry what..
HE BROUGHT BACK THE OG INTRO YESSS THANK YOU MATTHEW!!! ❤
Chapter 7 is gonna be different without you matpat
I’m so glad we have a Banban theory from Matpat ❤❤❤❤❤
The intro. 😢 how I missed you
Hope im not asking something i shouldnt, but whats Matt going to do after not being the main theorist.
if we end on the Bioshock original intro, it would be a beautiful full circle
It's just sad how such an influential YouTuber is leaving and he announced such a heartfelt goodbye video but the UTTP thinks it's just a way to try and fill the void in their hearts that was taken once their parents left
Yaaaay the classic intro music!!!!
Mat please don't go
8 left😢
i will miss you so so MUCH
Im gonna miss him....but at least i still get to watch his videos❤
Beyond happy to hear the intro again. It has been missed just as much as MatPat will be❤
9 left...
I absolutely love how this Matt just doesn’t care and it’s absolutely amazing 😂
THE CLASSIC INTRO AAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I’m gonna miss mat
i think everyone is going to miss matpat
Absolute tear jerker when i heard the og intro
AHHHHHHHHHHH
So glad that intro was at the start, reminded me of the matpat early days 😢
mat may i request for 1 last genshin theory?
I'm praying we at LEAST get ONE Piggy theory from Mat before he leaves 😭
Ever video a gem. And a sad but happy memory I'm Gonna miss you so much
Gonna miss you MatPat! Have fun in retirement
It’s just a theory. A GAME THEORY!!!  -matpat :)
i have a theoriste i know why banban keeps on following us and helping us and keeping himsefy and it must be the player  bf i dont know if this si right
Bruh
What am I going to do without matty patty 😭
May pat, please heart my comment it would make me super happy and make my year 17:48
YOU SOOOOO COOOL
9 parts left let’s hope it still lives and we get comfortable with the new host
The old killer theme song! At least MatPat is giving us what we love. I'm sure gonna miss him when he's gone
Definitely a bit sad the 9th to last theory is... Banban... But hey, it was very fun to see the intro, hopefully it'll stick around for the other 8 as well, maybe even bringing back the true OG intro from the old old days, with the original non-remixed version of Science Blaster
Ooohhh. Ive missed the intros
0:20 finally the info is back. How I missed it. But I don't think Style theory has an Intro at all.
I’m gonna miss you so so so much mat :’(
Where gonna miss you, MattPat🫡🥺
The fact that matpat stopped the video just to put the og intro is truly nostalgic, i will miss you matpat
I'll miss this channel it won't be the same without matpat
9 theories to go before I stop watching from this channel
I hope Matpat's last theory is a FNAF theory, the game he's made the most theories on
His last theory is gonna be Poppy Playtime I just know it
I hope that you comeback soon when you leave I really hope your not gonna be gone permanently
Why am I starting to care about garten of banban
more fnaf  vids
CLASSIC INTROOOOOO
The first out of nine theories have started….
Skyrim mentioned. Goated banban
I always wondered what would happen to our fav youtubers. I guess they just quit
YAYAYAYAYYAYAAY YASAAAAAAAY
8 more after this and I’ll need like 10 full tubs of ice cream
Bring back the Old game theory like 2009 that is super nostalgic
Wish you the best of luck in life mapat
Please keep up that intro! At least until MatPat's finale!
...
YES THE CLASSIC ONE HOW I HAVE MISSED IT😢
Only watching this for Matt’s final 9
We got eight videos left. Enjoy them.
Interesting
Its not just a theory, it's our childhood. Thank you Matpat ❤️
Matpat i hope you will help somewhat behind the scenes
Miss the classic intro so much, Thank you Matpat ❤
this is 9/11 for 12 year olds
OLD INTRO!!!!!!!
from the quote "9 theories remain" to the classic intro is nuts I went from "nooo" to "let's gooo"
Anyone else sad that the one of the last theories left is about garten of banban. ill still miss him a lot tho he deserved to be happy with ronny.
Gonna treasure these nine theories
I shall cherish the last nine theories ❤
Seeing the classic intro made me so happy. Thank you MatPat, thank you for making theorists out of us.
8 last theories to theory.
Dude thanks for bringing the old intro.❤
Miss
That’s still not the classic classic intro, I remember a Mario one too
i remember the first theory video i watched was a film theory and when i discovered the other channels i thought the were clones of him 😭
im crying at the old intro istg-
The theorist king is passing on the thrown the a new king to be the new theorist of the internet  You will be missed legendary theorist matpat R.I.P 🕊🕊🕊
we'll miss you matpat :)
Bye matt
What if the last theory [of MatPat’s hosting] is a premiere?
Hey matpat so uhh can you a theory about buckshoroulette in one of them?
Well miss you MatPat! 💜
That intro gave +10 nostalgia points
I been watching matpat for a while on different accounts and I will miss him 😢
We all will miss him
Matpat will forever be in my heart
Yo! Get me that intro OST!
dudes just gonna act like nothing happened
NOOOO PLEASE DONT LEAVE
i really hope we get a poppy playtime theory before he goes
Omg matpat trd=&/#<56÷4÷_5
The classic intro goes hard asf ❤❤
YOU ARE THE BEST THEORIST I HAVE KNOWN
The classic intro, it just hits so hard
Thank you for making videos for us for 14 years we will miss you
His last theory..
I kinda wish he did a second splatoon theory since the series have evolved
That intro hit me like a bus
If you see someone whos spamming something about UTTP, report their account for spamming then block them, dont reply, or they'll get the attention they want, (which they never got from their fathers)
I love the energy of *These dreams ACTUALLY  mean something!* This game is like fnaf on lsd
TRUCK KUN NOOOOO
i know this would be a lot to ask for but, i wish so much that once a year we’d have one normal mat-pat video.
Lol I'm crying watching this 😁👍
Seriously THIS is one of the big 10?
That Intro genuinely made me so UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED
I’m gonna miss him. The old intro gave a nostalgia trip
ah,
Man, I miss the classic intro and I'm going to miss MatPat as well.
3/10 final theories
Well 9 theories to go, hopefully my suggestion of Valorant finally gets done
We will Remember you matpat forever😢
I was waiting for classic intro, sucks that retirement is is the cause
I missed it but the last video was Matpat at 666
i want matpat to host again when we finally solve fnaf😔, 2 or 3 years from now on
Why😢
Who else missed the only intro
So he have 9 theories before he leave
Cummed when I heard his voice
LETS GOOO THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!  We'll miss you Mat, your chaotic neutral attitude, your theorizing skills, and your awesome red jackets.
Thank you....for the video MatPat..
Take care matpat
THE INTRO WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT IT. i can’t deal either mat pat leaving
you will be back on 12/25/3001
Why did one of the last theories have to be taken up by garten of banban 😢
The beach is def dagons domain :)
Day 1 of saying sans is ness until matpat tragically leaves
Don't quot plz I beg you
I'll miss your insane theories so much, I'll miss you
I have a theory gua the bus hit us in that dream
Thank you MatPat.
Ignoring all these bots, we’re gonna miss you MatPat, thank you for everything you’ve done, we all love you and will miss you. Wishing you the best wherever life may take you.
W MatPat
The fact that the rest of the generations of kids r gonna be watching game theory without matpat scares me
I’ve missed the old intro! Fitting for the final 9 theories 🥺
AW MAN THE FINAL THEORY... WISH THIS NEVER ENDS.
9 theories to go...
I will miss you Matpat  thank for the playing old intro 💚
4:54 Not to mention that automaker lobbies were responsible for said marketing, as well as the invention of jaywalking and the demonstrable misuse of land. If anyone's curious, I recommend urbanist content creators like Not Just Bikes.
Dark deception theory please.....  Before you leave 👉👈
We will all miss you.😢
Were gonna miss u
Bro why was one of his last vids on garten of banban😢
Y r you leaving yt
I'm really gonna miss Matpat as the host of Game Theory. At least he is still the creative director
What will happen...after...all of this happen
You made me cry when you brought back the intro 😢
....... not going to type anything but this until the next eight theories
You deserve everything MatPat❤ thank you for all these years❤ your channel has brought my so much joy❤ I hope the best for you❤
W Mat
I’m gonna miss you 🥲
it's an ARG, he's not really leaving..
Were gonna miss you matpat 😢

MatPat's getting real philosophical this episode.
Guys let’s all rise up as we witness the final 8 theories by matpat
MATPAT we will miss you pls come visit your fellow theorists we love you❤❤❤❤❤ (also who's Tom?)
i can't believe matpat had TEN theories left and was like "one of them HAS to be garten of banban"
Didn’t realize how much I missed the old opening till it played 🥲😭
Going to miss you Matt pat 😢
Ill miss him
Gonna miss you!.....Don't respond to this comment bots.
Matpat will stop making theories exactly 10yrs after i first started watching him...crazy ill miss him
MY theory is that the final episode may be on fnaf, ofc, or the first franchise matpat ever made a theory on...
I can't let this era go without commenting. Thanks Matpat, cause you have done so much for me and so many others. Thanks for making our lifes just that tiny bit more special.
Game Theory is older than me. I’m gonna miss you MatPat 😢
You will not leave our memories nor our hearts we thank you for forever "ruining" our childhoods, you will not be forgotten Matpat we love you and hope to see you again.
i'm gonna miss matpat the goat of youtube.
I’m not going to watch a game nor a flim theory until a return
I need a Plants vs Zombies theory
thanks matpat, i shall remain until the end
Hearing that old music in the intro almost had me teased up. Even if it’s BanBan, I’m gonna enjoy these last 9 theories. Gonna miss you matpat
Pls terraria theory
Matpat after raising a generation of kids without grooming them: 😎😎😎
Bye 😢❤❤
Going to miss you matpat
Can't believe he's leaving
Thank you so much for the intro
Yo @bangercontent sort ur life out don't be so rude yeah thanks
Classic intro 😱
I hope to see the channels first classic intro sequence on the last episode for the nostalgic rush, I'm gonna miss you Mattpatt.
the goated intro indeed
y’all i literally cackled when i saw this theory was garten of banban and then you just had to use the old intro and make me cry again
Matpat I will always miss you and you will forever be a big legend👑
i will miss you so much matpat,and thanks for your clasic intro.  everyone give a W FOR MATPAT!!!
i don’t get a hoot about banban but outta respect for matpat i gotta watch this
The classic intro! The classic intro is real!
Finally! Classic intro returns! I've been missing this so much.
it would honestly be so cool if as we get closer and closer to the end, we keep seeing the previous intros until we get to the very first
THE CLASSIC INTRO 😭
Honestly I think wacky and kinda dumb ideas and games are what make the channel so fun and interesting, definitely taught me more than any biology class ever did, Happy almost retirement MatPat! We’ll miss you and look forward to your cameos and that ARG!!💚💚
Ok in my own Theory a game Theory in my own Theory I think stinger Flynn is was designed to make someone forget but clearly that's a fail because he has the power to put us in dreams some so I think he can change a person's thinking of their child and make it forget but somehow we are the character that we're playing is are mother who is trying to find her child and maybe her child is the most important thing to hurt in the whole entire Earth so I think stinger finish trying to make her forget about her child and maybe her child could be dead that's just the theory a game Theory that's a my theory in a game Theory just saying
I grew up with matpat!! 3mo after i started intensively learning English id watch his theories...its been almost 10yrs. From 9 to 19 i cant believe he wont make theory videos anymore😭😭 ill miss matpat
Dear MatPat:we are all gonna miss you also i cried for like almost two hours straight when i saw the video you are the heart and soul of YouTube to me ❤❤❤ happy retires Going back to my emo depressed faze for the rest of my life 🥲
NOOO MAT PLS THE LAST THEORY BY YOU BE POPPY PLAYTIME 3
Wait is the intro going to change
Agh the nostalgia of the OG intro just hits so well... maybe your playing as the not so missing child?
3:09 in fairness the first 4 fnafs released within 3-4 months of each other but i'll admit scott definitely put more love and care to the game as opposed to banban having weird ah children drawings terrorizing ppl
im gonna miss you
I don't know anything about Garten of Banban. This was a trip.
For the past couple years if I clicked on a video and it wasn’t Matt, I’d immediately click off, so looks like after March I won’t watch Game Theory anymore, especially Austin, so annoying, I agree with SML heavily
THE OLD INTRO
Please make the last theory an entire vid of you explaining your final thoughts on the fnaf lore😭🙏
You do not know how much i love the old intro, its nostalgic.
Mat i will cherish every last theory u do also I really missed the old intro
Needed that intro in my life, so hype
Gods i hope his final episode is a FNAF theroy it would be fitting
I'm actually crying so hard rn
I thought the classic intro was the one with 8-bit Mario walking past screens playing video game footage and then jumping into that equation.
matpat has 9 more theories left to do and he wastes one on garten of banban slop...
1/9 :(
One of the final ones! I absolutely love it
Matpat truly chose the darkest timeline and made it lighter🤣😭
THE CLASSIC INTRO YEAHHHHH
Nnn
CLASSIC INTRO LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I've never ran back to my seat so fast when I herd the old intro
I would not watch this video If matpat wasn’t levaving
Matpat is a true legend
Dam I missed that old intro
WH THEORY SOON? UHUHUH JUST NEED MORE SPOTLIGHT DONT LET THE FLAME DIE OUT!
:/
I'ma miss him so much I cry fr
Yall hes not dying 💀 (we will miss you matpat <3)
Who else is only waiting for the Fnaf vids?
Yea classic intro
Crazy that the 3rd iteration of the Game Theory intro, which I remember vividly making its first appearance, is now "classic." Makes me wonder what will happen for it when Tom takes over. Regardless, MatPat, you will be missed. My entire childhood, I have had you to rely on. Thank you for all you've done.
We are bringing the classic intro    Bro that hit so hard and different
You were my Childhood...  Goodbye Matpat
Bus=Gus, Chocho Charles lore
0:26 finally we have them all
Nnnnooooooooo don’t be gone
The old intro is amazing, ill miss this guy sm
Miss you matpat,We appreciate your kindness and support in your videos,We will miss you so much
I thought if anyone was gonna take over it would’ve been head editor Dan since he’s already done a few theories before
The og into I'm crying I'm screaming ❤❤❤
😰😰😰🫡🫡🫡
THE INTRO MADE ME SO HAPPY!   I'm gonna miss you Matpat, I'll cherish your videos forever.
as one of the last 10 theories, to be honest i was a little dissapointed but overall godo job
please make the intro older and older as we get closer to goodbye!
NOOOOOOOOO
WWHHHYYYYYY i just got skyrimed in this video.......
I’m so disappointed about Mat Pat leaving but I loved to see the original intro of Game Theory
Im so glad you brought back the final intro, thank you so much
WAITTT TOM IS GONNA BE THE NEW GUY?!?? I'm gonna miss you matpat so much but knowing Tom is next makes me a little less sad

🫂

thank you for everything matpat
If the last theory isn't fnaf related I'm going to combust
its sad to see matpat go i hope he could do a pikmin theory before he does
Hearing that old intro made me smile so big! All the memories came rushing back. I’m gonna miss you Mat, but I’m excited to see what Tom has in store as well
PLEASE DO SHORTS WARS SEASON 2 BEFORE YOU GO
I really hope he doesn’t Quit his other channels because that would be really sad because we heard him in the beginning that he was going to quit this channel not all of them      But that’s just a theory a game theory😢
I'm not a fan of BanBan but I'll watch all the last videos you'll upload MatPat
Mat gonna miss you i would like you come and go a little in our life's 😢
I'm going to really really miss you matpat

We will miss you matpat but remember it's just a theory a game theory
1 down. 9 more remain.
it's my birthday matpat, mixed feelings a day that becomes a countdown... loved the intro though
I just got hit by a wave of nostalgia in the first minute
Are we able to get older and older sets of the introductions with these last few theories, and the final one being the very first game theory introduction?
The classic intro is my ring tone!! ❤❤❤
I don't understand why they stopped adding the intro. Which idiot in analytics said intros are not necessary?
Wait a sec he back?!
THE OLD INTRO!!! ❤❤❤
I’m gonna miss him so much
17:46 *headbanging to the intro outro*
You started this channel the year I was born and put out the video that you’re quitting the day after my birthday and dude it sucks to see you go thank you for so many great videos
I'm reporting all theses bots they are spaming and its annoying
Seeing all four channels light up the icon in the “old intro” is something I never thought I’d see. Love you Matpat. Thank you for my childhood.
This game was so bad i couldn't even get through watching it, let alone playing it.  Thank you for the key points MatPat !
I wish matpat takes all back and says it was a prank or something that song in the intro was so nostalgic and it reminded me its gonna end and soon
Do a piggy theory for your last ones
We're gonna miss you so much MatPat
Well miss you
We’re gonna miss you and thank you so much for everything
Yes the old theme song
Tell matpat come back OR ELSE
I'm gonna miss this
gonna miss this fr
15:06 getting skyrim intro'd in a GT video was not in my 2024 bingo card
petition to keep matpat in videos  👇
MatPat is the only dude that could make me sit down for 18 minutes and listen to a lecture about this garbage game
After those 9 theories left i will push a boulder up a mountain for eternity 😔
tom gonna drive the channel into the ground
We will miss you dude, there are eight theories left from MatPat, the last eight videos of our childhood. ❤❤❤
It's so heartbreaking to know that it will only take matpat to depart just for us to hear the iconic intro again 🥺
Okay but imagine the intro getting older and older (versions) as we start to approach the last theory 👀
ima miss you like if your sad
The last video…. Ever😢
im gonna miss matpat so much dude
Farewell MatPat, thank you for everything ':)
9 remaining.....?😢
We will miss you matpat
RIP MATPAT😭😭😭
I’m nearly cried watching this old intro part 😢
Matpat question! Will you stay with the game theory team? Like behind the scenes and such!
God im gonna miss matpat so so much
Why can't you be the parent in the dreams? Please someone help me.
this is not real he’s gonna post later guys idk what ur talking about ahahahahah
YESS OLD INTRO
He just has to remind us
I'm gonna miss you matpat😭😭😭
Soon...nothing will be the same as before!
One question: Do you retire from ALL of theorist channel or is it just the game theorist channel?
Looks like the beginning of the end my friends
the intro 😭😭😭 I'm gonna cry
Starting the sendoff of mat pat with a completely random garden of banban theory, never change man
Kills me he's leaving
I can't live with out those theory of his
My brain did not at all realize that the      intro changed XD I have no clue why
lethal company when... even if matpat gets a replacement
😢 The old intro is goated
I wish the style theory would have its own intro music
I sense UTTP in every comment
What about Deltarune  chapter 2
We are going to miss you Mat-Pat. The thing we will miss the most is your cringey dad jokes.
Matt is using his last bit of energy to be very honest. Wow.
Goodbye Matpat after these last 9 theories my childhood Youtuber will be gone when I saw that goodbye internet video I was in tears for ages theories wont be the same without you Thank you for everything
Seeing the complete game theory logo, it fills you with determination
All i can think when i watch hos videos is how much I’ll miss him
On MatPat’s 666th video on game theory, he announced he was retiring.
I can’t believe he brung back the old intro
dont leave matpattt
I can't believe that a banban episode would make me cry
i’m gonna miss you, my YT childhood dad MatPat
Ok matpat we NEED a splatoon video! It would be so cool to see a fully completed splatoon timeline with some theories thrown in!
YYYYYEEEEEESSSSS! THE CLASSIC INTRO!
Danno draws said you are the inspiration for his channel
matpat doing garten of banban as one of his last videos is so funny, reminds me of when sakurai added minmin as one of his last characters
hearing that music made me so nostalgic
I’m gonna miss matpat
Last theory better be finally solving Fnaf.
love u bro
THE INTRO IS REAL

Thank you for keepin me entertained since I was 9🥹

Love the classic intro
9 more to go… until he moves on
Matpat 😭😭😭
OLD INTRO LETS GOOOO

We will miss you matpat. You built all of our childhoods.❤
O7
MatPat is my childhood, helped me through the lockdown, gave me something to look forward to while struggling through college, and now wrapping up in 9 more weeks. I’m so sad that there’s an upcoming end, but I can’t wait to see what the future holds of the channels with the new hosts.
soemtimes i forgot this is a horor game
bye matpat...
I’m going to miss mat pat sm 😕
Ruining your childhood since 2011 in fine print got me😢
We will all miss you
I wish he doesn't go but if he has to he should come once every now and then to make sure he is ok
Mother flicker only 9 more
i will miss these, i will really miss them, thank you matpat
Legend
I remember when I used to watch the old videos with the classic intro and get chills just waiting for matpat to say the classic "HELLOO INTERNET"
Matpat is leaving and it's all YouTube's fault.
As soon as mats gone I'm probably gonna follow sute it just won't be the same without him
Man I love matpat it’s a shame he has to go  but I understand why he’s has to my favorite theory was the duck season one
MATPAT, YOU'RE BACK!!! PLS DON'T RETIRE PLS, WE LOVE YOUR VIDS 😢
I love how the "old intro" is a remade version of the old one to include the new channels as well as new games you've talked about
is it just me or the fact that he is going to leave is quite strange?
OMG THE CLASSIC INTRO ✨NOSTALGIA✨
CLASSIC FU*KIN INTO BABBY
Now way...
Missed this intro
Dang... The original intro. Im more sad now. :(
Oh man i wish matpat gets to make the last theory about poppy playtime.
I DONT WANT YOU TO LEAVE YOUTUBE

THE CLASSIC INTROOOOOO
I’m still waiting for a forgotten hill series
The OG intro what I love about it even more is unintentionally the beats kind of line up if you sing to  green red yellow blue to the beginning part
Can’t wait to here the old intro just a couple more times
I'm miss you very much but seriously ban ban
Matpat please dude Your the only one who knows the whole fnaf lore
I’m gonna mis him yarg
I want. No need the old intro for all the remaining 9 vids
i'd like to see matpat do more roblox theories i mean we only got like 1 or 2.
We need a MatPat uncensored for his last theory please
I have a theory that on the 9th video is gonna be on April 1st
should have been fnaf
PLEASE DO A STELLARIS THEORY!!!
8 vids left……….
well will always miss you thank for being a piece of our childhood thank you
I hope the last MatPat hosted theory video is on the Game Theorists channel with the ORIGINAL original intro. That's the best way to say goodbye.
Ur leaving on my birthday bro😢😢😢😢😢
imagine if this was his last video
yes
My life is officially fulfilled now. Seeing the last part of the intro glowing up blue is all I needed
I hope we get to see the even older intros, maybe with newer twists.
Gonna tell my kids about this channel🫡😔
Only og knows 😔
Wow, i never thought of Garten of Banban this way, i always thought it was just a rushed game with unexplained silly moments.
E
We still have till like march 13  Still very sad :(
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened~Dr Seuss
Well at least Tom is replacing mat.
The way my heart jumped seeing the old intro😭 im gonna miss matpat sm
18:05 boom 💣
I love you man, but why did it have to be banban?
yeah idk what im gonna do without matpat
instinctively turned up the volume just for that classic intro
We're gonna miss you Matpat
I loved YOUR content
Please this whole retirement thing better be a joke😢
Only caveat I would add is that nabnab is never shown under the naughty ones control, that’s his female counterpart I think? Don’t bite me I haven’t seen the seventh one yet.
omg i cant believe that this sieries is ending. live the rest of your life, and i wish you happiness matpat. live your life to the fullest.
i have no idea what garden or banban is about im just watching the video cus i know it will be one of matpats last videos
Matpat is still here😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
What if the orange jellyfish was the player characters child?
You used to say you ruined childhoods since 2011 but you  shaped mine. Thank you matpat for everything ❤️.
classic intro hit me like a truck, im gonna miss him
We love you Matpat!!
I’m still going to watch all the old videos
No lie I thought you were going to play the og,first theory intro for the opening.
did I miss an episode of gtlive or sm all I see that's released is part one
I don’t know what garden of ban ban is but I’m watching this for you mat Pat ✊😔
We need  Scott to bring Matpat back of retirement
Can you do lethal company next
Don’t go man 😭😭😭😭😭😭
🫡bysñe some day matpat
ARRRGHH WHY WAS HIS LAST THEORY THIS?!?! DONTT LEAVE WOTH THIS PLEASEEEEEE😢 Edit: ooohhh never mind we got more theory’s
I would love for matpat to continue GT live, i dont really wanna see him leave just yet
I would say that’s a real big shoes to fill Guy that might, as will be a planet to conquer but I wish him luck
Matt are you still gonna do shorts and gt live and make cameos after Tom takes over?
NOT THE CLASSIC INTRO 😭😭😭
Mat I texted u on Facebook  the one who made u the picture! I hope u liked it😅
man I cant take the countdown 😭😭  THE OLD INTRO????
Do an arg please as your last video that will let the one who solves it become a new member of team theorist
Seeing the old intro before his retirement is giving me chills
thank you matpat for all your vids me and my uncle loved them i wish he was here to see you go
Please do a lethal company one
Yes I love old classic intro 🥰😊
I really hope the last theory is fnaf related just makes sense to send matpat off with one final fnaf theory
Not a fan of garten of banban but feel obligated to watch this
i cant even describe how happy i am to see the classic intro! thanks for everything matpat!
what if the child stinger took was the parents childed
Bring back all the old intros and have a medley of all of them for the finale please
I do hope that the Theorists channels survive while MatPat is retired. He is the face and voice of the channels since their conception meaning that without him it will be hard for the team to keep the ball rolling. I really hope that they do, and change works in the favor of everyone! My best wishes to the channels, and going up the hurdles of the aftermath! I am rooting for you guys!
9 days until the party
We'll all miss you Matpat
God. Hearing the old intro made me feel so happy inside
A giant smile on my face when the classic intro came on

I will never forget you
After all these years who would have thought that one of the last ones would be about banaban :D
ok can we just real quick talk about the lights in the intro finally show the right colors of all the theory channels. It feels like thanos collecting all the stones. AND NOW IT IS COMPLETE
Today my friend bday party. I like how he posted the goodbye vid on my friend bday and first theory on party day
It feels weird knowing that this generation is going to grow up without matpat.
YES THE INTRO!!! But it will be gone soon…

I really appreciate it that matpat still bringing the classic intro and also making jokes of him stepping down as the role as the game theorists.  I’m going miss you man thanks for changing my life as a youtuber and making videos that were inspired by you.
Skipidi toilet is terrible
7:25 truck-kun is too strong.
Definitely going to miss seeing him in the theories
9 theories remains. Pain.
I’m so sad that mats retirement is 8 videos away I’ve watched him since I was 5 and don’t know how to react
The ring has been filled
I kinda would love one of these to end up with the "Super Amazing End Card Tournament". Just for nostalgia's sake.
They need to bring back the old Food and Film theory intros
MATPAT U GOTTA DO SHOTS WARS 2 B4 U GO LOL

W Theory  W Matpat
Man, I'm gonna keep watching all this till he finally takes his leave.
8 more theories ...
9 theories remain…
I littirly cried
Not gonna be the same
Am I tripping or did they change the YouTube channel name, wasn't it Game Theory not The game Theorists?"
I'm glad to see matpat enjoying himself. It's like watching a hard working old man finally get retirement and trusting his company with Tom. I wish you the best Tom excited to see how you continue the series ❤❤❤
Yo matpat thanks for al man
Why did the first one have to be ban ban
PLS SNIFF
The og intro goes hard
So, for the new guy replacing matpat, here’s something, sir. Dadadoo and queen bouncelia is the parents of the naughty ones (the small slug things) with Dadadoo’s head and bouncelia’s ears
Brought back that masterpiece!!! We love to see it
when matpat is gone this  channel will die
We will miss you and thanks for everything
Play your last series can it be the thing that I've been asking on GT life it's called Welcome to Dreamworld
why does this game exist, and who was the crazy person that made this game
Gave us a count down and honestly I can’t wait to see what matpat does with his future thanks for making our childhoods so special
Honey! A new Episode of Game Theory starring MatPat just dropped!
We will all miss him, but the legacy of the game theorists will live forever!
I love the fact the classic into now features the colors of all four channels 0:25
Im gonna miss Matpat. (I literally never heard of 'Garten of Banban')
"Ruining your childhood since 2011."  No, MatPat. You did quite the opposite.
Pls don't leave
MAN HE BEEN DOING YT FOR 14YEARS WE LOVE U
why does bro have to remind us at the beginning of the vid? :(
tysm matpat
Who else feels bad for Tom having to solve BanBan in the future, poor guy

Where does the cow ballerina fit into all this?
We're going to miss you Matpat 😢😭
I’m gonna miss matt so much 😭
The tears I have watching all these final theories are happiness tears. I'm happy that I got to be on this journey with you for all these long years. And I am very excited for the future on this channel with Tom as a host. He's a delightful person whenever he shows up and also on his own streams. If I only have 9 more chances to say this, I will say it at every opportunity I still have: Thank You Matthew. For everything. 💚❤💛💙
I’m gonna miss you!
Gildguy or one piece
CHANGE YOUR MIND 😭😭😭😭🤮
I’m going to miss MatPat so much, but he has his own life so I respect his leave.
Nostalgia is high rn
Seeing the old intro made me wanna cry
Please curse on your last episode, we need this 😭
Goodbye Matpat, thank you for making a little theorist myself. Goodbye forever.
I really thought that Gus the Bus wouldn't show up 😂
YESS CLASIC INTRO WOOOOOO
Fnaf better be the last theory
It hurts to see you leave but I will forever cherish the memories we had Mattpat.
I love how the logo is complete. It makes me so happy that its finally finished, but so sad that its one of the last times we will see them.
I can't look at this videos with the same excitement because i just know after 8 more videos you will vanish in the sunset
Classic Intro is so much better.
You we're one of my favorite YouTube and im going to enjoy all the 9 remind video's left 😔

i started watching your videos when i was like 7 Im now 14 and im gonna miss you guys so much i wish you the best ❤
Were gonna miss you Mat thank you for made are childhoods.
Yeah the classic intro is THE BEST
So what you’re saying is that Garten of Banban is the Fast & Furious of mascot horror: It’s dumb, keeps pumping out sequels, and is all about family.
is tom gonna use the same intro?
I hope that since it's the final theories, we finally get that last episode of petscop 🥲
i miss you so much dude but your going so on my bday march

😭
You will always be my childhood matpat
Hearing the classic intro brings back so much nostialga

We need the intro from 11 years ago for the true ogs

You better hope they got permission for inserting Cho-Cho Charles into their game. Otherwise we got thieves.
I think I died of happiness when I saw the intro

CLASSIC INTRO LETS GOOOOOO

7:49 actually, that's Nabnalina. Note the bow. Nabnab isn't there. (Neither is Toadster. 🤷‍♀️)
Please tell me that the your other channels are safe 🙏
Whats will bethe name of the next host of gametheory? Like there is matpat so now TomTom?
I love matpat he is literally my childhood
Just want you to know I did a little dance throughout the entire intro song. My dog is staring at me wondering what's wrong with me.
WHY OF ALL GAMES HE DID FOR HIS FINAL 10 IS THIS ps I will miss you mat😢😢
NOSTAGIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The nostalgia here. Matpat, I hope you could maybe still make a small appearance in videos every once and a while.. I doubt it though.. I hope one day they'll say, "We have a special guest today!!! MatPat!" And that you'll check the comments, still active on YouTube weather you post of no.
Bringing back the old intro made me smile and tear up.
Matpat needs all the rocks.
I'm gonna miss you bro
I was dancing to the audio at the beginning that head is starting to hurt
We love you MatPat!❤️
old intro made me cry!!! :(
Matpat I just realised that this started when I was born
MATT PAT WE WILL MISS YOUUUU IVE ONLY COMMENETED ON LIKE FOUR VIDEOS IN MY LIFE BUT I HAD TO SAY WE WILL MISSS YOUUU
As the count goes down for every video so too will the intro rewind back to the older ones… at least I hope they do it this way

On your last video on Game Theory, you should make the intro the old old original intro.
MATPAT  GOODBYE WE WILL ALWAYS MISS YOU
I thought he quit
His last theory better be about fnaf
Letsss gooooo im here only 4 hours after the upload but i'll miss matpat his hosting and explanation is easy to understand, entertaining and educational

Matpat is the GOAT!
Is it just me, or is starting out the final wave of videos with this just spells one of the sins of our generation? (That game sucks pretty much)
That into thoue
you have 10 videos dont waste them on garten of banban pls
Who els hates UTTP OFFICERS . can they just F OFF
☝️🤓"Umm actually this thumbnail is inaccurate because stinger flynn never got mind controlled in Garten of banban VI"
The internet is exploding with sadness
Classic into, lets gooooo!!!
Before you perish into dust and become anew, please do a Lethal Company theory.
ima miss u so much matpat
I can’t believe one of his last theory’s is Garten of banban
Im gonna miss u bro
Sir mat-pat! Once your break starts I encourage to try baklava! Is a nice flaky Greek treat I would highly recommend
I'm only in this video to enjoy these last theory's made/narrirated by you mat.
Gonna miss matpat, but very much excited for how the others will be the new voices and faces for each respective channel 🤩
imagine if poppy 3 doesn't release before mat leave
I hope there’s one Deltarune theory before MatPat leaves because he did make some interesting theories. That entire rant of him calling out gate keepers really gave me hope that he’d do one more theory for the series.
imma rewatch all matpats vids man…. just to relive it.
0:40 Honestly, I never knew how much I missed the classic intro
Well miss you matpat….
"Ruining your childhood since 2011" 💀
What kart is the fastest? From the intro
Your last vid was your 666th

I started watching GT when I was in 4th grade... I'm graduating highschool next year. Thank you Matpat for making these 8 years of my life (and over thinking video games lol) so enjoyable :)
Boy am I gonna miss matpat... But hearing that intro again felt SO great.

you know matpat nabnan didnt join sir dadadoos rebelion right because if you look at NABNAB you will see NABNAB has an bow tie meaning nabnableena is the one who got mind control not nabnab hope fully this is confirmed
Awesome Job The Game Theorists ! ❤
Game theory will never be the same without mat pat😢
no way this is what he drops after saying he’s gonna quit
I genuinely hope that the petscop theory gets finished within these final matpat episodes, but if not I’ll still cherish all of these final theories. You’ve been doing this longer than I’ve been alive and I appreciate that. I’m happy you get to play games without looking for lore and just to enjoy the game now :)
this intro gives me 10+ years of nostalgia and i love it.
The old intros back again
the way i’ve been sobbing since watching the farewell video is unhealthy 😭🫶🏻 I will miss you matpat
YES GARTEN OF BANBAN!! Gonna miss you matpat actually wild
Yeeaah the classic intro
MatPat looked so mad😂😂😂😂 we will miss you MatPat ❤ :) take care buddy🎉
0:12 🎉🎉🎉 Community reference!!!
Tom is probably the best person to pass the game theory torch off to. Going to miss Matpat though ❤
I’m gonna treasure these last uploads with Mat’s face on the thumbnail. So much. 😊
I'M ON 3:27 OF THE DAY!!!!
nostalgia with the classic intro omg
This is his first of his last nine theories we need more fnaf
Fing garden of banban
It’s sad, because Matt has so much character in his voice, the other staff doesn’t.
Gonna miss u may I’ve watched ur content ever since I was a kid and it was all amazing esp watching ur dang theory’s and other games really gonna miss ya 🥲 (a theory a game theory!!🔥)
matpat you're an actual idiot for quitting ☠, you could've just retired game theory entirely
I'll miss you, MatPat.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YOOOOOOO MATPAT IS BACKKKKKK
your voice is not the same
I love and miss the intros so much and you should use it more often♥️♥️♥️♥️
I miss the classic intro tbh
Yeah. Ban ban is everyones problems these days.
The classic intro hits so much harder than I expected.
It feels weird knowing that this will be permanent 😢
Im not gonna be depressing and mention mat leaving so imma just gonna say. I missed the classic intro its the best.
tom use a voice changer to be matpat please the voice is the channellllll
I miss matpat already, and he is still making videos :<
Matpat we are all going to miss you
Ok not gonna lie. I have missed the classic intro like you would not believe. It absolutely slaps!!! God I'm gonna miss you Mat. Love you!
i cant believe hes leaving ill miss matpat
Ima miss you matpat :(
It's not a theory it's a game theory
9 theories left of trying to get matpat to theorize about geometry dash
i knew you where gonna bring back the opening. so glad you did
I’m going to remain here for as long as all of these channels remain I’m probably going to still be on YouTube even when I’m in my 40s all because mat pat inspired me to even be here on YouTube content may not be the same, but he is my favorite person and forever will be even when he’s not here anymore
I am going to miss MatPat so much man
Goodbye, MatPat. You are an amazing YouTuber, and I will miss you so much.   You have entertained us with your theories for almost as long as I've been alive. That's a big deal, especially when when your channel has become one of the most iconic channels on YouTube.
OML THE CLASSIC OPENING
matpat you never ruined our childhoods you help create them
I'm gonna miss Matt so much man
Gonna miss you MattPatt. We all are.
That ending was unexpected
Going miss u buddy been watching u for awhile
I will miss you! Mat
Can you do a Brawl stars theory before you retire? 😔
That wnding was unexpected
Garden of ban ban looks like what I threw up as a kid  I’m gonna miss you. We all will goodbye.. that’s not a theory
Agreed. Older intros were better.
9 theories remaining until doom😔
We will miss ya Matt, always and forever.
We will miss you matpat, you have been the only channel i have watching when im down. Me and my cousin loves your channel so seing you leave is preety heart breaking. Again, we will miss you matpat
"Bring back the classic intro! "  WHY DID U STOP USING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? 😭
Gonna miss u sm I’m sobbing while watching this
6 remain
Who else missed old intro of game theory
meto
i will refuse to watch any video from game theory that doesn't have matpat, love you matpat 😭
I am gonna miss u mat pat
I'M WATCHING EVERY SECOND
when the old intro played it gave me chills down my spine. im gonna miss matpat
Ill never look at the OG the same way again  (Edited the "OG" back in)
:(
I started watching game theory on a cod ghost video with a friend at a sleepover when I was in middle school I’m now an adult looking into buying my own house it’s sad to see you go but you’ve earned your happy ending
At least he slowly is preparing us while it hurts to know he won't be here. But that's ok we will be ok just like Matpat said just like your grandparents. 🥹💜
mfw i'm watching matpat waste his last videos on these theories that no one cares about.
Please don’t quit
1/9
I’m betting the last video is fnaf
I'm so glad they managed to make some kind of sense out of the new game, I was honestly so hyped when I heard it was out but then on it was diasappointing, I truly believe they could do so much better but for now I'll just be sad to not be able to call myself a banban fan anymore
YOO CLASIC INTRO 2:44 WAIT WHAT CHARLES? i wonder if the two star knows about it (not saying they stole it im just curious)
Is chapter 7 out
😢😢💛💚🩵❤️
I gonna miss matpat I remember is content since 2011 you will be missed.
the fact that Matpat managed to make sense out of those nonsense fever dreams is absolutely insane to me. im gonna miss that level of insanity coming from Matpat.
THE CLASSIC INTRO REMASTER GOES HARD
omg with the og  intro i just got hit with the largest truck by that
YOOO THE INTRO IS BACK
Goodbye matpat..
Noooooo rip matpat                    😞                    🙏
That was one CRAZY theory!!
It would be cool if you mixed all the old intros together on your last video
It's sad that Matt patt won't solve FNAF😢
MATPAT DONT LEAVE US!!!!!
I hope he can still post updates!
Let's see how popular this gets later
Can u at less say happy birthday to me and my sister
No way he does one of his last theories on garten of banban
I had forgotten how much I missed the OG intro. Also, it’s nice that Mat makes jokes about leaving, because it makes the pain lessen.
I'll cry if the last theory isn't a fnaf one
I don’t think I can watch game theory without matpat man
You don't know how happy the original theme song just made me❤
9 remain
I will miss matpat,another legend will miss in yt
Y'all this better be a sick joke
Oh my game Theory the old game theory song 🎶
Me when I saw the beginning on the video 😳
We will miss you
:D
8 more….      :(
The classic intro my god....
Are you still going to appear on the channel still?
the fact that MatPat spent one of his last videos on GARTEN OF BANBAN. I don't believe in earth anymore..
2009 to 2024 im gonna miss ya matpat
Large vehicles seem to hate the mascots
I'm sobbing  I dont want matpat to leave
Ah, this video was worth it just to rock out to the old song again! I forgot how much it absolutely rocked
Pls don’t cute

I've been watching matpat fo 10 years and now he's qutting it's really sad 😭😭😭
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!!!
0:27 thank you 🙏
Im gonna miss you matpat
Watching matpat for one of the final times is so melancholy 🥲
Classic intro😢
It made me cry that he played the original intro. I wish he weren't leaving.
Please game theory I had to watch your YouTube videos for about 4 years by now and I do not want you to go and change your channel to somebody else's okay and I love your videos
We are going to miss Matpat with this one. Going to miss the GOAT
8 more left…
Thanks matpat...for everything.
I will miss you 😢😢😢
Thanks matpat
No no no don't leave please your My childhood
the return of the classic intro was so cool
Gonna miss him 😢
Am i the only one to not see nabnab with the sir dadadoo ? it looks like its nabnalina since it looks like a bow not a party hat. But love the theory <3 will miss you MatPat!
Goodbye.
matpat will be missed by every one the old entry was so cool i remeber it  brings back old meares
Did you know the boss from short war has a channel
That intro is pricles
Getting to see the classic intro with all 4 channels represented is really nice. (especially with the day I've had today)
Please don't leave us matpat everything will never be the same without you!!!!
Gonna miss u
I mean man I’m really going to miss you I like Tom but I prefer you I’ve known you my whole life man I will miss you and what ever you do next let me say I will miss you but even then I hope you have an incredible amount of fun out of the internet I’m going to miss you man
Man I still remember watching these at lunch back in middle school. Really does hurt to see mat go, even if realistically his is as best of terms as it could possibly be.
I don’t see Nabnab in the group of characters that got captured. I only see Nabnalina, unless that’s not a bow that I’m seeing.
17:46 you didn't have to do that 😢
I am so sorry to hear that your leaving 9 more video left 😢
I have depression because of you leaving
Did you know the
There are times where I feel like Matt is giving a game too much credit. This is most of those times.
I saw a vid saying you were dead
MatPat... I just want you to know that whenever I am giving an opinion and the situation fits, I ALWAYS say.... "But heyy thats just an opinion... Myyy opinion..."   And of course I say it like MatPat, well I try at least haha 😂
It really sucks that I want a matpats final series is going to be a garden of ban ban one
Yeah the intro certainly was missed... and MatPat himself will 100% be missed. I hope he comes by every now and then to make few episodes even after "retirement"😊
Byebye matpad
Bro don’t hand it over to Tommy. We need Mathew
I hope his final theory is about fnaf or another bizarre one like sans is ness.
Man Matpat leaving makes me feel old
miss you bro
Matpat you need to have the intro made into a song please
To be honest, i'll try to watch but if it's not matpat, i doubt ill enjoy it. I dont think i'll continue to watch. That being said, i've loved matpat ever since i found him with his frozen 2 video on film theory. I support Matpat and his decision, he will be missed immensly ❤
Ok, I might be a bit under the influence, but i got teary-eyed at the old school intro
HEEEYAWWWW
I miss the classic intro
We going to miss you mat💚 I hope you're doing well and I hope you'll get all of the blessings and love you deserve💛
I missed that intro 😭
Amazing, as always :)
This is exactly how a step down should go, giving the new leads a chance to shine while the old lead gets a few last chances to shine before driving off into the sunset.
Please man, let a few of the last theories be Minecraft so I can lock inside my brain one last memory with matpat yapping about the ancient builders
Hi i am a big fan we will miss you
I’m still in shock that my childhood is leaving love you matpat
Mornin sleepy fellow
los garten of banban is seriously matpats first video before he steps down.
Bro ima miss matpat so much
Adding the old intro literally had me hyped like watching the intro to the last episode of an anime
Yoo that og intro hit different
I’d watch anything in this channel, but I’m kinda sad that one of matpats final videos on this channel is garten of banban, and I hope there isn’t a poppy playtime video
I started watching matpat when he posted the undertale theory’s and I’ve kinda just continued watching him ever since now that he’s retiring I feel like a chapter of my life is complete as I’ve watched almost all his videos and it’s nice knowing I’ve not missed any and that my journey is over Thanks for everything matpat for you’ve held your place in many of us
I have subscribed to you, I have one some strange uncovered lore, and that uncovered lore is non other then GameToons!!
It's wild to know that I was here when the intro first got revealed. I'm going to miss you Matpat! Looking forward to the next few theories, I'm going to cherish each moment with you that I have left!
he will be missed
He back !!!!
The classic intro was such a nolstalgia hit.
Man I missed the classic intro!
Yessss the classic intro
We will miss you bro😢
I MISSED THE OLD INTRO SO MUCH!!! And we'll miss you matpat 😭..
We will miss you matpat. ☹️
Man that intro made me think how much this channel really means to me and to many others I wouldn’t of able to know about bendy,Fnaf lore etc I’m gonna miss him
matpat is so
if one of the final theories is banban im hoping theres at least spot for a QSMP theory, one of the currently popular stories in the internet with a massively convoluted plotline full of misteries and enigmas.
Cool
Rip matpat 🗿
You know you've been watching for a while when the remix is considered the classic intro XD
we will miss you
Its my personal headcannon that the child the MC is looking for is "the perfect child" and the reason we see out of the child's eyes in the dream sequences is cause the child was made using our DNA
Now, normally, i wouldn't click on garten of Ban Ban shet... But for matpat and his last batch of theories? Ill put my hatred for that series aside to watch the last batch of his theories even if it kills me and my brain cells!
Nostalgia~
Lets enjoy the final theories while we can!
Why Tom he can't play trombone
I've never cried emotional tears and laughed comedically during the same video before 💀
I almost can't watch it... i don't know, i feel like I'm in grief :((
Finish fnaf before you abandon us please
Matpat when you pass the channel over you should do it like the doctor who regeneration
2024 already seems like a bad year Matt, pat is handing off his channel. Moo is quitting YouTube.
will you come back
The old intro made me cry
at least the theorists channels are still going
THEE OG INTROOO
Dude, the old game theory intro just hit me so different as of right now. I'm going to miss matpat
If you brought back the intro, is it possible we can see the older ones as there are fewer and fewer theories with you in it?
Man have i missed the classic intro, the nostalgia, omg im gonna miss you matpat, you where my childhood.
Are you gona be there sometimes?
Awhhh bye mattt
We well miss you matpat
man, its been 13 years. we’re gonna miss you matpat.
You can't leeavee!!!! 😢😭😭
When I heard the old intro, it made me cry so much, it brings me back memories. We're all going to miss you Mathew🥲
Stop it Matpat
The old intro give so much memories
The intro was just mmmMmmmMm
Is no one going to point out that banban’s quote is different in the banban V teaser
We will miss you mat. Hope you have a great life. 😊
I hope this is the intro for every game theory to come out
I said it is not taim
OH MY GOD I MISSED THE ORIGINAL INTRO SO MUCH
I love the old intro, we're all gonna miss you Matpat
This is gonna be so sad
Im gonna miss you matpat
The end is important in all things
U were my child hood thanks for making my child hood mat pat u will be missed by all

Despite this being the game I'm least interested in from last year, this was a great theory! Thanks, Matt.
Imagine if the final video Matpat makes is just a cover up for an arg
I will miss you Matpat
Matpat will be missed
Babe wake up, the og game theory intro is back
This is great.
Hey man. I wish you luck.
Dont quit
R.i.p matpat🥹

This entire game is a "The More You Know" moment
I really want them to bring back the intros for each channel, because I miss them.
I go to miss him 😢😢
BRO
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!!!!!
It would be cool each video the intro gets classical and classical
No no no 😿 stop 😢
I cant wait to see tom, its so funny to see tom and matpat interracting.
It's truly sad that MatPat is leaving, but just imagine if Game Theory is gonna be passed down continiously, and in ~100 years it's still up and running (assuming youtube survives that long, probably not)
intro alone gives you a like
That Aint Classic
I forgot how awesome the original intro is
and matpat is the best person on this chanel❤
The clock is ticking, gentlemen.
The one thing that makes me happy is that matpat is just not hosting the theories anymore but he'll still behind the scenes
Can we redo some old theory’s
CLASSIC INTRO YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAA *insert goku scream gif*
I will miss you matpat
lore in a low quality game is amazing also im crying
the fact matpat related a music video made for the game to lore is yes Im back and from the future i think banban 5 will be the end with zolphius as the final boss.
tbh i wanna kms, i need someone to vent. i cant deal with matpat leaving :(
What is this is all a dream it's just a guess 3:42
YEAHHH THE INTRO IS BACKKKKKK
W CLASSIC INTRO IM HYPE
🫡
you have to sing frank sinatra's "my way"
I’m actually gonna cry ❤
Oooh, hearing the old school intro made me tear up a bit. Oooh it hurts my heart.
Matpat is my childhood ❤
i have a theory its pretty weird theory thats like is banban also secretly is syringeon but thats for you to figure out 😉
Please do Marble Hornets, I’m begging hou
IVE MISSED THE INTRO SO MUCH
This is so interesting! I’ve heard this game before. But I didn’t think it was so in depth.
you should totally sing my way by frank sinatra because it fits you perfectly!!!
THE CLASSIC INTRO 😭
Thank you matpattt I love you and your the reason I acc pay attention to life stuff and over analyze stuff I need to

THEY EVEN CHANGED THE BOTS TO SAY AND I QUOTE “I hope matpat never returns” OMFG
Goodbye Matpat I’m gonna miss you man…
Well this was not one of the fan favorites. Everyone hated it cuz it sucked it was cringe
The other day he said that is his last theory 😢😢
Lets give matpat the best year, get him to 20m subs
Man, Frankenstein's zombie characters sure are colorful now adays. From toys to Play-Doh to animatronics. This is really fun to see.
Nooo matpat please don't leave😭😢
I'm gonna miss his voice
Abanban all Hope 😂
“Episode six we deal with all the things I just said.” I’m going to use that for describing the MCU and this movie the main character deals all those words we just used.
we are all gonna miss you you were my childhood  im gonna miss you so much
this guy will be gone like thanos snap
Ima miss him.
0:18 😮 the nostalgia
The old intro was so nice to hear again
I missed that intro... an imma miss matpat..
imagine being a UTTP
Gotta love that classic intro. Probably should have gone all the way back though
Had to remind us with the 9 theories left 😭
Matpat calling that intro the “classic” intro makes me feel old. Like that’s the brand new one!
NO DONT LEAVE
no don't leave matpaT😥😢😭
I’ll be there shortly son 😢
Technically speaking that was nabaleena. On the wall and we don't see nabnab at the end but I'm assuming some bad still happened.  So ya.
I’m gonna miss matpat so much…..
I Will miss him so much dude
Glad to see the og intro.
We will miss you matpat but hey thats not a theory
METAL INTROOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Goodbye...
I am so upset that Mat pat is leaving soon. But I will miss all of his videos and seeing him. I was crying tears so bad. We will all miss u matpat.
I will miss matpat so much, and thank you for 13 years matpat.
Growing up from the early days of your channels life, Ide always watch these videos. They made me really think about the games I would play in a much more different and intriguing way, and in my opinion, really helped me to build up my critical thinking skills. (Maybe not as much as school, but still it helped a lot in those really young years.) I can still remember my favorite classic theory that you did back then with PBG, the classic link is dead theory. (Fun fact, ben drowned gave me nightmares as a kid!)
I need at least one more fnaf theory before you leave.
I'm a fan of matpat and feel sad 😢
Im fine with tom getting the channel just not a stranger
😢
Who th f**k is Tom
If these last few theories are supposed to be MatPat's best and his choice to do it, why did he did he do Garten of Banban
First Scott Now MatPat 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭           By the way is MatPat still gonna be on GTlive
That intro just hits different
Cool theory but can't stop thinking of me missing this angelic voice of mat
I've been crying nonstop 😢
Ill miss this guy alot i wonder if he'll come back 1 day....
This is making me cry
I really miss having intro music in the Theory vids
I'm so happy I get to here the og opening for your last 9 videos  I'm gonna miss you mattpatt I been watching you for 9 years ❤
It dont hit the same
He plays the song in the end
I didn't realize how much I missed this intro ♥
2 of 9 theories left.           Or 10.
watching all his last theories 💔ima miss mat patt
I've never commented, but I did get an idea, what if MatPat tweeted once in a while? Or even like... idk, something similar so that we won't be so upset? Is it a bad idea or did he already think about that?
imma miss matpat. poor man had to make banban vids before he left
7:51 that's not nabnab that's nabnalenna.
Bye Matpat
Matpat you should make a theory about lethal company and it’s lore
i cried during the intro music
Pardon me if I’m being an idiot here but Who’s Tom?
Yes the classic intro lets gooo!
Classic intro ALL THE WAY baby. It just hits harder
Seeing the old intro back with the blue and yellow of the two new channels just brings me the biggest smile in the world!!!
I’m have missed you it gt intro!
8 more theories left 🙁
I swear these bots in the replys of comments i think i know what makes then tick “im gonna miss matpat”
Dude, that intro is such a big nostalgia hit for my brain.
We all are gonna miss matpat, no video is the same without him
Bringing back the old intro was icing on the cake. Gonna miss you MatPat
hehe.. I’m not crying.. 😢 9 more..?
For real dude i will miss you so much idk what to watch

- 9 Theories Remain. -
CLASSIC INTRO!!!
OH MY GOD ITS BACK
im goona miss you matpat
1/9 theories to go
I hope that when Matt Patt leaves, he will still do some videos every once in a while 🥲
We'll miss you Matpat...🥺😭🫡
The classic intro brings so many memories back
Thank you MatPat for being the best theorist ever on YouTube, and  helping use having great childhoods 🥲🫡
Bro made me cry by bringing back the classic intro
I’m going to miss Matpat so much but I’m so excited to see what everyone else will do with the new theories. We love you Matpat!
I've watched Game Theory from the very beginning...and I've missed the OG GT intro music (and its variants) so much! I'm gonna miss Matthew and Steph so much (already missing Steph since she's not really on GTLive anymore, only making some visits here and there). It's gonna be tough when it's the same with MatPat 😢 BUT I support him and Steph in their decision and understand why, and I look forward to watching Tom and the rest of the creative directors/soon-to-be new hosts' vids. Long live theories!💚💚
HE BROUGHT BACK THE INTRO THANK YOU FINALLY
Mat say's lets play the classic intro *Doesn't play classic intro but the newer revamped version* For shame Matpat For shame, but for real gonna miss you as the host man. Been watching GT since the early days Thank you for the entertainment over the years.
im gonna miss you matpat
LETS GET MAT PAT TO 20 MILLION BEFORE HE GOES
It won’t be the same soon
this is hard
Couldn’t you just do monthly uploads instead… please don’t leave us
I felt a wave of nostalgia from the intro
Can’t believe Garten of Banban is in gonna be permanently engrained in Matpat history as one of his final 10 theories😭😭
Yeaaahhh classic intro 🤟🏿🤟🏿🤟🏿
Oh no the uttp are harrassing matpat now
Mat, promise me you will at least make your guest appearances every now and again, I can’t say forever goodbye, I just can’t.
77
Let's hope Tom carries on Matt's Legacy
I’ll miss you MatPat
Respect
im so glad banban made it
I'll miss your content 😭😭😭😭😭😭
“Stinger decides to capture a rescued Banban” Matpat 2024
The YouTube community will miss you so much Matpat 🩵

Im gonna miss you matpat
Old intro is class cheer bro
U know how friends come over to events like new year? Well should there be something similar with matpat doing fnaf movie theories once the movies come out? (That's a special occasion thing, and it's only an option)
9

Nine theories left.  >Save?

All of these bots are bothering me 😑
I hate that it’s here but I’m so happy it’s here

whats going on with the bots in this comment section jeez
Many mixed emotions.....
F* ck yeay its  the  intro.
Amazing theory as always, we're going to miss you matpat.
This is all we have left of Matpat.   And it's Garten. Of. Banban.
Oh god we're even doing the old intro, its both nostalgic and sad but it's also a bit exciting too see how these last few theories with Matpat go out
13 years of driving through the path of content creation, and all the roads lead to banban
Is matpat gonna be showing rarely in videos as a guest after the 10 theory episodes
Goodbye matpat
I thought he said he was bringing back the classic intro.
I will miss matpat, but i am also excited for Tom.
MatPat deserves the vacation. I'm gonna miss you
I am gonna de sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo SADD when he leaves
I missed the classic intro
cant belive that  there are only 9 theorys left i will miss him soo much thank you mat pat for everthing😭😮‍💨
He'll be missed by everyone
final 9 to go 🥲
TOM
It’s slowly coming to an end
Why gart for bnam
I really feel like you acknowledged my comment in the retirement warning video.
the intro song hits way to hard.
/staybackmat
tcoaal theory when!?!??!
MatPat was my childhood me and my dad would watch all of his new videos I don’t know if I’m going to be able to live with myself after he’s gone.
I won’t miss this slop Ngl absolute cash grab
Noo matpat please don't leave
It’s not gonna be the same after mat-pat
THE INTROOOOOOO9
Uh
Matpa is my childhood
I'm soo glad that matpat can make a thoery about poppy playtime chapter 3 before he retires:)
Garten of banban making new games as fast as matpat drinks diet cokes
these last few theorys i thought were gonna be more homage to matpat. More heartfelt It just seems like its just any other theory
Game theory ruining your childhood since 2011
That intro! ❤
why theory for a game that is terrible for the last 10 theories
Can u do a theory about bendy the cage or bendy the movie?
We will all miss your theories so much Mat, Thanks for a wonderful childhood!
plz do some more classic videos instead of just the normal series plz. if these are gunna be your last make em memorable
The guitar riff of the intro at the end was very appreciated matpat and the team. Thank you
will you come back for poppy 3
The classic intro!!!!!!!
YES THE INTRO IS BACK BABYYYYYY
Seeing theories from matpat isn’t the same
Matpat thank you for being my childhood and being there into some of my teeen years. We all will miss you so much man❤️
Finnaly the og intro
I'm excited to see what Tom has in store.
Thank you for all the fun over the years, we'll all miss you Matthew Patthew
Matpat.  seriously? Banban.?
don’t feed the muse in 5 minutes
i hope the new person thats gonna take over doesnt try to be matpat  and just do a twist into the videos
IF THESE UTTP THINGS REPLY TO THIS (I’m gonna do somthin bad or smth) p.s. (I’m gonna miss matpat so much 😭)
Do lethal company
I’m going to miss mat pat
Nice community reference
I know we all are going to miss matpat but can you make one you your last videos on the memory’s you made
Mat, we want the real intro...Gaming Tangental Theory!!!!and Mat Pat's Final Tought!!!
matpat is real
Uttp deserved no rescept after spamming in matpats comments
:’( 9 videos left
Whoever is gonna run this has some BIG shoes to fill in im gonna miss matpat we love you so much and will miss you ❤
17:42 / 18:05
It’s the final countdown                      Episodes
hey wanna have a conversation
I hope matpat still appers in other videos
"ABANBANDON ALL HOPE!"
THE INTRO IS BACK I'm crying actually sobbing
😮 flashbacks
UTTP wya
Miss you matpat...
Pls tot koł pls pls
😂 the very last second of the ending got me 18:02
Nice matpat, nice.
We will all miss you matpat you always brought joy into my day
Just wanna point out, any one take notice that matpats goodbye video was his 666th video     Personally i think its crazy coincidence
I don’t think I’ve ever heard MatPat swear before, censored or otherwise, I guess retiring means all cards are off the table
My friend almost killed himself that’s how much he loves your content. He didn’t go through it though and do it, matpat your fans will miss you
Imagine if Matpat quitting was just a theory and he acts like it’s normal and he’s still doing theories.
Getting hit with the old intro felt so AWESOME!! That being said, I genuinely can't believe a coherent story was even possible with Garten of Banban. I'm kinda hoping the bros take some notes from this if it wasn't their original direction. Great theory for our final 9!
Matthew whyyyyyyyyyyyy                            Is that his name i just guessed it cause i forgot if he said his name
WE WILL MISS YOUU ALSO OG INTRO
That classic intro gave me chills
I hope Mattpat pops up in a theorie every once in a while as a guest
I still think that Stinger Flynn having the parent, the protagonist of the game, take the blame isn't really fair. Especially since the current events involving the naughty ones and the events prior to that will happen regardless if the parent came or not. Besides, they only want their child, or children, back.
Garten of BanBan is a *”Love Story”* a fall, friends, foes, freedom, etc *(DONT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY)*
The older intro is definitely better than the current one
Keep the OG intro for whenever Mattpat appears in a video after he’s gone.
1/9😕
Hadn’t realised how much I missed the intro but I nearly tryeds crying when I heard it 😭
We will finish the FNAF lore for you.
Thank you matpat for being there when i didnt understood fnaf lore IM GOING TO MISS YOU!!!! BIGGG LOVEEEEE MATTPATT ❤❤
This is probably wrong....but i had a thought. What if at some point in the game, we switch from the character that started (aka the parent) to the child.   "This all happened because of you" its been said. This is all happening because your mother is searching for you, shes ripping through rooms and floors. She's destroying the facility all for you. Maybe thats why the character play seems is so short.
I’m gonna miss Malay bro just love how we get the classically intro
The intro!!!
Man does it hurt
NO HES WASTING ONE ON BAN BAN
THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!! WOOOOOOOO
Hey it's my birthday and I can't think of a better gift from YouTube than your video Imma miss you MatPat
The way I subconsiously hummed 0:26
Oh, seeing the intro is so bittersweet :')
The classic intro made me remember back when I was 11 and watching the first of Mat’s many FNAF theories. I am going to miss Mat so much. Thank you for all the memories Mat Pat!!! ❤❤❤❤
Seeing and hearing the classic intro made matpat leaving really sink in.
Oh my God its the classic
It hurts 😢 to watch the OG intro , u will be missed
The intro unlocked some hidden memories
Him talking about the dreams reminded me of something you can find a note somewhere in choo choo Charles about a bus that similar to choo choo Charles somewhere on the mainland
I’m gonna miss mat pat man

😌classic intro  Gotta love it ❤

I can’t watch this without feeling slightly sad
a legend that will not be forgotten in history
the beginning of the end
I teared up hearing the classic intro... Thanks for the memories, MatPat.
Its like the og blues clues all over again. Steve going off to College and being left with... 'Joe' Joe's a nobody. Steve was superior Friend. And its gonna be the same here. MattPat will be face superior theorist on game theory
MATPAT, PLS DO SOME CAMEOS ONCE IN A WHILE😊

MatPat, you need to swear in your final theory!
YESSSS THE OLD INTRO!!!! 💕💕💕 nothing gets me more hyped
we need the og intro on last episode
MatPat you have done everything for me to make me happy, and no other youtuber like you has done a lot of things to entertain me. I will miss you forever. When i heard the news i was crying the entire day when it was posted. You...are...special...to...me. goodbye.
Didn’t u quit
Love seeing the older intro in his final theories it’s going to be a great send off I feel. 🎉
I love that intro
As much as I’m going to miss MatPat, I want to wish him and the new voice of GameTheory the best of luck
Dude you have to make another gta 6 theory
Pain
Comon
That classic intro is the GT national anthem
I still wonder about that one weird ghost encounter in Chapter 6.
THEORY If you have watched Martyn’s aka inthelittlewood’s 3rd, last, or limited POV than you know the watch talk in riddles to him and a phrase that is repeated constantly by the watchers is our will be done and what if the watcher’s will is to defeat and remove Grian from the series due to the watchers mentioning that he shouldn’t there
Of all things
Hey matpat just wanted to say that we all love you and thank you for all the years you have been here with us, i found something cool tho, in the bontergeist episode from martin walls, there was a release date at the end 01-31-2024 which we all think its twf4 release date, i think we all would love it if u reacted to it before you left but if u cant thats fine.
We will miss you Mat  things won't be the same😞
We need to give this man a salute for a over a decade of childhood 😢 🫡
It isn’t a theory… it’s and end
Least we get 9 left right?
I really missed that intro
Mat pat will always be in the top 20 best yt for me❤
The classic intro... such nostalgia...
Please make the final petscop theory its been four years
Do a tower hero’s theroy or shorts wars season 3 Edit: I mean 2
I hope mstpat does theories on tmnt
I never knew how much i missed the classic issue 😭
Remember that's just a theory, A GAME THEORY!
One of the last best  theories that got hyped up was wasted on garten
9 theorys until the party...
9 is down 8 remain. I'm not ready
The last cameo Garten of BanBan needs is with fortnite lol
I'm not gonna lie, I cried when I saw the classic intro. I'm really gonna miss MatPat 😭
Another video that I can't stop crying, thank you for everything MatPat
Just seeing the number, drop of theory left… that is the true jump scare we made along the way
It’s not the same without u tho
Gonna miss this guy
Gonna miss your extra pop when emphasizing these crazy games.
MAT PAT PLS DO ANOTHER POKÉMON THEORY BEFORE YOU GO
I’m gonna need some coffee after this
W classic intro I have been watching you for 5 years now... I am 11 that means dang you have almost been half of my half
i could not stop crying throughout this whole video but not like sad tears more like happy tears
We love your videos MatPat you will be missed ❤
I will never forget, “BUT THATS JUST A THEORY”
It’s not the same without you
I mean I like Tom but he's not matpat:( EDIT:here UR NOT COVERING POPPY PLAYTIME?
seeing all four Theory lights turn on in the colors of the four channels during the intro made me feel significantly more completed as a person
Stinger flinn is eren Jager
ngl i teared up during the intro
There's no way Scott stays silent on the retirement of one third of the FNAF Triforce.
it’s kind of funny how one of matpats last videos is about banban
Dang Rocket Music got a shot out!
Bad month for YouTube, Tom Scott and MatPat have quit, and lynja died as well
ok i know matpat is leaving but a garten of banban theory??? seriously???
Dude seeing that intro in an actual new episode is beautiful 🥲
I legit teared up seeing the intro and replayed it 6 times
:,( you... were the one of the biggest inspirations to me
That intro is euphoric, im gonna miss you matt
FINALLY!!! HE BROUGHT BACK THE INTRO!!
I'm going to miss you man 🥺
clasic intro!
Matpat will always be remembers as a legend
I love the classic intro
goodbye, mat... you made a whole family, we're gonna miss you, thank you.
im gonna miss matpat so so so so so so so so so much
Oh boy, that classic intro brought back a wave of nostalgia. Goodbye Matpat! Thank you for uploading amazing content for 13 years!
Tell US why im crying because you're retiring
How can you event take the game series seriously anymore?
We will miss you mat 😢
It’ll never be the same without hearing the “welcome to game theory” and “but that’s just a game Theory.” Without his voice 💔
I have tons of games i can make theries of so if you want, you can pick me!🥹 Please, it would be sad if it wasn't me who got picked. If you are giving away your channel I guess.
The classic into, and mat's voice made me legit cry
I miss the classic😢
That intro,i love it,thank you so much matpat
I feel like a lost apart of myself, we’re gonna miss you mat
thank you for making another banban theory!!!!!!
Gotta be Fr that old intro almost made me cry
A simple but dumb idea might be to change the slogan from “ruining your childhood” to “creating your childhood”
bro who got you smiling like that *the intro*
The classic into gave me chills.  Enjoy retirement MatPat, you gave us more than we could have ever deserved.
Amazing theory
Im gonna miss matpat so much dude. Im probably only going to rewatch old videos after he quits as it just wont hit the same anymore.
I hope he finishes petscope before he's gone.
That classic intro brings back memories 😢😢
BROTHERS WE NEED TO STAY STRONG WE ALL LOVE HIM
Eldenring  theory?🤨
Ah, I’m glad you’re doing intros again, but I wish it was the true classic intro from over half a decade ago
We will miss you matpat  :(
3 hours and its so nice to see the original intro again 🎉
I remember you from 14 years ago
Dude im not going to look at matpat posting theory's the same way knowing its a count down
not only do i say this for myself but for most of your community but we will miss you.
I well miss you
Met a great person, and it said it seems signing off, but that doesn’t mean our favorite theories are gone. That doesn’t mean the channel is done that just means there’s gonna be a new face of the channel.
Not tryna hate but I think the channel will die after MatPat leaves
Last one is 100% a fnaf theory
it’s just sad seeing all you memories going away
Are you going to make some cameos and come to the town a little bit sometime?
The old intro is FOR THE OG’s
Gonna miss MatPat so much bro 😭
8 remaining
I watched you from the very beginning and i am still here in the very end i will miss you.
i am gonna miss you  thank you for what you did
Your giving me heart attacks man! 😭
One reason I started watching game theory was case of his voice
I missed Loooooooooore!
We will not forget about you matpat

Matpats the goat for bringing the old intro back
CLASSIC INTRO, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Didn't...didn't this get posted yesterday??? Why does it say three hours ago?? Matpat why have you forsaken my YouTube???  Edit: Never mind I was looking at the wrong channel 😅
Seeing all the segments of the classic intro logo gives me such a mix of nostalgia, pride and completion Gonna miss you Mat
Matpat when I become a YouTuber I will be a theorist my name will be Mario ENA(Enchanted Netherite Armor).
Matt it’s been fun having you as the host. No one can fill your shoes. They can try, but it’ll not be the same.
That was nabbelnella
Matpat you need to do a theory about clover by @OR3O_xd it’s a series of songs with lore
This was one of the last videos he decided to make 🤓
I will miss you can you please say hi wen Tom gets the channel
We are gonna mis you mat pat 9 more theory’s remaining. We love you mat pat
I must say that as much as im going to miss Matt I'm also really excited for what Tom will bring

Can you pleas do a theory on the glyphs in Assassin's Creed 2 before you handel the chanel to Tom
7:52  nabnab didn't get mind controlled. he escaped hence we didn't see him at the end of the chapter
But hay that's just a theory, A GAME THEORY!! Thanks for entertaining
9 theorys remain...  We will miss you matpat :(
That intro
Honestly, I've been watching this channel for years. I started watching this channel in the 5th grade, and I am now a sophomore in college. I am excited to see Tom take the reins on this channel. In all my years of watching, I have almost never commented. However, I feel the need to express my deep appreciation to Matpat for his content and, even more so, his personality. I will not forget Steph; she is the reason any of us can still watch, and your banter will not be forgotten. I say this purely platonically; I love you guys and wish the best for you! Thank you for all your theories. I will miss you and never forget you guys... Goodbye.
CAN YOU PLEASE DO A RED DEAD REDEMPTION 1 OR 2 THEORY
just imagine: its march 9th and you open youtube just to see matpats last video with scot cawhton with him in the thumbnail...
Matpat the iconic fnaf theories,i gonna miss you man
The best intro
YAY MATPAT IS BACK or..... is he
Matthew why did you waste one of the last 9 on Banban
Gonna miss you MatPat
the voice acting in this game is so bad that it made me start practicing the voices for my own game while MatPat was talking.
Ok, but did it have to Garten of BanBan?
i almost cried seeing the old intro it normally wouldn't but knowing that ur leaving soon it hits different
This man is leaving game theory but yet he hasn't done a theory on call of duty
If the last theory isnt a fnaf theory the world shall riot
I said out loud I hope Mattpat plays the original intro 🥹
We will all miss you MatPat
I’m pretty sure he should remixed the original intro
We'll all miss you Matpat. Also, I love the classic intro. It is, in my opinion, one of the best GT intos ever.
Wait hold on when he says nine theory’s does he mean 9 seperate theory’s or 9 more weeks of all 4 theory vids per week
Missed the classic intro
Not me crying instantly after seeing the old intro
0:08  lol
seeing the old intro with all colors on the logo made me cry... matpat has come so far.
Mattttt!!!😄😄😄
Watch me be wrong but i wanna call it now; this will somehow *(im betting audio)* start the arg he was talking about
gonna miss seeing mat host, but i have hope for the future
Noooooooo not the 9th
Now i want a banbananan
Pls dont leave. Say it was a joke pls pls pls pls
AHHHH ILL MISSS YOU MATT 💜
9 theories remaining 😭
i miss this intro so much so many memories
I don't even like garten of banban I'm just watching this - I cried so much with the classic intro
That classic intro is my whole life man
I wish you never leave😢
YouTube won’t be the same without mat pat
16:52 it’s all about family
Tbh I’m glad we get to see these last theories instead of him just leaving Your the goat matpat 🐐
0:21 OH MY. Never in my life have I thought about seeing this classic in 2024 again! We are going to miss you, MatPat. 🙂
Will the last be fnaf
I'm going to miss matpat but I hope when Tom does take over he won't get too much hate for being the new game theorist, he seems like a cool dude.
Let's go the classic intro is back  I'm so glad you brought it back. I'm gonna miss you so much Matpat
To quote Sheldon: who's with the happiest 600 hours of my childhood
Imma be so sad on the last theory maaaaan 😢😢😢😢

Classic intro for the win!
I'm going to miss matpat so much this channel was my entire childhood

9 remains...make it count
Hi
UPDATED CLASSIC it now has all 4 channels
I feel like this was a perfect 9th last episode!
I’m gonna cry
I hope the last video has the original intro
The classic intro is sending me 🙏🙏
Yo the og intro
i missed the og intro 🥹
Being completely honest, you should’ve kept in the old ones and just coloring your Logan to different things that that theme song goes so hard
Also where is petscop theory?
no dont go 😭
please end them in "Aaaaaand cut" it brings so much more nostalgia
I feel like I owe you Matpat,I'll miss you forever...if you come back just dont forget to read this,I'll keep you in my heart...  -Cheese
W theories as always
KEEP THE INTRO AFTER MATPAT LEAVES! PLEASE!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
WE LOVE YOU MATPAT 🏆🏆🏆💚💚💚
We could also be the parents child
Do you really have to retire completely? I mean, I wouldn't mind if you JUST did the fnaf theories, or if you came back once in every 10 or so theories. You're basically the teacher of our internet generation, it's gonna be sad to watch you go
Hearing the intro just crushed me. I'm going to miss you mat
Im gonna miss you ;_;
9th... This is sad man the nostalgics are kicking in...
I'll miss him
Maaan, the classic intro hits so different now… :( We’ll all miss you, MatPat! ❤
Look at the views vs likes real weird
I was thinking, maybe the bus and choo choo charles are related. Could the busses represent gus the bus?
Ima miss you❤
Yes the OG stuff I love it legend
I went so crazy, when I heard the old intro.🤟
Matpat leaving makes me wanna rip my self into pieces but the old intro music man
BUT HEY THATS NOT JUST A THEORY ANYMORE A FACT
1 down 8 more to go.

I'm gonna really really miss you matpat. You'll never be forget... 😢

I have a theory what if the imposters are actually aliens, trying to take revenge for their planet in among us
the countdown has started - 9 left
the classic intro brought me back ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
*8 theories until the party.*
No Matpat I want you to stay
Garden of banban does not deserve yours theories
I cried when the classic intro started playing. I’ll miss you matpat
It’s so sad that you are leaving but at least you don’t have to deal with this gobb anymore
i hope matpat uses more of the old intros before hes gone. i need closure.
I love how nobody actually comments about the theory but more about how mucb they'll miss matpat (i'll miss you matpat)
Bro the old intro
Yay mat pat quit YouTube 🎉🎉
I've never been so dreadful of a YouTuber uploading. We will miss you MatPat.
I am not crying you are!!!
I WILL MISS YOU BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING A GOB THEORY
I can’t believe that Matpat is going away
I am going to cry
Sir Dadadoo didn't have Nabnab, he had Nabnaleena. The glowing bow is just like Banbaleena's
when one of ur favorite songs is apart of ban ban lore 🙃
What if the child they used for solphius was ur own child...
Cmon Man dont go
Hello
I love how now MatPat is making jokes about him stepping down. It shows he’s confident in Tom and the rest of the crew and is trying to make things more lighthearted. Thanks MatPat
we love you matpat.
Arigato Matto Patto
That intro LETS GOOOOO. I’m gonna miss you dude :(
I’m crying dude. I couldn’t take the intro.
Classic intro still hits hard
God, I am really going to miss Mat Pat ALOT.
we will all miss you matpat
The game theory into music has never hit so hard.
Seeing the classic intro almost made me cry… we will miss you Matpat
Did anyone think of aot when he said stinger flinn wants freedom💀
I'm gonna miss you man
Bye matpat... Were gonna miss you legendary soldier 🫡🫡.      9
I would sell my organs to you for you to not leave also the only one that is not withthe naughty ones is nabnab and probably banban
Bros these bots are so annoying
I WILL CRY SO HARD
I love how he brought back the classic intro to commemorate his last few weeks on the channel
Press r to pay respects
The very last theory has got to be fnaf
Man, im gonna miss you,        Please pin me ive never been pinned before
Man, Tom's got a big set of shoes to fill
why is brainrot the last 9
Were gonna miss you bro
These newer theories like fnaf aint been it so glad ur retiring
Yes
i just got bombarded with nostalgia
im gonna miss matpat so so so much
...Goodbye
When I move out of my house I will be a big vr youtuber and gaming youtuber to avenge matpat
My worst nightmare is matpat Not being the one who speaks
Why does that old nostalgic intro sound like the best song ever now
Only 8 left… NOOOOOOOOOOOO
The nostalgia from the old intro hit me harder than a speeding train😭
I'll miss you matpat
Every one like all of matpat's last 10 videos
Will we ever see you again matpat?
I'm going to miss matpat.
seeing the classic intro back gave me chills, I played only the first GOB (garten of banban) mainly because i didnt wanna buy the other ones so a mainly watched your playthoughs I cracked up so hard at the choo choo charles part. im going to miss ya man.
Did he do this this as his last theory? Right before quiting. He had to chose garden of banban?
The 9 theories reaming card made me want to cry
:(
Matpat, I love you stay
😔
Goodbye mat  Ik that new hosts will amazing but its not gonna be the same
Bro the explosion at the end 😂. Tanks Mat for your cool videos 😊
I was like YES YES YES when he said old intro, but it wasnt the real old one
BanBan made it to the last theories. Let's see what's next
Classic intro made me tear up 😭
God I miss the original intro
The countdown has begun, i will miss you mat
No im gonna cry with these videos and with his original theme omgg 😢
Me when annoying officers raid the comment section cuz they think they’re hilarious:
We can all agree we'll miss matpat
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO MY YOUTH😊
Why are u wasting a theory on garden of banban ☠️☠️
I hope matpat makes a episode about plants vs zombies, i know that game has lore to uncover
Matpat I love you!
I will miss u matpat
you've been apart of my life since i was about 6. i'm 18 now- and it's so sad to see you go Matt... you've been with me through the best and worst parts so far! you've help shape me into this person i am now. and it's almost ironic i feel... almost idk... i'm an adult now and you're moving on. kinda funny, i will always appreciate the memories and help you've given me as i grow. thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. may you find true happiness in what you continue with your life and know i'm staying around here. gotta see where it goes- i owe that much.
I will cherish every single one of these 9 last theories
Wow, I forgot how much I liked his old intro.
That classic intro shot so much adrenaline into my veins, it's insane. We'll miss ya, MatPat
Im gonna cry bruh😭
Why does it say ruining your childhood since 2011 you were my childhood💀
You made my day watching these theories thank you😭😭😭😭🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
I missed the classical intro
I will miss you so much mat.....
Hearing that intro gives me chills
oh also one question - will matpat just move somewhere with his family and never return to the game theory *or* will he still be in the studio but he won't voice the game theory videos anymore  i really can't tell, cause he said he would do that *and* that
Neiche reference, but I find it really funny that the text to speech bot that the jellyfish uses is the same from a youtube series called If The Emperor Had a TTS, random but i thought it was funny
You will be in are harts for ever😢
The classic intro!!!
Feels like I’m watching a viking funeral. 🏹🔥⛵️
I started crying when they put the intro on
why couldn't the last theroy be fnaf :(
The into made me smile, I'm gonna miss you matpat
YES CLASSIC INTRO LESGOOOOOOOO
im gonna cry
nah, we need the REAL classic intro
I have some hope that Mat will come back eventually since he’s still working on the videos but not hosting them so maybe he’ll come back after he isn’t burnt out anymore and only when he’s ready so maybe after a few years he can gradually come back with a less grinding upload schedule (maybe keep the new hosts but every week Mat hosts one on them so one week he hosts game theory the next film theory and so on)
7:51 that’s nabnaleena
WAIT WHAT? NO NO NO.. BRO I'LL MISS YOU SM
The intro..AHHHHEHSHDHSUS😭 Game theory...
The original intro just slaps SO hard, I can already tell these final theories are gonna be amazing.. even if one of them is Banban.
The intro 😭😭
NO I CRIED HEARING THE CLASSIC INTRO😭 MATPAT IM GONNA MISS YOUUUUUU
We willl miss you mate Mat
THE INTRO
Thank you so much for including the classic intro.  I've missed it so much.
I’m really gonna miss Matpat 😭
I teared at the intro I swear this guy has the power to do things, I don know what, but things
Hey at least we the series is being handed over to someone that we trust, Tom!
Couldn’t have been explained better!
Surprised, you pull out this video before the second part of Chapter 6 gameplay. DONT RUN FROM IT! Also, i love this theory!
First 15 seconds and I'm alredy crying
Yes the classic intro that I grew up with
I hope you can come back to YouTube one day most of my childhood memories are made around your channel
I just realised the reason it didnt feel the same watching your vids was because of the intro :/
THE INTO IS BACK                                                        LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Matpat I'll miss you a lot, you've entertained my difficult life I've had so much. You're remembered from me ❤
I'm gonna miss Mat, but if he picked Tom to replace him I trust him.
The first theory of the end is garten or ban ban  What timeline is this?!!?!?
Bro that OG intro
you should do one on super normal before you leave
The classic intro !!
9
Don’t leave ever
ow. my nostalgia
Can we keep the old intro forever
THE OG INTRO! Man will I miss this
Dude….. I'll miss you MatPat... You were always there for me in the past 10 years... During my lowest lows you still made videos that kept me entertained and took my mind off of my life's problems... If you are reading this, thank you for everything, I'm serious. I balled my eyes out at your announcement. You are the only creator that truly made me cry...
Goodbye matpat
I’m hoping so much even tho he’s stepping down he pops in now and then like or like every year he’s a host of a video or sum
Do I have the right to cry 😢
Garten of Peak.
Im gonna miss you so fricking much man
bye bye matpat
Wow the classic intro, that really took me back lol 😭
pat
One of the final 9 being banban is criminal
I was expecting the old OLD intro.
All of your fans gonna miss you bro I going to miss you
The last video of the channel 😢
5:22 Flynn said that he could somehow use the children by “ practicing the safest of procedures ” likely meaning that the kids knew the way out. And we can even GUESS that they know the way to the beach. Because you can dream of places you’ve already been to.
Shed a tear at hearing the classic intro
You can’t start a video reminding us how much we’ll miss you
I think each theory should have of the old intros ( if they have one)
His last episode should have the original intro
First, gonna miss you matpat, second I always see him post videos every 1 or 2 weeks, now hes posting every 2-3 day
8 theories remain😢
The OG Intro is Making me cry
So we have 8 video left mat leave channel
the LOOOOOOOOOOOORE!!!!!!! aint gonna be the same with out him=(
In classic "Link is dead" fashion, 9 theories remain
Yay but was he joking
I actually don’t care about garden of BamBam. I’m just watching it because I’m going to miss Matt Pat.😢
The classic intro 😭
The memories, its killing me😢❤❤
9 theory’s remaining…
hey matpat could you do a theory about the maze runner and see if it really is possible to make a griever before you... you know.... leave...
I think it would be cool for MatPat to add a new channel, where he goes through different theories and talks about if he likes them or not and if he thinks they are correct or not
That game play was hard to watch 😂.
There's no way we'll ever forget MatPat... 😢😢😢
that classic intro hits different
I really missed the intro, it brings back memories of when my older sibling introduced me to Game Theory. Im gonna miss those times, but im excited to see what Tom is gonna cook up!
Man don’t quit I wanted you to take up the Walten files 4😢
Seeing a garten of banban theory right after MatPat announced he was quitting is one of the most wild things I’ve ever seen.
Thank you matpat we will truely miss you
8 of 10
the classic intro hits  soo hard
Sorry Tom but as the next game theory host taking up the mantle you’re gonna have to deal with the pain and suffering that comes with it
MATPAT IS BETTER THAN UTTP
Classic intro hit me hard
God I'm gonna miss him
9 weeks until this channel enters starts a permanent decline and eventually everyone at Team Theorist loses their jobs. 🤷 Only speaking the truth. I do wonder if MatPat will pull the Uno Reverse card when he sees how terrible the view counts become after he leaves, but it wouldn't surprise me to see him just watch it slowly burn away now that he's already sold the company for millions to Lunar Entertainment.
We will all miss you man❤
The best into!!!
Yay new video before  end of this chanel
Man… that intro.
I did not expect the OG intro, great theory as well
a few years from now, we'll all cry rewatching this man in the fnaf movie
I just wanted to say that since you've announced you're leaving and I've seen more love and positivity being given to YouTubers than I think I ever have. Just want you to know that, even in leaving, you are making such a positive impact.
Honored to be here to catch all these theories. I’ll make sure to check watch each one of these past theories. Salute to MatPat!
someone get those bots off the comment section
I can't handle this dude.
Let's appreciate these last few uploads from MatPat before he goes.
Goodbye matpat we will miss u
we will miss you so much matpat ❤
Sucks to see the comments being spammed by some losers. Love you so much mat, hope to see you do some episodes every once in a while still, sorta like some of the other creators that showed up for their own little mini series on the channel. Even if we rarely see you, love you and hope whatever you do next is great <3
THE CLASSIC INTRO BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES 💔
Hey mat pat i dont know if you will get this comment but i think you should go back to happy meat farms for one of your last nine episodes.
DEAR MATPAT i want you to read this comment and know my appriciation to you and what youve done for me and my whole comminity somthing i think is the best thing that you have somhow managed to do is keep me interested in your last  video you mentiond how all these youtubers are quiting, almoast every youtuber that you mentiond in that video has lost me completely but you raised me from your second fnaf video tell now and i think that is impressive because youve kept it interested in such a way to that i watch every new video because i know its gonna keep in engauged for 15 plus muinites i cant name another thing that does that for me and matpat i swear if you are quitting to create lore about yourself then i will figure it out *sorry my spelling sucks i really hope you read this and thank you so much.
if tom dose have the channel we will love you like we do matpat❤
Stoppp this is giving me nostalgic vibes.
this guy was my childhood dude
YOOOO THE OG INTRO
NO DONT WASTE ONE OF MATPATS FINAL 20 ON FREAKING GARTEN OF BANBAN
THE CLASSIC INTRO OANAMAGMGOGNTGKGNA NOSTALGIA GO BRRR
Excited to see Tom doing the theories, but I will miss matpat
I’m utterly terrified that the Garden of Banban is going to be Tom’s FNAF 😂
How did he not cry at all during this video?
don't leva us plz
Nooooooo.... The classic intro nearly made me tear up T_T
No I don’t leave l you are my favorite Youtubers since I was 4 now I am 9
The old intro was amazing
the classic intro gave me chills
I never thought that the first of MatPat's final episodes would of been about Garten Of BanBan, not gonna lie. I'm gonna miss you MatPat.
I want my childhood to be ruined by MatPat not Tom. WHOSE WITH ME 👇👇👇👇👇
Why waste what little is left on ban ban
Noo the nostalgic intro as well :(
Noooooooo I'm missing mat pat bro pleas come back
When he leaves, my childhood will end
I have missed the classic intro
YAY CLASSIC INTRO
No man do welcome hoooome
great vido matpat your amazing it wont be the same without you i had a dream that my family met you dk why
This was one of your final game theories an 18 minute episode. Are you kidding me?
i dont want matpat to go
THE ORIGINAL INTROOOOOO
Please don’t quit
I was literally crying because of you leaving.
MatPat, your a great man and I’m gonna miss you bro. ❤❤❤
Things will never be the same, but, nothing lasts forever.
I cried 😭😭
"A gaaaaame theory" this would never be the same after 9 weeks
For your finals theory you have to do one last finale fnaf timeline lol.
Love that they used the new channel colours in the old intro
Trying not to get bot replied challenge (impossible)
That classic intro was so nice to see again .
It could be funny if they will keep the mat png, and use ai to mimic mat pat voice
MatPat you just dragged me back into my past and I love it. We're gonna miss you dude. And I'm sure Tom will be great. Hopefully we'll see you in specials or something
Gave a like for the classic into
Watching matpats videos since 2018 was fun
bro was just roasting the game at the end XD
I watched this video when I don’t even know anything about Garten of banban, when i wached the video of him retiring, I couldn’t get a word out, I didn’t know what I was feeling, sadness, anger, shock, confusion, I have no idea, but 1 thing I do know is that they all tie around into one big thing, a thing that I don’t even know how to discribe, I feel like i had unlocked a new emotion that day.
POPPITY LAYTIM
Matpat as one of your last theory remember about that brawl stars cctv footage i wonder if we can have the theory
Wait
surely they slowly devolve the classic intro into the CLASSIC intro over the next few theories
THE CLASSIC INTRO!!
his last theory needs to be a fnaf theory
Yes. This is my nightmare. Because you are quiting from Youtube.
The last theory is gonna be a fnaf theory
IM SO EARLY  ^3^
Thank you for the last 13 years, MatPat
Is this what it feels like for someone who doesn't know fnaf lore to get it explained to them?   I haven't watched other videos on banban because it didn't interest me but since this is part of the final theories I did and jeez this is weird.
We will miss you matpat
Here since the one of the last theory’s for mat pat.
I'm gonna miss you matpat
Early 2 hours ago 9 THEORIES LEFT
nooooo not the british guy
D
Seeing the classic intro made me so happy 💖
I have an idea for a future theory  Pacific drive It is released on Feb 22 but you can get a preview build and it has a lot of backstorey and like to it
CLASSIC INTRO LETS GGGGOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will do one like for every push-up this comment gets
Omg it was not green red yellow green now its green red yellow blue i am happy
I really hope matpat could get a segment or something in the next theories for Garten of banban
I started crying when the game theory theme started playing. I couldn't comment on the other video cause I was in shock but I gotta say. Gonna miss you, MatPat. Can't wait to see what you do in the future and see where the Theorists' channels goes from here. I've been watching you since I was 14. 10 years ago. You were my teenhood and my adulthood, and since then I've gotten married and I'm having a child in May. You've helped me become the man that I am today and you will never know how. And thats not a theory. That is the love we have for you as your fans and as the theorist community. Thank you, MatPat. Thank you for everything.
MatPat: You got the intro back? Fans: Yes MatPat: What did it cost? Fans: Everything
OK 8 THEORIES REMAINOR 9
We need one last video for the best game in the world
I’m so sad. Matt you were my childhood will miss you so Much
You can’t imagine how much how much I smiled cause of that intro
There has to be an arg on this channel or I am not accepting you leaving Mat

It’s not just a theory it’s one of our last theories
Abanbandon all hope?
To think this is one of his final theory’s  are insane to me I remember being a kid being excited for a new game theory video every week coming home from school excited to see his fnaf theory’s we will miss you matpat
The classic intro bro.. that just brought me back to 2012 like holy cow bro..I’m going to miss this man so much.
I'm not ready to see him leave 😭
💜💛
1/9 Complete 😢
you guys DO Realize that he is ONLY Quiting GAME THEORY And Not THE OTHER CHANNELS Right?
The classic intro still slaps so hard

I’m dying inside     THIS MAN WAS/IS MY CHILDHOOD.  I DON’T WANT HIM TO LEAVE  😭

*Bro*

I just wish you did a souls episode such as Bloodborne or elden ring
The banban lore is actually crazy
Im gonna miss you MatPat 😢
Ill miss you so much matpat
Goodbye matpat. You were a legend. You are the foundation of my childhood
Will tryson take over all of the theorys channels then mappat your our hero
..
Of the many sins of Banban, taking up a slot among the precious remaining MatPat theories must be the gravest...
I'm gonna miss you so much dude I want you to continue please
Alright the whole car = freedom, bus = authoritarianism thing makes me sooo uncomfortable. Because in my experience reality is the exact opposite. When you're a child your parents decide where the car goes, you don't have a say where to go. Even when you're older a car straps you to the expenses to get it, the insurance, the fuel, the fees.  Meanwhile public transportation is freedom. If you're disabled, if you can't drive, if you're a child, it allows you to go where you want. Its cheaper more economical, less tied to lobies that try to stear global politics.  If cars are a symbol for anything its individualism.
Bro I was NOT expecting Choo Choo Charles in this game 😭😭 This game feels and looks like an acid trip 💀
Epic
thanks for giving me a panic attack matpat (the old intro)
Not hearing Matpat voice in these videos is going to be hard man
Science blaster is hitting different
AGBABGSGHAHGAG

The classic intro brought back so many memories, we’ll miss you Mat but you deserve this retirement
thank you for the old intro man. means a lot to me, and sure to everyone else. just that last.. last feeling of nostalgia before your leave.
In my opinion MATPAT and Markiplier are the greatest YouTubers ever
omg we still have 9 more videos
Don’t leave mat! We will miss you!
PLEASE STAY OR ATLEAST COME BACK IN 5 YEARS SO I CAN COUNTDOWN THE MINIUTESV
Bringing back the intro is like injecting nostalgia right into my veins. We will miss you Matpat!
💚💚💚
Can't wait for Tom to be the new host
Intro yessssss

Please don't give up your YouTube channel to Tom
One of the last theory’s

Mat-pat leaving hits harder than any bus
WOOO THE CLASSIC INTRO IS BACK
The intros are back!
THE NOSTALGIC INTRO ASWELL, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME CRYYY😭
Man I’m going to miss mat pat so much, like 13 yrs of running the channel and we’re stopping here but thank you mat pat for all of these channels, but that’s a theory A TEXT THEORY!!
I’m dead inside now it’s not a theory it’s a game theory
it's almost like he's still here 🥲
Sorry to hear garter of banban has to plague your last 9 theories but great job anyways. Love ya MatPat, going to miss ya’.
Will miss you MatPat
Respect to matpat a true legend
So sad to see him go
YAAAAAAAAA CLASSIC INTRO!! excited to see tom!!!
The theme throwback i never knew i needed.
:(
I would be slightly irritated, but I almost hope the goodbye video was a troll or something you two go back on. Only discovered this channel in 2023 right before the FNAF movie to understand why my sons loved it so much
Your actually making sense out of this dang.
“I’m not gonna cry.”  *classic intro*  “…😢”
i swear if he never comes back im quitting theorizing                                                 jk ill be sad tho
these uttp kids are really getting out of hand, also really sad to see matpat go
I'm really going to miss you MatPat, you've always been there since my childhood, and yes I understand you'll technically still be here, just in the background, but it just won't be same. Of course that doesn't I won't support the new host/s, In fact I'm quite excited for it as new younger generations will experience something that I and many others had with you. Still, I will always miss you, the one gave me fond memories, and the one taught me that I too might also change the world, no matter how miniscule.    (Ps: The idiots in this comment section that keeps spamming that their content is better like UTTP, BANGERCONTENT, TOMMYPARKPOLICE, should really the shut the fu** up. Content? You mean your channels I've obviously never heard off but still went ahead to check them. Only to find a singular video in only one of these channels,  that's not even a minute long, with nothing but slap stick images glue together with copyrighted  music playing in the back ground. Your unoriginal, Your not funny, Your not cool, and your subs ain't even reach the triple digits. The Fu** you mean your content is better...
I am so saf
I'm gonna miss you so much dude, I'll appreciate these last theories till the end.  9 Theories Remain
I’m going to miss Matpat as a host but omg I can’t believe how much I miss the OG opening too.
The classic intro omg 😭💕 I'm still not over the fact MatPat leaving I'm still tearing up
I’ll miss you and your old intro
“DARKEST TIMELINE“?!!?! COMMUNITY REFERENCE 😱🙀🙀
Nab Nab isn't being controled, that's nab nab's girlfriend that we created in one of the previous chapters.
i cant believe one of matpats last videos is on banban of all things...
I will miss you forever and never forget you, thank you so much for being a part of my life
I’m crying this was my actual child hood😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'm gonna miss this dude ❤😢. Before go though, please we need Pikmin theory after 13 years.
YOOO THE OLD INTRO
This makes me feel sad.
At this point no one is enjoying the theories anymore, everyone is just so sad about him leaving
IM NOT CRYING, YOURE CRYING
1:44 excuse what in the chicken noodle toaster strudel baby caboodle garden gnome two three four home alone cheese galore did i jist hear
Part 1 of commenting on every new game theory Matpat is a part of. I love what you've done over the years, thanks yet again \(@^0^@)/  (I know there are so many left, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see him pop up here and there over the years)
classic intro oh yes yippee :D
My hopes for the final theories: -A Pokémon theory. Lore based, I feel like a lot of the recent ones have been science based. -A Zelda theory. Probably something explaining TotK's weird timeline stuff. -A two-part FNaF finale. This is less of a want and more of an inevitability I think. -Something on any of the several more obscure games/game series I like. None in particular, and there's a lot, but something on any of them. I'm always more of a lore person than a science person, but I'd take either.
0:23 man this is way to much nostalgia I’m going to miss you matpat
Man I'm really gonna miss matpat
YESSS! I MISS THIS INTRO!!
Don’t quit your channel mat that we have a game for your support you ❤️
I watched this and almost cried
MATPAT PLEASE MAKE A TF2 THEORY BEFORE YOU LEAVE I BEG YOU!
We will really miss you, and tom, welcome to the game theory channel!
You sold out your channel years ago. This is old news.
The classic into goes so hard
I'm gonna miss this. Not Garten Of Banban but Matpat.
Matt pat we wish you god luck and thanks for that throw back

If u give ur wife the channel, then I’m very happy
.I was crying when he said he was living. It is never going to be the same without him 😭😢
Matpat has been a huge part of my childhood. It's hard to see him go.

Words cannot describe how happy I was when I saw the intro back, that intro should be at the beginning of every episode to be honest.
I had gotten so many flashbacks from the old intro 😭
So... You're just going to make us cry in every video now huh...   Well f**k me I guess
Everyone is talking about missing matpat in the comments, but nobody is talking about how matpat found sensical lore in garten of banban
Hi.

Why does the intro hit so hard, knowing this is one of Mat’s last theories
I’m so happy about the old intro
On popular demand the classic intro is back thanks for all matpat.
I love the Majora’s Mask sound effect in the beginning.
It was nice getting to hear and see that version of the intro! I definitely missed it!
I will miss you so much Matpat...It is going to hurt so much.
gonna miss matpat, but at least he’s gonna be able to pay attention to other things he’s been wanting to pay attention to
I still don’t want you to leave man😭
the memories that into gives me makes me a strange mix of sad and happy
Lets Enjoy the last Epic Theories we have left with MatPat:)
We will miss you, MatPat. Your legacy will not be forgotten and more childhoods will be ruined.

We love you, Mat!
That old intro takes me back to my younger days 😂😂😂
Yay the classic intro!!! We love you Matpat and we’ll never forgive you thank you for giving us yes, so much theories but especially so much memories. You helped a lot of us ❤
Bringing tears to my eyes knowing there's only 9 theories left while watching this. Got goosebumps hearing the classic intro song. Hopefully we get to give matpat a big send off at the end of all this.
Yeah
9 theories…
Everybody stop being sad we’ll see matpat again just not as often
There ain't no way 😭 first video out of 10 is a garten of banban vid
THAT INTRO GOES HARD
1 down 8 to go.. This hurts but the original intro is such a feel.
I don't get this... is someone taking over the channel or is the channel going to be deleted?
9 theory’s left to go
The old intro

I'm crying and shaking and all the other things I won't write into a comment!
His last vid 😭
Man I gonna miss these
Seeing the classic intro again had me so hype!!!
I hope Tom brings back an updated version of the intro. After a cold open, he could do a shorter version of the intro with updated graphics. That would be cool.
old into on top

Please that for the last for theroies we start to use some of the pervious versions of the orginal intros
"welcome to your nightmare" is very fitting But the thing is, Matpat leaving wasn't even in my darkest nightmares No, this is something much worse to me
The way I see it, the BanBan dream sequences are non literal and just symbolic, your seeing it through the perspective of yourself because you are who stinger flyn wants to show this to. He’s not showing you literal events, stinger just wants you to see this and apply the messages to the real escape
i'm going to miss Matt Pat but why did one of your last theories have to be on this game
YES! THE CLASSIC INTRO!
I will miss matpat, but I also think he really SHOULD leave, I mean, mental health is inportant
The choo choo Charles scene is funny as f
maybe i've been living under a rock but i haven't heard of this game series. this seems very interesting though.
I’m gonna miss you mat pat
You gotta do a theory about oddballs
by the way, it wasnt nabnab that got mind controlled. it was nabnaleena
The majora's mask sound effect at the beginning just shows how i feel about you leaving, empty yet happy for you making the right decision
RIP MATPAT
i love garten of banban!
Quit already
this is not normaly a video game im intrested in of learning the theory's but i cant not watch it now becous of matpat
8 theories remain
LETS GO YET AWW MAN
we will miss you matpat these 9 videos are going the best hours of my life and i just hope you will have an amazing family life.
Yaey ur not gone
Matpats leave is gonna hurt so bad dude..
Waiiit…. That’s not the classic intro! You must go further beyond!
Yessss I miss the classic intro🥲
❤❤❤
I'm disappointed. The classic intro? This isn't the classic intro! Where's Mario jumping out of Mat's head?
I missed the original intro also We will miss you matpat
I really just want that matpat to come back
I'll miss you matpat😢
I'm going miss MatPat, dude is a keystone in my life. And the classic into hits different now with him about to leave.  Best of luck you crazy nerd, we'll all be wishing you well
Let's gooooooo! It wasn't the classic intro I was expecting but seeing that with style Theory completing the player ring, that was legendary! love you Matt Pat❤️😎
i hope he finally covers the box from fnaf 4. the finally uncover the biggest seret of fnaf.
MATPATTTTTTTTT DONT LEAVE
I miss the classic intro. I hope Tom brings his own cool spin on a cool intro :)
The nostalgia I felt at the beginning
But hey that's just a theory, A GAME THEORY
THEY BROGHT IT BACK :DDDDD Edit: But in all seriousness though, Its a bummer That Matpat is leaving But we all will have to Move On. Still sad But still.
A final tf2 episode????? Nah jk
I want the classic-er intro
Before he goes let’s get him to 20M
Matpat you will be missed and won't be forgotten
garten of efing banban man indeed
Childhood = RUINED
The Circle is finally finished.
Didnt he said goodbye. What going on 😅😅
I’m gonna miss u dude :(
I already miss him 3-4 weeks left 😫
The -9 theories remain- with the zelda thing. We will all miss you so much man. Also please do a QnA
1:09 bro deliberately skipped Israel and Palestine💀
Its gunna suck to see matpat leave and i usually dont like new hosts, i try to, but tom is gonna be great!
Matpat u will never be forgettable nobody will say how is matpat
Bro i legit almost cried when i saw the original intro
So, I'm gonna talk about the actual theory rather than say another "I'm gonna miss him" line.  I'm a bit confused with the claim that the "Perfect Child" is the one of our perspective in the dreams. Was it the weird worm amalgamation that kept showing in the background far away in all those dreams? So how can it be represented as far away be also being our perspective character? Unless I missed something and the "Perfect Child" and that weird worm thing (Forgot it's name) aren't the same thing? I thought they were though
Whatever happened to floor five I think I know so basically the eruption blew it up to
8 more weeks…
he leaving is a just a theory right? A game theory.......?
What about the canon of you dyeing at the start of 6?
its going to be so sad to see matpat leave
I'm gonna miss matpat saying "but that's just a theory, a GAME theory!" TvT
Matpat needs to eat his last meal on Mythical Kitchen. Only then will I truly be sated
Great video 👍
Well atleast matpat didnt end the channel but  still im gonna miss him
(Insert that clip of Kingpin clicking his pen as I wait for the last one)
I'd love to see a theory video on Venineth or NaissanceE, they're both really abstract games and i think they would both make for fun video ideas
What about the blue cow that attacks you in chapter 6 ?
Matpat u will be missed will u still have ur insta ?
I’m gonna miss you so much what do I do😢😢😢😢
He should do one on kindergarten one or two and bring back Stephanie to voice Nugget
MatPat: I’m going to do 10 Theories before I leave   MatPat: I’ll use this to do BanBan
Matpat I love and I’m going to miss you but I cannot watch this
I’m going to miss you
Could you plz do one for banjo kazooie
bye bye matpat miss you so much dude
❤
One of matpats final theories was a BANBAN THEORY?!?! WHYYYY!??!?
this is the end of a great era and the nostalgic intro was a great idea
Matpat will forever be the theory lord
How can we be the prefect child when it is looking over us in a few of those same dream sequences
When he said classic intro I thought he meant the classic intro with Mario spinning at the start
I have a question You are only quitting game theory or all chanels BTW I will miss you 😢
So I guess parents will really create horrors beyond our comprehension instead of going to an adoption center
I cant I’m excited for Tom like a lot but I’m gonna lose it when MatPat leaves
God bless matpat.
I think the REAL lore of the game is the Euphoric Bros making a Sh*t Post out of a game.
9
Make a playlist of all the intros make new intros for the new hosts if matpat ever hosts an episode dont say anything about it in the intro just play the origenal intro and watch ppl freak out and get exited

Hey Matpat, can you do one of your last theories on Welcome Home? I enjoyed your series on that and the site has been updated since you last seen it.

I WILL MISS YOU IDK WHAT TO SAY BUT YOU MADE ME WHO I AM
3/10 of his final videos-
Ah the classic intro made me tear up a bit haha
It'll never be the same 😞
atleast his last 9 videos will be like 20 minutes long, so thats like 180minutes left
2023: *Thank you Scott* 2024: *Thank you MatPat*
For one if your last videos PLS I BEG YOU do a lethal company theory
Honestly, you give the Euphoric Brothers way too much credit...it's just one big cash grab.
Meetpeet😔
9 - theorys Left it feels like FNAF 4 ( 4 Days to the party ) but its not to party.....
We're going to miss you Matpat but I'm glad that you're going to put it on someone else's shoulders instead of and then the whole channel right then and there
I CANT SAY THAN DONE BUT BRO HE BROUGHT BACK THE OLD INTRO
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I swear if the last theory isn’t fanf ima go crazy😭
An interesting peek into the dream sequences. It only continues to get stranger and stranger...  Also, nostalgia bonus in the intro!!!
Ughh... Please not.

Don’t know why the intro was gotten rid of but the song is fire
The classic intro goes hard🔥🔥🔥
There must be lore in fishing planet

We love you mat. Nothing willl change that. We all will miss you tremendously. You're a big part of our lives and don't let the haters let you down, though im sure theire aren't any. Thank you for everything.
Tbh i think food theory should be for santi
I'm not gonna miss matpat if there's any more garten of banban theories
Matpat you will be missed
I swear my brain hears final hours from majoras mask
I didn't realize until I heard the Game Theory theme just how long it's been since I've heard it. Thank you.
Matpats one theory goes to this ripoff goofy game called garten of banban...
That surprise with the og intro got me to visibly smile, I wish every video until Matpat retires at least has the og intro
Can pls make a Video about brawl stars.there is neu lore
The old intro is so nostalgic!❤
Matt you will be known as a legend
I’m gonna miss matpat 😭
bye matpat 😭😭😭
9 theories left
This is our last video.
Mat i am sad to see you go but at least you can do whatever you like
It would've been hilarious if this was the last episode.
This doesn’t hit the same knowing he’s gonna be gone…
There's a guy in the replies of comments spamming that he hates matpat and he is shamefully self-promoting. Report him.
Hey MatPat can you  please make a final theory video about Petscop?
Yes the classic intro
0:20 GOD BLESS YOU, MATPAT! I have missed the full intro *so* much, it's not even funny. Seeing the logo with all four colors just makes it better.
The classic intro is what got me. We'll miss you when you're gone, MatPat.
I got to banban
I got excited when i heard the og intro
This man is truly a legend we will never forget about. It’s sad to know he is retiring. We will miss you man.
LETS GOOOOOO THEY BROUGHT BACK THE CLASSIC INTRO LETS GOOOOOOO I still don’t even know why they got rid of it in the first place lol
Idk what you have planned for your next 8 theories, but if you wanted to return to some classic vibes, you could try to figure out how powerful the laser in TOTK is or something similar. I think your old hookshot episode was one of your best in terms of your mathematical analysis.
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooo
all the theories to make the day better are now going away
The countdown has begun.
It's crazy I've been watch Matpat game theories for 10 years and I'll be 20 this year. My childhood hood is passing by.
I’m gonna explode.  Matpat don’t leave me alone pookie
bye bye matty patty
I CANT BELIEVE THEY BROUGHT BACK THE INTRO, ITS BEEN SO LONG!
o7
“Garten of F,in BanBan!” 0:07
I actually got goosebumps from the og intro
Will miss u matpat
Love how he brought back the classic intro. Ahh matpat this is why you made me grow up…
Thank you matpat
He should cover Autodale, as one of his last
Im very happy that he is uploading, but very sad that this is one step closer to not seeing him again
Of course the first of the 9 theories is a Garten of banban one 😭   We’ll miss ya Matt
Seeing the classic intro made me so happy. We're gonna miss you MatPat!
Matpat needs to do lethal company
No don’t leave
You made are childhood matpat thank you
Thanks a lot matpat for all of the joy you’ve given us
Who's taking over  gtlive
I am enjoying every moment of this episode before he leaves.
I wish patmat did a video explaining all of the lore of banban like he did with fnaf
Determination.    49 days left.
New theory buster can you ban the bots
Aw it's kind of sad that after waiting FOREVER Matt isn't going to be there for the theory on Poppy Playtime chapter 3 if it ever releases 😢
I must be old enough to think the "classic" intro isn't classic. It's still one of my favorites, though.
So glad to see the old intro back!
That intro hit so much!!!!
Garden of banban sucks (real)
THE CLASSIC KICKASS INTRO!!!!!!!
Sad he's never going to do a game theory on GTA 6 😭
Sucks to see one of the last mat pat theories being of a game that’s garbage and basically meant souly for content farms
Goodbye:(
Use the first version of the intro on the last video, please 🥲🥲
Life Will never be the same without Matpat
The classic intro 🕺
Love the nostalgic intro
Bro i predicted the intro coming back i joked with ny friends saying "mat is probably gonna yse the old  intro for the last episodes" and i was right but that was just a theory A FILM THEROY thanks for reading
hope the uttp stop soon matpat I'll miss u
i doubt matpat will see this, but can you, potentially, as one of the last 9 theories, make a roblox theory? yes there actually is roblox lore, and quite a bit of it
We are losing a lot of great YouTubers
*Thank you MatPat.* This is literally making me cry honestly :,]
Nabnab didn’t got mine control it was Nabnaleena that got mine control if look closely you will see her bowtie on her head
Duck. Yes.
Matpat we will miss you
Please don’t go just take a break for a while
omg the classic intro!!!! I love it
ROLL THE INTRO
for the very last theory please bring back the actual original like the 2011 intro please everyone will love it
YEEEESSS!!!! THE CLASSIC INTRO!
kk
See Ya I Will Miss You...
<3 that intro though
We will miss you matpat also i love the zelda Majoras mask styled 9 THEORIES REMAIN
I’m gonna miss you please don’t leave  The literally need you😢😭😭😭😭
Matpat will be missed 😢😢😢❤❤
Me with no storage bc  half  of matpats vids are downloaded on my acc 💀💀
this is going to be so sad
Sir D didn’t defeat NabNab, at least not permanently.  It was NabNaleena that got controlled.  Speaking of which, why has no one questioned how NabNab is alive after the third game?  Wasn’t it implied that NabNaleena killed him?
We’re gonna miss you MatPat thanks for all your theories, laughs, and memes.
Petscop 2 when
How about instead of mourning him leaving. Let’s enjoy the last theory’s he will voice.
We’re going to miss u
I can still hear him sometimes
DONT LEAVE US MATPAT
Who else started moaning when the intro hit
“Ruining your childhood since 2011” bro is our childhood 😭
Thank you for being my childhood 07
(‘:
This intro just hits different now
you should do an episode on PvZ2
Oh seeing the old intro hurts
THEE CLASSIC
Bye Matpat
i am gonna miss you mathew... still thank you so much for everything that you handled to us thru out this 13 years, and i watch you for like 9 of them? man... i am gonna miss your voice.
That classic intro is like dopamine pumped into my entire body simultaneously
I cried so hard
Bro let’s go the classic intro!
"Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened."
MatPat please do a theory about raldi's crackhouse before you go pls
Matpat leaving does feel like the Moon of Termina dropping upon us. Tom is cool, don't get me wrong, I'm sure he'll do great.
NO NO NO!
🫡.
Avoided the garden or bambam theories because couldn't care less about that project, but needs to at least watching the last theories by our host, Matpat.
Matpat didnt ruin childhoods. In fact he made them, I found friends just because we both liked Game theory and matpat. My friend Fiona and I are very sad but we both know that he'll be happier. Later Matpat. Like my school nurse said before he left- "this isn't goodbye, it's just see you later"
I WILL MISS YOU😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Please appear in the channel even in a year please
Thank you matpat
Matpat the legend 🙏
intro goes so hard
You made me appreciate this game, incredible Mat-Pat. Yes you are.
THE INTRO IS REAL!

Uttp is loser
Oh wow I love the intro so much so many memories
I love the Intro music man I hope it sticks around
i do wonder if for the lasy theory they are gonna bring back the OG intro, you know, the one with mario walking near the console logos

i'm matthew patrick brah  from youtube channel the game theorists brah
Maaaat
The begining of the end
We'll miss you Matpat.
I thought you quit
8 left 😢.
The blue quadrant FINALLY got the “ding” and glow that it’s deserved! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!
😢😢😢😢
That classic intro hit way harder than I could have anticipated… I’m gonna really miss MatPat man…
Do the og intro as the final theory intro
Seeing that classic intro really brought back memories. It’s almost like I’m back in middle school again, doing other peoples’ homework and only ever looking forward to getting back home and watching this show. Thank you, MatPat. I really needed that.
CLASSIC INTRO LETS GOOOOO
The title really fits, y'know...
AUGHH THE INTRO MAN SO FIRE I’m gonna miss this guy man.
Rip matpat will always will be in are ❤s
DO A ROBLOX THEORY PLS
Can we get a playlist for the final 10 theories?
Plz don’t leave matpat
Thank you matpat for being a legend
Matpat you are a true legend, thank you for everything
This intro will always be remembered
See ya bro
Matpat announces he’s leaving and then does a garten of banban video bro 💀
nice to hear the classic intro again
After everything Mat has done for me im DETERMINED to stick around to see the new era of GT!!! So excited for the future🎉
IM NOT READY FOR YOU TO LEAVE MAN
The intro felt oddly different then usual
You know what else is inescapable, tarkov
Matpat why banaban😅😅😂😂😂😅😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂
i do not know how matpat can simultaneously insult and compliment Garten of BanBan
Yess iv mist that introw
We'll miss you matpat, when the day comes you retire I hope you enjoy it.
Can all these bots stop spam replying your comments toxic things. THEY CAN GO HAVE DEPRESSION!!   And yes that means these bots must stop spam post toxic stuff.
You will be missed MatPat and I can't wait to see the next theory.
I would like to take over a channel
Thank you MatPat for all the memories you gave us all.
God, I cannot stress enough how happy I was to see the intro music back. I’m smiling and jumping in my seat like I’m a kid again
Man I missed the classic intro so much and it’s a great way to send off a legend! Gonna miss you a ton MatPat😢
We will miss you matpat and you were my brothers childhood you will be missed.
I think that for the final theory mat should use the first ever intro for game theory or a combination of the other theory channels intro
Goodbye matpat
We love you matpat❤❤❤
that intro goes harder than any anime intro
Looks like MatPat is passing his sanity of FNAF to the new guy
Do a terraria theory
It almost doesn’t feel real that Matt Pats leavening. Thanks for all the memories. :]
Matpat please don't leave us you were my favorite Youtuber as a little kid and Danno cried when he found out that you are leaving forever
THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE LEGEND. HES BAAAACCCCKKKKK
2h I was here  I will miss matpat doing game theory
I think I just cried of nostalgia when I heard the into 😭 we’re gonna miss you mat pat
Mods, banban him.  Last joke I will do for matpat... Sad to see him go.
Classic intro is peak
His last theory better be of FNAF 😭😭 gonna miss you so much Matpat
Only 200k Views like mrbeast got this in 5 mins this is dumb how is a man who is leaving youtube getting this little attention😢
The classic intro 😭❤
YESS THE OG INTRO IS BACK FROM THE DEAD
Actually Matpat, Nabnab wasn't mind controlled by Dadadoo, but it was Nabnallena. She has a glowing bow.
Abanbandon all hope
Bro im gonna miss you so much :(
I’m going to miss MatPat and is silly video 🐻🐰🐤🦊 😢
Goodbye
I'll be watching each theory matpat I'll miss you  Edit:Also guys do not comment on the uttp guys just report them if you commet they are getting the attention they want

Mat pat I'm going through the 5 stage of grief . The stage is anger but love you man
MatPat, we will miss you so much and I was very happy to see the classic intro again!
Maaaaaaan…..you made me so happy with the classic intro. This is amazing matpat and i loved every second
God seeing the old intro again makes me so happy for some reason
the intro gave me instant goosebumps
😢
The intro used here is by far the best
I’ve never been so sad to see more theories 😔
This feels unreal, seeing matpat go, but I understand his reasons and am Waiting for the next era of game theory
MatPat, I'll miss you a lot. Also, I LOVE the old intro and i'm glad you brought it back, even if it's for your last 10 videos on the Theory channels
matthew, please, why.......
At least we have these last theory’s
MAN HE IS A LITTERAL MARK IN MY LIFE IM GONNA CRY WHEN HE MAKES HIS LAST VID PROBABLY AS MUCH AS WHEN TECHNO DIED. :( rip techno and farewell matpat
Classic intro was definitely the right move here!
This man is quitting and one of the last videos is a garden of ban ban one rlly? Doesn’t matter idc
This is going to be emotional next few weeks. Hope this channel thrives and Matt can have his well deserved break.
Throwback
MatPat is awesome
This is stressful seeing matpat leave yt
Hey Mat the worst part of making the world a better place is that everyone is going to miss you when you're gone and too bad i didn't even have a chance to meet you since you know i'm polish anyways i hope you'll have a bright future cya
I can’t, not just 9.
Matpat we will miss you you are a legend ❤️
1/9 8 more
I love the classic intro!
Classic intro just made my day
Sucks that one of the last theories is on 🤮🤮 Garten of BanBan
When are super amazing endcard tournaments coming back?
Idk how to respond to any of this so Imma just give the cliche imma miss you so much
LESSGOOOOOOOO  I WILL MISS YOU MAT
The old intro nearly made me cry, so nostalgic
Heck yeah! The oh intro is back!
The beginning of the end is upon us.
Perfect theory: monsters of Etheria on Roblox I’m wondering if there is any lore about the D.A.R.C facility please do a theory about it
.
Can you please do a theory about sonic frontiers please
THE LAST THEORY HAS TO BE WITH SCOTT PLEASE BRO
That intro though...😎
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
why is there so many bots omg
Ew, public transportation slander. Gotta say, having a functional bus network in my city and *not* being forced to pay tons of money on a car is pretty freeing.
quick thing i noticed whle watching: at 7:49 matpat says that nabnab got caught, i believe this is not the case, i believe that it is nabnaleena from the 3rd game that got caught, because of the bow on the head instead of the party hat. before anyone says "what if the hat clipped through the celing" it hasn't done that in any of the other games, it must be nabnaleena
The classic intro is nostalgic on a nother level
No not Matpat!
Please bring back all the classic intros
Um I'm not trying to be rude or anything but Nabnab ain't in Sir Dadadoo's group that's Nabnaleena
THE CLASSIC INTRO GOES CRAZZZZYYYYYYYY
It’s gonna hurt so much but atleast we all made memories with matpat so let’s make the most of these theories
Thank you MattPat for ruining/creating our childhood, you will be missed  Salute
Thank you for everything I am so sad to see you go march 9th will be the darkest day in YouTube history
Matpat plz do a theory on the lore of warthunder!!
Gonna miss you man
You have no idea how happy I was to see the original intro. Literally put a smile on my face.
Ignore all the hatespam. You will be missed!
Hearing the intro brings a wave of nostalgia and it makes me very happy. I’m sad to see MatPat go, but I’m also excited to see where the new hosts take us.  Please keep the intro for all future installments of game theory
PLEASEEEEEEEEEE DOMT LEAVE FOREVERRRRRRR
I want to CLASSIC intro from 2013
The old intro💔
Pikmin theory?😢
The Nabnab we see control by dadadoo is not NabNab but the female version we created in chapter 3. So NabNab is still running around as a giant spider monster.
one of nine.
We will all miss you MATPAT and UTTP sucks
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!
THE INTRO
bye matpat
I was hope for 7 days to die lore from you Mat honestly, but I guess not sense you're leaving the Youtube!
Man brought out the OG INTRO! Thats how you KNOW this is a LEGENDARY moment in YT HISTORY!!!
Me seeing the classic intro: YEAH BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait wait wait. Hold on a second. @07:49 I too originally thought that it was (from left to right)  NabNab, Turtle/Lizard, Banbolina, Dadadoo, Cat-Rex, BitterGiggle, and Opela Bird, with BanBan standing next to us. But I..dare I say we were wrong. It's NOT NabNab, it's NABOLINA! 🤯 So what happened to NabNab?! Inquiring minds want to know!
Tthank you for everything Mat i sure will miss you with my brother...
I'm gonna miss matpat so much... Bro was childhood.
Hearing that intro again, I'm gonna cry
Bring the 8 bit intro rah!!!
My fav intro was the Film Theory but seeing you are leaving us I would like to ask if MatPat would comment back to me just to show he personally watches the comments. Just to reply as I say goodbye old friend. :(
Matpat I will make a video decade to helping win the fight against garden of banyan poppy playtime and fnaf help wanted
IM GONNA MISS MATPAT :(
I think we're all gaslighting ourselves into thinking banban has any redeeming qualities.
The intro i grew up with
I just hope that MatPat will give a Chapter 3 theory on poppy playtime before he will retire...😥😥
Hey mat could you please do a terraria theory of some kind
can we get matpat 20 mil on game theory at least before he quits?
O7
Gonna miss u Mat.:(
Goodbye math Pat. I will always remember you😢😢😢😢

Can you do a Lethal Company Theory?
Goodbye matpat we will miss you
YESS I HEAD BANGED TO THE INTRO SO HARD
YES THE INTROOOOOO
Matpat, please, just at least every new years tell us how its going… after you retire…
Maybe the person you play as in the dreams, could be the child that our character is searching for. And at the last dream it shows banban kidnapping us.
Bro did MatPat really waste one of the last theories on banban 😭😭
He'll yeah I've been waiting for a new episode
I'm still waiting for Kirby is evil part 2
You won't be missed
Everyone's gonna miss u matpat love you
Didn't ever expect to cry from a GT intro but... Whoa...

matpat will be missed and be allways known for [thats just a theory] i wonder how tom will run the channel🤔
I hope jadu livs with you matpat
I dont even care if I dont care about the franchises or topics Mat covers in the last 9, I'mma watch the heck outta them. Can't wait for him to FINALLY do Deltarune Chapter 2 :)
I will miss you matpat goodbye
I am going to miss matpat more
That moment you get chills from the original intro
I still can't believe matpat is quitting!
THE OLD INTRO
It should have been fnaf!  It should have been fnaf!!! Goodbye Matt, thank you For everything
Learning to drive does open up the map; before that exploration is SO SLOW
No!!!! Hand it down to Mr beast
I stopped watching him but because he's leaving soon I'm going to cherish every moment of the rest of his content
Mat pat didn't just make thereys he makes memories
I’m watching every episode even the ones have no interest in because he’s retiring
That old intro made me feel so much I can’t describe
😢 don't leave us
And  you forgot the actual game that HAS THE MOST LORE THAN ANY OTHER ONES IT IS ONLY FOR THE WII FROM A NOW DEFUNCT COMPANY THE STUDIO DISNEY SHUT DOWN WITH THEM JUNCTION POINT STUDIO CALLED THE GAME DISNEY EPIC MICKEY FROM 2010 NOVEMBER 25TH HAS LORE PLEASE HAS THE MOST OUT OF ANY OTHER DISNEY PROPERTIES BUT ANOTHER THEORY  OF MINE IS THAT EVERY. NEW AND OLD EXCEPT FOR ALICE AND WONDERLAND AND JUNGLE BOOK AND PREP  AND  LANDING ARE ALL CANNON IN MY OPINION THAT THE REST OF THE POPULAR MOVIES ARE JUST MICKEY MOUSE,S DREAMS THEY ARE LIKE NOT REAL THING IS THAT THESE MOVIES ARE NOT MOVIES THEY ARE DREAMS OF MICKEY MOUSE AND HIS FRIENDS AND THE EPIC MICKEY CARTOON  WASTELANDERS ARE THE ONLY ONE REAL
We will miss your amazing intro
Istg please don’t waste your theories on banban🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I just thought of something crazy. What if the "perfect child" is actually what your playing as. Like what if now when you play your actually the perfect child that managed to look like a human and have a family or something. Maybe that's why the character you play doesn't talk.
the way i was sooo happy i almost screamed from nostalgia when i saw the intro
PLS I BEG YOU DON'T QUIT😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gonna miss Matpat
We all are going to miss you❤
thank you matpat
Who else is going to miss matpat?
Let's be real, no matter how clever or how much effort you put into weaving the world's most perfect plottwist, you'll never get a reaction on the same level as Matpat seeing Choo-Choo Charles.
why is this the first of the final 10.....
i enjoyed the intro
im gonna miss u
Matpat dont leave please take my first-born child dont leave 😭😭😭
I have never heard of this game.. can’t wait to watch a whole video theory about it!!!!
Hearing the classic intro made me feel a nostalgia that beat out even the Matpat retirement video
Man no wonder you're leaving if I had to play Banban I'd leave too, I'll miss you Mat thanks for the childhood.
The fact that for one of his last theory’s he does GARTEN OF BANBAN is so funny. Sad to see matpat leave
We’ll miss you matpat
OMG the classic intro. I chose Science Blaster for my High School graduation in like 2016 or so.
are you f***ing kidding me. GARTEN OF BANBAN. OF ALL THINGS.
Please do Mutant Cat (which is on Scratch) lore. I made it and it would make me happy if you did.
i remember the classic intro from the first 3 theories i saw.
man im gonna you Mat pat you are my literal chilhood
Old intro hits just right.
So are you going to use older amd older versions of the intro until your last video has the first intro?
0:21 I missed this!
rip MattPatt 2011 to 2024
I don't even know what a Banban is but I gotta honor my bro Matpat for all these years
To be honest, my favourite part of the Game theory universe is GTlive. However, that also means by watching this MaptPat spoiled his unreleased video of Banban VI, if it will happen. But I'm not actually sure if he finished the game or did this video first
Frfr
What if we’re one of the scientists and the child we’re looking for is the “perfect child” experiment thing?
The old intro in its final form brings back memories.
You make me cry dadpat but I'm happy you can retire
OG INTO 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Welp, 9 more weeks guys. We gotta get matpat to 20m before the goodbyes. Hate comments dont work uttp, youre an idiot who wants to be as popular as matpat, you are the one who shouldnt come back, like if you agree
Another wonderful theory. :)
Its been so long since I saw that intro
I will miss matpat when he leaves
The intro gave me chills.
I feels so depressing to watch his videos now
The old intro takes me back to summers where I would watch your videos all day long. Im gonna miss matpat
Never thought I would see you quit YouTube
Just as the four theorys where put together,our hero leaves us(i meant about all the versions of game theory)
The old intro! My heart!
I started crying when I saw the disclaimer
Man we Will miss you
Be safe Matpat we will miss you
Finally the old intro is back! Tom you better keep it!
AAAAAA THE OLD INTRO IM SO. HAPPY.
Oh I miss the intro, plz do the intros for the other channels plz
We’re gonna miss u matpat :C
THE CLASSIC INTRO😭😭 NOSTALGIA
Mat pat is going to be missed so dearly by me and many others. We will never forget you my friend. ❤
With tom game theory will no longer be the same as it was before with matpat we'll miss you matpat😢😢😭😭😭😭
Noooooo bro one of his last theories wasted on garden of banban
Goodbye…we love you…we will miss you were our childhood and im still sad that you are just handing your channel down away…:(
Glad to see THE Intro i kinda missed it
wont be the same without you man
Huh, i see, I wonder what will be next and if this will be true.
But that’s just a theory A GAME THEORY
9 Theories remain...
U NEVER RUINED CHILDHOODS😭😭😭😭 YOU CREATED THM😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t wait to see the final theory intro, it will HAVE to be the most amazing intro ever
I can't believe I really cried at banban theory.  I still want to believe it's a joke like fnaf movie doesn't including MatPat. I'll miss you Matt. Really really miss you.
Praise the lord (or MatPat) for bringing back the true intro! Haven't seen that gem for way to long!
Man, I will miss matpat Also if the UTTP comments on this comment they are definitely not only bots but bots made by some children or smthn
MATPAT NEVER LEAVEEEEEE PLEASE PLEASE😭😭😭😭😭
Still hoping matpat would still get to do a theory about lethal company 😅
I'm gonna miss him so much, he was my whole childhood
Man matpat Would love lethal company
1st dream is just a domain expansion 😂
I well miss him so much bro 😭
The intro brought so many flashbacks 😢
plz dont quit
I’m not gonna deal with theories without this man
Man, this sucks
I would love for you to do another brawl stars theory
Your gonna have a brilliant successor mate, don't worry and enjoy your retirement.
>bringing back the classic intro I missed this Can we get the ORIGINAL, ACTUAL TRUE classic intro from 2012 too tho~? >:)

MatPat you are my favorite youtube but before you leave i need you to do a theory on LETHAL COMPANY
I don’t play garten of ban ban so it’s kind of sad that this video has No relevance to me
You were amazing you have been a major thing in my childhood watching you made me get through so many things i will miss you so very much we love you matpaz goodbye…❤️
One of the last theories and you do it on an irrelevant game? 😭
WE GOT THE INTRO WITH THE 4 COLORS NOW
Matpat 😢
Matpat, you are the first YouTuber that made me feel we aren’t just numbers. Thank you for the dedication and I hope you have a happy family life! ❤
You deserve the best.
Matpat should be allowed to swear without having to censor himself. He’s earned it
Do the MARIO ARG
Post slower please  I want to enjoy the last times I have of watching you
As soon as i heard the intro i started tp dance! I'm gonna miss this.
On one of your last theories can you do warrior can or wings of fire  I would like see it 🙏 👍 👎 pls
We will miss you Matpat please do a Beyblade theory, it would be legendary to see. Even if you don't I wish you well in your future and we will all miss you ,steph, ollie and the team. Wishing these nine theories are legendary.
Matpat ignore the rude comments
Matpat is a star in the darkness
THE ORIGINAL INTRO IS PEAK. IM GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH MATPAT
It will not be the same
I still can't believe that matpat going to leave
I’ll miss you so much
The beginning of your last Saga opening with your original game theory titles sequence brought back so many memories. Made me kind of emotional. I've been watching this channel almost since it started. I remember rushing to get all my homework done so I watch all of your latest theories. I'm going to miss you MatPat.
Oh gods the memories of the classic intro. I didn't realize how much I missed that  To build onto the idea that the lanky weird rejected thing being created with a real kid. I bet it's actually YOUR kid that was used and you'll find that out in the 7th episode
as soon as i saw the og intro all the og theories  came flooding back
I don’t care about Ban Ban I’m here for Matpat.
I'm gonna miss you alot matpat. Stay safe!! ❤
Man I missed the old intro
GEOMTRY DASH THEROY PLZ
Mat pat I have a complaint can u block these bots that are spamming on almost every comment?
Bringing back old memories just to see them wip and nae nae into the sunset we will miss you matpat
Let’s do this mat
That intro hit hard!
1st one 9 more I am so not excited for him to go…
That intro hit so hard

It's gonna be a little wierd without matpat as the main host, and man I missed the old intro too
I WILL MISS YOU I CRYED SO MUCH WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE LEAVING I will always remember you. Thank you for helping me through the worst times of my life
Ty for everything MatPat, you where a big part of my childhood
...game theory.
Be careful, this spoils out the story of the last chapter or the last video posted on GTLIVE from now
I didn't play Garten of Ban ban, but this was freaking interesting everyone's talking about how they will miss Mat Pat a lot nobody is even talking about the video
guys what is wrong with you UTTP he only has 9 theories left😭
It is amazing to see the intro back, its been 3 years. Thank you MatPat, well miss you
Love the og intro
Matpat U made my childhood I know u have a kid now.. But it hurts to see u go. Im glad ur back for just 9 theories
I wish he did cult of the lamb
We’re all going to miss you :,)
You were my childhood. I’m gonna miss you so much.
We will miss you... 🥲
That's not classic enough. We need MOAR CLASSIC INTRO
Don't leave please
Crying rn
:(
Hey matpat I just watched half of your first video that you made
I teared up at the og intro
For a second I thought mat pat was trying to make a pun with banban by saying aBANdon all hope.
Im gonna miss you but i cant wait to see the person your passing it on too
The end of a cherished era The start of a new era
We are gonna miss you
PPLLSSS DON'T LEAVE
im a sad boi now, im happy for him though
Not the into almost making me cry. Absolutely not, that's be ridiculous.
Lets cherish those last moments🙏
😮
its just a theory that he is leaving, think about it. his whole channel is theory's. so who said it is truly known he is leaving.
9...
I for one love this intro
After all of this all i can say is enjoy youre retirement
I need the game theory intro on my playlist
Make up your mind retire or cringe
I feel sad when I watch now
Wait didn't he quit??
rip well goodbye...
Lets freaking gooooooo! I have missed the old intro for so long and it has finally returned. I got shivers down my spine
The classic intro made me cry, thanks.
8 left...
Ah man am gonna miss Matpat he's dude great master at theory's and now this God dangit
THE CLASSIC INTROOOO!!!
I just came over here from rewatching the fnaf series and I can't express how much this made me happy
Well, there's one bright side. MatPat won't have to talk about this series again.
When he said classic, I thought he meant the intro from the veeerrry beginning.
I got a theroy the dude you race with in Mario sunshine is nabit
8 more videos
I love seeing the old intro again
Tell Tom to keep the old intro please
I iwll mis atpat so much but what is so cool is that considering he can do 9 theories left, then this means he definitly will do chapter 3 :)
Matpat was my WHOLE Childhood and I LOvE the OLd OPeNInG
Only MatPat could make Garten of BanBan really interesting
oh I can feel my bones and sore muscles that intro being back was so much and I’m so glad
Matpat, I'll miss you
i practically feel attack by my braincells
These bots are another type of rock bottom low.
The rest of myb life with out this.....
Matpat of your reading this wen  poppy play chapter 3 comes out plz play it for your final video (\_/) (•.• ) ❤<  Bye GAMETHEORY
YouTube is going to miss you mat ❤
The classic intro really hits different
E
The old intro 😭💓>>>>>>>>>  (i'm gonna miss Matpat sm💀💔💔.) but it okey. Thank you Mat♡!
THE OLD INTRO OFBJAIRHWKBDS
ill miss ya
That aint the classic intro 🤨
To be honest, from a video I watched from FusionZgamer, you should give the channel to him because he said, "But hey, that's just a theory"
Its kinda funny how game theory was launched the same year i was born
Thank you mat for everything
Nothing beats the classic intro.
I’ve been a fan of MatPat since age 9. And now I’m 15, man I’m gonna miss MatPat.
9
I’ve missed the classic intro
U know, I will be dropping off after u finish matpat. Game theory is over without you.
hi
Why must he leave?  I’ll miss him so much
😢
im not even a banban fan, i just gotta watch the last 9 matpat theories 😭😭😭
The end is near
He could’ve done anything as one of his last videos… and he does some autistic incredibly unscary game 😐
Am I the only one who doesnt see the new intro at the start? Its the newest one?
Matpat you mean 2024 🤓
He'll yeah we have the classic intro
I know I'm a little late what's my pet matpat we're sorry we will stop making mean memes about you will make nicer ones just don't leave jk I hope you do what honesty you deserve this break more than anyone you have been doing this since I was seven thanks for everything ❤
I cried during this entire video
that classic intro made my heart sink im gonna miss matpat so much dude
wait but at the end nabnab is not there did he not get infected or like what?
I hope we get special episodes with matpat once in a while. Like once or twice a year
7:50 pause. That isn't nabnab, that's nabnelina or whatever her name is. Nabnab has a partyhat, and the female version a bow. That does not look like a party hat.
Please finish Petscop
I’m gonna miss you
❤❤❤ loving every video, going to miss you!
1h
0:43 Just made my day 😭😭😭
ohhh the intro... made me tear up
I'm going to miss you matpat😢😢😢
Gonna miss you matt
I really hope he does the brawl stars theory
WHY THIS ONE 😭🙏
If you ever get the chance I saw on GTLive that u did welcome home's newest update. Are u gonna do a theory on it?
The beginning of the end…
That’s nabalina 7:50 the hair bow
Tom reminds me of matpat, while I’m sad mats retiring I’m really exited to see what Tom does with game theory
Man the intro's nostalgic. Please don't leave.🙏🙏😭😭
Wait intill alan fisher hears about matpat car and public transportation comment.
It's so cool to see the full theory crest in the intro
I say ditch the kids 😂😅
Lol one of the last theories is Garten of Bambam. I wonder what the last last theory will be?
I’m glad this was not the final episode
I'm so happy I've been waiting for the intros for so long, but then I'm also sad.
really bro this as one of your last vids...
Please… don’t go… Im going to miss you, man.
I love the way the old intro looks with the fully finished logo is amazing. When I saw his video saying that he was retaining was the same night I made my first video here on YouTube. This channel is almost as old as I am and I can't wait to see what happens with my favorite YouTube. Thanks for everything you've done for everything you done MatPATT thank you.
YEAHHHHH THE OG INTRO!!!!!!
Can you make a theory on lethal company
This is year is am going see every new video theory from matpat Still It really mad that one of last video is about banban It really shows that this guy make the randoms theory about everything that is really one of the I love matpat and still will even at the end👍
That intro made me wanna cry 😭
rip matpat i will miss you
seeign the old intro again is so nostalgic
The lore of BanBan is so confusing because there are so many random moments happening. Like the ChooChoo Charles and seeing the naughty ones.
What am I watching
everyone needs to stop moping in his comments
It was a journey as I slowly lose my childhood I become a man, goodbye Mat.
I saw tom on one of the tiktoks and so far im loving his energy. He seems fun & passionate and im excited to see what direction he goes on this channel
NOO 9
I remember the old intro I am so going to miss you game theory
9...
Im gonna miss you.
The last theory
The intro I’m gonna cry
😭
😢 miss u matpat
He sounds sad and no more energetic
Like when the intro started I was tearing up but with a smile on my face what is going on here
You know, I ironically thought a ban ban theory would be one of the final 9 just because… I WASNT ACTUALLY EXPECTING A BAN BAN THEORY
Naah Game Theory without MatPat is just... Well it's nothing
9
IS ANYONE ELSE CONFUSED AND MILDLY ANGRY AT THESE UTTP BOTS?? LIKE WHAT IS UTTP AND WHY ARE YALL SO MEAN 😭
Nooo plz dont leave
*vibes to the old intro*😁
I will still miss you MattPat I had my birthday yesterday
we will miss you mat pat you will not be forgotten :(
God
I feel like that could be Nabnaleena mind controlled and not Nabnab. It looks like her bow is highlighted showing it's her and not Nabnab. But I could be totally wrong. But if it is her, then Nabnab is probably still that huge monstrosity.  Also thanks for being a huge part of my childhood, Matpat!!
AINT NO WAY THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST THEORIES
classic intro goes so hard
I swear bro. New garten of banban games drop faster than I can breath☠️
wow...
im definitely gonna miss matpat
Nooo We are going to miss you matpat!

I have a game theory, is the theory logo of all channels is actually a Simon color electronic game?  Ps: I’ll miss him
Nice touch adding style theory to the opening
Finally the classic intro is back 0:27  also now we can finally see the new Game Theory logo in the intro. It kinda looks like Simon says!
I’m gonna miss you big it’s not gonna be the same

Literally sobbing at the classic intro- you deserve the world matpat! Cant wait for these last few theories, then you can enjoy your well deserved retirement from youtube- I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart thank you so much for being a part of my childhood (any many others). You are so awesome and make me want to make theories on games myself! We all love you matpat, thank you for these last 13 years!

banaban
I'm gonna miss you a lot matpat. You are one of the best YouTubers, and a big part of our    childhoods. We are really gonna miss you

48,666

Honestly i was waiting for the classic intro to come back but the fact he's leaving makes it kinda sad
Matpat where going to miss you and thank you for being apart of my childhood ❤
Gonna miss you so hard

I don't know if you are going to see this comment but you are the reason I know most of my favourite games like FNAF,  Garten of Ban Ban,  popy playtime,   rainbow friends,  Even minecraft.    So your videos meant A LOT to me.  LIKE SERIOUSLY,  I am really going to miss you matpat❤❤❤
dude im going to miss matpat so unbelievably much. He pretty much shaped my childhood.
First technoblade and now matpat.
I used to watch you as a kid now 18 years old a young adult and now matpat is leaving so much memories so many theories am gonna miss you matpat you will be forever a childhood YouTube channel.
is it gus the bus perhaps ?
Oh my god classic intro YES
I literally started really watching these channels like a month ago and now he’s leaving:( I support it but idc who replaced him in other videos I’d skip them because it wasn’t mat
0:27 THE WHEEL IS FINALLY COMPLETE
Poppy playtime 3 better come out before matpat leaves, I at least want one of his last theories to be on either FNAF or poppy
All four colors on the logo
ULTRAKILL COME ON MATTPAT
1 down 8 more to go
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Remember, its just, and still is, and always will be, a theory...
He has like the best voice in youtube
:(
Knowing that you’re been going to be gone soon I can’t help but cry when I Watched this video
everywhere i go , i see his face  i cant live without this intro man
I missed this intro for so long!
Well matpat since your retiring I have one question In an all out brawl how would win Sonic or Mario
:(
"If you dont know where you are, how do you know where your going?"👁
Why are there so many bots saying WHO ASKED + MY CONTENT IS WAY BETTER                                   UTTP IS WAY BETTER                                                   I HOPE MATPAT NEVER RETURNS.
Same I’m missing him I trued to watch all his vids bc he was so fun
I will miss you matpar
Is Tom who does those bad minecraft theories? :/
Gonna miss you matpat
We’re gonna miss you thank you for the theory’s.
We aint kids anymore
Pls Roblox lore
Gonna miss you matpat you made my day everyday. gonna miss you getting bullied by Scott Cawthon
My heart hurts bro
I'm gonna miss MatPat I found out about him 4 years ago when I was in 6th grade before that I didn't really use YouTube I'm sad that he has to go
On god
😢Surprise show ups?
This still isn't real the old Intro gave me goosebumps and I'm just sad it's the end of a chapter
This theory only strengthens my belief that one is not playing a human, but one of the creatures.
MatPat 4Ever. Tom will never compare. Sorry Tom😕
We’re going to miss you matpat hopefully in the future I’ll be able to ruin my kids childhood like you ruin mine 🥹
The old intro… where have the years gone. It feels like I was just watching fnaf videos on my black tablet on the living room floor yesterday
I hope the last theory is fnaf, it would be poetic!
when the old intro started playing i got chills
All things aside, i hope one of matpats sendoff theories is one of undertale/deltarune, with the somewhat newfound knowledge that toby and matpat are cool with eachother after that one incident i feel it would be cool for mat to finally come back and give his thoughts on deltarune chapter 2 and so on
I hope mapat makes a poppy playtime theory before he leavs
I am gonna cry so much when matpats gone
Matt😢 whyyyyyyyyyy
The old intro almost made me cry.
Matpat we are going to miss you so much
9 theories left
I love you matpat ❤️
I lived off of this 2011 I'm so sad to see it go
Going to miss you alot man. I remember I was in Middle School in 2014 when I found your channel with your very first FNAF theory and have stuck around ever since
7:33 that’s not nabnab that’s nabaleena
THE CLASSIC INTRO IS BACK LET'S GO
It’s been a long ride lads, let’s see this one through. Wherever you go from here, Godspeed MatPat, Godspeed.

The classic into will always have a place in my heart.
❤❤❤❤❤
MatPat we love you
It whod be great if before matpat left we get the last theory intro as ALL of the intro
I never thought that intro would make me so sad and melancholy as it does now 😭
Thank you so much for bringing back the old intro it brings back nostalgia. I’ll miss you, you are my childhood.
I was always exited when he makes a new episode, but now I'm kinda sad...
I'm sad

The intro😢
Ima miss you dude. I'm not gonna frown because it's over. Ima smile because it happened. Have fun in retirement
Will you come back... Come back to the channel
Garten of banban is like a fever dream 😅😂🤣.
Oh my god the classic intro😭😭😭😭😭😭
This man really soft launched our most gut wrenching loss and gave up so much even now
oh, the memories i have just from an intro
Это прекрасно, но очень грусно осозновать что осталось не так много времени с Matpat...
Yes the old intro! Love you man, gonna miss you.
Gonna miss you MatPat but so happy to see you moving on to new things. You guys deserve it!
We are gonna miss you matpat               Can you make a theory about Qandys loop series an bee swarm
9 theories remain… We’re going to miss you, MatPat. We wish this was just a theory… A game theory…😢
Loved the return of the old intro! We will miss you matpat and all of they joy you’ve brought us.
Ruining your childhood since 2011 XDDDD Hope he is just joking with that cuz i saw every fnaf theory
That intro almost made me cry😢
YESS THE CLASSIC INTRO
I'll tell my descendants of a great theorist who brought plausible answers to so many of mankind's greatest mysteries   My family will at least remember the Matt Era
Callmecarson will be summoned.
Gosh I love that intro
Let’s go the classic intro is back!
The classic intro will always slap.
One of The last matpats videos is Garten of banban 😢
If the last video uses the first ever intro I can die happy
Garten of banban is kinda walking thin ice rn, the choo choo charles in a GOB is not a really great idea, the creator of choo choo charles is pretty much like nintendo with the protection of their ip :/
What u guys mean matpat is leaving? He is going to be making theorys forever, no i am not in denial 🥲
😊9
Bro when that intro music started playing I nearly teared up.
I am going miss miss matpat
Stay please I beg you
why was the intro ever gone in the first place?
Maaaaaan, I never thought I could get emotional looking at a freaking intro video. Nostalgia hit hard
god i missed the old intro
YAY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING BACK THE CLASSIC INTRO FOR THE FINAL COUNTDOWN MATPAT!
OF COURSE THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST
I am going to miss matpat doing these but he will still be working on the videos just not as much and not hosting so hopefully they don’t loose their flair. I wish we could get another welcome home video soon but I don’t think there’s been any new updates with thay
OMGVG JUST STOP WITH THE "WErE GonNA MIsS YoU maTPaT" LIKE JUST ENJOY THESE LAST THEORIES.-

Me seeing "9 theories remain"- :'(  Me hearing the original intro- :')
You need to write him for my grandchildren bringing our nostalgic Hero for theory show.
Man, I genuinely missed the classic intro.   ..it’s like a friend who came back to say hello after so long..   And they even added Style Theory to the wedge in it!
I love your OG intro, and I hope your team keeps it!
The bots are spamming so much that there are 731 replies on @biglou0404's comment when the limit is 500.
You will be missed matpat we loved all of your video's
Genuinely gonna find it hard to enjoy these as I know it's a countdown to an end of an era
i actually shook when he brought back the classic intro. that really got me
Who’s possessing cupcake?
A wise man once said, don't cry because its over, smile because it happend.
It’s kinda nice seeing the old intro, even though MatPat is leaving. It’ll be sad seeing MatPat leaving.
please dont ever not use the classic into !
Legend has 9 theories left...
Hopefully Matt pat a full compilation of his 10 or 9 theroy we will miss you mat pat you were the king of theroy Oh, how the legends have fallen.
Well I wished to be call out or mentioned in a video of matpat sir but it seems that I am not to get wish 😢 I really need to find the genie lamp 😂🧞‍♂️
Les go the classic intro
"I'm gonna miss matpat" can you stop being so depressed writing the same copy/paste comments over and over and over and over and over again ?Will anyone talk about the video??
There's 1 name I need to say Scott Cawthon
I have already lost all hope...
Please don't do this Please matpat
bro you had to quit on my brthday
I'm gonna miss seeing a gt notification and being so excited for Matpat to do the intro. It's not the same...
T
WE WILL MISS YOU
Seeing the old intro made me cry, happy and sad
Is matpat going to go back through all the classic intros please let that be the case it would be such a brilliant way to end things as they began
omg I've missed that classic intro so much!
why is this one of your last
watching these knowing they're the last few videos in which we see that dumb picture of matt hits different man
If thats how Toms gunna host.... I may be okay with him assuming the reigns of the channel
Ban ban is such a fever dream
We’re gonna miss you matpat also your the best part of my childhood :)
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Yeah We’re Gonna miss you buddy
Mat pls don’t leave
Goodbye mat 😢 (if a bot replies to this then matpat will become immortal)
I wonder if MatPat is gonna change the intro to an older intro every video and on the final video we’re gonna see the first Game Theory intro that would honestly be pretty cool.
I will be thoroughly disappointed, if the final theory isn't Undertale, or FNAF  MatPats 2 biggest villains
the intro, its been so long
This video makes me want to make a wish that wants to make me a video  like twice.
Im gonna miss him, but at least we have until march 9th❤
Just bringing back the old intro deserves a 👍
why would you ever NOT use the classic intro?
I'm gonna miss you so much matpat   P.s the og intro hit hard 🔥

Thank you MatPat for bring me childhood memories and ruining childhoods with all your amazing theories

I love the old intro
Neat analysis video! Thanks so much for uploading!
Your back mappat
Ah yes. The classic intro.goodbye❤️

MatPat's last episode should be an in-person interview with Scott and have to answer any Fnaf questions. MatPat deserves it
Its okay. You’ve been doing this for 13 years. Goodbye king 🤴
We've got two months left, cherish what we can get from him while he can make.

Matpat, you were my childhood, and you made it the best childhood, and I thank you for that❤❤
The classic intro hit so hard
I miss the classic intro song
Pl. dont go then my hart will be empty
The music has always gotten me so hyped and I'm happy it's (briefly) coming back.
We’re going to miss you, no matter what.
Were gonna miss you matpat, F for a legend
Matt you're like a dad to me dude don't leave!!
I miss the classic intro so much this is just a huge bash of nostalgia.
What if in one day Matpat Will come back
That's a 1992 Opel Frontera. Not sure if that's lore significant, just had the urge to point it out.
Something that makes me just a little mad is how on the steam page (I’m not sure if it says this anymore but) it said there are no new friends to make, only enemies. But apparently we’re going to need the help of “the surgeon” so either they are making this story up on the go, or the surgeon isn’t going to be friendly...
😭
Matpat well miss you. But also tell Tom to keep the old intro.
THE CLASSIC INTRO HITS HARD THO WE LOVE YOU MAT
🫡🫡🫡
Didn’t realize that I missed the old theme song so bad
We need a sonic theory
Dam
The nostalgia from the  intro
Gonna miss your theories and you personally so much 😊
Please do shorts wars season 2. You literally predicted the boss would take off the mask and season 2.
HE ADDED THE BLUE LETS GOOOOOOO
seeing the classic intro coming back finally after like I dont know 3, 4 years? is amazing im gonna miss you matpat
The old intro brings back so many memories
Nostalgia hurts 😭😭
I wonder what the last nine theories would be?
You were the biggest part of my childhood
I already knew it was nostalgia year, but now seeing like at least 4 youtubers use their og intros for their year in recap, or ahem, garten of banban theory, just proves it to me. ahhh nostalgia year, how i'll be nostalgic for you
that intro made me feel emotional. After watching matpat for so long you saw the evolutions of the intros but it was like a blast from the past
Can’t believe he brought the classic intro back for this.. wow.
I don't care about garden of banban at all but this is one of Mat's last videos so I will give my full attention
Gonna miss you MatPat❤
Seeing the old intro made me so happy omg
I am going to die when these theorys are done and Matpat's gone. Im gonna go back and watch every theory Matpat did.
I will miss you mat 💕 but this is for the best 💕 glad your focusing on the most important things in life ❤️
Thank you matpat
Loving the revamped old intro
I liked when the classic intro started
Mat pat need to pull a Tom Brady fr

Classic intro just hits different ♥️
You will be missed 😔
Im so sad that Matpat is Leaving but atleast he is going to stay in the Fnaf Movie forever

Pizaa...

helluva boss
I'm gonna miss you, MatPat, I'll try to welcome Tom with open arms!
I’m still crying 😭 you will be missed 😔
We'll miss you mat I love you
Game theory
Flinn is so valid for not wanting to think
For every theory left there should be a different older intro
😢
this is one of the last
I have a theory, what if there is lore to the game theory channel and matpat wasnt the first theorists, they’remaking theorys of other stuff to draw the attention away from them. There is something more to this
I’m gonna miss you matpat..
The classic intro brings me back 🥹🥹
Thank you true king
Really gonna miss you guys ❤
The final count down has started
The og intro... I gona ser ALL the fnaf vídeos again one day

Ok
Mat pat can you please make a superliminal theory it's a interesting game you don't have to just a idea. Also I'm gonna miss you so much man ill st ill watch game theory even if your not on it.
Here's a question why is it Garten of banban shouldn't it be garden of banban bc Garten is German?
THE CLASSSIC INTRO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The last one...
We all gonna miss you matpat
Geez, is Tom going to leave as well? He looks about 3 years younger than you Matt.
Matpat could you like do 1 video each year so we wont miss you so much?
if the last theory is not fnaf we riot. Goodbye matpat you will be missed.
As your final videos of theorizing go through, you might wanna consider retroing your intros. Something like going back to your old intros, but fill it in with new consoles.
And so the countdown begins.......
Oh my god the old intro hit so hard
MATPAT IS GONE, BUT THE INTRO IS BACK
hi matpat will there be Walten files theory or cg live PLS RESPOND ITS IMPORTANT FOR WALTEN FILES COMUNITY
Thank you MatPat for all the amazing theories across all your channels over the years. It's been incredible and we are all going to miss you.
Imma unsubsribe when matpat leaves
Matpat needs to make one more Fnaf vid before goes
Also I love the fact how matpat is so chill and acts like he is just making a normal video.
the intro hit as hard as my dads belt
The old intro les go

OMFG THE CLASSIC INTRO
He's handing things over to Tom
I don’t even like garten of banban I just wanted to hear matpat’s voice

9 theories left. 9 times. I don't think anybody can take you leaving. We're gonna miss you.
Yeah, love that intro!!
Aaaah the intro after the notice. Man it hurts
I loved the old intro. Love to see it return!
Never expected to see Peso Pluma in a trending topic list outside Mexico
Majoras mask flashbacks, also really this game for one of the last theories MatPat will do?
the classic intro gave me so much nostalgia, the times when that intro was still used felt so recent, I still cannot believe matpat is gonna leave from game-theory, i fell like I'm losing a really important figure In my life
ok but i forgot that the classic intro went THIS hard
To anyone sad about Mat leaving, he isn’t leaving the channels. He will still be on the writing team, just not the host.
Why do you need to go 🥺😭
We'll miss you MatPat🤍 You made my childhood, and probably many others 😭🤍
THE CLASSIC INTRO 😭😞🥺
That classic intro made me shed a tear of joy, thank you MatPat
The original theory opening with all 4 quadrants filled was amazing, and I can only hope that you will do more of them.
everybody will miss you matpat😭   Also I missed the classic intro
Last 9 theory 1 is garten of ban ban

Imma miss mattpatt. He was there when I had nobody. Watched his videos when I cried to cheer me up. GOD we all will miss yah Matt
The art in this video is really nice. I’m still kinda annoyed that garten of banban is one of the last matpat videos.
Matpats leaving this is a nightmare
YOOOO THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!! music to my ears.
And so the countdown begins.
that intro fit different now
I'm going to slap my head because matpat is leaving YouTube
The old intro 🥺
lets go
Æ
I’m pretty upset that your leaving and I still have t seen the video but I heard of it. And I really reallllly love when you used the old intro that was nostalgic and I loved it ❤❤❤ we will miss you so much 😢😢❤😢❤❤😢❤😢❤😢
Really hope one of the final theories is the conclusion of petscop. Probably wishful thinking though
Imma miss u 😭
Ayo slow down bro 😭
better end it off with a blast,matpat.
we will keep theorizing in your honour matpat 🥹
Watching the old intro feels like that one ratatouille meme( you know the one)
Me here never having heard of this and only here because it one of the final 9 theorys:
Goodbye matpat 😢
I hope we get a playlist of your old theories, I wanna watch them all
Bro dose anyone else remember the sans is Ness theory
Ive been waiting for matpat to do a theory about madness combat
Your are my first YouTuber I ever saw it will be sad to see that your not the last I will ever see 😢😢😢😢😢😢
"We'll meet again,don't know where,don't know when,all I know is that we'll meet again some sunny day"
Thank You for everything you've done for me I grew up in a bad environment youre made me feel happy
but that's just a theory, a game theory
a cool thing they could do for the final video is a collage of all the game theory intros form the first to the current
thats not the first intro
rest in peace
That is the best intro in my opinion
If he quits then my life is ruined
That intro is so nostalgic
Wish they would also bring back the classic film theory intro😢
day one of asking for overwatch vs tf2 deadlocked episode part 2
He's back😄
May a legend rest
15:07 You were trying to cross the border, right?
Welp I deppereso espresso cuz of mat leaving But its ok I hope mat lives happily wipping that nae nae and being happy  Edit: LADIES AND GENTELMEN THESE ARE THE FACTS AS I UNDER STAND THEM BOTS/TROLLS HAVE STARTED FLOODING THIS COMMENT SECTION FOR CLOUT AND PUBLIC SHAMING  PLEASE ARM YOUR SELF WITH A:  I ASKED + MATPATS CONTENT  IS BETTER THEN MINE!  AND I HOPE MATPAT WILL RETURN!

You don’t want to know how much I was ready for that classic intro
We'll miss you after these nine theories pepaw matpat
we all gonna miss you matpat...❤
Thanks mat for creating my childhood
We’ll miss you MatPat….
I was gonna guess that the mysterious mascot in the dream and the human parent has a connection, like the DNA used for the mascot came from us. So, in both dream and game we play a version of 'us'.
Right on nostalgia
Seeing the classic intro with all four colors was so cool!!!!
It been so long since the og Intro
L L Loore😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
:(
Sad
Why does this have to be one of the videos 😢
8 to go
WHY DID BANBAN HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE LAST THEORIES?
We are going to miss matpat
Were gonna miss matpat but side note, why are there so many bots?
I’m gonna miss this 🥺
What about the classic classic intro
We'll miss you MatPat
Finally THE RIGHT INTRO IM SO HAPPY RN
Bro get these bots out of mf comments talking bout they’re content and they got one video with bots watching his video
MATPAT NOOOO
IM SO BEYOND EXCITED THAT THIS OS ONE OF THE LAST MATPAT THEORIES
I just realized the meta humor of it taking twice as long for the recent Banban installment to release and them skipping a number on the release cycle. It still ends up being 1 release every 2 months technically lol
Ima be crying when sign says one remaining
I'll miss you so much matpat. You helped me through my toughest times when I needed you the most
Goodbye matpat I’ll miss you
What about the classic classic intro
I was not expecting the classic intro my heart my heart😢
everyday i waking up screaming after finding out mattpatt is old enough to potentially be my father.  i thought this man was like 30 😟
I am gonna miss you Matpat... And thx for the intro, we will cherish it like an anthem...❤
Matpat I barely watched you, but you did make me laugh sometimes ❤
We are gonna miss u😢
MatPat, you never ruined childhoods, you made them. You will be missed.
Ive missed the classic intro so much.
I’LL MISS YOU SO MUCH! YOUR THE BEST THEORIST EVER!
yay for classic intro
bro the ending with the explosion got me
Im so glad we got to see the old intro again
One of the last videos and it's on Garten of Banban 6, I find that really funny
I love the intro so much
We’re gonna miss you so much😢…
im sad
Actually you being the perfect child in the dream sequences makes sense. Right under the plot note talking about Zorphius, it mentions that he could only sleep so of long, meaning that he sleeps a lot. And when each of the dream sequences start, we are always just waking up in them.
The original intro 😭😭😭
I am going to this matpat so much
My god I started tearing up the moment I saw the theory counter 😢
I’m not gonna cry watching the old intro, I’m not, you can’t make me I refuse!
The intro 🤩🥰🤟
Ruining your childhood from 2011 till 2024😢…. Bye
Since matpat is gone then who will cover for him?
Will miss you Marist 😢
We’ll miss you a lot MatPat!
Why is he going away from YouTube we need you, Fnaf needs you we need answers
You are literal child hood I watched you for years and now you leave but we will miss you so much 😢 and you need to make more then 9 last videos pls matpat❤❤😢😢
the intro :')
Why couldn’t it be anything other then gobb like bro-
Eight more vids until matpat retires youtube :(
We’ll miss you MatPat
We'll miss you matpat
do a raldi's crackhouse theiry its kind of dark
We are gonna miss you MatPat! The theories won’t be the same without you
I miss the old intro 🥰😭
8:19 was that supposed to be "the board or investors", as (within the given context) investors or stockholders would basically be the same thing? Or is it meant as a combination of the different stakeholders (i.e. workers, society, investors, customers etc.)?
"Hey you, your finally awake."  Hmmm, I really hope that referenced skyrim, just jokingly
We’re going to miss you dad pat
F In Chat 😭 Bro don’t leave please 😭
The OG intro got me in the feels
So sad banban is one of his last theories
He announces he’s gonna retire from YouTube and then he makes a Garten of Banban Theory    😭😭😭
That intro dude…I needed it…
Imma missbyou
No, i Refuse
Dude.. I’m gonna miss you soooooooo much, thank you for all that you’ve done for me
Matpat, I’ve grew up watching you and your channels, I will miss you hosting the videos but I understand you’re situations. thank you for all you have done for us the viewers.❤
Love you, Matpat. Gonna miss you.

CHOOOO CHOOOOO CHARLES
;-; the only thing I can say is ;-;
Seeing that old intro was nice.
I'm going to miss you mattpat. I will forever rewatch all of your old vids.
I get the feeling that garten of Banban started out with intentions as a scam, but soon became something with actual care put into it.
hope the new guy is as hilarious as matpat.
whatever his last game theory is, he should pull out the  classic intro. as in the original.
I BLAME TOM SCOTT

I'm not skipping the intro ever again.
OG INTRO LETS GOOOO
I'm half expecting FNaF games to stop being created now once MatPat retires
I was NOT ready for the return of the old intro 😭
I'm surprised he decided for Garden of Ban Ban to be one of his last theories
Did you guys audibly say "yeah boi" when the old intro played
Tear runs down my face as I understand this is one of his last theories... We will miss you
im gonna miss matpat so much
How come y'all stopped using the classic intro?

We will miss you matpat
This intro bought back so much memories 🥲 u will be missed theory king!❤️
That intro stabbed me in my soul.
We’re gonna miss you..
Rip matpat
I don't think banban is evil
I can't believe GrandPat is leaving us with some British guy!😢
I feel like Matt should curse for the rest of the videos idk it would be funny
I remember when the channel only had like 14 videos and I’d cycle through them until the next video came out, now may pay only has 9 videos left 😭🫶🏻
I definitely miss you but Tbh the new coming host is definitely feel like just a matpat just different appearance and voice but but he will never replace you completely
While I know all of us, your fans, are gonna be sad. I'm sure we all understand why you're leaving. This was an awesome run, and we'll all miss you.
The exploding at the end was personal
My heart😭
imma miss you matpat
This feels like the countdown for Majoras Mask but worse since Matpat is leaving instead of link being dead
We have things on Spotify, but I wonder if Theory Media will ever reach YouTube Music's Podcasts. I hope it does, because I am planning on switching from Spotify to YouTube Music.
Man, I’ve been watching this guy for like… 3 years? 4 years? I don’t know but I’ve been watching him for a WHILE and him leaving with this??? It just cracks me up.
He will be missed
I am kinda ok with mat leaving but if tom changes the theme song I will ask his address
😭😭😭
So sad that he had made his cameo in the fnaf movie that shows the true peak of his career. What an amazing dude I’m gonna break down 😭
Goodbye mat
Thank You MatPat

I'm thinking he's gonna do the next intro each theory
Could you do something about the bots? Like an auto mod or something?
We will all miss you matpat, You basically helped me get into fnaf to
Game Theory will always be the best part of my life. I'll never forget you, MatPat!
" Dont cry because is over, Smile because it happened.. "
I hope on film theory its SW s2
Stinger seems to have lots of connections to Gnosis from Mythic Ocean. They both have a goal of freedom in their respective games, having knowledge beyond what the players would expect of someone in their situation. They also seem to be a guide to the player, not like a tutorial guide, but more of telling the player on what they should or shouldn’t do. Who knows, Stinger might even be seeking some kind of power to breakout that only we can provide.
The theory king is 8 theory’s away from passing down his crown.
Do colab with hbomb
TOM? Why not Fuhnaff? JOHN????
im gonna cry when MatPat makes his last video, im gonna miss him so so much
Unsubbing when matpat leaves 😭
I've missed that intro so much.
OG game theory intro hits hard
Classic intro! Even though matt is leaving, this does put a smile on my face. Thank you for keeping me grounded :'> just hurts to lose my intetnet 'grandpa' right after the other ones.
Pls don't leave i will miss you so much 😢😢
nice video MatPat. You are my favorite You Tuber
THE CLASSIC INTRO HAD STYLE THEORY???
Nostalgia 1000 on the intro

One video down nine more to go am I right everybody😭😭😭😭😭
Poppy Playtime chapter 3 better release in February
Imma miss you Matpat! Thank you for putting the classic intro! Got me in my feels again 😭😭💕💕🙏🙏
Knowing Matpat, I was curious if the thumbnail was gonna say "A-banban-don All Hope!" lol
I want you back ☹️
The old intro‘s so nostalgic.
Every video now is joy but also pain in realising the number of theories is ticking down
I can’t watch game theory with a different voice it has to be Matt’s voice, I think game theory will fall off because of this :/
this is a banban certified day
We all will miss you matpat, not one of us will forget you.
2/9
Your theory’s are not then same now
Thanks for all the memories ❤
happy for you matpat!!
He’s gonna do an early April fools :,(
Don't be sad it ended be happy it happened   We will miss you
My sister likes watching this game and i hate it so much.
9 more theories who’s Tom

That wasn’t the classic intro I, I want the CLASIC intro
I WILL MISS YOU MATPAT!!!
Egg

I'm going to miss you friend. . .
Couldn’t even watch this without tearing up! Im so proud of you Mat, thank you for making mine and many others childhoods amazing🥺
Matpat, thanks for all your hard work on this channel, we’re gonna miss you so much😢
That intro is the Definition of "Ballin" but at what cost"
Bro's on his Machiavellian horror villain arc
Hey mat can you a make a last ddlc theroy
Only 8 left……
9 words 9 words these nine words are his catch phrase what are they? You must know, for you are a theorist so you can know.
One video down 10 more to go, I’m all right everybody😭😭😭
14:32 huh. I always assumed from my own theories that because of the notes talking about "too many kids" and the ballpit being closed, i assumed the weight from all the kids at once collapsed the ballpit causing the kids to fall into the lower floors.
10 years into the future, this will bring me so much nostalgia
Matpat please don't leave  I planted to do a arg just because of you.
I’m gonna miss you so much Matt Pat
We will mess you bro
I’m still gonna watch these but it’s just not gonna feel the same without matpat
THE OLD INTRO IS BACK YEAHHHH
I'm going to miss you matpat but the old intro mad me cry again
Not missing another game theory from here to May
Here’s hoping MatPat uses progressively older and older intros in each episode. :) Thank you for all the memories, Matt.
Hey dude only 9 theories left soo... PLEASE DON'T POST SO FAST. MISS MATPAT  The bottom says "ruining your childhood since 2011" so thats not true
i hope MattPat can genuinly enjoy his "retirement". but while other old folks talk about war and the great depression, MattPat will talk to his children and grandchildren some crazy stories bout videogame- and movie-lore. poor kiddos 😛
Hey man we're gonna miss you thank for the classic intro
Matpat we are really going to miss you  are like a dad to me😢❤
you have no idea the amount of joy I experienced when matpat brought upon himself to utter the phrase we are bringing back the classic intro
If you didn’t notice it in the OG intro, it was changed to have style theories blue shine in it
NOT THE 'NINE THEORIES REMAINING'
Is it just me or does this sound like aot
we will miss you but never lost *pulls out a grave* well-
OH THE CLASsIC INTRO MY HEART
The original theme song hits hard
Love you Matpat you’ll be missed thanks for the memories.
I am gonna miss you matpat
Man matpat leaving is mad Took all the old theories for granted
Me: Sad that MatPat is quiting  Also me when the original intro starts playing: *+ 100 Strength*
Thank you for absolutely everything, MatPat. Truly.
On the horizon the end

We got the intro back baby!
I ASKED + MY CONTENT IS WAY WORSE I DON’T HAVE ANY CONTENT + I HOPE MATPAT ENJOYS RETIREMENT
Please mat don't go 😭
Im gonna miss him. But matpat, really garden of banban? I would get mad but theres not any games left so i dont really blame him honestly
Classic intro hits harder knowing that Matpat is leaving g
Not me tearring up at the theme song 😢
1 out of 10 more vids till hes gone😭😭😭
Imagine the VERY FIRST game theory video or intro as the last theory
I’d love to see one more updated version of the intro
Another legend has made a mark in the history of the internet
please don't leave us please Markiplier and a few others are the only ones left that i like
Is matpat just going to upload garten of banban content before he leaves? 💀
OMG THE INTROOOO
YEEEAH CLASSIC INTRO MUSIC
I never saw this
Matpat is basically my 2nd dad
Love you matpat ♥️
Matpat better end his final theory with like a orchestral rendition of the game theory music
We Will Miss You
Thank you for everything Mat (even though one of your last videos was in freaking garten of ban ban jk) I can’t wait for the last 8 videos 🙂

Matpat is leaving as the host of GT before "Project Libitina" came out.
I dont care i never watched him im gonna miss him very much. You were the idol of many succesful youtubers just like you. We will never forget you. So long my friend. You will be missed and never forgoten by any of us.😭😭😭
banban... he has been released
Are you still going to be in some videos
YES, I'VE MISSED THE INTRO
BRO THE classic game intro had me vibing
so what your saying is that garten of banban and nier have the same general idea behind their protagonists
He was our childhood. He also ruined said childhood
Our legend……goodbye.
We are going to miss you Matpat I used to watch you alot
YEEEEAAAHHHH I MISSED THE CLASSIC INTRO SO MUCH
Please do little nightmares
My only hope is that the intros will get older as the clock ticks down, eventually landing on the first intro for the final (or second-to-final) theory.
8 more....

MattPatt. My childhood dies on March 9, 2024, but hey, That’s just a theory. 🥲
Nostalgia intro goes so hard
Theory: i think the reason choo choo charles appears is because the main character in choo choo charles is the main character in garten of banban
Ompf
The one game able to beat Mattpat was not fnaf it was garten of banban
Genuinely, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the theories you've presented through the many years. Everyone will miss you and I am no exception, Thank you so much Matpat [: <3

Do pacific rim
Bro its so said to see him leave big bye from the yt community
Thank you for the triumphant return of the old intro! It may not be forever, and it may be a herald of the end of the "MatPat Era" of GT, but I'm happy that you're pulling out all the stops and going out on *your* terms!

You should make an fn theory because there is so much to cover and o think you would love all the lore these days
He did the intro, he did the thing
One of the last theories being garten of banban is....i dont have words
gosh that countdown hurts but i know it has to be shown but love seeing the old intro <3 that was always my favorite one :)
Maybe, just maybe, we'll get the finale of Petscop before Matpat leaves. Please don't forget about Petscop, Game Theory.
The amount of bots is ridiculous 💀💀💀   Btw we'll miss you MatPat
“Remember when this was just about finding our kids? What happened to that ?” Ohh silly matpat it’s never JUST about finding kids with these indie games
We will miss you man

That song is so nostalgic I’ve missed it a lot you should still keep it after you leave it’ll be like a small piece of you is still here
You will be highly missed MatPat.

He would have to be the one person that got me into this theory within games I remember one of the first ones I saw was the omega mart series it makes me sad to see him pass on the channel 2011 of November on the 18 I was born 2011 was when he started game theorist I watched him when I was about 3-4 Now I’m 12
Matpat I’m gonna miss you you are my childhood and to you Tom gl man I will still be watching and supporting Edit: matpat before you leave can you do a theory of Genshin Impact
I love the OG intro. Glad to see a magnificent send off.
Matpat on your final theory, say, “You want the lore? Go and get it! I left it all there!” Then the narrator says “and so begins the great age of theorists!”
I still can’t believe MatPat is leaving
I'm gonna miss you matpat
This is going to be very difficult when matpat leaves we will never forget you
CLASSIC INTRO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GAME THEORYYYYY

I miss that intro and going to miss matpat
I’m not sure if you saw it Mat, but in a different game (I forget what it’s called, but it is a game where you are going through a lab run by a shark football mascot), Stinger Flynn makes a brief cameo in a small baby pool looking thing. Just thought I’d throw that out there.
BRO THE OLD INTRO
Quoting Malcolm in the middle: "Get out of there Charles, That's not your family"

We’ll miss you matpat, my first ever video of you was the first five nights at Freddy’s theories that you did.
I didn’t click on the video initially but saw Preview with the 9 theories remaining and somehow knew it was going to have the majora’s mask sound.
I hope poppy playtime 3 comes out before matpat leaves
My childhood wouldn’t be the same without you we will miss you soooooo much thank you for 13 years of awesome entertainment

Oh, I know why but come on Musi every Youtubers dream will not dream, but all the Youtubers I watch most of them watch you when they was younger. Why does why?
13 years of happiness, 13 years of fun, 13 years of theories, 13 years of puns, Matpat, a legend, a myth of himself, Is ending his YouTube career, the one we all loved.  MatPat, if you were to read this poem i have made, I wish you well, and the happiest of days, It is only right to repay what has been given, And we couldn't thank you enough for helping us all feel like children.  Although it may be ending, The channel and all, There will always be moments, That you could never forget, Moments that mean everything, Moments that are priceless, Without fail and without wrong,  You have never stopped doing what you have always loved.  -Goodbye to a legend.    In all seriousness, we will miss you, and we always will..
9 week before the end
😢
I needed that intro back, it touched my soul 😂
Matttttpattttt😢😢😭😭
We will never forget you
Thanks for everything Mat.
I'll be darned.  You actually made sense out of what appeared to be random garbage.  I am not yet convinced that this is what the Euphoric Brothers had in mind, but if it isn't they just might incorporate it.  Cheers!

I absolutely love how late stage Mattpat is completely mask off. Not holding back any punches.
The old introoo
Gotta cherish these last few videos

My Birthday Tomorrow
The intro has been updated to represent the 4 theorist channels

Why Garten of Ban Ban as one of your final theories.... why a bad game.
Commenting until the fun ends: BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY
😢😢😢
12:51 thanks for mentioning rockit music

Hey What if we just say that the bus is Gus the bus from choo choo charles.
This is going to be a tough next few weeks. We gonna miss you so much Matpat. But you will still be in our hearts and behind the scenes. 🥺
I'm not crying it's just raining 😭
I missed the old intro so much, seeing it with the complete colors is beautiful
The end is near all i feel is sadness and nostalgia from the intro
Wahhhhhhhhhh😢
i'm sad because matpat is leaving  yes i know that's pretty much everyones' reaction but i'm still gonna miss him
Gonna miss this guy
Im gonna miss u so much matpat…:(
We're gonna miss you so much matpat, you were a huge part of my childhood, thank you.
tether
:)
Yes we will rill mis you
We will miss you legend!
At least nine theories  more
Genuinly, I think everyone should just focus on the theories instead of constantly saying we're gonna miss him. We surely will, but we should actually engage with the last few theories he puts out rather than expressing our sadness in every comment section.
That old intro..it's so nostalgic, and to think I'm the same age as this ol' channel! It hurts to let go guys, but do remember, it's just a theory...a *game.* Theory..we love you, matpat
The car representing freedom has to be the most american thing ever
Gonna miss ya
bro
I just realized that the bus attack us in dream and took one of garden of ban ban character is gus the bus.
Matpat is my childhood I cried for hours when I saw the vidio😢
Why 🤔
1. Gonna miss you matpat, never really commented much before, but been here watching since the start. Love you. Wish the best going forward 2. Really was hoping for a fifth channel based on the trophy in the middle of the GT logo, being something like 'complete theory' where you or your staff go over the confirmed facts and how much your previous theories matched up
"Hello Internet, and welcome to NOSTALGIA and GREIF"
LETS GO!! THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!!! THANK YOU MATPAT!
Gotta love the old intro
Its nice seeing the classic intro again :)
The goosebumps from the OG Intro
9 days until the party…
ban ban and stinger flynn are almost like an old divorced couple that still love each other
CLASSIC INTRO!
WAHHHH😭 9 theories guys!
bye
only matpat can make me watch a banban video
MatPat you are the best you youTuber I’ve never seen in my life you are my childhood hero
Woah the nostalgia from that intro
I've missed that intro, and I'm happy to see the updated logo 🙏😭
I’m sad but I’m so glad your taking a break, always felt a little sad when you joked about being up all night and not sleeping. So glad you’ll still be involved a little so your personality will shine in the channels you created.
Long live a YouTube legend
Only OGS remeber this intro 0:21 👇if you rember it and will miss MatPat
8 more 😥
the true theory is whether or not we're really in the darkest timeline with Garten of banban still here....
Seeing that intro brought so much nostalgia
I turned up my volume to max and replayed the intro a couple times.
We gonna miss you matt
NOT THE COUNT DOWN☹️
I just realized what will happen to that spicy food eating you did every year?
the intro hit way different
We will miss you matpat 😢 Honestly game theory without you mat is for me nothing 😢
I went to my 5 stages of grief. Denial Anger Bargaining Depression  And ecceptance. We're going to miss matpat and his MUSIC MAN and THE LOOOORRRRREE line
The grin on my face seeing the intro again was UNMATCHED.

Intro fire as usual 🔥🔥🔥
I'm gonna miss your video Matpat
Goodbye
I don’t think someone pointed this out there was a update with Welcome Home…….      But we will always miss u😁
If he continues doing theories like this there won't be a legacy left 💀
Woo hoo! We missed you matpat!
Gdby <3
We're back down memory lane. Goodbye Matpat I'll try to enjoy the theories as much as I can
Bro what am i supposed to watch when he quits?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
How can we be the "failed child" if we can clearly see him in the backround in many dreams?
im gonna miss mat so much this sucks
Shoot! I really hoped his final videos would be just him being super confused about fnaf
I really needed to see that classic intro, I’ll miss your videos but thank you for all you’ve done
I'll miss ya matpat
I'm sad matpat is leaving, but he has a few more videos for us
seeing this video after the goodbye video just dont feel the same anymore
I haven't looked at anything from these games since the first one released. I decided I was gonna watch the last videos with Mathew even though I haven't really consistently watched game theory in probably 6 or 7 years, sort of an respect thing for. But man that opening statement about kangaroo pouch skybeams or whatever is uh... huh? I do wanna say that the last game theory thing I've ever watched before now was the gtlive stream you did on breath of the wild when that game first released (so yeah I guess about 6 years,) and that stream immediately made me go out and buy the game for my Wii U and fall in love with Zelda all over ago, so thanks MatPat.
😭
We're gonna miss you Matthew Patthew
this defo feels like the last three doctor who specials with david tennant but it’s matpats last… 9 specials… theories- yeah no doesn’t roll off the tongue as well
Playing this game is like being on LSD
He's not gonna make theories anymore...
I've never played the game, but as a Skyrim enjoyer, the "Hey you, you're finally awake" was amazing.
Day 157 of asking for a Red Dead Redemption 2 Theory
Honestly, I was stunned when he first announced his departure as host of the channels. My first thought was view counts would go down, but the more I watch his last appearances and think about those taking over, the more hopeful I become. I will miss seeing MatPat in each video but am reassured he will still be around and involved.
Gdby <3
Abanbandon all hope....
dont go!
Matpatt is a legend
We are really miss you matpat
CLASSIC INTROOOOO
9 THEORIES LEFT LETS SAY GOODBYE :(❤❤ Also I quit for you btw- since you are quitting I quit
The nostalgia from intro

Technically we have 36 theories left because 9 theories across four channels is 36

We're gonna miss u matpat and also really missed that intro too

It feels surreal to see the classic intro with all four colored lights on.

The cycle shifts. This is the end and the beginning. Maybe you will watch maybe you won't. But the stage is about to be set They will dance. Goodbye, MatPat, I wish you the best.
What better game to start the farewell tour 😂❤
of course he dedicates one of his final theories to garten of PEAK
I’m really gonna miss him
we will miss you matpat
guys, i understand its sad he's leaving, but let's just enjoy the few episodes he has left and spread joy in the comments.
"Dad, what are you watching?"  "..."  "Dad?"  "You wouldn't get it. You wouldn't get it at all"  "But it's just a video!"  "A video that made the last parts of our childhood..."
Matpat was family, even though I don't know him personally, I feel like I'm losing family with him gone Also that intro music, ahhhh
Mad pat I I’ll never have a chance. See you on the other side.
Man, this really is a tough pill to swallow, each and every single one of us is gonna miss you matpat
Wow, the classic intro but they changed the bottom right color with blue instead of the og green
The INTROOOO!
Man I hoping that the day matpat is gone will the the day his son takes over
:)
The og!! Heck yeah
Has it really been a year since the first banban came out? That's a little crazy.
I hope for him to make one final FNAF theory video ❤

I doubt Banban is at fault. It’s overall be Sir Dadadoo and the rest of the Naughty Ones.
The classic
his last theory has to be fnaf🙏
Your retirement is a really wierd feeling for me, im really going to miss someone who has been there since i was drooling on my moms ipad, but im really excited to see how the others will take the wheel!  Much love big man ❤
Mat: where’s our missing kid? Internet: we’re gonna miss you, kid.
Rick Ashtley isn’t in the mirror anymore. Why is it monika?!

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE
YEAHHHHH OLD INTRO BACKKKK
You were lots of people’s childhood, so I’m happy
This is nice video I hope more videos come out
How did this series turn from a Poppy Playtime ripoff to a horror-themed soap opera 😂 (also goodbye matpat, you're a legend😢)
When matpat leaves, the channel will die.
Bro made me feel like 7 again just cuz of the intro
Sub 1h
I do wonder if each episode, the intro reverts to an older version, but anyway, we are going to miss him.
The Classic Intro!!! Ahhhh my heart!
Matt pat I love u I will always be in my heart ur a legend ❤
Man, matpat we are all gonna miss you
It’s not going to be the same as it was
So what happens if we was the perfect child and that they tried to get our child as it’s the closest thing they had to a perfect child as we are grown up
I am going miss you so much 😢❤
We are all going to miss you so much matpat thanks for everything
THE INTRO! 🥳
Ain't no way y'all wasted a theory on ban ban
Wasn't his last video supposed to be on march,?
Can you do one more FNAF video before you leave
Does anyone know who made the artwork of the Banban characters? I’m just curious.
Do not waste your last videos on garten of banban
The classic intro brought me back 5 years ago
Thankyou for everything  Matpat we are gonna miss you.
Thank u matpat 2009-2024
Goodbye MatPat. Thank you for everything.
I’m going to miss you so much, it’s nice to see the happy and up beat tone of the video😊
There's so much mat has taught me and in such interesting ways that i will always look up to matpat and his team ❤
The classic intro made me cry

I love you matpat but I cant watch this without being sad. I don't think I'll watch future gt episodes because you won't be there. So this is goodbye you done this generation wonders
The old intro brought me back for a second just to drag me back to reality
The classic intro is a nice way to bring it all to an end
We will miss you matpat❤️
YouTube kids slop content

CLASSIC INTROOOOOOOO

Why ban ban 🤨
We’re gonna miss you man
He got me so interested in the banban lore that I forgot he's retiring
I will miss you were my childhood
bro should've done his last video on fnaf
We well never forget you matpat allso inlike the art f te character looks like there meatcanyon
Unus auns
Nobody is even gonna enjoy watching these knowing that Matpat is leaving
Love you MatPat! As a first name Patrick, you are in the Patrick club for life brother!
I missed the classic game theory intro so much
Since i ran out of my antidepressants i wil now cry. Gonna miss you matpat ❤
Im so fcking sad i cant even focus on the context
ill miss mister patmat so friggin much
We love you 🫶❤️
Why garten of ban ban of all things 😭
There's nothing more american than "car is freedom, bus is control"
While you are listening to this (King rameses) Pathar lauta doo is after me 😭 (from courage the cowardly dog)  Hopefully i can save myself
Note about Nabnab - the mind controlled (naughtified?) version of Nabnab we see isn't actually Nabnab, but Nabnaleena. Its likely we'll see him pop up again opposing the naughty ones.  edit, finished the video! This is a great theory! Presents a lot of great points, hadn't even considered that the dream sequences could've had you viewing them from the perspective of a third party!
I remember the times, the days long ago, before the cold set in and the theories still flowed ...
This is one of his last videos why
It’s sad to see MatPat leaving as the main host but I wish him all the best in his other endeavors and send an early welcome to Tom being the host of Game Theory.
Will all miss you matpat :(
DON’T LEAVE MATPAT 😭😭😭
The OG intro! 😭 That hit hard.
Hey I love you Matpat, I'll never forget you, You were always my second favorite Yptuber, You always fill my freetime with theories of fun
It was fun mat pat yo videos hit different
Nine more theories
matpat is a best
Please don’t leave us
I remember the first vid I watch from this dude was a bill cipher Gravity falls theory. Imma miss ya a lot 😢
I’m going to miss you MatPat
Hope you raise your kid just as well as how you raised millions of others, Mat 🥲
My little cousin  plays this game 😭😭😭😭
Early for the ocasiom
We are Gonna miss you soo much
We will miss you matpat our childhood we love u matpat
I'm going to miss you Matpat  Enjoy your retirement and take care
The intro brought back memories buried long long ago and it left me in tears
YES YES THE INTRO IS BACK BABYYYYY
Only 9 left 😢😭😔 Old intro nostalgia
The countdown has stared 9
you are everything man, thank you
The theory countdown has officially begun! Altho knowing MatPat won't participate on screen in GT, I feel like we're in great hands with all the other theorists. Gonna definitely miss MatPat, but Tom is definitely going to crush it and i'm sure he will fill in the presenting job quite fast.
OH MY GOD THE 4 COLOURS IN THE RING IN THE OG INTRO

the last theory NEEDS TO BE A FNAF ONE
You’re back
Hey matpat, your getting attacked by uttp
i’ll miss you matpat. you will forever be my childhood.
Come on one of your last theory’s is a ban ban theory😭
It would be really cool if each episode just slowly goes backwards with the intros, until the very last episode uses one of the ORIGINAL intros.
YES FINALLY the original intro😭😭❤️❤️
we will all miss you
It’s nice to see the old intro back with all 4 quadrants filled in
guys! lets remember matpat is not completly leaving and he may not be the voice or host of the videos but hes still with us just taking the back seat
I’m genuinely surprised that Banban really made it this far despite the previous situation it’s been in. But besides that, we’re gonna miss you.
Mat Pat in next video of The Film Theory can you please do a review about criticism of Garden of Banban by Core or Gabs (Brazilian youtuber)
Matpat about to go 200% on these last videos
This is officially the worst year. First, matpat is gone, second, meatcanyon is gone, 3rd, xl bullys are being murdered in the uk (where im from) and the tiktok chef died at 65 (i think) .
E :(
This might be some of the most absolute soul crushing game theory vids but we all understand you can't always be there it's just sad that you won't be.
ive grown up watching your fnaf videos, its sad  seeing u go in march, ima miss u sm
i literally knew there would be one last garten of banban theory
Day 17 of asking matpat to do a theory on astroneer or grounded
Matpat you'll always be remembered as one of the best YouTubers of all times, you'll never be replaced ❤️🥹
I can’t believe the old intro is back
I LOVE BANBAN
So long matpat we will miss you
Thank you for being and ruining our childhoods.
You are a great person were gone to miss you

Nice to see you still rocking, matpat
I wouent give garden of bannan that munch credit
We are gonna miss MatPat harder than Banban misses that 2 hour refund mark.

5:08 @JoeCaine shows up😅
Im so glad he brought the intro back for his last few theories
Words can’t describe how happy hearing the og theme made me.  Let’s make these last few theories the best!

9 more theories to the final salute, everyone will miss you Matpat
8 videos left
YES!!!! The intro  We NEED to keep that going forward with Tom
i cant take this AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY HEART MAN
I swear these uttp bots are annoying af.
watching every childhood youtuber retire one by one..
pretty sure its weekend. so my nightmare is 2 days away
Do brawl stars!!!
Goodbye
Why did matpat have to quit that ruined my childhood
Game theory has always been one of the goats to YouTube everything is understandable in the situation there are not enough words your videos has always been fun
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA DO ANOTHER BANBAN THEORY BEFORE HE LEFT
There’s a game called Greg’s deadly draft and in it stinger Flynn is there bc they collabed with the euphoric brothers and stinger says he’s been traveling through universes and that’s how he found Greg and Charles
7:50 actually, that’s Nabnalina (notice the bow) under sir dadadoo control, meaning Nabnab is still out and about and probably still mutated.
You will be missed mat pat
classic intro making me cry😭 we’ll miss you mat!!!
So happy to see the Classic intro again. Really sad to see Mat go but the final 9 is gonna be fun (in a way) to watch.
I missed that intro
The start of the end. Let's do this.
We all are gonna miss you and we maby don't know you personally the fact still remains: you have had a massive impact of must of our childhoods
idk who would spend their life spamming " I MAKE BETTER CONTENT " or "SMOKING THAT PACK 🚬😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆" because that sounds like a terrible way to start out 💀
The nabnab you see after getting cornered in the elevator looks more like nabnaleena so idk if nabnab did get got after becoming a giant.
😭😭😭🤧🤧
Mat pat is the best youtuber
I’ll miss you mat pat
9 theory remain🙁
o7
I love how even Matpat was disappointed they were doing a Garten of BanBan theory for one of his final 10
🫡🫡🫡
Please do a poppy playtime 3 theory before u go cuz it will release January (i hop)
Why are you quitting why matpat whyyyyyyyyy???????
We miss you
I am not ready for this countdown in the beginning. And that classic intro was right in the feels. Ughh!

Even if the channel isn’t shutting down or something, I’m gonna miss MatPat’s voice of the videos ☹️ I’m not prepared for this I’m gonna miss you so much 💔
A moment of silence
We might as well give the new guy a chance, it’s going to be sad without matpat but we can’t just sit around sad that our favourite creator is gone we unfortunately have to move on
Bro the classic intro hurts knowing this might be the last couple times we hear it😭

We’ll miss you mate.  BUT GARDEN OF BAN BAN WE WILL NOT.
The thumbnail text should have been changed to abanbandon all hope! Lost potential
it would be so cool if the intro got older and older as we get closer to matts last video. i just wanna see the NES checkered floor intro again😂
can you make one last zelda timeline video? it would be the greteast gift to all of us!
I hope we see you in some video.maybe a collab or when Steve is sick we will miss you.we appreciate all you're work
Beanz
Thank you matpat chain                             👇
Glad to see he's doing a final round of theories before he leaves, would've been too sudden to accept a new theorist without some kind of warm up, so I like that personally for that
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😖😖😖😖😖😨😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭is all I can say
Matpat is my chidhood and i'll miss him forever
The old intro with the style theorist part added, the best part
I well try to hold my cires I am going to miss you matpet😢
i still dont know what a garten is
We gonna miss you matpat
as a beginning game developer i use banban as a guide of what not to do.
Only 9 more theories, 9 more theories until we grow up
0:28 Who else got overly excited that they added stil theory. (Dont mind the spelling)
"Beware the bus. His name is Gus. He's on the mainland though so don't worry too much. When you go back to the mainland, don't ride the bus. Gus bus bus the gus, He's bad and fast. Charles Fears Gus" -note in Choo Choo Charles. Connected lore?
I was head banging to the classic intro
9 more theories left..
Captain, my captain
He should bring back every iteration of the intro one for each theory or as many as he can
Yehhhhhhhh the opening
Out of all the theories 😭
We love you matpat❤ ITS JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY
NOSTALGIA
Love the classic intro. It's going to be a nice reminder for the years you've been doing this thanks matpat going to miss ya!❤❤❤
NO WORDS ARE NEEDED
Man gonna miss you
Bye Bye matpat ..
Ahh a classic
WHY IS EVERY REPLY A BOT
MAKE A THEORY ON ONE PIECE!!!!!!!!
CLASSIC INTRO!!!!
Joe Caine cutout in a theory video, it’s just so sweet. 🥹
There is just something truly special seeing MatPat bring back the old intro. Definitely will fully start bringing back all the theory memories into one big reunion.
I'm really gonna miss these🥹
His last theory should be the longest talk about thing on his channel Five Nights At Freddy's
matpat your the goat sad to see you go
That intro to me is the best
i hate "garten of banban" and everything it stands for but i will watch the video anyways since matpat is going into the moon soon
on the other hand matpat is finaly escaping fnaf
Another day, another victory for the OGs
These theories don’t hit the same when you know it’s a countdown till matpat leaves
We just gotta remember that he will still be helping out. He will never truly be gone.
Ill miss you Matpat, you are the living embodiment of my childhood, I will miss you.
Bai
0:21 the OG intro 😢
we have 8 more days.. We’re going to miss you a lot matpat. ima miss you a lot. you always comforted me. Theorist Forever<3. You introduced me to the fnaf fandom and many other fandoms due to your amazing theories. thank you for that. We’ll miss you. 🫂 love the classic intro btw. ◡̈
i cannot wait for the next game of therorys!
WE LOVE YOu
The whole 9 theories thing reminds me of that 9 side missions thing from the Riddler side quest in Arkham Knight. In fact Matt Pat has always given me Riddler vibes
The last 9:))I will enjoy these
i demand that the few times matpat does feature on game theory after his resignation that he uses the old opening, we'll likely never see it again once the next guy takes over
We love you matpat😢
o7 🫡
we still going to miss you man
my head hurts i come to watch matpat and its stops .......my brain tells me to watch you     i will miss you
The explosion at the end😂
May you take a brea We will miss you.
I’m gonna miss you sm I hope for an amazing life and healthy family♥️♥️♥️
Hello matpat❤❤
You were a part of my childhood we  will all miss you matpat
Please let the last theory be the best
THE OLD INTRO'S BACK!!!!
Matpat is the GOAT. THE GOAT!!! ‼️‼️‼️💯💯
The last theory of this channel should be a FNAF theory THE THING THAT MADE THIS MAN MORE POPULAR it would've been better if the FNAF recap was the last video but it is what it is
MatPat is the only YouTuber leaving that I've actually felt like I'm losing something major in my life
W CLASIC INTRO THO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dawn Of A New Day 9 Theories Remain.
we’re all gonna miss u
Not me freaking out for the intro... Okay, I shed tears
Salute for mattpat gone but not forgotten 😢
This channel will never be the same without matpat
Everyone in the comments...lets give matpat a clap and a half as well as a salut as he steps back from the channels for new hosts!  👏 🫡
For more than a decade MatPat has Theorised with us, Taught us science, social behaviour, economics, psychology, botany, maths, as well as many more subjects. He has been a wonder to watch. And to be a part of this community is something I will always have in my heart.  I am very happy for him and his family. The hard work and dedication both he and Steph have done will not go unappreciated.
YOU LIVE
The intro!!!! i missed the intro....
THE CLASSIC INTO
Yeah sure guys him leaving is sad and all but i think we should accept that and like atleast make our comments based on the video and not "wer gonna miss yoyou !!!"
The original intro i missed it
I'll wake up tomorrow and this will just be a nightmare
matrick pathew give me money
We all going to miss you! Matpat!!
Wow that was unexpected but I wanted you to do it anyway
lies
OMG THE OLD INTRO 😭😭😭💔💔
I honing to miss this
I know it's a weird suggestion but on film theory could you cover hazbin hotel again as a lot more lore has been put out
Out of the nine last theories. BAN BAN???? Okay.
I'm going to miss you.
We're in the Endgame now
Mat, from the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for everything, we all hope you enjoy your retirement!!
DO RALDIS CRACKHOUSE
Matpat we are going to miss you
I'm gonna miss you talking your voice make me feel happy 😢 pause...
DONTT GOO PLEASE we all love you matpat!!!
I started watching Mat in college. He's only a couple years older than I am. I say this because, while he might not have been a childhood icon for me, in a way,  his positivity and intelligence has been a welcome addition to my life. Seeing him go is like watching a friend move away. Gonna miss you buddy, and that's no theory.
Ohh... the classic intro... we need more of it, too bad it will probably go away forever soon enough
Let’s go the classic intro
Im here just for MatPat. I dont care about this game, but I care about my favorite theorist. This video was incredible
o7
THE CLASSSSSICC INTROOOOOO
Man I miss the old intro
MAT PAT PLEASE MAKE ONE LAST DELTARUNE THEORY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THEORIES I WATCHED FOR ONE OF THE NINE THEORIES PLEASE
Going to miss you mattpat
God...This isn't happening...   Its happening, Countdown of the last videos started
Are you still quiting...?
We will miss ya, Mat.
We finally got the OG INTRO BACK!
Man bots ruin everything literally all the comments replies are flooded with bots
classic intro best intro
Leave🙏
You’re going to be missed, MatPat!
The old intro hit so hard
Have a great life mattpatt we’ll all miss you
I’ve watched this channel for 5 years of my life when I was 12 and I think I can say what we’re all thinking goodbye matpat
I hope you have a wonderful life Matpat, Goodluck. I will always remember you in my heart, goodbye 😢
🫡
At least we got the classic gametheory intro.  Edit:  2:13, I wouldn’t call the Euphoric Brothers “smart”, given their games get longer and longer for each installment.  Not to mention they handle criticism poorly on twitter.    Aside from that, GOB has a neat idea, it was just poorly executed.  That’s my opinion, I won’t judge anyone if you disagree with me.  Hopefully we’ll get one more FNAF theory video before Matpat retires as the host.
Garden of f ing banban
Mr mattpat I just want to say that I know that I'm just one of millions of your fans but you inspire me to make YouTube videos myself you'll always be one one ideals
Old intro is rocking
Y'all, do you seriously want to cheris the last days we have with Matpat by all saying "We'll miss you! 😢" Of course we're gonna miss him, but it's already hard for him as it is for us, let's not make it even harder
I haven't watched Game Theory in forever, but screen it, this is for MatPat
I can't believe he used one of the final theories on Garten of BanBan
We’re all going to miss you MatPat
missin him so much ps he didnt beat it yet
🫡
Wait the godzilla one was not apart of this
matpat will never become a forgotten child in this world
And we are now entering MatPats final season of Theorys. MatPat will be missed
WOOOOO I MISSED THE OLD INTRO 😭🔥🔥
You were and are my childhood, I will miss you
Jeez dude, you didn't have to hit us with the Majora's Mask countdown.
There’s something fascinating about how Garten of Banban decided to compensate for a lack of polish or skill with sheer insanity.
Farewell mat pat
Matpat if you leave you will ruin my childhood
That's... that's not the classic intro
I always had that theory that the character we played as was William Afton since you said in this theory that the kindergarten had no end in sight, kinda like how William Afton was subjected to torture in Ultimate Custom Night.
MatPat, you will be missed. Thank you for the theories. I'm wishing you all the best! Enjoy your retirement!
this would even explain why were hit by the bus in the latest dream sequence that hit was telling us 'hey, the green goblin kid was friends with the others, but now the authorities took him away as a punch to the face'
Yay
The goat
Gonna miss you man
0:25 What!?!?  I did not see that coming. That makes me happy. And also i'm really going to miss you my boy
Last 9 theories akd your going out with Ban ban and not some absurd fnaf theory? Weird choice but man will the internet miss you
0:58 I guess I'm blessed then. I've never seen this in my life 😅
love you
Mapat: I’m gonna do a couple more theories then I quit  Also Matpat: makes a ban ban theory 🫤
thank you, matpat
Finally we have the old intro
I’m not crying…
I will never forget you matpat! :c
We’re gonna miss you matpat, you will live on in our hearts!
This is the best first video of the final 10 that i could've asked for, i love this insane game omg i love you matpat
We’ll miss you, but I hope you have a great retirement with your family!
can they jus use AI to make it sound like MatPat😭😭  the way Matthew talks and the way his voice sounds is actually so comforting and idk why😢💀
I know you’re leaving and you deserve to have your freedom back but please come back for Poppy please I was hoping I would get to see that day where you had to struggle trying to play it. I know that sounds the same but please even if you won’t be too much, a part of it at least make a cameo.
Not only is mat giving us some final few send off videos, but he brought back the original intro. Thank you mat. :)
Man the classic intro really got me emotional. Gonna miss you Matt
I'll miss you it was a pleasure watching your videos
MatPat is just passing off the torch  I wouldn't have anyone else ruin my childhood than him  So proud of this dude for making a great choice for his family and his health!
The 9 theories left got me in tears
AYOO the classic intro!
Bye Bye matpat
the og intro sent shivers down my spine
🙏  Matt pat please don't. 😮🙏
I’m gonna miss matpat
you got a love how nobody is new to MatPat, and almost almost everybody has heard of him so everybody got what that intro ment cause there is nobody that is like “wait what? Who is this guy? And why is he leaving?”
Sad to see you go MatPat, wish you the best of luck and I'll continue to support the great channels you've help make!! 🎉🎉
Bye Matpat 😢
Making your childhood since 2011
The original game theory intro just hits different
THE THEORY, THE THEORY IS REAL!!!!
Wow garden of banban!😂
Mats last 9
Love your video, Matt, and we are going to miss you
Introduce chopper crying We are going to miss you mat
It’s great seeing the old intro again
My nightmare is matpat leaving :(
This intro brought tears to me
Matpat your my fav yourtuber
😞
I know theres 9 more but why am i shedding tears already I hate it
8 theories left
We’ll miss u matpat
Little thing I’ve seen to collect with the notes is that the human who’s dna is in the monster is still alive and separate from the creatures themselves, Banban was introduced to his human counterpart part but instead of seeing himself as ‘Banban’ he started seeing himself as Uthman, which would be why he tells us his name is Uthman in that one scene in chapter 4 and why  BitterGiggle mentions he gets mad when he calls him Banban, I’m guessing the same thing happened with Banbaleena because Toadster says her name is Ms. Mason instead of Banbaleena, and in one note about the Queen it says that her human counterpart wasn’t announced to her because of the incident with Banban, not a 100% sure but it’s something I’ve collected from the clues in game
NOO MATPAT
…we will miss you MatPat you were and still are amazing, I can’t wait to see what Tom has planned for future times and until then you are amazing you were my childhood and I still can’t imagine that this day would come and to me and I think so almost everyone you didn’t ruin childhood’s you created childhood’s… idk what to say besides Thank You✨💕 you were amazing I’ve watched you since I was a little kid and I still watched and I can’t wait for future times!✨ :) you will be missed by all
Glad we finally got the classic intro again
Adios amigo farewell don’t let the door hit you in the
)8
We're going to miss you MatPat 😊😊😊 Long live Game Theory 😭😭😭
The old intro actually made me tear up a bit, we’re gonna miss you MatPat, hope you live well
Hoping you will pop in every now and then.
I'm gonna miss you so much Matt 😢
At least we can get Banban out of the way >.>

R.I.P Matpat, you will be missed forever, thanks for giving us theories, and our childhoods ❤❤❤
MATPATTT what is this game? I've never played it...., anyways imma miss you

I had to rewind that explanation of the games because just listening to it caused me to pause and wonder if Mattpat had a stoke or something
I already miss u mat pat😢😢😭

The classical intro felt soooo nostalgic
screams in despair
i i i love you matpat!!!!!!!!!!!!!! loiek if support matpat
I MISSED THAT INTRO!!!!!
"HELLO INTERNET WELCOME TO GAME THEORY"
😢
The person who is commenting about how their account is better needs to stop tbh, its rude to say stuff like that
It’s going to be the end of the best era
Im going to miss you game theory
Knowing one of his last few theories is Garten of banban is hilarious
Only 10 theories left and you waste it on an indie game with poor, boring, repetitive, gameplay, low quality voice overs, poor reviews, overly simple character design, and surface level lore.
Well miss you matt..
Gonna miss you Matpat. You were a big part of my childhood and introduced me to so many different games over the years. Cheers and enjoy your life ❤❤
Seya later Matpat we’ll all miss you
THE INTRO'S BACK SHEEEASH
Thanks Matpat. You just made my day. ❤
Legit don’t think I’m gonna be able to live a normal life without matpat :(
Bye Matpat We All Have You In Our Heart
We miss you MatPatt.
Mat, when you gonna make your “My Way” cover?
Earliest I've ever been to a video, clicked the second I saw it❤❤
😭 so sad to see you go matpat….keep on theorizing
matpat will be remembered as the goat  il miss matpat ;(

The fact that matpats last vid is a garten of banban vid so i cant watch it hurts my soul
We love you matPat
I’ll miss you childhood hero
If u read the letter it says he throws them around like toys? That's what Jumbo Josh does...
Glad to see you posted! Hope your doing well, matpat!mwe’ll miss you, can’t wait to see the last few theories with you!
Will miss you matpat
Firstly I'm gonna miss you Matpat.😢 Secondly, the sheriff guy called Miss Marson in chapter 6. Perhaps that something important
the classic intro really made me tear up
29 minutes out and 119k views, woah
We are going to miss you MatPat, we support you in all of your future endeavors
Please before you go do a theory about deltarune IM DESPERATE.
Has anyone else noticed that when ads pop up and you hit the skip button they give you another ad? 👀🤦 Fix it YouTube 🙄
Classic intro is back for the last 9 theories!
Blud wasting one of the last theorys on a cashgrab
Were all going to miss him
Well, at least MatPat will still work on the channels. But hey!, lets enjoy these episodes while it lasts!
jest be happy for now ... :D
Why'd you ever move on form the classic intro?
0:12 Oh...this hit me right in the heart. We'll all miss you mat.
Dam I really am gonna miss you matpat so will everyone else fair well old friend have a great day
I think the final theory is gonna be the fnaf 4 box IT HAS TO BE THE BOX.
Wait, banban said in chapter 3 "I have a friend who does know" And that "friend" Is stinger flynn, so maybe stinger just started with just some simple insults and then they had a big rivalry at the end
BEST MOMENT 0:19
👍
Come on guys, turn those frowns up side downs, he’s not gonna be always be gone or gone forever, he may pop up in short cameos and he’ll still be apart of all the theories
Every horror game rushing to put out the next chapter as fast as possible so Matpat can do a theory on it.
God it will take me a while to not be sad about you retiring, you made my childhood, and other theory channels wont be like you You played a really special part in my life. Ill miss you when you do retire
we will miss u maypat soo much ❤❤
Bringing back the classic intro, MatPat knows we want the best, and we getting the best 🤗
The old intro is back baby!! ❤
I can’t watch ur content after ur gone its gonna be devastating for me
THE CLASSIC INTRO!!
I have a theory that that bus we saw was a sneak peek to Gus the Bus from Cho Cho Charles bc we already saw Charles in the forth game
We will all miss you, Matpat. But all of us respect your decision. Thank you for everything!
The classic intro!!! Thank you so much Matpat ❤❤❤❤
9 THEORIES REMAIN! LET’S GOOOOO!
When poppy playtime 3 comes out, you should just make a comeback for it.

Classic Intro: best Intro. Give me chills
I was just looking for the intro after he announced his retirement to see if there’s style theory yet, thank you Matpat. Thank you for all you’ve done over the years. Even though I considered myself to be a new fan (I joined around 2018) I will still be missing you. We all will.
Seeing the classic intro with MatPat again felt so nostalgic but it shouldn't *yet*. He's here to tell his theory but I already miss him somehow.

👍
Can you please do one more Sonic theory too?
NOOOOOOOOOOO MATPAT
NOOOOOOOOOOO MATPAT
If you do a tails doll theory I have an idea technically he's more chaotic than anything so what if he would just a doll fused with chaos energy
I must've missed the previous video, because I genuinely never heard of Garten of Banban
The classic intro gave me hype, especially with the style theory colors
I’m gonna miss you saying “That’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY!”
you will be missed matpat
We all gonna miss him
:( matpat was my childhood i will miss him
my man i think i speak for all of us when i say   Thank you, for the times we’ve had watching your videos, laughing at your “jokes”, and thinking,  “man how did I miss that??” Hope you make a lot of guest appearances (:
I'm happy that the channel will still live on, with or without mat...although it will never be the same.
THE CLASSIC INTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
9
Please dont leave😭😭😭
Goodbye MatPat                       “But it’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY!”
Thanks for ruining my childhood sense 2011 with your amazing theories you will be missed
I'm crying out my eyeballs everytime I hear ur voice
hearing that old intro again gave me shivers dude
Oh man, how much I've missed Science Blaster. That gave me instantaneous serotonin.
it so sad because ur frist vid was when i was born
Putting the game theory intro as my ringtone just for matpat
I has the dumbest smile on My face through out the entire intro
abandon hope THERE IS ONLY DESPAIR!!! *UPHUHUHUHUHU*
Im gonna miss Matpat. tysm for being in my childhood
Dude, I can't man. I'll miss MatPat
Don't be sad that it's ending, be glad that it happened
Only true matpat fans would like this comment 👇
"ruining your childhood since 2011" hes been here since I was born
matt if you leave soon we gotta decide who's gonna take the Chanel
Honestly it's so smart for MatPat to be leaving the channel now. It's bringing The Game Theorists so much attention and honestly? I don't mind one bit. This channel deserves it in its entirety and its so much better than letting your viewers forget about you and fading into obscurity. Well played, GrandPat.
We're all gonna miss you matpat
Without you my whole childhood will be gone
We love you matpat
That intro music is iconic
Matpat, you need a heros send off.
lets goooo old intro
I love you matpat you got me into lore ❤
nabnab didnt get turned into a zombie, that was nabnaleena i think, since she had a bow.
I think it would be interesting and cool for MatPat to have his last theories on Fran Bow.
We're all gonna miss you❤
1st of 9 theories…
Still sad
I can't believe we only have 8 more theories with matpat after this T^T
The  old intro......
We’re gonna miss you
Matpat will forever be our favorite teacher during childhood
I will miss ya, matpat
Honestly you're where I got most of my creepypastas for my own theories Matt Pat
Btw we never got too see nab nab in the end because the one in the corner is nabnaleena because of the bow on her head
Mai he rest
Too early
See ya Matpat (I Suppose)
I wish u dident have to leave but what can we say thanks for the 13 years of content
The internet is not going to be the same without matpat me and everyone on the Internet will miss our favorite theorist😢❤
Im gunna miss matpat sm, ill be watching (or listening) his vids when i go for my eye surgeries:D
when matpat leaves so will i
We are going to miss you MatPat…

Hey clasic intro

Ok mat wasn't joking when he said nabnab became a dark souls boss, that's literally gaping dragon from DS1
Thank you MatPat, for everything, including my childhood and all the facts about games
o7 in the chats boys
Wasting one of your last theories on garten of banban is so dumb but I love you matpat
I’m gonna miss you 😭😭😭😭🎅🙃😭☹️
It’s not the same watching… anymore at least
Is mr beast real
Dude why are you leaving we are going to miss you
I’ll never be able to watch these videos because matpats voice is too iconic and the other guy just sounds weird
"Ruining your childhood since 2011"💀 ily mat <3 I'll miss you hosting the channel but I'm happy you found what you really wanted to do
thank you for everything MatPat..
I am going to enjoy every millisecond of this
9 remain
Imagine seeing this channel back in the days of Mario theories, stopped for the next couple of years and returned to this video 😂 what’s going on
Gonna miss u mat grew up with you from ur first fnaf theory to now thank you for the memories
Man, I love this channel. Thank you Matpat
bye matpat
Make an episode marathon
I can't bare him leaving.
Kind of off topic but it’s kind of insane to mean how much money you would be spending if you’ve bought every garten of banban game so far, you’re looking at like 30-40 dollars and they aren’t stopping anytime soon😂
Ill miss u matpat
🪦
15:08 i guess hes driving across the border
Long live the matking

Where did Austin go?
“Ruining your childhood since 2011” no it’s “creating your childhood since 2011” we’ll miss you ❤️
I bet the last theory he does will be about the same thing he made his first theory about or be about fnaf
Is not gonna be the same witout u mat
MatPat doing of BanBan once again 😢. Bittersweet.

MatPat you are gonna sincerely be missed by me and millions of others 😭❤
Wait, when you say 9 theories, do you mean 9 weeks(which means there will be 9 for each channel). Or does it just mean 9 in total across all channels?  Either way, Im crying.

❤️❤️❤️YouTube Legend
HIS THEORIES BETTER WND WITH FNAF
Even though I haven’t watched you much or been with you since the beginning it still breaks my heart that you are leaving. However we all know there’s nothing we can do to stop it and all we can do is to respect your wishes and decisions. We will miss you being the main person on the show and making us smile. Have an amazing break Matpat, we thank you.
Classic intro hit like a nostalgia semi truck
I‘ll miss you.
— 9 THEORIES REMAIN —  Really felt like twisting the knife, huh Matthew?
It took you this long to figure that out?
Bringing back the original intro almost made me cry again

We are going to miss you so Much I will still watch your other videos ❤😭
I hope You Return someday, Matpat.
Yay 9 theories left….
Said to ruin our childhoods, yet now we realise he made them......
How can the player be the child if the child is in the backround of the dreams? I might be wrong but I'm curious how that is.

o7
I smiled when I saw the original intro.  My god am I gonna miss Mat
I always did miss that classic intro. No school like the old school!
BRING BACK THE CLASSIC GAME THEORY INTRO
What are the chances that you as the PC are in pursuit of "the perfect child" and thats why Stinger is telling us that our hunt four "our child" is fruitless and hurting everyone around the garten?
"Don't Cry Because Its Over" "Smile Because It Happened "  Matthew Patrick Will Me Missed </3
Mat pat... bye
You know in the dreams we actually might be playing as navnalena sins in chapter 3 nabnab shows and us kindness in the dream by giving us the broccoli he’s showing affection

I still don't get it. Why is he leaving
We’re all going to miss you😊
ITS THE FINAL THEORIES  *Whistle*
Bye,matpat
WHOO CLASSIC INTRO!
I will miss your voice so much
I hope and pray that 1 he enjoys retirement as much as possible, and 2 that his final theory uses one of the older game theory intros, like the og one or something
Mat we’re gonna miss you but if your last video isn’t a final FANF video I will be disappointed
OH YEA  OG INTRO FOR LIFEEEEEEEEE

We love you matpat! Ive been rewatching old videos and crying at the outro 😭 you were and still are such a big part of my childhood, and when it came to the end you didnt make me feel like just another subscriber. I'm not a number, you're right, im a dedicated veiwer, a fan, and someone that loves what youve put out there
God I love that intro
I’m not emotionally ready for this
We’re going to miss you matpat 😢
The old intro is pure nostalgia
The fact that you brought back the old intros... It fills me with Determination. Which brings me to Sans is Ness. Is this oart of your last theory?
POV me when I heard mato at is retiring 😭

Even if we don’t know you personally, you’ve been giving us theories nearly every week now for over a decade, and that means a lot. Thank you for everything, MatPat.

THE CLASSIC INTRO I MISSED IT SO MUCH

😢😢😢  matpat
I’m going to miss you so much. Honestly I feel weird about crying over a video but it’s so sad to see a childhood friend leave. I’ll remember you until the day I die
Nooo, this is not on the final 9.... Mano, como assim irmão?
Oh man, I Will miss you
I can't believe that the first of his latest theories is from Garten of BamBam... I expected something more impactful, honestly

I'm gonna to miss you so much matpat Thenk you for everything❤
watching every new video multiple times
Thank you MatPat as a fellow grown up theater kid you'll always be an inspiration. Thank you for the years of entertainment. I still have a back log of theories to catch up on... When I run out of the ones that are hosted by you in this amazing era that you've had I'll move on to the new because I trust and respect your decision and the channels themselves. I can't even count the vocabulary and different sorts of ways to measure things I learned here. Absolutely thank you.
Goodbye  🫡
Super epic intro
We’re gonna miss you MatPat
Nine theories remain!? I must cherish these
Matpat when you leave be safe and we shall all miss you
W INTRO
Keep the classic intro! I miss an actual OP for youtube
I have been waiting to see style theory blue on that intro for ages
Great video like always i am gonna miss you watching theorys will never be the same without you telling them
also whats the sound effect called at the start of the video? where it says 9 theories remain?
So it’s safe to say we’re all crying😢
The Internet Is gonna be so drained down when you leave the internet Matpat, We will miss you…
Matpat we will all miss you please dont leave us 😭😭😭
Garten Of Money Like This Sucks.
im miss you my best guy ever
I'm going to cry
The awkward silence at the end 😂
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO YESSSSS
We never get any comfermatiin that nabnab is under the mind control. Up there on the ceiling is nabnalina notice the bow in the hair. So nab nabs still out there
the countdown has started...
The classic still hits hard
Can't  wait to see  you around the studio every  know  and then
9 remaining.
Science blaster 4 life
:(
T.I.P MatPat, theorise in peace
Imagine if they would make ai matpat voice 😂
We got garden of banban chapter 6 before gta6
I wonder who is going to fill the void MatPat leaves. I don't mean Tom or any new hosts, I mean what MatPat *actually* brings to the internet. Whoever manages to capture mindshare in a meaningful way will influence the kinds of games that come out and what makes money for the next decade or more.
YYYEEAAAAHHH CLASSIC INTROOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Seeing the classic intro bring years to my eye😢
Mat Pat u were my childhood….I love u so much😭😭😭😭😭
😔

the classic intro actually hit me in the heart, THE MEMORYS MAN
that intro sent chills down my spine
Waited so long for that intro
We are all going to miss you MatPat. But I can’t wait to see all these upcoming theories. I am sure that I will continue to enjoy them even though your not in the hosting position.
We're all going to miss you MatPat and all your insane theories
This is a dark timeline we’re in
one of the last ones wasted on garten of banban????? why????
This channel was made in 2011, when I was born, for my 10th birthday fnaf security breach released and I stayed all night watching your livestream, you really are my childhood Matt, I’ll miss you
I like how it’s not even March yet and everyone is acting like Mat is leaving Tomorrow. Shows just how much of an impact this legend has on the internet.
Were gonna miss you matpat
I love your videos you’ve been with me since I was young idk like when I was like 4 or 5 I love your videos I’ve watched many of your theories I’m in love with your theories it’s sad to see you go
Everyday we get closer to the inevitable 😢
I feel like matpat is the only one to actually complement the euphoric brothers. we will miss you.
somehow this guy makes garten of banban interesting, we're gonna miss you
We will miss ya Matpat
I'm going to miss you matpat
on the first final ten, mat pat gave to me! a ban ban the o ree!
I feel like the channel won't feel the same after matpat leaves...😭😭

Knowing that he's quiting and now watching this video doesn't feel the same anymore
god i missed the old intro
0:21 I’m so happy you brought back the old intro
Im going to miss yoy matpat
We’ll miss you matpat.         (one of the last theories better be our promised piggy theory back when you theorised doors, like how can you get infected or is TIO coming back)
You will be missed and remembered
Of all the games you could have  chosen to make a theory on  You chose this diarrhea of a game
I can't believe it soon your gonna leave goodbye Matpat and thank you
No one will forget matpat
Seeing the old intro is so great
The classic entro 😭❤️

The beginning was so nostalgic
I still feel kind of torn about him handing the chanales over.
I’m really gonna miss you MatPat. You were my childhood and you will always have a place in my heart
I'm going to miss you so much, MatPat. 😢
The classic has always been my favorite with no others competing in my opinion
I’m gonna miss those big biceps, Matt!    God Bless. 🥺😖😭

I'm gonna miss you so badly matpat, it's been 5 years i've been watching you, thank you for a wonderful childhood😭😭😭  It's just a theory, a GAME THEORY!, GoodBye MatPat.
Hey can. You do granny and slenderina you've never done that and it's better than banban
Why why?!
For his final video the intro should be a mashup of all his ontros
I always loved the classic intro, why did you guys change ittt?
"sometimes, you just never know the value of a moment, until it becomes a memory"
Going out with style, classic Matt.   We're here with ya buddy.
Love the classic intro and Matpat
:(
9.  Don't quite remember exactly when I got into game theory, but it was when it was multi-show. Glad I did.
im gonna miss matpat and his amazing theories they were amazing!
Goodbye, MatPat. Every last one of us will miss you deeply. I truly hope you make a cameo in future videos❤
GodSpeed MatPat, GodSpeed.
I wonder how much of his sanity he has lost because of making these theory videos
matpat doing a peakpeak theory before quitting is awesome
Another day,another theory ^^ Thanks to every person that worked on this theory And I hope I don't miss the livestream on march
You will never be forgotten, Matpat
You made my childhood
the last game theory but mat pat needs a break even if it has to be foever :(
I'm gonna miss Matpat he can make an theory everything
I'll miss this, specially the intro
We're going to miss you so much MatPat.
Man I’ll never stop watching your theories their always so cool to see
YES!!!!!!! INTRO SONG!!!!!!!!   Although I do think when this “Tom” takes over he should make the intro the chorus to the “A little theorizing” song.
I’m not going to get over the thought that one of your last theories is about Garten of Banban. Regardless, it’s still a pretty interesting theory. I’m going to miss these.
We will miss u MatPat 9 theories left to go 😢
I can feel the nostalgia filling me up listening to this
Ill miss matt patt😭
MATPAT ERA IS ALWAYS THE GOLDEN ERA ESPECIALLY WITH THE CLASSIC INTRO
Wish he did just 1 more TF2 theory video.

So question will all YOUR old vids still be on the channel or will they be deleted? I hope not, you arey childhood and i will miss you so much.
Hello Internet, welcome to Game Theory ! The show where everyone and his grandmother is a fan of Matpat !
MatPat you are the best theorist. You will be truly missed by us all. 😢

YOU ADDED THE BLUE TO THE INTRO!!! also imma miss u matpat
SO HAPPY to hear the intro again
so long we will miss you mat.
the old intro, i couldn't not rock out to it. My brother looked at me weird
Goodbye Matpat, thank you for carrying everyone’s childhoods.
I can’t believe Garten of BanBan has gotten the popularity and privilege to be one of Matpats last theories, we truly live in the darkest timeline fr
Dont leave us MatPat
It’s finally back it’s back the old into the og intro
when he quits ima kms
I gonna Miss him :(
We will all miss you❤ mat pat
Last theory is gonna be Fnaf
Wait.. do we get 10 theories on all channel individually??

We will never forget about you mat
These theories are coming out way to fast im not ready for matpat to go :(((   We’ll miss you !!!!
i won't be able to watch these last nine theories without the thought of matt leaving the channel racing through my head i'm gonna miss him.
seeing the old intro made me cry bro ily matpat
.
This is the nostalgic man
I wish the last one is fnaf lol
Oh so that’s why zolphius are in stinger Flynn’s sequence dreams
It is all coming to and end, starting now. We will miss you.
So the Game/film/food theory intros will be used again  Does that mean we’ll get style theory intro?
the story for the game is getting weird
<:*(]
I hope you stay so much
Why did he waste one of his last theories on banban
THE CLASSIC INTRO OMG
He’s really going to be gone, but hearing that old intro brings tears to my eyes
MatPat you'll always be OUR Favorite theorist for Game/Film/Food/Style Theory! Hope you have a Great Life from Youtube... we'll miss you on the Channel! 12 years of the BEST Theorist!
ha ha i hope matpat is gonna have some fun on the last few theories he puts out, have fun buddy
OG INTRO
Freaking ban ban lol I’ll enjoy the vid no matter what tho :)
Can't believe you're going out with a garden Banban Theory😭✋️  Love to you Matthew made our childhood❤️
the fact that matpat chose garten of banban as one of his final videos is unbearable. on one hand i wanna watch him as a thank you, but also its garten of banban
Tomtheory when
Can we have some cameos?
i can't watch tom due to how he speaks
Man seeing the intro and the PNG for one of the last times feels so strange
Love you matpat
I'm going to cry YouTube will not be the same
I still can’t believe this isn’t some kind of nightmare and that he’s actually leaving
Can’t he just do 1 theory every 2 years or something
The nostalgia that came with OG logo
9th to last ever theory… We will miss you so much Matpat. We are happy for you to be with family more though.
I'm gonna miss this voice.   Also, I should say Nabnab didn't lose, Nabnaleena was the one that got brainwashed, you can see that because of the bow, it doesn't matter at all especially not for the theory, but I wanted to point it out
Wont you do lethal company
8, 7 more I don`t want to miss a single minute.... even if it is BanBan
CLASSIC INTROOOOOOOOO
goodbye, matpat, i will miss you...
16 minutes ago i was crying...cause i saw this and remembered you..
It makes no sense
We’re gonna miss you so much MatPat, thank you for all the laughs 🫶🏻
I imagone the final theory is going to be fnaf lol
Everybody’s gonna miss you MatPat😞
I am going to miss this voice
That classic intro, man
Oh thank god, I couldn’t watch a Garten of ban ban theory without you matpat
WERE GOING TO MISS YOU MAT PAT 😭
I hate when YouTubers say their gonna quit youtube but upload another video the next day
matpat 😢
Did u release the theory before you put up all of your playthrough?
Im not going to be the only one tho is going to miss matpat
This feels like spending the final month with your dying friend.
I can’t believe you wasted a theory on this
I bet the last one will be a fnaf one
dang matpat thanks for caring for us we're gonna miss you
1 down. 8 more to go.
Can you theory about Gobstoppers on food theory
Please don't leave us😢
YES THE CLASSIC INTRO IS BACK!!!!!!

huggy wuggy seek scary blue zumbo sauce 🗣️
Goodbye MR.Mattpat  (1 theorits gang)
Not even a minute in and I'm ready to fight god from the intro
took ya long enough to use the classic intro
so many bots in the comments
We will miss you Matpat.... we will never forget you
We will miss you Matpat
9 more videos of awesomeness, classic intro, and Matpat's voice and presence.
Game Theory without MatPat is like Konami without Kojima. 😕
LETS GO HE USED THE CLASSIC
this feels like chatting with someone with terminal cancer ;n;
I wonder if there’s a comment somewhere here saying “Erm actually Nabnab isn’t apart of Sir Dadadoo’s army at the end, it’s actually Nabnaleena, you can tell because she’s wearing a bow, not a party hat”
The countdown begins 😢
NOT YET NOOO IT’S ALREADY HERE
LESSS GO
I will never forget you for matpat I love this channel goodbye
Thanks for bringing back the intro, it means so much to longtime theorists.(I've been watching gt since I was 7. Aka 2015, when the fnaf madness started. )
Why did MatP{at have to make GARTEN OF BANBAN one of his last theories :(
We will miss you MatPat, we love you❤
We’ll miss you Matpat ❤

Bro, I’m gonna miss MatPat so much big part of my childhood

The classic intro brought back nostalgia.
Just wanna say, in the ending sequence with all the mind controlled characters, nabnab isnt there. Thats nabnaleena
They have made many scary theory’s, but the one most scary to watch,will be his final theory. But that’s just a theory, I game theory.
The Intro…oh man…
Your the goat matpat, u will forever be a legend on the internet for decades to come. Enjoy your life u deserve it <3
I will miss you matpat you inspired me to start doing Fnaf theory’s and you tube thank you 😭
Went on whiplash went from crying sad tears because you were leaving the crying happy tears because old intro

WE love you
HE BROUGHT BACK THE INTRO???
Gotta love the classic intro
The intro is back!!!!
Gonna miss this channel. It's a shame y'all ran Austin off. He would have been perfect for the job. I loved his science rants, even if he did mess up once in a while. Dude was genuinely funny, and you could feel his passion in his earlier videos.
I WAS WORRIED THE INTRO WASNT GONNA BE HERE
We will all miss you deeply MatPat❤
yeeeessssssss we get the old intro lets gooooooo iv missed this thing sins it was gone we love the old intro
You always need the original intro.

Thank you mat pat for your content.
Miss you so much🥺😢🥺🥺
Ill suffer through this, for you Matpat.
Hope you play the classic intro for one of the last theories
Beans
Sad day
Thankyou Matpat,for being my childhood 💖
Hehehehe, we'll miss your mat
9 theories left 😢
It is joever
THE CLASSIC INTRO HAD ME CRYING 😭
THE INTRO I MISSED SO MUCH
It’s because she had a bow not a hat is was nabnaleena that was caught not nabnab we don’t know where he is now or maybe he was caught idk
I’m going to miss MatPat
You were such an inspirational man to me, Matpat...
Love you😭
😢😢😢😢
Wait is he actually going to stop making theory's 😢
out of all theorys why garten of ban ban
God it’s gonna be so hard to see you go.
Matttttt we’ll miss youuu you’re one of the structures of YouTube!!!!well my YouTube
About the intro: Man, I can't really choose which is better: in-theme openings or the absolute bangers of a classic that's been here for over a decade! I wish both are use more equally but I do appreciate the thoughts that were put into the in-theme openings!
And about Bendy The Cage
9 theories remain......
Old intro updated then it must be my birthday
Dear matpat, I know you may not see this comment or anyone else's but me, on the  Behalf of the game theorists fans and community.  Thank you, for best 13 years of our lives, you are the reason why you made our childhoods the greatest and raised us to fall in love games more, making up theories, always watching your videos everyday after school.  You made our childhood a golden era and you, you are the amazing person and my hero I love, and we love today, til this day.     Always loved your petscop theories. Always do.  Now with 9 theories remaining... we love you matpat... we,ll see you soon in the flipside. ❤  Loyal theorists for 13 years - Sirus
E
Yes the classic intro
We’re gonna miss you a lot MatPat. Thank you for everything you’ve done for us. We will remember you ❤
Ban ban isn’t aware he isn’t human anymore that’s what I find sad he gets angry when bittergiggle calls him ban ban instead of uthman so when he’s called ban ban like by the kids he gets mad
Yes classic intro!!!🎉🎉🎉❤❤
9 more theories to go..
I missed that intro
Lets hope its shorts wars 2
wait, the last video he will be in...?
Seeing the og intro while knowing that MatPat gonna be leaving soon feels sorta surreal. But all I, or anyone really can say is this: Thank you for shaping all of our childhood and even some of our adulthood as well. You will be missed, but never forgotten. 🥲
the classic intro brings back so much nostalgia, I'll miss it
The one from the Mind Control Spell from the ending wasn’t NabNab but instead Nabnaleena if you look at the bow it’s glowing. Because Gavanium Kaijus can’t go back to normal until the Gavanium is removed.   In chapter six, there’s a lil beak mini boss battle and she went back to her normal baby size when she was crushed by the wall when you go to get the Queen’s Septer
I was honestly also a bit disappointed that chapter 6 was… lackluster, to say the least 😅
Bro I'm crying
heat
We will miss you matpat
7
Mat pat we are going to miss you
Stay safe, mat, we’ll always love and miss you, hope to see what you do in the future
Goodbye matpat
if these are gonna be the last matpat theorys than they ar pobably gona be absolute bangers
I’m gonna miss you a whole ton man. I really don’t want to see you go, but I understand that you’re tired. We’ll miss you, MatPat!
i hope one of the 9 theories is omori based
As much as I am going to miss MatPat, I am also way too excited to see Tom do more on the front end of the channel
i love you matpat
Pls just stay we are gonna miss you
I hope you still make appearances in game theory every so often

……..
We will miss you so very much, last year was really tough for me and I had really bad grades and all my friends left me, but your channels were there to help me mentally and help me get an A in science class,and I would probably wouldn't have my best friend that we would practically be strangers if we didn't talk about our likings of  FNAF, I love and appreciate you, thank you. 🤍
yo
Thank You For Everything, Matpat...
No.
The old intro hit harder than anything right now
I’m going to cry, the classic intro is so nostalgic
im gonna miss you matpat, you never only made theory's you also made memories🥹

MatPat had tried to ruin childhoods, but instead he created them for us. Thank you MatPat and now you may rest now.
We got the Style Theory color on the wheel!
Counting down to the saddest day

This feels like the coming of rapture 😭 only nine videos left with matpat
Goodbye
That theme song is nostalgic

We are really on a mission that guy he was so smart and unfunny
Idgaf about Ban Ban, but I do wanna watch your last videos so I might as well watch this; I'm gonna miss you & I wanna see you before you leave, man.
Mat pat
I just realized one way that MatPat can hand over the authority of film theory he could have a theory about the new doctor who specials on Disney+, then at the end he could regenerate like the doctor does in the show, and regenerate into the new host of film theory
Bye mat pat
I have an idea: for the next nine episodes use every intro by order
Matpat you are awesome! 9 theories lets goooooo
that intro sent me back to my childhood
YEAA CLASSIC INTRO
YESSIR THE CLASSIC INTRO
The classic intro gave me CHILLS! I missed it so much
Seeing the internet collectively support MatPat restores my faith in humanity.

GT is going to fall off when matpat leaves
0:27 It’s such a small detail, but I love that the fourth quadrant, which used to be green since there were only 3 channels and then GT live, is now blue to represent Style theory. Having these last few episodes showing all four channels in the intro really warms my heart a bit
We will forever miss u MatPat ❤
Trip down the memory lane......i am gonna miss you matpat
From diving deep into the mysteries of video games to decoding the science behind pop culture, he's been more than just a YouTuber for me – he's been a guide through the uncharted territories of the internet during those formative years.
Goodbye matpat😟

<3
Seeing that intro... brought back so much nostalgia. We're all going to miss you matpat, thank you for everything. I wish the best for you in the future.
I hope that matpat’s last video is a remake of sans is ness

I wish you could have also become my childhood internet bestfriend
The classic Intro!!!! less go!!
Thank you for over 10 years of theories for all of our favorite games, you've been a big part of my and many mores childhood. We'll miss you and your hard work you've done. Much love, Mat.   -Your theorists
Gonna miss you mat, hard to see the person who literally introduced me to background lore in games leave.
The biggest mystery is where is chapter 5 ?
We are going to miss you so much matpat ❤️ you were a big part of my childhood and we will miss you❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for everything
That majora's mask  reference is cruel mat!!
We’re going to miss you so much matpat! Thanks for everything you’ve done for us

You were my childhood and i hope you're my child's childhood
best theory maker ever,we are going to miss you so much
I don’t care for BanBan but I’m cherishing These last 9 theories
Classic intro brought back memories
You know 1 is gonna be fnaf related it has to be
HA ONE OF THE LAST THEORYS ARE A BANBAN THEORY (we are going to miss you mat ): )
Can’t wait to see Tom start to lose his sanity
We'll miss you Matpat, especially your phrase "Remember, its just a game theory!"
We will miss you ❤

THE CLASSIC INTRO IS BAAACKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESS!
I always liked the original title card it brings me back when I was a little kid
Yes, they brought back the original intro🎉  Real sad that there are only nine videos left with matpat😢
Were gonna miss you
I feel like MatPat is fighting invisible demons trying to make any sense of this indie mascot horror slop for 9 year olds.  In no way Is this game worth a spot in MatPat's Final Ten.
The fruits of these final few theories are tumbling into our mouths too quickly
Had to be BanBan, lol. But, this is redeemed plus some through that intro's nostalgia...
I am going to miss you MatPat thanks for being part of my childhood you are a YouTube legend We all will miss you
im gonna miss matpat so much dude
hi🥰
The old intro hits way harder now...
OG INTRO
2,000 comments and it just came out 4 minutes ago..
Long live Matpat. You will be missed and honored, fellow soldier.
Ngl mat pat I will miss you so much when you quit this channel will not be the same but we will always remember you
The intro always slaps hard
it would be crazy if when he quit theres a ARG (also i love you matpat)
not gonna lie my jaw kind of dropped when the first theory before the retirement was about garten of banban
Matpat can you do a showbiz game theory video? Showbiz is this resturant from the 80's I think. Their a band of animtronics called the rock a fire explosion.
oh that intro hit the spot
Your my childhood hero
Goodbye the best man on the internet
all most me in march 9 🥹 🔫
I LOVE YOU MATPAT I WILL MISS YOUU
Bye Matpat I'm glad you brought back the og intro.
Bro when i saw that intro i cried🥲
LETS GOOOOOOOOO NEW EP
Omg, it's happening.
It's the final countdown ❤😢
Green red yellow blue
So, wait you've already made a theory but haven.t finished the game? Also, We'll all miss you I hope you show up In a theory in a distant theory.
Only 9!? I want more!?!??
i will miss you matpat
sad
Only 8 theories remain then we're going to miss you
I’m gonna miss you MATPAT 😢
I just feel sad watching this
Sometimes i would watch game theory just to listen matpat. Im gonna miss you hope all goes well in the future
I almost started crying when u played one of the old intros
I feel like all the missing him comments are great but I feel like they should only come once he is really gone until then let us treat it as old times like nothing ever happened and treat it like a normal theory and comment as if it was and when he’s gone we say our goodbyes and farewells BTW this seems like a great theory Matpat always loving your work.
i miss him already, i love you mat. thank you for my childhood.. i've continue too watch you for years and still do
I will always remember you. You were a really big part of my childhood. thanks❤
We are gonna Miss you
I don’t even like garden of ban ban but I’m watching because I’ll miss matpat!
Were gonna miss u😢
I feel so bad for matpat making this one of his last videos
Game theory will not be the same without you ❤
that old intro is so nostalgic
I will miss you matpat ❤❤
Before 5 minutes!! Also rip mat
Well miss you matpat
Farewell, MatPat. o7
Sad bye matpat
NOOO PLEASE NO DONT GO PLEASE DEAR GOD 😭😭😭
Woah that intro wow
The old intro 😭😭
I'm really praying he'll do a theory on Karl Jacobs Lost Tapes series before he leaves this channel! It would make me (and possibly some others) really happy and I've been waiting for this one since the Lost Tapes series aired!🥹  (Even if it doesn't happen, still, thanks for all the memories MatPat! You will be greatly missed❤)
I feel so lucky to grow up with game theory
We really gonna miss u matpat
THE CLASSIC INTRO!!!!
I'm going to miss you
It's just a theory....  a Game Theory ❤
Gonna miss you matpat. Been watching you for so many years. Happy to know you're taking a break now. Enjoy whatever you end up doing!
I have a theory: I think the final theory will be a FNAF theory (of course) But matpat would have solved the fnaf lore hopefully being confirmed by scott
MatPat, I grew up watching you. I'm so happy you were part of my life for so long it's sad to see you go, but we're all grateful for you guys. Thank you for everything. Theorist forever
if Tom doesn't use a matpat voice changer TGT is doomed 🙏
Man, i missed this intro and i will miis you MattiePattieUwU XD

You're a legend MatPat. You will never be forgotten. Thank you
Love to see that intro again
we will need another theorist who went mad over fnaf lore to replace you
Nobody cares about the game everyone is just sad that MatPat is leaving
We will miss you matpat😭
Seeing the old intro being used once more fills you with determination. 5 left.
We'll miss you mat
Ill miss your voice and little onscreen character
I wonder what the last one would be? A marathon of ALL theories?
Garten of banban chapter 173831653 when?

Hey, just wanted to drop a heartfelt comment here about how MatPat has been an absolute legend in shaping my childhood. 🌟 From diving deep into the mysteries of video games to decoding the science behind pop culture, he's been more than just a YouTuber for me – he's been a guide through the uncharted territories of the internet during those formative years.
We gotta watch all these 9 theories before the end
LETS GOOO ITS THE OLD INTROOO ‼️‼️‼️
You will be remembered matpat ♥️
Matpat you’re my game theorist
Abanban your hope all ye who enter here.

Let's see if mat can make a miracle and do the impossible that is saying the lore of banban  (There's no lore)
I don't have a long and carefully thought out piece of text ike the other comments, but MatPat you mean so much to me that seeing you leave GT and the other channels breaks me. But i'm glad you finally get to do what you wanted to do.  I wished i could have met you, or find a way to keep in touch someway, cause I can't let you disappear, i know you won't cause you still have your LORE-FI and Animation and your game.  But you'll be missed.  i've been holding out on this comment for 2  days now, cause I was hoping that this was all fake and unreal, but it's not.   Have fun doing your thing, you'll be loved  ---from Chimere
Were gonna miss you Matpat.

goona miss ya  you helped me heal and enter tain me when im recovering from my sugery
Hey Game Theory, I have a challenge for you. I saw in your video if Freddy killed Chuck E Cheese at 12:46 an anime figure from the comedy isekai anime Konosuba. Konosuba had a movie back in 2019 called Konosuba Legend of Crimson where at the end of the movie the explosion maniac of the group Megumin had decided to release her final explosion but when using saw that it was amped up by Kazuma the weakest member of their group and sort of love interest. In the final scene we see it from space and how big it was. Wanted to see if you could check how much tnt would be needed to make the same explosion. Bonus challenge if you could also see what it takes for MHA's explosion hero Bakugo to do the same level of explosion.
Do
this comment has been liked not enough
The old intro the best memory’s
Team theorist for life.
Nah dont tell me one of your last 9 theories will be a brainrot game.

Hey I have an idea make a playlist of all the Matpat videos so if we want to watch them they are easier to find
No please it's already starting. Not the 9 theory's left. 9 weeks left before you are finally gone and my life will be depressing asf
Seeing his intro finally after all these years is just so heartwarming yet sad Hopefully the next theories are also bangers!

Why there having to be only 10 Theories left with MatPat? Also can you make the intro a mix of every intro in the many theorist channels?
The classic intro nostalgia hit so hard 😔✊
Sad to see MatPat leave soon
I’m gonna miss you MatPat, thank you for everything you’ve done for this community. You were always and will be one of my favorite YouTubers.
9 theories left. 5 days to the party. Guess Mat took a page out of Scots book.  Miss you already man, and you haven’t even left yet!
I wonder if Matpat is quitting because he is tired of pretending like he cares about these type of games that are being made with the hopes he will makea theory about it.
I wish that Matpat wouldn’t leave doing theories
As much as I love the individualized intros, seeing the classic intro makes me happy.
Love ya mat u raised me when my parents couldnt
