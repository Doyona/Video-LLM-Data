Its will always be that same old guy Hamilton on top at the end of the year if they both had similar cars
Love seeing them together before the kettle boiled over later in the season.
This very interesting about how quick the Red bull and Mercedes are overtake in the Spanish grand prix.
1m20s admits if Lewis didn’t yield they crash 💥
Interest remarks about turn 1 there horner
Horner... Giant knob
Why can’t red bull just admit Lewis is better than than they thought and he is the one making the difference. Horner said in the same car max would win and max had a better car he doesn’t win as his race craft isn’t as good, he can’t look after tires. Let’s not forget each team has two drivers in the same car
Lewis's racing is years of experience, adapting and knowledge. But there is a lot more to that just driving fast. There is a lot of understanding of the track layout, tempts, pushing, sitting back etc. Max can't look after his tyres in front of Lewis, his only options are to do that extra pit or sit behind Lewis and jump him in the pits.
Just excuses from Christian as usual.  Has this man run his course at Redbull.
Nothing to do with the faster car it was strat all strat
4:46 Lool Leclerc in the background waiting for Horner and Wolff to start beefing
People seem to be quick to forgetting that this is almost a textbook copy of Bahrain a few races ago, Hamilton on the slower strategy in a slower race pace car and he still won. Why is that? He is miles better on his tyres than max is and extremely calm and collected. Max is fast but that is all he knows, when things don't start going his way he panicks which is always evident from the radios and he does not have the tyre preservation skills like Hamilton does.
I think Mercedez is making it look close just for the sport.
If RB can get the fastest lap there should be no excuses
Max would have had a better chance fighting on new tyres in that last stint when Lewis went in for his.  He was a sitting duck on those old tyres.  Second time this season for RedBull.  Going for faster lap doesn't help if you keep coming second.
He cut Louis of 😃 not nice well done Louis kick you arss and win😂😆😈
will never buy a merc ever, great merchandising... i dont like them much
Christian Horner tells it as it is , Lewis is not better than any other driver , he just has a faster car , it's been this way last 3 years now and new rules need to come in so no one has such a huge 1 second a lap advantage over all the other teams.
Why not put max in Mercedes team  with Lewis !! Let them have it with the same car !
Poor Horner wants nothing more than beating Mercedes haha
Mercedes are having success not just because of the car but because Lewis gets the best out of it. Poor Bottas looks like his days are numbered.
Red bulls strategy is full of holes !!!
Never liked Horner such a dishonest pretentious unfair and prejudiced  red bull team principle. Such a loser
Lewis must've been freaking when Max did him but he avoided disaster.
Get rid of the masks … we all know it was utter nonsense.
Lewis experience won the race... had it been anyone else in the first corner their ego would have got in the way and a collision would hv happened.
Lewis is a god............end of discussion.
I think what he means is Lewis was the faster driver
Poor team tactics from redbull cost max the race
Guy should be called honker
The fastest car won yet again, all terribly predictable !
Theres going to be one hell of a crash one of these days on take off theres only louise preventing it at the minute.another driver might not get out off the way in time
VBot just aint all that, max is quick, but not fast yet, and certainly not consistent...seb, who? The young man in the red car, not Carlos, the other one is just arrogant. I don't see any magic in young Mick, but we'll see... Perez is a great driver but sadly probably too old to get the shot at multiple tittles, cos he's not called verstappen...D Ric ah, shame, great driver, great bloke. If I was a betting man, lando is the one to watch for the near future, for now though, Lewis is going to be hard to beat. He's just on another level.
More of the same please from the two teams.
If Horner and Red Bull want to beat Mercedes they really need to recognise when they are wrong. Verstappen could have easily pitted like Lewis did and flipped the tables, instead of accepting this, Horner goes to say "Ah Merc's car is too good" and even if that's true (I personally don't agree with it) putting it all down to that is poor mentality.  The way that I see it, is with drivers and cars well matched, the Red Bull strategy let Max down. Not learning from mistakes will be costly and Max will be hoping that they do learn.
Horner is such a sore loser. Claiming MB had a quicker car which they did but not by much and on a track thats historically hard to overtake wasnt the decider. It was the strategy. He is saving face by trying to not admit his team got caught napping.
Was a great race and good to see the 2 team principals recognising and respecting each other's teams.
This season we're seeing how much difference a great driver makes to even the quickest car. If Bottas was Mercs number one, Verstappen would've won the first four races. If Perez was Red Bull's number one Mercedes would have had four 1,2 finishes. Perez and Bottas are very good, but great gets the job done.
All pre season it was said the red bull is faster than the Mercedes, what happened....
This was simply telling Lewis I am not a pussy so don't mess with me and when we are wheel to wheel look out fella cos I am not giving in !!!!!
The mind games 😂
Thank god I am not in any type of sport these days The media are a pain in the ass as far as i am concerned.. They just love DRAMA !!! Bottas has taken a hammering a real Hammering just imagine trying to do your best under this sort of pressure He aint the best but neither is Lewis if the truth were known but he is also not the worst and Lewis is a dam good driver so not a Lewis hater by a long chalk !! Mercedes team did a bloody good job and Lewis to be fair drove well to do what he did.. I like Christian I think he is an honest chap but in this instance he let his driver down they could have done it differently but they did not ..Max is a champ in the waiting but without support like Lewis has he will not get there thats for sure !!
I actually have lost it with Lewis, all that taking the knee and his dress code FFS. However, what is he employed to do? ....this he does better than anyone else and for that he should be respected as being the greatest racing driver ever. He actually talks better than he looks and acts. He would do really well in radio interview. He gets two thumbs up for his driving though every time.
if redbull was dominating horner would be rubbing it everyones faces
Totta: You never know how its going to end ?- Really. Having the fastest car gives you more choices which means you can switch strategy mid race.
Few minutes of chatting about 100x more interesting than the race.
I thought vastappens move into turn 1 was wreckless,I wonder what Christian would have said about had it been the other way round and Lewis ran Max off the track to get the position 🤔
Strategy - Red Bull let Max down
If they pitted max after Lewis then we really would have seen a great match up!
Why are they reinforcing Max’s aggressive behaviour?
Redbull feel a little silly because they thought they had won, and really they should of... Great strategy by the Mercs. And great drive by Lewis. 😁
Merc had a better strategy and driver  Fastest car my asre!!! That redbull got pace and max is no slouch!
Redbull could have won the race but they didnt.  'No Excuses'.
I would like to see young Russel in the 2nd  car could happen sooner than later
Have you lot not realised that Hamiltons comments about his tyres every race are to confuse his rivals who listen to his radio  There are obviously code words being used in Merc and "Bono my tires are gone" is code for something and the viewers clearly dont like that Hamilton says his tyres are "gone" when they arent😂
Ferrari team in the background like can we get involved please 🥴😂
Tyre Strategy blew up. They didnt think  Mercedes  would do that extra stop
Helmut ..this is why lewis gets paid
I'll  never watch the sport while lewis is in it
Ngl Max's driving only works bc it's hamilton
Redbull can't ever admit it's their fault. There is always another reason, never their responsibility, their car is at minimum equal and can get pole.
There hasn’t been any reason for the last seven or eight years because it was mind your tires mind your battery bullshit
People won't realise how good Hamilton is until he retires. People always hate the best!
Same old predictive crap.....
So Christian, why did Verstappen not do another stop as well, that would have negated what Hamilton did. As for the first bend overtake, Verstappen came from behind and forced Hamilton off of the track, that was not an overtake, that was barging a car off of the track, I don`t see how that is fair racing.
Let's ban radio and let the men sort themselves out from the boys and we might get some good racing instead of boring garbage.
Merc have the best car yet again...anyone who says otherwise is delusional or just a merc/Lewis fanboy...no wonders fans are turning off its just getting boring...
if Lewis had done that at the start there would be hell on  don't matter now cos Lewis was just a beast  P45 bottas
I think its hilarious that since the first day of the season all of the broadcasters have been hawking the same narrative of this immense and tight battle between Lewis and Max this year. It's all just hype to to increase interest and viewing figures to make up for the loss of revenues elsewhere in the sport. Lewis is dominating more than ever this season (when you consider that the Mercedes cars were hamstrung by the new regulations in the first races to deliberately slow them down for this season so the rest of the pack could catch up) I personally love the fact that Mercedes, Toto Wolff and Lewis dominate F1 regardless if the alternative is that an arrogant and self entitled driver like Verstappen and his equally arrogant boss Horner win instead. I'd rather Ferrari or McLaren were their rivals.
It’s not good for F1 at all one car domination it’s crap
It is really weird how Horner is ALWAYS at pains to blame Hamilton's wins on 'the car'. He regularly goes out of his way to try and make this point. They must have a really fragile mindset at Red Bull if they always have to push the narrative that Verstappen can only ever lose to an opponent who has a car which must be much "faster" than his.
How come red bull says thay where faster then max got the fastest lap
No he did not have a quicker car it was down to tactics which Mercedes did perfectly.dont make excuses.
How can anyone take F1 seriously when there are cars out there literally faster than the others. Joke of a sport.
It’s great racing
I'm glad Bottas didn't let Hamilton through too easily because it must absolute suck to be told to be moved out the way, I would be so angry if I was him
The first corner Lewis avoided crashing into max  If max wouldn't be avoid that
And that is why you need Lewis Hamilton
If Max wasn't so bullish in turn 1, he would have won, its called karma :).
When is Christian Horner going to admit that Lewis is a better driver? He always seem to try to discredit him when he wins a race. Let’s enjoy a superb driver!
I wish someone could explain how you can consistently have ten cars qualify within one second of one another, then on race day the top two cars are lapping the field by their forth lap...I just seems like a fix to me..I've lost interest again...and I'm not alone...
"They didn't have the tyre wear" - when you watch the smarter analysts they show how Hamilton's driving style loads the tyres less than Verstappen's... It was driver skill that won this race.
Red Bull have the faster car but Lewis is making up for the difference, Horner talking garbage as usual he just mad Lewis beat them again
Christian Horner is not Toto wolf,  period.
What I find amazing is how a change in diet can have such a dramatic effect on a man . Ever since Christian found he liked a little ginger on his sausage  he is a changed man .
they had a quicker car !!!    Excuses again.
I think Mercedes had a better strategy. It didn't come down to the car
Notice he said A quicker car not quicker cars 😂😂 poor Valteri
Verstapen has done it twice now, kicking Lewis of the track. When he does it people just say it's racing.
if hammy had the quickest car how come verst took the lead at 1st corner  and don't say well he braked later he was virtually level before the turn oh he had a better start  if hammys car is that quick  he could let him go 1st and get to the corner 1st utter crap the cars are level that how much RB have caught up  just bad strategy by RB  good strat by mercs  also drivers verst get hot headed  hammy cool  but both v/good  brill drivers verst just has to learn to cool down sometimes that's what hammy's learned
So what is the point in F1 now. Yet again the Mercedes band wagon turns up the wick and its bye bye 👋. Utter Bo...cks
Good to see Verstappen and red bull challenging Hamilton and Mercedes who have been miles ahead for years now.
Wonder if F1 had spotters like they do in IndyCar, Lewis might have had a chance to protect that first corner more effectively.
Some superb mature driving from Lewis,.
Ferrari watching from a distance . Red with envy.
Lewis is clearly among the very greatest, with Fangio, Senna, Schumacher- the only issue now is whether he is #1. He has been making a stronger case now- and for greatest British sportsman.
Bye bye Bottas
I don't know why so many people are thinking this is a really close season. Mercedes have already sorted their problems out and will continue to improve the car at a faster rate than Redbull.
I like how racing drivers and team bosses always say “they had the quicker car”...”we weren’t fast enough, clearly we have more work to do”, etc., but never say, “they have the quicker driver”...clearly I’m not as fast a driver as he is, I have a lot of work to do”
Sir Lewis Hamilton reigns supreme once again! Absolute dominance once again from the greatest racing driver of all time. Congratulations, Mercedes, and on to the next one!
Mercedes need to have a chat with Bottas and realign strategies. He needs to be a confirmed no.2 driver and to run a strategy that covers the late pit for a fastest lap attempt.
Let's be honest if this season shows anything it's just how far Bottas is from being an elite level driver. Lewis is using the same car as him to beat Verstappen, yet Verstappen makes Bottas look slow in pretty much every race. If I was Mercedes I'd be thinking very seriously about how soon I could move Russel up from Williams. Yes, Bottas has far more experience than him, but let's be honest, Russell is over performing every race in the slowest car on track while Bottas is clearly not getting the best out his car.
Looking at the overtake in the first corner, I wonder what the response would be if Hamilton had made that move on Verstappen?
Personally cant stand hamilton and I'm bored with mercedes dominance - but with weekends like this Red Bull are making it reeeaallly hard to support them fully honestly. Get a grip and make decisive decisions for once
It seems poor strategy from Redbull to go with exactly the same response that lost them the race last time they were in this situation. Surely it was worth doing a response pit and come out a few seconds behind Hamilton rather than inevitably allowing Lewis to glide past at the end when Max's tires were all shot.
I am confused, during quali, redbull was tipped to lead, now horner is say they were slower than Mercedes, if if it was then bottas would have closer or ahead of max
Class Act both of them ultimate respect for each other ! Mercedes slightly edging it each week at the moment - but it’s getting closer ! Brilliant stuff !
one question how the hell did Mercedes fix the errors of pre season
Again that second Red Bull car is Max’s downfall
Lewis will always win as his car is faster simple. Put max in his car and Lewis in Max’s car and u see max will win all the time.  It’s getting so boring now
Horn is a bellend
Blinkin heck! Horner giving Lewis and Toto a real compliment. His sour is turning to respect maybe? About blinking time.
Horner is wrong, Lewis was always going to pass Max, he was less than half a second behind Max when Max pitted, then after Mercedes didn't capitalise on their chance to take the lead and left Lewis out, he then caught up to Max again and was .8 of a second behind before Lewis pitted, and then, after recovering the 22 second deficit Lewis cruised passed Max as he did Valtteri. On the day Lewis was the fastest driver as the cars were evenly matched.
Horner thinking they couldn't have done anything different.  Max was quick enough to win. His team left him down.
Why didn't red bull bring max in a lap after Lewis for new tyres,? Then he could have kept the lead.
Only thing I'm enjoying this year is its slot closer but it's still dull as hell with 2 drivers up top.  I'd wager you put every F1 driver today into the exact same car and this wouldn't be the outcome but unfortunately that'll never happen
Where’s Ted’s notebook?
Horner just making excuses as usual. Great reposte from Toto. Had Max reeled Lewis in like that, he'd be singing a different tune. Funny how the slower car set the fastest lap.   Hats off to Lewis. RB got schooled.
A body language expert would say Horner was uncomfortable here because he was self soothing by stroking his arms etc 🤔
It's almost as if Horner is TRYING to out himself as a complete simp, couldn't hype up Max any more and then throws him under the bus by basically saying they lost the win because he pitted unexpectedly. CHARLATAN
Hamilton is the ultimate driver I m so glad he s getting to prove that this year. all this bollocks its his car. all the greatest drivers end up in the best seats he s up there with the greatest of all time.
This is everything that's wrong with formula 1,  Whats the point of having a talented driver like max  when Lewis can drive a car that can make up 22 seconds with 6 half laps to spare, the performance difference is killing F1 , just makes a farce of the sport,
I thought we were in for a great battle when Lewis caught Max, I was gearing up for a right ding dong! But I forgot about DRS... Before DRS a car on old tyres had a slim chance of holding on if they battled well, and we would see a great fight. Not anymore. Yes we get more overtakes now, but they are artificial overtakes with no skill or excitement, and who wants that.
I think Bottas is good man + driver but his  don't have  confidence!!
ANO Seriously predictable F1 race....was sooooo boring.....I switched over to watch the movie on ITV4  Return of the Magnificent Seven.....much more interesting 🧐
Christian 'I'm so posh I need 2 pinky rings' Horner. What a total prick. No wonder he married page 3 classless spice!
They didn't ask Toto about Bottas 🤔
Who was the guy toto high fived in the garage immediately after Lewis crosses the finish line..?
You know Horner is thinking “Smug P***k”
Another boring season where Mercedes are just so far ahead, any top 10 driver could win in the Mercedes.
Did Red Bull have an option to pit Max around Lap 42/43 before Lewis did it? Especially given the gap behind. I'm confused why Horner didn't mention it as an option.
Max works his tyres harder than Lewis, If the race comes down to wear then Lewis should always beat him, With time Max will adapt his driving style, But you have to be better than Lewis, Not just very lucky and rely on engine failures to win a championship like Rosberg.
IMO, I think Redbull wasn't reactive to Lewis's second pit stop whatsoever. They saw Ham come into the pits and froze... they could have let verstappen go on a little bit longer on mediums, then pit with like 12 laps to go or something, put softs on while sacrificing track position and have verstappen catch hamilton, same exact way hamilton caught up to verstappen. I think there was still time. it would have probably given Ver a fight with Ham by the last laps of the race, instead of gambling on those 10000 lap old mediums, while Ham was on a fresh set...   Im no expect and I may be wrong, but I really do feel like there was time for a similar strategy.
The tyre wear isn't necessarily due to the car. Hamilton has always been great at managing tyres even if he does moan to Bono a lot 😂
Why are the idiots wearing masks in the open air? The level of political correctness now in F1 makes me want to puke.
I don't like Max he is to aggressive towards other drivers. This not the first time that he runs his opponent out of the race luckily its Lewis Hamilton and he knows how stupid Max is
Yet just before Lewis 2nd pit, he couldn’t go pass Max in a straight, at 7 tenths behind and with DRS. Chris and Max fans want to convince us that Lewis’s car still the fastest when the Numbers and the video evidence don’t lie.
Can't watch F1 anymore as There's no real competition to Hamilton , I think it's time to bring back the old V10 F1 cars from 2008 and then we will see closer races
It's always Lewis gad the quickest car 😆 Redbull has the fastest car from the start of the season, but Mercedes has the fastest driver 👑
This removed me of what Ferrari and Schumi were able to do qualifying laps in the race to make the strategy work
Red Bull really need to concentrate on engine performance, that Honda unit is awful, it has no pace compared to the Merc. The way the hypocrite went past Max was embarrassing
This is why Lewis is the best, if that was Lewis coming up the inside of Max, Max would of crashed into him Lewis has the maturity and the confidence in his ability to play the long game without mistakes.
Merc never signed Bottas to be anything other than a number 2 driver after the mad battle between SLH and Rosberg , he has  made the most of it with many wins but his time is soon
lmao 6:18 Lewis in the air, in a white suit? and crowds galore? thats not from todays race lmao. He has a black suit, doesn't have a red helmet, its purple black.
I think that was a classy response from both team bosses and just how sport should be. Go hard at the contest but be respectful of each other at the end. 👌
Hey Mrs. Ginger Spice ...it’s Formula 1 ...nothing is EASY. Better man than me is Toto
Why should bottas let Lewis have it easy. This is what’s wrong with f1. It should be hard not easy
Considering Bottas couldn’t get past or follow Charles, they didn’t have the quickest car... they had the quickest driver.
If Hamilton was in the red Bull and leading then he would have won.
I see lots talk about bottas and how he didn't play the team game, If he did he would not be a racing driver in my eyes , any driver would struggle against Lewis or verstappen for they are two very talented drivers by the way I am a Lewis fan but respect other  drivers for without them.  they'll be no race
Yet again Red Bull's strategy stuffed Max they should have boxed him the lap after Lewis.
I don't get why they are expecting a real fight between Lewis and Max.  The Merc is clearly the fastest car.  Max will only win if Merc make a mistake
Hamilton is the absolute master. Verstappen the future. Two superb drivers.
shows how good the mercs and lewis are, horner was mesmerised by their performance at the start of his interview
A safety car might have made the difference,but we will never know.
Max is my favourite driver. Love his attitude.
The red bull just doesn’t have the performance on twisty tracks, The less technical tracks like spa and Monza, should be better, but on most tracks Mercedes have performance advantage.
Why would Lewis retire when he is still in his prime? The man has the chance to set a record which may not be broken for decades, if I where him I wouldn’t stop till I hit 10 titles at-least.
Bet all sky sports paid employees r on piss now 4 ,,,2 week
Lewis!! this man is not given enough credit. Absolute Legend.
Of course Horner would say Merc have had it easy the last 5 years, he’s saying that only because his Red Bull team & Max were practically nowhere to be seen in the 2017 & 2018 seasons, when Ferrari & Vettel *should* have wrapped up both titles, if not for LEWIS HAMILTON, & today yet again he proved why he is the. 🐐 Horner was far too busy nurturing golden boy Max & trying to demote Danny Ric to number 2 status in the team, love Ricciardo for not taking any of it. He did the right thing leaving but i wish he’d found a better seat. Now the car is so built around Max no matter who is in the 2nd Red Bull seat, they cant drive it to their limit & do their jobs properly. Red Bull need to be careful this season because Max is now in a personal battle against Hamilton for the WDC, but Perez is nowhere to be seen, practically left to the Dogs which are Ferrari & McLaren.. 2 STRONG teams that are no doubt going to catch up with development. Red Bull could end up 4th in the constructors.. 😂
All these Hamy lovers. Open your eyes and see that he's driving the fastest car by far. Bottas is not up to scratch but put Norris, Russell or Ver in a Mercedes and they would win too.
When is people just gonna say Hamilton is a level above Max? This feels very similar to 2018 With Lewis against Vettel
You lost so stfu
Listen I have an idea all cars are made exactly the same, then we would have a race instead of those 4 cars Merc and red bull  ffs......You know all these teams spend millions of  ££££ yet none of them really make a profit, most just break even...
I would give a pinky to see both in the same car
Why are these clowns still wearing masks? Pushing the MSM narrative much? 🙄🤡🌍
He didn’t have a quicker car, Max was a good 1.5 seconds ahead already in the first 2 laps. Your strategy didn’t just work simple Max led more that 75% of the race how could Lewis have had the faster car?
Not a great overtake by Max on turn 1 - he moved into Hamilton and didn't leave him any room. Not even a discussion.
Congratulations to Lewis and Mercedes on the win 👏🏼 Mercedes do have the quicker car, that’s becoming apparent but only marginally but it is the fastest car. Max is doing exactly what he needs to do, don’t take risks, take second, collect the points and wait for someone else to make a mistake, there’s nothing more he can do. Mercedes have the better car. But we’re only 4 races into a long season the DWC isn’t won yet by a long stretch, the order could change in just a few races, all to play for, keep pushing Max/Redbull 💪🏼🧡
Sore loser, Horner. Yapping on about a quicker car!
Such a shame that the sport has come to this kind of contrived boring and predictable "racing". It could have been sooooo much better.
They have great respect for each other it seems
The way jenson buggered off hahaha "I don't want this smoke!"
Great win for Lewis and bottas driving for Mercedes is coming to an end!!! To here him at the start of the season saying he’s going for the championship this year it’s like yeah ok then valteri how delusional!!!! Your just not good enough your not on that level I’m afraid and to top it off your up against the best f1 driver there’s ever been as your team mate just look at Lewis results to his in the same car and to be fair he didn’t set the world alite when he was at Williams before getting the most prized seat in f1. Mr Russell would be doing a much better job no problems.
You had a crappier strategy
Absolute slam on checo
“You had a quicker car” that’s their excuse.  No, Mercedes just have the better driver and used better tactics to get the win
The only thing surprising  about this result is bottas couldn't get second!
If Perez was there to help Max, Lewis wouldn’t have been able to two stop
Leclerc standing in the back arms crossed 😂
Sorry Cristian but you could have stopped and changed tyres.
Why wear a mask outside?
The battle between Lewis and Max is immense this season! Both complete class acts, operating at the peak of their powers. Always right on the limit but also always fair to each other. I'm a Lewis fan at heart, but I have huge respect for Max and rate him extremely highly. Long may this battle continue!
Realistically the Redbull and Mercedes are very close pace wise but Hamilton’s strategy and driving won him the race fair and square. Max and Horner should just admit they were outplayed today
I think you only have to look at AMR and how much they’ve been dented to get an idea of how much the merc package has been dented this year. Merc are simply nailing it and getting everything out of their team. RB have a better car but are not maximising each race
Well Horner should have covered 2nd pit stop of mercs,I don’t think Horner believes that much in Max for them tp do the 2nd stop
Toto is happily letting Horner/Helmut/Max bleat on about not having the fastest car despite starting the season with just that! He is very wise indeed not to get involved, shows his experience. Rules were changed which suited them, they have taken advantage of those rule changes but now Mercedes have pulled their way back.  I wonder how Toto really feels about Horner poaching their Power Unit staff?? It seems frosty, albeit professional.
Loved the handshake between Toto & Christian. Respect on and off the track from both teams
The BLM whopper gets lucky again.  Never has there been a more undeserving world champion.
Red Bull with fast car but not faster driver... No one like Lewis Hamilton 💪
Just leclerc back there 😂😂😂
Red Bull dropped the ball with regards to pit strat. Max did everything he could but they didn't pit him when he had 20+ seconds on Lewis.
Two brilliant teams and drivers. Love the respect ✊
I’m sure these guys have been vaccinated, do they really needs the masks, outside?
Told you all, Mercedes had a rough pre season testing session that was all. Now they are on top of the car and season is over. Told you Mercedes would win, the signs were there at Bahrain. Red Bull won't be able to catch them because the development momentum will be with them now. People got excited over Red Bull, talking about rake etc. The Mercedes is a fundamentally fast car they needed a race or two to learn what they should have done in winter testing. Barcelona has always been a bell weather track for knowing which cars are strong and will win at the end of the season.
I feel bad for Bottas. Cursed to be a #2 driver forever :(
Why did seeing that Hungary 2019 replay feel so odd
Horner thinking we need to poach the strategy team as well 🤔
LeClerc Russell at Merc, Bottas and Lateffi at Williams...Ham and Sainz at Ferrari - bring it on!
Think Redbull should change tyres when Merc do and then let Max do the rest.  How the hell can max win on ancient rubber.
Horner is becoming a very annoying dickhead. Max takes his beating like a true man. Horner on the other hand is just waffling about "free pit stop". Why didn't they bring Verstappen in after Lewis pitted?. There was nothing to lose, he would have been behind Hamilton, but with an outside chance of victory. Instead they brought Max in just to try for a fastest lap. That magnifyed their beating.
Its a shame that Lewis is such a fcuking dickhead.
I worry for Verstapen's mental state after this season. Lewis does not just beat you physically, he breaks your spirit too you end up wanting to quit. Just ask Alonso and Rosberg. And he is very cold hearted and methodical when he does it. In particular when you disrespect him like Verstapen did last year.
BORING!!!!!
Quicker driver!
Gentalmen first and rivals second, lovely to see! Examples of true sportsman not many other sport where managers would sit together and talk through the race/game
never been a fan of horner
You watch in the next 3/4 races the same first corner incident will happen again but this time Lewis will be on the inside and Max on the outside but Max will not yield
Toto and Arnie are just one degree of separation apart...
Bottas here is 15500 RPM,  Lewis here is 16000 RPM we will make you win at any cost, don't worry lewis baby we have you covered.
Love that Leclerc is hovering in the background like "hey, one of you hire me please"
Horner just likes to kiss Max's ass everytime he gets a chance. Stop hyping this dude. He's just an aggressive driver with a car tailored made for him who can't grasp the idea of tire management and just goes ham on the throttle. Hardly champion material.
Pathetic excuse from Horner as usual. These two administrators are the biggest narcissists in sport. They wouldn’t have lasted 5 minutes when F1 was still about racing.
"they followed so closely..."  Lewis can do that, Bottas can't. Same thing at Portimao - Lewis could follow closely and neither Verstappen nor Bottas could.   Anyone else see what I'm seeing? We can call it "faster car" but it's not that.
Hamilton is all Class  Max is full of Gas
If Lewis was a hot head him and Max would have been out of the race at the first corner but a seven time World Champ knows the race isn't won at the first corner and why get a dnf and hand the points to another driver, this is what puts him head and shoulders above the rest.
If they had a quicker car bottas would be 2nd.  They have a quicker driver
Max should of covered Lewis straight away
Monaco should be a great contest, But i cant wait for Silverstone, half a million plus crowd should be epic.Another Lewis masterclass today, what a racing driver.
Max could crash the car into the wall and Horner would say the wall crashed into Max. Excuse merchant.
It’s still obviously early days. The cars are near enough equal in my view, if anything it was Merc who are now slightly faster. But Red bull are notoriously slow starters, and they’re development speeds up later in the season. And plus, red bulls strongest tracks haven’t come up in the Calendar yet. Hopefully we are in for some more exciting racing throughout the season.
Max gets fastest lap.  "They had a quicker car"-RB
Stop with the excuses--RB car just as good as the Merc
Horner and Wolff were oddly friendly and patting each other on the back "you were great" " thank you but you were great too" aww so sweet, even Ham and Max have been shaking hands and chatting like best buds this year, where has all the little digs gone from last year ?  Though Bottas is the same quiet one not joining in, I think he knows this is probably the last year in the car, he's never going to win the championship with Ham next to him, and we know Russell is destined for one of the seats.  Maybe Bottas can go on to being the next big Finnish head playing musician.
Its very simple lewis has a better car than every other driver everyone saw that last season when Russell nearly won the race when Lewis was out with covid he will never be considered 1 of the best when his car so much better than the rest its becoming a joke
As I keep saying max he’s not ea it’s not he’s ear !! Still I rise 💪🏿 we see you max 👍🏿🔥
Yes, Mercedes had the quicker car. And that's ENTIRELY down to Horner. He's the boss.
Horner just face facts mate
Back handed praises. People forget that until 2-3 years ago, Ferrari had the best car. Still trying to diminish Hamilton's achievements smh. Bottas has the same car, how come you can beat him then if it's all about the car?
Tired of Horner using the excuse that Mercedes have a quicker car if RB lose , but Max is a genius if he wins
3:00 20% AI? You know not who you are dealing with!
So, who's going to start bitching about Lewis, for been deserving winner..?
You see this is why Lewis Hamilton will forever be the best in F1 history like him or loathe him. Max thinks skillful driving is dangerous driving where the safety of the other car/driver is irrelevant and always want to prove a point. Lewis on the other hand understands that skillful driving is NEVER PUT YOURSELF/CAR IN A POSTION WHERE YOU COULD BE CRASHED OUT OF A RACE. Reason he is the best of the two and the best out there is that....he knows how to live to fight another day. He will let you pass esp when you are driving dangerously but know this...he will always come for you in the same race or the next. What a legend.
Bottas battling Lewis instead of letting him past tells me he's done at Mercedes
Clearly you could see both cars have similar race pace but lets not forget Hamilton is better at getting speed out of his tyres and keeping them together.  Max keeps swiping across Hamilton in battles like a entitled brat and still loses in the end its hilarious.  Its total disrespect to hamilton to assume because he 7 time world champion is able to follow within 1 sec of a hothead crash monger that was only down to a car advantage.
Bottas you complete A hole, trying to hold your own team mate up to stop him getting victory. I used to like you but I've lost all respect and hope you end up at Haas.
They didn’t have a quicker car. They had superior strategy and better driver.
Everyone saying it’s a faster car like bottas isn’t driving the exact same car, lmao🤣
Surprised Max wasn't penalised for the first bend manoeuvre ?  Can't do that to sir Hamilton!  Not proper,  not in the script.
Horner made the mistake that lost them the race. Should have called Max in. What an excuse “they had a quicker car”
Why does Toto sound a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger
RB have a car which is brutally fast over one or at most a very few laps. Mercedes have developed a car which is fastest - by quite a margin over a race distance - IF DRIVEN SMOOTHLY. And who do they have to drive it? Mr Smooth-but-Quick, the Brown Fox. Mercedes aero engineers have a driver that delivers for every little advance they give him.
Rule changes are the only thing that has made Red Bull catch up and Merc also has the more consistent and better driver in Hamilton.
Max also had track position 🤷🏾‍♂️😃😃😃😃
Bla bla bla F1 sucks There is no competition is dol 🤮😭
'When Hamilton wins, its faster car, when Max wins its pure skills' tired of this excuse. Hamilton is head and shoulders above the rest of the driver on the grid. Red Bull were 0.0036 slower on pole lap yet when Hamilton wins, its FASTER CAR. Max had faster car in Bahrain yet lewis won it. Typical Red Bull move trying to find excuse in anything but Max.
lol it's funny seeing a driver just standing at the side waiting. I assume Leclerc was talking next? 4:34
I can see Lewis not getting out if it one time when Mad Max keeps chopping him at the start. Up to now Mad Max has just left it up to Hamilton to decide if they have an accident or not but once there is enough points in the bag Hamilton will just stick to his line and as Horner said “put him in the fence” !!
Max is in fact a dirty driver,  confirmed.
OMG!!!The faster car narrative is so feckin played out!!! Red bull had the fastest lap record so what are we talking about here! Lewis is the better driver PERIOD! Give him the credit!!
Love this video, Christian Horner magnanimous in defeat and great respect from Toto Wolf. This is racing at its best, its going to be a fantastic season & the future of F1 is only getting more exciting. Thank you @skyf1 for the brilliant coverage.
who's the kid toto high fives at 3:46?
Every time Lewis tells Bono his tyres are shot , he then starts doing purples 😈😈😈
Christian Horner is a shite manager Period! Blames everyone else but himself! He changes drivers like he changes his nappy! He won’t be able to get the best out of a decent driver even if it donkey punches him every second of the hour! 🐈
Imagine max in the other merc, he would force Hamilton to take early retirement
Bottas wasn't fast.
Did anyone else think that Bottas not getting out of Lewis' way was the action of a man who knows his P45 is in the post?
Pathetic excuses, sour grapes by Horner. Yes Mercedes were quicker but not significantly, this is a difficult track to overtake on.  Strategy makes the lion share of difference and Mercedes nailed it, you guys didn't, just be honest, you didn't have the strategy and the one stop you did have, you bottled. Wake up ffs. Max did everything he could and you fell short.
Yes a big win, but Mercedes being able to follow so close, if they can continue to do that every race, they have great car 🤔
When Lewis wins it’s the car when max wins it’s pure skill. Max is under performing     Merc was quicker but you still have to win it’s double standards which is my point before all the WTF1 She/hers get on my back
Yet if it was the other way round he would be saying max is a genius... Brilliant drive yet again from probably the greatest sportsmen the UK has ever seen.
Get in there Lewis your the man. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👍
Hornet can't use that quicker car BS anymore well established the cars are very near equal and simply Mercedes as a team are just better as well RB needs to stop excuses and improve ad a team as well
Not a good pit strat good race for not loads of overtaking opportunity
As a F1 principal you shouldn't be caught saying that as  an excuse for their win. Whose fault is it they have a quicker car?? When you had a quicker car than redbull only a month ago.
Congratulations Lewis 👍👌👍👌👍👍👌👍👌
Safety car killed Max's race.
ferrari strategists replaced red bull strategists today
Well done to Hamilton i was supporting leclerc
Red bull are quicker in general this season, it’s just Hamilton is a genius driver  And the merc team are imo clearly better, Lewis is thanking the team after every race bc he knows how vital everyone and the strategy they set are. Redbull need to take more responsibility- Lewis is just a better driver atm, I have no doubt he’d also win in the Redbull car with his team behind him too
