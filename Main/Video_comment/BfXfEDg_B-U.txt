Get extension cords so you can plug in more stuff
Kesley you can get an extension cord for your night stand
I recommend getting jars for the candy.
Extension cords are a lifesaver lol

Are you sharing am actual room with Hannah? Or just the apartment?
“I am not smart I was just thinking” -cory…. that had me laughing so hard!!
Hey kes you can use a surge which is basically a plug where you plug it on the wall and it comes with more plugs(i dont really know how to explain it but you can search it up and you’ll see what its like)
Get a rod and some cute curtains for the closet! You can close the curtains to make the room look less cluttered and just cuter!
For your hair stuff, you should do a small three drawer cart to help organize in that corner, target has a bunch!!
Remember your alarm clock will charge your phone!

Best tip: Make it YOUR space ❤🥰
power strip!!! best thing ingot for my college house this year!
I don't know if this is just me but she looks like pressely hobsach
Got my son’s lamp on Amazon and it had a place to plug in his phone charging cord.
Move over the dresser towards closet it’ll give u a little room
You could get a power strip for your outlet if you need to plug more things in!
I love your  cute  hair.  Beautiful girl. Beautiful  bedroom.  Sending lots of love from nz  you should  put led lights  in your bedroom  that would  look so cool.   You got such  a sweet roommate.   Xx  keep up  VIDEOS. Is do a food collage  food haul.  Love following  your collage  journey
Could u plz do a day in life if like u going to school…I just love watching those videos to keep me motivated to keep doing school!!!
in the Netherlands we have this thing called a 'verdeeldoos', which is basically a splitter for you outlet (a power strip in English). I would really recommend getting one, so you can recharge your phone, camera, laptop, put in your alarm clock etc. all at once, without having to take out the lamp
Maybe put the stuff in your "crap" drawer in a bin under your bed? This way you have an empty drawer for more clothes.
Can’t wait for more of your videos
Good luck in your college life,Kesley xx
Why don't you get yourself a power strip or or a extension cord to plug more stuff in .
Use poster putty for pictures
put led lights in your room !
This is so exciting for you! I still remember my 1st college apartment & I’m gonna be a senior now 😭 my number one tip is plan out most of your meals & meal prep during the weekend!! Trust me, it’s so easy to resort to take out all the time bc you don’t have time to cook everyday. Not only will that quickly make you feel like crap, it’s also so much more expensive than cooking at home
Best tip get curtains for your closet Best thing I have ever done
Lol, so disappointed that cory didn’t show us his ootd😂
Yesss do grocery haul and video of puttin everything away
Can’t wait to se your college journey ❤
You should get a curtain over your closet so you aren't looking at all your clothes and it looks cleaner
YES YES YES i loove cleaning/ organizing vids !💗
you need one of those things that you plug into both outlets to make it have 6 plugs and to USB plugs
Definetly get a power strip for behind your night stand or something that plugs in with multiple outlets
I just really got into books not that long ago and I was thinking of buying it ends with us, so it just shocked me that u had that book in your hand 😭✋
use an extension cord
You should get an extension cord so that you plug in your clock / phone or other stuff to plug in if needed!!!!  :)
for the charging thing im sure you figured it out but i think i remember you saying the clock charges your phone? i could be wrong haha
A power strip is going to be your best friend! Also command hooks were a must for me! They make ones for posters too that you could use for your pictures.
Get an extension cord so you can have extra plugs
EXTENSION CORD!!!
ahhhh I cant belive your  in college!!!!!! I remeber when you were 13 and you guys were living in the old house. Also its so sad that in The Leroys you wont be in the videos as much 😭But as long as your home for the Holidays/christmas it'll be all ok ! LYSM
Hey Kesley! You said you only have to outlets why don’t you get a extension cord! Btw I love how you decorated it! It’s such a cute aesthetic vibe! Love your vids btw!
There’s chargers that plug I the the wall then has a bunch more outlets connected literally a life saver for me
Power strip works wonders! Also what pudy did you use because I wanna hang stuff on my bedroom walls but my wall are textured! What kind do I need that works best?
U could put Ur candy and snacks in the empty bin under Ur bed
You should get that ikea trolly to store your hair stuff, it would fit perfectly there.
I use to have a high school musical lamp
get a power strip
hey kesley you should buy a wall changer that has multiple charger spots like 4 in 1 then you won’t have to always mess around with the cords
Putty leaves oil marks on the wall
You can get a power cord box that plugs into to the outlets! I have one and it’s not bulky like an extension cord and will stay hidden which is nice! Also you guys should get a curtain to put over your closet that would be so cute!
You should buy on on the walls plug in the has multiple so you can put your charger, clock, and lamp at the same time
I thought your alarm clock has a charger on top for your phone? or i think that’s what you said! just a thought for you charging your phone
cory in jordan’s>
Kesley u should get a charger strip this way u can charge ur phone and have the lamp and alarm clock plugged in
Kesley!! PLEASE do a video on how you put your photos up on the wall please! 💗
First day of college was so scary for me but I’m getting use to it
Get a surge protector to put in the outlet by your bed, it will protect everything from a power surge and give you more spots to plug stuff in
You could get a bed skirt! If you find one king enough it’ll cover the bins under the bed
Love itt!!!! U should get an extension cord for more plug
They have multi plug cubes! You just plug it into one outlet but it has a few on it and you can charge more things!
love the room! try using a extension cord!
If you want more outlets you can get a white extension cord. Just I an idea love the video. 💕💕
If you can I’d get some skinny plastic or flat pack draws to go by your bed and dresser so you can put your candy and other stuff in it x
For your hair stuff get like one those plastic small dressers maybe put it in the corner!! Would be cute and not messy at all
Best suggestion to hang things…green painters tape (the frog one) and it seriously is super strong and everything! Easy removal. I didn’t like putty because you need to remove it right or it will peel off paint.
loved seeing your move in process and how supportive your whole family is in sending you off to college!! <3
Are you going to have a roommate like y’all sleeping in the same room or and btw the pictures are cute love tou
Jesus loves you❤️
It ends with us is such a good book, what do you think of it?

Love you
I’ve been loving these videos 🥰
love her! “guys i’m in the dollar section  *finds 🎃* guys it’s only a dollar!”
I think you should put the stuff in the bottom drawer in the bin under your bed so that you have more space in the drawer for clothes!
🍃🍃🍃💝💝🌺🌺🌺🌺📿
You could get these bed risers to put underneath your bed so it makes it so you have more room!! Trust me my sister used them all the time in college.
I have the same lamp
you could maybe put all your hair stuff into the other gray bin you have?!
Use the command poster strips for the pictures or anything that command strips to hang up anything they don’t damage your walls and are way better than tap
It ends with us is the best book i loved it!

What college are you going to?

get a trolly for your hair stuff
Kess you can get a extension cord in so you can plug in all your stuff
you should def get a power strip and/or extension cord
Get an extra outlet connector
Kes, get a power strip or two. I did that in college  The long duvet hanging over could be good. It'll cover what's under the bed.   Get a tiny plastic bin for the candy. If you leave it in your room, it'll smell and invite bugs, etc.  Buy paper towels, wipes, hand sanitizer etc. Have basic meds, bandaid, period supplies. I suggest a pain reliever and Pepto.   I think the bin your hair stuff is in is nice. Up to you.
For your hair stuff you could always take a cute ribbon and hang it in the closet or the space between the dresser and the closet with a command hook and clip your bows and hair clips on them
Yes grocery hall please also I have a castify case and I lOVE it
My favorite season is fall two
Your room looks great Kesley...You should get multi plug outlet and some of them have USB adapters on them so you can charge your phone and have a couple extra outlets.
You can buy a plug w multiple connects so you can plug everything near ur night stand !💗
