We need Tommy in movies!!
Jada treats Will like Shanann treated Chris.
Tommy is funnnny as hell
Maybe it wasn't the producers that lied.... maybe Jayda was the LIAR all along🧐 She obviously gets immense joy from emotionally destroying her husband publicly. Jayda is abusive, and downright sickening.
He became human and got scared of his wife belittling him on the way home for not defending her hair.
Man fuck this news lady for pushing him the way she did laughing during an interview have some respect wtf tryna stir up drama
I just love HIS CRYSTAL CLEAR VOICE - you go MAN!
Seems like Will likes to pick on people smaller than he is...wow such a man...smh
Mr. Davidson,I wish someone could explain to Will how hitting someone is never the answer! And when done in anger it’s even worse! I lost my hearing with just several slaps like that from my ex-husband & for Denzel & others to blame the “devil”for their actions is ludicrous! Chris Rock is my new hero! And for Will to get a standing ovation? Dear god! It made me so sick to my stomach!
SHE didn't know that they were brothers? Chris Rock/Tony Rock? Hello‽
Will would have been justified in knocking out Tommy Davison, since that was a breech of consent. Kind of weird that in hindsight he didn't realize he committed sexual assault.  He's blaming producers, but why didn't he talk to jada about the kiss? He talked to her about the ending but not the kiss? Seems predatory to me. Disappointed in his insight in an age where we have a better understanding of consent. He calls Will a bully when he had the right reaction to predatory behavior. Smh
For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Matthew 6:14-15 NIV  FOR ME, as a Christian, I forgive you Wil Smith. I know you're remorseful for what you did. You are forgiven. May God bless you.
Jada been this way since she was in junior or high school
Will smith is a punk
EVERYBODY SAW HALLE BERRY GET ASSAULTED AT THE OSCARS AND No one said SHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Canceling is too binary.  We should not support this behavior though. The tough question is for how long, what if he never repents or apologize, what if it's fake apologies. We should be understanding of people's mental problems, but it crosses a line when it affects other people, especially physically. Can we separate the art from the artist.
So she does have the ability to stop her husband….interesting.
She lied when she said she remembers that
All the sudden all people have something to say about Will Smith because he defend it his wife,move on
Is it darn shame that y’all just keep coming through for Will Smith and making money off of him by using his name out of your mouth now he’s a bully how come none of y’all were seeing this stuff before this incident now all of a sudden a whole bunch of things you’re talking about them that’s just crazy to me and I can remember when Will Smith first started out on the fresh prince show a lot of people rappers were upset about that because they looked at him being a corny rapper like he shouldn’t of got what he got that show and people disliked him for years like come on man this is wrong very wrong for years he had to deal with a lot of things
Will Smith is a punk!
Most people say wouldn't harm a fly flea she sounds drunk and Joan Riverish  buts she no  Joan rip
Will's temper is worrying. Easily triggered over things that can be discussed in a normal conversation.
I could watch 2 hours straight of Tommy running from Wanda.
Good job will smith I'm on his sii
Tommy did a great interview. She sucks! Energy was off, she was looking for drama, just was a weak host.
Will feels entitled
Had him in my limo a few times, a really friendly down to earth guy....a little tight with the tip🤣....there it is, I threw him under the bus! Good tippers Forest Whitaker, Lee Trevino, George Hamilton....bad tippers Edward Norton, Dennis Rodman, Fergie  black eye peas, Rob Schneider. Schneider was also a putz. Gina Gershon was a good tipper, once she realized it was going on the studios tab🤣
dumb news anchor .... duhhhhhh
Who is this woman? She’s horrible at her job
A run in with will smith?  That was like probably 30 years ago… really?z Will Smith has be nothing but the ambassador of cheerfulness for over 35 yrs.  He’s apologized to everyone gtf off his back he’s made ONE huge error and you people fcking crucify him and give him less benefit of the doubt more than the aurora co shooter
I love the back in the days stories. 💯
Will did this because Will is embarrassed by his family. And that’s the truth.
Tommy didn't want to tear that trailer up.
Man you look great!
I love u Tommy but king Richard was not will's best film ever....😏
Hate this interview person
Hey she should have asked to see his impression of Sammy Davis Jr.
That’s not acting human it’s more animalistic!
and of course everyone has to loop the slap, over and over
Wow! Chris Rock is not a saint! Not to mention, Will Smith And Chris Rock were friends! He was aware of Jada Smiths condition, not to mention that Will Smith asked him once before to lay off of his wife! Comedian or not, you don’t make fun of anyones pain! Let alone a health condition. Everyone is feeling sorry for Chris and giving him a pass, but if he was making fun of Miley Cyrus, Julia Roberts, or any other one of those top non black celebrities, Chris Rock would have been the one in trouble. They would if said how insensitive Chris Rock was for joking about such a talented woman with an illness. A slap from one of their husbands would have been warranted, and Chris would have been said to have crossed the line. Since this was Will Smith,  and Jada Pickett however, it’s a different story. Smh this was hurtful and sad all the way around. A man cannot protect his home or wife in this country unless you’re the right color.
Will Smith is trash🗑🗑🚮 #Cancel
They were going outside to the backseat of a Jeep On the LL Cool J side of the game
She's such a lame interviewer.
Honestly I lost all respect for will Smith
Once again who cares
This lady messy asl. 😂😂😂
Tommy please not another excuse for wills action
Equinsu ocha
Rosanna Scotto doesn't know who Tony Rock is but at least she makes repeated fart noises as a substitute for laughing.  What a great interviewer!
Proverbs 3/31.
I adore Tommy Davidson so much after seeing this interview.   Class act❤
Leave this man alone enough is enough my God .what is wrong with us. He did not kill any body . We all need Jesus .
By looking at the way Chris Rock was standing, like he was prepared for the slap,  by leaning in to the left and the way Will Smith seem to barely affect Chris Rock with a slap, Tells me it was all rehearsed after all they are actors, the oscars need ratings and this was the set up making it happen.
Team Will!! Hopefully Chris learned his lesson!!!
That's hogwash Chris didn't trigger anything in his balloon head because when Chris said the joke will start it laughing and when Jada gave him the evil eye that's when will when I've been smacked Chris
I love the way Tommy answered the questions. He is staying out of the sensationalism. To the thing asking the questions trying to find a way to instigate the situation even further, there is a special place hell for he/her/she/shim/it. You’re interviewing Tommy Davis Junior but you don’t know who Tony Rock is. Key word being that his last name is Rock. It’s a nobody trying to find a place riding off of someone else’s coat tail. Big ups to Tommy Davis Dow turning down the drama! I’m proud of him for this.
Tommy!Legend!I haven’t seen Tommy since we were at Disneyland together.He looks good!
The bullying of smaller men seems to be a Smith thing. Cowardly.
Man this Old Broad needs to do her homework! Looking all lost asking simple questions she should know by now!
Anyone besides me catch that eye roll at 3:39? LOL
So let me get this straight. Will's a bully because Tommy kissed his wife without her knowing anything about it being a scene in the movie beforehand and he confronted him about it 🤔
Unfortunately Rose Smith was still in character from the movie he should have gotten proper counsel after his performance to bring him back to reality
Now we know... The Academy banned Will from attending any of its events for 10 years.
It's sad when a journalist doesn't know the name of a famous comedian like Tony rock. This is cultural clash at its best. Good job fox.
Will Smith likes picking on people smaller than him.
I actually thought that it was sort of a planned little skit that no one else knew about. Too bad that wasn’t the case. I know that Will was wrong to do that..it was shocking. I’d still like to know what happened to some of those pedophiles a few years back. I hope they aren’t back in business.  They are evil
Jada is toxic
For some reason, everyone is blaming Jada for what Will did when Will has always been problematic.  Tommy had a run-in with Will Smith years ago.  Will is a bully and always has been and for anyone that is feeling sorry for him don't.
Philly guys not to fuck with
White folks trying to do the okie doke. Making this a Team Will vs Team Chris.
Damn bihh do u even watch black comedy ...she apparently doesn't know sh!t about sh!t
I think the Oscars hold accountability too.. they should screen these scripts and jokes, because he probably truly didn't know about Jada alopecia and they would of probably stayed away from that topic,  and the whole night was kind of disrespectful towards Jada it doesn't matter how the public views her she is still his wife.. asking can the single men stand up and call out Will Smith while his wife is sitting there.. it was a bit much when I deeply though about it
https://youtu.be/X_Da21Jpguk  Here is how classy the the Oscar Academy is, I guess it was Jada’s fault that John Wayne had to be held back by security, who was he going to attack exactly this young woman?  Where was his 10 year ban … #%$&@ the Oscars, anyone with half a brain knows that this was a set-up, Chris was a plant to get revenge on Jada and Will for Boycotting “Oscar’s-so-white” a few years back  ITS OBVIOUS, WE ALL KNOW IT, WE ALL SEE IT  And here’s a clue of how confused and insane humans are … we have transwomen fracturing the skulls of real women in MMA, and stealing the NCAA swim meets from real women  We might as well have men and women compete together,because that is exactly what’s happening  Where’s the rush to judgment here, where is the sanctions for the safety of participants here   $&@#%!!!!
One of the most down to earth celebs ever.
Smh trash
Real humans go to jail for hitting someone.
Love him!
Smith is not a cool dude. He thinks he's way more intelligent than he is. As for his acting...He drives everyone nuts on the set because it takes dozens of takes to get a decent sceen out of him.
Tommy🏆 kept it PC, yeah he told Will "let's go outside to just *Iron it Out*, lol. Will Smith has been acting like an insecure lil Bitch over Jada for years it seems🤔
Ppl fear the Rock family 🤣
Didn’t even know Tommy was still alive
This is all CRAP!!
Thank you Tommy William should've slapped a guy his own size that make sense.
Dude I’ve never even heard of you are you trying to get famous or something
Will Will Smith get to star in the movie they make about this? I mean come on, at least hire an actor to play him, someone like Chris Rock.
Chris talks about being bullied growing up and like tommy said Chris is a good guy with class
THE SMACK IS FAKE!!!! SHAMING RITUAL IN ORDER TO GET HIS AWARD.. BUNCH OF DISTRACTION PURPOSELY DONE AND SET-UP!THEY GIVE YOU A STILL SHOT FROM THE ONE ANGLE.. WHERE IS THAT VIDEO.. YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE CHRIS STEP FORWARD WITH HIS HEAD IN POSITION, HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK, AND WILL ACT... NOT EVEN HOW A SMACK SOUNDS ALL STAGED THEATRICS.. WILL CAN CRY JUST LIKE THAT! THAT'S HOW GOOD HE IS... THEY ARE BOTH ACTORS
Tommy a whole G!
Did You Miss Me"
Strictly Business Movie In Living Color"
If you read about Tommy Davidson's life it's both heartbreaking and beautiful. It will ALWAYS bring a tear to my eyes.*
Chris Rock is a class act, Will Smith not so much.
How tf she does not know tony ROCK is Chris brother.🤦🏾‍♀️
This dude corny as hell seen him live
To hell with Will Smith. Tommy Davidson looks good, good to see him like that.
African-Americans are turning on each other? They have been slaughtering each other for decades now. This is not news. Look at big city stats. Chicago, NYC, L.A. etc. It's genocide by their own hands. Oh, and 30,000 die each day via abortion.
When it comes down to Will Smith don't like other people talking about his wife when his wife's been with all these other people well you can't have it both ways buddy
"Chris and I go back..." not " me and Chris", agh, American English is super down grade!
Yeah documentary on Sammy Davis, Jr. This is my vote on Tommy Davison to play Sammy Davis..... OH yeah
"(ironed it out) in a street sort of way?" I love that bitch.
I saw that coming....I'm a TAE KWON DO 3RD DAN, I would have timed it just just right and sweep WILL right on his ass !!  1=self defense  2- there's no room for that kind of behavior. PERIOD !
Chris wasn’t the first person Will slapped. It’s coming back on Will. He was lucky it wasn’t Shannon Sharpe
This lady sucks at interviewing. smh
Don't let TOMMY DAVIDSON BULLSHIT YOU about him telling WILL SMITH to COME OUT SIDE!!!!! TOMMY DAVIDSON grow up WHOOPING MF ASSES!!!!😂😂
The headline should be that Jada was in a movie.
she did her homework.. hahaha
Physically he wouldn't hurt a flee.
Tommy is a legend. Grew up on him
Tony Rock annoys me in person on tv not my kind of guy
He really talks like this this guy is so smart omg 🦋❣️💓💗💗💗❤️
Tony Rock killed it!
That's the last sound effect you want to hear several times from a woman....
I AM SO SICK OF THIS SHIT! OMG SERIOUSLY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
NYC news is 🔥
Jada Played The Oscar's like a fiddle
I love Tommy met him yrs ago! Sweetie! I haven’t seen him live in yrs.
I don't care how Will Smiths common sense was at an all time low... You Do not punch another person !!!!! If i get mad at my husband and wollop him across the mouth, I'm getting arrested. They wouldn't say Ok, Now here's your Oscar..... He is a Dumb nit Wit.
Tommy’s one of the funniest people ever
Why this lady farting?
Good thing little Tommy didn't step off the bus. 😁😁
It must be very difficult for Will that Jaden looks so much like Tupac...
Will think he ALI.... or Tupac!! Foo ain’t NEITHER!!  I’ll go 18 with da punk!! And I’m old enuff to be dat punk’s gramps!!
Umm, does someone need some extra strength Gas X?
Wasn’t no smack heard around the world. I didn’t hear it. Chris was still standing. Love tap.
News reporter "Come on Tommy we want you to tear Will Smith down..give us some dirt pretty please!"
Will Smith is a hypocrite. If he's not careful he's going to find himself being ostracized like Bill Cosby.  Not not for the same crimes but for being deceitful and self absorbed. Something I think many in the Industry know already.
you still talking about this smh lol the highlight of your life move on
Tommy still do comedy?
Scared ? Really ? So scared he slaps him ?
We love you Tommy. Strictly Business is one of the greatest films ever.
A Soft Joke Hollywood Strikes Back Return the Comedian This trilogy is going to be better than Disney Star Wars Trilogy.
Real human?? Wow the left are gonna love that one! 🤦‍♂️
Tommy is a class act. Always have been. From ILC til present day. Dude gets nothing but respect from me
The real question is why would Tommy even bring up that story it almost seems like he's clout chasing that happened years ago cuz I know the movie that he's talking about that was a long long time ago you never told that story before why tell it now you clout chasing boss that wasn't a story even worth telling
He was going to wash eem.
totally agree
“When emotions are high common sense is at an all time low”
I'm excited to see Tommy Davidson live for the first time this coming September at Yoshi's Northern CA! 🙂😂😃🤣
The west Philly came out of wil that’s all we lived in the same block as kids
Tommy spitting facts
I LOVE Tommy, but he is being VERY diplomatic. In any event I would love to see his stand up.
Typical of a Fox to dig into something and try to make it ugly.
That eye roll at @3:40 😂😂😂😂 this guy is hilarious !!
is she drunk?
Wise nice guy
So now everyone has had a problem with big ol bad Will Smith... SMH... Let these brothers heal please... stop giving these mzungus ammo...
Tommy was prepared to thump and to let hands fly😆😆😆
People need to understand  some people can't take a joke sometimes its really hurtful.... Wow so sad
Ok...Will Smith gained 30 lbs. of "muscle" in order to do the Muhammad Ali movie according to comedian Paul Rodriguez who was in the same movie as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco. He gained that weight, we all know, by taking PED'S and if you listen to Paul and others they'll tell you that Smith's behavior was "roid" ragical.  At the Oscar's,  his emotions we're off the chart.  Steroids....
It was a bully assault. Hard to watch. His Oscar should be revoked. At a deep level Smith was obviously not ok; doesn’t make what he did excusable. Look at all the people in jail; hurt people hurt.
tommy your the only one that hit it correctly he is human not one person who came for him said that.. chris is human too no one no one can take back what has happen. we all do things we regret!!!! yes apologies need to go all around..
Safe to say she dont know who the hell tony rock is lol
Will Smith 'smacked' he assaulted Chris Rock
Tommy use to be awesome!! Chris Rock should be ashamed of himself for making jokes about Jada’s medical issues, for all we know Jada could be battling cancer. Whoever wrote the joke should be held accountable. I definitely don’t condone violence, but, Chris Rock has been harassing Jada for years. Chris should of known that this was coming
Will smith needs to get off those steroids look at him steroids build your body but they also affect your behavior they make you more aggressive look at his body when he played Ali😎
Everybody talking about Will Smith it look bad come on black ppl you keep going to the media Chris Rock is not that sweet he didn't deserve the slap come on y'all black ppl you helping making black ppl look bad also I'm disappointed in all of y'all. White ppl love this they can talk to y'all and you agree how they feel about Will they really don't t give a damn about Chris Rock you just help their talking points about black ppl. Will Smith he is human thank God our Lord have Grace on him I do also.( Written by Lisa)
I don't think Will Smith was scared, I do believe that Will Smith has a horrible and terrible way of managing the relationships in his life particularly the one with his wife he's great at his craft but relationships he needs counseling
"Tony Rock is his brother???" (Hahaha)
If you that jealous  and you know your wife acts and will kisses women in movies seems like will has a double standard  to me and jada  got tried  of that and had some fun of her own
Wow! I find this kind of funny. After Will and Chris's incident, people are coming from everywhere talking about what Will either did or said to them. I highly doubt "hollywood entertainers" are afraid of him to where they have kept silent for this long. This is bullshit!
It's funny they call Will a Bully. Going to school even on the street the Bully pick at the Weak or someone know they wont fight them back unit the Weak show they was preventing a fight even if they could or couldn't beat the Bully. There lots of things to joke about. Find it. People not taking much punching and walking away. It's a old saying don't start something won't be nothing. Ok now I gave real talk come have some fun with MTR. The Ultimate Diecast Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency Raceway. 🙂
Where do they find these phony, corny fox news people?
Not the Schlit’s Malt Liquor tour!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
How could she not know who Tony Rock is????
She never did her research.tsk tsk
Will Smith is Cringe 😫
Now everyone has a story
Human? No Will was like an f'ing animal attacking a more than easy prey that already was calm & had his hands behind his back. "Jada, I love ya', Gi Jane 2, can't wait to see it okay?" needs defending? It's a standard traditional type of indirect non-threatening joke. All comedians do it for years. It would have been over if she walked on stage 1/3 of the way instead of her spoiled pretentious "husband" because Chris would have apologized from behind the curtain.
Tommy, Tony Rock is as known as his brother, he’s just not as rich monetarily! Please don’t say that again!
Chris Rock is Not Innocent. I hope you don't think everybody's completely stupid about the history of Hollywood and how you all got where you got okay because Eddie Griffin talked about the behavior of Hollywood Katt Williams talked about things that going in Hollywood I don't know why all the sudden you want to sit up here and pay Chris as innocent Chris is no more innocent than the rest of y'all and yes he has said things that were very disrespectful to black women despite his movie on making money off of the exploitation of our hair and even in that movie they were comments that he made that work extremely offensive to black women.
Fake liars and opportunistic  , now have something to say about  a slap probably deserved!!!!
Lets all face reality Will Smith needs therapy
She a putz
Gotta love Tommy Davidson!  😻
Everyone coming down on Will, people act like he just going around beating people up regularly!.. It was 1 slap that happened weeks ago and people will not let it go!... This show that it doesn't matter how long you been positive if you do 1 thing as a black man your 30year career Will be over!...
Whole interview " I don't know " well if you don't know then shut up
We know this and Tommy know why he did it. Men don't play or joke about another men women. That's basic men code.
Should play Urkle in a movie.  -Definitely has the look down
This reporter is phony 🤣
Why do even local white employees on the Fascist news Network, always try to propagandize racist stereotypes? Tommy is No punk and saw right through it!🤣
People are making excuses for that egotistical jack ass.  He needs a swift and severe consequence to remind him that he can't assault another human being. Everyone is tiptoeing around him afraid to condemn him for obviously hurting Chris Rock. I say let him run up on the wrong person. Now he's in repair my image mode .. doing the usual thing faking the rehab funk , crying  sending out fake ass apologies. Give those roles to other actors ..it's time to let Will Smith and his sick family go on home
Tommy's fake fighting styles are levels above the Prince.
that "iron it out" response was 🤌🏾 bc it could mean lay his ass out flat dunno if y'all caught that. he knows alluding to fighting Will will distract from what he waves the focus to be on for his PR ....dooope
Calling Chris a sweet loving guy is a backwards compliment. Don't no guy want to be called that after being b*tch slapped. Yes Chris may have been small and not able to defend himself against the bigger Will Smith, but don't call him that afterwards.
Chris Rock shouldn't have never said that silly ass joke. It just goes to show you that Chris Rock have anger issues about a woman he know but yet he wanted to embarrass her like he was roasting her at a Def Jam Comedy. Where was Chris Rock mine  This not just about a smack, This goes back sinc 2016 or even further which Jada couldn't name couldn't stay out of his mouth.  A grown as man wouldn't have a woman in his mouth for all those years then bring it to the oscars to EMBARRASS her. That was both big night Wil Smith and Jada.  People nd to stop being so damm sensitive about that smack and figure out what lead up to this in te first place.  Rock had something on his mine plain and simple and it backfired on him which he embarrassed himself.
Goin way back when Robert Townsend show was the sh#t
Chris would hurt someone's feelings though! Chris ain't innocent. it is what it is. Why would a lil dude make fun of a bigger dude if that's a thing. lil dudes can handle bigger dudes too. Chris the same measure dealt out to him. He clowned  Will's ppl on stage and got crowned on stage in return.
Pay attention to the host
So the news anchor was asking Tommy to say he wanted to fight will smith........really GOOD DAY NY  WOW
Roseanne Scotto....still looking good after all these years.
Will was sitting there Laughing his ass off at the joke Chris said about G I JANE… It wasn’t until Will looked At Jada and Will saw she wasn’t happy.. I always watched Fresh Prince  when I-was younger younger but I never saw a movie he was in.. Just from seeing short clips with him it I changed my view on Will…I can’t stand looking at him and now this pussie ass slap he did GRRR..Will needs a Good Slap to bring him off his “HIGH HORSE”..!!!!!… jmo
Thank you Tommy, that's the best response anyone has ever made about this whole Will and Chris situation. People forget that we are all human no matter what our status is.💖 and thanks for not feeding into that host messiness.
Awesome comedian with a great voice to boot.
😳 oh so that's where Rock got the idea ro set Will up. No wonder that whole scene seems off.
I think Will Smith's face says it all after the act turning around walking away along with what he screamed (and the way he screamed) sitting down afterwards. That's him.
schlitz malt liquor tour! lmao. well god damn
In Living Color!
Here we go certain  peolpe starting shit.they cant stop stirring the pot and we always follow. like we always do.
Lmfao
"Naw I mean iron in out like in laundry" lol nice reversal
I miss this guy! Finally, a Tommy Davidson sighting. Please, come back.
If Jada was so sensitive about her alopecia she could, like probably 2/3 of the oscar attendees, wear faux hair
Clickbait
When emotions is high, duck!
Is this woman a clone of Jeanine Pirro?
We all were taught to keep your hands to yourself and your feet on the floor.... RESPECTFULLY! 🙄
The movie is putuy tang that you played jada love boyfriend classic movie
Is trey moe your son
The story with Will Smith is Willard Smith II is absolutely human.
The lady has a farting laugh.
This lady interviewing bugs the crap out of me.
Will treats his wife like she is property
“WOO” the name of the movie Tommy Davidson played in with Jada Pinkette
Two dudes two gold light weapons and just evil gang Up type shit😅
👁👁💬heeeees.....  Lord sidious Janglers 🤷🏿‍♂️💬him and Jim are Gang home boys 👀🤙
👀💬Alright hes..... lord sidious Jangler
I noticed that Will was bigger and beefier than Chris Rock.  Typical of a bully to pick on a smaller target.
But did Will slap August Alsina or any of the other men Jada frequently invites to spend time between her legs?  The Academy already did their thing - they gave him a standing ovation.  They couldn't put him out.  They politely suggested that he could leave if he felt like it and he said something to the effect of No, I own this place. The Security and pussy LAPD let him sty and enjoy the show.  His punishment was to be allowed to give an acceptance speech describing himself as a hero.  Waddaya expect from Hollywood????????
WTF?? Will was scared?? So it’s ok to go through the effort of hopping up on stage and hitting someone? Because one is scared? 😂 truly laughable
Like other celebrities haven't acted badly or used poor judgment.  Will was wrong but there are much more important issues to be concerned about. Like the open border, inflation, etc.
if it was shaq or the rock WS wouldnt have done shit
It still takes my breath away to see Will Smith do that uncalled for s#$t he did by slapping that classy Chris Rock.
Fox is messy!
So Will did what he was supposed to do… lmao.Tommy and the writers rewrote the script including a sexual scene WITHOUT telling Jada, and y’all thought both Jada and Will wouldn’t be mad?  That’s not bully behavior.  This is getting weird. All these stories coming out with only 1/2 the truth.   All these comedians (whom I once respected and gave grace) trynna capitalize of Will’s misstep.  If I was Will I would do a documentary detailing the dark lives of comedians and all the bad things they’ve done.  Since they want to act perfect.
One of my favorite comics Tommy
Aint watching the F...IN movie.
Good observation.  Not justified behavior, but good observation.
The interview let us HOT!!!
Actually I wouldn't mind seeing Jada in that role GI JANE 😂😂 , it could be her best work ever IJS 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Assuming.
I love Tommy..lol
Will Smith makes me sick. How did he lose his mind over a joke? What is wrong with him????  Hope he goes into hiding. That award represents his worst night EVER??
Wouldn't hurt A flea ? why not say a fly it would've rhymed with Guy...just saying
Chris should sue Will and donate the proceeds to a charity about violence. If Chris doesn't do anything then every comedian is going to have to worry about somebody coming up on the stage and slap them.
Acting like will is not family.  America just stop it   We love will. We are just emotional now. We'll get over it.
He got scared and became real human, really?????? OK.
💪💪💪
Wow didn’t know Tommy Davidson was a Republican
Tommy handled this well because this interview was messy af she seriously tried to make it about Will. Tommy is a comedic genius glad he didn't take the bait
this is Ironic, cuz the last time I was face to face with tommy he was cracking on me cuz I was with a pretty date so he was giving me a hard time.. But H had this really big swollen black eye and I kept thinking, I cans see your willing to go way to far with what U got to say but I stayed silent cuz I was do to get up & dance with J-Lo & The Fly girls any moment so......
White folks are physically scared of Will
So Jada let him slap Chris but wouldn't let him go out side one on one with Tommy?
He didn’t tell the whole story because tommy was wrong lmao he said the story before that he kissed Jada in the movie without he consent but clearly didn’t mention it here to make will look like the bad guy and to get his 5 sec of fame lamo
this interview lady may possibly be the daughter of satan. sheesh
Beta Simps battles
Met Will Smith once, super nice
Jealous person. He is violent. Probly not even her fault for what he did
Will didnt forget where he was he knew and now he got away with it.  Whoopi goldberg iis on the committee and that's why
Tommy  funny as hell omg lol and he telling the truth 🤣😂😆😭😅👏🤣😂😆😭😅👏
Greatttt… let all the has beens come outta the woodwork to comment on this farce…
She horrible 😢let it go damn
Any body except Chris, like Katt Williams.  Will Smith would have been handled with an ass kicking!
Karma knocked on Will’s door.  Janet Huber’s career was destroyed by Will.
So give me the realationship between Tony Rock and Chris Rock?..... SMH
So I guess the actress who played aunt Vib was telling the truth about Will Smith.
Props to Rosanna Scotto she is an OG in the broadcast business and still doing it!
The first Aunt Viv was right about Will after all
It's a sham when our BC have to use us as their Jokes but their Jew & white friends they are very silent & if Y have to use the same person for Your joke on the day they are being given a Award speaks volume on that Person & I thought that what CR said is out of line & if He did that to a Jewish Men in the industry Chris Rock would not have a Job because most of our people are taught to fight each other but be little boys & girls with all other Nations Please CCC Stop using people's lives for Your Jokes stop it
I hate when they interrupt in the middle of the story. They never go back to where they left off.
I like him .
Dude aged well
BS
Please leave Will Smith along, please
Tommy needs to get a life all of these people are jealous of him his success it is so sad it seems like all about black people are the main one trying to talk bad about him Jim Carrey needs to sit down and get a life and if I mistakenly misspelled any words it is because I am voice texting but leave will alone he is a winner and he will always be a winner keep your head up God is with you he loves you and you love you and you keep doing that it don't let nothing kill or steal your joy walk over Satan he is under your feet be strong in the Lord has gold has a lion you already repented to God who cares what men think they not your creator all of these people keep talking about that slap that's gossiping that's a sin stop it get a life now God is going to do something in this world is going to make you all stop talking about this slap everybody is focusing on the slap but not God get over the slap and focus on God the almighty the Holy One.
So when a man smacks a woman it should be considered "human"? Go take a few seats!
I'm sick of hearing about it.
Like the way he presented/ observed this tradgety.
LOVE TOMMY IN BOOTY CALL!!
But  Chris rock always talking g about blacks and women Chris Rick is a  comedian bullying
Will Smith Reaction from Streets from da REAL Underground  https://youtu.be/FlPaXkbKYNQ
Tommy was off the hook when he was on In Living Color !
that why i say.. the slap was staged .. look at it again chris stuck his head out... so will could slap him...go look...when you see someone coming toward you ...you straighten up not lean forward with your hands behind your back....FAKE
OMG she Is annoying 😖
I blame Jada for all this 😢 she's like a Jezabel
Oscar Proud
Need to change his nickname from fresh prince to B!tch of Bel air… because it’s Will Smith and Jada Pickett nothing is done I really hope Chris sues Will cause he needs a taste of reality.
Will has Relationship Stockholm Syndrome as evidenced by his irrational behavior after Jada rolled her eyes at him. He's terrified she'll cheat again so he freaked out and slapped Chris.  She's the one in an open marriage, not Will. He needs an intervention and a good divorce lawyer.
Why did he not slap August for the entanglement with Jada?
Tommy Davidson is a great comedian,I remember him back to his in living color days,hats off to you Tommy
Not a fan of insult comedy.  Inam hoping comics do less of it going forward.  Use yourself not audience members.
Be a better person there is no need to talk about.  Look at the RIGHT  TURN THE LEFT AGAINST HE OTHER
Who is this lady? Love Tommy, he is so comical and very intelligent needless to say.
Tommy Davidson is so underrsted . He was talking about the movie "Woo". 😫🤣
🤣 Great interview!!  I guess all of the other black comedians were busy.
It seem as this woman is trying to instigate more drama
Human but, a weak human. He laughed Jada rolled her eyes, Will lost his shit and Jada laughed to the point of bending over sitting in her chair, why is it sooo many people didn't watch her reaction on the replay? Chris was a complete rockstar the way he handled it.
Now this not the first person that has been slapped by William. We all remember the "Kiss" on the face that set him off. Now I have known William from the Bel Aire days. Perfect gentleman. Kind, humble, loving and a friend. A monster is not in his character. For people to find suffering funny is crazy. I am going to go to a cancer hospital where people are dying and tell jokes about them. That is heartless. Obama would back me up on that. Sir Lucifer The Great common sense. The moles knows. Obama a good mole, a mole from the ole days. Just the good ole boys never meaning no harm been in trouble with the law since the day they were born.
It's funny because maybe the run-in Tommy Davidson had with Will Smith is the reason we don't see him no more😐 the academy is looking for a reason to cancel the Smiths they not on code with Hollyweird  CR shouldn't fell for the bait he knew  he was the fall guy😜
Tommie chose his word wisely. That chick was trying to pull slime out and he knew that.
Did she really say “in a street kind of way?” @ 2:54
said absolutely NOTHING.
Willye needs to be banned for life from the Oscars.  He might actuality appreciate it anyway since that show is lame af
Damn she fishin!
Will can make out with multiple women on scripts tho 🤔
Why are these washed up folks that we don't hear of anymore got a fabulous story all of a sudden... Where was this energy then... Don't care all Hollywood sacrifice... Everybody jabbing at Will wait till its their turn....
will smith walks off stage all proud like he did something cool... totally uncool
Look at the whites always trying to here somthing black
Replaying it over and over is in poor taste.
She has an unusual laugh
Chris worked with Jada years ago in the Madagascar movie. And rumors are now surfing that they had a thing going. Not sure how accurate that is but I do think it has something to do with the Oscar's in 2016 when Jada criticized Chris for not boycotting the Oscars. I don't know what she expected since Chris had already signed a contract to host that year. Maybe that's why Chris made the joke about her because he was salty about her comments, and since then she's been salty about his comments. Instead of her asking Chris to come to the Red Table to talk about any unresolved issues they have, she chose to mess up Will important night by rolling her eyes at a 5 second joke.  And for the record, when I saw Jada rocking that look, I said, "Oh, she's rocking the GI Jane look." I never knew she had alopecia (could be from wearing weaves as well) LIKE MOST OF the World and if Mose of us didn't know then why are her fans saying Chris knew?
Why is anyone still talking about this nonsense???
Love Tommy, he seems like a nice guy and he's so funny. Loved his skits with Wanda ( Jamie Foxx) I got you 😂
Greatest response!!!  "Will became super human.... regular!
Praise for Tommy! That's a comedian right there. The dude is Fun-knee! Will Smith.... meh.
L 0
they reaching hard if they got tommy davidson in the news. comics are a true people, these journalists are reaching hard, they don't care about listening to what people have to say
This chick said what's the relation between Tony and Chris smh
So basically...Everybody hates Will.
This lady is annoying
No excuse for BAD BEHAVIOR!!
"What's the back story on this guy Tony Rock?"  "It's Chris Rock's brother, YOU IDIOT"!!!
Jada is poison
What Chris said didn't trigger anything in Smith!  That cuckold liked the joke until his master wife cracked her whip.  He hits a man for a joke, but is OK if a man actually screws his wife.
What do you mean real human? Well that doesn't look good for humans.
Most "news" people are so dull. This woman actually has a personality.
Will is a man from Philly  baby
Please stop beating a dead horse  🐎 For the million time Chris Rock initiated this mess.
Not having self control  doesn't make you any more "human" bro
"Would hurt a flea" FLY!   Wouldn't hurt a FLY.
That slap looks so fake
Jailtime
Can ppl just get over it? That was 2 weeks ago. It’s like being stuck on stupid….
That's NOT a look of fear on Will's face. That's a picture of arrogance, on the countenance of who bully, speaking volumes to anyone with eyes to see. 👀😳 I just assaulted an individual and no one dared to stop me! 🤔🙄😲
FU Will Smith
Black people are lost period  enough already y'all need to care of your own period enough of all the kid gloves with you people
( Mike Tyson voice) "More like Will Bith!"
BLM = Black Lies Matter!
Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Veteran-U.S. NAVY SEABEE!
Paul Rodriguez also had a huge problem with Will Smith.
Chris should of press charges to get him off cloud ☁️
Somebody trying to stay relevant!! 🤔
Who is this interviewer? Everything Tommy is saying is kinda going over her head. Its like when I talk to my grandma.
Talk it out woman. Not all black folks go around sneak attack slapping people.
Hope he didn't get fake slapped by will. If he did I just hope will didn't smile as much during like he did against Rock when he broke character.
Hey will what's it like to be married to a whrwife who made a mockery of you and your family your whole life?
Tommy don't fall for the okie doke.
They need to give you an Oscar for the Sugar Ray Leonard story
Oscars turned into Love N” Hip hop. Ghetto as hell.
Will has mental issues because of his wife
EV's Smacking GAINS... * SOLO Electra Meccanica Heading to Hudson Yards in NY for Drive Event in April. * IQST Up 38 % month. New EV Motorcycles.. and * XOS..Large EV Trucks Up 17 % month. Increasing deliveries of Fed Ex EV Trucks.
We all know there's  problems  in the marriage ! We know it was wrong what will did to Chis Rock . What we have to do is be God like and pray for them we all are God's  children and we all make mistakes  let it go . 🙏🙏🙏🙏
In living color
Seems to me the common denominator of Will's bad behavior is Jada. Just sayin.
Tommy wanna step outside Davidson
In a street kinda way??? Is that dog whistle like terms urban and inner city? She is annoying like judge Jeanne.
Damn, sounds like Will likes to buck up to these little dudes.
Will Did this to himself. He's always been this way. It's just coming to light now .
Tommy is a Veteran comic from way back before politically correct
All of the haters are coming out of the wood work against Will, like termites running from a burning log...🙄😒
Will Smith is real Weak Minded. Period.
Words hurt also
Chris almost hit him back you can see he kinda drew back after Will hit him, but he caught himself and Im glad he did fighting would have been horrible.
Different interviewer please
God! they digging everyone out the wood work- like really???
Will Smith is finished.
He’s great
Who has heard what Paul Rodriguez says about Will?
Creamed Corn....NOOOOOOOOO!
Will is a 🤡
Regardless of the size difference, I am sure had Will Smith made the mistake of slapping Tommy Davidson ... Mr. Tommy would have had Willie cursing the day he was born!  Willie, you best get yourself some counseling before somebody hurts you!
This is not the first time Will has hit someone....he beat a producer when he was 20, smacking the guy in Ukraine when he kissed will on the cheek, its not the first time he has used anger !!
These videos are starting to sound more like the devaluation stages of NARC ABUSE. Interesting, but Will and Jada are narcissistic? You first idolised him, and now he is the Devil, interesting?🧐🤔
WILL SMITH DID NOT BECOME HUMAN, HE BECAME THE COWARDLY CRUEL THUG HE IS.
I do NOT care how well he does his JOB if he cannot handle being CIVIL to friends or coworkers or stand up for himself with his wife or treat his children with kindness.  I and thousands watched him bully his son on the Degeneris show and she helped humiliate that kid.  Will Smith had hands on that kid it was awful.
Hopefully Will`s career is over.
How many people want Will Smith to slap "Candace Owens" "LOL".
Tommy doesn't know! He can't woop Will Smith.
Ah, you just told on yourself, you snuck a kiss on Jada and its wasn't authorized.You threw the rock now you hiding your hand... Undercover sexual assault.
The world streets ghetto are very angry with Will Smith. Watch out Will. Protect your dumb ass. Streets are very angry with you. Police will not protect you ever.
For anyone whose been reading Will's book... Will has spent HIS ENTIRE LIFE stuffing his emotions/feelings down, in order to become "a machine" aimed at succeeding and success. His true feelings are often suppressed by laughter... a protection from others, and from himself. I argue, he still hasn't learnt how to navigate this aspect of himself... mainly due to deep-seated trauma. Not to make excuses for him, at all, but for as successful as he has been in the world; for as many self-help, or as much Alchemical/Transformational work he has done, (rather successfully I may say), the man still has yet to dig deep within himself and unearth that part of himself that really is HIM  I feel, despite an entire book on his life, despite the many transformations he has unearthed about himself and his own character... he has still yet to hit the surface of himself, His True Self, and that when he does... we will all get a much better Actor, Entertainer, Person out of it all. And he will also be much happier, fulfilled (that's the real important part).  As for now, the public can judge him all they want. But I don't think we've seen The Real Will yet. And when we do, I think we're all really going to like that guy. It's not easy for anyone to transcend that kind of trauma, so kudos to anyone has actually done it.
Dam she putting the heat on him
4/5/22....DON'T know this guy Tommy Davidson but he seems pleasant + well spoken + intelligent + mild mannered... BUT goes far back with Chris Rock. Kind of reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr for real!
This lady reminds me of Judge Jenean  on Fox news
Is that the guy from booty call from way back with Jamie fox lol....where he had wrapped himself in plastic clung wrap to where he couldn't breathe?  Lol
So underrated since ILC days ive never noticed but tommy has a similar resemblance to 80's singer Jermaine Stewart!
So many people are coming out talking about they had a run end with Will Smith but they didn't bring it up until now, that's how you know they're not telling the truth because if they had to run end with Will Smith they would talk about it when it happened 😐
Tommy had issues with Jamie Fox. What's wrong with Tommy! Chris is hated by black women. He has degraded black women in the past! Glad he got slapped!
A bully? Do ya think?????? Maybe someone can help him.  Chris Rock should be paid .☮️
Tony Rock is awesome. So is Tommy and Chris
CHRIS ROCK DID NOT TRIGGER WILL BECAUSE HE STARTED TO LAUGHT AT THE JOKE. JADA DID SOMETHING TO THE WHIMP..HE STARTED TO ACT THE "FOOL". NEVER WILL SMITH AGAIN. IT'S OVER.
Tommy would have gave him that work
She said "oh Tony Rock..." Smart opposite.
TIRED OF Listening ABOUT WILL JADA
It's not that serious
Seen Tommy Davidson at The Improv in Tampa about 10-12 years ago... Always been one of the funniest dudes I've ever seen live. Big Up Tommy!! From the In Living Color days ✊🏼
Tommy is a great interview guest.
I love Tommy
Yeah the incident between him & Will is from the movie Woo and that's an old one. But Timmy Davidson is still hilarious and looks great. 💙💙💙💙
So will have his way with all comedians but not with Jada
Now Will Smith is a bully please stop the madness comics need to take accountability for the joke's they tell because comics do go way to far for a laugh all they say is people need to be thick skinned b.s no your limits because you don't know what someone is going through in their lives
Tommy my boy....still remember he and Joe Torry in Memphis and almost getting my ass whooped by my old lady
Will Smith is a giga simp plain and simple.  Everybody knows it.  I think his mind broke when he found out about the latest "entanglement"  He's now trying to be something he is not
It was staged 💯
This dude had me crying 😭😂 laughing back in the day on In Living Color
Everybody stop showing the footage. Chris the winner. Real stand up guy.
Bumblebee tuna! Wachati in the house!
Tommy you are sounding Diplomatic. 🙂But you Pic and choose your Battles. We are  told from God's word keep your senses because our adversary the Devil walks about like a roaring lion seeking to devour someone. When you are stuck on SELF then you blame it on No body else. A Lesson for all of us. 😐
Oh boy, here’s the “me too” crowd coming
Tommy's special Illin' in Philly back in late 80s early 90s wasy very first introduction to stand up. I was 11-12, and I watched it about 200 times. He is an underrated genius.
Lol drama kings and queens
I love you Tommy his sister was my counselor at the rec in silver spring!!!!! MD ❤️❤️❤️❤️
WAY BACK TOMMY WOW...
"The Varnell Hill Show .. Sha Boing Boing!!!"
*Will* it be a trend?  Tommy Davidson and comedians onstage everywhere are subject to what could become a precedent. Dont let Bon Qui Qui call "Sa-Kur-I-Tee"
Tommy you beauty.
It wasn't fear it wasn't overwhelming emotion. He strutted up there with confidence and he strutted away with confidence. See what people don't realize is every time something gets screwed up on a bad level it's always somebody from the black community. Ben Shapiro summed it up best when he said has nothing to do with color but everything to do with culture. But he wasn't talking about this particular incident it was about a different subject. But I get the gist of what he was saying. The black community glamorizes stuff like this. And it's a bad representation of the black community because 90% of them are very good people. In the other 10% are a bunch of thugs and want to be thugs that try to look like badasses on TV. He knew exactly what he was doing. And he is not remorseful at all he's just been damaged control right now. Denzel I'm equally disappointed in you. Everybody looks up to you Denzel and Morgan Freeman to represent the black community in a positive way. But Denzel you just gave him a pass and came up with some b******* excuse. Everybody has stress. Everybody has dirty laundry and issues. Wrong place and time to air out your laundry. Denzel tells you that at your highest moment that's when the devil comes for you and you still did what you did. Your ghetto piece of s*** Will Smith. And even if he told you that after the fact about the devil coming for you in your highest moment, you still didn't apologize to Chris Rock. You apologize to everybody except Chris Rock. Maybe we should have the black academy awards and a white academy awards. And I don't mean to say that in a racist way because you already have Black entertainment awards. So you know what just add another one. Kanye West acting out on TV. Nicki Minaj calling out Miley Cyrus on a award show and now Will Smith on this award. Different incidences different awards but they're not conducting themselves in a proper manner. Even the gangsters in the 50s and 60s that's Sinatra and the rat pack used to hang out with. Everybody held themselves like civilized human beings. And they were Mafia killers. But yet they held themselves in a very glamorous way. My point is you can be a piece of s*** and still conduct yourself in a respectful manner. That's where the phrase or the saying comes in quote. There's a time and place for everything and this is not the time or the place. And will you're no gangster. Piece of s*** but no gangster. Your girls got you by the balls. Why she has everybody else's balls in her mouth. You need to get your priorities straight.
"When people show you who they are.....Believe Them!" - Maya Angelou  Take heed to these words of wisdom.
Megan M took lessons from you all.  Hey, I am in the limelight that good.
He is still a bully 🙄
What's up with Will Smith?  He's a bully.  He's full of himself.  He HAD an impressive body of work.  Now, The Slap is all he will be remembered by.  Chris, Be Blessed Brother; I love you.
Who gives the right to comedians to be "bullies" and  make fun of others?  They always said that they laugh with everybody,  but the truth is that they laugh at everybody.  Finally somebody put comedians in their place. WELL DONE, MR SMITH.
Who's the Broad? She ain't too bad looking...
This interviewer is not authentic. I love you Tommy Davidson
I have searched high and low for Tommy’s Illin in Philly and can’t find it anywhere. One of my favorite stand-ups ever. Somebody help!!!
No, no, no he didn’t become real human; BEHAVIOR under pressure is what sets HUMANS apart from beasts!
If Chris Rock is not lynching Will Smith, I'm definitely not. One public mistake and he loses everything. Alec Baldwin is the worst of the worst, but he's still walking around after everything we have seen him do that would make a Black Actor's career be over. So nope, not participating in the Lynching a Black Man committee!
Smith Fam is just sick pleez seek some deep rooted HELP
This year's Academy Awards signals that it's time to end "Black on Black Crime" in the United States🙏🙏🙏🙏
The cult is coming for will
Still laughing about the Schlitz Malt Liquor Tour.   HAHAHAHA!  That was great.
Tommy Davidson is a great human being.
I LOVE Tommy Davidson!!!
That was triggered response for sure and lately he’s been talking his childhood trauma. I hope he could finally deal with watching his dad abuse is mom. Childhood trauma is real!
this woman knows 0 blk culture. "Let's make her the interviewer"- FOX
This woman trying to be nosey an dont even know that tony rock is chris rocks bro 😆
well will smith says he always felt like a coward in the beginning of his book..you know how the saying goes when someone tells you what they are believe them...we all know if it was dwayne rock johnson instead of chris rock will wouldnt have done that but since chris is 4 inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter the coward became brave.
Good 1 Tommy!
This is how removed FOX network folks are about regular, normal "cultural" people in society. She has to ask who Tony Rock is? Heffa, do your homework!
No Tommy Jada’s face triggered Will cuz he was first laughing at the “joke” …🙄
Chris sooooo innocent yeah right but yet he been picking with the smith family for years kiss ass celebrities prime example
Man stop making excuses for that clown there is no excuse for what he did.
Tommy is funny
Tommy isn't the only comedian who's been bullied by that entitled jerk. Jaime Foxx came out with an incident at Nelson Mandela's house years back. Jaime was exchanging jokes with Mandela, and both men were having fun and not religious it to heart. Mandela made a joke to Jaime saying he looks like Mike Tyson, ti Jaime replied, well tut look like uncle Ben.  Well according to Jaime, Will grabbed him by the throat and yelled at him for speaking to Mandela for that joke. And Will Smith was arrested in Philly years back in the 90's fir Assault. And he also slapped a reporter on the red carrier as well. So he has a history of violence and losing his cool with an entitled attitude that he will always get away with it, because he had for sure long.  Will Smith is a thug and a bully.
What Chris said didnt trigger it cause will laugh about it
Man I miss Tommy he used to have me crying laughing on in living color
Who Tommy Davidson  ? 😋
I'm tired of excuses being made for the violence, he's human blah blah blah. You can bet if it had been a while person he would have been cremated by everyone!!
I have a question. Why is it ok for chris Rock to talk about wills children  and wife? CRock always  have his family  in jokes.
This news lady sucks
Tommy!!!! You look great man!!!! Miss you!!!!
She really tried to bait him. I’m glad he didn’t fall for it!
Take back the Oscar, set a good example to the world violence isn't okay inside the academy.
Becoming human maybe Will’s best performance.
Very well Respected I love Tommy
will smith is a actor, not very important,  move on! will and jada very bad parents
"I remember that"  NO you don't 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 , it wasn't real💀
Prime example of how the media loves negative drama, and tries to drag shxt on instead of letting it go. #MoveOnAlready
The next thing the academy will do is kiss Will,s ass.
https://youtu.be/il1sgQUtYs8
That is a great saying " When emotions are high common sense is low ". So true.
She needs to stop making that pffffrt sound, so crass, yuck!
I don't like this announcer, she is soo 70s and brassy, and talks too much with her hands. Oh, I left out she is no blonde! Sigh.
She didn’t know Tony Rock 🙄
The Schlitz Malt Liquor Tour... 😂🤣😂🤣😭
It ain't ever "over", when it comes comedic material.
Tommy handled those questions about Will and this interview like a professional so I really admire him for the way that he chose to communicate.  Also this IS a pattern of violence with Will Smith.  The "nice guy" image is just that, an image and not reality of the quickly angry, aggressive man that has also been displayed by him.
I like Tommy, he is underrated as a comedian. Seen him at the Fox Theater he was hilarious.
Oscar Proud had a run in
Black people I am against what Will Smith have done yes but don't throw him under the bus and beat him down don't do that, that's what they want you to do and y'all are all doing it You are all stupid if you don't see that it's biggest day If hes not on that right path help him guide him We love and respect them both
Well, in this case you all can have EXACTLY what you all asked for. Thanks to Will Smith  I suppose it’s OSCAR SO RED. Don’t blame white America for this nonsense. BTW, crazy will make you do crazy things, not love.
So sad this happened in front of the world two "BLACK MEN" that are awesome actors, Comedians that acted like this. This goes to show their is a time that some joking is  Offensive. This will go down in  History black comedian slaps another black comedian actor the  the oscars don't really want Some races to win big anyway . Just to think this is sad human but   sad. No disrespect to other races but this is true. My black people ya'll need to keep it together with love and  Unity.  Keep God first
I feel it is odd that people use " comedy " has a reason to say distasteful things at the expense of others.  When did that become the definition of comedy.  Or being a comedian.
I notice a trend.  People cross a line with his wife and expects this man to just turn the other cheek. I guess when your a black woman it is never okay to be protected or defended. Every one else is human and have feelings accept for us.
Will should have smack Tommy with the left for being so 🌽
That woman is just annoying to listen to but loved hearing Tommy's take on his experience with Will and the slap.
"When one doesn't heal from their issues, one lives by the dictates of their issues." (Tanya O'Quinn) Seems very appropriate in this instance...  #Heal #InnerChildDamage #MisplacedAnger #Childhoodtrauma
That is not being a bully that's a man being jealous of his girlfriend. I don't know why he used that word Will is a bully🤦🏿‍♀️
It wasn’t the joke that triggered it.  He laughed at the joke.  It was Jada’s look that triggered it!  Common on people, get it right!
That host is 1 odd bird
"Ohhh.. Tony Rock" The molt liquor tour "I remember that" FOH
the joke didn't trigger him, his wife triggered him to smack chris because he laughed at the joke until she side eyed him..
Jada was on set...
I'm cutting this interview short!  Just lost respect for ya tommy,  appearing on the most racist and dishonest socalled news network on the planet!  You ain't got nothing I wanna hear!
Tommy Davidson looks great! I'd love to see him doing more stuff. He's hilarious
Tommy a real one for over 20 years. He will always have a place,and you can see how quick he answered that street question lol
Why is this woman so happy about this?
The distance that Will walked prior to the slap suggest something more than instinct. Moreover, Will seemed to disregard the global venue as well, suggesting incredible brazen.
I bet will ain't going to pick or smack Noone his own size
I bet he didn't  smack him
Will is OVER!!
Amazing , Will Smith was was going to beat him up over a kiss 💋 in a movie 🎥 but has no problem with her having sex with other dudes 😆
" I remember that" she's so fake. She didn't even know Tony Rock
This reflects very badly on their culture...
He just mad because he doesn't have the same level of success as will Smith
everybody got something to say  I had a run in with a butterfly  and a hoe  get off the BS Street stuff
https://youtu.be/WcQZTfEbr0o
Will Smith has that Tom Cruise ego about him.
Gee. That was a waste.
Everyday that Will Smith doesn't get charged with assault and battery. Simply says it all!   I could care less what "Hollywood" thinks, or what the cool kids say on twitter. His ass should have been escorted, in handcuffs to the county jail for assault and battery. Hypothetically,  If either you or I did and  exactly what Willy did. You or I would have a new picture from the county jail to add to our instagram collection.
From the good old in living colors, and the character he played in Juwanna Mann. Kinda hard to forget that hilarious dinner scene. 🤣
In all honestly, a decent amount of entertainers are jerks, not condoning things but I have seen in person how awful some of them can be, just like  spoiled children. My father writes for artists and I was able to meet several, they are the most moody, exhausted, unpredictable people in the world. My father had one rule, do not look at/talk to them EVER. I saw Aretha F go ham on a staff member for joking about her hair not being done. Baaaad move, she ate him then fired him.
Will should smack his cheeks too, washed-up has-been...
I hate this chick
This lady is reaching ugh
You deserve one Tommy Davidson!
If Roman Polanski and Harvey Weinstein can keep their Oscars, Will Smith should keep his.  It was about his acting ability.  However, Will Smith should be banned from the Oscars for a good long while, and nobody should hire Will while he is still with Narcissist Jada -- as she is the reason Will is like he is these days.
So many people believe the incident was actually 'staged' and that it was actually a conspiracy that was pre-planned by Smith, Rock, Pfizer, and certain high-ups with the Academy itself to try to regenerate interest in the annual event because, they theorize,  Pfizer, which is in the process of trying to develop a new drug to combat alopecia(imagine that😏🙄)is the 'leading sponsor' of the Academy Awards...😳  So even if a totally stupid, idiotic conspiracy like that WAS true, that would have to be the absolute DUMBEST IDEA IN  HISTORY concocted to try to "regenerate" interest in the Academy Awards. For me, personally, the Will Smith/ Cris Rock 'incident' made it even more likely that I'll never it watch again. It's just so hard for me to imagine Will Smith being stupid enough to walk up there unscrpted and doing that and use such shocking language in front of millions in a REAL, un-rehearsed incident.  4REAL
Will is actually Wilard
Will and Jada are toxic aholes and I have lost all respect for Will.
Violence never brings peace" - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love... Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man but to win his friendship and understanding.  The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy, instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence, you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence, you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Take care and God bless.
I love the fact that she's fishing for a negative comment and he shut her down at every messy turn👌🏽
"i remember that" um no you don't. man she is airheaded in this interview.
Will Smith's next movie will be the autobiographical true story called "Fall From Grace" and will be the sequel to his previous movie, "The way to happiness".  The actual "Fall From Grace" movie trailer was the Chris Rock Academy slap.
Unhappy wife unhappy life
Don't go watch Will Smith's movies. Simple!
Social media still talking about Will Smith while there is more serious crimes happening, They should be talking about the 18 people that was just shot in Sacramento
This is crazy, Social media act like Will Smith is the terminator going around K!lling people, It was a minor incident at a award show, Why are they making this situation bigger then what it is
who is this Tommy Davidson again? just some one else trying to get noticed on the wake of the slap?
TY FOR SHOWING UP I'VE ALWAYS LOOOOOOVED U TOMMY DAVIDSON U ARE HILARIOUS WITH UR GIFT OF TALENT ACTING AND HAVE ALLLWAYYYYYS BEEN MY FAVORITE U AND JAMIE FOX ICONNNNNNNNNNNNNS THEEEEE BEST!💗😊
That was the best explanation that I've heard. Will Smith got human. Tommy Davidson, you are the bomb!!! Loved your interview!!!
Terrible interviewer!
Will and Jada have forgotten the 90s when yo momma jokes were the norm and nobody got into fights because they were jokes duh?!
Damn everyone coming out.
4:07 Fart or Shart?  You be the Judge....Hilarious!
2:58 Shart?  Hilarious.  LOL.
Will smith , not the angel he makes out
He took the hit like nothing
Did I do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!  Legend
Tommy why would you even sit down with this creep? And on FAUX false information too?
He's doing the interview in his apartment aka his Mother's attic.
I agree 💯 no matter what he shouldn’t never want if you don’t what he did and jada shouldn’t never let him up there he ruin his reputation and career and I’m sure things are gonna get worse in their marriage
Love Tommy Davidson, but the interviewer is annoying as hell. Playing stupid and bating.
Tommy is so underrated .
Sw
Why the hell they got this old ass white woman interviewing Tommy she don't know Tony Rock she barely know who Chris Rock is
She didn't know Tony Rock was Chris Rocks brother. She did't do her homework.
B.S. ! No Excuse !    👎☹️
I wonder how much tommy  paid for these comments
I would love to see Tommy Davidson Jr  As Sammy Davis Jr. he was made for that roll!!!💪🏾💯
Man she is bad at her job.
So Will is going around picking fights with people over this disrespectful woman?  This same woman is gonna get him six feet under.
Really Tommy...
It's staged
They really be trying to gst these celebrities to pick sides🤣 smh!
She funny. He said iron it out…not air it out
He got bitch in him what he come out
Schlitz Malt Liquor  Tour, lol
Wouldn’t be surprised if the open marriage is all Jadas idea.
Tommy you are ridiculous a book scam clown 🤡 really
She's not funny
Hollywood is so dam fake
There is no justification or defense for Will Smith's asinine and violet behavior! He is too old to be so stupid and Chris should sue in foe millions which will teach him a lesson! I can name a lot of people that he wouldn't have attacked because if he had, he would have been getting up off of the floor! Thug! Dreg! Coward! Dolt! Buffoon! smdh!😡🤬
Tommy is amazing and funny.
Dull she dope she doesn’t no nothing 👀
Stay on code dummy
Black people white people show you how to do when a black man fuck with you right. Can white people be Now Now
its NOT TRUE obviously chris rock is a BULLY and shouldve NOT Picked on a woman OR A NOTHER MANS WIFE!!!!  my husband would do the same   damn  this isnt hard
Oh brother.. what Chris said did NOT trigger Will.. what triggered him was Jada's "look"👀 because he was laughing HARD initially at the light joke.
Lmao wtf is this. Lmao you didn’t mention kissing her x here you r now lol acting like you ,wanted that smoke lol. U a punk lol.lol.
Now everyone has a bad opinion. Spineless!!!
Tommy is a funny guy. Will Smith's career is over. In time he will run out of money and his mansion will be for sale. Just give it time. The bigger they are the harder that fall.
You see what the media do they try to kick up any beef they can to distract you from the real agenda wake up people...smh
If you were in the middle east you would have been dead for kissing the man's wife without her knowledge or permission...notice how he is just glossing over that important part
Lmao she really diggin 🤦🏾‍♂️
Will seems to like to roll up on smaller guys
Anyone see Will laughing at the joke about his wife?  Yeah he was under tremendous pressure.
Just cause somebody a comedian don't mean they a bitch everybody ain't Chris rock 🤷🏾‍♂️
Tommy's response to her needling and prodding was a masterclass in tastefully responding to crass, tasteless ratings seekings questions. He artfully dodged embroiling himself into unnecessary drama. Bravo!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Love you

Who doesn't love Tommy?  He's one of my favorite comedians. 😎
32 oz of that  malt liquor 😂
Who is this interviewer... she doesn't know Tony Rock...?
Chris should've got his cast mates from GROWN UPS to come jump Will
Out of touch. Tony Rock Rock. Lol
The industry is feminizing men so bad is is really showing. They are trying to cancel this man's career because he stood up for his wife. If you in the industry that is trying to cancel a man for standing up for his family then the woman that is with you should leave ASAP. We already know you are not going to stand up for her or him. Because, you are so into what the industry will think about you or your fairytale friends in the industry will think about you. I hope someone with real manners as a man will see this and share it.
Bye bye Will Smith all thanks to your wife… oh I better keep her name out of my mouth  … not!!!
Nothing human about that man. ✌🏼❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
Ohhh bs will is not a baby he's delt with alot all these uears his whole fresh prince show was making fun of people
Is this Fox host mentally ill? Seriously
All hollywood needs to be erased so depression and vanity has no place in loving each other for who we are all we do is make fun out down those who are not rich with friends and family.

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
that was not a moment  of being human....it was a moment of demonic possession and that is what you get when you gat a family living in dysfunction junction
Here we go a has been trying to use this as a means of getting back in the limelight with all that sugar in his pocket, he should have kept silent. Bootlicking time!
Tommy do better, you speaking with a bold face racist on a racist news cast!  They use guys like you  to go against other black folks!
Y’all need to quit.  Fox just as without class as usual at lease you are consistent.
"Wouldn't hurt a flea." Well ladies and gentlemen there go your problem right there.
Leave it to FOX to try to promote division between the brothers.  SMH.
He didn't even hit him
Cuz the prince is a bully, a punk, & complete piece of garbage. I disagree, the guy was laughing while his wife was making faces. It wasn't anger, before the fall comes - Pride. We all know his wife wants august so does fp
?? Everyone seems to ignore the manipulative actions of Wills wife (Jada is famous in Hollywood for being PURE HELL to work with, and just miserable to be around) as she reacted first with a smile at the joke, and then rolled her eyes in a dramatic effort to get Wills attention, then staring in Wills direction as she told him "August would never let that slide" in reference to her much younger lover (August is a friend of her son apparently.) Will must have been quite stressed that evening about his winning an Oscar, or not... so, he took the cue from his annoyed wife to prove he was not a wimp... feeling like an old man would be the result of the added stress that he must be struggling with, dealing with their very public open marriage and his wife having a public  sexual relationship with a young thug stud. (Will Smith needs to free himself of that TOXIC woman and put an end to the humiliating open marriage, as she only brings out the worst in him!)
Nobody talks about them as parents....13yr old daughter posing topless in bed with a 20yr old man...they thought that fine. [she is now polyamorous}. The son [whose best friend she Jada had sex with]is wearing skirts and thinks he is bi..These two people are emotional abusers of their children ..Nobody is bothered,the 'Slap', is small potatoes compared to the emotional abuse they've dished out to their children.
That’s Not Nice  Slapping Someone In The Face With Violence In Our Country In Our Communities Our Cities Our Streets In The Awards  No Matter Who You Are
You have to feel for a guy who is under his wife's thumb, has a wife riding her husband's coattails and looks like a simp. Will Smith and Joe Biden have a lot in common
Tommy I'm a big fan
Arrest will smith
WILL, PLEASE GET SOME HELP BEFORE YOUR BOTTLED UP RAGE DOES ANYMORE DAMAGE!
Woo
Schlitz Malt liquor tour....wow bruh🤣😂🤣😂
Will Smith is done!!! No smart person will hire him. If they want their Movie to be successful
This lady is crazy! This is why I don't watch FOX News.
This lady is instigator...smh
We don't care.😎
this woman is hot 🔥.
Fox News don’t care about black peoples but call one up to keep the fuel going. Yeah don’t talk about your feelings about being duke we don’t care.
So Tommy kissed Jada without her permission and is upset her husband had words about it?  Man, GTFOH.
Exactly what this so-called RESIGNATION really means (in legal terms) is that the Oscars gave Will Smith a SEPARATION AGREEMENT so that he has the respect of saying that he resigned so that neither has any legal complications.   Trust me, the details of no legal complications against the Oscars is part of the legal language of that contract.  I promise you that is so.   #realtalk  Jada Picket has ALWAYS been bald headed.  One lie lead to all this mess.  Like she said, she loves her bald head.  No one else would have bothered to care if she was not planting seeds of evil to the public ground in the first place.  #teamchrisrock  Chris Rock did NOT insult her.  He told her that he loved her and gave her a good idea to create a new movie similiar to GI Jane.  That could and SHOULD have been taken as a compliment.
Duh hello Tony Rock get with it lady.
Who remembers the Pizone commercial?
What would of happened. If EIIEN DeGeneres  would have made that Joke (and she would have)  ???   N O T H I N G.  !!! ❣️❣️❣️
I love all three🥰
Here we go again with the mainstream media milking this slapping incident for all its worth as they saturate negative energy through out the air ways.
Love tommy!  He'd be amazing in a Sammy Davis JR bio!!!
Shame on Will Smith. Smacking Chris Rock and humiliating him in front of his peers and the world 🌍 who does he think he is????I hope something is Done with him.. this is the big Problem with these celebrities,they think their gods and that they can say or do anything!!!Plain Disgusting 🤮
Except he made fun of someone dealing with a health condition...
If will would have slapped a white comedian he would probably be a broke mutha for long time.
The consequences of having a Jezebel as a so called entangled wife who provoked all of that just as she publicly said she sleeps with her son's friends yet w Smith was incapable of slaping Jada for such a scandal but her demon in him prefers to slap poor Chris Rock. God forbid!!
Let's move on about Will Smith a smacking Chris Rock it is what it is.  It's sad that  happened but black people don't have to beat it in the ground.  I like Will Smith and Chris Rock they both good black men's . Tommy Davidson move on   You don't have to put Will Smith down move on with your life.
Awwww he must be referring to the movie Woo. I loved his movies and wish we could see more of him.
When will the media, shut the fuck up on the slap
Yo, this interviewer sucks. She's trying to twist Tommy's words anyway she can. Fire her
Bs. If what happened at all was real. Then chriss obviously would hurt someone. Will smith apparently got angry hurt about a joke about his wife. Was his wife hurt idk. But here we see chriss verbally hurt 1-2 people in what may be a real or fake situation. Sense this guy wants to claim chriss wouldn't do something he just did. I dont believe anything he writes or says. He isnt honest. But id like us people of earth to leave the words kill me logic. Lets go back to sticks and stones can brake my bones. But words can never hurt me. Worlds full of children that grew up and didn't get this donation
This lady nosey as hell
“Give me the relationship, I don’t know the back story”   “That’s his brother”  😂😂🤣
Seriously?!  Everyone can get upset, everyone has lost it at one point or another. But demonizing someone is not fair. Is he a bully? And how do we know he is telling the truth? And if it was really that big of a deal-why come out now and why on the TV? Perhaps talk to him in person and squash it….wait-there’s no publicity that way.
I think Will is tired of ppl talking about his wife and family
All I can say white folks are having a field day and they going to drag this out into Will Smith and Chris Rock die period . While they let there people pass on through they don't keep bringing up there  pass
This ladies fart laugh is hilarious 😂
Doesn't matter what happened with him.  He committed battery on a fellow human.  He should be in jail.
Man it's a bag for anybody willing to pile on will smith right now... all the vultures is circling
This Lady is a joke... All the Will Smith coming the woodwork's.
This is a pattern. He has been obsessed with Jada. And it’s not healthy because it brings out the abusive Will Smith persona.
This violence further damaged the Blacks' image significantly.
I am from CAry and this interview was when he was in Raleigh, NC    How cool !
So Will is a bully because he addressed the situation where Tommy was in a movie with Jayda and Tommy kissed her without her knowledge it was going to happen or permission for it to happen
Living in color is how the Hawaiian introduced Tommy when I saw him perform in Kona.
She didn't know who Tony Rock is 🤣🤣🤣
Remember not that long ago,  he & his 2 kids were appalled at Miley Cyrus' performance that included her gyrating on Robin Thick & twerking, etc ( it was ridiculous, I agree), but he's okay with slapping the host during not just any awards show, but the Oscar's for petesakes 😃& unleashing a profanity filled, hissy fit on national tv...???? Comedians have dedicated full stand up routines based on Michael Jackson's eccentricities, child molestation charges & trials, having vitiligo, etc but you didnt see him throwing a fit or responding in some crazy way. Will has gotta change his "do as I say, not as I do attitude ". His family needs to get a life & realize just because they are immediately related to Will that it comes with certain privileges & exemptions.  Will's next film will probably be a biopic called "How to lose your Hollywood A list status in 60 seconds" or "Gone in 60 seconds 2".😃
So Will Smith always picks little guys to flex on basically.
What the hell is with her using her hands, is she on something
Wow!!! Will Smith is a piece of work. I always thought Smith was a cool guy. Unreal. What a jerk!🤦🏽‍♀️
Strut up at a famous event with millions watching and slap another...he's going through some shit hell...  he's lost his mind. The struts back like a peacock to sit down.
I have a more visceral reaction to the slap, I have lost all respect for Will Smith, but my respect for Chris and the way he handled himself has soared, Chris was hurt both physically and emotionally, yet he showed a great deal of integrity, I wish I could hug him and tell him how proud I am of him!
WHO CARES?????????
Loved movies tommy was in the 90's  He exuded an innocence you dont see much by actors nowadays even with his comedy he exuded it. Wayans brothers have the same thing. DL has it. But most other comedians dont. Innocence is somethi g that stays with you even when you think it is lost.
Maybe will will become like mchammer and no one will dare say anything bad about him🤣🤣😂
We who are clinging to our sanity must remember that right now most people are nuts! Meanwhile, Satan is trying to distract us ALL. There is so much more going on than movies, laughing, and Will and Jada and Chris. Seriously, we need to calm down and trust God. He's still on the throne.
U ask him to go outside?!! She's messy
This woman tried to bait Tommy but he avoided each stab with the grace of Bruce Lee.
Tommy  go on real TV... Keep it 💯. Go on Roland S Martin show..  Where they care about black people... You people never really cared about black people Or a Brown people...
Sorry Tommy. We don't give a crap that Smith is worried about whether he would get the Oscar.  That's no excuse to ASSAULT anyone for any reason on the 93rd Academy Awards show seen around the World.  He's an entitled bully and people need to realize that.
We are all human he made a mistake let’s move on
That's that West Philly gangster
I have been telling this story for years.  Tommy Davidson was playing Will Smith in Woo.  Jada even had another guy play 2pac and he was punking Tommy Davidson through the whole scene.  If you watch Woo from Will Smith perspective you can see how Jada has no respect for Will.
Funny how noone came out before and spoke about their run ins. It's like a "Me too" movement.  Everybody is trying to get in on it. Smh
She caught you off guard.
Davidson is so underrated...
She is awful
He didnt become human, he became a violent entitled celebrity thug.
Why are you even on here talking to this witch? 😔☹️
"Haaaaaaated it!" Gay vacations was so damn funny.
3:27 ain't nobody notice chris almost go after will and him catch himself and not do anything
WS should be canceled others have been canceled for much less
I don't play that mess don't talk about my husband are kids you all are crazy. I feel sorry about the world situation about Chris and also for Will for the one moment that messed up his life. That everyone wants to keep talking about it hurting Chris as well as Will. Chris as bigger than all if you. All we can do is pray about it. Everyone leave it a lone one mess will Will every leave it down everyone deserve a second chance. Thank God for Chris you all are hurting him also let it go.
WS went at him because Rock is half his size
I have gone right off Smith. Espeially after the other times he’s done that to other actors, comedians, fellow series actors (remember the original Mother in Fresh Prince? Who said he made her life hell and turned others against her and that she had to quit in the end?).  I think Smith is an egotystical bully who thinks he is far better than he actually is. Did you know that ‘Smith’ in Anglo Saxon language means ‘To hit’?? Figures. He should lose his Oscar. PERIOD
So Will's kind of a bully especially towards smaller men..... that's weak.
How is he a bully cause he was defending his wife ?Stupid mfs
He's right of course; It is an Oscar worthy Sammy Davis Jr. impression.
I remember the movie "WOO" with Jada and Tommy. He was funny asf. Always loved Him💝
That movie will was in was lame idk why he would win an Oscar for that way over acting
The hostess keeps on farting 😂
How come no one is asking DJ Jazzy Jeff, what he thinks. 🤔
Since the world found out about Jada and 2Pac, Will been having something to prove.
he became real demonic 💩
Tommy Davidson was about to give Will Smith his fade
Wish Tommy would have shared more specifics of his encounter with "Jerk Smith".
Hollywood walking around finding all these people who all of a sudden had all these issues with will.     Sounds like they're bill cosbyng will smith.   Will you need to retire.   Once hollywood start bullying you its over.
Tommy didn't steve harvey threw you off tour for drugs.    So when your on drugs you have run iins with many people.
Hollywood your are really bullies.   Now the whole Hollywood had an issue with will smith.    I dont believe none of them.    They're  just bullying the smith family.
Tommy Davidson had a run i. With the police all the time too.
Chris reacted that way because he new it was coming. Yep, the Oscar always set up drama like a flappy titty woman, then turn around and act innocent and classy. Sounds familiar?
She's trying to push the man into saying something bad. He is just stating the truth and you want to turn it into something else. It's true the Smith's were under a lot of media pressure and Will was just taking everything. I said it before he was at his tipping point in a Sense. The Oscar set him up, plain and simple
When emotions is high common sense is at a low. Needs to go on a t shirt
Tommy got hands. Will would've got his ass beat.
This lady is a bird brain…
Problem is the marriage, not a joke or a specific individual. Guys know what they want in a relationship. If it’s not happening some get divorced, some dismiss the reality, live in frustration trying to control what they can’t.
Will would whoop Tommy's @ss.. What's up with these washed up has been comedians/actors coming out the wood work clout chasing?
He looks great! Hasn't hardly aged at all. Will Smith liked to go after people smaller than himself.
"it was just a point where he became real human." - a very privileged human who thinks he's allowed do assault people who tell jokes. Most people realize that's wrong.
The host be like, “ why not , why not” they really love their drama don’t they? . For all yall racist white folk, Will Smith nd Chris rock will rise again and they aint nothing yall can do about it.
It’s incredible that these stories are just cascading out now. EVERYBODY is talking about what a bully Smith is.
Will never had this energy for PAC? What a sucker
Tommy is awesome! He should be on screen more!
Wow surprised to hear more people on TV actually admit that will is human and made a human mistake smh. I don't know how from a slap people got to worshipping Chris Rock as some kind of deity or Nobel peace prize winner for not reacting smh lol. But this entire situation was just that....human!!
Didn't recognize Tommy
Tommy Davidson is some  kind of guy. He's a plausible comedian.
He became real human, the best thing ever said.
AZ https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
This interviewer is horrible with her spurts and sound effects.
I would say, a person might be kind, wouldn't hurt a flea, but can say harmful, mean words that can hurt.  I do think Smith should not have struck Chris, that was very very wrong and unexpected. He's a comedian.  Maybe Smith has turned into a different guy after all the money, power, fame and accolades. I don't know.  But a comedian can do damage with his words. Chris did not retaliate and remained calm. You can say something about both of them, but Smith was wrong to hit him and to hurl curse words at him while seated.
Most people don’t know Tommy was a boxer also ..  Will smith would have Been in for a rude awakening lol
So Willard and Judas pinky Smiff shows the world what a toxic and sick marriage looks like on the world's biggest stage. When you have a partner or spouse who hates your worldwide celebrity, you better believe that there is a mission to bring you down.
Be careful who you tread on , on the way to the Top comes to mind
I was at the McDonald's on 95th and I cut in front of Jada and will smith came up and smacked my neck 🧣 , I was sad 😢
Lol, she doesn't know Tony Rock?
We've all seen Tommy's moves as Kung Fu Master Sweet Tooth Jones on In Living Color. The Fresh Prince wants no part of that.
Varnell hill
This interviewer wasn’t interested in Tommy and his work she wants drama about Will and Chris and because he’s a comedian and black she thinks he knows what to do and how Chris feels 🤦🏽‍♂️ People have to do better
I miss this Actor Tommy Davison. Where I've watched actors grow up on tv. From goofy young unwanted shows too old elders all repeated shows connected from one decade too the next,as I watched phenomenonal black actors disappear.. Ijs
#puglife   https://youtube.com/shorts/PhD1tUzRzCo?feature=share
Damn...she was desperately trying to create drama for Tommy. She wanted him to say something negative about the situation between Will & Jada or even Chris her attempts fell flat.
The social structure has no clue about the governance structure 🤣🤣🤣She had never heard of Tony Rock 😆😆😆😆
His impersonation of Sammmy Davis was so good, does he still do stand up?
This host is on another planet
This gonna be like the me too movement with people coming forward with old ass incidents.
I wish they would stop showing the clip. I feel so bad as if seeing it for the first time. I can't shake it.
Kinda what I've been thinking. That's not the first time Will Smith has acted like a bully & self entitled 🙄
Roid rage.......!
Tommy challenged Will and Will backed down , Will is a beeyatch!
😭😭
Everybody coming out bout Will Smith now.. like he getting Me Too’d 😂
Shouldn't have kissed his wife bruh
"when emotions are high, common sense is at a high time low"- tommy davidson  thanks tommy I really needed to hear that, and may god help us not to let our emotions overpower our common sense.
I love Tommy's humor,  he always had me rolling.
Slap on rye pick it up!!!
Every irrelevant star wants to use this incident as an opportunity to resurrect their dead career and every media outlet simply wants to gossip for ratings instead of educating the public about something actually meaningful.
Always liked Chris Rock hes way funnier and more down to earth then Will who's a weirdo and crybaby
Tommy: "Singh, you got any plastic wrap, man?  Singh: Yeah, in the back...next to the onions..."  Bernie Mac: "Glad wrap at 2 in the morning? It looks like you're planning on eating more than a sandwich, boy..."
Will Smith need psychiatric help ASAP!. He need to enter a mental rehab ASAP!.
Chris Rock got his face slapped hard. Wow!.
Great to see Tommy Davidson. Loved In Living Color. Always thought it and Mad TV were funnier than SNL.
I remember Tommy in, "In living color." My favorite comedy sketch show, except for "Mad tv."
What a dingbat.
It's funny how Will has a problem with what comes out of Chris's mouth, however he doesn't have a problem with what goes into his wife's mouth!!
Tommy Davidson,Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier are my favorite comedians.
Tommy is hilarious! He was hysterical on In living color! I LOVED that show!!!
Will would have a hell of a time with the all almighty "Wachutu Fighter!"
If Will didn't use his shoulder roll 😂 Chris thought about leading with a right hook🧐. He wasn't wasting any haymakers. I think Chris is going to get him back one day. Comedians are angry ppl inside I think
Is will alright?
Will need to divorce Jada and soon.
Tommy this fuck is not funny. I feel bad for both Will and Chris. Brother do not let these people manipulate you.
Daaaannnngggg Will really loves Jada
This lady sure wanted dirt. I show unity with both men. Families stick together lady.
Jada is a toxic woman
Man,, everyone has a Will Smith story now.. All Will did was bring A TON of negative attention to his family and marriage (again). Not to mention he's probably going to start losing contracts and sponsors next.. SMH
Man i miss Tommy Davidson. I still quote Booty Call to this day. Love that movie
I had a run in with Will Smith, in a playground in west Philadelphia
Chris should have said, I will keep her name out of my mouth, until from August thru December
Chris Rock is very good in fargo
My wife and I went ro see Tommy Davidson at a comedy show in Arlington Texas and he was so damn funny.   He also talked to us after the show and rook pictures with both of us. He had an interesting life growing up. Loved him on Living Color and he is a very bright man. He's real too!
What goes around will come around. Jada will slap him and leave him and Noone will come to Will Smith's rescue.
Old news
Why talk to the crazies at fauxnews?
So good to see Tommy !  He has brightened some gloomy days in my life with his comedy.  I would like to thank him.
Bro this title makes it seem like he crossed paths with a mass murderer or some shit lmao
That pressure balloon that says, oh I'm going to commit assault and battery on a guy whose only job is to make people laugh.  Wow.
Will must be arrested  He committed a crime on live television
Tommy, you are one of the greatest comedians of all time. Thankyou for all the joy and laughter you’ve given to the world
The legend Tommy Davidson
Raleigh NC! Amazing!
I love me some Tommy Davidson! Freakin hilarious man! His impersonations have made me light weight pay the water bill on myself. Stay safe and in great health! Getting your book asap
So good to see Tommy !  He has brightened some gloomy days in my life with his comedy.  I would like to thank him.
Will Smith low key been a punkass for a long time. Now all his shit is gonna come out. Get ready.
I love me some Tommy Davidson! Freakin hilarious man! His impersonations have made me light weight pay the water bill on myself. Stay safe and in great health! Getting your book asap
this reporter is awful
Another somebody who should have his own TV show!!
He does a great sugar ray Leonard also 🤚🏽
Tommy, what a brilliant man.  I’ve missed him.
The plot thickens not a one off but a massive misstep on live TV in front of millions of witnesses who will discuss the slap for 2 weeks even more than ukraine
People are telepathic and can hear your inside voices and read your minds to see the future using pictures videos and sitting near you
Tommy, what a brilliant man.  I’ve missed him.
I like how this woman helped with pushing his book.
...can''t get over jenifer lopez was cast member of in LIVIN'' COLOR...!!!
From goat to pos that’s what will did
I don't think that slap was real. If it was, that was fkd up!
🤭😂😂 Tommy's "yeah right 🙄" eye roll at 3:39 has me dying. He is definitely one of the Greats 👏
When emotions are at an all time high ,  common sense is at an all time low. Wow if that doesn’t give a synopsis on today’s society I don’t know what else need to be said. Well said Mr. Tommy Davidson.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning. 3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. (John 1:1-3)
If someone based an Internet meme on you, it would have impeccable grammar.
It's not nearly over with as she stated.  Chris has many people in his corner. Will Smith will be vilified for what he did.  It's not okay! No more respect or movie watching for me.  I salute, and applaud CHRIS ROCK for his poise, and professionalism.
Chris is apparently keeping it classy even when folk heckle Will at Chris' recent standup comedy shows. This interview is yet another receipt on how Jada is Will's kryptonite boo.
Howard Tibbs the 3rd, do you have a business card man you know I'm fresh out BAM. A skit Tommy did on in living color.
Will Smith = Career over
I was on a Southwest flight with Tommy Davidson once, and he was quite nice and down to Earth. He is genuinely funny too.
This woman is whack . 🙄
Love Tommy, his Hammer impression on In Living Color puts me in tears every time lol
The way Chris reacted and handled it in the moment is true showmanship. Didn’t skip a beat, cracked a joke and went right on with the presentation. I feel so horrible for him, that happened in front of the world and literally ALL his peers. And now this resulting media circus.
She's drunk
Shes a bird!!
Chris Rock is a total class act. He deserves all the praise he is getting. He could have let the incident devolve into a mess. He could have thrown fists with Will Smith, he could have had Will Smith arrested and removed from the theater, which should have happened. Will Smith should not have been able to get up on stage and accept that Oscar, and get the ovation. Hollywood are a bunch of spineless worms for giving him an ovation after the bullshit he pulled.
All I know is Will is 2 face  .. laughing at the situation
this Smith guy must have a history of this behavior.
Tommy is so funny, he stay’s stuck in my head.
Shocking!
I've noticed the design in Tommy's undershirt kinda matches the picture behind him. How cool😎

ALL the comedian should be scared because y'all take jokes too far. They're paid bullies. Chris Rock went off-script and got his face slapped for it. All For Laughs
Tommy Davidson is a great comedian. He was one of the funniest on In Living Color. I don't like Chris Rock's style of comedy that much, but he does have his funny insights.
A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls (Proverbs 25:28).
Will suffers from PTSjada Disese Because his wife cut his nuts off and as toxic narcissist the night was about Her! I welt sorry for Will’s Mother.. what that BITCH did to him I know of.
On April 2, on People, Will Smith said he had applied to withdraw from the Academy as a member and would accept all sanctions and disciplinary measures after the act of slapping Chris Rock on the Oscar stage. 94th time.  “My actions in slapping Chris Rock were unforgivable. The list of people I've hurt is long, including Chris Rock, his family and friends, my loved ones, and an entire global audience. I betrayed the trust of the Academy.”
"Chris Rock kept his head when everyone else was losing theirs" - said by the producer of the show, and that's mighty true. Mr Davidson here also seems a rational, articulate and friendly man, and just reading up on his early start in life broke my heart.
The man exudes Sammy Davis Jr essence even when he is not in character.
Jeez, who is this woman...she is a babe!
I remember homie the clown beating Tommy over the head with some stuffilled sock. homie don't play that!
I don't see enough of Tommy Davidson. I want to see more of him in films, more shows, more guest spots on other people's shows! The man is a comic genius!
Dude ... did Will fake slap you too?
Hide yo mans Hide yo kids Hide everybody  Cuz will smith out here slapping erybody
We need Charlie Murphy r.i.p.

"You can take the Childreeeeeeen....." finish it y'all
His 'Marriage' is a total open book that being his bedroom and personal buisiness.
I'm a 50% fan of him Tommy but he's selling out due to the Hollywood and the Illuminati situation jobs so on this point in his view he's a sellout. He's looking at his money not as hart. I've seen him in interviews that he talks about people he was damn good but it's not a stand-up guy. I love his comedian style but he's a sellout. I'm like Forrest Gump that's all I have to say about that???.👎👎👎👎👎💯💯💯👎👎👎👎🤣🤣🤣
Why do we have to watch the assault as we're listening to Tommy Davidson speak? Like... it's triggering and we all saw it the first time.
Chris Roc got slapped not raped (gotdamn)...
Tony Rock has a filthy mouth.  Beware!
Chris Rock was not on Raw he ain't Eddie Murphy and he was at a white professional Academy Awards so Chris should had acted professional and not make a joke with someone with a medical condition f** twat.
She didn’t know who Tony was🙄
Stop talking about past events it’s only making look worse
Stop telling personal information the media doesn’t know just shut the f up❗️❗️❗️
All I think about when I see him is My ice cream sandwich..🤣🤣

Will Smith,  a Bully.....No Surprise there.  Of course his Mother says different....you know that was a Lie.
It’s crazy how no one heard about Chris rock’s Brother , until this.
No excuse. Will Smith is an animal
if only Rock would had been Micheal Jai White, how different of an outcome wed all be laughing at #willcucksmith #freshbitchofbelair
Over and over she tries to bait him into a hot take.
Bottom line   people are people   black and white can find common ground on whats right and whats wrong. Period...
Real Human ?
Jeez! How delicate IS Will Smith's ego? Tommy and Chris are so funny and way above Mr.Smith!
Whey is Tommy on racist ass fox News 😒 🙄
Stop it, Chris Rock is no GD saint. He had already worn out that Alopecia GI Jane joke and knew it.
I thought tommy was gay ? I guess I'm wrong
Yeah Will got scare. Scare o his wife.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jada. She a ...........................
i mean did the smiths discipline their kids by hitting growing up? cuz seems like occasionally will believes that's the correct approach to problems
Love Tommy Davidson since living colour… pure class and deserves a resurgence in his career
Are all the FOX hosts drunk on air?
Is that Jeanine Pirro???
Tommy came in like Varnell from the Martin Lawrence Show 😂😂
Hollywood's a bunch losers. All. How many in gitmo..?
It's  fox news so this wasn't unexpected  because who doesn't know tony rock is Chris rock's brother they say we all look alike and Tony rocks favors Chris rock 🤭😂😂
Why was that lady farting so much?
Chris Rock rocks. What a strong, nice man. Bullies pick on those they deem vulnerable. There is a family member in my family who is a closet bully. Everyone thinks oh what a good man. Privately, he bullies any member he perceives as weak, young/old.
Wait is that Oscar Proud?? 😭
Chris didn’t trigger it, he was laughing and clapping. He only lost it went he felt bad when she saw him laughing.
Will smith is a coward
If everyone ignores the staged slap that was promotion for " I am legend 2 " and Jada's talk show, the hype will go away. #FactsPlusTax
https://youtu.be/NVfIpr5K0oI
do not pretend you are going to state something  re smith and then back out -  minimizing everything - it makes you look like you have noting to share  nothing but I do not know
What the hell is wrong with Will
CORRECTION Two GOOD Men/Dudes
Everyone is going crazy but we all are not different from what will Smith did
To Good Dudes NYC and West Philadelphia  come together use incident to change Violent Movies Hollywood pushes out
Nobody likes Will Smith after that slapping!✋incident? 🙄
No one had been checking for unfunny, corny ass Tommy Davidson for DECADES. Why is he relevant now? Oh yeah, he is jumping on the Slapgate bandwagon to gain relevance.
You're one of the greats Tommy!! Much love!!
Again...excuses...STOP!
Blah...........
Still waiting for that public apology from that big MF no IG BS
The movie is "Woo". So funny.
These news networks are terrible and they instigate so much 😠. Let these men heal in peace and stop talking about
The slap was staged Davison and other looking for a paycheck
He only picks on little people
Tommy Davidson had a incident with Will Smith. Ok but always remember Charlie Murphy had a incident with Chris Rock.
https://youtu.be/xRMKIs7RzPQ
1991 Will Smith made a joke on the Arsenio Hall show about one of the shows band members being bald..    from Alopecia....
I see where Will picks on his grown son a lot and tries kissing him.
Chris rock handled the situation waaaay better than how Will Smith handle his "wife" (the wife of many)😎  Chris is tough as a rock👍👍👍👍👍 it's obvious why Will is not happy in the open marriage. Will should have divorce Jada long time ago. She got him by the balls.  THAT IS TRUTH
So apparently Will been flipping out over Jezebel Jada. But she never pulls up for him🤔damn she's definitely his downfall. I actually feel sorry for him. I think she's an abuser 🤷
She does ALOT of prying but her voice is so sweet and loving I’ll give her a pass
Will Smith should be bandit from the The Oscars give his Oscar back because he may he look bad at the Oscars yes for Black people then they should let Chris rock host the Oscars again and we don’t care Is Will Smith wife don’t come she not gonna take up for him she might be with another man by then Chris rock already rich you just slapped him into fame This remind me of the movie trading places
More distraction techniques from Hollywood
The primitive brain took over the flight or fight and chose the latter. 🤣
It’s all coming out now…I never liked Will Smith. Lots of hidden, seething rage that he channeled with insults disguised and sold as hip humor by Hollywood.
What are you talking about “What Chris said might have triggered it”? Smith was laughing UNTIL he saw his delicate flower of a wife’s face. THAT is what triggered it. Not what Chris Rock said. She can’t take a joke about herself…just like Trump.
So basically he made NO EFFORT to confirm an unscripted kiss with Jada and is trying to paint Will as a bully? Why are people completely unphased by randomly kissing women? Like Jim Carey and Alicia Silverstone? I swear this slap brought out all the racists and misogynists.
Will not confronting no one who could whip his ass or retaliate bottom line
Chris Rock acted like a real pro.  Will Smith acted like a bully and punk. and then like a Hollywood Privileged DB afterwards.  The real mind blowing occurrence from the Oscar's were these Hollywood hypocrites giving a Standing Ovation to W. Smith!!
Will Smith had Janet Hubbard ( Aunt Vivian) from the "Fresh Prince" had her black ball in Hollywood. I would love to hear her reaction, since she was  around Will for quite a while in the early years
👋🏻
😂Tommy like Will was coming at me how he looked that night(slapping Chris Rock)
# SLAP WILL SMITH next bad movie he puts out
Tommy!
Yeah,  but Chris Rock still said some fuck up shit!
It's "politically correct" to say out right, or imply, that Will Smith can act well or he's is a "Great Actor" However, If you look back at the examples of his acting, what you see he hasn't  improved much since The Fresh prince of Bel air. And he was a HORRIBLE actor in that series. He has, however been in a few good movies, Men in Black, being one  example, but Will himself is not the deciding factor that makes the the few movies that he "stars" in good movies. It can be more attributed to good writing and the fact that Will's surrounds himself with supporting actors who are far more skilled at the craft of acting than he is.
this ‘slap’ was sponsored by pfizer. please focus & ignore all any news on research safety data, laptops & biolabs. thanks !
So, he kissed a woman without telling her? Where is the outrage for that? It makes perfect sense for Will to confront him.
Will Smith making fun of Arsenio Hall's band member who had alopecia, and says it's "just a joke (1991) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQVAqgJrrNU
Tommy got #me tood
Tommy Davidson DID do one hell of a Sammy Davis Jr. impersonation.
So Will was upset about Tommy kissing her on a movie set, but he was cool with August banging her in his house.
It's right that Will Smith should be castigated as well as the Oscars for allowing this violence on stage to happen- what if Will Smith was able to sneak in a gun then he could have shot Chris Rock in the head. This matter should be taken seriously and it ain't no joke at all. Ok?
"Sweet and loving guy"?
I don't know why so many are glorifying the way Chris Rock is handling it.  Continuing with the show great.  Doing nothing about the attack is equally stupid!  Sue his butt to the hilt.  Is Chris Rock trying to play gangsta!  BS!  Sue him!!  And sue the Academy for not having proper security!  Doing nothing is STUPID!!
I think this is interesting, how a person's action can cause almost immediate division, there was the same reaction when trump won the presidency, it caused, and still to this day , division among Americans, here we have a clear , open and shut case of an assault, on live television, and here we go again, divisiveness! I believe Mr. Rock should sue the Academy Awards , he needs to hittem where it gonna hurt , or possibly both Will Smith and the Academy Awards!
Peace and love to you Tommy ❤
Will smith ain’t playing no more
Jada didn't MAKE Will do a darn thing. He holds feelings of ownership toward his partner (an family) and THAT is his kryptonite. STOP BLAMING JADA and take a look inside yourselves to see if you are being a patriarchal misogynist.
yes, true important journalism right here! Most important thing going on in the world now. /s
I've loved Tommy since his Living Colour days. He is so damn funny and quick witted. I never understood how he didn't get more comedy roles in big movies.
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose again, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
I will state it here and vouch for the fact that Tommy Davidson has always been a gentleman ever since his early days.  Truly a funny and gifted man. 👍✔️
Who is this interviewer ? She doesn’t even know who Tony Is. Come on, man
Judge Piro looking hot as always, I  would love to go out with her. ❤☠💋☠

these 2 deserve each other. what garbage
They say I’m juice wrld 2.0 are they right?
Let it go!! 46th post.
This sounds like sexual assault??? Tommy probably should of kept this story..
❤️Tommy Davidson
This cringe fest is now with me for the day. This is a news network? That is considered a host? Jeeeezuss! *returns to hole in the fence leading back to old real world
tommy is roll on the floor funny.. dude is a stand up man as well.
Why is this Karen acting so dumb? “Were you guys gonna handle it in a street type of way”.
SO.........WHAT......
Will Smith's black privilege will protect him.
LOL. Thanks Will and Chris for revealing how SSSSSTTTTTTUUUUUUPPPPPIIIIIIIIDDDDD BP can be. Also want to say thanks for showing the world why BP are ALWAYS last. Any progress or chance of doing better collectively as BP has just been ruined thanks to Will and Chris and the reaction from..... BP. When would BP EVER Effin LEARN?!!!! When ??? Smdh. 🤦🏽😔
Cool title for the book! Bravo!
He should have slept with Jada and Will would shake his hand and have him over for dinner. Just don't say anything that could be misconstrued as a insult,  while you stick it in her.
Varnell Hill " did ya miss me"......yeah Tommy we sure do, we sure do
This Chic is a typical, rude ass interviewer!!. She's trying extremely hard  to get Tommy to say negative things about Will. We can READ BETWEEN THE LINES Ma'am...DAMNIT! No more smoke needs to be added to the damn incident. Glad Tommy held his tongue and composure. Ya'll so-called journalists...smh
These devils always looking for drama
So good seeing Tommy Davidson again!! Hopefully, he'll be back on TV soon.
Pretty sure Will Smith can't throw down in a fight. He wascompensating for his cowardice.
This news caster soubds exactly like Judge Jenene Piro
#gohomegota2022
Most underrated comedian imo
you air your problems and your life, its all good to go after!!!!!
hes a jerk. Willis is a jerk. hes messed up.
willis has always been a punk. over blown with his own importance. he dies no one will care just like all the other people.
I'm beginning to see that these comedians are undercover bullies  or clowns. They do this because they were either picked on or wouldn't  retaliate to events  in their youth.. A loving person wouldn't try and undercover kiss. I met Tommy Davidson and he's and undercover flirt ready to cheat. People are rude if you don't  like each other don't use a platform like the Oscar as your backup. I think all of you are a disgrace....a joke should not come on anothers  disability, race or choice. These comedians went to far with gay people until they bought against it. I stopped  comedy's shows all together, when laughter replace pains. I arrives at concerts late because,  if the opening acts  ate comedians and the how far willthey take it. Do they need censorship? Yes, if the quality  of your joke can be offensive  to others.
Will is a bully...and a coward
Violence shouldn't be condone in anyway or anywhere at the same time Chris have crossed the line couple of times he shouldn't make fun of someone's sickness it's not cool.Smith defended his wife who couldn't defend herself against Chris but all the same Will you didn't have to do that should have waited and speak to the brother privately. You tarnished your image that moment for good.
So no one is going to address the fact that Tommy is admitting to assaulting Jada and trying to make himself a victim because her husband came to check him about it? This is gross.
Comedians running wild on Will Smith now!🤣🤣🤣
Sounds like it is all coming out now. Seen quite a few videos with a common denominator about Will…insecure but manifesting it through being a bully. I like Will and he always comes across as a very friendly sweet guy.  But I guess he like other human beings has some hidden ugly characteristics whether inherent of through social & family environments. Perhaps he needs help or something.  But shout out to Chris Rock for being the better man.
white people acting like this is the most violent thing they've ever seen in history but can't stop laughing and making memes about it lol.
Didn't this woman know who Tony Rick is? 🙄🙄
So?
all Will's dirty laundry coming out!
https://youtu.be/7KFXTpvkmN4
Remember: Klingons believe we Earthlings had no sense for humor because we don't find it funny to slap somebody who is at sleep. Slapping somebody who has his hands behind his back is like slapping a sleeping man.
Booty call? 🤣

Yall got you feet so far up Will yall now wearing him as slippers. The dog is down and the people are kicking...smh
Celebrities are now feeling comfortable to let it all out and speak about their experiences with Will Smith. Looks like another Ellen degeneres. Fake. All smiles and positivity for the camera.
The academy is lying now that chris rock stopped them from removing will smith!...lmao....bullshut
guess what?...the oscars are covering their ass now sayin they tried to remove mr.smith but chris rock stopped them!..lmoa...ur diggin the grave deeper dude
Tommy came here to Baltimore class act nicest guy gave a few autographs …
Chris is the real man!
I like this.
The kingdom of the Lord is at hand humble yourselves, renounce the sin that clings so closely & repent and believe in the name of  yeshua for the remission of your sins christ died for us so live for him. even if you don’t believe give him a try no matter what he will accept you even if you’ve never believed since birth.. confess with your mouth and believe with your heart truly believe and you shall be save it takes nothing but faith Trust Me you will feel him id rather die believing and there not be life after then there be life after and not believing Jesus knew he would be the most hated but despite that still gave up his life for us believe in that and ye shall be saved. the blood of Jesus poured for our sins so you don’t have to go to hell. God can work wonders if you let him just a little of your time. God is there for you
He told him to go outside and speak to him as  a man. ROSANA SCOTTO! STOP TRYING TO PUT SALT IN THE SITUATION
Will Smith got that "my kid's a trans. weirdo" rage goin'....  #officallyonnotice
willSmith think he wasnt intoxicated on something. You think he's just sitting there drinking soda
I want more to standup specials
Our Nation is in great dispear and the black population needs to get they're shit together fast and stop all the whining about discrimination and why, why, why! Come on!!!!!!!!!!!
That’s not human. That’s bully.
Jada got him in some panties
That smug look on Will’s face after the smack is disgusting 🤮
Sha-Boing-Boing Man
Will smith is a force not to be reckoned with you risk having hand prints on your face for years
woo-this woman is messy
The slap was unforgivable but the volume of the verbal abuse which Smith screamed showed how out of control he was.  To me that was even more traumatic. Chris is a great example of how to behave and be in control and I salute him.
"It goes to prove that the bigger man isn't necessarily bigger in stature but in heart and internal strength."
Un poco de mi Spam 🎶🐼👀 https://youtu.be/fYa2o-1wMdk
I bet Will will make up for it.
So you are going to pretend like you don’t know that G.I. Jane reference is always used to put black women who are strong and powerful in a position where they are accused of being a lesbian as if that is a bad thing. You are also going to act like he did not try to play a Street game of the dozens with Will Smith and his wife at a procedures venue during a time where the talent of other black Americans should have been honored instead of making a mockery of them and all of their work. He knows that Hollywood has made fun of black women and cast them as really horrible people for a really long time he could’ve done something to honor her and other talented black actresses but he chose to step on her neck instead I don’t feel sorry for him at all
Tommy kissed Jada without permission and is shocked that Will checked him? The fuck
The movie is called Woo

Good job on handling this, Tommy. Wish you had a higher profile, my bro!
Love Tommy. He a great actor and comedian.
Thank God will didn't slap tommy he would of flew back stage!
The Oscar should have not went to Will Smith for pulling a stunt like that
Thanks Chris for keeping it together and classy through it all.  This could have ended differently.
I dwill never watch another Will Smith movie.  There is nothing I hate more than a bully.  He made a lot of people look bad.  I really don't like that the young people watched this ignorance.  It's hard enough getting them to respect others.  It could have been handled differently.  He would have never done this to Dre, Snoop, 50 Cent. IJS
Will goes after an even smaller dude.   so gangster...im so impressive...
Will Smith's performance in "King Richard" was not Oscar worthy in my opinion.  There, I said it!
Without common sense, it's hard to know right from wrong ✉     #😕
My first thought when I seen his name is when he was hooked up on a blind date with Wanda
This makes me dislike Will even more, especially after I heard Paul Rodriquez’s experience! He disgusts me!!!
Bandwagon, jump on..
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! If you haven't had a personal relationship with god your creator, he's calling you to him and he loves you very much. He died on the cross for our sins, was buried and rose on the third day so we wouldn't be separated from god and experience eternal death (hell) he desires that we know him and be saved so we may not perish but have eternal life. If we repent (turn from our sins) and turn to god believe in Jesus, get baptized in Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of our sins  become born again, filled with his holy spirit and follow him he gives us peace, comfort and joy in the holy spirit and a new life!. He brings hope to the hopeless, Healing to the brokenhearted, freedom to the captives, and can heal you and set you free. He sees everything and knows what you deal with. He's the only way to heaven. There is no other way in which man can be saved. If you die today where would you go?
Love Tommy💙 Isn’t Tommy a Black belt? I might be thinking about another comedian…🤔
Will Smith  Will Smith  Supporting Will Smith with loved 🥰   Chris rock is the goofy psychopathic comedian making fun to somebody’s personal life that’s why he deserves the biggest slap in history
Will smith did the right thing to slap the goofy psychopathic comedian Chris rock because of his abusive f**|<ing mouth  If your personal life and your family making fun by goofy psychopathic comedian? Do you thing that is cool? Hell NO! Chris rock is so much more disrespectful specially to humble guy will smith personal life
He bullied Paul Rodriquez too.
what does in a street kind of way mean?
Yeah right Tommy. .  Iron it out my ass
The Academy asked Chris Rock "Whats wrong?"     Beats me? What did will smith leave on Chris rocks face?   Fresh fingerprints of Belair What did he order at McDonalds?  A slap happy meal    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCIP_-P2vYE
Such a crazy situation. I did a video about this on my channel https://youtu.be/kHF25xYNbCo
yo will thats wrong this is all we got to put a hand on a brother your wrong man
this will smith stuff has become so big its actually crazy
Blacks have taken over The Oscar's! Make USA Great again! Well somebody had to!!!!
Psy-en-tology persons can do no wrong...Right???
So he kissed Jada without her permission and Will rolled up on him? Nothing to see here. This is clout chasing because no one is checking for Tommy. This interview added absolutely nothing. How do we know it happened the way he said it? I don't trust anyone in Hollywood. There are a lot of predators slithering all around that industry. I'm sure a Me Too story is going to come out about him next.
Define slapstick comedy the truth hurts
Let it go the shyt is over this old azz lady over here punkin Tommy don't talk it No 🚫
But yes. Chris  would hurt a person in a second for a laugh. Hurt is hurt. People often say people should be able to deal comedians. Well it seems comedians need to learn how to take a hurt too. In whatever format it comes !
I was. About too talk about you and how you cried in Wife Swap. Crying about the white man being mad at you. But, then you bought up other things.

Well now we  that Janet Hubert was right about Smith's attitude, but why didn't he slap 2 pac ?,
She didn't think they were trying to work it out amicably, she thought it meant to fight. In a street kind of way? Smh.
👀
Who's this gorgeous woman
Tommy i love you, always have, always will...you rock baby❤❤
To my eyes, a lot of celebs do grossly immoral things without batting an eye and then do a post or a video to tell everyone why it's actually good and people lap it up ... or in this case, they have a slick PR/legal person on payroll who can slap together a polite-rude Insta 'apology'. Everyone is presuming Rock knew about Jada's medical condition. Did he? If so, Smith could've used his words and had an actual 'conversation' with him like regular people have to do when they have a dispute with a colleague. Or maybe ... I know this may sound somewhat radical, but maybe Jada could've had her own discussion with Rock.
good job Tommy

So you sexual assault Jada and were surprised you were checked for it.

I can tell you what happened, Will laughed at the joke and then looked at Jada and saw she wasn’t happy!
she fishing HARD! lol
Miss Tommy's physical comedy
Will Smith is a joke of a dude
So he forcibly kissed Jada (it wasn't part of the script), but he's mad at Will for confronting him about it.. And people are cheering him on?? Is this opposite world??
Wow, having not seen Tommy for a great number of years, he is still, I mean STILL a cutey.  I don't think I've seen him in anything since "In Living Color" went off the air in the mid-90's which I watched religiously and I remember I had a huge crush on him back then. There was also another person on that show Scott Thompson "The Church Lady" who didn't excite me but I loved to watch as well. It's a shame that show isn't in syndication today because it was an exciting show to watch as you never knew what direction the skits would go in.
Tommy I remember when you & Chris were unknowns in The Schlitz Malt Liquor Tour..Liked both of you guys back then & LOVE❤ you now..👍
Ackin instigators ..
Just stop the old talk Will made  mistake and that is that stop playing black people, they have other issues that is more important.
Really? And someone who is little BUT has a BIG mouth can spew out as much ridicule and hurtful jokes as he wants ?? What hypocrisy ! WORDS HAVE POWER - and if you're going to resort to words to defend your real intentions or deliberately target someone to make them look small, you're not a stand up person - comic or otherwise. THINK before you speak just as much as we were all expecting Will Smith to THINK before he acted.
Pinkit said herself that once a year both her and will have a pass to cheat...so this is BS and tommy is just trying to promote his fake news book like everyone else
Tommy mad chill.  Good to see he’s doing well
do you know that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life? If you were to die this very second, do you know for sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you would go to Heaven?  Let me quickly share with you what the Holy Bible reads. It reads “for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” and “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The Bible also reads, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” And you’re a whosoever right? Of course you are; all of us are.  I’m going to say a quick prayer for you. Lord, bless my friends and their families with long and healthy lives. Jesus, make Yourself real to them and do a quick work in their heart. If they have not received Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, I pray they will do so now.  If you would like to receive the gift that God has for you today, say this after me with your heart and lips out loud.  “Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free. Jesus, thank You that You died for me. I believe that You died for me. I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You’re coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost, a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I’m saved; I’m born again, I’m forgiven and I’m on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen.”  if you said that prayer, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I tell you today all your sins are forgiven. Always remember to run to God and not from God because He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you said that prayer, LIKE THIS COMMENT. Jesus loves you and I love you too ❤️
If will and his wife don't want people discussing their personal business, they shouldn't put their business out via social media, talk shows or personal interviews. That's fact!
Who?
I find it ironic that he says the smack heard around the world when if you've listened to the video you will hear no slap sound just a lot of movement from the mic rubbing against clothing or something but there is no slapping sound which is disappointing editing really failed on this one
Smith Should have been Handcuffed and  Escorted Out of the Theatre.  Assault if a Criminal Offense.
Seems like it's a season for bullies right now.
https://youtu.be/jtNLr9yAS6Y
I wish Patrice O'Neal had been alive to see this. He'd have crawled up Will Smith's ass and stayed there for a year telling Jada jokes every day.🤣
The whole issue seems that Smith was trying to be a hero but decided to present himself like a fool - Yes he did have every right to defend his wife, but he was laughing at the choke until his wife gave him the side-eye, and he decided to be a hero. Yeah right  Will smith
His women cheated on him openly.  I would've applauded the joke not reacted like that. Would've dumped that baldy along time ago.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
FOX NEWS is so fucking racist 🤣😂🤣
I just came back from 25 years into the future and they are still talking about the slap.
M
Slap heard around the 🌎 😆
Why is she stirring things? Why are you talking to her?
she's trying to put T on the seen...witch...watch out T..
When Tommy made Woo (with Jada), Will was a skinny dude from the burbs. No chance he wanted to “go outside.”  Hell, he still slaps like a girl.  🤣  He needs to get back in front of the camera.  Tommy is FUNNY.
Only took him 1 minute to mention race
Think Will grew up fighting with ears like that.
I thought Joan Rivers passed away...
I love tommy he is Oscar proud proud snacks LOL
Tony rock is his brother   Host "mind blown"
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who (REPENT).    Just ask  (for the BLOOD of JESUS for FORGIVE your SINS).   And then PRAISE the Name of GOD!  And then ASK God for what you need help with.  It REALLY WORKS.
We all know that Willie's greatest desire is to be cast as a white man. It could happen.
I'm surprised will did that usually he likes when other men touch on his bitch
Jada running this dudes life on the set
Since 2pac he never recovered

When you put your business out there, you should be ready for strangers to critique your life. Do NOT get mad if you put it it there and you don't like the response.
“That’s when Will decided to get real”
Your ego is not your AMIGO. DN
He didn't become "Real Human" when August was smashing Jada!!!🤷🏿‍♂️🙄👌🏿👍🏿
This interviewer is really trying to help build up a lynch mob after Will! This woman is the Devil’s Advocate!She’s practically salivating over Every confrontation Will ever possibly had with anyone and everyone else, and not just with Chris! Will slapping Chris WAS wrong. But if Chris is gracious enough to take the high road, let’s allow these two men to work it out. It’s just a matter of time before Will is going to be reprimanded for his actions. Adding fuel to a smoldering fire is not necessary. 🙄
👊🤨Chris Rock is the man of the hour, he is a true Showman!!!! He is gonna come out on top of the whole thing an bring home the Bacon!!! Shoot bring home home all the Bacon that he can!!!!🙏🤣

The *Chris Rock* Special - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWdbKTdZ5JE
Imagine mocking a bald female for some laughs out of HOW many celebrities in the audience?!?! Right… Who even thinking about Jada at the Oscar’s? So why is Chris Rock coming at her? He came for smoke and got it. Get bitch slapped Chris Rock
Will.. we support you... nobody can insult your family... we as men have the responsibility to protect the family from any attack... Will you show that you are a great man
I remember watching a movie Strictly Business 1991 film. Tommy Davidson played in, also a movie called WOO! with Jada Pickett two of my favorite movies of the 90's era.
https://youtube.com/shorts/3NuWdfKZ54A?feature=share
I may be missing something.....so JPS had to have told WS about the kiss and that it bothered her, yes? She was a name--maybe no- names feel they can't speak up, but she was a name even back then, and could have handled it herself between her, TD, and the producers. What it's looking like, what is coming across, is she shows to WS she's upset, and he hops to it. I have to wonder how much of it is love of drama. Someday he may go up against someone not as classy as CR, and regret it.
Even Tommy wouldn't say anything bad about Jada. Will laughed at first. It wasn't until he seen Jada's side eye, that he went up there and did what he did.
Oscar Proud From The Proud FamilyJust Be Clout Chasin'
Can I just say story aside Tommy Davidson is funny as hell.  Always found him brilliantly talented.
This lady shouldn't do pop culture interviews. At the same time Tommy isn't explaining the story very well
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Damn, Will Smith bout to get checked by every OG in town
Tommy Davidson is a true comedian. Met him in NJ and he was a class act
The way Chris reacted and handled it in the moment is true showmanship.

We saw the Real Man behind the Avatar!
People are about to find out the kind of person Will really is. A bunch of celebs are about to go down.
Will Smith is lacking EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. He needs to work on himself. The action of hitting a person in an event like this says a lot about his/her persona. He laughs at the joke and then he reacts with violence? All Jada did was roll her eyes. She is not going through a deadly disease. It’s just hair loss. She knows she is beautiful with or without hair. She needs to learn to laugh and take things smoothly. She should have stopped Will if she really loved him to protect him from all that is going on right now.    OMG and the yelling, I felt so embarrassed for Will. He was acting so Ghetto. I guess no matter how far he has gotten, he has  gotten so low and unprofessional.   Two broken people, Jada and Will, need to back off the limelight, and just concentrate on healing, on themselves and family. Putting your whole life out there does not make things better. Media is not making their personal issues better. Media will make their whole personal issues worse. This is going to end badly. It will be too difficult to handle.    Will is breaking and he needs to heal. He is losing control and mixing his personal life with his extracurricular activities and work.   Chris Rock does not even have to do anything. Will Smith has done enough to destroy his image and career. Hitting someone because of words it’s not acceptable, no matter what. It was a stupid joke. It was expected in these events. If the media accepts and justifies this, it will end up in a domino effect.   If Jada was so hurt  and offended it would have been better, CLASSY  and an intelligent move if Will  and Jada together would have waited, and asked to speak with Rock after the event, and maybe Rock would have made a public apology to Jada and that was it. End of story.

imagine finding this comment
This is a hasty stance  If the announcer was the wrestler, The Rock  Does the actor dare to slap him?  Surely he was satisfied with admonishing  So why do we humans want to get our rights from the weak?  Knowing that the Al-Kamdi announcer was spontaneous  But his fault is that he is weak  Peace be upon the rock wrestler and every strong man wanted to be respected by fate  The strong is the one who is gentle and wise
GLAH GLAH BOOM 💥
Calling BS on "let's take it outside" being a de-escalation.  It isn't, and EVERY guy knows that.  Stepping outside is an acceptance of a physical fight.
ROSANNA S SO FINE. MAMA MIA.  1
He became real human???? Sure he did… without his meds will smith is a. Mess..
Look 👀 at the gas ⛽️ price no more war talk 😂 we  the people  😯 will smith is now the gangster he always wanted to be .tommy now on trending rock show now $400.  🤦‍♂️ smh
Now that he officially looks crazy... she'll divorce him. "I just need myyyyyy space."
"That wasn't a Black tour at all." 😂
I believe that this was a planned fake event....Hellywood is dead
i have seen guys do something like this in the heat of the moment when they think the need to look tuff... when we were 17yrs old! but Smith is 53. he got issues is all that i can say. needs to grow up. he really has become "Jaded" in these past many years.
People make mistakes.. I’m sure your all saints but ponder this.. Bullies like the one’s when you were young first picked on you by talking about your appearance then it may have or may not have led to physical violence.. we laugh at comedians but the truth is they can certainly be considered as bullies if viewed from a lens of picking on people in the front row at their shows to save their set or to just get the show started.. Just depends on your perspective no one goes to a comedy show to be the joke of the show just like no one goes in to work to be physically attacked but we are human and this may have gone different on a different day but that day events aligned to create chaos .. and I’m tired of all the sanctimonious Karen’s who are soooo judgmental, deeply affected , and out raged .. let’s be concerned for the parties involved.. what might will have been going through to make him do that and what is Chris going through to have it happen and then watch everyone who wax there or just sat in front of the tv to watch do an interview about how it made THEM feel.. you all should be ashamed
Will Smith did nothing wrong, I've would have done the Same thing
Underrated comedian.
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
Bully is always acceptable in USA...OMG IF He is very talented comedian ,stop use these kind if joke and  more creative. This situation is not about what she did ,nobody deserve bully. ,it's hurt people deep inside like get physical,Just because you can't see the wound doesn't mean you haven't been hurt. I don't even see the law protect people,students in USA about bully,so you have to protect yourself or act like everything ok with that disgusting people.(all the audience love bully joke too)Will protect his family....he is good husband no matter what the wife. Some people are funny that make you sad. Neither words nor facial expressions nor hurt. When it becomes anger, you retaliate, then you instantly become the villain. It's embarrassing to make money by bully other people on TV,nobody shut their mouth and  the audience  support their their bad ideas ,bad joke, the  actors are public figures? Don't forget, they are father, mother, and human like you. You guys weren't by their side on their hard days either. take a lot of clips of him to make money  ,not your  abilities like he did,or most people in USA  like to hear bad things, to see other people unhappy To feel better about your own life?(tixic?) Do you know encouragement ,positive and  more humanity joke? Jada is imperfection but she is lucky to have Will.   You wouldn't hold Oscar hand when you die, A family doesn't have to be perfect,it just need to be united.
Why does everyone think that Chris Rock's degrading joke is OK.
You insult my wife  - i slap you. You take it because you know what you did. ( then you go for a beer)  The good old days. ( it's fake anyways)
Love you, Tommy.
Humans!
Go Tommy.. he is such class!
Will Smith thinks he a big shot   but he proved he's a bully
Worst interviewer ever. Clueless. Just talking to hear herself.
Thanks for all the subs!
What a horrible interviewer
News organizations are really milking this
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Will, Jada, and Jaden need to go FAR AWAY..."Keep my wife's name out your effing mouth!" Well, what about the dude that had HER in his mouth? Will is a SIMP that picked on someone much smaller than him. That's a cowardly move. Jada doesn't want him and I see things going extremely wrong if he doesn't get help.
He surely has aged gracefully!! Remember when he was on Def Jam Comedy and when he played in ACE VENTURA!! He still handsome
Shit still funny regardless
Chatty patty 😒
How is Chris wouldn’t hurt a fly but had hit his ex-wife? Please
Much ado about nothing  Cheers
https://youtu.be/82ZYPmkgi1k
Chris Rock is a total class act. He deserves all the praise he is getting. He could have let the incident devolve into a mess. He could have thrown fists with Will Smith, he could have had Will Smith arrested and removed from the theater, which should have happened. Will Smith should not have been able to get up on stage and accept that Oscar, and get the ovation. Hollywood are a bunch of spineless worms for giving him an ovation after the bullshit he pulled. yes!

Think about how Jada felt— thanks Ihosomeone would speak up for
When Im presenting at the Oscars,im not looking out for chris rocks.. im looking out for will smiths
Will is due a Spiritual awakening.
I’ll be glad when black people stop seeking and caring about having validation from white people .. chris is a comic he’s free to say whatever but he knows the consequences as all comics do was chris wrong ? Not at all but was Will wrong for reacting to something he felt wasn’t right ? Not at all ! Y’all love telling people how they should feel .. these celebrities are regular MF’s with money .. stop being them on a pedestal  and you won’t be so hurt when they show they’re just a regular person .. but salute to tommy a true legend .. and salute to Will regardless of what “the academy” does or don’t do .. Will already resigned and who cares .. he already won and everybody knew years ago Will was a solid actor.. he never needed validation from these people anyway .. much love to chris as well .. but Idc what nobody says letting another man slap you national tv and you just stand there isn’t honorable Idc how you spin it .. nigga could’ve at least flinched at Will 😂 I mean damn .. and the fact people are respecting this kind of behavior is putting out a terrible message it is not ok to let somebody slap you , punch you or put they hand on you and you don’t react too it 🤦🏽‍♂️
Please! Everybody makes too many excuses for these obnoxious Hellaweirdos. "He was being human." Yeah, a human JACKASS.
It was probably an open secret in Hollywood that Will Smith was insecure about his wife. She's his Achilles heel. Makes me wonder why Chris Rock joked about her so often. That wasn't smart to do it in front of him. No one could predict that Will would slap him but Chris should have predicted that it would hurt him on his Oscar nomination night. I don't think Chris liked Will before the show. Doesn't excuse the slap but Chris is not entirely innocent either.
Will never see or spend my money on a neanderthal like will smith again.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Can’t wait to see Will’s career die.
Click Bait! Look at this Jewish Yenta bask in all her Anti-Black Racism. Media running to any and all Black talking heads to goat them into saying things they want to say but are afraid to say for fear of being called out as the Racist they truly are.  He said, he asked to take it outside, off of the bus, and this Yenta interjects the word "Street"" really?
Can people talk about the real culprit Will and Jada's relationship.
"So give me the relationship,  I'm not aware of this back story"  lol,  take a wild guess... I'll give you a hint,  his last name is "Rock"
Will Smith it kitty wipe. Jada Control’s that whole marriage.
So whatever happened to Covid?? Just disappeared?? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
the way Chris Rock handled it is very commendable 👏🏽 violence is never the answer!!
Will had a “next nigga to say something about my girl getting slapped” moment
CHRIS ROCK BROTHER TONY ROCK POP OFF AT WILL SMITH👀https://youtu.be/J46khTy_TcM
Janet Hubert had Will’s number all along and that is the person who she probably saw that he only showed off camera!!!
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.   (2 Timothy 2:8-9)
Does Smith get that angry at his wife’s lovers too?
Tommy starred in a movie called 'Woo' with Jada.
Need to keep comments within our community. Chris ain't even making this big of a deal. And none of u geniuses have figured it out yet?
“Not gonna talk about the smack heard around the world”  Him: then proceeds to talk for 3 minutes about the thing he said he wouldn’t
Lmfaooo Chris rock is not sweet. I know people who work in hospitality who say he’s the biggest asshole. Still don’t feel like he deserves a slap though.
I’m OVER it!
Can't take this interviewer
Will Smith is proof that "you can take a n_gga outta the hood, but you can't take the hood outta of a n_gga". And when is Will going to stop being Jada's b_tch?
Shaboing
She was definitely looking to set him up but he masterfully maneuvered.  Tommy is smart.
So he sexually harassed her and asked Will to go ”outside” and yet Will is the ”bully” huh? Bs
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Jada was NEVER a successful actress, now she is happy Will also will NEVER be successful again!  THUGS!   You can take the boys and girls out of the trailer park but you can't take the trailer park out of the boys/girl.
She don’t know Tony Rock🤣
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Willlll SMITH IS a disgusting Preck I hope he feels this FOR the rest of he’s LIFE!
who care bout WILLARD SMITH ? AGENT M DESERVED EVERY OSCAR ! HE COULD MOONWALK TOO !
Great Interview!
This interviewer sucks.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Chris was bullied and abuse his  whole childhood and teenage times, and  he one more tinme  was abused bullied and humilliated on live tv by that piece of 💩Will Smith! And the assaulter got claps on the back, high fives and  standing ovation. The best prove that the Hollywood elite is a bunch of  disgusting people who soul their souls  for fame &money. Will should be cancelled, the oscars shouldbe cancelled, and people should stop blindly idolize actors because of the characters they played ,down the fake  shinnig faces they are just awfull human beings!!
She's  trying to tear WILL DOWN !!
*_Love Mr. Davidson but I feel that it was a moment "where Will Smith showed who he really is". The image that he has presented to the public is a false image._*
It was a moment he became real human. Aka his “nature came out” dna colorman
“It was a moment he became real human” aka nature took over. Aka DNa. Aka Champ out.
Do everybody see how she is loving this.... Hilarious.... Fill in my blanks.
Fox News would interview someone on the other side of the country lol
I love me some, Tommy! 😍
I grew up with Tommy, just a great funny guy
> 'Chris Rock wouldn't hurt a flea.' > Chris Rock made a hurtful joke about Jada AGAIN, which is why Will hurt him  Comedians have a bizarrely warped idea of the power and effect of words. A thing can be humorous and hurtful, and the humor doesn't make it okay.
Will was wrong but it’s funny seeing all these black men speak out against em but they’re so quiet when they get treated like shit by white men. Don’t hear from any of them. Really interesting to me.
0.33 What was that reaction ?!
Will Smith knew the writing was on the wall, so he jumped before he was pushed. BUT since he's taken away punishment from the Academy, he will face another punishment from them, losing his Oscar for Best Actor and maybe a fine. Some say Will won't lose the Oscar as others in the past did not. The difference is these people that did NOT lose their Oscars were NOT criminals at the time they got their Oscar. Their past deeds were uncovered long after they won the Oscar. BUT WIll Smith did a criminal act the day and minutes BEFORE getting his Oscar in plain sight of the entire world. This Will Smith incident is a first and that is WHY he will lose the Oscar and that award will NOT be handed over to a runner up as its tainted by Will Smith's hands.
Please tell me hoe chris triggered it if will was laughing himself? It was because jada said 2pac wouldn’t of let nobody humiliate me like that and thats when the pressure bubble burst 😂
"A street kind of way!" No to get out of a closed environment. It's not street unless you're considered street. It would've been in a gentleman way if they were Caucasian.

Chris Rock beats Will Smiths ass in a back alley.
Tommy I loved how you indirectly answered the questions without putting too much out....If I did that I would probably not have issues at work... Classy!
The Academy should take back their Oscar!
Maybe the Rock can take over for Will on Bad Boys lol
Can will smith pick on uncle snoop or 50CENT ? Never he’s a btch

https://youtu.be/fPf8eUaY2jY
Will -  meltdown Chris is a class act.
It’s all coming out.
He's on Woo with Jada and he kissed her and Will gets upset.
These zombies gave him a standing ovation for slapping a man half his size over a joke. These people are demonic goblin crap,
Will Smith, his Wife & his Kids all come across as very full of themselves. They think are really hot-sh*t, despite being mediocre talents.... No wonder Will thinks he can smack Chris in front of millions of people and get away with it.
"He got scared"?  So, he smacked Chris because he was scared, Uhm NO😏
People keep trying to excuse Will Smith's behavior.  So what if he hadn't won an Oscar?  So what if Chris Rock made a benign joke about Jada?  Will did not "become human."  Will could not longer be considered a great actor because he could not even act like an evolved, healthy, human being.  The Adademy Awards began giving awards in celebrations like this in 1929 and no actor had ever behaved with violence at an Awards Show in all that time, until Will Smith.  He's a POS and I can't believe the audience there gave him a standing ovation, and allowed him to accept his Oscar on stage after his outburst.  What a bunch of woke hypocrites!
The only real human here is Chris Rock
Will Smith Real human 💯💯💯💯 Chris Rock was real insensitive
Thank You Tommy Emotions were high
The resignation means Will can't vote for himself anymore!   Nowhere near good enough!  Have his star at 6801 removed.   Damage it!
Tommy is a legend
Sink that F movie!!  NO to king richard!!  Money is all they understand.    Smith shat all over the Oscars.   Now Republicans can say Black Lives Don't Matter.   .. and even worse I've heard.   Hurt his career!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Tommy!
I remember reading Tony obviously wasnt happy about the slap incident. Also I have heard so many stories about Will getting angry and physical even when he doesnt really need to. 😂 But hey hes human with emotions and a lot of stuff going on too I suppose. 😭
Just wanted to mention to you all that Jada's side chick Will is adick.
Ok, well why provoke Will ?  Leave people alone I hate comedians pushing boundaries ❤️from Australia 🇦🇺
So it's a pattern. Hollywood has been covering up.
Hollywood money all cursed
Chris Rock is man of the year. Such professionalism can't be taught. My respect for him grows tenfold.
Tommy act like a female.
Oh Will you poor thing. That woman has him wrapped around her thumb. 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😉
Will should be screaming THANK YOU CHRIS for not having him hauled off by cops minutes after hitting him.  Two seconds after he smacked Rock, Will is SMILING and swaggering back to his seat, a cell video shows her laughing as Will sits down.  He thought he'd be a badass since Rock is a small bodied comedian, and smack him and thought it'd make people laugh, based on every action he took walking up and back, then when it hit him what he'd done, and he knew it was not being taken lightly, he balled!!!!  Sorry, you lost my respect forever.  Cheers to Chris for being calm and not attacking Will back.
When you brought the book out you should have said..."Bam"
We already know King Richard Williams called bullshit on Mr. Smith’s actions,
Chris Rock joke funny? Subjective (but the whole house was sure laughing including Will)  What did the slap did? Sales of Minoxidil, hair tonic, wigs and Chris Rock ticket skyrocketed   Is Green the colour of envy? Yes, indeed.
"class act" damn, ya'll can't give any more compliments? Lmao. He's a Great Guy. A real Stand Up guy.  No pun intended
Tommy Davidson is really funny and talented. Was one of my favorites when he had screen time on in living color. But I met him one day in the 90s, and he treated me rude. Real arrogant and kinda nasty.   I never forgot that
There can be one million people in a room, and 999,999 won't slap you , but one Will
Shout out to Tommy Davidson

(We are in the end of times) Acts 2:38 Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Pray and fast) Philippians 4:6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Joel 2:12 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”  (Turn to Jesus while there is still time.)   John 14:6-7 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.” John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. Luke 18:20 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” (Jesus loves you. He is The Only Way. God is real and He is Truth. The Bible prophecy is being fulfilled. God bless.)  Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Romans 10:17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. (Present Signs) 2 Timothy 3:1-5 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. Luke 21:10 -11Then He said "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come. (God's anger through weather) Pslams 18:7-8 The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.  Make disciples of ALL nations.Spread the gospel. Matthew 28:19-20  Questions, Prayer requests, Bible study or just to talk or get baptized. See my page. (Not gonna look at or reply to responses to this comment)
I think he was a lil drunk , if he's smart he'll say he was
The way Chris reacted and handled it in the moment is true showmanship. Didn’t skip a beat, cracked a joke and went right on with the presentation. I feel so horrible for him, that happened in front of the world and literally ALL his peers. And now this resulting media circus.
These news people are the fucking worst. Trying so desperately to conjure up problems for a living and to sensationalize it all. Report the fucking news or what people are feeling instead of spending your days trying to coax shit reactions out of people about shit topics.
Tommy Davison using Will as clout to promote that book
Tony said IT’S ON SITE
Exactly,everyone is f n with Chris...love love tommy...he's f n an actor...you act.....without a Dj like jazzy..to back me up.....
I see a trend here...Jada. Just sayin. 😆
https://youtu.be/S4-XIePeepg
i go hard look me up 🔥🔥
protect will
Sammy Davis for sure. Candy Man.  And blonde women. Little Sammy.
I love Tommy Davidson. I'd like to have done comedy with him. I got the jokes.
This all is theatre
Hey David...
Tommy Davidson was a drug addict for years. I understand that he is now in recovery.
Dang!! Tommy seems to have issues with EVERYBODY!
this was a real non story
I'm sick of them talking about will. Smith yall just like little  kids how many days yall been talking about will  Smith. now Tommy Davidson he been paid to say something  about his brother damn let this shit die.....!
Will must have a history of being a bully .. it’s caught up with him now
Very balanced opinion. God bless
How much  money  was Chris Rock  paid to bring will Smith down they doing will Smith  just like they did  Jessie Somllet  bill Cosby  in many more brothers  who fucking try to make it so just like they made will Smith  they can made will Smith  in they can break him. No weapon formed against Will Smith with prosper
Love this fuqn guy, wish he was in more stuff.
Dear precious one, please repeat after me with your whole heart, "Father God, I'm a sinner and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe in the Good News that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and that You resurrected Him from the dead in order to restore my relationship with You. Through my belief and faith in Jesus death, burial and resurrection, I am saved.  I want to trust Jesus as my Savior and follow Him as my Lord from this day forward. Please guide my life and help me do Your will, Your way through the Holy Spirit. This I pray in the powerful, loving and glorious name of Your Son, Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior. Amen!" 🙏  Dear friend, may Father God our Creator, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and The Holy Spirit bless you, lead you, guide you and keep you in His abundantly loving care now and for all eternity! Amen! 🙏
I'm not understanding how people find it so difficult to empathize with Smith. I don't believe he deserves to be excused for his misbehavior, but I struggle to see how no one honors their spouse like this. Clearly, chivalry is dead.  The bottom line is: Rock fuqt up and made a lame, hurtful joke without clearing it in advance -- because he was freestyling. Smith absolutely could've done much better to simply take it, as a joke, but if you observe his interactions with Jada, in that moment, it becomes clear that his tune changed, the instant when he registered her hurt and bemusement. He appeared perfectly prepared to laugh it off, until it became clear that Jada did not enjoy being the butt of the joke.  I obviously can't know whether/not Smith is truly a nice guy, but I don't think any less of him, for this human moment. And I certainly respect the hell out of Rock, for handling the entire kerfuffle as smoothly as possible.
How odd for a husband to feel he needs to get involved with another actor's interaction on stage (more than once) with his wife. Imagine a doctor's husband going into the hospital to beat up her coworker because he was rude to her during surgery. It didn't make Will look strong. It makes them look unprofessional, vulgar and thin-skinned and her unable to handle the pressure of being in show biz as a "dramatic for effect" family reality show.
Saw Tommy at that Va. Beach comedy club probably a decade ago. Had everyone rolling for an hour and a half...
I could tell you one thing I know for sure:  I'm NEVER going to watch "King Richard"   ... I was so interested in seeing it, but F*CK THAT!
Will walked away from Chris like....AND, WHO GONE CHECK ME BOO?   LOL...THE ACADEMY, THAT'S WHO.
Got nothing to do with what Chris said!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everything to do with his evil wife!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She even looks like a snake!!! He would be a better person if he left her!!!! She is TOXIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tommy does not age! He looks pretty much  like he did 30 damn years ago!
Smith should be banned from acting again
Hi, i wanna get reply...
When you have your wife say you don't satisfy her in bed. When you watch your wife sleep with a kid younger than your oldest son and gave the dude brag about it over the media...  ... You will try to compensate by any way possible, even if it's via self sabotage.  I give you Will Smith, the insecure Gemini man.
Will Smith could've winked at his wife and gave her a loving gentle kiss saying: It's alright sweety, it's just a friendly joke, you look gorgeous, at least to me. That's what a real loving gentleman would do.
Not a big Will S. Fan but I'm human. There they go again, using our own to bury our own! Crabs in a barrel,all for the $! Tommy u shld be ashamed with the rest of u bandwagon mf's! Ready to hit a nigga when he's dwn. Did He fuck up an ova react? Yes,true indeed! Takes a real man to admit his faults. He "apologized" basically to the world,an stepped down frn the Oscars. Seem's like the media smell blood! Now there ready to hog tie up will an skin him alive. WITH OUR OWN!!!. Stop acting like we all Neva love Will b4 this,ha? Bro was in charge (at that said time) let that sink in awhile. Black man in charge of the Oscars! Com on people,Let that man live..... For we all have made mistakes!
What a noodle of an interview chick " Ohhh Tony Rock as in Chris Rock ...
Will smith is DONE I don’t think he’s going to be making any movies soon
Chris is a class act.
Christopher smith smacked shit out william johnson rock
At the peak of Will's career, he still cannot make his wife happy. What else can this man do? He acted out of anger, frustration and fear. He lost his mind. After the shouting from his seat, all there left in him is trained acting skills. Will should not think that everything his wife is not happy about, he need to fix it. She is a grown woman. When two persons are in a relationship, if one party keeps blaming the other partner, and not taking the responsibility to take care of the needs of the other, the other party will never feel he or she has done enough to make the relationship work. Over time. both parties will grow resentment. Both will become toxic and hostile. They need to admit their marriage is not a match and move on with their separate lives. They really tried, but they just don't have the intelligence to see the path clearly. I wonder what kind of therapists they get help from for all this years? Clearly nothing they have tried helped. Seem to me, they live in lies and keep fooling themselves. The couple have made things too complicated for themselves. Face your own defeat and move on. You are not above your prime instincts and human nature. If you don't feel happy in your marriage, get a divorce. As simple as that.
Maybe the public persona of Will Smith is just a well crafted one and he is not the squeaky clean good natured dude we think he is.
Tommy was so funny on In Living Color
I knew it will is definitely a bully picking on skinny comedians he ain’t nothing but a punk
Tommy Davidson is a true comedian. Met him in NJ and he was a class act
Tommy: “I was on a Schmitz malt liquor tour” Reporter:”Ha ha ha,yea I remember that”. Me:😒
This b is racist
Be honest what does "This is not the Hood." Mean. Sounds like a racist trope.
Racist B
Will is corny for that Big Facts
No one is talking about that viper Jada and her part in this idiocy of Will Smith.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life1
Tommy  does the absolute best scooby doo impersonation.
It’s sad that these white reporters who have no idea what’s going on are trying to get reactions from these legendary black comedians. He said “We’ll iron it out” she asks “In a street kinda way” 🧐wtf is that supposed to mean? Smh this is sick
dude farting and shit in the background smfh
Jada belongs to the streets and Will needs a reality check 🤷🏿‍♂️
So Tommy Davidson (who hasn’t been a fixture in Hollywood since I was in high school) has an opinion on something. Amazing how people sprout up like mushrooms out of the ground when something crazy happens.
WILD WILD WEST
Fuc Chris... he was bullying the unvaccinated
Because it’s bs
Fox is weird, just it’s set up on a couch, to interview. And, loud, just outlandish. We don’t have Fox. Was it an entertainment show, or host show, opinion news, fake news, ET talk show. Almost British and Australian in style. Very upside down, not real journalism.
Smith is concerned about Tommy kissing his wife on a "professional" level, yet he lets her sleep with another guy for years...ok Will...
Smith wasn’t even that good in the movie. I don’t know what the hell other people were watching. Every one of smiths movies are piss poor in quality. He is talentless and he can’t even rap to save his own life. His children don’t respect him or the mother. It will be  interesting to see how the children become when they leave the home to be on their own.
Will Smith is a punk thug.
https://youtu.be/kLZUwloA2Wk
His actions on the academy night Was Not "Real Human".  He acted like a wild beast of prey.  No cover here.
I can't stand that lady
Chris was a professional. Will and Jada were not.
What's the common denominator in all of Will's problems? - JADA THE NARCISSIST!!!
What Chris said didn’t trigger Will Smith!  He was laughing, clapping and nodding his head!  His skanky wife triggered him!
Tommy !!! The funniest comedian on  in living colors , he did more then 1/4 of all the skits !!!
boring...
2:58 4:07

Chris actually said that hes a bit of a pacifist. He told a story about hitting a really bad bully in the face with his bookbag (with a brick inside) and almost killed him. and swore right then and there. Pretty honorable if you ask me. Meanwhile, Will is letting 20 year old rappers take his spot on the bed while he sleeps on the couch.
The problem is, Will has plenty of time and a million chances to refrain and was cocky arrogant and grand standing the entire time.  Things would have to be pretty bad at home to explode like that. Also, it’s hard to believe that he was under too much personal pressure when you consider the fact that he was laughing loud enough that you could hear him above everyone else. So clearly he was not immediately offended by the remark but rather I think it was Jada‘s look that made him feel the pressure to get up and do something about it or deal with the repercussions at home later.
Who cares.
I don’t like this lady
Jada is ratchet. She instigated it with her look. She has something on Will. He reacted like a servant boy. Very weird. I think hes gay and she controls him with that. BUT forget them who doesnt  love Tommy Davidson, hes a total level headed class act like CR!
Tommy, what a brilliant man.  I’ve missed him.
But August Aslina never got his face slapped off for going balls deep "ENTANGLEMENT" with jayda....Ill wait.
Kudos to Chris ! Let Smith fade away and go be the Prince of Scientology ! He and his husband, Jada !
Wooooooo.....was a good 🍿🍿 with Jada and Tommy
Still feel Tommy is one of the funniest 😂 comedic actors alive.
I’m sure there’s a TON of people out there who have been at the end of this narcissists bad behavior! Dude is such a shameless asshole!
Will Smith is a nutless wonder.
Calls him a bully and then proceeds to make loads of excuses for him.......
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Will Smith is not all that as an Actor fresh prince was probably The best. What Chris said wasn't Nasty at all. Everyone laughed. Where do they get of. He's going through menopause.
Chris Rock SUE Will Smith for 200 million!!!
I love Tommy Davidson.❤
The nation's attention should be focused on Madison Cawthorne's revelations about congressional conduct not this foolishness. Pure distraction.
And of course Jada was involved in that event too......imagine that
YES! You do deserve an oscar for sammy bro. No doubt
He is talking about exactly what he said he wouldn't do.😆😆😆 Americans were addicted to the internet folks, finally see that.😭😭😭😭
so was janet hubert right about him?
Will is a joke!
She was really digging for gold, was she???
Will Smith turns to a bully if things don't go his way.
it is utterly amazing to me how HARD that  bi*** tried to spin Davidson's encounter into a fight. and then MOCKED him when he disagreed with her.
"Chris Rock kept his head when everyone else was losing theirs" - said by the producer of the show, and that's mighty true. Mr Davidson here also seems a rational, articulate and friendly man, and just reading up on his early start in life broke my heart.
The story is Will is just getting so tired of all the other brothers in the entertainment industry coming up and asking him if they can hit that
More Will Smith's Victim's
Oh Tony Rock popped off 🤣 https://youtu.be/UT88Cp72btc 😂
Oh Tony Rock, Chris Rock ohhh.   So taken back. Like she didn’t have a clue LOL 🤦‍♂️
Chris Rock is not a member of the Black Gay Hollywood Mafia. Thus an eligible target of Will Smith's impotent rage. Very handy of Rock to be same height and weight as J.P.S. Smack!
On April 2, on People, Will Smith said he had applied to withdraw from the Academy as a member and would accept all sanctions and disciplinary measures after the act of slapping Chris Rock on the Oscar stage. 94th time. “My actions in slapping Chris Rock were unforgivable. The list of people I've hurt is long, including Chris Rock, his family and friends, my loved ones, and an entire global audience. I betrayed the trust of the Academy.”
Tommy has always bin my favorite since IN LIVING COLOR with the Wayne’s brothers . Love that show .
Will is an ANGRY 😡 MAN
Don't like the interviewer
How much does she get paid to not know shit about the person.
Why are these folks trying to play these black people against one another
The truth is this....Will is not ready for the power bestowed upon him. He allowed Chris to goat him into revealing the demon Chris always knew Will had. Chris is not innocent. Watch Chris Rock on the Davide Letterman show of 2017 talk about Will and Jada. "Damn you Will Smith". His covertness of this couple is clear and he knew exactly what he was doing. Very sad because their beef should have been resolved 6 years ago before it escalated into this debauchery at the Oscar awards. I'm not team Will or Chris. It is what it is. STUPID!!!
Alopecia!
Will Smith Slaps Chris Rock Parody https://youtu.be/GCfRjgv6fJoX
If it was me I woulda got arrested....but I guess that’s just bc of “my white privilege”....... Folks...smfh...Ur not woke, Ur just a joke! Way to go Academy for promoting and allowing violent psychos to ones in control, What great role models y’all are....but no one can fig out the unprecedented gang violence....Shame on all of you fake hypocrites! Btw I’m a 35 year old disabled veteran that lives in the projects on $800 dollars a month, while Mr Smith the violent actors suit or even tie almost certainly cost more that what I live on for an entire month! You all must be so very proud having given a standing ovation to someone who just committed felony assault....but I’ll just go back to my loser life with REAL problem and a REAL disability.....😞Shame on all of you!
Will is a 3rd degree simp
Sha boing boing...lol
Everyones shining night was tarnish forever by Will. He was the big man on campus that had been ridiculed because his wife publicly told him of her,"entanglement". Broken or not. And I do feel for him. But Violence towards someone that had nothing to do with your baggage is wrong. This was supposed to be the most diverse Oscars. But we will never remember it for the diversity. And all the black creators being celebrated. This doesn't fall under the fighting words doctrine, which is a federal law we have. This was abuse of power. Assault in the simplest of explanation. Will will never serve and ounce of jail. And now, Will has set a dangerous president for on stage entertainment. This is not the world I want to live in. When words, especially a joke invokes violence.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Will likes running up on short, skinny comedians.
it was a slap seen worse in a middle school fight lol, the world is full of sh!t like seriously
Will Smith is being overwhelmed with emotion and does not know how to control it.  He needs to understand why.  The place to start is in deep calm meditation, in order to study how thought memory feelings and emotion work, both good and evil, consciously but more importantly subconsciously,  As you do this it will train your subconscious emotional reaction to remain calm, and it will teach the mind how the body works.  At first you will be stunned and then you will be amazed.
Dam!!!  What the fu¢k is the bid deal about a man making another man get over it America.  I live in NYC Williamsburg by the Marcy projects one of the toughest neighborhoods in NYC,  and I see guys slapping guys every day, and much worse than a bitch slap in the face.  America loves trouble, static, fights they breathe and eat it.
Tommy D, one of the most underrated comics around.
She has to be the stupidest news anchor lady ever... Oh Tony Rock Like the crack Rock I smoke lol
Chris snd i go back to before anyone knew us. We were on the Schlitz Malt Liquor Tour together.   “I remember that”  No you don’t! Stop lying. He had to dig deep to remember that. You sure as shit don’t remember it. 🤣
Fox local behaving like Fox Trump channel.
THERE IS NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE. THIS IS JUST A BUNCH OF DISTRACTION WHILE FARMIN AND FOOD SHORTAGE IS INFRONT OF US. THE DEVIL IS USING AND PLAYING WITH THE MINDS OF AMERICANS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. NO DOUBT DOSCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE. HOWEVER YOU ALL SHOULD GO AND LOOK FOR THE FULLNESS OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST AND FIGHT THIS BATTLE THAT IS NOT OF WHO SLAP WHO OR FLESH AND BLOOD BUT FOR PRINCIPALITIES, EVIL, WICKNESS, GOVERNMENT IN HIGHEST PLACES. BLACK PEOPLE STUDY THE WORD and Come of Confused Manipulations. Period.
Seems there's a tread that Will only picks fights with smaller guys. Real tough guy
Fox has become to woke...libtards!   #peepeetape  #goldenshowers  #trump2024-99 #tuckersitswhilehepees  #teamclayton
Here we go 🙄
Funky Finger Productions!!!!
Damit Jada did it 👋🤚👏🙌 🤣😂
😳
Tommy Davidson, I watched your performances. I'm Mexican American and there's NOTHING SEXIER than RISING ABOVE.
If you wanna learn about rocks... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFhD5HeByM&ab_channel=PhysicsGirl
Tommy wanted to be outside, just in case it jumped off. That way he could be ready for the smoke , if it got to that point.
Thanks Tommy! Great interview!
*After listening to Paul Rodriguez* and his incident with Will, only movies Will will be producing from now on will be Tik Toks.
Hardly Will smacked the next lines SMH jokes out of him ...It was funny when you told the disapproving crowd Oh that was a light joke SMH in other words I could  of really been more disrespectful...Yes he took it like a man because his embarrassed ego and he was in front of millions just like he embarrassed Jada in front of millions ...Chris were from Do or Die Brooklyn  we know that joke could of sent him to the hospital
A pathetic, out of control, narcissist. If everyone else can keep it together for the history of the show, why can't Smith? But look at who is excusing him and why. That's the interesting aspect
Tommy, what's on your "moinde"?
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Iron him out like the laundry....did that mean he was gonna fold will
In Living Color was the show.  I wish they would bring back the re-runs.  Love Tommy especially when he does Sammy Davis Jr. 👍👍👍👍
Good guy. Down to earth
the Smiths endured tasteless tactless joke assaults in interviews prior to being seated about Jadas "entanglements" to which they gave strained laughs & let slide  ... then loud mouth chris thinks its "CLASSY" to break out on a roll like hes on "heehaw"  & takin potshots at women is kool .... then names a particular woman so the camera swivals to frame her for all the world to see. I feel sorry for her & her Children as well as her Husband for the disrespect they were enduring from the time they arrived. If the Academy had guidelines as to what is proper so that insensitive hit below the belt comedians could learn what is appropriate .. the entire episode could not have occurred.  I really think its a well designed publicity stunt but even if not ... why dress in soft royal looking velvet attire if a person is gonna act like a common ass and loudly gaffaw like one that  you could find in a common drunken dive bar.  im glad Will Smith taught him he should show more class & respect for Women than that.  Not that free speech isnt important but the Academy is to blame for it all ... some loud mouth comedians have no moral & ethical sense to know whats appropriate at what place .... it wasn' t at some drunken drug party where nobody cares and they will laugh at any stupid joke .... it was a formal Event broadcast on National television where many people from all walks of Life & Circumstance of various ages were possibly viewing. Who wants their Male Children to Disrespect Woman and think lowly of them then mock them or their Female Children to have a subconscious message implied to make them feel less than, ashamed and so bad that they deserve being mocked and disrespected by men. What person out here in the real world outside of the Hollywood bubble that has cancer or alopecia thinks its hilarious ????  Doesn't matter whether he knew Jadas medical condition ... if chris could see beyond his own nose ....he would have already knew the condition exists and the Event was being broadcast Nationally & perhaps beyond. NO everybody should not be feeling "oh poor pitiful chris r. but hes such a hero for not apoligizing for his provoking asshat not funny but insulting offensive, tactless humor to instead then go on with the show so that he could appear stoic and grand (NOT) !!!!   INSTEAD HE be a coward to let those he provoked take all the fallout ... then make $$$$$$$$$ as a result. YEAH HES A THIEF THAT STOLE THE SHOW IN MY THINKING !!!   AFTER THE SLAP .....HIS UPCOMING NEXT SHOW SOLD OUT IN HOURS, MAKING MORE THAN WHAT HE PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED IN MONTHS OF TIME AT HIS PREVIOUS SHOWS.  poor pitiful chris ...he was sooo wrooonged ... nah ...  i dont think thats what is reflected in his bank account now
The questions were low quality
He became a human...well said!
Well spoken Tommy I love you as an actor...You are one of the few people  who talked  about the Slap everyone else is doing the most like he punched him SMH I'm a fan from In living color day one ....Team Will sorry Chris need knows not to talk crap if he can't  fight we're from Do or Die Bedy Styv Brooklyn
Everytime Something happens ..Tommy Davidson had a run in with Them😑🙄😑
No excuses Tommy. Will Smith has a pattern of anger issues and extreme arrogance. He is a pos. Tommy has to be one of the most underrated comedians on the planet.
Ukraine is more important than a fight between three egos.
The academy awards is saying Clearly that it's OK for violence and that nobody is safe while they are there! Jada and will are two damn narcissists.  They are very disturbing couple!
TD ...funny guy ...smart too
I'm done with Will Smith. Will not see another one of his movies or show. POS in my book.
Will smith had misdirected anger, Jada has emasculated him with all her negative talk with all her negative talk regarding their marriage, he was laughing at the joke, Jada rolled her eye so  he had to be gangster for Jada so she can feel protective. G I Jane should have been a compliment.
Chris triggered it? naw he just paid for Will snapping at Jadas reaction. Get help Will! maybe take a break from toxic folk? and some accountability! like the rest of us.
thanks to Will, I will always remember the very mild / ok g.i. jane joke forever which I would've forgotten the moment chris said  it. Thanks Will. 😣😣😣
This women is toxic. why not? why not? like damn get over this shit people.
It's shameful how Black people hate to discuss any history related to our enslavement but yet we still repeat the same patterns. Any historian can tell you how the physically dominant slave has always taken his/her aggression out on the weaker one opposed to his real oppressors.
Tommy said we can go outside🤣🤣🤣
As, I watched, Will Smith Slapped Taste of Chris Rock on Repeat, since March 27, 2022, at 11:30 PM EST Uncensored, different percentage % of me asking who the Slapped Intended is for. As you watch the YouTube and Australian Version and not The TMZ United States Version, Will Smith have started laughing originally followed my moments later going Charlie Murphy to Rick James. No, this is not staged at all. Perhaps Chris Rock is not aware Jada Pickett having Alopecia. However, Chris being one of the greatest Comedians per Stand Up; you have numerous materials to speak about. The $500.00 Gas Prices or Jussie Smollett comparing himself to Emmett Til or you could had taken another direction and gave props of Booker in tears with Supreme Judge Jackson. Have anybody talk to Demi Moore. GI Jane reference not funny, but not offensive either. Now Will Smith speaking of a different direction. You could just have confronted Chris Rock behind the scenes or party or commercial break. Jada embarrassed you with y'all open entangled marriage and threw Augustine per your marriage break or Jada keep bringing up her friends with benefits with Tupac. Will you have laughed about Tiffany Haddish and Sanna Lathan both cutting their hair bald. Seem like Will, you took your frustration out on Jada Embarrassing you out on Chris Rock. This would been a great punch, if you had won the Oscar for Ali in which you should had or Pursuit of Happiness or Collateral Beauty. No issue with you defending Jada, yet now the stereotype of angry black man LIVE on National TV and produced by Black Production, Will Packer. You did not defend Jada at all; just attempting to prove to millions you are not soft and weak, yet show you are sensitive and abusive. You give out jokes, yet do not take a joke. On commercial break or behind the scenes you could had talk to Chris Rock and told or warn him. This would been a great episode of 🎶 Everyone Hates Chris 🎶 - An Iron Jaw! Makes you wonder how far Martin Lawrence gave out jokes towards Will Smith in Bad Boys Series behind scenes and not on Camera. Someone needs to apologize to Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. Someone needs to apologize to Will Packard per first black person to produce the Oscars. Watch "Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb" on YouTube https://lnkd.in/dbUYJusx
Willard has exposed himself the whole nice cool guy was facade he destroyed that night showing his true weak self . He overshadowed the whole event of beautiful achievements by women and men who had far more phenomenal performances. He is indeed a better actor than we all thought to maintain his act for so long. He was the devil that crept in at the moment when black excellence was happening he ruined it and rather than it be remembered as historic it's not infamous.
The fact that u people think this is real and not a pr stunt amongst two big actors just shows how gullible Americans are
30+ year career … ain’t heard not one negative thing about the man and these stories are gonna start coming out of the woodworks… it’s sad people will use this opportunity for a moment. Man, whew it’s almost harder on him for being so squeaky clean prior to this.
So... Will Smith . . you can allegedly smack a man smaller than you for a GI Jane joke and poorly portray a tough guy  but not check any of those women who basically called her a whore and you the biggest simp ever when they joked about your marriage and seemingly pissed on your manhood in front of millions of people on the biggest night of your life?
Who cares what the academy does. The Oscar is a representation of a black man named Oscar micheaux. I wish they would just quit asking everybody in the world about Will Smith. Damn!!! You made the money off the s*** and now just let it go you don't have to dig up 20-30 years on the man to find some more s** to go with it. Fucc
I hate the academy awards
Tommy was so awesome on In Living Color
The only time this News channel FOX smiles at a black person is when they want shit on another black person, the enthusiasm to bring a black star to the ground shown by the presenter is quite pathetic.  I think Tommy Davidson is not biting as much as she hoped for him to bite,  because he too like Chris Rock is a gentleman.
She doesn't know who Tony Rock is because his ass is irrelevant. 😒 Always has been. Seems he's always tried to ride Chris' coattails. He's gotten temporarily bumped to slightly more popular past couple days thanks to the slap, especially since he released a so-called statement about it. His name will die down again in about 2 months. Lol.
Will was embarrassed on his big night and lost it.
😅🤣😂 love u tommy.
Probably should have slapped you on Principal. Just drop it and leave Smith alone.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Will thinks acting is going to take him safety through life. He things acting will save him from everything.
Will Smith is sick  beyond crazy, nothing but coward  bully, come in my neighborhood I'll show you what a real slapped feel like Tell Jada my wig will fit her head perfectly.
It's a war going on the Will Smith and Chris rock crap is over there is a war going on Ukraine and Russia
Will's god complex didn't last too long did it ?
Good Day has gotten messy! I’ve been out of NY over 20 years, but…
What does that even mean?? Will Smith pr team came up with this nonsense. If he was really sorry he would of left the Oscars when he was asked too. Look at the way he partied afterwards, he’s not one bit truly sorry. Again you’d think Smith and his wife knowing Chris Rock for over 30 years would of given him the benefit of the doubt that he didn’t know what Jada was going through and would of just spoken to him later about it. The sense of entitlement and that he’s above the law is sickening.
Will Smith thinks he's a man because he stepped to a guy half his size. It actually makes him less of one.
i love him
She tryin Tommy 😆
So many writing off WS as done. But, many times your greatest comeback comes from your greatest fall.  The bible says he who is without sin cast the first stone...I don't know anyone who is without sin except God.  WS may you learn from your mistake and be humbled by it...many great men rose from the ashes of defeat to experience their greatest victory. CR is a wise Black man who knows another Black mans struggles. Somehow in all of this mess CR gets it. God speed to both of these accomplished brothers from another African American sistah supporting you.
the back story....  Duh!!!
This is getting extreme. This should be over said and done with.
I can't stand people like her. You can tell even off camera she gets off on talking bout everybody's business!
Who? Who had a ruin in? Who is he?
You  guys  need  to  cut  it out. These people  is loving  it. Namely  white  people  you  really  need  to  let it go.
Paul rodriguez has been talking about his negative experience with Will Smith since 2016. They interview him again on the subject on inside edition
Will smith only went at chris rock cus he know he wasn't gna do nothing!!! Bullshit!!! He really wanna hit jada!!!
He doesn't know anything about anything he just rambling about nothing
Did ya miss me?! Varnell on Martin show..funniest skit ever😂 love you Tommy
Career suicide come on folks it's planned not for Chris
🤣🤣🤣 She ain't know who Tony Rock was!
Nothing triggered Will excerpt his arrogance and insecurity, trying to have the love of a woman who does not love him.
Will smith is a coward!!!
If Conor McGregor had been the presenter, and had cracked that GI Jane joke, would Will Smith have slapped him? No chance. Smith has a history of smacking people (he was once jailed for assault, and he has punched several reporters), but strangely enough they were all smaller than him. Will Smith is an arrogant, obnoxious, self-entitled pr**k.
PEOPLE ARE THEIR FOR THEIR AWARDS AND OSCARS, NOT SEE A VIOLENT SHOW!!! WILL WAS IN THE WRONG, BIG TIME!!! THAT IS ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR!!
My Goodness Ms Scotto is the dead ringer for Judge Jeannine
sounds like will is a little bit of a punk
GI Jada
Tommy and all the rest of you Black people entertainers should shut this down you dont have to speak about the incident. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THESE PEOPLE WANT DIVISION WHY NOT STAND BY HIM... ALL OF YOU ARE HATERS DOGS
She being so goofy smh
Smith should be ban for all awards  He was wrong putting his hand on a grow man face
Wtf? Jada instigated the whole thing! No snap.....she sent her dog out.....no snap....
Why is he even talking to FOX she has no clue. They want to fan the flames but sell your book Boo.
YES.   TONY ROCK IS C. ROCK'S SIBL...... THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.    😇😎🎤.
They are Digging HARD to make Will look worse!  Smh
Will Smith gradually getting exposed as having all the self control and maturity of a 14 year old.
Good luck to you Chris. Good to see you Tommy. I enjoyed the video.
Tommy is a master, wow, what an amazing talent, love this guy and have since In Living Color!!
Surviving Will Smith in 3,2,1.....
❤️him✨
What's up with the fart noises?
Jim Carrey has by far the best analysis of Will Smith's situation and disposition. They just want to be in anything and in everything, never get satisfied and always wanting more. He does not realize he is exceeding the bandwidth and he cracks before the public's eye.
Media kills me instigating “whyyy? Why aren’t you going to talk about it” Like damn, maybe ppl want to move on and not focus on bs. They love this and it’s sick🤷🏾‍♂️
"No one really knows what happened, you know"....YES, we do. An internationally recognized cuckold, with years of resentment stored up, was howling with laughter at the joke when he looked over at disapproving Jada...Then went straight into cuck mode and hit someone twice his size for the the lamest of jokes. You can't sit there for years and watch your wife getting shagged by other dudes without all that humiliation and resentment boiling over some day.
Tommy's trying to keep out of the mess!
No body cares.  Get a flippin life.  Foolishness is just a distraction to what is really important.  comedians are DUMB
Tommy Davidson is hilarious
Will forgot to check with his wife, before laughing at a joke.
Guess that’s not Jeanine Pirro
Dang I miss Tommy Davidson!!!! When I was 6 years old in the 90s I had the biggest crush on him.
Guess that’s not Jeanine Porto.
omg omg will smith chris rock omg omg so important
April's fool award: April Fool's day is like a huge open mic night. Millions of people saw will demonstrate how unfunny he was. Will call Sadhguru for a house call intervention of intense inner "re-engineering." He can save a power cord from a broken appliance.
Turns out Will Smith isn't such a great person.
Sell all DIS stock today. Semper Fi!!
I love her accent!!
Imagine if she listened to what he was saying and not just waiting for her turn to talk and ask all her pre-written questions like an NPC.
She is fake as hell, she don't remember the malt liquor tour.
tommay is full of cap. will smith would have knocked his head off
Tommy's a Legend.
Last name is rock  .. I don’t know the backstory 🤔
It's Varnell Hill 🤣🤣🤣
so I hear you can have sex with his wife but not make a joke? hmm LOL
My wife and I went ro see Tommy Davidson at a comedy show in Arlington Texas and he was so damn funny.   He also talked to us after the show and rook pictures with both of us. He had an interesting life growing up. Loved him on Living Color and he is a very bright man. He's real too!
The K*** has spoken.
Funny thing is years ago, Chris Rock was a special guest on the fresh prince
When I saw the look in ILL Smith’s eye I saw nothing but Evil Spirits. His deity must be proud.  That man is lost.
Rumors have been around for years that Will isn't a great guy, like Ellen.  Guess those rumors were true.  We all saw it.
'My spouse beat me up because he had a lot on his mind, it was a "human" response'
Another ridiculous excuse for a shameless, insecure, assaulter
Probably got batch slap to
WOW ... how clueless is this lady. The back story is that Tony Rock is Chris Rock brother.
Tommy Davidson I love you so much💕💖💕💖 You are so funny❤❤❤
August  Alsina was living in the same house as his wife and him. I wonder why he did not slap the guy that was banging  his wife.
Will career is over. No one’s going to support that bs he got away with. Just disgusting. Chris Rock is a legend and bravo brother you handled that with such class.
Tommy is not funny at all
Will Smith is a rageaholic.
I wonder if he bullied Carlton
As each day goes by, it keeps getting worse for Will, and I love it
I don't believe what Chris said triggered Will. I believe Jada did.
Will Smith is mean and needs  counseling!!
Luv how he spills the tea!
Tommy - class act :)
You guys like watching celebrities, I like watching what the sheep say baaahahahahhh
#ArrestWillSmith
That's why Will hit Chris, be cause Will is a bully and knew Chris wouldn't  slap Will back, some day Will will get punched in the face and then Will will be hum boult, and will not hit, well , slap like a bitch and be a man and not a boy.
He didn’t look scared please stop defending the insane guy .. he needs to be in prison now
Will would've whipped his ass.
People talk bout Chris Rock like he's a little bitch.
her:  what's the back story on tony rock? him:  um, that's his brother..... her:  (whispering) oh, tony ROCK....ohhh
There seemed to be many stories, that the public hasn't heard of Will be having in an outrageous way behind Jada! More to revealed. They say where thete's smoke, there's fire. So been going around handling people except August. Oh, he's a bully! Jada has done it ruin that man career.
Seems like there was never any trust lol! Why be with someone who doesn't love you!?
Book ANOTHER. SET UP
This reporter should've done a better job with her research.
This was an act.  Will Smith was more scared of his wife than the backlash, thats why he sacrificed Chris Rock.
Did you see that? He shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes. He didn’t believe that.
Tommy don’t fall for these interviews with people trying to get the dirt.Stay out of it as best you can and live your life.
Will tells Chris to keep his wife's name out of his mouth but Will has no problem with another man in his wife's mouth.
Tommy our love to you! You are an icon to praise and respect.
Listen to this guy. There are mobsters caught on secret recordings that sound more articulate than this dummy... AND HE'S ON TV.  Yeah, "we" (The West) are descending quicker than I would've imagined.
Irrelevant
This guy Has been exhibiting this kind of behavior towards people for many years and this time he got caught. Bye bye.
Will had a run in with Paul Garcia the comedian. Will is turning out to be like a psycho.
I don't understand why everyone has to pile on for. Ok. He screwed up. Destroy him now?
Again, a Black woman being disrespected, and her feelings disregarded. Why are people so dismissive of this.
No one knows what really happened if you're blind and deaf....What happened is that he married a monster.
Will Smith is just trash. In the real world people get cut or shot.
I saw tommy Davidson perform at the comedy store back in the early 80s. Tommy was great! Will Smith is just a thug in a tuxedo. Ban Will Smith from Hollywood. Once a thug always a thug. Don’t invite thugs to Hollywood events from now on.
WILL, WELL DONE. WELL DONE
Will smith uses anger and rage to dominate, destroy and belittle other men.
Great now he still needs to give back the oscar, and still needs to be arrested.
He slapped you to brah??
Chris Rock was bullied when he was young. Whereas Will grew up in a violent home. This is that very dynamic that was witnessed here!!! What Will did is UNFORGIVEABLE!!! I hope Will Smith meets his match because BULLY's will continue to bully until there are REAL CONSEQUENCES for ASSAULTING someone! Will resigning is just his way of trying to control things again. Quitting before he's canned. The Smith's are an extremely dysfunctional family and Will was given a standing ovation at the Oscars AFTER he assaulted Chris. Is the world really this SICK?! Regardless, Will got away with it, and that is DISGUSTING!!!!!
It's official!! Will Smith is crazy!! And no one truly knew who this man really was!  A NARCISSIST NUTCASE!! #Cancel The SMITH FAMILY!!
Hes a bully, he needs to see a shrink too
Hypocritical white America is pretending to be so concerned about one Blackman slapping another Blackman. They're NOT concerned at all. This all is a perfect opportunity for them to legitimately go after the Black will Smith. They're not fooling us.
I see Another successful black man being systematically sacrificed. It was a real $lap but it was $taged to foster division and provide a distraction from the real news, the central banking system falling, the fiat dollar being replaced, the coming food shortages, Hollywood ending, the Biden crime family being exposed, the Clinton crime family being exposed and military tribunals of your favorite politicians, actors, judges and global leaders.
Its Varnell Hill ! Did you Miss me ?
Hmmm, this is the 2nd person I saw in YT lately say something about the character of Will Smith. It's now coming out one by one -:the picture of his true color.
Will not be  excusable and accepted.
I met Tommy in Tower Records Los Angeles back in the 90's. I was undercover security. He took a picture with me and signed our celebrity wall. He was so gracious and friendly. In Living color was huge at that time.
Stop this cancel culture bullshit he's never done anything wrong his whole career.
Shame on you lady! For asking this guy if he's going to make jokes about that outrageous act on will smith on Mr.Rock. I hope that the public start to hold  their behavior  to standards  of more decency and not add insult to injury on an injured party. The people make actors and comedians rich. Such behavior shouldn't be acceptable and they should be held accountable. Regular people are. Boycotting on such people should be used to show them that injury to loved   decent actors and comedian
He looks good!
Gay
What triggered it, wasJada’s eyes rolling. Will was laughing along with everyone else until it cut to her… then all hell broke loose
https://youtu.be/5DavUkWfR7U
Kissing someone like that is sexual assault
This bozo didn’t even know who Tony Rock was.
He's always been a bully. Philadelphia back in the day.. go look
The smack was done by someone who has a lot of privilege. Rich and famous privilege.
Will let his wife start doing that stupid Round Table it made him look like a fool about her sleeping with other men that destroyed this man keep your secrets to yourself
I dont like what Will did either but I also being human know that he needs forgiven like  all of us.
Is that judge Jeanine? From Fox news? Her sister? A doppelganger? Does fox just make anchors like orcs?
Hollywood is full of narcissistic people and drags of humanity.  Hollywood is full of bogans with money. The whole artistic environment hides a cesspool of slim and shit. There is no honesty no loyalty and no sense.  These people will sell their children to achieve their agenda..
Tommy Davidson is a funny comic himself.
Will Smith sounds like a hothead. He needs to check himself in to a mental case institute or stress clinic as Hollywood calls it. He should be thankful he’s not in jail (where he should be)
Not iron it out lol 😂
no one knows what really happened?!?! what?!?!  Let's spell it out ... WILL SMITH ASSAULTED CHRIS ROCK
Will Smith is tired of public embarrassment/Humiliation/Disrespect. Sometimes the lil things will send you over the edge...or a lil woman :)
O yea they were in that one movie forgot about that movie
As a precaution against a repeat of this years Oscars incident, Iron Mike and The Rock are going to co-host next years event...
God Bless Tommy and all comedians across the world 🌎 that make us all laugh 😂
This dude's a coward. Why play apologist for Will Smith????? Weigh in for chrissakes. If you've got nothing to say don't take the gig.

Will will be back stronger than ever. 💪🏾
Will Smith acted disgustingly ... very unprofessional and totally out of context ... no wonder I don't follow these so called celebs ... no class
"Give me the back story" like she didn't know Tony was Chris brother his name his "TONY ROCK" GTFOH
Chris is a much bigger man than that putty whipped guy.
Smith has so many years of pressure, and he cracked. He's human, but assault is never the answer. You could talk to Chris, take it to him privately, not assault a comedian, and the assault ended up being an assault on the Academy and other actors wanting recognition and not wanting to witness such violence. It's like an actors' temple, and he profaned it. I am not a big fan of the Oscars, but Hollywood gave him opportunities and he shit all over them with that behavior. He wasn't thinking, of course, but you're expected to do so if you're in your 50s. He wasn't 17 or 25. I wish him well and to rehabilitate his career. I am sure if he could take it back, he would.
jeanine pirro's voice reminds me of 60 grit sandpaper.
Nut Jesus deserves praise only
You people are ridiculous!  I wonder how much garbage we can dig up on you!
This guy is one of the funniest to me. He’s awesome.
Another yes nigga tommy Davis
I wonder if anyone will take a poke at Will Smith after this?  Like, " You want to hit someone able to hit you back in kind???" 🤔.  Everyone talks about comedians now having to worry about Will Smith wannabees, but Will Smith might need to worry about  Chris Rock defenders.
The slap...before that happened, 10 other things happened. Check your house Brother.💯
Tommy is a damn legend.
THIS MAN HAS NOT AGED
Chris   Rock the world…
Here's the full video. https://youtu.be/8T5Q1yth5Bs
Even OJ Simpson knows Will Smith was 100% wrong.
who keeps making the fart noise?
pressure balloon?
Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money 💯
Tommy Davidson and David Alan Grier are underrated AF. Two funny ass dudes.
But Will didn't have that smoke for the young man who was smashing his wife. Tho
Jada was the instigator! Made Will look like a spineless coward! Will had to protect his wife from a joke he laughed at? B*tch Please! Move On!
Paul Rodriguez says that Will was a bully in “Ali”. Apparently he’s another Ellen.
Jada has always struck me as a professional victim, always blaming someone for anything not going her way.  She even found a way to blame Will for her affair with their son's friend.  Right to his face and in front of the world.  It doesn't surprise me one bit that she offends so easily and cannot take a joke.  It's almost as if she sics him on people.  Like he's programmed.  I think she is a toxic narcissist.  And here's a word I've never used against any woman in my life . . . c***.
Met Tommy in Pittsburgh, such a sweet man. Also met Tony, they are both HILARIOUS. Left the improv in tears.
I don't know who this woman interviewing is, but she is very annoying!
A complete bih . Looking for drama . The state of American news.
creamed corn!!!
Chris has always been classy!Will not so much!The people defending Will y'all should be ashamed!There was nothing to defend her life wasn't in danger just her ego which isn't worth much if she can't take a little joke clearly!
Media refuses to say assault. I wonder why?
Soon it’s gonna be like: “Will smith breathes after slapping Chris rock?! NO WAY!”
Everybody Hates Chris Nobody Cares About Tony
Not gonna lie, somebody probably should've been beat up in that story Tommy told where he kissed Jada without her permission. That's just not an ok thing to happen.
Always liked Tommy.
The host HAS A VOICE just like Judge Judy.
all you actors! don't you kiss my wife! only her boy toys can do that! hey will come smack me chump
Will thinks he is Ali now….nevertheless he acted wrongfully
Did you protect your face?
Chris Rock is trash for his victim mentality after trashy jokes about a medical condition.  Respect for Smith not tolerating Rocks garbage.
I think she played him once again to sooth her narcissistic ego. What Chris Rock did was a compliment. Demi Moore as G.I. Jane was beautiful and a badass. Jada should be so lucky if someone offered her to play a part in a remake. She is "cancelled"
Will was transposing his anger.  1.  I don't believe Jada has alopecia.  2.  She made herself the center of attention by using her front yard as a dress, literally Will couldn't even sit next to her so if she didn't want attention she sure had a funny way of showing it.  3.  She shaved her head for the event, if she was that bothered she would have worn a wig or a wrap.  4.  She's been to the Oscars before, they both know it's always hosted by comedians, and they still chose to sit in the front row.  Comedians engage the audience, that is their job.  5.  IT WASN'T EVEN AN INSULT!!!   My hair fell out because of my chemo (I'm currently battling cancer) and if someone called me GI Jane my first instinct would be to take it as a compliment which brings me onto my 6th point, Jada has always been that kind of person who LOOKS FOR REASONS TO BE OFFENDED.  So she can listen to herself say something she thinks is profound.  7.  Will (like I stated in the beginning) was transposing his anger.  Will genuinely laughed, he took the joke like everyone else did as a compliment.  Wasn't until Jada rolled her eyes when he looked at her that this jumped off.  It must be rough having a wife who has a boyfriend half her and her husbands age.  Will was trying to prove something, it really had NOTHING to do with Chris at all.
How to ruin a career in 30 seconds,  good job will
Great responses Tommy! I respect you for not feeding into the frenzy.
So Tommy says will a punk as long as ur smaller than him Jada a bitch period weather's she having hers or not and wills scared of her boyfriend who must be bigger than will in at least 2 ways
I love Tommy Davidson!! Chris Rock has a lovely friend in him.
Smith is a fairly big guy...he smacked one of the smaller guys in show business...that's chickenshit...!!  $100.00 says he would not have done that to Dwayne Johnson or Jason Momoa....Will is a bully and a punk !!!!  Chris Rock is the hero here..!!
Tommy hilarious dog impression at Bananas NJ
Where has Tommy been???? We need new content from him
The business like manner in which Will walked off after slapping Chris, *chef's kiss*.
In my opinion Will did the right thing. Rock didn’t in my opinion he should have hit back . As kids 99% of us are taught if someone hits u hit them back. They should have had their little scuffle and talked it out as men and moved on. A man should always do his best to back his wife and vice versa. A person has the right to protect themselves. If they would have fought like men and talked it out and made a post together after like most of y’all families members do after a reunion or y’all boys do after bar night the public would have been forced to move on  . Should have just been a man Chris like u almost did I saw that hand draw back then u thought about your white zaddy lol . Smh move on America . We fight all the times most of y’all every other weekend we see a damn slap especially anyone under 35 . Reality please stand up
This man smith is narcissistic
Vote democrats out nationwide in the midterms
These people in the media are so evil...I really dislike her energy....I get bad vibes from her...
Damn shame Wills entire career and imagine is being flushed down the toilet because of his toxic wife. Smh shame.
They are piling it on Will. He apologized. He resigned from the Academy. What else will make y’all happy. You want him to pay more consequences than the Jan 6 mob obviously.
Fox News is messy
What kind of man tells another man he's a sweet and loving guy??
A movie about an absolute myth of mine... Sammy Davis Jr.!??? A movie about him and Tommy Davidson, whom I admit I didn't know {I probably saw him doing some stuff but his name never came ty ear... I live in Italy after all} before of this video, is the actor who's gonna give Sammy new life in the movie!??? Oh I just can't wait... I do see the similarities, something in the look... I just can't wait to see it... oh man... Dean "The Voice" {Sorry Mr Sinatra!!!} Martin, Jerry "My Life Saviour" Lewis and Sammy "The Coolest Of Them All" Davis jr.... I grew up with those guys... oh man oh man ohhhh man!!!
Two losers cross paths, more at 11.
Maybe Will acts that way with men and Jada because he knows that if there’s a dick in the room, she might jump on it.
Jada has been in the center of will’s L’s since day one .
Watch the video of Jada while Will is screaming.Jada doesn't even glance his way.She has eyes on Rock.She wasn't shocked at Will at all.She has seen this side before.
Tommy Davidson is a National treasure.
THE #ME2 WILL SMITH EDITION IS COMING LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Oh wow iron the laundry
Reminded Mr of this video https://youtu.be/8T5Q1yth5Bs
Who is this drunk azz lady lol lol lol?  😅😓😂🤣
Distraction people...how about Putin said gold for oil fools....they got y'all sheep sleep.
Tommy Davidson is the jam
Oh....PS ... and WS says his father had a temper, beat his mom. Was a strict disciplinarian who would punish poor behavior. So he's kind to Jada,his Momma, his kids & not kind to many others. I didn't say all.
https://youtu.be/44FJi6CK2OU
Lies, will ain't no bully, y'all fulla shit
He’s 100 💯% correct!
lol go girl, you know your stuff. Love it.
Will Smith thinks hes a real life tough guy.
U only pull a move like that if ur scared 😳! Other than that it was a bitch move!
The academy isn’t going to do shit
Tommy, he should have knocked you out cold as well.  You just another snake in the grass doing shit like that and you know it, no need to defend yourself.
Wil smith needs help with he's relationship and ego.  He looks tired of being publicly cheated by this Jada girl
Who is this woman? She looks like Marlow Thomas.
Worse Interviewer I've ever seen
Funny how tommy Davidson supposedly wanted to fight will after kissing his wife, yet claims jaimee foxx "bullied" him for years on in living color... smh everyone clout chasing. Why wasnt THIS in his book? Hmm
Per Variety- Smith has resigned from the Academy... was that to be welcomed to Grammys on Sunday??? Yeah was plucked for verbal assult, will should be plucked for his PHYSICAL assult and in the end Chris Rock owns the Academy for not having security around him.
I can definitely see Will Smirh as a bully. Why is that he gets beat down my his wife that couldn't weigh more than 90lbs. That why I know Chris could have handled that spineless tree.
Bill Cosby got away with fooling people fjr years . Will Smith just openly displayed he is an unwell psychopath
There's a crack in the PR/ Publicity dam of Will Smith. Stand back, it's coming. His well crafted,  public image is about to go down the river. Fellow actors from film to TV, big names & small will be spilling the beans. With his movie Ali, a well  known character actor, Paul R. older now & he's been around for yrs. had a small role in the film. He has stated WS is erratic, a bully, cruel, and a racist towards Hispanics.😮 An older comedian that was on TV, Living Color,  Tommy D. has had a few confrontations with WS. one was on a movie set that Jada was also on. I think WS ego is huge! He & Jada are both major narcissists. Just do a little research. I was surprised how many other actors etc.had a hateful, aggressive encounter with WS.🤔
Hi Tommy 😍
Tommy has been telling this story for years he’s another one who can’t get past
Will Smith should be more concerned about Jada sleeping with the 27-year old stud than Tommy Davidson kissing her.
I didn’t like how she tried to push him to say things
Tommy Davidson, one of my favs comedians In Living Color. "ding, pick it up'!
I don't like this guy
Wow
Drugs, Mr. Smith wants to apologize then get a drug test or even better draw blood. Then Smith can apologize. Yes, of course Chris Smith should sue, sue for a lot of money. Chris will never be the same. It does not matter how much money Chris could make. The fact is that Chris was attacked by a member of the academy that he trusted while on stage and that will always effect his stage performance.
But you just talked aboutit now though?Also,am i the only person on the internet that has watched the slow motion version of the FAKE SLAP?You cant watch that slowed down and still take it seriously.
It's absolutely wrong that Will Smith wasn't kicked out on the spot. The accolades that were stolen from other award winners, instead all the attention going to some stupid B***S***! Very poor choice not to kick him out and be done with it.
Chris Rock is the man now and Will Smith is the girl
Narc. Mama said slap your face. He gotta slap your face.
Tommy Davidson is a thousand times better than WS.
Clearly Will is a bully that only pics on smaller guys. Coward
I used to like Will Smith. It’s going to take a long ass time for him to earn my respect again. Hope he grows from his mistake.  Chris Rock is a trucker. He didn’t deserve that.
I don't understand a comedian expecting no comeback for mocking someone else's wife on a world stage. If Will didn't bitch-slap him the social media would have continued from where Chris left, and Jada would have been subject to more stupid memes. Will took that away from her and put himself there, with one crucial bitch-slap.
😆😆😆
https://youtu.be/yriaHlNqAgc
Tommy your so right about Will being a bully
What a stupid host, she wouldn’t even let him talk
Picture this on the stage stood Terry Crews, or Jason Momoa, or Dwyane Johnson the " ROCK"  who came out and made the joke, do u think the night would end with a slapping. 🤔🤔🤔🤔😳😲🖐🤚👋. Even tho the joke was said out of context.  At the end of the day it's a direct approach to him being a bully and choose  VIOLENCE "BIG GUY" ATTACKED.               "LITTLE GUY"😠😡😤
Respectfully disagree. since when does resorting to violence makes you human?
Damn everybody got a story now !  Clout chaser
What he posted on Twitter is true though.... Would Will Smith try that if The Rock was up there making that joke? I highly doubt it...
I saw Tommy's show in Texas and that was the BEST comedy show I have ever went to.
Chris Rock is very disrespectful telling bad jokes about black women…
It is a tragic shame that Will Smith chose to end his career this way just when he finally received an Oscar for his work. I remember that Jada was recruiting her homies to boycott the Oscars a few years ago over their lack of diversity. Jada rolled her eyes because she knows she doesn't have what it takes to play a badass character like GI Jane.  Chris Rock's joke was a compliment compared to what Rebel Wilson said about the couple when she was hosting the BAFTAs last month. She said "Will Smith won for King Richard but personally I believe his best performance this past year was him being OK with all of his wife's boyfriends." I wonder if she would have said that if he was actually present to accept his award but he didn't show up. Will has always had an ego problem. Remember his jealous feud with Janet Hubert?
Will thought it was funny till he looked at Jada.
Awe come on..tommy you are struggling to be relevant smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
"Why is the woman conducting the interview behaving like that? - Will came at a soft target, not a 'tough guy', Chris was hired as a clown (not an insult, by definition a jester); men are being crash dummies for women, just like in the 'hood'. - Also this was probably staged for multiple reasons, like to get the collective conversation off the Ukraine & Russia because the American public wasn't supporting another war. Crisis actors? The room is full of actors. LoL. - Another thing, Chris Rock's career doesn't rely on hyper masculinity, so Chris and Will likely decided to set this up to help Will seem tough, considering the public's perception of Will in the last few years. However that event will probably encourage people to make exponentially more jokes about Jada. - Will Smith would definitely not have done that to 'Amy Schumer'.".
She remembers the Schlitz Malt liquor Comedy Tour but doesn't know who Tony Rock is
Will was cracking up at that joke . He knew he was going to catch hell from Jada so he had to do something. And let’s face it you almost can’t control yourself from bullying Chris Rock . I know its bad to say it but the dude looks like he’s begging for it

Ok what show is Tony Rock going to be on I forgot Tony Rock is Chris brother I hope Tony beat the crap out of Will
Tommy I’ve known you since 6 years old. Your a DC dog! Stop holding back! Just say I would have kicked Will’s Azz!
Will Smith is a bully ?
Let's see....Will Smith is a AAA Hollywood actor at the TOP of his game. What could happen to make that rise....FALL?
Surviving Will Smith…😇
Y she gotta fart laugh
What do u call a spoda who has millions  of $$$? A fn  spoda. JS
Please don’t start a #Willsnuckmetoo movement…
All the great comedians need to come together and create a funny movie, we need some laughter after Covid. Seems like too many ppl are on edge these days.
Tommy Davidson, great human being.
Pause
Will Smith just resigned from the Academy.....Yahoo just reported it. I guess he's done making movies, I don't think you can make a movie if you're not a member of the Academy.
so tired of the will smith hate train
WIll's punk ass needs to go through what you and I would have had to. And what is wrong with the thousands of wigs that Jada has worn in the past? If she was worried she should have worn one. And another thing, that woman has plenty of hair, you can see the stubble. I am bald, and have no stubble at all because I'm bald! Stubble won't grow at all if you have alopecia! I just think Will is a Cuckold, and yet he stays. He's a bully and has no spine.

Dang seems like every single actor or comedian's coming out with something about will Smith.  Guess this is the way these days to improve your reputation
Yeah. Will smith has a number of bad behaviors
Chris is an a-hole.  He provoked Will.  Listen to the full interview with Will Packer.  Chris went off script,  rogue and told the unplanned joke about Jada.
Will has been p-y wiped by Judas. Family needs therapy 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Make Chris Rock rich again
dizzy broad didn't know Tony was Chris's brother
Every mf is trying to catch a ride on the hype train.
Tommy tell the rest of your fellow comedians to watch what they say cause the media will throw your own words back in your face and cause strife between fellow comedians  Satan mouthpiece spare no one.
Oh PALEASE now?????
Tommy's the man.. one funny dude...
Schlitz Malt Liquor Tour 🤣😂😅
Extremely slow
She goofy.
"No one knows what really happened?"   Wtf are you yappin about Tommy??  It was on LIVE TV.....the slap heard round the universe!   Dude, please, be upfront and just talk.
You SHOULD get an Oscar for doing Sammy Davis Jr. No lie Bro. Have always loved your work.
Will Smith needs to be in Jail like anyone else.
I think he's totally correct about why Will did it.All the talk,the pressure and so on...
Tommy had a freak out similar to wills on a radio show a couple years ago, i think it was rovers morning glory, he threatened to beat the entire staff up lol
This lady just digging for a problem
Did he get into it with everyone in Hollywood?! First Jamie Foxx, and now Will Smith? Really?
Will Smith was laughing at the joke until he saw his wife wasn't besides she laughed when her husband slapped Chris
Lol wills dirty laundry is ccoming out now once you fall you drop to the bottom
Rock is 60 year old man
I loved this guy in Livin Color! Great to see him
"Where the white women at,,!!!!"
Exactly the point I made on another video. I made the case that Will played this bully routine with a guy like Chris who he figured he could physically intimidate.  There is no way that Will would have slapped a guy like say 50 Cent or Terry Crews.  Bullies choose who they get physical with very carefully.  Slapping Chris had nothing do with defending his wife  or protecting his family because if 50 Cent is on the stage and tells that same joke, Will never leaves his seat.  And remember that Will laughed at the joke.  That joke would have been forgotten ten seconds later but because of what Will did, it will never be forgotten.  What a mess and it's so sad because it overshadowed great moments like Denzel presenting Samuel L. Jackson with an Oscar,  Questlove winning an Oscar and Will himself winning an Oscar. Not to mention that the entire evening was produced by Will Packer.  smdh
Turns out will has incidents
... thought dude was going to plug "Proud Snacks..?"
Every body knows what happened omg how dumb are y’all his ass needs expelled. If I had done it I would be in jail and I’m white and rich!
Will became a little b***h boy in that moment.
They will be coming out of the woodworks
Chris Rock's joke was actually intentionally mild to not cause offense. But Jada was offended anyway and the rest is history.
He, will smith, was not triggered by what Chris Rock said. smith was laughing, so one could assume he found the joke funny. He was triggered by the look on jada's face when he looked at her. His smile instantly left his face.
alimony must reaLLY Suck
He was the greatest in living color!
Are they going to bring will smiths dog next?  to talk shit about him
Only dif here was that the cameras were off. Great interview.!
Paul Rodriguez had a bad experience with Will on the set of Ali.
Will is a bully. I didnt believe it when the original Vivian from French Prince of Bell Air said it. But I believe it now. Will is in fact a bully. When times get rough he snaps and slaps people. Under pressure he takes his frustrations out on others it's sad and it's disgusting. When your famous and the spot light is on you. All eyes are on you. You feel you can do whatever you want and have no consequences happen. It's disgusting. Will is disgusting. I can't look at him the same way he's disgusting.
Wow ... Will Smith really is the king of all simps😂
Yes i agree with you. People talked about mental health that people can snap sometimes. I love both will and chris.but i never understand that culture that yoj need to make fun at someone to make other people laugh. I can understand if it is not something that is going to hurt. Yes will was wrong  violence is not tbe best way to express self. We all have something tbat is going on tbat we do no want peoe to play with
Tommy Davidson is a great guy. What a nice man  very intelligent
Let’s not bash and trash Will! Black community keep falling for the bait. I pray that Will and Chris receive the healing they need more so…Jada.  Looks like a lot people gonna capitalize off this incident🤔
All these comedians are only mad because there punks
In a street kinda way? What did she mean by that?
Alopecia is quite common, and she even said in a recent interview that she didn't care what anybody thought since she loved her new look so much. Many women who wear hair extensions that are braided in, or tight hairstyles that pull on the skin, develop alopecia. Beauticians are taught in school to warn clients who wear such styles of the strong possibility of alopecia occurring. Why she suddenly changed her entire feeling about how proud she was to be wearing this newest style at the very moment someone made a comment against her approval is only to guess. It certainly wasn't as though she'd covered her medical condition with a hairpiece of ANY type out of embarrassment or personal preference for the purpose of carrying herself with a different look that she preferred over the one she chose. She didn't approve that someone else had any nerve at all to point out her style. Was her intent to be the only person who had any right at all to make any points about it? Did she believe she was entitled to give her approval to anyone else who had anything at all to say about it prior to their making a comment? Was the joke that sickening to her that it caused all of her verbally self-proclaimed feelings of pride and beauty of wearing it to be absolutely torn away from her and that she suddenly felt like a spectacle of victimhood because of it? She was, was she not, making a public statement with a strong sense of personal pride in wearing it. Was the comment presented in a hostile manner? Not in my opinion. There she was looking as absolutely beautiful as any woman could ever hope to look and there was a 2 second comment from a comedian that tore away every ounce of pride she had due to her victimization of hair loss. Having worn her hairstyle the way she chose to, what would she have done had people been talking about her to one another without permitting her to hear what they were saying, even throwing looks in her direction while doing so? What would she do in that situation? But that was not the situation. No, that would've been personal.
If Chris would have busted a white creamy on her bald head like every other man Will would have made him coffee!
I really don't like how this reporter keep leading and prying.. Nosey ass
Her opinions sound like a fart..
Tommy, I like you! 🤩 There are few other people who fell on the wrong side of Will and paid for it. 🙄
Booty call!!
Jada is the Supreme Witch of her mentally ill family coven.
If you're not like it leave it get off America and your little black card crap getting tired of it
Chris Rock as-salted, wouldn't have happened to 'The Rock' 'cos he'd have shaken Smithy like a pepper pot LOL
Can’t even cap, if that nigga Will Smith didn’t smack Chris Rock I wouldn’t even known the Oscars where on, and for you hoes saying “Chris tanked that shit!”. NIGGA IT’S A SLAP
No more excuses please! If you have issues Get Therapy
Will smith has done lost his damn mind… his manipulative and conniving wife had completely ruined this man’s reputation. No excuse, but Will has been a mess ever since jadas “entanglement” came out to the public.
Give me a break!! It was so abnormal. NO EXCUSES FOR Will Smith.
First of all who gives a crap about the Oscars absolutely nobody except for the wolf people that's why their ratings are tanked all the time anymore as far as Will Smith everybody get off his brick and back you are a bunch of elitist idiots and nobody wants to listen to you anyway leave the man alone so we hit somebody who hasn't done that in some point of their life whether their kids or adults somewhere down the line usually somebody gets slapped should it be ostracized for it absolutely not the ones that should be ostracised is all these deleted that keep wanting to bring this up Let It Go that's the problem with you woke people you have no sense of humor you have no sense of anything correct DeWalt needs to be brought down hard they don't deserve to live in the best country in the world you didn't need to wake up American citizens because now we are awake unlike the woke that are still sleeping
Tommy Davidsons voice has changed a lot
Tommy Davidson is a great comedian. He was one of the funniest on In Living Color. I don't like Chris Rock's style of comedy that much, but he does have his funny insights.
Why is Tommmy being so nice … oh please …. We all have a good gut feeling about what’s going on ….. Mrs. Jada please take Will off that leash……
Tommy has the best smile!!!!
Paul Rodriguez the stand up comdian also had problem wite will.   Says hes a bully
Tommy is so funny, he stay’s stuck in my head.
This guy says a lot about nothing.
I love Tommy, he is so funny!
Alopecia is the medical term for baldness....Nothing more. It is a condition that most men - myself included - have, and half of all black women have, during their lives. It may be  hereditary, brought on by stress, or simply aging.There are many treatments, if you can afford them. You cannot hide alopecia with a low hair cut. She's had low cuts as far back as I can remember. I could not see Jada's bald patches, and looking at her, nobody would guess she had alopecia, particularly as she sported the same number one low cut as her daughter, who doesn't have alopecia. It is a CHOICE to make a big deal out of it, and it is NOT necessary to cut off all your hair. Even less necessary to announce you are cutting off your hair, and do it live on Instagram. It does NOTHING for people with alopecia.  How self-centred do you have to be to assume the whole world knows about your MILD alopecia, and even more so to make your family get in your feelings about it. Alopecia is NOT a sickness, and she can easily afford Rogaine treatment, to stimulate growth, or wear a wig, like many people with hair or otherwise. You cannot choose to be bald, say you like it, then gratuitously get all up in your feelings when your hair is compared to another baldie. Will's resopnse had NOTHING to do with 'protection'. Nobody (except Chris) was in any danger. At the point which my wife encourages me to get physical with another brother, over comparing my look with another who sports the same hair, my duty would be to calm her down, remind her the world does not revolve around her, and keep it focused on the matter at hand. These men and woman are in their fifties, for christ's sake. RIDICULOUS!  And all the fools on here trying to make it make sense need to grow the hell up.
Tommy is real. Treated me very well when I met him
You’re making white people feel real good around now this is what they like let it die down so what is make the shit out of Chris right I would’ve smacked the shit out of myself and he said some about my husband or my wife!!!!!👋
Now all of a sudden Will is a bully? Get the fuck out of here. I swear people are fake ass hell.
Omg I would love to see more of Tommy Davidson. I got real love for him and he looks so great and healthy  hey 👋
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
Why don’t we just try to let America let this die down instead of keeping it going on Will Smith as a black man Chris Rock as a black man he took her for his wife what is the fucking problem here I’m black man for once took him for his wife and there’s a problem because there was another black man ever if you have nothing nice to say shut the fuck up I’m on Will Smith side let it die down it’s over it’s done what are you gonna do time how can you deny the rights of a man for protecting his woman figure that one out let’s talk about how to go on and make love in this world you don’t like Black people anyway to ask is enough for black Americans of Black people in general so what the fuck shut the fuck up is it over what a shit shake hands apologize and go on with life life is too short and too precious so what the man snapped you would’ve snapped to let me know how you would do it if he was in his shoes I think ?
How is will a bully? Tf outta here if you can talk shit then you gotta back it up
Asking comedians who made a living roasting and making fun of people Is biased of course they don't want to get slapped when they cross the line
Will Smith is a world class creep
Would he have hit The Rock in the way he hit Chris Rock? Yeah thought not.
TRUDY!
Don't downplay , KOUNTRY WAYNE. 😮  Jesus is popping..
I think Will Smith's wife is very pretty without hair I would have made fun of that butt ugly dress that looks like a casket
So basically, Will checked Tommy for kissing his wife without her permission and that makes him the bully??? How is that bullying? 😖 No telling what else Tommy did to Jada but she told her husband as she should've. On the flip side, Tommy may claims that "they" lied to him.🤷🏿‍♀️
Sooooo many people fooled by Smiths' "Stage Slap.' YOU FOLKS REALLY GOTTA STOP BEING FOOLED BY FAKE LIFE HOLLYWOOD"   Its ALL a mirage, wake up for heaven sake.
If a white man walked up there and slap Chris Rock they Woulda took him off that stage so fast. Since it's Will Smith he'll get away with it
Lmfaoooo I forgot Tommy even existed. It's like all the news agencies are finding every black celebrity from past and present to weigh in on their opinion on the Slap and they keep finding celebrities I haven't seen in years lol
See, that's how you handle it. Fight back.
Will eww 🤢
love how people say a guy got scared so he went up and bitch-slapped another guy....wtf?  That aint scared people, thats a thug, he's ready to street-fight right now! If Rock had swung back it would have been a fight, period!
Bruh, someone needs to say what the whole world has been saying. Gloves off. Come after him and that simp’s wife…
He doesn't know anything and doesn't have an opinion on it.  Bold.
Hey, you've got to keep in mind, Will has a reputation to strike anything that's sounds "Alien" to him!  (.'o ^ p )
I dont like her hair blonde
Here come Chris people from In Living Color....Will done messed up...First Jim then Tommy ..soon as we get some Wayans...its ovvvvver...
What's the story?? Omg.. His GI Jane had an affair with her sons bff.. That's the story! F Will.
Don't care. Walk away from this drama.
It was a joke about Jada's looks, infront of her man and peers.
#oscarssogangsta
Will Smith acted emotional and weak. He acted like a child who couldn't control his emotions. Jada got him feeling like a cuck with her side men. He took it out on Chris because he would get beat up by the rapper who had sex with his wife. Willy the wimp is what I call him now. He needs to stay home if he can't handle his emotions. How old is he? He should be beyond that at his age. Let's hope he's not the next OJ Simpson.
I guess the guy who Will got into a fight, with on the playground, is going to be up next.
Poorly trained host didn't know Tony Rock was Chris Rock`s brother
Who tha hell is this guy
Yeah, I didn’t know those two were brothers either.
That look 😆😆😆
"I don't know what happened" What happened is this mother$%&* has mental problem for something so small to get to him....smh...you sad bro
Oh my god this woman and her fart noises…. So annoying….. and what triggered Will was his little cheating wife giving him the death stare when he was laughing about her cue ball head
Give this man his props.. underrated 💁🏽‍♀️
Excellent take: When emotions are high, comedy is at a low......With all due respect, there was no pressure coming off Will, he was laughing at the joke, the pressure probably came from Jada for Will to do something....verbal or non-verbal- Jada is the pressure.
Go sit your opportunist nobody asking for you but here you go azz down Tommy. And on Fox? Really!
Just because American  Caucasian  Celebrities think and act that nothing is of limits doesn’t mean that so called people of color have to follow that guideline I love Chris and am not sure he thought that far into it  and don’t agree with the slap However I do believe if I were  a comedian on stage or anywhere, before I cracked a joke on a  woman’s  bald head I would know her to know that it wasn’t cancer or some type of condition she suffered from or I would not deliver the Joke The Oscar show  rightfully needed to be immediately stopped/interrupted as soon as the joke was  made
Tommy, Tony Rock, Chris Rock
The interviewer seems so ill prepared
Has anyone commented that Chris Rock's fear of retaliation of Will Smith's goons could result in further or even fatal harm to his health and life.  Will Smith is a powerful figure even compared to Frank Sinatra.  Who wants to be constantly watching behind their back for assaults.  Smith obviously has a fragile ego.  Unless the academy issues justice this event will be swept under the rug.
Chris Rock is a class act and he's wonderful and great until people decide to turn on him. He's getting a lot of praise right now, truth be told he can say or do one thing tomorrow and the whole world would turn on him. This is why you must know who you are as a person. Don't allow people to build you up because they will eventually tear you down. What Will Smith did was absolutely wrong and no sensible person would defend it. However it amazes me, how a man can spend 30 years of his career being a class act and 1 bad choice makes people completely turn on him. I don't really understand why other celebrities are even weighing in. They should know that today it's Will Smith and tomorrow it'll be one of them! js
Will Smith a HO
Smith is obviously a violent person.
Will got scared. Scared of Jada leaving him.  Jada never wanted to marry Will but she get pregnant so she thought it best to get married.  Now that's true love.  NOT.
In a civilized society with laws, it's never OK to use violent assault if someone says something you don't like. Whatever Smith is going through is the least important priority. His vainity privilege narcissism, and his twisted freak relationship with self-absorbed conceited creepy wife - were finally exposed and show how useless, and actually a detriment, they really are to our society and popular culture. They should be cancelled and be an example of what not to do with your fame and privilege.
Will Smith would have punished this guy,  watch him box in Ali and go research the footage of all those boxing matches before Ali came on film!!!
Tommy Davidson was about to get Sweet Tooth Jones on Will💪
Will Smith is a Bully.  His know Victims  Actor Paul Rodriquez and Chris Rock and Actor  Tommy  Davidson all smaller  men then him.
She sounds like Judge Jeanie Pietro💃
There was no pressure because he laughed at the joke. The pressure came when he 👀 at his wife & seen that she wasn’t laughing. She probably was looking at him like wait until we get home & he knows that 👀, he didn’t want to fight about it with her so he took it out on Chris to take the pressure off  of him that he would have had to deal with when he got home with Jada. However, he should have taken his chances with Jada because that slap 👋 may have ruined his career & rightfully so IF it does. Next time he’ll use his words & not his hands 🙌.
Theyre all coming  out of the woodwork Boring 😴
Nope. Will was laughing at the joke. Something else triggered his reaction.✌️😔
I loose perfect Healing in Jesus' name.
Him and Chris back to the Fresh Prince This is all wild man !
this woman's face is just generally annoying
Tony is the one that Will needs to watch out for, Tony doesn't play & will definitely bring that smoke. I don't care what was going on with Will that night, he should've kept his hands to himself. Period.
Just because American  Caucasian  Celebrities think and act that nothing is of limits doesn’t mean that so called people of color have to follow that guideline I love Chris and am not sure he thought that far into it  and don’t agree with the slap However I do believe if I were  a comedian on stage or anywhere, before I cracked a joke on a  woman’s  bald head I would know her to know that it wasn’t cancer or some type of condition she suffered from or I would not deliver the Joke The Oscar show  rightfully needed to be immediately stopped/interrupted as soon as the joke was  made
Tommy is a total pro -- fielded the ball great!
Will Smith may end up in the morgue if he messes with the wrong people. Life is not a Hollywood movie, I don't think he understands, some people play for keeps. My guess is that there is already a price on his head. His swagger is going to attract somone that wants the bragging rights of taking him down permanently.
She was trying her best to instigate the situation. Not looking for solutions because it was a person of color assaulting another person of color. Tommy Davidson did an excellent job at seeing through the bs
Tommy Davidson!! Man, I love that guy! Made me laugh so hard so many times back when he was on "In Living Color" God bless you, brother!
T.D doesn't have to talk about that slap. Case closed!
Tommy said #Meetoo SMH
Will Smith slapped a Red Carpet host on the red carpet for hugging him and kissing him on the cheek.  He went postal.  The video is on YouTube.  Will needs to go to rehab for anger management.
who is Tony Rock, fox lady you should have done your homework before the interview
Yall act like Will is some kind of tough guy....
The more and more I watch this it looks like Chris Rock is leaning forward like he believes Will Smith is going to tell him something
Love this dude. He's one of the best.
Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, peacock please give Tommy D. a show! We need more TD!
We've all been getting it wrong. Will didn't slap Chris because he spoke about the movie, he slapped Chris because Chris reminded him of her unfaithfulness to him when he said Jada I love you. So sad Will can't let a woman who is about to reck him zero go.
WELL EXPLAINED...
Chris is the hero and should host the show next year.
I refuse to buy, subscribe, BELIEVE that what Chris said “triggered” or brought Will to a “breaking point” because I can’t get the image of him genuinely LAUGHING AT THE JOKE HIMSELF out of my head. Like…..nope. It doesn’t compute.
Tommy Davidson is a great comedian. One of the best.
This will be as infamous as Kanye and Taylor
Dang this is never going to end
Best show ever! In Living Color!!! 👏👏👏
I can't stand these excuses.  "He became real human".  No he didn't.  Not at all.  No person would get up during any awards or work event and just slap someone like that.  That's some nonsense that no normal stressed to the max person would do.  He wasn't even stressed.  He was laughing and enjoying things.  Nope, he's not getting any "just having a bad day" pass from me.
Tommy is also way too nice to really say too much at this point. You know he's not a fan of will's
Who tf is this lady? Shes horrible at her job.
It was rumored that Jada told will to go smack Chris at this moment I don’t know what to think of this foolishness.
Computer simon says hail satan
What Chris Rock said didn’t trigger him. Jayda triggered him. Because he was laughing at what Rock said until he saw the look on Jada’s face
She instigator and dangerous. she is interviewing you about Chris Rock and has no who Tony Rock is 🤔Have you forgotten that will Smith has a criminal history of violence when he was younger a long time.  He needs Psychiatric Help He is violent.😬 no longer a fan of Smith-or Pinket she could have been a start with Chis but No… let’s get Getto
What?!  He was scared?  Ridiculous to make this statement!
Hollywood will be it's own demise. Society will be better off imo.
The first aunt vivian was right
Talk about a man’s wife present in the room and think nothin’s gonna happen,Ha ha ha😆
Still no excuse for assault.
Scripted and fake all of these Satanists are in on this,,, this is all distraction from biden laptop
I just saw the movie Tommy did with Jada 😂
Too human. They won’t do anything to him.
Will Smith is a bully and the fact that he knew Chris couldnt defend himself just shows how weak of a person he really is. Turned his back walked away then yelled at him...how immature and unprofessional. Its been good though cause now we can all see how spoilt and overatred hollywood is. Im going back to watching old movies before all the spoilt brats came along. Ill just watch the viking and outlander series on netflix. Im done with hollywood. Besides Sam Hueughan is so far better looking and actor than the lot of them right now. In fact if he stood next to any of those entitled actors right now they would feel damn ugly hahahaha.
Chris Rock is a class act, he handled a bad situation like a pro.  Jada is holding a grudge she didn't get a Fresh Prince part & is out to destroy Will's career.  Hope Will Smith pays a high price for his stupidity, l'll never watch another project he or his wife are involved in.
Wow good to see you tommyyyyy!!!
Will and Jada will be getting a divorce.   If Jada put her MAN on HER SHOW to tell the world “she wants to feel again…..”. Meaning Wills not doing it for her… the look on Wills face is CRUSHING TO TEARS.   That woman don’t love her man like she’s supposed to.  NO WAY!   Divorce is coming their way and Will will make it sound like they’re all copasetic with it….ALL COOL.     Jada does NOT DESERVE WILL.   I’m just saying this is where they’re headed.
#CuckOnComicCrime #CuckSmacked
It’s everyone acting like gods and as if they never done anything wrong that they regretted he’s HUMEN he apologised get over it saints
Greetings. He sounds scared to me. Punk.
Their draggggging it and every celeb is tryna get the 5 minute of fame lmao
People are coming out of the woodwork with Will stories.
Lol
Woo..?
😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 he is to funny!
Ain’t nobody gonna talk about the fact that the interviewer didn’t know that Tony Rock is Chris Rock’s brother.. come on do your research..
I think Will Smith and Chris Rock should sit down and talk about it man to man.
Will Smith slapped his fame into infamy.
Tommy would be perfect to do Sammy Davis Junior
There’s a code of ethics for everyone and Chris Rock knew better than to go there!
Will was laughing at the joke
Chris did absolutely nothing to warrant that fit of violence. Nobody has the right to put their hands on you.
Well darn!  Will just go after small folks.
Nobody cares what these people have to say they're all hyping things up, why didn't anyone come out before  if Will is so horrible
I love Tommy,and he is on point.
Tell her to hush no one knows what they would have done in that moment they just like talking about your mama oops here I go🙆🏾😷❤
When a man can't please his wife in bed that he has to have her go to another man, That sad.
You want to know a sure fire way to get EVERY comic to make jokes about your wife? Walk on stage and slap a comic for telling a joke about your wife. Good job will, this won't snowball at all...
Staged.
I dont know what will happen to Will, but i am LOVING the memes.   Chris Rock showed himself to be a very composed person.
I’m wondering if Randy Rainbow will make a video? Would be a good one!
OSCARS ARE LIARS  1) If the Oscar's ask Will to leave and he refused Will Smith would have been gone by THEIR SECURITY.  2) Monday it was reported Will Packer TOLD WILL SMITH HE did not want him to leave  3) Once the ACADEMY/Will Packer realized there was no footage to confirm Oscar Security asking Will Smith to leave it brings us to the NEXT LIE 3) Chris Rock didn't want Will Smith removed! Chris Rock was still on stage when they should have removed Will Smith. Afterwards Chris said he did not want to PRESS CHARGES Chris said nothing about he didn't want  Will Smith REMOVED!  This is horrible to attempt to blame the victim. Will Packer and the Academy are trying to do some major damage control!  Will should not have made it to the stage let alone back to his seat. HOW COULD REMOVING WILL POSSIBLE BE THE DECISION OF CHRIS ROCK when he is trying to make the program flow without further delay?  To the ACADEMY and Will Packer, your LIES will not fly!
Tommy looks the best he has looked in years. Unfortunately, it's at Will's expense!
A lot of people need to get Will Smith , Wendy Williams
That's the fastest slap!✋ I've seen? 👀
Tell the judge to have a drink and stfu
"Will looked like he did the other night" Am I the only one who took that to mean lit up like a Christmas tree!!!
The moment you realize that everyone on TV is just complete trash
He didn't even give him 3 steps.
Will Simp is a  beta male bully.
Entanglement
Funny it’s like the 2nd story about Will being an a-hole in 2 days… I have a feeling there’s more stories out there.
Damn Will's gonna get Kat Williams, Kevin Hart next....gonna bully all the funny lil guys
I love him when he played cream corn
Smith acted completely irrationally. He was nominated for an Oscar and yet he slapped Rock. Didn't he know he would ruin his moment that night? It makes no sense.
What do you call a Disney character named Donald, a dollar bill and Will Smith?  Answer:  A duck...a buck...and a cuck!
Is this really more important than the pedo's,covid and the other nonsense that's going on and nearly forgot since people started waking up?
These White people eating this up they can careless about Will or Chris it’s just the drama between the two black men giving them so much to talk about.
Sammy Davis Jr ....Jr.  wanted to run the fade. He low-key got hands too. tommy grew up fighting alot.
It was funny Will an yup !  he was cracking up till he seen  GI JANE'S FACE 🤣 😂 😆 💀 THEN HE GOT IGNORANT
Sometimes l wonder if their marriage is for real 🌻 I understand nothing or no One is perfect but her children do what they want to do.The Mother does what she wants To Do 🥰 And He does what He Does. It sounds unstabling 😊
Hollywood cats are so cowardly.  Tommy and the rest.  They are all waiting to see it will regains his power.
Remember when Will slapped the reporter that tried to kiss him?
I doubt the Oscars will be hosted by a comedian.  Comedians stay in the hot seat lately.
Chris knowing the situation with his family, shouldn’t have went there.  I don’t condone violence and I don’t condone joking with people with issues.
I'm sorry but me an will would have been rumbling on stage how dare him Will an Chris have been friends for years  to long to know that Chris is not a malicious person like that an thats what comedians do GIJane was a Kool joke he wasn't thinking about her having alopecia poor excuse for Wills  actions period
A moment will Smith became real human....no, no, no, you can't excuse violence as being human.   He could have reached over to his wife, touched her shoulder or knee for support that would have said far more about him.
For someone who has an open relationship Will is very possessive of Jada. How did August get so deep with Jada I'd like to know.
Fox 5 using it as a cash booster, lining those pockets. It’s job security.
She remembers the Schlitz malt liquor tour... Yea right
@3:42 did he just give the side eye 😑
The war is going  on, women  and men  are  rapped and killed and some people  say its down by whites !!..🤣🤣🤣
Lucky that it wasn't Mel Gibson cause he would have a beat down on his coward self. The Oscar's are a Joke promoting violence by standing up clapping.
The haters finally broke Will after decades of picking.
Tommy Davidson is great !
Jesus told his disciples to turn the other cheek. Chris took it as it is, and didn't run but remain humble, calm, cool, collect. It goes to show that we all of us human race can be all broken, and brake out!* The only thing in this case that it was televised, and will is famous, on an upscale so called award show class act dresses, and tuxedos. We have to face it we live in a mayhem evil world where humanity is stringed up puppet's where evil spirit's, and demon's roam in the air, and within people part of satan's plan to destroy humanity. Satan hates human's, Satan want's see the human race die, especially those of us that love *GOD*. *WORLDWIDE FOR JESUSCHRIST IN 2O22* it's time to repent, and accept *JESUSCHRIST* in life's, and be about *GOD* live for *GOD* satan time is up, it's time for change, life is short my friend, time to live a spiritual lifestyle in faith fellowshipping with the *HOLY SPIRIT* *JESUSCHRIST* is our answer *GOD* is our solution *GOD BLESS U ALL* *AMEN* *AMEN*
This guy Smith has just shown himself up for what he really is a bully he was asked to leave he refused what an arrogant POS
😜😅🖤🖤👌✅
Tommy doesn’t get the credit he deserves.. funny man
Is it me or does she look and sound like Jeanine Pirro?
Black on  Black is ok!!
Chris rocks..... Will ?
Love Tommy, Love Chris, hate Will. Everybody hates Will.
Karma's going to bite Will hard, fame and money got too much for him! He got too much ego and abused his power, I hope he falls down on his face.
Damn she's looks like Bruce Jenner.
you can't just write in a kiss last minute he is right to be angry about that
The laundry real fam lol 😂😂
its very sad, because no one ask Chris if he was OK, that is his friend, and that can hurt more then the hit!!!!, IF that was a women the world would stop, but no one aid the victim. WOW
T.Davidson is a G. Lmao hahaha he told will lets go outside its to small in this trailer. If you know you know. He was about to see what will was really talking about hahaha
It's unfortunate this happened . If I were Chris I would have been very angry , Will Smith needs to compensate and make amends to his brother (Chris Rock)  ,if he can for what he did, and get the vultures out of this because they are making fun of the both them.
Yup Jada only rolled her eyes and Will went berserk. She wasn't pissed, it was entertainment for her, control over Will with ZERO acknowledgement what Will just did for her. https://youtu.be/YxGT4a5CFmE https://youtube.com/shorts/vb8uNWpC-Ec?feature=share  These are true   https://youtu.be/J7_cTbRRwuk https://youtu.be/qZl3bGaRiUs
Tommy is a real class act and pro with what he shared on Smith.
She's clueless...lol
Tommy seems pretty cool!! A gentleman in his comments.
Does Jada do movies. She just did an episode of The Equalizer and she was awful.  Queen Latifah tried to save it, but she couldn't.
Got human is not to react with violence.
Will is under the control of a Jada aka Miss Narcissist!! That’s what is wrong with Will. Simple psychology when you put all the pieces of their dysfunctional marriage together!! Just an observation from a person that has lived 23 years of Narcissistic attack!
I meet him at my daughter's school over 20yrs ago very cool guy!
Title should have been: "Tommy's a Big of a Bitch as Will Smith"
love this ladies' "pffffft" laugh. They are cute together in a platonic way or not.
Love you Tommy❤❤❤
Wait Will Smith gets upset because you and Jada are going to 💋 or 💋 but Will Smith it's not upset his marriage is an open relationship.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You'll think with a name like Chris Rock you would have some sort of fight about you and wouldn't let a man slap you...and don't do shiitt
Hopefully this means the Fresh Cuck of Bel-Air will no longer be a thing.
Reporters that do their homework are really amazing when results come out
Tommy Davidson's encounter doesn't surprise me now.  If WS is willing to assault Chris Rock on live TV with hundreds of people in attendance and the millions of people watching around the world, what type of person is he when there are no cameras?
I hope Will never find someone that carry a gun in one of his hysterical rampants that will be the end of his  emotional problems.
What Chris should have said to Jada was "Loved your Mr Barlow in Salem's Lot 2"......
Fuck will what about cris smh
He didn't become human,  he became hostile.
Chris Rock is beautiful !
Keep the Oscar...3 year suspension...Rock host next year
The guy that ran thru his wife never got a slap because will is a punk he ain't about that life and skinny Chris' ate that slap didn't move him so will has no power with those boney legs lol
So basically he unconsensually kissed Jada because the producers lied by saying "she didn't mind" allegedly
This woman is awful.  Didn't know who Tony Rock was post this incident? Her interview was jumbled.
C. Rock talks shit about people for a living.  Makes fun of a woman's medical condition. Idiots constantly saying "he'S a ClAsS AcT" smh
She don't remember the Schlitz malt liquor tour 🤣. Lying her a** off
Why didn't Will Smith divorce Jada Pinkett as soon as he found out she cheated??  Then just to make it worse she humiliated him on world wide TV.  Even worse he then goes and defends her on world wide TV like the whipped sucker he is. What a shame.  But Jada is just a disgusting person and a full blown narcissist and is playing Will like a fiddle. Sad...
Well now everybody is going to start speaking up SMFH
Only role I remember him in was the little rabid Zulu warrior in Ace Ventura and In Living Color
Chris should seek Revenge against this Punk.
Opinion:  Chris should sue Oscars for lack of security.  Smith took 10 seconds to approach Chris.  Chris was in shock and focused on saving the show.  Smith should have been arrested and booked for assault and battery.  THEN with a cool mind, Chris cd decide to press charges or not.  Smith should have a record.  Both Smiths are emotional messes and should be in anger management classes to start with and much more after.  They should be fined and banned.  BS on alopecia, if you have seen a women with alopecia you see big bald spots.  She is not a young person, and did a lot of hair processing; thinning hair is part of the aging process.  Plus she has worn a shaved head many times in her life.  BS for this major narcissist.  Will had an emotional breakdown and needs immediate help.
If you had told me when I was watching fresh prince of bel air that this would be happening 20 years later I wouldn’t have believed it. Will Smith seemed like such a good role model
The arrogance that Will Smith displayed as he walked back to his sit after slapping Chris Rock on the face just adds to the insult of his action.  Shame on him! I will never ever again watch any move with Will Smith in it again!
Who cares
Jada didn't allow....thas BULLCHIT. She's no real women
Tommy you are such a class act and I love you for that. Thank you for keeping it that way.❤
His interaction with Will was justified if they were gonna do a kiss and Jada didn't know about it.
Jada controls Will.....is the reason why Will was so easy to be minipulated by the expression on Jada's face ..and that's  the meaning of  controlling someone without saying anything....all it takes is a look....y'all know what I'm talking about ..That mama or daddy or Auntie that did not play ..all they had to do is give you that look and it was over.....
Will  Smith  career is done
Why do they need an investigation? The assault is on the tape.  Just look at it.
SMH.....YOU NEVER KNOW A PERSON UNTIL THEM EMOTIONS GET TO RAGGING OUT OF CONTROL :( SO WILL HAS ALWAYS  BEEN POSSESSIVE OVER THAT WOMAN . TRUST ME DON'T NOBODY WANT HER BUT HIM & THE OLD MAN WHO PLAYED  OFF SET  IT OFF LOL!!!
Will Smith is a total bully he would’ve never slapped Terry cruise or Mike Tyson
If Dwayne Johnson, a white male or a female would have made the same joke on stage that night, my money is on the reality that Will Smith never leaves his seat. Those were the actions of both a bully and a coward.
this is all juvenile, low frequency stuff.
That lady sounded way too emotional ASKIN WHY NOT WHY NOT 😂😂😂😂
It wasn't just a smack, it was a physical assault which is a crime.
Oh ffs now everyone is coming out talking smack
Tommy bout to give will some “proud snacks” and end his whole career 😂
If I did what will did, I’d still be locked up. I will never support that fucked up family, period. He belongs in jail.   But we only lock up poor people and treat common citizens like garbage. I will NEVER respect will or hollyfuckedupwoodagain.
He wasn't scared.
Step outside so he would have room to run😹😹😹.
See its the ppl behind the screen👀
Tommy, I love your Sammy Davis impression. 💕
What are those child like noises she keeps making?!
Will and his wife ruined it telling all there business to the world ,sad.
Jada checked his ass would not give some Punani and she would go beast mode on him when they got home and no man wants to hear his female pissed off at him but what I would have done catch Chris after that show if I had beef with what was said which Will really not that big of a deal
If you are going to USE the man for clickbait and to help instigate...at the very LEAST you can do is include in your clip when and where Tommy Davidson will be performing. A$$holes.
Weird Warren's VVV Video Countdown
Notice how Producers create issue for so many stars?
Tommy is a funny comedian.
That wasn’t a black tour for the Karen’s
will should of slapped august the guy who was doing we know what lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣 with we know who wow
I love me some Tommy Davidson! Freakin hilarious man! His impersonations have made me light weight pay the water bill on myself. Stay safe and in great health! Getting your book asap
Will Smith is Dr.Jekl and Mr Hyde. He's unpredictable. I never thought Will Smith would be more dangerous than Kanye West . I want to see Will Smith be in Training Day 2  Any film showing his Real Life Temper.
I said dam
human or inhuman
Who is this dry host....how did she get hired
Jada should've stopped Will from approaching the stage!
Tommy is brilliant .. I could not miss ‘in living color ‘ because he was amazing .
I think Smith should donate a million to a charity chosen by Rock.
I keep saying everybody talking rubbish & Chris making money. Let them talk Chris. Make big money
So Will has a history of this! Hmmm..
When is everybody going to get tired of discussing this smack. We have much bigger problems in society. This love of pop and celebrity culture is sickening
Jada is behind a lot of this. She is a toxic, self-absorbed person who had destroyed Wills' reputation way before this slap. It was the total disrespect and the need to prove he was "manly" that drove him past common sense. This story proves it wasn't the first time. She looks like she laughed after Chris Rock was hit. 🐍
Why are all these celebrities tryna jump on the bandwagon of something that should had never happened and was a blow to black people all over, they both were wrong! No one would ever make a cancer joke with a cancer patient in the room let alone the front row
Fine him, fine will, ban will smith from future events, if he wins video conference your awards,  chris rock to sue him for financial damages. This video will stain Chris Rocks career forever. It will not go away.
And the *INSTIGATION AWARD* goes to...   whomever this lady is?
Wow Tommy Davison trying to sell books and trying to stay relevant lately you’ve been talking about Jamie Foxx and everybody just pulling yourself up so everyone can notice you again so sad and I’m disappointing you
It wan't what Chris said that triggered Will! Cuz if you watch it again you'll see Will laughing with everyone else at his GI Jane joke! It was the look on Jada's face that triggered him cuz clearly he thought it was funny enough to laugh along with everyone else there!
Who thought this was going to turn in to a Me Too situation 😂
Can you not talk with your hands?
Don't know we haven't seen more of Tommy Davidson in the movies, he's a great comedian.
big fan of tommy..
So it looks like Will has a pattern of picking on people that are not of his stature.  I wish it was the Rock that said the GI Jane joke. "  What would you have done then Will " ??? Pussy !!
Will will roll up on the wrong one one day.😏👊🏽🤜🏽
To get within 41 minutes of one of the pinnacles of his career and then to blow it over a corny joke. 🙄
Damn Tommy is looking for a moment.  Ridculous.
Tommy be ready to throw them hands. Believe something different if you want to.
I love Tommy Davidson. One of the funniest men alive. Will Smith should have been arrested, booked, banned and sued.
The movie was Woo.
Will was drunk.   They stopped serving drinks when he slapped Chris.   A weak man, a weak right, can't deliver the goods at home, and has a wife that goes elsewhere for carnal pleasure. 🤣🤣🤣
Where’s security when you need them.  They’re not supposed to be able to just jump up on stage whenever they feel like it!!
Boy they really keeping this going 😔 😟
After Chris got slapped he should have said good thing I didn't make a joke about her boyfriend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTLrWGU6ED8.......................
it's not what Chris said....it's how the slag reacted....
Smith is a crackheaded fruit
Far more important stories happening right now
I just seen you in Detroit y'all was everything
she can get it
More celebs sticking up for him. Boy does Hollywood circle the wagons around their own.
Watch your mouth, your tongue will get you killed. Regardless of what you believe in I suggest you take notice to this saying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chris Rock you have. Class💝🇲🇽
The lady asking questions is annoying as hell. The dude just wanted to go outside to talk to will. Stop trying to make  everything out to be a fist or slap fight
Woo!
Take  his award
Will wouldn’t do this to a white man🎉
Talks a lot and says nothing
🤣good clouut trick with the book and using this to get ya book out....wow
Omg still talking about it , everyone wants their 15 mins of fame I don’t understand how his actions effected everyone’s life.  People hungry and homeless and they making a big deal about two rich men and those award show don’t care about you. Stop jumping on the wrong bus.
Jada has Will whooped!! Will Smith stop letting Jada control you!
What you have to remember is that Will Smith is a river to his people! 🤣🤣🤣 That dude is so deluded he thinks he's MLK.
Will Smith is a jealous simply dude. Read about his tripping over Jada and Tupac. And Jada ain't all that it's 2022,
That interviewer is so thick
“Like in a street kind a way” 😂 that pressure balloon…is his ego.
Tommy man you made Woo with Jada and wasn't spose to kiss her
If you slap me like that , you will have to watch your back for the rest of your life
Awe yeah?
HE IS HILARIOUSSSSSS LOL
MC's and comedians will definitely think twice now about dissing Will Smith on live TV 📺 Don't mess with the prince
anyone pushing the jab on the black community deserves to be slapped. i enjoyed it. i hope his brother confronts Will so reality can happen.
Tommy Davidson got hands. He box. That woulda been some real shit.
Even jokey comedians can be bullies too😒when keeping to have this fix focus over just one person more then once🤨.
Tommy said enough for me , Will is human  , he had a moment,  he apologized to Chris  , what the hell do people want , I tell you that want Will,  CANCELLED, Jailed, broke down , humiliated,  tell me this, exactly what  does that tell you about your mindset,  DAMN, society is SICK !! WTH 🤔
As a comedian, you really nail it when you capture the emotions of a certain type of folk to show up feeling entitled and take a quick piss on them. Typically, butt hurt folk will walk out and true fans will inch closer and fill in those seats. This particular incident just happened to take place at theatrical expo with door prizes and good cocaine.
Lol. .the way he explains/lies about what he thinks is going on with Lil Billy.
will Smith has had run in with many people.
Will Smith is a good actor but not a tough guys, all real life ruff guys I know despise bullies and usually give bullies all the smoke if they like that in they’re presence
Quit making excuses for this bully.
Did anyone check that smug look on Will Smith's face when he walked off stage? That man is truly full of himself and full of shit to boot.
This news reporter is clue less she's a bit of a tool
Oh here comes all the “victims”🙄
Now Hollywood can speak truth about Will. I have already seen other stories today. Will is very powerful in Hollywood but Jada runs his life at home. That is going to mess with your head if you are Will.
This interviewer is an instigator
Will knew what he was doing and didn’t care. Chris also knew and he held back
I'm waiting for the OG Aunt Viv to come out again telling everyone "I told you so".....🤣
Will likes to make himself feel better by humiliating smaller people
Tommy is smart how he is answering her questions reporters be trying to cause drama
I couldn't care about all those plastic fake actors, the real man in the house was Chris Rock.
I want ask a question.  If Alex Baldwin slapped Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars because Jimmy Kimmel made a joke about his wife suffering from cancer or any illness in reference of a movie character. Would we be talking about this for days and what you have happened?
Never cared for Chris Rocks' humor but I'm glad he kept things classy. Tommy Davidson is very underrated, very funny
Talk to Paul Rodríguez and he will tell you how bad he was treated by Will Smith just because he's mexican. Viva México 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇩🇴🇩🇴😍!!!
Tommy Davidson was ripped back in the day. Dude looked for any excuse to take his shirt off during his In Living Color days. It would have looked like Wolverine vs some lanky dude.
More proof the elites are treated differently.
What is this Surviving Will Smith? everyone coming out of nowhere to talk about their run in with Will Smith
Rock should have rocked simp Will with Jokes.  Imagine all the things he could have hit him with.  And it would all be true.  I bet simp Will would have not hit Chapelle like that.  He clearly did not respect Chris Rock.  I hope Rock starts making jokes about simp Will.
bullshirt. he was trying to suck up to his wife! he was laughing until he saw her reaction...
Damn Tommy that money running low huh bruh.......
bish messy ASF
Only thing worse than the slap is digging up all sorts if drama. Will Smith has been a ratings bonanza for media, youtuber’s - while they pose and feign outrage.
He's very wise interviewer as many but not all are. Stand your ground and don't be pulled into the conflicting and Vindictive spirited response women and men. Good for him
How is Chris......that's it!
Chris Rock! You're a  Class Act!!!! B1
Not the Schlitz Malt Liquor tour?!!😂😂😂😂 “Nobody does it like The Bull!” Yeah, I’m old. To all of you born after 1980, Schlitz was a popular malt liquor in the 70s/80s with some of the best commercials.
I like how he rolled his eyes when he said ,Will head was really full and Exploded.. like saying,  “ yah, whatever.” Cris Rock came out the winner in in all this. He could press charges on Will and had him arrested  and thrown out of the academy awards but he didn’t. He a better man than Will Smith will ever be.
WOW! NEVER KNEW THIS AND PERFECT TIMING. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE WILL SMITH WANTING TO FIGHT OVER A SCENE IN THE MOVIE!!!  SEEMS LIKE HE WAS AFFRAID OF TUPAC. BUT, GUYS HE THINKS THAT HE CAN BEAT HE STEPS TO
I said he was a bully I’m right he is a bully and jada loves to get him to fight people for her she’s Awful , and laughs when Will hits Chris
Will Smith is a HORRIBLE BULLY!!  Just hope He pays for what He's done!!!
I freaking LOVE this man.
Why is he on here? I went to see him at a comedy clubs and he was so high on drugs……they had to cancel
you mean real inhuman?
#FarkWillSmith
Security for comedians now
Will laughs, then smacks, then yells obscenities. The guy is F'ed up.
Wrong Chris Rock didn't upset him at that moment cuz he was laughed his wife upset him
she could be Janine Shapiros twin
Oh disrespecting again...  Lol yall deserved it!!!
When people can't take a "joke", it's because of underlying sensitive issues goin on. Comedians know this. It's their profession. I think there's an issue of Will being manipulated by Jada so much that it's transferring over to his friends. She could have said something herself to Chris. Right? It was about her. She's a big girl. She didn't do much afterwards either.
Bt thats true if 50cent made that joke will wudnt do sh@$
Fight for your love THEN go home make GREAT LOVE😈😈😂♥️💪
She slick trying to start something
I remember that 🤥
Lol. Will got the Midas touch. He putting money in all these hypocrites pockets with one slap.
Y’all not fixing to keep crossing the line then it’s someone else fault lol. You should have smack the producers.
Good answer "he became really human." Every celebrity has that right.
Will Smith and Chris Rock are good friends. Will had Chris is a dress many years ago on his show which was a first humiliation ritual. That fake slap like the one Chris Rock received  from Bernie Mac  in a movie is a guarantee Chris Rock will receive an Oscar down the road in my opinion. This is just a distraction!
Stand up for your wife if you a MAN! PERIOD!!! Let’s say, it was Tom cruise that smacked him?! Everyone would had said, HEY he was standing up for his wife! 🤷‍♂️👋😂
Tommy would put hands on willow Smith
Will Smith looks like he has a violent temper,so he could be hard to work with,I am not going to use him in my next movie.
I'm not defending Will Smith or his actions or any way but I have to say that it's pretty, F---d up that this janky-ass reporter is trying to use my boy Tommy Davidson as a springboard to talk about something that Tommy CLEARLY SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT by digging up a bunch of history and putting my boi on spot like this!!  He's clearly trying to talk about other things and this B--- has the nerve to try and set him up like this?! Screw this lady!
In an era of alphas and alpha energy(80’s 90’s Hip Hop) Will was deemed as soft and beta. He waits until his 50’s to live out”thug life”. 🤔
you kissed his wife.. what u think he was gone do
I WENT TO SEE...TOMMY DAVIDSON 2X....IN BORING...ALBANY, NY.....TOMMY DAVIDSON ...WAS SO EXCELLENT.....UPLIFTING....FUNNY....I ADORE HIM ''& HIS COMEDY....!!!  I ADORE CHRIS ROCK....HE IS REAL...FUNNY 24/7...DOWN TO EARTH COMEDY....FUNNY AS HELL....!!!
Will was jealous that Jada got attention on Will's special night.  So he punched Chris. 👊
I wonder if it was a heavyweight fighter up there doing that part of the show saying the same joke what would have happened
Stop making excuses for Will Smith!
Props to Tommy, he didn't throw will further under the bus and stayed professional. Salute
Y'all feeding into the media with  the bs and she don't know who Tony Rock is!!! Smh
Now they about to get all the black ppl who don't like Will to slaughter him. Sucka shit!!!!
get over it already
This was a ______ moment.
Rock is rude very rude
You can take a man out of the Gheto but can’t take gheto out of him.
Jeez..what a class act with his thoughtful, nuanced answer. This incident is really showcasing a lot of beautiful masculinity in the Chris Rock, Tommy Davidson and of the world.
Chris Rock Could Sue The Oscars For Not Protecting Him Or Anyone on that stage.  👏👏👏
Don’t ever talk to Fox News 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 this news with fucker I mean tucker trump lover a big no no ! If you intelligent
This lady didnt know who Tony Rock was ... smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
"When Emotions are High, common sense is at its all time Low." - T. Davidson
Will has opened the slapping floodgates upon the Earth. Expect to see much more of this from any and everybody.
"Where's Security For The Oscars! 🤔🤔🤔
Will Smith think he getting away with this mess!!! You gotta pay protecting a Jezebel seriously.
They reeeeeally dragging this topic huh... They running with this shit to the bank and back. LIVE YOUR LIVES PEOPLE AND WORRY ABOUT YOURSELVES AND DON'T FEED INTO THESE DISTRACTIONS, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS WORLD BUT THIS IS NOT IT PEOPLE. THE MEDIA IS PLAYING YOU!
👏👏 To Chris Rock...my heart goes out to him and family...❤️
What's crazy is that Jada didn't like the joke but she was laughing after the fact when Chris Rock made a comment after he got slap. She is a crazy one too.
i agree that Will is a human being.  People forget that actors are human as such they react.   and as will said,  because of their careers people.expect them.totolerste  disrespect, making fun oof them and smile, but there is so much a person can take sometimes
Liquor for Will Smith is now abolished.
Will Smith is a chump baby ass Hollyweirdo . I wanna hear what Martin Lawrence has to say about this.
Well I guess Will Smith has a severe insecurity issue and emotional problem with Jada The Manipulator. Well, lost respect for that pathetic wretch. Love his work though. Messy human being.
OMG, I miss Tommy!  He was soooo funny on ILC…
If aquamarine would of done that joke.he would stood there.n say thank you
Sounds like he weighed in to promote his book
Tommy D is funny as hell in living colors 🤣 😂
I remember this guy on In Living Color....he was hilarious! I wish he was in more movies ...we could do with some of his humor nowadays. Also...Will Smith is a POS and coward. Jada is toxic.
Mommy Jada gave will the eye.
We know what time of day it is with you rich people you guys do whatever you want
I believe same too. Will Smith showed bully antiques when he slapped Chris. He wldnt have slapped Dwayne Johnson the rock  or Idris Alba. No one triggered his behaviour, cos he initially laughed at the joke too.
im guessing, will and jada will soon be announcing a divorce
I also had a run in with Will Smith.
'Creamcorn' himself lets go.
So since Joanna is asking what the Academy is going to do with Will Smith, ask the “Academy “ what they are going to do with the two rapist that they “honored” with Oscars also? Weinstein the rapist and Roman Polansky the CHILD RAPIST WHO FLED THE US SO HE WOULD NOT DO THE JAIL TIME! He is still a fugitive from justice here in America! What buffoonery!
That Mr Smith has got some issues and he needs to take care of it with the a therapist maybe two or three therapists whatever it takes
Will just go after smaller men
It doesn't matter you rich people need to get some help violence is violence
Did you hear the reaction that the interviewed gave when she ask him if he was going to talk about the slap that will smith gave to Chris Rock. That should tell u a lot about this racist media.
A different times n a person’s life things happen - she’s Messy trying to start sh:) just stop it - who is she - she’s Messy ….
Notice that Tommy's incident and Rock's both involve Jada Smith.  She's the one who stirs the pot, it looks like.
Tony won't talk of it as it should not be mentioned incase Chris wants to pick Wills wallet
When sharks smell blood in the water .
I hate bullies
Chris Rock is receiving global praise while Will Smith is receiving global condemnation
Will is a wife man... he is afraid of his wife... that's why he lost control... he thought he would be a winner and be a hero for his family. But shame on him... and the bad hypocrisy of Hollywood... the Standing Ovation... SHAME ON ALL STANDERS!!! SHAME!!! NOT WORTH FOR ALL FANS WHO MADE YOU ALL FAMOUS!!!
⭐⭐💬What's crazy! this video of you protecting a black woman will be the video use showing that you abused Jada when she's ready to leave! SORRY BRUH!
I wonder what the original Aunt Viv thinks about this incident
You know this lady a low key freak
He still looks good after all these years.
Why does she sound so HYPED UP to hear this.. Tommy u should’ve picked another host like someone that’s NOT talking down on your people and she laughed at u when u mentioned getting an Oscar for playing Sammy Davis.. Tommy pick better interviewers
tommy's just the greatest
Jump on the bandwagon!
Everyone stop. Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring
Tommy is 5'6". Will likes to swing low?
I don't think it was the joke. I think it was who said it.
He would be perfect as Sammy Davis Jr.
Chris is one of the few people in Hollywood that most people can say is a good, gentle soul. Will Smith was a bully an an animal
02:53 This is the Best and most Honest reaction ever 😆
The lady doing the interview is dense.
she remember the schlitz malt liquor tour… 🤥
This is what happens when you have an OPEN relationship. He gets overprotective when he is around knowing that when he isn't around, other men have the prospect to have their way.
Oh my
Will Smith walking away after the slap.. Will Smith, if you read this.. That was a ultimate douche move. Shame on you.
Who next? Jim Cary.
Totally 100% Bully
Jada is toxic and Will should probably run from her now
If Will didn’t laugh at the joke FIRST - I would believe he was “protecting” her…but it looks like she used her MK Ultra mind control powers on him
If it hollers make it say gi  jane everyday,yor on kids ,rusian tanks.
Every time I see that 'slap", I just do NOT see any actual "Connect" of Will's hand to Chris's face. I do guess that maybe I am wrong, surely after all of the people who have seen it, IF I was right, a bunch of people would have pointed it out.  BUT, common sense tells me that what GOOD would FAKING it do anybody involved? Even IF Chris rock didn't press charges, anybody who saw it COULD press charges.  Sure many people look up to Will Smith and love him, BUT, IF this is all REAL, and really, it must be... he just has to get some type of "punishment" for "losing his cool" because a goofy jokester told a joke that WAS IGNORANT as all HELL.  Maybe Will should have held back his temper until he could get Chris Rock alone and THEN "bitchslap him" NO cameras. Violence is NOT a good way to settle things, BUT, sometimes a quick slap will make a point. A brutal "beatdown" would be going too far. Even some harsh WORDS would be enough, BUT, at least Will had just did a quick slap, likely NOT enough to hurt Chris Rock, and to me I don;t even see Will's hand connect with Rock's face.
So good to see Tommy !  He has brightened some gloomy days in my life with his comedy.  I would like to thank him.
To not know that Chris Rock has a brother, when your are interviewing someone, is there research done?
~Heyyyyyyyyyyy Tommy Davidson!!!! One of MY FAVORITES~
The way Chris reacted and handled it in the moment is true showmanship. Didn’t skip a beat, cracked a joke and went right on with the presentation. I feel so horrible for him, that happened in front of the world and literally ALL his peers. And now this resulting media circus.
Love her accent
So basically Will Smith is only willing to go at the small guys
Will Smith is a "Real Thug"
More comedian’s need to come about his behavior. I knew he was a bully he just hides it well.
Go Away Tommy please .🙃🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
I love how everything is a soap opera nowadays.  Keep talking about it ,over and over until you think your right. People are ridiculous nowadays.  You all will never survive living in the real streets. A slap ,really wow . You disrespect my wife ,I will kick your ass. Especially on national TV. Think about it 🤔.  Medical conditions is not comedy 🤷🏼‍♂️
will smith is the black tom cruise they belong to the same church!
This dude was super funny n the 90s
??? Keep Jada's name out your mouth? Jada never shuts up, her dumb red table show.. that's why people joke about their marriage... SHE PUT IT OUT THERE!!! She's an epic narcissist making everything always about her. Will needs to go be mad at her over the joke she made of him, not Chris's G.I.Jane softball.
Will slapped this man on Sunday it's Friday wtf yall still talking about this? Yall more salty about it than Chris is Chris didn't press charges nor did he want him removed so move the hell on!!
Dont give will excuses
Make WILL SMITH the NEXT Illuminati Sacrifice-that’s what they NEED to do. Say BYE BYE.
He never got human... humans think before they feel using the wisdom and intelligence they were designed to make use of the properly weighed consequence... he became beast... because that's how a beast would respond in general...
"pressure balloon" my ass! IF that were 50 cent up there Will would have stayed in his seat and addressed it back stage!
Tommy ain't going..."Come outside!" (inserts MOE 3)
Will Smith needs to be taken down a few notches. He's getting to big for his britches.
If will Smith did this to a Caribbean person trust me thy would beat up will Smith out of order
Chris won't have to mention this again. His peers in comedy are coming for Will guaranteed. Tony Rock is up 1st.
Who is that woman?
Come on Tommy you jiving
Tommy Davidson, why are you on Fox talking to that heifer though???
"i remember that" yeah I'm sure you do 😂😂
Cream corn 🌽 still doing thangs !!!! 😂🤣
This lady interviewing Tommy is terrible and completely clueless....FFS
Is that judge Janine?
Isnt that Oscar from proud family???
He became real human...
Everybody bullied Tommy Davidson so he say
He did a movie playing Sammy Davis Jr.?
How is TD 60 years old next year? Looking 10 years younger.
Tommy was in the movie "woo" he looks different.
Even this guy is weird. Just spit it out man. I’m just done with the craziness. Vote republican. 💯
He’s got an overblown ego & thinks he can do whatever he wants cause he’s so important in his own mind. Even in his own memoir he sats how he wanted to kill his own father & he knows he’d get away with it bc no one would ever believe he did it cause he’s Will Smith. He’s a sick person. I hope he gets the help he needs.
All the money they got they need to buy some class!!!!
First ever oscar and he will only be remembered for the slap. Now ain't that a SLAP in the face!
Everyone that knows Chris has wonderful things to say about him. About Will it always starts with I don't really know him well but he seems..... Speaks volumes.
Did Chris triggered it or did Jada?
Smith hid in a cupboard during BET Awards scared of Suge Knight looking for him - f*ck Will Smith
man I want to see a Tommy Davidson concert legend
Will was an old skool Philly pimp. He came up w/ the great idea to have the "good guy" image.  Moral: bad habits die hard 💯
Oops a pattern of violence from Will. A number of people has come out about his bad behavior.
#weakasswill
"A moment where he became a real human." ??? Say what?? Well, real humans who physically assault other real humans usually end up in jail.  But I guess not for a celebrity. This is tragic that this man is not behind bars. Black privilege.
So many princesses in Hollywood.
He needs material and some air time.
Yes he would make a great Sammy Davis jr
A real human moment, that’s some real talk🙏🏾
the woman has a auto immune disease that causes loss of hair, its not cancer, not sickle cell, it wont cause death, but its a disease that she is dealing with and i wont minimize it. a joke is when you laugh with, an insult is when you are laughed at. since 2016  rock has been going in on Jada without incident,in public,on tv. so will went in on Rock with the Oscar smack down. doesnt matter if he loses his fans,friends,or freedom. he did what he thought  was the right thing to do.  chris rock and other comics push boundaries,test limits to elevate their craft and should be able  accept any consequences from that rock should have slapped his ass back, doesnt matter how much money he would lose,how many people he disappoints,money should not be placed above defending yourself. "... violence has  no place in society..." is only said after  minorities began to fight back and ,get weapons . Violence is how this country was made, how its kept "safe" and apparently how it has been entertained.  replaying this slap over and over again trying hard to find a reason behind it. the reason was simple "u have made my wife the butt of your jokes for years, insult me insult my career , and even my choices but my wife,no matter how crazy she is ,no matter how many faults you think she has,she is still my wife and this hand..belongs to your face 🖐✋🤚SSSSSssssslap wait..wrote this on the wrong post🤭.... nevermind
Will smiths Oscar should be taken away from him , that will be best for the Oscar club or there will be no more respect for Oscar club members in the world or respect for Oscar awards
nobody talking about @2:58 ?
Dry snitching
Tommy Davidson is STILL such a cutie patootie
This lady is trying to start something and make him say him and will was about to fight. I would have said no you stupid b****....stop asking me all these questions.
Oh, this altercation involved the psychological parasite as well. No surprise there.
Tommy, where you at! Comedy!!!
I guess now all of a sudden everyone has a will Smith story  alright here's mine will Smith has beat on me since I was  12 he's an animal he tried to kill me just last week  I mean he's just the meanest guy the world has ever known
Im sorry aunt viv for not believing you about will
Did they ridicule Tommy Lee when he punched kid rock at the VMA awards. No? And isn't there a war going on that the US is involving their selves in? Enough with the nonsense. Who cares about this slap? Between inflation and gas prices going up that should be the focus.
In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playgrounds where i slapped most of my days
Did he just sneak diss "Country Wayne"
Stop the baiting!!!! Thank you Tommy yes again he's human!!!!!
Hair loss not the real issue? Perhaps Chris hit a hidden raw nerve - some family member very close to Will maybe has underlying mad Oscar ambitions - perhaps a higher level movie than GIJane would have served the joke better? That slap was strong and loud - had lost income and unrealized fame behind its intensity? Kudos to Chris!
Will Smith needs to get away from Jada and see a psychiatrist to find himself again. He is lost.
This lady is a horrible interviewer
Will Smith is the biggest fool. prior to this i just thought of him as a great and likeable actor. now i know him as the biggest cuckold of all time. No one cares about Jada Smith. no one watched her stupid red table talks. now the whole world knows she slept with her sons friend and then made her husband come on her stupid show (that until now no one had ever watched) and squirm through a conversation about how she had to cheat on him because "he hadn't made her feel good in a really long time" Will Smith is a coward, a bully and the ultimate cuckold.
Chris Rock, Won the Spiritual Humanitarian Oscar.  He is the Bigger Man!!!!!!!!!!!  Huge Respect.
Will Smith would have mopped little tommy up he wanted to go outside so he could run like a little biach
Will Smith can't take a joke but hero Chris Rock can take a punch. Chris is the Rock.
TOMMY! ANOTHER BAD CAST MAN! BLESS YOU TOMMY.
Will a bully😑
Haven't seen him since Ace Ventura
This has really caused me to disrespect WS.  I was a huge fan and to find out he is a bully breaks my heart. 🥺🥺 I don’t like bullies. No matter who they are.
This news woman is really annoyingly aggressive.
"When emotions are high common since is low."
TOMMY TELL TONY.....
Davidson should portray Thurgood Marshall with those glasses!
He meant street
TOMMY TELL TONY....to tell Chris to sue The Academy for the lack of security,  $500 million sounds right.  Also sue Will Smith, he has violence in his past that includes a police report and some actors have seen his dark side, $500 million for assault....."cut that check."
https://youtu.be/sSf6DDTYIQY
Why does this lady keep farting during the interview??
How ya Liv"n?
I don’t understand why Will acts this way because He and his wife support an open marriage????🤫
This is really the shit we’re all focused on?
Chris rock is the definition of being a pro in the entertainment business
Chris and Tommy vs Smith equal love to bully small comedians.
Insanity - Drugs - Violence - Awards - Medals - Egos - Wealth - Arrogance - Alcohol - Racism - Bigotry - War - Destruction - ETC. - It's what we do - by now you would think maggots would be used to realizing we'll never find the missing links - cause the missing links are not missing at all - they're right there in front of the entire human racists.  It is just human nature to go around wanting to slap someone - hell - I must see a dozen people each day that I would love to kick in the ass - for starters every politician I have ever known needs to be beaten into a pulp fiction obliterated from reality. That would be my American dream come true.
What a simple minded reporter.
We know what happened..... it's called narcissistic abuse.  What seems shocking to the world is actually text book behaviors of NPD.   Will needs to get away from his abuser Jada.
Joan Rivers would have needed more plastic surgery if making jokes about someone was fuel for violence.   How many women did she joke about ? They may not have liked it but they did not take revenge.  Jada is not the "special" one.
He Had run in because of, "Woo"?! Damn😂😂
So who are you going to slap next Will Smith? Adam Sandler maybe 🤔,oh wait, he's too big
Is Tommy gay?
Tommy had a hard life and I’m not surprised he stepped to Will and was prepared to “iron out the laundry” lol. You got to be careful who you think your going to handle, because there’s going to be that day, that someone humbles you in a way you don’t want
This HOST is SO THIRSTY!
Protect your own yo', snitches get stitches.
Tommy does the best Sammy Davis Jr ever!
I like him but, actually this won’t ever be over with for Will.  Everyone knows who he really is.  He has to deal with his sick a$$ now…
Will smith compared himself to his character king Richard. I won’t watch that movie. I hope king Richard is a better person than Will.
⚠️ I WAS Legend ■   Will laughed at Chris' joke so it CAN'T BE the joke. It was Jada's reaction that made him do a 180°. Now, with Will issuing a public apology to Chris (whether it is sincere or not doesn't matter - he officially released it), anyone now who will STILL defend Smith, will be defending a condemnable & unacceptable act which Will himself claimed in his OWN statement. OK, try going for it. Doing so, one will contradict or go against what the main person in this case is now claiming.💥✅️
Jada Pinkett Smith, Tommy Davidson and Duane Martin Were in a Movie Together? No wonder Will Smith appeared on the set. I wonder who Jada's love interest was in the movie "Woo"? THIS IS TOO WEIRD
Tommy was hilarious in Ace Ventura...
That pressure balloon was Jada's Medusa stare.  That stare of hers will make the devil put the fire out in hell.  Tommy got grey hair but he definitely looks the same.  He is aging well.  And yes I would rather hear what Tony Rock has to say over what Tommy has to say about the slap.  Schlitz malt liquor tour LOL!  I heard of the chitlin' circuit but Schlitz?
This man is funny as hell!!!
This dude was skinny but was in some good shape, I think he did call Will on that day after some words and obviously Will didn't accept, but Will wasn't as physically big as he is now either.
Great interview!!
I think Chris and Will should just smack and make up
This lady is hilarious
Omg is that Jeanine the judge 😳
He should have been removed...then after he won the oscar, he would have realized that his actions had consequences...
these White folks going after Will now. I'm on team Chris Rock and Team Will Smith. They need to focus on them deplorables who stormed the Capitol. Those Terrorists in America and the two time impeached disgraceful former POTUS; who incited an insurrection. Two Hollywood African American Men they will be alright. There's bigger fish to fry in America.
🤭😂😂 Tommy's "yeah right 🙄" eye roll at 3:39 has me dying. He is definitely one of the Greats 👏
Both boys played their hand wrong. Who asked this black man to tell the malicious medical joke about an ill black woman? A Better Lawful Response: Can I tell you about the medical condition called 'Alopecia'? An Ethics Sanction: The Provoker was unethical toward his female Victim and should be required to make a large endowment to the charitable 'Alopecia' community to help find a cure on behalf of his female Victim.
i can’t wait to hear from dave chapelle,quincy jones & ashy larry 🤔
You know I am not surprised that the only comedians not standing by Chris is Tiffany and Kevin, Katt Williams always said this was how they were.  As for Trevoh Noah I am disgusted in him as an African, he knows he was taught better than that, we do not suck ass Trevoh!!  I am just glad Chris has remained professional and is not going to stoop to the Smiths level.
Love you Tommy🥰
When emotions are at an all time high ,  common sense is at an all time low. Wow if that doesn’t give a synopsis on today’s society I don’t know what else need to be said. Well said Mr. Tommy Davidson.
Sooooo being a real Human is being  Violent. No excuse for what Will did in front of the World.  Bless Chris Rock for being the Real Man !!!.
What's gonna happen next at the Oscar's are they gonna start gangbang shooting?
Paul Rodriguez (actor/comedian) who was excited to work in “ALI”  w/ Will also spoke about how terrible he was treated by him and was saying negative remarks about “Mexicans”. It was heartbreaking to hear Paul talk about it. Seems Will is only interested in being nice to bigshot actors. His true colors are showing.
