You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
When new video?
😢😮😮t yet to see the rest but the first time we saw it was in the early hours of yesterday e
Goals
A good chase but it's in Arsenal's hands
" Haaland - Haaland no one can't Stop him "
Haaland wird eines Tages alle Rekorde gebrochen haben die CR7 und Messi aufgestellt haben, wenn er Fit bleibt 🙏👍
Haaland kalahan sama ronaldo aja kalah
Haaland ❤
‏اللعابة خاصهم يلعبو الكورة وما يسوقوش لهادشي لي كيدير الجمهور ..  إلى دارو بالهم فالميدان وخواو راسهم غايتأهلو ...  تاريخ الراجا عبارة عن معاناة من الظلم والفساد محليا وقاريا .. الاستثناء هو تكون ظروف عادلة.. ورغم ذلك تاريخنا شبعان ألقاب لي جاو من ملاحم باقي عالقين فالذاكرة.
Halland God Bless U are monster from God
Haalminator
PEP DUMBIORLA
Less matches coz of injuries and yet debut season breaks the records & has more goals than Chelshiiittt 😅
Ndidi participated in all 3 goals
Halaand will be the historic scorer for premier league after only match .😯
Like the fact this kid scores EVERY type of goal! Impressive season
Shame Pep decide not to let him go for another hat trick and break Salah's record
Haaland it’s very similar to prime Fernando torres (style of play ) and hevin is his Gerrard
Yo
❤
Алин Холан убийца просто.  А давайте ЛЧ возьмёт Ман Сити, а АПЛ — Арсенал!😅
Stones' goal was absolutely wonderful
53 goals in less than 40 games (by mins played) for club and country for Haaland this season so far... outrageous. 47 goals in just over 34 games (by mins played) for City with still 10-14 games left to play...
City fans are INSANE!! I don't think crowd reactions to goals at the World Cup were HALF as loud as City fans! phenomenal
City are going to lift the trophy
What a goal from Iheanacho
Watching a football match is great but think Jesus-Christ the son of the living God, is the way, the truth and the life. The day of repentance is today. Jesus-Christ is the only one who overcame the death. Stay blessed
It's important to work harder on developing the second team. The match could have ended 3-3 or 3-4 in favour of Leicester. The second team has to offer more.
لا تنسوا الصلاة على النبي محمد
How about Haaland's first touch for the second goal? Ridiculously good
new Era (Haaland) is really about to come,, just perfect time to says good bye for our 2 old stories but still massive respect for them,, we need a protagonist side to join Haaland as antagonist one,,
Manchester City please I need help I want to play Manchester City and am in Ghana please help me football is my talent. I am 15 years old.When you help me I can become one of the best players in the world.
The 34 goals of Alan Shearer will be broken by Haaland with less matches and his first season.
I am sorry but why does Phillips fall on ederson in leicesters goal? Any player would stay on their side of the post and not intentionally hold down their goalkeeper. That was atrocious
champions!!
Haalandroid 🤖
🎉🎉🎉
If Man City had a decent goalkeeper they would be unstoppable.. Ederson is the weak link in the squad…the man would not know what a clean sheet was even if it fell on him.
stones such a british name hehe
Never thought man city would ever type "ihenacho"  again
Imparable el Niruego
Haaland….. wat a talent
Quien le podrá ganar al MC
Halland is unstoppable 🔥
It's terrifying what Haaland is doing right now
If you read you like cricket
Love you 💙😘 my team
Frankly it must be said Erling Braut Haaland is the current top scorer and the second best player in the world currently behind Kylian Mbappé Lotin.
Man City for life beautiful goal by Jones
Champion  liga liga juara
🎉
KDB is the best, he is incredibly precise and intelligent and sees more  than others
El compañero que De bruyne necesitaba era haaland
Haaland
Remember the clowns saying Haaland would flop in the Premier League? Where are they now?
Ihenacho is a blue .
Halland bring joy
City always amazing to watch thanks to Stones and Haaland, big congrats to you all Citizens another 3 points added to our Bag.
Haaland the next cristiano ronaldo
Da mucho Terror Haaland.
From an Arsenal fan, congratulations with another title! You guys are just incomparable this season 🔥🔥🔥 Waiting for Haaland's new EPL goals record! 💥
I predicted it’s was going to be 3 -1 😊
Haaland machine 🔥
Halaand this guy is unstoppable 🐐🔥🔥
Vocês tem que deixar o haaland jogar. Não pode tá tirando o homem
Our coach is the best
Man City always
Stones
*Машина*
Кто-нибудь уже предложите Холланду повысить уровень сложности!!!
I wonder why Haaland still doesn’t have a celebration
Can Mbappe and Martinelli catch up?
That haaland is something else and nowhere near his prime
Ayoo semangatt kejar arsenal
soon the grand finale Manchester City Arsenal which champion it heats
LEICESTER 💙😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
haaaaaaland!!!!!!!
Haaland's game is the best in the world Man City are a 🎉 champions

Iheanacho just scored the easiest goal in football history
شكرا لكم جميعا 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
The Manchester City winning the Champions League would boost Erling Haaland's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or. With his impressive skills and goal-scoring ability, Haaland is a sensation in the world of football. If he helps Manchester City secure the title, it would strengthen his status as one of the best emerging players. With his incredible potential and young age, he could be a serious contender for the Ballon d'Or in the near future.
Haaland is the best striker right now
He runs the show every weekend.haaland
Manchester City will win this league. I see Arsenal collapsing.
Premier League Title is Man City to lose !! 👍. See you pretender (Arsenal) !!😂
40 yrs Arsenal fan here we go again, well done to City 4 winning the treble maybe👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Don’t show the score in the thumbnail! I’m good at ignoring the info but that’s hard to miss
I think Alvarez is a better player than Haaland if you pass the ball to Haaland he can score but Alvarez can dribbling like Messi and score goals I think Man City coach Pep Guardiola should keep Alvarez in the starting XI he is aguario Will take place in the future
I am from Bangladesh
dude literally has the worlds ugliest haircut / hairdo whatever
Halland is a beast I am a man utd fan but this is just not human want a player
Haaland 🤯🤯🤯
HAALAND IS A LION
니얼굴은 홀란드
That goal by Stones was amazing ❤
Haaland FC
Monster dari norwegia
Johnny, Johnny Stones, Johnny, Johnny stones!
Start doing this for Norway.
I feel bad for the "every goal so far" video editors who have to redo their video every week.
Haland is the best
Balon d'or 2024 goes to haaland
Latihan mulu, kapan tanding nya yah😅
Congrats 🔵🔵🔵🔵
Haland is Monster 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some of these players better become coaches just like Guardiola.
Холанд золотой мяч уже года два должен был получать
Goooaallalalal

Stones goal 🔥
Haland the best
Best match
rhtk nsrhs tukv
WW COME ON CITY🎉
This new system of Stones playing as a hybrid in midfield is working perfectly we blowing teams away with this 3-2-4-1 system Pep is a trend setter give that man a Bell's
Two pernalty robbed for leicester. What a shame😂
Manchester city is my blood
Great goal from Stones and THE VIKING is on course for 40
Erling Haaland is a Phenomenal Player 💙👑
ice cold finish and celebration of Iheanacho 🥶
Don't know if it's Halaand's positioning or KDB's precision. Class acts!
They're going to win UCL this season..
Nice Stones
good list just that Sangakarra wld always make my top 5
iam kinda sad for city and halaand. They are so weak with him. After analysing every Game of the Season doing some maths, called some analysts, talked to my fortune teller, Played about 100 Games of Fifa with all different Setups i can clearly say, City is much much weaker with Halaand
How arsenal are top suprises us even as arsenal fans
Manchester city will win english premier league and champions league ( 2022-2023)
De bryune🔥🔥🔥
Grealish 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat Grealish
💯
hes on 32 now  no stopping my guy breaking the record
HAALAND IS THE GOAT!!!! YEA PEP YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME IN FUTURE HE IS THE BEST
Haaland love
John Stones looks like he's played there for years.
KDB and Haaland's combo have been always deadly.
Que golaço da P0RR4 que o Stones fez e Haaland... Sempre quebrando recordes e mais recordes... 32 gols na Premiere League  Agora é só esperar por quarta-feira
Haaland is unstopable
David Luiz plays with leicester now?
iheanacho scored against his former team
John Stones Huhh " Come To madrid Halla Madrid 🙌🔥🔥🔥
haaland is magnificiant. no one can beat him
If city get haland before three or four year..... Champions leagu and Bal n dyor decorate kdb's shelf
haaland is not human. the matches lately proves it
Halaand is on fire
Haalands first touch from Kdbs through ball amazing
Oh Erling, what a player. Best goalscorer for his age that's ever been seen
Iheanacho realizes his full potential when he plays against City.
Nice ❤
What a goal from stones
Haaland is the GOAT But whole Manchester City is best team in the Premier League :)
Haaland gonna
this might have been one of the most crucial wins of the season
Haaland cracked the fotball code
arsenal ketar ketirr
🎉
As a united fan, nothing but respect for this magical kid.
Stones keeps doing it
Can Man city just focus on winning the Champions  league and leave the premiere league for Arsenal☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
ขนมกรุบ
big respect from ilheancho he didnt celerate cuz he knew they lost
Sometimes I wonder if halland is a human
Лёгкие +3 для сити!
สงสารทีมตกชั้น
CTID!!!!
Should’ve been a draw
YouTube Miftah Excel 95 🤗
Why you take a record breaker OFF!! when he is on another hat-trick AND!! has the chance to beat Sala, I will never understand.
I more goal and feeling has broken Salahs record
the half volley was lit
Haaland Welcome to Madrid
Best Man City team ever.
Brilliant win from Man City
💙💙💙
Haaland fichara por otro equipo con más champions league en 1 o 2 temporadas.
Why is Maddison so rubbish?
Haaland better than Selfish Mbappe
Great ...
Witout kdb maybe difficult
Stones and Rodri Really drinking a KDB serum.
🌹🌹🌹
😢😢😢why man city coach sub halland and play only 45minit,halland need to score more goal and hattric i hate pep i dontlike man city coach but i like only halland but i hate pep get out pep from man city or halland go to real Madrid i want to see and play full time in another coach 👎👎👎👎👎pep😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎
still team city never fail
Manchester city is three points different from Arsenal, hopefully they can catch up and become champions
That was a perfect penalty, such brilliant precision!
Манчестер первый клуб, который разрешил играть футболисту с синдромом Дауна. Только за это можно болеть за Ман Сити
I haven't watched a football match in 10 years or so but I'm curious about Haaland. His first touch and movement is amazing.
Even stones can score better goals than haaland Haaland can only score pens and tapins he is a tapin merchant 🤣🤣
Good job
Pep doesn't want Halaand to break records😪
Tap in merchant
Haaland too much
Where are the extended highlights to the  City Bayern game?
Haaland layak dpt balon d or
Jack Grealish lacks confidence when Halland runs along with him. He didnt make an effort to run when DeBruyne got the ball...just stopped so Bruyne then passed the ball to Halland.  I have noticed this same pattern also a lot in past matches  Also he didnt ask for the penalty kick to be taken by him. Even though he had created that opportunity.
Haaland tried to miss the pen but literally proved he cant miss 😅
Paaland tap In + penalty I know my goat
Pep taking haland of all the time 😡
Man city the best team in the world 💪🌎
Debruyne is the best player in the world. Not haaland or mbappe. DeBruyne.
💙💙💙💙
KDB-Haaland never disappoints🔥🔥💪Perfect combo🙋💯
Halland > Mbape
Robot
CTID 🩵🩵🩵
Haaland epl goat
My beast keep going❤
The best of all time 💙💙
Man City 👇🏻
Primer league is over hyped . Ronaldo at age 36 scored reckless number of goals  in a league they claim is toughf. Halaand has exposed the league to be weak. I wonder how terrible it will become when Messi or Mbappe or even Vini comes .
please stop it city.
Erling scoreland always delivers❤
Now arsenal is getting it out of hand, it belongs to all time champions mancity
If Pep wouldn’t have taken Haaland out on the 46th minute, he would’ve broken the goal record of a 38 Games Premier League season, and maybe even the 42 games Prem Season
Absolute stunner from Stones 🔥
Man City being called the Blues that's an error 😢😢
Stones goal is the best goal in the season
жесть, что за монстр...надеюсь, будет долгие годы нас радовать такими голами. болею за другую команду, но это неважно вообще..
34 premier league record isn't that high before, eveny in 80s, there were few near 40 in one seazon. All time Brit recors is 60.
Ederson's in form again! I'm so happy for him ❤️ Come on City, we gonna win all this year
Haaland🐫😁
Haaland is an Alien!!sheesh get him outta here on this planet earth🏳😆
Trust me arsenal will not get those kind of penalty
I was at the match
Haaland and Kevin, deadly duo. If Kevin provides 6 assists in 7 games, he can beat Henry's record.
Respect 🎉🎉🎉
💙💙💙
Haaland is a Playstation guy  And he got an injury this year
In City, every player is a STRIKER!!!
The new king of epl football 💙
Reigning champions
Vamos CityZens
Yny
Haland so impressive and its only his first season with city, pep and the system. Once he gels perfectly he will be unstoppable, except injuries.
Man City
Complete beast What a pen, what a finish As a City fan, missed this type of finishing last season
КБД красаучег, стабильно
Haaland is best in the world
I love haaland
sokmo laa tak cleansheet
Such a dominant team.. Damn
Холланд украинец ?
GREALISH = Goat Realish🔥
Pep made a bad decision
KDB and HALAAND are a bomb 💣.. i think they’ll win UCL
Mancity need Grace of God to UCl
Halland an Tia mi kha assist ah goal khung chiah thiam kha mi hepa hi 🤣🤣
any one who backs up glazers will hell pay glazers shud just take 5.5bn - 6bn and run do not buy united kits and not buy from sponsers till the glazers are gone turn off the taps manchester united fans
Stones 💪💙
Haaland should definitely be in the conversation for the Ballon D'or. If he can just help us win the Champion's League, I can see him being in the top three.
Was haaland subbed ? Because etto or ibra part 2 again
We are definitely winning the Prem.
What do we think fellow plastics!?
My team❤
Big Saloot City from indan fol bol Fans❤️
WHAT A WIN👑

If City wins UCL, Haaland deserves ballon dior

I know that some people like to hate on Grealish but you can see that he’s differently getting better!
Wallahi, we are finsihed!
Сити великолепны!❤
Urrraaaaaaaa!
Citih...citih....citih

Sóng sau xô sóng trước. Tôi thích Haaland❤
1-0 John Stones (5 min) 2-0 Erling Haaland (13 min (PK)) 3-0 Erling Haaland (25 min) 3-1 Kelichi Iheanacho (75 min)
FIFA forgets how spending power is buying Trophies 😂
De bruyne🎉
Haaland the best !
Haland is Monster!!
When you can't help but admire haaland is a gem💎 wish you well even though you are part of the noisy neighbors 🤗
The duo of kevin debryune and haaland will be criminally unfair in the next few years
LETS GOOOO we aint scared of nobody
glorious
Why does haaland not finish...he would score so many hatricks
Когда забивал Лестер, игрок опирался одной рукой об плечо игрока Сити, что бы выше прыгнуть. Это не нарушение?
Stone😮
I love this team
Krass
cool...
That's so so so amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Kdb and Haaland smashing records together.
Lucky haaland have kdb grealish .
Oh man Stones what a hit! 🔥⚽
What a ferocious strike by Stones, that was beautiful to watch. Come on City 💙

Haaland is cheat
An animal Guess who ?
Respect haaland❤ goooo ucl man city💙💙💙
Grealish man just do what you are doing real football fans know how beautiful your game is 🎉❤
scariest thing about haaland is he fast, tall, big, skillful and clinical. he can literally, heading, sprinting, bicycle kick, assisting, shooting outside the box, penalty, dribbling..
😮😮😮
Thankfully all the 4 goals of the game were scored by Man City players. It takes city players to score against city.
Beruntungnya city memiliki pemain seperti halan
Lethal 🔥 #city 💙
Haaland 2023>>>Mbappe 2023
Someone stop this guy from scoring 💯 😅
Porsvhtcarerra gt
Haaland isn't a human.😮
and the italian sayign but he cant play
And the blues are 3 points behind arsenal 🤣.... Punch line
Halaand the next cr7
😮😊
💙💙💙
Glory Glory Manu❤❤
haaland😊
Haaland without a doubt
Жаль Лестер
As a United fan, the few times I come here to watch highlights, I see how far United is from truly challenging for the League title.
As an Arsenal fan, I think we are still miles behind the quality of City. This is a well oiled machine.
ronaldo>>>>>>haaland
Kdb+stouns 👌🔥
The most consistent club in premier league and all of Europe.
Halland the killer
Halland the killer
No speech about Haland 🤖
Imagine messi kdb Haaland connection 🥵
ขอให้ Arsenal พลาดแพ้อีก 2 แมตช์ Man City เป็นแชมป์แน่นอน
Холанд гений
If you play...continues..like this..champion trophy..is gonna be on your hand...if it's true my prediction..call me baby...
Sme one shld help us and put this man Halland in a 4monthd injury 😊
Haaland for the d'or. C'mon!   His credentials will most likely be UCL, Prem, FA (treble), UEFA Supercup, 68 g/a, 58 goals (15 in UCL😮 & 40 in Prem🥵)
Want to see Haaland scoring 75 goals in all competition in a season someday
Woow this video got 1 million views in only 7 hrs
Ozil chip by Haaland🔥

Just 3 points difference between us and gunners💙
Why every time pep subs haaland
Goalaad
С победой
another record haaland 🎉🎉🎉
В одном интервью КДБ говорил о желании ирать с Кирштиану. Что он бы отдавал много голевых, а Роналду замыкал бы их. Тем самым у Кевина было бы очень много ассистов. А потом боженька отправил к нему Холланда.
John Stones and Michael Keane are goals of the month...
Gol santuy
The best team currently
Stone adalah mesin percobaan dari om Pep, dan itu berhasil
Erling Haaland💕💕💕
Iheanacho goal was just taken so calmly😮
there is no doubt he is a predator who is very fierce and thirsty for goals
cara halland mencetak gol seperti lg main fifa mode amatir gampang bgt bikin gol kegawang lawan 😅
So easy😅
Whether we win or lose Watching Halaand scoring is satisfying 😅
Haaland getting closer to the record
The only one that can stop Haaland is Pep himself
Man city gak ada obatnya....😂
The fact that we're in front of this machine is ridiculous. History in the making   Also I want to use this medium to appreciate Mrs Amanda Fuller kolbach for all the helped rendered to me so far!!... as of few months back my house was mortgaged but I can proudly say not ANYMORE!☺️☺️
This is our year💙
SiHaaland sulit di bendung
Earling Haaland it's New Pere Generation
Холанд монстр

City is coming. Arsenal  fans  especially  Robbie are warned.
Well yes, the first 25 minutes by the Blues were awesome .. the second half was dreadful.
Haland 🔥🔥🔥
man city squad are fantastic, i am bored look them win and win. i know man city have scandal. can they win champions league the first?
Stones....Grealish...Ake..Akanji... all become better and better
Come on City...We ready to be CHAMP AGAIN
Harland is a monster
🤍💙✌🏼
Vamos man city ❤️
udah kasih aja piala nya ke city lama
As an Arsenal fan, I am getting tiny bit anxious now 😂
City TREBLE WINNER This Years
doesn't ineacho remember that is his own team's goal 😁
Gilak sih Haaland ini ngeri bat tong, macam Terminator. HaalandNator

hallands first touch on that goal is obsurd
Bored look halland goal every game so easy😅
Haaland or Messi, they deserve ballon’s d or

Halland goes to persib 🔥
This result is a threat to Arsenal's trophy ambitions
Этот викинг опять забил
Haaland is such a joy to watch😍🤤
Si no lo cambiaran este tipo llega a los 130 goles en un año...
sebagai fans arsenal cuma fokus kepertandingan kita saja pasti juara🏆🏆🏆
Haaland should be very careful about how he took penalty, otherwise one day he will missed it
KDB

Congratulation

Agak bosen ya lama lama haland jadi monster
Haaland plays like robot 🤖
anyone’s gonna talk about our defence in the last 15 minutes
Haaland never stops scoring. Now imagine Messi, KDB and Haaland all playing for Manchester city next year and the manager is JP Guadiola.  EU sport shouldn't allow this.
Iheanacho, ex Man City? 😎
Не удивительно... Это же денежные мешки...
Happy Birthday Manchester CITY 🎊🎉🎂🎇🎆💙
Manchester city won’t win the premier league this season. But I’m kinda sure that they will win the champions league and maybe FA Cup too.
👍

Halland super. Big monster goal 😱👍🏻
Ndidi caused 2 goals... Injury has made my man a poor player
Haaland is a cow boy
No Body can stop Haaland
Come on, just three poins again
Haaland balond'or  incoming
How can Arsenal & Bayern get past through this unstoppable force
Halland monster
People saying arsenal deserve title. Fk them, if anyone who deserves a title is city, maintaining such a performance for week in week out for a decade or so. And saying city don't deserve it? We don't have to beat arsenal, they won't be able to handle pressure in coming fixtures
❤
Halland the next CR7
If Haaland learns to be more self-sufficient (before the city fans raise the pitchforks, remember when Fred pressed De Bruyne all game and City lost to United even with Haaland and De Bruyne on the pitch?), Mbappe's got some serious competition in the next generation.
Unstoppable halland
So bad that Calvin Phillips didnt accomodate, he was brilliant in Leeds, but in City is so slow.
Haaland set record just in his 1st season sheeshh
Stone in middle 🔥🔥✨👏
Pep shouldn't sub Haaland off!
City still needs Ronaldo
Guardiola has ability to improve avg player into beast.
Gilaakkk si haland...
Холланд, Де Брюйне, Стоунс, Пеп, МАН Сити ---- ЛУЧШИЕ!!!
Что бы он не сделал, то что творил Месси, это неповторимо для Холанда. Индивидуально с центра поля, фактически невозможно недля кого. А Месси это делал в каждый игре)
💙💙
Haaland haaaaland
bocah iki...😱😱😱
맨시티 오늘의승리를 축하드립니다.
I miss Iheanacho
Very good players Manchester City
City center back scoring stunner in the right goal. Meanwhile man utd center back scoring stunner in his own goal..😂
Behind Arsenal❤️🏆😁
Haaland ia predator gol. Good jin haaland
The City blues were fantastic.  Iheanacho, respectful.
That Iheanacho's tap in was cold😭😭🔥
Monster haland

That John Stones goals was beautiful! That Dortmund screamer and now this wow!
Haaland 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sorry Messi and Ronaldo. This guy is breaking all the records.
First Rodri now John Stones, weakfoot and a banger, what a goal! I'm expecting Dias next.
Indonesia
De Bruyne😮
Mamamia

O que é esse De Bruyne. Mizeravi!
32 premier Leaugue
City are just an OUTSTANDING team💙
KDB is class. pure blood football.
Playing football is too easy for haaland
Why is the speed settng 1.5x .
I’m glad Iheanacho’s name is on the title even though opponent’s scorer is normally not remarked here
Stones deserves that goal
Ман Сити-Реал Мадрид
Как же силен Haaland, просто терминатор )) Я не ожидал, что он будет так хорош в сильнейшем в мире чемпионате. Дай Бог ему здоровья, избави от травм!
if haaland is in front of the goal, then be careful, 90% will definitely score
Title videonya diganti ya? Perasaan tadi bukan yg kayak sekarang title videonya
鐵血籃兒, 笑裡藏🔪哈哈兒(哈蘭德)❕💙9⚽⚽
haaland > salah
홀란스럽다 ㄷㄷ
Its just my personal oppinion, but without messi, pep finally understand how to play modern 9 like haaland sublime with his strategies, in the past zlatan wasnt good enough to integrate with the system because messi is in his prime, and pep resolve his tactic around messi..  And yeah, its pretty scary what he can achieve with maximize haaland potential  Sorry for bad english
Haaland is a beast breaking records,Kdb phenomenal as always 💙💙💙🙌
King Haaland 🔥
Haland superduper 😂❤
Haaland
KDB is brilliant 💎
Say goodbye to your record salah 😂
Halah is Monster
You can only mesmerize at how fast pep tactical adaptibility is. After a few big buying he already have a new and better tactic to win everything. it mesmerizing to watch how the tactic evolve
Get rid of ndidi, useless waste of space. Week in week out he commits awful mistakes. Just get shut end of season.
Funny how this doesn't feel like a win... That 2nd half was horrendous. Resting some players for UCL is understandable but maybe not half of the team when we are also chasing a PL title and our opponents are trying to escape relegation no? We can't underestimate them, they are more hungry to win that game. Was confident in the first half and scared for life in the last 10mins.
Bener2 luar biasahh gogogogo kejar arsenal
Love these highlight videos, but PLEASE stop spoiling the score in the title/thumbnail. A sense of suspense for those who haven't watched the game is needed, and for those who know the score I promise they remember what happened.
8 more games..Arsenal may still be the EPL champ, given the fact they don’t have other major competition to strive for unlike City who have FA Cup and the ultimate prize CL to win 🏆
Stop that Stones
What has happened to Stones!!!🤯
If man city doesn't win the champions League with halland an de bryuna I don't know how they will win
🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖
KDB on his way for 20 league assist🤔
60% of people watched from india 😌
Good game keep it coming
HALLANDGOOD 😍😍😍
When you have a bad day just look at Jack Grealish‘s smile ❤
Balon d'Or. Winner HAALAND IF CITY WIN UCL ..BUT   corrupt FIFA will give it to somebody who just scored penalty in WC 😏😏😏😏
The City Players seem very motivated and focused on the big Prize this season🏆  Pep Guardiola restraining himself from "Overthinking" is a major blessing for the Team, Club and Fans😂
Crazy halaand ...   Thanks from indonesia
SI ALBINO SATU NI EMANG BENER BENER MONSTER SAAT INI

Haaland cheater :D MC ONE LOVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best game play....
😮
Makin menggila. Lanjutkan zens sampai juara
I'm so proud of man city this season, clearly show that they are looking forward on winning the premier league 💙💙🏆🏆
HALAND : WHY ALWAYS ME 😅
Haaland você tem a cara do Real Madrid
Dear man city fans Madrid is waiting for city in UCL. And benzi can't wait to prove who is the boss
Getting hot at the right time.
I have noticed that Haaland more often than not aims at either posts of the goal when taking penalty.  They went in most of the time.  I bet he practises it everyday to maintain that precisive execution.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
В этом году Сити возьмёт и АПЛ и лигу чемпионов однозначно. Это команда космос просто
Just haaland, haalanding around
Job done 👌🥰💙💙💙💙💙💙
Barnsley Busquets at his best🔥
Haland monster MC city
I'm feeling like haaland is playing nss in real life 😅
Да пашёл он....
De Bruyne weight of the past and haaland first touch as well as the finish. Outstanding!
Baratomeu prefirió al danés.....pfff
if Mancity can't win UCL this season, then Mancity would never win UCL.. don't know what player to buy anymore to win UCL if this team cant win this season
رمضان مبارك محرز
Up the blue ❤
thx iheanacho, im happy ederson lose cleansheet 😂
Lets go to Bayern to win Come on City💪🏽💙
City benar benar lagi super power
Quieran o no, Halaand será el próximo ídolo del fútbol. Amado por unos y odiados por otros, justo como debe de ser.
Halaand breaking record
Haaland benar-benar luar biasa 🇮🇩
Kdb +haaland=Goal 🎉
Happy birthday best team itw 💙👏🔥
Always Manchester city Fan  Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Subing him before him scoring a hattrick is absurd
I don't know city every game win
This Viking using a cheat engine
Haaland is the beast... what a scores
Haaland is a menace to society
sensational
positioning of haaland is insane , he can find out the gap between the crowd too and manage to control it with so much accuracy . There is no one like him in his posotion.
de bruyne x halland viking connection
City needs a new manager ...one who keeps his best players on till the match is done...esp when the title is at stake. Pep wants too much attention on himself... he's becoming a liability to the club.
El mejor jugador del mundo actualmente halaand
Салам из КЫРГЫЗСТАНА 🇰🇬
He still can't replace Aguero
Let’s go blues!!!
Bro just becoming Nunez after scoring a penalty 0:57
This Is Monster Haaland
Mbappe is Best, mbappe assit and goal
Last week rodri and now John stones wonder goal
As a united fan,makes me cry to see how many goals city scores every game,every week..
Halaand is a superb club player
KDB's assist and Haaland's goal is a never ending love story
Halland is machine
Stones hitting wonder goals this season
Haaland mancity
Are you telling me Pickford better than Ramsey? Or Maguire better than White? seriously though!
gacorr
Halland bukan pemain sepak bola tapi dia seorang mesin pembuat goal
My team💙
Cv
haaland beat salah record Salah: 31 goals  Haaland: 32 goals
블루는 언제나 옳다!!
Come on CETIH 💙
I think stones is so underated
Don't stop, keep attack!!!
What a goal by stones
Woooo... GO city... GO city..
Stones snatched that volley like a 9
JOHN STONE'S UNDERRATED 💙🔥
MAN CITY 💙 2nd HALF once subs where made I was a bit worried ,city nearly blew there victory🤨
if a defender scores a goal from open play you know it's gonna be a banger
My pun Haaland😂
The only person who can stop haaland is guardiola
It all became super boring to watch when K. Phillips, Palmer and Gomez came in 🫤😴🤥  I feel like they are not needed in the team.
Luar biasa man city
Sigh 🥲
Haaland the robot
Need rodri sub, ASAP
Jeez, comment section, its HAALAND, not Halland.. Just like its not Mesi, Roonaldo or Bappy..
Haaland is the monsters😮😮😮
Arsenal terancam dilengserkan 😂😂😂
Super KDB & Haaland, 👏🏻👏🏻
The toughest league in the world becomes a farmer league for Haaland.
Kuron x isagi
He can’t stop scoring
Grealish is on fire
Mantap gak sia2 semalam nonton:)
Haalånd is a monster
MC 9 VS RM 9 FINAL UCL 2022/2023 .
That hand ball is absolutely bollocks when the same thing happened for arsenal against Newcastle no pen
Monsterr
At this rate, Haaland is in route of being the best players that ever played, incredible rythm he has, hope he stays healthy to enjoy his impressive performances.
Man city is so strong
Phillips🤦🏽‍♂️
Artificial intelligence will take over humanity, and right in the middle of the bloodiest combat of the war we will wage against the degenerate machines, I will still be wondering what the hell Wout Faes was doing in the play of City's third goal 😂
Kloc
Haaland like a monster
❤❤❤🇩🇿🇩🇿
Top
Pep at it as usual subbing Haaland off when he’s closing in on another hattrick, once again showing he’s biased asf too pessi and don’t want Haaland too break his records and win the ballond’or this year  Did it when he was close too breaking pessis 5 goals in a CL game when he faced Leipzig and now today aswell 😂  Well Haaland is the best player in the world by far this year and definitely deserves the ballond’or 👑
second half was bad idk phillips isnt good enough tbf
it's beautiful to see man city play, I'm cheering your team to be the champions winner!
Watch out leaders
Hoping to see Haaland in Madrid next year.
💙❤️
If you don't win the CL this year with this team you never will.. .
The world's best striker any doubter take a hike.
Here in Africa we call Haaland a "principle" what do you call him in your continent??😊
Halland vai ser o maior.goleador. Do futebol mundial de todos os tempos 😎
Haaland is so good
Halland is hoal machin
Halland halland
I’m so pleased for Stones. What a goal, what a season for him.
Funny how john stones might actually be a potential CDM replacement alongside rodri
What was Phillips doing there
Those are three good goals but that one from Stones is not a defender finish but more of one with a strikers instinct and quality
🤖🤖
I love them very much KDB and all city players  Bravo!❤
Man City = cheating
Halaand like A machine goal
Phillips...... my god man.
Has haaland ever not scored in a match
again halaand continues to score goals
I hope city wins CL..And Belgium wins wc
Damn........ This match is fire
Team- city goal goal goal🙈⚽⚽⚽⚽✊
Amaizing halland
Semakin dekat rebut puncaknya 👍
I cannot stand this haaland fella, hes making top European football look like PE.
Robot halands again
Greaslish ❤
Great Game From City And The Goal Machine Erling Haaland 👊👊👊👏, Really Well Deserved Win 👊

City don't give penalty to haaland in champion league pls he will lose it
Haaland  globe trotters

Yeees
It's amazing: haland's 32 premiere league goal 😀😀👍👍

Isnt ihenacho a former citizen as well?
MAHREZ👑 👏👏
Sign  James Maddison Please... Come on City

👍👍 Aku Yakin Sekali Jika Manchester City Mampu Juara Liga Inggris Kembali
Haaland to score 40 goals in the premier league
Halaand's last second coolminded tactics are "Messi-like!" Not to mention his ever effective unorthodoxedly great shot selections put him 1st in my balondor for next year. Messi world cup etc may clinch. But this guy is a must watch...
Mcity gokilll
unstoppable wow
History in the making... 🔥
But real Madrid will beat them again ….it’s what It is  Real Are just better

VAMOS CITY 🩵🩵🩵💪💪💪 Y HAY QUE GANAR LA VUELTA EN MUNICH.
Btw the 1st and 3rd goals are my favorite 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ⚽️🏆🥇
Halland is the best player in the entire planet!
WTF Happened to us in the 2nd half better not bring that energy to Munich or we getting chewed and spit right out.
You are very late with highlights, please do better
THIS IS OUR YEAR. COME ON CITY
Lovely game but I really hate the fact how immensely fanatic Rodri ran towards the referee asking for a penalty. Imo players should get fined for behaviour like that. They don’t need that, they’re playing the best football in the world right now. You’re 1-0 up against an almost relegated team, come on lad you’re better than that
It's peace to be a City fan
Whew!! City ALMOST did a Man Utd(v Sevilla) in the 2nd-half....
ประตูของสโตนส์ยอดเยี่ยมมาก💙⚽️🔥
The fact that we are infront of this machine team is ridiculous and borderline miracle
Vamos city
ฮาแลนด์บ้าไปแล้ว💙💙💙⚽️⚽️⚽️
Haaland Unstoppable😦
Haland sadis
Title race 🏃 🏁
Haland lagi dan lagi😮
Haaland > Mbappe
Together Champions again✊🔥
¡Sexo Haaland!
El T 1000 lo volvió hacer, es más poderoso que el T 850 (Arnold) y más letal por supuesto y eso que Skynet fue destruida ya hace más de 20 años.....
King
love u men❤city
It's only a matter of time city will win it
Arsenal champion 😈😏
MY LOVE ERLING HOLLAND❤❤
Take a bow our Barnsley lad John Stones 👏🙌. What a beautiful goal for Manchester City.
Ederson saved us 😢
There is something about de bruyne running into space that gives me a feeling that a goal is coming....
Que sería de este monstruo si el vendehumos de Guardiola lo dejara jugar los partidos completos.
Lagi lagi Haaland
Rodri is so so so so important to this team, wow. People say Arsenal have a huge drop-off when Partey is unavailable, I'd say we have a bigger drop-off. Kalvin is waaaay off it, it's literally like playing with a pedestrian in the team.
MAN CITY had me worried towards the end of the GAME,  come on lads few subs where made for you to hold the game threw 🤨
no way arsenal gonna win premier league❤❤❤❤❤
Es un bárbaro para definir
gilak siti😊
God willing we are going to be the best... congratulations team cityzen 💙💙 for life
Went to the tour yesterday nearly saw them all train! Love man city 💙
Was this filmed by a toaster?
Banger 🔥
Haaland e uma força da natureza.
My mate reckons Haaland will score 15 more this season. How many has sterling scored ??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂no more tap ins for that clown fool
Who will get more goals this season:  Erling Haaland or Chelsea Football Club?
N deedy.. hand bally
Greet Halaand
I'll have what Stones is having please.
100 assists for kdb is crazy. you have to make 10 assists for 10 straight years to get to 100.
Nice
T+
Like, how many hat-tricks Haaland missed this season?
Some of our bench players are very bad they nearly cost us the game 2nd half.
dedurny and haaland are best ❤❤❤❤
هذا ملخص حقيقي احنه العرب نفتقد هيك ملخصات حلوه
Thus my team
Phillips is terrible
Just stop already haaland please 😭
Halland is a gem
KDB and Haaland are beasts!!!
Halland c est du regale ce gamin de l autre cote on nous chante et timpanise avec un sprinter dans un championnat 6 em en europe derriere le portugal et quand il marque contre des canari ou des bretonne il est me meilleur joueur du monde.le ridicule ne tue pas
Everyone scoring like crazy . Rodri now stones
De Bruyne tenang banget kalo striker nya halland
Halland durdurulamaz bu goat

Perfect matching in the world: Kevin and Haaland!!!! 🎉🎉 i am a reallybif fan of Real Madrid but i hope City will get the UCL this year.. they just love football and playing as a team 😁😁👏👏

Superb

The first half was entertaining, the second half was devastating
Grealish is back to his Aston villa form imo.... his dribbling to beat a man confidence is back and is trouble for any defender now plus goals n assists as bonus
Please become PL champions this season 👏🏼
hii,i from indonesia
Haaland 🔵 🔥
Can't see Man City losing a single game from here on out.
Arsenal will win the title
Haland is monsterr...,,  good joob brother
Ga wajar anjir HALLAND DE BRUYNE

Closing gap! City were saying that all season. Closing gap. Arsenal is great.
Robottttt
Que grande eres Haaland
Haaland no good player
Pep Guardiola is subbing Haaland after half time Or so, not letting him complete his hat-trick. This is too cruel.
The blue's title no danger
It's so Amazon for Halland
Halland
Ever made your players on Fifa all 99 rated? That first half had that feeling.
Kevin De Bruyne and Haalland combination perfect in football 💯
subuh subuh gini min
Halland is monster👹
Whats wrong with vardy?
KDB ❤❤❤
City is doing amazing city fans pray for city to win the epl and pray to whatever you believe in for arsenal to lose because i hate arsenal and want city to win all the freaking way.
very poor quality
HOLLAND MONSTER👹👹👹👹👹👹
That Haaland penalty was mad. If the shot was a little more centered towards the keeper, he would have missed. Thats crazy.
we're man city and we're massive!
1.10 beyond what ? umdidi ok
Maguire = philips
Ngerii lur
Semudah inikah epl bagi halland
Stones❤
Class
Love love 😍😍😍😍
Keep it going Citizens 💠🥵  Haters gon cry hard it's treble coming...
who would be able to stop Stones? He's brilliant
This Pep’s 3-2-4-1 on 🔥
this halland guy is just stupid gooood
Omg
I like it when says level up with Mo.Salah. But I'm sure Mo.Salah is best .
Naiseu derisogood
Great
Haaland equals the PL Record! Congratulations Erling ❤❤❤
No one can stop Haaland ‼️
Imagine De Bruyne in Real Madrid when Ronaldo was playing for Real Madrid. De Bruyne would have 500 assists for Real Madrid by now. What a legend De Buyne is
Recognize at ManC's third goal how Haaland reveals his qualities: He did not want to interfere with his teammate, but when he chose a less optimal run, Haaland immediately hurried for the best - and realize how clinical accurate his touches are!  ... when Haaland is off the pitch, ManC have difficulties scoring goals - de Bruyne has no one to pass to ...
God bless Haaland
What a finish from Haaland on the 3-0! Big chip shot!
🎉🎉😊😊
Cakep
haaland = jack the robot of tekken
Haland is definitely gonna break all the records of club goals one day 👍
Unstoppable Haaland 🔥🔥
Erling "Monster" Haaland
Mantap Jiwa+Kopi.
The second goal of Haaland was a brilliant finish and not just a tap in. Stones scored a great goal too, especially for a defender

Had Haaland stayed the whole match, he would have probably scored hattrick again
"but can he do it in Prem?"
Haaland has great vision and speed but clearly the rb could’ve done better
1-0 Stones 2-0 Haaland (P) 3-0 Haaland 3-1 Iheanacho
Seguir
Kalvin out!!
Hallaand,, Match 30,, Gol 32,, Amazing,,
3 points clear. Way to go! 💙
3 points behind Arsenal. Let's goooo
🔥🔥🔥
Like second goal it looks easy only for halland others striker won score
That gap statement was not necessary...ARSENAL WE THE CHAMPIONSHIP
Who needs Haaland when you have Haaland.
Waagilasehh gas terus menuju top 1
Haaland's goal at premier league is better than his match...😮 And it' s same at UCL...😐
Predator Haaland 🔥
Haaland = cheat code 😂
Man city fans 🇮🇩
Pep keeps bringing haarland off early before he can get hat tricks
Sebelum nya saya bukan penggemar city,, tpi setelah halland main di city sya jdi suka..

Off course, the monster 👾 Haaland score again 👹😱😃.
Stones🔥
De Bruyne and Halaand combo is always lethal! 🔥💯
GOAT 🧘
Clear handsball and this ref need var to decide, really????
Stones' goal gives me "Vinny don't shoot" vibe!!!
Funny how they went straight to Var after the ndidi handball but just said "yea its fine move on, say you checked it so we dont get in trouble" on the Gomez handball..........You lucky citizens
I hate Haaland
I feel sorry for bayern at home 😂😂😅
KDB,maestro assist...stone on-fire
Love Sheikh Mansour and his family.  His half brother lit the testes on fire on a peasant who ripped him off in a business deal. He then drove over him lol. Mansour has 2 wives. Legends. Glad to see his family embraced by the West. Great role models for my sons.
❤
Kalvin Phillips cost us the clean sheet
This game felt like a fever dream
It's like we're cheating just by using Haaland.
Man city is an unstoppable force
doesnt this mean haaland is tied with salah's goal scoring record?
Second half was unacceptable
Haaland is currently farming the English premier league 🤣
Guardiola wont let Haaland score more goals than his favorite player, messi.
Arsenal chance of winning the title isn't a easy thing...
Erling selalu lapar Goal
WHO WILL STOP HAALAND😮
Haaland's movement and positioning is the best in the world
Arsenal fans rn 😥😟
Haaland be playing career mode ngl
City the champion
halland two goal againt
Halland monster
City really need more goals like  Stones or Rodri these last 2 match  it help when we can't able to penetrate their wall of people
Unstoppable Haland
Moonster haland
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nah cause If I was Haaland I would be pissed. Imagine being one goal away from breaking 2 records and your coach subs you off at HALF TIME☠️
A monster Haalans
Semoga tetap konsisten Dan menjadi Juara 🔥🔥🏆

Stones' goal was absolutely wonderful.
If I was new to watching football and someone told me Stones is a striker I would maybe believe it.
Haaland 🥶
Stones + Haaaland
He broke salah's 2018 record
I'm tired of Pep subbing off Haaland when he's about to break another record. He could have made two new records today. 1 in getting more goals than Salah, which he eventually will. The other, which is much more difficult, which is to get 5 hat-tricks in one PL season like Shearer. And it's not like the first time this  season he has subbed him from breaking records. I don't care if he wanted to rest him for the Bayern game. That game is already won. City is leading 3-0. Alvarez can play it. To be honest, Alvarez should play as much as Haaland. He's too good to be a sub. They should work as a pair up front every game.
Yeah now let's destroy Bayern and Real Madrid
Fantastic player..  King Halland.. 🎉🎉🎉
Great performance, but Iheanacho's goal was the best lol
King Haaland 🫡

Very good first half from the team, as per usual the likes of Rodri, KDB, Haaland & Grealish are doing wonders for us. As good of a thought it might be from Pep to rotate the squad as much as possible in the second half after we were leading 3-0, it could've easily cost us though, for some reason the players seemed lost on the pitch in the last 20-25 min of the match, it shouldn't happen. Now time to focus on Wednesday for us to get past Bayern Munich and keep fighting for the treble. Come on City 💙
Halland next lord ibra
