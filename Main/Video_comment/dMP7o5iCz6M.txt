"What's the WiFi password?" "It's Mrs. D. Mrs. I. Mrs. FFI. Mrs. C. Mrs. U. Mrs. LTY."
Reminds me of a 3 Stooges joke. Larry: "Let me in when I give the password." Moe: "What's the password?" Larry: "Open the door." *SMACK*
So the password is Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT

My home wifi password is simple. But due to the way things are set up, DHCP refuses to work so you need to manually set up IP ,mask, and gateway as well as DNS. That’s what gets our guests much more so than the password which is only 10 digits!😂
Default hotspot passwords be like:
Just use WPS..

Ok but uppercase nine is not six-

Why would you not capitalise the N in Nebraska though? So unreasonable. He has only himself to blame! 😂
I didn't know they made this video. But I recently set up a new wifi with a 30 digit password just to amuse myself and annoy others. This is ironic AF. They also got me beat with like 42 digits
Thanks I'd rather use my data.
This reminds me of my stepson’s passwords. The first one was impossibly long and convoluted, while the second one had something along the lines of “and only my password” at the end of it. Give me a break!

"WHY YOU JUST SAY THAT NOW?!" "I didn't tell you?" "NO!" And back from the start! Yeay and sorry to them who line-up behind us.

Lol, I immediately wondered if it needed capitalized or not
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT
Im gonna use this
No joke I was wondering if Nebraska was capitalized since he mentioned it 😆
You look like Tony Stark when you scream
The way he said did you capitalize the N in Nebraska like mermaid man said did you press W for Wumbo 🤣
You know you can always scan it up
This is how my brother reacted when I told him my wifi password was 2158851215755137515 (I'm not joking, that's actually my wifi password, and my phone password)

BTW, you can link the wifi by QRcode now, just ask him to give you the QRcode. (*¯︶¯*)
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT
And here I thought we got creative when my brother kept breaking into the wifi while grounded. Kept asking for the password. All he got was 'No Sean's for an answer. He figured out after twenty times of repeating that it was the password
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT

I fricken died at the end. His scream was perfect

Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat’sitANDTHATSIT
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE N IN NEBRASKA
I memorized a 27 character long number, I will now proceed to use it as a password because try hacking me now hoes.

They set this up so well cause I wouldve asked if the N was capital in Nebraska myself lmao.

Immediately after he said Nebraska internally I was like 'wait is the N capitalized?"
Just share it with the damn qr or press the wps button.

Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT is my new password
Protip: If someone really has this ridiculous password, or alike, just take their phone, and scan the QR code under the wifi name to connect.
Why not just QR the password?
I live in Nebraska
so is the password "QsevenfiveptwelveupsidedownsixHhHhNebraskauppercasetwoupsidedowneightandthat'sitANDTHATSIT"? or "Q75p12upsidedown6HhHhNebraskauppercase2upsidedown8andthat'sitADNTHATSIT"?

OH MY GAWD I HAVMT SEEN YALL IN SO LONG
Just scan the dammn qr code it's on every modern phone now
The pain was entering a 64 character wifi password on an Xbox controller as a kid. I know this pain.... Always had to do it 3 times.
Meanwhile the people with qr scans or knows about wps:
My Wi-Fi password is quite literally a geometric equation
When he asked, "did you capitalize the "n"  in Nebraska" he shouldn't have said , " yes i did". Then he should have been like ,"that's where you went wrong".
I had a feeling it was something to do with Nebraska
Long Password 🤣
lol I went to a friends house and it was 26 2s, took like 6 tries and they had all sorts of stories about it.  22222222222222222222222222   I think that’s it😂
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat’sitANDTHATSIT
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT is the password
My father had a 64 digit wifi password for a while. Playing switch sucked
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT
Umm, these is QR code for logging in nowadays grandpa
I knew the N would be capital lmaooo i was like "its a place, don't forget to capitalize it" and an his nose got red!
It's FOUR WORDS ALL UPPERCASE except its one word all lowercase.
I knew Nebraska would come back lol
Quite strong password
You think this is bad, but we use a random 64 bit password. Its hell. Dont ever visit  (One of my parents used to work for the state in tech security, so that's why we have it)
And you after all that typing, you realized that most phones can scan the WiFi qr code
I KNEW IT THE "N" IN NEBRASKA
My mind was on that capitalizing Nebraska too. I was like… technically you should capitalize it right?
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat’sitANDTHATSIT

Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat’sitANDTHATSIT
Just have it written down?
Thank you for the idea
Wifi has a passowrd limit of 16 or something odd char
And that's why folks Google added the scan QR to connect to the wifi.
can some one checked if 127 letters are used ?
Come on, Link! You should have known to capitalize Nebraska.
Then after 20 minutes of trying you just go “can you share it to me” and it’s over in 20 seconds
The ending was the best conclusion

Good thing I use QR codes to connect to wifi lol

This made me laugh SO BAD Xd
Or simply you can make it into a qr code and scan. it it really that shit nowday that you can scan the wifi password
Link's scream is a perfectly relatable reaction to life these days.
😆👍Link lost his sh☆t
Can those saying they stole this bit from Rocketjump leave them alone?
This should have 120 million views already.
Invalid password hurts so much
I agree! lol having long WiFi passwords are so frustrating! 😣
That is a long long long password.
Lmao whose idea was this I love it
How’d you know my password…?
😅 LOL

I really enjoy the shirts and sweaters that Rhett wears. Or I just like ocean creatures. ❤ 🐙

Q75p126HhHhnebraska28andthat’sitANDTHATSIT is the password
Feels like my neighbors password.
YOU ASKED FOR THIS
I KNEW NEBRASKA WOULD COME BACK INTO PLAY 😂😂
This is why there is a share option in the wifi settings 😂
Immediately after he said Nebraska and Link didn’t clarify if it was uppercase I knew it was coming lol
That IS a very long password… poor Link at the end there
I'm coming to use your internet lol
I wonder if they realize (because they ate older) that iPhone can share passwords via Bluetooth now.
Sounds like one of the passwords I made up for my mom. Pretty sure she's still mad at me!
Links scream at the end! 🤣
Wow.  Yeah.  That be me.
Always capitalize proper nouns.
Omg yes. I feel Links pain. I think the worst is when they have you make a new password that needs to have 1 upper case letter, 1 lower case letter, 1 number, 1 drop of blood, 1 thumb print, 1 first born child, 1 arm, 1 leg, can’t have been used in the past 5 years, can’t be in numerical or alphabetical order

Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT  You're welcome
Calm down
ANDTHATSIT 😂
My first thought when he said Nebraska was "You better capitalize that!"
I realized that Rhett and Link think of themselves as  "I and Link'' and ''Rhett and I'' respectively. ( Not related to the video, just a thought that came into my mind )
Who wouldn't know to capitalize Nebraska?
They stole this from Rocket Jump or whatever the channel name is. Saw them do it years ago and I absolutely couldn't figure it out lmao
Long wifi passwords are the worst I feel you link
Lol😆💜👍
Link's scream at the end was good
Q75p126HhHhNebraska28andthat'sitANDTHATSIT
