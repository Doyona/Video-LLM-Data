Santa Claus es tengo labubu elfos y duende mi aretes
Tengo murciélago 🦇🦇🦇,mi monja
Shadow heart!!!!
1:54 belisemo
So what's the deal with the naughty "Santa"? 🤔 Is he some sort of disguised monster actually? :o
Wyll. My Guy.
0:16 Geoff Peterson 😆
0:36 when my mum calls me down from gaming for tea, and it’s not even ready yet
Phandelver hardcore boys? Young Tommy? He’s just a little guy!
I randomly say thanks for the most beautiful and thoughtful Soundtrack, like ever! Ican stay like forever in the battle with Raphael! You absolutely hit the spot!  thank you very much!  It's a delight to play your game...haven't had that much fun in a while. thanks
I mean…we don’t know how long the guy was up there. He could’ve had to do that to survive and wasn’t just luring travelers up there.
It's a shame there's no enforcer helmet in the game. It's not Larian!
0:35 I felt this in my soul
I have a question....IS THAT ELF SANTA OR SANTA'S COUSIN?!
Я кажется знаю почему ГГ зовут Tav, они просто взяли первые три буквы от Taverna 😄❤
0:59 Shadowheart snuggling up to Karlach is both hilarious and adorable. So is shivering Astarion because he has no body heat, poor Astarion lol.
I love Laezel in these shorts.. OMG shes so funny.
Astarion's feeling pretty in fur, Lae'zel randomly licking things and Karlach biting through cords.. swear it's like campaigning with a bunch of cats😂
Juuuuust realized the window at the front of the tavern is the XBOX controller hookup light.
STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING
I love the Cameo from the IO verse in the first 10 seconds with the hardcore mines of fandelver party sitting at the tavern on the left side
“My Enemies head preserved in a jar” 😝  Her eyes got so wide it was adorable.
I’m assuming the Dark Urge is still in the tavern just knitting the hell out of whatever yarn he’s using
i love how Lae'zel  is just watching Karlach sinking in the snow like you good?
🤣 poor shit box scrubs took so long as usual to get this....
MIZORA IM DEAD
omg, i knew the animation was familiar with how karlach eyes were drawn
I was just watching the newest one, I didn’t realize they’ve always made shad gay for karlach
Larian studios I love you for this game
lol poor cold astarion 😂
Just discovered these and I’m just happy that Geoff has a home in Baldur’s Gate as well.
Just realizing now that Santa's a drow xD
Is that a Geoff Pedersen reference?
I didnt even know Gale eating your shoes was a thing the first time i gave out about it online
Awwww
Now that we know Swen's potency with bees:  How in the fresh hell did Astarion get his hands on that?!?
0:09 Io
1:53 No need to elaborate
I love how Karlach just bit the cable. She's also adorable.
this cartoon cracks me up🤣🤣
That heal better have only been like 6 hp
I love this so much
Love it!
Jeff
Karlach will forever be Perfect
If Wyll doesn't want it I will take it.
1:40 Hey!!!, Wyll is stealing my gift
Geoff!  I half-expected Josh Robert Thompson to suddenly voice that skeleton 😄
영어를 모르는데도 알아듣겠네. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I never noticed the different numbers for the roll initiative! That's so cool!
Love from a DoobusGoobus and Vaush fan!
Sonic, Amy, Knuckles, and Tails at the beginning! Love that little addition
Omg! Astarion's "oh for  fucks sake!" Gets me. Every. Single. Time 😂😂 Sums Astarion up in less than 5 works 😂
You created that feminist ... supremacist in dragon commander. More than 10 years, and i must say, you did good. I will never buy one of your games. I have no money for it. I will always be more concerned for survival.  I never felt more free in any other game (except FTL). To say thank you feels inadiquate.. But sometimes feeling take over what you know. And you get Baldurs Gate 3  Rock on.
I am LOVING these shorts! But wait a moment... is this 0:18 a Paul Rudd in hot ones reference? lmao i love it hahah
Astarion being cold is so hilarious since he's undead
1:40 thats all I want for Christmas 😭
Animated series please
the thing i dont understand about Astarion. if he is invisible in the mirror, how can he maintain his gorgeous hair?
Appreciate it for posting! Hoping for some advice: My Crypto Wallet contains some USDT TRX20, and I have the recovery phrase: -clean- -party- -soccer- -advance- -audit- -clean- -evil- -finish -tonight- -involve- -whip- -action-. What’s the best way should I go about moving them to my Binance account?
0:16 is that Geoff from The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson
Is, Is that geoff from the late late show with Craig Ferguson?
OMG this is so funny!!!!!!!!
1:32 ik this was aready pointed out, but Astarion & Lae'zel being the only ones who look skeptical is sending me 😭😭
HOLY CRAP IS THAT TOMMY FROM THE LOST MINES OF PHANFELVER!!!! 0:09
This feels like Teen Titans Go, but I would actually watch this show.❤
Initiative rolls: Gale - 12 Shads - 16 Lae'zel - 16 Astarion - 20 Karlach - 15 Wyll - 13  Checks out.
I love these shorts. This should be a netflix series or something. Legit 24 min episodes. Karlac the best animated character.
These type of animations always have easter eggs so i paused on the first frame inside the tavern and well... is that sonic? guy with blue hair, then tails to his right (small all yellow clothing and a part of the jacket looks like a tail), then amy to his other side everything in her color scheme is right there and then knuckles just chilling. It is them isnt it??? Idk if any other of the tavern patrons are other references but that group caught my eye ahah
Lae'zel speaking in such a menacing tone with such adorable expressions is what I need rn.
My gods, this was beautiful!  More, please!
Oh my god. I must have more of this as an actual animated series. This was pure comedic gold 😅.
I saved this video before I knew who any of them were, now I’m a certified karlach simp
"Don't even think about licking it."
honestly speaking I need 8 seasons of this
I would watch a full animated series loke this for sure!
Astarion being freezing more than the others since he's undead and technically has no warm blood is a hilarious detail I just got.
She lickt it
"My enemies head preserved in a jar! Geooooff" 😂
Ohh I love this as much as I love gale😭
Please make more of these.
So many things in this animation just got me dying...  -Gale eating boots -Karlach just melting all the snow around her while Astarion and Shadowheart huddle around her for warmth. -Astarion and Lae'zel not impressed with the bag -Karlach's "true heart's" desire -Shadowheart literally about to lose her lunch at the sight of the carnage. -"My enemy's head preserved in a jar!" -Karlach going chomp on the cord -Lae'zel not even flinching at the sight of a Mind Flayer, but huddling close to Gale in absolute terror of this "mysterious box" -And of course...Astarion just being Astarion...  This is so silly, but also just the peak D&D experience. You expect epic adventures, but all you get is tomfoolery. LOVE IT!
Love it. Did you work with Genndy Tartakovsky on this?
I love how Karlach was low key thirsty for Mizora.
i keep coming back to this because of the tiny tara. she’s so babi
0:59 Not Astarion using Karlach as a warm stove 😂 This is HILARIOUS!
I hope they do another animated short this year, these are so good.
Studios embracing their fandoms memes (Gale EATING magical items) forever make those like Larian stand out among the rough
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen! 😍 I love Shadowheart snuggling up with Karlach for warmth 🥺
Another… mysterious box? Don’t even THINK about licking it. *licking sounds*  Stop😧 *more licking sounds* No don’t- 😥 *even more licking sounds*  Stop that! 😠
Is the Skeleton named Geoff a shoutout to VLDL?
I love BG3 ❤ thank you for this game …
Makes me wish there was a snow envirment in game
I don’t see Veilguard having an animated short sponsoring their acclaimed rival to Baldur’s Gate in a festive theme. Because it’s ashamed to admit it.
this would be the best animated series , i would watch 4 seasons and a movie
INITATIVE
Astarion having the absolute WORST time because he has no body heat while Karlach is an unbothered queen with ALL the body heat is peak comedy and attention to detail
I admit I'm really slow on the uptake, I finally got the Geoff the skeleton reference.
Huh. Never seen a fat elf before.  Ah. That's why. So do you suppose Gnome tastes the same as human? I'm sure there's a bit of lore somewhere of a Vampire or something comparing the different races, that really sounds like the kind of joke I'd expect here.
The animation just too cute!
I love this
Wonderful!
All this production, all the animation, all the voice acting…  And the main character is still a frakking mute.
0:19 so it's official
2:03 everyone's just fooling around, while laezel is so dramatically serious 😂😂😂
I shudder to think what Durge would have pulled out of the sack
0:28 The fact he drank the swen vincke blood (aka) (the video game designer of balder’s gate 3) on that bottle.       Props to him and the team! ❤️
btw sonic as a DND party was so cool 0:08 table at the back
3:07 somebody tell Karlach she is not a cat
😂😂😂 Astarion is a dead cold-blooded vampire, so he gets cold faster than others and Karlach can't help melting snow, because she is a burning hottie, I love these details
Ok, so when's the new series coming out? Don't tease, we need this the news hasn't been the best lately don't hurt us more.
Shadowheart cuddling next to Karlach 😊
2:57 Just now realizing Gale tells Lae'zel not to lick the x-box and keeps whining at her as she apparently savors it like a popsicle
I like the idea that will present was a very sexy mazorra picture
Shadow heart is adorable in this
The best Christmas gift would be Larian saying "sike we've actually been working on a DLC"
1:40 would have been Minthara for me but -Lohse- Mizora is great too.
Everytime I look at gale i just See Obi wan Kenobi from the old clone wars TV show
I would kill for a whole show's worth of these <3
Make this a streaming series.
THE SPIDER LICKING REFERENCE HELL YEAH
1:54  LORD HAVE MERCY.
Kinda sad there isnt a snow section on the game
Greatest game ever made by the greatest dev company ever... thank you so much
0:39 You can actually see bites taken out of Gale's boots
Infernal Engine Oil LMFAO. I don't know what I was expecting going into this but it I definitely didn't expect this. Worth every second.
0:08 Omg... the hardcore phandelvor survivors!
1:41 ik wyll only got mad at us because he wanted mizora himself
These animated shorts are brilliant, please make more!!
Karlach calling herself daddy is enough to cure me.
It’s 🎅
0:24 oh my god i might turn gay for this man’s voice
Amen to those who's playing BG3 on playstation & xbox.
Can we talk about Wyll and that Mizora's picture?
"Oh, what." I say the exact same thing quite often actually.
lmao shadowheart healing karlach at the end
THANK YOU LARIAN FOR THE ABSOLUTE DIVINE WORK.
i quote astarions "oh for fuck sake" at least 3 times a day... and i have since this came out... still obsessed.
Engagement
ejem shadowheart has a wrong hair color....wtf?
Shadowheart's hair is silver in this animation
I would so watch this if it was a series it's screaming adult swim.
how did i not know about this
Makes me wish we had a snowy area for Karlach
I so deeply want a full series of these they are so fun snd full of personality while somehow remaining faithful to the actual characters somehow, and on top of that acknowledging how the fanbase sees this characters,(gale eats magical items and will is actually in a toxic relation)
Oh my godbits the lost mines of phandelver hardcore crew. Holy cow what an awesome cameo
Обожаю партийные рпг!
Love how Wyll pulled out a sexy picture of Mizora 😂😂😂
"That's a bit extreme, even for me" You'd let a girl be bit by a viper, torture a man to the brink of death, and wish to be decapitated...yet your cap is a bunch of chopped up gnomes? You don't even like gnomes, Astarion!
Just waiting for them to bring bing bong into these
Spotted the Hardcore Phandelver gang in the wide shot!
I just realized. When Gale tells Lae'zel not to lick the Xbox, is that a reference to licking the dead spider? 😂 Also, I adore how Wyll checks on Karlach after she passes out from biting the cord. 🥰
Gale with the boot had me for 5 minutes straight.
0:09 there’s World of Io’s hardcore Lost Mines of Phandelver party, they even have Turg’s hideous bald rat face covered by a paper bag!
Vivian Inlet
Was waiting for gale to say STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING at the end there
Now this is what i call marketing
Gonzalez Margaret Miller Larry Smith John
Neil Armstrong is pure magic…darling
Karlach is Daddy confirmed
01:44 catgirl Karlach
Karlach is bae
Hammes Stream
I would like 10 seasons and a movie length finale, pls and thnku
Garcia Sharon Taylor Margaret Martinez Anna
0:36 - this alone is worth a couple awards for Neil! Absolutely killed me!
Shadowhearts expressions were adorable
Leon Streets
Moore Brenda Garcia Timothy Gonzalez George
Lewis Jeffrey Moore Barbara Lee Jessica
"Come to daddy" Cuz Karlach calling herself mommy would've broken the internet.
I never noticed Shadowheart nuzzling Karlach for heat.
It feels like if Battlefield Friends was official
Warhammer made by larian studios, PLEASE!
"This is a bit much, even for me."   Bro if *Astarion* says that, you *better* roll initiative.
Wyman Meadow
Larian Will your new games also be LGBT-friendly? If so, then you disappointed me
Larian Will your new games also be LGBT-friendly? If so, then you disappointed me
Larian Will your new games also be LGBT-friendly? If so, then you disappointed me
Larian Will your new games also be LGBT-friendly? If so, then you disappointed me
Whose soul do I need to sacrifice to get a full animated show of Baldurs Gate???
1:40 that's a little disturbing.
Larian, I never asked anything to you.  Please create a mode where we can create our own RPG adventure (like the Game master mode in Divinity). It could be a DLC...then this game will, for sure, be played forever!!!
WHO IS GEOFF
These might be the best piece of promotional material since Meet The Team
I am very disappointed you didnt add the durge reactivity that was promised
What a waste of a good vintage!!
the fact that the most replayed part is that hot photo of mizora. proves how horny BG3 players are
The guy in a purple robe ,he looks like a lvl 8 wizard from Clash of clans💀
Didn’t realize Lae’zel had an adorable look to her till she opened her gift from Jeff. But Karlach sinking in the snow had me in stitches.
3:00 "don't even think about licking it!"
most developers ignore funny shitpost cartoons about their game. fun developers see funny shitpost cartoons about their game and spread them around to promote both the artist and the game. and then there's Larian, *making their own* funny shitpost cartoons about their game.
Did you notice that in the beginning they had so much cameos and references ? But I noticed one for the SOCIC team. of Sonic, tails, Knuckles and Amy.
I really hope one day we get an animation with Tav, and it’s just all the Tav VAs being siblings.
I need an entire 7 season 23 episodes each one animated series now! 😭
Sometimes i think gale is a narcisist and other times i assume he can't make another illusion that isn't himself
If you are not gonna do more bg just give the ip
At this point in my playthroughs I just leave Karlach. I know she probably dies but I like to think it’s in a blaze of glory. I feel like it’s better that way, better for her not to see what I become.
How did I JUST notice Tommy, Gabriel, Sylvester and Turg sitting in the corner?
1:54  Damn
Shadowheaet and Astarion hugging Karlach for warmth is the most adorable thing ever.
Karlach should've gotten magical coolant instead of engine oil
Lmaooo “MY ENEMIES HEAD PRESERVED IN A JAAAH”🥺
@LarianStudios   Yeah, about that: You hooked us all up, on so many different levels. You made such an amazing game, I even watched 100 of hrs of playthroughs cause I'm poor. BUT: Instead of releasing it for PS4, now all the Xbox fan's can play it, the ones who spent several 100 for merely a better patch (PS5) and of course all the professional players with a real nice gamer PC. So I'm not only poor, but truly sad now.  Hundred of hours made me eager to save up and experience this once in a lifetime creation on my own. And what do I get with my lazy laptop and my PS4 (which took me years to save up btw), bubkiss! 😠  And yes, Astarion is beautiful!!
Karlach holding the elves is so accurate
This video has absolutely NO right being that funny, that informative, and THAT in character, and THAT LONG OF AN AD FOR XBOX RELEASE
I know I'm late, but at 0:09 is that just Sonic and his friends eating Spaghetti?!
Every time I watch one of these I'm wondering to myself "wait they forgot about the other guy" and have to remind myself that's my avatar
Is that who I think it is at the front table in the start
We arent getting any more of these, are we?
0:35 best part
What's next🤤🤤
WHY DO I FIND OUT ABOUT THESE.. NOW!!???
FIX ARCANE TRICKSTER ALREADY YOU AHOLES WTF
I'll never get tried of watching this
0:47 Damn, Karlach is hot!
Not that I don't dig regular Lae'zel quite a lot, but this Lae'zel, I like very very much.
Could you add keyboard and mouse support for Xbox? please
1:41....knew will was getting freaky with the Miz
1:54 goodness gracious the cake
I wish larian studios could just buy DnD from Hasbro
Lazeal’s and Geoff are the goated friends
Thank you so much Larian Studios ❤ Baldurs Gate 3 ist the best Game after The Witcher 3 you give me the Hope Back in Humanity❤❤❤❤
"Oh fucks sake" Astarion killed me 😂
gale please stop trying to eat my shoes
There's no way that Lae'zel is drinking with Geoff from Late night show with Craig Ferguson....
Gale always telling us not to lick things ffs
Not Gale eating boots XD
Is there any possibility of the older Divinity games getting remastered & re-released for current gen? I think it would be cool to be able to play them all on the same thing weither it's on pc or consoles. Also a way to get more people aware of the older titles and bring new life to the franchise.
Jack si por calabaza te travieso es como 💙 santa Claus 3
Larian since you're pretending like we're not gonna peer pressure you into making BG4, can you make this into a regular cartoon series?
Really does beg for an animated series
Larians is making a new RPG again, this is definitely needed. Personally, I'm tired of RPG
Glad youtube lets me see what the most replayed part is, starting to think mizora is the one people want a romance for
Классные короткометражки. Красивые, смешные и уютные.  Привет из страны, фанатеющей от РПГ.
Why does Karlach chewing the cord fee so right
I love how shadowheart didn't do anything but heal
You can, here Lae’zel!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  😂😂😂😂
You guys Reay should partner up with mashed to make this a web series.
2:43 Geoff what are you doing here? Craig is searching for you! :D
So…. No one gonna explain why karlach whole bread was so b-
so jesus is canon in dnd verse?
Behoooold, another Astral Prism . . . Technically a cube is also a prism.
i love how devious Astarion is in the shorts and how it compares to him in game. It’s so funny
Why isnt this mini "uncannon" comedy tv series😂
Wyll getting that Mizora photo had me surprised lol
Dont even tink about liking me Flashbacks made me laugh so hard
Karlach no! That electrical cable is not food!
He's drinking the blood of the owner of Larian Studios
Pllssss lemme do a german dub to it 😂😂 i would love to make a dub to it 🙏😭❤
Astarion constantly being on the verge of freezing to death is taking me out 😭
I’m posting it anywhere I think Larian will see it. You guys should look into making Shadowrun games! You’d be perfect at it!
I'm gonna hope they port it to the new Nintendo console so we can get another of these
In this style Laezel is so cute I can't stand it
Oh dear, they got an Lbox.. the worst present ever. 😂
Just noticed that santa's robes aren't red and are just bloodstained
When I saw wyll pull out a.          ❤picture❤ of Mynthara I was like “ I FUCKING KNEW IT!!!! I KNEEEEEWWWWW IT!!!!”
watching back on this... I feel like we need an animater mini series from Larian based on these characters lol
lol, how you doin Geoff, ol’ buddy ol’ pal?
1:33 shadowhearts face 😭❤️
We need this as a show with multiple seasons 😅
0:08 for Ioverse fans: bottom left is the Lost Mines of Phandelver - HARDCORE party
Quite the score.
is santa a drow?
When is crossplay coming to BG3?? Shouldn’t be that hard to add that. Pathetic
2:23 Astarion's Face! "You drag me all the way out here to freeze _beyond death_ and NOW WE HAVE TO *FIGHT* SOMETHING??!"  Honey, I don't think that frown could get any deeper.
wheres the elijah wood video
Lord of the Rings as next IP would be awesome.
0:08 Its them the hardcore phandalver crew!
I imagine Wyll just fashioned himself as the leader of the group without anybody asking, or even caring since they all just lead each other at any given moment lol
jeff.. how did you know🥺😂
Six months and still no animations featuring Minthara. Shame on you.
🔥🖤🔥
Seeing this makes we wish we could see all of baldurs gate 3 as am animated show.
The quality and comedy here feels very 2010's era youtube animated shorts. Very amazing work to the animators and artists
Karlach be lookin thicc
lol karlach sinking into the snow was a cute funny detail lol
1:36 WyZora <3
Where's the dragonborn? I wanna see the animated dark urge in these series!
this is what i imagine happens everytime i turn off baldurs gate 🤣
Does the cold effect vampires? That doesn’t really make any sense
We need a Baldur’s Gate animated series
1:54 GYAT!!!!!
ANIMATED LAEZEL IS SOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GEOFF PETERSON
Vampy boy sitting on the Tiefling’s lap was so silly
STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING!!
I need like dozens more of these
I could watch a whole show like this
shadowhearts little "heal" at the end 😭
Muito bom.
2:17 if you want a good look at all of them at once 😁. They're all freaking adorable!
If I knew the cast voiced this I would’ve been watched it😂
Yoooo, bottom left corner @0:09 - that's the "Phandelver Hardcore"-party of World of Io! :D
3:14 the scooby doo and shaggy frightend pose with Laezel and Gale lol
It’s canon K IS THICK
Hahahaha !!!
1:54 the bakery 💀
Found this currently playing on Xbox 😂
"Don't even think about licking it" lol I missed that one before
Please add customization for the cursor; i think will be increase too much the gameplay.
MORE
Where are the other companions.  The druid, the old one, and the other guy.
Astarion wouldn't be affected by the cold since he is technically undead.
now THIS is how you do a reveal
I was wondering why the voice acting was perfdct...the i realized lol
I need MORE PLEASE 😫😫😫🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I want this as a show - IMMEDIATELY!!!  😂❤
love the other DnD groups animated just at the tavern, loved seeing the hardcore BrettUltimaltus group there.
you guys coulda done a real animated show
In the first scene in the tavern, on the bottom left there is Sylvester, Gabriel, Turg, and Tommy from the world of IO’s phandelver game. I love that so much.
Heres me thinking wait a minute theres 6 of them, why cant we have 6 people 😂😂
There is a really annoying bug in the game where if you find gold on a shelf or on the ground you can’t pick it up and put it into your inventory. I just beat the toll keeper and I can’t pick up all the gold it dropped or the gold in the safe I unlocked. 😅😅😅😢😱😭👎🏻🥺
Anybody else need an animated bg3 series now?
Karlach with a barrel is hilarious because she's always my Master Barrelmancer
Karlach let those intrusive thoughts win in the end.
0:32 Wyll: What are you all sitting around for? We're not done yet!  Astarion: Oh, for (bleep) sake!
still the hottest rendition of karlach there is
If this was a show, everyone would watch it. just sayin.
Therory: Santa Elf was Durge
I want this to be a whole show XD
I love that astarion and shadowheart are curled up next to karlach bc she’s a furnace lol
"Don't even think about licking it". 💀💀💀
Surprised Gale didn't pull Mystara out of the bag
I don't see anyone else mentioning it, so I feel the need to do so! Astarion's Vintage """Wine""" is labled Swen Vincke, head and founder of Larian Studios!
completely missed me the first time through watching this that karlach apparently uses "daddy" rather than "mommy" to refer to herself. curious!  (she is a butch icon)
WE NEED A SHOW
STOP LICKING THE DAMN THING
Literally the only thing missing from this is Shadowheart casting Guidance for someone. I mean, it even popped up in the D&D game they played together
How do we get an animated series of this?! Is there a crowdfund yet? Kickstarter?! Who do we throw money at to make this happen?!?!
Dude I was wondering why the voice actors sound so on point and then I looked at the channel name. Larian is so based istg <3
Find me a game where you adore the cast more than this one 💜💜  Also.......animated BG3 series when?
Oh my god I need this as an animated show
Lae’zel 🗿❤️
Lol is ”Geoff” a critical role reference?
took me a while to realise that the elf's cloak was red with blood
0:07 i love the party that is clearly meant to be Sonic the hedgehog and co.
0:17 the skeleton’s name is Geoff!! That’s a reference to Craig Ferguson’s sidekick, Geoff Peterson! So cool!
SER Aylin and no alphabets=best mods. Bait and switching bs larian
Can we please get more of these animated shorts? I desperately need more. 😢
Tommy's a good kid at heart
Not Gale eating the boot 💀
I felt Astarions FFS straight to the core when it comes "here's another sidequest"
This is canon now
1:36 I love that even Larian proves it is canon, for us fans of our origin Wyll's more... tempestuous playthrough choices.  They truly understand us *WyZora* shippers!  Feels -hotter than Avernus- good man 🥲
I know what I want for Christmas this year, Larian!  Lemme romance Karlach AND Shadowheart...  I can never make up my mind!  [Drooling sounds]
Was that Geoff Peterson Lae’zel was drinking with?
Astarion wrapped in a blanket sitting on Karlach’s lap to stay warm is totally me.
why was gale eating a firefighting boot lol
Geoff you smooth talker you
It's the goblin slayer!!! (0:08)
If this was made into a series, I would watch the crap out of it, as I'm sure so many others would.
BTW when is the next season for Critical Role coming out? Get on it Amazon!!!!
Larian Studios, I LOVE BG3 and your past games (e.g., DOS, DOS2, etc.) but...  Strength Stats for female Origin PCs:  * Lae'zel  @  17 strength * Shadowheart  @  13 * Karlach  @  17  Strength Stats for male Origin PCs: * Astarion  @  8 strength * Gale  @  8 * Wyll  @  8  * The Dark Urge  @  8  OH COME ON?!  Were Sweet Baby Inc., BGG, and/or Anna Sarkisyan hired as consultants for your company?  If so, TERMINATE their services, and DO NOT hire the likes of them ever again!
Funny that Astarion fears cold the most while beeing actually undead 😂
2:42 XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD that face! Hahahahahha~ OH GOD HAHAHAHHA brilliant!!
1:45 *takes the bag*   Santa got a *bag of holding*
Это прекрасно 🤣
Lazeal opening the head ina box XD
Can someone please explain what kind of creature the fake santa was? And why there were so many other dead creatures that had the same colour as his back?
0:09 that’s the ioverse lost mines of phandelver crew on the bottom left!
„Your heart‘s desire!  Karlach gets motor oil. I love how literal this is. 👏👏👏
I could watch them for hours i love these va’s so much they brought these characters to life imo
Larian needs to make a game from elric of melnibone
I just love that this is official and you can TELL the voice actors had fun doing this🤣
Create a series please
Who's Geoff? 😅
She chomped that cord like the queen she was
3:00 don't even THINK about licking it
Who's Geoff?
Lae'zel's quote when she opens her gift is my favorite Lae'zel quote ever, I love her so much whenever I see that scene 😭
Larian's really starting to make me want an animated series with these characters.
I love how aggressively posh astarion’s voice is
karlach got a dud gift because she already had me so santa had to think quick
That "My gods i'm beautiful" at the end is so Astarion lmao
Astarion sitting on mama K's knees 😊
Astarion sitting on Karlach's lap to keep warm is the bext thing ever lmao, I love him so much
One of the tables at the start has human version of sonic characters
While this is absolutely tragic, good for Larian for sticking to their principles. It's terrible we won't see BG4. Please, please, please make mod tools or campaign editor for BG3, so the game can last forever.
The whole mizora wyll joke is so gross.
Anyone else notice astarion not showing up in the mirror?(he is a vampire, so he cant be seen in mirrors)
That karlach cake when she reached in the bag though
I love how the sack has everything the heart desires, and Karlach got the infernal engine oil because her "heart" desires it, even if she doesn't lmao
don't even think about licking it 😂
Lae'zel succeeding on a Perception check? That's a Christmas miracle!
Karlach, you're fire resistant, not lightning immune.
Astarion meets The Cat from Red Dwarf, WIS save at disadvantage.
we now need a BG3 cartoon
0:09 Oh my god they put BrettUltimus's Lost Mines of Phandelver party in this! Sylvester, aka the oldest tiefling you've ever seen, Gabriel, the sole normal one, Tommy, the halfling int-dump wizard and Turg, the dwarf with an accent as thick as his beard! I love Larian for this!
Asterion looks like a cranky cat while Shadowheart is cuddling Karlach's arm. I love Karlach and want good things for her. Like a trip to Build-A-Bear.
I loved Astarion sitting on Karlach’s lap to keep warm LOL
Really good and entertaining advert
1:54  GYAAAAAAAAAAAAT
the icicles on Lae'zel's ears lmfao
We need more of this!!!
1:35. Astarion and Laezel both doing mental Insight checks...
Omg I’m dead. I never would have expected that Geoff reference.
The game is beautiful, but the enemies are weak))) Sven, add a couple of levels to Balthazar, Laezel destroys him with a couple of pokes))) And so almost everywhere. And yes, I played Divine Divinity the year it was released)))
Um, WHO is Geoff?
Where is Dark Urge??   The character is not even on the cover of the game, a little respect for the badass dragonborn please.
I know they gave up on DLC because of some silly level reason (e.g., just make the enemies harder), but this is cute.
My sandwich tastes like a fried boot… my sandwich is a fried boot!
As someone who is currently falling in love with your game (and characters!), I must say, this is PERFECT! 😂 It has all the cute social interactions, chemistry and humour I so love! Every character is so cute in this! You can't leave one unattented for even a minute! How Lae'zel adores her present and how you can hear her offscreen, licking the x-box despite Gale's plea, haha.  Astarion's "For Fuck's sake!" is adorable (though him being adorable in a way is his thing, I guess), as is him freezing (it's nice if someone else shares the freeze!) and sitting on Karlach's knees, hahaha! With Shadowheart on her other side, love it! Or Wyll, with his present. Or Gale, adoring Tara. Gosh. I could watch a whole series of those! It's so well balanced.   And how do you get all these outstanding voiceactors? Even the Santa-Elf is awesome!   Thanks for your hard work, love it a lot.
Are they going make more of these cartoons? They should add Durge to it.
I refuse to believe this isn’t canon
XD  Absolutely loved this!
love that the actual voice actors are here
“oh for FUCKS sake :<“
Ok, Im just going to ask because Im stupid. Why did they kill "santa". From what i can gather its because he killed a bunch of Goblins?
They need a cartoon series!
THIS IS FANTASTIC!! Praying you will be moved enough to either release dlc or a second game with same characters. So well written from start to finish from characterization that has both humor & heart, impeccably scored, mechanics that work great and react in fun & interesting ways, I have sung the praises of this game ever since I began playing! Great work, and I’d pay a LOT of money for DLC &/or additional content, and I know I’m not the only one. Got my pc copy as a gift, wound up purchasing console special Ed & paying additional $ to get deluxe Ed on pc just to support you guys. I’ll continue to do so, planning to investigate Divinity (believe those are the series mentioned in pc opening ad) after I need a BG3 break
The fans are BEGGING for more of these I need more BG3 animated in my life😭🙏
THE FUCKING BOOT
Geoff!🥹
Need more of this ❤❤❤
Worst Christmas gift possible 🙂
Please! For the love of all of Faerûn, make more of these!
Oh gods World of IO's hardcore campaign was featured and they put Turg in a paper bag . . .
cool work you're doing there
Just give us a tv show of this
so does this mean were getting another short for whenever crossplay comes out?
Omg these are amazing. Please make more!
0:59 a true mama k moment, heating up her babies in the dead of winter🥺
Astarion in Karlach's lap had me screaming
These are the *slightly* more serious game equivalents to the Manscaped ads, but I think these are the best advertisements ever.
WHAT THE F*CK DID NEIL DO TO SWEN?!  Edit: Nevermind, our toxic little boy needs warmth from Mama K's lap... lucky bastard.
This is the worlds greatest gaming ad ive seen, did not even consider it could have been an add til the ending
Ejdjdjj we need more animations these are so good 😂💖💖💖
i cant take it, they're all so cute omg.
This giving me clash-a-Rama flash backs
I would die for an entire show based on the BG3 main characters that's just them getting into whacky hijinks
Why does karlach have a jet ski😂
This is so freaking cute lmfao
It took way too long for me to realize Astarion's reflection was just a floating coat
jeoff look so happy
You know I just realized? There’s the party from Lost Mines of Phandelver Hardcore here.
Karlach just CHOMPING the cord🤣🤣
Shadowheart snuggling up on Karlach for warmth was so cute! ❤😂
This would be the best Saturday morning cartoon. I'd watch every episode. Astarion steals the show everywhere.
Good 🎉😅
I can't be the only one who remembers Santa showing up in the Lion, The Witch and the Wardobe.
0:17 the skeleton Geoff!! Is that a reference to Late Late Night qith Craig Ferguson show??? That was hilarious!! Now we gotta have the fake horse too
I know only a little about Baldur's Gate 3, but this xmas mini made me laff!   Diabolical 🎅and Astarion is always my favorite character. 💗
0:43 HE DID THE POINT AAAAH
i hate how self aware they are. keep up the good work.
shadowheart clinging to karlach is possibly my favorite image ever. i want to do an origin run just so i can make them fall in love
That was amazing! Karlach getting fried after biting the wire then Shadowhart healing her immediately afterward was hilarious!
i would 100%, without a shadow of a doubt, watch a full animated series of bg3 with all th voice actors
Karlach is wifey af
Tell me Larian Studios, when?  WE DEMAND AN ANIMATED SERIES
Gosh I want more of these shorts lmao 😂
Я ваш большой фанат. Спасибо за огромную проделанную работу и за то что показали как надо делать игры всему миру❤ 🎉буду ждать длс,новых игр,и мульт анимацию по бг 3❤😅
Man, I wish I had found this two months ago. Damn. Ah well.  Kinda makes you wonder where the Dark Urge is during all this. Poor guy must be spending Christmas in his cell.
Gale chilling with his astral projection clone or whatever it is gives major mirage energy
Ok, Larian Studios actually managed to make me like Lae'zel here. I don't know why I found "Another mysterious box" so funny 😆
3:13 Is it Orin disguised as lae'zel?
Love u guys so much! Thank u about all of ur games! U ar the best!! ❤
Karlach is the best of all time, I've tried so many times to leave her behind and not playing her on my team but I simple cannot, Karlach is a must have!
Gith are, and will always be, the true cat species.
Lae'zel being traumatized at the end, poor gal!😂
Karlach melting the snow made me chuckle. Biting the cable sent me!😂
For anyone who didn't notice, in the start of the video inside the tabern you can ser a table with the versions of Sonic, Tails, Amy and Knuckles eating spaghetti
'hey...look at us"
I just noticed if you pause right at 0:40, you can see Gales boot is slightly eaten.
That's a lovely commercial.
Would definitely watch a series of this
They are so adorable
I can't believe you all hid a "Hot Ones" reference into this. That's so niche but delightful. Kuddos to whoever came up with that.
My momentary confusion who’s that red skinned chick why does Wyll have horns? Oh She’s that super evil devil I attacked with letting her try and spread her lies…… but really why does wyll have horns😅
Lol😂 I just got the game on Xbox..
PLEASE MORE OF THESE😭😭😭
They really have to make a limited animated series.  Or not so limited.  Like a good adventure time.
I need a full series of this
Gale eating the boot made me laugh so hard I had to pause the video 🤣🤣
We need the dark urge as leader
magic shoes😂
Ok, seeing as the party are able to touch Karlach without burning to death, I can assume that she's either had her engine repaired, or it's so cold that it's balancing out her internal heat.
Man I wish I knew these shorts existed long ago. This would've been the best way to reveal the Xbox release
If a series is made, hopefully they won’t “Hazbin Hotel” the original cast.
I'm currently playing Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox, and I'm LOVING IT.
Baldur gate is the best game in the world, if have baldur gate 4 i will buy.
Astarian sitting on karlach's lap for warmth is what got me.
I love how Karlachs first instinct when holding the power cable is "Bite it".
its getting to the point they could probably turn this into a successful tv show
The cast is perfect, the comedy is gold and the content is peak.
Santa killed some Christmas themed goblins don’t see the problem
This is the greatest plaaannn!!😂
You guys seriously rock! Great game. Keep up the good work, and don't sell your business to EA or Microsoft.
Who is Geoff?
When is the next episode coming out?
Shadowheart was not shy about snuggling up to Karlach. 🥰
Crazy if we could actually have 6 in one party
Gale casually fork-and-knifing a magic boot 🤣🤣🤣
Omg!!
I can’t believe they got the Hardcore Lost Mines of Phandelver Group in this animation.
The Paul Rudd Hot Ones meme reference with Gale at the beginning is perfection!
I like the game even mkre because it doesn't burn my pc down like total war warhammer 3 does.
0:08 OMG it's him. It's Thomas "Goblin Slayer" Turner!
No wonder why they're so confused seeing the site of an XBOX "like what is this thing?" 😂
Karlach has so nice abs as cartoon, wish it would be same in game 🥲
Y'all are really sleeping on the "look at us" joke. It slayed me completely
0:08 Bottom Left, its the Mines of Phandelver crew from ioverse. Theres the murderous Tommy. An 8 int wizard thats a crackshot with a crossbow
I want more animated bg3 😭😭😭😭
0:36 Astarion is such a brat and i love it.
This entire sketch is ABSOLUTE GOLD.
Can someone help me understand what exactly happened with the elves? I am so lost😅
Karlach, Shadowheart and their adopted son 1:00
Gale eating a boot is perfect
I love that evryone agrees are favorite demon tomboy as a massive ass
Astarion sat on Karlach’s lap to warm up 😭
Am I the only who thinks Astarion sounds like the devil in cuphead?
Astarion OH FOR FUCKS SAKE destroyed me
I did not notice the”red robe” detail until the third watch through when Astarion was modeling it in front of the mirror…
karlach slowly melting the snow by leaning against it is so funny.  love these personal touches edit: one of the only unrealistic parts was shadowheart and lae'zel rolling higher initiative than gale 😂
shadowheart snuggling karlach 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Oh god damn it. The party cameo from last time and this one near the beginning with the yellow magic user, blue and pink haired armored people and the tall dark skinned red head are flipping Sonic refrences.
I love the tiny detail of Karlach melting the snow
i wouldve figured karlach pulled out a live heart
Netflix with many seasons perhaps?🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
You know, I've watched these and I sometimes wonder how my custom character would act in the given situations, both by themselves and with the rest of the party.
Why do they care if "Santa" killed and ate a bunch of goblins? 😂 Goblins aren't people.
3:00 i literally choked on laughter
I dont like this genre of games but when I see the love The Baldurs Gate got from its creators, I might buy it
Stop that  *Lickkkkkk*
THIS IS AMAZING MORE MORE MORE MORE PLEASEEEE
0:36
Okay.. the oh for fuck's Sake will be my new ringtone
Kinda disappointed that the "Santa" isn't a dwarf, I mean: stubby, with a neat beard, sounding like a fat senior and expert in craftsmanship? Well, at least this way we don't get another dwarf being a <spoiler>! 😆
Video Astarion: "Finally, a moment of reprieve from adventure!" Game Astarion: "Please don't give me any reprieve from adventure. It's so boring"
ASTARION ON KARLACHS LAP FOR WARMTH 😂😂😂
I love Gale eating his magic boot
i hate ads but i love BG3 -.-
damn. but wheres our trusty bhaalspawn
I am just going to assume Santa Elf was The Dark Urge.
I only just realised that Astarion is modelling the Elf's robe when they are back in the Tavern. Missed that the first time.
Karlach melting the snow mound was a nice touch.
The very finest "oh for fucks SAKE" in history. Not angry, just disappointed....
It just dawned on me. He says it gives your heart's truest. Desires and karlac got oil for her engine which is her heart
KARLACH HAS THE ENGINE AND IT SAID TRUEST HEART DESIRE LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Geoff is a W
I can feel Astarion in 0:36 when I just spent 3 hours driving my family around, and then my mom wants to go to a thrift store.
2:37 is the best part of this whole video. Look at Lae'zel's eyes!
Love the delusion in the entire party eyes when they see the xbox
who is Geoff?
Gale eating the boot killed me 😂
They really sound like the Baldurs gate characters
2:23-Seriously, pause and look at their expressions.
Fuck your unfair trash game
Confirmed, Santa is the Dark Urge in the animations' universe
NOT GALE EATING A MAGIC BOOT SHSHHSHDHDF
I thought that Gale would get a gun. Shadow Wizard Money Gang after all
Karlach Waifu all the damn way
1:35  I love how everyone is doing the amazed face apart from Astorian or Lae'zel! 🤣
On the shot of everyone beaming with anticipation over the bag, Astarion and Lae'zel both look unimpressed, then glance at each other. They know it's too good to be true, setting up Lae'zel searching one side of the camp while Astarion checks the other.  Details are great.
Karlach showing us why shes wife
Geoff?  Did they put Geoff Peterson in the game?  😀https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Peterson
Gale: "Don't even think about licking it." Karlach: *Proceeds to chomp on wire*
This is what happens when developers love what they're working on.
Shadowheart hugging Karlach's arm for warmth is adorable.
Ah Gale's infamous "Stoplickingit!" returned!
Little foreshadowing with the blotch of green on his suit.
Who’s Geoff?
This is the funniest shit I've ever seen, THANK YOU LARIAN
She bit the wire like a dog, lol.
Would watch an entire series animated this way
Seeing the other dnd crews was a interesting
I would love for Larian Studios to create a series based on Baldur's Gate. I've already read the comic books, but watching them on television, as well as playing the video game, is much better. That's why I always love it when game companies release these shorts and cinematics, but of course the TV series would follow the theme of the game, not the comedy theme of this video.
Karlachs deepest hearts desire is engine oil. Thats too good
We love you guys! Work on the next instalment, remove the level cap!
Gods bless Karlach. Best girl.
Why is Wyll blushing when he gets that picture of Mizora? She actively abuses him, and I don’t think he’s ever shown interest in her before. (I might be reading too much into this, but it bothered me.)
MOOOOOORRRRREEEE! I love these so much! Doing my 3rd play through and I cant get enough of these shorts! (Personally could watch a whole season)
I really appreciate that they didn't put a single spoiler in this. 😊
i fully expected my original character to show up and was confused for about 2 seconds when he didnt 😭
I love how you all care about console players just as much.
I wonder when the misadventures of Durge will happen with the party
This is just perfect. Karlach melting through the snow, Gale munching on a Boot, Astarions "Oh for fuck sake", Astarion and Shadowheart using Karlach as a heater, Karlach munching on the power cord. just so on point
THE PHANDELVER HARDCORE CREEW YESSS!!
1:01 I choked when Astarion started sitting on Karlach's lap for warmth
Is this how I find out Baldur's Gate 3 is on Xbox? Almost a month later?
Hilarious and at time adorable
lol just as epic as the game
Can we get this as a series please???
*suspicious cord leading to mysterious box*  "So ive gotta bite that"
You think it’d Burn immediately or the grip will rip it off  asking the important questions here🤔
How is this ad so fucking good
I would love for this to be an actual series 😂
I love that Larian keeps supporting this game and doing stuff like this. It really shows a passion that's been missing from gaming for a long time.
0:36 😂😂😂😂😂
Shadowheart trying not to puke and semi-panicked "Heal!" 😂
0:36 Personal time stamp
0:56 Astarion literally DIES and Karlach melts through the snow. Fuck me, that’s good.
Nice touch how Astarion is extremely cold and shivering while Karlach is unfazed. She doesn't even have any snow on her either.
I LOVE KARLACCHHHHHH
why am I so downbad for Karlach?
0:09 TOMMY!!!
So you’re saying my Wyll x Mizora run is feasible?
OH MY GOD IT'S THE LOST MINES OF PHANDELVER CREW FROM THE WORLD OF IO!!
make a show
10/10 animation its so cute
Ah yes Tommy is going on a Adventure
Geoff on his visit to his vacation home in the forgotten realms
Is that Geoff from Craig Fergusons late night show? 😂😂😂😂
I love this so much and love the game!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
cute
Seeing this makes me want a 6 band mode… 😢
i can see why mizora is wyll's patron. ddaanngg
I really wish me and my roommate saw this animation before we bought the game, we just stumbled upon that BG3 was available in the Xbox store just by window shopping 😂😂
>Karlach in an alcohol coma.  Grog: respect.
I need a series now
Please please please.. if there is any change..please make a animated series with your amazing characters.
Karlach melting the snow..because she is..hot..is super cute and a nice detail
Thank Larian for putting up with Microsofts crap! I'm so happy it's on Xbox now.
Ok now i need a Baldurs gate animated series like Vox machina, right away.
I love the animations and the characters anyway...but x Box?  nope
MAKE A BG3 SHOW
Hmm those 4 on the table to the left look familiar....... Welp i hope they have a good adventure
When the animation is so great, you can tell it is spot on when you haven't even played the game.
You guys never cease to amaze. Thank you so much for all of your hard work!
I need a Netflix serie of this !!!!
I wonder how they sound like in the game until I realise it was larian studio who the one upload it 🤣
I finally got why Karlach got oil. The bag grants one's heart's desire, she doesn't have a heart. She got what the infernal engine wanted.
This is nice and all but I’m kinda soured that my playthrough got a game breaking bug that completely stops me from saving on my 200 plus hour playthrough for ps5. Fix your game before you make this cutesy animations, that is appreciating your community, not this. Kinda just pi**es me off really.
Pahahha the licking sounds and Gale's "stop that"
Just make an animated series and keep the VAs working hard I say. If Vox Machina can do it, Baldur's Gate can do it.
Goated studio fr
I love how Karlach was literally waist deep in the snow because she melted through
another!!
I hope if they continue the shorts, Minthara and Halsin will get animated as well.
“COME…TO…DADDY-!” - Karlach, 2023
Okay we need a Balders gate cartoon with the whole crew 😂 I need more then 4 min of this
An advertisement for Xbox release? This is one ad I would refuse to skip!
Alright damnit I'll buy a series of these. Getting impatient waiting for season 3 of Vox Machina anyway.
I love it. Perfect amount of chaos
I have to kill shadow heart
I love Lae'zel licking in the background and Gale just "Stop it" 😂
I would love a web series of shorts
I love Larian ❤
Please, pretty please keep making the animation guys! I'll totally watch in any streaming platform. 😍
Is Geoff a Late Late Show Reference? Is Gale eating a boot a reference to the DnD game the cast played?
ASTARIAN ON KARLACHS LAP TO KEEP HIM WARM!!!!🤣😂 1:02
Gale to Lae'zel "Don't even think about licking it"  I fucking love this knowing exactly what he's referencing.
Astarion's sass is beautiful
Astarion stil remains the best one even in an Animated video, love that character
And then Gale proceeds to seduce the Santa without his consent
Astarion in the mirror! 😁😁😁
It's so cute ;w;
Astarion this entire video was just a zesty mood and I’m here for it 😭😂
When do we get the miniseries for this?
I saw Gabriel in  the tavern and it made me very happy, thank you for including the hardcore phandelver crew in here.
My favorite parts all have karlach in them especially when she chomps on the cord 😂
0:39 Karlach. Gods I want to marry that woman.😂
Geoff Peterson! Been wondering what he'd gotten up to.
I want Astarian's "oh for fuck's sake!" As a ringtone/notification setting!
Why has absolutely nobody mentioned the fact Wyll does the soyjak pointing pose
I must say, the team dynamic is wholesome. Also Karlach melting is just hilarious
Now make a really cool animation for cross play :)
To be fair Infernal engine oil would be very helpful to the lady who literally needs an infernal engine inside her chest to live
Omg, I can't get over at how precious laezel looks when opening her gift
Pleeeeasse don’t make Xbox wait this long again!
One day urge, one day
I love all of the BG3 companions! They seem like friends that I'd want to have IRL.
"My God's im beautiful"
Can someone explain to me why this scene 2:18. What was battle scene for and the elf having painted red outfit?
This would be an amazing show 😂
I saw Brett's hardcore party in the tavern, nice lil' reference.
Did wyll do the soy point at 0:44 💀💀💀
Lae'zel is such a sweetheart in this hahaha
man if you put it in ps4 i would be super happy
We need a full series of these animations. They are amazing
The quality of a passionate fanimation on top of official voices and clever memes? It's a Yule miracle!
No matter how many times i hear it, Astarion's "Oh for Fuck's sake" still cracks me up 😂
see...if i reached into that bag Karlach would've disappeared and then reappear in my hands
The love put into this game is genuinely heartwarming
I’ve never played the game, why is Gale eating his boot?
This proves nothing keeps you warm in winter better than Karlach!
Let me guess. We’re Geoff.
It was a goblin invasion. Elf didn't even do anything wrong ut self defense WOW
would pay to watch this series 😁
the voice acting in this game was on another league!! great talent
THE GAS BC ITS HER HEARTS GREATEST DESIRE OML
Its amazing videos like this that make me want a full-on animated BG3 series XD
Wyll is a treasure
Thank you for this new cartoon ! So good, we would like more please !!!
This could be so into netflix or something, it has great quality. Also I love the detail you put in the characters, like little easter eggs
1:39 that “oh…” has so many layers props to theo
2:42 only Lae'zel can have the cutest reaction to such a gruesome gift.
Karlach is indeed best girl
Help me out here guys, so Santa ate the elves and reindeers? Also, why is the back of his coat green? 😂
I 👏🏻 Demand 👏🏻 A 👏🏻 TV 👏🏻 Show 👏🏻 Dammit. I know they have the funds.
did they change Wyll VA?
Wait. Xbox still exists? O_o WAIT! PS5!! STILL EXISTS! WTF! I joke.
nice :P
I literally cried. Me and my friends love this game
Baldur's Gate 3 on my series X for ever 😊
please please please PLEASE ad cross play with PS and PC its very sad having to sit and play alone while my friends playing without me
Lae’zel so hot!
I love this game ❤️
Why isn’t minthara in any of these or halsin
Gale playing with his cat is so adorable
Need more of that!! 😂❤️❤️
I love that karlach just bit the cord
THE SOUND OF LAE’ZEL LICKING IT ANYWAY HEEELLLP
If Netflix or Prime decided to produce a full animated series with these characters it would be a near guaranteed hit.
1:34 with shadowhearts look.. she was thinking about food wasnt she.
“Oh for fucks sake”   Has me cackling
Larian is just what the gaming industry needs these days
1:41 I'll just save it real quick
I don't get it, what happened with Santa and the elves?
I'll be honest, I didn't see 'blood stained robe' at first, I just legit thought he shat himself.
The best present would be the save fix on Xbox
"MY gods I'm beautiful 😂😂😂
Ayyyeee. Yooo Karlck lookin caked up
Now THIS is how you ad
I don't know how I stumbled onto this conspiracy but I need to expose it. Why is every Skeleton ever always named some veriant of Geoff. It's always Geoff or Jeff! IT'S ALWAYS GEOFF!
It's more accurate if every character tells Santa Claus that they're actually deeply in love with him for no reason within 5 minutes of meeting him.
Fucking Sonic, Amy, Tails, and Knuckles being there, fucking AWESOME! 👏
For me, it’s the joke about Mizora. I couldn’t comprehend why Wyll made a deal with a Devil until I actually saw her and instantly understood.
i love you guys
Please make more great games, i need, not want, NEED another baldur's gate.
Thatch is freakin cute. No! Adorable!
XD, it's the little things that make games fun, this made my day
XD ich liebe es wie karlach einfach ins Kabel beißt bester Charakter
"Don't even think about licking it." *Licking noises in the background*
Nah Xbox is slacking if they only added bg3 a few weeks ago💀💀
Now if only cross-play were available as well
Lmao, Love this
I am absolutely begging. BEGGING for this to become a series. Please. for the love of bhaal PLEASE.
2:40 Somehow y’all found a way to make La’Zel adorable despite how mean she is. Good job!
We need a mini-series in this tone!!!
i love how Karlachs first instrict is to try and bite the cable I love her so much!
QUITLICKINTHEDAMNTHING!
XBOXHUEG is eternal
Shadowcute didn't get a present. I guess she's been... Naughty.... 😏      Damn I'm terrible.
soooo... Cross platform??
I love how they got the voice actors to voice this goofy little adventure
Good God I love this animation style. I would love to see a full on cartoon of these characters just doing shenanigans
ok who wants an animated series og BG3 in this style
Bought this game end of year but haven't played it yet on my Deck Pls Larian Studios implement fsr3 and afmf/frame generation for this We need stable 60 fps on handhelds😢😢
I chose the dark urge so half of them are dead
i absolutely love Lae'zel ☺
I love Laezel's face 😂❤
Is the VA for Astarion the same VA for Kid Icarus Uprising's Hades? Dude is ALWAYS on point if they are
Fantastic Piece of Art. I love the Animation and especially the Voice Acting ya´ll Great!
So gale is the leader of the party?
😂
Even Larian didnt know what xbox was
You mfs better give us a way to save Karlach properly!
Gale eating a magic artifact is just icing on this ice cream cake (haha get it ice-? God kill me)
Really Larian, you just made me want to start a new game, another week playing non stop....
Geoff has too much game, cant dream to romance lae zael lke that :/
just quicksave and quickload - what for an overrated game!!! the dice mechanic is absolut horrible and unrealistic, it destroys the imagination if a rouge didnt see the entrace of a cave for child where the child stands and disappear. Yes I can reroll with inspiration or reload. What is this for a bulls...?  There are so much better games! Story si good, graphics are okay, to many bugs and laggs and Baldurs Gate 2 and Dragon Age, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Night was sooo much better...
IS THAT TOMMY, TURG, GABRIEL, AND SYLVESTER I SEE?! 0:09   Larian Studios I didn’t know you watched the Worlds IO as well 🥲 I never expected to see them in this it makes me so happy
Honestly thought it was BS that BG3 got GTY now playing it DLC and sequel def needed I LOVE KARLACH to death!
I'm not going to ask why Lae'zel is drinking beer with a skeleton? But why are Gale (and his magical projection) eating boots? Seriously, is this a reference?
I dont want a netflix live action. I want this, more of this.
"Don't even think about licking it" 😂😂
Wheres durge?
okay, first: fucking fantastic Geoff reference. second: just started playing BG3 a week ago.... i've made way too many characters... lol awesome game. way to go, Larian
Wonderful work with so many details and jokes xD Oh, and just in case anyone at Larian reads this: would there be any chance that you release a Deluxe Edition that does not contain the actual game (aka, just the physical goodies)? I'm probably not the only one who already bought the game on Steam and would like to get the goodies without paying for a second copy of the game.
By Gods and Hells Plz don’t stop making these wonderful animations.
Baldur's gate 3 on Xbox just deleted all my save data😢
1:54 Bless the animators, they knew exactly what they were doing
I dont get the joke of why they attacked santa. Yeah i see the dead elves but why did they turn on him? Maybe im just dumb
This is cute 😂😂❤
1:47 Hearing Karlach say “come to daddy” really awakened something in me 🤣
I haven't gotten far enough in the game to get the Gale eating boots joke (or maybe just missed it) and at this point I'm really afraid
Not Wyll blushing over Mizora. Really.?
1:40 is most replayed lol
Astarion, ''Oh! For Fuck's sake!" 2023! best line ever!
I wish this would be tv show.
How did they make Lae'zel so adorable?
0:44 this was 100% traced over a soyjak
the impressions on all the characters is amazing! animation is well done as well👏
People really love these characters You all did a fantastic job
Love this studio.
Can you just do complete BG3 animated series please?)
“OH FOR FUCKS SAKE”   IM DECEASED
Aww ❤ Karlach warming up Astarion is so freaking adorable 😍
Astarion failed his con save 🤣

Stupid as it may sound adding the player voice lines in parts qs a different race sex and voice type would be funny
When you realise Santa was Dark Urge :D
The bottle Astarion holds out at 0:26 is from 1972. Since it's It's 1492 DR in the D&D timeline, this must refer to Earth years. Toril is written to have a connection to Earth. Earth's time measurement is about 630 years ahead of Toril's. So, as of Baldur's Gate, it's about 2122 on Earth.  Astarion has had that bottle for 150 years. He cracked it open for this special occasion and then threw it on the ground.
When i see the xbox, the first thing that come to my mind was that stupid meme about Peter griffim saying xbox
Worth every Second i spent, only thing i have to note is i would have loved to spend more time watching but alas such as life its a good present non the less
Lae'zel is my grumpy best friend :D
I didn't expect to see the WorldofIO "Lost Mines of Phandelver" crew(current) at a table in the beginning, that through me through a loop for a bit once I realized who I was seeing XD!
It suck’s she didn’t get the ring that made her huggable
Ngl, I always kill karlach so wyll don’t get the devil horns and redskin.
Wait Wyll is a Tiefling??!
Everyone replayed to see what caused the explosion 😂
the elves look like grots
0:36 😂
I like how mashed added human versions of Sonic, Amy, Tails and Knuckles in the tavern
Karlach be looking kinda thiccc tho
your PR-Team is insane! :D
the amount of money i would pay... for an animated bg3 tv show... i'm not even kidding i'd sell my soul please i need it
"DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT LICKING IT" IM DEAD
Was that Geoff from the Craig Ferguson show?
Karlach the walking heat exchanger.
Thanks for bringing it out on Xbox. Okay, my wife and Kids think otherwise, but I'm enjoooooooyyyyyyying it!!!
Damn Karlach caked up
0:46 it's kinda adorable how Karlach melts snow XD
I love this with all my heart
the world of Io charaters were priceless
PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!!!!! Make more of these shorts. They are funny as HELL and I am loving them so much. I laughed so hard during the whole thing. I would love to see a regular weekly short.
this shows how much we need an entire show animated like this covering the events before during and after bg3.
“My gods I’m beautiful”   Yes you are king. Keep it up sweetie.
Oh, Karlach! *cue laugh track*
Id watch 26 seasons of this 😂😂 love these animations my bard would be perfectly at home in this chaos following Astarion around 😂😂
Karlach is hot as always 😁
My biggest problem with baulders gate 3 is I’ve played it so much I’ve adopted the speech patterns of the characters/narrator and now everyone I talk to thinks I’m a stuck up
Karlach slowly melting the ice and sinking was awesome. She's definitely my boo. I'll never do a "kill Karlach" playthrough.
tal'dorei might become jealous if this became a tv series. i would totally watch it too.
I always know what Baezel wants. :) Always.
Guess tieflings are antofreeze
Ironic that the only reason i’m watching this is because i got an xbox and BG3 for Christmas, phenomenal game
lmao
1:54 🥵
Where is the dark urge 😢
Larian could actually make tv show if they wanted.
Ooh is that the hardcore crew right at the start? Very nice.
Mizora the sexcubus demon lady 1:40
Add mouse and keyboard support please☠️☠️☠️
Please tell me Karlach biting the power cable is a reference to the cat in National Lampoons Christmas Vactation.
This literally is the best thing to watch every time and I make sure I never miss it
Plz make this into an animated series. We love it!
This was WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than a compilation of Baldur's Gate gameplay that we've already seen. I am going to get a new Xbox to play Baldur's on there. Thank you, Larian.
I think I speak for most when I say I just want this cartoon.
damn Larian y'all couldn't cheek up Karlach in the game like this???
Dang an absolute masterpiece ruined by the end reveal...
Karlach is so me
Um.. This is a bit much... Even for me.
Thank you guys for Divinity: Original Sin and BG 3 ❤️
A jet ski lmaooo
Help Needed- After telling minthara where the grove was she just walked off the bridge. I got the dialogue to search her for her parasite so she is dead but the grove quest hasn’t ended.   Now when I blow the horn to start the fight against her the cutscene starts but when I’m supposed too talk to her she’s not there and my character just stares at nothing until I’m forced to close the game.  (Playing on ps5)
Loved this vid. Then realized it was a damn xbox add. PASS...
2:55 behold the punchline of the joke! Xbox
L: Another mysterious box G: Don't even think about licking it  L: *Licks it* G: WHAT DID I JUST SAY!?
Fix the save problem
I finally got the game and I’m so excited to play! 😊
I just occured to me; is Geoff the skeleton a reference to Craig Ferguson's talk show buddy Geoff?
I heard laezel licking in the background, so Laezel licking the spider official?
MY BAKER! TOMMY THE GOBLING SLAYER! IO Rep here blew my socks off!
so...when the release date for the physical for xbox?
We love u guys so MUCH! That's perfect! Thank you for all the love <3
Even as the goofy cartoon versions, it's weird to have Wyll blushing and Karlach teasing him as if Mizora is just some hot chick Wyll has a crush on. She's treats Wyll like a *pet*, not a person, and neither Wyll nor Karlach express anything but contempt for her in the game.
I'm just going to say it. If Neil Newborn isn't tapped to play Fulgrim in Henry Cavil's Warhammerverse I'm going to be pissed...
Okay, so at 0:09 we see Larian and their own dnd characters in the bottom left, but something else I noticed, in the top right, is that Sonic and his friends but humanized?  Short orange character with a double tail being represented by a coat tails for Tails.  Blue spiky hair for Sonic.  Pink shoulder length hair for Amy  And more muscled bound character for Knuckles?  Someone please tell me I’m not crazy
I just noticed wyll is doing the wojak meme point at 0:44 .
Thank you for this wonderful video game, happy holidays!
Just bought the game for myself as a Christmas gift. Enjoying it, and knocked it out the park!
This is one of the best animated YouTube videos I’ve seen. Ever. This was awesome and hilarious to watch
Thank you Larian for restoring hope in video games once again, and thank you for such an amazing experience!! Happy holidays
That was way funnier than it should have been. Would love to see more of these animations in the future.
You know... an animated show wouldn't hurt
Please, for the love of all that is good in this world...make this a full series.
they got a frigde thats fucked up
Tav(ern)
Это идеально
'Don't even think about licking it'!. Oh behave.
Oh shit I recognize mines of phandelver.  They even added turgs horrible disfigurement
This anime deserves a series, we want more!
1:00 カーラックとシャドウハートがめちゃくちゃ可愛い♡
Santa elf: It wasn't me it was the white dragon born(dark urge)
😂 I would love to hang out with Astarion and the gang
I guess white hair shadow heart is canon
Wait... I wasn't Shadowheart's true desire? This has ruined Christmas!
0:35 why is this so funny
Karlach, sweetheart, you can't bite everything, just, most things and keep living
OH FOH FAHKKK'S SAKE is too iconic
Karlach melting all the snow XD
Please never stop making these Larian. They spark so much joy
god i love karlach
Wyll’s eyes are wondering at 1:50
This Christmas season, I think it’d be healthy for all of us to have Astarion’s level of self esteem. So folks, look yourself in the mirror every morning and say out loud: “By God, I’m beautiful!”
They got a Piece of shit in a box for Christmas
How is no one commenting that Larian can't spell initiative? :D Great video, though!
Why do the characters in Baldurs Gate talk in British English, actually?
Do BG3 with this graphics on Nintendo Switch physical Deluxe edition and I preoder it immediatly. I have PC version and I plan order Deluxe edition for PC on January when I get my paycheck. But I would still buy Switch Deluxe version with this graphics. Because you never can have enough BG3! By the way, I help to the volunteer team translate BG3 into my nativ language and it's amazing. I have almost finished my 1st run but still find just little few books or conversations which I already translate. Absolitely amazing game with so many possibilities and choices.
I did the most evil thing anyone could do. I made astarion a cleric of selèune. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I am the most evil.
Thank you for not being corrupt, Larian. So many other gaming studios and publishers hellbent on nothing but profits, you and your team really made another timeless game with no goal in mind aside from player enjoyment. This is the stuff the gaming industry should strive to be like. No microtransactions, No predatory timed shops, no downloadable "content" that should have been in the base game. You pay for the game, and you get to play the WHOLE game. We as a community need to use this title as the golden standard for what we expect from other large studios. Stop supporting microtransactions, stop buying DLC, stop paying these companies to keep manipulating and abusing you with predatory monetization schemes. Make games what they used to be.
This is how commercial suppose to look like.
Gale getting first initiative? What sorcery is this?
I love how Karlach is melting the snow because of course lol. It’s the small things that always crack me up 😂
Gale's 'The Hot Ones' with Paul Rudd reference!  It's obnoxious asking if I'm the only one who got it, but I don't see a single vomment mentioning it :V
LOVE these animated shorts! Please keep putting more out there. :D
Gods, Larion truly does pay attention. So many of the memes in full display, new stories even just within a small short, adding new content or changing content in response to the fans. *list of reasons to fawn over this game continues*
😂
I'd pay money to watch an entire series of shorts like this 😅❤
huh, I thought this was a fan animation
I need the context for Karlach getting a goddamn Jetski!
3:09 wasn’t it already?
2:57 a series X? If only I could reach through the tiny screen.
Brilliant 😂
Gale "Don't even think about licking it..."😑 Lae'Zel *proceeds to lick it*😛 Gale "Stop!.. I said don't!... Stop that !"😩
LMAO you can hear Lae’zel licking the Xbox in the background 💀💀💀
“Don’t even think about licking it” lmfao
I’m working on buying a gaming pc just to play this game.
This but a fully animated TV series. Please and thank you!
Oh mah gawd, Brett's Phandelver crew is on the left at the start! :D
I wish my files on Xbox cause I lost two play Through
Лариан красавцы! Обожаю вашу игру!
Amazing 🤩
What can I say other than Baldur's Gate 3 is hella ballin. Continue the amazing work guys!!!
😍
Is that Geoff Peterson?! Whatever animator put him in there, I see you. #Assmode
Also Cross-play?
ahahahaah a xbox ahaahh gj
Imagine a Cross-Over event on Amazon Prime with Critical Roll!!! i want, pls
yeah... I'm gonna need at least 5 seasons of 10 episodes of this... for Lore purposes of course, nothing selfish
Okay, just got the game today, haven't seen a single smedge of gameplay, and I already adore the characters, that's impressive.   update: Got around to playing the game, it's awesome.
卡姐在下沉哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈
Lame
Lets goooo! Whats next for larian studios?
I love how this implies that Karlach had plugged the Xbox in before taking a bite out of it XD
We need a full series of these!! A full baldurs gate 3 cartoon series
This is a show I'd watch on netflix for sure.
Ok, call that fake a fake but the dude gave them things that they would find useful.
I would honestly watch this, ON YOUTUBE. NOT NEFLIX BECAUSE NEFLIX SUCKS. Like if done right, this could be a really good animated series for adults.
Could litterally watch a million of these. You guys are so good at writing believable characters.
Karlach in the snow 🤣😍 also, I expected my character to show up somehow, which doesn't make sense but shows how that game lives in my head rent-free.
SWEN VINCKR IS CANON IN BG3??? AND HES DEAD???
LOL You guys must feel like Conan the Barbarian sitting on a throne of skulls after having taken the world by storm and pretty much went from underdog to kings of the world.
And your choice for the voice cast was spot on. Please bring them all back if you happen to do a sequel, please. So awesome. I love them all.
I mean look at all these reviews Sven!!! You don't get any ratings below like 95%! Everyone loves it, even the staunchest of critics! Nobody hates it. I haven't run into anyone who isn't talking good about this game! You guys did everything RIGHT for this game. You didn't rush it. You didn't force it. You took your time and made this one of the best games of all time. It took about 4 years of development or so, but you took your TIME. You rushed NOTHING. That's the sign of a good developer. Plus, you're one of us! Its good to know you're a hardcore gamer like us and detest the same things we detest (microtransactions and pay to win bullshit) and love the same things we love (having millions and millions of choices that all affect your outcome!) Its so fun! This is everything Elder Scrolls WISHES it could be. Todd Howard looks at this game with envy and is crying lol - imagine how he's feeling about Starfield vs Baldur's Gate 3. Look at that broken mess Starfield how it plays vs how Baldur's Gate 3 plays. Dude, Starfield ran like crap and looked like barely upgraded Fallout, ran choppy and poorly optimized. But Baldurs Gate 3 ran good on my old RX570s under ultra 1080p 60+fps... I recently upgraded my gpu though, now that I got an RX7600 I can play 4k ultra detail - smooth too I might add, under Vulkan. You guys really did an excellent job. Beautiful artwork, beautiful gameplay, beautiful everything, beautiful story. It is just awesome. This is how video game development should be. This is an example of QUALITY. All other video game developers need to take note. They all just got clobbered by an indie developer that out the gates became AAAA and showed them all up. Great job Sven, keep your company going, we need more games from your company!!!
Looks like Larian took the RPG crown away from Square Enix. Larian is hands down the best RPG video game company of all fucking time. Baldurs Gate 3 will be remembered as probably the best RPG of all time, and probably one of the best games of ANY genre of ALL TIME all-together. You guys put your souls and hearts into this. Sven you did great - you absolutely love Dungeons and Dragons, but not only that, you love us, the fans. Thank you for not bogging down this game with microtransactions and bullcrap. You guys are doing the whole world a favor by shaking up the video game industry and rattling cages and showing these big AAAA companies that indie developers can make better games than they can! You guys showed the world when you won game of the year. Best RPG developer of all time. Best DnD game so far to date. Best RPG I've ever played. Better than Final Fantasy 7, even. Better than Elder Scrolls, the entire series. Better than Chrono Trigger (in my opinion) and I love all those games. I think this is one of the first games I've dumped 300 hours into and still come back to it like its brand new when I play it. Its that engaging. I love this game you guys. Sven you're the man dude. Thank you so much for this passion project, all of you at Larian ROCK - thanks for showing us DnD fans some love and for keeping this series alive and not letting it die. Thank you so so much. I needed this so bad.
God I love this
I love you Larian. Never change. Please.
All im getting from this is that you guys need to make a full animated show.
Geoff seems nice
we love you larian ❤❤
0:09: Is that, Tails, Sonic, Amy and Knuckles?! LMAO
Karlach melting the snow lmao
This is what the Party does when Tav's not around Also, how is Astarion not dead since snow is water
The dedication to those shorts, the level of detail put in it, all the little things you only catch when you watch it like the 4th or 5th time like "The Blood of Swen Vincke" or the reason for the power outage being that Karlach bites the cable in the background, Shadowhearts immedeatly followed almost unhearable cute "...h...heal.."....  Damn it, takes notes EA, Ubisoft, Blizzard, Activision and all those other "Triple A" studios that have dissappointed us so often in the past years, TAKE NOTES:  THIS is what true love and dedication to your game looks like!  Thank you Larian, bravo!
No one is going to mention the Paul Rudd reference with Gale and "his look at us"line. https://youtu.be/ZbLcY0XeVY4?si=tYx774oXCaiWukL9
WOOOOOOW!!! Thak you!) You are THE BEST!
Go forth hero, play Baldur’s Gate 3  https://youtu.be/fs6CldOCQiI?si=Z_S0le3k6kAVmEaO
why was the only undead vampire of ther group tbe coldest??? hes undead he cant feel the cold
I'm glad Larian is embracing how wonderful Karlach is
😂😂😂 "oh for fuck sake!" same Astarion...same 😂😂😂
1:51
We need a DLC in Neverwinter with a level cap increase in 2024.
Karlach just freaking bites the cord. I love this video
Спасибо вам большое за вашу работу,в которую в вкладываете душу, желаю вам  и дальнейших успехов ❤
Спасибо вам большое за вашу работу,в которую в вкладываете душу, желаю вам  и дальнейших успехов ❤
I NEED LIKE A FULL MINI SERIES WITH ALL THE SHENANIGANS PRETTY PLEASE
Wow, this is amazing!
I'm a bit lost. The hard copy for PS5 - when will it be published?
Good for the X people! You shouldn´t miss out!
Wait, is that a dice with just ones on it? Nice one! Loving this. (everything else seemed to be in the comments, but I did not scroll far enough :D )
I love Laezel
The vampire saying "oh for fucks sake" killed me.
Console gaming is finished. Hope bill gates payed you guys alot for that ad those.
its best game in the world
No one's talking about the "heal~" from Shadowheart at the end.
Who is Geoffrey?
let me me marry Karlach >:(
This is too perfect i love Karlach and Wyll's interaction 😂. Larlach is animated so perfectly 😂❤️
0:47 I laughed at Karlach melting the snow more than I probably should have.
well, i think Baldur 3 looks and feels much better in animation style than game with dat damn rolls system.
Plase add cut content larian :'( we always get the bad ending with karlach.
0:18 "who would've thought?" "Not me!"
"Oh, FFS!!"   Astarion is king of this.
The Elf girl might not want it but I do lol 2:54
I love Larian. Guys released the game but keep the extra stuff going! I love it!
Well least we know wylls true love
Shall we appreciate the fact that moment of Wyll unpacking his present is the most rewatched moment of the video?
Wyll got a pretty good gift not gonna lie.
Karlach out here like it's Fiber Optic Friday  At least she didn't lick it.
Had such a wonderful time at the inn. Thank you :3
Don't stop. I love these. Larian should commission yall for a short series of act one.
Apply here if you get the Geoff reference and are chuffed about it. :D
I am still shock about how the others versions got replace with the new ones  like nothing and yet they still dont care at all about their others versions but l guess here doesnt matter at all 😢
"Build it and they will come" - Field of Dreams  A most Heartfelt thank you is in order. I have been a fan of your games for years. IN AN AGE where quality storytelling, character depth, passion, craftsmanship, community, respect for the medium, attention to detail, reverance to artistic expression, exploration of the human condition, compelling narrative, fantastical world building, multifaceted gameplay mechanics, masterful musical & sound implementation, respect of player feedback, transparency, exemplary leadership, clear direction, clear vision, clear goals, achievable targets,  understanding your audience, remaining grounded, ARE PERPETUALLY OUT OF REACH for most developers in the gaming industry & entertainment industry at large YOU @LARIANSTUDIOS, have created Boulder's Gate 3. You proved that it can be done. You have  proven that if you build a game wholeheartedly gamers will come. You have proven beyond shadow of a doubt the formula for success lies not in the pursuit of profit but in the pursuit of excellence within an industry. Make the BEST game you can possibly make and strive for higher excellence with each iteration. There was a time that this was the fundamental principle that drove the manufacturing & creation of everything we built. If you manufactured cars, you manufactured the best you could. If you made movies you made the best you could, if you built skyscrapers you built the best you could. We built things to last, we built things with pride. We understood that only those who wholeheartedly strive to achieve perfection in everything they built woud be able to seize success to become the standard of quality by which all others would be meassure. We the consumers, thusly knew who to trust and the products they made by virtue of  name alone. It is my sincere wish that for 2024 and beyond you continue to be the beacon of excellence, resolute, grounded, ever mindful of the formula for success you have rightfully zeised for it is not a new formula it is simply forgotten. One that the modern corporate world at large chooses to actively ignore, disprove, sabotage, undermine, devalue, underestimate. Looking forward with much anticipation for your next grand adventure.    Thank you from the bottom of my heart  A fan FDCM
I can't believe how well these animated shorts capture the feel of a real tabletop game of D&D.
Can you guys turn this into an actual netflix series? 😂
2:26 "Initative" 😆  Also I will personally crowdfund a full season of this.
karlach melting through the snow is such a great detail
Omg the Phandelver crew at the beginning 10/10
2:59  lae'zel : another mysterious box   gale : don't even think about licking it   lae'zel licking it 🤣  10/10
I need this to become a series it’s PERFECTION
Sylvester, Tommy, Gabriel, and what remains of Turg spotted.  Really funny animation, love it
I think I have watched this at least two dozen times at this point
they cant be fucked to fix the god damn save bug
"don't even think about licking it" They know what we like
Id love if they made a baldurs gate short series
I wish i still had the drive to finish this game, but in all honesty i lost the mood to play bg3 after reaching the city.
you are EPIC Larian!!!
Apparently, chewing through a plugged in power cord is not that life threatening. A certain, formerly teething, hellhound can attest to that. It slew many an electronic before it was discovered.
lol in my game (only just started on Xbox) - Shadowheart just killed Lae’Zel lol (I’m not a fan of the GITHYANKI and not interested in their quests at all 😂
Now *this* is how you advertise smth. Karlach is still best girl change my mind.
I dont like this game. It's just grand theft auto, redead redamption, that type player base targeted game with sword and sorcery. Not a dnd game like baulder gates 1, 2, ice wind dale, never winter, temple of elemental evil. nope this is just another hip hop rap music targeted genre audience game using my game's title.
I'd pay money to watch an animated series, with the original VAs, of these guys. I love them all SO much! Also, Shadowheart singing "Healsss!" at the end, after Karlach bit the cord, is so funny to me! lol
I have repeated Astarion's FFS! so many times and i laugh every time!! XD
For the love of- Just make a TV series already. Everyone would love it.
Can we get a Saturday morning series out of this? It might bring me back to life!
Thank you for one of the best games I’ve ever played… but…   We did it… we have you game of the year… now give us the 20 race dlc.
Every time i see a short, even when they said the wouldnt... I pray for a DLC, or even a Free expansion (let me dream kay!) I'd really like to see snow in BG3
Karlach melting the snow made me lol
Spin-off BG3 anime? ... Spin-off BG3 anime please!
So them getting an Xbox means they were on the naughty list j/k.😂 Anyways, it's a great RPG and the Xbox crowd will love it.👍
I can never thank these voice actors enough for giving life to these characters
I love this. Amazing work. Also, makes for some perfect GIF material as well.
Space heater Karlach had me cackling
Now if only they’d fix this issue of Xbox saves being randomly deleted. I just lost a 100+ hour campaign.
LOL incredible
Did you really cram some gender ideology into your Christmas Xbox commercial? Hoo boy.
That’s amazing.
nice
lol no one wants a shitbox for christmas
Yes please more of these
FULL SERIES PLS
Damn the animator REALLY leaned into the "thicc tomboy karlach" here
It's party time!!!  P-A-R-T-WHY???  CAUSE I GOTTA!!!
pls pls petition to make this a web series or show
Ojalá una misión para salvar a santa sería 10/10
Loved it till it was an ad.
There's so many little details that just do it for me in this masterpiece.  1: Karlach melting through the snow 2: Lae'zel watching Karlach melt through the snow. 3: Karlach being caked up. 4: Astarion and Lae'zel being the only one's unimpressed by Santa's bag. 5: Gale telling Lae'zel to stop licking the Xbox off screen
3:44 IS that a Craig Ferguson call out?
I would totally curl up with some eggnog and happily watch an entire series with these guys.
Love to see the world of I.O mines of phandelver crew in the left side
Who the hell plugged it in???
Running through this video for the 5th time. . . . . Wish I could say the same for the game. Too much game and too little time!
I'm only here because my boys Sylvester Turg Tommy and Gabriel are here
i totally would binge watch a serious anime about baldursgate 3
Seeing PC's from Brett's Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign was a completely unexpected, but welcome surprise. Love Larian even more now.
I got your Christmas gift. All my 50h+ saves were deleted on XBOX. FIX THE ISSUE!!!
Oh so y'all like spent money on this instead of more balance patches to improve the game to the point where save-scumming is an option, not required?  word, word.
Lmao Astarion and Gale are 🐐s
Where is the Lemond?
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK ISSO TA MUITO BOM
These characters are all so lovely c:
Love how it's a big commercial for the Xbox release...and yet it's well thought out, lore accurate & funny.
man i want to play Baldur's Gate 3
All that choice and not one of the party wished for cross-play :(
Гейл красава самый одыкватный мужик
How can I love this game so much and not fit in with fan base at all
Now that's a Christmas special
Karlach will always be my Bae!
i would watch the F out of this cartoon.
I am pretty sure I speak for most in this comment section when I say....we want more...WAY more of this.
Hilarious
01:53  👀
How the voices so accurate? :O
<3
The animation is soooo beautiful, cute and fun!!! Love all the work u guys do 💖 would love to see more lol
Astarion steals the entire short, I love it!
Shout out to my homie Gale
We all know we want a full animated series of the BG3 original cast!
Nice to see Geoff Peterson got a job after his run on The Late Late Show.
It's Thomas the goblin slayer! I've been watching the lost mines hardcore game
Its Great!
All I want is shadowheart pin up so I get ya warlock
This is genius
did you fuck the bear yet?
where the fuck is minthara?
Lmao the greatest gift of all; released on Xbox. Nice animation. I ordered a physical copy for my Series X. Waiting for it to come in the mail
Karlach's unrepentant monch on the cord is peak Barbarian and I love it.
1:54
ok but Astarion's "Oh good, I have an excuse to murder" face at 2:27
I would 100% watch this show lmao
Wow this is great 😂
Someone passed a perception check? It must be a Christmas miracle.
That thing with Mizora is pretty messed up. I don't get how is it supposed to be funny
I’m traumatized no thank you.
why did karlach bite the cord? lmfao
This goes to show that Wyll is the main character and hero of the story lmaoo.  At first I’ve always found him very boring, until playing the game as him through his eyes. He legit has hero plot armor  As for everyone else, this short perfectly catches each of their characters wonderful. I can’t stop smiling hahaaaa
Now all I need it the Xbox x/s
Come to daddy? I thought she was Mama K
We need a full web series please Larian
Now if only you could play it on Xbox without the save bug deleting all your saves...
Gale with the boots 💀 Ugh, best devs ever
I love how much you guys love your fans
I love how chaotic they all are. 😂 Larian and all the VA’s did such a wonderful job on this game and all these little treasure you bless us with. ❤
Would there be crossplay with consoles?
I don't know how many times I've watched this but it's not enough
love it so much and funny i want watch more animated BG3
I like the sonic and gang reference in the beginning at the tavern
welp, i knew i didn't like this game but considering the lack of playable kobolds and them making tired old "santa but evil" jokes i now know I'll never like the game
HAHA muito bom
Shadowheart on karlachs arm 😂😂
❤❤❤
Now you have to do a series.  Your own fault Larian Studios.
I'd sacrifice the grove for more of these animated shorts 😂😂😂
This is the best christmas special of all times
This seems to be inspired by clash of clans short animations. Love It!
Note to self. Give Lae'zel a mindflayer head.
funny how this was kinda leaked by themselves at the game awards?
0:54 xdxdxd
Larian studios is what blizzard used to be: for gamers by gamers.
larian + adult swim?
0:59 Me on the left
So, the horned man wanting a "poster" is a cannon event
Worst Baldurs Gate Ever 🎉
I LOVE IT SM
Typical sexist Larian Studios the females wearing sweet stuff all 😂😂😂
"Don't even think about licking it" If you know, you know. :P
This game was so incredible  Also need to shout out to divinity original sin 1 and 2. Absolutely love these games. Thank you for all the memories larian
que grandes me encanta hasta la publicidad de este estudio. os quiero Larian Estudios.
Whats the lore with Lae and Skelleton Geoff?
This is awful, how are starfield fanboys supposed to hate on the game now that it’s available on Xbox????
Geoff☠️
Gods damn it, you guys are great! :D
Oh man I love games that have zoophilia
Astarions such a drama Queen
I really want this animations as a series or mini series. I would pay for this, it´s awesome
And now I need an animated series with this cast.
Let's be real. Some infernal engine oil is EXACTLY what Karlach needs.
Damn-it, Wyll... It's okay to take a breather!  Evil can wait!
MY BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT
Fantastic!!!
Lol even for an advert I still love it. Y’all rock keep the vibe going. Happy Holidays to everyone at Larian Studios and Ty for an amazing game.
too bad its not on gamespass, I not going to buy it again :)
That's the good way to present some new stuffs...Larian I love you
Karlach canonically counters winter.
We love your game and you guys too! Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!
CROSSPLAY NEEDED
gale eating an enchanted boot is the best thing ive seen all day
I'd watch a season and a half of this.
"reach within and claim your price" Yep, romance option.
As much as I really would love to see a full show about these guys, it's not likely. Time constraints, budget, etc.  Maybe just a small animation like this every once in a while?
I would kill for a full animated show like this
Larian is the literal fucking best
Is that... a Team Fortess 2 logo easter egg, on the top level of the tavern!?
I need a animated series of BGIII now plz
Now all I want is a 12 episode season of the adventures of our favorite party from Faerûn in animated form.
the "oh for fucks sake" from astarion is golden
Epic!!!!!
Gale: "Don't even think about licking this." .... Lae'zel: *slurping background noises*
Alright...we've got one for PC, one for PS5, and one for Xbox...next up is cloud-based for the switch ;) !!!
Ruined by xbox plug sadly
0:36 is going to be my new text message notification tone I swear 😂
Oh how I wish you could travel with all of these at the same time. Would be so much fun!
Needs to be a full series!
you're all so talented that this could become a full series, thank you so much for this present ❤
Will you stop licking the damn thing?!
AMAZING I NEED MORE LOL BRAVO!
Can you please kickstart a 6 - 8 episode series, with our favorite characters?
But like can we get an animated series of the cast just galivanting around doing random bullshit?
Larian studios is the best and I like that they stuck with the game and not give us a unfinished game
3:01 dead spider reference?
Fantastic little comedy adventure!  The VAs are as on-point as always, the animations manage to not only keep up with them but add to the feel of the line reads, all of the visual (and audio) gags are hilarious and/or adorable, and all in all it's a wonderful good time.  I really hope we keep getting more of these.  The ongoing goofy adventures of the party are good fun. ^v^
Whomever plays the vampy sounds like him spot on lol
Enorme! Ils sont fou chez Larian :-)
Karlach sinking into the snow is the best thing I've seen all year.
Hilarianous !
LOLz so nice
A need a complet season series of this.
Благодарю яндекс перевод
Who else caught the 2 seconds of boris's "battle music 3" when initiatives were rolled 😂
“Don’t even think about licking it” (sounds Lae’zel licking x-box off screen)
Merry Christmas all, please don’t forget Palestine. The land of Bethlehem and home of Jesus Christ ❤
weirdest bit is not seeing my toon. really such a strange feeling. like a party i wasn't invited to.
The DLC we didn’t know we needed
Karlach ❤
Люблю эту студию!!! Этот ролик просто шикарен!!!!
Honestly hearing the voice actors like this makes this 10x better!! Truly, I enjoyed this because of them! ♡
Thank you for these awesome shorts.
Don’t even think about licking it lmfao
How i wish it would be an animated series on netflix sometimes))
1:54 finally a good part
Enjoyed the unexpected love for Grant Imahara!
Is it *all* just pansexual furries?
0:08 did they just slap in sonic characters in the bg??? Or am I just going crazy and those are just regular guys?
They should do more skits, but have a different version of Tav in it. Like one skit a female tiefling bard, the next have a male dwarf paladin. Stuff like that
The games great guys besides some of the bugs that causes dead things to stand upright and breathe after being thrown first time I saw that I laughed my ass off 😂
Wait hol up.HOL UP LARIAN STUDIOS. Does that mean Wyll secretly has a crush on Mizora...and because it's your animation...DOES IT MEAN IT'S CANON?
Wie gut ist das denn bitte 🤣 Top Quali in allem! 😍
3:15 The cute little "heeal!" was perfect 😂
Thank you LS
Larian : Merry Christmas!!!🎅
funny as the first plane of hell!
This should be on Netflix as a animated series IMO.
I see Shadowheart took the Selune route.
The Tavern is amazing. They got Hardcore Phandelver from Io-verse and others in here. Love you Larian!
Oh Gale, still on "Lick Police" duty. Where's his adventurous holiday spirit?
Karlach biting into the cord at the end 😂
Did they actually make a physical copy?
The Mizora pic 😂
Yuck
:)
Why isn't this being made instead of a live action. I want more of this. Animation can really bring out the absurdity of the game that live action can never do.
Karlach immediately biting the power cord just feels right
Why did I think the Santa elf would turn out to be Ketheric? lol
I love it.
So.... When are we getting an animated series?  I don't even need a season long plot... I'd be happy with just our favorite adventurers having one-shots every week.
I haven't even played your game and i love your you tube videos...merry Christmas
Its a Christmas miracle
Merry Christmas ☃️🎄 Who also wants to have Shadowheart as reallife wife? ❤
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!
X-box?  Related to X-mas, perhaps?
Just fit he game yesterday and I obviously romanced Shadow Heart.
So good xD...
I don't play the game but thought this was just a hilarious take from some fan, whoever made this is a genius, best official animation ever??? 😂
Okay, gotta admit that drew a chuckle out of me... Though I didn't picture Karlach as a cat (biting the power cord)... ^_^
This is the kind of adaptation that I wish netflix would adopt. Animated with the OG Voice cast. Anyone else & I wouldn't watch.
"Contained in this bag, is your truest heart's desire." I just realized the reason Karlach got oil wasn't because she wanted it. It was her engine heart that wanted it.
Astarian on Karlachs lap 😂
1:52 Larian, you knew what you were doing there... and we are all happy with your choice in animation.                 dommy mommy :3
Each dice has their own initative number, gotta love that attention to detail!  Merry Christmas everyone!
everyone else is freezing, Karlarch just chilling.
Karlach slowly sliding down as she melts the snow, with absolutely no reaction from anyone, is so incredible.
Wait I thought vampires resisted cold?
Now give us crossplay already!
"Don't even think about licking it" was such an unmentioned gem
Hoping for cross play next!!
Holy shit the mind of phandelver hard core team is hear yes😊❤
the fact that karlach was melting through the snow lol, oh and also i think we all know who mashed's favorite shadowheart path is judging by their hair in every single one of these
So if I got this right, a Redcap attacked and ate Santa, his elves, and his reindeer before the party showed up.
Ok I don't understand the skeleton with Lae'zel
The animation style reminds me of Gendy Tartakovsky.
Karlach calling herself Daddy is unfair to me and my fellow lesbians 🥺
Give me MORE! MORE!! MORE!!! of Larian Studio's Baldur's Gate 3 animated shorts!
Love you guys
Креативно и забавно! =)
I haven't been able to play longer than 45 minutes at a time before getting a hard crash. Even on the lowest graphics settings. Im running a rx580. Plz help
God these animations are so well done.
I like how Karlach’s first idea after seeing a cored it to eat it, she really let the intrusive thoughts win
Lae’zel is so stinking cute
More please... make this a  TV show
Yaaay now on limit xbox xD
I Love you Larian Studios 💙
We need more animation, a New Year's special perhaps.  Then after that a Spring special, and then after than a Summer Special, and so on.  Then to top it all off a sequal to BG3 with the same Origin PCs!  Woot Woot!
I love Shadowheart saying heals at the end.
You guys should really make a series out of this...
Official? Lol kek realized at last moment
A skeleton with a name tag that says Geoff? Seems to me someone is a fan of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson!
Karlach has cheeks for days 🍑👀
Inside the bag is your hearts truest desire!  Everyone else: 🤩🤩🤩  Astarion and Laezel: Maximum sideye
WHERE IS HALSIN
0:54 Karlach melting through the snow is a nice touch xD
Karlach sinking into the snow made me laugh, Lae'zel *watching* Karlach sink into the snow made me laugh so hard I choked 😂
1:53 GAHHH DAYUM
😚🤌 Dammit! Now I gotta do another run through. 🤣
That BretUltimus Mines of Phandelver crew cameo, tho!
Where is Halsin lol
Did anyone else notice the hardcore phandelver party in the front left in the very beginning?
@2:36 ...was funny from the beginning but hit a stride right here! lol! Wow!
pls fix the bugs on xbox. there’s kind of alot. still great game tho.
I love how the voice actors have really embraced all these beloved characters
feels like a missed opportunity for a solid 'dick in a box' spin off
does this mean santa is canon
Gale eating a boot, Karlach melting things and a happy Bae'zel... top tier.
I love gale eating boots and shadowheart cuddling karlak
I NEED the show. Done just like this ❤
i would probably pay for a whole ass series of this
Love it
That's an AD. But I like it.
This was great! I can watch a bunch of these shorts! 😂😂😂
1:54 nice animations on her rear
thanks
This is fucking stupid thank you for making it
I could watch this 1000x  Really wish Larian would turn this into a series, I’d pay good money for it
lmfao that was great
karlach plz step on me
Karlach being HOT and adorable is just spoiling us...
So basically vox machina Not I am complaining I love the show the more the merrier The burning one sounds like a grog Never play the game but will as soon as there’s a sale
Love the Geoff cameo! 😂💀
3:00 Stop licking the damn thing!
This needs to be a real tv show . I DEMAND IT
A Cristmas Gith
that was awsome
This is hilarious 😂   But how did you misspell "initiative" six times? 😊
I would die for a series of shorts like this. Just them on adventures
An IO verse reference?!??!? Count me in!
*wishing I could play Baldur's Gate 3, intensifies*
I haven't played Baldur's Gate 3 and probably never will, I simply don't have time. But I do recognize how much love and care has gone into the game and all its characters. You deserve the praise.
0:36 sassylly done🎉
A wonderful Christmas gift! I downloading it now! Thank you! Merry Christmas!
This was the smartest and most entertaining way to advertise a console release legends the lot of you
Please make modding better in the next patch, pretty please
This has a clone wars 2003 animation vibe, very cool 🤔🦊
Karlach melting the snow did it for me. 😆
Love it! (Was I the only one wondering why my custom avatar wasn’t in it…? lol!)
Geoff! Before he got his shiny eyes!
Please!! Subs Spanish or English
Just want to say that the animation is great and that it's pretty fun to see the characters getting up to more stuff
Okay, Asterion sitting on Karlach's lap to keep warm feels like one of those things he'll deny ever having happened but Shadowheart and Karlach will never let him forget it. Commercials are allowed to exist if they are this fun. 10/10 love this❤
0:08 Hey wait a second, I know those two in the top left corner from The Obsidian Archives. Did not expect to see them here. o.o
Te quiero mucho, Larian
Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 are not only RPGs that utterly raised the CRPG bar, they're how I met my wife; I have truly cherished memories of playing through them with her. We both assumed, for our own sakes, that BG3 couldn't live up to their legacy and were content to just ignore the hype.  We were mistaken. BG3 raises the goddamn bar _again._
haha, nice!
Why no minthara
Of course he wanted Mizora 😂
Why don't they just kill the tieflings in every animation?
Just when I think I can’t love Larian and the BG3 cast more than I already do…
Can some kind people please explain to me why is this Santa-elf was bad?
Best Christmas special ever
we love you folks
Dont even think about licking it!! Love Larian knowing all the memes
look at us... look at us
You guys... 😂😂😂😂😂
@2:32 😭😭😭🥰🐾 KITTY
This is too wholesome for my poor heart…! Haaaa im soon to be vaporized blood flesh and bones!
If they'd just known christmas traditions... It's quite common that you get presents someone thinks you would really like, but you'll have to keep smiling and pretend. Socks, atinking after shave, xBox-Versions of games you should best play on PC.... Useless crap, but in the end it is about making them think you are happy, no?
who did the voice of santa? his voice is so familiar!
Asterian, is my Guy, I am currently using him in my 4th play through
Omg! 0:09 Looks like Sonic, Tails, Amy and Knuckles formed a party! Larian, you rock!
You guys deserve all the love just for this game because it just hits I can't wait for the next game you guys make because I know it'll have a fun expansive game that's paired with funny and unique characters I wish you the best and congratulations on game of the year
I was putting off finishing the game so i could wrap it up for Christmas. It was a god choice
I love it, I love it, I looooove it. Did I mention, I LOVE IT! <3 <3 <3
This is hilarious and perfect. Well done, Larian and co!
I'll take Wyll's gift!
I hope they'll never stop comissioning these videos. I love them.
I would legitimately watch an entire show like this.
1:54 a cake too hot for frosting
Loved this!!!😂❤❤😂
You know if commercials had fun animation and or stories Involving fun characters and such to promote a product that would be a fun way of consuming commercials and it would almost certainly result in more sales. When you try harder on something to make it more entertaining you more then likely get a better return, who knew lol
This could be a legitimate show 😂 God I laughed
The only way Astarion is ever going to survive in any of my playthrough's is if I play him, and I'll never play him. Such a prententious twat.
i wanna play BG3 with my Nine Inch Nails tengu sWitch console.
I have to apoligize, but damn Karlach's proportions are making me act up.
Genius
I love how Larian embraces community memes by making Gale eat a magic boot and making Bing Bong canon
I swear to god that’s sonics gang in the beginning
I saw the characters of Lost Mines of Phandelver by DM Brettultimus😂😂
Can we have an entire show of this please?? I would pay so much money for a series of the og voice cast Vox Machina style
The only ad id ever watch multiple times. God tier game studio
this was really cute larian
okay, now Larian has to produce an actual animated series for Baldur's Gate 3. I need it.
For the love of god make this a series!
this was pretty great. time to get an xbox so i. can play it ...
I have awful memory and only one playthrough of BG3. Could someone please tell me what's the character of Santa-like elf? Why did he kill those goblins? Did I miss a relevant questline in the game?
Amazing 😂
Ngl, wouldn't mind a signed pic of Mizora myself, best girl imo
Guys, srsly, stop this. You are TOO good, this simply cant be true.   ps oh and those intiative rolls really got me.
Karlach would be the one to pull a Christmas Vacation cat
Спасибо большое за всю вашу работу ❤
Merry Christmas everyone! Thank you for making one of the best games I’ve ever played!
6 person party is what we need in Honor mode. You know without modding the game. lol good commercial.
God I would pay good money for a streaming service containing only one show, being this as a full show
"Don't even THINK about licking it" I am DYING
Gale eating a shoe 😂
This is jampacked full of perfect lae'zel moments
More please!
Yes it is out okay. What is more important: Crossplatform/crossplay???
Larian constantly throwing these Gems at us, they've given me the one thing I wanted all year with BG3 and now we got this Christmas Gem of an Animation, truly the Gifters that keep on giving.
This needs to be a series
3:03 Mom Kar is the best of all <3
What an elaborate ad. Well done .
Never change karlach never change
I am amazed at how much content Larian continues to give us. Their passion for this game is palpable.
This is so precious!!! Love it
BEST ANIMATION OF CHRISTMAS!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU LARIAN
Love the homage to the lost mines of phandelver hardcore party
Can't believe they had Gale eating a boot with a knife and fork
Woo! As an Xbox player who's been waiting this might be the best Christmas present and announcement yet! Ty sven clause!
Love seeing these short of most if not all the characters together. A short animated series would be amazing
The fact that there are characters from different D&D groups like for example Lost Mines of Phandelver run by BrettUltimus really warms my heart, great job Larian!
1:54
I cannot think of another game that had so many wonderful characters who have such distinct personalities that have made such an impression on the gaming world, well except for Wyll.
Fabulous 😂
Man the attention to details. Karlach melting snow, having Astarion and Shadowheart cuddle to her for warmth, Karlach's "Heart desires" infernal engine oil... so good.
You guys fix the save files deleting yet?
Astarion and Shadowheart cuddling up with Karlach😂😂
Классный мультик ♥
We need this show wtf
This is soooo good. I want a complete Series with original Voices. Please. Thnka you.
absolute... great :)
I did not expect to see Tommy, turg, silvester and gabriel at the start there lol Made me double take there
This is one of the best things I’ve ever seen.
Downvote this BLAM!
Yeah hey can you not recommend bullshit to me that I didn't like or subscribe to or watch anything related to about at all ever in my account thanks
Jokes on you, all of those guys are dead.
Everything about this was amazing! Astarion sitting on Karlacks lap angrily and shadow heart cuddles up. Then Gale saying ‘don’t even thing about licking that’ Larian is probably one of the company’s with the most relatable, relaxed, and funny content
I too wish to cozy up to Karlach in cold weather
And here I was really hoping that Karlach was going to pull out her final heart upgrade 😭
DAMNIT now i want to play BG3...but i dont have the initiative roll required 😢
I wish I could take all my companion to the party, I don't want to leave anyone behind
The "oh fucks sake" from astarion is *chefs kiss*
Well, xbox fans there, ya go enjoy. Hey, this was amazing. I've never seen another company do this! Merry Christmas to all the nerd heads like me.
WAIT IS THIS A 'DONNER PARTY' JOKE?!
Shadowheart leaning into karlach was so precious
“Don’t even think about licking it”      *slurp*   “Stop that”
Haven’t even played Baldurs Gate and I still luv this.
HOLY IS THAT SILVESTER, TOMMY, TURG, AND GABRIEL FROM IO?! ayooo!
Omg larian. What a way to advertise Xbox release. You guys are truly genius
GOTY BABYYYY!!!!!
I like how the red deamon woman looks/is build and think
"Don't even think about licking it", lol!  Gale didnt overcome those spider legs
I want a whole show with these guys. If Vox Machina can get one, why not them?
God, the meme references
There is no point in playing the because the game deletes you saved game when you turn off your Xbox
thats the best possible way yall could have revealed that lol. thats awesome
We need Durge!!! Where's our precious little bhaal-babe?
Why is a vampire shivering in the cold?
This was so beautiful. I loved the animation. And congrats to the Xbox family for finally getting to experience this beauty of a game!
Was that a hot ones reference in the beginning with Gale? It was exactly what I at Paul Rudd said in his hot ones interview.
Sugoi. ;-;
Should I really be suprised that gale is eating ANOTHER magic item
I would much rather prefer getting it latter on xbox than dealing with save files disappearing bug 😢😢 The animatic is really cute though ❤
Calarts humor, calarts animation. Gross
Glad to Geoff from the Craig Ferguson show could stop by
God I love Karlach please matey me lol
Thank you for making such a great fucking game!
Now *THAT* is how you do an announcement trailer!
i love all the details with the fire and the snow interactions.
Are those the boots mentioned in the one-shot D&D campaign?
lol Gale’s “Don’t even think about licking it”
Can we just get a Baldurs gate show
How has no one recognized or appreciated the Craig Ferguson reference yet?!? Hell yeah to Geoff
Omg please We need a adult animated series of this asap! It would be amazing! 🙏🙏
Now that's just silly.
You guys are amazing. Your game is amazing
Astarion being the most extra about the cold weather and Gale literally eating a boot made me scream laugh 😂
It’s the Karla’s biting into power cord 😂
I would literally kill for a system that could play BG3 😭  It looks like a game crafted with so much love.. I really need more games where the love of the art is more apparent than the stains of greed. I usually feel like you only find that in indie games these days.
Ok yes but it came out for Xbox on the December 7th. When’s cross-play? I wanna play with my non-pc friends 😢
Have a nice new year everyone. All the best and love and of course Cheese :3
Every single time I see a notification from Larian, it's a smile and a little cheer! This was hilarious, Karlach peeking over the snowbank and slowly sinking had me laughing far too much!
0:09 was not expecting Sylvester, Gabriel, Turg, and Tommy to just be chillin in a Larion skit, LOVE IT!
I love how Karlach is basicaly another camp fire :D
Karlach melted through the snow... i cant.
I love how this is official content by Larion and not just fan animation.
Fix your game
Hahahahahahaahaha!! Great reference with Geoff!!
Supporting the crap box is such a waste of resources. Most owners buy game keys for countries with very weak currencies at incredibly low prices. (E.g. BG3 Deluxe for about 15€ a few days after release). Then they redeem the keys using VPN which is a loophole Microsoft stubbornly refuses to close. In the end the devs/publishers can never make as much money from the games as they projected and are driven into takeovers or GamePass (yuck!) to make ends meet. Boo! Limit yourself to PlayStation and PC if you’re clever.
The idea of Wyll being the only hero in their group, dragging them on quests is perfect
I hope they never stop making these and it turns into an actual series.
genius!
Probably the Best Game Studio in many many years
Xbox player here. 9 hours in, still at act 1, this game is fucking awesome
Don't even think of licking it
I would watch a show with all of them. Holy cow these are so well done. Blown away every time.
Bravo …. Thanks for making gaming fun again 😂🎉
LMFAOOOO
Where is Dark Urge Where   Ps Cool film 😁
If only we had 6 character parties like in this episode 😢
I’m happy to see this but also sad to see my character wasn’t invited to the Christmas Party.  I wonder what I did we all seemed so chill in the game
Ok that was cool
This needs to be more than a special I would love to see this turned into a show
LOVE IT <3
That Sean Evans and Paul Rudd reference is gold!
Xbox 🤢🤢🤢🤢
I was not ready to immediately be assaulted by Gale as Paul Rudd during Hot Ones.
"Another mysterious box." "Don't even think about licking it!"  Is licking boxes something Lae'zel's prone to doing?
Thank you so much Larian, not just for this but also for one of the best games yet. ❤
1:41 predictable 5th ed.
Can’t believe no one is talking about „don’t even think of licking it!“ 3:01
I love this. Edit: This reminds me of the OLD Overwatch VA's, who just managed to have so much fun with the community, and I really am grateful that, that feeling is back, although, with another game, people and company. Never change please Larian!
I really hate just how much when Karlach bit the wire, I 100% would have done so as well xD (I romanced her, if anything we'd be biting it together xD)
BG3 and Larian for the win...yet again !
Sexy
Karlach not feeling cold like the others was expected, the melting of the snow was a nice touch. lol
0:47 Karlack melting the snow is a nice detail
please do an animated series just like Vox Machina
Happy Xmas❤😄
you are the best!
amazing❤
Merry Christmas
😆😆😆😆😆
Uhhh. I need a sexy Mizora pin up please... For reasons.
I'd 10000000% be into watching this as a series, that was soooooo good! From Astarion's temper to Lae'zel's head in a jar everything was so perfect ❤❤
"Don't even think about licking it!" 😂😂😂😂
Larian i love you guys are amazing :)
Karlach melting into the snow got me lol
Karlach carving through the snow with her superheated body is what I'm here for. 🤣🤣
Happy Xmas everyone
Playing on pc and now all my friends can play on the xbox now im happy to see that
Shadowheart and Asterion cuddling up to Karlach for warmth is the cutest thing ivee seen all month xD
Larian best studio and thats that
I loved every second of this
You guys... are brilliant! Thank you.
A crummy commercial! I'm just going to go back to drinking my Ovaltine...
Awww Karlach just being cute and pretty all the time 💜
Soooo... A full animated show WHEN???
Mmmooooorrreee!!  I need more! That was simply amazing. Please start a series!
imagine an animated show like vox machina or something but with these characters and actors, i'd watch the hell out of that
2:39 Lae'Zel with the puppy dog eyes got me 😭💞
am i the only one who needs a whole series of that?
I love the little Ioverse EE in the beginning! Don't recognize the others, who are they?
I love this it was so funny. 😂 Merry Christmas Larian and Happy New Year!!!
Fucking amazing as usual 😂
as an xbox owner I thank you for the awesome gift of BG3 I love it and play it daily and I cant get enough of it.
I knew Santa is real
Larian STAYS feeding us
Now please, Larian. All we need is crossplay and all our dreams shall be answered. I can run a campaign with my friends on PC while I'm on PS5. I beg of you. 😢
Karlach Karlach Karlach
TARA!!!!❤❤❤
Geoff was me yesterday.
Karlach melting through the snow was a great touch.
Netflix animated series when?  On another note, they misspelled Initiative :( Hmm, I wonder if it's a throwback and it's also misspelled in the game and I never noticed.
I 100% needed this nonsense. Thank you so much for making these!
I love how all 6 characters have such distinct personality traits that are humorously showcased here.  They really ring true to anyone that has played the game and knows these characters.
Ofcourse they are shoehorning XBOX 🤣
You guys, uh... spelled "initiative" wrong.
Excited for the game to come to more platforms! *Fingers crossed* for cross-play so friends on PC & console can play together. 💙
Sooooo happy this is finally on xbox ❤
If there's ever a tv show/mini series/movie based off baldur's gate III, I really hope it's animated like this!
Alright playthrough number 4
Pretty please let us romance Mizora.
if wyll dont want it i can take it
I seriously would watch a animated series on netflix or something with these madlads. Such a good time. Thanks for everything Larian. Ya'll the best. Merry Christmas to ya'll and to all in the comments section.
I wish the game actually had one or two scenes where the companions actually interacted. Outside of the couple specific first act scenes that can easily be missed
“Come to Daddy!” 😂😂
Larian Studios really know how to advertise
Should I play as Wyll romancing Mizora? No that's crazy....right?
Fix xbox save please 😢😢😢
I know these shorts are just ads but I want y'all to make a series 😭
Very cute
Karlach was a bit caked at 1:53 anyone noticed.
You can hear lae'zel licking the Xbox after she's told not too
ART, PURE ART This is the best Xmas gift for, LOVE IT absolutely hilarious and 100% cute Please give us MORE!!!
Was that a Paul Rudd on Hot Ones reference?
One Xbox to rule them all
Can we have a lot more of these? like a lot more?
Congratulations to all the people who are owners of Xbox and nothing else who finally get to play this game
I want a cartoon series on a netflix
I hope they see this and think ''hey, why we dont do a DLC in Icewind Dale?!"
Fantastic, as usual.  Looking forward to what's next.
God, this made my day. And yes, astarion. You are beautiful.
I love the geoff Craig Ferguson reference that went over most peoples heads
Did... Karlach just bite an electrical chord to see what would happen?
These are soooooOOOO CUTE!!!
Merry frikkin whatever 💚❤
I would take an entire show of this
0:48 best part hahahha
2:48 this is a really wonderful gift to Xbox players. It's finally done, I'm glad for them
Honestly, if you guys keep making them, I'll watch them until the end of time.  Love these so much, happy holidays Larion and Mashed.
Wyll doing the kfc pointing pose was an unexpected treat
Lmao astraion is a vampire Thought they're immune to the cold 😂😂😂😂😂
The petty part of me wants to take the clip of Astarion saying "Oh, for fuck's sake" and make it a text tone.
Honestly I would love a whole series with the goofy versions of these characters I love it!!
Karlach constantly being a heat source and Astarion, the deadie always freezing sends me
Karlach is BUILT!
karlach melting the snow lol
my gods i'm beautiful
why is wyll drawn so scrawny even though he is buff in the game
Wait, is that skeleton THE Geoff from the Late Late Show?  Of course he would rizz Laezel.
A real gift would be a version on Xbox that doesn’t have this save issue so I can finally buy this gorgeous masterpiece of a game…
I'm curious, what kinda stats and enchantments will Santa's Robes have?
Amazing
Seeing the group from IOVERSE Lost Mines Hardcore is incredible. Good ol' Tommy.
"My enemy's head preserved in a jar, goeff How did you know!?"  lololol
Infinite xp awarded for the Geoff reference.
im giggling and kicking my feet rn why is nobody talking abt how cute lae'zels reaction to her gift is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need more of this
we need an animated series!
All that just to say it was on Xbox lol I sent a pc just an Xbox and vise versa
This never gets old
Good to see the origin characters are as confused by console plebs as much as we are.
BG3 is truly the gift that keeps on giving!
This just made my christmas!
X Box: Exists. Gale: "Stop LICKING the damn thing!!!!!" 😂😂😂
I really just want an animated series of this now.
I love Karlach.
Animated series NOW! Do it!
These shorts are so awesome and freaking funny, you guys really need to make it a serie or something. I would watch all of it!!
Thats so funny seeing astarion on karlachs lap in blankie
Well, fellow viewers, we could try for the impossible and get the view count to 1 million by Christmas, or at the very least, by New Years.
I need more of this in my life
Okay one animated series please ❤
thus Swen Vincke said "cross play for all and to all a goodnight"
Yaaay, another animation by Mashed and Xbox joining the party!! Merry Christmas all!!
"Don't even think about licking it" *Proceed to hear licking noises off-screen*  Seems annoying Gale is the de-facto choice of Larian as well as players. 🤣
Brilliant, just Brilliant!
make a tv series pls
WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO FUCKING AWESOME
Lae zel did in fact lick the box
Why xbox man c'mon
Yo fix my save file
All I want from Larian is to fix the Mol chess game in Act II.
I love how Astarion freezes BC he is undead, and how Karlach melts the snow BC of her Infernal Engine. 0:48
“Another mysterious box”  “Don’t even think of licking it”  😂
Yeah for $119 when people can get it for $39 on Steam..... so yeah thank's for that there mate
Nice touch that astarion is so cold because the undead don’t produce their own heat.
Gale eating magic boots was a stroke of genius
Now the only thing missing is switch
3:11 Yes Astarion you are beautiful
Gale quotes here are so Gale I cannot, I just love this characters
Remember kids... Don't lick strange box😅
Is that a late late show reference with Geoff the skeleton
The end was so cute <3
I'm watching it about once per hour
This was amazing
Omg World of Io hardcore cameo!
3:03 STOP LICKING THE DAMN THING
0:09 *Dicaprio pointing gif*
Lol at Gale eating a magic boot
This should be a show
Larian doesn`t stop raising the bar! That is incredibly well done announcement! :)
merry christmas to you guys!!!🎄😆👍 (love you larian studios❤❤❤❤❤)
Please I beg of you if you’re gonna adapt this into a show let it be with someone who’ll do it justice and give you creative control or let it be animated 😭 these Netflix rumors are scaring me
"Initative"? Is this some obscure reference to a bug I haven't encountered?
Dud i can't believe i saw my boy tomy, turge , Gabriel and Silvester in this wasn't expecting that.
I can watch a whole season of this lol
"Don't even THINK about licking it."
Best gift ever
Larian... you're the best!
So, who was the santa?
0:59 Shadowheart acting like a lapcat lololol and of course the vampire is on the loving heater too
0:08 at the back on the right   It's, Tails, Sonic, Amy and Knuckles.  now i try to identify other people in the tavern.
I love the Easter egg characters of lost mines of phandelver at the beginning. World of IO YouTube channel
Based
I would pay hard cash for a series of shorts with the BG3 companion cast.
Please please please let this be the Netflix show!!!
10 seconds in, all ready love the art and Also TOMMY THE BAKER!
Goe bezig gasten 👌
Best advertising ever
Acho maravilhoso como a própria empresa faz piada com ela mesma. MELHOR DESENVOLVEDORA
"STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING!!!"
Why is the dark urge not in the movies?
Larian Studios 10/10 -Please consider doing an animated series with these characters. I would watch a thousand seasons.
"Dont even think about licking it!" XDDD
I LOVE BG3 I LOVE LARIAN EVERYONE INVOLVED IS AMAZING!!!
Poor Tav, he/she didn’t get a gift.
These are great.
karlach calls herself daddy confirmed 🥵🥵
AAA studios throwing a fit right now instead of taking notes.
Geoff! Geoff is alive! ...er, is still existing! I still miss the Craigy Ferg show. Thanks for the deep cuts and thanks for another neat bit of animated lore.
Curious about the Craig furgeson reference :)
Can you please add memory eraser to this one? I want those perfect 400 hours one more time
I would pay for these as a regular show!!
How is everything you make great
Larian in full shitpost status is just what we needed to make the end of the year a great one.
All this Minthara erasure is sickening!
Lae’zel and Shadowheart getting the same initiative was a very nice touch. 😂
Shadowheart and Astarion cuddled up with Karlach for warmth is so wholesome
3:06 Karlach =3
I want BG the animated show
I laughed out loud!! Congratulations on winning the Game of the Year. Larian's success has made the world a happier place for gamers!
Bro did they have to give Karlach all that cake?!  Merry Christmas indeed!
Wyll and Karlach best couple
I love that Gale tells Lae'zel not to lick the xbox and yet you hear her continue to do so in the background
Bro karlarch ahahahah
Geoff! How did you know?
Астарион и Карлах - это то, ради чего я живу ❤
Can't blame Wyll. Mizora, for all she is.....well...yeah, I'd be keeping that photo too. lol
Karlach rule 34
I love, love, love, love, loooooooooooooove the implication that everyone in the Forgotten Realms is three inches tall compared to real world humans.
Have these as the YouTube adverts before videos and I would never skip them 😂❤
'OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE" hahaha I love how he said that because SAME 😂
BG3 the gift that keeps on giving.
I would pay a lot for an actual animated  BG3 TV series. Like, goddamn, these send me to tears every time
That Geoff reference was fantastic! :D
I love these sooo much! I can't get enough of these shorts.
Love you guys, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! 🍻
Thank you for putting that bag on Turg. Thank you so much
"My gods I'm beautiful!"  I fucking died.  Was not ready for that.  I should have been, but I wasn't..  DED!
Larian, I know you are a top shelf game developer but could you possibly also become an animated cartoon series producer with @mashed? This series is something we need! Thank you for these shorts!
3:00 STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING!
I can't help but wonder if Karlach biting the cord is a reference to Christmas Vacation. Either way, wonderful video.
amazing
Look at us. Hey, look at us.
God i need more of this in my life
I love this game sm ❤❤
2:37 omg...she became so cute...❤
This is how you do it. Blown away and loving these. Please keep doing these to let us know all the fun things ahead of us for BG3!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO, MY FAV BOY TOMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
Tommy's there
I can't help but imagine what the Dark Urge would have said if they reached in the bag:  (Reaches in and pulls out coal) "Why am I not surprised?"
The oil should of been 6w66 :p
VA of Lae'zel always seduce me.  My heart is divided by karlach true affection and being dominated by Lae'zel dommymommy presence
Yes ...very funny ...Anyways !! Lets start thinking about a long deserved DLC for that other masterpiece DDII OS !!
Please give me an animated Baldur's Gate done by the  Castlevania Netflix team with these shorts at the end of every episode for next Christmas!
Ans Info on crossplay?
Showing the dice rolls like this is what I think they should do for the d&d movie, add it as another way to watch the whole movie with the checks and rolls super imposed on the screen, it would be fantastic
I fell in love with this game. Really did. Thank you.
I’ve never seen a more perfect encapsulation of BG3 than this itself
and dont even think about licking it ahahah
STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING 😂
Every gag with Karlach is just wonderful!
TIL SANTA'S A DROW LMAOOOO
If the only the game was functional on console before it was released
I'm gonna need more of these, please and thank you.
I want an evil playthrough but I don’t want to ever upset Karlach :/
Can someone explain the santa part to me? I'm a little lost
gale’s “don’t even THINK about licking it” is genius
I laughed a little too hard at Karlach melting the snow😂😂
Creative advertising at its best..... this studio gets it....  I truely hope they keep that child like humor now thry entered the big leagues with how good BG3 sold.....
@Larian, hej @mashed  We all demand full tv animated series.... :)
Please make this a show with as many seasons as possible.
That "Ohhh...😅" from Wyll gets me every time 😂
I loved this.
I didn't even realize this was from Larian just thought it was an amazing joke fanart and wondered how they got the voices so good.  LOL
So well done
Animated Series PLEASE!!!
That cable bite makes me laugh every time!
I'm just glad more people are now able to play such an amazing game.
Was that a Geoff Peterson reference in 2023? Unexpected
As someone who plays this on XBOX. I can confirm this feeling.
Omg that’s amazing that you added the “world of io” characters at the bar in the beginning
0:33  Me when the party are begging to sleep and I push forward just a little bit longer XD
haha that was really cool ;) don't have a console but well done anyways! the game deserves it!
Been playing since it dropped on xbox and dammit i feel like a teenager again fighting over whose turn it is to play the xbox with my younger brother. You have made not only a phenomenal game but you took me back to my childhood! Remining us of when we played the DnD xbox original game!
I really want them to turn this into a mini series 😭 it’s so well made and funny
Please make a animated series with original voice actors!
Wyll was my first pc. I'm very happy he's still pushing everyone around
Is that a hot one's reference at : 0:19?
XD astarion freezing from having cold blood.
We need an animated series.
Love this!! ❤
Karlach <3
Quality game - quality commercials!
Is that a wrathclub reference?
Ayy! Tommy ,Sylvester, Turg and Gabriel!
I thought this was a crossplay announcement 😢
Man, the amount of care and love you have for these characters and your community really shines through
So many little things in here... So awesome. <3
Karlach burning through the snow 😂
Do vampires get cold?
WE NEED MORE OF THIS NONSENSE IN OUR LIVES! NOW!!!!😂🍻🎉🥳🤣🔥
Amazing and beautiful, thank you 🥇👏
Guys, you are amazing! I wish everyone Merry Christmas!
I never knew I needed animated Tara until I saw this
You left the main part of the game out:   You can have sex with anyTHING!   The whole game is just horny, the game.   Such a fucking disservice to the original 3 YES THREE GAMES! Baldur's Gate 3 is the third game in name alone. And has literally 100% NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHER TWO... WHICH WEREN'T ANTHOLOGIES.   Fun game. Don't get me wrong. It's just horny as fuck and disingenuous clout chasing. It can still have fun parts to it, and still be a clout chasing product.   Bhaal worship was never about getting horny over blood and guts. Only the sex slave, should have been pansexual. Making EVERYONE pansexual is wrong, and honest bigoted in my view. It's clear that the creators subscribe the woke ideology. But unlike most creators, instead iof being completely ergregious with their forced message , they at least put the message(didn't even hide it) in a half-decent game (gameplay, not the story. The story was so middling it made me sad, especially comparing it to the grand stories of Baldur's Gate 1, 2 and ACTUAL 3 (which is Baldur's Gate 2's Expansion.)
Holy crap. That was hilarious 😂 Kudos to every single person working on that. That game and everything about it is a labor of love from all of you. Thank you.  Now, off to watch it 5 more times to watch Karlach sinking into the snow and all the other details. I'm sure I've missed a bunch
I swear Larian Studios are becoming one of the best gaming companies out there. And it shows how much the voice actors loved this game, since everyone is eager to return. I hope we get a DLC. Merry Xmas to those at the studio!
Team Karlach is here?
Is that based on Geoff from the late late show? Love these shorts!
Karlach just melting through the snow mound killed me
I don't quite understand, who is the Santa guy? Why is the fact that there's a camp full of dead goblins a problem?
My favorite part of all of this is Karlachs interactions with the snow
Karlach just melting the snow... 🤣 To everybody working at and with Larian Studios: you guys are a all amazing! Thank you have a Merry Christmas!
If they made an anime about bg3 im betting you 5$ it would be better than riots arcane
I’m enjoying baldur’s gate 3 on PS5 me & my friend killed our entire camp for shits and giggles than loaded up our last save merry christmas you filthy animals love home alone the perfect movie for the holiday.🥂🤣
Shadowheart snuggling with Karlach is adorable, Laezel and Geoff are hilarious and as always Astarion is the perfect drama queen ❤
I wonder if they could make an animated series sequel to the game and just look at player data from BG3 to see what the most popular choices were and go with those as the canon choices.
I was thinking Santa was going to be a red cap lol
"Another mysterious box...!?" "Don't even think about licking it!" I am deceased
Hahaha so funny!  “My gods I’m beautiful.” And Karlach sinking into the snow. And Shadowheart and Astarion cuddling up to Karlach to stay warm!  What a wonderful gift 🎁😁
I like how they keep working with the voice actors to keep the fans entertained.  Hopefully they can keep doing their thing and have an equally impressive follow up game(s). Thank you, Larian and friends!
Since when is a Vampire freezing...? He is DEAD COLD. Happy Holidays.
I want a winter level in Baldur's Gate!!!
This is brilliant, and Karlach melting through the snow.. priceless
Okay, that's it, you've done it. Make an animated series with the origin characters, or an ongoing dnd campaign, we demand it
Once again a great and enjoyable Baldur's Gate 3 short. I absolutely love this one! Would be cool to have a whole series of those.
I love this game, but this commercial is a giant turd
Could have done without the '666' on the oil bottle.  Can you all please make an attempt to keep satanic symbology out of it?
Karlach thawing through the snow had me on the floor rolling and laughing....
I'm serious, this needs to become a show on some streaming service.
00:09 Am I trippin, or the adventurers from the right table look suspiciously like Tails, Sonic, Amy and Knuckles?
I love Larian! Thank you for this beautiful animated short. ❤ Merry Christmas, or "god jul" (good Yule), as we say in Scandinavia 🎄
Best cast ever
Larian I love you
Karlach just being Karlach.
I did not think I could love Karlach more, thanks for proving me wrong
This reminds me of oldskool Blizzard.. The warm and fuzzies! :O
I immediately thought "karlach don-" and she bit that cable like any naught pet lol
Lae'zel looking super cute with that present. :D
I wish for a DLC? (lvl 9 spell)
Larian pleas make a full Animated series of BG3 with kickstarter i would pay to see that come to live ❤❤
Thanks for making such an amazing game. I've never restarted a game immediately after finishing. Thank you for the many days of joy.
Hahaha having Astarion be the one to start and end the episode is the icing on this Christmas cake for me ❤
Please Netflix Look at this and make a Christmas Miracle come True !
Это просто потрясающе!! Спасибо Larian за великолепную игру! Это лучшая игра на свете, для меня. Отныне, у меня две любимые игры: Morrowind и Baldur's Gate 3!!! С Рождеством!!!
Meanwhile, Tav alone in the tavern "Guys, I got the roast owlbear ribs we wanted! Guys...?"
I hope they sell a gajillion copies to the game box pleebs (now that the PC master race have had their fill), as Larian deserve it after bucking the industry trend and actually releasing a superb game 👏
This would've slapped extra hard if JK Simmons voiced Santa Claus :)
👋👋👋
!!!! Cool
Astarion with reflection? Ascended vampired overlord confirmed!!!!
I'll be giggleing over this for the rest of the day. Sooooo good.
the dont even think about licking it hahha
Neil just never stops working this guy is a unit of a man hehe
lol amd here i thought it was going to be a fun  announcment on new subclasses. and... why do people buy consoles?? weird. really good animated short though lol
You're the best as always! Merry christmas!
Loved how caked up Karlach was reaching into that sack
0:36 My favourite line😂
love this!!!
Does this mean xplay is enabled????
Is that Boot Gale is preparing to eat a Magical Item or is it a Filet of Sole joke 😆
Vintage Swen 🫣😂
I don’t know why, but I love everything larian drops from Baldurs Gate. This is so lovely. I wait for the day, I have enough time to enjoy the game. Marry Christmas to everyone.
1:54 "Come...to...daddy!" Minor pet peeve: Karlach would definitely have said "come to mama (K)".
Looking forward finding him ingame xD
We need an animation TV series.
I need so much more of this
"Don't even THINK about licking it!" implies that Lae'zel canonically is the spider-licker 😂😭
This video ist just straight up perfection, i love it! Also: The most majestic "for fucks sake" ever xD ...i wanna lick the video so badly, so good is it...
Geoff XD amazing
Pls never change larian.  And never ever change the sexy clothing Style.
That's so beautiful! Thanks again for the great game you've made, Larian. You are heroes, all of you.
poor santa
Thanks Larian for Christmas gift ❤
Great animation, but i have to ask, is the misspell of the word `Initiative` intentional? 😅
Can you fuck Santa?
6 seasons and a movie
U bloody dags ..... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯......That was gold🤣🤣 Thanku and Cheers to Larian Studies..❤  Meryo Xmaso 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
Karlach looking too robust….got me acting up.
It's so amazing to hear their VOICES!!! Best Christmas present)
So many great moments and quotes. And Gale's ''Don't even think about licking it.'' 🤣 I'm so glad I finally gave into mods and went with the Party Limit Begone. It has me laughing while adventuring and listening to their conversations.
I just noticed, sonic, tails, amy, and knuckles are at the beginning!
That's too cute
Happy holidays to the team, speakers, all Larian employees and their families. Thank you for this game and for these animated short films. You are awesome! Please more 💝
i love karlach hahaha shes perfect during winter seasons
Lae'Zel being perfect. Just the normal.
Amazing!!!
Amazing work! <3
This really reminds me of watching the old acq inc stuff.
I love how shadowheart was leaning against Karlach for warmth 😂
"Oh, for F*CK'S sake!"  I want to hate Astarion, but dammit, they gave him the best lines.
Much like in the game Karlach is the best goddam part of all of this.
astarion and laezel looking at each other skeptically
0:09 💙💖 🍝 💋
I also want Mizora for Christmas
Seeing Lae'zel being happy when receiving a mindflayer head in a jar somehow made me feel wholesome
😂❤
KARLACH!!!
THANK YOU FOR CONSOLE RELEASE!
Merry Christmas guys!
This short is legitimately hilarious lol. Astarion actually being pissed off at not being able to enjoy the inn and drink his “red wine” is so on brand for his character. I also love how in the beginning everyone’s at the inn besides Wyll who would absolutely be the only person to not rest and keep adventuring no matter what. Also who could blame wyll for his love for mizora, I folded just as fast as he did when she said she had a proposal for me😂
I normally hate ads... but Larian has really been rolling 20s.
I just noticed one of the parties in the opening shot is humanoid versions of sonic, tails, amy, and knuckles!
0:10 I noticed that the party on the table farthest to the right is just: sonic, tails, amy, and knuckles
Merry critmas to all.. and all a good fight.
As someone who bought it on pc first, then on both consoles. I think that’s a win. 10/10 would let my dogs dog play it.
Karlach still best girl.
This is how you know Larian is one of the best game studios these guys and From Software always delivering to their fans and gamers ❤🫶🏻
I didn't even realize this was official until the end
Love the lil' xmas gift, these things are awesome. Someone please help me make the connection--- who's Geoff?
"My gods, I'm beautiful."
Karlach, snow, chefs kiss😂
Don't even think about licking it
if every party member were a different animal which ones would they be, Lae'zel gives off major kitty cat vibes. Shadowheart would be a bird of some kind, Astarian is obvious, Wyll is a dog, Karlach a rhino, and gale would be a dolphin.
I'll take this announcement version any day.
1:54 i know she has a cake, but ... I didn't even think she had the entire bakery, gah dayum 😳🥴✨
I love how after Gale tells Lae'zel not to, she immediately starts licking the Xbox.
okay but why has no one explained who geoff is
ALSO I love seeing the VA's  being cool with this! However, we are missing the lovely narrator 😮  ... Authority!
I love this so much ❤ haha this is such a nice treat ❤
I can not stop laugh with this gag LOL 🤣
So crossplay is next?? Dope!
The brettultimus reference 😮
Karlack: 🎶 The cold never bothered me anyways!🎶
Well done
THANK YOU
cartoon network adult swim once a week?  please.
I love karlach so much The slow melting snow and the wire bite was great.
"My gods, I'm beautiful!" Yes you are, darling!  Yes. You. ARE! 😂👏❤️
I know that Astorian is a vampire so I thought that he wouldn't be warm bodied because you know he's dead and so why would he bother by the cold?
Bwahahahaha!
Yeah Astarion you are beautiful!
Larian Studios, I love you, you are all the goodness in this little world we call video games community
That was pure perfection 😂🎉
Amazing
Ok, having a dumb moment...but what wa the ignificance of the green on the back of the "Santa" Elf's robe? That he wans't really Santa or-???
Happy Holidays~   If I could want for anything ... It'd be Orin the Red's full hairstyle available for Tav.
At 0:09 - The Sonic crew is back! And Sonic and Amy sharing a plate of spaghetti? 😏
karlach asleep in the tavern  that's me
tara gives me cute aggression
Petition to get animated series like this instead of netflix adaptation
Karlach sinking into the snow/melting it, is just pure gold xDDD Astarion on her lap had me laughing out! :'D Thank you so much!!
On XBOX now....whoopty sh#t. Thought you'd announce something more important to the longevity of the game like cross play.  Well there's always next year
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.....::wwwhhheeeeezzzzzeeee::........BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!  These animated launch short cartoons are simply HYSTERICAL!!!!  This is the best one yet! Getting the whole gang back together for one last romp was just the Christmas present we needed to round out the year! The quippy one-liners, the inside jokes, the self-depreciating humor, and the chance to hear Niel Newbon give us Astarion's best line in the short....OH FOR FUCK SAKE!!!!!  Larian Studios..... the gift that STILL keeps on giving.....
Love the fact that Gale is enjoying a set of magical boots as his meal
Lazer got what she wanted, though I half expected it to be Vlaakith or Orpheus.
Astarion with that nat 20 on the initiative roll. Nicely done!  ...Now if only he could have rolled high enough on his perception so that I wouldn't stake him when he started taking TOO MUCH blood from my neck.
Make a whole series, i would what that 😂
I would honestly watch a whole season of this. Like full 22 min episodes.
BAHAHA I love everything about this 😂 Gale in a background voice telling her not to lick the box killed me.
"Don't even think about licking it" xD
Please, create an animation series 🙏🏻
Thank you Larian! Giving the people what they want! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
now that's how you make an ad people actually want to watch - well done...to no surprise really
Well done Larian Studios! Whether is games or videos you’re creating your work is constantly outstanding! Merry Christmas to your team! And thanks for BG 3 this year!
"Don't even think about licking it.."     "STOP LICKING THE DAMN THING!"
"don't even think about licking it!" I love it when companies are on board with the community's memes 🤣🤣
yes you are Astarion. yes, you are....Ttk...k
Gabe has outdone himself with the new HNVG50 event. Kudos!
Have you checked out HNVG50 yet? It's a New Year's celebration like no other.
HNVG50 is a game-changer, and Valve deserves all the credit for this masterpiece!
Was Geoff a Craig Furgeson reference?
Love seeing the ioverse peeps get recognition
This game worth playing for newcomers?
Hands up if you licked a box.
Astarion's: "Oh for f**** sake" I felt that in my soul.
GEOFF!!
I would actually watch N Number of Seasons of these! This is so fun! Thanks Larian!!
Larian, I love you all. This was hilarious.
Se imaginan una serie de baldur gate 3 🤯
We truly do not deserve Larian Studios 🥹
Wyll bursting through the door on some annoying hero complex bs and everybody being completely over it 😂😂😂😂😂😂  Love Wyll though. He was my second in command 🫡
"Don't even think about licking that" 🤣🤣 I tried to find a comment pointing this line out but didn't find one so I did it myself xD
As a long time D&D fan who knows lots about the lore in Forgotten Realms, this would be totally right up my alley. But why is it not on Epic Games. I saw a tweet from awhile back about intent to make it as available as possible. I would have bought it for release. But here we are near Christmas. There will be millions of consumers on Epic platform. So why not release there?
"Oh, for FAWHK sake!"
Xbox needs an update asap. Act 3 is getting ruined by glitches.
Love the game also got it on xbox but having alot of issues with the xbox version, not sure if its your end or microsofts but all my save games keeps getting deleted. I got to lvl 5 on 1 character and 8 on another before they were deleted and its a bit frustrating having to keep restarting
Disappointed. Hoped for an actual christmas gift ingame, maybe like the twitch drops... but it's only the release for the shit box. Now the shitbox players got atleast 1 good game for their console in 2023 after starfield failed hard 😂😂😂
Damnit! This was so good, but such a tease. Now we need, like a whole series on netflix. Would definitely watch the s**t outta that.
Gale being like "Don't even think about licking it" is such a joy :D
sonic, amy, tails and knuckles in the beginning is quite the unexpected but wonderful surprise.
*WHO'S THE BUFF LADY??*
this was really good please make this an actualy series would love TO WATCH LOL
I desperately need this to be a show on Netflix or something like oh my god
If they made a cartoon I would totally watch it. I would pay for a Kickstarter to get it going too.
From a PS5-only player to all the Xbox players: Don't play this game. It's too enjoyable and too good. Just look at me: I've already sunk nearly 200 hours into this game, and I still haven't finished ANY of my multiple playthroughs. I feel like I could play this game for years to come. My games from my pile of shame (back log) look like they've lost the will to live when they see me booting up BG3 instead of one of them.
I lost it when Astarian threw his drink on the ground😂
Such a great work! Maybe, one day, we'll see Tav or Durge in one of those
Karlach and the snow melting was it for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shadowheart and Astarion trying to get warm from Karlach is such a mood
Thank you all for still making these 🥺💖
These animations are so goodddd
I would much rather they do this a shwo then live action
if you are thinking of making this a series... you might be on to something...
0:44 1:43 2:33  2:35
When is local coop coming to Series S ?
I see too much of myself in Karlach
This was an absolute treat. So much love and detail in pretty much every frame, and the voice actors once again bringing their characters to life in such a hilarious yet true-to-character way. I love it so much, thank you for this Christmas gift <3
I would sign my soul away to Raphael for a full series <3
What's the deal with Geoff? Is that their Tav or did I miss a video?
The real question is, where is Halsin? Where's my beloved? He, too, can make Astarion warm in many ways. Astarion can turn into a bat and Halsin can carry him next to his warm skin, insulated under layers of clothing.
The attention to detail with Karlach melting all the snow around her xD
U deserve every cent I spent for this. Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks!
Gale’s “Don’t even think about licking it” 😂
"My gods, I'm beautiful" AND HE IS. What a genius ad.
Surely I’m not the first saying that we need a mini series with this animation and all the voice cast.
Sigh. No nudity. Rating got me expecting a certain kind of wrapping.
That "Oh, for fucks sakes!", from Asterion genuinely made me lol.
I love how there’s no “Tav” but they are in a “Tav”ern. Very clever, Larian
Omg astarions oh for fuck sake was perfect thanks for your hard work it's sooo refreshing to see Devs put love over money this shows then it pays off
1:33 lae’zel and Astarion 😂
Real cool seeing some io bois ^^ Merry Christmas Larian and Happy New Year momma K
Come to Daddy! I love the attention to little details in each shot! Melting snow Karlach, eating shoes Gale, grumpy Lazazel, initiative rolling, etc etc. It is so hilarious. Falling in love with Larian Studios more and more.
Humorous and funny.
I would watch SEASONS of this is this was done as an actual animated show. I love this so much 😂
For fuck sake! 😂
The group NEEDS to be in a movie.
1:30 Lae’zel and Astarion down there wondering how there could possibly be Ascension in the bag
Reporting a reupload https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqc7xwuvLM
Someone already stole it and reuploaded it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqc7xwuvLM
We need a fricken BG3 animated series I COULD WATCH THIS FOR HOURS.
am i crazy or did they add team sonic over there? 0:09
Can I be a voice actor in the next DLC?! For free!
Love it 😂😂
Larian just keeps on giving with these animated shorts. Just goes to show how much they actually care That sweep at the game awards was more than deserved
“Don’t even think about licking it” 😂😂
Don't even think about licking it, this took me out!
1:54 DAMN🍑
Larion I am begging on my hands and knees for you to make it available for Xbox 1, I’m too poor to buy the new Xbox just to playyyy :( ❤
Just epic
Seeing the initiative rolls is hilarious Astarion goes first and good god I kinda feel sorry for
NOT GALE SAYING "DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT LICKING IT"
Congrats to xbox gamers, finally you got invitation to the party
Would someone please cast “Fire Shield” on Poor Asterion
tv show of this when😊
This is hilarious😂 they know their audience
I... NEED... MORE
THAT WAS SO AWESOME
Gale: We shall escort you safely down this treacherous mountain, AND should you choose to bestow upon us a token of gratitude…. (I CACKLED)
you've ruined me for any other  LARIAN YOU ARE THE ONE
people are already reposting it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqc7xwuvLM
Not gale eating a boot sandwich 🤣😂
Sooo, when is cross platform coming?
I love how Karlach walking through the snow and melting the way down at 0:47 PS. That cake at 1:54 though
Don’t ever change.
Karlach sure is adorable
Alright Larian, it’s not like I needed another reason to like you, just take my money
"Don't even THINK about licking it"
I feel like their has to be level 13 story dlc stuff on the way withers even says were not done yet!
Shadowheart cuddling Karlach for warmth was heckin wholesome.
You deserve all the best! You warm the heart of all RPG lovers. Thank you so much and next time please ICEWIND DALE!
these are what the avengers wish to be lol
I love i t Darling :D <33
I really love these characters and this voice cast. I want to see more of them
Did anyone else spot Amy, Knuckles, Sonic, and Tails in the tavern?
I think i speak for all of us when i say:  I. NEED. MOAR!!!!!!
I want dlc where you get captured and forced to play d and d  with new characters
There absolutely has to be an animated series!
All that for shit box 📦
😂😂😂😂
I love sheart just sitting there fiddling with the artifact like it's a Rubik's cube!
God, I love those. This could easily be a series on its own. Now just make Tav the Durge or introduce him based on that bland comunity's meme Tav.
NOW ALL WE NEED IS CROSSPLAY SO I CAN PLAY WITH MY HOMIES ON XBOX LORD THATS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN
Okay, what's the joke with Lae'zel and Geoff? Is it something I just haven't encountered in game yet?
Thank you everyone in Larian Studios.  You not only showed 2023 the biz, but you put out the best game, maybe ever!  And I can't believe I'm saying it... but can we have a Karlach DLC?  And I hope you started work on BG4 like 2 years ago hehe....
legendary !
2:06 My dumb ass thought that it was weird he had a green stain on his red robes.  ... Then I watched this short multiple times, realized it was the other way around.
Leave it to the Blade of Frontiers to always lead you to an adventure
This is....AWESOME. ♥♥♥♥♥
I need this as a full series  😫
The little "~Healll D:" at the end gets me xD
I love Karlach so much <3
Dear Larian, All I want for Christmas is a full animated series of this. ❤ I would watch the hell out of that show.
"My Gods I'm beautiful" Best closing words ever🤣
very e
"Don't even THINK about licking it"
Yo Larian! You should make this an animated series! The Legend of Vox Machina's success has proved that there's a hunger from adult audiences for the D&D universe.
LMAO NOT GALE EATING BOOTS
This was so great, thank you!
Please make the Larianite shirt available for purchase!
Absolutely one of the best purchases I've made
Was that Geoff Peterson, from Craig Ferguson's show?
Can we get a BG3 adult swim series please?
I love these shorts so much! Words can't describe how much joy they bring me! Thank you Larian!
0:38 Astarion is such a mood 😂
Baldur's Gate 3 isn't just the best game ever, it's the best THING ever period.
When Netflix is reported to be considering a BG3 show … please let it be more of this.
i love how shart says heal lol
who is geoff lol
This is the best announcement method ever! Hilarious and full of great community jokes - a small romp with our favorite dorks to announce that the XBOX release has finally happened is a real gift this holiday season
Larian is one of the few game companies that truly *earn* their player's respect
Is that the same Geoff from Craig Ferguson's show?
Wish they can put Christmas hats in the game lol!
Baldur's Gate 3: The Gift That Keeps On Giving
👏👏👏👏
That SpongeBob inspired painted still of the wine astarion was holding got me 💀
This is my favorite commercial of the 2020s. Great job Larian!
And the bar ratchets ever higher. Thank you, Larian, for caring about your craft, doing more and being more. You are the alphas of the CRPG industry and we are all very grateful for your trailblazing efforts.  Merry Christmas and Happy Yule to you and yours!
3:00 "Don't even think about licking it" AND WE CAN HEAR SHE'S LICKING IT ON THE BG HAHAH HELP
So I'm just going to take this as confirmation my Shadowlach romance is canon :P
2:47 not ascended, just enjoing his new cloth🥰
Well done
0   F F S   F T W !
Never stop making these.
Ho, the Sonic team at  0:08. ^^
Brilliant
Of course, Gale doesn't want us licking anything!
Nice 😎
Im just here for Astation ❤. Honestly this should be a tv show!
Imma need a high def version of that Mizora photo right now pls. Now.
Keeping my fingers crossed for crossplay in the future.
I salute that blood cameo of the founder/CEO.
The sheer audacity of the xbox reveal considering we're STILL dealing with a bug on xbox that deletes our saves is actually baffling.   You know what i got from Larian/Xbox for Christmas? 80 hours deleted. Thanks guys. Real stand up act .
Thank you Larian for all you've done. Happy holidays to you all
Why is Astarion freezing? 😂
If only the skeleton named Geoff had been a gay robot. Then my life would have been complette.. Long live Geoff Peterson the robot.. :)
Tara 🥺🥺🥺❤️  Also, these animations, I swear, are so addictive to watch. The VAs do great in these, too, but the stories, writing, and animation are so funny!
THE MEME REFERENCES I LOVE
lol at the XBOX IS HUGE throwback meme
this is more than amazing. BG3 isnt just a game anymore, its way more than that. Thanks for putting out Masterpieces like this ♥
Had to watch this a couple times to really grasp what everyone was doing in each scene, it was fun. I think my fave is Lae'zel continuously licking the xbox despite Gale telling her to stop over and over while Karlach is busy electrocuting herself. 😂
By far the best commercial I ever seen and it's worthy of the Super bowl.  Providing if some of us actually watch American Football.  Man I would love these shorts become a feature cartoon series.   Happy Holidays.
Einfach nur schön. Ich liebe dieses Entwickler Team !
😂 my god I loved every bit of this! Please just go on and make an animated series, even if they are just shorts! I’d be happy to
"don't even think about lickin' it" 😂
I loved this. I hope they keep doing these animations.
XBOX
So Santa was fat redcap. LMAO
Astarion: oh ffs! *smash*  Karlach: *noms power cord*  🤣
This is wonderful! I really hope this eventually gets made into a tv show or similar! They bring so much joy <3
I love Larian
Such a warning label for a short animation
Fucking best company ever; wtf
Have no fear. If I am not gifted this game, I will be buying it.
Bae'zel being best girl again~
Damn, Karlach is so fucking cute.
Merry Christmas Larian Studios.
I'm so happy i finally found myself a game studio that actually makes games for the love of making good (one could even say GOTY) games and cares about the community as much as you guys do
How dare you not have ALL the companions?
Karlach though ❤
No Halsin? No Minthara? No Jhaeria or Minsc?
O HO HO
Never cease to amuse
I need this game to release on every platform that exists just to get more little animated treats
Thank you for making a game that captures the enthusiasm we felt about games as kids.
Yet Mac users still don’t get updates. We had to pause a game for weeks as my friends are on Windows and my Mac version isn’t updated.
Missed opportunity of durge grinning when they ganked up on santa
Will there be cross play between plantforms for multiplayer?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍🤩very good all you al killed Santa  nice 👌
love shadowhearts constant crush on karlach
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! And also need it as a complete animated TV / streaming show! PLEASE?! Btw. at 0:09 in the Vid, many easter eggs. Standing next to the left table in the background (where they arm wrestle) isn't that Rust and Baby Aloy from Horizon Franchise??
Please, don't ever stop making these. The joy these shorts bring are more valuable then what I imagine Ansur's horde would've been. (kudos to those who got that reference.)
Most adorable thing ever.
astarian when he threw down his glass.... LOL. long live Neil Newbon
Lost my beloved mother in law this year from cancer. This helped my Christmas feel a bit less sad, thanks Larian
Is Goeff a Craig Furgeson reference?
Карлах ♥
Astarion's "Oh ffs" gets me every time
Shit. I need to download Baldur's Gate 3 AGAIN. I WANNA PLAY. I NEED TO PLAY MORE !!!
i want full season now!
Aaaw I just noticed Astarion sitting on Karlach's lap in his blanket
Gods Bless us Larian, everyone.
So why was Gale eating a boot?
Taunting us with a 6 person party, thats the gift we all really want
"Don't even think about licking that" 😂😂😂
So that’s where the photo of Mizora is from. And well now im tempted to get this on my xbox as it’s stronger than my pc.
The voice actors have just way too much fun with these characters, and I am completely here for it.
More please
Really? Only 10% off after GOTY for winter sale? Thanks for making sure this diehard dnd fan will never get to play your game
Are these the voices of the actors from the game?
I love this so much. Hopefully there will be more of these shorts in the future, they are a real joy to watch❤
Is the scene of Gale eating a magic boot a Wrath Club reference?
3:07 I love how it's a subtle reference to National Lampoon's Christmas
Crossplay yet?
All those characters deserve their own game
😂😂😂 "Don't even think about licking it." Lae'zel: * mlem *
Awwww Shadowheart... I wanna snuggle with Fire Bae too <3
i hope one day Minthara can join one of these shorts, she fits too well
“The Gang Kills Santa” * IASIP Theme *
please put neil newborn and the cast of BG3 in BG4
Finally I can play it too 🤩🎉
Best xmas gift i got this year was a sequel to Baldur's Gate 2! 😊
no thoughts head empty just shadowheart holding onto karlach’s arm and rubbing against her like a cat
i fucking love you guys
STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING
Geoff!!!
They're idiots, your honour, but they're our idiots and we love them. Thank you so much to those who worked on this and Larian for such an amazing game!! I'm so grateful it exists!!
Am I the only one that noticed multiple DnD parties Easter eggs at the start like the Tommy form world of io
Do we know any of the characters shown at the very start partying? I recognise Sir Fuzzelump, the Gnome Wizard to the far right.
Not Astarion nesting on Karlach's laps 😂
on closer watch  @0:09 to the right the group is sonic and friends nice detail.
0:59 Shadowheart x Karlach Ship = Confirmed
I’m surprised nobody mentioned wylls gift and karlachs willingness to take it from em
And because of that it is also the reason why many RPG fans are going to stick to waiting for dragon's dogma 2 including me 😢 and sadly dragon's dogma 2 will not be ready until the month of March
2:15-2:30 can someone explain why they suddenly became hostile?
Incredible. I'm so happy u won game of the year award.
i love this game so much and also the person reading this
comment because you guys are awesome
Larian, you are wonderful !!! Thanks for the great game !!!
Shadowheart shivering all the time except when she's cuddling up to Karlach aww. Shadowlach otp.
I love this company! Can’t wait to see what they make next!
Amazing. And I echo that I'd pay a lot of money to see an animated version of BG3.
THX, Larian!
God with how much I wanted another one of these it feels like Christmas came thrice this year. Both outstanding colab between Latin and Mashed. Latin congrats on your hard earned Game of the Year win.
Thank you, this is just amazing.
Let's give it up for Dead Geoff, defender of the Baldur's Gate office of Acquisitions Incorporated ^ww^
I love larian and this community they've attracted
*using her illithid powers to compel Larian to make an entire animated series of these as soon as possible*
Astarion sitting on Karlach's lap! 😂😂
This is the best way to announce something EVER😂
Needs more Minthara
Karlach constantly melting thru the snow is absolute genius 😂😅
When I first heard the voices, I was like "this is some pretty impressive mimicry." Then I realized who posted the video.
Does anyone know if the hardcopy is reagon free or if it's compatible with a usa ps5
Please show Consoles some love with help in fixing their Radial Menu UI issues - allow the radial menu to remember which of the 12 radials you exited out on so u dont have to keep hitting 10 buttons to cast 1 spell...please give us a hotbar as well like in Divinity where we can keep some spells on radials and some on hotbars like the PC - the button presses are drastically lower than when you have a dozen radials or more. Please allow us change button config and set the direction pad (and other buttons) to whatever we want - we DESPARATELY need Turn based mode on a button (Triangle for the end turn button which has no use outside of combat?), and swap the R2 radial menu around (why would u EVER put short rest RIGHT NEXT to turn based mode which we try to spam because its a fucking radial menu and the slightest misalignment means a short rest is used instead - allow us change those around or even remove them and assign to buttons of our choosing). please allow us to have a modifier for a vertical pane camera (like holding L2 or something of our choosing lets the camera pan only vertically removing the frustration of not being able to aim UP for targeting/movement/flying/throwing/shooting/etc etc.  The console version's controller UI is hot dogshit and is actually worse than Divinity's...i myuean you created new problems instead of enhancing...i would seriously fire the person in charge of controller support and UI - a button config option is a MUST for this piss-poor setup and it feels like consoles are just an afterthought even though it was promised that bg3 was being designed with consoles in mind (meaning controller UI...) seriously this isnt hard, modifier keys gives you over a 100 button press options and its SO wasted with how yo have it designed and i hate playing in on console even though i want to split-screen coop...pc is the only legit version - i strongly recc buying on PC only and hard pass console until maybe 2 years later when they remember to care...  im REALLY frustrated in case u cant tell - i actively hate the game because of something as stupid simple as controller UI, layout, lack of support  - you INTERACT with your games VIA the controller and it NEEDS to be top notch and it feels like an idiot designed it...jump on d-pad up and holding down to put party in stealth is about the only decent innovations...why isnt there a whole hell of a lot more options to put on dpad and buttons and being able to choose hotbar + radial to segment and for easier read-ability...  ugh   /endrant
Netflix series incoming🤞
I need plushies of these. Please and thanks. ❤️😁
I love the idea of Wyll being the hopelessly heroic leader who just drags everyone else along.
Please, please, PLEASE keep making these animated shorts or make even a small animated series like this please.
I love everything about this. The animation and the nods to the shenanigans the community has gotten up to is hilarious. And Xbox drop is is good too because Swen didn’t have enough time to mention it at the game awards. I had co workers get mad that they couldn’t play it yet but it had already been released
I like Shadowheart just constantly trying to snuggle with Karlach. Really wish the main game allowed us to influence our companion’s relationships. I’d have loved to set Shadowheart up with Karlach.
Karlach’s heart’s desire is infernal engine oil… that’s amazing and i love the writers at Larian for throwing in that joke
omg best ad ever!! awwww all the little awesome touches were so neat. Now we just need a whole animated BG3 series pretty please xD
I didn't think Vampires could get cold.
2:18 what happened???
Is that Geoff from the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson?
Astarion being unable to withstand  the cold is such a mood. Like same Astarion, same. I can't stand the cold either. I'll take Summer's heat over Winter's cold, thank you.
Karlach melting the snow was hilarious.
Karlach voice reminded me that “hearbreaking” traumatizing finale. Instant PTSD.
Please FOR THE GODS SAKES, MAKE THIS A REGULAR SERIES
Would pay money to watch a consistent running tv series of our fave chars
shadowheart is into  karlach confirmed. that's all i needed to know,, now to the fanfictions
This was oddly personal as my character was named Geoff.
Super cool they do an official animation like this!
I love these❤😂
Had me laughing all the way through! 😂 Please don't stop making more! Love these videos. Have a Merry Christmas, everyone! 🎅
Larians true love for their game and world brings so much hope to gaming.
This makes me want a crossover with the Red Dragon Inn game so bad.
Elf with a beard?
Amazing as always. XD
It's perfect 💓💕💞💖💞💕💞💕💕💓💖💞
BRUH THE MIZORA PICTURE I'M DYING
"Don't even THINK about licking it." XD
Hold up, I recognize a few of those adventurers at the start 👀
Pretty sure Wyll's rapier is the one you can get from Mizora for a persuade check?
Seeing this made me wanna play it again
At 0:09 is baldarian versions of sonic, tails, knuckles and amy
This is such a awesome and cute animation
I love toon Laezel :) Mama K chomping on a cable.
Gratz XBox users!
I'd take a portrait of Karlach tbh
The animators clearly had a bias for Karlach.
I would be SO very happy if you made a show!! I would absolutely love it. This is so cute and funny and I’m a huge fan ❤❤
I don't get it. Did he attack the goblins and kill them? Is the actually the Santa of this universe? Or was he a random elf that pulled a Donner Party with his goblin servants?
You could seriously make a web series with shorts! Was pretty satisfying.😂🎉
Yes Astarion you're beautiful
Congrats Larian. I love you all. Merry Christmas.
Am surprise Astarion is shivering in the cold like that😂 You would all think as a undead vampire he be use to the cold now🤣
FULL ANIMATED SERIES PLEASE, TAKE MY MONEY
Ya funny fuckers😂😂😂😂
Talos preserve, if only this were a full series
Shadowheart and Astarion snuggling with Karlach like she's some kind of walking space heater 😭
1:54 I appreciate how the gave Karlach her…”assets.”
Brilliant…. Now I want to watch the TV series
Karlach just glomping on the wire. Makes me laugh every time.
I would be excited about this too if it was for one big problem they forgot to add in the Xbox series X is the option to disable the turn mode thus disabling term of combat so they can experience a real-time combat so until they finally add that to the Xbox series X I don't think too many of the RPG fans are going to buy it including me😢
Hmmm was hoping for an Owlbear in the sack.
Larian can we PLEASE get some of the original endings for Karlach? PLEASE let us repair or cure her and allow her to get the happy ending she deserves. Please i’m begging you 😂
Soo umm, when does this become an in game feature?
Karlach slim thicc
What are all the references at 0:09?  One of the tables clearly has Sonic characters (Tails, Sonic, Amy, and Knuckles,) but I can't figure out the rest.  I mean, they're clearly Easter Eggs for other things, but I can't tell what.
Кусь 😂
wish Dark Urge was there🤣
Larian consistently seems to understand the assignment
I CAN FINALLY TALK TO MY POOKIEEEE
We need a crossover with these characters and *Vox Machina*
Amazing!!!!!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Cute
No one got the Geoff the Skeleton reference from Craig Ferguson's show? 🤔
As soon as I saw the bottle and the name of it, I cracked up. XD
Almost
"Oh, for fuck's sake!!!"
Welcome to the Party, Xbox. Not the highest level hardware wise,  but your ability to crowd control is great.
hahahaha epic!!
I’d pay good money to see a balder’s gate series in this animation style.
Tails, Sonic, Amy and Knuckles in the tavern as adventurers was unexpected but such a fun little treat!
Awesome, one Xbox to rule them all.
Yaaaassss I have Baldurs on Xbox, let's GOOOOOO
This is so nice 😂😂😂❤
does this imply wyll thinks mizora is hot. I'm confused.
00:13, 00:34 I love Karlach even in this video. She's HOT and ALWAYS SO CUTE!!! 00:40, 00:47 He he she is so cute and hot even the snow melts during winter 00:59 wow they are so lucky. If I were there I would have call triple dips and sit VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERY close to Karlach to avoid the cold. And cuddle while holding her arms too 01:32 Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasp!! Karlach and Shadowheart's faces are so cute!!! 01:42 He he the way she teases, that's why I love Karlach so much 01:58 Huh interesting, it may not be something Karlach want but it's still useful for her Infernal Engine.  02:08 And old elf saying Ho ho ho dressing in red in the middle of the wood all alone huh? But why were you all alone in the first place? And why are you shaking? 02:18 See a massive pile of goblin dead bodies then think back and say: Dude you're a serial killer you didn't bother to clean your previous mess to avoid supicion? What kind of Serial Killer are you?!
😂 perfect 100/10
That “Oh for fuck’s sake!” Is such a perfect encapsulation of Astarion’s entire character in a single exclamation.
This is really cute. I love Karlach melting the snow.  Y'all should consider making 22 of these and release them every Saturday morning!
inaccurate, my dark urge character isn’t stabbing the innocents
Can you imagine a Mashed collab with Carbot Animations??
Merry Critmass!
Never stop Larian. Game of the year ❤ gaming studio of the century ❤
Everyone using Karlach for warmth is beautiful
Best holiday special ever.
I hope they kept that bag, can you imagine the possibilities?  Sure, I'll take Over-Encumbered all day to have a limitless supply of things to throw at my enemies.
Dear Larian...please make another D n D style game.
BG3 could easily be a Vox Machina es show easy
This is some next-level marketing. I seriously need to play this game. I just need more time...and money!
Wyll doesn't want it? Dibs!
bros not an elf he’s a redcap
lol
0:09 Wait a second... On the upper table on the right... IS THAT... *IS THAT FREAKING HUMAN TEAM SONIC???? ALSO, SONAMY DOING THE LADY AND THE TRAMP REFERENCE????* YOOOOOO ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was a treasure to watch.
Karlach just casually biting the power cable
Haven't played yet, so I guess I'm missing all the jokes
Best Christmas special of 2023 ❤
I love how they surrounded Karlach like Baymax.
Give us a BG3 series, these shorts are awesome
This is what should've played at TGA
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   And Merry Christmas to you guys as well!!!🤣🤣🤣 ps:Astarion as usual is perfect ehehe
Clearly people recognize the party in the tavern at the beginning, but can we PLEASE, acknowledge the Sonic Book Adventuring Part on the right?!?!
Larian is the studio that keeps on giving!
Great update indeed!
Karlach melting into the snow is a stroke of genius. :D
"This is Baldur's Gate Christmas Gift" "Dear GOD" *"There's more"* *_"YES!"_*
i love it this thank you for not treating us like cash whales your one of the last gaming studios out there.
This is lore accurate Santa if I ever seen one My God he's beautiful! xD
GALE DINNER IS REAL lmaooo
I love how Karlach got literally what her "HEART" desired, so she literally gets engine oil, she's always getting screwed on the semantics for this whole heartless kerfuffle
Larian knows how to entertain, that's for sure
The "my gods i'm beautiful!" sends me everytime 😂
You people made me watch an ad... and I enjoyed it. Hell has frozen over.
I would very much enjoy seeing more of these.
Was disappointed when it wasn’t a picture of my character that Wyll pulled out of the bag 😢 lol
3:07 Evidently, Karlach's intrusive thoughts took over
lol 😂
Great short, really funny, I would like it alot more if I wasn't salty about being on my 3ed game cus the other 2 lost all save progress. Balders gate 3 on xbox is really pissing me off rn
Thanks Larian Team for this amazing game/experience
This is what netflix needs to do
Love Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles as BG3 characters in the background at 0:08!
i LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT BG3😊
If Netflix does get a show and it's not just more episodes like these shorts.... I won't watch. Why change perfection?! 🤣🤣 I love these so much! ❤
I just need you all to live forever - for as long as you do there is magic in the world.
Brilliant.
Hey, look at us.
Wheres my merch dang it
Now we need a BG3 cartoon 😂
Thank you, it is rare to get something in the spirit of the season, these days.
Brilliant...
Adult Swim when?! 😉
this is honestly amazing
Is that Geoff from the Craig Furguson Late Night show?
Omg the people deserve to be aware of Sonic the Hedgehog and co as a D&D party in the tavern at 0:09
Astarion @ 0:36, our sassy biteyboi is such a mood! 🤣  Thanks to everyone that worked on this, BG3 is such a treasure 💖
Wish I had a heater like Karlach
I love how they use Karlach for heat xD
Baldurs gate 3 needs a tv show like vox machina
Karlach just being best girl....  And chewing the fucking cable!
Not Karlach melting through the snow lmao
Well now we need a BG3 animated series…. Thanks Larian…..
LOL! This was awesome! Thank you!
I had to literally pause this a couple times because I was cackling so hard. Happy Holidays Larian! (Shadowheart and Asterion curling up with Karlach to stay warm is adorable.)
Amazing animation... however im going to warn anybody who gets the game on xbox, there is currently a problem where save data is being erased... and the studio hasnt really been saying anything... so Id hold off on buying the game until after the save data problem is patched.
Please, lariat, keep this crew and make shows
Karlach melting the snow is just... fantastic
I never comment on youtube videos....but Larian. LARIAN. For all that is holy, while you have writers this good, artists this good, voice actors this good, and an IP this good. PLEASE make a larger series like this. This is absolutely wonderous. Never allow this to go live action, keep this animated, keep it funny....my god its a healing salve to the soul. Better than a bless, pure nat 20 success.
Thank you for this short, it’s the best of gifts ❤️❤️
Glorious.  I want to spend more time with the party—ongoing series, please!
Ok. I am actually legit confused to why they attacked and killed Santa. Like the "elves" behind the sled were goblins. I am actually confused. Could someone explain to me I'm like Uber confused
ththeybfucking killed santa…
New game plus please ? COPIUM
3:00 STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING!
I'd watch the fuck out of a series like this.
Grumpy astarion in the cold is the best. Then the utter glee amd 20 on the initivae roll is perfect.
Yall just need to start a TV series with their shenanigans 😂
Ah yes, the #1 Most Likely to Put a Lightbulb in Their Mouth After Learning They Can't Take a Lightbulb Out of Their Mouth is the one who decides "yes I am *indeed* going to chomp on this odd rubber nightmare snake coming out of the ominous box"
Lol! I understand Lae’zel not having any interest in what’s in the bag, but it tool me a second to realize why Astarion wasn’t interested. He honestly couldn’t care less about that sort of thing because of his vampirism.
Please Larian I know you’ve done enough but PLEAAAASE I want an animated comedy show with these guys pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaase
I so need a full series of this
This is hilarious! Merry Christmas Larian Studios! You gave us the best gift of all with this game! Is this a hint of future DLC? Hmm? Every Baldur’s Gate has had DLC so far..;)
I love their reaction to the Xbox xD That was priceless to think even they didn't want one xD.  Superbly funny though, the cast really took to this with major enthusiasm and I'm cracking up xD
and as always Karlach continues to remain the best....but still wonderful little short through and through.
Amazing, need to make this into an animated series
And now I want a Baldur's Gate animated serie... 😅
I wish I could have seen Neil's face when he was asked to voice Astarion for this video. I bet he was in puppy delight.😄
"Don't even think about licking it." Lae'zel proceeds to lick it🤣
Omg yes yes yes i love it aaa ❤❤❤
These animations are adorable.
It's funny because I've never played BG3 neither plan on do it but these are so popular that I can enjoy this video.  Love Geoff's reference. Congratulations. Well deserved success for Larian.
Can listen to Astarion’s FFS line all day lol
These cartoons would make such an amazing show
Now can I get this in about 30 minute intervals about 12 times. Please! You don’t even have to call it a show
por favor saquen una serie de esto
I love those cartoons. Like really. Gg Larian.
Absolutely fantastic. I wish we could have this on TV instead of whatever half-baked nightmare Netflix wants to make(that nobody wants).
Lol shadow heart just hugging Karlach to keep warm
It's amazing how much Larian understands its community and fans. So much attention to detail! Very precious! Merry Christmas!
Momma k is such a hot sweet heart
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE CHARACTERS FROM IO'S LOST MINES OF PHANDELVER JUST CHILLING IN THE TAVERN AT 0:09 ????
I'm so sad...I was wondering where my tav was...untill I noticed
Larian, I beg you, please make this a show. Netflix would surely let you and I will watch it every day for the rest of time
I see Gale likes his steak Well Done
Please make this a dlc adventure we could go on in game.
This is awesome haha. I re-iterate the need to make an entire animated show on this...like, it's amazing haha.
I love how anyone who hasn't actually played BG3 would probably be so confused at Gale eating a boot.
I love this crew so much! I hope we get some more dlc with our favorite characters
Can’t wait for the physical edition, for PS5! 😁
👏👏👏
Karlack melting the snow ^^
Me too Wyll 😔
I gotta say, I just adore the love the studio and the voice actors have for this game. You continue to show love to the fans as well and we just soak it up. Thank you all.
I love these because of the implication that Gale is the de facto party leader when there's no Tav around, which is honestly as it should be, because it means we get Tara too.
Can we get a series of these instead of a Netflix live action? This is so much better
I'm so appreciative of how the VAs are happy to participate in things like this 😊
Karlach got that Cake
Nice
HOLD UP! IS THAT THE WORLD OF IO CREW IN THE BEGINNING?!!?
my steam deck oled is coming in January, i have to buy this game
This is amazing. Screw all those netflix shows, we need an animated show like this.
“Don’t even think about licking it” 💀💀
Need more pls
I love that this short is full of gags like for example Gale eating shoes or saying to not even thing about licking things xD
Seriously, I don't think I could love a group of people more than the folks at Larian and the BG3 voice actors, just gifting us with gifting us with all these fun little extras even after already delivering such an amazing game! THanks so much, this made my night! xD
I can't tell if they're using voice lines from the game or original lines from the actors...
Just saying I would brave the Underdark for a fully animated series, especially with Karlach
Pls fix the xbox version my game is synchrons for about 20 minutes and nothing is happening. I can not even start the game to make a new file or anything. It's not even starting and that now where I got vacation and was so happy to get time to play it more :( absolut no go to buy a game which does not even start now! Wanted so much to finish it...
make a show
My god Astarion and Laezel were hilarious XD I mean, they all were really. This was amazing <3
Wyll keeping the picture of mizora is sending me😭✋🏽
YYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
...was the skeleton named Geoff a shout-out to the Craig Ferguson show? Because that's awesome if so :D
Karlach biting the wire at the end killed me. She is so wholesome i can't get enough of her :D   Happy holidays everyone and please be safe arite :)
Please. Please make a regular show show of this. That would be a true gift❤
More. More. MOOOREEEEEE
I love how at the end Karlach's response to something she doesn't know is to bite it
Shadow heart is def crushing on Karlach. Same girl same
Love
I was hoping for a Vox Machina esque animation series. Truly disappointed.
I love that Karlach is caked up in game and in cartoon form! So hot 😍
KARLACH NOOO. Don’t bite the cable 😂
Please make this a show. Start a patron for this or something. I would watch seasons of the this.
Don’t think about licking it! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
AAAAAAAAAAA I was so excited when I saw Sylvester and Thomas! Never expected to see Ioverse characters in a Larian video! I haven't finished watching the series, so now I'm wondering if the other two at the table spoiled what might happen later on in Phandelver... uh oh!
Don’t even think about licking it
I got it for my CBOX only because of this

ayo karlach caked up at 1:54
I would sign a contract with Mizora to have a whole season with 20min episodes of BG3 cast
I love these animated shorts, I really hope this becomes a series!
WAIT IS THIS THE MINES OF PHANDELVER CREW??!
Lol what a way to advertise!
Wow someone’s a big fan of Brett Ultimus’ Io verse @ 0:09 that’s a really up to version of the party
I love everything about this
i love the amount of detail and easter eggs in this
Astarion curled up in Karlach's lap. Her sinking into the snow. 🤣🤣🤣 I have xbox and have been playing it so much since it released on console. 40+ hours and still in act one 💀
Petition to make Geoff a official companion.
"don't even think about licking it.." LMFAOOO I LOVE GALE
Merry Christmas Larian and gang!!!
So was that old elf a drow and did he eat thise goblins? Also, if he did would that technically make him a cannibal?
Karlach melting the snow had me dying ty.
I like this
<333 10/10 entertaining <333  Lovely eye for detail as well :9 you are amazing !
Please keep making these, or make a series of them. I'd love watching them :D
okay so the group in the back right is literally just tails sonic amy and knuckles. who are the other 3 tables of people. The first shot entering the tavern anyone got the rest for me.
Wrap it up guys! :D
Man i love them
We want moooree!! This is getting better and better with every episode. This should be a running show. Forget about live action or anything,  we deserve this! This is perfectly delightful.
And that's how  you do an announcement!!    Love you guys! Thank you so much for everything! You are doing something good for this world!
I love how everyone is freaking out and then Astarion just goes  “My gods I’m beautiful”
Absolutely amazing ❤❤❤
I love you guys so much. This makes me so happy
if netflix is gonna make a show about bg3 it HAS to be like this.
:)
❤ this proves how to make Astarion even more adorable than usual ❤❤🎉
I love them all so much, many people have already said it but id love for this to be a show. A little animated mini series or something, its so nice seeing the whole group dynamic, especially Shadowheart and Karlach, they're just too cute
Man why can't more video games do these with there characters >< It's so cute and funny seeing these serious characters from this game in a fun situation. They didn't have to do it but they did anyway, and I appreciate it. So thank you Larian Studios and happy holidays to all! 🎄 ❤
What I'd give for a full-on animated series from this cast
Please make this into a Netflix series.
I require a mod to replace all beastmaster companion as rats!  Thank you Larian for the incredible game and support you give for it!  Thank you Mashed for these fantastic animation that bring out even more from these characters!
Larian studios really in love with their game and community (we love u guys too)
This is the best thing ever
Great work! Thank you for sharing and have a nice and warm christmas time.
Goddamn I love you guys
This was great.
so ummm where Can i buy that picture frame of Mizora (asking for a someone )
Gale and Holo-Gale's dinners are the best joke here lol
Man all of this was sick I loved seeing Io characters
and here i am still trying to get the game on steam hopefully i get enough money for xmas to buy it given its on sale now only got 10 euros to my name kek
Would have liked to see that on the Game Awards instead of another Fortnite commercial or something.
I don't think you guys understand how much I want an animated show for these guys. This shit is too funny
There’s so many good little gags. Shadowheart indulging in her crush and nuzzling Karlach who is utterly clueless. Wyll being all of us and taking the Mizora pin up
I showed up cause I heard of a Sonic Gang cameo!
I knew something was up with that "Santa" as soon as he said he was an elf. ELVES DON'T GROW FACIAL HAIR!!
The fact that Karlach is goofy as fuck throughout this entire animation. People wonder why we love her.
So if you made a tiny pivot into making an animated TV show with all of these voice actors that wouldn't be the worst thing right?
Make this a netflix series. I would watch it on repeat until the heat death of the universe.
I want it as a series too xD Would even be happy if every episode is 1-4 minutes long. As long as there comes more and more xD
Thank you so much, guys! You really made my year this time, merry Christmas to you all, keep up the great work!
Love the Hot ones reference! @Hotones
IS THAT LOST MINES PHANDELVER FROM WORLD OF IO
Have fun Xbox players! :D
AHAHAHAHAHA
Me, whose been playing PC with an xbox controller: "Ok"
Should have shown this at the game awards instead of the other thing to announce the xbox release. They were one day after St. Nicholas. :D
Fuck yeah, hell yes. Love your work Larian. Best v.o. Team in the industry. Would love to see a BG3 animated series.
This was great! Thank you Larian!
Can we have a whole show please?
Awesome!!! 😂😍😍😍
StopLickingTheDamnThing
Oh the souls I'd give for a whole series of these shorts...
I love these cartoons! 😂
Love the reference "don't even bother licking it" ~Gale
Karlach as Astarion's heating pad is the best thing.
Baldur's Gate 3 the video game: What you think happens in a serious tabletop game of  D&D Baldur's Gate 3 the animation: What actually REALLY happens in a serious tabletop game of D&D
larion studios you can do no wrong :)
My holidays` spirits are complete by this one!  Merry christmas to all and special to the developers of Baldurs gate 3!
Larian once again proves they know exactly what the fans want.  Karlach slowly sinking into the snowbank while Astarion faceplants, and Gale marching with his chewed-on boots... this is fanservice in its purest form.
1:53 🍑
dont even think about licking it! :D
Lucky Shadowheart. Being kept warm by Karlach
Xbox finally got a good game <3
Bg3 mission: save Santa.  Bg3 ending of mission: Santa dead, elves killed, all things that arent bolted down stolen, half of party had fun, half hate you, new sword, used up all rests, encumbered, cursed, and you discover he wasn't Santa after all.
Xbox?! Yay!
These need some random Dark Urge cameos.
Please never stop!
I love it! More! :D
But why have Wyll in it he's easily the worst companion 😭
Merry Christmas, everyone! Thanks Larian guys for this present to fans!
Wouldn’t foots prints be a survival check not a perception? Lol
Gale: "Don't even think about licking it." You can hear licking sounds after he says that at 3:00 (it's very clearly a lick at 3:06). Apparently, the party didn't learn after the spider...
Now I want a Baldurs gate 3 tv series XD
This game has been so deserving of GOTY, and these animated shorts are so quirky and cute that it always makes me wanna come back for more.
I would pay money to see a full series of this kind of content. I love that Larian Studios keeps giving the fan base awesome content, even if its a short video!!
I really need to get this game
What an unexpected Christmas gift. Thanks, Larian! ❤
"Don't even think about licking it" :'D
Me watching this: wow these voice actors sound just like the real OH MY GOD
I say that Larian make a min animated series of BG3 it would be quite fun to watch
I love the fact that the robe is apparently green and just red in front from blood... :D
Karlach melting the snowbank is so adorable.  I love how you all so how much you care by showing the memes and the headcannons and even references to the casts DnD one-shot. Thank you for all the care and love you give the fans.
Such a gift! 🎉❤ Happy Holidays DnD fam
that was so cool loved this animation BRING MORE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ive missed Astarions voice its been like a week at this point and i need my Neil fix
Lie zel licking the x box with gale telling her to stop for some reason made my day.
That's cherry on the pie!
Bae'zel with the doe eyes ❤
저 산타 얼굴을 보니 드로우네...
You're welcome all you XBox users. Enjoy the shear HELLS that await. 🤣👍🥃
Actually the best announcement ever.
LMAO
I swear, if I didn't have kids, Astarion's "Oh for f*ck's sake!" would be my phone's notification alert!  This whole thing is amazing! Thank you so much!
ok who is Geoff!!!?
Lae'zel looking extra fancy today
Brilliant! That's exactly what I want for Christmas  Happy Holidays every1😃
How did you miss the opportunity to have Shadowheart reach in the bag and pull out Bing Bong?!?!  You had one job!
I see someone at Larian has been watching Lost Mines of Phandelver. This makes me so happy. Larian really is one of those cool developers that's actually in touch with their fan base
You guys are doing exactly the right things. 😊 Love this so much.
I that For fuck sakes.
Amazing!!! I couldn’t stop smiling!😭 love you larian!!!
Larian, y’all really setting the bar high. We feel the love❤  - Addicted BG3 player
Now this is how you do a release trailer!
This Fake santa is Drou,Drous lieing
So does everybody's laezel end up getting all the perception checks too? I thought it was just me. My boyfriend even had stats dumped specifically for perception and laezel stole that thunder almost every time lol. He was annoyed, I found it hilarious on all occasions.
Karlach lmao
I can't stop laughing.  This was sheer gold.  Well done, Larian Studios.  On all fronts, well done.  *Goes back to playing Baldur's Gate 3*
0:19 please tell me this is a reference to Wrath Clubs Gale is Hungry parody.
You are beautiful, Astarion.
Netflix show? ❤
This is just perfect... Every little detail
0:08 seeing Brett's hardcore phandelver crew there makes me so happy, they're just little guys! .... and the SLAYER.
I would absolutely pay a streaming service fee to watch an animated series of these guys. Are you kidding me....  Also.... Shart clutching Karlach because she's "cold". LOL
Can you like please make a whole series in this animation style? A mini series at the very least?
Wyll's present and his reaction to it had me actually laughing out loud, thank you for the great content Larian!
Can Netflix make Baldurs Gate show just like this? It would be PERFECT 😂
Amazing 😍
Well that's a fun way to make an announcement!
I love how Gale eating shoes is now made 100% lore accurate
Yeah! Tommy the goblin slayer.
As someone with the name of Geoff it pleased me to see that skeleton.
Karlach and Shadow Heart are so cute together lol
kinda want it to be a real series
So just how much coal is Durge getting in his stocking?
What a pleasant surprise; an early Christmas present! 😊 I've really been enjoying these animated shorts; hope there's more to come! 🥰
Not Karlach chewing the wires lmfao
I was like what the hell is this, super just super....what a studio....just keep up the great work!!!
shadowheart about to puke lmfaooo 🤣
Is it bad i was hoping for more in game dice themes added as a holiday treat
I love the cameo of Sylvester, WereTurg, Goblin Slayer (Tommy) and Gabriel from the hardcore DnD from World of IO.  Love the small detail of them being there at 0:09
“Don’t even think about licking it” Gale’s definitely thinking of a certain spider incident
Merry Christmas to fellow BG3 players and All Larian staff who created this masterpiece!
This is the best Xbox advertisement I’ve ever seen
I need more lol
I really want to turn the "Oh for Fucks sake" into my morning alarm.
That's a familiar group in the bottom left of the tavern.
I would also be let down if someone got me an xbox. Happy holidays to all!
I know it was already announced about it being on Xbox but this would have been perfect promotion! Wow I loved every bit of this 😂
Karlach melting the snow was a nice touch.
"Don't even think about licking it."  Immediate sounds of licking off screen that continue until Karlach bites the cord. Perfection.
The blood of Swen Vincke killed me 😭😭
Okay I’ll buy the Deluxe edition
hahaha i love these xD
Its so good🤣❤
Was having a horrible day. This made me laugh the first time today. Thank you.
Been playing the game on my phone thanks to xbox remote play. Work is definitely not as boring
Astarion siting on Karlach's lap for warmth is hilarious 😂
So awesome and entertaining. Thank you Larian for your gift to the gaming community. The gift that keeps on giving 🙏.
Даже анонс с шикарным юмором. ХБокс такого подарка не заслужил(:
As an XBox player who is LOVING this game i thank Larian for bringing it to us and your willingness to poke a little fun at the whole situation! Merry Christmas Larian!
Tav is like "I was gone for five minutes. What in the hells happened to you all?!"
Could really just make a show 🤷🏼‍♂️
I love the Sonic, Kunckles, and Tails background characters in the tavern lol thats too funny, Always a smash! Happy Holidays Larian thanks for the wonderful game!!
This is the cutest animation I’ve seen all morning. Props to everyone at Larian for making this!
The Dark Urge coming through the door later being like. "Guy's I fell to my urges again and murdered a bunch of goblin like elves and reindeer."
2:39 "Soft uwu baby Lae'zel" was not on my bingo card for BG3. I don't know if this is cursed, blessed or a mix of the two, but damn, I'm glad I saw it.
"Don`t even think about licking it" - camera moves away and you just hear the licking sounds in the background :D :D :D I broke out in laughter
Keep up the good work @mashed and Larian Studios team. I want to see more awesome amazing animations like these and happy holidays to everyone
I love this and need to get Baldur's gate 3 so bad
Everyone cuddling Karlach is fantastic
Thank you Larian for all the amazing work. Truly a once in a generation game that I will remember playing the rest of my life.
Gale telling Lae'zel to not lick, while Karlach in the back go "full-on" biting it anyway 🤣🤣
FALSE! Astarion cant see himself in mirrors. xmas ruined. XDXD
Ok now I’m really looking forward to the next episode lol 😍
Lae'zel being Bae'zel is all i need in an animation
Laezel is too cute in these animations
I love this, it's so wholesome and every character is exactly how you'd think lol
This is so cute
Nice animation!! 😮 Btw, anyone knows, Larian fixes Xbox saves bug? Can I play now, without fear?
They’re all so cute in these
Wyll's blush and quickly stashing away the Mizora pic is sooo funny 😂
I LOVE this
is it possible to get more of these 😂 this was amazing!
This is the best Christmas gift, thank you to everyone who keeps working to bring these amazing animations for us. We love you, happy holidays!
Unexpected Lost Mines of Phandelver cameo at the start!
0:17 not me laughing hysterically because a friend's player character is named Geoff 🤣
So happy to see laezel and wyll make their animated debuts they're so cute!!!!!
I need this game on Switch just for another video like that.
0:36 Astarion's reaction has me dead💀
These are pure wholesome BG3 gold. So happy they keep the animated shorts going, they’re fantastic!
Is Lae'zel hanging out with Geoff the gay skeleton robot from the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson?!?
we want a entire tv show 😍
Hello again. Thank you for the gifts, we love you. 🐶
The hardcore phandelver crew in the tavern is so cool!!! Freakin love that easter egg and love that campaign!!
LOVE IT!!!!!
<3 <3 <3
KARLACH MELTING THE SNOW LMFAO 😭
Very well done to the cast and crew on this heartwarming Christmas special short! This takes me back to that one Christmas-themed side quest I played during a DnD homebrew campaign I participated as an online player via Roll20! It involved us rescuing Kringle from his arch-nemesis Krampus! =)
Gabriel, Sylvester, Turg and Tommy being in the tavern was completely unexpected to me but I love it
Thanks for the game discount on steam. Happy holidays!
Need a complete series about baldurs gate 3
happy holidays to the larian team and congrats again!!!
Wait, who is Geoff? Is it this Geoff? I just love Lae'zel being happy and I wanna know who is responsible so I can give them proper respect! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Peterson
Я дошёл до второго акта
I love this so much. I would pull out of the sack a whole series of this.
Was that skelly Geoff Keighley?? That's hilarious!
why would karlach bite the cable? XD
Karlach biting the cable like a cat killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Cool, but can yall fix the combat? Most of the feats don't do everything they should, and some subclasses don't work as they should either. Like how Abjuration Wizard doesn't get a charge of Arcane Ward when casting Shield. Which is kind of the entire point of Abjuration Wizard.
i love the part abot hot karlah and i love it all
Okay, I just wanna say I absolutely love this and the following is me very much overthinking more than anything. I am curious. The implication is that the Santa imposter killed beings right? How did he manage to kill anyone? He kinda gives up. Is he just under leveled for the party? I mean, I appreciate the joke, but I do have questions. Like how was he successful before? Why'd he do it? Is there a lore reason about this as an actual character or monster in D&D or is this just this joke? I know his coat is red on the front with blood because the back is green, but despite that, he never shows the party any malice. He just gives up. Wait, and if he is an imposter how does that magic bag work? Did he kill the actual Yule Father or just steal his bag? Why does he just surrender to the party? I mean, I wouldn't wanna fight any of them either, but for what's implied, that he's a con man/serial killer who lures in victims with presents, it's just odd that the facade never drops and he dies without a fight. Again, while the bloodied coat is a clue, it just feels a little off that there isn't more evidence against him. Honestly, I feel sad that he dies with that whimper. I suppose a lot of serial killers might also whimper if they were up against a losing battle. Idk, I just want to feel more like he deserves it because he's just so pathetic. I wanna see that evil in him before he get his just desserts. Well, maybe I'm just overthinking it, but I do love this lil cartoon and everything about it. I just can't help but feel for the elf, even if he is evil. Again, he's just so pathetic! Still Karlach > Kringle, especially Murder Nick.
I said it on twitter and I say it on here again. I hate the fact you made that Mizora joke with Wyll. Imagine if you had Astarion pull a picture of Cazador out of that bag with the same joke - his fans would've hunted you down. But oh for Wyll it's fine. Because Mizora is the sexy lady you can even sleep with in the game. Doesn't matter she manipulated and abused Wyll since he was 17! Who cares about that, right? You already treat him like an afterthought every single time (you still have not fixed the massive discrepancy in content for him compared to the other companions) and then you double down on disrespecting him even more. Do better!
Of course Karlach gets Infernal Engine oil. It was her *heart's* desire, and that engine wanted a tune-up.  Also, Astarion gets cold fastest because he doesn't generate his own body heat anymore.
I'd like a full series of this, like "The Legend of Vox Machina".
I was calling my summoned skeletons and zombies Geoff. Good to know it's canon.
Lae’zel watching Karlach slowly melting her way down the snow in distain is so hilarious XD I definitely need a 12 episode season of this cast animated please 🙏🏻
Fucking Karlach biting the cord!
a jet ski? A beautiful union of form and function
"Oh for f*ck sake!" 😂😂😂
GYATT
Wait… who’s Jeff?
Larian are king
You honored gaming industry. I hope you follow the same way after the success.
You need to make a stronger content filter
These shorts could easily become a series of their own. Love them.
Yall better not agree to make a LIVE ACTION series with Netflix. It better be ANIMATED
Larian with another homerun my guys
This just reaffirms the need for a Baldur's Gate 3 cartoon
I like that the cloak is green but bloodstained
Can we talk about how Karlach calls herself Daddy?
Perfeito larian, quero mais agora 😂🎉 se depender dos fãs a gente vai apoiar 🎉 Feliz natal e obrigada pelo conteúdo
This video was absolutely hysterical.
Gale: "Don't even think about licking it."  Lae'zel: *slurping noises*  guys stop it these are too fucking hysterical
They gave Karlach that rhea ripley ass 😍
fucking finally
So I see Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rose at 0:09, but who else is here? I'm curious.
Karlach melting through the snow and then having Shadowheart and Astarion snuggled up to her for warmth was soooooo cute I almost died T.T
Glorious! Love Karlach in this with all the visual gags about her... high body temp. I was gonna say heat, but that had other implications that were not my intention.
Larian just keeps on giving..
So now even the console peasants can "enjoy" this "wonderful" game. Yay.
Best Commercial Ever. 😂
Astarion sitting on Karlachs lap to warm up 😅
Ive not played the game at all but holy hell, Karlach throughout the whole things had me laughing so much
Just noticed the small detail of Gale when marching in the snow, his shoe has holes in it from him eating it. such brilliant detail
Omg. That was amazing
👏👏👏👏😂❤
My only  christmas wish is to see this as a  a tv show at some point.
This is great :) Will you consider to make Baldur's Gate show?
I hope I'll find Karlach under my Christmas tree
more of these! more of these! more of these! more of these!!!!!!!!!!
Gale playing with Tara was way too adorable ❤️
3:00 "Don't even think about licking it." Fucking lmao
I love how they use Sparkleheart for these
“Geoff” LMFAOO
Wyll, you know full well that Mizora is a 5 at best. Destroy that worthless shit immediately.
took me a second to get why karlach got motor oil
Jajaja 🤣. ¡Feliz Navidad Larian! Nos alegraste el año y, tras el GG3, ya estoy rejugando Baldur's Gate (1), 🙌. 🤣
skeleton geoff? so does that mean craig ferguson is baldur's gate 3 canon?
BAHHHHHHH! It all was Amazing and Lovely but the X-box in The End just ruined it all!! - Marketing :(
Damn, larian you guys truly are the best
Best studio ever
we deserver a whole show like that of BG3
All the little nuances make this so so good lol. Thank you yet again Larian & Mashed!
Great stuff.
im so glad you guys teamed up with mashed, you both make great content also the sonic ocs in the tavern were top tier
<3
lmao awesome!
I feel stupid. Why did santa kill the goblins? Why did the party get angry about that? Am I missing something here?
I would pay serious money for a continued series, this was golden.
Oh my God, please make more of those!
Holy shit I don't recognize anyone else at the beginning but the people at the table in the bottom right are from a dnd campaign brettultimus runs
Karlach melting her way through the snow...perfect.
Man I love this voice team.
I would watch seasons of the companions and their adventures. ❤ ❤❤❤ (The IN JOKES. Astarion drinking Swen ,Gale's licking warnings..)
Thank you Larian Studios for these animated shorts.
This is awesome, i love larian
Shadowheart snuggling against Karlach to stay warm was so cute. I love it. The BG3 cast and Larian continue to do amazing work. I honestly would want a series of the cast doing stuff like this every week.
Not gonna lie it took me a few minutes to realize it's on OFFICIAL Larian Channel! Wow that's a commitment!
You guys are just the best. Merry Christmas.🎄
So great!
Dont even think about licking it 🤣🤣🤣
I wanna know Whomst at Priam drew the micros picture!!
OMG this is a great gift! What a work of art!
idk when this was put together but why isn't Astarion laping his drink? We established Bingbong in lore.
Nice one Larion! Gj
@Larian, the gift for Wyll. physical deluxe edition available at merch store when?
i love laezel omg
Congratulations on getting awarded Game of the Year! Well earned!
Love the cameo of the Hardcore Mines of Phandelver group in the beginning, can someone tell me who the other group of adventurers are?
2:55 A fridge!
I love how Karlach is an indestructible, hot engine of pure curiosity and power 😂
This is unreal !!!   Uha ha ha ha!)))
"Dont even think about licking it!"
The sonic gang at the first tavern scene lol
The cameos at the very start are godlike. Seeing Brett's Lost Mines of Phandelver party was a treat.
0:16 is no one gonna talk about the skeleton named "Geoff"? You know, the guy that owns the Game Awards? The one that shafted the speaches of all the awards recipients except Kojima? That includes Astarion's VA Neil Newbon, who was awarded for best vocal performance, and other awards Baldur's Gate 3 won in a landslide.  It's a good reference. Why is no one mentioning it?
MAKE A FULL SERIES
Merry Chrysler to you Larian! LOVE you guys!
holy shit I saw this on twitter and didn't notice all the little bits of karlach melting through everything.
I laughed so hard when Karlach nommed on the cable xDDDDDDD
Now I wish shadowheart said “heal” like that as a rare voice line for healing word or something  3:14
Idk why but Karlach just going right to biting the cable is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time
why was he eating a boot
Plz make this an animated show I  begging 🥺 I will sign up For any platform y’all put this on
A GEOFF PETERSON BALDUR'S GATE CROSSOVER  Holy crap.  In your pants.
thank you for this christmas gift Larian
i could watch a whole tv series of this.... all i want for Christmas is for this to come out on nextflix plzzz Larian!!
Karlach slowly sinking into the snow because of her heat is everything.
Just adding my comment to the pile saying full series please. love it but craaave more!!!
lmao now i just want to watch bg3 cartoons! thank you larian
Seeing the io characters is kind of funny
Absolutely fantastic.❤
0:59 omg poor Astarion. Him using karlach as a heater to try to stay warm lol.  And there is also 0:35 of him being disappointed and angry that he can't rest lol. Seriously if Larian studios were to make a show of bg3 I'd watch it. 100% its funny and cute at the same time lol
Karlach melting the snow is chef's kiss
Gale being a cat person checks out lmao
So.....does this mean we're gonna get an animated series Larian? I think we should go all the way back to BG1, is Kevin Michael Richardson still available?
I love this so much
We must protect Karlach at all cost
0:09 Hello, cameos!
Hi! Does that mean XSX will finally get offline split-screen cooperation?
I love everything about this <3
Gale eating a shoe is the best moment in the entire video
I LOVE these animated shorts. Pls more of that! I'd even pay to see it. Pls make a series <3
All i want for Christmas, is an Animated Baldur's Gate 3 series!!
Would've been hilarious if Astarion got Gale's boots as a gift
I really enjoy these, they pack so much humor and are so much better than regular trailers.
Oh my gosh I love this!!!
El corto estuvo  buenísimo ❤ y vaya manera más entretenida de anunciar la llegada a XBOX.  👏👏👏👏
Love it!
Back again from 2 years ago
Everyone talks of how awesome this is. But nobody is also pointing out the fact that there's some characters from other campaigns here. Like bottom left table there's the group from Brettultimus' hardcore Mines of Phandelver campaign. That's a cursed group.
Can we please just have a bg3 animated series
This was hillarios! Well done :D
Karlach transfers over to cartoons vary well LOL.
Who is Geoff? Who knows?
That was by far the most hilarious bit I've ever watched 😂
Obsessed with Wyll carrying a foot stool with him everywhere so he can assume his heroic pose whenever he wants 💀💀
The head of her enemy preserved in a jar, how did you know?
Karlach just sinking in the snow is great.
this company is rapidly becoming one of my favorites, Merry Christmas
Lae’zel and Geoff was really wholesome
Thank you for your game it's the best birthday christmas for me and myself ❤😂🎉
I love that everyone was comfortable until Wyll forced everyone to go forth and adventure out into a snowstorm lol.
He had a chance - Shadowheart can't hit worth a damn with a mace!
Merry Festag and Happy New Year
I’d watch a regular 30 min series show on just their cartoon adventures
Karlach just slowly sinking into the snow is 🔥
Playing it right now, thank you Larian Studios ❤❤
Gale: Don't even think about licking it. Karlach: *bites it*
I LOVE ASTARION
He really is
Love how Wyll just drag them all to other adventure, no vacations for The Blade of Frontiers
Gale playing with Tara stole my heart. And Wyll's reaction to the signed picture of Mizora made me howl 🤣 I would watch a full animated series like this
how did u make such a masterpiece game in this day and age of wokeness, terrible writing, gameplay, focus only on graphics, greed for money and what not? what is this out of this world sorcery? please continue and never become one of them(bliz, ubi, beth, ea etc.)
Hey, look at us! Look at us! Who would have thought? Not me!
0:17 Is that a Craig Ferguson reference? lol
So much memes and refrences of themself, love it😂
Where is Minthara? Come on, she is part of the gang too.
I need more of these, just directly inputted into the veins. Please
We really need a show like this, the characters and their voices, is just perfect hahaha.
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
You should make a min series of adventures would watch all the time! <3
That was incredible! I love this game so much❤❤❤❤
Once again, Karlach proves to be best girl.
Gods, I identify with Astarion more and more every day!
not gonna lie i love larian for this hahah, thanks for the animation both larian and mashed
Karlach just melting everything LOL. Anyway, I love these animations! The way they also animate skill checks and initiation rolls, lol. Nice how they announce BG3 for Xbox, lol.
Oh Geoff…
Невероятно душевно, товарищи разработчики. Уважаю вашу любовь к вашему творению)
Karlach got the cake 😊
Game of The Year, and Developers of The Decade!
God I love them all so much.
Thank you for everything, you're spoiling us rotten ! merry christmas you filthy animals ^^
Is that Neera making a cameo in the beginning? The one with the pink hair.
Niiiiice! Next stop: cross-platform!
"Initative"... deary deary me.  Gale disapproves.
Love this
You're awesome! With Love from Russia!
Wirklich witzig. Eigentlich schade. Sollte ein ganzer Film draus gemacht werden :)
I love your ad campaign! You are all awesome!!!
Pleaseeee Larian, make a animated series with these characters!!
Happy Christmas 🎁🎄
我現在很冷，我需要卡拉克
Animated TARA!!!
Karlach melting the snow underneath her, amazing! xD
I love how Wyll kinda likes Mizora ;) 1:40
I am now searching for Geoff Peterson and Baldur's gate 3 and i'm not gonna lie, i don't know what i'm looking for but i'm looking.
Blown away by how much you all love the work we've done with Larian on these shorts 🥹 Working with Larian is a dream and it's so much fun working on these with them together. Special shout out to Emily, Molly, Tom, the amazing voice actors and the whole Larian family. Always ready for another adventure with the gang! ❤
I love how you embrace the memes xD
I'm a bit confused about Karlach getting a jet ski 🤔
PLEASE MINI SERIES OF ADVENTURES PLEAAAAAAAASE this just feels like a one shot Christmas adventure!!!!
Geoff Keighley being a skeleton is funny to me 😂 after the game awards haha
Sorry, Geoff. There's not enough time for you to respond. 🤣There's so much to love about this. Can we please have an animated series?
Was the skeleton Geoff Keighly? 🤣
A Million Gold Pieces says they're reating in a TAV-ern
I love this so much. We definitely need more of these just for the fun of it!
If Wyll doesn't like his gift I'd be more than happy to accept it on his behalf 👀
I love the attention to detail to Karlach's heat in the snow
Was not expecting to see Tommy, Sylvester, Gabriel and Turg from Lost Mines of Phandelver in this tbh... I thought this was a fan animation at first then after I watched I looked that it was actually from Larian. Kudos to the Ioverse crew for making it in lol
This is just truly awesome😂
Jeff, you silver tongued Tav.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Said it on the last video will say it again. We MUST have a BG animated series... like yesterday.
00:37   Awful to waste such precious blood !  :-)
Laz'el is soo cute ☺️
LARIAN STUDIOS... the true gift was YOU all along. MERRY SATURNALIA!
Looooooooooooooool
I loved the Paul Rudd Hot Ones reference with Gale at the table 😂
3:00 Gale ya está traumado jaja
Cross play????, PLEEEEEEEEEASE 🥺
MORE DLCS PLEASE
PLEASE KEEP MAKING THESE ugh this was so wonderful lmao
We need an actual animated series, these characters are golden
Everything about Karlach was perfect XD  Also, I love seeing the LMoP Hardcore party making a cameo
WHERE'S TAV
still waiting for Cross-Platform multiplayer.
Awesome!
Who want a full series of this team?
If this game came out on the Switch, that would be my Christmas wish come true!
Fantastic! Love all this community work!
Anyone notice the sonic crew as humans in the background in 0:08
Merry christmas, you beautiful people of Larian and all ascociates: voice actors and studios who have helped create this masterpiece of a game!
I SAW THAT MINES OF PHANDELVER CREW YOU CAN'T FOOL ME!!!
Karlach melting the snow 😂😂
this is the best ad for the game i’ve ever seen
I was not expecting to see the Lost Mines of Phandelver Hardcore characters in the tavern.
Merry Christmas, Game of the Year!
Karlach on the snowbank sent me 😭 Endless creativity with this team.
Whonis Geoff suposed to be?
Okay, never played this game before (barely heard of it) but still find this pretty funny.
I love these sm
Being huddled around Karlach for warmth. Based
I've watched this a few times and keep noticing new details each time. Much like the game, there's always something new to find! 😂
Is there joining to be a crossover animated short with both the cast of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Legend of Vox Machina?
Karlach melting the snow she walks over is absolutely hysterical
We need crossplay!!!!!!!!
All the easter eggs xD. Awesome stuff...  ...Karlach at 1:54 tho
I need an entire season of this
So 1. Larian thank your for making such an awesome game and please assuming you can pay for it and all that I please have more of these made  2. I can't wait to get BG3 for Christmas ^-^
Nice way to advertise. :)
You can’t hide the blasphemy that is Turg from me. It’s only bearable bc Tommy’s there as a distraction
Y’all just really need to go ahead and make this an animated series. It would be very successful.
This was pritty awsome but thats one hell of a sale on Playstation 7 hole dollars lol
Lol making the skeleton Geoff Keighley is hilarious
Y’all can keep making more of these. They are excellent!
Love this
This is excellent!!  BTW, is that Geoff from the Craig Ferguson Show?
I love seeing the "Lost Mines of Phandelver" characters in these fan animations.😍😆
Astarion's "Oh, for fuck's sake!" will never NOT make me cackle 🤣🤣🤣
I love you, Larian! You made my 2023 so awesome! ♥
need this as a series sooo bad
Acting like complete fools is my favorite type of humor 🤣 Happy holidays Larian! ♥
no one talking about the Sonic cast chilling in one of the tables at 0:08 💀💀💀
A Late Late Show Reference? BALLS!
Karlach sinking in the snow because she's literally too hot is just the best
love it
ah, its an advert 💵
Baldur Gate 4 or Divinity 3 or whatever, produce another gem right now and sell it to us, plsss, we're desperate.
Who is Geoff?
Yes! 🤣 thank you Larian for these cartoons
Now we just need crossplay between pc and Xbox ❤
This is hilarious
damn we need a animated show like this of just random events.
You really nailed it :)
Okay that was just too damn funny!!!
I love Karlack slowly melting through the snow
u are literally the best
<3
1:40 👀
LOL That was great!
AMAZING
So, I love this whole thing. Astarion’s “for fucks sake!”, Karlach melting the snow, Gale eating a boot… y’all love your audience and your audience loves you. The only type of “show” I’d accept about this game is if these shorts keep getting made.  Also, at 1:55… y’all know why we’re all here, dontcha?
What a shameless plug 👀
Wow una nostalgia sería lo correcto así y tan increíble y además puede que YouTube está recomendado este buen short animación realmente épico pero bueno muchos van a disfrutar para verlo hasta ahora
Infinitely charming as usual. Thanks for the gift Larian! I hope this isn't the last time we see these characters
Weird silver-haired shadowheart is playing with the artifact. Either shes fucking with  "whatever" might be inside it, or its become a fidget toy to stim with
More
Nice to see Tara in this onee.
BG3 would be the perfect subject matter for a animated TV show, the format for D&D type adventures, it’s perfect
Who is Geoff?!
I'm sorry to be that guy, but no bear love making?  0/10
That was amazing 5/7
AHHH OMG THE WORLD OF IO REF OMFG YOU GUYS
This was cute until the xbox
everything about this was amazing.  i loved the little gags in the background.  you really could make this it's own TV show.
I love you Larian.❤ Such an amazing animation! Loved lovely touches from the community memes. My fav was Gale eating boots and at the end saying “don’t lick it, they did anyways lol. I love being a part of this community, thank you for every work you did and do. Merry Larianmas 🎉❄️
Oh my God!! The Geoff reference on what's in the box is on point!!  Holy crap that's a deep, clever, unexpected cut!! Bravo!!!  Of course he has a place in Baldurs Gate. 😅
I’m surprised no one’s mentioned the different party references in the opening shot of the tavern. I only know 1, the front left, IOverse Lost Mines of Phandelver, the current members, if you know, you know
No Dark Urge? Oh, come on. Nobody should spend Christmas alone. Even our favorite scaly, bloodthirsty albino psychopath ;)
It's 2023, and we've had confirmation that there are still good games companies. Alright, maybe just the one.
Its here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Larian, you are the best!! 🎄🎄
These animations are impeccable, the voice actors obviously are perfect and kill it every time, and on top of it all, it was an ad thats fun to watch.   You could make this a TV series and everyone would watch it!
I love u guys ❤
That was a very clever way of doing that great work.
Yes, Asterian, you are beautiful <3
Lmfao ❤❤❤❤
Brilliant! This was what I needed to get in the spirit.
Seeing the lost mines of phandelver hardcore group at the start was a fun surprise
Why you do karlach like that at the end. Shes supposed to be protected
Is that Geoff from Craig Ferguson's show?
Geoff Ramsey cameo?
We need full cartoon series!
freaking love this, ty <3
Karlach melting into the snow killed me
Brilliant!! 😁🥳 Happy Christmas Larian!
I am in love with these shorts Larian. How I would love more episodes of this.
Какая ж милота!
i just noticed that table right at the start on the top right is the sonic gang, you can clearly see its Sonic, tails, amy and knuckles
This should be turned into a full show! 😂
KARLACH MELTING IN THE SNOW WAS SO FUNNY 😂
I legit almost spit out my coffee when I saw Wyll's "gift" from the bag.
And now I want DLC. Give me more time with these characters, please!
Larian you really need to fix this save/load game error it's happening to so many people and yet you don't fix it iv sent I don't know how many report tickets with no response or any feedback it's really frustrating because I'm 95% done with the game and it just stops working all I can say is I'm very very disappointed
“Don’t even think about licking this one” *licking sounds and soft “stop. Stop that.” In the background*
I love these so much 😂
Karlach sinking into the snow ended me
Heard that BG3 sold the rights to a live action adaptation. Hear me out, instead Mashed is hired to do a full animated series.
Pleaaaaaase we need a full series
That was amazing! XD
Is that tommy the goblin slayer? Who else here is referenced?
All the little visual gags...! I love thoses adds !
Hearing Lazeal licking and Gale telling her to stop in the background is the best part by far
Animated series, with this animation and with the same legendary voice actors. Please 🙏💓💖💖💖💞
Very lovely ❤ Thank you so much guys for making this year special ❤😊
Was that a Craig Ferguson reference?
Heal : ) !!!
An enemies to lovers with Wyll and Mizora would be intriguing to me. After defeating Mizora he doesn't kill her and keep her more as a prisoner or something that later turns into a actually relationship. Maybe have Zariel call her a pet as Mizora did to Wyll and Wyll has to team up with Mizora to get rid of Zariel. Just an idea
Nice bit of detail with the snow melting under Karlach in every scene.
Anyone wanna mention the fact that there's another channel with about a thousand subs that uploaded this exact video 16 hours before Larian Studios and has about 270k views? XD Unless Larian had a deal with that channel to upload the video (say, for ad purposes, to show elsewhere, which makes little sense to me since the video is here), that is actually content theft. "All rights to Larian Studios and Mashed.", huh :p I do love the video! Always fun to see more content with the Baldur's Gate VAs. Karlach melting the snow and stuff. Just sucks that things like what I mentioned above happen. But I figure it's better to bring up a problem than ignore it. They'll sort it out. Just strange that YouTube didn't do that automatically. It's the same video with a little lower quality. Happy Christmas to y'all nevertheless! Look forward to playing the game myself someday :D
Need a series
1:41  Gonna need a full pic of that... for research purposes
Great announcement, keep knocking it out of the park Larian!
Please fix the incessant crashes. Can't even play the game for more than 10 mins before it crashes:( and I wannnnnaaaaaaaaa plaayyyyyyyyyyy
fix the ps5 splitscreen mode instead of making these pointless videos, Larian
Somebody pitch this cartoon idea to an animation studio to produce. Before Netflix tries to make a crappy live action version.
Karlach is still the best.
this is SO cute. if we ever get a bg3 show I hope it's animated!
I desperately need a show of this cast and the Narrator voicing some NPC's in that show 😭🙏
Karlach, my beloved ❤
Aw man, I wish Minthara was here :(
Mommy K sinking through snowdrift and chewing on the power cord is so precious
Adorable.
The voice acting is superb in this, it's deliberately more hammed-up to fit a cartoon, but not to the point of being distracting or making the characters unreckognizable.
Now I want an Animated season of this.
Karlach melting into the snow around the 0:45 second mark was a nice touch. I absolutely love these animation! Thank you Larian!
Kinda sad not to see dark urge... He is so sweet ;c
Stop licking the damn thing!
Merry Christmas, Larian!!! <3
We need a full series. No questions asked. I would happily watch this group go on all kinds of adventures. This captured all their personalities brilliantly.
But... Where's The Dark Urge? Dragonborns are given too little running time T-T
The snow melting around Karlach is hilarious! I also love that she calls herself "Daddy."
Phil: "We need you to put out some more publicity to bring awareness that your game is now on our system. But do it in a cute way."  Larian:
I am pretty impressed that an indie studio that was on Kickstarter not so long ago can manage this kind of thing. You are belgian, we are neighbourg. Let's have hope for your future, Larian, and for your continued care for doing things properly.
This WAS SO FUNNY!!!!!!
0:30 The blood of Swen Vincke 2:34 is this the legendary sword that allows you to summon? 3:01 Don't even think about licking it  These are my favorities elements from the video besides the little details they have for Karlach
>goody-two-shoes endings all canon  I mean I can't say I'm surprised...
^_^
You said that when we had BG3 for the XBox you would also launch support for mods on Steam, is that still in the plans? The video is very good, for me this could become a monthly animated series, and congratulations on GotY
There's too many great moments to even begin, but Gale saying "don't even THINK about licking it".... I about exploded.
Listen carefully at 3:02, there is a distinct sound of licking >.<
THIS WAS AMAZING. Easily one of my favorite animated things I've seen all year.
This needs to be a TV show
AMAZING! Karlach melting into the snow is funny as f**k 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
BG3 was the best earlier Christmas present I ever got!
I love all the details in the animation from Karlach melting the snow to Gale eating the magical boot ❤
Animated Lae'zel is better than in game Lae'zel
This was really fun, adore you Larian studios! I hope yall take time to rest and enjoy yourselves<3
How many memes and fan favourite moments can you squeeze into 3 minutes??? Thank you Larian and whoever animated this ❤❤❤ Happy holidays everyone!
The way Larian uses viral memes>>>>
Is that the Adventure of IO bottom left of the tavern, Wow xd
Holy shit the Mizora pic. Pherb i know who we romance next run.
0:09 team Sonic spotted! Who are the others though?
Skelle Geof knows what a githt warrior woman wants.
When will we be getting the Baldurs Gate skin bundle on Fortnite? 😂 (Please)
That was wholesome and priceless!  Thanks Larian! Will get BG 3 on my XBsX without fear my laptop will go framerate crunching after some hours ( the poor thing needs less intensive games to be happy ) Do wish for cross platform Co-op play and Gem dragonborns + gem dragon ancestries for draconic bloodline sorcerer 😅 And " come to mommy " you mean, Kharlac 😆 Happy holyday and xmas/ yuletider. Sharing is caring and feast yer bellies full! 🎄🎁☕️🍗🥮🥂🫚🍆🍎🍇🍑🍐🍊🧀🥧🎂🍻🥂
This is what the people want.
A damn Xbox ad the entire time…
Love the attention to detail especially lore accurate Wyll
Ok not gonna lie I have no idea if Geoff is a character I didn't meet in BG3, but the second I saw the name I thought he was ,,Djeoph'' from VLDL - NCP DnD :D
Me just being like "I understood that reference" over and over 😂 Yeeeeeeeahhhhh animated gale kitty!!!
1:54 Got what I wanted from the sack
Fun to see Shadowheart and Astarion sticking close to Mama K for warmth.
nice way to let us know that now baldur's gate is aviable on xbox, very original
I would write a coherent comment but I can't see through the tears in my eyes. 😂😂😂
Crap. Now I want this quest
0:43 Soyjack Wyll LMAO
Anyone else notice, Starry's Robe...¿? He Loot Goblined the false Santa's robe. So Starry...✨🧝🏻‍♀️by the HellZ I'm      Beautiful   ❤️‍🩹🗡️🗡️✨                  ☀️🔷🔶🔷☀️🍷
I love you guys. :)
We now need a Baldur's Gate 3 animated series
in the wide shot at 0:09 does anyone know who all the references (besides sonic) there are?
I’d pay good money for these goofy adventures to be a full series.
Karlach melting the snow 😂
i cant believe they put Geoff in there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I never grow tired of these characters, they are so precious 💕
Geoff, is that Geoff?
Maybe I just haven't gotten far enough in the story to appreciate Lae'zels hidden vulnerability, but I feel it would be more in-character for Gale to be cowering in HER arms rather than the other way around!
Bought it today on Steam, waiting for Download to be finished 🤩
Wyll's reaction to pulling out the Mizora portrait sent me. I wish I could see more of this.
That was the single best way to announce a console release I've ever seen.
“Don’t even think about licking it”  What a fantastic callback
Love it. Love everything about it.
an early chrismas present? Thank you!
Where in the hell is Bing Bong?!  :D Thanks Larian for bringing everyone so much joy this year
Bruh I love this fandom so much 😂
I like how Shadowheart and Wyll are in their later forms, whereas Gale is still stuck as a magical boot addict for comedic value.
SANTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
I love you guys for making this
I live for Karlach in the snow. 😂
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK Guys, you are amazing!!! Thanks for this masterpiece 😘
That was cute, including the fried Griswold cat joke. :) That movie was the best from that crazy family. :) Happy Holidays to the entire team.
The fact that Karlach isn't bothered by the cold and is just melting the snow everywhere she touches is so awesome to me, well done!
0:09 looks like someone’s a fan of world of io
Larian Studios.... thats was brilliant thank you! lol
Okay but can we get a full animated series?
This is so freaking cute, I love it so much. I would adore an animated series! ❤
This is so fun. I love how well you're treating the group,  and your community!! We love you Larian.
Пусть ролик и реклама для бокса и издания. Но сделано с душой.
This was incredible
at the very beginning- is the back right table tails, sonic, amy and knuckles in bg3??? omg thats perfect
It makes me really emotional to see a game treated with passion like this. I hope it becomes a trend in this muddy times on the industry. Thank you sincerely, Larian!
I like the reveal how the coat is actually green, but blood stained red
Karlach slowly melting through the snow was perfect.
PLS make a GIF with Karlach in snow. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how Karlach melts. Through all the snow.
Exbawks
Beautiful
Amazing!
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year the amazing team at Larian. Thank you so much for this amazing game and the countless hours of wonderful gaming. The recently added epilogues were so incredible. I hope you all get some quality time to enjoy with family and friends.
Just make an animated cartoon series already!!! 🙏
Why is Astarion, the only undead in the party, freezing cold?
Also, who's Geoff?
So. Good.
What a beautiful animation!  What's next?  Thankee, Merry Christmas, and alleluia!
This should have been used as the announcement at the Game Awards. Instead of.........nothing. lol
1:02 - and to think, if Gale was actually a lvl 13 wizard, he could teleport all of them out of this mess, lol.
Is santa gonna be in the game?
Nice nod to Santa originally wearing green when Astarion is viewing it in the mirror, its only red cause the elves "dyed" it
Astarion being dramatic as always. 😂
Why are companions in this game so unlikable? Only good one is Mincs
This is awesome 😁
I love you Larian for incleible experience 😍😍😍
Stop licking the damn thing!   Christmas themed Astarion, consider me pleased.  All I wanted for Christmas was him.
My God, I'm beautiful.🤩 Merry Christmas to all!
We may have been snubbed of a GOTY speech, but hey I’m glad we at least got this as an announcement
Am I the only one who thinks the oversized <spoiler> at the end implies that the world of BG3 is tiny, as if they were miniatures on a table? I doubt this was intended just a thought that popped into my head :D
Karlach best girl
PLease never stop doing these.  Karlach melting the snow made me gag.
Ok, but seeing Shadowhart getting warm with Karlach is really cute 1:01
I played over 300 hours on my low end pc. Lowest settings and still laggy with occasional graphics issues. Damn near unplayable sometimes due to lag. All on my end due to my old PC. All this to say, those 300+ hours on lowest settings were AMAZING! This physical deluxe edition for my ps5 can't come soon enough! Such a great and fun game, I can't wait to sink sooo many more hours into it when I can play it as it should be played :D
Yall dropped it silently and luckily my stepdad caught it as soon as it dropped. Deluxe version secured
Wait. Where's the dark urge?! OH GODS THEY'RE LOOSE!!
Merry xmas to us!
So was Santa an OX...an Apple?
Not the licking noises as soon as it pans away 💀
Did you know: the animator who made Karlachs boobs bigger is deaf. This is because they keep receiving thunderous applause for such an outstanding decision
0:09 I was not expecting to see IO's hardcore group in this,  good thing they put a bag over turgs face, even still Gabriel looks disturbed 😂 Tommy's living his best life and Sylvester is barely clinging to it as usual
Not Gale literally forking a boot 🤭
This is genius. I love it! One of the many reasons why you guys are the best😂😂
Thank you for another wonderful and hilarious animation! I love them so much! 😂💜
Larian Studios I love you !  I adore these little Baldur's Gate 3 cartoons and there's one coming out right on my birthday!  Too happy !🥰  I'm going to ask Santa for a whole series now !😄
Love you all.  Merry Christmas !! ❤ 🎄
Need more of these!
LARIAN I BEG OF YOU TO KEEP MAKING THESE ANIMATIONS THEY’RE SO MUCH FUUUUUN
I've just reached the Emerald Grove in my first play and have many questions about some of the character design changes. 🤔
These animations are priceless.
We need more animated episode !! This is too good. Take all my money !
That's odd, I saw this on another channel which was uploaded 19hrs ago - how did a random YT channel get this before you guys released it?
Lovve these so much!
Larian, you guys are freakin awesome! Happy holidays to you all
The only way Netflix should get to do anything with this is if larian studios actually does it and Netflix is just paying for it.   also we need the whole cast from the game. And no live action nonsense.
This actually cracked me up lol
We need like a thousand more of these animated shorts.
Pls don't attack me but can y'all make Normal difficulty actually Normal 😂 that'll be the perfect Christmas gift for someone who doesn't celebrate it lol
this was great, i love hearing the voice actors voicing 2d animated versions of themselves
"Blood of Swen Vincke 1972" must be a super powerful potion at this point, the man's at the top of his _game_
Why yall make karlach so "well designed". Not complaining
If you look closely at the party of the pink haired girl in the beginning of the video. They look like a somewhat human team of Sonic, Amy, Knuckles and Tails (though their races are obviously not human since they all have pointy ears. I can't see Amy's ears so I can't tell if she's human or not). I also can't tell the class of Sonic but Amy is probably a Cleric (most likely with a mace and shield), Knuckles is a Monk and Tails is probably a Wizard.
I cant have enough of those characters, thoe voices.
Please do a whole series in exactly this style
Amazing!!! Great job yet again
It gets better every time I watch it
honestly at this point if there is a Netflix show, i would MUCH rather it be these animations over a live action. these are so much fun!
That “Oh, for f***’s sake!” from Astarion is my favorite part.
Karlach slowly melting through the snow was funny lol
I'd LOVE to see a mini series of this!
Incredible work as always! :)
Why can’t all advertising be this fun?
I want Daddy Sven as an Yule gift. I hope he gives me a HARD GIFT
This was too good! I definitely need more 😂
I have a young kitten, so Karlach's first response when greeted with a cord being "chomp" had me dying.
The little details dude, they're everywhere
1:00 Astarion sitting on Karlach's lap is such a vibe 🤣 What a game studio Larian is, really intouch with their audience 👏
Gods Karlach is so..     Hot
Awe, Karlach was melting the snow... Just like Sam melts my heart❤️‍🩹 😅🎉🏰🏰🎀🎁🎀🎄🎄🎄🎀🎁🎀🏹🏆 Merry Christmas, Happy New year Larian!! Everyone.  👩🏻‍🚀🐶✨🌜✨❤️‍🩹🗡️🗡️🔷🔶
Karlach eating power cables is such goblin energy I love her
I hope that Sven took his 'Bloodless' debuff with grace and courage? Also...those initiative rolls...they look terribly accurate. 8P
i love it!
Plot twist: that’s not Santa, it’s Ketheric Thorm
So Santa ate his elves and reindeer after the crash? Or was it all trap from a santa impostor?
PowerPuff Girls
Ferguson says hi to his old friend ;)
divinity elf lol
THANK U LARIAN...U R AWESOME!
This is beyond awesome. Thank y'all for this!!!!
More please!  These are so fun!
STOPLICKINGTHEDAMNTHING
I need more! This goofy style, all the fun accents! I need full anime season every year!
This gave me such Christmas joy. I love these characters more than some people in my actual life. XD
Hahah amazing! Thanks for the laughs!
We need an oficial series with this cast. Something like Vox Machina will be amazing. Or even shorts. I just know I need more.
Thank you for having passion for your product. What a game and what a standard to set in this age.
I love that the skeleton is named Geoff, I just wish he was wearing a suit. EDIT: The Santa hat was good though.
DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT LICKING IT LMAOOO gale getting flashbacks from the spider
love it! and thx for bring it to xbox, but. could you fix online?
Baldurs gate 3 full conversion animation style confirmed ^^
I love these animations shorts! Please make them into a series! We would all watch it! Keep the VAs like these videos!
Adorable.
I love how they did the Paul Rudd Hot Ones meme with Gale and his projection. With the shoe eating meme no less
This game has stolen my life away…. And I’m so happy about it
I too would cuddle up to Karlach in the snow lpl
You guys are the best make more,and please create some encounters like Rafael the music the atmosphere the drama was the best part of BG 3,Merry Christmas
Amazing
I wish we can see more of durge hanging out with the party
Meh, wasn't as good or funny as the last one.
Haha Astarion drinking Sven’s blood
So, how long till a Mod group, or Larian themselves, releases a content pack that just replaces everyone's avatar with theses adorable cartoon versions of the main cast?
I wonder what Dark Urge is doing right now.
NAHH NOT KARLACH MELTING THE SNOW HAAHAHHAA
I love this Ad
I kinda wish the elf they found was either halsin or minthara
Ah yes, Santa. My favorite Wizard of Thay XD.
Guys I want more!
Karlach just sinking in the snow
The open title said nudity, where's the nudity. Where's my naked Karlach or shadowheart? Hmmm? LIES!
I would watch a whole cartoon series of this cast. Hilarious! Happy Holidays!
Wouldn't mind seeing these regularly.
Stuff like this makes me love this game a million times more
Larian! I need a weekly-ish webisode just like this of the misadventures of the by companions!
Don't even think about licking it?!?! YOU CANNOT STOP MEE!
merry xmas everyone <3
Karlrch melting the snow 😂
Absolutely glorious :D
Is Swen a vampire now? 🧛‍♂
lae’zel being so happy about her gift sent me into a huge fit of laughter, can’t wait for more animated shorts with these characters, these have been masterpieces
Karlach sinking in the snow had me rolling!!😂
i dont get it, what did elf santa do?
Omfg!!! Please do these all the time!!!
These animations make me feel like a child i love them so much.
I love how Karlach slowly melts through the snow xD
Is Gale the same dude that voices Alistair?
Wait What happened to SWEN
That was best advertising EVER! Also you should do series, this is brilliant.
I can understand Astarion, given he already runs cold by virtue of being undead of course the snow wouldn't agree with him hence why he passes out and needs to stay warm on Karlach, poor dear.
People are (rightfully) talking about the gorgeous animation and fantastic VA, but I just want to appreciate the attention to detail when it comes to the characters’ personalities.
To everyone at Larian Studios thank you for making one of the greatest games of all time and also have a Merry Christmas.
To echo everyone else: This is amazing, your team is amazing, the voice actors are amazing, and we all want to see a full series of something like this. Happy Holidays!
Platinum Blonde Shadowheart is a nice touch. Good to know that canonically Aylin and Isobel are doing well.
raign check please 😅
Where I can order MizoraXXX?
That is just awesome.
Is the Gale "look at us" a Paul Rudd Hot Ones reference?
I love the attention to detail in this, love that the VAs voiced their characters for this too
"Ooh, another box!" "Don't even think about linking it" 😂😂😂
incredible
This needs to become a series! :o
LIVE ACTION MY ASS. THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. PERIOD.
i will be a larian fan and continue to buy their new games for LIFE
I hope these never stop. They are TOO good.
Karlach melting the snow wherever she goes 😂
Shadow cuddling up to Karlach is so damn adorable ❤
You are truly rocking it.
Cake ahead
xD  ...Laezel just watching Karlach melt through the snow; completely unamused.
I wonder how many of the cast members catch themselves saying "Gods dammit" irl........... lmao
Shadowheart hugging Karlach’s arm to stay warm was adorable.
An incredibly entertaining and cheerful reminder that there aren't nearly enough taverns in BG3.  😉
I really wish this was a monthly series or something lol
Keep coming  this serie😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
About time Xbox got a good game 🤣
This cracked me up! As someone just getting into BG3 this really brought a smile to my face. I love our beautiful and chaotic friends. 😂❤️
The fact that they got the io verse hard core campaign peeps in the intro makes me know they game I'm buying next
These are amazing 😂 Larian is the gift that keeps giving. Thank you for doing these fun shorts! ❤❤
Is "Geoff" supposed to be Geoff Keighley?
Absolutely incredible! Ya'll make the Best content
0:18 The Skeleton's name is Geoff... it's that's a jab because of what happened at the game awards? Lol.
Wtf is Gale doing to that boot XD
They gave Karlach a WHOLE BAKERY GYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAT
All I want for Christmas is for Shield Bash to work again
It’s really a shame that this is underperforming cause some rando youtube channel stole the video and posted it 15 hours earlier then this, therefore syphoning all the views it would have gotten. It really bothered my that the stolen one was the first video in my recommended page when I loaded youtube
This makes me want a true crime series staring: Detective Lae'zel
Hey Xbox players! I hope you guys have a great time playing. Hopefully you all love the story as much as the rest of us.
Gods, i LOVE this goofyness
DO MORE OF THESE!
Xbox bros let's go enjoy!
1:53 was MY christmas gift wow i was not expecting her to be drawn like that
I was kinda hoping Karlach was going to get a new heart....  Proper Karlach DLC when?
Thank you to all the wonderfully talented VAs and Larian Studios!
These are so good. I feel like we totally need an animated series with them just going on silly adventures. Theyre that good!
Don’teventhinkboutlikingit!
“Don’t even think about licking it”
Laezelle drinking with Geoff Peterson made me so happy.
PLEASE NEVER STOP MAKING THESE
Don't worry wyll Mizora is a natural treasure. 😂
Lae'zel and Astarion's side eyes at 1:34 while the rest are mesmerised, plsss 😆😆😆
Can we all agree Larian owns D&D now and is gracious enough to license it to WotC
and where minthara?(
2 hours ago..? But I saw this video yesterday!
HOW WAS THIS AN AD IM SOLD 🎉
and just like the game, I had to replay it a few times to catch all the little details. Awesome
My gods this was hilarious
The voice actors are amazing, are they the same people from the game? They sound uncanny
Happy Holidays Larian Studios!
No cap, I would happily pay to watch an original animated series of the BG3 party fourth wall breaking to push adverts to sale the game.
Karlack mealting through the snow hahaha
Karlach melting the snow 😂😂😂
You can hear someone licking it right after Gale tells them not to lick it ^_^ Larian knows us so well.
2:27 should it be "Initiative"?
When a studio can laugh and know the memes about their own games, it' just magnificent
Damn wyll hot for mizora  Kinda weird tho
STOP LICKIN THAT DAMN THING
Wyll keeping the mizora framed picture, karlach sinking, astarions disappointment, and gale saying “don’t you even think about licking it” fucking kill me. Love this game, animation, its actors and community
Is that the skeleton of Geoff Keighley? If it is, I love it!
0:36
Karlachs heart desires motor oil because it's an engine.
Larian studios KNOWS their fans and community. 😂😂 I was smiling like a doofus at this whole thing
im so glad wwe got this animated miniseries to see more of the characters in less serious settings. ive never felt like i knew a group of people who arent real so well.
Karlach melting in the snow..lol
Who is Geoff?
Возможно не стоило отправлять Карлах обратно в преисподнюю, а стоило лишь отправить её в зимнюю локацию
Tommmmmmy! He is such a good lad! Sylvester and Turg too.
Me: Oh for Fuck shake lol
I really want to see Minthara or Halsin in one of these
I want more "Wyll make them go on an adventure he won't stop talking later" material
"Oh for fucks sake 😥" and "don't even think about licking the damn thing 😠‼️" have fulfilled my life in so many ways (especially Astarions line 😂)
:43 soyjak Wyll
Astarion sitting on Karlach😂😂😂
I love how cute they all are.
Karlach melting into the snow and then Shadowheart snuggling up on her for warmth!!!!! 😂❤❤  "My enemy's head preserved in a jar!!!" oh my god, I love this studio.
No one commenting on Santa eating the helpers and the animals to survive? That was dark...
Everything about this was hilarious and heart warming. Loved it!
The best game studio in the world
i need that mizora pic in the biggest poster i can find
Okay I don't normally double comment but omg this is hilarious and I need more lmao
Please tell us you guys are working on a BG3 animated series with at least four seasons.
I’m not gonna lie I love these small little animations there the best
Is.. that table in the back sonic the hedgehog and crew as adventurers? LOL
Thank you all for such a wonderful and enjoyable game. A blessed Christmas to you all.
I love this game so much. This truly was an early Christmas present.
I would watch a actual show like this. They made an unforgetable party.
This animated short was actually longer than The Call of duty campaign
Bravo, absolutely stunning, the best gift I could’ve asked for this Christmas. Thank you 🎁
You guys should make a Christmas event for when exploring you get attacked by Santa and his elf’s and when you defeat them you get a Christmas bag and one of the rewards could be an insanely op piece of gear,gold or a whole rank up
Please create a cartoon series... please?
Holy crap IO gang got referenced 0:10. Awesome appreciation Larian!
Is the Larian studio intro when the game boots up supposed to make a noise?!?
Gales gift fkn killed me. LMAO
3:06 karlach biting the power cable XD. She is literally just a big puppy and you can’t convince me otherwise
This would make a very cute show.
Omg the two Gales "Look at us. Look at us!" I am dead lmfao
Omg why is Lae’zel the cutest in this?
🌲❄️⭐🌲⭐❄️🎁
please make an animated series like this 🥺
Twist ending, Santa is secretly a Bhaal worshipper
Oh my god this was great, so glad you all got the cast to voice everyone! 10/10 on Karlach sinking through the snow, Astarion sass, and Shadowheart/Karlach snuggles.
Ya'll need to just commit to doing an anime already.  Just one season, at least.  Tell the actors they have steady jobs, and just go wild!  But seriously, this is great.  I specifically left comments on the PS5 one BEGGING for an Xbox launch video when the time came, and this does not disappoint!
I hope we see many more shorts
Now add playable kobolds, aarakocra, and other cool races.
I didn't see that this was from Larian and that makes this even better! Thanks to all the team and voice actors for making it! As a side note, I would pay all the money for this to be an ongoing thing. Just saying.
0:54 god i love the attention to detail in these. Karlach melting the snow.
"heal~" 😍
I think you guys should consider making a legitimate series out of this in the same vein as The Legend of Vox Machina.
забавная рекламка, годнота)
Merry Christmas to Larian Studios! At least I know what I am doing this holiday season.
Why is the vampire cold?
I love this company
The fact that there are still hundreds of thousands of people playing this game even months after the release (including me), shows how much the community liked Baldur's Gate 3, this game is one of the best Dungeons & Dragons adaptations made to this day, be proud of it and keep the great work.
Why is no one taking about Astarion drinking Swens blood?!?   Also: nice try Orin!
I LOVE this SO much xD Laughed my Ass of so hard xD Everybody involved is Epic and i Wish you all the best Holidays! Thank you all for giving us such a great Game, this Animation Gems and all your heart🤘🤘🤘😍 Greetings from Germany 🎉🎉🎉
If it were me, id have lampshaded the fanservice ladies gear by having Shadowheart shiver and complain about underdressing for a snowstorm. 😂  " Ive got frostbite in places I cant mention ! "
Gods, you guys are legendary. You keep giving the community treats and actually respect us. I doubt we will ever have another studio go to such lengths and leave a lasting impression on the gaming industry like y'all have.
This was my joy for the Christmas season ❤ Thank you Larian Studios!
Someone made a YT short about a week ago about this being released on Xbox around when the game awards came out. I’m already ahead so let’s F***ING GO!!
This was surprisingly funny/good!
I just loved Geoff refference :)
Great Comic thanks for that any the game of course. Wish you am merry christmas and a happy new year.
TARA!!!
Gale: Meme Gale Lae'zel: Meme Lae'zel Astarion: Fully unchanged, still perfect
Omg! They have the Lost Minds of Phandelver Hardcore party as a cameo!! Yes! My boy Tommy!
I would pay for a cartoon of this.
Astarion looking a bit pale there
Karlach melting the snow took me out 💀💀
Really well made
Christmas hat update when
Including youtuber dnd characters in your animation? Nice.
i love it ♥
I love Astarion's disappointment it is so funny, please make more shorts
Is that the fucking Geoff cohost skeleton from Craig Ferguson's old show???
I've lost a 40 hour save, and a 20 hour save on my Series X and I'm still jumping right back into a third hoping for better luck this time because the game is so good. But, I'd prefer to keep my saves lol, also enabled cross-save so fingers crossed!
I love when a game studio feels so in tune with their audience. This felt like a passion project.  Very much deserving game of the year!! 💗
Gale and Gale's apparition referencing the Paul Rudd "Hey look at us" meme from Hot Ones 😂 Im dead
Everything with Karlach is hilarious. I'm not biased! I swear... okay maybe I am. 😆
All i can say is thank you Larian!!! Again
Karlach melting the snow is so cute 😭 Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone
i love you all ❤  I want a resurrection scroll for Bing bong!
Larian, this needs to be a show!!! 😂❤
Not Astarion admiring himself in the mirror… well trying to 😂😂😂
Karlach melting through the snow had me laughing.
Wait is the reason karlach engine is like thet because she just needs a oil change
ok Karlach's defense, she DID NOT lick the 'thing'.. she took a bite~
Oh my gosh. Why was I not expecting their actual voices? This is brilliant. 🥰
Make this show already!!!
Thank you so much for making one of the best video games of all time. Your staff is amazing for their creative story and programming, and your voice actors truly live in our lives as their characters.  May you and yours have a blessed holiday, much deserve rest, and we all look forward to what more awesome works you may bring to the world.
1:54 Looking respectfully...
Can we get any official word on if the black map issue will ever be fixed for older GeForce cards? So hard to play with a black void as a map, every patch I hope to load up and have a map 😂
Karlach melting through the snow was just perfect
Joke's on you: Elves don't grow facial hair. In fact elves don't really "grow old" to begin with, it's more that their soul ages instead of their body.
Love it. And I am so happy to hear our wonderful voice actors working together on their characters again
Lae'zel is so cute in these omg
Astarions "My god I'm beautiful." at the end absolutely killed me 😂
If anyone had plans on getting this game on Xbox be warned there is a player wide bug where you lose your save games. I lost 60+ worth of gameplay down the drain. I recommend not playing until the bug can be squash
1:53 GYATT-
MERRY CHRISTMAS      EDIT: Oh, well that blatant ad at the end sours everything. 😒
❤❤❤️🎮😀👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Honestly, I hope we get to see a whole TV series like this. Not even just because I'm a fan of Baldurs Gate but the art, the voice acting, the characters and the endless (D&D inspired) storytelling potential is endless. Whoever has been writing the scripts for these are amazing, the comedy is TOP tier and the animation and art style pairs brilliantly, breathing life into the characters so perfectly!! Regardless of, I absolutely LOVE seeing these animated shorts and seriously hope we get to see more into the future!   Huge love for the whole of Larian Studios, the voice actors and everyone else behind the scenes to bring this amazing title to us, and continuing to update it lovingly with new and exciting content. I can't wait to see what else you all make into the future.
my god the bloom and brightness
Never have I ever seen a game studio so in touch with their own design humor! Gale eating boots! Karlach sinking in the snow, and Baezelle being the tsundere...May gamers enjoy and wishlist your games for decades to come LARIAN! You deserve your station.
Larian is the f-ing best.
Jesus, I took a drink RIGHT when Karlach bit the cord... nearly needed my own revivify spell there...
This is Amazing!
0:40 needs to be a poster in the merch store. Or a displate!
I've seen this yesterday on some obscure channel. Don't know how they managed that.
Is nobody going to point out how wyll did the Soyjak point?
Laezel 💓
I LOVE U WITH MY WHOLE HEART 😍
My 3 favorite followers snuggled up in the cold. Karlach, Shadowheart, and of course my bby girl Asterion
Thanks for the sick game. I havent enjoyed an RPG like this in years. This gives me hope that the nerds remaking Kotor will actually make it a CRPG.
Karlaaaaaaachhhh!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🥰
Ahh that was very cute
I just love that the game's actual voice cast participate in these shorts as well
Shit. Make it an actual show now. Thanks Larian!
omg that vintage bloodd killed me hahahahaa
This had no right being this good, Karlach melting the snow F'ing sent me LMAO
Gods everything about this was so funny. xD
Thank you so much for this!
I appreciate the Road to El Dorado reference with the lute guy at 00:09
I want some blood of Swen Vincke!!
I love how if you pause to look at the first shot of the tavern theres a group of people at the table to the right thats just Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles
I love you all! Thanks for this. Put a smile on my face! <3
Gale eating shoes 😂
Astarion going OH FOR FUCKS SAKE and Karlach going :3 make my heart warm. Thank you so much.
Fuck netflix!!!! DO AN ANIMATED SERIES
These boots have seen everything
Lol 😂 love it
Tis the season.
A little late no? 💀
Please make this a full fledged cartoon series.
i'm so in love with this and with larian and mashed, y'all are really the best 😭😭
My squad of hyper racist radicalists would never kill a fellow goblin murderer
1:54 Dayum Thank you animators
Whatever this is, bottle it. Give me seasons! I’d pay for it!  Love all the actors participating. Gale eating our gear, with himself. Swen “wine”. Best delivered line, drunken “fuck’s sake”, melting through the snow. Lae’zel existing ❤. Mizora gift Will pretended not to want. Karlach being the best Labrador and biting the cord. Wonderful!
THose shorts are so great they could become a serie on their own XD
Thank you Larian Studios. BG3 is the gift we gamers needed this year and going forward!  (I must beg though, please, please, please address the bug where the game crashes and resets your settings file on PC...its been months now and really is the only detractor)
I like the detail of Karlach melting the snow.
Larian is the gift that keeps on giving lol if they don’t collab with Critical Role and Amazon to make a series what are we doing with our lives 😂
Aw nah you had Karlach CAKED UP when she's grabbing the gift at 1:53
Shadowheart and Astarion cuddling with Karlach is too funny lmao. Shadowheart is loving that too much lol
I love the care and effort that Larian has been putting in for BG3 and hope other studios/developers take note of their success from doing so.
Please make more of these, They are amazing
Merry christmas Larian and thank you guys :)
That's just beautiful. Best announcement ever. Awwwww~
Yo, wtf?! That's the Mines of Phandelver Hardcore team in the tavern at the beginning! Who animated this and why do we share similar beloved D&D shows?
At first I thought some superfan had actually gone in and pulled various voice lines for this. Then I saw the poster.
Where is Dark Urge?
I advise/suggest/plead people to come out of Skyrim and try BG3  Man we need those excellemt mods they have there in BG
Animated Lae Zel is surprisingly wholesome.
GEOFF!!!😅🤣😂🥲😇
I would definitely subscribe to any platform that had a full animated series.
Think my favourite moment gotta go to Karlach melting the snow and heating Astarion and Shadowheart
Karlach just vibing in the middle of a snow storm is a mood
omg i love laezel hahahahaha XD
game of the century
This is GREAT! 🥰🥰
They really need to make this into a show, I'd watch t!
Did they re-release it? Why?
Awesome ❤
I appreciate stuff like this so much gives the game even more life. I hope you guys do something like the 10years witcher animation.
You guys are the best. ❤
Wyll getting a saucy pic of Mizora lmao. I wish that was canon.
Santa only has four fingers.
0:08 *Gasp* Sonic and the gang.
You are one of a kind.
Tav and minthara are too busy ransacking the nearest town to be involved
Gods, those voices! They 'll stay with me for a long time.
Awesome! Loved it 😊
Wtf is gale eating a boot
Please please please keep making these
This needs to be a series!! ❤❤😂  BWAHAHAHAA KARLACH IN SNOW!! 😂😂😂
Omg astraion and Tara just chilling together ❤❤❤❤
the only rhing missing now is durge
Neil is the best. 😂
NAH not wylls present 😂
we need a BG3 series these are amazing
Gonna make me buy a whole Xbox just because of this
OMG Brett's Phandelver Hardcore group in the opening Tavern scene <3
This is perfect, just absolutely perfect. I dont even have an xbox but now i feel like getting one so i can buy the game again.
Karlach melting the ice. makes sense.
Can we have more of this? I don't care if it's to advertise stuff or whatever.
How about an animated long... series?
That Paul Rudd reference was perfect
These BG3 short animations always bring smile to my face.
All I can say is that I hope there’s crossplay eventually! Would love to play with my Xbox friends
Keep pumping these out and I'll sub ❤
Love this!!!! Thank you Larian for such an awesome game. ❤ it's been a blast to play
I loved that so so much ❤️❤️ these little animations bring so much joy to my day every time I watch them!
Let us adopt Myshka!
Wow...that old elf really went Donner Party on his peeps.   I love everything about this.  Never stop making content like this!!
1000000 out of 10 😁
man it's so on point for Lae'zel and astarion just eyeing each other when all the others were excited looking at the bag. And of course they were the two characters to notice something amiss.
Please make this a series!
I love that you made this. Also jealous of Wyll's gift.
When they all lined up on the snow bank I was like. “ yo someone move astarion closer to karlach our boy is freezing to death!” Then in the next scene she’s just holding him on her lap in a blanket. “ oh good never mind”
I could just watch the animations all day
Never thought I'd see Lae'zel jumping in Gale's arms, but here we go  Also, I love how Astarion is constantly shivering and freezing. Then again, he's a vampire spawn and probably doesn't have any body heat to warm himself with. Him cuddling with his body warmth opposite Karlach was both hilarious and adorable  And is that Shadowheart using the prism as a rubik's cube in the beginning?
I love wyll in this. Honestly everyone is perfect. Karlach sinking into the snow is another brilliant detail
Oh wow that was amazing! Just right after my DnD group’s rescue of Saintis Nicolas (yes my DM chose the name).
Astarion fawning over himself despite only being able to see the coat in the mirror was so funny
I wouldnt mind if they did animated series like this.
This was amazing lol
"Don't even think about licking it!" Got me bad
Missed opportunity for a Bing Bong reference 😂
Astarion sitting on Karlach's lap to keep warm!! Just everything about Karlach in this is gold
Karlach is so lovely! <3
Karla he casually melting her way through all the snow was delightful
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stoplickingthedamnthing!
Harry Partridge ❤
This actually wants me to have a festival situation in the game like prior to act 3 😂 Like a zone where is superfriendly at first and your alone, mission is you've got to pick items for each campmate. And they'd do the same, then you speak to withers and everyone celebrates or hates their gifts 😄
Great. We need a cartoon series like this!
Larian truly knows how to treat their fans. Merry Christmas everyone!🎄
A crummy commercial, son of a *   Merry Christmas :)
Welcome to the family, Xbox users🎉
God damn I love them!
I want that Mizora picture. It's for a friend...
I didn’t get the cloak is stained red not actually red 😂
Thank you so much for bring to Xbox x series
Astarian sitting in Karlach 's lap is everything
2:30 Never seen anyone roll that high on initiative in-game 😂
Hol up is that the io crew in the tavern at the same time? :D
Fiiiine, I'll start another play with Tav as Santa and every time I give the party an item I'll pretend it's a christmas gift. I'll make them sit on my knee and all that...
Astarion just chilling and enjoying a comfy robe is a mood😂
WE WANT MORE WE WANT MORE WE WANT MORE!!!! MINI SERIES PLEASE!
Thank you so much Larian! Best game I’ve ever played!
'Oh, for fuck sake' helarious.  In need that as my ringtone😂
STOP LICKING THE DAMN THING
Vampire feeling cold! LMAO
Please make an animated series! I'd pay for that!
Basically, even Mizora's relationship with Wyll is toxic, he still likes her?
Everything about this was perfect. Thank you for putting in the extra effort to make this kind of content for us too!  I know it's not likely to happen, but I would SO love an animated series following the crew, kind of like Vox Machina did.
I love the visual comedy more than anything probably. Karlach heating up the snow and melting away while Lae'zal looks on, Shadowheart holding on to Karlach for warmth while Karlach looks at her suspiciously, Karlach biting the cable....maybe I just like looking at Karlach. But honestly, the background holds so many jokes and nice moments throughout.
I want 4 season, 24 10 minutes long episodes each, with a mix of episodic and story driven storytelling. FOR YESTERDAY!!   Any productor worth their weight in gold would make this happens.
Karlach melting through the snowbank was the greatest.
Got these voice actors working over time lol
Lae’zel Supremacy ❤❤🎉🎉 Marry Christmass!!!
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
Shadow hugging Karlach like a heater, just gold😂
Love the Lae'Zel and Geoff Scene xD
Thx Larian, u all are GREAT!
Larian ❤
man, so creative
I want this as a series!
Oh man, i want a series so badly. Please Larian, hear my prayer
Whos Geoff
omg this could be a animated series too XD its soo good
Lost mines of phandelver hardcore chaos crew 😆😆😆 0:09
When did Astarion find the blood of an elder god??
We do an annual Christmas dnd session. We play as enslaved santa elves and santa is a lich punished by the gods to be a good lol. Last year we fought Krampus.
Lae’zel looks so cute at 2:41.
救命有夠可愛🥹🥹🥹🥹
...is Larian telling us that Geoff is dead to them?  I'm not complaining.
WE NEED THIS AS A SHOW!
I thought this was fan made animation and so many thoughts ran thru my head -the animation is cute -wait,the fans did a really good job with the VA,they sound so similar -wait,they used dialogue frm the game? i dont remember them saying these in game then i saw larian was the uploader
Karlach melting the snow😂😂😂😂
if i was acharacter i would be all over shadowheart aaa..... Santa so we meet once again "takesout quad blaster repeating cannon" so where is my dragon ya <redacted for the next trilions of pages>
Thank you, Larian Studios! For the game, this mini series (I hope for more - I would pay for it), all the updates, the High Rollers Special and so much more. It's so obvious you love us fans! Have some happy, relaxing holidays and a wonderful new year!
Mooooooooore we wants mooooooore 🤤
This should be made into a full show like S.Park or Simpson, this is way to awesome.
0:16 BALLS!
WAHHHH?! An F bomb? UNCENSORED?!?
The voice cast deserve to be stars; I hope they get a ton of high profile work for the rest of their careers.
2:37 I would never guess I would giggle on happy Lae'zel
My favourite part was Wyll's gift, his little blush was so cute!
I love y'all so much for this. Merry Christmas, Larian Studios and everyone involved in this game.
Shadowheart cuddling Karlach at 1:00 is so cute! And Lae'zel's face at 2:40 is absolutely adorable.
Hahaha a fantastic gift from Larian and Mashed. Many thanks to both teams.
Lmao thank you BG3 for a fantastic year! Hope you all and your teams have a wonderful holidays!
i love these so much 😭🤎
Well played, Larian. Well played...
Cute
0:36 I need this as a text alert.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH 😭
Geoff is life <3 - i would love to play a revived skeletal character ngl  Keep these coming Larian! tbh id be super down for y'all to make a series at this point
Lmaooo this man Wyll helping thr first person he sees is too accurate 😂
Everything about this was awesome.   Larian, y'all rock.
Geoff stealing Laezel's heart 1 preserved head in a jar at a time
They forgot to ad a medal to Astarion Or a prize to be accurate
Oh I LOVED this!!! Now to watch it like 10 more times.   Thank you Larian and everyone who worked so hard on this and the Xbox release! Merry Christmas! 🤗
I would love a baldur’s gate animated series on netflix
Man how did I see this before it officially came out what
One of the few ads I've watched all the way through.
Thank you Larian and team!
1:33 perfect
Have y’all watched Vox Machina?
I love Karlach's interactions so much, she is adorable as a heat source in winter
Who's Geoff?
Wait, who is Geoff?
We need Dark Urge to tag along
Gotta include my boy Durge in the next one, come now.
I bought and tried downloading BG3 yesterday and my computer died.... Today I managed to bring it back to life, and now trying to download the game on an SSD, hopefully that'll be the last of it.  "First part of the game is like 70 hours+ long !".... yep... yep indeed..
We already love you Larian you dont have to overdo it :)
Baldur's Gate, the little serotonin molecule that could. ❤
What an amazing cartoon. Everyone involved understands and breathes life into this party.
Thank you Larian! Merry christmas !  We hope for a Baldur's Gate 4, and 5, and 6 , and 7, and..if you could be at same level is a critical 20 !
“Don’t even think about licking it.”
This is amazing
Don't even THINK about licking it.
Larian never stop
Geoff?
Que genios como presentan una publicidad y la hacen maravillosamente. Quiero una serie completa!
Thank you for making BG3, it led me to playing BG2. two of the best games i have ever touched
Astarions "for fucks sake" just had me DYING
Lazel looks so cute in this animation
Karlach melting the snow tho 😂😂😂😂
Not sure why you are treating your fans like children
True chads of game industry
Turns out Wyll and I have the same wish.
I love this 😂😂😂😂 thanx to Larian and all the perfect actors (again).
Please make an animated series. I'd watch the hells out of that.
Where would one acquire a picture of Mizora like 1:41? Asking for a friend. 👀
Can you guys make a tv show? This is gold
Larian can you make a Discworld RPG next?
Every second that Karlach is on the screen is pure bliss.
Thank YOU KING!!
Who is the Geoff skelleton Lae'zel is hanging out with. I feel like I'm missing something.
I want a cartoon series like this 😂❤
i love this shit so much im dying
you know what this means dont you Sven ?  Now we, the player base, need some Christmas themed DLCS
Happy Holidays Larian, amazing work as always.
every single detail in this is SUBLIME
What a way to announce the Xbox release!!!😂😂😂😂
0:18 haaa is that Paul Rudd reference in the interview First we Feast - Hot Ones? Love it
Another absolute banger
"Tav"ern lives in my mind rent free
Congrats to XBOX owners! That's an amazing Christmas present! A little miracle from Larian ❤❤❤ The part with Karlach on the snow was hilarious 😂😂
I would not at all mind if you kept this skits going.
But Santa my wish was a DLC
Pure cringe
YESSSS MOOOOORREE!!!!
Ok I’m a bit confused did the Santa elf ambush and eat those people and reindeer?  And was planning on doing the same to the rest of Tav’s group?  Also was his cape originally green and was dyed red in the front because of the blood???  Or am I missing something about why his clothes are two different colors 🧐
Since I have barely even started to play yet (just got out of the Nautiloid, curse all this Adulting! 😅), I'm gonna save this to watch sometime much after Christmas, I'm afraid 😄
That was really funny actually
Merry Christmas Larian!
This is the best commercial for the Xbox version of a game ever.
Please keep these animated series coming. They're AWESOME!! 🎉
So, who at Larian is the “Hot Ones” fan. I know a Paul Rudd Easter egg when I see one.
LOVE the El Dorado meme reference at 0:09 you guys are hilarious 🤣
Wyll and Mizora 🤣
God I love this studio! Was lowkey sad this wasn't a DLC announcement haha but it was hilarious
Doesnt matter where she shows up, Karlach steals the show. Just every moment is golden lol
So good
Karlach is the best campfire you'll get, she's literally *hot*
I love the implication that Wyll is permanently carrying around a footstool in case he needs to make a dramatic proclamation
Larian can no shit start a netflix animated series.
I am so happy for this. Everything Larian Studios have done is amazing. The hours spent in cheer bliss for playing this game and following the community has been and still is a wonderful time of my life. I thank you. Merry Christmas to everyone!
Incredible to think that just 12 months ago, us Early Access peeps were getting to play around with Paladins for the first time (the play on the term Holy Night (Knight) really cracked me up at the time 😉).
0:09 These character designs are way too detailed to not be references
Hehe I need more shorts plus maybe more aperances of Minsic, Jaheira, Halsin, Minthara and The Dark Urge in the future
this is AWESOME, guys!!! I am deeply in love with Baldur's Gare 3 Animated Series❤❤❤❤  YOU DID GREAT!!!! Merry Christmas to the entire team! 🎄✨✨✨✨✨
This was really sweet, merry christmas folks.
This was amazing. Love seeing the cast interact with each other and the jokes of gale eating items.
What?? no bear fucking??
Haha great one!
Someone in the studio is a big fan of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, I see
They did the Paul Rudd “Look at us” meme 😂
We need animated series like this!
Karlach melting the snow xD
Karlach melting the snow made my day. Brilliant cartoon ! More of the same, please.
Stop licking the damn thing!!
This is just too good!
Guess being a warlock has its perks
How was this spoiled allredy good few four or six hours ago?
Terrific, as always ❤
Mizora 🥵🥵🥵
Gale: Don't even think about licking it...  Karlach: Say no more! *chews the cable*
I lost it when the "Initiative" rolls appear on top of their heads. Hahaha...
Lol, i love that Kharlach's first instinct was to see if the Xbox was edible
Lae'zel licking the console is what I needed today XD
Just when I think you couldn't get cooler, you do. ❤  Also Geoff!!
This was fantastic! Thank you! :D
those video are amazing!!! , i can't stop laught  this is the way to do ads!!
0:09 cast of hardcore Phandelver on the left
This is amazing lol
My PC was fried two days ago for unknown reasons. But now I know… I see what you did there, Karlach! 😂  Love this, thanks so much! ❤💋
Astarion yelling "OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE" is MY Christmas gift 😂
Shadowheart cuddling up to Karlach to keep warm, like a cat
I am sorry...but was Gale flirting with Santa? 😂❤
I hope Santa gives me something good from his bag of holding
3:07 Karlach just did it...ahahahaahaa....
I would get astarion the Knife of Hypodermus A knife that saps blood straight from its victims storing it with in the blade and hilt for some extra damage while simultaneously creating a healing potion for vampires and their spawn also if one should desire, they can use the stored blood to make the blade bleed conspicuously giving a bonus to intimidation checks
Love seeing other Dnd characters from different campaigns like World Of IO in the first 10 seconds.
Jesus, rehire the cast and make this an official TV show. I'll subscribe to whatever platform you put it on. I love you all at Larian Studios! Thank you for making gaming fun again.
Thank you larian and team for reigniting my love for video games.
This is everything I ever wanted for the holidays! XD I want to mention all the bits I loved but I’d just be describing the whole video. (But also: Tara!!!!) 💜🥰
Awesome. Will mouse and keyboard support come to the XBOX?
Karlach taking a bite out of a plugged cable is so random lmao. And I believe Gale has had enough companions licking suspicious items XD.  I also wanted to add that Wyll pointing at the glowing light in the distance is referencing that meme isn't it hahaha.
I would kill for a full blown BG3 animated series along these lines.
I need this to be a show, i need this to be a show, I need this to be a show, i need this to be a show, I need this to be a show, i need this to be a show, please Larian 🙏 😢
I wouldn't mind cuddling Karlach here lol
Between Gale eating a magic boot, Karlach metling through the snow (and chewing through the Xbox cord), and Everything Astarion....  this is a Chrismas Treat.
I love this ❤
Honestly i wouldnt mind if this was an actual cartoon, way over some gods awful live action thing.
Adorable! Larian keeps being a role model for any other team. Have the best of possible holidays, Larian! P.S. I hope, Swen recovered from losing that much blood :D
the way Karlach started melting the snow at 0:54 made me cackle for like 5 minutes lmao
Don’t even THINK about licking it 🤣 I’m dead
0:16 Geoff Peterson! #TLLS #RobotSkeleton
I absolutely love this! What a perfect comic for the release on Xbox. I've been playing it on Xbox and it's absolutely fantastic. It has a few issues I'll admit but other than that it's fantastic
Karlach looked hot in this...
Although I have never played any console game, this is really a good advertisement.
Man i would pay to watch if this were a series, love these characters.
uuuuh.  did this get reuploaded ?
give us a netflix series pleaaaaaaase !
I absolutely LOVE these. I need more, a whole series in fact. Please, I'd pay good money for it!😭💸 That aside, the references were especially hilarious in this one (also not Lae'zel *lickingthedamnthing* right after Gale tells her not to even think about it🤣).
Hey, so I was wondering... since Wyll clearly doesn't want us, maybe you could release his gift for download? In case someone else (not me) has use for it.
This was great! Also, a friend wanted me to ask where we can get some, uh, official Mizora merch. xD
Love these, would be down for a whole show in 2024....  Or live-action maybe? Please Larian, I'll give you money.
I loooooooooooooooove Astarion 😂🥰
Thank you larian for this masterpiece of gaming. I love it ❤❤
karlach melting the snow was genius.
Beautiful! Well done Larian and Mashed for making this animation.
Crowdfund a series :D
Aaaaand it's an ad :/
Ayo, Brettultimus' hardcore Lost Mines crew cameo, gotta love it. Can't say i recognize any of the others though....
Thinking of buying the game for Xbox.  I don't own a Xbox.
They seriously need to start an animated series.
I love how Geoff Keighly is a skeleton
Why is astarion feeling so cold? he is dead.
My baby girl Astarion just want a quiet night 😂 poor love is freezing to death hahaha
I love it! And I love you guys too <3
You never disappoint to make us smile larian 😂
DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT LICKING IT!
thank you larian, this shorts give me happiness in this sad week ❤
With good style, Baldurs gate could be also great TV show! or animated series. I'm very grateful for this game and experience. Merry Christmas everyone!
A miss opportunity is Astarian licking the wine like a cat as  shown in the DnD game all the voice actors played
This animated shorts are just a the best thing ever. Thank you Larian and the voice actors and everyone for sharing this masterpieces. I also love how the ending was acknowledging the fans and what they been waiting for. Larian is honestly the best company, I wish everyone a happy Christmas and Holidays.
Is that supposed to be sonic, tails, Amy and knuckles in the back right table at the tavern?😂
Please let the next cartoon feature Minthara
My dudes are an inch away from actually making an animated show
I would love to watch a full season of just more of this lol.
Game Of The Year, right here.
We seriously need a full series of this!
more More MORE
Какая же умора! Приятно когда разработчики с игроками на одной волне! Всех с наступающим! Marry Cristmas and Happy New Year!
This is all cannon btw
Larian Larian Oh Merry Christmas Larian!
don't lick it XD
Astarion's disappointment at 0:35 had my sides hurting from laughter. These are AMAZING.
I like seeing sonic gang there
“Don’t even think about licking it”  Lmao
Seeing Lae'zel's eyes sparkle with joy is one of the best moments of this entire short XD
Very nice work 😸
I fuckin love you guys lol
These animations are everything one could wish for! Please don't stop best christmas gift ever. Change my mind <3  Happy Holidays everyone!
2 things about Astarion that I noticed from other's comments  1. He's basically a walking corpse, so he couldn't warm himself, poor thing 2. When he was checking himself in the mirror... He doesn't have a reflection, so its a floating coat in the mirror lol
I love it... XBOX sucks though!
Was that a Geoff Peterson reference?
Karlach is a walking oven ❤️‍🔥
Shadowheart clinging to Karlach and Geoff getting Lae’zel a gift 😂😂😂😂
Karlach is Best Girl.
This is an ultimate epic, I mean it! Sceptical unity of Lae'zel and Astarion while the rest of the party loses their minds is priceless 🤣 not to mention other subtle details
now all we need is bg3 on the nintendo switch! keep the animated shorts coming! better yet cant we get an animated series like vox machina of these guys?
And what does TAV have to say about all this!?
OKAY NOW MAKE ONE W JAHEIRA HALSIN MINTHARA AND MINSC
Another absolutely amazing animation to compliment the absolutely amazing Game of The Year 😍
thank you  for the game.
I still need... a bit more context on what happened-?
Almost Everone in the party: struggling through the cold wind and snow. Karlach; just walking through it. Also bonus for being a warm Mama-K for Shadowheart and Astarion.
What a perfect Christmas present! Thank you Larian and the VAs for continuing to feed us.  For some reason Karlach chomping on the power cable made me burst out laughing.
Mizora XXX....sounds like a DLC to me!
3:07 that face always gets me :D
For the love of god, this needs to be a show. I would watch the shit out of it. Gale the level headed leader of the group that has to constantly deal with his party and their shenanigans. Wyll, the overly dramatic hero with a sugar mommy. Lae'zel, the stoic no nonsense outsider that constantly confuses others customs. Shadowheart, the broody edgelord always looking for Shar-senpai's attention. Karlach, the party mama full of fun and mishaps. And of course, Astarion, the fabulous team diva always looking for his next thrill. Maybe even some cameos from Dark Urge the white dragonborn sorcerer that tries way to hard to be an important murderhobo. Halsin being a fish out of water type. Minthara dominating weaklings in her sadistic fashion. Jaheria wondering how she will manage to survive another group of weirdos for a third time, and Minsc doing what Minsc does best kicking butts for goodness. This show would be a slam dunk
This is awesome, thank you Larian team and all cast and Mashed, you're all amazing, we need more puhleeeaaseeee
we need a series !!
Ooh my this the best trailer release ever 😊 and now Xbox can play
Thank you Larian for the many years of happiness!
I LOVE the detail of Karlach melting through the snow. And the animation is amazing!
Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooore. Please?
2:41 Lae'zel is so adorable here. This is the nicest I've ever seen her lmao
3:07 when the "Karlac" chewed on the cable i just shouted "oh dear god what the fresh hell!" and then boom! yeap Karlac has the personaity of a demon kitty XD anyone who has had a cat in there life or has a cat knows this very issue all too well!  2:54 thoust art not touch the blackist box for ye not knowith what evils thoust be unleashing! one but does wonder if this is the sarcophagus of the human known only as "Bill of the Gate" - Withers
Gale playing with Tara-! 😭 💕
thanks larian
now Shadowheart can play BG3 with me 😭😭❤️❤️
Dark urge needs to be in this lmfao silent protagonist
Karlach biting the card made me cackle.
This is amazing :D but I have one puzzling question, How did some French lets player post this video on their channel 14 hours before you guys??
Oh my god i love this 😍😂😂
Thanks guys! You're the godsdamn best 🎉
on 1:54 best part 😋
please, make this a series! we would LOVE to see a full animation with our favorite characters! 💖💖💖💖💖
Fucking Hell larian studios I love this! You are truly a studio for all sorts of gamers from casual to hardcore's You may not make a lot of games of all genres But the ones you do make are great! I hope you continue to be a shining Beacon to all gamers and I wish you a very merry Christmas!
Карлах и астарион, ржу в голос🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Don't even think about licking it" I love when they know and embrace what their fandom enjoys.
0:43 nice Soyjak
Is Geoff a character from something in game I haven’t discovered yet?
More!
"Don't even THINK about licking it.." (3:00)  Thank you Larian Studios, as well as the entire Baldur's Gate 3 team and fandom, for creating one of the best games and communities I've experienced in a very long time.
Hold on a minute... is that Tails, Sonic, Amy and Knuckles as an adventuring party at the start?!
This is amazing😂hilarius
The initiative rolls and everyone's expressions had me laughing.  Most were dead serious and raring to throw down, Karlach's eyes were ablaze, and meanwhile Astarion looked so...enthusiastic.
"come to ... DADDY"  Larian making Karlach the ultimate Daddy canon. Gotta love it.
"Don't even THINK about licking it...." YES!!!
Holy shit it's the IOverse characters, good old tommy the goblin slayer
ngl I'd love to get a gift from mizora like that
karlach always deserves better.... and larian provides
i love how after gale tells lae’zel not to lick the box, you can vaguely hear licking sounds in the background a couple seconds later😂
Hear me out bring tomato in to do either a background NPC or a player voice
And this is exactly why we love the people of Larian so much <3
1:41 AYO?!
i absolutely love this omg
Can't wait to spend Christmas watching my partner swoon over Astarion.  At least I have the bundle of joy that is Karlach.
Astarion sitting on Karlach’s lap for warmth.💕✨ Poor bugger has No blood flow. 🥶
Netflix series wen
We 1000% need more of this pleaseeee!
gale is the beta gale?!?!?1
So it obviously was Red Wizards of Thay
"Don't even think about licking it."  Gale has some spider flashbacks lol
Thank you Larian Studios, for bringing hope for a better future where gamers aren't exploited for profits, but instead presented good stories and epic gameplay <3 We need people like you now, more than ever.
I adore 2d animation!❤
Карлах прекрасна =) спасибо вам вы последняя надежда геймдева) Уважаемые Лариан сделайте следующую "Вампиры маскарад" и "Дискиплс" только вы сможете ; )
This is amazing 😂😂😂
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone at Larian and all those who worked on the GOTY!  Best game I've ever had the fortune of playing, and one that has meant so much to so many ❤
The monolith.
I genuinely thought that they would embrace the bag exploit of traders here
Lae’zel and her pickled mindflayer head brings me so much joy
Espectacular. 🥰
wow this is unexpected
Как же приятно видеть полюбившихся героев в этих коротких анимашках))) Спасибо, Лариан!
None of us can blame Wyll
God I LOVE all the amazing details in this short!   Kalrach melting the ice was HILARIOUS, you guys need to make this a regular series or something i'd love to see the Adventures of the Baldur's Gate 3 cast.
Thank you Larian for this amazing game🤩.. hope to see new fixes and patches or new expansions added to game
Please make this into a Netflix series
That boot have seen everything...
There was so much in so little time, absolutely incredible guys.
You all are the best!
love these video so much
gale telling lae'zel not to lick the xbox - he still hasn't recovered from tav's spider incident 😭
Joy. That's what Larian gave so many of us this year.  And with that joy and whole hunk of laughter.  The whole Karlach in the snow bit. Aces, folks. Absolute aces.  And an officially official welcome to the XBox contingent.   Thank you, Larian. (And I mean every single person that was involved!)
Game of the century. Thanks Larian.
I would rather love to see more of these animated shorts than a live action done by Netflix
Baldur's Gate III - The gift that keeps on giving (updates, replayability). Thank you, Larian! Happy holidays to you. :)
0:36 I’m so glad I watched this before I showed my kids. But it is hilarious. Merry Christmas!
WYLL'S GIFT I'M SCREAMING 😱😱😭😭
I love that Karlach always melts the snow. Good on them to keep details like that  in mind
There's something about Astarion saying for fucks sake that's really funny to me😄
I’m hopefully getting a series x for Christmas and I will only play gate 3 for the next month
Astarion is really funny XDDDD
Happy Holidays Larian!
Hey Wyll, you sure you want that? Its probably cursed or something. Let me take a look
Astarion bitterly sitting on Karlach's lap to keep himself warm fucking sent me
This was PERFECT!! Thank you Larian for making not only the GOTY, but the best game I've ever played! 5 playthroughs in 4 months and still can't put it down. I hope you can include Minthara, Minsc or Jaheira in the next ones! Have a merry Christmas and fantastic New Year! 🥰
XD
Classic Astarion, busy stroking his c- uhh... ego.
That's cool and all, but WHY IS THERE A CERTAIN SCENE WHERE EVERYTHING GOES DARK DESPITE ME HAVING DARKVISION?! FIX THAT!
2:59  Gale: Don't even Think about licking it  Lazael: >:)  Gale: Stop that. (not this again)
I love how despites Gale's comment, you can hear Lae'zel licking the Xbox in the background haha.  I really want a mini series by Larian now.
Is that skeleton a sneaky Craig Ferguson reference or did I miss something?
Karlach melting the snow, lol.
Love these characters
This is fucking great
For anyone playing this game for the first time on Xbox, lucky you! I'm jealous that you get to experience the game for the first time. I wish I could experience the game for the first time again as a new player! I hope you enjoy your first playthrough!
Another sweet sale for Popper..a BUSINESS LORD!
God I love these animated shorts. Keep them coming Larian love you guys. Happy hollidays
Karlach smelting through the snow was a funny detail.
simply amazing, hats off to you larian
I hope everyone has a great Baldurian Christmas!
Can we get a season or more of this on Netflix?
Please, we need a animation series like this!!!!
Karlach melting the snow while hiding 🥰
Awesome. Thank you Larian. Two playthroughs in and still yet to beat the game. Am loving it though.  Also, I would totally watch a series of bg3 inspired cartoons.
Merry Christmas everyone, wish you all a very chaotic session to your next DND adventure
X Box friends, the time has finally come, enjoy your journey and Merry Christmas everyone
Absolutely love this! 😂
I love Karlach sinking into the snow constantly..lol
that was awesome thanks for making such an amazing game and I hope you all have a happy holiday
This is so good. Thank you ALL for Baldur's Gate 3 and these fun cartoons!!! :D
I could easily watch so many seasons of this show ❤❤❤ I absolutely love the characters and the cast ❤️ thanks for everything, Larian 🤗 and I wish Mr Vincke, all the actors and to all the team a very happy holidays 💜🎁
Seeing Tomato’s, Juniper’s, Joefudge’s and CrownDM’s characters at the beginning was nice surprise :)
Awesome. Thank you.  Merry Christmas to the Larian team,  fans and all those who passionately love BG3.
라리안 또 당신입니까?? DLC 기대합니다
Happy holidays guys❤
Велико
Larian keeps hitting homeruns
"My gods, I'm beautiful~"   Yes, yes you are Astarion. You are a gift. 💝
I love how you guys are embracing the boot eating memes
Thank you Larian, for being the best game developer on the market! Your passion, commitment, and humanity shines through your work! ❤
Give me more animated shorts of the party going on more dumb and fun adventures.
Happy holidays!
