- what garbage! - what do you expect, they're not canadians!
Dave Filoni doesn't know how to write wisdom (as he knows nothing about wisdom) so, instead of having something to say he just has Ahsoka standing stoically and smirking. He is a very ignorant man. For Filoni smirking is the same as knowing (which is handy as Filoni himself doesn't know anything and so can't write about it).
I stopped after the second episode but from what I saw in the trailer, the one good thing I can say in this show's favor is that the actress who plays Sabine looks really pretty with that short haircut! The show was still meh, though. I did like the Obi Wan show despite popular consensus not being too positive so maybe I'll give Ahsoka another shot over the upcoming winter.  Egg nog with a shot of Puerto Rican rum always lifts the mood.
This is one of those episodes where I’m gunna watch this and not the actual show
Disney is utter trash.
0:00-6:13 WHAT??? and by the way my English is impeccable!!!
Ahsoka = Gandalf
No one gonna talk about the reckless child endangerment on the General lady's part?
They ruined Thrawn. 😭😭😭
This is what happens when you think very, very young girls can write scripts.
Wait. Did he say "space whales"?
Every single yt video I've seen talking about new star wars shows makes me glad I didn't waste my time or money watching them.
Such a dumb show!
Jedi porn for angry lesbians?! STFU and take my money, patriarchs!
So in order to save Ezra Sabine kills Bilions,and she is good
What a trash show
Andor having no pitch meeting and memes means that it's a well written show.
tibia ... shin 😂
That explosion in the first episode was a Defoliator. Its shockwave would only destroy organic matter. Perhaps the vicinity around droids (such as the droids themselves) would explode normally, but beyond that, objects would remain intact. Perhaps those droids did survive and is why Ahsoka thought two droids instead of three to be suspicious in the next episode.
I mean, it was a shit story...but this REALLY boils it down. Way to ruin Ahsoka AND Rebels, Disney...
Ashoka did a Gandalf. 😂
good god starwars is in a bad place
1:05 Not to mention, they basically borrowed the concept from their animated movie, Treasure Planet. Same deal, ball that you turn into a certain configuration to reveal a star map.
Great more strong females 😂😂😂😂
2:02 It's so they can have an easier shot against her. If they stay away from Ahsoka, she will just deflect all of their fire back at them, but if they're up close it will give her less time to react.
obi-wan has the best beard in the galaxy.
I don't like it I liked ahsoka before all of this!
The Tibia Lady? The Shin Lady? LOL
This is my OC Sabine Wren. - Oh like the Knights of Ren from the sequels? No relation at all. She's a super cool Mandalorian. - So she's got the stoic honor thing going on? No, she's a free-spirited graffiti artist teenager. - Well, I guess being so young, she's been kind of sheltered from the more violent side of things. No, she's got a dark history working as a shady bounty hunter. -When did she do that? I thought she was just a teenager. She took up bounty hunting after dropping out of the Imperial Academy.  -She was at the academy before her career as a bounty hunter before the start of Rebels! How? Obviously she's a genius. As a child she developed a weapon to selectively target beskar armour and fry the people inside. - What? So now that Ezra's missing she needs to become the new Jedi for the show. - Wait... she's force sensitive too? Since when? Since the time skip. We showed her actively struggling with lightsaber training, since she wasn't force sensitive, having to rely on Mando combat techniques to compensate. But now she's a Jedi too!
Didn't see this show but they really did.... it you only had to watch one cartoon to see how she held her sabers how they get that and her personality so wrong smh
I'll be completely honest.... the Anakin episode alone made the entire  series worth it. Egregious issues aside
This whole show is basically "white people bad unless you're leftist coded white with goofy hair".
Montgomery Burns   000-00-0002
Grey Jedi becomes Ahsoka the White…. Gandalf not impressed 😅
The one thing consistent in Star Wars series is how bad the Storm Troopers are at aiming and firing.
To be fair a lot of the lore and payoff of the show is more powerful if you watched Rebels, which I feel like I lot of people didn’t do going into this series. Like the whale thing was established in the show and the whole reason why they’re banished in the first place. Sabine’s reunion with Ezra was as chill and nonchalant as their relationship on Rebels. On the flip side, Sabine risking all the Galaxy to reunite with Ezra did feel very out of character, especially as like I said their relationship was more of a “will they won’t they” kind of dynamic. All and all I’m glad I watched Rebels before this because i feel like if I didn’t I would be so lost and wouldn’t care for Sabine and Hera and Thrawn like I did
you know for all the gaffs i liked Ahsoka for what it was. The only thing that really upset me was how unseriously Sabine took trying to use the force and how Ahsoka taught her. Sabine doesn't do any meditation, no introspection, and Ahsoka doesn't speak about the force like Obi-wan or Yoda. It may have been more believable that Sabine finally gets force powers if she seemed to care and work harder on it.
Say what you want about this show, but it always amazes me that Disney consistently cast actors that quite literally look NOTHING like their animated counterparts. Like I get it, it's animated, but the actress who voiced the original Ahsoka actually looked like the character! And I've seen dozens of people cosplaying the characters from all the different sw animated shows and looking a thousand times better than the constant frog-faced people they find to do this live action bs. How!?
"let's get a 45 year old lady to play a girl in her 20's"
After the meeting, Producer Guy goes for Ahsoka but not before he hits Ah-sauna for Ah-Steamha😂
HAAAaaahhhh ........ Y'know.... you'd think that after all these [stupid looooong] deng years that 'super easy, barely an inconvenience' would have worn thin --- or lost its lustre --- or whatevs --- by now.. And yet [somehow], it's *still* frickin' funny & *still* flipperlin' gets me .. EVERY .. DENG .. EFFING .. TIME....... [*every* deng effing time] ... X-D ............awesome [-=
Ahsoka is actually the character that made me realize how stupid Star Wars actually is.
This Ahsoka Tano is not the Ahsoka Tano you are looking for. If you want to understand how awesome she actually is, watch the entirety of Clone Wars. Once you have done that, come back and watch this shit show to understand how bad this show really is.
I have always wondered why Stormtroopers even bother wearing armor. Doesn't seem to work like it should.
Honestly very on character for Ezra not to take off his disguise until the last moment for dramatic effect
I entirely forgot this existed!
I forgot how bad this show was
Ahsoka, Sabine, and Thrawn sound drastically out of character based on this description. (And Sabine was never force sensitive.)
I haven't even seen this and I HATE what they've done with Thrawn. I LOVE Timothy Zahn (author who created Thrawn and made him epic), apparently he was again fantastic in Rebels, and now they had to make him incompetent so he didn't utterly humiliate that gathering of garbage (which he would have).
Stopping a fart is tight 😂
Giving Sabine jedi powers was such an annoying move. Also getting tired of everyone getting back up from saber stabs.
"tickled by a lightsaber" lmao I love it
Bad guys love having secret maps that lead to them 😂
“…this guy Baylan, who has Jedi powers and the best beard in the galaxy.”  Obi-Wan Stans: “So uncivilized.”
Do pitch meeting for Andor
Did Ryan record screen writer guy then get a haircut then record producer guy?
You know it's so baffling to me that for some reason most of the writers of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka are basically just copying JJ Abrams favourite tropes with side quests and maps that he used in The Force Awakens and The Rise Of Skywalker almost as if they were too stupid to be original and just decided to copy the sequel trilogy with no acknowledgement of the fact that people didn't like those tropes
Who is this Tibia person who attacked her? Shin
Kinda glad I stopped watching starwars after the clone wars series
Zombie Stormtroopers: Imagine having to kill Stormtroopers...twice.
Dude, so funny, giving you a like is going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience....
and then Shin and Sabine don't even kiss :/
The show was so garbage that I watched the entire thing and I couldn’t remember any of it, watching this video was like re-watching the whole show
McCready has the best beard in the galaxy.
Tibia actually works for a starwarsy character name
Hahahah you completely ruined it for me but I was so freaking funny😂😂😂
This is one of my favorites 😂. I watched the show, and it was alright. It made infinitely more sense because I watched Star Wars rebels. It’s essentially season 5
Love how Producer Guy looks slightly offended that Writer Guy described Balin’s beard as the best in the galaxy. 😅
To understand this show better you need to watch rebels and they totally didn’t market that as part of the show 🤦🏻‍♂️.
4:26……in her defense she saw an opportunity for revenge and let it consume her for a moment and then realized her true goal …..I can dig that
what a ridickless force-is-female show.
I am certain that one day Ryan will open these with  Producer Guy: So you have a new idea for me? Writer Guy: No Sir, I don't. So anyway *explains new Disney/Marvel ip hes pitching*
These new shows and movies seem to be made by people with serious cognitive disabilities xD
3:25 Elon?
Ahsoka.. I'm not Mormon~
‘Who is this Tibia person?’ ‘Shin’  Is the most underrated joke here. People who do running or gym will know
This really looks like its just one giant DEI pandering circle jerk fest.
It was nice of you to leave out the fact most of the run time was just characters walking in straight lines to locations that were always far to far away for some reason and pointlessly to then typically turn around and walk back. LOL
Still believe making Sabine force sensitive was a huge mistake.  She was a powerful fighter in her own right.
Also, suddenly really distracting that live action Thrawn looks distressingly like Elon Musk.
Omg the shin and Tibia joke hit me so hard!!! Came out of nowhere too!  You always makes my day better ryan. Thanks!
Sounds like this whole show is people not having to face consequences for the genocides they caused because they’re “the good guys”… like Sabine is the most selfish character ever but why does Anakin get to hang out as a force ghost in the afterlife just cause he stopped his boss from killing his son before dying, shouldn’t he face some sort of penance for the literal planets he chose to annihilate?
I feel like Ahsoka was purely for Clone Wars (show) and Star Wars Rebels fans
I'm really tired of the Filoni-verse
I love how he left in his crackup when he mentioned about Ashoka getting in space and fighting the fighters with her lightsaber.
I just watched this show with my mom and it broke our brains. And my mom loves bad star wars content like the disney sequels. But ahsoka broke her. We are now using Sabine as an term to describe annoying characters who fuck up everything by making stupid choices. Like sacrificing an entire galaxy to save one dude or getting the map captured in the first place. it kinda felt like s8 of game of thrones. The protagonists came so far and worked so hard and yet in the end it was all for nothing and the characters made just the worst decisions and were somehow super proud of themselves at the end despite the terrible shit that was unleashed and is still to come. Like ahsoka being so proud of Sabine for dooming the galaxy to save ezra gave me the same vibes as tyrion saying bran had the best story and that should make him king. I know theyre very much not comparable but it was the same exhuastion and sense of defeat a bad ending of any show gives you, but its even worse when everything is terrible yet the characters are proud of themselves ans full of hope somehow.
Some days I do think back on what could have been for star wars.. then I see another new thing being pimped out and move on.
He does have the best beard. A good character as well.
He there her in the drinking stuff.
i really wish they would have both looked over to a fire exit map sign that said you are here and writer guy got suspicious when he said the bad guys and maps bit
Behold, I am not Ahsoka the Grey, whom you betrayed. I am Ahsoka the White, who has returned from death.
Qui-Gonn would object to how harmless lightsaber-impaling is, but...  he' quite gone.
Qui-Gon getting stabbed in the stomach with a lightsaber: dies  Every good guy since then getting stabbed in the stomach with a lightsaber: survives  Qui-Gon's Force ghost: What the heck, guys?!
And somehow Ahsoka was nowhere near the worst Disney show these last years
Wait, how many Sith are there in this show?  We just threw away the whole "Always two, there are, no more, no less" thing? Cause this is during prime Palpatine/Vader timeline, right?  So we have evil Force users who are not Sith?  Why am I even asking these questions? I care absolutely nothing about the Disney Star Wars universe.
I think it's the first time I notice you changing hairstyles between personas
The whole Disney Star Wars has been going down hill from infinite plot holes.
2:32 Wait...is Ahsoka Gandalf? Ooooooh being Star Wars Gandalf is...actually kind of lame.
Watching the Pitch Meeting and not watching the TV-show is TIGHT.
Glad I didn't waste my time watching this series.
the further I get from when this show came out the more I realize how badly it massacred my willingness to continue with Star Wars. This was it, this was the last straw, and I didn’t even realize it when I watched it because it was so *boringly* bad. Like, I *love* these characters from the animated shows, they were the only ones I cared about anymore, and then this show managed to ruin them badly enough that I no longer care.   Congratulations.
I really enjoyed the animated series with Ahsoka, so was looking forward to the live-action adaptation....stopped watching it after two episodes I was so angry.
Nope. Didn't even make it through this. What a piece of garbage.
they really pulled the Gandalf change... OMW Im glad i didnt watch this show
"impaled by a Lightsaber is Not bad" thats says plenty of this show
me not waiting for the, "super easy, barely an inconvenience" lol
@1:56 I get that lightsabers can diflect blasters and all, but is momentum and inertia not a thing in Star Wars? Shouldn't she go flying off into space? What am I saying? There's fires in space now. 🤦
As a big fan of Ahsoka, Rebels, and Star Wars in general I can totally overlook all these flaws because they gave me a live action Ahsoka with an adult Sabine, Ezra and Thrawn.  The video was funny though.
Why are these guys not invited to a pre showing of every film before it goes to public..?😊
Orders like the robots had are pretty common. Secure an item, and if you can't secure it, destroy it
Tickled by a lightsaber
My best friend finally talked me into watching this show, and I really lost respect for his tastes more and more with every episode. It's often beautiful, but so very empty. Ahsoka with her damn smirk like she's seeing the deeper truth in something... usually right after making a huge mistake. And almost always those mistakes are purely for plot convenience, not because any sane person would do it. I absolutely lost it when she said something to the effect of "It'll only slow us down if we let it." Bitch, you were going literally hermit-crab-speed when you had access to a spacefaring vessel, and now you've lost the spacefaring vessel protecting the hermit crabs who were only in danger because you were with them. You've already let yourself be slow when you had the fastest transportation known to man. But of course, the very next scene, they managed to get there in no time by riding the rat-dogs. Apparently, they're faster than spaceships. Or maybe there was absolutely no purpose to walking with the crab convoy in the first place. You sacrificed your ship for nothing. For that matter, how did the ship go down in 2 hits from TIE fighters? It's survived way more than that in past scenes, just within this show. But now the plot needs it to be out of commission, so...
They should of just finished Star Wars Rebels instead of making this god awful show
That's literally just the map from Treasure Planet  Like literally exactly the same
Due not dog
Dog for a big plopping!😂😂😂
"Tibia?" "Shin.." 1:23 clever lol
I’ve been called some very mean names by people who liked this version of Sabine.  The tried to tell me I don’t love my family if I wouldn’t risk the safety of the galaxy to save a family member. Worse things than that as well but I shouldn’t repeat those
I kinda expected more jokes about how you pretty much need to watch two Animated shows with over 200 episodes total to even know who any of these characters are
"plugging a fart is tight" fixed it for you
This is my name and my social security number is three   You can't tell me what to do
I mean, Thrawn was cool, I guess...Yeah, other than Thrawn, Baylan, and some nice fight-scenes, this show was a bit of a let-down.
Oh when he says "fights" he's trying so hard not to laugh, hahaha
This 6 minute clip had more logic, talent, plot development and great writing than this entire Star Wars series.
It's a continuation of Rebels. That's the content you asked for
Ahsoka > andor
Shin to tibia to best beard in the galaxy  That's what I'm here for
This is the best way to consumer this output. If you can't ignore it totally.
Producer Guy and Writer guy are always loyal to the Rule of Two
Biggest pet peeve for me is how Ashoka never told Sabine how people were after the map and that's why she didn't want her to take out of her ship. She really couldn't bother to tell Sabine they were in possible danger and be careful
It’s like this show was written by a 9 year old girl…
1:37 😂
Anyone who watched the show did so only to 🥒💦  to face fleshNoodle girl's 🍑.   Go on. Tell me I'm incorrect.
4:22 Okay to be fair, she didn't actually *decide* to land next to Baylan. Baylan saw her ship as it was coming in and intercepted her. And the reason she didn't just land in the middle of the fight is because Huyang refused to do so because it was against mission protocol.
I had something witty, but Phuck fans, if .001% complain they gotta phuck it up. Guess making stuff for 99.2% isn't enough i am going back to Star Trek
"tickled by a light saber" thats hilariously accurate even though it burns at 1000³K and is hot enough to melt metals, burn through bulk head doors and can LITERALLY CUT PEOPLE IN HALF ... as long as your stabbed by it your completely fine ... 100% makes perfect sense.
2:03  because it looks cool.   " That  works "
Pangalactic transdimensional space whales are TIGHT!
6:03 I wouldn't even describe this as content. More like Dis+ content.   Which is exactly how I feel about fat Thrawn.
I know its bad when I forgot i didn't watch it
"For a swim?" "For a death!"  I love it.
and of course don't forget that this show undoes pretty much all the character development everyone had during Rebels  (:
"Tickled by a lifesaber" lol
As bad as this show was, Obi Wan was worse, not to mention the twin travesty Acolyte. Disney, so much fodder for ridicule…
If the show’s only half as bad as this sounds, than it must be brutal.   Well done!
Having not watched this, the script actually sounds so stupid it should be a parody on Star Wars.
"he'll bring war and genocide to the galaxy."   sir you do know this is star wars?
I love how the world between worlds was set up in Rebels as this place that one can only enter through a specialized gateway that can only be opened through the Force…yet in this show, Ahsoka enters it after falling into a bottomless pit and a coma.   It’s like Filoni was like “Oh right, this thing from the other show exists, and we need CGI Hayden Christensen in this to beat the Spider-Man: No Way Home horse corpse. These fans eat up everything I do!”
Wow, they used the map from treasure planet.
What a sorry excuse of a Star Wars show.
Nah, this one doesn’t hold as much shows that bombs. Couple funny marks tho. Darth Vader survived lots of stuff and is on a respirator, Sabine got one poke in the side.
Joe Biden did the same thing for Britney Griner!
Sad part is that in Star wars Clone wars shes one of the best characters. Basically turns into what Jedi should have been from the start.  This show just ruins all of it.
Diabolical. I loved it. Amazing summary. I hope you haven't been threatened by any of the hard-core lovers of the show  some of whom may have actually watched all of it.
"Best beard in the Galaxy..."  "What?" hahahaha
You gotta love how Jedi are simultaneously the most well known group of super-powered people in the Star Wars universe, yet everyone has zero understanding of their practical abilities. I mean come on. If you're gonna fight someone with a melee weapon, at least keep your distance. Also, try explosive weapons?
“Now that Sabine has recovered from being tickled by a lightsaber…” 😂😂💀💀
@ 02:13  ".......stopping a fart is tight......"
Stormtroopers are bad but, Zombie Stormtroopers are worst! 🤟🏻💀
oh no, i just realized that Ahsoka first season is just like the meme Big bang theory had about Raiders of the lost Ark. Ahsoka is not important to the flow of events. Nooooooo! Without Aksoka, Thrawn would have still made it back. damn it.
1 year old since it premiered!  One of my favorite spin-offs  I really like Rosario Dawson But I wish more of her was the center of this  They did do a better job with the flashbacks than in Clone Wars (2008) I’m happy they brought back Hayden Christensen too
Qui Gon must be really mad that everyone keeps surviving light saber stabs so easily now.
Don't worry, I'm sure they will TOTALLY REDEEM themselves with the acolyte. I mean, you couldn't possibly make two woke feminist stinkers in a row, right?
I love how lightsabres can deflect blaster shots. But no one ever just makes a big ol' shield using the same tech.
He makes me hate every movie every time I watch him
Thanks for doing this one. That show was so boring I couldn't actually force myself to sit through it.
South Park said it right. "Put another gay, diverse woman in it and make it laaaaaaaaaaaame"
I will never forgive Disney for ruining one of my favorite Star Wars charaters.
Kind of a little odd that, in a show built entirely off of nostalgia characters like the cast of Rebels, Ahsoka herself, and even Anakin Skywalker, it's C-3PO that's called the "nostalgia cameo" by virtue of I guess being the nostalgiest?
As someone who enjoyed Rebels, I actually had a good time with this series. It's not perfect, but I've been so used to getting Boba Fett and Obi-Wan type shows that getting something that was decent made me happy. Plus, it was nice to see them bring Ezra and Thrawn to live action AND keep them consistent with their animated counterparts, including using Thrawn's VA as the live-action actor as well.
1:38 - "Tickled by a lightsaber." 😂😂😂
pause at 4:06
Watching Pitch Meeting instead of literally any Disney content is tight!
Star Wars is long dead and buried
Somebody needs to show all these Pitch Meetings to the people who have been writing these awful shows.
Content for the sake of content...that sums up a good chunk of Star Wars product.
the real pitch meeting involved Filoni coming into the office dropping trousers and taking a shit on the table...everyone applauded
These videos are so good. And really highlight how stupid the plots are with these recent shows.
Only when I watch your videos do I wish I could super like something. I keep rewinding to watch parts over and over again.
Nothing about this show was Tight.
How dare they do this to my boy Thrawn. I love the new Thrawn book series by Timothy Zahn. Filoni completely missed the mark on this.
Am I the only one that thinks when she's fighting in space they stole Puss in Boots cartwheel fighting style? 😸
Producer: "Whats the defining characteristic of Ashoka?" Writer: "She is extremely agile and nimble, her fighting style is all jumps and graceful dancing like moves, maybe the quickest jedi we have ever seen" Producer: "Ok, so ill cast someone for the role that can barely move, someone  that looks like a 80 years old lady that just had hip replacement surgery"
"I usually bathe alone." It really amazes me how much backstory, character development, and great dialogue they develop once you watch about a hundred of these meetings. Please get off my back for saying "they."
The Asokhalyte seems ... 🤔 ... a tv series?  Not the *TRON* I remember. 😴
also the actor that plays ahsoka cannot act.  that face she makes it annoying.
Lol, I remember thinking when Sabine and Ezra met up it was the most anticlimactic shit ever. Actually the most dissapointing star wars show
Dang. What an easy way to destroy the show. The fact he said they got tickled by a lightsaber was hilarious
You went easy on Sabine's writing... Ahsoka training her after denying Grogu for attachment was so dumb
It is a special Gift ! 😄
e
Ahh yes ahsoka.. who fans think is more powerful than Mara Jade and Jaina.
Who writes these scripts at Disney? smh
This seems even worse than I suspected. I'm glad I didn't watch it.   Incredible that they got the actual voice actor for Thrawn but did absolutely nothing with him.
Feloni really is a hack isn't he?
Lol, some of this is being summarized as if there aren't 4 previous seasons though, to be fair. Ahsoka is just Rebels season 5.
"For a swim?" "For a death!" "Oh no!" ^^
I thought this was American Horror Story OKA
tight tight tight
BUT WHERE IS ANAKIN
I was hoping Producer guy would bring up that Ahsoka is basically Rebels Season 5
Space whales is where Disney Star Wars jumped the shark.
Really? Zombies? 🤦‍♀️
Right... now do the acolyte, cause that is gonna be a TRIP!
We need the Acolyte
"turning it a certain way", that way being so the marks on it make the same pattern in the floor of the room where it was found. Or so i heard, i dunno, i didn't watch this crap.
I find it hilarious that most people saw Ahsoka as black instead of Indian, which is basically what her name and hairstyle reference.  Even her animated version in Clone Wars looked more Indian to me.  Not much cultural awareness from either Disney or its audience.
They didnt mentioned that the one playing Hera is also no charm at all, and kept smirking around 🤦‍♂️
Star Bore
Super sokah
With the advent of the Acolyte, Ashoka now looks like story-telling genius.
My social security number is 1...  2...  3...  4...  5.
I swear one day we are going to find out that these star wars movies were written by AI the entire time. This series used to be pretty polished and now it feels hollow like someone pretending to be the cool guy they were in high school but getting it all wrong
Ashoka was a terribly bad show.
Can’t wait for the acolyte one as I really don’t want to have to watch the actual show!
cant wait Acolyte pitch meeting
Lightsabers just aren't what they use to be.
I CANNOT WAIT to see pitch meeting guy and producer guy go head to head over The Acolyte soon. That’s gonna be wow, wow, wow………wow.
The hashtag makes her look like a crustacean
Sabine, Ezra, Morgan...seems like Disney got a bit lazy with the characters' names...
Nailed it. Absolutely nailed it!
That is not the map to Thrawn, that's the map to Treasure Planet.
They wrote Ashoka like a damn cameo in her own show. You should be able to recognize snips in this adaptation.
Can't wait for you to rip Acolyte to shreds 😂😂😂
“The pioneers used to ride these baby’s for miles”– Ahsoka when she saw the whale
"but she chose to drop off there" 😂
Can’t wait for the Acolyte
So you have a live-action sequel to a divisive Disney XD cartoon nobody ever watched which incorporated a character from a 1992 book for me? Yes sir I do!
I really can’t wait for the Acolyte Pitch Meeting!
The "you won't die from light saber wound" Will be perfect for acolyte pitch meeting
Disney tasteless slop for the masses, the McDonalds of entertainment
Watching Ashoka deflect starship lasers… (which are the same size as blaster shots?)  It won’t be long before Disney has a Jedi deflecting a Death Star laser in a classic HP style screaming match  And when I say Death Star, I mean STAR  First 2 are moons. Then Disney makes the Death Planet, the next logical step of course is the Death Sun. It will probably blow up galaxies
Why does every lead female action character since 2016 absolutely suck?!
Tickled by a light saber 😂😂😂
Once they start with stabbings in the stomach weren’t fatal I lost the rest of my desire for Star Wars.
So many plot holes so cleverly pointed out.
I started watching this pitch video, and then remembered that I hadn’t watched the actual show.
This just looks sooooo bad...thankfully I just watched the pitch meeting...
The best beard in the galaxy. R.I.P. Ray Stevenson.
When do we get "Super Easy. Barely an Inconvenience" tee shirts or mugs?
I’m still waiting for the Andor Pitch Meeting
A long long time ago in a couple of galaxies far far away…
The More of these. I watch, the less. I think there are pitch meetings that occur.
So...we're just not gonna talk about Producer-Guy's haircut?
"So who's this Tibia person that attacked her?" "Shin" "What did I say?"  Oh Ryan.. never change.
This does such a great job shredding the show and is actually the first time I heard Ryan outright laugh at the absurdity of a scene.  Glad he didn't cut it out.  The jumping around in space while slashing at enemy fighters was so bad.  The writers are total idiots.
“After she was tickled with a lightsaber” 😂😂😂
The map sounds suspiciously like they copied the idea from Treasure Planet
I like how when he described the space battle he could not hold back his laughter because of how batshit insane that is.
Oh destroying beloved cinematic franchises are tighttt
Girl Power!
Girk power requires more talent to write than a tumbler level fab fic
What a mess. A sad waste of characters and resources.
I love how lightsabers cutting capacities can shift from killing someone with one stab, them not killing, them it has trouble to cut a metal door and suddenly it rips off a ships wing in the space like butter
Wow. Ive never seen Ahsoka but sure does sound like a whole bunch of awful.
I hope Disney is watching this. How anyone can actually say this show is good.
This show is so dumb, I can't even finish watching Ryan make fun of it.
Thanks Ryan for reminding me why I don’t really need to shell out money for Disney+, it’s saved me a ton of money and more importantly time!
Movies are so, so, stupid.
I like to imagine this is Dave Filoni and Kathleen Kennedy. 😂
Ashoka was a good show.
"Why wouldn't the bad guys just stay slightly far away from their disabled ship and fire at them instead of swooping in a lightsabre lady?"  I feel they missed a "Hay, I'm going to need you to get all up off my back?"
1:31 rest in peace, oh great Ray Stevenson. 😭
Soooo… since when does producer guy have a different hair cut to screen writer guy, I am starting to suspect there are two Ryans now after all. Up until now, I thought it was just trickery in editing, but now we know you have a twin.
They really went ahead and undercut Ezra’s entire sacrifice just to make a show where Ahsoka stands around and stares at people.
Oh dear. Heaven knows I never gave a fuck about the Star Wars lore under George Lucas, but if that's what happens under Disney, I'll stay away from it like the plague... I couldn't even finish the video, sorry Ryan!
Why? Is it really that hard to just make something...good? Oh wait it's Disney I'm talking about of course it's not good.
When she jumps off her ship in space, what exactly brings her back to the ship rather than floating off in the direction she jumped???
My absolute favorite part of this one was “Tibia” instead of “Shin”
McGuffins are tight!
'Stopping a fart is tight'  Genius
Baylan and Shin were the only things really interesting about the show. I could have watched them all day.
Literally the map ball from Treasure Planet
Leave it to Disney to make a buck. A believable story? Not so much. Major LOL.
Am I going crazy or do the two guys have different hair cuts
Does this guy time making these videos for when he gets a haircut? Films one half as writer guy, gets the haircut, films the producer guy bits? Does he do multiple scripts at a time this way? Hahahaha, that's kinda hilarious. Lol. What a process 😂
I hope pinhead has a patent on the box because that "map" looks awfully similar to it.
Why is Ezra's hair not blue?
I will never understand why the actress playing Ahsoka moves so insanely slow, and why she was cast anyway. She moves like you'd expect from an 80 years old person...
When I saw the show trailers and realized it's "chicks in space pretending to be Jedi" I already knew what was coming. When you look at the IMDB rating it looks like everybody else knew it as well.
I hard that very real laugh as you began describing Asoka exiting her spaceship to fight another ship with her light saber (the thing that doesn't even kill anymore) on the wing of her craft - you know...  in space😅
I'm so glad that these exist, so I don't have to watch a less entertaining version of these.
Because she had purple hair 😢
The live action makes these characters look soo dumb and foolishly evil. I was rooting lol for thrawn... NH
1:19 it does self cauterize
They could have killed him why did he had the helmet off first LOL
Thanks to this channel i will never pay for disney+. Thanks🎉
Animated Ashoka is better then live action Ashoka
this is peak star wars ... some say
Hahaha Disney + sucks.
The super heated magnetically contained rod of pure plasma energy cause her an owee and she needed a band aid for her booboo.
You having two haircuts was next level sir
Oh, it hurts. It hurts again to listen to the Pitch Meeting. Disney really isn't even trying with the writing anymore, are they?
The shocking thing is people actually argued me down that the writing for this show is not brain dead.
"Due for a big ploppin" is basically the official slogan of Disney + at this point.
Well okay, then... :))
Stuck between the worlds reminded me of the stuck between the tic and the tock from Babylon 5
with the writing of these shows, it makes you wonder, are they already using Ai to write these??  i don't know, maybe Ai would be a step up compared to what we get now.
Making Rosario Dawson unrecognizable is tight!!
Screenwriter guy and producer guy are a true force dyad
Is it weird that I kinda ship Producer Guy and Writer Guy
To be fair, she would know the Space Whales go to the same place because the Whales are the ones who took Ezra and Thrawn there in the first place.   But you wouldn't know that unless you watched an animated show that was made mostly for kids.
“And the best beard in the galaxy”
"So who's this Tibia person?" "....Shin." 😂😂😂
Anakin was a horrible teacher even in death... his lessons are always the wrong ones.  ...well... maybe things were different then, I guess... jobs in general did seem more fun and interesting and being able to use the Force does seem cool...  Ok, I stand corrected. I guess in the Star Wars universe it might be nicer to be alive.
The most pointless 'h' in a name.
I haven't seen "Ahsoka" and generally have no interest in Disney-era "Star Wars", but this is one of my favorite Pitch Meetings thanks to the sheer deadpanness of it all.
Honestly one of the worst shows ever made.
What is it with modern Star Wars and maps?    I don't remember the the originals being slowed down because some character didn't have the right map handy.
If anyone can find one single questionable thing about a movie, Ryan George can.
Joe Biden ss# 666-99-hell
ROFL 🤣 so awesome
fun fact, it's actually a pretty big deal that you just can't go to other galaxies in the star wars universe. It was attempted once (though disney made it non cannon as it's from EU novels) by a bunch of jedis in a ship made for that, and well, let's just say they never managed to even leave. So being "stuck in another galaxy" is quite the fun thing.
This whole show kinda gave me Youtube fanproduction vibes, but fans who never really watched Clone Wars or Rebels.
Watching and enjoying a Pitch Meeting on something you've never watched or going to watch is Tight!
For a swim For a death haha
Star wars is complete shit now. I'd rather watch Babylon 5 again.
This series single-handedly soured me on everything Disney has put out since. Absolutely terrible.
in light of more recent Pitch Meeting episodes, I now understand the girl was stabbed by the lightsaber through the part of her heart where it does not hurt.
You know ?  , how star wars is now ?,  well i dont really know , cause ye know I grew up in this all inclusive Francise in the 80's were there was no identity  BOLLITICS only to be told in my 40's that Quote 'the force is female ' so let me ask you something,  on international women's day which I love ❤️  , why flip it so much to say that star wars is not all inclusive but suddenly female , I don't know KK 😕
I wish I'd just watched this instead of that whole waste of time of a series. This was far more entertaining, efficient and didn't even exaggerate the content lol.
More like Ah-suck-a
“Not good!” 😂
I'm kind of bummed that making fun of this show was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Oh crap, I've been leaving my name and social under every video. Is that bad?
The success of this channel is such a testament to the wasteland that Hollywood story-telling has become.
Damnit Ryan I liked that idea of Ashoka now u ruined  it lol 😂
Didn't even bother to watch dizzy star whores.
Vegas Vic SS# 5463A 547 3AQ7 😂🤣
Why do Producer guy and Screenwriter guy have different haircuts? I thought they had the same Barber George
In fairness, the advantages of being alive in the Star Wars universe are really iffy since the ghosts are always able to come back and hang out.
Every decision that Thrawn made was stupid and wrong. If he turns up in the galaxy and makes the same dumb moves, he will be defeated really quickly, but now I think about it, the new republic idiots made so many stupid decisions as well. That whole galaxy is full of idiots. Or, at least the writers are all idiots.
‘And the best beard in the galaxy!’ RIP Ray Stevenson
Peak trash
Thrawn is an overrated villain of the week who looks like Captain Planet.
100% accurate
Ahsoka, you deserved this.
Didn't address the fact you need to watch the animated series for anything to make sense or have emotional impact.
I was hoping that Dave Filoni would be able to buck the stereotype of cartoon characters being exclusively for kids. What's worse than not doing that, is he wrote an entire show for man-children with an IQ below the melting point of hydrogen.
I feel like he didn’t watch rebels cause if he did there would be more emotion of excitement
So tell me about your hundreds of new awesome and unique characters, what's their deal? -They are not a white man. Being a non-white non-male is TIGHT! Let's base their entire personalities on that single trait!
"She's finally gonna be able to use the force" "Oh good for her." "Then she uses the force to send Ezra flying onto Thrawn's ship that's taking off" "She's just immediately that good at using the force?"  I feel like this is a condensed version of an argument which can be applied to almost every single female character that's come from Disney recently. Female character gets a bigger role in the story? Awesome! Really it is. Hold up they sped ran all of their character development and power scaling in 2.5 seconds and we're just supposed to move on now so the next thing can happen? Oh. Okay. Way to make a statement Disney.
I watched this and the Rebel Moon Pitch Meeting back to back and couldn't tell when it changed episodes....I'm not high, you're high.
Is Thrawn supposed to look like Elon Musk?
Another Disney Plus show I'm probably never going to watch but will always watch your pitch meetings for. Absolutely love the ending with the social security thing that's hilarious.
"We'll spend an episode on a wardrobe change."  Well yeah, there's like eight whole episodes, or maybe six, just an embarrassment of riches
This is all setting up for Sabine to become “The Mandalorian”. They can’t keep Din Jarin(a straight male) in leadership position. But now that I think about it, they already did that with Starbuck. Sabine is probably meant to replace Grogu as the Jedi Mandalorian(female Jedi)
“Do you have a new idea for me?” “Yes sir I do.”  Don’t you lie to us like that.
Sabine's force abilities are as epic and miraculous as the plot needs. Every Jedi out there needed decades of training unless, and until the plot required it. Luke trained for all of 10 minutes with Yoda and Kenobi. BOOM! Guess who's a master? Rey? Trained for maybe 3 minutes with Luke and OH LOOK. She's even more powerful than Luke!
Glad I didn’t waste time on this show.
do they have one 8 year old writing all movies now? sigh.  Make more crap even faster.  Let's get this over with.  Looking forward to life after Hollywood/Disney run by leftards.
I tried hard to like this show.  I failed.  I didn't hate it, but I would look forward to a Season Two about as much as the average person looks forward to a bowl of oatmeal.
As always very accurate pitch meeting. I actually liked the Ashoka show but only because I watch the clone wars and rebels. But even I will admit that the story was weak sauce, even so I want to believe that season 2 will improve this, if not my expectations remain low for Star Wars.
They do not do Thrawn justice.
Great, now I don’t have to watch that show (not that I was going to anyways)
A soaka lmao
Fighting ships in space with lightsabers needs to become the new jumping the shark / nuking the fridge.
"Stoppin a fart is tight."  LMAO!!!!
My request for you, good sir, is to pitch "Bound".... It is an excellent noir from the Matrix siblings. Not sure which pronouns they are currently, but we can put that aside for now.... Anywho, that would be swell.  Bound... Pitch "Bound". Thanks!! -2Ts
I died when he said "destroy a fart"🤣🤣
we're sleeping on the Shin/tibia joke, and it is criminal 😂
Only the Sith really need the map. Ahsoka doesn‘t immediately try to retrieve the information and/or destroy it. That‘s when i fIelt my intelligence being insulted and stopped watching. The Mandalorian was nobel prize literature in comparison to this toddler show. 😂
I'm so glad I didn't watch the show. It sounds...just Terrible. 😂
“For a swim” “For a death”
Come on guys - do Andor! The Honest Trailer shows  how it’s possible to satirise something that’s actually good.
The logical reasons in this vid are the main reasons for me to stop watching star wars after rey skywalker movie.
Isn't this a weird rebels spin-off? From the hyper space Wales, to the in between it seems like there picking up the ideas that show begun and doing it poorly.Dont be messing with the animated star war shows Disney, go make another trilogy or something, leave the cartoons alone!!
This show was truly just bad fanfiction. With bad acting.
Love how Ryan starts the video with 'SPOILERS AHEAD' like there was any risk of us watching the show
this guy is a legend
Oh so true...
I felt pretty let down with all the cliff hanging at the end.  Knowing our luck, Disney will cancel it and we won't get resolution.
Ashoka: Don't worry I speak whale
After all this time of waiting and trying to decide what to do i have decided to finally watch this instead of the show  Edit: i am happy with my decision
I love how Ryan laughs when describing the Ahsoka vs space ship scene.
I'm surprised there was no mention of the force-sensitive kid who was a plot convenience to discover Ahsoka somehow lightsaber battling someone on another plane of existence while her body... didn't succumb to drowning?
Stopping a fart does require tightness
0:57 it's treasure planet 😂
A** soaker
Thrawn looks like a bad-CGI Smurf version of Eli Musk.
What I don't understand is how people are so upset that Sabine just suddenly was able to use the force after she had previous training in the force, while Savage Oppress takes a 15-second lesson with Count Dooku and can suddenly lift a rock with the force.
You know after a few years of watching like 100 of these pitch meetings, it's clear that basically all of Hollywood is nothing but recycled cliches and predictable plot contrivances without any originality. Kinda like our society. Oh wait....
I'm too intimidated to even attempt to watch star wars stuff, but just wanted to point out how cool her design is.
"and the best beard in the galaxy..." 😅😅
“…and all the stormtroopers forget that they are holding guns”. ROFL🤣
this is painfully accurate
Wait, so there's just a hyperspace ring thing that sends you to other galaxies? Good to know we just ripped off Stargate *and* butchered another piece of Star Wars canon while we were at it!
🤔 actually yeah, they all act very emotionless. Sabin finally reuniting with Ezra, Ashoka in general, Thrawn free, the Witch seeing Thrawn finally for the first time. Its like disney is afraid that if they have emotions, fans will hate them forever
So people are actually paying a monthly subscription fee to watch this garbage on Disney +?  Does anybody have the mailing list for Disney + subscribers?  I am willing to pay extra for these names since its evident they can be sold just about anything.
2:10 gold
It's sad that I now watch reviews of shows and movies instead of watching the actual shows and movies. The whole entertainment industry is in such a sad state.
Ashoka was one of the largest and most festering turds, Disney has created.😅😅😅😅
Baylan was easily the best part of that show... RIP.
And even after Ahsoka learns her apparently very important lesson that she needs to live and not die, she doesn't do anything. She just wakes up (submerged, mind) and waits passively for someone to rescue her. lol.
Thanks for this! Now I don't have to watch this nightmare!😃
yep, that's Disney Star Wars.  Put a chick in it and make it lame.
Current Star Wars really dislikes previous sacrifices of the characters.  Ezra, you sacrificed yourself to remove Thrawn from power and help protect your galaxy.  Sorry, your friend is lonely.  Anakin, you sacrificed yourself to remove the Emperor from power, just kidding it was a clone.
My god, how do you keep such a positive sound in your voice while going through all that sarcasm? I'd be rolling on the floor the whole time. I'd never get anything filmed.
I don’t like how Disney are portraying force powers.  I always were under the illusion that the force was a discipline, but Disney has shown us with all of their content surrounding the force that it is a all or nothing thing. As soon as you have tapped into it you can do anything you want. Like force pushing isn’t channeling and emitting the force through control, it’s just open up the floodgates in one specific direction
Ugh. I'm continuously more and more delighted that I cancelled D+ and not wasting any time watching these embarrassing useless Disney Star Wars shows.
2:33 - Trying to pull a Gandalf on a completely meaningless and result-free near death experience is the most Disney that it gets these days. Still trying to cash in on the payoffs _they forgot to _*_set up._* Gandalf came back as "the White" because 1) his near death carried *_meaning_* as he had *sacrificed* himself to save the Fellowship and - in extension - the whole of Middle Earth and 2) because the former White Wizard had fallen from grace and his job was vacant for a new, better suited candidate to take. What exactly did Ahsoka accomplish when getting her butt served to her?
ASucker!!!!
Admiral Thrawn represents Culture and the Art of War. He's basically the total opposite of your average mustache twerling Imperial. It's what makes him so damn dangerous. Unfortunately they just totally humiliated the poor Voice Actor who they literally got to play a terrible dumbed down version of his most famous role.
Wow this show is shit
I get that this is all satire, but are there any that were genuinely difficult to make fun of because they kind of nailed it?
The whole show was fanservice which I did appreciate but by the end it's not something I could recommend
Ah, so that's your archetype for beards Explains a lot.
Ahsoka: extremely agile and nimble Live action Ahsoka: as fast as a drunk uncle on christmas
Even the droid asked Ahsoka "How do you know these whales are going to the exact same place where Sabine was taken to?" And she said "I don't, but somewhere is better than nowhere"  No, it fucking isn't! XD
A little help please.  Does the light sabre use the force as an energy source, or do they have atomic AA batteries built into the handle? I can't remember seeing any Jedi plugging it into their USB charger next to their bed overnight.
4.49 is so bad. Ragdoll stormtroopers before they are even hit. Appreciate the 6 minute funny version Ryan, not that I was going to watch any more Disney turds
Luke have i ever told you about Ahsoka Tano
It's such a massive tell that Disney has lost ALL ability for creative thought that ALL of their damned spin off shit has been titled the name of the main character! It's so fucking bad. "Andor, Ahsoka, Obi-Wan, Book of Boba Fett, the Mandolorian (his name is MANDO), EVEN SOLO!! And The Rise of Skywalker" FFS! Once you realize that you're just like holy shit do they have NO fucking idea what creativity is anymore. Their shit has been so fucking bad that you'd think they'd learn to go back to creative and good naming conventions. Imagine if "A New Hope" was titled "Luke" or imagine if "The Shining" was titled "Jack" or if "Breaking Bad" was titled "Walt" LMFAO! If you have so little creativity and are so fucking spineless that you cannot bring yourself to title your movies/shows an actual good creative title that will raise the bar of creativity... what is the fucking point? It's no longer cinema at that point, it's meaningless, pointless, cynical, CONTENT. Disney Star Wars is so designed-by-corporate-board-members that they think they HAVE to put the name of the main character as the title otherwise people won't want to see it... they forget that it's FUCKING STAR WARS! Star Wars is about creativity. They just think that everyone in the world is as idiotic as they are. Ironically they are just destroying the franchise pandering to the lowest IQ. There is no better way to communicate to your audience that you don't give a shit about your content than to give it the most generic non-title you possibly could. It's a million times better to discover who the main character is than to be told who they are. We know what's going to happen in ever single one of these. It's such a shame Andor had to have that shit title, no one even likes him as a character. Why the fuck didn't they just put an entirely new character in there and title it SOMETHING GOOD!? Oh but that would be actual work... Disney, YOU SUCK.
Invincible Girl boss theater. It is such a shame this crap was Ray Stevenson’s last project. He will always be remembered as Titus Pullo.
hahaha disney sucks so hard
Tibia? Snaps. You win
Nowadays I just watch your video before even watching Disney, Marvel or DC to keep updated
I watched season 1 of the Mandalorian and then i just stopped consuming any Star Wars content after that. I dont think i can find a reason to reconsider.
Why can’t these studios hire people like Ryan and get a feedback screening to fix these loopholes in plot?
The part where Sabine hands over the map for one person is honestly just lazy writing. Yes, you can go on about how it's personal attachment over duty but at the end of the day, she hasn't really learned anything or suffered the consequences of her actions. She doomed the galaxy for a *chance* at finding Ezra again and somehow it all worked out (even tho she's stranded in a different galaxy, something I'm sure will be solved in the first 5 minutes of the next series/movie). I wanted so badly for her to just say "no, he's gone and I have to accept that" and try to destroy the map when she had the chance. It wouldn't have worked as we figured out later but at least she'd have some amount of character growth. We would've still gone to the other galaxy and Thrawn would've still come back but at least it wouldn't be because of an angsty teenage girl wanting to see a boy again. And it would've made the reunion scene even more emotional since she already accepted that he's gone. I am staggered that Dave created this series and allowed his characters that he wrote for Clone Wars and Rebels to devolve into this mess. It's a shame that not even this titan of Star Wars writing can withstand Disney's control over content.
This was spot on!
why are those phones ringing? seriously do these dudes work in a call center?
I couldn’t make it more than an episode and a half through this shitty Star Wars show. Andor season 2 can’t come soon enough.
I'm baffled by all these groups wanting to take over from Palpatine,wasn't he an elected official..So how are these groups 🤔 going to rule?
Also how ezra had trouble fighting the stormtroopers with his saber but beat a bumch with just the force
Thrawn called Sabine out on it, Baylan used it to his advantage, and Ashoka kinda called her out on it too when she gave Ezra a big hug 🤷🏼‍♂️
Worst show of the year after the Idol
Everybody who watches pitch meetings for movies that they haven't even seen say I 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Minor nitpick: Ahsoka chose to land next to Baylan so she could steal his mount, slowing him down.
Animated Ashoka was fun and snippy, but live action Ashoka is a statue
Still no Andor? I know it’s hard to satirise something that’s actually excellent, but Honest Trailers have done a good job!
Wow star wars is complete shit now
Wait, why did the producer guy know who ahsoka is?  Is she some sort of famous jedi in ep7~9?  I watched all Star Wars from 1~6, but nobody mentioned her.
I love how when the droids sent to find the map lose against Ashoka they just go “well, screw it. Let’s Nagasaki this bi***.”
OUTRO SOUNDS LIKE MORRISSEY
Been a busy day. Wasn't sure if I'd have the time to watch this. But I did, barely an inconvenience! 😁
I can't wait for season two when Mace L Windu comes back to life and screams PURPLE LIGHT SABER MAGIC
I hate spoilers but I can't resist another episode XD
DISney is DISgusting.
Is it just me or is the map the same as the one from treasure planet?
There is no like button. Only dislike. On Android phone. First time I've seen this.
So its shitty and I shouldn't watch it? OK, thanks.
So great 😂😂😂
"OH STOPPING A FART IS TIGHT!" Might just be the best thing I have ever heard anyone ever say
I loved the show but this was perfect lol
Ahhh... A chick flick
Shin Tibia...her final form. Wow wow wow wow.  Wow!
Lol all the reasons Disney destroyed Starwars
"Sabine's finally gonna be able to use the Force, she's been trying to do that this whole season."  Rey: "Why didn't she just immediately know how to do it? Is she stupid?"
"She gets inside a whale?"
So the writers for Ahsoka think it's 40k, gotcha! Melee attacks against Starfighters.
Thanks again.  Another thing I can avoid.
Disney Star Wars is so lesser.
I just realized the background sound to these videos is from the generic office background videos on youtube!
This makes me happy that I only wasted one episode worth of my life on this crap
Disney is not even trying. Star Wars is dead, they are just defiling the corpse at this point.
Before the Kenobi series came out, I was actually a little excited for what Ahsoka was going to be. Thrawn is probably my favorite star wars character.  Ultimately, it seems that the wait for the show was not due to ensuring peak quality. Which was definitely not a surprise to me after the Kenobi series, but I had hopes that Disney could still pull a win out of it.  Percy Jackson is going to be released this month on Disney Plus, and I believe that Eragon will also be getting a reboot soon as well. If they ruin these series, having both already suffered from horrible adaptations in the past, then I will NEVER forgive Disney for hiring consistently awful writers and prioritizing dogma over storytelling.
this show is so bad i cant even sit through the mocking of it.
Lots of really good points.  The show was so bad. I was super disappointed. But the pitch meeting is a solid 9.5!
Disney never understod what SW was..
Who the fuck writes plots like that? o_O
Pitch meeting: have Rosario Dawson fold her arms so that the cartoon fans are too distracted to see the horrible writing.
(I haven't watched the series) wait so Sabine force-throws Ezra onto Thrawn's ship but doesn't do the same for herself or Ahsoka?
REBOOT STAR WARS
Do a scavengers reign please
Thank God I didnt watch the show, it sounds incredible stupid.  But at least we got another great pitch meeting out of it👍
you should have watched Rebels before making this.
The stabbing being meaningless is spot on
I remember being excited when Disney bought Star Wars because I desperately wanted more content. I even convinced myself that episodes 7, 8, and 9 wasn't complete trash. How wrong I was...
Damn, 1977-1983 really was the golden age, huh? I just...I want this franchise to be good again...please?
I love how I can watch this without first having seen the show safe in the knowledge that any semblance of plot is going to wash over me and be instantly forgettable.
Yea Disney sucks these days
Dammit. I like Ahsoka, but after hearing this it makes it seem so stupid. I don’t care I still like it. I’m happy with my purchase of the dual legacy lightsabers for $360.
Disney's ashoka. Should be renamed from star wars ashoka.
Barely an inconvenience 🤣  Gets me every time
To be fair, Baylan DOES have a nice beard.
I swear, some of these things he described could've been bits on SNL years ago.
“Stopping a fart is tight” 💀
My favorite part of this is the way Producer Guy  says “not good”. 1:37
Watching the pitch meeting instead of the actual show is tight.
Will there ever be one of these for Andor? My hope will last eternally lol
I liked Ahsoka. I’m surprised so many people trashed it. I hated the Sabine character but other than that I thought it was pretty good
Disney really forgot why galaxy is always afraid of light sabre wielding Jedi. Stupid Disney ruining everything they put their hands onto.
Wow way to summarize this steaming pile of poo
Star wars está bien muerto.😢
Jesus who watches this crap? lol
So the map is like a hellraiser cube?
Definitely not the best beard in the galaxy. I've seen Many. Better. Beards. They're kind of my favorite thing.
Sci Fi fans got fucked this decade. All these hack writers and producers ruined these franchises for years to come. Star wars, fucked. star trek, mostly fucked. Stargate, forgotten then turned into a shitty low budget game. Dr. Who, fucked. Halo, fucked. Probably many more I'm missing, but you get the picture.
Wait... so now Star wars takes place in 2 galaxies far, far way ? Do they have a new kind of light speed to go there too ?
They stole the map from Treasure Planet
It’s good any ol actor gets jobs nowadays  and a celeb gets work left right and center on the super duper verse
The only virtue Disney Star Wars content has is that it provides continuous fodder for these Pitch Meetings.
Not regretting my decision to abandon the Star Wars fandom a couple years ago.  Sounds like a complete mess over there.
I sure love having one of my favorite Star Wars characters get their personality and competence obliterated by idiot writers. (Naturally, I'm talking about Thrawn. Poor Thrawn. Look how they massacred my boy.)
PUT A CHICK IN IT AND MAKE HER GAY!!!!
Thrawn was supposed to be one of the most intelligent beings in the starwars universe turns out hes real dumb 😂
There was a lot to call out in this show, but rewatching that ridiculously absurd shot of Sabine and Ezra nonchalantly walking out of the room as Elsbeth is supposed to stop each of them specifically was VERY painful
I enjoyed Ahsoka but this is completely deserved and he could have also gone after the idea that allasudden Sabine has Force powers when nobody on Rebels, including two Force users, noticed anything about her, for years. Hmm.
When you boil it down Rosario Dawson is just getting a needed paycheck.
Tickling is Tight!
I feel sorry for the cast. The cast were mostly great. The script... was not.
Also "anyone can use the force if you believe and focus" 🙄
disney is glitter on poop
So much wasted potential. The character is great, and Rozario Dawson is perfectly cast to play her. And Ray Stevenson looks absolutely badass.   Yet I found myself growing angry and disgusted watching – I already had very low expectations from watching the trailer, so I wouldn't describe what I felt as disappointment.  Just a series of exercises in style over substance, with nonsensical tropes strung between.  We already lost the Mandalorian, and this one was DOA, but at least we still had one good season of Andor. Who knows if we'll have another should Kennedy's reptilian scrutiny fall more closely on it.  Once again thank you Ryan for watching the whole season so those of us who fell along the way can be grateful that we didn't.
She was a good friend.
How to destroy the best Star Wars character Part 1
All the crap people gave Anakin for prioritizing one person over the entire galaxy... And Sabine doesn't get so much as a slap on the wrist. 😐
And the Disney losing streak remains in tact.  I don't know what is more horrifying, their destruction of 3 storied franchises and their suite of animation projects or their ability to do all that and still avoid bankruptcy.  They seem to be like an immortal curse on mankind, like war, disease and famine.  Just have to learn to cope with it and try to survive it.
He said “shin” I heard “sh!t” 😅
What they didn't show in the world between worlds is that Ashoka actually fought the Balrog and then fell down a pit but was resurrected and became Ashoka the white. And then Naruto unlocked his bankai by going super saiyan and then said "live long and prosper".     (I just wanted to annoy as many nerds as possible)
"Tickled by a lightsaber" is the best way to describe a lightsaber fight made by Disney
..
Is there still anybody in the disney star woke, that can´t use the force?
"Bad guys love having secret maps that lead to them."....That's tight!
Very funny! Legit criticism too. However I will say I still really enjoyed watching the Ashoka show despite its flaws. Loved the many lightsaber battles!
Military genius Thrawn leaves his Star Destroyer connected to the ground so his enemies could get on board
He forgot to mention that ninja girl is a mandalorian for some reason and has to cut her hair to wear the helmet. There's so much clumsy forgettable content in that series it's hard to even make fun of it all.
Would love to see you do a pitch meeting on Andor. It’d be a nice change for you to get to watch a Disney Star Wars show that doesn’t suck.
Gad this whole story is so stupid.  Thank god I didn't waste time watching it.
I’ve watched this at least 10x, but whenever I see that smirk and big eyes, I can’t resist but to click it again.
I would love to see your basement dwelling self do better... you guys act like you know something.. blows my mind
Please make a pitch meeting for Momento
Watching these instead of the actual show or movie is tight
"For a swim? For a death!"😆
Where is ZEB?!! Show makes zero sense - they add stupid characters that never existed prior and leave out ZEB?! Morons 😅
The biggest plot hole of the show is that once Ahsoka found the ball map, all she had to do is break out her lightsabers and destroy it. Of course, the series would only be 15 minutes long, so there's that.
Stopping a fart is tight.
Qui Gon died because of one little poke in the gut by a light saber.
People keep forgetting - lightsabers are only dangerous if you have an allergy to them. Just carry antihistamines, works a treat.  The bearded actor had a lot of positive comments even from critics - and then he dies in real life. We just can't have nice things, I guess.
S h e power!
Oh noos, another masterpiece I've missed. How can I miss these awesome shows?
I’m so exhausted by this lack of sexual chemistry/passion in post-orig-trig Star Wars. Where is the love? Give me a reason to care! Let some people kiss each other!
I do take your point. You're HILARIOUS. I was therefore forced to subscribe.
I hate how Disney ruined the concept of Lightsabers. Is there any point to them if they are longer fatal?
Destroying a brand I've loved since I was a kid for the sake of content was easy, barely an inconvenience. 😅😊😢😭
God I do love watching Pitch Meeting!! 😂❤
correct me if I'm wrong , but isn't Ezra Bridger the protagonist of star wars : Rebels ? so is it canon now?
Why no Andor pitch meeting? Is it too hard to mock?
Funny AF!
Thank you for the rundown. I don't need to watch it now XD
Disney is dead.
Tremendous 🤣🤣🤣
Remember kids, all of Ryan’s joking aside, there WAS a pitch meeting and a green light for this. Idk, I guess I’d still watch it if it was the only thing on in the prison commons.
…There really is no nice way of saying this; I have tried multiple different ways at this point so here it goes.    This was so bad that even you couldn’t make it entertaining.  You triumphed over the ungodly horrors of Catwoman and Cats, you even Morbed on Moonfall  without making me bored but this was a new type of feeling.  An apathetically empty feeling.
And here I thought rings or power gandalf declaring "i am good" was peak cringe  Disney: hold my rootbeer.
It makes a lot of sense, if you don't think about it.
Man, the sheer amount of wasted potential the Star Wars series has is just depressing. Beyond the original trilogy, IMHO only the video games and the novels - well, some of them xD - really make imaginative and inspired use of the setting and lore; the "reference" books are also brilliant worldbuilding, in fact some of the best worldbuilding ever (as a kid I used to love poring over those incredibly detailed "exploded" diagrams of ships and their interiors, engines, power sources etc.). It's nominally satisfying to see Star Wars back on the screen in a significant way, but apart from that the Disney acquisition has been a constant downward spiral of disappointment with only a few glimmers of originality and intrigue, largely a consequence of an unfocused and floundering creative vision that all too often succumbs to emotionally hollow nostalgia.   A demonstrative example of this creatively bankrupt obsession with the past is the fact that Tatooine the predominant setting for FOUR of the Disney+ series, despite already being a highly important location in "A New Hope", "Return of the Jedi" and "The Phantom Menace".  The Star Wars galaxy is supposedly massive, and yet we're constantly constrained to a single aesthetically nondescript desert location that could easily be any desert on Earth; there's very little that's alien, otherworldly or awe-inspiring about it, unlike say the planet-encompassing city of Coruscant, or the incredible verdant vistas of Naboo and its distinctive dome-riddled architectural style.  Show us something new! Show us the homeworld of one of the many recurring alien species, like the Twilek, the Cereans, the Vurk, the Quermian, the Togruta or the Zabrak (hell, just SHOW us more aliens in general, and make them main characters ffs)! It's genuinely insane that they have such an expansive setting yet they squander it with this constant recycling of characters and places and plots and themes and even twists. It's almost like they're intentionally trying to make it as uninteresting as they possibly can, it's just so bizarre.   Such a waste of an immersive fictional universe! Remember this guy? Remember this guy? Remember this not-so-secret map that gives you the exact coordinates of the villain's main base for some weird reason (who is actually making these maps in the first place?!), it's not like we've ever used this plot device before?  The series has lost its most vital ingredient - a sense of wonder. And I don't think it's ever gonna get it back, not unless there's a radical overhaul of Disney's creative team, because whoever they've got on that team right now probably doesn't even have the word "creative" in their vocabulary. Lifeless corporate stooges will write lifeless corporate stories. Such a shame.
Maybe it shouldn't have, but that 'Tibia/Shin' joke killed me so hard... Am I the only one?
Disney  writing is truly atrocious.  too bad the writers guild strike actually came to an end
Having two different haircuts is tight!
They're making the force look pathetic, its meant to be hard to master, another Mary Sue just using the force like a plaything..
I started watching the show.. and thought I would have to watch it through it for continuity.. but then I remembered this channel and now I get the important stuff without the suffering. You're a godsend, sir!
Tibia 🤣
Is nobody going to talk about the fact that this show stole the same macguffin from Treasure Planet?
2:01  It’s hilarious how this happens in so many movies/shows.  That’s like having a professional marksman with a Barrett .50 Cal dangling on a rope ladder attached to a helicopter above and then just swinging him right at an enemy
0:58 and 1:11 … What the F are these hairdos doing in Star Wars ?? 😂 No one would look like that lmao
Wait, why does that "map" look so similar to Tresure Planet
Hey Ryan, I see you have covered all the mid star wars shows but you haven't covered Andor. I assume it's because it is too good to make fun of so prove me wrong.
AT least they didn't turn it into a big McDonalds commercial like Loki.
man.... they really hit new depths with this one. Every time...**every** time! - I think "this" one is going to be good... but no.
First time I know there is an Ahsoka show
I always enjoy how lightsaber stabbings somehow never turn into full-on dismemberings even though dragging a lightsaber through someone's body is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Thank you Disney ruining star wars  for me ,woke.Force is not female 😭😭
All these badly written shows are really making a case for AI doing a better job.
Rip Ray Stevenson aka Balon
Im so glad I stopped watching Star Wars and Marvel content 10 years ago
Awesome and hilarious as usual! Please never stop.
Ha ha ha this is awesome. Thanks, now I don't have to waste my time watching that show.
Even you explaining it makes this sound annoyingly bad, I’m glad I never got into Star Wars, and never will.
Sabine got ahold of the force quicker than Luke did... I feel like the "character development" idea is not one thoroughly explored. What a great decision.
Was Sabine wearing zombie makeup? I think she was wearing zombie makeup.
Please do Andor! PLEASE do Andor! Please please PLEASE do Andor! I mean ... please do a Pitch Meeting for Andor. I'm not advocating that you try and hook up with Diego Luna. Although ... who knows? Your wife could be down with that. I mean ... it's Diego Luna. I'D probably be down with that. Okay then ... sayin too much about ANDOR, for which you should totally do a pitch meeting.
Okay, so when you put it THAT way... it does sound dumb
2 different haircuts!
You really need to be a reddit disney phenotype to actually enjoy these shows now.
Secret review at 1:37
And now we are going to see Filoni manage to screw up Timothy Zahn's characters and plots because apparently Lucas' and his own weren't enough.
I am amused that this pitch meeting vid on YT has more comments than the actual show had viewers.
Wow. I just watched this and completely forgot C-3PO was in this. Nice.
There were a couple of good ideas, but the Ahsoka series turned into another "girl boss" series that Disney is so wanton to do. I also think the idea of Ahsoka having to come to terms with Anakin becoming Vader was great though it needed a little work. To abstract. Sometimes it is best to call out a therapy session for what it is. Thrawn was again the single greatest disappointment in the series because NO ONE knows how to handle Thrawn. After Rebels he shouldn't have even been a villain. He should have formed a tepid alliance with Ezra against Thrawn's homeworld enemies and Ezra would finish his journey to becoming a Jedi by negotiating a peace with an enemy seemingly impossible to negotiate with by thinking differently from Thrawn and thus arriving at a different answer. Much better story.
We we're supposed to get Grand Admiral Thrawn. Instead we got Thrawnathen.
Spot on mister!
I need that beard...
Imagine stabbing someone with a lightsaber and not, like, moving it around a little.
I binged all of Rebels before watching this show, and I actually really liked it.  So when I came into this new show and it turned out to be a Rebels sequel fanfic, I didn't actually mind all that much.    I can't imagine being a fan of Ahsoka (the character) right now, though, especially one who hasn't seen Rebels.  Probably a lot like being a Boba Fett fan, except at least she's only been around a for decade or so.  Fett fans had half a century of buildup before getting _their_ hopes slowly run over by rainbow vespas.
🤣 due to vocabulary deficits i can't tell you Mister Ryan how much grateful i'm for your wonderful service that i don't have to watch n suffer through another SW- series since the Mandalorian (which at least wasn't that borderline contradicting) and Obi-wan-blabla... already took their toll. specially the latter. A 10000 thanks from Tyrol/Austria for sparing me a lot of pain *plzKEEEPonROOOCKING*
01:36 "... who's stuck in another galaxy." You mean another star system, Bcause the star wars universe all plays in one galaxy..
I am just realizing how similar that map sphere is to the one from Treasure Planet. Another Disney property.
somehow youtube unsubscribed me from ur channel.... very odd. also i love a picture i saw online that photoshopped an actual ass on her face and said ASSOKA
It's sad how awful something is that doesn't have to be....  but it is.
I feel like there was a missed opportunity to say something like “how does someone fight in space? Do laws of physics apply in this galaxy?” “I don’t know.” “That works”
Kills a fart is tight! xD hahahah Love it! Great video!
I love how you speedrun the whole series until Ezra happens, because nothing happens until he shows up.
Put a chick in it and make it lame
You should do an andor pitch meeting, would love to see how that goes
He didn’t say “super easy, barely an inconvenience”
trawn is like elon musk but just less evil.
I love that producer guy got a new haircut. But pitch guy didn't
But if you have seen clone wars and rebels a lot of this behaviour makes total sense
Do Andor now
How come a lightsaber can cut through an armored space fighter with a force field but not Sabine?
the sabine show. worst show i've seen, tbh.
As much as I enjoyed the Ahsoka character in the Clone Wars, this series is absolutely awful. Space whales? WT...
He has the best beard in the galaxy 🤣🤣 So true.
Disney- "You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."
I actually felt bad about not getting a Disney+ subscription to watch Ahsoka - since I loved her in Clone Wars and (a little less) in Rebels.  But hearing what the show was actually like, it doesn't really bother me anymore. Money saved.
Thanks to Pitch Meeting I don't have to watch terrible movies/TV shows I don't wanna watch. Just have Ryan give me the entire synopsis to confirm whether it's good or bad. 99.9% of the time it IS bad! Pitch Meeting has saved me from wasting HOURS of my life on stuff like this! 😊
They should have titled it “Shaqueeshonda Washington”
"The best beard in the galaxy." 😂
The only good thing in the show was Hayden/Anakin 😭 it's so depressing that Disney even made ahsoka insufferable
God this was a terrible terrible show..
Oh man, that "not good" killed me lmao
Girls get it done...in SPACE!
Rebels season 5 wasn't so bad
Just a terrible Star Wars series.
This is what happens when Chatgpt writes a show.
I made it through 3 episodes after several weeks. At the start of the 4th, I can't take it anymore. 1 word, dramatic pause, 2 words from the next character, dramatic pause, Ahsoka slowly closes her eyes, opens them slower, says 2 words, dramatic pause.... and so on. But it continues on to other characters, we cut to a scene of the bad guys. 3 words, dramatic pause, 2 words from another bag guy, dramatic pause.... I'm done
What was that show?!
Ez Pz.
Haha “who is this Tibia person…” her name is shin 😆 comedic gold🏅
the only thing you missed was taking all the sword fighting and slowing it way down and removing most of the choreography otherwise spot on!
This show was so bad and underwhelming that it hurts. I don't get people still praising Filoni for this stuff
The best beard in the universe
I’m sorry, so we’re NOT gonna talk about how Anakin fights Ashoka and she relives parts of the Clone Wars as a child?
I did really like the references to clone wars and rebels, but they didn’t really explain anything that happened in the shows, they mostly just assumed everyone has seen them
Can Dave Filoni f all the way off now? Jesus, this show made Book of Boba Fett look semi-competent by comparison.
"Who's this Tibia person?"  Anatomy puns are tight!
The most different these 2 have ever looked.
Producer: Who is this Tibia person? Writer:  Shin. Producer: What did I say?  Me: 💀💀💀
"Stopping a fart is tight" Lol, one of the best usage of the catchphrase! 😂
This series is so stupid and boring Ryan cant make it interested even in irony
They put a chick in it and made her gay....and lame.
Wait so Thrawn actually does look exactly like Elon Musk and that's not just a meme?
Thank you for saving me so much time
The show was decent until they rode space whales to the exact planet they need to be at.  After that the show was a joke.  Sabine runs head on into 2 Tie fighters and then crashes head first into the ground but then the ship saves them shortly later with not 1 scratch on it.  The part I couldn't stand the most was the battlestar ship was at the top of a temple that was on top of a huge mountain.  They launch the ship and the 3 jedi manage to get to the top of the temple(that's on top of a mountain!)  and the ship had only moved about 20 feet.  They then fight for another 10 minutes and the ship is only 40 feet in the air.  Slowest launching ship in all of Sci-Fi history.  Whew, got that off my chest
Beautifully accurate.
I like how even though you have your own channel now, you still show headlines from Screen Rant.
Nice
What killed the series for me was the fact that travelling to another galaxy was kind of underwhelming. In Star Wars that is a huuuuge achievment and you would have expected to see strange new things and have a sense of wonder or something. But nooooo, just a plain, pretty standard looking planet and that's basically it.
I thought Ahsoka was good minus the sexy lil sith getting beat by a rando
They picked the perfect actor for her.
Is this show a joke? Disney actually spent money on this shit...
my family is in the army . they dont really care about the plot...but there is 0 tactical combat, 0 strategie, it look like a kid fantasy, nothing make sense. my mom said pfff even i would have conquered the galaxy at that point just by using logic
Nice
Ash ⚱️ is a good 👍 and the house 🏠 is a good 👍 is the house 🏠 to wo boli na ga kya aaj tak live on on
Master Qui-Gon might have some disagreement with the lethality (or rather, non-lethality) of a lightsaber to the chest.
I love it so much ❤
'shin', tibia 😂
GURL!  POWER! Yeah that’s all Hollywood has to say any more. Nothing else.
"stopping a fart is tight"... I think it was the wittiest thing I've heard recently.
Ryan should make more pitch meetings of classic movies like Shrek, Lilo & Stitch, Finding Nemo and Toy Story 2, 3 and 4
Maps to people's locations are tight!
If Ryan doesn't say "barely an inconvenience" its not a pitch 😂
lol this is why i dont watch star wars. 1.5 good movies in the star wars catalogue. meh. kathleen kenedy a real dumdum.
Anyone praising Filoni needs to reevaluate their life's meaning. He writes like a 10 year old.
Can you please do the Saw movies?
“Lord Vader, there are a Luke Skywalker and a Ben Kenobi in the planet that you were born, do you want us to investigate further?” “Nahhhhh”
Herrera, Scott, Matt, Admin, Garand.   TFB.  Make a March madness of guntubers
Do Jason Statham Death Race next, that movie is a gold mine from start to finish.
Look it's fine. Youtube auto censors social security numbers, see!  □□□-□□-□□□□
Ahsoka was clearly made by people that hate Star Wars and the fans.
Which one is Ryan?
Glad I didn’t re sub to Disney for this garbage.
I love how a single episode of South Park can destroy a legacy.
"Content for the sake of content". This little sentence describes the majority of new movies and shows not only for Disney but more or less everywhere.
I didnt bother to watch yet another Disney SW series and now I’m glad I didn’t! Thanks Ryan! 😂
To be fair, if the starfighters stayed far away it would make their shots easier to block.
How do you spell Disney? D, O, N, E
You are video it's very good
Nice
I love watching your videos.  Interesting as always.
Stoppin' a fart is tightARE YOU KIDDING ME RYAN?! give the man some money or a medal
Please cover the Five Nights at Freddy's movie
COULD YOU PLEEEEAASE MAKE A BAD BATCH ONE 🙏🙏🙏🙏
have you done andor ?
I wish I had a Disney Fairy God Mother like Grand Admiral Thrawn does in this series to make all my wishes and dreams come true 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So much better then watching the actual show 🤣
Super video
Technically, a stab wound by lightsaber would cauterize instantly, so yeah, not a huge health risk.
Can you do Charlie Brown pitch meetings?  Watching the great pumpkin now and this "plot" ... it would be perfect
"Best beard in the galaxy." Totally agree.
They smashed all the cancel shoes into this
Five Nights at Freddie’s pitch meeting, please!!
So everyone has the force now Yeah sure probably whatever i dont care
Please do The wizard of Oz
How about...............Demolition man
Seems,like a,trash show and as a beardless guy dont feel represented either 😂
https://youtu.be/Nlk8BaczaZY?si=SmBvZWgwQzhkk9fZ
Bbxncnc
This one was perfection...
It makes me realise how crappy writing is these days.
The  "What?" after "best beard in the galaxy" is tight.
Very glad he called out Sabine betraying the entire galaxy just for a guy. Not a guy with potential like Anakin, just a guy. Who looks like he could be a barista
Lightsabers are incredibly effective against anything but humans.
I don't even like star wars I just wanted to hear Ryan talk some more.
I like how he makes no reference to Hera, her child or chopper and the series still makes perfect (non)sense
Haha! "Whos this, uh, Tibia person?" "Shin.. " "What'd I say?" XD "He doesn't wanna waste recources." "Wha..." "So anyways..."
The space whales bother me so much. You can't even come up with some new cool alien that does the same exact thing the space whales did?
Best part, is when the writers that wrote that shit go on strike to get more money to write more shit.
what if in season 2 they just have everybody switch places back but this time instead of space whales, it's space monkeys!
Its so strange that this channel made most of the star wars streaming show, but not andor i wonder why they still haven't made it🤔
I've never noticed it before, but you put background audio of people talking and phones ringing in these? That's such a small thing that most creators aren't doing and all we get to hear normally is bad nonEQ'd music or just bland dead audio, or worse their fan system. Great work as always.
Everything you just said...Is actually kinda right. Ridiculous bs show
Such a frickin' worthless show. Disney had ground Star Wars into the dirt. Pricks.....
The everything is most pure.
The everything is most pure.
The everything is most pure.
Well when you put it like that... It sounds terrible...... wait!..... I guess its pretty horrible no matter how you put it.
One of the worst Star Wars series to date
I was wondering if you could do a pitch meeting for “The Whole Nine Yards” In honor of the late great Mathew Perry. If not maybe do a revisited of Friends. Just a thought. Love the videos. Have a great day
Put a chick in it!  MAKE HER GAAAY!
Hold on. We slap *a* nostalgia cameo in? That whole show was one giant nostalgia cameo! For those of us who watched Rebels and Clone Wars, anyway.
It is very interesting video I liked that video
Wow im so glad they're still milking that star wars teet
Yeah, it was a very simple plot for Ahsoka, once you think about it. They just trade places between galaxies about sums it up! Of course, Ahsoka will be back, barely an inconvenience. Ahsoka could probably mind meld with a space whale and hitch a ride back home in another season.
Lol, could have mentioned the robot guy saying how unlikely it is for the whales to go there and yet they do and they don’t even seem surprised 😆
I hope people get beyond Pitch Meeting. I never watch this channel and had samples of this channel. Its not great and poorly made episodes.
So they stole the map from treasure planet… cool.
Yeah I’m 100% just determine what content to watch based on pitch meetings. Skipping this one!  I wish they would put out quality Star Wars stuff.
Ryan we need an andor pitch meeting, cant believe there is not already one
Why do i keep see these Copy paste videos in my stream?  Im not subscribed, i dont watch this channel, i am not interested. Have you seen one Pitch meeting, you have seen them all. Nothing new, no variation, same face, same plot, same pitch script, just different "insert name" themes.
The show actually sounds really good
The clowns in the comments don’t realize that everything isn’t bad just because it gets a pitch meeting video. Ahsoka is the greatest live action Star Wars content that Disney has created.
He DOES have the best beard in the galaxy, the rest is meh.
Don't forget she fight's like she's 80 even though her character was supposed to be one of the faster/technical fighters
honestly incredible that andor was so good ryan couldn't do it a pitch meeting
Tight😅
When he said "who's this Tibia person that attacked Sabine" XD had me on the floor😂
Cant believe this show and some of the characters are set in the SAME universe as ANDOR.
I confused that title for the Indian film Ashoka
Wtf was Baylon even doing in his final scene standing in front of a mountain w a monument that looks like him??  Tf
Nice
Before i watch this, i just came.here to say, and mind you i am on the lightsaber battle against the droids in the 8th episode, this show doesnt hold a candle to Andor. They dropped the ball on this. This is what people wanted i guess. NOT ONCE did i feel the characters were in any danger. The stakes were never high.  Its sad to be honest.
Nice video
4:13 is incorrect, the Tie Fighters were sent last before they raid the tower with Zombies, instead 2 gunships with the troopers Ahsoka landed to deal with were sent and 3 mercenary fighters deployed from the ring chased her ship.
The saddest part of this is that this pitch meeting seems too long to have been pitched for this show.  The real pitch seems to have been "Ahsoka, a hot alien strong woman"  *nods* "Dave will do it" "Sold".
Thank god for bad movie writers. Disney just keeps on giving.
H hok ami prothom din eksathe these you have received this
Would've been perfect if Ryan wore a cowboy hat while pitching. 😂 (Sorry, Dave Filoni)
B’s in the chat for Beaver
The intire thing is pour gold
0:08 can someone explain
They went Treasure Planet with that map?!  Oh! And nice hair difference there, Ryan and Ryan.
a colossal waste of time
Thansk for this.   I gladly skipped this turd 💩
Can we please appriciate that both guys have different haircuts
The lack of basic thought that hampers this show. It makes me sad.
Hilarious!  But it's almost like punching down at this point.  Movies made by the mentally ill should not be made fun of.  Naaa!  Please keep making fun of them.
Watching this before Ahsoka would've saved me alot of time...
"we need more girls to like star wars, they aren't spending enough money" "aight lets make a incompetent brat and an anxious girl-boss the main characters and have them figure out how to work together because chicks care about relationships over everything"
I mean, unless it's a full on novel, people can punch holes in just about any story. In the end it's how you choose to take in entertainment. Will you be forever dissatisfied because of the opinions of the comment section, and spoof videos? Will you allow yourself to never feel the gratification of entertainment because it's not 10/10 life-changing?   Now reflect on yourself and think about why you might be depressed all the time staring at your dumbass phone and scrolling endlessly. You're searching for something you won't allow yourself to have.
Funny how this series is currently the number one most much SW series. Andor fans:  "viEwErshIp doeSnT matTeR! 😡🤬😭😱" ....😂😂 suuuuuure it doesn't. Kids these days. 😅
It's been cool watching the evolution of Ryan's characters. He also seems like he has really made it financially, he carries himself with more confidence even through the skits of playing different roles.
C***o* M**r** 5**-*1-2***!
WoW
I love the Pitch Meetings, even for content I like, but I wonder if Ryan is still able to enjoy any shows without deconstructing them.
Awesome
"C3PO's cameo explained" - Anthony Daniels has had blackmail material on Star Wars bigwigs since day one.
Ashoka is basically a 13 year-old’s fanfic.
So many haters, the dark side is strong here.
Love this
I don't like Star Wars but I know this is Disney trash and Pitch Meetings are hilarious even when you don't know anything about the movie or TV show.
And why does the blue guy look a little like a blue elong musk.
You can smell it all you want cuz I wouldn't put on watching that dog water. And I would have more fun an a better time with it over this shenanigans
what did the producer guy think when ryan said "we did ahsoka"?
Very good 👍
Honestly, do they really think its a good representation of womens ? 😂 I know probably its just what their daddies ( sponsor) asked them to do regardless the story or agenda . I think its gross and waste of money .. just another way of fancy comedy.
I hope when i grow up i can have Baylans  beard.  I ask all you fellow interet goers to make "great baylans beard" an expression
You know..... That show is so boring i couldn't even laugh and literally dozed off in the middle of your video. Hahaha, not your fault though, i blame Disney.
❤
Indeed, what is with all the ancient secret maps to secret locations where a not so ancient person is hiding Disney?
I wish there was one of these for Andor, just like a mostly-positive pitch meeting
@Disparu I can't believe you watched the whole show when you could have just observed the pitch meeting.
I appreciate the anatomy joke.
Midichlorians might as well be space estrogen.
I had high hopes for the Ahsoka series.  Never followed the animated version...  But then they brought in witches and zombies, and for some reason, Ahsoka seemed to forget 90% of the time that she actually had TWO lightsabers where everyone she fought only had one.  Lightsabers also seem to just bounce off of people most of the time now or getting stabbed through the chest doesn't seem to kill people.  It's almost like they have never watched Star Wars.
God this show was so horrifically bad
"Best beard in the galaxy."  It's the same as his! 🤣
👆
That tibia line cracked me up 🤣🤣
Just when we thought they couldn’t possibly make a show less interesting than the mandalorian. Geez.
I now know what make a good jedi. Being a woman.
Star Wars .....death by suicide
Love how you couldn't keep it together when she stepped out of the ship :)
it had good and bad parts. Most annoying is that the jedi they searched for and this other girl didnt kiss when they meet or even hug really. it was more like yo borther, havent seen you in 10 seconds. also goddam are the stromtroopers incompetent again. and who the fuck is thrawn. i dont even care, all he does is stand around and give useless orders. hes not even winning shit. throws away the lives of his army for shit, then says thats part of the plan?!?! like cmon... then fucking space whales??? gimme a break what is that shit all about. best part was the evil jedi thing they had going on, interesting characters of them 2. also i did somewhat like that ahsokas tricks evolved, like when she cut herself down a floor without having the sabers in hand and.... yea, tahts all i can think of. getting older and getting calmer is fine and all, but the not thinking about a battle plan and just storming in there?! contradictory character development. and the fckin fanservice. fuck fanservice that whole segment with anakin was worthless. and fkcin c3po coming into the room... all of them saying his name like they are on a fan convention. give me a break. in their universe its still a fckin droid after all, not some saint walking around. I did like the first countdown szenaria on the planet the bad guys departed from, but fkcin made all that fight worthless cause space whales. like have they done anything successful? the fckin jedi just get lucky and no failure ever matters. fckin girl gets stabbed. i think okay, a interesting show? ahsoka coping with the death of that girl and maybe her own anger... no. emotionless fanservice compilation fuck that. i could write a ton more. and im gonna fucking do, like im ever finished with talking about this shit. just look at episode 7, it was so boring and effortless that i didnt even go to the cinemas for movie 8 (which was better than 7 at least) and didnt watch movie 9 when i heard that fckin palpatine was back. fckin masked bad guy again and a fckin evil shit being. just the same story again. at least 8 fckin killed the bland bad guy and destroyed the fckin mask. hell yeah, killed that whole shit off. that was why i liked 8. the rest i didnt even care about. andor was fine, some believable story and least and oh fcuking thank god no fanservice and no unkillable characters. prison scenes were cool as well. defo gave a lot of background on the empire and why people wanted to rebell. IT EXPANDED THE UNIVERSE in a good way and not some unnecessary pretty planet. book oif boba? fanservice shit again. mandalorian? meh, interesting idea in start, but fckin end it at season 1 my god. let luke get baby yoda for training and maybe some diff character development for the mandalorian. okay, now im slightly less angry for 5 minutes.
Nice
What about the obnoxious, un-necessarily 3D-animated jedi-training droid? And every costume looking just-out-of-the-box new? Every detail in this series is so lazily depicted you feel no one actually gives a flaming s**t about the outcome. Watching disney's sw is painful both for the stories and for production quality. There's no love, no art and no craft. Only marketing.
Thanks for this, now I dont have to watch it, but at least I know what happens :)
I’ve said it since the show was announced that this is final breaking point for Star Wars. Well Disney, congratulations, you managed to finally break a life long Star Wars fan. Even after the Sequels, Kenobi, Boba Fett and Mando Season 3 I had hope in this show because I love the characters but you fundamentally managed to make one of the best Star Wars villains in history a mustachioed twirling Bond villain. Dammit Lucasfilm.   Great video as always my man.
"Stopping a fart is tight!" Killed me😂😂
I'm so glad I didn't watch this crap.
So glad I didn’t waste my time with this garbage
I'm alright with what Sabine did in this season. It's her Jedi lineage's way. From dooku to qui gon to obi wan to Anakin to ahsoka to Sabine, they were always more emotional and unorthodoxed in their ways and the way they approached a plan of action.
The ahsoka show was all about the Yoda, dooku, qui gon, obi wan, Anakin, ahsoka, Sabine Jedi lineage and legacy. It was meant to demonstrate that this Jedi training and strategies were far from the norm and meant to let the fans know, that these Jedis valued different things, like friendship and were more emotionally concerned and risked their lives in unorthodoxed ways than the typical Jedi would approach a given situation. Sabine risking everything to find Ezra, is in keeping with what this jedi's lineage of Jedi masters gambits.
Starwars is such trash these days.  Im not missing my D+ subscription.  Thanks Disney for working so hard at destroying all of my favorite things from childhood.
I know people say Disney destroyed Star Wars, but...  . . . . . . . . . Never mind, they're right.
WELL OK THEN
First Disney and JJ decide Thrawn is non canon, ro replace his fantastic arc with incredibly dumb stuff. And then they put thrawn, who is now a buffoon, in a random dumb side show... duh...
I can’t believe Disney shils and consoomers gave this bs a 10/10 rate + overwhelming reviews of how Ahsoka will save the franchise
I agree with most of the video, but the fact that Ezra just happened to be close by when he could theoretically be anywhere on the planet could have a rational reason. More than anything, he wants to go home, and the place where Thrawn leaves the planet and his rescuers first arrive is probably the arrival point for some reason. If you're stranded in an alien country, you would stay close to the airport too.
i'm 4 mins in.... wtf is this show? sounds like complete shit and nothing but filler that shits on lore.... a giant space squid? wtf.
Exactly!!!! 😂  say hello to my little friend her name is ........  Asoka she's so cute   Ashoka 💩
Filoni clearly just write stories for children. The whole thing is just so silly and brainless it could only be for young children.
I love that Ryan is dedicated enough to get a haircut between shooting screen writer guy and producer guys lines. Impressive.
Day 90 of letting me do Ahso- ahm ahm, of requesting an arcane pitch meeting
And people say Dave Filoni is some kind of genius??
Every single person in the Star Wars Universe can now just get force powers, if they, you know, want it really really bad.
How come no EXPEND4BLES Pitch Meeting yet!!?? Shocking. I guess it would be too difficult to do?........😊
Ngl this one felt a little too complicated with all the characters. I had a hard time keeping up
Yes, definitely put in some reviews of the time for the older movies. Responding to the it from earlier, but had me cracking out loud, let me get off ah that thing!
Writing was going sideways before the strike, it's like Nothing has changed lol
The  She will lead us right to him. Suggesting Thrawn has been using all his resources to find Ezra to no avail, and then he's 5 minutes away sat on a chair with his feet up in plan sight, was the absolute bottom of Disney Star Wars for me, and that's saying something.
Tibia is now also a funny bone
The show definetely had a lot of issues, but I enjoyed it way more than I thought, as I am weirdly attached to the Rebels characters and was happy to see them again
Actually I was expecting some obvious references like LOTR (Ahsoka wearing white after allegedly being dead --> Gandalf) or GOT (dead bodies revived as soldiers --> night king)...
I stopped watching after the second episode. Glad I did too after watching this.
I loved Ahsoka but these are fair hits across the board 😂
Love love love it work
I never get tired of those 2 degenerates
Good
is it really nostalgia if C3PO appears in literally everything? save for the games ig?
"She's just immediately that good at using the Force?"    Producer guy doesn't understand the Force identifies as female.
What is it with Disney undoing things?  Ezra sacrifices himself to get rid of Thrawn, so we'll just bring Thrawn back because Sabine haz the sadz and misses Ezra.  The Mandalorian goes through 2 seasons of sacrifice to bring baby Yoda to Luke to be trained, but then baby Yoda haz the sadz for an episode of Boba Fett and goes back to Mando.
I like that I can keep up to date on Disney shows without ever having to spend 8 hours watching them.
Best beard in 2 galaxies.
I'm so glad I avoided this garbage
Show is garbage 🗑
My good sir, this entire show was a nostalgic cameo. The Night sisters story is from The Clone Wars so was Ashoka's robot, Huyang. The whole Ezra thing along with Sabine, Hera. The Planet Lothal, the star whales and even Trrawn are from Rebels. Not to mention the flashback to the clone wars where we see Anakin and young Ashoka and also Rex.  The simple fact that this show brings Anakin and Ashoka tohether in live action is enough to send people into a nostalgic frenzy. To hear "Snips" after so long. This entire series was fan service and giaranteed to create ripples cz TCW and Rebels are 2 of the most loved stories from the Galaxy far far away.
Light sabres are supposed to be the ultimate futuristic weapon with a working range of about a metre.  Literally any flintlock pistol 200 years old is going to work better than that. Or even a 0.22 rifle with a telescopic sight working it a football field away from the protagonist is going to be a lot more affective than a light sabre.  Lets face it, the light sabre is right up there in the offensive weapon list next to a board with a nail in it.  (Except that the board doesn't need batteries)
Hey Ryan! Loved the pitch meeting as usual. How about a pitch meeting for Demolition Man?
Will you do the pitch of the creator ? There's potentially a ton of "super easy ..."
"Tickled by a lightsaber". They sure don't make them like they used to.
Ashoka does suck from beginning to end. Poorly written, paced and directed. Far to feministic & agenda driven pandering for me.
Spot. On.
This is retarded.
Where. Is. The. Pitch. Meeting. For. Across the Spiderverse?
Actually Ryan, um, Ezra Bridger did it in Star Wars Rebels with Space Whales, and Sabine could've told Ahsoka what Ezra did in Rebels
wonderful information video thanks
I just paid 17$ for a month of Disney to watch them all and im already regretting it. She never does anything but stand like a statue same face every scene 😂 ughh and for f sake there's like one white guy who's old and bad like this show is a steaming woke pile of boring trash I am actually mad I can't get my 17$ back
do you ever put your bloopers up?
We're never gonna get Star Wars at It's most badass and gritty potential. Just tons of purple hair ladies, wack fight choreography and no direction whatsoever.
I’m almost positive that red flame looking thing in the background is stolen
This video has more likes then Ashoka had views lmao
Did Ahsoka keep the sword?
I appreciate you and thank you for making content.
did i miss the "whoopsie"?
Does this mean ScreenRant isn’t shilling for Disney owned LucasFilm so hard anymore?
Thank you for calling out so many things that bothered me about this show 😂 also, when Sabine steals the map for no good reason, putting the galaxy in danger because she didn’t want to be bothered to study it on Ahsoka’s ship really bugged me. Sabine didn’t get called out for it, everyone’s like, jeez Ahsoka lighten up
Wow.  You saved me soooo much time watching this show.
Pitch Meeting.  Ryan, I just saw the Five Nights At Freddy's movie. Please do a review on it.
"For a swim?" "For a death." "Oh no." Best reaction.
This is a must to show all those Disney Starwars fans, that scream at you you hate the show because she is a woman......no mate, just watch this video :p
Sabine: went from artistic all-can-do strong woman in Rebels to artistic all-can-do strong woman in Ahsoka. Yep, another Mary sue.
“Tibia person” that one got me 😂
Well, so far, the Internet hasn't lied. It's Shit.
I didnt eve watched the show, only the Disparu videos
Using the entire first season of a show to ret con the ending of another show is very stupid and very Disney
Don't think I didn't catch that tibia/shin joke. Comedy gold.
After one watches this video, one can go from 8/10 on IMdB to 1/10 after...
I love these type of jokes " All the storm troopers forget that they're holding guns!"  "So after she's TICKLED by a light Saber...."😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
this was season 5 of Rebels, and nothing else. like it was made SPECIFICALLY for fans of the show which was... you know a choice. the target audience are peopoe in their 30s and 40s who grew up watching  clone wars and rebels... BUT as a huge fan of rebels i was happy with what we got. it wasn't pure nostalgia but it was heavy on the rebels references (ezra dressing up as a storm trooper was fucking hilarious as he did that ALL the time in the cartoon). overall it was a fine show, but one that only rebels fans could really get into. a love letter to us i guess.
Was very fun to argue with a redditor about Ahsoka choosing to jump from her ship far away from the people she wants to save, just to run away from a fight she didn't have to be in bc it was wasting her time...
Thank you for saving me time.
Name Ahsoka was inspired by Bharat empreror Ashoka, pronounced Uh-shoka. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka
Man I liked the show lol but now……………..thanks dude lol
Nailed it
So, when will Morgan be eventually resurrected.
I saw a picture of Ryan today and I thought it looked weird not because there was anything just that something about it was different.  Then it hit me, I could see his legs, I’ve never even thought about how he has legs because I've  just never see them.
👍
Nice
So I guess there aren't any penis jokes about how the star destroyer was docked to the planet.
Super easy barely an inconvenience!!!
"stopping a fart is tight"😂
The different haircuts see giving me the vibe that your budget has been increased. Finally getting your well-deserved recognition brother ✊🏾😂
No I understand why I switched it off after watching first 10min....
Nobody dies. But Gandalf the White.  Wow this sounds super stupid.
Can you do a pitch meeting for 300 the sequel pls
I love the almost-laugh when describing Ahsoka getting out of the ship to swipe at the pew-pews. 😂
because grrrl pwrrrr
It's a good thing the timer on those self destruct droids was proportional to the distance Ahsoka would need to get out of harms way, otherwise this show would've been over immediately.
That tibia joke is underrated xD.
Well you cant please someone who enjoys tearing movies apart rather than just enjoying something new, i doubt they could enjoy anything anymore without nitpicking it to death
shin- tibia 😂😂
God that series was garbage
Of course! My name is Phi- wait a second~ Hahaha, you almost got me!
Content for the sake of content….perfect description of everything from Disney
Name: Ryan George ssn: 5318008
hhahahahahahahah SO TRUE. I love how he dissects movie's so well.
I loved Ahsoka. But this is hilarious
"So, you have a new idea for me?"  "No sir, i don't!"  "Great! Lets give it an 6-8 episode mini-series"  Every Disney Pitch meeting
Normally I'm like "oh no they didn't mention -insert small detail-." Butttt... this 6 minute video had it all 🫠
I'm so grateful that Ryan watches this 'content for the sake of content' (read crap) so I don't have to.
Who is this Tibia? Shin What did I say, lol that's gotta become another catchphrase
Ticking lightsabers sure are not tight.
Nice to finally see that Ryan knows he can differentiate Producer Guy and Writer Guy just by trimming some hair.
But... Thrawn was NEVER in another galaxy!  Before he briefly took over the Empire he was stationed in the Unknown Regions where the rest of the Chiss hang out.  Definitely part of the same galaxy where all previous star wars stories take place.    In fact, if I remember correctly, the only attempt to leave the galaxy I'm aware of was a failure.
I've noticed there's no Andor pitch meeting, is that because it's actually a decent show 😂
So sad the actor playing Baylon passed. He was amazing
Thrawn is the kind of villain where a "secret map" to him should be a lethal trap.
Aah dang... really points out all the flaws well
Wasnt that the map to treasure planet
"Spoilers ahead" ohhhh noooo i won't be able to watch Ahsoka now ahhhhhhh what a tragedy
I never understood how the three mothers did not realize Ezra was on board
lol that's right, this whole show was just about Ahsoka and Sabine switching place with Thrawn and Ezra
Ryan you have no idea how much time and money you have saved me
Congratz Disney you killed star wars, ruined my two favorite characters in star wars besides mara jade.. You ruined thrawn, you ruined ahsoka... Star wars is now dead to me *sighs* I will keep the books close to my heart. The books are so much better.. I gotta give Ryan this, He nailed that one for real. lol he literally hit the nail on the head with ahsoka it really was this lol
Funny how a light saber can cut through and destroy a whole ship, but only “tickles” human flesh. 😵‍💫🤦🏽‍♀️
Rubbish show
Soooo.... Is like anything Disney does nowadays just pure donkey crap? Does anyone working there have any kind of intelligence left or do they just snort money all day and pat themselves on the back while the world laughs at their stupidity and complete uselessness?
That pretty much sums up the show 🤣
Truly a terrible show 😂
The only good thing to come out of woke shows like that are these videos
Idk if you have merch, but can you please make a, "barely an inconvenience" shirt please? It' so funny and you say it in like every video. lol
More star wars content I probably won't watch!
We need a class action lawsuit Against Disney For destroying ALL of our childhoods
“Let’s make something so terrible that the fans can’t help but like it”
Hi Ryan, big fan. Please do watch "Leo" indian movie and review it.
And she was a good friend
just fuckin let star wars die already... how much more can you destroy the franchise, disney?
"Ahsoka" reminds me of the work of Shakespeare. Specifically, it reminds me of when he said "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
Pitch the newest total recall.🫡🫡🫡
That's exactly what i said. Sabine let a War start again, just for the sake of one person.  Apparently she never listened to Spock ( the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few}
The pitcher and the exec having different haircuts really took me out of it...😂
I have Ryan can destroy a show by simply describing what happens
Star Wars pitch meetings should start like: - So, do you have a new idea? - No, sir, I don't...
Are you going to do One Piece live action?
I would love to see you do pitches for the saw movie's
In a galaxy far, far away Star Wars use to be good.
This show looks like utter garbage
The dedication of Ryan for cutting and regrowing his hair between each line is impressive.
Sounds awful, thank god I don't have to watch it now.
Can u make pitch meeting of star vs forces of evil
as soon as I noticed ahsoka was folding her arms over and over again the first thing I thought was " thats going to be in pitch meeting"
Actually liked the show a lot, but hilariously fair criticisms as always 😂
Where are the spy kids pitch meeting?
Good thing I didn't watch this train wreck...
'Bad guys love having secret maps that lead to them.' LMAO
How is there a pitch meeting for Ahsoka and not for Andor? Where’s the pitch for Andor?
Some intern pokes their head though the door. "Hey isnt this just the plot to treasure planet, with a magic golden starmap ball?"
If closely watch the haircuts, we surely see those are entirely different human beings 😅
Hollywood should have Ryan on set for every movie.
Nice
Modern tv is trash
disney completely destroyed starwars, made it into a pathetic kids tv shows. that's such a shame
Theres this scene in the second season of Loki, episode 1, that is oddly familiar to your skits.
Nice
Star War RIP
You should do the movie Strays
You never disappoint Ryan! This one was so dead accurate.
You realize this video has better plot than the stupid show it’s describing 🥰
Ahsoka: Ahsoka? Yes... that was what they used to call me. Ahsoka the Grey. That was my name.  Ahsoka: I am Ahsoka the White. And I come back to you now - at the turn of the tide.
Y'all should do a pitch meeting for Labyrinth or Superman 1978
Reasons why I can’t get into all these shows. If Star Wars was a cow it would be skin and bone from how much they try to milk the name for lazy content.
Damn, this looks dumb as shit with bad 90s CGI.
What's it like having 2 first names, Producer and Guy?
Will you do one for shutter island???
Ryan totally had his hair cut between shooting Screenwriter guy and Producer guy
MAdre it sound even more ridiculously garbage.
I can't believe you had to suffer through thus entire awful series to make this pitch meeting just for us to be able to avoid this entire awful series just so we could watch your excellent pitch meeting.  Props.
Producer Guy: "Sooo you have a new idea for a show?" Screenwriter Guy: " No sir I don't, but I figured we'd just, you know, throw a whole bunch of old ideas in a blender and see what bland gooey mess comes out of it."
Im high af and this dude here keeps deleting my comments 😂😂😂
STUPID!
I was wondering if you would notice that Balon's plan appears to have been to make a giant statue of himself in a funny hat, and while the results are pretty impressive, I can't help wondering if it was really that urgent. Slave to his art I guess
Going to watch Andor again
CONSOOM
Due for a BIG ploppin’
George Lucas created Skywalker Ranch.   Disney created Contentberry Farm.
I’ve followed along with Star Wars as long as I could. I got into Ben’s and Boba’s shows. But now all this was was “name meets name and goes to place to find name and go to place and uses thing to get to place but name is already there and name fights name at place until name goes to place. STORMTROOPERS!!! Then name and name and name and name and name and yeah win.”
Star Wars man. The most under thought writing at every fucking point
All of the modern Star Wars series make the sequel trilogy seem good.
We live in the golden age of bad YouTube reviews 😂
Best show ever say disney despite having lowest viewership
Producer Guy's choice of descriptives is GodTier😂
Yeah, utterly garbage writing. I found myself shouting at the TV in frustration. So fecking stupid.
Easy way to fix the whales somehow leading her where she needs to go: show her having a vision from the force that depicts them arriving at the place she needs to go, and have her find the whales after
Purple hair = shit movie
Best beard in the galaxy 🤣🤣😂😂🤣
Wait nobody told me Ahsoka straight up rips off Treasure Planet’s device
Stopping a fart is tight. Air tight
.
Please don't get an haircut in an middle of filming an video... lol. It's confusing.  Great job on this one, this show was so empty...you didn't even mentioned Hera plot and nothing is missing from the story.
It really was bad writing. The worst is Sabine being Jedi.
She learns after a whole day in the the world between worlds to learn its better to live than to die. HAHAHAHAA
i guess this channel is proof that something good can come from all the garbage that disney keeps putting out.
To quote Metallica: sad but true
I finished the shitty show solely because I wanted the best experience of this pitch meeting.
Hi, Can you do one for ONE PIECE also, Thanks!!!
What is disney starwars obsession with badguy maps
Lol agree with the pitch. Terrible series
All the good characters just stand around smirking all the time. It's literally all they do. It's so awkward
"Barely an inconvenience" Forever my favorite line 😂
I just realized you still haven’t made an andor pitch meeting😑😑
Technically Baylan has the best beard in two galaxies 😅
Who is this Tibia person? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Why does Disney insist on proving again and again to me that cancelling my subscription to their platform was the best choice I made last year?
I think that all shows on Disney are writen by chat gpt
That Tibia/Shin joke should not have made me laugh so hard
Glad he mocked the lack of death-by-impaling, but why hasn't anyone mentioned that TWO characters were instantly killed by being slashed in the stomach - a decidedly non-lethal injury?
As a hairdresser, I appreciate the two haircuts lol
huh, is that the map from treasure planet?
Ashoka. Asucker more like
damn good one... the last ID joke was perfect :D
Good 👍
Magical girl powers PLUS the force = Infinity powers. It's called Kennedy's second rule. It explains a lot of the issues Ryan is addressing.
Who was calling you at 4:40?
If you are one of those peeps who enjoyed the show...good for you. I m not one of those people.
Seriously tho, why does every disney starwars bbeg have an ancient artifact-like map that leads directly to them
1:54 thats definitely an off camera chuckle when he mentions the ridiculous ass scene of ahsoka fighting ships..
We went from "I yearned to be a savior against Injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet" to randomly crossing arms
the best BEARD in the galaxy. thats tighty
Tibia...hilarious
Star hers.
With the exception of Rogue One and Andor Disney Start Wars is totally forgettable. Ashoka is no different.
This was tight as always. I canceled disney plus after watching this shitshow.
Wait what?  Somebody survived by getting stabbed by a lightsaber?  WTF?! That is such an insult to the franchise, Nobody can survive deep cuts or literal stab wounds caused by a lightsaber.
Hilarious
Stealing Farscape's Space Whales' is barely an inconvenience......Moya....Talyn
Why is Ryan so pale in this video?
Missing one for the Peacemaker series.
“Ploppin’” ❤
I am glad other people are seeing right through this garbage.  Why did Lucas have to sell!
Elon thrawn.
Please do MCU phase 4 and 5 pitch meeting
Boy...he got fat
I’m hoping that with bigger writer rooms, future seasons will be better
Since you're doing Ahsoka, will you also be doing one piece, another notable series right now?
"She learns that it's better to live than to die." Ladies and gentlemen, our next generation of screen writers...
Re-watching Pitch Meetings, then coming across a new episode is tight!
It'd be really fun to do a soaker.
Its like he was actually in the room for the pitch
I watched episode 1 and am heavily debating on not watching any of it and just watching this and "things you missed" videos instead.  Andor ruined me. Season 2 can't come soon enough.
Rob Zombies Halloween 1 and 2!
Thumbs
Disney needs to hire this guy to read their scripts before shooting and then create this video for them to watch before giving things the green light 🤡
I didn't watch the show and my expectations for new SW are low but for the sake of my mental health I'm going to believe this is extremely exaggerated and the show isn't this bad.
Can we just acknowledge the biggest crime of this show? If you take Ahsoka out of this story, not that much changes. Thrawns robots would have still found the map. They probably would have figured out how to open it. And they would have got him back at which point the Republic would have pulled their heads out of the sand and acknowledged he's returned. The only difference is Ezra who seems like he could have easily stowed away on the ship on the way back and who admittedly is going to give the Republic a heads up that Thrawns' back. Which given their track record, the Republic still won't believe it.. And even if we acknowledge that Ezra coming back is because of Ahsoka's actions, it's more because of Sabine's actions.  I cannot believe I predicted this was going to happen when they announced this show two years ago. If a show is named after a specific character in Star Wars, that is now a dead guarantee that the show won't actually be about them
This one’s sanity must have already crumbled
Thank you, I didn't want to renew my Disney subscription. Now I know I'm not missing anything.
unpopular opinion, Ashoka wasn't bad, it was just mid and people are just hating for no reason, it is difficult to make a 9/10 series, let me remind you people that shows like She-Hulk exist, the show was more like an OAV than an actual series but it wasn't that bad
Very funny👏🏿
The Zombie stormtroopers ... well, enough said.
Wow that show sounds terrible!
Man, what kind of Kingdom Hearts level plot nonsense was this
If you've never watched Star Wars Rebels, you have no idea what's going on in this show
Ahsoka=pile of garbage
I love the fact that Sabine and Ezra are surrounded by Stormtroopers.  Shin Hatti orders the troopers to kill the two. Ezra then put his hands up and shouts *"Wait, let's talk"*    *And the Troopers actually hold their fire!?*  Shin Hatti literally has to order them a second time to kill them before they actually start shooting.
Disney signed up for that pitch? Yeah.. it was easy, barely an inconvenience
I liked the show, but it was definitely slow in the first half.
I love the small break at 1:53 After all the ridiculous shit ryan has had to describe through the years Ahsoka fighting ships in space with her lightsaber takes the cake
they literally stole the trasure map from treasure planet. Wtf
Do Fight Club next.
Basic but the fart joker 🤣
I lost interest on Disney properties a long time ago. I watched first season of Mando, but that's it. Didn't even watch the MCU stuff, and I got Disney+ for free even.. I want to watch Ahsoka, but somehow after disappointment of the last star wars trilogy, made me feel that Ahsoka is going in the same direction.... And apparently I was right.
Thanks for the pitch meeting, now don't have to waste time watching this "Disney" show
Lightsabers are now useless, but only against the "good guys". Well, a few more kicks to the dead horse that is Disney's Star Wars won't make much of a difference at this point.
Please, PLEASE do Carrie (definitely any and ALL versions would be great!). Or like, Titanic. Or Final Destination, The Exorcist, Happy Death Day, Camp Nowhere, Ernest Goes To Camp (or literally any other “Ernest does something” movie.), The Green Mile, The Shining, Childs Play, M3gan, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Freddy Vs Jason or like, literally any movie that’s ever been on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 would suffice.   I feel like I’ve given you quite a few options, perhaps you could work on at least one of them, please 🥺?
Stuffing a fart is tight... A sentence I never thought to ever hear 😅
1st off, it does make sense that if the Droid were defeated they would blow up to destroy the map so that the person who beat them can't have it. 2 if you were stabed in one of a couple certain areas by a lightsabre you would be fine because it wouldn't hit vital organs and immediately cautarize the wound. So HAHA YOU SUCK 😂
God that show is flaming garbage.  🗑
Did Ryan get a haircut in between filming screenwriter guy and producer guy????
How bad is Ahsoka? The Pitch Meeting is a better version. Really.
She knew the purgil (space whales) would get her there because they are the ones who took Ezra and Thrawn there to begin with. Ezra wearing the full suit is something he did frequently in Rebels as he collected the helmets and frequently disguised himself as various troopers
Nice One Ryan! I love that you can't even take the show seriously hypothetically, 1:51 yeah I noticed you fabulous bastard!
Im so glad they stopped making any starwars content after making the prequals.  Could you imagine just how screwed up it would become if rhey didnt?
The TV shows are so stupid and boring that even the Pitch meeting doesn't look funny anymore. And in think that's sad.
Sorry, nothing against you, but i honestly couldn't finish this. Ahsoka is that bad.
The fact that you have to tell people DON'T DO THAT is what is SO SO very wrong today 🤣
pitch meetings for videogames would be TIGHT
Ryan we need a rocky pitch
Star Wars and marvel are junk food. Lots of it, but is just bad
Don’t forget about Star Wars universe finally passing the bechdel test but making up for it by framing EVERY woman’s booty into as many shots as possible 🙄😅
This is a bit off-topic for this channel, but in past months I couldn't help but picture how a pitch meeting "conquering Ukraine in a special military operation"  would look like. Imagine when writer guy (Shoigu) comes convincing producer guy (Vladi) of the brilliant plot. Super easy - barely an inconvenience.
Just started watching these and it's scary how real they seems to be. This is exactly how i could imagine someone making all these dumb decision to give us all this crap. But i have to give credit when it's due and it's really great these companies willingly lose bilions of dollars just so we can have good time watching youtube vidoes like this.
Im completely justified in not having watched a single episode. If they were willing to ruin a legends character central story like Obi Wan Kenobi, what bulletless gun is Ahsoka having for a shot?
Oh boy, not particularly!
"Ahsoka" accomplished something I thought was impossible:  made me care even less about disneystarwars (not to be confused with the brillant, beloved, seminal franchise "Star Wars").  And I didn't even have to watch the show, just a few reviews and related piss takes like this Pitch Meeting.
Glad to see the getting stabbed by a light saber is barely a wounded but wish it was followed by being slashed by a light saber is instant death.
“So Sabine is dead?” “What no she was just impaled with a light saber” me: …so she’s dead then😂
Well, it was a mess - but it was a fun mess! It did have an “evil” George Clooney, though.😉
So the entire show is one big character assassination of Ezra, Sabine, AND Ashoka (because we all know that their animated counterparts would never risk the safety of the galaxy, even if it meant finding each other, Ezra literally took himself out for the specific purpose of taking Thrawn with him at the end of Rebels).
No lie, I could buy this being the way that pitch meeting went down!
I don’t know why I feel that I would have like this more if it was animated, it’s still a continuation of the story of Rebels and I think the actors did a great job but it still feels like it would have worked better animated
This was a million times better than the show.
Impressively bad honestly
Yup. I enjoyed it. Now I don't have to watch this train wreck.  Heir to the Empire is an amazing trilogy (at least I thought so when I read it in my teens) and would have made a much beter sequel trilogy than the garbage that Disney pumped out..... but it's not heavy on Jedi.... because Jedi are really quite boring..... and it has an interesting and nuanced bad guy.... and strong female leads that actually have to put in a bit of effort to get anything done, so nothing that Disney would have liked.
Love the Tibia joke! Have you thought about a Pitch Meeting for the show "Supernatural"?
They sure do know how to ruin starwars lol, god it sucks SO much.
I love how the ad they picked for this was for Disney+
I thought the show was great, with its kinda slow Japanese vibe. Looking forward for the second season.
Is it bad that upon seeing the space whales, I immediately thought "Oh here's the Super easy, Barely an inconvenience" ? It's the most Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience in the history of Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience.
The next Pitch meeting you should do is  Beastly 2012 film
Gave up after the first snooze episode. So glad i watched this summary instead 😂 Jfk what a ridiculous plot
These videos are so good, they should be they should be name humanity's heritage along with French food and biosphere reserves. They do encapsulate all of humanity's... humanity.
Barely an inconvenience!
I want Ryan to keep producing this stuff forever. It really cheers me up after a hard day at work.  He's comedy gold.
Sabine has a massive hickey when theyre in the slow pod with Ezra lol
So glad I didn't waste my time on this show. Star Wars is dead. Lucas/Disney waited nearly 30 years to tap into Thrawn, one of the best villians, then fucks it up.
HE SAID THE THING!
Great writing my man!
Meanwhile in the force Quigon is pissed that you can actually survive a lightsaber to the chest
How far star wars has fallen. Thanks disney. I hate you 😡
Ahsoka is so bad I'm disappointed in the Pitch Meeting; but then I remember Ryan has the best beard in (this) galaxy ^_^
space whale i think might even be in some books of star wars.
So that i the story of Ashoka? It's worse than I expected...
wow monster
Awesome as ever!!
Admiral Thrawn, quite honestly the greatest tactician the galaxy has ever seen. Not like you’d pick up on that watching Ahsoka. Damn shame they turned him into blue Elon Musk.
Your points 'might' be valid, but like don't ruin my fun! 😂  Enjoyable as usual George Ryan
Dunno why they're calling shows what they are, BOBA FETT, Staring everyone but boba fett. Ahsoka, staring everyone from Starwars Rebels now in Live action.... Had fuckall to do with any of them
How can someone stand in the vacuuming of space and destroy attacking ships with a three foot lightsaber. Is that somehow canon now? It seems. . . really dumb.

Brilliant as usual! Kept waiting for the name drop on Finding Nemo, since Ahsoka's plan to get in a whale and hope for the best was just like Dory's.
Social security number😆
Amazing breakdown as always🔥
"Content for the sake of content" is Disney's first name nowadays 😂
To be fair to the series, a lot of the background and motivation for the characters were developed in the show Rebels.....
Shirley it can’t be that bad?
Yeah, I gave up after Ben Kenobi, I fell asleep when Obi-Wan and Vader fought. I heard boss girl show was mid and now I know. lol
Did anyone watch this show?
There are at least two generations who didn't watch all the cartoons and the wierd cgi stuff on childrens tv because they were at work providing.  This is for generation Y who are now in the workforce and generation Z also has no idea what's going on as they start to enter the workforce.
Treasure Planet 2 looking interesting
I’m starting to think Disney was secretly working with Ryan, so they made the show terrible so that the Pitch Meeting would be even funnier.
AssWoka
The Mummy (1999) - Pitch meeting
"You slap some nostalgia on it"  I mean: They have been doing that since The Phantom Menace, why stop now? Not like Star Wars fans seem to dislike it.
I wish they made another season of rebels instead of Assoka.
Yea.. i knew watching this show would make me hate star wars. Glad I didn’t watch this bs.
Ryan, I was expecting at the end the producer would say “Wow, wow, wow that sounds like a great FIRST episode” bc the show only had about one episodes worth of story and they stretched it out to a season.
I loved ashoka but I LOVE this pitch meeting lol
As an Ahsoka fan, I am triggered.
Calling shin tibia is peak genius 😂
they had to dumb everyone down so that they wouldn't have to work as hard to make Thrawn smart
Being stoic and murky throughout the entirety of a series is tight
If I had to describe Disney's Star Wars plots using only one word, I'd chose _pointless_
-So what's Ahsoka's personality? -Oh she doesn't have one
Tibia person 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
a Disney Executive must've used an AI to generate the plot of Ahsoka, because this crap made no sense and no purpose.
Heres my pitch for current star wars shows; wipe my ass on office paper, so does it look like a hit?
Where's the Andor pitch meeting?
I love the way you money!
Yep, that's how it felt by the end. A whole bunch of nothin'
Now I haven’t seen this but if thrown is actually in another galaxy, wtf man, that’s just so lame, there’s all this cool dark side/deadly stuff at the edge of the galaxy and then they just conveniently have a ring that can take them to another galaxy something NOONE in the cannon has been able to do and it’s just a grass plane, no yujang vang or anything. It’s just so disappointing that it’s just a ring, they didn’t even need some ancient dark side technology like the star forge (of course not the actual one but something similar) or anything
And you can see how little Hera meant to this story she wasn't even mentioned.
His characters have different haircuts! 😳
Am I the only one that thinks Thrawn looks like Elon Musk?
Please do that to Loki because no one said anything about her unleashing kang and she immediately blamed Loki for the things he did sad sad Disney..
So I grew up with the prequel movies which I enjoyed as a kid but then swiftly forgot about as I got older. Then I stumbled across Clone Wars when it was on Netflix years ago and it completely changed how I felt about these characters. Anakin is actually incredibly likeable and you get to see more of a gradual progression towards his fall to dark side compared to the whiplash we get in the movies (RIP Jedi kiddies). In Clone Wars the emotional pay-offs are so well done in comparison to the movies. I balled my eyes out watching that final episode and a number of times throughout the show... Never cried or cared much about anything during the movies (sorry Jedi kiddies). Ultimately Clone Wars is about Ahsoka's journey though and despite initial impressions of her in the earlier episodes, she gradually grew to become one of my favorite Star Wars characters ever... Eh yeah, so that's over now. Thanks Disney. Nah I'm kidding, I'm just gonna pretend this Ahsoka series doesn't exist. It's actually pretty easy to do, I've been pretending that 'check engine' light in my car doesn't exist for ages now. It's been working out just fine for me so far 🤪
Please do exorcist believer next!
Spoilers ahead lol - this (and Mr Sunday Movies) is the only way I’ll watch what I knew would be a steaming pile of garbage.  Spoil away!
I feel for you Han Solo, they did you dirty.   "No no no she was just impaled with a lightsaber why would that,...... is that not bad?...  not anymore no that's meaningless she's up and at him in the next episode"
what a stupid and useless show.... you actually made it better... lmao
I was so sure that Sabine being stabbed by a lightsaber would get "barely an inconvenience". But nooo. Spacewhales got it instead.  I just love that people surviving being stabbed by lightsabers no longer even deserves that comment. xD   Imo, Sabine got way to much heat.  Yes, she did stupid things, stupid choices, stupid things for the plot.  But for me, it is ok to pick the wrong decision, if it is true to her character.  And after long discussion in youtubecomments, it is actually true that Sabine wouldn't share when SHE fucked up. She is fast to make fun of other fucking up, but not her.  I also did like that she became so good with the force to pull the lightsaber. But did NOT like force pushing Ezra.   Overall. Ahsoka is a 6/10 show for me.  It was fine, it was ok. But not good enough. And for starwars to be good, they need to make another mandolorian season 2. I sadly believe they will fail.
Please do a pitch meeting on  futurama
So you don’t mention anything to do with Hera or Jason or the world between world or huyang or chopper you know you cut out a lot of the show
Let us take a moment to recognise the ridiculous outfit of the producer.
Man, even the Pitch Meeting for this garbage heap was boring.
Was waiting for this episode so I didn't have to watch the series
The new star wars are stupid heroes fighting even more stupid villains.
2:01 they forget they're holding guns... Intriguing.
God damn, just point out how they flanderizing every single character why don’t ya. Very nice.
Ahsoka was pretty disappointing
You missed an amazing opportunity at a joke there... "Sabine is just immediately that good at using the Force?" "Yup, because she has a Space-vagina." "Space-Vagina's are TIGHT!" 😛
Andor made a single stormtrooper or a single TIE fighter terrifying
I’d love to meet the two drunk autistic thirteen year olds who wrote Asoka. They must be very clever people.
Hilarious 🤣
I knew writer guy and producer guy were 2 different people! They don't even have the same haircut!
Romans 6:23 NLT   “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
i truly just dont understand anymore how these pitch meetings are even possible in real life, these videos reminds me that these conversations partially ACTUALLY happened xD
the whale thing was explained in rebels
Yes, stopping a fart IS tight!
Good grief.  Ryan doing the job of describing "entertainment for dummies."  If consumers will eat turds, that's what is gonna get sold.
This show is a giant woke piece of crap!
why is this Star Wars show so bad? Also points for simply listing what’s happens in the show and that being funny
A show with 99% female cast for no reason
*Smurfy Blue Guy.
You could probably go to Hollywood with your reputation and become a script doctor
This is exactly right😂😂😂😂 wth was Disney thinking
But... but... this is the show that's going to save Disney Star Wars!
I wish you would make pitch meeting for Van Helsing movie from 2004.
Disney star wars fans would lap up any old shite these days
I’ve been living under a rock, incredible stuff! I’m subscribed
Growing such a magnificent beard is Super hard, extremely inconvenient.
You nailed it to the ground 😂
I tilt my head every time he says "barely an inconvenience" in these videos 😂
Hehe 😂  Joe Momma SSN:   123456789
Another pitch meeting that's way more entertaining than the show/film it's about!
god star wars is stupid and ppl love it.  what does that say?   Not talking abt the first 3 star wars just every single star wars after that except maybe rogue one which as far as I know is the only star wars without cute critters.
WARNING : Do not attempt to drink fluids while watching this video without risking expelling such liquids from both mouth and nose due to uncontrolled laughter. (almost happened to me 1:14 seconds into the video regarding light saber surgery being available on galactic Medicare).
😂😂😂
No mention of the Doctor who robot?
pretty much yeah,
To say it was like bad tumblr fan fiction would be an insult to tumblr fan fiction
..oh no..
👍🏻
Odd that hiring activists instead of writers isnt working
Not really a pitch meeting just a long recap
You’ve really gotta be absolutely brain dead to think this show is passable. If you know the world, it’s insulting. And if you don’t, it’s confusing and dull.
👍
why is it so bright?
this guy has saved me so much money and time from having to watch all these shows and movies. literally saving lives here
People still watch this crap channel?
Ryan just has a more  eloquent way of saying Asoka sucks.
What a mess
I hear being tight is fundamental in stopping a fart.
Excellent Ryan as always, even up to the outro. Covered all the major flaws right down to the summary of the series at the end
The second guy looks bored listening to pitch guy pitch for Ahsoka. 🤣
Well nice to see that SW isn’t getting any better.
why is everyone in this damn series a freaking force user?
All of Star Wars was in a galaxy far far away. It was never in multiple galaxies until Disney started destroying Star Wars.
You know usually Ryan can find bad points of a plot that didn't bother me, but for Ashoka everything he points out pissed me off while watching the show. Lightsaber that doesn't wound, Sabine who quickly use the force, bad reunion with Ezra and so much more... 😔
I've never really liked Ahsoka, personally; she was rather transparently a way to get a "strong girl character" into the male-dominated cast, and she wasn't mentioned _at all_ in the movies (that is, Anakin was never mentioned as having had a padawan of any kind). How long will it be before we stop forcing "strong female characters" into everything, and accept that sometimes an all-male cast is just fine?
I think the writers for all the Star Wars universe shows, movies etc., should have to stay on strike until the end of time! What a bunch of hot garbage!
This is so much more entertaining than the actual show
Who is writing Star Wars these days, and can we have them transported to that other galaxy?
Lightsabers and having force powers means nothing anymore
“It’s better to live, than to die.” Is the peak Disney writing we need
I gave this show a 6 on imdb, this guy made me go back and lower it to 5 lmao.
lol What a stupid damn show. I laughed constantly, and it's not even meant to be a comedy.   NOBODY DIES FROM LIGHTSABERS ANYMORE?!?! WTF!
I am so happy I watched this instead of Ahsoka.
So glad he addressed how Disney is presenting lightsabers
Wow...this is dumber than I expected.
Kill a fart 😆 🤣
I liked Asoka. I thought it was good. The whales returning was awesome to see, and they do explain all of these nit picks on the show.
It was season 5 of Rebels and I liked it.
how about  nooooooo haail no!!! i gave you 1 sec on the video and way to many seconds of your adds... i know you will call me rascicst  and i for once do not care... go away toether with youtube adds and noboidy will cry when you will go away!
"Getting a haircut for reverse roll is TIGHT"
I couldn't stand the first half of the series, it felt like the story was only advancing because of Sabine's awful decisions, but quite enjoyed the last few episodes.
You should have also mentioned that last teaser at the end of the last episode because that is huge for the live action universe
The thing I hate most about the map is a petty complaint but... they copied Treasure Planet. It's the same type of map and the unlock sequence is the same as Treasure Planet
Just love it how he trashes the Ahsoka series in 6:30m. It could have been much shorter, but surely not so funny; and reaffirming how crappy the series, plot, acting, writing really are. Worst SW series since the book of bobba fett - or at the same level. It really made me miss Ahsoka in the clone wars, that it did. Rebels are also a childish piece of crap, so bah for the in the flesh version of some characters. Baylan is the best almost doing nothing - including in acting (RIP), Merrin after all is not the only survivor of the Dothomirian nightsisters (how many canons Disney SW have?), the Thrawn from the Thrawn trilogy and even Rebels would have snapped his own neck if he watched what he was turned over in this god forsaken series. It seems it's now clear Kath Kennedy was not the only problem and rotten apple inside Disney's Lucasfilms, what a surprise... (can we have back Lucas??? the prequel movies seem like Oscar material compared to this stuff...). Great and very intelligent video.
I was having a bad day. Then I got a notification  Ryan uploaded a video. Now I'm happy again
Unrealistic, the guy pitching needs a cowboy hat
So glad Ryan calls out the bad writing in these overrated and dragged out movies or shows and is funny about it too, but for Ryan George it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Asoka is an L
Those striking writers definitely deserved that pay raise.....
“So you have a new idea for me?” “No. Not really.” “Oh.”  Video over.
Hollup, did Ryan get a haircut just to make producer look more different from writer hack
"She dies, then comes back wearing white." Gandalf:
Ashoka was a huge let down. The light saber combat was crappy. I rewatched clone wars season 7 and that version of Ashoka would have wiped the floor with everyone. They dumbed Ashoka down. Way down.
Disney: "We're celebrating a 100 years!" Also Disney: *eats itself*
I gotta be honest. Bobba fett was more enjoyable
Good take on it. Nailed it.
I've never been a huge Star Wars fan, but thanks for letting me know just how execrable it's become thanks to Disney's naked greed.
Ew
😂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Awesome sign-off!
Thank you for calling out this utter abomination of an excuse for a show.
The Obi-Wan backlash meant nothing for them?? Because a lot of this sounds like it Well, meant to wait till the full season is done, and lost all my interest by then Maybe I will pick it up one day, maybe not
Good
no gonna lie, only one episode in ahsoka managed to be any good.
No surprise this sounds as dumb & awful as every Star Wars (bar Rogue One & Andor) since 1981.
The force is female 🤪
Thank you for skewering Sabine's quick recovery from becoming a lightsaber shish kebab.
The Farce Awakens... again!
Honestly if thrawn is the one that helps with the rise of the first order then sabine has fucked over the galaxy more then any other hero besides anakin
This is my kind of criticism. You will always be my favorite.
Wow, this show is so bad that it doesn't even come off as interesting or funny in a Pitch Meeting.  Disney needs to stop making content or fire all of their employees and start their studio from scratch.
You're amazing at what you do and i hope you keep doing it, with all the stuff and the movies...
This show was 1:36
I stopped watching or caring about new Stars Wars content a long time ago
I watch Ryan’s Pitch Meetings before I watch the show/movie to find out if the subject matter is a waste of my time.  The answer is “yes.” Thanks Ryan for saving me 1 1/2 to 6 hours of my time on a regular basis while also entertaining me.
Nice it
If Thrawn hadn't sent those two Tie Fighters Ahsoka, Ezra and Sabine would've gotten onto Thrawn's ship. They would have cut their way through Thrawn's Stormtroopers. Then they would have killed the Great Mothers and Thrawn himself (or taken him prisoner).
"And she meets Anakin Skywalker.  He's in the other movies! Thats right, sir. "
You failed to comment on how they throw out all of the Rebels and Clone Wars cannon on Ahsoka despising the Jedi and the fact there's no way in Hell she'd take on a Padawan as she uses both Dark Side and regular Force powers.
Im pretty sure i could have written a better fanfic than this when I was 14
Honestly you could end the video 30 seconds in. If crossing her arms and smirking makes Rosario Dawson Ahsoka I’m gonna audition for Kanan by closing my eyes and blowing myself up
..or another woke thing.,,space whales..oh my god.............................
It amazes me just how much these guys look a little like Ryan George.
Uhg, the mouse ears are on it all ...
For a swim? For a death!
You forgot the best part!!!!....that the lightsaber battles are like two 80 year Olds fighting for the last muffin at a retirement home.
Star wars has become so bad lmao
The tibia-shin joke was great! 😅
Please do the new Exorcist film sometime in the future. Thanks.
Did….did Producer Guy get a hair cut?
That truly was the best beard in the galaxy.
Do you remember thrawn? You know, the greatest tactician in the entire universe? Let's use the same voice actor from the animated series, but give him zero tactical abilities. Let's make sure that he says that he is very smart throughout the entire series, but constantly makes the dumbest possible decisions just so that the main characters can easily win the day, despite being as inept as any character has ever been written 🤦
Ugh…. Alright, I made a good call skipping this show. Bad writing all around.
All I can say is… thank goodness I haven’t had Disney since firing gina, and canning Johnny depp from allegations alone. Everything Disney touches nowadays just seems to be trash
😂😂😂😭😭😭
Do one for one piece
Love the comment about a bunch of stormtroopers not being very dangerous. And then about how the zombies are even less of a threat.
R.I.P. Star Wars...
Totally surprising that star wars: the girl boss show was terrible. Who could of predicted that!
I dont watch disney (rather than FX shows) anymore, id assume this was far more worth watching than the actuall show. Kenobi and Dr. Strange 2 kinda killed disney for me XD
wow wow wow .... wow
Well as bad as the rest of the show is…. Thrawns first appearance was fantastic, and his writing wasn’t half bad. Clearly the same smirky blue guy from the thrawn books!!!
Forgot to mention that the nostalgia cameo gets one of the protagonists off for getting two soldiers needlessly killed. :)
The big cameo is C3P0? The one character nobody every liked or cared about?
Thank you, I was considering awtching it but you saved me the time.
Different hair lengths on the sides.
What they forgot to mention was that ahsoka is actually stronger than ezra before you consider that sabine was also stuck there while thrawn managed to return
i like star wars and this is absolute rubbish
Do The Creator next. No need to be gentle either.
Just recently in a Disney studio far, far up its own rear end...
Wow nice video ❤
ahsoka genuinely sucks ass and if you like it i don't want to know you
I liked Ahsoka, but in these days people seem to not like anything
Def today I justed watched this instead of the actual show. 🤣
That was the most unconcerned “oh no..” I have ever heard.  😂😂😅
I know Disney is always failing and mostly bleeding money, but is there anyone watching any of this since the new fail starwars trilogy? i haven't seen anything that looked even approaching ok.... for anyone. they have been outdone by cartoon network cartoons, the originals, the extended universe, probably every fan made video, and hell even the prequels i think somehow have more redeeming qualities than anything they have made. its impressive that they cant even steal/re appropriate stories/characters to a point that would make any money. find a even half way passable writer please, it wouldn't matter if something is cannon plausible, has any continuity, nothing.... so long as you at least made a half way ok story and put a lightsaber in it. even the lose idea of achieving such a thing would already be 3x better than any of this. actors, cameos/remember berries, and all the CGI is all they have going for them.  much fail, such wow.
For a swim? For a death!
Ahsoko was written by a 5 year old using AI.
"She's just immediately that good at using the force?"  Woke Star Wars in a nutshell.
What about andor? You haven’t made a pitch about andor
make a game pitch meeting
Amazing breakdown as always!🔥
I'm very surprised he did not say 'no, not at all, barely an inconvenience' when Sabine gets stabbed...
Thanks for putting this together so I didn't have to watch the show. Much appreciated.
give a small pause like about 2 secs when changing between the (same) actors non-stop-talking, its very confusing
"so this thrawn guy can't be that much of a big deal, can he?" "Ohh he'll bring war and genocide to the galaxy!"  .....With what? With what plan? With what resources?  I'm beginning to notice that all of these star wars villains in the corporate era are written to be clueless losers that are just suggested to be intimidating and clever. They're "smart" people, written by stupid people, for whom "smart" people are indistinguishable from wizards.
Nobody knows this... But Ahsoka was played by a slow motion Angelina Sholie  And Morgan Elsbeth is not allowed to sit. Also she cannot help but to express feeling proud every 90... secs...Now that i mention it Ahsoka and the lady general also has this condition...
This was more entertaining than the entire season of the actual show.
Aquire a multi billion dollar brand, use a shit load of money to completely destroy it and piss off all the fans... Classic Disney!
Sabine Wren was one of the worst characters written in the recent Star Wars (her animated version wasn't that great but definitely much better than the live version). So glad that Ryan put a spot on that.
So Ahsoka is coming back with a white costume after meeting Balrog, I mean Baelen? Ahsoka the White? That's just lazy writing.
It’s crazy how thoroughly Disney has killed off any interest I had in Star Wars. Not even the prequels did that.
*"Did you watch The Ahsoka Show ?"* "I was going to and no, I didn't at all" -me after watching Pitch meeting
god i am so happy i didn’t waste time watching anything related to star wars since the last jedi :)
Ahsoka tv show has one of the absolute worst writing, insufferable characters, terrible acting and the light sabre fighting was pretty bad.  What a mess. No wonder Disney CEO wants to fire a third of the managers.
“Well, okay then!” I like how he questions things and immediately just goes along with it. Haha.
3:05 There it is!
Damn Disney,  just damn could you do much worse?
I only watched the first 2 episodes then,  figured Ryan would fill me in.  Glad I didn't waste my time.
Well your review of the show seemed more enjoyable than the show itself
Star Wars is dead
Love these
Space Whales? Was the 11th Doctor there?
Is this made for 5 year olds?
As long as writing quality in Hollywood goes down, this guy will always have content.
I think Andor deserves a pitch meeting at this point, make it happen Ryan!!!
Gawd that show was dumb and boring. Definitely looked cool with some neat moments but overall just stupid and written so poorly with little to no character development or back story. Who are these characters and what are their motivations. I guess you have to be a cartoon nerd to have a shmick what’s going on…
Whoa wait a minute...... Why isn't writer guy on strike?
Gotta love how Producer Guys is always asking the important questions that screen writer guy never really addresses
All things Star Wars-related seem to get less and less interesting to me by the day.
this series of videos is very hilarious and amusing. I'd like to see what they think of the Aquaman movie, I think it was goofy, campy and full of plot holes. the plot holes in superhero movies are frequently big enough to march a herd of space cows through, while playing some kind of, space ukulele, banjo hybrid that's oddly duck shaped.
This entire show cost maybe 500$ to produce. Ashoka cost 200,000 times more than that.
someone hasn't watched rebels...
Why do so many people act like Sabine's choices were go with Baylan or stop them from leaving. In reality, it was go with him or die. But she's a female character and haters gotta hate...
Perfect analysis of a dumb show.
I love how we just casually skipped over the Anakin segments with just one brief mention. 😂😂
Can you do a pitch meeting for one piece live action?
It's always a treat when you can say along with Ryan " It's gonna be/It'll be Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
4:10 You know, in a better written work this could actually be really good. An illustration of how the Empire's disregard for jedi and bigoted view of aliens leading to the guy Thrawn ordered to take care of Sabine and Ezra failing to take proper care and allowing them to survive. How the human-centrism of the Empire and superiority complex towards aliens, even ones as skilled and high-ranking as Thrawn, ultimately works against them and seals their own defeat.  Instead it just sounds dumb, man is told to not underestimate the protagonists, immediately turns around and underestimates them.
Ahsoka is by far my favorite SW character - I am so disappointed in this show 😒
I'm sure someone has mentioned it, but the character Sabine is an established rebel/Mandalorian character from the show SW: Rebels. Not once in that show is she shown to be even remotely Force sensitive. But the Ahsoka show just retconned her entire character because... only if you're a Jedi you're interesting I guess (I say this as someone who loves the Jedi). I mean, the Ahsoka show also broke some very important lore and established canon by making Sabine, for no good or logical reason, a Jedi, but go off I guess.   The Ahsoka show really said, "If you just *believe hard enough* you too can become Force sensitive!"
Honestly, this show looks so bad. And just from script guy and producer guy saying what happens.
Ahwoka.
The cameo we all wanted was Rex, we got 3-P0 instead. 😢
I'm so glad someone called out the assassination of Sabine's character.  Look, I know she cares about Ezra and has lost everyone she cares about (besides Hera and Zeb, who she doesn't seem to care much about), but this is the same mistake she made in her youth, giving the Empire a tool they needed for conquest.  One can say "oh she made this mistake before so she can make it again", but that seems the opposite.  People tend to learn and even over-react to their mistakes, so I feel like she'd be all about preventing this.  But, okay, they decided to go that way . . . surely everyone will hate her!  Oh, wait, Ahsoka's just like "it's fine" in the last 60 seconds of the show.  I guess it's cool.  The worst part is that Baylan could easily probably have just used the Force to get it from Sabine.  They could even just have had Sabine have a Force Vision or something that convinces her she must do this.  Hell, you could even play it off later as the Dathomiri witches having sent it.  Or, given how much effort Timothy Zahn went to making his Blue Meanie Fascist Gary-Stu secretly a good guy who only perpetuated a horrible civil war because GrEaTeR ThReAtS were out there, that could have been a vision seen by Sabine or Ahsoka.  Sort of like how sparing Gollum ultimately proved to save Middle-Earth.  For some butterfly effect reason, they are all doomed if Thrawn doesn't return.
Quit caring about Star Wars years ago. This kind of thing is the only way I'd know about this thing.
Literally nothing Disney has released show and movie wise has been even mildly good or decent. Andor was the only standout. It was light years ahead of anything Disney released
My name is Ryan George (alt account), and my social security number is 7. Just 7.
“NOT GOOD!”
In fairness, the whole "stepping off the ship in a stormtrooper outfit to fuck with everybody" is pretty in-character for Ezra.
I can't watch shows now without at least uttering one of his Ryanisms at least once. Wow wow wow, wow.
pls make one for one piece live action
Whales: providing acceptable navigation portals since Jonah.
How do these still get so many views, just as boring as the show was
Please do One Piece!🙏
It's both hilarious and depressing that one can make fun of Ass Soaker merely by describing what happens in it 😂😂😂
She's a super ahsoka
This shows how much I care... I'd rather just watch the spoilers on Pitch Meeting and be done with it.
Sure zombie stormtroopers don't amount to much against our heroes, they never do, but the common folk in the galaxy they're returning to are gonna lose their minds with fear when the symbol of their oppression for 20 years comes back, unkillable.
Thanks I’ve been waiting for this so I didn’t have to watch that pile of doo doo.
oh this is gonna be good
I’d like to see a writer guy on strike against producer guy video
Goal: MUST. STOP. BAD. GUY. Achievement: NONE.  Exact how do you make a WHOLE show about stoping one guy and then you DONT STOP THAT ONE GUY…
So accurate
Stopping a fart is literally tight!  😁
Setting the 'tone of safety' so early on by having a lightsaber be soooo survivable really did ruin things.  After that, every time Thrawn let them go instead of committing more forces was ... predictable.
PERFECT ANALYSIS!  Bullshit exposed!
All this fan fiction is really cute - but kind of pointless when the _only_ real Star Wars movies all happened back in the 70s and 80s.  Heck, I consider the Star Wars wookie Christmas special to be more canon than any crap that came after the original 3 . . .
Even this pitch meeting of this show is boring.
Ryan has ruined me for TV shows and movies... I'll be watching them now and it'll get to something and I'll think that literally made no sense for the character to do that
was a bug fan of starwars but i just stop after anakin become darth. remaining wnna bee tv series and movies just didnt work:(
The craziest thing about this show is that all the crazy plot devices (like the space whales traveling through hyperspace) didn't just come out of nowhere like a lot of shows, Dave Filoni has been building on them for years
theres nb way I'm watching that show and I kinda feel bad for Ryan having to do it
Who is this Tibia person?  You mean Shin.   😂😂😂😂😂
Oh no, I'll never be able to enjoy it again! Lol
Shin/Tibia joke... flawless
All this and he didn't really even scratch the surface of how ridiculous this show was.
Qui Gon Is Pissed You Survive Light Saber Stabs In the Chest Now
I think it would be funny to do a rebels pitch meeting, because the show introduces the characters and many people watched it after Ahsoka
The nerve of disney to rip off treasure planets iconic map ball after how they did that movie dirty
Yeah, after watching this it's official; Star Wars is a rabid dog that's become too far out of control and just needs to be put down.
"Stopping a fart is tight!" LOL... g'damit.  Truly impressive when you find new ways to make your catchphrases hilarious all over again.
The entire thing is pure gold  and long live producer guy and writers guy, who are of course two distinct people
This 6 minute video was more entertaining and vastly more intelligent than the entire series of A-joke-a. Or is it A-woke-a?
Wait your telling me they used the treasure map from treasure planet and then she does a Gandalf the Grey, dies and comes back as Gandalf the white? How original
Ryan George should be in-charge of Lucasfilm story group! You are simply tha best mate, better than all the rest!

hey, I mad this
Loved the Pitch Meeting!  Would love to see one for the Highlander Movies.
Alg poke
The ratings would have been better if Rosario Dawson had flashed her goodies, it’s not like she doesn’t know how.
I never saw the end of rebels but I do not remember Ezra looking like space Jesus 🤣
Why is she wearing a onesy pajamas with ears? My 4-year-old niece wears that to bed.
I hope this guy never stops making videos
I want to point out that the Corellia episode was so insignificant and forgettable that it didn't even make it into Ryan's Pitch Meeting, which is about as perfect of a commentary on it as could be made.
Spoilers ahead: Yeah I dont think that many people care about watching this show 😂
Morgan gets slashed across the spot Sabine got stabbed and dies but Sabine can just walk off being impaled....
Was looking forward to this. Could have definitely mentioned how most of their dispositions were so different from before. But man she really crosses her arms a lot for no reason doesn’t she??
Amazing
"She can't figure out this map because it's a ball." I snorted my drink.
And Filoni failed miserably, so Disney Star Wars fans, is this your messiah? Pathetic.
I didn't bother watching Ahsoka. It was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
I'm so happy Disney is making this; I just love watching their stock price go down, its my favorite series! The more garbage they produce the faster it goes down its intoxicating.
Day 2 of asking for a The Boys breakdown :)
Agents of shield season 7 needs a pitch meeting!
I am so happy I missed this woke shit show! Star Wars is dead to me.
"She's just immediately that good at using the force?" "Sir, she's a female character in a Disney property. That means she's immediately good at everything and you're on a list now."
To be fair "forgetting you're holding blasters" is absolutely the correct response to combat with most Jedi and Ahsoka in particular.
"Spoilers ahead"  Can you spoil something that is rotten?
Star Wars is UTTER TRASH now, has been for almost a decade.
*So not to be “that nerd” but those droids weren’t the reason for the giant explosion. We’ve seen them explode before and be much smaller. The reason the explosion was so big was because of the black powder covering the surface. That’s why the orb was encased in it. As a self destruct mechanism*
Barely an inconvenience
RG is the only REAL competition for Honest Trailers. I wonded if they have a 'friendly' rivalry between them. 🤔
I love how Ryan clearly hasn't seen Rebels. His confusion, such as with the space whales, would make perfect sense for anyone who hadn't seen Rebels (many claim Ahsoka is just Rebels Season 5). (disclaimer: i've seen neither Rebels nor Ahsoka but know enough to get the jist)  Star Wars has now fallen into the same trap MCU had (besides just generally being bad). There's far too much different content you have to watch just to understand the basic premise of the one show you are trying to watch.  5:29 Haven't you seen Force Awakens? XD
None of this is hyperbole or exaggeration; Ahsoka is really this stupid of a show.
The good guys and bad guys of Ahsoka remind me a lot of the good guys and bad guys in the National  Treasure films except the roles are reversed. In National Treasure Nick Cage has to solve intricate ancient puzzles with a singular decryption key artifact to get the next clue, meanwhile Sean Bean overhears a keyword by random and Googles it to gets the exact same information. In Ahsoka, Morgan Elsbeth has to the find and operate an ancient technology from a nearly forgotten civilization AND build a prototype starship capable of traveling between galaxies, meanwhile Ahsoka just hops into space whale. 🤦🏻‍♀
Make Lightsabers Great Again
Love it!
Ryan’s been watching some Critical Drinker, I see.
CHecked out after 2 episodes. Who would think that watching Star Wars has turned from some of the most fantastic movie experience many have ever had to... well feeling like homework.
His laugh when describing Ahsoka fighting on the outside her spaceship.
You would think getting hit with a lightsaber would mean almost certain death, but apparently it's barely an inconvenience!
Ooh, been waiting for this one. Have also been waiting for a Terminator 2: Judgment Day pitch meeting! For quite some time!
That beard is tight.
WHY DID THEY BOTHER TO DE-AGE HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN??? What was the point?? He looks fine
Hey Ryan, huge fan. Long time sub, first time poster. I have a couple of simple requests to put out there. Please please please, no more star wars related vids. It's easy picking for someone of your talents, my opinion. And second, hope about doing some seasonal movies? I would love to hear your take on old classics classics like it's a wonderful life or other from that era.
Haven’t watched one episode.
Sabin... Dyed hair in purple, orange and red. "Strong independent woman character" -Check!  Shin... Dyed hair in platina blond... "Evel, yet, strong and independent woman..." -Check!  OK, I havent seen this, but my 'connectional perception' leads me to this conclusion.
Jeez... Disney's Star wars sucks
"Tickled by a lightsaber" 😂😂😂
When she deflects & splits an entire spaceship heading at her full speed, he arm & lightsaber should’ve been thrown back, like a gun backfire. There’s isn’t one thing to connect w/ in these shows. And I absolutely hate how major injuries or fatal wounds mean literally nothing now, whether Marvel, DC , Star Wars, Fast& Furious, etc…there’s only one good constant in this whole mess(Ryan frickin George)
Think about how much money…i mean content… a Star Wars-MCU crossover would make
Come on the where's Andor pitch meeting video? Honestly going to tell me the least viewed Star Wars series of all time doesn't deserve one ?
Would totally love to see Sabine tickled tbf.
This show was awful the only thing good about it was ray stevenson's character
Poor zombie stormtroopers...they are so weak, they don't even get the full "super easy barely an inconvenience" catchphrase, just 'yeah barely'.
This Producer Guy and Writer Guy are really starting to irritate me.  They have ruined countless shows for me by applying simple logic to the plots.
The fact that someone can survive a lightsaber stabbing is already ridiculous enough, but Disney is going out of its way to make it happen in every single new Star Wars thing and that just leaves me speechless.
The series was such a let down. Thrawn was a joke, the dead Stormtroopers were pointless unlike the book "Death Troopers". The scene with Ezra and Sabine reunion was not impactful at all. Ezra doesn't get outraged that Sabine gave Thrawn a way to return with his military forces after his sacrifice to exlie him from the war. Sigh. Nothing can save Star Wars now.
Producer guy and Screenwriter guy need an extra who shows up occasionally. "Secretary girl"!!! Think about it ❤😂😊
Producer guy is correct - there IS something missing from this review. Hera has been trying her damnest to be court martialed and distrusted and NO ONE gives a shit.
“So, you have a new idea for me?”  “Dear heavens, no! Haven’t needed one of those for years.”
So, that was accurate.
You could totally hear Ryan laughing when he describes how Ahsoka fights ships in space.
Love Pitch Meetings! Saved me a ton of money paying for shit movies.
You did not do a pitch meeting for andor i would like to see it
If light sabers aren't lethal weapons any more.........what are they for?
"Stoppin a fart is TIGHT!" Correct, to stop a fart you must CLENCH.
It's exhausting how bad Star Wars has gotten. Mind numbingly dull.
Faloni is the Hollywood equivalent of a 6 year old smashing action figures together.
Pitch Meeting for: X-Files
i stopped watching the show very early on so I didnt know about the space lightsaber fight and only am now seeing it in the clips here for the first time. I audibly gasped and put my hand over my mouth in shock and disgust when I saw it.
YES! 05:30
Every episode I try to guess what the big headline from Screenrant is gonna say and I’m always surprised
lmao anyone who still pays for Disney is a chump
I love how this guy have no new ideas and keep doing the same joke over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah you get it, i found him about a month ago and he is already stale as fuck
So "But-" is the new catchphrase?
I love the transition in the video ❤
‘She learns it’s better to live than to die.’   ‘Did she not know that?’ 😂
Not gonna lie, I actually thought she was a marvel superhero.  I'm so detached from marvel and star wars since Disney graped their precious little b-holes.
Disney, give me back my STAR WARS you bastards!!!
Thank you for calling out the arm-crossing.  It really bothered me, too much really, that Ahsoka is standing around all smug like for almost the ENTIRE series!
I did some VFX on this. At least it looked cool right? and the beard is the best part
This is how i catchup to starwars. Honestly this one was so boring even in Pitch meeting that i fell asleep
I never got a notification for this. Damn YouTube
These two fellas typically get it right, but they (these two fellas) freakin nailed it on this one.
Has he watched star wars rebels?
5:30 she's just immediately that good at using the force   Yes Because she is a Woman
I just noticed that producer guy and writer guy have different haircuts 🤯
It's hilarious how your just reading the plot of these  shows basically... they are all so badly written its comedy gold 😂 love it haha
I don't follow Star Wars.  However, it is so pervasive that I know who Ahsoka is and I can spell Thrawn!  What useful information am I missing that such trivialities are displacing?
This guy is a kook.   Lame nerd.
When a Ryan and Star Wars cross their way it doesn't end good for the franchise. 😅
The shin/tibia thing was real good
They really need Ryan in the writer's room of tv and movies these days.
Someone missed a massive chance when asking why Sabine suddenly becomes a competent force user without years of training: because the force is female, you see?
Critical Drinker has really opened my eyes whencit comes to this industry. Wonderful channel
1:20 Producer Guy: "So who is this Tibia person that attached her?" Writer Guy: "Shin" Producer Guy: "What did I say?"
sabene is the one who distracted everyone so ezra could go on a suicide mission in rebals so why would she betray everyone to find him. IT MAKES NO SENSE!
I would have preferred a show that just showed Huyang being sassy to Jedi across countless generations.
Nobody is taking about the fact that Ryan shot one part of the video, then had a har cut and shot the second part of the video.
Love your content Ryan. Great pitch meetings.
I've actually used "that will be super easy, barely an inconvenience" in a high level project meeting for a mid sized European pharmaceutical company, nobody batted an eyelid.
Did you ever do an Andor one? Or do you only parody bad pitches? :)
Thanks for watching this crap so we don't have too.
At 0:24 and 0:30 I completely agree! Ahsoka is my absolute favorite Star Wars character and I love Rosario Dawson, but I do NOT like how Ahsoka is being portrayed in live action. She has no personality whatsoever, she is just stoic and smirks. The character of Ahsoka has way more personality than what has been shown in live action.
"She's just immediately THAT good at using the force?"  "Yes."   That, right there, is the shortest summary of Episodes 7, 8, & 9 that I've ever seen.
"Stopping a fart is tight" -- I bet Ryan wrote that 10 years ago and has been waiting to use it ever since
Very nice and beautiful
they have different haircuts!
My Thrawn is a ruggedly handsome blue man, not Elon Musk with a gizzard.
Producer guy feels like I do. Tried so hard to get interested and still be a fan then Disney Disney's and... 😐😮‍💨
Honestly surprised Filoni dropped the ball so hard with this one. Mando seasons 1 and 2 were great. The Clone Wars cartoon was overall pretty solid. Even Rebels went from something overly childish (which, to be fair, it was made for the child audience) to something I eventually appreciated. What the fuck happened with this show?
2:14 that's a bar
“ Content for the sake of content” pretty much sums up Disney+ these days.
This is the only way I watch movies any more. Anything else is a waste of time and money.
Usually enjoy pitch meetings but this was really lazy. Anyone can poke fun at scenes and circumstances out of context and mischaracterization. The biggest offense saying that Ahsoka learned to live and not die was particularly reductive. She already suffered reconciling her violent past with finding peace with the living force. Then she had Baylan using that fear against her saying her master’s legacy meaning Anakin was one of destruction. In context she hasn’t seen Anakin since he was Vader. By forgiving herself, Anakin and the Jedi and letting go of her strife, pain and fear she becomes an agent of the living force.
HOLD UP. NOT ONE SHOUT OUT TO THE CINEMATOGRAPHER ON HERA'S PEACH? LIKE DUDE...
Another abortion from Disney!
I think Ryan got a haircut between recording his writer and producer scenes.
God I hate what Disney did to Star Wars
From everything they've done up to this point, deflecting a shot from a star ship should be straight up impossible, even if you're the chosen one you can't do that. That was probably the dumbest part of it all for me I hated it.
All I could think about was how she traded an entire galaxy of people for one person, who if he had know would have told her not to.
disney has destroyed marvel AND star wars now.
wait, the producer guy has slightly different hair than the writer guy!
“Spoilers” like anyone with half a brain couldn’t predict this series plot points perfectly without having seen it?
"Content for the sake of content" = Disney
The idea that Producer Guy would have a problem with just making content is a bit weird
2:08 the same reason jets and helicopters have to fly into giant monsters. They have a special gravitational pull that only works to show how dangerous they are
Mandalorian didn't get an episode dedicated to him
Thank god i did not watch this show
Cool fan art
Amazing
Star Wars is long dead and buried. Ass-ohka is just a result of a few Disney grave robbers f*cking around the gravesite for some loose change.
This
This show was so dissatisfying😢😂
“Disney+ is due for a good plop”
Pinch meeting, cinema sins tried and boring now please try and be original.
Best beard in the Galaxy😂
He actually laughs when describing her fighting space ships with her lightsabers.  The absolute state of Star Wars writing lol
"Due for a Big Ploppin' " perfectly describes the latest stuff on Disney+
Since when was Sabine a jedi?
Can Disney please, Please, PLEASE think of a different plot idea than looking for a dang map.  The creative bankruptcy permeating this company is reaching new levels.
War? Yes, genocide? No
Disney is an absolute joke
Can someone explain the very first joke. About doing Ahsoka and obeying the law
the Zombie stormtroopers were worse but it was pretty cool to see that be a thing. Ahsoka definitely needed more personality. I liked her a lot more in clone wars as Snips. Great pitch meeting as always. Sabine not telling ANYTHING to her friend was so frustrating to me
Don't forget Hera abusing her authority and getting two people killed, and then avoiding any consequences.
Best star wars show yet by far
The guy with the greatest beard in the galaxy is the best character in this thing. Sadly, he passed away.
Tibia
Why does thrawn look like elon musk in blue face?  I've watched more ryan george sw mcu content than the actual shit.
Dear God, stay away from dis+! Your thinking health depends on it!
Damn: nailed it
Day 1 of asking for Jojo Rabbit
Some day Disney, WB and all the major studios are going to pool resources and offer Ryan billions to stop making Pitch Meetings and the world will be lesser for it. 😂
"Stopping a fart is tight" is now my favorite Producer-Guy quote
Surviving lightsaber stab is "super easy barely an inconvenience"
getting a haircut between takes is tight
Like the idea of very much 😅
This is a pretty good assessment of what this show must’ve looked like to people who’ve never seen Clone Wars or Rebels 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I’m pretty sure the only reason this show decided that they needed to be stranded in another galaxy (as opposed to an “impossible to reach” corner of the main one) was so that one character could say the line “a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.”
I was not too interested in this series, now I'm not interested at all. 🙈
I wish the actual producers would watch this...movies now SUCK!
The protagonists super easy, barely an inconvenienced there way through all the obstacles they faced, which is why it was so boring!!!
Your name and your social security number
Ryan should bring a rock to anything star wars related and say, "Ok , we are going to squeeze some more juice out of the non - fruit thing." Or Ryan should just dress like a shark with some skies in his hand and say "Disney, please stop making me so much money"
At this point i just want DIS to go bankrupt
you forgot the part where Thrawn's star destroyer was loaded with the MacGuffin widgets hours before Ahsoka and Friends were anywhere close, but inexplicably chose to wait around and send stormtrooper banta fodder roadblocks rather than just leaving.
good
Ryan pls make Pitch Meeting for Across Spiderverse
"Who is this Tibia person" nice
Why has she got white light sabers, is she a Jedi? WTF is going on? And why is Anakin from Uncanny valley there?
Only Ryan can convey the ridiculousness and lack of talent that exists in today's Hollywood through these skits.
Pretty disappointed in Honest Trailers and this channel completely ignoring sassy Huyang in a combined 15 minutes of talking.  Was one of the best parts.
“Tickled by a lightsaber” hahahahaha
Tibia 🤣🤣🤣
Wasn’t Thrawn trapped in the ‘Unknown Region’ in our Galaxy?!? Suddenly now he’s in another Galaxy entirely…. Umm okay, why doesn’t he just taken over THAT Galaxy?!? This story was so dumb…. 😮‍💨
That tibia/shin joke better get the credit it deserves.😆
Tibia person.   *snork*
Best beard in the galaxy.      😂😂😂
Conan O'Brien as Thrawn was a big surprise.
Who is this tibia person that attacked her? "Shin" what did I say? Hahahahaha
To be fair, the fact that the whales will take you to where Thrawn is was sort of established in a previous show. The whole reason Thrawn is where he is is because those same whales took him there.
Did this episode NOT have a "super easy barely an inconvenience???????"
I can’t believe that’s a real series they actualy made, crazy
Tibia........ Im ded
I feel bad for Jedi Master  Qui-Gon Jinn... stabbed identically, instant death. She gets stabbed, boom, up and running immediately. Even Darth Maul gets cut in half, then survives. We've learned that huge falls don't kill bad guys either, they "somehow return."
Didn't even get to the minefield where they replaced rhe explosives with fireworks and the shrapnel with confetti
We can see that during the tibia/shin part, Ryan had a hard time trying not to laugh his ass off XD
I'm a bit worried by the tendency of these satire formats to unilaterally pan subtle/reduced acting ('Honest' Trailers is way worse about it), because it might lead to that falling out of fashion. I really liked Rosario Dawson's performance, from her very first appearance on the Mandalorian. There's sensible criticism (like the glaring plot holes, that seem to have become so common in modern movies/shows), and there's simple bashing. Both can be fun, but they're not the same.
I especially like the part when Ahsoka crosses her arms in the middle of the battle for the castle ..that was tight.
The Force is definitely female! Men in the Star Wars universe have to train for years to become a Jedi and to be able to use The Force, while women just pick it up in a few seconds and can master it almost immediately. You know, a bit like Rey!
Might just be me, but i feel like i've seen this one already? anyone else have a deja vú?
Did anyone who came here even watched the show or like me listened to the entire story from Ryan
*Ezra:* Hey so how did you find me anyways must've been very much an inconvenience for you all *Sabine:* gonna need you to hop all the way off my back about it *Ezra:* oh okay lemme just get offa that thing.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who found Dawson's portrayal plodding. That was an epic miscasting (or else she was given incredibly bad direction.). The entire show played as though it were being played back at half speed. If they had just tightened up the speaking parts, they could have finished the whole series in 4 episodes.
WHERE ALL MY JUMPING SPIDER LOVERS AT?? <3
No, Rosario, I said confident, not smug. No...that's still smug. No...that's still smug, but with your arms folded. Oh, to Hell with it. It's too late to get someone else, and it took 5 hours to glue the tentacles to her head.
God Ass-soaker is shit.
No joke about Balin being a crossover from LOTR?  Now I’ll need to watch the show to make comparisons to LOTR characters.  Thrawn might be like Smaug but, Thrawn is Einhorn. Einhorn is Thrawn.
Yeah...unfortunately sounds about right 🙄 Thanks for the chuckle(s) !
Luke: *Spends a whole day to lift a rock* A Bean: *Launches a person a few dozen feet into the air* Mmhm, checks out
I like that Producer Guy just put a blazer on over his pajamas.  That's tight!
Modern American 'entertainment' really is dogshit. I am so grateful that Asia exists.
At this point do we really need to watch movies? Pitch meeting can summarise is it for us.
Watching the show is like getting the girl home and finding out she has a dick. You still watch the show but it doesn't feel very good
Can we take a moment to appreciate how Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy actually have different haircuts in this one? lol.
“She’s just immediately that good at using  he force?” “Well she’s a woman isn’t she?“
Who else watched this video instead of watching the entire series? Or is it just me?
I used to love star wars. Now not so much..
For Disney shows/movies, producer guy should dress up like Mickey Mouse
Just a reminder: Star Wars is a 40+ year old franchise.  Stop. Watching. Star Wars.
„Content for the sake of content“  Isn‘t that most of Disneys content?
Not counting Andor the anomaly, disney wars shows seem to be trying to one up each other at being terrible  One piece of consistency in disney wars, I can absolutely believe purple hair was a top general in TLJ and the green lady was her mentor The writers of this show must have the average intelligence of a wet bent spoon to think just because someone is a general she has access to freaking anything and everything
Truly an inspiring performance by Rosario the way she folded her arms and smirked all cocky like.  Every.  Damn.  Scene.  Just inspiring.  I love it because if I didn't I'd be a sexist.  I LOVE IT
Thanks man. Saves me the trouble
THANK YOU for making the arms-crossed smirk the first thing you noted. Every time she did that, I wanted to rip the television down from the wall.   Don’t get me wrong. Show was decent, but the proud know-it-all posture drove me nuts. It’s not like she’s Obi Wan Kenobi.
I mean... The hyper space whales actually existed since Rebels, and they were what actually brought Erza and Thraw to that planet in another galaxy in the first place.  So, considering it was indeed a common route for them, the chances actually weren't that slim.  But yeah... the show still does have a lot of silly ideas...
Sabine surviving the lightsaber stab is what really threw me in this show. So, Han Solo dies from it but she doesn't?
We are burying the lead here. Producer guy had a haircut. Production and timing on this episode 👨‍🍳💋
Unlike the Stormtroopers, Ryan never misses.
"a soak ah" 🤣
You can't even parody how stupid Dave Filoni's writing is.
Can't wait for the crossover with EFAP one day
on star wars stuff i always give thumbs down at first but then i give a thumbs up again for the pitch meeting
Wait, thier different guys?!
What a horrible fuckin show. Star Wars is ruined. I’m just waiting for a complete Star Wars remake at this point, but with a good studio and directors
I would’ve rather just had another season of Rebels. Anyone else?
❤❤❤❤
Please tell me the writers for Star Trek Discovery and Ashoka are the same....
another woman power bullshit..
I made me so f*** furious that disney didn't allow Sabine and Ezra to have an emotional Reunion, because a woman can't hug a man (her friend/like brother) anymore in 2023. Wich is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!😡😠😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🥱😡🥱😡🥱😡🥱🥱😡🥱😡😡🥱😫😫😩😩😩
I’m glad I didn’t waste a minute on this series. Sabine has super force powers?  And this part is for Disney… Stop FREAKING stabbing people with lightsabers and making it just a scratch.  For F’s sake.
Disney star wars is garbage
Thanks to Ryan for once again saving me the hours of wasted investment having to watch this show.
Ryan is an absolute hero.  He has already saved me from 100+ hours of horrible content, and I figure that has to be multiplied by several million worldwide
When are we going to get a pitch meeting for Andor? It was a fantastic show, I wanna see how he can tear it apart
Ok guys heres the pitch... lets make complete dog Sh it and then when people don't like it will call them RACIST and misogynist, plus when we go bankrupt, we'll get pappa Biden to bail us out
I like the extent of dedication to the character that Ryan will go to and cut his hair for producer guy
Another mess to the growing pile of bull. Great summary once again. These videos save us for watching the utter shit that is Disney Star Wars.
You didn't show Ahsoka landing and rolling after jumping out of that space thingy. It had CGI on par with BIRDEMIC. Garbage Disney budget is tight!
I called it from the first time Sabine and the force were mentioned in the same sentence; she was going to pull a massive force ability out her butt when the plot needed it. My living room still smells so bad from all the nonsense this show pulled out its own butt.
Ahsoka is such a stupid show. Every problem gets solved immediately, there are no consequences ever and the main characters only emotion is acting smug about everything.
I really like how for shows or movies I know I am never gonna see, I can still enjoy the pitch meetings
This and Nerdrotic are about the closest I'll ever get to watching Disney's Asshoaker.  So spoil away!
Episode 1: Gui-gon uses a saber to melt steel doors. Ahsoka: Lightsabers give you a small wound in your torso.
and "fans" will swear that the new stuff is good
I like how the guys had different haircuts this time. Lol. Great job Ryan
Can't wait for the retrospective on this
5:29 EXACTLY what I was thinking while watching
I'm glad I didn't watch the show. Lol
Thanks Ryan! I wasn't going to watch the show but now I am going to not watch it even harder.
Disney Star Wars completely f**ked up with this series.  Nothing makes sense, the innocent lives of the beings of the entire galaxy don't matter, and the Leftist ideological BS is utterly off the charts.
As a Japanese “Ah sou ka” as a character name really leaves me wondering 🙃
Ahsoka was a poor show. Stiff fight scenes and just horrible to watch
bro got a little fat, lower your calorie intake, my man.
"Wait, so a lightsaber is a tickle for Sabine but it's blowing up starships and killing bad guys?"  "Yeah, see, lightsabers are only lethal when we need them to be. That's just how it is now, we decided."  "Very convenient!"
When you think about it, Sabin does the same thing Anakin did that turned him to the Darkside and F*cked up the galaxy, but she gets away it.
Oh no!
Why did they not get Jada Pinkett "Smith" to play Assoka
So glad I didn't waste my time on this show! Also, at 2:32, after "dying" she learns to dress in light clothes; hey, wait a minute - didn't Gandalf already learn that lesson in Lord of the Rings?
I would rather watch a show about Shin and Baylan than Ashoka
If there's 1 thing that I don't want from old star wars it c fucking 3po. The most annoying droid in the universe.
Ahsoka AhSuckaed real BAD
This show was written by someone with absolutely no writing talent. Take for example the dream sequence. They borrowed it from far superior scripts forgetting that the differences that there's some type of measurable change in the character. She came back essentially the same and learning a stupid lesson that a 4-year-old knows. Yes and throw in the white duds ala Lord of the rings. Garbage
wait what? writer guy and producer guy have different hair this time! multiple ryans confirmed.
We love you George Ryan! ❤
Sounds about right
Ashoka is pure garbage
The entire thing is pure gold.
Wow wow wow wow wow........ wow! That sounded like... one of the shows of the year, for sure; was definitely a TV Show 😐
"We can dive into that or MONEY!" "I like money!"
Hopefully writer guy doesn't strike what would producer guy do with out him?
CP-Cameo my favorite character in all Star War
Question:   When you get into these flows of describing super convenient chains of coincidences in a plot, I'm like ''Woah so on point and so detailed'' it almost feels like you had the actual script and worked from it.   So, I was wondering, what do you start with as a first draft/base material? Do you just write down as much as you can while you watch a movie or series then rewatch to add details?
On this day Pitch Meeting history was made!  Producer Guy and Screenwriter Guy both have different haircuts! Wow!
Love Writer guy. He should find a new Producer guy though. This one asks questions, and that's not good. 🤣🤣
Some of your pitch meetings have really low hanging fruit!
How has no one picked up that they just stole the whale part from finding nemo? Jump into a whales mouth and it’ll arrive where the main character needs to be!
Stopping a fart is tight!!! Brilliant
I love these pitch meetings, but i think Ryan went easy on them this time, cuz this show is/was terrible. I guess Disney now figures if they just stick a lightsaber and literally any old character from any old Star Wars we'll all eat it up.
To sum up this series: Ezra and Thrawn swap their spots in the time-out box with Sabine and Ahsoka.
1:39 recovered from being tickled by a lightsaber 😂
Better than the show. I rather watch all your stuff on repeat than to watch one Disney crap again 😉
Oh Wow wOw woW....                 WOW!!!
Its  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.  Do what you will with this information!
2:20 "She's going to spend a whole episode in the world between worlds ..."  An entire episode that is basically a dream or hallucination? Oh, good. Those are never a complete waste of time.
Bruce Wayne 084-30-1939  I dare you!
Zombie troopers... Perfect to fight an enemy that can quickly laser cut all of your limbs and reduce you to an undead useless potato...
Now make a pitch meeting on the new exorcist movie please
Ryan could have included the *long* pretentious pauses after every sentence that were meant to increase the "watched minutes" on Netflix.
They can't be the same person. They have different hair. Duh
Disney redefines the "nothingburger"...
This is making me seriously consider cancelling D+
2:02 this is whats wrong with Disney and Star Wars. Whoever came up with that scene was thinking of WW2 airplane fights.. the crafts are even designed like WW2 fighters.. yet if you turn on your brain for a second you would realize they are in a vacuum... can just stop and fire on the ship from afar.. The show is as dumb as the movies in which a guy flies into a ship, without any exit... and makes it explode without himself dying..
Is it me or does Producer guy have a different haircut?
Here at 527,171 views.
"Tickled by a LIGHTSABER" Never a more accurate phrase.
U gettin fat bro!.... In a good way😂
Superb Shit Ashoka Is
Love your content Mr. George
I love the fact that this OtHeR gALaXy has literally one planet, that has one tower and a meadow, where Ezra and Thrawn lives.   Convenient! Cos if the galaxy was well, galaxy-sized (like one might wrongfully assume), it would’ve been giga hard (and even interesting) to search for the two particular individuals.
Could have done with a little more balance. I noticed recently a lot of negative points and not many good ones. Ahsoka had some really cool moments
This is the very first time that you have reviewed something that looks so incredibly nonsensical that I could barely finish the Pitch Meeting, and that's saying something.
Love how ZERO effort was put in by Rosario Dawson in the lightsabre fight scenes.
This must have been mentioned many times before but Pitch Meeting was originally intended to make fun of corporate executives meddling with the creative process. Now it's corporate executives being mind-boggled by how dumb the scripts are. The quality of writing has really, really gone down for big budget properties.
The storm troopers were slightly more threatening than warm butter
2:50 Nah, don't worry about that, he is just blue Elon Musk after he hit his head really hard on some blast door, the only ones he will be genociding with his sheer stupidity are his own troops ... I mean they are zombies so who cares anyway XD
LOL Star Wars 😂 😂
I hate how current shows and films have done away with lessons and messages now. There's no need to ever make a sacrifice anymore, things just work out and there are no consequences for bad, selfish decisions
Yeah so what was the point of the stormtroopers becoming zombies just to die again just as easily?😂
Yes Yes Yes !!
Watching Pitch Meeting so you don't have to watch a garbage show is TIGHT!
I noticed all the characters are women. But the villain is a white woman. Disney being Disney.
weird, how many "coincidences", which absolutely help the plot to get forward happen in this series.
"They sure do sir".... lol.
Star wars 🤢🤮
Ryan's the best. Please do Dexter.
4:39 this is basically Star Wars in a nutshell
The Force went from being a mysterious mystical energy field that could slowly be tapped into.....to a video game-style set of perks that immediately give you nifty abilities without effort or training.
Watching the latest Ryan George video is barely inconvenient, not a challenge!😊
'due for a big ploppin'  this may be the best description of Disney content I've ever come across on the internet
Ahsoka the show was a let down
always seems to make my day a lil brighter
I loved Ahsoka 😂😂😂😅
Turns out filling a show entirely with characters who are always calm and serene and have no real goals or inner conflict we get to see (Ahsoka, bearded Fallen Jedi Guy, Ezra, Morgan) or are calm and collected with a plan we never get to see (Thran) or are introverted and neurotic and never do anything useful except do what they were told not to do (Sabine, Shin), leads to a pretty boring series. Also, replacing the mysterious Force with an even more mysterious and less defined "magic" that can do whatever the plot needs it to do. Somehow, the live aciton series managed to take all the ingredients that worked in the animated _Rebels_ series but made them boring.   Seriously, the only interesting character was the droid who was hundreds of years old and had trained Jedi children.  And who knew how to build lightsabers out of parts he had just lying about on Ahsoka's ship so that Sabine could make herself a new lightsaber on the fly, in a sideplot in a 2 minute scene. You know, an apprentice Jedi creating their first own lightsaber... the thing that's treated as super-important in the Clone Wars series and in Star Trek video games?
Kinda reinforces my utter lack of interest in watching that show.
If there's anything I might need to know the lore to, but don't want to spend ages actually watching it, Pitch Meeting is my first port of call <3
Ahsoka DeezNuts
Yep. Sums that series up perfectly. ❤
I love that Pitch Meeting saves me hours upon hours of watching stuff I have a vague interest in and proves that I was right to not bother watching it.
by far the 2nd worst Star Wars series behind Obi Wan.
Damn. I enjoyed that show and I’m dead serious in saying I feel very stupid for enjoying it.
after two episodes i quit
Nostalgia cameos are tight
"...and he has the best beard in the Galaxy!" "Wut?" 😂
Your name & social security number... Ok. I left it...Umm now what? 😂
It's not even incompetence at this point, it's blatant agenda pushing.
I'm surprised he didn't mention how the zombie troopers just stopped to watch the fight between Ahsoka and Morgan.  They could have just shot her from all directions or something... LOL
I’m so glad I skipped the series and waited for the Pitch Meeting.
Hands down. Disneys whole strategy is solely done to provide enough content for years of pitch meetings to come. I appreciate that
They certainly plopped all right.
Oh, how could you forget the idea of a general having a bring-the-kid-to-the-office day!
Bad Guys love having secret maps that lead to them ❤
You could easily stretch the content of this video as long as an "A sucker" episode
Pitch Meeting always makes me realise how my love for the characters and the universe makes me blinkered to all the faults. Although even I went "Oh, C'MON!!" at Sabine surviving the lightsaber impalement.
Luke trained under jedi masters and still could barely use the force before more urgent things came up. What's this beginner's long distance sniping push?
Actually pitch meeting guy missed thrawns entire character. He has nightsister who could have located    ezra position but doesnt. He had sabine on hand whom he could have captured or killed preventing her reunion with ezra. He lost many explosive without even hurting ahsoka not even killing a single whale. He could have conducted aerial attack to kill three of them but left them. He lost his most loyal follower. He let ezra escape to new republic. He couldn't kill one jedi, one trainee and one without having proper training and experience for years. Can we think this character can defeat new republic. This character was the most intelligent chacter in legends now turned to a mediocre palpatine wannabe who despite his failure always like to say " all according to plan."
Watching this was tight 😂
Writer guy can’t keep a straight face describing this piece of pure stupidity.
These jokes basically write themselves. Ryan just needs to sum up the plot with it rediculous contradictions and holes.
Nailed it. Thanks. Filoni, watch this. And pay some attention if it's not too inconvenient.
This crap was the worst Star Wars thing I have ever seen, and I saw the Holiday Special...
It's unbelievable how terrible the Ahsoka show is :'D Either Dave Filoni let his kid write this show and if he doesn't have a kid it was probably the dog or the cat, or he is just terrible at what he does.  He probably didn't contribute much to the animated shows, by the looks of it.
That's show was utterly horse shit
Wait!! I just realize something!! Writer and producer is the same guy 🤯🤯🤯
Good suit! Hello from Ukraine💙💛!
I wondered more than once if the screenplay for Ahsoka was put together during the writers strike.  I.e. they didn't have one and just made it up as they went along.
I feel like these shows exist just to people to make videos about analysing every character cameo and nothing else
“Not good!” Lollll
"...tickled by a lightsaber..." Yep, that's Star Wars from now on. 😑
Always two there is, a Writer and a Producer
Crosses arms and smirks
Let's go haircut!
Watching the pitch meeting instead of watching the dumb fucking show is tight!!!
This franchise has fallen so far, I can barely stand to even watch the Pitch Meetings anymore. Disney sucks.
The idea of producer guy don't know shit about the thing he's being pitched on is literally in his character now
I liked this show, I really did, but SW fans talking about it like it's the best thing ever were reaaally blinded by fanservice cameos and nostalgia, weren't they?
This is why it's a bad idea turning a cartoon into a live action show. It's still a cartoon but it looks even more ridiculous now. Fooloni should stick to making cartoons and stop deluding himself in thinking he's the successor of George Lucas.
And on the other side you have TCW junkies screaming ‘’MASTERPIECE!’’ ‘’BRILLIANT!’’ ‘’MADE ME CRY 🥲’’
"Ahsoka manages to kill a fart" LOL DED!
when she came back she was Ahsoka the white lol...hmmmmm now where did they get that idea from......
Imgine running the company that owns Star Wars and then running it straight into the ground.  Bob Igar is the pilot and hes just pushing on the yoke to nose dive straight into the ground.  I love it.
Does anyone else find Sabine hot, or is just me?
This show looks terrible. Glad I cancelled my Disney+ years ago.
I just love how positively you pitch all of Ahsoka's plot flaws where much of the internet is raging 😍
Seriously, all writers should hire a Ryan George just to point out all the dumb sh*t he picks them up on in these pitch meetings. It would save so much pain!
Fantastic.  Much, much, much more entertaining than the show itself.
my buddy keeps insisting these shows are good and I have no idea why
Boy did you ever nail this turd of a show to a wall with steel spikes of scorn. Well Done boys, you make a great team for Canadian midget twins.
No mention of young Anakin or the live action clone war snippets? Best part of the show!
I watched the whole Ashoka thing and loved it but now after watching pitch meeting I agree it is stupid 😂🤣
That last episode made the whole season seem pointless. Why go through all that but then say they are where they're supposed to be?
What's worse than the Ahsoka series? All the people saying it's good.
I dont watch any of this Disney+ Star Wars shite. Was a Star Wars fan all my life before Disney took over. Its just unwatchable.
Honestly, the Ahsoka show was pretty underwhelming. There were lots of little issues, and aside from my love of Thrawn and David Tenant, there wasn't much to really keep me interested
I love this. :)
this really adds up that Disney puts more thoughts on fanservice and milking remaining fans than actually making sensible plot and less annoying, badly written characters that just have thick plot armour and nothing else to add to them.
Can't believe so many ppl in the comments actually watched this movie, show, w.e it is..🤦‍♂️🤣
I (didn't watch) heard so many dumb things about this show but oh my God, the super brief clip of ahsoka fighting in space looked so stupid!
Ok, but when are you going to do an Andor pitch meeting?
Gettin inside a whale is TIGHT!
This story is so stupid you would believe a 5 years old has written it.
I noticed how Ryan couldn't keep his real laughter from coming out when he was explaining the Ahsoka fighting ships in space outside her ship that's how silly it was😂
Writers: *say some BS* Producers: "Well, OK then!"  Basically modern Hollywood in a Nutshell. 😂
This video, and I mean this quite genuinely, is the Star Wars takedown in the streaming era equivalent of Plinkett’s seminal reviews of the prequels. Ryan George absolutely eviscerated every terrible trope of these shows with all the emotion they deserve: apathy. In six short minutes he exposed the whole fucking thing.
Ryan seemed a little put out this time. Usually Producer Guy is charmingly keen, but sometimes it’s hard to get excited by the latest content. Particularly when some of it was so stupid. I mean stormtroopers have always been ridiculously easy to kill, but this show took it to a whole new level. Literally no tension at all
Missed opportunity, when Anakin Skywalker was mentioned he could have been like "He was in the other movies!" Or something 😂 great job
The "zombie stormtroopers being more terrible than regular terrible stormtrooper" line had me dying.
Despite all this, I really enjoyed the show. 😊
umm, producer guy has a different hairdo to screenwriter guy!!! The universe is crumbling!!!
Fighting a bunch of stormtroopers - isn't that - repetetive?
It sounds ... like a terrible series that destroys everything. They cook the same soup over and over again, and frankly, it just tastes like water. They have a thousand years they could use. But no, the same ... 30 years over and over for eternity. That is equivalent to us only making films about the Second World War, and only from one angle. At some point people get tired of it and start asking the question, are they as evil as people claim?  Technically, the Empire were the good guys. The Jedi were evil tyrants who kidnapped children and brainwashed people. Certainly up to fighting a war against a better government. Just ... because.
“Content for contents sake” is an accurate description of Ashoka
"Ahsoka's gonna manage to kill a fart."  "Oooooh, Stopping a fart is TIGHT." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
'...and the best beard in the galaxy.'  'What?' ahahah true. No wonder Stephenson played Blackbeard in Black Sails
Way to weigh in after the fact. Up next, water is wet.
Hang on a second; who made this map that leads to Not-Thrawn? How did they learn where Thraud is of he's in a completely different galaxy? Why did they even make the map in the first place? If the map maker wanted General Dad-Bod to be found, then why haven't they kept this information on a need-to-know basis among the people trying to reach some blue dude with the posture of a seahorse?  Why is this the *third* DisnESG Star Wars fan fiction where the inciting plot device is a map that leads to a fan-bait character?  How does Darth Kennedy still have a job? Does she have video footage of Nob Iger at an Eye Wide Shut party on Little St. James Island?
Anakin: “Living is better than dying Ahsoka just ask all the Padawans I killed.”
Dang, no The Clone Wars Anakin
I tried so hard to watch this show, but became insanely bored and barely made it through the first episode. And, knowing that Ryan, Producer Guy AND Writer Guy are 99.99% of the time bang on, just HAD to watch this Pitch Meeting so see what I missed. I can safely say that it is very obvious I missed nothing. LOL!
Best beard in the galaxy 🙌🙌🙌
Sounds awful.
Yeah, the only good thing about this show seems to be that beard. That certainly IS the best beard in the galaxy.  Right now Disneys only virtue is being a good source for jokes and nasty reviews.
The "Ahsoka jumps out of the ship and meets Baylan" part is so ridiculously silly to me.  I mean what happened there? Did Ahsoka specifically jump out where she sensed Baylan to be? If so: why, if she had no intention of defeating him? Did he sense her and seek her out? If so, why did Ahsoka jump out this far away from her friends who are in danger? Was it just a coincidence? Aside from how ridiculous the odds of that happening are, again, why would she jump out of the ship this far away from her friends?  Even with it being left vague, I can't think of a single scenario where this makes a lick of sense.
You missed a Gandalf the white reference... like she comes back and is wearing all white like Gandalf Jesus....
My SSN is 455-12-+2+×  Birthday is 5-×5=25  on tatooine...    Mother's maiden name is Skywalker.    Bank is the Empire Bank number 555youcantmakethisup69  Hope this helps Ryan 😅
Stopping a fart is😳😱😬😖🥵... TIGHT!
I got an Ahsoka ad after this
Dave Filoni should change his name to "Dave Felony," because everything he writes is a high crime against the art of creative storytelling.  And his stupid hat reminds me of what Gunnery Sergeant Hartman said about the only two things that come out of Texas.
Also, I love that Ahsoka fans use Whataboutism arguments instead of defending the show on its own merits. Almost like there's nothing to defend. The TV series was a mistake.
You know, but it is still worth saying - the killing a fart line was spit-take worthy.  The blunt delivery with imagery worked perfectly.
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.
I was hoping that you would address the many unnecessarily long silent stares of the three main females characters. What the hell is up with that ?
Seeing a group of stormtroopers coming back to life and shambling around as zombies was insanely surreal, i can't believe Star Wars has come to that point
my name and social security number
This bit used to be funny when he was pointing out holes and inconsistencies that, like, I should have seen but didn't. Now that modern entertainment is so badly done, it's not funny. It's just pointing out the never ending idiocy of feminst, woke Hollywood. Ryan, for the sake of your audience, return to movies and TV that were actually entertaining.
The crazy thing about this pitch meeting is not only is it accurate but the ideas are so horrible half of them are hard to even laugh at. The writing is just that bad. Smh.
I mean.... you're not wrong lol
He absolutely has the best beard in the galaxy.
Some genuine belly laffs from this one!
Can u please do a pitch man on stargirl
Punisher Star Wars Zone and Anya Taylor Misery were the best characters.
I can feel how terrible this show is from Ryan's face😅
glad I skipped this one
Did you forget that Sabine Wren was a trained Mandalorian versed in basic Mando combat, an explosives expert, an expert marksman, a super talented engineer that no one could copy, a talented repair technician that is able to repair anything like ship engines and weapons, is able to defeat Clone Wars veteran Mandalorian soldiers like Gar Saxon in 1v1 combat, attended in the Imperial Academy, was a fantastic Tie fighter pilot, designed a super weapon (without any help) that baffles other Imperial/Rebel/Mandalorian Engineers, was a famous Bounty Hunter throughout the Galaxy and had other Bounty Hunters owe her favors, is able to wield a lightsaber without the force and fight Jedi 1v1, comes from a famous Mandalorian family (which is basically Royalty) and was a well known Galactic Artist because of her famous art......all before the age of 14 years old!  And now she's a Jedi and Force sensitive. Even surviving getting stabbed by a Lightsaber. 😂
The thumbnail had me rolling, I can't stop 😂😂😂😂
Sooo… this is Fem Star Wars .. I’ll pass. Not supporting the weirdo shit
Yet another fantastic pitch meeting. Loved this, and loved Ahsoka. This was very well done!
A movie about Indian Gods vs Egyptian Gods would be TIGHT.
So, you have a new idea for me? Well, not really. Not original anyway 😮
If you get immediate treatment gutshot wounds are not necessarily fatal. Morgan got no treatment, so she might have been aliveand survived  after gutting we will never know.
Calling it content for the sake of content isn't very fair. It's content for the sake of Filoni fixing all the plot holes that Disney farted out with the sequel movies.
Yeahhh… Ashoka had some plot holes. Bit of a shame. So corporate feeling
Get in a whale that travels to the exact spot in a galaxy they need to get to.   Lands on a planet at exactly right location to meet Ezra.   Yay Disney!
Oh man.  Looking right at the camera for extra emphasis.
Classic
The shows are so lazy you can pass the time by watching: - the characters who merely exist to inspire action figure and costume sales at Disney stores - the props designed for the same purpose  - picturing the actors shooting most of these scenes in a big green box, just grinding through the scenes with less care and creative inspiration than soap opera stars filming three episodes in one day
A Rubik's Sphere?  Not even a little bit o' Lament Configuration puzzle box?
I do tend to bathe alone 😅 had my cracking up in the first line
At least, the writers are original with their story writing.
5000
2:25 If Disney had purchased the rights to Harry Potter than Ahsoka could have hung out with Dumbledore's ghost.
Have to admit this is the best of star wars since rogue one
I care so little about these shows now, I barely enjoy the pitch meetings 😆
I think the Pitch Meeting was better than the whole Ahsoka series.
Clone Wars should have been the end of Ahsoka's story because they gave her the perfect send off. And then Rebels ruined her. That was such a bad show.
Isn't it weird how the sequel trilogy seemed to forget Vaders redemption at the end of episode 6, with Kylo worshipping the Vader helmet, and it seems suddenly they remember now?  I would say Kathleen needs to fire the whole writers room for not knowing what the hell they are doing, but she needs to go with them for signing off on this crap, over.... and over... and over again.
4:22 Achsually I believe Ashoka landed near Bailin because she couldn't risk going to Sabine first and then promption Bailing to come help her apprentice. Ahsoka also knew she would have a hard time defeating him, so she chose to stall him and steal his wolf-horse.
"best beard in the galaxy"..."what?"....so much funny in so little time 😂😂😂💚💚💚
Ryan did you just become a father because those dad jokes are brutal. 😅
I love ❤these guys 🤩 At least I know I will never watch this program. I laughed 😂 at Producer cuz He took offense at that Greatest Beard in the Universe  Comment!🤪
Good funny points 😂 still quite enjoyed the show but i can still enjoy pocking fun at something i like
WoW Even the pitch meeting suck.
I like it well enough, but the fact it’s just another step in a set up for a movie that’s still like three years away drags it down a lot
wait, did I miss the Barely an inconvenience line or did he not say it?
Wow am I glad I didn't watch this show.
I completely lost interest by the 3rd episode so thank you for the summary! I loved both animated Ashoka and Rosario Dawson so I had such high hopes. Live action Ashoka has absolutely none of the passion that her animated counterpart had.
I'm getting old: needed a second to get that "tibia" joke
So stoic and smirky! Such a great way to convey a strong female lead!
I didn't actually think Star Wars shows could get any worse than Kenobi. Then this garbage shits itself out and reminds me there's always a bigger fish.
Ugh even the pitch meeting about this show is kinda dull
Disney just love shamelessly raping any IP they own, don't they?
TSUKI HA SPIRITED AWAY PITCH MEETING SHIMASU! ONEGAISHIMASU PITCH SAN
❤
Thank you for summarizing the series, was already reluctant to watch it.
I used one of my last three videos I can watch before the player is locked out to watch this video.  Worth it.
"Baylan, who has Jedi powers & the best beard in the galaxy" is just objectively true, tbh.
I can't believe you forgot to mention the Eye of Sauron, Argonath and Mt. Doom!
the last episode of Ahsoka was the top of the bad writing
Look, Lightsaber are not normal swords. Since they burn, they actually cauterize the wound that it makes, and therefore, depending on where you get stabbed, it hurts real bad but saves you at the same time. Where Sabine got stabbed is not fatal and therefore, lightsaber didn’t kill her and stopped her from bleeding.
"All the storm troopers forget that they're holding guns."
I'm really glad I didn't bother watching this show. I didn't like the animated shows and since this is basically just another season of thsoe I don't care one bit
Best beard in the Galaxy. 😂
instead of a space whale, they should have fired up the halcyon. not like it's doing anything....
This show was really awkwardly avoiding Luke's existence. Ahsoka had a good death in Rebels, but she came back to life to sell merch and now the OT makes no sense with her and Luke being alive, Jedi and rebels at the same time
Anyone else think that these new Star Wars series are being written by a group of 12-year-olds jacked up on Mountain Dew  and Ritalin?
Watching this guy is super easy.... barely an inconvenience.
I am so glad I did not watch this show!
Happy you guys calling out the people at Disney :)
Another good show's ending ruined by cinematic universe Also why was Sabine the main character?
Destroys a fart 😂🤣
I agree with some of what he said, but if you watched and understood Star Wars rebels, there is a lot of backstory that explains quite a bit of what’s going on and why certain people can, and can’t do certain things, and why some of them do things that don’t make sense. There were still plenty of things that still didn’t make sense, but I believe overall it was a good series. Certainly better than the garbage that marvel has been putting out lately.
A lot of us still need to see this and probably won’t see this video until we do
I enjoyed the Ahsoka series.  I will admit it had far more potential.
I’m starting to hate these Disney plus series.  Nothing gets resolved. Every season ends on cliffhangers or gets retconned.  It’s not satisfying.
Ok, first you use "less" instead of "fewer" in your previous video, and I happened to also mention the whole abuse of "bring" versus "take."  And here you use "bring" instead of take.  Now you're just tormenting me.  I hope you're proud.  Knowing when to use "take" instead of "bring" is tight!  Remember, BRING it here.  Or TAKE it there.  BRING it to me  TAKE it to him.
Ahsoka is a great example of all Disney Star Wars shows now, just mediocre writing and cameos and fan service, the only good project we’ve gotten was the rogue one show
I love how Ryan has kept this kind of content up for years, without ever having a bad episode despite making 2 videos a week since 2018. The respect I have on this man
A lot of people have tried to explain how pointless this live action s05 of Rebels was to limited effect.  As usual, you nailed it.
Thanks for the video Ryan
Filoni wanted Ahsoka to be Gandlaf so much yet couldn't even produce 10% of the content that Lord of The Rings had (both in terms of quantity and quality).
I love how Ryan can destroy a show by simply describing what happens.
It's weird how annoyed I am that this one turned out be such a dud. I guess I've been hearing about Ahsoka for ages and gotten the impression that she's a really great character, and of course she's very visually distinctive. But I should have known that we don't get to have nice things things these days.
Yeah, not sure what was going on with this show. Feels like no Starwars project will ever hit the same high as the clone wars T.V series. Well other than the games.
“stopping a fart is tight” 💀
Oh, how I love these Pitch Mee.... OH, NO! MY IDENTITY'S BEEN STOLEN!!
What a waste.  It could have been good, but the screenwriters have apparently never watched a pitch meeting, ever.
Didn’t Ahsoka hold her sabers with the blades backwards? 😅
😅”Stopping a fart is tight” I see what you did there!!😂😂
More popular and more entertaining than the actual show. 😊
Can't spoil a show where nothing happened.
The lightsaber stab complaint is dumb, IMO. Sabine was not hit in the spine like Qui-Gon, and she gets immediate medical attention. Maul survived being chopped in half. This is not new to Star Wars, it just seems like people on the internet desperately needing to complain about as much as possible.
Are you still in a contract with screenrant? or maybe do they partially own this channel?
That bad huh?
I expected this series to be bad, I heard it was awful, now I see it was pathetically ridiculous and everyone involved in the show ought to be ashamed and sent to a penal colony.
the lack of names and SSNs down here is insulting
Love how he actually cracked character for a sec when he brought up her getting out of the ship to fight in space. 😂 One of the dumbest shows ever.
Disney writers have gotten really obsessed with maps leading to characters. Theyve used it in Force Awakens, Rise of Skywalker, and now this.
that confused "But..." expression is so good, I had the same expression at least once per episode of Ashoka lol
Has the office background noise been in other videos?  I haven't noticed it before but found it really distracting in this one.
That sounds *SO INCREDIBLY BORING!!*  (I mean the actual series, I still enjoyed Ryan mocking it, lol)
"and nobody calling her out on that"  I didn't understand how nobody told how selfish she was, so many people will die because of her decision
OMG "Stopping a fart it tight" 😂🤣😂 2:13
man this series was a complete waste and a mess
It totally boggles my mind that these pitch meetings are more interesting, entertaining and memorable than the show they're talking about. Yes, I said ""they". Because producer guy and writer guy are two different people, obviously.
Even the writer guy found fighting a fighter plane in space with your lightsaber hilarious
I laughed too hard at the tibia joke  😭🤣
I'm surprised you didn't talk about green lady(can't recall the name right now),      and how all she did the whole show was abuse power, disobey orders, get people killed, and commit perjury. And apparently, she was a good guy or something that totally needed to be there.
Ass-oka looks like yet another really bland & boring Disney effort. Thank God Ryan can make it interesting for a few minutes 👍
Thank you for calling out all of the gigantic plot holes and just crap writing in this show. Disney needs to cancel all of these shows and just focus on Andor.
This show was the final straw that had me cancelling my Disney+ subscription. How did writing get so incredibly bad?
No surprise, this reading made it sound a lot less stupid and far more entertaining than the show actually was.
1:53  he couldn't even hide the laugh haha
"Tickled by a lightsaber"😂😂
Did you just get a haircut so Writer Guy and Producer Guy could look different?
HOW CANT SHE REALIZE TO TWIST IT THREE TIMES? This is the worst writing I’ve ever seen in a Star Wars show. The Vespa scene in book of boba fett isn’t even as bad as this.
In defence of the show, giant space whale *are* how Thrown and Ezra got out to the other galaxy in the first place.  :)  But I do love how even Producer Guy doesn't see any threat in Stormtroopers.
The only value of this garbage is the content roasting it. Which I’m sure Hollywood factors into the production
3:13 - "She gets inside a whale?" Yeah, Disney figured they'd try that in -A$$ Soaker- Ahsoka because it was SO successful in their live-action remake of -Pistachio- Pinocchio. 🤣  Thrawn: Lt. Cmdr. Data from Star Trek: TNG with a blue filter and one-eighth the charisma.
Glad I didn’t watch Ashoka. Why can’t Disney hire semi-competent writers? Oh, that’s right, they.have connections instead, and we all know connections always create amazing content, right? 😂
So. In Book of Boba Fett, they stole Silver’s cyborg Swiss Army utility arm from Treasure Planet and in Ahsoka they stole the map to Treasure Planet itself?
"Who is this tibia person who attacked her?" Gold!!!
"Tickled by a lightsaber." 😂😂😂 Exact how I felt about it. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Also: Starship weapons vs people scale...deflected just fine 😑 Banking on memories of Old Cannon Thrawn instead of what they've shown us...and not spending tome building him up as a worthy villain. And the Grumpy-Grumpy, Frown-Town of character personalities.
I re-watched this video immediately. There is no way I will ever re-watch Ahsoka. I'm pretty certain in 3 years time I'll have trouble remembering much about it at all.
There was no wow wow wow wow wow wow
Sometimes when a show is particularly badly written, we'll keep watching it just to try and figure out what moment Writer Guy will say was, "Super easy, barely an inconvenience."
It was also super easy, barely an inconvenience to dodge every blast from a Star Destroyer that was directly above the characters. If that's all Thrawn meant by "raining hellfire", he might be easier to defeat than we think.
Ezra coming off the ship with his helmet still on was so damn cringe.  Any writer willing to put that tiny shred of dramatic effect above common sense should just quit and go answer phones at Comcast.
We've been getting so much shit star wars content that when something that is barely watchable or use anakin just to get a few views everyone looses their fucking head
I am so astounded but still utterly confused and how this talented gentleman with these videos  Is able to show how all these TV shows and movies are so bad nowadays yet he works for screen rent man who kisses  The ass of all this bad crap Saying it's the best thing ever especially saying Ahsoka was great.  I tell you it's so contradicting I can't make heads or tails of these 2 entities working together.  Please somebody explain to me how this gentleman and screen rant worked together???
Strong woman characters are tight. Amazing.
Lol...I said that same thing when watching Ezra come out of the ship with the helmet on 😜
They did Rebels so dirty in this. I can't even...
I am disappointed by the fact that Ryan didn’t mention how Ahsoka in the second half of the season was basically Gandalf the White
Disney has become such garbage it's pure comedy now.
It was so bad 😔
I'm so glad dollar store joker could cameo in this episode
Here we are, however many episodes in, and I am *still* laughing at "Super easy, barely an inconvenience".  I will say the movies keep getting stupider though.
Im glad the original 3 Star Wars movies were so good I can just watch them over and over.
Is the similarity between the ball map and the simple-shape gateway in Asoka and the ball map and simple-shape gateway in treasure planet as apparent to anyone else? I haven’t seen the series, so I can’t speak to the similarities as plot devices, but the imagery is definitely there, right?
I need to go back and rewatch Rebels, but I don’t recall Sabine being force sensitive.
I got so annoyed at way too much arm crossing! I stopped watching, but I think over a month later, I saw that there was a lightsaber fight with Anakin, a clip on YouTube, so I went back to check it out and it really made the show better
Anyone who says Producer Guy and Writer Guy are the same person must truly have something wrong with them.  Look, they even have different haircuts!  How could they possibly be the same!?
Disney could have gotten someone better than Elon Musk to play Thrawn. Come on.
Ahsoka 8.6 out of 10
As I watched some of the more senseless scenes in the series, I thought of nothing but of how Ryan was going to let Disney know that some of the plotlines were stupid.
I like how Ryan seemed to legitimately have trouble keeping a straight face while describing Ahsoka fight ships.
I enjoyed watching this show (especially the shameless Anakin cameo, what can I say?) but damn the more I think about it the more I hate how much it sucks. XD  Still not as bad as TBOBF.
Please! Make a pitch meeting for the one piece live action!!
Ahsoka is my absolute favorite Star Wars character, so this show just really made me mad. 😡   SABINE SHOULDN’T HAVE THE FORCE!!!!! 😭😡😭
I know he doesn't make these videos out of a mean sentiment to criticize shows and movies, but it feels good and refreshing to see that there are people out there who understand and pay attention to how dumb and horrible Star Wars has become. I never thought I'd say this, but I feel no urge to watch it anymore. I might go back in time to Clone Wars though.
“She learns it is better to live than to die” 😂😂😂
Since maps constantly lead to bad guys, then that means Jake Skywalker in The Last Jedi was a bad guy
Nice touch with the Producer guy hair cut!!
Excellent Pitch Meeting. I will say that the space whale hyperspace is at the very least somewhat reasonable as that’s how Ezra and Thrawn got to the other galaxy in the first place, but it’s still a huge risk to take lol
Nailed it! We have been waiting for this pitch meeting ever since we saw the hyper space whales😂. Pure genius💥💥💥
The best beard in the galaxy. What?
How was there a map in the first place
Maybe these projects bomb because they're made by a guy with multiple personality disorder lol
This show is not evidence of human trafficking that can be proven in court through witness testimony. No one is about to get their ass sued out of all of their assets. Please carry on.
Did these two notable Guys have different haircuts????????
Thank you, it saved me watching yet another KK SW Train Wreck.
Nice. Still waiting for last of us hbo or bird box barcelona pitch meeting by the way thanks for the heads up about social security number
Ya Disney definitely took a giant plop with this shit. Elon Thrawn was dumb as hell. His whole plan was a giant turd. Fuckin hell.
so they stole the 4D whales from Futurama? and to think i used to long for more Star Wars
Disney starwas is just always such quality content. "Thought provoking" may not quite capture it, but it is certainly provoking.
Did they just straight up Gandalf Ahsoka in this one? Actually, it's more like Harry and Dumbledore. Clearly, our brains can no longer come up with anything new.
Zombie stormtroopers are self-referential to the entire StarWars franchise.
I was expecting producer guy the white to show up after ahsoka came back from the world between worlds
Wait the map is just literally the exact same map as the one from Treasure Planet?
How about a pitch meeting for Swordfish, Knives Out, and Glass Onion?
"So they can easily dispatch the zombie stromtroopers by cutting off their limbs, right?" "Hey shut up! So they run away and close blast door behind them to try to slow them down."
Ryan got some new shirts, I see.
Jesus Christ Ahsoka gets worse and worse. Whatever you do - do NOT think about it. Oh you forgot the ship magically fucking repairing itself. Dogshit.
I've been looking forward to this pitch meeting.
I wonder if anyone is ever gonna talk about how Hera in this show was actually just kinda an awful person?
😎🙏💯
I liked this show quite a bit and the heavier use of fantasy magic in Star Wars.  And I think with Baylan it was more about getting to that planet than finding Thrawn.  Maybe in the Galaxy where Star Wars takes place it’s all about the force and technology.  But the galaxy they went to is more about dark magic. Maybe that’s the unimaginable power he mentioned.
I love Ahsoka but there were so many holes in this series, inconsistency, and the complete lack of using the force to move the "key" during the fight.
Producer Guy calling the not-Sith apprentice Tibia Lady is a cool callback to the “Old” pitch meeting. He really could have been a doctor…
i was so fucking high when i wached your vidoes, i had to watch this twice, so i loved all 6 times.
"tibia person" was my favorite!!!
"Tickled by a lightsaber...."
I think a joke was missed at the beginning, "So you have a new idea for me?"  "No sir, I don't.  But here's a pitch for a show!"
3PO?
How you act in this Pitch Meeting is my favorite version of your character.
yup. thrawn was my #1 favorite star wars character before this show. ahsoka was like top 15? this show was sooo boring. i stopped watching halfway through the damn season. a great summary of a bland, badly written show. they had some very charismatic actors that they squeezed in to blank faced nothings.
About three episodes into this show I started thinking "Oh I can't wait until the Pitch Meeting comes out".
That's why I stopped watching Disney. You can only get plopped on so much before you find something else to do.
Not good! With emphasis... I felt like that was directed at me personally.
😂😂😂
I really wanna go back to a few of the people a decade ago telling me it was better and will make more sense and be more organized expanded lore wise for Disney to have Star Wars than Lucas and his groups...I realllllly want a time machine at this point, maybe I can make some money off of it
Can you do The Iron Giant Pitch Meeting?
Im gonna be the Star Wars nerd and point out that the Space Whales have seasonal migration paths from galaxy to galaxy, and Ezra and Thrawn got lost by following the Space Whales so odds were good the Space Whales would lead to where Thrawn had been marooned. If the Space Whales were anything like real whales, they have seasonal migrations that lead them to their feeding and birthing spots across thousands of miles.
It's hilarious how many of these issues you point out I literally said to myself as I scoffed and watched this pile of shit.
God I wanted to like this show so much…
Another example of the Pitch Meeting being so much better than the source material.
Watching this saved me 9 hours and a Disney + subscription. Oh Really?
That Shin/Tibia joke was way funnier than it had any right to be. Well done.
"So who was this Tibia woman who attacked her?" "Shin." That was pretty clever. XD
Have you done a pitch meeting for The Room? Or The Disaster Artists? Those would be great.
Lightsaber lady 😂😂.
I fell asleep half way through the pitch meeting because the idea was so bad. I’m not sure why producer guy was excited to hear the whole pitch.
I'm so glad I got to READ about the extended Star Wars Universe before Disney turned it into complete shit. Mandalorians have no idea what "this is the way" is. It's fucking stupid
Was there a haircut between the 2 recordings?
Ryan isda real MVP, Imagine watching the entire series and breaking it down for us so we dont have to suffer like he did.
The space whales were the coolest thing 😂😂
Saved me from watching that hot mess. Thanks again.
Yeah that’s all that I recall happening too. Standing, staring, swapping places.
Disney destorying Start wars is so sad to see lmao.
So Asohka basically pulled a Gandalf ? (Haven't watched the show...as someone said in the comments "Watching the Pitch Meeting instead of the show is tight !"
Jesus! I thought this show was stupid when I watched reviews on Disapru’s channel. Somehow you made it seem even dumber.
Nice producer haircut
I've not seen Ahsoka but I get the distinct impression that this Pitch Meeting summarised it perfectly and was a great deal more entertaining.
"Ezra Bridger" sounds less like a Star Wars character and more like a 19th century farmer.
Anyone else notice how Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy have different hairstyles? First time that’s ever happened!
I stopped watching this train-wreck show 3 episodes in, thank you pitch meeting for proving I made the right choice.
My Social Security number is 6. It was one of the first ones they gave out.
4:45 : One of my biggest 'complaints' about Star Wars: Storm Troopers are no threat, just a time waste when the main characters are under a ticking clock.
OH MY GOSH THE SHIN/TIBIA JOKE AHAHAHAAAA I literally was like "I'm not gonna remember these names, I'll just try to follow along" and so when Producer Guy said "Tibia" I just accepted it without question, and then Screenwriter Guy corrected him to Shin and my brain started trying to figure it out XD
Star Wars is always bringing back dead characters as slower less effective zombies.. now they’re not even trying to hide it😅
You think Kathleen Kennedy would have figured out by now that no one wants her dumb WOKE crap. But that's ok. It's only been 8 years.
"Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience" is slowly starting to become my favorite phrase after binging a lot of these pitch meetings
Agents of Shield did Snarky Thin Blue Guys like 6 years ago. Snore, Star Wars. Big ol' snore.
“Content for the sake of content” is what a lot of shows these days feel like
This sums my feelings on that terrible series up pretty well, no one did anything in that series. Every episode you were left thinking I guess something will happen next episode, and then it never did and the series ended.
It was so fun seeing them ruin Thrawn it wasn't enough that they ruined every other character from the OT Disney then had to take characters from the EU that they themselves said were no longer canon and ruin them too.
Its very telling that when Ryan says "slap a nostalgia cameo on this" I was fully expecting Hayden Christenson, and went: oh yeah, 3P0 too.
I did find it amusing that they had Sabine get impaled by a lightsaber but it didn't seriously impede anything, because that's been pretty much an insta-kill in every other piece of Star Wars media.
F for star wars.
Star wars is turning stupid.
I wonder who thinks which one looks like who
Producer guy and writer guy have two different haircuts. Maybe they ARE two people.
“Ohhh….stopping a fart is tight!”  I just spat out my coffee. 🤣🤣💀🤣
Stuck the landing
Thrawn in the canon books: complicated hero. Thrawn in the canon shows: generic bad guy.
"Oooo stopping a fart is tight!". Havent laughed at a fart joke in decades, and this one got me. 😂😂
Thank you for doing this. Id much rather watch this than the show.
Apparently, people will watch anything with the Star Wars name attached to it.
Hi Ryan! Please do a Pitch Meeting for The Room!
Watching this pitch meeting was super-easy, barely an inconvenience.
Downfall of Disney 😑
I wanted to watch this series, then I watched the first episode and it was bad, so I watched this. Thanks for saving 6 hours of my life, buddy!
WTF? When has Thrawn been about Genocide?
I had heard it was bad, but this summary just made me shake my head. What have you become Disney?
I feel like there is a missed opportunity for a joke about a blue data from star trek.... or just a joke about star trek and "hey wrong universe".... there's definitely something there
Did you forget that Hera is also in this show?! I mean sure the actual writers and producers forgot, but how could you?!?! 😂😂😂😂😂
A map that leads to Luke Skywalker was a video game quest like cheap McGuffin, but a map to Thrawn is a fresh and new idea. 😂
The sad part is, the show was more ridiculous than anything that Mr. George could write. Can't believe people stanned this show and were giving it top ratings. Those jangling keys are really OP!
Thrawn is blue Elon Musk
Didn't watch the show and now I know I never will have to. Thanks Writer Guy and Producer Guy!
I was gonna type random digits for the social security number, but I'm worried some random guy would get their identity stolen.
I'll never tire of this bit.
Just got a new kitana, gonna go F-22 hunting.
writer guy should be wearing cowboy hat
I did not like this thumbnail, it was not good, very much an inconvenience.
Oi!🤦‍♂️
isn`t that map from the Treasure Planet? Are we gonna see Jimbo and Delbert?
The tibia joke... phenomenally delivered and delightfully clever! I just wanted to make sure that got the credit it was do 😂
Aho-sucka Toe-a. Love seeing Disney burn 🔥
I tried the first episode, and I appreciate this sketch for condensing my inevitable heavy sighs at this show
2:19 I need to start using “for a death” more 😂
Most of these series including in Marvel are pretty much unnecessary and even moreso forgettable.
First
the creators had some real nerve putting ray stevenson in such an awful show
Pew pew pew
Lightsabers took down an actual fighters jets 🎉  did nothing but a stupid stomachache on a person 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Name: Ryan SSN: 555-55-5555
The show so boring even the pitch meeting is boring.
Lol, holy shit! The scene with her attacking the ships with her lightsabers out in space is real? Hahahaha
Ahsoka was possible one of the most cringe shows I have ever tried to watch
Tibia to Shin and back made me laugh hard enough to lose my breath... the dead pan delivery between the characters is phenomenal at this point
1min 30sec in and already 5 women and 1 guy. Gotta love that Disney "message"
Ahsoka has finally broken my hope that disney star wars can be good. Cancelled my disney+ subscription. I’m done.   Yo ho yo ho…
Not one "Elon" slip-up in that whole spiel.😎
Well sounds like this show was influenced by a lot of other actually good shows not stealing just inspiration.
You're awesome dude. You're one of the few on youtube et at that created something totally unique and kept it going without bastardizing it all. I hope you make tons of money and get a nice place wherever you think is the best for you.
You have saved me so much time that I might have spent watching this show 🙏
"Hey, didn't Qui Gon Jinn, a really powerful Jedi, and Han Solo both immediately die getting impaled by lightsabers?"  "Shut up, the lightsaber stabbing isn't fatal now."
Alright, I love you guys.....but ahsoka was good. So dammit producer guy!!!!
"Tickled by lightsaber"🤣
I didn't ask for a vague Rebels ending to be made unvague.
Good vid broski
Where is Anakin, is he safe? Is he alright?
The phone ringing in the back of the office was tight
Pitch Meetings are one of the few videos i click the like button before the video even starts. always amazing work!
And yet the show remains awesome 😊
Wait a minute. I thought it's Ahsoka. But why everything is about Sabine?
Did you record this on two different days?  Producer Guy's hair looks shorter than Screenwriter Guy's.
Have you heard that if you write your social security number in coments it gets filtered? HERE: ***-**-***
Storm Troopers tend to be very dumb when they are around Ezra.
Definitely funny. This show was sick tho. Finally star wars is good again
Looks like I dodged another bullet 😂
Those guys have different haircuts!!!
jeez, watching a pitch meeting for something you actually know a lot about reveals how incredibly ignorant, intentionally or not, of character growth and themes these videos are. still enjoy them tho!
I love it when pitch meeting releases new videos, but goddamn Hollywood is just shitting the bed left right and center. Screen writing is so bad that pitch meeting could literally just copy & paste the original script and it's still as funny.
We didn't get a writer's strike joke in there at all?
Netflix One Piece Pitch Meeting when?
As an anthropology student i really appreciate the shin/tibia joke lol
Jesus, Andor is really the only good Star Wars since Empire
Writer Guy: So Then Ahsoka Tells Sabine Who Has Every Bad Reason To Go Rogue "HEY!......... Don't You Take That Ball. I'm Gonna Leave It With You...... But Don't You Take It." Producer Guy: And Then? Writer Guy: She Immediately Takes It. Producer Guy: So Why Did Ahsoka Trust Her? Writer Guy: Because Producer Guy: That...... Doesn't Really Work. Writer Guy: Oh........ Oh Really????????? Usually That Works. Producer Guy: Yeah It's Just This Seems Like An Obviously Stupid Thing To Do. Writer Guy: Well To Be Fair Sir, A Lot Of The Things That Go On This Season Hinge Specifically On Characters Making Poor Choices To Keep Things Going. Producer Guy: So We're Cobra Kai-ing This Writer Guy: Yeah Pretty Much. Producer Guy: Like In What Other Ways? Writer Guy: Well It Seems Like The New Order Is Just BEYOND INCOMPETENT When It Comes To Keeping Former Imperialists In Check That They Employ. Producer Guy: They're Employing The Bad Guys And Just Trusting Them? Writer Guy: Yeah And Also One Guy On The Council Is Just Soooooo Stupid & Annoying You'd Think He Either Is Too Stupid To Whipe His Own Butt Or Is A Traitor. Producer Guy: So Do We Find Out What His Deal Is? Writer Guy: NOPE! Producer Guy: Oh Dang It. Writer Guy: And Then Rather Than Quickly Taking Out A Bad Guy Together So They Can Stay Together Like Adviced, Ashoka Leaves Sabine Alone To Handle The Jedi Who Impaled Her Earlier. Producer Guy: Does That Work Out. Writer Guy: Well Sabine Doesn't Beat Her And Ashoka Gets Overwhealmed While Not Fighting With Both Sabers. Producer Guy: Let Me Guess, I Say "Why" You Say "Because". Writer Guy: Pretty Much. Producer Guy: Yikes Writer Guy: And Then Sabine Makes A Selfish Choice And Gives The Bad Guys What They Want. Producer Guy: She Doesn't Sound Very Likeable. Writer Guy: She Isn't, No. In Fact, A Lot Of The Characters From Rebels Are Kind Of "Meh" In Live Action Compared To The Show. Producer Guy: That Reminds Me, Is This Show Going To Be A Struggle For Anyone Who Didn't Watch Rebels. Writer Guy: OH UNBELIEVABLY SO! Producer Guy: You Think That's A Good Idea. Otherwise They'd Have To Binge Through A Whole Serious Or Get A Cliffnotes Version Of It And Not Feel Much For These Characters And The Loyal Fans Might Be Dissapointed For How Poorly They're Portrayed Writer Guy: HeyShutUpSoThen Also None Of The New Republic Go Along With Ahsoka To Go Save Sabine With The Whales. Producer Guy: Got It. RIght That Makes No Sense. Writer Guy: And Then Sabine Puts The Galaxy In Mortal Danger & Makes Ezra's Sacrifice For Nothing But Doesn't Get Skolded For It. Producer Guy: That's Not Good. Writer Guy: And Then The Bad Guy Is Gonna Say To His Apprentice "Hey.... Why Don't You Handle This Yourself. This Is YYour Path.... And Mine Is Elsewhere Producer Guy: Sounds Like Bull Crap To Give A Cheap Excuse For The Good Guys Surviving. Writer Guy: Oh It Most Definitely Is. And Then Ahsoka And The Others Let Her Go. Producer Guy: DUMB SMART Writer Guy: And Then Once Again Rather Than Just Taking Out A Villain Together Quickly To Move Forward, Sabine & Ezra Leave Ashoka On Her Own. Producer Guy: Oh Never Learning From Your Screw Ups Is TIGHT! Writer Guy: And So Things Don't Go Smoothly, Sabine Stays Behind While Just Ezra Escapes, And She And Ahshoka Are Now Stuck On This Planet With A Bunch Of Cute Little Merchandising Opportunities. Producer Guy: And Ezra Writer Guy: Safe & Sound Producer Guy: But The Galaxy Isn't Writer Guy: Right, Because Of Thrawn Producer Guy: And If Sabine Had Just Let Ashoka Handle The Ball Map, They Could Have Found Ezra Without Letting Thrawn Escape And Everyone Would Be Fine. Writer Guy: Pretty Much Producer Guy: Sounds Like A VERY UNLIKEABLE Character. Writer Guy: Yeah But It's Star Wars And We're Setting Up For Thrawn's Story. Producer Guy: And There Wasn't A Way To Do This Without People Making Such OBVIOUS DUMB CHOICES. Writer Guy: I Mean We Could......... But We'd Have To..... You Know Try. Procuder Guy: Yuck! Writer Guy: And Pay Us Writers Fair Wages. Producer Guy: DUMB PATH IT IS!!!!
Are those map from treasure planet😱
"Tickled by a lightsaber"...GOLD!
Managed to cut a fart absolutly killed me!!
Fuck I'm glad I didn't bother with this show 😂
I'll say this for stormtroopers, they're definitely consistent
"Holding back a fart is tight."   You've done it Ryan. You've reached the 5th wall.
Because of you, and that "tickled by a lightsaber" joke, my neighbors probably think I laugh at late-night poos.   Also E-Thron Musk.  Remember when using the force was difficult to just lift objects, and at the most extreme, a bit of lightning... simpler times.
I don't need disney because you do a great job.
I feel Ahsoka from the Ahsoka series isnt the same Ahsoka from the Mandalorian series....
Oooooh stopping a fart is tight!
Watching people defend this show, hurts my brain.
one piece next
For a swim? For a death! Oh?!
😂🤣😂 Actually laughed out loud at this 😂🤣😂  I actually enjoyed watching Ahsoka. It was light, somewhat fluffy, star wars themed filler to move the story along interspersed with some awesomeness... so you know Rebels season 5 but live action.  ...this was 100% on point and hilarious (as always) 😂🤣😂  I  think they should have done the series as animated and just called it rebels part 2... Or "The Republic" seeing as their no longer rebels. It would have fixed most of my complaints and allowed them to keep Sabine and Ahsoka as their more likeable versions. But I can understand why they wanted to move Thrawn to live action universe.
To be fair, cross armed stoic and smirky IS Ahsoka's character in Clone Wars lol
Leave it to Disney Star Wars to make the prequels look like masterpieces of cinema in comparison.
"So who's this Tibia?"  "Shin"  "What did I say?"  Genius as always. XD
1:16 had me dying
There is no canon in Disney Star War.
Sabine had no choice.   1. She shoots the map: nothing happens lol. We saw how long the saber took to melt it. A Blaster bolt would've done nothing.  2. She throws the Map: Baylan uses the force to catch it.  3. She gives it to him and hopes she doesn't die.   I don't ever want to hear that sabine betrayed us
Love the snaky tibia joke, well played sir
Is it bad that I was thinking about Ryan's commentary while watching the show?
I didnt watch the show, so wait she pulls a gandolf and becomes a white wizard? Then pulls a Geppetto? man people are really running out of ideas.
Name: Tony Stark SSN: 5
Obi-Wan barely gets touched on the shoulder by a lightsaber and immediately dissolves into air in the first movie. Now people can get impaled by lightsabers and it's "tis but a scratch."
Ahsoka should've dropped the map in that explosion lol.
Oh so another waste of time Star Wars show. Who coulda guessed that? 😂
Wow... just wow... ... ... You got through this shit with just one sarcastic laugh! Well done...! ;D
My name is Cthulhu and my security number is 55555555555555555…..
Can't explain it but Producer guy is chubbier than Writer guy
I need the emperor to get all the way off my back
You forgot about how Thrawn left all the doors open at the tower
Stomping A Fart Is TIght Getting Tickled By A Light Saber Is Tight Getting Inside A Space Whale Is Tight
Long live Producer Guy and Writer Guy, saving me from watching terrible shows
I’ll say, in defense of this show, Dave Filioni has a history of making a bad first season to build on. Clone wars and Rebels were both like this. What I didn’t like the most, which I hope is corrected, is how much the original characters changed. Granted, we can’t forget Sabine’s entire family was killed on Mandalore during the purge, Ahsoka still felt the guilt from Anakin. These are all things these characters had to grow through.  What I really hoped we saw was Thrawn and Ezra just chilling with each other, but that didn’t happen. I kinda want to see more flashbacks with them.
I'm calling it now. Sabine is the reason the Empire takes over again in the sequels
Honestly a shame. After Andor one hoped Star Wars could find a better path. But nope. Even managed to set on path of waste such character like Thrawn...
SHIN , TIBIA,
Just for the sabine lightsaber stabbing and surviving, that is so nonsensical in relation to star wars 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Watching Pitch Meeting instead of the actual show and avoiding disappointment and a waste of time is TIGHT!
It was such a horrible show.
First time seeing them with different haircuts.
Pitch Meetings 🤝🏽 Honest Trailers. Dropping around the same time
What a dumpster fire this series was.
actually hilarious how garbage the show is
Anyone who legitimately likes ashoka has something wrong with them
great
Tickled by a lightsaber is a brilliant way to describe just how far such a sacred, mystical weapon has fallen
I love the fact that Ryan’s Producer Guy has a haircut and Writer Guy doesn’t. A nice little detail.
The Shin-Tibia joke was top tier
At this point the Star Bores series is so weak Ryan has to be super super gentle lest they turn to dust.
Some of these I really agree with, like the ships just not shooting the immobilized ship in space but Ahsoka. Only thing I am fine with is Sabine using a force push which actually looked like it took effort not to mention she had at least been trying to practice, unlike Rey who could just Jedi mind trick out the gate.
can't imagine how low your standards for entertainment must be to pay for and spend time watching this garbage
Is the audio de-synced for anyone else?
Zombie stormtroopers 😂
I didn't realize it was so bad. Ryan George is the only reason I keep updated about Star Wars 😂
I am completely baffled by the selection of Dawson for this role. She literally brings nothing to it, that a block of wood couldn't do for free. I am going to tremendously enjoy not watching this pile of garbage.
Disney is really taking us for braindead morons aren't they.. ? ^^'
Not watching Ashoka is easy bearly an……
Best Star Wars content nowadays are the video games, by far. Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor are great. None of the bullshit in this cheap-ass shows.
The part of the whales taking Ashoka and sabine to the exact galaxy they wanted to go.. lol hahah anyway actually in the show itself the droid says the same to her so.. Even "Disney" thought about the people questioning this exactly. sorry for my English
This is my new favorite Pitch Meeting! The entire thing is pure gold.
like many times is better to watch this, that waste time watching the movie or series
Yeah...that sounds about right lol
Remember when fans whipped themselves into a frenzy theorizing that the faceless Inquisitor guy was Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Starkiller, and he turned out to be a fart?
"He will bring war and genocide." War, yes. Thrawn isn't the type of guy to do genocide. In Canon and Legends, that's not who thrawn is. He's a tactician not a monster!!
funnily enough, for other pitch-meetings he has to cut parts of the story out in order to make it a short video. Luckily here it was not nececary since there happens so little.
I feel like I watched the show. So riveting and enthralling. 10 out of 10, would recommend!
Please do "The Creator" next.  Lots of opportunities for discussion about nonsensical plot holes.
Ep7: Find Map to Luke, Ep 9: Find Map to Palpatine, Mando S2:Find Map to Jedis then Find Map to Gideon, Ahsoka: Find Map to Thrawn.
Written by children for children.
Loved how Ryan cleverly said Aksoka was a big flop 😂.
Tibia person!  Next level stuff right there
There’s no way Hera would recognize old Ezra. He was maybe 15 at the end of Rebels
I enjoyed Ahsoka, but this was spot on.
Spot on as always.
It turns out Thrawn was sneaky.
"They team up with a witch named Morgan" "A witch named Morgan? You mean like Morgan le Fay the arthurian witch?" "The same! Oh and we will name a few episodes as a cheeky reference to that legend as well!" "References are tight!"
This pitch meeting was way better than the actual show. Nice.
One of these days we're gonna have "Steamed Hams but it's a Pitch Meeting video".
"That Thrawn guy is supposed to be really smart. But writing smart characters is hard, so I just made him good at finding silver linings when his plans fail instead, and hopefully that will make it look like he's a strategic genius."
Show is a solid 2 outta 10
I can’t wait for the continuity in the next one where producer guy has long hair and writer guy is bald
Stopping a fart is tight. 😂 get it?
Wow.  And that's why I don't watch Star Wars movies or shows.  Not anymore since the sequel trilogy.  Absolute garbage.  Won't watch.
“And then she realizes its a good thing to be alive and now dresses in light clothes instead of dark clothes”  Oh doing a gandalf is TIGHT!
Ryan, your take on anything is better than the original.  I wish your content came out as trailers, so people really knew how bad some of the movies/ shows are.
Zombie stormtroopers? why not?, all the bad guys have dual lazy eyes to explain why no one can shoot straight? let's do it, Space witches and a blue guy pretending everything is just part of his convoluted plan, let's go, with special ed tier writing like this we can't fail.
Hilarious! This show was *HOT GARBAGE* .. So business as usual for Disney.
surprised he didnt mention when talking about the zombie stormtroopers, that lightsabers are the ONE fantasy weapon that immediately negates that danger. Just tapping someone dismembers them and literally unarms them... at least it... should... normally...
I only hear how disappointed you are in this show.
Its funny because the show is bad.
Wow this sounded terrible.
Yeah. Disney really running out of ideas. The bottom of the barrel is well and truly scraped.
Hey Ryan, awesome work as always! Just wanted to get in on what you were talking about at the end, i got distracted and didnt hear everything but i believe you needed this info. My name is Smith Jones and my social is 1. hope that helps man, take care!
Nowadays the Hollywood feels like “LOOK THE THING YOU KNOW ABOUT IS HERE!” “ISN’T THIS A COOL SCENE?” “DON’T ASK QUESTIONS & BUY OUR PRODUCTS” “WE WANT MONEY & PUBLICITY WITHOUT ANY SOUL”
Tbf sabine kinda had to hand it to them or they would kill her.
This whole hair cut thing is blowing my mind rn
This is the first time I've felt a pitch meeting *completely* missed the mark. I love you Ryan George but this watched like if you had written the Infinity War pitch meeting without watching any previous MCU titles.
Star Wars is so dead
Name: Ryan George SSN: 159375820
I like how Suckbean gets stabbed with a deadly laser sword and the worst thing that happens to her is a lesbian haircut…. Star War!
Not o my was the plot line bad but the dialogue writing was equally as terrible and cringy.
Was a big Clone Wars fan, tweeted and wrote letters to save the show when it was cancelled but now I couldn't care less about this show see what the mouse did.
Dave Filoni, ladies and gentle women.
I want a pitch meeting for Andor. I know it was a good show that why i want to see how that pitch meeting will play out. May this time, it is the producer pitching the script to the writer. The writter would ask stupid question about the plot and the producer will answer them logically.
This was another series where they threw a bunch of action figures in a bag and pulled out what should make an appearance
This guy...err...I mean these guys, need to be protected at all cost. Lolol always freakin' hilarious
I have to say Producer Guy's wardrobe is looking unnecessarily snappy and I'm loving it!!
No one calling Sabine out about risking the fate of the entire Galaxy to save one person was the most disappointing part of the entire show. Thrawn did more to call out her selfishness than the heroes! The Ahsoka and Anakin dynamic in the previous episode was so compelling because while they cared about each other there was still tension due to their different perspectives about what it means to do the right thing and Ashoka’s feelings of betrayal. Ahsoka dealing with similar things with her own padawan would have been interesting. So much wasted potential.
Just the worst. Well, the worst after all the other shows (except maybe Mando S1). And maybe also the sequels.   Disney rules!
Ryan's Pitch Meeting is the closest I'll ever get to seeing this show. And from what I've heard far more entertaining.
Watching this instead of the show so I know I missed nothing is super easy! Barely an inconvenience!
R.I.P. Star Wars
I liked this much more than the series itself.
Have you ever thought about doing these for movies that weren’t released.
So glad I don't have to waste my time watching this shit show.
I like how you can tell how tired he is of Disney's crap, as are we all. Haha
This man popped up on my recommendations and all I can say is welcome, good sir! 😎
I honestly think for these Disney shows Ryan could do literally the same pitch over and over and it would fit for almost all of the shows
I feel like Pitch Meeting and Honest Trailers are just gradually and begrudgingly admitting the problems caused by woke Hollywood (that Nerdrotic identifies plainly) without actually calling out the far left ideology specifically.
LOOK, THEIR HAIR IS DIFFERENT! This is indisputable proof Ryan and George are two different people!
Honestly, all of these star wars shows make me want to avoid ever getting Disney plus. Congratulations Disney, you made me hate Star Wars. Disney doesn't seem to hate gay people, people of color, women, or any other marginalized group, so why do they hate the fans of the IP's they own?
this was so much better than honest trailers bs take.. this one is comedic and points out some silly star wars things.. show is still awesome. honest trailers came off as an OT manbaby
This channel used to poke fun at movies and shows, but it has just become standard hater content about everything. The channel has lost its heart...
Releasing content for the sake of content like Producer Guy said sums up Disney+'s strategy pretty well lol. So many of their shows feel like non-essential viewing, even for dedicated fans.
"Stopping a fart is TIGHT!" 🤣🤣🤣 So funny hearing all these fan theories about Marrok and he went out like that made it even funnier.
Ooo, a rare ‘got a haircut between takes’ edit!
Canadians are so adorable, not understanding the "if I can't have, nobody can" mentality.
Boring Women in Space a.k.a. Ahsoka on Disney+
Say what you will, but as someone that's been a star wars fan since '97 Ahsoka revitalized my fandom in a way that the sequel trilogy failed at on every level. I even started collecting figures again.
Not good! 😂
more planning in this pitch meeting than Filoni ever did
I’m just going to say what everyone is thinking: the woman who plays Sabine is very sexy even with that haircut, and this show would have been much better had these action protagonists been cast as men instead of women. There, it’s been said.
I'd say this series would have let me down as a SW fan but my love for it died the day i heard George sold it to Disney
Hey so this is where I post my name and social security number right Mr Writer and Producer guys?
That show suuuuuuuucked
Thanks for your channel now I can get the rest of movies without wasting time or money you guys are awesome 👍
I love how the pitchmeeting about an entirely inconsequential series of events also completely forgos Hera's """"""plot arc"""""" because it was even MORE inconsequential to the series of barely-events.
5:40 That scene was so fucking dumb and forced 🤦🏻 Dont do stuff like that Disney, *NOONE* likes this...
Kathleen Kennedy will be remembered as one of the most incompetent leaders in history. Nothing she has produced as head of Lucasfilm has added value to the Star Wars universe. Viewship is down. Toy Sales are down. Engagement is down. The once 4 billion dollar brand is now on life support because of her.
Also, amazing video. I must see what you do next.
Just sums up what utter bollocks this show was.
I think you forgot to mention Hera son I think you forgot that
These Disney shows are such an empty, soulless money grab.  Pure plot contrivances, fan service, and retreading of every trope we've seen a thousand times already.
Content Creator: "Best Beard in the Galaxy"
Where's the white knights and sjws at? 🤣🤣🤣
Will there ever be an Andor Pitch Meeting episode or are genuinely good shows not allowed here?
Thanks for suffering through it for us
I really wish that Disney and Hollywood as a whole would drop the archaic notion that "animation is for kids" they should've finished this story with a "Rebel's Final Season" kinda deal, not live action. Star Wars (specifically Jedi storys) do not belong as live action, animation is the proper medium for space wizzards flipping around with lazer swords. Rogue One was amazing, partially because Vader was used more as a demoic reaper than a character.
Is there a reason there's no Andor Pitch Meeting?
I don't get why do many people don't like all the mandolorian stuff it's the best star wars since the prequal trillagy I get it has floors an shit what doesn't but I've enjoyed every episode so far and hoping the mandolorian and its spin off keep getting made.
Its kind of annoying how much bad guys forget how and when to use guns in this show. Its also frustrating that the writers do not know how the force works. Randomly gets the force and it super good at it, really makes all that jedi training with people who are actually talented look pretty lame in comparison. Apparently anyone can use the force. Which should mean the galaxy is tripping over force users and most of them would be darkside users.
One Piece pitch meeting whenn
Disney continues to ruin Star Wars, one show at a time.
I feel like Huyang is in this show because they watched Pitch Meetings. Most of his existence in the show is pointing out the logical way to do it but the characters keep ignoring him lmao  Huyang: You guys should stay together, you're stronger that way. Ahsoka we have no idea where these whales are going, if they take us somewhere else we would've already lost.   Ahsoka and Sabine: Listening to you is super HARD! Extremely inconvenient!
Thank you for helping me decide not to watch these. I’m sure the pitch meetings are more entertaining anyway
am i the only one that thinks Thrawn looks like Smurf Elon Musk?
God bless you for being one of the voices of reason on youtube. You named nearly criticism I had .
don't forget to cut every lightsaber fight to a scene nobody cares about
Awesome video as always. And Disney Star Wars is woke trash!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
i hate how aggressive she looks while she's fighting makes it look like she's using the dark side. its like the dont even know that emotions are a crucial aspect of the force 😮‍💨
Haha i think prequel kids that don’t understand why a lot of us thought AHSOKA was shite will need to watch this 😂
Asoakedturd
What a tragic waste of the Death Trooper concept.
Sabine did nothing wrong, kinda like Wanda Maximoff in 'WandaVision' and if it were me, I probably would've done the same thing.
here’s to continuity errors 🍻
I’m so glad to have watched this rather than the actual show didn’t miss anything.   By the way, that new producer guy haircut is TIGHT!
"Tibia"! That line caught me off guard and I literally spit food out of my mouth. Thankfully I have a dog to clean up the mess.
So you cut your hair for the Producer Guy? That's commitment!
“She is just immediately that good at using the force?” “Yes.” “Well okay then!” 😁 Perfectly sums up that moment.
"Kill a fart". Made my day, thanks.
Watching a Pitch Meeting instead of watching them defile the corpse of Star Wars is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I laughed too hard at “Stopping a fart is Tight!”  I’m 30 😂😂
Cool, didnt have to watch it 😂
Where is Across the Spider verse pitch?
"I do usually bathe alone."
"Stopping a fart is tight!" Is one of my favorite uses of that joke to date. Well done.
Ahsoka is an example of why you don't go full Filoni.
Boy oh boy am I happy I did not bother to watch even 1 second of this pile of dog poo. It seems to be so dumb even Pitch meeting (although hilarious as always) was a bit annoying. Not because there was anything wrong with the Pitch Meeting but because of stupidity of the source material.
... other galaxy?
The fact you didn't even discuss the arc with Hera and the council really shows how unimportant that was. Same for how they just went and made it so anyone can be a Jedi and use the force with enough practice.
Day 2 of asking for the CW the flash season 1
Yeah you fuckers didn’t watch rebels and it’s obvious 3:44
Ticked by a lightsaber 🤣🤣
Stopping a fart is indeed tight!
Are they spoilers when I'm planning on never watching this Disney Star Wars garbage?
Different haircuts is a cool touch
As a lifelong Star Wars fan who didn't watch the CG cartoons, I still feel like I don't really know or care who these characters are.
the craziest thing is... I thought the nostalgia cameo was Anakin lmao
It just occurred to me. Did they plop Ahsoka and Sabine in another Galaxy to they are out of the way for Palps return and the First Orders rise?   Probably.
After seeing Andor I had high hopes for this show but the plot and acting ended up being a letdown.
Young Luke a couple years into training: struggles and has to focus to Force his lightsaber half sunk in snow four feet away to his hand  Young Sabine: Force pushes 180lb man from falling down back up sixty feet on first ever try
Well, Dave Filoni told the story he wanted to tell.  And it sucks.  I mean it Asuckas.
I just love how passive-aggressive these videos are.
I had no idea what was going on in Ashoka i gave up watching half way
Within 24 hours this video will have more views than the Ahsoka finale. How embarrassing.
I only watch the movies and shows these days to better appreciate pitch meetings 😂
Never given less of a shit about a spoiler warning. Sorry you had to watch the show, Ryan.
your name and social security number
More hyped for pitch meeting about Ahsoka than the show! Mmmm
Note that Ahsoka kind of did know that the purrgil would go to the same place Elsbeth was going, since the purrgil were what brought Thrawn and Ezra to the other galaxy, and the map was a map tracking the migration patterns of the purrgil.
Ever notice that Producer Guy and Writer Guy are never in the same shot? I bet they live far away from each other and film separately.
To be fair, Ahsoka is based off of 7 seasons of The Clone Wars and 4 seasons of Rebels. A lot of the nitpicks are established lore. Like Sabine finally learning the Force is actually after almost 10 years of training under Ahsoka for example.
After quigon jin died the OSHA of space stepped in and said nope no more lightsaber deaths from stabbing so they watered down and reduced the overall meaning and power of the show er sabers
This series is the latest proof that SW fans will eat up everything DF poops out.
She comes back from Oblivion wearing white just like Gandalf
With shows like these, we don’t even need AI to ruin entertainment.
That fact that Sabine gives the map to Baylan and basically dooms the galaxy to war and genocide just to find Ezra, making his sacrifice at the end of Rebels almost completely meaningless... and then doesn't even tell him what she did...  She's supposed to be the good guy, right?
People in the comment section defending sabine surviving with “well Maul survived? Was that also stupid???”   it’s like pointing at two turds and saying they can’t both be shit.
well now im confused, am I supposed to leave my name and social security number in the comments or not?
Ahsoka was so bad i cant even watch the complete pitch
Am I the only one that noticed the strong physical resemblance between Thrawn and Elon Musk?
I want whatever the people who enjoy this show take. Life must be so easy for them to enjoy stuff like this..
Sigh. I could only get to 2:43 before the absurd stupidity of the show wore me out and I bailed. No offense to Ryan.
Just a terrible show, but it was worth it for such a great pitch meeting!!
"All Stormtroopers forget they are holding guns"...classic ❤😁😂
Such an awful series that neither fans of the animated shows or the live actions could enjoy
skipping the series and watching the pitch meeting instead was tight
Different haircuts… well done
"Because she does art or something" lololol f real
Putting it this way, Ashoka really sounds stupid.
Oh no
@Waymo 🤝 @ApteraMotors
Remember when Qui Gon died from a single stab?  Disney doesn't.
The plot sounds so dumb and full of holes, but the pitch meeting is excellent :)
All these shows are nostalgia bait.
Ahsoka the Gray… That was my name. *I* am Ahsoka the White. And I come back to you now - at the turn of the tide.
Hilarious as always!
one, two, three, four, five. that's the same combination as my luggage.
Watched a video like a week before this show came out describing the horror of a lightsaber stab. It literally melts all of the insides it touches. There’s no coming back from that. Funny timing on the video
Confused on why so many people think Sabine is a Mary Sue for using the force.  The whole time the robot, Ashoka, everyone basically said she had no real talent with the force and had been trying for years.  Its not till the end she gets it which the show clearly was building up to. I mean she threw a guy. Its not exactly force lightning.  Her character growth seems fairly standard. Heck, she even loses to a superior oppoent and gets stabbed to show that shes not ready yet.   Doesn't seem very Mary Sue of her.   A lot of arguments seem to center around her low midichlorian count and how she shouldnt be able to use the force cause of that, but maybe thats cause no one ever tried to train someone like her. After all, the jedi temple wouldn't have accepted her, the Sith sure as spit wouldn't have. Its plausible no force sensitive person would want to commit that time to someone with so little connection with no guaranteed pay out.  In many ways, she's like a late maturing kid who gets overlooked by coaches cause they ain't as big or strong yet as the other basketball, soccer, etc players
I really hope we get a pitch meeting for the Creator. That movie is ripe to be skewered.
When the Pitch Meeting is more than 10x better than the real show, you know the show was garbage.
At this point, when it comes to Disney’s cash grab aberrations, I constantly worry he’ll get bored making these videos. So low hangs the fruit.🤦🏾‍♂️
Huge potential that ultimately left me disappointed. Hey, that’s Disney’s Star Wars for you.
When you do Show Pitch Meetings, do you only do new Shows?? I'd love to see some for some older Shows, like Legion, The Gifted, Supernatural and stuffs like that. Would be so cool, so cool, lol.
thanks for these, I can't comprehend people enjoying this show so much, like did we watch the same show? How do you even have fun with this? Pitch meeting way better.
Ryan did the writer guy portion, then got a haircut and did the producer guy portion.
Did you get a haircut between takes?
I wonder if you can ever watch a movie and not be trying to make a Pitch Meeting out of it.
Can we start the writer strike back up again, i want the people who wrote Asoka to bleed.
Writer Ryan should have worn a black cowboy hat. What? Too obvious???  Lol
What
I have no idea what's going on
I want to see Once Upon a Studio Pitch Meeting!
Tibia jokes was humerus
Damn it, I was hoping he wouldn't notice the smirking and stoicism.
witten hard pls mone. But seriously, they should just let an AI write the next series. Can't be any worse than current showrunners.
I clapped because I know Star Wars!
“Stopping a fart is tight.” Accurate.
If you still like star wars you're a moron
Unfortunately this is 100% accurate and would have saved me hours of my life had I just watch it.
This isnt art. Its color by numbers. Zzzz
I like how Ryan makes reference to nostalgia cameo, and doesnt bring up Anakin They had at least 2 jangly keys
Disney Star Wars is just so, SO, bad LOL
1:55 I like that he holds off laughter at Ahsoka fighting spaceships with laser swords
What a trash show. Disney killed Star wars
The fact people actually liked this show is proof society is full of mentally handicapped people
This Pitch Meeting made me glad that I have never watched, nor ever will watch, this dumb show.
Now that i watch a pitch meeting i'll watch the show
I wish they'd use all these space props to make a live action Treasure Planet. First thing I thought of when they pulled out that little sphere puzzle thing.
If it wasn't because "they're protesting about it", I'd say it's a series ChatGPT cooked up if you told it to write me an adventure of a Jedi named Asoka.
That was so cathartic. Thank you!
So lightsabers through the chest are no longer a death blow and stormtroopers are zombies now - yeah, it’s time to put this franchise in the grave…
_Ah, soka..._ Read in japanese means something like "ah, I see...", in case of this movie it has a negative connotation.
I fell asleep during this. The script was so bad I just switched off
Treasure planet map.
a plop.... we just got a new codeword for Disney shows
Scrolling through the comments looking for social security numbers
Beautiful.
Disney+ encapsulated in a single phrase: "content for the sake of content".
2:11 "Ahsoka's gonna manage to kill a fart"💨🤣😂 THAT KILLED ME🪦💀
At this rate watching Cardi B make Star Wars sound effects is more entertaining than the Star wars itself
Disney needs to let star wars die already.
Such a trash show, Disney Star Wars is so dead
Dude this is like the spark notes of heelvsbabyface episode reviews
Her immediately being powerful with the force after not being able to use it at all was my biggest annoyance in this show
Every Pitch Meeting, there is a line that makes me literally laugh out loud. "Oooooh, stopping a fart is tight!" was that line.
Honestly the whole show was just a series of weird/bad story decisions that made no sense. But don't worry about it because it's star wars 😑.
Why does thrawn look like he just did 12 months of kemo
Watching the Pitch Meeting instead of the show is tight
Different haircuts.  Slick.
I think it’s funny that out of all the indulgent nostalgia cameos in this show, the one they focus on the most is C-3PO showing up for like two minutes.
Yup. Star Wars did die in 2012
I can tell George hasn't seen rebels
I can actually hear him holding back laughter while explaining the plot
Terrible show, nothing new from Disney
I used to wish for a KOTOR live action adaptation But you know what, they don't need to bother
Why is no one talking about the COMPLETE NEW GALAXY?!? Tahat the show introduces that big of an element and doesnt do anything with it is a slap in the face
you being offended by Ray Stevenson having the best beard in the galaxy is underrated
@2:12  "Oooh...Stopping a Fart is Tight!"
So good.  One missed opportunity: “that’s the guy from prequel movies” when you first showed Anakin.  Very well done though.  Kinda makes me sad we didn’t get a better show 😢
Stoic women lmfao. How much longer we gonna suffer thru this bs
I seriously almost choked while eating on 'we might as well spend an entire episode on a wardrobe change."
It is a retarded show
I feel like this show has a similar issue to the Book of Boba Fett. That being that the show, itself, doesn't focus enough on the title character.
Acthully they explained earlier that the intergalactic hyperspace route was plotted using the space whales migration path, thats why ahsoka knew it would take her there.
"tickled by a lightsaber" LMFAO!
The show had its moments but damn that map orb McGuffin just felt so lazy. It doesn’t even make sense.
Due for a big plopping 😂
This show was absolute trash. But at least it made for a good pitch meeting
Well, I’m sold on the idea.  But let’s not order an entire season.  Let’s just do an 8 part pilot episode first.
The best beard in the galaxy. Facts
Ooo it's a star wars.
This is pretty much an accurate description of the entire season. Disney has become a company that produces D+ grade movies, they look aesthetically pleasing to the eye but lack any substance in character and story development. I'm so glad my childhood was spent in the 80's. I have two adult children now and my wife and I have a movie night with the kids where we watch old classics of the 80's and 90's. I want my kids to see the difference between good and bad entertainment.  My family watch anime mostly until western entertainment picks up their game.
Haircut change just switched the game up
“Then she manages to kill a fart” had me in stitches 🤣🤣
God modern LA has become such an absolute dumpster fire
Name : Joe Schmo SSN:123456789 Hotel: Trivago
Honestly ... I enjoyed Ahsoka -- but I didn't enjoy the bad CGI/VFX in the final episode.
What bothered me most of all, is that a Jedi and its superior weapon have become barely an inconvenience.  I was so disappointed to see that three Jedi couldn't cut down a bunch of raggedy, slow moving zombie Stormtroopers. It's not like they have anything to deflect a weapon that, oh I don't know, cut through inches thick steel blast doors in the Phantom Menace
This show is even stupider than I thought lol Star Wars really is dead
Comsidering how Ahsoka's content motivating some to still find purpose enough to  willingly exercise subjective judgement of (even if negative), and the satisfaction one feels in doing so. Combined with those who enjoy it directly, accounts for promotion & satifaction all around. Thank You.
Young Ahsoka from the flashback was a way better Ahsoka. Can we get a live action Ahsoka series from Clone Wars? (This comment was intended for that Disney+ employee who combs thru all these comments for ideas, thank you)
RIP, greatest beard in the galaxy
Slower stormtroppers ... LOL
I hope you do a one piece live action pitch meeting
This channel along with Charlie Hopkinson's are my best source for latest SW content that is much better than what is aired by Disney
This was such a good video, I almost dropped my phone in the water while I was doing a Soaka!
I always feel like I binge watched the entire show after these.... and missed absolutely nothing.
Raise your hand if you've literally never heard of this Ahsoka person until just now?  ✋
Ahsoka was very likable in Clone Wars and Rebels. I have no idea what they were thinking with her live action version but you could tell they lost faith in their own writing when they made her show about Sabine instead.
Sounds like the Ahsoka show sucks! I’m so glad that I got rid of Disney+
Mac and me pitch meeting please!!!! I wonder how many times I have commented this now 😂
A fart ... LOL
Sabine goes away with the map which gives the bad guys the chance to steal it then she gives it to them for the chance to meet Ezra dooming the entire galaxy in the process... Sabine is the actual bad guy in this series and nobody can tell me otherwise! And I hate that her fuck ups are not call out by no one there!
RIP Ray Winstone  😢  You’ll be missed
Thanks for making funny videos about shows we shouldn't waste time watching!
Idea 😂 lol
Words of wisdom at the end there!! 😊
Those ticklish lightsabers are the worst! Except the ones that actually kill, I guess...
Disney killed Star Wars
I completely gave up on Disney shortly after Endgame. Always appreciate videos like this that let me know I made the right decision.  Wow did they ruin Star Wars...
Filoni Garbage at its finest 🤌
Hair cut
I am so sorry that you have to watch the entire content of an entire show that was this bad to make a pitch meeting.  I gave up watching after the and episode.  For some reason Disney shows remind me of the episode of the Simpsons where Homer is being tortured  by the devil and forced to eat all,of the donuts in the world.  And Disney is the devil forcing us to watch countless hours of live action Woke remakes of classics Disney shoes, and making us watch star wars characters who are in a nonsensical series
You didn't go hard enough
Thanks for doing this. I completely tuned out after the second episode
thank you for highlighting how pointless the anakin episode was
How did you get this actual footage showing Kathleen Kennedy and Dave Filoni talking about the total not flop, Ahsoka?!
Woah woah woah woah woah...wait a minute...two characters with two different hair styles! You're pushing the budget on these videos!
Thanks for capturing how stupid and boring this series was
Thrown... He's from the books!
Ugliest show
Wouldn't you need my date of birth also?
Like children's YouTube channel story. What a joke!   I am glad I saw pitch meeting. No intention of seeing this shit feast.
was waiting for this, so I don't have to watch this trash show
Who is this tibla lady - classic.
Hi, I have a Name and here is a number 1234567890
Can't wait for Exorcist: Believer!
"...or we slap a nostalgic cameo on the end & call it a day." ROFLOL 😂
Ryan must have wrote this months ago to have his hair grow back so much.
Stopping a fart is tight. Im done
That Zombie realization tho.
Do One Piece live action please 🥺
OMFG, did I ever dodge a bullet not watching that dreck...
Anakin and Luke must feel pretty dumb that they spend large part of their life traning to use the force, its much easier if you can just use it when its convient for the plot.
I don't like this one as much as some of his usual ones. While he did have some accurate criticisms of the show, some of them were only valid if you ignored what was in the show. Such as his comment about Ahsoka not landing right next to the others, having the confrontation with Baylan, and then having to run away from the fight to get to her friends to help. If you watch the episode this is explained by her ship being attacked by fighters and rather than her dropping out of the ship in the flat area where her friends were, which the trailing fighters could have easily seen.  They did it in a hilly area where just for a second they broke the trailing fighter's line of sight thus making her able to drop out, and allowing the ship to draw the fighters away from her friends.
Fun pitch meeting, but Ryan missed one trick, which is pointing out that Sabine's light sword stabbing was barely an inconvenience, but Morgana's light sword stabbing killed her dead on the spot.
Disney: Lets make the Storm Troopers zombies! Me:...Why? They are in armor and even slower.
A 15 minute pitch meeting would be tight!
Was this show created during a writers strike? Or do we not know why tf they are striking with this kinda bullshit being written??
LMFAO
This is like a show generated by stormtroopers shooting at plot points at the firing range, with the best plot points about 300 feet away, which no stormtrooper can hit.
The way you said “whale” made me laugh wayyyy may than it should have
I would have stopped watching the show as soon as the light saber didn’t kill….thankfully, I was smart enough to not watch it in the first place
Great one. Better than boba fett or Mando season 3, but it's for sure no andor
You can tell this show was written by people who play video games instead of reading books.
For the love of God please pick up that fkn phone!!! Lol
Tibia?!? 🤣🤣🤣
Those EYE'S need a bra....
Nailed it, nailed it hard!  I wish you'd hit them with the inexplicable decision to bring the hyperspace ring down to the planet instead of flying the star destroyer up to it and also the atrocious scene with the ship bombarding our fearless trio from only a few hundred meters away with scores of cannons and missing every single time.   YouTubers must absolutely adore modern Disney writing 🤣
Thrawn is in another galaxy? What? Do you know how far away galaxies are? Were talking trillions of light years.
RIP Ray Stevenson, it really was the best beard in the galaxy.
Hi, Ryan. My name is Naot A. Klaverpuhn and my social security number is 4.
The biggest problem with Asohka is that there were no shower scenes.
This is the best disney’s got? So glad this is how I watched this shit series.
You consistently make me laugh with the end card joke
I actually loved the show. I don't get all the negative sentiment.
Man this show was lame. This video on the other hand was not
Damn. If even the Pitch Meeting is boring this show must be terrible. Or does that mean the show is really good?
The continuity of getting a haircut in between filming Producer Guy and Writer Guy is driving me nuts.
Anyone else noticed some similarities between the beard guy in Ahsoka and Ryan?
Better writing here than in the whole stupid show.
This should be put in every reddit/tweet defending this mediocre show.  Ryan never dissapoints.
YOU CANNOT SPOIL THIS—IT'S ALREADY GARBAGE FROM DAY ONE
Woke Disney ruined Star Wars.
You forgot that there was no reason for the star destroyer to stay on the planet while waiting for the hyperspace ring to attach. That infuriates me
Yes, the show is this dumb.
Oh man, and i thought it could be a SW Series i could watch   I‘m a Bit angry at producer gut 😊
Modern content is unwatchable, god.
You film Writer Guy's part, get a hair cut, then film Producer Guy's part? Or is Makeup Guy just that good?
...why is the actress playing Sabine wearing more makeup than Rosario Dawson?
Content just for the sake of content = pretty much most entertainment these day :(
Watching fresh and new pitch meetings is tight!!!!
This show was just, THE WORST.
"Tibia".  Brilliant!!
This show was the final nail in the coffin for Disney and Star Wars
Bryant clay  Ssn: 12  its just 12 im that old i was literally 12th in line i woulda been first if it wasnt for that damn ball and chain Marriam Elizabeth Farthouse the 3rd having to unlace  and then relace her corsett before drinking her special opium tea out of her handcrafted lead tea cup because its literally so tight she is unable to swallow or beathe with both lungs at the same time....but hey i gotta tell ya my credit is so bad your probably gonna wanna give my identity back lol am I right? Also I dont think you want to deal with the nightmare that is named Marriam...i will say she is surprisingly healthy for her age she says its from all her beauty products that contain radioactive materials to make her skin have that nice "glow" 😉
thank you for watching this nonsense for us! :D
If only Writer Guy was wearing a cowboy hat in this episode that would be perfect
How many times now is the Pitch meeting better than the movie they are pitching for?
I wonder why Andor didnt get a pitch meeting. Hmmmmmm
Please, for the love of all things, do a pitch meeting for the new Robyn Hood!
*sigh* The writing of Ahsoka was so horrible.
I really hope the people at Disney (all studios really) take note of this channel. They could walk away with a lesson or two.
SW is dead. Sadly
Ryan did a great job of showing just how nonsensical the plot really was.
Obviously pitch guy and producer guy are identical twin's duh!
Having someone who has only a weak connection to the force is actually an interesting concept. But it shouldn't result in being on the same level as a jedi, instead just being kind of an enhanced human. Like jumping higher than most people would. Enhanced Reactiontime etc.
Gotta be honest, Ashoka sounds like a load of bollocks. It looks even worse. Those fight scenes were worse than Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie - and that's saying something.
I've only ever sat through the first trilogy, but at this point I feel like I'm caught up in the series because of these pitch meetings
Oh really
I still don't understand why there's an ancient map leading to where he went just 10 years prior completely at random.
For real, though: People need to stop overreacting to people in Star Wars surviving lightsaber stabs. As long as it doesn't go through the heart, having a hole through your body isn't nearly as lethal as you'd think, especially if you don't have to worry about blood loss, and it's totally believable that Star Wars medical tech can fix that. Sabine's wound in particular would have resulted in a ruined liver and possibly a damaged lung, neither of which is instantly fatal.
My name is Netflix My social security is Do Da One Piece
was the writer guy part of the writer's strike?😂
Don't mind me slowly coming to terms that Disney burned me out on what was once my favorite fictional character : /
a Pitch Meeting for Unwelcome please
It was really simple, but the 'shin' joke got me.  😆
Wow! I hadn't realized how shockingly bad the writing on this show was
they have different haircuts, which, of course they do, they’re two different people, but usually writer guy and producer guy matches
No "Super easy, barely an inconvenience"?
Another Disney show that got outmatched by a Pitch Meeting.
I can't get over the fact that this series was supposed to be the continuation of rebels made as a good animation series by competent people, but the success of mandalorian made them turn this into another lackluster disney+ live action. and they really flattened this cool complex character everyone loved.
As a fan of star wars rebels, im glad i didn't see this show
perfect description of that stupid plot.
Seeing Ahsoka Force-travelling through space made me glad I gave up Star Wars the second they had Leia do it.
Glorious
Memba when everyone thought Marrok was Ezra?   Lmao good times
So glad I didn't waste time watching any Ashoka or Rebels stuff. XD rather watch these instead.
“She gets inside a whale.” “she gets inside a whale 🐋 “. I don't know why but that killed me lol😂
*Sabine gets stabbed and lives* Qui-Gon Jinn: Ohhhh come on!
Please do a pitch meeting for the 2017 and 2021 My Little Pony movies
Whoa this show has a C3PO CAMEO?!? Wow I missed so much
"A big ploppin'" is a great way to describe Disney's new content.
Why is there a map to a bad guy?
2 things I felt about Ahsoka: 1) She lacked the personality that made the character enjoyable in the Clone Wars, and I don't think that's the rosario dawson's fault. 2) The pacing seemed off, and not in the usual ways. Like every scene felt slow, like I should be watching it in 1.5X speed. Far too many thoughtful pauses and meaningful stares into the distance. It just didn't work for me. Needed more action, more urgency, or more entertainment. I shouldn't feel like I'm sitting and waiting for a conversation to finish. Boring.
"Shin"
“For a death” my new favorite Ryan line
To be fair some of these criticisms make more sense if you've seen rebels all the way through, but if you just come in without having seen rebels?  Yeah...
Do da one piece please
Love these! I finally thought we were going to see Producer Guy just give up though, at times he seemed so down, I would have loved to see this series just be too much stupid for him.
Instructions unclear. My credit score is now 2.
Producer guy definitely upstaged Writer guy in this episode.
I waited sooo long for thiss
Wow producer guy really didn't get any time in this one to voice how serious the problems were
Love not having to watch this show. Smile.
How do you constantly fail with an IP like this? You have lightsabers and spaceships and you consistently make them boring, a feat once thought to only be possible in the Phantom Menace
“She’s just immediately that good at using the Force?” 😂💀  Well, it seems Disney's logic is: All you need to do to be able to use the Force is just to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, lmao. No training, no the Force sensitivity.... NO. A good affirmation is all you need! 🤣 Apparently, the Force/ Jedi/ Sith are not that special anymore... It's not a big deal to be the Force user at this point 😔
The different hair cuts are screwing up my whole world view
Great work.
DIsney Star Wars...... the new name for pointless rubbish 😁
Ryan really hits my expectation on this pitch meeting better than my expectation and the result I got from watching the actual show. During the show I was like "yeah this part will be on pitch meeting" and it did!
I noticed that there's no Pitch Meeting episode of The Exorcist yet. Is there gonna be one for Exorcist: Believer? Because if so, I'd love to see one for the original as well.
Ok my name and social security number are...     oh wait wat, no I don't want my identity stolen. I only got one of those 😕
This one deserves an award!🤣🤣👏👏...👏
uuunclear
At this point I only watch the pitch meetings of disney shows, or most mainstream shows actually. It's better content, more entertaining to watch and doesn't sacrifice your mental health and money. Also, apparently they forgot that reanimated corpses from the witches are actually really dangerous and not just mindless zombies
I am glad that you are not related to that producer guy😂😂🍻🍻
Another unexplained plot point: What if Baylan and Shin weren't given permission to board the Republic cruiser in episode one? What was their backup plan? Force a landing?
ahsoka has it flaws, but oh boy that whole clone wars episode, and hayden in it made it worth, now i would love to see him in live action clone wars
Got rid of Disney+  Not worth the money and they just raised their prices.  Goodbye woke Disney+
not much of a threat, barely a roadblock
kinda glad i didn't watch this show
I played honestly, and it looks like I went up here. Sad, but statistically painful.
The series is full off member berries, nonsense logic and plot armor and still the normee loves it, this is why we don't get a real good star wars show beside season 1 and 2 of Mandalorian (imho).
Wait......the light sabre tickles her and that same light sable slices a wing off of a fighter.....................what?
This was less of a pitch meeting and more of a summary. Way too accurate 😂
@1:53 he cut away so we couldn't see that he didn't have a straight face but his voice still cracked. I don't know if I could have described that plot with a straight face either.

Pitch Meeting is the South Park of YouTube
You should have done this from a green screen hot tub
Pretty much every disney SW is just silly. I say this well aware SW is wizards in space.
I do not understand how adults continue to watch this mass-produced hack franchise. Teens and kids watching I understand. SW has always been for kids and teens. TOS was enjoyable for adults, but the main audience has always been ppl too young to drive.
How can one man playing two roles have an impact that is over 9000
Thank you for giving me more reasons to have never invested in Di$ney+.  I feel it was money well saved for anything else. =)
"What if we did Ahsoka?" Doing Ahsoka is Tight! 😏
Missed opportunity for a gandalf the grey/white joke other than that great content as always.
Everything else aside, it looks like they didn't bother to get her any sword fighting training for the role. She's the lead character and it looks like a child flailing wiffle ball bars around
They made a suit that perfectly fits her hair 😢
Still waiting on Dante's Peak and The Day After Tomorrow
"Tibia lady" had me laughing a lot harder than it probably should have.  It's the simple things.
So it seems like I did not miss much when I got bored of the series. Shame as it really started out strong in the first two episodes imo. Oh well move onto the next show I suppose.
Disney starwars finds new and improved ways of disappointing me.   Pitch meeting is the cure tho 😂
"Tickled by a lightsaber." Disney has upgraded the plot armor to new levels.
Ok, so I'm a fool. I didn't realize there were more episodes so at 4:46 it's all spoilers for me. I'll be back.
Disney shows are getting more and more stupid
Ashoka was just awful. So bad that it's frustrating to see it has any fans. This was the last straw for me and Disney+. After this and the garbage that was Secret Invasion, plus their PRICE INCREASE (!!!), I figured it was high time to cut ties.
Was waiting for this. 😊 They certainly made it easy for you. 😂
Asoka was a wonderful installment very well done much more graphic than your usual Star Wars content and I am very excited for the next season
Ohhhh, you said DON'T do that. Whoops
Getting stabbed by a lightsaber, just a flesh wound.
Ooh, nostalgia cameos are tight!
They stole the Omega Hedron from Supergirl! 😂😂
Thank goodness all new movies & tv shows are terrible so we keep getting such fantastic pitch meetings! I honestly enjoy these more than most stuff on tv…
"Did you get a haircut?" "HeyShutUp so anyway..."
"Who is this tibia person?" LMAO
Love it!!
He said the thing
This was absolutely perfect!
Love the ships flying within lightsaber range for no reason
"Whats a social security number?" I just totally voiced that in producer guy's voice in my head
Just Mando being there would have made the series 100x better.
The Show was such a disappointment.
Ahsoka was soo trash. This pitch meeting was literally 1000× more entertaining than ahsoka.
You forgot the part where its maybe 4 episodes worth of content that has painfully stretched into 8 episodes, so every episode is filled with them doing long over drawn tasks that are boring as hell to watch.
Grand Admiral Thrawn - aka Glactic Empire Smurf
I've been waiting for this one 😂
Only scratched the surface with how bad this show is but I get it, don't want to make an hour long pitch meeting. :)
Why make Sabine a force user? She's a great Mandalorian and fun character. BTW, EZRA'S A FORCE USER!!!!!! This series sounds kinda pointless. This ending discredits Rebels and the Clone wars.
Do Jeff Dunham :)
Day 12 of asking Ryan to make an atsv pitch meeting.
That massive explosion had no logic at all.
Ashame none of them is wearing a cowboy hat for accuracy.
The Random Wars, a universe where things happen just because : T
why is it that these videos pointing out the absurdities of what disney is putting out are far more entertaining than anything that disney actually puts out?
They Gandalfed her??
Then Ezra gets arrested for battery and assault of a min-- Sorry wrong Ezra. Carry on.
Thanks, I ALMOST made it thru the 3rd episode, and didn't really care how it ended.
I think the big miss on this one is not addressing how many plot and character beats expected you to have watched a children's cartoon 15 years ago. On another note, I bet it's weird seeing all the woman-hating incels in the comments thinking you're one of them because you noticed that a Star Wars show was bad.
I like this video lol.  Honestly the show should’ve been done differently.  With its current potential, they could’ve won! But Sabine was not necessary as a character. Ezra and Ahsoka and the other force users need more justice. We need more force using bad ass action sequences.  Lightsaber fights were ok tbh. Mostly good but not perf. And the finale was ass… and I actually liked the show.  Mostly because it was a breath of fresh air with certain elements that carry on the Star Wars legacy but it almost feels like they took the step in the wrong direction. Right elements wrong direction… and ik they setting up for season 2 but I don’t want Disney to make anymore Star Wars tbh with you
Man I actually enjoyed the show, but my god there was a lot of issues with it, as pointed out
"So, you have another poorly written Disney production chock full of identity politics and check box characters which will be universally hated?"
1:35 he's stuck in a whatnow?
Somebody needs to tell Cosmonaut Sibine was in fact force sensitive
Ahsoka landing next to Baylon rather than passing over him because she was in a hurry. Seems so much like a video game progressive action.😏 Maybe she's playing a video game in her head through all this.
i am disappointed by what thrawn looks like. having read the books and played some of the games he shows up in, i had a more "mad men" appearance in mind for thrawn, not "blue Odo"
This all could have been avoided if the imperial troops had blasted that escape pod.
I assume it’s because of streaming analytics but it’s such a bummer to see potentially good ideas get dragged out into seasons of tv when a 90 minute movie would suffice.
Wow this show is a dumpster fire. Glad I did not watch Ashoka.
I literally laughed out load more than a dozen times. Perfecto bud, perfecto!
Stupefyingly boring people do almost nothing very very slowly. Star Wars!
Ryan's Pitch Meeting is more entertaining than the subject of the meeting. Again...and again, and again...
Anyone else is at a point in which you only watch the new Disney stuff to later be able to watch the pitch meeting and get all the references?
Weird that he doesn't call the blue guy "Space Elon Musk".
Wait they put thrawn in a different galaxy? But half the existing galaxy is unexplored, why not just put him in there instead of bringing in an entire second galaxy and all the worldbuilding problems that come with that?
The only good thing to come from anything Star Wars related are pitch meetings!
Was Ahsoka's exclamation that 'I don't have time for this' said in the same way as "I could have had a Vee-Eight!"  With a little forehead slap?
The plot was paper thin, but I think my biggest issue is just how devoid of fun it was. Honestly, it felt like a chore watching Ashoka sometimes.
Thank you for your sacrifice. Continuing to watch Disney garbage so that we can laugh at it from a safe distance. I salute you. o7
Getting tickled by a Light Saber is tight.sometimes I make content in the toilet, it doesn't mean uts good, kind of light Disney's content.
I just realized he hasn't made a pitch meeting for Andor. Probably because that show was actually good.
lol that ending, “ we could leave it as is ORR..”
Tis the season! Do Rocky Horror, please. ❤
Girl power!!
Anybody else think Thron was Elon Musk
I feel that star wars needs to take a long hiatus. Disney keeps pumping out content and nothing really sticks. They should put the brakes on and really think before going again. Is the God awful….no. But it should be better.
I was floored when I discovered that Disney+ shows don’t even have pilots for them to assess to see if they should move forward or change anything. They don’t have show runners either. They just quickly hired a bunch of directors and told them to “do their best.”
I actually liked Ashoka... now I dont :D:D :D
Funniest thumbnail.
FINALLY 😂
It is a CRIME that no one is talking about how they literally just pulled the map STRAIGHT out of Treasure Planet.
.....Naught....Much...!?
I enjoyed Ahsoka as a whole, but I do enjoy the fun you poked at it. There were plot holes and things that did not make sense (like the droid assassins punching a robot in the head and the things you mentioned here) but altogether it told a good story (especially if you watched Rebels) with cliff hangers galore for what Thrawn, Baylan and everyone else are gonna do now.
At this point the Star Wars motto might as well be “content for the sake of content”
Jedi powers and the best beard in the galaxy indeed. =') R.I.P. good sir.
Ahsoka. Was a show where things happen. Nothing conclusive, just things happening. You might enjoy this, if you are stupid.
How can you say "not good" and make me bust out laughing
Ah yes the magic ball that will lead to treasure planet
Savage shred.
Is it just me or does that YouTube teaser photo look like an Ahsoka spider?
Thank you for watching this garbage so I don't have to.
You need to do the Ninja Turtle movies.....ALL 7 OF THEM!!!!!!
“It’s going to be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.”
Ahsoka should have died a long time ago. Dave Filoni’s obsession plus Disney’s mismanagement led to the inevitable conclusion that the series was going to be awful.
still waiting for a primer pitch meeting, make it so (sorry, wrong franchise),
Failed to live up to the awesome pitch. #ahsucka
SW Twitter: THIS IS PEAK STAR WARS! PEAK! PEEEEEEEEEAK!!!111!  I wonder how much critics were paid to say this was a good series. At least we got this Pitch Meeting. Sigh
Thank you Pitch Meeting for sustaining my Star Wars love, because the most recent actual movies and shows have been so stale and absurd I've stopped watching.
SW fans gonna take you apart :D
Baylen was the only interesting character and sadly the actor who played him died.  As a show as a whole Asokha was just a waste of resources.
Thanks to the Drinker and Ryan, I can actually enjoy the fact that terrible shows and movies exist without watching them!
Ah, watching half this series then getting bored and stopping then learning the rest of the silly plot through the Pitch Meeting is tight!
The show Ahsucksa
😂c-3p0
I would tell the people who are writing these space battles to read red rising and learn how to write space battles from them but clearly they would think its just capitalist and right wing agenda instead of the brutal book series about future war that it foretells while diving into the psyche of rage and anger
This series is so uninspired that I can feel the lack of energy and enthusiasm in its Pitch Meeting. How...how very sad!
Getting stabbed with a lightsaber is and shoupd always be FATAL. it's cauterizing the wound simultaneously... Meaning you would have a permanent hole within you and permanent damage to organs it impales... Who writes this shit?
It baffles me that the entire squad of stormtroopers had two and a half Jedi cornered, and they just left. Like, Thrawn is supposed to be a tactical genius, and he just let them live to come back and bother him later???
“If we did Ahsoka” Not when she’s that old.
Thank God I didn't watch this crap, the sheer amount of stupidity is beyond everything
"Whose this tibia person" is hands down one of the best jokes ever made in a pitch meeting.
Dave Finolni is possibly the worst writer in the world currently.  I've seen fan films with more coherence than the shit he's been putting out since George said fuck it.
The problem was the dialogue and the stupidity required by the characters to drive the plot forward
Yeah… Ahsoka was terrible…  That‘s why I call it ASSoka.
Remember that this series was written by people who were paid more than $9,500 a week.  And now they are being paid more than $11,000 per week after the strikes!  Totally earned it.
"She's just immediately THAT good at using the Force?" "Well she is a woman and we work for Kathleen Kennedy now." "Right, that makes sense."
Pitch meetings are usually really funny, but this Ahsoka show can't possibly exist
Pitch meetings are so on target, unlike stormtroopers.
Pitch Meeting: Cloverfield 1 please
War and genocide on a galaxy, why does that sound very familiar right now? 🇵🇸
Another stinkeroo(Tm).
Didn't Sabine (a mandolorian) has jet pack, so why didn't she just fly along with Ezra to the ship?
Thanks for everything you have done. Many good laughs. 🫶
I’m sure this show made more sense if you watched seventy hours of a bad-looking cartoon beforehand or read all the novelizations of the prequel trilogy or played KOTOR on impossible difficulty to get the hidden cutscene or something.
tickled by a lightsaber 🤣 you are just too good with these
Now the only reason I accept new SW from disney is knowing those 2 will make a Pitch meeting on these
It would have been in keeping with Ahsoka if Producer Guy had just spent the whole meeting standing there with folded arms and looking like he was struggling to keep a fart in.
Christ almighty, just think that 13 years ago Yahtzee compared Lucas's writing to vomiting through a pen and look where star wars is now. I almost wish Rouge One and Andor were never made so that entire universe could be written off.
Tibia. 😂
sadly another nothing-burger of a show.
Man, that show was bad
Why does it say "Disney" on the door? Disney didn't make this series.
LOL My wife’s name is Shirlynn, but everyone (except me) calls her Shin.  Now I can’t show her this - she might be offended…. 🤣
LOL My wife’s name is Shirlynn, but everyone (except me) calls her Shin.  Now I can’t show her this - she might be offended…. 🤣
For a show titled Ashoka, it REALLY feels like a Sabine show as performed in a community theater by all the understudies.
Love how the impact and threat of a lightsaber has been so lessened that a common cold can keep someone out of action longer now. And while I hated the idea of mitochlorians, I'm starting to think it's better than you can use the force if you just wish really, really hard
To be fair, Luke was mauled by a wampa, concussed, dragged by one limb through the snow to its lair, probably frostbitten, and nearly died of hypothermia. But a quick dip in the bacta tank got him well enough to pilot a speeder in combat. Sabine's lightsaber wound is relatively clean by comparison.  Regarding Ezra wearing the stormtrooper helmet for dramatic effect, my headcanon is that since Thrawn's materiel is so run-down and jury-rigged, the stolen shuttle couldn't maintain a safe atmospheric pressure. Even if it doesn't provide life support (like a TIE pilot's helmet, if that's still canon) the helmet might have kept his head from haemorrhaging.
wooooooooooooooooooooooooow I just discovered that it is aHSoka not aSHoka
More excited to see this than the actual show haha
What is that ugly Egyptian-snake thing on her head?  Is it her head?!
I loved Ahsoka. But I also loved this haha
It's amazing how each SW show on Disney+ is worse than the last, save Andor, which naturally is the worst performing one.
As someone who didn't watch rebels, I have absolutely no idea what the hell was happening
I would have loved to see him describe the plot but have treasure  planet scenes on screen. Map in a ball, etc.
I feel you were rather charitable regarding what i'll loosely describe as "logic" in this show...
You missed the plot line of Hera exposing the corruption in the New Republic.  Her's and Leia's corruption....
"slower storm troopers that are worse at fighting"
Your finest work.
SOOOOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!!!!
Perfectly sums up what crap that show was ...
Ah thank you for pointing out even more of the Star Wars stupidity that Disney throws out! <3
Ahsoka doesn't act the way Ahsoka would act, Ahsoka acts the way a smug Hollywood actress would act if she were getting paid millions of dollars to do next to nothing.
who asked for this show? she was cool in the CGI Clone Wars but id rather have a show starring RA7 and R5D4 with no Jedi
Where was Sabine’s jet pack? She could have just flew onto the star destroyer.
Sabine and TomHolland Spider-Man are the exact same person
I'd ask why you haven't done an Andor pitch meeting yet, but I then remember that it's too fcking good to make fun of.
Star wars is just a joke now.
💀💀💀
"Perfect plopping." The Disney studio motto for... well, for me, longer than I want to say in a comments section.
In Rebels, Thrawn gets whisked away by space whales. When does he exactly leave a map to where he's going???😂😂😂😂
The jumping thing on the outside of the ship and cutting up the fighters was the stupidest looking shot I've ever seen in Star Wars. Holy shit.
This is the star wars show that was made to explain the line, "Super Easy Barely An Inconvenience"
Tickled by a lightsaber lol
*waves hand* you will not find social security numbers here, you want to move along peacefully
Still waiting on Andor Pitch Meeting
Sabine might be Rey
The most absurd thing of it all is assuming Disney still even has writers making this slop
This pitch meeting wreaks of the typical Screen Rant "We have no media literacy in any of our employees."
Not just tickled by a lightsaber.. tickled through the heart by a lightsaber!!
I was planning to watch the Ahsoka show simply because I love Rebels so much but after this video, I think I'm gonna pass.
They did Thrawn so incredibly dirty in this show. Not even close to a good representation.
Star Wars resurrections are getting out of hand: Palpatine, Darth Maul, Thrawn, ... 😂
I seriously question the intelligence of anyone who likes modern Star Wars.
"Best beard in the galaxy." 😂 Yes!
I remember when Ahsoka was barely legal in most systems.
I watched first episode on D+ and then didn't watch any. I wanted Disney to see the statistic that it was such a turd that people who even watched pilot went away.
Why does star wars have no idea how ships fly in space?    They don't have to keep moving forward like a plane on earth they can just sit in one spot and shoot.
5:25 she's a short-haired woman in a Kathleen Kennedy Star Wars project,  ofcourse she's instantly that good XD
2:13 ohhh stopping a fart is TIGHT
"not good!!" 😂😂😂 oh my god ive rewatched that moment so many times...so good!!!
No one can kill a fart no matter how powerful you are within the force, you cannot kill a fart fart fart. The essence of life farts are the force don’t affect the farts🎉🎉🎉 The dark farts will take that revenge . After the burritos , the nachos the cream to potato you will suffer the farts . Of the dark arts
Like Starscream, I failed... But how... mind blowing up. Your, hair is... different... I'm going to have to re-watch all the other videos to see if I failed to notice before. Great video btw!!
Writer "so then our orange and white hero learns to speak whale and hitches a ride inside the whale to travel the vast distance to the person they're looking for..... oh wait hang on I somehow pasted a section of the Finding Nemo script in there by accident - whoops!"  Producer "whoopsie! So are you going to write something different now?"  Writer "no I think I'll keep it"
Not really a plot, just a series of things that happen.
Disney’s handling of Star Wars is akin to strip mining and fracking; quantity over quality and political agendas over fun.
It must have been painful to watch this show.
Friend of mine only refers to her as "ass-hooka" and thinks it's the funniest joke in the world
2:19 Producer Guy: "For a swim?"  Writer Guy: "For a death." 😂
Spot on mate. loved it, but you should have added the part where they get totally shot at with the spaceship and survived
A show that gets worse the more that you think about it
I was never going to watch it. But fuuuuck, is it really that bad/stupid? My god!
Do one piece!!!
"She's healthy as an Ox a day after being tickled by a lightsaber!"  Qui Gon Jin:💀
really disappointed in this show because ahsoka is my favorite star wars character ever only for her and her series to be so… unremarkable
Getting a haircut before filming Producer Guy's lines is tight!
F U OU TUBE FOR BLOCKING ADBLOCK
Being stoic and smirky is tight!
Stopping a fart is TIGHT
Please do pitches for the ‘Star Wars’ Ewok spinoff movies.
This was a great review! Much better than the show it's reviewing 😁
Cthuwhale
Can shit be really be spoiled....
On point as usual.
lol, I gave up after the first two episodes... This pitch meeting confirms it was the right thing to do... Holy f*** how ridiculously braindead the plot/writing is
Disney has turned Star Wars into the version of Halloween where all you get is fruit and vegetables instead of candy. Basically stuff no body wants.
What about the Hyperspace Disturbance at the Edge of the Galaxy? Is that just...ignored now?
This is hilarious well done I haven't laughed so much in a long time, thanks.
Love Pitch Meeting. Hated Ahsoka
I hope Disney keeps pumping out shit just to fuel this channel.
5:28 I mean she is a woman, so becoming a master of the force would take almost no time at all.
My mild curiosity about where the show went after I stopped watching halfway through episode 2 has been answered. Glad I stopped watching. What a horrible show!
Kinda shocked Writer Guy didn't mention how viewers who haven't seen CW or Rebels would be completely lost or disinterest in the characters here.
I’m glad wasn’t the only one who thought Ahsoka killed a fart.
The creators of these series would benefit greatly by first releasing their sagas to Ryan George and letting him do a Pitch Meeting about them. THEN they could go back and remove all of the ridiculous crap that they put into them and maybe they'd actually turn out product that makes sense and is entertaining!
When does this take place in the Star Wars timeline?  I'm trying to figure out how there is a ghost of Anakin
Writer and Producer guys are the reason Im a better person. Let me reason with you, the time I save with his (unintentional) summaries I get to study, exercise, sleep. Thank you dudes! 🥹
Having different hair cuts is tight!
I can't believe Ryan forgot about Anakin in this series. Lol. What a miss!
what's all that mess, pile of garbage
So a weapon that can cut a space ship in half with one cut ALSO cannot kill a single person when it impales them? Why does anyone bother impaling? The first thing they should teach in light saber school is it takes no more effort to slice through a person skull to butthole than to impale them (see how easily it slices through a spaceship) but I would think being sliced in half vertically would be much harder to come back from than impalement.
One Piece when? It doesnt have to be funny. Just list why you liked it. Lolol
Love Ryan nearly breaking talking about Ahsoka fighting outside the ship. 😂
Well done to everyone who bothered to watch the actual show. All I need is pitch meeting and the critical drinker.
Blows my mind that people defend this show.
"We're gonna bring in Grand Admiral Thrawn!"  "Wow,he's a beloved villain from both the extended universe and the new canon! So we're gonna have a full season showing his tactical brilliance?"  "No, I was thinking that we just have him show up in the last few episodes instead."   "Since we do the young digital masking, why don't we just try to make "Heir to the Empire"? We set up the cloning facility from that trilogy in "the Bad Batch"as well."  "I'm gonna need you to get ALL THE WAY off my back about this!"  "Fair enough!"
Honestly how to do Star wars fans keep up with all these crazy names and places. And then there are more new ones introduced every day
That tibia Shin joke is so goddamn funny 😆Ryan George is out here with some of the best humor on the platform
Thank you for this, it spared me having to watch Filoni's horse shit to know what happens.
Not so twisty twist, Sabine is the bad guy.
"Stopping a fart is tight!" I see what you did there you clever bastard.
So this is what it’s come to. Space whales and space witches.
Those shows are getting so dumb they should have a trigger warning.
Can you do a pitch meeting on The Creator?
"and the best beard in the galaxy." "what?"
Please consider doing The Shining pitch meeting
I love the little laugh when he says she gets out of the shop and fights the bad guys.
Ahsoka is a stupid show for simpletons.
Disney and everything it touches dies...  do One Piece!
So you can get impaled by a lightsaber and not die now? What?
The force is definitely female.
that outro killed me :D
Over 18K likes have posted their Social Security numbers.
it's like the crazy people got let out the asylum and took over Hollywood.  just mindlessly making content that nobody watches.
Lower leg bone puns are TIGHT.
Almost half the video was just bashing the finale. To be fair, it was deserved, that episode was nonsense.
"Stopping a fart is TIGHT!" It sure is 😂
This show was really stupid and filled with plot contrivances.
I may be late here, but def loving the new "whu--?"
Let’s be very clear: getting stabbed anywhere in the torso by a lightsaber means death. You will have a hole in you at least the size of the diameter of the lightsaber (which is considerable), so that means entire internal organs being obliterated. In addition, it will make a large amount of the surrounding area of the wound instantly boil, so basically it’s cooking a large chunk of your insides. You’re just not coming back from that, unless your writers are moronic Disney employees.
Since when is Ryan George so mean? What if I want to post my social security number? Can't have shit anymore 😢
I feel like Ryan was watching my channel. The criticisms of this show are universal.
Honestly where does Disney find these writers… just awful stuff
Disney has gone brain dead.
Yup you nailed it again. So apart from some weird AI scenery & lame model ships designs, I'd say that about wrapped up the entire season. I have only one word for this ... Aaaaarrggghhhhh?
I still only like the Mandalorian.. when it's about Din. The other shows are trash to me
I've been leaving my name and social security number under every video I watch on Youtube so far and Ryan finally made me realize it is not a good idea. Thanks!
I've been binging The Clone Wars series before watching Ahsoka, with everything else I've seen plus this vid, i'll just stick with Clone Wars lol.
Truly this show was garbage with terrible plotting and a complete lack of character development. I’m surprised Feloni still has a job at this point. Hard to believe a company with this much money could hire such mediocre talent. And the idiots who just swallow this crap and defend it online are just as bad.
Did Screen Writer guy just laugh in the middle of delivering his well-thought out story?
So I am starting to see why George Lucas didn't want to do a bunch of movies and shows of Star Wars. There is a lot of content not much entertainment. The Storm Troopers are just less and less of a threat. Sounds like just bad writing. Maybe they should write entertainment and less content.
Crushed another one!
Aw, R.I.P. Ray Stevenson 😢
This is literally the first time Screenwriter guy has a different haircut than producer guy.
A pitch meeting that's better than the actual show is tight!
I’ve been looking forward to this
“So you have a new idea for me” “No sir, I don’t. I was thinking we do another Star Wars type thing!”
I like the fact that general what’s her face, bad mom doesn’t even feature. Because nothing would have changed if either she or Ashoka were in the series at all.
Worst Star Wars ever.
Gosh, we sure are lucky that the writers were able to come to a settlement and return to making . . . umm . . . "content" like this.  And even luckier that we didn't step in the "content".
Ashoka was Rebels season 6. Most of what happens in the show kind of relies on you having watches Rebels or at least Clone Wars
0:57 The treassure planet map?
please do one piece
Andor's reign continues. What a load of shite this show was. Someone should have shot Sabine in the face. And of course Disney will contrive some absurd happenstance in a future movie/show where Ezra saves the galaxy to justify Sabine's awful move retroactively. Our bad writing isn't actually bad because it's the Force telling people to be idiots, not us! And look it magically all works out, wow!

Who was that fart anyway?
Having a Pitch Meeting and Honest Trailers of the same show (Ahsoka) in the same week is tight. 😸
Did you get a haircut in between filming your two parts this time? Can’t tell for sure 😂
Who needs writers at Disney when AI is writing better and more convincing story’s then the actual human writers
I didn’t watch the show but was super excited to see the pitch meeting.
Snuffing a fart is tight!
Can someone please confirm if sharing my personal identifying information will cause it to be stolen? Will you who's reading this steal it? I doubt it. You seem pretty trust worthy. And I mean if you were gonna steal it anyway, why not steal it before I shared it with everyone else? You could just do it while I haven't shared it, so only you and I could know, amirite? Honestly, for once I think Ryan might be wrong.
May da Schwartz be with you Ryan.
tickled by a lightsaber lol
I didn't even notice she changed clothes
So sadly truth
Note the haircut between doing the Writer Guy and Producer Guy bits. It looks nice. 😊
Please do Silence of the Lambs!
Wow. Glad I havent convinced myself to go watch the show. Now I can fell better about ignoring it.
I just always loves how Ryan can utterly annihilate these horrible Disney Star Wars shows in such a passive aggressive way😂😂😂😂
Ah, I never rented about Ashoka, but this is the time. It was such a disappointment for me. I loved Andor, it was so great, I loved  rebels, it did wonders in its category. But I think Ashoka is a crap and I'm so tired to be a star wars fan
It's weird there's like cult like sw stans that truly believe ahsoka was gonna save star wars because it's headed by Dave. And it turned out to be just as dull as everything else.
Although Ahsoka does some things right on the macro-level, it is terribad when it comes to the micro. The scene construction, the character work an espicially the dialogue were so embarrasing, I had to pause every two or three minutes to just enjoy the absence of the noise that this series is. In my opinion, although I despise them, it is worse than the sequels.   As a huge fan of Ahsoka Tano, I am more than disappointed. I am shocked.
I'm not going to waste one second of my life on this series. Thank you for the summary!
Ashitshow. 😂
Asoka to Bailin: i have no time for this shi.. Bailin: but YOU came to ME Asoka: hey, shut up
Should have been the Baylon Shin show or the Ezra show. Ahsoka is painfully dull and Sabine is almost as boring.
Great pitch meeting. You should do one for Jennifer's Body. Love that song through the trees.....I think that's the name of it. Ok later
Not even a reference to Clone Wars and Rebels? YouTubers trashing on a Star Wars show without having seen its predecessor is TIGHT!
Now I kind of want to get tickled by a lightsaber.
I don't quite agree with the "content for the sake of content" point. The show clearly serves as setup for Thrawn as the big bad guy for the next couple of years. Also,  SPOILER WARNING  Thrawn's arrival likely heralds a bigger threat on the horizon. Both in legends and canon, Thrawn is faced with an overwhelming enemy, and he intends to unify the galaxy under his command so they stand a chance at all.
The stormtroopers forgetting they had guns part really threw me off when watching it! Like why did NONE of the just shoot them????
This. So, fucking, *hard*
HE'S here. I can sense HIM
I am enjoying the fact that disney cant make a good movie to save their life. Provides alot of free quality humor to farm here on youtube
I'm going to go tickle my wife with my lightsaber!! 😉
Since Mando season 2 every Star Wars show has been a bunch of stupid contrived bullshit.
So what I get from this series is a lot of arm folding
Brilliant as usual!
I feel like you failed to mention the sheer amount of amazing ass on display in this series. Like, anyone who has a halfway decent butt gets to have as much screen time for that butt as they do their face. Hera and Sabine primarily, but Shin and Ahsoka get some time to moon shine as well.
Maybe letting AI write these stories would be better. Certainly couldn’t be worse.
Ryan and George, do you promise to make us a Snow White Pitch Meeting even if Disney comes to its senses and axes the movie?(that entitled girl sure is making her best for that movie to be axed) Also, I second that you should not share your social security number, I have stolen this Pablo's identity and he was way broken than I was before I were him, now I must carry this burden since he stole my true identity to himself, in hindsight, not my brightest move            PS: Even tho ID theft is a serious crime and you should really watch out for it, it was a joke m'kay?
Writer: Something different about you? Producer: What do you mean? Writer: I...uh...your hair... Producer: I could say the same thing about yours. Writer: What? Producer: What?
can't lie, a lot of the stuff he described happening sounded cool. Until you realize none of it makes sense realistically
I can't believe people thought this was a good show
I really liked Ahsoka (except the last episode). I must be weirder than I thought.
Y'all are missing the big picture here: with Ahsoka, Disney has now shown that  they can do an entire series written by an AI and it's not a disaster.
First Name Last Name SSN 12C-34F-78I
I come here to justify not watching any of the garbage being thrown at us
We need a One Peice Pitch Meeting!
Wait this show supposed to be about Ahsola!? Was she that broody girl that didn’t do or say much?
That shin/tibia joke is the funniest thing I've heard in awhile.  Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!
Plot armor will win out over strategy 11/10 times.
Yes. When nothing else seems to be working, use old resources/actors for nostalgia.
How is C-3PO more reason to watch the Ahsoka series than ANAKIN FUCKING SKYWALKER appearing? Anakin and Ahsoka is all the nostalgia we need
This is probably the least funny Pitch Meeting I've seen. Not because Ryan did anything wrong, but because it is depressingly accurate. Disney Star Wars has already descended into self parody so there's not much left to satirise.
Producer Guy nails it when says "It feels like content for the sake of content." And this is new?
Nice touch having different haircuts
TIGHT. How did you resist saying "barely an incovenience" about 8 times?
Oh boy. I am glad i did not watch this mess. Logic lost in space may have been the original title of this thing. Such a great pitch again. Getting harder to not just sum up aaaall this plot holes and dumbster fires staying within a few minutes. Once again, brillant, my brave studio guys!! 👍
Star Wars: family drama on a galactic scale.   Disney Map Wars: Map to Luke,  to a throne room, and to Thrawn.
I was really interested in this show tbh but they just did too much with Ezra/Sabine at the end for me to care. That and Baylan/Shin were so much more interesting and were left in the dust.
Hey, how about pitch meetings for games?
I really wish I was one of the people who likes these Disney Star Wars products. It must be nice having standards that low.
This guy is better at cinema sins than cinema sins is
“So you have a new idea for me?” “Yes sir, I do.”  Starting your pitch meeting with a bald-faced and shameless lie is tight!
As someone who has not watched Ahsoka... thank you, Producer Guy and Writer Guy for cementing the fact that Disney Star Wars production is dying and NO ONE CARES.  In all seriousness, Star Wars has really been going downhill in its content. I know some people say Andor is good... but at this point, I just can't will myself to even be interested.
How did we get here from The Mandalorian Season 1 😭
This is an excellent work amidst other excellent works. Clever wordplay adds the right amount of sarcastic humor that's my type of laughs
Star wars is dead the moment they put that stupid woman as main character it died
Tibia and Shin joke is underrated.
Starship Troopers next please!
I really hope they introduce Car'board in season 2 she has no personality, and she's perfect in everyway.
When will Hollywood learn from Ryan George? 😂
oh and cut the hot girls hair short because... why not
The biggest joke is that nobody watches anything coming from Disney anymore lol
That first joke was so freaking good I knew this would be an awesome pitch
Fighting stormtroopers IS super easy, but kind of an inconvenience.
Such a bad series. I had some hope it was worth the time, but it wasn't. It was a total waste of time.
Best beard in the galaxy. Love it.
It's sad how accurate this video feels.  Is it too much to ask for good writing?  I guess so... they just need to push it out to make a buck.
C-3Po had a cameo in episode 7?!? I need to get disney+! Tomorrow...
I love the show but no lie was told
Content for the sake of content is the new Disney way. These fight scene were atrocious. In one scene you can see thr actor fighting Ashoka waits til she can get up slowly then engages her again lol
Good to know that by not watching the show I was able to avoid the Rey prequel in Sabine.
I dont like that Ahsoka man. His weird lips are creepin me out
So basically, this is just another season of Rebels...another season that completely undoes Ezra's sacrifice.   Also, this must be extremely confusing to people who've never seen Rebels.
Somehow, while watching ahsoka I knew Ryan would say barley an inconvinience after she used the purgals, space whale
Ahsoka should be retitled: How to Destroy Fan Favorite Cartoon Characters You Created Over 15 Years In Eight Weeks.
I like how the first half of the series omly has a few sentences worth of relevant plot
I wouldn’t mind a day off work. Maybe I can get tickled by a lightsaber. Sounds super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This show has loads of holes but I still loved it
Grand Admiral Thrawn is what really got me into the EU back in the day. Why the hell is he in another galaxy? Old EU made it hard if not impossible to get to another galaxy. Space whales?  My god they have destroyed so much. Should have just done the EU books instead of this pick and choose from it.
Ok everyone at disney is on some real good shit cause this type of writing cant be done with w*ed. 😂
She's just immediately that good at using the force? What sort of question is that, of course She is. You never heard of Marysue skywalker???🫢
Thank you. Now I don’t have to watch the other 7 episodes. One was hard enough.
"Kinda feels like just content for the sake of content"  Summary of 90% of Disney+ original content.
Please release the #RyantheWhite and #RyantheGray cut!
I mean it wasn’t bad at all lol not sure why this weird dude hates it lol
Let us not forget Thrawn using the 3 witches to locate Ezra and Sabine ...when he could have done that weeks ago and already killed him.  Strategic mastermind
Ezra? Elsbeth? Sabine? Why are the names so “normal”?
Finding nemo pitch? I can't remember if you've done that one. Im still waiting for snatch.  Also you should do a Pitch Meetings R for more adult movies (in b4 porn, not porn) like Trainspotting or gran Torino.
Coincidentally, this is the exact amount of time I had budgeted to invest into the entire Ahsoka series.
Have you ever gotten so into a show or movie for pitch meetings that you forgot to take notes?
Right on point as ever. Ahsoka was attrociously made
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
as an orthopedic doctor, the shin and tibia joke was gold..
Love how you dudnt address why Sabine was even a jedi apprentice in the first place with zero forve abilities
I will NEVER invest in Disney Star Wars....but, these reviews are great.
My god she looks like such a moron in this shot 4:31
"She gets inside a whale?" gave me "Can I pet that dawg?" vibes!
Pitch meeting actually made this show sound less stupid than it actually was.
Did anything in Ahsoka make any sense?  Hard for me to think of anyone that took a single logical move...
Disney lightsabers having a tickle setting is Tight!👌
Sooooo... The only dudes are the wussy boyfriend being rescued, and the biggest villain. Tell me you're a man-hating lesbian without telling me you're a man-hating lesbian.
Poor Qui Gon.....
My new favourite Producer Guy line is now "W-"
Am I the only one who wants them to rather continue the animation versions, particularly Rebels, since it runs into Ahsoka. I feel like they lost the plot in Ahsoka. I'm still not over Sabine being able to use the force. 💀  This makes me scared for the live action ALTA series.
I'd love if you did a one piece netflix pitch meeting
"You have a new idea for me?"  "No sir I don't. Just star wars with the sanderson sisters and zombies."
I'm rooting for an AI to save us from these shows. Or your average fifth grader.
Do Splice!
Love this, I can find out what happens without having to watch it.
So, your typical Disney+ Star Wars fodder
While I agree with everything else, I do have to say that yes, Ahsoka knows well that the space whales are going to go in the same place as the villains. It's explained multiple times
it had so much potential and was actually good for a few eps...classic disney
bad shows and movies always lead to excellent Pitch Meetings, so there's always that!
I am glad I didn't miss anything important by not watching this show.😂
I like the IKEA themed outfit of Producer Guy
I've never seen anyone cosplay as the Capcom logo before
Start of series: Sabine can't move a coffee cup with force and Huyang droid states she not really gifted with midichlorians to chose her for Jedi training. End of Series: Sabine uses lightsaber to deflect intense blaster fire and flings Ezra a few hundred feet through the air using the force.  So Strong! So Brave!
Watching Pitch Meeting instead of Ahsoka is tight!
Nothing better than women in search of balls.
You forgot this, you forgot that…see that’s the problem nowadays and why we cannot enjoy anything anymore. Everyone’s so critical of the world.
Fantastic Pitch meeting, Ahsoka is a POS show 😆
Ahsoka better have a season 2! I hope. btw I know is comedy but many of the plot holes told here actually weren't.
Ahsoka is what happens when writers strive for wokeness and nothing else. George Lucas is such an AH for letting Kathleen Kennedy take over.
Watching the pitch meeting instead of the actual show is tight!!!
I love how he gets a haircut in between filming screen writer guy and producer guy to make them seem different
Thanks for explaining the unexplainable  Great video 😂😂
I almost typed my social security number because social security numbers are TIGHT but after being alerted at the end of this Pitch meeting I realised not getting my identity stolen is super easy barely an inconvenience
That map is a straight rip off of treasure planet. A much better film.
Should’ve had Writer Guy wearing a cowboy hat this time lol, since this was written by Dave Filoni
Funny but missed a lot of points that were definitely answered in the show itself and previous shows.
Spoilers ahead 😂😂😂 like if anyone watches it 😂
💩🤡 Wars!
These criticisms are totally fair but I absolutely loved the show anyway.
This show deserves more credit, it made feel really good about myself. Ya see, as a fat guy with arthritis, I can STILL move faster and more fluent with a sword than Asoka does. 🤣
Hyperspace whales yahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
This is among your best content. I laughed quite vigorously.
Can't even watch 1 minute of a youtuber mocking this garbage show.
This show was so bad and such a let down
Ahsoka is so trash and if you like this schlock and anything Filoni does you have shit taste.
The show was exactly this stupid.
I did enjoy producer guy's smirk when he was told why Ahsoka brought her apprentice the map.
we need q pitch meeting for rebels, clone wars,tales of the jedi ,and even the bad batch that would be awesome 😂😊
Wow wow wow !
you know how bad a show is by the speed at which Ryan effortlessly flies through bits 🤧
Have you come to destroy me, Obi-Wan?
"Tibia"😂😂
I quite enjoyed the Sabine Wren show. I never watched Rebels so all the characters were new to me. I was surprised by blue Elon Musk though
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT! EPIC DUDE... EPIC. When you're stabbed by a saber you die. BUT NOT THE NEW DISNEY. Disney don't understand star wars or the lore.
I've just realised I'd passively stopped watching this series half way through. It was that utterly boring.
"tickled by a lightsaber" 😂
I knew this series was FAIL from the get go...    I mean an ancient hidden map, in an ancient set of ruins, to show the location of the general who left the galaxy 10 years ago?   Beyond stupid....
Can anyone explain to me (a Brazilian guy) the pun involving the word ASHOKA and bathe alone?
Never seen this, but from the clip looks like someone in wardrobe design really dropped the ball.
"So who's this tibia person?" "Shin" "That's what I said." I see what you did there. 😂
I would love it if every time Writer Guy mentioned a character from Clone Wars or Rebels, Producer Guy would just ask "who?" Since a vast majority of first time watchers won't know who 90% of these characters are
- For a swim? - For a death! - Oh no!   💀I'm dead. Instead of flowers, please send money to the Really Punchable Face Research Initiative.
Ahsoka is a garbage character created by George Lucas for a cash grab.
What a hunk of junk
*crosses arms* *Watches Qui-Gon-Jin roll over is his stabbed once and melted organs grave*
You got a thumbs up for the tibia /Shin joke
Props to Ryan for taking the risk of getting a hair cut in between filming. He was confident he didn't need to rerecord
After hundreds of episodes of Pitch meeting, this is the only one where I feel it didn't not nail it on quite a few things. Unlike others, most of these have good explanation and reasons behind them.
I swear, the show's written in the same way detractors thought the Clone Wars and Rebels series were. There are no meaningful consequences, no intelligence, no maturity, just key-jangling, kid-pandering garbage.
Ahsokas whole mission is to find and stop thrawn from returning, and instead she does the exact opposite. good job Ahsoka!
Extremely stupid and out-of-character decisions being made left and right just to get some cool looking spectacle scenes. Feels like Rian Johnson wrote/directed this series.
Finally Hayden Christensen gets a paycheck for his character! Lets just be happy for the Skyguy in-spite how terrible that show is.
I’m so glad I cancelled Disney+
Making the same Star Wars plot again and again is tight!
Zombies, witches, and space whales in star wars.  This isn't star wars one bit. Dave filoni is garbage
"she's the apprentice of this guy baelin" i guess it's not a nice day for fishin, anyore
In giving Sabine Force powers, Disney is starting to edge close to violating the Syndrome Principle; "When everyone's super... no one will be."
Nobody stays dead in this show. Even the stormtroopers come back
I wanted it to be funny, but this one left me feeling sad!
Wait a minute, that heresy, travesty, blasphemy really existed?
Ryan getting creative w/ the hair I see.
Yikes. Boy am I glad I skipped this show. But let's be real, I got rid of Disney+ a while ago. Couldn't be happier
Look at Ryan, getting a haircut IN BETWEEN shooting each part. Writer Guy and Producer Guy continue to be increasingly real.
This pitch meeting was way better then the show itself.
Love it. Thanks, Ryan!
Honestly, Andor's the only new thing really worth watching in Star Wars at this point.
Crab turtles makes for tasty soup. Also, the most knowledgeable ancient droid of the galaxy, reduced to just ship maintenance 🤣
I'm surprised you never said anything about Marrok literally being the Star Wars Snake Eyes (by the way he looks and basically didn't talk at all besides those one or two words he said)
I’ve been looking forward to this one😂was totally worth the wait
Thank you for saving me time and money. That was just painful to listen to. My suspension of disbelief is absolutely broken by however this stuff gets made. I think most involved are well meaning, but the machine that creates this garbage is just destroying any enjoyment I have for new Star Wars content with gaping plot holes and writing that absolutely doesn't pass any sensibility.
Man, Ashoka was really a dumb, dumb show. wtf happened to Filoni?
Stoping a fart literally is tight. 😂🤣
Another reason not to get Disney+, which I didn't need.
Hayden Christensen was probably bored out of his mind during his fight scenes, he could've fought Ahsoka blindfolded and asleep. Obi-Wan and Darth Vader's Ep III fight scene will never be topped.
lol man, when you break character at the "fights ships with lightsabers" part I lost it. Was that on purpose or was it just the best take after trying and laughing even more in other ones?
This 6 minutes and a half of Pitch Meeting was far more entertaining than the entire Ahsoka series... that Disney show was dull!!!
Day 1 of asking for The Boys Pitch Meeting
There was a real missed opportunity on how Sabine basically has permanent makeup on the entire show.
Do pitch meetings for Peppermint and Equalizer 3. Please and thank you!
Hahahaha unbelievable. 😂😂😂
You know what I’d love ? A Star Wars show that’s actually about the character it’s named after and not some other F’n thing !
two different people, two different hair cuts.   looking pretty suspicious.
I demand a pc monitor upgrade for the background desk! It should be a needlessly curved monitor now 😂
The sheer weary exhaustion from Producer guy at the start of this was poetic.
Cant wait for the Andor Pitch meeting!
This is basically the cliffnotes for EFAP.
I thought the show was pretty good
Plopping content on Disney is tight!
Can you do One Piece Pitch Meeting?
“Who’s this tibia person?”
Instead of “Ashoka”, it should had just been called “Nonsensical Content.”
For a swim? For death. Oh no!
This show sucked. Plain and simple. Disney is going to keep watering down Star Wars until it doesn't mean anything anymore.
Ahsoka was SO bad, this pitch meeting is letting it off really light.  But I guess the channel does want to avoid 30 minute long pitches.  .... I'd still enjoy an extended version. Picking it apart though 🙂
Since you put it that way...yea its a bit silly.
Prefer to see the flash movie again than ahsoka 😊
Clone wars Ahsoka Cute, and well written.  "Ahsoka" Ashoka Bland, ugly, boring.
Ahsoka knew sabine sold the entire galaxy and when they reunite she just smerk. Didn't even ask why. So that Thrawn guy is definitely not a big deal.
I didn't watch Ahsoka (huge TCW fan here) and I was looking forward to this video to give me the run down lol. After watching this, I'm so glad I didn't watch it. I don't know who is in charge at Disney for piss-poor writing, but they should be fired ASAP. Between the sequels, Obi Wan, BOBF and now this load of crap- I have zero interest in any 'modern' SW.
Do DUNE!!!!!!
Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience
epic
Lightsabers going woke is TIGHT!
The Ashoka show is a perfect example of; "Characters are only as smart as the person writing them."
Sabine is so self centered that yeah she made that whole trade.. But it would have been believable if she just cared about him so much that she couldn't help it, and it seeeeemed to imply that. Until she meets him and it's like "lol cool found ya. so anywayyyyy" If she cares about him over the galaxy, she should have broken down in tears of joy and relief and maybe a bit of shame. But nope. Apparently it was only a little friendship and she was too bothered to not have her friend circle revolve around her so she threw away the galaxy for that back.
I literally LoL’d at “who’s this tibia person?” 😂 1:24
Cutting a fart is tight!
3:11 was kindof explained we saw Thrawn and Ezra get taken together by Purgils and we’re told many times in the show they cycle the same routes.
Worst Star Wars show yet. Requires 200 episode of homework and is written horribly. The entire plot is about her being unable to twist a puzzle three times. This was absolutely spot on about Sabine. Fuck this show.
I love the blue bug eyes in the thumbnail ❤
Is this really Star Wars? It seems much more like The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy 😐😐
damn 15k likes in 1 hour
Ahsoka is one of the worst shows ever.
When a movie script is written by ChatGPT.
Hey Ryan I have a question, do you still enjoy the things you watch for Pitch Meetings?
Stopping a fart is tight but it’s gotta be tight enough
Ahsoka is my favorite Star Wars character.  When they announced this show I had high hopes, but I was also afraid it would be awful.  I guess a mostly boring but inoffensive story is an acceptable middle ground.  The action scenes were really good at least.  =/
Okay, be honest did you watch clonewars and rebels 😂?
who could care about this show
Plop
You forgot the part where the guy Vadered and everyone clapped.
Spoilers Ahead: Ye I’m not watching this show, Clone Wars Ahsoka on Saturday morning was awesome.
thank god the androids' self destruct sequence had a long enough countdown for ahsoka to escape.
Watching Ahsoka bored out of my mind when I saw Sabine getting the saber yank I went "Oh boy! Shit just got real..." but then we all know what happened lol.
Look how they massacred my boy(Thrawn).
You should do a pitch meeting about Locke! Pleeeaaasseee!!
This is exactly how this series played out...
They couldve killed him why didnt he already have that off...  yes we all thought this
👍🏾
I feel like this video picked on all the decent things and completely ignore how utterly garbage Sabine is
Qui-gon was stabbed with a lightsaber and died in about a minute, but she's just fine?  Revenge of the Sith should've been the end of it all
you got me at "Tibia?" 😆
Didn't the old man die irl
The only interesting character in this series was baylan. He was also the only one (aside of course from hayden christensen) that looked like he could actually fight.
I finally have a fantastic live action Thrawn, I am very happy. RIP Ray Stevenson, you were amazing
They literally could have done anything else besides stab Sabine right through her torso. Cut off an arm, slash the chest, scar the face literally anything. The lightsaber can cut through literally everything besides beskar  and yet she's out for one day after getting stabbed through a kidney and out the back. I have never seen such a downgrade in lethality from a weapon.
This Serie is so boring that even the pitchmeeting gets unintersting
Yeah I still enjoy the show and think it was pretty good. But I believe it should’ve been animated since there wouldn’t be much limitations in my opinion. While also I hope that the sequel to this is animated that way it has a better chance of being good.
Great start: "So, you have a new idea for me?" -- "Yes, sir, I do. I was thinking it'd be really cool if we did Ahsoka." -- "Well, listen. I'm open to anything, but I do usually bathe alone." 😂
The space whales were how Thrawn and Ezra got to the planet in the first place.
My god that show looks so HORRIBLE! How do they get production money for these crappy projects?
Watching Pitch Meeting instead of Disney Star Wars is Tight
Due for a big ploppin. Why does that describe Disney + too well
I can't find the field to enter my social security number!!!
“Spoilers ahead” no worries. You can’t spoil crap
Reaper has a great analysis of this show, look him up if you want recaps without actually watching it.
Fanboys about Dave Filoni (the perceived savior of Star Wars and master writer/director/producer): LET HIM COOK *what he ends up cooking*: a 2 day old grilled cheese sandwich made using cheeze-whiz and multigrain bread. Overrated as fuck.
(-3    B-)
I have _literally_ *negative* investment in the series--I only popped in to get my fix of the patter and cadence between Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy. Yummy patter, delicious cadence--honestly the entire dialogue could have been in a dead language from another dimension and I would still be satisfied
Ryan never ever misses
Poppies. Best description on any d+ entertainment unit.
Let’s not forget that there was another entire series where Sabine was one of the main characters and it was not once hinted that she was Force-Sensitive whatsoever
Everyone when Marrok turned out to be just a f@rt: 🤡
Let's not forget hera, the general (shouldn't that be admiral by the way?), did openly defy orders, got a couple of her subordinates killed in the process and didn't face any consequences for that.
Adam Driver 555-THAT-WAS-EASY I dont understand social security numbers
It’s a show mostly for those who grew up watching Star Wars Rebels
WHO WRITES THIS STUFF AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT?
I'd love to add "For a swim?" - "For a death?" to my regular vocabulary, but none of my friends watches Pitch meetings :/
Disney's Star Wars: The Tumblr experience.
“Spoilers Ahead” Oh it’s fine, I am absolutely not gonna watch this.
Actually, what she learns from Anakin is that the light side and the dark side are just two sides of the same coin. She learnes to let go of her violent past and stop judging people based on their light saber color.... But ok..
I get that there’s Star Wars fatigue and there’s been some real stinkers of late, but Ahsoka was not one of them. The amount of nitpicking people are doing on this series is just that, nitpicking.
Ethrawn Musk
But but but but just please explain why Thrawn looks so…fucking stupid
he has jedi powers and the best beard in the galaxy. perfect description. rest in peace ray stevenson...
Best line of the episode:  Executive Guy:Who is this Tibia lady who attacks her?  Screenwriter Guy: Shin
The haircut is distracting.
God i hate what disney has done to star wars
I already thought this show was horribly written, but man, you really showed how bad it actually is. Don't even feel the comedic aspect to this one, I think this was the actual pitch.
i feel sorry for ryan for having to watch all that garbage just to make a 5 min pitch meeting
"Best beard in the galaxy." damn, didn't realize, but yeah... absolutely... r.i.p.
Thanks for another banger - I just have to note that the voices in the background track are very distracting for me as an autistic person, so I had to pause and rewind a few times. Otherwise great as always <3
Came here for the names and social security numbers
I just went looking for this pitch meeting two hours ago. Thank you!
Nailed it.
Really Should do Pitch Meeting: Writer Guild Strike
Did AI write Ahsoka? Because this absolutely sounds like it did.
Bold not to mention rebels at all. "How does she know the space whale is going there?" Literally the ending of rebels is they take the space whale migration route and that's why Ezra and thrawn are there. "Why doesn't Ezra take off his helmet sooner?" Fan service for rebels fans because half of rebels is Ezra sneaking around imperial ships disguised as a storm trooper.
Nailed it!
Responsibly and consequences... That's what was missing from the "show" 😕
I have seen some people destroying this show, but somehow this Pitch Meeting makes it looks even worst. It seems so fucking dumb. Disney's biggest problem are the writters for sure 😅
And then Disney wonders why their stock hit a 14 year low of $78
we should get a DHMIS TV series pitch meeting like this comment so ryan can see this
I'm still waiting for the Star Wars/Marvel Pitch when asked if he has a new idea the response is "no, not really".
Stopping a fart actually isn't that tight. Sometimes it's damn near impossible.
Oh you nailed this one
After Ahsoka and Anakin and the clone wars flashbacks, the show really fell off. I didn’t like the pay out of Sabine with force powers. It was more earned than Rey, but still fell short.
You forgot something: Mother of the day, General Syndulla bringing her child with her to a potential battle and get it killed just for him to save the protagonist who is in distress to move the plot forward then.
I really don't get Ahsoka's sudden change into white robes. Mostly because she *already* wore them by the time of rebels when she asked Sabine to go find Ezra with her. The change of clothes isn't very special if we saw it before already.
Yeah that “emotional reunion” was rather off putting.  It did lack a really “glad to see you” feel.
When you run it down in 5 minutes it sounds like things happened in this show!
"Who is this Tibia person?"  One of Ryan's funniest lines in quite a while!
This was just as bad as Obi Wan..wtf is wrong with Disney.
it sad to think that C-3P0 has been in more star wars movies and shows the Luke has by this point.
This show was too stupid and sad thing is fans are too stupid to demand better
Wearing white robes instead of dark ones…man I LOLED!  😅
Disney Star Wars is such a joke. How do people take this stuff seriously? Children's cartoons have more believable plots and stakes.
Can you please do Peaky Blinders!!!
Love these pitch meetings. Also loved Ahsoka, unlike all the other Disney trash they've put out. Filoni >
Ooohhhh, getting a haircut between filming is TIGHT!!!
What a terrible show for a HUGE IP.
Must've been amazing being Ryan watching all of those movies and preparing itself for things like this.  Most of this are better than those showes that he talk about _ just saying.
Producer Guy looks so good in yellow. I don't know how Screenwriter Guy can keep his hands to himself.
In so happy i stopped watching after episode 1... Ahsoka is a shit show
0 originality on this one.
Man, the confidence to film the two characters on opposite sides of a haircut.
The dialogue in this show was the worst I’ve ever seen
Ahsoka literally retcons Original Star Wars in the WORSE way -_-
These shows are all easy targets for satire but if you want to hit the bullseye they're just woke BS. Period! Ur the Best Ryan!!
I'm surprised he didn't mention all the butt memes with hera, shin, and Ahsoka.
Aside from the catchphrases, the "spoilers ahead!" part is also very funny
She has ovaries so of course shes immediately great at using the force that takes the non ovaried people a lifetime of study to use
3rd best beard in the galaxy. #1 is clearly Screenwriter Guy, Producer Guy just edges out Baylon for #2
Hey Disney, if you want your stories to be more broad and follow several characters through an overarching story maybe stop naming your series after individuals within them? Then maybe you might not give off the wrong impression when the Book of Boba Fett has 2 episodes of The Mandalorian in it. Or why The Mandalorian Season 3 is all of a sudden Bo Katan's show. Or how Ahsoka mostly focuses on Sabine, Hera, Thrawn and Ezra.
It sure would be ridiculous to come out of the ship wearing a stormtrooper mask.
This pitch meeting had more emotion and acting than the entire asoka series
Love that line, "all the stormtroopers forget that they're holding guns."  It's my favorite quote in this whole pitch meeting. Does it capture anybody else's fancy?
Disney needs more than Space Jesus to safe Star Wars. It’s a lot like your stormtrooper joke. Disney Star Wars isn’t great to begin with, now let’s revive it and make it even worse than it previously was. Great video Ryan
I came here to drop my name and SSN thank Goodness Ryan talked me out of it
She's just immediately that good at using the Force?  Yes.  Why?  Because GIRL POWER!!!
What on EARTH has happened to Star Wars? This sounds horrendously bad and  just content for fan service. Hard pass from me but loved the Pitch meeting.
I'm a bit disappointed... This show was so dumb but this episode isn't THAT funny to be honest
thank you for saving me from watching this... it was super easy, barely an inconvenience
I was expecting a Rebels reference or a punch
It's 03:22.. I have an extremely important early morning tomorrow. I saw Pitch Meeting notification come up so absolutely just had to load it up. I regret nothing. Blowing off precious sleep before a meeting is tight!
"For a swim?" "For a death." :D I'm dead
Ryan must be sexist and racist because this show was amazing, just the absolute best show ever. He just hates women and minorities
What's with Star Wars and maps and bad writing and teribble dialogue?.
Well, if it's Disney, you can't say "Morally Bankrupt" without "bank."
Based on everything we've seen so far from Disney SW, here's how to fix it. #1 Start over. #2 Fire KK. #3 Put Gareth Edwards, John Favreau and Tony Gilroy in a room together and keep them in there until a screenplay is written for a new trilogy. Problem solved. (Oh, and keep Filoni out of there. He can go back to making cartoons)
Always on point!
That’s the map from treasure planet
Im too tired to even make fun of Disney star wars anymore
Thank you for remaining honest about these! It's what makes the pitch meetings so good!
General goes into hiding pretty recently.....so of course a map leading to him is found in an ancient temple with thousands of years of dirt and dust covering it. That makes sense.....everything else in the show makes just as much sense. Awful show.
You ever think “ehhh it wasn’t that bad” Then you watch a pitch meeting and realise how bad that thing actually was? 😂  Also.. I love this guys outro’s
I can't believe they brought in Elon Musk to play Grand Admiral Thrawn! What a star-studded cast!
In all movies the bad guys with guns always run into punching distance and get smacked up.  Twats
Missed opportunity to do a Blue Elon Musk joke!
When you can travel through time and never discovered Palpatine.
This was way too kind hearted.  What a terrible show this is.
Isn't it weird that Ryan has made a pitch meeting for every live action star wars content except for andor. Is he finding it hard to make fun of it? It's been a year Ryan.
The tibia joke got me
"And then on a nearby planet, Ahsoka is gonna manage to kill a fart."  had me absolutely weak
Stopping a fart is tight
I like how you couldn’t help but laugh explaining Ahsoka taking on spaceships with her lightsaber
SOOO one of the things that all of these shows are Pidgeon holed by is the fact that by Force Awakens you have to have the new Order in a position to take over again. So each of these shows is filled with inept bureaucracy on the part of the good guys. I finally understand what they meant when they said Star Wars and Star Trek switched.
I didn't watch past the first episode of ahsoka and after watching this I'm glad I didn't.
its crazy that stabbing someone in the stomache with a lightsabre, is just a chill thing now, not really worth being concerned about, when obi wan took a wack to the side and disappeared completely.
Not to mention the map for the evil dude was made around 10 years ago and was within a temple thousands of years old 😅
Ashoka was like a show generated by AI. Perfect pitch meeting.
Since light sabers can cut through steel like it's melted butter, they would have to be millions of degrees. If you stab a living organism (mostly filled with water) with that million degree blade, the being would INSTANTLY vapourize into a steam explosion that would take out everything in the room. That is an incredible amount of thermal energy being dumped into a body in a second. There is no surviving a lightsaber stab by either the victim OR the perp.
You made me snort at “killed a fart”! That was so unexpected. Lol
ezra gets no pushy cats in this. Their love is aphlatonic. She kept the fhaking for her random tindering dates.
Was the hardest part of doing this Pitch Meeting deciding how many ridiculous plot points to ignore so it won't be over 20 minutes long, or actually having to watch this garbage intentionally?
This is where the fun begins!
That is a mighty fine beard, yeah.  They must have cut all the parts where she just tried a ton of different whales.
Wow, who knew how vacuous Star Wars had become, oh wait...
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😂
Star Wars has had its identity stolen......by Disney.
yeah, as much a let down as Kenobi. I'm not watching the second season
Thanks for the video :)
This show was so bad that Ray Stevenson was absolutely dying to move on from it...
This is a much better critic of the show's flaws unlike the "anti-woke" narrative I've seen other youtubers push when it's not even present in the show. Unless you wanna call hair color being "woke".
You forgot to add that this was all just a really long lead in to the Thrawn movie David Filloni wants to do.
Ahsoka felt like purely fan service for rabels and clone wars fans, which makes me confused why it was live action. Also it wasn’t very good.
hilarious
It's almost like Disney doesn't care anymore and the people that still lap up this garbage are too stupid to do anything else.
People can make any stupid excuse they want for Disney but being stabbed by a lightsaber means death, the amount of heat around the blade alone instantly melts away anything near it. Absolutely no way she could have survived no matter how quick she got medical same with the idiots that got stabbed and survived in Obi Wan. Mauls excuse of “pure hate” keeping him alive barely passes but it’s still just as dumb don’t care how good of a character he is during Clone Wars.
Rosario Dawson thinks crossing her arms counts as "crossfit".
I'm going to have to watch Ashoka now, as I can't believe it can really be as bad as it obviously is.
`Stormtroopers forget they are carrying guns` Never saw the show but sounds about right for current disney output.
I understand less and less with every Star Wars movie/show. HOW the HELL is this franchise SO popular?!?! I really dont get it, the same old same with every production
This show was just so depressingly awful, pretty much like all Star Wars live action since ROTJ, so eh, nothing ever changes.
I mean, sure. But it's sort of shooting fish in a barrel, isn't it? Ahsoka isn't even trying.
A lot of bad performances and direction... fight scenes were the best part. Shin just stared a lot. LOL
stopping a fart is tight
Big ploppings are TIGHT!
What is with Disney Star Wars and map McGuffins?
So do you do a pitch meeting after you finish the show or a little bit after so u can write the script or do h watch it a couple of times and then do it?? Or do you wait till it’s over then do it
the slow and BORING death of Star Wars.
I can’t believe a show where the main character was neutered of all her personality and sidelined in her own show, ended up being bad. Why did this happen?
Been waiting for the Ahsoka pitch meeting, it did not disappoint.
How did you manage to grow your hair back for every other scene?
All of the bad guys' plans were terrible. They only got away because the heroes were always too busy being smug and disinterested.
Tickled by a lightsaber. 😂🤣
Imagine being a padawan that trained for years to move a fucking rock.  "OH, WHAT THE FUCK!? WE SUCK!"
You're right, that was the best beard in the galaxy.
I'd like to see a Pitch Meeting for Ryan George's face. I mean, what's going on there? The head is entirely too big for the features but it still somehow works! Is he handsome? I'm not sure. Do I want to punch it? Most definitely! Just a Pitch Meeting on what people were thinking when they came up with that face would be super helpful!!! Love you Ryan :)
Did y'all know Bungee Gum possesses the properties of both rubber and gum?
Maybe Disney should build a resort based upon a "Pitch Meeting" theme.
I just realized that they both have different haircuts
"tHe fOrCe Is FeMaLe DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"
this entire show was basically just set up for future threads aimed at die hard fans who watched rebels if you haven't seen the animated shows you will be so lost
I NEVER Noticed she did a Gandalf wardrobe change.
"We need more filler in our filler, stat!" - Dave "Filler" Filoni
Thanks for clearing up the plot of Ahsoka for me.  I literally had no idea where the story was supposed to be going.  And now you have explained it was headed down the toilet…
Please do The Boys sometime. Such a killer series
Wonder when is writer guy takin over producer guy's job after the company blames him
Never saw it...never will either.But will enjoy the pitch meeting.
Love your videos! Please do a pitch meeting for Southland Tales!!! It'll be super easy! Barely an inconvenience. I am going to comment this for as long as you make these, until you make it. I will never give up. This is my forty-sixth attempt.
Don't worry, you didn't spoil anything - you can't spoil total garbage.
My SS# is 8675309
It is Pitch Meeting guy's job to watch these movies and shows, but I still feel bad for him having to watch these movies and shows.
Just when you think Disney Star Wars can't get any worse, they go and make this abominattion  🤣
Nice to have one of these reviews that doesn't dog on them for doing a show about a cartoon character.
Hehe - Tibia . . .
How to watch a Disney production: 1. Watch the official trailer 2. Watch Honest Trailers 3. Watch Pitch Meeting 3. Enjoy the 2-7 hours of life not wasted
The best thing about these videos is I don’t need to watch the actual show
Another show I was hyped to see but waited on feedback for. I'll be waiting on a fan edit that will hopefully streamline the stupidity and make this watchable.
Could we please have "The 13th Warrior"?
Would be glad if  you did 🔥 one piece (netflix)
Wonderful.  I could be having  a bad day, and you always cheer me up.
A masterclass in wasting time...the ahsoka show not the pitch meeting. This video was fire.
Did ryan break character at 1:51 ??! I don't think I have ever seen him break before!
“Not good” seems like an accurate assessment. New catchphrase?
I’ll bet producer guy also has a money clip made out of 1000s bling $
I am not sure how you did it but you made it sound even dumber than I originally thought it was. However thinking back the series pretty much wrote your script.
They should have referred to the main characters as 'Mary Sue 1' and 'Mary Sue 2' as placeholders.
Disney Star Wars  has reached the point of, "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed."
Ahsoka used to be my favorite. No idea why.
Red eyed, blue skinned Elon Musk!
Haters gonna hate
Disney is literally just people who have seen/read at most 5% of the existing material around the properties they're working with saying "Wouldn't it be kinda cool to see [insert silly off-the-wall idea]." and there's nobody there to actually corroborate or criticize feasibility but there are 5 to 20 people there to make sure specific races and genders are adequately made better than others.  Literally.
“Who is this tibia person?”  “Shin.”  “What did I say?”  Underrated joke. 😂😂😂
That is the best beard in the galaxy.
The more Ryan reveals the absurdity in Disney shows, the less I care to ever watch them. This sounds pretty awful.
omg, the hairstyles are different for screenwriter and producer guy!
Wow they didnt even mention the show is basically Star Wars Rebels continuation more than anything. If people havnt seen that Ahsoka is pretty different from Clone Wars, which I feel a lot more people have seen
It's almost as if the series was written and directed by an imbicile with a cowboy hat.
"She spent some time in the World Between Worlds, and now dresses in white clothes instead of dark clothes"  "So...a Gandalf?"  "What? No!"  "....that's a Gandalf"
R.I.P Ray Stevenson 😞
*Plop*
one piece live action
This show will not get a season 2...
I been waiting for this Disney is a trash of jokes
REALLY wish you'd send these fantastic videos to writer's rooms. Though i dare say....they wouldn't get the joke. Very spot on....sad, really;). Always entertaining!
All true, but I enjoyed
I wanted to laugh.....but all i can do was Cringe. :( Can believe they made this show.
4:31 I know it's out of context, but man does this show look dumb as hell
TIBIA
please stop with the background office noise, it's really distracting even if it is authentic
Being tickled by a lightsaber is TIGHT!
As bad as Ahsoka was it was still better than the other spin off's.
Tibia = Shin (Anatomy jokes are tight!)
Ryan got a haircut between Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy and it's all I can focus on.
I wish Ryan would’ve pointed out Baylon’s main character trait in the show: looking at absolutely nothing
I was waiting for this one !
glad to see i didnt miss anything by only watching the first half of the first episode
Didn't see the show just saw clips. Anyone else embarrassed whenever a lightsaber fight starts? Asoka looks like she's never held a weapon in her life
Expected to mention that Shin Hati is the best thing of the series. Or how unlikable Sabine is.
the "yes" at 5:31 was hillarious!
2:27 "She learns is better to live than to die, She didn't already know that? Apparently not." This is GOLD!!
Did I miss the Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience?
Love the pitch meeting as almost always! Great job, sir!  As for the show, for me it was a really mixed bag of emotions. It definitely had its moment and highlights, but character-wise I still can't get rid of the impression of watching a fanfic written by a highschool student😢 Not totally awful though... We'll see if they can stabilise the quality during the next season.
I'd like to take a moment to thank Ryan for his work, because it's so great that he watches all these movies and shows and tells us how ridiculous they are)
Ahsoka was such a let down. Ryan took it easy on the show and it still looks ridiculous when Pitch Meeting'd
Also, Ahsoka is a slow moving person.
RIP to the Best Beard in the Galaxy. 😞
The different haircuts are hurting my eyes....well played
Sure glad i didnt waste my time with more star wars junk. Thanks Disney.
My name is Vigilante McCheese and I live on 69 Lactose Lane
Spoilers for fan fiction
Wow, producer guy is getting old or stressed, his hair near his ears is turning white
Producer guy and scriptwriter guy having different haircuts is conclusive evidence that they are two different people
I love how this pitch meeting skips at least half the events of the show and nothing of value was lost. Well... Little of value remains, true, but that's besides the point
"tickled by a  lightsaber" killed me.
So you got a haircut between filming each side? Real dedication!
Hello I'm the guy from Pitch Meeting. I watch it so you don't have to
Standing around with your arms crossed and a smirk in the face not doing much is TIGHT
You should do a pitch for dune
Thank you, so glad I didn't see this crap. Happy to have a laugh about it at pitch meeting though
Love the dedication to two characters with a new hair cut for Producer Guy. Welllllll done! ;)
Pretty much as dumb as I imagined it being
How can Ryan peg ashoka down to the inch and get it right make it funny and still be right when the fans have been saying the exact same thing and get cancelled and called racist and called whatever because they don't like these changes this is proof that it was a bad show when Ryan can pick fun at it with this the facts then you know it was terrible because it Ryan is never wrong.
If you weren’t so main stream. It would be great to see you on critical drinkers channel.
Getting tickled by lightsabers is tight!
This series was so boring that I fell asleep during the second episode
The reunion between Sabine and Ezra was actually perfectly done if you know anything about their characters. Neither one is the "break down in tears and hug" type of person. More of the "punch on the arm and light insult" type of person. But Sabine's actress actually did an incredible job with that scene. The emotion is evident on her face when she first sees Ezra, but we can actually see her reign it back in. That is some subtle acting there.
Lightsaber through the tummy is basically the Smallpox of the Star Wars universe
Is it weird that Ryan does not have a pitch meeting for Andor yet?
Wheres andor
American History X.
Producer: So who's this Thrawn character? Writer: You see he's an admiral from the old lore beloved by the fanbase for his tactical brilliance. Producer: Sounds good. So does he have any brilliant tactics in the show? Writer: [checks notes] He does send small easily manageable waves of enemies at the heroes. Producer: That doesn't sound so brilliant at all.  Writer: Whoops.  Producer: Whoopsy.
"Shitting out a mediocre Star Wars project 20 times a year and raking in millions is super easy, barely an inconvenience." - Disney probably
Sounds like shit
Yes, Ezra should be the hero. But well.
THIS WAS EPIC
Question, do you need a spoiler alert for the show if nobody is going to watch the show?
So don't do that. 😂
The Shin/Tibia gag was excellent.
2:21 Dave Filoni copied that water mirror world scene from Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel with Saber becoming Saber Alter.
Proud that the last star wars content I saw was the prequels
It's hard to even name a classic franchise of anything that has not been completely ruined (..IDK, Doom? Hm... Yeah); but for SW it's even worse than that!\  It's morbid curiosity to see how low they will get. As long as idiots still consume their trash it's going to keep going and going eh.
Sigh.... this was... accurate.
Hold up, that's the map sphere from Treasure Planet. GIVE ME MORE TREASURE PLANET, DISNEY.
This one is one of the few that the TV show itself was funnier than its pitch meeting. 😂🤣 I don't know how the enemy suddenly becomes incompetent whenever the protagonists need to 😅😆😁
This one is one of the few that the TV show itself was funnier than its pitch meeting. 😂🤣 I don't know how the enemy suddenly becomes incompetent whenever the protagonists need to 😅😆😁
This whole show was a ridiculous waste of time and money.
So. I actually enjoyed most of Ahsoka, but after watching this, yeah, it was kinda dumb, lol.
lol
Ivanna is a hot piece.
Just a reminder that Luke Skywalker wasn't mentioned ONCE in this ENTIRE series despite being integral to Heir To The Empire. I guess he really was a "myth".
As soon as I saw them skip over Ezra’s feelings about his sacrifice being wasted and the non-lethal lightsaber to the gut, then lightsabers can take out a stormtrooper with a mild glancing blow, I knew the pitch meeting would be brutal.
The best part of these Star Wars and Marvel shows is...   ... this comment to be continued in like 2-3 years.
Watching Ahsoka from start to finish was Super hard and very much an inconvenience.  Kinda like having a super hard turd trying to work itself out and you are sitting on the at work toilet in a shared stall bathroom type inconvenience.
Hey now, Sabine totes def helped open the door with the force too.
The Pitch Meeting, Honest Trailer, Drinker’s review, and EFAP of Ahsoka are all more entertaining than the show itself.
Asoka - "Never anything else".  Perfect log line 😄🤣
I am starting to come to the conclusion that Disney only make shows and movies so Pitch Meeting can take the piss out of them.
You can feel this was a 2h movie stretched into a pointless 8h TV show. The amount of wasted time is only equaled by the wasted potential.
This pretty much sums up this dumpster fire of a series perfectly!
It feels like Disney forgot how to tell a story.
@producer-guy definitely has earned to have unites states currency with corky Easter eggs hidden and some not hidden all over 20 $ bills, like producer guy center bill portrait, more references to money and more money things on every bill , some secret fold art. Some upside down producer guy warning of the end of the world hidden art.
Thank god Ryan told me not to leave my name and social security number in the comments.
That Tibia joke took a second but i LOVED it :D
Why didnt the ships shoot the ship
Thank you for not holding back. This show was beautiful garbage. Ashoka and Sabine were competing in a most boring personality competition and if you showed any emotion, you lose.
"I've been looking forward to this."
4:57 Pretty much the face to make when seeing an awesome concept before being ultimate disapointed by how wasted it is.
This show was created for people that lack the ability to think critically. Not a single damn thought running through their heads.
It should be lucasfilm on the door. People like to blame Disney but they are the wallet… the creative garbage is all lucasfilm and the same people who were put in place by Lucas years ago.
I’m glad Ryan warned me to not put my name and social security number in the comments. I was about to do that
You do know that these guys share 99.9956% of the genes. That's why on has good eyesight and the other doesn't.
Dig the different hair styles between the screenwriter guy and producer guy.
Neat
I stopped the video just before the end. To just hear that you want us to put our name and social security number, so here it is :) Real name: John Semsaw SSN: 34536T34909A
God Disney sucks 🤦🏻‍♂️
Super easy barley an inconvenience
Qui Gon Jin Force Ghost:  Sabine's recovery is some bullshit.
The horse died, decomposed and even the bones aren't left. But disney insists on beating it
I have been waiting for this! After all the hate it's gotten for such poor choices creatively
I enjoyed watching Asohka! But now that you mentions all these creative shortcuts, my memory came back and I think I was shutting down my brain everytime it was trying to find "sense"....  Brain: Hey, she's outside her ship in space. Me: Hey Shut up!  Brain: Why aren't lightsaber stabs deadly anymore? Me: Because!  Also my brain for every Baylan Skoll scenes: That is soooo sad.... Me: You're god damn right... RIP Ray
i’ve been waiting weeks for this episode
They forgot to write their main character
"Content for the sake of content" This is exactly the picture this pitch meeting painted 😄
Have we reached the point yet at which the pitch meetings are getting more views than the shows?
Can we all just appreciate Ryan growing his hair back after recording Producer Guys’ lines?!   The production value and commitment to making this world realistic just keeps on growing.
Boo Disney, You Suck!
Not to mention, the Witches 'reanimate' the Stormtroopers into groaning zombies, but the two Death Troopers fighting Ezra and Sabine are already CLEARLY rotting corpses, so either they were already long dead (which no-one was as none of them did the shuffling moaning zombie walk beforehand) or it was another totally nonsensical bit of fluff. Like the whole show.
I like Ashoka but now I kind of want Ashoka to die because she's stuck in limbo of being super important but also always being not that important and kind of a side character.
This pitch is pretty much perfect! Too bad Disney has decided that lightsabers are no longer capable of killing, and that anybody can be a Force user. Or did I misunderstand that? Thanks for the video!
Don’t forget to leave your mothers maiden name too down here.
I am going to believe this is how the actual pitch went at Disney for this.
"So Sabine tries to give Ezra his lightsaber back and he says, heck no, I don't need that, the Force is my ally!" "But don't the Jedi Knights use lightsabers-" "And then Ezra picks up a blaster and shoots a Stormtrooper in the face!" "But didn't Ezra just say-" "Hey, shut up!"
Hi, My name is William Mighty & my SS is 69-R34-420
Let's be fair, the whales were how Thrawn got there in the first place, so it's not much of a stretch.
Tibia 🤣
This guy’s out here making all kinds of quality content!
This is the best thing about Disney Star Wars. Making fun of it
Ryan George Sr V (the fifth) SSN: 555-55-5555 Cell: (555) 555-5555 Height: 5’ 5” (originally) Weight: 55 lbs… lost both legs and an arm in a galactic conflict and was pretty lean before then, thankfully I still have my butt  Favorite number is 7
A show that is a sequel to a show that is a sequel to a different show that is a spin-off of a movies that are a prequel to different trilogy of movies.
Disney´s + show Sabine - what a gem! :) Lol.
The concept of death in Star Wars is in a galaxy far, far away from the writer's room at Disney
Kudos to you. I couldn't get through the first episode of this snoozefest of a show.
Can we get pitch meetings for clone wars and rebels?
Been waiting for this one! 🤓
Milking a franchise just for the sake of milking 😊
Is it me or is Producer guy putting on a bit of weight lately? Script guy is looking trim though.
God damn, nailed.  😂
I love the laugh describing the "fight" against a whole ship
Literally NOBODY in the show brings up the fact that she betrays the ENTIRE galaxy for one guy she "brother-zoned" in Rebels 😩😩😩
They need to boot Kathleen Kennedy and then perhaps, just maybe, the Star wars spin-offs will start actually doing well
Ohhh, not doing the Live Action One Piece Pitch Meeting for another week is TIGHT!
I'm so glad writer guy didn't go on strike, I would've been so sad 😢
With the height of the me too movement, I'm happy that neither the producers guy nor director guy were caught up innit
Ahsoka was not content for the sake of content. It was just a season 5 of Rebels unofficially
I'm disappointed with producer guy. Clearly, "ripping" farts are tighter than "holdind".
5:41 They didn’t kill Ezra because he had an d republic code to enter their area as he flew in. Too simple.
This is why I don't count Disney content as cannon. It implies that Qui Gon was REALLY weak to die to a lightsaber stab
I thought there would be more jokes about how lightsabers got much more dangerous after 1:09
Imagine being a sad little weirdo who liked this show 😂
... I didn't enjoy ahsoka at all
He REALLY does have the BEST beard in the galaxy :P
basically what every disney movie is doing now. Big expensive production, pointless story that clickbaits to more pointless story.
if they had made this an animated sequel to Clone Wars I feel like it'd have not flopped
Can we finally take Star Wars behind the barn and put it out of its misery?
"Due for a big plopping"
Far better than the actual show!
I had really high hopes for Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka but this show was disappointing on *every* level possible :/
I feel like the Writer Guy didn't even write this series and instead just let ChatGPT do its thing, like first draft!
For a swim? --For a death! Oh no!
Watching George suffer for disney's sins instead of me is tight
He missed the chance to make an Elon Musk joke about Thrawn, because they look so alike.

I'm SO glad I didn't watch this show lol
I had to back it up when I thought you said Thron was a smerfy blue guy
sadly this is accurate
Let me get this straight, this is now 3 Disney Star Wars properties that hinge on finding a map? Really? A whole universe of writing possibilities and we have 1/3 of all Disney stories about finding a map in the future.  Disappointed
I can't believe Ryan kept cutting his hair and growing it back out between filming each side. He must've started this pitch before Ahsoka was even announced! A true visionary. 🤯
I also laughed at the space acrobatics, but because they were so badass
What are those floppy things on either side of Ahsoka's head? Are they her ears? Are they her hair wrapped up in bundles? When she's out in space (1:55), we can see they are covered, which means they are part of her head in some way, and not just a fancy hat. Are they lobes out of her head? What the hell are they?
"best beard in the galaxy," absolutely. RIP Ray Stevenson and we shall miss that awesome facial hair.
I dont like it i love it. When i dont love i dont watch 😮
Wasn't it supposed to be hard blocking lasers from a ship, I seem to remember jedi can do it but the force of the deflection knocks their hands back and breaks their guard, ahsoka seems to have no issues.
cant help but notice the glaring lack of ethnic,gender and sexuality diversity... no excuse in this day and age #i'm a dick :-)
"So, you have a new idea for me?" "No, sir, I don't." "What?" "I figured we'd just keep doing old things we've done before, over and over again, just slower, darker, blurrier, and with more women." "Oh. I mean, I guess that could work."  Honestly, _Ahsoka_ sound boring. Such a shame for a character who was so well-liked in _The Clone Wars_ .  Also, why no "that's that character from the other thing!" ?

He talked about how she fights the ships with her lightsabers, but like....how is she not floating off into space?
Our worst enemy;  GaarBadge, has been located ! He's in another Galaxy...................cool, eff him!
Ryan was surprisingly nice to this nonsensical farce
“Oohstopinafartistight!” - Producer Guy
I'm sorry you have to watch these shows, but man I love the laughter
She was just impaled with a light saber, why would that kill her, that’s meaningless
This can’t even be called a show it’s just garbage
Can we just delete Disney already?
God, that show looks horrible.
Further proof of the importance of the writers' strike.
Your tibia/Shin pun was acknowledged and appreciated
I think writer guy should have had a cowboy hat on...
Imagine bringing Hitler back just so you can save your friend, and everyone doesn't even really mention it and thinks you were justified in doing that. You'd be on fcking trial, potential execution for such a crime.
No "super easy"? Well, I quess the whole show was barely an inconvenience.
Forget to mention that the map looks "exactly" like the sphere from Treasure Planet which "coincidentally" is also a map
blue elon musk!  blue elon musk!  blue elon musk!  blue elon musk!  blue elon musk!  blue elon musk!
Underplaying the space whale thing. The pergil sent Thrawn and Ezra away in the first place, so that's entirely consistent they could take Ahsoka there too.  But yeah, Baylon's beard is frankly magnificent.
Well okay then 👌
I liked Ahsoka, but also agree with everything they say? Cognitive dissonance, or am I just a glutton for Star wars?
I ache to see a close-up on the family photo behind producer guy, to confirm they all have Ryan's face
kill a fart 😂😂
Nailed it. I watched all of the episodes, but only with a lot of arm folding and smirking.
Wow, this show seems to be pretty bad...
Lightsaber tickles... dirty girl.
If they didn't acknowledge any of the obvious points then why should we?  Why they even chuckled and laughed at the end as Sabine and Ashoka were not the least bit sad, worried, or gloomy at the villain they had been chasing and trying to prevent returning to the galaxy did just that.  Also for anyone asking... Watching rebels would only make you more angry since Sabine and Ashoka actually had personalities and character traits... Good ones at that.  The live action garbage is just more cookie cutter Disney Princess nonsense with your two latest barbies now having white robes and the other having spray paint armor.  Because apparently being a good artists, fighter, gunner, technician, planner, shooter, and even able to fight with a lightsaber... Was not good enough for Sabine when she had a pre made personality and character that people loved... So they made a discount Rey.  Yes she is a discount Rey and now you know why it stings.
"She's just that good at using the Force?" "Yea, the force doesn't really require training anymore, I decided."
Your name and social security!!
What about the show being a live action continuation of clone wars and rebels but not really focusing on ahsoka (this is coming from someone who loves the show)
In the new thrawn books Thrawn is nothing like he’s portrayed in the show. Though most of his dialogue is internal.
Educated guess: Asoka crosses her arms so much coz she wants to cover her boobas so that fans don't sexualize her character?... This is my assumption based on this new "woke" society we live in nowadays🤔🙄 smh I hate this so much, movies r no longer escapes from reality, it's become propaganda for some fantasy war that's apparently necessary 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮😵
I get all the hate these shows have - people expect John Williams and George Lucas and they ain't here - but I'm just glad none of these seasons have actually been terrible haha.  Solo wasn't bad either; it was just a whipping boy for episode 8.   Here's hoping they completely retcon 7-9 down the road!
“She’s just immediately that good at using the Force?” “YES.” 😂
The bad guy was coming back regardless. Season just showed how it happened
These pitch meetings almost make the pain of Disney Star Wars worth it😊
Isn't the sphere map taken from treasure planet?
Since the whales brought thrawn and Ezra there in the first place, it makes sense that they would go there again
It is a credit to Tony Gilroy that Andor doesn't have a Pitch Meeting.
Do i sense a hint of beard jealousy here ? 😁
Thank you for watching this garbage for us.
It's come to the point that the show is so boring even the pitch meeting is not saving it. It's all so bad and in the same way for years. Not even worth the punch.
Oh thank goodness, now I don't have to watch Ahsoka. There's hardly any reviews about it either, so I guess really no one was watching it
You are awlways hilarious, you always entertain me, but sometimes I am also deeply sad under the laughter.  I wanted to love this show. I *needed* to love this show, a brilliant portrayal of Thrawn could have made the competence and menace of the Andor show a part of more mainstream Star Wars. Thrawn HAD to be perfect for my hope to be restored.  I tried to like the show.  I did not like the show.  For every element or idea that I thought was handled well, there were so many stupid, blundering, or character-destroying elements.  I’m an optimistic person who tries to enjoy things. But it’s finally over. Star Wars Legends, and the RPG’s I’m a part of, are now officially more “real” to me than the braindead fan-fiction Disney is producing. Their failure is complete. I mourn.
This is probably the first time in a long time an honest trailer and a pitch meeting of the same project is released on the same week.
Great as always, would love to see an Andor Pitch Meeting!
01:23-01:26 This is the best joke, I've decided! Or, maybe a pun? Still good, though🤣
How do you pronounce Ahsoka? Ah-suck-ah.
Underrated anatomy joke there 😂
Wow, even with Pitch Meeting acting as an immense buffer, this series plot is so dumb it hurt my brain.
Great critique. I honestly cannot understand how any SW fan thinks Ahsoka was good.
OMG when will they stop raping Star Wars?
😂😂😂 SO good.. no wonder they think Thran is a mastermind .. these Strom troopers are all freaking idiots
Ryan always gets it
1:54 - I'm glad you went with that take.
Andor is tight!
Post-Lucas Star Wars is such utter, unwatchable _garbage_ .  Ryan's lens is the only thing that makes it tolerable.
Your Name 50C147 53CUR1TY
Since when are there two different presenters?
I must have saved dozens, if not hundreds of hours of my life by watching the pitch meeting instead of mindless Disney content
You can criticize all you want, but content for the sake of content is tight.
Can you believe that some people think this show was good?
let's be real here, Sabine and Erza are just MORE than friends.
I can't listen to any more of this. I don't even want to hear the dumb story through my favorite Youtubers Ryan and George.
He didn't steal the ship. Thrawn gave him the ship because reasons.
Truly, the best beard in the galaxy.
SO he liked it :) cool.
If Qui-Gon was stabbed by a Disney lightsaber he'd still be alive
PG: That sounds like it's just content for the sake of content. SWG: Content for the sake of content? Of course not, sir... It's content for the sake of *money.* PG: Oh yeah! Money is tight.
"Content for the sake of content" perfectly describes Disney´s new Star Wars.
Finally a pitch meeting that isn't a compilation nor pitch meeting revisited!
you even forgot anakin vs ashoka part ;P
You know its bad when the pitch guy cant keep a straight face.
These two are obviously different people 1: they are wearing different clothes 2: one’s hair is slightly shorter 3: ye
Nailed it again. I absolutely hated Ahsoka. But the Obi Wan series is still the worst.
I loved Ahsoka, you make even good shows sound ridiculous xD
9y87y8uiy
I can't believe people would actually pay to watch this kind of Hollywood crap.
1:22 ... lmao I had to go back and listen to that one again.  Good one.
I think it's deliberate. Once upon a time, being the IP holder gave absolute power over a franchise. That day is done. If the IP holder insists on not bringing out new content or bringing out garbage content, we can now make our own. I invite all my fellow Star Wars fans to enjoy another unauthorized novel completely free. Just google Legend of the Harp Jedi.
Thank you for calling out Ezra being stupid in the end.
I requested for a       pitch meeting long ago, but Ryan just wouldn't do it!       Is probably the best movie ever made.
So glad I can confidently hit that like button even before seeing any of these great videos!
The dialogue is so bad, Feloni really is paying tribute to George Lucas there. Sabine and Asokas dialogue when they reunite is so stunted it sounds like an old sitcom and they're waiting for the laugh track. What do you say to someone you betrayed and left for dead? "Hey, i thought u were dead... (cue laugh track)" how do you respond to the person who betrayed you that you just tracked down across a galaxy and found "and miss this reunion?....(cue laugh track)" Like, and that's it. That's all they say about it. If he cant be bothered, hire someone to write some dialogue for the characters geez 🙄
Name: Noah. Number: #### ##2#
imma get flame for this but Dave Filoni lost his magic😭
Watching back-to-back Honest Trailer and Pitch Meeting for a show that I'll never watch is TIGHT
1:54 Ahsoka be looking like Sonic the Hedgehog there for a second... very unique costume design disney...
You'll get a proper buzz if you drink everytime: Ahsoka crosses her arms, or someone says Ezra or Thrawns name.
wow, finished this show literally last night and now this comes up! what a treat! also, please! Abraham Lincoln: Vampire hunter! I need the pitch meeting for that movie!
The next logical spin-off is a 5-part, David Attenborough-narrated docuseries on the migration patterns of Space Whales
Everybody who still thinks Ahsoka was good should see this to realize how retarded the whole show really was...
It kinda felt like that episode of Big Bang Theory when Amy told Sheldon that Indiana Jones plays no part in the plot of Raiders of the Lost Ark. In this series Ashoka does so little and the plot goes as planned even with her there trying to stop everyone. She’s a complete failure.
Watching Pitch Meeting rather than Disney sludge is tight!
Am I the only one who feels modern entertainment should at least try to give Ryan a challenge?  At this point, we can all just make the pitch meeting while watching...
Oh wow. That show is out already! I thought it wasnt coming out for another month! Guess it might be time to consider getting D+ for a month to check it out? Nah Ill wait till folks are saying this is Star Wars till i sub for a month to binge all this pointless content. What a waste of the Heir to the Empire novels. Just took chunks out, mixed it badly with Rebels and squatted this out. I may just skip it entirely.
Yeah, that's how stupid it was.
Ashoka..ahhh sh*t
"Sabine gets stabbed by a lightsaber" "Oh my god, does she die" "No she's a main character" "Oh okay"
6:08 NOSTALGIA CAMEOS are TIGHT !
My name is Johnny Hotbody and my social security is 69 just like bill amd teds
Wait, so she literally got out of her ship in the middle of space with no gear and shes just fine? Wtf?
I preferred this to the series in all honesty. At least we still have Andor, that's one good thing.
Wait, did Ryan take the part of the screen writer guy and then have a haircut for the producer 🤔.... Oh oh.... having a different haircut for different characters is TIGHT!!
the guy casting Mary Elisabeth Winstead as Hera: let them eat cake
Might as well mention this, the space whales transported the Chimaera, Thrawn's ship with Thrawn, the ship's compliment and Ezra in it to the planet of Peridia in another galaxy so that's why Ahsoka used the space whales to travel to Peridea.
Anybody else noticed screenwriter guy and producer guy have slightly different haircuts this time?
do you all ever feel weird that these have stopped being funny parody and just gone full real-world accurate?
5:30 "She is immediately that good at using the force?"  "Yes“, she is a woman in star wars #theforceisfemale
Do The Negotiator!!!
Hey Ryan, do you watch other YouTube channels like new Rockstars to go in-depth and appreciate with some of these writers are doing
Stealing identities is tight!
Horrible horrible show.
Do writers even have brains anymore?
I was excited for this show, but the first episode was so bad that I turned it off and never went back.  Thank you, Ryan, for confirming that I made the right decision.
This is why Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy are THE BEST.  Every Female Force user is instantly an expert Jedi in an episode or two.  Meanwhile that weakling Luke Skywalker took three whole movies to develop his Jedi skills and have a whoooole character arc along the way.  Also, every Female character is an expert Jedi and a good guy and every Male character is weak and sleazy and evil.  No misandry there.  Ahsoka fans should be ashamed and embarassed that their hero just stands around with her arms crossed and smirking when she isn't slicing everything in a mile radius with her lightsaber.  In my military training, I was taught that if you have a ranged weapon and your opponent has a melee weapon, don't stand out of range and blast away.  What you do is get in real close and fly by them within lightsaber range.
I haven't watched it yet and its already making me wish it was just a animated continuation of star wars rebels
It would be tight to see a pitch meeting on netflix's one piece
I knew you would tear this show apart lol.
As always, extremely funny, smart, hilarious and wonderful!🎉😂❤
“What” 😂
If not for Baylan and Anakin, this show would be the very definition of bland. I felt like more of a robot than Huyang. But ofc, its worth having a mediocre show if we can get a good Pitch Meeting out of it 😂
Disney Star Wars: where maps lead to people and not places.
"But then, on a nearby planet, Ahsoka is going to manage to kill a fart!"
I thought Thrown was just a meme of Blue Elon Musk & Ronald Mcdonald that people were putting into their pfp for fun, didn't know it was a real charicter.
Ashoka was so stupid. I bet they will make three more of it.
what a shit show SW has become
The problem is that it isn’t an Ahsoka show. It’s a rebels sequel masquerading as an Ahsoka show. This show should have been animated. There is no doubt.
Can you bring attention to the producers expanded job, meaning how do producers actually keep their jobs approving cra- feces like this?
Hey, George, I think my credit card got cloned - I will post the credit card number, expiry date and security code here, if  you could help me out with that.
Pitch Meetings are the only Youtube content I watch at normal speed.
"slower storm troopers that are worse at fighting" finally someone points out how much zombies suck
Oh, turning your balls to open a secret map is tight!
It's been nine pitch meetings and four revisit pitch meetings since Bryan George made an appearance, please bring him back. #BryanGeorge
Idea for next pitch: The noice in the background gets louder and louder and the producer guy will interrupt the screen writer guy, apologize and then "hey" at the office with "can you guys lower your voice a bit, you're not alone here" or something like that.
Are you going to make a Pitch Meeting of the One Piece live action?
Know this is gonna be an instant classic!
this show made me cancel my disney sub.
High pitched * oh no * Needs to be a recurring catchphrase
This show is absolute garbage. Nothing happens.
Can't wait for the One Piece pitch meeting
1:36 : Producer Guy's "NOT GOOD" perfectly summed up this mess.
Perfectly sums up this content plop...
“Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul.”-The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving
Terrible show. It's a shame too because there are some great actors in it, but Disney — as usual — manage to give them nothing worthwhile to say or do. It's infuriating.
Love it.  Keep em coming.
"Stopping a fart is tight"  Yep, that's generally how farts are stopped.
It is an epic beard.
Best review of this crappy show, which I made it through 2 episodes before canceling D+
Thats a lot of plotholes for one show
brothers, i would like thee to know that in South Korea people find it funny how similar Thrawn looks like our president
Might as well called the show "Remember? You remember!"
Great show and a great pitch meeting
😂😂😂… that was funny., thank u….
Usually bathe alone? Usually? So. You're saying there's a chance?
wow...everything related to SW has gone to complete and utter shit. Well, ever since RotJ, it's been crap.
Couldn't help thinking that most ... dang it... yeah, it's all of them... All Disney star wars stories revolve heavily around finding maps. ... Must be a story requirement.
She fell through water, and fire and woke up in a land beyond space and time and woke up as asoka the white
4:31 I haven’t seen the show but wtf is this facial expression 😂😂😂
That's isn't a parody, that's a malicious murder.
Other people think that Disney is ruining Marvel and Lucasfilm but we all know they're in cahoots with Pitch Meeting so that Ryan can have more content to work with.
39170th
Watching the Pitch Meeting without actually watching the show is tight!
24kth
Baylan was the best character in the show. RIP Ray Stevenson.
Day 1157 of asking for a “the boys”/“gen V” pitch meeting. Gen v is a new ask but imma do it. Ryan at least reply saying you can’t do Amazon prime videos or something because at this stage I’m desperate to see your take on “the boys”
This show has confirmed to me that Dave Filoni really is George Lucas’ successor. Because he is also someone who really needs a team of other creatives to help him develop his ideas and rein in his worst impulses.
Disney fucking up their show halfway through the season seems to be super easy for em
Plop. Never was there a more appropriate word.
I didn't watch the Pitch Meetings for Clone Wars and Rebels, so I was absolutely lost watching this and had no emotional connection to any of the characters.
The show was ridiculous. If you can't agree then you're probably ridiculous too.
Wow, even the Pitch Meeting of this series managed to bore me.  Don't worry Ryan, it's not your fault.
Wasn’t going to watch asoaka bc Disney is crap
I mean, Thrawn deserves more credit than just saying he underestimated the Jedi for sending only 2 tie fighters. He's been very well characterised as an elite strategist and it payed off.
Do One Piece live action next
Here’s an idea for a new show: this same concept but instead of the writers and producers you do the crew. So like the key grips and lighting people and set designers and the wardrobe people. And the strange decisions they make are kind of poked fun at in Ryan’s trademark style humor
Lol this one was hilarious!
The undead stormtroopers are so bad compared to the bad stormtroopers, they become a threat again since they‘ll never stop attacking.  Yeah, I‘ll … I‘ll let myself out.
What a nonsensical story this show had, Star Wars is nothing without nostalgia baits lol i cringed so hard seeing that Anakin/Vader scene, it also doesn't help that Rosario Dawson is horrible at fight scenes. These shows offer nothing other than being boring mess with constant pandering.
love me some ryan george
Didn't need the spoiler warning. No one is watching this stuff anymore lol
Good...I was waiting for this one .Ahsoka sure got what was coming to her 😁
I’m kinda bummed that Andor didn’t get its pitch meeting 😢
Content for the sake of content is EXACTLY what it is...such a Godamn disappointment. Why is it so hard for them to make good live action SW shows when the animated ones r so good? Sabine from rebels is somehow more attractive than her live action counter part. THAT should say it all.
2:02 - *_OR why didn't they each fire on the different wings of the ship instead of always both aiming at the one Ahsoka was standing on?_*
can we stop acting like any of the starwars shows/movies have great writing? all the way back to the originals the writing has been more "look at these coold things" then a well thought out plot
What a horrible show, thank you for making fun of it
Too late ... I've already posted my name and SSN in another post .... why didn't you mention not to do that before ... and could you make a Scott pilgrim vs the world pitch meeting any time soon?
If the majority if your script can be summed up as "well that was convenient" and the rest is memberberries you should probably do a second draft...
NAME and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER... LOL
"Stopin a fart is TIGHT". The best "tight" line of Producer Guy
Waiting for Pitch Meeting of Fury.
"She's immediately that good with the force?"  "yeah...."  "This is The force awakens...."  "oh..wow..i wondered why that sounded so familiar!"  "yeah Copy paste baby!!!!"
That smirk pissed me off the whole time. I think that was the point though.
Forget Baylan, Ryan has the best beard in the galaxy. XD
Tibia 😂
1:28 is absolute facts. That beard was fantastic
Actually the pitch meeting went like this: "Here's my idea for the next starwars. *WE DO A INDIANA JONES! THEN ANOTHER INDIANA JONES! THEN ANOTHER ONE! THEN GANDALF THE WHITE.* And you know that bowl of random cliché supernatural stuff? *LETS USE IT ALL AND SEE IF THE FANS LIKE ANY OF IT!* Let's see we'll have zombies, witches, magic animals, ghosts, and limbo. OOF, that's a lot. But we might as well throw in a covid reference...let's make the force as contagious as covid and give it to everyone. COOL now we'll just pad the time with long pauses and done."
"NOT GOOD" 😂.
How come you haven't done Andor?
Absolutely loved Ahsoka. It was such a fun watch that I found myself watching it a few times and reactions. Such a good show.
Lol this guy can make anything sound dumb.
Ahsoka was like Gandalf. Wears white clothes after she comes back to life😂 she's Ahsoka the white
Couldn't wait to see your take since the first episode. Well done!
Plop is the perfect phrase for Disney+ shows. Haha
Tickled by a lightsaber is tight!
Know whats always bugged me about Star Wars?  Why did the Empire never develop bullets to get around the whole light sabers deflecting blaster fire?
Ahsoka “crosses her arms” Tano.
So other people thought it was shit too?  Ok cool
This sounds dreadful. Thank you for your service.
This was the first star wars thing I didn't even consider watching. And it seems I shouldn't be upset
"They sure do sir." Just try saying that. New catchphrase BANGER
"Did I ever tell you about Ahsoka Tanno, Luke?"
"She's just immediately that good at using the force?" Said by every Star Wars fan about every Disney Star Wars product.
I didn't care to watch Ahsoka, but I would definitely watch a series about writer guy and producer guy make fun of it.
“I’ve been looking forward to this.”
5:57  Ashoka called her out
My theorie is they are all droids, that would explain all the bland acting, all the dead faces reaction, would explain the super slow fighting, would also explain why thrawn has a negative IQ intelligence
Never clicked something so fast
I seem to be the only one that really enjoyed this show, kind of makes me sad honestly
RIP Ray Stevenson.  The Jedi Punisher.
Oh wow, what happened to star wars.
As usual, all criticisms are fair.
Here first
If only somebody at Disney had watched this before the series was green lighted they’d have known how dumb, boring and worthless this series was before flushing another few hundred million down the toilet. No wonder their shareholders are on the verge of revolt.
Big ploops are tight.
Actually she ask the whale and i think that ahsoka want to die, like a depressive fallen jedi but i love this show,is flawed but cool as fuck,its like the prequel and rebels,like poetry they rhymes
That tibia shin joke was perfectly executed lol
That shin/tibia joke was tight.
Please tell me someone else thought of disney treasure planet when the map ball showed up. 😅
This is another excellent pitch meeting about another truly crappy show.
High fashion in this one
to be fair the whales were pre existing content xD
This series is so boring I barley made it the 6 min of the pitch meeting.
Saw a video earlier that showed Ahsoka ripped a bunch of stuff from Treasure Planet too. No shame.
I almost choked on my drink from the tibia/shin joke.
Only less than 69 IQ points SW fans left to see this show.
When you start to suspect that Disney already started using AI to write their series.
I personally love how Disney dumps so much money into the highest form of mediocrity ever not envisioned...
This is by far the best one!!! I was laughing throughout
Haven’t been able to get the family all together at same time to sit down for the final episode… so I’ve been avoiding CinamaSins and Honest Trailers… but I can’t skip an episode of Pitch Meetings.
I suggest Apple TV's truly stupid and terrible show Invasion.
Star Wars using maps as the main driving point of their movies and shows need to stop. Now.
I like how writer guy chuckled pitching Ashoka fighting outside a spaceship with lightsabers 😂
I love how you completely left out Hera's role in all this considering how meaningless it was to the entire plot
This was better than the show lmao
As yes another pitch meeting of toys and merch advertisment... this isn't storytelling anymore... is just soulless cool looking toys...
making it so anyone can be a jedi has ruined star wars nobodys special anymore
Obi Wan Kenobi is a freakin pussy.  Sabine gets run through with a lightsaber and is up and at 'em in the next episode.  Obi Wan gets struck down with a lightsaber and dies and disappears.  The Force is truly Female.  Women are the superior Jedi warriors and don't up and die at the slightest poke of a lightsaber.
😁😁😁😁😁😁
Surprised he didnt bring up how this show was partially sold as Anakin Skywalker's big return and Hayden Christensens chance to shine in the role again and the Disney fans collectively agreed that was true and deleted the Obi-Wan Kenobi from their brains and went with it.
It's perfect
that tibia/shin joke slipped right under the radar for me at first
genuinely cant believe ryan hasn't tackled one piece yet. It's so damn easy to disect it's almost too easy. I thought it was great, though. Pirates allergic to water is tight.
Are you gonna do a pitch meeting for Andor?
I'm so glad Kathleen Kennedy made it so I don't care about Star Wars anymore. She's saved me SO much money and time!
You forgot to mention that after finding Thrawn, Ahsoka doesn't seem to care about him getting away again... It's like she was just needed to check it off the bucket list.
Wait, so when I type my social security number here some people may see that?!
Hey! would you ever do a Q&A ? I'm interested to know how you watch series considering you have to make a video later and if that affects your enjoyment or if you have to watch a series multiple times.
Best Beard in the Galaxy. RIP
This shit is so confusing I'm just hoping I lost my mind and didn't hear about any of this shit at all
Damn I thought it was good until you broke it down.
Will always laugh at how Pitch Meeting just skipped over ANDOR 🤣given how good it is
No mention about how the map is the exact same map as the one from treasure planet?
The best beard in the galaxy for sure! Made me do a legit spit take 😂
Perfect pitch. What a terrible series.
Tibia!😂😅
Ahsoka was so so so so bad...
It's Ok 👍
If I had a penny for every time I thought "Disney can't get worse than this" I'd have at least a dollar...
I give up I've decided
Ryan putting "spoilers alert" message even knowing that no one cares and will watch it anyway is TIGHT!!
I noticed he never did an Andor Pitch Meeting. It’s just that good apparently.
Drop this show on the fist ep, minute 15. I was so lost!
1:14 Yeah exactly, you know only the same tool that Qui-Gon Jinn used to melt a massive steel door in seconds so that same tool through the body, not a problem if you're a main character  lightsabers through that exact same spot never kill anyone pssh what it's not like we saw Kylo Ren do that to his father and look he liv- oh he didn't live, no oops oopsie! 🤣
Ahsoka Season 1 summed up: Ahsoka and Sabine go to another galaxy, facilitate Thrawn and Ezra returning to the SW galaxy, and get stuck there instead. *_ If you can sum up 3 movies worth of time in a single sentence, you've not put enough effort into the story and writing as you think you have. Just a note for Filoni and co. _*
very surprised he didn't make a Gandalf joke
well, if all that was able to be summed up in just 6 minutes,  I guess it's safe to assume that I didn't miss anything by NOT WATCHING AHSOKA 🤔😆😆
I miss when Pitch Meeting used to be good. Pointing out actual issues with satire. Now they are just a loser shitting on everything. They basically try as hard as they can to not understand things.
Oh wow.... really wish i hadnt seen this. I'm a sucker for Anakin. My 3rd favorite fictional character, really. So i was gonna finally get Disney+ and catch up with the MCU and Star Wars after seeing clips of Anakin's scenes. I ignored the bad talkikg because everyone likes to be negative these days. This and Obi-Wan had Anakin!   But oh no...
Now that Pitch Meeting and Honest Trailers have released their takes, more people are going to start realizing how bland this show was 😂
THIS!  Also, this show was another huge letdown.  Dave Filoni is very creative but the dude writes awful dialogue.
So now Ashoka can't figure her map cause it's a ball...
Only true Legends fans know that surviving a lightsaber stab is pretty common.
I was really hoping you would bring up the fact that Thrawn just happened to end up in this other galaxy, which an ancient order of witches had drawn up directions to, rather than any of the other galaxies that presumably don't have maps that tell you how to get there safely. What are the odds that there are even two ancient temples sitting around with hyperspace routes to nearby galaxies written into data spheres?
Season 2 will feature Reva as she has returned to being a Jedi and is more powerful than Sabine and Ahsoka.
Waiting for the one piece live action pitch meeting!!
I didn't even realize Polo's apprentice had a name.
The biggest advantage of having seen this is I now don't have to get a disney subscription for another year. Saves loads. Also it's funnier than the original.
I've seen so much online hype around this show and yet I've never met anyone that's watched it nor have I watched it. And judging by the ratings, the numbers are overinflated, but then again, Disney's been one to skew numbers repeatedly in their favor. Glad I didn't watch it (Or really anything star-wars related in the last couple years)
I was expecting you saved the barely an inconvenience for the stabbing. Looks my expectations were subverted.
I didn't noticed before but yeah...she didn't cried, hugged or confess nothing to Ezra. The whole show was about that moment 😕  Emotionless legacy characters are TIGHT!
Jesus Christ this show was so bad,she was such a boring character, always crossing her arms 😂😂😂 so ridiculous
I watched it. The entire story and writing are like aliens  learned about writing Earth fiction from only watching CW superhero shows.
Plopped out. 🤣
Honestly I didn't hear a thing they said after that fart joke. Save those babies for the end.
"Tibia" only anatomy guys would get that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Between Sabine in Ahsoka and Reva in Obi Wan, it seems lightsaber wounds really aren't that dangerous. I think if I were using one I'd make a point of slicing sideways after an attack so it was more than just a puncture wound. Just be safe, you know.
That tibia/shin pun is why I love this channel
OMFG, you nailed how much of a letdown the series was. One of the BEST characters in star wars and she gets just destroyed in this series.
*Me who didn't know Ahsoka even started*
The force is no longer special or unique
Is the whole show as dark and gray and desaturated as these clips? It's like the whole show takes place in that cave on Dagobah Yoda sends Luke to.
Accurate
Lmao "Spoilers" as if I had any plans to watch anything "Ahsoka" other than this video. 😂
The fact that this show wasn’t marketed as Rebels Season 5 is absolutely baffling
Season 2: the swap backening
Ooohh, getting a haircut inbetween character recordings is TIGHT!
Isn't that the map from Treasure Planet?
“Best beard in the galaxy” 🤣😂
😂😂😂 absolutely brilliant and well worth the wait. Thank you.👍 Better than the show 😂😂😂
Honestly, I still haven't the slightest idea what happened in this TV show after watching this
just like Andor , setting up next season
Girl power in full effect
Thank you so much Mr. Ryan for ur valuable services. You save us from the horror of watching these films.
Is Ryan’s back okay? I can’t imagine the strain from carrying screen rant on his back for so long.
So very glad I skipped even checking this garbage out. Filoni writes Star Wars from the perspective of a child.
President Scrube - SSN 123-45-6789
I'm amazed if Disney hires bad writers, or if they change what good writers create 😐.
Sabine is force sensitive, why?
Getting stabbed by a lightsaber is super easy barely an inconvenience.
🤸🚀... 🎥... 📺😳🤧  *"NUFF SAID"™️*
Stopped watching the show after episode 3, it was so bad.
"Do you think perhaps Dave Filloni's directing style, which barely worked for animated characters, might result in painfully stilted live-action performances?"  " Nope!" " Well okay then!"
As someone who has never watched any Star Wars apart from most of the movies I only have one question: What?
Galaxies are big.
Isn't ezra a jedi ?
Damn, early today
I love these space balls series 👍🏻
Super easy, Baylan inconvenience.
All these new Disney star wars are complete trash.  Well... Andor was actually kinda good but the rest suck.
Ah Ahsoka. The final nail in the coffin. It was nice, Star Wars, but it's done. I'll eagerly await your Andor season 2 and then I'm ready to say bye bye.
It certainly seems like you two just saved me several hours of my life.
Disney and Filphoni realized their was only so much stupid in that one galaxy far far away and had to go to another in order to write about some more stupid.
Yep, that pretty much captured the essence of the show.
Disney sure does love impaling characters harmlessly on lightsabers.
Holy crap why does that evil blue space raisin look a lot like Elon Musk with better hair tho
Ahsoka has some well choreographed lightsaber battles and at times (especially the dream sequence with Ani) looks gorgeous on OLED with HDR and RIFE AI 3x frame rate.  Acting is mostly solid after episode 3 too but like this pitch meeting shows the story is just too filled with gaping holes and gimmicks.  Also, the fact that none of the many enemies Sabine encounters never tries a leg shot absolutely decimates the suspension of disbelief. I did like the way the actress sold the laser blasts to her armor though. Felt authentic.  Thrown was disappointing as well. Should have got a actor with a better physique and physical presence to play him and they should have given him solid red eyes that glowed.
Can you please do Pitch Meetings for Star Wars the Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels?
Calling the character named Shin 'Tibia' was one of your most clever jokes.
I just didnt like this show at all. Andor was so good the rest of star wars is ruined.
- It must be hard still watching Star Wars - Actually is sup... I got nothing
Love this video, caught all the major points 👍 Best thing about this show was the Fallen Jedi
Watching a Pitch Meeting of a show you haven't watched is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This was such a huge letdown. The show, not the Pitch Meeting 😜
The last episode was such a let down, I was the entire series thinking "ok, Sabine's (quite frankly) betrayal will have some interesting payoff", but nope, Nobody cares she doomed the galaxy because she got a bit lonely... God that was bad...
Pretty sure Ahsoka just suffered a bit of brain damage while submerged and cooled. No "World between worlds", folks. Just her brain trying to make sense of it all while slowly dying...
Ohhhhh Watching pitch meetings for shows that you'll never watch is TIGHT !!!
3:08 Ok, so I will point out that her using the space whale to travel has some logic to it. The map they got wasn't actually "To Thrawn", it was a map that had documented the migration patterns of the whales. Since Thrawn got taken by the whales, it would make sense that he would be at a planet along their migration path. The question that brings up, though, is why Ahsoka had never thought to also just ride a whale to go retrieve Ezra anytime in the last 7 years, or why they act like they're stranded when they could conceivably just fly one back home now.
I feel like whenever the pitch meeting is about a thinly veiled cash grab in an overly milked IP, it should be Screenwriter guy who says "So, you have a tv series for me?"
hi pitch meeting guy can you make the expendables pitch meeting🙃
There was so much wrong with Ahsoka that I'm not even sure even Ryan covered all the worst bits. #1 is probably Sabine deciding her need to see Ezra again trumps the wellbeing of everyone else in the Republic.  Oh, wait, here's one he missed. If the Star Destroyer needs a giant hyperspace booster to travel between galaxies, how did it get there in the first place?
you always bring me a good laugh big Ry
Tibia lmao
I didn't understand anything about this show or the events or characters or anything
Been waiting for this pitch meeting for a while now. Does not dissapoint xD
Kill a fart lmao
Omg this show is so stupid. Too much staring, vagues scripts, dumb decisions, and unconvincing fight sequence. It feels like it could be compressed into just one movie. A bad one.
Can... can we have a show about those hyperspace whales? Because now I really want a show about hyperspace whales.
Ah, ive finally figured out how HP works in these new star wars. They all work on OG COD zombies logic, 2 hits downs them but 1 hit only puts them in critical condition that regenerates after 10 seconds.
Much better use of our time than watching the actual show.
I accidentally sneezed some chili powder into my eye while watching this and I would prefer to keep doing that rather than watch A shoka.
That ball map was stolen from Treasure Planet!
Halloween time: please do old school Ghostbusters!
Producer guy looking kinda laid back, he needs to tighten up  by buttoning up and switching out that loud shirt. I think hes hanging with Writer guy too much, probably best if Producer guy goes to the country club to play some golf this weekend with the rest of corporate instead of hitting the bars with Writer guy.
Based on the pattern, I can only imagine every single storm trooper is a female. Apparently you only get to be a male in Star Wars now, if you’re the main bad guy
I enjoyed this series while it was unfolding, but the cracks are showing pretty quickly now that it's over. By the end, I found myself much more interested in where Shin and Baylan's story was headed. Ahsoka and Sabine not so much. Ezra, Hera, and Thrawn? Sure, I'm down for that story. :P
I like that Ryan could not hold back the chuckle at how dumb the lightsaber on the wings scene was..
"she was tickled by lightsaber",  poor Qui-Gon Jinn why he have to die?
Thank you!!!! That was great! No rebels references or clone wars references though?
*it truly was awful huh.* didnt have to be. _JC
No need to watch it now :)
Ryan makes all the valid critical points all those "hateful and toxic fans" make feel fun and accessible.  Thank you for your service, buddy.
Surviving a lightsaber stab is super easy barely an inconvenience! Unless you're Gui-Gon Jinn
Although this is my favourite YT channel, this pitch meeting was pretty depressing. Star Wars is totally dead and everybody involved needs to be dismissed immediately.
Aw, you didn't highlight the restraint it took to not include the Mandalorian in 2 to 3 episodes
Quick question , its about  spider man across the spiderverse , was it so good that there was nothing  you could make fun of because it has been a couple of months  since it was came out  so  i needed to ask that
It’s not even a parody of bad plot lines anymore, you pretty much just give a summary of the show and the jokes write themselves
Not having to watch Garbage Star Wars content is tight!!
I’m starting to think that Dave Filoni was NOT the brilliant storyteller I thought he was.
Oh Ryan! Thanks for helping me stay connected with Star Wars without having to watch the shows
This was exactly like what the sequel trilogy did to the original trilogy: completely negated the great sacrifice of a character to bring back an old foe for the sake of making new content and not having any original ideas.
I swear it's different eye graphics each time
I missed the last 10s of the video, so... 1751/02/04-7898
How can people like something like this?  I believe Hollyweird has been putting so much shit lately, some people can't even understand the difference between a good and a bad show...
Yeah, it was dumb when you start to look at the series - between this Pitch meeting and Honest Trailers
I have no idea what the plot of this is, and I couldn't care less. Gibberish show.
1:37 NOT GOOD! i fucking died
My man rockin that blue and yellow...
Wait, his name is Balin? "Mornin'! Nice day for fishin', ain't it? Huh-hah!" If you know, you know...
Call me crazy, but I don't think Ryan saw the Star Wars cartoons that connect to Ahsoka
I'm sure this was a great pitch meeting, but I was too distracted by Producer Guy's yellow shirt to really pay attention
U can’t convince me AI couldn’t write a better script
The Farce is strong with this one!.💤
Smirk wars
Better call saul pitch meeting? 🙏🙏🙏
A literal waste of time. You get nothing out of watching it, not even entertainment. At least we got this pitch meeting I guess.
I didn't watch Ahsoka, but I took it for granted that Thrawn would come back to the galaxy.
Never watching any Disney show but watching all the pitch meeting is tight
1:21 😆😆😆
Watching every Disney show and movie can't be good for your health. I admire your dedication.
I'm glad I'm not the only one how was calling her out for having ONE emption W/smirk
I appreciate these videos so I don't have to watch the show
"Characters can only be as smart as the people writing them."
Awokea, achokea,asucka,,,😂
Mon Mothma in Andor deals with tough ethical dilemmas and make political deals to fund the rebellion.  Mon Mothma in Ahsoka "Look everyone, it’s Threepio!"
That Tibia joke got me
The amount of questionable decisions that took place in ahsoka makes me wonder if maybe, just maybe I could be a script Writer guy myself, because honestly, they don't know what they are doing either!
That tibia joke really caught me off guard, nice one Ryan 🤣
The inarticulate, puzzled grunts from producer guy are just perfect. 🤣
no one questioning this woman that endangered the entire galaxy for one dude she doesn't even break down or hug or say how much she missed is nuts. Gotta be a strong woman. No emotions allowed here, no sir
The Ryans could've gotten 6 pitch meetings out of this show.
Liking your videos, and subscribing to your channel is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Why did that "Not good" made me crack up so much at 1:37  Lol I am stuck in a loop of Not good, not good, not good...
Can you guys please do Only Murders in the Building?
Can you do a pitch meeting for cobra kai?
Watching a new Pitch Meeting just as it comes out? Super easy - barely an inconvenience.
I have a tiny inkling that the Star Wars shows became kind of stupid
Your name and social security number
Reviewing this before Andor is NOT TIGHT!
Ah yes - Starfighter blasters deflected by lightsabers.   wait.... howcome  Howcome all the deaths I remember from childhood Star Wars games are rushing into my brain!?!?!
Watching Pitch Meetings about Star Wars shows instead of watching the actual show is TIGHT!!!
I feel like calling the Threepio cameo just something for nostalgia is a little uncalled for, considering it was a way to get around not being able to have Leia present. Seeing as they've done digital editing for Luke, it's pretty obvious the only reason they didn't for Leia is out of respect for Carrie Fisher dying. Just a lil in poor taste, y'know? Otherwise, great vid as always!
Enemies from another galaxy. Is the show setting up ykosan van (i know, the spelling is off)?
Letting giant tentacle whales up in your space is tight.
I feel bad you had to watch this show for our amusement
Southland tales
Disney: Hey, Dave, we need more filler on D+ so how about this? You make a series about that Ahsoka whoever you made and bring in some of her friends. Filoni: Yay, I get to finally make a series about my most famous and beloved female characters! We can get Sabine and Hera-- Disney: Yes, and their mission is going to be: "Find the men!" Filoni: What? Disney: Money or not? Filoni: Okay....
Jeepers creepers 3 or Jeepers Creepers reborn pitch plz ;-; pitch meetings for bad movies is TIGHT
Very funny.  I still really liked Ahsoka though.
Star Wars went from a relatively simple, straightforward, good vs evil, heroes journey, to a bloated, convoluted, self referential and derivative mess.
Uuuunclear 😂😂😂😂
My favorite part was when Ashoka and Sabine, uh... ah, screw it.
Super easy barly an inconvenience
Ahsoka was a show of missed opportunities. it had all the ingredients to make an incredible story, including legacy characters that everybody already cared about. the rebels tv show had what this show did'nt, that being engaging writing and meaningful characters, that had actual emotions. I'm still just blown away by how badly disney screwed this one up.
Thanks for watching this show so that we dont have to 😂
Ball shaped map in a space adventure story? Never seen that before
Hang on.......Ryan didn't say 'Whoopsy'. I sense a disturbance in the force.
Ezra not being younger and having blue hair is just terrible
Producer Guy: So what's the macguffin for this show?  Screenwriter Guy: It's the map from the movie Treasure Planet   Producer Guy: What's Treasure Planet?  Screenwriter Guy: It's a movie we made that bombed in the box office but gained a cult following
With the half thought out plots, are we sure they haven't been using AI to write everything for much longer.
Suprised he didn't talk about the crab people having 3x more screentime than both the main villains combined in the finale
Just hearing it spelled out really does make it look as bad as everyone says it was.
Yes I've been checking for a new one!!
Do "The Owl House" Pitch meeting plize.
Ironically, Lucasfilm managed to butcher the character arcs of their female leads more than their male ones this time around.
A "plop" is a VERY accurate description of Disney+ content.
Do Expand4bles or however it's written. It's so bad
Star Wars has been one big 'plot armor' set in space since Force Awakens.
Being tickled by a lightsaber is tight.
Who is this Tibia person? Choked on my drink
Watching this pitch meeting is better than watching Ahsoka itself.
The workplace ambience background noise could do with fewer decibels. It doesn't add much to the sketch and is slightly annoying.
So lightsaber wounds are not fatal anymore? Barely an inconvenience now?
Shoulda got rid of the ambient noise for this episode to show how many people not watching and also the overall in this series
Still never explained how nightsisters created the map
Two things I used to love (Star Wars and Marvel) have now become nothing more than content for Pitch Meetings to me
If you get stabbed by a lightsaber, you die.
"So then on a near by planet Ahsoka's gonna manage to kill a fart." Dear god, this sent my sides into orbit. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Literally 2 minutes before this was posted I sat down with my lunch and found I had nothing to watch. Then, suddenly :O
I love these pitch meetings. I couldn’t make it through this one though. Way too much nonsense. It’s frustrating to just hear.
Phew.. Looks like i dodged a bullet by skipping that..
Ahsoka had the dumbest plot and the most annoying bit... protagonists.
Watching this, how bored are humans really?? smh
Andor pitch meeting.
I don't understand why they sucked the joy, emotion, and life out of a whole cast of beloved characters. Ahsoka is not a stoic monster, and Sabine and Ezra DEFINITELY aren't. And did I miss some hints in the cartoon series about Sabine being force-sensitive? That seems like it comes out of nowhere, unless I'm remembering wrong.
The fact you didn't even mention Huyang! Which make sense since he's just there for comic relief and nostalgia.
Maybe I'm showing my age but the whole "lightsaber combat in space" thing made me remember West End Games Star Wars RPG explicitly pointing out that vehicle-scale weapons can't be deflected by lightsabers.
Do One Piece LA next
These guys make my week, every week. Love them dudes, awesome. 👏
Watching the pitch meeting instead of the show is super easy barely an inconvenience
Uhhh, is this the first Pitch Meeting where writer guy and producer guy have different haircuts?
Do the Blade movies. Also nice shirt Producer Guy 👍
ruining star wars is super easy barely an inconvenience
I am very tempted to leave my name and social security number as a joke damn you.
Disney: Getting impaled by a lightsaber is meaningless. Qui Gon Jin: Am I joke to you? Edit: Oh God, what have I done, I was just trying to make a joke, not start an argument.
I can feel the anger flowing through you. Good. Gooooood!
Producer guy and screenwriter guy having different haircuts is a nice touch.
Ryan spent way more time, effort, and writing on this video than the entire production of Ashoka.
I pity Ryan, he had to watch Ass-hoka & take notes, poor Ryan
Great summary of all the BS that happened in the series. Oh man how can anyone take now SW seriously? Well except for the seal-clappers who wil be pleased with every nostalgia bait and as long as SW logo is on it.
MCU Vs Star Wars is happening sooner than later
I don't know how you can make Ahsoka boring, but Disney sure managed it. I'm going to have to rewatch Clone Wars to cleanse my palate.
you have different haircuts today!!
Can we just appreciate Ryan getting a haircut after recording Screenwriter Guy's lines and before recording Producer Guy's lines.
i have waited a long time for this moment
Great osteologic joke!
Honestly, the space whale idea was a bit too much for me.
Thanks. Now I don't need to watch it. Saved me some time.
I was watching debates then pitch meeting popped up.... Dropped everything hehehe
Stormtrooper: sir we’ve found the enemy in a vulnerable spot. *Thrawn: send 2 stormtroopers.* Stormtrooper: Well sir they both died but the enemy stubbed their toe on a rock while fighting. *Thrawn: Hm.. an acceptable loss.*
Sabine's choice to give away the map was a lot more nuanced then its given credit for
Just saved like 6hours of hurt... thanks Ryan.
cool stuff standard good stuff....."whats up with this....Tibia person?" AHAHAH
*Sabine gets impaled by a lightsaber*  _Sabine: 'Tis but a flesh wound!_
Some farts actually are tight!
Elemental  Puss in Boots 2  One piece Netflix  Tmnt mutant mayhem  Across the spider verse pitch meeting
23rd!
To the "Best Beard in the Galaxy"
Oh NO! Zombie Stormtroopers! They are..... not a threat at all.
"Is that not bad?"... "Not ANYMORE no... That's meaningless"  Pretty much explains new Star Wars stuff. Qui-Gon Dies Sabine lives, same lightsaber wound. Anyways did anyone notice that Producer guy and Screenwriter guy have different hairstyles now?
You should do some pitch meetings for some of the real old classics. Like Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, From here to Eternity, or Ben Hur. Or any of the many great movies made before 1970.
I appreciate the shin and tibia joke
Ήτανε δίκαιο και έγινε πράξη
The name "Ezra" really is dead to me, because all I can think about is Ezra Miller.....
This whole time Han Solo and Qui-Gon jinn have overreacted to being tickled with a lightsaber
I forgot it was Thursday. I’m watching it NOW.
Why is your beard so beardy?
10/10 shin pun
I love you recorded screen writer guy bit before hitting the barbershop
Hahahahahahahaahha!  Exactly!!!!
For a death!😂
Love how he didnt even bring up Hera cus she was completely useless for the story
One Piece Live Action pitch meeting when?
Someone really did watch Rise of Skywalker & thought they'd give the 'scavenger hunt to a deadly dictator' story mechanic another go, didn't they?
Screen Rant's traffic and views really went down after Pitch Meeting got it's own channel.
TIGHT
As much as I hate lightsaber wounds not being fatal, I've got to admit that Sabine definitely wasn't stabbed anywhere fatal so it made sense for her to survive
1:50 Even scriptwriter guy can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it was for Ahsoka to get out of the ship.
I forgot I was watching this show while watching it. Thank you for reminding me that I did a bit of time.
This is probably legitimately how this went down
stopping a fart is tight
How are we gonna get fans back into Star Wars after the last few shows have flopped? Dave filoni “ Actually it’s gonna be super easy. Barely an inconvenience. “
showing up 5 minutes after release is TIGHT!
DIFFERENT HAIR WTF!?!?!
It felt like a more bland version of an animated show, especially Ashoka but a lot of others felt quite wooden, I didnt get a thematic thru line in the story, I forgot about baylan in the last episode, and the ending was like a cliff hanger without tension, not resolving things but not building showing us an immediate threat. I did like some parts of the fights, some acting and all the witch look and sound was really cool but idk, it was pretty enjoyable overall ig but didnt leave me with much
Apparently not is back 😮
Spoilers ahead.  You can’t spoil crap.
Oh, so the producer guy is that ifunny ashoka account, good to know
I'm liking producer guys new cut, screen writer guy really should call up his barber, smh
Ok, I had low expectations for the show, but judging from this Pitch Meeting, it's even worse than I could possibly have imagined.
Glad I don't have to watch the show after This Pitch Meeting. Can't wait for Loki  season 2 pitch meeting.
Stopping a fart is tight!
Yet another show/movie where I’m far more hyped for the pitch meeting than the actual show/movie
"Is that not bad?"  "Not anymore, no. That's meaningless. She's up and at 'em in the next episode."
The spoiler alerts for Ahsoka makes me laugh, cause barely anything f—King happens
"tickled by a lightsaber" should be the title of Weird Al's next Star Wars-themed parody
Now I know the Producer and the Writer are different people... they don't have the same haircut, for one!
I always assumed you stopped a fart by being tight.
I was so sad when I heard Ray Stevenson died. I loved his role in the show Rome, and he was also fantastic in Vikings.
Catching new Pitch Meetings before Youtube can even send me a notification is super easy barely an inconvenience! ❤
What the hell is a soaker?
Disney Corp. (TM) (R) (C) will milk its Star Wars property until its dead.   So… I’m saying probably until some time next year or so
Is Producer Guy feeling alright? He looks like he had a couple rough days going on. I hope he's okay.
The Pitch Meetings are always more entertaining than the actual show or film.
So much potential wasted... also great joke at the beginning haha
I'm sorry, but the producer and script guy look WAY too similar in this one.  I'm starting to suspect they are the same person.
Do "Across The Spider-Verse" or is Mile Morales too black for you?
But, won't it be difficult to destroy the entire Star Wars franchise built by George Lucas?  Disney: Barely an inconvenience
Stopping in the middle of work to watch a new episode of pitch meetings is TIGHT!
Oh boy, more Star Wars Milk!
Total fake out not using the "barely an inconvenience" when Sabine gets stabbed!
Day 34 of asking for a one piece red film pitch meeting
Oh, not doing your schoolwork so you can comment on this video is TIGHT!
That’s the goddam map orb from Treasure Planet
So glad to see this. Ahsoka is absolutely, unbelievably terrible and is hugely crapping on the legacy of _Rebels,_ which was an amazing show. As far as I can tell all _Ahsoka_ is is a very shameless cash grab exploiting people's love of characters. Just like most Disney Star Wars crap at this point.
Every time someone survives a stabbing, ghost Qui-Gon sheds a tear
I’ve yet to see any Marvel or Star Wars shows, but I have seen every pitch meeting, so I feel up to date.
Is this the first time that Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy are sporting different hairdos??
Typically, turning pieces on a puzzle like that ends up with Cenobites showing up and ruining everything
catching a Pitch Meeting 2 minutes after it uploaded is TIGHT!
Oh i was waiting for this
Tickled by a lightsaber....  HAHAHA!!!!!!!!
Nothing better than a little plopping...
“What else?” “Not much.”  Sums it up perfectly right there.
Nostalgia? Recognizing characters? Live action with little emotion? Existing IP? Throw in a side character who has no real purpose being there for safe measures and we will SURELY have a winner this time.
I'm so glad I never watched this show, it sounds absolutely terrible.
Give us a pitch meeting for Braveheart, you English coward!
Y’all people camp here on the comment section 😹😹😹
Oop just 22 comments
Long live Producer Guy and Writer Guy, who are of course two distinct people
I was there, Gandalf. I was there 1 minute after it was uploaded!
I loved the part when Ahsoka said "it's snipsing time" and  snipped all over the place
PLEASE DO A PITCH MEETING ABOUT DISNEY'S NEW "PETER PAN" - "PETER PAN AND WENDY"!!! 😓💔
gonna count this as watching the show
super early, barley an inconvenience.
Ahsoka was definitely a show that was written, directed, and produced.
Most interesting original content on youtube !!
I've never clicked on a notification so fast.
Please do a Pitch Meeting about Netflix's "One Piece."
New plopping....😂😂😂😂
Cant believe this didn't open with a joke about "remember her from the Mandalorian" To reference all the backdoor pilots they did in season 2
Yoo
I clicked as fast as I could.
This certainly was one of the Disney+ shows that was ever produced! No doubt about it.
Ahsoka proves that Star Wars fans will watch any old shit.
.
let's go!!
First !!!!
im ready for the whales
Ohhh,this was 𝙏𝙄𝙂𝙃𝙏!
Yes sir I do
Right for my birthday 🎉
41 s
Wow
Damn
first comment, super easy barely an inconvenience
I would love to see a Memento pitch meeting!
I didn’t watch a single episode
Stopping with what your doing and watching Pitch meetings instead is tight!
Big Plopping is tight!
Great vid!
Anyone else laughed at the Spoiler warning?
I'm here!!!!!
Due for a Pitch Meeting ploppin’
Being first to the party is TIGHT
This certainly was one of the Disney+ shows that was ever produced
First one here
These are honestly the greatest videos ever
Super early, barely an inconvenience.
Hi, hello
Woooo😂
