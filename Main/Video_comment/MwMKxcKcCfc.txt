RIP to your mother, I know that is the fuel to your energy. Just remember being a demon is not what a black man's literature has foretold. You must learn. But you'll see how professing as a dark energy will turn out at the end of your journey. Hope you find peace young man,

They never did nothing too a gd Nigga😂😂
Ya this Hard
Really🤔
They sleeping on y'all for real
This that kinda energy that gets their haters all ramped up - then one of the haters ends up shooting them at a mall or something because the song was on that type of energy to begin with. Folks be asking for it when they radiate it. Then their streams go thru the roof for like a week after they die, then we move on to the next act.  I wish our young brothas would see this pattern and find a way to do somethin more creative with their talents other than wish death upon themselves like this.
Fivio putting on everybody them youn niggas hard
So proud of these guys man 😢😢
THIS. ONE. THOUGH.
🔥
The rapper yelling his lyrics needs to lower his voice. I don't think it's necessary

Guess you found that number to the illuminati, sad because I know the truth. No father, mother passed away. Hurt people hurt people. We must be better. When did we as brothers start worshipping evil. The devil isn't real, the voices your hearing in your head is your brain and what you watch on television and social media is training your brain. .
The beat is harder than my life 🔥🔥🔥
Yea bk still putting on its not only the bronx💯🔥💫

Why r ppl gdk in NYC.  I don't get that. There is some GD obv. Brooklyn a lot I heard . But tbh gdk seem to.b a trend now. How u gonna have opps u never met or whatever.  There's probably more politics involved that I'm unaware of its jus imo it seem like a trend . But who knows. I'm neither.  I'm neutral so I'm only speaking on what I c , hear, n observe.

Sir kyle rich I want to thank you for this beautiful song, I can't express this feeling I'm experiencing right now. When my ear lobes come into contact with the sound waves of your music my body elegantly starts getting sturdy these inexplicable feelings that u make me feel is the whole entirety of the reason why I watch you sir kyle richh. Your music is equivalent to the stars colliding and forming the most powerful luminous stellar explosion also known as supernova and the nuclear fusion it takes to make this is just immense but to you it is one of many several explosions you make evertime vou drop a song sir kyle richh.
Drop this in Apple Music 🥵
