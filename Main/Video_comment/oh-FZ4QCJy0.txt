Is it just me or does she say lEgiNs
There was a store call service merchandise back in the 80s that was like this. One idem out. Scan, and they would have it packed and ready for you at the end of the shop. They had everything, TV's, blenders, and couches, kids' toys, everything. It was nice not to carry everything while shopping. I was sad when it closed. I loved shopping there. I had planned on registration for my wedding there, but it closed before I got married.😢

I love you so much hope

As the Mama of a son on the Autism Spectrum, I can definitely see this being a FABULOUS idea for neurodivergent individuals even if that wasn’t its original intention! 🤷🏻‍♀️👏🏻 I only hope 😉 that this spreads throughout other countries and not just the major one or two cities! 🤞🏻
Why is thag making me laugh so much 🤣😆😆😆 7:50
As someone with chronic back pain due to injury to one of my spinal discs years ago and chronic anemia this sounds wonderful that I don't have to carry anything with me and can just to directly to fitting rooms and the stuff will be there ready for me to try on.
Oh my God I never knew the story ever
You’re the best you tuber in the world. I love you love you love you love you love you love,
Love you videos
When I worked at express I was always saying we should just have 1 item for people to look at n we can being them their sizes. 😂 cleaning after people who throw clothes on the floor is just a headache. Like other people have to try these on too and then eventually someone's gonna buy it. There's dust, dirt and other things people drop on the floor
you are so inspiring love form chico CA💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

So cool 🤩💅
I love watching your videos. They help so much with my depression and getting me out of a bad mood. It's so entertaining. And I love that you donate a lot and do so much good for others. I would be over the moon if you could help me and the kids for Christmas this year. Any donations of items you don't want or need out of your way. I know there's so many people out there struggling and I'm not the only one but I've been through so much in the past few years that I wish just one good thing could happen for us. I got my nieces out of a terrible situation and raising them. Things were good at first until I became sick and lost my job. I do cleaning jobs on the side and they help me on my really bad health days just to be able to keep a roof over our heads and things they absolutely need. More than anything I just wish I could get better and back to living my life and giving them the life they deserve. I have been trying to come up with something for Christmas for them and I either have a really bad health day and cant do extra cleaning jobs or something comes up like I had to replace a tire that keeps going flat, pay for school pictures and one had a school dance etc. I cant ever get ahead. I've called programs that help around Christmas time but they only help so many and all the spots are filled. It's the worst feeling to know I'll have nothing to give them Christmas morning and they don't understand because they're kids and it's not fair to them. I feel like such a failure because I was supposed to make things better for them and then I became sick out of nowhere and everything changed. My priority is keeping a roof over their heads, utilities on and food in their stomachs and I'm doing that just barely but I know they will be sad and so will I if I can't make something happen by Christmas. And I know this is so annoying but there's nothing I wouldn't do for them and I can at least try and hope that maybe you might see this and decide you would like to help a family in desperate need who would be more grateful and appreciative than you could ever know. I'm just asking if you have anything that you were going to donate, throw out, sell for a penny lol I can afford that! Etc please consider me and my girls. It can even be used items. I just want to make them happy. I would record the excitement and smiles on their faces and probably tears coming from mine if something happened. If you would like to know more about my situation or want to bless my family with donations, you can reach out ashleyy.mariee1989@gmail it would be greatly appreciated but either way I still love you and your videos! Thank you! 💜
Don
I love this vid and I want to go there

This definitely prevents shoplifting and minimizes loss damages in retail, which in turn reduces insurance costs and passes on the savings to the end consumers to make products more affordable.

I LOVE YOU HOPE
All your video are so fun to watch
Hi
Hi I love Amazon and I would love a gift card love your vids
Hiii
seems like an AMAZING concept, sizing at the door, but they haven't worked out the kinks.  did sizing at the door help you at all while shopping?  edit: the more I watch this..... how?  you must have to pay to get in or wait in a line...theres no way they could have enough employees to basically cater to every shopper.....that would be so next level.... so whats the catch here?
Hey
I'm not quite sure for this store
I love your videos they’re so fun🌻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Hey I went to ur store and everything  was  sold out !?!
Great idea, but, not for me at this time. I will stick with regular Amazon. I find everything I need or want on their website! I was purchasing clothing on Amazon when everyone else were just purchasing music, books or videos! Amazon has been a life saver & changer for me!
I love your videos so much ! Keep doing what you do best!
i  love amazon and this looks so cool:0
I LOVE that she says “Hi hopefulls” idk why it just gets to me makes me feel all warm inside🙃
❤
I freakin loove ur vidoes
Hi (●’◡’●)ﾉ
This is new level shopping
This seems like my dream store and shopping experience! I wish it was in Ireland!
Depression is coming harder people, internet is becoming the reality of people. That's so sad.
WHAT ABOUT IF YOU DONT HAVE BATTERY. THATS CRAZY.
Wow this video gave me a bad ANXIETY. people are making something easy into complicated. You have to be carrying your phone all the time and checking everything. I wander where all those unemployed people are gonna work at.
That is so cool! Its my dream to go there now! I love shopping that is so freaking cool! Its like the futures of shopping!
why the nah. tho
preying that this is the future for clothes stores
The blue one you tried in the store was real good it looked soooo good on you I wish you could have bought it
Hope your content is so amazing and your hair is SOOO pretty

This kinda weirds me out. Everything is changing so fast & I want my 90’s world baaaaack!!😭😆☺️☺️☺️
yeah...what if you don't have a cell phone? They really don't think about that anymore.
Hi
Hope!!! I love this video! Is this the future concept of shopping??? I wonder if “unavailable for try on” means someone else was trying them on? Maybe? Love you!!  Longtime sub @aniam0
I hate Amazon and I hate how they treated you, but this store concept is spot on!
Hello
IM DONE
Hey
I have been trying too find leggings with good prices

Can you repost the link for the outfits? I want the 2  green piece!!!
I like how she was like it is like going into a Louis Vuitton store and show pictures of a Gucci store
Amazing
That looks fun
Does anyone know how I can find that last dress? I love it! Can't seem to find it
"They were like Nah"😭😭😭
You are so inspiring
Dun
Hey
hi
I shopped at this store a couple of weeks ago and am OBSESSED! Amazon is changing the game once again with this shopping experience! Since it seems you went opening week, I’m assuming that’s why they didn’t have some of the items you wanted available for try on. When I went, I didn’t have any issues with that. Also didn’t have any issues with the scan tags falling off so they may have fixed that. 🙃 Lastly, I can confirm this location used to be a Forever 21. It was the most chaotic F21 I’ve ever been in, so the Amazon store is a MUCH better option, imo. 🧡
You are so  beautiful!!!!!
I have those pants (6:35) love them
Hi hope i always watch your videos theyr so fun to watch i literally love you!!! <3
Omg I’m sorry but you need to tell me where you got that Cardigan from it’s so cute I love yellow and pink mixed together I need this 💖
Omg😆
Wow I love the ideas in that store especially the dressing room and how they send your stuff in different sizes to you so you don't have to leave the fitting/dressing room!! Also how you don't have to carry stuff around as you shop! I HATE trying on clothes cuz I get so hot n sweaty running around so much trying to find different sizes when something doesn't fit etc.
Emazing job
Hi I love ur videos
Hi
Lol the kid was like AHHHHHH
Hello
“Nah” that’s professional 🤦🏼‍♀️
Omg!!!! Yasss Ive always wanted a clueless styler iPad screen….
Hi
I’m so mad you didn’t get those blue dressed from the dressing room, they looked AMAZING!
Hi
But what if your phone dies?
Notifications are now on......love your energy and style
Done <3
This is so cool. I love the idea behind it and hope to see more stores do it in the future!
Hi

So much fun ! Love to see it in person.Great fun just watching .
👻👻👻👻👻👻
You didn't buy the Blue dress?? that one looked great on you!!!
The last thing you tried on at the store before you checked out was a little blue it looked like it was a printed dress. I was so disappointed you didn't buy it. It looked adorable on you! I was really really hoping you got it but you did find some really amazing things. Once again thanks for another wonderful video.
Hi! I LUV your videos!
omg that is the cutest Kahki dress...I want that...but I don't live in Burbank anymore...
Watching u made me laugh, my friend told me she had the same problem...she had better luck online then in the actual store...I don't know anyone who has been happy, ...but they so like the food shopping thou
Hi
I'm new here and already love your videos I love everything you do I've watch 25 videos in one day so far

After working in Dillards forever I absolutely love this. Maybe they will make one for items that were returned back to Amazon and cut back on waste.
i love your videos
I love shopping with friends so as I also like to get an opinnion from my friend. So this would not be for me I think.

This is so innovative, I don’t know why actual clothing shops are not doing this. It could be the key to saving the high street.
This set up is actually really interesting
love your videos
I do not know if tgis was asked and answered but how size inclusive is this set up?
Hi hoop

I love your video and I want a gift card so I can buy something for my mum.
I do want to go to one of these stores. It seems weird and interesting. It would also be amazing to with my wheels. Not having to carry things around when you need your hands to push would be awesome.
Smlyl
Hi
The fact they really said “nah.” 😂
Amazon store = semi-heaven
I wish the clothes elevator was the actual dressing room.  :D
This is so much fun for you and me 😃😃😃

Most try-on hauls: HI GUYS today we're going to do a try on haulllllllll!  Hope: TRY ON HAUL -bags flinging into an empty room-

I love  you hope so much i have watched every single video since you started filming
hi
Hi
Hi I have done the 3 thinks to win the amazon card i love your video they are the videos that I can watch anytime ever
Ok just the dressing room got me. I hate to call for someone to give me another size or just to dress again and find what I want and make the line again. So that system 10/10.
yay
How is it that you look so good in all of it I’m shook shawty
Hi
I don't know. I like to go to a shop, pick the stuff I like, try it on, pay and leave. I don't want to give the shop all my private information. And this will cause overconsumption because you are offered one thing after the other, stuff that you don't need, and eventually you will buy more than you needed and wanted. We should stop buying at Amazon, terrible company.
Ah Phil of the future
I just found this channel and this is by far my favorite video! I love this concept and you're so relatable. Officially subscribed
Gurl your beautiful!
Hello
Cute
Cool Video 😊
The whole magic closet thing  is amazing! I’m always worried I’ve got to go get a different sized because I miss judged an item
Omg! I have never had even a chance to be able to shop at a place like this, nor been able to shop online! ☹️😣 I'm on disability for life now & I've never been so frayed... plus my body type isn't the same ever since I got sick, which TOTALLY SUCKS!!!! Which, if any girl out there knows then you know what I'm talking about...🤨😪🤧 But Hope, I LOVE YOU!!!🥰😉😁 And please understand that I'm not asking for a hand-out...I just wanted to let you know my situation is all. Lots of love ❤️ from me to you!!💙💜💖💙💜💖💞💕💕💕💘💌💋
New SUB here because you deserve it.
This is actually really cool I think I’ll be taking a drive to burbank soon
Would be nice if they were a little more size inclusive though

What surprised me about this amazon store is an actual cashier. This is weird cuz Amazon Fresh and Go don't use cashiers. Why would the clothing store use a cashier?
Hi
One question I have is how are their sizes? Are they inclusive or do things only go up to 2x as I saw one of the items did
O.M.G.   MY LAST NAME IS ALLEN
Hi
You looked amazing in everything!  What a neat concept!
You should go to the Amazon grocery store for us!!😁
They are doing one of those Amazon stores here in Tampa, Florida in the international mall. I’m so excited for it!!
This needs to be in uk too
Hi
It looks like they have nothing for mens
Wow u look awesome girl 😀
Ok I’m so sorry to be Debbie Downer but I feel compelled to give a warning. I admit that this seems super cool and somewhat convenient and the closet is so cool. But beware this will lead to our every move being tracked. May not seem bad until we are living like we’re in China with social credit scores. In China you can’t do ANYTHING without your smartphone. If you leave your house without it an alarm goes off to remind you. There’s no cash in China either. The ccp controls your bank acct and if they don’t like what you’re doing they literately turn it off. If your social credit score is low an alarm goes off on the ppl around you phones. If they stay within so many feet of that person for more then do many minutes your score will go down. It’s already coming here with smart cities, smart shopping, etc. This is how they sell it to us. Fun and convenience but then it turns not so fun and anything but convenient. The powers that be are are trying to implement a digital central bank currency which will be the end of the dollar and privacy. Don’t buy into the system.
I love watching you so much
good and fun video
Love your hair this way!! Hope your so gorgeous but seem like a sweet, genuine and down to earth young lady. God bless you and family

Hi
Someone may have already mentioned this but Reformation has had dressing rooms like this for a while where you select your clothes on an iPad and they're sent to your dressing room.  Your room has a little screen in it as well where you can swap out sizes and what not as you try stuff on.
Hi

Hi

Have you ever considered looking into "slow-fashion" brands? Like the BEWILDHER leggings from Canada? I think it would be really cool for you to see how many companies are doing slow fashion to try and save on waste 🤗
<3
Hi

Ummm Amazon where is her partnership???
What was the blue dress you tried on called?
Wow that magic closet though. I hate picking the wrong size and getting redresswd and going back.for another size!
every store should do those types of fitting rooms bc the fitting room in aerie and Aritzia are horrible
This is so cool
I WOULD WANT TO WORK THIER!!  P.S iI LOVE YOUR  VIDS!!!

I see you always struggle with jeans? I myself do too! Recently discovered the American Eagle jeans and I am in love, the fit and STRETCH OMG
Okay, I absolutely love the cropped gray jacket that you tried on in the dressing room and I'm really disappointed that you didn't get it, so you would share the link for it. 😩😩😩 It's so cute on you! I mean, I know it's summer and all, but I definitely need that jacket. lol
Amazing videoo 🫶🏻🫶🏻
i love your vidos
Forever 21 be like: okay thank you amazon. I'm gonna copy that homework 😂
hey queen keep slaying
As someone who uses a rollator, I absolutely LOVE the idea of “pre-ordering” a dressing room. That way by the time I’m done looking, I don’t have to awkwardly stand in line or flag down an employee. And now that I’m using my rollator more consistently, waiting for the handicap stall to be available. These dressing rooms were so large, I’d be able to fit my rollator or my wheelchair and still have plenty of space to try on clothes.   Can’t wait to go visit when we are in LA!! I will def be making a video on how accessible (or not) this store actually is.   Edit: Coming back to say my partner and I went and it was SO FUN! I typically don’t enjoy shopping as the layout is overwhelming, and the walking around is extremely energy draining. That being said, the aisles were wide enough for my rollator and my Service Dog loose leash heeling. The associates were so attentive, and the organization made it super simple and saved me a lot of energy & walking around.   The wheelchair accessible rooms were ✨divine✨, truly made to be used by those with a wide range of mobility needs. Plenty of space to make a 3 point turn, a spot to store your chair/rollator if you are an ambulatory user, and a wide bench with a lower screen for ease of access. (I have a video up on my TT if your interested)   Say what you want about Amazon, but they always seem to include those of us with disabilities into their spaces and not as an after thought either.
I want that money
Love watching you always have. 🥰❤️
Love the fitting room process! Too bad all places couldn’t be that organized so you don’t have to keep getting dressed to fetch the right size
you are so pretty in that little blue dress i could CRY
That sounds fun
Me
I love your videos
*Oooooo, I'm excited for the future of Amazon and shopping. Love all the videos girl! Keep up the spectacular videos* 🤩💜
Love this vid
You have one of the best content on the internet right now I love it!!!

Lol love it
Helooo
I love your videos
Hi I think are so gorgeous
Love that dressing room!!
OMG I love this concept!
I love all your videos my sister introduced me to you and I thank her <3
This would make it almost impossible for people to shoplift as well since everything is scanned on your phone and can be accounted for by the employees as they bring it in/out of the dressing rooms. It would save them hundreds of thousands of dollars in shrinkage annually.
Hi
love
Omg my middle name is hope!!!!!!!!!I our old and I really wanta pier of leggings
Hiya hope...just luving your you tube videos....can u do some male stuff...luv from Belfast xx

There’s one in San Antonio called “Black Friday”…Jesus people will fight for those items lol Pretty cool spot.. found a cool jacket and 2 pairs of kids shoes all for $21. That was on a Saturday($7) Sundays was like $5 day.  It’s all returns from Amazon. 👍
i wish i lived in the us
I was excited about this by the end of your video only to be disappointed when I looked up the store and saw the pitiful size selection they carry in the store. Maybe if this is successful they will be more inclusive....at least I hope so because I'd love this but I'm too "fat" for Amazon I guess.
Hi!
can you do franchesca’s for your next “buying worst selling products” video? they have some really nice dresses ;)
Did they have Plus size clothes
That was so cool store
I imagine this being the future, it's functional, easier and less hectic since everything is organised and all you need is your phone, but at the same time I still prefer the "normal" shopping experience better
I SUBED pls pls give me the gift card i really need it
Done 👍 I subscribe to
Ok this is really cool and so personalized!
Hi
Hiiiii
hiiiii i love you sooooooooooo much
Why you pulled back your latest video, i just about to watch and ITS gone😂
HOP I LOVE YOU VIDIOWS
hope we want the light dress when are you going to show us
Hi my name is Kaylie
I just got some Ramy brook dresses for cheap! Just sign up for their text messages and you can get 100 off even on sale dresses ❤️  I’ll let ya know how I like them
it scares me that most things about this store rely on technology running smoothly. A simple glitch may loose all options to buy or even lock you in the change room. Just something to keep in mind...
Hope, you're so great at what you do... I have no clue who those other influences are
I love ur hair
okk i
I hate buying clothes....this might actually make me like it! I order almost everything from Amazon anyway! Plus, the dressing rooms look like little hotel rooms! 😆 love it!
Hi bru
Hi hope I love ur content 💜✨🌈🤍🤟
Hii I love watching your videos and seeing all the stuff u do by
Can you do an updated swim wear list!!!! With like outdoor voices, girlfriend collective, some sustainable brands!!!
Hi
My little. Rather care into my room when I was watching you and he said she’s really pretty
Hi Ciskei Georgia that my name
Your videos are always amazing! Thank you for putting in the effort to show us good affordable fashion! :)
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Done
Hi
OMG girl I found your channel like 3-4 days ago and I am going crazy watching your videos lol. Usually I don’t comment but I HAD TO  lol. I loveeee your videos 🥰
I subscribed today and I’ve been watching your videos for almost a week now and there so fun and enjoyable to watch
Hey
I saw your name in Ryan trahan's video, it was nice to see a familiar name ❤️
Hope are you lds? Because I will not support (subscribe) anyone from that church for reasons that I will not publish here.
This HAS to be the future of shopping!  I really hope that all clothes stores copy this concept of clothes shopping going forward! I mean, this way of doing things has to benefit everyone, from what I can see.  I would imagine that the store would make more sales this way, because they add items that they think you might love, plus the fact that you can order more clothes to try on from the dressing room! Amazing! I love this! I usually start off really happy and excited on a shopping trip, but after trying on heaps of clothes that either don’t fit me or I don’t like how they look on me, I start getting a bit grumpy! The last thing I want to do at that stage, is go back out to the store to look for different sizes or new items to try on. So I often get fed up with trying on clothes and just shopping in general and give up trying to find something cute altogether. I often walk away feeling like crap emotionally! This definitely looks like a fun way to shop! Although, I might have a hard time leaving the dressing room, if they let me order more clothes to try on from there!!
Hi
I love your videos
Man I hope I get one of those gifts cards because I am having some stuff going on and I wanted to bye my parents something for there birthday
You should do a review/try on of the new maddie ziegler collection w/ fabletics!
I love that you show what leggings are sheer, it helped me pick out active wear.
I feel like she should make her own products
Done
YouTube just unsubscribed me from you :(
This is so cool!!
Heyyy I love your videos
Thanks for making my day amazing
I love watching Hope's videos
Hi
This seems so fun
I love your videos so much
I LOVE YOU HOPE! Love the vids! I can’t WAIT 2 more days for a new vid! Your am amazing keep up the great work!!
Hi
Wasup

Done
Please do a oh polly haul !!!
Ugh I have on notifications and I never get notified I don’t know if it’s the app or my service but ugh 😑. This is cool but I don’t think I would shop here I like just regular shopping lol it’s a waste of phone battery for me!
Hello
Please shop at Moriah elzibeths shoppp
Hi
How do returns work? May you send them back, or do you have to return them at the store?
hiiii <3 <3 from south africa
now i want all stores to become like this it’s amazing and futuristic
The problem is I live in the other side of the world so most lives are ate 1 to 5 am
❤️my fav YouTubeerrr
hi i love ur vids ur the best
I love your video s hope😍
I love your videos
Hi hope! I just want to let you know that you are an amazing person! You never fail to cheer me up when i am sad!
I love the concept tho...good job amazon
i love your vids your so kind and funny, but the place is whoa!
I love ur vids <3
~
I LOVE THE MAGIC CLOSET. 🎩 ✨️  a HOWEVER though... I really hope they vet people's criminal backgrounds that have access to these dressing rooms with people locked inside. I could see predators trying to take advantage of naked people locked inside of a secluded room with no cameras...
I think the quiz when you're just walking in the door would do better at determining someone's style by scanning a picture of your current outfit & matching items from there as well as the  data from the quiz & past purchases.
So cool but i like the app more
why is this G D SHT promoted and mine is never. Stick it to the YT man and flash mob me chunnel. It's only taken my blacklisted chunnel 12 friggin years to get up to 666 subscribers.
What happened to the 2 light blue dresses you tried on? You looked amazing in them!
that seems like a store that i would go to
Hey
Heyyyyy! I love your videos so much :)
PLEASE REVIEW SIENNA SWIM!! She’s problematic as fuck but I wanna see if her brand pulls through or not!!!
I love it I might visit
Love your videos!!
It's kinda hypocritical to criticize fast fashion companies while supporting Amazon. Like Amazon is a competition killer and destroys small businesses and constantly is in trouble for unsafe labor practices for their workers. Like Bezos does not need my money.
What if your phone dies lol
CAN I PLZZ HAVE ONE OF THE $100 GIFT CARD!!!
Hope you are so amazing! I really do hope to meet you someday because I live in sandy Utah too!
This is a no for me. This store is for young people who have time to shop and no kids following them around. I gave up dressing rooms when I had kids. 🤣 Now there is just no way I am spending this much time in a store. I will just continue to shop online and have it delivered to my door...
❤️🔥
Love how clean it looks can’t wait to go
Every fiber of my being hates this. I hate shopping on my phone and the literal last thing I want to do is drive to a store so I can SHOP. ON. MY. PHONE. I also rarely try clothes on when I go shopping, so this is even more ridiculous and pointless. Having said that.... you are stinking cute and I love watching your videos.
Love your vids so much
I love your video’s
As someone who works in apparel clothing, I would love it if my store had this! Such a good idea.
Hey Hope quick question did Micarah Tewers ever respond about the fiberoptic dress?
I love your vids
Hi ❤ ur vid; I can't believe we have the same last name 💖
You or awesome
I'm surprised that your allowed to film in there and there is not thousands of people
What size did you get in the leggings?
what about disabled people? Blind people??
I love you!!!😄😍
Hi
I have the shoes the white shoes I meant but are pink and kids size
I want to go so bad
I love your vids your one of my favorite YouTubers

Sorry but there is no way the factory workers make a livable wage. thats why i make thrifting videos to encourage affordable ethical shopping

Love 💗
This feels very futuristic, love it
Hi
I hope i win
Such great videos, always looking forward to the next one!
Omg the last rainbow dress 😍😍😍
Watching Hope get so excited over the little things makes me smile every time. Love your content and your sunshine personality!
Hi
Next you should try zyia
Hola
I completely get you with the jeans, I’m 5’1” but I always have to roll the bottom of my jeans up cause no matter what they are always really long. The fit is another story 😂 the calves fit just right (skinny jeans) but from my knees to my waist are baggy, or there’s times when they fit my legs perfectly (except length) but the waist is way small 🙄
This store looks amazing. I have such a hard time finding things instore and online that fit me and look good on me. Who ever came up with the idea of this store is amazing! It definitely helps you find more things to wear that you like and that fit! It also helps a lot being able to see what the outfit looks like on you before buying it. Hopefully over time they will fix some of the bugs in the system and make the store and other stores even better!
Hi
Hi
Hope try boxy charm plsss
The idea of this is so cute!
Can you give me a gift card because when you posted this it was my 10th birthday
Do they have plus sizes?
I would probably like shopping way more if I had something like this bear me. But nope. I'm a buy it, take it home, and return it kinda gal.
This was so good ❤️
Omg I need to go there
I love you hope
Hiii
This is the future of shopping omg so high tech
Please rate VENUS. I love their clothes even though they are a bathing suit online store. Love your channel Ive been binge watching 😂💕
Heyy
What is this world coming to. That's why people are less likely to have conversations. The new generation has no life skills customer service is out the door. Well this is how we know ends of times are coming closer.
I loved the Outfits there absolutely Stunning!!
Hi hope, I've binge watched a shit ton of your videos & now im subscribed, you owe me that $100 gift gard lol k thanks, bye. 🤪
the clothes were cute but just like most stores in the country were geared towards slim women
this looks absolutely incredible and i hope they open more!!!
WAIT UR ALMOST 30 u look like ur in ur teens ur sooooo pretty
Hey
Love this
This is cool, hope it comes to my city of Detroit, but we are getting a Savage X Fenty Store. I feel like it’s something I’d do once for experience and never again.
I wanna go but I love no where near California 😩
i can't belive they made a amozon store to go inside.
Hii
Meow love your vids
Hello
I been calling them leggings ings😂
Hii make more videos
I did it
Helloooo
heh
hi love your vids❤
Done
Hi
Wow
Hi
That magic new size closet is everything!!!!!
How fun!! Planning on going a few weeks since it's kind of close by!
The reason this is amazing is because when I shop I have to have a friend or family member to run and get the same item in a different size for me and this feels private and like I can shop by myself instead of asking employees who ask how it’s going lol
Hello
I wish They had a store like that near me
I did all the the stuff but my comment got deleted but I did it on time
hey, I love your videos and hope I win because I love you an di am I fan if I don't answer it's because I have opened my computer, or it went dead
DONE
So much fun
Love from India ♥️
This is my favorite video ever. Now I just need to go to Cali.
I love her videos, and she is so awsome and funny!
I love love love this concept!
So easy to love and hate Amazon at the same time. I wonder if this concept will make it out of California.
I like the rainbow dress and the jeans. It looked like a great experience
Hope What kind of panty liners for camel toe do you use. Or does anyone else out there no thank you
I feel like the give-aways aren't inclusive to everyone subscribed and are only targeted to select countries in the Northern hemisphere. Some select countries in the southern hemisphere, like where I am from, miss out on participating as it the dead of the night when the videos are posted, like between midnight and 3am. Wish they were more inclusive to all countries than "comment within the first 30 minutes of the video being posted"  Food for thought to be more inclusive of your viewers perhaps.
great finds 🙂
I'm 2 Days Late, Lol. ~ 1 Amor

I think they just need more time to improve this, but it’s a neat concept!
First time coming across your YT … you’re AH-MAY-ZING! 👏🏼 🤍 🛒
I really need the Amazon gift card because I've been struggling in school a lot and I really need it thank you so much if you give it to me I have just no words if you give it to me I just really need that card

Hi! I love your videos so much.
This makes me wish I still lived in CA so I could go there
I love your video .I learned a lot about shopping for athletic wear
Hi
This is the most magical thing I’ve ever seen!
this is so interesting!! I have an amazon warehouse near my house so I wonder if one of these will be built here soon!
Personally the clothes there are aren't my style. That said I wouldn't be opposed to having more stores apply this concept for shopping.
I love your videos
I love your video
Love you videos they are so entertaining!!!!! My fav videos are the lost luggage!! Ty for making videos!!!! 💙
This actually looks awful. I hate being on my phone while I'm shopping
This seems like so much fun 🤩
Hiiiii
Love all your videos so much especially the hauls😜
it’s scary
Girly, I can’t tell you how much laughter and joy your videos have given me and we just really appreciate you so much. ❤️❤️❤️
Omg this is so awesome 🤩 very cool 😎
looks like a really fun😆
Now I know what I’m doing on my next day off 😃
I love your videos
That looks like a super fun experience!
Jesus she picked out were kind of cute
You are too cute! I loved that sunset dress! also, that blue one. wasn't sure about it on the hanger, but way cute!
Hello
She reminds me of jade from victorious (  Elizabeth Gilles ) when she was younger  (2010)
I think it’s a cool concept I hope they bring one to my state. P.S. I always seem to like things that look eerily similar to what I already own 🤣😘
I need jeans
Hello ! You wouldn't be able to post the link to the blue ruffl-y dress you tried on? Thanks so  much if you can !
So cool! I wish I was in LA.
Hi hope I love your videos!
why does this remind me of barbie’s closet😭💀
Love
That would be a cool shopping experience.
Hello
Hiiii
(:
That looks like fun.
But I live in IOWA!! We don't get cool stuff like this!!! I need a gift card AND I turn 40 on the 14th!! I need a cool new wardrobe!! I swear if I ever become a designer ALL  of my launched are happening in Des Moines!! I will make all the cool ppl come to me and enjoy my favorite place in the world. home.
Amazon said Nah 😂😂😂
I was wondering if you've thought of doing a review for LulaRoe?
What part of California is it
🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙂🙂🙂🙃🙂🙃😀
you need to buy amazon fake nails and rate them!
Hii
hi ur so cute
Hi love your videos
This is too cool where is this located? Are there more than one?
I wanna go to the store with you next time !!!!! Fun fun.
can you try out just kass
I’m here late-boo
this is so unbelievably dystopian that i almost can't believe it's real. like yeah let's allow a supercorporation owned by one of the richest people on the entire planet invade our privacy and hyperpersonalize our data even more than they already do so they can continue to beam advertisements into every facet of our lives.
Hi
I LOVED the jeans and very ADORABLE sweater you tired on!!! That looked AMAZING on you!!!  Can’t wait till you post next week!
HELLO. BYE.
HELLO. BYE.
OH FUTURE YASSSS
hi
hiii
This would be the best thing for me I’m horrible at returning things if they don’t fit i Normally just give it to friends… I need one in Seattle
Hi hope^^
Hiii
Cute shoes!
❤️ Your videos!
That place looks so cool
chooochoo train "first 30mins"😂😂
love the video
🤔🤔🤔 IDK ??? CUZ,  THOSE ITEMS SCANNED OR BROUGHT LEADS TO MORE E~MAILS & SOLICITATIONS, SOMETHIN' I MOS DEF I NOT WANT !!!
I have been dying to try this!
So this video is 2 days old, but I just got the notification now. YouTube is such a rascal.
Hope you are the best youtuber
Done
ur videos are my favorite to watch….
I wish I can go to that store it looks so cool
I love that you don't have to talk to a sales person at all. As someone who has social anxiety, this is a dream come true!!! Best thing since ordering online imo
I feel like this store is also nice for its employees also, they are in charge of keeping things organized in a back whereas normal stores people tend to place random clothes in different spots. Love this!
Omg I can’t believe you were in cali I just moved here
I loved the dark blue I think they were jeans or leggings on you they looked awesome I love the sunset dress I really want to go to the amazon store
Helloo!
Imagine going shopping and your phone dies lol
Hey
D
I love your videos! Leo is soooo adorable! but, Amazon is amazing!
Yayyyyyyy
Hey
Hi
This  video is bom
I love you.
Amazon doesn't even know why they are missing !! Give Hope a collab 😜
I love your videos. They are always so fun.
Where in California
Love the video so fun and really good prices     Hope they get an Amazon store in Florida 🌺
Please 100 dollars gift card
Love you love Amazon
Hi
i love your vids so much and would be blessed to even get a message from you!!!🥰🥰🥰
Love  your video I really wanna visit The Stor
Really cool concept
Is this at City Creek??
i legitimate thought leo wasnt gonna be there in the ending n dunno why but i was soooo sad but he showed up  so😁
Love this store, too bad they don’t have one in my state😢
I want to winn
When that thing fell of the jens she put the qr code on the wrong pair!!
I love this!  Great video.  I would go there in a heartbeat. Great for trying on jeans. Also for people with anxiety.
I AM LATE
y'all hold the fuck up-  Hope didn't say she wants to pass kim kardashian in subscribers for the first time ever WHAT-
Seems like waaaay too much work. I’ll pass.
hello
You passed Kim Kardashian !!!!!!!
😀😃😄😁😆
So cool
the fact that you referenced PHIL OF THE FUTURE in this video😍 my absolute fave disney channel show that never got enough credit lol
Cool!
Hi hope
Can you buy gowns from the Philippines (elle gowns) that would be $20-$40 dollars
I have to go just for this experience! The Americana seems like an odd choice for the store, though? The rainbow dress is adorable.
thank you for sharing the experience.. had fun watching the video
Fuck Amazon
I’m subscribed 🥰
So cool
💖💖💖
Heyyy
This seems like I really cool shopping experience? The purple dress I think would look good on you
I could see myself showing up to a store like this with a dead phone.
Day 1 of asking for hopescope to do a aerie review
Yo
I love your videos i subscribed and liked AND turned on the notifications lol
Hi
👍😊
Maybe you have already thought about this, but any clothing that is to messed up to wear, donate to a shelter because some may be able to use the material to make other clothes and ect.  My grandma would be crying at all the wasted material.
I’m not sure I could get into this. I like finding a size, holding it up to decide if it might fit.
😃💜it!
Love! This was fun video. Hope could you please link the dress that you tried on (6:53 frame of the video) would love to buy it. 🤗 thank you in advance 🥰
I refuse to give money to Amazon. Anyone who treats their employees like shit does not deserve my money
Hi I love ur videos
Love it!  So fun!
I hope they make an outfit with you!!
❤️
Thanks so much for always making great vids!
This is soo cool 😻
Hii
I don’t think I saw your beautiful dog….  I love your dog. He’s so stinking CUTE. ❤️ I’m definitely dragging my daughter to this store next time I’m in LA. I’m in a wheelchair w/oxygen and I get SO stressed out in dressing rooms that I haven’t been in one in about 5 years. I think I could go into a store like that. I love that they only have 1 of each item on display…makes it easier for me to get around (I hope). It will be nice to be able to get clothes that fit. Cheers to you and yours.  ✌️❤️
U love the outfit u got so pretty
love u hope! ❤️
ok i loved mr.beast the most at first but now YOURE MY FAV YOUTUBER. Great content girl!!
Hey Hope,  Love your channel and content but was curious, you seem to hate shein and fashion nova for copying styles and designs but Amazon also does that. They are known for using analytics from sells on their platform and then manufacturing a similar piece and putting the vendor out of business. Isn’t that as bad?
Hope, even thought I am sure i am not one of the 30 people to get the amazon card. I just have to tell you that...." You know that you have a sistah bootah" Women are paying thousands of dollars to have your exact butt. Looking gorgeous Queen. 🥰😇😍
I hope that these open up all over the US. I'm excited.
I love this!!!! I wonder where is this store is ??
ok hopefully
I want to go there!!!
I work for amazon and never heard of this. so cool and innovative. ill have to check it out next time im in Glendale.
Well, maybe this was a good idea in their minds but amazon just couldn´t really make it real.
I love watching this ❤️😊
FINNALY SHE HADNT MADE A VID IN TWO WEEKSSSSSSSS
6:53 that looked awsm on you wish you have bought this
that dressing room looks like heaven
Hie hope. I love your videos and your channel. I am pretty sure i have watched all your videos till now even though i found your channel just recently. Your content is awesome but i just want to say one thing that your concept of race for coupon winning is very difficult for international subscribers. We literally have a 12 hour difference and i could never watch your videos as soon as you post them, so, i dont stand a chance to win these prizes ever. Could you please do some other method of giving coupons sometimes ? That way may be i would win something! ♥️
Hi
Might just book a flight from South Africa to see this store😩😍
Hi
Love this! Thank you for sharing!!
Done
Why are Amazon so unprofessional. It’s better to ignore mail then write «Nah.» in response.
Sponsored by even though its not sponsored by amazon
It seems so fun but a little complicated
hey I love your stuff
‼️PLEASE MAKE LONGER VIDEOS‼️ because I’m too obsessed and I would watch hour long videos every time you upload I swear! 💖
Crcfvf
😍
I have notifications on but I never get notifications from you??  I miss out on your giveaways. Why..  ? U mad at me?? Lol
Oh, I love every part of this video!!  Such a fun shopping!! and pls that magic closet😍!!
Just curious, did they have plus sized selections at the store?
Next generation shopping
OMG i loveeeee your vids! I am late but yeah lol
Dude put some stuff on them shelves!!!
Hi
Can you please do an updated affordable leggings for 2022. 😁
How exciting is this 👍
Yesss
Did it
Gotta try this too
We need somthing cool like this in Melbourne cos i dont know of any lol love the ombre dress you looked beautiful 💙💜
Heyy thank you for the videos
hi
I love your hair!!💗💕💖🌸
Not a bad idea for amazon
welp... i tried
Hmmmm, looks like my ideal shopping experience!  Fun!
aw man! I saw this video EXACTLY when it posted yesterday and put it up in a tab to watch when I had free time.  I am studying for board exams (I am in medical school) and I am just now getting to it... 11:30 pm the NEXT day LOL.   Missed the dang give away, but enjoyed the video nonetheless <3 :)
I totally agree with all your comments regarding jeans. Loved that cropped gray sweatshirt you showed from the dressing room.
Hii
Amazon kills neighborhood economy, boycott Amazon
Interesting, I'm eager to see how successful this venture turns out to be.
This must be amazing for anyone who gets anxiety in store. The option to get another size without someone knowhing what you look like has to be great.
hallo
I like all your you tube videos. I would love to see some plus sizes. 💯
Hi I Love  your videos🥰👗👜👡👙
HI! I love your vids, there so entertaining!  Keep up the good work<3
Hey
Love this vid! Keep up the good work <3
Amazing. Also, does anyone know what tanner she uses?
Your our favorite channel 😍 your really honest about how things fit and the quality of what you review!!
Of hope were to do an outfit it would be all active wear stuff 😀
I am also going to . Beach vacation lol😂😂
♡
Love your videos
I love how they let you scan everything you want to try on🥰🥰🥰😍
HEYY

Hi hope
That store is a dream! I can’t wait to visit one! 🛍
Everything looks amazing on you. Thank you for sharing.
You have such a fun personality. I love watching you on utube. I also love amazon shopping. As a wheelchair using person its a lot easier then trying to get through store isles. Keep making your cute and funny video's.
I love your hair
This could make me love shopping for clothes in store again. I think Rebecca Minkoff  has something similar in New York.
Just to get people to use the qr codes there introducing them for the future credit score system like China has 🤷‍♀️ just so you know get ready go against them you starve just like people in China
This is soooo close to my place lol
I wish I lived near the new store. Please pick me as a winner!
I can't wait until they open a store near me!
WOW!!!    :)
I love your videos you bring me so much happiness you put a smile to Eveyones face
Hey
Omg yay
I love that BB Dakota rainbow dress but it's $63 way over this single moms shopping budget 😩😩
So much fun you’re having!
WOAH YOUR HAIR IS SO COOL
bell on cause i was late
I love you vid they are so enjoyable
I didn't even know Amazon had a store! I loved this video and need to visit this store sometime
I’m subbed
That store is REALLY accessible! I would love to not have to carry the clothes in and out of the dressing room. As someone who is disabled - this store seems really helpful.❤️
DONE
yesss!
This seems really similar to Reformation fitting rooms!! (at least the one in Boston) So cool!
future of shopping
such a cool experience omg ! hope it'll come to the uk <3
hey <3
I would be sad to see clothes that are not my size lol. Fun watching u
I am very curious if they have enough plus size options though :/
i had my notifications on wth ‘ i’m so MAD ‘ i would have flown with you
You get your clothes in one minute think of all the employees working like dogs to get your stuff to you quickly. Amazon are notorious for putting unrealistic time constraints on their workers
Omg hope ur so awesome for donating to the fundraiser run by Ryan trahan
The store looks fun but also a little annoying I am not the biggest electronic person and if I have to do all that electronic while shopping is going to get on my nerves I like to just be able to see the item feel the item feel the stretch in the item feel how the fabric feels and sometimes when the size get bigger the fabric change now I know we can fill it when we Tryon and don't get me wrong I think the ideal is great but it might not be great for everyone
This store seems awesome I need to find the jeans also
So cool & futuristic! Will have to checkout next time I’m in LA!
Is there anyone alive that doesn't want to go here?!?! This is amazing!!
imagine if your phone died while in the dressing rooms 😭 or anywhere
nooo im a day late!! im so sad. I never miss a video and I never win the giveaways 😢. Buttt I absolutely LOVE your videos and love you Hope! your videos are the ones I look forward to seeing every week☺
wow. I'm sorta sad. wish one was close.
Omg i have to shop thereee
It sounds like a very cool idea for store and the clothes look nice but are the clothes actually sustainable or is it just more fast fashion with a gimmicky shopping experience?
Hi
Just saying I got that neon green cute cardigan jacket thing on Amazon and now We can TWIN 💚💚
Those pants look fab on you!!!!
Omg ur outfit is sooo cute love the pinks!! 💕 😮
I work at Amazon Air🥰
This was made yesterday on 10/6/22 but I I watched this video about 10 times now and I loved it
Wow, incredible shopping experience!
Love you
girlie!!! sienna swim is now a thing. Would love a review ❤️😉
yo this is so cool
Hi
Dear dear hope , YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFULLLLLLLL
done but i'm too late 'tear'
Ahhh so fun!!
Hi I love you
love you
Once I got a pair of old navy yoga leggings for three dollars on clearance!!!!
I’m ready
This store looks futuristic but i feel like i would like to see the items before I go try them on in my size
Your fit in the into is 😍😍
Fun,,I'd like to win for my daughter ♥️
I have been watching you for super long! And I love you videos! You help me find out lots of things and I love watching you!
this is such a cool thing to experience, i really wanna go here now
I like the dressing rooms it a good safe way for people not to walk in on you
I would not like this store at all.
What a fun concept!
Great Idea
Is Amazon just piloting this in Cali? Will this eventually come to other states/ cities?
So awesome. I hope more stores do this!
This is great for when you're in the changing room by yourself and need a different size, no more standing half dressed with your head popped out behind the curtain looking for an assistant cos you don't want to leave your stuff unattended.
So like what happens if your phone dies?
Ur only an og if u remember when she first got Leo
WAY TO MUCH TO DO.... Just go to the store...and figure it out yourself... WITHOUT using a phone or tech🙄🙄
Hi
Who was that influencer that had the sunset dress you chose?
That looked so cool
Hi
Please pick me. 🙏
It may seem like a good idea, but as you saw it has it's issues.
You are so nice you have time to post  for us
I hope they open all over the world but I'm kinda mad at them for totally ignoring you
hey hope i love your videos
This makes me want to shop… Love your videos!!
Pls send me your one I have to at her all of my our vids
Hi
Many companies are closing stores but Amazon is opening them. It's definitely a very cool concept. I get the limit to 10 items as it keeps people from hogging the dressing room but it sucks that youd likely have to wait a few times to try on clothes.
I love your HAIR OMG 🥰
TJ Maxx should take notes on these dressing rooms.
🥰
Oh no I didn’t get my notifications
Look like such a great and immersal experience ! Take for for taking us with you ! Now I just need one near my home too !
This looks like such a fun new way to try to shop, maybe not everywhere but exclusively it’s a super cool idea!!
I think this is an amazing idea because a lot of the clothes I’ve bought on Amazon were Chinese crap. But where I live we never even had a forever 21, our closest Target is 2.5 hours away so I highly doubt that they will open one of these close to me 😭
I don't buy jeans anymore right now that I can sew  my own and know it will fit
That did you used to be a forever 21And that's kind of funny Now you can buy stuff that used to be sold it forever 21 from an amazon store LOL
Hi I love your vids
SOOO FUN
Wish they were in DC
Hi
This was cooooool!
Love your videos 💞😍 and please choose me for receiving the Amazon card 🙏🙏 for buying my BF a nice gift for his birthday 🎂
this is the dumbest idea ever.  youu can shop online and never leave your house.  so...
how cool is this????
Where is some amazons stores? It looks so cool
Omg i wish we had it
Hi
:)
Loved everything except the last dress which you liked so much😂😂😂 but that is how different people are Would love to have that store everywhere in the world It is definitely the future of shopping
I love the idea of a store like this.... although there are clearly some flaws.
Meow
The dressing rooms remind me of Reformation
That cool
This is amazing 😻
yyhhuhuj
None of that is cheap...
Done I'm not doing this for the gift card I just really like your videos ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
It's wise to invest your money into great deals rather than buying expensive clothes though when it comes to background you can sometimes make silly choices 😜
you should buy the First 5 Things TikTok ads recommended!!!
you should buy the First 5 Things TikTok ads recommended!!!
Let me win pls
I love this video hope your so entertaining
i wonder how many plus size options they have
Do they offer wifi cause that a lot of data use to shop... Just saying...😉
Where is the store located?
Hiiii love your vids they are AMAZIIINNG
To bad that Amazon is bad for small businesses but I get it
Is there a link to the blue dress? It’s at 6:53 on the video.
I’m a new sub thankyou hope!
done
Not being able to try on their clothes is one reason why I don't buy clothes
everything looks good on you🥰🥰
Very cool 😎
Love this vid ! Now I want to go to this store lol
Hope. You HAVE to redact to your old videos. Not just the super old ones but also the ones that are like 1, 2, or even 3 years old. You should react to one from every year you’ve been doing YouTube. So 1 from 3 years ago 1 from 2 years ago ind so on.
⚠️SPAM⚠️ HOPESCOPE WE SAW U IN NUMBER 43 (THE LAST DONATER) IN RYAN TRAHAN'S FUNDRAISER VID DAY 12#!
WOW that was so cool. Thanks Hope
I love shopping on Amazon things are so cheap
Love these❤
This was awesome that we got to see it by you.  Thanks!  2nd pair of jeans looked awesome.
Bye Leo.  I hated that beige dress but then you added the sandals....I love it now.
This is nice
I wish they had that where I lived.
hi
I love that you do these giveaways without making people follow 17 different pages, like a bunch of videos, and tag 12 friends. You're a lot more generous than most other youtubers
I am done
Hi babe! Your the best
THATS SO COOL. IM ON AMAZON WEBSITE
Your videos always make my day ❤
Loved this one!!!
I hope I get amozon card I’m a huge fan and have been watching for a while
I am Maine I really hope that I get the gift card
Cheese
Dang ☹️I'm a day late
Hi
I love the last dress.
so great videos ❤, only sad thing is that most of the stored that you shop are unavailable from europe (Estonia)
Love love love!!!
Was there a limit to how many, items you could try on at once?
I would give my left foot to win .....🤞🏼😏🥰 I'll settle for this new video , still a win . Love this
Jeff Bezos is trying to take over all marketing spaces it appears!
Hi i want onew
Omg you didnt buy the blue one??? 😓😓😓
Imagine shopping here and then your phone dies😭
Love your videos.  Your always fun and informative on the new trends.
Gutted I didn't get my notification.
My favourite thing about the store is the dressing rooms, they're so... modern
hii
I did it
This is so cool! I hope they make more of these stores!
I LOVE U AND UR VIDS SO MUCH U INSPIRE TO BECIOME LIKE U!
Finally a store that my arm won't die in from carrying so much stuff. 😂

I love your channel it is so interesting
I'm an older woman that I love watching your videos with such an inspiration and my twenty-year-old love watching you with me keep up the amazing work
I sit for hours  watching  and re watching  your videos.

😊

👋 hi❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEO'S LOVE FROM INDIA
She said the best affordable leggings, but didn’t tell us which leggings.
Interesting shopping concept. I don’t think it is for me though. I am too old school, but, will like to give this shopping experience a try. Thank you for sharing.
We have a local Amazon.
Done
late but still cool experiment seeing you do it
Hi
i would already struggle cuz my body is so weird that i need to try differend sizes right away, or also to see them at the rag how they actually are.
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Hello
Love you!!!!!❤️🥹
Omg so futuristic
hi
Pick meeeee 💕💕💕💕💕💕
I’m done
Wish we had one here upstate New York
Love you hope
Amazon stole this from reformation
Yesssss Hope! Are you able to add to your Amazon shopping page from the store? A couple of those sweater you had on were super cute. Amazon can we get this is Canada pls!!
Hi
The fact that Amazon is monopolizing brick and mortar after ruining the relevancy of in person shopping is abhorrent.
hi
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
I love the concept of the shop. Sadly I live in Switzerland🥲 But I love your videos
Hii🙂
I would actually physically shop in store if more places moved to this model. Genius idea.
I love your hair  my goodness  So cute  :)
Omg your such an inspiration
I would go shopping more if more stores had this system
Can you link the light blue dress please!! 🥰💙
Enjoy watching the vidios 👸
pick me. luv ur videos by the way💖
Hello
This is really cool
I Love this video a lot 😝💅
It does look very high-end & very clean looking. That liac dress looked beautiful on you actually all the items looked beautiful on you 😍 wish that store would come to the UK 🇬🇧
I would shop here everyday
Ur so good!
Oh well well  solong taim
I think this would make me crazy..I’m a little OCD and love picking off racks!
This is so amazing I am checking it out like today even though I am in Turkey totally away from California
I really like the store I will come right now I am in Turkey so I’m currently booking a flight to California
this is so cool, I'm like you I get so uncomfortable in dressing rooms and it's probably the only time I experience social anxiety so having forever 21 replaced by this would not be the worst thing in the world......  also RUDE they would be HONOURED to have outfits put together by you
Hi
I loved that cropped jacket you tried on!! It was Super Cute!!
Hiii
❤️❤️❤️
Hi
Damn on the Amazon card!!! It's okay! I watch and like your videos anyway!!! 💕
I just wanna say that amazon is got some good stuff
Love the video
Hiiiii
Done...liked comment and subscribed
Hi! I love your videos! Thank you for posting videos x
I love watching all of your vid they are so entertaining 🥰
I love this idea on shopping
Thank you 😌
Hi You amazing
I did everything
Just can't help but think about all the unethical practices for all the fast fashion
Hmm Not bad  But I don’t think I will go there anyways
Great! Thank you for your videos! Lots of love from Italy❤️ ❤️ ❤️
hello
Nice
Jo
Hi
This is so cool — it’s kinda scary hahaha
I love it! I get kind of stressed in rl stores now.. after shopping online for so long.
What the heck! I love your videos💙
Please kylie do blogs on YouTube
Late:(
That is the coolest store ever
Done pls give me the 100
Loveee love your videooo❤️
Wow I didn't even know this store existed! That pink dress! Girllll you look beautiful! Plus Your butt looks amazing in those leggings! Pick me so I can get those black leggings too!
done
It's funny how you went on a plane just to get to a Amazon shop
Hi
TRENDINGGG
Hope i love you been here for so long almost a year after you started i love you i remember your old house ahh just love you and your co host leo. you are the best. Just love you so much its hard not to just come to the usa to you but i live in Sweden 🇸🇪 just love you
So it's a Nordstrom's rack?
I love Amazon!
I wonder if she made the little diagrams of the store! She’s so talented!
It’s weird that the QR code can pull up your individual Amazon account!
Fun!
Omggg I’ve been wanting to order from Amazon from America to buy things they don’t have on Amazon in my country but the shipping cost was as much as the item, so I’d love to win the 100 gift card so I just have to pay the price once and not double for the shipping cost!!!!💕💕💕
Omg the tops you wore in your intro, where are they from? 🥺 I lovedddd this videooo💕💕💕
🔥
You’re so kool !!! I watched this twice
Here✋
I’m guessing you guys moved? I’ve noticed new background in your newer videos so I’m just assuming. Love you and your videos. Would love to see another Amazon returns pallet.
Girl everything other than the atheleisure wear is a noooo
I really like this concept, only a 6 hour drive for me to experience
That store is pretty cool!!!!
Best apparel shopping experience you can have!! I HATE the pressure of sales people walking around and asking me if I need help etc. Leave me alone! This entire concept is incredible! I really hope it catches on.
HEY!! can you do a nobull clothes review, would love to see a review on the leggings and on the sport bras! Love your vids!
rvrreeee
hiiii
Love the shopping experience yet not the lack of support of you, a kind YT’er.  You think Jeff Bezos, the multi billionaire could afford to sponsor you!  I guess they need to fix the flaws yet like the ideas behind the shopping experience.  Maybe that’s why they didn’t want you to film it, lol.  Thank you Hope for showing us the interesting shopping experience!
i love youre videos
LOLOLOLOLOL AAAAAAA
Omgosh I need to shop there!! I love that nobody bugs you!! Perfect for me!!
This is why I buy basically everything on Amazon it’s so much better than other stores 😫
The room being ready before me would make me feel so rushed though!
30 m im a bit late but its mybirt day
so interesting! i didn’t know they had stores now
Sorry late to comment because l live in India and when you posted this video it was 3Am in India sorry love your videos really want the Amazon gift card cause  💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 Today is my birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I am turning 12 💕💕☺️
This was a fun vidio
Great video
Hi❤️ <3
love your videos
Thank you for sharing this experience and giving so much detail.  I am definitely going to discuss this in my retail management class in the fall.  Love your content!!!❤️
Done
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
I just wanted to say watching your videos makes my daughters & I laugh. We recently adopted two girls and it can be awkward at first but it makes us laugh and starts a convo. My oldest said “mom I think she has a legging addiction issue” lol.
15 hrs late. But I still want to like &comment ❤️
im a fan of simply looking around stores and this store does seem preety fun!!
Sooo cool
14
I have never had you  send me any thing ,My be hours later
You know what….I made it through over 300 videos (in two months) to finally get to a video published within 14 hours. If you’d answer your Insta I’d consider that just as much of a win as the timing of this video! Woot! Thanks lady!
I love your video it makes my day
I went today after watching this video.  In case anyone is curious, it’s exactly what hope said it was. It was SUPER fun, very clean, introvert friendly shopping. Plenty of sales people on the floor to ask questions if you needed to. Friendly service with a smile.   I did two size changes in the dressing room and it took them less than 3 mins both times to deliver the new one. Keep in mind this is like 6 pm on a Saturday. The Americana is crowded on weekends!!  I’d go again !
I liked
it's so pretty but... why wouldn't it be ready in the store that's why they made it right? they shouldn't been more ready about it... but it's ok I guess
LOL I walked past this store the other day, had no idea it was bringing this concept to life! Should have walked in lol
Hope be trending today!! That's awesome
Fun! I am always a little hesitant to buy clothes on Amazon so this is a great idea.
I LITTERALY love this whole video. your content never fails to make me and my mom laugh or have some more reasoning to get stuff from certain places.
the pink dress
i need to take my mom there she would go ballistic!!
That’s is like the best shop
Oooh we are gonna have to go here!! Sooo fun!!
I have trouble with jeans too
That closet and digital closet are futuristic! This may be the shopping of the future.💘
Is there a link to those $26 dollar leggings you showed that are affordable.
AMAZON GIFTy Carddd
Was that a crawfish 🦞 🧐🥴
Love your videos I know I’m late but I had to clean my house today I know that’s not an excuse but I will be ready next time !! 😁
Dose 13 hours count🥺
Love your video
i like dresss
I like your channel. But actually I'm into your videos about outfits of famous films.
wow.  I didn't know this ....
i neeeeed to go here
I wish we had that in wv
Amazon Store looks like the exact vibe and energy level I've been DREAMING OF when it comes to shopping! I'd give anything to try that experience out. I am so jealous of you, Hope, as always!!  Dang, too late to hope for a gift card! 🎁
Subscribed and liked💗

This is SO cool!  Great video.
Hi
Hope I am absolutely IN LOVE that you do videos that no one else does….I didn’t even know about the is magical Amazon store, beyond genius!!! Thank you for bringing us a long☺️ Always love your videos!!!
Really enjoy your videos. It makes me want to get out there and find good deals. It also gives me good ideas.
I love your videos
Wish I had seen the video sooner. Been taking care of a sick little one. That's awesome how that works though. I could have used some new clothes. Lol. I couldn't tell you the last time I even bought clothes. Let's just say it's been a long time. Some people probably won't believe that but it's the truth. Lol. Love your videos.
Very cool concept and you looked great in all that you showed us! I enjoy your enthusiasm and energy on all your videos.
$ 100 amazon gift card 😍
Aww I am late to comment . :(
Not sure how I feel about the whole dressing room time frame.
Yaaaa
Hope, Girl, I live in Buena Park and had no idea about this! I’ll give it some time to work out the kinks but thanks for the awesome experience find! I cannot wait to go!
I love the gray set! Everything looks pretty on you.
Do fun
got out of work and immediately watched this 🤩🤩
Love it❤
That last light blue dress you tried in was stunning on you also, you should still snag that one!
I eaw hoping this was in Utah
"Nah" lmao. Didn't they literally just close many of their brick and mortar stores. I don't think this will last long.
This is insane! So futuristic… yet so now…
I would love to visit that store.
This is my dream shopping experience 😲😲😲😲 omg I want to go!!!
Hey hope scope I really need an Amazon gift card im getting something for my birthday and I really need stuff it would mean the world if I got it

Tyler should’ve done one too I’m curious about the guys stuff
Love this
Lol
Pls
Hope I love you so much you are so beautiful and kind. Keep being you!!!
This is a pretty cool idea. Hopefully they fix the kinks that you pointed out because damn, I want to shop here now.
Have to pass on this, hope narrator picked up a new braw or a top to cover things up. What is this a knock off on Seinfeld?
Dang I was late
Nah 😂
Really cool but obvy still some quirks to work out with the store lol p.s. totes off topic I L O V E your hair the blonde and pink so pretty 😍 💗 ✨️
HEY I LOVE YOUR. VIDSS
That's cool
Being so on-demand in the store makes me worry about how the employees are being treated - it is Amazon 😑
So cool!!!! I want to go to one!!!
I love Amazon
Wow, how did you hear of this?
such a cool concept! hopefully more stores try something similar!
Hi hope I love you ❤  byeeeee

Amazing video!
Looks like fun. Will have to add this to my bucket list. I just love your channel.
Hi
Hiiiii
DANG! 30mins😫😫😫 I think this is a cool idea, but there’s some flaws with the system. That said, I can see more stores do something like this.
In too lateeee
I lbe your vidoes
Hi
Hi
How do returns work though?
I bet it's easier for associates too, I would rather pull it and put it away then have someone dump the item where it doesn't belong
He
Fake that's what I'm getting from you lately.
Hi
HEYYYYY HERE FOR THE GIFTCARD111
I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I got so excited when you said you were giving away Amazon cards, love Amazon. Love this video!
love ur blog subscribed all I wear is leggings lol
😊💕
Sandy is Here
I love love your videos
i love ALL of your videos and this looks soon fun!!!!
I miss what this channel was before you sold out and started doing videos like this 🗑🗑🗑
Is this the way of the future? As someone who's autistic shopping is a nightmare. I love that with this I dont have to interact with people. I never try on clothes because im scared of talking to employees
So it's Ikea, basically....
I love your videos
I hope they open one near me I love this concept
<3 i want to WIN<3
I LOVE YOUR VIDS
i love amazon i what to go shopping there
It seems like a cool idea, but it seems like it has some bugs.
I appreciate you for doing this 💯 but it just seems like too much work. Lol. Thank you for doing this on our/my behalf
Every time a barcode fell I was like damnnnnn 🥲🤣    Where did you get your black dress though?
I’m wondering do they have these in every state available? I never even knew about this!
Love the video :)
Ok, I almost missed your call for the Amazon gift cards. I hope that this qualifies as an entry! A swinging senior from Canada.
Heeeyyy
I am SHOOK over that magic closet that’s amazing
Heyy
New dressing room standard?
I miss laate
Way too much technology
This store is amazing!!!! Where is this store located?
How do we know if we won a gift card?
I want a store like this in our town!! How much fun is this????
Sup, hope keep shinin like the sun 😎 darlin
The need to do this in all of America this is so cool!!!
I’m in Brooklyn NY. Wonder if they have one in the city. Seems like a fun experience!
Wow this is such a neat experience!   Kinda interesting to see a store like Amazon create a brick and mortar store given that they’ve sorta eliminates a lot of those stores with their site!
OMG!!! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH AND THE REVIEWS YOU DO ON CLOTHES HAVE REALLY HELPED! <3💜❤️🤍
Done
this is such a cute video, you are so amazing and fun to watch.
I want to go!!!!!!
This looks amazing! Fantastic way to shop 😁
an introverts dream!
I loved the video
So cool!!! I have all the questions…when you get home and decided you don’t in fact want one of the items, can you return it like a regular Amazon Prime return? Also can you go back and get 10 more items later after trying on the first 10?
Ah man. I got the notification right away, but I had to run errands all day 😢  Great video though ❤️
i love your vidssss so much
What's the name brand of the leggings you purchased? Thx.🙂
That looks so cool. I cannot imagine not carrying my stuff though, I feel like I would immediately forget everything I’d send to the dressing room and end up with like a million things to try on lol. Love your content!!  very big fan, fun videos to watch
What is this sorcery?!?!🤯🤩🤗 I have so many questions! We need another video at this place!!! I wanna see how it all works from behind the scenes. As a physically disabled person with social anxiety; everything about this set up appeals to me and I'd love the company to share ways that they can improve the shopping experience for disabled people. I don't support Amazon, but I do support this model of sales and hope other retailers follow suit. Thanks for sharing,  that was neat 👌
I love your hair in this video! So pretty! 🥰💗
This is so high tech! I need to see this place.
Heyyy omg I’m a fan
I just am obsessed with her hair
Awesome video as usual!
This is really cool!
Great concept from Amazon
I can’t believe you that the Amazon rep replied “ nah “ to your request. That’s so rude!
Love this 💕💕💕
Hi hope!.
I love Amazon it is the best online store. I love watching your videos. You are very entertaining to watch.
Does the younger generation just not like people lol? I work retail and I work at a clothing store and I can’t imagine not having that customer service. I love talking to my customers and meeting some really cool people and then having regulars that I see. I mean this is cool but Not personable. I think when you stray away from talking to humans the more you’re gonna end up with social anxiety because you’re straying away from it
AMAZING 🤩
woohoo! great video Hope!
Done
Why didn't they have the  sensors that automatically check you out like in the Amazon Fresh store?
What?!?
I need to go here
Super cool!
This is such a cool concept!!
Hiiiiii I love you
Me pls
Let’s pretend I commented within 30 minutes 🤣🤣
Also your dog is ADORABLE!!!❤️❤️
I would LOVE this!!
I need to go there now
Awwh man there were a few pieces I loved on you, but you didn’t get them. It’s okay, I forgive you lol
They definitely need to build more and hopefully, they carry jeans and pants that fit long legs.
I would spend too much there,,,
But are they size inclusive?
As someone who used to work in retail, I LOVE THIS. It reduces clean up after hours; prevents customers from messing up display; makes customers feel comfortable in the fitting room; you can fit more inventory on the floor bc you only have it in one size. It should replace all f21s lol.
Those blue dresses look amazing on you!!
omg what an experience!
hi, i really love your videos and i really love your dog
This is an amazing experience
So fun, thank you for taking us on this shopping experience of the future! I can't wait to try it. And I would shop an Amazon x Hope collab!!
Amazing experience!
It's an interesting way to shop
This store seems so cool! At least in theory....
Hi
I love your videos so much! you always put a smile on my face and I hope that you keep making videos forvever
Super clever idea but all of the clothes look so cheap and awful 🥴
Cool store
Hope they open one by me in Chicago. It'll be great to try on items before you buy them. Especially leggings. I've not found my best leggings yet. Thanks!!!👍😊
Ooooh fun
I hope I win a gift card!!!
We need one of these in Australia 🇦🇺  buuut we will see if we ever get one 😂 Love ya Hope ❤️ Love watching your stuff.
good adventure
This looks so fun!! Especially for a person who likes to shop on Amazon a lot. Can’t believe this is a real thing like I would love to go there. If you had a great time there then I will to! By the way love your videos💕❤️
Never tried Amazon sounds like something I should check into
♥♥♥
I love the dressing room. :)
love all your videos and so excited about this amazon store.
Hii!! Love you and your vids im an og! this is my 5th time trying to win a give away! you are so amazing to be doing so many give aways to!!
this is so cool!
I absolutely loathe Amazon and wouldn’t venture into this store, but this is a concept I have wished for for well over a decade. I’m terrible at finding clothes I like so being given recommendations based on something I’ve added to my basket and then have it pop into the changing room is the dream. Not to mention clothing stores overwhelm me with the amount of stock that’s on the floor so I love the idea of a more affordable store only having one size out. But still, it’s Amazon and I don’t particularly like anti-union monopolies that deliberately hire through agencies so they don’t have to give their overworked employees any job security.
pls choose me my mom thinks she knows me until she get my cloths
Wow! Love that dressing room! Both the jeans looked great on you. Thx&see ya😁
I’m only 8 hours late 😬
Omg this is awesome
hi
love ur videos
heyyyyy i love your vids sm
Text me 310-582-5313 ❤️ if you want me to send you updates and reminders when new videos go live! ☺️
Love the pink dress!
:)
:OO I need to go!
Now I wonder if you want to return anything from the store you can do it like you do from the app. Hm something to think about
I want a closet like that … wow loved everything on you . You looked gorgeous as always . I feel like you do in the changing room very stressful an one one item looks bad or a get a negative response it ruins the experience for me
Hi hope I have a a lot of stuff in my Amazon cart you are lucky you got to visit an Amazon store I hope your experience was great 👍
Where’s Leo?
Loved todays video !!
I miss Phil Of The Future
Yass queen ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🖤
Hii
I love these videos love
Hi
I love watching your videos
Love
that. is. cool
I love your channel very much.  You are one of the most authentic YouTubers in existence.  Today, while watching Ryan Trahan's journey across America for .01, I saw your name in the list of people that have donated.  You ROCK Hope!  Thank you for what YOU do and thank you for being YOU!
Shopping in itself is such a fun yet can be a stressful experience. I’d be hyper stressed if I had to use my phone and have the battery die at a time like this. This seems quite the hassle.
Really cool experience
hellllloooooo
Love this vid
Can you use Amazon gift cards there can you return to Amazon to be sent to the store
Great job!
🙄🙄🙄 what if people can't log on RIGHT AWAY lol
Ayyyy that’s right by me! It’s crazy in there haha very futuristic. Loved that they had such a range of prices from $20-400+ lol. Nice employees too!  Also fun fact- the Amazon Style was originally a Forever 21😂
Shopping there is for younger shoppers.  I can turn on a cell phone but would never be able to figure out how to use it at an Amazon store. Good video.
Love your  videos
This is so cool!
I love these videos
It’s not fair when you do a give away because when you go live I can’t participate because I live in Hawaii
Ur so luckyy
Rip…. I’m always late
that is such a cool store, I love your videos thanks for making my days!!!
affordable leggings for 26 dollars!? clearly someone has never been to primark before...
Hi
Like the video
This is so cool! Love the video!
Interesting concept. I doubt the plus size experience would be as positive, though.
Wow! I’m very amazed by this experience. I’ll definitely have to check it out.
hi hope i love your videos i watch all of your videos with my sister and your our favorite youtuber
done
I’m glad the actual shopping experience was good, I feel they were a little unprofessional for the email about you asking to make a video though.
And that was a forever 21 ! Lol
And that was a forever 21 ! Lol
Love!! Amazon shop. We need this!
Omggg you were in my area!! How fun!! I need to check this place out because I hate shopping so this could be a much better experience. Thank you for sharing 😇🙏🏻🫶
I love you❤✌ hope
Hi
I love you
So, were the dressing rooms cool? I get so hot changing clothes. Also, where did you get black dress you're wearing? Xx
Can I get one
Should have a game of seeing who gets the least amount of delivered sizes - wanna bet that plus sized one will lose?
That's creative but not sure
I set an alarm for the drop of this video and then forgot what my alarm was for when it actually went off lol.
Love watching your videos
Hi I love your videos ❤️‍🔥
WTF
I love you
💙
Me too on the anxiety in the dressing room!
Can I just say - I have intense, INTENSE, hair jealousy. It's so gorgeous.
I live in a different time zone but I have been following you for over 4 years. You got my mum on to different stores and she follow you as well
hiiiii
ME PLS 3 MINUTES
Hihi i am from germany
I would really like a Amazon gift card please
Hi!
can you stop smoking weed your eyes are showing it, thats disgusting
I was notified and my YouTube was down!!! 😩😩😩 looks pretty cool though!
Hiiii hope , I love ur vids so much! They make me very happy!😘😘
What???!!! This looks awesome! Such a cool idea! If they could improve on the items available for try on and allow you to create an inspo outfit, it would be perfect, perfect, perfect!🤣  I also get anxiety when trying stuff on... The constant “checking in “ to see how I’m doing makes me feel pressure to buy things that I may not even like. This concept solves that!❤️
skskzk
Interesting
Very cool!!! Always a pleasure to visit you, Hope!:) God Bless!
I need to go to this store!  but are we not gonna talk abt that email reply
im always late
i love ur videos
I showed up super late but thank you for not saying that a part of winning isn’t a part of social. I only YouTube and snap. Don’t have an insta or anything. Just not into it. Leaves people like me a small chance of winning ;)
Beautiful
Love ur videos!!💕
This looks amazing!! 😍 If only there were stores like these in Australia!!!
Love everything except the beige dress (sorry).
Oh man that looks like so much fun!!
all my anxiety goes out the window when i sit and watch your videos! love you hope!
hey!
I do like the idea of a streamlined storefront with all the additional sizing options in the back but the amount of choices in this huge store feels overwhelming. It would be better as a smaller boutique.
Am I late 🫣
ok badassss store much?????
What a fun video! Thanks for sharing the experience ☺️
Omg I need to go heeeeeere!!!
Well I’m late but I was reading 😂😂
That’s cool
Your contest is unfair due to time zone 🕰
im late :(
this is actually so cool!
I'm SUPER into dresses this year (no joke I've bought like 5 in the past 3 weeks!) after HATING them my whole life. I LOVE the last one! The gorgeous colors and girl that looks AMAZING one you!
Haha well notications didn't work 😅 only 6 and a half hours late
My mind 😐 is officially 😳 BLOWN! 🤯
Umm that looks so much fun! And really futuristic!!💗
That's really sad about the jeans lol
Hi

Hiii
with the bash dressthat you want to wear to the beach I recommend maybe something longer because the wind and the beach will blow your dress up I know from experience hhahaha
M late for the gift card
I love your video!!
The store looks so cool. I hate carrying items lol
This store looks amazing
Wow I miss the time frame
im hereeee
Hi this is such a good idea love your vids
Wow, I really liked your shopping experience there! I hate going to places & trying on clothes, I avoid it at all costs, but I think I would actually enjoy shopping there. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us:) xo
Hi
We love you <3
Hey Hope ! You should get kardashians used clothes , and find cheap dupes and compare them !! :)
i can’t imagine every store being like this in the future but it seems fun to try out!
Hi
Yeah but late

Another amazing video....... 😍 Lets see if our shopping experience will change in those coming years.
I wonder if there is a button to press if you get stuck in something lol

IM LATE BUT HI 😨😭😭😭😭
POV: watching this video while living in another country                        nice video i subscribed. If I am chosen for the Amazon gift card I am not sure it will be delivered to my house as I live in Belgium.
Sorry I was late
Hi
Not for me - this store.
Hi I love your videos  😀😃😄😁😆☺️😊
This honestly seems like the future of in store shopping. Very cool, not perfect, needs some improvements. But seeing as this being the first few days it’s open, I can understand that.
This is crazy!
This would honestly be so fun
What a fun video!!! Thank you!!
I think this is actually very cool that Amazon did this! I wanna check it out!

I love this, this is an excellent idea  👏🏽👏🏽Amazon
Hope you're the best!
i hope this store comes to nyc
DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hi
not a fan of not having multiple sizes on the rack... a lot of the time i go by how an item looks size wise...  cuz cant even trust sizes. sometimes i need a 2x sometimes i need a 4x...  sizes are all over the place. i'd end up having to keep getting another size which would be annoying lol.
What happens if you are Buying a gift for someone and you don’t need it in a dressing room?  Looks like so much fun! Thank you for always taking us in your adventures!
Always enjoy your videos! Thanks for taking us on your journey.
how do you look gorgeous  in everything you try on?
love it
I had no Idea! So cool.
Idk
Hi please link the black dress you tried on☺️
I love you hair and your outfit is adorable
I hope that they continue to open more stores. This really looks like fun shopping!!!
It seems like such a fun way to shop!
That is cool I wish I could go there one time
Its crazy how amazon now has a store
The 2 piece periwinkle dress looked so good on you .
I saw you donated to Ryan Trahan's donation fund! That's so cool 😎 so happy to see people support family's in need ❤️
i can't get over that closet 😄
Hope your videos are amazing ❤️
Can you please do Lizzo's new line. 🙏

I had my notifications on for you :( but I was working. Ugh. Lol 😆 I hope more of these Amazon stores come out ! Looks so futuristic

It looks like the people that own the store they just put name tags on and then don’t check
Love this video!
LOVE THIS STORE! CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT OUT.
Hey! I just wanted to say, I Love all your Video’s!!!🤍💜 Love Love Love!! 🤩🤩

Love you hope 🌷😘🌟
How FUN!!! those Joe jeans are SO cute on you! I want! No, I NEED!! 😄Actually…everything you showed us looked amazing on you! So I need to slow my roll bc your waist is much smaller than mine right now. 😂 All around fun video…per usual! 🫶🏼
You are the best youtuber! I've started watching you 3 years ago! Luv u!
Done! Hope I win!
That looks very cool!
I’m a big fan I watched this channel for a very long time
That store sounds like an employee hell hole lol
I would enjoy this, not talking to people or searching for a different size.. but not sure if this would work in every country 🤔
Ah, I wish you purchased those other dresses. They looked soooo good on you!
I love your videos and I wish I could be you
Nooooo!
Really liked this video.  Hope they have one of these stores near me.
Such a cool place 😯👍🏻
I want a store like this around here.
Can't believe you left the blue frilly one behind you looked great in it.
I love your videos so much, I should get this out.
I love you so much
Love this!
would love to go but seems like too much effort for me honestly
Looks so cool!
Those of us without phones are screwed lol
Would love to try out this store!
I wanna go!
That store looks awesome! I hate trying on clothes in public too but this might change my mind
not in store to try on, im dead.  the 300 blue dress was cute though xd  thanks for the tour Hope <3
Hello…..
Done
Hi please pick me I subscribed and liked this is my comment I love your videos but I guess you allready picked
This looks like a dream!!!
i love your vids
Pls?

you started when i was born😁
Done
Is it 30 minutes?
omg i want to go to this store now
I love this
This is the future of shopping omg
Not sure I like this kind of experience.  I like shopping from my couch.
Hi
I’m late but ima show up for the comment anyway 💕
this is honestly so cool. the dressing rooms were definitely my favourite part.
Love ur videos especially shopping and reviews. I love the lost luggage bag store. I want to go thrift there with my friends.
HOLDUP ITS IN LA, IN AMERICANA???I NEED TO GO!!!
Hi
LIKE YOUR VIDEOS I DON'T LIKE THE AMAZON STORE
How cool! I hope they open one in the Mall of America!
That looks too  crazy for words
❤️ 😍 love it
Done
Awesome!
This is such amazing shop, especially for me with social anxiety 😍😍
I like this video. I just wanted to say hi 👋
Loved this one
Dang I was so close
Wow the future of shopping. Love it!
Hi i love ur vids
❤️❤️❤️
This looks AMAZING
Strange processing
This concept isn’t that new reminds me of service merchandise but for clothes. Service merchandise was like a department store but without the clothing it was mostly furniture and knickknacks electronics and a jewelry counter. You would Cary around a pad of paper and write down the number for the item down present that at the register where they basically order your order for you in the  warehouse  and you pay then you wait while warehouse staff pick out your item. Kinda like shopping a catalog in person with almost immediate satisfaction.
I gotta buy some cute stuff for my first ever apartment 😬 help me outtttt
Would have been nirvana
How fun this experience was, love this Amazon video. So cool Those dresses was cute
Love my home town.. and miss it so much!!
Love this store would love to shop there.
Hi
hello I may be a lil late but it worth a try !! keep up the good work!!!
Looks like fun ❤️
Jean are already sold out lol holy cow
Hope is always giving us the best videos- like booking a flight to test out a shop for us!
hi
You’re literally gorgeous
Hi
woww! i wish this kind of futuristic technology existed in my country as well.
I can’t believe Amazon said “nah” 😭💀
I don't know what I think about the store. Seems kinda odd. I don't know if it's because I'm older and more set in my ways of how I shop, or if the system just has lots of bugs that need to be worked out first. I think it's really cool that you showed us how it works though. I'm sure there will be lots and lots of people that really love the concept.
Soooo fun I want to visit this store
I just hope they have phone chargers in store and also if you need to return is it as easy as returning normal amazon things??
This would be my dream shopping experience! They need to open more stores.
Thanks for shopping 🛍 at amazing in la !! That was effort
You are supporting modern slavery
My all 🔔 has been on since I subscribed almost 8 months ago but I never get a notification when your videos go live
Great video hope! This would be great for shopping with anxiety
this is so cool hope to see it soon!
Sounds scary but convenient
Niceeeee store...wow
I only live a few hours away from Burbank- I want to go and see this store!♥️😍
weird how the jeans werent avalible. was someone else trying it on or saved it?
Great video
Wish you're videos to be longer,,, 😬😘
am i the only one how has been cheaking her channel every day and now getting so exited to wacth this vido
😂 Seriously Amazon? Nah. Why is that so fantastic?! Edit: I need the “magic closet” in my home.
Ummmm I would love this so much 😍
But if they have only one piece you risk missing out on nice things if there are people around shopping like you
You look 👀 adorable 🥰 in all of them   Nice choices!🌸🌸🌸🌸🌈🌈🌈🦋🦋🦋🦋😊😊😊🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🍄🍄🍄😀😀😀💎💎💎💎
they need these in the uk tho
I was hoping this would be in Seattle - why is all of the best shopping in LA!!! Thanks for an insight into the Amazon store I was so curious to see the real experience vs the advertised experience. Sending oodles of love
I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND I WANNA TRY GOING THERE
Loved it!
Thats so cool
Noooo I'm too late
Hi
That actually looked like a pretty good idea.
OMG so cool!! I want one of these in Argentina! (I know it never gonna happen though 💔)
Hii
Amazon gift card 😭💕
Do they have shoes?
Serious Black Mirror vibes.
I literally want everything you bought! Pray for my wallet
Love you this store is crazy 😧
Been waiiiiiting for a new vid!!!
I love you and your sense of style
Seems like such a cool experience!
Omg Hope!! This is amazing!! I want to shop here sooo bad! I'm much older but bought most of my clothing from Amazon this season.  I want to go!!!! Love the lime green sweater but found it kinda pricey at $96. I agree with you about jeans, its so hard to find ones that fit well. I have very small hips but big thighs. I just bought a pair of True Religion that fit pretty well but a little snug in the thighs. I was going to have a pair custom made, there are still a few sites that do it, but were afraid I'd measure wrong and they're nonrefundable or exchangeable.  Maybe you can do a video having custom jeans made for you. I know they're kinda pricey but might make for a good video. Ty for this video, I loved it! Btw, I'm a grandma of 10, so when I said I was older, I meant much much much older!! But I still love fashion! ❤
Nice
E Hours Kate but still fab video! X
Beautiful🥰
Hi please me
Great video🔥🔥Wish they had these types of stores in the Caribbean tho
I hope I get the $100 gift card Amazon have a good day!
NOT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's Saturday where I live and I was out all day and I wasn't able to use YouTube and I have a flight in a few hours. It's past midnight here right now and I have to again wake up at 4:00am  for the flight but I still got watch  this video. I probably will download it and watch it later on the flight. Haven't seen the video yet I am damn sure it's good anyways love you hope and I will watch the video later.goodnight💓💓💓💓😊😊😊   Edit: I am not lying about my situation right now I really am going through this but still love you hopescope,tyler and LEOOOOOOOOOO💓💓💓💓💓
Since when are we hopefuls
This is just a reformation store haha shopping there is the exact same thing
That beachy outfit is so cute. I am pretty bummed that the clothing store is in California not making it accessible for everyone
How well do you think the leggings would work for us girls who weren't blessed with a nice booty?
I am past the 30 mins, but I could really use an Amazon gift card to purchase things for my art classroom. I am a new art teacher, I just graduated college, and I want to give my students the best art experience they can have.
I love that I can live out my inner shopaholic dreams when watching your videos haha, thank you!!
I want to be your buddy, you would be awesome shopping with
love your vid and amazon soooooo much love lots
This is the future! How cool! I would love my dressing room to be ready for me. Tho I feel like I'd put too many things in there since I don't have to carry it lol.
slay
Glade u found stuff u like it looks really fun and we live in the same city so I'm gonna have to travel there soon
Wish I had of known I work at that mall
So fun 🤩 thank u for sharing everything look’s amazing on u !!🎉🥰🙌🏽 can’t wait til they open a store in my state !
Damn i. Too late
Damn I want a store like than in Spain
Heyyy can I have a gift card pleae3
I don’t know how much I like “hopefuls”. I think I preferred your other Intros.  But I get that you want a name for your followers so…
I'M HERE SO EARLY WOW
Comment below
this looks like so much fun!
I love watching all ur videos!! I get a lot of style references from u!!
I just finished the video And I love the fact that you would go all the way to California to go to a store and to present it to all of us so then we could see if he would like it or not and I really appreciate it😋
Love u hope u found your jeans
No I slept in until 2 39 so I couldn't win the give away
hiiiiiiiii
I love her videos. 💕💕
This sounds so awesome!!
Heyyy
hey love your video
This was insane 😆 In a good way!
This seems so fun but I am so curious about the workers' experience because Amazon is not known for treating their warehouse employees well. Getting a new size to you in under a minute must take some serious hustle!
I'd love to see you do small shop hauls!! Amazon doesn't need our money, let's see some cute unique items you can't find in a warehouse store 😍😍
Heyy
coolll
Slayyy!!! You are an icon!
That looks a lot of fun!
Ugh…notifications or not, I’m always at work!
This looks amazing!! Wish they had one in the UK x
Please please can I have an Amazon gift card because I have a jewelry Business and it would really help a lot
OKAY BUT THAT HAIR MISS MA’AM 😩🤌
That looks like a fun shopping experience.
Ahh
hmm
That store is cool
That seemed so fun!!💗💗💗💗💗
I work on Saturdays! so I can't watch right away. I watch when I get home.
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Can I please have the  gift card for my  mom
hi hope
This is a really cool idea for Amazon.
I wonder how you would return things?
Please pick me
Imagine going shopping there and your battery dies
so fun!
Hiiii sorry I’m late
Yeah it is 4 h later but hellow can I have a  100 dollars to buy a prom dress 😭😭
Seems cool, but I wonder how many sizes are available for trying on.
Such a cool video
You know Amazon Has 5.11 tactical clothing.
Hi
Is this cheap ??? No way it is
Might actually have to like clothes shopping again.
👋
Hi
I am subscribed but i didnt get notified 😔
I love your videos!! I think this idea is cool in theory but not having all the options available defeats the whole purpose of having them in the store!!  \
I might go out in public to try this.
I love watching your videos! It’s how I get through folding laundry! 🤣
How futuristic.  Thanks for the sneak peek.  I cant wait to visit one 💕💕
Hi Hope your videos are making my day and I adore your hair can’t wait to see the rest of the video! 😁😁
Me me me lol
This seems so cool! I love all your vids!
Hi
Meeeeee!
I just wanna let you know! Reformation was the first one who had this concept! Years ago when I shop there they already used this dynamic!
I really don't know what to comment 😕
Fun with AI stores. haha..   oh my my ..
My son built the dressing rooms
Thanks :)
hope ur scope is kewl fanx from newZealand...
This is incredible! I'm always sweaty from carrying the clothes around, it's not fun. 😂
Love the idea but the fact that like none of the jeans were there ….. 😬
Noooo I have notifications on and everything and I’m still 4h late! I loved the video regardless! I loved seeing you out trying stuff again! Would love some videos of you out trying interesting stores/restaurants/experiences
I need this in my life
hi hope that store is so cool like our videos if i do win i will get a bday gift for my mom
please
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Very cool
That's really cool. :)
Bro I love your videos do more like this
Wow! That’s amazing! Amazon is changing the shopping world.
I love your video you always brighten my days
Claustrophobic shop
I love the idea!! So much easier way to shop.
I wished you would of ironed it so we could see how great it looks. I sounded like you were just to excited to wait. Love your channel love your picks!! 🤍🌸🤍 would love to see you do a outfit for Amazon ! Would totally buy!
Loved this video. I noticed a lot of the items you ended up purchasing actually had a low amount of reviews on them- something to take note of, that sometimes the hidden gems aren’t always the most reviewed items! (Several Amazon reviews are actually fake so be sure to read them Thoroughly and page through them) sometimes the best quality items only have a few reviews with high stars!   Great video by the way. ❤️
I just stared WATCHING you AND I LOVE YOU
That dressing room!!! In LOOOVE!!
Seems like a lot work to shop. Concept is interesting i ges. But id be annoyed once it said out of stock or cant try on. And probably walk out n go to marshalls.
I hope I can get the next gift card
Hi
I really love your videos and the concept of the store, but with this view you are not only showing the store but promoting the products. I hope that you will soon change your sources of clothing because you have the possibility to not buy fast fashion
I just love your channel 😊💕
Hello! :)
Hi
Fccdcsc
Such a cool vid!
Not them saying “nah” to you 😭😭😭💀
Enjoy your videos!
Love you videos it always makes me smile
Both jeans look phenomenal!
Ngl I forgot it wasn’t sponsored 😂 must be good stuff!
I enjoy the idea of single items on the floor
Okay okay.... I am *REALLY* liking this whole shopping experience!!! This is amazing!
Clicked on this video  You’re so beautiful  I love your hair color  I love your outfit  I love your upbeat videos
That seems like so much fun, I would totally do that but I’m broke lol and I’m just a kid lol.
You would look good in a potatoe sac.  Too flipping cute in everything.
Love !
“And they were like Nah.”
This is such a neat idea. I love that you test out these experiences for us though lol
Well it looks like fun.  Wish there was one near me.
I'm sorry, they said "nah"?? rude.
you look so pretty on your cloths
Oh that is so cool. I loved that its like curated and exclusive feel. Thats awesome. I hate shopping mainly because of try on but I think I like that one
I just found you. Maybe I'm to old but it's fun 😁
This is the coolest store ever!
done
It's amazing!!! I wanna experience it
Love your style.
It looks big and organized easily
im for sure that ima fly here and go
It's my birthday and I was hoping to watch a new video this morning in my bath lol... Good start...
Oops. I was asleep when this went live. 😩
Who is loving hopes hair colour I do
I love that they were like “nah” and you’re like “I’ll do it on my own”
Can you do a shop local video to help the  local businesses instead of a big elitest coorporation?
1:53 I NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THOSE LEGGINGS OR THE LINK PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! AND ALSO THIS DRESS 2:01 🙏
I’m always working when posted lol
What a true level up for a shopping experience. Thank you for the video.
Just started watching your videos! Love your personality and how you edit your videos.
Your so pretty
I would love to go there
You rock
Didn't even realize they had a store?
U really look like Perried Edwards of Little Mix
I’m always late to the party. Super cool they have a store though.
Omg I work in retail and had this in mind years ago. Glad to see idea come to life.
Really Cool store!
Ooo I’m out in the east coast! I hope they open one up here soon!
This is almost Space Age 💫💫💫💫
done
I usually just watch videos and never comment.  But have found yours not only informative but fun! I have been on a diet, lost some weight but still just would not go out in clothes that are now my size.  Watching you and your energy has made me smile and now I enjoy shopping and we are now making plans to go to the amazon store!  Thank you for your channel boosting me up.
Omg!!!!! What an amazing experience!!  I hope they become a world wide thing
Ahhh
Wow I need to get here earlier
ILY
HIIII
looks so fun
loveeeee it
I thought is was cool.
Woow this is the coolest thing i saw
Bezo’s taking over the world
Booo I missed the 30 minute mark sad face
Wow, seriously looks like a great experience!, love not having to carry things
By seeing this,it gives me anxiety . Too much regulations to maintain. I would rather stick to the old ones.
Idk
Thanks for showing !!
I’d love to visit the store!
hello
Love this cant wait to try it
Thats just so helpfull❤
U so cute 🥰
That looks so much fun! 😍
love the video
Did hope move?
Hey

🥰❤
Love your videos!
I love these videos so much
Damn I shouldn’t have slept in 😭 does 3 hours count?🥲
Love the video
Lol
Hiya! Kinda late tho..
this is future life for shoping world =)
This seems interesting
I know it doesn’t apply to you but did they have a plus size area? Or was it really size limited?
why did you not but the blue dress? It was so georgeous on you girl!!!   Sending lots of love from Norway ♡♡
It’s too cool
The jeans made me mad!!!
So cool!
❤️❤️❤️
Me me me!!!!!
Ughhhh this store looks amazing!! Long time follower here!! I have always loved your content...so bubbly & unique finds always!! I wish I got this on timeeee my birthday is June 16th & a Momma of 3 would've been nice to spoil myself!
This video is so fun and very helpful!!!
How was the access for those with disabilities? Elevators? It looks like there’s enough space in between the clothes for a wheel chair but in the dressing rooms? Thanks for taking us along!
Ooh I would LOVE to go to that store!!!
Hi
Great video!!! I am glad you checked it out for us!
Love watching your videos 🤗 been re watching all of them. Leo has to be the cutest dog ever.....
This is pretty cool; I wonder if they'll build one anywhere near me lol
You are so awesome. ❤️🌸
Ugh why did youtube not alert me! The notification people have some work to doooo
I need a new clothes I lost 30 lbs
So cool! Can't wait to give it a try.
🤎
love ya❤️
Who else agrees that hope brings joy to the world :)))
That was really neat! I would much rather try on things from Amazon. Especially shoes. Thanks for sharing!
Love the video!
What a crazy way to shop😅
Cool Video😁
This is kinda wild.
I like this idea
that still seems pretty cool :3
Nah, the dressing rooms are even more sketchy to me. There are more cons with technology.
I would really want a Amazon card I spend like 60 dollars on Amazon in like two days
Hope Allen queen of clothing oddities
Hi
Hey!@@
I absolutely love this idea!
i love amozon
omg! i have to go to California now!
omg coolllll
What a fun and exciting vlog! I live by there and didn’t even know about it lol! Can’t wait to go!!!
This would literally be the only time I’d actually be comfortable using a dressing room! Love this idea
omg!! I love this...cause when I am online shopping... I am mostly like: I wish I could try these on first before buying!! and amazon just fulfilled that dream..thank you so much
hi.
Hey can you review youtuber Rosanna Pansino's merch
Donee! Btw i love your videos
FAB!💗💗💖
That looked like such a fun shopping experience.  I hope to see one in FL soon. :-)
What a fantastic idea ….. I’m in a wheelchair and think this would be a wonderful and easier  shopping experience for me …..
You upload before I wakeup, im never gonna win🤣🤣
Hi
hi
Honestly... I would get really annoyed from an experience like this! Traditional shopping Is the best and honestly I stay on the phone all day, I don't understand why I would Do It while shopping online but in a store 🤔
This is super awesome!
I love your videos 💕
Noo I’m late !
Okay but they need more stores ps: your amazing <3
Can’t wait to visit the store. I like that you can feel the quality and fit before you buy. I can’t buy clothes by size, I really have to try it on first
This actually looks sooooo fun !! Definitely an interesting way to shop !! Definitely an advanced shopping experience and I wonder if other stores will use the same concept 🤔 💭 definitely enjoyed watching 😃
Love your content! I always wish your videos were longer. Just want to get more time with ya! 😀
Great. But my little town will never get one. Maybe champaign urbana. But not danville
I live outside Seattle, and the Amazon fresh stores are super cool
I think Jeff Bezos has to much money that he uses to make more money which he then again uses to make more money, it's very repetitive.
Wow this store is WOW! I would've been knocking the barcodes off everything I touched lol ♥️ happy weekend to you all!!!!
Such a cool video <3
First! I love your channel so much I can’t wait to see your next video I have been subscribed sience you got Leo
That $20 dress is so adorable 🥰
VIDEO IDEA I think it would be cool if you did a review of j80fit. they are youtubers and they have their own leggings. I don't know if you have made a video about then.                        whoever is reading this copy and paste so hope can see this (:
Yes jeans ….. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ love this store….♥️
That blue dress looks fabulous on you and both jeans . Store is super cool love the concept!💜🤙🏼✌️
I think they have another one like this in New York except it's cashless? Not for sure though if it is true though that would be a fun video aswell!
heeyyy :) just woke up and seen you posted. I am home sick with c19 and i always love watching your videos. i didn't know amazon had an actual store, that's so cool
I personally love the whole concept of the store and all the outfits are cutee. Love from India, Hope❤.
Pretty amazing shopping experience.
love uu
Alot of the outfits are super cute also love your hair
the dresses were so pretty!
I loved the video
Wow! What a great shopping experience!
Way to go Hopescope 👍
I'd be in soooo much trouble in there!  I order almost everything from Amazon!!!
It’s so crazy from Amazon
HELLO
That seems like a awesome experience
Hey Hope love your videos
Hi
Boo I was sleeping. haha next time. Have a great day Hope!
Well I have notifications on every time but unfortunately I just got off work. I literally always watch your videos right before I leave the parking lot after I clock out! Maybe you could start posting on Tuesday so I can have a chance to win something! I'm always too late cuz I'm at work
I need to go there
looks realy fun. a new way too shop ❤️🤣🤩
So cool!
Love you hope!
Hiiii have this 🥰🥰🥰
Neat!! Thanks for sharing your awesome experience.
Meanwhile, she's taking 3 hours in the dressing room.  :)
Looks like an interesting place to shop. Not sure if I'd like it or not.
Pick me
Hi
Love it
Cool!
hi
I plan on going to LA this September to go see Pentatonix so I might just have to stop this store. This looks like so much fun. And my husband really loves buying me things, I’m so cheap so it’s really funny.
Think after the bugs are worked out it will be awesome
I hope they have full size ranges of of these in-store, and even carry size-extented brands. One of the issues I have had in going to dressing rooms is asking for size-up options, and being told I either have the largest garment in the range, or the largest they have in store (and will ever have on-shelf). I'm of average weight for women in my country, but plus-size in clothes, and cool clothing stores don't always accommodate that, which makes trying on stuff less fun.
Recently started watching, and today I'm finding myself binge watching
I love your videos hope!
I have watched all your videos
“I like this dress” *exactly to the one she is wearing* relatable
OMG that place is amazing!! So much fun!
Oh I am so excited to see this video!!! I love love you!!!
That kind of store seems fun
Oh what a fun experience! I so enjoyed seeing the new Amazon store. All the outfits looked awesome!
Those dressing rooms are wild! I can't believe the magic closet
Can you get stuff shipped to your house instead of buying there and then? X
love this and you!!!
interesting way to shop
Hi Hope. This is a reminder that we love you and love everything you do. Seeing you have fun is all we need. This was such a cool video and I'm glad your channel has maintained being a reflection of what you wanna do. I love being a Hopeful
Hope! What size did you get in the sweatyrocks jeans? We have similar body types and measurements and I’m also in desperate need of good jeans!
Heyyyy
jou are amasing
love amazon clothes
I wish we had one here, I love your style ☺️
Your Videos always make me so excited 😊 🤗
I knew I should clicked sooner. Love this content though.
Hey
Omg what are we in 2030 or smthn
i loved this!!
Hi!
I love your videos! Keep up the amazing work!! I love that you live in Utah, I also live in Utah!! 🤍
Hi 👋
Not sure how I feel about the store, the purpose of Amazon is supposed to be the fact that you can order but at the same time it would be a really cool experience!! Love your videos, keep up the amazing work!! I love that you live in Utah, I also live in Utah!! 🤍
The jeans seemed like a good idea 🤦🏼‍♀️

Once i didn’t see Leo at the end of the video i felt upset but thennnn he showed up😂😍 Love you and how energetic you are 😍😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
cole
That looks so cool it would be an idea that other stores can also try to implement.
This looks so fun!! The future of shopping is insane🤯
As someone that also has dressing room anxiety, this seems like a perfect solution. Let's hope this will become a worldwide thing! Might actually make shopping enjoyable for me.
OMG I drove past this store the other day.... have to go check it out!
I loooove you 😍😍😍😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰
love your  channel
Reformation also does this, glad to see its trickling down to other retailers! Such a better experience ❤️
Love your shoes!❤️
I live yr vids so much there so fun u inspire me to go out and Not stay in my room lol
Wish they would do one of these stores to Florida!! Love your videos!!
Omg... I got a new job so that Amazon gift card would be heaven sent! I absolutely love you Hope, you are my much prettier sister from another mister!!!! 😂 sending 💕
Very cool! That's for showing us this. Love everything you got too! Many blessings Hope!
hi i actually might come to amazon to see thanks to u i love ur video
What an awesome way to shop. I loved the magic closet in the dressing room.
GIRL IM LATE
Heyy❤️
Hi
This is very interesting! Ty for taking the trip for us!  🤘💯
Wow, so cool!!
That dressing room could be a hotel room
This is WILD.... definitely futuristic lol
Love you!!! Can u review the Shefit brand!!
choose me I love amazon shopping but I think I am late :(
Can you do a Good American review? Since you need jeans anyway lol
I swear the notifications for new don’t come instantly. Every time I get one, I click instantly, and the video has already been up for 2 hours.
Wow, technology at it's best,the store looks clean and neat. The only disadvantage is the unavailability of of the clothes for try ons.   Everything looked so good on you,what an experience.
hiii
That place looks amazing! I might have to go   in person 😍
Comment
I would love to go it seems so fun!!
Hi.
what a cool idea !!
Great video!
hi
I love this!
So cool to watch!
Hiii I love your videos  and I love amazon
love it
Hii
I seen this store a few weeks ago, I was wondering when it was going to open. Now I need to go
Im always get it late 😩 and my notifications are on
i’m late but i was at the gym when you posted :(
I must visit this store!!!! 🙌🏼🤘🏼
They literately emailed back "Nah." I'm screaming
meow
Would love to shop like this!
Looked really fun.
DONE
Hi hope I love Amazon please let me know if I can have the gift card
I live near Americana and love this store!
Hey so cool
oh hi hope scope i recent ly found ur videos and i love them how offten do u post?
late but im here
Can't wait to see this
Sounds like a dream store! Too bad it's on the other side of the country from me! 😥
Wow it’s look so futuristic. Soon it will be the new way of shopping every wherever.
Love the dressing rooms!
love that store
Heyyy
Love your videos
I love your videos they are so informative
Love your videos hope
i will definite check it out
I always love your videos!
A big hard NO for me….for several reasons. Even if I didn’t boycott Amazon a few years ago.
Hey I sent u dm a few weeks ago abt these puppy slippers I saw…….pls do try them….also ur videos are damn fun to watch plus I love the pink
What a crazy/fun experience!!!
This would be pretty cool to try.
Pick me❤️👍🏻👀
That is Awesome!!!
Interesting
Love you
Dang I missed the time that definitely looks like a fun experience and I would try it out. Cause I hate shopping and the whole dressing room person asking questions.
You'll be more familiar about the process next time you go.  This looks like the future.
Too bad about the jeans, but the stuff is cute!
This is dangerous lol. Sooo mad I just got notified at 930 PST... notifications aren't working 😭
I would love to know if they are size inclusive? I’m a size 18 /2XL and I often have a hard time finding my size in cute trendy pieces on Amazon. Did you see items that were available for try on in larger sizes? This is a super cool concept though
Cool store!
loves
hey
🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍💫
😊👍🏽
HII
Omg, I absolutely want to shop there to try out the dressing room 😘
I have wanted to go to an amazon store
The only issue I see with this is if you’re in a hurry and don’t want to try stuff on is there a way to like not try it on
I love your videos. Don't think I would like this store
why are your videos getting shorted every time :( i miss them being a bit longer, it feels rushed
How cool I love it . Enjoy your show .
i love your videos
This is one of the best vid ever  I abouslty  love ur vid and I always  mentioned  u to my friends ❤ plss can I have the gift  card  I never won anything  plss
hi
How interesting! Love your videos as always!
That looks like a store I would love but they would never open one in South Africa.The experience looks very luxury.
No way Amazon actually said that 😂😂😂 P.S i love the way you say leggins 😂💖
You’re hilarious and had no idea an Amazon store even existed!
Amazon shopping is frustrating because sizing and materials are not always available.  Love the scanner then shipped to your dressing room.
Hiii
Where in Burbank is this located?
The Magic Closet is everything!! What a great idea and thank you for taking us with you💖
This is a pretty cool idea but it seems more like a drag with all the added stuff 😅
I love the concept of the room as a whole though.
What a great idea. Hopefully they will have a similar Amazon store in Canada 🇨🇦
This is so futuristic hahaha I love it
Hi
Have you checked out the  amazon grocery store? Also very cool
You look fire in the pink dress!
Well I'm late but this looks cool
Hello
Overall, I really like the concept. Highly personalized which makes the shopping experience more efficient. As other person commented above, there are a few things to improve upon. But it's a very good start.
This is such an interesting thing. I know I have had a subscription to a clothing service for awhile, this makes me want to give amazon a try.
Hello
I would love to travel there because i have like never bought anything on amazon since my parent dont want me to
What a great way to start the weekend!
I really want to go there but it’s in California and I live in Virginia you’re so lucky you find some good things there
I love amazon!!!
I love her vids!!! ♫
I did it
Yay
Ahh so fun! Thanks for showing us 😍
So good
That last blue dress you tried on in store is amazing on you 😍
am I late??😅
Dang 30 min late
the puffy tote is so amazing and gorgeous
Hi Hope! I am subscribed to you I like this video and I’m commenting within the first 30 minutes I hope I win one of those Amazon gift cards!
It has been 1, hour but I love your videos! Could you mabye try to recreate outfits that you see on instagram or like any other social media if you know what I mean! Love you!
❤️❤️❤️
Lovely vid!! :))
Looks so cool !!
Oh no I’m late!!! But what a fun video
Can’t wait to have one here. Anything looks good on you.
I’m late because I overslept Noo  I really needed this I had a whole week of bad luck and got scammed noooo I’ll try again next time  😭🫶
Great video. I would love to check out this store !
Aww I'm too late to win the gift cards but gl to everyone who was!
Looks interesting
I don't know half my sizes
Wow!
Ok I take that back I was able to get in there and get the rainbow dress for my daughter in her size before they ran out! 😊 thanks for your video!
Hi I hope I can get a Amazon gift card I really like your videos I watched your video literally all the timeline 🥰
I think this would be an  awesome way to shop!
HIIII this is soo cool
That’s so cool 🤯😃
This makes me want to online shop now haha:/
Hihi
Hope I love you!! You're so beautiful and your editing skills are amazing!!!
I am sorry I am late to the gift cards!
Hi
My favorite is definitely the the last dress, the rainbow one.
GOD LOVES YOU
Laved this sorry im a little late been a sub and never wont lol luv ur vids
Hi
good video
Bruh I just went home from California 🫥 are you kidding me?! 😭😭 anywayyyyyy love your vid ❤️❤️
I love your video and now I’m looking at the leggings
Generally I have anxiety going into stores that are overwhelming. The feeling of piles of piles of clothes to choose from. I like the idea that they only have one item at the floor I hope more stores catch on with that.
Hope this is so cool I didn’t know this store existed!
Love this!
Seems like a very cool store! Which I can check it out someday.
amazon should make home decor store, I think would be much better if we could see  actual furnitures and then it will be shipped to us
Hey. Love your videos. ❤️
This looks like a horrible shopping experience....would never ever go their and I pray to God that this isn't how the future of shopping will be
Love you 💜💜🥰🤗
Would literally love to have a gift card because my birthday is right around the corner!!
Thanks for always doing give aways!!! 💛💛
I have never shopped clothing from Amazon. Maybe I will try it out soon! Love your videos Hope!
im booking a ticket to cali like now!
I love your videos… I’m such a fan … keep up the good job
Those jeans are beautiful!!❤️🔥🔥
2nd I liked and I am already subed❤😋
Love you hope! Great video! Looks like a fun interesting store! You do so much for us, we're so thankful! :)
The items u modelled in store r great
That is so cool. Can’t wait to try it. And let’s see how fast the stuff you got will sell out.
I love your videos
hi
I love this video!
So cool what a fun experience
Wonder if they are size inclusive in terms of carrying larger/plus size items.
I would love the card 😅 to try those leggins
this so innovative actually
omg
I love this shopping center.
Sad I wasn’t in the first 30 minutes but I loved the Amazon style store and your pics.
Heyyyyy
hi
Where is the first store?
One of the first!
Ohh it's really fun to watch you videos. Loving it
so fun
❤❤❤😂😂
I really would like this in Dallas. The grocery idea was cool but it’s easier for me to order online. It’s a lot different than fashion.
Good
This is such a bizarre concept. Not sure how I feel about it.
Late
I've never seen anything like this. Its so cool! Thats for showing us:)
This is awesome, this is much more practical then ordering something and hoping that it fits! 🌈✨
wow love this store 🎉❤
That store is so boujee. Love ya hope!
Im not late 🥲
I wonder  how that would work for someone who blind or vision impaired
Thanks for video! I really want to visit the store
I’ll have to put it to where it notifies me when you post because I’m always finding out an hour later 🥲
Wow such a weird shopping experience! Very cool. But imagine being like "i cant shop there my phone has low battery....." what happens if your phone battery dies midway through
spent the whole day watching your videos
Hiiiiiiii I love your videos soooooo much
Hii! I think im before 30 minutes and would really appreciate an amazon giftcard!! Ty!
I love this video it's such a unique idea.i love how you show the negative and postive side of these shops love that!!
Done I’m done liking and sub
Yea I like Amazon
Loved this video sooo much!
Love the jeans and those dresses are so amazing for Summer.
love the new vid
this store looks so funn
HIII HOPE, this video was awesome. i love amazon and i would love to check this place out. you made it such a fun experience. love you 💕💕
Oooh.  Thank you for this experience.  Now I know.
I can’t believe this is finally a thing, next time I go to California I will have to check it out. I love this video
I love Hope so I don't know how to ask this question. Is she no longer in to workout clothes and activities?
All of your videos are perfect for me😍 I have NEVER been disappointed and I always look forward to the next one😁
I love this video. This store is so fun I can wait to check it out on my next trip to CA
Your hair looks so good babe💕
Hi
hi hope
Another reason why I wished I live in America 🤣
I love your channel. I’m an agoraphobic so I live vicariously through your adventures. Thanks again for your great channel
Hey I'm ready I love u but I hope I win because for my channel and I really want to do a very cool video hope I win
I didnt like the beige beach dress. wrong color for you and I like seeing you in clothes that show of your gorgeous body. you are perfect in every way. my shape is lost and it was never as good as yours.
Favorite reviewer on YouTube ❤️
Kinda want this store to come Toronto... kinda. Lol
Wow $94 for the green ruffle shirt omg cute but NO that price is insane
HOPE! I love your videos!
It's just a bummer there's only one store..
Huh, this looks really cool! I hope they try this at places I could actually drive too within my state, haha!
thats really cool, i need to go there asap
An Amazon store is genius. They sell so many cute clothes but a lot I'd rather see in person first before purchasing.
Love you videos…I hope Amazon opens more of those store inOrange County…but hey they opened a grocery store!
this is incredible
Honestly love your content it's really motivating and helps us to find the things we actually want at a very cheaper rate and plus your videos are so fun to watch! Love the content🤍🤍🤍
Always get anxiety in the dressing room too!!!
It would be awesome if they brought this nation wide!
Loved this!!!! So jelly.
Looks like I gotta go shopping online! Way to far from cali ironic cause that’s my name 😂.
Ammmmmmmm I still in time😅🤣
Hi!!!!
Great video
Hi I love your videos ❤️💞
I love ur vids so much
Hii
I like the "magic closet" idea. I can't tell you how many times, I NEED a different size in something only to have to get re-dressed and go hunt it down myself.  In Nordstrom's the associates will do this for you, but ugh .. I have to get dressed to open the door to get the correct size.
Pretty cool concept. I mean the idea is there, but the execution seems to be lacking. Like the jeans seem to all be the same style just different colors. At least the idea is there.
i love amazon
Omg why is my state so freaking BORING.. I wanna go .. I absolutely LOVE Amazon..I’m sooo with you on the ACTIVE ware love it live in it .. lol
Love yaaaa
I love your videos!!! So fun and you look stunning!!!
iconic
They'll have to come to Iowa for me!
Love this!!!
I wish we had one! I think I'd like shopping more.
I want to go here!!
Loved this video! I want more
♡☆
this place i actually pretty good for a shy introvert like me lol (yes shy and introvert are both different but im both)
wait this is amazinggg
Hi
love it!
Awesome video
Actually there is an Amazon store at a mall near where I live, Amazon having in person shopping is so cool!
Loved this video
Im always learning something new with you 😂   Loving to be able to experience that with you
I love seeing your videos. thank you for always being so positive!
Hi I love to come here but it's SOOO warm outside its like 50 degrees!
Omgoodness I need one of those gift cards! Especially since I am moving! I need new decor!!!!
That is a cool idea!!
Thank you for sharing!
i love this video! it’s so fun
I now want every store to be this way!!
Hii
Yessss let’s go!!!
Dangit I'm 30 minutes late for the gift card :(
<3
Oh my I’d love it if they were in my area.
I like the idea but what if my phone runs out of battery? 😆
Love the video, but the way the store works seems a bit too different for me.
Could you do a video where you test out Mary Kay products? Mary Kay is a makeup/skincare brand, I've been wanting to try it, but I want to see your review on it first! Btw I love your videos keep up the great work!
Enjoy watching your videos! 💕💕💕
hahah this is amazing!
Amazon was missing out not collaborating with you on this one 🤔
I love the idea of not having to speak to anyone-I also have dressing room anxiety. I need a list/video/map of your shopping bucket list!! I would love to know what other cool stores you have your eye on! Maybe one will finally be somewhere I might be visiting lol.
Wow!! I am glad you made the trip to Calfornia.  Love your videos!!
I am  probably  to late its says 1 hour I commented as soon I  saw before I got  out bed and  checked my  cell phone which I  check before  my feet hit floor  Maybe  I win next time  please keep making  more videos  you are amazing
This is soooo cool!!!
Interesting.
I was drooling watching this entire thing 🤤 okay that’s it… I’m getting my plane ticket, going to California, stopping to congratulate Brit Brit and then I’m going to this store!!! Who’s coming with me!?! 🤩🤩
This is so cool
Heyyyyyyyyyyy
Basically ordering ramen in Japan but for clothes.. very cool
😍😍
This is awesome 😅
That is  the reaction when we get a different size dress and realised a little late 😜😂
cute idea but not sure it’s worth it if they don’t have the sizes
love this i liked and subscribed
I love the dressing rooms and privacy of it, and easy exchanging of sizes.  I used to hate American eagle cuz they’re up your ass the whole time making sure you like their jeans, and when you need to switch sizes they make you so feel so judged.
You should go to Reformation Hope! They’ve had this dressing room system for years now!! Plus their clothes are amazing !!
Damn. Too late.
Love your hair Hope! Thanks for another fantastic video!
So interesting!!!
i missed the deadline :(
Looks so hectic but I wanna go!!!
omg I love Amazon! We need one of these in TN! Great video!!
Love from Korea 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
a fun video indeed
Super cool
What a totally new way of shopping…so much easier than trying to search for your size!
Oh no! 30 min too late. 😶
Love your videos ❤
Hello
That looks like the shopping experience I would love to have every time.
I was in LA when one of the stores on their grand openings. Me and my friends where talking about how Amazon is taking over the world and it’s not a good thing.
Oh my god I LOVED Phil of the Future!!!
I so enjoy your videos, even though I'm 70 yo
AHHH I LOVE IT!!
Love your videos
love from london
This store is so cool
Looks like a cool idea
Damn I’m always late but at least I made it 😂
Hello
I live in Southern California. Would love to try this store. Nice video
Nice video
I have never been this early but glad I am :) love watching your videos.
This seems so much more fun than online because online you don’t really know what you are going to get. I loved this video!!!❤️
So cute
So cool!
amazon should let their employees unionize
I kinda want to go, but...... kinda hate the idea..... 😕
Hope I went thrifting and I found like 4 lululemon jackets in a row on a rack!
okay but i love those heels (the black ones that you wore in the store)
P.s. idk how I feel about the one item thing
hiiiiii
Lol dang I'm an hour in
Omg hii early!!
I hope I could visit that store soon 🥰🥰
hi
thats cool
That’s super dope
It’s like Amazon copied the Reformation store.
I want a gift card!!!
I love all your videos and enjoy your personality very genuine and so funny at times love ya 💗
Love your videos
Need one of these in the UK it would have come in useful for my wedding  and honeymoon in 13 days
I find it hilarious that Amazon kills in person retail stores and then becomes a retail store themselves.
Love it
We can always count on hope to investigate for us 😆
Thank you for being you, as a single mom idk if you know how helpful you are. I front have friends really and you are like my best friend !
love shopping on Amazon because I can try it all on at home and then decide. rather not go to a store
I wanna card
Love you videos! I wish they were longer
Heck yeah
Doneee xxx 🇿🇦🇿🇦
Jo
I love these videosss
I can't believe that amazon comms responded with "nah" (or pretty close to it) to your email. What a waste of PR head count from company's management. Great video as usual! You always bring up smile on my face even if everything sucks :) Thank you!
loved this vid :)
This store has potential lol
That looks so fun
Aahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
I feel like this adds more work to shopping it’s cool tho
Wow! What a cool concept!
I love that you created a video about this! Super trippy shopping experience.
I LOVE your Channel! I’m never patient enough to wait for the next one! Keep it up! ❤️
I would love to go there, wish they had it in Canada😞. Love Amazon and your videos
I really love you so much  I watch your video every time ☺️☺️☺️
Your videos are so hilarious, love you!
I'm loving this
Hiiiii!
Very cool
I wish they had store around here
I have never heard of this. AMAZING!!!
This is so cool
I would love to try this
PICK ME!! Lol
It truly looks like an amazing experience. Too bad I doubt my country will see that store 🥺
The dressing rooms look like a NY city apartment.
❤️
This store looks fun
this seems so cool
Love you
🥲🥲🥲🥲 I'm late again
Thanks for sharing!
I would love it! because I hate leaving with nothing because they don't fit me so it would be so nice to change them from the inside
Loved the choices, I can't wait to see how this affects retail clothing shops next.
Damn it's awesome
Oh my gosh sweaty rocks it’s like the best I buy it all the time
Your the best hope!
I wanna go.!
pls pick me, i love your videos and i wanna get gifts for my friends and familyy!!!
I’m ready girl for the gift card 🖐
Love your content and now I know there is an Amazon store....thanks to YOU!!! 😃😃😃😊
Amazon had an actual store in my local mall and it recently went out of business. They realized the beauty of Amazon was the fast shipping (I live in a same day zone) The irony that Amazon put their own brick and mortar store out of business 🤣
Omg never knew about a store like this
Did I make it for the amazon gift card??? Thanks for making the video!
Eeeeeeek
Fuck Amazon and bezos
Aw man I got the notification but I was doing something and just now was able to watch. 😞
This is super interesting!
I love the idea of this but they need to have the stuff to try on in store.
I find your site totally enjoyable.  I’ve learned a lot from you and have tried a couple of things.  I would probably go to this Amazon store, I can’t wait for your next video
This is so crazy! Did they have very many associates working there? Since all is so high tech!
I love your videos so much ☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
How Awesome !
Hi :)
Greetings from Seattle, this is Amaze!
X
I'm sad I haven't your channel sooner than just a couple weeks ago.  I love the vibes you give off and the positivity you radiate.  Even when things suck, you still keep a good attitude about it.  I need more of that in my life LOL
Heyo
Cool to see but I’m afraid I’d accidentally order things I never intended to.
Nooooo I missed the comment time bc I was sleeping dang
I hope I’m not late.
99
❤️
I only liked the last dress you had on and the black leggings 😬 the jeans are not flattering at all 🙈
OMG  THIS IS SO COOL
<3333 amazingggg
hi
Hi
I loved the video!
Hi
That pink body-con dress looked really nice on you🥰🥰
Where is that? Santa Monica?
That's kind of cool for a concept!
Such a cool store!
Love you
Hope to lead the way!!!
Love this video
Omg!!! Really love everything
Loved this video!! 🤩
Neat dressing rooms
Omg this is so cool!!!
damnnnn 30 mins late 😅😅 dope vid thooo:)
Such a cool store!
I would love to have one of these near me!
LOVE THE VIDEOS
You're the best!
Love your channel!!
Wish all dressing rooms would change to this way.
hi
What a dream store😩
I love all of your videos so much!! There so fun!!
love this just wish it was in canada
This is such a fun idea!
This is soo cool but I feel like it to much a hassle  I love watching these videos cuz I know I will never be able to go to these places
Girl. I am always like a half hour late. Wahhhhh lol
I'm 30 min late
Love this video its so fun to watch!
Omg this is so cool!  I feel your pain with the jeans, I can’t find any that I absolutely love & fit me everywhere. If it fits my butt & thighs , it’s too big in the waist. The struggle is real!💯😬 Sending you love Hope!❌⭕️❌⭕️
unique customer experience
This is super cool…
Love u hope
Have to definitely look this up and visit this store 😁😁😁😁😁
Not sure I like this idea.   How ever it does seem to be a unique experience.
I can’t wait to go , I’m gynecologist weekend
Can't wait for this to be in my city, but probably I'll have to wait 5 more years
This sounds like a good concept but they need to have the jeans in the store!!!
i really like the idea of seeing one of each item and then having your size sent to a dressing room for you!
I would like this more if it can tell me where to locate items. Like these pants are in section C5. Also, based off of the little style quiz, That they would suggest clothing pieces. Similar to what they do with Amazon Styler/ personal shopper.  But you picking up the clothes.  Would be really cool feature.
We have the same body type I used to feel anxious all the time but seeing you rocking all the clothes made me more confident ....thanks girl😂💕
Missed it 😔 Cool video😀
Wow this is unreal
Damnit im late 😭
Im i lateeeeee
Love u u are so amazing
I love this new way if shopping and the fitting room 💖
I love ur videos and positivity
❤️
Omgg💙💙💙
I think this would frustrate me after awhile.  Not a store I would visit often.
damm just missed the 30 min! hahah
Hello
The way you realistically put out your views is what I really like about your video and that's what makes u different ✨💗🤌
Amazing! i absolutely love when Hope uploads these types of videos, I’m definitely gonna stop by next time i’m around the area!
girl!!!!! that blue dress tho!!!!!!! Need it!!!!!!
I’m within the hour hope I’m not too late ⏰ I’ve liked and been subbing for a long time ❤️
I’d love that I’m sorry my phones been on charge
💖💖💖
I like this! What a cool shopping experience.
That looks so cool. I cannot imagine not carrying my stuff though, I feel like I would immediately forget everything I’d send to the dressing room and end up with like a million things to try on lol. Love your content!!  very big fan, fun videos to watch
I really like your video. And with to go and see the Amazon store.
I love the last dress! Where Leo?
yas
It’s crazy how all of this just gets thrown in there….. it’s never ending 😱
This seems so Cool!! I want to try this
I always dont know what to think of Amazon but that changing room is genius! No running around half naked looking for another size when you shopping all by yourself...
I really hope that's the future of clothes shopping. Not necessarily with Amazon specifically, but with every store.
This store looks fun but a little too futuristic for my taste 😁😁😁
I love your videos!
Love this! Hope they open one by me. Obsessed with the 'magical closet' idea
Reformation stores in LA have been doing this for years!! I had the same experience in 2019!
Fun!
I know I am late but I love your videos
I love your videos they always make my day!
Hope your always brighten my day! I know that I’m not 30 minutes when it came out but you literally look good in everything
This is such a cool concept!!! Honestly love this lol
can i have the gift card i love your videos and watch all of them and im subscribed
You made my day while I’m finishing packing
Where is this  amazon store.. I'm 50 years old and I don't go shopping very much for myself. LOL I wear the same bra it's over 3 years old and falling apart that tells you how much I shop so I always love watching your videos because you shop shop shop shop LOL
Not available in store or try on?! Why on the shelf lol. Cool concept tho. No lugging around a bunch of clothes to try on
interesting concept
Love your videos! always on tune for new videos
What futuristic way to shop. I love it..
Wow I love this . I actually love everything you got especially the beige dress and such good price range ❤️
this would be such a fun shopping experience! The magic closet alone is a game changer!
Sort of jealous we don’t have one.
I don't know if I'm within the first 30 minutes but hey I'm trying
Looks cool!
Can you do a review on old navy active wear? I really want to know what you think about the clothes there!
I wanna win and I love your vids so cool
love ur vid
Hiii
hiiii
Hope I love you Chanel and I love how honest you are❤️
Such a cool experience!
Enjoy the Day Hope! <3
Wish we had one buy us love watching you

This store looks so fun!
I missed it darn grocery shopping but I wish we had theses stores in Canada
Late because my toddler made a food mess 😭 then I realized I was never subscribed but I watch you so much I still get alerts when you post 😂
So exciting!! I wanna go to Burbank now, lol.
ughhh i wish i could go there
i looove it
This is so cool!!! I am obsessed with your videos! 💜💜
just in time for my trip to California. thanks for your video
I ADORE this video and now I want to go out and check the store.  Love you Hope!
I love your videos
Wow
I really like ittttt
For someone who gets crazy anxiety when shopping at a store.. this looks like something I would love to try.  I love the magic door that brings different sizes. :)
Honestly the best video for now
What a cool concept:)
Omg this store was so cool! 😁
Pick me
I really love the futuristic vibe, i’d love to go!
Interesting. Might be worth a ride up to LA. Looks like fun!
ahhhh I wanna go
Hi! I love your videos. I hope that you’re having an awesome day!

I hope this takes off all over.
Shein did this in Belguim
What a fun video!
LoveHopeScope
So hyped for more of these stores!!!!
This is what I need - less awkward interaction with employees about sizes and affordable options
Interesting 🧐
Cute video!
I got the notification but a car crashed into my electric pole outside and I had to deal with that before I could watch your video. Looollllll.
i enjoy watching your videos....😄
This looks amazing. That’s for scoping it out for us
this is kinda fun
Looks cool but I have to agree what's the point of having items you can't try on.
Loved!  How cute!  What a dis…nah.
U r soo funful hope ❤️❤️good luck
Whoop!! Love the video!
I want to go to this store so bad!!
love this video  the clothing really  nice

Love your videossss. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗😍😍✨✨😍✨
wow we are going to cali in a a month im so going there
done
Love that grey jacket😍
such an interesting experience, ill have to check it out
i feel like reformation was the first brick and mortar to revolutionize this futuristic dressing room experience
Loving this Amazon concept. Thanks for always trying things out for us 🥰
Love from India ♥️
I just don't see the pants trying on or anything actually to really work that well on a lot of people considering clothes aren't always used to size. It also takes away the excitement of rummaging through the racks, trying to find good deals and/or your size.
This looks so fun!
Hi
That’s a cool shopping experience. So high-tech. It keeps stores open, which is what people who work in retail need.
LOVE YOU BABY
am i late lol
Hi hope pick me
.
Interesting concept!
Love your legging loving lifestyle
heyyy
This is so cool
This looks fun. I peersonally hate carrying stuff around to try on
New subscriber but love ❤ u
Looks cool
Your outfit in the intro was so pretty! Keep up the good work Hope 💞
I love you 😍
Love the hair 🖤
This is so cool
Amazon is taking over everything! Awesome video as always hope 👍
Ow I have to get a flight to California!!
Why Amazon gotta be so rude with that nah?! Lol
THis store is so cool!
This is wild.
I love this video! I think this store is a great idea! Thanks for showing us!!
I’m commenting 50 minutes after posting but I just graduated from college in engineering !! I love youuuuuu and your videos .
Is there a buy now option instead of trying everything on? I hate trying on clothes at the store!
Love this video! Can't wait to see more😍💞
plllllllllllllllllllllllllllllls give me the gift card I love you but I really need 100$ for my birthday. I seriously have nothing to spend and It is my sixteenth
Beach vacation gorgeous dresses!

HI IM EARLY I THINK OMG
That is such a cool store! Would love to go there

Hi

Damn I missed the 30 minute mark 😟😭😅🥲 love the video tho !! ❤️❤️❤️
You are stunning as always! I'll have to check this out!
Hey I’m hoping to go
Oh noooo I'm late lol
I second that this video seems more like intentional, sustainable shopping where you will probably use a lot of the things you found 🙂
I had no idea that stores like this exist lol
Me
Hi I’m late uhhhgggg but I love u
I missed the first 30 minutes :). I had to sleep in today!!  This store looks fun but I’d still rather shop online!!
This looks so cool
i loveeeee your outfit in the intro
Dang!  I will be a little confused there!  But loved!  😘
I love you so much 💋
your choice is awesome I like your dressing sense
Thats actually so cool
This looks so cool! I want to shop here!
Love it
Question..... If you want to return an item, can you take it to an Amazon return like ups or Khols?  Or do you have to take it back to the store?
Hellow I am obsessed with your videos
Can't wait to check this out!! Love your videos!
well, I didn’t make the first 30 minutes but whoot whoot! I freaking love shopping. I freaking love leggings. heck yeah hope scope
This is amazing. Shopping of the future.
Wow! Amazon! 😁
So cool
Hi
hi i liked subcribed and im commenting now
Love you Hope!
hellllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
I know I’m late to the party but that looks like fun to do and this comes from a person to go to stores and shop.
This reminds me of the Reformation store in SF! It also has single items on the floor (you just tell employees what size you need). They also have a touch screen in the fitting room to add more clothes/sizes  and browse (with a similar closet that gets filled from the other side with what you asked to try on).
I love the idea of this store. Feels so futuristic and looks like it would be an enjoyable experience! That last dress was so cute on you!!
Love the outfir
Gotta go
I hate shopping in store. Love the vids
Just @ the 30 minute time mark hehe
I love the blue dress
Love all of your videos! 💕
This is awesome!! I would have my closet full in 10 minutes 😅
Hey hope!
ooooo
Ooh shooot I overslept I’m here at 49 minutes live
Love your videos!!
Love this
Hi
💜 this new way of shopping 🛍 😍
Love all your videos...can't afford the stuff so it's fun to watch you.
I've never commented before but I'm so excited to win the gift card! :)
This reminds me of shopping at Reformation. Similar concept with one size on the floor and having them sent to your room.
I love shopping with you. Did they have appliances in  the store
So cool!
I love watching your videos. There so fun and adventurous. This looks so cool and I had no idea this existed. ❤️❤️
This seems like fun and there’s definitely some futuristic positives but I have misgivings about this.  As awesome as it is that they deliver your new selected items to you quickly I just wonder how stressed the employee is in the back pulling that item to get it to you that quick. Amazon isn’t known for treating its pickers nicely. I love the concept of the room as a whole though.  Also does the store offer free wifi? Not everyone has unlimited data (or as a traveller might not have a phone plan while being touristy and visiting) that seems like a big thing if they don’t offer free wifi. I also wonder how they handle people who’s prime accounts are based in another country. It’s also wholly dependent on your phone and my phone absolutely dislikes QR codes so I’d be out of luck unless they can offer you a scanner to shop with. The codes falling off the rack all the time also seems super poorly designed.
Looks like fun.  I would love to go there.
Wow, another reason to go to California
This is a super cool store
Love that store!
I love this!!
Wow, I would never leave that store😂
Omg that romper is perfect for a wedding I’m going to
i love your videos they help me soo much with my size abs to not trust instagram or tik tok ads lol
I don’t know how I feel about this 😮
Wow
I'm late nooooooooooooo
Hi, I would like a gift card
Love ur style
Hi
I love the idea of an Amazon Style shop in person! I've bought clothes off them before and didn't like the quality so the idea of going in person is genius. Dang it, Amazon. Every time I think I kicked the addiction you just keep pulling me back in 😆
YouTubers making videos for Amazon gives them a great idea of how user-friendly the store is what could be improved!! I love this! How does the return policy work? Do you have to return to the store or can you go to any random Amazon return place and ship it back?
love it!!😊😊🌷🌸
Heyy
This looked so fun and stressful at the same time lol
So interesting!!! Thanks for sharing your experience!
I mean I AM going to be in Cali soon...
I'd love to go check it out!
I love your channel sm💗💗💗
How many of these stores R there. Are there any in Massachusetts. Like video.
I did it
Love this! Thanks for showing us how this works! Would love to visit!
Hi! Love to see it.
Cool! 😮
Hiiii

Awesomeness.  Very cool idea . I love me some amazon
I still don't want to shop in store, but it's cool.
Hopeeee
Woohoo
Looks so cool😍
This is so cool. Kinda want to go there, but I know I won’t be able to restrain myself lol.
Love it!!
OMG THIS IS WHAT I NEED
It's kind of annoying if items aren't available for try on
I would love to shop there
best parts of online and offline shopping combined!
Wow! Thank you for yet another amazing video 💗
Ok, this is kinda awesome! Great idea. I’d likely buy way too much 🤦🏻‍♀️😂

My darn phone would die while I was there 😂
hiiii
Looks like a cool experience! Hopefully they have one popping up in Seattle. Love your videos 💕
How fun
So, Cool! Amazon can come up with a amaZing things or terrible things.
Love your videos, 💕
I loveeeeee. Ittttty thisssss isss sooo coollllllllllll
Woahh the store concept is so cool
Oh my gosh this might be a game changer. I struggle with my knowing my size. Fluctuating/body issues you know… don’t really enjoy shopping/being around crowds anymore.. but THIS. I might actually leave the house today haha
This is so cool 😎
I’ve shopped at an Amazon store before but never for clothes!
Done I really what that Gift card
Can’t wait to try this!!
Why didn't I reach here on time
Woww. You do a great job at showing off the store! Thanks!

Woah! I’d love to try this out!
Honestly I love hopes videos so much, because it gives us an idea of what we want to get and wear to get it. 🙂👍🏻Love your videos Hope!
such a interesting concept, if only they had better size options 🥲
Thanks for bringing us along <3
Hi
cool store
I actually love that store! I'm sure they will never trickle down to small towns but I love the price and variety of Amazon, but I also really like to try things on and I like to be able to decide I want a new Roland walk out of the store with that top.  It is ironic that Amazon killed of so many brick and mortar stores and now is looking at branching out into brick and mortar themselves.
My dad while they
Love the concept. Can’t wait until the bugs are worked out
Hi
Would love to win
I want to go!
Love from India ❤️❤️
So much fun!!! I love the jeans and that bodycon dress. But Hope, those 2 blue dresses you tried on looked amazing on you!!
Looks like a cool store.
30 minutes! I need a gift card! My son's birthday is coming up and this is his first birthday on my own with him and I could really use some help to give him an amazing birthday
LOVE this video
Wonder if they are opening stores at other areas of the US?
Looks fun. But can see the frustration.
I am going to this store today. I like video. I want to experience it. Especially fitting room!
I'M EARLY, KINDA 😍🤍
💓💓💓💓
Why am I in love with the idea of a one item on the floor system it’s so high end. Then you don’t have to interact for a dressing room. I’m in love🥰
it feels very frustrating when you have to scan, wait and then find out you cant try it on... cool concept tho
Anyways Amazon is living future life and also I loving your hair girlllll💕🤌🏻 I  am getting done same hair like youu
This is so cool!
Omg this is so cool!! I wish I could go there!
please give me gift card i love you r videos you are amazing
Cool
Fine
Not carrying clothes around or a cart.... that's my dream!!!!!!!!
Ordered those Amazon leggings and got a “try before you buy” option I have never seen before?? They cost nothing to send them, then are 26 if I choose to keep them after 7 days, or I can send them back at no cost. I love that!
Heyy
Hi!
Ur awesome !!!
This is funn!
Love this concept!
God I can’t believe that Amazon is doing this, they will eventually take over probably lol
Thank you, Hope!  Tyler & Leo too  ❤️🐾❤️
I actually really like this concept- sometimes Amazon clothes can be hard to buy online when you don't know how things feel.  Hopefully they come out with more of these stores!!  My Amazon cart of currently full of school stuff for next year!! (I'm a 4th grade teacher) :)
I think I would be too frustrated to enjoy the experience 🙃 but I think once they work out the kinks it will be dope
What a cool store!
This is a great video! Love you hope!
Such a cool video....
🎉🎉
Literally I love this store I wish I was there when you were there like oh my God I saw you

Seems like a great idea for an Amazon store
❤️
Love your videos ❤️❤️❤️
Yessssss!!! This is amazing.
That is so cool! I want to visit this place and try it out.
That has to be the coolest store
What a nightmare! I wonder if that really was a forever 21… c’mon Jeff Besos! Can’t build his own building. 🤣 looks like fun though!!
Love your videos 😊
I love your videos! Subscriber from India ❤️
Hi

Wiiii

Very cool concept
Well dang, I’m here at minute 39
Your amazing

Hheeeyyyyyy hope
Everything about this seems awesome!! 👗 You find the coolest things!! 😃
Such a great video and love what you bought, Hope! I also love the delivery system of different sizes to your dressing room - SO awesome!!!
Do an Indian outfit haul 🥺
idk if im late. :(  im already subbed tho:)  also i have pink and blond hair too :)
This looks fun
This was really cool to watch, I love that you just give an honest review without caring it’s really helpful to know which stores you’d find better for all of us to shop at!
The store looks nice but I don't think they should keep the products that are not available in the store.
I love thrift stores and rummaging through clothes - not sure how much I’d enjoy this place
HOPE, HI. This is so cool ❤ and so fun I would love to go there😊 and I love watching your clothing reviews
Don’t know how I feel about it. Seems fun but frustrating at the same time🤣
HOW COOL…. 🤣
Loved this video!!
Omg you look stunning!!
Your hair is so cute
Love your videos so much keep up the good work!💞🥰
Thanks for the upload. I would probably never go, so I’m glad you did.
This is so cool!! I love it!
This is so cool! I would love to go somewhere like that!
Ah, shoot!! Missed the deadline by 8 minutes 😞 Love your videos hope!!
Oh dang it i just missed the 30 minute mark

My daughter loves watching your videos and wanted to comment Hi.

Love you hope scope I was ready!
i love your videos (:
omg
love the video!
the store looks amazing
Oh wow need this store here too
Interesting concept! I wonder if this will stick - it seem slike some of Amazon's other retail spaces have wavered in interest / popularity.
What a cool concept!! I hate carrying things around!
I love the idea but I feel like there was many flaws that need to be fixed.
wait everyone’s comment is early- am i-
Hey
🤍
This is cool
Love this concept!
💕💕💕
Soo cute!!
I'm late. Lol I didn't comment within the first 30 minutes. Oops
On the fence about that store.  I would get very frustrated at the clothing not available to try on.
:0
Love the store but its good that they have only qr reader at entrance not with every single item.. which is quite irritating ... But vedio is cool i love it
Wsp
I love hopescope! I'm very happy I found you keep up the great work
This is so cool! So futuristic. I would love to be able to shop here
This is every husband’s worst nightmare 😂 Wives everywhere are plotting an Amazon getaway but it’s not to any rainforest 😂😂 Only rain will be in the form of dolla dolla bills 💵💵💵 Ok that was my last joke lol but this is really so cool! I’m jelly, definitely on my list of cool things to do once my kids are like just old enough to not burn the house down
love you queeeen
Hey,
Addicted to your videos
Am I too late😔
This is so cool to see!

Heyy
Happy saturday! My daughter and I love your videos, you have such an uplifting attitude and I never feel badly for not being your typical follower, thank you for that 😊
Shout I think I’m too late, dang!
These videos make me wanna buy really bad things for me to never wear! lol
I'm really curious if more of these stores will open in different states
This looks too cool
I love your videos!!!!!
Oh my word Amazon physical store 🎉

Omg I wish I could go there it looks so fun🥰🥰
Awsome!

This is an interesting concept with only one store, it's likely a pilot to work out the kinks.

Hi
Such a fun video!

Hi Hope. I just want you to know how much I love your channel. I've been watching all your videos and it entertains me A LOT with how brutally honest you are with these brands. You're my literally favoriteeeeee YouTube ever. Lots of love.
online shopping was created so that we wouldn't have to go out now amazon has a store 😳
…
Ahhh I’m late!!
I'm late...
I think literally I’m a minute too late
Love it!!!
I love the idea of this but it seems to have its flaws. I enjoy these kinds of videos!
Me pls
I'm going was it crowded?

Nice !
Done
Your hair looks amazing!!!!!
heyy i live your videos
FUN!

Ayeeee

Looks like an Awesome place
This looks like a great way to shop, so much more convenient.
love your videos!!!!
This looked like a fun experience.  It did seem like it has flaws but It will probably get better as they go, hopefully.  Thank you for doing this.  What a fun shopping day.
I had no idea that this was going to become a thing! So cool that you got to experience this :)
I wanna go to that store
Hiiiii
hello
This seems like such a cool idea! I'd love to go there. I hate the dressing rooms at stores
2 minutes late!
That looks like such a cool idea. 🤭
What a fun video! I can’t believe this is a real thing. I’ll have to check it out 🌈
i hope theres one in london
Super cool concept!
Love the video!!! Ugh I watched within 30 minutes but was getting out of the house and didn’t comment intime! Hopefuls forever! 💜
seems stressful
love this content!!!!!!!!!!!
35 minutes wooooo! So early
This is so cool!! Wish they had one in Jersey
I love ur videos🔥😂
Cool store!
I love Amazon I that store is beautiful I want to go there
The last dress was my favorite ♥️
The dressing room system seems pretty cool!
This looks crazy
this is really exciting
This is really cool! But practical...? I would still go to this shop tough!
Wait a minute.. FIRST store for CHEAP?
This would low key stress me out because whenever I’m shopping and the associate asks to prepare a room, I panic lolol
Hi
Love it!
You make it so cool to interact with you cuz you the only one that I will watch when your notifications come up
I love the idea of this store. The execution not so much.
This looks super cool!!! Amazon’s control is kind of scary though 😅
I love this idea, Amazon wins again. 🏆
The concept is nice but the execution is lagging tho
I think I could go shopping like this lol
The store looks cool and the shopping amazing. Love the clothes you picked out especially the last dress.
👀👀👀👀
ur so pretty 🤩🤩🤩
So fun!
Awesome video, they are always appreciated.
Love seeing the American stores.
omggg amazon is the best❤❤
OMG!! A magic closet 🤣😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😻😻
This seems like a really fun and interesting shopping experience, This idea could really develop and maybe even spread to other stores! Thanks Hope!
You ROCK Hope!! Another fabulous video!! I wonder if you can link your own cart from your phone so you can try on?? I always have a cart full of clothes that I can’t decide how it would look on me. Thank you again!! 🦋💙🦋💙🦋
Nice!
that store is so cool and organized :)
This is amazing
This is so interesting!! Really cool concept. First thing that comes to mind is that I never have full services in places like this, I feel like no reception might derail their whole concept. Interesting to see where this will go!
I went yesterday but ended up not going in.
The future is the present now
I am done i have subscribed, like and share also
Looks like fun
Amazing
❤ I am in love with you channel
id love shopping like this
I would love to visit here
Hey Hope, does it count that I opened the video when it said that it was uploaded 28 minutes ago? 🤔😅 Love your honest opinions
This is crazy?
this is very cool but i would like for it to have everything like the jeans to try on
I like how your stuff just appears in the dressing room for you.   Tbh I also loved the audible gasp when you saw the activewear section. It was adorable :-)
lowkey i would love to go here LMAO
I would shop there easily.
Love not carrying all my stuff too
Shopping like that is sooo satisfying:D
This looks like the fitting rooms from the future, it looks amazing! I wonder if it will only be available in the states though or if it would hit Europe at some point. Thanks for sharing the experience, Hope!
I wonder if they have a limit of customers in stores or you would have to make an appt ahead of time?
I would love to go this
hope there will be one in Asia soon!
Just 29 min late  like:done Already subscribe❤ Want gift card☺
I love all your videos
hiiii 60 minute drill :)
Hi xx
I’m only 4 minutes late 😭😭
Reformation started doing this a little while ago - I think it’s so fun!!
i love your vids soo much
I wonder how many of these stores will in each state in a few years? Also I agree with you what’s the point of clothes being on display but not getting to try them on because they don’t have them? I definitely think the store will improve and get some of the flaws fixed. Also the dressing rooms…… a dream! Looks like a walk in wardroom! Also this comment is my to hopefully get the gift card. Also I agree with you I don’t like the workers saying how are you doing like, I get anxious on what to say. I don’t know if would want all stores to be like this though would you? Love your channel!
Love
My favorite part was the dressing rooms. The actual store seems a little overwhelming.
Hey
I'm 31 minutes late can I still win lol 😂😂😂
The fitting room idea is cool.
Hi
omg I would love to go here, if only it wasn't across the country from me :(
This is so neat I hope they make more of these stores soon. Thank you for ok much for showing us. I think ur so great and ur so beautiful.  Keep doing u beautiful 😘

I like this idea but it definitely needs some tweaking
The store seems very convenient but kinda dystopian
Seems a bit more complicated 🤣 but I’d definitely visit if there was one near me.
I honestly didnt even know that an amazon store was a thing 😐I love how you make these videos entertaining and not boring 👍💞
I have one minute left to comment 😏

I love how u explore new  technologies  in fashion   Lovee youu hope Big fan
It looks like such a cool experience
It looks so fun. Love your videos!!
It's only one store in America though...maybe they are testing before spreading them to the whole country and later the whole world. They are taking over, scary thought!

Very interesting shopping experience!
So interesting!

It will be a long time before a store like that lands in my little town but it looks like it is a lot of fun plus great deals
Looks really cool. I hope they open up more stores across the state's because I would love to shop at one of these places
Love your videos Miss Hope!
It's super cool that Amazon opened a store!! and also a great idea. Really love your honest review. Thank youuu ❤

I love this concept and enjoyed your video and the flaws lol
Oof! This is crazy. Felt like I was experiencing this myself. Thanks so much Hope.
Made it before the 30 min 🌝  Pew
the light pink one would've been better than the purple with your hair!! you can pull off any colour though
This was so cool!
This looks nice, I want to go!
🤍🤍🤍
Hope this comes to more locations, could be cool!!
This is something interesting 😅
omg i love this idea!! like same day shipping to the next level

This is such a cool store 😃
This seems so cool! Im moving at the end of june and I would love an amazon giftcard to decorate my new apt a little 😊
Really interesting shopping experience!
Fun!
Love your videos this seems like a cool way to shop Amazon  or just things sent to you to have to send it back if it doesn’t fit makes me think of their try before you buy option too
we love your channel. always look forward to what your doing and so fun to see the try on.
Btw cool idea for a video
Very interesting store I love watching you go to all these new places so cool!
The store looks really cool!!! I like how you can chose when to get your dressing room.
I finally made it here early 😌 this video was super informative!
You do the coolest videos. The most mundane things are captivating when you talk about it.
gotta check this out next time I'm in Cali! Imma spend some $ 😁
Hello! Nice video!
I would loveeee to go here! 😍😍
Wait wat 😳💗 it's just like 29 mins but look at her views like and comment gooshh 😳💗🥂
i am obsessed with this
You’re always ahead of the game. I feel like no one knows about these stores. It makes your videos fun and interesting to watch!
I absolutely love the concept of this store!!
Maybe some of the larger empty department stores in malls have a chance now! Looks like fun!
That sunset dress is perfect.
This is so high tech but I like it less than normal stores
cool store!
It seems like a great concept and I’m sure soon it will be even better once they get the feedback and flaws dealt with. I kinda wanna go now lol!
Uh I was waiting for your review on this! :)
Love you!!!
I love the pink dress, you look very beautiful in it.
This is so cool! I hope they will open more of them 🙂
I would love to find 2 pairs of jeans that I like. Love the first grey sweatpants you tied on. Already added to my wishlist.
Love u hope
This sounds like such a fun shopping day!!
Trying on is definitely one of the main reasons to go to an actual store
Hey just watched the video!
idk how i feel about this but the room being ready for you is pretty cool honestly! i hope i win that amazon card😂
Omg did I make it intime for the gift cards
This looks really cool I wonder if they will bring it to Canada 🇨🇦
i hope i can find my right size because up until now that im 27 years old i got to find my size in the kid section! that’s why im having a hard doing shopping
Loved this video! An Amazon store is honestly so interesting. I wonder how quickly they will expand. Keep up the great work!!
30 mins ago wow
I would love too go there! I love shopping in store but with a new baby it might be awhile till I could ever get there. Also thanks so much for my mother's day video. I will admit it made me cry cause ur videos have helped me through so many sleepless night breastfeeding. Thanks for ur sunny bright out look on life. It really makes a difference for people around u when they r having a tough time! Have a great day!
that dressing room is so amazing!
This is so cool!!
🤗🤗🤗 oooo I definitely need an Amazon gift card! 🙏🏽
Heyyyy you are one of the best YouTubers and u are so entertaining to watch keep doing what you do
I would honestly try to go here but it is so far
Please let this still count!!
amazon gift card?? :)
I have never heard of this...seems interesting. Very practical that they send the stuff to the dressing rooms.
Loved this video! This shopping experience was really something different. I always enjoy watching your reviews, keep up the good work!
Heyy
Almost the future but not quite...💕the hair
It’s so cool how your up to try anything and everything for your own fun and for us hopefuls to get a chance to see how it’s like! Love you so much for doing this Hope! 😇😇
absolutely loved that dressing room experience! ♡
This seems like a cool idea, shame so much wasnt available to try on
Hiii
This looks really interesting! I wonder if this is going to be in New York or Atlanta anytime soon?!🤔😆
now i want to go here😩
I love your videos 😭😭❤️
hey
Hi I love its
I feel like this would be such a cool experience to atleast try!!!
sbdbhcg
woof
This is so crazy. Thanks for showing us.
Hi hope! This is a crazy store. I have seen Amazon grocery stores that are just as high tech. I wonder which is more disappointing seeing an item in store and looking through the rack to find they don’t have your size, or scanning the QR code and seeing it’s not available for try on/not in stock. 😂😂
I love it!!!
This an interesting concept. Nice vid
Love this!!!
Hello from spain!
Hi hope love your video
Hello, my name is Alana I love your videos hope especially the ones where you buy those auction boxes and I live in Florida so I’m super far away from California so it would be in the world if you gave me those hundred dollar gift cards thank you bye
That store looks so cool! The whole idea of scanning the codes is so creative
Interesting way of doing it... I just don’t see the scanning as practical lol. Anyways hey! I’ve been watching your channel for a few years and I have become more informed to say the least!
Love it, hopefully it'll come to Italy too.
An experience like no other. Would love to try this!
This is so Cool!!
it was  different yet interesing expiriance. I dont think it Will be something that Will stick around its too much but still its New
Seems strange to not have things in stock.  But I do like the loading the dressing room
Amazon is taking over the world but hope is taking over the internet.
What an I te resting experience.
I love your videos!!! What an awesome store.
That's so cool! Love your vids
That store is so futuristic and cool!
hi
Choose me please 😩💗
I literally love HopeScope
subscribed , liked and commented under 30 min  yassssssssss
I wonder if it would be hard for you to determine your size in certain jeans if the only size in store was 00 and you’re a size 8.
i love these kinda videos they keep me motivated keep doing what your doing 🫶
I feel like it would be nice if other shops would do smth similar to this amazon shop, l feel like it's way more comfy and just more cosy. It looks like great experience though!
Hey hope!! I am loving the pink in your hair honestly it looks so good
This looks like a cool way to shop.
This seems like a very convenient store that I want near me lol. I love the fact that you try literally everything for us so we can see your experience and know if something is good or not. Your so amazing 🙂🙂
This is super cool, but at the same time I’m not sure how I really feel about it. Especially when Amazon returns are so easy anyway 🤷🏼‍♀️
Oohhh this is pretty neat
I would like to have a amazon gift card
This seems like a good idea but what if the the qr codes stoped working??
This is so cool!
Hello HopeScope
This store looks so cool  and interesting. It definitely needs improvement but overall isn’t bad. You picked out some very nice pieces.❤️
Yes I would love to go to this store lol soo much better than looking through racks of clothes just to find out they don’t have your size
<
Wow I'd love to go!
just bought the leggings ❤
Commenting because I'm accidently early! Your videos are always so fun.
This is soo cool! I really want to got there
Loved this!!
Hi love you
An amazon store?! Is this the future?
I love all of ur videos!!! (And would rly love that gift card…)
This feels overwhelming. Lol
Hi hope me and my sister love your videos!!
Hope you looked so amazing in everything you got
That looks so cool. I cannot imagine not carrying my stuff though, I feel like I would immediately forget everything I’d send to the dressing room and end up with like a million things to try on lol. Love your content!!
I want this in Belgium 😭😭
Pick me
Ngl I’m scared to go here
Hello hopeful!!!
Haha 29 mins 😂
Ok I love the whole scan & it waits in the room for you!!! Not even luxury retailers do that!
That store is amazing. Especially the dressing room. Being able to get a different size clothes without leaving the room is cool
Heyyy i want me some gift carddd 🥰
This store is awesome
Not sure about this store 🤣
I want to shop there so bad! It looks so fun 🤩
This is cool but I don’t know if I would like it 🤔
I love this store, looks really interesting
i love this!!!
What a cool idea! Other than not being able to try on half the jeans 😂 love your videos hope, always a banger when you post!! 🖤
I want to go to one! I loveee your hair btw 😍
As someone who works on computers for retail All I can think is that this would be technical nightmare if it went down.
i justlove your videos <3
This is a really cool store and it looked so organized just wish it had more options with trying stuff on. I love how you bought a plane ticket just so you could make this video :)
This looks very cool! I wonder if it will gain enough traction to open up more stores elsewhere?
Let's GO
I didn’t even know that this was a thing. Thanks for the video! Such a fun shopping experience 😁
Such a cool idea
Would be an interesting experience as I don't like to shop online but do like to shop in a shop but that online you find more interesting cheaper things but can't buy it if I don't feel it 😂
This is awesome and I hope I win. You're amazing hope.
hey
Love the idea of this! Wonder how long before more stores do this 🤔
This is so cool🔥🔥🔥🔥 I just love your content 😍😍
Omg I’m early for the first time ever.
The one thing I love about this is that they prepare the dressing room for you so you do not have to carry all of the clothes around.
Hi hopeeee
Looks good for online shopping  with a instore personalized feel , no judgment or interruptions from dressing room attendants Yay!
it looks so luxurious and pretty. It is incredible how you have a ton of privacy and how it's delivered to you. It's like a store of the future.
This is really cool. I like the online and physical mixture.
Love the technology aspect of the dressing room
I wish to win the give away from india
I will definitely check it out when I'm there
well I'll be damn, Amazon done stepped all the way up! 🥳🥳🥳❤️
This is cool
I would love to shop there!
I’d love a gift card 😍😍😍😍
I would love to win have been subscribed for a while
Subscribed! Liked! Before 30 mins...would love me an Amazon gift card❤🥺
I wanna go
👋
This is actually a fun concept. Hopefully they improve it.
Oh my goodness I love your videos!! ❤️
I dont shop in Amazon but seeing your video makes me wanna try it out 🤭 hopefully I have a chance to have more $$$ to try🤯
Interesting!!  I stopped the video so can't wait to see your final thought!!
This looks so fun!
It would be so nice to have and amazon style in my country hnggg
Such a fun video!
I SOOOOO HOPE I WIN THIS TIME!!! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! GLAD YOU WENT EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T UP TO HOSTING YOU!!!
You are great! I don't subscribe to much,  but had to finally give in today.
This is so cool!
this looks so cool! i would love to try it out, Amazon is amazing!
Omg this is so cool
Can't wait to take my daughter here!!💕
yassss
Just saw the dressing rooms 😁
I love how you test everything for us!  I wish I could go to all these places, but living vicariously through you is better for my wallet lol.  Your hair is making me wanna go back to red...hmmm...do I dare?
I love your videos so much
They have a new try before you buy concept on Amazon too. It lets you try clothes for 7 days and then you send back what you don’t want. Then it charges you for only what you keep!
That’s one of those concepts that’s fun when it’s new but people will quickly get bored and it will eventually flop. It’s needlessly complicated.
Hello gorgeous
I love ur energy hope u make my day!
My liking this concept conflicts with my fear of Amazon
I never knew Amazon had a store
Yo
I love your video you put so much work ty so much for the vids
Love you and your contents Hope! ❤ definitely makes me want to go to one of their stores!
Heyy i love all of your vids❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and also i love they grey dress its so pretty 🤩
I wanna go!!! What a cool experience!!! Also, hi Hope :)
This is something that I would try once to say I did it. Loved the video!!
This seems like a great idea, but it looks like the execution might need a little more work
This is going to be something other online companies will start
I love your videos! I just discovered your videos a couple weeks ago and I'm obsessed! Your upbeat, cheerful attitude makes your videos so fun to watch! On top of your videos being fun you also give us all the info we need to potentially buy the same items. Thanks for all you do!
i wanna wiiin
Your awesome
Fun.
What an odd shopping experience.
You always give the best videos
This is sick and absolutely love the hair!
Wow that is so futuristic
Hi I would just like to say that I LOVE your videos and it just makes it so much more clear of what is worth it
this looks so bougie lol
this should be prepared better ahahah
25 minutes in! 🤣❤️
Woo! I was so afraid I was gonna sleep too late and miss out 😂
Hope I just lovvve the top by the way.
nice video
This looks different. Love your videos 💛💛
Love your videos !!!! 🤍🤍
That 2 floor was kind of shocking like their technology just screams future ! And that blue dress that u tried on was the cutest thing everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr💖💖💖
I loved the video and I didn’t even know that they were making an Amazon store, but that’s cool. Keep doing what your doing because I really enjoy your content!💗
LOVE THIS SM
Was there a shoe section? I wonder how many locations they will have. Love the concept. They should have an option where you can say you’re ready for a dressing room.
Hope they open up more stores! Love the try on process.
IM EARLY OMG
This looks so fun!
Hope they open more stores!!
Hiiii! I absolute love your channel!
I so appreciate your videos because you never sugar coat anything , it’s nice seeing honest reviews for brands !!
LOVE this concept
I would love to go to one of these store but I lovenin ohio and there's nothing around me 😆
Your new fan !
Okay, and that magic closet 🤯
I've never even heard of this. Thanks for sharing your experience with us. I would love an amazing gift card. Good luck to everyone and good luck on passing KK in subscribers.
yayyyyy nice
Oh! I'm still in the 30 minute window! Yay! Lolol. This is really fun. I live near burbank so definitely looking to make a trip there. Also in desperate need of good fitting jeans.
this is super interesting idk about its legitimacy though
I understand why there might not be everything there to try on, but if I am shopping in person, I want to try it on. I do love how new items are delivered to the dressing room.
Even though I’m 20 years old I still need fashion tips and you nail that.
For an introvert like me, the shopping experience is ruined by the fact that I have to interact with people. So if these shops pop up everywhere, I'll be the happiest
Hi ❤️ ur videos they always make my day
I haven’t heard of this…good thing you are here to test it out for us!
i Hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
The one per item thing is cool unless you’re between sizes and always need to grab two of everything to try 😅
I need an Amazon gift card!
Love your video’s
I feel like this idea is pretty good, but I can't imagine the extra work the employees might have (but at the same time it might be easier than having a mountain of clothes to put back in the hangers and then the racks for display idk)
Looks so fun, shame the UK doesn't do something like this other the Amazon grocery in London x
You are my most favourite youtuberrr 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Wow I loved this idea very futuristic as you said💕 Love all your videos always refreshing the feed for you 😍
I would love to know what you recommend for travel.
This is amazing... I need to go to Cali!!!
love your videos!! and Amazon 💓
Hi
Yassssssssssss love the videos 🖤
might have to book a flight just to see
Yayyyyy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loved seeing the experience and makes me wanna fly out and give it a try lol
Experience  vlog + the try on haul - hell yeah !
Ohhh my god u dmmmm real 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤌🏻
TURN UPPP!!!! 24 min!!!
Interesting stuff!
I like the idea of an Amazon store, but it does seem to have some flaws.
The jeans section seems super chaotic and it gives me a bit of ✨anxiety ✨
Good morning!!. Hope to win a gift card!!
I got another Amazon ad YouTube is still sus
Such a cool experience!
Hi
This is soooo cool😎😎 Hope you are the best!! Can’t wait to visit this store✨
This video is a cool experience
As someone who hates carrying a bunch of clothes around while I shop, this is the coolest idea! Unfortunate they had flaws, but it’s a good start for sure!
I don't know how I feel about this store! Awesome video though!
I'm on 23 mint 😅not bad right but I'm so far it's not gonna work if I won too 😖
amazing video
i hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
I’m in love with your channel you make me so happy! You don’t upload too much to where I don’t like watching you, you upload just enough! And I’m so happy I would hate to be tired of you
I LOVE YOUR VIDES HOPE!!!!
This looks so fun!(:
Can I win a Amazon gift card please
Hi hope I have latterly fell in love with your videos and I would really love to win the Amazon gift card and I am in the first 30 mins of the viedo
💜
love u hope i love ur videos
Yass! Love you so much. Wish there was something like this closer in Texas.
Done
This is soooooo cool 🤣🤣
What a fun shopping experience !! I had no idea this even existed! Thanks so much for sharing the info and the stuff you picked out was 🔥!   It looked great on you! Makes me want to go shop immediately!! Can’t wait to see next time you go- you could totally just make videos on that alone ! Thanks again !
Hello ^^
HI

iHope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
Yay made the 30 minutes just!
😎👍
I like ur videos I’ve seend almost every one:))
Love the concept of the store but nah. Lol 😂 I’m glad to see a new episode up!
...
I love this store! Im in seattle but they dont have one here yet:(
This is so cool!! how come i’ve never heard of this????
wow! this looks so cool! what an awesome experience!
My kind of store.
This is cool in a way, but not too sure 😁
Hey
This place seems so cool thanks for the video!
I absolutely love the videos you make hope!! 🥰🥰
This looks like a really cool experience
Hi
This is so cool!!
i Hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
This looks awesome. If the jeans worked it would’ve been perfect
I love you videos!
I get really nervous about shopping on Amazon due to quality and different sellers so I think this would be a fun experience to try!
OMG I can't wait for the day that all dressing rooms are like that! What an experience!!
Hey Hope . Love watching your videos at work .. sending love from Kenya🇰🇪🇰🇪
PLEASE GIVE ME A GIFT CARD:)
this looks so cool, props to hope for trying out anything and everything new we might be interested in :))
it looks so interesting, but like idk how i feel about them having a store..?
Omg I wanna go there!! Love some Amazon
Hi Hopeeee!!!!
That is so cool
This is amazing. Thanks for the awesome experience!
this looks so cool!
So close to missing the 30 minutes was 23 minutes 🤣🤣🤣
The jeans🥰🥰🥰
I love this idea!
We love ya ❤, keep it up!!! This video was really cool.
This seems so cool! Love the vids!! ❤❤
I feel like this is a bit too futuristic for me 🫠
HI HOPE I LOVE YOU
I definitely need to visit this store 👏🏻
This looks like such an interesting idea, I would love it if more stores were like this. It allows the brand to showcase way more styles, way more neatly.
You are so FUN to watch! 😊
pick me hope!!
So cool I love your vids very entertaining
I could use a Amazon gift card for formula since none of my stores near me have much 😐
hey Hope <3
Heyyyy I’m early!!!!
i Hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
I really like how all her videos are so thoughtful and different every time, it makes her videos so much more enjoyable!
It seems like a really fun experience but I hate trying on clothes 😅  especially at the store.
Kinda cool but weird at the same time! It's a starting point for sure!
This store seems very cool I loved the design
Hi!
It will be interesting to see what they learn from this concept and what it looks like in a year or so.
Hello hope and leo this video was so cool but Amazon is really just going to take over the world
crazy how fast technology evolves in the fashion world too, still super cool
Interesting concept but with sizes varying so much between brands I would want to see them so I can choose which size I want to try, tricky when you have a curvier shape.
It would be nice to not have to carry things around the store 🤔
I need to check this place out!
Thanks for another fun video!!! 💖🌸  This seems “logical”. I hate buying clothes from Amazon because my body shape is just… difficult. Certain items MUST be tried on, but mostly, pants. Bane of my existence. I’m surprised we don’t have one of these in Seattle. 🤔
i Hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
Omg heyyyyyy this is so cool
Oooo I’m here before 30 mins :) great vid as always!
If you’re looking for a good pair of jeans PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEEASE go to an Ariat store. Russell’s Western stores carry lots of Ariat denim, usually. Please check them out. I promise you will leave the store with your new favorite jeans that actually look really good! You are welcome! 💁🏼‍♀️✨
This is a cool idea!
I LIKED SUBBED AND LIKED AND COMMENETED
SO COOL HOW IT SENDS ITEMS TO A DRESSING ROOM!! What an interesting experience :)
What brand was the leggings? I know you’ve tried on a ton from Amazon but I can’t remember which one you liked the most.
looks cooolll
This is crazy!!! So cool though!!
Is there anything Amazon isn’t doing… I think there taking over the world. Slightly concerned 😳
I had no idea about this store!! Such a good idea - those fitting rooms are SO nice!!
I love Amazon it’s my happy place
this store would be so cool to visit omg
Hhhhhiiii hope I love your videos I can’t wait to get pink hair like you !!!
Love this! But a little disappointed in lack of availability in items! Thank you for taking us along!
Lots of love for you, thanks for doing the experience, so we don't have to 😂🙏🏼❤️
Loving the video !!!😍😍 Such a cool idea !!
im here!
This is amazing!!
That’s so cool. I wished we didn’t have to carry all our clothing which was definitely a plus on the store :)
Idk how i feel about this store ! 😂 Amazon is everywhere ahahah
This looks cool enough to try though!!!
I love this concept for a store
Love this vidio was so fun,❤️
This seems an interesting experience!
I like the style of the shop
Donee
great video
I love your videos 🥰
I love the concept of the store, but it seems they need to work out some kinks. I always thought stores should use this kind model
I think it's a cool idea but definitely kinda strange
What a great idea!!
I love your videos ❤️
looks cool
So cool! I can see a lot of people going just for the experience 😍
Woohoo! Love this!
Omg, so glad you did a vid in that store! So interesting how they do it all! Great jeans 👖!
❤
This legit looks supercool I can’t believe we don’t have this in the UK i am kinda scared about Amazon taking over everything
Wow!!!! I need to go to this store
Love the new store.  Love Amazon!
I'm in first 30 minutes 😎😎😎😎
I have no idea how to feel about this - is it really more convenient than just going to a store?? Either way, thanks for checking it out for us!!
Seems like a very futuristic store, super cool
i love the dedication that you put in all of our videos!
i Hope i win BC i need moey lol ps Ur videos are so unique ❤️❤️
Loving the video!! Amazon truly is taking over haha
you fun and pretty
This experience looks incredible!! It looks like a could spend a whole day here and your telling me everything goes the dressing room for me?! This is exactly what I need to go shopping in. Thank you so much HopeScope for another entertaining immersive video ❤️
I love how truthful you are in these videos! It really makes me trust what you say and your experience as a normal shopper compared to being sponsored by the store. Props to you for spending your money for us!
Please pick me I love your videos and I want to by more  leggings but I don’t have money
I ❤️ Amazon AND HopeScope!!!!
I love Amazon! Wish I could go here
What an experience! Definitely for the younger generation. I couldn't see my mom going to this store. She would be so lost! Regular stores how dare them
How awesome is this ?????? I wanna go experience this !! Thank you for the video ! 🥰🥰🥰
This looks amazing
Yeah, new video!
I don't know how I feel about this. I mean, it's definitely a unique experience but I still really hope it won't become the norm in the future. I may be old fashioned but, even without taking into account the technical issues, IMO it takes away from the whole fun/messy shopping experience, makes it too automatic and perfect. It's like shopping online but with the added feature that you still have to get off your ass to do it
Loved this!!! Always get excited when I see a new upload❤️
I think it’s more complicating then traditional shopping but it’s look fun and I think it’s a pretty good experience
your the besttttttttt
I wonder isn't there like Amazon warehouses all over the US? Could there possibly be one near this store that holds all the sizes of the clothing they have in store? IDK just an idea :P
This is so neat!! I would totally go if one opened near me. Those dressing rooms are sick
Love your content!!
Love it ❤️
This look so cool....
Sooo cool, love your videos. Can I get the gift card pleaaaaase?
I was watching hope scope video at 9:30 then I went to the toilet at 10:30 when I came back it was already too late😭
😊 i really enjoy seeing your videos Desde México 💞
That is so cool!!! That is such a unique way to shop!
You've given me lots of ideas on where to go next year (me and my future husband are coming to the US for our honeymoon.
This amazon store is really cool!
Delaware has nothing i wish we had this.
Waittttt I neeeeed to go here lol this is great for my anxiety. I need more stores like this lmao
Luv luv this!! 🌸💕🌺💐🌼
This is such a cool idea for a store! I’ve been trying to find a perfect summer dress 👗 would love to win the Amazon card
Very cool store..and you look amazing
this was such an innovative idea,!
Definitely an experience! Wow!!!
Super interested 👀 I wish it wasn’t just in California!
Hi Hope! 😊 Thank you for giving away gift cards! They can make such a difference for folks! 💛
I'm happy I've till the very end before asking where's Leo
I would love to win amazon vouchers! X ♥
Way out of my budget
This looks so cool
Why was that blue dress three hundred dollars like bra
This is so cool and futuristic! Love this video!
Hello
Hey I love you hope
Seems cool. Like the best of both worlds.
Thanks for another awesome video! Can't wait to see what you do next ❤
Sometimes I don't get why everything has to become digital. I think it would be faster to just walk in, get it off the hanger and try it on. But it does look pretty cool
This is so cool. I live in Arkansas and I could not imagine lol I almost want to send my older family there just to record their reaction 😂 my husband and I still have to show our families how to use their WiFi... and turn their phones on silent. They would flip at the technology.
whoooooa! def checking this when i go in Oct!
Early squaaaad! ♥️
Thanks for reviewing for us!!
I’m not sure how I feel about this store, but I love the idea of having a changing room prepared for you and not having to tote around tons of clothes.
hiiiiiiiiiiii
hi
Hello from France 🇫🇷 we're not used to seeing this kind of videos and this is why I really love it ! you are inspiring, vibrant and stunning !! Bisous de Paris !
Kinda lame with the jeans situation! I totally have the same problem finding jeans that fit and are comfortable and it’s already like so emotionally taxing to shop for them haha.
i barely made the cut!! haha
I honestly love your videos ur so beautiful x
All of the cool places are millions of miles away from me 😩🤣, I might be being a little dramatic lol. This is really cool though. Shopping made easier 👍🏼
I absolutely love watching new Hope videos. She is such a beautiful woman inside and out. Wow, totally cool concepts but definitely a little unnerving how much they use learning software to figure out how to personalize/stalk information about yourself.
Hi
Lets goooo i am somewhat early!!!! Hope I love your videos and it helps me out with where and what to buy so thanks for putting in effort to make videos like this<333
Okay, I MUST go!!! I’m obsessed with this concept. Thanks for sharing!
Such a neat concept! Haven’t seen anything like this before. Thanks Hope!
I love this !
I don’t know if I love this or hate this. Amazon kind of scares me, but it’s so convenient! Okay wait, now that I see the dressing room…. I’m on board!!
So cool! Amazon is taking over though
This is so fun ❤❤
Love your videos 🥰🥰🥰
I definitely want to check this store out! It looks super cool! I love you girl!
the store is so cool, it really just combined online and physical shopping.
lol l wanna go now very interesting
Love your videos!  You keep everything so real and attainable.  Great role model for the younger generation. 💕🙃
This is soooo cool 😂😁
My goal is to go to the Amazon store this month. So cool to have a sneak peek 🫣
This is really so cool, I hope they expand these stores!
This store is crazy!!n
Wow I would love to have this in Canada!
how I wish .... please pick me. 😘😘😘
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
This concept seems really cool, gives the vibes from online shopping but you get to try it before buying
Can I get the gift card please.
This store looks so fun! Wish they opened one where I live ☺ great video as always!!
okay the magic closet is too cool
woah
wow, already so many comments. I was trying to think of something OG to say, but I have a brain fart.
Weirdddd Amazon taking over
Love your energy and content in every video. Wish you all the best.
Love you Hope! Watching you just brings me so much joy :)
LOVE Amazon!! Thank you for sharing this!!
I've never heard of such a thing, thanks for having us tag along with you Hope! I was impressed with the attention to detail. especially in the fitting room.
Great vid as usual. Love you Hope 😍 let's go Hopefuls
Love the video!
i love your vids it says this video was posted 21 minutes ago so i hope i made it😅
done
This is more convenient for easy and fun shopping trip
love your vids Hope. always love watchig. ❤
Posted 20 min ago and already 11k likes!!!!! WOAH!!!!!!!!?👏♥️🙌👌
Hi I was getting worried that you had not posted for ages
Hello!!
me and a few of my friends are trying to start a business so that amazon gift card would help us a lot!! i would really appreciate it and i love watching all you reviews!
This is so cool!
Hmm I wonder if this will effect Amazon online in anyway
I really enjoyed this content! Thanks for sharing.
Love love love
I love Amazon.
Loving the hair and the store looks good few flaws but they will hopefully sort out the things u noticed
So cool but logisticly I think it will end up being a mess. Try Levi's jeans, they are decent quality, good price and fit curvy bodies well.
This is so cool 😎 it will also stop returns if you have already tried it on before leaving the store! I wish they had this in the uk 🇬🇧 i hope it comes soon! I hate shopping, i get hot and sweaty and really stressed out! So im in awe! Absolutely amazing, great video, and you look absolutely amazing in everything you wear! Xx ♥
Hey hope! I love your videos and look forward to them every time you post!! 💕💕
Had no idea this was a thing. :) I’d rather shop in store always. Thanks hope!
Very strange experience
We're living in the future lol
Literally made my day!! ❤️❤️
I have to say this kinda interesting
Omg I need to go there right now.
THE MAGIC CLOSET!
Wouldn't u still have issues with jeans, if u did when u order them....
i wanna win hiiii
Comment 🫡
i wish i had money to spend
I love your videos! I look forward every time a new video come out!❤️
I love this store omg! But also.... It's problematic?
My wife would love this place.
That dressing room experience is AMAZING. 😳 I can’t wait to try it one day!
I would love to go there someday
i need to go!!!
I have mixed feelings about Amazon 😅 but the concept of the store is cool
heeyyyyy this seems like an interesting idea but could use better execution
Wow, would love to visit that shop. Another great video, Hope!
Can’t wait to go!
Okay after watching, I would love to do this. Not have to talk to anyone?!? Sign me up!
This is kind of a fun concept. I’d go for it! Also… If you’ve ever been a dressing room attendant, thank you for putting all the clothes back! You are so appreciated!
It is seems like a good concept, but I wonder if people will keep coming once the 'new' goes away.
this is so cool !!!
Finally a store that will stay tidy all day long haha!
I think you should book flight to London in summer and go and rate the first ever physical Gymshark store they are opening :D
This is insane. Curious to see how it does and if they expand. Since it’s Amazon assuming it will.
It is such a cool store. i love your videos
I wanna go take me next time!! 😀
Amazing hope!!!
Great video as always. Maybe one day they will open one in Australia… at least we have Amazon online for the meantime!
This store looks amazing!! Thanks for entering me...I could definitely use a 100gc to Amazon...im due july 10th and still need so much stuff!💜💜💜
This is so futuristic
It’s a very creative idea of a shop!!!
Hello I love this store would love to shop here
I think I’m actually on time for once 🤗😩
I love your videos so much
Awesome video :)
I love you vids! Please send me a giftcard for amazon!
Love you HOPE , you give me Hope
It looks so cool but I’d be in so much debt 😂
Not me hopping that the store was in my area. Turns out that it is all the way across the country. Love u Hope 💓
seems confusing to me!
Hii i really love u 😍😍 u r so sweet
This looks pretty cool. If it comes to my country I would be down to try it out! It looks like it saves a lot on one's carbon footprint.
the whole shop looks so cool!!
love it!
Sending so much love! Have an awesome weekend :)
Idk if my comment worked. I FREAKIN LOVE YOU. I have to pay for my own locker. I dont have the money to buy it, please hope 🥹🥹 Your the best youtube and honest. I try to watch other reviews but they arent as good as yours.
Hope takes a plane to make us yet another amazing video!! 🤩🤩
I think this is kind of cool I would be interested in going but idk
Definitely an interesting concept! A few tweaks needed. I'm curious if there was an area for more plus size clothing though since looking at smaller sizes can be difficult for us to imagine the fit on larger bodies.
This is cool!
I love your videos. You are so beautiful 🥰
Ah yesssss I'm finally on time !!!! Lol loved this video!
Heyyyy
This store looks very interesting
Clicked in 14 mins of posting and went to see the video before commenting.....what should I feel abt that😅
That nah is so rude lol
Maybe I’ll have to check it out next time I’m in La!
That would be so fun! But trying on clothes is tiring 😂
Well that’s so cool! I wish I had a new Minnesota here! But yeah you are right that is a downside about not malfunctioning sometimes but otherwise it’s gonna cost me love your videos Hope!
as much as that dressing room is cool i feel like there were cameras everywhere in that store. i also wonder how shoplifting would work here
Am here for the Pink hair
This looks so cool!
i love your vids
Wow! Amazon is on a different level. Love this video!!
Wow, so crazy!
Very nice love from India
That’s really interesting.
hi
I love this idea! The experience seems fun!
This looks such a cool store. Wonder when they will have one in the UK
This actually seemed really fun! I feel like it would be such a fun place to go and online shop but also in store shop. The only problem that would really suck is with the jeans. I love jeans and would want to buy so many pairs but wouldn't be able to because of the try on and lack of them.
That’s so cool! I have strep and this is so fun to watch
Cool idea!
Cool concept for sure! Thank you Hope!!
this looks so cool and i love the honest reviews ❤❤❤❤
Frustrating they had stuff on the floor that wasn't available.  How many people actually work there? Thank you for the review Hope!! 💕
Love your videos Hope! Thanks for being a positive and kind person in a world of chaos! ☺️ Original scoper-sqad and a hopeful for life! ❤️ Keep being you, you're awesome!
Were is the amazon store?
All the clothes ar efitinnf you s-o nicee
You are amazing
This is so cool! Really a genius idea. They should probably glue the the QR code to the hanger.
Did I make it on time??  Lol
fun
Great video!
I AM HERE
This is a pretty cool concept. My issue with buying clothes off of amazon online is sizing, so this will cut down with having to return items
This seems pretty interesting, but also pretty strange 💀
I wish we had this in South Africa 😭
Another unique video….thanks Hope!
Not sure how I feel about this!! Good concept defiantly needs to have all of the items for try on and then it would work quite well!
Probably the only way I am going to step into a fitting room ever again
😱🥰
Absolutely interesting! I would love to see all the clothes and be able to try them on, this is a good alternative !
omg I love it
cool cool cool cool
This is awesome
Hi hope!
Ur the best!! 🎉💜 Thank you for doing the grunt work!!
Omg i love that although there are some flaws😆
it looks like it's much more fun to shop around using ur phone rather than a sales lady hounding you down.... (here in the philippines... sales ladies will keep on following you like a shadow... 😂😂😂)
Wow those dressing rooms are so cool! Thanks for trying it out, now I want to haha
Very cool.
I would love to have this in my city!! You always do the BEST content. Always looking forward to what you have next!!
This is the future of shopping!
The QR code idea is so cool!
I think the idea of this is all really cool but Amazon is TAKING OVER!! It was kinda weird that you couldn’t try some things on but overall rlly cool!
Sending love from Bahrain!
This is cool concept, but with a lot of mistakes. Hopefully it only get better
Love your videos❤
Love the idea, not sure I would actually enjoy the experience 🤔
I LOVED THIS VIDEO!
I love that u don’t have to carry all your clothes though the store
Love this!
This concept is pretty cool but I'm not flying anywhere just to visit a store. It will be interesting to see how well this store does in the future.
this feels so futuristic. i'd love to experience this kind of store...
this shopping experience would be pretty cool
Hi! Omg so futuristic Crazy how the world is advancing so fast!
I would spend so much time there!
This is so cool, I never knew they had this. I’m so happy you showed us this!
I wish they had this in South Carolina cause sure would have fun
This looks cauotic and cool!
🤞🤞
done done . I think I'm late 🫠
so cool
Love the concept!
Such a fun video 😍 I would really like to visit this store one day, so futuristic! ☺️
I am subscribed and commenting within 30 minutes and I am very hopeful 😂 also I love your videos and you’re like making everything so entertaining I want to be your friend🫠
I get the whole idea its kinda futuristic! I would also feel way more comfortable in those dressing rooms 😁
Love your videos and love Amazon ahahhaha
Such a cool concept! Thanks for taking us with you :)
Love your vids
It looks so amazing, I wish this facility will available in my country too
Cool store
I NEED a MAGIC CLOSET IN MY HOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey I love your videos

your hair always looks good in every video like??? how???
I'd love to check out this store.  Great video
Omg! My shopaholic heart needs to visit this store, it looks so cool
Wow it's kinda fun to watch ❤❤❤
I don't know if this will blow up like Amazon fresh, guess we'll see!
This looks like so much fun! Love watching your videos. They always make me smile
Omg love your videos
I have a love/hate relationship with this concept.
Love this shopping video!! Hope you're the best!
hiii i'm done
I think amazon should just stick to the online store but it’s cool !!
This is such an interesting way to shop!
So interesting 🤔
This seriously makes me want to book a flight to CA
This looks so cool but the flaws
interesting concept. Thanks for checking it out!
This is such a great idea, thank you.
I would love to try Amazon in real life!
Loving this content!!
the store in itself  feels like a adventure.  love your videos
Love this idea!
This is wild!! I saw the store on Good Morning America a few weeks ago, and it is so cool to see someone actually going through the shopping experience!! Thanks for sharing Hope!!
I love your videos!! I would love to go to the Amazon store 💜💜
What a crazy experience.. everything is so cool..♥️
This is such a cool idea! I was wondering what you were up to in Cali 😉
Amazon really trynna integrate to the physical world!
I like all
Now I want to travel and check this out! Seems fun!!
I'm not late this time, I swear. A store like this would be so helpful in the UK though. I rarely buy clothing from Amazon because of sketchy reviews/images, so actually trying it on would make me reconsider.
The way they combined online shopping and in store shopping is awesome, it’s futuristic, love your videos God bless ❤️
This is cool! I hope you enjoyed your flight.  And yes go looking like a forever 21
This looks so awesome!
Interesting concept, but seems like it was a rough launch. Thanks for trying this out and showing us!
I’m not sure how I’d feel about their not having all the stuff there available to try on but it’s cool all the variety they do have.
The fact that you went to California just for us is pure dedication and awesomeness
I prefer shopping online but I believe that I would like to shop where my things are alredy in the fitting room!
That’s so cool I love your channel
I love you're hair
Love it 🥰
Looks soo cool
I wish we had a store like this over here in the UK I'd be in heaven
YES FINALLY FINALLY THE FIRST EVER AMAZON SHOP YEASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Hi im a fannnn
Hi
Hope you are always so positive and even find a way to make the negatives of a store or brand not sound so bad! The world needs more people like you! <3
They've got a bunch of cool ideas... I really loved this video 😍
Wow! This looks like so much fun! I can definitely see where technology could make things fail.
Give me the card hope, I could buy workout clothes!!!!
Despite the flaws, this is not bad for a first version of this type of store. I wonder if other stores will follow this model eventually.
It’s so cool how the barcodes work and linked to the account! Loving the pink outfit and hair🥹❤️ I hope they will open more stores!
that is so cool!! I love this channel!!
Really cool concept!!! Love the video!
This is cool. I've been curious about this!!
This is an interesting idea! I agree with another comment that Amazon is taking over 🤪
This looks so cool!
Yay new video!
I love this channel, been watching for years. LOVE IT
Thanks for doing so many giveaways!! I would love to win!!
I would need more than 10 items!
claim
I love your videos!
i <3 hopescope
Really would love to go to that place
This looks like it's more for show and not actually a customer friendly. smart and comfortable shopping experiencexD
Interesting!
Hi love you so much hope ❤️
The black is literally awesome and pink hairs will go good with iy
Thanks for this, Hope.
amazons my fave!!! looking for some jeans too!! :)))
Guys I actually made it in the first thirty minutes! That purple looks so good on you (:
Love ur videos. Always very interesting and u r funny.
Wow that’s super cool I wish that we had one here in Minnesota
hhhhhiiii
Not carrying around anything while you shop would be so amazing 👏 Perfect - I can try on more than my arms can hold :)) ! A 10 item limit per time does kinddda stink, but might keep me on schedule lol. Another fab video Hope !
What a cool concept. Shopping made easy! Thanks for the tour Hope!
Love this!! Can’t wait to visit an Amazon store.  Kind of weird if we’ve gone from in store shopping expanding into online retail…this is like the opposite - online to now in store haha
Idk if I like this or hate it
I legit need an amazon gift card, cause I've got clothes that I would like to wear this summer and for the new school year. Please HopeScope!!!
I want to go!!!!
This is a cool idea! I would like to try it out
I need this $100 card to help finish buying dorm stuff for my daughter! ❤️ love all your videos!
This really is a flawed system, isn't it 😅
This is amazing
Seems like a fun experience
so cool hope it comes to europe soon
This is awesome 😎
My daughter Stephanie and I love your videos.  You are so hilarious.  Her being 12 I have had a hard time finding something to bond with her .
I cannot wait to try those fitting rooms!!! I hope they have plus size! 🤞🏼
this is such a cool idea!! 22 minutes in!! good luck to everyone for the gift cards!! 💝
Love the video. What a different way to do some shopping.. the future of shopping for sure!
,Did you really enjoy this shopping experience?  It must have been frustrating to not be able to try on the jeans you wanted.  And only be allowed to select 10 items at a time to try on?  Hmmm....nice dressing room however.
So fun!!!
The dressing rooms are so futuristic 😮😮😮
let's appriciate that she booked a whole flight just for us
Uuuu this looks interesting  . The dressing rooms  look fancy 👀.
helloooooooo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;))))))))0;;);)
this might have some flaws but overall i like the store alot but i wishh there were more styles to pick on the app
thanks for the video hope!
Wow this is cool, you don’t have to check manually if your size is available. Very Techy!Nice dressing room.
Is it weird I wasn't surprised she booked an entire flight for a store?
Love this video!! Amazons amazing but really shows the flaws lol.
This is so cool! Those dressing rooms are awesome!
It seems like a good idea but it will take a while to work out the kinks
Wow, the hair is sooooo pretty! 🤩
Need to visit here asap 😍
looks so cool! how do you go about returning items? i would think it’s very similar like buying things on the app, or is it different because it’s from a store
🌷
Hi there! I absolutely love the concept of this store. I wish we had one here in South Africa. Have a great weekend :)
This seems like a good idea
So much fun
So cool 🥰
wonder what this is like for plus size folks? cant imagine walking through the whole store and not knowing whats in your size at all.
Cool.
That’s so cool!!! I wish they had one closer to me!!! That’s weird they didn’t have more options for try ons. The jeans are the most important!!!!!
I just love your hauls ❤️😍💞❤️
I like this idea - it’s super cool but I wonder how long it’ll be until other stores incorporate it :)
🌈💎
This looks sooo cool can they bring this to the UK!
awesomesauce! this is so cool. i can’t even. i hope the work out the kinks
Such a great vid Hope!!!
Amazon has replaced B&M and then became B&M
Wow this is so cool!😍 also so excited you uploaded today 🥰
Hilarious and genius…I think
This is so cool!
First it look like the best shopping experience!!!! 2nd....I so want to go!!! 3rd....great prices!!
Shopping like this seems wild. I've seen the grocery amazon idea and holy cow. It is a very cool way to shop
Heylo .
I seriously lmao at your dressing room experience, because that’s exactly mine too!!!! I’m totally want to twin with you ❤️
The store looks soooo coool would love to visit!
Hi Hope!  Love your videos!! Please keep them coming <3
this is the next chapter to clothing shopping!
This looks like a fun experience, would like to go there some day🤩
I think it is a bit strange that you cannot see and compare sizes🤔btw great video!
Amaaazooon 😆
Hello Hope, love your videos
I love your videos!! Thanks!
heyyyyyy HOOOOOPE!! hope you're doing well! lol. LOVE YOU SO MUCH, KEEP POSTING xox
thank you I did not know this existed
Wow
wow crazyyyy!
Omg I love your videos they are sooo honest and entertaining I absolutely love them 🥹😍
Such an interesting experience! I'm so curious to try!
Those dressing rooms look AMAZING! I may just do a quick trip down to Burbank just to experience it 😃
🥳
Love ur vids this store seems so cool I wanna check it out!
This is a cool concept!
Omg
I would love to win the $100 amazon gift card for summer.  I love watching your videos.
I wish more stores would introduce change rooms like Amazon Style, and I love the "singular sample item to view" concept too. Although, I'm curious to know how true to size the clothing is, and how inclusive the sizing range is.
I wonder how it would work for plus size
This is like a dream for me 😂
I think the concept of the store is a great idea. Give it some time to fix its shortcomings and I believe it would a hit.
I am subed and I liked and turned in notifications on
Very cool!
you,er nice person you give out good reviews
Omg i would die!! The store is so futuristic! Also I Love your commitment to flying over there to make this video for us♥️♥️♥️
GIMMEEE 100$ AMAZON GCCCCC
love you hopeeee
This is so cool!!
Love this concept this was such a interesting video but I think this idea still needs some work to be really amazing. Great video Hope🤍
This is so interesting, thanks for documenting your experience!!! 👍
I love your videos🤍
You always make my day 4 times better the ever thank you for being here :)
i love your reviews they are always so authentic and always fun and interractive
The price point of everything you showed us is so incredible.  I Hope to see more locations like this.  I love the Clueless reference 💋
Finally here before 30 mins😂🫢
This store looks so funnnn! Love all your videos!
this looks so cool i want to go now lmao
Love your pink and yellow outfit that your wearing in the voice over<3!!!
Love love love your vids. They get everything through cardio st the gym.
I wanna go!! I wish all stores were like this haha
That seems like a really easy way to shop
It’s so cool that Amazon actually opened its first store!  It looks a little flawed but there’s always room for improvement right? I still think that online shopping is better though.
This is so awesome... and dangerous on the wallet!
Loved the idea
This is a very cool concept. I hope they continue to grow this idea and fix the flaws. Thanks for taking us with you on the experience!!
I didn't know they would ever have a real store ! Looks nice but still unsure what to think about that 🤗
I love the idea of this store!! I hope they start building more!
This store is pretty cool experience & thank you Hope for showing us!
Lol love the Phil of the future comparison! That magic closet is impressive
hello, i love your videos!!!
Love your videos ❤️ The best
Hope! I check almost every single day to see if you posted something new! And I absolutely love everything that you do and post! I am obsessed with your content and you just give of such a great vibe! Keep doing what your doing and being you. That’s all you need! 😉❤️👏
A need to try!
I just discovered how awesome the clothing section in Amazon is! Give me that card please 🥺
Hi I really want that gift card
So cool!

Ohhh this looks like so much fun!
HEYYYYYY
Wow Amazon store 💖 I love your videos

This is the coolest thing i have ever seen
love you love amazon!
LOVED THE VID! Can’t wait to check it out!!!
I love your videos, keep up the good work! 😍
I love the idea of this store! Ofcourse there are some issues, but it's cool to see that shopping would look like in few years.
I definitely think that it it took over the Forever 21
When I saw this video my friend was sleeping and I said “say WHATTTTTT”
This looks amazing! LOVE the dressing room experience.
This looks so fun😀
Me likey, I need a card. Please ☺️it would make my day!
This shop looks really cool and new!
Amazon scares me the have so much power! Ps. I love your videos so much!
When more shops adapt this, this could be really polished, fun experience :3
Hi i’m a huge fan…
Currently my Amazon cart is full of clothes I wish I could try on before buying 😂
Hiiiii! <333
It looks so cool and fun
Very interesting concept! Sucks about the jeans!
Amazing videos as always!! Keep up the great work and great personality!
That's crazyyyy  and also it's affordable 😭
What a fun store! I would like to try it
You're so cute
❤️❤️
Another awesome video Hope!
I love ur videos
This is the future! 🤯
Love your videos!! ❤️❤️
This is awesome! Booking my trip now. Can’t wait to go.
What a great idea. Love Amazon. Waiting for packages now.  Lol.
I wonder how long it'll be before they expand
This is such a cool concept! And I love that you don't have to carry all the items to the fitting room.
Heyyy Hope! I didn't even know that Amazon had this! We love watching you and your videos!!
I would really love to go to this store it would be so cool!
i am not late for the competition woop woop also love your hair
Love this video !!!
I love shopping Amazon done
Liked!!!!!
i was waiting for an upload from youuu! Made my day :)
Exciting way to shop ngl but maybe I won’t have the patience 😅
This seems so cool! Love ur videos!!
Such a cool concept! I wonder if it will stick and they will add more! I’d love one in Nashville lol
Hi done
Please choose me for the price, i never won anything 😅
I want a gift card please☺️
Love this idea!!
I’m defiantly going to visit the Amazon store! I’m intrigued
Pick me!! Such a cool video
This seems so cool,  yet overwhelming! Kind of like browsing online lol
I want to go there so bad lol
Love u hope
Always look forward to watching your videos. Wishing everyone a happy weekend!
Love all the clothes you that you got!❤
This sounds fun!!
absolutely love your videos!
This looks fun!! Thank you for doing this!!!
Love your vids
Need to go to the store asap! How cool!
Comment
I kind of want to go see this in LA. Might make a trip!!
Hi Hope! Love your videos!!! ☺️☺️
love this!
The experience looks amazing and fun outing to do
I love your hair it sos pretty
witch one u will choose? online shopping, semi/online like in this video, or full IRL shopping experience?
I love that pink dress but it would cost around $130 to get it shipped to India, that is like 10000 Indian rupees for a dress. Sad😐
I’m finally early I’ve never been so early heheh
Combining technology and shopping is real life in a super smart way!!
Ohhh you extra booked a flight 😍 such a good video! I wouldn’t feel comfortable shopping like this tho! I love you hair!!!🎈🍬
Ahh I wanna go! Love your videos, Hope!
This store meets my organizational dreams! Thanks for sharing.
I love the colour of your hair 💕😊
The concept of this store though.. insane.
Is anyone else slightly concerned with the info Amazon is getting on us?
That’s such a cool store.
This is definitely just a capitalistic tool to overcomplicate shopping by using "high-tech" vibes to feel more mainstream than regular shopping...     Also with me not being from the US I will never get used to people describing leggings for 25$ as affordable. The price I buy my favorite leggings for, converts to around 8$.
This is super cool! I hope more stores do something like this because over crowded racks stress me out lol
Absolutely love this idea!! I hope they take this idea worldwide so we can all experience this 😍 One downside was the fact you could only select 10 items and the fact some items weren’t available to try on! Also the second part of the video where you try them on at home! The first outfit with the blue jeans and lime green shirt is to die for🔥
HIIIIII
Totally obsessed with this!
This looks so fun!
Such a fun video! Love your content! 💯
holi <3
The little kid "AHHHHHHHHH" lol
Ahhh I want to go here so bad lol 😩
I really appreciate your honest review! I feel your pain when trying on jeans! We have the same body type!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣
i do it 😊
I made it within 30 mins! & would LOVE to go here 🤗🤗
This looks fun
This seems like such a cool experience!! I love the idea of scanning the qr codes and them bringing the clothes to your dressing room
love this
Omg I love this video!! With my shopping addiction tho, I would have maxed out the shopping cart in the first five minutes of being in the store 🥴😂
This is so futuristic!!
hopwscopeee ive been binge watching you since this past week n now im obsessed <3
wow! looks incredible
So silly that try on wasn't available for everything 🙄 but the option to just send stuff to a dressing room is awesome
Hi I loved this vid Im an Amazon adict!
This looks like an insane experience! Shows how technology can be helpful but also more time consuming than the alternative (like just going up to a rack and being able to see if your size it there or not)
Hi hope!! I was wondering if you could more videos about influencer brands or  buying my emails for a day?? Ps. I love you and watching your videos!!!
Seeing this video makes me realize how much Amazon is taking over everything in the world 🌎
Love this kind of content and your channel, Amazon is really taking over!
This is really interesting. Thanks for sharing! 👍
Hey!!!!!
I really wish I could go to this store!!! 🙏🏻
This is so cool thanks for going!
I really love looking at your channel I've been watching you for a while now it's great
This mixed reality life is slowly taking over... 🤩
This store looks amazing. I hope they make one in New York soon! Loved this video Hope❤️❤️
The future will be crazy! Amazon is ahead of the game! Love your channel!!
this would never work in the uk we have no patience lol!
Really cool. I really like your video 🥰
That's amazing. Amazon store
heellow uwu
very awesome video
here
This is so cool I’m living for this concept but I don’t like the fact that you automatically connected you to your account
I always enjoy your videos, your fun and energetic.  😍😍
Hello hope skope i love your videos
I love these videos! they are so fun!
Daaayummmm , someone please take me here
Pick me! Pick me! Lol
I’d love to come to this store it looks like so much fun!!!
I really like to watch you shopping 🤩
That's so cool!!!! Love you
This look sooo cool!!!
This was such a great video idea!
l need this shop but i dont think ill be able to get a plane there 🥲😔
Kinda of cool, but I like having my stuff delivered, but then I can return whenever. Okay the awesome closet inside the changing room is really cool 😎 Hope your videos are so much fun fun funI wonder one thing, can you return the Amazon dress you accidentally purchased that you tried on before trying Hmmm 🤔?
This would be cool but what if you find something that isn't available to try on???
This is an interesting idea from Amazon, although the small faults that you noticed should be corrected if they want people to keep visiting the store. Thank you for showing it to us!❤️
Omg I am in time!! Love watching your videos (:
Me with my Baga chips watching ur videos😌
Seems like a cool store to visit.
This shop is kinda a vibe, ly❤️
This seems like such a cool shopping experience!
I love u hope ur vids  awesome u r the best!
I love this idea! So many times I order items on Amazon that look cute but come in the mail and aren’t great quality. I would love to be able to walk around and actually see the quality and try on before purchasing!
Here in the first 20 minutes!!
I will definitely have to check it out the next time I visit California.
I just love your videos! You always make me smile and laugh. You're awesome to hang with!!
Omg they need to open more stores!!!
This is absolutely amazing! Book me a flight
shocked that im pretty early
Love shopping at Amazon
This is such a complicated system! Id rather just use the app and wait for it to delivered to try it on.
This is so freaking cool
Much love from Florida🦋🥳🦋🫧🫧🫧
I would soooo love to go that store. Looks fun.
love your videos hope! :)
that actually looks kinda cool, it's weird to see a physical Amazon! ♥️♥️
Imagine shopping alone and your cellphone dies....always bring someone with you lol
Love your videos
Cool how you just scan your clothing and they’ll have it ready for you in the dressing room!
heyyyyyyyyyyy hopeeeeeee......loveeeeee youuuuuuu.
Amazon who?.... Just Love Amazon
What an awesome video, I hadn’t even heard about this! I wonder if other stores will start doing this.
This is a very interesting experience! Seems like there are still some kinks to work out, but still very cool!
This looks both overwhelming and very fun lol
The store looks cool, love your videos 😍
This is so cool!
Wow~
OOO
This is so weird, idk if I would go personally but I do want to see more stores with these style dressing rooms🤣
This is so cool!! Also I’m loving the pink hair
Kinda wish this was on the east coast
This all seems so cool, I just find it so funny that it's coming full circle that online stores are moving back into brick and mortar locations.
oml i wish something like this is opened in India
i love shopping at amazon it's honestly the only shopping I do now because it's affordable. but an amazon physical store sounds so awesome
Love your videos ❤️
Love this wish was in Australia
Done! Love how hope gives us honest reviews about everything and doesn’t leave anything out
Love it!! shame about the flaws in the tags though
they should have more shops like this !!
OMG !! I want to go to that store....!!!!!!   Love it. How much is a plane ticket to LA from Florida?? LOL
Such a cool concept love it!
This looks so cool!!
I really loved the leggings and the video! Gotta check it out when I finally go to California.
I need to try this out now. Love your outfit you are wearing in the video. Where is that from?
Okay the store is actually so cool 😍 I want to visit 😭
Looks like this is fun
This looks like so much fun
shop looks so boujiee yet seems full of flaws, ive been to the amazon supermarket in London and that is super fun and pretty faltless in my experience!
i have no idea why, but this gives me ikea vibes?? i can’t explain it
Woahhhhh! This is so freaking amazing. Technology truly brings us to another world.
Yes please! I would love to go to this store though!
allen gang
The concept seems nice and fun but on the long run i cant see it being annoying. I like to see the actual piece in my size to see if it will fit rather then sending it to a dressing room just to find that it doesn’t fit later on.
I wonder if people would actually use all that futuristic stores in the long run…
You always have the best content! 🥰 love watching your channel!
omg i love the idea of the store but definitely could have some updates. i love you.
I would love to be able to go to a store like that, but unfortunately they will never have something like that in Michigan.
Hope you are amazing ❤️ Thank you for all your content!
Your hair! & this seems like such a cool concept
This is crazy
This is very cool but also low key creepy 😂😂
Yessss 💗
This is sooo cool and very interesting 😂 thanks for showing us how it works!
I love how real you are about the experience !!
I love you videos 😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I would love to be able to travel to some of these amazing stores.  I’m lucky to live vicariously through you though!!!!!
This is so random! I didn’t even know they did this!!
Those jeans are amazing!!!!!!!! ⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️🤍⭐️
Hey girl this looked so cool 😊 I  wonder if they’re going to be opening up any more stores and other locations 🤔
Comment 😂, idk what to say. Tyler should do videos for men
loved this video!! 💗 now i really want to fly to california to give this store a try!! haha can’t wait for the next video 💗
I don’t know I how I feel about a in person store for Amazon. I love how different your videos have been. I was here during the leggings days with cohost Leo!!
Hey hope i would love to get a shoutout or better win!
These videos always make my day!!!
I had NO CLUE that this store had opened....going to have to visit this summer for sure!
Combining online shopping and physical stores is such a cool idea!!!! That dressing room is perfect for an introvert like me lol..
omg hope i love ur vids sm and this is such a cool idea!!
The idea of this store is so cooool
I just found u last week but I have been binge watching all of your videos! I love the concept of an Amazon store, but the issue with the jeans not being in store or available to try on? Ummm, not so much!
Wow!
Wondering if they are gonna open more of these
This is interesting 🤔
Hi hope!
I would like to feel the experience shopping in amazon...
AYO I love seeing me some Hope on Saturdays! always brightens my mood :)
The concept of this store is cool but it needs some work... Hopefully it will get better. Thank you for taking the time to go there and do a video for us.
Hi, wow what a cool futuristic store, I hope one comes to my city, you got some really cute things
Amazon really came up with a great idea.  Nothing is better than actually trying on a garment for fit.
This is so awesome! I want to go there so bad! One day!
This looks amazing! One day I’m gonna have to plan a vacation JUST to go there lol
THIS seems fuuuuuuuun and also more practical
This looks great! I would DEFINITELY love to check it out!! 😊❤️
I wish Connecticut had this store!
I love your videos 💙🧡💚
hope is very committed to her fans
I would love to go there...
It seems like a really cool concept but definitely some bugs! Lol
This seems cool.. the concept of the store.
Hope !!! Great video as always
Can u do Amazon personal shopper shops for me?
Love your videos !!
Hi hope!
I don’t think I’d like the store!!!
Love your videos!!
This looks like a good idea but needs better execution.
I find Amazon hard to shop with clothes because there is sooooo much. This seemed helpful in store…though having display items without them available to try is freaking ridiculous (I assume it’s not a simple “we’re out of stock”).
Omg hope you do it again I love you're videos and you give us the best content have the best day ✨✨😊😊😊😁😁😁⭐⭐⭐🌼🌼🌼🌼🐶
Hi hopescope, i love your video! I watch them during phyical therapy.  Your videos help distract me from the painful parts so thank you!  The store is so cool! To  bad it doesn't look very disability accessible :( still cool video though.   P.S. I think it is really cool  of you that you just give away $100! quite a bit of money for us mere mortals lol!:)
Hello love your videos
I bet this was a sweet experience!!! I always love your videos!!
Woah this is so cool
Here!! Love you Hope ❤️❤️❤️
This would be a cool idea!!
Very cool concept. The future is here lol 🥰
i haven’t watched the video yet but i wanted to take a moment to tell you how much i appreciate your positive energy and genuine excitement in all your videos. i found your youtube channel only a while ago but i‘m so happy i did because you make my day with every new upload. thanks for being girl!💗💗
I'm so glad you did this! It looked so fun! I'm glad you showed everything from your experience
So cool.  Thanks for the review.  So interested to see how amazon does brick & mortar
I love Amazon and your videos. Great combination!
I spend so much on Amazon, plzzzzzz
hiiiii

This is what I want to be able to do. I see an attraction that I would love to visit, book a flight, & enjoy the experience 🥂
Hello, this is my first time making the 30-minute cut for one of your videos. It seems like a good idea just executed poorly.
Love all the 👗
ahhh loving this video. And the store seems to be futuristic and im lowkey scared.
Im already subscribed a long time ago , duhhh, cuz I love you're video's so much and you're hilarious and an amazing person ❤
Loveee this
This is a super cute idea
idk how I feel about this
This is actually really cool! Its weird to think that Amazon is taking over the world slowly though...
Hey! I’m kinda early! Love your vids!! That store looks really cool!
Cool
i can't wait to see if they open more around the country.
This is such a fun idea! Love your videos
I want to go explore their shop now! 😂
I was wondering what this kind of store was going to go. It’s a cool idea but hate that they have so many flaws. I guess this is just a trial run for them? So glad your doing these kind of videos!! ❤️❤️❤️
So much fun! Love that I don’t have to carry things around
Phil of the future & the clueless references tho 😝😝😝
Love you 😍
This is soo cool 🤩🤩🤩
Done.... Love your videos.. ❣️❤️😘 love from India
This seems like such a cool idea!!! Maaaaan, so sad i live SO far away! :') (Denmark) Love your videos Hope!! <3
I hope I love your videos and I watch them ever day
Thanks for sharing! Didn't even know they were coming up with a store. Seems cool but trully taking over the world
I also live in Utah and love seeing someone from my hometown make videos that I love to watch. ❤️ This store looks so cool. I love how it only one piece out for each item makes looking around so much easier. Thanks for posting a new video every week ❤️
It is exciting 👍🏻
I had no idea this even existed!! Seems so futuristic! Not sure I love the idea hahaha
I could watch you do absolutely anything!
love this!!
<3
Oh wow, i hope they open some shops in Europe!
Done
This is such a good idea, wish all shops did this and the dressing rooms are so fancy
Looks like a good idea especially for active wear since many are picky about the feel of the fabric
Whoa this looks so freaking cool!!!!
While I was waiting for new video, I looked trough bunch videos from even 2 years ago. This Amazon shop looks too futuristic to be real.
I was waiting sooo bad for a new video of youu 💛💛💛 thanksss 🫶🏻
Obsessed with this vid! How exciting the shopping of the future
Loved it!
Interesting experience!
Hi
Ooo this looks great
:)
This is such a cool concept! I'm sure it be a while before there are more locations though
This looks cool and like a fun experience
This actually seems so cool, (if they fix some flaws) it could be one of the biggest places people will shop for clothes...
This is so cool!really wonne shop there :))I love your vids!!❤️
omgggg i love your videos hope , i also wanna visit this store but i live in india  anywayssssssss the amount of efforts you put into your videos is phenomenal hopeeeee   i lovw you queenn
Love this! Hope one comes to the UK...
This is such a cool idea!
So coooolll😔❤️
Am i getting a giftcard?
heyyyy love that vid
I think i like their corner store idea better. Like where you just grab what you want and walk out and it charges your account
this looks so cool and i love the honest reviews you’re constantly giving!!
I was thinking about amazon store the other day and thinking they should open one 😅
❤ i love your hair
Hi I would love the Amazon giftcard
Ion like their nah reply😒
Good idea to have a store Amazon. But looks like there will still be an issue with finding clothing in stock and to try on like most popular stores. Shopping anxiety sufferer here 🙋🏼‍♀️
The store looks nice, but I would have been frustrated with the jeans too...
This is so weird!!
This store looks pretty cool!
Desperately need some retail therapy ❤️🥰
This is so cool, I like that Amazon is keeping up with technology
Love u guiss
Done
Pretty interesting 🤔
This is so cool honestly but definitely disappointing how they had stuff in the store that you couldn’t actually try on or buy.
its like online shopping but in real-life, kinda fun tho! and a lOovee cheap fashion😍😂
So nyc to see this ❤️
Hi!! I love your channel so much and I look forward when I see your new videos posted! You are one of my favorite youtubers! Me and my mom watch your videos together at dinner all the time. You have taught me so much about fashion and you are one of my idols. I love the way you make me feel like I am there with you while you shop! Thank you so much for bringing me up in my darkest times!! I LOVE YOU! ❤️❤️
What a cool store! Not sure I am ready for sure a high tech place 😂😂😂😅😅😅 traditional shopping for me
i don't know what genre of videos you'd call this but i love it. tech shopping? unique shopping?
You looks so gorgeous 😊
That looks so fun!
What a crazy experience! It will be insane to see the day when other stores start picking up this technology, and it becomes the norm. I hope you had so much fun!
Seems fun but a little bit creepy! Reminds me of something from Black Mirror
i love ti
Hiiiiii
This is such a cool concept. & I love how you’re keeping your finger on the pulse of everything new. I never knew about this store. & those jeans…. Love them.
Heyyy girl:)
This is such a cool store. You are such a amazing person. I love how you are always telling your real opinion and not just going along with what everyone wants to hear.
I don't understand anything!!!
i believe i am within the first 30 minutes :O
This is AWESOME! Thanks for always being on the look out 👀
I love this idea but it seems really flawed
hey hope i would be super greatful for a gift card!!!!
Helloooooooooooo
Hi
Ah omg I wanna try Amazon Activewear so bad! Ahh
Wow this is so different,I had no ideia of this XD
Dang. They gotta bring this to Canada¡
I love your videos !!!
oo, what an interesting concept.
Seems like a cool experience! Interesting to say the least
Love your videos 💥
Im in the first 30 minuteeesss. I have to pay for my own locker accessories and I would like amazon. But I dont have the money….. pleaseeeeeeeeeee
Omg I was sooo excited when you said the store was here in LA! I will definitely be visiting this place!
This looks amazing
Hi HopeScope I’ve been watching your videos for years it’s so cool to see how far you’ve come! Also this is random but I just saw you donated $1,000 to feeding America that’s amazing :)
Hey loved the video. Looks like a Cool place.
Amazon's gonna take all of my money
I love this concept! Although, I feel bad for the workers running around and prepping every room
Love your Videos but I think the Store is a No for me 🥰
Looks amazing!!! Do they have plus sized.....i wonder
New shopping experience. I love the dressing room
Hi I love your videos
I love your videos! This is probably the weirdest store I have ever seen.
Hiiii
I don’t know how I feel about this…. It’s kinda cool but also weird.
This is good, we dont have this here in India. :’)
Amazon is really moving up in the world
That’s such a cool concept! But needs time work 😄
Technology these days
Hiiiii I love your videos sooooooooooo much and you keep on making my day amazing [ps. I am subscribed] :D
This is a very interesting concept! I think I would feel very overwhelmed with this!
Totally want to go there!
Love you girl but, Amazon. EW!!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
What a unique experience!! It’s a bummer that so many jeans weren’t available!!
fun!
Jealous what a way to shop.
love you hope! your content is amazing
That looks like so much fun. I definitely want to go there and try it out myself.
Welp! It’s not great shopping experience if item is not in store  But do wish to experience the fitting rooms
I can not believe Amazon has a store now!!!! Btw ilysm hope! Say hi to Leo for me pls!!!
Hello
Hi!
What an awesome concept! You can sift through on your phone rather than in store!
Wow, I love the magic dressing room.  Hope these stores expand across the US.
I love this! Need to try next time I head to cali. Just will steer clear of the jeans lol
this was so cool!!
Wow, interesting
!
Thanks so much for making the best vids ever I always get so existed when you post videos your amazing 💗
Cool concept
Thank you for always showing the good  and bad for the these kinds of videos. The codes falling off is definitely not great  I’ve loved seeing how your channel has evolved over the past few years
I was scared I wasn't in first 30 mins and I was ....yay 16 mins .
This is so cool. I love your videos 😍
Aww i wish I lived in California, this just sounds soo much funn!!😭 I wanna do it soo badd! It'll prolly take like 5 more years to get something like this to happen in India 🙃
I love watching these videos.
I love You
It’s cool but I would like normal shopping this is to much work
8 love you're videos so much. And from Germany. 😍💕
honestly i would so love to be able to shop like this😂
This is so fun and different!
This is so cool 🥰
Let me in!
i love to watch your videos with my family on the tv
Love your content!! 😃
Your hair, outfit and makeup 😍😍😍😍
I always love watching you shopping ahahah
Would give it a try, but for sure they have some kinks to work out 🙂
Love the video I watch all ur vids and your my favorite hope!!!!!!
The premium feel at an affordable price. Come over to the east coast, Amazon!
Not having to carry all your items around the store is definitely the best part of this store.
man this whole thing looks so cool😭I wish we had something like this in India 🥲
Omg heyyyy
This is such a cool experience!  :)
This looks so amazing and I hope to go here soon. Amazon is taking over and I’m kinda here for it!
Waitttt, I need to go here.
Wild! I always wondered how the Amazon store would work.
Why do I love watching you shop , this video was so fun and cool but Amazon what’s going on
this makes finding sizing soooo much easier - now i really wanna go :0
Hiiii
The whole Amazon becoming a store is a low-key scary concept.. it's like it's spreading butttt it's a cool looking experience
As an introvert I love the idea of being able to do everything on my own!!
This looks so fun!!
Such a cool concept!!!
This is a cool way to shop. Not sure how I feel about it lol but love your video! 🦋👍
I hope they open more stores 😍😍
ahhhhh finally made it finger crossed .. love your videos!
hi hope
Omg I love your videos!!!😍💗
looks very stressful and fun at the same time
Hi loves your videos
;-;
Hope you're the best
The concept of the changing room is amazing! 😍😍
This looks soo cool though!
I need this store!!!
great😍
This shop looks soooo cool, and can we appreciate how she booked a whole flight just for us
Brick and mortar ... "Online is killing brick and mortar "  Online retailers... "hold my purse"
Getting all items to dressing room is so cool 👍🏻❤️
heyyyy ! i love watching your videos they are on of a kind
Me Amazon gift card I’m eary
This looks like so much fun to try out!!!! Another great video! ❤️
Oh my goodness! Why does this give me Clueless closet vibes 😍 I want to go!
My god!!! That looks amazing!! I can't wait for them to come to the UK x
the magic cupboard gives narnia vibes
This store still gives me a bit of anxiety 😅😅😅
I kind of love the idea of this. The suggestions/closet thing in the dressing room is something else.
Looks cool!
Looks so fun!
This looks like such an amazing experience! I would love to try this!!
Amazing! Need to go 🙌
I shop on Amazon so often it would be cool to be able to try more things on.
I really like Amazon but they rarely have anything for me 😭
That was surreal. The less human contact, the better. I hope that's the future of shopping! 💕
I love this concept!
<33333333
Thats so cool! 👏👏
This store looks really cool!!!
The store looks pretty cool very futuristic  I love the walkthrough you gave I love your videos 💕☺️
This place looks so cool!!
So interesting!
I am obsessed with your vids. I would also love an Amazon gift card:)
this is cool 😊
I was waiting for your new videos, as I already watched the old ones😂 This store looks 😎
This store looks so cool, I wish I lived near it!
brilliant vid... :) things r changing.... (boom boom)
Good concept, but some room for improvement. Thanks for taking us along!
Interesting concept, I don't know if I'd shop there or not if it was closer of course. Btw your hair is amazing.
Wow seems so much like something from the jetsons crazy how much might change in the near future
This looks awesome I definitely will be going there soon!!
This is such a good idea for a video always makes my day better when I get to watch one of your videos! 🥰
I love watching your videos, they are so informative about diffirent products especially active wear. 😍
Pretty cool video I’m a huge fan ❤️ your videos
Hiii love your vids
OMG! I finally made it in the time limit!! I would love to visit this store
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Being able to basically go the entire time without talking to anyone is peaking my interest 😂
ohh i love your style  and your shopping speers ❤from INDIA
Amazon is taking over the world!
The future of shopping!!! I hope they work out the flaws this would be neat to see in more areas
Ooo my first thought was I don't have to carry stuff around 😳😊 both a blessing and a curse, since I have a limit on how much I can carry (and buy) 👍🏻✌🏻😊🤘🏻
I would love to see the behind the scenes of this store :)
Okay, shopping experience is very cool, but can we talk about the editing and graphics you’ve done in the video!? It’s amazing!!
Thank you for doing all the work checking things out so we don’t have to. We appreciate you Hope!!!♥️
Amazon is trying to take over the world lolol! Love your videos! 🤍
This is so cool
I want this shopping experience yesss
Loving how fast it fell apart at the jeans rack.
i actually really like this i wonder what the plus size options are like!!
I love hope, she is so kind and does so many give aways. She also donates so much money and clothes too.
So, why do they have stuff there that isn't even available, seems a bit silly to do that.
can we get amazon stores everywhere lol like thats so cool!!! also... LOVE YOU HOPE YOUR CHANNEL IS THE BEST!!
Love this! I think it’s cool to have the option to have a tangible Amazon experience rather than just all the guesswork 😂 not gonna lie though I love the option of never going to a store also
This store looks so cool! I really want to go there the environment looked really cool! Thanks for introducing us to this store! 💙
That looks so fun. Will probably to there next time I’m in LA.
Wooaaahhh this is amazing hoping to win the Amazon card 🙌
lol the fact that I got an Amazon ad before watching this video 😂
This looks cool. Love your videos 😀❤️
Loving a hopescope moment!
i really wanna try this out!
LOVE IT... I CAN'T AFFORD HALF THAT STUFF EVEN FROM AMAZON.. LOL
HEY HOPE U MAKE MY WORST DAYS INTO MY BEST YOU ARE MY SMILE ;D
I like the concept of the store.
i wanna go so bad :) anyways have a good day hope :D
I feel like they should take something off the floor if it's not there or can't be tried on like a regular store. Kind of a tease to show you something you might love and then be like "oopsie nope"
hey how are u this video was so fun hahaha
Great in theory!! Only room for improvement for sure.
Love to discover new technology!
Love the idea of not walking around with clothes.. but on the fence as a whole
It so cool I want to try
I feel like it’s hard to decide what size you would choose without seeing every size of an item sometimes
Kinda want to go there
Love it!
It’s such a cool concept but it didn’t seem like they haven’t fully figure it out yet XOXO I love your videos so much they make my day a lot better 😃😀
Amazon needs to open up more of these stores!..Seems like a great way to shop!!
Hmmmm…. Super interesting but they need more time to figure out those barcode scanners… I could see that being a huge issue if a scammer were to change the barcode to something malicious 🤔
This is so cool! I had no idea Amazon had a store like this.
girl this is amazing ❤️! I would die here 😅. take all my money! and you looked fabulous!! 😍 love all of your videos!! ❤️😍🤩
One of the reasons I wanna visit us
Just found your channel and I love it! Your personality shines! 🌞
Helooo I'm here early!! Such a cool store 😁😍
Is it just me of is it crazy how far Amazon is going like now store hahha
Love ur vids!
I feel like if they start carrying more/different aesthetics, this could actually end up really popular
Hi
I like your hair.
i need money 😔
The amount of dedication you have to bring us content is just remarkable. Love ya hope ❤
Your videos are so fun 🤩❤️
I would love to go to the Amazon store!
Hey hope! I love ur videos! Would love a gift card <3
Absolutely love this! New here and so glad I found your channel 😁
The dressing rooms are so cool! So wild!
this is kinda cool…. 👀
Hello I love this vudeo
Hi 😊
Hiiiiiii
Great video..loved the outfits
Wow! This looks so cool!
Love the video!
I wanna do this now so bad
Love youu 😍
If they had it all over the states, I could see so many people going to this store. Having them bring it to your dressing up, instead of holding everything. Your hands are empty instead of having your hands full! I love watching your videos!
That dressing room is the dressing room of my dreams
Wow I never heard of this store before. Hope you had an amazing time! Also stay amazing!❤
Hiiiii I’m doing the 30min drillll pleaseeee pick me I love you
I need to go to one of these🫢
hiii i love ur videos
❤❤❤❤
Dedication by booking a whole flight to go see the store😮 love how interactive everything is!❤
I’m gonna go to California pretty soon so I’m going to go
I love that you just scan the item and it shows up in the dressing room. So Cool!
i literally love watching you shop and it has started a real addiction for me!!
I’ve been watching your videos since the legging queen days and I love the new, different videos you’ve been doing!
💚
this is so cool
Best dressing room ever!
This is such an interesting concept. Very futuristic. Wish I could experience this in person. Thanks Hope for showing us this. Never knew this was a thing.
You have been killing it hope! this is such a good video idea!!! So fun to watch, love u hope❤ ❤ ❤
This looks so cool! I’d love to go there and try it out. Also, love your videos!💕💕
One of the most relatable youtubers out der ! Rock on gal🤟
I would love to go visit that place! That looks so fun and like such a unique experience!
Hello
This is awesome. Thank you for sharing with us 😃
I adore this idea now if they could implement this throughout the country to where we could all enjoy…
That actually looks quite awesome. Wonder how long it will take someone to switch the tags on the outfits around if they come off so easily thought...
This looks so cool!
Cool but also seems like a hassle
This looks so good!!!
Love you so much such a good video
I liked the idea.
Weird that they won't have them for try on and you have to work on their schedule.
New to this channel and am obsessed! 😍
I'm pleasantly surprised by this store! It seems like it takes away the discomfort of the fitting room for both the customer AND the employee, more brands should do this!
Also, thank you for shouting out Phil of the Future 😅 that show is hard to find and felt like a fever dream!
Love your videos!! I can’t believe how early I am!
This seems like a very interesting/fun experience!
Thank you for sharing. This is a great concept. I love that you don't have to carry a bunch of stuff and how clean the store looks with just a single item showing for each item.
this is absolutely wild! I would love to visit
I liked already sub and this is the comment
this is so cool!!
hi this lokks coll i want to come btw your amazing :)
Love this idea. I usually hate shopping lol
I like the pink dress lol  Dressing rooms look amazing!
That looks so cool!
love your videos ,can't wait to see your next and hoping to mabey get the gift card.
Finally!! I'm within the first 30 minutes! :D Love your videos Hope, they brighten my day! :)
I’m afraid to buy clothes off of Amazon 😬
I would love to stop there it's so cool. When are they go to open 1 in the UK???? Because it's so cool also love the video keep up the good work.❤❤❤❤
This looks so cool but also weird.
First thirty minutes, I’m here, subscribed, liked. You’re great
That store is so cool we are living in the future
The store is an awesome idea. It's cool you did a video to cover it.
THE WAY I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS !!! u have a choke hold on my life AHAAHA
But it looks so cool
This is a cool but odd new way to shop! Love watching thank you for the wonderful content ❤️
The place is so cool! I want to go there sometime.
OMGGGGGGG finally I'm a "little" early hahaha, your videos are suuuuper addictive :'))))
Here within 30 min🥳
Loved the video, didn’t know Amazon had an in person store though. Kinda cool idea.
So cool! love it all!
Crazy how much Amazon is taking over. Thanks so much for taking us to see all this. Such an interesting concept!
Top marks Hope
That looks EPIC
YESSS IM ABLE TO JOIN HAHA
The introvert in me loves this.

Your videos are amazing and you are so much fun to watch and I am exited to watch your videos they are the best
Love it, thanks Hope, what a super cool experience!!! I want to go there too.
So cool hope they will expand it to Europe
Combining online and in person shopping is interesting...not sure how to feel about it!
loving your hair!!
Hellloooo! Gj!
This shop looks so cool I am so excited to some day go there. I love shopping on Amazon
This is so cool, too bad it’s across the country 😂
Absolutely love your videos❤️
Hopes living in 2099
This looks soo cool tbh and in some type of way I do want to go there.
Damn this store is sooooo cooool. I wanna gooo!!!!!!
Kind of a neat idea! Wouldn't mind checking it out, but can absolutely see how this could get a little annoying! Love your videos!
This is such an interesting store. Shopping for clothes while in the dressing room is amazing!
Cool video!
Wow. this looks so cool and fun! how did people think of this idea!
Woah, I neeeeeeed to shop here
Wish there was one in the UK!!! Xx
Wait this is so cool i’m obsessed! love you hope!! Also love the new fan name “Hopefuls” that’s the cutest thing i’ve ever heard!
Woo my fav gal with fun hair, doing us all shoppaholics a service . Muah 😘😘😘 from UK
As an Amazon warehouse worker I can tell you this is similar to how a warehouse works lol. This store is absolutely amazing in my opinion. With the small flaws and all.
Ive never been this early! Im going to have to try going out there and see what I find
😍
Love the video
I would LOVE this!
Hopefully the lack of try on inventory is just because it's still a new concept cause this would be so convenient instead of returning everything... or forgetting to...or just being to lazy too for too long
Looks like a cool idea and less stressful
So cool….the store looks awesome and loved the video❤️
It is just me or does this process seem way more stressful than actual shopping. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Hope, you’re amazing!!!
Hope I really appreciate how you try out all trends, new and millennium. You're so inspiring for those of us working on our dreams!(:
Thanks for making me smile with your vidéos 😁 love from France 🇨🇵
I‘m saying hi from Germany. Just wanted to say I love your videos ❤️ you a auch funny and real, I love satiating your videos where you give us a real honest opinion :)   PS: love your return videos 😜
it looks cool though??
Thank you for this opportunity. I'm FREAKING out 😂
This looks so cool!!  But kinda scared about how much amazon is taking over but still want to go there hahhaa
I love your videos and this store is so cool
What a good idea. I want to go check this out!!
I love this idea!
This is awesome! Are there any other locations opening?
This is so interesting
Omg this looks so cool and I love your videos so much ❤️
Looks so awesome!!!! I want to go 😂 also LOVE your hair, makes me want to dye mine again!
Such a cool idea. It looks fun
Fun concept but I can see lots of issues arise
Top marks Hop
Heyyyyyyyyy:)))
I like the concept of the shop
This is such a cool idea!!!
How fun!!! Definitely adding this to my itinerary next time I’m in town! And I’d be on the search for jeans too! It’s so hard to find a good pair that fits me just right! And I need a magic closet everywhere!!!!
I love this video! Hope is always so creative!
Oh my god...Did I just manage to leave a comment within the time limit?? 😏
So cool magic closet thingy is amazing
Love the Amazon store. Thanks for the video!
This is sooo cool.  Keep doing what you are doing hope. :)
pick e for r that card bb
This is a really cool idea.
Think I still prefer shopping online but I guess it's nice to not have to carry around a bunch of stuff before trying on. Def need to do something about the qr clips popping off.
Omg...love living vicariously through you!
Interesting!
You are so beautiful 💜
The dressing rooms look amazing. What if your phone runs out of battery haha
Seems like they are trying to solve something that wasn't a problem? Like, I don't mind normal shopping and just getting my size?
The dressing room seems pretty cool. That they bring you stuff and that you don't have to go look for it.
Ooo love this concept idea! We love you and thank you for the amazing content!
Interesting 🤔
Interesting concept - im not sure if its really simpler to have someone else basically carry your items to the dressing room for you, which seems to be the only benefit. Plus you lose out on one of the pros of in-store shopping by not getting to see your size on the hangar first, while also losing out on a lot of the pros of online convenience. I do really like the barcode cataloguing though.
Amazon is my favorite online store!! Great video!
I had no idea they had a store. So cool and love this video!
I was just there yesterday! I'm not sure how I feel about shopping this way though.
This shop looks soooo cool, and can we appreciate how she booked a whole flight just for us 🥹
I love Hope's dedication for these videos!😍
love your videos so much and your hair.
How exciting to see something like this. Thanks Hope for sharing 💐
I was like "When this kinda thing will be available in my country".... probably 5 to 10 years after this
Great video!
HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nice vid !!!!! :) liked,subscribed!
love the video!!! addicted to your channel lol. not sure how i feel about how much of a takeover amazon has here and also the flaws you mentioned are a bit concerning, seems pretty over reliant on tech, and it kinda sucks that it’s only accessible if you have a smartphone. those dressing rooms are super cool though!!!
what if you don’t have a functional phone??? or your battery dies???
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH
I’m very intrigued by this. Seems like they need to work out some kinks still.
I love your videos so I’ve been watching for so long and I follow you on Insta!
This looks really cool
So cool. You are such a amazing YouTuber! I got your phone number and I am super happy that I did because I get to watch all your videos on time! I love you Leo Loving Legging Lady!💕💕💕💕💕
i always have mixed feelings with shopping online because i love trying on things… this is amazing!
so cool 💙😍😍 love from brazil
omg this is so cool what
I love Amazon and your videos! 😍
I FINALLY SAW YOU POSTET A VIDEO IN THE SPAN OF THE 30 MINUTE DRILL. WOHOO 😂
Omg!! I heard of Amazon fresh but never Amazon style. I love going shopping with you.
Hey I do wanna win shopping card... I stay in India and follow uh for the Kardashians weird closet 🤪 ILY
So excited!
Omg I have to go 🥺
Yeah I made it lol  We have nothing like this in Australia 🇦🇺 it would be great
this is soo cool
This is one of the coolest shops. Great idea for introverts !
Cool store...love this!
Heeeei,love you smmmm!!
Oh I am HOPEFUL!!!
How cool!
I have had my eye on something on Amazon for quite a while. It would be amazing if I could be able to get it. I would be sooo grateful. Love your videos!
Sooo exciting!! Love from India.♥️♥️
Here within 4 minssssss
love you vids ! i will literally sit in bed at night and binge watch them haha :))
This is such a cool experience!! Thanks for sharing 🙏
Can I please have an amazon gift card love you loads btw
What a clever idea.
Does anyone else love her hair?
Everything looks great on you and what a cool experience!!!!
I like not carrying anything! The dressing rooms are so nice
Hi I love ur videos
Hope ur awesome❤️
Can i please have a gift card bc my cousin's and brother's birthday is coming up and I want to get them something special
woah!
I love your intro fit
Such a cool experience, kinda futuristic 😅
Wow the delivery of a new size to your dressing room is so high tech! This is definitely futuristic! I’d have a hard time only trying on 10 items at a time but this is beyond cool!!
this is so coooooolllll
Interested to see how this does while all other in person stores are having a hard time, super neat video!
❤🥳
This was such a cool experience!!
Wait this concept is so crazy!! I need to book a flight then!
Love your videos! Thx for letting us know about the new Amazon store!
This looks awesome, but also kind of overwhelming in some ways. Would be an interesting experience for sure. And the screen in the dressing room, just as you said, total Cher vibes! I loved Clueless growing up, lol
Thanks for reviewing this! I’ve always been curious about these high tech Amazon stores - they’re not in my city yet
damn... amazon killing it
I'm subscribed, liked and this is my comment! This looks so fun
Very interesting concept… I think I’d be stressed 😂
you have the best vibe Hope :)
Another great video! Thank you
this is so cool! it was really funny when the barcode tags kept falling off the jeans 👖💀 i love you videos and i literally can’t wait every week for when you post ❤️
This is a very cool idea! I use Amazon way too much to be honest. Lol
This is absolutely an introvert's dream omg
I think this store is really cool! I hope they fix their kinks!
Love u and your videoes!!! This is so cool
loved the blue dress
The idea is awesome 😍🤩 But Amazon stores need more progress it has flaws clearly  But the whole thing is just amazing 🤩😍😍
I would be so happy to have one close
The convenience!! Now if only they open one on the east coast!
OMG so cool I love Amazon!
This is Kinda Amazing
Sooo cool, I love your videos, they keep me company and cheer me up 🥰 thank you
So excited for this video !
Fingers crossed 🤞 🙏 😀 ☺
Can we all appreciate how much work Hope puts into the videos! She flew to California just to make this video for us and that’s awesome! Hope if you see this thank you for how much work you put into these videos and all the giveaways you do because it is so awesome! I also just love your channel because it never gets boring and you always have awesome videos for us!
OMG!! I need the leggings. They look so nice and they have pockets
oooo looks fun! seems like they have a few flaws in the system but i kind of expected it! love your videos!
I love your videos. Please send me the $100 Amazon gift card. Thank you 😁
Woo I’m on time!!! Love your videos, energy, and realness. Thanks for showing us this new store and futuristic way of shopping!
Oh my, not having to carry clothes around the store is the best part of this! I hate the hanger lines I get on my hand and arm.
I’m still mad at Amazon for sending me the wrong curtains…😅
I personally think pink would have been better than purple
So fun! Love it
I wish this store was here 🥺🥺
I love the Shop and i like how it is set up
I love you Hope!!! 💕💕💕💛
We should all give a prayer of thankfulness for Hope trying out all of this stuff for us
Awhh this is so awesome! Id be nervous that like nothing would be in my size but this would be such a fun day 🤩
I love you.  Not late this time. 😂
I saw that you I donated to feed American that is awesome you are so nice
This looks so cool! I have been waiting for a new upload! I love your videos!
Cute choices!!! The first dress and those jeans 👖!
It seems so cool, could not even imagine something like this exsiting...
Hellooooooo!!!!
Desperately in need for some new jeans lol and I have definitely never tried Amazon jeans so it was $100 gift card to test them out would be great 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to go and shop there!
Amazon gift card comment? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love u hope!!!!!!
ohhh I was waiting for a videoooo
Soooo coolllllll
Love your videos so much! It stinks that they didn’t have the jeans you wanted, they were so cute!!!
Interesting concept for sure, I hope they come more places
This is soooo cool
hey hope 30 min check i love ur vids 🫶
I want to go here!
I'm here early!!!
Loveeee
This store looks really cool . I wish for Texas to have one!
So cool!! No more grabbing 3 of each item in different sizes to try on 😂
Wayfair tried something like this in Boston a few years ago but obviously Amazon’s concept looks much more functional. Definitely intrigued by this, the variety looks great
This store is so cool! I wish there was one here in Australia
Love this video what a cool idea
Oh wow! This is insane! Love you Hope
I’m finally early this looks like such a cool experience
I love your vids and watch them all the time! I love how honest you are about all of it too, and your so unique and kind hearted! ❤
The coolest, high tech store I have ever seen!
this is what i need in my life!
What if your phone dies in the middle of it?
this looks awesome!! i love how it’s not cluttered 🤣
This is such a cool concept! I wonder if they'll bring it into San Francisco next.  Thank you for your always insightful, thorough review!
This looks like so much fun!
I'm soooo excited to try this, but a little scared. Seem to have a hit or miss experience with ordering clothes.....but always HOPEFUL ☺️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️ U Hope.
This is such a cool concept. Kinda want to try out one of these dressing rooms omg.
This store is a cool idea.
This is wild and looks like so much fun. I hope I can try it!
Hello I would love to win a gift card! Tysm!
oh my gosh it's the first time I make it
Yes under 30 minutes 😁😁
Wait no this is SO cool!!
It’s crazy to see how far technology has come. Cool how you just scan your clothing and they’ll have it ready for you in the dressing room. Would love to be able to go to an Amazon store !!
The concept of this store is so cool 😍😍😍
Ooooo it might have been so fun😫👀❤️ I love your videos
YES YES IM EARLYYYY
I love that you do this for us! I agree though... pretty disappointing that you go in to see the styles in person and try them on and more than half aren't even in the store or available for try on which like you mentioned... is the whole point of going to the store vs shopping online lol but I really love the idea that you just scan what you want and go! This whole experience was just wild to watch though, the fact that they have your clothes in your dressing room ready + things you'd like all while your shopping without you even talking to an associate lol then being able to switch sizes while staying in the change room - holy convenient! :)
This is so cool. I can’t. Thx for trying out this store for all of us.
Love this  it looks so cool!!
They need bring one to east coast!
your videos are so fun to watch
hi hope !! sending lots of love to you, leo, and tyler !! i’ve been subscribed since the first legging wall and it’s been so fun to watch you and your content grow 💗
love from India ❤️♥️ hope i loved your content 🥺
I hope they open more of the store across the country!
Love your videos this looks cool I want to go there
Looks cool @ a great shopping experience. TU
The magic closet!? Very cool!!
I didn't even know it was possible to be impressed with a dressing room experience 😱
How do you always come up with such great concepts? I love it!
I love your videos their very informative and entertaining.
Would love to go!
AHHHHH AHHHH AHHH IM COMMENTING  BELOW BELOW BELOW 😆 I love you, I love your hair ❤️ and I love this video.
That looks like a really cool store.
Interesting concept, but looks fun! Love that they send it to a room for you.
🥰❤️
Leaving the sofa to shop, nahh
Looks so fun!!
hi hope 😀
i wanna go sooo bad ahh
I love you so much
This is so cool!
It is an interesting shopping experience.  Would be nice if they had more of a selection.
I’m going to California next week , I’m have to check the store out 🤔
This looks awesome!
obsessed with your hair!! but I could see more stores trying to do this in the future
I legit am so happy I found your videos! Always brighten my week! :)
I really like how they organize the dressing room, I NEED that magic closet
Love your videos so much…that’s all ❤️
Great concept, I hope they expand it into other cities
I didn't know these existed?? Is this just an American thing? Also love the outfit,your cardigan is SO CUTE! <3
This actually seems so cool, if they fix some flaws it can be one of the biggest places people will shop for clothes.
I love your videos
I was here at 7:30 but didn't see the video until 11 minutes 😢 edit: wait I'm here early enough after all! Yay!! I would love to go to this store!
I want to visit this store!  Thanks for showing us how it works 👍🏻
I like the concept and its kind of... futuristic in some way, but it feels weird at the same time :D
This looks so cool and very nice for people to at like online shopping and shopping irl
🍬🍀🍀🍀
This is such a cool way to use technology in real life shopping!
Love your videos
Hope: I like this dress it’s the same dress I am wearing Me: I do that all the time and then relize
This is incredible!! But ngl I’d be pretty upset & annoyed about not being able to try on most of the jeans too 😂 that has been my hardest find in ANY online shopping experience😩
this looks cool!
I love that you did this
Love your videos. I always get so happy when  I see you upload❤️❤️
It looks so cool!
This is such a cool concept!!! I wonder if more stores will integrate this concept in the future 🤔
Love your videos they are the best
I hope they make one of these in Austin
This store is so cool! Reminds me of IKEA!
Ps: I do have an instagram account
This is so cool
Best video ever
Hi I lost my wallet the other day and it had hundred dollars for an Amazon gift card so I really hope I can have it
great video!
Omg love the new video!! We totally need one of these is Colorado!!! Love your vids Hope!
You look gorgeous
Love your videos, they’re always so unique and interesting! Always excited to watch. ☺️
<3 im so envy right now :) wish i could visit the store :)
Those dressing rooms are so cool!!
luv u
hiii :)
How cool! I would definitely try out if they ever opened one in my city.
I’ve never heard anyone reference Phil of the future before 😱😱😱😱
Amazon is just wild and it gets weirder and weirder
Love your videos to wake up to 🤩🥲
This looked really neat, I also hate trying on jeans!!! My butt and thighs always argue with my hips about the style and fit!!
Hi Hope.....I really hope 😉 you bought that first blue/lavender romper you tried on in the video.  It was super cute and looked GREAT on you!!
This seems like such a good idea definitely on my bucket list
This is cool! Would love to experience this.
Such creative content by Hope. Always up for new shopping ways, flying to LA!!! You go girl✨
Also, can you please link that last blue dress that you show in the dressing room before you checked out
I hate fitting rooms too!  This would be an amazing experience.  Can’t wait until they open one closer to me.
There's always flaws with high tech stuff. Looks like a fun way to shop
Love your video. Leo is so cute 😍
Love you Hope
So cool! I had no idea Amazon was going to do this!
This is so cool!! I would definitely be buying some maternity clothes with the Amazon gift card, I’m 12 weeks today and none of my workout leggings fit 😒 love your videos!!
Just started following you in the last week and I’ve binge watched so many of your videos! ♥️♥️ Lots of love from Pennsylvania!
Not my just wanting to experience Hannah Montanas closet as a changing room that sounds epic I love to hate shopping so this could actually be a good experience for me
I have a very intense relationship with Amazon. I'm a small business owner....therefore I receive up to 20 Amazon packages per week. The only downside to this experience is how much you're required to be on your phone. I understand that its all linked to you Amazon account. It's all very cool...... especially the actual try on. The way that you have items delivered while you're in the dressing rooms. VERY cool.
I loooooove amazon !!! this was so cool to watch, im going to california for work soon and hopefully i can check it out!!! thank you Hope !!
This looks so cool! But let’s see how long something like this sticks around
The overall idea seems cool, but it's disappointing that some items weren't even in stock/available to try ): you'd think they'd be more prepared. Great video as always tho Hope!
What a fun way to shop! Hope you enjoyed your time in Cali Hope! 💗💗💗
This is is cool!
🤞🏽 🤞🏽💫
This is super cool wow
Great video yes before it was a forever 21 I have recently loved Amazon’ clothes I’ll have to check out the store thank you for letting us know about it :)
This store looks like a dream!!!!
Under 30 mins!
your videos are always entertaining
😍😍😍
I've never even heard of this store!
Hey Hope any gift cards for me, here in Canada?🥰🥰🥰
Only having one of each item makes the store look really clean and organized.
Hello, i have been obsessively watching your videos for the past 2 days. Hope you get pass KimK soon.
Hey
Wishing all stores were like this. Would make things so much easier
What a crazy store
This is so cool!! It’s like shopping Cher’s closet in Clueless! I’m here for it. Also “the Drop” styles from Amazon have been 🔥🔥🔥
These dressing rooms are so cool
Such an interesting store, something truly new
This is wild! Once they smooth out the tweaks this would be so awesome!!
This is so fun I love shopping on Amazon!
This idea is kinda cool tho 🤙
OMG THIS IS KINDA COOL
Took a PLANE to shop!! Spend to spend
This is so cool!!!
This is such a cool shop omg!! I love how dedicated you are and your wonderful YouTube videos!!🥰❤️
hi hope
I was unsure but the dressing room is a different level
Ooo!!! I would love to try this
This seems so much easier to find your style
I love the dresses!
Omg!! Any chance you accept a follower to go to this type of stores with you? It would be so much fun 🤩
do they have scrubs in the store tho??? seems like a cool idea, interested to see how they expand
I would love to visit this store! 😍
❤️
hope really goes all out for her videos and  i appreciate her for that
Omg your Amazon secret outlet vid was AMAZING but I shouldn’t be surprised bc all of your vids are AMAZING!
First time early . I adore your energy and videos🫶🏻💕
Thanks for sharing this! So cool!
Done
That store is wild. I am not sure if it will catch on everywhere.
This whole futuristic shopping concept just blows my mind 🤯 bc we have nothing like this anywhere near where I live
Definitely want to go there!!!
This is so cool, I had no clue a store like this excited!
I love your videos Hope
I think I’d be so overwhelmed here but I love this video ❤️❤️
Wow, never knew there are stores like this. Cute outfits though!!
That looks like it would be so much fun. Especially not have to carry things while you still shop.
Interesting. I wonder if they'll ever open them in other cities.
That dressing room!!! Seriously, I could hate everything the store has to sell and would still keep going just to use the dressing room. :D
STOP THIS VIDEO ATE!The editing AMAZING and omhhhg I have to go to this store!!!!
I wish I could travel to see places like that! Guess I just have to settle for Amazon Prime! Love seeing all the cool things you do ♥️
Wow, it looks futuristic! Hope I could visit this someday. 😍
YOU ARE AMAZING
I wish this was in India tooo
I would love to win! I love your channel!
Love your videos hope, I look forward to them every week :)
I feel like online shopping 'in person' could be really helpful for not impulse buying! Everything looks awesome on the screen but normal in person so you don't get that same dopamine hit of thinking everything is going to be amazing. But the items automatically delivered to your dressing room is pretty fantastic! Haha
I love Amazon, this would be dangerous LOL
Hii i love ur videos so much can I have a gift card
Just like any other brand, their first drop is never really good. Hopefully they will know how to make it better
Oh my gosh this is the future of shopping!! I can’t even! Thank you for always thinking of us Hope!!
I want to go so badly! I’m obsessed!!
I wanna visit this store😍
Honestly I get overwhelmed trying to shop for clothes on Amazon so I can't imagine it would be much better in store 😅
I know I can always count on you to try out all the newest and sometimes weirdest things out there haha 😄 Maybe they need to work out some of the kinks since they just opened?? It seems like a neat idea though! P.s.- I remember when Y2K was a scary IDEA that computers would crash and the world would end lmao now its a trend 😂
It's just sad that so many things weren't available 🤔🤔
That's a  really cool way of shopping!
Those jeans are so nice!
It’s kind of weird that you can only pick 10 items but then they are going to put even more in there that you didn’t pick for yourself
I love how you are always down to book a plane ticket to anywhere only to shoot this videos. 10/10 dedication
Hi love your videos you always find a way to entertain us
I really wish everyone had this opportunity to shop. I want a stylish closer without spending too much money!
Love this video , thanks hope
This is awesome would love to see it in person...this vid was nice and made me want to give amazon more money 💰💸
Welcome back hope! The Amazon store seems like a good idea in theory, but I don't think I'd like to shop there. I'm good with my department stores.
Love the dressing rooms. So much less pressure!
I’ll have to go visit this store
Time to see what it is all about
Those dressing rooms are so cool!! I love that you don’t have to talk to anyone!!! Everyone should have dressing rooms like these!!! It is so cool!!!
Do we have the same name? I am an Allen from birth. Are we family?
This looks so fun!
What a fun idea! Hopefully if they franchise this the bugs will get fixed!
I really wish everyone had this opportunity to shop. I want a stylish closer without spending too much money!
Omg at the Americana? How did I not know about this lol I want to go today but also I feel like it’s going to get super packed super quick and they’re going to be out of stuff
Early!! Here before 30 min! Loved the vid, new way of technology so cool
Love
Hi love your videos
please go to the nordstrom secret store!!!! I need to see the deals you can get there
This looks awesome! I live in LA and have heard people talk about it but I love that you're showing us the experience so we actually know what to expect. I'm definitely going to check it out now :)
This looks so cool Hope!
What an interesting experience! Thanks for making this video.
I'm early and would love to get an amazon gift card this is not actually andy callis this is his daughter.
That dressing room is amazing!!!!!!!!
So cool 😎  love this
I LOVE UOIR BUDEOSSSSSS
omg i love amazon
I’ve been going through a rough time and you posting made my day! LOVE YOU ❤️
loved this video!
This is so futuristic, but california is way too far :(
I love amazon i use it for clothes my baby and me
The feeling about being stressed in the changing room? Felt that to my soul.
Wow this is crazy, totally the future but definitely some flaws lol
Absolutely loved this! What were the leggings you pulled out in the beginning and said were the best cheap leggings you can get? Thanks for sharing, Hope!!🥰
I live in Australia am I eligible to enter the contest?
Love your videos hope❤💯
I love this idea! I wish there was one in Canada😢
I agree with you on the shopping experience.
Woot! I wish I could go!
I don’t know if this would be overwhelming for me or if I would love it but this is incredible
Such a cool experience!
Hey! I love your videos and I am so excited and ready for your big new video project. Keep doing what your doing and making people smile with your fun entertainment!
I want to go there!
I WANT TO GO THERE
looks fun🤩🤩
hi
Hi hope! 😁
I’m putting this store on my bucket list lol
The store looks so futuristic! Cool🤗
HIIII!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! when ever you post a video it makes me so happy!💕
Yay!!! The concept of this store seems so cool! Thank you for showing us!! Love your videos Hope 💖💞💖
Hey Hi I luv ur videos
Yeah I made it 5mins in!!! Lol  good luck to all 🍀🤞🍀🤞🍀🤞🍀🤞🍀🤞🍻🍾🥂💕
They definitely need one of these in the UK for me to try! 💖
I love you vidoes so much
I need a gift card!!
Would be fun to go to one
I want an Amazon gift card! I love you Hope!!
Woahh posted 12 minutes this is probably the earliest I’ve been
I wish Australia had a store like this 🇦🇺💜
Okay the way you don’t have to talk to people at this Amazon is made for introverts lol is there only one!?
This is new to me.
I wish they'd open one here!
Ohh I'm obsessed with a of this honestly a really cool idea and I guess I'm not surprised that there are bugs since it's new but even with those it's still neat. I'm also obsessed with those dressing rooms it would be nice to not have to carrying the things you want to try on around and then ask a worker for a dressing room then the ability to have new sizes delivered. Honestly I think the amount of like non human interactions is doing it for me cause like that's perfect for someone who has social anxiety or something and struggles to ask for new sizes or for a dressing room and such. But anyways loved the video <3
Such an amazing store idea should have that in more locations
A very interesting video. Thanks for sharing.
The store looks really cool
I love you videos so much❤️
Very cool and futuristic looking, able to try things on before buying is definitely a plus for me
That is actually kinda cool…..  taste from the future guys👌🏼
Done everything!
That's lame that they didn't have the item's available
*books flight to California…
This is insane, I love the concept !
Super cool, futuristic storefront! Hoping these become commonplace throughout the US!!
Need this in my life
Cab I gat the card I have never shoped in Amazon

That's so cool! I'm curious about plus sizes though...
That is quite an interesting store! So excited to watch another video of yours!
Omg this is amazing!
Unsure how I feel about this concept if they had more items available to try on maybe it would be better but it’s strange all around 👀
I'm not an Amazon fan, but the concept here impressed me. Great video and experience.
I want, no, NEED to go there
This is so convenient!! Definitely adding this place to my bucket list 🤩 Btw love all the pieces you bought Hope!

First time I get here within the 15 minutes
love this idea for a video hope!
It’s cool that they have you unlock your dressing room with your phone 😂
I know this shop will never be near me but I’m in love with the idea of it. Knowing me my phone would be dead if I ever got the chance to go 😂💖 adore all your new videos and the new ideas your coming up with
Interesting concept ….. it’s giving Las Vegas hotel shops!
This video was so entertaining!!! I get so excited about your videos that I sit and wait for them up to an hour before they're uploaded. You feel like a friend!!!
Wow cool *-*
Love the fact you don't have to carry anything but def a work in progress. Thanks for all your fun videos!
I'm here for great finds☺☺☺
Is very weird an Amazon Shop...
This is a bit wild 😜, but it seems fun as well. It would be interesting if they actually have a plus size section in this store.
This is super cool!
Omg I want to go! Lol love your channel  keep doing what your doing💗
Omg seeing a physical Amazon store is so weird! But the dressing room situation is a whole vibe! How does it seem both retro and futuristic 🤔🤣 Keep the amazing content coming 🦋 💘
🛍🛍
Could really use that gift card for my new apartment!
...
I religiously watch your vids lol, they're so therapeutic

I loved the video fingers crossed I win a gift card!!!
❤️‍🔥
First time subscriber here! Your videos are amazing Hope!
I think this system definitely has some perks to it. But it could also create a lot of problems. What if people want to shop but don’t have a phone? Those dresses were so cute though! Thanks for the upload Hope 🥰
Omg love The jeans!!
Meh...they need to rethink some of this
It's different for sure but they should have more try on items
Tyler is wrong. the pink was definitely better with your hair ❤️

Hi I love your videos keep up the good work
I love your videos☺️ The Amazon store is so cool.
Hey hiii 😘 amazing videos
This is amazing!
❤️❤️
This is like try before you buy on steroids which I think everything should be try before you buy. My fav! So wish I could go to cali and check this out.  I will live vicariously through you!🤣♥️
Hi hope!!
EARLY U POSTED THIS 10 MIN AGO SCORE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BEING EARLY OMGGGGGGG
That dressing room is everything! I don't like to go to them, but these Amazon dressing rooms, I'm a believer!
I don’t know why but I like carrying all my stuff around 😂😂 if I can’t carry anymore I should probably stop shopping. Maybe that’s just me. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Amazing
The future is here! a cool in-between of online and in person!
I love this
Woah. Is this the future of shopping?!
hii!! I love your videos. This store seems  so fun !
I would love to go to that store it looks so cool <3
Love everything you do!!
How cool to get a little of online shopping with in person shopping!
♥️. Love your channel, this is the earliest I've ever been to a video. I got here with them 7 minutes of posting.
Weird but really cool!!! Love the cool dressing room 🙂♥️
Sub,like and commented 🤍🤍
This actually makes me want to shop instead of dreading it
I love this groovy look with the pinks you are wearing today!
8:11 CUTEST DRESS!! Does it come in white?
The magic closet tho 😮😮 technology is insane!!
ok but they need to do this in europe too! we are always left out
That store looks pretty awesome, especially the different sizes they bring into the closet! Would love to win a gift card! :)
earlyy:) this shop looks unreal they need so many more of these omg
Thanks for sharing your experience, can't wait for it to come to France!!
Hiiiii...yeah I really have no idea what to comment since I’m early
Love watching your videos and all your info on active wear .
Not gonna lie, they should have like 5 to 10 of each of the items in store so stuff like this, yknow, wouldnt be a hassle as much
I would have love to go there but I live in France 😭😭
This is super cool
Your video ideas are so unique!
This seems so fun!!! Would love to do this with my girlfriends💕
Definitely looks like an interesting experience- I'm sure that I'd also be the person that all the tags fall off for when I touch an item 😂
Oooh I still want to try this, flaws and all.
Ok those dressing rooms are so cool!
hiee, I've been following your channel for more than a year and a half and I've always seen you be this kind and just..giving. It really makes me so so happy. Thank you for inspiring me to be a better version of myself. I live in India so you probably won't be able to give me the 'gift card' but I honestly don't even want it. I'll just be very happy with you seeing this comment. love, Ishnoor
Heyyyy. Love watching ur vids
I love that this is happening!!! Changing the world of shopping
Literally had no idea that Amazon was opening a store that is freaking awesome.
Ohh this is so cool
I love all your videos! I'm always looking forward to them. Thanks for being so honest and awesome!!
I love the concept of this! Thanks for testing it out for us!
I would totally shop at a place like this! I get overwhelmed with having to sift through sizes.
Love that Hope takes us with her on adventures. And her pink hair is so pretty.  The tags dropping was startling 🤭
So I follow her 3 years and I only wait when will new video come out because she gives me strength to do everyday things, her light energy and confident is the biggest thing to push me through the life 😇
Give me. btw loves your vids.
I love your videos
Love you Hope.  Happy I'm part of the text squad :) Fingers crossed to win
❤❤❤❤
I am kinda freaked about the add to your dressing room -beat but idk still hehe
Loved this! Is sooo cool
I am here!!!! lol this kinda creeps me out tbh xd whats next a chip on my wrist? 🤣

This looks like SUCH a fun shopping experience!

Seem like a fun experience. Love your videos!
I love this video ahah
Looks cool!!! I like Amazon way too much…
This looks so cool!
How do I get those leggings
I’m here!!!!
The privacy omg and them bringing another size when it doesnt fit wont help my wallet 😂
okay this looks so fun, crazy to see how technology is evolving
Are they opening anywhere else?  Live in Florida.
I love it, greetings from Poland ❤️
This just seems like shopping but hard. Lol
I have never been too trustful of buying cloths on amazon however this seems like a cool unique way of getting round that worry.
Op
Hi Hope!I love your videos, keep up the amazing content!!!!
Yoooooooo
Hey hope been following a while your one of my fav YouTubers id love the gift card to get diapers and wipes for my son love you can’t wait for next video 💜
GIMME A GIFT CARD PLEASEEEEEEE I REALLY LIKE YOUR VIDEOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSS HOPEEEEEEEE
This is amazing I love it 😍
Wow, this looks rad!
Love your videos, hope❤️
I like the purple with your hair! Love your vids hope! Keep making them!
Hi I was able to see this 4 minutes after it was posted!!! Never done that before. (I’m always 6 hours late lol)
Love your channel!!!!
I would Love to try the store out I'm a plus size so it's REALLY REALLY hard to find jeans/ clothes that fit well and look good and are age appropriate!  I already have tried the Amazon stylist where they send me clothes they picked and all but one didn't fit (too big, even with measurements) so I've been looking to the new try before you buy but it takes a few days to get them then I've had to return every pair of jeans shorts Ive tried to get in the past two weeks 😭🤣 I have a big butt, so I feel your pain when looking for jeans 👖 also thank you for all the videos you do, you have helped me get more comfortable with online shopping ❤️ Thank you Hope
Fun idea!
hiiiii dude i love your vids sm. i literally binge your old vids when im bored :)
The store looks cool with many pros but kinda a bit of cons. It’s  a win loose situation.
Store different but at least no more returns to the postal office
This actually looks real cool and interesting , I swear Amazon is going to open a store for everything soon 😅 love your vids Hope ❤️❤️❤️
I love how clean the store is, the clutter of every size can be overwhelming. Wish it was closer to me!
This is such a bizarre concept 😂😂
Love your videos they are so interesting you never disappoint!! 🤪🤪
So convenient you don’t have to carry all the clothes around. Sometimes my arm hurts after a full day of shopping 😂 🛍.
This looks like so much fun! I love shopping online, and in person, so this new amazon store is incredible!
Yes AMAZON QUEEEN!!
hi hope!!!!
Hiiiii Hope
Beach dress and black leggings 😍😍 Those dressing rooms are crazy 😱😱 So nice
I love your videos 💗

this must make a really cool shopping experience! loved being able to kind of experience it with hope through a screen lol

Hi
Have fun on your beach vacation!!!
Watching from the Philippines 🇵🇭
Look at Jeff finding more and more ways to drain my bank account 😅
I love your videos
Really love your hair
Those dressing rooms are everything!
So futuristic❤️
This is such a cool video! I like the idea of having a single size in store because you don’t need to worry about if you’ll have your size on the rack (although if it’s not in storage then idk lol)
This is really cool! It is very futuristic just like the amazon grocery store!
This is so cool
Always look forward to your videos!!!
when I go to California I really want to visit this!!! Thank you hope for showing us what all of this is like!!!!
You make anything look flawless!!! I just love your channel!!
Good morning! ☕
love your videos!
This is pretty cool but scary at the same time. The best of both.
That’s such a cool experience. Also you look amazing in everything like always!!!
This shopping experience looks pretty amazing
Like ur my favourite YouTuber I stopped watching every one of YouTubers because ur the best I love ur video it's super entertaining I love you hopefully I get to meet you
This is crazy... Amazon has grown super big.
amazon in foreign is soo much better
Oh my gosh!! I'm early for once! lowkey love this idea though, seems very economical
I would literally die if I got a Amazon gift card lol
our queen is back!!!!
giveaways
It doesn’t seem like a lot of fun 😅
I’d love to go there!!
This would be a dream!! 😍😍😍
Hi Hope!! This is interesting
If only more stores followed this model
Amazon is definitely the vision of the future!
Please never stop making those videos!
I would give this a try!
This is such a cool idea. Love that you can scan the item to be sent to the dressing room!
Omg I love your videos so much and they should have these everywhere
That's such a cool store!!
There is a grocery store that Amazon made which doesn’t have a Cashier you scan and then you pick whatever you want and there is a lot of cameras that scan what you get and what you re put to the shelves
Hi crazy experience to watch!
Love from India 🤌❤️
I loved this video!!
Very interesting experience!
Woot woot
What an interesting experience!
awsome store !
Hi! So cool! Choose me! 🥰
This store is such a good idea although it needs some more improvement

Wish they would put one in Tennessee! This is exciting!
That is for sure the best dressing room ever.
I was waiting for you to post! ♥️♥️
I’m obsessed wit these Amazon videos lol also can’t get over this pink hair 😍😍💕

I can't believe Amazon said "nah" to you! Lol how rude! We love you! 💗
Oh my gosh the change rooms. Totally jealous we don't have the store here

I literally got SO EXCITED to see the hopescope notification come up on my phone! *putting good vibes out there in the universe that I will be picked as a winner*
Just appreciating your work hope🙌 Not me hoping for Amazon coupon 😶
I think it would be incredibly intimidating to have so many options. But, I’m game to give it a try.
That looks so fun :)
this seems so cool!!!

I love your channel and that new Amazon store is amazing!
This looks pretty cool! Love you and your videos!
This is awesome. I’m wondering if other stores will start to do this. Amazon is taking over!!!
Looks so fun
Imagine if your phone dies...
Liked and subscribed!  Btw ur videos are best
I hate going to dressing rooms too! Love that purple
Not sure how I feel about this idea, glad you tried it out for me.
The gift card could be really useful for me, so I can buy my family a few presents. Thank you, and I absolutely love you videos.
The code things falling off the hanger would give me anxiety 😬I'm not clumsy people, it's a flawed system!!!
You are my favorite YouTuber I always love watching your videos and you all ways help me know the what the good things to buy on Amazon
I love amazon but nothing beats that instant gratification of getting it right then.....
So much exited for this, let's gooooo!!!!!!!!
Yeahhh a new Hopescope video!!
I loooooove her she is soooo good at getting videos ideas❤️❤️❤️
Your hair looks so pretty
Hi l love you so much and l love you video so much......bye hope
Amazon gift card??
Love your videos 🤍
This looks SO fun!
looks so good! wish they had one in the UK!
I love that purple dress! This looks like such a cool experience. Love watching all of your content💛
This looks pretty convenient. Kinda scary how Amazon is going a little too fast. I wonder how the future would be
I’m not sure if I like this idea but I’m glad you went and checked for us, as always. 💗
Wow!!!! I Loved this Store!!!! And Love your Channel!!! Watch everything you post especially when it comes to Shopping!!! 😀
Lmao the dance while waiting for the item size change
This seems like a good idea, but idk how i would feel about there only being one of everything 😅 also never been this early to a Hope video!!
Yay!!!!! A new video!!!!!! I love all your content!!!! You are adorable and I love watching anything you put out !!!! 💛💜⭐️💛💜⭐️💛💜⭐️💛💜🤍
Hello i honestly love ur videos hope also like the variety is...hm chef's kiss  Let's see if i get a gift card lol
4 min lol and there is already 410 comments.
YEY! So excited for this one!!
The jeans tags tho 🤣
I'd get way to carried away in there haha
I’m finally early enough to be in the first 30 minutes 😂   Love your videos hope! I’m so happy for you , you’ve come so far. 😁
Oh my goshhhh that’s crazy!!!! I didn’t even know they had a store
This is the future!!! So cool 😎 😍
This is such a cool idea! Amazon Canada’s fashion selection is iffy so this would be neat
That’s so cool
I'm always so excited for your videos!!!!!!!
This looks so fun!
What an interesting concept!! Thanks for the vid!
Such a good vídeo, love all of them btw
Jealous of the store, but mostly...the people just standing like...next to hope, and they don't even know 😅
You booked a flight?! Wow talk about commitment. I love this. Thanks for the video Hope you’re amazing.
Love your videos. When I saw the notification I had to watch
Looks cool but I need to be able to try everything on. Was the “nah” email from Amazon real? Lol 😆 The green sweater is so cute!
This video is awesome you give us all the information that we need like the flaws the good things and lots of others . I am always excited to see your videos . I hope you have a great day 💕
❤️
You always do absolutely amazing ! So excited to see you !
Love your videos. Early today as iam gallon prepping for a grad party.
This looks so cool to do I wanna do this
Such a fun video and interesting concept of a store
I love your videos!
wow I love this store!!
The design of this store is so cool!
Can’t wait to watch this video hope! You never fail to entertain! 🤍
I need to add this store to my list of things to do!!
I wish we had one closer to where I live.
I was also about to go to bed and seen HOPE. Had to stay up 💞
Too bad they didn't have jeans for try on. That would have been perfect.
Seems like it’d be a nightmare to work here lol
This is quite exiting to visit, definitely gotta go next time in Cali
I love these types of videos❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I will admit. I am an Amazon addict. First step of recovery is acceptance 🙈
Wow! This is really interesting. Thanks for taking us along!
need those YOGA PANTS! <3
Pick me
That closet is magical!!🤯
Scary but impressive
Ooooooo can't wait to try from Ireland
I love all your videos Hope. Thank you so much for making my day better!
You got such cute things!
This store is so cool!
This looks... Interesting. I'd definitely love to try it out
that looks so cool. very futuristic and it looks like a fun way to shop. i hope i can go there sometime!
Great video!
...
Need to go there
I'd have a panic attack if I thought I broke something,  lol.
I love your videos you are one of my inspirations in my everyday life ❤
The dress room was my Favorite part!!! 😎
This looks like such a fun experience!
This is sooo cool!!!!!
Even if I’m working I always stop to watch your videos!
i‘m obsessed with your shopping videos, I binged all of them yesterday HAAHHA
I don't think this will ever be available i  my country but it sure is cool to watch!
Loving the dressing room situation
Yay I'm here first 4 mins!
OMG, this idea is brilliant!! I love that you just have one of each item on the racks- so much cleaner and easier, I think!! So, I had to break up a cat fight before I could finish my comment, so I also wanted to say that the dressing rooms look much more comfortable than your standard dressing room- I know that most are set up to prevent shoplifting, but give a girl a bit of privacy!! The pink bodycon looks great on you! ❤
I love every video you post 💕🥰
LOVE YOU HOPE! ID LOVE TO GET PICKED!!! <3
Omg! I would love to go to this store
I heard that Amazon had a grocery store but this concept is super cool!
Hi Hope! I love your videos and everything you do for us.
This is awesome!! So cool, wish I could go there
Love your videooosss 💕x
Get well soon naka lots of love to yu
We love how the way amazon fashion people just said nah
You are amazing ❤️
I would love to go there
I don't understand why they don't have items for try on when this is the whole point of those stores 🙈🤣 I always between sizes and I always have to oder two to try on. I hate it so much 😅
The store is a good idea but definitely some flaws 💕💕💕
I think it would be better if thy let you have more than 10 things to try out and I like how the dressing rooms are
I really like this idea to try once I think. Idk if I would go often but I want to visit. Unfortunately I live across the country😂😂😂
Looks like a good idea ready to see how it  ends
Love this idea!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Gooood Morning!! Have a great day!! :-)
Love this video😍
I sooooo wanna go to one of these!!
Really good point about not having to carry anything. That looks great to me😂
That is crazy Amazon now has a place like that
Amazon + Hope = my two favorite things. Lol <3
I love this video!!!
Hiya Hope and Hopefuls!!!!!
The first 30 mins!
So excited

The hair still stuns me 😍🤩😍
I can't wait!!
I need jeans too 👖
So excited to see this store! Thank you for showing your shopping experience!
omg this is such a cool idea for a store, seems dangerous though because i would just add everything to my dressing room hahaha
Really liked it... It's really pointless if items Displayed are not available... Anyway love the way you speak and analysis ❤❤❤❤❤
Hiiii I love your channel
I would be nervous about T-Maybe's phone's data taking forever to load 😂😂😂 I can imagine myself standing at the dressing room WAITING for it to open 😅
Always so entertaining! Your videos are literally a go to for me when I take a study break 😅
OMG LOVE THIS VIDEO!  keep doing what you do 😘
Love this and never knew about this lol. Love your videos

I would love to go to this store. Can you shop in muliply genders? I wear mens and womans clothes
Coool🤭
That's so much fun!!
I love these types of videos! This store is so interesting and I hope to maybe visit it some time! I love that you don’t have to wait for an attendant to unlock a dressing room for you!
Sooo cool didn’t even know this was a thing lol
they need to bring one to more states this looks sooo cool
hi
Ah! I would be there for such a long time looking at everything! What a fun way to go shopping! 🙃 Definitely need to check it out whenever I go to LA. Hope you are amazing and love watching all of your videos! 💛
I subscribed about a month ago & I  love your videos
That’s so cool, I wish they would open something like this in Italy :/
This is a great idea
So fun! I like the thought of being able to find things in store without the hassle of someone just trying to make commission.
You never disappoint!! Fave youtuber ever
Hope never disappoints us with her videos.
I love you hope! Your videos NEVER fail to bring a smile to my face no matter how bad of a day I’ve had. You have helped me through tough times! ❤️❤️❤️
❤️
Love the shopping experience
Commet, love your videos
Wish jeans were available
Nice video!
This looks like a sweet experience!
This is a really cool concept! Who knew shopping could turn into such an experience (especially being hands free) ! Would love to experience it myself one day 😊
Hello
That looks like such a cool idea, I would love the ability to try on things and actually see how they fit before I spend and return so much stuff…
So fun !!!
Tbh, I hope this isn't the future of shopping
I love all the feedback you give in your vids! I would love a $100 gift card
That “Nah” from Amazon was such a VIBEEEE! 😂
Love your videos Hope! Keep up the great and fun work you do!!!
hey !!!
Sweet
Can’t believe they messaged back ‘nah’ ,like do they not know who we are?!
i am in love with the concept!
Booking a trip now!!

That’s wild😮 I like the pink and purple dresses❤️
Hello

Im so excited and I just can't hide it 🤑🤗🥳😃🤩that stinks only 10 items booooooo🙄😒
Hope I don’t know if you will be able to read this but I love watching you because you are a very beautiful person and you inspire me so much! I wait everyday to watch your new videos. And when you don’t make a new video I watch your old videos because I loved every single video. I am also subscribed to your Hopescope but short. And you look good in leggings. Love from Kentucky!💕💕
Hi I love your channel Ive been subscribed for a while and liked the video I just go tth notification that you posted so I immediently clicked on it and I really love you and your channel.  I just wanted to let you know so I can be applied for the amazon gift card
Every dress looked cool on you!!!!
Thats rlly diff but kinda cool ngl haha 💀🤝
I love watching your videos! Seeing them always makes my day better!
Hi I would like the amp one gift card because my grandmas birthday passed and I was not able to buy her a gift because I did not have any money I made her a card but I kinda fell bad about it I feel like I should have got her a gift so this gift card would help me out a lot. Also this was a really cool video I wanna go to this store it looks like it has lots of great items
This technology is insane! The dressing rooms were wild
Looks fun but sketchy!!!
Early!!!
This is so cool! Wish we had something similar in Italy❤
I love the idea but it definitely seems flawed. Love it
I'm in the 30 min mark! I liked and am a subscriber! Love your videos and how generous you are!
This was such a fun experience!  I had no idea this even existed.  I have to check it out now! Thanks Hope!
i LOVE these videos. hey from new Zealand ! ! ! !
Coolest things Amazon or any othr app has ever done
It looks fun/good but I feel you need to have a plan on what you want to buy.
I feel like this would be both stressful and fun at the same time
first 30 mins lol... LOVE U HOPE!
That’s so fun!
Interesting concept. Would visit just to for the experience.
I love your video’s!!! You’re literally the only YouTuber from who I get notifications

Such a cool experience! Your videos are incredible!
This seems so cool!
This is such a cool concept! Definitely want to try this out
I want one 🤗
So awesome!!
This is pretty neat but we're clearly still far away from a streamlined experience
This is when I wish I still lived in Cali. How cool!!!
Hi! I got the text and I’m very early, and I just want to say thank you so much for putting so much work and money into your videos. And you always make sure to give back to us! I love you Hope and love being your texting buddy!  (Edit) you rocked all these outfits and I loved the dresses on you! I would love to win a gift card, but I know A LOT of other people would too. Good luck everyone!💕
I.LOVE.THIS
Please choose me for the amazon gift, I am never chosen for anything and I am watching right after you posted.  Love your videos even if I don't win ❤️
Hi hope love this video your videos are so good
Ooooooooooooooooo SLAYYYY i love this video ahhhhhhhhhhhgggggggjdh ✨🥰 Ur one of my favourite u tubers
Howdy! Looks really interesting
Hi Hope! Wow this is so cool!
This seems like a more immersive, self paced, and thoughtful shopping experience. Too bad they didn’t carry more items for try ons lol. That would have definitely been the icing on the cake 🧁I would love to check out one of these stores. Most def a more efficient way of shopping~
So… Indiana is boring!!! We never have anything fun like this… love your videos!
Your video makes me wanna go so bad!!
Love the concept but agree— def some kinks to work out. Love the video though! 💕
Done!!!!!
This is so cool!!!!
I never thought this could happen!
Here for the give away plsss
can we all just appreciate how much effort she puts into her videos!!!! they are amazing<3
Kinda crazy considering Amazon was meant to never be a real store with the "get rid of the middle man" idea.
I love that Amazon made a store 😍
This is so cool! Thanks for the great vid Hope
I’m intrigued to go to this store now lol
🧡🧡
Hi

I have been waiting for a new video! Love the time and energy you put into the video
Sounds like a fun idea
Oh wow, I feel too poor to be watching this high tech store 😅 I love your energy in your videos, makes me happy 😊
hii you're so pretty
Hi!
hi
Hi hope! I watch your videos all the time and you are so funny!
The only thing I dislike about HOPESCOPE is waiting weeks for new videos 😭😭😭
That is really cool, I like shopping Amazon but sizing is tricky sometimes lol. ❤️🇺🇸
This is an interesting concept!
I love this!
Cool!
I kind of like this concept but at the same time not really!
I always have my notifications on!! And thank u for this video, I wonder will other stores start doing this ?
i love the pink in your hair
This is awesome!
This is so cool!!
Really interesting concept. Hopefully they work out the odd little quirks.
omg her shirt is to die for!!!!!
Love this. But do I really need to go to LA? 😩
Amazing, but not available for most of us. 😢
Love your dresss! I want the exact one
Love this!
Interesting experience!
That looks so fun and easier than in "normal" store
Hopefully they come to Ireland xx
Wow! I didn’t know that there was an amazon store! I love this type of content Hope!
I didn't even know this store existed. Hope they open in Canada
Wait did they really say just "Nah." Or is that edited???? Haha 😅
Hi hope! I’m waiting for my ride to the emergency room and you coming to my phone notifications makes it better
I love the idea of this!
You're SOO COOOLLL I love watching your videos!!!!!!!!!!
Happy goodmorning Hopescope!! This video is so cool, amazing and creative alike all your other videos, I admire you and your style so much and I would love to see more shopping content! Edit : I would like to say thank you for making me feel so amazing and confident by being so optimistic and smiley!!
Omg I can’t believe they answered with “nah” or even that they denied you. But thank you for making this video! This is such an interesting concept.
Yayyyyyy! I would be frustrated flying to California to just not really enjoy the experience. Cool concept but not executed!❤️
Thank you for sharing your experience!
Yass
Thank you for doing this so I don’t have to. Love your videos.

Happy Saturday!  So ready for your new video!
Oo this store is sooo interesting, if only barcodes would stay on 😂
So fun!
This is such an interesting idea. I wonder if it'll take off.
This would be awful for me, Amazon has been too convenient for me lately 🤣
Hey hope! Love the video. Could you try a clothing haul from an indian traditional clothing store? Like suppose indian wedding gowns for cheap or something
This looks awesome.  Love your videos! 😀
I kind of love this but it also kinda scares me 😳
This is too cool!   And I am getting the Sweaty Rocks jeans!
Love
Hey, girl!
I’ve never expected something like this from Amazon
OMG it’s sooo cool. I’m seriously debating if I should drive 4 hours to go see it in person!
this looks interesting and i get almost all of my clothes from amazon
They said "nah." Hope said "challenge accepted!"
I NEED TO CHECK OUT THIS STORE!!!!!

The shop looks so cool! More online stores should do this!!
AHHHHHHH! I effin love it 😍

Love ❤️
I guess I'm 30 mins before !!! Love your videos though
I love Amazon and I love how they make stores but it’s in only on state
OMG Hope there so much I could say about you but am going to try and sum it up! You are hilarious, kind, smart and the ABSOLUTE BEST YOUTUBER!!! Your vids brighten up my day and just make my day better so thank you for being you!
Interesting…I definitely want to go and check it out 👀
Hello
This sounds so cool to me!! It’s so high tech I’m not really into that much but this looks like a fun store!! 😊
Miss leo🥹
It’s four minutes in I’m subscribed I liked I’m in !!
Love your videos
Interesting concept - too bad they don’t have everything in store though…
Love this video! Such a cool idea. I hope they will open more stores like this.
♥️♥️♥️
Can we all take a second to just appreciate all that hope does for us. She is always finding a way to keep us entertained. We love you ❤, keep it up!
Amazing video
hi your great
Ahh I love your videos and I made it in time in the first 30 mins
I absolutely love you Hope! I will definitely be shopping at Amazon Style! Love your videos!
liked! I love your videos and can't wait for more 😊 x
Amazon is literally taking over
Your videos are the best part of my Saturday! :)
This is so exciting!!! Love the video!!!
Love the concept but it seems like Amazon has some work to do. But the video is amazing!!!! Had to click as soon as I saw it
i have literally been binging all your videos they are sooo good
I’m finally early!!! Didn’t know Amazon had this. Thank you for showing us!
This is so wild 🤯
this is so cool!
This looks way interesting!
Can you pick me for the gift card
Hahaha
Love this!!!
I would love to have one of those stores in my area
Now I really want to visit Cali!!!! 😮
This must have been such a cool experience! This is the only way you can see the physical product before buying with Amazon—you really never know what you’re going to get😂
So excited for this video 🤩🤩
Who else wants to go there?
Very interesting concepts. Good to know the issues with it.
So cool !!
I wish I live in CA so I can go!!! :(
I want to go to one of these
This sound like such a good store idea!
omg that looks like so much fun! i live and california and NEED to go there :)
Kind of cool, kind of scary how connected everything is.
Love you ❤️
Excited for this!
Seems like a fantastic idea, but the QR code guys need more stability.
I want one in Australia 🇦🇺 😆
Love ur vids! Keep it up! ❤️
This is a very cool concept 👀
Omg hope your so pretty and I love you I’ve watched you forever and whoever reads this message I wish you the bestest luck in life and I’ve a wonderful day hope>3
So excited about this! It’s really cool!
Done🤗🤗
This is an amazing idea!!! Love it❤️
I had no idea this was even a thing! Crazy! So fun to see!
I always love her reviews and they are always so helpful
DONE DONE DONE! LOVE YOUUUUU I HAVE ALWAYS DONE THOSE YOU ROCK MY WORLD AND GOT ME HOOKED ON LULULEMON I LOVE YOUUUUU HAVE AN AMAZING DAY!!
This is so cool.
I like this idea since it’s easier to try things on in store rather than take them back, but clearly there are still flaws in the system. Thanks for the video!
The hair is looking divine 😍😍😍
Why are all the cool stuff in California 😩👏
I think it's hilarious how e-commerce was going to put brick and mortar stores out of business and now they made their own brick and mortar store 😂
This looks really cool! Such a fun shopping experience 😁
Just letting yall know that Hope donated a 1000 dollars to feeding America, she's soo kind. Also she's soo positive. Hope, you made me feel soo good about my body because of this attitude of yours.  The pink bodycon dress looks like Marilyn Monroe 🥺🥺😭
30 min, daaang I got this in the bag
I love your videos
As neat as that is, I don’t know about that.
Ahhhhhi love this video so much! Going to have to go here 1 day for sure!
Hellooo

Always look forward to your videos 📹 😊
I would love to go to this store someday
Hi pls pick me
So exciting . I love your videos !!!!
So cool
Low key this sounds very useful for a disabled person. They bring it to your dressing room. No need to zoom in and find the right size.
woah!!! They tell you if the dressing room is available!?
I hope these come to more cities!
Ö
Love the videos!!!!
Please pick meee!!!! I love u sooo much
This looks so fun!!

I love Amazon but this really is next level
I like the idea, but the execution, hmmmm. always a great video from Hope <3
