Wahooo!

5 degrees in north west england, so not expecting any snow here, load of bolocks all this talk of snow.
Nooooooooo.  Gotta drive a class 1.  Hopefully them motorways are gritted heavily.
frightening 0.2cm of snow in Inverness - which melted immediately after it stopped - there will be just rain folks - this is just for drama
Isle of Wight today sun was out and it was very warm by lunchtime was nice to feel the sun on you after floods of rain these past could of days
'No, there won't be a hurricane hitting the south coast ....... '   Michael Fish 1987,  just before the Great Storm.
Man said 15th on trending  😂😂😂
BOSTO TO EVERYONE LISTENING 😁
There goes my Sunday plans. Home bound 😂🔐
PLEASEEEEE I REALLY WANT SNOW IN LONDON.
Snow good asking me , I don't know 😕
Once again the West gets none :(
Press the Panic Button! It's called Winter. 🙄
pog
Brace yourselves, a bit of snow coming to London so the MSM will bleat on about it in the news for days!
Duh it’s winter you expect snow ❄️
Hm i wonder if this man is a friend of Matt hancock-------
I go by what my grandad taught me. "If you want to know what the weather is like, look out of the window! If it's a really pretty pink mixed with a bit of purple and it's winter, chances are there will be snow within a week so wrap up warm when you go outside!"
Its been a lovely day here Saturday in SW no rain or snow so far, sunny and reasonably  mild for this time of year. Clouds gathering in the evening, so rain or snow could happen over night.
Its amber because the South East of the country is getting the white stuff.... you get snow anywhere else and its hardly makes the news.
All these daft twats (weathermen ) do is just look out the window and have a guess , then the MSM papers mak some stupid story up of artic Armageddons on the way just to sensationalise the front page , which makes a change from printing false COVID deaths . Just go outside if it’s raining it’s raining , if it’s snowing it’s snowing just get on with it .
Sound like England & Scotland make up the UK
who is excited about this news??
No snow here south east?
So excited for this!  I've been waiting all winter for snow, so far only had rain.
its going to snow in London uk
Talking crap again.snow snow snow.ok if you say so
Rain only :(
I live in the Amber warning area (for Sunday and Monday.) Yay
Why is this trending thou?
Bit of snow in the south east of the country:   The news; BEAST FROM THE EAST 2 IS COMING, AMBER WARNING, A WHOLE 10CM!!!!!!
Naa remember in 2011 and 2012 when winter meant definitely snow... and now look at it.
I want thunderstorm
How many subscribers can I get from this comment  Current 66
But wait didn't BBC and all those liberals try to force indoctrinate us to believe that the snow will disappear because of Global Warming???
Will the snow actually stay in London for more than a day?😭
When they tell you it's going to snow you know then that it really isn't.
Dont worry guys it melts quick that southern fairy snow.
Alex even though you have nor earned this, you are anoying as Jeremy Kyle.
Thought we're not supposed to get snow anymore! O" and please don't forget its a £200 fine for even contemplating a snow ball fight or snowman building! Let alone going sledging!
I am a weather tracker myself and I’ve never seen anything like this. I also live in Colchester
As per normal there’s been no preparation by the council, no gritter trucks, no salt being prepared, good ole Britain shutting the door after the horse has bolted, bit like the Covid pandemic!
Sitting here on the east coast of USA wondering how I got here.  At least I'm informed now.
Liar
🏸
Yay I live in Arbroath but,.. oh well it’ll be frozen snow when it’s just solid
Let's go live in Ipswich looks I'll getting my sledge out
Bout time we snow. I was getting bored of our average seasons. Yano dull average summers n winter finally snow at winter yay hopefully Spain will visit England in summer!
So sick of how we always miss out on everything good, weatherwise, in the central belt of Scotland. No hot weather, EVER, in the summer. And even when it snows in other parts of the UK, we seldom get any. We don't even get thunderstorms in summer, either. So we somehow always get the worst of everything.
Really more snow!!!! 😠😠 Can't wait for summer.
All of Scotland as expected and North East England. Normal Winter forecast.
Kent and Essex and maybe South Suffolk; the rest of England wait till next year.
You say snow , snow , snow i get rain more rain then ice
I won't believe this until it arrives.    They have not been right for years
It's not fair we haven't had any real snow in the North Midlands, east anglia doesn't deserve it.
London: ahh yes finally some snow
We still use miles and "Miles Per Hour" why can't we have "Inches". My age group was brought up with imperial measurements. I cannot visualise 10cm of snow. But I can visualise 6 inches...
That’s the country coming to a halt then👎
Thats right screw the rest of the country, just focus on the London area
Ah southern england snow. It will be worse that ever🤣🤣
A few days ago the weather forecast said 100% chance of snow. There was no snow.  Ever since 1987 and Micheal Fish's infamous "there will be no hurricane" statement, the forecasters overhype the slightest chance of bad weather.
Once again the greedy south east getting all the snow
That kills global warming haha next
Can't enjoy it out then enjoy it indoors all cosy and lush keep toes warm all .
My dad told me if it's sunny on Candlemass (2nd Feb) winter is coming and if it's horrible winter is gone. Candlemass this year was horrible weather.
It’s winter, let’s have a good cccold winter for once. ☃️
Can't wait!! I love the snow and we are house bound anyway so enjoy it!!!
Living in south London and hoping to get the sledge out for the first time in years.
OMFG snow in the south of England. The world will end, the country will be in crisis and a national emergency will be declared. Quick Captain Manwaring call out the Home Guard.........
I'm getting ready for the snow ❄ 🤪.  Just been down to the shed to get 2 tennis rackets to put on my feet.  Can't wait for the 3 snow flakes to grind everything to a halt
Birmingham? WaAaA
thank you Alex
Get ready folks. We may get a sprinkling of snow. Motorways closed, power cuts, food shortages (don't forget to stock up on bog rolls), dead people left lying in the streets, queues at Dover etc. etc. We've always had weather, but nowadays it seems to come with a warning. I think it stems back to Michael Fish telling us there was not a hurricane coming. So now we are warned of all possibilities so no one can say that  they were not warned.
Messers Johnson , Whittey  and Handoncock say the snow maybe , could be , probably , if , when , possibly ,  next week , tomorrow , summertime , 2023 or one jab maybe two jabs  , 12 weeks apart or even 6 weeks apart ,all agree the snow will be white.
Hull best get some
So no snow for South Wales? 😢
"It’s going to turn colder everywhere across the UK" stands in front of Wales for the whole video
It's brass monkey weather oot there 😂😂😂
This is great!  I did not know the Met Office had a forecast on YouTube.  I already use the Met Office Weather App (which is THE best).  I'll be viewing these forecasts regularly from now on
Any snow reaching Lancashire, nw UK?
It's been peeing of rain in Glasgow for two days solid now. The only snow is on the hills and I am not happy about that. Time for the snow dance I think.😃🙅🙆🙅🤷🙆🤷🙅🤣🤣
...make sure any snow-men (people) are Covid-19 compliant and don't upset bin/rubbish collection operatives
When will it ever snow in Devon
I’m literally in the amber warning....
STOP HYPING ALL THIS UP  AS NEED TO GET OUT OFF MY HOUSE THIS WEEKEND AS HAD ENOUGH OF ALL THIS CRAP
Come to South Wales no snow, just rain 🚗🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿☃️
I doubt we get any we  hardly ever do
Could there be Amber for the whole of London
Excellent delivery of weather forecast no more mumbling or whispering. You have improved 100%. Thank you.👍
All snowmen to be at least 2 metres apart. You’ve been warned.   ☃️◀️ 2metres▶️☃️
Hope Worthing gets a dumping but it doesn't look promising according to the graphics...always miss out right on the coast
Don't forget to mask your snowman 0🤪
They always get it wrong where i live😅
Also blizzards and terrible driving conditions are forecast but i bet ya the police will still be out looking for people to fine for daring to play in the snow :(
I hope we do get loads of snow I LOVE IT ( I'll be hiking in the woodland if we do ) 🙏 👍 󾓪
Can we just have the snow and not the wind please, cold snowy and still would be perfect. You can have an easterly airflow with strong winds you know.
Yes mate
Ok then
Whos making a snow man
Cracking job guys - keep up the great work:)
Heavy snow... pathetic.
Let's see if it shows anywhere near lo don the world will know.snow up in the northwest it wont even get a mention on the tv
So that's 70 in the shade on Sunday then.
Only here to see how wrong these idiots get it, whatever they say expect different, one minute i'm told it will be dry, less than 24hr later, peeing down. Useless.
Who cares
The last cold weather we could ever have in the south-east (due to climate change), is going out with a bang!
Live right in that amber warning zone, looks very promising
Thanks fart mclaugh
No snow in West Wales!👎
Get out of the way man.. I cant see the South West
Amazing. We've got weather.  Thought it was called climate change these days.
WAITT- SOUTH EAST- SNOW?
Would love it to dump aload in Cambridge
Looks like central south coast will miss out again
Really hope it heads over Liverpool love snow
Is it just me...when they mention "Yellow Snow"? That old joke about not eating it sails through my unfiltered head....lol
Exciting!!
