Qro meu dinheiro de volta garai meu game pass n t indo
I just realize that christo was in spiderman NWH post credit as the bar man
(He calls himself the getaway driver)
The car still ain't in the game and that's disappointing
best car game in the world
How does this relate to fh5?
Yo trabaje en ese comercial, lo filmamos en Veracruz
This game?
Forza horizon 5 movie xd
Melhor jogo do x box de 2021 ❤️🔥
I really enjoyed this trailer.
Who else came from NWH mid-post credits?
Omg it’s the guy from squid game
Why isn’t this car in the game tho …?

This was the perfect Forza Horizon 5 trailer! The music, that skeleton guitar strum, the acting, everything was perfect. The marketing team really knew what they were doing!
Reeeee so good
Ngl the cars looked slow in this video.
Day 1 purchase! 🏎
It's today boys
Karol G?
I loved it
That was amazing
1:40 It’s the Ford Anglia vibes all over again!
What about an open world driving simulator with an actual storyline and characters versus this arcade BS?
Dani Rojas, Dani Rojas

Pretty good trailer.
El peor comercial que vi en mucho tiempo

Isnt this the footballer from ted lasso movie???
Ich bin dabei!
Now THAT was incredibly well done.
Nice trailer I enjoyed it
DANI ROJAAS???
Eh, this trailer disappoints me. This should use in-game footage. It's like you don't have confidence in the product. Also, it's a little misleading to not make it crystal clear it's not in-game footage.
This trailer was better than the whole fast and furious 9
3 days
1 more day, so excited
I played the previous games, and now I will see the new things that await us.

Tsurus tuneados -El videojuego
This made me notice how much I want an 80’s themed fast and furious movie. Or any car movie centered around the 80’s.
This will be the least immersive Forza in history. Luckily it's a fantasy video game.
Please let there be more old vw cars🙏
J'attends le 9 novembre avec impatience !
Dani Rojas
Don’t really want another racing game…..just kidding this freaking trailer changed my mind in 1s

This was so refreshing to see. It reminded me of the time when commercials were actually fun to watch and had skill and artistic vision behind them and not just PR bullsh*t. This was such an amazing video, loved it!

At first glance thought that was Michelle Rodriguez
Not gonna play this at launch as I'm occupied with Shadow of the Tomb Raider but will probably get it later on. Looks pretty neat, great job on the commercial! 😁👌
They really want to be game of the year with everything they've done to it   .  i  <3 it !
Starting the countdown ! 🤟👍🎮
Wow, the game looks better than the ad!!!
I'm gonna drive that BMW in the streets like this video xD
Love it when Xbox does these live action trailers - I miss the Halo ones but am hoping there may be one for Halo Infinite before it releases
Nacho Libre vibes when the song played

GOTY
Ted Lasso DLC?
1:43 i need one this =D
Wish we had the options to use your garage cars to race personalised grids in custom races, & drive FH3 style ai convoys with your garage cars! And have arrangeable multicar display garages for forzavista.
🚗👍
Olé, spot guapísimo💪
💥💥💥
Xico 💯
Love it! especially with that e28 🥳
i don't mind such videoscenes for FH5/FH6 /FH7 campaign mode (like in first NFS MW game)
Cars 4
we want the nissan tsuru
The location transitions are like in my dreams lol
Totalmente na pilha por essa parada!
Vamos! Can’t wait 😍
I don't know the lore but I know I like the gameplay
I will be playing. Just not in Trans Mode. 😂 I Drive Straight.👍
The red car was BMW so maybe we will see more of them
Should have the choice to race the cars you want by allowing opponent cars to be individually chosen from the players custom cars. And the ability to ai convoy with selected player cars also!  & to have actual garages for more than one car
Yeeyyy,the bochito it's in
Thought this was far cry 6
😍
I love how they randomly switch languages  the moment they start driving
💣💣💣
If only I could find an Xbox series x that’s not sold out
Why are there cars in my "THEY/THEM" pronoun game?
Dale gas padrino! Jajaja tremendo
In the time they made this video they could have made the TSURU
Xbox please, announce the next Dishonored game! please don't let that series die, it was amazing and super underrated!
If you look at 2:08 you can see the different powerbulge hood. Little details make the biggest difference.
Ted would be disappointed in you, Dani. Wasn’t football life?
8 days.. tic tac, tic tac..
