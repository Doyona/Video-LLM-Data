Ha didn’t break the law nor violate the NBA policy. The charge to punish Ja is being led by black docile men. The second amendment protects Ja. Nobody cares what this guys six year old kids thinks.
I was raised the same way. If it has a trigger, i wasn't allowed to play with it. No alien laser, no photon blasters, nothing. Trigger? Yes? Then it's a gun, and you will not play with guns in this house.
A fool and his money shall soon depart, when I was a child I spoke as a child, when I became a man I put away childish things
Ur dumb
RJ’s kid or both of them are gonna be stars one day in the league
You can't fix stupid
Lol house nigga on tv
The Second Amendment trumps whatever a league wants to do. I'm sorry, if you punish this the league must be shut down. This is America.
Ja is finding out that the world is gonna treat you like a grown man instead of waiting for his maturity to catch up to his age and responsibilities.
Is he trying to show that he's still real even though he's making 100 million a year, or is making a 100 million a year making him think he's untouchable?
Send Ja to Aotearoa NZ to hang with Steven Adams for a few weeks. Let Steve-o show him around the homeland and connect with grassroots and watch how a man like Adams carry himself in the community and see the things he does to stay grounded as a human being in his homeland…yes it ain’t America but sometimes you have to step outside the bubble to realise there is more to life out there than what you limit yourself to(in the bubble)…food for thought …👀🥷
People that actually like guns are  the opposite of ja Morant m. Most of them take the rules seriously and carry in secret.
Cap!
Is Jalen rose wearing a toupee?
Oh damn god bless everyone
I'm still in love with Malika. Whatever she says goes lol
Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert and young children, Rick Perry, Mehmet Oz, Kay Ivy, Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Eric Greitens, Michele Fiore and young children, Vicky Hartzler, Andy Ogles...I could go on for hours. There are hundreds of them.
If Ja was at a gun range showing responsible gun ownership Cool 😎. But this fool holds a gun like a 8 year old with hot dog. Gerd lawd.
Dumb comment. Why would Ja's family encourage him to do something that would jeopardize his career and his money? They would be the ones who have the most to lose if Ja loses.
I was following him, but I had no clue what he was talking about when he said, "We know those rules in black households." My pops used toy, bb, and airsoft guns to gradually teach us how to respect & handle guns. We had to prove that we understood basic firearms safety before we were even made aware of the actual firearms around us.
61 games suspension. I've had it. Adam Silver might go nuclear to save the NBA from that major bs.
The black community had very big social problems that won't be fixed until y'all stop thinking white people are the problem. Listen to the music, lifestyle and attitudes and unfortunately it all glorifies nonsense. U have no public enemy's anymore, no artists promoting growth of the community. All they do is glorify gang culture to the point the kids like ja that grew up in the suburbs need to act like this.
RJ:   😑😑😑 Cap 😑😑😑
NBA youngboy needs to give him some tickets.  😅😅
His daughter might be smarter than him.
Young boy got these fools hypnotized!
Grown man saying “Cap” is hilarious to me
How Richard broke this down is crazy accurate and Ja should be embarrassed.
Ja is not a kid anymore. Hes gotta stop being treated as a child and start being treated as an adult
There seem to be a lot of obvious bad decisions going around lately.  The message sometimes comes in the form of "A stiff punishment".
Falsely accused someone of s.a. and still has her job, while also being the mosy disrespected person on ESPN. Wonder why she is? Lol ESPN can't fire her or she'll run screaming sexism, racism, or both. The best part is ESPN Has stopped sending her out to do live interviews because people either walk away from her Or just straight ignore all together because they don't want a false alligator put on them
Aaron herndaze!
Love RJ but I hate that story he told. Come on bro..
Well said by both RJ and Jalen
He needs to be fired from the team and all the other teams should refuse to take him, he's just got the mindset of a wannabe gangsta.
People who really have guns aren’t showing them to strangers on the internet there aren’t toys the only reason you should pull out a gun is to literally survive until then we should never know you even had one
Which is better? Having an NBA career making a quarter of a billion dollars or being a thug with a pistol making minimum wage working at Walmart?
NBA needs to drug test these players more often, immediately after something like this. When they enter the league all well behaved they are given the opportunity to be on the big stage. Some off the bench if team is competent, some start if team is trash which was the Ja case. Let’s not forget. If he landed on any other team the Ja flower wouldn’t of blossomed the way it did. He is either ungrateful or he is living like he has no mom. No offense. Nice for the face of the NRA not the NBA 👀
This guy lives in Memphis. Everybody in Memphis has a gun.
Jalen Rose had the best outlook
Send him back to rehab🤣🤣🤣  man probably signed autographs and bounced.  What a joke all around.
That's the problem kids need not to look at athletes are celebrities as role models bcuz 80% of them are frauds  giving millions billions of dollars  to Satan n being a human puppet for the devil's   NBA is a fraud as well   White supremacist is telling these NBA players not to win games don't make a bucket what team to let win and what player is going to be the king SMH making these guys slap butt
Mind blowing even his little kid knows better hilarious 😆😂😆😂😆😂
somebody should send the RJ's story to Ja... he might learn something, i mean he's got a daughter.
Has this chick ever actually played the game
Suspension 1 year. He played Jalen Rose, team and those who had sympathy for him. Ja has a daughter and is not acting like a father.  .
This kid is having a severe identity crisis.
Kyrie to the Grizzlies.  They’re going to need a starting PG.
Ja saw the All NBA list & was like fuck it! 😂
Imagine if it happens for a third time lol
Ja street like smirk when flashing firearms on social media,”says more than words”
You know you messed up when even a notable gang member ain't happy with your decision making. Stupid games, stupid prizes.
Nba is about to cone dwn hard on him. Hope is learns.
Malika was in the studio 24 hours early for this one. 🤣 Ja trippin.
When under educated celebrities are your role models and the people you look up to then this happens. The media glorifies idiots and gives them platform and the reach. Then why are they so shocked and devastated when a fool exposes his folly?
So no second amendment rights ?
1:35 in black house holds . Interesting.
Jalen Rose should have known that BS interview was a waste of time
Ja you are who we thought you were….a dumb mfer !!
Ja's a clown & His real name is CLARENCE
Stephen A said it best, between Zions body and Ja Morant’s stupidity, RJ Barrett turned out to be the best pick out of the 3
NBA has a problem.   Not a big deal to me unless he uses it to hurt someone.  Not a good look to others.  I get it.
What he did was not illegal. That being said, calling your boss a b***h to their face is also not illegal. I wouldn't do either if I wanted to keep my job tho...
Adam Silver and the Grizz should suspend him for the entire season AND cut his pay. Sponsors should drop him as well. Can’t let kids be looking up to him, he sending the wrong message to young kids especially young black kids.
Malika Andrews the most annoying female in sports entertainment
The act of owning possessing a gun in itself isn't that bad, but the fact that he was punished and had to apologize, and went to get help, and he's still doing it again months later is the problem.
The only way this guy is going to learn when he loses everything, the Nike endorsement and then gets KICKED OUT of the LEAGUE and hanging around the corner shop wondering where did it all go wrong and that’s when he’s GEARS in his brain starts rolling, u really want to be a corner boy well here’s your chance. WHAT A DAMN FOOL💯👀💩💩💩🤣
guns aren't the issue its brandishing it like your a gangster. gangsters murder people
RJ is a beats "CAP"
He really said 🧢 with a straight face 😂😂😂😂😂
My whole thing is what possesses you to grab a gun smile and start waving it when the camera comes out? Like why is that a pose? Ja is an idiot I hope he loses it all.
I thought it was fake news when I heard this. I said, no way can Ja do this again! Didn't he comprehend what's at stake during the first incident? He's blowing a lifetime opportunity and plenty of people in his circle have tried to open his eyes. What could be going through his mind!?
Leave ja alone,in race war yall would be loving it
The difference between Ja and Richard’s kids is parenting.
Kids call it like they see it. There is nothing to analyze, keep it moving.
But Dhillon Brooks is the problem right Memphis 😂😂😂😂😂
he needs the Lord real bad...not just acting like it by going to church or anything like that, but REALLY needs the Lord....the devil's trying to play games with him and he needs Jesus
Anything short of a one year suspension for Ja would make Adam Silver look weak.
Jalen trying to understand NBA young boy fans is like trying to climb out a endless pit.
@3:37, Did RJ say "Cap"? Lol😅😅😅
Him having a gun not even the problem.. him being on social media showing the gun is the only issue... cause 90% of nba players own a gun legally.. I'm sure ja shit legal as well.. it's just like Jalen said the brandishing it
Bro showed his 6 year old the video? Lol
It also goes to show just how swept under the rug his other blunders are. People acting like this is the second time. THIS IS THE 6TH TIME!!!
Richard you had to bring color into this didn't you check the stats on the black on black gun crime and who is more responsible with guns..Im sorry your black and cant have a gun..Gtfoh !
Ja Morant is a moron.
Dillon brooks was the good guy. Ja is the real bad guy
What was Morant arrested for?
RJ:"CAP"😂😂😂
Malika def sad that ja got caught up again😂
For him to do that after the sit down with Jalen, damn.
This a grown ass man not some 16 yr kids stop making excuses
It's not right I'm against guns but yall do realize we live in a country where they make guns ok promote it politicians with their children taking pics with their guns smiling no back lash but the black man he better not just calling out the hypocrisy if it's so wrong to have guns why are they legal I'm just saying ban them if not don't be ahypocrite America culture and conditioning can do alot we always look at folks but let the reasons why off the hook or the system that's obviously being paid off by major gun and lobbiest across the board
Malika andrews has a youtube?! Lol shes a busybody cornball for real.
Can we get Malika Andrew's off NBA coverage? She enjoys these stories too much. Plus after her constant over reaching over exploitation of black men, she disgusts me.
Can you please just dismiss him for the team? Isn’t his the kid who got an opportunity to be recognized during March Madness? Now look at this kid once NBA caved and gave him the opportunity. Wasted. Dismiss him immediately
Rj lies about his kids is the worst take kids in that age are playing Roblox not giving to shits about ja dancing looking like his having fun
People don't want to have the real conversation about the aspects of the culture that creates the kind of mentality that Ja has. What he perceives to be right or wrong or cool or not cool. All of his favourite musicians do the same thing in their videos
He’s definitely gonna need a pistol if he goes to Chicago or Miami lmfao. They don’t play out here. You swing a gun around and play you better be ready to shoot😂
Literally hustling backwards
Let us all remember when you hang out with dummies guess what you become a dummy
Powerade should cut Ja and sign RJ's kids.
Jalen, you lost a lot of credibility.  Stop dyeing your hair - let the gray grow out and be the father figure not the cool big brother.  You should have hit Ja hard with truth not placate and make excuses for him the first time this happens for Public Relations show!!
Never did a 6 year old see a flash of a gun i still cant aee after 25 times wathing it..
Why was he doing that?? "Because he is stupid ""
I don't like black people or basketball, but I really don't see what the big deal is.
"We know those rules in black households"  what does that even mean?
Even in places with the most liberal gun laws . Waving it about in a moving car is reckless behaviour .
Richard Jefferson brainwashing his kids😂😂
Ja Morant is the biggest NBA Youngboy groupie! What a bozo!
Ugh... She makes me want to stab a fork into my ears
Networks like ESPN who have the rights to broadcast the NBA are always going to pussyfoot around situations that make the league look really bad. Hence that interview with Jalen Rose.
Them conversations never happened 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol people act like he shot someone or pointed the gun at someone or threatened to kill someone. Treating him worse than Miles Bridges. World has gotten so soft.
Why is it so difficult??????????  If this would happen to  99.9% of the people in the world with a regular  job in this situation  they would have been fired !!!it is simple fire him!  AND SEND HIM TO COURT! IF HE DID SOMETHING ILLEGAL! AND ANOTHER THING THIS SHOW THE YOUNG YOUTH  YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT A LONG AS YOU HAVE MONEY!  AND FAME!
Steph curry is the greatest shooter of all time Ja morant : *hold my beer*
Richard Jefferson is cappin with that story with his kids
To real drug dealers in America, how do you feel about this?
🧢
This generation is different. In the time of MJ he had the  love of the game clause where he can play pick-up basketball and if injured would not be in breach of the contract for playing basketball (ie love of the game), Kobie too used this clause. Now you'll have the Ben SImmons and Ja Morant clauses maybe in future contracts for rescinding contracts and enforcing damages, tsk...One just has to face the consequences of ones actions only these sticks out it could impact all future contracts of players for the worse.
Hes a gay man stuck in a homophobic culture
Richard is so soft lmfao, looked like he was about to cry. None of his story sounded believable.
Music is more powerful than the people want to recognize. Music puts you in certain moods and molds your behavior. In the 60s and 70s we were singing about love and we had more of it in society. Now if the majority of songs are about a million different ways to shot and kill ni****s that's the type of behavior you're going to get.
Made up story lol
The media narrative is crazy. They’re slowly turning this story into a hit piece at this point and instead of just giving the updates and discussing the potential consequences and observing the situation, they’re turning it personal making things more worse than they actually are.
Ja did nothing wrong or illegal y’all are so sensitive and anti gun in comments it’s sickening. The NBA should not be infringing on 2nd amendment rights Idgaf what ppl say there is nothing in the CBA or player conduct code that says you can’t express your second amendment rights in the offseason and he’s in Tennessee he broke no laws. This is a witch hunt by the anti gun liberal media and NBA making a spectacle out of nothing to push the anti gun agenda and ppl are falling for it they want you to see gun and think criminal thug or proud boy right away. Stephen Jackson shot a gun at someone in a parking lot outside a night club and got suspended only 7 games and had been suspended before for the malice in the palace and JR Smith only 7 games after he killed his friend who was a passenger in his car when he was speeding and blew a stop sign and had many driving violations before and used to throw up gang signs on the court and cuss refs and players out during games. And many many guys with domestic violence who got little or no punishment including Jaxson Hayes last year because he’s not a big name like Miles Bridges they didn’t suspend him at all but this will trigger a lengthy suspension? Complete  Witch Hunt it’s obvious
Jalens changed his tune...
If Ja Morant wants to look intimidating, he should start going to the gym and pump some serious iron and build himself up.  Then he won't need a gun to look tough.
I don't like how not the main part about this is like Hey bro. You can't go around in society flashing guns because people might try to kill you because guns are dangerous and you can't just go flashing them around
RJ 🧢 😂
If I'm the owner of grizz. Will trade his ass in a heartbeat
You never see lamelo ball doing this type of stuff  Is because his dad would put him in check so fast
Shorty wanna be a thug. Let him see what it’s like. Go play overseas with all that
CAP!!! Nuff said.
Guns n dolls wit strollers at a certain age is a no for me 💯👍🏿🎤✅
what a made up story cmon…
Only way Malika can get me to watch her videos is with RJ in the title. I don't rock with her but Richard is my guy 💯
When his kids asked him why Ja Morant would do such a thing, he should have told them that Morant was stupid.
Why did he say that? What is gun policy in a “black household“?
Are we sure there’s no armpit harmed when filming this video?
ESPN or Black Channel
I was in the military for 3 years at a top special forces unit. I know my way with guns too well.  Now, as a cevlian, I don't own one. My conclusion is that I  prefer that somebody potentially will rib my house than I will get into a gun fight.  No good outcome can come from having a gun.
Jas getting owned by children now
lmao this dude is terrified of firearms.
Another wannabe gangster who couldn’t bruise a grape
Nice one RJ ❤❤
Richard Jefferson is a str8 sissy . Str8 clown . I b glad when he sit down. Waste of time his freaking mouth.
JR said it all "CAP" bruh need help. Rough to see. You making mills,so many ppl would love to be in your position yet acting like he getting it out the mud😅
RJ's position is a bit off in the sense he believes a 6 year old can see the wrong. The child is responding to the fact his father has taught him guns are bad (period) and he clearly told his children Ja did something wrong before showings them the video(s). The child is responding to his father's energy. Nothing more....Ja just needs to decide if he wants to be apart of corporate America or Outlaw America.
Jalen Rose gave him a mea culpa because he's black. Just tell it how it is. They would never in a million years support a white athlete who did the same.
I guarantee if he would  have made that All Star just won't have happened.
RJ's dad killed in a drive-by as an innocent bystander.
They about give Ja 50 Games with no pay
1:35 "i dont let my guns play"... well yeah you prob shouldnt lil guy
I'm not ashamed to say I re-watches this entire clip just to hear Richard Jefferson say cap 😂
In other news that never happened..
The first issue of course it's Ja. The second and maybe main issue was the grizzlies & Adam Silva's soft slap on the wrist because they were worried of the dip in viewership if ja wasn't playing.   Now they all look stupid - ja grizzlies and Adam silva. But most especially Adam Silva. Send a message. Suspend him for a season without pay.
Best nba player in history- Tim Duncan Best nfl player in history- John elway Best mlb player in history- mookie Betts Best college basketball player in history- Paul pierce Best college football player in history- bear Alexander Best overall athlete of all those- Tim Duncan
Ja should be suspended for a season. It might save his life.
Season suspension. He will not learn if he will be suspended only for 8 to 10 games. Losing more than 30million for 1year plus commercial endorsements will hurt him so bad that he will learn from this finally. Another violation will be total banishment from the NBA.
Most of the media especially ex-NBA Players, seem afraid to talk about Ja's stupidity so they're being really nice about it, maybe out of fear. LIke Ja needs to be kicked out the league. Rap is cancer to Black communities.
Kick him out of the NBA then he can go hit the streets 4 real … 😂
You asking a 6yr old is that good or bad is funny! Wait til they get older and ask them that same question over again. Stop tryna white wash everything for tv 🫥🚮
Ja Morant turned into Ja Moron.
Jalen got played by Ja getting that fluff piece interview yet Jalen still on TV bringing up whataboutisms with other professions to defend Ja
Nike dropping him by close of business Monday.
Mabe the organization he's with ain't good fit for him Canada would be perfect he knows nobody that team would be great with him just send Fred vanfleet.  Og ananoby. And Jakob poteil   imagine that both teams get better grizzlies roster would be tough.   Fred vanfleet Desmond bane  Og ananoby Jarret Jackson Jakob poteli   Steven Adams  Brandon Clarke Xavier Tillman Luke kennard   Now this is a championship team u got 2 bigs a long wing in ananoby 2 Sharpe shooters bane and fleet and the bench for sharp shooters two and u get better on defense then on raptor side u get a athletic point   siakam. Barnes. Imagine those 3. Morant. Pasko siakam. And Scottie Barnes Morant would average 28. Siakam. 27. Barnes around 25.  Gary Trent coming off the bench 17. I mean come on
Memphis is one of the states that you don't go around playing gangsta.  I'm Still in disbelief that Young Dolph is gone.  That hurt alot of people Ja.  We don't want that to happen to you.
What people aren't talking about is that if Ja is caught twice in months doing this then chances are he's always waving his gun around trying to ACT gangsta. His mental is very adolescent!
The strippers sucked the brains out of Ja Warant. 💋 🧠 😢
sissy
Why is Richard Jefferson not a coach in the NBA? I trust he has the leadership that a young group could use.
WHY IS JALEN WORKING WITH MALIKA??
Jalen still making excuses for Morant. Age has NOTHING to do with this. You know at 23 IT'S  WRONG TO PLAY WITH GUNS....
Mans can’t have a gun tho? If he was hunting would it be okay with the powers that be? If he was videoing his rifles and deer callers would that be okay? 🤔
Steven adams needs to move in with ja😂
If a video were to surface of me flashing a gun in a state or city without a concealed carry law, I would lose my kids.
The League is going to have to now look at this with Potentially with more Severity?? Well I would think So...
Ja should quit basketball and join the crips or start rapping or even join the Police force  he likes guns so much.
Its just a bad look for his employer. A dennis rodman on guns.
Off topic, but surprised the brother Jalen Rose agreed to be anywhere near the toxicity that is Malika Andrews.
Throw him out the league
Bro ja is a grown man you can’t blame his friends ja might be the worst one in the crew. Dude is not a baby
One grizzlies fan needs to step up and take one for the team from ja...let him get it out his system
Ja obviously suffers from ADHD and he needs help managing it.
RJ wanna act like black men flashing guns on screens is a new concept…get real dude
Wanted to watch this but fuck Malika after what she tried to do to Jalen.
I wonder how RJ explains 98% of rap music videos to his kids…”son, idk” lol what a wanker
I'm just waiting on the inevitable surge of conservative Republican support as a Black person, whom they've always protected and supported and cared about, exercises his American 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.
Ja is a moron, suspend him for a year
I was like why he got kids so young 😩 I thought homie was old as Michael Jordan
Jordan was a drunk/smoking/gambling individual back then. I dont see any difference with JA holding a gun when your constitution says you can.
Ja is mentally I’ll and a fool.
RJ kept it REAL
“I don’t let my guns play with kids.”  The most gangsta thing RJ ever said
Jalen the same person in California voting soft on crime. Clown take. Who the fuck cares about how this impacts the Grizzlies. Should have the same insight as RJ, how this impacts and influence the youth.
Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
fuck the money and all that, just pray this kid doesnt end up shot, killed or harmed by his actions. flashing and playing with guns all i takes is one mishap.
iI brains were dynamite, Ja wouldn't even blow his ears off.  What an elite moron.
Only person Ja foolin wit all that cappin is himself, cuz ain’t nobody with any sense believed what he said to Jalen Rose.
Richard Jefferson did u tell your sons why u fingered ol girl’s armpits?! 🤔 did u show them that ?!
Richard Jefferson💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Why is Ja being handled with all this special care??? The dude had a good upbringing with 2 parents. He has an active father in his life and he’s a multimillionaire. Stop talking to and about Ja like he’s some special needs person. He’s a fucking moron period point blank. These media members never spoke gently and nicely about Kyrie like they do with the idiot Ja Morant. Tell me I’m lying
Y’all afraid to talk about the EVIL MUSIC AND CULTURE  While I was raised in church, I was still exposed to the world and went through hard times being a part of the “culture” EVERONE in prison loved that music
RJ know his kids ain’t say all that. NBA must’ve paid him to say that 😂
So Jalen Rose, who got fooled badly by Ja in that absurd interview, says if Ja was in another profession, like a entertainer, he would be cheer leaded for his videos. Wow, that tells you how bad the culture has gone.
RJ taking out his ass. Kids do NOT say 'that was a bad decision' this word 'decision' keeps coming up. Ja is being an a**hole wanna-be thug. Stop putting words in your kids mouth to push your own 'bad example' narrative. Be better RJ.   NBA: Take Ja to visit and talk with mothers of young children who have died due to gun violence.  NBA: Take Ja to visit and talk with parents of kids killed in school massacres that keep happening in your country.  Ja also left his wife and kid. Dude is basically a Narcissistic a**hole.
Rj doing some good parenting
Give him 2yrs.
I love RJ but you know damn well his 8 year old kids don't have grown conversations like that hahahah
I love the rich jeff guy
When Peer Pressure Hits again😂
RJ basically said Ja is one hell of an idiot😂😂😂
Media taking this too far
I think that’s the weirdest thing. It’s inexplainable.
RJ lost all credibility when he acted like his kids weren’t sure who Ja Morant is?
He bout to get traded to the Hornets in exchange for Lamelo and Rozier 😂😂
Ja is 23.  That’s not a kid anymore.  The first time he got into trouble was his chance for growth.  And here we are in a society where many individuals are motivated to feel like “victims.”  Imo, Ja is very “privilege” to have been given a chance bc players like Myers Leonard didn’t get a second chance.  Crazy
Jalen looks like he got egg on his face!! Ja played you bro!!💯😑
RJ says CAP....... lol
The NBA can and will move on without this brat
U don't let ur kids play with nerf guns or fake guns? That's scared parenting! Raise your kids right RJ! Teach them about guns and be RESPONSIBLE with them! PRAISE GOD for the 2nd Amendment!!!
NBA’s too goddamn dumb. He’s a criminal that’s exactly what he is is a criminal his family thinks he’s Johnny law treat him like a criminal. That’s exactly what he is.
Has Malika addressed situation trying to "me too" jalen rose
Ja is the kind of guy who will shoot himself by accident lol
Ja looks like skinny lesbian, he is the furthest from thug or gangster by any means. It's like real life 8th mile shit. Shut up Clarence u r no thug, just play the game and capitalise on your god given talent
Doesn't Ja Morant have a 2nd amendment right?  God Bless America.
RJ seems like a great father! Hell of a take
Bruh.... you should've asked him some real tough questions fool. Jalen is the..... biggest sellout.
Had the same discussion with my 11 year old about both incidents. Damn shame.He reacted the same way as Richard Jefferson's kids. So, why can't Ja think before the stupidity occurs.
All that BLM talk and your star brandishing guns and glorifying gang violence, black on black crime. The hypocrisy!
Man I’m so disappointed in Ja. He was the next Damian Lillard for me. I thought he was the next killer in the league but he’s another fizzled out star at this rate from BAD decision making. It’s a damn shame because he’s so talented. But no talent in the world can make up for behaving this way as a role model and face of the league. I hope he really finds his way. I truly hope he does. He still has potential to do great things and still be a good person.
I think it's obvious what happened. The dude gets drunk/high and does stupid things. He does not have a "gun problem". He has a substance problem. He even says it. "That person is not me". Dude needs a serious intervention. Hope he finds his way, because he is bleaping electric to watch.
It's always more powerful to make points through stories. Good one RJ
This woman has aged so much since taking this job from Rachel nichols. Yikes!
rj spittin man
The fact that little kids get and not a grown man it’s ridiculous
RJ better be careful Malika gonna cancel him too 😂
Let’s be clear. Jalen, when you sat down with JA. It was not his first time
Playing with guns gets people killed. Whether by accident, or being part of a bad scene, or just being an idiot. He can’t be let into arenas at this point, nor his group.
Don't worry, when the money's all dried up and his so-called friends who are probably PRAYING for his downfall (out of jealousy of course) disappear, then he'll see the light! But it'll be way too late by then....
With so many mass shootings happening this guys behaviour is so dangerous as he is an influence to a lot of children
Ja if you watch in this my dude Jefferson lettin you know what it is
Wtf is Jalen talking about??? You’re saying if Kevin Hart was doing all the same stuff we would be celebrating him??? What a nut job this guy has become.
This dude is failing at being a Dad to his own kid and as a father figure to all these street dudes in the MTown who look up to him. All the violence and shooting in the MTown and he doesn't realize he might be contributing to the mindset to youth in the city.
He's not going to play for The Memphis Grizzlies again.
Ja morant is the antonio brown of the NBA
Cap - rj. 😂
RJ is eloquent. This was deep
Also bullshit, role model is not part of your job, that is on the parents.
Is Ja still getting that 33.5 Million a year 194 Mill guaranteed? What does he care about sitting out?
ESPN pushing their leftist narrative again. The first time Morant was wrong because he broke league rules. This time, it is the offseason & he has the right to protect himself. So fuck off ESPN 7 all other anti-gun morons
“That’s not me the person you see in the video is not me” RJ : Cap
Jalen Rose continues to act like Ja Morant is a young kid. He is the worst kind of parent to ever have. He tries to be everyone's friend instead of an actual parent. And then wonders why Ja Morant keeps doing the things he does. Its clear as day  he has no guidance whatsoever and his father was a failure.
Malika got wet when she realized another black man has messed up
Ja Mo: thats not me in the video…again denying. That is my Parents way of raising me😂 or that’s probably Dillon😂🤣👏🏻🤭
Can't fix stupid 😂😂😂
My 2 cents on this just be a rapper or something where they don’t care about u waving a gun on live since u love it so much 💀
Let’s be honest for a second, did anyone know that RJ has kids??
If JA plays basketball in China in his prime??, he will make new history.
Ja is young but he's also a father. He knows better.  He just doesn't care about his image. He has a pattern of bad behaviors.
🧢 RJ reading a script! So u asked your kids about this?? After u didn’t even want to watch? Stop being a puppet fam. Your answer was what you had to read 😂
They should suspend him for the whole year stop pussy footing around, NBA has the chance to make a statement and stand by it. Will they, nope…
You literally just said you don’t let your kids play with any kind of gun and you don’t have guns in your house. That’s why they know it’s a bad decision. You raised them that way. Ja clearly wasn’t raised that way.  We have guns in my house. My children know about them and know the dangers of them. It’s all about what you teach your kids.
Should have had that 6 year old interview Ja Morant
RJ- "CAP" 😂😂😂😂
RichardJefferson's Kids: Why he do that? RichardJefferson: I don't know RichardJefferson's Kids: Why he do that? RichardJefferson: I don't know ....repeat 20 more times...
😂😂😂 why is Richard Jefferson lying his ass off about his kids 😂😂
Lol Jalen still trying to defend Ja Morant! . Dude is being played like a piano
Damn the NBA is really missing David Stern
"thats not me" "CAP"
"De JA Vu", it happened again
Ja hustlin backwards
I won’t be watching any Malika andrews related content. I will comment tho. cheers 🍻
He could have a gun he Don't have no felonies
Grizzlies should void his contract and just build around bane and jackson jr. Ja is not worth the headache for any team. No serious basketball team will want to be associated with thuggish behaviour no matter how good that player is.
Grizzlies back on the phone with Dillon brooks like, did we say Under no circumstances? 😂😂
He's not gonna change that's for sure
Nodisrespect to KD but give me that ja Dawg on Call a duty character package.😊😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
First off, not having to carry a gun because you have the peace of mind of safety is a privilege. Most Americans that live below the middle class don't have that privilege
Don’t blame his parasitic friends.  Blame the parasitic parents!  And blame the 24 year old retard
STRAIGHT 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
JA …. Go see Deerhunter and wear a red headband with ur buddies
Ja Morant is 23…he isn’t some 18 year old who is goofing up. He is a grown man. We baby these dudes so much.
Lost a lot of respect for Jalen.  He lobbed questions to Ja during the rent-a-repent sham--thinking he was helping the young man, instead of talking to him like a man.
so he just lost millions of dollars coz he wasnt part of any All-NBA team... then he gon lose more millions for team and league suspensions, and getting dropped by his Nike and Powerade deals... this is why parents need to be parents to dumb kids... and dumb rich kids need to be checked for pretending to act like they from the hood and the streets. this ja is a fucking clown of epic proportions
Malika loving this shit
He was dancing to music,like come on bro,who did he kill,no one 😂
Jalen Rose on Phil Jackson-“When people show you who they are, believe them!!” Jalen Rose on Ja Morant- “Hes young”
Ja Morant is 23 and for some it takes more time to mature. Lucky for him is even if he goes broke. There's always a NBA pension. Or he can get a goofy job with Steven A as a co-host 😂
All I want to know is.... where's Ja?
Was this act illegal?
Respect. 👍
Morant is the definition of a fucking clown 🤡
Man tell your sons he’s Goofy stop acting like you don’t know what’s going on.
Thats was a lie
I agree to what RJ said. My teen boys said "Ja is Confused for his age"😂 my 18yo son is entering to College as Architecture the other one will take Political Science as pre law and will study Law after college. They told me they will not ruin their lives for bad influence friends. But my boys love playing basket ball they admire Lebron, Kobe, MJ and Steph 😂❤
JR LITERALLY shared that for JA to hear that two kids knew better than him.
There are a lot more pressing issues then Ja. Schools shot up, economy, and global tensions. News outlets  sweep the wrong stuff under the rug.
🧢🧢🧢
The message should have been received when he signed that contract Jalen. You just embarrassed that he was lying to you in that bullshit interview 😂. I wonder what is his plan B because he will need one soon. What an idiot SMH
Blame the Whore Mom and the Fanboi Dad. Fuck them
What in the fake news is going on here? This is a gun grab, and this has left wing propaganda written all over it.
richard jefferson interpreted his statement exceptional! He SAID MY KIDS KNEW WHAT HE was doing. On camera 🎥 wrong at six years old facts!
Morant is overrated anyways. Team plays better without him. Grizzle’s got lucky if the nba kicks him out and voids his contract. Shoulda just offloaded him before this shit happened this season.
Holy shit Jefferson got me dying 🤣
I appreciate RJ’s story about his kids because I’m tired of people saying Ja’s young. He’s an ADULT, he’s a FATHER, and I know most people wouldn’t do this at any age.
*1993* *El* *Monte* *Pool* *Hall* *Shooting* People should watch that 1993 El Monte pool hall shooting between Asian gang bangers. I saw this back in the mid-90s when Fox would cover gangs. I'm watching the shooter's interview, China Dog, and my has he changed! Dude is probably what? 48? Darker and looks nothing like his mug shot.   Ja Morant is reminding me of "Kicker", the Cambodian dude who was showing off his 45 only to get tackled from behind by China Dog and basically got killed by his own gun after getting capped in the head twice under a pool table. You can not act boastful in front of people. There is always going to be a crew much stronger than your crew with even heavier artillery.   I was about 13 when that pool hall shooting happened on December 3, 1993. Happened a day before my 13th birthday. But after you see how remorseful China Dog is and I believe he got freed 3 years ago, is any of this gangsta sh*t worth it? A dude got killed because he was mad dogging another rival gang and was boastful he had a gun! Stupid sh*t like that gets you killed!   After that El Monte shooting, a Filipino from Asian Boyz (ABI) orchestrated the Summer of Madness. A retaliation that would kill 8 people. Marvin Mercado AKA Shy Boy would hide in the Philippines 🇵🇭 for years. He's now become super religious. You can find a photo of him looking clean-cut and is part of a church group in prison. He looks nothing like he did in the 90s just like China Dog looks so so clean-cut after 30 years.   Does Ja know Tupac got killed by trying to act thuglife? I know Ja was born after Tupac got killed but does he understand the consequences trying to be this macho tough guy by waving around a gun? Wake up, Ja. Do you really want to be shot dead like Tupac, Biggie, and Nipsey the moment you mess with the wrong people? Real gangsta mfers.   Ja has to be the dumbest mfer I've ever seen. None of this gangsta sh-t is worth throwing your whole life away. I'm subbed to Michael Franzese, Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, and watch Johnny Chang (ex-Wah Ching) on YouTube. They know the gangster life. They've become good people. It's not worth it, Ja. Live square and nerdy like Bill Gates and enjoy your life and money. Start looking like that corny, middle-class kid again. Poser.   NEVER BROKE AGAIN YOUNGBOY is turning Ja Moron into a BEING BROKE AGAIN DUMBBOY. Nobody is scared of his little gun carried by his 3-inch biceps. A corny, wanksta mfer who would rather dance in TikTok videos and wave a gun on IG Live instead of being a rich, professional basketball player. A true dumbass in every sense of the word.
Meh, Morant is a star. The NBA and the Grizzlies will go soft and cater to Morant no matter what happens. And Morant will laugh all the way to the bank, as he's done so far in his short career.
It's disturbing how sport's analysts like Richard Jefferson and Michael Wilbon keep using the term Role Model, no athlete especially in today's world should be anybody's Role model, parent's have to teach their Kids that, Ja Morant don't represent anybody but the wannabe Hood life
On some gangsta shit JA need to get DP’d😂
so who's gun was it? lmao
Ya I want to talk shit on him but won’t his childish behavior gonna cost him his nba carrer
So what law did he break?
These are basketball players not Nobel prize winners. If a basketball player is your child’s role model you have bigger issues. But yes what he did was stupid
Malika is bleaching like Sammy Sosa
The NBA needs to quit acting like there the police. This should be a police matter, and they need to hand it over to the police before someone eventually gets hurt or killed by his actions. No one's even talking about does he even own a gun license to be carrying a gun? Owning a gun or carrying a gun comes with a big responsibility, which clearly he wasn't taught, just saying 🤗
Where's the candid conversation? No analysis at all.  It's simple, this delinquent needs a complete season suspension. Proving to be the gotdamn Michael Jackson of ball.
Ja Morant is a punk!
Ja has a daughter .setting an example includes more than buying her the world...girls need their Dads to set examples of what good men do! Praying for his baby girl🙏🏼
RJ 😂😂😂 really sitting up there lying
You know Jalen is upset because his painted hairline is slightly off center….😮‍💨
If I'm the Commish --- one/third of the season!  This dude is just STUPID!
NBA CHECK IT OUT WHEN PPL SHOW YOU WHO THEY ARE BELIEVE THEM! FINAL CUT
Literally Rj thank you bro no excuse for a grown man coming from someone of the same skin Tone and age
RJ straight up calling out Ja's folks, but in a roundabout way, lol.. Well played sir.
If the league can give oj mayo a lifetime ban for smoking weed they got to ban ja for at least a year or something
Silver is far too soft on the Players when it comes to discipline. It is good that he supports the players on social progress issues but the league needs to stop giving players minimal suspensions. At a time when Americans have a daily count of gun violence that is akin to an ESPN scoreboard there needs to be lengthy suspensions for even first-time offenders.
cap
Funny no one mentioning the kids in the car because they're still trying to protect his behavior and image
Ja just needs better friends. It’s obvious they aren’t looking out for him. If I got paid 200 million dollars and all I had to do is not play with firearms, sign me up. Dude is ruining his life with all these toxic people around him.
good on ESPN, but c'mon, you expect me to believe that RJ story? LOL
On to more pressing topics. RJ I know you seen all the clips of you bashing the Lakers when Perk said they could make it to WCF. Explain yo self..
Ja Morant      NBA    PLS    Don't  give  3rd   CHANCE ,,,,,,, HE IS BAD   4 da GAME  WE LOVE   NBA............ period......................
“He said gun and he rhymed it with FUN!” -Chris Rock
I think he should be allowed to have a gun...we all know he can't shoot
Great player needs serious help🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 love to ja
CAP 😂😂😂😂😂
I don't get why Ja's friends keep filming him when they know he's holding a gun? Like are you trying to screw over Ja?
Who is in the video this time?   Another Immature  Misguided Kid with Braids?  Hope Ja Morant gets over this unscathed.
I laughed when RJ said you know black households we don’t play with guns. Lmaoooo that had me dying laughing I’m sorry
Oh now malika wants some severe punishment. If it was a woman sleeping with a head coach no accountability in sight.... Shes unbelievable
It’s also not a good look for a league that wants to grow internationally, as guns are not legal to own in many countries outside the US.
Malika is enjoying every minute of this on the inside
NGL i really don't wanna hear shit that Ja has to say.  we all know it'll be nothing but lies
Sad that Ja Morant can't seem to stay out of trouble now his NBA career may actually be in jeopardy!
Jalen should stop talking for a while and reflect
Some friends Ja have.
Even a 6 year old know thats a bad decision wow!
This is why Lamelo is the next face of the league
Jalen rose always has his hip hop reference. I’ll give him one. “NO! HOV DID THAT, SO HOPEFULLY YOU WOULDNT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT”
THE USA MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOT ONLY THE NBA...the USA is having trouble with mass shootings and yet a professional basketball player just doing his shit like its normal?...WAKE UP AMERICA!😢😢😢
I forgot RJ was that old 😮
You know Malika wants to go in to try to tear another bro down but after that Ibaka ordeal she stirred up she's been  leashed by her handlers. OR is she not triggered because it's not to do with some thot throwin her platypus around the office, getting what she wanted, then being excused of any wrongdoing or ACCOUNTABILITY after the you know what hits the fan? I could be wrong tho.
RJ definitely lied about that story!😂
it seems Ja is a misguided 5 year old.... he thinks John Wick is a real person...
I have 3 kids. Older and young. This doesn't sound realistic from a parent stand point. They see guns in movies video games and in the stores. Let's stop playing perfect person. Ja morant was wrong and needs to be suspended, but I'm tired of everyone's perfect life story to counter Ja decisions.
Jaylen go through a can of Bigen a day!
Ja Morant have a GOD complex that why he thinks he is untouchable. Isn't he the same guy that called himself black Jesus?
He’s clearly still a kid. The league needs to suspend him for the season without pay
Unfortunately those rules you mention don’t apply when you abuse the privilege we all have in a negative view and our future children become confused as much as our society has so much negativity we are facing in our country.
Did he commit a crime? Last I checked it is not illegal to carry a gun.  We are all quick to kill this man. This is Memphis Tennessee... you better have a gun
RJ  WITH  ( 🧢)
Did richard jefferson accidentally say he has guns in the house and then change the sentence?😅 @1:34
guns are legal, why is he in trouble for having one?
I’m hoping that this is not inner pain 🙏🏾🇦🇬🇺🇸
Rose looking like a weird dude to me. You see the way he's holding his hands like the food guy from tick tock. These guys don't know to be themselves. Richard Jefferson you can tell is being himself
Ja please understand who you are 🇦🇬🇺🇸🙏🏾
That's the part I disagree with that notion that black households shouldn't be able to have guns isn't in the second amendment like that's the part I'm not getting like does the man have a gun license? Is it open carry where he lives at? People ask these questions or just black man with the gun is a no-no
Kids got slaughtered jist 2 weekends ago outside a mall!! Amd this IDIOT is jamming out to rap music while playing w a gun like a child!!!! And he's a "parent " himself I guess.... maybe a part time dad! Eitherway!! I'm done w this dumb a@$ loser!!!  Just cause he can dunk!! Middle finger Ja!! Go play with ur buddies
How am I just noticing Malika has a YouTube channel and posts clips from the ESPN show. Boss! Don’t see nobody else really doing that it’s honestly smart, they missing out on a bag! Honestly didn’t even know they were allowed to repost this stuff but I guess it makes sense cause they are in it!
Suspend his dumb ass for a year. But because he’s good at basketball it’s ok.
I think this is good bye . We’ll see him play over seas
Bro going wish he didn’t try be gangsta when the real street niggas start robbing an jacking this nigga
Rj was speaking facts as a father
Ja Morant is still getting off easy, there's nothing going on anyways with the Grizzlies, it's almost like being suspended on the last day of school.
Sad to say but 76 is getting the Suns coach
🤣🤣 Did RJ say "Cap?" 🤣 😏
Damn RJ might as well send the country and check with the amount of pandering he was doing....he wants that disney daddy money
Ja has a identity crisis, he wants to be a rapper so bad it might cost him his career or his life  !
I can’t believe Ja is goin the clown route. Boi bout to flush is whole career down the drain
I'm with RJ on this rant. You can't be doing this with kids looking up to you.
wheres Rachael. this new one has a victim mentality
I just feel bad for Ja throughout all this and especially his daughter.   Also RJ’s kids burned the fuck outta Ja😂
If the NBA wants to send a message, suspend him for a season.
Ja Maront, your Gen Z ambassador 👏🏿
AN NBA OWNER WAS ARRESTED FOR DONESTIC ABUSE  AND DIS NOT RECEIVE THE PUNISHMENT JAH MORANT IS RECEVING
Fuck your channel
Jalen Rose really trying to be Top G so bad
Jalen sounds hurt
Kids sound yt🤦🏾‍♂️
Maybe their being to harsh on Mr. Morant.
Rap music video fantasy.  Modern rap is such a negative influence. Think he would’ve felt inclined to wave a gun around had they been listening to The Isley Brothers? #no
Ja Morant won't learn his lesson from a suspension, he should be kicked out of the league, but hey NRA gets a free advertisement.
Ja aka NBA DUMB BOY
Well said RJ!!!
I get what RJ did but I find it hard to believe this actually happened not saying it didn’t just hard for to believe it did
1. MARV ALBERT WAS ARRESTED FOR FELONY FORCIBLE  SODOMY 2.JASON KIDD WAS ARRESTED  FOE DOMESTIC BATTERY 3.KOBE BRYANT WAS CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND FALSE IMPRISONMEBT WHAT HAS JAH MORANT BEEN ARRESTED FOR?
How can Jalen be on stage with that woman who tried just a few weeks ago to end his TV career.
Even gangbangers aren’t that irresponsible with guns
Not only is he fumbling his bag, he’s picking it up and running the way..😂
did richard jefferon say “ black household “ like he not the whitest person on espn
Bro is self sabotaging. I think he needs to talk to someone. Like a therapist
Okay and who gives a shit about RJ son of a course a dumbass kid who’s been brain washed into thinking guns are bad are gonna say some non sense like this 😂
Cap  -RJ
Shut up Richard! 😂
"Me Too" Malika!!!
I hear people trying to use it’s his right. But his contract with the league trumps that. They have an image to uphold. This bonehead is messing with it. Night basketball IQ. Low common sense
This guy is so CAP boy shut up
As always, RJ keeping it 💯 with america. Ja is a 🤡.  Waiving it wildly with no respect for that weapon, he deserves what he gets.
Why was Ja Morant waving a gun ? To show that it's ok to play with guns and to everyone else of all ages should have a gun too. But that is false.
This dude Ja man. Tf. So many dudes in poverty that would give a leg to be where he is, and he just out here trying to trade places
My kids aren't allowed to dance the griddy or whatever the hell Ja'almost dances. And they certainly aren't allowed to have any of his shoes or clothing. We're done with all things related to Ja'thug.
Well said RJ, people with common sense know he's making some dumb decisions.  People think it's a law thing and are completely ignoring the fact that the companies are rewarding him handsomely for not being in those situations and he consistently disregards that for some street cred, it looks stupid af
who tf calls their kid son
LMAO RJ "CAP" 🤣😂😁
His mom is gonna have to ground him.
3:38 😆😆😆😆
There were signs, the crew waiving guns after a game, the strip club, the threats at his home, the "I'd cook MJ" the "I'm good in the West."  He's been showing signs of being nowhere near reality
Because he's black son. He's a kindergarten dropout son. He's smarter than a rock son. You should look up to rappers and athletes son. You'll really go far in life.
Yes, you are THEE CEO of you
NBA ain’t above the Constitution #2ndAmendment
You could easily tell that he was bsing in that Jalen Rose Interview.
Lol sounds like rj has a couple of responsible gun owners on his hands. Well, future gun owners lol. Ugh and ofc he had to make that little remark about their race. Ffs man not everything has to do with fucking race!! These gd race grifters are actually damaging our society. When you always play the race card to excuse behavior or to blame for someone breaking the law and getting in trouble etc, people actually start to believe it and it just creates tension and racial hatred. Stop this shit for the love of god
Off of Jalen response, I can see why Molly left his ass. 🤡
When RJ went “cap” I was waiting on Jalen to say “What” 😂
BRUH 🙄 STFU, this is a bad example yo kids ain't come from where they come from been through what he been through this lol
He needs better people in his camp. Hopefully, there is someone close to him that can have that reality talk with him before he loses everything.
Much respect RJ real talk.
If he didnt mention black household..would be epic thing..dont be racist nigga
Wanna be NBA so baaaad🤦🏽‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
New video of my reaction! Ja Morant needs new friends!
RJ is so corny. We don't need to get your kids thoughts to know Ja is dumb.
R/wokekids
RJ's entire rant was a sneak diss at Ja Morant's fame seeking father, hilarious.
All I can think of is Dave chappelle’s “when keeping it real goes wrong”
If u don't mess with guns u not a real brotha.
ja setting a bad example for millions of kids world wide ESPECIALLY kids from inner cities communities. the nba need to set an example if not niggas going to push the envelope
He was about to say no weed 😂
Ja : what you saw in that video it wasn’t me and that’s on nba young boy  RJ: CAPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Richard jefferson stop it lol
He fine with C Block.
Let buddy be a thug bye ja
I don't see the problem with a man having a gun. It's not like he's running around in public with a pistol, he should be allowed to own and hold a gun in private, lol.
I don't care about the playing with the gun. Its him acting like a fake gangster. Some real ones need to press him and show him shit ain't a game
Some people don’t deserve to be rich. Smh. Give me that money, I’ll show you what to do with it.
Oh come on Jalen! You CODDLED HIM, SOFT BALL questioned him, HANDLED him like a small child, ensured you protected him, like a Juve Court judge, handling a child witness behind closed doors (in camera), and you say you're surprised now?
Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life. Proverbs 4:23 NLT
Morant will play gangster until either he ends up in prison or he ends up getting hurt. It's the life he wants to live and nobody can tell him otherwise.
But in what context did his 6 and 8 year old know that the gun was "bad". Sounds like RJ ain't too fond of guns, "we know those rules in black households, we don't play with any type of guns"
Iam surprised malika didnt find out a time JA was in trouble with the law when he was in high school and report it live. We know how she get when black men are in trouble. 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Everyone that’s saying he’s dumb for having a gun sounds crazy his only mistake was putting on social media but people don’t understand Ja living in Memphis it’s really crazy out here no one safe just look up Memphis crime rate and  car thefts it bet you’ll understand why then
10 yrs from now Richard Jefferson sons are going to get in trouble for carrying a gun
Nba youngboy is morant roll model
Richard Jefferson is a example of continuous growing ! i got mad love for RJ ! I followed his career and he only keeps going up and up !
Y did whiipeepel do dis?
I think Ja is mentally challenged honestly
Tee gotta be ashamed as a father
Ban Jack Ass from the league for a year
Ja needs to cut people off and stop listening to gangsta rap...Mem needs to get Ja on 24hr security to make sure this happens. Ja's crew simply dont have his best interest in mind...
the calmest cap I ever seen haha
There's something inside of Ja that's eating him alive. He's trying to destroy himself.
This idiot is going to end up in a ditch. But I guess that’s what he wants.
Can’t stand this guy.
Can believe that Jalen Rose sat there with a straight face and said what he said this time when it was him defending a grown 23-year old man by calling him a "kid" and that "it's not who he is" just two months ago when Ja Morant flashed a gun!!!  Ja did it again, because you enabled him Jalen Rose!
Malika knows best right boys ?
Wow from the mouth of babes! Simply said.
Cheerleading it as an artist is also pathetic remove this behavior from the culture and all platforms for good. We’re doing nothing but influencing the youth in horrible ways. It’s pathetic .
Every black person that you see on that pedal only dates white people
Leave the lingo/slang to the young kids , please RJ and Jalen don’t say it anymore or in the future
I’d bet my actual life like you get to choose how I die if I’m wrong that this conversation with his kids absolutely didn’t happen
Im a 2A advocate this man Ja is dumb
RJ- “ CAP 🧢 “ 😂
2nd amendement right. like what did he do
RJ’s face in the thumbnail is saying, “Come on, Ja!”😭💀
Memphis need to just move on, it was a cool experiment at the time just rebuild from the draft and draft another guard and build around Bane
smh sellouts never surprise
Cap=Bullshit!
He needs to be suspended for a whole season
Rj really said “cap” media is wild😂😂
We gonna act like a 6 year ask them questions? RJ really on that Smollet with this story lol😂
“The worst thing in the world is wasted talent!” - From the movie “ A Bronx Tale”
CAP
RJ is so full of shit. You really did that with your kids. Your fucked in the head
Definitely "CAP" Rich... 😀
Bro said 🧢, RJ having none of it😂
HE WANTS BE A THUG. KICK HIM OUT OF THE LEAGUE. THROWING AWAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE A GANG STAR AND A THUG IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THIS CLOWN THAN BEHAVING AND MAKING A BILLION DOLARS.
If they trash they might get a good draft pick
After some negative comments, doesn't the Second Amendment serves as the legal basis for the "right of the people to keep and bear arms."  He's in the legal age and possibly have a permit.  So why can't a black man carry a gun while Kyle Rittenhouse, Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Green, and those MAGA minions showing off their AR-15?
After the interview, after 2nd time and rehab this penalty needs to be extremely harsh.... I'm giving him a year. Also must serve a considerably amount of community service, PSAs, counseling and contract things that limit him on social media with 3rd infraction of being banned by league
Suspend him for the entire season, and have all sponsors drop him. That's the only thing that will get through to him.
No comment on this channel about black men.
Ja Morant is the inverse of 50 Cent he isnt trying to Get Rich Or Die Tryin he is Getting Poor And Die Trying
rich💵 be tryna be on KAMMA ruhh tryna look bald n PRETTI
Jalen Rose always babying this man
Sounding very anti-2nd amendment. But I agree he's stupid for playing with it.
The difference is RJ is a good father. Ja has a thug for a father, kids imitate what they see.
I can't defend this man anymore
RJ , well said!
This let's us all know that the 2 weeks of therapy he spent in Florida was a waist of everyone's time
Why would Richard Jefferson say that kids are not allowed to play with any type of guns in black households, including toy guns. First of all, that's not true and secondly what does being black have to do with this topic?
"I don't let my guns play with my kids... err.. I mean... I don't let my kids play with guns" 😂😂😂
He is suspended of what
Ja give your knees to d rose please lmao
Ja making the nba looking foolish lol
Yeah Nigga that’s you
I think the nba should change their rules on guns. Keep them away from the nba facilities but express gun safety and turn this into a positive rather than tearing him down
WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.. IT COULD BE PROPAGANDA, TO MAKE THE BLACK CULTURE LOOKING MORE DISGUSTING THEN WHAT IT ALREADY IS. THE CRAZY PART IS THAT THE SAME PEOPLE SAYING JA MORANT SILLY FOR THIS , IS THE SAME PEOPLE SUPPORTING THE RAP MUSIC THATS GLORIFYING KILLING EACH OTHER OPPS ,GLOCKS AND BS. URL RAP BATTLES ECT. THE CULTURE IS THE REASON. JA MORANT IS JUST ANOTHER YOUNG BROTHER THATS A VICTIM TO A BOGUS CULTURE MOST SUPPORT DAILY.
We don't play with guns in black households.  Lol
Thug get no money.
This is a Democratic witch hunt. Democrats wants to take your guns away.
2nd ammendment. But Ja is too dumb to raise some deep questions about what type of African American the league wants.
Cancel Ja's contract and ban him for life.  He is a thug and it's clear he will one day go too far and likely shoot someone.  Get him out of the league.
BLACKS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH
Van is literally raising his kids to be afraid of guns. They should not be afraid of guns, but rather they should respect guns, and know how to use one if necessary. Kids will want to experiment with the “forbidden” if you parent like that.
Richard Jefferson’s break down to his children says it all… This dimwit should be suspended for at least 6 months
Man, Jalen and Shannon Sharpe have been there for Ja in ways that his actual father hasn’t been both in person and through the media. Ja’s dad is just as immature as he is and he keeps encouraging it because he is enjoying the benefit of all the accolades and money his son is earning. This is not only on Ja, but is on his family, friends, the organization, and his teammates for not reality checking him. Who has no one responsible who is guiding him. Ja grew up with a nice family and parents who loved and supported him, but he is trying to act hard like he wasn’t. He needs to get better support around him, otherwise we may be watching the beginning of another A.B. Immensely talented and gifted, but will blame everything else around him for problems he started.🤦🏽‍♂️
I think Ja needs to grow up, he ain’t a thug stop trying to be one be grateful you got an opportunity to play in the NBA which I guarantee a lot of other people would want. I hope Nike cuts ties with him cause he doesn’t deserve it
Dude going to loose all the money he worked hard for ! Then he will get traded and forgotten about
needs to lose the rest of his sponsors to start . then get suspended  for a year without pay and the league  chooses  what rehab facility  he goes to for a year no questions  asked.
Jalen really a simp
Many kids came in at 18 and have not acted like this. So ja age is no excuse.
After the first suspension, Jalen gave Ja Morant free rehabilitation in what was one of the worst "sit-down" interviews I've ever watched. Where Ja said he got reiki treatment to address his mental health issues following (checks notes) brandishing a gun at a night club. I'd like to hear Jalen reflect on the success of his hall pass.  And while we're on that, not long after it came out that Ja was getting sued for punching a kid at a pickup game ~12 months ago Malika had a 1 on 1 with Ja and if she did ask him about it it didn't make the interview. For 12 months ESPN looked the other way at every possible opportunity as one of the NBA's biggest rising stars messed around off the court. Now these anchors are putting on concerned faces like they were blindsided.
Somebody tell Jalen that his died 100.00 cut looks horrible.
damn ja gotta cut his dreads off now and turn muslim 😂
Just because I can bounce a basketball ,doesn’t mean I should raise your kids ,, Charles Barkley
Right on RJ and Jalen. Appreciate the wisdom and perspective.
ja morant took all the spot light off ben simmons
Role model?!?!? Cmonnn man
im from a time where the phrase "dont pull it out unless your gonna use it" meant something..
RJ is the cream of the crop on ESPN. He's a bro.
Jalen looks so bad for all this.  This kid played him like a fiddle just to get back on the court.
Let's revisit this conversation when RJs kids are teens/young adults.  Kids do what you teach them when they're young.  They do what they want when they THINK they're grown.    Will make you go from "I'm so proud of you" to "who raised you."
As the saying goes, when someone shows you who they are believe them!
Count how many times ja say " u know" in an interview....what a bird
Much respect for Richard Jefferson but we ain't for u to use your kids ja already getting buried folks forget he was 🎧 to that NBA YB richest opp 😂 and quit blaming his pop
Ja’s going to end up in the next Kendrick Lamar “The Heart” video.
The NBA went from serving us a full course meal to TV dinners….. the younger these players get the more problems they are going to have to deal with. The NBA wants to be the HIPHOP of sports.
Crucify his Ass, No Mercy! He has gotten enough chances
The therapy didn’t work.
This needs to cost him BIG TIME, like half the season with no pay. Maybe that will knock some sense into him. The penalty has to be painful. At his level losing a few hundred thousand doesn't seem to do it.
🍿🍿🍿🍿
Ja the ghetto thug that ruined his career.  It’s not racist to call someone a thug because it’s not a color issue.  It’s a cultural issue.  Black people love to act ghetto and think it’s cool.  I don’t get it.
another "not scripted" interview with Jalen and Ja coming soon. . .😆
Ja is a dummy, terrible role model & bad father- he’s jeopardizing his entire future & setting a bad example for his child…
Great job Richard.
Yo i hate they bring shit their kid say , even when is true , cringy asf
Richard is a clown for this one 3:38 🤣🤣
RJ is the best analyst on ESPN
Why does Malika try to make her voice low. It doesn't even sound natural.
Ja you can have guns, you can have hobbies hell you can be a damn gun enthusiast. But bruh you're in the NBA a private organization that has its own rules. Stop doing stupid shit, especially on camera.
This niggas a sell out/house nigga😢🤡🧁◻️🍭
There is a section in the CBA between the NBA and NBA Players Association which says that players are not permitted to have guns/deadly weapons “whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player's Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity”.Mar 7, 2023
Ja the type of guy to point a gun to his head as he dances like an idiot. Let that sink in.
Totally made up story, but it’s a good one.
“Daddy” 😂 at 6 and 8? Lol
Rj u full of shit u ain’t say that to ur kids
Bro you didn’t have that conversation with your kids shut up
Shut up Richard Jefferson. I like Ja Morant and I think he’s cool and gangsta and hip. Nothing cooler than guns in the “hood” for an NBA star
Richard Jefferson literally explained WHY this is not good for ja morant! Ja needs to hear this I’m 22 (1 year younger than ja) and I know that was a terrible mistake by ja! Now little kids saying that!? It’s sad ja you gotta be better bruh..
" I don't let my guns play with any kind of kid" also works for me^^
So a 6 year old smarter
Your kids what
Y’all so fake on here. Your childrens said nothing!!! You sitting up here lying though your teeth
Imagine how many dumb things he has done that has not hit social media out there. He clearly has a problem and likes the company of similar minded folks. His attempts to clarify things and seek “counseling” are a joke.  The league is being too lenient and will only encourage more of the same from others.  Imagine how much worse things will get in a league already full of grown men acting, talking and dressing like teenagers
This why I like RJ
Ja Morant a prospect that wasn’t heavily recruited worked his ass off stayed two years in college to be seen. Dominated his rookie season in which he could’ve easily been the 1st overall pick, won most improved player, signed with Nike gets a signature shoe deal very lucrative, got a max contract for 200m, Becoming a face of the NBA. My question is why? Why must young black men have the need to look how the world already sees us dangerous, dumb, & not humble. C’mon Ja you have so many people rooting for you to keep making senseless decisions the league already let you slide once bc nobody believes that you weren’t sober or that the gun in the first altercation was fake but they forgave you and you go right back and do the same shit knowing your under a microscope do better man the world is watching you kids are looking up to you man!
WANNA BE GANGSTA THAN A BALLA
All that money! And the man wanna be a GANGSTER! 🤣🤡 Please! Give me all his money! 😎 ✌🏾
Hey Richard, I’ll take stories that never happened for $600
It takes more than counseling to change a lifetime of street life without any values….the NBA doesn’t need JA!  There’s other talented upcoming youths who want to become an elite member of the NBA… your out JA!
Can't believe you got sold with that Ja interview
Ja just gave Malika Andews all the ammo she needed to further punish black men on TV. Thanks a lot Ja.
That 8 game suspension was a joke. Do better Adam Silver
freudian slip by RJ saying "i dont let my guns play..." lol but shoutout to these ex players spittinf wisdom. Yes Ja has a right to guns but my main issue with him is flexing with it online...its a mental issue he may have smh
Anything less than a 50-game suspension is BS
He’s just doing what all these rappers make millions off of. What’s the problem? Haha!
Ja is an attention seeker. First person to make it out the Nba and into the hood
Ja morant is clearly an imbecile
Jalen rose is bought and paid for as well the other media members. Make no mistake about it.
So stupid. Dont show videos of cars then. Theyre very very dangerous too
I was gone be mad at ja but i was in and out of prison at his age 🤷🏾‍♂️ but if i was a multi millionaire last thing im doing is worried about a gun  i had to keep it on me 🤦🏾‍♂️ he need to be banned from listening to yb if anything
What message????
Oh my. Dont show your legal gun on social media. Blah blah blah. Black households. Lmfao. Bye Felicia.
My momma used to say  “A Hard Head Make A Soft Ass” Enough said
The thing is he has his Dad and Mom with him
1:34 that’s a general statement. I’m black and had toy guns growing up and still plink when I get the chance. All black ppl and fams aren’t the same, Cali man.
Kids know right and wrong most of the time, ja really just looking so damn stupid
I'm happy that RJ's kids are more adult then Ja Morant!
I don't see anything changing with his attitude, my opinion! Maybe he can be that gangster he's always wanted to be.
This makes Dillon Brooks look like an angel 😇, at least he just pokes bears 🐻 🐻‍❄ 🤣🤣🤣🤣; Ja Morant wants all the smoke with a gun. Now the Memphis Grizzlies said under no circumstances is Dillon returning to the team, now let's see how hypocrite the organization is after doing it not once but twice; now if gun is Ja cup of tea let it be, but sooner or later Ja is going to run into someone that has a gun and wants all that smoke for real and wind up dead somewhere 🤔, 👍❤️. Pura Vida
When people show you who they are believe them..💯
RJ don’t know he’s raising another man’s kids 😂
I dont think anybody bought Ja on his words and his supposed contrition from his first stint with rehab. It was PR. He clearly needs a severe punishment to learn his lesson because he lacks the maturity and company to help get through these issues. Hopefully, he learns at some point.
You show ja at the strip club with the ratchet ghetto “women” light skin Richard 😂
Some People really acting like he didn't do anything wrong, Even though it isnt against the law in Tennessee NBA has its own rules that you need to follow as an employee he going to find out real quick NBA not with people damaging their brand especially 2x
Ja played all his supporters and ppl who defended him during the first time. I felt by his issue with the Pacers bus and the teenager claiming to be assaulted at his house- we couldnt let him off the hook so easily. But everyone did so now he felt like he can do whatever he wants without real punishment. Hopefully the league wont let it slide and all his supporters can realize that he dont gaf about his life/career rn, why should yall?
Kid needs a year off NO PAY! To think about whether or not his actions are the actions of a professional! He needs someone to give him a talk about his friends! Maybe these guys aren’t the type of people he should be hanging out with! Obviously they don’t give a shit about him!
Cap story
Even for a rapper doing this type of stuff and flashing guns usually ends up with someone being killed. Glad I don't listen to that crappy music anymore.
the lies are in this man's face.. stop lying about what you told your children SAMBO ... sucking up to these CAVE-CASIANS
Malika is a fine piece of chocolate 😍
Let it be a white player he'd be out the league 💯
richard jefferson is overrated
Even Papa Dot was smarter than this 😂
Lol all this because he had a gun grow up
Whatever he’s dealing with, I hope he truly gets help and not some PR stunt to get back to playing basketball
These people have zero clue about guns.  Are players aloud to go to a gun range and take pictures?
If JA don’t start a YouTube channel shooting guns like Black Rambo or just go the fucking Gun-range in your free time 🤦‍♂️
Cap….. 🧢
Richard made up a whole story😂😂😂
Some young melinated brothers can't handle the Fame and Fortune. He is responsible for a lot of people, at 23 that's a lot of pressure..I'm sure his dad had a conversation with him already, but his dad can't babysit him anymore
Am I the only one who doesn’t see the severity of the situation?😂😂😂
Thing is most kids do “that dance” cuz they know of this dude
These dudes lame af....
RJs example of his kids knowing Ja morant and knowing what it would implicate if those kids have no parental guidance is the realest it can get. It might be a minor thing to some but definitely it will have an effect because Ja is a public figure now.
Your pops shows up to all the games but not have the critical talks?!?
Dillon Brooks looking mighty good right now 😅😅
Not surprised by this post
Jefferson I call cap
Some folks need to get  business together .. get real .. and wake up .. like come on it’s 2023 .. y’all still doing each other in ? You know how many kids are gonna see this? You know how many lives will be lost cuz Ja Morant gassed their young minds up .. and who y’all gonna blame? Hell nah look in the mirror
Man, his 6 year old didn't say all that bs, gaslighting.. but Ja is wrong for what he is doing.
Come to the Knicks we don’t give a f#%*
They could of just played the "Thanks for watching ESPN on YouTube" immediately after RJ said  🧢 💪😂
I think people aren't wrong in their assessment of Ja. However, what they are missing is its not about being tough or being gangsta. It's just what these kids (teens- mid 20's) do today. They don't dance or anything like we used to do. They see a video of a popular guy rapping moving menacing back and forth with a pistol, guys pointing guns and bopping with them to the beat and it's just a look. It was originated from a place of intimidation but it's just a look now and it's always been there. In 94 if you took a pic of me and my boys i could bet we were mean muggin, someone was crouched down holding, someone was flexing muscles, a girl, cash or jewelry, someone was acting like they was on the phone trappin, someone was pointing gun fingers or whatever. We was wearing Polo, Avirex leathers, Iceberg sweaters, throwback jerseys, fatigues, timberlands, Jordans, whatever was popular. Listening to street tales from JayZ, WuTang, Spice 1, Too Short to 8ball and MJG etc. Many of us grew up out of that to work good jobs, be fathers, own businesses, go to college, played sports in college and professionally, coach teams, work in law enforcement, schools, doctors, etc. Some went to jail, some sold drugs, got hooked on drugs, some died. All we say now is man we was wild back then. Remember so and so? Yea he got shot or went to jail or he's a real estate agent or computer programmer. If I take a pic of my son and his friends they got someone muggin, someone in a shiesty mask, someone showing their grill, someone holding money, someone holding a gun, someone dressed fly, some wearing designer, someone wearing jewelry etc. What I'm saying is from the outside with age and maturity you see it's not a good look but it's what a lot of guys do from 14-28. Lol. It's cyclical. Does it mean they are all thugs, no. Does it mean their lives are destin for doom, no. We are equating his on court performance with his actual maturity level and where he his mentally. What needs to be addressed is the fact that is a unfortunate right of passage for some black males. Even Shaq kicked it with Mansfield gangsta ♿. I seen Iverson throwing money with BMF. Ray Lewis people killed a man. No one except the few who are brought up differently or thought differently are exempt. Many just don't get caught up. Now it's on social media for the world to see. Unfortunately, during the ages of young adulthood  to manhood being or looking tough is a thing in the black community or any community for that matter. Is Ja fuckin up because he has too much on the line, yes. Is it dumb, yes. However, to him it's not that serious because of the climate of today.
Even in music it’s lame. Chill with the gun violence. It doesn’t make you cool. It makes you look like a clown. Does not make you tough in anyway. You really weak AF
W dad RJ man
Ja Done!
Ja warrant 🤭 hehe
All Season gone
It’s a pattern he’s created in a negative narrative, Therefore he has no one but himself to blame but himself for putting himself in that magnified spotlight!💯
Ja doing dumb stuff. Richard Jefferson sounds like he CAPPING though 😂😂😂
everybody has guns stop crying because a athlete has it
Even the la says you can’t brandish or pull it, just to be pulling it or showing it. It prohibits it
Jalen need to stop making excused for Ja. Just like he need to dial down on the bigen on NBA countdown.
RJ got me when he said CAP 😂
What is your reaction of Dana white slapping his wife?
The Jalen Rose interview got Ja looking soooo crazy right now. It was no dots connected just bare bullshit being spoken lol smh
What league needs to do is like what David Stern did and told to Carmelo: “I know who you with… where you live at; I know where they live at. I know when you close your eyes, I know when you wake up,” "You want to play ball or be in the streets?". It's in or out of the league ultimatum
Stop lying RJ 😂😂
Ja Morant new name is NBA Dumbboy…….😂
Ja needs a RJ in his life.  Someone with nothing to lose who will call him out for his BS.
Cap 😂😂😂
Let Ja go.  He's a great athlete, but that's all.  Nobody has been killed or hurt.  He'd rather ride around with a gun, or go to a club with a gun.  So?  He's a grown man, playing a sport for money.  He can choose his friends, and his lifestyle.  Suspend him if you're the League, let the Grizzlies terminate him...whatever.  People choose.  He's chosen. There are tons of NBA role models that would like to have a shoe deal, or the endorsements, or a starting role on a team.  What are they always saying "Next man up...".
Much respect to RJ for this
Guns arent toys. I really just dont understand. Personally, i dont have a problem with people owning guns but they need to be locked in a safe unless you are going to a range to practice or to protect yourself and property.
Leave Temetrious alone he has a licence lol
I’m going to keep it real with you Rose, your hair color looks terrible and it’s really annoying. please let your true color grow cuz it does not make you look younger bro 👎!!!!!!
So that whole interview with Jalen Rose was just a complete waste of time and money 🤦🏽🤣
Richard Jefferson is aggravating 😂😂😂💯💯💯💯
rj gained my respect. seems like a good teacher and father
Imagine if draymond did this 😂😂😂
Ja was giggling and everything during that interview with Jalen Rose. And we’re surprised now? 🤷  I hope Steven Adams gets out of there. Seems like too cool of a dude to be stuck on a team like this
jeff really  said "cap" lmaoooo
I’m tired of listening to this bitch.
In other words…people are surprised “ja” is drawn to black cultural norms…✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿…blm is black cultural’s only role model…check the crime stats across the board….hahahahaha o man…
🧢 comment lmfao
Question to Malika So where was your take on this topic? No enough cancel culture or...?
Lol!  Ja Morant a straight street Niggah!  A straight GOON!  Love it 😆😆😆
i rolled my eyes the whole time he was talking, no ones gives af about your god damn kids 😂😂😂😂😂
I don't get it...aren't guns legal in America? Isn't it in your constitution? Why is it only a problem when a black man has a gun?
It was obvious in the Jalen Rose interview that it was BS lol.   I remember telling my friend that. Ja was full of shit in that interview but I hope the kid gets his head straight
I feel like Ja played Jalen Rose for a chump, who was trying to do him a favor and get him back on track.  Epic bag fumble.  And lost a ton of respect everywhere.
