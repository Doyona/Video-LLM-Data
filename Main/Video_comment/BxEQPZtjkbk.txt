Is the McPlant not vegan!?!? You definitely should have tried that from McDonald’s!!
I love pickles
haha, good luck eating vegetables for a WHOLE day. how did you survive this ordeal?!
Try Indian vegan food
If you can't be fully vegan try to reduce your meat consumption or be 50 - 60% vegan  OR be vegan for 3 days a week , it will definitely reduce the misery of some animals
Vegans you’ve gotta give up cheese had me rolling
I once tried a vegan burger even though I eat meat and it was surprisingly good. It was beat root based.
Imagine being vegan or vegetarian grow up plonkers bet you all have a rainbow in your banners too 🤣😂
At your big age taking the pickle out of burgers?
Go Vegan to save animals! As Long you don't care about rat, mice, rabbit etc.
If u wanna be vegan ..... U gotta go Indian dude. Cause Indian vegan shit is 🔥🔥
Where's the mcplant!!
I'm vegan and I had the same reaction to purezza lmfao
Next trying vegan food from tesco etc
Can we just point out, lettuce doesn’t grow on trees…. 🤔😂🌳
Quorn is the best fake meat brand ever
I love pickles in burgers !
As a vegan the veggie dippers are trash...
I'm veggie on the verge on vegan and the one thing i can't find a replacement for is butter and cheese! i was also expecting you to cook vegan meals aswell maybe next time
Surprised this aint on ur main
Sound editing is terrible on this. Volume is all over the place.
The editing tho 👌
I feel like cal has the face/build to where he could do modeling.
Is vegan food really as environmentally friendly as they claim?
if only hed done this after the mcplant came out
Ngl I was expecting Cal to pull out the Mcplant
Nutritional Yeast is like a nutty cheesy powder that contains B12 and it's really popular within the vegan community
love the vid
Amazing video as usual Cal, keep up the fantastic content , your videos always make my day !!!
The pizza looked fucking awful 😂
Editing = next level
A vegan eating meat for 24 hours would be interesting
Actually love what u did in this video I’m not vegan but my sister has been for most of her life so I understand why she’s vegan
Try being a vegetarian for. 24 hours
Dudes music is always on point
i rate the effort that uve tried it, but cooking vegan food actually gives u so much more oportunities than just going out for food
You should do a part 2 with bk royale, kfc burger, mcplant, dominos and other suggestions from comments 🍔🌱
Should have tried the McPlant. Apparently there’s BARELY any difference between the real burger and the McPlant.
they are not saving shit
I love a pickle
What’s the song
Song??
what is that outro song called
Definitely should try the burger kings vegan royale, plant based whopper and vegan nuggets! Also depending on when this was made there’s just as many options now to buy food plant based! M&S have a huge and great selection as well as other supermarkets and some brands like Richmond, quorn, birds eye have amazing choices! Tastes amazing and no animals have to suffer
“Prey for me” prey for the animals who die every day
Bruv the audio is shite
Why did we not try the McPlant at Maccies though 🤯
The audio on this video was a stinker
Why is this on the clips channel
Wow food
Stop being childish and eat the pickles
WHY IS THIS ON THIS CHANNEL
if you don't mind me asking what music track is that at 3:25 ?
Everyone should be vegan, don't choose your taste buds over a sentient being losing its life and suffering.And vegan food is so good aswell
I love pickle
why would this not be a main channel vid ?
Why isn’t this main channel? Excuse me?
Need to do again with greg, subway, burger king, kfc…. And mcplant
As I’m watching this it’s 12pm and I’m eating a jar of gherkins in bed with cal saying eww to gherkins …
No one goes on about the wrap. they go on about the mcplant.
You should try Kojo
Good video! But cal if you’re gonna be true to the title, you need to be a arsehole that doesn’t know facts. Claims to be saving the planet when it’s the opposite and lastly tell everyone that they’re vegan in every sentence.
I probably unintentially eat vegan some days without realising
Next time try all the new vegan fast food options!!! There’s options for vegan burgers at Burger King dude 😳
I love pickles
you shouldve tried the mcplant and vegan nuggets at Burger King cos they be hitting differently 😈
The McDonald’s veggie dippers are nasty but the veggie burgers from McDonald’s and Burger King are unreal
Cal you should learn jiu Jitsu, great body for it
Where is your nokia shirt from mate?
you should try vurgerco!!!!
Vegan is not limited people always assume it’s just lettuce but look up meals.. I do agree that it’s limited eating out especially if you don’t live in a city with a lot of food places
Burger King vegan nuggets are elite there so good
When did you film this, no way was this recently mans out in a T-shirt in winter,
Here comes the hate comments from vegans after he said he wants to feel the blood of the cows running through his teeth 🤣🤣
The thumbnail is cancerous
Disappointing video. There’s so many vegan options, especially in London. You’re comparing it to animal products rather than just tasting it as actual food. You mostly went to vegan only places, there’s vegan options in 99% of restaurants, so plenty to choose from.
Stealing intro music off Conor parsons is freezy now😮‍💨
But tomatoes are shit
Eazy i can be veagan for 1 month or 2
Watching this while waiting for my nandos order
Surprisingly a lot of people get the veggie dippers from McDonald’s. I personally don’t like them tho
I love how he was scared of the vegan milkshake yet the only difference is they would use plant based milk 😅
Oh the second vegan spot is near moorfields eye hospital
Should have gone to Indian resturants. There are so many options
Dude finally found sometime that folds their pizza like me I thought I was the only one all the topping cheese and sauce stays in if you fold it like a taco!!
If someone is a vegan and also does cross fit which one do they mention first in conversation
Just saying... pickles make a burger.
The way he takes the wrap out haha. Does he know there’s a tab half way down the packaging u pull around 😂
Why didn't you get the mcplant?
Plant guy at 3:30 has gone out and bought some of them rare plants that go for thousands that lidl and a few other stores sold by accident it was everywhere it was
Try living with coeliac disease, can’t eat anywhere n it’s a health problem, but these vegans n vegetarians get way more options n it’s a diet choice
look at this lol this guy wahaahaaa bruv ffs
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate how good the quality of the vid was😮‍💨
Dude it's so easy being a vegetarian or vegan these days. It's was different 10-15 years ago when if you told someone you was vegetarian they thought you was crazy and was starved.
Why not try being underwater for 24 hours?
I never got why a vegan would want to eat a "Vegan Burger". It's made to resemble beef and they try to make it look/taste just like a beef burger. It baffles me!
Honest burgers actually slap 🔥
Loved the editing
Pickles take a burger or a sarnie to the next level
On behalf of 🐄 🐖 🐓 🦆 Thankyou for trying out all the Vegan options 🙏
sick edit
As a vegan for 5 years, I can confirm that vegan cheese just isn't it.
2:37 if it’s a vegan burger place than why did they give mayonnaise
As if you didn't get the mcplant from mcdonalds!
Any vegan chicken stuff is where it’s at😍
UPLOAD ON YOUR MAIN CHANNELLLLLLLLLLLLL
Banging video tbf. The pacing wad on point👌
Vegan pizza is a disgrace to humanity
It has to be England people not liking pickles. I get jars of them just to eat them.
should try a video for people who are lactose intolerant. Finding stuff to eat can be very difficult
real ones know the intro song from joshua weissman
Who will make “vegan tries to eat meat for 24 hours”
Honest burger is so elite anyway tbf
Calfreezy: lets try vegan FOOD  Also freezy: *Tries only vegan burgers*
Pickles are the best topping in burger
U need to try Indian vegan food!!
Isn't this a main channel vid
Great that you tried stuff and liked some of the options but think you missed the mark a bit bro, being vegan doesn't mean you wanna eat vegetables only, who the fuck has aubergine pizza or veggie dippers from maccies, pick better choices next time please 😂😂 you need a meat feast pizza, a mcplant or a dirty kebab from what the pitta 👀👀
Main channel potential
Vegan food Peng
5:07, you can tell cal has been hanging out with jaackmaate
all the vegans are so excited lol
It’s sad cause vegans can really eat McDonald’s at least in Canada cause thing are made in the same fryers
im not one to hate but the only reason why some vegan burgers taste as good as normal burgers is because of the amount of times the pattys been processed with junk
The sound track in this video is about as interesting as callux's forehead
Finally you decided to upload again 😤😤😤
I need a vegetarian one
Why be a vegan? Most of the Indians are vegetarians not vegans so they enjoy real milk and other milk products like cheese etc.
try the vegan kfc burger its so much better then the mcdonalds wrap
Why don’t I get notifications from this channel?
Uploaded to wrong channel?
I’m anaphylactic to dairy witch means I can die if I have a tiny bit of any dairy protein or anything with milk in it a So I have to eat vegan foods and because I don’t live in a city I live in the country there’s no vegan restaurants near me there all at least w hrs away in Melbourne Australia so yeah lol
Pickles belong in burgers
How is this not main channel video it was a really good video
Vegans 🤝 Muslims (not being able to eat anything and having very limited options)
anyone know what t shirt he was wearing
can you do this but gluten free pleaseee
Bro imagine living in London and saying the vegan options are limited 😂
Cant speak to other cultures but hundreds of sri lankan and Indian  tamil dishes are vegan naturally as they use coconut milk if milk is needed. Its cheap to make and delicious. Vegan restaurants are just a rip off and fake meat generally just tastes horrible.
Bro walking through London is shorts when it’s mid winter
Why is the editing better then the mai  channel
U should try this for a week
What’s the name of the intro song ???
Can you do a video trying Quorn please! I’m a vegetarian and I honestly think Quorn is well better than meat ❤️
Vegan doesn’t mean healthy so it can still taste nice.
Just thought this would be an interesting lil fact (not trying to convince you to be vegan cos I'm not and that'd be mad hypocritical) but in the one day you were vegan you saved: 30 sq ft of forest, 20 lbs of CO2 from being released, 1100 gallons of water and the life of one animal (sorry for the old school measurements it's just was the website I read used- might not be completely accurate).
I've been vegi for like 5 years now and I fully agree with the pizza thing, literally the only reason I'm not vegan, the cheese just doesn't melt right
i just can't take advice from a man who doesn't like pickles
Not sure this was meant to be for the clips channe
BAHAH the random “calfreezy”
🔥
How no one asking why Cal is wearing shorts n a tee in winter ? 🤣 when was this film Mr callum 🧐🧐 finally decided to upload?
that editing at the start was fucking cold hahah
Cal's fit is crazyyyyyyyy😭
Uploaded to wrong channel?
Why tf did the volume increase so much when he was eating the McDonald’s 🤣
more jubilee vids bro
transitions were elite big ups
VeganG 4 life
Cal that intro slapped
You need to take a vegan with you for direction
We got our Gordon Ramsay here for the sidemen videos
That beginning edit was sick
I miss these videos 😍😍😍
Surprising you haven't tried the mcplant at the end haha.  I find it interesting how vegan stuff tends to be mediocre most of the time... or better that the normal animal products.
Vegan options aren’t actually quite as limited as you might think
Eat halal and get gib in the vid
Nuutela?
should've been a main channel video 😔
credit to DiyaCake- TRY INDIAN FOOD!!! - pani puri, vada pav, jalebi, khaman, bhajia, kure kure, gulab jamun, dosaaaaaa, chicken biryani and many more :D
ah cal! there’s so many nice vegan places that you missed, especially in camden! also shocked that you didn’t get the vegan burger from mcdonald’s😳
I feel like he uploaded this to the wrong channel
2:29 tell me thats not the first hole from sidemen pubgolf.
Yo just go grab that vegan sausage roll you and Simon had

Do one with south Asian food.
Me who doesn't eat for days at a time: ha, wimp
This is such a cheap vid to make aha
people who bitch about pickles YIKES. The biggest fast food chain in the world includes them for a reason.
People don't realise that Majority of Indian food is vegan lol
love a pickle.
I love a pickle
For real u guys need to go to Indian restaurants for vegan food you’ll love it, everything fails in front of Indian vegan food

Deffo got scammed on that pizza, never seen such a poor effort. 80% is weird but there are some bangers
Also you are the funniest.
You are the best cal :)  I love love love you and your videos. ❤
I can't lie vegan food is atrocious
"In for 24 hours" love it
I love a pickle
Cal is the type of guy who wouldn’t beat his meat cause he’s a vegan
Hi
