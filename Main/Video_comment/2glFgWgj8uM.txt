THe Little THings and still they reveal hurtful news to families on channels where it's live for everyone to see.
Probably all dopers
Keep the border free and open Biden. “Undocumented” felons, I mean immigrants, love coming up here to pillage the country. California is the shining star of great government leadership.  You get what you vote for…
it's interesting how 'long island' new yorkers make a huge ordeal over a few bodies found murdered on a beach  yet obviously they don't realize many many many unidentified bodies around found in the western desert between Arizona to Nevada  to southern California deserts for years - like Lake Mead for example !!!   much more unidentified or identified murders and unsolved cases for several years now in this region of desert land including the outskirts of Las Vegas and all those unsolved cases  😐🤔😢
I’m curious how the lady knew they were out there. Things that make you go hmm 🤔
Only the Moon knows, where the dead are
Were these Law Abiding US citizens minding their business out for a coke and a smoke ? If not, it is what it is in that high stakes game they play.
Nice shoes Dude MY NIKE BLAZERS =)  QUIEREN MIS ZAPATOS PERO NO LES QUEDAn
The Haitian police in Houston might need more information on who needs them.
Good job Biden keeping these borders open I’m sure this will be seen a lot more now
Illegal immigrants
😢😢😢🙏❤️🙏
It's going to be heartbreaking
democrats
If this is ginger Miller stock or related to her their insects trafficking racketeering and kidnapping child abuse and they will manipulate it and divert it to the parents. They will blackmail and extortion or girlfriends that are not biologically related to a child. They will make foals reports about you everywhere you go so if that's a part of that family it's a drug family and they force their way in everybody's home there's been this lady at my door banging consistently calling me texting and reported several times. On God in the name of Jesus Christ name 🙏
COME ON MAN there are loads of people buried in this countries desert   its hard to find a spot that has no bones  such is life along these deserts
Deberian de pone mas bijilancia
Mark my words this will continue to happen as long as the cartels control our southern border.
Since it was six people I suspect a love hexagon gone wrong.
Cosigned by joe
Illegals?
Are you joking with the MURDERS IN MASS AMOUNTS? THESE AREVTHE END DAYS!!!
democrat drug cartels
Who call police 👮‍♀️ or sheriff department to notify themes HOW he or she find out ???? In that area !!???
Got to love them illegal aliens
There are mobile morgues along the border. Those who can be identified are sent back to their families. Those who aren't are buried at taxpayer expense.
BREAKING BAD LIVE-------REPORT THE TRUTH - WELCOME TO BIDEN'S WORLD OF CRIME AND DRUGS
All that have to do is check the US National spy satellites to find out who did it.
Think we've all seen Breaking Bad at this point.  Glad to see the news just cashing checks instead of setting up a fund for the families.
Facebook market place gone wrong
Comifornia, murder no doubt about it.
I live in El mirage have almost my whole life this is scary
Having Newsom is laughing at the fools that voted for him.
MS 13?
Drugs
It was an ambush.  The victims fire back an hit one of the rivels in the shoulder he having when the hospital but he is gonna have to go keep an eye on that
Those found sure seems to have enjoyed that open border!!!  Isn't that Mexican culture beautiful???  It's a good thing Commiefornia has disarmed so many law abiding citizens!!!
Thanks Joe Biden
No Country For Old Men
Omgshhh soo strange..😞😞like a scary movie. Soo sad🙏🏽
I'm not saying it was the Aliens but....
Enough is enough Close the border Build the wall
Cause of death? Most likely allergic to bullets
Breaking Bad.
Breaking bad reference?
drugs related crime thats it cartel stile
Greetings ☕🫖 good morning 🌞🙏🏻 this is worse than my cell phone service and identity theft issues.....Check their credit reports🤺 Detective Trujillo from Phoenix Arizona should be investigated since he knew Ben and Della were not my biological parents there was no legal adoption for me
How they got there? In the car 🤪🙄 Biden supporters killing their own.
The seller and the buyer got rob
gov. Newson👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
One of them might be who tried to bribe Kerry lake
We're fighting foreign wars instead of fighting cartels at our own borders
Cartel! As much as people don't want to believe it, there is a huge presence of the Mexican cartels in the United States and in every Big City. A SUV and a minivan. Maybe what happened was these people were bringing the drugs and the American dealer decided to Rob them because he didn't have the money. Or the opposite. He had drugs and they have the money, but he didn't have all of it. And I do not think it was just one guy.  At least three.
Its all the deep state’s fault , it has so much blood they have so much blood on their hands all the while it continues to distract and accuse President Trump because they fear he will clean the globalist swamp mafia
That was an ambush…. Look how the roads cross …. Someone was waiting for them…. Someone ran off on the plug
I don't like how Christian said, " the family left without getting any information." The police said that they need to gather evidence first.
Ambush..😮😢😮
LA county desert is cartel land. So is Kern and San Bern and Riverside.  Lots of stories of people traveling on smaller roads and coming across well armed men telling them to turn around. People get their water stolen and are warned not to report it. State of CA refuses to do anything about it. Local leaders won't speak out either.
sooo... how close is this place to the "moon landing" filming site?
Good God.. what's happening in the USA.. so many murders. Worse than my country! From South Africa.
Are these 6 casualties-  escapees from that Jacumba (where's that) mountainous desert??
Illegal migrants?
Drug Reps and Salesman
just people being people......... right?!?          :(
How does one join the cartel
Biden's America.
Np country for old men 🤪
Importing the third world is working out great..
One word cartel
Yikes
special forces to tell you guys right now from the above helicopter looks like this people got ambush license plates from Oregon in California. Yeah OK guys why is the news not telling the truth the man or drug cartels are going out there in the desert person of course they identify because then I’m gonna tell her the cartels wake up America the news is lying to you
I suspect that Heisenberg knows what went down.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN SLEEPY BIDEN LETS IN   drug dealers.    TRUMP WILL WIN 2024
"...cause of death?"  I'm going to go out on a limb here and speculate that the numerous bullet holes in the windows of the vehicle may provide a clue.  Are reporters really as stupid as they appear to be?
I guess the USA has just become Mo Mexico
Cartel m, whether it’s money owed for trafficking family members into the US, drug money owed, rival cartel, it’ll trace back to cartel related Id bet. The fact the spokeswoman said, “No matter the circumstances surrounding it, it’s tragic”, says they already know what’s behind the murders and it’s not good.
Hard to care any more
its a shady death it is connected to some illegal transactions
Wow this could have been about drugs , Six poor souls my condolences to the families.
The migrants did this. Let more in
how come nobody is calling this a mass shooting? six shot dead definitely meets the government definition of a mass shooting.
Craigslist always suggests trade in public areas, I wonder what happened
That's some ol' school Anton Chigurh action right there!
In the desert,no one can hear you scream.... Or gun shots!
I remember this particular area when I was stationed at George back in the 70s.
Way too many mass shootings in the US lately. I'd rather live in some other country. If you are thinking about coming in to the US, think about another country to immigrate to.
Bidens open borders.
THEN HELP TEXAS DEFEND THE BOARDER, AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO CRY, AND MOAN ABOUT IT....COME IN LEGAL, OR GTF OUT
🕊️💐🕊️💐🕊️💐🕊️💐🕊️💐🕊️💐
.I think Anton chiger got there before the cops
The spoils of war someone came up on money guns and the product!
Sure would like to know who found them in that remote desert area to begin with. Hmmm....🤔. It's so tragically sad. My condolences to their families 💔🙏
maybe they were attacked by bill cosby
Make borders great again!
This is OPEN BORDER POLICY AND WORK OF THE CARTELS.   HAPPY WITH YOUR VOTE………
we   may  have   a  lot    of   it  like   mexico    cartel   shi
No country for........
🙏
You are not safe in America anymore.
I heard they found some people dead in G a a zz a too.
Don’t run drugs for cartels.
Thanks posters for solving this.   When the real reason is revealed you can all say you thought that too.
Well it's right outside Victorville.....not shocking at all tbh for that city.
Why are so many Mexicans, up to no good?
Wendell:  Well it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff.   Sheriff:  If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here.
It’s gonna get worse. Thanks Joe
I’m sure we’ll be seeing a lot of this
Mexican drug cartels In Mexico are getting guns from Texas
Maybe close the border so that opportunistic cartel members aren't murdering innocent people. At the same time, we can also protect our country and our citizens!
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins. Repent of what the New testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus. The gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved God bless you all. If you have faith in Jesus through your faith you will live life with him as your example.
No Border For Old Men...
The headline was all the information they had. 2min 40 seconds wasted.
This will become part of the regular daily news.
A DRUG DEAL GONE BAD,,,,,,,,,   THEY ALL CERTAINLY WASN'T THERE FOR A MEXICAN CHURCH SOCIAL GATHERING PICNIC.
US is in distress
Anybody remembers "no country for old men"  now like the french say,     "cherches les drogues" et la femme,
Thats alot
10 years or thereabouts, this country will be like cartel Mexico.
No country for old men
Open borders.  Build Back Better working as planned.
It looks like the SUV was trying to turn around. But the white van has zero bullet holes or damage. Strange.
Breaking Bad Luck
Well, that's a shame (Seinfeld voice)
This is a cartel warning to someone, they wanted those bodies to be found
😢😢😢 prayers for the families after there loss.
Can anyone say "Open border"? This is going to result in war on American streets 🤔
WHO     FOUND  THEM   ?   I   WOULD   BE  LOOKING   HARD  INTO  WHY  THEY  WERE  OUT  THERE   TO  BEGIN  WITH   !!!
sounds typical that is a weird county kind of sus
Will this be called a conspiracy theory if I say we need a close our borders? Can the victims families sue the Biden administration on this?
Democrat policies at their finest.
funny how only after the state took over do these death happens, its so sus
I grew up around Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley, we all know there are a lot more bodies out there in those deserts
33,000,000 CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS.  The democrats are keeping the borders open to support the drug cartels
I hear that, thanks to Mr Potatohead, the cartels operate in all 50 states...
Please keep us updated on this situation
So was it a shootout and noone survived?
Biden's America.
Why is the "reporter" wearing a keffiyeh, an Arab Islamist terrorist symbol? Does this channel also allow "reporters" to wear swastikas? Asking for a friend.
No country for old men
California is a mess
Aliens peaced em out
Oh snap, were they citizens of that country or were they just dumped there?
Thanks sleepy joe for keeping us safe.😴
Border related?
No country for old men
Take all the Bodies to the WhiteHouse Kawn in Washington and keave them there. Make Joe Biden see ehat His Pokicies, or acntgere of, are doing. Put Joe R. Biden Jr into Gorced Immigration Action or Out him in jail as an accessory to Murder!
Who called in the tip to check out the remote location? We may never know
Blame Crooked Joe Biden .
They could be kidnapped or lost in the desert.
They forgot there’s no country for old men
I for one would know better than to go meet any shady person people out in the middle of the desert under the cover of darkness. I may see the sun go down but I would know that I will not see it rise again!
"will get justice", i.e, its a crime scene.
A drug deal gone wrong.  If it ain't a mess, it'll do 'till the mess gets there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfRf8Pt2QTs
That's look like drugs related the Mexican Mafia again
Illegals
Deadly Viper Assassination Squad
Everyone immediately assumes it had to do with a drug deal or the cartel.  How do we know it wasn't just a family who was kidnapped and executed to make a statement.  There could be many reasons.  Drugs isn't the only reason people die.  T
*Mmmm.... good thing cell-tower pings, vehicle/phone GPS location, and traffic cameras are used to monitor citizens that have "different think" from the current administration... I don't know, maybe utilize those options to track the Domestic Terrorists that did this... just an idea.*
Don't hate the PLAYERS, hate the GAME! AMERICA is the most DRUGGED nation on the PLANET! AMERICANS spend more on LEGAL and ILLEGAL drugs than any other nation! DEMAND fuels the drug trade in AMERICA, not ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! A lot to be said for nations that have STRICT NO DRUG LAWS that punish drug SALES, POSSESSION and USE!
I LIVE 17  MIN FROM THE SITE AND I CAN TELL YOU IN ADELANTO THIS IS NOT NEWS AS THIS LONE DESERT WITH LIMITED OFFICERS IS DANGEROUS AND CITIZENS  SHOULD BE ALLOWED WALK ARMED.   IN THE  ABANDONED AIR BASE PEOPLE FIND CRAZY STUFF. I DONT LET MY WIFE GO OUTSIDE WITH MY BABY UNLESS IM THERE WITH HER READY FOR ANYTHING NOT EVEN TO WALLMART.
Probably people who decided to keep some of the money instead of handing it over to the cartels.
I smell cartel. Otherwise, what do I know about is absolutely nothing. It is scary to think about...
Get rid of G Newsome. He welcomes this mess
No Country For Old Men. Remember that one?
How about we close the border?
We shall all face Jesus - may God be with them💗
Ambushed.
They were dumped there😮
Hold Democrats responsible
Not this happening 15 minutes away from me 💀✋🏽
Joe Biden's new America.
Drogas es muerte.
Walter White and Mike smoking the Salamanca Brother's....Fring is worried....very worried....
taco deal  gone sour cream
I think Heisenberg did it.
Well ... What do you think is going to happen.. keep harboring  illegals..  and crazy leftists.   You'll keep getting stupid prizes. ! Congratulations cali. You truly are the joke of the nation
Dope deal gone bad.
Biden's border crossers up to drug dealing
I don’t live anywhere near a desert and I’m wondering Are they really just used for shady things or do people hang out in them for other regular reasons?
Oh poor illegal aliens
Gang banger drug deal gone afoul? Just a guess.
CARTEL
Let me guess  No suspects  No motive  No real clues
Don't these people have jobs? Or do they live selfishly off my 🇺🇸 tax dollars? 🖕🇮🇱
These bodies are all on Biden.
THEY COULDN'T PAY THE CARTEL, SO THEY PAID THE PRICE.!!!!!  BIDEN NEEDED HIS CUT!!!!!!
U have any ideal how many Norco associates have crossed the boarder under the democratic party. Bringing that bs to our lands.
🦋🦋🕊️🛐🌹🌹
Sure glad our borders are open.
Bidens cartel America
get use to it
Motive - drugs guns money Perpetrators - gang or Mexican cartel Victims - unfortunate shady people Crime solved
Drug deal gone wrong.
Why do t be clear?? Say if they got shot ,etc dumb news fr
We’ve all seen breaking bad and sons of anarchy … we all know exactly what happened here’s….
nbcla news is not news it's brain washing bullsh8t
There’s a federal prison not too far from that place
Ooops!....Juan and Chico weren't working late at the restaurant Maria.
There is a lot of illegal weed grows in adelanto. Why is the “objective” reporter Christian wearing pro Hamas Keffiyeh?! Wonder where the new station stands on Israel
Bet almost all of them were illegal
Car ,ppl, in the middle of the desert , exactly how far would you go for a fistful of dollars?  I'm sorry for the families, no one deserves this.
No country for old men scene.
"6?" The Joker
Third World people bring third world problems, America is dead.
Drug run gone wrong more then likely
Better call Sal vs Narcos
The curse of Santo Mayorkas.
Thanks joe biden!!!
Not to jump into any conclusions, but that area is known for high concentration of meth labs and drug dealers
Everyone saying it’s a drug deal gone bad because who would meet up with someone  out in the middle of no where but what if scenario B came to play where they were kidnapped from a different location and were executed out in the desert for many other multiple reasons has anyone ever thought about that ?
thats the work of the Mexican Cartel  - they are spread across the US in places nobody would suspect, controlling guns, drugs and gambling + prostitution in nearly every state  ~ the police do not do their jobs, they are too busy handing out tickets and hassling people rather than doing the real work of stopping gang violence and mafia in in their districts.     In the USA, you are on your own, don't get involved with bad actors.
This is just page 1 of a never-ending book. . . a bloody picture book.😣
Well who owns the vehicles that were there?
Damn just last Sunday in Chicago suburbs 7 people where killed in a home and another 4 where killed in a different incident involving the dad killed all of them smh
Palestine has been averaging 250/day (with children) for the last 110 days from your Treasury. #YourTaxesAtWork 💥🧨💥💯
Plenty women are hoping that it was all men who were killed.
Cartels making it known that they are here and taking over. Smh.
Cartel crap. Investigation completed.
💔
Border patrol had plenty of access but did not save these 6.   Shame Shame
Keep mexico in mexico...
Police are looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Man someone needs to deputize all these YT sherlock holmes. Ooen and shut case according to them.
Family members sure hiding their faces...so important
Money is over? Life is gone. Coyotes stole and killed them.
No country for old men
gangs and drug dealers, and people smuglers everywhere now. Oh ya, the head of all of this is crap in the white house.
Mexican coyotes
No dope? Human traffickers, nobody made it out alive. Business disagreement.
Close the borders….fund the polices….
Gee, who loves the desert to dump bodies? Guess who but they aren’t from here. Sad state of affiars
Mexican cartel is operating in all 50 states, plus DC.
Did those Mississippi officers get to them?
This looks like a scene from No Country For Old Men !!!
Anyone can figure out by the used needles around Hesperia high desert that they got dope problems and where you find needles and addicts, you'll find Mexican drug peddling and smuggling. They do it all day everyday. Look at the people heading to the crime scene to "find family members". Maybe time to ask questions to them and quit that pandering to dope people and their families.
its cuz they walked thru cartel run territory .... dont walk into the san bernadino desert y'all
So sorry for all the lives lost
Any American citizens involved?  No I didn't think so.
Was is climate change? Dammit! Quick, start paying "climate taxes."
Good job Biden keeping these borders open I’m sure this will be seen a lot more now
Welcome illegals immigrants.this is the future
Joseph Biden is 💯 % responsible for the deaths of these people. And the missing 100,000 innocents
No new information. So lets report that 24/7. Useless N.E.W.S station.
cartel bussines
Better get used to this kind of thing, Joe biden's cartels will be spreading across the country soon as they slowly turn America into a Mexican sh*t-hole.
Just one of many casualties do to Bidens open border policies .
Damn
Cartel hit!!@!!
We just want a better life, how did that work out? My Condolences, I don’t believe our government gives a crap!?
Who called for the welfare check and WHY?????!!??
WOW!  Your Reporting On THIS STORY is HORRIBLE!  ABC Had A LOT More Details On The Story THREE HOURS AGO!!!  Your Stpory Is Full Of Holes And Leaves Out ALL KINDS OF DETAILS That Are Factual, Proven, Seen and THREE HOURS OLD!
Newsome will blame Trump and Republicans
Probably some of those evil white supremacists.  They are the main threat to our country you know.
Why women shouldn't vote
Thank you President Biden for keeping everyone safe....oh, wait.
Location of killary Clinton
U ever notice how murder is normal in everyday America and as a rule were becoming a third world country, maybe I can marry my last daughter off to a 5 foot 2 Aztec warrior and she can bare the new American people
Heisenberg 🕶
The Mexican gangs are in California duking it out ?
Open borders 😂
Where's Alec????
Get use to more third world crime, your importing it.
Sounds like that "south of the border" stuff thats now here in our yards but the border is secure. Yeah right!
Well pretty much gang or cartel are almost everywhere in the desert… my question is what where they  doing out there? I don’t see any home?..
Cartel members will all give an account to the Lord, in the end!!!
Don't deal drugs and don't take drugs.
Christ is Lord, and he will avenge their deaths!!!
Bless their souls gome, Lord Jesus!!!
Bidens America, lock your doors, Biden let these people through the border, for votes and Biden dont care , when its your turn to get wasted away, Democrats dont care.
Repent and seek Jesus
Drugs cartel pending business$$$$$
Biden is getting a kick back from the cartel and China what a piece of garbage he is
Same news as this morning. Btw, it's pronounced San Burna-deeno not Bernard-ino. I lived there as a child..
Its giving breaking bad. Gives me the heebeejeebees
This is like 1/1000th of what Gavin Newsom ignores going on in California's deserts and national/state parks.  At this point they could  have been runover by a herd of illegal aliens.
When you let the illegals in crime will follow
Oh boy! I mean all they need to find out is which cartel did it 🤷‍♂️
Slowly they are getting it done it seems  Wake up 😢
Yesterday it was 5 people. What gives?
i wonder if there ok
Illegals
No Country For Old Men
"No Country For Old Men" vibes
All because of a nonexistent southern border.
Wo
No country for old men
Cause of death?  Suv was riddle with bullets and bodies were burned. 🤦‍♂️
every marker on the ground was a shell casing.
I THINK THE LE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND THEIR IDENTITIES! LOOK IN THEIR PHONES! EVERYBODY HAS CELL PHONES!!!!!
Vigilantes ? 😢
Thank you democrats for making this the new normal. Absolutely disgusting how democrats have destroyed our country in three years.
American vigilantes wanting payback for border overflow.
Drug deal gone bad
https://maps.app.goo.gl/kTT5enTo36YJzh6J7
JUST A GUESS BUT LOOKS LIKE DRUG RELATED😮
Psychotic
Not unhappy about it. They were migrants trying to come illegally.
El Camino
Cartel, border coyote, or drug deal gone wrong. Doesn’t take a genius to figure that out sadly
“No country for old man” 😂
There is nothing good happening in the desert. 😢 recipe for  disaster.
Cartels be trippin
Drug deal gone wrong with drug mafia.
@That chapter
Cartel members just want a better life.
Cartel business
Climate change caused it, right commies?
Drugs....
Were these Americans?
Coming to a neighborhood near you. Thanks Joe Biden.
How's that open border working for you Commiefornia?
✝️✡️Eternal Father, I offer Thee the most precious blood of your son Jesus in union with all the Masses being said all over the world this day for the souls in purgatory ❤
Death squads ..or drug deal gone bad
CARTEL:  "Meet us out in the desert at night for the transaction" BUYERS: "Ok! Seems legit!"
Check their phone numbers and messeges
The border is secure.
Ok but tell us the full story as you get it from those who not only informed you they were out there but those who came to identify the bodies
Where they coming to America
Biden voters or future voters .
appears to be cartel activity.
Cartel
I would like to know the US Citizenship status of the six.
So sad
Democrats!
Yes it's here now.just like mexico. 😮
What else are they dealing out there meth coco weed blues fentanyl and lots of cash 💰
Looks like they took back up but without any real gunfire, they came to  The wrong fight with a handgun probably
Governor newscum and brandon welcomes the cartel to Kalifornia.  Cause of death?  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess all the bullet holes might have had something to do with it.
I hate to say it but your family members were riding super dirty, people don't meet in the middle of the desert for just a friendly ol visit...
Drug deal gone wrong lots of pounds of some time of substance for sure
On the road?  Means they wanted the bodies found.
Probably drug deal went wrong , 🤷🏻‍♂️
Much earlier reports already established that all of the victims were shot to death.🥺🙈😬😟🙉😫
biden's border jumpers were involved no doubt.  either dead in the car or doing the killing or both.  American needs law and order again, vote for it this November.  California is pathetic because of its polotics.
A fent party?
Joe Biden’s Crimerica
Coyote did it ?
Cartel did it
Meth is a mofo. 😂
Crime pays in the desert
