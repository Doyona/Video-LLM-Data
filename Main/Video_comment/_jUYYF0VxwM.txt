wow orlando looking rough. Hes past his prime for sure.
I hate that 0:16 wasn't in the final film
thanks for enrertsianment
Does anyone know the name of the music in the twitch version of this trailer? I can't find it anywhere. but I'm pretty sure I heard it in an old car racing game. I thought it was most wanted but it turns out it wasn't
No Miata uphill race? 5/10
GERI brought me here
0:42  and funny
Araba filmleri beni hep heyecanlandırdı
Çok iyi bir film helal olsun böyle devam
WTF? Where is the iconic Maserati Gran Turismo MC GT4 Trofeo.
Çok güzel filim
0:33 AYOO SUSSS?!?!
Звуки уже меня радуют, напоминают прохождение этой игры❤
Calsonic be there
At least this will probably be much better than the family and furious movie 🗿
the 3 horns in the beginning counting down gives me goosebumps
Loosing my favorit game song Im hoping to hear in the movie. I mean come on now.. ,")
WARE THE F.T.O AND MY TEN GRAN 😎🖖🚬🥃🆒👍
This shit is so cringe 😂 anything to squeeze money out of the braindead gen z 😂
The love story is the best part in the gran turismo series
Big fan of the Gran Turismo games, the movie looks sweet, Neil Blomkamp’s District 9 was a masterpiece, plus solid cast, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, the Gran Turismo movie should be amazing 👏👏👏
This looks amazing.
This isn't a real GT film unless there's wall riding and the main character failing their licence tests over and over
Somebody has to make the Liveries after the movie comes out
This better not have a single CGI racing shot. Ironically enough
It is from Sony, it will be rubbish. Sony is only good at making Spiderman movies.
Romance??? Ah damnit. Don’t spoil this iconic legendary name!!!! This isn’t NFS or Fast saga.   If you gonna do it, do it like Tom Gun 2, it’s subtle but not too much, just right
thought this was actual gameplay from  GT7 replays.
Need for Speed is never getting a sequel so this is a close second I guess
I love David Harbour
Just gonna throw is out there. Jack and Daxter live action 👀
Hopefully they will include lag spikes in the move too
Looks pretty good
The whole movie is going to be the protagonist race a full lap around the nürburgring in a SLR mclaren trying to close a 123 seconds gap
Get ready
I hope they give us *the* song 😭
Going to sound insane on them speakers
What's next? Euro Truck Simulator movie?
Wish my father was still alive, I would have loved to watch this with him, this was one of a few things I can count on one hand that we had a similar connection to.
Absolutely clears Fast X / Fast & Furious
The main theme gotta be moon over the castle
I think that romance would be like they did in District 9
getcho love story out my simcade racing game
this seems neat but... why is it gran turismo exactly? like it doesn't really seem to make this movie a gran turismo movie if nothing about it really seems like something that could only be in gran turismo, especially since its based on a true story which i assume had nothing to do with GT in the first place.
I might go see this, but I don't have the latest PlayStation consoles and don't have the latest Gran Turismo games. Can I be in the sequel?
This is in regards to gt7....POLYPHONY IF UR READING THIS STOP SENDING EXOTICS WE WANT 90S 80S 2000S STREET CARS! WE WANT SHITBOXES THAT CAN LOVE AND MOD.  STOP GIVING US THESE EASY TO DRIVE EXOTICS . THE DANBASE ASKIN FOR THESE DONT EVEN PLAY LIKE THAT THEY JUST LOUD..WE WANT STREET CARS. NO MORE EXOTICS
my question out of all the execlusives sony has that they can make into a movie why gran turismo why not GOW, Uncharted, sackboy oout of all of them they choose a racing game im ot sad im confused
Probably the main antagonist of this film is the pace car
True life story whaaaat?
If theres not references/jokes to the Ford gt, Yellow evo, IA-15, Pace car, Gt 2000, the weird futuristic cars then its not a gran turismo movie
Looks soulless fr
I think it would be cool if they had Michael Fassbender in this movie would be cool plus he a race car drive n actor
This movie is gonna bomb.
Please please focus on the Atmos soundtrack
I'm not excited what so ever. We don't need a love story tied into racing. I think this will be a giant flop.
that corny love subplot is so dumb why do they always shoehorn that in? like just make a movie bout a kid trying to be the best racer and have him over come obstacles that make him better in the long run.
Stiill waiting for metal gear
Is it going to be a action movie
Blomkemp is such a remarkable film maker . District 9 his still his best movie
If they don’t use garbage and the cardigans for the soundtrack is it even gran turismo??
I love how the GT games basically have zero plot or narrative, but for some reason they are adapting the game into a movie. 😆
Love the game. But this movie looks like crap . It looks like a high school class Project.
Crash Bandicoot
Its cool and all but.... you lost me at, "It's a love story." Keep it about Gran Turismo.
This is going to be bad I can already just tell.
This would definitely sell better if it were a Wipeout movie.
They better bring that yellow Evo 5, or else it'll be plain
Oh Boy!!!! I can’t Wait!!! Hopefully it’s great just like Disney Pixar Cars!!!!!!🏁🏁🏁🏁
Lol this will be total and utter shit
iracing : dude you wouldn't do this to me
No mention of Neill Blompkamp?
0:13 I think I see Toastie here. I'm literally crying tears of joy
If they ain't breaking the speed of sound in a real life RBX2019 then I ain't coming.   But in seriousness the sneak peek looks good.
Half way through the cinema version a “5 second penalty” will come up on the screen and the audiences will scream in rage at what it was they did to warrant the punishment.
I'm excited, so much childhood memories racing on "The Green Hell" in the Skyline GT-R
NEED FOR SPEED live-action ( 2014 ) ⬅️🕰️ GRAND TURISMO live-action ( 2023 ) ➡️🕰️
I think is better version of [ TALLAGEDA NIGHTS: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby ] ( 2006 ) ⬅️🕰️🤔💭
GOODBYE Fast saga ( 2001-2023 )☹️😢 🚗 🚙 🏁
Didn't even knew Neill Blomkamp would have the balls to adapt a video game to a film. Love it! But I wanted a sequel from Chappie or District 9 or maybe Elysium. Guess this is the one I'll be excited for.
we all know who wins.. nis....
“Based on a true story…” We’re screwed. 🤦‍♀️
The love story should be between the driver and the car........
Lets put some Fat Boy Slim-f*king in heaven somewhere in that movie !
What tf!!! Where have I been? Wow. This is awesome. I’m so stoked.
They need that criminal good intro music at the start
A racing movie based on the story of GT Academy that also turns out to be a bit of a love story? Sign me up! Those are all gimmicks I can get behind!
seems like a very bad concept for a movie i understand its based loosely on a real story but it just seems dumb of all the things Sony games have that are unique they chose a racing game - it would be ok if GT was the best racing game but it is barely in the top 3
The first car shown, has to be a Demio. And also, don't forget, when you crash, the cars don't get damage! Oh, and half way thru the movie, they have to boot you out of the cinema without warning  I'm also confused - there is 0-story plot in this 'racing sim'. The only plot is the gamers spending too long on it, grinding for credits
Right in the core memories…Laguna Seca, I can close my eyes and feel that track.
If daiki kashos all my life isn’t the theme of this movie I will be very disappointed
How has gran turismo died in such a strange manner? Also this looks like shit. Imagine watching whatever this is supposed to be then playing the game..
Spare me the love story please. Just give me a movie about cars.
''Movie typically signify the death of a franchise, so this may not be good news.''  Technically the franchise is dead. They killed gaming in general with online locking single player games, add there lootboxes, transactions, downloads, etc list goes on  With that said I will just mention one thing GTSport. That game was online locked and milked to death with spoon feeding content for years. I lost count nor care to look it up.  So this movie not being their 1st it still is their 1st one that contains cringe and irrelevant content mixing with GT franchise.  They killed their own core consumer base and community so out of desperation they make these silly easy to cashgrab projects. When a game doesn't sell well, make a next step, make a base movie slap an IP onto it and put it on a streaming platform, job done. From this they move to other things where they can get money till they don't anymore.
If they play moon over the castle in the end credits, I’m going to cry tears of joy
Who played gran turismo and said,” the game is good and all but i need a love story “
This is wierd
I guess ruining the game was a sign they needed to cash out with a movie?  Fire the microtransaction thugs.
The movie better have Moon Over the Castle at the start or the end of the film.
Now if they can only get the actual game to sound this good...
It's not a true Gran Turismo experience unless it's relentlessly delayed
I got a feeling the plot is gonna revolve around GT Academy. Doesn't mean I'm not gonna go watch it.
What a bizarre concept
Are they gonna make a FIFA film next?
You can leave the romance out, I'm just here for the cars.
Damn, I didn't know this was happening. Looks cool
Hooper???? I’m down
On in movie theaters??? Does that mean it out there is no date 😂
They better include moon over the castle, it not Gran Turismo without it
Wake me up when “Burnout” hits theaters
Imagine moon over the castle playing while the finale race
ASUS
I am going to see this movie for sure. All the playstation movies are good. I loved Ratchet and Clank back in 2016. Uncharted in 2022 was a great movie for me. I hope this movie is my favorite.
Реклама Тойоты
Hungaroring wahoo =)
Very good
Cringe
waitng for forza movie
Wtf i know gran turismo as a game. Its a purely racing car game but now in this movie its a love story😂😂wtf how can they change the racing perspective to a love story.  I have all the gran turismo games but there is no love stories i played its purely race and cars thats all
I’m still taking my license test though.
Sounds exciting
wow dudes wow amazing wow it's going to beat all  other movies wow dude wow dude just kidding this is going to be shit!
my man fix yo damn game 😭
Magyarok! Nem tudom, hogy nektek ismerős e a pálya..😏
You better have "Moon Over The Castle" playing 😀
There better be a race with all street cars and that one cheating bastard AI with the LeMans GT car 😂
didn't even know this was coming out
As long as the song "moon over the castle" or "everything must go" plays, then I would consider this movie a win
Love story, I have to watch love drama and people fake kissing. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why make video games into films what next the getsway
Video games that become movies  1 : sonic the hedgehog  2 : super Mario bros  3 : gran turismo  4 : Max Payne                                but where is GTA movie🙂
The helicopter can't keep up with those cars
A movie about overcoming the coffee break missions
I hope the first racing scene goes like this. “WELCOME ALL RACER TO THE ANNUAL SUNDAY CUP RACE AT THE WILLOW SPRINGS RACEWAY!”
judging by this video, this film's gonna be a big dumpster fire. "it's a movie based on a true life story filled with 'heart-pounding action, drama it's a love story'".. what..?? can you repeat that?? because I don't understand what they're talking about and probably neither do they. I assume they have no idea what they want this film to be because they try to cram all aspects that make a film "worth watching" or "desirable" into one film that's solely meant to be about cars and the drivers the main protagonist is meant to compete with. not this "quirky gamer car guy gets to be in the gt academy and has a crush on this hot chick" bs..
Wondering if they'll have to update the movie 5 or 6 times to iron out glitches.
Who will be the a hole driving the Hawk SRT and lap everyone ？ 😂
With Gran Turismo 8 coming in 4 years time, they should add the movie into Gran Turismo 8 in 2026 as a story mode.
Every since COVID everyone movie is suddenly “ made for the cinema”
There is ZERO need for this to exist. If GT aspires to be a more serious simracer, a movie won't help one bit.
For this to give the audience any semblance of realism, they need to have the opponents get away with ramming the main character off the track, but give the penalty to the main character for violating track limits, costing him the race. Cue credits.
Blomkamp la parte sin bichos
God of war, super giga wars and giants.
It would be funny if they had the main character doing the final Super license test
Never thought that there would ever be a movie about Gran Turismo.  Can we get a movie about Tokyo Xtreme Racer?
I have no idea what a GT movie can be about, but I hope it's just an excuse for lots of racing.
Still PD hasn't fixed the damn penalty system.
Nfs shift 1 join in gran Turismo 7
Do they also take 30 minutes to browse cars while listening to Squad?
If this movie is in Philippine Theaters, I'm happy.
Why is this a movie 🤣
WTF? This is cool, but on the other hand, I'm struggling for words.
I bet that awkward kiss shot was added by some corporate snob. He was probably like "I think uhh it's missing something.... Hey can you kiss a girl real quick? Wait, lemme just take out my iPhone and...."
No love story 🤦‍♂
I love Gran Turismo and I hope it's good but I think we all know it's going to be pretty shit unfortunately lol. The cars should look cool if nothing else
hope they include Fatboy Slim F***ing in Heaven Simons GT Mix
Take the fuckin romance OUT !!
Nobody asked
Ale gówno😂
The only good racing film is days of thunder
Nooo waay😍😍😍
Wait... What?!
Please dear god do not let this movie have a normal movie score please use the GT OSTs of yesteryear or something similar
@EmeliaHartford looks awesome, can't wait!!! 😁
The last Sony movie game was Uncharted..... Yeah not excited at all after you f**ked that easy slam dunk up.
What. The. Fxxk?
While I love the franchise, I don’t think Hollywood should touch it.
Never thought GT would ever have a movie…
There better be micro transactions, and grinding
Well...movies based in videogames just get better and better so I'll keep my expectations.
Will there be a climax race on Special Stage Route X
Morbius better be in this.
At least the car sounds better in the movie
Having a love story might convince my wife to go with me to watch this
can’t beat Top Gun though
It just needs to be 3 hours of tweaking your suspension setup for Suzuka
Anybody but David freaking Harbour 😑
You guys are jealous because Nintendo making their own movie  🤬 Sony. 🤬 Play station
Wait, they're making a Gran Turismo movie?????
If they do theatrical scores of GT3 and 4 music, this will be incredible.
Moon over the castle. And Lenny Kravitz
This sneak peek is already better than the Need for Speed movie...lol
They better have a test to get their license and the cool music needs to be played and is god of war going to be a movie or series or is dmc going to be a series and god of war a movie
NO WAY THIS CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD!! This is gonna be fricking sick!
This movie will be really cool
This would be the last time we see Gran Turismo as the series would be in Hiatus for perhaps several years.
Not really liking the one-shot drone camera shots with excessive camera movements.
This shit looks like it was filmed by a college student
Shut up and take my money!
Games have been trash since part 4 and this looks no different.
Vision gt its ur time to shine
IMAX for engine music
Seems like it's gonna have decent sound
What, da, actual... 😧
I stop watching the video when he said love story
Where are the everyday people mobiles? If it's just going to be race cars, I'll pass. I can watch that in real life.
Orlando bloom in a gran turismo movie....i never thought it before
Why can’t Jann film it himself?
0:13 sound of that GTR is just 😍👌
Better have Daiki Kasho music.
NO COFFEE BREAK SCENE???
Here we go, another game boutta get it’s legacy ruined by the big screen for no fucking reason
Why ?
cool! I'll be seeing it
This movie better be better than the need for speed movie if not just as good, I really hope they don't make a mess of things and hopefully they add in some easter eggs for avid players...
could have been a movie franchise if the movie started from stock car racing with a used car and the main character going through license challenges before getting to Gr.1 24 Heures Le Mans. the main character could be the greatest driver ever since they could race in rally or drifting but nope, they skipped through all that with a tucked in unwanted romance. what a missed opportunity this one is.
Will the cars have genders?🤣
I’d love to watch this
I just got GT7 2 weeks ago first gt since I played GT2 Which I believe had the most cars I am now back in love with gran turismo
Gran Turismo has a story?!?! I'm pretty sure Marvel vs. Capcom has more of a story than any Gran Turismo game
CANT WAIT
Romance.....you mean between the man and his personal car right?
Why does there need to have romance in this movie? The romance part is pointless, no one is watching this movie for it's useless romance.
Why they don't wear Tuxedo?
Wait is this bases om the game
This better not turn into 10 movies like fast and furious 🤣🤣🤣
The world of champions!
Not a fan of all those drone shots.
I hope the romance isn’t cringe
So it's a story about a race car driver?  Of all the games to possibly make a movie about, this might be the worst one
The hell? Why make a movie out of a sim game? Either way, I'm interested to see how this turns out...
I’m looking forward to seeing the camera angles.
Gran Turismo is getting a movie? Nice!!!!  I didn't know Gran Turismo is getting a movie! 🚗🚘🏎️ I'm in! Better than Need for Speed '14 & Fast & Furious! Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino already had its fun, now it's Gran Turismo's turn! This is gonna be like Top Gun, Days of Thunder, Ford V Ferrari, and Talladega Nights!
why
That chase cam wins it for me! I've got a feeling the story isn't gonna be great, but the racing scenes and everything surrounding the cars will be top drawer stuff
This is going to be boring just like the games.
I like GT but who asked for this?! 😂 Why does this series need a movie
Thing is, how much Japanese influence will there be? From playing the game, there are many jdm cars that can be customized and driven. Those GTRs are they right hand drive for example?
If Super GT doesn’t Cameo in this movie I swear to god
Knowing Neil Blomkamp is directing makes me hella interested.
As extensive as the game is, the movie better be a 10 hours long 3 part full feature film
0:34 did no sim nerd ever 🤣
Give exclusive content to those who got GT7
I'm a forza fan, but I sure as h3ll am definitely gonna watch this.
If online lobbies are anything to go by the first corner is going to be expensive.
Is Lotus going to be in the movie? 🥲
Legolas is doing this?? Wicked!
I feel like this movie might revolutionise the games if it turns out good. Just like how street fighter 2 animated movie made the game what it is today. Gt game might start to use some action style effects
so instead of a DLC for the new GT game, we get a live action campaign movie that no body ask for
Please bring this movie and please dub in Hindi language for Indian Audiences with Its original English audio language.
This is the dumbest thing ever and I love gt
WHY MOVIE THEATERS? What a waste of money. Bring it on the usual streaming apps like Netflix, Prime etc.
The next big flop
Will the title theme be My Favourite Game, from The Cardigans?
welp i expect this movie to have a bad storyline
I hope they include the car wash scene.
The credits better start with all the people responsible for the camera work. 🤯
Yellow evo v cameo when?
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
We all know is going to suck like GT7
Man, this PlayStation 7 graphics look amazing!
Truly one of the movies of all time.
The game sucks! Coming from a Gran turismo 1, 2, 3 and 4 Hard-core veteran player
4 Stages of emotions during the sneak peak  Gran Turismo movie has heartfelt 200MPH racing action:     YES !!!!!!!!!!! Movie will move you straight in between the racing action:    HELL YES !!!!!! Movie has drama :                                                                           Ummm..... And a love story :                                                                             Noooo !!!!!!!!!!!
I want a lambo v12 vision gt from gt7 in the movie
My favorite racing games of all time...😃😃😃👍👍👍5/5
I just love how they can't make a decent racing game but can make movie
5oul on D!splay better be in the soundtrack
If this movie doesn't use Moon Over The Castle as the main theme, I will be heavily disappointed. Heck, I think Masahiro Andoh should do the entire soundtrack all together!
There's no hope
Fast franchise is fantastic but this will be a franchise keeping it cars and adrenaline. Cannot wait to experience this in 4DX 🥳
5OUL ON D!SPLAY needs to be the intro song .
Honestly, I think it would be better as a TV series, considering that the career mode of the games would make a good foundation to simulate a life of a race car driver. From a young teen prodigy driving in the Sunday Cup to making a name for themselves at the 24 Hours of Nurburgring.
Oh wow Video game movie
Fast and Furious should take notes
I think this is the 25th Anniversary of Gran Turismo franchise, they nailed it since Gran Turismo 7 was return last year in 2022.
We all know the movie is going to s**k b**ls.
There had better be a Translator San cameo in this!
Ive never ever thought in a Gazillion years that there would be such an epic move for a Master piece of a Game
Uhg I can already see the drone chase cam shots are going to be abused to death
This movie consist of two hours of suspension settings 🎉
now we need the crew movie, the Forza movie, dirt ,burnout and the out run movies. oh. pole position  and Daytona usa and the Colin Mcrae rally video game movie. rock and roll racing movie and crazy taxi.
I want to see "Carmageddon: The Movie". Go implement a love story into that sh*t, motherf*ckers!
At least.. PLEASE PUT A SONG "EVERYTHING MUST GO (CHEMICAL BROTHERS REMIX)" IN IT :")
I hope the movie will run 4K60fps
This looks great. I just wish there were more women in it, who aren't there as a love interest for a man. As a girl addicted to playing gran turismo, I always find it sad that it is always men shown in the game, playing the game or talking about the game.
I can bet the 1 lap magic mission 34 with batmans molossus as bgm is much more intense than this
No love story please
Main character should start out driving a Toyota Yaris or a Daihatsu
they'll give you a half backed movie full of micro transactions you gota pay extra for sound and actors to speek lol
I guarantee Orlando's character gets injured while racing David's character and then Orlando becomes mentor/crew chief for that other young actor.
YAAASSSS!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want a full decked out cafe scene!
Holy shit,  Finally a movie that can compete with RUSH
I will watch this if there is wall riding involved!
I have one question WHY.
aint worth watching unless youre a real serious racing addict
I feel Niel Blomkamps talents are wasted here, anyone can direct racing movie, but not anyone can create unique scfi masterpices like him. Still, am gonna watch this just because am huge fan of his.
I want it to be good but I just don’t know.
15% better be the License 90% has to be races 4% has to be the pit stop and car 1% of the romance
I did not expect for GT to become a movie all of a sudden, I think this is worth watching
because we all love gran turismo for the love storys
If they don't include the Escudo Pikes Peak then it's a failure. 😎
In theater only?  Seems kinda foolish since the target audience is people who want to stay home and race cars on their home TV.
The only love story I care about is the relationship with my starter car.
Omg it’s a masterpiece Sony you guys blew me away🥹🥹🥹🥹
At first I was skeptical about this idea. But then I remembered how f-king amazing Gran Turismo is as a game. I hope it has amazing driving scenes! And best you understand it if you have played the Gran Turismo.
PLEASE TAKE THE VENOM TO AVENGERS!
I wonder if this comes out will it leave the same footprint that Ford vs. Ferrari did in the car world?
Sooo.....the cars gonna have no damage then??
I love this favorite racing movie Gran Turismo Movie live action video racing game on theater!
Gran Turismo isn't really a game fit for a film adaptation to me...    Welp...let's see I guess
Some of those drone like shots remind me of the one from Ambulance (2022)
Never thought I'd be this excited for a video game movie. But it's also based on a true story.  Although when I heard about there being romance in this film, I went to check if the real Jann had been in any relationships in the past, so most of the answers are "there's not that much info about that". so it's either that this romance thing is made up by the screenwriters or Jann has been in past relationships but he just doesn't talk about them. But none the less, I have hope for this film, the Cinematography looks pretty damn cool.
How about an actual trailer
They should add "Oh Yeah" by Yello for the movie soundtrack 😂
If you are watching Racing movies and there isn't drama and love 💕 story than it's of no use of watching. And in every racing 🏎️🏁 flick, Drama and romance love story are the plus point of these types of movies.
coffee break?
Are they also gonna use Replica versions of Vision GT cars?
I did not know they were filming in Hungary
As someone who has been playing gt on ps from the starting, this is so awesome!  Hope the lag in lobby is fixed in the movie😝
I have a very bad feeling……… That stinks A LOT.
Can we watch the main character complete the game 100% in this movie or is that to much? 🤔 😂
this is such clownery who asked for this?
Sony executive who's just snorted a line of cocaine: "you know what everyone loves about Gran Turismo? It's romance sub-plot."  Sony producer: "let's fund a movie about that by increasing the cost of our Playstation 5's worldwide, but just not in the USA."
Who needs love story in a racing movie 😂
Sony, if you want to appeal to actual car people, you should probably recognize that you have actual car people in your cast, i.e. Emelia Hartford, and showcase them!
These mfs were making a movie instead of giving us content in the game
Extras?
If I had the opportunity I bet I could pull off the same feat. Just not much you can do in Small Town, TX with no money.
I remember that guy's story. Yeah, I have to concede that that WOULD make for a good film plot, maybe good enough to get past the stigma of "video game movies."
Oh great, instead of a plotless teaser it's basically the actors themselves inviting everyone! This should be the new trend for future movie teasers moving forward. 🎬🎬🎬
So once you get all Gold on the license test, she will fall in love with you and she’s your prize?
Kofun is that you?
Nah its okay...i'm waiting for Forza Horizon movie starring Vin Deisel first.
Why are you using cars that aren't even in the games?
As much as I like the actors, this movie sounds so boring.  If the cars crash into each other, I assume there will be no damage like the game.
Why didn’t you just make a trailer instead of this?
Looks good, but doesn’t feel as exciting as Ford v Ferrari
I guess I am not watching this sense its only in theaters....
0:33 why? Why?? Girls? Eww...i want to see cars!
Cinema comes August 8/11/2023 gran turismo live action I’m so excited
Remove the love story and just focus on the Micheal bay type cinematography and the RACING itself.It’s extremely unneeded as it could ruin the pacing and that time could possibly be used for something else i.e more character dev rather than some sub plot
I really hope the romance won't ruin whatever this has going for it. My expectations are low.
a love story?
Don't know what a love story is doing there and how any man would be interested in one. But that they for real make a movie out of my all time favourite game period, is crazy. Hope it's not oriented on GT Sport though
Can't wait for the car wash scene.
So THIS is why I’ve been getting that group b short film in my recommends lol. Because I’m always watching rally videos… *guy below me is dumb
They better have yellow lancer evo V/VI
Is it April already?
No way
I think Porsche did it better with Michael Fassbender. Not a movie, but an episodic reality series. Pure racing and motorsport content, and it's free on youtube.
Whack. The idea for the original gran turismo was to drive and modify stock cars. Had almost nothing to do with race cars and no one I knew actually used the race cars in the games. Poor job once again by Hollywood using the same boring concept that's done time and time again. Best motoring is more of a gran turismo movie than this
Nah... Wanna watch a good Motorsport movie, watch Senna...
0:52 Special Stage Route X?
Bravo....
We don’t need a love story!!
Its a race movie with a love story...im out.
You somehow managed to slip a kissing scene in there. Right.. Because the first 10 words that pop in my head picturing GT, there's definitely "romance" and "kissing"..? GT shouldn't be that meme action movie stuff, it's about motorsport and a pinch of classic jazz music. GT has a particular unique feel as a game that I don't see here.
LOL, how about start making games for your dead ps5?
I fucking hate that font.
Why the love story you had me hooked right until then now I've lost complete interest but I hope this is good so it's not just another shit video game movie but I doubt I'll be watching it now
Spoiler: there’s no car scratches and damage in the movie.
Go Emelia !!
Looked ok until I saw Doofus Bloom. I’ll pass thanks.
This movie is about SIM racing gamer become real racer??????  Omaygot, gentleman please do not make fiction story about gamer become profesional racer  Racing SIM is only for driver to remember about the condition of the track like the corner and straight
Looks like the Hungaroring track with rumble strips painted to look like Le Man's... hmm?
Il watch this because of archie madekwe in it ❤❤❤❤
Archie Madekwe, David Harbour and Orlando Bloom? Wow! 😯👍
If that love story isn't between David Harbour and Orlando Bloom I will want my money back.
Oh God, please for the love of God, don't include unecessary romance.  I just wanna see Racing and Cars.
This is like a dream come true.
WipEout needs to be a motion picture movie.
So they made a movie out of the academy TV show... BFD.  Gonna tell a story that's already been told with a bit of fiction added in just to spice it up....
💙💙💙
This feels like a joke trailer
Sorry but fail film
🔥
Nfs game to movie adaptation was really good and honestly this also looks sick.  Never ever I had thought I would live to see the day of Grand tourismo movie ! The only think which remains uncertain is that will it be accepted in the gaming community cause it will be the major audience source
Hope there's a scene mid race, where the driver gets lost in the menu trying to find the fuel setting but then hits the car next to him because he couldn't see the radar and his car doesn't have a rear view mirror so he moves over to let the guy through, goes a mm over the line and gets a 4 second penalty.
This is gonna suuuuuuck!
They better have the high speed test track to do special GT 1 super super car circuit races not starting from a rolling start and starting from a rolling start as the climax or near climax dramatic highest speed racing experience.
Seems kinda stupid!! Why the hell would anybody make a movie about gran turism? there's no story at all in that game. Remember Need for Speed with Jessy Pinkman, it just didn't work. This isn't art , just executive deals to use brand names to sell you stuff.  I just feel sorry for these actors that are going to have another flop in their resume.
Why the f* a love story. Just show me how the MC chokes sarah to death.
holy shit this looks way better than I expected
Can't wait to see the cone as the main villain of the film.
A love story? 🤣 FAIL/PASS
Calsonic nissan skyline r32, castrol tom's supra, viper RST10, etc, where are those iconic beast?
Wow, I like it.
I can immediately tell this will be.. fine
I hope this movie has a funny yet exciting tone, mostly like Ford V Ferrari. I hope it's not overly dramatic like DTS which is basically played out by this point. Also, please have a scene making ironic fun of the GT license tests.
Imagine if they play Moon Over the Castle during the opening sequence. I’ll cry.
I'm praying for the appearence of the r34 pacecar, copen in coffe break, slr in mission 34 and toyota vitz as the ultimate reward at the end of the movie
Wooo in love with Sarah? ... Take a deep breath baby
They better have moon over the castle at the opening
This is gonna flip like Need For Speed, it will end up on the Hallmark Channel
You mean that this isn’t gonna be 2 hours of tweaking suspension settings on a 1990 Mazda RX-7? Pass.
"Exclusively in theatre" dam, guess I'm not watching it
*"Guys it's about love and drama"*   *Dom : So it's about Family?*
Uhhhhh ….. not much of a movie here boys. This is just sony showing off some cars and showcasing cameras and audio. BORING
Love to see cars that aren’t even in the game 😂
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
I'm team Forza but I don't get too caught up in the GT V Forza stuff cuz I just play the games so I'm excited to see it even though I've never played GT so it'll be different
This better be about the actual Gran Turismo world and the formation of the Gran Turismo Foundation from GT2 and not a shitty GT ESports movie.
worth a college try
As soon as they said "love story", I dropped all expectations.
I saw that mclaren when’s the release date
“ *Hey guys Super GT here showing you a racing movie this time* “
The fact that Niel Blomkamp (District 9) is directing this movie, these visuals and the cinematography is going to be mind blowing.
A movie based on the game??? YO
We need a ridge racer movie
To say I’m excited, is an understatement, I can’t find the right words. This game series has meant so much to me over the years. With so many memories of my Dad and I running endurance races.
There also needs to be a Forza movie as well
The vehicles in the movie need to be in the game
Even though I don't play GT anymore, as a Sim Racer I have to go see this. GT is what inspired me to become a sim racer, try for my SCCA license, and make a team. Hell, I wouldn't be a car guy if it wasn't for GT
As long as there is no damage I’m in.
As long term fan of the series I have high hopes of this
this LOOKS OUTSTANDING
If it doesn't have the Suzuki Escudo Pikes in it... forget it ....... haha ;)
I was interested until they mentioned the "love story" with a cringe kiss scene. Like just give us a story without the garbage.
Call me crazy but this might actually work...I'm intrigued
🏎️🏁📷
8 words: IMAX and Orlando Bloom is a convincing team manager.
So what live action video game movies are we getting next?: Jak and daxter Spyro or crash bandicoot cgi movie
So we had:  Uncharted live action movie  The last of us live action series on hbo  Need for speed live action movie  Street fighter live action movies Sonic the hedgehog live action movies  Tekken live action movie  Mortal kombat live action movies Resident evil live action movies Tomb raider live action movies  Rampage live action movie Gran turismo live action movie
Duno. My cringe detector is going off
Eww, why would you change the font?!  It's unsettling after 25 years of the same Gran Turismo font!
Looks more a film based on grid legends rather than GT sesries.
i'm not sure about the romance part
They should make a game out of this! /s
How can you make a movie based on a video game *AND* on a true story? Unless the video games were based on Jann Mardenborough's life... But I doubt it, the franchise debuted in 1997.
Hmm, the GT Academy movie, more like!! 😯😂🩲😀🤘
better not be a cash grab. better be good. don't be a ahole.
Will this be availiable for ps2?
This could end up either like Ford Vs Ferrari, or turn out bad. Hope it's the former
Next they will do a movie on FIFA. Ea will want some of this action 😂
Shame about the game
Foda pra caralho💪💪💪💪
Is this about the lad who won the PlayStation competition and got a seat in a real team?
Jejejejejeje una 💩 juego igual que la película
This romance plot scares me, We better see licence tests, taking 3 hours on a test which is just one corner
Yo if they're filming this like 1966s Gran Prix, the racing scenes will be next to none
Is the movie also going to have always online DRM and microtransactions?
Why needs there be a lovestory in it?
ooof i feel the cheese oozing from this one
Damn we really doing this. Hope for the best and looking forward to it.
do we need a love story in a movie based on a game that is actually based 10000% on cars?
Directed by Orlando Bloom?!?! If so I'll take a HARD PASS on this one!
How much do you want to bet the main character will have an Asian female love interest? If they don’t I’ll be surprised. Me love you long time!! Asian fetish racism! 🙄
I am the gran Turismo
Looks like someone has been watching the cutscenes from Grid Legends too much. I’m just disappointed it’s not 2 hours of fanboys whining their fave grind setup has been nerfed by the latest update
Shame Sony/PD didn’t spend more time making GT7 a decent game. Too busy making films now apparently.
Hmm a movie based on a racing game, I wonder if this will work, I’m gonna ask need for speed their thoughts.
LOL WHAT. GT is a driving game based on real driving...now it's a movie based on driving a game of driving in real life. Not sure I follow why it isn't just a movie about racing other than you know, publicity.
I know it's highly unlikely but it would be cool to see Super GT and a couple other well known streamers get a cameo appearance as opponents. Lol.
Is Kimi the villain?
Hopefully not yet another racing/car film where the essence of racing is just "floor the throttle pedal harder and put in another gear" scenes.
Translation: Please go to the cinema, you're killing us here
Will they also not be able to buy the cool cars just as in the game? Make them grind and grind and grind until they just have to throw more and more money at it. Only then it's a real gran turismo movie.
I hope the protagonist is at least a Japanese just like the game.
wtf
LOL
you gonna feel like you are in the middle of a shitshow with straightpipes dudes and love story with stage 5 bimbo b!tches hell yea lets promote bullsh%t wtf is rong with people
When does this game come out?
free game?
Nothing says "Sony executives" more than a love story in GT movie
Gran Turismo in cinemas is a massive event for gamers
My last Gran Turismo was 5 and the first Demo on PS4. Cant remember the name. Better be good.
Yeah this looks laaaaaame.  Hard pass.
Just no... This is not going to be good
I see Emelia Hartford!!!
A love story arc is not relevant to a movie about racing and racing game lol And  not having an Asian protagonist seems to be one last thing to be less related to the gaming title.  The only last hope will be they can at least cooperate some game music with nice driving shots or cars static shots
But... What's the point?
this Initial D live action looks p lit
It is going to flopp hard. Just don’t sink any money in it.
Hope my cinema has an online connection otherwise they can’t show it 😂
YO JIM HOPPERS!
This is where fast and furious should headed
Love story? F**k me..
Not sure if I like it from the footage, but you got Neil Blomkamp directing and the 2 Oscar nominated writers of American Sniper and King Richard? I'm optimistic
"love story" lmao aight this is gonna flop hard
Things this movie needs to be authentic: Dive bombs Chicane of Death  Tomahawk flyby  .5 track limit penalty  Momoz as the main villain
First, We had Ford v. Ferrari for Disney, Then, We had Lamborghini for Lionsgate, Now we have Gran Turismo for Sony and Ferrari at STX. What's next? A Forza movie? A NASCAR movie.
Man i Hope Not too much love and Cringe Shit i dont need that i Just need the Cars but okay i have Trust in neil
If they put that much detail and good taste as PD does, this is going to be amazing!
Was Not hyped at all for this but when i Heard that Neil Blomkamp is directomg this i was in everything this man is directing is great
Oh good it’s driven 2, no wait it’s days of thunder 2, wait wait it’s need for speed 2.  How many times can they make the same movie
My bet is that the movie is inspired by Jann Mardenborough's story 🤔
love story?you got to be kidding...
looks like some Michael bay shit .. love story ?lol
woooooooooooo
Hmmm... now this caught my attention. Orlando Bloom and David Harbour are big names, but how they're gonna transform a game like this in a movie? It's like making a FIFA movie. I don't know.  One thing's for certain, the racing scenes remind me so much of the Michel Vaillant movie, and I loved that movie!
imagine 60 minutes of the protagonist failing his gt4 IA-15 License 💀
This looks... like it's going to have pretty visuals with a very meh story I adore cars, I adore racing, but Gran Turismo is not a property that needs a movie... there's no plot in the actual games to warrant one
This better have an IMAX version and it better be good.
If this movie doesn´t have Soul on display in the climax, I will riot. They need to use great music, just like the game. I´m finally excited for a sony movie.
looks quite promising
0:38 there's a McLaren 720s. That car isn't in the game yet.  Where's my goddamn 720s GT3 Bruce?
Wow, it looks good Can’t wait for it.
Nani why love story?
Now I need Gran Turismo: The Movie the game.
This looks better than real life
Hmm, not sure if I want back to 24 fps ;) (But have fun with "dramas and lovestory")
im so glad we have npc's from the game itself in the comment section of this teaser
please with the music  "my favoriute game" as theme!
Antisipations will be high, more than likely 90% of the viewers won’t about the romance in this movie. We’re all here for the cars and race start count down.
to gravida ;-;
How cringe is this dialogue here to promote it. So generic.
Can’t wait to see this, they better have the license tests in this
The main character better end up with a platinum trophy at the end of the movie.
A love story.. 🤮🤮🤮🤮
I didn't see this coming. Literally at full speed. Nice!
A love story....................... FFS
I love the part where he said "It's Gran Turismo time!!"
Now downgrade the engine sounds to something close to a vacuum cleaner and we’re done.
It is look good
Is it PS5 exclusive?
Not enough explosions. Hire Michael Bay as the main director.
looks lame
Looks good
Neill Blomkamp going from District 9 to Demonic & now this?! Rise & fall.
That start up sound...
Ok but how long will it be 👀
I play gran turismo for 25 years you better make this at least as good as rush and make me cry im asking for it give me your best ..i love gran turismo dont break my heart
After this short Sneak Peek , it looks like we  are going to have an average movie again ,with teenagers behind the wheels , and really bad story like in Fast and Furious.After an excellent movie Ford vs Ferrari , every movie like this is going to be much worse , and thats for sure
It will be the first Movie to make 97 Million Credits out of the Box office
This movie going to be 5,3/10.
Where is Bugatti Chiron 300 plus?
When the actors have to come out and convince that this is going to me an awsome movie, it's not
楽しみすぎる！絶対見に行きます！！
"and its a love story"... Why?
It's definitely another movie about young talent who has to overcome everything to get the girl and win the world title.  Good to watch on streaming skipping all that cliché part and seeing if at least the races are good.  Will it at least have variety of tracks and weather??
I hope they understand the appeal of this movie for many will be the real action sequences, this is a movie that could really help capture the true motorsports experience
Ok never played the games since I have Xbox One, but I am very intrigued
se nel film il protagonista  non fallisce la pausa caffe 20 volte prima di prendere bronzo mi incazzo
Does it means that the Ligier Nissan DPi will be available on GT7??
This is awesome
YEAAAAAAAH 🔥
Where's Forza movie ?
I don't know what to expect... :/
No, this is Need for Speed Shift 2 Unleashead.
Another gaming IP ruined by w0ke bs! Stop it Sony, only a tiny loud minority cares about it. Focus on ENTERTAINMENT again!
first strand-type racing motion picture
Can't be more disappointing than the last game the bar is low on this one
0:34 No No No No No why this shit why!!?!?!
Fix the lag issue
Does anybody know how to wash jizz off pants? I need to know now.
just a pr puff piece, shame
Will there be jazz music?
Can't wait to see coffee break on the big screen!
So the story of the gamer who became a real driver? No thanks.
What a stunning movie, based on GT games.
Being a motorsport fan, this is really disappointing. There is literally no effort at all in the recreation of real race track. That heli shot at the beginning when you try to make it look like Le Mans by adding sponsors and podium, while being filmed at Budapest, is really bad looking. And this is just an example.
Film Spiderman 4 and the amazing Spider-Man 3
Horrible visuals. Was a director of photography even hired for this project?
Sony: We're sick of GT5 being the worst thing about GT Sony: Okay, we have a solution
Wait. True life story? Like what? This game have no story? The Story inside GT ACADEMY? Like alive hoon?
"It's a love story" Nah, no thanks...
Wtf!!! Did I just spot Kofun!?
Can't wait to watch a movie with no career mode.
Ofcourse it includes a love story. Kind of sceptical but that's just me probably
Epic🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol it’s based on a video game. Not a true story. Chill Orlando
Love story? Thats sucks
I’m imagining this being like Top Gun Maverick but with race cars, and that’s a compliment
4k 60fps?
I played GT:Sport for less than 10 hours but even I can't watch this trailer without tears of happiness and excitemenet
UO: need for speed movie feels more realistic than this one
If anyone gives the movie a negative review like they did in Need For Speed 2014, I'll never forgive them all for looking down on racing!!
pls dear g0d if gen z is involved do not let them talk
Looks like an extended Top Gear segment aka 'TV movie'.  Good luck with it.  Looks shit.
If Kazunori Yamauchi is not the man who owns & runs the cafe and talks the the main character about his personal collection of cars and it's "It's Okay to be scared it let's you know that you are still very much alive now drive forward and win tomorrow kid"  I will be very sad if this does not happen,
This movie will be stunning, look realistic, and have a dogshit story. Just like all the games that came before it.
I feel like this storylines in GT kinda reminds me of last year's Japanese movie, Alive Hoon
This Is Gonna Be A Very Awesome Movie Too👍👏🏁🏎🚗!!!
Finally, we've reached real life graphics!
What a perfect day to be a GT fan!!! 🤩
never saw this coming
Looked alright until they said there’s a teenage love story in there. Dumbest shit they could have done with this movie.
Well, i didn't ask for it, but i take it. GT is the best racing sim series ever, so...
yo y'all are using lmp2's and a 720s gt3 for the movie, we better get that in the game
Gran Turismo is a great game, I’m sure the movie will be good too. But is it really necessary for the Gran Turismo name to be on the movie? This could have been called anything.
I hope this movie will redeem Neil Blomkamp reputation
Kiss scene in GT is unnecessary.I want speed , drama and outsmart story.
В игре все гораздо сочнее...
XD
Think they're gonna include fictional tracks in this movie?
This looks incredible, I am so excited.  I grew up playing Gran Turismo on PS1 as a young boy
OMG!!! I SAW THEM RECORDING THE MOVIE AT THE DUBAI AUTODROME
Guys that's a Sony pictures Movie it's stunning
What about the daily race rammers, are they gonna be in the movie??
need for speed movie was alright but this? what? get out of here ford v ferrari. this is the definitive video game racing movie.
Will License Tests be in the movie?
Looks amazing! But we definitely need some of the classic JDMs from the used car dealership
So this is where all of the efforts to make GT7 content went, huh?  Please, less movies where dreams are made reality, more making the game we dream of a reality...   If GT7 had more content I wouldn't be complaining, but if you're putting more effort in a movie, instead of the main product (The game)...
How many license tests?
Why is this movie about Jann and not Lucas?
Vroooooooom!!
The cinematography is insane!!!🤯🤯🤯
why.
1.5 seconds penalty
Interested to see how this pans out, hopefully it will be good. The Uncharted and Ratchet and Clank movies were alright not great, not anywhere near as bad as video game to film conversions have been historically. Hopefully this will be better than the Uncharted and Ratchet and Clank movies.
Love story... CRINGE!
As a Gran Turismo fan myself, I will be watching this movie before my birthday! Cannot wait how David Harbor, the Red Guardian from Black Widow will race against each other. Guess it still fits for him tbh lol
I swear if Moon Over The Castle starts playing in the theatre--
Unxpected
Interesting, very interesting, i expected more a teaser/trailer but anyway, this looks so promising!
I don’t like the love story element in the story but I’ll give it a shot
There is no universe where this movie succeeds. Full stop.
Congrats! I knew that it was going to happen eventually since Sony is the parent company of Digital Polyphony. Been following Jann since GT Academy. Hopefully you guys can resurrect it and make it a reality show again. So much driving talent all over the world. Can't wait to fully experience the full emersion of driving in PSVR2 since I've been on a controller since 97!
So, Hungaroring in GT7 soon?
This short clip looks way better than the hole NfS movie.
And now we wait for a Forza movie to become a comedy because of it’s crappy servers, glitches, etc. And I’m a Forza fan saying this. Horizon 5 still has problems! I saw a damn raptor floating like it’s being abducted by aliens!
video game movies seem to fail sometimes
Exciting! ❤️
A romance? Was that really necessary
Louis Hamilton?
Hard pass
Favorite 0:14
👌👍
I’m hoping it’s good because after Elysium he has made terrible films
OK the love story turned me off by I will enjoy the racing scenes
Gran Turismo franchise has developed by Polyphony Digital.
I'm sorry, you lost me at "...it's a love story"  Fan since GT1....
No way! They're making a Gran Turismo movie?! Now this is what I call a movie
I’ve never played Gran Truismo, but this seems very promising! Think I’ll be seeing this in theaters
debe sonar the moon over the castle cuando liberen el trailer.. sería épicooooooo que genial
you lost me at romance plot 😠
Please Sony make a Fat Princess Movie! LMAO! 😂
リトル・マーメイドの実写版やピクサーのマイ・エレメントより期待できそう
I hope they include High Speed Ring as one of the races
I’m excited for this
Hey Need for Speed was a great movie, no reason this won't be, especially with NB directing. Sad that the Aliens sequel never got made though, that would've blew all our minds.
Of course the PlayStation logo is in this movie
I just want the racing scenes to look good and looks like it is.
Hopefully they rent real race cars, not the usual fake Hollywood crap. And I still think Forza Horizon will make better better movie. Racing through the map, kind of like Cannonball Run.
😂😂😂😂😂
They better have the main character taking his/her licenses test in the beginning of the movie.
Gran Turismo = from virtual to reality! 😁
SICKKKKKKK
Eh...idk. I'll watch it but playing the game is more exciting imo than watching a movie
Again, for the love of god no. I thought when I played GT7 it was missing a love story.
4dx this
Holy shit!!!!!
Fuk gt7 the game that keeps on steeling your money
Let's go!
That shot from behind the GTR looks EXACTLY like the chase cam in-game. I'm ALL for it baby! LETS FUCKING GO
This is fucken awsome. I love GT
Third playstation movie!
LOL NO, instant I heard Romance... Like that's supposed to be a "hook" for the story... Yeah no thanks I'll pass.
Finally a Gran Turismo with better graphics than Forza.
Whos here because they shared emeilas post and then had to find it to re-share to ppl 😂😅
Boring
I'm a massive fan of cars films and racing games, but I never would've thought in a million years they would make a film adaptation of Gran Turismo. I mean, we've already had one of Need For Speed in 2014, and that's one of my favourites.   If the Gran Turismo Movie proves to be worthy of a great film. It'll definitely be on the list of my personal favourite cars films.  I am going to see it in the cinemas and judging by some of the footage, it looks really good and even the car racing scenes look realistic.
Those Graphics so stunning just like a real life 🔥🔥
WTF?  Neill Blomkamp is directing this?  There are very few directors that will get my butt in a seat, let alone for a film based on a video game without a plot... but Neill is one of them.  I am absolutely here for this.
I played GT on PS1 for Days, best racing game of my childhood
The sound design looks very nice in this movie
Gonna be watching it regardless. I have high hopes and expectations!
Ive played some grand tourismo but I've never remembered having a romance in the game
Captured from PS5
You know what, you got my attention, if this movie is half as good as ford vs Ferrari, it will be awesome
PAL version when?
Please no WOKE crap.  Make it more fun than the Need for Speed movie.
Could this be cinema?
와
OOHHH MYYY GOOOD !!!🤩🤩
I can’t wait one of my favorites PlayStation Racing Games of all times so excited!!!
sorry but the cinematography is terrible
A love story? This isn’t Fast and Furious I wanna see the damn cars
As good as the need for speed movie. So not good.
Wtf! Why?!?
Anyone else spot @EmeliaHartford
Neill Blomkamp has returned 🙌
Holly Molly 💥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥💥
Cant wait for this movie to be like Gran Turismo 7 and have cars that cost the credits equivalent of 200 real-world dollars to unlock.  Fix the microtransaction, pay-to-win ridden mess that is Gran Turismo 7 first, then you can make a movie.
DAMN!🤩
now i want to play the game
Be more Ford v. Ferrari and less Need for Speed, please!!!
I hope they remember to get an oil change as soon as they get a new car.
Amazing!!! It's going to be a masterpiece.🔥⚡ I love cars and racing, and to feel that ambient is like to be in heaven.
Do I have to get all the licences to watch the movie?
No one asked for this
Gran Turismo looks better than Need For Speed!
ニール・ブロム・カンプ監督の最新作！
Can't wait to see Gran Turismo. Will it be in IMAX?
Have they announced this before, I never heard there was a movie in production till this teaser.
This could actually be great!
David Harbour! Orlando Bloom! Sign me up!
Is Neil Blomkamp gonna make people explode?
Oh god they’re gonna make a Forza movie next huh?
the immersion would be complete with D-box seats.....
If this doesn't have Daiki Kasho music it's gonna be a 0/10 from me.
😱
MEEEEOOOODEEXXXXDOOOCEEEUUUU
👍 Very Nice 👍
Looks amazing
My only concern is the romance plot. Will it feel shoehorned in or be just as compelling as that damn camera work. Holy shit
Neil Blomkamp isn't the writer this time  He's just directing
I am super flipping excited.
OMG That will be great
Amazing camera working
They're remaking the Clint Eastwood film already, it's not even that old
Cool!👍
Xbox player here. I really want to see it.
From DISTRICT 9 to this
The FPV shots look cool though
Holy Slag!.
This movie looks stunning I can’t wait to see it
I’m giddy. Let’s go! 💪🏻
Third person camera !!??
Present 5 minute
This is gonna be the final nail at the coffin of Neil Blomkamp's career
Looks promising
rápidos y furiosos 20
Is there gonna be micro transactions in this too
YOOOOO
This looks VERY fun and exciting!
Nah this looks FIREEEEEE
Why the heck is Sony making a GRAN TURISMO movie!?
Can’t wait I’m gonna try to see this opening day
Is gonna be adrenaline
Cars real life the movie
🌻☘️💐
😍😍😍
But
Im really excited for this
Let’s go
I love the game this is gonna be SICK
Its a shit
Frickin' awesome! This is where the fun begins!😸🥳🥳 still I played Gran Turismo 3 a lot times Back in the good old memories and Gran Turismo 4 was the most recent thingamajig i played a lot. I cannot wait to see that movie!🥳
I think this could be great
Can’t wait! Expecting District 10 next.
Never thought I’d see the day
When is ps5 slim coming out?
Ahhhh gritos de perra loca*
Dr. Pepper is just barbecued water
Can't wait
Grab trismbo
Nice
Outstanding
