Who is here after we signed varane, sancho and ronaldo?
Give it give it give it
Here after Cavani scoring goals one after another
Aaaand then it turned out to be one of our best signings in a long time😂
Looking at these comments now: 💀💀
Here to laugh at all the crying United fans that ever doubted my boy Cavani 🇺🇾
Who’s here after United are second in the league and Cavani is outperforming martial
We felt so disappointed that day because we wanted Sancho and got Cavani but as things calm down is good to see things in perspective. An elite poacher who is the only natural finisher alongside Mason
cavani worst signing possible, might aswell of got bale !
Cavani to United 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😛🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he is even worse then Patrick bamford
Big whop
Joke of  a club
I dont understand you lot. Cavani isnt my first choice, but he is quite a baller. His age makes him a little physically diminished, but he is very skilled. Still a terrible signing, but to put josh king over him? Horrendous lack of football knowledge.
👍
Oh yes, buy a old player who has long passed his prime instead of investing in a defender/s.
Utds transfer strategy is non existent..
Who tf wants Cavani thou really like come on wtf.
I support you cavani is not good for man united edwoord is destroying our team
There's still time Ed you can still back out

What news do u have about Pellistri comming to Utd, from Peñarol, Uruguay. Here journalists say that ManU will pay the €9.5M exit clause
This is the WORST  MANAGER IN OUR HISTORY👈
UNITED ARE FINISHED 🌾
Is he coming to replace Maguire at cb? That’s all good but we need someone else to partner him.
You lot are getting desperate now poor signing 10 year ago yes but now dear me
Lol 6-1
dont be shy, follow my Twitter @lewisihardman
1-6 Spurs i'm done
Relegation incoming
aye
Woodward has a hard on for 30 plus year olds. The most trash man doing transfers
Why does this Guy think so little of Igalo. I literally can not
Heard that utd were after lucas ocampos from Saville as a cheaper alternative to Jadon sancho
Beggars can’t be choosers I suppose
But the difference between him and falco is falco join with injury problem
Another "has been" purchased by Man Utd.  This transfer stinks of desperation to me.
Josh King would be a typical United move. Just like Alan Smith from a relegated Leeds
Clearly this is a desperate signing to appease the fans, but seriously, how stupid do they think we are?!
...
Cavan is to old and is Injury  prone 😬
Signings like this are why United are 3rd rate! It's  messed up! Fans should be throwing away tickets and chucking seats at the next game . A reported 200k for what ?
SANCHEZ 2.0 GROOUNDHOG DAY  ED WOODWARD THIS IS THE LAST ACT OF A DESPERATE MAN
What happened to United's transfer policy?
Oh poor
How can you not like Madzukic ? He is a brilliant striker. Come fresh pal.
Including agent fees and wages for the two years it will cost them 26.6m
Can you post a video of you praying Cavani works please?
He miss a lot of goal for psg
Cavani is rubish
20:10
Com on u red devil's 😈😈😈
Past his best don’t rate him
10m in agent fees for Cavani and penny pinching for Telles 🤦🏽‍♂️
Utd really are a laughing stock now and it's very sad to witness :((
THIS CLUB IS FOOOOOKED LITRALLY LAUGHABLE.. WE NEED HALF ARE EX PLAYERS TO BEG FOR MOVEMENT .
Ed Woodward is destroying Man Utd.
Don’t care where he played b4 we are joke as club
A lot of negativity here from United fans. We need Sancho to turn the mood around.🙏 Please Woodward...
FILLER
United got grand dad. MU i can get u my grandma on free transfer.
Who are the fans of Carrie Minati
You said Sancho was coming pal? Even went on the Kick off to confirm it 😂. So what happened then mark eh 🤷🏾‍♂️
Cavani was disrespected by psg and two seasons ago he was scoring 40 goals a season in a farmers league but if he can score half that in the prem it makes him no different to rashford, greenwood or martial who will never hit 30 goals a season
We have a lot of young strikers. Getting a player in with experience is a great idea. Someone for the others to learn from!
They sign Cavani to play CD!
I second that but given champions league football I think cavani has that experience
Conspiracy theorists would yell you someone up there is intent on destroying the club.
An upside to having a seasoned striker @ MUFC is his potential role as mentor to the younger strikers (Martial, Greenwood, Rashford). Cavani may only be a secondary option off the bench in games, but on the training ground he may impart some of his ruthlessness and skill to the younger players. Mentorship is vital, and MUFC is lacking that right now all over the field.
Ole isn’t doing the deals
What a fucking joke
Calm it down with the amount of adverts!!!!! Jesus..  20 adverts!!!! 20!!!???? Utterly ridiculous.
Waste of space! Get a Young player!
Glazers love the "big name" signings.....one problem, they are all past it!!!  Falcao, Schweinsteiger ring a bell
I like hum
Jeez look at that ad placement lol
I hope someone get's Ighalo. United was the dream for him, he picked up good training and games. Any Premier League team should offer to buy him,  it's the dream for him.
Hey Mark I think we need  to hang out n watch United games.. N discuss abt 5 year plan for our team. Hope we get Tellas n Sancho. OMG Cavani Tis is serious bad news. Hope we can get three points against Spurs..
United can have two directors of football and the result will be the same. At the end of the day, there are few idiots above them and yes they are the one who pull the plugs. There is only one way for us to move forward which is the change of ownership. I hope the UK football clubs can become like German clubs
Washed up mercenary.
Personally I think cavani is a good striker but I see what you mean
Cavani is an upgrade on Martial, Rashford.These guys throw away too many chances . it's not a desperate move a bit
L.Kuhn    jy non profit and 46
tbh we should have gone for the other 33year old uruguayian striker who WAS a free agent ,wouldve gotten us atleast 25goals
Needs more ads
You're so inconsistent!!!!! And don't expect Sancho to come

I’m so angry bro why are we signing a washed up striker instead of spending on sancho or dembele
Our first team should be Henderson, Bruno, VdB, Greenwood and 7 other players not yet at the club.
Absolutely Embarrassing... have we learned nothing??
The most ridiculous signing since our last ridiculous signing, Alexis Sanchez. The club is now officially a joke. Ole is clueless, the owners are clueless, we are doomed, it is so embarrassing.
What happens when greenwood rashford and co realise it's all bullshit and they cant win anything at utd , then it's really over
Don’t know why everyone’s moaning... would you rather pay this guys agent 10m and give him 250k a week... or pay Bournemouth £20m and josh king £150k on a 5 yr deal? I know which I prefer
'
Pretty much the only club who could afford him.Also with Cavani we can cross the ball in.
What about when we signed Zlatan?
Signing sancho will deteriorate Greenwood progress
We are playing liverpool  90th minute  0.0     4 chances on goal drop to = Ighalo  James Cavani   Who do you want to take those chances  ?
Still in the 90% club?
Time to change club....
Cavani is not the 1st option striker on this team so his work load will be less in terms of health & injury issues, we need to stay in 3rd or 4th when it's all said & done cause Sancho is not coming here if we're not in champions league, Martial be having few dull games during the season this is when Ole look down his bench as see there's quality to use Cavani.
Great weve signed brandon lees the crow .
Shambles FC, senior management couldn't run a sweet shop. Let's all get behind KG and the unfollow United campaign.
Just ask yourself would Klopp sign Cavani
Now this is a transfer I wanted to see.... 7 years ago
Media said, Man United seals Facundo deal. He will jet to England in Monday. If it's true, then it's clear, Man United bring Cavani not just for add a quality of attacking side. But, with all his experince he will be a good mentor for Greenwood and also Facundo.
I genuinely think a more capable person than Woodward,judge and co taking over a transfer will do far3 greater things even with the Glazers limited investment... I look at the academy recruitment and i question if its woodward incompetence or Glazers stingyness..cuz if glazers were stingy how can our academy recruitment be sooo good and we gonna spend potential 20million on two very good players a rw and cb i heard for the under 19
He is going to fail his medical .....
Cavani will be a hit for us. Mark my words.
Watch cavani get his £300k a week and the number 7 shirt
Plus a sign on fee for Cavani.
There is no sancho deal mark end that 90% club
Mark..you don't like Cavani...but think Martial is the perfect central striker???
I agree with everything he’s said apart from the tominay comment, plus igahlo has done a job so you can’t criticise him too much. The director of football is correct, it’s bollocks every year and I never expect anything to be honest. If anyone believes at this stage we even should get Jadon Sancho then you aren’t for the club. Fergie would never be held to ransom like we have.
Maybe the Bristol Uni trio pocket 5 million of the 10 million to Cavani's agent, side payments and all that! This is EXACTLY how Chynaa works by giving aid (high interest loans) to poor countries.
Wait a minute this isn't sancho
Disgrace
Ed Woodward jou ma se poes
If the glazers don’t want to sack Woodward they need to go for all I care
United dont learn,  you'd think after Falcao and Sanchez they would of learnt their lesson smh , ineptitude of the highest order in the transfer market.
Might as well bring back Ibrahimovic
Cavani is a definite upgrade on Ighalo, but giving him a 2 year deal at 200k a week is embarrassing for the club. Why not a 1 year rolling contract? We've had our pants pulled down  yet again. This Sancho deal is looking less likely by the hour, and I was in the 90% club.
Please ... don't support this!  Cavani is crap!  Waste of time!!!!!!!!
We should back cavani what options do we have? Don’t forget he could conceivably another zlatan
Gic
Feels like another Radamel Falcao kind of move.
Cavani in his prime wasn’t worth 200k per week.
Please Man Utd, sign Jadon Sancho, I'm begging you
The only way this works is United get Sancho, but they will need to offer more than what Dortmund want ??
It's a joke...sack the board!
Mark TO RUN THE MANCHESTER UNITED CLUB!!! HE WILL TAKE US TO THE TITLE
Oh my days why is he crying so much for?! Cavani off the bench is a different option. Yes hes not the player he was 5 years ago but 5 years ago he wouldnt be happy to be a backup. Being a free transfer aswell idc about his age. If everything goes to plan we should have Cavani and Greenwood as bench options and Ighalo and Dan James as emergency options.
We have another signing and he's a massive upgrade to ighalo....we were never signing Sancho or a CB and i for one wasn't expecting anything so this is a bonus
Utd are the new Everton
90% sure Lol😁
I hope he is going to be in the starting eleven
I I know what you mean Mark I feel the same although cavani has masses of experience which would be priceless for greenwood and martial
MUBC. Man united baseball club. We are finished. Get the clueless yanks out of the club.
Where’s ur sancho gone (where’s ur sanch gone) Where’s ur sancho gone (where’s ur sancho gone)
❤️
cavani has been poor too, just like ighalo, youre judging off of reputation, this is a stupid deal especially since SANCHO WAS  AND IS NOT COMING.
It's a striker to get us by for two years. Doesn't suit our teams style of play kind of injury prone. He has quality but there are numerous players out there that are better suited and he's only coming in because he's cheap.
i would be happy if we sign tellles on deadline and sancho on the january transfer window
Cavani is an experienced pro who will help our young squad out. It's not the worst signing we've made.
We must think positively. Eventhough he is 33+years old, but he has a lot of energy, stamina, skill and speed which is needed as a striker. Don't judge players by his age but  by his performance. I also agreed with Mark, that we still need Sancho and CB
Nice bro
Cavani could make an impact for only one year like larsson from Barcelona
We need a center back and a left wing player
Is rather have Josh king 🙃
Cavani is not a bad deal.Cavani alone is better than Martial and Ighalo put together.Mark is just disappointed because Man United did not sign Sancho yet.But that doesn't make him a bad signing..
Yes we need a director of football but you don't need to have a director of football to know this is garbage and completely illogical. Anyone excited by this needs their head read
They may have waited till the end of the transfer window in order to save wages. I don’t mind the signing at all
Get Rooney back...he knows the club
Great signing, relief pressure on Rashford greenwood martial, experience in champions league, give them all a experienced head to learn from. Ideal given situation.
Ten million euros for the agent as well as signing on fee for Cavani. Then his wages, put that towards sancho. These morons need to be forced out of our club!!!!! Enough is enough
Our front three is rashford, martial and greenwood. Cavani brings a wealth of experience, physical presence, and can bang in goals. Much better than igaloh. Look at Chelsea they just signed silva who is even older than cavani. You also complained that mata was too old and shouldn't have got a new contract... He's been one of our best players this season... All we need now is sancho, telles. Think bailly being fit this season could be our answer to a new centre back.... I don't think it's all doom and gloom.
Yet again left embarrassed by United's lack of movement in the transfer market. Its impossible for United to sign the players they need early in the window. Being run like a Micky Mouse club!!
This would be a good luxury signing if we had brought in a RW a CB and LB in addition to VDB and then got an experienced striker on top. but this is not acceptable when we got desperate priorities not filled first
What time does the window close tomorrow?
Why didn’t we just resign Rooney club legend
We might as well sign zaha and depay instead and hope for the best. As we have buyback clauses on both players. This club is a joke!!
United should of grabbed Suarez when he was a available. Yet they settle for cavani
BHAISAHAB telles k baare mein toh bhool he gye..woodward uske liye bhi 5 million he de rha hoga xD
I hope we don’t get him old,injury prone,huge wages and agent fees BAD DEAL
We hv a dreadful horrible backline, yet still scrapping out for attacking players. I just don't understand where this club is heading. SMH🤦‍♂  cavani??? Really??? Troy deeney would do a much better job than cavani. F**@ng stupidity 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Look at lfc chelsea
The fucking 10Million agent fee.If we have 10 million, why don't we put it in the Sancho fund??
These Agent fees are likely kickbacks??
His same as ibrahimovic
Cavani better than sancho
another sanchez
"Maybe, we can't deal with Real Madrid?" I am cracking myself. Man, we can't deal with anybody :).
I hope united fans know its not solskjaers fault, he never wanted cavani..... He could be good but the manager has been thrun under the bus, I expect him to be sacked this year..... If they won't back him it sounds like mourinho all over again.... Won't back him...... Sick of these owners, makes ya feel so left down with this transfer window
Lol cavani is past it
Ole singing Papa Roach after Cavani comes in "Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort!"
We do need a decent striker  17- 20 prem goals a season isn’t good enough from what we have  If he scores all good but it’s still embarrassing
I’m done, I can’t with this club anymore. WE WENT FROM SANCHO to this!!? We are a joke why did we keep ighalo? why are we focusing on A STRIKER WHEN OUR DEFENSE IS HORRID
Paying the agent = paying the player.
You seem to have given in, resigned to accept how things have become. Could have had Haaland, but no.  Why sign Sancho when you could have Cavani? A bargain is a bargain is a bargain, eh Ed?
What happend to Luca jovic??
It just sounds like an Adidas shirt sale deal.
mark is so dumb. Cavani he played for Uruguay so what? Ighalo plays for Nigeria. what are you trying to sell. you are probably working for the glaziers all of a sudden you are so chilled about what is supposed to be a blunder of a transfer window.
Sancho deal 100% dead ... confirmed
What a joke sack the board!
You
I can see us signing Cavani as a stop gap so that we can sign Haaland in the next couple of years.
We all fans were frustrated. After Cavani Signing, almost half the fans - We are happy with Cavani.. This is why Utd's boards are still there. This is what we as fans have to learn. Accept new signings but be stict to what we want.
Mark, if they don’t sign Sancho, I’m voting with my pocket beginning immediately canceling my United TV and not buying any more Man United merchandise until they win premier league. I’m urging all Man United fans to speak out with their pockets. I’m not going to subsidize glazers anymore.
Wayne Rooney rn>Cavani. Im boutta cry
Thomas Edison Galbani 😂😂😂😂 wheres Sancho, wheres Demebele
I'm not defending the board but knowing them, this could've been part of the plan but they didn't want to pay his 200k a week for months before the window closed
JADON IS STILL ON.. U LOT NEED TO RELAX AND SMILE MORE
THIS IS MOANCHESTER UNITED.. FIX UP!!!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YO MAN STOP MOANING  HE SCORES GOALS
You need defenders mate not forwards.
There should be no agent fees its not like there are clubs fighting for him that we need to pay the agent to bring his client to us wtf united
Ladies and gentlemen, the end of man United. We should all buy Leeds merch to protest!
Still obsessed with Jadon Sancho! 🤦🏽‍♂️ Someone give this guy Jadon Sancho already!
Igalo's performance had deteriated that much in decline that we had to buy a 33.5  year old seasoned striker that is injury prone.... This boards a joke and Matt Judge/Ed Woodward are shite negotiaters
Why does a manager want something, u refused to back him then give him what u think is better, then sack him for failing due2 your own choices. Sounds funny.
Cavani aint coming
I kno cavani wil kam with sme bit of leadership to United n I kno he wil work
Yeahhhhh.. I like Cavani...here we go 20 to 30 goals per season
He has the same speed of Kane so why not
20:10 WTF
Just get to the point
You should football of Director of Man utd
Our club is in serious trouble, and I'm sure we won't be in the top 4 next season, so fucking sad
20 ads....
Big name cavani but not effective
Cavani without Sancho be like Falcao 2.0. No long term vision, no passion & once again they don't mean business at all...
🤣🤣🤣 hilarious signing again not what null & void need
It is better to not sign anyone than to sign Cavani. It will just deny opportunities for young players. It is not like Cavani is going to win us title this year.
lol someone have agreed to share millions with the agent 🤣 Evra was right.
So many breaks
Cavani?!?! We're finished 🤦🏾
Praying they don't give him the no.7, that would mean the end of any other deal for a certain winger 😫
Calculate Dembele's price & salary (plus the injury record) and add that to Cavani's (old sick horse) salary. Now look at Sancho's price and salary. which would you prefer in the long run? Woodward cannot figure that out
CAVANI COULD JUST BE AS GOOD AS IBRA
🙈🙉🙈🙈🙈 i don't want to see this madness of a transfere anymore 😔
Telles for 15mil , Cavani agent 10mil.    Ed: Yes!! I'm saving 5mil for Glazers. They are gonna pay me my cut.  🤦🤦  Such a joke this club has become. Never thought MUFC would come to this.
Worst deal ever
Cavani and igalo ..perfect striking partners😂😂😂😂😂😂one from holololo planet ..other from lu Chan chin
I hear a Brazilian (Pele) is available,  maybe we should him since we prefer oldies...
Mark pls stop swearing i would appreciate it thank you
Dnt knw ur knowledge in ftball man...bt Cavani is mille better than Martial n Ighalo n real world class!! Nw abt age issue??? Ibrahimovic...too was old bt he impress...
This deal is an insult to the fans. It stinks of desperation.
What a sign🤭🤭🤭🤫🤫🤮. I have nothing to say. I give up now for Manchester United. I don't like to watch without Sancho 😞😞😟🤬👿
I really want CAVANI.  .....
Wtf wtf wtf wtf wtf
Dont worry too much. Last time sir alex also did the transfer panic. Remember Hendrick Larsson
We need a CB a LB and a RW but we gone with a 80 year old grandpa who used to play CF.
Cavani is that bad?
100% a signing of desperation, we are going backwards faster than most of us want to admit. This board, these owners have to go.
Dude chill. 20 ads ??
Face it, Cavani is the striker that your 'transfer genius' at Man United decided would save your season.  Sancho ain't walking through that door!!
You'd be surprised to find out  how many players want to come to United to get a fat final paycheck.
inghalo get 100k ..and he will take 150
Mark don't get so depressed. View it as a swap deal with Alexis Sanchez., and add to it a net saving of £200 K per week on Sanchez' wages. Is it really so bad?
of course cavani far better than ighalo, but talking about united vision, this is a joke.. we don't even can pay telles... stupid woodward and team
If we get Sancho and Telles to add to Donny and Cavani then it looks a good window but in truth these deals should of been done from first day of the transfer window and been completed before the season started,
Why can’t we just pay halands release clause in Jan
Oooooh get over it Mark. Sancho is NOT coming. And it is a lie that he was offered to all other clubs. PSG wanted him to stay.
We need to start spamming all the sponsors and let them know that we won't buy any of their products as long as they sponsor the club.
I’m just excited for facundo pellistri
I think Man Utd will sign Ousmanne Dembele in the last hours..!! 😢
Di Maria vs ex Man.United...  Cavani vs ex PSG   😉
I wish you could become our sporting director
The pace of the Prem' will deal with Cavani.
Its a Laurent Blanc
How on earth can cavani even couch the youngens when he cant speak a single sentence of english
Cavani needs to do well to save the Board's butt.
He is a good striker and  our young attackers will learn a lot from him but to me it seems like a conspiracy because two months ago it was remoured that the club was interested in Cavani . Now all of a sudden the champions league group draw is complete and low and behold we are in a group with PSG . So who is seeking an agenda cavani himself or manu trying to manipulate a situation ? I wonder ?
why he hate josh king
I never had total confidence in Sir Alex’s transfer choices, but it didn’t matter because he could win with almost anyone.
I don't even know no more..
For the first 30 minutes of this video Mark your going round and round in circles talking about the same thing!
Can't compare him to Zlatan who scored 50 goals in his last season for PSG.
Hes gonna bring some experience and leadership who will help with the young forwards. Kind of like Ibra did
If Sancho doesn't come, for sure gonna stop watching football for a while
I’d be more excited if we got rid of deadwood at this point. Sancho deal is dead, Cavani is way better than Ighalo. Ighalo is worse on his feet than Lukaku was
Please see the Leeds documentary and learn how a director of football is so important. Even Daniel Levy is better than Ed Woodward.
it is all business non of football. A short term stop gap hoping to make as much they can  from  merchandise sales..if he produces in the filed awsome BUT it does not help with rebuilding of the wounded status of the club  more like replenishing their coffers that has leaked thru a big hole in 2020....Sanchez 2.0???
Hmm. I wnt sancho. Desperately
Like the old saying "what goes up must come down" we're all witnessing the downfall of one of the biggest football club in the world.
We could have got Suarez... for that instead of Cavani ... 😥
erm... Falcao went to Monaco and could not stop scoring. Some real top drawer goals.  It was Van Gall that stopped Falcao. He would have Aguero on about 8 goals a year.
Potch to Man City before the season is over.
Come on guys, cavani is a proven goal scorer with bags of experience at the highest level. Look at rashford and martial, some days they are good and some days they are nowhere to be seen. cavani has a high work-rate and his experience is going to help the young team. mason's coming through but is only 19. We are in champions league this year, experienced players are going to help. Look at van de beek, low-profile player but has more experience in UCL than most man utd players. Come on GGMU !!
Tottenham signed a 25 year old Brazilian striker who was the top scorer in Portugal, as a backup. Meanwhile here we have someone nobody wanted during the whole window.
Back to their best ... the Board is returning to their old ways ...
el matador better aim his sniper at ed :P
Fuzk off, glazers & Woodward OUT OUT, it was stupid deal signs Canvani. We need the power forwarder, he is incapable with nothing of skill,
Captain Obvious here..... we need a director of football. Let’s just welcome Cavani and get on with it. What else can we do. Same ol same ol.
Old man 😅😅😅
cavani miles more iconic than falcao man
No can be like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, still performing so well. They should have bought him back. Still better than Cavani.
I don’t mind Cavani. Buys Greenwood sometime time to develop into a world class striker.
They’re only signing cavani because they dont want to get embarrassed in the champions league.
Sorry but he is a bad signing not because of the quality but because a club like United has to get players for the short term and for the future.
Spiralling down n down
dont mind this signing. its adds experience and depth to the squad. you need depth to be successful ie ole/teddy/yorke/cole, berg/stam/johnsen/may etc. I do get that it may not be a priority area or signing but I see it as adding depth in a positive way. other areas are a wip...work in progress
Some people see Cavani is a top player 🤨
Cavani will get injured in the first few games and back in the second season!... this is totally pathetic, disgusting, totally incompetent....why we let Lukaku go and go for Cavani?
My name is Mike Thompson
One is better than zero, let's cavani join insteadof a fractured man utd board
Man U on course for CL Title this season. Congratulation, well done, the best deal of the century, Man U beaten all  the top clubs for his signature. Can't complain really, Blimey.
A target man, but not going to score many because it's the midfield and fullbacks that United are lacking creativity
whyyyyyy
what ppl seem to be forgetting is ibrahimovic is 39 and still banging them in for ac milan so if he can do it anyone can
Goldbridge has to talk to his sources............the guy at his local fish and chip shop
Falcao didnt work veron didnt work it wont work we need another world class winger sancho or dembelle will do martial makes a solid 9 rashford can play as a 9
20 ads now yeah?? I honestly respect your grind lads but that is a proper overkill lmao😂😂
My god. Watching this chanel during non-live is getting hard these days. Just this video alone there are 20 over commmercials
Soooo... Who's going to get him the ball?
33yo...im with you on this one mark...desperate....but still need to replace lindeloff.
wow...!! what a signing ,  just the club project is 5 years behind...!!
Wow I get the feeling Goldbridge dosen't like Cavani much LOL
Old is gold I still remember teddy sheringam and ibramovich ❤️🇲🇺 ggmu
What’s up with Martial now?
Ok now cavani vs psg in CL like dimaria vs man utd.
🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰🔫🔫🔫
Omg ur not getting sancho after this cavani deal! Why can’t this guy accept United aren’t getting sancho hahaha
When we are doing to buy a player like cr7 that was the man u i know
Typical United desparate move, bound to fair , I doubt Ole ever wanted this.
mark...mark...mark..wth is going on at utd mate?
tbf, PSG star CF,  aging, on a free transfer, Zlatan 2.0 hopefully🙏🏽🙏🏽
He will revitalise the attack. He is a good signing.   Sancho is not gonna come. Lets accept that.   Ole need to get the right formation n positioning.  GGMU 💪❤
What a joke
Its a risk but hes a proven goalscorer and it only a 2 year deal
Come on mark, why we have to follow Dortmund 🤡
Ya know, all that really matters is the fact that Arsenal are probably gonna finish above us...I'm gonna lose a case of beer to my bro...bullshit
Definitely this club is Joke I’m done for support United peace up 🤬🤬🤬🤬hello Liverpool 🤘🏻
Cavani is top level player who gives 100% for whole match. Will raise level of whole team
OMG...😱
We can do things in this transfer window which no one else can - Ed Woodward   Fucking right we can do which no one else can sign cavani for 250 plus quid when the rest of the world didn’t want him
Athleticism Madrid wanted him get your facts right
Cavani deal means we will finish either 6th or 8th we have gone backwards where at least 6 teams have strengthened and are now better than ours
This is a disgrace because what is going on here SANCHO is what we need not a 40 year old striker
*Remember when you laughed at Ighalo signing and he played decently well*
You are too negative mate he is a short term option so they can get a good player in because not many strikers are available. Or maybe you want josh king then?
I think you dishonor Igahlo he has played well when he had had time on the pitch. His recent opportunities have been limited.
We should get Khoulibaly and a lower end replacement for the Sancho failure
Video was funny as hell
It Sun today n 2 mrow is last date of the transfer dealine. Where is Sancho n Tellas??. I can see spurs is give us hard time..
Mark got progressively angrier as the video went
Ed woodward and glazer try to play(game)with us by cavani because of sancho..but we want still sancho,if you cant buy sancho then get out from the club
Un desperandom my dear
Dudes absolutely ripped Josh King to shreds lmao
Desperation here we come,Go united
Woodward should do a crowdfunding for Sancho and Telles. I bet they can raise £100 million
I just remember the kid saying , Which is your favorite Man United players and the kid replies none of them,all are rubbish.
This isn't with Sancho, he's the Sancho alternative
Ole: I want Haaland. Gets Ighalo. Ole: I want Sancho. Gets Cavani.
Get Telles and Sancho. I’d be very happy
doesn't care what you think
Instant deadwood
He needs many many chances to score. I'm gutted by this
This is the bad old days of signings. Don't want him.  Rather have a Josh king. At least ogaglo was desperate to be here.
48 more hours of depression.... Cava who??!
I can't think of anything positive about this deal!
Here we go from Romano.
Literally anyone, and I mean anyone could go into United and be in charge of transfers and do a better job than these idiots!! The level of pure incompetence is unbelievable! Literally speechless as to how appalling this club is run!
I think cavani is a quality player, hes one of those players that would score many goals and can change everyones opinion
My Grandma is turned on by this signing!.....she's 86.
How long will this carry on for? Ed Woodward and the Glazers really think we got mugs written on our heads,   We needed proper signings to build our squad this transfer window but yet we signed van der beek who ole hardly picks and Cavani who will hardly play, we need to sort out our defence and DM position them think about sorting out the winger position, we talk about who we buying but the guys who are running the club can’t even get rid of deadwood.
20:10
😂😂😂😂 what a freaking joke.
For me whether its desperate signing or not I dont give a f**ck as long as lazy,mody tony won't be starting as our striker
WTF PANIC ON THE STREETS OF MANCHESTER 🇾🇪✌️
Well cavani gonna sell more shirts than josh king
We should have had Haaland in the bag last January. Not Cavani now. Where is our pacy CB that we so obviously need? Sancho deal should have bn completed 6weeks ago. The window has bn a disaster. People who say Cavani is better than Ighalo are missing the point. We should be aiming to bring in someone who is better or at least on a par with Martial
Nobody to u @goldbridge like @sancho
Tarzan
Reeks of falcao
Cavani is better than Bale? Wth
'arseholes like bunnies nose' hahahahaahahahaha
Woodward needs a Medical now!
Can I be Cavani’s next agent please. €10mill for sending a text sounds like a dream job
We're stupid who wants to come here - well said -True!
Even I'm not really angry . But I do think if we get sancho I will let this slide
and now sancho + Cavani is enough? Lol Mark they need at least 4 in and 7 out. Cavani + Sancho is still an absolute joke of a transfer window and now that is the thing that will make you happy? how the bar has been lowered...........
We need that forward for depth mark even though other positions are more needed I wish him well at my club
D.E.S.P. , spot on Mark
The amount of ads on your videos is worst mate honestly
Carvani ? I would rather sign Jamie Vardy im serious.
Cavani will be useful for sharing experience with young striker and make them better n better.  That is the plan 😅😅😂🤣🤣😂
I don't have a problem with Cavani he is Class! But we must get Sancho!
There’s no way United get rid of Smalling for £27m, Pereira for £27m and Dalot on loan and just sign Donny van de Beek. I just have this feeling that Sancho and Alex Telles would sign because it was said a couple weeks ago that it would be two in two out. But it could three in three out Smalling, Pereira and Dalot gone. Sancho, Telles and Cavani in.
Will cavani be in for the spurs game?
Love mark, but when he puts martial on the bench he’s going to lose it! Martial goes to the bench before rashford...trust me
Name the 400
Cavani's greedy brother is probably so happy he just won a euromillions jackpot paycheck...😑 Smh
Heard united signing anyone above 30 to sit on the bench, anyone knows where to sign up?  i come cheap 5k pounds a week and im happy.
I hope it doesn't turn into another Sanchez situation under Mourinho, where Martial was benched for Sanchez even though he was playing quite well. I don't know how well Martial reacts to getting shifted back to the left wing for Cavani. Will Cavani want to sit on the bench ? He is not coming here for such high wages to just sit on the bench. I hope Cavani doesn't fight with Fernandes for taking penalties.
United - The Church of Later Day Saints
Cavani is upgrade to ighalo so I’m not goin to be bitter about this transfer I just wish they had get Alex telles if they not getting sancho
Did you talk about comparison cavani to ighalo? Bruhhh, as a number 9 i can say cavani still better than martial
Lol being part of the United Board must be the easiest job, you can time and time screw up consistently and hit get replaced.
Mark please, drop Sancho. He told me MU couldn't afford to buy him. Calm down and watch your blood pressure.
It reminds me of the zlatan deal a few years ago
He’s been available for 8 months. Why did we only think he’s good enough 48 hours before the window closes? Why didn’t we sign him months ago instead we extended Ighalo’s contract? It’s almost like we didn’t want him and we’re desperate.
That will be our window
Hey man, very true cavani is better than ighalo , but the fact that you kept saying it repeatedly is just annoying and unfair cus ighalo isn't even in the first team , he is always on the bench or brought in at the very last minute there's really little you when you're not in the game you know haha.
The way you guys says that without Sancho Man United are doom. All the blame going about the board  this season if Man U don't do well. No one will  blame the manager . Hahahaha
Crazy how some people are defending this signing how United have fallen! Embarrassing
Everyone say Liverpool buy Ven Dijk and Allison that why they win the title. Some way it true. But see what has Kloop improve the team. The defenders , midfielders and strikers becomes world class player.
Is it loan or transfer
He is gonna play drum this time. He doesn’t suit playing piano.
20:10
Falcao deja vu all over again..cant get priority signings so simply rush to get a big name but useless short term signing.... they have no clue what they are doing
why so much hate before he even kicked a ball? people didnt want james and he is shining for everton now....
Mark is on the boards payroll 100%
Was actually okay with the signing until Mark mentioned how we all felt about Bale. Didn't want Bale but would rather Bale than Cavani. If we don't get Sancho it's going to be hard to watch this season.
You could not be that incompetent I can only assume that  cfc and lfc and mcfc are paying the glazers and ed deadwood to run the club into the ground
So Cavani will score the winning  goal against PSG and take Man united to last 16 😁
Cavani wages are Jaw Dropping 😂😭😈
Bartering over telles for 3m... but then will fork out 10m on agent fees.. cmon now stop mugging us off
I Agree He isn’t a really good signing. But stopp calling the French League crap please
Darn, looks like we might have another year of Sancho in again off again videos.
Mr. Negatives, I can never really finish watching him. So Negative and if this is A REAL MANCHESTER UNITED fans channel. I will never be a part of this. Win, We moan, Lose We Moan. Seem getting more near to Arsenal fans channel instead of Man United fans channel and forget about the REAL fans stuffs. I seems always to see Man Utd fans enjoying themselves after a win but it always whining & moaning. When you see him talk something Postives, it always become negative the next instant.
I think the plan is .... moving Martial to the wing and playing Cavani as a striker since Sancho is not happening. Laughing stock United !!
Would Liverpool, City or Chelsea make this signing.
Feels like Woodward has just turned round and said let them have cake, disgraceful and disrespectful any other business ran in this manner would of gone bust years ago it only keeps going because we love them so much!
Ole wanted a young erling Hartland and ed deadwood decides to sign cavanie and pays an agent fee that would seal the telles deal for a player that is a free agent lost for words club will be in the championship within a few seasons with these clowns at the helm
Ole wanted a young erling Hartland and ed deadwood decides to sign cavanie and pays an agent fee that would seal the telles deal for a player that is a free agent lost for words club will be in the championship within a few seasons with these clowns at the helm
Unfollowed United Everywhere
We are not signing Sancho mate
Bruno and Cavani to fight for the penalty 😅😅
400 strikers better then ighalo and that includes flex straight up !!!!!!
Totally get the Cavani concerns but i think you can also look at it like a Thiago deal that Chelsea have sone for the same reasons. Experience. We had a Cavani against Sevilla and we would have won that
He's free to go why ain't all the big clubs trying to get his signature. But we will united are a joke club fact
Am not old enough to know success at this club and since fergie left i have never one day trust my club
So this is what it’s come to for this club. Yikes, just yikes man
Mark, if you are a better player than  Ighalo, why aren't you in China earning 400k per week like Ighalo, instead of 500 pounds a week to run your hateful lips on Youtube?
Man utd is spending like a Chinese football club
Low risk attempt to appease the fans if Sancho doesn’t happen
"Cavani is better than Igahlo "really ?
The club is finished
I think Woodward is once again trying to find another excuse and this time it's about when spectators/fans would be allowed back in the stadium because of the pandemic and millions of dollars are lost each game so he doesn't want to spend much on tranfers, funny enough Ole will get the bad end of all this
"I will allow this deal" wow, his ego is incredible,, does he think they need his permission???
Mark in three months when Cavani scores a wonder goal “sit down....Cavani....get in” 😂😂😂
United now no future players no future
I hope he fails the medical
We are just a joke club now we are getting worse every transfer window
So Goldbridge called for Mourinho to be sacked after finishing 2nd and then crap results after a crap transfer period but now says it’s wrong for Ole to be sacked after finishing 4th and a potential crap transfer period?
Ole “What happened to my 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th choice?”  Ed  “he was cheap”
Honestly, I'm just surprised we got past "personal terms agreed" for once
I'm happy we get him. He will help Martial and Greenwood develop. Also Ighalo will be gone in january and if any of our strikers get injured, Cavani could be a starter. He could even be a starter now, I think he's still a slightly better striker than Martial
We will see how he does in the premier league
I'm taking a break from football really be fuckong wid my mental health
Another Sanchez deal
another injury prone pensioner who has never played in the PL incompetent
If we don’t get Sancho tomorrow! We not getting him
I will chase any one who I see in a cavani jersey(Utd)
Mark speaks three words:  Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad... if we get Jadon Sancho Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad Ad.
I'm gonna commit suicide
This is the end of Sancho
If cavani is a good signing we should try and get Paolo Maldini to as a cb.
We had all the time in the world to make great signings in priority areas but then we wait for the last minute to sign retired players in positions we do not need at a premium price.
Willian to Arsenal  Cavani to Manchester United  Gabriel to Arsenal  Van de beek to Manchester United
20+ adverts sadly cheapens the channel for the viewer kerching!
We would pay 25 million for king plus at least another 15 million in wages I'd rather pay cavani 20 million than king for 40 million
I cant listen to this guy anymore honestly what a load of bollocks he talks.
90%
This is shocking. Yet again another 97 year old superstar.
Am more disappointed in man u Than my school results
Ole doesn’t have pulling power to sign any elite or up and coming talent  that’s also a reason why they can’t sign who they want
I cant understand why we are not getting telles. 18m pounds are not that expansive. Also why arent we trying for callejon then? He has been a great winger in Napoli and currently he is free agent.
Clubs a joke still waiting for refund of season ticket from last year, always a red but not feeding the beast anymore. The signings are embarrassing I ain’t paying for cavanis medical bills.
Mate barca pay about 600million on wages how about that plus all thoese shady brazil deals
Why is everyone negative in this channel? Give the man a chance
We're supposed to trust the process! 🤔
34 years in 5 months... might fail his medical due to arthritis
James is on 🔥
Manchester United Business Club
The fact this guy thinks cavani is joining to be a bench warmer is mad
i liked this but i dont.
United business strategy: wait till the last minite and wing it.
Mightn't be too bad..... even a broken clock is right twice a day. .. surely one of these crazy signings has to work.
Give up on Sancho, you might get Albright
Back to retirement fc
confirmed if you want Mark to drink green tea put it in a Man United shirt
Ole is a spineless coward as he kept defending useless people in United. He’s an other form of cancer in the club. Believe me, United not gonna win any games in October because of Ole.
Will people now finally accept they're not signing Sancho
Boring!!! Cavani is old
Cavani? Have they lost their mind?
Atleast we will a reliable striker....
We are finished
Prime Cavani is better than prime martial. Please put some respect on his name
I seen a bird the other day trying to fly without a right wing made me sad reminded me of Manchester United and Sancho then it got run over by a truck.
Psg cast off... We're fucking Utd!!!...How far have we dropped.   This isn't my Utd anymore...
This guy is still talking about Sancho lmfao
No Sancho then as Martial will be moved back to left wing and Rashford move to right wing.
What united need to do is get Sancho deal over the line then if we get the telleas deal and cavani deal over the line it's a decent transfer window not our best  but theres a stronger bench expect Sancho who would walk into any team and I would like to see Dan James play more on the left than right if rashford ain't performing
Absolute fucking piss take
Yeah and why not, he’s an established and proven #9 though approaching the end of his career and try tellin Zlatan that, these older guys still think they hav something to prove so let’s see
please stop it with this looking frwd getting young hungry players for long term plan! It never works now unless they all come at once together like fergie had or Busby! Rashford was one it's now his 5th season James another! wan  bassaka sott mct! Martial was another only 19 ! Linguarde was promising now 28! Problem with long term plan is the young players end up  getting old b4 the plan comes to fruition! And you need time which you dont get now and a really good manager!
We're a has been. Its just brutally honest. Signing has been players to a has been club with a broken Mentality  Sad now to be honest. Not mad, not angry at all I'm sad. probably good for me to stop seeing United News for a while after transfer window, need a little break ( not kidding genuinely do i don't feel good supporting the club anymore ) need to look Back at why i started supporting the club in the first place, maybe
So United are building a future with hasbeens??? I totally agree with Mark since I also don't like Cavani and also not Green Tea! He's arrogant and don't have the skills anymore to get away with it.
mark in all seriousness this is like mourinho's last season at our club he only got fred n grant that last transfer window n now if we dont get sancho ole will only get van de beek and cavani...... the two sets of signing are alarmingly similar.
Tonight’s prayer before bed: Dear lord, please don’t let this be the second coming of Radamel Falcao, Amen.
This is how the league is going to goEverton,  Liverpool, Manchester city and Manchester United and Leicester city
Banter club hahaha
Get in Jeremie Boga, he's the best right winger out there.
We could be taken Suarez instead
Cavani er such an amazing player, but I think that i bring a lot of good mentality with him
Would someone explain why we obsess over transfer fees & don’t give A FUCKING RATS ASS about overpaying on weekly wages?
United need to make deals and quick sancho ASAP
All i can say is that this board is the worst!
Bring back Micheal Owen
You know whats happened, United have seen Liverpool buy a 29 year old, Chelsea buys a 36 year old, Spurs loan a 31 year old so they think older players are a good option...........
Nothing wrong with this signing. Adds another dimension for the attack
Remember we were getting linked with Dembele and Latauro Martinez in July? This is what we ended up with.
Mark I am speechless
This transfer goes against everything that Olli is trying to do! Young good talent to old as Yoda striker
Marks a bit of a bitter bugger isn't he??  Just dismissing other peoples opinions because he's angry !! Pony up mate ffs !!
he wants the big Latin America market!
MARK if your saying you were totally blind sided and didnt know a thing about Cavani! Then maybe your not quite  in the know with the information you get  so maybe you should lower your 90%
$10mil agent fees? the question is how many games will he play ... its very sad that agents can make more than most PL players, the irony is that they (Man Utd) was complaining about BVB agents wanting to much but its OK to throw $10mil to Cavani's agent who negotiated a free transfer
Should we not of just kept big Rom if we wanted a target man 9?
@mark  this cracked me up.... "imagine we got dembele and cavani? What would they do... compare injury records" hahahaahaha😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Really hope he doesn’t turn out to be another Falcao
Or to put it another way, if we were still aiming to get Sancho in this window there’s no way we’d be getting Cavani
Sancho does not want to go to us fact. He wants to plat proper football not the shite urd play lately no plan a nor b
Yea it did
Not another Falcao
Can’t believe anyone is still thinking Sancho is still possible.  Cavani has played centre and either flank so that’s our right sided attacking signing.
The sad part is that Cavani will actualy bench our current offensive squad. I was hoping for Jovic.
Cavani desperately wanted our fabled number 7, but we're giving him 70 since he's a pensioner.
Id take Adama traore for 40-50 mill + James
Imagine if they give him 7.....
Great signing, defence last season was on a par with City and liverpool but miles behind re: goals, Cavani might be the difference.  GET BEHIND THE CLUB
Mark gonna pay cavanis  wage with the amount of ads he puts on his videos lately
here we go!! football fans know so little about the sport that they support and are so over emotional they can't even see straight to see they are chatting nonsense... Easity manipulated, all we hear about is transfers and glazers it's ridiculous just be happy for the player and our club.. for god sake
You see, that's the thing.  It was ages ago that MU started negotiating with Cavani and it seems to me that we've now at last done the deal
Mark..i feel your pain cos this club is breaking my heart😢😢👹
Have we turned into L.A Galaxy ? The last stop before punditry 🤦‍♂️
I will wake up , and all this would have been a bad dream .
This is a 50/50 signing for me. Free on high wages and obviously not brought in to be the starting 9. I think he provides us something we don’t have and an upgrade to Ighalo. Hopefully this will help keep Tony and Marcus fit this season
I don’t under how u pay €10million to cavani agent and heavy wages that if u add everything up it’s the extra €30million Dortmund is asking for sancho  🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ The people that does transfer for united are awful
Mark he has been talking to teams david Beckham was begging him to go to Miami! A few teams wanted him! But he thinks he still has a value like zlatan and they simply couldn't afford his wages david Beckham wanted him but said we couldn't afford his wages!
How are you saying this is a bad deal, Cavani is goals. It allows more options on the wings and to rest up players when bringing him on. Cavani is sick but yes we want Sancho. Cavani Martial Sancho Rashford Greenwood. But how would it all fit? Still desperate for a proper winger
I wonder if Ole was even consulted! Jose didn't want Fred
This is embarrassing 🤦‍♂️ Our board is the biggest joke ever they don’t listen they don’t follow what they say and it’s not enough they said  sancho is our highest transfer target and they haven’t even got close to their asking price
Will we ever learn this will not end Well ?
Falco 2.0
I think certain games when teams play deep and we cant use pace or  get behind!  then playing players together like van de beak cavani  mata pogba are an alternative to unlock these teams it gives us a Plan B
Ed is playing BS bingo with South American country signings. He already got Colombia, Chile, Argentina (even stamped it twice, kinda like a Rojo challenge) and now Uruguay.
Glazers preparing their seasonal Let's-Blame-It-On-The-Manager-And-Sack-Him-The-Fans-Will-Be-Fooled-Completely campaign. Ole will be putting on a brave face whilst packing his bags for Christmas, maybe Summer.  What makes it worse is that the fans probably, right on cue, according to the Glazers' plan, probably will fall for it, and turn on the manager, having forgotten all of this mess.
For me saint maxmin is the only player that I would accept missing out on sancho on
I think cavani is a signing that is too keep the fans happy as Ed definitely hasn’t signed sancho and is probably gonna sign dembele so he is a concellation signing alex telles on the other hand is a good signing
Mark keeps saying he doesn’t like Cavani. A player who has scored approx 350 career goals in approx 570 games. Yeah, lots not to like there!?? I feel an agenda coming on
We definitely need a striker, but as old as Cavani.
Poundland 2010 Juventus
Apparently we are paying £10 mil a year, two year deal, with a £10 mill agent fee. Total cost is £30 mill for a bench warmer. Yet we are haggling for Telles, who is a bloody bargain. What a bunch of muppets.
Let's face it desperation all over Man United transfer situation
Falcao 2.0
A million ads pal, not enjoyable at all
Mark Goldbridge, right now Man Utd desperately need a striker and so this is actually very good news. Though  Sancho is an exiting player would he really make more of a difference than a world class striker in the team? Despite his age he is still one of the very best finishers on the planet. In fact I recently heard that he is the 4th top goal scorer in the last 10 years in Europe. He is miles better than Jovic, who by the way was loaned off to Frankfurt from Benfica before he went to Real where he's done nothing significant.
*Mark’s face at the beginning of the video* 😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂
I think it a gd decision because last season with injuries have a striker that can score
Sky Sports news is saying it as well
This is it mate!!!!
I’m done watching this team this season.  This is a TOTAL failure.  This is Harry Maguire on steroids
How old is Cavani
new number 7 just u wait and see
Op
Are u fucking kidding me?  This guy is FINISHED!
Just think this is another Falcao/Sanchez move, massive wages and way past his best
Were gonna end up signing Florent Malouda on deadline day, he used to be good, right? About 15 years ago? He will do. Board is full of mongs, aint got the foggiest
SANCHO LOL!
I just like this deal cause I forgot the feeling of signing new players
Last season Cavani only played 14 games for PSG but still scored 8 goals in them games and he only started 12 of those! And also scored another 4 international goals aswell! Not bad from a player coming back from injury 12 goals in 19 games!
If he's free, why are we paying an agent?
Mark let it go..Sancho is not coming
This is a bad deal we need LB CB RW and but striker when we have like 4 strikers I like him but they should have buy what we need first
I thought ole wanted to move away from the old boys club and build a young hungry team who want to play for the badge..so much for that then..reminds me of Sanchez.. why don't we ever learn??👹
I support Liverpool but Cavani Played Bad Because Mbappe And Neymar we’re playing side to side with thats why they should play him upfront by him self and if you sign sancho He should go RM and And The Other LM
Great to see man utd accepting leftovers 😂😭🤣
United must be using internet explorer for their transfers, we seem to be signing players that were good several years ago. Alexis, zlatan, falcao and now cavani. someone please get them on to google chrome 🙏🙏
He's not joining us to win the CL or the PL. He's a mercenary selling to the highest bidder. We're stupid enough to try and be the highest bidder in a deal with no other big bidders..
He improves our squad simple as don’t care what the agent makes
We are spending £10 mill on agents fees and we are haggling over Telles. We are run by bloody losers. We need to get rid of Woodward
Absolute Joke
Cavani reminds me of another Lukaku. Pump ball foward or get the ball on his head. Utd don't play that way.
Cavani fits right into our strategy of signing young, hungry, English players
The mighty Facunda Pellistri signing too
Fcuk sake 🤦🏻‍♂️
Cavani or Josh king? Cavani everyday
I'll actually be happy if with this signing if we get Sancho
Cavani is Top Class 😈
Upamacano over sancho for me adressing the real problem
No transfer policy, no plan, just vibes
Sancho isn’t joining
Have you thought mark that the owners dont really trust ollie with young potential players! If I'm honest I wouldnt I don't think he is technically good enough to bring players on!
Hahahahaha... Regards LFC 😂🤣
Tbf a bit of experience added to our attack will help as they are all young, he might help martial to get into positions to score lots of goals
He thinks its American hand and football🏈🤔
We cant afford to buy  a striker and if martial got injured I can think of worse players than cavani! If we bought a top striker for 100 million they would still want 200 grand a week
I hope cavani come with the guy fox mustache look... everyone needs to start wearing guy fox masks at ot and outside.  Would be nice
Organisational decision-making at Manchester United mirrors the “Garbage Can” model. The Cavani signing is very environmentally friendly as it recycles unwanted players.
Better than martial
I feel sorry for Ole, if he gets sacked because we bought Cavani during this window.
We could still possibly get dembele on loan with cavani and  also sancho along with van de beak that wouldn't be bad! Cavani and dembele can be covered just by alexis Sanchez wages!
pointless buying Cavani...Man Utd's gameplay and formation will mean he will get few chances...both Man u's full backs can't cross (AWB) and won't cross (Shaw) and man u don't play with conventional wingers that cross all  Man u's forwards are strikers (Rashford, Martial and Greenwood).  I can't see this working....should have broke bank to get Chillwell and Upamecano ages ago....bit Tuanzabe and Mengi could seize there chance this year...if Lindelof and Maguire continue to be poor positionally and still remain amongst the slowest CB's in the whole of Europe
Doest he have to self isolate when he arrives in the UK
Sorry Goldbridge but signing Cavani is not like signing Falcao! Falcao had just returned from a serious injury when he joined united and we never saw the best of him. We don't have any raw power or aerial ability up top at the moment and Cavani brings that. I can only see this as a positive.
Terrible deal awful
This is why we can't sell players  like Jones's  and Cavani.
Chung muuuuuuu
"It's literally Falcao".  🤔
Woodward has not learned from his mistakes.
99% Sancho done deal.....  He's staying @ Dortmund ffs. Glazers Out
United's forward line-up James........Cavani.......Lingard  What could go wrong LOL
Mark mate, you skewed your opinion in my ways. Remember weeks ago you said Chilwell is crap comparing to your elite left back in the Premier League Shaw. Just look at how Chilwell playing today against Crystal Palace.
Embarrassing
The main difference between us and Leeds we have a far better team but they have a far better manager
Carry on doing the board mannerisms Mark it's hilarious
Oh how the mighty have fallen
Cavani is an experience striker. So my happiest thing is that,Rashford and Marshall we learn from him. He is a good signing to the club.
90%! 90%!
Ole the coward.
Guy is a flop when the pressure is on. Terrible waste of a signing. Ed, sod off!
I remember when we signed teddy sheringham at 31 and that's when 31 was old for a player and ppl ridiculed it! And he didnt turn out too bad! Same with zlatan  Cavani is in that mold these players are clever the first yard is in there head!
I'm f'in fuming, I'm livid cavani is so bad. This deal is so bad
Sancho next
You’d rather get Rooney back from Derby
We need first team signings not bench players we have enough of them
He's a good striker.  No guarantee he could do well in EPL.
Ed is the world champion at settling for anything with legs at chucking out time....  His fave chat up line was... Get up out of the vomit You've pulled...
there should be a cap on these agents fees! They are ruining soccer!!!!
He is  a united player now end of.
Mark if we had a top elite manager i agree buy all young players with potential! But we have a very inexperienced manager even tho hes been a manager 10 year! We have a manager who you say is learning on the job so I think a bit of experience is not a bad thing!
Stinks of Falcao and Sanchez
Edison Cavani...is must be a joke? Cavani is not what he was few years ago...not even close. So its must be a joke right? No other club wants him not even for free. He will be an overpaid injury prone striker that had his hightlight years a decade ago.
We cannot let this one slide! They’re gonna hype it up with positivity and most of us will back Cavani after he signs, but people responsible for this transfer window and all player negotiations need to be sacked!
OFFICIAL BREAKING NEWS: MANCHESTER POONITED IS FINISHED. VERY UPSETTING
Instead of Ighalo coming In Cavani will. Just imagine that Goldbridge 🤔🤔🤔
Manu need sancho and telles, but i can only think this is instead of sancho with martial rotated to the wing!
Ridiculous how many ads you’ve put on this video .. already has 5 and barely 10 minutes in
Dead wood cavani
Straight up facts from goldbridge desperate signing
But mark bales game was all about pace! Zlatan and cavani were never about pace there about power and  technique and been clever! These players can last into mid 30s hes not goin to start every game but good player to have in reserve!
This is 100% wrong...He will hardly get a game so he will hardly score ..we might as well just gone with Ighalo..this will cost a fortune for nothing..
Cavani is the Uruguayan Ighalo😂 good job Man United!
Hes good at heading Mason can turn that forehead into a consistent 20p
Scary thing is mark said the same about taking anyone at the end of last year's transfer we are broken record fc
Sign Chellini and Fabio Grosso now and we are done for next 5 years
❤️ ❤️ ❤️
this deal is a big WTF? he better score 30 goals this season, when we can't bring in Telles and Sancho? does this mean we have given up on Telles and Sancho, i can see that ighalo is not a striker for the prem but is this Cavani at 33+. well so long as it doesn't jeopardize these others so be it but oh dear! i can't stop feeling ill, so hope he does a job for the club for two seasons.
JAMES RODRIGUEZ WAS NEVER IN THE RUNNING FOR MAN U EVER YOU ABSOLUTE DELUDED LITTLE ANIMAL... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA JAMES ONLY MOVED TO PREMIER LEAGUE BECAUSE OF ANCELOTTI, THE MOVE TO EVERTON WAS SPOKE ABOUT BACK IN APRIL... YOU ABSOLUTE FOOL...
Jovic would of been a better fit on loan to try before you buy
The wages that we shave off from Pereira/Sanchez/Dalot/Smalling & Igahlo (After he moves on) will more then make up for Canvani’s wages..Providing additional experience & fireworks upfront...i wouldnt mind
This club is an absolute joke!
You Man U fans know this is a disparate deal.
oh god,.... the whining is just appalling
So we getting players at the end of there career now what are we china?
Cavani not a bad signing! If martial not in form or injured we cant put all the weight on Greenwood yet! I can think of worse back ups than cavani! Rather have him king! We are the only club that can prob afford what he wants that's all mark
This is not a Falcao deal. Falcao had a serious injury that he could never recover from that strongly inhibited specific movements. Cavani has no such injury. Cavani deal is more similar to Zlatan deal.
If we get cavani and sancho not the worst sanario in the world.🙈
Ivona humpalot lol 😂😂😂
Edinson... fucking... Cavani.  And we thought Adidas did us dirty with the stripes.
We could of put those agents fees and wages towards Sancho and Greenwood could of covered Striker and RW.. WTF is WOODWARD doing.. this club does my head in.. FFS..
Does anyone know how old Cavani is? Mark never mentioned.
Mark: "Cavani is not part of the plan" Ole: "What plan?"
United A 🎪 no plan what so ever 😡
Does this mean Sancho is off?
GLAZERS OUT
Great singing on a free BUT! I do feel this means no Sancho and a way to try and take the fans mind off it!
Marks such a Mr know it all 90% my arse.
If the cavani deal happens... It will be a total worth of 30 million. Absolute joke
OMG too many repetitions elongates the video
One year deal with extension option Mark.
Hasn’t been confirmed by Fabrizio yet soooo
Good transfer
Embarrassing is the word.
Cavani at Man Utd. Never thought I'd See the day, what a time to be alive!
This is amazing.
I think cavani will be a good signing better than no striker at all! if it's free transfer! Hes an elite striker aguero Ronaldo messi Ibrahimovic these players can play for longer because the first yard is in there head! like teddy sheringham was for United not quick but clever! strikers like cavani will always  score goals makes our bench stronger if nothing else
Hope his contract is drawn on the basis of matches played. Agents fees on a free transfer! Let Cavani pay his agent!
DESParation
FCUK sancho get him next year for free get centre back and defence midfielder out of the 100 million facts you bullshitting again goldbridge cavini handy free transfer
It feels like deja vu with Henrik Larsson, Ibrahimovic, and Falcao signings. The whole transfer windows are just reiterations of the same formulaic pattern. Other patterns were Ronaldo, Nani, Bebé and Fernandes.
we may as well go buy rooney
In what world would you pay an agent 10mil two days prior to the transfer window closing when nobody else wants him...
You say United are the only team interested in Cavani, but you could say the same about Sancho. What if we are the only club willing to pay the wages/only team who can afford to?
Give him a chance. If he can only show 80 percent of the once was then I m not against it. If Sancho arrives as well then I  m positive
i could see us paying agent / joining fee if other clubs were also  interested in cavani... and why are we paying so much to a player who would be out of job if no one signs him?
I prefer us not to sign anyone
Garbage
Looking forward to seeing Cavani in a Utd jersey. Let's see what he's got.
HAHAHA Cavahni ! , he looks like Mr Dead ..... NOW ! . What's he gonna look like by the end of his contract. ? . He makes Ian Dowie look like a women's pin up :-). No reflection on his football prowess. Might be excellent. Purely on his ' looking like he's got in early for Halloween '  He deffo will not be needing a mask :-)
Hows Tahith Chong doin in Germany?
Cavani only holds every scoring record he could. He's proven it on the world stage. And he's free. And Utd fans want to spend $100m on an unproven youngster who plays in a highly uncompetitive league, has no track record on the biggest stage... Yeah, alright Goldbridge, you really know your stuff
I’m afraid If Cavani signs we wont get Sancho and Cavani Will be a flop
I personally think injury free I will score goals but we have no wingers to provide him
Dortmund are a plc so any bid for any player has to be announced for share holders so that shows that not a single bid's been in for Sancho, Utd asked and was told the price and the deadline. If Sancho puts in a transfer request then he will give up the 29.8million euros owed to him if Dortmund was to sell him without him putting a request in. Fabizio on cbssports phone call
I think I'm going to give up on football
cavani better than sancho...
Cavani is world class and Will bag is golas ur mad
Real Manchester United fans will back the owners, back the board, back the manager and back the players.  Please stop this negativity, it does not help anybody.  Just back the club 100% and let's all be united.   GGMU
I wouldve rather had thiago silva as a free agent
You've got no idea what's going on behind the scenes Mark. You host a podcast and gossip about transfers. I think that says it all
If we don't get Sancho maybe    cavani striker martial on the left and rashford on the right?
Smh we’ve just done another Ighalo 😓
We talk about human rights issues with the Saudi’s, but if anyone knows there history over the last century they make the saudi’s look like angels! They also fund them today! It’s all about United.
panic buy! has been available all Summer
200 goals in 309 apps for PSG and a decent record in CL and international football great header of the ball and a warrior he will score goals in my opinion but still we do need a CB and they must get Sancho this summer
CAVANI with sancho would be great. Without someone on the right wing we’re still gonna struggle.
Whats up with United and PSG swapping 30 year olds, Zlatan, Herrera, now Cavani? Idc what happens with this window anymore it’s already failed. Failed from the begining
Honestly am going on loan from United.. We no longer have the strength
Could anyone honestly argue getting cavani is better than loaning bale?
This is the part of a kid movie where it skips forward a few months to December Christmas time and Mark has a Cavani shirt chanting his name after Cavani gets his first Manchester United hat trick.   What dreams are made of lol
Are the glazers or Ed Woodward secret Leeds fans? This is the only thing I can think of which makes our recent transfers make sense.
Hope cavani does well but doubt it, the worst part is this comfirms we will NOT sign sancho to me. We are a joke and prob wont get top 4
If we sign telles and a centre back along with Cavani I won't be complaining personally.
This team is a joke!!! 10million per year👏🏾
shirt number cavani will get will be telling af, if he gets #7 he wore most his career, game over
Moans all summer that we’ve not signed anyone... moans when we sign someone
I’m going to loose my s..t
Yay  .
Can someone try to make me understand this stupidity we spend the entire transfer window chasing a young talented (Sancho) and we are ending up with an aging and expensive striker who has passed his peak.
I think this is a joke, cavani woulda been a good singing 6 years ago! He is a good player but he’s finished for a league like the prem. All we need is sancho, greenwood is out backup striker! Dan James backup for the Lw, get sancho and Sarr for sancho backup this board is a joke
No I don’t think we will sign sancho we are top 4 club now shame I hate that
I honestly thought this was a joke, I thought he had retired.
Everything is telling me this won’t work. However, my feelings are he could be great. I love this Ruud, Falcao hair in a United shirt. That sounds stupid and in the future with hindsight just like with Falcao I might think I let my heart rule over my head again. I am less excited about this than I was with Falcao though.  Got rid of Sanchez’s wages to get his
Classic Ed Cuntsward panic buy signing. There’s nothing to look forward to with this team
I like Cavani but this completely goes against the "young British talent" plan. This club is a mess from top to bottom. I don't get the plan.
Couldn't this be like the zlatan signing i think its going to be a good one adit gives greenwood and Martial someone experienced and good in the position they are playing to learn from it also gives greenwood time in that rw position.
Woodward signed Cavani, because he has a strong first name EDison.
I honestly rather have josh king
Manu being the biggest club but you don't have players of yesteryear so, be a bit humble to.gradually rebuild, learn to walk again before you run!! Mark just.keeps repeating his frustrations and it's getting so boring!
if cavani is half better than teddy sherringham at this age ...he may be good deal
United unwilling to pay over the odds for a player that would be free to sign in 8 months time made perfect sense until we agreed to pay cavani's agent €10M for sending a text.
Why not just get Memphis instead? Cheaper wages, younger, can play on both wings and if necessary up front?
why arent we getting chiesa? he's cheap, fast, defends, can score and assist.  reminds me alot like kanchelskis
I think he's finally realised 😂😂😂😂 very quiet
That's good r bad ?
OLE: I want a 20 year old winger who's one of the best young players in the world.   ED: How about this striker who used to play football with the dinosaurs?
Ole always said when he was playing there was 4 world class strikers… Now he’s the dad with his high standards putting his kids in the same situation as himself.   Rashford, Martial and Greenwood learning off Cavani  I don’t know about this. United haven’t been creating chances for the striker so Martial has to make his own. For Cavani to work Pogba, Fernandes, VDB and Sancho will have to be creating him chances.
This is a disgraceful signing, what is our club doing? Woodwood and judge need to go now! 10m in agent fees!!!!! I feel sick inside. Cant believe we walked away from a bale deal for this 😂. We are a joke!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a SHITE buy!! A useless panic signing by the Board to try to appease the fans. Well it WON'T WORK!! Ole doed not want him nor do the fans. Cavani is a BOARD Signing!! He is over the hill, injury prone & another Sanchez, only at Utd for the wages he's getting. Dembele would have been a better "panic buy".
This prat has never watched Sancho play a full Dortmund game in his life!!!! Wants Sancho anyway? He’s fucking rubbish!!!!! Wait and see!
Panic buying 😓
What's with all the advert s omg! 🤣🤣🤣
Waste of wages. Man Utd need defenders, replacement for Matic and someone who can cross the ball into the pot (yes Sancho does fit that bill.) People who get paid huge sums have done a terrible terrible job all window......again.....Thanks fella, in agreement on this one.
Golden shower Cavani. I’m in total despair now at our club.....
Cavani
Cavani scores 20+ goals this season
Plan ain't to bring in Cavani alone I'm hoping... Even if Sancho ain't coming which He ain't! A right wing alternative to Sancho plus Telles and a quality center half to play alongside Maguire should be bought ... 🤞🏾
banter fc at it again, need a cb and rw, I know lets get a striker, fucking useless board
Listen, it may not be the signing we all want, but it gives us some striking quality to put on the bench. Remember, Cavani can also bring experience and leadership to the dressing room.
Its as if they’ve sat around a table for 24 hours and thought who could be the worst player on ridiculous wages??? Said cavani in the first minute... went through every player in world for the next 23 hours and 59 minutes and then went ....no it’s definitely Cavani!  Go get him!
You guys in England are not vocal and wild enough on this board, this stupid behaviour cannot happen in my part of the world in Africa. The supporters will be at their door by morning. The supporters in the UK needs to act now.
Mark,if Sancho doesn't come then send Woodward that broken & mouldy Pringle.😕
No news outlet is more reliable than BBC. YES BBC have confirmed.
We need Grealish.
Good video this time Mark. Answering the questions and speak about it. I like that very much. Keep it going. Hopefully the next transfer isnt Mario Götze? Hes also a free agent and played with Sancho at Dortmund. Maybe that will help? Haha
Im with mark! Ive never thought much of cavani either! Journeyman
Cavani is a near-perfect signing as a backup for Martial. Proven. What's the big deal?
Good signing. We need a propa number 9 for the change in formation, just need that number 7 here ASAP!!!
One of my favourite number nines,hope he stays fit
Maybe Jones requested this to have long term company in sick bay & to learn another language.Seriously I wanted cavani but that was about 5yrs ago.I hope he does a job but i thought they'd stopped signing OAP in football terms.This club wastes so much on wages but kicked their heels in when it comes to saving a few quid to get the players they go for.The wages issue is the problem as when they want to get rid of them other clubs aren't willing to match what they were earning at utd & we end up with sending them out on loan or selling them on the cheap.I think Ronaldo was the only player we've made a big profit on who we've bought.It's staggering how poorly run this club is considering the status as one if not the biggest club in the world.First rate fans let down & run by second rate people! 😖
another panic
He was at 210k a week and he will be paid around the same amount.....what hell are they thinking and how can we afford sancho now.......this is high level idiocacy......
Idk how I feel about this deal if I’m honest , great striker hope he performs top tier , scores plenty and likes the club
Ole at the wheel with Reg Cavarney
Our ambition truly is dead
This is a FUCKING DISASTER!!!!
Mark you a cake, you can't have everything your own way mate......the way united is ran we can go off foe everything
We have sign Tarzan
This means no Sancho
If United wanted a second striker why did they extend ighalo loan
United should sign Adama Troare...
I rather have a blind romelu lukaku up front
If Cavani is on 200+k per week then I don't believe we are going to sign Sancho aswel, yes Cavani is free transfer but we aren't going to come up with 100+mill for Sancho & then pay him upwards of 100+k per week aswel as paying Cavani over 200k per week.... no chance
If we do get CAVANI, I see the chances of SANCHO plummeting!!!!!
What happened to getting young, hungry players with the new 'vision' our club is working towards?
Mark doesnt like cavani? What a idiot smh
You know sweet all about man utd you lemon
IM LOVING IT .... WE GOT JOTA AND THIAGO. 🍾 CAVANI TO MANCHESTER UNITED OMG.🤣🤣👍
Like woman moaning. 200k is cheap.  He starting he better than martial
We are banter fc
Panic buy Fc
10 mil in agent fees on a player way past his prime probs will be injured and miss half the season wow things never change
WOODWARD and his donkey crew are prob so clueless they’re thinking by bringing in Cavani will turn them from a donkey to a Goat.
I remember watching a psg game just before we played them in the champions League. Cavani had a penalty and he got injured by just taking the penalty.. that's the player we're having. I'd be happy if he scores 10goals
Be funny if he gets the number 7 😂😂
Im Done with this club im hitting my last nerve right now😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
He's quality lads great signing
After watching the suspenseful and thrilling  drama of the Liverpool transfers. I've come here for some comedy now! lol
We best sign Sancho or it's gonna royally kick off 😕
Haha WHAT A JOKE
United should sign Rudiger
We need to back him i hope he scores goals for us. Its not sancho the board are parasites and an absolute shambles sanchos not coming this is it ladies and gentleman this is our window finished
Id laugh I cavani scored in every match he played and silenced you
yh but what is he on a week 200k?
70 seconds in n theres adds 🤦🏿‍♂️ im out
Cavani is the number 7. Lol
Sancho to United for me
I don't want that dug up guy Fawkes at Man Utd
Carvani is not better than Igalo my friend.Since lgalo came to Man United he has never been given chance to prove himself.Each time he starting League cup is with players like James and McT Lingard  who can't give a good pass or even create a chance. But you guys are quick to judge him without giving him chance to prove himself to be a bad player.
United are finished we are footballs equivalent of pound stretcher.
200k a week to sit on the bench cuz surely he won’t be replacing anyone in the first team
Fans - " He is better than Ighalo, it's a good signing" Mark - " Albrighton is better than Dan James , should we sign him ? Mark noble is better than mctominay, should we sign him ?".........Nice one Mark 😂😂😂
I might not follow football this season 😔
After forty six years of watching the reds cavani  is a joke that's it  no more  couldn't care less now till this board goes  old should resign now and  everyone would respect him  for doin it cos he will be sacked  at Xmas anyway
Cavani is a good signing tbf he physical and great on set plays ..
I can't believe this. Who is advising the club on transfer. Hope this doesn't turn up like Sanchez deal. These people don't learn.
I like how they won’t pay 15million for tellers but 10 million for Cavanis agent ffs
not so happy for this deal but he may just get the goals we need
20.13 Mark possessed by Chewbacca?
It doesn't make sense if we sign Sancho then play Greenwood in the middle, why sign Cavani and limit Greenwoods game time? He's a generational talent who could be better than Rooney ffs
All this talk and has anyone remembered that we actually need a defence??? Seen better defending at my sons 5 a side on a Sunday 🙄
believe or not believe, in this year man united has died and may 9nth rank . SORRY RIP RIP RIP UNITED
Calvert-Lewin is tearing up the premier league? Lollllllllll, smh
Cavani new nr 7 ?
Never re-heat yesterday's dinner
What a load of bollocks United has become
We will not pay porto 18m for alex telles but we will pay 10m for cavani agent if we wait for alex telles contract to run out we will pay more than buying him now
I would take Prime Cavani but not current Cavani
I think sea levels just rose half a foot from all the tears from united fans!
unfollowed united on all socialmedia
Are we now "Crumbs from Top Sides" FC? BS
Mark wants us to be elite and yet backs Ole as manager. 🤯😂
Sorry, but no Sancho.  Our management is pathetic.  We won't sign Telles, Partey or Upermacano. I doubt we will sign anyone else.
It's so sad to se these donkeys of bank men ruin the club I've grown to love for the last 25 years.
Our main priorites was Sancho and a center back. With two nights left we have got ...
I don't even know what to think about this
Watched 10 secs before an advert...😭
Injury phone past his best
Terrible signing
never mind Liverpool we should be more worried about Leeds & Everton
I’m sorry but this is 100% oles buy. There is no way Woodward has forced this on ole.  Ole has probably been demanding a last minute striker, the scouts have provided a list and Ole has picked his choice
United old age home..welcoming retired players with love.🤣
Why TF aren’t United signing Telles?! Who the hell is paying €10m in agent fees when we ain’t even paying €18m for Telles. These guys are idiots. The United board needs to be sacked. I love United but I ain’t buying Merchandise until the structure of this club changes.
I think is diferent then Falcao becouse we had Falcao with van persie and rooney and other older strikers. We have a lot of young attackers that (other then greenwood) have bad finishing in sitters and he is experienced, we need more experience to do good en Champions League and he is not good enough to go over martial but good enough to replace him if he can’t play for any reason. I think is not smart to bring a young backup striker that won’t play tooo much when he needs to be developed like Dan James. The salary is something bad becouse we bring another overpayed player in a team that fights for top 4 like us and the glazzer will want to buy less players couse they are cheap
We should go for jovic
To point made about Leeds, yes, tactically they are great, but the fitness level of the team is absolutely bananas. City's players were gasping for air at the end of that game. Wish our team had that level of fitness.
I like cavani, always thought he was very underrated, good option off the bench, like a cheaper ibrahimovic deal if you ask me, rather have him than josh King, psg certainly are missing him, he works hard and knows where the back of the net is, always thought he was better for Uruguay than suarez (not saying he's overall a better player) think he could help teach martial, greenwood and rashford some good things.
Y haven't man u got alex telles man u is a joke
Cavani is an absolute baller. Watch
Why can’t we just buy a winger, whether it’s sancho or dembele, and then have greenwood play as the substitute striker. I don’t understand the point of canvani. We might as well get a winger.
Josh king is better option than cavani mark
Aaaannndd here comes an injury
Manchester united hospital FC.. hell bent on signing  injury prone players.🤣
Ladies and gentlemen - FALCANI.  HERE WE GO!!!
Not sure how to feel about this
To be fair to the board Cavani was only 27 when they started negotiations
We should still back him but oh boy what a random signing
Retirement FC 🤕🤕👨🏻‍🦳👨🏻‍🦳
Cavani looks so old in that thumbnail!
cheaper than ighalo, better than ighalo, different dimension from martial/rashford. give it chance.
Welcome to Manchester UTD Cavani regardless!
No wonder were  a Laughing Stock  Signing over the Hill Has-Been's
Better then nothing 😂🤷‍♂️
the question is cavani is he a Ole signing or a club signing going over ole’s head?
We should have gone jovic loan, or we should have signed haaland in January
man united have to sign players in place of LIndelof, show and sancho should be sign
We needed a striker to push martial for this place, like your saying sancho better be done as well. Has beens for shirt sales does not convince me I hope I am massively wrong.
Hes a senior player with a winning mentality, squad desperately needs somebody like that. Very good signing for free but sancho is a MUST
This board is waste of space. Get the glazers out and bring in the Saudis.
Liverpool will get Sancho next summer. Watch them do it.
Mark assumes we can get players that don’t want to play for MU!!
The young forwards especially Greenwood will learn from him valuable first hand lessons in training. Apart from that I can’t see him as a signing that will impact the front line that much in games. Too slow for the premier league at this stage of his career. Good luck to him though!
Like evra say...keep sending lawyer when trying signing player...apart from trying to sign Sancho ,what about voice out your club need sporting director ffs..
I'd rather sign Defoe, plus didn't united not want to pay thiago 200k
MU transfer is so pathetic that even signing Dumbo the elephant is a win situation.
our doors are still open  look at our defenders
James Rodriguez another brace of goals
Please remember ighalo and cavani are signed cuz we failed to get haaland. Let that sink in.
I'm worried
Mark, you are beginning to piss us off. How do you know we did not go in for Cavani in August, and managed to beat off the competition? What makes you think we did not try for Bale and James, and they choose Everton (because James trusts Ancelotti), and Bale loves Spurs. Please think before you speak. You are loosing the fans respect these days by making too many assumptions. You are not in the know my friend
Also if we’re getting Cavani who’s good with his head and a target man, WE NEED TELLES!! That partnership could be deadly but knowing our board, we won’t get him.
RIP RIP RIP United has died in 2020/2021
When was last time we score a header from a cross , he will be option in the last 20 mins of a game
Cavani and Odion Ighalo are actually party of the plan. The plan is a shift to very good younger players with room to grow, not a wall against all older player signings. Whether it's a good idea or not, Solksjaer likes the idea of having an experienced, reliable backup striker who is willing to fill a hole but play second fiddle to priorities Martial and Greenwood. Ighalo seemed to work when he first came, but has quickly dropped off and shows no signs of getting back to his best. Maybe Cavani can provide that sort of cover as a free transfer on bigger wages that can teach Greenwood and Martia a thing or two without demanding to be in every game.
Mark stop backing Ole he’s a cheap yes man
What of martial?
This is how low we can go, there's no way we can get to winning trophies any sooner,there's no way u fail in the transfer market and expect to win any silverware 😰😰😰😰😰
Surprised he's joining after what happened with his team mate Di Maria at this club
Good ! CAVANI is a serious old school ! Someone the casual young team can learn from someone pogba will need to respect !  James, greenwood and rashford will listen and learn from him !
This is all stupid I am glad I just enjoy football as a game no more united stress. 😂😂😂😂 Leeds is a very good team who watched the game today 👌🏾
We all knew what happened when they didnt  sign Bruno. This time could be worse if they didnt sell Sancho
Another financial flop coming up !!!!
Cavani is an Ighalo replacement. Guess who's release clause activates in 2022?
This deal reminds me of Higuian
20:10
How much was he or was it a loan
Oh, Pension payout  club !!!!
Now tons of reports saying Cavani starts over Martial will pour out over the media. He’s a great backup option but idk about starting
U not angry coz u just wanted a signing
Cavani is a fantastic signing (hardworking, high level of professionalism, can help younger players.)  ONLY IF we make another couple of proper signings like sancho etc.. fingers crossed lads.
, 😩😩
That 10 mil could’ve gone towards sancho and telles absolute joke
I cannot believe mark still  believes we will get sancho. It's time for action let's get these bankers out our club.
Definitely Fourthchester United tactics.
So after all that wait on Sancho we ended up in 34 years old cavani, the person doing our business really really hates man united wtf man
Ugh dead signing didn’t want him
United is now old people's Home.
Have we become this club  yes
After reading a lot of the comments which I agree with some....on the flip side, Cavani could be a success as knows how to finish and adds some physicality to our strikers compared to martial and rashford ....but I'm just not sure as this looks desperate...i hope sancho joins for Marks sake
I wish cavani all the best when he joins because as much as I don't agree with this signing we're still manutd supporters and we shouldn't wish our players to flop so as to prove a point hope sancho is next
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😠
This is a Fred, Dalot summer. VDB and Cavani - end of. And it hurts.
This is your rw expect josh King tomorrow after the game
So the agent fee for Cavani is more than we're prepared to pay for Telles :(
When sancho comes it will be a very benefit for mufc and canvani has very  easy to get the ball.Cavani is an experienced striker without a good perfect rw team would not take premier league and the team would not be on the top 4 and uefa chapions league will only be in the dream
You aint getting Sancho you're getting mugged off again
Here is the deal Cavani is a fantastic player,  Utd has sign another Vp  Any concern can be a goal, This channel want utd to sign Sancho he may endup as hazard who's now a bench warmer in Madrid
Fernandes🔥🔥🔥⚽️⚽️⚽️🥅🥅🥅
Ighalo has more energy than the current lot. That's why no one knows when and how to pass to him. I'm afraid we're at the pre SAF level. The odd winning streak in the league flatter in the cup then flop. Ighalo can at least run to the opposition box. Cavani would have to Uber
i dont understand why do players still wanna go to man utd. for the past fews year, almost  every player that goes to man utd not only did they not improve, they become worse.
Cavani to wear 7 i bet
Marks analogy I love it 🤣😭 “Poundland Falcao deal”
🚫OLE OUT🚫
If Cavani is supposed to be our markee signing it’s like throwing a cup of water onto a burning building.
might be ok but he to slow for the way i like to see teams play he better then that ighalo guy but is this really what you needed idk anyway at least city never won hehe im a lfc so what do i know
90% a pratt
cavani is a great player when healthy.
We bought someone who is past it and had never played in the prem.  Classic United board
Give Gary Neville the DOF job. But unfortunately he wouldn’t do it.
you keep saying that nobody wanted him, as if united could buy someone that all the clubs want.
Hope🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I think I’d rather have josh king 👑
Can name you 400 strikers better than Cavani
Hmmm...I don't like Luke Shaw as a footballer
Utter madnesss, 20£m up in smoke. 200k a week.  Wow what a mess never learn anything from mistakes absolutely no planning... to be left desperate for Cavani you couldn't make this up......lol..
This is an absolute joke feel like we are being set up to be banter FC
😂😂😂
Not a surprise deal from the united board (Ed Woodward) only looking at the commercial side of the business.....cavani 5 years ago was good but not sure current stats....Sancho must be sign before deadline or else united will be ripped apart from the media and other clubs on our incompetence to sign player(s) that united standard should be able to sign last month ago before the deadline date....
I’d of preferred suirez over Cavani don’t care about the Liverpool thing as sir Matt busby played for Liverpool remember
I cant take this no more.
Where is sancho?
If we end up with Cavani and Dembele it will be like going back to when we had Di Maria and Falcao. Why won't they learn?
We sign Cavani and they sign Jota - just shows the gap in the clubs right now.
Mark you dont like doesnt mean he will flop or others are and if someone who is dreaming its you hahaha sancho ok deadline day are you mad mate..
Do you guys have your own brains? It's almost like Mark’s word is gospel and he's getting more  delusional by the day. How is Cavani a better signing then Dembele?
Where is sancho??
Mark saying his not mad about getting Cavani then moaning no one wants him around Europe  which is it ?
No1 will care how old he is  if he scores some goals for us. Dont think we need him but hope he does well and helps us into too 4
Cavani is a monster , be happy , better than what you have now
90  🖕 sancho.where is sa cho!?
Mad wages again. Obviously nothing learned from the Sanchez deal. Crazy!
better than martial upfront too let alone ighalo..martial cannot score one on ones cant head the ball one footed....cavani looks like an animal he is bette roff having martial wide running at ppl
Is there any action we can take as fans? Seriously ! Something needs to be done. A protest at old Trafford needs to happen!
It is a terrible signing from a wage perspective, if we wanted to add a striker at $200k/week we should have pursued Werner or someone similar to his age and quality. $10million in wages to the agent alone could have been diverted to the Telles signing.
Could also be another Zlatan/Larsson. I think it's not bad on a free as a rotational squad player.
This just shows that we didn't have a plan !
Cavani Will be a strong addition.
Not gonna lie I’m happy with this
😂😂😂😂 United way and philosophy...
Cavani will work but forget about sancho rashford will go on the right side and martial back on the left it's a bad deal
Where's sancho?
Better then igahlo 💯
Spot on Mark there something is fishy.. for some reason they want to pay huge wages and fees but not high sign-on fees to clubs ... and let's remember when it comes to cold hard cash there smart guys
Sancho wont sign tommorow  I think this is another Bruno story...He will sign in January and he will come and pick us up from the middle table so we can get champions league football next session because sancho wants to play in the UCL
Can we make an even more desperate signing before Monday evening?
Gabriel will handle cavani no problem
Glazers out
😂😂😂🖕
pls nooooooooo
To me this means we are not getting Sancho because Greenwood wont be playing backup at striker now so he will stay at wing.
Cavani is 32 while Martial is 42 we nid a scorer
Im  Glad that my club Benfica didnt got him ,expensive wages , but also support United ,so , will see how it goes .
The only good thing about Cavani is he can hold the ball up and good with headers when we cant break teams down we go all crossing like liverpool...but thats it 😂
Hey how about Alex tellers what happened
90 % man u is doing the same thing you are doing... blowing smoke. They have no clue what they are doing and you have looked very very very very 90% 90% 90 % 90 % 90% if sancho is not signed by the end you will look real cray cray.
The lid has officially been flipped, Why sign a player that is basically at the end of his career?............. Oh to top up his bank balance for retirement :-/ Bravo Manchester United
Am I the only one happy about Cavani? I don't care if it's a panic buy, he's a quality player. Also his wages are the same as what we pay Mata to warm the bench. Stop being so reactionary.
Cavani is a class player, why you moaning.
GLAZERS OUT OUT OUT OUT
Edison Cavani is an utter disgrace.
Oh no it's Sanchez, Di Maria & Falcao all over again, the clowns are making a move for old age pensioner's, it will be Ronaldinio & Rivaldo next....?
Trump at the wheel
He is only coming for the huge salary for is last contract wasn't interested in Man u years ago wtf
Hold on a minute. I thought the reason why we refused to sign Erling Haaland in the winter was because they didn't want to give Mino Raiola 15 million in his pocket. But we're okay paying Cavani's agent 10 million. The didn't want Haaland to leave after two seasons but they're okay giving Cavani a 2 year contract. So by their standard, two seasons of a broke down Cavani on high wages is better than two seasons with an inform, young Erling Haaland. The way the club is run is a freakin joke.
It's like Ibrahimovic deal he scored 20+goals in all competitions
What in God's sake is going on with our club. It's beyond embarrassment on how our club is being run. Once a football  powerhouse but now turning into a complete laughing stock.It's so heartbreaking to see our beloved club being run by these absolute greedy bloodsucking owners.All of us fans should form a movement against how these owners are ruining our club
He could either be an amazing signing or another Falcao. Desperate last minute signing indeed.
Lmao Cavani united are clutching at straws 🤣🤣🤣
This mean no Sancho, we will put Martial or Rashford on the right. If he starts at ST ahead of Martial I’m actually pissed.
Also I agree with you Mark, I'll let this slide if Sancho is a red by Monday.
Cavani on a 2year contract is a great signing because he has the qualities  we are lacking in the air and when his contract expire Greenwood will be a monster n mature enough to take over as a centre foward
100% a panic buy
Give the man a chance. He ain't nobody. A lethal goalscorer. Excellent in the box. Excellent in the air. These two quality traits are what our current strikers are lacking. Welcome EC to the Theatre of Dreams.
Hope this guy will not become a new Falcao or Sanchez zzz...
Its a good pickup regardless of sancho. We need striker depth. This isnt sancho fc.
rather get no one ffs
Forget sancho
It shouldn't be about whether a player is better than what we have, it should be about whether he is better than what other clubs have.
Wow, may as well support Everton
Buying cavani is like  shopping at bargain buys and giving the cashier a tip
Would of rather had Ibrahimovic again. At least he has been scoring in the last four months
NEXT IBRA....TRUST ME...BTW COULD TEACH RASHY,MARTIAL AND GREENWOOD 💥💥🔥🔥
Also.. SANCHO IS.NOT.HAPPENING
The richest club in the world can only afford a pensioner on crutches. Ffs!
United's physio room (Shaw, Tuamzebe, Bailly, Jones, Rojo) will warmly welcome Cavani.
“Mark noble is better than mctominay” come on mate, that’s out of control.
His a joke
Nice ! Don't Need Sancho Now. You Go Ed, Free is Good.
I’m assuming for 10 million Cavani’s agent is gonna be our new lb?
I'm sick of this board Ed glazers outttttttt 😡😡😡😡
When your neighbour buys a brand new ferrari and you go ahead and get a 3rd hand Ambassador🤣🤣🤣 Now lets  race.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁
10x the finisher of what we’ve currently got when he’s on form in my opinion 👍🏽
We will get harlaand in two years
what a loser club we have become...shame shame shame....no one would take him...but the loser we are...we would.
This is a Woodward/Adidas, jersey-selling deal; and they are right.  Over the next two seasons, Adidas will sell enough jerseys to cover Cavani's fee and wages.  United supporters need to remember that the world no longer revolves around them. Now, on the world stage, the sixth-rate Man United is just an afterthought.
Not another Falcao thank you
Cavani is like too abram too me
Cavani is  similar to Falcao it's unbelievable. Will flop just as bad. Doesn't fit our play whatsoever. Will be making 220k a week to sit on the bench. WHAT IS THE POINT ANYMORE!!! 34 in Feb! Played in half of PSG's league games last season. 4 goals to show for it. Clearly on a downward spiral now and needs to play every week to get anything out of him you'd think. Again. ZERO strategy. Would rather Ighalo played more games. Another one completely frozen out for whatever reason. OGS/Ed/Judge OOOOOUUUUUTTTTTTTT
Goldbridge is a serial waffler
The level of banter this club is putting us through.... its peak!!!
officially the jugaadu FC of PL🤣
Utd is a joke
Would be a typical Woodward deal. Ole had his prime target and be left thinking what's going on again.
How can you change your tune on a Woodward signing like this Mark? Your something else!
No sancho ,martial moves to the RW and cavani plays no.9, this board is ruining our club
Young attackers better than cavani for under 30 million. Daka-salzburg David-lille Cunha-hertha berlin Stengs-alkmaar Boadu-alkmaar Everton-Benfica Ihattaren-Psv Almada-Velez Malen-Psv Dennis-Brugge, Feel free to add more options for woodward
Ole out
Cavani has been brought in as an addition not as a star signing. You can’t go overboard losing yourself over it. You’d rather have Cavani than no one. It’s another body in the squad and one that can actually score goals. What would be better we get no one and then Rashford or Martial get injured we lay it all on Greenwood?
This smacks of desperation and incompetence.. Woody woodpecker has fucked up again.. This will be as bad as Falcao.. Woodward has to go, judge has to go. NOW
We need another ruud van nistelrooy...not cavani..what the hell ed woodprat??
United bascially sold Lukaku, replaced him with a loan signing, replaced the loan signing with a free agent. Lmafo
If Cavani is offered a huge salary then Sancho deal is off. Until then I am 90% club
This is done to sell shirts in Uruguay
Cavani no way.  Iv never liked him   Ffs
Hard competition between Arsenal Vs Man UTD...who will have worst transfer window...I bet Arsenal will win...
Cavani is a better signing than Sancho. We have improved in two areas instead of one. He comes in as our best striker and moves Martial back to the lw where he is much more dangerous.
Where is the future vision gone now??? Bullshit same saga repeating again & again.. Cavani was never part of United's future plan..plz don't just do panic buy to kp some grp of plastic fans happy
Cavani is a okay signing, better than Ighalo and a Josh King I'd say
€10M for agent fee? hmm I can smell corruption somewhere...
What a joke. Another sanchez
RIP Ole
Anyone happy with this deal deserves the Glazers
We need a center half!!!!!!!
WTF!
This is actually nuts... The desperation is unreal 🥵
I'm fuming!!!!!!!
Why are we signing free contracts during the transfer window? We could sign him anytime! Cavani is a better player than Ighalo or the alternative which would be King.
Imagine being unemployed for 8 months and having the cheek to ask for €10 million.
Hey Mark
My prediction is he will be injured withib the first two games
Woodward is a scam. He tells the club and players 200 weekly wages 100 goes to the player 100 goes to him. And why is OLE not in charge of what He wants that shows how weak of a manager He is.
We're dead as a football club..I'll come check this comment 10 years later and see if I'm still right
Last Minute United
I hope he scores like vardy but the board haven't learnt  Its Sanchez, falcao, di Maria type signing
Hahahahaha - this just in, Man U in the hunt for a winger - currently speaking with various retirement homes across the country
Desperate times, hahaha. Pension United
😂😂😂😂😂😂
THE LEVELS OF BANTER THIS CLUB HAS REACHED IS UNTOUCHABLE
Players the board have failed to get Sir Alex, Moyes, LVG, Mourinho, Ole in the last decade.   2011 Sanchez, Sneijder 2012 Moura, Hazard, Gaitan  2013 Baines, Thiago, Fabregas, Bale  2014 Hummels, Kroos 2015 Ramos, Otamendi, Mane, Pedro, Vidal 2016 Muller 2017 Sandro, Perisic, Griezmann 2018 Koulibaly, Morata 2019 Dybala, De Ligt 2020 Haaland, Bellingham, Reguilon, Upamecano, Telles, Sancho  When will those culpable be given the sack?
