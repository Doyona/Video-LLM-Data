Matt you say you like the Tuckers sno cat!!! Why not build yourself a Tucker Sno cat?
I like the bundy matt
Matt, the only way is to make the bombi hydrostatic steer like a bobcat, simple.cheers uncle phil
It doesn't matter what you are driving Peanut is going to be in it, on it or running beside it. She is the most awesome dog I have ever seen. It's obvious she truly loves Everybody that's with or around Matt!
Matt you need to try moxie and even better diet Moxie totally different taste.
Matt I love your YouTube 1:00 channel - I’m from NH  and am 69 years old and I heard you talk about Alaska, which brings me to what I was always told about the lower 48 from my brother-in-law that was in the  Air Force Base in Anchorage any they always made reference to the lower 48 being the 48 continuous states excluding Alaska and Hawaii. So when they talk about the lower 48 it’s from Maine to California and everything in between.. that what we call the lower 48 be good to see what someone smarter them me thinks about this description

You should take a morvairr body and leave the hood on and make it the trunk like a Porsche or VW, gas tank up there like an old VW!
Air Brakes!
You could order a new  Bombi to Spec or buy an old machine that was used to groom the ski slopes and modify it
Where was Jamie at Red Lobster?
Back up camera with medium screen viewed from drivers seat. When I was in Oregon the logging truck had water cooled brakes, you should consider that for the Bombi!!! The doors for the rear seat should open upwards. You should stop calling it the “BOMBI” and call it “ THE UPGRADE”
that is the cutest thing ever
Has anyone asked if drum brakes would be better?? Less fluid needed More braking material
Matt, you recently asked what "the lower 48 means".  If you are standing in Alaska, the remaining United States is referred to as "the lower 48" because it IS separated from Alaska by the Yukon, and British Columbia. I used to live and work in Alaska driving a 64 Kanworth 750 Holmes twin boom wrecker making recoveries all over Alaska, B.C. and the Yukon.
That thing looks like it wrecks the back to steer
Ignore my last comment I should have finished watching all of the video 😅😅 before I commented
Hey Matt when and where did you get the bombi  im only new to the channel and was curious about the history
Why is Facebook feeding me years-old videos, while YouTube will not show the latest videos?
How about using a Greenbriar Estate (Corsair Van ) as a cab for the Bombi
That's not a skylight; it's the buried-in-snow-drift emergency escape hatch!
Is Robby recovered from the welds in the door frame? (at 8:57)?  Sketchy weld of the day.
Happy birthday Tom!!! You guys eat at red lobster way too much!😂😂😂
When Matt pretended to lick the dipstick, I couldn't help think how much he looked like Yukon Cornelius checking his pick for gold! "Nothin'!"
I bet the ignition control module is out on the bombie
my experience with vortec motors when the drop a bank of odd or even cylinders its 99 percent of the time a fuse box issue and considering where its used its possible. but you already decided to get a v8 lol just saying though
Happy birthday Tom Hope you had a great day and many more
you need to get one of those things from couch offroad
That absolute moron decided that was the best location for the battery
Do they not make these snowcats field-servicable in remote areas? Seriously, needing pretty much an entire workshop isn't conducive to survivability. At least let the battery be accessible by a turn of a few screws.
you should get a suzuki jimny imported put a big lft on it and use it as a scout its amall and agile and it can get upwards of 37 mpg
Nice upgrade! Keep it up!
REALLY REALLY need to put the same style headlights on it that you have on the Morvair. Including the covers. THAT would make it look so insane.
Go Lizzy!!!😘Nice boots.
And I live in the town of lasvegas nev  .
❤thebombe  can you put windows in the open and close
Increase the cabin of Bombi by 8 inches or more at the rear corner of the cabin to avoid extra modification, you might move back the engine the same length. You should not remove the storage carrier.  You might need it at the rescue site for pieces that are detached from the vehicle being rescued. The original tires are filled with foam you can pump foam on your regular replacement tires, this was used in Vietnam to prevent flat tire on military trucks...
Why do you say hydromatoc will not work on the bombbee
I’ve been waiting at least 2 years for this. 😂
This build is sick!! I’ve been watching in reverse order to see where the build is going and I love it
It's Yellow Mellow
Just tell the familytoger. Gift carda
Maybe the wrong gas lines probablycauses thepoor runing😮
Classic ending. Love it!
Sweet ending in surprised y’all haven’t  had a video with the dirt every day crew
My jphndeerezero turnmower.  Might have a proper skid steerin one you can use 😊
15:09 Peanut is part cat!
This was definitely on of my favorite episodes.
Fun!!😅
Wanna wish you a happy birthday Tom! 🎉
You should  put a  jeep body  on it
I was thinking, that mesh holder you took off the back of the bombi would make a nice, if rather large, firebox/pit.   Nice for those cold winter days outside.  Just a thought.
I love the story time! God I miss the old team and episode!!! Tom, they were sitting a lot of people in there and they never complained about it like you just did - not in the video.
Happy Birthday Tom.
Need a sun roof hatch for filming! Or a roof mounted seat....
5:45 blink twice if you're in danger lol
Happy Belated Birthday Tom! Hope you enjoyed your Red Lobster.
Matt and grew are the best no Bs grap. They Get it done 👍.
no offense but, if I'm going to spend almost $400 bucks on a battery, I will stick with optima. I had one last 12 years.
on front of that i would put a snow plow as a bumper and lift up and down is you need to clear the road. and check out the trax sti wheel (ken block put a snow wheel on subaru), with type off wheel you can put on you truck and us it in the winter, rather then parking in the garage.
roll cage?
Always liked the Bombi. Looking forward to seeing you guys work your magic on it. Hey Matt; here's an idea of a way you could improve, and still retain, the rear outside storage area (behind the cab). Have you ever noticed how the bed gates function on a VW T-3 Doka (or pickup truck)? Especially the latches (super simple and effective). You might use the same idea for the gates (drop-down/lock-down) but make them more modular and versatile (removable/interchangeable). Also if you are worried about weight, you could make versions out of aluminum or even plastic (with snow fence-type mesh. I really think you're going to want that outside storage capability. CHEERS!

There is a point at which "upgrade" turns into "your own creation"  . . . and you have surpassed it !
Hey, can you submit to another site, I'm getting off youtube
Happy B'Day, Tom!!
Make a larger skylight !! So you can stand up through it like a tank !! (Good escape hatch, God forbid)
I am looking forward to this build! LS time? Please!
The spider injector on that 4.3 might be worth changing for the updated MPI spider from Delphi.  It's a huge improvement in reliability and even a little bump in power and fuel efficiency.
Only a cnut chooses a living thing personally that it wants to eat, toms favourite place to eat has put him on the top cnuts list
What's the chances of making Bomby all hydrostat?
Well those batteries in the Morvair are a whole lot more easy accessable than in the Bambi for sure !!!
I love the OBS ford mirrors on it lmao
this is going to be such a freakin kool build I can't wait to see all the ingenuity and craft that goes into the rebuilding of it
You should keep the roof hatch for emergency use because if the vehicle was buried suddenly in snow  or went down the only way is the roof hatch to evacuate safely Add some isolation rubber and strong lock  to stop the noises while driving and keep the hatch
Perhaps HiViz Led Firetech headlights would be a good update for the bombi’s headlight issue plus they make some awesome general area lighting that would fit right in on the bombi too.  Also perhaps make it a three seater with a sideways rear seat for leg room back there.
Had a local guy built his own snow cat and had the same brake problems you have with your Cat.  So he built another one but somehow he built a clutch system into each lever so it would disengage the drive line when you pulled back on the lever, and then actuate the brake when you pulled back a little more.  Worked great and didn't have the brakes heating or fading any more.   Hope you can figure something like that for your Snow Cat.  Good Luck.
The Bombi will never be the same…..truer words have never been spoken.
Saw where you were working the bottom half looks good  But it's bit narrow I go to edge of side and just cut both sides and then extend sides out to get better seating   That way you don't mess with window and  add a few feet length that gives you engine room for radiator and back seat   I mean you go in winter your wearing thick gear you want room
I would love to see an electrical drivetrain with the engine just as a generator. i think it would have real benifits as well, like the independent direction of the tracks and torque from standstill for accelerating real fast (pulling with ropes). also no overheating on the transmission and maybe a diesel engine for fuel not getting bad when not in use for a long time
Happy belated Tom!
7:22 - If Matt's dropping a hint sipping on a rando V8 can (never noticed him with one before), it looks like The Bombi is also getting a V8!
Happy Birthday, Tom!
That thing was completely, and I mean COMPLETELY rebuilt in my uncle's garage in his spare time while bringing the internet to Kanab. They used it up at blow hard for years with no problems. It's not Kindig quality but you guys are being a little harsh on the builder. He's an automotive genius actually
Honestly the bombi is so cute, but it’s much cuter without tracks, just tires
That particular 4.3 is bad for the distributor drive gear. They will get so worn, like razor sharp edges.  It will make the timing dance all over the place. And it will throw a camshaft, crankshaft correlation  code.
Its not a bombadere. It is pronounced "bomb bar de a.  Bombardier
I love you too sweetheart ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Lizzy
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Hear me out. Put a Cherokee body on the bombi?
I don’t know what the hell was in Tom’s lobster, but I want some 😂
Cute ending I was wondering about the spud truck.
What happened to Tucker? Did he leave ??
As long as you make room for Peanut I'll be happy.
Take the fuel tank and battery out from under the vehicle and put them in the back its dangerous upgrade the fuel tank on the morvair to over 26 gallons
Happy birthday Tom
I vote for an LS swap! 😎👍
That's a lot of negatives, but that was fun. Matt reminds me of my friend who has worked for one company for over thirty years and all his co-workers like him.  That spool of track running downhill was pretty good. Lucky shot. Peanut balances. These are so well done. Give the photographers a raise. I know, that's an awful suggestion. You aren't making that much money. When I was a kid, some of the neighbors glommed onto Weasels.  We lived next to an army base in Alaska. It was Alaska. Smart guys who could do stuff in the cold. Before global warming. Whoops, Climate Change.
just put Trax on the heavy wrecker!!
Love the reminiscing on old jobs. Love the Bombi too! Good to see her.
CLUTCH FAN, CLUTCH FAN, CLUTCH FAN
What ever happened to your other 2 dogs?? Did you finally run them over???
That thing seems like a yellow dumpster fire. Matt named off a lot of cons
Put the Astro Van body on it.
офигенный ролик
When did the Bombi get a rear door?  I'm pretty sure that the videos always showed people squeezing through the front seats to get in back.
My 3 best birthdays in chronological order 1. The day I was out processing from my unit in Italy (loved my unit, loved Italy but it was time to go) I was so busy in the process I totally forgot it was my birthday until the day was almost done. 2. The night my little sister beat the crap out of some foolish chick at a night club, while celebrating my birthday, who thought she could bully my sister, my sister is feminine as feminine gets, that is until she has to fight then she fights like she was raised with 7 Brothers which she was. 3. My eldest son recently bought me a birthday cake that read "HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD.....die already" 😂🎉😅 we share the same humor.
Happy to see some Bombi love!  She's served you well and deserves some attention
1:10 just killed me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is the submarines build quality before tested. XD
Hi. Love the show. Just a suggestions, look at the steering for the M113 apc. It has disck brake steering, and stick steering.   Used to drive the thing for the Norwegian Army, back in the day. I hate the thing 😂  Again, love the show.
Matt.   Keep your day job!       And I'm excited for this build!
Happy Birthday Tom!
You guys are engineers and world class mechanics at the same time.  So much talent.  Fun to watch you think things through and make them happen.
U guys should do what HOONIGAN does and throw some of those take offs on a MORR Ebay page
Happy Birthday Tom!!!  I hope you had an awesome day.
Happy birthday to both Tom and the Bombi. Its about time the Bombi had a birthday... cant wait to see what gets done...
I wonder if the skylight is an escape hatch in case you get buried by avalanche
woooow
My question is why the hell do you have so many grinders 😂
Get the EcoTec3 4.3 with multi port injection and lose that throttle body injected 4.3. It's way smoother and gobs more HP/TQ. Just make sure to do the displacement on demand delete.
The flagpole was in Holman, Indiana.
I know you're jealous that Canadians invented this vehicle But the east coast of Canada is rough
Diesel power time!!!
Happy birthday Tom!
Thanks for the video can’t wait to see it finished
You all also need a bigger shop lol
Why not ditch the trans put on a hydro pump and dual hydrostatic axles?
You guys need to trade this deal in for a rip saw!!!!!!
My dad's 1974 John Deere 450C steers like that
Looks like a candidate for the chev 4.8 or 5.3 V8 ;) Also like the hydrostatic drive system being suggested. My only question about that for those in the know with skid steers….do they have a high and low speed range? Seems the benefit of a traditional engine - 4 spd trans system is a wide speed band…1st for tugging and 4th for long distance runs over wide open terrain.
This Bombi is going to be a whole lot better.
Actually, forget about the Kässbohrer. After watching the BOMBIE’S achievements and struggles it HAS to be brought back. I cannot wait to see its New Found Glory
I know its a restoshow, but really? Buy a Kässbohrer Pistenbully.😊
Why not buying 44"-52" snow tires for one of your trucks? But I'm looking forward for new building video.
Put two CVTs (those ATV ones with a belt) in this thing - one per track -  and use forks on the pulleys which adjust the ratios. This way you don't lose power if you steer, you actually gain power – as the slowing track's energy is recouped and the engine power goes still fully to both tracks.  Then connect the ratio changing forks to a steering wheel. So center is 50% and 50% of the ratio and completely to one side disengages the engine on the side, by pulling the pully fully out.  Then install a split brake pedal, so you can slow the disengages track down, if it's "rolling".  Then throw out the gearbox and replace it with a CVT as well, plus a rpm governor on the engine. So you set it to a given power output and the CVT adjusts the ratio, depending on the load you throw at it.  You can then put a maximum speed pedal on the floor or a speed lever somewhere and this would limit the travel of the CVT. So if there's tough terrain the CVT would adjust down, to not overload the engine, but if the terrain gets easy the speed pedal would limit how fast the vehicle can go.  If you think one CVT may be a bit overpowered by the engine, just put two side by side for the "gearbox" part, as the steering CVTs will also share the load evenly.   In the end, you'll just need a real gearbox to add a backwards gear. So no clutch required, as the CVT will act as a clutch here.  This should be able to shave off some weight and eliminate most of the cooling needs: No band brakes, no hot gearbox.
“Peanut thinks we’re going somewhere and she doesn’t want to miss out” 🥹🥰
I think you have a bright future in the music industry
Now you just need a 12v line back to the trailer to charge the trailer battery while driving to the job.
All that work, seems like you should just build it from scratch like you did the wrecker
Poor Spud Truck, back burner but love the Bombi!
That outro was worth gold!!
Even though it will be good content you really would be better off buying a new one.
Sherp should give Matt a vehicle to test for the winter...
I hope your going to use a CATERPILLAR or a Cummins engine with some real power 😊😊
Need some of those folding jump seats, like in a helicopter, for more space in the back.
Would you be able to slam the guts from a skid steer (track motors, pumps, controls, etc) into it and go with that?
Peanut stold the show when she balance beam walked along the front of the bombie once she realized that there wasn’t going to be a ride. Amazing confident sure footed pup!
You should fit a GM van body too the chassis. More user friendly in n out warm & quiet w/all the options you want.
Ha Ha... I really laughed hard there at the end when ol blue was slinking back to it's hole.  Ha ha ha.
If it was me i would add at least the foot to the cab,  extended it rearward.  If that were mine i would make it 2 ft.   You can always modify your cargo box.  Yes I would find a better place for the battery Someplace more accessible,  you can always go with double O battery cables.  Your talking about putting a winch on there how about an air system,   your front bumper could be an air tank.  You know what you need to get done,   i can't wait to see it happen.      Larry
Happy birthday Tom
Just set it on fire and call the insurance company
I wouldn't let you hook that pos up to my rig. Things a liability
JUNK!!!!!
Matt you need to get anti gravity batteries instead 😉 they’re extremely light and they pack a punch
steers like an Argo - badly
Where’s trevor
Put a corvair body on it?
I think i just seen $100g plus disappear 😅
Have you seen the sherp 4x4
I approve the name choice.
add in two or more semi alternators for more power (not cheap) but with them, some engine power and fuel would make it where you could burn the winches out and not run out of battery.
I'd put some hydrostatic or hydraulic drive in it, diesel engine, new stronger tracks with bigger wheels
Happy Birthday Tom
Yes finally the Bomb Bee!!! B-day Tom Tom
What happened to Lizzy? We LOVE Lizzy!!!! We miss Lizzy!!!!!
All I can say is.....1964 Ford Falcon Club Wagon Snowcat!!  Make a Morvair Snow Cat!!
But what have you done lately
cant wait to see that in action. make shure to include us in the building process too! excited for it. maybe you can figure out how to install a hydrostatic drive with the engine powering the pump.
Corvair van body swap
put a lithium batteries save you about 15lbs
Im excited for this one!
the sunroof hatch is a hatch incase you drop into a deep snowdrift bro.... escape hatch lol
Ed is such a nice guy, always smiling. Could someone start a gofundme for some hearing aids for him? I'd donate to it. I just spent a weekend at a family reunion where one of the older guys was missing so much because of hearing loss. That has to be heartbreaking.
You only got as far as the skylight bit before I clicked 'like'...
5:26 i felt that 😂
Happy belated B-day Tom !
LS swap incoming!
What trans is in the bombi ??
Nice stories.
Hello From Wisconsin!!!! the classic tongue to the pole
One of the problem with the Bombi over heating could come from the fact that, as it can be seen at 6:00 the top of the radiator cap where you bleed the circuit is lower than the top coolant hose, air might get trapped at the highest point of the hose, not helping with bleeding/cooling.
I am pretty stoked to see what you do for the engine and trans. This is the only time I will say a gasser is a better choice. My vote is an LSX coupled to a TH400.
Go get a Ram Mega Cab “cab”  and replace the Bombi cab with that! Fixes many thing in one shot!!
11:14😍
Hollie was in a  car accident
I can't wait to see the improved Bombi! That ending was perfect as I was just wondering what/how does building the big blue truck (with those 3 MRAP axles?) fit into all this also🙂
24:58😂
Are you going to put an LS in it?
Happy bday Tom, mine was today
Happy birthday Tom
Hey guy,s love your chanel the sun roof is suppose to be a escape hatch and I think it would be cool to have floodlights  360 and some search light,s and some winches and some tool boxs ,snow shovel  and chain saw storage just thinking out loud can you tell I live in Michigan LOL😅😅 PS MAY BE SOME SKIS  FOR THE OLD CAR TRAILER 😅
Matt has a nice singing voice!
Not trying to be nit picky but you called them axles.. My point is and me being in the Army for 23 years and was in a tracked vehicle. Just to let you know and you probably already know and probably just misspoke a tracked vehicle runs on torsion bars. I still love everything thing that you guys do. keep the content coming.
Skid Steers and Bob Cats have a motor the runs a hydrostatic drive. That may work better than an engine, transmission, break system.
Escape hatch..so when u fall threw the ice u can climb out...????
I think  1969 Chevy van body would look great on the Bombi.
You should convert it over to a hydraulically driven final drive used in a large track loader or skid steer
Going to build a whole new vehicle at that point
Get a Sherp instead.
Just get a tucker snow cat and get it over with...
Wow I really hope Red lobster is better in your state than it is in Ohio because in Ohio Red lobster sucks
If it has that topic spider fuel injection under the intake fuel injection system than that would explain it
Love it! About time the bombi gets some more  work done. I'm excited about the rebuild and I loved the blue truck in the background 'all by itself' because it's getting pushed back on the list, or is it?
Happy Birthday Tom🎉
Great seeing ED . My suggestion is a Greenbrier Van body .
Add a front and rear winch
The outro was priceless!! 😂😂
Toms humor in these videos is great !
🎈🎉🎉🎶Today is such a special one! It's birthday time for you!!!🎶🎈🎉🎉🎂🎂🎂
the 4.3 has issue with plastic fuel lines!!!
OK ...uhm, can I just say one thing Matt? OK maybe two, #1 don't quit your day job. #2 is a question, what did you do with the money???
guess ya just need to drop 300k on a ripsaw!
Lol at the end blue truck! Thats awesome to upgrade Bombi! Look forward to your rebuilding it. By the way happy birthday Tom!
ok, that's too much fun
Why not make the rear box out of aluminum?
3:48 - Matt and Tom Tom went full Oprah mode. "You get an upgrade, you get an upgrade, everyone gets an UPGRADE"
Happy Birthday Tom!!!
Get 4 Fiero seats.
MATT AND CREW! I HAVE THE BEST IDEA! ONE TO GROW THE CHANNEL SOME JUST BASED ON THE IDEA LOL! BUT ALSO FOR YOU TO TEST YOUR GRIT AND HAVE THE BEST TIME EVER!   You need you hook up with the Australian channel 4wd 24/7...  some of the routes they take in their fun would surely test you! Plus they do in the moment recoveries to get through some of the hardest courses! Just check it out and think on it! The collaboration we need!!! Need to get the morvair suited with a snorkel and camper tent top for the occasion! Your best adventure ever! To skip past this without thinking about it! It's a crazy idea but my goodness it would be the best YouTube video ever in this genre!
Just an idea, to go along with the Corvair theme, a corvair greenbrier van with tracks would be cool.
Classic "upgrades", pretty much building whole new vehicle and just putting the old body back on :P Can't wait!
The freaking edit with Matt at the end killed me.
I’m picturing setting an XJ body onto the Bombi chassis OR putting tracks on an XJ.
🌟🌞☀🌞🌟
Looking forward of seeing  the evolution of the bombi
If you're taking about lights, I've purchased some diode dynamics led lights, us made, reasonably priced, good and water proof (road tested at least)
You're not kidding about Wisconsin. It's that cold.
Everyone talking about the Bombi, and I'm here like, "When is the Matt-MORR Single getting released."
We’ll probably fix that. Fuel gauge working 😂
Hey Matt, obviously the Bambi is a special vehicle for you guys. But if you ever need to get another tracked vehicle, have a look at Hägglunds BV206. They're not the fastest vehicles around, but they sure like snow and mud! Also, Happy Birthday Tom!
She sounded like Dora the explorer! “We did it!”
Happy birthday Tom!
Tom looks a lot better with a beard. I feel off the MORR wagon sometime during the off-road wrecker build so it's like Tom's beard magically appeared. I will eventually go back and watch the ORW build, but this is a cool and exciting project. Hopefully it doesn't take as long as the ORW.
In rebuilding  this 'chariot', I can see the 4.3 lt. Vortec coupled to either the 6L90. or 8L90 Transmission, your steering issues can be fixed by using Disc brakes between the differential and final drive assembly similar to military track vehicles... cooling set up could place the radiator between the passenger compartment and cargo cage, or horizontally above the engine, between engine and cargo cage. the bogie/suspension wheels can be alleviated by using the rear axles from the Chrysler/Dodge line of mini vans, [they'll bolt directly to a length of Uni-Strut] and I believe they're rated at about 3600 lbs. the tensioner wheels are a matter of threaded or grease.
Time out. What the heck did he drain at 8:55? That fluid looks like nothing that should come out of a vehicle.
You people amaze me with the way you come up with all these rebuild ideas
im watching a year old video of lexus with Trevor   I miss him
The best outro so far.
Happy Birthday   Tom
Bsf had that kid up in Mn with a hell of a setup on one. Hope u saw it and maybe took some notes.. looked like a stout setup
That outro was pretty incredible. The sad potato truck. Matt's ghostly yet angelic singing. I definitely shed a tear.
You should put pedal steer with heavily upgraded hydraulic brakes. Get those levers out of the way. Put a nice large heater in their place 😊
Happy birthday Tom! Keep up the great videos!
Happy birthday Tom!!🎉
Those 4.3l are known for worn out distributors
There U go ! The best of Canadian Engineering !! 😂
I don’t know about anybody else, but I am really looking forward to the BOMBI  —TRANSFORMATION …
Kick the 4.3 V6 and get the 4.8/5.3 V8 easy to find in a junkyard so parts sourcing easy. I would suggest holley efi and digital dash with select mechanical of gauges. PRP seats in banana yellow and look into TBM brakes as look what cleetus did to them.
Happy birthday tom
Matt when does the tour start for your new album?
When Matt needs a haircut, he looks like Hopper from Stranger Things!
Tom, you just made my morning with your comment about part numbers and birthday ties.
Those limb lopper brake levers are killing me.🤣
Put a corvar body on it please that would be so cool and unique
Would love to have a snow cat .I need a job
Wooohooooo!! So excited for this build. Oh and happy birthday to Tom 😊
So it's the Morrbee?
In the future, they’d announce that all their vehicles can combine into a giant robot… Power Ranger style.
I missed seeing the Bombi this past winter. This should be an exciting project, can’t wait.
Happy birthday TomTom🎉
I think a mild rollbar of some sort would be prudent also, anyone else?  Either interior bar or exo.
Will it get a diesel Engine
Hi the Bombi will be cooler when it is done
5:30- funniest thing Tom Tom has said to date.  I feel you brother!!! 😁😁🤣
i need those batteries , i just traded my 96 f 150 for a 97 c30 dually my lexus lx470 also uses a big battery . I like that potatoe truck you guys got i grew up with a 69 c20 my great mother bought brand new and also had a 64 nova we had to sell 2005 while my fathers company was on strike we sold it to celebrate christmas and thanksgiving , had no idea the bambi ran off a vortec motor
Lol nobody wonders if Rory does quality work 😂!
The 4.3 is one of the best V6's ever produced I think. Low maintenance and lasts a long time.  Overheated is killer for any engine. If it has a distributor the shafts sometimes wore out and the rotors and caps caused some problems like you mentioned.
That ending... chef's kiss 🤌
Happy Birthday Tom!!
Why does Matt bother buying equipment? If he's just going to make it better😂 my man just did a cooler bombie than the engineers  that designed it, he should just buy a shell like the wrecker.
Oh man… when the tracks come off it looks so sad 😞
The outro was great. I literally laughed out loud!
So is the 'killer bee' goin' to get a flat six w/a 'vair transaxel ? No more 'coolant' issues - just sayin' :)
Happy B-day tom enjoy
Happy birthday Tom
One of the things I absolutely love, being a sound guy myself, is when Matt is describing something with sound fx !!!  I can't give ya'll enough props for how you run your channel .... thanks so much
Happy birthday Tom
Idea, may seem crazy but hear me out ... snowcat wrecker ...
Isn't Robbie also rebuilding his Sno-Cat? Hmm, time for Tracked Winter Olympics?
I keep saying just build the corvair greenbrier van as your new tracked bombi.
I am excited to see the bomb bee improved. good luck to you.
"If you want a guy that does quality work, this guy says he does." 🤣🤣
U putting an LS in it for motor.  Saw one on Robbie’s channel. Fit. Was awesome
This is gonna be good.
Great episode. Can’t wait to see the rebuilt bombi. Nice to hear Colby or whoever was behind the camera commenting as well. Makes it seem like a more real
Was just thinking......how long has it been since you took lizzie clothes shopping? Im sure she has tears she isn't telling you about. Time to do some recoveries in the mall parking lot lol
Happy Birthday Tom
I've spent some time operating snowcats at ski resorts and I love and look forward to seeing your snowcat recoveries. However, I can't help but cringe at the sound of you guys putting brand new tracks on your bombi to take it into terrain of the not so white varieties. 😢
Wifey is hot
id also add a remote mount oil filter, and an oil cooler with its own fan
need to switch to the marine intake , an msd distributor, doubble roller pre streched timing set, billet cover, and the aftermarket chain tensioner kit, and swap out the 4l60 for a 4l80 or 6l90
Yeah, wearing cowboy boots in snow in ice 😮 Probably not going to end well 😂
The ending with the spud truck is PriceLess
HaPpY bIrThDaY Tom! I totally “get” why you don’t make a big deal. Same thing here for same reasons.
Matt the end of the video is really cool. It got a good chuckle out of me and hey I don't find most things funny. I saw the truck just sitting in the corner of the fence. I thought okay but then it moved and I thought okay  but then you started singing and the rain and lightning it was all classic.
Poor use of dynamic rope
You need to get the brake based turn out of there
You need to reverse engineer a skid steer control system into Bombi.
I sing "All by myself" aloud to people at work sometimes.  LOL!  I get it!
I hope the Bombi hasn't already been relegated to the back lot.   Incredible to see you guys planning to beef it up so it can handle a winter rescue.
Matt, you have so much you need to work on with the boom-b. It's going to take up precious room in your shop. You should send it out to someone because you are going to need to fix one of your other rigs before you can get the boom-b fixed. Look at how hard it was for you to get the wrecker built. At least the boom-b was made by someone else and not pure fabrication like the wrecker. Yes it would be expensive but worth it.
8:43 I see the problem. It's full of peanut sauce....mmmm peanut sauce.
Happy Birthday Tom
I'm allergic to bees, and I had to jab my leg with the EPI pen just to watch this video.  That's loyalty 💯💯
Upgrayedd... For a double dose of your fabrication hand
Tom Tom, on that fuel gage, does fixing it mean it actually works or that Matt will guess every time he gets in it?
Need to find a 50s or 60s COE body and use that for front cab then fabricobble a super crew cab on back. Need LS swap with nv2500 trans and dual caliber discs for steering.  Good luck can't wait to see what y'all come up with.   Thanks for sharing y'all's talents and adventures
On the 4.3 I would say your spider injection is cracked.
The Bombi has definitely leveled up after today's mind-blowing transformation!
Do you know why j. arnold bombardier made these things?   Because his son was sufferening from a disease that he unfortunately succumbed to, and he could not get to the hospital because of the snow.   So now skidoo's exists.  As well as the snow cats.  And jets etc are manufactured because of that particular tragedy.  Random canadian fact there.  Cheers.  Hope everyone is taking care.
Should really build a corvair on track , just throwing that idea out there 🎉
Very cool
Poor blue at the end lmao!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy Birthday and can’t wait to see this build. !
Happy birthday Tom. Didn’t get your list of part numbers. But I didn’t get you a tie either. Matt have you ever thought of making the bombi diesel? Merlin could help!
I always assumed it was built like a Caterpillar. Clutch and stick break for hard turns.
Bigger motor.
A fire phoenix..........gonna burn the shop down to get out! Just kidding man, you can't trap a fire phoenix. ~ Tom Cruise, probably,
That thing needs a ford 300 engine
Have you considered adding a front “ski” steering axle for travel.  Maybe something that raises up against the cab front?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM
LOL, freezing to a flag pole in winter in Wisconsin. As a Wisconsite, I can vouch for Matt about our terrible winter conditions.
Why do you need two batteries
Happy Belated Birthday Tom Tom. Matt and the crew y'all are going too make a Awesome  snowcat and I like the ending old blue crying
The ONE vehicle that Matt HATES....................is the only one with a working fuel gauge🤣😂 .
This is one of your best videos.  But don't forget Tom and Lizzy who support you so well.
Hey Tom, Happy B-lated Birfhday 😎 I jus wanted to drop inn to say hi and let you know your doing an awesome job Matt and team keep it going 🤙🏾🤙🏾💯
*H A P P Y   B I R T H D A Y !*
Yall are getting  to silly.
Always good to see Ed!
Great video as always, the ending really cracked me up 😂😂
Two thoughts: ditch the basket and put a boom on it. Wouldn't that help get vehicles on top of the snow? Second, what direction is your rad fan blowing? In those replay, it looked like it was blowing out. Would it be better to pull air in? Or was that just the way it looked on film?
Always love what you all are doing with your channel. Sorry to ask a question about a different vehicle. In the Banana you use limited slip diffs. Why limited slip vs lockable (like air lockers), is it because they are sometimes difficult to unlock in the moment without reversing or you don't see a marked benefit for them in your application? (like cost to performance)?
24:29 the ashes of a phoenix bird
The end of the video! That was gut splitting funny!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
You should install a (skid loader) style drive system. With the fuel and all engine systems separate from the cab.
First bombi recovery was when you and casey were on good terms. You credited him in a video for starting you on youtube. He doesn't hesitate to take a poke at you though.
You need a Maybach double differential with a hydrostatic steering input.  Caterpillar did this for the old Cat Challenger tractors and the swash plate in the hy-stat was connected to a traditional steering wheel.  The result is track drive with differential steering, but you just drive it like a car.  Only drawback was that the turn radius was tied to the forward speed.  Going fast, turning the steering wheel all the way to the lock resulted in a wide turn radius, but at slower speeds it resulted in a tighter turning radius.  If you were stopped and turned the steering wheel, it would turn in place.  (with rubber tracks, this resulted in a lot of hopping and shaking.)  On snow, you would probably just dig rather than turning in place.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you do it is great.  Turn the steering wheel a little, and one track slows down a little and the other speeds up a little.
So Killa B should be ready in the spring but is still gonna do a whole winter's worth of work, right?
I've been waiting years for this! I'm sure you'll come up with something awesome. Was that thing originally built just to shuttle people around or was it for some kind of utility/recovery job?
I see all of these comments that people are liking the story time, however I am on the other side. I found it boring and would rather see more hands on work on the Bombi vs content repeat and time filler.
I’m sure they’re good batteries and necessary but it’s always surprised me that you don’t have the engine running when winching, a first principle when I learned recoveries.
Two seats facing each other in the rear would make a lot of sense.
Looking forward to seeing the final product. Love the outro too!
What if they put the monster axles in Tom’s dig dug? 🧐
I understand an automatic transmission in a rock crawler, but I would not have one. What I really cannot understand is why you would put one in the Bomb-Bee. Why not put a  T56 Super Magnum 6 Speed or a Tremec TKX 5-speed manual in it. I do not believe that an automatic is more durable like some say. Have had both and the standard is more reliable by far with a veteran behind the pedal.
I that's a good choice though because you guys can jam this out in time for snow season you'll have the whole winter for the old blue!!
I think those big bulky pickup truck seats are taking up lots of interior real estate. Go with slimline seats, and there will be more room.
Need to get tracks for the off-road wrecker to make it like one of those big tucker snow machines
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!! The Bombi will rise from it's own ashes. It deserves the best because it gave it all to recoveries while seriously wounded and still accomplished the missions...Got 'em Out!! Don't know about the ending song though.
I have to stop watching this every time Matt starts a sentence dumb dumb finishes it very annoying
Excited the bombi is the next project!
That ending though! 🤣
You need to come to New England red lobster can’t even make it here cause local seafood beats them every single time
Wouldn’t it have been much easier to see you’re doing a 100% rebuild
There is a new camera out there that you should get for you crew. Its a Hover X1 you need to check it out.
Ah purceeyate dis
Happy Birthday Tom Tom, have a blessed day. Don’t over do it at Red Lobster, lol.
Well, ripsaw has air cooled disk brakes, so are you going that way?  That rad looks way too small, I wonder why they chose it, just the hole size in the back?
Yay! This is one of the top projects, that I've been hoping and truly waiting to see!! I love this machine
It was great seeing Lizzy and Ed!
"You give them part numbers and you get a tie" HAHAHA
I was wondering if you were ever going to start a winter season with the Bombi ready to go.
Happy birthday, Tom Tom!! Love seeing the Bombi get some love, that is a cool little machine for sure!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom🎉🎉🎉🎉
I upped my battery game. Up yours!
I think that it needs an LS
It steers like an Argo 2
you guys should get a set of trax for the movair or the banana
I loved the end of the episode with the spud truck and matt singing haha
Bro it's just a 2002 blazer lmao (I drive an Astro van with the 4.3 haha)
Seems to me that hydraulic drive motors from a skid steer or other agricultural / construction equipment could be McGyvered to work in this application which would do away with the "brake steer" system currently in place.  Of course, hydraulics are expensive and bring their own set of issues - especially in cold weather.
That was fun reminiscing about the Bombi with Lizzy and Matt.
You definitely need to relocate the battery for easier access!😊
This looks like a fun build! Hey Matt, I like V8 too! LOL Must be our age.
Happy Birthday Tom!
That's a milkshake machine.
I am always fascinated at how you take something like this, lift the body, replace everything underneath and make it better.  Looking forward to the finished product.
You need a second channel where Matt sings Karaoke classics!
The ending clip had me rolling lol
Poor Spud truck 😂😂
Can’t wait to see the upcoming videos. And just a suggestion by an avid viewer, you should invest in some mics for those that need to be heard.
At a certain point, you have to ask whether you ought to just build a new one and strip the old one for usable parts and pieces. That point is here, by the way.
I'm sure you have it planned out, but why not use a diesel and hydros from a small/medium 2 speed skid steer.  Simple, forward and reverse with both tracks without shifting and you won't be sitting on a bomb of a gas tank.
I had a 4.3 vortec on a 2002 s10 fun lil truck
Tracks looked cool when you were takin them off. You should put 40’s on it with the tracks.
What Kind of an Awesome drink is that V8 ??? Imagine V8 on a can. I need that Stuff here in Switzerland 😊
Coudlnt agree more with Tom about birthday gifts haha!
Before the snow flies?  I'll have to chase down my camping trip photos over the 4th of July a decade ago... not 40 miles from you 3 inches of snow. Was completely melted by sunrise. ;)
that ending was hilarious
The BombleBee?
Happy Birthday Tom!
Kind of curious why you wouldn't just get some sort of side x side with tracks? I would imagine it would be easier to repair.
Best upgrade so far has been TomTom.  Fun to watch an engineer be surprised on the shade tree engineering, that seem to work for the applications. Look for TomTom 's patent on cardboard CAD!
Great trip down memory lane
Happy birthday Tom!
"We are going to replace... everything"   So as near as I can tell you could buy a newer unit and swap windshields and be about even in the game!
IO just want to commend you for working on one of my favorite vehicles, BEFORE WINTER.....!
This whole vid was hilarious. Give a free car to your video editor person!
Lizzy is SO beautiful……
Tom that "you give them part numbers, you open it up and it's a tie," I feel that!
Can’t wait to see how the Bombi turns out. Definitely long overdue for a rebuild. Good luck guys. We’ll be watching. 😎👍
Happy Birthday Tie Tom!
That outro was EPIC! 😂😂😂
WOW, the forbidden smoothie @ 8:43
HBD Tom Tom!!!! I hate my birthday for the same reason. I also hate all the hullabaloo people do for me. I don’t deserve it!
Happy birthday Tom hope you have a great day
Does it make sense to pull the drive train from an old skid steer to swap into the Bombi? Maybe it’ll be easier than continuously cobbling everything together…
Since you have it completely apart and you are doing so much anyway, wouldnt it be a good time to transition it to full hydraulic propulsion (like a skidsteer)?  That way you dont have to deal with hot brakes and no steering?
Hello un heureux anniversaire pour TOM, que je trouve compétant et sympathique.
Happy birthday Tom!  Also where has Tucker been?  Always fun watching all your videos!
Happy birthday Tom
Happy birthday tom
Go Killer Bee ! Need a SEABEE "BEEP" sticker on it.  Matt in the recording booth was hillarious, even though he carried it.
Happy Birthday Tom!!! The Bombi project is past due but I had to chuckle at the poor, neglected blue truck project at the end.
I think the seat in the back is 100% NEEDED!  Happy Birthday TOM!
Great outro!
Please get a tucker snow cat and restore it would be an awesome series after fixing the bombi.
Actually looking forward to follow this build...
A friend of mine in Rollinsville, CO has one of those "Tuckers" (I think that's what you called it). My friend's is on his dad's property behind the old schoolhouse at the top left of town, tucked back in the trees (not sure you can see it from the fence). My friend's has skis in the front, and tracks in the back. They got it as a project, but admittedly won't ever rebuild it. It's cool as hell, but needs lots of work to get it running again.  Adler is their last name in case you want to attempt to buy it.
Happy Birthday Tom!
Might you consider fabricating a snow plow attachment for Bombi… might be helpful in some recovery situations?
Glad to see you guys are able to pause and do the necessary things to benefit you and your customers for the long term.  You can only run on luck for so long. 😆 Poor spud truck...
If you didn't watch til the end, you missed the best thing I have seen since fall count 4 clip...🎙🎙🎙🎧🚚😩
Happy birthday..Tom..
you should make up with casey. Thats been a while ago and you two worked great together.
FINALLY the Bombi get's some love! So happy to see this!
Put a Diesel in it!
Hi Mat. nice to see you upgrading your little bombi. It whould be nice to have more legroom at the back. maybe move the engine back a little and cut the back out to move the seat back. Regards, Stephen from South Africa.
What day is his mine is the 25th of June
Hahaha i was wondering about the spud truck and you guys threw it in the end.
I am totally excited for the build of the bombi. Very much enjoyed all previous builds but I think that this one is going to be my favorite
Never have a battery under a passenger, if it decides to short and explode the seat nor human flesh will not stop it.
Great Bombi vid. Happy Birthday Tom.
you give them part numbers haha
What front end is in it we used spat front ends from personnel carriers in full track in the Everglades. Those bands can be upgraded. Would need to see yours to see if we could help u upgrade those.
I wonder from time to time if you charge for recoveries? and if you do how in the world do you figure out the cost to charge people. I'm guessing on some recoveries the charge could be in the thousands.
What if you put a new body on the Bombi, something like a minivan body with a short nose? you'll get the comfort, ease of access, maybe fit some of the accessorial of the engine up front in the engine bay for easier access (the radiator, batteries etc.)
You could extend the cab to surround the engine and then put a dog house around the engine like vans and humvees have. They will add two more seats and the cab will get warmer, then put a luggage rack on the roof
Why not make it a hydro-matic off a bob cat?
Happy Bday belated Tom!
Matt, just say it, we are going to build a brand new Bombi 😂
at some point, you're just better off building a new vehicle from scratch.
Def show everything U upgrade and do to BOMBI! So looking forward to this video(s)!! Can’t wait to see the new KILLER B!!!
For some reason, I'm really, REALLY, excited about these upgrades!
Fit external jump point for battery
Can’t wait to see the end result!!!  Also, Happy Birthday Tom!!!
that ending 😂 are you SURE you aren’t James from donut media’s dad?? i joke, but really looking forward to the bombi’s glow up! i know you and the gang will not fail.
Just install a jeep body on the Bombi 😜😂
You  should  definitely  get a corsair  body for that frame or  something of the like.
Quality video, enjoyed this one, but then I enjoy pretty much all of them anyway :)
Sounds like you need a joy-stick controller like a Kubota skidsteer loader 🙃
Yay the Bombi 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Glad the bombi is getting some love- the ending was halarious 🙂
A gas filler inside the cab is a terrible idea, gas fumes and smell and fire danger
I would love to see this one ,Just a sugestion.. whats the possibillity of installing a boom with a winch at the back like you did on the wrecker?
Transplant on the body of a Jeep Cherokee on to the chassis.
Hi guys,  I just saw the bombi video, just a suggestion, it would be cool if would do like two bench seats on each side in the rear, instead the traditional front facing bench!
Matt: "It works." TomTom: "Well, we will probably fix that."  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Bombi is awesome... BUT PLEASE BUY A TUCKER! yea!
That outro was the best thing ever 😂
I don’t want this to sound negative but I’m wondering why not do what Casey LaDelle did and put tracks on a Jeep. Only wondering cause this looks like a full rebuild but will watch and enjoy the journey regardless.
Get this little beast a 750bhp Hemi. And it will never let you down
the truck backing away was priceless
How long do you think this build will take?
8:50 Same color when the dog is ill 🤣
Hydrostatic steering & drives like from a skidsteer, simple to operate & get parts, less "stuff" to have under the floor.  with the wire cargo box gone, extend the cab length for more legroom & make a smaller equipment cargo box (ropes & shackles etc & spare gas can holder, dual radiators on each side, easy access track adjustments for on the job adjustments. LED lighting, dual batteries with high output alternator for winching & 360° flood lights for night jobs. Front & rear pintle hooks for the kinetic ropes. Hydrostatic steering likely would be lighter than those dual steering brakes & oil baths etc... & much less drag instead of resisting the drive motion & instant steering
why don't you buy a new for you one, a max10 years old ?
Goodonya Matt i dig the show its suprizingly entertaining you have a great crew. I love the videos all the best to you and yours Mate👍🇦🇺👍
Hey Matt, Tom Tom, Joshua tree , Genus Yucca species brevifolia, a lovely fragrant efflorescence especially after good rains. The tree stores moisture for many years without anymore than 150mm=6 inches of annual rain . Used extensively in landscapes and in Religious sanctuary for the metaphoric  resurrection message . Aussie Rob -Hort Science
Sell it off and by a decent one
So you're using the same body or maybe do a body swap from a small car?? Maybe a 5 door suzuki vitara/tracker could do the job?
Will they add a radiator for heating inside for winter ? I didn't see one
Happy Birthday TOM
Omg the ending where Matt is singing is ✨GOLDEN✨
I have a feelingen... Cummins swap? 😎😅
... did anybody else wonder when Tom said they had to "Fix" the fuel gauge... if he meant "make it so it does NOT go up and down with fuel level" ???
Call the bombie the morrbee
Can't wait to see the upgraded Bombi .I know t will be just awesome
Hahahaha.  Part numbers?  Thats my son in his 200SX that likes to go sideways around bends.
Bombie is a popular offroading area in British Columbia
A vw kombi would make a awesome cab over that
98% of the Worlds countries and and 96% of the Worlds population doesn't have a clue what a Mile is or what a Fahrenheit is  -- METRIC PLEASE
Happy birthday Tom!!!   Tom
METRIC PLEASE
I am only 7 minutes into the video and my opinion is you should just build one from scratch after seeing how you built the Worlds Largest Off Road Wrecker.
Happy birthday, Tom!!!!
Today is your birthday and I am praying that God will take care  of all your needs, touch your life with joy and contentment, bless your heart with love and faith, comfort your soul with inner peace, and grant you good health now and always.  Hapi beerday Tomtom!
YES!! Fixing the Bombi 🤓❤️
You need tbm brakes from Cleetus.
Happy Birthday.
Make a new box out of aluminum…they make that expanded metal out of aluminum also and it’s not as sharp. Powder coating it will also hep with the sharpness.
SLIPLOCK!!!!!??????... IN THE BOMBI!?!!?!!!????? LORD SAVE THE POOR BOMBADIER. No but for real, i have no effin idea what plans for mobility modifications you are cooking up for that thing. But if you give it like a foot of suspension lift and new tracks to boot, that thing will be unstoppable.  JUST THINK... if you make it able to clear 31's then you would still be pretty darn mobile if you broke the tracks and had to strip them off while in the middle of a job. OOORRRRRRRRR... you could give it winches (which i am positive you're already going to) and build some sleds that stow on the sides and mount to the wheels/hubs/suspension so that you could winch it around on the sleds in an emergency
The crying spud truck at the end 😂
Really excited for this series. Tbh watching you two trash on the bad parts was pretty entertaining.
It has to be quite a bit of planning just to locate and get parts to your shop so you can start a build ( notice I said build not project) like this.
Spud truck might just lose its stuff, lay waste to y'all. Jus sayin! LOL!
I reckon you should used a diesel engine on one of your rigs, as a trial so you have a chance to see the ways and how they aren't so bad
Can't wait to see the build vids and finished Bombi!
Damn this turned into a flashback episode - sure was a sticky situation!
It's great to see Lizzy, I miss watching her weld.
why always install batteries next to the gas tank lol
Some ideas. 1. Kubota diesel with a hydrostatic pump. 2. Skid-steer control system from a scrap skid steer. 3. Air-Water aftercooler on the Kubota to assist in cold-weather operation.
Matt: why don’t you just put tracks on your XJ? You can swap them off, and the XJ is so light, it would probably float very well.
Buy a wrecked Tesla that way you have power through the motors and breaking and it'll wear less cuz you put more power on your separate one side and you can have a generator on the back charging if you're going long distance with no transmission to break down and they won't hear you coming nnnnnñnmn ❤
An LMC 1200 can be diagnosed by Peterson Equipment Company, a new and used snowcat dealership and repair shop, based in Hyde Park, Utah. Not to endorse per-se.
How's Ed been? Haven't seen him in awhile and been thinking about him!
"its yellow" cracked me up
I’m in wisconsin
Old blue is all sad at the end lol.
Should be a good Build Good Story’s Matt and Lizzy
Slap a 5.3 in it and let it eat, ls swap the world
@mattsoffroadrecovery.  If you want to sell that hydraulic brake cooling pump, I'm interested in purchasing it.  I have a 1980 bombi here in Alaska.
I honestly would fix the bombi up and sell it and get a newer, heavier snowcat.          You got the cashola, make it way nicer for the riders and clients you recover for.
Forth row seating 🤔
please leave tom out of the videos except to do welding or something....has the personality and humor of a rock......
🥳  🎉  🥳  🎉  🥳  Happy Happy Birthday  🎉  🥳  🎉  🥳  🎉
Hope peanut doesn't get really sick from licking the antifreeze off the side of the engine
Can we get Tom’s parts list so we can send him some birthday gifts!
TomTom deserved a better birthday video. Started off great then....storytime was painful.
Buy a sherp, put tracks on it, done 🎉😂
The bomb bee looks like it was bombed by bees, or German engineer, who says after 4 or 5 Steins: "The more complex the better" ist job insurance.
I can see that you'd want to get the Bombi up and better before the winter season. Guessing the Blue Potato will be the winter project.
As much as I despised watching the wrecker being put together over and over,  I'm looking forward to seeing the Bombi rebuild. Long time waiting. Let's gitt'r done!!!
Red Lobster was better when they had Ultimate Fondue.
Yep......Get right on it as soon as ya git around to it!
With all the viewers complaining about how Matt and crew decide on the way they fabricate their builds, I simply enjoy watching their expertise speak for itself. The best part for me is getting to guess how the list of upgrades is going to take shape. With the Banana, MORRvair and Wrecker consisting of pure ideas machined and welded into reality, the experience of this crew is something to admire.
This comment isn't about this particular episode, but it kind of bugs me when you talk about the [negative] comments other people write. You should just ignore them (as much as possible). Feel free to ignore mine.  "The comments aren't wholesome"
Also add one v8 chev
Put the fuel tank up where the rack was at the back
While you are at it, maybe you can rig up an articulating plow.  Hint hint.  One day you're going to wish you had one.
Foget it dont do it. We all love you.
Happy birthday 🎉🎁🎈 Tom have a great one 😊
I’ve watched this channel grow from day. One, I must say, the addition of Tom and his chemistry with Matt is pretty awesome!
Best content for you all is to build the world's best submersible. The world will watch, be safe.
What about using a set up like a skid steer with hydraulic motors?  It would give you so much more maneuverability and eliminate your brake issues
In my opinion you should start from the ground up.  Use pumps and wheel motors so it would have the maneuvering capability of a skid steer. Find some solid forklift wheels to run the track on.
Red lobster sucks
The fireside chat of past jobs is fun. Should consider doing some more.   Lizzy knows more skills with her hands then half the damn "men" in the world
Happy Birthday Tom Tom
I’m so excited for this build omg 😂
Question for Matt: Are you sponsored by Milestar, or do you buy the Patagonia MTs because they are low-cost?  I have a theory about why the Wrecker crawls so well. One word, Mickey Thompson.
I'll never understand why people build tracked vehicles with the drive sprockets in the front. Going forward, it applies tension to the whole track and increases wear at all the pins and bushings. Rear drive sprockets, like dozers, drive the rear sprockets for a reason - it only tensions the bottom of the track and the top doesn't see the load unless it is going backwards. I guess front mounted drives must be a concession for packaging. As to the drive upgrade - you can upgrade (bandage) the brake biased turning system with hydraulic calipers, rotors, coolers, etc, OR - IMO spend the money and swap to a hydraulic pump and rear mounted drive motor/sprockets. Much greater control - like a zero turn mower - and the ability to, well, ZERO TURN. Just make sure the track location rollers will survive the side loading.
Put Bombi in your museum and build a whole new one :)
I struggle with birthdays. I give them part numbers, I get a tie.   -Tom
Happy Birthday Tom 🎉
Happy Birthday Tom.
happy birthday to tom tom
Look I image the Bombi as a four seater now :D And a large cargo cage on top (the style of the current smaller one) . However I am not sure if this is possible due to mainly cooling system placement ane maybe transmission. Also I thought it was Bambi not Bombi :D
Put hydrostatic steering in the Bombi you won't regret it.
Sunday shop videos. Let's goooooo
You sure you don't to replace the whole body with a Corvair Greenbriar?
Put a camera man chair where the basket was😂
Hi , have you thought of the configeration for the seats to be , driver in the middle and the crew sideways down each side with their feet in the middle then you wont have to make the cab longer and you could put any motor or box in  cheers .
Paul's heavy wrecker to be just slinks back out of the picture at the end...lol
Supercharged 5.3 LS. Bombi to Ripsaw!  Lol. We'll get em out!.   Hydraulic system.  Drive motors.
Two things.  1)  This may be a dumb question(s), but why did they design that thing so the driver has to reach across their body to control it?  And have you thought about fixing that?  2) An extra kudo for whoevers idea the ending with the new/old flatbed feeling rejected. 🤣😂😅😆
The ending was great the large truck backing away
That ending was so brilliant.  The spud truck backing out of view like a sad child.  Just perfect!!!
Great episode!
Full version of matt singing all by myself when?
Get a Sisu Nasu
Happy b day, Tom
Put a 360* thermal camera in the sky light spot.
This is good, it deserves an major upgrade. Amazing it did what it did, now is the time to get it reliable, you know you're gonna need it.
Hey guys, we love the show. When I saw the bomby "frame" without the body I imagined a corvair truck sitting on top of it. It would be very fitting to the MORR fleet.
I got to say, this episode was awesome. All of it. The story time with Lizzy and Matt. The production. Matt singing! Loved it. And love you guys.
I’m excited
Looked like quiet the birthday party , back to work . Let’s build us a snow cat recovery vehicle, this should be good . Let us know if you need any helpful comments during the build :-)
what happened to Trevor and Tucker????
ha love that ending
A big yellow half track would be neat
you should do a roof rack it would probably be much lighter and still hold everything u need also would allow more more potential in the engine bay area
You'll get it running before snow for sure. But which year, nobody knows. 😂 That's all right, we'll be watching!
Matt You crack me up..
these videos get better and better!
Looks like it was made for jump seat in the back, not a bench
Hey Matt I’m selling my 00 jeep XJ, I think it would be really cool if you got it and I can see it on your videos
👍🏽🇺🇸👍🏽
I dont believe that is the original backseat, because it should fold UP to get access to the battery, filters, hoses, and wiring. The backseat in it now looks like a front automotive seat. Build a new, basic, foldup seat and then say, "NO WHINING BACK THERE!"
Don't upgrade too much to a already proven machine as it is. "Upgrade only necessary things."
Happy Birthday Tom
Diesel, diesel, diesel, diesel, diesel!
Hi Tom, I am an engineer also. I have developed a Functional Specification for Birthday Particulars. It is basically a flow chart with some instructions on why those part numbers are important. Let me know if you would like a copy.
Happy birthday TomTom!!!
Distributor cap.... I have a 2000 Chevy blazer with the same engine, and it took me forever to figure out why mine was losing cylinder contact. Turned out being the distributor cap on the inside was melting to itself. I couldn't tell by just looking at it I would say try a new distributor cap.
Happy Birthday Tom
This video is so funny! Good job guys
I have been waiting for this day along time 😊👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Lobsters in the desert?
Happy birthday Tom🎉
Snow cat wrecker Olympics 2024???
How about getting a tucker snowcat??  Dang it. You just brought up snowcats.  Lol.
Rock looks amazing
Lmao the last clip of the truck backing up 😂😂
So cool to see the Bombi get some love. She's needed it for a while.
Where’s Lizzie’s off-road vehicle?
Happy bday Tom tom!!🎉🎉
Happy birthday Tom! hope it was a great day (after fixing the Bombi). So what Bday is this? 29 - again? 😉😉😁😁
Happy Birthday Tom-Tom.  Make some room and install 2 automatic transmissions side by side, linked on the front, output goes to left and right track.  It would take ALL the pressure off the brakes.  You would have 100% pull when turning while going forward because of the difference in output speed between the two transmissions depending what gear you select for each.  You would have to do a little engineering on the Engine to Transmission connection or ask someone who knows about multi-transmission connections.
There is a video on Cletus McFarland on how his Ripsaw tracked vehicle works, the things wrong with it and how he fixed it. It’s diesel but I think it can it can used on any power train. I think once you see how simple a set up it is you can figure it out. Thanks for sharing. The video is “I bought a Ripsaw tank” or “I bought a tank” it may be the next one on how it works.
Tom Tom, my brother in gift receiving 😮 Great to see the Bombi getting some TLC. I can wait for the rising from the ashes. 😊
Wouldn't it be easier to have the controls in-between your legs instead of to your side? Like maybe weld the controls over or something. Can't wait to see it done! 👍🏻
the most common steering gearbox for most snow cats Comes's out of a Clete track model oc4 planetary box that's why you have to make wider turns I'm restoring a Nodwell Rn 10 its about the same size as bombi i will be watching have fun
It is your Birthday Tom.
Happy birthday Tom! I love watching the stories and this channel! I would like to add that the radiator system in the old version seemed to have a similar issue to which I have battled in my most recent build. The upper heater hose is higher than the radiator cap, preventing a full bleed of the system. I battled overheating every time I drove it. The only way I found to overcome the issue was a different route or an expansion system with the tank higher than the highest point of the system (like a early 2000s ford mustang gt or most VW) good luck with the build and can’t wait to watch what craziness comes next!
I can't wait, neither can Peanut.
Question for Tom, Intec, TRA, NRF, TAN, Central or Argon? I don't see you as a Town Clown.
Happy birthday Tom Tom.
You need the hatch in roof so if you sink into a snow bank and the motor stops you can get out....just thank of a fire starts and you can't get out the door matt....wheres ed guys.
You need a hydraulic drive system!
A v8 in the bombi would scream.
Yay! As a Canadian, it's awesome to see the Bombi getting some love! Thanks for sharing 🇨🇦
Are you considering switching out the clutch and brake system for a hydrostatic drive and steering? It would require a larger hydrolic system and bigger capacity but you could ditch the transmission and gear boxes which would reduce a lot of weight. One crazy idea would be to replace the wheels with UHDPE. THey would shed snow and ice easily and I think be harder to damage than the foam tires currently used? As for the heaters I would suggest a slimline mounted to the roof just behind the front seats and another under the rear bench seat.
Happy birthday Tom!
Not only do I give part numbers out, I’ll give them pictures of what the part numbers are and I still get clothes or a nice jacket. Glad I’m not the only one these comments make me feel better 😂
Stretch the cab outward in the front with your which and bumper. 1'6" gives more leg room for Tom
Sounds like a hydraulic hydrostatic drive would do wonders. Similar to a zero turn lawn mower. If anyone can pull that off you guys can.
I also have a dog named Peanut and she'll do anything to not miss a ride. You don't even need to be near the vehicle, if you leave a door open, she'll be in there ready to go!
It’s yellow!
Cab.  Put more height on the bottom of the cab for more head room on top.
I had a couple of really bad experiences at Dead Lobster many years ago so I stopped going. Maybe I should give them another chance
The bombi definitely needs to be converted to hydraulic drive
Great ending.
Lol at "Ask for P/N, get a tie" 😂 Also, holy cow this Bombi rebuild is LONG overdue, never really added it up until now
Would be cool if you did a hydraulic pump & drive motors and steel roller/ tensiones but that would get expensive real fast
I am wondering if a hydraulic transmission system would be better? something similar to what current model John Deer dozers use!
Why don't you just get tracks for  a Jeep, like Casey?
I drove a snow cat for ~7 years... my sunroof was open, everytime all the time..
Since you got it a school maybe it was built as a project by the students and not from a manufacturer.  That why it has all the different car parts?
Why overhaul it and make it run good?  Some of your best videos are with the Bombi, and the reason they're so good is because of how fraught they are with peril.  Will the Bombi make it?  Will it fall apart?  Who knows?
You guys should try to make an off road rollback tow truck with the new axles the guys bought while you were gone!!
Just jack up the radiator cap and drive a new one under it.
That poor machine. It wasn't designed. It's a mass of crazy bodged ideas. I'm surprised it ever worked. It needs a full on rescue project for itself.
Happy birthday tom
Just put matttracks on the wrecker and you don’t need a snow machine
If basically nothing is left why not put an old school cabover on it and do a crew cab? Make it look cool and unique?
That old blue truck is the next video!
What the French toast sticks
Probably easier to just buy an M113 APC, then make your changes. Very reliable, non proprietary design, cheaper parts.  Brakes on those are amazing.
Finally the Bombi is getting some love!!
Amazing video guys.....good to see some off season work getting done right !!
Just so you know. Lizzy, Cabelas makes a pair of insulated coveralls that are good down to 65 below (with the wind chill) with nothing but a pair of gym shorts and a t-shirt on underneath.
Question. Are you going to try a carter diesel fuel pump that uses a rubber impeller to pump coolant into the cooling system if it overheats. Instead of trying to pour it into a erupting volcano.
We love the bombi! We’re only gonna upgrade this and this and this as tom and Matt point to the whole bombie besides the front seats
A Name option would be the yellow jacket... It's a killer b. The YJ for short.
So it’s overheating but you don’t have no heat 😂
The International TD14 and TD15 Dozers had track brakes, the Cat Dozers (D6,7, 8....) have track clutches.  The Internationals could side hill much better than a Cat because there is always power going to both tracks you were only braking a track to steer, where the track clutch on the Cat Dozers releases power to one track to steer.  Make it hydraulic drive, one drive motor for each track.  Call it the BeMorr or the MorrBe
BTW happy birthday Tom =)
Maybe the skylight is for if you get stuck in an avalanche & need to dig your way up!
Hey matt, suggestion for your cargo bin....  make it from aluminum to save weight =)
You should give the Bomby hydraulic drive/steering. Then you could run one track forward and the other backward at the same time.
With the Bombi stripped down like it is... it somewhat resembles the car used in the tv show "The Banana Splits".....
Just wondering, if you tried a full synthetic high viscosity index oil in your brakes if you would see some improvement...
Hey Matt // Lizzy //  TomTom  & rest of the Crew !!!  Better get going on the rebuild as Summertime ain't gona last long !!!  Lots of parts in Vegas !!  Look at Google for Bombi  parts !!!  Have ""FUN "" with the build as NOT too sure about that back seat without extending the frame ???  🤔🙄👀👀👀👍👍👍👍👍
I don't know if the major stuff is all planned out or not, but if you're getting rid of the engine, and if it would fit, I always thought a chevy inline 5 or inline 6 would be super cool for this thing.  And maybe look in to a real skid steer drivetrain so it can be driven properly. No clue what a system like that consists of or if its possible to install one but it would be cool if you could.
Happy Birthday Mate.
This was "next" and a critical...2 years ago!
Happy birthday TomTom, you bloody legend!!!!!
"Thay kids- wudn't happen to have a cup'a wahm wata wudya?"
The ending was perfect 🙂👍
That ending … 😂
Hi everyone, are there any racing, rock climbing or demolition derby events coming in the near future? I would love to come from Los Angeles to see. Thank you, Greg
That is going to be one awesome machine by the time you're finished with it. Can't wait to see it in it's first recovery after it's done. Give her lots of love Matt and she'll give you lots of good times on recoveries.
Can’t wait to see this build. Much needed.
Happy birthday Tom! Can’t wait to see this Bombi upgraded and back out there.  I might be one of the few but I love winter!
Happy birthday Tom enjoy your day
PLEEEAASSEE,  ya gotta put a 6V71 TT Detroit in that thing !!!!
I would put a new engine in it and dump the transmission, put a big hydraulic pump on it and go full hydro-static with wheel motors instead of that old axle system... Tons of torque and plenty of speed, and easy to build a system like that as well as easy to maintain it.
If you fall through a river like my neighbor did without that escape hatch you will die like he did
Ooooh put one of the corvair vans on top of those treads!
I always wanted to fly one of those.❤❤❤
Can’t wait to get watch the build!
Happy birthday Sir Tom !
Happy Birthday Tom!!!
Found a 1961 corvair wagon for sale in Phoenix for $2500.
I think that since the Bombi can go where the others can’t (and vice versa), it should have its own testing grounds for track vehicles…but I’d love to see it succeed at the testing grounds either way :)
I sub'd for the bombi content.
Thankyou
ell Matt dont need a fuel gauge lol
Doesn’t 15 “upgrades” equal 1 “buy a new vehicle?”
Great video!!! I can't wait to see what all the new and improved changes you make to the Bombi!! I also really liked the story time with you and LIzzy!! Great stuff!!
i dont care what you hate about the bomby i hate tom why dont you kill him
Have you given any thought to hydraulic drive, like a skid steer or a zero turn lawn mower?
is gonna be epic, now that you finally decided to tear into it, may be a good time to give it hydrostatic drive, so you can turn like a tank, heck, even electric drive for the tracks
👍
Glad to see this project come to fruition! Tom....as shop manager....maybe surprise Matt with some heated seats. Any seats other than the seats installed currently ( are those out of the same 90s Astrovan the engine is from ?? )
Happy birthday Tom
This is going to be an awesome build, can't wait to see the Killer B in action! The evolution of your channel has been methodical and everything you are doing is entertaining and interesting there is a perfect mix of recoveries, builds, and comradery, sharing with your entire team, and different vehicles. Love this channel, looking forward to the next one.
Great video!  I think I’m speaking for Spud (can we call the spud truck Spud?) when I say we can’t wait to see the finished product!  If it’s engineered like the other MORR fleet, it will be incredibly capable!
lol the spud truck at the end. you guys should put a diesel in the bombi. that basket on the back seems useful maybe just a smaller one. or just make the whole thing a wagon. with a full size access hatch in the floor to reach the engine.
Happy birthday Tom.
Rename the boomis  Mattbees1&2
Happy Birthday Tom
I feel the same way about birthdays and gifts in general, I feel you Tom 😆
Ok Matt the entertainment value was key on that one
Happy Birthday Tom
Happy Birthday Senor Tomas.
This one should be interesting to watch get built up. Totally different from all of the traditional vehicle type builds.
Would it be better to change the driver's  seat to the center position for better control to operate the vehicle..sitting to the side looks it would be harder to drive
You know ur a long time fan when you know the mechanic who installed that pump.  some "K.C." lights would look good on those 😏
This will be a epic build, looking forward to it and all the fun.
Short attention span theatre, what happened to the spud truck 😂
Happy birthday Tom.. keep up the great work y'all
MAYBE BUILD ONE FROM SCRATCH  HOW ABOUT TRACKS ON THE WORLDS BIGEST WRECKER  😮🤔🤔😊
That ending was so funny!!!!!  Thanks!!
HappyBirthday Tom! .... it ain't every day a guy turns 27, right?
Spud Bombi!!!!
Thanks for the good times watching you guys, I do not watch TV or any program anymore, but your content is pretty good, keep it up Matt and crew
Happy Birthday Tom!
Wrangler 13MWZ
Can’t wait awesome project 👍Aloha from Hawaii 🤙🏽😎🌴
I just want you to know I don't enjoy seeing you stop for Lunch as someone is waiting to get out of a jam. It's unbecoming of a gentlemen. Please improve this! And maybe start putting the time the call comes in and accepted and the time you complete the job. Not only for insurance purposes but also your audience. Sometimes doing the right thing is beneficial. You stopping for lunch didn't occur in this video upload but their are several in the history. One of em the customer managed to get themselves out of the mud because of you taking a random lunch.
Love it... Glad to see the bombee getting some love
Happy Birthday Tom! 🙂 That years 4.3L "octopus" fuel injectors are notorious  for losing a cylinder , even just working on something in the engine compartment not related to fuel you might have a dead cylinder afterwards caused by them .. the upgraded  set has individual injectors at each cylinder and not the poppet nozzle setup it came with , it's a good motor after that 🙂
When the upgrades are done, you need to name it Platinum Bombi 😛
The last part where the blue truck backs up behind the fence was creepy 😂😂😂 will it seek revenge 🤔🤔🤔
The Killer "Bomb-Bee".  Engine, a Ford 300 inline-6, bloody indestructible, more torque than a 4.3.   Radiator a 4-inch desert type.  Fuel tank & Batteries relocated with to the engine deck. safer and far more accessible.
I didn't think you'd work on the Bombi until winter.
How do you determine the drivers side if the controls are in the middle? Any thoughts on moving the radiator to the front for better cooling?
🤘🤘🇺🇸
ill be shocked if it ends up looking like a pistenbully 100
Did hillbilly teach you that smoke is steam  ?
8:45 wow its almost as yellow as the paint lol it looks like mustard😂
Would it help in deep snow like the time u pulled grey Tacoma out of u put a removable plow and Front of nimbi?
woo! cat content!
"you give 'em part numbers, you open the box and it's a tie..."  OMFG so relatable!!! 🤣😂
Omg my snow trax would definitely make the world of difference for you guys.  I got a amazing deal for you. Next time I'm stuck you tow me out and I'd like a shirt 3xl you can have a trax,
To quote the Buick Motor company's mantra of the 1930's... "When better cars are built, Buick will build them". Forward to 2023..."When better Bombies are built, MORR will build them!" And... Happy Birthday Tom-Tom.🎉
7:10 i just love Jamies personality, she just comes in and says watcha doing lol and just smiles away lol i bet she is such a great mom.....
Wow just imagine you are way up in a trail cold weather 37 inches of snow all around and you hv battery problems 😂😂
“Can we please have a seat in here?”  Matt,”No.”  Lmao
i seem to remember that Lizzy did an oil change at some point or other before a job up in the mountains in the winter.  think it was around the same time as when the fuel line came apart.
I'm excited to see the rebirth of this cool little snow machine. I also relate with Tom, I had a pretty terrible 16th birthday and ever since then, it's just been another day in the books.
chevy 350 with header wraped😆. another YTber did it.
Man watching this makes me realize how long I've actually watch this channel how far it has come I remember before you got the bomby before the marvair when you only had the Jeep and Rudy Jeep
Happy birthday Tom. We share the same reason for hating birthdays! 😂
It would be interesting if you did make the bombi capable to climb the waterfalls.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM TOM YOU ARE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE CREW!!!!! Im gonna guess Tom Tom is ummmm 42 lol anyone else wanna guess?
Happy birthday Tom!
OMG! HAHAHAHA! THE ENDING!!!!  "All by myself" The project 6x6 rolling away. That gave me a good laugh.
Happy birthday Tom  🎂 🥳 🎉
Should steer like a sand rail with front end floating.  Or a tractor with broken steering.
Happy birthday Tom 🎈
I'll give you 5 bucks for that rabbit hutch
Have you thought about converting the driveline over to a skid steer set up vs the mechanical brakes?  Find a donor skid steer and possibly retrofit?
love the bombij🐝,mKE IT A BOMBI KILLER🐝🐝🐝,more BOMBI videos ,please!
Maybe a modern day skid steer hydraul8c system🤔
Great music selection (John T. Graham) by someone for that battery swap.
I love the ending. Hilarious 😂😂
4.3l upgrades(also works with vortec 350s):  de-baffle the throttlebody(improves throttle response), marine intake swap(eliminates spider injector and gives you off the shelf bosch injectors).   4l80e would allow you to share parts with the morrvair in an emergency.    Transcoolers for the brake system?  It doesn't look like you have too many good locations where the radiator or aux coolers won't get packed with snow.
Best wishes to Tom-Tom, what a great addition this hugely-knowledgeable, and perpetually cheerful man is to the MORR team!!!
Matt I have a snow cat it's a 2017 the trax are mint the drive train it like new but I did crash it now you might be able to rebuild it I myself won't and I've been paid out for it already  I'd love to see y'all do something with it
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM TOOOOM!!
Check out the lil bombi that BSF worked with! Was like a lil towtruck...CALL ERIC
I no what's wrong with the motor
The Bombi is legend. But I have a dumb question. Why not get a set of tracks for the Banana like Casey LaDelle has on his Jeep? It seems to do quite well in the deep snow for him.
Fake
Just buy a new one....
Oh snap I almost forgot Rudy!
🎉HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM 🎉
Happy Birthday Tom!
that passive aggressive bullshit is disgusting.. love in, hate out.
convert a bobcat to Quad tracks and custom build a rig
Okay, hear me out. Get an old Volkswagen bus and shorten it to fit on top and use that as the body for more room for more room for everybody.   MORR BOMBI BUS = MORBIUS
Ur doggie peanut is licking antifreeze off ur radiator hose,
I don't understand why Brakes are used for steering.  Doesn't that wear them out too fast?!
Happy Birthday, Tom!  You and Matt are rapidly becoming, if not already there, a classic partnership of opposites with shared passions and matching laid-back personalities making it work. A win all around.
You have to call it the Bomblebee!!
Happy Birthday Tom! Yeah guys, you need to upgrade the Bombi in so many ways. Great project that will pay off. Great work guys.
I think it needs a newer ford 1.0 turbo 3 cylinder 😁
The radiator hose on the Bombi looks like a generic one fits all that may be collapsing under pressure if it isn't spring reinforced. Check with Robbie and Hillbilly on collapsed hoses and overheating.
You need a yellow PistenBully
Happy Birthday Tom 🎉
You should consider a hydrostatic drive.  Zero Turn Radius mowers all the way up to the largest modern bulldozers use this method of propulsion and steering.
i love your vids!
The last 10 seconds 🤣🤣🤣
Tom's smile at the lunch looks just like a kidnap victims smile....
Happy Birthday, Tom!
Don't quit your day job Matt, you will never make the charts with that voice.  Just sayin & just kidding.
So, as time and parts deliveries allow you mean?
The ratchet shifter sounds pretty "ratchet." Happy Birthday Tom!
Happy Birthday Tom!  I'm sure you folks know, but for those who don't, the metal that makes up the sides of that cage thing on the back of the Bombi is what's called "Expanded Metal" and it's made from steel. There's 2 versions that I know of: Raised, and flattened. The expanded metal on the cage is raised, which typically provides more traction / grip, but does have a lot of sharp edges to it. (And it's not meant to be used for the sides of a cage. It's usually used on things you walk on that get wet, like trailers, outdoor stairs, etc.) And with it being steel, it's for sure heavy. Flattened metal, is just raised metal that's been fed through rollers that flatten it, which removes a majority of the sharp edges, makes the thickness more uniform and easier to work with, etc, while retaining the strength of the raised.  Making the floor out of aluminum like Matt says he wants to do makes sense to me. Aluminum is lighter and typically just as strong as steel at the cost of being more expensive. If you're trying to stay on top of something that can give way (like snow, sand, mud crust, etc) then making your vehicle as light as possible will certainly help.  I can't wait to see how this build goes. The Bombi has certainly earned an upgrade and some TLC. :)
Hydrostatic drive would be good for that machine more room with no gearbox.
Omg the end Matt😂👌😂👏👏
A aluminum 5.3 would be perfect for this
Killah beez...wu tang 4 eva.
Matt's drinking a V8? what, did Paul come by and steal all the mountain dew?
i When you discussed the oil change i thought you licked the dipstick for taste Eeeyew.
Is that machine built from a 1999 to 02 blazer?
🤣🤣👌👌
Been sawing it for years - work on winter equipment during the summer pls
A snow cat with out a blade is like a dog with out a bone.  Having the ability to grade the road as you drive, fill in holes, dig stuff out is is invaluable!    Up and down and wind row is all you would really need.
don't sing, no no don't sing..hehe
Hey Happy Birthday Tom!
23.07 the car on background is that a 4 dore  Eleanor?!
did you weigh it for a before and after ?
Happy birthday Tom 🎉
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎉TOM
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 I was soo waiting for this video hahhaha
happy birthday Tom Tom
I think Matt needs help beyond what Tom can provide. Happy Birthday Tom. The poor spud truck was crying.
Nice singing, Matt.  🙂
Thank God the Bomby is getting some love
I needed some humor and the two of you provided in in the first 4:42 minutes.  Thank you and God bless youi all.
👍
Yes, that poor thing need that upgrade!
Red lobster hahaha im having haddock shipped in
Super charged 400 small block through turbo 400 trans. Hydraulic brakes. A larger radiator. Longer tracks maybe like the ones on a mini excavator or large track loader or something. Steel wheels instead of rubber. Heck a Sherman tank tracks system so brake not needed. Well that is if the credit card had unlimited balance 😂 I remember seeing a guy built a tank type vehicle a while back that ran like a scalded dog. Ok just kidding on all of that but it would be the coolest snow recovery vehicle  out there.   Maybe I sparked Matt's imagination a litte.🤣
Put a V6 pontiac engine in the bombi
The skylight is an escape hatch.
Epic outro.  🤣🤣   Poor spud truck, sitting on standby.
Tom, BTW, my daughter and son-in-law both work for INL. Glad you broke loose!
Tom Tom is a great addition to the team!!........Not just mechanical, fabrication and welding wise but he compliments Matt's comments well!........Lizzie needs to talk more so she can also be someone that Matt can play off of (like Tom Tom does)!!........Both are very articulate!!......And  Lizzie is nice to look at so she is in a lot of scenes!....LOL......Short and sweet is all it takes..........Also Tom Tom needs to teach Lizzie more on how to weld aluminum......She has earned it!!
I picture the seating as 3-wide, driver in the center. Two rows of seating and a small tailgate area in the back over the engine for Peanut and recovery gear. Am I right Matt?
Matt, I noticed you drinking a V8! Good on ya my man! ditch the hyper sugar, hyper caffeine Mt Dew! Your body will thank you!
Loved the ending
Happy Birthday, Tom!! I'm excited to see what you can do for the Bombi to make it into the...Killer 'B'!
Fit and function I think what Cascade Rescue has done with the tracks has been really successful! Maybe that's a more practical price to fit your business.  Love what you all do keep it up.
They make tracks you can order the put on your wheeled vehicles
Well it don't matter if Tom Tom don't fit in the back because he never let's anyone ride in the front so he's always in the front 😂 just sayin
i think matt’s bombi and robby’s bombi needs to do a tug o war !!
Matt, now that almost everything is taken off the tub, what’s left looks pretty rinky-dink(or sketchy as you say out there in Utah). I vote for a total ground up custom fabrication. I’m sure TomTom has a buddy somewhere who could just happen to drop by with some surplus M1A1 Abrams tank parts or something!🤣
Happy Belated Birthday Tom!  And congratulations on having over twice as many subs as Joe Biden. Lol
Well if off-road recovery doesn't work out Matt can always resort to singing sad songs 😂👍👍
I have been around a lot of snowcats FYI the hatch in the roof is to escape if  you fall through the ice and you cant open the doors.
Happy Birthday Tom!
You should really look in to getting a Hägglunds BV206, that should be awesome for you guys!
Happy Birthday Tom.
LS……It needs an LS……isn’t that hatch in the roof an escape hatch? It looks as though your cooling fan is set up to BLOW OUT through the radiator….if you set it up in the normal pull in through route as in normal it will cool better. As your vehicle pushes through the air the body creates a low pressure area and if you are trying to blow out into that low pressure area it won’t cool. If you set it up in normal the air will flow in from the low pressure area. Don’t believe me….drive a vw bus with the rear hatch open and tell me which way your hair blows ——- forward or backwards.
How bout calling it the Zombie Bombie,since it virtually died and is coming back. Happy Birthday Tom Tom
118
Excellent work, but I can't help but think you'd have been better with a Hagglunds...
They sounded kinda drunk after red lobster i mean sounded happy
Oh man what fun to re-build, make the rear seat area lifted up so the roofline has a step up(Landrover Discovery style) which means you can set the seat back more & have leg room & a tool box/storage underneath or battery box & fuel tank...soooo many ideas.
Your could un screw the radiator cap and drive a "new snow machine " under it then you will be done.
🤣🤣🤣
Happy bday Tom!   Maybe the Bombi needs a hydrostatic drive?  A drive motor and sprocket on each side.  Would have killer steering and it would counter rotate 👍🏻
I recognize those brake handles my grandparents have tree clippers and those are the adjustable handles that came with it
Combine the spud truck, with the bombi!
The skylight would make sense as a safety hatch if it didn't have that bar in the center.
Awesome
And show it much love
Stretch it about 4' make room for passengers in the back and deal with your break issue and get rid of the skylight. You don't need it but most of all put a diesel in it commons therefore diesel there you go
more Rip Saw less Bombi
Great singing  🎶   MATT!  Don’t quit your day job though 🤷🏼‍♂️
That looks like a Quick Silver B&M , it's a ratcheting auto or manual  shifter . Leave it auto or ratchet it down 3 or 4 times depending on the trans. then just slap it forward when you want it to shift , it won't over shift unless you slap it forward twice . I've run those in a few of my hot rods even trucks . Good shifters !
👍
What about just doing tracks on a jeep or other capable rig? It would be way more comfortable, reliable. @CaseyLaDelle 🤣🤣
Give the bombi some much deserved love
“We upped our battery capacity, up yours!”
I think I would consider going the wrecker route and build one from scratch.  How can you improve on perfection?
Matt and Tom, why don't you put a 1949 pickup cab over the top of the chassis, that will give you more room to sit more comfort and it would look so cool!! Snowcats don't need to look boxy. Geoff young, sturgeon Mo.
I’m excited for this series 🎉
What! Matta got a V8 in his hand not a mountain Dew? Dose this mean the bombi is getting a V8!? 😧
What is wrong with Matt, he's working on a snow vehicle in June!  How did he become so responsible?!
Great to see the Bombi getting a proper overhaul! It’s been struggling for so long. Can’t wait to see it at its best. One request, pleeeease don’t put those awful seats back in 😂
You might as well just buy a new one with all this upgrading.
Make the cab wider, longer and relocate the 2 steering levers centered on the drivers seat!
Happy birthday tom
Skylight..more like a saefty hatch incase you get buried in snow.
Matts offroad and recovery Rocket!  Come'on Tom, put your education to work,. Make the Rocket! Just matt it!  Rocket! rocket! rocket! guys i am not trying to be funny, i think it would be a great projet for them, pick a spot on one of the trails, need parts asap and in comes the part on the rocket,  it gets to its gps cords and blows a chute. and matts your uncle. there ys go, mats off road recovery rockets, tom could design this in his sleep, come guys vote this up! if musk can go to mars, tom and matt can rocket up the trail!
Switch to twin hydrostatic drives?
Happy Birthday TomTom, it's my oldest son's Birthday as well!
This comedy duo just keeps getting funnier. Tom, your sense of humour is priceless.
Happy birthday tom tom
Why wouldn't this be called the Morrbee? The ending of this vid... hahahahahahahaha!!!
One of your best videos. Thank you.
I’m so glad to see you devote some time to this thing. It’s been a struggle for the last couple of years! Can’t wait to see it finished!
Happy birthday Tom!!!! 🎉
Loved the song at end and poor blue truck going away sad ;)
God I hate these temu commericals
Happy birthday Tom
Happy Birthday 🎉
The blue potato hauling truck at the end had me rolling 😂 In all fairness,  the Bombi is a much higher priority.
Tucker is made in my hometown....pretty sweet looking, but the local ski area uses Bombardier because  they handle slopes better.
that thing is a really bad set up we see nothing good about any of it that thing is total junk
1:39 "we'll probably fix that" lol XD
Put a turbo on the new 4.0 engine!
The Ending SOOOO funny
Love to see you guys working so well together.  Happy birthday tomorrow
You gotta Cummins swap it
Closing scene was hilarious
Put a Cummins 4bt you’ll never have to fix it again
Happy Birthday Tom!!
1:39  And by 'fix that' Tom means make it non-functional to match the rest of the fleet.
The ending of this video made me laugh literally out loud, thanks for sharing and stay safe 👍
HAPPY BIRTHDAYS!!
The Bombi at work recap was really cool. Well done
Happy birthday tom tom.    And matt. Its about time .....
Incorporate the c-60 to be the killer B suport vehicle.  It could haul it there.   Tilt bed, multi winch toting 6X6
I don’t have a time for you, but happy birthday
Please tell Tom to quit yelling every time he talks
Tom, I don’t have a Thai for you, but happy birthday
Could you swap it over to a hydrostatic system like a skid steer?
Happy birthday Tom Tom!  🎉🎉
Now I have to question Tom's culinary aptitude! Really Tom, Red lobster?
Put 4 sparco seats in it, save alot of weight & make alot of room..
I think you should find another rear engine corvair body and put it on the snow bombie.
Love this! Can’t wait to see where you take it!! I’m guessing 5.3 out of the morrvair in it and 6.0 into the morrvair. Gonna be awesome!
Well you didn't hate the heater boxes the motor the tranny the seeds
the amount your upgrading its like your building a hole new bombi
Where is the beautiful lizzy! I have a huge crush on her!
Turn that basket off the Bombi into a fire pit
Finally a video worth watching
Matt’s vocal was hilarious at the end there.. 😂
Happy Birthday Tom!
The series I’ve been waiting for, Robbie should do the same at the same time for next winter
RE: the fuel gauge... nah.. you'll probably mange to somehow BREAK that in this renovation. We will wait, watch, like and subscribe.
I think a redesign for an exterior fuel tank, battery box would bea good thing.
That's great you've got a disc brake right in the cab basically letting you breathe good old asbestos dust every time it gets used
Bombi will thank you for all the love you are fixing to show it .
Matt you should  just take that body off and put a Cherokee body on it.
Matt needs a tshirt that says “I don’t know if this is going to work or not…… but.”
if only this much time and attention went into videoing the off road wrecker trip last video... most of which was focused on fixing a flat tyre. This is meant to be a channel about Off Road recoveries but more and more it is becoming an engineering and fabrication channel and rescues are being treated like an annoying interruption. Matt goes into great detail of every little screw when he takes something apart yet on the last off road recovery over a supposed giant waterfall he just goes "oh yea there's a big waterfall just below us, this is real dodgy" yet five cameras in action they can't be bothered showing it as just one example.
Its not a sky light.. Its a vent for when its humid from all the snow and sweaty people in it...
The ending is so great lol 😂 😂
I’d like to see a 4bta Cummins a hydrostatic drive with hydraulic winch. Put heater on the roof or engine radiator on roof. The brakes could be done away with with hydrostatic drive. Only need to work out a parking brake. Trans not needed, diff not needed, tracks buy heavy conveyer belt the wheels I don’t have any ideas at the moment. If you could find a used Track Jarraff at auction you would have most of the parts you need.
Happy birthday tom and have fun with bomby bee those are a hoot to work on
Spud truck bros, our time will come.
Chinese parking diesel heater hand down.
Why not change out the entire drive system with a drive and motor from a skid steer loader. Those are super reliable
...jus wondering if Tom Tom is Canadian...he sure looks like my former boss who is Canadian...😊
Instead of "killer bee" you should call it "killer bombi" !!! Look forward to seeing the build.
What day is Toms birthday?
Happy birthday Tom!
I to love red Lobster in St George
I have soooo been waiting for this.
Hey Matt, don't quit your day job to become a singer. 😁😁
4.3l have head gasket and intake gasket problems. With i been overheated a few times already, id replace them. Plus I hope its gets a good once over. The cylinder bank shut down is probably a bad ground on ignition system.
20:25 Rory's work is absolutely legendary. It may not look the prettiest, but man- everything he builds works so well. Even it's out the middle of nowhere using improvised tool sets with snow or rain coming down. Incredible.
Happy Birthday Tom!
pain in the a $$ to find the prices for those batteries why do companies go out of there way to make it difficult to buy their products and Happy Bday Tom
Happy Birthday TOM!!!
Habby birdy tom. How's the lobster. Did they claw right thru yur order😅
Need to do a stock 5.3 LS. Reliable and if the motor ever goes you can get one for $500. Lol
No ads? Demonetized for the happy birthday song I bet
Other option for winter :) Equip the Wrecker with Nokian Hakkapeliitta 44 Size: LT475/70 R17  !
This video doesn’t exist without the phone call re-enactment
who ever built that snow machine has to be the dumbest person on earth!!!
Happy birthday, but can you next time or think about it out of respect don’t wear hats inside buildings
I’m laughing way to hard at this episode!!!!😂🤣    Old blue in the back ground…..😢😢😢
Happiest of Birthdays to you Tom!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!!!! From the hills of Vermont!!!!
Poor poor Spud Truck.😢 One song from Matt and it was GONE!😂
It is an escape hatch not a sky light. In case you get the doors enclosed in snow , either from an avalanche, snow fall from trees or a freak storm that sticks you.
Oh the ending!! LOL!!!
Awesome video, killer B Amazing name
Can't wait to see the process to the "Reborn Bombi!
You need to set it up like a tank steering.  Handel barsteering between  the legs 😊 not positive about steering hydraulic  or break . Hydraulic would be awesome  ! With a v8 pushing it around  !
Hahahah. Love the cheesy monologue. Looking forward to seeing an LS dropped into the Bombie
Happy birthday 🎉 Tom Tom
Possible to relocate those steering bolt cutters to in front of the pilot? Know you're takin out ancient heaters so why not just use heat from engine coolant which adds more engine cooling volume. With cutout for summer but still use the added volume as extra radiator. A big block 4 core radiator wud help a lot. L8r.
The end tho... that killed me AHAHHAHAHAHHA
Matt reminded me of Yukon Cornelius (Island of Misfit Toys) when he licked at the dipstick. Lol! Thanks for that trip back into my childhood best of memories!  : )      Happy Birthday Tom!
Happy birthday Tom
Happy Birthday Tom!
In the spirit of current events, when this project is done it will be the "Atom Bombi".💣
Happy Birthday Tom
Happy Birthday Tom !  Looking forward to the reincarnated Bombi ! Great video.
Happy happy Another day tom tom I ment happy birthday 🎉
Matt, You're no spring chicken, and I have made it into the pan, and 2nd day left overs, till I am now at the dumpling stage. So for me, looking at the brake handles, One handed if they work correctly, wouldn't be an issue, but two hands on both shifters, and pulling(or pushing) would be a back killer for me!. So I was thinking, since y'all do such good fab work, why not get creative with some bends, and relocate the brakes over to in front of the driver? Thus might also give enough room for a middle seat too. Back to the fab and creative nature you have, have you thought about looking at Robby's Snow Cat, and possible extending the seating area more like what his machine is? Also, seems like the double radiator system is workng well for TWLORW, Two decent sized radiators might be able to keep everything cool that needs to stay cool.I'd also think about the heater boxes, not just the heater fans, and locate the heater core(s) in the back and only run some insulated heater tubes to the front and back with seperate controls, so everyone can be comfortable.
Happy Birthday Tom  🎂
I don't know what you have in mind for steering could you put two brake peddles and power disk breaks for steering.
Matt, we REALLY need to talk about fuel range accuracy across your fleet man. I love your stuff and I've been waiting on the bombi build for years and I can't wait to see how it turns out!!!
Happy birthday Tom. Enjoying the video as usual. Trust me I'm not a pervert but this old man just loves lizzy. She's such a sweetheart. Every one of your videos make me smile. But lizzy makes me smile a little wider 😊
I kinda assumed you would retire the Bombi and turn a Corvair Greenbriar into a snow machine.
Matt your new truck rebuilds are OK but they are re-runs🥴 let’s go rad!!!! Get with parks and build a new path 1-2 miles long or do a mercy run? Build a shelter with bathrooms and food with solar air conditioning or winter heat where most danger is. Radio tower CB wi-Fi what ever saves lives. $500,000. Donation charity tax deduction. Put your gangs plaque on the building. Have free water/food and security cameras to keep the druggies out.  Mat you know some places need shelters. Your the man and your team. Perhaps you can go $1.500,000 in three yrs. Charity is great tax savior. Plus save lives happy families just because of the “A” TEAM😊
BOMORRBI
Hey Matt.  Love the show.   Regarding your singing, I have a statement and a question.   Statement is "don't give up the day job".  The question is what did you really do with the money that your Mother gave you for the singing lessons?    Bahahhahahhahahhahaha.   Keep it coming, Team.   Good stuff.     On another note, other than B flat, Happy birthday, Tom.
I noticed that you have your batteries buried somewhere in the vehicles which makes it impossible to disconnect them in an emergency situation . Do yourself a favor and put master disconnect switches on the negative side of the battery/batteries that's easy to access and mount a booster lug in a convenient location for the times you need a boost or boosting something else. The reason I am recommending this is because I had a tractor burn 🔥  to the ground because starter solenoid stuck keep cranking even though the ignition has been turned off  and by the time I got wrenches to get the battery covers off and try and disconnect the batteries it was too late and it's not like the battery compartments were modified it was all factory installed. I got first battery uncovered and disconnected and then it started on fire and I couldn't get to the other battery in time. Everyone kept saying why didn't you just cut the cables well you couldn't get at them because you had to remove battery cover off to get at them and there is a panel over starter to prevent tampering.  Needless to say everything I own now has disconnect switches added bonus is when equipment or vehicles sit for long periods of time keeps the batteries from draining from parasitic draws and also prevents you from burning your shop down because you have electrical issues or something overheating I will never leave a vehicle or piece of equipment in a shop unattended without disconnecting the batteries same goes for cutting and welding prepare to stay in the shop for at least 2 hours after you have finished cutting or welding  nothing worse than losing everything to a couple little details.... By the way happy birthday Tom how old does this make you? as old as dirt or older than dirt 🥳🥳🥳👍👍
Well working on the bombie gives you time to plot and organize the spud truck build get part together etc Bombie will be cool when done looking forward to watching the team build it up
15:09 peanut is actually a cat
So Excited for the Bombi rebuild. Happy Birthday Tom!
I joked with my wife that you all should just throw tracks on the spud truck and call it a day.
happy birthday tom
From a former snow cat mechanic of the rocky mountains, I have seen many modifications to cats over the years but the best thing I could suggest for your application switch to a turbocharged of course  gasoline or diesel, and 3 way spliter box ,bolt on the Transmission pumps with a hydrostatic drive system. The conversion would put the control Box between your legs with a Morris control head and full zero  turning ability regardless The usage you will be putting it in too.  And with the 3rd pump , have you ever heard of a winch cat?.
why don't you make it as long as Robbie's cat snow plow
Happy Birthday old man!! I'm 51yrs old so...don't take that as an insult...lol.
Was nice to meet Tom today.  Wondered if that was him.  Scanned the parking lot until I found Dig Dug.
The steering/brakes seem similar to the dual brakes on John Deere tractors. Also happy birthday Tom
Just take off the tracks and drive the Bombie up the trail on its wheels 😉
Will the "Killer Bee" Get black and yeller stripes on a stinger on the rear?
Matt if you were me, which you are not, but I would put hydrostatic drive, and a tilt cab like a Skid steer.  And like a Skidsteer put a joystick direction controller in it. Heck. Scrap the bombie, and buy a big Skidsteer like the biggest Cat CTL Skidsteer and put some 30 or 36 inch tracks by 6 to 8ft or so on it. Mount a 30,000 lb hydraulic winch on the back and on the front boom.
Happy Birthday Tom
Who channel is it Matt's or the idiots??????????get rid of the idiot knowall
Happy Birthday Tom Tom🎂🍦
Leave it to the know all Tom he knows ,f/witt
Happy Birthday Tom
3 words - Full hydraulic steering
Dang Matt you need to drop an album awesome singing 😂
One suggestion I would give you is before you put the cab back on would be to figure out some was to put an extinction lift of 4" to 6"  to the body to give you more head room. When you were in it showing the things you liked and disliked the clearance for head room looked tight. I think you were already going to address the legroom issue maybe by stretching the cab so a lift at the same time would not be out of the question I don't think. It looked like it might be fairly easy to do by just adding sheet metal to where the mounting points are and fill sheet metal to a skirt around the cab area.
Get a used "snow cat"; that will be the ultimate
Hey Matt, Can you make a Bombie track speed up to turn instead of one slow down??? It's so much better going up hills. Please bring this to Matt's attention. Thanks you guys are amazing!
I see
Tom is definitely Matt's most appreciable tool in the shop. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM.
That's too funny... Lizzy talking about the job & Matt's like,ya,we won't bring that job back up 😂 Can't wait to see the finished project 🤠👍
I love the Red Lobster. Those cheddar bay biscuits are a dream.
Happy Birthday ,Tom . So Wise , Thank You for the trip down memory lane. so Wise to do a Restoration .  Good to see Lizzie , Ed and the rest of the crew
Bombi is getting such love!
I miss the winder hats.
I'll agree on those red handles. I have pruning sheers that work exactly like that. You twist the end of the handle 90° and the handle extends. Twist it back and it locks at the extended length.
Thanks for making. I like the ending.    It is about time for the Bombay
you should use pedals instead of sticks ?
Yeah you guys better get that little snow  cat ready… it will be winter again before you know it….Happy birthday Tom… I hope you had a good one… thanks guys…
Most honest for sale AD ever
Happy Birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁
It sounds like you should get ceramic brakes. I'm thinking you should improve the sunroof - so it's actually useful. I'd get a couple 300W solar panels on the top of this thing as well, with a LifePo4 battery bank for some solid high-amperage electrical supply without having to uprate the electrical system off the engine so much.
Looking forward to this build to see how much it is improved from an engineering standpoint.
Happy Birthday Tom!!!!
Poor Spud lmao
The killer bud already taken by celery’s McFarland, bros
Happy birthday Tom!
Turn the skylight around backwards. Wind won’t pick it up
great episode. loving the direction of the channel. 😁keeps getting better and better. Keep on rocking you guys
Was this video about repairing the bombi or a trip down memory lane
+1 for Matt's Yukon Cornelius moment with the dipstick
Definitely pulling me in 2 directions. I'm really looking forward to the 6x6 build, but the bombi definitely deserves attention. I hope the cab gets extended for more passenger room.
If strength is a factor, I wonder if you could get drift car hydro e-brakes and replace the two steering shears with four handbrake levers…one for each corner of the Bombi. For cooling, ducted radiators + fans are your friend! Maybe another YouTube channel could 3D scan and create a few custom parts for you ;)
Happy birthday Tom
Ever since that wrecker competition . . .
"working fuel gauge?" "We'll probably fix that!" LMAO pleaseeee
Need a Corvair van body for it
Happy Birthday Tom!
I have started giving people sympathy cards for their birthday.... sympathizing with them that they are now a year older.....
A shrimp trio for me Tom. Merry B'day!
That snow machine is an"add -on design". Taking it down and building it up right is the only way. I've been working on that for 49 years and so often I've been told you can't beat factory ; to which i reply" watch me". Love your channel. As a suggestion put in a space for emergency fuel can😅
I know these videos run behind a bit but what about a center control seat in the front with seating either side and the back seat
The end made me LOL.
Happy Birthday, Tom!  🙂
That was a wonderful return to memory lane and synopsis of the Bombie’s conditions. A lot of laughs too especially the very end with the lonely forgotten Potato. 😅
Modification is needed I guess. I can see you are a good neat specialist
Happy Birthday Tom Tom
Since you are going to upgrade almost all of the machine, it might be better to just build another one based on the basic design of this one.🤔
How about replacing the cab with a corvair van body?
This video was great. Review cons and pros of the Bombi, then, in real time, things are singled out for replacement. It's like the rebuild has simmered on a back burner for months in Matt's and TomTom's brains, part numbers pile up, and then it's time to reduce it to the cabin's sheet metal skin and what, the frame, and the rest is just getting it done. Pretty amazing knowledge of what's available 70 years after it was built. The brake-steering sounds like it never could have worked. Keep it up, these rebuild series are terrific. I just found and watched all the follow-on videos to ripping and tearing Ed's smudged nugget from is tomb. On that, is the paint job Robby and team did for Ed's vehicles standard operating procedure, or was that 20x what an average Joe would get? I suspect the former. Ed ranks.
MORR TO 2,000,000
😂 you guys make great videos
We had a Tucker style snowcat that was made by Grumman on the U.S. Coast Guard base at Mouse Island, Newfoundland and I took a ride in it.  It could go almost anywhere.  I believe it could even float on water.  The snowcat was a necessary vehicle since we would get accumulated snowfalls of up to 8 feet.
On that Indianola job I saw something that was way off and extremely different from what I've seen on this channel before and that was Matt was wearing a jacket and Robbie was out there with just his short sleeve work shirt on like Matt usually is and Robbie wears a jacket when there is snow on the ground for the most part
The bombi(?) Looks as well thought out as other things delorean was involved in😂
The Ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus’ Paradox, is a fascinating thought experiment that has intrigued scholars for centuries. It raises thought-provoking questions about the concept of identity over time. Imagine a scenario where each part of a ship is gradually replaced, one at a time. The fundamental inquiry emerges: Is the vessel that remains after all the replacements the same ship as the one that existed before?
I feel Tom, you give them part numbers and they give you a tie..
That Outtro was priceless
Great seeing Ed in the videos when he can make it.  We love you Ed!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom. You and Matt make a great team.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom l hate ties too
Why don’t you put snow tracks on the Banana?????? Then you wouldn’t need the Bombi ?????? Happy Birthday Tom🎉🎂
Happy Birthday Tom. Glad you are here to get Matt to consider better things and ways. Sometimes.
Ed was just there listening to Matt’s old timer stories. 😂
@ 4:39 in the video........  You've most likely already have a 'PLAN, but I was thinking, Could you mount an entire small minivan body (minus the front clip) to the Bombi chassis, in place of the body it has now? I'm thinking of something like one of the original Chrysler Corp minivans from 1985 or so, the SHORT one. That would give you room for 5, plus cargo.
Production value has gone off the charts!  Incredible episode everyone.
Looking forward to it guys!
There is another bombi parked on I6 on the way to Price up on the summit.
Is peanut a pure breed border collie ?
Happy birthday Tom!
Happy birthday tom
Awesome.
Hey, Rudy needs batteries 🤣🤣
Matt don't sign any contracts for your singing skills, until you talk to me fist! All I can say is....WOW, just...uh.....wow!    Lol
I'm with Tom, the struggle is real, but it is nice to have people around that actually notice, I've been through a few years when I didn't have anyone wish me a happy birthday and I thought I'd be happy...nope lol gotta love the people who treat you like family
I’d say that’s one of the strangest videos you’ve put out.  Can’t wait to see what power plant you use.
They ask what you want, you give 'em part numbers and you get a tie. Maybe you should try asking for a tie and see if you get any of the parts on the wish list.
The bombi is gonna be the BOMB! Good small torquey GM motor Ecotec 4 or 6 cylinder they love cold and hot. With decent maintenance. They'll run forevr
Ever consider converting to hydrostatic drives?
The Spud Truck at the end….
Possibly the greatest ending to a video that there has ever been
Happy birthday 🎂 Tom 🎉🎉 keep up the good work
Happy Birthday Tom
It appears that the fan is pulling air into the engine compartment. Try reversing the process and blow the air out of the engine compartment, toward the rear of the vehicle.
It's Sumner why work on the Bombi ?
Hi Matt what if you add excavator foot peddles to the controls so you dont have to use the hand controls and turn sideways to use them on your way to the recoveries. Once you get to the recovery can switch to hand controls.   Also Happy Birthday TomTom 🎉
Aren't the "roof hatches" actually emergency exits when you drive on frozen water.. Like tractors have.. So if you occasionally drive on frozen rivers, lakes and the like.. then you'd probably rather make bigger hatches, but better quality: )
I struggle with birthdays, people ask you what you want, you give them parts numbers, you open the box and its a tie... -TomTom
When the full throttle batteries upset you, switch to XS Power and you'll be much happier.. just sayin
I could have sworn lizzy changed the oil in the past
Looking forward to the Bomb build series. Happy Birthday Tom. One nice accessory for the Bomb... oven box to heat up future 'Victory Pies' mounted on or near the exhaust manifold.  Thanks for sharing.
Good Lord Lizzie is so gorgeous
How about getting a low mileage skid steer and pull out the entire Bombi drive train but keep the tracks.?  With a skid steer hydraulic drive train you would have a much simpler system, a much more robust system and a lot more access to parts.
Happy Birthday Tom. Today is my birthday! Cheers buddy.
Morr please.
Use a corvair van as the body.  More options with seating and supplies.
The bulk of the video was just sitting there telling stories. Where’s the repairs?
Put a corvair body and call it the snowvair or maybe an astro body. Greetings  from  costa rica
It says Bombi in the title.
Well Paul has the cnc plasma cutter. Make centers for the wheels.
lol, we just got tricked into watching a Matt's Offroad Recovery "clip show" episode.
LS like the Morvair and put the gas tank in the basket like you did with the wrecker
For all the pissing and moaning from the staff changes, glad to see people in the comments seem ro be coming to their senses and realizing that Tom's not a bad guy even if they choose to act, surprised about it. Why some people choose to get so involved in other's lives I will never understand and it honestly almost drove me away from the channel for all the drama. I'm here to watch off-road fabrication, testing and recoveries and not to find friends or a new family. Bizarre...
HAPPY BDAY TOM. I ALSO DONT LIKE TO CELEBRATE/MAKE A BIG DEAL ON MY BDAY, AND MY BDAY IS ON DECEMBER 31. YES NEW YEARS EVE.
Older snowcats did not have pivot steering which reverses the direction of one track. I suppose that you could modify it. But that's a lot of stress on your system. Better to upgrade your drive train.
KEK. Poor Baby Blue, Spuds Mattkenzie?, and that song at the end just hit me so hard.
Gas tank right under the seat next to the battery if that catches fire 🔥 be hard to get out in time befor it become a bomb 💣 plus I bet you could smell gas ⛽️
1. Happy Birthday Tom Tom. 2. Relocate the battery for better,safer access.3. Mount the brake cooler in an open air space for better cooling. Just thoughts. God Bless 😊
I would split the two topics off road recovery and working on the vehicles into two channels.
I love Tom. " I completed the training course and I am certified to drive it."
WE are going to stay tuned in to the Bombi episodes 😂
Happy B'Day Tom.
The alarm bells going off inside Tom's head can always use an upgrade, Matt seems to naturally push them way beyond their duty-cycle rating. --- Thanks for the great upload. --
😂😂😂😂 Nice ending, Bombi needs more SEATs.
Tot Tom, you continue to crack me up with your Matt-banter. Keep it up MORR team!😊
Y’all are finally getting to make a ClarkSaurus outta the Bombi ?  Woo and Hoo ! Will it be The BombiRex ? 🤔❤️
Happy Birthday Tom Tom.
Sounds like walk behind mower steering.
This is only a joke but you should fix all of the issues and then break the fuel gauge so you still feel at home when using it.
The absolute best thing about the BOMBI is the name. Can't change that. BOMBI!
Hey Matt long toe watcher of the recovery show I wanted to see if you ever did anything with the Comanche Jeep
i know your business - it is looking good
I love Tom's mind(Happy Birthday!) but it need's Matt's money....lol
Happy Birthday TomTom. Glad you are updating the Snow Cat.
🤣🤣🤣 that last clip was hilarious!!!
This will be cool to watch, then see how it performs doing what bombi's do! Til next time, take care, and we'll see you on the next...
Down memory lane, I'm going with Tom for the win…
Abit more power and a massive cooling system and it will be good
Sounds like you have an injector causing a bank of 3 to go down  A complete new set will fix it right , double check wiring to the injectors because a rubbing wire can cause the same effect.
So in short you are rebuilding whole new Bombi lol
I was hoping for MORRbi
I've had two AGM batteries fail and if you accidentally run it dry they often can't be recharged, they will seem like it but then they will be dead within two days. I had them in my old diesels but they failed so I'm back to the old stuff and no more problems.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!!  TOM WILL HELP MAKE THE BOMBI BETTER THAN EVER!
While you are at it, ditch the breaks and install a full hydraulic drive. If only you had an Engineer available to help?? Wait, isn’t TOM an engineer??
Happy Birthday Tom. What if you guy's use the bombi as a support vehicle to a tucker pickup truck snow cat style with the same set up as the world's largest off road wrecker for the main snow recovery allowing ya'll to have the same difference in ease of recovery as the more vare to the largest wrecker just for snow & that will get Lot's of views for sure, well,, Please have a great rest of your day Matt, Tom, Crew & Everyone else who reads this.     FREESPACE JUNK REMOVAL,,                                                         Brian...
That was good 👍
Happy Birthday TomTom Mine also.
Frist of all Red Lobster sucks.Were I live they all went out of business.Thank God,they really suck. I am a Butt hole. I live less then 40 miles from the Ocean in the Live Free or Die State. Right now a live lobster at a supermarket is around $8 a pound.I said I am a butt hole. Anyways how much is a real New England live and kicking lobster in Utah.If you don't mind.I love your channel.Thank you for the great videos.
looks like you're going to need a bigger shop!
That ending was awesome. Old blue reminded me of the swiffer commercial when the broom peaks out around the corner. "Baby come back I don't want to see you leave"
Great to see you giving the Bombi some love! Can't wait to see the upgrades! 👍
I'm glad to see this upgrade, I've been looking forward to it since you first mentioned it. I look forward to see what yall do to it
Make the cab bigger!!! Seating for SIX!!!
Should put a Corvair van or pickup body on it. "Trackair".
Very nice to see Lizzy back again!
Matt, you all are just a bunch of nutters with wrenches! You are the Bombi! Keep 'em comin'!
It's NOT a skylight, it's a ESCAPE HATCH!!!!!
Didn't know you could sing Matt!
Scrap the bombi, and buy a Hegglunds 206.
Hopefully you get it fixed before winter time gets there. LOL!
While she is apart widen the cab by 12" then lengthen the back another 12" so you can have a nice plush interior, oh yeah even dump an LS or Cummins in the little beast...
❤️👍👍👍👍👍😎
Happy Birthday Tom.
If you keep the brake controls you should turn them into foot pedals
Ahhhhh…. A new 6 month shop project.   It’s such a cute snow rig to be such a used dog.
Happy Birthday Tom!!!🎉🛠🛠🛠
Smashed the like button as the video started! Sorry but I’m a little too excited to see this thing machine finally get some upgrades it desperately needs!!! Now it’s time to watch this thing!
Your garage doors look like big bomby tracks.
Why do the blokes wear baseball caps all the time, even indoors and at the dinner table?
Matt and Tom are becoming a very entertaining duo 😅
Sing it Kenny Jr.   (Rogers)
We can’t wait to see the reincarnation of Bombi!
Tell me how you really feel about the skylight!
Happy belated Birthday Tom! The voice of reason!
How cool would it be to put a chopped bus on the Bombi??
Tom Birthday, "People ask what you want and you give them part number"  lol
happy B-day  TOM...
Somebody already said minivan body. I'm curious how your other Corvair would fit.
What    you    need    is   MATT   TRACKS    then    you   can   put   them   on   any   rig    you   want ,   or    a   newer    TUCKER   all   those    old   BOMBis    suck   and   PISTONBULLYS     thats    why   there  cheap  .
Happy Birthday Tom! Can't wait to see the Killer Bee Bomby!
Happy Birthday Tom-Tom! It looks like you have your work cut out for you for the next three months.  Is there a way to convert to ceramic disc brakes so they will run cooler?
Might this be your first diesel powered vehicle? 😎
Isn't that sky-light an extra escape hatch?  It's pretty small but, it would work in a bad situation if you got wedged-in for some weird reason.  Maybe just turn the flap around so it's not into the wind and put a rubber gasket around it?  IDK...just thinking.  I do see it has a beam going right across it...maybe that ruins the whole idea.  Peanut could fit through to go get help Old Yeller style.
👍👊
Happy birthday to you Tom🎉🥳
To much talking not enough doing.
🎂🎂Happy Birthday Tom
Hey Matt, do me a favor please don’t quit your day job!
Awesome story time thanks
Happy birthday 🎉🎈🥳 tom
Hahahaha that ending was great.
Keep the “sky light”! It’s an important safety feature.   It’s serves as the escape hatch if you break through ice that then keeps the doors from opening.
The closing with the Spud crying was epic.
Happy Birthday TomTom 🎉🎁🎂🎊🎈 Glad the Bombi is finally getting the attention it needs.
So glade to see you start on the bombi
That's a long way for the coolant to get to the breaks, no wonder they get hot.
Leave the Winder sticker though. I'm sentimental.
Happy birthday Tom.
What I love about bombies.. They are bombies. What I hate... Well, they are bombies 😂
Since you have time and are kinda free to redesign it as you see fit, you could potentially make it a 6 seater with some access panels for stuff you need to carry and your crew has places to sit when you have the customer with you.
with how frequently Matt and crew preform maintenance on their rigs, for the love of god put a Kubota engine in the Bee.
I would love to see you get a donor Isuzu Trooper ? with a 4cyl Turbo Diesel, trans, for driveline, and just replace the whole body with something 'morr' in line with what you guys need it for. Ultimately it should have a Corvair trunk style hatch/pickup bed, so that you can call it the "Snowvair" ;-)
😂😂frozen hands to the track like a frozen tongue to a pole in wisconsin😅😅 beeing from wisconsin and knowing the feeling great refrence matt
I’m looking forward to seeing Bombie build
BOORING
We have seen it -29 in indianola in the winter of 2003.
“This engine doesn’t run real good and I don’t know why”  2min later  “I have never changed the oil in this engine” 😂
Lol with this weather it might be September or August!!
Are you sure you might want to make it longer inside  and  longer tracks ?
You guys going to try and change / improve the steering of the Bombi to something more like a skid steer?
So how many years has that beautiful woman been around you
Could the bombi run on a center track like a snowmobile or would you be able to turn like you can with 2 tracks ?
It's been really worth a little time and effort to research 'why' switching over to an AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) battery like the FULL THROTTLE is worth the extra money to do so - especially for those of you who do a lot of overlanding / off-roading and are operating things like lots of lights, winches and electronics. - - The intense heat out here in Southern Utah during the summer months can 'cook' ordinary lead/acid design batteries in as little as 2 years.   Thanks for sharing this content - It reminded me to change out our SUV's 5-6 year-old?? battery , which has been working just fine up till now - but will be discarded very soon, as a 'preventative-maintenance' task.   And just for a little useless trivia; 4:43 - The metal rack that was removed off the back of the Bombi? - It weighed just under 200 lbs.
Happy belated birthday Tom Tom!
Happy to see you working on the Bombi before winter, this is going to be good!
Please have mercy and no more singing. And I thought I sounded like a hound dog with his foot snagged.
Glad to see the Bombee is getting the love it deserves.
Happy birthday Tom! This being the same concept as a snow cat, was that maybe an escape hatch? They’re required on snow cats in case it would help in the event of an avalanche, but this isn’t a commercial vehicle I don’t think so idk
Happy Birthday Tom 🎉
It needs a proper radiator and fan set up. Look how large they are on a skid steer. This needs way more radiator
in hindsight, the skylight is probably an escape hatch if you end up buried in snow
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Too bad you couldn't make it hydrostatic like a tractor or straight hydraulic drive so the motor only drives a pump. You've likely thought of all that and more I'm sure.
A Better Bombi it shall Be! Maybe a Morebee than Bombi.
Happy birthday tom tom!🎉
🥳 Ya’ll are so fun to watch! Thank you! Happy birthday Tom! You deserve a STRAWBERRY milkshake from SALLY!! 🥤🥤 I will continue to watch EVERY EPISODE until I reach SUPER FANDOM! 😂
Happy birthday Tom,  this should be an interesting build
I have Sue been looking forward to these episodes coming up working on this thing is going to be so cool to watch the transformation!!
This vid ended too soon...i hope the updates come quickly
There's a simple fix to your problem.  World's largest off road wrecker on TRACKS !
Who’s the blonde cutie he’s with? She’s super cute
It’s not a skylight it’s an escape hatch. Tracked vehicles are often used for snowmobile trail grooming or other uses where they cross frozen lakes, rivers, and swamps. Although I will say it was a pretty small escape hatch so not very useful for some folks.
The scene in A Christmas Story, where he get's his tongue stuck on the flagpole was in Cleveland.
This could do good with a little 4 banger diesel just naturally aspirated. Or would that be too heavy.
the BOMB-bde
Sorry SPUD MORR the Bomby was there longer. Bide your time it will happen.
I'm very interested to see what you do to the Bombi.  Replace those friction band steering brakes with disks and calipers will be a good start.  Take a look at some of the newer Snow Cats to see what they are doing.
Ok, I HAD TO give this a thumbs up 👍🏼👍🏼😮.. way to funny 🤣. Love the ending also 😂😅🎉 !!!
If you have ever driven an old dozer you would find that the hands operate clutches to steer gradually and the feet operate brakes to steer sharply.  That way you are simply disengaging the drive to steer gradually creating no extra heat.  When braking you already have the clutch pulled before you brake so again no big friction.  You likely can't throw the whole guts away to copy a dozer though.
OK, Matt, don't quit your day job, as your singing voice sucks. My dog sings better than that. lol  To a better Bombi!
IVE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS!!
happy birthday brother
Happy Birthday Tom
Move the engine further back. Use a minivan body or extend the cab you have to fit more crew. Add a tool/rope box on top of the cab or to the sides of the engine. Heater ducting can go on top of the cab.
poor o blue chevy, mortater just does realize all the love he gonna get after the bombanana(jeep body).....🫠
Dump it and buy a new modern snow-cat.    Just kidding….
I believe Matt is a huge fan of foreshadowing 😅😅
I freaking love Peanut! lol
saw the video title and assumed you were FINALLY going to upgrade the cooling capacity for the Bombi. Well, I wasn't wrong XD
16:20 don't old Sherman tanks work like that?
A lot of work ahead for you... I think it will be worth it..
Happy belated birthday, Tom!
the sky lite is an escape hatch if your traversing ice and go down
Can you move the brake handles so they are in front of you and not the side
Ya might as well build a larger cab body.. raise it 12 inches at least at the rear and you have more comfortable seating.
A corvair van body is what the Bombi needs.
happy birthday tom. ill take the ties.
Great information on the boombee. I can't wait to see all the improvements you are going to make. God bless you all.
How Hard would it be to just Body Swap a Wagon body on the Bombi?  Maybe a 4 Door Scout truck body?  Drill a couple of holes for the levers.  Make a Z bend attachment to relocate the levers center of the driver seat.
Lmfao when you said nope to the seat in the back , good times y’all
I sometimes wonder if Matt and the crew look forward to the day when the channel eventually runs its course. They were so lucky to have the channel and merch subsidize their fleet upgrades, and at some point they'll go back to being able to just go about their day.
Blue Chevy just fell off the list
Y’all need to invest In some Milwaukee packout Products
Maybe you should add an inverter to power some tools, or a coffee maker.
Super happy to see work finally being done on the Bombi!
Happy Birthday Tom!
Tom is awesome.  Happy birthday, dude!
Happy Birthday,  Tom Tom!! Yay Bombie (sp?) love! The bit at the end with the spud truck had me dieing laughing.
You have more money than god just buy a new one idiot
Happy Birthday, Tom!
Idea:  Gas-Electric Bombi.   Keep the engine, add some motors from an EV, add a generator, and some electronics to run the motors.  Then you can ditch the transmission, driveshaft, and mechanical braking system to save weight, and you'll have a zero turning radius!
🎉🎉🎉 happy late birthday Tom Tom 🎉🎉🎉 🥳🎊 🎊🥳🥳🥳
How hard would it be to switch to a separate hydrostatic drive on each side?
I like the ending      all by myself
Matt singing was amazing! Can’t wait to watch this build. It needs it! Great video guys
Tom Tom, Happy Birthday, mate 🎉
Letssss gooo. Finally the love it deserves....happy birthday Tom
I retired June 8 of this year, you're my favorite  off road channel, I thought you were going to really tear into this one, but Who am I kidding, it's summer . I'm sorry it's my problem I can't make it any one elses.
Happy Birthday homie!!!
I forgot that Matt enjoys drinking V8
Since the Wrecker and the Morrvair have LS V8s, shouldn’t the Bombi get one too?
I think you guys should put together a Bombi Games for this winter.
You know, I bet a locomotive-style gas-electric drive would allow you to fully reverse one side and pivot in-place. You'd put a generator on the motor instead of the transmission and electric drive motors on the axles. It'd be heavy and expensive, but it'd allow you to improve the mobility a lot!
Matt needs to make fuel gauge stickers for your dash that go *over* the fuel gauge and *always* look like half a tank. 😂 Happy Birthday Tom-Tom!
1:23 is Tom suggesting that a working fuel gauge in Matt's fleet is a problem? 😂
Why would they put the sunroof/hatch in there ? Only thing I can think maybe if you drive into some deep snow or something happens to where side doors won’t open you could escape out the roof if your a very small person bc that’s a small hatch 😂
You have a real partner in crime with tom tom!
Hell, I remember when there wasn't back doors. Batteries easy now
Happy Birthday Tom :)🎉🎉🎉  Btw, who the hell design that thing?! Had no logic the battery under all that crap 😂
The skylight is a emergency exit Incase you break through the snow or ice and can't open your door S
Happy birthday Tom!
awesome!! 🙂
Happy Birthday, Tom. Glad to see Bombi getting some much needed love. Adding a winch is long overdue.
Great video. Love the ideas you have for the Bombi
Don't you have a corvair van body lyin around..??
I’d like to say I appreciate your style of ad placement. You use the product, installed the product in an appropriate video, and we get a discount if we buy the product. Thanks MORR!
You gotta overhaul the steering system because that is hot garbage.
I can’t believe you’re actually going to fix the Bombi!!  I would have bet that Matt would waited until a week before a snow storm and then say, “Let’s fix the Bombi”.
How were you not irresistibly tempted to drive it around on the tires?
The biggest takeaway I got from this is if you plan to break things bring Rory. He'll fix them better in a blizzard in the middle of nowhere than you could do in your shop.
Plot twist: Matt built his tow business > to build a successful youtube channel > to finally have a platform to launch his career as a singer.
After all the work on the wrecker...this is going to be child's play for your crew...
I love the difference viewpoints in the beginning.  "fabricator/operator take on the issues and then the engineer's take on how critical they are." 😂
Happy birthday Tom!🎉 Big fan of Matt’s off road recovery from sunny California 😊
Killer BomBee🤣
HEHEHE You guys are the bomb. Cool video
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!
The breaks you mention are actually differential steering  ! The reason you loose them shortly after use is the bands are worn out !!!
Im always torn on these type of things… be sentimental and fix up the old one, or spend less and buy a new one…
I look at the Bombi and I see the Chariot from Lost in Space. Matt, you know you want to.
The bombardier
Happy birthday tom!
Hell yeah! Excited for this build.👌👍
Happy birthday TOM TOM!
You folks are always good for a Sunday laugh, Thank You for the ending! Good luck with all the work and the expense, when it's cold and your miles from any help saving money won't make sense! I hope someone took Peanut for a ride. You all are in my prayers Hoka Hey
Have y'all considered a hydrostat drive like a skid steer? Your maneuverability will go up ten fold.
Goos stuff guys. Happy bday Tom!
Nice to be considered amongst the big brains 😆
Before long Matt's going to be blessing our ears with full solos.
Keep the sunroof  ! They are there in case of tipping over or falling thru a snow valley so you can get out !
Been waiting for this since like 2 or 3 winters ago when you said you were gonna work on the bombi after winter was done. Bouttttt timeeeee.
Cringe @ the end 😂
happy birthday Tom🎂, is it going to be the day on which the Bomby is reborned?
Very nice
Happy Birthday Tom Tom
Put bucket seats on the back facing center...
‘The fuel gauge works’…. ‘We’ll probably fix that’ 😂
Wow, an unknown previous owners  old rigged up fixes had you one spark, arc or wobbled battery clamp from a "Last day ever!" kind of day.
First, overall, I really admire your outstanding ability to self engineer things, your  amazing team and your friends. Having said that, your lack of judgement in some situations is just amazing. I'm saying this as an admirer of you and your channel. Let me get this straight. You are driving the Bombi and smell gasoline SO strong you have the doors open. You proceed to ignore it for quite awhile. Eventually you discover that a line has disintegrated (only because its pouring out on the ground) and  is spraying gas over the battery and hot transmission. Only then do you look for the problem and 'fix' the line (which was the wrong material). BUT, you  don't re-route it away from the battery and transmission. I can only think that God dispatched multiple guardian angels to protest you from yourself.  You could have easily blown the Bombi up in a fireball and killed your whole crew and yourself.
This will be awesome to see the Bombi all done! Its gonna look freakin awesome! Happy Birthday Tom! 🤘🤘
The Spud Truck has all winter...lol
Thanks every one always fun and adventurous
Why don't you just build one from scratch -- sounds easier!!! ROFL
Eh... Maybe just buy a new one???
What a lame ending
Could the hatch be used as an emergency exit if caught in an avalanche??? It is a dedicated snow vehicule after all!
day 2 asking Tom to bring back the monster chops
Can’t wait to see how y’all tackle the steering
I know this is a dumb question -- but with all your "to be" modifications and improvements, is anyone watching to see that the Bombi will be still be STREET LEGAL?
Instead of rebuilding the whole vehicle, buy a old truck and put cat tracks on it.
As always a video!
The ending is hilarious
It's  about  time.  You and Robbie  can have  a bombbie race.
yeah
The spud truck backing up slowly 😂😂😂😂😂
Tom, Happy Birthday.  Ist your Family from Germany?
Keep the back doors you guys added. And, make it go faster too!
We’re gonna build a new bombi
Happy birthday Tom! You have been a great addition to the team!!
Always fun to see these projects.  I was thinking the Spud Truck needs a DuraMax!  Speaking of diesel - a small diesel in the Bombi would be a good fit as well!
I remember all them old videos. And I'm looking forward to seeing it tackling sand, mud and snow 🤙
I always thought you would build one from the ground up! That would be a cool build!!!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom !!    Glad to see that you are upgrading the Bombbee i think that is one cool rig ! Thats going to be a beast when you are done !   It was good to see Mr Ed up and around in this video today was wondering if he was doing ok ?    Y'all stay safe out there and thanks for sharing your adventures with us all ! ✌️❤️🙏
Happy birthday Tom,     And everyone will be looking forward to the resurrection of the Bombe….😊❤
Can’t wait to see the Killer Bee 🐝
Great video
Yours has a problem with a support running across it, but a skylight is intended as an exit if you drop into deep snow, crevasse, etc.
It's my birthday today too 😂
Is that a 4.3 Vortec?? I'm sure its mentioned in a previous video somewhere but it'd probably take me the rest of the decade to find it...
Happy birthday Tom!! Hope you have many more. Also, Red Lobster has really good food
Instead of an upgrade it sounds like a build a new version of it.
Happy Birthday Tom!
That outro, though.  LOL!
I see it now "Killer Bomb-Bee" jumps into action.
You putting a LS in it
So Sweet. I'm just in love with you guys.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom, have a great day
And when are we going to see him in his CROCS? Long live the crocs. :)
Matt and crew be honest when was the last time Matt wore shorts?
I wasn’t ready for that Whistlin Diesel skylight durability test!!!
Battery link? Also, if I am not mistaken,  Ed is a veteran? They have absolutely state of the art tiny hearing aids at No Cost. Just in case he is unaware.
Rudy could probably use those old batteries LOL😅
Raise the inside roof more headroom plus stretch it all the way back
i feel like you should drop a big hydrostatic drive system in there, exactly like a skidsteer. only thing i would worry about is if it can go fast enough for your needs, mabey a hi-lo gearbox for both drives?
Great video again 👍🏽👍🏽. And Lizzy is so hot 😉✌🏽🇺🇸
Seems like it might be easier to just build a new one from the ground up.   I saw someone do something like that with an old huge truck, and turn it into an offroad recovery vehicle.  Maybe they could give you some tips?
This has needed a lot of love for a while now. Good to see it rolled into the shop.
wow
I know this is a project you want to take on, but if you want to be serious with tracked offroad recovery, take a look at getting an HAGGLUNDS BV206, they are available in the US occationally.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM 🎉🎉🎉
my dad had one of these and he had to get new tires, you can use motorcycle tires instead of the expensive replacement ones.
Please put a 5.3 in this
Belated happy birthday. All your wishes shall come true for you.
It was great watching another episode.  Note to self:  Dont buy a Bombi
Awesome. Can't wait to see more videos soon. Keep up the great craftsmanship and hard work my friends. Fab On. Weld Up. Keep Making. God bless.
Loved the outro on this video...😂😂😂
It's not a sky light.  They were built for grooming snowmobile trails which will sometimes cross frozen bodies of water.   It's an escape hatch if you happen to go through the ice and it could save your life in that situation.
There has to be a way to get those steering controls in front of the driver, or maybe a bench front seat so the driver can sit more in the middle. It has to be awkward always leaning to the right. Love the content. :)
HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY HERE'S TO HELPING YOU CELEBRATE MANY MORE WITH MORR😊😁😅
Matt, wouldn't it be nice to have something like skid steer on the Bombi? Or at least hydraulic drive, so you can eliminate a lot of wear parts that could also overheat. But I know hydraulics aren't cheap and light either.
Happy birthday Tom Tom 🎉
This is going to be a great project to watch!! Looking forward to it.
Looks more like '70s to '80s.  With all the work it needs, I would just sell it and buy something newer that fits your needs.
I always watch your video. Happy birthday Tom. What about a set of off road lights on top of the bombi
😂 The end... Hilarious! I wasn't ready, spilt my coffee.
Is the bombi gonna be ready before winter hits
Worn out
Matt, please dont quit your day job to chase a singing career !
Happy birthday Tom Tom 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m very excited to see work finally start in the bombi!!
New name MORRbi
This will be fun to watch
Don't forget the two black stripes down the middle!
i would remove the fueltank to the rear at the place from the cage was, or extende the cab like the one of robby and put the fueltank on both sides of the engine and make a engine cover over it
@5:25 "I struggle with Birthdays, people ask you what you want, you give them part numbers, you open the box, and it's a tie"  -Tom    As a fellow engineer, I feel you Tom.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM TOM!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Man, Lizzy getting old.  I miss Rudy, why he have to get deported to cananadada?     Boooo jake
Wishig Tom-Tom a Happy 😊 Birthday 🎉🎈🎂🎁🎈🎊   Awesomeness  👏 ahead...  We're thinking 💭 FINALLY the Bombi gets the attention she needs and ITS GOING TO BE AMAZING 😉   Keep Up the Great 👍 JERB
HB Tom, may the Killer Bee with you
Matt...how about the fuel tank running across the back of the Bombay??? Maybe a tow system like the World's greatest tow truck???
Repairing a vehicle BEFORE you need it?! GASP AND SWOON! HEAVENLY EXCREMENT! My world just tilted.
I needed to laugh  today  Matt's  good singing love ya All
Hope it was a very nice day for ya TOM!Happy birthday After!!!
Happy belated Birthday TomTom! I hope to one day meet you and all the people I love watching in here  It’s so good to see Ed too!!!
I think you’re cooling system on that machine was not sucking air through the radiator from the outside. It was blowing hot air from the engine  compartment through the radiator. I think that was your heat issue by watching the videos.
Happy birthday Tom tom
I it just me, or do the Bombi "proprietary tires" look an awful lot like solid wheelbarrow tires?
OMG. That ending. I was dying over here.
🤣 ...you give them parts numbers, you open the box - and it's a tie. 😂 Best comment *ever* why birthdays suck.
So going to do any Upgrades????
POOR PEANUT,  so unfulfilled,  lookin for a party... 20:49
😅
Idea...Convert the cargo area (bed) where the expanded metal portion sat to a covered passenger compartment with separate doors. This would allow the gas tank/fill area to be used as a rope/chain/recovery gear shelf. You might even get to move the front  seats back a little for more room.
65.....Did I notice a 65 Corvair 4dr hardtop in blue ??
the newer V6 should give you the power you want
Glad to see you are actually going to finally work on that thing.  When i was out at your place last month, you said you needed to get to work on it before you need it this coming season.  Can't wait to see what you do with it.
Pumped about this build! I'm doing a swap on a bombi right now and interested to see your guy's upgrades!!
Happy Birthday Tom!
Matt... Please just stick to your day time job. Don't sing please.!!!!!!~~!
maybe you need a second snow cat
Hey Matt, im pretty sure your sky light is actually an emergency escape hatch, we have them in our dozers at work because we work in dangerous environments where we could potentially sink, ours are held down with rubber strap latches. Might be worth keeping cuz ya never know!
WOW, you built a new one  !?!?!
The upgrade this segment gave me a good laugh.
Bombi complete rebuild then the Spud truck!  Gotts have the Bombi before winter!
WuTang is forever
@20:20 Peanut is licking  the engine.. I hope that's not coolant?   That can be detrimental....  I know dogs can be just like toddlers some times. we all should be aware of ANIMAL SAFETY  at all times.  Not calling you out Matt, just making you aware
Lives could be at stake that bombi is a mess, you need to restore that completely or I'd stay off the snow that. Seems like half the stuff you do on your equipment is no more to Band-Aid.
TOM!  I'm the same way.... I send links to the exact thing that I want, and I never get it.  Last thing I sent a link for was a magnetic wand to clean up metal chips from my lathe and milling machine, and my kids didn't get it for me. My wife bought it for me after Christmas.... 😢
Great song!!!! When i was young and making love was just for fun!!!
I can’t wait for update videos I’m excited!
This will be an interesting build. My knowledge of snow machines is that they make grrr sounds and chug through the snow like a little tugboat
Killer BomBee Blown 4.3, THM 400, two antennas. Hey Tom, how's Sally been?
Happy Birthday Tom 🥳🥳
I use to wish I could sing but now I wish you could Matt.😅
Happy Birthday Tom!
I would go find a dead Bobcat, steal all the parts and make it fully hydraulic. With a nice Kubota 4 banger diesel.
Here’s your opportunity to satisfy all the "you should put a diesel in it" people. The tracks will offset the weight.
i’d imagine the battery location is to keep it from freezing on a long winter night if the machine is shut off
Hahahahaha good stuff
The ending😂😂😂
What the ??? was going on with that pink Cherokee at 18:21?  In the short video clip it looked like there was no winch cable, nor rope/strap attached - yet the back end was somehow moving sideways, while Matt was looking forwards and not steering...  How? WT??...
This channel is my favorite by far. I watch. Every Saturday morning
Please put a cute bee themed paint job on this beauty~<3
Again, I say a good old fashioned family channel. It's an Andy Griffith /  Duke's of Hazzard type of feeling watching. It's good stuff. The kind that needs to still be around and the popularity of this channel shows it. Great work MOOR crew! Keep'em coming!
The roof vent!! ,,,😅🤣😆. Stretch the cab. Replace the v6 with a 4.8ls. use hydraulic disk brakes over the mechanical drums. Run a big block rad.
I think you should also consider adding a track jeep like Casey LaDelle runs to the fleet. Would give a backup to the Bombi and easier to trailer for lighter jobs.
Been waiting for this rebuild it’s about time!
Happy to see you starting on the Bombi. Are you thinking of maybe putting the Corvair pickup body on it? With the back end of another station wagon body for additional seating? Ha, ha.  Good video, thanks.  Oh, Hello Ed!  And Lizzie, nice to see you again too.
Zach n Micheal deserve a raise on this video alone.  Pure genius.
Finaly 😂😂😂 I waiting this video long time ago 😋😋 watching from Portugal 🇵🇹 always pass and give like, my favorite channel YouTube. ❤️
You and Paul Cox both used the Phoenix bird in your video today.
Matt would full hydrologic, like use a skidstear setup instead of those crappy brake set up be better ? It would be slower but so much more powerful  for sure.   Matt I am so Glad to see PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE! That is the MOST IMPORTANT thing even before making money,  because you cannot make money while broke down in the wilderness or even constantly stopping to wait for it to cool off and wasting time. The most aggravating thing about working for others is they never do preventative maintenance! For some reason they think its cheaper to wait untill it's completely dead and your walking.
Spinning in one place is called neutral steering, and not every tackled vehicle can do it because it makes the transmission and/or running gear more complicated and expensive.
We used a way smaller snowcat with an old VW Käfer/Beatle engine for hunting in December in the Alps. Almost always something broke. But i miss it today.
hbd tom
Hey Y'all. Now we know Matt can sing (kind of)! We never have to hear it again.
4:44 I spy a BBQ to match the wrecker in oversized-ness
Bruh... Just build a new one.
The thing I don't like about it is it is a front sprocket design. So when you are pulling all the force is going through the top of the track around the rear sprocket and then finally to the ground. It would be better suited for towing if the drive was in the rear because the force would be on the drive sprocket/axle and then the ground. I would at least carry a splice section of belt new bolts and beef up the rear idler. Sounds like you might need new brake bands. Online sources are saying the steering shouldn't be that hard.
lol! The ending :)
There is no channel I’d rather watch. This episode has all of the elements I love. Great conraderie, Matt singing, Lizzy, Tom Tom, and Ed. And a build that will be almost as over the top as the wrecker. Keep it up.
Happy Birthday Tom
The new blue truck fading away ! So sad😢😂
you should just purchase a new one. For the amount of work, time, effort it doesn't seem worth it. Plus you don't have enough seating for everyone. The only way to get room is to stretch out the cab.
Looking forward to a number of videos on the Bombi upgrade project.  It's done some good work in its current form and will be even more capable when finished.
Would a track Jeep work for what your doing? Casey Ladelle seems to have good luck with his. It would definitely seat four people more comfortably.
I would bet that ALL of Rory’s trail repairs are still solid 🤘🤘
Happy Birthday Tom!!
Happy Birthday Tom
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM TOM!   Glad to see you guys giving  much needed love to an overlook, essential, part of your crew...of course we’re talking about Bombi!  Who’d you think I was talking about?  Oh yeah, happy red lobster!
Happy Birthday Tom
No comments on Matt drinking V8?😊
what happened to the samurai? seems like that spud truck isn't "all by myself"
I'd put a cam in it ha ha
It's about time you worked on this bomb be by the time you get it done or be next winter
Looked like a good day .. upgrades are Fantastic!!! Yay 4 winches!!!!   Thx for the share & the in depth sharing. Tom happy Birthday  buddy, hope you had a good day & your wish comes true sir🤫😉..         ☕🐢
Happy Birthday Tom! You're probably my favorite member of the crew
Happy Birthday Tom.  In my old family business we owned quite a few Flextrac Nodwell Tracked vehicles. These had rubber tracks with steel grouser bars, they were excellent in the snow and mud but still had the same problem with turning too tight and   peeling off a track. Let me tell you, they never knocked one off on dry land, always in a swamp or five feet of snow.  Can you modify yours to use rubber tracks?
I know where you could get one of them sweet tuckers. Fully running
Man I've only been Red Lobster twice and it sucked both times I never will ever go again
That shot of the tater truck at the end was hilarious
Clutch-brake Differential steering. Brake differential steering. Controlled differential steering. Hydraulic differential steering. Electric differential steering. A lot of options. But which one will Matt go with. I personally would put a dual hydraulic pump, high speed and low speed and then 2 hydraulic motors on the sprocket. You can get a variable-displacement motors that provides variable torque and variable speed. Simple and reliable system, tried and tested...
A very very happy birthday Tom!!! God bless you!!
So a whole episode and nothing but a bunch of talking......
Happy Birthday Tom 🎊 🎉
Hey Tom Tom Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthdayyyy to meeeee ee Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday Tom Tom. Thought I'd give you some obscene about of cash then thought better not so I thought I'd give you a new truck then thought you know that it is the thought that counts. Happy Birthdayyyy 🎉🎉
Happy birthday Tom Tom we love you buddy
I like when Ed's around. Matt talks louder  and that helps me too.
Just finding this channel, what a likeable group of people. New subscriber gained. ❤️
I envy those folks that get to have Matt as their boss, he seems like such a great person to work for
If you want a compact heater look into diesel heater they have a 1 gallon tank that lasts over 24 hours. I wouldn't recommend anything else!
Dude think light bars !
Happy Birthday Tom!!!
Put a old panel tuck body on the  tracks
So I looked it up, and results are saying it’s a 50’s snowcat by the design of it and other cats of the era.
Lots of talking - Not much doing.
Happy birthday tom tom.
Matt, you might be able to upgrade the headlight bulbs in the Bombi to led. If not, I'm sure there are some good options for replacement led lights. I hope you can put a light bar on the top, too, and maybe some for the sides. Surplus Center on Lincoln Ne. has forklift and truck heaters that might work nicer than the one supplied with the machine. As for the tires, see if you can find someone that can fill tires with foam for the old girl. This might be a good option.
Happy birthday tom
8:42 My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.
This build is fiddin to be awesome!!! Let's gooooo!!!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💪💪💪
I think MORR should consider adding some ice spikes to the tracks to help prevent sliding sideways on icy roads. Have Tom Tom engineer some bolt on spikes for the tracks.
This can't be a Matt's Off Road Recovery Video. 25 minutes of video and not once was Lizzy sleeping or eating. Anyone check lately to see if hell was frozen over?
Happy birthday Tom, May there be Many, Many, Many more Red Lobster Lunch’s, because it’s “your” (Matt’s) Favorite Place To Eat!😂🤣 the camaraderie amongst the shop between the mates, makes anyone who can relate envious I’m certain, just as I miss the camaraderie around the shop from days gone by. Enjoy Every Minute, each is a precious Memory you will reflect upon Later in Life.
Killed bee is a burn out car that Cletus has
I hope the Bombi gets a beautiful upgrade. Looking awesome indeed. Keep up the great work. Okay.
Happy B Day Tom-Tom !!   Matt... I love how you heat up your hollandaise sauce in that oil tank !! (@8:45)     Very smart!
😂😂😂😂 the spud truck in the back all sad
Happy belated birthday Tom.
Buy a newTucker.
Anyone else notice that Paul and Matt both mentioned a Phoenix rising in their latest videos? Pretty neat!
Definitely dump the brake based steering and just install a couple hydraulic drive units for each side. Then no transmission needed either. Just a hydraulic pump on the engine. Basically a snow skid steer. Easier to drive, more reliable, probably stouter too.
Happy late birthday Tom, I feel your pain. Happy to see the Bombi, I guess I need to call it the "Killer Bee" now, getting some love. I don't see the link to the batteries in the description.
I've been waiting for this build
Happy Birthday Tom!
You need to test it in the snow this year.
I really glad to see you guys tear this thing down to the chassis, for the years I have been following you guys and seen the rise of the Bombi I have always wondered just what sort of shotty engineering went into it. At least now (aside from the fuel gauge) it has a chance of being properly fixed up.
The Bombi Build will be a fun project!
Super excited to see the bombi get some love!
Why not up grade drive system to hydraulic??
..ohhhhhhhhh!
The Bombi is back!
Cummins 4bt that would be amazing.... small and torque all day
Its nice to see the winter vehicle getting upgraded in the summer and not vice versa...
Lots of talk. Where's the ACTION? 😊  Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Tom
Happy Birthday Tom Tom 🤓👍
Happy Birth Day Tom🎂🎁
"You give them parts numbers, you open the box, you get a tie." I feel your struggle Tom. 😄
Yes!  Been looking forward to this for so long.  I was to the point where I was going to comment;  Snowcat one every episode :D
That oil looks like it’s orange 😂😂😂 never seen that color before
If you’ve got an older f150 extended cab in the yard, you could pull the rear bench and instal in Bombi as back seat.  Should give a good bit of space and not THAT bad to sit on (had a 94 and at 6’1 285 I fit back there)
I have operated and repaired Flextrack. Tucker, Bombardier. The Bombardier had been a groomer and was over 8 feet wide.  It went almost any where but was not fun on a trailer.  It had an inline ford straight 6 in it. Put the steering levers in form of the driver to save your back.  Just under 8 feet wide will maximize your traction and be street legal. I prefer the four tracks and Dodge v8, manual transmission and articulated steering of the Tucker.
back seat needs to bee slim as possible on the back rest wise, while having the max leg space and max comfort on your butt
Hats off at the dinner table boys. 😉
happy birthday tom!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!
Happy birthday tom. I love every video you're with.
Anyone else wanna kick that crutch out from under that new guy and bring back Trevor, skeeter and tucker?
Glad the Bombi is getting its time in the shop. Looking forward to further instalments of this. Were you thinking of moving the steering levers to be in front of the driver? Also have you thought about having a separate cooling system for the brake bands at the front of the vehicle? This could improve the cooling considerably.
I finally figured it out, your Batman! "Where does he get those wonderful toys". the Black and yellow thing is starting to make sense.
Happy Birthday to Tom Tom!!!!
HBD2 Tom, and many more years to come.
Yay, I've been waiting for the Bombi to get some love for ages, can't wait to see what you do to it!
To fix the steering. Remove the brake steer and replace it with a clutch steer. Put a spool in the diff then mount a clutch either side so that instead of trying to stop one side the power is simply disconnected. If there’s room both systems could work together braking the disconnected side as well.
I know where 3 Tucker Sno Cats have been sitting outside for at least 10 years in Washington state and they appear original and complete. They're up in Toppenish, Washington.
If it's a 4.3l gm. Bet you the cap is fried. They short internally
25:05 “Don’t worry, little truck. Matt will get to you at some point too ☺️”
What happened to Tucker and Travis and Ed. Don’t see them anymore
Supercozy memory-lane with Lizzy and Peanut :)
The Bambi bleeds mustard….😂
Happy Birthday Tom!
I just had back surgery a couple of weeks ago . I think I hurt my back again watching you change those batteries all bent over and on your knees :o
Maybe call it the “Really Nice Bee”,  …”Killer” smacks of foreshadowing 😬
Happy birthday Tom!!!
You keep saying Bombi but was this machine actually built by Bombardier? It looks like it was built in a shed.
WOW! That's hilarious TomTom😂😅😂 "Well we'll fix that."😂
Cheers to Full Throttle Battery! Great match for MOOR crew and equipment ❤❤❤ 10:46
Happy Birthday Tom!
It really wouldn't be that difficult to actually make the bombie skid steer instead of brake biased. It would be a lot more maneuverable and probably more reliable too.
why cant you just build drive train and then put banana style jeep body on it??? Bombanana
I'll say it, "I need to mate with LIzzy"...................somethin' special about her.!
Peanut is so cool and it always makes me happy when she's in the video.
would need a new name when its overhauld.
Please let Lizzy go. She is so sad and hurt inside. You need to let her go so she can move on with Her life.
Well Tom is definitely making sure things get done.
Will someone tell me what that armored looking door on the wall is?
One recovey vehicle that seems to be doing his job well blue steel whens his matts off road touches coming. Then the suzuki jimny. That one too when will it be completed. Anyway love the trial an error approach. The way you guys do things. Happy Birthday Tom. Good to see Lizzy and nice memory lane trip with Bombi Matt.
Pruning shears???
Bout time you took care of that bombie
matt  as to your  singing ,,, umm dont  quit your day job lol
1:43 by "fixing that" He means that he's gonna break the fuel gauge?
Happy birthday, Tom. I still kind off visualize you as a chef with a high white chef-hat during the Golden nugget voyage :)
Happy birthday Tom!
I'm actually excited about this build. Plz make longer videos
LOL @ Peanut licking the headers!
Happy Birthday Tom!  You are an asset to MORR!
Happy bday Tom
After seeing the Boombi with out the cab etc. Stretch the frame out for more room inside and out.
Happy Birthday Tom
After a Red Lobster lunch, isn’t it time for a nap?
I think you should call it the BIMBO!
This will be a interesting FrAnKeNsTeIn  build LOL !  Nice walk down memory lane also . Thanks for sharing !
Hi Matt this is David Cotton. I am in Redding California. I'm about to buy my forcing vehicle. Don't know the year yet but it's from my co-worker for $800. It's a Scion  XB and I have no idea how to fix it. That's why I love to brainstorm with you guys. And show it to you guys somehow so you guys can walk me through it because I want to fix it up to make it better and streetworthy
F ur batteries, the old ones, the new ones look cool???😈👽😈
The ending was the cherry on top! Loved it and can’t wait to see the transformation of the Bombi
when things work as they should and are meant to, that's what regulations and guidelines are for,  nothing is wrong with thinking outside the box, such as building a whole new brake system, (or battery brake system) innovation and regulations can work together so people are safe. Good luck on fixing your machines, and Happy Birthday Tom.
Call cletus McFarland time for tbm breaks😂
AKA: Matt’s Off Road Remodeling.
Are you sure yall shouldn't just build  from scratch?
Is the can of V8 foreshadowing a future engine?
U should put the new morver body on the bombi
Best birthday quote ever... "People ask what you want, you give them part numbers, you open the box and it's a tie!"
Finaly the poor machine get fixed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤝
The outro was hilarious! "All by myself"...😢
Happy Birthday Tom.
I see Matt swapping out the Dew for a V8.
Happy Birthday Tom. You da best.
Happy  Birthday Tom Tom!!!
Need to find a used skid steer and Rob the engine and drives from it
Happy birthday Tom!
Well I was wondering when you were going to address the bombi. Can you pressure wash it first, please.  With the fact you burnt your plates, rebuild the transmission and give it a separate cooler. Sounds like the radiator has some serious issues, perhaps a rebuild or upgrade and replace the thermostat, brown water is never a good thing. Besides your the guys (sorry  Lizzy) everyone calls when their stuff fails, your the cut above in that book. You have about 4months till October when snow and adverse weather begins.  Everyone have a good week.  Happy birthday Tom and have a blessed day amen. 🎉
Tom needs to get a better favorite  restaurant!! Red Lobster??? Not good😢😢
"You have a fuel guage that works?...We'll fix that." LOL
Happy birthday Tom.  I know that you are not a fan of diesels.  But as I look at your project the drivetrain from a large skid steer comes to mind.  How ever you do it I look forward to seeing the rebirth
Does this count as "preventive maintenance"? 😁😜
"I struggle with birthdays. People ask you what you want, you give them part numbers. You open the box and it's a tie." Been there.
Happy birthday Tom! Wish you all the best! You guys are awesome!
Wow, Matt your recovery and fab skills are great. Need to work on your singing though!
You make the cab tilt forward or even cooler tilt to the side
It'd be sick to put like a 4l80 and 4.8l in it cheap effective and way Overkill that way you never have a problem again.
Happy Birthday Tom. Your analytical mind is the perfect foil for Matt’s “shoot from the hip” style!
OMG, Matt! The Bombi's mechanicals lends new meaning to the word, SKETCHY!
That ending was hilarious. All through the video I was thinking "what about the spud truck?"
Randomly dropping a bank of cylinders makes me think the ground to that head is not ideal.
Put the expanded metal on the cage on the inside of the angle iron. You won't have jagged edges anymore
How old is tomtom ?
Ypu guys should keep the white wheels too. Looks awesome against the yellow.
Happy Birthday, Tom Tom!!!
mmmm, coffee in the hydraulic system I remember when you got the Bombi...have I really been a subscriber that long?, wow square headlights that at least 1980's
I really wish Tom would bring back his sideburns. Those things were sick!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!!!!!
Happy birthday Tom
I suggest you use Boom Mat, from DEI in that steel cab.  I use it in my hot rods.  The best upgrade was in the steel cab of my Kubota tractor.  I have also used DEI products to build quiet boxes for commercial AC compressor noise control. The sound deadening material is available in various thickness based on your need.  You will be happy with that decision.
You should put like a little S10 bed on the back of it with camper shell or something
Ever thought of putting tracks on a truck and using it for recovery? Like Heavy D Sparks and Murphy's Diesel, who switched their wheels for tracks that work pretty well for snow and dirt.
So we got a call
great ending...real clown show...lol
Best final ever ❤😂
Happy birthday  tom
I'm looking forward to this Killer B build!!!!
Poor old 'spud-truck'. 😂 Great seeing how the Bombi is constructed, though.
I know all too well the multiple projects phase. Poor Blue Spud truck...but the Bombi is cool! Happy Birthday Tom! I'm watching this Sunday morning June 25th, which is my birthday (56). I can't wait to see what is in store for both the Bombi and the Blue Spud truck. I really love the Chevy 67-72 truck body style. I have a few.
Wish you Happy Birthday Tom Tom 🎉🎉😊
Happy birthday Tom 🎂
A Christmas Story was based out of Indiana and not Wisconsin. :)
need a 283 chevy w/2speed powerglide ,sniper fuel injection.
The new name for the the Bombi = L-T-B-A = Luck To Be Alive.
Haha Matt singing love it can’t wait to see that spud truck come alive but the killer bee is gonna be badass
No direct link in description for the batteries, and nothing showing up on your website search results for "FT Series Batteries".
Happy birthday Tom hope you have many more
really looking forward to this series of videos .. Bombi time ! Happy Birthday to TomTom
Can't wait to see what engine you give the "bee"
Make it a 3 seater put the driver in the middle???
Your stories of the bombii…. The guardian angel assigned to you must be sighing in relief at the overhaul happening 😆
Wait Matt is working on a vehicle in the off season.😮
Matt, you NEED that net box back there... Maby you dont remember but you haul recovery ropes and gear back there... 😂
So much appetizer, come on guys give us the main plate….
Happy Birthday Tom.. I'm eating some delicious atlantic lobster right now!!
Matt you need to do a model of the bomby and the wrecker to add to my collection nice work guys😊😊😊😊😊
The poor Spud Truck at the end just doesn’t understand how things work at it new home at Matt’s Offroad Recovery.  The Bombi has been waiting 4 years for its Phoenix like rebirth. The Spud truck will probably be this winters project.
Happy birthday tom..from your fans here in Aruba
Y'all need a skid steer you can cannibalize for a transmission.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!! Can't wait to see the Killer B done. That ending is hilarious with Matt singing All by Myself!! I actually belly laughed at that!😂
I'm pretty impressed, you guys are going to get on the bombi before the snow flies
how can you tell if a track is worn out?
We can tell what you did with all that singing lesson $$$ that Jaymie paid to Michelle!
What about the Chevy truck
Happy Birthday Tom.
The "SKYLITE" should actually be an escape hatch. Here in CANADA these are used in ice/wet areas and require an escape hatch in the roof. Looks like someone mounted a bar across it.
I know toms feeling about birthdays, i was given indicators and brake lights for my downhill mountain bike 😂
Now this is going to be a crazy adventure 😀👍❤️❤️❤️
Mega Axles on the Bombi! aka Killer Bee!
Nice, it needs to be a restomod .
As a fellow engineer, the comment "I give them part numbers, and I open the box and it's a tie" hits home.  You want to make an engineer happy?  Let them pick and buy their own gift.
Grattis Tom Tom🎉🎂
You can lift the cab 1 ft!
Happy birthday, Tom
What’s weather today 😊
We finally found something Matt can't do . . . sing.
Oh jeez, if your oil looks like Yoohoo, you done goofed on regular and timely oil changes
JUST BYE A LEACED ONE MUCH CHEPER  NOT WORTH THE VID.
skylight is an escape exit in an emergency when all other doors are blocked. when you fall thru the ice/snow into an open water lead and can't open the doors you will drown  without a way out the roof. A guy we know lost his son when the HydroAx he was operating went thru the ice
nice reminiscing NOW GET TO WORK AND FIX THAT THING remember......summer will be gone before you know it
I think selling off some junk and buying a real snow cat like heavy D is what you need.
Was the skylight designed as an escape hatch in the case of doors getting buried in a drift or avalanche??? Just curious
OK, if the new name for the Bombi is the "Killer B" than the word "deseret" needs applied somewhere. Just saying.
I gave the video a thumbs up for the working gas gauge.
Happy Happy birthday to you To hope you have a great day later Dannie
You guys keep getting sidetracked….get it…. Sidetracked
the bombi needs a covair van shell
Put a pickup quad cab on the Bombi.
Suggestions: Move the gas tank external to the cage above the engine for easy accesibility and occupant safety. Add cage. The aired tires you use, get them foam filled for no flats.
Happy birthday Tom Tom..... I feel guilty about not warming up to your presence in the channel, now I can't imagine the channel without you....🎤🎤🎹🎹 For he's a jolly good fellow....for he's a jolly good fellow 🎷🎷🎤🎤.... keep grinding 🦾🦾 Nairobi Kenya watching 🇰🇪🇰🇪👌👏
happy birthday tom !
My wife chewed me out last night in front of friends and family. Your show put a smile on my face this morning. Thank you for that. Never give up
Poor spud truck
Exciting news, definitely needs, a engine upgrade, cooling system upgrade, brake/steering. I always wondered why no led bright lights, no light bars, front and back. Couple of those snow storms, looked like you couldn't see much, remember amber lights work better for snow. I run amber lights and separate regularl led lights. I love my 8 gang bus relay touch pad unit. I dont think it was really designed for towing. Look forward to the mods and upgrades  videos.
Wow with all those upgrades it will truly be the Bombi of Theseus
Happy birthday Tom
The Bombi is even cuter without the tracks😁
Any near one-off machine, especially a vehicle, will have problems and be costly to fit and even more costly to remedy!  I'm sure you'll make good improvements and that it will be a bumpy entertaining journey.  Luckily, you're in the right businesses to attack the problem
was like a clip show lol. looking forward to the bombi project. ole blue can wait for now. Winter is coming!
I'm thinking just that of pure meanness you should paint it pink
Always a great show with Lizzy. Other than Matt she’s the last of the crew that built the world’s biggest wrecker.
Matt and Tom Tom make such an incredible duo
Happy birthday 🎉
It need a bigger engine & a bigger radiator.
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Happy birthday Tom Tom hope you had a wonderful y
Happy Birthday. Looks like you had a good time at out with you fellow workers at Lunch.
Happy birthday Tom and me and you have the same problem I give them part numbers and just get a card with 20 bucks saying good luck 😂🤝🏻
Turning the Bombi into the Bomb-Morr (Bomber)
Five bucks says it will never be "finished".
Happy Birthday Tom!!! Having a work partner like you is a godsend for Matt. We all thank the Universe for finding Tom for us.
We have a 74 thiokal IMP, its stupendously loud. Previous owner put a stack style exhaust on it. I have to use headphones or earmuffs. Its exhausting driving that thing to the cabin. It has plenty of quirks. We went through 6 tires this winter. They went flat, got thrashed, ruined the rims. I had to change a tire with 1 spare 7 miles up at the cabin in a blizzard to limp home. (The spare was old and was dead by the time we got down. I could barely lift my arms from fighting to drive that thing straight)
Wait....Wait....WAIT!!!!  Matt's drinking a V-8???.. Are there no vegetables in Mountain Dew??
the ending!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Don't worry Big Blue.... I'm waiting for your heavy build!!
could not help me self...last 5seconds with the SAD spud truck "crying in the Rain" I just burst out laughing'
20% video of real working in upgrading the Bombi and 70% talking and 10% Moorvair
you need an aluminum stakebed  , on the back of it
Happy birthday Tom tom big fan from ethiopia 🇪🇹
✨🙏🌊💙🌎💙🌊🙏✨ happy solar return Tom... love you guy's... happy trails 🙂
I would rethink the front bumper, it will probably get in the way when you begin to climb over something tall like a hard snow bank.
Happy to see this build happen, so many areas to improve on and curious on the direction Matt will choose. Also, the editing is great, especially the last 10 second 😂
Matt complains about battery location in the Bombi and then crawls into the back of the MORRvair to upgrade the batteries to Full Throttle batteries.  🤣😂🤣😂
Battery link??
The ending was absolutely amazing 😂
Why don't you rebuild it on top of a digger chassis or set up like a gamma goat with a secondary engine in the use another snowcat type set up
Morning Matt, Tom, Lizzy, Crew of Off-Road Recovery, and YouTube friends! Happy Birthday Tom, hope you had a wonderful day and had fun!  Glad to hear you have a off-road certified, keeping everyone safe!  Can't wait to see the new killer bee Bombi! Hope everyone have a wonderful day and take care.
Post a playlist for bombi recoveries, so new folks can watch em easy!
I'll bet Ed makes a mean cup of coffee. Good ole boys like that are a dying breed
Lizzy please leave your husband for me 😍😍😍 lol
hahahahahahhaha the end!....
The more I watch, the more I wonder why so many people have left this show.
Casey LaDelle has the right idea with his tracked jeep try that
What? You're working on the Bombi before winter and actually needing it?
Happy birthday Tom hey it’s my birthday in a few days happy birthday to me too  hey Matt it seems to me that it wouldn’t be too hard to convert to a system that steers like a skid steer have a think about it or at least workshop the idea perhaps talking to a few experts on the matter because honestly getting away from what it’s currently like is a bit s%3t to be honest but hey you guys do a great job and I’m sure no matter what you’ll make it work
omg that ending. a++ would watch again.
I would call that an escape hatch instead...
Sweet, hope your upgrading the snowcat to a snowtiger
Hay guys internal fuelling is absolutely illegal. No state will license a vehicle that way😢
Cant wait to see this thing come together, ive always loved snowcats 👌
Expectations far outweigh any disappointment that may arise.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom. 🤯🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Happy Birthday TomTom
The bombi of theasues
Happy birthday Tom!!🎉 can't wait to watch this build series before the snow falls lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Happy Birthday Tom. I've been waiting on these upgrades
Happy Birthday Tom, I have the same feelings about my b day. I've learned to not ask for anything and just enjoy what the day brings.
At 23:05 what old classic is that
All the best to Tom’Tom Cheers min 🍻🎂
Happy birthday Tom! Matt you and Paul must of had some especially going during filming of your Sunday videos because you both mentioned a phoenix and it riding from the ashes and I haven't heard that referenced twice since the Harry Potter movies.
Did you forget to add the battery link in n the description?
OMG Tom's saying that he struggles with birthdays has to be made into a short.
Happy birthday Tom Tom can’t wait to see the bombi get some upgrades
Happy Birthday Tom🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 send me a part number I got you . Within reason of course 😂😂😂
..."you give em part numbers, you open the box, and it's a tie". Hilarious...  Happy birthday!
perhaps you should look into buying a used heavy duty skid steer to steal it steering system for the bambi.
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Hey Matt  You need the Ripsaw by  Howe&Howe These are Awesome you’ll Love’em. Absolutely rapid Can just hear lizzy screaming her head off in one of these 😉👍 Regards Bob
Blah! Blah! Blah!, 🙉🙉, Happy Birthday Tom!, (ya ol'geezer!), thanks for sharing guys.
Fixing a snow machine before it's snowing! Very unMatt
Where's the link for the batteries? :)
Can’t wait to see what you do the the bombe
I was hoping somebody gave Matt a nitrous kit…..
that outro... perfection.
Lol the closing scene with Matt singing is classic lol
will you be staying with metal tracks, or switching to rubber?
This looks like a  fun build, or rebuild.  Good luck  on beating the snow.
Tom's commentary is the best. Please never fire that man.
very cool.  Should be a lot of fun watching you guys upgrade this to be "The World's Toughest Off-Road Snow Recovery Bombi"
Tuned in to see some fab work. Got jawboning and reminiscence of past jobs instead. C'mon man! Give us... you know... the thing!
So are you thinking about hydrostatic drive for the Bombi?
What about the "Bombi-bee" or "Bomble-bee"?
Hydrostatic
Wow 11 people at red lobster that's a lot of money 😮🎉 I bet you it's over $500 happy birthday.
Have been looking forward to La Bombi upgrades!
Happy birthday Tom!
Happy Birthday Tom. So I don't know the price of these but for all you're going to do to this, would it be cheaper to buy a different one?
Happy birthday TOM!!🥳🧓 ...MATT please don't qwit your day job!!! lol
Happy birthday Tom
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!
ha ha ha ah ah OMG The ending was Awesome.. Good Luck Yall
whoa $160 red lobster bill
I feel Tom, Bdays are something private no one should know... otherwise you are force to know others people Bdays and do something about it in return. Bday celebrations should be abolished.
Are you going to replace the welded up stub axle please, I'm just expecting it to break at any time.
Happy Birthday Tom!!!  :)
turn the back seats toward themself so you have legroom
Been waiting for this, going to be a cool build
I think the skylight is more of an escape route.
Where's the battery link?
Redo the complete drivetrain. Similar to a skid steer or zero turn mower. Use hydraulic motors to drive the tracks. The engine would simply run a hydraulic pump. Simple, well tested, robust and lots of parts options/availability. I know some folks I think could help with design, part selection and acquisition if you need that.  I wonder if the folks at Howe and Howe (makers of the RipSaw tracked vehicle) would be interested in getting in on this project?  I have and use an old DynaMow B72 mower. 28HP 4 cylinder diesel Kubota engine, 6 foot deck, mows at about 12 MPH. It's an old BEAST. Drives with a single stick too so I have a free hand (useful for waving at lookie-loos). It's amazing and amazingly simple.
Lol That ending was hilarious.
So you've experienced water in the ol smudge pot..😅... Yup. Me too
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!!🧁🧁🍬🍭🍺🍩🍪🎂🍰
I thought, finely started giving the love and attention to the poor struggling bomby has needed for a long time. And yet there they are sitting on top yapping away, Mike Patey would say "back to work!" Enough waffling there more projects waiting their turn😆
I had no idea that she was such a heart ache.  With that nice paint job, she looked really new.
I know Matt hates diesels but it would be cool to have old school garage build a 4bt for this project.
Hay hay hay  That's Trevor's Song. ..lol...no honing in on  it
24:59 all by myseeeeellllfff
If its going to be Killer Bee you will need to Add Stripes and 2 Antenna
Happy b-day Tom!
Happy Birthday, Tom Tom!!🎉
Lmao. Happy birthday Tom
You need a bulldozer parts hydraulic brakes.
😅😅 when you guys took off the tracks pushed it outside and look like an old Chinese truck 😅😅
Yeah the Bombi definitely needs a work over and upgrade for the recovery's it does. More room in the cabin for people is a must.
Can you fit an LS in a Bombi??? 😂😂
Your Bombi made U S A this mean not to GOOD Bonbardier from Canada ROCK
Yes sure did some work looking forward to seeing the MORRBEE rebuild well done guy's
I could have had a V8!
the tucker sno-cats from the 67 antartic expedition r sitting rotting in a barn in england . they r on an urban explorer u tube channel . if u get in touch they may tell u where and u can see about saving them ... i'm sure it would b no trouble at all for men such as urselves .
I used to like this chanel. Can`t stand tom.
Happy birthday Tom thanks for sharing 👍😀
Bombe is basically a s-10 blazer
Happy birthday TOM TOMMMMMMM🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Matt gonna turn the Bombi into a little M1A1 Abrams. Just put a ton of radiators on the back with another ton of high performance fans and it will sound like a turbine engine for sure.
Joyeux Anniversaire Tom, des pays de la Loire, France.
Happy Birthday, Tom.
Hbd Tom
🎉🎉 Happy Birthday enjoy your special Day 🎂🎂🎂🎂
Happy Birthday Tom. Glad to see the bombing getting the love it deserves.
There doesn't appear to be a link in the description for the Full Throttle Batteries.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom 💛
I’ve been waiting for this series I love this!!! Happy Birthday Tom Tom!!! Congratulation on turning 30!!!!! Lol 🎉
Hanya menyimak Matt... semoga semuanya berjalan lancar...
Maybe you guys can just build a new "Bombi" to match your needs. Is it that different from a 4 wheel drive train?
In the upgrade room category, have seats face each other. If turn 90 and 270
I hate Birthdays too, but happy Birthday Tom
The real question is.. What could replace the Bombi? ... What's that sound? .. Bombi! Why are you laughing?!? 😅
I wonder if the "skylight" is an escape hatch if you break through ice or a catastrophe. But I see a support bar in the way, so maybe I'm wrong.
Happy birthday Tom🎉🎉. Wish you all you wish for yourself. Thanks for going into the history and the recap. Hope it becomes all you need it to be. Take care of yourselves and each other.❤
Happy birthday Tom Tom 🎉🎉🎉 think that's everybody's favorite restaurant even jefes you guys went there last time 😅😅😅
were going to upgrade the upgrades
Chevy 4.3L have PLASTIC fuel injection lines in the lifter valley.  ie you must remove the intake manifold Over time they will crack, leaking fuel into the oil pan.  Should the fuel pump wear out, the engine will fail to start when left to sit overnight. This is due to the minimum pressure required for the injectors.  12v won't generate the needed pressure, yet 14.5v will (jump start). The engine will also start from residual pressure, but will leak down after an extended period.  Aftermarket fuel system, IMO.
Hey Lizzy
World's Coolest Yellow Snow Machine
What in the heck is in Matt's hand? Is mountain dew making a V8 flavor now.
What happened with Ed? Feel I haven’t seen him in forever and he use to be a regular
A Corvair wagon body on top of the Bombardier bottom assembly would look great with lots of room inside for passengers.
when does Ed get a hearing aid device
looking forward to episodes on this.
If your smart now is the time to fix what ever you need to fix or rebuild on the Bombee before next winter while it's warm !!!!!
This is exciting as heck!
Matt with the 🎶all by myself 🎵 at the end killed me! Beautifully done sir. TomTom, Happy Birthday!! I'm sure hanging around that crew you had great day. 🎉
Should the control rods not be moved over in front of the driver. Thanks for some great videos.Translate from Danish with Google Translate 🙂
I'm keen to see the bombi be reborn , I thought it might have been a buick 3.8 in there.  I'd also love to see blue steel get a few mods !   Keep it coming
Just build a new Bombi lol
Is that a tour group in the background at 9:31? That's kinda hilrious, like watching the crew in their "natural environment". They should sell fruit pies to throw to Matt inside his enclosure.
great video greetings from hamburg germany
PRP has some suspension bench seats that would fit in the back.
It kinda seems like almost building from scratch. The only thing good is the frame and body lol 😂
Happy Birthday Tom Tom 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊 🎂 🥳
Happy birthday to Tom Tom 🎉🎉🎉❤
Really looking forward to the Bombi build and how you upgrade each component!
Remember u said comment below what order what projects next looks same thing on what I commented 😅 on that video
You could follow your son's footsteps and build custom tracks for the wrecker. Other than tight space recoveries, it would make Bombi obsolete. Can you imagine how awesome the wrecker would be with four tracks? Especially with the doubler.
So....pretty much rebuilding  everything except the frame? Sounds like fun 😀
What happened to the one guy with the Rudicon. Forgot abt him till the flashback with the cooler lines
use the same value system you used on the off-road wrecker and it will be great!!
What did you do with the money ????....... ........ What money???....... ............ The money that gave you for singing lessons.  ..... 😁😀😵😰😱
I’ve been looking forward to this, I love the Bombi
I am very impressed at how early yall are getting started on improving this before the weather hits. You may actually get it done in time for snow! I love the bombi videos.
Too funny!!! Love you guys!
Buy A New One....
Happy Birthday Tom. I am really looking forward to the upgrades on the bombee. I know it definitely deserves major upgrades and this will be a fun project. You guys have plenty of time as well.  I always enjoy seeing the lovely Lizzy in the videos
So glad that the Bombi is getting some love.
Poor little Ugly Spudtruck getting jealous.
Happy birthday  tom, your a great addition to the channel. 🍻🇺🇲
Just finished the list of bad. I hope you guys dont just upgrade the brakes and build a tripple differential setup to control the tracks
Weight..... helps you through the snow,  it's a catch 22 really.... either good or either bad.......
Matt. Telling a story about how cold it was.  Then it shows a pic of him in a t shirt.  Haha.  Savage
Happy birthday!🎂I hate birthdays too but just know that we appreciate you and all of your knowledge.
Happy birthday Tom!
I thinking for the cooling suck the air in the back so the exhaust doesn't pre-heat the air with a mechanical fan and don't use a trans cooler so the snow can melt off the radiator, Use a coolant to oil heat exchanger
Ls it!!!
When will Lizzie get a ride built? And Jaime too?
going to be interesting what you do to this thing. if it will remain rear engined, get some cooling ducts built in with fans exclusively for pushing air to the radiator. I'd replace the brake steering with something that a Skidsteer has. for the engine, either rebuild the V6 or, knowing you, get another v8 out of a Suburban.
I come here fully expecting this click bait title to end up as a simple oil change, done with a twig and sap chewing gum.
COSTA RICA ....VERY NICE TO SEE GRANDPA...THE IMAGE OF LAZZY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TIME TO SEE YOUR CHANNEL...AND GREETINGS TO ALL HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM TOM.
Happy B'Day Tom.
I flinched when Matt reached for those exhaust pipes.
Hate the snow but love this snow thing. Would be expensive at around 15k for just pumps and motor but hydro would be perfect for this. Might also look at how a D10/11 steering works too, it's impressive and complicated but wouldn't be impossible if two differentials were tubed into one axle. Spool one diff and locker the other' you can keep the brakes but find a way to lock your second pinion shaft in place and you're spinning in place 😏 poor man's Dozer steering .
that "skylight" is a fresh air vent, not really a skylight.
why don't you get a set of tracks for the Banana
Why not make the engine drive a hydraulic pump with a drive motor at each rear wheel?
The bombi project looks supper interesting guys!!  I think the roof hatch is actually an escape hatch...  lots of these bombardier snow cats were used by commercial ice fisherman on Canadian lakes so if the ice broke they had an escape hatch to got out of the machine before it sank!
Tom is very nice, but Trevor is still missed a lot
You need a bigger shop! Can’t wait to see morr on the bombi
Happy Birthday from Germany, Tom. 🎉
I would have to relocate those steering sticks into a more comfortable position, preferably in front of the driver. You could go all crazy like and change over to a steering wheel setup 😛
Oh my.  Throw it away and buy a new one… cost benefit analysis.
Happy belated birthday Tom! God bless and stay well.
Spud trucks need love too
The “skylight” is a safety feature, it’s an escape hatch for if the machine breaks through the ice and is stuck with the doors jammed.
Blue truck will come later. Bambi is in BAD need of rebuild.  Looking forward to this.
Love you guys! Happy birthday Tom
I immediately thought of the abominable snowman on the old Rudolph Christmas cartoon, tasting his pick axe when Matt pretended to taste the bombi dipstick 😂
Happy Birthday to Tom
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Tom Tom, lmao at the last part, "all by myself" 😅
But its not snowy right now! 😢
Lizzy!  Part-time Superstar!  Good to see Ed again also, the main man.  Happy birthday Sir Tom Tom!  Gongrats to the Bombi, finally getting the rejuvenation it needs.  Oh yeah....Attaboy Matt!
Curious what you're doing with the steering transmission?  Shouldn't be anything more in the stock box than a typical rear truck axle.  Though the oil cooling theoretically is nice.  Maybe add a water mist system on the steering brakes like racing semi-tractors use?  Another cots option would be to steal the hydro static transmission from a large skid-steer.  You can also DIY a proper tank transmission out of two truck axles.  But maybe that is a bit two far into the weeds for a work vehicle?
One of the best endings yet 😂😂😂😂
killer bees
Bombi needs an exo caged with spot lights at every corner it would complete the look of it and after seeing you remove that cab there's not much protecting you in a roll over
Feliz cumpleaños Tom! I appreicate everything you contribute to the channel.
The Bombi without the tracks on those small wheel reminds me of those funny railroad utility car.
You might like to consider changing this to LPG Dual Fuel. As Gas degrades before the next season. LPG stores for decades. And change that Radiator  and add fans and a cabin heater.
“It’s going to be a good family vehicle”. Should be a decal on the side
I swear Matt is having way to much fun while working damn if everyone could love what they do like matt
If I  were making improvements to this thing, I  would put the driver directly behind the breaking handles then add two smaller seats on either side.  This would give more room to the backseat occupants and make driving easier.
Finally i have been waiting years to see the bombi get some much needed love
sounds like your building a whole new machine.
i could just listen to yall talk all day long, loving this channel
Happy belated birthday Tom.  You are awesome.
Suggestion.. Throw some sound absorbing material on your shop ceiling. Best thing I ever did in my shop. Would be perfect for recording videos too.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎉 Tom-Tom Have a good one.
I wouldn't think Jamie would need very much legroom. Being vertically challenged myself i can say things like that 😁   So Jamie. Lets sue the state for building the sidewalks so close to our hind ends 😂
The bombi needs to do slip lock if it ever has snow on it!
Have you thought about talking to Casey and adding tracks to the Tangerine?
Happy birthday Tom.  I like, and can relate to, the part number comment - I just give folks links or let them watch me order my birthday present from them :)
Why not add two more crew seats by reducing size of rear wire basket area and make it look like the tracked vehicle in the Lost in Space TV series?
Going full hydrostat?
need a hovercraft
Happy Birthday Tom! I hope you had a good one. Looking forward to watching the upgrades being done on the Bombi. She really needs some work. I remember watching the video when you were recovering that Toyota Tacoma and you kept taking panels off and stopping every few minutes to cool the engine down. What an ordeal. The Bombi will do those types of jobs no sweat when you are done with her.
If you don’t stay until the last second of this one you are missing a treasure.
The skylight is probably an emergency exit if the thing gets buried in an avalanche.
Scouts👍
Happy Birthday
The end song was perfect 😂
Really like the videos, and having your wife so active in the business. Please don’t hate me but the comedy thing going on with Tom is getting old.
love you all hapy birthday tom from south africa
Happy birthday Tom  Tom,  I'm wondering how old you are
Happy Happy Birthday Tom Tom!
I don't know what happened to this channel - it used to be so wholesome and sweet. So much Hate in todays episode...but I guess it leads to more Love. Great job guys, and happy birthday Tom.
21.12 The Lizzy 🥱
Time for the Bombi to earn that MORR yellow !!
Happy birthday Tom Tom!!!🎉
out of intrest, and i know it wsaent mentioned but whould would it take to convert it from the current style of break steer to a more modern skidsteer style. i know you wanted to simplefy everything, i just think with the added horsepower with the engine upgrade it could do with it. that and on wide rubber tracks i think itll do sliplock and waterfall
So open that wallet and let some of the moths out and just go buy you one of those Tuckers and paint it yellow ... In the end you'll probably save $.  Okay, won't be as much fun as a complete rebuild though.
Put a skid steer hydraulic drive system on it so you don’t have to use brakes to steer. I’d also drop a diesel engine in it.
Those vortex engine has spider injectors that are junk. I bet that's your problem.
That was good! Haha
It was like a trip through memory lane going back to all those recoveries 😂 Excited to see what you guys do with it!
Tom has really come a long way in a hurry. Be careful that he doesn’t start his own channel.
Happy Birthday Tom, you are a great addition to the MORR crew. Anxious to see the build on the Bombi.
Really enjoy the “behind the scenes”, the history and how you bring us into your world! Very cool!!
Use the engine to drive a hydrostatic pump driving a left and right hydrostatic motor.  Then you can use a steering wheel to operate a left and right diverter valve to stop each track in order to turn.  A foot throttle gives you your speed and a brake pedal can operate a vavle to lock up the motors.  Clean, simple, doesn't take up much space,  relatively simple to service and repair.
I like to see it with r2.8 Cummins /th400 with vintage air conditioning and heat.
Tom Tom is the liquid nails that holds this team together. Good work man. Happy birthday. And Cheers.
Boop
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Spark or fuel
Maybe I'm missing the link for the Full Throttle batteries? I don't see it in the description.
The Bombardier Bombi was designed for grooming ski hills and snowmobile trails. Other great Canadian made Bombardier products include CanAm, Ski-Doo, SeaDoo, Rotax, AlumaCraft, Quintrex and Mantiou plus Challenger and Global business jets.
Please be a Cummins 4bt swap with a 5 speed manual
I'm thinking a V6 drivetrain from like an 2012 Impala, mounted north-south with the steering system from a skid steer might be the way to go. Maybe mount the V6 east-west and have it drive the back of the tracks instead of the front. It'd be more compact, allowing the passenger compartment to be made larger. It would also have more power and be lighter, as I think those V6s are aluminum and were rated for 300hp. With a skid steer system, perhaps you could use a regular steering wheel hooked to a power steering box to direct flow to the correct side of the Bombi to drive it. That would make it easier for just about anyone on the crew to use it for jobs. Coupled with an automatic transmission for the V6 and some brakes mounted inboard to the axles, it'd be almost a car-like driving experience.
A fuel gauge that works! Unsubscribed.
Link to batteries???
24:43 maken Canadian madness better, 👌👌👌
Happy Birthday TomTom🎂🥳  I'm excited to see the Bambi get its well deserved upgrades.
Didn’t see the battery link.
Great project in the making , love it ..Happy birthday Tom !
Looking forward to this build! 😊
Name it MORRBI
Best thing about this video is peanut trying to walk on that 2" square tube😊😅
Story time with Matt and Lizzie.  I like it.
Wow story time with Matt.
Happy birthday Tom🎂
Happy Birthday Tom Tom Hey Matt you should put a xj body without the nose on the bomby
ED !!!!!!!!
Poor spud truck. Jilted by Matt for a Hot Wheels hot mess. Life ain't fair.  😁
Happy Birthday TomTom!  You guys should do a Bombi shirt that is blueprint of all the upgrades and dimensions  of the Bombi as described in the video
Happy birthday Tom, hope you had an awesome day.
Zaa a ag 😊😮o Lilo😂t o
This is probably the way the Thunderbirds got started
All by myself... lol!
Ummm..... it's not a sky light, it's an escape hatch. You may want to secure it better, but don't delete it altogether.
You forgot to put the battery info in the description.
Could properly save some weight with some light weight seats.
Ah. The spud truck is going to be left out. Bombi fix is needed. Have fun and go wild.
Looking forward to following the Bombi build.
With your team, Matt heck, yes, everything is gonna be just fine by wintertime again!😊
I always watch Matt's videos last as they're the perfect antidote to all the doom & gloom.
need a sperry vickers pump and two hydraulic motors. Skid steer style
FYI ~ I’m on an iPad a do not see the Full Throttle battery promo code.
🎉HAPPY BIRTHDAY🎉
As you mentioned the control difference in the video, are there any plans to swap out the brake steer system for a fully hydraulic "skid steer" system? Perhaps find a donor skid steer or mini digger?
after the rebuild can it rescue a bull stranded in the mountains ?
Will be nice to see the snow cat competition with Robby and Heavy D. . It’s odd to write that in June though.
Looking forward to this rebuild!
Lemme lemme UPGRADE ya!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎉🎉🎉TOM
"Fuel tank that's part of the driveshaft protector". I can't see how anything could go wrong with that design.
Oh my God that's a killer song
Happy Birthday, Tom Tom
Happy birthday TomTom.
Happy birthday tomtom
I won’t ever forget when you guys brought the bombi out to Huntington canyon to pull out my Jeep TJ right after Christmas. I was covered in feet of snow
Happy Birthday Tom  🎂🥳😍  Love from LK
Love rules
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!  Eddie
Why not just buy a Spaz, paint it yellow and be done with it?
That battery location is insane!
My 2 cents. I ask why are the primary steering devices beside me. I want them in between my legs ? Bench seat ?
I am definitely NOT looking forward to winter already, but at least we will have something cool to watch when it comes,,,,, THANKS MATT !
I will toss in my 2 cents put a xj body on it i believe you got a few kicking around
Happy Birthday Tom Tom!
Happy Birthday Tom
hay matt what motor is in that bombi i get a glance at it and it kinda looks like a buck V6   well a ecotech over here in austraila
Happy birthday Tom (part no. Zz704- Drink hold/Gas filler, glug glug, ha ha ha)
That ending. 🤣 Poor spud truck. ☠️
Quality work with minimal parts, very few tools, questionable equipment, and in the middle of nowhere is my specialty.
Happy birthday Tom Tom
Damn, pauls video, robbys video and matts video were all lame and boring today.
That old chevy just sad lol
Happy B day Tom Tom
Obamanol
The Bombi of Theseus - if every part is replaced, is it still the same Bombi? Haha, great work and happy birthday Tom
The world's largest off-road rollback will be a good winter project anyway.  Let's Go Bomb-Bee!  💣🐝
It seems like you could sell the snow cat as is for enough to buy a new set of tracks that fit your other two 4 passenger rigs that already have all the good parts and a better top speed.haha
First gear makes 3 miles feel like 15
The Bombi needs a 500hp 383 stroker sbc  !!
Happy birthday Tom-Tom!
U guys rock!
trust fall................... OMG    Sketchy Rescue is doing maintenance? fixing instead of bitching? eye roll fall off my scooter.............looks like ford engineering design
happy bday tom, ur one of the reasons i watch the channel
Just buy a new Snow Cat😊 Happy birthday Tom Tom 🎉🙂🎂
Who woild have thunk , that morvair had two , 51r Honda civic batterys 😊❤
Happy bday Tom!
👀
Matt is right Tucker snow cats are sick!!!
Happy Birthday  Tom
Did you "we're gonna upgrade this" the snow tracks 3 times?  Lol the humor is why I stay here.  I love MORR 😄20:37 Im pretty sure this clip was the first video I watched of the channel!
SUN ROOF Because these machines at time travel across frozen lakes the sun roof can act as escape hatch if it falls through. Yours has a bar 👀 that would keep most anyone from going out that hatch.
"you give them part numbers and you open the box, and it's a tie" ROFL
I'm surprised you didn't re- body it with something from the 40's or 50's.
Tom Tom should get best supporting actor this year. Lol.
Phenomenal and yes about time the Bomb Bee gets some much needed Lovin.  Really wondered why you liked it so much,  thought you guys would eventually get one of those ski resort  snowcats with the monster 6 ton winch on the center post.  Not a large one but you know one with some pulling power.   Can never have two to many cats on a job!!
Happy birthday, Tom. You make the channel better, both with your quick wit and your positivity.  edit: lol i love the stingers you guys have been putting in.
“How dare the fuel gauge work?” Doesn’t it know? Matt doesn’t have fuel gauges that work! Seriously!!!😅😅😂 Also, Happy Birthday Tom Tom! Hope this is the best year ever!🎉❤🎉🎉
About time 😂,, but poor tater truck 😢😢, 😂😂
Top notch Finale!  Should be 📀 for sure!
Great video…it’s great seeing all the work taking place on your fleet of vehicles
JUST GO BUY A LMC you will be WAY AHEAD in the SNOWCAT WORLD
Love the love! :)
Happy Birthday Tom..... Happy Re-birth day Bombi!
Engineer 1: where is the dumbest place we can possibly put a battery?  Engineer 2: hold my beer…
Sky light is a escape hatch required in Europe
The army M88 tracked wrecker has a spade on the front. I could see something similar (made out of a light duty snow plow or something) being crazy useful on this rig.
Steering… look hard at the steering controls/system on a small Bobcat MT100
I waited all week to watch some Sunday morning action videos. Everybody just talking. You talked half of what Robbie Layton did, and it doesnt sound like an infomercial, but Sunday mornings are like when you typically put out your most productive videos. I love your fabricatio. Videos. I want to see this full refit of this machine and see it work epically. Good job with rhe disassembly
No link for the batteries?
I'd probably leave the sky light. It may be an escape point sometime
6:57 what?  Does anyone else sea that the gas lines run over the battery???  Isnt that normally an issue?
Replace the Vortec with a corvair flat six. That might give you a lower profile to extend the cab back for more space.
I havent finished this episode yet and i know weight is important but i think i would just restart with a small truck crew cab and flat nose the front at the fire wall. S10, dakota, tacoma, or similar. Plenty of room, sound deadening, hvac, wipers, ect...
Call it the Zombie Bombi
I might have to "borrow" that cup holder/gas cap combo.
Happy birthday, TomTom! The skylight is for ventilation of gas fumes, most people ride with the doors shut in subarctic areas
Glad to see your overhauling your snow machine.  But at the end of this video making the Tater truck sad was too much sir.....
Good to see the bombi getting some mods and great video keep up the good work God bless from GA and stay safe
So what you're saying is... You'll fix everything but break the fuel gauge? 3 minutes into the video but this is what I predict
Imagine taking that to Autozone for a free battery installation 😂
Happy Birthday Tom Tom, also can relate on how you feel about birthdays.
How about putting the fuel tank up where the basket was?
Happy Birthday Tom, Always wishing you the very best!🎉
Happy birthday, Tom Tom!
I’ve been waiting for this rebuild for a while now..
well it was a decent tear down video but then you just sat down and started reminiscing... 👎
congratz tom
Happy Birthday Tom! Hope it was a good one brotha! ❤
Happy Birthday, Tom!  5:28 Part numbers😂!
Happy birthday Tom. Love your energy and vibe. Never stop being a Tom!!
Happy Birthday Tom!
Happy Birthday TOMTOM. Great video. made me laugh a lot. thank you
Happy Birthday Tom !
im glad the bombi is getting love but PLEASE throw some fenders on the wrecker, yall be talm bout it every recovery lol best wishes matt!
Did I see Matt drinking a V8!?
Happy birthday Tom
What would the new One cost
For the cooling we used to drill holes in the thermostat on our racecars, and it worked well.
I don’t know if it’s Tom- Toms influence but it seem like Matt is finally doing preventive maintenance and repairs on his equipment. Life is a lot of easier when things work the way they are supposed to, allowing you to focus on the actual job👍
Did a single person in the group actually order lobster? HBD Tom!!
Okay, check this out………….use the wrecker as an anchor and see if killa b can get up sliplock, but you can use the front winch to aid in getting up it. If you need to.  Lol
It would be interesting to see a turbo from a PowerStroke diesel on that 4.6. Just like Roadkill did with the Rotsun
This Bombi rebuild project will be the most interesting, most watched series of all your projects and rescues.  Mark my words!
all your (family/friends/fleet/crew) are awesome, please explain your coolant system "in details" for the WRECKER..
Love it but why not also get some tracks (like Casey) and have a tracked Banana through the winter
Team Vibe, Format, Editing….. Perfection. Love watching, Thank You
You should think about putting a Mercedes turbo 4cylinder diesel in it and have great reliability
Don't cry blue Chevy, you're in the que, Bombi;s been waiting a while....................
Happy birthday Tom Tom
🎸🎸👍
I think it's great that whenever you see Jamie........she always has a smile.  Brightens up every video.
Would tiny longitudinal brackets on the track irons make it less prone to slide sideways on a slope, no wider than an inch?
As a Mexican trying to learn English, this video has been helpful for me in learning the difference in pronunciation between "this" and "these" 😅 Great content as always
Are y’all gonna just sit there and talk all day or do some actual work on the thing?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Tom! 💖🎉🎂
I like the obd Ford mirrors 😊😂😂😂
It was good to see Ed.  Does he use the Golden Nugget to cruise around town?
Have you thought of Diesel heaters they use in motorhomes .
Lizzy says to matt when's your goal to have it finished matt says by winter 🤦 projects on his channel get started but nothing ever gets finished so how are they going to have it finished by winter😂😂😂😂😂 I love this channel I do the exact same thing ❤❤
Looking forward to see it come together, and be on its first job. Good luck (fabrication) have good one all of ya
Happy Birthday Tom! Wish you nothing best for you!
Lmao, that outro. AND working on the Killer Bee before snow falls?!?! what channel am I even watching rn😂
Happy birthday 🎉
Looking forward to the upgrade, but it would be quicker to build a new one.
Why dont you just get Traxxas already that can go on any car
Happy Birthday Tom!
Happy birthday Tom 🎉
Ditch that “Tinker Toy” and get a real snowcat
Offroad certified???? You use to run the most janky suspension set up on the banana and it did great for you. Thats probably when your channel was the best. Now your channel is about 54 inch tires with doublers. 😬 Oh and rear steer too.....
Happy birthday TOM
wonder if you could offset those brake controls to the driver side to make it more comfortable to operate.  maybe use a jackshaft configuration or tube in tube setup.
it'll go up the horseshoe falls it may just need to use the winch and maybe the off-road wrecker for an anchor but anything is possible if you bend the rules enough
happy birthday tom and it's great to see Ed always  looking great.  working on the  bombi will be good  have it updated and  working  lights,wipers,heating,brakes...great video 📹  thanks for  bringing us along new batteries for the morvar...
Maybe call it “The MORROMBI” :-)
Happy Birthday Tom!!
Happy Birthday TomTom! 🙏😎🤙🛻💨
Happy Birthday to Tom!
Any thoughts on hydrostatic drive and steering?
On-Board AIR stored in the frame.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom. You're starting to come out of your shell and shine. Your input is great coming from a fresh set of eyes and knowledge. Never thought i'd get used to the changes in crew but i'm warming to it. And get them to fix all their broken glass!! Ta
Phoembi? Bomnix? Phoembix?
24:40 With that name all authorities will be keeping a close eye on you from now on... 😅  You better not be buying thick metal plates from now on... 🤣
Happy Birthday Tom! 🦀🦀🦀🦀 No tie this year...looks like you got crabs! 😂🤣😂🤣😂👍🏻👍🏻
Happy birthday, Tom
Happy DayZ Tom%<><🎉
Happy belated birthday Tom! You are a blast to watch
For what you will spend in time and money you could get a newer machine that has all the things you don't like fixed and the the things love already in place. I always thought that snow machine from the 60's was going to be a huge problem.
Happy Birthday Tom Tom - Belated
Matt, talk to Motion Raceworks and see if you can't get them to build a set of TBM brakes for that thing, if those can hold up to drifting they can hold up to the brake steering on that.
Can't wait for this and the spud truck now. Please make the spud truck insane with those giant axles TomTom got 😂
I wonder if MORR will stretch the bomb-be a bit for comfort? 🤔 Who knows and we’ll definitely stay tuned in for this build. Thanks for sharing
Good morning everyone it's another sunny beautiful day out here
storytime with lizzy and matt..sweet
That's not a sky light, it's an escape hatch....😅
I see a Sherp in their future!
I miss my Tucker 443 SnoCat, but Never really used it.
I really like how seamless your product placements are! They are actually helpful.
Happy birthday Tom tom!! You by far are one of the bolts that hold the crew together. Thanks for being you man and I hope your birthday was a good one
So happy for another build!
Always, Always repair your equipment before putting up for the season
The fuel filler is INSIDE the cab??  What could go wrong?
Will you complete it this time? 😂
"We're going to upgrade THIS".....  points to every single part of the Bombi
Don't rebuild that old machine. It would be cheaper and better to buy a newer machine
Can't wait to see the final form of this thing.
Great idea doing all this work in the off season ☺ Happy Birthday Tom... is the "tie" at least yellow???? 😅😂😅 Memories of Trevor's work on those treads and Rory's repair too... Looking forward to the Phoenix Super Bee
Here's your YouTube algorithm booster commentary. MORR win.
I dro e a tracked vehicle in the Army, check out the M113
Happy birthday Tom Tom respect from the UK
Congratulations Tom, keep up the good work.
Lets Go! I have been waiting months for this!
happy bday to Tom. I really enjoy his wit.
Tom has quickly become my favorite on your channel (Jamie is a close second), keep up the good work MORR crew!
I would put a Skid-steer diver-train instead of all this junk.
FINALLY some Bombi love!!!!  I think I’ve got goose bumps!
The sunroom was for it when it was cleaning snow off of lakes and that was the way out if went through the ice  the driver could open and swim to the top
Red lobster has an awesome berry mango daiquiri
I walked into Red Lobster once. And ran out the door, when I realized that everything at this restaurant could easily be categorized under "massive price gouging". Only a fool would pay red lobster prices for food. That crap is ridiculous.
LOL ... Sing on ... Love it !!!!!
Control modules bad don't argue with me just change it. Supposedly they either work or they don't, wrong experienced it too many times.
Bad idea at 7:50.
Well, Happy Birthday to Tom.
Happy to see that you finally found the time to rehab the Bombie……………..  what?  You aren’t done yet?
Its Nickname should be the Bomb-Bee due to its yellow color.
Happy birthday 🎂
Happy birthday Tom!!!!
Bombie rear engined, corvair rear engined... put tracks on a corvair!
I've always appreciated the humor, the realistic approach to building and fixing machines, as well as the approach to safety that you promote, but the BEST thing about being a long-term subscriber is seeing how you treat your people and the community. You guys are always doing something good, right, uplifting or all of the above. Well done and thank you. The ignorant world we live in NEEDS you now, more than ever.
Sorry Tom , but after watching "Leon the lobster" videos can't do red lobster anymore. Happy Birthday.  Go Leon...
Tom: I give them P/N’s and I get ties!!🤣 That thing was really easy to disassemble.
Happy belated birthday from a complete stranger 🙃
Right on MORR  we have been waiting for this get it stripped down and now you have a blank canvas,  you have had some time to think what needs to change. We are excited.  Central California watching.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!!
Happy Birthday Tom Tom! Also cool see the Bombi get so much love. Enjoyed see what goes into a snowcat as you took it apart
I anticipate that this series will prove to be captivating, and I am eagerly looking forward to witnessing its outcome.
Imagine putting old school mini van cab on top of this snowcat...not just gonna looks awesome,but interior space gonna be huge as well
The first episode of building a completely new and different, yet same, vehicle from an old vehicle.
Hell ya
I love how your voices slurr after lunch. Definitely had some brewskies ;) happy birthday Tom!
A working fuel gauge? We'll probably fix that. - Tom 🤣
😂
Thank you from Kentucky ✌️
Ever consider putting jeep tracks on the Bombi? 🤔
The fuel gauge works…. “We’ll probably fix that!” 😂😂
I'm glad the Bombi is getting love, but I feel bad for the spud truck.  I hope it doesn't sit for a year before it gets some love, and I hope the Mega-Axels that Tom bought while you were getting the Corvair end up on it.  Spud truck - transforms into WLRRF (World's Largest Razor Recovery Flatbed), with crane - to just pick them up and place them on the flatbed.
That WiLL be spicy in the ol’ smudge pot! 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love watching your project videos like this one!
Red Lobster for TomTom?? Well deserved!! Congrats
It needs a 4BT Cummings!
It was INDIANA not Wisconsin
Can't wait to see the build!
Can’t wait to see it finished!
Tom: "You have a vehicle with a working fuel gauge?? [...] Well,  we'll probably have to fix that."  Not sure that's what you meant,  but thanks for the laugh Tom! 😂
Jeremy Renner might agree.😚
Why dont you just finish one project..the morvair still needs work on the interior as does the heavy wrecker🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Agree Red Lobster is good, Happy Birthday Tom Tom.
Inside first 20 mins
Hi, I noticed that the dogs in the background sometimes when you are actively welding in other videos. Are you ever worried about their eyesight being impacted. I’m learning to weld and won’t let my dog in the garage while I practice.  Thanks
Hell yea another birthday to be in paradise 🎉
ALL YOU CAN EAT SHRIMP 🦐........THANKS TOM
So the Bombi's pronouns are that/this/these lol Happy Bday Tom!
With all the new upgrades, will the upgraded name be "The Shining Bombi"?
Matt seems like such a nice dude to hang out with tbh
This is an amazing project.  Really looking forward watching you upgrades these. 😅
Happy Birthday Tom! God bless you.
Convert it to hydrostatic drive snowcat
'Big brains' all saw you pulling it in at the end of an older video!  Fullriver!   next you'll be running Sherpa winches ♥ +4 on the Eric Carmen  lulz
So basically you're upgrading everything? ;)
Happy Birthday Tom, mine is tomorrow. 26th,
Not sure if it even works this way but how did the early cylinder deactivation operate and would that motor have ever had that option.
Happy birthday Tom
1:03 Maybe that's an escape hatch for when you bury it in a swamp and can't open the doors.
This will be just as cool as the wrecker build!  What a cool little machine!
happy birthday Tom
I KNEW those sticks to control the bombi looked familiar,  they are shafts from adjustable length garden trowels, i have 1 in my garage i bought in 97 lol
@Matt; A Battery Disconnect Switch might be a good upgrade for  Contingencies Control IE: Electrical Shorts, (Unplanned) Parasite Draw, Fire Suppression.
Tom , your first 18 birthdays are cool the next 3 are ok the rest just sucks .
I spat my coffee out at @5:27
Happy Birthday TOM!!!
Fall Line is not too far, for tires and sprockets!
The working??? fuel gauge has to go............ 😂😂
@8:34 Matt just whips the nut into the cab and Tom looking on in disbelief! haha!
swap in a nice 4.8l turbo diesel,
YES YES YES
It's about time,,,,lol
Honey mustard
So basically you’re going to tear it down to the bare chassis and start over.
Please go back to you previous format and skip the attempt at humor
I do not see the battery link
Now you have to get Robby to fix up Whiskers and you two can have a mini snow cat race.  Happy birthday Tom!  Hope you got the part numbers you wanted.
Happy Birthday Tom
HAPPY BIRTHDAY YA LANKY ENGINEER!
3:03 Full stop. 😂
yes needed a MORR video rn
Complaint heard, yawn.  You built your own wrecker .  None of you can fix a simple gas gauge.  Sympathy not here
Happy birthday tom
The Bombi of Theseus.
TOM ADDS SO MUCH TO THE CREW.  HIS ENGINEERING BACKGROUND REALLY HELPS COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS.  HE AND MATT WORK SO WELL TOGETHER.  WILL MAKE THIS PIECE OF RECOVERY EQUIPMENT AWESOME.
I seem to remember you putting a smaller radiator in this lol.  This thing is pretty cool.
Sooooooooooo, what you're saying is you need to buy a newer 1 n save time n money it's seems....................
happy birthday! TOM :D i know it's late :P
ONE switch is the EJECTOR SEAT and one is for SMOKE SCREEN... have you never watched james Bommbie???
OMG.  They're working on the Bombi before it snows!  Like doing maintenance on the vehicle before it's needed!  How novel!  😁
Always remember,  if you are considering surf are turf. The tail of the lobster is the toughest meat in the whole bug, i know lots of people who wont eat it.
Vortec 4.3 just carry 5 ignition  modules
no!  tracked jeep man!
