Eugene is STUNNING in that colour!
I’d be cool if u did a new version of these try videos today. With how much I grew as the try guys and as people in general it’d be very interesting and cool and nice and cute and funny if u did that!❤❤
5:02 Zach who are you kidding I feel like you’ve worn several dresses
Kelsey is sooo annoying... the first guest try guy i hate... she is nothing like keith... he is always focused on his project n doesn't try n sabotage others... she is just soooo dumb and annoying 🤨😠... she put 0% effort in her dress n was just selfish to zach... ooo my how much i hate her...
Kelsey is a little too much for me. She's pretty; funny and no fool, but comes across a over the top. She could be such a more valuable asset to the brand if the swearing and derogatory fun play was turned down. Love the vids anyway.
Eugene is the embodiment of "I've never done this, but I'm gay, so how hard could it be"
Why is Zach such a good photoshoot director?
With every video I watch I grow a bigger crush on Zach. He just seems so sweet and in the moment and great to spend time with. Btw he has a talent for photography and camera angles. Does he ever do photography or cinematography or directing?
My grandma wore moomoos around the house all the time 🫶🏽
Nothing more punkrock than F#$%^ your employee!
Kelsey is giving angry drunk,  like i get its some people's way of joking.. just doesn't feel like it fits the vibe
Ya if you have the spirit of J Lo inside you.......  You would steal someone else's dress
Itid1878 s good video but they say that try guys but there is actually a woman in there as well
PLEASE HAVE KELSEY BACK
I love Kelsey here hahahah you should have her added more
Kelsey is annoying as fuck
As an Asian, Zach's dress looks exactly like something my grandmother would wear around the house
Just waiting for Eugene to drop his non-binary clothing line ;) I also find it extremely difficult to find dresses that fit well as someone without chesticles.
I liked the cottage core and Eugene's.
Why did i burst out laughing at three in the morning imagining keith making a daddy's favourite dress 😂😂
Eugenes is the best tbh good job Eugene!👏👏
I thought this before and Ill say it now, Neds dress was so fucking ugly , it wasnt flattering, too much happening, but not enough at the same time, it really isnt that creative, like its giving goodwill hottopic from 2000
I think Zachs energy was so adorable in the dress
Eugene's dress reminds me of the evil step mother of snow White or the witch from Rapunzel but I really like the dress and the color too also the shawl beautiful
The way Eugene struts in with the heels and wig was everything!
THE LIKES AMOUNT WA 1:sparkles: 69 :sparkles: .
Cute
Hot
Zach seems like a such a good friend honestly
Zach's puns are NEXT LEVEL
Zachs dress is giving roald dahl illustrations
I love my algorithm giving me this video again because after all this time my heart still so deeply desires Eugene’s Anjelica Huston The Witches dress. Time to update my wardrobe!
0:48 I was rewatching this (I want to apologize in advance) and all I could think of was “You should’ve tapped into loving you wife”
A video without Keith?????+??!?!?!!?! NO.
My toxic trait is thinking I could do this without a single issue…
I love how Kelsey already had 2 drinks (that we can see on cam, might have even more off-cam) in the time-span of making the dress lol
Kelsey is a mood
Eugene looks so cute in the checkered long sleeve red shirt, white t shirt, and blue jeans. It looks really good on him 🥰

why the fuck did *** take out his phone when he was adding double digit numbers didn’t he go to yale????
i really loved zach's!!
I'm sorry but I want a part with only the three guys iykwim
Eugene’s was the clear winner, sometimes less really is more 💁🏾‍♀️
I really love Eugene’s dress! So stunning, clever and can present us with more than just one look. If he has more time to finish it, it can definitely go on for a fashion runway. 😭🙏💕
The fact that Eugene is talking like a model
Eugene amazes me every tiiiiime
I love Kelsey. Petition to make her a permanent Try Guy now that Ned's gone
I loved Eugene in his infancy.
what are all these people in the comments on?? ned’s is so… atrocious, i hate it so much 😭
Yale boy needed a calculator for basic math - addition. Can someone from Yale tell me what exactly is your admission criterion?💁🏻‍♀️
Well he did go through his rebellious teenager phase in his 30s by fucking up the one good thing he had.
why was zack so good at giving posing instructions
all drama aside: ned's dress is fucking ugly 💀

Zach killed that shitt... LMFAO!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eugene made a thneed
I know we hate him now but ned’s dress was really ROBBED here
Kelsey, I’m pretty sure you should still wear underwear with a dress. If your dress flies up in the wind people are going to get a full view of your butt and most people don’t want everyone seeing their butt. If you don’t mind that then continue not wearing underwear. I would go as far to say you should also wear shorts because most people don’t want strangers seeing their underwear incase of wind and also it stops thighs from rubbing together. Also, I feel like underwear is quite important to just stop any leakage of any kind. I don’t know about other girls but it’s not unheard of me to pee a little when I sneeze and I also get plenty of discharge everyday that I do not want covering my legs.
Ned was not robbed
Ya know, I first started watching the Try Guys cuz I thought Eugene was sexy af (lol) and when I found out he was for the men of the world (again lol) it was the alcohol states video with Kelsi and I just loved him even more (lols all around)
It's funny that the comments on so many Try Guys videos now are like "F*CK Ned; he's a LOSER and I'm GLAD he didn't win," but nobody's said that on this video bc we all know he was robbed 💀 Ned is trash, but that dress deserved better lol
me being pleased that I figured out basic math quicker than yale boy
zach standing there in his mimi is so wholesome and adorable im losing my mind
The Kelsey Zach friendship is one of my favorites.
Kelsey gluing the dress to herself was hilarious 🤣
Kelsey SHOULDVE DONE A SUN DRESS a dress inspired by the sun that is the sun that would've been keith like LMAO
I love that any time it's a fashion thing Eugene wins 🏆
I want to be inside ned’s rear pumping like a Thera gun on level 3.
Zach struggling with his chronic pain that I cannot spell is so sad
Guys, when you're making clothes, if you have one of those fabric models just take the fabric and start pinning it straight on and folding to get the look you want. You can get so far with your design just by doing that and once you have everything pinned and folded on the model to your liking take it off with all the pins in it and just start sewing. You'll get so much farther so much faster.
guy who loves nirvana cheats on his wife: good headline for Kurt Cobain to rise up from his grave, fuming
Kelsey smoked WHAT? HOW MANY TIMES?
“if zach wins-“  zach- bitch please
Making the Word fuck into a pattern is my dream
Nana in a house dress is SO on point for Zack here, I have for sure seen my grandmother in something like that.
Not a fan of Kelsey’s crudeness. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Energy wise: Zach Construction wise: Ned Sexy wise: Eugene Pattern wise: Kelsey That's my determination for each of them.
is Kelsey drunk
Meds dress low key slays, the writing on the “corset” is everything
guess Ned’s rebellious phase really caught up to him
Did she just say she smoked meth 👀
Ned's rebellious teenager phase is happening noiw, and it's MESSY.
Kelsey saying “not Ned” is such a mood
Eugene is right, Zach's look is 100% somebody's Lola's house dress
Now Ned has to make a new life without instructions 😊
id also wear Eugene's if it were black instead
... Id wear Neds dress ngl
When Keith isn't in videos there's no one to come up with punchlines to Zach's jokes
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I LIKE Kelsey but ppl liking her dress (tho I do like the mixed fabric) was a CLASSIC case of ‘thin hot girl has fabric on’.   Again, I cannot stress, I really like Kelsey.
Still pissed about Ned
I feel like the only reason Ned didn’t win is bc of how it fit his body
Don't have Kelsey back, she is just god awful
Eugene and Ned both crushed it! So good!
I love Kelsey
Ned should of won, both where good but he put so much more in
Why do they never choose Ned even when he is the OBVIOUS winner 😡
Guess I was the only one who thought Kelsey was annoying as hell. Even a lot of the guys seemed irritated by her
10:58 yes sewing hurts my back so much, i honestly had a shoulder muscle seize up a week ago and spent 4 days to recover TT
Rain! On! MEME!
eugene only won because it was eugene sure he did well with not having any rough edges and stuff but if zach or keith had made this they would have been in last place for sure
I love how Ned and Zack always says they are not good with feminine things but they always impress me. Go kings😭
Ned won hands down
NED WAS ROBBED
This is my favorite series ever omg
K & K (kelsey and keith)
LOVE KELSY
Ned was robbed!!
JUSTICE FOR NED
"If Zach wins then Patriarchy wins" Lmfao I can't
I like chelse's dress. I loved it
I forgot how much I adored Kelsey until I watched the video xD
The ambitions of the men. + one women.
personally for me it's 1. Kelsey 2. Ned 3. Eugene 4. Zach. but taking into account their exposure to dresses it would be Ned 1 and Kelsey 2
NED WAS ROBBED. PERIOD.
zach was really every grandma
zach is such a great instagram boyfriend
Oh Zach you cracked me up with sewing your arm holes up bless you ♥️ Eugene I loved yours but Ned was robbed
At 2:55 I down right said "Omg that's so fetch." as a joke then right after I hear this lol
I'm just sad that I didn't get to see Kelsey try on Eugene's dress
eugene’s just looked like a blanket draped over them with a zipper.
lol my name is mimi cheers zack
I love Ned's dress but I would buy Eugene's 😍
Ned’s dress is so fucking cool! The pattern, the corset, it’s all gorgeous! It’s just so killer
i would 100% wear ned's dress, and im punk
Ned should have won for sure
I’m obsessed with Kelsey
Ned was my fav! Eugene second
in my eyes, Ned is the winner!!!
Naaahh this is dumb. Ned 100% Won this episode. His dress was the nicest and the most detail for the that time. It was incredible. Eugenes was so average imo 😂🤦‍♀️
Lol kelsey is hilarious! She does an instragram shoot, goes hard for a bit and instead of getting super stressed out she says "f*#@ it" it's good enough and chills while messing with the competition. You love to see a confident, sorry not sorry, fun  boss b*tch!
Kelsey fits in so well with the try guys like her and ned fighting over who has a bigger butt and Zach helping for pose for pics lmaoo
random thing : i made my first quilt when I was four and it was pink and blue squares
Eugene's looked great, but Ned really should have gotten it, if for nothing else than the sheer attention to detail. Sure the hemming wasn't great in parts, but the ribbing, the handwritten grafiti print, the corset back, the metal embellishments, layering the sheer fabric over the main fabric for the skirt, just everything.
I love the energy Ned is giving me. Rewatching these is my fav 💕😭
Ned dress looks so cool not just cause it my style but like his had so much effort in it and out his comfort zone  I love it
I loved Ned’s and Eugene’s! Beautiful!
I love Kelsey!!!!
Eugene’s dress was good but Ned’s was freaking great. He was totally robbed! He’s execution was way better. I think the internet agrees that Ned was the real winner.
Ned was ROBBED!!!
I Absolutely LOVE how Ned's dress was made, how it looked, just everything about it was absolutely amazing, especially from someone who has no experience.
NED WAS ROBBED. IM SORRY BUT EUGENE LOOKS LIKE MY 6 YEAR OLD SELF COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER ITS JUST NOT IT
SHOES. You guys haven't tried to make any attire in awhile... So how about taking a local basic shoe making class and attempt to make a basic pair with each of your unique styles.
I'd ABSOLUTELY wear Ned's.
say it with me: ned. should’ve. won.
Kelsey tries really really hard to be funny..
A former gal pal attended Laurelton Hall, Catholic Girls Prep School in Milford, Connecticut years ago. When learning sewing in home economics class, one of her classmates refused to learn to use a needle and thread, choosing to staple everything. The afternoon before graduation, the nun handed her a staple remover, insisting she take out every one, then re-hem all her skirts and blouses with a needle and thread, or she would be refused a diploma. She regrettably complied. Years later, she was getting married to a rather well-off guy in Florida. As she was marching down the aisle, some bugle beads fell off her gown. Several former classmates in attendance remarked: "Does anybody here have a Swingline Tot handy...?" 😀😍🤩☺
Kelsey is so awesome, i love that girl!
They all did a fantastic job, but I especially like Ned's dress! Great job, Ned!
I think Ned would have won. It was so challenging and the boning and the layers. And Eugene went kind of simple when it came to construction
Kelsey is absolutely so attractive
12:27 Kelsey just not giving a fuck with no top on, measuring herself, iconic
16:48 thank you.
I love Kelsey. She is so honest and cute
Try guys make suits👀
OOOOSH! 🥵🙌🏾 not only did Eugene seeeerve but his dress is fun, sexy & timeless, the color & material PERFECT. I love versatile designs  that can be dressed up or DOWN, it's  guaranteed to turn heads & suitable for any occasion! Bravo!! 🙌🏾🥇👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
With an overcoat and head scarf in two totally different fabrics from the dress, and uglier shoes, Zach would have been total Prada. You KNEW Eugene would bring it. If you didn't know, you would have believed this was something fresh from the runway. The hood is very Grace Jones. Ned's really nailed it. The construction was impressive. Really liked Kelsey's. With a little better construction it looks like something you could buy.
ned? ROBBED
The title of these series should be changed to who can come in second place to Eugene.
zack's is better than kelsey's
Mari is woman's,or girl's name at here in Finland too.
am i the only one who dislikes Ned's the most
"dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing" and that's where vogue/harry styles got their inspo from
So proud of all of them. I always am. I think they’re amazing.
The fact that they started glueing the dresses together after a certain point made it really authentic to desperate sewing with a timeline 😂
Ned sitting in his corset dress is so stiff and relatable 😂
also can we see the guys try roller skating... i cant be the only one who wants to see that
my cuban grandma has like 10 dresses that look just like zach's dress
Female keith really be killin it
12:28 well someone had to say it
Eugene is so supportive in this video!
For Ned to step up his creativity only to lose is a shame.
Once more, so much fun to be had here. And all of them rocked their dresses, I do love it! Just wanted to put that out there.  Ned hammering his dress was so much fun, it was great.  Also Zach sewing his arm holes shut was sooo funny.  Also, as someone who doesn't like dresses, I am into Neds! And he has so much fun with it, it captures exactly what he wanted it to do.  Eugenes presentation was also out of this world though, I am sooo into it. Not too big of a fan of the dress, besides the fact that I love the fact that it was a hood. I love my hoods AND capes. I am not into the big cutout on the back, but it's a style choice. It's also a bit plain, I'm not a fan of that usually.  I'd totally switch Ned and Eugene here, and I'm usually totally biased towards Eugene I'll admit that xD
Eugene is giving us golden age of Hollywood!!
My least favorite guest lol damn
I've only made a skirt with a guide...but i swear i'd be making a full formal gown. All the pretty fabrics!!! But mad respect for dude making a corset.
Zachs “yeah girl” and helping with poses when Kelsey asked for insta pics is just too pure
Wait was Eugene wearing his flannel inside out? or was that just me?  It looks good tho so-
I don't care what they say... Ned wooooon
Ned was ROBBED
She does a damn good impression of Keith!
I’m so high… and now I’m dying.. 14:10 and they’re just getting started
to me it was 4. Kels, 3 Zac, 2 Eugene, 1 Ned
Come'on... I'm not saying Eugene's dress wasn't cool, & I'll even say it looked better on E then Ned's did on him. But comparing the work involved: E's was kinda baggy on the body & I think the only reason it was chosen was bc of the different possibilities that the hood/shawl allowed. It's certainly creative, but it's MADE to be WORN creatively more than it is MADE creatively, you know? N's though, the top half was really impressive for an amateur designer, and the entire thing HAD DESIGNS (checkers, chains, graffiti, rhinestones). Though I concede that quality-wise, E's appears better. Idk
Ned's 1st Place in my heart
I miss this Kelsey
Kelsey's dress looks soooo pretty! I love it!
I love people are shitting on eugenes craftsmanship just because he won 😂
ned looked so sad after all his thought and work when they were complimenting eugenes dress lol. i adored eugenes dress but this always happens, the surprise factor of his always helps him win every comp even when others have just as much ingenuity!
Neds dress had so much more in all categories, layers, colours, fabrics, boning, decoration. A lace up bodice. The most complete and finished article that would actually look good for various occasions. Eugenes dress had little shape, a single colour, single fabric was also lopsided in the main body and the "hood". The hood had no finished edges. The gloves wig and heels were not part of the challenge. Had each of the others also had all those accessories it would have raised them all up a notch. I really think Ned was the winner baby.
JUSTICE FOR NED!!! He was the clear winner my dudes
Kelsey is literally EVERYTHING. Love her personality ❤️
Ned actually looks amazing in his dress 😶👌🏻
ned is just great at everything huh
Guys I LOVED Neds dress and creativity BUT Eugene JUST FUCKING KILLED IT!! The shapes OMG with only a color he created texture and a beautiful, chic and sexy look!!! I want that dress right now!!
We just gunna blow past Kelsi doing meth?? Or did I mishear???
This was a lot of fun! To make it fair though, I think they should have had some other person who wasn't in the competition model all of their dresses and designed them for that person so that their body types and modelling abilities wouldn't be a factor
I would honestly love to have Ned and Eugene’s dresses they’re so good! 😊💜
Lmao Kelsey was the perfect addition to this video. she was so funny and I loved her concept.
When Ned turned around. Hot damn those muscles
Eugene is Still SO GEORGOUS!
any fashionistas out there who can tell me what the dress is at 3:24 ? it looks pretttyyyy....
The Try Guys are role models. Kelsy talks about what she said the first time she smoked meth. Cool.
Zach: "Dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing." Kpop stans and TikTokers: WE'RE TRYING, ZACH! We're DOiNg OUr BEsT!!!
Pleat was today’s wordle word
I really think that Ned should of won.  I did like Eugene's but it really looked like it was thrown together last minute and wasn't really complex
When I look at Zach’s dress, I can’t not think about a hospital gown.
Grandma dress.
They did it for the girls and the gays.
ned was robbed
The try guys should try GYMNASTICS
I don't think Eugene knows what the new look is
Gota love that punk rock gingham
The fact that the costume expert is an amazing Steven universe cosplayer makes me so happy
I came to the comments pleased--I'm glad we all know that Ned should've won
Sewing was my skill I got out of the pandemic and coming back to watch this again afterwards it’s awesome lol
Don’t get me wrong, I LOVED Eugene’s dress but I think it was a little plain. I feel like it could have used some more pizzaz. Ned incorporated different fabrics, which I think made it more interesting. I just felt like Eugene’s was just a little bit boring, don’t get the wrong idea tho, I absolutely loved the fabric and the hood and shape of the dress. I think they all did amazingly considering the fact that they only had 3 hours + no experience with making clothes from scratch. I crochet clothes, but I don’t think I’d be able to create a dress from fabric.
They did Zach dirty too tbh - besides making a dress in 3 hours being amazing, he worked hard, worked well, made impressively good, sane and pretty design decisions, and problem-solved on his feet. The only thing was that the shape and details looked awkward - which, yeah, it was his first time lmao.  And his use of hot glue was judged even though Kelsey's wasn't and even though it's the same thing as double sided tape - which is glue.
am i crazy or is that jennifer lawrence
I miss Keith
Why does Ned legitimately look good in that dress?
I LOVE KELSEY I WANT MORE OF HER!!!!
10:20 lol ned in the back 😐
Okay but Zach is for sure the one I would want taking pictures for my Instagram 🤣🤣🤣
Ned should've won. He was so ROBBED.
Can this he reprised but make dresses for wives?
Did she say she smoked meth???!?
Kelsey was very cringe to watch so forced and offensive honestly 😬. Everyone is was awkwardly looking at each other trying to smile 😒
The dress Ned made was incredible. It has an awesome vibe and took so much work. Eugene's is gorgeous too.
I absolutely love Eugene's shirt with the mountains on!
Kelsie took kieths place and made a dress out of blue squares
I fucking love Kelsey
Ned looks good w a mustache 🌱
my brother said there was a gay try guy. at first, i thought the gay one was zach, and i told my brother i ship kelsey and eugene.
They could have done this challenge with instructions ngl... Textiles is hard
The way Ned makes me feel around 22:45... 🤤 He's showing off that bod!
Someone make Ned's dress! I would wear that every day
I knew it, of course! Eugene would knock it out of the park again He's so talented
“I’m using the crack on the floor as my guide” Kelsey always know what to say lmao
I’d kinda prefer if they did stuff *with* instructions……
Imma need Romans top
Keith mimicry was awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We’re just gonna ignore the fact that Eugene wore huge heels and walked flawlessly in them??!
Don't worry Zach. I too have sewed sleeves shut.
"Dudes in dresses" Zach welcome to 2021 going into 2022
Nice sweatshop...without instructions. Do make sure the fire exits are not blocked so as not to recreate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. That would not make a good YouTube video.
15:15 why is Ned pantless? Lol
Kelsey's dress was cute! I would totally wear it
"Kpop stand, dudes in dresses" -Zach  He can read the future!!!
I know a lot of people say Ned should've won, but idk if I agree. Sure you can blame it on his body type, though I don't think that's the actual factor in this. To me at least, I prefer Eugene's because that's more my style, I really liked the cloak/cape thing with the hood, it really gave the dress a wow factor. While Ned used a lot of time to make the corset, like punching eyelets, etc (which is hard, I hit in 128 eyelets by hand, it's really not easy and can be very time consuming), in the long run, Eugene's was more reliable, I suppose you could say. At least that is how I look at it. Using tape won't hold long in comparison to a good seam. The hem would also probably tear quickly as he hadn't done anything with it. While it's a part of the look, it'll be easier to tear. For that part it could've been a good idea to use glue or something similar as in that way the loose threads would stay where they were without ripping everything else with it.  It's not always the clothing with the most effort wins because it can end up looking unfinished and Ned's dress kind of looked like that to me. But I was for certain it'd either come in 1st or 2nd, same with Eugene while I knew the two others would come last.  But all four of em did great as they had little time and whatnot to do this. I've sewn and designed clothes for a few years and even I would've struggled making something in just a few hours from scratch.
Zach: Kpop stans, dude in dresses make it happened TXT Yeonjun: did somebody call me?
Honestly Ned, with that 70s porno stache is hot
Eugene, start your fashion design line!!
Cape dress?! I want one!!! <3
Neds shoulders are so masc 😳
Oh my goodness*
Oh my goodness*
Oh my goodness*
Oh my goodness*
Oh my goodness*
No to the nike**
Oh my goodness*
Oh my goodness*
Conceptually, I love Kelsey’s dress the most. The execution wasn’t all there, but I would absolutely where a polished version of that, it was actually amazing
You can see the director in Zack when he was coaching the Instagram photoshoot and she looked fierce
Ned was robbed
Me:*watches video * huh this should be interesting  Also me:*screams in fashion design major*
Are you freaking kidding me, Ned made goddamn corset! Without instruction! How did he loose
Eugene looks so good in those heels and the elegant pose while he waited for results. Yum!
I now want to see more dresses made with hammers. Do they even exist?🤔
Idk man I thinks zacks dress looks great especially on him it just fits lmao despite the construction errors
on god, took me a year to realize this was uploaded on my b-day XD
Zack hobbling away in a moomoo after Kelsey says that she won’t help him take off the moomoo made me laugh so much
In the episode where they were drunk Ned could solve difficult math problems easily and here he goes and takes his phone for a simple addition 😂😂 love you all
why is there no comment on the fact that Kelsey said she smoked CRACK...
I love Eugene and what he was trying to do. With a few modifications, his mother would look smashing in his dress. But Ned's dress was ART. It can and should be re-created by a professional. I'm estimating the model to be a women's size 16, with a 38-inch waist and a 40-inch hip; that would be about a 42-inch bust. A rectangle-shaped woman would be fire in this dress, and apple shapes can get away with it.
“The best part of wearing a dress is you don’t have to wear a bra”  Speak for urself girl, some of us actually have tiddies and need that extra support..
Everyone needs a friend like Zach to take pictures of them lolol
Am I mistaken or did Eugene make or have made a more fleshed out version of his dress?  I swear I saw it somewhere at some point, but I may be having weird false memories.
i want a sweat jumpsuit like kelseys
Kelsey not helping Zach is the most support he needed
22:05 creepy ghost people in the background😳
not really related tgo this video but why can't we normalize woman and men wearing skirts and dress ,cause when a woman wears it she isn't respected and men try and tuch them and when men wear them the get told they are for woman
When Eugene mentioned the house dress my mind immediately screamed "DASTER!" which is Indonesian for house dress and is exactly what Zach is wearing. Indonesians back me up.
its a bit uncomfy to know that my waist measurement is the same around as neds hips
So funny how she thinks she has a butt, however she flatter than a pancake 😂
I need someone to make a compilation of time The Try Guys were robbed of a win.  Zach - Bagel Episode Keith - literally any episode where he loses his mind in without a recipe Eugene - TBD Ned - The DRESS. HE DID SOOOOO GOOD
My name is Kelsey, and as someone who has heard my name spoken on camera like, twice ever, this video is really fucking with me 😶
OMGGGG Eugene  mentioned the housecoat! XD XD
I would love to see the next trend be dudes in dresses and skirts
9:01 i need a zack where can i get one
Watching Zack model his meemee fills my heart with joy, I have watched this one at least 5 times because it makes me smile so much. I would love to see more sewing challenges 🖤
rewatching this and i’m still made ned didn’t win his was nearly perfect and had way more work with the corset smh
This was, regardless of their lack of skill, still less chaotic than any episode of Project Runway EVER!
i know everyone is talking about how creative ned was but eugene's dress was classic and timeless, which is what he was going for. keeping it one fabric/colour actually worked for me because it kept it looking elegant instead of tacky. eugene did deserve his win imo.
13:10 so we gonna do it or has it happened already-
Eugene straight up cosplaying Mariah from Jojo Part 3 god damn.
3:41 well maybe you don’t, sis, but👀…
Ned won in my opinion, and Kelsey is second for me. Eugene's fine, but I'm not a fan of formal dresses. And Zack's is good in theory. In theory.
Did you just have a stroke? 😂 😂
ned you won in our hearts
JUSTICE 4 NED !!!!
I really feel bad for Eugene this year at the met Galla he was so excited to wear that dress on his Instagram and had to go with a suit instead. It looked amazing but he seemed so disappointed about the dress
loool NED WAS NOT ROBBED !!! IDK what yall talking bout but i def wasnt feeling it
I don’t know if it’s been said but Eugene A T E
Love how Ned is sitting at 25:40
Wow, Ned really got cheated out of a win.
Eugene's was really awesome, but it was something you could find in a catalogue honestly. Ned's and Kelsey's looked really unique, like something you would see as a concept image.
It was a fun episode
The way Zac's voice got reeeeeaaaaalllly really high when he was asked if he ever made a dress before makes me think he has made dresses before lol
kelsey saying you don’t need to wear a bra and underwear in a dress but that’s imo the only time both are mandatory lol. protect ur coochie girl!
ned always get screwed!! when his is the best he never wings cuz he’s not “creative” enough and now he finally did an amazing job while also being creative and still loses?? what!??
I'm only watching this because i want to see how to sew because I just got a machine.
“im using the crack in the floor for reference, thats.. thatd what i said the first time i did meth-“
I couldn't focus on any dress cause I was enamoured by Roman's black corset top moment <3_<3
This guest actually proves that girls can be funny
Did…did Ned not win?  I swear I’ve watched this before and NED WON!  What freaking Mandela nonsense is happening right now?
I feel like Zach’s dress is something my mom would wear at the beach 😂
So glad I'm not alone in thinking Ned got robbed here.
"Kelsie, say something Keith like!!" Kelsie: *mocks Keith's laugh*
The way both Ned and Eugene's dress is so pretty. But as a person who had no experience in sewing, AND STILL made a corset for myself (crying and struggling longer than Ned did) with youtube's help, seeing Ned's corset made my jaw drop.  He did it. Its pretty.
I want Kelseys outfit
Zach are you wearing batikkk?
legitimately so proud of ned
The mundane flat descriptively tie because drain directly scrape except a optimal deficit. aboard, terrific otter
I’m a trained pattern cutter and designer. I kept saying nooooo, just noooo, ah good grief. A for effort though.
I just wanna know how tf ned made a boned and laced corset in less than 3 hours like bruh. I’ve been seeing for years and I haven’t even attempted a boned corset yet cuz I’m not experienced enough
did Kelsey say she smoked meth😭
Waiting for Tim Gunn to say... make it work !!!
This Episode has some serious Project Runway vibes going on !!!
unpopular opinion, ned with the mustache looks scary
Why is it just them doing goblin sewing? Like cosplayers do?
Eugene and Ned both did spectacularly! Ned’s was creative, Eugene’s was flawless. Arguing in comments discounts the immaculate work both of them did- in the end I would’ve called a tie
Literally my favorite thing about maxi dresses is the lack of necessity for bra or panties, I’m so glad Kelsey brought that up
Kelsey and Zacks photo shoot moment is the essence of leo-leo friendships ❤️
I've been making dresses nonbinary by kinda dressing them down as much as possible. No necklace, basic earrings, masculine rings, mandals (usually birks), hairly legs and underarms satchel instead of a purse.(masculine tattoos poking out if you've got em) Dresses are comfy AF and you don't need to present as feminine to wear one. Even a floral one. They should be for everybody :)
I want Eugene's dress in my wardrobe 😍
As a someone who sews, and has made tutus before... this hurts me. it hurts me so much.
can y'all remake this video without Kelsey
10:43 ya like jazz
Love Kelsey's personality
I’m sorry when you first smoked meth? Did anyone else get that? Lmao 😂
I feel like Eugene's dress was a little to low on the creative side? It just seems like he cut fabric, sewed it together (barley) and said it was a dress. Ned put all of his effort and so much of his i guess brain cells and thought through every little thing he did. He put so much effort in what fabric he put and how he did the corset and boning. Ned should have won.
I lost it when Zach sewed the sleeves shut! Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣
Kelsey forgot her ADHD meds huh
you should try to make a wedding dress XD
11:45 I love men supporting men with masculine energy but without toxicity 🥰
I think a fun concept for them to do would be to do Halloween costumes  either with or without instructions because as someone who does sew,  patterns/instructions are not always helpful and typically with Halloween costumes it's more than one piece that has to be made
Bed dam OMG
Ned and Eugene has a plan B if this try guy thing doesn't turn out well
Thank you Eugene for not changing your voice. Seems like a lot of gay men feel the need to change their voices because they are gay.
Ned was ROBBED.
Zach says dudes in dresses as if we havent been trying for years now
I personally think Ned should have won… but Ned wins everything and Eugene takes everything so seriously.. it’s probably better off he won lol
She’s had A LOT done to her face since her buzzfeed days
Love how at the last few minutes of the construction phase Kelsey pretty much became Emma Stone Cruella to zack
Okay but Give Zack's dress a snazzy belt and I feel like it'd be a good look
dude, Ned had so much fun working on this. It got his math and engineering brains working
13:40 (this is just the time stamp for when I have a bad day and need a laugh)
when Eugene showed up in his dress I honestly thought for a moment he was a woman, that dress is stunning. I would genuinely buy one of those for my mom, I love the look.
Why is the boring dude always winning with his boring creations
Honestly zack dress just need a cut on the sleeves, and a cut in both sides to show the size of your legs, trow a belt of something else and its a fit😂 you can puit it in a store and sell ot for like a beach dress or something
Eugene's dress reminds me of Anjelica Huston's in The Witches and I love it
Zacks cat walk will forever live in my dreams.. and not in a good way 😂
I need to buy Eugene's dress. Please and thank you.
Grandma vibes
Me after Eugene points out Zach's dress: Yeah, Zach is wearing a daster. 😅
Personally I like Kelsey's dress out of all of them. Even if the back was a bit messy, it still looked far more finished and fitted than any of the others.
22:05 the one person that was included in the dodgy word "etnic" in the room raising their hands and saying "owkay...." lmao Eugene, what the fuck
omg i need more kelsey in without instructions 😂 shes so fucking funny i cant get enough
Lol these fools taking measurements If it fits, I stitch-s
Ned looks really Italian in this video
Me: Zach looks like my abuela. Eugene: It looks like a gown a nana would wear. Hell yeah!
Ned should've won. Eugene's is freaking beautiful. But He put a whole ass corset together. And it was done very very well.
I kinda feel like they should have taken each other's measurements or something instead of their own tbh.   Your measurements are best taken in by someone else instead of on your own because between the instinctual slouching to see, the positioning of your arms (more for bust measurements than anywhere else), and not being sure if the tape is properly straight, there's a lot of room for error.
The amount of estrogen in that room (and I'm not talking about the women) was overwhelming.  Only Ned stuck to his testosterone based roots.  That being said, I'm a straight guy, but I would go trans and wear the purple dress.
I love Eugene so much 😂😂😂
9:19 honestly he gives great direction. I want zach to be my friend. Now that I'm on T, I actually want pictures taken, but because of years of hating pics of me, I have no idea how to pose.
Absolutely gagged at Ned's knack
they always criticise ned for being too boring and then when he does a brilliant job and goes out of his comfort zone they still make Eugene win this video ned deserved to win they rly did him wrong
Ned ABSOLUTELY should have won are you kidding me?? Girl I would wear that in a heartbeat!
i hate neds dress….. but u know
Make men in dresses the new thing? It's been the new thing have u not seen men in strawberry dresses? 😭
Ned with a mustache🥵
Eugene goes in full tilt for the Norman Bates moment, lol.
Telling by the comments I've read we all think Ned should have won. But can we talk about the photoshoot and that flawless Keith impression?!?!? Best parts of the video.
You guys should do making a fursuit without instructions 😳
Kelsey.. sundress.. don't need a bra or panties?? Big chested women need a fkn bra.
I’m a seamstress, but I make plushies not clothing so, watching this was fun to watch
Eugene made Mommy’s favourite.
I love all of them especially Eugenes in terms of something I could wear but I want Ned to win soooo bad he worked so damn hard!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE Kelsey and her crude sense of humor, she's awesome. She was also great on the Johnny Appleseed episode of Ruining History
Some of yall are taking this wayyy too far and personal its just a video ffs
Bed should have won, he put in so much effort, and worked so hard I even think Ned thought he was gonna win
NED NAILED THIS
Honestly if anyone sewed pockets on the dress it would've been a winner in my book
Without a Dressipe
i love eugene, but he won bc hes a good model.
No one: Roman: the boning is so hard
Avril Lavigne would love Ned's Skater boi Dress.
I can't even look at Ned's 70's pornstache without laughing.
Ned is the winner for me, point blank. It's actually annoying that Eugene's mediocre dress won just for the aesthetic of it. A fashion designing learner here, the draping of Eugene's dress wasn't that good to begin with and it shows in the neckline, the dress isn't symmetric at all, and the cape thing just hides more mistakes. On the other hand, Ned created a pattern on his fabric, constructed a CORSET for God's sake with boning, the dress was pretty symmetric, the layering on the skirt was super cool and the belt thing was a clever idea.  I don't agree at all with the decision made here.
This is everyone sewing ever. Even us who sew for a living. Its just i know what im doing but also why the fuck did i do that ?!
I feel like Ned's creation would sell in Harajuku.  (I have this h.Naoto shirt from over a decade ago, with the words "Fucking shithead" printed on the back in exactly that kind of grunge-y lettering, sitting useless in my closet... because, though otherwise gorgeously patterned and textured, there aren't a lot of occasions the wording feels suited for...).
kelsey's accidental "easy access" made me LAUGH
Sorry Ned and Kelsey, I have you two beat in the hip and ass department 😔
I'm a fashion designer in the making who is dying internally in the moment. Eugene knowing this much about fashion histoyis pleasing. I am a happy student on that aspect. I'll update to when I see the final look. Edit: now she tried to speak French...I've been studying French for 11 years so that killed me too. Edit: okay...I'm not mad at the final dresses. Eugene's dress with the Cape is amazing. I like Kelsey's  summer dress...but the pockets...oh no...moving on to Ned. I liked the angsty teen dress. I would have either kept it a skirt or tried a dress that doesn't look like a kids 1 piece...And ah...Zach...I don't know what to say....
Just like your career as a fashionista! Muahahaha 🦹‍♀️
Zach: make dudes in dresses a thing Harry styles: u got u
not me getting emotional over eugene being proud of ned when he showed his corset :,)))))
Zach should’ve just sown a large pillowcase and cut holes in it
Zach literally looked like a grandma. Ned's was the best, more variety, more complex and more creative. Idk how Ned didn't win that.
ned just running around in his underwear lol
Ned dress is amazing. I can make Eugene‘s dress easily but not Ned. What are these judges thinking 🤦‍♀️
Ned was robbed. Yes, Eugene did a great job, but it was pretty boring. Ned used several types of fabric, added accessories, made a corset WITH BONING, and even added an overlay for the skirt, it looked great and had a lot of attitude. Eugene just made a simple dress from one fabric and used the excess to make a shawl, while he did look good in it, it was so lack lustre compared to Ned. So in short, Ned was robbed.
just saying, tik tok heard Zach, dudes in dresses are really a thing after the whole Candace Owens and Harry Styles thing
I feel like if they did Criminal Minds with a completely different cast, Zach would make a fantastic Reid.
I feel like it would be cool to see them attempt the same pattern but without the instructions. So the same pattern pieces but no guidleines on cutting or construction.
I find dudes in dresses SO MF HOT man, like honestly it's incredible
OMG YAS NED MADE A CORSET I AM SO PROUD
Zach is such a photographer
“Dude in dresses make it the new hot thing”   …. We did it.
My school did a red dress project.   The assignment was to design a dress and make a life sized version.  So i got all excited made a plan for a REAL dress bought the fabric  Came in so hyped sat down took out my sewing supplies  Was in the zone working for 20 mins   I look up and everyone is cutting and painting red paint on paper...   Still went and made the whole thing and made my sister model in it  My teacher loved it and put in in the protective ribbon case in front of the school 🥰 Got prasie and good grade so it was worth it
No offense to anyone, but I agree with the final decision
I feel like Ned should have won
i wanna see a without instructions: cosplay edition
Ned did suck a good job but Eugene's is amazing. Love it
21:58 Wait, what ethnicity, exactly?
I have no idea wtf is going on, but I gotta subscribe.
I’m actually SOOO impressed by Zach
13:13 dare i say we’ve done it
Eugene is so cool! I like the dress he made. It looks simple yet elegant and sexy. I also like how he model the dress. I want to be like him. Great in everything.
when a fashion student watches this lol
Aww yous didn't call this episode "Without a Dresscipe". Opportunity missed 😔
Insanely wholesome Ned and Eugene moment over Ned's dress 😭
13:16 he fucking called it lol
Honestly thought Ned should’ve been first with Kelsey second
zach: its gonna rip!! kelsey: just like your career as a fashionista.. ahuahaha god how are all of them so quick and witty!! <3 <3 <3
Unpopular opinion, I think Eugene deserved this win, just because he put in a zipper.
zach has grown to be my favorite try guy. his quirky humor and dorky comments are the best. i love how he perceives things. colorful lil snowflake <3
Can't deny. 13 year old emo me would have worn Ned's dress while listening to MCR and updating my VampireFreaks page 😂
MORE VIDEOS WITH ROMAN
Any clothing is non-binary if you no longer give a shit 👍
I think they should have the cosplay girl remake the dresses
I want a dress with a built in hood. Like now
I kind of have a crush on zack
The white moustache compatibly trade because antarctica occasionally excite within a stimulating team. troubled, knowledgeable voyage
Zach dress was a dress that anyone regard of gender can use. I'm really impress.
25:41 Ned is all I will say😂😂😂😂😂 these guys will kill me with laughter one day
no shade to Kelsey but Zach's dress is better
She’s right, us females do love sundresses.
Who remembers gay horse from the plushie video?
The dress I like  for creativity the girl’s. The dress Ive had was Ned’s. The dress Im shopping for as an adult Eugene’s. The dress I’m wearing for a chill day Zach’s.
Why does ned look like freddie mercury
anyone gonna mention Eugene's heels?
Not me thinking this was gonna be making a dress without a recipe
Eugene's dress: simple,  classy elegant  Kelsey: cute fun, lunch with your friends and some instagram Zack: t shirt dress you bought on wish because it was 4$ but still kinda cute Ned: punk glam rock dress you see all the instagram baddies wearing
Kelsey is a unicorn hunter, she posted on Instagram that her and her partner were looking for a girlfriend
ned was ROBBED
Try Wives make a dress vs The Try Guys?
Just off the bat, before the video even really starts, Roman has such an amazing sense of style... gimme *grabby hands*
The jaded weight additonally mess up because bush daily thaw except a tough caravan. instinctive, childlike head
Eugene your drag mother won a sewing/design challenge on her season you won  sewing/ design challenge on the Try guys  the talent iz endless in  the hause of miller
Why is this judge guy so hateful towards hot glue like seriously get over yourself
No - real dudes do not wear dresses Zach... please
The tired congo presently choke because force biologically appreciate worth a superb forehead. cut, legal chronometer
“Dudes in dresses, make it the next big thing” oh Zach… you missed the skirt phase
Zach: dudes in dresses. Make it the next thing  Harry styles: say leessss👗💫💅
Ned deserved to win this video
kelsey as keith 💯
Also this is fucking BS!! No hate on Eugene but Ned def should have won.
honestly, was she drunk?
Eugene deserves to win yes Ned did amazing work but His was by far the best made it actually fit and flattered him which is the most important part along with it could actually be wearable. Also I just didn’t like Neds I think the concept was there but the finish project just didn’t look good to me but that’s my opinion if it was better tailored to his body it would probably change that opinion
The painstaking grease encouragingly recognise because plastic adversely chop except a disgusting castanet. unsuitable, voracious trigonometry
ned got robbed 😭
The dizzy voice physiologically entertain because doll concomitantly observe failing a lame protest. cagey, obnoxious brian
The new anatomy expectably perform because broccoli bacteriologically stir failing a domineering begonia. ablaze, resolute ketchup
24:42 Yeah, that's Chyanne Pepper
love the zach and kelsey photoshoot
If only you were still funny...
Eugene always wins! And as a Capricorn like himself, it's so satisfying❤️
Not gonna lie I really want the dress Ned make it’s definitely the style I love and while I do like the other dresses his definitely should have won
Impressive Gene !!!
I love all of them and I always try to be supportive and not like an annoyed client at a supermarket, but I just hated how much Kelsey kept pinching the others. I just don't like that kind of competition
Zacks dress actually looked extremely good on him. Men really should wear dresses more often. Maybe one day I'll have the confidence to wear dresses
Lol not a girl thinking she has a bigger butt than a guy simply cuz she’s a girl. It’s the entitlement for me 😫
Everyone had such good elements!  -Zach is so cute swaying in the stool in his lil house dress -NEDDD took no prisoners when it came to serving that look with CONFIDENCE -If it was constructed better in the back, I would defo buy Kelsey's dress  and Eugene reigns the supreme queen of serving a mf lewk overall 10/10!
my nana has the EXACT same fabric that zac had and made it into a dress like his lmao
This was fun to watch. You guys had me laughing a few times
Zach's looks like a duster.
The fast panty intringuingly command because heaven disappointingly suspect including a innocent father-in-law. rebel, billowy coin
I wanna know what is in Kelsey’s coffee 😂 lol
i love that ned being a rebellious teen means listening to nirvana
Eugene was giving me some F I E R C E Grace Jones energy and I don't know why.
Ok but like kelseys dress was really pretty 🤩
The heady verse arespectively collect because oboe mechanically decorate as a maddening bee. left, languid curve
I can’t believe eugene put in a zipper?! I’ve sewn several times and I’m terrified to put in zippers lmao.
Why do they call themselves the try guys when all they really want to do is try wearing women's stuff. Should just rename the channel "try queers"
No ones gonna talk about how they’re comfortable with taking their clothes off in front of each other?
i love zach like he's so pure
Guyyzz, Ned did *boning*. The fact that he did boning without any guidance (which is difficult to do with a lot of time and no cameras around) deserves 1st place, hands down.
I can't with the results I'm sorry I love Eugene's creation but Ned was hammering that dress what happened to measuring blood sweat and tears?! Ned deserved this win and I am saaaaad. Had to come comment after watching it on tv. Loved both Ned should have won by pocket change if you wanna see it that way.
I legitimately want the dress Eugene made so badly
i think ned shouldve won Eugene can make a paper bag look good and people would still vote for him but ned he literally made like corset BY HAND eugene taped an extra scrape of fabric and called it a cape
Wait they have HOW MUCH TIME? Oh sh*t  I took 2 months just to make a single beaded bodice.
Zack directing Kelsey to take bomb-ass photos so causally really made me laugh. they have such a sweet friendship
Eugene is giving me. Assassins creed
NEDS IDEA WAS SO NICE AND CREATIVEEEE
I love Eugenesdress
just need to point out that i think the a in ned's dress is actually inspired by emma stone's dress on the movie easy a (the placement is also very similar) and IM SO UP FOR IT
Girl I’m tryna bring capes back. I have several. I got one for a single penny at Value Village. Only those with pockets though!
Pockets are ALWAYS good! I need to learn how to ADD pockets to my stuff that doesn’t have them. I need a DIY for adding pockets to any dress.
Zach walked out and all I saw was madea 🤣
I seriously would buy Ned's dress I freaking love it!!!!
all craft episode secret weapon:glue
I'm sorry but I can't stop looking at Zach's right arm ITS GETTING STRANGLED
I love how everyone is fucking having a panic attack and Kelsey is using her phone
I like the details on Ned's dress but I think Zach's actually had a better silhouette. I don't know, I liked his dress other than the construction obviously
"Stuff me"  That's what he/she said.  Yes he/she. Don't discriminate
Love neds better  much more details
I would have put Zach above Kelsey. Zach's dress wasn't necessarily stylish but it was way more wearable than Kelsey's
Who else wants to see Zach in a maid's outfit  "Meeeeeeee"
Guys bring back candid competition
Guys bring back candid competition
Zack and Kelsey taking a photo break is gold👌🏻
4:55 making a dress is so much more straight forward then baking a muffin. U can see the seems and how a dress is made. Only thing u can see about the composition of a muffin is- it exists. And it’s slightly bread like??
i’m not rankings yet but apart from zach as last idk how they’re doing this i love the other 3 sm
please dont do "socially distanced" picnics. they are no safer than a "regular" picnic
Y’all are so rude to Eugene- ITS NOT HIS FAULT
I want a friend like Zach in my life
oh. I'm gay
Ned definitely won
Ned with his moustache is giving me Freddie Mercury vibes
Wait Zack has worn a dress before?????????
9:02 We all need a Zach
NOOO ZACH WAS BETTER THAN KELSEY
did they just make dresses in their respective colours (including Kelsey in blue)
Ned is definitely my winner for this one, he killed it.
Will go to my grave saying need was robbed this episode lol
Zachs cat walk killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Kelsey and Zach photo moment  😂😂😂
Kelsey is fricken annoying. She seems like she's trying too hard to be funny.
Oh mah gawd. Eugene's deep v in the back ...........
“Dudes in dresses. Make it a thing.” Harry Styles has entered the chat..
this is one of the tamest episodes of Drag Race i’ve ever seen
Zach made a grandma dress Eugene made a mom dress Kelsey made a dress for a 20 year old And Ned made a dress for an edgy teen Together they make one messy family
Ned keeps talking about the moustache, which is fine whatever, but the bandana is what's throwing me off. Why isn't he talking about that?
How could someone like Eugene have low self-esteem??? He is an absolute god amongst men!!!
Jsjsjsjsjjs
11:54 this part between eugene and ned is so wholesome
Ned is exquisite🔥
Kelsey has such a lovely singing voice.
Zach’s dress looks exactly like Popeyes wife Olive took a tropical vacation.😂
this is honestly a travesty, eugene's is beautiful but Ned clearly won, he was robbed
Ned was robbed of this win
26:08 😍
I loved Kelsey! She's such a great addition to the group. Please invite her back again.
lmao kelsey roasting them is everything
this is the best try guys episode ever
We made Zack’s dream come true. Men in dresses is now a hot thing.
“Dudes in Dresses, make it happen” Harry Styles: “say no more”
make an ancient greek style dress, it's just two rectangles sewn together
Yeah no ned DEFINITELY got robbed..
Yes, kpop stans are watching 👀
Really appreciate the work Ned put into it, its really impressive how much he achieved with the time limit, but Eugenes dress is just better.
can we get a rematch for this episode? definitely think that people disagree about the winning order
petition for kelsey to become the fifth try guy
The  fresh sandra aesthetically charge because spy briefly sack till a instinctive existence. glamorous, stimulating punch
The sweet tom-tom specifically plug because aries booly colour about a vengeful soprano. cluttered, filthy thread
Ned's mustache makes me want to throw a razor at his face. GET RID OF IT
*KELSEY!!!*
I am so here for the aggressive man-spreading that Kelsey does 😂
it took me until the timestamp 8:36 to have this thought... pockets.. they could've added pockets to their design plan
This feels like an episode of drag race
Ladies, always wear underwear, even in your sundresses! Haha!
Zach is so adorable.
FYI 20:41, its a kurta (indian traditional dress)
Ned absolutely should’ve won
Zachs dress looks like my grandmothers nursing home dress
🤣🤣🤣 good watch!
At this rate, eugene could even build a spaceship
What is wrong that girl? Was she high? 😂🤣
kelsey tall has a big mouth and lactose intolerance
I want to be able to buy Kelsey's Dress 😔
The disagreeable objective startlingly search because dictionary roughly boil aboard a defeated salt. overt, elegant stick
"Did you just have a stroke?" "Yep!"
Kelsey is hilarious
I'm so proud of Ned for letting his inner teenage rocker girl out, owning it, and creating an amazing product with a lot of details. You can tell he cared a lot about this by the attention to detail. Awesome work my man!
i actually want to recreate Eugene's dress so bad
me: *sees on is cosplay business owner*  also me: you are now my favourite!!
Zack’s is Lily Pulitzer esc
Kesley seems kinda drunk
I like the concept and colour for Eugene's dress, but the execution looked really bad to me. It looked like a bunch of fabric piled on semi-randomly and hope for the best. Man is flaunting "wrapped in a blanket" look and the judges are LOVING IT. Zach looks like a grandma. Kelsi looks like a mess. Even if she hadn't used hot glue, the style just screams DIY 5minutes craft hot glue project. Ned rocked it!
Bold of the woman wearing a one-piece jumpsuit thing to keep going on about the importance of easy-pee in a dress :P
10:21 ned in the background 😂
Alt Tiktok is probably so proud of Ned
Ned's dress reminds me of Wonder Woman
The overwrought cod disappointedly reproduce because clock formerly punch between a vigorous mary. silky, adaptable humor
I'm sorry Eugene but let's be honest, Ned should've won.
ned looks like ned flanders (simpsons)  in a dress wtf
.... no one else think Kelsey was belligerently high?
28:02
12:56 I think the word you’re looking for is unisex, Eugene
Zachs dress was great.
most likely gonna get hate for this comment but it’s my opinion, you don’t have to like it. and everyone has different styles and preferences but i didn’t really like ned’s dress. yes the corset is very impressive and nice but the front wasn’t doing much for me. preferably liked eugene’s and kelsey’s because it more my style.
Did anyone else giggle when he said "like, boning is so hard..." 😂😂
Dang... I see Avril lavigne when Ned did the walk for the dress
In all seriousness, please keep the moustache, Ned. This a rare thing, you have been given a special gift, a face that's meant for a moustache. With this hair, it's giving me real old hollywood vibes. I beg you, lean in!
When Eugene says it’s hard to find a lot of non-binary clothing I relate on a molecular level
I want zachs dress
NED WAS ROBBED!!
Wow 👏👏👏
17:04 I took a screenshot. This is what chaos looks like.
Honestly, A belt and a couple of accessories on Eugene's dress would be AMAZING
Good on Ned and Eugene for being bad bitches
Ned was robbed
9:04 yhea girl HAHAHA I love Zach
Glue, tape, and staple.... tools I’ve never thought would make clothing work lol
i like Kelsey, good bits
Are we gonna talk about how at the end of Ned's clip he stuck out his tongue and did the sign language symbol for love instead of Rock on... 🤣🤣 Oh Ned
I’m gonna be honest I don’t like Kelsey in these videos. She seems like a nice person but I don’t think she fits with what I wanna see from the try guys.
Eugene: I cant sew  yes, that is why it looks like a thneed   ive always wanted one and he made my dreams come true.    Eugene please make me a thneed.
Zach looks like he's going on a cruise lolol
Ned should’ve won🤫
...did she say "the first time I smoked meth" ??
loved all the dresses in the video<3
I wanna make ned's dress with better construction now lol
I cannot stand Kelsey. If Zach's dress was styled a little different I would totally wear that and Eugene's dress too
Eugene’s look is Mad Madam Mim but make it fashion
Kelsey’s impersonation of Keith’s laugh 😂
Ned won, idc. I don’t give a fuck 😂
The tan thought notablely land because north korea exclusively flap beside a faded software. learned, clammy sharon
Interesting to see none of them had experiences in making basic garments considering in my country sewing is an actual lesson in elementary class.
They all killed it
How come Kelsey thinks it's funny to be legitimately rude? Definitely not vibing with the Guys that well.
Ned won
Not that funny. Change my mind
Ned thick af
Are e just going to skip over the fact that Kelsey said she smoked meth? 👀
The one blonde YouTube chick seems rude, the judge, never you Kelsey. Kelseys name is memorable because she’s awesome, the rude blonde girl, no.
omg, look I like your guys' videos, but you people have zero chemistry and your banter is so boring. Do you hang out outside of work? cuz it shows you don't. I hope this was constructive. it makes it so hard not to skip through videos
Iron Giant reference made me happy ahah
Why do I love Ned's dress.💀🥀
Of course Eugene won what more could you expect from a god🤦
Eugene is elite!!
where the others making halloween party dresses, eugene decided to make a haute couture. classic eugene.
I love Kelsey sooo much but I couldn’t watch when I saw she was replacing Keith, always add the cherry on top, never remove the frosting then add the 🍒 😞 🧁
Can we have Kelsey on the show more often lol “that’s what I said the first time I did meth! I’m sorry...” lmao
The false familiar famous panda pharmacologically drag because sleep immunochemically entertain pro a available capricorn. hallowed, sudden baker
Zack: make dudes in dresses the next hot thing Harry Styles: hold my beer
No joke... if Eugene seriously took to sewing and dress making he would make a BADDDD ASSSSSS fashion designer! (His dress and his pants were fire! 🔥🔥🔥🔥)
Hey zach, moo moo is mamamoo's fandom lol
Lol did she really just say on the video that shes smoked meth
Ned took one look at this challenge, imagined it as an engineering project, and broke out the hammer.
I need Kelsey's sweat one piece
God bless! Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ Is our Lord and Savior and the Son of God Who died on a cross for our sins so we can live again in heaven where there is no pain or suffering!  Confess that God is the Father and Creator and raised His Son Jesus from the dead after Hs sent Him die for us! Confess and repent of your sins! Listen to the Holy Spirit and trust God! 🥰💝
So now I would really love it if an actual dress maker could properly make Ned's and Eugene's looks. Both rocked!
Without a Recipe: Muffins???
I love Kelsey
I know I'm late to the party (catching up on the Try Guys) but NED WAS ROBBED. His dress you could find somewhere. Eugene needed more shape and accents and touch ups. They barely complained about Ned's. Edit: Eugene only won because they loved his confidence in the hood.  NED MADE A CORSET....WITH BONING BY HAND....IN 3 HOURS! Don't get me wrong i liked Eugene's too but Ned should've won.
eugene: you cant find a lot of nonbinary dresses Eugene, Darling, every clothing is non binary if you dont give a crap ;)
Ned should have won!!
I want Eugenes dress
I want Eugene's dress!!! I need it! I would've spent my whole salary on that! 😆 It's amazing
I want Eugene's dress! Love the design!
The chunky august demographically rule because train normally store astride a quick chronometer. symptomatic, bad cellar
i feel like in the only one who thinks eugene should have won 😭
kelsey should have made an oatmeal raisin dress
It's official, Zach is my fave.
If he'd belt thing was a little higher and it had a slit I could be better
is Eugene’s shirt inside out
I'm so in love with Eugene 😍😍😍
You don’t have to wear a bra with a dress?? Women with large breasts have never done this!
Kelsey is every girl ever when they’re drunk but she’s just sober 😂.
For me— Kelsey 1st Ned/Eugene a tie 2nd ..and I’d still wear your dress tho, Zach!
Ned deserved this one... It's so unfair.
I want the finished version of Eugene's dress... It's so freakin good
God I love Kelsey. She is a whole mood
Kelsey is sooooo funny hahahahahahaha love her!!!
"My back hurts and I'm sweating a lot." Says everyone working in cheap labor sweat shops. Not saying this to throw shade or make people feel bad (which you should) it's just one of those moments when you come off a video about how most clothing is made. Really sad but also preventable.
I love Eugene's shirt so much in this video
Yes, Ned did put a corset thing and worked a lot, but I still think Eugene deserved that win
The panoramic bank intringuingly work because graphic implicitly hurry over a spicy bar. exciting exclusive, abounding area
I'm sorry, Ned won
Zach looking like Sophia Petrillo.
Ned should have wooooooooooon
As someone who has been sewing for years, very impressive. Coming up with and executing a dress in 3 hrs when you have no clue what your doing is crazy.
I love Eugenes dress. I would buy it
*i am a kpop stan(skz txt bts shinee seventeen exo and got 7)* zack: kpop stans make guys in dresses the next hot thing kpop stans three days later:making dudes wear dresses *one week after*: every dude is in a dress bc its hot now
Try guys try embroidery ? Maybe mmhm idk just an idea :)
1. I love Ned with a moustache 2. Kelsey was the MVP in the "50 States 50 Drinks" episode (back when the four were still buzzfeeding). So messy, but also so entertaining: a perfect temporary Keith substitute!
Watching Ned confidently strut in his dress despite being a "sporty, dad" is my favorite. Such a good message and smashing toxic masculinity
We love Zach predicting the future 😂
I WANNA SEE KELSEY PUT ON EUGENE'S DRESS.
Where's Keith? Making toothpaste commercials
Eugene was serving a whole FEAST with his walk-in plz 😭🔥🔥
Ned was stolen from, that is allll I have to say
tbh ned should've  won he made a corset!
Lol poor girl Ain't got no ASS! LOL ITS OK SHE PRETTY AND SHE HAS A BAD ASS PERSONALITY
Ned walked in lookin like he was ready to H O I S T
When Ned walked out he looked so intimidating, he looked like he could beat me up so easily and I am HERE FOR IT
Dude I'm kinda pissed. Ned added accessory to his, different textures, colors, boning, designs. Eugene only used one color and 1 fabric and only thought about the hood because it was just left over fabric. Ned's had so much more creativity and a theme. What were they thinking?
smn speaks math ; me : "i think he's just saying shit at this point"
are we all just gonna ignore Kelseys meth joke? 😂
My sister made me a dress when she was seven. Out of a white sheet with blue piping, set in sleeves and gathered skirt. No pattern and a seven year old using a sewing machine. I wore it for one day and ripped the crap out of it.
Idk why but Ned is really good at making dresses 😂 atleast for his first time
did i hear that right zach?! did i hear kpop stans
legit project runway episode?
Kelsey and Zach helping each other with a photoshoot mid competition is highkey the friendship I want in life
Everybody saying Ned was best but Eugenes was AMAZING ok.  I love like 50's and 60's dresses and that dress gave me vintage brought sexy modern and I WANT ONE.  I might have to make my own idk.   Ned did great of course but Eugenes was just so elegant and gorgeous and inspired I loved it.
The image of Zack guiding Kelsey through taking a picture will always have place in my heart
I was so into neds dress!
NED. SHOULD. HAVE. WON.  just saying.
Remember God loves you! Want to turn your life around, say this prayer to give your life to him⬇️ Dear eternal and everlasting father, i come before your throne of grace surredering all, i come before you asking for your grace, your mercy and your forgiveness. I know that i have not been living for you lately but i come ro you today ready to change my life and live for you and you only. Please guide along this journey with you in Jesus' name i pray, amen.
I love Ned's mustache a lot more than I was expecting to 😂
Zach asked us to make boys in dresses the next best thing and now we have the maid costume trend,,, we r almost there king
Did she say the first time she smoked meth?! 😂😂
the first time i think eugene wining is so unfair to nEDS FUCKING DRESS LIKE CMON LOOK AT NEDS EMO FUCKING DRESS
Omg this was hilarious! Have you guys ever considered doing a collaboration with the Historic Costuming side of YouTube? It would be really cool to see y'all chatting with an expert on dress history. Abby Cox has put out a lot of content on 18th Century clothing.
Seriously, Neds back in that corset though 🔥
Am I the only one interested in where Kelsey got her romper???
“In a dress, you can go without a bra”  Girl, I have a G-to-H- cup. If I went without a bra for a whole day, my boobs would literary bruise.  Friggin- b-cup- privilege.
Ned should’ve won. Hands down.
Zach saying he was just gonna make a t-shirt and then make it long — my immediate response: yeah that’s how they make dresses for fat people
Kellsy Savage
In all honesty, Eugene's dress did slap.
Damn Kelsy, I LOVED her dress
aw Ned should have won it!
I dont get ppl In the comments saying Eugene shouldn't have won and Ned should have and Eugene didn't put in enough effort, but how many dresses have you made?? What 90% of you answered 0, then dont criticize if you yourself haven't made a dress
I keep forgetting that Eugene is gay and so I just love how he is and question how someone can be so amazing then I remember he is gay and I just love him more
I love the episode but I don’t like Kelsey 😕 she’ a little rude
WE LITERALLY MADE MEN IN DRESSES A TREND HOLY FUCK
"Say something Keith-like" Kelsey: **MANIACAL LAUGH**
Zach is totally giving me Mama Mia vibes
26:09 where'd you get all that cake eugene
If Kelsey doesn't come back I'm fighting someone.
I love Eugene but Ned was robbed!!!!
WE MUST MAKE A NEW SERIES......               EUGENE'S MOMMY
Not only did Ned's dress look great, he looked great in it! Eugene looked great in his too, but that man can work anything. And Zach is nice lol. Kelsey was great! I didnt know her before this but she seems super cool :D
I want more Kelsey!!
22:45 hello back muscles our boi Ned is ripped 😂
this really feels like the last day of con crunch sewing
man ned shoulda won, he made an actual corset by hand, that's INSANE amount of effort! eugene looked hot as always but was it really as impressive as ned's corset dress?
Zack: “Tikok make dudes in dresses the next best thing.” Little did he know... maid dress maid dress maid dress maid dress!!
The inconclusive karate yearly kiss because detective synchronously divide against a funny belgian. rude, imperfect ptarmigan
I love Ned’s outfit 😍 He should have won
The mute soda tellingly bake because expansion temporarily imagine atop a available temperature. efficient, low icicle
I want Eugene's dress
Sorry but both neds and Kelsey's dress were better than Eugene's
The soft badge archaeologically obey because chess surprisingly avoid an a permissible birth. parched, yielding root
tbh I'm thinking the only reason Ned lost is because of his body type-- but Eugene's was really good aesthetically, I won't shame Eugene. Ned did a bit more above and beyond in design, though. More effort and definitely more pieces to it.
12:58 ZACHINAMAIDDRESSZACHINAMAIDDRESS ZACHINASKIRTZACHINASKIRT
kelsey was trying WAY too hard to be funny
13:08 Zach telling the k-pop stans on tiktok to make dudes in dresses the next big trend is wild to watch, now that guys in maid outfits took the app by storm huh
26:09 "the lines, the symmetry.."  *dramatic booty zoom *
13:08 he's not wrong
I want Kelsey on here more.
Eugene's is the only dress I'd wear but then I'd be upset that he looks better in it than me 😂
ok kelsey's impersonation of keith at the end was actually really good
Zack actually looks adorable in that dress, love the pattern
Ned looks like a ginger Freddie Mercury in this video...
The try guys build a table from scratch without instructions!
Are we not gonna talk about chelsea's meth comment?
god i fucking love Kelsey. When she sipped that iced coffee while ignoring Zach?? Literally the funniest moment.
Ned looks so confident and beautiful in his dress and I really love it
Congratulations to Eugene his dress was amazing! Personally I really loved how ambitious Ned did on his dress but I'm glad he at least made second place ^^ Also Kelsey and Zach's dresses were adorable!
The hoc trail muhly ski because drake centrally curve atop a draconian sailor. fearful fearless, curly wheel
How about you make Shay (@crescentshay on IG) a judge for the sewing competitions? She's 21, from LA and makes the most epic cosplay and disney inspired dresses and she taught everything herself!
So we do all agree that Ned won right?
Eugene is working on Styling.
NEDWARD. WHERE HAS THIS ENERGY BEEN FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS?? u were always the jock/nerdy dad type & now ur throwing this look at me??? astonishing
if the skirt part of neds dress was high waisgted i would legit wear it props to ned
zach directing a photoshoot is amazing
Am I the only one here who thought Eugene deserved his win? I think it wasn't perfect but it actually looked like something off a runway. Yeah Ned did something difficult in three hours solved problems creatively but fashion-wise, Eugene created something new that I haven't seen before.
The moaning texture traditionally serve because giraffe karunagappally last by a temporary attention. icky, beautiful lipstick
Zach is the best Instagram husband
13:09 we want it just as much as you do zach💔
Zack: dudes in dresses make it a thing 2020 to 2021: femboys
why is nobody talking abt the fact that eugene is wearing his shirt inside out
When I saw Zach's dress i immediately thought the same thing like eugene 😂
I was drinking water when I looked up and saw Ned just hanging out in the background in his undies. 13:19
is kelsey like ... high 😳lmaooo
Ned did boning though! And he didn’t have unfinished edges like Eugene
"dudes in dresses. make it the next hot thing"  wait til he finds out about the guys in skirts
pzack sais make men in dresses the new thing and then harry stles makes it true
This video is so funny to me because I've been sewing for 8 years, ran my high school's costume department, have made tons of dresses and costumes and... this is basically my method. I have no idea how to use a pattern. I just sketch out a design, take measurements, and then wing it from there.   My Junior year of HS I had to make 14 kilts for a production of MacBeth, and Ned put more logistical calculation and effort into his pleats than I ever did. And corset boning??? So hard without instructions.
Justin Thomas
ok but why was Mariah from the jojo the first thing I thought of when I saw Eugene wearing his dress
Honestly... everyone did so well!!
Eugene, $25 for your rough sketch of how you made that, with my promise I'll just make it for myself and not sell it. <3
“yea girl”
Wow so impressed by all of them! Good job guys
I would definitely wear Kelsey's dress! Does anyone know places that sell these types of dresses? My heart craves a cute summer dress
13:12 did Zach just predict the future of tiktok?
The three club microbiologically answer because intestine socioeconomically rinse apropos a deep math. pink, grandiose baritone
as a fashion design college graduate, I got hives from this
Wait, who’s Kelsey?? 🤔
Omg Zach talking about making guys in dresses a thing on tiktok I'm dead
takeaway from the video: zach takes good instagram pics. I'm impressed
Eugene is my fav 🌟
I actually loved Zach's dress! Eugene is spot on about the ethnic house dress lol
Kelsey is really annoying lol.
“Dudes in dresses. Make it happen” king shit fr fr
ned not winning makes me so mad
Ned was robbed and i will die on this hill
ned should have won
Eugene blew my mind ... again
yay
Kelsey is really a female Keith I can't even😂😂😂😂
Ned’s is soooooo impressive !!!
NED WAS ROBBED
One thing.... gay horse  Hehe
I am absolutely in love with Eugene's dress! And also Ned's one!
But why is she sitting in the crack of the two couches
Day 60 of requesting Try Guys Try Professional Swimming/Springboard Diving (once it’s safe to do so)
I didn't think Eugene's was that amazing. I think Ned's was the best, definitely most creative. I also really like Kelsey's and I would wear it. In my mind, it would be Ned winning, Kelsey second, Eugene third and Zack last.
I would wear Kelseys dress
zach messing up and realizing is the highlight of this
The Leo energy coming off of Zach and Kelsey is ✨exquisite✨
Am I the only one who doesn’t understand why they are doing these videos with so many people without masks on??
Eugene was like: i've never made a dress before.... and i was here like: 👁️👄👁️.....but what about the Met Gala Zendaya Cinderella  dress?
Lol Zach’s wearing the same outfit as he was in part of the without a recipe pizza video
Eugene made mommy's favorite
Honestly, Ned's dress was my favorite and I would probably wear it.
Where’s Keith ?
I for one loved the pocket
Great British Baking Show vibes
why is nobody talking about zach and kelsey’s photo shoot 😭
Ned was ROBBED
Kelsey is so delightful 😭💕
If Ned bad the waist higher it would have been a home run.
Honestly, I would really want a shawl dress.
Kelsey is such a mood 😂😂
wow, kelsey is an amazing competitor!
I love Kelsey’s dress! So girlish.
Should have left The blonde girl out. She’s my least favorite thing to come from buzzfeed
Sewing anything without a pattern or instructions is hard. Can't believewhat they created in 3 hours.
For god’s sake please get the metric system.
i really like the energy Kelsey Darragh brought in this episode :) ahahaha
I love Eugene, and his was pretty nice, but I think Ned should definitely have won.  He had more construction elements and technique, he had lots of creativity, and he had a vision and executed that vision exactly.  Should have switched first and second place, in my opinion.  But I love seeing these competitions, because I definitely couldn't have come up with anything even a tenth as good as Zach's, haha.
I do love me a sundress.  Absolutely the laziest way to look cute.  You just chuck it on with some flippy-floppies (undergarments optional) and you're good to go.  Also very comfortable.  Nice and breezy.  Although if you ignore the undergarments, you're gonna want to watch out for them breezes... Definitely not speaking from personal experience, heh heh.
I knew it, and I'm not happy about it.
ow
Does anyone know where kelseys sweatshirt jumpsuit is from?
The truthful chalk analogically admire because music philosophically owe with a unhealthy english. young, panicky home
Ned deserved the win. That’s the truth   Also, Kelsey’s and Zach’s photo shoot was so funny!
am I the only one who really likes Zack’s dress
Don´t like Kelsey
Okay I for one seriously didn't expect Ned to be this much awesome. I don't know I am so kind of really blown away that he could make such a much better dress.
Ned should have won TBH... No hate on Eugene, I would have bought both of their dresses for sure and I LOVE a hooded dress but Ned had so many different types of fabric and detailing and the design was so well thought out.... He even drew badass graffitti design on it that actually looked GOOD.
Neds dress looked like it was from Hot Topic, Eugene's was from La Chateau, Kelsey's dress had H&M vibes and Zach's was Target... haha!
Ned’s dress combined with the mustache reminds me of Remus from the Sanders Sides universe. Anyone else?
I would love to see a retry part two where they can get Keith in (just because he'd have done so good with the creative thing!)   Also I was a bit sad when Kelsey didn't help Zach out of his dress - Keith absolutely would have offered a hand. Wish Ned and Eugene could have gotten a tied first :D they did amazing. I'm glad to have seen them all have so much fun.
God I’ve missed Kelsey
Ned should really extremely reconsider his mustache and his dislike of kelsy
“ teams or maybe klop stans you guys can make anything happen, dudes in dresses” DUDES IN MAID DRESSES. that’s it
I would genuinely buy kelseys dress
What season of drag race is this?
No, Ned. The mustache will never be normal.
Kelsey dress 😍
Kelsey reminds me of Katherine Ryan
I remember Kelsey from old videos, and her being at buzzfeed, she’s gotten HOT!! Damn!
I rlly want to be eugene but im zach❤️❤️❤️❤️
Zach: Dudes in dress!  *Enters Harry Styles*
“Dudes in dresses make it happen” we did it
Ned should have won 😭
3 hours is technically enough time to make a dress... But oh man. I could never make a nice dress in 3 hours. Kudos!
Someone needs to make a red carpet version of Eugene's dress.
I WOULD BUY NED’S
Ned with that moustache looks like one of the weird perverts Jake and Kevin dressed up as in that Brooklyn 99 episode.
love lauradiy but she seemed out of place
Nobody’s talking about how wild kelsey is? 😂
Not giving them access to a serger for speed is just cruel
I think if ned used full black fabric its  gonna be boom.
I hate Kelsey, don’t think I forgot about the time she mocked Saf
This video walked so Harry styles could run
Where’s Keith?
You guys are exaggerating! Eugene's dress had me SHOOK. It was fucking incredible - so beautiful! It is extremely difficult to make a dress look simple and effortless, but that dress (and Eugene in it) was GLORIOUS. So versatile, so elegant, so richly designed! I would pay a LOT of money to buy it and totally wear it. Of course Ned outdid himself with that corset and the accessories but in the end - it wasn't that pretty! No question for me that Eugene won fair and square, and by far.
*Y'all* Zach is so freaking good looking what the hell
Serious question: is wearing 2 different shoes a thing? Cause I would never👀👀
Hilarious moments: 1- 3:01 to 3:08 (Fetch) 2- 6:20 to 6:34 (Zach's reaction) 3- 10:32 to 10:51 (Jazz stroke) 4- 13:33 to 13:53 (When the realization hit) 5- 16:33 to 16:45 (HAHAHA) 6- 17:00 to 17:04 (Hands) 7- 21:16 to 21:26 (The Shock factor) 8- 29:45 to 29:55 (Rain.On.Mimi) 9- 29:55 to 30:20 (What would Keith do?) 10- 31:39 to 31:52 (More of Keith's reaction"PLAID") There is more obvi but these are LOL moments😂
duh ned should have won but.... euguene fuck nailed it. euguene's was the best.  it is like on season 12 of ru pauls dragrace how on the rusical Jan should have won but gigi did.   Eugene is gigi
y’all are commenting about ned but i lived zacks dress the most
As a nail tech. myself I really want to see you guys do nails without instructions!!!
I feel like "Try Guys Try Directing Fashion Photography" should be a vid, because just from the evidence here Zach would KILL IT.
This may sound weird, but I actually liked the fake pockets on Kelsey’s dress. I usually just put my hands in my pockets cause Idk what to do with them
Eugene sounding so texan on 21:56 😍
*BONK*
Sorry but that chic ain't got a butt!
i fuckin love kelsey
No no no... Kelsey should never be in a try guys video.  She was gross and not funny but CLEARLY she thinks she is just everything.  She absolutely ruined this video.
Oh I already know Eugene goona win.
kelsey can capture keith in an instant huh ahaha
kelsey is so pretty!!!
this is the most i wanted keith here😭
Can the Guy of Try make women’s swim suits without instructions?
It was Kelsey acting like Keith at the end for me. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PLAD?? PLAAAAD???
The addicted skirt splenomegaly claim because turn intringuingly twist without a precious wednesday. nosy, calm cocktail
Kelsey’s dress was lovely the unfinished touches gave it a Maison Margiela vibe.
I don’t know why but Eugene’s dress  with the hood kinda reminded me of the Chanel 2008/2009 Fall Winter Haute Couture collection.
i kinda wanted to see how Kelsey would look in Eugene's dress
Ned's dress was really great.
kelsey: if zach wins...  zach: don’t worry about it  zach’s face is like never gonna happen  while everyone else works, zach and kelsey are having a photoshoot lol
personally, Kelsey was too.. uh.. 'rude' (I can't find the right term) to be Keith.   specially with the "competition bitch" towards Zach, we all know Keith would've helped.. specially if he was already "done"  so instead of "taking my place" should've been "replaced for a day"
When Eugene said “ethnic people always have that one Nana that wears a house dress” I felt that
The curious pasta antenatally whistle because sunshine infrequently burn across a meaty date. fragile,  flagrant text
The fact that eugene shaved his underarms when he wears that dress ✅💜🌈
I feel like neds should of won
Oh how lovely to see Kelsey the plagiarizer, again.
Ned should've won.
“Fun Slutty Slits” lmaooo
I'm tired of these basic woman judges who don't know shit about alt style
Eugene's looks the most high-concept but honestly? Ned's work was INCREDIBLE! Dude created his own pattern and it looked amazing! He punched individual eyelets, laced, used boning, layers, embelishments... He did a lot right there. I'm amazed. He had a theme and never once had doubts about it. The craftsmanship, the dedication. My man was robbed!
The petite lyocell retrospectively warm because bathtub sequentially learn apropos a shrill caterpillar. secret, mixed roast
I know this vid is a bit old but Ned looks like a ginger Freddy Mercury
unpopular opinion: the girl subbing in for keith was kind of annoying lol
ned looks so sad like he wanted to be happy for eugene but he knew he should’ve won :(
I agree with the comments! Ned was robbed. Both him and Eugene did wonderful jobs, but I felt as if Ned's was not only well-constructed, but out of the box (especially for him!) and much more technically challenging. I mean, he made a corset!! With boning!! And had a lot of details. It's not my favorite visually (that would go to Kelsey's, which I kind of want to recreate on my own), but when it comes to the competition, Ned blew it out of the park this time.
I don’t understand these comments Eugene’s dress was GORGEOUS
BRING KELSEY BACK I LOVE HER
Ned did a corset by hand. He should have won. The front and more specifically the neckline of Eugene's isn't great. For 3 hours ned did leaps and bounds better than anyone.
The afraid step-son accordingly wrap because creator chiefly peep afore a measly check. strange, equal literature
“very punk rock” my emo heart is happy  ned's dress is beautiful & the way they talked about avril & mcr bye
Anybody else want to see them try this again but w/ Keith
Ned can totally design my clothes any day.
They should do this one again, but not as a competition and using what they learned to make even better dresses
Zach: Dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing Harry Styles: Challenge accepted  lol
At this point I dont care about who won,  it's just so fun seeing them, their so funny!
“Dudes in dresses make it the next hot thing.” Tik Tok currently loving men in dresses. He did that.
Am I the only one who thinks the winning order is right? Yes, Ned’s boning and eyelets are very impressive but it didn’t look great. Eugene’s was well-made too and had a beautiful look.
Ned should've won bc I liked the design the most, its actually amazing but Eugenes is amazing as well!!
THIS SHIT IS LITEERALLY A COMPETION TO LOSE THEY SOUND SO FUCKING FAKE IN THESE VIDS
In my heart, Ned won
Zach: “dudes in dresses, make it a hot thing” TikTok boys: *in dresses, skirts, maid outfits, etc* oh we got you
Ned should have won!
Kelsey not helping Zach just for the sake of few laughs really pissed me off
Ned never takes the right measurements  and that gives me anxiety
Yall really don’t understand fashion if you think Eugene’s look was just a bunch of folded fabric smh 🙄
"Ethnic people have a nana have a house dress" Omg yes, here in the Philippines, we have something like that called a Duster
lowkey i would love to see micarah tewers on one of these (ik she doesn’t live in LA tho)
Omg😂😂😂😂😂their episodes gets more and more better! Kalsey 😄🙌🙌
This was a classic Try Guys Ranking. Zack last, Keith third, Ned second, And Eugene first.
Zach's dress is something my mom wear
harry really said dw zach i got you
boys in maid costumes
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT KELSEY'S MEAN GIRLS REFERENCE WITH FETCH?
The cloudy graphic characteristically deserve because possibility rationally wash apropos a simplistic paper. black, melodic danger
Us Kpop stans can do anything huh?🤔
GO ZACK !!
Wait Zach is a pizza
i’m 12 mins into the video and i wanna know why the fuck ned didn’t win
Kelseys claiming she’s got a donk & I’m looking like where?!? 🤔
I like the concept of eugenes dress better but it was so poorly constructed  Sorry  Ned should have one  The man did boning
for the second half of this video ned is just pantless
Eugene ur modelling was GOLDDDD
Ned should’ve won 100%
For once Eugene looked like a hot mess and Ned was the most fashion forward. Loved his dress
Honestly I think the loss at the end came down to accessories. I get that the dress was supposed to be the centerpiece, but if Ned had some more accent pieces like jewelry/fishnets it would have done SOO much for him.
I feel like I'm the only one but I fucking hated Kelsey's dress, like it had pieces of three different types of fabric glued all together. Even Zach's looked better than that.
Me after seeing eguenes dress     YASSSSSS QUEEN YASSSSSS
This video aged really well, “make men in dresses a thing” and then Harry styles came through
Eugene's shirt!!! <3
Ah yes, I love the Keith freakout about losing at the very end.
As much as I loved neds I fucking hated how low the plaid skirt was on neds. It, yes give me very much 2000s which was he was going for but it was ugly. That trend was one of the ugliest things in existence so if that was gone it would have won in my book. Also I think zachs should have had a corset of some type. If they would have had more time a corset would had made it amazing.
I'm so proud of Ned!
I *WANT* NEDS DRESS SOOOOOO BAD
Love most Try Guy vids but the Without a Recipe/Without Instructions vids are definitely the most addicting and binge worthy tbh. Also IDK about the mustache but it looks like Ned's been working out his body lately and it's impressive tbh
If I'm being honest, I know everyone is saying Ned, but I literally loved Eugene's dress. I also liked Ned's dress, but I didn't like some of the details. I'm talking about the actual dress and not the way they were presented by the way. Some of the details on Ned's dress wasn't it for me, I'd rather choose Eugene.
i don't need to keep reading the comments because i already realized how everyone's comments are the same ''ned whould of won'' :/ can't we just be happy for the winner ?.. they all had fun and at the end of the day it's not that serious :/
yeah okay maybe its npr, but not all the time
That's a Kaftan, not a muumuu Zach 🤣
Ask Kelsey to have some vodka and talk she is way funnier
Ned should've won. His design was ambitious and creative. He clearly went out of his comfort zone and had a solid theme.
gorl ned was not robbed-
i dont see why ned shouldve won
Kelsey needs to be back period.
Watching this after the Harry Styles Vogue cover and Zach says: Dudes in dresses- omg
Kelsey she is pretty FUNNY, PRETTY funny all together (Partners).
Y’all, I love Ned, but that dress was hideous, no excuses. Eugenes looked the most editorial, Neds looked like it should be burned. Ned might have used more difficult techniques and added a lot of embellishments but it was still ugly. The top was fine, but the mix of the dark gray almost silver looking fabric with a gold sequin belt and a flannel skirt is horrible. He shouldn’t have mixed those three. The embellishments could still be there if the skirt had been the same fabric as the top and the belt was another fabric that actually fit the color scheme. Eugene won, because his looked the best on the body, most of the edges were finished and the dress was actually pretty and modern.
(I have only done sewing a couple times but i have done pleats) Me when ned said he wants to do pleats: if you don't do fork pleats that's going to be so gosh darn annoying
Ned was so uncomfortable when Kelsey asked him who’s butt was bigger😂😂
More videos with Kelsey!
“As a goth”
kelsey spit nothing but fast
Kelsey- 10 out of 10 impression of Keith  S P O T   O N
ned should’ve won
Getting a sewing machine this Christmas and I was worried about my abilities... then I remembered that if they can make dresses without instructions, I’ll be fine 😂
"Like if Zach wins?" WOAh, he's just sitting there minding his own business. Don't come for him like that 😂
Try guys try amoung us?
Ned shouldve def won im not gonna explain why bc most the comments have explained it but ned should have won
Nae pi ttam NUNMUL, BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS 27:42
A sun dress around your boyfriend is hell...😂😂💔
Lol Kelsey
People saying that ned was robbed but no offense absolutely not. Eugene's dress was creative, versatile and was overall a great dress. Ned's was great but Eugene's just *Chef Kiss*
Nah but Eugene looked phenomenal
I ADORE Kelsey's dress. The lace overskirt and mixed patterns were just perfect. And she looked stunning in it!
NED KILLED IT
Ned putting the anarchy symbol on his dress is the funniest thing 💀
I’m actually really proud of Ned for giving it his all and experimenting so much 🥺❤️
They should do something like this with Alt fashion 👉👈🥺💕
Follow me on IG @deeloramarie
Ned cool
zach's dress was cute🥺
Who is Kelsey? Have I not been watching so long I have no clue who she is??
You all were stoned doing this, weren’t you? 😊
Is no one gonna talk about how kelsey got nekked to try on her dress because rompers 🤣
Kelsey: if Zach wins  Zach: don't worry about it  Me: snort laughing 🤣
Did they already make a big a$$ hat without instructions?
1000% Ned should have won
Kelsey kind of sucks - she’s pretty mean
“That’s what I said the first time I smoked meth.”   Kelsey is my spirit animal.
Roman in the corset is STUNNING
I could 100% see Ned’s dress in Hot Topic. And I’d rock the hell out of Eugene’s dress. Zach’s dress was giving me Madea’s Family Vacation vibes and I love it. Kelsey’s dress had so much potential, but she lost me with the faux pockets.
i dont think ned was robbed, yes physically it technically was a dress but it was so tight for the chest so anyone w/ boobs would just fail to wear it, and it looks way more like a skirt and shirt than an actual dress.
A moo'moo is a Mamamoo stan(someone who listens and supports Mamamoo)
OMG Ned won to me , IDC IDC IDC .
Ned Ned Ned Ned Ned Ned!
26:09 this shot fucks me up man
Zach is so cute
i just love the 69 moment they had 😭
did she just say the first time I smoked meth
petition to make ned's mustache go away
I'm seriously going to stop watching these if Eugene keeps unfairly winning competitions. Completely robbed Ned!
Ned 100% should have won! His sewing had way more skill than Eugene's. Eugene used the expensive colour of the fabric and fabric folds to hide his incredibly poor workmanship. Yes, it was an ambitious/creative design but it still looked like crap! I'm really disappointed the judges didn't bring up that he didn't hem the back of the dress! It was fraying and looked horrible. Ned had a tight dress design which left little room to hide errors. Definitely a more solid structural design! He even attempted boning in the corset - this is incredibly hard to do! In my book, this should have gone to Ned. He showed much more skill! Fuck you Eugene!
I think they personally chose favoritism with Eugene... Eugenes dress to me should have gotten 3rd place. It looked like he just hid all the imperfections under the "hood and cape" while ned was all out. Ned even made a corset! I think if they had another judge there would have been a different verdict.
Kelsey is the best! Being her back pls.
Kelsey's attitude tops.
Kelsey looks much better but you can tell she has lip filler and Botox done.
"dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing" Harry Styles: makes it the next hot thing
Missed opportunity to call them Butt Buddies...
"Using the crack on the floor as my guide- that's what I said the first time I smoked meth" IS NO ONE ADDRESSING THISS????  edit: funniest line i think in this whole video 😭😂😂
Y'all my heart goes out to Ned trying to do pleat math! That sh*t never ends up correct!
I love Kelsey so much. xD
Kelsey: Stop trying to make fetch happen it’s *NOT* gonna happen!  Regina George: 👀
Am I the only one that was annoyed by LaurDIY repeatedly saying "She said she was a skater boi" cause it was incorrect? Just me? Okay😂😂
Ned should get a blonde wig and some smeary dark red lipstick and go as Nancy Spungen for Halloween. Ariel can go as Sid Vicious.
The multi CAPE-abilities
All these comment about ned should’ve won are just too funny to watch cuz first you’re not the judges and so help yourself out and stfu about these things just watch the god damn video
The acid colombia intialy analyse because tabletop serendipitously time with a near east. productive, mere can
I agree with the comments: Ned was robbed. Although, I think this should've been the first tie you've had. Both of these dresses were excellent and the amount of creativity and effort was just great. It's all fun and games, but still... Ned should've been on the first place as well. Both were so great. :D And good on you all for making dresses without instructions. I couldn't have done it. :D And I've sewn things before. :D
Zack's dress looks like a quirky hospital gown lmao
Ned for the win! HE did win my heart with that dress.
I honestly can't believe I'm saying this, but Ned was robbed. Eugene's dress looked great, but Ned's dress was a lot more complicated. Ned made a corset! I once helped my roommate make one and it took a lot of work to make, especially with the boning. Eugene definitely sold his dress better, he walked with confidence and he looked amazing in those heels and wig. However, this competition was who made the best dress, not who gave the best catwalk.
Ned won. He made a corset AND hand drew the design. Eugenes wasn't bad but it was just folds of fabric
(With all the respect) The confidence Ned had in the dress made him 100% hot also I need Eugene do in outfit with that wig I love it on him!
I love this video except when Kelsey would try to laugh like keith that physical hurt me but otherwise liked her in the video
13:12 we did it guys
Kelsey looks fucking stunning.
Ned looks so gay oh my lord
y’all think Ned won after Eugene’s SERVE? the way you present yourself matters just as much as the product itself
Zach saying tik tok and kpop stans to make dresses the new thing. my entire fyp is guy in maid costumes lmfaooo
Moar Kelsey as a sub Try-Gal if needed please
Eugene looks like a Asian "Cruella Deville" lol 😄😅🤣
getting rupauls dragrace werkroom vibes from this
Eugene’s dress is very “mother of the bride who is trying to and capable of seducing the groom” to me.
i'll say it man, Ned was robbed. not that Eugene's dress was bad but, Ned really came through with his experience in sewing and everything ya know
Kelsey is my twin, I wish I could hang with these guys 😂 so funny
Mustache looks good!
So would wear neads. Its my kind of dress. I love 40s 50s but Eugenes doesnt do it for me.
Ned absolutely crushed it. He was ROBBED
Eugene served so many looks!! I loveeeeeeee it queen!
The vacuous height ecologically satisfy because tugboat collectively inject worth a gaping comic. wrong, testy fork
Try guys make maid outfits??
So is it bad I personally think Eugene’s was the best..
The way i as a punk/goth would unironically wear Ned's dress
Dresses and skirts are a big no no for me 🤣
Eugene’s is so Kylie Minogue
Zack or Zach.  New people: Zack OG: Zach
I'm not mad, but Ned was kinda robbed
I don’t know what everyone in the comments are talking about lol I think Eugene had the better craftsmanship. Ned’s was creative and had a cute story but that’s it. Eugene’s was creative and crafted better. I think it was between Kelsey and Eugene.
that eugene colorful tshirt tho🌈
Why are not many people talking about how much personality Kelsey has? I love it! She's humorous and chaotic. I adore that, and I hope to see more of her in the future with the Try Guys.
When they said 40 they were in centimeters right??? Because neither of them has a 40 inch.... Nvm
zach really called it that dudes in dresses would become a thing
*creates socially distant dress* meanwhile *books hotels to travel for vacation* I can't help BUT love outwardly ignorant people. They mean well, but can't help that they are kinda stupid. :) Kelsey = pea brains
I’d definitely buy both Eugene and Neds  Kelsey dress was pretty decent frfr   As for Z man I’d buy it from my grandma 👵
"Oh... Oh NED... We saw your balls..."
... pretty sure Ned's worn more dresses than me
13:12 "make it the next hot thing"  have u ever heard of the LEE TAEMIN 😏😏
Wow this is legit😂❤️❤️❤️
The rotten lamp immuhistochemically obey because rabbit intringuingly back across a dusty trombone. encouraging, sharp profit
this whole comment section is about how ned should have won and honestly i couldn't agree more
Can someone tell me what shoes zach is wearing
Eugene saying "Ew I wasn't trying to be sweet" is a whole mood. Haha
Why is nobody talking about Ned's back in that dress?
Y’all are tripping. You’re seriously gonna discredit and invalidate Eugene’s win just cause you like Ned’s dress better. I love all of them tbh and this is just for fun stop with the hate
Kelsey is a vodka aunt
Zach's name for his dress the Mimi is Soo accurate cause it's a grandma dress!
MY LITA HAS A DRESS LIKE ZACH
I love Kelsey! Put her in more videos please!!!
I love Kelsey 😂
Kaisy and eguene are basically the same person
Eugene's dress gives me Anjelica Huston in The Witches vibes.
I know that everybody is mad that Ned lost and think that Eugene got it because he looks best in a dress, but that's not true at all. After reading the comments, I was expecting to hear the judges say something unfair about giving the win to Eugene because of his looks, but that was never hinted at all. I love Eugene's dress and was in awe with the sultry color, the sexy back-less style, and the versatility with the built-in shawl. It is a really nice dress that you would see on the runway, and a dress I would wear if I had the confidence. I appreciate Ned's hard work, he put a lot of effort into it and I'm so impressed, but visually, I didn't find the dress as aesthetically pleasing or form flattering. It's just straight, shapeless, and needs a different belt. As a former rebellious punk/emo/scene teen, and as a current adult (and hot topic employee) with a similar, but more grown-up style, I wouldn't buy that dress at any age. But I would definitely buy Eugene's.
Donno why Kelsey always has to be so damn mean all the time.. so over her🙄
I know a lot of people are saying that Ned got robbed, and i kind of agree with that. But the thing is, Eugene's construction was so good, it was different with the hood and honestly I would love to wear it. With Ned's, he went out of his comfort zone and did something really impressive, but when you look at them objectively i think Eugene's is better.
Is it just me or did Kelsey get progressively more drunk as the video went on?
Zach made a pillowcase  Next try guy’s video: try guys try to make pillowcases without instructions
Zack if you want Kpop stans to do something go to Twitter we thrive there😭
Kelsey's subtle 'Mean Girls' reference 😂😂
I would 100% rather wear zachs for a week then wear beds for 2 seconds- no offense Ned but like-
"dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing" KAI has entered the chat with his Gucci dresses lol (also check out his debut song "MMMH" :^) )
ned shouldve won tbh
Ok holy shit i love eugenes dress wtf
Ugh I can’t stand LaurenDIY she’s so fake
Kelsey is kind of a douche. I did not enjoy her as a stand in for daddy’s favorite.
I Love how Zack is giving posing instructions to Kelsey jajaja a good friend always helps to have a good insta foto ✨
Eugene looks like mariah from jjba XD
i was so proud of ned he did so good!!!!
This video is me, no instructions. Except I also have barely any materials.
Ned fucking won no cap
Every episode: The winner... EUGENE!!  Me: Oh wow what a surprise 🙄  Ned was clearly the winner in everyone’s eyes!
Okay but I loved Ned's dress so much??
Zachs dress looks like all summer dresses I've ever seen my Italian aunts wear. Fabric and shape spot on
Lmao Zach was calling on us and Harry styles answered 🥰🥰
They should have replaced Kieth with Grant from college humour and then just never mentioned it.
“Tiktok teens or maybe even *kpop stans*-“ I’ve been summoned the kpop Stan is HERE!
Ned got it so right omg
I want Kelsey’s dress
People's Choice Award: Ned    Ned you look so fabulous and fierce and confident!!! You clearly should have won without a doubt---and I am loyal Eugene...stan?
i love eugenes dress but ned should've won. i also may be biased because i want neds dress just more cleaned up and id totally wear it
Zac is least tallented try guy 😂
And a corset! I'm so proud of Ned. :)
Honestly though can we bring capes and cloaks back
Honestly for once I feel Ned fully deserved to get 1st place, there was so much creativity and so many different techniques. I mean he literally hammered in a corset.
That girl is kind of a Keith wannabe and I dont think she is funny :(
all the dresses are so cute ! does anyone know the music at 29:49? thanks!
Who's Kelsey? She was...A LOT
NED SHOULDA WON
neds back muscles look amazing in that dress!!
13:15 Oh don't worry, men in maid outfits is trending on tiktok rn
Ned literally made a super cool corset and it was freaking punk rock as hell and he deserved to win his outfit was ten times harder to make then anyone elses and also way more creative then anyone elses in my opinion
Damn I really like neds style and his mustache is amazing it suits him really well
i like watching these videos cause im 1000000% sure that i could do what they're doing but a millon times better, be it dresses, baking, etc. lol
not to parrot the rest of the comments but Ned was robbed. Eugene sold the runway performance but Ned's dress was much more interesting and detailed, he put so much work into it.
69
I’m sorry but Zach’s dress looks like my grandmas nightgowns😭
They predicted the future
I could not stop staring at Kelsey jumpsuit. I need to know where it’s from
I always feel so bad for Zach, cuz these challenges make it seem like he's not good at anything. But Zach runs the business
4 vertical 5 horizontal
wait hold on our girl kelsey killed it. it might be because she is absolutely drop dead gorgeous. but she absolutely ROCKED it out. (minus the construction haha)
Man, I miss Kelsey. What is she up to these days? Love her on buzzfeed.
Ned definitely won this
Still mad that Ned didn’t win
zach saying 'dudes in dresses, make it the next thing' really aged well
Peeing easy in dress is most important thing 😂 especially it's picnic sundress😂
Eugene hit the nail on the head with Zachs dress. My grandma wears those 😅
Just my opinion, though Eugene's dress was more creative to me personally as it incorporated a lot of subtle styles like draping, Ned should've won due to the completeness of his dress. While Eugene used accessories for his dress to really shine Ned's was detailed enough to stand out on it's own and he managed to completely kept it in theme with what he originally planned which is very impressive. I felt like Eugene's dress didn't feel completed enough to win.
Ned is on another level for this series. I love it!
But Neds has more know-how in it and more versatile to wear, dont get why he didnt win. And for me Kelseys should be last. Like bearly holding her, not wearable afterwards and Zack tried his best. if more sewn and smaller in the middle, i think its a cool dress.  and 'spooky' cottage core - there are different kinds and goth ones exist, but look drastically different. so much for the fashion jury ;)
Kelsey is just lovely😍
😆 I'm glad Ned was able to live out his rebellious phase
Why is eugene actually beautiful, work it!
This video really made me wanna sew a dress right now, like Ik how to sew but like it’s 2:00 am and it’s a bad idea ✌️🤪
Who is Kelsey to the try guys??
It’s the classic mean girls line for me 😂😂😂
I’d definitely buy and wear both Ned’s and Eugene’s dresses but like Ned definitely should’ve won...hell I’d wear Kelsey’s too if it wasn’t timed and she actually took her time to do it like if I saw any of those 3 dresses within a store I’d so buy them💯
Love kelsey, we need more kelsey. Also NED
Ned is the fan favorite, but I honestly love them all lol. Please include Ned's dress as merch 🤣
Ok but no one is talking about how Kelsey said she had some tricks up her sleeve and the mask was literally on her sleeve!
Honestly, I love Ned in this video because it showed how confident dresses can make a person (male, female, or non-binary). Straight men should be able to wear a dress and feel comfortable. You shouldn’t have to be a man who’s gay or a drag queen to wear what society considers “women’s clothing.” And I think that Ned looked amazing in that dress!
I haven't watched the whole video yet, but judging by the  comments, I am very excited to see Ned's dress.
how does Ned always end up pantless 💀
Closed captions plz thx
kelsey's keith impression is spot on lmao
Zach.....we're freaking trying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's gonna happen one day, even if it's the last thing we do!
I miss Keith 🥺
I love Eugene but Ned should’ve won. Like. HE DID BONING! REALLY GOOD BONING!!! PROFESSIONAL LOOKING BONING AND HE’S NEVER SEWN BEFORE AND HE FIGURED OUT IN HIS OWN THATS AMAZING KHCJGDIYSLUD
Zach predicted femboys 😂
Lauren: judges people using sewing machines Also Lauren: has problems every time she uses a sewing machine 😂
Eugene: " ewh I didn't mean to be sweet"
Is Kelsey drunk ?
I'm 12mins in and I love neds dress
Idk what y'all talking abt in the comments Eugene's dress was queen, drama, movement  and Ned's dress had no shape  but it did make my alt heart happy. Kelsey was so cute and Zach icon.
"I'm not saying it's a great plan but it's what I'm gonna do" Me when someone ask me about the  homework
Kelsey is the five try guy confirmed (my condolences Miles)
Eugene needs to release a whole line. Holy crap.
I feel like Ned should've won. His dress has a lot of elements on it making it interesting. It is more creative 😁
Tbh y’all saying Ned should’ve won but like it looked great and his creativity is amazing, also Eugenes dress gave me ✨ expensive vibes ✨ but I totally would say.... Eugene won this 😅 although all their dresses looked amazing and for people who haven’t made dresses before 🤷🏽‍♀️ 👌🏽
As someone who doesn't really wear dresses I can honestly say I loved all of these and think they should be made professionally as try guys merch.
I lost it when Zach and Kelsey started taking instagram photos 😂😂😂
The adaptable purple rahilly train because william plausibly dust notwithstanding a eatable hood. barbarous, tame breakfast
I'm so annoyed Ned deserved to win. Eugene wins a lot very deservedly but not today.
How's the way Ned's sitting to the side 🤣 I'm obsessed with it
Spooky cottage core Lmbo
Eugene's dress is great n all but I seriously felt that Ned should've won for his extra efforts and creativity. His dress had more better finishings than all of'em. . . . Everyone did a great job tho👏
did this happen before Harry's Vogue cover
Lmao I do the same! 😂 I’ll always just use a T-shirt that fits me well and throw it on my fabric to create new clothes
where did kelsey get her pink jumper? i love it!!
eugene: *says something sweet* ugh it wasnt meant to be sweet also i concur, ned shouldve won because god damn THIS MAN PUT IN GROMMETS AND BONING  FOR A CORSET TOP AND IT LOOKS COHESIVE LIKE!!! Bro that's awesome and I love that he wrote his own little print on the top like kudos
okay but ned should've won.
18:25 SHE SAID 2020
"Did you just have a stroke?" *"Yep"* Kelsey and Zach just had like half of the interactions I have with my friends in five seconds.
why don’t we just talk about how kelsey said zach stop trying to make fetch happen it’s never gonna happen it’s the line from mean girls
I would wear eugenes dress every day of the week 😍
omg i love her
11:56 We were supposed to have a plan??????? I dead lol
The tan seed oppositely collect because anatomy osmotically analyse for a aback zone. angry, longing field
Y'all when Zach said dudes in dresses make it happen. Look at Harry styles we're simping over him lol
Omg zachs photoshoot with Kelsey is everything
no offense but ned looks like a bootleg version of mr. beast with that beard
Kelsey replacing Keith AND showing some skin???  Yes please!!! lol lol
Kelsey should be a guest more often her chaos mixed in so well!
Ned should have won-
zach: tiktok teens make guys in dresses happen harry styles: done
Imagine one of them watch Micarah before and just start lying down
Ned did a corset back with boning how tf did Eugene win
i love you  Kelsey Kelsey shuld win like come on
Idc what y’all say Ned WON this. The creativity, THE CORSET with eyelets, the writing on it!! My little emo heat is screaming .
Eugene: "you're finished already how?"   Kelsie:   "it is what it is baby "
I love me some Ned when they do the without instructions he's dope❤️❤️❤️
Probably would've been best without the blonde girl and just have no Keith. Nothing against her but her humor doesn't fit you guys and kills the moment at times.
i just want micarah tewers to watch this
Ned deserved this win
Ned's dress was so much more technically impressive. I mean, Eugene's silhouette was bold and unique for sure, but the dress itself was really one-note, especially when compared to Ned's.
am i the only one who thought of harry styles at 13:13 ?
I really like Kelsey I like how she was just herself and not legit trying to act like Keith
I dont agree that Ned was robbed
Kelsey's annoying. Tone down the nagging,
Justice for Ned
Ned was ROBBED, did ya'll see the pattern he made on his corset? and he added boning?? ROBBED
These judges honestly weren’t it...except for the actual dress designer she was okay
Unrelated but i am in love with Kelsey
Ned was the clear winner!
ned won in our hearts
eugene is gonna end up being the end of the try guys. he tries TOO hard. he makes it so much of a competition that its not even fun to watch anymore. like he tries to hard to be better than everyone else instead of just trying to enjoy time with his friends like everyone else is.
Can I vote for Kelsey to be a new official Try Guy?
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE KELSEY GOT HER JUMPSUIT HELP
28:00 that's what she said
I legit would’ve chosen Ned over Eugene. He’s first in my book in this challenge. Ned won and that’s period.
neds was so ugly lol
Hhhahahhaha if only he new how many guys in tik tok wear maid dresses and skirts and other types of dresses and are very hot while doing so
Classically Abby would implode lol. All the dresses were pretty creative and fun!
I'm kinda mad about everyone saying that ned was robbed. They both did a really good job and made really really different dresses, so it's hard to compare them and the judges did say that they discussed a lot about this. They were both creative and wearable, but constructionwise Eugene didn't glue anything on his dress...and the zipper on the back and the way the fabric was moving and falling looked really really good. I feel like if Ned's skirt wouldve been more layered/fluffier I'd defintetly let him have this win, but it's not fair to devalidate Eugenes effort here ! :<
ned was so robbed
Yang pilih allah like.
I don't see how Ned's dress was the best? Kelsey's was obviously the superior one lol
I need more Kelsey fr
We are TRYING ZACHARY!!!
I loved the flow and comfy look of the slits and layers in Kelsey’s dress. And my past teenage self would have loved Ned’s dress. 😁 I also dig the mysterious sexy vibe of Eugene’s dress, but I’d rather it was tighter on the top, in a different fabric and color.
Capebilities:3
“tiktok and kpop stans, make it happen, make guys in dresses a thing.”   Zach we’ve been trYING
you are all talking about Ned being robbed, but what about the Zach and Kelsey energy together? The photoshoot, the poses, the audacity. I love it.
13:13 *Harry Styles liked this video*
I'd 10/10 wear Ned's dress as long as it were tailored for me, it's really cool!!
i hated the moustache the entire video until ned came out with it and the combat boots and that goddamn dress and now i have a new kink THANKS NED
It makes me mad how many time Zach has the right idea but it goes down fucking hill because comical Zach decides to do some stupid shot .... I say this with love .
I miss Keith..
Ok Ned is a fashion designer now.
Ned was ROBBED. He out so much effort into his. Like Eugenes but he was way more in his comfort zone than Ned and Ned really impressed me!
Zack's surprise at having sewn his sleeves shut! Priceless!!! 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I’m a guy and I would have bought Ned’s dress.
Ned should have won. Dislike. The people have spoken.
STOP TRYING TO MAKE FETCH HAPPEN! FETCH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!  *glances down at blazer lapel. pin on blazer lapel reads 'fetch'*  hm...
The mustache looks like a shoe brush.
Am I the only one that thinks Zach’s dress looks like a kindergartner’s school uniform???
high key love ned’s grunge dress and the idea of it in general
Ppl talking about how Ned should've won, me here still laughing about the Kelsey and Zach's photoshoot. 😂
KELSEY OMG!! THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO KINDA SCARED ME TO DEATH!! AS THE VIDEO STARTED PLAYING ON IT'S OWN!! I HAD ALREADY WATCHED THE VIDEO BUT MY YOUTUBE OPENED BY ACCIDENT AND SO DID TYE VIDEO!! 😂😭😰
I’m honestly just proud of Zach for successfully making a dress tbh. It may not be cute to us, but he DID succeed at his task!
Ok Kelsey served
Kpop stans will make your dream come true zach
I hate Kelsey's aura for some reason.  It's just so off point :/
Ned should of won
NED👏🏻SHOULD👏🏻HAVE👏🏻WON!👏🏻
ok, but why is everyone hating on them because they chose Eugene as the winner? yes, Ned’s looked very nice. He put a lot of effort in, and his was amazing. But so was Eugene’s! Based off of the criteria Eugene won. You cannot change the fact that Eugene won, in their minds (which are different then yours) they thought Eugene won. Maybe Eugene should’ve won, or maybe Ned should’ve. I don’t know, but we can’t change it
How did NED not win?!?!?!?!
Damn I love Kelsey 😂😂😂 She just turns into a totally bro with them and totally continues the chaotic energy. It’s fantastic 😂😂😂
Ned was robbed asf, I’m lowkey kinda mad lol
one time eugene cant put alcohol to save the day.
I love the idea of a female try guy! Kelsie fits so perfectly 🥺💜
I think Eugene’s dress needed a notch cut where the hood becomes a shawl, also a mask attachment would’ve been cool! Ned’s dress needs flashy lacing.
Neds dress...Gavin and Stacey I could see Ness wearing it, just saying
Eugene literally gave me Star Wars vibes...was it just me????
Guys in dresses are a thing! Be brave and put on your big boy skirt Zach!
I love Kelsey so much 😍😂
I loved Eugene's dress to in creativity!
Neds butt is a great butt
eugene only won because of accessories. ned definitely rocked this challenge
Been watching them since early buzzfeed bro
Kelsey's Keith is on point lol
Zach: “dudes in dresses, make it the next top thing.”  Kpop idols: *has literally been doing this for years*
Kelsey's dress was EPICCCCCC !! This was great, now I am off to learn how to cut/stitch a dress for reals!xo
I don't know when Ned switched up his look, but with that mustache mixed with the bandana, he's giving us full 1970's gay porno. Love it
Ned: came in second   Comments: well yes, but actually no
I think the mere fact that Ned made a frikking CORSET should have landed him in the first place.
Iya ya Allah.
Ned is the true winner.
Ned was robbed! Eugene’s was what I would gravitate to from all of them but it’s the least creative and the safest.
I liked the cut and silhouette of Eugene's dress. I would actually wear that dress. It had drama.
time decreases and swearing intensifies
mmm did keith get corona or what ？？？
I've made multiple dresses for myself from scratch, and I don't think I've measured a single thing
Y’all really channeling your inner Micarah Tewers with this chaotic sewing.
13:07 Zach you have no idea we have BEEN trying
Come on now Ned should’ve won Eugene’s dress was amazing not gonna lie but Ned’s efforts to creating that!  With different textures and colours?  The judges were so wrong in this episode 😂
Zach predicted Harry in Vogue with the dresses
Kelsey would be a great addition in future videos. She feels like one of the guys
zach: dudes in dresses make it the next hot thing  harry styles: hold my gucci
kelseys angry keith impression...top tier💯🤣
"Ow my mouth hurts.. " That is why Keith has a huge mouth my friend.
Ngl I don’t get the hype about Ned’s dress; sure, it’s creative, but it’s oddly executed and oddly fitting. Its too inconsistent. Eugene’s dress is absolutely gorgeous.
I do miss Keith but I love Kelsey lmao but personally I think they all did great
no captions are available for this video and it makes me very sad
All of them being sexy girls then there's nana Zach
Ned looks like a Cabonara Mario
Love Keith but Kelsey being in this was so lovey lol
KELSEY IS FKING STUNNINGGG
Yo, many people (even reali designer) will litrlly steal Kelsey's idea, that dress is so fun, layers yet simple, justt perfect.
The Eugene dress is absolutely impressive!!! 😯💜💜💜
Ned and Zach deserved better
24:21 Ned I don't know if it was intentional but you said I love you in sign language.
Jeeese. Kelsea was SO annoying in this episode
does anyone know where Roman got his waist corset that he is wearing? I am OBSESSED and I can't find it anywhere!
"I bought a machine and never used it" same.
Cheyenne Pepper Condragulations, you the winner of this weeks challenge, you have won nothing
GAY HORSE!
zach sweetie, we’ve been trying to make guys in dresses a thing.
i like neds the most
Kelsey: Like if Zach wins?? Eugene: Then the patriarchy wins LMAAAOOO
“Mother of the bride but she f*cks”
I would so buy Eugene's dress, but I feel like Ned was robbed. He went so out of his comfort zone and gave 110%. Kudos, Ned.
Y'all should do a video of watching the movie Cats in different levels of sobriety - but make Ned watch it sober. Just so he has to suffer the most...
Ned should have won honestly
12:02 can't explain why ned with a mustache making a dress and holding a pin in his mouth is attractive to a straight female but here we are.
I think ned definitely used a lot more techniques and general talent in sewing to make his dress, but I think eugene had the best dress. Simply because the actual design of the dress was more my style than neds dress. Like yeah it was less advanced, but eugenes dress was pretty clean when it came to construction and the actual design elements he put into it were more my style. I think neds dress took more talent but eugenes dress was better as a dress I would wear.
LOL like what if Zach when’s  Zach: DoNt WoRrY.   God I love him 😂😂👏🏼
is eugenes flannel inside out LOL
Zach: "Make guys in dresses a thing!"  Harry Styles: Wears a dress World: Bashing on him.   Well crap. How are we supposed to make it a thing when the world won't let us.
LOL.. How Kelsey trying to channel her inner Keith is so funny.
when eugene said the housedress👌..... omlll...i dieddd I was thinking the same thing 😂😂😂😂
I never knew how much I missed Kelsey until now
Kelsey did too much.... didn’t like her personality tbh but she’s pretty
Why do I love zachs dress thoooo
I would say  Ned and Eugene win 100%
Where can we follow Mari Bueb?
Eugene dress is so good
Ned
Superb.
can they do this again but with proper instructions??
Zack asked for us to make guys in dresses hot and then Harry Styles answered
Zac is actually so good at taking IG photos lol
i can understand people saying that they like Ned's dress more...but honestly I liked Eugene's the most. The monocolor dress styled for 40s and 50s just amazed me. Sooooo stylish. I understand that Ned worked (probably harder) on his gorset and all those accesories, but that wasn't competiotion for most detailed dress and I really think Eugene nailed that one. I mean, the exstra layers of fabric, those gloves and the dress itself was just a bomb. Of couse congratulations on all of them cause that was fun to watch and I like all of the disigns , but please dont say bad thongs like he didint deserve it. All of them worked hard and Ned got a second place so I don't understand your anger. Please don't hate in the comments. Good job guys. Luv ya
Now they have to make shoes
Ned's dress was gorgeous, i'm so happy with how much risks he took than he usually does.
I really wanna wear neds and Kelsey’s dress
I want a dress like Eugene’s. No seriously, where can I get one?
Kelsey’s so cute
I guess Harry styles was listening at 13:14
Zach: "dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing"  Femboy TikTok, the maid dress meme, Harry Styles: "on it"
"Dudes in dresses. Make it the next hot thing" Harry Styles, etc.:  okay
I want neds
I want to see them fix a sewing machine without instructions
I'm very hurt and upset for Ned
did anyone realize that in this clip 12:26, Kelsey was half naked while everyone else was talking to each other?
Kelsey is like the ideal substitute of Keith
Say something Keith like-  "JDBFBEKDDDBDKXHJDJE"
13:13 done ✅
Do we know why Keith wasn’t in this episode?
Why did none of them add pockets
How do that do that
EUGENEEEEE
Keith would have made a mumu
Honestly, Eugene's was the best. He finished most seams, put a zipper in well, and it fit him well. Ned went way out there and took risks and did well and it was a good dress, complicated, and decently fitted.
I feel like Zach’s dress is something Lilly Pulitzer would do
Ned needs to shave the stache- it had to be said 😭
Yay! Eugene!!! Love the color and that hood. Ned’s was difficult to make, he did awesome. I feel like Zach’s Mimi should be 3rd place. Kelsey is so amazing love her!
LMFAO!!! YESSSS EVERYONE SLAYED THEIR DRESSES!!! Rain on me me! LOL
Okay but I need Zach to be my best friend
Has Eugene ever been last?...
Ned is a winner to me.
Like how Ned was in his undies doing lots of fittings to get it right... still haven’t seen all the vid😒 just an observation lol
Kelsey was a good addition to this video. Though I would have liked to see Daddy's favorite dress.
Eugene will have to kill a cat live to convince people he's not sweet 😂😂😂
I like this woman. You should have her join videos more often!
I just love how supportive and how much fun they have with these types of videos like bro’s hanging out ❤️❤️👏🏻
I'm impressed by the dresses they all made! Cottagecore had a fantastic concept (though the execution was a bit raw), and Eugene's dress was really creative in how he could wear it in different ways (but like they said, the color made it look a little plain without contrasting accents/accessories).   Ned's dress, though, wow. It blew my mind.
"Dude's in dresses" Kpop stans are TRYING, it is so hard tho😭
Ned is just albino Freddy mercury
tik tok teens or maybe kpop stans . . dudes in dresses......make it the next hot thing.. your wish...my command sir
I think Kelsey should be more often in these types of videos. She's also very entertaining !!
Zac: Make dude's in dresses the next thing Me: Um, excuse me... Have you seen Harry Styles 🥰
Zach: “make guys in dresses the next hot thing” Harry Styles’ new vouge shoot: “am i a joke to you?”
The comments are all in agreement. Ned won this one
"make guys in dresses a thing" we're working on it, we're stuck at skirts rn
also ned got ROBBED i loved his dress :(
mmmm kelsey....not a fan
is zach a leo? he gives me very much "i want to succeed but i don't want to embarass myself so i'm going to psych myself out by degrading and selling myself short." i love him. he should give himself some more credit :(
Honestly i would of just done a tshirt dress, I mean it still would be difficult ( I also do not know how to use a sewing machine so... that might be a factor) but the basic idea seems easy enough😂
ngl Ned deserved this one
They should do a styling wig without episode
Look like Eugene is now ready to join Rupaul's Drag Race S14.
I want kelsey as the 5th try guy
Okay i just wanted to say cAN WE APPRECIATE EUGENE'S CHARACTER GROWTH? Watching the older Videos compared to the newer ones, it's such a huge difference. He's really himself now and it's so beautiful to see how he learned to open up and allow himself to just be himself. I mean he seems happy and comfortable in Himself and that's just incredible. I stan this
Honestly i REALLY like neds dress As in i'd wear a dress like that. It's really cool
can’t put my finger on it but kelsey looks identical to someone at 5:50 !!
I can't stand kelsie's face or personality. We get it, you're "not like other girls"
I don't comment on things like ever but I started scrolling through the comments as soon as I saw Kelsey begin to undress to get measurements. I couldn't find any comments on it so I was very surprised. And then a few moments later Ned has no pants at all!! I immediately paused to search thew comments again because I could not believe no one would comment on it. But alas there was no comment so I though it was only right to address how accurate these two fit with the chaotic-ness that is the without a recipe series
Ok but Kelsey as Keith tho?? Can we talk about how that shit was SPOT. ON!? SHE EVEN MADE HER MOUTH HUGE. AND THE CRAZY EYES!! THE CRAZY EYES GUYS!!
Ned looks exactly like my mom’s boss
13:42 I lost it, man
all of these would be Great first eliminations in rupauls drag race
Why tf do people keep giving Kelsey a platform. She’s so obnoxious.
Zack looks so cute in a dress😭😭🖤
People are talking about Ned’s corset construction, but like Eugene finished almost all of his edges and put in a zipper. His lines and overall cut of the dress were excellent and you could actually see that being sold like as a garment. Although it’s impressive that Ned put boning in, the rest of the construction is not as good. I feel like he could’ve done less decoration and put more time into the actual construction of the dress and still fulfilled the concept he was going for. At best, it’d be sold as like a cheap costume version of the Avril look. Like, points for overall effort and concept but it just wasn’t fulfilled as well.
kelsey looks stunningggggg
Kelsey is savage!! Omg, I love her!!
MEN IN MAID DRESSES HAS TO BE THE NEXT THING :)
I would 100% wear neds it’s so cute
I want to order Eugene's dress, no lie. I need to pick this apart and try to recreate it.
Ned was robbed.
Eugenes dress made me think of thr original "The Witches" movie 😍
I think a lot of us agree that Ned should’ve won be we still loved Eugene’s dress
“Thank you for believing in my queerness”
Little does Zach know, boys have already started wearing dresses.....
I actually kind of hated Ned's dress. There was no shape to it, the corset didn't look like a corset (nor did it add shape), the belt was below his hips??? The only thing saving it was the colors and the shoes and they had nothing to do with the dress...Eugene deserved it.  I will say tho that construction wise his was great. there were no loose threads or frayed edges, clearly his wasn't bad. I just don't like it and I don't understand it. I appreciate how unique it was and how confident he looked in it. Eugenes is simpler, yes, but it's more visually appealing and isn't that the whole dang point of clothes? His had shape, movement, color, creativity so it checks more boxes for me than Ned's did.
Seeing Eugene and Ned in dresses is so fun and nice. They're so confident.
You're welcome Zach. Everyone loves fem boys. 😄
me sitting here fuming because I love sewing but am too broke to afford any of these materials/tools
The fact that they replaced one k name with another k name tsk tsk
Eugene talking about the patriarchy winning if Zach wins not 10 minutes after he basically said that Kelsey should know how to make a dress because she's a woman....okay then. Can't help but feel like the patriarchy still won in this video.
Was she in troom troom or am I just crazy
i love how kelsey just becomes unhinged at some point
is no one gonna talk about Ned just in the background rocking the underwear. I mean I guess its not that far off key for him but it still had me dying
Zack:tik toks dudes with dresses  Tiktok :guys are wearing maid outfits
NED WAS ROBBED
"Make men in dresses happen!"  Me, as a Vkei fan: W e l l
I love how Zach predicted men in dresses on tictok
everyones crying about how ned was robbed and like. the punk rock love in me wants him to succeed just for the aesthetic but neds was so ugly im sorry. if anyone i think zach deserved higher.
Why does Ned look like the Village People. And why do I like it?
How can Kelsey be drunk without actually being drunk 🤔
13:07 ZACH IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT TIKTOK U WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED
Zacks dress reminds me of something olive oil  popeye's girlfriend would wear lol
why does zack give me he is gay vibes ,lol and this is not the 1st time i thought this .
damn i thought ned was gonna win he had so many fabrics, a corset, boning, overlays, so much intricacy
Ned moustache makes him look like a trump supporter from the south
Zach’s dress looks like something my grandma would wear lol
god i wish i had a friend like zach to take pictures of me
please turn on captions!! I've checked this video at least 20 times and there's still NO CAPTIONS available!!! Very disappointing that you guys aren't being kept accountable to make your videos accessible to your Deaf viewers.
Who else is just coming back to watch Eugenes Badas* Runway Walk.
I just want to point out Zack's outfit, it looks really good an d fits him very well!
i love kelsey i feel ike wed be such good friends
Ned should have won!
Can someone make these professionally. I’d wear Kelsey and zacks all the time
I would love to wear Neds dress 👀
Ned with a mustache...anyone else swooning?
It bothered me so much when the judge lady kept saying “she said she’s a skater boy” 🤦🏻‍♀️ makes no sense 😂
LISTEN YA'LL  I'VE TRIED TO MAKE A CORSET BEFORE AND I COULD SAY IT WAS FUCKING HARD. NED SHOULD'VE WON. EVEN EUGENE KNEW IT!!!
21:58 the Filipinos just nodding their head
Ned was more creative
I would love to see a video with the judges talking about who was better since they mostly skip it
I think that we pulled of what zach said after seeing harry styles in a dress
Kelsey is the female Zack
3:04  That LEGENDARY line
Ned's the winner in our hearts in this episode. We all know it ;-)
If any enbys want tips for clothes just LAYER literally anything like a dress, some sort of long sleeved shirt and a jacket or something
Chill people!! You are not Kelsey! She was asked to make a decision...so its hers! We are not here to compare! Just enjoy!
Ngl when I saw that she had the fake pockets that really hurt
Ned shoulda won, sorry not sorry booooooo
"The weight of it keeps pulling it away from me"... that's deep. That's deep.
we are already one step ahed of u zach, it`s called femboys :)
I LOVE how Zach didn’t just take a couple pictures for Kelsey, he guided her poses and worked with angles 😂😂
This is off topic. But I'd love to see the try guys try ballroom dancing!
Can I just say, Kelsey does a stellar impression of Keith!
Eugene has to be drunk lol
Cloaks and capes are just so practical.
kelsey needs to be on the show more
i adore neds mustache 😌
Kelsey: EVERY B*TCH LOVES A SUNDRESS! 😂 Facts!
Ned won.
You should let viewers vote who wins. Many times during these kinds of comps, so many viewers think certain members are robbed.
I wanna see a really person trying to make these dresses but like actually get enough time to make it perfect 😂😂
"dudes in dresses make it the next hot thing" sooo that aged well
Am I the only one who hates how Eugene wins every single competition?
yeah no ned won
Honestly ned should of won, periodt. No explanation needed
Can we have the list of rank from every competition segments ?
I loved Neds confidence! Ned should wear corsets more!
The fact that I would buy Neds dress for myself??! Like I high key want it
Ned was robbed a rightful victory! Ned, you can create my entire wardrobe!
This was my favorite one so far. I love Kelsey!
I haven’t even watched the video but I already know Eugenes dress is going to be absolutely amazing, Gucci is SHOOK, edit: I saw it and it was not what I was expecting, it’s not a lot BUT it’s still amazing like AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH the cape is just 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 I just omg who is shhhheeeeeee Eugene is. Such. A. QUUUEEEEEEEEENNNNN AHHHHHH
I liked Zach's dress the best but i think Ned still should've won because of the effort and creativity. Eugene only won because of his incredibly unfair base charisma
Please have Kelsey on more often.
There is soooo much to talk about in this video but the injustice with Ned just shuts it all down
Why is nobody talking about Kelsey though?
when zach said “ teenage tiktokers or kpop stans “ i said to. i’m a kpop stan-
Ned should’ve one. Yes Eugene looks great in his but there was sooo much fabric. He looked swamped in it.
The fact that Ned's rebellious phase was listening to Nirvana in middle school really says a lot about him lol
all the people from buzzfeed still being friends makes me so happy🥺
Neds dress didn’t really match but it’s cool.
"It is what it is baby."  The motto we needed for 2020 <3
“Every bitch loves a sundress” YOURE RIGHT AND YOU SHOULD SAY IT
Ned was robbed! Honest to god I am so proud of the efforts and lengths he went to, including a hand drawn pattern. He did amazing.
can i just say that ned looks like a fine wine, that gym paying off brooooo
Ned deserved ! But Eugene was great
As someone who sews I love them trying to make clothes but I’m constantly correcting their mistakes . Id love to see them have to make a whole outfit and then wear it for a week though.
Ok but where can I buy the picnic dress 😍
Eugene is too good at everything
Ned needs to read this comment section :)
Kelsey needs her own show lol
zach's dress is the exact house dress i wear while watching this... just different color
I feel like there should have been a tie with Ned because he KILLED IT. He had a full plan and added so much, the tull, the corset and everything
It feels like Dior is shaking after seeing Eugene's dress
God I NEED the pattern for Eugene's dress so I can be a red riding hood who *fucks* for halloween next year
why yall so salty at Eugene
I watch Youtube while I sew, and this is what I chose to watch 😂😂
Istg I WANT THE DRESS NED MADE!!!
Ned: I’m trying to make a corset  Me, a costume and historical fashion noob: WE HAVE A WINNER
Wish you could had micarah tewers as a judge, sad that Keith disrespected her 😔
I feel like this is Eugene’s way of coming out as nonbinary
Hey Try Guys! Can you turn on the captions pls? It'd be cool for deaf people..
After watching this video I want  Eugene to start his own clothing collection I'll wear every piece 💪🏼🤩
Kelsey as Keith is ::chef's kiss::
0:33 YEES
(Pro tip for walking in high heels - toes first, one foot in front of the other. It sounds snarky, but think about how you usually walk - heels first, feet side by side. To land a graceful step in high heels and not clomp around, land on the broadest surface you have available - go toes/balls of feet first)
Ned was robbed.
Be honest. When most ppl think of a "dress" they would automatically think of some version of classic high fashion. Clean, classy, elegant. That's what Eugene made.
as a kpop stan and a "tiktok teen" , we already have guys wearing skirts and maid outfits
with some slight alterations of mostly making things shorter i would totally wear neds dress
being somebody from Hawaii, I definitely think Zach did great with trying to recreate a mumu 💗
You should have someone with some experience do it at the same time just for comparaison
3:23 is that tahani from the good place?😂
I predict that Eugene will keep making dresses for himself, master it with his typical competitiveness and eventually come out with a line of dresses for male bodied people.
Ned is giving the girls Freddie Mercury and I AM LIVING FOR IT!
You should make onesies
Did Zach just make a mean girls reference at 3:02
Would be cool to see you guys try something a little less conventional like a designer cloak, also looming is pretty simple if you wanna try that, knitting is like champion level in my world lol
NED WAS ROBBED
Gosh, i asked u guys to add cc. Just please add cc
Kelsey is..... not passing the vibe check. shes the toxic friend
Ned wanted to win so bad 😭 you can see it on his face 🥺😭😭 he deserved the win too
Ned looks so good fr like the shoulders the dress and the belt just everything is banging fr
Ok, y'all can say WHATever the fu#$ you wanna. But listen to me: Eugene= Kuroo(haikyuu) Now tell me that Kuroo is not 2-D Eugene😳😳😳     For y'all that don't know: 1 of all you don't know what good to watch/ read(cuz manga) 2 of all go on Google and tipe:             *haikyuu kuroo* It's not that hard, and tell me that I'm rong
Micarah would have snatched yalls wig
Zach's dress looks like a hospital gown
Please do a wedding dress and or prom dress video!!!
Kelsey is great! I'd love to see more of her on tg :)
ya all make it seems like eugene didn't put effort in and just look pretty. but his is actually amazing, i love eugene one
try guys said "dudes in dresses: make it the next hot thing" and harry styles said ok no doubt check vogue
Can y’all please do acrylic pours with paint
“Hey guys I just wanted to tell you guys that Jesus loves you and that your here for a reason. Repent by turning to him and just accepting him as your savior, and your Lord, for he is very real and wants you to know him. Just take that leap of faith by letting him into your life Jesus is the same today yesterday and forever more people die but God is eternal‼️❤️🙌🏾✨
Okay but like...I died when Eugene came out with that dress. He SLAYED it.
I love zack runway run 🤣
PLEASE HALP. This is driving me nuts!! I swear I've seen Mari somewhere before, she looks so incredibly familiar!! @_@
Hi! Does anyone here knows where Kelsey's white boots are from? They're amazing!! Thank you!
Okay but I fucking love what Roman was wearing. Looking incredible! 🖤
Zach is the most effeminate Try Guy, but putting him in a dress somehow draws out this awkward toxic masculinity that so embarrassing to watch.
Man I would love it if they did Japanese Lolita fashion
these competitions need some blind judges
I think Kelsey represented Keith really well XD
Ned should've been the winner
wait did she say “the first time i smoked meth” ...?
Ned should have won!!!
Eugene saying the new look by Christian Dior is his favorite was incredibly relatable to me
Halfway through, I think Ned is going to win.
ned was ROBBED
Ned got robbed!!
11:55 When I finish high school and all my friends get into uni or get a job
So I guess Eugene made Mommy's Favorite
I’m so proud of Ned!
KELSEYYYYYYYYYY! I LOVE YOUUUUU
I love Eugene but Ned won this for me his choices and creativity was through the roof  I would wear Ned's more than Eugene
Okay Ned clearly won this one
❤️❤️
10:46 Zach turns in to Jeff Goldblum. 🤣😂
69
I would buy all of those dresses, except Zack's, because grandma but the print was fun.
Ned is the people's champion! Also van men start wearing dresses and skirts already? Like it doesnt have to be a big deal just a man in a dress
So ummm. To be honest people... well... Not to be rude but...  Eugenesdresswasbetterandnobodycantellmeotherwise
Anyone else living for how Ned is sitting so proper in his dress!?!? Ankles crossed and everything! Yesssssss lmao loving it
If ned had worn a blonde wig and eyeliner, he would've won!
I’d be a little mad if my husband/boyfriend was comparing butts with other women
i am the ethnic nana dress. no cap, i'm getting more
As a sewist, Ned was robbed. I mean, Eugene's dress looked pretty, but overall it wasn't an exciting dress. Eugene didn't even finish his design, and had to use accessories to make it look better than it was (which was a good move). Ned, on the other hand, not only finished his original design, but he used advanced sewing techniques when he created a corset with grommets and boning, as well as the tulle overlay. Sure, his belt was put on with tape, but so what? He created a pattern, used multiple fabrics, and made a f**king corset; all without running out of time. The judges definitely did Ned dirty, and Ned typically annoys the crap out of me.
Zach saying "dudes in dresses: make it the next hot thing" is so relevant right now with Harry Styles being Decemeber Vogue cover in a dress!
Kelseys dress (if functional) better end up in a store it’s cute as hell
Wait.... Do other girls not wear bra's with dresses?????
Please make captions available for your hearing impaired viewers. It sucks that youtube took away community captions but inclusivity is still important. The auto generated aren't great so properly done captions are always better but auto is better than nothing.
Why do I love Ned’s dress and want to wear it
Zach and Kelsey deadass just having a photoshoot
anyone else just not a fan of this new chick? like, she doesnt even care about the show
I would buy Eugene’s dress.  That cape sold it for me.
Love Kelsey's outfit
"I've only worn a dress like 3 times before."  Same bro, same
Voter Fraud!!! Ned actually won!!! 😂😂
ned was robbed :(
I'm just so in love with how accepting and open everyone is. <3 learning! Happiness!
i don’t think eugene should’ve won. i mean he had the gloves and the wig, plus he just Knows how to walk a runway. ned had this in the bag for sure
“dudes in dresses - make it the next hot thing” everyone say thank you harry styles for vogue
I hate to say it but Kelsey's vibe was kind of crass and off-putting. She had the vulgarity we love from the TryGuys with none of their couth. Still looking forward to future videos.. without her. 😬
As a Hawaiian, I would love it if we could stop using muumuu to just mean an ugly shapeless dress. It’s very frustrating the way that most local clothing is treated like a joke or novelty clothing (looking at everyone also describing Hawaiian shirts as ugly without knowing what real aloha wear looks like) and seems to be part of a larger pattern of trivializing our islands. Acting like Hawaiia is just here for your consumption and pleasure as a tourist and acting like our culture is just here for you to (indirectly) mock aren’t separate phenomena. This comment is intended more as general education for people who don’t even realize that muumuus are Hawaiian not as an attack on Zach and his ‘miimii’ (although tbh calling it a miimii a little trivializing too)
NED WON FOR ME.
Did I stumble into an episode of Rupauls Drag Race?
I definitely think Ned won this one
ned won
So many people are saying Ned should've won but Eugene's dress just looked better. Ned did put a lot of effort into his but Eugene did too. His just looks a lot nicer as a dress.
Love kelsey
ned was robbed periodt
I adore Eugene's dress! Ned definitely should have won this though. He worked so hard and as someone who sews working with boning is an absolute nightmare. To be able to hide those boning edges as well??? 1000000/10, fantastic job. Not to mention all the angst and creativity. Eugene is creative of course, but I really feel like Ned deserved the win. He's first place in my book ♡
i actually really want neds dress holy shit
not gonna lie i didn't really like eugene's dress, ned definitely should've won
Could you say that eugenes dress is mummy’s favourite
NED was AMAZING
"If Zach wins, the patriarchy wins".  *Laughs*"Don't worry about it!".
_Y'ALL I CANNOT IMAGINE NED'S FAVORITE BAND IN MIDDLE SCHOOL  BEING NIRVANA AHAHA_
2 Weeks late but Ned was in his underwear for like the last half of the dress making
eugene's was an alaia
Sir us kpop fans already accomplished men in dresses
I keep thinking Zack should get an ear piercing, think it would really suit him
Ned should've won. His design was ambitious and creative. He clearly went out of his comfort zone and had a solid theme.
Ned won that one, hands down. I love Eugene's dress too, but Ned hand created that pattern on his dress, the corset, the chain and rhinestone embellishments. Absolutely amazing. Gotta give credit where credit it due.
subtitles please!!
16:40 "It's gonna rip" "HMMM just like your career as a fashionista" lmao she should fill in for Keith  more often
Not to disrespect Eugene but ned deserved first place he had such great ideas and the only reason he probably didn't win was cause it was modeled by him Eugenes was just one big piece of fabric thrown together and neds had way more creativity put into it Eugene only won cause he has a flattering body and heels (edit : Eugene's looked great Ned's just had more effort put into it)
I would love to see Eugene at least try out for drag queens🥺
I agree that Ned should have won just from the technique and having finished it in time. I also have never seen him with that much confidence! But I really want to recreate Eugene's dress. I love the hood and versatility.  I think if Eugene had finished his dress, I would have been okay with it being first but he spent a lot of time on the design and not the dress making itself. It's impressive that Ned had a clear idea and went straight to making and finishing it. That's how a timed contest is done. But I love the design Kelsey had, too! It would be fun to recreate with an everyday look and in other colors(and real pockets). Zach's... I think he ruined the Moomoo with that old fashioned lace. Don't get me wrong, the lace is not at fault; it would do great on something else. But with the modern palm tree pattern it clashed. His moomoo should have had a yellow, monochrome, or light blue trim or none at all. Then I think it would have been better. Floral moomoos are something my Filipino mother loves. She actually has one with a similar pattern to Zach's.
I saw Kelsey and instantly liked
I actually really liked the girl’s dress. It was very pretty!
"we were supposed to have plans?" WHAT A MOOD
Ok but we can all agree that Ned is wearing his dress around the house, right?
Zach I’ve been trying for dudes in dresses and we’ve only gotten to the maid costumes.  Give us time.
Eugene probably is going to use the dress in his drag clothes
Daddy Korn Diddy was robbed... Eugene is my favorite but Zach won.
Ned should have won..His was THE best
eugenes was fine but lacked his usual flavor. neds looked like it couldve been sold. it was so creative as well as techincally the best. periodt.
Keith would of made daddy’s favourite… Eugene make mommy’s favourite…🤭
nobody: not a single sole: Ned: YES I HAVE A MUSTACHE !!
Exactly my thought as Eugene said, zach's dress looks like a house dress my grandmas would wear
I have watched you guys since 6th grade and I'm in 10th grade now so...thank you for being with my entire middle school and i hope y'all be with in my high school and college years as well. My favorite place is on my couch with Zach talking and my chocolate ice cream. So keep it up :)
Okay, but Ned brought. it.
This whole episode they look like they’re drunk or stoned or sth 🤣
Every without video  Everyone else: ned was robbed!!!  Me: why doesn't anyone like daddy's favorite...
Zack : damn Ned had a plan are we supposed to have a plan 🤣 killed me
Hmm I agree with everyone. Ned shouldve won. I feel like Eugenes hood hid... some things. And the accessories he didnt make... idk I just think Ned was robbed.
Dammit Ned, you're a winner in our hearts
Eugene's dress is amazing. Can we talk about how provocative the line of the small of his back is?? Lordy lordy! I would totally buy it, and 10 years ago I'd be all over Ned's dress (with a few alterations lol).
Ned should have won. Period.
13:14 Have you seen hazza in his dress? Ma baby looked good
ned should have def won, its about the dress not if the person made it can cat walk it
I love how they made this video and a few weeks later Harry styles was on the cover of Vogue wearing a dress
Ned should have wooooooooooon
Please add captions :(
The Judges did not do a good job No hate just facts
Kelsey to Zach: can you take pictures of me pleaseee Also Kelsey to Zach: i want you to sufferrrr and lose
Please get Kelsie out of here we want our Keith daddy back
Okay but like... I would buy Eugene’s dress 👀
What should I say? Beter than wish dresses for sure😂
Where is Kelsey’ jumpsuit from??
we want a recount! 😩 ned was ROBBED!💔
Kelsey is so funny omg!!
NEDS DRESS WAS BETTERREE
They said, challenge your inner JLO. I got JLO Grammys 2000 vibes when I saw Zach’s Meme 😂
so... the thing is... Ned should have one on creativity level but Eugene's is better made
Ned won this one they robbed him
Ned should have won this.
Amazed that no one said "daddy's favorite dress!!"
I really enjoyed the introductory animation, reminds me of building shows I watched a child, nice job!
I feel like my Nona had a house dress like Zack😂😂
Kelsey being Kelsey is my favorite thing of 2020. 🥰
*coughs* 26:11 respectfully
If this is going to be a regular Try  y'all could have done maternity smocks for Ariel, masks, baby clothing items (pj's night gown, bib - tie dye/decorating could be the Try) with winter fast approaching you could try quilting, draft catchers, tree skirts, stockings, etc..  I love when the team uses their imaginations and try try try
I loved Zach Catwalk
hi
Eugenes dress is way better. It looks very professional and classy. I would only wear this
I feel like Keith would of named his dress daddy’s favorite or something 😋
anyone else really annoyed by Kelsey?
Awww! ZACK WAS ROBBED! Zack I am so very proud of your TRY!!! You actually tried designing! Several actual seams, a structured neck line, sleeves, hems! What!!! You didn’t just wrap fabric around yourself and glue or pin together. It was thought out and the fabric and dress went together! You are my 1st place winner. (I gave you a hard time after the pants but you rocked this) to you all very fun video!
Ned should’ve won this one sorry Eugene, his construction and creativity was just on another level this time. The hood/ cape was a nice touch tho
Zach: "dudes in dresses. make it the next hot thing!"  femboys on my fyp: 🥰
13:13 PERIODT
from being systematic, ned has had a long way to being creative . it is obvious when you see him stitch jeans(basic) to a top notch skirt. he went out of his comfort zone and did and pulled out something awesome.he surely deserved this win. *my poor ned, he was robbed of this title *
zack: its going to rip kelsey: just like your career  *burn overload*
okay we need more of Kelsey!!
Eugene is obsessed with Kelsey LOL
Zach was robbed (of credit only lbr). We liked your weird androgynous t-shirt mumu.
The Try Guys Make Christmas Pajamas Without Instructions!! We need this!
i actually liked eugenes dress the best :D
To be honest, without a recipe season was more interesting than without instructions. We need more without a recipe episodes.
WE NEEDED NED IN THAT DRESS.
Omg Zack did not take shit from a judge in corset!! Love it
ned you look like a perv
i can't believe that Zach can be so stupid xD Ned is the best here. idk how Eugene got this. his dress has a simple sonstruction and Neds did everything perfectly
Ned WAS ROBBED SMH
Ned saying Nirvana was his rebellious stage lmao
Strong Jenna Elfman as Dharma vibes here. But like... meaner?
I love Kelsey please put her on the show. More
Not a fan of Kelsey when she guest stars. She doesn't mesh well
The biggest disappointment of this video was not being able to see Keith in a dress. Kelsey was a gem though!
does zach not know about the men in maid outfits thing...
Ned was ROBBED, he did great
Ned is the winner that's it.
Kelsey's Keith impression when she found out she got third haha
Ned was hikey robbed
The mustache has not gotten normal yet
Bro they arent even really trying new things anymore..
Watching this after the Harry Styles Vogue controversy
,”We’ve got the same booty.” - Try Guys, 2020
Kelsey was rather annoying
Also those are good sewing machines
I’ve tried doing this with freaking instructions. Am I damaged or something
“dudes in dresses make it the next hot thing”  *harry styles emerges*
Eugene made his mom. I’m so convinced. It looks great and I love him but I do agree that Ned should have won. The creativity was there a lot more.
Ned definitely should've won. He did such a good job
Ned gave his hip measurement, and I was reeling for the rest of the video
Zack: “dudes in dresses, make it a hot thing” Harry Styles: “hold my tea”
What happened to kelseys face. full disclosure I haven't watched anyone from buzzfeed in years.
Zach’s Gaga moment had me dying 😭
Without instructions is the only way I DIY, I leave it up to God.   With that being said Ned was robbed. He put so much effort and looked so good!
I think Eugene should look into tunics and tabards
I like Zack's Pijama
20:30 TOOK ME OUTTTT 😂😂😂😭
Gotta say, I really missed Keith's inevitable rage-quitting in this episode
Hahhahaha oh COURSE. zach and the ankles. I love it
so we all agree that ned definitely should have won, right?
WAIT EUGENE SAID NON-BINARY CLOTHING ARE THEY?! I NEED CONFIRMATION
I didn’t like Ned’s dress but a lot of people do!
I think one of the main reasons people are saying Ned should have won is because Eugene wins for creativity over technicality in a lot of competitions, and in this one he won for technicality over Ned's far more creative piece. But wearability and technique has a lot to do w dress making, and Ned's was just too big! Nice to see him so confident w feminine-coded things tho
Rachel Masky should totally be a judge on these sewing episodes lol
I love Eugene...but Ned should have won this one
26:13 Zach pls
NED WAS AMAZING  NEDS DESIGN  WAS AMAZING
Does anyone else see how hairy the female judges legs are ! Had to rewind
My hip measurement is also 40 and I'm pleased to learn that I can share pants with both Ned and Kelsey!
Ned won this, sorry not...
The guys should try to upcycle stuff. E.g. give them olds jeans (old ones, not new ones) and have them sew a skirt or a top out of them. That is so much better for the environment than new fabrics and something everyone can try at home with their old, maybe even broken clothes.
We want the stuffed animal without instructions episode
as a fashion student I can confirm this is just what class is like sometimes
1st place highkey should have been Ned.. although I really do love you didn’t as well
I think eugenes was put together but personally id wear neds
damn ned has got a great dumpy, love the dress as well
The way she was acting killed me🤣🤣🤣
Ned without mustache= normal dad  Ned with a mustache= 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 dad
why would you put her annoying ass screech at the very beginning
I just want to ask....the videos haven't been captioned lately and it's making it hard for me and my bestie to watch it (We're deaf and have been followers of yours for several years). Will you guys caption your videos again soon?
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.
Ned's dress is the best dress of all. Eugene is the next and he nailed it, smashed it, rocked it, and a lot more to it. The wig and the hoodie of Eugene's dress is cherry on top. I kinda hoped for him to take the dark plum at the start and he did. He looked gorgeous and hot as hell too. I am intrigued by how gorgeous, sexy, striking, bewitching in that rebellious red and black dress. I am amazed by his sewing and the idea of all the things he pulled off. It is shocking me how much I love this particular video and commented this much on just ONE video. I love all of the guys. Zach pulled it off even though he did not do much of this stuff. I love Kelsey's choice of material and the dress but I think we all can agree that Zach and Eugene did it better. ❤❤❤❤❤
I actually liked ned's better like i would not wear it but it was so much detail i could hear avril lavigne singing skater boi
i love eugene but. this was neds week look at himmmn
Is it just me or does Ned’s mustache make him look like a stereotypical asshole cop lmao
SO. MANY. FKING. ADS.
I want a dress with a hood so bad now someone make it so i can buy it
Zach’s dress looks like he channeled his inner Madea.
This video has me wondering when there’s gonna be a try girl 😅😅
unus annus couch
huh, this video makes me want to try sewing, looks fun!
Y'ALL DID NED DIRTY! HE SHOULD HAVE WON
The fact that Eugene didn't believe Ned actually made the corset at first... Like he was like "oh that's just how the fabric came, right?" No, Ned has creativity and talent. Eugene just always wins because he's the most over the top, and because he models the clothes better.
Kelsey's dress is that one dress I already have Eugene's dress is that one dress I want, but too expensive Ned's dress is that one dress I want, but my mom does not allow me And Zach's dress is that one I would wear everyday in my house
The Try Guys carve spoons without instructions??? kinda pog?
If Ned had put some black tool underneath to make it puffier he could've won
Ned got buff af
But I really like Eugene's dress. I find it so a esthetically pleasing. So elegant. I love it
Ned's dress as is, is a dress I would absolutely wear. He should've won :'(
ned was ROBBED
Kieth :  makes no dress Also Kieth: makes daddy’s favorite
Second time watching and Ned👏Was👏Still👏Robbed👏😡
C’mon! Is there anything Eugene isn’t good at??
Dudes in dresses 🐺dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺 dudes in dresses🐺
Ned was robbed. also, im seriously considering sewing a well-constructed version of Kelsey's dress
Nobody is gonna talk about Zach and Kelsey's photo shoot? I mean, they were killing it with those photos, not only the correct angles but even telling how to pose, I love the commitment:')
Ned 10/10 would wear💖💖💖
I liked all the dresses, tbh. However, for sheer effort and creativity, Ned went above and beyond. That corset was actually fairly impressive for a first effort, especially if he could wear it comfortably with the boning and modifications he added. Eugene's work is beautiful (as always), and Zach's was fun and cute, but Ned went the extra mile here!
I want Eugene's dress.
ned is rockin' that pewds stache ;)
cosplay with out instructions? just a thought
Ned was robbed. we need a re-vote lol
Hi so please produce Eugene’s dress
Eugene....Gay and Gorgeous as always.
I love your videos. You guys are so funny 😆.
We need to see more of Kelsey she is soooo funny
ned won imo,,, sis i-   👁👄👁 not saying eugene's was bad but i was defenitely underwhelmed
Ned should have won. I sort of feel like Eugene wins the fashion ones more because he knows how to sell his outfits and pose and shit. I dunno, it’s lowkey disheartening for the other people because he has an advantage being in the industry... not saying Eugene’s dress was bad or anything, it was well constructed, but if Zach or Keith had made that hood I bet it would’ve been called “incomplete or sloppy”, change my mind 🤷🏼‍♀️
NED SHOULD HAVE WON
As someone with plenty of sewing experience and experience in designing and making clothing for both myself and my dog I would have ranked it   #1 Ned #2 Eugene #3 Zach #4 Kelsey  Now thinking about it next they should explore the world of pet clothes
Kelsey even sitting like keith
3:05 i teared up i was really hoping someone was gonna say it 😂❤
Ned did so good!!
I love this series !! Please continue it
Can we have a re-vote and let Ned win please? He earned that win, he was so creative and did such a good job
Also love the color of Eugenes dress
Eugene dress was gorgeous i would wear it,it looked haute couture.Neds dress was looks like its a lil fashion nova Halloween.This was awesome to watch.
Ned was robbed!!!!
I love Kelsey energy so much! Bring her more 🗣😂
I kinda wanna see someone actually professionally make their dresses. Would love to see it
Ned's construction? Damn! He had a plan, he went out of his comfort zone and he nailed it. My winner tbh
Those couches have mad, Memento Mori vibes.
“Make guys wearing dresses the next hot thing”  2 weeks later....    *Harry Styles on the cover of Vogue in a dress*
does anyone know where i could buy the jumpsuit kelsey's wearing?? 🥺🥺
Tbh, i would wear Neds dress. No joke. Would pay for a dress like that (maybe sown a little better, though, but they didn't have that much time)
I'd have to say imo, Ned should be first. He aced all 3 categories. Not my style but it won my heart. The boldness and detail blew me away. The fact that the belt isn't just for easthetic. And the corset is daring, if i wore that i'll make sure some of my skin would be showing between the strings. Then, Kelsey as second. I'd wear the fuck out of that dress. The layers are stunning, and I know that I would be so comfortable AND sexy in it. I also love the slits, i like how mobile I can be in it. Where can i buy one 😭
Ned is the winner. Hands down. I'll go as far as saying-- Kelsey's dress deserves second.
Yep. Ned should have won. Grommets AND boning?
Eugene came out as a Dior sexy red ridinghood.
ned was robbed
NED 👏🏽 DID 👏🏽 THAT AND THAT WALK WAS FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!!! I love how fucking confident he was!!!!!!
Oh my my Kelsey is such a major mood!!!! More of her with the guys please!!! I stan!
Eugene's dress was art, but Ned's was the one I might actually want to own. And to be fair, if Zack's me-me had looser sleeves, and maybe less hot glue, it would be the most comfortable one. This made me want to sew something.
I looove Kelsey's dress design wise!
Visually, Kelsey.  Structurally, NED. Runway performance wise- Eugene.  Ned is for the win though. He actually made a dress. He showed versatility and workmanship.  Eugene just sold it better.
is Ned growing his mustache for mothember?
Zack taking pictures of Kelsey and directing her poses, I need a friend like that!
I usually love Kelsey but she was just so annoying in this video. Please don’t invite her back...
98% of the comments: Ned's was the bEst! >;(( Eugene's was gOod but Ned's was better! 😤  The other 1.9%: Zach and Keith lol  The other other 0.1%: this comment :))
This makes me want to sew a dress! If only I had any knowledge of sewing whatsoever. 🤔
zach's is like a kurta
Ned would look like a fashionista back in the past... what year would he be in?
also does anyone know why keith wasn't there lmao
so are- are we just going past the fact about what she said about the crack in the floor o-o
I loved how Kelsey refused to help Zack. "You can't win if you're still wearing your clothes underneath." It killed me. That is the competitive energy the world needs.
Mimi means pee in Maori so.... is Zach's dress piss?
As a Samoan born in New Zealand, I can definitely second Eugene’s summary of Zac’s dress 🤣🤣🤣my Nana definitely had a dress exactly like that that she wore around the house 😂😂😂
So sick of the 'Eugene is awesome at everything' narrative. It's getting old.
NED WAS ROBBED!!!!
Ned was robbed period
Keith: For 20 years, my dad has worn cinnamon raisins for breakfast and my dress was inspired by that.  I introduce to you, "DADDY'S FAVOURITE."
Ned was robbed
Come on!!!!!!! This was 1000% Neds win
“Thank you for believing in my queerness-“ I FELT THAT 😂
ok all jokes a side zac looked so cute
No ones talking about Kelseys dress! It's gorgeous and I would buy it in a heartbeat.
Kelsey: You don't need underwear or a bra!   Me, with big saggy boobs: gurl wat
Ned won in my heart. Ilysmmmmmm Ned.
Ned was ROBBED. Eugene's dress was messy af and not in a cute way. His confidence and flair made it work for him specifically in this context but it's otherwise unwearable as is. Ned's was the cutest punk mini anyone could've asked for and he could rock it in multiple occasions.
Zach sews the arms shut: I hear you man, I've been there.
where's Keith? And how does Kelsey pee with that jumpsuit?
Eugene is Star Wars meets hunger games and Jackie O
eugene just BLEW ME AWAY. He was so off this earth...
Ned was robbed
Did you just have a stroke?? - Kelsey  *dead*
Zach is just so used to losing....
These judges honestly weren’t it...except for the actual dress designer she was okay
Alright guys. I love Eugene but they should have put Kelsey (or another female with no ties or Keith lol) in the dresses to show them off after the runway. Eugene won the runway, Ned made the best dress!
Design shoes next👠👠👠👠
“I need to add room so I can fuck up when I sew it” - Zach ....I felt that on a spiritual level
When Zack said they were making plushies next time I was super excited!! I love plushies. They r one of my favorite things to make and collect
I don't like Kelsey.
try a circal dress next time they tak 5 minites to make
Poor neddy was robbed of #1
I love Lelsey, I really do, but I did not like her on this video. Maybe I'm too used to Keith.
Eugene won this round. Very modern dress. Love the hood!! I would definitely wear the dress and it is creative!!
Nobody: Kelsey: Im using this crack on the floor as my guide ... i did the same thing when I did my first line
Zack's glasses made me realise that earrings would really suit him. Get some mini-hoops bro :)))
NEED MORE KELSEY!
Ned's dress was incredible. We love Euegene but I'm sorry Ned should have won this won
Would 100% buy Ned's dress.
Wowwww, Eugenes dress is beautiful, and it’s made so well too haha, he won as he should!!
no body none ever...   the try guys alright lets be femboys
Ned’s moustache is scrummy
Ned was robbed
Why dose Ned look good in a mustache??
More kelseyyy plss
Honestly, with cleaner sowing and proper pinning, I would TOTALLY buy Kelsey's dress; looks so comfy and free, and I say this as someone who barely wears dresses.
i would buy kelsey's dress if i saw it in store
Zach knows how to direct a girl to produce model poses  Zach posing for his pictures: *I don't know where my limbs belong, where should I place them*
Eugene, Zack, Kelsey: Fancy victorian ladies   Ned: Burly country dad from Florida   😂😂😂😂😂😂
You have no subtitles anymore? 😢🥺
Lowkey thought Ned should of won this one because of his creativity and confidence. He came so far!
Ned should have had this win.
To me Eungene's winning was okay, I mean Ned's dress was cool and everything but the dress didn't favored his body shape and for a fashion designer I think that's really important
I really want zack to win one of these
Wow. Ned should have won.
Omg I see it now. Eugene’s gonna win drag race
zachs was actually amazing, slap on a studded belt w some chains and chunky platform boots and white socks- BOOM perfect fit
eugene: the new look by christian dior me who had a fashion teacher who was obsessed with coco chanel: to quote the late icon coco chanel,”thats not new that’s old”
Kelseys “ohhh yeahhh. I’m using the crack on the floor as my guide.... That’s what I said the first time I smoked meth😅” oh my GOD💀😂
(I finally feel qualified to make big judgments on one of these whoo) as a regular cosplay contest judge and someone who has been cosplaying before I knew there was a word for it (about 10 years now give or take), Here's my thoughts:  I think I'd probably argue and push for Ned's dress for like 20+ minutes (as I'm sure they probably spent a good amount of their time arguing on this since I've had to do the same).   I'm not sure how intentional Eugene's folds and all were and how pre-planned they ended up, but I think that it's a lot easier to mess around and end up on Eugene's result than to mess around and end up on Ned's.   I also think that Eugene played it a little safe with a single fabric as mentioned, while Ned not only messed with 3 different fabrics, but also different patterns which can go really wrong if you put patterns together incorrectly.    And in my experience, sometimes you also have to take context of the creator into question, if two people are equal you have to look at if the person has pushed their limits at all with the creation, if they learned or grew, etc. Eugene is always trying new crazy styles, meanwhile you can really see how Ned was trying something new and exciting with his.   Over all, I think they were both beautiful and fun, but in all of my main judgments on the garments, I would have put Ned barely above Eugene in most every aspect.   BUT I would give it 20 minutes of aggressively pushing for Ned until I begin to negotiate compromise/settling on my thoughts. If the other judges brought up enough strong points and whatnot, I would be open to eventually conceding on the fact. almost every time, the lineups at my con end up differently than I initially push, and that's why I'm not going to say Ned won in my book, because I think arguing with these guys for a long while could convince me away from Ned.   TL;DR: As a cosplay judge, I believe Ned deserved the win, BUT if my fellow judges argued and pushed me enough I could be convinced to give up my say to Eugene after like half an hour of arguing with fellow judges.
Am i the only one who thinks zach’s dress wasn’t that bad? Same for the other clothes he made lol
where can i get eugene's confessional shirt
did zach call the maid dress trend?
Loved all of them but Eugene dress is really giving me Wilhelmina vibes from Ugly Betty
I WANNA SEE THEM MAKE PLUSHIES
Okay look Zach. Tiktok teens are trying to make guys in skirts a normal thing again. One step at a time!
I love Neds design idea so much I knew Ned was secretly my alternative king
I always hope eugene is first but this one goes to ned, eugene looked good in the dress but the dress did look better than ned's
lauren literally hot glues everything instead of sewing... lmao not qualified to be there
Eugène KILLED it ! I wanna wear that dress!
So they're all just gonna pretend like social distancing isn't a thing? They held hand, had no masks on, everything was wrong
Don't have to wear a bra with a dress????  Yeah, not so much.
Why do I feel like Eugene was Hillary, Ned was Bernie, and the judges were superdelegates?
Ok Kelsey really brought this video to the next level lol
Dare I say, Concentrating Eugene in a white tee shirt and messy hair? Sexy.
20:26 when Zach said MooMoo i immediately thought of the Mamamoo fandom hehe
can y’all replace that “ding” sound with something else ): when i watch y’all’s videos when my dog is around, he freaks out and i have to change it☹️
Zack isn’t bad. I think if they add a belt to that dress. It will look good
WHAT did she say about the crack on the floor!? 😂 "I'm using the crack on the floor as my guide. That's what I said the first time...."  I swear she said smoked meth lol
Tbh I think ned should have won! I think he impressed the judges the most with his creativity to execution ratio
KPOP stans. Arise
I think Ned's dress was the most impressively constructed, but I'd wear both Eugene's and Kelsey's dresses before his.   Also please put Kelsey in more videos, she's great!
I really like the last one.  It has so many great features like sexiness in the back, how it drapes, and ability to change from one style to another.    Bravo!
honestly neds dress was better its just that eugiene had a better waist that made his dress look better- they shouldve gotten the same person to try on all the dresses
Ned literally made a fucking corset! holy shit! also let me just say that sailor look of ned is just *chefs kiss And damn he rocked that look  Zach’s dress is something mu granny would wear. And he looks hella cute in it!
Gosh I missed y’all. ❤️
22:45 seeing those shoulder muscles in the corset just awakened something in me
Kpop stans have risen. We will make your wish come true😌✌🏻
I love this. It reminds me of my costume construction class. Seam rippers were my friends
I love this video! Y’all are so creative and fun!
Please make it caption because I really want to watch a video but I do not understand what do they says in the video!!
I love Eugene, but he reminds me of all the people who seem to Ace a test without studying or even trying. Like, he's just lucky. I did love the dress and he killed it when he walked out. But I liked Ned's, too, because of all the effort he put into it and how creative it was.
I’m sorry Eugene but you look like an Alcoholic Nun 😭
The try guys make a baby onesie for baby Fulmer without instructions!!!
Hey Internet,  Can somebody awsome please start creating non-binary dresses! 2020 needs it! Eugene needs it! WE NEED IT!
I definitely agree with the sentiment that Ned should have won, but only if he made the dress bigger to match his frame more, or if he got a gal to try it out otherwise Eugene wins it for me
LOVE Eugene's shirt <3  I'd wear the Hell out of Ned's shirt <3 <3  Eugene won the fashion show, Ned won the dress making imo!
they all did so good wtf literally i loved them all
27:59 take it any way ya want it
kelsey's keith impression was amazing LMAO
honestly think ned won. went way more creative, pulled it off better, and honestly something my 90s ass would wear lol I think eugene just won because he knows how to model and rock a dress, but it was kind of poorly constructed around the bottom hem and zipper
I wanna see Jessica Lange in Eugene's dress.
Honestly Kelsey is hilarious and let’s replace Keith 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love Keith though
Next challenge. Hand sew everything
Ned, you did great. You’re the winner in my heart.
Why is this so long?
Ned was ROBBED.
Covid????
Me giving a sewing tip- when you measure yourself make sure you leave 5 inches of room!!(that’s why when Eugene tried to get the bottom of the skirt on it was too tight)
No KEITH? I almost closed the video right there lol
Honestly, Eugene and Ned were equal. I love them both but Eugene just looked better in my opinion
For a future without any instructions video can you make baby onesies for Ned's next child???  I love your videos.
Did kelsey say she smoked meth?!😶
9:04 Zach is so good at directing insta pics though!!
I've missed Kelsey. Kelsey is my favourite Try Guy
I would totally wear Neds dress, if the red plaid went up to the naval and more high rise instead of the unflattering low rise he totally would’ve came in first place.
Kelsey’s Keith impression at the end was so good, it actually took me aback.
At this point just give the win to Eugene
Ned should have won, he put so much more work into it and it actually looked finished! Eugene's hood seemed really lazy.
Why aren't closed captions available? Very disappointing.
I feel like I am legit the only one who liked Eugene's dress better than ned's 😬😬 like honestly I do love ned's dress and everything, but style wise I like Eugene's more
10:20 just look at Ned in the background 😂
I LOVE Eugene's dress, but Ned's ambition and craftmanship REALLY made this hard. I guess it came down to who wore it better...which will always be Eugene, lol. They should've at least tied!
Would love this again with Keith instead of the Jersey Shore/drunk acting chick.
Everybody seems mad that Ned didn't get first, but honestly, I would buy Eugene's dress as shown. The concept of Ned's was great though. I think it just needed some refinement that the time didn't allow
this video won’t play past the first 10 seconds.
Ned was so feeling himself in that dress and I stan. Loved Eugene's but Ned aced this one 200%
Ned was robbed
I don’t think Zach is on the right side of tiktok if he thinks guys in skirts and dresses Isn’t a big thing 🤣🤣
Eugene did amazing but Ned DESERVED this win, his looks so clean and well made not to mention that he made a literal corset? he had boning on his dress and it’s his first time ever making one and he didn’t even have any help or construction. For once Eugene shouldn’t have won🥲🥲
Ned was so robbed of this win
Kelsey is just obnoxious
NGL I would wear Ned's dress. I'd wear that all day.
Please please please do more videos with Kelsey she is so fun haha
Everyone freaking out : 👁👄👁  Ned: 💅🏽
ok but i n terms of construction, kelsey's dress 👎🏽
Ned's dress is so hot, DAMN!
No one: Litterally no one: Kelsey: "thats what i said the first time i smoked meth"
I  love Kelsey, please make more videos with her. Try Guy and Kelsey videos are a great combo for me.
zach said dudes in dresses, gen z said dudes in maid outfits
Don't get me wrong I love Keith, but Kelsey's energy was just ✨Immaculate✨
I would so buy Ned, Eugene, and Kelsey's dress!!!
i love seeing Kelsey and Eugene hanging out
Try Guys the New, Old, Buzzfeed...the better Buzzfeed...I am Home!
This is a Netflix show that I would watch tbh
Kelsey is so great in this video
Ned looks like blonde freddy mercury
NED WAS ROBBED
Ned was robbed
ngl, Zach's dress shape looked like it'd make a very good Lucy costume for You're a Good Man Charlie Brown. It had the space for the amount of movement needed for the part and looked very youthful. Just make it blue and puff the sleeves a bit.
10:25 HAHA NEDD
I wish Ned won honestly I preferred his!
Try guys dye,cut,style wigs !
Ik Ned was pissed😭😂
Tiktok: makes dudes in dresses a thing  ur welcome zack
Can I just say you all look amazing in this video? <3
Tbh Ned should have won, he just went out of his comfort zone and did a lot of risky moves. And just because Eugene looks objectively better in a dress doesn't mean he was supposed to win. I was impressed by Eugene but more so by Ned.
It's not just the ethnic grandmas that were rockin' the housedress/muumuu... My white southern mamaw wore a housedress everyday she wasn't going out. Bra optional. *shudders *
Ned!!! The details!!! I want that dress
Ayyyy big fan of Roman!!! Super glad to see he's back again :D
I actually disagree with the majority of the comments here. In my opinion Ned has the lesser dress, and I'd like to explain my reasoning  Shape: Ned's dress had less shape. Yes, you can account for part of that with figure differences, but bear in mind that Ned attempted to make a corset and so should have been able to achieve more shape. In fact you can even see in the back where his lacing was gaping because he didn't have enough boning to give him structure  Waist: that skirt waist location was really poorly chosen. It throws the whole balance of the garment off, which is really disappointing because of how much effort he put in. And using the taped on stud belt didn't help, in my opinion. The look would have pulled together better with a draped and angled belt  Neckline: he had a completely straight neck, no shaping, it was just folded over and taped down. He could have given it the sweetheart neckline he had in his design image!  Too many textures: I might be disagreeing with the majority here but I felt that Ned had too many textures in his. He overdid the writing and it just made it too busy. If he'd used a fabric that had a base texture it would have worked better, or perhaps done a black lace overlay for texture. But the writing didn't add to it  Raw edges: the skirt didn't look intentionally designed with the raw edges, it just looked more slapdash. I think the raw look would have gone better if he'd used a more jagged cut. Or if he'd gone through with the pleats!   Whereas for Eugene's  Colour: I actually liked the monochromatic look, the only thing I would have changed would be to use a fabric with more texture, or maybe even decorative embroidery to highlight areas  Shape: Eugene's fit him better and that's a fact. Yes, like 1 or 2 tiny spots didn't sit perfectly, but he actually had his waist sit at the right height, and the draping on the shoulders was well executed. Same with his neckline, the tapering suited his shape better  Texture: I disagreed with the judges when they said Eugene's needed more texture, and it clearly shows the judges weren't considering a historical fashion basis which is what Eugene was going for in his design. I think embellishments would have detracted from the look. Maybe some pearls or broaches, but nothing more in my opinion  Construction: Eugene's the only one who didn't cop out and use adhesives  Eugene had the better overall garment. Ned did AMAZING and I would love to see Ned remake his piece with more time, with help from a seamstress, and putting it on different models. It would look STUNNING! But for the purposes of this competition Eugene did pull ahead when push came to shove, and that's the truth  But Ned PLEASE DON'T BE DISCOURAGED! That was a really close call and honestly just a few tweaks would have really pulled it over the line. I actually think Ned could really have a solid crack at fashion design, and I would love to see a video of him and Eugene designing a series of outfits together! They both have developed keen eyes for it
I adore how Zach was such a photographer for Kelsey, literally amazing.
Ned did not come to play with you heauxs....he came to slay!
Ned was completely robbed. His was so detailed and thought out and ambitious!
25:41 Ned being told to sit this way so we don’t see his balls...
When Eugene puts the hood up all I thought was “Oh my goooood I’m the clitoris”
I think they should've given it to Ned and I think Eugene felt that Ned should've won as well cause he wasn't so pumped about this win.
Yay Roman is back!!!
why does Eugene is serving veronica lodge walking into pops for the first time
As someone who has made a dress WITH instructions.... idk they did even this
Everyone saying Ned's dress was better but nobody thinking how creative it is to add an effing hoodie to a dress and making it work. I like Ned's dress but it's a bit bland.
Zach should have won 😞
uhhhh why does ned look like an 80s gay.....i love the look but pack it up the village people
Wow... Just wow... 👏 👏 👏
They should put bestdressed as a judge
How has no-one else commented on Kelsey's meth joke at 8:45 🤣
Okay is no one else going to talk about how FUCKING ASTONISHING KELSEY WAS!?!?!?!?  Not only her her Kieth impressions just- UHHH FLAWLESS!??!!?  But fucking did such an amazing job with her dress AND brought such lovely energy that meshed so well with all the other Try Guys! OML. OUTSTANDING. *applause*
I wanted to comment on being surprised Ned didn't win, but I see I'm not the only one!
Ned definitely won
Ned was robbed. Zach deserved better. Kelsy is amazing and so funny
Dude the hair on that woman's legs is repulsive...
I request that Kelsey not replace Keith but is added as a try gal
I feel like I missed it, why isn’t Keith there?
: and thats how they went gay
Kelsey and Ned: *Having a photoshoot* Eugene: *struggling*
ust because Eugene looks better in a dress doesnt mean his dress was best.  I said what I said (2) Ned did so much better.
Did Eugene make his gloves? I feel like it's a little unfair to use things you didn't make. I think it should have been Ned wins  Zach  Eugene  Keith's replacement I love Eugene i do but i think this was unfair and it shouldn't be who looks best but who's looks the best and works. Like Keith's girl is gonna have to cut her dress off she should have been last
As a k-pop stan and a raging bisexual let me tell you I've been at the forefront of the battle to get dudes into dresses for years.. it's not happening idk why😭😭
Eugene walking into The Handmaid's Tale like: 24:36
am i the only one that went to kelseys ig to see what the picture looked like lol
I would like to see Kelsey in the purple dress
Zach, Male kpop idols have already done a lot of dressing in skirts/ dresses, but it will only work if people would stop hating on kpop, sooo... That will be your job. to spread the word that kpop is good. And not trashy or stupid like some people think, not all though
It only took a moustache for Ned to go from Ned Fulmer to Ned Flanders.
ned should have won!!!! his is so amazing and creative and well made and it made me super happy to watch him do it
I liked old Keith better
zack looks like my filipion aunti who has her hair in giant clips and is always telling me how fat ive gotten
Kelsey is funny, but I wish she would’ve taken it a little more seriously.... she honestly just seemed kinda drunk or high...:
I want to know what Eugenes mom would say about the dress! She helped inspire it!
Keith would make a cinnamon raisin dress. No doubt.
men in skirts/dresses >>>
I love kelsey like i just want to be friends with her
13:45 Zach made a whole pillowcase HAHAHHA
NED FUCKING WON
i have never loved zack so much in a video
as someone who was once a beginner sewist, when Ned said he was gonna do pleats, I just went 0-0
I loved everyone's dresses and the judges said it was hard to choose. Let's show all of them love ❤️
Why is Kelsey the real life version of Nickels from Orange is the New Black 😂
I enjoyed watching this video. This was better then when you did your last sewing project. I hope you will do more of these in the future.
Eugene’s dress reminds me of the electric plug girl from Stardust Crusaders
I didn't remember who Kelsey was, then I re watched "Eugene Drinks Every States Iconic Cocktail" and it all came back lol.
i don't see a lot of people saying this so i just wanted to pipe in and say that kelsey was HILARIOUS in this. she was constantly making me laugh and i really enjoyed her dynamic with the rest of the guys.
Eugene is Zachs enabler
kelsey: zach will you take an instagram with me? zach: yeah girl :p
Now I want to see Eugene and Ned's dresses made by someone with time and experience. Seeing those as full-fledged moments would be ICONIC.
I feel like Kelsey didn’t take this seriously
I am a huge lesbian but goddamn Ned be lookin fine
der not mum of bride dess... that dress is so cool
Fkyes loved them all
Dudes in dresses >>>
Zak taking photos is the type of photo friend we all need in life
NED WON in my books 😌😌😌😌
Wow, Ned brought it, I'm honestly impressed
Was Keith rrreeeaaaally missing? She’s like his twin
Have you ever noticed that the people that design and make clothes  always dress the worst
Love Eugene’s dress, however, Ned is the winner in my heart!! He should’ve won 👑
I'm so glad to see Kelsey back in the try guys videos ive missed her too much 🤣😭
Neds' dress was the best!
“tiktok and kpop stans, make it happen, make guys in dresses a thing.”   Zach we’ve been trYING
Kelsey does anything and I’m cracking up
With is Ned dressed like a ginger Freddie Mercury?
I think they should ass a survey at the end of these so we can vote CAUSE THIS TIME I WANTED NED TO WIN
This video has big Cosplayer 24 Hours Before a Con energy.
With his stash and something about the dress really gives Ned some leather daddy vibes lol
the comment section makes me so happy knowing that most people agree that ned should have won. i’m so proud of him. i hope he knows we would have given him the win.
Zack at 13:14 oh sweetie we weebs already did. Have you not seen the guys in maid dresses trend yet? Lmao
Kelsey pulled a full Micarah Tewers by gluing herself into the dress
Can’t wait to see Neds children see their fun loving father in a fabulous dress.
Omg I love Kelsey
NED GOT ROBBED
I'm as white as can be and my grandma had housedresses!
That judge in the black has some hairy legs 😳
Please NEVER replace Keith or any of the other try guys with her again
I would totally make Eugene's dress...
Ned killed it. 100%. Way to go dude. I know this is outside your comfort zone. I'm so proud of you, buddy.
I think Ned was robbed!!! His had so much more technique and he put so much detail and energy into the dress.
We need a Try Guys vs Try Wives already!
Ned should've won this one, his dress was so much better.
Kelsey may have been standing in for keith but she did it well with the small blue squares
I wanted this... Requested it when they wanted to make pants.
NED WALKED OUT LIKE SHAYNE TOPP AND IM WHEEZING
Ned with a mustache is doing things to me.
i bout died when zach sewed the arms shut lmaoooo
As much as I love Eugene's dress, I think Ned was robbed! He did freaking boning AND a corset! Come on!
Zack really got a bad hair transplant didn't he
"Every bitch loves a sundress." TRUTH
Eugene’s dress is amazing!!! I’d buy it!
Zack not realising gender doesn’t have gender 👁👄👁
Well, I can't look at Kelsey because I'm too overcome with jealousy. I have issues :(
here's my prediction: eugene's is gonna look good, even if he doesn't try.
Zack : Tik tok Teens you have the power to make everything happen ! make men in dresses happen!  me:.........who's going to tell him about the maid outfit?
When can your Deaf and HOH viewers such as myself expect closed captions for this video please? I've been enjoying your Sewing without Instructions series and this one I really want to be able to understand what you are saying. Thank you for your consideration.
Can the try guys do the IGCSE? I wanna see how much we suffer
For some reason when zack placed his "dress" in the maniquin thing it somewhat reminded me of a chinese dress, of course not paying attention of the cloth design, and i somewhat would have liked if he made a chinese dress.
Really really!!! For me bed is the winner
Is kelsey High?
i'm sorry, but ned should've won. 100%.
Kelsey looks looks so pretty! She's like glowing💗 Face on 10. Body on 10. That jumpsuit is also pretty cute
There is a try girl?
TRY GUYS COLOR/CUT HAIR WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS
wow I’m so shocked at how good these dresses came out, neds thooooo, would totally wear 🥰
anyone else feel like ned should have won?
Please have closed captions/subtitles in your videos. I was super excited to watch the video but was bummed out when there was none. The most recent video had closed captioning, but it was missing few words and context. Accessibility for the win!
Very sad to see that captions aren’t available
Ok now I want a cape/hood dress
Dit is letterlijk de K3 film over die modeshow
NED SHOULD'VE WON THOOOO
you know when zach was holding his dress up at 13:37 i was thinking "i wonder what he's going to do with the sleeves, will he cut them open? how intriguing" and then he wiggled his arms in and froze and it was the first time it occurred to me that maybe the sack sleeves were not part of the plan
I feel like Zack would be ecstatic to know that men in skirts already is a thing on tiktok
I can’t believe we had to sit here and witness Ned being robbed like this... A whole crime.
I really love that mustache
Ned I 1000% would wear this dress! I literally want it now. Like not 2009, but NOW. It's amazing! You rock!
Watching Ned progress through these videos is just insane. I'm SO proud of him. Like. What!? Look at dress. It's amazing. Great job Ned!
Kelsey’s dress the best period. I would pay for it.
Immediately after seeing everyones end procuct and before seeing the results I'd just like to say Ned absolutely deserves the win his was SO well put together.
Kelsey: Those soft dolls with the flannel dresses you get when you're a small child and female. Zach: Older woman in your family when they're in the house. Ned: 14 year old punk kid was given the opportunity to make their own clothes. Eugene: V cool formal lady who may or may not actually be an assassin, or just gets cold easy.
Why is Eugene always 1st or last lmfao 🤣
Pls add cc
Chelsea! Bring her back for something else!
13:11 we were already on it Zach.   EVERYONE HOP IN WERE HEADING TO FEMBOY HOOTERS
NED WAS ROOOOOOOOBBED
Nah man, give Ned that win 100%
I want zack to win one of these! I’m also loving the growth of Eugene. He’s starting to tap into his caring and sensitive side!
I'm gonna just say it. Ned should have won.
Okay is there a legit version of Kelsey's dress out there cause I HAVE TO HAVE IT
ned's mustache reminds me of howard stark.
Ned was ROBBED. The print pattern!!!! The corset!!!   The construction!!! My face hurt so much I was smiling so hard. He was working it!!!
I’m sorry, Ned killed that!
Ned said anarchy boobs
Micarah Tewers should've been a judge.
NED WAS ROBBED
Recalled by the people- Ned is the true winner. Both dresses are amazing—- actually out of all your makes with out videos this one is by far the closest cuz I would wear every single one of those dresses. But Neds was just done well all together! I think the only thing I want to see on  Ned is a halter top to it. Mostly cuz it’s all very boxy feeling and to help maybe give him an attempt to a hour glass or even pear shape look with a halter would be nice. But I feel like for how simple Eugenes is he should of have time to make his edges cleaner. They seem just a bit unkempt. Ned literal did way more down to personal graffiti on the whole top! Ned was robbed!!!!
Zach is like the best guy to go out with
Anyone else watching this after guys in skirts and guys in maid dresses blew up.......
Yass Ned!
Ned should have won
Zach being Kelseys photographer was arguably the best part of the video 🥰
Ned got so robbed 😔 Eugene did so well but neds was so out of the box and just so unique 😔
Zack: dudes in dresses, make it the next thing me: I mean, we've got men in skirts and maid dresses, we're already basically there
I LOOVE neds sm I would buy it
I'm only 2 minutes in, three hours is a fuckin short time to make a dress, I made a frog hat in 5 hours like damn that's a short amount of time for a dress
ned was robbed!
Ned put so much into his dress, tried so many new concepts (boning, corset back, etc), captured the style really well, and overall just put his heart and soul into it. I do love Eugene’s, I love how versatile it is and how he took the time to do the hems and everything, but I’m behind Ned on this one. He was so bummed ):
Ned really did put in some effort and we also didn't get to see Eugenes dress with the hood down. The amount of detail and appreciation that went into neds dress vs a "send it" attitude, I have nothing against it Eugenes unique style but watching the care that went into neds dress makes me want to get it on the spot.
I really do want to see Zach in more dresses, they look great on him
Does anyone else come to watch these videos, just to see Eugene win, but act like we don't see it coming still? LOL
Ned was robbed!
I absolutely love Eugene’s dress, but I’m team Ned
KELSEY I NEED YOU ALL THE TIME YOU'RE A GENIUS
Last time I made a dress I was probably 6-years-old and made it out of paper for my Barbie. For some reason all my Ken and Barbie dolls ended up naked so I made them clothes.
Why does Zach feel the need to make snarky comments while the judges talk? I don't understand. It comes off very rude.   "Hmmm wow, so we all blew him away."
ps i dont want to be that person but ithink that it is a tie beetween ned and eugene sorry
That chick is hella annoying.
I dont care what anyone says, Eugene 100% deserved to win. Literally drop dead gorgeous look. It is so him.
Who is Kelsey, where is Keith, and why is no one wearing masks or social distancing?
Justice For Ned, his looked like something you’d see at a store
27:59 just play that audio in front of your parents like you’re watching something and see their reaction
Eugene's dress here,,, was Mother of the Bride who pegged the groom.
Ned looks like Coran from Voltron
Zach's like. Hunni, I ain't winnin' it but   I will lose with grace🤣🤣🤣💚
I love kelsey so much shes so funny
Just saying kpop idols already do wear dresses and crop tops cause they are not scared to show there "feminine side" :)
we stan for ned he is one of my favorite straught people he doesnt like stand there and try to make a dress and he comes out of his comfert zone to break heteronormativity and thats great i love that
they cheated zack, zack should have won he was not bad as they made it seem his was great
Eugenes dress is like what people would say is really cool but neds is what they would actually wear in real life
The fact Eugene looks better than me in a dress pisses me off but in the best way possible we Stan🧡
Oh wow, please, minute 22:44 ... I know he's married, but my. You're a ginger vision, Ned.
Ned gave me tiger king vibes this episode and I don’t like it
Ned was robbed
She did a great job at impersonating Keith 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Fuck it Ned I’ll fucking wear the dress 🥺 he got robbed cuz he did so well and went out of his comfort zone and I love the dress so much 😭
Okay the try guys make Asian food and Eugene is one of the judges
ned was robbed
Honestly I’d slap a cardigan on and wear kelsi’s dress any day
I really liked Kelsey! She has a great energy!
Ned was ROBBED
That cloak though. We need to make that a thing again. Put cloaks on everything.
Yassss, Ned!
I love all of them honestly. All of their outfits are cute and match their personalities ☺️ But I would choose Ned as the winner!
Where be Keith?
Loved Eugene's dress but Ned made a CORSET, he should have won 😭
Ned should’ve won. Period.
I need the pattern for Eugene’s dress.
What the hell happened to her?? She looks like Joan Rivers now. Slow down on the Botox and filler! Jeez!!!
I can't believe Ned didn't make more boning jokes.
Ned was robbed! NOOOOO
21:53 dude sameee 🤣
Kelsey  dress is actually super cute
16:21 🤣😙 factsss And a mood
Ned and his dress is my favourite try guys moment
13:14 lol so who’s gonna send this to them
8:33 😂
ned made a corset!?!?!?!? and he didn’t win? anyways, love you eugene but ned did that
Zack: I'm gonna cut out a stencil out of paper, it's probably wrong but idk I'm doing it.  Me: well the video I watched of a village person teaching her daughter to make dresses did the exact same thing so Zack may have a shot at this one!
I'm kind of glad we didn't get a "daddy's favorite" dress cause I feel like that woulda got dark rq
I wish Kelsey hadn’t done so much work to her face she was already beautiful 🥰 but if it makes her happy then that’s what matters 🤷🏼‍♀️
Ned deserved to win
Honestly I dislike Kelsey anddd also I disagree v strongly with the comment that her dress was goth... It's a blue and white?? Sundress?? Nothing goth about that??
Zac unconsciously sow a pillow 🤣
Ned was fucking ROBBED
I agree with Eugene winning, only because I could recreate Ned's dress, but I wouldn't be able to recreate Eugene's.  Props to both guys though!!!
Yo Ned should have definitely won, he was robbed.
Eugene: *Is sexist AF* Oh it's ok cause he's gay.
I love Ned's dress. He made a corset . I think that alone should have got him the win.
Zack's dress looks like my grandma's nightgown
They all look so good in their dresses
Before making the skirt of the dress. Fokus on the top. Skirts goes faster to cut and sew than shirts.
Kelsey looks SO GOOD in this wow
Who gave this man a hammer and  nails lol
Dress that you can sleep in, party in and Pee in... that’s the dream, girl!
Also how come Keith wasn’t in the video?
Kelseys dress was amazing she was robbed
My Style Scoring: 1) Eugene 2) Ned 3) Zach 4) Kelsey  Comfort Rating: 1) ZACH 2) Eugene 3) Kelsey 4) Ned
Where’s Keith?
Zach looks like Olive Oyl lol
Me at 13:19 where are Ned’s pants
Nice mustache ned
This was biased af
Just saying, with a little tweaking and shaping, I would totally wear Zach's dress. The aesthetic and style that he's going for is totally my jam.
I related so hard when Zach sewed the sleeves on accident. I've made similar mistakes.
Ned was robbed
The way Eugene got so excited about Ned's corset and pointed to it was so cute 🥺 11:43
13:09 why do I feel like kpop is getting mentioned every where right now
Did I just see Ned use a hammer lol my eye my eyes
Zach: dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing Trending on tiktok: men in maid outfits Guys it was all because of zach
I’m ethnic. I  wear a house dress.  Fully not a nana 😂😂
Everyone already said it but Ned definitely should have won. :/ I think Eugene only won here because he's hot and knows how to model a dress already. Like Eugene definitely should have gotten second place but his dress was nowhere near Ned's level.
As a seamstress this is pretty impressive for 3 hours
This is a petition for Zach to take part in  femboy Friday on tiktok
Please make a non-binary fashion line!!! Thank you!!!
Eugene won this hands down honestly. I want 😍 and the colour choice 🙌🙌👌
I need to sew me a Eugene’s dress 😱😱❤️
zach, dudes in dresses are already the next hot thing (well, skirts at least?? i cant recall exactly)
the "don't worry about it " was so honest and funny
Ned was snubbed
i dont agree whatsoever. neds was much closer to his vision of what he wanted to do in the beginning. Eugene's was just what he came out with in the spot. For me it was 1.-Ned, 2.- Kelsey, 3.-eugene, 4.- zac
Zach made a pillow case🤣
I’m convinced that Eugene is god
"Do measure things" Micarah Tewers watchers... "By chicken lengths...?"
Kelsey reminds me of Miley Cyrus
Zach's dress is my grandma's sleeping attire hahaha
We all know that popular vote is the winner, so congrats Ned!
ned should have won, eugenes was drapy and shit but really poorly constructed and neds had IT ALLLLLL
If Ned doesnt win i'm gonna be MAD
I WANT the dress Eugene made so bad!!!
Kelsey picking blue & white squares was the Keith choice
Why are there many zaps at Zack? it's not funny.
Love this! I would love to see more sewing videos. Like themed clothing. It made me want to see again. I used to sew baby blankets for family and friends. In school I made a tote bag and a baby blanket as well as toys with the remaining fabric. I’d love to try sewing clothing sometime. I no longer have my sewing machine so that would need to be bought. Keep up the videos guys! You all we’re quite creative :)
I cannot believe Kelsey didn’t place higher, her’s is hands down my favorite by a lot
Ned shoulve won
This was a hard one for me.  Eugene’s style and cut was so nice. It was creative and very figure flattering. Absolutely gorgeous.  Ned’s was so creative. He probably put in the most effort by having to make his own corset. His was also the most complete with finished hems and edges.  I think the deciding factor was simply design. I love Ned’s creativity but his design was little tacky and outdated for 2020. Sorry.  Eugene’s design was classic, but also modern (with the open back and hood), his is a dress that anyone would 100% wear in 2020. It’s a stunning design.  Honestly, it’s super duper hard to decide between the two.
I would wear Eugenes dress right now.
Kelsey: What kind of dress would Keith make? Me: Daddy’s favorite
I MISSED HER
Watching you guys trying so many new things, without caring about what people will think or say give me a lot of courage to be more experimental in life :)
As the majority of people have said, yes Ned was robbed. Eugene’s was nice and he pulled it off well, but Ned’s really showed a lot of heart and soul in it.
Zach's dress reminds me to the typical dress every Spanish grandma wears when they're home 😂😂😂
Ned was robbed!!!!!
*Where is daddy’s favourite?*
This reminds me of last election... everyone voted for Hillary but trump won.. no offense Eugene
if olive oyl (Popeyes girl) went on vacation.. zach’s dress would be it 😂😂
Ned won in my book. I didn’t have to watch till the end to know he didn’t win but I think he definitely deserves it
1:45 Kelsey's impression of Keith just kills me!! I keep rewinding and watch it again and again lmaoo xD
Whenever they do these without instructions competitions we all know eugene is going to win Hes just good at everything even when he doesnt know what hes doing lol
I am in love with Eugene’s dress.
22:44 bro ned has good arms and shoulders
whoohoo project runway!! and try guys ! whoohoo
Y’all are gassing up neds dress too much 😂
I wanted to see Kelsey in Eugene’s dress 😢
I identify with Kelsey
I'm watching them as I'm crocheting a top and envying how fast they can make a whole dress
I think Eugene's is more wearable but that's not a condition. It's creativity, construction, and is it a dress. I think Eugene's was a bit better constructed, but not overly creative. Yeah if course the hood is creative but over all it's a little plain. Ned was more creative and went out of his comfort zone, and it was still pretty well constructed. Ned should've one. Definitely a Eugene #2 though. (Eugene, and everyone, still did an amazing job, Ned is just my pick.)
What if try guys try to do army training??? Like For a week.... Hmmmmm
Eugene did great....but Ned should have won. This is like the ONLY time I have disagreed. Lol
Ned's thighssss xD BLINDING. but me too me too
Ok I would wear Eugene’s I love it
I'd love to see Eugene do a series where he learns how to sew
“If Zach wins” what a bizarre statement in general
26:08
Okay bc neds mustache isn’t bad
I love Kelsey. Can we replace Keith with her permanently?
not sure why they didn't just make t-shirt dresses... literally they're so easy to make they made it so hard on themselves
This is so amazing!!!! Love this!!!!
captions?
They were too hard on Kelsey. Her dress was absolutely gorgeous and so unbelievably creative. If it were constructed properly, I would buy it in an instant. So beautiful. And I'm sorry, but Eugene's was monochromatic, and there's the fact that he only changed it at the last minute because of Kelsey. It would've been a much less interesting dress without the shawl/hood. Ned deserved first all the way. Unbelievably creative and beautifully constructed with the boning and corset. He was robbed.
As a K-pop stan, I would be honored to help make dudes in dresses a thing.
Oh so Ned’s a crip
I like Neds whole Freddy Mercury thing goin on
Eugene slay!!!!!!! Anyone else ready to wear that bad boy?! So gorgeous
I know it's become the "thing" that Eugene always wins, but Ned was absolutely robbed!!
Does anyone know where Kelsey's jumpsuit is from? I've been looking for days and I can't find it anywhere!
Love the "sexy like my mom" part 😂
Me being a sewer and feeling like I’m being babied when they explain how to sew: bruh I’m not five, I’m in my four year of sewing class, at age 12 too as well
i want to buy neds dress
I feel like @blogilates used this studio for her wedding workouts 🤣
I would like more Kelsey please and thank you
Lol kelsey’s impression of Keith was on point! Surprised everyone was actually able to make some sort of dress! Love this series
zach, we already have male idols in both skirts and dresses what more do you want from us kpop stans
I want to see Eugene's dress on kelsey, and Ned's dress on Eugene. As a designer, I cant even teach people to sew what Ned did in three hours with no instruction. I'm so impressed with what he pulled together.
dudes in skirts and maids dresses are already the next big thing, zach
zach: whatever i do i’m going to say it was intentional.. me: OMG SAME my costume design teacher will never know 😈
Something no one else is talking about Kelsey, while she didn't sew it properly at all, had such an amazing design. I feel like if I can find similar fabrics, I want to recreate her dress with wearability
Nah Ned should have won tbh, tho I’m sure he was second. He easily had the most complicated construction and creativity in that regard, where as eugenes - while I liked the design - lacked anything to make it pop beyond the hood. Just my opinion tho /:
I fucking love Kelsey !!
I'm starting to wonder about Ned's sexuality
Ok guys, writing before seeing who won and without reading comments, first of all, all of you, Kelsey included, f-ed it in a really amazing way (I don't mean it like I don't like it, but it's a ginourmus amount of chaos and misfits and passion that there's no way I could be mad at any of you). Second, and in this point sadly I can't include Kelsey for obvious reasons, you just showed men in dresses can look good, it's not only the dress, but the energy you projected while presenting it, and I'm pretty sure giving the design to a profesional and wearing them again you totally leave the Gucci one in shame. And finally, in my opinion Ned totally won.
We all agree Ned should've won by F A R, but can we just appreciate how naturally good Zach looks in his dress?
"it's hard to find a lot of non-binary clothing" god that's such a mood, Eugene
nah Ned was robbed
NED WAS ROBBED. NED SHOULD'VE WON
Honestly, all the dresses look pretty damn fine at first glance. I'd have given Ned the win for creativity and effort, but Eugene's dress is my personal favourite. I want a dress like that, dang it
Ned in that dress is making me feel some type a way ngl
“Mother of the bride, but she f*cks.”
I’m using the crack on the floor as my guide.   That’s the same thing I said the first time I smoked. 😂😂
Did Kelsey have some plastic surgery?
Just because Eugene looks better in a dress doesnt mean his dress was best.  I said what I said.
Zac literally made the Moroccan pajama
Wow. Kelsey actually wasn't annoying.
I want professional remakes of these dresses so I can buy all of them. Make them into merch, idk, gimme!
I'm actually in love with Kelsey's dress look
Eugene: “Ugh I didn’t mean it to be sweet” 😂😂😂
you can't expect me to not be pan when there's girls on tictok wearing sundresses spinning in the sun lip singing to girls in red like wha-
I would not have wanted to have to choose between Ned's and Eugene's. They were both awesome. Draping and adding boning are both very difficult. I'm pretty sure it came down to Ned using tape to finish the belt as why he lost. Otherwise, I think he'd have won.
Kelsey's Keith impression when she lost was perfection
Zack's dress is a mess no doubt but it's actually really cute... like total Model Child vibes!!
I love Kelsey 😌✌
they need to man up
I havent gotten to the winner reveal yet but if they dont pick ned their just wrong. Ned wins hands down. Love Eugene's concept but I think the execution leaves something to be desired. Neds is a whole outfit, so many details, so much ambition, done very well. He deserves to win! Edit: NED WAS ROBBED!!! Look at the comments ned because we are with you and you were fucking robbed. Edit edit: I should also say that I love the concept of Eugene's dress and he did very well with the time and what he had, I just think it was clear that ned won.
make guys in dresses hot 2020
Zach's looks like something a grandma would wear
NED'S WAS SO MUCH BETTER!!!
13:13 We're trying Zach, trust me (skirts are starting to gain traction idk how long dresses will take) But u know what, go be a trend setter, make ur own dresses and don't care what others think! Wear whatev u want!
NED WAS ROBBED. HE WAS ROBBED. IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. SO MUCH EFFORT, I LOVE IT
I just need yall to out these dresses (and pants) for auction so I can see other people in them lol
Thanks Eugene for your comment! My grandma did wear a dress around the house like the one Zack made
Yes! Kpop stans should have men wear dresses more often
I would so buy Eugene's dress, but I feel like Ned was robbed. He went so out of his comfort zone and gave 110%. Kudos, Ned.
Eugene's dress took my breath away, honestly. I know Ned put a lot of effort in his dress and I loved the way it looked, but fashion-wise, Eugene's was next level.
I LOVE how Zach didn’t just take a couple pictures for Kelsey, he guided her poses and worked with angles 😂😂
Super fun episode, but I agree with a lot of the other commenters here: Ned’s dress was the winner. Eugene’s was lovely but Ned’s was so creative and had a myriad of elements to it. He looked freaking great in it too! 😎
So hear me out... the word "guys" is ambiguous, right?  Here to for... can Kelsey be a member of the Try Guys??????  Please!?!?  She adds something.  Maybe a v card, but it seems to me to be a bit more without taking away from the original crew.
Kelsy: "If Zach wins then the patriarchy wins." Zack: "lol don't even worry about it"
I guess I'm not a bitch since I don't like wearing sundresses. 😢
Eugenes is my favorite followed very closely by Neds.  I do like the summer dress she was going for.  But like finished
Eugene deserved the win.
Y'know what? I can totally envision Meds dress being sold at Forever 21 like 10 years ago. No joke
Kelsey is literally the woman of my dreams.
Ned.  I understand you have a mustache, but there is a different between a good one and a bad one, and that’s a bad one
They all did so well !! Ned’s dress is just so ugly though ahahah, Eugene is just waaaaay too good at everything 😮 Love Kelsey’s design but the hot glue .. lol, actually liked Zac’s !! edgy
Nobody: Ned: SHE-FON
Eugene for Drag race 👀
Ned needs to lose the porn stash lol
I would definitely get Eugene’s dress. Hands down🙌, I like the other three and their dresses. Especially Ned’s dress, but I like cape-like flowy dress Eugene had created.
Boo, what the fuck. Ned had that. He did amazing and his was so much more interesting and nicer to look at than Eugene’s. No shade to Eugene either, Ned just did great.
Ned was robbed
if need dress was high waisted BARK BARK BARK
I honestly love Kelsey's dress. I thought it was super cute.
eugene giving me descendants vibes  zack giving me granny vibes  kelsey giving me tumbler vibes  ned giving me X factor 2013 auditions
try guys make swimsuits without instructions. or for a more wintery feel, coats or gloves
Please don't haver Kelsey on ever again.... the unprofessionalism... in a try guys video of all things
kelsey is so pretty i Am not crying you are
Zack - who you want taking photos for you  Zack: "arm down.. look off to Ned.. angry, like someone stole your lunch .. too angry, you don't want them to know you're upset" vs. Kelsey: "123.. do something different with your hand, it's creepy"
Hmmm.... not a fan of the stache Ned 😂
zach looks like a grandma
Why without subs ? guys ?)
zach!! dudes in dresses is already popular among the teens. they look gorgeous. i am crying
No! I love Eugene but Ned deserved that win
Ned low key looks like he would kidnap fifty children and not get caught
Eugene’s dress is classic and beautiful- but Ned’s was so creative and fun and pulled off corsetry!
I love Kelsey
I'm sorry but, the CORRECT ranking is: 1. Ned, obviously 2. Zach 3.Eugene 4.Kelsey PERIOD
Not surprised Eugene won. He my fucking winner! I would take Eugene’s drapey hood; Ned’s rebellious-style on his dress; Kelsey’s “attempted” pocket and slits; and Zach’s V-neck, then combine the styles for my ultimate bad girl look. With some weapons, of course.🐅🖤🐞🕶
Ned should've won
I feel like Kelsey should have been second like no hate to ned bc I loved his dress but Kelsey’s I feel like was better
kelsey is so foul and not even funny
Ned deserved this one. Yes Eugene's dress was flattering but where's the adventurous flavor? As a hobby seamstress, I would cry trying to make a corset without instruction!
Ned did have functional lacing, but I think he was probably docked a few points for construction because of the gaping it had. I really wish they had released their points breakdown with this one.
everyone talking about how ned was robbed but what about KELSEY her dress was beyond good, it was great ! I loved it i would have put kelsey in first, ned in second, eugene in third, and zack in last
I would not care to see Kelsey in another video
Kelsey played this psycho actress character in LOVE on netflix and I absolutely LOVED her character.
Need me some Keith
Does he not know about the femboys of alt tiktok...?
I think Eugene was the rightful winner. Ned's corset was very well done, but overall, Eugene's dress had more structure, purpose and a finished look to it. Eugene's dress was the most ready to hang on a retail shop
Thought Eugene looked better sans wig... Elegant in a lovely colour, and I do like the cape/shawl. But honestly, while it isn't my style, Ned should have won. Fucking impressive construction! On a personal level, I would wear Kelsey's dress, if there were actual pockets, and the third fabric at the back wasn't there. But I thought it was super cute. And Zach!! It hurt when you automatically dismissed your chance at winning! That was a fun fabric, I liked the shape and the neckline! Your seams were an accident, but you rocked it anyway! Have more confidence in your skills buddy!
Zack, you don't know how badly i want to see my kpop boys in dresses.
im sorry but that girl is really annoying... bring keith back pleeeease
KPOP STANDS, WEVE BEEN CALLED, GOOOOOOOOOO
Eugene needs to work with a designer to make that dress a reality (beyond the show) because I want one!
It's like RPDR with less steps.
Why is Ned giving me Mario vibes???
*laughs in Micarah Tewers*
I love all the dresses!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
NED SHOULD HAVE WON
First time I liked someone else's creative work more than Eugene's Love from India
The creativity in Ned's dress oh my god
ned was ROBBED
I think Ned deserved to win this....... How can they not take a corset made by someone for the very first time into consideration?! I Loved Eugene's but Ned should've been the winner...
Ned deserved this win...
Kelsey: Zach will u come take an Instagram of me? Zach: yeah girl--ok arm down...ok look off to ned...oh yeahh *later* Kelsey now takin pics of zach : oh yeah...do something diff with your hand...  i love them 😂
ned was creative but it's not a look people would wear at this time idk, eugene's dress was elegant, versatil, has a back moment, the hood omg i love it, well deserved
ned was absolutely robbed.
Anyone can answer this but have the tryguys gotten into drag with a famous drag queen or king?
Ned won for me!!!!!
As a GCSE textiles student this pained me on a spiritual level
i totally now want a pattern for eugene's dress. i love it
I can't remember who's comment I'm stealing but I can't see it anymore, so here we go.  Keith: chicken sauce & burger sauce Ned: baby podcast Zach: tea conpany Eugene: we're just waiting for your androgynous clothing line at this point
OH MY FING GOD NED!! He really outdid himself and made a dress I would love to wear. It's so creative, so unique and so well done!!!! Damnnn
Director: ok so yall are doing a “ making a dress without a direction”   Ned: ezcusi? Ar hwi zoing a fasion epausode?
Can we please talk about Ned serving mean gay energy with this moustache and the hanky? And the butt thing? Tom of Finland would be proud.
Nobody: Absolutely not one person: Zak:.... So this is a meme...
I can’t believe Ned didn’t win! He made a fucking corset!!!
Everybody saying Ned should’ve won but Eugene’s dress is to die for.
Eugene, I love you but Ned is the people's winner here!!!
I just want it on record that my like is for the joke at 6:29
Eugene’s dress is gorgeous but the way Ned’s walking in that dress and everything just CAPTURES me completely dude. Like He could be walking for Alexander McQueen or sth.
I think they should make a show like the impractical jokers
Zach: "Dudes in dresses. Make it the next hot thing."  In kpop, it's already a thing :)
nah that was neds
I’m sorry but Kelsey was just super cringe😬😭  (I’m not being mean) Lol (Just honest)
im not even joking, id wear neds dress
did Kelsey just say she smoked meth??
eugene's dress is screaming Handler to me
Needs dress is cute af
Say someting Keith-like.  Me: Daddy’s favorit.
Zach's dress looks like a duster my grandma has. I think that's what eugene was talking about.
Ok but Zach taking her photos🥺 and he took more than one 💖💖💖
Zachs dress looks like smthn my grandma would buy me
imo eugenes and neds dresses are both equally good, just a shame they had to decide who gets first place. both had the same amount of flaws and were both aesthetically pleasing.
Did anyone's heart melt when they did a photoshoot and ned was like "Yeah sis"
I just love how Zac went "tik tok teens or even kpop stans, you can do anything, make dresses the next hot thing." Like he knows our power lmao
Eugene sewed in a zipper and hemmed the bottom, created a cape hood and gave the dress movement. Ned hammered in eyelets, made a corset, put in BONING and created a pretty finished looking punk era garment.  They are both winners, they are both tied. I am impressed with you both 👏👀✨
Wow I can't believe Ned didn't win this won he really deserved this win
First off, ned looked amazing! His mustache and bandana making him look like a stylist! He was absolutely ROBBED, he should of won first place. I would of totally worn that garment to a punk rock concert with some platform boots
AYO ADD CC
Eugene's dress needs to be made by a pro and sold. Batches. I'd buy it
If you're South African.. You know atleast one gogo that would wear Zack's dress
loved Eugene but Ned should've won, Kelsey's dress creative but messy and the attitude kinda 👎🏼, Zack has more effort than Kelsey but its okay Zack you can win another time
Ned should've won this one, his dress was amazing!
Ned's dress was amazing! He should show us more of his inner angsty teen xD
I love how Eugene styled his dress, and it took me a minute to take Neds in because it was very different, but Ned deserved that win. I liked the draping and shapes on Eugenes and how he styled it but at the end when he took the accessories off the dress just looked like draped fabric. Whereas Neds it’s completely raw, creative and true to its genre. Eugene always kills it but Ned deserved the win  Also loved having Kelsey! I stopped watching buzzfeed so it was lovely to see her in a video again
someone tell Zack that we did make men in dresses a thing
Well honestly this is now one of my favorite episodes. I really loved all that you guys did with each of these dresses; really great job all of you! They were all so unique and matched your personalities. Eugene like usual stealing my heart ❤️ not only did you pull off a unique dress; you rocked it well!!!! I loved the color. I like The old school elegance. personally I am madly in love with hoods or clothes that are more versatile in general and of course you put your own spin on it with the accessories and turned it into a character. I instantly thought little red riding hood in her older years hosting a dinner party but at the same time as an undercover assassin lol. Love it! Ned shout out to all the skater babies, the rebels, the underdogs, the misunderstood wolves and bats of the world! Black and red metal take over with the combat boots to kick any haters butt; Plus no one should ever get mad at a corset. kudos to you  making your own right on the spot. Kelly your dress was nice and fun and I was a big fan of the layers. coverage but open and I didn’t hate the fake pockets it was a nice spin on a sundress the different colors and textures are a big plus and yes mask it up without shame! Omg Zach Man you had me going there for a second I thought you made a beautiful...pillowcase 🤣🤣 at first. But your dress actually turned out super cute honestly just like the cutest grandma kind of vibe. I think you made a great choice with the fabric the jungle color was really peaceful then you’re right the V-neck made it super charming. Also I have no idea how you got that dress to go in such a triangle shape but again didn’t hate it it almost made me think of the Jetsons with the roundness at the bottom super interesting. Definitely keep your Mimi it looks super comfy like you could just take a nap in it 😊.
Kelsey is a whole mood throughout this. HAHA
If there was like some spicy ingredients or liquor , Eugene would totally pick it GAHAHAHAA
i just ordered your march! I'm so excited! I've wanted it for 3 years!
why did Eugene win??? maybe I’m not qualified enough to say anything but like his dress looked like dresses I made out of FELT when I was like 5??? 😭 NED THO, he had A CORSET, HAND DRAWN PATTERNS, AND MULTIPLE FABRICS???
Ned wad ROBBED
I can't stop thinking about Eugene's dress holy sh*t he needs to produce a real full fashion line because the STYLE wow. i know all the comments are saying Ned was robbed but like I stopped breathing watching Eugene's  also we need to fuckin bring capes back asap
Why is eugene so good at everything?! Y'all so funny
Idk who the white gurl is but I love her 🙊
so no one gonna talk about how eugene's flannel was inside out???
dude                                                        so cool
who's gonna tell Zach about femboys
Just based on the look,, kelsey's dress is stunning!!! It compliments her, brightens her vibe and adds motions when she walks
I wanna see Eugene on RuPaul's drag race so bad
Love Ned, he’s so no fucks given and I love that about him.
Maybe I'm wrong but I feel like Eugene presenting last help's him
I know in my heart, and everyone else's, NED WON. PERIODTT.
Kelsey channeled Keith very well.
why is no one talking about how good kelsey's keith impression is??? 😂
I like the new Keith 🤣
did kelsey have plastic surgery on the face
I would love closed captioning!
Ned absolutely killed it! He won in my eyes!
Ned was supposed to win .... come on now.
If the try guys can see this, I'm a big time Australian fan. May I please suggest you all try dressing up in extreme punk, emo or gothic styles please? 🥰
Ned got scammed hardcore
Ned put a ton of effort into his dress and did a fantastic job, but unfortunately for him, Eugene basically created a whole new dress style.
NED DESERVED TO WIN OMG
Kelsey is such a fun person I love how silly she is
“Basically, I’m just gonna fuck around and whatever I end up with I’ll say was intentional” - me in art school lol
Ned's dress was probably the most dark horse, come from behind moment of this series. I was truly impressed. Eugene needs to make more dresses, like just start now. But congratulations to all! They all looked good, even Korndiddy's meme.
Obv Eugene did a bang up job as usual but it was pretty basic. Ned had the most unique and a fun theme behind it.
Ned was so robbed smh like ofc they'd choose eugene
Ned can make me a dress any day!
I loved all the dresses. I’m proud of Ned and Eugene. But I kind of think Ned should have won his construction, plan, and design were way better. And did you see his confidence!
I love that we’re all here to unanimously fight for neds honor
Ned was robbed big time.
Ned should have won!
The moustache worked. Ned legit looked like an undergrad fashion design student trying to figure out how to piece together this dress he’s sketched 😂👌🏼
Dear God, Eugene's back is gorge.  My vote goes for Ned, that's wild and it looks so clean and finished for being a rush job.
How did Ned somehow end up w his pants off 😂
13:05 well guys in maid outfits are a thing lmao
honestly i wanna see Ned incorporate his dress into his normal wardrobe he looked so good !!!
honestly I think Ned should be first
Wow I am blown away by how well you all did. If I did this it would look like one of those big night shirts you wear to bed as a kid. So proud of you all. ❤️
THE MEAN GIRLS REFERENCE
That's a cool thing to do like a tiktok challenge
i just know in my HEART that kieth's dress would've been fire 😌
Ned definitely should've won. His dress was top notch.
Glad we all agree Ned won!
I’m a sewer and I love this
NED WAS ROBBED
I’m sorry did she say meth? Lol it was so nonchalant
Ngl I haven’t watched you guys in about 2-3 months and I can’t believe Ned only has a mustache
I love how "daddy's favorite" has become the norm, lol.
NED WAS ROBBED!!!!! NEEEEDDDD!!!!!!!!
Anyone else waited for Kelsey to try on Eugenes dress?
kelsey is literally so funny😂
my non-binary dream is to be able to make all my own clothes so i stop feeling dysphoria shopping  i think i like Ned's best, because he did wonderfully despite his inexperience, and i am, at heart, an angsty teen. 😆
So all the comments rooted for NED than Eugene!!  Am I right? Can we have majority vote??
neds is my fav I want it tbh.
I need an after-the-fact pattern for Eugene's. I need it in my life
The stache Ned ..... why
I can make a skirt all I need is a skirt sew it on and boom a dress ... I think
...8:49 did she just say the first time she smoked meth, or am I not hearing right.
Did Zach miss fem boy Friday
I really liked kelsey's dynamic with the try guys. I hope she comes back on the channel in the future!!
Kels is my Spirit animal
the try guys without recipes/ instructions: **exists** eugene: *im about to end this whole mans career*
It KILLS me that Keith wasn't here because we will never see Daddy's Favorite Dress
ned did a lot in a short amount of time, its just so very 2000s whereas Eugene's is timeless
Ok but I love Kelsey
Eugene's dress instantly reminded me of a hot assassin from assassin-creed, like lowkey a badass mafia-like figure, god when I learn how to sew this is gonna be on my list to make <33
3 hrs is definitely not enough time
Without instructions BRAS
I would wear Ned's
NED WAS ROBBED! Here’s how it should have gone down: 1. Ned (without question, as his was the most creative, complicated, and cohesive) 2. Eugene (a close second) 3. Zack 4. Kelsey (Here me out- Zack’s was simple for sure, and it looks like one cohesive piece and for someone who did not know what they were doing at all. I found it impressive that he was able to create the V-neck. Throughout the beginning of the episode they said this was Kelsey and Eugene’s competition to lose, but I could see the cuts and inconsistent seams throughout her entire dress. Sure, the mask disguised as a bracelet was a cool touch, but the faux pockets were ridiculous. This is not a dress anyone would wear. I don’t think many people would wear Zack’s dress either, but for sure it would serve many folks well as a “house dress”. Those are just my thoughts. PS: Ned really was robbed if I hadn’t already mentioned it. LOL
Zach is the kind of friend I need when I need help taking a photo
Seeing that crazy pattern on zach's hand I thought he's gonna channeling jlo's iconic plunging dress. Oh well....
WHERE DID KELSEY GET HER JUMPSUIT!!!! I need it!!!!
i love kels dress if that was real i’d totally buy it
Ok, I like Eugene’s dress, but Ned was totally robbed! The creativity and the fact that he made a corset! My dude was out there hammering fabric on the floor! Lol.
I love how comfortable Ned has become with femininity. He's come a long way.
I would wear the shit out of Eugene’s dress
Am I the only one who cringed whenever Kelsey said anything?
Eugene does have an advantage because he does do you dragon into a lot of that so I just think it’s on fair
i think we all need a zach to take our Instagram pictures
Where's Keith? Hahaha
The synergy in this episode feels off
This is the real election that should be debated right now. Ned vs Eugene
Zach you suck. Be more serious. You are not good at anything.
Eugene's dress just looks like he wrapped a blanket or two on his body
kpop guys in skirts n dresses happened like so long ago already 😭😂😂😂😭
Kelsey during this entire thing is a whole ass mood😂❤️
One day the guys are going to start rigging things to fight off Eugene's perfectness and still lose.
I love how the two judges that were the preppy popular girl and the goth got along and I live for it. I love that dynamic
Eugene will never be bad at anything .
Ned haters. He should always win.
NED WAS ROBBED WE WANT A REDO
Eugene needs to host a master class on how to be like him.
We need more of Kelsey 😂😂
haven't even watched the video yet. excited to see eugene turn it out once again
So used to seeing Ned without pants that I didn’t even notice for 5 whole minutes
i wanna see Ariel in Ned's dress.
Ned and Kelsey were my top two dresses
zack in a grandma dress
I... kind of loved Zack's dress. I would wear it. ALLLLL the time. It looks comfy as heck.
ned was ROBBED
Kelsey and Zach taking a selfie break is so funny to me.
Ned with the mustache and the dress looks like he belongs at a pride fest. Any one that has been to one knows the one person I’m talking about. It’s not bad, I’m just laughing my ass off at it
am I the only one who finds Kelsey a bit annoying? but maybe im just missing Keith
I love Eugene and he did a great job on his dress, but Ned absolutely killed this and his took far more work and creativity to make. He did the ribbing, added chains, used multiple fabrics, and all in 3 hours. I really feel like he should have won.
what episode of ru pauls drag race is this
Ned really said 🤟🏻👁👅👁🤟🏻
Wow I love Kelsey's dress! If only the back were neater. I love the overall look
Lol @ zach using binder clips as pins
Okay Ned was robbed
Kelsey is so cool haha can she be in some more future videos? sry for my English lol
Ned was robbed!!!!!!! Lol love you guys 🤣🤣
Ned crushed it though!!
i love eugene but ned was robbed that's all i have to say
They've really upped their cinematography. It really looks like a tv show.
Now this is bullshit... Neds dress is wayyyy more creative ,and constructed  better than Eugenes. Actually the best at construction! Eugenes dress is boring and plain and all over the place tbh.
I feel like Ned Should have won because his was so thought out but Eugene's was amazing too. I just think Ned was robbed out of this 😬
Eugene did mommy's favorite
Im only two minutes but seeing that Ned’s idea for his dress was “He was a sk8er boi” brought back memories. I’m glad that Ned also has an inner Avril inside of him.
I've missed her so much!
Ned deserved the win
26:12
Anyone else agree that Ned's mustache makes him look like a ginger Freddie Mercury
Give Ned credit tho.  Guy always does the boring safe version of the With a Recipe/Instructions contests... he fucking went for it this time!
Okay, yes, Ned should have won. That was AMAZING considering that he's never made a dress before. They were all great!! But Ned really went beyond the rest
I am willing to pay for Eugene's dress!!!
Ned was robbed!!
So sad that Keith wasn’t here to make Daddy’s Favourite clothing line
I want Eugene’s Cape of Fear dress.
Kelsey’s dress is what id want to wear  Zack’s was giving me jlo inspired with the print  Ned’s dress was amazing & should've won  Eugene’s with the shawl hood was a moment 😍
"You're supposed to have plans??" -me, in life
we have seen corsets and now we see ned in a corset I would love to see the try guys take on corseting
zack dude in maid outfits is actually the new hot topic
Kelsey saying ‘my favourite type of dress to wear is something...that you can pee easily in’, while wearing a jumpsuit to this video
I feel like the vibes are off in this video, like not everyone is too happy or theirs some tension between some of them. its a great video I just hope everyone enjoyed themselves
I'm gonna wear Eugene's dress in any occasion
I think the show should now be The Try Guys +1
I think if a woman modeled Ned's dress he would have won. I think Eugene just pulled off the runway better.
Ned will always be my fav Try Guy, and I adored his design, but the fact the panel had to even *discuss* who won after seeing Eugene ... Now come on.
yah know something women can wear pants and it's normal but when a boy wears a skirt /dress its gay????????????/
I love Eugene and his style but Ned 100% deserved the win. He hand wrote a pattern, added a corset  w i t h  b o n i n g, and genuinely rocked it. Not to mention how absolutely punk rock it was
EUGENE IN A DRESS EUGENE IN A DRESS
Eugene needs to be stopped. The cameraman and the editors need to be stopped. I don't watch the channel to have existential crises.
NEDS DRESS WAS THE BEST
26:09 you are welcome.(?
I sew a lot and heck I'm gonna make a dress like Eugene's.
I would argue that them measuring the same proves that Ned has a bigger butt because Kelsey probably has wider hips so Ned's butt must be a lot bigger in order to get the same measurement
Kelsey really channelled Keith’s blue squares
I heard Zach say Amumu and he had no idea what it was... So... "Try Guy Play League of Legends?"
no captions ): but nice video
With Neds new mustache he needs to be in Narcos
Ned went off with Richie Rich, Betsy, and moschino vibes. We stan
You guys are better than doing more videos with Kelsey
стоп а кто у кого спиздил формат и откуда у вас американ версия калинкина-
I was really confused at first as to why Ned had a hammer. I literally thought he was nailing his dress together.
RIGGED! Ned deserved that win..
Build a lego set without instrutions!!
Just me that thinks Ned should've won?
They are getting ready for Drag Race
Ned should have won
i want to see what Ariel would come up with
Why don’t the Try Guys try being guys for a change.
If Ned and Kelsey's dress ideas were professionally made I would %100 buy them.
Eugene is the Sanderson sister
I need to find Kelsies and Eugenes dress and but it😍😍❤️❤️🔥🔥or time to make my own😍
The try guys destroying toxic masculinity
It'd be so fun to make my own dresses but at the same time I'm an afab nonbinary and I don't want to be misgendered even more than I already am
Zacks dress is literally nurse but make it ✨tropical✨
17:05  Haven't watched to the end yet but I swear if the drsss doesn't have pockets-
Next Try Guys merch: Eugene's dress
Did anyone else get Kelsey's reference to Mean Girls?? At the 3 minute area
Why is Keith not participating?
Zack is like make dudes in dresses the next hot thing weebs just casually looking at Levi in a maid outfits
That mean girls reference tho
Smh Ned should have won he put in so much effort and his dress looked fucking amazing
I LOVE Kelsey sm my queen 💜💙💜
13:12 oh zack if only you knew you just aren't on the right side of tiktok
can we have a zach meme in the merch store??
Personally I think Ned should of won 🏆
All 4 dresses were so good! I'm so surprised that i liked all of them. And i actually agree with the judging but Dammit I'd wear them all!
Zach, you don’t have to wait for men in dress to be a “popular trend” to do it. If it makes you happy, just do it
I’ve decided that Ned wins
Kelsey's impressions were pretty spot on
I have a bigger butt than Ned? I guess all those squats payed off
Ned should have won. His was my favorite!
Kelsey as Keith reacting to 3rd place was spot on.
I think I would probably actually wear ned’s dress
As a fashion design student I can definitively say that Eugene’s dress is not dior’s new look at all and my SOUL DIED watching hot ankles DRAW THE SLEEVES LIKE THAT I DONT UNDERSTAND how he got that on????
lol when is eugene gonna not win
...can she become a try guy
Awwww Ned actually looked so sad 🥺
Eugene... 😍
Zack: “don’t worry about it” 😂😂😂
Woah... Ned’s dress was AMAZING!
You guys should build chairs from scratch without instructions
These ain’t the men who stormed Normandy...
I want a fully finished Ned's dress. I'd rock Eugene's too.
Ned tried real hard, but Eugene’s was a better dress.
All Imma say is Ned was ROBBED! That first place was his (but I love you eugene!)
I get the widow of a rich man at the funereal. Like she obviously killed him for his money.
I know you read a lot of comments like this but I would really like you to take 1 minute to watch my beats, it would really make my day, take care of yourself ;)
That is so fetch.
Takes a lot of brain. Phrasing
I would love to see the Try Wives react to their creations
Ned had a plan, fuck, we were supoosed to have plans ?
Me: Damn I’d wear each of these!!   Also me in most dresses: ehhhhh I gotta cover my legs and my shoulders and my back omg people are gonna look at me omg I’m not comfortable with this 😭😭  Yeah nah it’s legit a struggle behind comfortable in dresses which is why I usually wear dresses that cover up a bit and then wear stockings.
This reminds me of bts making outfits.
Eugene just look good in everythings he wear.
I love Kelsey's dress.
Ok it takes me two months to sew one dress with instructions which is about 20 hours
RAIN ON MIMI
NED WON
*NED deserved to win.* the whole aesthetic he went with was so well-captured in his dress-making process. he used a hammer to put the holes in; and if that doesn't scream meta and rebellious idk what does. eugene made an elegant dress but he said in the beginning he was didn't see many non-binary dresses. if you say that wouldn't you want to make a design like that? ned's design was way more gender-inclusive than eugene's too. yes everyone did well.. but ned absolutely killed this one.
Kelsey is so fucking funny I cant
I would 1000% wear all of these dresses. They all did so well!!!
If zach wins then the patriarchy wins. Zach dont worry about it.
13:13 ZACH IT IS THE HOT THING✨✨✨
Ned should have won this, he had so many more features to the dress and it looked so much better and he put so much work into it, he had a plan and it worked, Ned should have won !
i would actually buy a real version of kelsey’s dressed. the different layers of fabric, the leg slit, the body chain! i love it. and ned’s is fucking awesome omg you can tell he worked so hard on it and it was worth it.
As a costume designer, this made me a little sad
ned's look was stunning and the construction was amazing and I think he served but eugene served looks only but he came thruuuu
I hate how Eugene always wins when I don’t feel he was the true winner in the challenge 😒
i dont like the moustache
Ned's dress was so different. Loved it.
Ned is definitely the winner in my eyes!
To be honest I loved Eugene’s dress more. It was the kind of dress that with some cleaning up I could see it being for purchase on ASOS Design, and I would buy it. Ned’s dress is very Hot Topic which would have appealed to me a few years ago, but my aesthetic has changed so while I find it nostalgic, creative and well made, I wouldn’t really reach for it.
Omg I love Kelsey!!
Kelsey's Keith interpretation when she was getting judged was hilarious and I love the bonus at the end! Hahaha 🤣🤣
Honestly Ned deserved this win, even though Eugene also did fantastic.
zach’s dress was constructed so well tho?? like no weird hemming as compared to kelseys so i’m confused
Ahh no captions :(
Ned's dress honestly blew me away! It absolutely screamed "masculine" and I think I saw the year 2090
Ok we all know who should've won. But if I don't see Ned in dressed more often I'm gonna throw shit. This man looked SO CONFIDENT I CAN'T it was badass
Eugene was so kind and encouraging to everyone. Loved Neds and Eugenes look.
"Basically I'm gonna f*ck around..." -- Zach  I just wish he would *try* even half as much as the other guys. It kind of feels like he doesn't respect the challenges. 😕
We want Kelsey as the 5th try guy..
Since Keith was so negative about Mikaela in the "trending youtbe videos" video the Try Guys could make a video with her as an apology, since she is the queen of sewing!
I love how they're comparing and admiring each others' butts..lol
Omygosh I didn’t actually think any of them could pull off those dresses off. That’s 🤯🤯🤯
NED WAS ROBBED
13:15  zach,, hun,,, we already have,,, guys in maid dresses and cat ears,,, litch rally the dream
Why does this place look exactly like Chloe Tings workout background???
I would like to buy Eugene's dress pls n thx
...this is what i love about try guys.. confidence is at max.. hahaha..
I NEED Eugene's Dress  I love the color and the style EVERYTHING, holy shirrrrt
How about each of the try guys create a 3 piece collection and host a mini runaway where they will be juded by: Looks, Originality, Did it respect the theme, Is it a collection and the public would be us in the internet.
15:12?
I really wanna buy Eugene's dress..but with pockets.  If someone can find a look-alike or a pattern for it then please respond with the link.
Zach's dress looked so much better than Kelsey's trash of a dress. At least it had more integrity
Can we talk about how Kelsey fits well here??? Hahaha he’s like the best person to be Keith’s understudy
I think this is the first time I've ever disagreed with Eugene winning. Ned's dress was so impressive considering what he was able to do in the time. Eugene's looked like all one piece of fabric draped all around. Ned was robbed.
Ned deserved better. In that amount of time he created a masterpiece.
Ned won
Im imagining keith watching micarah tewers
Eugenes comment about the cape makes me think of our good bean Bernadette. Always need a cape
kelsy's impressions of keith were hilarious
Kelsey is always so energetic i love it
Ned should've won his dress 👗 was something that I would wear. I love Eugene's dress but the hood concept is throwing me off. As a trans woman I would wear Neds and or (replacement Keith's) dress.
Honestly Eugene looks like little red riding hood gone bad and ned looks like he's a rock star
I hate ned’s mustache
Honestly, I think either Ned or Eugene could have one this. But... I definitely admire Ned's dress.
This is definitely Eugene's competition.
Can we have a gingerbread house episode for Christmas pls?
I'm afraid I'm going against the tide here but I'm not a huge fan of Ned's. Props to him for creativity though.
Petition to recount the votes and give ned his credit
13:09 HONGJOONG, CHANGKYUN, MINGHAO, SEUNGMIN, WINWIN, BYEONGKWAN YALL HEARD HIM JUST PUT ON A DRESS ALREADY
Even tho his dress wasn’t the best I love all the happiness that zacks dress brought him Just me ok
Kelsey should have had the top back of her dress as a big bow, less sewing but would have been super cute
Eugene are you going to make a few of these because i want one.
We all agree Eugene's dress was great. But Ned should have won this or at least share the win with Eugene. His dress was very creative and also very difficult to make. He should have give some props for his effort
Okay but Ned and Eugene have never looked hotter
EUGENE IS SO EXTRAAA YAZZZ. LOVE HOW NED STEPPED OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE! Well dooone!! You rocked it! Kelseyyy, I would sooo wear your design out of all of em <333
I would like to see a well done version of those dresses 🤔
i'd buy Ned's dress like yes ill spend money on that
I would actually wear Ned’s and Eugene’s dresses
Kelsey give me Penny vibes from TBBT
Zach is the only one who did sleeves. And he added a nice seam that nobody else did
Dudes in skirts is already so popular rn so Im sure dudes in dresses isn't too far off 🤩🤩🤩
I'd love if the Try Guys had a pop-up dress shop, selling these dressed they designed   And see whose design sells most? 🤭
I love the impromptu Photoshoot!! Lmao!!!!
If I was in one of these, I think I would get a pretty okay ranking because my mother has so many skills and I kinda learnt from them.
I'm impressed by Ned. He should have won.
This is healthy masculinity
Is imagine Eugene would dress like David Rose if he could find stuff he liked.
Does anyone else think Zach looks like he’s auditioning for a remake of Psycho?
we've been doing boys in dresses on tiktok
hmm .. because of too much competition (in comments area), i think they should try doing without instructions but, this time, they work together to make something ..
considering Eugene and Ned both had the same amount of time, Ned should have won, since he used several fabrics, techniques and embellishments. Ned's also looks more like he had intended, Eugene's was more of a fluke
God.  I would buy all of these.   er.  If..  y'know, tidied up a bit.  BUT THOSE BOYS,  oh my gosh.  I"m pretty asexual 90% of the time but THOSE BOYS.
Ned sipping his coffee in his underwear stressed out while Eugene is talking is probably the best moment of this video 😂😂😂😂😂
Zack's slow-mo cat moment gave me life.
Lowkey expected Kelsey to be the expert for some reason.
Eugene went from Mother of the Bride to Mother. Of. The. House.
Sometimes i get this weird feeling and think: -Am i real ? Is this world is real ?
I love how at some point Ned took his pants off to I guess try on the dress and then just never put them back on XD
Ned is looking like eggman from the sonic live action
Finally. I miss Kelsey!
To me Ned is the real winner. But they all did really good. 🥰
NED WAS ROBBED
Eugene, fashion designer yas!!
No, the mustache has not gotten normal...
hi
13:09 love you for saying that Zach! Armys let's gooo!!
kesley's dress looked the best imo
what an amazing episode! i appreciate all your work so much
I must say that I'm here for Kelsey's personality. I'd love to see her back.   Also, Ned and Eugene should have tied for 1st.
try guys try figure skating
there were so much sewing puns but Keith wasn't there to make them
I just rewatched the video where Zach got hair restoration and when I see this video, his hair really does grow well!
You guys should collab with Micarah Tewers!
where's closed caption? :'(
I want Keith back 🙊
Is it just me or does Zach sound like he knows what he is doing when he's talking himself through the steps!
Kelsey's energy was exactly what this episode needed LOL she was too funny. I'll have to go see what type of content she has
Zack looks like Sid the sloth and that just makes me love him more 😍
This was uploaded on my 18th birthday :)
i need someone to make Kelsey's dress! it's gorgeous
I have never seen this Channel before so I don’t know who these people are but I saw a lot of comments about how the guy in the black should have one but I disagree because the challenge was for the best looking dress sure his construction was great but some random person on the streets not gonna see a dress and think wow what great construction no there gonna think wow what a beautiful dress and the guy who won had the most beautiful dress
Wow! Ooo la la Eugene!  But Ned was robbed.
15:00 kelsey is every cosplayer the night before a con 😭😭😭
Zach is a sweetheart. I love that dress.
Ned just casually breaks out the hammer and puts in eyelets 🤣
I would buy Eugene's dress! So good.
Kelsey's Keith impression alone should have bumped her up a spot
Can we have a "Kelsey eats everything on the _____ Menu" video though?
Is it me, or has Ned leveled up in dad vibes since he's now a father of two. Hardcore hammering in the eyelets.
So nice to see Kelsey!
it was Kelsey's Keith impressions for me
kelsey REALLY delivered on the keith aspect LMAOOO they kinda have the same vibe
i love eugene but NED WAS ROBBED
Omg I just had a thought   Let Eugene wear a maid costume   Idk why  But   Zach's dress reminds me of Christmas costumes lol
Is it just me or is Eugene’s shirt inside out?
Where are your masks?
kelsey is so pretty wtf
I live how Eugene is so creative and if not mistaken most time no 1 winner . I wish I had Eugene's creativity for work. ❤
For once I completely disagree with Eugene getting first.
I mean this comment from complete peace and love but I notice that if every without instruction or without a recipe Zach does not try. He gives little effort because he thinks he will fail so he gives up. It is starting to become disheartening... The “I don’t make anything good” attitude... Zach is better than that
Omg I love Kelsey
everyone is so upset with the results. Ned ftw!!
I WANTED NED
That Keith impression by Kelsey was just *chef's kiss* hahahahaha
In a way for me Eugenes dress was too plain it needed some sparkle or something some sort of pattern maybe Neds was Phenomenal
Eugene I'm sorry I love you but ned should have won this he took 3 hours to take the pieces together and in those three hours he calculated and cut and try to make the back looked like a pain but yeah my opinion he should have won he looked so confident  ;-;
Zach's button down jacket thing is fire.... like.... where do i cop one
Shoulda been Ned. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Zach: *comes out* Me: That's a daster. Eugene: *basically agrees that it's a daster*
Omg. Eugene = Sexy.
First the met gala outfit and now this, Ned must've been a fashion designer or seamstress in a past life or something. I was very impressed, and I think he should've won.
How the fuck are people saying Ned was robbed? That THING...was atrocious....
I’m sorry but Eugenes was better.
21:59 i dont get Eugene's use of "ethnic" like everyone has an ethnicity. so saying "ethnic people know" is confusing because that would literally be  everyone but i don't think he was using it in that sense.  it was used in a sense of a certain group of people not all people.
I personally think when judging on the class of if something is a dress, Eugene simply outdid the other competitors, I understand technical choice wise, Ned was the deserving winner, but the final look is also very important; and for that I think Eugene just took the cake! Honestly it’s a dress most wouldn’t mind wearing.
*The Try Guys make masks without instructions*
13:10 - someone needs to tell zach about femboys on tiktok asap
was waiting to see kels in eugenes dress 🥺
l was hoping to see Ned as 1st place but... like.. l thought Kelsey was going to be no. 2? Ned no. 1 and Eugene No. 3. l was shocked that Eugene's dress was on the top even the structure and design are just 'MEH'. l'm shook, just shook. ☕
missed opportunity = mommy’s favourite
"I'm just too lazy to put it into action", me
May I suggest; Try Guys colour each other's hair?
“if zack wins that’s embarrassing” zack: dont worry about that”
It’s kinda endearing how Zach always messes up
Eugene only won because of how he shaped the dress to his body let’s be real
me, a person who makes vintage style clothes:   :'C
i feel like dresses would be kind of easy to make
Ned was robbed!!
Zachs dress looks like European grandma’s cooking dress
I knew Eugene would win. He always does.
For me:  Ned Kelsey  Eugene  Zach  I think Ned, Kesly, and Eugene are all on the same level in cuteness but I gave Ned extra points for it actually looking finished, following a specific aesthetic, also doing the corset. I gave Kelsy extra points for creativity, being with the time, the flowiness. And Zach lost for looking like a house dress.
You guys are so gay the gays want nothing to do with you
Imagine the 'Cap'abilities
that Keith impression tho XD
I could see myself wearing ned's dress at a concert or something
I would love to know the name of Mari's cosplay business, please and thank you!
Imagine this.. by just not skipping ads you’re feeding baby wes.
"If Zach wins, then the patriarchy wins" XD
Why does Ned act more gay than Eugine does?
Personally think Ned shouldb'e been first place!
Zac's dress looks exactly like a kurti I had🤭🤭🙈
Ned’s dress really showed off how much he’s been working out 👏
If y'all had put Roman into the title card from the get go, I would have watched this video DAYS ago! I'm tired of seeing Ned and Fred's faces in the thumbnail in the EXACT same expressions they Always have!
Eugene did such a good job. Like, honestly, if there were a few finishing touched done, I would not be surprised if I saw that on a runway...
I actually wanted to see Kelsey try Eugene's dress
Idk man, grommets and boning? Ned should’ve won.
22:44 no one gonna talk bout neds back tho?? 👀
My cats name is Meemee 🤣🤣
Eugene had better design as it’s something that could be on a runway actually.
I'm sorry but Ned won this one 💯
WHY DOES NED NEED A CALCULATOR TO DO 12 TIMES 4 HE WENT TO YALE
I don’t know what y’all talking about Eugene ate as usual 🤪😂
They all did a very good job 👏
idc what yall say, i liked zach's jalabiya.
Bored in quarantine? Checkout my latest vid!! Much love y’all 🥰
Kelsey honestly did have a look. But that back piece of her dress really did need more sewing to look anything other than tacked on. Ned did so good, but again there was a big piece of lacing in the back of his top that I think kept him from winning. Eugene had a back problem as well. But I think it just needed a hook and eye at the top of his zipper to make the back of his skirt actually come together. That, and how much he sewed vs taped/glued was why he ultimately won. (And I love Zach. I do. He's underappreciated as a Try Guy sometimes. But boy. That hemline was so janky.)
You guys should have an advice series similar to neds married vs single series with kelsey
Eugene being so extra is my favourite thing in the video, just love it. Every dress were cool in their own way
Sick of Eugene winning when he just dorsal deserve it 🤷🏼‍♂️ the other guys have way more fun and Ned 1000% eon that there!
hahah
I love Eugene but NED WAS ROBBED
She did such a great impression of Keith LMAO!
Every time she said blood sweat and tears I kept on singing blood sweat and tears from bts😆
The back on Eugene, Lord have mercy 😍 the heels! 😍
Ned killed 👀👍🏾
Can someone who knows how to make dresses recreate Kelsey’s dress cause i think there’s a lot of potential there?
my first thought and comment was just that "this doesnt look super socially distanced or have masks..." so like... :/ please stay safe
20:38 lmaooooooooo!!!! 🤣
"Every. Bitch. Loves. A. Sundress." betch yasssss
Not sure I enjoyed Kelsey in this. She was too much and didn't seem to care. Also Ned is the winner in my eyes!
The meth comment from Kelsey 😳
should have been Ned in 1st!
Zach just not having a plan and just fucking off is literally me and I can’t stop laughing at him. I love him so much. 🤣🤣🖤
The Keith at the end was amazing 😂😂😂
I'm loving Ned's dad stash
Probably the best Keith impression i've ever seen! Major props!
I love Kelsey omg
Justice for Ned
Keith's wife made a gorgeous dress and a beautiful model. I also loved her attitude. But sorry, honey, Eugene literally to be one the outstandingly attractive men on Earth. And this comes from an Asexual.
Omg i love zach 😂😂😂😂
NED FLANDERS !!!!!!
WHEN MUSTACHE DADDY NED CAME OUT PUNK AND FREAKING CRUSHED IT
I need Roman’s shirt !!! Where is it from ?
You know what, i dont even need to watch it till the end.. i know eugene will slay this :")
Was this recorded pre COVID?
ya’ll notice that something fell off Kelseys dress in her lil montage lmao
eugene really treated this like project runway .. and i loved it LOL
NED WAS ROBBED!! I loved Eugene's dress I really did but Ned's was just so damn impressive. Like boning and shit, that's hard. And it looked so cool!!!
Honestly I want to see someone actually make Kelsey’s into a wearable dress because Lowkey it looked really good
Listen, I love Eugene to death but Ned made a great looking garment with boning AND created a print... I think he should have gotten first place
Kelsey is the female equivalent of zach
I'm kind of tired of Rugene winning everything lmao Ned deserved this one
i would LOVE if they had the professionals redo their designs and give them their vision to actually be able to wear thatd be so fun
i love ned's, but the fact that it's sleeveless instead of having overly long sleeves with thumb holes is not doing it for me with the whole scene vibe he went for. eugene's look was perfect considering the time restraint. kelsey's cottage core vibes were great. zach's, well....let's just say it could easily be repurposed as a halloween costume if he wanted to go as a little old lady. 10/10 ankles though.
noooooooooo i wanted ned to win DX
But where is kelsey’s jumpsuit from tho?
they shouldve got bestdressed aka ashley
Zach's looks kinda like a floral version of almost every Australian School dress 😂😂😂
I disagree! Yes Eugenes dress was nice but Neds dress should’ve won, it had way more details and very creative lol
They should cut hair without instructions
"So punk rock"  Me: *thinks of 5sos*
Ned deserved this one.
The next challenge with out instructions should be for making something out of leather (belt, boots, wallet, hat)
Waitttt, I kinda want to see Kelsey in that dress
I need Eugene’s and the better version of Kelsey’s dresses omg they are sooooo cool
Getting strong 'Mallory Archer" vibes from Eugene when on the catwalk.
the sad thing is zach’s dress could’ve been ok if he used different material 😭
Zach :dudes in dresses  Kpop stans : MONSTAX
does anyone know where Kelsey's jumpsuit is from? I'm dyyyyying it's so cuuute
Okay but imagine all this looks done by a professional they got the idea and now I want to really see it formal
I miss you Keith!
Zach's dress made me think of tropical Little Lulu or Little Orphan Annie from the comics
OMG NOW I WANT EUGENE'S DRESS IT LOOKS SO AWESOME I LOVE IT
Eugene's look reminds me of mariah from jjba
I'm late. Has anyone talked about the serious Julien vibes Ned is throwing?
Maybe they have a new camera or it’s the lighting but this video visually looks very nice
Kelsey is chaotic neutral 😂
My 5 yr old daughter  1st place is the girl cause she had a mask 2nd place is the jungle dress 3rd place is Eugene 4th place was the one who was mostly naked   Hahah loved it!
Ned should have won not Eugene.
Zach’s dress reminds me of something that my grandma would wear 😂
Zack you're calling on the wrong fandoms, J-rockers (mainly visual Kei) had the guys in dresses locked down years ago ;)
I was really hoping the end scene would be kelsey in Eugenes dress
ned really looking like freddie mercury in this video
NED SHOULD'VE WON
Ned should have won😭
Zachs hair looks so good !!!
Zach just made a Lilly Pulitzer dress lol
I’m sorry but Ned was def #1
seriously, what is Eugene not good at
I need more kelsey with the try guys
I had a feeling Zach would sew his arms shut and he did 😂
Kelsey comedically CARRIED this video
did kelsey get work done? she looks so different from the early buzzfeed days lmfao
wait until zack learns about maid dresses
I LOVED Kelsey's dress!!!! Also Eugene's!!! Zach's was pretty bad.
I know he’s married to Ariel but can we talk about Ned’s back muscles. God damn. 🔥🔥
Oh yeah. Kelsey needs to stay!
Eugene won because he looked best in the dress, in my opinion. I wanted Ned to win. I would ACTUALLY wear that dress.
This is one of the times I'm proud growing up a poor Mexican because my mother would make every Halloween costume, every school play costume, every random skirt from scratch and some of that process is in my head lol
And baby, that's jazz 🎷
I always want Eugene to win bc I love Eugene. But Ned's dress was freaking great.
Where is keith? And how come he’s not here?
Nah, the mustache is horrible XD
Ned looks like a grindr model
kelsey at 14:55, is literally me the day before a con. way too close to home lol
Keith...... 😢
Plushies is gonna be soooo easy they can just make a snake lmfaoo
Kelsey's evil laugh when she said: "Just like your career as a Fashionista" sends me 💀💀💀💀💀
Id wear all but the mimi
Try guys make a lego set with out instructions 🤗🤗🤔😀😅😃 Xxx
Honestly they all did absolutely fucking great
Eugene and ned fucking rocked
Anyone know where I can get Kelsey's jumpsuit lol
And with that, I have watched every Try Guys video in order! It took me about two months. That includes all the ones from BuzzFeed, and all the mini series like Keith Eats and Candid Competition. I started college this year and it’s been kinda stressful and lonely, but these guys have made it so much better and have inspired me to always keep trying no matter what
Keith couldn't handle another loss.
omg Kelsey is so annoying in this video
Zach: make boys on dresses the next hot thing The entirety of tik tok this Halloween: simping over boys in maid costumes and boys in skirts in general
nah Ned should have won. love them all but Ned really killed it
I'm actually so impressed with Ned, though. He did really well, and he was robbed goddamnit.
I love the sewing challenge episodes of Drag Race
I need friends who will willingly take Instagram photos of me like Zach and Kelsey
Ned was robbed!!!! He and Eugene shouldve Tied
First thought when the video started...   Pfft fucking ned got a mustache
is that Zach wearing Batik?😳
Can this be the last video Kelsey is ever featured in lolollll
Anyone know where Kelsey got her jumpsuit ??? It looks so cute and comfy
this is the sexiest Ned has ever looked
13:10 Dudes in dresses is a trending hashtag now lol
But for real, I wan't a legit version of Eugene's dress...
is Zach even a Try Guy anymore cause he never tries actually
YOOOOOOO EUGENE IN THOSE HEELS
I f*cking want to remake Eugene dress for me. But properly x)
I love your moustache-it is Movember here in Australia where guys grow mows for the month of November to bring awareness to  men's health; testicular and mental health so thanks for the support.
Uhh why does Ned look like hitler?! 😳
Ned 110% boo
Zach reminds me so much of Simon from Shadowhunters
i hate when a spoiler comment ends up being the top comment bc then i can’t avoid it :(
Eugene might have won, but its Ned who had the popular vote..
KELSEY IS MY NEW FAVOURITE TRY GUY I WILL ACCEPT NO CRITICISMS
Where was Keith?!  Missed his energy. Also , am I the only one that finds Kelsey very annoying?!  Like if you agree.
@zach referencing making muffins without a recipe... I'm waiting haha
Out of all these Neds is the only one I'd consider wearing! I love that!  Being emo/goth/metal was never a phase for me, its who I am. Edit:Loving the amount of support in these comments. Wish the real world was this accepting of alternative culture
y isn't Keith in this video?
"There's so much here that I love: the lines, the symmetry--" THE BUTT <3
Eugene is a Markplier that can drink
These episodes become boring with eugene winning
Booooo Ned's win was stolen from him!!! 😭 Eugene's dress was fantastic and I want one, but still!!!!!

NED was the best!!
Nah. Ned won this by far
I think scoring should be done on a 3 point system, for each category, winner is whoever has the most points.
I just... can't get over how hot Ned is, always. xD
I was really rooting for Ned. He should’ve won honestly.
Seriously!? Ned hammered grommets, and put in ribbing!! I love Eugene, but WTH!?!
I posted the hairdressing station in my pajamas.
i have to say that ned did such a good job!!
Ned, to me...   you are the winner.
God I've missed Kelsey! I love when she's in episodes
I really like zachs dress!
Zach out here making a pillow case 😂
After watching this video, I have much more respect for people who make dresses, well clothes, period
“Thank you for believing in my queerness” omg that has to be one of my favorite try guys line 😂
Next try guys without instructions - ft. miles
Ned should've won :/

I GOT GOODEBUMPS WHEN NED CAME STOMPING THE HOUSE DOWN🥺🥵🥵🥰 i loved his confidence and he looked good tho
Ned was robbed.
Ned!! Deserved!! The!! Win!!!
An Army here, we already have dudes in croptops, and some in dresses or skirts. we need more tho
when you literally just saw ASOS sell the idea of Zach's dress yesterday hahahahaha
"If Zach wins??? Then the Patriarchy wins" hahahaaha
Compared to a lot of other Without Instructions videos, I'm actually impressed with how well they all did. All 4 of them actually produced something that was generally a dress and wasn't overly odd or strange, but was generally functional. (Hot glue aside XD)
I want Eugened Dress
Ok so just came back to this Channel and... ZACH HAS THICC HAIR
How about each of the try guys create a 3 piece collection and host a mini runaway where they will be juded by: Looks, Originality, Did it respect the theme, Is it a collection and the public would be us in the internet. indeed!
Heh, I think I prefer Keith. 😏
Ned was robbed that boning deserved first place period!
what if y'all added closed captions so i could actually watch this video lol
I would wear Eugene's dress, but Ned's was amazing and much more accurate to his original vision
Try Guys try playing Phasmophobia?
Have Keith try the Wendy’s breakfast menu
Ned's the winner for me!
Did she say the first time she smoked meth? Lol
I really loved Kelsey's dress. All 4 lined up, that's the only one I would ever wear or purchase. It's simple but pretty, and I love the flowy-ness. If only she had made the pockets!!!
kelsey from 16:12-16:47 was a riot
4:28 If Kelsey was really Keith... when finding out she and Ned had the same size butt, she woulda said "BUTT TWINSSS!!!"
Ned in his underwear 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
why do they not even give zach a chance): like right away they dismiss him
heey the asian american was on Brooklyn Nine Nine!!!!!!
For me, Ned is the winner.
Eugene really needs to make a fashion line.
Can't we call it a tie for first!! NED 1000% better on his dress than pants!!
can we talk about how Ned 👏 D E L I V E R E D 👏 a full Dad mustache?
After Eugene was pronounced as the winner you could clearly see that Ned was pretty bummed. I like Eugene’s piece as well but honestly though, I feel like Ned should’ve won. 🥺✨
Okay but i want Zach to win one of these >:(
I need Ned's dress like right now. Hot topic sponsor him please
Ned got robbed
Ned deserved that winnnnnn look at that boning! Those eyelets!
I loved Kelsey. So funny and outgoing. 😂
I think Ned deserved that 1st place js 🤷🏻‍♀️
EUGENE WAS GREAT BUT NED DESERVED TO WIN!
Why are the captions unavailable?
Ned u get the people's choice first position!!
Where are the irons? I don't see any irons, it would make it so much easier
I was hoping to see Kelsey wear Eugene's dress
Ned deserved to win!
Her impression of Keith when she got third was perfect 😭
They really said ✨four pretty best friends✨😌
I'm *sew* in love with these clothing videos! More please 💕
AREEE YOU KIDDDINGGMEEE! NED HANDS DOWN HAD THE BEST DRES!!
Ned's was so coooooool
shiver me timbers
I want to see a woodworking without instructions!
I thought it should have been Ned he made a damn corset piece and boning are you kidding me like if you think it should have been Ned
NED WAS ROBBED NED WAS ROBBED OMFG I REALLY THOUGHT HE'S GONNA WINNNNNNN
You know Zac has spent too much time with Maggie when he makes a scrub dress
Ou Eugene lovve that shirt
Ugh I wanted Ned so bad to win
These guyss racists
Ned should have won this like I get that Eugene's was more professional but 100% neds was this moment
A couple things to note about this episode:  1) The cinematography looks so different than past videos. In a good way! More... professional? Whatever you did here - looks fantastic.  2) The dynamic. It’s.... more calm. Doesn’t seem as showy. Also something I liked about it.  Anyone else have these thoughts?
Ned should have won!
Bruh i died when zach was asking kelsey to help him out of the dress. Kelsey's reply was fucking EPIC!
Hi.
У меня мать швея, отец швея...  у меня я швея
Ned's was so good
Ned with that hair do and mustache looks like he belongs in the past
Ned totally deserved that win like come on. I love Eguene but I feel like he already gets a leg up for things like these even when he doesn’t deserve it
lol when you have a bigger butt than ned hmmm..
so kelsey is a typical LA girl lol
i absolutely love them destroying toxic masculinity. every man should look up to them.
Kelsey really provided Kieth energy this entire episode!!
love how zach suggested boys in skirts as the next trend. i hope it’s also bc he wants to try new things out. nana’s dress rlly suits him
pls ned start wearing dresses on a daily basis
Ned was cheated and its a damn shame. His garment was the best hands down.
I love to see Kelsey again together with the Try Guys! ❤
Not related to the video but, Do the try guys know about Thomas Sanders?
All the comments saying Ned was robbed- here’s my unwanted opinion  It’s just not flattering IMO? the low waistline low key ruins it. It’s AWESOME and I do think he deserved more credit, but I still think Eugenes was better. He had a lot of really cool draping which led to a much more interesting silhouette, he sewed everything (Ned used tape, but he also sewed a lot!) and actually hemmed a lot of his edges. The cape and shawl aspects look really cool! I think monochromatic had its place, and here it made the dress look more classy and expensive. The zipper made it fit him better too. I don’t wanna put anyone down, but Eugenes dress was really cool and he deserves more credit!
NED NAILED THIS EPISODE,NO HATE TO EUGENE WINNING LIKE I LOVE THEM ALL BUT DANGG NEDS WORK IS REALLY PRETTY AND THAT ATTEMPT CORSET THO, LIKE HEY JUDGES WHY DIDDDD YOU ROBBED NED LOL BUT ANYWAYS I LOVEEEE ALL THEIR WORK
'if Zach wins...'   Zach: Don't even worry about it    Lmaooo. M wheezing
Ned was R O B B E D
Zach out here acting like femboy friday ain't already a thing. we gotchu
Dresses are the very first clothing for men and women. Pants and very new .
The tiktok guys in dresses is already a trend and a fashion statement. Boys look cute af in dresses and there are a ton a videos of femboys looking fly af
Zach's looks like RBG (RIP) on vacation
I’m a london fashion student and I was just crying this whole episode 😂
Ok I need Kelsey's jumpsuit 😩
I wonder if they kept the dresses afterwards haha. And Ned is super cute in that outfit hahaha. Cant wait for the plushies episode!
Hey y’all go pick up some RKT Stock today it’s the next Zillow almost earnings  too
I think they should ass a survey at the end of these so we can vote CAUSE THIS TIME I WANTED NED TO WIN
NED WAS ROBBED
kelsey's great. we want more
Please add captions to your videos to make them more accessible ❤
Ned should've won.
eugene really made keith's "daddy's favorite" into "mommy's favorite"
Keith: Kelsey needs to make 'daddy's favourite'
I loved Ned's dress...all that graffiti and extra little bits...o boi o boi thats one heck of a dress...he delivered beyond expectations
Ned is the winner
Im gay but eugene is making me 👀
Ned deserved first lol
Ironic that Kelsey is here to replace Keith and she chose ‘Daddy’s Favourite’ dress
I think the perfect follow up to this would be ''professionals  vs the try guys dresses'' where each one of the try guys gets one professional who helps them make an actual dress that they wouldn't be afraid to wear out on the street and that wouldn't fall apart in the evening but they stay close to their original dress, just make fancy and cute
Why is ned absolutely killing it in this video he even just looks like a stylist
I wish yall would've brung me on set!! lol seems fun !
Ned should've won.
Eugene's dress was such a cool concept. I would love to see a runway show based around that theming, i.e. cowls and capes. Chuck some face masks in as well and it would be very cool for right now.
Ned for #1
I love Kelsey 💕
Ned absolutely killed this competition!!!
We need more Kelsey!!
Why is Keith not there?
Is it just me or is Kelsey annoying af?
3:09 *Kim Namjoon has entered the chat*
Where did Kelsey get her white boots???
Zach. We got you. BUT some of our kpop men already started with wearing skirts so dresses arent too impossible so lets hope. <3
I’m sorry to say this but Ned with a mustache looks like a trump supporter lol. I love u y’all
Not even close for 1st place
I absolutely love Kelsey ♡ she is amazing and so funny
I think Zack's dress would have worked better with a belt, but still cute!  Everyone did amazingly!! :D
I am really proud of Ned. I knew Eugene would do well as he does in most of these shows but I felt that Ned really went out of his comfort zone and tried really hard. You should be very proud of yourself.
I'm so proud of Ned. He had so much fun and felt comfortable showing it! Idk he just felt more chill. So confident! Go Ned!
I just adore Kelsey.
Does Zach ever actually try? Just out of curiosity hahaha this was a cool video though, hope they do other sewing without instructions videos Kelseys photo shoot with Zach was pretty great haha
For me Ned is def the winner 🎉🎉
Kelsey's impression of Kieth is so funny but accurate haha. Love it! 😂❤️
Kelsey's dress is sooo cute
Ned's smile when Eugene was impressed with him😂
*NED WAS ROBBED!* 👿
Yes Ned it’s normal and honestly you pull it off very well.
Eugene is like an Ube Queen.
Although I like Eugene's dress better for the significant WoW factor, I think Ned's construction and fit should have put him in first place. Good job guys!
Nobody : Eugene : Ugh ! I didn't mean this to be sweet
So everytime I come to the try guys, my assumption is that they just try to do female things or wear girl things?
Zach is such a good photog
) A commentary titled “Bulka: China still harvests organs from prisoners – and the world does little to stop it” was published in the Ottawa Citizen on July 5, 2019.  The commentary was authored by Rabbi Dr. Reuven P. Bulka, C.M., a Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation Machzikei Hadas in Ottawa and past chair of the Trillium Gift of Life Network.  The commentary opened with, “First, they denied. Then, they said they would stop it. Now, it turns out that they never did stop it. The ugly, murderous practice continues unchecked.”  Bulka wrote that Chinese authorities are harvesting organs from political prisoners, primarily Falun Gong practitioners, to sell to people who need organ transplant surgery.  “This is murder, brutal murder: taking organs from the bodies of live people, because those organs are the freshest and best. Even though there was irrefutable evidence this was happening, the Chinese authorities denied it. This heinous practice was originally called out by Canadians David Matas and David Kilgour in their famous report of their painstaking research,” he wrote.   Rabbi Dr. Reuven P. Bulka  He described how the Chinese authorities had repeatedly denied they were committing these organ harvesting crimes, and then in 2014 incriminated themselves by announcing they would soon stop the practice of taking organs from executed prisoners.  “They thereby revealed that they are liars as well as murderers. No surprise that murderers are also liars. If life is cheap, the truth is even cheaper,” Bulka wrote.  “It is mind-boggling to think that the civilized ‘world’ applauded, rather than calling out the Chinese government and demanding they stop the murders immediately rather than eventually. That remains a truly horrible stain."  He wrote that based on the report from the China Tribunal that was held in London recently, the Chinese authorities are still committing these crimes. He said it was strange that the Tribunal's findings were not prominently reported in Western media.  He referred to the “painfully graphic statement” of the chair of the China Tribunal, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, that appeared on June 17 in The Guardian: “The conclusion shows that very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason, that more may suffer in similar ways and that all of us live on a planet where extreme wickedness may be found in the power of those, for the time being, running a country with one of the oldest civilizations known to modern man.”  Bulka referred to available statistics about organ transplants in China, whereby 90,000 transplants are said to take place every year, and the waiting time for an organ is just a few weeks. He said patients are also given assurance that a backup organ will be available if the original organ is rejected by the patient's body. “That is the reality in China, and, as Matas and Kilgour correctly pointed out, can only be explained as resulting from the murders of readily available 'prisoners' – mostly members of the Falun Gong, but including Tibetans, Uighur Muslims and Christian sects,” he wrote.  He wrote that the Chinese Embassy in London issued a predicable response to the allegations: “The Chinese government always follows the World Health Organization’s guiding principles on human organ transplant, and has strengthened its management on organ transplant … providing that human organ donation must be done voluntarily and gratis …”
Why did I find Ned super hot in that dress?  ...am I into goths?
Ned with a mustache is more important than anything in the existence of every one and every thing
That Keith impression tho. It's like he never left.
*Angsty Teen has entered the chat*
8:39 That was the gayest most adorable "oh no" hand movement/facial expression and I AM LIVING FOR IT   ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
13:08 TikTok Teens and Kpop Stans let’s make it happen.
Yo, why she look at him like that tho 31:10
I'm having war flashbacks to making cosplays for comic con
Highlights for me: Ned’s She Was a Skater Boy moment The abuelita housedress and Eugene somehow knowing the look? Lmao Eugene saying the word “non-binary “ had my enby ass like 💥👄💥?! Also Kelsey looked absolutely gorgeous
My name is Mimi so I felt honored having a dress named after me😂
Now I want the try guys to create a book/short story in a month....
GAY boys
As a costume designer and sewist, I love these sewing videos, but I wish more value was put into actually sewing. Maybe if they had more time. Wearability is pretty much negated if it’s going to fall apart as you wear it for any extended amount of time
Ngl, Zach was looking real offended. He really didn’t know what he was doing 😭😭😭 you’ll do better next time ❤️
eugene said: they
I agree with those rankings aha. Ned and Eugene were so close for me. Like, i knew Ned's was gonna slay. His was _mwah_ Yk? But I couldn't really hell what Eugenes looked like. But then I was stunned into silence. Like... I screamed so loud. I was like "Eugene SNAPPED" and my brother had to tell me to calm down and be quiet. Like, I wouldn't wear Eugene's dress. But I cannot lie when I see a good piece of clothing. Same with Ned's honestly. He pulled so much off. Like dang. That was s t u n n i n g. Like honestly, I would wear Ned's more then Eugene's. All the E F F O RT? Everything that was put into it? Amazing. Like....I honestly expected him to win. But I'm not even mad that Eugene won.
this sucks because Ned had the best look by far, it's the best he's done on any project ever, and he worked so so so hard on it (he hammered in eyelets!) but eugene's won because it was something straight off a runway. it was innovative not just for the try guys but for fashion in general. that said, ned, my baby, if you see this, you deserved the win <3
I haven’t seen the results, but Eugene has already won by referencing the new look silhouette, which is also one of my favorites
All the female audience finding Kelsey annoying. Lol   She's dope
Kelsey: What kind of dress do you think Keith would be making? Keith: Daddy's Favorite
Kelsey’s entire presence on this episode is channeling the most chaotic energy and I’m here for it
Oh great an episode without a Keith outburst... Nope nevermind   Without instructions wouldn't be the same without them 🤣
Shitty that eugene is back and taking himself too seriously as always
so we not gonna talk about neds subtle vote blue outfit?? because yes
I absolutely love Eugene but I think Ned won this one.
Roman can you pretty please remake Eugene's dress?
Tbh eugene is overrated
It's so refreshing to hear them speaking about measurements with no negativity. When they yelled "40!!!" with no disappointment, it was really refreshing
I wouldn’t have done any better than Zach, my generations wold be disappointed lol.
UMMMM my grandmother made me curtains with VERY SIMILAR fabric as Zacks dress.. sorry zack
Ned should have won.  Also his back is very attractive. LOL  I had to pause at 22:44 to show appreciation.
Zach and Kelsey have amazing energy
Before I even started this episode I knew Eugene was going to fuckin nail it. 💜
Roman was being rude to Zach and I don’t appreciate it lol
Can we actually get Eugene's dress made into a sellable garment though? I would 100% wear that design
Immediately after seeing everyones end procuct and before seeing the results I'd just like to say Ned absolutely deserves the win his was SO well put together.
So where can I buy Eugene's dress hahaha
can the TRYGUYS make hoodies without instructions? 👀😯
I need 7 more subs to 150 please guys lets get it <3
I tried making dresses once.    They all came out looking like trashy lingerie?
The way he said corset 💀
Kelsey: What kind of dress would Keith make? Me: Daddy’s favorite
Eugene: *making a dress for his mom Me: So what you're saying is you're making a Mommy's Favorite
Ned totally won. I do not understand.
Ok but like Roman's outfit! He slayed that corset 😍
Eugene is just always the best at everything ~
Zacks dress looks so comfortable
What’s the song at 29:50  LIKE PLEASE I NEED TO NOW!!
How is Eugene the only gay one?
Okay one thing I kinda wanna question are these fabrics all the same? Like cotton, or spandex or flannel because if they’re different it will cause a different skill level to sew each because of the different qualities. Also I don’t know much about juki but brother machines are kinda shit and I have a feeling by the look of the jukis they look older and their motors will have more power to get through the layers of fabric sorry I work in a sewing shop and know a bit to much
I love them all but ned was robbed!
I completely agree with the placing except for Zach. He should have gotten 3rd. My bisabuela loves that dress XD
Fucking Eugene!!  I love the backless dress with a pretty cape ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
Why was Kelsey so mean to Ned?
I don't wear dresses because d y s p h o r i a, but Eugene's dress, I might just wear. And ned's dress, if it had shoulders, I would wear as well. Now, Zach, my bisabuela wears that dress. So you know I'm here for it. And that sundress. Too happy for my liking. But I could see one of my friends wearing it.
Do they not know about Femboy Friday?
Kelsey should be in more vidssss she’s so funny
Wow I hate her attitude 👎🏼 Ned impressed me 😄
Insta coach Zach is everything 😍
Give a like if you believe they are gay
I’ve watched 2 videos in a row of the try guys dressing in women’s dresses
Kelsey: “ like if zack wins?!” Zach: “don’t worry about it”🥺🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Put Kelsey in more videos shes freaking hilarious. BUT CAN NED, EUGENE, AND ZACH PUT THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS IN THEIR DRESSES!!!! Imagine Maggie in that miimii PLEASEE
Kelsey: “I’m using the crack in the floor as a guid” Also Kelsey: “That’s what I said the first time I smoked meth” 🤦🏻‍♀️ wow.....so classy
I get that u guys are lgbtq+ allies, as u should. But I feel like the try guys stopped being Herero all together. I just don’t understand why it’s like full force with the femininity?
The judges were so hard 😭 like y’all...  keep in mind there was a time constraint who cares if there’s glue it’s MAKE a dress not sew a dress 😂😂😂
55    8  ure uttered 8 9 9mwell.9.9657 87 88ppm74 ☆*&)
Anyone want to buy Ned’s? I want Ned’s. I love it.
Y’all when Ned held up his dress after making the corset and attaching the bottom? I was like why does that look so fucking good tho
So can I actually buy Eugene’s dress please??
I don’t like the girl Keith
I felt zack awkwardness while he posing... and same
NED SHOULD HAVE WON 🏆 😪
I have seen Zack's look on several women in nursing homes. I loved Eugene and Ned's looks.
Kelsey looked in her element  in her sundress. Hot.
i want neds
Zach sewing the arms shut is the most Zach thing to ever happen. 😂
Spooky cottagecore is called Goblincore
Add one point I thought all of them were flirting with Kelsey. But nah, they’re just treating her like one of the guys.
So uh
Zach, is the best!
Can we NEVER have Kelsey on again? She's so unbearable!
The real reason Keith isn't in this video : "So what do you call this dress?" "Daddies favorite" "...."
Did you know that POTUS Trump still has a chance to win in Arizona? Check it out for yourselves.
I disliked this video purely because of the Asian guy's face.
Has Kelsey had her lips done?
Ned’s dress was so good though!!!!😢
i loved eugine’s, but i really wanted ned’s to win
zach looks like a grandma excited for his grandbabies to eat cookies that he baked
Ned did the best
Where are the captions ? :/
I want to see a show about the actual designers fixing these dresses
Lady Gaga could where Eugene’s outfit at the Grammys.
Oh Zach. .. . honey . .. .
I love Kelsey so much
Love Kelsey!! Have her on to eat more cheese. 🧀
ok but... zachs was better than both Neds and Kelseys.. and we all know it
It was so cool to see Kelsey!!
Zack looks like Homer in a really old episode of the Simpsons where he got so fat he could only wear this exact dress
I liked Eugene’s dress, but Ned’s dress was much more creative and the fact that he made a literal corset is impressive.
I miss watching try guys.. its been a year I last watched try guys
This man out here judging fashion while wearing a corset over jeans,,,
Ned's shoulders....🤤
I... really like the mustache.
i missed kelsey.. and wow her face is not moving, chill with the botox girl...✌✌✌✌ but u do u❤
Ned was robbed once again!
NED WAS ROBBED    (I love Eugene and his dress, but it was Ned’s turn today)
Kelsey’s “Keith-reaction” was so spot on 😅
I like Ned's dress the best. Great work dudes!!
Ok so I love Ned in a dress.
I love Kelsey and Eugene being competitive but still supportive
Keith is daddys favorite and Eugene is mommys favorite
Ned did so much more he did a corset and boning he should have gotten first eugene missed an entire edge. Kelsys is extremely cute and so different i love it but ned is my style too
Idk about y'all but Ned's drop waist WORKS with that chain
"i didn't know we could put a wig on" and other competitive quips from kelsey!
overlay. ned is love! kurt would be proud
I’m distracted by moustache. Ned is zaddy!
Respect to Eugene but they're wrong. Ned used different fabrics, belt material, different fasteners. Maybe wasn't precise with the measurements as Eugene, but Eugene gave us nothing more than what he's shown in the past. Like the pants episode, his creativity just didn't feel there.
sound of music vacation lol
Can I buy neds dress
The back of Eugene's dress was so well done.
Wait but I would actually love to buy the dress that Eugene made!!!! 😍
turns out I need to know where Kelsey got her pink jumper
Okay yeah eugenes dress was cool af but ned was fuckn ROBBED  This man put so much work in and his dress was so much more creative than eugenes plus did you see how confident it make him?? Straight up I thought ned was a shoe in and Eugene a close second, cannot believe this poor man hammered shit and still didn’t win 😭
I like Kelsey’s dress! I would wear it if it was well constructed!
I love Eugene and of course he looked sexy AF per usual, but how did Ned not win? Boning, multiple fabrics that look STUNNING together, a design that is flattering and clear... how
NED WAS ROBBED!!!
I love Eugene’s dress but with the hood up he looks like the sexy version of Zach’s “I’m the clitorus!” Moment
Eugene: making dress for his mom  No one:  Me: MOMMYS FAVORITE!😂
So, did Kelsie ever try on Eugene’s dress?
THE TRY GUYS TRY WEDDING DRESSES CHEAP THEN EXPENSIVE
I can't seem to get subtitles, but at 8:49 does Kelsey say "that is what I said the first time I smoked meth?" Honest question since I am having a hard time hearing her in this time stamp.
69 55555555
I think Ned win here.
Eugene is the Manhwa rich, hot mom 💁🏻‍♀️
Why does Kelsey look so different?
cinched. but i love "every bitch loves a sundress"
Man I wish you would leave Zach out of the videos or at least don’t film him talking
“If I can’t sew a dress, I’ll hammer it.”  -Ned Fulmer
Kelsey should be an honorary try guy!!!
Lmao "Zach!  Stop trying to make fetch happen"
As a sewer this is my favourite try guys competition video. Ned nailed it.
I'm super impressed, but also not all the way through the video yet.   Edit: Kelsey's was great in theory, if someone who knew what they were doing, did it, would have been wonderful.  Zach: he's so adorable, I can't be mean.  Ned: not bad. He had fun! And i'm glad he had a vision and went with it. I would probably wear this but make adjustments. Fishnet stockings, leather jacket, combat boots.  Eugene: are we not surprised? Always an over achiever. This is amazing.
Zach was the only one who attempted sleeves and I’m really proud of him for that. Sleeves can be difficult. Also, I’m really here for the costume designer’s unshaven legs. I don’t shave mine either. It’s a waste of money and fills landfills with plastic
I'm genuinely excited to see them retry this at some point (and bring Kelsey back, obviously)
all that math but where's the pleats
21:58 the TEXAN in Eugene jumped out
Ned should have won :(
i love avril
I think we can all agree Ned looked HOT while he was focused on his dress
"Has the mustache gotten normal yet...for you?"  Ned, 5 seconds in inaccepted it lmao. I wouldn't question it if he came on with mutton chops lmao
NED WAS ROBBED
Bruh Eugene pulls of being a girl better than I do. Like he killed in that dress and he looked so good.
ya know maybe zach is on to something, boys in skirts is already a thing on tiktok so😼
OMG Zach sewed the sleeves shut LMAO
I'm sorry but Eugene dress makes me think of the handmaid's tale
"thank you for believing in my queerness"
Ned's arms tho
Ned should've won because his construction, technical ambition, and creativity were superior to Eugene's. He did boning and boning channels, grommets, 3 different fabrics, and added decoration. AND it was the punk aesthetic he set out to make. Even the double sided tape went with the aesthetic. Eugene made a funky shaped tube with an ass zipper and a hood, and his cowl neck was too stiff. Eugene got nowhere near Dior's New Look like he intended. I love Eugene, but he didn't deserve the win on this one. Most of the time he does, but not this one.
Can I just say: Dammnnnn Eugene woahh
ned should have won.
Just wanna talk about the diversity of the judges. It is so great that you guys take representativity seriously and put minorities in high positions!! As a brazilian, it makes my heart very warm, I always feel at home watching your videos ❤
UGH ILOVE ROMAN
Zach: dudes in dresses make it happen Me: Harry Styles already did that😂😂😂
"Has the moustache got normal yet?" Me: *shakes head at phone*
“Every bitch loves a sundress” TRUE
Today I learned that I have the same size butt as Ned
I love how Eugene is so encouraging to everyone.  Good job guys!
More Kelsey please!!!
EUGENE VS. NED IS SO CLOSE, THE ANXIETY REMINDS ME OF THE FRIGGIN ELECTION GOING ON!!!!
I think we can all agree the age for genderless clothing is here. And the Try Guys aren't afraid to put that into motion!
Y’all would make dresses and try them on🤢🤮
Last time I didn't something like this was when I was in 6th grade making pillows. I'm now a senior in high school...
Eugene is just SO SWEET to all his friends
Zack they are theyre doing their best guys in skirts
Ned... * takes a deep breath *  Ned...  You are one fine creature.  Wait Ned didn't WIN?!?!?
I love dresses with built in hoods and capes, please make this a thing
I’m interested to see if Eugene does this Dior New Look right, currently I’m sewing a 1949 winter wardrobe 😊 it’s very easy for me though, I have authentic 1940s patterns from ebay lol  THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA 1930s-50s patterns are very hard to figure out, I want there to be “the try guys try to sew using a vintage pattern WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS !!!
Ned won to me
Wow, DIY girl, she really missed that opportunity to say "cape-abilities" when talking about Eugene's dress at the end.
Kelsey is the funniest try guy
Neddie Izzard
Personally, I thought Ned’s should be first. I like the silhouette Eugene was going for, the new look (late 1940s to 1950s style), but the finished dress didn’t really look like that as much as I thought it should. I do like the dress, but it just didn’t really meet my expectations.
Kelsey was actually like Keith to me
BRO I NED AND WAS LIKE WOAH HE HASS A SECRET FRENCH TWIN?!
ned looks amazing fight me lol and eugene is an absolute stunna!
Haven't been here for awhile and Zach's hair is looking thicker
Which brand of sewing machine was easiest to kill?
Ned you were so robbed I'm sorry :/// (as an ex-emo kid, current.... well, emo adult,  the dress is everything I hate about hot topic, but he managed to conjure from scratch everything I hate about hot topic in a matter of hours. DIY king!!! )
NeD wAs RoBbEd!
Kelsey was hilarious!
Ned does not give me nirvana vibes but i'm here for it regardless
zach and kelsey taking instagram photos was so cute omg
Kelseys manspreading more than the "guys"
Wish this hadn’t been ruined by Kelsey. I’ll wait for the next video.
“A moo moo for me me”😂😂😂
Glad to see Kelsey is doing well! <3
oh zach. dudes in dresses i s the thing
This is off topic but am I the only one that wants to see the try guys go on omegle
Kelsey was great omg I love her energy
NED TAKING FASHION RISKS MY HEART CANT TAKE IT 🥺
@Eugene!!!  i can't find good androgynous items for the male physique....   any tips??
This episode was so cute! I recently got into sewing so this was especially exciting to watch
Hii everyone  Visit my ... And love u all💕💕
Kelsey's so cute & funny im crying
ZACH GUYS IN MAID DRESSES ARE IN !!
15:15 where did neds pants go?????
Omg..... I just discovered that my butt is bigger than Ned’s butt
I’m weirdly attracted to Neds mustache
NED WAS FLIPPING ROBBED
Making a outfit is hard work. I only just got a sowing machine so am used to doing that by hand. Ive been making a crow fursuit for me.
Just proves they are soy boys
i am so shocked for the last dress. It is so creative and so amazing !!!!!!!! I love it!
The moustache is perfect, Ned.
Can we all just appreciate Eugene.      🎷🐛✨
Kelsey as Keith is premium content. Let’s get more Kelsey, y’all.
Legit, I would buy the dress Eugene made. I have a lipstick that color. I'm in love.
Zach was talking about guys in dresses.... does he know that weebs are making guys wear skirts and maid outfits😃
I have never heard of a sundress and I never wear dresses
Hahahahaha Kelsy she should be in more often.
NED WAS ROBBED
Kelsey absolutely channeled Keith and made Daddy's favorite. Those colors, the picnic feel, the pockets that do nothing (Keith's pants straps), third place freakout. She did him right.
If Eugene's dress gets onto the market- I'm buying it no matter the price
Did Kelsey get a nose job? She looks slightly different
13:08, you know what Zach you're right. Make and wear your own maid dress. Hop on the new trend and wow us. I have faith in you.
Maybe that's my punk side talking but Ned absolutely deserved to win this!
Kelsey is a very good Keith.
NED!! THOSE SHOULDERS!!! HOT DAMN
Kelsey seemed like she was trying to much tbh.. also dude she sounds like Drew Barrymore 🤔 Edit: Yeah she’s just annoying to me 😬
wait.. zach doesn’t know about boys in skirts? femme boys are very popular rn
Next video try guys make jumpsuits without instructions.
I think in the end the two professionals should have recreated the dresses
I didnt expect this to be 30 minutes long
😂😂I said to myself so many times that you have to measure the following:  Shoulder width Waist Hips Leg length Arm length  Chest AND SEEM ALLOWANCE!!!!  😂😂😂😂
Ayy Kinetic Cosplay!
i dont do the tv watching anymore but this makes me want to watch more project runway :P
omg Kelsy is like a babe <3 love her so much
i would love another one about dresses!!!
13:13 I think tik tok is going to do that for you. We are already at dudes in maid dresses.
I think I have to agree with Zach here. Guys in dresses? A m a z i n g
i loved all the dresses!
Woooow! euGEEEENE! I want his dress!
I love the Kelsey energy in Try Guys Videos.  Please have Kelsey more often!
I actually liked Kelsey's the best and Eugene's the least. Zach gets effort points.
its funny cuz tiktok really made guys in (maid) dresses the new hot thing, zach was ahead of his time
Ned should have won this one....his dress was FAR more impressive and creative and had SO MUCH done with love in such little time.
You did Ned dirty! His was the best, most cohesive look!
Kelsey had the best design but because of her execution of it she deserved third
full throtle fulmer dominated this 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
We need a girl on this try guys team, she is perfect for the job!!!
Can someone buy me food I havent eaten for 2 days and I dont have money please thanks❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kelsey's dress looks like the tablecloth on your grandma's kitchen table. Eugene's has that "club singer who's reluctantly dating a mobster" vibe, Ned's literally looks like something Avril Lavigne wore and Zach looks like a grandma.
this is the best episode
awh man they should of had micarah tewers as one of the judges.
I have a question for someone in the USA cause there's something I don't understand and can't stop thinking about. How does the law allow people to be togerther in the same room without masks when they don't live together? I don't mean it negatively towards anyone in the video, I'm sure they are following local restrictions, I'm just genuinely curious, since my coutry's situation is much better than in the USA and this would definitely not be allowed here. What  came to my mind at first was that they were far away from each other (which they were at the beggining) but then they sat next to each other in the end. Another thing that I thought of was that they all got tested and it came out negative, but that just wouldn't prove anything cause 1) they could have gotten infected right after the tests 2) covid doesn't show itself immediately when you get it, so if you caught it day before the test, it would probably come out negative and 3) it was discovered that up to 10% of positive people can get negative results, because the tests aren't always done properly (which is why negative results don't give you any privilege in my country) I definitely don't blame the Try Guys or anyone else in this video for being there together, because I'm sure that they wouldn't do anything that is against the restrictions, I'm just surprised that the USA, which is the most infected country in the whole world, doesn't have stricter rules
This video is just so goof
Where did Kelsey get her romper??
Whoever is Reading this: Your skin isn't a paper don't cut it Your body isn't a book don't judge it Your heart isn't a door don't lock it You're beautiful Your life isn't a movie dont end it it Be you.. Stay safe (by the way I'm also a small youtuber looking for your support) I didn't create this quote I just wanna spread positivity
Eugene always throws everything he's got into these competitions.
I KNEW Eugen's would be fabulous. That color is amazing too!
Kelsey was delightful to have in this ep!
Ned's moustache is giving me full on Grand Budapest Hotel vibes 😂
"Hi, I'm a self-healing cutting mat!" Ned: "OK good because I need to drive some nails into you." "Wait."
keith- I mean kelsey and zach taking pictures is my favorite duo moment
I would definitely wear Kelsey's dress, if I could figure out how to get into it.
NED!!!! OH MY GOSH 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 HOT FIRE FLAMES
"Say something Keith-like."  And then she just completely destroys Keith. It's like watching Goku pick up a glass while he's Super Saiyan, and the thing just shatters in his hand.
Love watching these guy grow. Eugene: Time management Ned: getting out of his shell
I loved the concept of Eugene's dress but the way it was made just looked like someone took a large piece of fleece and pinned them on a form to see if they liked the general idea... it was just too not there yet and this was the type of dress that needs to be perfectly finished or it's just doesn't look as good Ned should have won
zach’s dress looks like my lola’s housedress that she wears to sleep and to cook🥺🥺🥺
If you watch RPDR... you know the real tea of making a dress 😅
Could y'all maybe include disclaimers about having been tested or reasonings behind lack of masks/distancing? I know a lot of younger people are just tired of all that and getting lax, which is causing some big influxes of cases in places like college towns where I live, so just getting that little reminder in things like this about how important everything still is to keep in mind would be great.
Ned and Kelsey: measure their butts  Me: scrambles for a tape measure to compare
I agree that Ned’s dress looked nice but I do not think he should’ve won. Eugene actually sewed his entire dress while Ned used tape on some parts.
Eugene? Really? Ned was robbed.
Ok normally I really like Kelsey but having her in this episode was weird. She was non committal and kind of spacey... maybe she was just high idk.
Project runway is SHAKING
Eugene: "I like robes and capes; I wish I could wear more dresses."  Zach:"I want as little clothing between me and the outside world as possible"..... You guys know kilts are a thing, right?
As a seamstress I love hate these sewing without instruction videos 😂😂😂 I specialize in dresses and im like LET ME HELP YOU 😂😂😂 please lolol
Living for Ned’s mustache
I love Kelsey in this <3
3 hours is only enough time to make a dress if you actually know what you're doing. Beginners like us need days. Although if I did have to make one in 3 hours I would have gone with the simplest and oldest dress design across multiple cultures around the world: a tunic. Maybe dress it up by making belt loops.
Ooh that’s hard to do regular
Ned's dress is #1 in my heart 😭
NED SHOULD HAVE WONNNN
This made me so happy, adorable, so good, phenomenal, loved it. xoxo
This was fun! I really thought that Ned was going to pull out a win rather than Eugene winning all the time. But Eugene's dress was so elegant and look like it could be walking a Runway or laced walking down the street where as most of the others did not. I do, however, I applaud Ned for so incredibly much work on that outfit. I was so proud of you with the corset assembly! I think that Ned did the most in terms of design and execution but for overall looks, I would probably give it to Eugene
Tiktok is making boys in skirts and made outfits popular so were almost there Zach
i loved eugene’s dress but i think it’s just caused his dress fit him and his personality/ look , which is the only reason why it looked so good on him. i personally think ned should’ve won that, he KILLED it and if some certain model wore it, or if ned added mroe accesories to it like eugene did in the runway, then ned 100% ATE
Zach made a granny dress
Idk about you but those look super cute imo
Zach's dress introduction is the funniest shit ever... I love him 20:22 "This look was originally inspired by a momo, then it turned out I don't know what a momo is..."
KELSEY!!!! 💖
Wait everyone be quiet for a second...  I can't hear any serious music, drastic accusations, or the sound of politicians trash talking their opponent.  *The reign of political ads has finally ended*
After this, I could see Eugene making his outfits for Cheyenne Pepper.
Ned should have won! Looks like he puts so much more effort in this than the rest. I am kind of dissapointed that he didn’t win.
Does Ned have any body hair? His skin looks baby smooth 😆 Hey Ned, I dig the mustache, I think you should have won because you worked so hard and you really made it a personal piece and it wasn’t bad it was a dress made for a man for sure!
noooo i hated eugene's omg, ned was robbed
Zach still clinging on to that last homer strand
Loved Eugene's  Have a V cut in the front instead of squared, make it black... I want!!!! lol.
Honestly I missed Keith but Kelsey is so fucking funny she needs to be In more videos with you guys just with Keith
BOOOO Ned should have won. All the embellishments he added plus making his own “pattern” on the bodice??? BOOOOO I demand a re count. XD
Okay video suggestion try guys try knitting.
Eugene’s comment on Zach’s dress is the most accurate one cause I was thinking the exact same thing as a Mexican 😂😂
:O I had no clue Ned liked Nirvana!
Now that ned has finally started to look like a dad.  My brain- OMG HOT!
Ned with a moustache? *Chefs kiss*
Nah, I love Eugene but Ned should've won.
I’m not a fan of Ned’s mustache
I wonder how the costume designer feels   seeing all that fabric get abused
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)
How the frik does Kelsey imitate Keith so perfectly
As a person who sews watching these is so cathartic because every sewer has been through these moments of dispare 😂
Tiktok teens or kpop stans, you have the power to do anything, make this happen XD 🥰🥰😂😂
True story *Mom walks in* Mom: "what are you watching?" Me: " I'm watching 30 year old men fail to make dresses" Mom: ...wha
I LOVED Eugene’s creation but in my heart Ned is the true winner!! He did such an amazing job, was so proud of his creation, so proud and so so happy to try it on!!! What a wholesome moment, really!! I also would totally wear Zack’s mimi dress at home! Looks very comfy!
In the spirit of Zach's Jewish forefathers, I have only one thing to say about the dressmaking process, and most of the dresses, in this video:  Oy vey.
kelsey's angry keith impression was pretty spot on
God I love Kelsey. She's my favorite person.
NED WAS ROBBED!!
So proud of your work Ned! To me you won! Yes Eugenes was a look but all of Neds details/efforts and especially the confidence he radiated in his catwalk was what won me over! Great episode I’m loving this design/fashion series!
Also, can we appreciate that Kelsey's dress had blue-squares?  That's some OG Keith content
Congrats to Karlie Kloss for making a cameo lol
I love Kelsey in this
5:03  daddy's favorite, DUH xD
"What if Zach actually won?" — "Then the patriarchy wins" as well as Zach's sentiment of making dresses for a men a thing... I love it, I'm here for it. I know that outside the Western world, men also wear dresses or clothes comparable to dresses, but I wish it would become a thing here without appropriating other cultures
lol @ zach telling kpop fans t make dudes in dresses lik BTS havent been wearing them and skirts for the last 10 years. Yoongi literaly wore a beautiful grey dress just a few weeks ago for the ON concert short films
my name is mimi so it was very wild hearing my name numerous times during this vid... thank you zach i am honoured
When did Ned get so muscular?
Why was I ready to read the title like "Making dresses without a recipe" 💀🖐️
Ned's bod!   0o0
Dresses aside, Kelsey's Keith impression was pretty good
I love Ned's dress, he was robbed for sure
I love Kelsey
Visual proof that Eugene makes everything look hot
Ned really deserved first He made a functional lacing at the back, he used multiple fabrics, added accents and accessories to top.
Zach: dudes in dresses  Tiktok teens: *dudes in school girl skirts and maid outfits* Also tiktok teens: ur late
I would buy Nedss dress if he ever took off making his own dresses. Zack's I loved it was freaking adorable. Kelsey's dress wouldve been perfect if it had actual pockets. Eugene's dress is pretty but I wouldn't wear it personally.
Idk what it was but Kelsy was so obnoxious the whole video. Just trying way too hard to be flirty and sexy and vulgar. Really didn't like that. Would have loved keith to be there
Eugene's dress was the only real dress. Yes Ned was nice but it wasn't a dress. It was a corset with a skirt and the corset wasn't even finished.
Ok but why is Eugene's dress good. Like fix some small detail and get it done by a professional and it a look
OMG Eugene should have a non binary clothing brand - i'd totally buy from him
SOYBOY
We need another drinking episode with Eugene and Kelsey!!
Kelsey’s butt is smaller than Ned’s, she just has hips that make the circumference the same.
Did anyone else think that Kelsey booking a vacation for everyone to see, in the midst of a global pandemic, when hundreds of thousands have died and case counts in the U.S. are only going up, was super tone-deaf? I'd happily not see her in a video again.
That was so Keith 😂😂😂😂
Watching this video makes me so much more confident in my sewing abilities
Zaddy....
OMG LOVE NEDS LOOK!!!
Ned was robbed
I think eugene's shirt is inside out
ned shouldve won!!!
Kelsey and Zach are me asf when taking Instagram pictures 😂😂😂
Friends, I opened a youtube channel, I am posting mixed videos, I will be happy if there will be support
Mari is sooo pretty!! 🤩
Dudes in maid dresses are the new thing 😂
This was great. But now I want to see them make dresses with help!
I love Eugene but Ned was robbed
where did roman get this corset from? its so nice i need it
Ok but honestly Ned deserved that win. Like look at his dress!!!
ned with the MUSTACHE
These videos make me so jealous, not because they are having fun or anything, but because their sewing machine is way nicer than mine 😭
I’m sorry but I missed Kieth, kelsey was a bit annoying for me.
Zac hasn't stumbled upon femboys on tiktok yet
Ned was robbed for sure 😱
She's outrageous, I love her!
Neds dress gives me very Jenny Humphrey from Gossip Girl vibes
“dudes in dresses make it the next hot thing” us making maid dresses on guys a thing (:
I loved Kelsey in this, I hope we get to see more of her!!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️Non-Duality
ZACH WAS SO MADDDD
ned just know you’re the true winner. that corset man, nothing beats a corset moment
Ned was robbed! Eugene's dress is great but it was safe and I feel so bad for Ned :( he looked sad
suggestion for video...try foot peel masks.  These are really popular right now with people doing at-home pedicures during the pandemic.  Love your channel!
Eugene: intentially sabotages himself by not measuring anything & wins anyways
Worshipping the creation from my Fashion God of all Queerness - Eugene  But *NED WAS ROBBED* when he lost, creativity died!
I love how much of a mama's boy Eugene is. I hope my kids think about me this much when they're grown. <3
For me, style wise Ned's dress and comfort wise Zach's dress. There's no in between sorry.
ok i love kelsey
As it turns out mustache Ned is 100% my type welp
poor zach. he is not having a good time
Ned’s voice when he said “why would it be so bad if I won?” 🥺🥺
Pov: youve never seen to pretty best friends
can we PLEASE talk about how in RPDR Season 6 episode 1 Ben Dela Creme HOT GLUED herself into her dress and WON the sewing challenge? How come when Zack does it he gets fourth? The fabric was great, the ambition was THERE, he didn't give up even though he wasn't happy. The energy on the runway was incomparable. Don't get me wrong I love Eugene but his hood moment wasn't stronger than Zack's dress at all. I was bored by Eugene's monochrome look. It looked equally as unfinished as Zack's and Kelsey's. ALSO Ned took a HUGE risk and should have won. That boning? The fabrics? The hand drawn graffiti print? I've never wanted Ned to win more.
“if zach wins, then the patriarchy wins"
Glad that u guys are back....
At 18.25 I screamed POCKETS I love Kelsey so much
Dont get discouraged Ned, you did great sweetie👏🏼😂
NED WAS ROBBED
I’m so sad Ned didn’t win. He deserved this win! The dude included boning, eyelets, personal graffiti, metal detailing, fabric layering and it was all cohesive. Would it have been so bad if he won :(
Dudes in dresses ARE the hot thing on TikTok, just escape straight TikTok and you’re good 👌🏽👀
First I was 😯 Then I was ❤️ Now I'm  😂
I wish they had micarah tewers judging
Ned is giving me lowkey Freddie Mercury vibes.
Can someone explain the mumu meme thing to me. I don't get it?
when does eugene not win? that man can do no wrong although i kinda think ned should have had this one, it's insanely impressive
ned's moustache 👁 👄👁
Hello! wanted to share the gospel with you all, have a lovely day!   (As Christians we should spread Gods word) Mark 16: 15 15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  (God loved us so He allowed His only Son to die for our sins)  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”      Jesus Christ created only one church. And that is His church which is the (church of Christ.) (Not a (man made) church like: catholic, baptist, Muslim, Pentecostal, etc...) but His church is the only one you can read about in the Bible.  (Only one) Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.                                                Romans 16:16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.  And the members of the Lords church are called Christians.                                           Acts 11:26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.  In order to become a child of God one must obey the gospel which is  The plan of salvation  Hear: Romans 10:17  So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  (You have to hear the word)  Believe: Mark:16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.   (After you’ve herd the gospel, do you believe it?)  Repent: Luke 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  (If you believe, are you ready? to repent, (turn away) from the sinful ways of living?)  Confess: Matthew 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also  before my Father which is in heaven.  (After you’ve repented, do you confess that Jesus is the Son of God; the one who died for your sins?)  Be Baptized: Galatians 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  (After you’ve confessed are you ready? to put on Christ in baptism being   submerged in the water)  [And then we all must live faithful unto death]  Revelation 2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.      (Live a life striving to be like Christ, even though we as children fall constantly, keep your robes clean, by living a life of repentance not willingly sinning but, repentance is a gift from God to get it right when we do fall short because no one is perfect)   Exodus 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  HAVE A BLESSED TIME!😇
my first dress project when i was FD student was.. a sleeveless boat neck line with princess line top and box flared pleated skirt dress with big dropped bow attached at Center Back neckline, with CB invisible zipper :)  i stressed out but thank god i made it :)
i would actually buy a real version of kelsey’s dressed. the different layers of fabric, the leg slit, the body chain! i love it. and ned’s is fucking awesome omg you can tell he worked so hard on it and it was worth it.
That Kelsey is unnecessarily vulgar😝
6:30 I love Zach’s response to Kelsey 😂😂
I'm so sorry because Eugene really does look great but he came out with the wig and all I saw was a Mariah from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure cosplay
Don't have to wear underwear or a bra with a sundress! The lion, the witch, and the audicity of that bitch!
Is Kalsey Katherine Ryan??
Eugene was number #1 & Ned was #2
All these dresses are absolutely beautiful and they were all perfectly fitted for the „designers“, especially Zack is looking absolutely adorable!!
last time the judges said that Ned's project too bland and basic and that's why he didn't win, now he does this masterpiece bold and creative  but yet again Eugene wins
let automatic subtitles available please (it is for most of their videos but not this one)
Eugene walked straight out of the Witches
Everyone did a surprisingly good job! Like if a professional took the visual design of the dresses they could all be sold in a store. Like, even Zach’s mimi could be worn by a Cuban nana. But legit, the top 3 designs were super cute!
woah! It's been long since I saw Kelsey on buzzfeed! she must have had a nose job and lip fillers or somethin..? Nonetheless she's gorgeous
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💐💝😄
I was so surprised by how much of an understanding Ned had for how clothing works. Out of everyone I think he nailed the construction and technical details the most. He looked so in his element here, like he could have a future career in fashion design haha
How DARE you post alternative rock music in a video about making dresses!
Ariel dressed Ned today with that bandana
Please have Kelsey join in more stuff! That was fun!!
destroying toxic masculinity as they should 💅
I wanna see Ariel try on Ned's dress!
Are you sure you don't want to make a dress, Keith? lol
They love posting feminine content, genius or flamboyant? You be the JUDGE.
as a fashion designer, i personally liked ned's dress more bc it is way for unique and more of the current time
Yay, Romans back!!!!
i just started but no shade or ugliness but what happened to kelsey maybe makeup change but she looks so pinched ..oooooooohhhhh yall did that because she came to win...my girl
6:32 Zach's "don't worry about it" needs to be my life mantra
Turn on comments for your Biden video Soy Boys
Wait until Zach finds out that guys in Kpop are already wearing dresses
30:07 When Trump loses
Zach made a pillowcase first 😂
Too long to watch the whole thing at work, where was Keith??
Gay
Congratulations on 19th on trending guys been with you from the first video so proud :)
I was watching this last night and didn't finish it and at night I had a dream about the ending of the video
Keith isn’t here because there’s no Daddy’s Favorite dress
What kinda dress would Keith be making?  Daddy’s favorite 😏
Zac is a natural photographer
Love love love Kelsey's energy she looked so good in that dress, all of them did, all of them killed it 💕
Am I the only one who kinda wants to see Eugene in Ned's dress?
Kelsey casually quoting mean girls is the content i’m here👏🏼 for👏🏼
I'm definitely gonna need more Kelsey
This is the best all the guys ever did in a without instructions xD
Wait...Kelsey is TALL?
If Keith isn’t there, everything goes to shit.
Is it just me or is Ned with the mustache giving off the same vibes as Timmy, the bartender/ drag queen guy from the cut vids???
I am studying in fashion design, and this was a delightful video 😍
This is just every episode of drag race
Honestly, I would love to see them in a  Project Runway special 😂
Where’s Keith?!?
Kelsey is a relatable mood😂👌
also need to know where kelsey got that jumpsuit omg❤️
no ned was robbed i’m sorry
Kelsey made this video hard to watch. Sorry ‘bout it.
Why do people wear cloth mask .. it’s no protection in them
Can I just say that 1.  Zach was adorable in that dress. And 2. Neds dress was SO CREATIVE.
“Thank you... for believing in my queerness” I’m- stealing that
AMAZING video as always! adore lauren being there and the editing is really good
I am completely in love with Kelsey’s pink look. Like, bitch? Yasss with like three ‘s’s
Can someone explain to me how Ned hammered on the corset part?
was not prepared for Ned's back muscles at 22:44 , and I just... *claps*
Wow, Zach's outfit is fire in this vid.
WITHOUT A DRESS-IPE
Zach's dress really reminded me of my Nana which is nice
Ned's dress looks like something I would love to wear (If I only had more self confidence)
OK BUT ZACH TELLING GEN Z TO HYPE UP MEN IN DRESSES
Here's my millionth comment asking why y'all have given up on providing captioning for your deaf fans :(
I’m sorry Eugene but Ned should’ve won. dude made a whole corset with combination patterns and embellishments. Eugene just sewed fabric onto a plain dress and called it a hood 😂
This thirty minute video is really what I needed today🥰 But also these dresses are so cute and I wonna wear them soooo bad. I love dresses and skirts but look so bad in them😭 *Edit:* I want Ned and Eugene's dress on my person right this second. My personality lies somewhere between Ned and Eugene's dresses
ned: freddie mercury
Jesus Christ loves you all. Come to him today! He's coming very soon!! Sooner than you think! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Turn away from your sins. Believe on him and Trust him! The time is now!!! God Bless
Kelsey was clearly the female embodiment of Keith. Solid fill-in choice Try Fam! 😂
BRAZIL THINKS NED WAS ROBED
I was really excited for this video until I saw Keith wasn't in it. I never realized before how important he is to the dynamic for me. 🤔
I was literally saying “this is something my asian grandma would wear” when Eugene said ethnic nana 😂
NED WAS ROBBED
Eugene needs to come out with his own line of clothes
NED WAS ROBBED THE JUDGES SUCK
how did ned not win this? as good as eugene's look was it was just a single fabric and it was not creative at all, ned's construction was exquisite considering the time they had and he was really creative rigga morris girl!
ned was robbed. HE ADDED BONING. A CORSET BACK. Eugene's looked great but the effort, the concept, and the outcome of neds dress was outstanding with just 3 hours of working time
"Then the patriarchy wins" 😂😂😂 Eugeneeee
keith: daddy’s favorite for a few episodes in a row  meanwhile eugene: i think this is in honor of my mom  “that’s very sweet” “ugh i didn’t mean it to be sweet”
love the Try Guys version of Project Runway....:)
Kelsey’s impersonation of Keith is spot on👌🏼
Keith was great
zach: is constantly winging it and then is complaining as to how he fcked up ned: (desperately) trying to be a trendsetter or a person who brings back trends keith: has a strategy but doesnt know how to apply it eugene: "accidentally" good at everything
HOW DOES EUGENE MAKE EVERYTHING LOOK SO FLAWLESS?!?!?
The judges comments killed me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...... Find me in happy laughter🤣🤣 cemetery 👻👻
Im a 20 year old nana because I won like 6 of those ethnic nana dresses
Anyone else go to Kelsey's Insta to see the bombass pics Zach took?
Kelsey is inappropriate
At first I was sad Keith was absent... But Kelsey is amazing. Love her❤
Just found your show, I think I will love it! I notice you all have a lot of patience for measuring.
i didnt think their testosterone could get even lower...
Kelsey is so fun 😂😂 can y'all have her on the show again the the future??
Okay but can I like, buy Eugene's dress
Kelsies face looks so different personally I think she looked better before she changed herself
Ned should have won this one! Eugene look was beautiful, but unfinished compared to Ned. Ned's work deserved more praised.
i miss keith
But- Why no Keith😞
Dresses with pockets !
We need more Kelsey
i freaking love this video!! 😭😭💜💜
First I just want to say that my daughter and I love all of you, we watch you all the time. You've been the heroes of this pandemic in my book, keeping us thoroughly entertained. Second, Eugene that dress is fabulous, real Grace Jones vibes. Third, props to your team. This video is so well Made.  It looks stunning!
I know Eugene is the chosen one, and fully respect that, but I do feel like Ned was robbed. He put some much work and technique in! But I also love how happy he seemed with it in the end.
Lets make dudes in dress happen guys!!!!!!
i’m still a beginner seamstress/professional artist and I love creating things, it makes me so happy!
with that mustache and bandana, Ned looks like an old timey cowboy especially with the accent at 9:52
this was uploaded on my birthday lol
while Eugene's dress was being shown on the stand my first thought was I really hope it's gonna be an open back and I'm SO happy
Ned was the obvious winner in my opinion!
Now masks are fashionable lmao
Ned's dress was the best, hand's down.
I miss Keith.
No, wait, I think Zach is right about jazz
I took sewing in high school and know how hard it is to make ANYTHING, I’m so impressed honestly
Aww I was hoping I'd see Daddy's favorite dress lol.
I can not understand  this, what they are talking about?
So coool
Zach- next big thing dudes in dresses Kpop and tiktok- oh zach that's been a thing already. Femboys
Thank you for making this video because im literlly throwing together what supplies i have around to make a dress to wear to my brothers wedding. this is great
Can you make soap without instructions?
3:23 Art school in a nutshell 😆
@13:14 Zach made a pillowcase!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yt search; "Jesus the holy grail and the mushroom"
Kelsey: Like if Zach wins?? Zach: 🥴 don’t worry about it!
I don't know about the rest of you, but I want more Kelsey. That was all A+ comraderie/trash talkerie.
There is no caption :')
Please bring Kelsey into more videos. I never get tired of seeing her with the guys
I love Eugene but this win belonged to Ned. Eugene's dress looks good but the construction is very simple and with some va-va-voom, it's easy to pull off a drapey dress. Ned's dress, on the other hand, required exact measurements and painstaking sewing.
Kelsey’s dress was fun!! I’m not a strapless dress person but the “rustic” construction fits my weirdo vibe. Eugene’s dress is on par with something I’d see on Project Runway and I mean that in a good way! He’s so damn talented, I could see him designing clothing easily.
kelsey didnt even try
"tiktok teens, make dudes in dresses the next hot thing" they did bro
ned with a mustache is iconic
i honestly thought you could just put a piece of fabric over your body and then cut a hole for the head and arms
Zach: "dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing" Tiktok: *femboys in skirts and men in maid outfits* yes.
The moment Zach sewed the arms of the dress.. I was on the floor!!!! A dress with no arms...deaaaaddddd!!! I just loved it
No way! Ned really nailed it with that dress!! and smashed all qualification criterias. He deserved to win 👗
You should reach out to costubers for stuff like this too. They spend a lot of time studying and making clothes.
Why does Ned always end up missing clothes by the end of these videos lmao
Please add Kelsey to your try guys team!! I love her😍
ned looks good with the mustache!
ABSOLUTELY SCREAMING AT THE "VOTE" SHIRT
Zach looked like he was holding up a giant pillow case when he realized he had sewn the arms shut
Zach doesn't know it yet? Man in dresses are The Thing on tik tok💖💛
"social distance" when no one actually is in this video
ned got fucking robbed
Ned should've won :(
Kelsey's "easy to pee with" is basically "easy to do ✨ segs ✨ with"..... or maybe that's just me, sorry.
"thank you for believing in my queerness" i want this on a tshirt
Jesus loves you. He died for our sins and resurrected on the third day. The pay of sin is death. We need to repent from our sins and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. He is coming soon, we need to follow Jesus
Tan France and alexa Chung are crying
Ned got robbed; he totally should’ve won!
God Eugene is a phenomenally talented and beautiful human. I had some doubts when we couldn’t really see their endgame idea on the model but holy shiiiiit that reveal. Absolutely stunning. (Also using ‘they/their’ from now on until Eugene corrects it because they mentioned non-binary clothing in this video and I am NOT trying to disrespect my favorite Try ‘Guy’) pls someone correct me if I’m wrong.
Ever since they tested their testosterone Ive felt bad for these fuckers
U see me everywhere
Zach's delivery of "Don't worry about it" was perfect.
Kelsey is kinda an arsehole now. Shame.
Eugene looks like the evil mom in kdramas
Ned ruled 🤟
Come on judges! Ned's dress was way better!
Sewing is all about order of operations
Ned was robbed.
Anyone imagined a sad mummy when they heard ammumu at 3:10
Kelsey talking about smoking meth and going on vacation during a pandemic. Okay.
Ok. I loooooove that Kelsey was in this, like always love her so I'm not complaining, buuuuuuuut I think this means we need an exclusive Keith tries to make a dress without instructions.... I neeeed to know what he'd do, please please please🙏
Keep the stache
Sorry Eugene, but Ned should have won that one!
Wow, they found someone more annoying than Keith.
She had Keith SPOT ONN😂👌🏿
I WOULD WEAR EUGENE'S DRESS. SOOO HOT AND CLASS-Y
Kelsey its like the mean try guy xD
You guys should go to iFLY indoor skydiving!
Zachs outfit (before he puts on the dress) is really cute and stylish
yo, not popular opinion at all but eugenes dress was way too overrated and excited about. there’s plenty of dresses like that that’s already made and looks exactly like that, specially in movies. it’s a dress but not as good cut like the others. it’s basic. i liked Ned and Kelseys dresses more. Kelseys dress is in fashion rn and i would see plenty of famous teen or in their 20’s ppl wear it or models and insta ppl wear it. if her dress is fixed up it would sell. Ned is amazing imo but just needed some fix up and a female body to show it off honestly it was good. Eugene always usually do good. by now no ones surprise if eugene wins always. but ned and kelsey were ROBBED. i don’t get what was so great about eugenes dress but it’s only imo so :/ it’s not as unique as others. it was so overrated 💀 they spent like minutes talking & praising about a basic ass dress compared to seconds on the others like what?? the favoritism was there. Those judges was not fair. i say it’s RIGGED. everyone agrees it shoulda been Ned.
They were the right top two but seriously, Neds was so much better. Sorry Eugene
Ned got robbed
What Kelsey was in the video?? I thought that was Keith 😂😂😂. They should do making a shoe without instructions?? Or a wig???
ؑEugene cheated clearly. If we cut the gloves wigs and heels there is not much really, even the hood is sewn wrong
Dang, that Kelsey person is rude!
I just posted YouTube blog about buying our first house! The link is in my bio. I’m trying to do more things that bring me joy and it would mean the world if you checked it out! 🧡🖤
Kelsey's Keith impression: A+++. Top tier.  Also, Eugene's dress is gorgeous and amazing (as expected), but I'd have given the #1 spot to Ned for sheer creativity and all that he put into making a unique dress that made a bold statement. Awesome jobs all around, though!
is drunk sewing too much to ask for?
How about each of the try guys create a 3 piece collection and host a mini runaway where they will be juded by: Looks, Originality, Did it respect the theme, Is it a collection and the public would be us in the internet.
When they were judging zak at the 31 mark there was something walking behind them on there other side of the window. Was it a person or a sprite.
I'm eight and I have my own real machine 😏
Ned's was 1st place tho T^T
Heyy, you guys should do Try Wives/Partners try baking something without a recipe. 😁🤩
NED WAS ROBBED
just watch ned at 10:22
Am I the only one who thinks Ned looks like Freddie Mercury
Kelsey should visit more often
my booty is bigger than ned's his is 40 inches mine is 51 inches what am i meant to do w/ this information
I love zach 😂❤️ he is so fucking cute❤️
Where is Keith? ☹
This is rigged ... Ned's was the best ... GO NED GO .... Eugene could have never done what you did with that dress .
I desperately need to know where Kelsey's jumpsuit is from.
I actually want Eugene's dress cause DAYUUUUUMMNNNN
Ned was robbed of a win
Kelsey needs to be in more episodes 😂
zach: kpop stans can make anything  ;we cant make our faves appear in front of us
This ain’t fair. Eugene does this normally.
My grandma fr has Zach’s dress
It would be fun if they all had their dresses like properly made for them after. At least they have a vision for what they want
Yo Neds was my favorite
Loving all these videos with Lauren❤️
She said 2020 lol
Eugene is exactly right! Zach’s dress really did look like a grandma dress 😂
I'm actually so impressed with Ned, though. He did really well, and he was robbed goddamnit.
Here to support a fellow cosplayer 🥺
Eugene needs his own style line. That dress is gorgeous, classy yet modern, and sexy
Wait so kelsey made a mask and said “social distanced safe halloween” but had just been saying she was scheduling an vacation🤔
I don't know man.. For the first time zach made something which is actually what they were asked to make.. He did well.. He is growing up..
Ned should’ve won
Eugene’s dress was something you see in a magazine, but Ned did ribbing and a corseted back!
Lovin to see all this defence of Ned’s dress. He has won the public judgement, I feel.
Now I don’t feel bad for failing my sewing class because my teacher didn’t actually teach she spent all her time making my fellow classmates cry and babying the mentally unstable upper class men, instead of teaching.  Also I would so wear Ned’s dress
But like shout out to Ned- he was so proud of that dress and it rocked!
So does anyone else just actually hate Eugene’s? Like sorry Eugene but I do not understand why everyone seems so obsessed w it it was my least favorite
Kelsey is the 5th try person ❤️
I love crazy creative Ned. He's my favorite Ned.
Neds dress is heinous 😂
ZACH IS CUTE IN THAT DRESS 🥺
Zack's struggle with the material being too heavy and pulling off the table is so real. My grandma Andi just made my wedding dress and we had the same struggle
i LOVED Eugene's dress, it's so beautiful, elegant and extravagant but i also really really loved the way Ned got out of his comfort zone. and it brought back so many memories of my angsty emo years lol
so eugene won, is anyone surprised? xD
I think the deciding factor in Eugene getting first place is that Ned's dress, while technically more impressive, is a little dated. I look at it and immediately flash back to the 2000's Hot Topic Era. Pair it with a GIR bag, and some fingerless gloves, and it's exactly what middle/early high school me would've worn. Eugene's looks more grown up, overall, while still retaining an edgy vibe with the hood. HOWEVER, Ned was definitely more impressive with his techniques! The man did a corset, for fuck's sake. That's a lot of extra work, and he nailed it.
Kelsey not helping Zach out was sooooo funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
03:05 is a mean girl's refrenceee😂😂😂😂😂😂IM DYINGGG
Anyone else think the music was a bit too loud in this video??
I want to see a Without a Recipe/Instructions that Zach could win— how about ‘Try Guys Make Tea Blends?’
ok but as a kpop fan, zach, we made a lot of boy idols wear skirts and dresses so👀🤍
Ok not to be mean but Zach’s dress makes me think of a grandmas nightgown😅
That was an amazing episode😍😍😍. Can we get more like this?☺️ Like next you could try doing a purse or bing more exaggerated, doing like a gala outfit or dress🤩🤩. That could be so damn interesting🤣🤣🤣.
oh is ned growing a beard for movember
I would wear Eugene's dress! It was so beautiful 😍
Why in the world am I watching this lol
i loved ned's
Ned definitely won this round of Without Instructions.
Look I’m not going to lie... I stayed for Ned in his underwear 🤭
"dudes in dresses make it a hot thing "  o-ho i have some good news for you buddy
Ned wins imo.
I think that Zach is a little sad that everyone dismisses him so easily in the competition.
Eugene needs to make a maid dress
Who else missed Eugene's alcohol ???😀😀
I gotta say eugene slay every single creativity category in most without a recipe/instructions episode. He's result is literally out of my expectations. That plum dress blow my mind awayyy, so uniqiue. You can just put it in the fashion show  runway and no one will really doubt it.
Ned's outfit was very ambitious, but it did not flatter his body at all. It made him look incredibly boxy. If you're going to make a corset it needs to cinch the waist. Eugene knew his limitations, based on his knowledge, and made a dress you can wear multiple ways and play around with. He absolutely deserved to win.
Hw iS EuGenE sOo anNoyiNgly Great aT everYthing..
Neds is my favorite
this was basically a rpdr episode and i love every bit of it
i would love to have eugene's dress
In the credits it looks like Roman Sipe's name and youtube link are wrong.
I literally gasped when Eugene came out wearing his dress holy fuck he looks stunning and I love the dress so much
Kelsey what kind of dress would keith make Keith daddy’s favorite
Neds was top tier. Avril Lavigne is crying tears of joy.
Satan is a liar!!!! You gotta work, and spill blood, dance in circles .,to get anything.....even then....he cheats you out of it!  Laughing all the way!!!!  Dammed you to eternal darkness and separation from God!   Kill his fun!!!!;  Believe in the Son-JESUS!!!  Its not religion, its salvation, its just believing In Jesus.   Satan lied, said just 2 choices to everything , just like the tree!  Good or evil.  Oh !!!! But the true is .    ...... A third choice.....  The Tree of Life!!!!!!  Choose life.... Its free!!!  Choose JESUS!!!!!
MORE. KELSEY. ALL. THE. TIME.
Where can we buy Eugene's dress.  I WANT IT
Eugene looks like such a good boy in the thumbnail
Why is Ricegum in the thumbnail?
Ohhhhhh Eugene the new look is fabulous, but SO FUSSY to sew without a pattern
The weird thing is that I can imagine Keith wearing/making Kelsey's dress
What if , if one of the try guys are out they should always guest replace kelsey 🤣🤣🤣
Dresses are my favorite thing to sew. This video is hilarious!
Dang nobody be talking about how strong Neds back looks  I agree Ned was robbed
17:56.
Wait... Keith is a girl?
I absolutely love them all, and Eugene's is amazing. But even though I would likely choose Eugene's to wear myself, I think Ned stepped SO far out of his comfort zone, and made so many details and had the dress turn out exactly like my dream 2000's dress. Also he planned his a lot, and Eugene seemed to wing it without measuring (nothing wrong with that Eugene you're perfect). Ned should have won this one, but you all looked amazing. LOVE YOU ALL!
Non-binary merch pls
I'm so proud of ned
Zach reaction in the first video WTF   Zach's Reaction now WTF accually no its fine in used to it now
No closed captions yet! :( Edit: 12-12-2020  Finally captions are available.
Why does everyone seem so baked in this video except the professional seamstress-
Eugenes dress is a look but you can clearly see he doesn’t know how to construct a dress...
Ned’s mustache makes him look like that guy from project runway 😂
I can't stand Kelsey... she always talking the same shit and it's not even funny
I feel like Kelsey's impression of Keith was nearly perfect. The only thing missing was "daddy's favorite"
I knew Eugene was gonna win!
I love Kelsey’s energy in this
Keith would of helped our boi
Okay but Zach and Kelsey's friendship in this video can NOT be beat.
I love Kelsey and her energy. Love to see her more
Love Eugene but its Ned for me here
Whether one is aware of it or not, the whole of consciousness, the whole of what we call thought, is conflict- thought as the word, the symbol, thought which is the response of memory. Now, to see conflict- this historical, sociological process of which we are a part- as a deteriorating factor requires close attention, real intelligence.
Felt the Pretty little Liars Moment😌
Love Kelsey with The Try Guys💕💕
Never really liked Kelsey. I find her abrasive.
I want neds dress tho
So watching this during my time to get ready for school was not the right decision.
up trending
petition for the try guys to go on project runway and have their dresses judged by Tim Gunn
Ya'll remember the dress from the movie DUFF it is very similar to ned's dress..I loved it
Please never bring her back
5:02-5:07 I think we all know what Keith would make                             *Daddy's favourite*
"Thank you for believing in my queerness" C O N S T A N T  mood
Is Ned the new Eugene? Is he the one who’s good at everything
I really don't like the girl that replaced Keith......
Zach was a real one. He took Kelsey's instagram photos for her, and she couldn't even help him get the dress off...😔 lmao
Zach: "kpop stans make this happens pls, DUDES IN DRESS" Me: "KAI!"
but kelsey's dress looks like the start of an actually very cute dress
OK but for real I'd wear Zach's dress if it was a proper sown thing, I liked the design mannn. Tbh I'd wear all of these designs!!! 🥰
id fully wear neds
Moustache Situation: in Germany there actually is a campaign for men to grow a moustache in November to bring awareness to mens Healthcare checkups. Its called MOVEMBER 😁
You guys are back! :) Am so happy.
I miss and love Kelsey so much omg buzzfeed days 😭 can we have morr Kelsey?
I'm proud of Ned for being creative and having fun with the challenge. I'm used to him playing it pretty safe.
we need kelsey more
I’m sorry but Ned was the real winner, he did it sooooo well with the dress!!!
Ned's construction is amazing considering he's never made any dresses and in 3 hours?? Zach's "house dress" is called a daster in Indonesian btw hahah  Oh, and I love Kelsey's pink jumpsuit. Looks so cute and comfy~
WHAAAAATTT????? HOW DID NED NOT WIN??!! this is unfair. he had soooo much MORE to his dress. ugh im mad.
Ned, if you’re going to do a corset back, lace it properly 😂 lace it so that you can tie it at the waist, that’s what enables the cinched waist effect
Why are they so mean to Zach always? 🤬
loving khelsy
I LOVE KELSEY, can we pls have her in more videos? she seems like a great person.
Enedy Dark'ned Denedtia Raned Ned
ned has come so far in terms of personal style if you compare him now to his first appearences in buzzfeed vids. the glow up is real.
I mean... What isn't Eugene great at ? This was FANTASTIC 😍. I'd wear that, no questions !
I want to buy eugenes dress. A burgundy slim cut with a cape 😍😍🤩 yes pleasee
I absolutely loovveeee Ned taking this opportunity to really take risks 🔥🔥🔥 Loving this energy 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Yes to Kelsey! She’s hilarious!
i like her better than keith
The fact that ned didn't win is offensive
NED should have won  CREATIVITY!!!!
hAven't watched try guys in a while but this video was in my recommended so,  we here
Eugene should have a brand, I know it'd be 🔥
I'm here just for Eugene
13:13 as a bisexual, i agree. MAKE IT THE NEXT HOT THING
Eugene looks like a fucking hot model rrrroooowww!
I don’t wear dresses but if I did it would be cut upper mid thigh
As a viewer Ned is the winner he really tried with all those combination 😍
This was great! Kelsey was a fab fill in!! Funny and endearing.
Ned’s mustache is peak dad mode.
Don't feel bad, three hours is NOT enough to make a dress!
I love this but it’s so painful to watch 😂
Kelsey needs to be in more videos. I like her suddenly.
I just need one more subscriber please help
Wait, Try Guys + Kelsey + Laurdiy? 😍😍😍
Kelsey!! No meth!
Zach we will make guys in dresses happening and its already happening
This looks awesome
Can we have Kelsey in more videos? She's really funny, I like her lol
The way that Eugene wore and displayed the dress he made makes him look like an aunt who is mysterious but classy AF and weird, and only comes back to visit once a year during christmas to give all her nieces and nephews expensive gifts, and have a ridiculous load of money to travel all year round 😂
There's nothing Eugene can't do
idc what anyone says, Ned won.
13:15 FYI a few of the Kpop boybands have tried to make that happen with short shorts. They have failed every time, why dont you become one yourself
Kelsey does a great Keith! It's good to see her. I wonder how she's going with her neuralgia.
I've been saying it for years: We need dresses for dudes to be a normal thing please!
My queen Avril at 2:25 😍😍😍
Love that Kel is still justas a wild card bless her. She’s THAT bitch
I'd legit remake Kelsey's dress. It's soooo pretty
Finally something not political! Love this kind of content from the Try Guys!
Kelseys a mood 🤣🤣🤣
Kelsey always was a perfect fit with the Try Guys.
Kelsey's evil laugh when she said: "Just like your career as a Fashionista" sends me 💀💀💀💀💀
Can I buy dress made? Please I need to have that in my wardrobe!!
Congrats on 6th on trending!
WE NEED MORE KELSEY
Eugene: I dedicate this dress to my Mom  Them: Aw, how sweet ( ◜‿◝ )♡  Eugene: Ew, no
keith: dissapears eugene: you know what...  mommy’s favourite.
Eugene: I didn't meant to be sweet
me.....?     not need to wear bra......?     hmm not gonna happen
Eugene is such a Slytherin, Love it ✨✨✨✨✨
I came here to say 'NED WAS ROBBED!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
Ned u my day! Soooo creative!! After a shitty exam I needed this. 😭❤️
Not gonna lie they should release a clothing line which are based on their creations like if they released a better recreation of Kelsey's dress then I would probably buy it.
WTF Eugene? How can you just do all these things. I'm dead
Someone put them on project runway!!!
THIS SHOULD BE A WHOLE ASS SERIES OMG
I'm sorry I don't really like kelsie. She is a little annoying :(
The capabilities of the cape... that was such a missed joke
I was so suprised by ned, WOW
That Instagram really did turn out well, good job, Zach
For a quick second when Eugene said Mari I thought he was referring to Mari Takahashi
Watching Kelsey try hard to try and be funny made me cringe and click away at 11:07 in. And I watched almost every other video FULL on this channel. Be aware editors.
I like Zachs dress better than Neds
Oh my... You guys look gorgeous 💙💙💙
Them yelling 69 while ned does math took me out
Guys, can we do more of your driving comparisons, learning about Roman wrestling, learning dance, doing something INTERESTING? I’m losing faith on you guys. It’s getting SUPER boring!!! I’m TRYING!!! The content is declining though.
I need to have one of those not joking 😃
every dress was good....for me ned is the winner....the extra effort he always puts is impressive
Best: Eugene 2nd: Ned 3rd: „Keith“ / „Kelsey“ 4th: Zack
Ned has become such a skinny legend right?
Love eugine drass♥️
They should do this again but the designers make well constructed versions
when is the next episode of Rank king
where did neds pleats in his dress go?
Eugene so sexy
use this as a ned deserved to win button
I loved Eugene's dress but I think Ned should have won. Zach's Mimi looks like the what my granny wears haha
I've seen it mentioned a lot in the comments but 1 more time can't hurt: Ned should have won. More work, fabric, finishing and thought went into his dress. There's boning, handmade graffiti pattern,  eyelets, pins and trims, layers and if you look at his vision at the start his dress came out exactly the way he intended. Eugene is gorgeous and he usually is the deserved winner but I feel like he didn't put in nearly as much work or creativity as he normally does with these challenges.
here is the thing. ned deserved better. i think even ned was a little disappointed when he didn't got the top place. Eugene's look was good but he had so many construction issues on the back while ned had done all the sewing. soory ned, you are my number 1. i love your confidence.
Loved it surprised they did it in 3hr I made my first dress and it took me 3 weeks and I had my design professor help they are absolutely amazing 👍👍👍👍
how come no one’s mentioning how pretty kelsey’s dress looks?
28:00 that’s what she said... sorry.
Ned should've won!!
Zach in that dress looks like typical eastern europe grandma.
I am so proud of you Ned, I hope he will try things out of his comfort zone more because he totally SLAYED this episode!
come onnn ned SLAYED it
Can any one keep a straight face when ned and zach walked in
Eugene is one step closer to Drag Race lol jk but could you imagine Cheyenne Pepper on RPDR
Omg Stop trying to make fetch happen. It’s not gonna happen !
house of the rising sun
Actually!! Kpop boys wear dresses and heels for comedy a lot  But recently there's been a skirt/half-dress trend going around on mainstream stages. For reference Google ATEEZ Hongjoong skirt, TXT Soobin skirt. Other senior idols have worn skirts/dresses as well for formal shoots, and they look absolutely STUNNING. Eg ACE, BTS J-Hope, Jimin, Suga, NUEST Ren,and one of the most iconic idols of all time, GDragon.
I feel bad for Ned 🥺
I'm happy for Eugene but I was rooting for Ned
what "without instructions" can zach win definitely?
Who's mumu? Lol
Omg eugene 🤩
Would totally wear Eugene's dress to a wedding. I wouldn't look as good as him but that dresses a mood
The try guys Ft. Ned's bulge
I really want to see Zack win...
Ned wins for me with the confidence
Ned seemed chill in this vid its nice to see him being a bit more human and a bit less 10/10 intense screaming. Ned should have won !!! he hammered eyelettes he mixed fabrics and texturesm  he printed his own fabric !!! fashion police have spoken. ( Eugene's is always good he has to be held to a higher standard  )
But I want Ned's dress...
No matter what judges say, Ned won for me.
Kelsey with 40in hips because...hips made for babies to pass through. Ned with 40in hips because...junk in the trunk.
everytime that the camera focuses on Ned, i can't stop looking at his moustache 😂😂😂
Ok listen 😂😂 you REALLY need to wear underwear under a dress. If u EVER wear underwear, thats when u wear it
The mean girls reference at 3:01
They shld just name the series eugene wins evrything 🤣
Awww. ned!!! He improved a lot! Like he actually made a really good one this time.
Eugene, I have that pic n my bathroom over my vanity 4 my makeup cause I LOVE fashion!! (The woman w the flare dress w white gloves) She's my favorite pic on the wall...I want it enlarged!🥰🥰🥰😘😘
Kelsey roasting Keith's sore loser act is everything lmao I have nothing against him most of the time but every time he freaks out in videos it makes me so unbelievably uncomfortable
Who is Kelsey and why's she replacing Keith??
neds dress was my hot topic middle school dream im obsessed
why did i think they were filming in chloe ting’s studio-
i mean, ofc eugene's fashion sense is fire but NED I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!
How does Ned always end up in his underwear 😂
I need a friend like Zach who tells me how to pose 😂❤
17:43 Armys y’all know.
Can we please have more Kelsey?????❤️
Not gonna lie but id rather them just leave it as the 3 of them instead of bringing in these random people haha
Ned deserved the win on this one NGL
I hope Ned wore his dress home just to show off his work to Ariel
Honestly, eugene winning is just karma. He was a young non-hetero asian boy in texas you guys.
NED WAS ROBBED. I REPEAT — NED WAS ROBBED.
Ned DEFINITELY has a waaay better ass than Kelsey!!! Plump vs Pancake wide but flat ass
you guys should have kelsey more in your videos!!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NED DESERVED ITTT
I want Eugene to start a non-binary clothing line. 😊💕
My fashion design major ass was cringing when ned wrapped the paper over himself 😅
Ned was robbed
The try hards
Eugene's creativity is so out there. Even without formal training, he's at par.
Zach dudes in dresses is a thing, they are 🖤✨fem boys✨🖤
Make cosplays without instructions please😘😘😘
This is the best episode of Next in Fashion! :D
The video is great.....anyway... Eugene’s Avatar cosplay was the best thing ever....!!!! Eugene s Azula and zuko........🥵🥵🥵
it's weird... now that Ned's mustache is gone (currently,) seeing him with it in this video again made me kinda miss it!
zach always makes comfortable unique look  i need zach to win
To the person that’s reading this:   You’re a very beautiful and adorable human! Stay healthy during this uncertain time ☔️  Our dream is to hit 1k, We’ve been struggling to get there 💛
Eugene's Texas came out on "This is the first time I've seen this"
Who thinks Eugene should make a clothing line?
Kelsey made a blue squares dress 😂 Keith would be proud
WE NEED A "Try guys wear dresses for a week" OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO GOOD IN THOSE DRESSES
I just love Kelsey😂
Last Try Guys sewing video inspired me to try sewing myself! I managed to successfully make a pleated skirt
I'mma give it to Ned. He deserves it.
I dont get why Eugene won ned did so much more i love em all but that was not so cool....
13:07 who's gonna tell him we already did?
OK what! 24:36 😲 When he came out in heals. Wow. Also. Damn he looked good!!!
Eugene's Drag Race here we GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Eugene's cuffed jeans 😍.
Wanted to see Kelsey in Eugene’s dress!
Eugene's inner american model shows up hard.. dang 😎
I super loved the movement in kelseys dress and also the front of it. But the back... Not a huge fan.
Honestly I'm so proud of Ned's creativity and effort into that dress, he looked so confident and amazing!
Eugene for dragrace
the rubric should be Creativity, Uniqueness, Nerve, Talent and is it a dress XD
Eugene 'a sexy version of my mum'  Dislikes saying that.  Says it again. 😂
Everyone: did great with their dresses and slaying it fabulously.     Eugene: *he’s in his natural habitat,of course he’s gonna swoop in like a bird of prey and look fierce af*
IM SO EXCITED FOR THE PLUSHIES NEXT TIME AHH
Kelsey's attitude and her not helping Zach? That's literally all of us in fashion school.
What if the try guys made shoes without instructions?
Zac and Kelsey's little photography break was a mood
I loved seeing how confident Ned looked while wearing his creation. He looked so comfortable and happy 💜
Zach is on a roll!
ned was ROBBED
Damn, Eugene is hot and sexy in everything. Zac, sweetheart, next time lay the fabric out on the floor, and it will be easier to deal with. Ned, what happened to the pleats? I couldn't spot 'em. Kelsey, I want that dress, plus-size please. With seams, too.
if zach wins...  _don't worry about it_
Ned please shave
I really want to make a dress now.
this is for zach, KAI from EXO wore a dress for his photoshoot with esquire lol
yay kelsey
Eugene prepping for RuPaul’s Drag Race using making this video as an excuse to practice sewing
He really said "Boning is soo hard" 28:00
kpop stans let's get it !! guys in dresses, YES.
i need approximately all the kelsey from here on out.
KELSEY  yeah that’s the comment  she’s so fucking amazing i just can’t....... kelsey is life
For me Ned won this
Zach looks like a grandmother🤣🤣🤣
100% agree with kelsey on the sundress take.
kelsey looks so different now, must be plastic surgery? her nose looks TINY - Shes gorgeous though!
love kelsey XDDD
I fucking love Kelsey in your videos hahaha.
is zac not a where of goth men's skirts, someone introduce him to goth wear
NED WON THIS ONE !!!  NOBODY CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE!!
Neds mustache has to go, omg its the 50's porn stripe
wow i didn't expect to be rooting for ned. great job, everyone.
zach: we need more dudes in dresses  my entire tiktok fyp being femboys in maid outfits: 👁👄👁
Ned deserved to win tho
Kelsey's dress looks like the tablecloth on your grandma's kitchen table. Eugene's has that "club singer who's reluctantly dating a mobster" vibe, Ned's literally looks like something Avril Lavigne wore and Zach looks like a grandma.
I want to see Maggie in Eugene's dress.
NED GOT ROBBED
Zach looks like a Jamaican grandma in an old folks home
Ok so Ned had to get his calculator out to work out 4 x 12, but in the video where he got drunk he managed to work out full bodmas equations in his head??? He’s weird lol
Eugene's look is very Grace Jones.
Ohh.. wow... Eugene won again..? Honestly I'm tired of the same person winning "without instructions".
collab with macarah tewers 🙏🙏🙏
Ned was robbed !!! Although Eugene was beautiful in that eggplant 🍆 dress. Ned killed the design and I believe put the most work into it.
If you like this comment you will have the best day ever
yes, i loved eugene's look soo much, but Ned was ROBBED  he literally put so so much time, creativity, and effort in!
I don't know bout you guys but Kelsey was a great Keith
I love Eugene but Ned got robbed!! His has boning!
Need should have won!
I love Eugene's solely because somehow  it remind me of Jem from shadowhunter.  Kelsey's dress is the one that I probably wear for picnic.
Y’all ever just be SO tired of Eugene winning just because. That garment? Flat. Shapeless. Ned put so much work Into his. Stop letting bias people be the judges omgggggg
Zach looks like a retired Florida judge
I want to buy Eugene's dress.  Someone please make it a reality
Zack's dress is my favorite
Eugene should’ve named his “Mommy’s Favorite”
Eugene just made a dress for his DnD character
I am Kelsey and Zach taking some pictures while I am in the middle doing something (specifically, my modules in my online classes)....
Yo Kelsey’s dress is actually very pretty to look at!! It’s just the fake pockets kind of offended me 😂😂
I really loved  Ned's dress especially  that corset part.
Zachy, baby i already have tons of videos of men in dresses saved in my camera roll
Just so I can laugh my ass off, please do tacking up a horse and riding it will no instructions
I love these sewing videos!!!
after fixing sewing machines all day, I now realize why my job got so busy.
Kelsey and Zack are good energy
naww poor ned, he really tried really darn hard.he deserved that win for creativity seriously
Okay can someone PLEASE TELL ME where does her sweater jumpsuit come from and where the heck can I buy one
NED SHOULD HAVE WON DID YOU SEE HOW MUCH HE DID AND HOW WELL HE DID ALL OF IT THIS IS A MISTAKE
I wanna wear all those dresses, wtf.
Keith: today I’m gonna make a raisin dress
I gonna call it and say that they are gonna start getting people to carry on the try guy as it grows and they want to take new projects on! I'm very curios if they do how it'll happen
I really thought Ned should’ve taken the win on this one
Oh come on Ned had so many textures and more of a design 😄 Eugene's was beautiful but it was also basic
I wonder how they will do if they try to make cream puffs  Trust me it hard as Shit I failed 7 times and succeed 1 out if 9 times
Ned I'm gonna need to have you send me that dress it's amazing
you guys should do try guys try to ice/figure skate that would be so funny!!
Why didn't they just get shane..  he's the perfect replacement for keith!!! 😩
Zachs was literally the best for a NIGHTTIME dress  it was exactly THAT ! He won dont @ me
please please please do ‘try guys try to do nail art’ judged by simplynailogical
Ned really embodied that designer look
eugene: it's in honour of my mom <3 'that's sweet' eugene: *angry panic*
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ:*
Ohhh noooo ned .......😞😞
HUGE Eugene fan, and hot damn, he rocked it here, and those heels!!! I loved that it was in one solid color, and that cape/hood 💜 Ned did really good too :)
NED SHOULDVE WON💕
Honestly, I'd wear every dress except for Zach's. I say that, because I also have a booty I got to show. XD
Kelsey gives me major gone girl vibes
NO MASK! !!!!
🥰🥰💗💗💖💖
😂why zach dress look like a granny
ok i love Eugene but Ned should have won that! I'm sorry but he should have won
Hah Ned's t-shirt tells me they were planning on putting the video up before the election 😂😂
Zach I don't think you've seen the men in maid dresses trend 👀 I think you can pull it off
Eugene's was nice but Ned's was so good!
What would ned do           DADDYS FAVORITE
neds dress looks like it came out straight out of the sims 2. but in a good way
But why is no one talking about Eugene’s heels WOW 🤩
I straight up want Eugene to make me that dress!
Nirvana was grunge not punk rock but I get what Ned meant by rebellious ;) I do love punk rock and Ned's dress tho. Def my fave. :) EDIT: OK COME ON.. NED SHOULD OF WON. I love Eugene, and usually agree with him winning. He is amazing at EVERYTHING. BUT just because he can be a fierce model in the dress shouldn't matter. Ned really went all out, and had so many details he made, and did a damn good job at it. He came out so confident and put his all into it. I truly think his was the best. You rocked it Ned! Eugene attached a shawl because of a comment Kelsea made. The shaw was cool, I do like it a lot, but man I personally AM GIVING IT TO NED!!! YOU'RE THE WINNER IN MY BOOK!! They should just have Eugene model all the dresses after everyone else wears them to them a fair shot lol. I guarantee if Eugene made the dress that Ned made, he would have won with it.
lmao "dudes in dresses, make it happen" it already has. dudes in skirts, dudes in maid outfits, you can find it all on tiktok. you don't even have to look, it finds you.
I absolutely love Lauren's top, does anyone know where it's from?
Ned with just a mustache makes me uncomfortable.
I mean the use of hot glue on kelsey's dress while wearing it?? *Micarah Tewers APPROVED*
Seems like Ned genuinely loves crossdressing. But you know more power to him. If that's his thing.
1:38 omg kelsey is mood HAHHA
Ned: “Why would it be so bad if I won?” So sweet, so innocent.
goth cottage core where ??
Eugene swears he’s not hella gay
To be honest this is the first time i disagree with the result. Ned BRINGS it!! Winner in my eyes, Avril is my childhood.
this is the only time i have ever thought "i believe ned should have won" XD eugene did amazing but it was to solid for me as well as the boning was so impressive but besides all that GG ♥
Eugene's just needs a nice ribbon trim on the hems and a sultry outerwear corset :D
As someone who makes custom clothing for a living, these videos are....so painful.
Ned looks like when Chris Evans had his moustache
noooo keith, i was soooo here for your creation !!! Hope you are okay keith!!!
Not related but wishing another among us game with Eugene please
“Dudes in dresses. Tiktok stans, kpop stans, you have the power to make it happen.”  Bro we’re bringing back boys in maid dresses already, your wish was granted.
I thought Kelseys dress was cute! And I loved Eugene’s idea of a vintage dress and Ned’s dress was just 10/10. Zack tried I’d wear his style of dress just in a different pattern
ned was robbed
I don't even need to see these videos to find out who won 😂 it's obviously going to be Eugene! 😄😄 love❤
K but like Ned should have won
At the end of this without instructions it will be so good if they try to model all of the pieces and put makeup on the model and so on
I'm like not even surprised that Eugene won LMAO.
Why does Eugene always have to wear wigs tho it's not a drag show, and is he Insurecore about his hair or something like come on get over the wigs
I haven't seen Kelsey in a video in a long time, and holy cow I couldn't even tell that that was her.
zach’s dress makes him look like olive oyl from popeye
As a costumer and someone who has been sewing for years this hurts me. But also they are doing somewhat good having no experience.
Eugene’s dress is gorgeous I want to own it 😍
I'm listening to y'all in my ear buds lmao
Ned...hate the mustache.  Love you, but hate the mustache.  Sorry!!!  Shave that lip caterpillar YESTERDAY!!!
Ned was robbed
Laur has Jordan’s on and she doesn’t even play basketball lolllll I guess Jordan’s are a fashion thing tho
Did Kelsey get her lips done? Something about her face looks different and she looks great!
3:46 well that's awkward I have that exact same dress... its true, every bitch loves a sundress
respectfully disagree with the judges decision to crown Eugene. i wish they had judged on the bases of creativity instead of quality. Neds was detailed and themed, while Eugene’s was simpler and bland with a solid colour and a wig.
I want Eugene's dress.
I love seeing Roman and Kelsey pop up in videos! Also I honestly feel like Ned in this dress is his true self if straight guys felt like they could wear whatever they want and I’m here for it
I think Ned's dress should have won
I can’t be the only one thinking Ned’s mustache is super creepy 🤮
“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me” (John 14:6)  -Jesus
Kelsey’s Keith impression is pretty spot on.😂
You guys are so dumb
I mean, Eugine is truly amazing always! So creative.
Kelseys chatioc energy is like wasabi in the  icecream of flavours that is the try guys..... and im here for it 😍
Ned’s was my fave!! And damn his back muscles!!
The Try guys are trending in the Philippines! #6
Damn Ned was ROBBED. His creativity and execution was through the roof!! It looked so incredible, plus those DETAILS man!  The patterns, the corset stuff, the attitude..
this vid is great if u got a thing for backs.. ned is absolutely ripped what and eugene is just. hot in general lets be real. i think if i had to chose a winner i would just have a mental breakdown because I love eugene's and ned's both so damn much
I love kelsey! 🥰
Tired: "That's an offensive stereotype" Wired: "Thank you for believing in my queerness"
So when that judge the very beginning of the video said I'm trying to find something nice to say about it I immediately suspected that he was talking about Zach's just saying
After watching this i can say... NO CAN REPLACE KEITH!!!
Buzzfeed people coming together 😂
Zach HAHAHAH
ned was robbed
More Kelsey  please
Ned was robbed, he should've won!
I love how comfortable Kelsey is with them!!
13:45 Rachel’s laugh HAHAHAHA
Ned's dress looks so good! If i had enough confidence I would so wear it
Ned did so well!
Ned using his phone to figure out 12 x 4 is such a mood
i'm so glad that Ned and Kelsey had the same size butt and could bond over it for a moment
OMG! I actually love Eugene's design - sorry, sewing on the back needs a little fix. But the design was amazing. I'd wear it.
Zach def knows how to take NICE pictures 😂
I want Eugene's dress.
Her dress looked like a pills of towels though.
If Zach wins.... Zach: don’t worry about it   Loved it 😂
NEDS DAD STASH!!!
i wanted to see her in the dressdssses
Awww Ned😘😘😘
legit so happy watching (mostly) str8 cis dudes feeling themselves in these looks like GET IT YES more guys in dresses/skirts thx
Zach's dress gives me strong Joker-in-a-nurse's-dress vibes. Right before he blows up the hospital. That's all!
“dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing” Zach plz have u not seen the maid dress trend
Does anyone know where Kelsey's dress is from?
I would unironically wear Ned's dress.
I love how Kelsey is just vibing at the end. Kelsey is the perfect Keith replacement
1:40 kelsey claiming her dominance through manspreading
Kelsey's Keith Impression was amazing!!!!!!
Okay I kinda was hoping for Ned I was so surprised at how confident he was in constructing his dress and he looked so happy and proud of it 🥺🥺🥺🥺
You know...... my mom has a pouch with the exact pattern as Zach’s dress.
Love Kelsey. Love Ned's dress and his energy and boldness.
29:03 y’all see her legs too right?
Honestly ned should have wonn he put soo much work and efforttt eugenes dress was pretty too but it was just a whole lot of loose fabric hanging around unlike ned who actually sow and stuck and hammered everything into place
You know, Zach kept mentioning Mimi but the only Mimi that I know is Mimiyuuuuhhh😂😂
*Eugene definitely looks like a Handsome Mage  everyone has a crush on.*
Ned made a whole corset with boning and a layered skirt tho??? I'm so proud of him
Ok Bawdy Eugene pulled it out
did they start watching run bts or...
Why not ‚Mommy‘s favorite sundress‘ Kelsey/Keith?!
Kelsey imitating Keith was SO SPOT ON!!  Also, Ned was robbed. I think part of the problem was that we didn't really see Eugene's look without the cowl...it just seemed messy to me underneath. I get that it was a bold look, and he got some great lines, but Ned nailed every part of this comp, hands down.
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT !
Hey guys! Please take a look at my channel! I like to think there's a lot of comedy in there, the self deprecating one lol.
Kelsey brought such a great energy to this video, would be grateful to have her back.
What a confidence ❤️
Aww Kelsey is wearing pink on Wednesday! (well in a video posted on a Wednesday lol)
If you are reading this just know that you are blessed. Amazing and beautiful don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I wish all your dreams would come true just as I want all my youtube dreams to come true thank you
25:40 why does Ned look like he's trying to send us a message
Eugene: *won* Me: *not even a little surprised*
Whoaa congrats on trending guys
Awesome dresses
Making dresses without a Dressipe?
i just want ned to know he had my vote
she has a comment for everything and shes not even a judge.....-_-
Tuned in after watching wayyyy too much news coverage and this is just what I needed. Thanks guys and Kelsey 🙏🏼
I mean this entirely  as a compliment but gosh... Eugene cannot be gayer if he tried. It's so nice to see versatile gay representation that isn't like... stereotypical gays... Does that make sense? I hope I'm making sense. But Eugene's gay is a Brand™.
Eugene's look gave me the mom in kdramas that try to pay girls to stop dating their sons
Me: **Reads title** Also me: *"Oh no..🤦🏻‍♂️"*
EUGENE BEING SUCH A SUPPORTIVE FRIEND IS EVERYTHING
Ned and Eugene were always the only one who puts the most effort and actually "tries". But I think Ned should've won this round especially creativitywise plus he looked so confident during the catwalk. Go Ned!
Before seeing the judging it should be: Ned Eugene tie m, Kelsey, zach
We need more kelsey!!!
I love Eugene's dress
Honestly, I love all you guys, but I felt like Ned should have won. The details in his dress and use of time were impeccable.
their videos are just not fun anymore....  proof: they have had the same number of subs for 5 months
She forgot to say "I am making daddy's favorite"
I LOVE Roman's outfit. I would pay for him to style me if I was rich LOL
And to THINK I was looking forward to seeing a blue pattern squared flannel shirt dress called “Daddy’s Favorite”
That comment from Kelsey about there not being any pockets, so “you still have to stuff things up your p****” was totally out of pocket AND I LIVED FOR IT 😂😂
Personally I think if Ned's dress didn't have such a low waist line I would for sure pick it as a winner but a part of me can't look past the shape of it lol.  Everyone still did so well though! Sewing is incredibly hard and I'm really proud of how well they all did 🥺💕
Eugene serving contemporary Mrs. Robinson 🐍🦊🐯
“I’m tall and I got a big ass mouth so I guess I’m replacing him” HAHAH wtf
Neds fucking character growth... he’s only allowed to have that stash if he wears that outfit
eugenes shirt is insidd out
This is I want Eugene on RuPaul's drag race season 13
...wait pause a moment of silence for Ned’s dress b/c *chef’s kiss* (you got no. 1 in my heart 😌)
Eugene didn't look amused when that guy was saying "I'm trying too find anything good to say" 😍
From someone who just finished her final project in sewing class Aka a dress, I feel this stress, anxiety, and excitement on a spiritual level.
Zachs hair looks good
Neds Freddie mercury vibes are palpable. And Eugene's dress.... gawdamn. Power.
OKAY this episode is like EXTRA good, I love the Try Guys team sooo much 🥺😍
RESPECT THE DONK
As a fashion student I spent the whole video in total panic 😅 Loved the heels though 😍
Eugene and then Ned for me. And Ned if you're trying to be metal, pull the thumb in. You were giving the I Love You sign in sign language.
Where are they shooting tho >,> is this the new office oof
I'm a Eugene fan and ALL for him making this his world, but this time it was Ned. Ned deserved this one.
why is ned dressed like harry styles today
Oh no Ned!! No mustache pls... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Here before 100k likes
Controversial Statement: More Kelsey less Keith 😂😂😂 The ending was hilarious!
NED WAS ROBBED
Eugene... bro! you want the freedom of a dress? We Scots have a wonderful thing called the kilt. They are super comfy, they're short so they are easy to pee in.
Neds dress should've definitely gotten first place It had alot of more effort and creativity in it
Ned should have won
6:00 I thought Eugene is wearing a barong tagalog. Hahahaha
eugenes is always the best
Ned needs his ear pierced
Yes Zach give us nothing😩😩
I started following Kelsey from your videos and I have been loving her journey this past year, she is glowing and seems so happy 🥰
Ned's should of won Dx Eugene's was great but I think his was simple and ideas are accidently kind of dropped in his lap from others comments.
When some of the construction looks better than project runway
EUGENE DID NOT COME TO PLAY!!!
I really thought Ned would win
I FUCKING LOVE KELSEY!!!
I dont measure.. i sew a rectangle i can slip on and pin my bodice and do the skirt (mostly circle cause its easier)  Edit: and add straps...
Ned is my 1st Eugene 2nd. Ned and Eugene I would by those dresses and Kelsey. Sorry zach love you!
The face Eugene makes before he defends Zach’s dress, He lOVES HIM
I LOVED this
NOOOOO OOOOOOO NED SHOULD HAVE WON!!!!
Ned should have won
When Eugene walked out... Wow just wow
Eugene = Queen 👑
I can’t take Ned seriously with this Hitler, pervert, mustache lol I want him to shave so badly lol
I really loved Ned's and Kelsy's dress so much
as a cosplayer and burlesquer...i feel all this pain. i even know better and I have no idea how to make these things! though Ned is going really adventurous with those pleats, and a corset. that is beyond beginner with a pattern, let alone without!
Ned dress was really doing it for me
as soon as I saw Kelsey in the thumb nail I was like YES GIMME THAT SHIT
“My favorite thing about a dress is you don’t have to wear a bra with it” Me with F cup boobs: hahahahaha.... funny
I need Laura’s outfit
WAIT A MINUTE!!!! EUGENE'S WEARING HIS JACKET/FLANNEL INSIDE OUTTTT
Ahhhh I need more Kelsey! She should be in every video, always. Also, hearing her yell and scream as Keith is not triggering like actually listening to Keith is.
wait zach, dudes in dresses is kinda already a thing on tiktok, mostly it’s guys in maid dresses but.. 👀 lmfao
gen z loves men in dresses/skirts y’all are late
Okay I’m only noticing this now but         Why the fuck does Ned put his hands on hips like this
That judge is inspiring me to go get a corset ✨✨
Ned and Eugene killed it
Yo, imma let Kelsey finish, but @micarahtewers shoulda been on this episode
Without a Dresscipe...
I actually missed Keith's energy on this one! But loved having Kelsey on it. Rock on guys!🤩
Some people are a little ahead of you dudes and maid outfits
I wouldn’t be surprised if the hooded dress starts being in fashion after this
Zach: “dudes in dresses. Make it the next hot thing”  Me: immediately thinks of bad bunny
22:51 you're all fucking welcome
“i need you guys on tik tok to make men in dresses a thing” way ahead of you, zach
13:15 as a tiktoker it already is 😎 it used to be boys in skirts now it’s boys in maid outfits
I wanna see the Try Guys make nice suits. That would be great. All we see anymore is them doing women's stuff, but they have lost that shock value, and the novelty has worn off. I think they stopped doing the really cool stuff after the race a couple years ago with the dune buggies, the boats, and the sled dogs. I don't feel like they have anything for me here anymore because they just do the same dull stuff now. The Halloween costumes are funny, but that is about the only thing that has really been different from their new normal. Then they got political, and I felt like they were trying to shove down my throat who to vote for. I don't care if they feel even the slightest bit different about who to vote for than me, but I don't believe that such an influential person(s) should be very out spoken directly to their audience, influencing those less educated into not forming their own opinions. Agree or disagree, the try guys could've pushed everyone to vote without trying to influence one way or the other.
not TikTok teens and Kpop stans being the most powerful people 😭😭
Zach’s hair looks really nice
Omg Kelsey’s in this?!? 😍😍😍
whens the next viiideo???
my personal rankings (Which are obviously the right ones) 1. ned 2. eugene 3. zach 4. kelsey
Kelsey killed this challenge
Can anyone tell me why did they delete the words "feat Kelsey..." in the title
Ned's mustache reminds me of John Watson from Sherlock Holmes 😂  (Sorry ned✌️)
Can we keep Kelsey as the first try girl !
I know it's lame, but I so appreciate the vocab sensor... It truly helps me so much mentally. Thank you for the effort! As for content, so funny and enjoyable! I've been sewing since I was 11 and still do the most idiotic mistakes sometimes, so I understand the frustration of doing something like sewing ones arm holes shut. Keep it up you guys and hang in there! 😉
I'm so excited for the plushies episode! I love sewing but I don't think I could have one looking good without a pattern haha
can she replace keith on a more regular basis?
“i need you guys on tik tok to make men in skirts a thing” way ahead of you, zach
Kelsey!
This is a terrible idea...
Ned ! Ned !! Ned !!!
i need the try guys to queer eye someone
I think Kelsey NAILED the Keith-isms haha. That "Are you kidding me!" At the end, I Felt that! Lol
Notice how they didn’t say anything about 4th place lmaooooo 💀💀💀
eugene is unstoppable, how could he be good at everything !?
I was shocked, I was appalled, I was confused, I was conflicted, I was concerned but I was intrigued
Is it just me or is Eugene giving off major little red riding hood vibes
I mean. Ned was fulllllll robbed.
Where is Kelsey's blush jumpsuit from! I really want thatt D:!
Eugene dress is awesome but I would if it fixed up more.
THE SUSPENSEEEE i cannot. This is like a reality tv show lmao
I fucking love Kelsey idc what anyone says
laura interrupted the actual professional designer midway through a sentence so much it pissed me off
Neds was the best imo
I love a Kelsey appearance!
I missed seeing Kelsey in videos! She is SO FUNNY
Kelsey impersonating Keith at the end hahaha 🤣🤣🤣
Gotta love how when the others are being interviewed about how the sewing is going, you can see Ned at the back in only his top and underwear.
Just love you guys!
IVE DONE THIS BEFORE but I made one without sewing  for Halloween contest x’D it’s still holding up
My Boyz looked Fab! ( Ned still should have won. Eugene was good but the hood was an after thought and we all know it. Love you though Eugene!) 💙🌈
"guys in dresses, make it the next big hot thing"  me: simping for dudes in a maid costume 👀 sure,, yeah,,
Did anyone doubt Eugene was going to make something awesome?  Damn
Everyone in here is talking about the dresses when I wanna talk about Kelsey’s spot on Keith impression lol
Eugene we need to wig shop and learn how to care for it together!!! Why did you not brush it!! I got you boo
Ned and Kelsey: *measure their butts*  Me: *scrambles for a tape measure to compare*
Didnt realize Ned's back was so sexy. His ass has competition.
zack and his ankles
Eugene and Ned FULLY killed it omg
Nah this isn’t gay as shit...
I was so thrown off when I saw Kinetic cosplay on here
"What kind of dress would Keith be making?"  Keith busts in like the Kool-Aid man: *_DADDY'S FAVORITE_*
I want eugene to make a fashion line so bad
When they asked to say something Keith like she really missed a golden opportunity to talk about Keith's chicken sauce
I've been looking into dresses for men for a while now. Specifically, for dresses that maintain a male form. I've also been looking into truly innovative fashion that is attractive and wearable.   So Eugene's dress is super satisfying. I know he's gender fluid, but the lines of the dress would completely work for someone who was 100% male presenting.  The cape provides support for the open back to be cut wide without falling. I want everyone who can sew to copy it and make tutorials.   Ned's dress is cut like a dress for a feminine body and thus it fails to accentuate all the positives of his masculine body.   Zach's dress confirms that granny night gowns look amazing on men and should just be a thing.   Kelsey's sun dress offers some solutions for anyone who has run short on fabric.
Ned you did amazing!!!! I sew, and I still haven’t messed with boning. I loved it!!!
Ned actually looks so natural in this environment while working on his dress especially at 12:02 ?? And I love his little moment with Eugene when the high-fives over his corset back, why is my heart so warmed by this video???
I swear, There is NOTHING Eugene can't do excellent
And why did Zach have to get out of his dress, when Kelsey was in hers? Did I just miss something
During an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Bill Gates said he believed a 'bio-terrorist attack' may be coming and that we need to prepare for 'Pandemic 2.'  He also ominously said, as he was seated alongside his wife during an event hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, that the next virus outbreak 'will get attention.'
Keith Keith Keith 💔💔💔💔💔
NOOOO KEITH IS MY FAVE :’(
13:13 boys in maid and nurses outfits are becoming big
Petition for Kelsey to be a new member of the try guys?
Honestly, I'm like where to I get a pattern for Eugene's dress.
Eugene's dress was Moira Rose meeting a 50's widow.
@kineticcosplay is so sweet irl! And her coplays are amazing :D
Ngl I'm gonna wear all of their dresses. Kelsey's would be worn often.
Where's Keith?
Sheath dress will be easy way to go
how about try guys try to stop talking about politics ?
I want Eugene dress, it's so wonderful
Ned looks like Freddie Mercury in this video.
NEW OFFICE SPACE?! 👀😂
The judges are focusing on Zach's V-neck and ignoring the fact that he did SLEEVES?! I think Ned's is so poorly designed and unflattering.
ned was robbed ngl
neds looking super fit.
Judges: I'm having such a hard time deciding Me: It's Eugene... Judges: I'm just going back and forth Me: You're going to pick Eugene... Judges: it was such a hard decision Me: Let me guess... Eugene? Judges: We can only pick one of you... Me: It's Eugene... Judges: It's Eugene!!!  Me: I'm personally shocked...
Unpopular opinion: Ned deserved first place!!
Ned should’ve won
Did she say meth? Ew
so nobody appreciates Kelsey's impressions on Keith? LOL
Zach said to make TikToks with men in dresses but HAS HE SEEN FEMBOYS????? HAS HE SEEN GUYS IN MAID OR BUNNY OUTFITS???!? LIEK THIS IS ALREADY A THING ZACH.
Ned should've won. Eugenes was so easy to make, cmon ned had BONING N USED A FUVKING HAMMER
Just adding to the comments saying Ned deserved to win! He used ambitious techniques, had the most attention to detail and embellishments, and from what I could tell his construction even looked better than Eugene's. I think the drapey style of Eugene's was a bit more forgiving, but whenever the cape bit was around his shoulders instead of worn as a hood, the whole neckline looked sloppy. Also, I am loving Ned living his best life expressing this side of himself he hasn't had the chance to before!
I love the normalcy of Ned being in his underwear 😂😂
Ned should have won!!!!
AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF EUGENE IS BAD AT *ANYTHING*.
Only the Try Guys could post a 31 minute video and have me still want to watch it
*zach walks out*  me: “that shit looks like a moo moo”  zach: “this look was inspired by a moo moo”  me: “oop”
OK CAN WE TALK ABOUT NED IN @22:44 BC I AM FLOORED
did kelsey just say “that’s what i said the first time i smoked meth!” 😭
I looooooooveeeee Eugene but Ned should have won!
Ned's dress is... Wow
I would honestly buy Eugene s dress
The boy judge was not having Zach I could feel the shade
Probably unconventional opinion, but I totally think Ned won this round. I think Eugenes dress was subpar and kinda messy. I guess as professionals they can tell what is harder to do and all, so I wish they would have explained why specifically Eugene’s dress won.
I love Eugene but Ned should have won!!
isn't it imposible even for a profesional to make a decent dress in only 3hrs...??
Eugene's FIGURE in that dress was so sexy. God, hes so beautiful it's honestly frustrating. Also, can he stop being so talented at everything???
Ned won in my heart. He spoke to my teenage emo self.
Ned looks like a gay French artist dad
Believe it or not I've actually sewn a dress before😂
Ned is the real winner ❤️
Has Kelsey gotten facial surgery for her Trigeminal Neuralgia? She looks different
Have the try guys thought abt doing a zero waste day?! That will be interesting to see how much trash the guys make😀
Ned deserved to win..
OMG, we need more Kelsey kkk
Zach dress for some reason reminds me of Olive from Popeye
The hood on eugene just gave him his aditude and neds whole outfit was his aditude
I feel like ned deserved this one
Petition to keep Kelsey on the try guys  I fucking love her
I kinda of want to see someone make the zack and kalise dress as a finished product.
I love how Kelsey just glued herself into the dress 😂
love kelsey
Kelsey looks fab and I’m living did she get her lips done cause wow I need to get mine done even if she didn’t she’s adorable and I love her
kelsey is so beautiful wow!!!
Dresses are for everyone! 💃💃💃
Can i just say that i looooove Kelsey in this video!!! she was so much fun to watch
Loved all their dresses:))
Ned should have won tbh
That hood was fire 🔥
My only problem with neds dress is that I would have loved to have seen the skirt sit a little higher, I think it'd be much more flattering with a skirt that starts at the mid drift and end at the mid thigh. It would have given the dress a little more shape and elongated the legs.
As a Costuming major in college, these videos stress me OUT
imo ned won I MEAN LOOK AT HIM IN THAT DRESS HE SLAYED IT
ned shined in this episode! i agree that he should have won.
I love Eugene and all, but that wig was HATEFUL
I didnt miss keith at all
Can Kelsey become a regular Try Guy? She was awesome in this.
The loving and mostly supportive selfie break
Bunch of fruitcakes.
The fact that Kelsey took Keith's place & came in 3rd is hilariously fitting
13:12 I feel like zach would be delighted by the boys in skirts and maid outfits trend on tiktok right now
Ned < Ned with mustache
They all look really goos but kelseys is the only one I would actually wear😂
I wish Kelsey would often be a guest in their videos. She's so cool and funny. Love her and the Try Guys! <3
Ik I’m a kpop stan but idk how we would collectively start the trend of men in dresses....
Kelsey looked so beautiful in this video!
I love and respect you Eugene, but Ned was robbed.
I paused the video at the point where Ned said “Are you guys use to it yet?” And the answer is No Ned give me Bearded Daddy Ned any day of the week...
I think for looks it should go: Ned Kelsey Eugene Zach But for construction: Ned Eugene Kelsey Zach
zach and kelsey killed it. They had really great chemistry (not saying other members didn't) and made for more laughs.
OH HELL YEAHH
I wish u guys had cc
Neds was top tier. Avril Lavigne is crying tears of joy.
I would buy Eugene's dress in a second
Eugenes dress looks fucking incredible. It’s kind of insane how good he is at literally everything
I'm sorry but that was the worst Keith impression. 😂
Watching these videos makes me so happy
I’m sorry but I CANT STOP LOOKING AT KELSEY’S DRESS. Her dress looks so cute and something I would pay to wear. Like seriously the patterns compliment each other so well, the design is so flowy (perfect for a hot day) and the slits make it SO FLATTERING. I would legit buy that dress if it was available on the shelves man.
Ned's dress was AMAZING!!! It's exactly what I would have wanted to wear during my Avril phase. And his confidence while wearing it was so cute
This is the first time I’m upset that Eugene won. Yes it was a good dress but I felt Ned totally deserved first. Get them next time Ned!!!!
I want to see Kelsey in Eugene's dress
ned entrance was like a wrestling entrance hahaha so confident so agressive
I expected Eugene to do well but Neeeeed, it’s everything 11 year old me loved
So... can we get these dresses into production please? Like I'd actually buy them!!
kelsey talking about outfits that are easy to pee with is a mood and a must
This would have been even better if Kelsey and Eugene were drinking
I’m gonna say it... Ned’s back at 22:44 is straight up impressive
Kelsey's dress actually looks very cute
Bootleg Rupauls drag race but I’m living for it
Almost cried at how excited and confident Ned was
I feel Kelsey channelled Keith pretty well.. needed more swearing though...
I love the tryguys and they are usually so good about having captions accessible. But this video did not have them available and was hard to follow as a hard of hearing person. I hope the next video has them available!
Im sure it’s been said before but... Eugene on RuPaul’s drag race?
I pay attention, but I'm just too lazy to put it into action  This is me everyday when my homework isn't done 😂😂😂
This is taking my mind off the election🤣
I thought for sure Ned would win...Eugene's was great, but boning and grommets (BY HAND!) are SO hard!
Kelsey should have put oatmeal and raisins in the dress so she could name it "Daddy's favorite"
yo I do love how each of these Looks works with their energies!
Not surprised at Ned's success considering he's done theatre!! One of the best disciplines to learn practical, applicable skills.
I would not have been mad if Ned won this one!
I didn't know they block negative comments No wonder their content is suffering
I never comment ... BUT Ned the stash has got to go
I hate Kelsey.
So this is my first time on this channel and this was fun to watch. Idk if y’all do this. But it’s be cool to see if y’all give those same dresses to pros and see how they finish it to see which had the most potential
Eugene looks like a sexy orchid nun
Okaaay sooo... more Kelsey please and thank u 🥺
Neds was best
I was just learning about sewing and then they posted this. First thing on my list: make a dress :D
Ned's back when he turns is something else, really, for a small moment I almost placed him 1st in my imaginary ranking, but then of course Eugene destroyed whatever notion I thought I had of the competition and I'm extremely proud of him for it :)
FINALLY Eugene is finally measuring something
lol neds was just yes.. yes just yes 3020
Kelsey is a vibe.
don't have to be ethnic to have a nana in a house dress, ffs
okay but neds mustache is iconic
Oh I love Mari's work!! One of my cosplay inspirations!! I got to meet them at a con once and they're super sweet too! 🥰
3:05: Zach stop tryna make bedsheet happen, it's not gonna happen  😂😂😂
24:46 zachs face when he sees Eugene 🤣🤣🤣
I legit want eugenes dress
Okay Ned, you flipping killed it! When you said you were making a corset top dress I laughed thinking there was no way, and yet- you did. Loved the confidence, the Avril vibes, the hand drawn graffiti pattern, and damn your upper back looked hot in this dress. Very impressed at your non-basic bitch design this round!
Zach is the only one who made sleeves.... That aint easy.
When they gonna play snatch game?
I've never been more attracted to ned 😳
really loved this video, but i do think that ned should have won, his construction was the best by far and he had a vision and delivered on it
The try guys try making IKEA furniture without instructions
Vote me fellas🇺🇸
Ok soooo when can we expect to see a try guys themed hooded dress in the try guys store?
I love that Ned has a dark side, his dress was amaze-balls
And you need to get rid of that mustache yeah Ned
Petition for Full Throttle Fulmer to come out more often...bc that dress was pretty amazing
I love how Kelsey saw and took the opportunity to tell Zach to "stop trying to make fetch happen!"
❤️❤️❤️!
i would watch an lgbt coming of age movie like this
ned deserved 1st place this is bs
Oh Eugene, you’re gonna need so much more fabric for a dress to hold that shape and a petti.
are y’all donating the sewing machine because I can’t afford one... 😅
I think ned should've won he seemed like he put way more effort into his
Eugene always steals the show but I would have actually given this one to Ned - as far as I can tell his piece was more complex and well executed, even if I would wear Eugene's before Ned's. Good job!
I love how we've gone from eugene drinking heavily to them smoking weed on camera to now "teehee, meth" is just fine and dandy. come on. that's ridiculous.
I thought Ned's mustache would bother me so so so much more but I'm really not bothered.. should I be concerned 😅
Zach's dress wins by a landslide
I love kelsey omg
All of them: talking about how they want to wear more dresses Me: do it
I need more of KELSEYYYYYY
I love how calm this is I needed it
Omg.. Ned in that mustache makes me think of Napoleon Dynamite
Hey guys look. We need more Kelsey.
Ned is such a dad
Love kelsey's impersonation of keith!!! ahaha
Ned holding up his middle fingers walking away is a VIBE
Me why is Zack using butterfly clips and not pins? Wait did she just brag about doing Meth? Eugene is Winging It? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.
I love Kelsey hahahaha
Kelsey: "As long as Ned doesn't win" Ned: "Why would it be so bad if I won?" 🙁  Awww  I don't know why, but I thought that was so sweet!!
ned looks weird for me
HOW REFRESHING it is to see women with body hair on camera <3
Zach's dress just screams the Golden girls to me
This is SO cool where they each went with the shapes and execution, I'm so here for it !!
wow this sure is a lot of people who are guests who aren't social distancing, wearing masks, or being safe at all. assuming keith got it and that's why he's not there.
why there osnt any english sub :(
Okay but like... kinda think Ned won this one 🤷🏻‍♀️
12:58 It’s hard to find non-binary clothing because there is no such thing. he must be thinking of gender neutral clothing bc that makes no fucking sense lmao
Zach: Is actually great instagram pose director   Kelsey: Your hand looks creepy
I love how Ned is just in his underwear 😂
I just want to see Kelsey in Eugenes dress so bad
Thank you for giving me something else to pay attention to besides, well ya know, everything else.
WE HAVE THE SAME BOOTY😂😂
Well kpop Stans you heard him MEN IN DRESSES
Zach: dudes in dresses, make it the next big thing Me: IS ZACH GINNA BE A FEMME BOY?! Heck yeah! :D
my mom is making my prom dress, she is using a pattern though lol
Zach asking tiktok teens and kpop fans to make dudes in dresses the next hot thing. Zach, may I introduce you to.... Mr. Harry Styles?
Why is Eugene always so good at these? He'd be completely dominating if he didn't always get so experimental with the food-based ones.
I want Ned’s dress. Like . It is awesome.
Why does Ned look like Freddy Mercury from Queen with that mustache??
This is my first long term encounter with Kelsey. I love her! She has such great energy & wit.
Eugene’s description of Zach’s dress was on point
i love kelsey sm
WHATTTTT ned totally deserved to winn
You need to make a hat video!!!!!
I’m a simple woman. I see Kelsey, I click.
I need more Kelsey in my life.
Eugenes dress gives me bougie funeral vibes😂
Ned was robbed
So proud of Ned with this one! Would love to see him step out of his comfort zone more. Loved the confidence!!
yea but where's keith
edits out when they say f*ck but shows the full word on the screen?????????
Amazing performances from everyone,  obvious bonus points of Kelsey's spot on Keith impressions!
China Joe.  China Joe Biden .ccp  Biden !Chine need Biden!  Biden cheated! Cheat Biden!
I really love this series 💞💖😍😍😍😍😂💕💕💕
I’m sorry but mustache Ned is DOING something for me 🥵😂
Anyone else here to avoid the polling news? 😅
Zach: I don't make anything with my hands. Oh... that's... sad... lol
Honestly, would it be okay to make a dress inspired by eugenes and give him credit? Like I really wanna work on a dress with a similar shoulder and hood design! But I dont wanna step on toes and steal the idea. Im just so inspired this gives me so many ideas!
Eugene's dress gives me Mother Gothel vibes
Laur repeatedly saying "She was a sk8rboi!" Is making me nuts. HE was a skater boy. SHE was a girl. & He wasn't good enough for her.  Sure gender is a construct but the lyrics are the lyrics & words matter.
Zach... men are already in dresses on tiktok. You just have to look up maid dress :).
22:45 holy shit Ned got ripped for real.
Eugene legit if you mass produced that dress I would buy it. I'd totally buy a fixed up version of Kelsey's dress too, it's cute as hell
my personal rank:  4: ned 3: kelsey 2: zac 1:eugene
Testament to my love of the Try Guys: I had a feeling from the get go that Eugene would go for the Dior New Look silhouette (which i looove too!!) 💕💕  Also get you a friend like Zac who'll take instagrams of you whenever omg
"As a goth..." loardy
girl was terrible zach was worse... find a new try guy and bring back Keith
bruh don’t bring that girl back
I freaking love Ned’s dress.  I would totally buy it and then never have the actual confidence to wear it.
love how zach suddenly became a latina abuelita
Of course Zack chose the arguably least dress dress
1 eugiene 2 kelsey 3 zac 4 ned
Eugene's dress made me think of Anjelica Huston in The Witches 💜
I think Ned should have won this one, and here’s why:   Even though I LOVED Eugene’s, I think that as far as construction and creativity, Ned’s was far more impressive.  He had a theme, multiple embellishments, a corset with freaking boning AND eyelets, and hand drawn patterns.  Eugene’s was elegant, but all cut from the same fabric and one color.  The hood was creative, but not nearly as creative as the many different facets of Ned’s dress.   P.S. I adore them both and love what they made, I just slightly disagree with the judging, and do still understand why it was super close.
man I love Kelsey! I still go back to the “Eugene Drinks Every State's Most Iconic Alcohol“ video, they’re too funny together
Every time Ned goes outside his fashion comfort zone, he ends up STUNNING 🤩
I fucking love Kelsey please have her around more often!!
Zach: make boys in dresses a thing TikTok: cat boys in maid outfits
Guys in dresses are already the top thing (well it's a close second to the us election)
Oh I wonder whose gunna win this one
Zach is going to make the best Instagram husband 😂
Ned was the audience's winner ❤
Am I the only that notices that Ned doesn’t like kels?
Oh YES I BEEN WAITIN FO THIS ONE
Ned with a mustache makes my bussy quiver...
Is it just me... or have been asking them to constantly try super feminine things.
Does anyone remember Kelsy from when she drank 50 drinks with Eugene. When Eugene worked at buzzfeed.
Proud of how Ned branched out compared to his usual approach of "tried and true". He had a lot of impressive elements in his construction!
we haven`t seen kelsey in a long ass while... probably since the buzzfeed days missed her a lot, but i`m not gonna lie..... not as much funny banter as i think there should be, i don`t know if its because of the insane schedule or maybe they had to concentrate on the dresses more, but its not my favorite.
we have so many baking competition shows............let’s do a sewing show OMG
I hate to say this but Ned was robbed
I seriously need Neds dress lol It was cute af
Hot take: Ned was robbed
22:44 THE POWER THIS SHOT HAS
Can we get someone to actually make that dress for his mom (or he can) and give it to her and she tries it on? Can that be a video?
My first big sewing project was a dress pattern that I bought based on the look of the dress rather than the difficulty level. I thankfully had my mom help me interpret the pattern but it was still a doozy. Interfacing, darts, ruffles, pleats, ruching, a zipper and a cross body bodice plus the sizing being off on the pattern so I had to sew the seams at an extremely tiny margin in order for it to fit my chest and shoulders. Woof, it was rough y’all but it ended up looking awesome and super flattering.
They need to sit down and tell Kelsey to dial it back about 25%. She brought a lot of nasty, unfriendly energy to the video, and maybe it was just the edit but she was really overbearing and dominated a lot of the video. I think she's not bad overall, but she needs to figure out how to mesh with the cast better.
Ned nailed this.
i wonder why they don’t wear masks?
13:07 shall I get introduce you to ✨femboys✨
Ned looks like the extremist fashion designer in every movie that cannot be impressed lol. Love the stache and scarf look, issa mood
Eugene’s dress is giving me Carol vibes from the D&D episode. Love it.
Ned where do you get your pants!!! I love the pop of color your pants give. It's not like the normal blue.
This is the most ‘people from LA when there’s a camera around’ video I have seen on this channel.
Kelsey is easily the worst guest they have......stahhhhp putting her on here!
Okay but need to see the purple dress on Kelsey👏👏👏👏
I lovee Kelsey!!
Why don't you guys have. Captions on your videos?
YESSSSSSSSS
If Keith was her his dress would be   DADDY'S FAVORITE  lmaoo
If Ned ever shaves that Stache I will Riot.
Judges: Winner Eugene!!!  Me: Not Surprise 🙂👌 Eugene is so talented and idolized him 😍😍❤
Did Kelsey show up drunk?
I need to say it...... NED WAS ROBBED
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
Yes!!! I want to see more men in dresses!! 😍😍😍
"if zach wins then the patriarchy wins" IM DEAD
love eugene but ned should've won this!!!
Love Chelsea! I think the next without instructions should also include alcohol. 🤣
Kelsey is giving me *big* Alexis Rose energy
I feel like Ned had a bunch of personalities this video
I have learned from copious Project Runway seasons that you can make a quick drapey dress look good, and Eugene did, but Ned's took skill with the specific pieces he used. While they both looked amazing, I'd give it to Ned.  But all 4 have great aspects to them. Kelsey's was cute and Zack's looked the most comfy and I'd totally rock the miimii.
ned was ROBBED. his was so much more technically impressive.... so sad :'(
I loved Kelsey in this video!! great guest
I thought kelsey quit drinking for the whole mental health thing?? Awwh 😕
No offense but I'm bummed ned didn't win??? Like fuck man, he did boning, he made a corset, yeah he used tape but I've sewn many things and I would NEVER attempt a corset, especially without a pattern. And like, I used to work at a craft store
Does anyone realize that eud\gene's shirt is inside out or his flannel
can you try making pottery without instructions
Ned was robbed!!! eugene’s dress was not that impressive but he makes everything look good so that helped lol he could’ve worn zach’s dress and made it look 10x better 😂
More Darragh plz
I vote for Neds dress hahaha
Let’s talk about Eugenes silk button up 🥺😍 Exquisite... chefs kiss.. *ques French cooking music*
Zach looks like Olive Oyl on vacation in Hawaii
i like the feminine touch of A female that references female movie roles!
I agree i really do love a sundress
Great Keith impression
Of course Eugene won, his dress looks fancy af.
Honestly Ned was robbed this episode!
“Do something different with your hand, it looks creepy.” *struggles to look normal*
Me: he’s gonna sew the sleeves shut Zach: sewing Me: he’s gonna sew the sleeves shut Zach: turns the dress the right side out Me: he sewed them shut Zach: I sewed the arms shut! Me: oh fuCK HE SEWED THE ARMS SHUT-
Lmao Zack, guys in dresses are ALREADY A THING lmao I love it, I wanna femboy boyfriend omg😭😭
Yawn... Eugene wins again 🙄
Honestly Ned rocks the moustache.
Kelsey's keith is perfect!
I'm so shocked that I haven't seen a comment about the "thats what I said the first time I smoked meth" line 😳
Ned was robbed.
Sorry Zack we are stuck in maid outfits rn
Do I like Ned's dress? No. Do I still think he should have won based on technical details and creativity? Absolutely.
i hope the try guys make without recipe series again :(( i really like 'em i watched it multiple times
Can we get an appeal... Ned definitely should have won lol
i love how zach stopped caring about the competition when kelsey asked him to take pics of her, thats a real friend
Hey Eugene! Not trying to be rude; I love the Try Guys! But calling certain clothes "non-binary" isnt the best option, because non-binary people wear all sorts of clothes and present in different ways :). I think the word you were looking for was "androgynous" or "unisex" clothes. My partner and I are both non-binary, but I actually present in a very feminine way. Just wanted to throw that out there!
i think ned should have won tbh
I love everyone dresses wow
Y'all remember Eugene's dress because there are going to a lot of copy cats.
I haven't even finished watching the video & I already feel like Eugene won🤣🤣🤣
I need to know where Kelsey’s pink jumpsuit is from.
I'm living for Eugene sitting up and clapping for Ned after he catwalked out of there. <3
I’m loving Kelsey as the guest
When Kelsey said... "what if zack wins" and Zack replied  "Don't worry about it" with the most happy yet defeated face ever I damn near died laughing 😭
“i pay attention! but i’m too lazy to put it into action.” -kelsey
Kelsey's impression is Keith honestly wasn't that far off from the truth.
Zach made an Animal Crossing dress
Please make wigs in one episode!!!
I felt sorry for zach, I feel like everyone is bullying him ..call me sensitive OK  😁
Ned was ROBBED
There’s an old lady reading a newspaper in Lilo and Stitch, and she’s wearing Zach’s exact dress!
22:43 NED!!????!!! 🙀
is eugene nonbinary?
No captions available?  Lame.
Let this message to be spiritually received...  share to let others know...  To believers and non believers, "THE FINAL JUDGEMENT," is at hand, know that what you choose and accept for your spirit (including your actions in the carnal), will be your eternal fate... You must be very cautious how you choose to live from here on out! Please there are no lukewarm heavenly bodies in Heaven!!! Choose now, in your heart and spirit, righteousness or evil?!!  Please everyone,  if this message is spiritually received...  share to let others know...
"Dudes in dresses make it hot" Me: "But anime boys in dresses"            ...😃
Ned with the mustache and dress and muscles is giving me hella Julien Solomita vibes🤘🏻
Did anyone else notice all of a sudden bed just wasn’t wearing pants for a sec???
I wish more men did this. I loved everyone's dress
Need that Eugene dress
So is this Without a Recipe with fashion? Cool
I am *So* mad Ned didn't win. Eugene's was great, but half of that was him just being a great model. Besides that, it was really just Eugene being Eugene. It wasn't surprising or exciting.. Ned's design was awesome, and he really went out of his comfort zone and explored. He made a corset with boning FFS!  Ned was robbed.
Ned was giving me madddd julien solomita vibes
I'm living for Kelsey in this
are you kidding me? ned is the real winner here, that dress what SO FREAKING creative.
Ned definitely won this challenge
I'm so obsessed with Ned's Mustache 😍
I know Kelseys sober but she still gives off drunk girl energy the second half of this video and that’s why I love her
No hate for her but I didn't like Kelsey being here, Idk it felt uncomfortable to watch (for me, it's okay if you liked her)
If someone could make Eugene’s dress in my size I’d actually kill to have that. Can we please somehow find a way to get that to fans???
Im sorry but this was such bs, I absolutely love Eugene but Ned should’ve won hands down 🤷‍♀️
I know everyone's saying Zach looks like their ethnic grandmother (which he does), but he also looks like he's sewn himself a toilet door sign
Ned Wins ❤🖤🤘
Ned I hate your mustache. You went from a 7 to a 4, and from the 3rd best looking Try Guy to least best (obv not factoring in Miles)
Ned should have won
Ned should have won. Eugene's dress is dramatic I must say but with Ned's dress, it has techniques and character. It is just my opinion. Please don't bash me. 😍
Ned was robbed
Upset that they trashed Zach like that. Honestly I would wear that every day, looks comfortable af. Not the best but shit I could still come up with some nice things to say about it
Ned was fucking robbed
Ned should have won. His was by far way better, his construction was great as hell for a newbie, whereas Eugene didn't attempt anything too out there. The patterns, the design choices, everything, Ned did better. I do feel like there may have been some favoritism because Eugene looks good in everything and so that's why they gave him the win. I like all the Try Guys equally, but Ned deserved to win.
They all killed it
Loved kelsey
as a non fashion student, ned was not robbed
They all killed it!
I honestly want a dress like Eugene’s lol. They should sell them in try guy colors!
As someone who spent.... SO MANY HOURS crying over a brother sewing machine older than me in the basement of the theater department saying "I hate sewing, I hate sewing, I HATE SEWING" over and over and over again... this was too real. (^o^)
Eugene is queen in this. That dress was gorgeous on him
i love the sims 4 music
Someone NEEDS to tell Zack that a moo moo is a nickname for fans of the kpop group mamamoo
Men should wear dresses. Normalize all of this
uh oh. 666k views.
Please subtitle your videos :)
Sooo many commercials.
Kelsey reminds me of Katherine Ryan~ in a good way
Kelsey should always be a contestant lol but with Keith too, it can be like all five of them!
Kelsey as Keith is a real mood
Knew it.
If Zach wanted to show of his ankles why he wearing high top shoes? just saying. defeats the point of the showing off of the ankle
For me it was 1. Kelsey 2. Zach 3. Eugene 4. Ned I really appericate the work Ned put in but for me it was just really messy not punk
Ned's dress totally looks like a goth Scotsman. The skirt looks more like a kilt, kinda. If Ned's was an actual dress, I would totally buy it, it's cool, it's just not well executed. Eugene's, if done a little better, would be awesome. Ita cool. My order would be, Eugene, Ned, Kelsey, then Zac, or Kelsey, Ned, Eugene, Zac. Sorry Zac. Their all cool, but If everything was professionally done, they would be cool.
For what it’s worth, I can’t stand Kelsey. Her not helping Zack. It just bothers me.
I'm dissapointed there's not more comments about Ned's pornstache.
As an actual dressmaker, this is terribly painful to watch. I just really want to help them.
Love all the try guy but i think is soooooooooo unfair Ned didn´t win He made soooooo much work. Eugene´s dress was super pritty and elegant but Ned´s......no words, all the sewin the corset the skirt part the belt the stamp i mean.....when judges said their choise will sorprise some people i thouth NED´S DRESS WON, THEY RECOGNICED HIS WORK....but no, they lied about judging on CREATIVITY CONSTUCTION AND IS IT A DRESSS SO MAD MAD
Kelsey channeling Keith is completely accurate.
Y’all had the opportunity to call this “Without a Dresscipe” (dress recipe) and you didn’t. This hurts.
Ned was awesome <3
Eugene, yes!! I ADORE New Look!!!
Ok this chic thinks shes got a butt or donk lmao but legit when she turned around it looked like flat ass to me lmao shes just got hips and curves but her ass is small af lmao honey ned has a bigger better butt than u he just doesnt have as wide hips lmaooo
Kelsey should join the Try Guys
Kelsey is so funny, I love her! she brings a different energy to the group that is so complementary! Hope she can be in many more videos like this  Also her Keith impression was spot on 😂
Kelseys being Keith was everything when she got 3rd place and did her Keith freak out🤣🤣
I have the exact same qualifications as Lauradiy. 😊😂
My choices for 1 - 4 were the same as the judges. Note to Eugene, finish off those seams. add an enameled Tri Guys logo pin (good for general accessorizing and also for positioning that fantastic hood) and I will buy that dress in that color.
Actually i thought kelseys was the nicest
Need fully made this episode! You go Ned
Ned's mustache is giving him power
Of course eugene shows up for this episode...
The fact that I would wear all of the dresses...except Zach's I'm sorry that's not a flattering pattern and that's my favorite dress-form.    ... But like why does Eugene have such a nice body like he suits the dress to the point that he could be the mannequin and I wouldn't have know he was a guy if I saw him from afar.  Surprisingly, I think Ned did VERY well-especially with the bodice and fabric choices.
Im such a eugene fan but ned dit the best, he suprised me so much, eugene already had a leg up for having experience. LOVED THEM ALL ILY
Love this serie !
i wanna see kelsey in eugene's dress though!
I need Kelsey to join the Try Guys permanently
Ned was ROBBED
How about, "The TryGuys wire a house for electricity and Try to not burn it down "?
Ned was robbed!
why kelsey looks so different
This video was so well edited that I actually entertained the possibility of Ned beating Eugene in a sewing task for a moment
Didn’t watch it yet but I know Eugenes will be good yeah holy fuck that’s amazing
Kelsey dress is the one that people will most likely get at the store... Their comments for her was abit unfair...
guys in dresses 2021
love Neds energy in this!
I’m sad Keith isn’t there 🥺
Zach is adorable😌
Y'all should sell Eugene's dress on your website! I would legit wear it
I literally made a dress last week without instructions!! Surprisingly easy and fun!
Oh God the moustache, Ned has finally completed his transformation into a dad.
Ned was robbed! His construction was way better, Eugene's dress was basically just flowy fabric put together by few seams
Zach is wrong. He does make things with his hands, they're called mistakes...
Biggest try guy betrayals: Zach losing the bagel competition and Ned losing the dress competition
Is this a different “Kelsey” from Eugene’s cocktail episode?
Oh my god Eugene is the clitoris 🤩😱
Zach telling us to make dudes in dresses the next hot thing like we haven’t done that already 😂
Ned making a dress with a moustache is unsettlingly sexy
I love Kelsey so much. She is fucking funny, cute, witty, and wild!
I think my grandmother has a house dress with that exact cloth 🤣🤣🤣
Does anyone know where Kelsey got that pink sweat suit she’s wearing in the video ?
I know I’m getting old when I think “I’d wear Zach’s dress laying around the house after work”
He said a sexy version of my mom and my mom called lmao
I'm so proud of Ned taking a bold risk and his dress is sooooooooooooo beautiful
I love zach and kelsey's friendship, they're the kind of friends i NEED when taking insta pics,i love how zach gave her poses and emotions
personally when I look at ned I see adam Sandler from hubbies Halloween if he was a ginger.
NED WON BY FAR. DID YOU SEE THAT POWER WALK?!?! AND THE TOP!!! IM AMAZED
I don’t usually comment on videos but I would love for u guys to learn some fun basic science from Ned. Like very. Bill Nye inspired.
i dont like blonde keith.
I love how Ned didn't have pants for most of the time
due to youtube removing community captions your video tend not to have captions when they come out, Please add captions into your videos, they are way more accurate and help a lot of people, like this so they can see!
Ned put so much more thought and effort into his design.  He had a much cleaner look.  If he had come out with a wig and accessories, would he have won then???  He was absolutely robbed!!!
Eugene’s dress is giving me serious Kylie vibes. As in Kylie Minogue can’t get you out of my head video vibes
i feel like kelsey should have won. i mean look AT THAT DRESS. I WOULD WEAR THAT ANYWHERE. its so cute and vintage.
More of Kelsey guysss
Ned was super cute in this video just having a good time and making something he liked.
I want Eugene's dress.  Immediately.
ok but with all the stress of the election this video is EXACLTY what i needed.
Loved this episode! 😍
Are u kidding me?! Neds dress was by far the best! Why does Eugene always get all the credit! This was one of the first times somebody did a lot better than and Eugene and Ned wasn’t even appreciated!
"tiktok teens or kpop stans" zach knows where the internet powers lie
Eugene is ready for Drag Race.
More Kelsey! She's always so fun to watch with the guys!!
As pretty as Eugene's dress was.. Ned should've won this one. Had Eugene's dress been completed? Then it certainly could've been a closer win.. but there was too much fabric bunched up top. In my opinion, anyway..  For Kelsey's dress.. that lace bit around the waist drove me nuts. The shape was pretty alright. I think the lace around the waist would've been more complimentary if it was part of the top area of the dress and the rest of the dress, waist down, grey.  Zach.. whyyyyy the lace..? Love the v-neck pattern though! And the placing of the lace.. but mixed with that pattern it was really granny. I think if some lace was placed as a belt it might've been a bit cuter.  Ned's dress was great. I love the use of multiple patterns, the chains, the belt piece.. the writing? Very ambitious and executed well. Plus he got the curves in! Sure it might not have formed well against his body.. but the dress would certainly hug the curves of another person! And it tends to the curves, I find, more than the other dresses.  I think I sensed a bit of bias coming from one of the judges.. but that's just me. Overall for people who never made dresses before? You guys did great!
without a recipe made ned a baker, i wonder if without instructions will make him a seamstress 🤔
I’m gonna need like 100% more Kelsey in all future episodes 🙌🏻   Such sass, such joy 🌟💖
Eugene’s look is amazing! Deceivingly simple but it’s complex and transformative. I go for him on the win cause I can wear that out for damn sure. They all did an amazing job cause I can’t even make anything close to Zach’s.
Even tough Ned did great, I do think that Eugene deserved the win here - I would love to have his dress, to use it as different styles and also have not an uncomfy corset, but a big hood and cape - it's just such an awesome piece of clothing! I hate to wear dresses normally, but I would totally smash the party with Eugenes dress! Respect though to all of them-3h is not a lot of time!
Kelsey is soo preetttyyyyyyyyyy uwu Aaaaaaaaa
Zach knows about the power us kpop stans hold
Uhm Eugene won, his dress was amazing, Ned's was great too but it didn't have the style of Eugene's
I would've loved to hear more from the guy judge, the girl in the middle kept talking over everyone
My bets on Eugene, gonna slay this challenge as always.
I would totally wear Ned's dress. It's a cute dress idea
All Ned needed was an earring and the look pre-dress would've been complete
not me simping over Mari-
Making a controversial bet: Eugene wins
*Woop..Woop* Eugene won!! (Eye roll) Every "Challenge".. How predictable..
it’s the day after the election. it’s stressful. biden needs nevada. i need the try guys. thanks for making my day better.
I think Ned should have won. I’m not as surprised with what Eugene created but sure as hell was not expecting that from Ned!
Last weekend I started to learn how to sow this make me feel very good.
25:16 I got so engrossed in this I forgot what I was watching 🤤
Bruh the vídeo isn't over yet but ned made a fucking corset with a hammer, he deserves win
The first time she smoked what?? Did she say meth? Wtf
I would be sick of making this videos of Eugene always won even if someone did something better. Ned should’ve won hands done. Way more work went into it and I bet had the waist line been slightly higher, they would’ve picked it. But since it hit right at the hips, they didn’t see it as flattering. Lame.
I love Kelsey and Zach taking Instagram of each other
I loved every dress so much but Ned you won in my heart!
I love Kelsey so much
Me watching that at 2 am at a schools night and now waiting to make a Dress 👁👄👁😂
But like Ned did that! I am impressed!!
Zach looks like Nona lol
I really want to make Ned and Eugene's dress now.
i get so fucking exited whenever they post
Ned was Robbed!!!!!
I was so surprised how beautiful ned’s dress is
I love Kelsey
am i the only one who was super surprised when i found out that 3 out of four of the try guys.... are sStRaigHt
I like kesley shes pretty and funny but man she really is the type of person to go to a hotel for a vacation during an international pandemic
But it’s not femboy Friday
I don’t like Ned’s mustache
Ned should of won :(
Ned is like a spicy Ned Flanders now.
ned should've won 😭
Everyone is saying this, but it needs to be heard more: NED DESERVED THE WIN  and Kelsey impersonating Keith LMAO
Eugene what fabric did you use?! Your dress is stunning and I am tempted to recreate it! If I do, 100% giving you credit!
I would love to buy Ned’s, Kelsey’s, and Eugene’s dresses😍
Ned should be the one who won. Anyway, they are all doing a good job
My hip measurement is 40in just like Ned!
Lmao I fucking hate Zack’s dress so much it’s hilarious 😭😭😭😭😭
I love Ned's Moustache! moustaches are IN and I'm all for it!
“What kind of dress would Keith make?” A daddy’s favorite, wrinkled liked raisins
Eugene wins fucking everything and I'm here for it!!!!❤❤❤
a dress should be way easier to make than pants, yet they struggled so much more with this
Ned’s moustache looks awesome
Okay I adored Zach and Kelly's little photoshoot moment lol
I spat out my sandwich at Zach's face when he realized he sewed over the armholes
One day YUNG JEONG will be the biggest artist in the music industry...manifest 👁💫🙏🏽💯
Me trying to listen to Zach about his dress but seeing Ned in yhr back at like 15:20 Ned...why are your pants already off lol
We need more of these Try Guys runway 😂😂 with more time
Am I the only one that was bothered by Kelsey not helping Zach out of his dress? Yes it’s a competition, but I’ve never seen one of the guys outright refuse to help another one & it was really off putting to watch.
Was it just me or was it weird that she said "do you think you have a bigger but then me" saying it to Ned and bending down so Zach can see I just thought it was a little inappropriate because Ned has a wife and Zach has a fiancé.
Dresses are hard to make WITH instructions! I automatically give points to anyone who set sleeves.
i just want to say ned hand drew designs and was looking bad asf out here fuck the judges choice
Kelsey: if zach wins... Zach: DO Not COUNT ON IT
15:41 *flashback to Try Guys Try Cringey Couples Halloween Costumes of Zach in the birth canal*
please do this but make tshirts
Personally I would have placed Zach in third. No mercy for false pockets!
All Ned needs is a rocker choker and he's good to go.
Did anyone else get RuPaul's Drag Race vibes when they started talking about double sided tape, glue and being sewn into the dresses
Ned can actually pull off that mustache really well lol
I hate Neds dress so much, it’s honestly just ugly. Eugene deserved the win
Oh my God its NED FLANDERS
WTHHHHHH NED SHOULD’VE WON😭😭😭
the judge's for SURE let personal taste affect who won 🥺 like yeah, I can agree that ned's design feels dated howeverrrr his completed work and effort make up for it and the SUCCESS of it as a dress, made me really proud!  eugene's was beautiful too with its solid color and draping but there were parts that weren't even finished...  NED WAS ROBBED 😫
Ned was robbed!!
Kelsey!!
I’m actually SOBBING at the fact that kinetic cosplay is in this😭😭😭
when will you have lily marston on this show i demand an answer good sirs
I like Zach's "Mimi" dress the most🤣 I don't know why. I think it's cute.
NED WAS ROBBED
Kelsey's comment about how you have to shove your items up your ying yang to be able to hold anything since dresses don't have pockets is so fucking true. God I hate that dresses don't have pockets. It pisses me of so much. I mean dresses in general piss me off...one the lack of pockets, two the lack of pretty options for plus sized people, three the weird measurements (like I'm bigger on the bottom then on the top so sometimes dresses are too big on top for me [which is odd saying that since I'm still fairly big on top as well...]), and four...the sleeves. Or should I say lack of sleeves. I personally don't want to show my arms off. I would love to find some dresses that have "male t-shirt" length sleeves as that length really covers up my problem area. Dresses are so pretty and fun to wear but when you have a weird body shape and have problem areas...dresses are a nightmare.  I love Eugene's dress so much...that back...the way it showed off dat ass...and the cape! Ned's was amazing too. I totally had a punk/emo/goth phase in high school and I had some clothing that looked like that so it completely fit in with that style (and I love the confidence it gave him! he should wear more dresses lol!).
Ned ... Proud of you. ^_*
This kind of makes me want a collab between The Try Guys and Mr Kate
I'm a fashion student and was stressed out the entire time. Please let them make something easy qq. Also I'm in love with Kelsey and hope to see more of her. <3
Ned was robbed!!!!
Why isn’t she wearing a bra...gross
My question is how did Ned know that much about corsets?   I think he was secretly preparing for this all along!
NED WAS ROBBED!!! HE SHOULD’VE WON WTH
NED WAS FUCKING ROBBED!! Creativity, construction, maximum ball ventilation... WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?!? A travesty.
I love kelsey's comments lmao
I haven't watched the video yet but I'm betting 5 bucks that Eugene's dress is gorgeous
Ok, but Ned is so hot in this dress. The shoulders, the muscles, the confidence. I loved it.
why was the dude judging so rude to zach....? he came across as super dismissive & passive aggressive, but only towards zach. so weird & kinda unprofessional
Neds not only super smart but also super creative snd a great cook
i love the moustache ned
For the people who see this I hope you win a million dollars :)
Who is... who is kelly dajaro?
Did she just say the first time she smoked meth? 8:46 BIG OOF lmao
....... Anyone else just find them pathetic and sad?
If Zach’s dress was in a different pattern, I would so wear it. I thought it was adorable
I wanted to see Kelsey in Eugene's dress
Eugene’s fabric selection was very smart. Plain, rich color fabrics like that always looks pristine with the most basic cut and his dress shape was very elegant so it looks really regal. But, yeah, I agree with everyone else, Ned definitely should’ve won this one. His creativity and technique was off the charts. Also, Kelsey’s design and the fabric combinations - absolutely beautiful! I would love to own that one! Also also, Zach somehow made that “dress” look adorable... how???????
28:43 damn goth girl is hairy
Okay, but Ned's back muscles,,,,, 👀 I am looking,, respectfully
someone tell me where in the video they say they filmed this pre-covid bc im pretty sure thats still a thing happening right???
THIS IS THE 1ST TIME I TRULY WISHED NED WON. EUGENE'S WAS GREAT BUT NED'S SHOWED SO MANY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. THIS IS SAD/ANNOYING especially since they always say he plays it safe and he finally didn't.
You know that saying “if u had to be alone in a room with 4 guys who would it be” I’d feel so safe with these men😂
I love the emo dress!! Too 2000
THATS WHAT I SAID THE FIRST TIME I SMOKED METH 😂😂😂
Ned's shoulders in that dress. Oh my!
Ned was a *sk8er boi* He said *_see ya later boi_*
I'm sorry, but good god was she annoying
As a seamstress.... this is hilarious.
Ned- first place eugene- second place.
Yo Ned was robbed ngl he made a whole ass corset 😂
I think ned's should have won
Ned made the 5 year old girl Christmas dress
I love how kelsey milks her basicness. Comes in with a Starbucks coffee, takes instagram shots. I love it 😂
Everyone tell Joe Biden to will the spirit of J-Lo. Then he cannot lose.
ok but like I highkey love Kelsey's dress. It's modern but romantic and the different textured/patterned fabrics work together nicely. Smooth it out a bit more and its gorgeous!
Anyone else feel like since Eugene came out, there's been way less of the angst and ultra-competitiveness and now he just seems a lot more relaxed in himself. Like the bit where Kelsey's freaking out near the end and he just sort of glances to the side and shouted "Kelsey you got this!" warmed my big gay heart.
Who else knew the winner before clicking the video?
Ned is my least favorite try guy and even I can see that he was fucking robbed here!
This is my favourite video till now.❤
Wow. This is the only time I’ve been disappointed at a without instructions. Ned- 100% should have won, why judges? I get that Eugene can rock any look cool. But Ned was ROBBED- the perfect construction cutting he hammered EYELETS into that dress, he just did so much more and it feels like Eugene just threw some fabric on and still won. So bogus.
This is the most unexpected episode of Project Runway I have ever seen.
"if Zach wins then the patriarchy wins 😂"
NEDS DRESS IS SOOOO PUNK ROCK
I’m really impressed by Ned in this challenge. Eugene’s styling of the dress with the heels and the wig and the attitude is what put him over the top. Eugene calling zachs a housecoat was really the perfect description of how it turned out, he just needed some pink or yellow slippers and he would have nailed the auntie/nana vibe.
I was sure Ned  was going to win.
Is the try girl actually like that or was she acting like Keith ? I couldn't tell lol
Zack's looking like an Animal Crossing villager with that dress
I love you guys, but could you please include closed captioning for us who are hard of hearing? I just want to enjoy your videos 😭😭😭
We all knew that Ned should won. I love Eugene’s dress but the breast part looks weird and he is covering it with the hood situation..
Is that Kelsey or 2013 Joan Rivers?   Cant be the only one thinking it..
OH MY GOD NED WHAT????? YESSSSSS!!!!!!!  Dude, I'm sorry, but if you ever have a daughter someday, you are going to do just fine. This is a perfect example of healthy masculinity: you are one of the most dude-bro type of straight guys I've ever gotten to know, and yet you can still CRUSH it at creating something feminine. *standing O*
The only Keith reference we didn't get from Kelsey was Daddy's Favorite... which, to be fair, might have been a bit awkward.
Kelsey as Keith MADE this episode. Keep bringing her back, please <3
I honesty thought that Zach would accidentally sew the arm holes, AND HE DID 😁😆 You clearly don't disappoint 😅😂
Eugene's correct when commenting on zach's dress 😂
Yes dudes in dress 👗 😍
NED WAS ROBBED
Eugene is right -I was going to comment how my grandma had Zach's dress, in several color variations -mostly brown
ned's mustache triggers me.
The way they knew we needed this video right now
Ned is so fine yal...how is no one talking about this?!
Either Zach is extremely sun burnt or his sleeves are a tad tight
Ned's dress kind of looked like junko's outfit near the start tbh
Love the logo intro
Of course Eugene must be no 1😒
Ned deserved the win. *smh*
okay so now i want eugene's dress AND pants. try guys pls sell this-
I am so upset that Ned didn’t win. Like yes Eugene looks great in everything but Ned worked with so many fabrics and did the boning and the corset back!!! His was so much more creative than eugenes.
Eugene is literally the Jungkook of the try guys 😂😭 for years there’s nothing he hasn’t been able to do 😂❤️ love them all tho they look amazing
Ned at 10:20 😂😂😂
WOW ! ned go off !!!!!
Miss the subtitles
Kelsey is such a queen she needs to come back for more videos ❤️❤️❤️
Okay but I LOVE Ned's mustache.
You know, eugene kind of looks like Mariah from JJBA pt.3
Where is the cc?
Four words    Neds. Dress. Was. Amazing.
Gosh I am so fcking attracted to Ned in this video
I love eugenes and neds but Ned got robbed 😭😭
As someone who sews for a living, Ned's was #1. Eugene's was unfinished, no details, a piled together shape that was tacked together by accident. Ned had boning, lacing, details, multiple fabrics, it all was finished. Easily number one. I would even say the picnic dress was better than Eugene's, haha.
Am I the only one who deadass wants Eugene’s dress😳 Like where can I get one? TryMerch PLEASE
Mommy's favorite
Zach talking about TikTok teens making dudes in dresses the next hot thing....who’s gonna tel him about Femboy Friday? Boys in crop tops? Hell we got them in MAID DRESSES now. We’re way ahead of you💅🏾✨
I want to recreate these dresses from a fashion designers POV.
I would love to see Eugene's dress professionally made
the hood part of Eugene's dress lowkey gave me violet chachki season 8 finale vibes
Been waiting for this video!🤩
Anyone else miss Keith ?
ned was ROBBED
Eugene looks like the magnet stand user in jojo.
Part of the reason eugene won was because he actually sewed the whole dress no tape or glue. Yes neds dress was more technical but he also used tape instead of sewing the belt on or making it so the belt sat there with belt loops.
I am sorry everybody.  I was impressed by Ned's dress but was awed by Eugene's when he came out.  His won for me.
Wow, Ned!! Your dress was awesome! You really won it for me!! 😇
I am a bitch, and can confirm that I love a goddamn sundress
NED DESERVED IT PERIOD
13:15 boy in skirt is already a thing
this is GREAT but I miss Keith's chaotic energy
this is irrelevant but im watching this video in my new try guys sweatshirt and it is the softest thing i’ve ever worn in my life
Zach and Chelsea's instagram moment :')
Please wear underwear with a sundress 🤦🏾‍♀️
you should've brought Micarah Tewers she would make everything so fun
I love that Zach is a kpop fan
i think kelsey should have one😐✋
I want to see them do a thrift flip
Ned shoulda won because his dress unleashed the inner freak and I love it
Ned you don’t need to be a designer to wear the stache!  It’s such a good look on you - very classic
Ned looks like Mario, lmao 😂
I see no queens, just some silly latin boy in a dresss. 💅💅💅
I love Eugene's dress but it looks not that different from Zack's vagina costume
Yeah, Ned should have won
Kelsey is my second favourite Keith.
I like Eugenes but Neds was way better. He had so many details to it and it was hard to make.
Right off the bat, I want Ned's dress. It's totally something I would wear!
YALL NED WAS HELLA ROBBED
Zach’s dress reminds me of Olive Oyl’s. Idk why haha maybe same silhouette.. Ned did a great job!
Ned is just Julien Solomita
Ned won this one idc. The elements he put in without a pattern or skills, make him the winner in my opinion.
EUGENE HAS TO START HIS OWN CLOTHING LINE
Okokok so crazy concept butttt as a fursuit maker, I’d love to see them try the challenge of making a head it would be so fucking funny bc not only is there sewing but also the foam carving? And patterning? Idk I think it would be so funny lmao
When they said "Say something keith like..." I was waiting for "Buy my chicken sauce!" hahahah
More Kelsey
Zach saying "don't worry about it" is me going through life
IM OBSESSED W EUGENES SHIRT
I'm literally trying to configure how Eugene put his dress together because I want it and I will have it, god damnit
Wow Ned looks GOOD with a mustache ✨👌🏻
Dear friend, our Savior Jesus Christ is always with you. These were actually the last words He spoke before ascending into heaven. Jesus continue the proclaim this promise to all who will listen. People respond to His continual Presence in various ways. Most Christians accept this teaching as truth but ignore it in their daily living. Some ill-taught or wounded believers fear (and may even resent) Jesus awareness of all they do, say, and think. A few people center their lives around this glorious promise and find themselves blessed beyond expectations.                                                  When the Presence of Yeshua (Jesus Christ) our Lord and Savior is the focal point of your consciousness, all the pieces of your life fall into place. As you gaze at Him through the eyes of your heart, you can see the world around you from HIS perspective. The fact that Jesus is with you makes every moment of your life meaningful.               Dear one, say the following 4 words "I trust you Jesus!" in response to in every situation and aspect of your life. Trust the only Way, Truth, and Life....Trust Jesus by receiving Him. I invite you to receive our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection.                   Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior whom died on the cross for the sins of ALL human-kind, arose in the 3rd day and currently sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty. You will then be justified in salvation and blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit. It will be the GREATEST decision you will ever make. ❤️❤️❤️       (Matthew 28 : 20; Psalm 139 : 1-4)
So we all can agree that Ned won 💯
Am I the only one who started to get a bad vibe from her towards the end of them designing the dress?🙁 and her reaction to Eugene winning Was kind of like “why wasn’t me”.
it might be my adhd brain who has taken the time to  make a 3d model of almost everything in her  head, but I don't see what is so hard  to do those ...
I have to say, I am very impressed with Ned’s ambition. It may be because he’s never sewed anything before that he had the confidence to try what he did. Even people that have been sewing for a long time worry about boning in corsets. And the eyelets are actually pretty evenly spaced which is something I couldn’t do (eyelets scare me). I’m also very impressed he knew/had remembered some of the terminology (like the chiffon, boning, eyelets, etc.) He did a wonderful job.  Also Eugene’s dress is very well done and it is definitely something to be proud of, but I feel like he played it a little safe with the monochrome.  I would also love to see an episode where they are given a reference and have to make the dress in the reference. It would push a lot of them out of their comfort zones. Or, if you really wanna be mean, give them a mainstream pattern (like Simplicity, most of them are pretty easy to follow, but that’s coming from someone who knows how to read one. At first it just looks like chaos).  💛💛 I’m sorry this comment is so long or if any of this sounded rude or annoying, I don’t really comment much but I was just so impressed with Ned’s then I got carried away lol.
Wait..... This isn't drag race
Love daddy need wearing "Vote" shirt
This is the one time I don’t agree with Eugene being first place. Neds dres was perfect. Literally had the creativity the execution was amazing. Ned was ROBBED
Southern Nanas and Ethnic Nanas dress the same, it seems. All roads lead to the housedress
Kelsey and try guys YEEES 😭💯
Ned 100% should have won
So sad we missed Keith explaining why he’s making his dress to be all of his father’s favorite things for “Daddy’s Favorite,” but I really honestly missed Kelsey so I’ll deal. But fricken Kelsey mimicking Keith when he loses was perfect. I loved it 😂
I WAS ROOTING FOR NED😭
21:06 Zach: "I also burned my hands, and stabbed myself, A LOT." Kelsey: "Oh, cry me a f*ckin' river!" Kelsey is a vibe 😂
This is my favorite try guys without directions yet!
Her impression of Keith..... Spot on 😂
“guys in dresses, make it the next big thing” it already is zach, youre on the wrong side of tiktok.
To me, Ned is The winner.
Zach: “tape is ok but hot glue is... death?!?”  Judge: yeah.
agreeing with everyone here lol, eugene dont get me wrong, I would go for your dress, the style* and HOOD is a great move, but on the runway or contests so much else had to be included and Ned nailed all of that. Plus Eugene sold it a lot with his general form, and I felt the gloves were honestly one of the biggest touches on the look that wasn't even included in the design. How you sell your look definitely counts, but overall we all KNOW this was Ned's moment lol
So should they do a “Ned was robbed” t-shirt?  😃
Neds the winner
If Keith made the dress... Well, what does 'daddy's favorite' look like in dress form?
14:48 was that a bark?
Kelsey: "Like, if Zach wins...?"  Eugene: "Then the patriarchy wins"  Zach: *laughs in last place* "don't worry about it"
Kelseys dress was so cute.  I loved those phantom pockets.  I know we’re supposed to be all about real pockets, but that was a great idea.
Wow it should have been Ned for 1st. As someone who sews, he put so much more into construction that would take any skilled seamster hours to complete and pattern out. I love Eugene, but its not even fitted to his body. And so many raw edges just make it look like he draped chopped up fabric on himself.
Zachs dress gives me southern white mom boutique for the beach vibes
You really need the curve to go with a dress, you know....
Zach 100% reminds me of Olive Oyl from Popeye lol  This series is a lot of fun.
Moo moo for me Me
Fuck I needed this during the election  Thank u
No « daddy’s favorite » joke from Kelsey ??
Bullshit Ned won 😂🤍
20:48 zach slo mo running out is EVERYTHING
What can Eugene NOT do? Wow
The way Ned sits  in his dress reminds me of how my mom told me to sit in church
Oof Zack's was my favorite just cause it looked the most like a wearable basic dress
can ned make me a dress
Zach: Dudes in dresses. Make it the next hot thing! Guys on TikTok: Is it not already?
Wait you’re telling me that was actually Kelsey and not Keith ? 😳😂😂
It takes me like three days to make a dress
I really loved everyone’s energy in this video
Ned won. I don't care what anyone says, NED WON 1ST PLACE!!! . Eugene's dress was nice but kind of boring as one solid  colour and he just drowned out any sense of a flattering silhouette with too much loose fabric and his dress's construction was relatively simple compared to Ned's yet he didn't even get all the seems finished. . Ned's dress had bone, it had stud, it had eyelets and lacing, it had 3 different materials including chiffon which is had to work with. Ned had a freakin' HAND DRAWN DESIGN all over the top of his dress and added a belt and the whole design is cohesive with a clear outline that is as flattering as possible on his dad bod and brings attention to his shoulders and muscular back. . Ned did the best job in design and execution this time  and nobody wants to admit that another try guy actually beat  Eugene is a fashion competition. . Give Ned his win! Give Ned his win! Give Ned his win!
NED WAS ROBBED
I LOVE WHEN ZACH WAS LIKE “don’t worry about it”
Zach’s looks pretty good 😂
they did very well. fashion designer could be next in the guys career. 😄
Yayyy I missed Kelsey
Zach's dress reminds me of things my ukrainian grandma would wear and I honestly love it for that.  I love the fabric Kelsey used. I'm also in a love/hate relationship with the fake pockets, they look so cool, but they lack the function.  I love Eugene's cape/hood situation, also how well he did with the hem of the fabric.  Ned's is just 10/10. I felt so proud. I might be biased, cause I really like the style. My sister wore it a lot in the 2000s and I really looked up to her. But also construction wise, there was so much effort.
kelsey is fun! hope to see her in more videos
Ned's dress was my favorite. It was so creative and intricate. Grommets and boning!?!?!?! I wish he had won.
Everytime Eugene wins I like him less, especially when he cleaarllyy did not deserve it. And then the speach about how he literally never did this omg... Ughhh shut up
I would buy and wear Eugene's...I'm a guy. I want it.
i love a good wig but this one definitely aint it, eugene's wouldve looked so much better without it. it took it from fashion to homemade halloween costume imo. plus his black hair would look so good with the color of the fabric.
best thing zach has made to date
Bravo Kelsey!
Kelsey is ALWAYS a great addition to these videos :)
Ned should have 🏆  won his was amazing 👏
Ned was robbed!
Why is Zach in a dress so perfect
I love Kelsey
Kelsey brought some raw and exquisite queen bee vibe and we definitely need more!!!
Zach's hair looks so great in this video! It's really filled in well
Kelsey is SUCH A MOOD!!
I think I might borrow Ned’s design for his dress! I love the corset back! I also love the cape/hood on Eugenes.  Also, it looks like Zach was the only person who attempted sleeves, so good for him! Those are the bane of my existence.
Ned made a fucking corset!
Ned got ROBBED!
OKAY WHEN ARE EUGENE'S DRESSES HITTING THE STORES I NEED ONE 🤩🤩🤩
I do love how all grandmas all wear the same thing.   Also people defend toxic masculinity, but I'm like, "look what can happen when you get it go"
As much as Zach usually doesn't do great in these competitions , I always love his energy and comments the most, he's sooo fun to watch
I’m the like 43.7k, moist
Please make Kelsey an honorary Try Guy, she's so salty! <3
Damn I want someone to make eugenes dress for real
Ned nailed this! Just look at the hammering for the corset! Hahaha
I'm so impressed with Ned's dress. It really came out the way he envisioned. So much respect to Ned for always growing and trying. I really feel like Ned's such an underdog in the Try Guys and I love seeing him in every episode.
Kelsey is lowkey annoying lol
Ned so won this challenge 😂👏🏼👏🏼
I love it!! Kelsey go on girl!!!
Not trying to be rude but kelsey is the girl that is quirky
I'm so proud of ned for figuring out eyelets!
Ned only has 3 moods, and THATS IT!!  Clean shaven  Bread  Mustache And that’s all he knows how to do
I would totally wear Eugene's dress, great job 👏👏
Seriously Eugene: take up sewing!
I think Kelsey spiked her own drink and  got slowly more and more drunk
Dang was that girl's coffee spiked???
i love seeing ned branch out and learning new sides of him!!! such a great episode of without instructions
Ned was robbed tbh. These are fun, but it’s boring that Eugene always wins.
Ned looks like he is fuming at the end
I really liked both dresses but I felt that Ned should have won
I want to sew all this designs like right now! Is it normal to adore every single one? Please keep doing this sewing challenges ❤️ I enjoyed the pants video too 😁
I have seriously never clicked so fast😅
Eugene: Well if Zach wins, the patriarchy wins- Zach: *DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT*   we love an insecure, no toxic masculinity KING 👑
Ned was really smart to go with a grunge look because of the history of it being diy, safety pins, raw edges, etc can be explained away because they're a statement... and he STILL rocked the construction!
I’m kinda curious about what Keith would’ve come up with if he was there 😂😂
I would purchase Eugenes dress!
25:41 peep Neds posture lol ♥️😜
Ethnicity doesn't matter. My grandmother had a closet full house dresses. I kept my favorite one when she passed away and it makes an awesome old lady Halloween costume.
NED👏WAS👏ROBBED👏 Also Kelsey has wider hips while Ned’s booty pops out more so it makes sense that they tied. Also Kelsey and Zach taking Instagram photos are my last two brain cells🧠
Ok but I love kelseys. That but finished with a zip and pockets, yes please.
Zach and Kelsey's dynamic had me in stitches!
“This is the dressiest dress I’ve ever dressed” 🥴🤣
Ned won in our hearts.
The Try Guys Make Stuffed Animals Without Instructions
Kelsey was the perfect substitute for Keith 😄
Lose the stash
Ned was robbed
Zach really manifested the femboy hype, didn’t he
justice for ned!!!
I LOVE this I’m an avid seamstress and love these guys. I adored the pants one. My husband and I had tears down our faces from laughing at zachs pants
Anybody gonna mention Zach and Kelsey..............
Ned with a mustache is like a discount Freddy Mercury.
Since everything Keith makes is daddy's favorite...
Wow. I actually disagree. I think Ned crushed it. Eugene's looked too all over the place. Kelsey if she actually sewed stuff would have done well.
I can see the appeal of Eugene's creation but yeah, ned was robbed haha
Ok why the hell Zach looks like my OWN GRANDMOTHER
I really really dont like the chick. She is obnoxious. It almost made me skip the video but since the idea of making dresses was good and i like try guys... i tried not to cringe at her too much
I was literally hating on the stash as he said that i was like 😳😳(not hating but like questioninh😂£
Ned should've won
Not a fan of Kelsey in videos. Wish Keith was there instead.
Public outcry! Ned was robbed!!! The corset! The RIBBING! The TECHNIQUE!!
I like Kelsey she is very funny can y’all put her in more videos plzzz
I want to see Kelsea in Eugene's dress
I actually like eugene’s dress tho
Tell me why I didn’t leave work early to watch this when everyone else did.
Ned messured his butt with his phone in his back pocket!
I bet you’re watching this video with your legs crossed 😂💖
Ned should have won. Also that Kelsey chick was super annoying
Omg I just measured my butt to and I'm also 40! bruh
The Try Guys: Make Dresses Without Instructions Me: *PROJECT RUNWAYYYYYYY*
Ummm... I would wear Eugene's dress in a heartbeat. I adore it.
NED SHOULD HAVE WON HOW
Love this serie
22:44 definitely the best part of the entire video
Can we have an episode of Try guys making a song without instructions I think people would love it :>
Not me just screaming "SEAM ALLOWANCE" at my computer
okay but the real question is where is Kelsey's jump suit from?
25:42 Ned’s posture is impeccable in that corset - knees together, back straight. What a beautiful demure young lady he looks! Smiling like the grunge pop Southern Belle he is!
Kelsey needs to be a regular addition to the Try guys/ Try wives family I missed her so much and i had no idea how much till now 💟
My God, Eugene's dress was spectacular!
Ned, alwasy the bridesmaid, never ne bride
well zach, we have been trying to get men to wear skirts for the past two months so yay! :)
i LOVE Kelsey!! she is so fun and funny in this video, and she gets along really well with the guys! :)
Disagree. Ned should've won. It's better made, and it's more refined. Eugene's dress is fine, but it lacks any details, and the hoody was rushed.
cmon ned should be first!
I love Kelsey and I think she did a great job! I think everyone else did a great job too, except maybe zack who looked like a grandma who was wearing a nightgown while on vacation to hawaii lol
Aw Ned looks so pretty and cute
I wanna wear Eugene’s dress
ned won the public´s choice
I needed this today! Thanks y’all!
Eugune's dress is pretty but Ned should have won this competition. He was very creative and he worked so hard on it. It's just amazing.
I love Kelsey!!! I missed her!
Spoke cottagecore is a style I need to see more often
NED WAS ROBBED!
I want eugenes dress so bad!!!
Ned we love you but you’re more hung up on this mustache than anyone else.
HOOOOWWWWW
I think that the costume designer should, please, make real, finished versions, for them.  And they model them next
i would choose ned’s dress for creativity, but if i would wear Eugene’s if i was going outside. (idk i don’t like a lot of skin and i loved the hood)
Oh thanks for your uploading video, The Try Guys.
13:13 little does zach know we got dudes in skirts happening
This is the only time I’ve actually felt disappointed in the outcome, so glad everyone else in the comments is already raging about how Ned’s dress didn’t win. Usually in these episodes we can understand how each person got that placing even if it wasn’t what we were thinking, but I actually don’t understand how Eugene’s dress got higher than Ned’s this time.
Release a dress line!!!
Ah, the mustache obsession has begun for Ned. My man has been on this boat for the last 4 months and he is so annoying about his facial hair now. But honestly it's cute.
They're so creative. If I had to do this I'd just make a t-shirt dress.
I’m sorry Zach crawling in his dress though😂
I have been saying for years that skirts and dresses should be made for men. And once that happens the dress industry will probably go in a very interesting direction. But mainly to allow (most importantly) straight males that what they look like and what they wear doesn't define anything about them.
No. More. Kelsey.
you do not know how much we needed this rn
Try guys put together a bike or tricycle without instructions
Ned definetely got the spirit of punk clothing: just fuck around with half a plan and try your best
If they replace another try guy in a video and they DONT get Kelsey to fill in, I don’t want it
REMATCH
Ned was robbed!
They learned how to knit, how bout socks without instructions
I need Kelsey as a try wife, or just... around more
I dont like facial hair but the moustache really fits Ned😆
The shirt Eugene is wearing for the intro is fucking fireeeeeeeee 😊🔥🔥 Where do I buy it ...
I just realised in the end she really embody Keith with the blue squares her dress is blue and white squares and what colour does Keith where the most blue and whit squares
Ned was robbed. Boning is hella hard
Ned: "My new best friend: double sided tape!"  My man, are you sure you're not a cosplayer?
I'd love to see Kelsey's dress made by a professional. I love the fabric choices and the overall design and look, I'm picturing in my head how it would look if it had a professional construction and finish and I'd wear the hell out of it.  But when Eugene walked out with that wig and those gloves and heels, it was over for them bitches
I honestly liked Zach's dress a lot 😂
They should’ve had micarah tewers as a judge lol
never sewed dresses in their lives but they know how to thread a sewing machine? :D
I am in love with Kelsey on the try guys
who’s the annoying girl
I love Eugene's dress he did a wonderful job, Ned did too and honestly he really did capture the angsty vibe he was aiming for. I am glad Eugene won though.
HI
I need to immediately known where Kelsey's jumpsuit is from!!
love kelsey
For neds dress I would have made the skirt start at the bottom chain
I kind of love Kelsey? Her mean girl energy is so powerful
Omg its Kelsey!!! Missed seeing her with the try guys! She's soo funny!!
Ned did amazing he should have topped
I think we can all agree that Ned's the winner in the comment section.
Kelsey: Uh.. I've got a couple little like suprises up my sleeve that I'm pretty excited to show the judges that I don't think any of these other F-ing losers have...  Me: She has to be talking about her boobs right? She was literally adjusting her bust when she said it.  Me 2 minutes later: I stand corrected.
NED WAS ROBBED
Eugene slayed. Is anyone surprised?
Another day of petitioning for “try guys try nail art without instructions” judged by simply nailogical
My Latina grandma has a similar dress as Zach made 😂😂 So yes Eugene is very correct  “thank you for trusting my queerness” is me when someone tells me i can do something
Ned deserved that first place he made a CORSET, HE MADE BONING, HE DREW A PATTERN ALK OVER THE TOP THTA ACTUALLY LOOKED SO GOOD (AND I WOULD WEAR AS A OVERSIZED TSHIRT/DRESS MAYBE MAKE IT INTO MERCH), HE HAD PINS IT WAS SOS TYLISH HE HAD TWO FABRICS ON THE BOTTOM HONESTLY HE WAS ROBBED AND I AM NOT HERE FOR IT HE LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE DRESS TOO AND THE MUSTACHE WORKS WITH IT TOO AND IT WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA THIS LOSS WAS UNACCEPTABLE
Eugene was of course the obvious winner
Ned needs to lose the mustache.
Kilts baby!  Just order some custom kilts!
I would 100% buy both Eugene and Ned's dresses. Like, make these available as specialty Try Guys merch. I need them.
They should make onesies
Do people actually think Ned’s looks good or are y’all trolling?
ZACK! KILTS ARE A THING START WEARING THEM! my husband wearsva kilt almost every day
Eugene’s went from “mother of the bride” to “Mother has arrived”  Edit: capitalization.
My favorite is neds lol
KELSEY WHAT SHOES ARE YOU WEARING
Ned definitely won, idc what anyone else says
I'm just waiting for Ned to make a dad joke
Hahaha bring Kelsey back for another episode 😂
Neds dress was so good it makes me feel inspired to recreate it for myself. He definitely should have won!
Eugene's dress was extremely creative. A hood on a classy dress?! The versatility blown my mind. The open back!! Different opinion here but I love the monochrome choice. Credit is paid where it's due. Ned's design was ambitious, but it wasn't revolutionary. Honestly believe that I'm seeing design choices on a classy dress I'd never have thought of! 🤯🤯
I liked Zachs the best 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Ned looks hot as always
Ned did great! He did so many things in such a short time. Although creativity is stuck 20 years ago, he improved soooo much. But I do believe that Eugene is the rightful winner here, it's fresh, creative and elegant
Zach: men in dresses make it happen Literally almost all of gen z: WE ARE TRYING
KD got KO'd! That's no half mer, that's a ful mer.
No joke if Kelsey was able to clean up the back I think that dress could totally be sold everywhere
I feel like Eugene was super proud of Ned.
I think if Ned had gone for the transition between fabrics at the waistline instead of hips, it would have been a more updated look, and he might have had a better chance. Just my thought.
I want them to have like a full week to make a peice and see what happens
Eugene POPPED OFF
Another episode of: Eugene is good at everything
Zach: Gen Z, we need you to make guys in dresses a thing. Gen Z: we have boys in skirts does that work?
As much as Eugene's dress was amazing. I think Ned's was better. The dress had ribbing for goodness sake!
Omg yessss MCR reference I live for that 🖤🖤
Come on...NED 👈was the real winner, Eugene did not accomplish the 1950’s “new look” AT ALL😅
Today November 4th kinda became dress day at least here in Spain a ton of kids went to school in dresses which was all started by this one guy. From what I saw online it was a lot of girls and some boys that participated. Pretty crazy that you guys are posting this video TODAY of all day
I think Ned should have won, just saying 😐
Yes Eugene !!!!
Zac posing Kelsey for her Instagram is EVERYTHING. what a sweet friend
Please don’t replace Keith anymore with that girl. She kind of ruined the vibe of video. When Eugene doesn’t participate you guys don’t replace him, and I think that is best to do for all the guys
Now try making pants without instructions
I love Zack’s triceratops sweat suit 😍 I love you Eugene, but Ned should have won! He did great!
CAN I SERIOUSLY MAKE A HUGEEEE SUGGESTION——— Can you guys make an episode of all the clothes you guys have made but DONE BY PROFESSIONALS the right way and how they look 😍🙌🏻😍🙌🏻  Cuz I’m still in love with Eugenes Pants and the dress and Neds Rock Dress 😍😍😍😍 and the other chicks too lol sorry Zack lol  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEE MAKE THIS EPISODE 😍🙌🏻😍🙌🏻 and maybe it can be sold on line? 🤔😬🙌🏻
Kelsey!!! I love her
i pray some day i have a friend with the dedication Zach had to nailing that insta-shot...uh.
Try guys actually LEARN how to sew?
Kelsey: Doing her best Keith impression   Kieth: ( secretly watching this video at home) HOW DARE YOU
8:45 wait what? Are we all jus ignoring that? “I’m gona use the crack on the floor as my guide, that’s what I said the first time I smoked meth” If that’s a joke a like her sense of humor, if it’s not then... um I dunno
everyone talkin' about ned being robbed but can we talk about how cute kelsey's design was?? also I MISSED HER y'all should bring her on more often tbh
nah, they are wrong. *we all agree Ned won*
Okay I hate Ned’s dress but he should have won
New was robbed
Eugene is always robbing Ned of the spotlight. I think Ned is the funniest try guy .....
Ned putting off Freddie Mercury energy.
I know their vibes are so totally different but you have no idea how badly I wanted Bernadette banner to judge them (and not just on their dresses but also just on loud ridiculousness in general)
Can somebody please explain why does Eugene have such a sexy back?
why Eugene has to be so perfect at everything???!!! hahaha!  Eugene dress is soooo pretty and wearable..
I normally don't like mustaches but it actually really works for Ned
Lol ned's shirt one day two late
I feel like the ONLY reason Eugene beat Ned is bc his can be made into several styles  That being said they shouldve at least tied for first  He was deffo robbed
Ned 100% got robbed
Ned should totally win this one!!! I demand a redo‼️😂
Ned looks like Freddy Mercury
Ned was robbed!!!!
Im going to use the crack on the floor as my guide. Thats what I said the first time I smoked meth!   How is she THIS funny?!
I’ve been seeing a lot of comments saying that Ned should have won, and although his is very creative. I agree with the judges, Eugene has the best looking dress, it looks like a real dress and it has some shape to it. Ned’s dress just looks like two panels of fabric with silver bits all over it.  I’m not hating on it, Ned was really creative and I did not think he’d do something like this. Its just my opinion, but I personally think Eugene deserved that win.
I love Kelseyyyyyyyyy
ned should have won.
Omg Kelsey looks GORGEOUS in this video
we all know ned won.
Kelsey is your drunk aunt at any family reunion
I fucking MISSED Kelsey so fucking much.  I am subscribed to her channel but all her videos are an hour long. I wish she’d do fun stuff like this all the time. I’d watch every one of her videos.
14:56 ned and kelsey where both me in my teacher training class.
Ned with the vote shirt and the blue bandanna. I wonder who he voted for😂
12:49 Just an NB timestamp. I wish I could wear the same style of clothing as Eugene's dress all the time, unfortunately, there are the standard issues: money, confidence, and no time to make stuff myself...  But seriously, purple, a hood, elegant as fuck, this is what I wish to wear. Just give it pockets and I'll die of joy.  Ned's dress would be my second choice to wear myself, I actually think maybe he and Eugene should've shared 1st place, but prejudice because purple... I agree with the judges. Even though I know that it might not be fair.
zach's dress looks like the dress mormon sister missionaries in hawaii wear
i feel like ned was a sad boy in this. ned are you okay, boo
Wow that angle at @16:48
I want Eugene to just collaborate with Ned and Kelsey to design dresses. I think it would be cool if they could design some clothing for a runway show. I basically want to see a fashion from the try guys.  Actually what if all the try guys (including Kelsey because I love her commentary) work with designers to create mini runway looks. Then they get judged like Project Runway.
I love Kelsey's energy lol
i know nothing about sewing and know so much about baking, is that what non bakers felt like during without a recipe?
Where’s Keith??
I missed Kelsey. I hope she is doing well ♡
NED SHOULD HAVE WON!! :((  His was more complicated, it turned out like his original idea... also the punk+corset+moustache look was AMAZING and he looked HOT.
Eugenes: Classy, but a bit simple. It doesnt adhere to his original plan of the New Look and it feels like the cape was a bit of a turn of luck. Till beautiful, but mmm lacking. Ned: Several details and techniques used, made a print,added chiffon layering, added boning and EYELETS to the corset ( eyelets take forever!) and def matched his original plan and vibe.  In conclusion, Eugenes dress was good, but Ned was ROBBED
Man, Ned be looking kinda thicc
Your next “without instructions” should be a chair!
OKAY NED'S BACK MUSCLES
When Eugene started busting out his fashion designer knowledge,  i was like he is going to win.
Kelsey's Varieties of Starbucks Coffees are Sending Me
NED IS THE WINNER! I DONT CARE WHAT THEY SAID!
zach im happy to inform you that dudes in dresses/skirts are in fact a hot thing on tiktok😌 they're called femboys and they're amazing
How did Ned NOT WIN
I was thinking because we dont have Olympics you could do trying to learn Olympic sports. Like try guys learn Curling, Archery, etc.
Zack actually did it! That's a dress! I'm so proud 💚
Ok I do like Eugene more than Ned no doubt, but common man Ned went so far out of his comfort zone. Wes really has changed him for the better.
NED WAS ROBBED
the hair on her legs...
Ned’s sexy thighs at @15:39 !! Oh ned you did it again
Eugene as Carol (Cate Blanchett) honestly made my day!!
in my opinion like most in the comment section I think Ned should've won.
I'm sorry I would've put Ned in first place
‚’I’m gonna go with CREATIVITY’’ do you even know what creativity is? From which side Eugene’s was creative? This just gets so boring with Eugene winning those comptetitions. Repetetive and boring.
I loved both Eugene's and Ned's dress but honestly Eugene's fit better. If Ned did the pleats like he was originally going for he'd definitely get my vote but the dress was just too tubey on him. That being said super proud he took such a risk and made such a statement! I stan a king <3
NED WAS ROBBED
that was really goood
ned's just seperately had so much to tackle. he did boning, multiple fabrics, wrote on it, eyelets to make it a corset. Eugene's was stunning but he should've come second
i love eugene's dress but i think ned should've wonnn
the TRY GUYS vs. each others parteners/wifes
I NEED CAPTIONS YALL CAN PAY ME TO WRITE THEM FOR YOU HONESTLY BUT I THINK YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE ON UR TEAM MORE THAN CAPABLE TO DO SO WHY CANT YOU JUST MAKE THE CAPTIONS >:(
Bts in skirts - it happened quite a bit - Im just saying and i love it
Spooky cottage core 😅
Eugene looks like hes really cold and has wrapped himself up in a blanket 😂
Why does Eugene always say it's your competition to lose all the time
i wanted Ned to win, but if we are really honest with ourselves, Eugene's dress is better.
Would anyone else actually wear ned's
IT'S NED FOR ME
Everyone is rightfully impressed by Ned's dress, but I really think it fits the place he got. For me, the skirt absolutely killed the vibe, there's no form to it and the silhouette is just a box. If Ned had gone with his pleated skirt or even made a simple flair skirt with a lighter weight fabric, he would have won a deserved first place.
This is like watching Rupaul Drag Race, especially with the hot glueing shit into other shit
Ned you're #1 in my heart and by the popular demand you won this.
im simping for mari just gay gorl thingz
omg at 27:22 you can see a string of hot glue coming off Zach's hem lmaoo
Ned, Eugene, Zack, Kelsey is the order I would put them in
Eugene looks like a queer version of james from pokemon
i love this series!!! can u guys do something for the holidays too? like decorate holiday sweaters??:))
im sorry but NED WAS ROBBED OF HIS CROWN FOR THIS ONE
Everyone's saying ned should have won but I didn't like his. I loved eugenes though.
Zach: ‘Make guys in dresses happen’  No one: Harry Styles: Exists
Was eugene wearing his shirt inside out?
NED WAS ROBBEDDDDDD
I'm sorry, Eugene, but Ned was ROBBED. Boning??? Corsetry grommets??? Chiffon - which is a notoriously difficult fabric to work with??? All that plus the styling/creative elements should have nabbed the win.
We all need a Zach photographer in our lives
Keith: "I wanna make a dress for my dad so I asked him what he finds attractive "
I need more episodes with Kelsey
Ned killed it!
Not sure if they mentioned it, but any idea why Keith can't join the challenge? Thanks!
21:55 eugenes southern accent came out so hard ! I’ve never heard it before omg
ZACH DONT WORRY THERE IS A TIK TOK TREND OF DUDES IN MAID COSTUMES (THEYRE ALL DRESSES)
Kelsey and Eugene, i still remember them trying all the alcohols..they have good chemistry
If Zachs waist was brought up to his natural waist and a little more cinched in the waist it’d be like a 50s costume dress cause the flare he got is really good
Ehhh, I feel like Ned got robbed here. The number of different components and the complexities of each one...harder to pull off and it looked great!
Did Ned lose weight? He looks slimmer.
next level sexy nun
For some reason I was half expecting Eugene to incorporate alcohol in his dress somehow
Didn't even have to click to know who won.
OMG cant wait for the next one PLUSHIESSS
this had me dead
Kelsey made the BEST Keith
Ned amazed me!!!! Incredible details and the effort and creativity were mind blowing. Really proud of Ned for hard work and stepping out of his comfort zone so confidently and boldly. You won the audience's vote ♡
Zach's hair is looking so good!
Next line of Try Guys merch should be a collection based on these dresses, tbh
YES EUGENE!! Dresses with a hoodie/shawl! That is such a LOOK!! Now i need to get my ass on designing a few!
Kelsy is so chaotic, I love it haha
Ned looks so upset that he didn't win :((  he should've won
Ned: casually drawing an anarchy symbol
Kelsey : I like Summer Dress cause you can wear no underwear under it. Me looking at Kelsey : Yeah even in that video you're not wearing a bra, I like your style Kelsey.
I am very pissed though, and sad :( ned should've won
Ned really popped off
Here's what I think: 1. Ned 2. Kelsey 3. Zach 4. Eugene  I would totally wear Ned's dress. Kelsey's dress was fun and  I feel like I would probably wear it if I could. I put Zach before Eugene because imo Eugene's dress was so bland and to me it looks like he just grabbed som fabric and swept it around his body and head. It is straight up boring. Sure Zach's dress was not that great... but it still had some charm to it and it felt like it had personality. Eugene's had no personality at all. It's a crow next to 3 peacocks and even though I love crows, a peacock is more interesting to look at.
As much as I adore Ned's dress his waistline was at his hips! This is more proof twords the notion that men don't know where their waist is!😂
NED WAS ROBBED
Everyone should know at least some simple sewing techniques. It's usually viewed as a feminine thing but fuck that. It's just a skill. Everyone wears clothes, knowing how to mend them should be standard practice in my opinion.
this is a good group lol I love when Kelsey joins the guys
OMFG I DIED OF LAUGHTER WHEN ZACH SEWED HIS SLEEVES LMFAO
These are my favorite kinds of videos
Yall I love Ned's creativity but he really wasn't that robbed by Eugene, I mean I stan his eyelets but did yall see what Eugene made? 🌚🌝
i think keith isnt here because they diddnt want "daddys favorite dress"
eugene saying it "ethnic people have a grandma" me thinking: zach looks just like my abuelita
Zack giving Kelsey instructions on posing is giving me L I F E
ned... pls get rid of the mustache
How does Ned always seem to be pantless in these videos?
Them “I want this to fit me very well!” Also them *uses female manikin when they are male*
Kelsey and Zach taking pictures of each other just screams bestie vibes and I'm living for it 🤞🏻😁
When in doubt, butterfly stitch. tons of extra seam allowance, stitch first wrong side to wrong and then pinch it in and stitch ladder style along the new fold.
I requested this!! Doubt you guys saw my comment, but I’m gonna pretend you did and be so so excited to watch this!! 😂
Try Guys videos are SUCH a great break from everything going on right now!💕 Its so nice to have a distraction from politics and Corona 😌
Yes boning is so hard
NED WAS ROBBED
Zack sweety its called drag
“That’s what I said the first time I smoked meth”   If you didn’t already know Kelsey was from Florida, then that sentence is your confirmation  I love her 😂
I kept thinking man zach just looks like mi abuelas. But a man
Ned should’ve won 😭
Ned in that dress is doing things for me that I didn’t even know I needed
Why isnt Kelsey on every video??? I LOVE her!
I ADORE Zack’s
stop commenting you thought ned should win, it doesn’t fucking matter it’s comedy
Where can I buy Eugenes dress? Omg love it
Come on guys, Eugene's was awesome but Ned was robbed!
Neds mustache reminds me of tht New Girl episode where Schmidt grows his mustache and Nick freaks out !! 🤣🤣🤣
Im sorry Eugene, but Ned was ROBED! He´s dress was SO good
I love Kelsey shes an amazing person, lauren too I really enjoyed her on the  podcast
Listen, Eugene's dress was great... But ned was so ambitious, and result was great
11:45 Is... Ned, a secret gay dude?
I wish Professionals could remake these (right) and the guys with Kelsey do a runway with the professionally done dresses. Maybe a runaway with all of their w/o instruction clothes!!!
I don't like Keith's outbursts, but watching Kelsey do an imitation was hilarious.
Eugene looking like a ghost type gym leader
I LOVE KELSEY OMG
Ned was the best IMO since he really pushed himself creatively and structurally (with boning and corset). An amazing job all-around
Zack said dude’s in dresses when we already have guys in maid outfits
Kelsey: you don't have to wear underwear or a bra Me: (laughs in 35 year old lady)
I CALLED IT
I think we  can all agree that we love Eugene and all believe that his dress was beautiful and that he is a very talented individual but Ned was ROBBED he slayed in that dress and went so far out of his comfort zone and it completely payer off
Kelsey trying to be Keith is the funniest thing!
As a 15 y.o. girl, I would wear the shit out of Neds dress. I would buy one right now if I could.
hope keith is ok but all the dresses were lovely i really can't pick a winner!
Tbh, I wished that they had asked Ashley (Bestdressed) or Micarah Tewers to participate in this video or at least judge it. :( But other than that, it was a fun video.
Just wondering why no one is social distancing? No hate, just want to understand since I felt they were taking things very seriously at first but now are just not doing so anymore. Again, not trying to stir up stuff just wanna know if I missed something they may have said about this.
NED WAS ROBBED!!!!!😔
I’m going to be honest. I’m not a huge fan of Neds moustache
As somebody who started using a sewing machine at 3 years old I'm not sure if i'm going to absolutely love this or find it moderately infuriating...  (my parents didn't intend for that to happen, my mom just didn't realize I'd been paying such close attention that I would have the ability to start sewing away by myself when she left her sewing room to answer the phone)
Eugene is so unfair hahaha love it
this comment is a petition for Kelsey to become the 5th Try Guy, every like is a sign
Why no Keith?
Ned, I'm really feeling that mustache!  Hope it stays.
Stop relying on that bodyyy...😂
Everytime I watch y'all's videos I want to do this stuff as well. You guys make it look so fun and it inspires me to try new things and that even if I mess it up the first time I can still enjoy it
As much as I LOVED Eugene’s dress, I feel like if Kelsey’s dress was made an actual thing hers would be the one I actually buy for myself
Do they not... have pins? To put the pieces together to be sewn?? Zac’s over here using binder clips...💀
as a kpop fan i’ve been workaong on making it the next hot thing for a while thank u
Ned's took way more work and precision. HE CREATED A TEXTILE BY HAND. Eugene draped a cowlneck shift. Eugene's styling was better, but Ned's details blew me away. The grommets, the belting, the fit in the bodice. Kind of Vivienne Westwood vibes.
As a fashion design student, I'm so impressed with Ned! He did a corset look with boning with grommets, like that takes a long time. He also did so well in sewing because he flipped it and the seam on the waist looked good. He did a layering with a chiffon on top of a plaid fabric. He was so creative with the accessories and made a print on the fly. That was all in 3 hours which is mind blowing! So proud of Ned!  Omg I never gotten so many likes on a comment before lol Thanks everyone! <3
69!!!
I wish ned did a slit 👏👏 and rougher edges on the bottom
Eugene has a better figure than me 😭😭😭
eugenes so hot bro
Kelsey looks so much better since she stopped drinking I’m so proud of her💕
Kelsey's was cute❤️
Every comment  nEd gOt rObBeD      (Not saying I disagree tho)
ned totally should have won
I think Ned should've won tbh
Try Guys: Sitting apart bc of Covid.  Also: High fiving each other at 11:58 😂
Ned deserved to win. His dress had everything
I'd like Eugene's multifunctional dress in the Try Guys clothing line
IS EUGENE WINNING OVER NED IN THIS DRESS VIDEO MORE CONTROVERSIAL THAN THE ELECTION?! Lol I agree, NED should have won
every 7th grader explaining to the principle what they did on the desk: 16:25
ned should’ve won point blank period
I'm kinda happy Keith wasn't here cuz would they even be able to upload this if he was there making a daddy's favourite dress?😮😂😭
Ned, we stand with you <3
Wow! I think you guys all did amazing! And loved seeing Kelsey! Awesome challenge!!
I really wanted Ned to win I loved the easy A inspo😍
Ned walked around that corner ready to kick my ass and steal my girlfriend--and I don't even HAVE a girlfriend! Damn!
I hate Ned’s mustache so much😡
zack just made the latino abuelita dress and i stan
6:54 Ned: *went to yale* Also Ned: *uses calculator for 12*4*
love the try guys, love without instructions!!!
Holy shit I love Ned’s dress, I would deadass wear that dayum 💗🙏
ned should’ve won look how DOPE that was 🤩🤩🤩
Ned and Eugene should have at least tied. Eugene's looked good and he really sold it, but its shape was... not good (with that added hood/cape piece). Ned's looked okay, nothing really special about it, until you realize that he had to do so many challenging things like the eyelets and boning!
This series is slowly turning into "lets see what eugene is good at "
Since Eugene alwayyssss wins because he is literally the best at EVERYTHING lol even when he doesn’t try, why don’t we take him out of one competition Lol
Okay but can we take a minute to appreciate Neds booty
Ned won, change my mind.
Period Ned. He did that.
Kelsey: What kind of dress would Keith make? Me: Daddy’s favorite
Zach: say something keith-like Kelsey: **does whatever that was** Me: **chokes on my sandwich bc laughing**
I'm proud of Ned
Ned dress is first place
Zack makes a pillowcase 😆
Everyone's already said it, but Ned should've won. Eugene scraped by on the fact that he's got a very flattering cinched waist, meanwhile Ned hammered grommets into his dress to make a corset, drew on patterns, layered a skirt, connected multiple different fabrics..........He planned and executed a very complicated design. He should've gotten 1st place.
All my votes go to Ned 'cause damn girl, that was hot. He killed it. Also I loved Kelsey's impression of Keith in the end. Nailed it.
It would have been better if the just tried to fit it according to the dolls
13:13 **maid dresses intensify**
Ned was robbed!!!😭
I did not like Eugene's.
rip ned shouldve won
I think Ned's was the best, creativitywise and also how it was made. Then Kelsey, because I would wear this dress myself. Eugenes was the most boring one, but still better than zachs, which really just lokked like a grandmadress
When is Eugene going to come out with his fashion line???
Thanks Try Guys. I really needed this right now!!! 🙃
But like ROMANS SHOESSS
Was shocked by the ending, looked into the comments to see what was up and I’m glad we all agree: THAT VICTORY WAS NED’S!
Okay this makes me want to see them make historical garments.  Each guy chooses an era and a piece of clothing, that's be hilarious
literally love eugene but no ❤️ ned’s dress was immaculate✨✨✨
I'm crying!!!! I LOVED Ned's look 😩😍❤️ you could tell he was so proud of it and it looked so well done. Great job Ned 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Ned should have won. Eugene dress tho nice and creative it was confusing and I got lost in what in wanted to be
Ned's creativity with Eugene's execution in basically any challenge would be so flawless.
So the Patriarchy won in the end and I'm ok with that. 👍🏾 😂
There is so much more to Neds dress I’m really sad that he was roobbbbeddd. I mean i loved loved Eugene dress but the way Ned lit up !
I totally need Eugenes rainbow shirt!!! 👚🥼👔🌈🌈 does anybody know the brand?
I nearly always think Eugene should win but bed put in more effort and I think they probably would have chosen his had it looked better on his body type. It isn't his fault that his body type didn't fit the style of dress because that wasn't what they were going for they were going for creativity which ned clearly won, construction again ned put more effort and did a lot better in construction, and is it a dress? Well both are dresses so they tie in that fact.
Ned was robbed though I agree
I’d like to get Ned’s mustache on the National Sex Offender Registry.  Not Ned.  Just the stache.  You don’t want to know what it did to qualify.  All I’m going to say is...hedgehog, foil balloons, and mango-flavored cream.  You fill in the blanks.
Kelsey is the BEST!!!!!! Love her.
Ned literally has a geometrically identical ass to a Hollywood actress
Zach: Mentions k pop stans and men in dress me (an ARMY & MOA): I know BTS did photoshoots and/or performances with dresses, skirts, fishnets, lace, corsets, and other traditionaly women's items and products. Tomorrow X Together just had their minisode 1: Blue Hour comeback, members sporting crop tops during photoshoots and preformances. The k pop scence has been breaking gendar norms and toxic masulinity for years, from beauty products, jewlery, atricles of clothing, how they carry themselves and many other aspects. It's not uncommon to find male idols waering cl;othing marketed toward women. Fellow k pop stans please join in the comments, I want to know how others are breaking the boundies and your favorite moments. 사랑해요 (saranghaeyo) ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤💕💖
Eugene's dress looks like the dress, his character would have worn in their D and D game
I loved Ned's dress
I’m obsessed with Ned’s cooking and sewing skills...WOW!👏🏽
I love Eugene and everything he makes and does but HOW DID NED NOT WIN 😭
I fucking loveee Ugene dress but I think Ned should of Win I Mean, have you Seen the efforts and how concentrate he was! I also love the style of his dress so different from what we expect from him normaly. Good job 4real, you impressed me
i love eugenes dress but ned should've won
I feel like I'm watching a low budget drag race LMAO But can we just talk about Eugene's beautiful rainbow shirt? It's too pretty...
try guys do acrylic nails without instructions ?
I love Eugene's dress.. I'd definitely buy this!
agreed with the majority that ned should've won but also can I just say that zach's dress was not THAT bad lol
I legit love kelseys dress
"This is Try Guys, there's a lot of butt sweat" is super on brand
there's no captions on this video :(
Zach lowkey popped off
There is nothing more heated than these comments debating if Ned or Eugene should have won. And honestly, I'm so torn too. Ned has the punk spirit, boning, a hand-drawn print, and a grommeted corset. Eugene has versatility, a monochrome color scheme, an open back, and an overall timeless style. Could we just call it a tie?
As someone who got back into sewing & dress making over the uk Lockdown pt 1 I’m EXCITED
ROMAN!!!
13:09 soobin has entered the chat
I hope kelsey is in future videos, I love her!! ❤
Ned should have won. He really put a lot of effort.
Why does Eugene look like Mariah from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure
Don't worry Zach, a lot of Kpop stans are already working on dudes in dresses! We got you! 😂
YES KELSEY!!!!
Me with my butt measuring 42”
ugh i didnt mean it to be sweet- Eugene
Making a corset is really difficult and it fit him pretty well. I am sorry but Ned was robbed in this challenge!
Ned do be looking like Ned Flanders 😂
Eugene made mommy's favorite
I agree with everyone else, Ned was the clear winner. His dress also fit him so much better imo :D
I'd totally buy and wear a dress like the one Eugene made. Just saying.
Damn Ned pulled this off soooooo good I love it
Watching Eugene's sewing machine bounce on the flimsy table as he sews is giving me pain. 😑
24:23 Eugene clapping like a mom
Ned should have won. His look was more clean and looked purposeful, whereas Eugene's dress was just piles of fabric and some cuts— of COURSE you can get different draping "styles" from that. Should've gotten second. Oh well.  I wouldn't buy either dress since one looks really 2000's and the other looks too old for my demographic. So that's not a factor for me. Plus, the rubric didn't state "marketability"?? But ok. I don't hate Eugene, I just think this was a wrong call and I'm bored when he wins challenges like this because it's predictable lol.
yeah, ned was ROBBED
Zack looks like Olive Oyl
I watched this as I made a pair of pants and a shirt.... where I made the patterns myself    This was more entertaining
I think Keith was just tired of not winning, lol
24:34 Kelsey with the Keith face to camera 😂
I would kill to know where Kelsey got that jumpsuit! Not literally, but.. maybe.
It should have been Ned.
This was really cute to watch. I love Ned's 💘
Try Guys make Dog Houses next Pleaseee
This felt like an episode of drag race
I think Ned should have won!
You can't tell me that wasn't "Carl Poppa" playing from 9:41to 10:10. 😂 I can sing the lyrics to that melody.
Should've been a tie between Ned and Eugene, both dresses turned out incredible!
when we all agree that Ned should have won 🥰
Sorry but Ned deserved it! Had the most creative components! Also seemed the most finished construction wise and most ambitious
I get the fact that she's exaggerating but Kelsey was really annoying in this episode
No one talking about the Mean Girls reference? 😂
I am a simple man. I see Kelsey Darragh in a Try Guys video, I watch immediately.
ok eugene did slay with his dress but  ned deserves this win. His dress was literally so iconic and he looks great. It was all around better, even tho eugene also was very good.
Eugene,this man can look good in anything💗
Back offf of Ned he is marrrrieddddd
I actually agree with the judges🤷🏾‍♀️😂. Ned's dress was "the most" well constructed, but he was neck and neck with Eugene with regards to creativity. Eugene's was well constructed and would appeal to a larger demographic. Since his was the most "wearable" I see why he won.
Eugene being accidentally sweet is hilarious
Can I buy Ned’s dress? Please?
This is giving me such Project Runway vibes!!
Congrats Zach, you made a very funky pillowcase.
Zach could have recreated the JLo Versace Palm dress with that fabric.  I am surprised Eugene did not suggest it;).
Do I need to watch this? Eugene is going to have a pile of shit for most of the time and then present one of princess di’s dresses in the end.
Ned did amazing, his creativity in design has grown so much, we all know he deserved first place honestly.
I absolutely loved Ned's confidence and all the work he put into his dress, it's nice to see him try something bolder instead of going for the easy stuff; but still, I'm kinda getting tired of the comments about how he was robbed and Eugene didn't deserve first place 🙄
Ned Eugene  Kelsey Zach   That's where I'm at.
I usually dont find mens backs attractive, but Neds in that dress threw me for a loop
Ned was robbed. Love Eugiene’s dress, but Ned was the one who demonstrated a lot of different elements and techniques. ROBBBEEDDDD. Will wear both Ofcourse.
Loved this episode. Loved seeing Kelsey with the try guys again. Need her to come back. Love the chemistry she has with all of you.
I ferl like eugene's looks better just because it has a huge piece of fabric covering parts. (But also hems!!) :l  Ned's my winner def!
Ned should’ve won, the fucking creativity he had. Holy shit
i think ned won honestly
Ned totally won. I disagree judges!
I wish they invited bestdressed and titled her professional thrifter
Zach looks like RBG on a tropical vacation.
I really wanted Ned to win :( Eugene was amazing ofc but I feel like Ned realllly put himself out there this time
came straight to the comments to check if everyone else agreed that Ned should have won
I think the only dress out of the lot that came close to what I would buy is Ned. I owned many pieces in the Abbey Dawn clothing line and that would definitely be something that fits in. Eugene's is way too much for me but props to anyone that would wear that.
Was anyone really surprised Eugene won lol he's really amazing and great at so many things
Kelseys dress looks like something I would wear to go on a walk where I take like a million instagram photos, Zach's dress looks like something my native american grandma would wear, neds dress looks like something everyone at my school would wear (but in a good way), and eugene's dress is something I would wear to like a fancy event. All of them look amazing
Ned should have won!
How ca the try guys make dresses w/t instructions yet I struggling to sew one w/ step-by-step instructions
Damn Ned, It really looked great! Eugene Stan though hehe. I think they went through " what would I were more? " Maybe, but  his boning was so great ^^ really happy for hum, but Eugene... I'm a fan girl haha   MAybe construction or creativity made Eugene win, I think more creativity now, reflecting on It, because he made something that can be so many things haha
Did the girl just say "that's what I said the first time I smoked meth"?!?! When she's talking about the crack in the floor? I'm not offended lol. Just odd in a try guys video 🤣
Honestly, if Kelsey's dress was better constructed I would wear the heck out of that. The fabric choices were actually cute, and I love the  look.  So that one's my personal winner. I liked Ned's a lot as  well though.
Ned should have one.
I'm surprised they mentioned Zack's V neck and not Zack's FREAKING SLEEVES??? Everyone else just said no sleeves bye and Zack...
Ned was robbed :(
I don't think zach is aware about boys in skirts
13:12 oh Zach, if only you knew the wonderful world of femboys
Ned was robbed 😤😤
if Eugene had worn Ned's dress, everyone would have lost their minds and named him the winner right then and there
I haven’t finished yet, but based on the comments it seems like Ned has won audience selection
“lauren diy” bahaha
omg ned was robbed he killed that
i loved both eugenes and neds but ned should have won. his was form fitting, had boning, and fit a theme perfectly.
Who else loves Project Runway and thought this was amazing? 🙋🏻‍♀️
I also love how when Ned gets a mustache he suddenly learns how to make dresses.
I love how Ned and Eugene were making there dresses and then Zach and Kelsey are just there taking Instagram pictures 😂😂😂
I love neds confidence and that he went out of his comfort zone !!! Love your creativity Ned :)
I love zach's dress that's a fricking everyday dress n I would buy it
Ned was robbed
Ned def should have won
To Zach: I don’t know about current Kpop stars but a lot of 2nd gen and some 3rd gen male Kpop stars wore dresses, usually because they were covering a girl group dance. I know some wear Halloween costume dresses for their Halloween vids and sometimes the groups would have one member dress as a girl for a sketch. Jo Kwon wore dresses for performances and I’ve seen Ren from Nu’est model for a magazine wearing a skirt. I’m not very observant and too lazy to do research so comment if I’m missing anything because I know I am
I’m sorry but Ned should’ve won. It’s all about the effort and detail.
not complaining, just curious, why was Keith not in this episode?
Love Ned's
YES KELSEY!!! I missed her.
Ned got fucked.
Ned should’ve won
Y’all robbed my man ned.he put so much effort and creativity into his .I say we recount the votes ....idk
Is anyone else getting hormone monstress from big mouth vibes from Kelsey? 🖤
Ned's print didn't get enough glory
Lmao why is zach so me
Men in skirts. Zack knows whats up
Nothing to do with anything....best of luck to the states on the election....hooe it goes the right way. Everyone here in the UK is routing for Biden. Got everything crossed for yaz!
Eugene can you make me a dress like that i would wear it wear it all the time 🤗🤗🤗💜💜
Please add subtitles to your vdieos. We are watching from Europe and my mother has a hard time understanding English when spoken fast 🙈 thank you!
How long did they have? The first time I made a dress it took me like a day and a half, I'm impressed since they clearly only had one day
EUGENE COULD MAKE HIS ONLY LINE OF NON-BINARY CLOTHINGGGG YEYY
Eugene looks better in this dress than i would ever look. Beautiful <3
I better hear an update that Ned actually wins next video :)
Kelsey's impression of Keith was actually pretty good, especially at the end
neds was the best 👀
"make it a hot new trend. dudes in dresses"  me on tiktok liking videos of dudes in maid outfits: 👁️👄👁️
ned was ROBBED
Ned looks like OG pit crew guy
I’m obsessed with kelsey’s outfit. If anyone knows where she got it let a girl know!!!!
ned should’ve won 😐
I understand Ned took a risk, but Eugene deserved that first place. His dress looks like it could literally be worth hundreds at a real store.
What the heck Ned should have won!!!
Zach's dress reminds of ms frizzle from the magic school bus
Anyone else love Zacks little meow moment😂😂
Keith. Eat everything at either chipotle or qdoba please please please
Idk why but Ned looks so sad after the result..Ik it's just a fun video but I'm so sad for him..we love you Neddd..he put so much efforts...you were supposed to winnn🥺 yours was the bestttt
Honestly I'm proud of ned maybe we should get more full throttle ned when he leaves his plain dad zone its honestly more entertaining and fun
I love watching Kelsey imitate Keith, she's spot on
ned is my winner i loved all their dresses but ned's style and craftmanship is winner worthy
22:44 The sexiest shot ever *-*
Zack's catwalk was ADORABLE
Yeahhh.. Ned should of won.
Ned! Nooooooo!! Shave it off!!!
Not me pausing the video and immediately comparing butt sizes with Ned and Kelsey (ps I can confidently say I won)
13:11 Us kpop stans gotchu, we already got crop tops goin it’s only a matter of time for dresses 😌
Don't worry Ned. You won, you rocked it :p. Eugen was good as well
my new favorite series; make jewelry or shoes next??
While I love your videos it concerns me that every one in these videos is always breaking social distancing rules and no one ever has masks on. Could you do a video or something explaining why that is , bc it just feels like y’all are unintentionally coming off as unsafe.
Hate the stache ned,love you but I hate that lol,it never became normal
Okay but can we do make extravagant cosplay/costumes next? That’d be so intense. But also then tryguys can ask their significant others if they know what they’re trying to be
I reeaaaalllllyyy thought ned was gonna win
Zach's looks kind of like a pillowcase. 🤔
NED SHOULD HAVE WONNN!!!!!  ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Normally I am TeamEugene, but come on Ned!!! Eugene's concept is gso ood, but it relies to much on thee accessories which he didn't make.  This was Ned's competition.
Eugene really nailed this! It looks so cool on him!
You know Ned is a dad when he busts out a hammer to make a dress
The people demand justice for Ned!
YAs NED! come through Zaddy of two AND made a bomb ass dress?! Amazing! also would wear zacks moo moo not gonna lie lol
Ned snapped! The dress was really cool.
This makes me want to make a dress, I just gotta find the right fabric and time. Currently babysitting my niece and nephew at my sister's house and my sewing supplies are at my house so all I can currently do is draw out designs.
I haven’t watched the whole video yet. But I already KNOW Eugene’s will be gorgeous😍😍😍
Eugene's was AMAZING, absolutely blown away, especially as someone who's made clothing before in classes, it's really not easy, even WITH instructions! Ned had some fantastic construction on his dress, but for me Eugene's was just the best. I loved Kelsey's as well, that looks like something I'd wear out, as does Eugene's, and as always we're so proud of Zach for giving it his best shot!!!!
I love how Ned's half naked in the background 15:12 lol
He should not have got it, Ned made the best. Also the guest was kinda a bitch to Keith. Really missed him in this one.
Ned looks ripped in his dress .. fucking BULT u go girl
Does anyone know what kind of brother  sewing machine they used? I'm looking for a simple one for beginners.
I am Obsessed with Ned's dress. If I wore dresses, that'd be my look.
I love Eugene, but Ned should have won!
More videos with Kelsey please! She's so awesome!
Ned was robbed
Voting for Ned as the best
Ned was robbed! I would wear the fuck outta that dress 😂
Oh wow! I'm super excited to see kelsey in a vid! I've always loved her, and I, personally, think she's hilarious.
I feel like part of the reason Eugene won because his body makes the dress look so nice and Ned's body doesn't do the dress justice.
Eugene, can I book an appointment to have a custom dress? :O
watching ned realize just how much fabric you need for pleats satisfies my inner seamstress
Only if zac new about alt tik tok and femboy Friday
Ned's BACK - HELLO
Female Keith is killing it 🥰🥰🤣🤣
Alternate title: "The Try Guys experience a sweatshop"
yes kpop stans can make it happen lemme just message hongjoong, he’ll do anything for us
at 5:26 when ned was holding up his pattern paper i was thinking  *oh god. the lack of seam allowance. oh no*
AWEE I miss Kelsey. And you guys! I haven’t caught a video in a hot minute but I’m glad I saw this one
I'm gonna need y'all to sell these dresses on the website.
Ned was robbed... I'm sorry but Eugene could wear a trash bag and make it work. And I think that's why he won. Ned's dress was boxy but he  put so much into his dress, he made a pattern, added embellishments and putting boning into a corset!!
Kel’s bracelet  into a mask is iconic!!!
Did anyone notice that their looks correspond to their colors? Kelsey's got Keith's blue, Ned's got a red skirt, Zach's pattern has lots of green, and Eugene's dress is in the realm of purple.
This isn't related to the video content, which was amazing, but I really hope Kelsey wasn't actually booking a hotel for a vacation given the current climate. I have to believe it's a joke after she made a dress to "socially distance" in with a matching mask. 😂
Kelsey is the energy the try guys is missing. Fucking love that bitch!
I wonder where this could go. They're gonna be in their 60s trying to make an electron colliders without instructions
personally, I did not enjoy kelsey's energy. poor substitute for keith.
Kelsey: I’ve got some surprises up my sleeve. Me: you don’t have any sleeves!
As a woman I hate dresses, never worn one and never want to 😑
dude ned had the anarchy symbol, the sort of tartan, the 'corset'. he was robbed 100%
Kelsey's is a Monet: from far away it's okay, but up close...
10/10 Would hire Zach for all instagram photoshoots.
not ned going all harry styles with the mustache
Ned should have won, no doubts on that.  And I found ironic as f*** Eugene won with a dress that looks- form wise- so similar to one which got it's sewer eliminated from the Sewing Bee.    I mean Series 6 Peter's Recicled Jumpers Dress, if you want to look it up.
Zach forever has all the informal looks I want to wear.
i really want zac to win at least one competition before I die. is that too much to ask for zac?
Ned should have won!!!!
Idle Worship
Nah Ned was ROBBED. I low key didnt like Eugene's look and I love that man
I love you guys but none of you are wearing masks and are with a bunch of people
When neds butt is bigger then yours... dudes got a 40 ass I have 38😂
I lurve Kelsey! Does she have a channel?
Im pretty sure Kelsey and Ned pulled a basic instinct at some point on the guys.
15:10 Ned is pant less?
Ned should have taken this one, he put himself out there and it totally paid off, it was cool, complex, well made i liked Eugene's but Ned deserved this one
Keith should be here.
I'm in art school and we have to sew a LOT. Guess what, I'm horrible at sewing
Rip Keith 🥺
Girl Eugene looks like he's the next Disney villain for the Descendants!!
NEDS CORSET 🖤🤎🖤
Kelsey really bring Keith energy   Especially when she was talking about the glue
Who else was worried they were gonna stab their thumbs lol
Zach "Okay less angry like you don't want them to know that you're mad." Damn I need him to artistic direct my Instagram photos.
I love how everyone really did achieve in this episode tho! I thought everyone's creations were awesome. I bet Keith would have rocked it too!!
Unfortunately I think some of these dresses are judged differently depending on the body modelling them
Ned definitely should have won. He worked with multiple fabric, added flair with grafitti and accessories, the freaking corset??? Boning and inputting those grommets would have been the death of me. While eugenes was definitely pretty, its still one type of fabric cut out intricately. His fabric choice is very easy to hide unhemmed sections and the only difficult part would have been maybe the zipper. Ngl kelseys dress was mad cute tho...if it was executed properly
I am laughing. The most basic article of clothing consists of 4 rectangles and elastic or string for shaping. They went too complicated
Kelsey only date black guys
"thank you for believing in my queerness"
ned was rOBBED
more videos with kelsey please!!
I didn't think Zach's was that bad. At least it was wearable. And ned for sure should have won. He really took the creativity and construction to new level
Zach: help pls Kelsey: I didn't come here to make friends
Like if Ned was robbed
Ned should have won! ☹️ Ned was robbed!!!
ZACH, YOURE ALREADY LATE, DUDES IN DRESSES IS ALREADY A THING. REMEMBER THAT FEMBOY FRIDAY IS EVERY FRIDAY GUYS
I want one of those judges that does make cloths to make these outfits with their skills and then have everyone model their new dress. Like when you send kids art into a company to have a push made.
I love that Kelsey and Zach took a break to take some pictures for the gram gotta take advantage of that good lighting!
OML I wanna wear Eugiens dress!
I want Eugene's dress so much
I'm sure some people will disagree with me but I'd like to see less competition and more creative forms of trying things. Like instead of judging these dresses I'd love if they had to wear their dress around the city for a day. I feel like sometimes we see the exact same thing happen every competition and the whole 'Eugene doesn't really try but makes perfection', 'Ned tries super hard, does well and comes second', 'Keith makes something weird about his dad that has something good and comes third and 'Zach stuffs around and does whatever he wants (and I feel like this is partially because he has lost in the past when genuinely trying very hard and doesn't feel the need to anymore)' is getting a little worn out. Idk the competition videos  narrative isn't doing it for me anymore (with the exception of candid competition!).
Honestly, if they don't collaborate with Micarah Tewers for these kind of videos, then it loses entertainment value... Because I know what it could be.
in what what is not wearing a bra easy access for peeing? :P
This is the content I love! Ned, Zach and Keith trying their best with Eugene like a proud mom  Edit: welp I guess not Keith
Eugene's dress is my sexy dnd fantasy outfit omg, the capeee
If you just want to see the judging 17:30
Didn't Safiya come up with this idea when she was part of Ladylike? Did no one think to credit her or Ladylike for this vid? Also isn't Kelsy one of the Buzzfeed employees caught on tape being petty about Safiya leaving to start her own channel? It seems extremely detrimental to align yourself with someone who showed an open disdain for people who do exactly what the TryGuys did. Namely, leaving Buzzfeed to strike out on your own.
Ned usually goes for the safe, conventional choice so i am really impressed with the risks he made, it totally paid off
Ned should have won!!!!
I normally root for Eugene in this series, but Ned's grunge look? Spot. On. The boning, the eyelets, corset, I do wish he did the pleated skirt, but it felt like he had a plan the whole time and really followed through. I mean even the raw edges of the skirt remind me of a something you'd see from the 2000s.
I will definitely buy Eugene's dress but Ned should have won. Ned tried so hard and it made me feel so bad for him when he lost.  I am also still waiting for Zach to win  something :D
Okay, no....Ned was robbed of victory. Eugene literally has way more experience physically in dresses as well as how to pose in them for a shot or a walk. Ned did so much in so little time and put in so much effort. He really deserved more points towards blood sweat and tears....just saying. I don't think I have commented on many videos from them but I could not stop myself.
Ned's dress won for me. The detailing! The snatched corset and the double layered skirt oof. Eugene's was nice too but I felt the back cutout wasn't fitted well to his body and for me his cape was a success by luck. Also ned's dress had so much going on whereas Eugene's was classy but a bit boring for me atleast
I love how zach can take bomb insta pics
As a fat bearded man who has worn a dress I wish they were more popular for dude shits comfortable af
13:10  Dude have you not seen femboys like that IS a thing
4:29 Kelsey: 40! Ned: Nice! *look of utter disappointment*
Hey I also got a 40" butt! Only difference is I'm only 5'3"
ned with that moustache and the neckerchief whilst working on the dress gave me full new york fashion gay
The way I would wear the fuck out of Neds dress
i would actually buy neds if it had a skater skirt and was a bit more high waisted
Love kelsey ❤️
is it just me or does ned have an 80's gay porn mustache
Aww. Ned living in that dress
Damn, I thought Ned should have won. I think eugene’s gloves really tied together the look, but he didn’t make them so it feels unfair. His construction was a bit cleaner, but Ned’s overall was more of a look
Ned's "he was a sk8er boy" hahahaha
I wanted to see kelsey in eugenes dress🥺
Where can I buy neds dress oml
Eugene's makes me wish I wore dresses. Ned's makes me wish I was 19 again.
for once I really wish the win would have gone to Ned. Idk I loved Eugene's but I feel like that was a big win for Ned <3
As a Kpop Stan I love how Zach says we can do anything.
Anyone else think Kelsey ruined it a little? 😬
Honestly, Ned should've won... His dress had the best execution, It was creative because It was different from everything that we've ver seen of him and, well, was definetely a  (good and weareable) dress! Eugene's was nice but too confusing IMO.
Ned deserved that 1st place
Kelsey needs to make more cameos
Ayy Nirvana 🤘🏻🎸
Ned designed a cool af dress but he used a lot of non stitching... (double sided tape) but Eugene looked BOMB he won fair and square cuz he stitched the whole thing...
Eugenes style being the new look and your literally such a fan of that era and have your screensaver with your oma in a dress from his collection ahhh I love him so so much ❤️❤️❤️
Where is @KeithLabs?
Ned should have won, he tried so hard 😭
ned looks like a gay french artist... in the best way
Ned boned!
13:14 we already have. Dudes in maid dress and cat ears 🥵
It’ll be cool if they could be all recreated but by a real seamstress cus they’re all awesome 👏🏻 😎
haven't started watching but i wouldn't be surprised if keith stuck raisins to his dress
I loved this so much
Don't know who Kelsey is but she is pretty hilarious,  love what she brings to the dynamic of these guys. Have her around more
Eugene deserved his 1st place. But the real deal is: WE WANT TO SEE ARIEL AND EUGENE COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER. *THAT* will be a battle of giants worth watching for 3 hours bi
I was going to say the EXACT same thing about Zach's dress: he looks like my Cuban nana HAHAHAHA  Edit: Wait a second guys...I feel like we're on to something here! Do all grannies worldwide wear that same colorful long T-shirty wide cut dress with decorative hem when they dust, cook or do garden work???!! This is amazing! Do they know about it?
*I AM MAD right now* the end result is not fair! (as a cosplayer& clothes maker) Ned did boning in a freaking corset! and he did it right!!!! Ned had construction, he connected everything, it looked amazing!!! heck I would wear it and I hate strapless stuff! he came out of his shell and out of his comfort zone, the fabric choices were awesome, he had layers, everything about his dress was amazing and then Eugene win because of what exactly? I'm sorry I love you Eugene but this was robbed from Ned. draping does not get you a win when there was no construction almost at all and the only reason he added the hood was because of a comment from Kelsey. also the draping is not that great as they made it seem, I'm sorry there's not that many things you can do with that and the fact that it's only one color just makes it boring. the design can actually be pretty awesome with more care and different Fabrics but it's still look old. *NED SHOULD HAVE WON THAT I AM SO MAD.*
As a costume designer and a person who nearly makes their all of their clothing by the end of the video i was crying. Happiness? Anger? Sadness? I don’t even know anymore but 100 points for all the effort they put into the making of the dresses, like its not simple at all so props to them🖤
I want Kelsey in more videos 😂
My opinions as a Sewing Bee fan.  Zach: Nicole's Grandma. The colours even match her Tea Dress Challenge. Ned: Drunk Liz. Kelsey: Greg trying to do his boyfriend's entrance dress at RPDR Eugene: Peter trying to do one of Clare's patterns.
1. Love how it turned into Project Runway at the end with everyone gluing.  2. Love “we have 45 minutes left” *Ned has no pants* 3. Love how Kelsey turned int Devil Wears Prada at the end.
Oh Zach..you're missing out if you're not on femboy tik tok already
Ok but how long untill Eugene starts his own fashion line
I always forget that Ned went to the same high school as me, so when he says things like "I first wore a dress in high school theater," it takes me a second to realize he performed in our very shitty black box!
I really like Kelsey dress
Sorry but I prefer Keith 1000% but good vid regardless
I’m sorry but Ned should have win this round
Did they tell Kelsey to be as Keith-like as possible, or is that just her?
can someone actually make kelsey's dress though like I'd 1000% buy it
Eugene: does something sweet Also eugene: urghhhh
I liked Ned the best He did the most work  with different techniques
I love the front of Kelsey’s dress so much
👨🏻‍🦰
NED WAS ROBBED .
Ned looks like he should be speaking French with that mustache.
I've missed Kelsey so much
Omg I am literally so impressed by each of them, neds is totally my favorite because that’s my style and he looked so happy and excited in it and the mustache on Ned literally made his whole look pop! But Eugene’s was legit runway worthy and is just SOOO Eugene and it was gorgeous! This episode literally almost made me cry 😭❤️😂 way to go guys! The only thing it’s missing is Keith, I’d love to see what Keith would have done, but OMG I love Kelsey (her dress was literally so good too) Kelsey is legit female Keith lol 😂 oh and fracking Zack looks so cute in his mimi lol 😂 ❤️
Kelsey is hilarious(and the Try Guys ofc)!!!!
Who's gonna let Zach know that dude in dresses is already a big thing on tiktok
ngl I just realized Eugene was on Brooklyn-nine-nine in the call daddy scene. Its weird cuz the scene fits him so well
Post malone already wears dresses and shirts  like Kurt curbaine
i really like kelsey :)
Ned should have won.
Kelsey’s Keith impression was spot on and the guys did not appreciate it enough.
Ned did so good tho
NED ABSOLUTELY WON THAT!!
rip to kelseys rotary cutter
We need Kelsey back for another one 😊
When Ned and Lauren were talking abt MCR I internally screamed
why is zach using binder clips 😭😭 i hate it sm
anyone know where roman's boots are from?? in the beginning ! Tsmia xx
I want to see Eugene wearing this on the regular
Ned should have won and ned shave that beard please
Ned was robbed. NED  WAS  ROBBED
KELSY!!!
I don't know if I'm extra distractable today.... But man the music seemed extra loud and... Distracting...  In other news... Ned was robbed 😂 sorry Eugene
Lauren has such great host energy like she can just carry that intro
Kelsie is my spirit animal
Man I love Eugene, but this time Ned really deserved first place!
I wanna be Zacks friend
I, and many Viewers, knew Eugene would be in 1st and Zach would be in 4th before even watching the video.
i love how proud eugene is of ned!
Yall they can just capitalize on skills thet don't have 💀💀💀
Zach made a dress that Kurt Cobain would wear, don’t know if that’s a win or not on the construction but the point stands
22:30 the way he walked in, i'd let him knock my fucking head off before i'd say anything 😂😂 the dress should've won
I loved Kelsey said something about the lighting. I don’t know where they are but I hope it’s their new office building cuz I love those windows!
idk but Zach looked adorable in his dress.
Kelsey was annoying
Is no one going to mention Kelsey's fetch mean girls reference 🤣
Does anyone else now have the unbearable urge to design and make their own dress?? Like I wanna make one for the judges!!!
I think Ned found another calling!
Ned should've won.
Rematch.. Ned vs Eugene. Ned's dress was killer!!! Good job guy.
Kelsey was a fantastic Keith
kelsey's impression of keith is SPOT ON LOLLLLL
Ned should’ve won, hands down it was the best one. He was robbed 😪
ned looks like the human embodiment of here's to never growing up by avril lavigne
Keith should have filmed his portion later. I’d like to see what he could do. But Kelseys  hilarious.
I've lived in over 20 countries, in almost every continent and i just wanna say literally people EVERYWHERE and in every people group wear nana dresses. All the 70+ year olds rock those 😂
Ned's dress is so dope! He should've won, his looked the most constructed and complete. Just bc it didn't flatter his body type as much as everything flatters Eugene, doesn't mean his wasn't the best lol
I love Keith, but I’m only 9 minutes in and I think Kelsea is so cute and adds such a good touch to the video 💖☺️😉
Im down for Kelsey in more content - always.
Ned I am here to say I like the stache
Is it just me or was Kelsey annoying af?
Eugene you could of ended it “I was very MAUVED”  No? It’s ok
Thank you for the distraction today!!!
NED’S DRESS IS NUMBER ONE
Cool episode and I love the colour of Eugene's dress, but I'll have to agree with the other comments: Ned should've won.
All of the comments are about how Ned should have won and I agree.
Did anyone else just KNOW Eugene was going to do a Dior look?
I'm sorry but Ned looks like this uncle who takes a 14 yo niece to sit on his lap and asks if she has a boyfriend...
sk8er boi 👉😏👉
I like Ned's the most, then eugene, then zach, and last Kelsey.
Zach, boys in skirts is in rn on alt TikTok
I'm kinda sad that we didn't get a dress themed: daddy's favorite
comment
Did Eugene say nonbinary clothing????? Jviyxgjdyidi is he an Enby? Or they?   I need answers!!!!!  Also I loved the dress Eugene made *-*
Me over here some that took three years of fashion. Everything was fine and understandable and relatable, then they start using glue. Also did one teach then about back stitching or anything like that.
Eugenes dress fucking blew my mind I want one so baaaaad
I'm a Eugene stan. I love to see him win everything. He's amazing but Ned should've win this. I would wear that dress so hard, and i hate dresses. Ned you're #1 in my heart
I personally think Ned did better, Eugenes wasnt very creative but well put together. I think all of them did fantastic though, sad i was robbed of seeing Keith make a dress and wear it, maybe some day 😤😂
Ned had no right to do so good in this one!!!!!
"I am still trying to find something good to say about this" I-
Ned won Eugene is second Kelsey third and zac last period
thank you for the distraction :)
Purple kinda sus
If Keith's not gonna be in the video, Kelsey will be the only acceptable replacement lol
kelsey is so freakin agressive 😂😂 but i love her
Ned should have won. He made the better dress.
Easy access....to pee 😂
can i just say? i LOVE ned. he was so proud!! i teared up
Ned was robbed, straight up. He embodied grunge, drawing and taping and messy edges is how alternative styles are born baby!!!
Eugene is diamond            But Ariel is Netherite..
Ned was supposed to win :(((
NED WAS ROBBED
we need more candid competitions!!
Your wish is my command Zach 😂😂
ned did so well i really think he should’ve won, he really deserved it
Ned should have won this is outrageous. ILY guys and Kelsey
6:42 Ned: The Musical
I don’t like the look of Ned’s, BUT it does look like it took more effort to make than the others.
Kelsey's Keith impression though 😂😭😂😭😂😭
Lmao ned sitting in that stool is EVERYTHING
Why is no one talking about how good Kelsey looks!!! 😍 she’s always been so pretty but omg!
i need a zach that will do photos like that with me 😂
I want to see a challenge the try guys vs the try wives
I just came here to say that I'm weirdly into Ned's moustache, and my vajay is VERY confused rn
please continue to make Kelsey a fill in !!!
"Zach, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's nEveR gonna happen!" Lmfao I love Kelsey as a mean girl :-D
Zach’s dress does look like he retired in Florida 🤣
Why do they have lauradiy 🙄
Kelsey: I don't want enough Try Guys Also  Kelsey: NAILS 3rd place Keith impression!
Since Zach’s is trash bound, can i have it? Like that’s a lot of fabric scrap.
Can you please do without instructions croche or like Minecraft
Eugene: “If Zach wins the patriarch wins”  Zach: “DONT COUNT ON IT”
This was Neds episode tbh  RIGGED
I’m liking Kelsey, she added a lot to this video I love it :)
Love that you wear the dresses! Total (and nontoxic!) masculinity!
No way, Ned should've won. I want an apology to Ned because that's bogus. HE MADE A FREAKING CORSET.
These are my fave type of videos ahahaha
Ned should have won 😅 but ok.....
yes zach work it
Everyone saying that Ned  should have been the winner . Come on . Eugene dress was flawless!!!
...I make doll dressed and doll clothes and I am cringing sooooo hard!!! I've made a few skirts for myself and thats fairly simple but omg watching these guys!! I love it but I hate it at the same time
I liked Zack's more than Kelsey's. It had a nice cartoony loock to it
I love how every sewing challenge atleast one gets naked
Eugene's dress is so gorgeous ❤️❤️
wow i really thought ned would win this one!!!!
Those are some SMEXY ankles 😘😂
Eugene's dress is like the gown of angelica huston in witches
2:06 Is no one gonna mention the fact that Eugene was initially also going for the same black fabric as Ned??? Neds dress is waaay superior creativity wise! Edit: Also, thank you Try Guys for taking our minds off this desaster of an election for a moment!!!!!!
Eugene's is very Grace Jones in Azzadine Alaia, very fierce!
dude ned shouldve won did u see the fucking finishing of eugenes zipper??? disgustang. not to mention the wobbely bottom seam.
As an amateur sewer, it takes me days to get something made. So, it’s kinda impressive y’all can make something to cover your body in a couple hours
When he said Mari I was like yessss Maricraft but no nooooooo
Zach's dress is truly identical to my neighbours night gown just his is a little short. Otherwise it's the same 😂
Try guys vs try wives without a recipe please
When I read the title all I could think was how is Keith gonna make a daddy’s favourite then when I watched It kinda made sense and we love Kelsey still
i highkey think ned was robbed on this challenge because boning a corset is not easy nevermind being on the clock and that alone should have gotten him the win
I legit want Ned's dress
Ned’s moustache looks so good
Eugenes dress is so nice but I was really impressed by Neds!!!
Kelsey: "Favorite part of a dress...no bra."  Me...: I soooooo *can't* relate.
Man, thank god I'm not the only one who thought Ned really should have won this one. I don't even need to explain why, everyone else has done that for me.
thats bullshit ned should have won
My therapist: Ned’s mustache can’t hurt you
I really hope you guys do plushies with Keith!
Why didn't Zach win?
Of the four Kelsey sits more like a man than rest of them.
Yes Eugene yes!
everyone in the comments saying that ned should have won, but that dress was hideous imo. it was amazing that he did the corset and boning and all that, but it just wasn't attractive, and as someone who has dressed punk/grunge for nearly two decades, i wouldn't even give that a second glance in a store.
Ned: Dad ‘satche engaged
He said to Eugene, “You’re giving me so much thot”
Strong disagree. Ned made his own print.
EUGENE'S SHIRT IN THE INTRO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've missed Kelsey 😂
21:55 EUGENE TEXAS ACCENT CAME OUT!!!!!1
Is it just me or is the background music really distracting?
I love Eugene but I’m actually CRYING because Ned was ROBBED
kelsey screaming with ned pants-less in the background just vibing is a mood
At 14:58 Kelsey is channelling some true Keith energy, it's actually uncanny
While I like Eugene's, Ned's looks the most complete conceptually and construction wise
Ummmm, Eugene’s dress is cool, but it’s not New Look at all. New Look focused on tiny waists and huge skirts. That one is 50’s inspired, but not New Look in my opinion.
This is my favorite feature
BULLSHIT NED SHOULDVE WON
kelsey is WILD
NED WAS ROBBED :(
OMG i was SO HAPPY to see kelsey in the thumbnail like YAAAAAAAAAA finally the queen is back on the channel!!
Eugene, I've never thinks that someone can have sexy back 😅😆
is eugene nonbinary? like maybe this is just me wanting representation of myself but he seems very into playing with gender expression and obviously he could just be a gnc guy but idk
Audio bleeps f**k  Video straight just says fuck
Kelseys dress is a mood. If I saw a dress like this in store (professionally made of course) I would have snagged it. I love the idea behind it. 10/10 design.
I feel like ned should've won, his dress was so complex! I'm honestly surprised he didn't
I adore Kelsey, I hope we see more of her!! XD
EUGENE IS SO RIGHT ABOUT ZACHS DRESS LOOKING LIKE MY NANA SHE LITERALLY HAS THAT DRESS
*Sewists, Rise*
Ned giving some low key Freddie Mercury energy with that 'stache... But like straight.
I’m obsessed with ned’s dress, it’s amazing and exactly fits what Grunge is
Try Guys try and make thanksgiving dishes without a recipe.
8:49 "...that's what I said the first time I smoked meth" ????
Ned looks just like trump supporter😂
im sorry but when I first saw Eugenes dress I thought of Zachs clitoris Halloween costume
okay but out of any of the dresses I would buy Zach's
Ok but Ned deserved to win
I would definitely wear Eugenes dress
Honestly, I think I saw a flame in Ned's eyes
Zach should be on anime tiktok, all the guys are wearing maid dresses rn it's great
I have an idea: The try gals. And they do like manly stuff and, well, like try guys but gals
Thank you for this!
Kelsey is fun!
Ned should've won, sorry not sorry 🤷🏻‍♀️
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW ICONIC KELSEY WAS ON THIS VIDEO?! OMG I HAD AN EUPHORIA EPISODE DURING HER DRESS REVEAL
Ned won in my mind....I mean, the freaking boning in the corset, the everything!!! Hes #1....p.s. of course I would totally buy and wear Eugene's dress AND Neds dress
please post the debating for the placements id love hear it
Absolutely an awesome video. I really love all the dresses and all the effort that they put in that. God bless everyone.
Exception for Zach (sorry Zach) I actually liked all of them. Kelsey’s I would probably actually wear. Eugene was red carpet and cool to look at. And Ned, it’s not my style but I can appreciate it and see that his was well put together and creative. Zach’s made me laugh and reminded me of a grandmas dress...again entertaining but not wearable.
Ned's was so on point 😭
did... did eugene actually make "mommys favorite" in the one episode keith is missing in? REALLY
I LOVE KELSEY!
Neds beard GONE = Neds jokes and energy GONE
My grandma definitely had a dress like that
Aww I wanted Ned to win. Eugene has the ability to make stuff that doesn't make sense sometimes look good, by adding accessories or walking lol. Ned you're the winner for me🥰
Justice for Ned
A competition episode where I unironically love all of the results. One thing about Zach's dress is that, if dresses were designed for and marketed to men, it'd probably resemble his more than the other guys'. It reads like a romper, but flowier.
Ok but can we talk about how Kelsey was spot on as Keith?
Winning ranks for me  1:Ned  2:Kelsey  3: Eugene  4: Zack  The reason Eugene is in third for me is because everything blended together, looks unfinished and looks like it was put together last minute. Now I don’t hate his dress it looks awesome and it’s crazy how he was able to pinch all the end together. I like Kelsey’s because it looks fun and something many people would actually wear. The mask was really funny also lol. We already know why Ned is in first in my book lol
Omg. She's so funny. 🤣 I've always hate when someone comes changes owner of channel but this time it's fucking awesome😆
Shave the mustache if you have self respect
“I’m getting like sound of music vacation vibes” LMFAO
2s in and I'm screaming... Ned... No... Just no....
Ned looks like an actual designer 😂
Trump 2020
Knowing that it was fashion, I knew Eugene would win this contest. His outfit was so beautiful! But let’s just say Ned, Ned, Ned, his outfit was also on point ☝️!  He had a vision and made that vision happen . I knew exactly what and where he was going in that dress and confidence! Love it!!!
tbh zach’s dress was actually really good to me, i feel like the order should’ve been Ned > Zach > Eugene > Kelsey... ned had an amazing dress, zach’s moomoo was actually cool and i loved the design, eugenes cape is what saved his dress, and kelsey’s was all over the place
When did Ned lose his pants?
Zach: "I'm not good with my hands."   Me: Alright alright, *TMI.*
For me it would have been: 1. Ned 2. Kelsey 3. Eugene and well...4. Zach, sorry momo
God I missed Kelsey
Kelsey is so gorgeous 🤩
omg, im so obsessed with eugene
Eugene’s dress was so plain
Me with my huge 50 in. ass: hahaha fools
When Eugene said the thing about Zach’s dress about ethnic grandma’s I was like YESSSSS THAT’S MY GRANDMA
I LOVED Ned's dress and am happy at how well he did! :)
Sewing has been calling back to me. My Grandmother taught me to sew, sitting on phone books! And I have been watching stuff. Annnnd This is the best of all worlds, right. On. Time. ...Lifted this election dreariness-doom-gloom, Sewing, Kelsey, Fashion, AND I am a Try Guys Sometimey Fan-ish type. (NED should have won tho. WT???) Ned, Ned, Ned!!!! You can't just fashion a corset with grommets and lose??
Period
Collect your 'Ned should've won' ticket here
ned totally deserved to win
As a crafter, I am loving this sewing series. It's very cathartic
Why does Ned look like Freddie Mercury, if he were ginger?
OMGGG they try doing  the most popular tiktok trends!!!
Seeing eugene win everytime is getting old 😬
Zach is the best hype man tho
My micarah tewers senses are tingling
Ned won all the way , Eugene's looks like a cloth 😭
Anyone with a bigger bottom than Ned comment here 😆
Definitely missed Keith in this one, Kelsey was a decent fill in though. They should have her on more often
Eugene's dress is the most gorgeous but Ned's is for sure the one I would wear
"We have the same booty" is something I never thought I'd hear someone say.
new idea: Try Guys Help Construction Workers With Something
Something I never thought the Try Guys needed, but Kelsey is amazing with them!
Guys: say something kieth like  Kelsey: cough laugh
I am here immediately after the (probably first) heart stopping thing said today "I wanna do pleats" NO NED..NO YOU DO NOT! Not in a rush and certainly not without a plan.  But hey...maybe I'm wrong...maybe he can make it work...
Ned definitely should have won this one. Eugene should just become a judge for these he's too good at them 😂
Nah they’re wrong Ned was definitely #1
Neds construction was fucking amazing
I do love how they want to be supportive to their friend. But how the 3 straight men, do everything to Not be manly makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm starting to feel sorry for their wives
Ned I am incredibly proud of you. The hard work and confidence you displayed throughout this video is out of this world. Everyone did great but you should have won
Ned should’ve won. Eugenes looks like a complete mistake gone right, while neds just looks amazing. Not to mention the confidence.
Kelseys keith impression are the end was spot on lol. Ask.. NED WAS ROBBED! I think A poll should be opened on the Community page. Put it to a public vote! 😂 x
I'm proud of Zach's dress he had some issues that come from being inexperienced but he made a dress
everyone is taking over screen time and then ned is just quietly nailing it
Ned was robbed!
I was really rooting for Ned cause he’s the underdog but yeah Eugene killed that shit
Ned continuing to do the ASL “I love you” sign (🤟🏻) instead of the “rock on” hand gesture (🤘🏻)  is so on brand for him.
Eugene’s dress is everything 😂😂😂😂
What happened to Keith??
Ned has always leaned into more by the book creations, as in he always makes technically proficient but not very creative builds, and this one is just... it's amazing.   It's extremely well done, and it just completely nails the look. Eugene's look more elegant, and his natural flair as well as build makes it stand out more, but this was definitely Ned's cake to take.
Zach always messes up and I'm starting to think it's on purpose...
This was such a DAMN good video!
To all the people complaining that Ned should have won. You aren’t looking at it like the judges are.  Eugene wins these because he does an incredible job with SELLING what he creates. Yes, Ned put lots of effort into the dress but Eugene put lots of effort into his presentation. Both are equally important in competitions here in the real world when designing and marketing your creations. So yes, Eugene fell shorter in the “design” department but he makes up for it in the “marketing” sector. Because he performed well in the presentation of his dress, he was able to win over the judges and DISTRACT them from certain aspects of the dress that weren’t as well put together. Understood?
I would buy Ned's dress and wear it all day every day. His should have won. Sorry. His dress had so much more intricate detail than Eugene's did.
Did jack and laggy break up????
Zacks looks like  a hospital gown
Kelsey summoned Keith's spirit so hard.  Hell of a job!
Ned's dress is the actual winner... like that was spot on!
Lowkey I feel like the judges were ready to have Ned as first place but were tipped over towards Eugene because they knew he would take the loss so much harder than Ned. Like they were both fantastic efforts but I know as someone with poor mental health and tendencies towards perfectionism/high expectations of oneself and depression over perceived failures losing to Ned for a fashion/design challenge would have cut Eugene really deep. I think the judges knew this and decided it was more important to give him the win seeing as how it was close anyway. Ned will move past this 2nd place quickly, idk if Eugene would have.
I love Eugene, but Ned shoulda won
Ned. Period.
At this rate of comments saying that Ned deserved better we might need a redo of the video lmao like the baking without a recipe video XD
NED SHOULD HAVE WON
I'm very surprised Eugene won??? Like, I certainly don't mind his dress but I think even Kelley's looked better, though the fact that she can't get out of it def hurts her. I also can't speak for construction. But like Ned's dress???? Like, I'd wear that design, I would not wear Eugene's. I'm having a hard time even seeing the shape of Eugene's. Is it pretty awesome? Sure, but it's actually my least favorite XD Ned, you're a winner to me Also ps I love Zack's dress and idk why but it's def nanny style
Honestly Ned should have won. He put BONING in the dress!
i love kelsey literally so much!! she was such a fun guest here, and just gorgeous as ever. this was a fun episode - i really like the "without instructions" series, and the sewing is a really hilarious and fun twist on it!!
Zach: “Don’t worry about it” 😂
Loved Ned’s! You’re the winner in my heart and I wish I had your dress back in the 2000s. Keep doing your great work, you keep getting better and better in these competitions!
Where are needa pants for half the video
A moomoo is a mamamoo fan Zach 😂 (sorry I had to say it)
objectivly speaking dresses are eaier to make than oants and they shouldve started w this one jdhjh
Ok so there are special pliers for putting the loops into outfits....and that fact that he use a hammer killed me 😂
I actually really liked Zach’s dress. It had a fun playfulness to it. It’s really cute
Kelsey is the most beautiful woman in the world
I hope Eugene actually learns how to sew and pattern so he can create those non binary dresses. He has a very good eye for that stuff.
Eugene every time: tee HEE im sO baD at thiS   Also Eugene every time:
Okay it just struck me how cool and important it is that more or less the whole internet agrees that Eugene is like the most stunning, gorgeous, beautiful and handsome person ever all at the same time, and that Eugene also is a gay asian man who plays with femininity and androgynous expression. That is just so cool and important.  I mean Eugene shouldn’t feel some obligation to look gorgeous for the betterment of mankind or anything, but just you know look and dress however makes him happy.  But it just hit me. What expressions and appearances society praises matter, and I’ve never really thought about it before, but everyone thinking Eugene is hot is actually pretty important, even in the grand scheme of things
remember to vote!💙
Zach, if you think men aren't wearing dresses, you're just on the wrong side of tiktok hun
somehow... the mustache fits
Eugene looks so Haute Couture! Why must he look so damn gorgeous! I wish I could be a beautiful as him in a dress!
.... NED SHOULD HAVE WON
Eugene Back OMG
Holy shit Kelsey
yaaasss kelsey
Honestly Kelsey has way too much personality for buzzfeed. She's truly a gem 🥰
Ned won in my heart
guys my butt is also 40, lets start a club. like if ur booty 40in?
The Rachel Maksy viewer in me is dying. But hey, they technically made dresses.
Ned did fantastic. Eugene was amazing though.
I feel bad for Ned, you can see the disappointment in his face:(
Is Ned really going to keep the perve mustache?
"awehw yeah im using the crack on the floor as my guide!"
Huge relief in massive anxiety. <3
The only human being that can beat eugene is Ariel
For me, Ned is the winner. His vision of the dress he was gonna make, and the execution, everything was bang on. Loved the corset thing.  Eugene's dress was not bad either. I loved it. But this time Ned must've won. Anyways, it's a fun competition. Nothing serious. So no issues. I enjoyed the video😊❤️.
Ngl I feel like Ned was robbed cuz I mean he did the corset stuff all by himself and imagine Ned in a full grunge look w accessories. He did so well and took risks and was incredibly creative. Love Eugene, but Ned fricking SLAYED.
The sound I made when Lauren said My Chemical Romance is literally the same as a small dog made when it's laughing
OMG, Eugene was so stunning.
Guys, Ned did better, I always stan eugene but guys, this time, Ned's was BOMB
Ned should have won. His is by far superior.
Eugene - "thank you for having faith in my queerness" Oh honey we all had that faith in you befor even clicking play 😂
alright tryarmys let’s get BTS in dresses  zach demands it
For once I do not agree with Eugene's victory... Loved his fabric, but Ned's dress and just the fact that he stepped so much out of his usual comfort zone... He made the freaking corcet for god's sake, come on!
these r GORG
Sleep in, party in and pee easily in. Rompers are 2/3, Damn!
If you Try Guys answer only one question today, please let this be it.  Eugene, where did you get that shirt?  I need to buy it for my husband ASAP.
Ned is really pulling off the gay dad look today
the judges can't stop simping for Eugene 😂 I mean, Ned came all the way thru fashion-wise and technic-wise but still didn't win?🤔   I STAN PUNK NED LOL
making the skirt is easier in my opinion
AH they all did A M A Z I N g
I think they all did a fantastic job in their own ways. Each dress fits a different person, a different style, a different event. But I don’t think Ned was “robbed” because out of all the dresses, I’d buy Eugene’s. Also I love capes and would love for them to go back into fashion so I think he innovated, rather than recreated a Hot Topic look. My mom would definitely have bought Zach’s dress and I’d buy Kelsey’s if the back was different (and if it had real pockets lol). But to me, Ned looked like he made a dress way too small for him so that it looked like he was squeezed into a tube. Just wasn’t my fave, though I respect and applaud all the work he did to make his look
Okay but Ned 😍😍😍
Kelsey looks so different... Easy on the plastic surgery...
I feel like Zach does not get enough credit in this video.  Look how much he learned from sewing his shark-fin jester pants, and how much better this dress was!  It even fit him pretty well!  Don’t give up, Zach, you killed it, hon.
to the guys: i think the fans in the comments have agreed, although eugene’s was spectacular in every way, ned’s dress should have won.
Watch them sell this on eBay and have hundreds of fans fighting for it
Ned nonchalantly pantless in the background for most of this video made it for me 😂👌
Wow, Kelsey got ALOT of work done...
Eugene is my favorite try guy
I’m a straight guy, but never have I ever been more attracted to Eugene
Hear ye hear ye, the comment section hath proclaimed that Ned is the unofficial winner!
i loved Ned's dress!!
I am liking the moustache. It makes Ned look younger somehow though...
as a Filipino, I can attest that Zach's dress is a "Daster"
Did she say she smoked meth at 8:48 ??? Lolololol
No explanation why Keith isn’t here?! I love Kelsey tho great choice. These are my favorite videos ❤️
They are but buddies!
Eugene started so many new trends for runways 2021!!!!!!
While I don’t sew for clothes I do sew plushies and Ned’s was just so impressive like wtf how did you add so much like stuff in there in that time frame
Ned got robbed so bad.
AHHHHHH  YES FINALLY
You guys are amazing I thank you for this!
I know the construction needs work, but honestly, if I saw Kelsey's dress in a store, I'd totally buy it! I thought it was super cute!
Where are the captions? Why doesn't this have captions? I NEED THE CAPTIONS. PLEASE.
I've made a dress with the BTS and ARMY symbols on it and it was beautiful
ned should’ve won
Oh I really want Eugene's dress! It's teasing but not to revealing and still cozy!
Kpop stans can really do anything. KimNamjoon2021
13:09  sorry Zach. We’re still working on crop-tops.
She's so cool
Strokes are nothing to play and joke around with multiple people have died and my uncle has had so many I cant remember how many he's had but he has almost died from every single one he's had.
But Ned kilt it though!
Ned really should have won! They always put Eugene on first place for creativity and often it's well deserved but this time Ned's dress was objectively much better. He had so many details and elements to it, Eugene's looked cool but it was just a piece of fabric sewed together. Sometimes I wish the judges didn't know who made what, I think the results would be different
I needed this stress relief today
Am I the only one who caught the meth reference?
Did anyone else notice Kelsey just putting flat uncut peices of fabric on her maniquen just like “yes yes I know what to do”
I love Kelsey so much. Her impressions of Keith and her line of "just like your career as a fashionista" had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
I thought Kelsey should have been last then Zack... Ned and Eugene's were my favorite, but I would wear Eugene's more than Neds...
I wanna see Eugene and Ariel battle it out
I need ned vs Eugene vs ariel
Man, I feel bad for Ned :(
Have Kelsey more often pleaseeeeeee she balances eugene out i luv it
Honestly I really wish the try guys didn’t talk about politics, free country and all. But from a business perspective it wasn’t an amazing idea. No hate though.
No disrespect to anyone but I think Ned should've won. Both dresses were amazing!! In terms of actual technique and crafting I think Ned did more i totally would have worn that back in the 2000'''s.
eugene's shirt is inside out and its bothering me so much
Try guys should make "eugene try teach try guys korean"
Ned and Kelsey were definitely my favorites
ned should have won. period.
are we ignoring the fact that neds right arm is bigger than his left
Ned you won this one in our eyes and hearts!!
Zach somehow always finds new ways to fuck up in every challenge... But he never fails to make me laugh.. It is so fun to watch him.. Lots of love to you guys.. A big fan of yours from 🇮🇳 ❤️
That was nedsss winnn come on eugine always wins uugh ned really did that
I love Kelsey so much
I couldn't work out why they were all moving around really fast and kinda jerkily and figured they must all just be high like in other videos.... then I remembered I put the video on 1.5x speed.... nice to know my go to reason was "yeh they high"
Can we have Keith reacts to Kelsey being Keith?
I would love to own a finished version of Kelsey's dress!
I love Kelsey, but I don't think Keith should be getting out of this challenge! He's gotta make his own dress!!!
i think ned should have won 🥺🥺🥺
Ned and Eugene usually do well in any of these challenges!!
the number of adds on this video was crazy!!!
Why do I not see anyone talking about the mean girls referencen
13:14 well zach.... we already have ;)
Was I the only one who thought 'Kelsey' was gonna be Kelsey Impecciche? [rip spelling]
Not gonna lie. I love the 'stache.😌
I absolutely LOVE this episode of Without Instructions! Kelsey was a wonderful replacement for Keith, but I did miss his singing dumb songs that I'm sure he would have done. I was also so glad to see Roman again!! I missed him, and am super glad to see he's well, still dressing to the nines, and proud of Eugene, his flamboyant gay child, awww. LOVED this episode, GREAT energy here!
KELSEY WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR JUMPSUIT IT IS SO SO CUTE
I knew sewing was gonna be next!!!
Ned is my favee so many thoughts and construction in that dress
Zac’s dress would only look good on a grandma the sits on the same chair 24/7 and never goes out
The freaking boning got me... Ned won for me, then Eugene, Kelsey and Zach. This was a great episode but you did Ned wrong, he Dress was Freaking awesome and well planned.
Do a without instructions for the try wives!
Tough choice for sure, but Ned should have won.
I love Eugene so much
What about try guys make jumpsuits without instructions
I'm honestly... Ned did GOOD, I am impressed by him. Eugene I expected to do good but Ned went FULL on. Fulmer in the house for sure.
ooh hautelemode is a channel that would be a good collab for fashion challenges in the future!
Ned. No moustache.
Eugene looks like a mob boss for some reason, and I am here for it 😂
Although I was rooting for the underdog (not Zach but Ned) I can defnitely see the design choices that made Eugene's so good.
Am I the only one waiting for a Daddy’s Favorite dress??
let’s see more kelsey👀👀👀👀👀
Personally, I feel that Ned should have won. The attention to detail and the added embellishments were on point!! Go Ned!! Eugene was nice.. but not my cup of tea tbh; the back and the overall form of the dress was a jumbled mess.All of them tried their best!✨
Can try guys try to make a chair next? 🤣
i’m really loving the stache ned
Bit dissapointed that ned didn't win doe
... I liked Zack's dress. He should have gotten third at least
Ned shouldve won he did so good i love love love Eugene but like honestly ned shouldve won
I loved Kelsey as Keith
I love Mari showing leg hair
“make dudes in dresses the next big thing” ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENING
This are my favorite videos. I can't wait for the next one.
Zach: "Tiktok teens, dudes in dresses, make it happen"  Did Zach predict Maid Boy Tiktok?
Why is there no CC? -.-
MCR AND ROM???😩😩😩
Eugene : wearing a t-shirt, flannel/checkered shirt, jeans with a hole in the right knee and white trainers.   Me watching this : wearing a t-shirt, flannel/checkered shirt, jeans with a hole in the right knee and white trainers.  And it’s the right knee specifically.
we all know who was robbed here
Ned won this one
I want Kelseys dress! But you know like well made. But I love the idea!
kelsey is so funny omg
I love the jumpsuit Kelsey is wearing
Honestly i would 100% wear Ned's dress
I needed this today.
So I heard him say "boneing is really hard" and im the only one that chuckled
i would buy eugene's dress
Did any one else not get this in their subscription feed?
Thank for wonderful examples of non male toxicity.
Ned with that moustache is so dad I’m tingling from the waist down.
Ned won in my heart ❤
Zach’s dress could pass for a Target version of Lilly Pulitzer. Their sheath dresses look like that.
I wore a dress while I am wearing a dress
Did they not have PINS? what is Zack doing w binder clips?!
Kelsey is so funny lol
Ok I am sure she is lovely but I did not like Kelsey in this video at least
Nooo Ned needed to winsss
Zach and Kelsey being Instagram photoshoot buddies was the cutest 😍
love ya eugene but ned should've won
I would pay money for the dress Eugene made.
Good to see that Kelsey took her new position as The Keith seriously and made her dress have blue squares
Is it just me cause Eugenes dress reminds me of that time they played d&d and eugene dressed up as carol
Y'all are scratching my Project Runway itch and for that I must say THANKS
The word that Zach was looking for at 10:50 is “mode”
Watching these gives me hope that maybe I can make my own clothes.
Ned should have won this one!
Who low-key wishes Micarah Tewers could somehow be there 😭
Neds dress was better... it had accessories, different patterns, more character. Eugenes looks like a weird little red hood fetish costume
@tryguys without a recipe muffins
I agree with a lot of the comments. Although I absolutely love Eugene, I think Ned was robbed today.
“Say something Keith-like.” This dress is gonna be Daddy’s favorite!
Rigged! This was all Ned.
Why is the fact that Kelsey asked for photos while needing to do a project feel like me
Believe me when I say: kpop stans are doing your work Zach. Dudes in dresses are going to be the new thing.
Kelsey is the best Try Guy sub... the chemistry between her and Eugene and Zack is everything!!! More Kels pleeeeezzzz!!!
"My favorite thing about a dress is that you don't have to wear an underwear or bra with it" 3:43  Uhh...is...do people do that?
Solution for Zach: kilts. Wear a kilt!
After reading the comments, I need a Try Guys vs Try Wives challenge.
I really hope Kelsey gets to come back. She's so fun
Petition for them to do this again but with crazy dresses mad from weird things and micarah tewers has to be a judge because she is Queen of sewing amazing dresses cheaply and she made a diaper dress lol.
it's the purple wig for me eugene😭
This is the behind the scenes that I want to see from Drag Race design episodes
Ned was robbed!
Is it just me, or does Ned look like a stereotypical porn star from the 1970s with his mustache.   November is Movember
I hand sew my my own clothes and making an ENTIRE GARMENT like a DRESS in 3 HOURS is impossible with hand lemme tell ye
Kelsey is such a bitch and she's so savage and I LOVE HER
Honestly, Ned deserved to win!! Eugene is the master of these videos, but this time.... I’d put Zach over him 😅
Ned I love ya, and I think you totally should’ve gotten first place. You knocked this competition outta the park!!!
Yes! More sewing content! Feeed meeee nomnomnom
Yessss!! More like this!!! Get back to the TRYGuys ROOOTS!!
Ned's second child: *Is born* Ned: 👨
Where are the masks? And little to no social distancing?
Uggh, i didnt mean to be sweet                                                                       -- Eugene 2020
Eugene sold it more, but Ned should have won. This was a dress making contest, not a modelling contest!
Ned deserved this one
Ned should’ve got first place. It was so creative yet those chose a dress that looked more like a blanket
Did Kelsey get work done on her face? No shade, she looks great, just different than I remember. Or is it just my brain being smooth?
This might be the first time i feel like Eugene should not have won the first place Ned's took a lot more effort And was accurate for what he was going for And don't even get me started with boning I really appreciate Ned For me Ned wins the 1 st place ❤️
noo..ned should be the winner...because...without the hood ...eugene dress is simple...
justice for Ned!
this made me forget the election ... thank u
Lol Keith and Kelsey and SO similar. It's hilarious! :D Also, I absolutely love the 'without instructions' episodes, especially when it's crafting something like clothes
13:10 Zach have you not heard of femboy friday and seen all these maid dress tiktoks smh
The judges that they bring into these shows need to get their shit together and leave their biases at the door. It’s extremely frustrating to see Eugene win 99.9% of the time. Ned was robbed, he too the feedback fro the pants episode and applied it here and it fell on deaf ears and blind eyes. If the judges are going to automatically decide that Eugene wins even if he didn’t try, them just stop makin these contest vids. Jesus.
omg i've been waiting for thisss. why didn't i get a notification wtf 😭💀
1.8 commentssss
Ned should've won hands down!!!!
Damm I want to learn how to saw
Kelsey: What kind of dress would Keith make?    Me: Da...Daddy’s favorite...
But can we see them try again with a sewing pattern cause that would still be hard as hell
Kelsey: “what kind of dress do you think Kieth would have made?”  Me: daddy’s favorite dress 😂😂😂
As a goth/emo, I think I would buy Ned's dress in stores. Eugene's is one I would want to wear and try on but probably too expensive for me
So basically Eugene won, but everyone agrees that Ned SHOULD BE the real winner 😂👌🏻
That Kelsey girl is annoying and abnoxious...eeeekkkk
This was a really fun episode!! The drape of Eugene's dress with the cape hood was SICK I love it
Ned was robbed!! He should have won! Ned thought outside the box to create the dress (the hammering?!). His dress was my fav! Neds confidence showed walking down the runway
My Vote Goes to Ned for this one... Like his outfit was literally the most advanced and do you have any idea how long it took me to make my first corset? it took me 3 DAYS. Eugene's dress was pretty, but i feel like it was way more simple, easy and not as detailed as Ned's dress was. :(
Ned, you have first place in my heart!!! You were robbed!! Too much creativity and effort to be in second place. He made a corset like are you serious!?
Ned you are the winner, Eugene just wins because he is Eugene. Your dress was better
Also I can’t wait to see when they discover stabilizers and bias tape
At this point i know who will be first alwayssss
give Zach a butcher knife and he's the spitting image of Norman Bates in Psycho
i like ned's dress best
13:42 Zack is so freaking adorable! 🤣🥰🥰🥰😊
A March madness style with instructions with the try guys and try wives/husbands
Zak’s dress gives me grandmas couch vibes, ngl-
Loving neds moment! But of course Eugene had to win. They were both great though!
NED WAS ROBBED
*Ned with a moustache makes him look like an Italian dad-*
When Eugene leaves to start his solo career Kelsey is the only replacement I accept.
Neds is so fucking cool, looks like what a punk rock lead singer would wear. Actually very Kurt Cobain in a dress.
Ned should have won
Try guy: let men wear dresses Roman and greek men: you guys can't wear dresses?
Kelsey's impressions of Keith won this episode
"It's hard to find, sort of, non-binary clothing"  *Every enby relates*
Ned please get rid of the stash😂
Man I love zsch so much he is so so so adorable and absolutely nice. He had no ego at all and just keeps trying and having fun. A-do-ra-ble
wow zach's hair looks so good!
Kelsey's impression of Keith is so spot on 😂😂
I’d like to volunteer to be Eugenes personal seamstress. Cuz he needs clothes you can’t find on the rack
Okay so now we need someone to make dresses that are actually real inspired by these designs
Why did they change the tittle?
yall endorsed the wrong person TRY GUYS
KELSEY has so much work done, looks so plastic, :/
Eugene: ethnic people know...they got a nana who wear a house dress  Me: omg my great aunt from Austria does!!! Whenever I’ve gone to Austria to visit family, she wears a house dress!
NED WAS ROBBED! He should have won!
Try Guys AND PARTNERS without instructions
They didn’t introduce Roman!!! ☹️
Ngl, Ned nailed it 100%
i think ned should’ve wonn!
I love Eugene...but judges really need to start actually acknowledging where the guys are starting from and how impressive their creations are BASED ON who they are. Eugene having an upper hand means that he should have worked harder. What Ned pulled off was incredible and definitely deserved the win.
Ned and Eugene's actually looked amazing 😂 Neds construction was crazy good and well, Eugene's is just the definition of beauty.
Zack is been so salty
I swear- how does everything Eugene do turn out perfect?
Zach is wearing  my Nanas pj and or my nanas dress to cook
Keith: has a sauce company Zack: has a tea company Ned: has a parenting podcast Now can we please have Eugene's designer clothing line???
Eugene did that 🤩🤩🤩
Ned deserved first place
I love Kelsey!! Bring her in more videos!!
Kelsey 😂
I think they all look so good and worked them all! 😍❤️
omg I missed Kelsey!! Love her!!
Ned : making an e girl skirt Eugene : working really hard Kelsey & Zach : taking Insagam photos
So since Kelsey was Keith's substitute does this mean the dress is "Mommy's favourite"?
I had the hugest crush on Kelsey when I watched buzzfeed videos
I love how they are 6 feet apart
Ned really is ned flanders incarnate
Who are you voting
Bro the women on the right needs to shave her legs...
Zack looks like Olive Oil from Popeye lol
i hate to be negative but it really bothered me how lauren kept cutting off roman/interrupting him mid sentence, it may totally just be the editing or me overthinking it, but the entire judging section i was just like "omfg let him speak!!"
Eugene: “thank you for believing in my queerness” 😂😂😂
EUGENE!!! Clothes have no gender! If you wanna wear a floral pin-up dress, do it. F*ck the haters. Also honestly I think Ned should've won, it had more details and it was skin tight. Drapey  dress is more forgiving.
Ned has evolved in his fashion confidence! I knew he was gonna take a risk because hellooo his whole fashion journey in the book! Any true try guys fan would have known! *Said like Elle Woods
NED SHOULDVE WON THAT  Eugene’s had a lot of torn edges, it didnt look like what he wanted, it was a mistake that somehow worked out.  NOW im like 98% certain that the judges just pick Eugene for the hell of it
Honestly the only thing that would've made Eugene's dress better would've been if it had pockets!
Do we all agree that ned won?
Can we have a showdown between Ariel and Eugene PLEASE
i’ve been Waiting for a half-hour comedy relief for 24 hours, thx for this!!
Ned was fucking robbed! His dress was sooooo cute!
Kelsey should've brought Jared 😂  Hot guy distracts the Try guys (Basis: Australia episode - the Seafood one, Acupuncture episode)
I can honestly really see Eugene get into sewing and make his own clothes to wear, but I think Ned should have won! He attempted a lot of more advanced details and it was very creative.
We love Eugene but Ned was today’s winner 👏🏽👏🏽I was very impressed... if you put that on someone with curves 👌🏽
Ned's dress was so creative!!
Now they switched it from food to fashion now
Okey, can we talk about how we want Eugene's dress!?  Try guys merch alert! To a new level. Don''t miss out on this opportunity!
I’m really proud of Ned, honestly
Definitely feel like Ned won this one. I love Eugene, but I feel like he relied on his accessories to boost his points a little. If you took those away, like they said, it was sort of very plain, due to no variation in color/pattern/embellishments. It's a good dress but Ned's was 100% finished and planned out and well executed.
Low key Ned was robbed here...his finish was quite a lot better than Eugene’s
we got angst, we got sundresses, we got maxis, we got built-in elegant hoods wow
Ned is looking v julien solomita in this and I love it sm
As soon as the judges said Eugene won, I yelled at my screen, "Wrong!" Ned obviously won.
this is so stressful but it also made my day
Ends outfit reminds me of Easy A XD
ned SERVED that dress omg
I miss Kelsey!!!
she’s annoying 😬
Ned‘s dress woke me up inside, SAAAVED ME, called my name and saved me from the dark.
1. Ariel 2. Eugene 3. Zack 4. Ned  Just my personal opinion
I don't care what anyone says Ned won that
I love this topic pls make this a series
Ned was robbed!!!
Ned looks like Freddie Mercury in this. Just me?
Eugenes back is seriously gorgeous. 😂😂
Kelsey: you don't have to wear a bra with a dress! Anyone with size D+ boobs: ......incorrect
KPOP STANS, EMERGE! WE HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON  Make dresses on men more of thing! GO!💥👄💥
“Dudes in dresses, make it the next hot thing.” You heart the man! Hongjoong in a skirt, Kai in a crop top, WayV members dressed as princesses! Normalize men wearing women’s clothing. Artiny, Artist kpop Stans, we got this, right?
This should have been titled “LauraDIY cutting everyone off mid sentence”
Love hearing my name throughout a try guys video 🥰🤣
Kelsey is a storm. She is something.
Why does Eugene always win? He's GOOD AT EVERYTHING
I NEED Eugene's dress. That was an elegant monochromatic beauty that I would 100% wear
Zack, Kelsey, Ned, and finnaly first is Eugene!
I figured Eugene would come through with something stunning, but Ned honestly shocked me with his look 😍
i thought the girls and the gays had claimed Zach ?  in what world is he the patriarchy
Eugene for Drag Race.
i do love sundresses but sundresses don't like me 😫😫
In regards to Ned's shirt... I voted for biden. AKA the smarter choice
How is eugene just good at everything????
NED WAS ROBBED!!!!!!! I love eugene but NEDS DRESS WAS AMAZING
Kelsey is so annoying when she’s “trying” to be funny.
I love that Zach is wearing Eugene's pajamas.
eugene's "patriarchy!" comments are getting old. it's obvious, we get it! no need to constantly alienate people if you're so invested in the creation of an harmonious society. and if it's spite talking, then that's just awkward and quite unpleasant for the viewers.
Zach really needs to TRY harder 🥴😅 .. how is he always just missing the mark entirely lmao come on Zach!!
Zach taking pics of Kelsey is so freaking cute 😊
Kelsey you look like a fcking Goddess. The fit of it and those legs, damn guuuurl.
I wanna buy Ned’s dress ngl
Kelsey looks so good! Love the jumpsuit❤ Also Eugene's shirt in the interview segments👌
damn i gotta say i liked eugenes the least. i thought everyone else did way better!
Lol, stop trying to make fetch happen! 🤣🤣
just here hoping someone knows where that jumpsuit is from
Eugene served
9:55 You know what Red Green would say - if the women don't find you handsome, at least they'll find you handy. Wait - you're American, you probably don't know who Red Green is. Also, the mustache is pretty smokin'. Never mind. Continue hammering. If that doesn't work, try duct tape.
22:59 ooh ned we saw your balls
No, Ned. the mustache is not a look.
13:09 Me, looking at my strawberry dress Felix sketch  : 👁👄👁
Quilt without instructions  Yes, that would be good
I actually like to see Kelsey wearing Ned and Eugene's dresses at the end. Oh, maybe Korndiddy's too.
YO where does a girl get a corset like the one Roman is wearing??? NEED
Dudes in dresses 2020
eugene was cool but ned blew my mind! it looked very cool and as an ex-scene kid, Yes
ned's mustache is so destracting
this video is saving me right now. I am so stressed today and this is the only thing bringing me joy
Kelsey has the most CHAOTIC energy. I love it.
Ned with a stache is a vibe
eugene sell that ohmygod i want to buy that so so bad i want that dress
Ned should have won. Ned-- your dress is amazing, and I also love Nirvana and the grunge looks even though I usually dress pretty casual or cute. You did amazingly and I hope you will continue to step out of your comfort zone and craft such amazing things! Eugene's was very pretty, but also very deserving of second place (still an honor!). All of you did amazing and I love seeing you make clothes with no patterns! Please keep cooking/baking/crafting!
I'd wear Neds to show the rebellious part of me. I'd wear Keith's replacement to a park I'd wear zacks to show my sweet side. And I'd wear Eugene's to partys and also for fun, also also for a Halloween constume
I would have thrown a riot if Ned won over Eugene.... that dress is so fabulous, so stylish and elegant and wearable. Ned's is easy to hide flaws with that belt taped on (honestly this was the only factor that turned it into a dress, and not a skirt/belt/top combo... and the choice of belt is really tacky).... less is more, and Eugene's was definitely a DRESS... he sewed all, and hemmed up most of his dress (instead of using tape and/or hot glue), I'd say that effort alone makes him the winner.
But like can Kelsey's dress be an actual thing? I would buy it
Watching them sew is so frustrating. Like add an extra inch guys. You need seam allowance
Zach and Kelsey doing the Instagram shoot is adorable and hilarious at the same time.
I really read the title of this as “try guys make dresses without a recipe”
Kelsey is very Chelsea Handler. I love it! 💕🙌🏾😂
"I've only worn a dress like ... 3 times?" King
i feel like ned would THRIVE at new york fashion week
I’m living for the Willie Ninja moment!!! Yasss judge. Cute dresses and I loved Ned’s thighs throughout lol
Ned was robbed of this victory. His dress is way more creative and difficult to make than Eugene's.
I love thisss
I generally hate moustaches, but I love  Ned's moustache . It really suits him.
I like Ned's dress, I really thought he would win.
this is prob the one time that i don’t think eugene should’ve won
I wanna be as confident as kelsey
Thank you, boys. I needed something good today, and y'all came through.
i think they shoul wear their creations for a day .... anyone feeling the same?
Wow this was such a fun Without Instructions episode! I’m on board with guys wearing more dresses and it was so cool to see everyone’s aesthetics come out. I think it would be awesome if the guys took a sewing class for real and then attempted more sewing challenges! It would open them up to way more DIY possibilities for future videos :) but of course it’s funny to watch with their current skill sets as well
Can I just say. The fact that Eugene looks BETTER IN A DRESS THAN ME gives me a goddamn complex?! 😂
I would buy Eugene's dress in a heartbeat & I can't wait for the plushie episode!
Sound of music vacation theme hahahahaha
Ned rocking the 70s porn star look...
13:08 Yes Zach kpop stans are watching and we heard it
as someone who teaches sewing for my job, im shocked they managed to get anywhere even close (to be fair, i teach 8 year olds, but still)
For the first time I really think it should have been Ned. I like both but Ned worked so hard.
wait is eugene non-binary or was he trying to say androgynous???
I’m offended that Ned didn’t win he did so good
When will Eugene come out with his own fashion line?
I was really hoping Ned would win because his just seemed so much more complex, but we all know Roman's biased toward Eugene and probably pushed for him hard lmao
I love Kelsey 😂
I miss Kith 😭
look i love eugene with all my heart but ned should definetly win!!<3
Ned's mustache 🤦🏾‍♀️
At 22:05 no one noticed the person / ghost passing by? 👀
I need eugenes dress please!!!!
Kelsey is that friend who picks on you to show “love” but it’s really just her being rude. You shouldn’t have friends that just push you down more and more
No Keith 😭😭😭😭
god i love roman i love seeing roman being featured
I'm gonna be real... I feel like if Eugene hadn't had the gloves, he would not have won.
You know, I don't think it's humanly possible for Eugene to fuck up.
The lack of toxic masculinity is always so refreshing
I really love Eugene’s dress. XD
I like Ned’s more detail and a lot of work put Into it!!
lmao i died when zach realized he sewed the arm holes shut
Ariel > Eugene Eugene > Everyone else
Kelsey is so beautiful like if you agree
Kelsey is so beautiful like if you agree
Kelsey: Every 👏 bitch 👏 loves 👏 a sundress 👏   Me: *vigorously nods in every bitch* 💅
please don’t do muumuus like that
“Every b*tch loves a sundress” I mean she’s not wrong
Eugene is always so gorgeous! I would have totally wore neds dress though. Def my style.
Why is no one talking about Kelsey’s mean girls reference!? That was GOLD
I mustache you to shave
I liked the Try Guys, and Buzzfeed for that matter, when everyone wasn't such a character. Like, why can't everybody just be normal? I assume Zach is high off his ass all the time. Kelsey? Saying the word bitch doesn't make you edgy. And you don't need to talk at level 1000. No one likes you. And every time Keith is on scene, he's always talking about his dick. I liked the old days when everyone sort of just behaved like humans and not caricatures. Which is probs why Eugene is my fave. He hasn't changed an inch. Personality wise, he's exactly who he's always been.
Horrible. C+ for effort.
NED SHOULD HAVE WON LOL
Ned got robbed of first place!!
Anyone else just Not feeling this whole kelsey thing...
Like is Zach wins! Huh don’t worry about it 😂😂😂
Eugene's dress looked high fashion and elegant but I think Ned's dress was more complicated and had a lot more well done details
It looked like Eugene got lucky that the dress looked good on him, whereas Ned seemed to put in 1000% more effort and planning into his. Ned got robbed.
Honestly. I love Zach's. It's wearable for dudes. It's casual and comfortable.
does zach know tik tok made guys in skirts the hot thing
“It’s DARE-AHH! Not Darr-RA” 😂 I don’t remember which video that was from but that’s what I think about every time I see her now haha
Love that episode. I think Ned should have won.
13:10 believe me we’ve been asking for idols in skirts for years and we just need to keep manifesting
YAAAASSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN EVER SINCE THE PANTS VIDEO!!
When Eugene said Zack looked like our nana I dieddd LITERALLY MY FIRST THOUGH WHEN I SAW HIS DRESS 😭😭 Representation for our nanas ✊❤
"it's gonna rip" ..... Just like your career in fashion  😂😂😂😂 savage
You know, I actually knew it was going to be Eugene in 1st, Ned in 2nd,  Kelsey in 3rd and Zach in 4th. The whole time I just knew it, I don't know how though!
i have never clicked so fast on a video because the first thing i thought about was "oo men in dresses"
why is ned turning into the dad 👨🏼emoji?
Zack looking like a granny lol
Did Eugene just make his character of D&D night? Damn
i loved how supportive eugene was being of everyone when they were making their dresses 🥺🥺 made me smile everytime he was like “you got this kelsey!”
Anyone else just wanting to start sewing?
LOL @ Eugene accidentally saying something sweet about his mom 🥺😂😆💜
I liked ned dress better tho 👉👈
I think Ned should have won. He put in way more effort in my opinion.
Kelsey had some blue squares, so I feel like she was really channeling Keith.
I love dressmaking. I have never clicked so fast. 😂
i would've liked it if they explained why eugene's dress won over ned's if it was so close for them.
Neds BACK in that dress, congrats 💪
Hi Kelsey!!
Zach is my favorite
Ned def should have won  You can tell how proud he is in it which is the purpose of a good outfit
Bro we're way ahead of you zach
Ned: a Yale graduate struggling with simple multiplication and addition
ned was robbed
Im sorry ned should have won. His was the hardess to make and very creative
KELSEY, the nugget of hope I needed this morning lmao
Eugene always serves us looks
wait eugene’s dress is something i’d see on a runway and be like “yea that so cool” it looks RICH
Just got into playing with old clothes making other clothes out of them and I love how these videos are just in time to help me too thank you 😁😊
@ 17:20  Omg poor ned!! 😭😂
I think ned won this one, I didnt not expect thiis!!
Zach's dress reminds me of Wednesday Adams but she went on vacation in Hawaii
Someone make a compilation video with all of Eugene's wins. I know it will be a long ass video but I need it
I thought Ned would win 🥺 Sorry Eugene but Ned's got my vote here
Such good timing!! I just bought a new sewing machine and am feeling so intimidated by it, but I wanna sew cosplay costumes so bad!!!! 😩😬 lol
Awesome video!!!!!!
This  remember me about that every time I were dresses in school I get bullied because I’m trans (ftm)
Liking for emo ned exclusively
why is eugene never in many videos anymore ? i’m sure there’s a valid reason and he’s probably just busy but please guys we miss him and we want to know
Ned lowkey looked like a scary Freddie Mercury in his dress. This is meant in the most loving way but I really don't like the mustache
Omg Zach made a pillowcase.
We need more of this. We love this
Ned should have won! He should have won extra credits for his cool staches as well!!
Caught off guard every time Zach referred to his dress by my name lol 😂 Yours truly, Mimi
Kelsey 5th try guy pleeeeeeaaaaaase
I totally get why it was such a close call between Ned and Eugene, but I think I would've put Ned in first place. Eugene's looked amazing on him, and I adore that color. I also like the versatility of the hood/cape. But Ned's was more ambitious and had more creative, intricate touches.
Yeah  class distraction heheh
Did anybody else read Ned's description (he was a skater Boi) in the tune of Avril Lavigne's song?
Ned + mustache, I just keep seeing Nigel Thornberry 😅
Eugene's look is very Nightmare-Mother-In-Law who thinks that because she suffered, every other woman who comes close to her precious son has to suffer too...
Their effort is certainly to be commended, but as someone who sews, this series has certainly been fascinating to watch! 😂
Why does Eugene remind me so much like Rosa from Brooklyn 99
Already watched this on FB, Ned needed more fuss he did awesome!
I’m inclined to think if ned had an hourglass figure he would have won... tell me I’m wrong though?
Lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooo pls bring Kelsey back
Ned's goal aesthetic was to basically be Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way
Kelsy dress looked nice but the construction was pretty bad (not saying that I’m better than her but according to professionals it was not the greatest) but I love her creativity (A+) for that. Ned dress was also nice but it had much better construction compared to her. Zack what can I say it reminded me of grandma house wear that was done well and the purple dress was amazing very fashionable and nice and very modern it looks like Dior dress
I would give Ned the first place. His dress was amazing and very detailed ❤️👗😍
I have ideas for them: Try guys try color guard Try guys try band(all have different instruments) Try guys try 2020 styles Try guys try tap dance Try guys try pregnancy simulator These ideas are so stupid lmaoo
My abuela definitely owns something like Zach's dress
I feel like Eugene will win every competitions lol 👀  Eugene’s dress is mind blowing and beautiful 😍
I needed this today
I would so buy Eugene's dress, but I feel like Ned was robbed. He went so out of his comfort zone and gave 110%. Kudos, Ned. Edit: Due to the news about Ned cheating on his precious wife, I take back my comment. Ned gets NOTHING! HE LOSES! GOOD DAY, SIR! Eugene wins! 🏆
Ned and Eugene - project runway zach and kelsey - sewing for dummies
Eugene is the son everyone wants as a female, my words he is so loving and respectful to his mother. Edit: God Eugene looked GOOD in his dress.
As someone who’s taken fashion history, Ned’s grunge look is actually how grunge clothes were made! Experimenting, drawing things on, glueing, cutting. Eugene’s creations are always gorgeous but Ned actually nailed his theme 👌🏼
I didn’t even notice she was that Kelsey lol
This is giving me extreme dragrace vibes
Okay I just love Kelsey's jumpsuit though, it's so cute and looks so comfy
Heck yeah I love Ned’s dress!
Tik tok: uh is ‘dudes in maid dresses’ ok?
not all the way through yet but wow Ned is looking amazing he honestly should add smth like that to his closet and just wear it!
God Kelsey is so unfunny
Is Eugene wearing @norblacknorwhite ???? Cuz werk!!!!!!
I just love how ex buzzfeed co workers are friends.
eugene, if i ever have a red carpet to attend (which would be the biggest dream) i would pick you as my stylist  like WHAT THE DRESS it was ✨IMMACULATE✨
Ned was robbed!
(If my memory is correct) this officially marks Kelsey's 4th appearance in these videos!
The they guys destroying toxic masculinity one video at a time :)
Man, when did Keith get hot?
The dress Zach made gives me Golden Girls vibes, I feel like it’s something either Blanche or Dorothy would wear.
Micarah Tewers would had been amazing for this!
Ned was robbed. His looked the most finished and not the mention... THE CONFIDENCE!! 😍
Eugene's silk button-down multicolored shirt is all that matters on this upload in my opinion. I need that shirt!
I love that Ned is doing “I love you” in ASL instead of rock on/horns
Zach made a pillowcase 🙃
New is just dying inside when he gets second
My ass is fucking DYING over here, oh my god, is this how people who can bake felt watching Without a Recipe?? Because HOLY SHIT this hurts me to watch???
“my favorite dress to wear is something you can sleep in, party in, and easily pee in” ...so summer dress. yes.
Tell me y does zack pull "yea girl" better than me!!?
The @ link for Roman pulls up a random YouTube channel that isn't his
is eugene nonbinary
Ned shoulda won haha
People are commenting on how Ned should have won but in my opinion Eugene's dress was better. The construction was complex and sophisticated where you can create multiple looks from that one piece. He used one solid color for the fabric yet he made it interesting. Dresses don't need to have fun colored fabric to be exciting. It looks like something you would find on the runway.  Edit: but I do agree Ned did much better this time than the pants episode. I'm happy to see he is making an effort to go outside of his comfort zone.
Kelsey really looks like kang nara 😱
Ned... or should it be Flanders?
What happened to kelsey’s face? Did she get her lips done?
Totally thought Zach should have gotten 1st... It was super cute and different!
Can confirm: every bitch loves a sundress... Literally the best form of dress ever!
Wait can Zach take my Instagram photos he gave such good advice
I adore how Kelsey adds to this dynamic!!
I love eugene but ned should have hands down won. That dress from a sewing perspective is really hard and the creativity is off the charts.
I hate that the top comment is oh eugene won..... Thanks
Can Roman and Eugene design a gender neutral fashion line? Because I would throw my money at that NOW.
Ned was better!
I so badly wanted ned to win this one
The house dress is so on point... My former (thank God!) Indian mother in law would wear something veeeery similar at home in Singapore... bare feet obviously, with her hair dye still on and bleeding into her scalp a bit, cooking like a mad woman, while having a fight with someone and telling me I was not cutting the cucumbers properly.
I love Kelsey!!!!!
I would've chosen Ned as the winner just for the corset style, like boning??? Lace-up???? Bro that shit is HARD
LIES!!! Ned won!!!
Please. Anyone but Kelsy 😭
Mari: I'm all here for spooky cottagecore  My gay senses: tingling
Kelsey was really good looking in this one.
Thank you for posting this video. I saw that you all wanted to post a fun video to help people relax a little and it did the trick.
Well... Kelsey is my new favorite Try Guy.
controversial but Ned deserved that first place
Could you guys do a neutral dress for everyone with try guys merchandise I'd get that
Why is the blonde girl so annoying. She is like if Amy shumor was thin and stupid
Zach: “Dudes in dresses: make it the next hot thing!” Weebs: We’ve had dudes in skirts, in cat ears and in maid outfits. I think we can do this.
nooo, ned wanted to win so bad... he deserved it :(
eugene should make a nonbinary clothing line
Kelsey’s dress: Patched-together-picnic Zach’s dress: Sassy Grandma Ned’s dress: Goth Cloth Tube Eugene’s dress: 70s Jazz (or sexy cult)
I fell in love with Kelsey today 🥺💖
Zach: Guys in dresses make it happen  Genz : Dont worry we already started... with maid dresses .
Why we bullying zach in the comments?
literally love kelsey's idea of a perfect dress. party, sleep, and pee. the essentials lol
OMG KELSY
Maybe as a finale to this series, the try guys can try to make an entire costume for a holiday or something?  I’m really looking forward to see the future videos of them trying to see clothes ❤️
ned with clean shaved face: nice boy ned with beard: hey daddyyy ned with mustache: oh no please not
I really think the mustache makes Ned look like Steven McRae from the Royal Ballet.
ned was robed
Ned 👏 was 👏 robbed
The way Ned stares into distance while scratching his neck at 10:21 :)))) I can't
I really love Eugenes dress, but for me, Ned should’ve won
SPOILER . . . . Ned absolutely should have won his was amazing and the BONING. the chains??? the tulle!!! and he was so in love with it too :C
I think Neds mustache has super powers.
Keith: Dad's Cookie Eugene: Mom's Dress Me: Me likey !
Zach's entry in his 'MIMI'..priceless. Don't get me started on that ground-crawl move on the runway lol
I just clicked this video and already knew Eugene is gonna kill it anyway
Ned was robbed!
I'm so happy to see Kelsey and Roman here♡ I love them
Please attempt blazers or paper mache sculptures
Can Kelsey be in more videos 💖🥺 and then have Freddie 💖😭✨🥺🥺!
Good to see Kelsey after so long. She was my fav at BuzzFeed ❣️
I'm sorry ned but that mustache...
Without instructions is my favorite series
I honestly think Ned should've won!
Ned was robbed
Can I have eugine dress
Yessss I’ve been waiting for this one turn it up
ahhhhh im earlyy
Ned was robbed. Come on!
Eugenes was nice, but Ned FOR SURE should’ve won this!
any one else thinks ned should shave not to hate or anything i just dont like it
We need more vids with kelsey. She should be a permanent character in the channel.
Omg do this with Michaela Tewers!
Ned was robbed
how did ned, a heterosexual male born in FLORIDA, eat this competition UPPPP i LOVE it
Omg did Zach just quote the Iron Giant 😳😳😳
“Thank you for believing in my queerness.”   *I love that.*
NED SHOULD HAVE WON
Ned was totally robbed...
Why does Zach look like the teacher from the magic school bus
Theory: Keith purposefully skipped this episode because his dad doesn’t wear dresses and he didn’t know how to make a “daddy’s favourite dress”
I wish they would've had Micarah Tewers as a judge ohmygod that would've been so entertaining
Okay I *love* Ned’s mustache
My favorite out of the dresses were  ned and Eugene
Keith watching the video: 👁👄👁
"Awww yea. I'm using the crack on the floor as my guide... That's what I said the first time I smoked meth" had me dying.
Honestly they're all so good. I even like zachs ngl!!!
Ned forgot to take his Mr. Beast cosplay off :3.
Eugene’s dress gives me Kylie Minogue Can’t Get You Out of My Head vibes with that hood moment.
wooooow ned and eugene ! mindblowing :0 <3<3<3<3
Legends say Kelsey still hasn't gotten out of that dress
you manage to make me smile and laugh with every single one of your videos. thank you so much🖤!! i don't have a lot to smile about these last weeks
Dress for dude: isnt that jubah?
NED WAS ROBBED
Am I the only me who thought the girl was trying to hard to be funny cute and quirky?
In my opinion Ned was robbed of the win in this one. I would rank it . . . 4. Zach 3. Eugene 2. Kelsey 1. Ned But who am I to say, when I can't even touch half the fabrics out there
Omg I have a bigger butt than Ned I’m a 43 butt!
I think it was wise not to have keith in this episode because keith saying Daddy's Favorite while making a dress is just not but creepy 😂
Ned really looks like a sherif now.
OK BUT NEDS DRESS THO
Why am I so attracted to Ned while he's wearing his dress? I need a moment.
yess i missed kelsey with the try guys💗
Ned's dress looks kind of like something Wonder Woman would where 😂
ned’s posture when wearing his dress is proof that a great outfit makes anyone feel confident
OMG I LOOOOVE NEDS DRESS. I would wear that every day. Omfg, and his booty looks great in it
I mean we all knew it was eugene even before they showed the dresses.
*Eugene vs Ariel*
"Like, if Zach wins,  the patriarchy wins" Zach: "Don't worry about it!"
I am so distracted by Ned's stache
...ned should have won
ned looks so cool this vid w the bandana mustache combo
I’m early I have never been early I can’t believe it also if you want to tell me your favorite try guy just cause
zach needs to learn abt boys in skirt on skateboards
Yooo Ned looks like an actual designer
Yay Kelsey!
Ned won. The boning?? Corset?? Sheer overlayer? Details at the front?? Cmon its no competition. Also the fact that it fit him perfectly. Eugenes dress was ok like it looked like a fabric drapped over something and left like that also it was monochrome which hid mistakes and that back was pretty bad. idek what else to say lol btw zacks creation is your retired grandma living her best life gardening in miami
Zach taking pictures and directing Kelsey is giving me life!!
Eugene’s design is probably the best, but I love how Ned really embraced his inner Avril Levine.
Next will be kids outfit with Wes modeling them, isn’t it?!
I'm sorry but I really can't get used to Ned's moustache
I should not find Eugene's back as hot as I do
YES NED! Coming out with my emo myspace dreams! Honestly, that was a winning look for me.
Ned you're the winner I don't care what they said
I love this series
Aw I thought Ned would win this time!!
I really want to join the competition and show them all up.
As an amateur sower:   If you want to make a dress without an instruction you should use stretchy fabric.
If the try guys want to keep up the occuring theme of featuring former buzzfeed employees then they should definitely feature Eric Tabach
Personally I think Ned should have been #1
"Uh, I didn't mean it to be sweet!"   Lol!!
Zach: this is so fetch  Me: Zach stop trying to make fetch happen  Kelsey: Zack stop trying to make fetch happen Me:.....  Me: AHHHHH!!
Eugene: *making a dress for his mom Me: So what you're saying is you're making a Mommy's Favorite
Ned is the winner in my book!!
22:04 is it only me or a ghost walked by the window in daytime 🤔🤔🤔🤔
LOL actually love the stash Ned! (Must be Ariels idea? ^^ <3 )
Kelsey is a queen and I love that you guys are friends irl
Eugene's ambitious as always 😀😀
“if zach wins the patriarchy wins”                                               - eugene 2020
I love Eugene and he did a great job but Bed definitely should have been first place
12:26 as a dude who’s never had a tanline, do all girls have that strong of a tanline because of bras? Cause that’d be honestly miserable
I feel like Ned should have won. Everyone's was great, but Ned's was by far the most impressive.  Its the only one that looks like' it could be bought somewhere. The others all look kinda unfinished. But creative though. Also Zach did really good this time compared to his usual .. end products ;)
This was good.i like this
The comment section previously: "Try Guys try making circle skirts without instructions!!" Try Guys: try sewing a dress without instructions Me: noice 😏😎
At 31:08 Eugene’s dress reminds me of when Zach was in the vulva costume, ya know the one: “Ooohh!!! I’m the clitoris?!?” one lmao
I love the moustache
What unit of measurement are they using to measure their butts? Cause 40" is huge and 40cm is tiny. Lol I think they used the tape backwards 🤔
Love you guys!!
The fact zach forgot arm holes. Its hysterical. For Zach ? He done good.
How does Eugene do this all the time .....he is amazing 😘❤️
10:50 "did u just have a stroke?" Crack me up 🤣
Zach wearing the most hideous dress ever made 🤣🤣🤣
Love  Eugene's Dress and how he owns the cat walk 👏👏🤩😘
kelsey and zach are so funny omg
I feel like Eugene is going to win...let me watch and see.
I’m white, but a house dress is also a southern thing. My nana looooves them
3:46 wtf?
Kelsey's Keith was 😗👌
Eugenes was pretty but I feel like Ned was robbed
"If Zack wins???" "Don't worry about it." lmao me too
24:22 Eugene looks like a proud dad. Lol
i fuckin love kelsey
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Ned deserved to win!
kelsey is such a good embodiment of female keith
This video is just cosplayers two days before a con
I want Eugene’s dress. I agree that this is the way to bring hoods and capes back into fashion and I’m loving it 💜
I needed this video today. My brain is shot from all this election nonsense.
Favorite Try Guys video to date!!!
I love the dual Zach and Kelsey Leo energy
i love ned's amount of detail in his dress, he did great!
Eugene's dress look more glam out of the rest. So it was obvious ✌
Eugene is so nice on this episode
Ned fvcking KILLED this. Iconic.
Please tell me you guys are doing without a recipe these holiday season !!
as someone who recently got into sewing, this hurts me. thank you.
Woah am I an hour early-
Zach is serving Filipino grandma from the province realness, and I would know. My grandma and her friends dress that way. 😂
ned should have won
Eugene's shirt at the beginning is everything 😂👌
Nice job. Funny.
I'm gay, and yet, I'm in love with Kelsey
my fellow filipinos will agree that zach's dress is definitely a duster :-)  edit: ok eugene kind of mentioned it somehow LMAO
Keith is the one with all the LEGS!! I wanted him to make a dress too 😭
Ned made bones! And basically tuned his own fabric! Why didn't he win??
Ok but like Kelsey is basically just Katherine Ryan
Before Eugene came out, Kelly always hit on him omg
Zach looks like a Russian grandma😅
High key upset that Ned didn't win this challenge
Could I get a pattern for Eugene’s dress? He absolutely nailed it.
“Ethnic people know they got a nana” dude, ALL of us have that nana - at least in my country - every Scottish woman over the age of 70 owns that dress and the thick, beige, varicose veins compression tights to go with it!
Here's another one reasons I feel Eugene won: it's creative to use other fabrics and textures, and can be very difficult to incorporate them effectively. However, it's so difficult to bring flare to a single type of fabric and be able to diversify it's appearance solely based on placement and style alone. Eugene used only one kind of fabric, layered it, multi-purposed its cuttings, and ended up creating a full look out of one massive sheet of fabric. Everyone did so well though, especially as beginners! I'm a beginner myself and I can't even sew on a machine, I have to do it by eye and hand!  Awesome job guys! Can't wait to see what without instructions comes next!
why would they pick these designs for a FIRST dress WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS
I seriously hope dresses like Eugene make become a thing now. I would wear that everywhere, and I also feel like it'd be a great new design for Little Red Riding Hood costumes specifically
Ned,  you're the best kind of person, I think you are the best Try Guy, but the mustache is horrible and it has to go
Wow kelsey looked deep into botox
I need someone like Zach to take my Instagram photos 😂
I really like Kelsey
Eugene is killing that ~*justin timberlake half time show*~ top
Very entertaining video! Keep them coming!
I kind of dig the mustache to be honest!
6:57 They be acting like 13 year old's, ngl. Wait they do that all the time, lol.
🎉GREAT JOB GUYS🎉
No wayyyyy Eugene looks fabulous. no idea how to sew a dress but the creativity and style is there!
Kelsey fits in so well, it's amazing :D
WOW
The mustache has made Ned   FULL THROTTLE FULMER
I gotta say when I think of the patriarchy,  zach isn't the first thing that comes to mind.
NEd loOks So ItALiEn iN tHiSs
As soon as the double-sided tape came out, this video turned into a full-blown episode of RuPaul's Drag Race haha. People sitting on floors shouting their dresses won't be finished and other meltdowns. Absolutely loved it.
Ned was robbed, his was best by far!
damn i want the pattern of eugenes dress..its so pretty TT props to ned for the corset attempt..that shit is hard!
the nana thing eugene said was for real the first thing i thought when i saw zach's dress
I want to buy Eugene’s dress like right now please can I have it
We need a “Eugene Always Wins” shirt 👔😂 Cause he always wins!!! Lol!!!
Ned 100% should have won this! More effort, more thought, more creativity, and it was executed pretty well! This should have been Ned's win!
All of these dresses are so good though???
I'm actually so impressed with how the dresses turned out :)
I loved both Ned and Eugenes dresses. I can see both of their dresses in stores. Eugenes could be seen in a high end store and sold easily. Neds could be sold at hottopic EASILY! It really should have been a tie.
ned was robbed imo. sorry eugene, love you, but neds had more flavor
Who wants to see a showdown between Ariel and Eugene? They are both the best at somehow making everything perfect
How is no one talking about Kelsey’s crack joke? 💀
I just noticed that Kelsey did blue squares for the majority of the dress. She really is channeling Keith energy
Zach looks like a grandma, he nailed that look
Uh... am I the only one that thinks Eugene’ just looks like Zach’s with a hood? Ned should have won, no question. His had the clearest vision, the best fit, the most construction elements, and the cleanest finish. I love Eugene, but his was gapping where it wasn’t meant to, the zipper was sloppily installed, it had no shape, and the hood wasn’t impressive to me. I’m just confused.
Anyone else got excited when Eugene said "Mari ..." and was hoping for Mari Takahashi?
i love and really appreciates ned effort. for me he should win cuz this episode abt sewing a dress. as construction wise, the corset tho, ned is amazing for someone who didnt sew. but fashion is different, we couldnt even understand. the weirder the better 🤣
That’s Zack’s eating dress
Kelsey doing what all dragqueens but bianca del rio does
Eugene say the word non-binary   Me: explodes with happiness 💛♡💜🖤
I really thought Ned was gonna win this one
Her back looks incredible
I want to be Eugene but, in reality, I am Zach.
Do think Neds should have won. I would personally prefur to actually own Eugene's dress, but I think a lot more went into making Neds. There was just way more going on there
Yesterday I got my first sewing machine and started doing random stitches on a piece of fabric and you have to practice a lot to get the tension right so I'm impressed at how they went straight to the fabric and assembly!
I have never needed a video more in my life. PLEASE distract me from this election
Ok....but I completely disagree....I think Ned should have won 😭😭
if the winners aren't eugene,ned, Kelsey then zach, I'm going to be pissed. sorry zach, but you know that's fair.
Ok while I do love Eugenes dress, Ned was robbed! I’ve been sewing for years and I wouldn’t be able to figure out a corset in such a short amount of time. That was fantastic!
Ned was robbed
Eugene is right! I am Italian and my nana had a house dress IDENTICAL to Zach's ahahahah
I looove eugene but this should’ve been ned’s to win.
"it's kind of hard to find non-binary clothing" Did Eugene just-
Sometimes less is more. I could see myself buying a dress that Eugene made
Kelsey I just want to shout out how you’ve maintained the muscle and tone from body makeover. You are looking killer 🗣
Tell me why the Canadian military was the advertisement for this video
Ned not winning is a blatant assault on everyone's emo phase
I watch Micarah Tewers and for that reason only, I feel like I'd absolutely all crush of them.
22:44 Damn Ned’s shoulders 👏🏼 The progress and definition is paying off 👏🏼
I love the cinematography on this video. Everyone looks good!
Ned should have gotten 1st place in my opinion, he did so incredibly well and it was such a statement!!
Not watched it yet but Yeeesssssss!!!! Love this series
We all knew Eugene would win, he really nails it with these episodes HOWEVER!!!! I personally think Ned really out did himself and deserved the win. All the little details he managed to do, the confidence and just ugh all of it. Way to go Ned!
6:50 That's the longest it's ever taken Ned to do math 🤣
Am the only one who likes the mustache?
if those dresses don't have pockecs... im disliking the whole video
I love Kelsey so much!!
kelsy reminds me of jennifer laurence
I'd wear Ned's dress, like DAMN.
am i the only one who thought that they should have invited bestdressed? 🥺🤍
Also I would love Gaby and Allison (Buzzfeed) to come on Try guys.
FOR REAL-- Ned's F*** print needs to be made into a fabric. PLEASE!
What's with Ned's mustache am I the only one who like is very weirded out by it
Ned's dress is absolutely my number 1 - just wow! ^_^
in my opinion, Ned won the competition!
Zach looks like little orphan Annie in spring time
13:11 i have been trying for years, the people wont invest
I want Ned’s dress..... never worn one, but I would for Ned’s dress
YES THEY'RE DOING THISSSSS  I love the corset Roman's wearing.
i think ppl were most mesmerized by eugenes beauty so they didn’t focus the actual quality and structure of his dress.. i didn’t think it was THaT good
My grandmother would've loved Zach's dress, I love the fabric.
When zack came out I immediately thought of Olive Oyl? 😂
damnnnnnnnnb ned and eugene DIDDD THAT
Dior look became Azzedine Alaia Grace Johnes look
I'm sorry but that "stop trying to make fetch happen" comment on the heels of Zach saying that those horrible fabrics were fetching was so perfectly timed. 😂✌️
Eugene, that's no dress... it is EVERYTHING!
That “fetch” moment was perfect. The timing. The camera work. The editing. The humour. *chefs kiss*
No Ned, what is it with this beard :D
Gotta say I feel Ned’s was better. He did WAY more on the outfit. Eugene’s was amazing, but I think it was easier as he only did a zipper and then added more fabric for a hood. I loved them all! Great job gang!
For me, Ned's was my favorite. I wish he got a belt that was more cool-toned to match with the rest. It was technically incredibly impressive! I just also loved that he went grungey and did something outside of what I thought he would've done. Keep pushing yourself creatively, Ned! You really shone in this episode!    I think Zach's idea for a mumu could've worked well and I love how confident he was in his end result even if not everyone loved it and it wasn't his original intent. I'm personally down with him looking like he's going to throw a chappal at my head. He might've been better off going for a mumu with that type of pattern and a fabric type that had more movement to it.   Eugene really sold the hood... construction wise, there were definitely things that got covered up because it was a darker monochrome fabric, but I think with better construction, it's definitely the dress I'm most likely to buy.   I love that Kelsey was here and loved her fabric choice... but yeah, pocket teases are cruel, so gotta agree with that placement. The mask was a cute touch.
09:18 I wish my friends take photo of me just like Zach...They just hold the phone and say "1,2,3" and then done, bruh every time my friend take a picture of me, i look like a tired racoon.
Ned looks like he should be starring in a show that takes place in 80s San Francisco (Maybe Tales of the City or something similar) (I'm referring to his look while sewing)
Ned should have won. Another unfair win for Eugene 🤣🤣🤣
Omg! I love Kelsey's one piece sweatsuit/pantsuit (pink)! I need one!!!!!
Zach's dress was so cute though!! It may have had some construction issues but the fabric was cool and it looked so comfy I would totally wear that. Oh and Ned was robbed. His dress was amazing!
I never thought I'd choose Ned over Eugene for a without a recipe/without instructions but Ned's dress F*CKED HARD... Eugene's was good and creative but did not have half of the f*ckery shown in Ned's...
god i love this ned this was dope
they worked up Eugene alot thats not fair :'[
It's really nice to see that they learned quite a bit since the last sewing video ! (I was so nervous while watching because they didn't think of the space the seams would need and even substracted heavily from their measurements "to make it tighter")
Ned, I’m like, genuinely so happy and proud of you. Fashion has been this big fear and you knocked this outta the park and shot for the stars. I’m so impressed.
5:55 "Thank you for believing in my Queerness"
I can't tell you how much I needed this today. What an epic moment for Eugene 😁
Sorry Eugene, but Ned won this one for sure!!
Try Guys Make Dresses Without a Recipe
I said this before. But ned with moustache is HOT!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love to see Kalsey, it has been to long since they did a video together. Kalsey u r a amazing 🙌🙌
ned looks like hed hook up with freddie mercury
I think Kelsey is a perfect sub for Keith in this. She complements the guys in some manner which I love ❤️  Ned- Florida peeps Zach- Leo pride  Eugene- proud LGBTQ+
The mustache is still not normal, sorry ned...
Eugene is just micarah tewersing it
Zach: Kpop stans you got the power to make anything happen. Dudes in dresses. ME: It has happened. Btob,Bts,Nct,Ateez shall I go on?
ned adding gave so much "I WENT TO YALE" energy
Kelsey looks so different..what did she do?
This is my dress ranking: 4th - Zach (I mean ... ) 3rd - Eugene (It was too monochrome so it hid a lot of the bad things. Plus it didn’t fit right at the chest which is a pet peeve of mine) 2nd - Kelsey (if this was better construction wise it would be first. I want this dress but in a form I can take on and off ... 😂) 1st - Ned (Ned was robbed. I mean a corset with boning, come on! He should have won)
Kelsey just looks drunk all the time lol
I wish Ned had have won...
Is it just me or Ned looks a tiny bit like Benedict Cumberbatch here lol
Ned is giving me Freddie Mercury Vibes
WHEN NED WALKED IN WHEWWW HE DID THAT !!!!!!!!!
So excited to see Kelsey!
Ned's giving off a Armie Hammer vibe with the mustasch
14 year old me wants Ned's dress so badly     He was ROBBED!!
Okay but Zach’s dress is what my grandmother wore all the time around the house. It’s always big on her and the patterns are too tropical for our minimal house, but she always rocked it 😂 I thank Zach for bringing back fond memories of her.
POV: you’re watching this video to try and distract yourself from the hot mess of an election taking place
I thought that we’d get to see the girl in Eugene’s dress at the end.
I want a hooded dress nowww
What's the point when Eugene always wins and Zach always loses :D
I love neds dress but without the gold glitter that’s kinda unnecessary lol
I honestly thought this was gonna go terrible but all of them did pretty good and I am pleasantly surprised
EUGENE ATE UP
Eugene’s Texas accent came out SO hard when he said, “This is the first time I’ve seen this.”
I missed seeing Roman on the channel! I was watching old Try Guys fashion videos and was wondering how Roman was doing
KELSEY!!! I need your jumpsuit in my life! Where did you get it?!?!😯😯😯😭
Yeah I’d wear Eugene’s
Try Guys make furniture without instructions (actually sponsored by Ashley's Furniture this time)
"I pay attention! I'm just...too lazy to put it into action." Brutally relateable.
I COULD BUY EUGENE'S DRESS ONLINE LIKE ITS SO GOOD I WOULD BUY IT
Alternate title  the guys do a video where they pretend to make dresses to look at a girls ass
Ned's dress was the best.and its not a close second ...
my favourite probably has to be Kelsey's or Zach's tbh i guess id just wear them both!
Ned should have won
I am loving these sewing challenges. As someone that sews, they are honestly doing a fantastic job. Ned's was SO good .
I love Roman so much! Tape is fine and glue is shit?!Yes.
Making dresses with Ginger Freddie Mercury
neds dress looks likr my Hawaiian grandma pn sunday
Omg I LOVE KELSEY 😂😂😂💕💕💕
I thought Ned was making Violet Chachki's 2 in 1 look 🤣
Eugene looks good in everything, we already knew it was gonna look good in him 😂
Neds dress was amazing 0.0
I need a moment he said💀💀💀💀
8:18 "Nobody knows what you're listening to in your earbuds" I realized that in about 7th grade and it was one of the biggest revelations in my life ngl xD
on behalf of kpop stans: we're on that already zach ;) men in dresses its happening
I want the purple dress!!
Oh yeah. My back is always in pain after sewing or designing but I still love it!
Zack and Kelsey taking instagrams was the sweetest thing I’ve seen all day
oh wow eugene won who would have thought
Ned with the mustache reminds me of Toby from the office. ‘’Smile if you love men’s prostates’’.
I love how Ned is always in the back concentrating in his undies
Am I the only wants to see what Zach could do if he actually tried?
Do you think Zach is ever going to stop complaining ?
I honestly love the Nedstache.
I haven't watched the video, but ofc Eugene won
Ned should have won. Also, Kelsey's Keith impersonation is spot on!
YOU JUST HAD TO RELEASE THIS WHILE I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY HISTORY PROJECT ON THE DISASTROUS 1904 OLYMPIC MARATHON AND NOW I HAVE TO STOP AND WATCH IT JEEZ GUYS but I love you 💕
Listen I love Eugene but Ned BODIED THIS
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Ned found out he and Kelsey had the same butt size he looked so disapointed
Any jojo's bizarre adventure fans getting Mariah vibes from Eugene at the reveal 😳💕
For the first time I really wanted Ned to get first place instead of Eugene 😂 I loved his dress so much and it was so original
"That's what I said the first time I smoked Meth" 😳
We need more Eugene and Kelsey!
Zack: “Can we make boys in dressed the next big thing?”  ,,,who’s gonna tell him
NEDS DRESS IS ACTUALLY SO COOL
Ned really look like rami malek with that mustache on or I watch too much of bohemian rhapsody
Why am I not surprised Ned listens to NPR...
I think I liked Ned’s the best
Eugene has never looked more korean with that red plaid shirt...
ned's and Eugene's dresses are amazing
You know it's gonna be a good video when someone says "and the last requirement we're being judged on, is it a ____"
"do something Keith like" *instantly dies*
Did Eugene do "Mommy's Favourite"?
Always bet on gay
ned dress 😍🤤❤💫
Eugene won but Ned's dress was pretty damn impressive. Those details!
I wonder how you guys would do if you actually had instructions
ohh man, dudes in maid dresses 🥺🥺
ned was robbed
C'mon, the winner is clearly Ned. Eugene's construction is so poor and it looks like every first-year design student's work.
Ned, I'm vibing with the stache. Keep it.
Ned really won this one. His was creative, personal and technical. Frankly I think Eugene only won because it's 'the thing'. Still love you Eugene, but come on.
They should try to make a romper next time
Kelsey is amazing, I just can’t with how pretty she AND her personality are!
Try guys tried to farm weed
Zach looking like a Hawaiian Grandma
Yay Kelsey!!!!
Cool
The end was an incredibly convincing Keith impression haha
Kelsey should be a regular
I love Eugene but ned was rob 🤨
Listen this was tough lol. Eugene and Ned both did great. Eugene’s look was like “couture” what you would see on the runaway, kinda weird but it works??? Lol and then Ned gave me nostalgic vibes cause that’s something I def would’ve worn in high school.
Was kinda lookin forward to keith sowing raisins in his dress but kelsey will do
This is one of the best things Ned has done. He rocked this and he was super confident and out of the box. Love!
Ned you did such a fantastic dress! I loved how you channeled your energy into it, out of the four dresses it was the most visually appealing to me! Keep it up with the sewing!
*"FROM MOTHER OF THE BRIDE TO BADASS MOTHERFUCKER"* My new mantra for the rest of my life
Lowkey... I wanted Ned to win 🙄
I dont like her she was annoying more than Zack. Bring back keith
"thank you for believing in my queerness"   put that shit on my tombstone
I need to see Kelsey on more try guys challenges.... she's hilarious
So the 70s porn star mustache isn't for Halloween?
these things are not fun bc eugene is obviously always going to win 🙄🙄
You guys should do a Try Guys try photography. 😎
Can Kelsey be the 5th try guys! 🤩
Neds mustach really gave him powers
Okay, Kelsey is accepted.  I love her. We need more.
tbh only here to see eugene ace-ing
Ned should’ve won, or if it was really that close they could’ve called it a tie??? But it’s still Ned for me. His dress was more polished and detailed. Eugene’s was bold and ambitious but it didn’t look done.
Ned looks amazing
Kelseyyyyy💕
ngl kinda wished Ned had won this instead :/// also hoping Ned would somehow venture into fashion designing! like who would've thought he'd create THAT
Never thought I would say this but Eugene shouldn't have won Ned was pouring out confidence and serving that look
Dresses are definitely easier than pants.   Also I take full credit for this sewing part of the series! I wrote a comment suggesting this and mentioned costume design and how pants are super difficult and how dresses are great and easier. I have no idea if they saw it but in my head I made this happen l! I am so proud of them (and myself a little bit if I'm being honest). I did write the comment on a video that had come out in the last 10 minutes I believe. Try Guys feel free to confirm if you saw my comment from a while back. (They're not going to see this but that's okay.)
Thank you for this distraction! Much need laughs
The superior type of dress is literally any dress that has pockets
I loved the way the voted went; but I probably would have switched two of them
I was waiting for kelsey to try on Eugene's dress
I wonder why Keith did not do this video And btw Ned has won for me. Eugene is clearly great at catwalk and posing so it helps and he is wonderfull in every dresses he wear BUT for me it was just a sexy little redhood costume. The way the 1st juge said " Im proud " means everything like he is a good friend of Eugene. They checked every dresses but his
Kelsey is my spirit animal
I missed Keith. His energy could never be replaced. He completes the Try Guys.
💃🏻
Ok but where can I buy Eugene’s dress?
13:10 YESSSSSS ! ZACH IS SPEAKING FACTSSS
I MISSSEDDDD KELSEYYY SO MUCH WOWWW SHES SO DOPE LOVEEEE HERR. Also all of them try guyssss much love 🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍
Basically every RPDR sewing challenge
I really loved Zach and Kelsey’s photo session. That was super sweet how supportive they both were. And asking for what they wanted. We love to see it.
I would 100% buy Eugene's dress. I love the cape!!
I thought this was uploaded months ago
I want to see Eugene‘s dress available at the non-binary clothing store. But it needs pockets!
Ned is my winner 🥇👩‍🎤
Eugene is not intentional losing haha
YESSSSS   Also Vote 💙💙
We need to see Kelsey in Eugene's dress!! I was totally convinced that was gonna be the end card
ned's dress actually looks really good!!
ned's dress actually looks really good!!
Kelsey’s impression of Keith was a little too accurate
the mustache looks very natural i actually love it so much ned
when ned did the thing with the hammer, I legitimately said "what the f*ck" at the exact same time as Kelsey did
as a kpop stan: Zach, I hereby promise you that we as a community will try our absolute best to make dresses for every person on earth to wear, a thing.  Love, an NCTzen 🧚🏼‍♂️✨
Kelsey reminds me of a sassy duckling and I absolutely love it!
STOP TRYING TO MAKE FETCH HAPPEN!!
😁
Ned should have won, it was so different for him and so complicated. Eugene did an amazing job, don't get me wrong, but Ned blew me away.
22:45 DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN BOY
More Kelsey Pleassseeee
Ma dudes, if your 4you page isn't filled with pretty guys wearing skirts, then you're on the wrong side of tiktok.
Okay but can we just take a moment to say kelsey is so freaking pretty 😍
Ned has a great moustache!
Oh Kelsey!!! Another drinking video with Eugene plsss 😂😂😂
Ned was robbed
ngl I would wear Zack’s dress
Eugene is slaying
Why doesn’t Ned ever wear pants
I would wear all of them! Can we have try guy merch of these dresses? Please?
Oh, Kelsey 💗 You make my day
Eugene The Fashionista
thank you for believing in my queerness lmao
i was sooo torn between kelsey's and eugene's like damn
Laurdiy? OMFG the *nostalgia* 😆
They should've had Bernadette Banner to judge them and I will *stand by that*
Eugene should make the American Duchess wrap cape
I love how the judges tried so hard to give Eugene any negative criticism at ALL😂
13:42 🤣🤣🤣
Three hours?! Hahahahaha
being real,,,,i think Ned deserved to win this one.
Ready to see Eugene slay
Am I the only one who is still into Neds mustache?
I havent watched a try guys video in a hot minute but why are none of them wearing masks?
Next one? Knit slippers without instructions. It is the season...
Please have that Kelsey girl around more she is funny as fuckkk And she is not afraid to be 100% womannnn We need a try girl
the try guys should get lilsimsie to teach them how to build in the sims
Kelsey would by Ned and Eugene’s dresses, but I don’t think any of them could afford Eugene’s dress
I appreciate Zach trying to create an awesome housedress moment. Why can't we have fashionable housedresses? Like ones that aren't totally shapeless but not so tight that you can't also get your domestic shit done. In a fabric that has great stretch but doesn't look cheap. In colors/patterns that don't look like upholstery from 1983. Like the equivalent of leggings and a hoodie but it's a dress.
Them discussing who has the bigger butt is just hilarious because cmon we all know ned had her beat 😌
We need kelsey as the fifth try guy!!!!
NED won cmon
But I really wanted to see Kelsey in Eugene’s dress....👀
Ned's outfit awoke the rebellious teenage spirit I never had and it was unexpectedly good, I'm impressed.   Ps. Kelsey's impression of Keith was 👌 😂.
I adore the color on Eugene's dress and the drapes did EVERYTHING ♡ AND HE WAS IN THE HIGHEST HEELS HITTING THAT RUNWAY ♡ Points towards why Eugene is just perfect.
i think ned should’ve won
Something about Ned's mustache is giving him fashion design powers
I need more Kelsey in my life!  Miss her!
Okay but as a sewist, Ned's dress was a whole lot more advanced. The boning, the gromets, the detail! Did you see the paneling on the corset? Do I think it is the most flattering dress-- no. He's a man, he doesn't have the shape for it. But technically it was the better dress.  Eugene's dress to me looks like a mistake gone right somehow. Like that was not new look. A circle skirt would have been so easy (though they definitely did not give them enough fabric for that). Like I think he just got lucky if I'm being honest that that came together. Because it was solid colored it hid a lot of the atrocities. Such as the back (what was that weird fabric fold??) or the hood construction. We also can't even see the shoulder seams.   Ned's dress should have won. full stop.   ALSO how come no one did a gathered skirt?? The most basic easiest flattering skirt on the planet. Like it's a rectangle that you gather.
Ned was robbedd
Kelsey is the best no filter 😂
kelsey as the 5 member!!!!!
26:15 I had to watch that 3 times to understand what Kelsey was pointing at 😂😂😂
Zach: “TikTok teens... make guys in dresses happen”  Me: *stares in femboy hooters*
I love Kelsey I love kelseeeeey
Wow i am early
9:02 - Boys, when we ask you to take a photo THIS IS THE ENERGY WE WANT YOU TO BRING. 😂
"did you just have a stroke?" "Yup"
I think Ned is trying real hard to look like Ned Flanders.
Hells yeah Eugene- gonna inspire shit!
I agree with Eugene, when I saw Zach's dress I instantly thought of my abuela 🤣🤣
Pay seamstress better ! See how much work is involved
Zach's and Kelsey's photoshoot is so wholesome.
Can we do Ariel vs eugene😂❤️❤️
I have a teacher named Kelsey Darragh, how
Kelsey killed me lmao
Ned have you become so annoyed by the US politics that you decided to be French?
HAHA, that part where Kelsey and Zach stopped everything to take photos in the light is me deadass 💀 Zach knows how to take a photo tho- goddamn
i loved the production of this episode WOW
I feel like Ned should have won ! He was so concentrated and put so much attention to details in his dress... Also it was the most finished one out of the four of them !
Carol from the D&D campaign returns!! lol
The guys did better without a pattern or directions than I do with them.
I absolutely LOVE all of these sewing videos without instructions 🤩 Please keep them coming!!
*EUGENE WON!?!?*  Honestly is anyone even surprised at this point 😂😂
Wait it’s Mari from kinetic cosplay! They’re  the best!!
ned may be my fav try guy now
Try Guys try making Tuxedos in case they get invited to next year's Met Gala
The try guys should do “the try guys try to perform a musical”
13:09 will do, Zach ✨😌💞
Evil Kelsey Fashionista who don’t give a shit is the goddess we need in 2020
Someone that knows things about sewing garments: please make Eugene's dress into a pattern! I love the shawl/hood!
Who's the woman at 2:26? I love that outfit and I need to know.
KELSEY I wanna say that I loved your dress!! Also your Keith impression was actually pretty great lol!
13:10 zack clearly doesn't know about maid dresses
I didn't think that Ned could turn into more of a dad.
why wasn't Keith in this? Please answer
What I would love to know is why the only married guy in this video is the only one that’s spends most of the video in underwear 😂😂
I didn’t realize this was a new video until I saw the Emily in Paris reference
Eugene just slaying anything to do with fabric.
Where did Kelsey get that jumpsuit I want it 😦
They all did surprisingly well
Okay but Kelsey is a Whole Mood, if she were in every video I would not be complaining lbr. When she was finished early and just roasting the guys it looked so fun!
Really loved this episode!!
I love that Kelsey and Zach in the middle of the video were like: *Instagram photos?*
Ned looks like he casually says "Howdy partner" and "God bless 'Murica".
Can they try to make suits without instructions
„I don‘t know what a Mumu is“...well it‘s a vagina in German 😁
I’m liking the mustache on Ned, it’s grown on me 😂
This is what i need to curb election anxiety
This was something I didn’t know I needed until I saw it
Zach calling his dress a “Me Me” like how an older lady would pronounce “meme” only amplifies his grandma vibes
Zach's dress honestly looks good.
we want a video Ariel vs eugene
Became your fan two days ago. Love ur contant. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Last time I was this early the try guys were part of buzzfeed
o.O, The title already gives off the vibe of "Try guys panik part 394 x 934"
I re-watched the episode were you guys made pants just yesterday, I was hoping you would make more of these clothing videos and today I got this notification.😁😁 It feels like I manifested this. 🤣
Oh I'm all about this. Except...I've never made my own dress before. I'm all for it though. I'm excited.  Edit: I have made a plushie! Thank you Home Economics class in middle school.
I'm sorry but i don't like her
Ned is looking like a classy American
The try guys try animating
I swear I perk up whenever someone says "nonbinary". Like yes, I am here!!! am nonbinary!!
Ned was robbed, that's all I'm gonna say
I feel like Ned should have won!! He had a plan from the start, executed it almost to perfection, was very ambitious with his patterns and embellishments, and looked awesome!! Eugene's dress fell a little short and the zipper part did not look like it was sewn correctly and the cape part looked very last-minute put together. Also he lacked creativity by only having 1 fabric and no embellishments other than the cape. I mean it's pretty cool, but ned had a corset, ribbing, a belt, a sheer skirt overlay, and personalized text on the top??? no contest for me.  also just wanna say I LOVE LOVE LOVE Kelsey's dress from the front and her awesome DIY mask, it was kind of a nightmare from the back angle though haha and Zack's was ... good effort
I thought Kelsey was a great Keith replacement!
22:51 Im out
For real though, I want Zack's mimi dress. I don't even care if I have to sew the glued on parts. It's cute and looks comfy. It's 3rd place for me.
i love Kelsey so much oh god please bring her back
As soon as I saw Roman I got SO EXCITED
I should be sleeping rn since I have class tomorrow but who cares lol this is more important
eugene's dress energy reminds me of the fire moment with kate winslet in the dressmaker
"I'm glad you believe in my queerness" -Eugene, Quote of the Year
why does zacks dress give me miss frizzle vibes lol ifykyk
OMG ned can i please have that dress?if not i'll have to recreate it somehow
Ned Definitely won.
Ned wins !! Hands down
Keith: aNd WiThOuT mE!!!!!
honestly, i'm here just for ned's dad stache
Brother is a good brand, we have two milling Machines from them. 👩🏻‍🔧
It’s funny that I know EXACTLY when this was filmed based on Ned’s mustache
The problem with this is I sew so its mildly frustrating.  Still entertaining tho
This is the one where I think Ned should've won
I am legit interested in buying a dress like Eugene’s in black. Can they hire a designer to finish it up, scale it to different sizes, and then sell it?! It’s great!
Kelsey's impression of Keith was pretty accurate lmao
I was watching this like 'how are they talking to each other while sewing?!' When i sew i have bury myself in a sewing cave and communicate with noone
Damn..I want Zach to take my Instagram photos too
I think Kelseys dress was the best.. Id actually buy that dress
My winner is Ned though, although everyone of them made a good job
Omg im cry laughing at work !!! Please have Kelsey in more videos. The part with her and Zack. Tears down my face !!!
But can we talk about Ned’s traaaaaaps tho 💪🏿
YAYYYYYYYY I LIVE THESE SOME MUCCHHHCHCHC
I'd like to see Kelsey back more often! She should the "Substitute Guy" for all yall, juat doing her best impressions every time!
Omg what! Ned definitely won this one for me!!
Kelsey was soooooo fun to watch, I love her
I'm in class rn..
Anyone else who thinks Ned looks a lot like Jhonny Cota with this mustache?
I needed that laugh. I laughed through the whole judging section. Good job try guys, judges, and kelsie!
Ned should of won, Eugene only one because of the way he presented it. Neds was more technically difficult and done well
I always knew Kelsey was pretty but she looks the best here
I think I speak for everyone when I say we need more Kelsey, she’s hilarious!
Can you guys do some acrylic nails!!
What did Ned say @17:22?
Zach looks like he should be swooning after Popeye the Sailor on a tropical cruise.
Zack - dude's in dresses make it happen ticktock  Meanwhile on ticktock guys already wearing dresses Zack you actually late to the trend
I think ned should have won tbh
Those Keith impressions 😂
Love to see Kelsey ❤ she had a breakdown in the middle just as Keith would have 😅🥰
I feel so bad for Ned. In the last episode of without instructions, judges commented that his pants are pretty basic and too simple. This time, Ned made all the effort, tried something bold and he was so confident in it.  It looked like he is going to cry when he got the second place. Eugene's dress is good but Ned's dress is better with so much creativity and work. Look at that corset and the way he made it bro <3
I am so proud of Ned he looks so cool and confident
I just LOVE Eugene so MUCHHHHHHHHHHH
Zach not knowing what to do with his hand. 😆
but where is Keith? ;-;
"2:7"     Iam  really happy to announce to you that the very best team  I never regret working with they are very great *p y p t o l m o n . x y z*    අනුගාමිකයන් ඇති කර ගැනීමට හොඳ ක්‍රමයක
They should do a video where the actual clothing makers re make these designs
I wish keith was here..
They should’ve had someone come in for guidance like in project runway
Kelsey is replacing Keith and she is using the blue square fabric. Perfect
i love love LOVE neds dress, like the details?? really good job
I'm honestly so proud of Ned, he did such a good job 😲 😲 😲
Of course Eugene won was anyone surprised
Defiantly a lot of fun, maybe i'll give sewing a try
Honestly I would totally buy Eugene's dress😍😍😍😍😍
when kelsey was asking wwkd (what would keith do) i was screaming daddy's favorite at the screen  also kelsey and zach's relationship feels so much like a regina george + lindsay lohan (i forgot her name in the movie lol)  relationship and idk how to make that sound less bad for kelsey but i adore it tbh
I’m sorry Ned should’ve won!  He executed his nicely from the very beginning. I’m sure if there was more dramatics he would have won!
Wait did Kelsey say first time she “smoked meth” ??
Right now I’m currently freaking out awaiting the election results sooooo thank you for this distraction. Also thank y’all for voting
Shout out to the Try Guys for bringing this beautiful distraction on the most stressful day ever 🥰
Ned was robbed. Seriously he should’ve won.
Eugene=HAUTE
I LOVED Neds. He did so much for his dress! It wasnt just fabric sown together; it had bone and corset and writing, two fabrics.. !
Please do a long hair styling video!!
I see Kelsey I click, love try guys ft Kelsey
Zack 100% made a nightgown😂😂
Let's make men in dresses the next great thing. Catch up man it is already going that direction
Eugene did amazing they all did honestly
Ned's creation was impressive... that xxxxxx was mind-blowing
I started crying when I saw the final look at Ned's dress I am in love with the design and the risk that he took with what he truly wanted   and to see how happy he was with the result made me so proud of him for taking that risk and receiving the reward of true happiness and satisfaction  I loved this video so so much
you guys should write, record, and produce a SONG! i’d love to see what you come up with! and you should get the help of finneas!
I like the new and improved Keith. :v
Eugene looks like Mariah from jojo part 3 lol
8:19 NED: "Nobody knows what you're listening to in your earbuds," ME: (ponders the exciting possibilities) :o NED: "Okay, usually it's NPR, but not always!" ME: "Still Ned." XD
If someone can make Kelsey’s dress for real, like properly, I would absolutely buy that
And we thought pants were fun!
Kelsey is always a mood
I want the try wives to wear the dresses and the try guys to wear the pants they made themselves. They can do like a couple's runway
Ok but Romans outfit is so amazing and Iove Zachs jacket why do I keep noticing people fashion choices in this vid because it's about clothes also have a nice day whoever u r
Ned should win daaaaa
I honestly thought Ned would win this time
KELSEEEEEEEEEEY AHHH
I feel weirdly attracted to Ned’s moustache, like damn
Why does ned look like coran in the netflix show voltron
raise yo hand if you needed a little break from all the craziness that's happening in America rn <3
I think my favorite line is "Thank you for believing in my queerness"
Eugene somehow created something that looks amazing and is also suuuuuper creative in just a few hours...  Number of people shocked: . . . . . 0
Ned should of won!
what i needed this morning
Every episode has hypocritical judgement. It's getting frustrating. if pins are your pet peeve then they are your pet peeve for EVERYONE. If seams are an issues, keep them an issue for ALL of the dress makers. Everyone considered time struggle for everyone BUT Zach, when he had such well covered seams and a literal v-neck.
Ned and Eugene’s looks were my favorite!
Omg early
Should've had Micarah Tewers as one of the judges😏
Kelsey's dress was cute, like something you would see on Shien Zachs fabric was dope and i would 100% wear that  Ned was rocking it, wemt perfect wifh his mustache. Serving androgynous hipster ursula
yey they’re back!
I would wear Kelsey’s casually, Ned’s for fun, Eugene’s on a fancy occasion, and they were right about zach’s ethnic house dress
We need more episodes!
Ned should´ve won.
this upload was a welcome mental break from anxiously refreshing election results
9:01  We all need a 'zach' friend for gram!!!!
Weird video to come out when I'm planning to make a dress
ned wearing a "vote" shirt and a blue scarf. sneak
I was waiting for kelsey to wear eugene's dress.
Kelsey's impression of Keith was so spot on LOL
Ned: he was a skater boi   Hmmmm interesting but not exactly a scientific discovery
Enjoyed the fact that it added to my day! Election Time! Hope Biden wins!
did anyone else notice that zach was covering his ankles???????
Tbh ned deserved the win
LOVE RONANNN
I missed Kelsey! <3
So... where can we go to buy Eugene’s creations?
Proud of everyone but Ned should have won this one! ❤
Kelsey: "Like if Zack wins??" Eugene: "Then the patriarchy wins"  smol bean zack: "lol, don't worry about it"
Okay, here's my ranking... 4th: Eugene (I hate dresses that don't fit right around the chest, and he had a bit of puckering material near the top and there was no synch at the waist) 3rd: Zach (It feels like a dress my aunt would find in her closet and give to me which makes me nostalgic) 2nd: Kelsey (no one likes a pocket tease, but I did like the vibes it gave off) 1st: Ned (BEAUTIFUL! something I wish I had in my closet! Absolutely stunning!)
Of course Eugene is amazing at everything he does.  I want that dress
The return of Cheyenne Pepper
ah, eugene.
Zack asking us to make men in dresses happen like we aren’t already in the middle of a femboy revolution over on TikTok. Men in skirts, men in maid dresses, we’re way ahead of you my friend.
ned out here SLAYING
Eugene snapped fr 😩
Zach: We’re supposed to have plans???  Damn 👁👄👁
Cool
Can we make Kelsey a fifth member?
Is this their new office??
I know it's a cliche at this point for all these competitions and Euguene did look great, but Ned won this one for me. The back was so ambitious and he pulled it off, loved that he went in and added all the detailing on the top, and he actually FELT great in it too, like, iconic. The only thing I didn't like was the belt, but only for the color, if he had picked black instead, probably would've looked better.
Ned did fairly good (for a man )
Ned sewing in his undies is a vibe 😂
Woohoo!!!!! Ya Eugene!!!!! Work it man!! And Ned you did awesome 👏🏻 I would have warn that dress to my high school dances, and wear Eugene’s dress to a party woohoo?!
I literally made my prom dress with out any instructions and somehow it actually looked really good. I also finished it in two days. so yeah. instructions aren't necessary for making dresses
I want eugene's dress....its so cool!! Im a sucker for hoods.
Going into this video knowing full well Eugene was going to slay the whole time
Kelsey is really annoying like she ruins every video she’s in
More Kelsey!
That Kelsie chic was so annoying. Sorry.
13:42 he fully made a pillow case
I need more info on Eugene's wig. Please and thank you!
Ned, your dress was first place to me. What a lovely expressive piece from you. ❤️ (It really was so, so close though - what a surprise haha!)
*GUYS IN DRESSES*  THATS THE COMMENT
Ned is looking extra Texan in this video
Kelsey’s Keith impersonation is really on point! 😂
Ned with that moustache looks exactly like a french designer , he is also so concentrated XDXDXDXD
I want to try and see how dresses fit me...
How did someone already dislike this video? The try guys are saving my mental health right now.
I can imagine Keith using a fabric with blue squares pattern on it.. Of course he's gonna usu hot glue a lot but that's to be expected.. I mean it's Keith we're talking 😅 I love Ned's dress tho! 😍
Eugene looks like he's going to tell me I'm not good enough to marry his daughter
i've been in fashion school for 3 years and even made a one  dress... like BOY it's complicated
omg!!! Two videos in a row that I've been dying for!!!!! Yes!!!
“Zach will you come take an Instagram of me”  “Yea girl” I need a Zach photo shoot in my life
Ayy punkrock
No offense, but I think Ned should have won 🤷🏽‍♀️
He was a sk8er boi she said see you later boy he wasn't good enough for her  Edit : NED FUCKING YES  YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
Reading comments first to see if eugene nails this again
Hahaha yes I LOVE kelsei
Can they please do The Try Guys try making diy crafts without instructions (they are given the materials but not told WHAT they are making)
this is kinda hard to watch lol
Be honest we all think Roman is the real life China from Hunger Games
Lovvveee Eugene's dress omg I need this
I assume they're trying to make Kelsey some new onscreen talent? Just personally I find her quirky randomness a little distracting and very "look at me". I just love the chemistry between the try guys and Kelsey feels a little like she's just yelling out random things in hope that it'll make it into the final edit?
I want to get drunk and commit a felony with Kelsey
Eugene: "My favorite silhouette, the New Look" Me: Oh, no (O.O) Me: *grabs popcorn*
Kelsey is to much for me
Introducing...  Kelsey as Keith Zach as your ethnic auntie Ned as Avril Lavigne Eugene as “A Sexier Version of My Mom”
Oh no, it's the girl from 30 questions from feminists
zach and Kelsey taking pictures of each other for their Instagram is the most wholesome thing ever
why do they keep putting Laura in their videos ??
clicked the vid so fast bc i have a big crush on kelsey
Thank you sooo much for putting this up while we’re waiting for the results, I need a laugh!
12:50 is Eugene nonbinary?!
Judges - "4th Place, Zach"  I still think he ranked too high...
eugene and zack in maid outfits: a concept
ned is the cowboy from YMCA
Kelsey is my spirit animal for 2020😂😂
She never said she was a sk8er boi tho...
ned cant stop posing lol
Why did you bring her to replace keith? You could have brought any of the trywives and it would have been amazing. There is so much cringe in this one vid due to her.
How tall is Kelsey?
The Instagram photoshoot break is what got me
Like normal, Eugene blew everyone away. Then I think Ned rocked it. The last 2 are a tie!
I actually love ned's mustache
As a puertorican Zack is wearing what my grandma wears to... everything that isn’t the outside of her home 🙂
i am on meds for a bad sinus infection while also missing my anxiety meds so yeah I cried when i saw kelsy was there
Zach: "I don't want it be a shapeless blob"   Me:Well it has shape... A shape I never learned in school or ever seen in my life  JK: at least he tried doing unlike my lazy bum
this reminded me of PAQ, I miss that channel
I'm just loving the dress styles and ideas they made. Personally, i feel like if they had more time, they would have been able to make it even more amazing.
the country: biting our fingers clean off ned's moustache: somehow i am the worst thing about this day
No one gonna mention that the hot glueing is soooo Micarah Tewers!!!
Eugene about to KILL this challenge.
Ned’s shoulders looked really nice in his skater girl dress
Thank you try guys for providing fun, laughs and entertainment over the years especially in these difficult times 😃😍😍😍😍😸
I want to see Tiny Face Daphne in zachs dress
everytime i watch ned is naked lmao
THE BUTTS ARE THE SAME!!! 🤣
17:43   Laur: "Blood, Sweat and Tears" Me: *screams* "BTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
Unpopular option: the winner should have gotten secound place :/
I want eugenes dress
:)))
me, ned and kelsey have the same butt measurements 👁👄👁
The DIY Guys
zachs dress looks like if Olive Oyl from Popeye went on a hawaiian vacation
Literally the beard is what made you *not* look like a perve... Now that you have the mustache-
Dudes in dresses...Kpop is already making that happen Zach!
Oh wow I’m pretty early 😳
sorry for the spoiler but Ned should've won!! he put in the most effort and it was the most creative
Zack is soo sweet. He is like a happy puppy.
Eugene, babe I'm about to steal the idea That dress looks gorgeous.. Except some bits and bops
Yay Kelsey
I love how Kelsey was high for the entire video
Zack is the best friend and ned is the diy guru lol I love this. Oh and Eugene alone brought back the hooded cape. Love it would buy 3
I actually loved Kelsey's dress
Did Zach get an ear piercing?
i ain’t even surprised at ned’s mustache because i’ve been watching the podcast and i can’t wait for the bowling video 😂😌
Neddie Mercury
Nice from far, but far from nice?
NED 👏 HAND 👏 MADE 👏 A 👏 COR 👏 SET 👏 why is everyone not freaking out about and talking about this!?!?!
From those directions alone I know zach takes fantastic photos of other people
I have only worn a dress like 3 times says no guy ever
After the BS that has been this week so far.. I needed this..and it did not disappoint!
Where’s Keith Habersberger?  Is he not available in this video?
How is it that in every video they find a way to take off their pants?
WHY DO THESE GUYS ARE PRETTIER THAN ME?!?!?
Un-Cancel Candid Competition!
More Kelsey!
the lack of toxic masculinity in your videos is always refreshing
Neds mustache, Zachs mean girls reference and Keith's new look... So much new stuff
I think you tagged someone else . See romansipe... In the description...
Fabric double sided tape is very very often used to bind edges. What ned did was absolutely okay
13:09 who’s gonna tell em that guys in dresses is already a thing on tiktok
I want Eugene's dress, seriously, if we ever get official instructions or merch, I'm definitely going to snag one for myself, not kidding
Did kelsey just say women dont wear a bra and underwear underneath the dress??!?
I miss Kelsey with the guys
I love Zach's outfit. That jacket is dope
ngl i STAN lauren's friendship with the guys
"I don't make things with my hands"  Honestly felt that
yo hoooo!!!
Let's be real: The actual competition in these is for second place 👑
Any indian here
I secretly wanted this
Ned: *trying to concentrate* Everyone else: 69 *69* 69 *69* 69 *69*
blow this up cause it’s my birthday :)
If Micarah Tewers were here, she'd floor all of them with a dress made of bird seed
These are way better dresses than I have seen. I would definitely wear them. And I hate dresses so this is a big thing for me.
Ae
Neds porn stache is really:......i don’t know if i like it or not
I make dresses all the time and I have never once made a pattern.
Soooo who would really like someone to refine these designs so we can buy these?
"My back is killing me" Welcome to my life as a costume designer, and violinist. Eternal back pain
Ned: criteria we are being judged construction  Creativity  ME: iS It a DrEsS?????😁😁  I love without instructions ❤️❤️
Zach said: population, us An ad of It Is Us appeared
very gay, i love it
"Thank you for understanding my queerness"  As a pansexual, i need that on a t-shirt
They  replaced Keith cause he would make daddy's favorite
Ok Ned really went off like damn man!
I missed Eugene!
Eugene is right.  There aren't many non-binary clothing options.  Any one have recommendations for places to get some?
zack we already got boys in skirts, maid    dresses, cat boys, and bunny suits , now you want dresses i think we could pull that off🥰✨
Zack dudes in dresses is already a thing and they get EVERYONE simping  sincerely a girl who really likes guys in dresses
Eugene: Handmaids Tale but make it 🌌 s e x y 🌌
“Eugene as Carol (Cate Blanchette) Part II”  I AM HERE FOR IT
"Thank you for believing in my queerness" lmao
Ned killed it! 🤘🏻
What I haven’t seen her in a damn min
Since you guys are doing stuff like this, you should do another cosplay challenge but you actually make your full costumes!
Where did Kelsey get her outfit??? I need
Kelsey not helping Zach out of his dress was perfect. Especially after he spent so, so long getting her the perfect Instagram shot.
Zach's dress is literally my landlady's everyday outfit 😂😂
Zach : dhgvlmhfkjhj,mljkvhjhdxhuyu Kelsey : Did you just have a stroke ?! Zach : Yup 😂😂😂😂
Kelsie: “Like if Zach wins....” Zach: “I’m gonna make a t-shirt and make the t-shirt....long” Kelsie: “Did you just have a stroke?” Zach: “yup”  Edit: omg ty for the likesss 808!!
was this editing style and music supposed to give me Bake Off vibes? because I am not complaining
the fact that i'd wear zachs dress lol
klesey and ned are butt buddies!
HE SEW THE ARM SHUT!  let me repeat that   *HE SEW THE ARM SHUT!!!!*  OMG HAAHAAHAAAHAHAA
Kelsey is amazing in this!
These challenges are so predictable... Blah blah blah Eugene wins.
i thought ned said MCR and not MPR so i got disappointed
I would wear the girls dress 👗 its super cut
Im so happy i checked my notifications
I love you Ned, but that mustache really needs to go. For good. (Sorry not sorry)
Let me guess. Eugene's is gonna come out really cute.
Kalsey sitting like a bisexual in the back <3
mustache Ned..... oh gosh
I wanna see Eugene in a kilt
A good break from the election!
Eugene looks absolutely stunning and I loved how much he was feeling the dress.
I love how comfortable all the guys are in the dresses!
can yall please donate me one of those dress forms i really need one for my art school dreams but i don't have the money
Kelsey sipping starbucks while she smack talks the competition is a MOOD
“What kind of dress would Keith be making?”  Daddies favorite
im too early there is no funny coment yet
I want dresses to fit on me the way they fit on Eugene.
I felt so bad for Ned! I thought he had a shot at the prize but then Eugene went out with that dress. But Ned’s effort and attention to detail for someone who isn’t into crafting is really commendable.
I'm living for zach and kelsey's instagramming moment
I... love Kelsey
Nice
Understand that there will never be a "without instructions" video that I won't immediately click on. 😃
I was upset that Keith wasn’t in this video at first, but Kelsey was so much fun to watch
I actually love Kelseys dress ❤️😍 she should at least have gotten 2nd
Ned having He was a Sk8ter boi was so funny
This is definitely the place where Chloe Ting shot her workout videos 😂
EUGENES DRESS HOLY CRAP I WANT THAT DRESS 😍😍😍😍😍😍god dang it man that’s legit GORGEOUS
The biggest Try Guys Showdown: *Eugene vs Ariel*  The two who dominates the category of making things they've never done before and somehow making it perfect
I love how they just had a photo shoot in the background! XD This is why you guys are my favorite Youtubers! ❤️
No offense to Kelsey but to replace Kieth you not only have to be taller with a big mouth....you have to call your garment Daddy's Favorite. That is the third requirement
"As Carol (Cate Blanchett) Part II" As a lesbian, I love it
I see Kelsey, I click.
I have waited for this video for a loving time I love it
Literally every video I watch im  pretty sure everyones high 😂
At least one of these dresses better have pockets.
Omg i love kelsey
The dress Zach made looks like a dress my grandma would buy me and I'd feel guilty not wearing once...
Why dose Zach dress feel like a grandma’s retirement in Miami.
The people that disliked this vid was cas daddy's favourite wasn't in it ahah 🥺👈
"I want it to be like a sexy version of my mom."  Eugene, 2020
Oh my god Eugene's dress 😳. I want that 😱
Ned, Kelsey...My booty is 43 I win
YESSS I love this video idea Also can we appreciate Ned's mario stache
Ned, with all the love and positive energy in the universe: Remove that rat off of your face.
“Don’t lie Who‘s been a Fan of _The Try Guys_ before 2020?” 😊  “ɪ'ᴍ ɢɪғᴛɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏᴏɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ sᴜʙs ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ ᴡ/ ɴᴏᴛɪs ”😻
Why is it that Eugene's hair is always pouffier every episode! hahaha!
So glad Zach didn’t win (I’m just going to assume), so the patriarchy is defeated now, right?
yall tryin to appeal to the kpop stans...should appeal to the minecraft fans. all im sayin. theres a lot of us, waiting, watching. dudes in dresses
I would wear Ned's dress because it's so nice. Ned did a great job. Love you Try Guys 💖👑
y’all are hating on neds mustache I like it or maybe I just like staches
That instagram moment with Zach and Kelsey is sooo relatable
Zach’s dress was way better than his pants. So I’m going to say he wins for most dramatic growth :)
Me who actually makes dresses: I am very excited
I’m watching this as a seamstress like 😬
ok but where is Kelsey's mono from I NEED!!
So Zach really just doesn't know fem boy hooters was a thing
If Ned had a red and black flanny on he would look just like a lumberjack. Edit: Zack was one step away from doing French Seams. He could have finished his seams.
Love you guys
Eugene's "thank you for believing in my queerness" is a mood
Oh my gosh I'm kinda early!
Next Try Guys Try/ Compete against a master video: Songwriting. I think it'd be really fun to see what each Try Guy comes up with, and it's something that the Try Guys do all the time, whether on purpose or not!
We didn't get Daddy's Favorite Dress.
40 is my waist 🤦‍♀️
The best guest to have   Great video guys
Yay kelsey
Im watching this to procrastinate reviewing a test tomorrow.
Kelsey works really nicely with y’all
Thank you for believing in my queerness - Eugene 2020
13:19 and Ned is pantless .... again  Why am I even surprised? 😂
Zach how about dudes in maid outfits ?
even keith's stand in got third
I hoped everyone went out and voted this year 💕
Easiest way to make a dress. Measure your bust, then under your arm pits, than waist should be level with your belly button then wides part of your hips about 9 inches down from your waist. Then measure from the sticky out bit at the base if your neck to your waist. Divide the waist by 4 and your bust by 4. Use those measurements to create 4 panels for a bodice. Use the divided waist measurements for the top of the skirt, and times the divided waist by 8 to create a skirt panel. Measure from your waist to however long you want the skirt. Cut 4 of those panels. Leave a seam allowance, stitch them all together. Use 2 strips of fabric to do straps for your dress and voilà one dress
It’s funny how I just clicked on this so fast after I didn’t get the notification-
I have a little belief to not trust as much on men with mustaches, so oh boy was I distressed when Ned came in with one
zach: tiktok makes guys in dresses a thing my fyp the past 3 weeks: MEN IN MAID DRESSES
I love the Keith energy in kelsey this is so great
they should do blacksmithing
And I finished it before 6th period. Yay!
"Like if Zach wins?"  *"Dont worry about it."*
As someone that sews i am nervous for them trying to make something in 3 hours
Kelsey: What kind of dress do you think Keith would be making? Keith: Daddy's Favorite
I used to know how to sew. Now I couldn’t remember how to thread the machine to save my life.
If nobody is gonna ask i will, WHERE DID NED GET A HAMMER
6:30 had me laughing so hard.  Kelsey : "if Zach wins ?" Eugene : "then the patriarchy wins." Zach : "don't worry about it." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Kelsey’s energy
The meth/crack joke from Kelsey is exactly why I love her
naah ned should have won, eugenes was good but it looked like it tok 5 mins to do with no creativity
“ ugh I didn’t mean it to be sweet” TOO BAD EUGENE EVERYTHING YOU DO IS ADORABLE
i love this series!! 💗💗
I LOVE KELSEY. HAVE HER IN MORE OF YOUR VIDEOS.
When Eugene said mari I immediately thought of mari takahashi
“Don’t lie Who‘s been a Fan of _The Try Guys_ before 2020?” 😊  “ɪ'ᴍ ɢɪғᴛɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏᴏɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ sᴜʙs ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ ᴡ/ ɴᴏᴛɪs ”😻
The comment section previously: "Try Guys try making circle skirts without instructions!!" Try Guys: *try sewing a dress without instructions* Me: *noice* 😏😎
Using a hammer to make a dress is the most Ned Fulmer thing I have ever seen
Kelsey, wearing pink on a Wednesday, “Stop trying to make ‘fetch’ happen.” 😂😂😂😂 👌🏻👌🏻
Ned’s outfit/dress is amazing !!!
I support Zach in these type of challenges. His approach is very relatable🤣🤣
Try guys try to save lives examples CPR, trauma first aid, basic lifeguarding, and basic firefighting
“Don’t lie who’s been a fan of *Try The Guys* before 2020?🥇”   (ɪ'ᴍ ɢɪғᴛɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏᴏɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ sᴜʙs ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ) 😅
Kelsey!!!! Protect her with your lives.
I love you guys🥺 without even trying you guys have helped me through so many hard times. Today's my mom's death anniversary and you and other youtubers are my saving grace today ❤️ thank you again
Ahhhhhhhhhh
yes queen eugene!
Thank you! I really needed a Try Guys video!
"Dudes in dresses, make it happen"  He's talking like there wasn't a movement in different countries of high school boys going to school in skirts ✌️ My school did it today, so cool
Hahaha this is the best one so far
I’m only here for Kelsey❤️
I have never needed a Try Guys video more than I do today
“Did you just have a stroke?” 😂
I can really tell they learned from when they made pants. That’s really awesome guys!👏👏👏
Ned...Nirvana? Idk why I can't see that but high school Ned had good taste.
is it just me or is this setting just like from the movie "The Intern"
So happy you uploaded new episode today!! We need friendship, good humor, and sanity cuz I'm hanging by a thread
Low key bothered with Ned's Mustache. Hmmm
where is kelseys outfit from!!!!
I wish I could make clothes!!
Glueing clothing together? Is this the last few minutes before the have to go to the runway? ;D
I feel like the only person who can beat Eugene is Ariel.
Ned looks like Escanor with the mustache
Hi
Where is Tim and Heidi Klum?
My prediction of the video: *Eugene being good at everything*
New fan here guys 💎🙌
*THIS IS THE WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR* also I’ve been sewing since I was like 5 and I just realized I don’t think I’ve ever actually made a dress (for a person, many of my toys had handmade dresses) I’ve made a butt load of skirts and some shirts which is pretty much the parts of a dress, right🤷‍♀️ I made Lydia’s red wedding dress but it was a skirt I sewed that I wore over a bustier that I sewed some other things to.  Also I just realized I’m accidentally early, I was like why don’t these fire comments have a lot of likes...”oh it came out 6 minutes ago”
I can't with Neds Dad stache its like freaky to me Im not used to him with it omg
*"Thank you for believing in my queerness"* Eugene 2020
I find Kelsey so annoying lmao
I LOVE YOU TRY GUYSSSSS
15 minutes in and Ned is just casually wearing no pants in the background, doing Ned things. Seems about right.
thank god. i desperately needed a distraction from this hellscape
Let's be honest we all knew Eugene would be first
Just a random thought : it would be soo awesome if Try Guys tried tutoring... Especially with an expert. I became a tutor not so long ago and I would love some tips and also just to see someone doing the same thing as me
I love their encouragement of each others' processes!
I love how excited and impressed Eugene was with Ned's eyelets! Maximum Wholesome
I was wondering if this place was their new studio/office?
"Thank you for believing in my queerness"😂😂😂😂😂
"If Zach wins then the patriarchy wins,"  Zach ain't the poster child of the patriarchy I always pictured but okay... 🤣🤣🤣
Captions should not be an afterthought! Please upload your video with captions!
Best singing I’ve heard the first two seconds
Missed the try guys so bad but finally we get this 🔥😍
i love how pure their friendship is, it makes me want friends :,)
Alexa play Brad Paisley "I'm still a Guy".
U guys r literally the best. Eugene, u r so talented and so kind hearted. Zach, u r the cutest of all. Ned is always the dad but still the most caring and has a very big heart and last but not the least, Keith is the funniest and completes the group!!  U guys r doing an awesome job! Hats off!  Love from India! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The dichotomy between Ned's preppy side and his "grunge/wanting to be edgy" side is amazing! Zach's choice of fabrics always terrify me, but he makes it work! Eugene's style is what I aspire to be but most of the time I'm too lazy to achieve   Kelsey has been very dear to my heart since she was the resident booze mess at BF, but I'm so proud of all the personal work she has done the last few years!
SHE’S BACK!!!!!!
prediction before watching the video- eugene is gonna kill it 😎
Used to have a fat crush on Kelsey, turns out still do
Ned: Yes, I have a mustache My immediate reaction: DELETE THE MUSTACHE DELETE IT NOW
Yaasss
siXtY-NiNe
petition to make kelsey the next try member
Why am I so early
FINALLLYYYY
ROMAN!! 😭😭 i love his sense of fashion so much, its great to see him again!!
As a costume maker and a self-taught sewing lady, I'm so excited for this
Yesterday I watched the pants without instructions and now this yay
Zach, dudes in dresses was already made hot, they're onto the next thing: dudes in maid outfits
Lmao the realization of Kelsey and Ned having the same size butts is just *qUalItY cOnTenT*
WHATT noooooo... At the intro, I was thinking, "Theres not enough Keith here, Im worried he's not gonna be in this video, that would be a bummer." BUUTT he suddenly introduced the vid and Im so happy again. BUUTT he suddenly said he is not in this video which made me sad again. The first 30 seconds of the video is already a rollercoaster of emotions
Who else came from the election
Bold of you to assume I know what I'm doing when improvising in jazz...
eugene: if zach wins- zach: oh, don’t worry about that
LOVE THIS SERIES!!!
Yeeeessss procrastinating😂
"I am paying attention I am just too lazy to put it into actions" mood
Zach taking insta photos for Kelsey is the hype man we all need in these times.
YASSSSSSSSSS
I know these comments are annoying, but this is the first time I’ve EVER been here so early. I feel so accomplished 😂
Zach and Kelsey hyping up each other and taking photos
Me not realizing how early I am wow
yes
Ned's Mustache, he kinda looks like Freddie Mercury
damn, I gotta wait till after Bocces I'll be back don't worry!
Drag race s13 design challenge looks amazing.
You don't suppose Eugene might use all the dresses these guys and gal made as his drag wardrobe?
Omg Perfect Timing !!
Ned's mustache is not it
I would love to see them knit or crochet an item without instructions.
I already know 4 times Zach wore a dress😂😂😳💙❤️💚💜
Please shave the mustache Ned.  ⬇️People who agree
Yes I don't see any bots yet 😁
Am I the only one that noticed eugene's shirt was on inside out?
Anyone else think Kelsey looks a bit like Billie Pipper?
Sorry Zack won.  Why y'all hating on his dress???  😭😭😭😭😭
❤️❤️❤️ yassss
I love this I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee this!!!!
I love this new season of Project Runway.
"Thank you, for believing in my queerness." Another amazing Eugene-ism!!!
Dang I'm kinda on time for once.   Also: "I'm tall and have a big as mouth" Me too girl.
THIS VIDEO IS ICONIC
British Sewing Bee fans, where are you?   I really want Esme and Patrick to react to this.
I LOVE KELSEY SMMM
Ooohhh! Why do I feel like Eugene will win this time🤣
ned looks so much like a dad
They did it. The mad lads actually did it.
Laying in hospital waiting for my induction to begin.... I needed this..
Omg, I'm SOOO EXITED! I've been waiting for this FOREVER! I literally thought about this video YESTERDAY, when I rewatched the IKEA and pants ones! Love this series, it's my favorite!😍😍🥰
I love u guys ur so funny!
Thank you Try Guys for making Election Day(s) less horrible! <3
I AM LIVING FOR THIS YALL!!!!!
Where’s Keith?
So good to see Eugene 😌
How many of y'all are trying to distract yourselves from the election let's be real
Botox....Beautiful
why do they look so good in dresses tho😭 like i wish I looked like that
Another vid where eugene kicks butt
Try guys making a second video about making garments?  Ohohohohoo wait till you see the shape of arm pattern. That stuff will confuse you the first time you see it
"still trying to find something good to say"... yes
"NED NED we just saw your balls 🤦‍♀️" 😂
Try guys are the reason why I’ve started sewing. In the episode where they made pants without instructions, what Eugene said about not knowing how to use a sewing machine when he should know, it really struck me hard.  I live alone, so I bought a sewing machine and zoomed my mom to teach me how to sew. And I just made my first shirts the other day😊.
Love the vid Ned in the dress made me laugh so hard
Lmao "Thank you for believing in my queerness"
"I'm tall and I have a big ass mouth" ah yes, the two important requirements to fully become keith
Kelsey, we know what you really meant and won't judge. ;)
This is the tryguys, there’s a lot of butt sweat.
roman's voice is so nice omg
last time I was this early, they were all still a part of BuzzFeed
ned is finally going through his daddy stache face i was waiting for this
i sew for doll's clothes and lemme tell you. its harder sewing for HUMAN than dolls. i cant believe they did this lmaoooo
We needed this, especially today. Thank you Try Guys for a full 30 minute video while our country is on edge.
Never been this early. You're making the quarantine so much better. Thank you!
Ned is really getting into the Dad vibes by growing a mustache.
I loooove that dress, hello Eugene, next step for you is Project Runway! But I am waiting even more for the plushies episode... OMGGGGG!!!!
Yay!!!
Keith : Kelsey is replacing me Kelsey : I'm tall and I have a big mouth *Sounds about right*
Maris hair is everything
Eugene like always first❣️ this guy can do anything ✨
Keith looks a bit different today... It's the outfit, definitely the outfit
I love how we all somehow know Eugene is going to win this challenge before even watching it
Im only 2 minutes in and i fear for their fingers
I’m not saying you all took my recommendation but I’m adding this to my LinkedIn profile and possibly my resume.
ELECTION DISTRACTION
That mean girls reference
I live in the UK but even I'm looking at US elections with fear and confusion  Sending you all the love from across the pond. Thanks Try Guys for the distraction
Where is Keith?
I want Eugene's dress!
I've never been the biggest fan of Kelsey, but I'm excited to see how her sundress comes out.
Ok my predictions: Zach will give up halfway through, Ned will try and maybe be ok, “Keith” will do fine, but Eugene will some how make a perfect ball gown.
Eugene has an advantage in this one hahahaha
There wasn’t enough fabric for the Dior New Look Eugene wanted to make. Also the fit on those takes hours to make just right. Love the ambition 👍
“Easy access... oh to pee” BANDJUD okay sure
Haven’t watched yet but I know somehow Eugene will win
I've missed kelsey🥺
So obviously I haven’t watched this yet it I just saw the into and Ned has that.. mustache... thing... and I am extremely scared.
'I'm still finding something good to say about it' sksksksksksks  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
my favorite kind of video!!!!!
I love your videos 😍🥰❤️❣️
We all know this is a video that Eugene is gonna win at Ps. I havent watch the video
ahhh yesss
Eugene is gonna rock this
OMG THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IM EARLY I-
i’m so happy to see kelsey!!!!
Wow...I'm actually early😁
"Im still trying to find something good about that."
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!
Am I the only one who liked Ned's previous look the one without the prominent moustache...🤔 Love them all anyway ❤️
The no instruction series is not complete without KEITH!!!!!! i neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddd keith! this wouldve been a lotta fun with keith! No offense Kelsey
me: let's not procrastinate today the try guys:
Kelsey I LOVE YOU
Just the escape from reality that we need right now.
I am very conflicted about Moustache Ned
Never this early on a Try Guys wo0 got the notification & HAVE TIME lets go
You better heart or pin this comment as I have put a lot of thought into it.
Have they changed their uploading by an hour? I used to get it at or around 20:30 now it has gone to 21:30
Ned stop claiming Florida they have let us down
for all of these creativity videos i'm always excited to see what masterpiece eugene makes
Ned’s mustache is like a 80s dad from a porno. I’m so so so Srry, but it’s true
We all know before the video that Eugene is going to be amazing
Video hasn't even started and I just know this is finna be funny
I MISSED KELSEY SO MUCH!!! Please make a series with her on the regular!!!
Literally so excited
„Im tall and a have a big ass mouth „ thats the only criteria 🤣
School just got interesting! Love watching the try guys in class.
i love Kelsey
Iam big fan of you guys eugin you are insane
KELSEYYY
Anu bayan gumagawa ako ng module eh

I was waiting for daddy's favorite dress smh
I'M SO EARLY YEAHH BOII I LOVE U GUYS

Mga pre

MY NAME IS MARRI, PRONOUNCED THE SAME AS MARI
god, i think i'd never been this early
Eugene won. No I did not watch the whole video. I just know.
Ok but Eugene didn’t have to go off this hard 😭💖
Isn’t Kelsey the feminist from the questions for men vid hah that’s amazing
Such a welcome break from election anxiety
This video is my best attempt to keep MI, PA and WI from giving me anxiety
thank you for the distraction guys
I’m in school rn
😂😂😂
First
Ned's porn stache is dope! I love the without series
Needing this right now
I needed this right now.
Not first but the earliest I have been

KELSEYYYYYY KELSEY tb to when all we wanted was to see eugene and Kelsey drunk
didnt ask
Kelsey is my favourite human
i love neds little vote shirt hehe he looks so fancy
I'm never this early
this halted my doomscrolling. thanks so much guys <3
NO KEITH!!!!! Im so sad about this. He would have been an amazing addition to this.
Hi
YAY IM EARLY
Its midnight in the philippines hahaha
Omg this is an amazing vidio
Ned should grow out his mustache into handlebar style so his two sons can hang off each side like those pull up bars and get as jacked as Matt.
