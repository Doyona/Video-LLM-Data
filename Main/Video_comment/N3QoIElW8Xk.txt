Deji just casually playing in his kitchen.
in jjs defence of the bomb kill on lachlan, the bomb was on cool down, so he couldnt have placed it
16:39  Lachy casually predicting his future 😂
who's watching this while eating pasta at 08:18 on a Friday morning?!
Last round was craaaaazyyy
Danny's iq scares me....😭
i wish they didnt do what XQC's crew started doing. I wish the ghosts would stay silent until the game is over. ruins it a bit when they start screaming or talking before the rest know they've been had
0:20 the perfect role for Viz

27:22 Iconic Chipfat edit
How silly is lachlan to repeat Danny's mistake with his bomb lol
lachy is dumb too
danny is dumb f him
37:51 literally none questioning about danny existence
33:05 Deji: I'll just have to stay alive...*proceeds to walk around by himself*
24:42 The wealthiest sideman btw
6...7!!!??
KSI IS SO UNLUCKY IN THIS GAME , LMFAO
JJ bombing ONLY his teammate and no one else has me dying 😭😭

1530
The day they stopped bullying JJ in among us will be the day they have brain cells
1:23 that’s a bit rich coming from you Deji
Idiots.

20:37 The second he hits a note, I’m like “yep… man’s about to be chopped mid-chorus” 😭😂🤣
Subscribe guys lets reach 10M its would be fine
What is up with Danny Aarons voice in this video???
8:28 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂see you later boys
We all think u should just use mullet at this point cleet
I love watching these at 2x speed because it’s already pure chaos but at 2x speed it makes it pure madness
23:38
6:36 is hilarious. Danny almost had the harry kill but jj had to kill deji 😂
15:09 Peak trust right there😂
Randy's stress blink has me laughing all the time 😂😂😂
The concept of bomb is all lost on danny 8:28
37:02 epic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chip is actually the best editor of all time
Why’s Danny Aaron’s sounding more and more like daffy duck
It’s nice seeing Danny having a childish hooded
They couldn’t let Vic in a bombing video 😭😭😭😭
Love this
21:57
I discovered sidemen by among us
Randy is as brain dead as pie
3:14 lazar😭😭😭
6:28
Danny is the dumbest gamer person in the world
Please bring speed and kai to this game
Who else is rewatching this? I am bc idk what else to watch while I’m eating
lazar beam is the most entertaining individual to exist on planet earth and you CANNOT convince me otherwise, literally anything for the sake of content man gotta love him
@RandolphUK u r a great WOOMATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There should be a silent among us. So you cant talk you can only report and vote
lachlan screaming plant the bomb JJ then dying from the bomb has me crying
landon has that setting where your eyes lock to the camera
If Danny Aarons sabotaged he would have one!
The more i binge these, the more I respect Chipfat🙌
12:20 "We will be safe without Danny" 😂😂😂
8:29 28:55 29:38 29:52 LMFAO😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wouldn't be a sidemen among us video without lazer destroying good monitor 😂
Why do the imps keep venting from elec to cams thats so dumb😂
1:21 and in this moment a monster was born
36:08
32:52
32:18
9:20
Josh is so dead
IoI
@3:15 Lazar destroying his monitor when he got killed at the start of the game KILLED ME IN LAUGHTER 😂
23:40 MAD
1:22 and little does he know he will become the cam merchant
Tobi and his victim complex always moaning gets on my nerves.
Josh with norway fotball tee💪🏼
“You had enough time to do that?” “Yes” “Alright, good enough for me”
This randy is the guy in the group that wants to act intellegent but not
13:25 look on how that kill of KSI on Deji looks xD
1:19 Deji finally understands it now
Tobi is SO Whiney
30:21 jj being jj lol
Goated episode
2025 gang
23:40 That timing 😂
20:40 harry's singing is legendary..

37:44 the Australians r so funny
6:00 Bro how has Deji just said MF to his own brother 💀
A painful watch
everytime the bomber killed themselves or their teammate:  1. 8:24 (danny killed himself and jj, the other impostor)  2. 10:50 (lachlan killed himself, deji, and randolph)  3. 23:37 (jj killed lachlan, the other impostor)
Sidemen make among us better cause they play it like a serious game instead just a fun silly game 😂
Randolph is so jarring man.....😒😒
Deji's laugh man......
Josh saying “and me” at 36:20  has me busting up 🤣😂
I love the way Danny say's "See you later boys" so confidentally, like he's cooked, when, even if the bomb didn't kill impostors, neither Simon, Randy or Josh where in the bombs radius.
The fact Lachlan says we have to slay😂
7:51
.
jjs laugh at 44:36 is exactly like scooby doo lmao
0:00 “Prepare for the biggest throw of all time” Me: *NOT LIKE THATS HAPPENED IN SIDEMEN BEFORE-*
They need to always listen to Simon. He is the best player.
3108
“Little big man” Deji is like a poet
Lannan goes through a moniter an episode
its 9m its time to 2 hours vid
23:39
Lachlan killedhimself TWICE with the bombs. How can someone be this bad lmao
gummy zerka
Why do some on you have a shout and scream it’s so off putting
Best video ive seen for a while
How many thing does lazar have to just smash on the side
SPOILER BLOCKER ❌❌❌
Lacherby bomber masterclass.
42:00 "posthumorously" bit ironic
Play supers sus
8:46 monkey laughing
1:20 Harry and deji Have now switched 😂
Is Randy really dumb?
deji is a dumb man
why wasnt vik there i wonder
8:29  brainless 😂
Man, Tobi laughs quite like a Hyena
When Josh, Simon and Randy are questioning JJ when he was imposter with Lachy all he had to do is mention the fact he was running with Josh at the same time that Lachy would have died and the fact he could have killed Josh in admin and they would have turned on Randy , Randy was the only other one that wasn't being cleared in that meeting. Josh cleared Simon and Simon cleared Josh they asked Randy and his answer was "I'm doing tasks" 😂
watched
8:02 23:28 WHAT THE ACTUAL F**K🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
. 😊. O
31:42
Nice  video 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know, lachlan doesnt get the credit he deserves...that man is the worst player in sidemen among us history 😂 he literally just learned the previous round that the bomber can kill themselves then IMMEDIATELY did it. And I genuinely cant remember a single big brain play by him but hes constantly throwing as impostor or crewmate. God love him though 😂
Anderson Betty Johnson Brenda Young Charles
Come to Zürich Switzerland. <3
the fact they voted jj without any proof ruined it
36:10 Zerka😂😂
23:37 heeelp 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Among us
MAN THESE VIDEOS ARE FUNNY AF 😭😭😭😭😭
Sidemen among us + food = best combo
At the end of games  Imposter forgets that they have SABOTAGE 😂
6:58 “I can here the smile on your face” 😂
why didnt danny call sabotages last round omgg
I feel JJ’s pain 11:17
Alt. Title  Sidemen among us with Bomber role but JJ is always the imposterrr
the funniest bit was when harry saw josh's dead body and was like "do i report it or leave it? i think ill just leave it" 😂
danny is really ret*rded innit
Why is this audio breathing in my left ear 😂
This is stupid frjsjsib t done soshrbdoahej
Did lazar Acc break it
12 15 25 30 33 38 42 45
8:25, 11:15, 15:30, 23:30, 36:10, 43:50 😂😂😂
sidemen on top
You explained everything so clearly
Josh so trash
Honestly Harryoke is my favourite bit about these videos
See ya later boys🤣
Randy is actually the dumbest human ever
Hearing Deji say “How is cameras fun bro” is the funniest and most poorly aged quote ever lol
Classic!!!!! #Danny
Who’s here a year later watching old sidemen among us videos😊
Idky deji wants to be imposter so bad either he kills jj first and he gets voted out and if jj isn’t playing then he screws it up on the first kill and gets voted out anyway
13:16 JJ was right
“And me” 🤣🤣🤣
Simon saying he “doesn’t care” ruins the video icl
IF JJ was smart no one could beat him not even simon or danny
Ksi yawning is fuunier😂if you agree like the comment 👇
Randy pissed me off, he's actually slow
Lfmao
21:16 JJ looking hella autistic
Osama bin ladens favorite video
How could Harry like this and now all Deji do is cams 😐
Little if randy i
7:55 YOU KISS DOGS! 🤣
Little did Lachlan know that history would repeat itself nearly a year later...
If the whole lobby is on one point and the bomber plants the bomb who wins?
Randy completely threw that last game 🤣
Important: In order to fix the game giving Impostor to the same people, go into the settings and fiddle with the number of Impostors in the game, then set it back to normal.  Among Us sets who the Impostors are based on the order of the players joining the lobby, which hardly changes when the same players are in the lobby for multiple games.
3:11 i laughed for 5 minutes straight i love u lazar
Watch this over 5 times now
Spoiler blocker❌❌❌❌
7:55 YOU KISS DOGS
7:55 "YOU KISS DOGS!!" I've been looking for this lmao
17:15 did anyone realise how Danny's character colour just changed 😮
KSI and Deji's laughs bring me such joy.
15:16😂😂😂
Do lights lol
I  Love your videos
8:25 😂😂😂
I didn’t realise this is where Deji started his cam career 😂
I wiped my phone screen twice because of lazers walls in his room being scuffed. 🤦‍♂️
Laser is the only smart one tbh  Also Danny just shut up you’re so bad man
seeing lazarbeam actually say nice things about danny in these videos is weird
Deji's Cam Merchant arc began here
a year later. am i the only one that thinks it was lachlans fault and not jj's. lachlan literally walked into the radius.
36:19
randy is so stupid he was with lazar the last round and still voted for him in the end
Danny “you idiot”  Also Danny “blows up his teammate”
36:10 "honestly I'd had to take all the blacks out" - KSI/JJ🔝
LAZER must stop braking computers
9:47 Why does he keep throwing monitors? Fr tho
3:14 that was a red flag. I feel like goes to rage room
Always same imposters man so boring
Bro last found why didnt just danny kill one then its on imposter 2 crews i think he wins then he can kill normal he just trying to bomb
Deji has the best laugh ever
Well here no one is the fan of Deji's laughhhhhhhhh!!!!!
Nah jj left his bear toy😢
36:10 “and me” I CANNOT💀😭
Deji : im always crewmates it’s boring  Gets mayor Also Deji: 33:04 this is too much power
Good thing Vick wasn't in this video 💀
You know what, fair play to Danny on that last game, genuinely seemed smart at times 😂
What a Danny masterclass
Spoiler blocker
THROWBI...MY GUY IS SOO TRASH AT THIS GAME ITS HARD TO. WATCH
23:45 got me laughing loud at 4:00am 😂
Josh is senile now, allow his brain fog.   Salute to the old Josh. RIP
Best sidemen among us ever jj bomb 😂
36:18 when Josh is sat quietly listening to JJ say “had to get all the blacks out” and says “and me” 🤣🤣🤣 easily in the top 5 among us moments
23:40
Who else is here after seeing lachlans short
Harry: I think I leave it there 😂😂😂
15:00 guys pause the video at that exact time🤣😂
How tf does deji asks why harry loves cameras and doesnt do anything else himself nowadays
I love how you can still see the hole in the wall now from when Lazar threw a computer at it.
PRESENT HERE!!!
The bombing roles this round really didn't do well huh😂 great video otherwise
‘Get rid of all the blacks’  Josh ‘ and me’ 😂😂😂
7:50 🤣
46:22 but she’s dead
Ksi is mental bro
36:10
Deji in every single video complaining about being crewmate xD
The fact that 3 of the oldest sidemen in the final 3 of that first round and they're laughing at the final meeting is legendary 😂
Josh is one of the blacks for sure
12:50 poor aaron getting voted out 🤣aw
terrible bomb placements
what would happen if everyone died to a bomb at the same time?
H
RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN👹👹
l'impostra
l'impostra
l'impostra
Danny became an muslim real quick with the suicide bombing
It's sad they could not figure out that once you place the bomb, you have 3 sec to move out of the area.
Nahhh even though jj killed lachlan, he still played this game sooooo well.
34:17 "Lets do some Lights"  *closes the door to electrical*
4:54 "I want to bum someone... I just want to bum someone"  -Danny Aarons 2023
3:23 why does jj has a so big bottle?
me encanto todo 😅💙
Tobi ruined the last game, Man cant control his anger... ruined the game by speaking after being killed
seeing a pre cam merchant deji just breaks my brain
The irony of Deji trashing cams
6:00 bro literally called his brother a motherfucker.... I'm dead 😭🤣
4:00 Deji really is a bit slow, in a lovable way. Danny just makes annoyingly stupid plays.🤣 10:10 precisely, Simon
Would lobe to no how much non sidemen get for these videos bet they love neing involved 😅
Cant believe how bad JJ is!  He's definitely not playing, he really is think as pig shit! 😂😂😂😂
They got to an ambulance but only 8.5 million followers or something. Why can't just everybody gets watching the video like and follow so they can keep doing what thay'r doin becus thay are so good.
They got 10 million views.But I have only only eight point five million or something followers away from just everyone fucking follow please
1:20 The irony of Deji saying "How's this fun?"
Lachlan and Danny got the IQs of Patrick and spongebob, respectively.
Harry: Dannithy Aarons 5 seconds later: I don't actually know who killed me
😅😅
why does JJ never use the vents
so glad deji doesnt get imposter often because he just kills jj first the best content man there.
17:05 DOUBLE MARINATION
Randy is so stupid
No one: Terrorists: 4:54
Bro I put Dejis laugh in 2x speed its hilarious Put 20:35 in 2x it’s too funny
This mod is one of the funniest to watch 😂
Randy, Josh are FKN DMB AS FK!
l'impostra
Danny DUMB DUMB Aarons. So STUPID.
danny saying idk how to use a bomb and than winning the last game with bomb was so cool
The foreshadowing of Deji asking how is cameras fun
Just watched another video of Deji on cama all game and first words out of Deji this video is being on cams in boring LOL
you guys cant do my guy dannyaarons that dirty man
Get loserfruit in so she can play with lannan and lachy
23:46 poor lachlin😂
8:31 😂😂😂Danny wtfff😂😂
Deji’s laugh is so goofy
Lazar is very rude to danny
Best part of the video 23:29 😂😂😂😂😂
Randolph swooped right says he seen jj but forgets to say he seen him go towards electrics and cams direction
❌❌❌SPOILER BLOCKER❌❌❌
Deji saying cams isnt fun but thats  all he does these days😂
Bro Delhi went from how is cams fun to cams is very fun
12:40 gotta take it danny!
Also, we can't say Lazar complains too much, just look at Toby... When he dies first, he cries like a baby but when he stays alive for long, he says he wants to die...
Can't believe i saw the day Danny played with Lanan lol
Look at your first shot your gold
Even if it's unpopular Danny's opinion is right about JJ being a decent Impostor He did the heavy lifting last round, killing 3 people, and he would've got away all of them if Lannan didn't come up with that "odds" bullshit
Let’s goooo
Need to see proxy chat in this.
Although Deji is funny he is not the bright at all. He has zero listening skills and comprehension
Tobi is just annoying
9:16 and 16:20 deji is just straight up sad😂
SEE ANOTHER DANNY ARRONS  - MOST DUMB DISASTER CLASS
Tobi needs be removed from among us
this is where dej becames the cams guy
I’m the richest person in the comments on blood ngga gang shi type shiii
Danny needs to clear his shit
WhY iS sImOn PuTtInG sAuCe On Me 😜
What the hell was Dannys dog doing in the backround
I literally subscribed cause MY MOM DONT STINK
23:31 The way he was excited just to die on the bomb😂
This vid is the best among us imo
In retrospect Deji questioning Harry’s enjoyment about being on cams is so ironic😂
Harry is hilarious
lol
7:30 😂
23:38 proves KSI is not Knowledge S***** and I*****. there was no knowledge in that kill whatsover lol
P
23:38 biggest fumble
live laugh love sidemen
better than any sidemen sunday
36:10 Josh:And me😃  Had me rolling 😂😂😂
From this moment on Deji became. Camera merchant😢
28:11 you see all the bugs flying around randy? that’s gross
turn to GOD and repent men Through CHRIST, GOD bless you all GOD loves you all,pray❤❤❤ Repent=knowing your sins, confessing your sins, actually feeling sorry for your sins, asking the ALL MERCIFUL GOD for mercy, and changing your ways
turn to GOD and repent men through CHRIST, GOD bless you all GOD loves you all, (pray)❤❤❤ Repent=knowing your sin, confessing your sin, realizing your mistakes, feeling actually sorry for your sin, asking the All Merciful GOD for mercy and forgiveness, change your ways
Jj saying the imposters suck 3x while he’s the imposter is so bait 😂
16:33 best round
At 4:22 why did Lachlan say he saw Tobi when he’s not even in the game ?
Am I the only one who cant stand Danny Aarons?
Sidmen among us is the best
😂😂😂😂😂boooimmm😂😂😂😂
i love lazar
Deji laughing mid conversation is Hella funny
this was amazing i laughed my ass off 😂💀
Danny just so fucking good. Dont know how he continues to get away with stuff.
Randy is the worst player.
Do they invite randy intentionally?, mad how bland he us aha
11:55 Harry violation
I hate watching these videos because of JJ. If he wasn’t here, the world would be a better place
40:35 scooby doo ass laugh
4069
2:46 LMFAO the way they just run to the vent to hide
Lachlan-I don’t want to get bombed  JJ-Oh fuck
Danny is so fucking hilarious in these
DANNYYY
8:11 that's not 'smart' Danny, that's f8cking schewpidd
Deji: How is this fun just being on cams?  Also Deji: becomes a cam camper
why is tobi so sweet.   HIS LAUGHHH 😊😊
Deji “How is being on cams fun” Proceeds to be on cams every game after this
30:22 50000IQ albert einstein
Deji and ksi be funny asl
I love deji’s laugh😂
No Ethan is a breath of fresh air! No Tobi as well would be PERFECT!! Tmo guys, sorry not sorry.
46:24 this made me subscribe
Makes me wonder why Vik aint playing
What was danny kissing 😂😂😂
This episode was Banger 🔥🤣 JJ bombing his fellow imposter was too funny 😂
toby brings absolutely nothing to the sidemen
JJ's water bottle is huge
A
Randolph is a mongo
denji's lagh is cringe af
Randy is the most annoying person to ever play among us
Lannan, Simon and Danny were moving like Death Note💀
Think Toby means Cane and Unable
The bombs backfiring is so funny. Anytime JJ Say this whatever stinks or sucks, you drink. Lets go! (I wanna see Deji as a bomber with JJ as a teammate and I dont even care what. I think thatd be hilarious. Love both their laughs, and idk, I think itd be awesome.)
Why has deji decided to set up his stream from his kitchen
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
L bottle #Spursy
That bomb was so bad its hillarious
this is so funny
Can’t stand Tobi on among us. Idk what it is about this game but it brings out victim and moan energy 24/7 and is just boring
36:20 ”you are a bunch of african americans and mark”
18:55
Randy definitely takes it up the ass
36:16  And me :))))))😂😂😂😂 Loved that
I'm a huge fan of your channel! ❤
the fact that danny could easily have sabotaged and bombed so many times in the last round 🤦‍♂
Okay. !
love this vid
11:00, 36.10
Randolph is actually dense
Randy and Ethan just throw every game
My god JJ is such a funny killer
8:28 true suicide bombing
1:21 Bro is saying this now but bruh in recent videos he is the one who stays in cams! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
danny has proved that he is missing quite a few braincells
What game is this? Can I play on PC for free ?
Can we all agree that deji’s laugh is nightmare fuel
I like the Norway t-shirt
what possessed randy to say woomate😭😭😭
it took me a second to realise danny aarons was kissing his dog and not smt else...
Just needed to get the anger out...
No KSI
back when bomber wasn't shit
Watching this years ahead and seeing Deji talk junk abt harry in cams and now a days that’s all Deji does 😂
I think Randy might have a touch of the DS
Naa KSI is the funniesy
I'm crying for lazar 😭
That was hilarious 😄
Me, my siblings and my cousin, all 4 of us play among us and like just troll people. The killer will just be one personn, When we got a random people get in the lobby . If one of us get the impostor, we will troll people like we don't see who's that kill or something XD, and then at the last player we will troll them like running around them before kill them. Or if non of us get impostor we will track that guy down 😂
37:50
Jj stick get so angry when the imposter
randy saying woomate hurt my soul 😭
lazer us so good i wann do something with him
Put this in the sidemen among us playlist, its not in there
37:00 Danny’s biggest brain moment.
If there are two impostors left, then if there are the same amount of players then the impostors will win. 😐 Stop thinking there are still 2 impostors 😩
how can i play with those mods aswell
Danny being imposter is the most boring shit ever....
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
24:55 Anybody else heard it? Only me? Okay 😂
Wtf is wrong with Danny's voice???? It sounds like he keeps saying "I'm gonna bum 'em"
@vjl222 bro this is crazy
I love ksi  ❤❤❤❤❤
How is Simon the only one who’s thought of actually bombing on a sabotage, like Danny my boy it could’ve been so much less brain damage
danny is completely braindead
They are carrying among us lmaoo, Sidemen among us is legit the best thing on youtube
Randy would be so annoying to play with. Seriously, the round just starts and he hits the button for no reason and with no proof of anything.
Need more guys
I think that only lachlans triple kill with bomb was bombers role at perfection
25:47 bro forgot he has an accent
The ending to this video and the SS video with Lazar and KSI are my favorite moments of sidemen among us. Just absolute chaos in both of them and I’m dying while watching 😂
Why is tobi always getting killed
The last part of the vid... randy srsly no brain, actually pissed me off lmao
1:26 bro then proceeds to have a camera masterclass during the Warlock video.
Lazar got attitude lol
lul
10:50 & 23:33 & 36:11 🤣
The random voting out for no reason or for a meme actually pisses me off LMAO
Harry just dancing over Josh and asking if he should report the body then answering his own question with “I think I leave it” is just so hilarious
Wazza
I swear I can’t tell if ksi is actually that dumb or just playing a character
8:50 JJ do not use the Lordsname in vain
42:38 Lazarbeam just overestimates the intelligence of the sidemen and pays for it! 😂
36:19 'and me'
Omg they added the indian role
danny is so STUPID LMAOOO I WAS DYINH
As Bomber couldn't you just have 1 imposter fuck around with lights, and as soon as 4-5 people gather other imposter explode all? xD
Am I the only one that finds Deji a bit annoying .-.
Danny aarons ffs 😭
Danny is as thick as cement
Bro created dillion danis😂
Song name at 34:06
How does ur Mic system work
And how is it possible to play modes as sidemen?
Danny being the worst bomber of all time killed me 😂😂😂
1:21 the fact deji says this before what he ends up doing in the next videos is funny
This would be so funny if you guys would play all together in the same room 😂 ( obviously without seeing each other’s computer. The discussion time would be a chaos 😂😂😂😂 im all for it.
Brooo  randy is soo freaking dumb , I get so freaking angry when he speaks
I hate Danny arrons idk if you like him he's just irritating
harry jokes without even trying
Without Vikk the episode is dumb but it's also fun at the same time.
Norge😅
Danny was like “ALLAHWAKBARRR”
Bye doji
Can someone tell him the overhand is the hardest punch! He keeps talking about how much kicks do but hasn’t thrown a single overhand in a fight 🤦🏻‍♂️
among us vikk edition
18:49 Lazar had enought :D
12:40 them voting out Danny Aarons 🤣🤣🤣
it is infuriating to watch the bomber not call lights hahahaha
Icl it's nostalgic to see Lachy and vik to play together man
Dang, my chromebook went a missing or damaged screen, and I fixed it, it happen in the middle of the funny video
Free palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I avoid every video that has Danny Arons
simon is a cheater guys. Look at 30:44 he acted sus there he texted josh that jj was the imposter. This Man could do anything to just win.He sucks.
15:31  lazar is absolutely correct
23:30
danny is a beast!!!!
They need to stop forcing Harry to play this game. Hr clearly doesn't enjoy it whatsoever
Isis role😂
Bro how do they not know u can’t be in the red circle. Don’t they know red means bad. Ur gonna kill ur self
Pro y pro y.
Danny coulda just voted out lannon
The fact deji just laughs to himself is so good 😂😂😂
I didn’t used to enjoy sidemen among us vids.. but damn the low IQ in these lobbies is actually very entertaining 😂
40:36 sounds like scooby doo
I wonder why Vik didn’t play this game mode 😂
among us muslim edition
Danny Arrons is the dumbest among us player ever
However Randy's brain was working at the end hurts mine to unfathomable proportions
I like how Danny has a hoodie that completely matches his personality 😂
Josh wearing the best country in the world
Why does Harry with autotune sound exactly like Post Malone?!?! Oh yea, autotune.
LazarBeam you don’t complain you have a reason to
This is not bomb mode this is Saudi Arabian mode
Harry “dannothy aarons “ Also Harry “ i don’t even know who killed me “😂😂
8:40 can never be topped 😂
Tobi is such a cry merchant
danothy aarons😂
😮
😮
No offense but Lazer is to smart for this shit he overthinks everything
Danny is a rich dumb ass 😂😂😂
How does deji laugh😂😂😂
what happeed to danny's voice?
Randolph is so boring
it’s DANNYYYYYY AAAAAAAAARRROOONNNSSSSSSSSS
JJ😂
Lannan is the kind of  person with 15 holes in his wall due to among us
why does danny have a hit*** stach
Randolph is so freaking dumb
that JJ's laugh after he killed lachlan🤣🤣😅  Edit: 1k over likes.
KSI  had to eliminate the black guys first
THEY SHOULD DO LIKE AN AMONG US WITH MULTIPLE FANS . LIKE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING WITH LIKE 2 FANS, AND WHEN A SIDEMEN IS KILLED, A FAN SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE LOBBY OR SUM
Danny voice sounds like he has a ball of flem stuck in the back of his throat
Am I the only one who flinched like it was really a fly in my ear at   28:13 🙃
LAZARBEAM
What happens if everyone gets killed by the bomb?
How are they playing among us and on what pc ? Or Xbox ?
Randy is always so dumb it ain’t even funny no more
nice
The dog in Danny Aaron’s a background
NDL
32:41 Danny's puppy Silas sleeping peacefully in the background is so adorable 🥰
Danny in the last game though lmao "Just stand still"🤣🤣 what are the sabotages for  hahahah
Lazar and Danny’s banter is absolute jokes 😹
Randolph is sooooo S T U P I D 😂😭😭
Don't know how im just noticing this but Tobi's hat is absolute flames
ur mom stinck
8:29
1:19 this was too funny man predicted it hahaha
I like how they never Sabotage like Danny and JJ they never sabotaged. You could just call light leave a bomb and kill half the lobby.
Can’t wait for the next among us vid
Randolph fucking stinks at this game 😂
From "You are a fucking idiot Danny" to "let's go Danny"  This was one of the best among us session 😂😂😂
0:35
Deji laugh always gets me😂
Danny is so dumb 😂
KSI bombing his crewmate Lachlan is so funny xD
😢
Mate, how many bloody monitors does Lannan have? 😂😂😂
Nothing to with the actually game play but I can’t stop looking at Danny’s puppy in the background, it’s so cute 😍
45:39 Frickin OG Danny😂😂
36:15 josh has become "black" lol
6:36 Ads every 3 minutes in a YouTube video
A
What happens if the bomber blows up everyone at the same time. Who wins?
Just sabotage lights and plant bomb there
ksi got so damm lucky with that imposter role
On the caaaaaams
Never stop these !😊
0:32
8:10, 23:40
Ready is a idit
The cams sqaud
5:53 has deji just called jj a lil big man
Everyone blowing themselves up 😂
The part when Simon said “I can’t be a suicide bomber if I’m alive” has got to be my fav part
We need another bomber role 😂
hashtag WOOMATE
Lol sometimes I forget ksi and deji  are brothers
JJ: How many times can the bomber bomb?  2 seconds later   JJ: Because thats pretty overpowered if thats the case  Blud made no sense 💀💀
23:21 is a masterpiece had me in tears (From deji messing up the numbers to JJ on cooldown to lachlan screaming to plant the bomb to JJ missing everyone and killing lachlan) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
40:40 “every time is see the little pink fuckin furbie”
You kiss dogs!😂😂😂
Why is ksi white in the thumbnail?
Why wouldn’t you kill or vote out Simon first every single round??
It's crazy Danny thinking he's actually good
Get manny on the next 1 plss
39:45 kill peolple
8:29 Danny from 3rd imposter to 9th crew mate lmfao
Is this normal among us
Danny Back Tf Up From The Mic. You Already Sound Like Phlegm. We Don't Need To Hear It Closer
Lannan's intuition is insane fr fr
Hades and lasar
Vik is not in the video because of the bomer  😂😂😂😂
man dannys puppy so fucking cute man
23:18
This video is a fountain of knowledge.
46:24 they put jj’s mom in there 😂😂😂 that’s a violation.
46:24 josh got violated
Get offended if you are, idfc but randy throws too much.
Lazar behzinga moment
Danny the suicide bomber 8:30
The last game danny did so well not to panick or show aggression. Clean W 🔥
Why is nobody talking about that deji literally plays in his kitchen 😂😂
Randy might be the worst among us player of all time
when jj killed lachy with the bomb xddd
what a fkin masterclass bruv 23:30
Wow the ending of this video amazing play from Danny
how has not 1 bomber used sabotage more. you guys never use it. you always drop a sabotage so no button will be pressed.
lazarbeam top tier dude
I wonder what would happen if everyone stacked up and the bomber set off the bomb and killed everyone
6:12 actually burst out laughing when JJ sees the other 2 enter right afterwards
Bruh… I’m so disappointed that JJ didn’t place the bomb in reactor door and made it go off when they all ran out of reactor. Would’ve been the highest bomb IQ play in sidemen among us.
Literally never
JJ screaming "YOU KISS DOGS!" fucking broke me man 🤣
oi im subscribed but if jj keeps cussing my mum like that im either gonna have to unsubscribe or take up boxing man. that cant run bro 🥊😂
This is legit one of the funniest among us vids. 😂
Danny masterclass
Love how Lazar room has just become more and more like a limbo hellscape with every mental abuse among us sidemen shoot
Great video
Danny aarons is so bad and stupid its crazy
I am surprised nobody screamed Allahu Akbar
I think the sidemen should invite speed to play
13:46
Danny arrons sounds like jaja binks
They're idiots, they're all idiots... but I'm here for it
Deji and Jj have the same laugh
randy is dumb
phenomenal danny performance
11:03 deji just leaving was damn funny
@36:11 was so funny when Josh was like ‘and me’ 😂
Lazar's rage 😅😅😅
I never heard Lachy curse so much😂😂😂
That oh you were frol lazar had me killing 😅😅😅😂😂😂
The way Demi just dropped his headphones on the second round was the funniest part 🤣
JJ killing Lachy with the bomb was funny af
NEVER STOP DOING AMONG US VIDEOS PLEASEE
Is it just me or Danny's voice so annoying in this video
Nah Simon saying to vote out JJ for no reason kinda low but such a good vid
i love the clip where deji kills lazar super funny 9:27
Glitch in the Matrix: Tobi suggesting a drinking game.
These videos are actually so much fucking better without Simon. He's such a twat. People think JJ and Harry are bullies, but it's him.  But iT's A jOkE, right?
I feel Deji's pain with never getting imposter. But I'd like to play with some of the mods, which makes crewmate alright if you get one.
toby's boring man its like hes forced to play a game smh just play it like everyone else he literally comments on everything being said
what happened to danny's voice wtf 😂😂😂
I am quite charmed by how much unbidden joy Deji be exuding
Tobis so soft
Bro im sorry but lachy just ran into two fkn bombs while one of em was his own
Dani one of the idiotic players I have ever seen in my life
More bomber !
Id put it on lights and call it
Deji shouldn't be on the Sidemen games. He is irritating. His laugh is annoying af. Plus he is dumb and not funny. Idk why Sidemen entertain him.
Whoever edited the vid needs a raise 🤑 had me in stitches at the start 🤣🥶
what if the bomber placed a bomb at the emergency button then called a meeting?
нe
No Brain cells just Randolph suspicions 😵 My man finessed the entire lobby
Jj is a good imposter he is the only imposter that save cremate instead of killing them
Why dioes Lannan have so many monitors 🤣
Someone should demonstrate the roles to sidemen before letting them use it.
Remove Randy from the sessions please
Always love these. Just btw i know hindsight is 20/20 but randy, danny and throwbi have a clutch record of 0/10
I am absolutely dying at danny planting the bomb, saying “see ya later boys” and just ending up killing jj and himself and ending the game by mistake 🤣🤣🤣
The editor need a raise bro
11:18 damn
Haha tobi is always whining about something he should give up this game
GOD BLESS
At like 41:00 Danny should have just closed the door...placed the bomb and ran to safety and the game would've been over...
Once they realized a bomber is always a suicide bomber.
Ksi voting for himself is the best moment
Bro it’s like they don’t know what sabotage is
I really dislike randy. Can't replace him tho
4 people, 2 people stick together the whole time, 1 dies, what does that leave you? The imposter 😂 That last decision was crazy by Randy
No matter how old I get, the sidemen are always here. I started watching you back in 5th grade and now I’m a junior in college. Yalll have such a special place in my heart❤ thank you for the memories
Lachlan saying Jj having the bomber role is not good is quite ironic knowing he killed himself the round before
Man the bomber role in among us definitely my favorite video of all time in more sidemen it is just too funny😂😂❤❤
Vik not showing up to this shoot is a tragedy in itself
36:10
11:54
3:09
My mum stinks how dare you I unsubscribe😢
Get angry ginge on sidemen among us
Imagine everone in the lobby stand in one stack and the bomber throws a bomb down. Who wins that one?
23:31 not a perfect timing  8:31 dannys sacrifice  10:52 lachlans accident  2:47 jj idiotic kills
Dany arons is auctually jokes
I don’t get why they invite Randolph , he has to be one of the players with 0IQ🤦‍♂️ literally , think they only need him for the content for when he chokes it for the team
Deji playing in his kitchen 😂
Sidemen among us bring more views than some high budget sidemen sundays
jj beeing the impostor for the third time. intstantly killing tobi because he doesnt care anymore and simon saying he killed himself. must be the funniest shit ever
Naw this shit is too funny bro
Lannan getting outsmarted, or just completely throwing, is the most satisfying thing in Among Us history
“New drinking game guys”- from a man, who does not drink.
If possible upload an among us vid on a weekly basis... No one can get bored of them for sure. Also, please get og sidemen - 7 with freezy, lux and the pack for once man in a vid
The fact that not a single impostor in this episode put a bomb in the light and sabotage it and then blow the bomb there is making me fuming. Im fckng raging the whole episode
What is a rashford? He ain't done shit
It’s been two weeks and still no new among us!? Fuck me
The play I want to see -  Lazar gets the bomber role and it's the 2nd round, he finally gets the bomb set on reactor while everyone is rushing to save the crew.  Danny the Sheriff saunters in and shoots Lazar in an unexpectedly accurate move and before the bomb can reach the 3 seconds to explode Vik the scientist calls the body blaming it on Simon who he had just seen pass as Lazar's body fell. Harry, who had been on cams the whole time blames it all on Ethan who he had seen go into reactor first.  In the ghost zone, the highlight, Lazar throws a monitor with enough anger and force that it is forever hanging out of the wall. A symbol of the rage he feels at the stupidity and injustice of it all...
Among us vik edition
“And the influence of Marcus Rashford” 😂😂😂
I cant get enough of these among us viss
22:21 deji's laugh is mad
😮
Not Simon saying “i don’t care enough about the game” a thousand times in another video
I just can't stop looking at Danny's dog
i really enjoyed vikk not being there tbh
PLEASE MORE OF THIS
what has actually happened to danny’s voice?
bro deji is so loud i had my headphones and he nearly busted my eardrums lmao
jj killing lachlan with the bomb 😭😭
12:00 bru
11:38 L Simon bro leave JJ alone
the way lannan threw the computers man🤣
Simon please get a pop shield of some sort
Why is deli in his kitchen?
RIP Headphone users at 34:25
Danny master class
It's been 5 months since I watched sidemen and Tobi's still an annoying prick
I love deji man
“I don’t know how to do this bombing thing”  After fucking up about 6 bombs. How hard is it to preempt the bomb 3 seconds
There should be a role for the imposter that you can kill someone but it's delayed like you walk past someone click kill, walk away, 10 seconds later they drop dead, would be chaos and very confusing, would be a cool concept 🤣
PLS MAKE MORE AMOMG US I LOVE THESE VIDEOS AND I LOVE THE SIDEMEN ❤
jj is getting lethal
Zerkas kit❤
I love harry
Lazar just needs to move to the UK at this point, every video he stayed awake to play among us lol
we need a simon masterclass
Why does Danny Aaron’s sound different
Imagine your mother stinking because she's rotting in a grave or is cremated.
Danny aarons is the worst imposter. This guy literally doesn't know how to bomb
Ironic how vik isn't here this video😢
Warch amongus https://youtu.be/8mc5BlZCWYY.
Randy nuh av NUH sense
Why is deji in the kitchen?
Deji's laugh around 22:21 reminded me of the Boo laugh.
why does danny sound like that
Ksi is class😂😂😂😅😂
Did Danny really say he wants to blow them when they are standing still?
You could have a five hour round with nobody killing as impostor and all votes would not kick any player out but you still are not even finished with the task bar.
Danny’s voice needs to be different he sounds like he’s gargling marbles ffs
Christ lazar hasent uploaded in ages
when’s the next sidemen amongus coming??
The sidemen should play First Class Trouble. It’s among us with real people
Danny Aarons under water
Danny Aarons is in every video I see
New video idea: Imposters should be able to talk to each other without anyone else knowing who they are.
damn ppl still playing among us
I love among us without Ellum and Viz
It's actually quite cool how Simon and Josh both clock that it was KSI that was imposter after he started trashing the imposters for being bad😂😂😂
KSI VS DEJI in the ring?
Toby looked like Hopsin when he got the mayor role
Yay Arab mod
@ 23:33 Lachy’s screams of agony in the background, as the rest of them continue with their task lmfaoooo
I like how the mark on lazar’s wall made from the last time he was mayor is still there
Ofc the video with a bomber role vik isn’t in it
"Put a fucking bomb down jj" "Fuck" "WTF JJ.... WTF"   Right in the feels i swear hahaha
What’s up with Danny’s voice?
Dveryone who wants ishowspeed in next among us video⬇️
8:18 Danny Aarons might be the smartest, dumbest person alive. 🤣
Ngl Danny Aarons is ruining every sidemen among us video
23:40 can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Plss do another sdmn among us video but you’re names are like me, her , him etc
36:07 look at dannyarrons’s dog on the right
Sidemen among us is probably my favorite videos these are just pure vibes
whys vik imposter every episode
How did you find a picture of my mom? 🤔🤔🤔
40:35 scooby doo ass laugh from JJ. Ruh Roh Raggy
Did the title of this change?
this has to be the best  vid, too many funny moments it’s just great
We miss vik in this lobby man we need him back 😢
Bro, the editing is always good, except for the fucking audio. Guys, please, PLEASE, mix this shit better. You either get earraped by JJ's deep-fried mic and insane laugh, or you can't hear what some people say.
Why does Danny constantly sound like his mouth is full. When he was saying he wanted to bomb someone. It sounded like he wanted to bùm someone 🤣
They should do a game mode where everyone is imposter but they all think that there is only 1 imposter
Alternative title the most 911 game in among us
I WANT MORE OF THE BURNT CHIP
JJ is so stupid 😭😭😭 23:50
Bro why tf is lazar always staring at the camera with his crack fiend eyes
Lazar slowly losing brain cells playing with the sidemen😂
The cremates that don't do tasks ruin the game for everyone else because it means they can never win on tasks. All you do is buy the imposters more time. Some of these lobbies the bar doesn't move because dead crewmates don't do tasks :///
Jj improving as imposter 😂
How do they get their characters like that?
deji's laugh is the most annoying laugh in all of mankind...
Randy is quite literally the worst player that has ever played among us in history
Why does Danny sound like a frog ? First everyone was like tf but now they don’t show interest so now I’m confused
Low key love it when there’s no vik in these he’s to much of a nerd
Laser beam is so smart he got it wrong and still got it right
Make more 😂
This mod should be called the Arab mod (I’m Arab)
Im so happy that among is still going on. I wish for it to never stop
23:23
Why we gotta keep inviting deji
We need more among us vids
Genuinely... wtf happened to Danny's voice?😂
Get ginge on sidemen amoung us
Deji is discount KSI. Man really laughs forcefully at nothing, at least KSI's laugh is contagious his honestly felt annoying cause it was so forced
40:34 JJ sounded like scooby doo
Danny with 999iq plays😂
Don’t know the nerd in green hoodie but my god his voice is annoying
Make a video with 3 impostors that would be a volcanic eruption of chaos
24:43 😂😊
Terrorist mode
Man, best among us video ever!
did they change the title?
danny, you should've stayed still and went out of the explosion last second
Another sidemen among us lets go!
Why is no one talking about deji playing in his kitchen
Lanan is high as fuck
No one:   KSI: I’m Obama I’m Obama I’m Obama
11:55 Harry did JJ dirty😂😂
We need more sidemen among us never stop making them !!!
Y does jj not use the fuxking vents 😭😭
No way JJ actually gives us a masterclass first round and then throws it because of Deji
Sidemen among us is the best no doubt
You could do the prime mod . I am a big fan .
Did the title and thumbnail of this video change?
the bombs are so good
tobi gets so childish towards the end man
Imagine if the bomber role was given to vik 💀💀💀
Editor deserves a raise
Amogus
people need to start venting more after killing just running out in the open getting caught to much lmao
What’s up with Danny’s voice?
Is it just me or is Tobi so boring now :'(
vu
Danny Aaron’s and the influence of Marcus Rashford 😂😂
Sidemen play Oppenheimer Among Us. Also Sidemen cameo in Talk to Me
Someone trade Danny Arron’s a tissue for his extra chromosome
Watching some of  you guys play Among Us is like being stuck In a burning house with no way out!
23:37
JJ bombing Lachlan made my day! OMG! LOL!
Clip Deji calling JJ pigman😂😂😂 5:45
23:40 I’m fucking crying 😂😭
Get angry ginge in one of these
Day 1 of asking the sidemen to play the mimic on roblox
i hate that they say they’re imposter cuz they’re good lol
Imagine a @disguisedtoast v sidemen lobby... Oppositessss
You know what would have been funny in the end as well, if Danny had suggested in order for the game to end sooner, for the killer to do a stack kill, and then tried to place a bomb and either kill them all but escape or kill himself too in the act :D
what's happened to Danny's mic lately
honestly the best sidemen series fr never fails to make me smile keep up wit amongus
15:30
30:25  not JJ having a hard time, comprehending what he was saying😂😂😂😂😂😂
I gotta sub after what he said at the end lmao
A mod where the imposters can communicate with each other
we need this mod again so badly
Please teach JJ to use the vents abeg😭😭
WHERES VIK 😭
40:40 Pink furby? Uncultured!
What happened to Dannys voice?
911 in among us
11:53 I don’t understand why no one’s turned off lights then places a bomb there that’s the smartest idea
Danny needs to learn to sabotage
Harry being gone for at least 15 mins then the first thing he says is “I hope he’s killed himself” is top tier
We need a amung us overdose
What's wrong with Danny's voice
31:10 DannyArrons and JJ's Redemption Arc begins!
Danny took revenge
U need to get angry ginge on with Danny and listen to the beef
Easy way to win as impostor, just let Randy live and he will do stupid shit like voting the crew mate that's been with him tje whole time
jj could have a one of the best kill in sidemen among us
What's happening with Danny arons?
😂😂😂
I won’t lie I would just call lights and bomb on the stack
We need a lobby clip where they're mucking around
24:11 Two jj's laughing in the bg 😂😂
How was vik not in the bomber episode
vik's strats are effective.
Is Danny alright?   Ain’t watched his vids in a while but every video so far sounds like he got tonsillitis? Or could be the mic he uses 🤨
these are so funny, never stop them
Josh is an honourary Black man.
I live for this videoss
Why is it that Lachlan barely sounds Australian? He sounds Canadian/American. And before anyone says anything, a lot of Americans sound like they could live on my street, and I'm Canadian. I don't say aboat.   But then again, there's a fuck ton of Indians on my street because there's a college close by, so living on my street doesn't mean much. And there's Australian doctors at Toronto General.  According to one, Canada is cold and horrible and Australia is awesome. But I'd say not having scorpions and giant fucking toilet spiders is good.  I saw a video of someone flushing a toilet in Australia and a hug spider being flushed down. I'm Canadian for Christ's sake and I have an OCD ritual of sorts where I have to wipe the underside of a toilet bowl before sitting down because I'm afraid of spiders or other bugs biting and/or crawling up my ass!  But Lachy is an Australian living in Australia and he sounds like he's barely got an Australian accent.
We should get Jester role with a shapeshifter role. That’ll allow a little more variety in the game. Mayor can also stay cause legit only 4 people in the damn lobby understand it.
Why was the title changed?🤯🤔
All the blacks and Josh 😂
Why is no one doing lights
Lazer is too funny
Danny is so dam annoying
8:55 i cant take danny anymore please get rid of him
Poor lanon 💀
Bro I love the Sidemen but things would have very funny if Vikk played and got the bomber role
They just can’t stop making those videos they’re too crazy 😂😂😂❤❤
I like when dejis in sidemen videos
THESE BOTS ARE UNBEARABLE NGL
42:59 😂😂😂😊
what mod is this
Vikk shouldve got it everytime
Black on black crime. Hate to see it 😢
40:35 scooby dooby doo
They're so dumb 😂😂
I think Lazar is the reason for Australia's favourite word.
Ngl seeing lannan throw his screens at the wall just makes me want Harry to start throwing chairs again🤣
11:54
Harry's like, "HEY! I'm the camera camper in this group!"
I swear to every single god that there was a video about infinite imposters. Did you take it down, rename it, or was that a dream I had? Have I gone mad?
😂JJ got f**ked in the first round, Deji outright set him up.
I wonder why vik wasnt in this one...
Imagine if on top of this Ethan was here
I wish there was an unlimited supply of sidemen among us
This is one of the best sidemen among us vids oat
Why has Simon been such a drag recently
Lazars wall got me cleaning the screen on my phone
This has been the best one I’ve watched
love seeing Among Us however it's starting to get a bit old & boring just voting JJ & Danny for the sake of voting them out, they hardly get to play because they're always targetted
The lazar and danny friendship is  nice
Please bring back voice chat in game
Even if among us is dead sidemen among us isn’t and never will be
Lannan being 3rd imposter is crazy
23:45 This is legendary 😭😭
Could do a weekly hour of this would be class
i wonder sometimes how and why danny is so dumb
Pls do more among us videos
dannys dog is so cute
Randolph is always so dumb in these videos its starting to pissing me off
I just love how harry is excited about the cams when he's a crewmate, & deji out there throwing a fit over being a crewmate 😭
Tobi was so annoying this game. Just shut up man. Stop being salty asf. He was literally just talking shit all game. It’s not like he is the only one that has ever been killed multiple games in a row. All the shit talking towards JJ was just pure salt and not even funny
Bomber mod without vik. Smart
I hate dannys voice
Bro Invite The Lil Indian Kid AKA Zaid ZIZ In One Of These Lobbies This Could Be Really Funny
It will be worse if they were part of tha jury they will be sending innocent people to death sentence & killers go free. Stick to ur utube jobs
Lannan didn't see Danny's bomb kill in cams because he mistook him for Randy lmao
Love sidemen among us vids 🫶🏼
jj: I had to get all the blacks out Josh: and me😂😂😂😂
45:02 😂😂😂
Name a more iconic duo: Sidemen playing with people that have to stay up late to participate due to timezones x Killing them first
U Are My favourite youtuber
maybe try and play with 3 imposters to make it more fun
I miss Bhez!
Landon’s toxic vibe is not the move
We (Muslims) have a role In among us?
Best of the best... #20 of asking sidemen to make a channel specifically for SidemenAmongUs
Best Sidemen Among Us vid
Bro why does Landon always die first hahahaah
Danny Aaron is soo bad at the game.. Don't know why they invite him to play
Hi Lazar
Lol
There should be a sidemen new channel of just among us videos
I find these videos more entertaining than sidemen main channel
Simon getting an impostor is the rarest thing tbh!
JJ dropping a bomb that misses 3 crewmates and kills Lachlan at 23:37 may have dethroned Harry being caught killing multiple times by Ethan and then Ethan getting voted out screaming as the funniest Sidemen Among Us moment
Lazar is fighting his won battle 💀
Danny is the goat
"Wassup with simon puttin sus on me"  at 22:48 is so good xDDD
GO NORWAY !!!!
Danny being smart for once
Blud thinks he has a watch
Randolph has 0 iq
The bomb range was so small and it blew up to fast sidemen can’t do these mods right, just look at speedy nogla them they have so everyone have powers and they play the three different maps but sidemen with 70 iq can’t play a different map…
Does anyone know why Danny is talking weird in the past few videos he didn’t used to sound like it but now he sounds deaf
cant believe lannan just threw a monitor at the wall
Danny Aaron’s masterclass😂
23:28 is SOOO GOOD 😭😭😭😭
Lachy heard/saw Danny kill him self with the bomb Lachy: oh fuck that kills me
I’m glad they didn’t voted out JJ after killing Deji. I remember in the last vid, when JJ was imposter, he was quickly killed by the werewolf in the 1st round & didn’t have the chance to play.
Lachy saw danny blow himself up the round before and then proceeds to blow himself up anyway 🤣
I reckon one of the best bombs would be to sabotage reactor, and put the bomb in the doorway at the right time to get everyone when they're coming out, the timing would have to be perfect though
why does Danny sound like that
L danny
Lazerbeam is the only one making this entertaining😂
Q
Why does danny aarons always sound like he has tonsillitis
this message goes out to ksi. I do not apressiat you saying dissrespectfull things about my mother and want a personaly written apolagy from him thank you.
32:56 I cant even be asked I was dying on the floor with laughter
Na I love when lazar is playing 😂
wonder why they didn’t invite vikk to this one
0:47 LMAO 7:00 11:40 CrEASING 40:05 rashford cameo???
Josh the thrower strikes again. He's rubbed off on Lachy and Danny lol.
"And me" from Josh was hilarious 😂
46:25 they did josh dirty💀
Simon’s new laid back I don’t care attitude is so cool
Deji and jj bring so much energy to every video 🤣 and deji laughing you can’t not laugh with him 😂😂😂
Bring back gta videos please 😢
I love deji and jj going at it 😂😂😂
Missed vik
idk why but I enjoy watching sdmn among us and Gta V more than Normal Sidemen Sunday these days
they gave the bomber to KSI 🤣🤣🤣
The way jj had 4 people to kill with the bomb and planted it and  they all walked away and he killed his own teammate 😂😂 coldest imposter kill
WHERE’S VIK
23:45 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Simon is just boring
Bro Danny’s voice is slowly turning into Kermit the frog 😂
Can someone please compare the kill cooldown to something like a power on fortnite so Lachlan can understand how a 15 second countdown works
Ok haven't laughed in ages so hard hahahah
Oh wow they added viks special ability 😑
simon is such a sweat
One of the funniest sidemen among us
4:54 the US government when they suffer a minor inconvenience
yo
19:06 24:00 32:50 - 33:06 36:11
pov: watching sidemen among us just to watch lazarbeam🥲🥲
This part had me dying 😂😂😂😂 27:22
I think the sidemen should try the game battlebit remastered
VIK WITH THE BOMBER ROLE WOULD BE DEADLY LOL
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Missed opportunity.... SIDEMEN AMONG US : OPPENHEIMER EDITION 🤣
Deji’s laugh legit makes my day
JJ just pointing that out
It gets better and better
Vik has the bomber role irl
randoLph still ruining videos.
Has Danny swallowed a frog or some shit, sounds hella different
Bomber is definitely the best and most fun role
JJ’s bomb was so bad, Oppenheimer would be disappointed 😂
Not the ur mum stinks at the end with Josh’s mum being the fat animal 😭
JJ bombing Lachlan by accident then was the funniest thing I genuinely laughed like a little girl. JJs reaction was like me on mute it was too funny TOO funny : You almost got me to click subscribe for that.
Watched this when the title of this video was Among us but ksi gets infinite imposter role
Come on guys you should make JJ jester
18:45
Zerka using a Norway t-short and me, being norweigan, feeling proud
bro how are they so bad at games after playing for 5-10 years lol or i guess 1-2 of among us call reactor and wait for people to come inside to fix it,place the bomb right after they do it and as soon as they try to leave the room it's boom for 3 people min,maybe more
What’s happened to poor Danny’s voice?
Tobi’s got a good idea, Among Us with a drinking game would be a hilarious vid
DANNY THE GOAAAAT
Good thing book ain't here to ruin the video
lazarbeam makes these 100x better
46:22 Has anyone else noticed that green triangle with an eye in the middle at the end or am I tripping.
Danny played smart today 😁😁
How is JJ allowed to interrupt THE best youtube outro
Chunks should be the bomber in this video  He fits the role so perfectly 🙂🙂
Love how in the last seconds of the video where JJ says your mom stinks, Josh’s mom is the lion from that one video where they react to the fattest animals
I love JJ, but also Lazar. because the last round was really just Danny as the imposter, I really wanted lazar to win it. I’m really happy that after so many among us videos, he got his own round. I hope he sticks around and gets more round without dying
What makes a person SUICIDE bomber           Kaboom
BRO NO WAY THERES AN ARAB ROLE AN AMONG US (im arab calm ur tits)
Pls among US in real life
i shut my mouth for past videos, but seriously its so annoying. Lachland and danny aarons are the stupidest players here and I hate seeing them play. They're dumb on a game and don't know how it works. we need vik and than back.
23:30 Can we just imagine lacklan’s neighbors listening to him at 4am
That was a long round 😂 I was looking at the video when the last round started and thought they still had time to play about 2 more rounds 😂
I wonder why Vik wasn’t present this episode? 🤔
you guys complain about the game taking too long and we just want more content selfishly. either way top notch as always boys. good shit
"Safer without danny"🤣
Gosh I love deji
W song by Harry
Did anyone realize that Toby is so enraged that KSI kills him everytime he is imposter it is so funny 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If only it was the beta squad then this role would make sense
23:41 had me dying 😂😂
More loads incoming, boys. xD
Real ones know it was called ksi infinite imposter glitch
Danny could not understand that the bomb needed more than 1 second to blow up lmao
"do i report it or leave it there? i think i leave it there." 😭😭😭
Where was vik during this video😅
i love how it says bomb lmao but the person that puts it down just sits on it lmao
Tobi boring asf
Yooo did they change the title or sum??🤨🤨 remember it being about ksi being getting imposter consistently or something for the thumbnail
Why tf did Lachlan blow himself up after hearing that Danny did the same 😭😭
Why wouldn't JJ vent from nav when he killed Deji lmao
“I can HEAR u smilin” - Randolph 2023 at 44:45
i would have called reactor than place the bomb at the door so that wenever they tried to leave you could detonate than vent
Randy seems to always have the biggest brain farts
Lachlan yelling at JJ to plant the bomb just to be the only one to get blown up was hilarious. Top 10 sidemen among us moment
Danny literally didn't talk for so long after every kill
Danny masterclass 😂
Why were none of them talking about randy being a bot at the end
This fellas are the youtube goats what a video
NEVER LET THIS SERIES END
Danny Aarons "how do I get them to stay still", not a single sabotage for 3 rounds haha.
did they change the title and thumbnail??
Danny “see ya later boys” continues to blow him and JJ up
bro wtf is going on with danny's voice???😂
Sidemen among us is the best keep making more !!!
JJ bombing lachlan is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while
44:59 Randy.....brain cells.....PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! Lazar, you're also now part of the no brain cell crew
I enjoy how Lazar becomes more unhinged after every episode
no wonder vik couldn't be a part of this
Deji's setup 🔥
Fr what is up with Danny’s voice it’s so jarring 💀
Damn randy is dumb
"pretty defensive for a suicide bomber"
Danny Oppenheimer Arrons
Damn bro the Arab mod I’ve been playing it   Irl
I Love these, #Sideman Among Us ❤
This video made me realize that JJ is smarter than people give him credit for
When KSI thinks about his kills. He loses. When he goes on a thoughtless killing spree. He wins.
Only good sidemen content
Deji on among us is clear
Please daily among us videos
harry dying is the best thing
23:35 😂
Lannan is so smart.
Lazar is so great dude
I need more of this mode🤣❤️
Tobi is so jarring sometimes
Quality!
Even tho among us is dead; sidemen among us is never dead ☺️
Love Harry's singing 😂😂😂😂
Why does Danny sound like Kermit the frog recently
SIDEMEN TRY NOT TO KILL LAZARBEAM ROUND 1 (IMPOSSIBLE) (GONE WRONG)
The sidemen never learns always the imposter says who are we voting for then? and they call him out that its sounds hella impostory but they never really vote him out.
Harry: should I report it?  *takes time so Deji gets brutally decapitated* Harry: I’ll report it, I’ll report it.
jj: just had to kill all the black guys  josh: and me  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Class from Danny. Absolutely world class.🤝
terrorist mode
Lucky vikk wasn’t here for this role… would’ve been curtains
has anyone else noticed that the title changed?
"I cant be a suicide bomber if I'm alive" DUDE
Tobi always talking about leaving when he dies gets so jarring icl
It's always safer without Danny A
loved jj in this seemed more like his old happy self
Why they only active mayor from multiple crewmates roles.. They should activate more of them to make it more interesting for the crewmates.
Lachlan Power : My bloomin Onions 😏😏😅😅
How many of us subbed because of JJ shouting at us??
Deji's laugh is something else 😂😂😂
I can never get enough of the sideman among us, i hope they can keep doing it, and i hope harry and danny sing midgame again, they have very intriguing voices😂😂
34:26 Deji knew he had fucked up immediately he saw JJ😭😭🤣🤣
We needd More of bomb
More sidemen spending videos I miss them
You need to release more of these to feed my habit damn they’re so good!
Tobi is so annoying an just a mega downer. He shouldn't be in among us videos
So much better without Ethan keep him out of future videos
Best vidz ever
The size of JJ's water bottles is getting out of control, that is outrageous!!
man i’m going thru a shit time in my life but u guys genuinely put a smile on my face when i think it’s impossible to smile in times like this
Why I’m I addicted to this show
Danny aarons masterclass
If I was JJ I'd call the racist card out
Danny fucking up the bombing twice 😭😭
I was in absolute stitches when Lochlan was screaming for JJ to put a bomb down, but then accidentally blows up Lochy 😂😂😭😭💀💀
😂😂❤
If I got Danny, lachy or Ellum as an imposter teammate id just not play tbh
LOOOOL Deji at 9:13 is hilarious mannn hahahahahahahaha
Do more GTA races
Sabotage light and flick off the light until all the players have gathered in lights and plant the boom when everyone is at that place simple as that😅
For a second I thought JJ said, “Why is Simon putting sauce on me?” 😂😂
Why do you guys keep changing names and pictured of videos?
Am I the only one who was 100% sure that this video had a different name yesterday?
wow
Them adding a bomber role when Oppenheimer is released is another level of ester egg
ayo Sidemen, u should really try First Class Trouble, you'll have an absolute blast!
THEY CHANGED THE TITLE!
Where's the mod where they make Simon remotely entertaining to watch?
use me as a " we need more bomber roll" button
Maker moree videos
When golf with friends?
why josh always playing w his damn hat
I love sidemen among us best thing to exist after Selena Gomez
JJ killing Lachlan was peak😂
Where’s vik?
WWWWWWW KSI
I need the og sidemen among us don’t like deji or Danny Aaron on here! Get us Vik, behz, lux, freezy
The moment when JJ murdered Lachy instead of the crew mates have me in stitches 😂
Get Randy out bro 😭 he dosnt let the game play and just calls a meeting or throws the game at the end
I wish Danny Aarons has some sort of explanation for this because I can't keep watching Among Us videos if he's going to sound like a prepubescent fat kid. I am routing for Danny's downfall ever since this voice change!
23:40 i was dying when the bomb skipped all of them and killed lachlan 😭
Lannan obviously doesn’t read the comments lmao or he’d know nobody is complaining that he complains 😂
I was so shook at the end of JJ’s bomber round, JJ is so much better than he used to be at this game 😂 he came pretty close to playing Simon and Josh who are the two big brain crewmates.
love how lanen’s walls have more n more marks every episode from the monitor that gets abused all the time 😂
I think Randy might be closeted
No cap, sidemen videos have fallen off a bit but the among us videos are bangers
Day is funny but annoying asf aswell
Mayor role is useless
What the fuck is wrong with Danny Aarons voice?
Simon has been acting like a little bitch lately.
i fucking hate how danny talks
Rant probably the worst at this game
Anyone else wipe their screen when Lazar threw the monitor at the wall 🤣🤣🤣😭?
The hell is going on with Danny Aarons throat?
So cringe at how Tobi complains about JJ being predictable in among us when what he does is either play the victim card, says that someone is “stealing his story,” or brings real life shit into it (ex: if you don't vote, it's a yellow card). Starting to get old tbh
Sidemen among us is the greatest thing happened to the game
Lannan always being the first to die is so funny to me
tobi talking about jj being bait when he is imposter is so funny, being bait is still much better than crying and playing the victim card as imposter
We need a Vikkstar bomber masterclass
True sidemen fans knows that thumbnail is changed
The Sidemen are really keeping this game alive
32:53 Harry votes for himself 😂
Did the title change?
okay this role is sick, we gotta get a part 2
Take a shot everytime Toby makes a joke but then can't take one
good to see there still playing among us even though it kinda died that means they aint playing it for views .
KSI is starting to laugh like Scooby Doo
If gib played he would get the role every game
We want Among Us Chaos mode. Back me up guys
And danny hasn’t cleaned his throat yet
8:57 Danny being middle eastern suicide bomber😭😭
why does danny aarons sound like that
What's up with Danny's voice?
man these guys must have a total IQ of 10.
Tobi could leave as soon as the game starts and no one would notice
JJ doesn’t use the vents and it stresses me out
Randy has become the new ethan
The fact that Vik isn't in this video is really disappointing 💀
Why is no one talking about Danny’s   voice and why is it like that
Title has been changed
What is up with Danny arrons voice….. seriously though it’s getting annoying lol
23:31 the best content I have ever seen on YouTube 😂
1st game and last is almost the same except the results 😂
We need Lazar redemption arc
I think someone should rank the best sidemen among us players
Imagine if Gib was in this video. 💀
Sidemen  should a collab with angry ginge
You have a real talent for making people laugh 😂 Keep the funny videos coming!
28:20 guys new drinking game take a shot every time Tobi gets disappointed that he got imposter
Why more entertaining without vik
Why does DannyAarons sound like he is going through puberty again.
Sidemen among us the best
I always look forward to the among us videos 😂
Let's vote for folabi edition❤️
Bro facts
alternative title: WE PLAYED AS MUSLIMSS IN AMOUNG US
Why does danny arrons sound like that 💀
When the video's originally called: "SIDEMEN AMONG US BUT KSI HAS THE INFINITE IMPOSTER ROLE"
How many times u gonna change the title bro
I miss sidemen gta 😢
Jfc, Simon is on a speedrun on how to be the most vibe-killing annoying little twat in Sidemen videos it seems
Danny Aarons the 🐐
What’s wrong with Danny Aaron’s voice
😅😅
I swear jj can’t talk to his brother normally, always calling him dickhead after every sentence like he’s smarter or something( knowledge strength and integrity) more like knucklehead stupid and ignorant
I’m dying from KSI killing Lachlan
Guys whats this https://youtu.be/_8cml-yysPU
JJ's bomb skills are jokes 😂
Why does Danny sound like a mong
Danny is so unbearably stupid sometimes bro ong
45:16 COME ON DANNY! HELL YEAH! GET IN THERE LAD! U WENT FROM A RETARD TO AN ABSOLUTE GENIUS
Only 1 day and 2.7 mill views already
Vik should’ve been here
never stop making these
No way JJ actually learned how to play decently 💀💀💀
Danny Aarons for the comeback!
JJ’s oh shit always get me 🤣🤣🤣
These are my favourite type of videos to watch!
Sidemen plz play a game of among us but there's a twist There is chaos mode meaning all mods r there U don't use ur names like Tobi but instead u use pronoun names like her he   And question names like who or whom  And no skins should be applied   Plz and thank u
It sounds like Danny has tonsillitis
These videos are still entertaining to watch but how could it still be like “everyone is bad). It isn’t even a hard game plus they play for hours at a time so I just don’t get the fact that everyone still be dumb or doesn’t know how to play properly lol. I still love watching them but wish they would actually try a bit
What is up with that water bottle lol Jj
can people PLEASE know how to use their roles before playing, its frustrating to see them get roles and waste them for 30 minutes acting....unsmart
bring back dead by daylight pls
I’m certain that Danny Aron’s has an IQ of a rock
Yessss that last dub was peak! And jj bombing Lachlan was so goddamn funny
My favorite series ever
Editor is so good. These videos are actual films
Danny being shit scares me that he’s a real human, genuinely mind blowing how clueless he is
23:49 WHAT … THE FUCK!!!
23:35 This part had me dying🤣🤣
I love Lannon in these vids.  plz keep inviting him
the game for some reson dosent work and it dont want to let me enter a game soo any one know's why ??
Bomber role has to be the most interesting addition in a while. Hilarious video
This has to be the best sidemen among us video ever 😂😂😂😂😂
kinda deads the content when they always just vote out jj :/
Lazar is so fun to watch
Why Danny Aarons turn into meat wad the past two videos
Can we have a weekly sidemen among us
I would love to see more Lazar as imposter but he's right, he's usually crewmate.
Simons too sweaty and a tryhard
Danny Aarons voice was hard to listen too. bro is full of saliva
Tobi never been the imposter
If you don't care even why do you join simon xD
Dany sounds like he snorts an 8ball and never blows his nose
This is the funniest sidemen among us ever for sure
KSI ACCIDENTALLY KILLING LACHLAN WAS HILARIOUS
How did no one get on Simon for thinking that Tobi exploded himself even though JJ was right next to him and would’ve died too
Dam where vicstar
More sidemen among us with the Aussies and Danny - I miss pie too
IF THEY CALLED ELECTRICAL YK.....bomb
Tobi swears he never wants to be the imposter or deceive his friends, while Deji wants to be maniac that manipulates and massacres the entire lobby
Danny why are you not sabotaging 😭
How dumb can randy be?!
Seriously what is going on with Danny's voice?
Lazar as a fellow Aussie, your frustration is entirely justified. I don't even know why I waste my time watching these
I only watch these for the Beam Content!!!
23:41 *_HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH_*
Jj in the thumbnail and title? Editors know what they’re playing at today
I love how they didn’t include vik in this video where u can plant bombs 💣
Lazarbeamreads the comments love you lazarbuddy 🎉👏🔥
I agree with Harry "Fuck off Deji" Hope his run in these block recordings ends soon. Brings nothing to the games, he literally sat at the table sulking.
I have watched so many of these videos and Randy ALWAYS throw it! JUST ABSOLUTELY GETS EVERYTHING WRONG!! 😑😑😑
what has been up with Dannys voice
Hm Vikk Isn't In This Particular Video.....I Wonder Why
Let Lazar live alil longer than 5 minutes yeh
23:30
36:51
6:18 it happened again 😂😭
I will NEVER get tired of sidemen among us😭😭😭😭
Randy is so rubbish😂
We need more of this mod
Simon ruining the video again
If I was playing the first person I’d kill is Simon he is chatting so much 😂😂😂
Yo wtf Why is there a Illuminati symbol at 46:24
“Ayt now that he said said that I can kill Josh” is one of of these most cold and calculated things I’ve heard JJ say
We need sidemen prop hunt
PLEASE ADD ANGRY GINGE. He’s hilarious
I’m so glad deji was not the imposter once he is like the little brother forced to be dragged along and makes everything less fun I hope I never see him in another one of these videos his  laugh makes me want to die.
Why does Danny sound so nasal?
Why do I strongly dislike DannyAarons
I love Lazar 🤣🤣
JJ bombing Lachlan was so funny🤣
Every few videos I wonder why I haven’t subscribed so I subscribe but then I see jj at the end and remember 💀
Siemen got me through knockdown 🎉🎉
I love among us
Why’s simons posture make him look freezing lol
Idk how they spell impostor wrong in the title of every single video when it literally says it on screen every game😂
Anyone else notice chipfat put fangs in the your mum stinks segment because everyone thought fangs was simons mum a few years ago😂
Danny: "See you later boys" Also Danny: [stands there] [dies]
ditch the roles bring back proximity
Idek y I watch these vids anymore, the best part was when Danny was muted. They just annoying to me now unfortunately
Back here for my second watch
Comedy gold at 23:30- 24:00
If vik was there to get  bomber no one would be safe 😬
Ayoo this is by far the most critical thinking sidemen among us has had👏🏽
Bruh i felt so bad for jj 14:00🤣🤣🤣
God damn I lost my breath laughing at jj's bomb
Ngl love among us but Randy pisses me off
Thank god vikks not here
The one time JJ isn’t even sussed, he gets voted just because he was imposter before 😂
46:28 omg they used the lion of joshes mum LMAO brilliant
Did that fucking subhuman not understand how a blast radius works
We need a bomber chaos addition 😅❤
Lazar and lachy best editions
😂😂😂 danny blow him self 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There was no vik and ethan in the vid so does that mean they are potentially leaving the sidmen since ethan is married and has a kid and wants to focus looking after it and vik is engaged and could potentially have a kid and wants to focus looking after it and if this is the case its been a long pleasure for both of them unfortunately i am a bit sad since i cant see them in the next sidemen charity match
Why does Danny sound like that it’s annoying
Danny ‘if I’m being completely transparent’ Aarons
Who wins if they all stacked and the bomber killed everyone including himself and the other imposter who wins
Whats wrong with Danny's Voice??  Genuinely Jarring 😂
Does Danny have a voice changer on? He sounds like Lenny from of mice and men
Danny Aarons is actually massively stupid
The amount of times JJ has killed someone, been caught by Randolph and then said ‘aww shit’ could in itself make a video 😭
Finally a panny parons master class
These videos are so good man
Simon “we’ve added the bomber role, they can place c4 and bomb everyone” Me - why does Obama have c4
Danny’s first ever masterclass 👏
Don’t ever stop please we all love this
i always want these among us videos like crack😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why do they put spoilers at the beginning? There’s no point in watching the rest of the vid cuz the spoiler is the best part
Does Tobi know it’s just a game? Why does he get so butthurt lol
Deji is horrible at this game, runs in the family
They need to do proximity chat with deji/lazar/danny/lachlan
🗣️Where is Logic Vic⁉️ 🤣 he woukd have easily found the imposter with greatest explanation lolololololol
What’s going on with Danny’s voice??
Lazerbeam disaster class
one thing i love that i'll never get over, is the fact that they overlay reactions. like hearing danny's voice while on lachy's cam/pov. it's so good
Literally in tears after watching this 🤣
Drunk Sidemen Among US
DannyAarons crazy wthhhh he acc solo🤣
Call lights, mess with the buttons, when everyone is around drop the bomb
Nobody says it but Randy is the stupidest among all of them. Like bro hasn't ever had a good game. Even Danny has occasionally good games
Can we ban Danny from all among us videos until he stops speaking like Smeogul
Dejis laugh makes this so good
they should place bombs on the exits of rooms, should work waaay better than placing it where people are standing.
You should do a mod where the imposter role switches person to person each round
Has Danny got a frog in his throat the fuck is wrong with him
watching randy play among us is like listening to a fork scratching a plate
Lazarbeam too funny man 😂
Danny is hands down the worst imposter possible
Simon trying to control everyone makes it shit
23:30
0:21 “Alright we have OBAMA role”
More sidemen among us pls this is why I follow you
Bro, I sometimes hate how Simon ruins the vibes by calling everyone idiots and sweating so much, like man, chill, we watch for the vibes not for improving our Among Us kills
Lazar dying always in the beginning is dead man😂😂😂
Lannan is the only smart one along with Simon but Lannan just never gets to the end of rounds apart from the last 2 games😂
thank you. 46 minutes ofvthank you. and there wasnt a lot of weird rules, everyone was trying to win and being themselves. so fun to watch
What’s up with Danny’s voice
36:47
Sidemen Amongus just never gets old😂😂😂
I like Sidemen Among Us more than a majority of sidemen Sunday’s
I understand why vik wasn’t in this video 💀
Someone’s gotta keep tallies on who makes good and bad plays.  Randy has got to have the worst record of all time.
anny darrons cold makes his voice is so annoying in this video lmfaoooo
Randolph 🤡
I nerver
Poor lazar always gets killed first
Only people aloud to play this dead game
Take a shot everytime Danny Aaron’s says to be honest or to be completely transparent
Yes please the same kind of videos, longer the better
Danny got better
Sidemen among us is all I look forward to
this was better than the farm sidemen sunday
Toby next time join dead vc
There’s a reason vik isn’t here for this role
Bomb mod is hilarious
We need more of this
To bomb ppl just turn off lights make the bomb where the stack is
I love lazer😂
36:10-36:22 nah this was sooo funny from josh 😭
Pls Guys do some tasks haha
36:08 Little doggo🥹🫶
Haha best sidemen yet
30:07 LMAO
Simon is the only one with brain cells. Josh has become so awful at this game
a danny aarons masterclass?! WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE'D SEE THIS RARE DAY BOYS
Cant believe we got the ahh shit part 2 with Randy again
Lazar dying in the first round never gets old
Lannan, if you are reading this, I love your complains! Please continue 😀
Josh norway shirt is a classic now
Love this
The funniest thing Is that Aaron did an absolute masterclass gameplay at the end and even him doesn't know how he did it
jj was full vibes the entire video, feels like he’s being himself and we here for it
Danny pulled it out of the fire 😂😂🫡🫡
Plague Doctors during the Black Death: 18:20
All sdmn suck from simons
Love the vid! Missing good ole Behzinga throws🤣
MAKE MORE
Jesus is our saviour ✝
Free tobi man😂
6:56 LOL
Sidemen among us is the best content in youtube
The editor needs a raise for 40:05 😂
Thank god they removed JME
How do these guys not understand how to use sabotage correctly as imposters yet
JJ have the guiness world record for most times killed as an imposter
Why is no one deeping how stupid Randy is ?? He was with lazer the whole time that last round so it couldn’t have been either of them and he still votes lazer?? It literally had to be Danny ?? 😭😭 how did everyone overlook this?? Even lazer overlooked randys stupidity here 💀💀
JJ: I had to get rid of all the black people   Josh: And me 😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe having imposters be able to voice call would be cool
They should add forfeits if they are wrong, so everyone is less willing to chuck a random vote on!
Legend says that Bomber role was inspired by Arabs
Do tasks
Old map is goat map
lannan complimenting danny's cam kill is so wholesome considering how much they argue with each other
Every other sidemen among us justice for lazarbeam
Why is this their best content.
Man who tf complained about lazarbeam' complaining? I love watching him losing his mind every game, and drifting away from sanity.
Omg I love this videos I can’t get enough from among us
welcome back simon
Danny's voice is so annoying. Sounds like he's got something stuck in his throat and it's jarring to hear
Imagine vik was playing and he got the bommer💀💀
Editors spoiling the vid before it starts lol
The funniest among us sidemen moment ever man😭😂😂
36:35 - 38:03 Danny Got Em '
Rick and Morty S3 Ep6 3:30 sounds exactly like Danny Aaron’s
JJ blowing up Lachlan omg that was amazing 💀
KSI is the exact definition of NA education.
please don't stop making these kind of videos, it makes me laugh everytime I watch it. Thank you
what happened to danny's voice?
Imagine vik was playing and got bomber 😂😂😂😂
JJ and Deji are like Cain and Abel 😂
Who else is here just to watched Danny Arrons dog in the corner? 😂😍
Tobi always dead’s it
Danny talks like he’s doing the chubby bunny challenge
KSI needs to get a among us watch
The shortest sidemen amongus vid ever
thats so fun to watch!!
Always a pleasure watching Danny aarons play 😂😂😂
oppenheimer sidemen version
45:46 dannyyxjj masterklasss😤
Danny was great in this
We need a team thats only danny and jj on the main challenge 😂
Keep doing more among us it brings me so much joy
Has Danny Aarons got a pitch shift down slightly on his voice recently?
I was screaming for 4 minutes straight for Danny to sabotage, DANNY YOU ARE IMBECILIC MATE, I LOVE YOU LAD BUT YOU’RE THE WORST PLAYER OF ALL TIME
23:33 the IQ of JJ is 1000 and -1000  1000 for waiting so long when he could have  💣 immediately but no 😅 -1000 for delaying and killing his teammate
Lannan your amazing haha
Josh said 🙋🏿‍♂️
No way is Randy that fuckin dumb, him and Ehtan shared a single brain cell
wait couldn't they detonate the bomb if they just clicked it again
Wow Sidemen's clear, partnering with Oppenheimer and that
Danny Aaron’s elite imposter his kills are always premium😮‍💨
25:27 theres no was he doesn’t bomb man easiest win right here yu just need 2😮‍💨
Deji every round crewmate  is so boring
Shiii ahh i was  so close  to killing him 😂😂
I wanted that second JJ game so bad
Tobi crying per usual 😂😒
KSI laughs so much when he’s impostor, gives it away so easily.
I wonder if the sidemen know doing all crewmate tasks wins the game. Maybe it’s beyond them
9:13 FSE I swear yu lot😭
The hilarious bombing  9:13 Danny and jj 10:49 lacky dacky suicidal  23:48 jj bombed lacky dacky his own partner in crime 😆
Why is Simon putting sauce on me? - JJ
Finally, they put an Arabian character in among us
The only lobby where half the players can sit on cams and Danny Aaron’s isn’t smart enough to walk by and drop a bomb on it …
Ngl for Danny’s standards his win was insane
I wanna see lazer being imposter
Why did Deji call JJ ‘little big man’🤣
It’s actually crazy how fun among us is with these guys lol
Deji's laugh is so infectious 😂😂
for once jj is actually using his brain
Danny and Lazar fit in so well
JJ should jus be called SI after that first imposter round
I hope Lachlan and Lazer dont get so annoyed they leave 😭🤣 they make these videos hilarious to watch
We need shapeshifter
Missing vikkstar
Y is Harry ginger now
these segments are crazyyy 😂💀 38:26 "remixing liver king's apology" 💀
comments better be nice to Lannan he's a top guest.
more among us videos the better
Josh with the Norway shirt! Respekt🇳🇴
Why is Danny’s voice like that?
i hate danny aarons
36:24 we need to stop killing all the blacks... Then josh just going and me!
after a good basketball game i get to get home and watch this great game played by the greatest youtubers ever
deji is such a good add on to among us hahahahaha
im not overexaggerating when i say this, when KSI blew up Lachlan I LAUGHED SO HARD I LEGIT STARTED SEEING STARS IN MY VISION THAT WAS CRAY Z
Has danny got a cold or something
Deji’s laughter cracks me up😂
Watching all of these and seeing lazar slowly lose brain cells
i hate danny aarons
12:45 the fact that he does that everytime hes on a Sidemen Among us Video
“I think I’m gonna leave it there” -A real one ☝️
Randy plays so bad in every among us it triggers me,
Please play fall guys😭😭😭
Should increase the uploads of Among Us. Only good MoreSidemen videos
where’s vik🤣🤣🤣
Every time I think about sidemen among us I come on YouTube and it’s here
i think danny has down syndrome
I cant believe how 2 most brain dead won 😂😂
They should do this more without vik
that bomb at 28:50 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 JJ
I don't know if it's just me but I felt a little Sexual Tension between my favorite Australian and Simon
how can jj live with himself knowing he is that dumb
Bro sideman amoung is is so fun to watch
The illuminati at the outro 🧐
39:41 how has no one noticed that if Danny votes Lazar then he wins😅
24:42  "BLUD THINKS HE GOT A WATCH'' I paused it and read it 😂😂
"This is the biggest brain from me... I dont even know what I done" 😂😂 that's DannyAarons theme music 😂
Imagine Vick as the bomber he would win every round
How many monitors does Lazarbeam have 😂
There’s never enough sidemen among us
This video legit went full circle
Randy is so dumb.
This is the best sidemen content since like 2021
Bro that josh's mom lion pic is a violation
WHERE IS VIKSTAR
WHERE IS VIKSTAR
WHERE IS VIKSTAR
WHERE IS VIKSTAR
#We Miss VIK!
only Danny could play so badly in one game to demonstrate absolute masterclass in another lmao
Harry running around in a blindspot part of the map walking into a wall "any dead bodies" great detective 😂
I can't lie the lobby gets worse every vid but also funnier😂😂
Pls pls pls keep making these videos love them!!!
Never enjoy watching among us unless it’s sidemen
POV lazarbeam every amongs video:☠️😕
the editing on these videos is crazy
😂😂😂
The fact deji called jjs character (Jigglypuff) a pig lmaoooo
where is chip
Sidemen among us: Oppenheimer edition
11:39 that wasnt even a bit..  just voting JJ out for absolute no reason has got to stop, sometimes its good but yous seem to just do it out of habit if jj does anything at all
They stole this idea from a friend of mine  https://youtu.be/PfcN0UBYOfs
how can they so dumb to stand in the big bright red circle after placing a bomb
Randy man 😂😂
I love Tobi no cap, but in these videos he is such a child doesnt take a joke and just tries to be politically correct like man HAVE FUN!
Just from the intro I’m guess there is a bombing role, in which KSI and Danny are the impostors, Danny gets the bomb role and blows up both himself and KSI
Danny Arons freaking Master Class!
Lachlan dying from JJ's bomb killed me
Why ruin the thing that happens at the end by showing it at the start💀
Love the among us videos
Danny is a numpty
Any particular reason Vikk wasn’t included in this recording?….
Sidemen among us we need more!
Sup with Aaron's voice? 😂
Can someone explain what’s happened to Danny’s voice? Does he have a cold?
jj is like barbiehiemer
36:08 y'all bunch of african americans...plus Josh y'know cause we rocking with Josh😂
deji’s laugh is so contagious
Would have been ironic if Vik was here and impostor, and got the boomer role😂
With simon and vik together this lobby could be more smart and not through more
i love lachlan he a good lad
how do you even mod this stuff?
Just a humble suggestion but turn off the bomber role when vikk comes back , no specific reason just turn it off then 🤐💀
100% Lachy’s fault for running the same way JJ went 😂
I think Danny is wearing Invisalign 🩵
Oppenheimer would not be proud of these bombings
Brother killing brother. What has the world come to?
danny needs to sit out of among us vids😒
Simon was bare trash this round
randy just overthinks like he is einstein
I LOVE SIDEMEN AMONG US
NEVER STOP MAKING AMONG US, i’m 22 from aus and i still love these videos
Randolph is the one of the worst players I've seen, he's left at the end because he's so silly at making decisions
Danny is so stupid every episode
JJ killing his teammate with the bomb was hilarious
nobody understands my excitment when i see lazar in these videos
Sidemen among us is the only series I will carry on watching till I’m 50
14:49
27:23 i thought i had matured over the years 😂😂
yo danny u know u can sabotage right
the fact that Danny didn't sabotage and kept missing bombs near the end, but still manages to win is legendary
Bro randy genuinely can't do anything without simon😂
Being as dumb as Randolph, is a feat in itself 🤯
I'm just going to place a like for  lazar's rage
wtf is dejis laugh
i watch thes efor danny and danny only
Lachlan blowing himself up after the previous round was so stupid…
Zerka black
Good thing Vik wasn't here 😮😮 jokes would've been maad
Danny could only be the one stupid enough to read the description about his role and forget blow up himself and jj
BRO Danny fr makes my brain hurt all he had to do was voteout lazaar but he said he should keep em alive AND skipped, bro sold the bag so hard
Simons being such a dick
Vik just vented irl
We need GTA with the same people
Is someone gonna tell them the code is messed up lol💀 that’s why imposter is only being given to like 4 of the same ppl
Do bomber and shapeshifter
So we are just gonna ignore the fact that jj said you little pink man killl me instead of jiggly puff XD
Please never stop making these videos, these are truly the best videos for straight entertainment on youtube right now
46:22 That sign 🔽
Poor Tobi
KSI running around as a smiling Jigglypuff will always be the funniest thing to me XD
fr
37:55 danny so happy that things accidentally go his way 😂
What’s happened Danny’s voice?
Well at least this makes up for them always killing JJ early or voting him out early for no reason. Was nice to see him get some airtime.
Danny's voice is so annoying man. Just cough!!!
Wtf lmao ksi bomb. Clipped gee was jokes
the best among us episode
W DANNY
lazer beam W
Finally sidemen understood how to use KSI for views
Make Lazarbeam a permanent sidemen member
that emergency button is to much would be better play until
Angryginge for sidemen among us??????
Danny is such a dumb player😂
Lachlan: JJ's got the bomb not good Also Lachlan: Blew himself up with the first bomb he used
Danny Arron’s so annoying man
Need more 😂deji and ksi
simon Trading
Mayor is useless, just make the crewmate feel better :)
Been really ill with tonsillitis almost had sepsis this is just what I needed to cheer me up thanks a lot
Bro lazar is a legend😂
Sidemen among us made lazar also one of them Dumbs😂
Man I was hopeing that vikk was the bomber😅😅
KSI AND DEJI 🤣🤣
lazar always dies first, new harry
I swear harry is the smartest. He always uses words big words so randomly and it shocks me everytime 😂
33:36 CANT BELIEVE JJ DID THAT TO LACHLAN🤣
We want moreeee
Deji's laugh😭😭😂😂
Danny amazes me every game. He just keeps getting dumber and dumber
"i dunno what i've done but it's good" gotta love danny
The fact that TOBI called KSI a kid is brazy!
Lazer saying he reads the comments about complaining... bro, you're always one of the best additions to the lobby lol
Bro I don't know why danny sounds so weird its making my head go crazy.
Josh always levels up his disasterclass
One of the best sidemen among us vids of all time. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit it this
👁
Can't put my finger on it but there's a reason Vik isnt in this session...
danny is such a neek stop having him in videos man. so annoying.
JJ killing Lachlan 😂😂
Ngl the “let’s all get on a stack” call would be funny af with this role.
Danny is a simple man.....
34:14 😂 Harry is a different breed
20:34- Harry Lewis with the Auto Tune. Singing like T-pain on this clip here. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is our third imposter man😔
32:43 😂 Jj Spamming the Imposter role
30:42 😂 KSI glitching
😂😂😂randy got the throw of the century
What happened to Danny’s voice
Deji predicting Harry being on cams is hilarious 😂
im so glad they vote simon out that slendy slander sex offdnere is so sannoying ahhaha
Ironic how this video is about suicide bombers and vik isn't in the video
This video is in honour of Oppenheimer 🫡
Sidemen should play the airship map
And then ya'll continue to wonder why we still watch these videos. Best content ever!!!
it was one the best sidemen among us episods
Unpopular opinion but they should try to get on Logan Paul in sidemen among us that’ll be jokes 😂
seeing how the bombers have the easiest settup by doing any and all sabotages and yet doesnt use any of them is hilarious
That edit on Danny already tells me that this will be a good vid
Lazar Danny Randy makes it so good 😂
Lachlan: "I'm staying away from JJ with the bomb, this can never be good"  JJ proceeds to kill lachlan with the bomb.
12:54 😂Danny is just mad sus
JJ Vs Simon and Josh is the decider was elite.
Make a 1 hour vid pleasee, this
I WANT MOREEEEE....I LOVE THESE VIDS, PLEASE SIDEMEN , DONT STOP MAKING THESE VIDS, LOVE EM❤
This video is the GOAT of all time. Peak.
danny is so annoying he ruins sidemen videos
Danny deserves it, the sus on him for no reason, just because it's him, and he still made it where he did, deserved
Surely it can’t just be me who can hear Danny’s voice sounds weird😂😂
4:55 oh he said BOMB right ok i thought he said… nvm
JJ saying "he's pretending to do tasks", knowing very well he's an imposter is classic
danny’s dog cuddling it’s toy is my favorite subplot ever
Lazaaar dies on first everytime
Among us from sidemen are the best 😊
Where JJ kills Loc 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man I love this game
Can you guys play Outlast Trials?😂
Never stop among us plz
At this very hr it's #1 trend gaming vid on tubez
Best part I'm. Staying away from jj because hes got the bomb then gets blown up 😂😂
Please a video without Danny his voice is honestly so annoying 😩
When JJ's bomb killed Lachlan I lost it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the way i laughed out loud at JJ killing Lachlan was unparalleled 😂😂😂
Bomber just go electrical with lights off and plant it easy sun
How is Randy that dumb 🤦‍♂️😂
Harry singing Heaven is a place on earth is my favourite moment 😂
Ksi killing lachlan who was the other imposter proves how dumb ksi is
What’s with Danny Aaron’s voice
couldn’t stop fuckin laughin at jj’s impostor skills 💀
11:38
Danny just cant have more than 10 iq im afraid, i wonder whats going on inside his head most of the time💀
How is Randy so stupid?
how hard is it to call lights and drop the bomb there oh my god
“I wanna bomb someone right now.”-> Danny Aarons 2023
Play more on the skeld please
Unreal danny masterclass
Lannan’s predictions are scarily accurate 😂
The editing in this video is perfection 👌😂
The Bomber should sabotage lights, mess with the lights, and then while everyone tries to fix lights just place the bomb and take cover 🤣🤷🏽‍♂️ at least 3+ kills right there
Lannan starts speaking and hes in the right direction but then someone always butts in LOL let him speak😂
The last vote by Randy is ridiculously stupid 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️.. like you'd think by now some of them would know how to play
please dont stop with this series, its hilarious 😂 also let Tobi lives man 🤣🤣
JFC this is the funniest video ever
How many monitors does lannan have lmao
The only time this game is fun to watch 😅
Why don't the bombers call sabotages and then use bomb?!?!
I'm sorry boys, I have done all I can to repress this but Randy needs to stop playing Among Us mann
HELP!!!! Why does Deji’s laugh sound like a Disney bully 😂😂😂😂😂
Nah jj missing everyone and killing Lachlan at 23:42 had me laughing tbf🤣
Just me or is Toby annoying
Interesting how vik isnt in this video
23:30 😂😂😂this is the funniest bomb i've seen since Four Lions
Simon seemed to had it this video 😭
Is Danny ill? Cause it sounds like bro needs to bring up that obscene amount of phlegm he has sittin in his throat at the minute lmao
o
the probability of jj getting imposter 6 times is 0.00006% chance mental
Miss vikkk
Why does Danny sound like that?
Over 46 minutes of brain cancer🔥 lessgo 🔥🔥
Danny Aaron’s sounds like he’s got a quinsy
So is Josh the Honorary Black Sideman??
Did anyone else think the marks on Lannans wall was on they’re phone and try to wipe it off 🤦‍♂️
3:58 ayeee go Josh go!
why play with deji when all he does is complain about not being imposter 😪 mid ass crewmate
Randolph being the 3rd imposter as usual.
“I wanna bomb someone , I’d give it a buck fifty “ - Danny Aarons 2023
Randolf is a bit slow
60FPS my ass
11:59 jj is like, come on harry, i know that but just don't say it directly. thanksfor saving btw
I love sidemen among us istg I’ve rewatched every video more than 15 times
we want vik
They need to do these imposter vids with Simon coz he’s to boring in them
Scratches behind LazerBeam ,mirrors his mental status playing Among Us with the sidemen.
Lannan is so funny
23:38 im dead 😂💀💀
I hate how the “dead” people talk before the Victory or Defeat screen pops up. It takes away from the satisfaction.
Tobi making fun of jj for saying the same thing over and over again is the most hypocritical statement ive ever heard😂
Ksi: Honestly had to get all the blacks out Deji: I just realized ye you got rid of all the black people Tobi: oh can we stop repeating it guys Josh: and me  😂😂😂😂
Love being stoned and having pan dulce to watch sidemen
If all of u change the names to him,me,I,you I think it will be madness in this lobby
Right admit it  Who else thought they said ‘bummer role’
The fact that they keep changing the mods for each game makes it extremely fun to watch despite the game outliving itself.
Danny aarons the influence of Marcus Rashford😂😂😂😂😂
No Randolph pls he so dumb
Am i the only that thinks lazarbeam destroying his computer because he got killed first is a bit of an overreaction
i think i speak for everyone when i say deji and lannan are a huge upgrade on viz and ellum
I never watch gaming videos except for sidemen among us videos I NEVER miss it
Its way to funny when jj is imposter
Sidemen among us is Unrivalled
Please don't call randi from next time
Hey Lannon, you are sexy and funny. don't listen to other comments. you do you
Randy is bigger thrower than ethan
yo, that water  bottle is fatter than ksi's mum's ass
Man like Lannan is always right
Every sidemen among us video is unique content, no matter what, it never gets boring 😂
should've gotten gib for this episode
Why isn't Vikk in this game🤨🤨📸
4:55
don't subscribe just so i can yell back at JJ
Lannan makes this so funny haha he’s way smarter than everyone which ends up hurting him in a lobby full of bots😂
the irony of danny calling people stupid and then he blows himself up.
Without Vikk & Simon the IQ falls off dramatically! 😂😂😂
23:44 🤣
Man give a raise to the editor he deserves it.
nah when jj killed his own teammate that shit was funny asf bro LMFAOOOO
Tobi yet again being a cry merchant 🤣🤣🤣
If lazar is actually reading comments hope he sees this… his complaining/bold takes make it very fun to watch, i don’t care if people think the complaining is annoying it makes it better for when he’s killed or guesses the wrong imposter
Deji trashing cams and saying "how is this fun!" Then Harry being right there waiting for cams was hilarious 😂
This YT video is epic but it misses Ethan
Greatest Among us gameplay of all time😂😂
Tobi said19 years and I’m still shocked… even though I know she they met🤣
23:30 might actually be the funniest thing i’ve seen😂 gives of 4 lions vibes
Sidemen among us never dies
#JUSTICEFORLAZAR
What is wrong with Danny’s voice
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😡
jj in every among us is a W 🤣
Mm M
Mm
Mm
Mm
Lazar dying in the first 3 minutes killed me.
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm

Mm
23:11  Tobi:how many times are we gonna give this kid impostor
Mm
Mm
Oh
What’s up the Danny Aaron’s voice?
“Danothy Aarons” 😭😂
these lot have negative iq
Danny masterclass
recent sidemen amon gus is not that great tbh
‘I can’t be a suicide bomber if I’m alive’ - Miniminter
Honestly though, why won't they use their ability if they're mayor??
Best way to use the bomb is plant it in front of lights and turn off the lights
31:28 jj gets work done when he doesn't use his brain. That's y he successful👑
36:10  JJ: "Honestly, I had to get all the blacks out" 🥷 Deji and Tobi: "🗿" Josh: "And me" 🤗 😂😂😂
25:30 Lazar saying he was wrong then finding it was him 😂
EVERYONE!! Close your eyes at 40:36 and JJs laugh sounds 100% like Scooby Doo lmao
One of the best sdmn among us
23:30 best❤
42:59 the confusion 😂😂😂
Josh is gonna be the idiot watch
i will say , Deji is a magnificent addition to these lobbies
I love Danny... but my man talks as if he needs an epi pen
"How many times are we gonna give this kid imposter?!" Tobi after he got killed by JJ
Deji is un ironically the best sideman
😂
The two lowest IQ players as imposters is JOKES LOL Danny and JJ with a bomber role with neither of them using the bomb well was so funny.
Deji and Jjs laughs just make everything so much funnier 🤣🤣🤣
plis keep doing this this is infinite money glitch and plis keep dedji so funny
Lazarbeam is literally always the first to get fucking killed like bro🤣
40:06 even before that intro, chills. Literal chills.
Plant bomb at lights call lights
Man Danny aarons and Randolph are dumb af
KSI thinks we think hes dumb but he's legit OG hhahahahaha
That Fabrizio romano bit was crazyyy 0:47
We can actually see Lazar's slow descent into madness the more he plays Among us with the Sidemen
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
I swear the scratches on Lannon’s wall were hairs and I kept trying to pick them off 😂
Video idea: Sidemen Among us but the imposters can speak to each other
Bro I know its wrong but u guys sure giving danny bomber wasn't planned🤣
Would've been so funny if Danny called lights then put the bomb
You know it’s gonna be a good day when the sidemen upload a 40 min plus AMONGUS VIDEO!!
Danny clutched up in the end there, that cams kill and him not voting lannan to make it more interesting and convincing everyone he wasnt the killer was insane
Funny how vik wasn’t in this one
Duck duck goose please
37:04
I love Lachy
Thank you Sidemen for always being amazing and your video's really help me through my break up i just had so thank you so much 😁😁
Ngl, missed Vikstar123 in this one. I want them to get a huge lobby, chaos mode. 20 people
Laser beam doesn’t even most on his YouTube no more, just sad
More please
To the editor: Just saying, dont be doin that bruv. The comments in the next vid gon be saying 'Why is KSI flexing his Rolex?'
More?!😂
I cant stand it. How can danny aarons be this fucking stupid. It literally says on screen what the role does and how to use the bomb.
I feel so bad for lazar
what the hell’s going on with danny aarons voice?
13:11 His personality’s growing on me
Dany arrons is so fkking stupid
Why does Danny sound like he has a frog stuck in his throat
*12:53** ah clasicc 🤌🏻🎩*
Lazar still has that wall crack
Randolph comsistently proves that he is low kq
What kinda among us do these guys play? How are there so many roles??
Where is @vikkstar123 ?
Wtf is going on with Donny Avian’s voice???
Imagine vik as bomber
danny the only bomber master class, if you can predict where everyone will go that could be such a good play.
The mark on lazars wall had me thinking my phone was dirty
FUCKING MASTERCLASS
12:29 I like how everyone was breaking things down and all of a sudden, they voted out Danny, such a Sidemen lobby to do 😂
11:53       14:26    15:05     23:30!!    25:04    27:20     28:10    36:07     37:46
I miss lazarbeam. He needs to upload
This is probably up there with the Top 5 Among Us videos they've done. The sequence of events, the confusion behind every player, just everything is so fun to watch
15:50 love the reference
I loved that the only time KSI has ever put ANY thought into any decision while playing among us was just to spite his brother at 20:20 😂
Am I the only one that doesn’t want deji in these videos?
W Lannon
BRUH I LOVE THEIR BOND HEHE... HOPE THEY WILL BE FRIENDS TILL THEY'RE OLD HEHE...
Danny was a bomber that last round and didn’t think to sabotage once to make them stand still, instead decided to use it while they were on the move 😂 idk how randy choked that when it was not possible for lazar to kill that unless he killed and instantly reported which was the unlikely scenario of the 2
😂❤️
Everytime I get bored I think, oh shit maybe a new sidemen among us. Today was a good day.
20:37 Harry caught me off guard
Weekly upload of sidemen among us please
I don’t even like playing this game on my own anymore, but I enjoy these videos so much. Never want them to stop lol
nah bro put harrys mum at the end
Broo now do this over again with the roles mixed a bit more !!!
I will never not watch these
Please don’t invite danny aarons idk who this guy is and when he started appearing but he’s so annoying and cringe and just something about him he’s just unlikeable and sounds annoying and even tries to hard, I don’t even understand why he was at the sidemen charity match, am i the only one who thinks this for people who agree with me let me know because I don’t see enough hate on him which is confusing is it only a me thing
JJ was doing so good at the beginning lol
Fckn L Danny 😂
Poor Danny getting voted out 😂
Do it again 😂😂😂😂
I just remembered, does more sidemen vids get demonetized due to Lazar?
Watching lannan in among us is like harry and gta
Simon just literally votes out random ppl but no one votes him out when he is the most cunning.
i dont understand how this game has existed for 4 years, harry has played it for 3; and he still has no clue what he is doing
we need prox chat mod back
Tobi edit scared the shit outa me @16.25 .. damn. *Editor here's my money, you need a raise.
i thought Simon said "Obama role we can lay c4" and i just laughed my ass off shouts to Obama
Is it just me or is Danny’s voice just fucked?
"I dare you little big man" now that's a new one 🤣🤣🤣
why does danny sound different 😭
Bro Danny sabotage comms then bobmmmmmm
Tobi gotta lighten up man, always gets so offended all the time haha
Randy should be killed right from the getgo in among us, I have never seen someone being this unreliable in sidemen among us, he threw the easiest game.
Josh is just having pure fun while being stupid !
NEED NOT 1 HOUR BUT 10
18:55 naa i actually i died 😂
This is such a clickbait title, I haven't even watched it yet and I'm excited.
this lobby is on fire the only one missing is vik bigbrain gameplay
7:52 ksi's laugh...
We need jj and deji as the imposter
Absolute banger video
I doubt TV ever can compete with this level of entertainment.
So good to have an among us breakfast here in Sweden 🇸🇪
This one was definitely the funniest one
The year is 2045. The sidemen realised another among us video. Me: LESSGOOOOO!!!!!!
Lannan investing in a monitor to be yeeted on the wall is so jokes. Thats a content creator right there. 😂
When did deji become KIRMADA?!!?
Please keep the bomber role for next time. It's the best mod in a long while. JJ blowing up Lachlan was priceless 😂
I love them
46:24 Josh’s mom making another appearance in the sidemen is wholesome af
justice for lazar
Randy is there for to cover the Ethan's part of the game
Dejis laugh kills me man lmao
36:18  "and me." 😂😂
Randy playing like lil bic
This Video has to be like Top 10 Sidemen Among Us Videos
Danny should really take out that retainer to film 😂😂
This video is gold only thing  missing is a big Ethan throw
Is it just me or is there a problem with Danny’s mic?
Honestly nobody wants you whining in these videos anyway so dont bother showing up tobi
where vick
Randy stinks
KEEP DEJI
HArry in Autotune is Noice
46:30 peep Josh's mum 😂
❤
Can't believe they played this mode without vikk
whats up with danny's voice
Danny Aarons and the influence of Marcus Rashford would make a great movie
Josh's "and me" @ 36:19 was perfectly timed
My god, impostor or not, it's like Simon is just hard cleared from start to finish in this game 🤣
7:16 randy was bang on
Hahhahahahahha Jj bombing Lachlan 😂
We miss Vik 😢
you should turn off the lights, then everyone will gather at electrical for lights and thats when you BOMB
What’s up with the phlegm in Danny’s throat the last few vids he sounds like he needs to clear his throat constantly it’s gross
28:13 thought there was a fly irl💀
Idk why but Sidemen among us is so so good I can’t bring my self to watch anyone else play among us but I can when it’s sidemen
Lazar is legit the best! 😂🎉
I would ask what’s Simon and Randolph’s headsets are, but I know I can’t afford them; so I won’t.
40:35 JJ sounds like Scooby-Doo
6:18 An another Deja Vu moment from Randy catching KSI LMAO
These are my favorite 😂
We need a beta squad sidemen among us
20:54 "Oh you bastaad 😡"
#moskater
Danny please for the love of god clear your throat blow your nose do something mate
20:35 lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Randy with yet another masterclass on how to be the worst crew mate in among us 😂
I love that Deji, in like the 4th episode he’s been in, just realized what a mayors powers are when he became one
Randolph might be the worst AU player out of the bunch
Lazar putting his feet up accepting defeat is fantastic
I  feel so sad for Lanan's credit card. LMAO
16:57 perfect transition
LMAOOOO 23:30 is absolutely hilarious
gotta love deji's temper tantrum every time he gets crewmate
https://youtu.be/ifc0Je5OnZE
Replace Danny annoy
danny pisses me off kick him offf he add nothing except a headache
Vik shouldve been the bomber man
The mark is still on the wall from the original clip of him throwing monitor 😂
Danny’s dog is so cute
Ayyo deji'z random guesses are smart bro 😮😮
Cinema gold is what the moment jj killed lacklan
Keep complaining Lazer lmao, I love what you bring to these videos
40:02 Danny Anrons and the influence of marcus rashford
40:34 jj got the scooby doo laugh 😂
Make moreeeee
How did every sidmen make a better diss track then ksi and he supposedly a rapper lmao ....ksi ik u won't reply to this but just know all the sidmen ruin your rap carrier with there diss tracks you can not rap
Lazar has to be minted, he's throwing monitors around in a cost of living crisis
Lannon rage had me deadddd off the bat 😭😂😂😂😂😂
If only vikk got the bomber role....
👍
this was the moment where DannyisDahBomb
danny sounds like meatwad
Love Deji in these
Does Danny have a cold or a thumb in his throat? Lad sounds like he’s in witness protection 😂
Jokes Aside JJ played imposter so calm, mad proud of him for it
Sidemen Among Us is officially the greatest thing ever, elite
watcking this drunk and high is so fun rn
28:14 the f**king flies got me soo bad smh
simon voting 4 lazar was funny
I love sidemen Among Us so much 😭
Can we just appreciate how much effort they put inside of me🥜😩😩
The second I saw this video I was like “YESS LETS GOOO SIDEMEN AMONG US FUCK YEAAAA
Lannan is so jokes his angry is so funny and amazing 😂
Didn’t know there were Muslims in the sidemen
Lachlan getting killed by Deji bc of the bomb for the 2nd time is FUNNY ASF 😭😭😭
when a sidemen among us is uploaded you know its a good day
36:01
Josh “and me” 😂😂😂😂 had me dying
AnnyDarons puppy is adorable!!
Jj killing lachy was the funniest shit everrr
Jj killing lachy will forever be top tier 😂😂
39:00 “Cause it was him or it was you…but I don’t remember you coming in there so fuk him”🤣
Notice how at the end Simons is still calling everyone dumb for getting it wrong yet right before he was killed he said it was the wrong person. He should keep quiet
27:23 💨
Why is Danny always level 1?
1.2 million views in 9 hours thats crazy
why does danny sound like he has something shoved in his throat
Love watching these among us videos while I Eat
23:40 😂😂😂😂
Bro the terrorist mod.
Lannan keep complaining 😁❤️
i can watch these for hourssssss
20:34
Havent seen jj really laugh for a long time until now
Terrorist mod fr
Tobi so jarring in this, crying about everything
danny masterclass
AnnyDarons Create memories in the lobby
So basically in that last game they voted jj of for no logical reason... again
the thing about JJ is if he were to play the “idk how to vent card” he’d get laughed at, ridiculed and voted out. BUT HE GENUINELY DOESN’T KNOW HOW TO VENT 😭😭😭 bro never vents 💀
34:19 ksi says “lets do lights” and shuts the door to electric instead
lazarbeam is growing good here
These are my favourite type of videos to watch!
Lazar I love seeing you in these videos. You add to the mix. Wouldn't be the same without you. 🤟
Man Deji is so underrated, love the laugh. 😂
Tf is wrong with Danny’s throat😂
"What is the worst suicide bombing you think you could pull of" thats gotta be the source of this video
"Anny Daarons" - Randolphin 2023
JJ's evolution as an impostor is unreal. Danny played so flawlessly that he is definitely top 3 impostors for sure.
Hello Lazar reading the comment, I enjoy you being in the recordings even with how frustrating they can be, have a great day
Question, why does Danny sound like that, like he constantly has a bubble in his throat
typical danny move
This shit was so funny
LET'S GO DREAM TEAM
Bombing role without vik 😂
Danny your dog looks so chill sleeping in the back
It’s always randy or pie selling🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
anybody else notice? if they just double click the bomb will detonate right then lol
Lannan really fucked up his walls for Among Us. It's easily paintable but damn.
Fair to say Danny is the new Behzinga
Randy is one of the most dumbest person in sidemen xD
"Everytime I just see that fucking pink furby stab me" 😂
Why is Tobi getting vexed and threatening to leave like go then you don’t do anything when you’re imposter you just throw and you don’t do anything as crew mate it’s funnier when you die
danny: kills himself with bomb lachlan the next round: *blows himself up* “WHAT WHAT”
22:53 why is Simon putting sauce on me?
How did Danny not clear his throat for two entire videos?😂
Thought i was gonna have to wait 2 weeks
I would use the suicide bomb when everyone runs to card swipe 😂
I’ve never seen ksi I this masterclass
WE LOVE SIDEMEN AMONG US 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
That is the biggest amoung us bomber fail I've ever seen lmfao 😂 only Danny
.
8:44 I don’t think I’ve ever seen JJ laugh like this
Is this the only sidemen among us with 5 games in it?
I’m happy that they are all dumb because it makes it more entertaining but sometimes it is frustrating as Danny could easy call reactor to to get randy and lazar away from Simon body or he could have call lights to drop a bomb for a better chance of 2 kills.
Randy and Danny are the two most frustrating people to watch. They share a brain cell
Danny and jj dieing together is class 😂
Randolph gotta be the dumbest player on this lobby😂
not dej playing in the kitchen💀
No one: Literally no one: I don’t know why your still reading it’s no one:   Simon: so we should vote out JJ
“Mum I’ve just signed for a Premier League club on £300k a week!” “Who gives a shit?”
whys danny sound like that
Best among us vid ever ngl
One of the best Sidemen AmoungUs 😂😂
Anybody else miss Behzinga
bro why does deji laugh as if he is coughing everytime
Gotta say Lazarbeam is my fav rn. He is so funny and he is just so good person to be in a among us.
I want Lazarbeam and KSI to get imposter again
Deji's laugh kills me
Randy is easily the dumbest one in all of these videos. No clue why people always try to take the heat off him. 😂😂
9:16, just like when deji would get destroyed when he and JJ played fifa back in the day
Randy never fails to throw the game 🤣
23:38 best moment
Harry's scream reminds me of Kevin from Home Alone😂
23:15 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need behz back in these lobbies
16:36 Boys! JJ has been Obama all along, Caught in 4K.
Dammn your mother stinks really 😭😭😂😂
Wow the only game with a bomb doesn't have vik in it. Y'all racists
What happen if there are 3 people alive and the bomber get a 3 kill streak with suicide🤔
Woomate
45:00 randy I don’t even somewhat care what you say about me because you ride jj and simons nut hairs but delete the game kid
bro didn't sabotage
Im with jj 😂😂😂 “ you kiss dogs “ 😂😂😂 I love and have dogs but I would never let them lick my face 😂📸
there was like one competent bomb kill in this whole 45min video lmao
25:30 Lazar is a king, actually was right but apologised immediately when he thought he was wrong
Danny is him
Lannon has joined the dark side and JJ is a great imposter
Never disappoints
Danny: “you can’t just do that” Lazar Beam: Oh really…..
38:22 yep. Of course trying to be like Simon and call someone out or spit out some theory. Thick wannabe Simon
''Getting quiet defence for suicide bomber'' 😂
they need to replace danny
Deji being a regular in these is my spirit animal.
So many ADs
23:28 funniest sidemen among us moment
Reaction when you realize that the video is over: from 😂 to 🥲
Average 30 year old gameplay
12:17 😂
Danny you idiot lol
JJ killing lachy got me buggin
10:51 I’m guessing he didn’t listen to Danny then 😂😂
The tension, the suspense, the comedy, this is peak entertainment from the sidemen
30:52 of course he apologizes to Simon. Get him outta your mouth bruv and get your teeth fixed 😂
Lemme smoke a fatty and watch this way too high
I haven’t liked among us more
This is the best! MY KSI
30:08 another example of the K in KSI being silent
THIS IS WHAT WE ALL WANTED!!!
26:49 randy stfu. Wanna be Simon so bad 😂😂😂😂
I watch these to see how much more fucked up Lazars room is from playing in these among us videos 😭
I'm so glad ellum isn't in the latest among us vids cuz he so fucking annoying
JJ got most of the rounds
Is it just me or did lazar looked like a sociopath in the end when he was talking at the camera with red eyes 😂
Danny ruins these videos
Ok beside the among us WHY IS DEJI IN HIS MUMS KITCHEN 😂😂😂
who doesn’t love having a meal well watching sdmn among us
3:12 😂
They bought down lazar to their stupidity and beat him with experience 😂
Love these videos
I wonder why vickstar123 isn’t in this 🤨
1 mil people clicked on a video of middle aged men playing a video game within 7 hours
34:15 bro dodged in real life 😭😭😭
23:41💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
why does Danny sound like that
JJ bombing Lachlan has been added to the among us moments montage LMAO never a dull imposter round with him
Man I absolutely love Lannan! 😂😂
Boys, you can’t be having more than half the lobby as crewmates… played with enough roles for everyone to have one, up the % to 100,  2 imps, 1 neutral, sheriff, mayor, engineer, jester, medic, exe… gives something for everyone to have fun with
The world needs and deserves a Lannan and Harry imposter round
JJ and Randolph competing for the most stupid sidemen member
USE THE FUCKING SABOTAGE
sidemen among us is like fucking crack, i'm forced to watch it instead of doing my work
JJ hunting Deji for the sake of it is fucking hilarious
Yeaaaaa keep em coming
Mate that’s not c4 lol 😂
Toby saying power with red eyes XD
A nice compliment from LazarBeam at the end there.
These videos literally are THE best 😂😂
@yanal you are the suicide bomber here not them
Danny might be the worst person at this game he just waffles on and acts likes hes the best player in the lobby
11:54  HAHAHA
editor, that ending was FOUL
Do we ever figure out why Danny Aarons voice sounds so fucking weird?
Of course the guy with the annoying voice has the most to say.😂
MOST THROWS BUT THERES NO ETHAN NO WAY. MISS VICK AS WELL
9:21 🤣
@23:40 nahhhhhh lmao
is it just me or is is lazerbeam annoying in these videos, he's tryingt too hard to be edgy and complain i just groan when he's on screen
Can we get an Anny Darrons dog cam tho ????!
Keep Deji on the game fellas! 👍
how can danny not kill anyone with this first bomb xD
These would have to some of the most enjoyable videos on YouTube ever, keep up the awesome work.  Among Us, GTA and Sunday Challenges are goat.
Danny’s dog🥰
so close to 8 millly
First round was pure stupid lads why not make sabotage coms or something and bomb everyone there easy gg like 💀🤡 n he claims he didn’t know could blow yourself up, uhh most games have that realism. 💀💀🤡 I don’t know a game where I can blow myself or anything, n so carry on as I’d like the bomb didn’t effect me, not check point restart or someshit, pure dumb these are getting worse n worse we here to see the big plays, not how dumb one is n laugh like after a few videos get repeatative n boring, not even interesting to watch this video
sidemen among us will never be not a good video
DAILY SIDEMEN AMONG US PETITITION!!!!!
i swear randy is the dumbest out of this lobby even more than jj... unbelievable
Danny's voice in the past 2 among us videos has been so god damn horrible it's almost unwatchable... wtf is going on
Where is vik bro
I can never get enought of sidemen among us
Bruh i hate when they intro a video with a spoiler, like wtf
Lachy is sneaky dumbest person in this lobby
Lazerbeam reads the comments? Lazer we all love you. Never leave these videos please! 31:20
Love deji among us
Anyone else find Danny's voice unbearable?
Danny has officially proven he’s the worst player in the history of the game🤦‍♂️
Simon has a bad attitude
Lazar is always fun in sidemen among us, best guest (it’s more like permanent role now love it😂)
I wait for these more than sidemen Sundays now 😂
23:40 NO WAY 😂😂😂
Randolph the Fraudulent Investigation Unit
JJ’s bom killing lachy got me dead bro😂😂😂
Danny should've planted the bomb in the entry of electrical he could've killed randy & lannan
Wonder why vik isn’t in this video 😂
“Danny aarons and the influence of marcus Rashford” 😂😂😂😂
This has to be one of the best sidemen among us ever
Pure Entertainment Love the among us vids 😂😂😂
you should make a video where everyone is the imposter
You know it's a scuffed session when two games already happened in 1/3 of the video.
28:17  drunk among us would be so funny
Danny arons voice is mad anoying
Great vid but icl if Tobi clearly doesn’t wanna be there it’s not great for the content
This be more entertaining than the recent sidemen sundays
Deji casually playing in his kitchen yk
We need more
fresh
i’m addicted to sidemen among us. it’ll never get old or boring
this c4 mod is so hilarious. JJ literally blew up Lachy 🤣🤣🤣.
JJ's bomb on lochy was amazing
Ok
The editing is always so elite!
I don’t think danny arons knows about the sabotage button, he could’ve sabotaged reactor and planted the bomb on the exit and boom all three killed
When did they add vikks role into the game?
Seeing lazarbeam casually throw the TV still gets me😂
I wish they made among us videos more often
Love this
Sidemen among us is GOLD !!!!!!!!
Sidemen Among Us > Any other video
should add angryginge to these
Harry being on cams every game is fine................but, HE DOESNT PROCESS ANYTHING HE SEES
Bro i love those video
putting a bom on cams early and them detonating every time you see a red dot is the way
Don't ever stop Sidemen Among Us. Pure golden content
the biggest plot twist of the century
Damn, I really wanted to see Simon get bomber
u could tell how fed up Lannan is in this video🤣🤣🤣man's so drained he let out all his frustration on his wall & is taking everyone down with him💀
Lazar uploading on every other channel except his😂 ( lazar luv ur vids)
I don't get how this is so entertaining. Ive watched disguised toast and hes brilliant at among us, but sidemen make among us 10x better. How???
“Danny Aarons and the influence of Marcus Rashford” 💀💀
dannys dog in the back😧😧😧😧😧😧
Brilliant😂
Bring pie face back 😂
One feedback for the Sidemen: we’re gonna watch the video regardless, quit putting spoiler trailers at the beginning of each video please
lachlan started off trying to avoid jj so he won't get bombed but then when no killing was going he proceeds to teach jj how to use the bomb even though he committed suicide with the bomb earlier and died from the bomb lol. jj blew up his teammate with the bomb missing 3 easy targets after being killed by his imposter buddy dannyaarons who decided he hated imposters and wanted the crewmates to live in freedom.
What is the go with Danny’s voice??
Tobi said how many times we gonna give this kid(ksi) imposter when ksi is 30 years old😂
Josh has drip
Ayo Lazar complain all u want brother it's 4 am for you or whatever so really dont worry cause youre still funny either way :D
honestly at this point u just gotta sit back, relax & watch the sidemen kill themselves🤣🤣🤣fuck "third imposter" the whole damn crew are imposters💀also ffs make deji an imposter for an entire video this man's been begging😭
Sidemen amongus is always a banger
I love sidemen among us but I love sidemen gta even more so please more
I was waiting to see Vik in the vid and have him be the bomber 💀💀
Ji killing Lachlan is soo funny 😂😂😂
“I can’t be a suicide bomber if I’m alive”😂😂
Deji got it out for lannan 😂
“I dare you little big man”-Deji
mate ive already subbed can you stop roastin my mum every video bruv
23:38 best moment of all time I'm dying
Sidemen among us will never get old! ❤
They need to leave my brother Lannan alone man 😂
These among us vids be better than sidemen Sunday sometimes ngl 😂
Bring back GTA again… all you need is to change it up and use some of the different race types
I just realized Dej is actually using his kitchen sink as a background lmfao
coming home after a night out on my birthday  to come home to this. couldnt  be a better night
#StopAannyDaronsAbuse
Ofc tobi brought up cain and Abel, bro we get you love jesus
What happened to Danny Aarons voice?
Please never stop filming sidemen among us it’s my comfort video
𝕀𝕟𝕥𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘
Just play goose goose duck. They have better roles
why haven’t they played minecraft in so long, that hunger games was my favourite 😭😭
i opened this video just to thumbs down and leave
Sidemen among us it’s god tier
“Danny Aaron’s and the influence of Marcus Rashford” has me in tears 🤣🤣🤣
Where’s vik
Can Randy stop playing cuz he just ruins everything
I’m lowkey just into sidemen among us two days ago and they suddenly post about it again today and 42 mins OH YES
can danny pls drink some water why is his voice so fucked
I can no longer watch any other among us videos besides the sidemen because the editing is so elite
Simon!!!!!!! 😁
Watching Danny as the bomber is the hardest thing i have endured in my life
They need to do a among us month, just among us videos straight
Randy’s vote mate total sense! Lazar fuck it himself
danny arrons masterclass
Danny sounds absolutely dreadful. What does that man have going on in his throat
bro why does danny sound like that
Bro i swear in the past two weeks all i did was watch among us sidemen haha
Sucide bombing hahaha 😂 13:01
16:32 "omg im Obama im Obama im Obama"
There needs to be a weekly among us vid forever
ma fabrizio romano in che senso sui sidemen
23:28 This made me laugh *a lot* 36:10 That made me laugh less so but I still laughed
this video proves that it’s not just ethan that’s the problem
People vote according to story but Randy was like nahh I don't care im voting whom i sus from the beginning of the round😂dumb as hell
deji is the best istg
I’m I crazy? Does Danny’s voice sound weird?
WHY DOES JJ NEVER VENT
Imagine vikk got the bomber role 😅
32:53 new meme unlocked
i think everyone knows why vik aint here
W
Such a great among us vid
I have 4 tabs open which all have, half watched sidemen among us videos, that i return to every now and again... Could watch these all dayyyy.... LANAN >>>>>>
Why was Lazar making eye contact with the camera for half the video 😭
Chipfat, you forgot the 'Here we go!' in the Fab tweet at the start
Lachlan so dumb. Why is he running after them smh
This is definitely a top 5 sidemen among us of all time
I want even more videos of sideman among us I’m addicted I swear
Wtf has happened to Danny’s voice?
JJ killing Lachlan with his bomb had me in tears man 😂
Danny sounds like he has peanut butter stuck on the roof of his mouth
5:53 was the best way to describe the relationship between siblings
i never watched/played among us but these are always just so fire to watch
I was js crying before this TY SIDEMAN I LOVE U SM
Very convenient that Vikk isnt in this episode.
I’m sick of Danny’s voice
I like Simon Minter but he ruins games by being too good at them
imma say it - deji best addition to the among us vids
No way that was 45 minutes I thought it was like 20 max omg 😳
JJ killing Lachlan by accident is the funniest thing I’ve ever witnessed
We need the jester
Sidemen Among Us Chaos Mode 🎉🎉 Hope it comes soon.... lol
the one time we needed vik as an imposter the most
Number one rule in sidemen lobby: never say “who we voting for?”
bruh lazerbream😂😂😂
is it even sidemen among us if simon isnt tryna get everyone to vote jj out at the start of them game lmaooo
Sometimes its stressful of stupid they can be 😭😭😭
When lachlan and lazar sussed each other after harrys death, i had the same reaction as danny😂
Simon is a sweat like 😂
Danny almost threw that last game so hard by not voting out Lazar, would have needed only 1 kill to win.
I can’t get enough of Sidemen Among Us!
lazerbeam getting killed early every video than cursing out the sdman for waking up is something that i live for lol
Deji wouldn’t have died if Harry actually reported the body
Deji in the kitchen ❤❤❤
Bruh, Randolph may be the dumbest lmao
these people really don’t know how to bomb just sabotage and get them while they’re stacked and distracted
Randy Danny and JJ have a combined 15 brain cells
Landons wall haha
One of the worst bombs ever but the most funny one of all time
"I can't be a suicide bomber if I'm alive" 💀
Randy is so dumb 🤦
They should defo do an Assasin role! The impostors have a target that they have to eliminate..and if a crewmate finishes all their tasks it shows them who is being targetted/who the impostors are tryna kill, so they can stick with them and keep them safe... would be awesome ngl
Love the redemption arc Danny got through this vid.
Is this a old video or it new
why’s danny aaron’s sound like me bean
Danny Aaron's "see ya later boys"😅😅😅
JJ did tobi dirty 😂
You should try to play with the spy (crew mate with red name for imposters), it would be hilarious
Wtf is wrong with Danny's voice? 😂 Can he cough please jesus
Deji being Harry’s protector is just hilarious 2:16
Big up Josh for wearing that epic Norway shirt🔥🔥🔥
Danny is such an idiot😂😂😂
Randy somehow is the worst sidemen player. It's incredible.
Idk I found it funny how deji called that harry just sits on cameras before it happened 😂💀
Poor tobi😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
12:25 35:55 JJ's first meeting as Impostor in the last round was also smart from him 32:09 32:23 What? From JJ's POV he didn't run into Nav (31:39)
JJ KILLING LACHY LMAOOOOOOOOO HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
It genuinely blows my entire mind how jj is successful when he is actually thick as bricks omg
Deji’s laugh is so elite they have to edit his laugh in the video even when he is dead😂
Anny Darrons is so terrible 😮 just kills themselves with the bomb 🤦🏽‍♂️
4:55 a Middle Eastern when he has a slight argument with a white guy
How is randy this bad at the game still?! 😂
Highlight was definitely jj accidentally killing lachlan 😂😂
Sdmn among us😈😈
LAZAARBEAM is the best thing ever. i love how he has infiltrated the sidemen and have become one of them!
JJ blowing up Lachlan has got to be one of the funniest Sidemen Among Us moments I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Danny blowing himself up made myself absolutely piss myself😂
I have watched every episode of Sidemen among us, this is hands down the one I have laughed at the most
Lachlan literally watched Danny blow himself up the previous round and then proceeded to immediately do the same thing
Simone’s soooo smart at this game his initial suspect is 90% right his what lazarbeam thinks he is 😂
Da Bomba 💣
Bring back proximity chat
Lazar complains about complaining now! Thats how sleep deprived he is.
still loving these among us vids
idea for another game similar to among us, there is this amazing game called goose goose duck,but in my opinion it is way better! everyone gets a role and there are always frequent updates😀
You guys should play goose goose duck
Best sidemen among us vid upload more
There is a very clear reason Vik was not invited to this recording session ...
Ksi infinite Tsukuyomi
This Combination of Sidemen Among US Guests is The funniest 😂
Dejis laughter is killing me🤣
Thanks for making me laugh😂
I always look forward to Sidemen Among Us. Makes my day always😊
36:13 “and me 😃” LMAOO 42:27 they’ve converted poor lanan
How to ruin your vids = ask danny the cringe fake kid to join who always tries to act so much.. Also danny, fix your teeths
Peak entertainment
23:32 this moment is hilarious😂
Randy is close to Ethan on becoming third imposter
The fact that randy and lannan were together and Danny was nowhere to be found made it obvious it was him but randy kinda fucked it up
Can't wait for a JJ masterclass 😂😂
Its so funny how JJ is so bad at the game
Can Danny please clear his throat it’s so annoying
actual banger
That bug noise edit scared me 28:14
nahh sidemen among us, with this group of people, its on another level of entertainment, laughed so hard man this was amazing
Randolph with the throw as usaul
Is lazarbeam just gonna destroy his entire setup and house now? The mark from the last video is still there
Sidemen Among Us is the best thing ever
A mod where the impostors can’t see who the other impostor is in these lobbies would be hilarious 💀
Lannan either is right and dies shortly after calling it correct. Or, stays alice the whole way with the worst ideas ever.
Lmao all they had to do was call lights and plant a bomb 😭 they're so dumb bro
Bro fk the comments Lazarbeam’s complaining is actually funny most the time not to mention lazar is one of the funniest in the lobby ❤
Danny suicide bombing himself and only taking JJ with him has me in stitches 🤣
Please stop Randy from being stupid
16:25 Tobi's true nature finally reveals itself
Nah Josh with the and me was golden
Can't believe no-one thought to C4 the entrance to Reactor. Call reactor, drag everyone there, everyone leaves through reactor exit in a big group, detonate
Danny had an awful game and somehow won 😭😭
What is wrong with Danny’s voice 💀💀
Lauchy’s death absolutely killed me! I almost broke my laptop 😂The mental distress that JJ killing him caused just SWEETED ME 🤣🤣🤣
This is top 3 amongus
We want proximity chat on with dej for a round
Justice for LAZAR😂
idea imposters get a clone role where they can clone themselves and set them to spawn at a specific location. so if they kill they can be cleared if someone sees their clone
Seeing everyone with their professional setups and then seeing Deji in his kitchen with his stretched screen is hilarious 😂😂
Lanan needs to start using his hacks
It's funny how Danny always gets addressed by his fullname😂
man this was a good one🤣
Bro I missed Simon in these videos😅😂
I LOVE SIDEMEN AMONG US
Jj needs to use vents more. He will kill someone in a room and just walk out. If someone is coming there gonna know its him.
Why is Danny turning into Kermit the frog
Vik not being there so much better
I got here at 666k views for anyone who wanted to know
Ksi is getting imposter alot nowadays
They should really play other maps
miami
(B
Jjs so easy to detect, he says the same things and overly extends his laugh to cover up his nerves and he smirks when he’s accused when he is the imposter, jjs like the usual set 8 imposter. When jj does too much he is so easily found out. These lads are dense 😂 Simons valid tho
Please dont ever stop posting Among us
Love the among us contents. Chaos mode is great, love the mods to keep this fresh and rotating in guest! Thank you for the content!!!
ksi's consistency for the past few months has been sensational
Sidemen among us is the best thing to touch the internet 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I saw big throw, I already knew it had to be Danny
randolph is so fucken lame pressing emergency meeting every fucken time
ok is this only me or does anyone else feel like they would have been more shocked or would have hit harder and been better for them if the danny bomber role throw wasn't gassed up and teased at the start also on twitter by chip fat? im not hating on chipfat im just saying i would like to get the element of suprise for these moments again, thats one of the reasons these sidemen among us videos are still doing good..by gassing up and teasing everything its kinda killing the content for the sidemen this is just my opinion though you are free to disagree🤷‍♂
Dejis laugh....enough said
Bruh, Randy is just the king of bad decisions I have seen him throw games so many times, does he do this on purpose?
Randy is the stupidest animal on this planet earth.
4 people alive. Call lights. They don’t fix it then easy to kill and get away with it. If they fix it then bomb lights. I don’t understand how hard that is 😭
Why anny's voice change so much
Damn, why is everyone referring to Danny Aarons by his full name? Am I missing something?
Petition to have a weekly Among us Wednesdays to get us through the week ❤
Elite content
Jj was really hyperactive and fun in this vid
Tobi needs to realize he’s getting paid and it’s not that deep lmao butthurta always
Randy is so bad now , he use to be so good but now hes like the worse player
Josh you're pretty cool man
Love spending my Sundays watching my favourite series :)) can’t get enough
Danny Aarons and his dog🥹
I swear Danny Aaron’s is inbred
This is the BEST imposter role after Sherrif. Swooper is also lit.
The End ❤ 46:13 😅
When lazar threw his screen😂
Clicking on this video and seeing the duo of JJ and Danny, I know it’s gonna be a banger😂😂😂
They gotta eliminate the brain dead ones first cuz man it’s hard just watching it “eliminate Harry, Danny, josh, ralpho or however you spell his name” cuz it’s always them that makes everyone brains bleed
Suicide bomber role basically
deji needs to always be in these
we need more bomber mod.....😀😍😎🙏
Honestly Ladden has alot of Brain cells 😂 he is immune to Sidemen Among us Syndrome 😂 42:58
Why are always sidemen among us are best
this is too funny the way jj laughs
As always Randolph ends up being the idiot. Not even surprised
Why is deji so good at this game
among us is so dead and i never play it but watching u guys play it is so fun for some reason
They should make a mod where the imposter has an actual gun and can shoot people from a distance
This has become my Sunday morning ritual. Wake up, sit on the throne and watch
josh fried 😭😭😭
Can you guys do a video where we the audience don't know who the killer is too?  Should be interesting to find out ourselves 😂
Ksi the goat
Should change more sidemen to sidemen among us! Do you not have any other content. Been watching since the start and KSI since the start, you’ve all fallen off
WHY DOES JJ NEVER VENT?
Danny Aarons masterclass, your a wizard Danny
😂😂😂 37:49
The relationship between Danny and lazar is so funny
Anyone know what sweatshirt danny has?
Deji is dirty bro needs to clean his kitchen
And Me 😂 36:20 Has me ded😂
Get tobi out fucking always kills the vibe
I was drinking water when lazarbeam said gag on a c#$# I spit it all out😂😂
I have watched every single sidemen among us video lol. Every day at lunch at work I watched them and I felt so bored after I watched them all so I started watching all the reacts videos 😂
Danny Aarons' mother and father are his aunt and uncle
I live for sidemen among us
The timing in this Lobby 😂 34:25
Is there a reason Vik wasn't in this one 🤨
23:30 this was so freaking hilarious. Funny how it turned from excitement to rage. Poor Lachlan 😂
Lazar Getting Played Now *Boys The End Is Near*
there's only one brain cell in this lobby and it's simon's 😭
Please never stop playing this
Deji's laugh is contagious 🤣🤣
JJ on rampage 😂 33:34
Why dose the sidemen not notice when harry is imposter hes not on cams
Jokes apart tho 😂😂 31:54
Tobi: How do they keep giving this Kid imposter   A few Minutes later  JJ gets imposter again 😂 31:06
23:42 the greatest moment ever omfg im dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
JJ is actually starting to think before he kills
whoever makes the custom edits for their among us stuff should change 'crewmate' to 'colleagues'
Seems simple; Plant a bomb on lights, sabotage lights, blow it up when everyone's there. Easy win.
Lazar - “post-humorously” 😂🥲
Damn I’ve been missing sdm among us vids. Need to catch up
I love how Tobi just accuses anyone who says who we voting for
Danny “now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”
Knowledge is KSI 😂 30:25
Deji’s laugh is so iconic 😂😂😂
needed sidemen among us
Its always nice to hear dejis laugh
Anyone else think lazar is getting boring af?
Sidemen Among Us >>>>>>>
Amazing sidemen among us
We need a scary game with deji & harry
I fucking love these among us videos!!! 🫶🏼 Iconic! Missing Vik & Behz though! Hope to see them back soon ☺️🧡
Big ups to Danny! He gets a lot of friendly banter and he did a delicious final round there!
Bruh who tf still plays this game 💀
Why does Danny sound so weird
haven't cried this much but jj blowing up Lachy is just infinite comedy content
Still are 25:55
Sidemen among us is literally the only thing keep among us alive lol
Luckily Viks not in this one
Was ready for Triple kills
I love  among us vids
What is wrong with Danny’s voice at the moment? Not trolling either
What is josh talking about when he says young dolph?
Is Danny's voice different to anyone else?
JJ not killing Danny Aarons is proof of evolution
A bomber…on the weekend of Oppenheimer…perfect
Among us died but sidemen amung us will 4ever be the best thing on sidemen
That first round end is not sidemen, but set 8 kids 😂😂
The fact that they didn't let vikkstar join the recording because he's too good at this bombing thing, is unfair
I love how no one ever actually uses the mayor 😂
I thought Danny would actually make a good play when he said he was gonna plant a bomb on lights then he planted it above lights 💀
I think the reason more sidemen isn't getting to 8 mil is because JJ keeps telling people they're mother stinks 😂😂😂😂😂
Awww look at them squabble 19:22
If we ignore him killing Lachlan JJ did pretty well you know
I love how amoung us is dead unless its the sidemen
JJ: i blew up all the black men. Josh: and me!! Jokessss
fr kill Simon first, guy still sweats the game in 2023 😂
This was one of the funniest among us 😂 I literally couldn’t breath when JJ bombed Lachlan😂😂😂😂
This was a  masterclass by danny and jj
I hope the sidemen never stop making these vids! sidemen among us is the best series ever
Please no more Danny he’s so annoying
Why is LazerBeam in Pablo Escacbars cellar???
the tears man
Danny and jj literilly are the dream team!
This had me howling 🤣🤣🤣
😂 15:48
dont like this style of among us
JJ is generally better at Among Us than everyone except Simon
Simon: "vote out .... " Lannon: "vote out simon" Simon: " 😡"  😂😂
Needs this with proxy chat, be so much more funny and entertaining
This is probably the best among us vid I've watched personally. I laughed all through
I don't subscribe.
Danny not doing a sabotage at the end was so stressful 🤣
lets go
Looked like students dispersing when they see the head teacher 😂 13:52
imo sidemen among us is better than the main channel videos
play among us with angry ginge!!!
I love how jj becoming better at among us and how he stopped screaming when he get caught, trust the process
lannan might be the best to play this game entertainment wise
When they stop making this videos it will be sad
Never thought we'd say the words "Danny Aarons Masterclass" in regards to a Sidemen Among Us video but here we are
@MoreSidemen great video i just love watching u play among us. But i would like it even more if the videos would be longer, cause these just end to quickly
There's a reason vic wasn't in this video
Harry with no Logic 😂 12:20
Imagine if Danny placed a bomb to kill one of them and then JJ and him did a double kill on the other two. Danny then reports one of the bodies and says that JJ placed a bomb that killed all of them. JJ gets voted out and Danny gets off Scott free
Lazar used to be big brain player but he played with the sidemen among us for so long that his iq droped down to the level of the sidemen
That one there was a VIOLATION personally i wouldn't have it 💔😹 11:56
tobi cries. every. time.
🐐  content
Order! 11:19
Making the same mistake has me ded😂 11:13
Lannon you’ve been corrupted, you need to make your own content to cure yourself
This is probably the greatest mod in sidemen among us 😂
Randolph knows ksi too good
One brother gets what the other hates. Kindred souls 😂 10:28
Bruh i hate randy. He always waffles and makes zero sense. Single handedly blew the last game. Lazar cant be blamed cuz danny played well. But randy knows that he was with lazar and lazar cudv killed him and went kn wjth the round. Its not only this video he has waffled and tried to be the smart ass and throw the game. Bring back someone like bez who atleast is fun when he plays even though hes dumb too
16:35
It's great to see Sidemen do Collab with Fabrizio Romano.🤞
Danny's voice is something else
Claim your 24 hrs ticket 🎫🎫🎫
🔥
Randy is new throw be
Just got home . About to smoke this fat ass blunt and watch the sidemen . Can’t get better than that folks
Dejis laugh😂
Well expected from LADDEN 😂 9:43
Truly one of the best & funniest Among Us videos in a while! Loved every minute of it 😂
This brings me so much joy it’s unreal😂
Plzzzzzzzzzzzzz
25:49 Lannan’s reaction 😂😂
This is my official 156 time telling u to MAKE FOOTBALL VIDEOSSSSSSSS
Perfect Timing 😂 Man just got saved 😂 6:37
Lannan ur complaining is hilarious man
The bombers were so fucking bad at this game, it was hilarious
don’t know why y’all don’t plant the bomb on cameras lol
Lannan was unusually calm this time around
Insane vid plzmake more
please add jester next time lads
SIDEMEN AMONG US IS GOOOOAAAATEEDDD!!!!
trust Tobi to bring out the Cane & Abel reference lol
these videos are perfect i dont need anything more in life thanks :)
Josh's "and me" got me rolling lmao
that last round had too many twists and turns at the end i lost my braincells. also danny could’ve voted lannan out a while back but whatever he won
I just wanted to say that we love you Lazar ❤
Well expected from ladden😂😂 3:12
23:43 32:53 45:20
That bomb from JJ was fucking hilarious timing 🤣
When he thought he had a watch 24:40 😭
simon thinks he is the centre of attrention , rain check you are not so dont chat sh*t
They should just add all the roles to make it interesting like wildcat does with multiple killer roles
Honestly the best series ever. I legit wait every day for another episode.
He knoes him so well😅😂 1:27
Danny da 🐐
I can hear the smile on your face you enjoyed your kill lmfso josh is goater
Jj killing Lachlan is the funniest thing ever
the sidemen are the sole reason among is still alive
Everyone: in their rooms  Deji: kitchen
We need a sideman video with lazer and Danny on the same team
on god simon pisses me off in amoung us
Lachlan getting blown up was the funniest thing I've witnessed in so long.
46:23 wtf was that illuminati transition
its crazy how i realized at the 40-45th minute that Vik and Ethan were not in this video 😂😂
The best game .  So far ....🎉
JJ checkin that 50k Rolex
Why does Danny sound like that now?
Another certified Randolph throw classic
Lachy: put the fcking boom JJ JJ: puts the boom Lachy: wtf
JJ tries to persuade someone to vote Simon, and JJ would win, but Simon really calls him stupid
stinky round 😂😂😂😂
Danny so focused on planting the bomb he forgot there is sabotage 😂
JJ and Deji targeting each other is so funny 😂😂
the fact that JJ was imposter the whole time was so funny 😂😂
Pls keep making these
I want 20 episodes of these to watch tonight
Danny channeled his inner terrorist 😂😂
If you indeed read these comments, you're 100 percent justified in your actions Lazar. Literally lose brain cells every time I watch one of these 😂
NAH IM DYING LMAOOOOO THIS WAS a GOLDEN EPISODE
Idk why they don't just off Simon straight at the start
Throwdolp!!!
0:21 I thought Simon said Obama role and it makes sense tho still cuz…Yk what he did to Afghanistan
What the fuck is wrong with Danny's voice?
This series is what makes moresidemen the best sidemen channel 🔥
Danny had the greatest outplay ever at cams
MORE LAZER IN EVERY AMONG US
There should be more of these videos weekly
Sidemen among us has kept me going through my breakup. Never stop guys!
lannan breaking his stuff is already too funny for me
23:40
Lochlan saying JJs got the bomb this is not good like he didnt just take himself out 3 minutes prior
They need to Stop ruining it at the start
31:53 everybody’s laughter had me dying . Tobi of all people  would be the type to just bomb himself to not play for this scuffed session
I'm glad Simon is back to bring control to the lobby. However, he needs to let more roles be played regularly like snitch, sheriff, glitch & Jester.
instant smile after you post among us
Who made this role was it vik?
Deji laughing about how Harry is allways on Cam's then Harry turns up on que 😂
JJ bombing Lachy has to be the funniest moment in sidemen among us history
Randy has the same amount of IQ as a braindead horse…
Take Danny out these vids bro
i love your among us vids even when the game is so dead
Lannan has finally lost enough brain cells that he's stooped down to the lads' level
Wasn't even jj fault for killing lachlan cause the bomb had a countdown before it went off
I’m no where near ready for the last sidemen among us video
Randy is so stupid when it comes to this man....
Poor JJ
Makes sense Danny is the brown one and gets the bomb
Honestly all Danny had to do was stand at the edge of the blast zone and he’d have won
Danny took more neck it seems.
no wonder vik isnt here
danny not sabotaging at the end was soooo bad, idk how he won
40:36 omg the Scooby laugh gets me every time 😂
i hate danny’s voice with a passion
The funniest part was when jj put a bomb and no one died expect lachlan the other imposter😂😂😂
why is there a triangle with an eye at the end of the vid
might be the best More Sidemen gaming vid of the year. not counting irl stuff they do. love some classic among us in 2023
Love how they didn’t include vik for this one to avoid the racist jokes
danny had a howler 😂
When ur an imposter the best play you can make is to kill Simon first
Not me forgetting bout the vid to stare at Danny's dog😊
You guys should always kill Simon first
This is a Lazar episode and I love it!
I drop everything to watch this❤❤
Deji is the best addition to these videos😂
Best series🔥
This was great, but Eithan is really missed!
Among us is actually the greatest series of the channel
We need more more more!!!!
JJ got the blacks and White Drake out  single-handedly… Lmmaaaoooo
Josh's "and me.." after the black joke killed me 😂
They need to bring ChrisMD back
whats wrong with Danny Aaron's voice. He's got a bubble in his throat or what disgusting
Danny has a disgustingly annoying voice
Best one yet 😂
I fucking love dejis laugh😂🤌
@9:19 Deji sounds like Milo from the Tweenies when he says “nooo! Crew mate is so boring!” 😂
These videos always go by so fast. I see it's 47 minutes, but it flew by. I need more honestly
Danny's dodgy mastache💀
32:53 this is mad out of context
Danny is the most underrated sidemen among us player he is so funny
Is KSI way different in this video or is it just me?
For JJ : for someone that cuddles and kisses and creature that feels like a ballsack you very brave to call out danny 😂 typical cat owners allways looking for beef like their pets 😂
Lazar is always so funny in these 😭
danny gets worse and worse by the week
bro deji brings such vibes
Best series is among us in sideman
swear to god i pray for this to come out weekly
Bro this has to be the funniest shit ever 😂😂😂
40:08 LMAO TOBI
Smh JJ didn't vent after killing deji.
I love sidemen among us
POOR LAZAR!!!
It got heated and goofy in the last  Danny actually have some braincells
Why does dannys voice sound like that genuine question
Stopp!! JJ I subscribed just now 🤣
36:10 Josh’s little “and me 😀” bruh had me cackling 💀
Poor editing, spoiling the video at the very start. Can they stop catering the videos to people with an attention span of 3 seconds
Stop panny paarons abuse
Bro the ending where the editors show everybody's mom, and Josh's is just a fat lion 💀
I was feeling bad for Tobi until he called Jiggly Puff a furbie
40:35 scooby doo’s laugh makes a cameo
Yall should really make more of these
harry saying whats the craic is so random but welcomed
The most scuffed collection if players innit
17:56 had me laughing when lazar said that to Danny
They should make the bomb a passing type of thing
Harry not reporting the body made me crease😂😂
Danby kissing his dog!!! To funny
Sidemen among us is the best type of videos sidemen ever uploaded to this channel  I’m down for sidemen to open up a new channel called “sidemen amoung us” I would absolutely subscribe in a heart beat
How to win as imposter tutorial  1) KILL SIMON 2) KEEP RANDY AND DANNY ALIVE
I get so happy everytime i see a new sidemen among us video thank you🕺🫶
This is the funniest sidemen among us i've ever seen 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Danny aarons bombing himself and KSI is the funniest thing i've seen
finally KSI is playing smart
How hard is it to understand the concept of a red circle?
Bro the editing on these videos always get better bigup chipfat
He literally explained at the start that you can blow yourself up 🤦‍♂️
23:39 this wwhole sequence made my day 😂
Vikk would be good at this game mode
sidemen among us should never ever die
36:20 josh- “and me😃”
Get me to UK please fot sideman charity match please 😢
Where is ethan
We want KSI sleep moment again))))
Majority of the time KSI gets caught is because he walks out instead of venting.
5:44 Wish deji would end
22:50 JJ with that Ted Dibase Jr Botchamania reference real ones know
W
Its actually CRAZY how smart Simon is, he litteraly is right on every single call
Love having Deji on this series ❤
Already laughing my @$$ of at 6:20 😂😂😂😂. You know it’s gonna be a good one & can’t wait to see more rare W big brain plays from JJ
When JJ bombed Lachlan has me in tears right now 😂
I will pay a subscription fee to watch unlimited sidemen among us. Please take my money.
JJs disbelief at that turn around was amazing
The bomb is rubbish, you cant keep anyone in it, should have a trigger for it.
23:28 funniest clip ever
i love lazar
if they ever stop uploading among us i will cry and have to be forced to rewatch there videos again... (i promise u im not being forced there videos are js too good LMFAO)
But what if my moms dead 😢 how you know she stinks jj
They need to play bomber role when vikk is back 💀
Its a crime that vikk isnt in this vid
36:19 The way Josh just joined in 💀
if i was playing with the sidemen i would win and destroy them
They won because they are blind
Randolph is the most stupid among us player, period.
Honestly the bomber is such a op role. You can literally plant it at cams and once the red light flickers just detonate it
23:38 The timing of that bomb missing 3 crewmates in a row then killing the impostor was spectacular 💣💥
Has Danny had a stroke what’s up with his speech??
how does noone just listen to simon
Ngl, I'm only here for lazar rage.
Danny sounds like he’s got his regurgitated subway blt stuck in his throat
Ksi woke up and thought lemme use my brain for once 😂😂
JJ bombing lachlan was the best thing ever happened in that video 😂
Sidemen finally Happy 8 MILLION well done guyes NOW 10 MILLION JJ SHOUTING
10:22, KSI sick of being a male lol
10:50 idiots why not get out of the red area
ICL SIDMEN AMONG US BETTER THAN SIDEMEN SUNDAY
Danny just had to call lights and place a bomb so easy
Vik would’ve been great at the bomber role
23:50 the worst play i ever see hahahah
Danny’s dog is never going to be scared of bangs or loud noises 😂
9:16 deji is a kid
Must be the funniest one ever I swear
Petition to bring the beta squad into this(or at least chunkz and filly)
The fact that they could have still somehow won at the end and Randy threw it makes him one of the dumbest to ever play the game
danny needs to clear his throat man lmfao
they are so idiots.. just turn off lights and bomb..
Cementing my Name here for future watchers to know that I watched this legendary series
Deji’s laugh is so fucking funny
W  lazerbeam
Couldn't imagine YouTube without sidemen among us ❤😅
Wayyyyy to funny. They got me coughing and laughing to death.
This has to be the funniest episode so far 😆
Finally new SIDEMEN AMONG US!! I am out of videos maaaan!! 🎉❤
Sidemen among us helps me cool off when my mental illness goes beyond control. I love it so much. I hope you keep it up.🙇🏾🙇🏾
Simons the biggest nerd on this game
❤❤
These will never not be funny 😂 Lannan is just hilarious, they all are 👏🏼
3:12 i hope this becomes a meme
Pls bring back deji
The whole sequence between 36:52 - 37:04 is hilarious. 🤣🤣
Post-humoursley😂😂
Lazarbeam might complain alot but he makes me laugh🤣🤣
The button should be banned. Ruins the fun of it. It gets too political
Do another hide and seek but with paintball or smth like thst or drunk hide and seek when ever someone gets found they do a shot or smth
Fam imagine playing with Simon he’s so shit
i was missing my ex and then i saw this notification, ill have a goodnight now
Danny Aaron’s takes stupid to new lows lol
as a muslim im very jealous of anny darons
This one's the best mod....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Guys I am sick for a week and literally only watching these among us videos AND IM SO HAPPY THERE IS A NEW ONE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🥹
Make those Among Us videos last forever,so entertaining the fact no one thought about use the bomb as a trap im coms or lights is low iq play lol
23:42 is a top 5 sidemen among us moment
It's good but it's somehow needs vik
randy bwo
Lazarbeam, like this comment if you've read it!
Why tf is deji playing from a kitchen
How many TV’s can Lazarbeam break? 😂
JJ: Honestly I had to get all the blacks out  Josh: And me.  Don't worry Josh you a brother for today
Sidemen among us is actually so class
10:05 that's my first thought. Why not mess up with lights and blow them up
30:21 He was flabbergasted 😂😂
Can we talk abt how deji is playing in his kitchen
the real sidemen sunday
Danny had so many chances to use the bomb and get rid of them at the end, what a pea brain.
23:36 I have never laughed so fucking hard in my life holy shit what are the odds of that and Lachy screaming just killed me 😂😂
Jj and Danny being imposters is so duuumb
Where Ethan 😢
would love to see a sidemen gungame  throwback on the old cod games now thag the servers are back
Josh looks like he uses natural soap
randy is actually stupid lmao
W Deji
❤❤❤
They need to do the evil/nice guesser asap
Why qre they still having danny aarons on, he's just not funny
23:35 honestly i am in pain from laughing so hard 🤣
Sidemen rainbow six siege 🤨👀
Why are they that stupid to realise it says kills everyone inside the bomb circle and then Danny does that then lachy stands in it too right after stupidity levels are high ahaha
Another day when danny is completly transparent with us
@11:33 Harry is always violating JJ the last round...He made that funny Racist joke...now he said JJ is not smart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I can’t be a suicide bomber if I’m alive “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:25 THE FORTNITE BOTTLE
nahh lazarbeam is hilarious
I thought josh said "I'm the bummer" when he was the bomber
Lazarbeam should get a role where he can’t get killed. I’m always excited to watch him play, but he gets killed first every time 😂
the new role really made it feel like vik was still here
Danny was so lucky he had Randy left there at the end. This lobby is just too good
Among Us is saving this channel everytime
You just can't get enough of sidemen amoung us 😫
Don’t you dare stop Among us
Obama role really hits
Danny Arrons making a Huge throw AND a masterclass in the same video is so funny to me
why wasn’t vik in this video?
Flies around Randolph 😂😂😂😂
sidemen among us
I wanted vik to have the bomber role
Jj is so stopped and fuuny
23:37 I thought no body is gonna die it became even more hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 the timing bro 💀🤣🤣🤣
I’d like everyone to know this is my favourite type of video on Yt fr
Sad vik wasn’t in this video 😔
I hate josh
Tobi dude a certified weirdo
Last round lol...
If chipfat sees this he’s the 🐐
Editor: "How scripted do you want it to be?"  The Sidemen: "Yes"
They playing there's an arab among us☠️☠️
They should add more interesting crew roles instead of mayor like sheriff or swapper
I enjoy these more then sidemen Sundays 😂
its not as fun without vikk in these among us videos especially this vid, for me anyway
Harry got Deji killed 😢
Deji so cringe
The editing was top notch
Let's go!!!! Thank you
“you two are like modern day Cain and Abel”  i love Tobi’s knowledge of the bible to make small little comments like that
KSI dick must be so big like bigger than his own arms😩👍
Sidemen among us just keeps getting better 😩
Danny is an amazing addition to the array of reoccurring guests
I love Sidemen among us, it is just perfect. could watch it forever
Gotta love Sidemen x Among Us
Bro Lazarbeam randomly throwing his monitor was one of the funniest things I've seen 😭😭😭 3:11
Lach do not have authority to say that jj is a bad bomber
Danny aarons ate a frog 100%
Bro Lannan’s wall from last among us 💀💀💀
I need vik in among us videos
I’m not sure what it is, but Sidemen among us just hits different
the outro is crazy
Poor Lazar, poor lazar.
This Lobby IQ levels (i consider myself pretty smart)  JJ: 3/10 Harry: 3/10 Danny: -1/10 Lazar: 8/10 Lachy: 5/10 Tobi: 7/10 Randy: 6/10 Simon: 10/10 Josh: 6/10 Deji: 7/10
14:37 😂❤
23:38 You actually can’t make this shit up😂😂
Please don't ever stop playing this game
When vik is not playing these are the best there’s no bitching about jj yelling and the game are just better
Danny played the perfect uno reverse card on Lennon 😂
23:27 lannon 😂😂
are we ignoring the fact that randy is wearing a Nottingham forest hat
Danny is just vibes!
Pie face has been sacked for deji and iv not got a problem with that 😂
Danny Illbecompletelytransparent Aarons 🐐
37:55 nah what is he doing 💀💀
Happy when I see at 45 min video on among us
Lazar Beam is probably the smartest YouTuber in the world
The monitor throw always gets me 😂😂😂
i never liked tobi yk bro dont wanna be there
Why do i get 10 ads during this fkn video .-.
does danny have something stuck in his throat
13:24
Never stop making these please I beg I’ll have nothing to watch while I eat if yo do
Tobi whines so much
bro why does danny sound so different
Sidemen Among Us is so Addicting!!! 😋😋🤤
When JJ bombed Lachlan 🤣🤣🤣
I never comment on videos but this is just hands down the best series on YouTube
ever since the frog in throat comment, i can’t listen to danny talk anymore without turning down my volume lol
JJ imposter is elite 😂
36:10 “And me” - Josh 😂😂😂
25:47 lazar's face 😂😂 when he knew he's right
Let’s be glad Vik didn’t get the bomber role
I Just Want Danny to win That Man Gets Voted Out Every Single Round For No Reason I Honestly Feel Bad For Him If I was Him I Would be  Shouting Nonstop Forever
Love watching Sidemen Among us  , definitely need another real life Sidemen among us with Deji, Lazerbeam and other YouTubers.
This is funniest Among Us video in existence OF THE GAME 💀💀
774th comment
Sidemen carry among us 😂
36:57 “Danothy Aaron’s”
46:26 Is no one gonna talk about how they put the lion as Josh’s mother. Only real sidemen fans will get the reference.
It is so painful that nor JJ nor Danny used sabotage in the last one
Danny blowing them both up was unreal
Fantastic video
Rip lazar’s wall
Man let Lazar have some good time 😂He's almost done with the sidemen 😂
Among us is the game that can live on forever like Mafia
JJ’s bomb killing Lachlan LMFAO Lachlan walked right into it 💀
Honestly I love Lazer’s constant complaining, I love watching Brits being stupid as a superior American
Simon can be super annoying
this video surely tops em all
Bruh everytime they play, I get the urge to re-install among us
sidemen should play town of salem
Why does no ever just kill Simon first and reduce the IQ of the lobby by half😂
I miss sdmn gta🙁
Sometimes I get really angry at Simon to be this good, like he shouldn't be allowed at times... He just ruins the fun and awkwardness, being so good at guessing, marinating, snitching and brainstorming
Just give Deji imposter man😂
23:28 best moment lmao
Lazar server muting danny was hilarious and well needed
I love to see them play town of Salem 2
JJ is better at the game when just doesn’t think
Tobi and the cain and abel thing was funny asf.
Sidemen amoung  us is what makes me click a video the fastest
Lazarbeam
29:19 his f*cking laugh😂😂😂
We need an imposter win count. Kinda like they did for fifa clubs goals.
I swear tobi is no where to be seen in these videos
Guess its just me who finds these videos frustrating to watch when they dont know what the roles do or how they work
POV: Your listening to Danny talk… 🐸
Idk why the don’t kill Simon first
It pains me to see the players who was smart before starting to play sidemen among us... i am big fan of sideman among us... and i can feel there IQ dropping with every episode....
"And me "😂😂😂😂 Josh was so happy to be there 😂😂😂
That first game double kill by jj and Danny had me cryingggg 😂
Sidemen need to do more Quiplash games, also why do they never play Among Us in The Airship / MIRA HQ maps?
Why not just do lights and put the bomb on lights
Not ksi getting smarter every game
I’m waiting for the day JJ and Deji get imposter. It will be more than chaos 😁
the sidemen should make an among us tournament with 15 players
Deji, Lazar and Lachlan are some of my favourite among us guests
I wonder why vik isn't in this video. It all makes sense.
Hello Lazarbeam 👋👋
We need atleast 2 episodes a week Sidemen among us!
RANDOLPH SUCKS SIMON SO MUCH
PLAY GTA NOT SOME SHITTY FKING KIDS GAME
i think the sidemen need to try goose goose duck
Lazar, if you’re reading the comments.. we love you ❤
Lazarbeams constant hatred for sidemen among us is what I live for 😂.
Y'all should add crew roles so there isn't only crew mate. It'd make chaos from all angles!!
Finally here 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lazar standing over the dead body ended up being a 200 IQ play
Sidemen and they're editor, man can't get more funny
These will never get old
I didn’t know there cud be a muslim role 😮‍💨
Ksi is a great special guest
I hate how the content is now editing driven, I remember the good old days when I could actually watch a sidemen video without being spammed with cuts and edits and fonts and fuck all. what a shame.
Please we need more of this
23:39 - I couldn't stop laughing😂😂😂
Where is vikk??? Good vid boys😂
the editing on this one was GOATED
L Simón
HONESTLY ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING SIDEMEN AMONG US VIDEOS EVER
Thank you jimmy 👍
I freakin LOVE Sidemen Among Us so much! Out of every video they do these are the most entertaining to me, even more than the big expensive productions. I end up laughing the entire video. Love em to death 😂  Also Danny Aarons, I think you're a legend!
Why is Tobi always pissed in these videos
Highlight of my day 👍
That was an absolute masterclass from Danny in the last round.
JJ says the wrong things everytime 100% of times
Fair play Danny 👏🏽 Sidemen among us is just elite each time though
JJ having a perfect opportunity to bomb three people and somehow managing to accidentally bomb his own teammate is comedy gold
The impostors should pay Lanan for sleep pills to sleep through the rounds because he keeps on dying every time on the first round😂
30:24 how is JJ confused? 😭
Ok imposters here's the biggest IQ play you can make at the start...Stop killing Tobi first??? And Crewmates if you don't want the round to drag forever then you can literally WIN off of TASKS! Sidemen Among Us is starting to get stale so implementing Neutral Roles/Crewmate role with abilities will really motivate everyone to play. 1 Neutral (jester or executioner are 100% needed right now), 5 crew with abilities(sheriff, engineer, mayor etc) should be a staple every game to keep it interesting. The mod has so much possibilities and just keeping 3/4 of the players as normal crew is such a waste.
Dejis Laugh>>>>
@RandolphUK .
Even though this game is dead as hell as long as the sidemen are playing it I'll watch it every time
The "and me" Josh said made me laugh out loud
Not lachlan blowing himself up after danny did that and lost the game😂
Siemens among us carry the whole among us community
danny showcasing two types of masterclass
Deji reads ksi like a book
Dejis laughing is too hilarious 😂
How has Danny not cleared his throat yet😂
I thought Danny was dumb after that suicide bomb plant, but then Lachy did it straight after 😂 smh. Some dumb people get rich.
Yes!
Lannan if you are reading this thank you so much for being a part of my childhood and thank you for not losing your energy and humor
WTF is wrong with Danny’s voice???
Sidemen among us videos are the only thing keeping me alive and sane rn
Would this be more chaotic with Kai on here ?🤔
Add Jeremy Lynch to the charity match
Love u lazarbeam
Star of the video was Danny’s pup in the background
i'd watch a 2 hours long SIDEMEN among us video
I love deji's laugh soo fkn much 😂😂😂😂
The bomb should be remote detonated instead of pretty much instant
23:40 hearing lachlan beg for jj to place a bomb only to be blown up a second later has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen lol
ahahahahah lazar just hates them probably
Pleeeeasseee more among us  I've watched every sidemen among us at least twice
Best Sidemen Among Us Episode.😂
Moreeee🤣🤣
I’m so glad they keep doing these videos 😊
NEVER STOP WITH THESE
Danny aarons finally kept his promise to lazarbeam and killed himself 🙏
Geez randy is so cringe and what he says doesn’t make sense 🤢🤢🤢🤢
Vik shouldn't have missed this one. If you know what I mean
36:50 game turning point
Im addicted to sidemen among us😂
These videos are the ultimate boredom curerer
With deji its just more jokes 😭😭
YOU 🍩💀                        TO, LANDOLF😂😂😂😂
Danny Aaron’s voice pisses me off
JJ Killing lucky was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legendary sideman among us
Danny Aarons being Danny Aarons😂😂
Of course Vikks not playing this time
Thank god vik wasn’t in this one, the game would’ve been a little too explosive
JJ looking at his wrist with a caption "Blud thinks he's got a watch" got me dead
Bro, JJ bombing Lachlan was the funniest shit😂😂😂
They made sure Vikstar wasn’t here for this
Not having vik in the video with a bomber role should be illegal
This whole video is frustrating 😂
23:35 KSI masterclass
Harry “Danithy Aaron’s” 🤣 36:58
Can’t stand this dudes nasaly ahh voice bro
How many videos that Danny has been in has he not been imposter. It’s always him I swear
lmaooo
“And me” Josh Saïd 😂😂😂
If sidemen want more subs they have to make more sidemen videos for sure no other way
Where the duck is vik
Would’ve been nice to actually see the bomber in action more
JJ accidently bombing lachlan was jokes 😂😂
Need sheriff and jester not just impostors and crewmates
Why is Deji in the kitchen?
Seeing Lazars wall getting more and more abused for each game is hillarious
JJ has gotten a lot better as imposter  Edit: To everyone who disagrees, do you know remember the first time he was imposter
Bruh 😂😂😂😂
Josh’s “And me” was hilarious 36:21 😂😂😂
How no one figured out lights as bomber for so long was elite
tf who plays among us anymore
23:42 BRO IAM FUCKING CRYINN 😭😭😭😭💀💀
I feel like they would enjoy this more if they each had their own role. Make the videos more fun
I finallllllllllyyyyy got some good content this week bro ❤
23:38 is the new best sdmn among us moment
LET LANNAN GET IMPOSTER GOD DAMMMMMM
Danny Aarons masterclass
Being stupid is sometime funny but here this is annoying f em ruined the video
You guys should add executioner for the next one it would be so funny
funniest among us game in a while. the impostors bombing themselves was pure comedic my stomach started hurting from laughter
this is thebest lobby with lannan, lachlan and danny aarons
they should continue making sidemen among us. can never get enough
everyone else that plays this game is boring other than the sidemen tbh
21:38
I was binge watching all the sidemen among us videos these past 2 days over and over again and now there's a new one in perfect time!
Nah Danny is legit the dumbest guy I have ever seen, hes way worse than JJ & Ethan
The subscription reminder at the end🤣
It's being long since I've seen Vik
Fabrizio with the “here we go!” mid video. Legend
I’ll never get tired of them making stupid decisions 😂
40 mins lets gooooooooooooo!
23:41 legit one of the funniest things I’ve seen 😂😂😂
Danny Aarons is a national treasure
36:08 -  36:26 are possibly the funniest 18 seconds of my life
"your the imposter bwuv"
23:40 abomination
I love the original map with simple or no mods
But where was vik tho
i'll be the one to say it Lazerbeam we fucking love you
Among us sidemen is the best thing. I hope they keep this is going
All Danny had to do was call lights and drop bomb. That was a hard watch.
Randy holds the record for the most throws ever
Danny wants to do what to someone?! 4:54
Poor Lannan
I wanna see vic with this bomber role
Need more roles 😂
Is it just me who thought Danny sounded really odd throughout the video? I also loved how Lachlan killed himself with the bomb then the next round he said "JJ is the bomber, this isn't good" 😂😂😂
Underrated moment #7 Josh: And me! 😂
Dear MoreSidemen, I know you probably won’t read this message, so because of that, I have nothing to say
Why does Danny Aarons sound like stitch in recent videos 😂
Happy weekend everyone
what if vik end up getting the bomber role
I wanted all of them to stand on top of each other and then the bomber drops the bomb, just curious to see who wins if they all die
For the love of God, someone show KSI how to use vents 😂😅
Everyone just checks cameras and runs away from each other lmao
Tobi literally hates on JJ so much. Jealousy is real.
I'm always happy af when I see an Among us video from Sidemen and friends
"I wanna bomb someone." - Danny Aarons, 2023
smart to not have vik with bomber mode
8:28 Didn't expect the most KSI thing to come from Danny Aarons
the bomb is tooo funny not jj killing lachlan
i'm curious if lannan actually reading the comment, the last game was mad , i wonder how lannan reacting to the comment
Amogus is sigma no cap🧢
When JJ blew up no one else apart from Lachlan 😭😭😭😭
What if Vik got the Boomer 💀
Danny Aarons knew what he was doing blowing himself up. Bloke thinks he's so funny
I need 2 hours sidemen among us bc 46 minutes not enough
the sidemen need to play SPC 5K
Did anyone else notice that Simon is playing as his mum
''little big man'' -deji
JJ “I had to get rid of all the black people” Congrats on becoming black Josh!
SIDEMEN AMONG US: OPENHEIMER VERSION
Simon fucking ruins content by being so trynard
Please don't stop putting this bomb mode because it's so hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
The bombers are a stinker 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😅😅😅😅😅 WHAT THE FUCK JAY JAY, what the fuck!!!!😀😀😀
JJ 😂😂😂
Bomber should call lights then mess with them so they don’t get fixed then just bomb everyone there.
There's nothing that makes my day better than the SIDEMEN these guys are absolute legends
SIMON IS BACK LETS GOOOO
When Deji got off cams and Harry was stood there 😭😂
The best part of these is how no one acctually knows how there roles work XD Im creasing
I would have quit by now if I was lannan. He is just always dying or never winning. I wanna see lazerbeam get the to be imposter back to back for at least 5rounds.
Just keep uploading these videos every Saturday please
34:18 omfg jj thought he was turning lights off but he actually just locked the electrical door how fucking stupid that is Im legit impressed wtf
13:12 dog bites face
Danny Aaron's sounds like he's got a mouth full of jelly!!
If among us is dead the sidemen is its life support
It was fully Lachlans fault for running into that bomb
Sidemen among us is honestly the best content on youtube. Hands down. Every time i see sidemen among us pop up in my notis, i get snacks, prep everything and then sit down and watch it. Its literally the best series on youtube.
What's up with Danny's voice lads
KSI’s the goat
It makes sense why Lazar is complaining I would too if I was in this lobby
Yo JJ's getting good at these broo
Randy actually just kills every game by calling meetings all the time STOP
Bro I forgot tobi was even in this vid lol 😂
Lannan please don't change😂
love see more of the bomb mod!!
The ads are getting out of hand
this man tobi going through it.
23.48 is one of my favourite ever among us moments 🤣
Anyone else think Danny’s new voice is hilarious?😂
Yesssss i love the longerrr videos
NEED MORE AMONG US DAILY
Play Duck Duck Goose
Lazar breaks a monitor every video now 😂
smart not having vikk in this video
Only reason am subscribed 2 this channel
When Harry said it couldn't be JJ who killed the three people in Electrical, because JJ isn't smart.  *I've won, but at what cost?*
Tobi is actually such a cry merchant
@RandolphUK
23:36 funniest moment througout the video😂
why does danny still sound like this
Josh's mum at the end 😂
too many ads
BRO HOW MANY GODDAM ROLES...
Yo whats up Lazar
I think the imposters are rigged, not complaining though. Good content
"Blud thinks he's got a watch" HAHHA
This is definitely one of the best more sidemen videos😂 So many funny moments😂😂
36:10 got me😭
somehow danny aarons is even worse as an imposter than as a crewmate
all lazar does is cry man, says the same intelligence thing every video
“Can we vote for a dead body” got me rolling on the ground 😂
Just a question here, does the cursing, screaming and begging people to subscribe actually work? Cause its really annoying!
YEAH!!!!
Danny Aarons with the greatest Among Us throw of all time.
❤
For some reason this felt like such a filler episode
JJ is getting more and more smarter
Danny Aarons master class
Noooo 1 hour
Tobi giving JJ shit for being bait as impostor saying “this round stinks” even tho everytime he’s impostor he plays the card “you guys always vote me anyway so go ahead”
among us with Simon feels so boring, glad he's back!
Exactly what we needed
Deji laugh is the best😂😂
KSI imposter addition 😂
I get why vikstar isn't in this video
Josh….and me😂😂 36:15
1:30 into the video and already an ad 😤
This is the best series. ❤ this comment and let the SIDEMENS know
To be honest I feel like the vibes felt very off by the end of this video, just felt like you guys wanted the games to end which isn’t very enjoyable to watch
Do any of the sidemen ever go barefoot ??
JJ killing his own teammate has to be a top tier Sidemen Among Us moment😂😂😂😂
Josh talking about "That's not nice" when he bullies Harry regularly on GTA
jj was born to have the imposter role stg, the nightmareeeeeeee
Bro we need more Bomber rounds. I really wanna see someone do light/oxygen, then drop a bomb and after leaving,  lock everybody in there.
I love deji's laugh man
Randy is so dumb and annoying
lmao lannan just have that broken monitor laying around for rage in order to cope with sidemen among us
20:35 THATS MY FAV SONG AND MY FAV SIDEMEN(AKA HARRY)JUST SANG IT AINT TO WAY❤
DanyAarons not hitting the button cause he was muted and wearing sweatshirt that says childish was perfect
my fav series Ong
45min of sidemen among us, life is good sometimes
Never clicked so fast
Crazy how vik is not in the bomber episode💀.
JJ: “That was the worst bomb ever man.” Hiroshima: …
23:36 the next ten seconds might be the funniest ten seconds in all of sdmn among us
this bomb mod gotta stay in
I died when jj bombed Lachlan 😂😂😂
I am pretty sure that Danny is single handedly responsible for lowering the average IQ of UK 😂😂😂😂
They need to change the title to Danny Aron’s Master Class he had randy and Lazzer fooled what an absolute play love Danny hes so funny
i luv sideman amogus¨
Danny killing JJ and then JJ killing Lachlan with the bomb is the funniest among us moment for a while😂 This is why we love sidemen among us videos. Despite not even playing the game
This is what I live for
Saturday for sidemen among us 😂 Sunday for sidemen Sunday 🎉
This game was tailor made for the sidemen
I can watch this for years on end. amazing vid lads the way JJ killed Lachlan 😭😭
missing vikk man!
I just love Harry singing in these videos it’s funny 20:36
Anny Darons has the biggest bubble lodged in his throat, he needs to cough asap
Let’s be glad Vikk isn’t in today. Might’ve been voted out first every time because of a bomber😂
Sidemen among us is one of the best things
For the first time one this channel LaZar got played by someone
If vikk would have been the bomber then believe me the whole lobby was gonna regret that decision.
Sidemen beat themselves 💀
please make more of these
I lowkey miss vik in these lobbies :(
Godlyy!!🎉🎉
When i see new sidemen among us video i instantly relax😊😅
when you see deji play you know it will be funny
I never get tired of the Among Us videos
When you realize its 40 minutes long... happy tears
Damn jjs actually playing the game so smartly
As a 21 year old, please dont do that autotune sh*t... its so horrible to listen to
why does danny sound like a marshmello this game
23:42 funniest moment of all their among us videos
Turn off the lights mess with lights don't let them fix it wait until they all close and put the bomb
"Since he said that, that means i can actually kill josh" JJ's smartest moment on among us
Why does Lannan complain so much
Sidemen among us is what I live for. If the sidemen ever stopped doing videos, if they just posted among us I’d be happy
RIP Lannan's monitor 😂😂😂
yesssss
@VIK, where you at?
One of the few times were Randy throws the game and isn’t treated like a complete idiot
Harry needs an official cameraman role
Simon is never imposter
This is one of the funniest among us in a while .
We need daily episodes of this
W
Ksi, how do you know that my mom stinks ? Are we related ? Are you my lost dad !
jj's mic always be loud asf
I feel bad for lazar
I LOVE SIDEMEN AMONG US
Good thing Vik wasn’t in this video
I’m surprised Vik wasn’t there considering the mod they had
What’s wrong with Danny Aaron’s voice?
These are by far the best more sidemen. Once a week among us would be very good.
JJ blowing up Lachy at 23:30 has me dying. Best Sidemen Among Us moment 😂😂😂
Thank god Vikk wasn’t here
what's tobi's problem,  always complaining
Simon acting like he did sum mfs blaming lazarbeam
How is his voice still stuck like that cough 😂
Sidemen among us on a Saturday night and Sidemen Sunday tomorrow is the best combo
Sidemen among us goes the same way every video Danny and JJ get voted out whether they are imposter or not Simon pulls some crazy shit out of nowhere and somehow gets it right Tobi gets killed very early on  And lazar complains about the lobby being stupid.
What's wrong with Danny Aarons ?
All them imposters and no wins😂
Keep the sidemen among us rolling please 😂
Lazerbeams iq is 999+
He could’ve gone faster but slipped a little in the last sector 😅
23:35 The greatest Sidemen Among Us moment ever.
Love your video
Why do I keep hearing Obama instead of bomber 😭
Why Danny sound like that
I love how lazar always stays at the spawn for longer than everyone else then complains when he dies early
Doing a task next to a dead body is so Harry like
sus
i’ve been binging sidemen among us i need more to watch
vik not being here is a crime he wouldve been perfect for this
Sidemen among us is the greatest !
Wtf is wrong with Danny’s voice? Dude needs to clear it please
what happened to dannys voice?
I like how they always know it’s JJ but they let him enjoy himself anyways😌
Love sidemen amping us!!
Joshs and me was jokes
JJ has increased his IQ since coming back it’s the best character progression
Deji is actually jokes in these videos
MILK and KSI DUO VS DANNY AND KSI
Bro never stop makin among us vids 😂
Lanan has had enough 😭😭
"KSI as infinite impostor" Round 2: KSI as crewmate. 🤡
We don't really feel that Ethan is missing from these lobbies because Randolph really replaces him with the same IQ level. Holy duck this man is stupid
I thought Simon said Obama role at the beginning instead of a bomber role lmao
Can yall take out the guy with the weird voice bruh he annoyed me the entire video. His throat sounds swollen
sidemen among is actually so damn good. as a long term sidemen fan i think this is up there with one of their best series
0:46 LMAO
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣he bombed lachy
Eating pasta whilst watching sidemen among us is the best combination
23:42 is gold😂
Right decision to leave Vikk out of this one :D
Sidemen among us gives me life sustaining energy
Sidemen among us❤❤❤❤❤
💣
Yeah Randolph is stupid
Wtf has happened to Danny Aaron’s voice ?
20:34 😂😂😂😂
Danny needs to swallow or something man
i can watch sidemen among us 24/7 hours without taking a Break
"Well i think its someone smart" JJ 😒
Woomate
First
Harry on cams is just a necessity
Bro Danny suicide bombed himself and KSI,  this was accurately pleasant .
Have been binge watching the previous sidemen among us videos And this popped up at the perfect timing
That and me from Josh killed me
Bro laser always gets killed first
Jj actually played well as an imposter in this whole video
This is the best one yet
Why always lazarbeam 😂 i feel bad for him
I love how the editors always add dejis laugh when someone says something funny, because they know its a hilarious laugh
Danny bombing hismelf and JJ is why making Among us video's is still worth it, it just creates for so many organic moments. More sidemen just reminds me of when they used to play games and upload them to their second accounts.
Im still confused why danny sounds likea frog
Randy is actually in love with Simon icl
Why does Danny talk like that?
We need more sidemen among us
Love how Deji calls JJ a mother fucka 👀
This is the one game that’s fun, not because you’re good at it, but because everyone else is terrible as well.
Sidemen among us best series
forever appreciating Sidemen Among Us
Dubbeljuw videjo men
Wish vik was in this video… Harry would be on a roll 😭😭😭
That KSI, Lachlan bomb moment was one of the funniest in sidemen among us history
Sidemen among us is one of the funniest things ever
Gib would love this role
43 minutes god dayum finally early to a sidemen vid
I was starting to believe danny is getting better at this game but then this happened 😂
Imposters killed by bombs 4, crewmates killed 3 24:38
Ey guys is dej gay just wndering i mean its ok but is deji gay?
Why does Danny Aarons sound like that
Danny😂😂😂
For maximum chaos, the bomber needs to call a sabotage, put the bomb at the sabotage, and watch the absolute carnage! If they get disperser and miner then you can plant a bunch of mines in one location, plant a bomb, then disperse (which sends everyone to vents). A good example of this being done is BonsaiBros, Nogla or KYRspeedy!
Josh “And Me” 😂😂😂
I’d be happy if MoreSidemen was just among us, honestly like an episode & I love it
josh saying 'and me' has to be the funniest thing in recent sidemen vids lolololol
Sidemen should play the duck goose version
moremoremore among us pls pls pls makes my day
Get rid of Danny man, so unentertaining
Sidemen among us videos are elite and the best videos on MoreSidemen
I can understand why vik wasnt here for this one
Sidemen amnogus never is boring
Before 8 MiL club  👇
Good vid
I havent heard lachy swear that much in a long time🤣🤣
Ksi: “i had to get all the black ppl out”  Josh: “and me” 😂😂😂
Here within 1 millisecond gang      👇
They need to have the bomber at like 10% chance so then 1 every 10 games there’s a bomber but people won’t be as scared to stack on lights
Lannan had amazing guessing skills
Can yall please find literally anyone else other than Danny Aaron’s.  He’s not like a funny mentally ill he’s just annoyingly mentally ill
7:11 spot on 20:17 that cackle I’m crying 20:36 wouldn’t be a sidemen among us without Harry singing randomly
Do sidemen among us forever
Love Among US
Sidemen really keeping this game alive to be fair
3:16 another Lazarbeam rage moment 😂😂😂😂😂
23:42 must be one of the best sidemen among us moment ever
46min among us yes please
What did lazars monitor ever do to him 😂
I need them to never stop playing this game. Sidemen among us is truly my favourite content on the entirety of YouTube
We always want more and. More sidemen among us
“I hope he’s killed himself” -Harry wroetoshaw 2023
Poor lazar
23:42 ( lachlan : wtf ) had me dying 😂
That Harry auto tune 🔥
I love these sidemen among us they are always interesting 😊
By the end of the year, Lazar wont have a wall
Deji too?!!???!!!?? 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Among us  for life 🙌
Nah everybody get to the cench and drake tune
GUYS ITS HAPPENING!!!! MORE SIDEEN AMONGUS!!!!!
First 5 minutes KSI masterclass 🎉🎉

Oh yea~
Harry backing and insulting JJ was such a harry thing 😂
Deji just laughs on  his own
JJ bombing Lachlan is jokes 😂😂
Lachlan is class 😂😂
Can someone please make something out of 7:34 a sound or something PLSSSS
The JJ bomb kill on Lachy has me dying😂😂
Nah jj killing lachy had me rolling
Why vikk is not there
Why is it Danny Aaron’s sounding like that recently
Harry is my favourite person to ever exist
Petition to have Ethan back
23:40 😂😂😂😂
this is a national treasure, the bomber makes for the most incredible throws known to mankind, and mix it with a little sidemen and u have incredible entertainment
The game should be called sidemen not among us
Couldn’t imagine how bored I would be without the sidemen among us😂😂
Watched all of these and I swear JJ is getting WAY smarter 😂 man’s actually coming up with strats
Lazar and deji make this game come alive
Danny took the role of 9th crewmate💀
Let fucky gooo
Harry is so dead on this game lmao
32:52 it be your own people
that bomb on lachyy killed me :')
What is op with dannies voice!!!
Bro sidemen are goated
Pakistani role i like that
Love it
Guys, I think he is Obama 16:34
W2S plays video games for a living but he is too lazy to even do that so he just sits on cams and does nothing.
Lannan's everlasting rage against the imposters and the Sidemen in general is icing on the cake.
LazarBeam Rage Quits!
When JJ planted the bomb and accidentally killed Lachlan I'M DEAD 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Sidemen carry this dead game
Love lazar beam❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
They couldve won the first round but dannyaarons doesnt have any brains
Last time wasn't this dumb. This is one brain cell masterclass plays.
Just call lights stall the lights then plant the bomb how did anyone not think of that
15:48 elite comparison
The only bad thing about sidemen among us is that it has to end and we’ve got to wait a long time for the next one
Harry: "crewmate, you know what that means- on the CAMSSSS" 💀
Danny blowing up himself and JJ at the same time is peak 😂
#KeepLazerAlive❤
Sip
I’m glad Deji is here again
Does JJ not know how to vent
Brooo i hate the spoilers in the beginning i cant lie jovbmlgxfkdvnjkjlnzdlbdm
Vik wasnt here in this video so they added his role!!
the 23:38 had me creasingggg lmaoooo
50 minute among us... yes please, time to eat
Good vid
Osian
I never thought I’d miss Vikk and Ethen in Among us videos
JJ kiling lachlan with the bomb was the funniest part 😂
Danny is officially the stupidest guy I have ever seen in among us
Among us videos are doing better numbers than other sidemen videos.  Love it.
Plz get Danny out of sidemen among us
I miss vik
#KeepLazerAlive❤
#KeepLazerAlive❤
I think danny blowing himself AND JJ up was one of the funniest things I've seen all week
Bro it’s been 27 mins and I only realised rRandolph was also in the vid 😂 💀
16:26 That edit was awazing😆
23:36 Had me in TEARS 😂😂😂
These lot should defo play prop hunt among us
@RANDOLPHUK 😂❤ who's a good woo mate ur a good woomaye
Randys the best Woomate
Can’t get bored of this🤣
Okaaaaay more amogus!
Current sidemen among us group is PERFECT
Okaaaaay more amogus!
Sidemen among us is a top3 series in the sidemen channels.
Harry is the most unintentionally funny person ever. I don't think he even realizes 😂😂
Ksi as imposter is like asking a homeless person for money, it’s fucking pointless. (Still love u tho jj)
Do they still not know that you can just call comms and then harry can’t look at cams or admin?
Even Ethan's third imposter play couldn't be nearly unreal as that instant bombing of Danny 💀
24:05 😂😂
Level 2 Gyat 😢
W KSI plays
Good thing Vik isn't here, or else the jokes would be mad.
Deji has been a real fun addition to these among us games
Wtf is wrong with Darrens voice?
This is some of the best content on YouTube hands down!!! Love everyone ❤
Is Lachlan allergic to the kill button?
Make a whole channel dedicated to sidemen among us trust me we will get it to 10 million subscribers lmao
Its been years i forgot about this game
Lazarbeam is jokes 💀
Oh Lazar hating life must be a sidemen among us
Its a great day when sidemen upload among us
Can you do more Fall Guys please
yesss among uss!!!!
The second it said to tweet randy I tweeted randy lmao
Where's the gta vids
Finally 🎉
hi
we need more of deji!
Chipfat is the 🐐
No sidemen among us video is complete without the mayor role
14:37 KSIMON 😂❤
Love sdmn among us
Petition to bring back sidecraft!!
bro you can see the mark that lannan's monitor left when he threw it lmaooooo
#KeepLazerAlive❤
I don't think sidemen among us can be boring in a century
21 minutes late gang
Who gave Danny the bomb
LAZARBEAM and DANNY is probably the best duo on among us
Can we just have daily among us uploads at this point!
They should come up with a invisible imposter or a sniper, where u can kill someone from long distance
zerkaa norge
The Fabrizio tweet was fking perfect
do people actually like danny aarons?
The double bombing was the funniest shit ever 🤣🤣💀
Love seeing roles that Vanos' crew used. I think it's about time there is a crossover moresidemen vs vanos crew among us.
didn't knew danny was a paki🤐💣
why does danny sound like kermit frog 🤣
Deji in among us is amazing 😂
I thought Simon said’ “we got a OBAMA ROLE” 😭
10:13 like vork simon that was what i was thinking like sometimes i smh at this lobby
Jj has a perfect game for Danny to fumble 😂😂😂😂
Luckily vik wasn’t in this video😅
Danny Aarons has tonsillitis
Danny killing himself and JJ is one of the best things i have ever seen in this game
1:17   7:51 7:54   8:27 bro killed himself and his teammate lmao   9:14   10:50 10:53 11:01   11:14 SHUT UP 11:16 11:17  11:36   12:35 12:42   18:47   19:08 19:14   23:38 bro killed his own teammate   28:54   31:37   32:52   34:21 34:24   34:52 34:55
Yippe
Loveeee thisssss
nah cl danny arons voice is getting so annoying
Sidemen among us is always a treat
Yes another vid
honestly the editors are spot on, the way they edit little details always finds a way for me to be intrigued in the video. spot on truly  👏
Ready to rewatch this 10 times , let's goooo!!!
Wait what did lazar just destroyed the monitor he was playing on or what!
Does Deji actually play in his kitchen i thought it was a green screen
Stop having DannyAarons until he figures out his frog in his throat. Difficult and gross to listen to
Wish they edited in batman charging at the joker from "the dark knight" and joker saying "come on, i want you to do it, hit me" when deji and JJ were on cams in that 1st game 😂
The best map
Danny is the youngest right hows bro so shit
I love the mark on the wall which the tv left when lanon threw it.
Please never stop uploading Among Us
I like how both the brothers have Pokemon skins ❤
hey
Bro Deji is unintentionally so good at this game. He always finds the imposter without any reason 😂
this bomber role is elite
You know it’s a good day when sidemen uploaded a among us video
Should call lights than place bomb 😂😂
5:55 😂😂 wow.
Finallllllyyyyyyy
"Getting quite defensive for a suicide bomber" another iconic Harry line has been born
1 like = 1 prayer for Lazarbeams monitor
JJ is getting better at the game
Not me thinking it was Sunday today and looking forward to a sidemen Sunday I’m happy now 45minutes if moresidemen
смешное видео🔥
If the moresidemen channel posted Sidemen among us only i would still watch whole day
Danny is literally Behzinga 2.0
Deji would pay for imposter role
Plz leave a like on this comment
My fav episodes of sidemen
8:30 OHHHH MY GODDDD LMFAOOOO
Randolph #1 woomate
😂😂😂always gets me
W
Sidemen among us never gets boring.
This lobby is so cancer i love it
They say there can be too much of a good thing, the Sidmen Among Us prove otherwise. I can’t get enough of it!
Lazer we love you
How dumb do you have to be to not realize that when you have the title of "bomber" you probably shouldn't stand in the big BRGHT RED area where you just placed the bomb
Neaver been more happy to see a video come up

Lazerbeams wall still has the scratch from his monitor lol😂
Bro went bin laden 💀
There goes Ladin again thrown his monitor
Danny of course would be a suicide bomber
How ironic danny looks like a school shooter and gets the bomber role and just wants to blow people up 😂
Ayo ive never been this early tbc
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
More more, I love it
Perfect i just got mc Donalds and u released the video 11 mins ago so i got s perfect video to watch when i eat
Let's goooo
I haven't seen it yet. Can we get another one?
Am i the only one who hates Danny’s voice ?
Can we get more jester 🙏🏻
LIES!!! The title is ALL LIES
I love this series soo much, soo many top tier funny moments.
Keep up the good work sidemen
Another sidemen among us . what a great way to start your weekend
B-b b b ba BANGER VIDEO
Let’s gooo sidemen among us amazing
Poor Lazar bro
imagine bombing right after the meeting is over that would be jokes
Sidemen amongs us 👈🏼🔛🔝
I see sidemen among us, i click!
One day Danny will have a masterclass, he can't keep going on like this 😂  Edit : Watched the last round, turns out he did have a masterclass
Fanny karen ruins every video 🤦‍♂️
laz guy must be protected
A
Jj is such a bad imposter
Sidemen among us only among us to hold up
Among us never fails us
Sidemen carry all among us content
😀
Does Danny wear a retainer, this is like the third video it sounds like he has a bubble in his throat lol
I love these videos with the sidemen play among us
More sidemen needs more games please
Danny took over Ethan for being the most dumb
Why does Danny sound like that?
As a mattress of a fact
Its a good a day when they have ksi as a guest 🗿💀🗿
JJ's continuous laughter is pure bliss 7:00 Sidemen's Among Us never gets old
A video worthy of watching while eating.
I need to turn off my brain whenever I watch these lmao
Congrats I only made it 6 seconds into the video before I clicked off…
Probably THE BEST series I've ever watched easily
why does danny keep speaking like that? genuine question
Bomber Role? just in time for Oppenheimer.
why is JJ lowkey starting to get a hold on how to play among us properly.. its scary because JJ might end up becoming dangerous as he's very underrated
lazar is so annoying
Sidemen among us never fail to entertain us! 👍🔥
lazar throwing the computer while everybody went "oooooooooohhhh" was unnecessarily funny
LOOOL WHOS HERE AFTER KSI DIED OF CANCER??
Lazarbeam casually smasing his monitor is the funniest shit
3:12 BEST MOMENT😂
I hope I'm not the only one Binge watching these sidemen among us videos.
Genuinely is still their best content
Danny Arons is genius😂😂
You guys NEED to stop playing on the same map all the time please
Can you guys play fifa against each other
Great, a daily dose of probably the stupidest yet funniest Sdmn among us video 😆
Sidemen among us is the best entertainment on youtube
I swear I see  Gatorade ads every time I click to sidemen
People who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like
Sidemen among us is the best!
why tf does Dany arrons sound like a frog
Love you sdmn 🧡💜
Sidemen never fails to entertain
46 min sidemen among us, i can't ask for better

First to comment
I can’t believe the added the Terrorist role this time
I was looking for a video to watch and I see this 😅❤
I love your videos
😂😂😂
1:05 "GOT A SUSPECT PACKAGE RIGHT THERE"💀
L E T S G OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Beta Squad video and now 46:35 mins of Sidemen Among Us, life is good
You know it's a good day when you see a sdmn among us notification
I wish they would stop spoiling the best moments of the video at the very start, it would make for a much funnier moment if we didn’t know that Danny would have blown himself up since the start of the video. Just let it build up to the moment, please.
Vik not being here for the bomber role is crazy😂😳
Deji making fun of Harry going on cams then Harry shows up 😂😂
I speak for everyone when I say “WE NEED MORE SIDEMEN AMONG US”
Sidemen among us is goated
sidemen among us has to be my favorite series.
I hope they never stop with among us even if the game dies
The only time ill ever be caught watching among us 💀

Hi
I guess the Sidemen made a smart business move and didn't put Bomber in the title :)
The fact that jj and harry both said “neutral wtf is neutral” was perfect.
