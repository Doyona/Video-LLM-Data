The person who sold the is it cake making kit was actually on is it cake!
I love Hope and the channel but it really irks me that she just gives her dog anything because there have been a handful of times I have seen her give something that is actually toxic for dogs and chili powder can be horrible for their digestive system and cause major vomiting and upset stomach
Ahh a live plant 😄
Who's here in 2025 also hope changed so much
I had the astronaut light, but it broke😅😩😩😅😅

Hey Hope!  I wanted to give you a heads-up about those multi-colored flame candles. Different elements from the periodic table can produce unique flame colours, ranging from blue to yellow, green, and even pink. However, some of these elements can be toxic, particularly when it comes to the fumes they release. Keeping these candles on your bedside table and constantly inhaling the fumes could be harmful. Please be cautious, girl! Chemistry may seem fun, but it can be dangerous.  Sending loads of love from India!
Do you look like Katy Perry with the black hair?😮

Omg my uncle has the astronout thing
Hi, I really enjoy your  videos :) Dogs don’t react to spicy food the way humans do because they have fewer receptors for capsaicin—the compound that makes chili peppers hot. So while the dog might not show visible discomfort, it can still experience internal irritation, especially in the stomach and intestines. Giving spicy food to dogs can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and pain, even if they don’t show it right away. Just because they 'don’t react' doesn’t mean it’s safe or funny. Please treat animals with care and respect.
DID THAT DOG JUST EAT A GUSHER?!?! That's the coolest dang dog i ever seen.
I absolutely love pickles my husband always has to get extra pickles so I have extra pickles to put on top of my extra pickles on a burger or anything that comes with pickles so I need that shirt I just don't think it's worth $44

Thos watermelon gum are in my supermarket 😂😂😂
Hope, I really like your content and I think you don't have bad intentions, but you give your dog SO much food he's not supposed to eat, especially sweets, sugar is bad for dogs and those gusher candies probably have a ton of artificial colors, sweeteners and god knows what. Please, stop giving him that stuff, he's so cute and it hurts to see this.
I love seeing that the slushee cup graduated from infomercials to TikTok haha
read the book you got it looks so good

It’s only getting banned in America but I live in the UK so it’s fine. I can still go on it even though I don’t go on it. My mum goes on TikTok and she’ll be very happy. I don’t like to talk because it’s not for kids and anyways, I don’t really like it.
Where did the nails come from?
Can you show us an updated leggings tour ,Hi Hope I am such a fan and I've been watching you content for three years and I love you content so much <3👖
Hey beautiful just wanted to politely and with respect let you know how incredibly dangerous it is to give your dog anything gummy, chili powder and lemon lime as these things as well as sugar and salt can cause serious digestive issues, seizures, organ failure and possibly death so I just wanted to let you know. I love your videos and most people don't know the dangers of most foods and if you don't know just one grape, prune or anything made out of grapes can cause death as well and peanut butter made with xylitol just love your videos and iI see how much you care for Leo and I'm sure you want him to be healthy & safe he is so adorable
Rip Kobe bryant
Ong i love that plant and ghost blanket! So jealous! How much did it cost?

You you white almost blinded me
I understand why you made this video shorter because most people probably don't want to watch an hour long review, but you're so entertaining that I'm honestly sad about so many products that get skipped over during this video. Also I'm broke so I'm living vicariously through you 😅 I need an hour long version of this video please 🙏❤
❤❤❤
👍
I am LITERALLY astounded at how many by times you LITERALLY say LITERALLY.  Erroneously I might add. It LITERALLY makes me cringe.
That lounge set is a little expensive but it was like 50 40 $that would be nice
Why does she look like Taylor Swift in the wildest dreams music video 3:50
She looks like katie Perry with black hair!
But… do you know all those products are in Temu and AliExpress for les than a half of the price, Right?
I think that the edible paint is marketed edible but its not meant to taste nice. It might be incase your child is using it or something else like that!
I heard Roblox music in the background of your video
❤😊
I would have put the Ghost blanket in first palce
The wig reminded me of the Adam's Family. New acting career 😉
This vinegared cucumber pickle is such a joke in comparison with ndian pickles... Spicy, juicy, flavorful and made with a various kind of fruit and vegetables and other stuff.... 😊😊

A few days before my brother’s birthday we had a big Brownie because one of my grandparents wasn’t gonna be in Victoria he will be in South Australia and the candles 🕯️ we put on the brownie the flames 🔥 were different colours
DONT FEED YOUR DOG CANDY. Jesus christ, do people seriously not understand how dangerous this is?!
Hi hope you are my favourite YouTube ever I am from Scotland
It’s really bad to feed your dog spicy sweets. Once is not gonna kill him but make sure he doesn’t get anymore ❤
Where did the birthday cake body oil come from? TIA
I love you, Hope! But it’s like nails on a chalkboard every time you say “these ones!”
💓💓💌💯💯💯💯💯
I have a different astronaut But it's still a night light
I NEED links for the blood cup NOW!!!!😍😍😍😍
Tell me you e never made icecubes without telling me you've never made icecubes 😂😂
I hate the fringe in the pink dress! It doesn't fit! Would have been a 10/10 without it, tbh!
Love the video idea but I would have been 💯 more on board if you had slowed down and actually reviewed everything! Nothing wrong with a long video or a 2 part! Would definitely liked to have had more opportunity to actually see and understand and get a review of what all you bought!🫤
8:53 U HAVE NEVER TRIED THEM THEY ARE SO GOOD LIKE WHAT
2:28 you know mother like son
hey, Hope, I love these videos so much but I couldn’t help and notice all the waste that’s generated by these videos. You probably have a very young demographic, the majority on TikTok just based on the types of videos you make and they’re very entertaining I think it’s important that you educate the youth about plastic pollution, especially the state of the world that were in. we are literally in a plastic pollution crisis, so I think it’s important that you made me out of that, and bring awareness to it. Especially with the platform that you have ❤
What is the name of the account of the brushes that were in the first place?
Girl she looked like Katy Perry in the black wig
Why at 1:16 hope has a pink dot on her hand then for the next product she doesn't ❤😂  Like this comment if u saw it to❤ love you all  👇👇
Love all your videos ❤❤
Leo i love his reaction
My favorite part was watching you figure out ice cubes!! So fun :D
For the expensive sweaters that come from clothing print shops, if the shop is an actual small business then they have to charge that much for individual orders if they’re going to make a profit. The only way for you to really get a deal is to buy bulk. Plus, a lot of small business print shops make the print screens by hand and spread the design by hand too (automatic machines cost a buttload). That kind of repetitive work is really tough on shoulders so their price (if they’re smart) will also help set them up for future medical bills when they inevitably destroy their shoulders. My aunt and uncle own a clothing print shop and they once broke down their finances to me while explaining their prices.
What was the name of the perfume?
I would've liked a link to a few of the products... like that eye makeup stick that give you different iridescent colours in one stick... but other than that, it was a good video.  As for the hair... I don't think completely hot pink hair look all that good. That's just my opinion.
She put on the wig and looked like Katy Perry
I wanna rewrap my Jeep HopeScope Pink.
Love how she was exited for icecubes
Die hard black hair
Swify’s make me sick 🤢
that birthday cake body oil looked really cute, but you never told us what the brand was and i would like to get some for myself, and i don't really know where on tiktok to find it, so if you could  can someone please tell me where to find it at?

OMG Jonny Cakes! My precious try boi.
HOPE I SUBBED
I like everything  but it's probably so much money
I wouldn't eat any product or use makeup because there is every chance it's toxic as dropshipping  & no proper regulations.  And clothes often won't tell you the cheap composition of fabric.  This was fun though
I hate the her sore if im bien a bi rood
Where did she buy that Taylor Swift flag I want ittttttt !!!❤❤❤
Can someone tell me where to get #33?
The watermelon gummies are actually being resealed I think they are made for haribo a gummy bait line😅

I think your wrong about TT shop items have to be in your country.  I just bought my first item, took a month to get and came directly from China !

WYERE R THE POPPING PEARLS FROMM I WANNA BUY IT..
What shop did you end up getting the wig, #12 from?
Well if you do a little bit of girl math with the more expensive clothes, you will more than likely get at least 20 wears out of them. For example, the leather pants which were $72. $72 divided by 20 wears is $3.60. So it’s 3.60 per wear.😉😉
Girl, I’m the same Taylor Swift fan so no one’s blaming you to be a Taylor Swift fan
I’ve seen this video about 5 times 😂
"slay" - average gen alpha girl

Dogs can't taste spice
That dog is disrespectful 😂😳
Really not smart to give a dog chilli... Dogs cannot eat spicy foods as they can upset your dog's stomach and lead to long-term health problems. Even if he wants to eat something, you should check it first and be responsible.
I love your videos
Love it so much
she didnt actually buy 100 she was skipping numbers but i love her and leo
tajin isn’t spicy AT ALL
The watermelon gums are from my state * Brazil *

Look again is so good. It is what got me into Lisa Scottoline. Another book I love by her is every 13 minutes. She is one of my favorite authors.

24:00 is disgusting
Try this vanilla lavender slime/aromatherapy dough 🙏
That dog in the shot constantly is so distracting jeez
Does anyone know where the oversized blue with stars shirt is from?
I adore you Hope.  I beg you and all people to stop using the word “literally “ unless you use it correctly. It is maddening. Please , please, please, use the word literally correctly. If you do maybe your followers will use the word correctly as well. Lastly, you are so very generous with your donations and to your subscribers. I’ve never seen someone in your age group be so generous. I understand how creating content works, viewing works and getting paid, etc., but you choose to be generous in the end and I so appreciate what you do. I love your cargo videos and other zany bids on stuff returned.  You deserve to go back and get the tennis bracelet. I was taken to the emergency room by ambulance and in the ER the nurse took my jewelry, clothes, etc., and stole my diamond drop necklace. I had to sue in small claims court to get my money. I did win but the money went to pay the hospital bills. I was angry and refused to pay the hospital until they returned my necklace. I ruined my credit (this was years ago), paid the bills, learned my lesson. I bought the diamond necklace because it was for reaching a goal of trying to get a muscle in my leg to work which took years to reach and then earn the money for the necklace. That was why I was crushed at this nurse ripping me off. The hospital’s lawyer said,” don’t were expensive jewelry to the hospital.” The Judge stated that when one is in a car accident one can’t swing by one’s house and drop off the jewelry. My next goal was a tennis bracelet. I reached that medical goal on the same leg/knee. The tennis bracelet turned out to be crap diamonds. It was heartbreaking. The handsome Englishman in the fancy suit scammed me. I did make him test every diamond in the bracelet to prove that they were real. Cloudy diamonds. He said I could have a one carat that was better than the two carat so I switched bracelets. It turned out to be crappy too plus no money back when down sizing either. Bone head mistakes in my youth.  Go for your tennis bracelet if you think it is good diamonds , Hope. You work hard, make so many of us laugh at your antics and that is why you should have the bracelet of your dreams. I still think about the what if with my bracelet. Cheers!!!
i loveyou
at 25:42 the candle has a wood holder wood can get set on fire🤣🤣
the crystals are supposed to go in Moon water you put them in the rain and let them sit overnight
O God love it she's never used an ice tray 😮
The book will be really good. Lisa Scottoline is one of my favorite authors. I have quite a few of her novels. I LOVE your hair!

Be very careful giving your dogs non canine sweet products as some contain Xylitol which is highly toxic to dogs and can kill them in hours.
7:02 I have that note book
I already sub howe do i now look how you gonna let use see what ure gonna do with it
I have the slushy cup lol😂
I was so excited when I saw the cake kit from Jonny Cakes! I love him! 🥰
Jonny is actually one of the players on the is it cake show
Those cups that 'make your drink into a slushie'... have been around since I was a kid.  I had one.  Maybe they are better now (I certainly hope so)... but I am old AF and those things are not new at all.  We're talking 60s and 70s here people.
POV: we all scroll to the end to see her hairrr 😂
The shiny pink dress looks like a dress Taylor would have worn I the “ME!” Music video❤
The candle reminds me of the blue flame candle

Wellllll now you have a full country look with the boots to add with the top, wrangler bag & jean skirt you got on the lost packages video 😄
Fini candies are owned by the worst scammer in Europe. 🤬🤬🤬Please do not buy it again and spread the word!
What an awful name ....gushers😂 K from UK ❤

I have been scouring the internet to try and find what the name of the perfume she got was
Why is Tiktok in US expensive. Ours are around $10. 😅
The. Edible paint is very good for my sister because she loves to eat paint
Hope do u happen to have the link for the Nike AirPods shoe case?? My son would love that
Have it in "purse"on, haha
Do you have a room just full of stuff? You order alot of things, its gotta add up after awhile.
The Thai Constellation plant is TOXIC TO ALL PETS...if you get this you DO NOT need pets!!!
You didn't give the name of the shop with the colored flame candles! And I NEED a couple!
As a dog person- I can tell you they don’t feel spice!
Madison and Mallory is a boutique who belong to a pair of sister YouTubers! Can’t remember their name though
Wow that sparkly looks gorgeous on you Hope ! Looks like something Meghan Trainor would wear in the Made You Look music video
Can I have that wig because that's my dream wig lace front in Christmas
I loved the Halloween town sweatshirt 😻
The TikTok shop prices are sooooo off 😮 itsjust Amazon or sheen quality to me….
The watermelon gum is French brand and I got them from New Caledonia ( It’s a French Island )
Tku!! I seen couple things I been thinking abt getting.  I'm get a couple of them now.
The ghost - monstera blanket is something i would sacrifice a month worth of groceries for. Not my dogs, but definitely mine.
Edible paint for cake and candy decorations

Katie Perry vibes with the wig. Love it on you.

Honest opinion: you look the best with just Blonde hair without all that other stuff ❤
you should wear the white boots with the sparkly dress
Hey please be careful with spiced or any flavoured food. Citrus is lethal for pets. I know cats can die from lemon. I would probably say the same is applicable for dogs.
THE WAY SHE SAID SKWINKLES 😂😂😂😂  it’s pronounces (s-queen-kleh-s) which means isn’t a real word but 99% sure it’s a play on escuincle which means kid but used more like punk
Bro said mine name😅😅😅😅 not Capri not capri😅

I love Johnny Cakes ❤ especially with the tryguys lol
I just got that astronaut off TikTok shop for 8$, everything at this point just comes from some sort of Ali express factory and then is sold on amazing for more and then sold by other people for even more it’s all a scam

I love how leo jump in the couch,take the toys and run 😂😂😂
Where are the wigs from
I dare you to start a dare or dare series  Who else agrees 👇
I really liked the boots and I understand that maybe having the white boots stand out more, but I think they would look better black.
I had the frozen magic cup and i only got to use it one time, the second time i used it it busted 🫠 super salty tasting

The edible paints are for decorating cakes, fondant figures, chocolates/candies etc. They're not really there for flavour, just aesthetic (like edible glitter). I've seen the metallic and iridescent ones used to paint mermaids' tails and unicorn horns on birthday cakes.
I love the sparkly dress
You did not do 100 items 😢
Can be please recognise the pink sparkly box cutter?

The brown hair makes you look like a Elena from the vampire diaries 3:49
She went throught the five stages of grief eating that pickle. 😂
Plz don’t give your dog those😭😭😭😭😭

the music is a little bit too loud at times, i had a hard time understanding you at some points :)
WHERE DO YOU GET THE CRYSTAL CANDY FROMMM I can’t find anyyy
i love how the doggie is reacting to things and engaging with hope, never stop including him 🥰🥰
Are you worried your nails are going to pop off or what is going on with them?
Anyone know what perfume #92 is?
Love it
I don’t know what hair dye you use, but have you ever tried Brad Mondo’s brand XMondo? He has Super Pink and a new pink, Rhodolite.
No real insult to her as a person or the viewers, but who in the world would spend their time watching a girl buy random products and not even really take a deep dive into any of them? Not a single topic like make up or wrinkle creams or clothing lines, but a superficial brief display of random purchases.  Viewers PAY her for shopping, giving her the money she is shopping with! Its like a group of people going to the mall with a total stranger and just buying whatever she wants, every day. Why not do something online for society, the planet, the sick, the homeless, or animals in need?
Okay but I checked insta where is this advent calendar!?!
Was that potpourri or like botanicals you mix with gin? 🤔
lol i went to teen nutcraker try outs and the teacher was wearing the pickle sweatshirt
I like the astronaut galaxy night light.
That brownie butter is legit! Try the cake batter one! It’s like eating vanilla cake. Got mine at Target!! It’s so good!!!!
I think the edible paint is actually edible, but used incorrectly, it's more like a cake icing pigment/paint.  Either dropped in and mixed into white icing/frosting for cakes, painted, or sprayed (diluted) on an iced/a frosted cake with white icing/frosting.
I feel like Hope with black hair will look like Jade from Victorious. 😂🩷 she would look identical! 🩷💜
Can I have some makeup products or skin care
That slushy maker is SO OLD. I remember this also hit the market 10 years ago when I worked at a toy store 😂😂😂
I love your videos!!!  So much fun.  Hey, where did you get the Crystal Candies from?
I love your videos I made my whole family subscribe to you and hang with hope-scoop    I love Leo and how he takes everything😂😂
The only reason for the high prices is bcuz it has to be higher than what it actually cost so they can buy more stuff for their products
Those sparkly boots would go amazinf with the white sparkly dress!
go to canadian tire for a co2 can❤
Hi
Ty for giving us the shop names had to purchase some of these things
oh shoot i have totally been eyeing that Wrangler purse lol its cute!
LOL I remember those slushie cups from as seen on tv back in the early 2000s
Drink everytime she says literally:  Everyone: ☠️☠️☠️
I definitely bought the ice tray off Amazon!
I just have anxiety about all the waste this creates. I’m feeling confident you are not irresponsible.
That dress at 6:05 is giving me barbie vibes
Im loving the sidekick he's so cute
are the sweets from th begining of the video inspired by the sweets from jimmy newtron?
0:33 we saw that! You spoiled the next video 😂
Leo was such a cute side kick through this.  ❤
Hey HopeScope I just wanted to introduce you to this small business from YouTube shorts. She makes hand made purses which are so beautiful 😍, the channels name is MSN craft
If you don't want the purse I'll take it haha
Omg I love unicorn gang! They’re my favorite liquid lipstick!
If u don’t want the wig I’ll gladly take it😭🤌🏽
bro noooo where was the wig frommm ??!???!!!! 😫
Hope is so pretty
Gurk why are you kinda addicting?🤨 I can’t stop watching
I’m in love with the Wrangler bag!!! It’s a Pendleton inspired bag!! They have several other colors with slightly different patterns!
I live in Norway and can i buy from Amazon? Cuz in your other video i want a lip gloss thing and i want it soooo..... Can i ?
No don't like the pink hair
I don’t know how much she paid for that mat pink lipstick she put on to demonstrate but I just received the same one from Temu yesterday for like $1.15 LoL. Unless what she bought was an actual brand and Temu is duping it? I actually ran to my bathroom to look at the outer case bc it looked so familiar and sure enough, same design. It’s actually a long lasting lip color, I was impressed for that price.. but it’s crappy if someone on TikTok is selling it for $15 or whatever, that’s a massive profit but not very honest. It’s legal though so you have to be careful to check product prices, just like her little astronaut was half the price she paid on Amazon. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Lisa Scottoline is one of my favorite authors.
Um Hope I thing i have the same nails as you 🤭
Am I the only one who really wanted her to review the unbrush?
DUDE !! Let me know if that stupid beard- hair - cleaner- upper works !  I’ve been eyeing one for my guy for weeks now ! 😂
Hope looks like jade from victorious with the dark wig
my sister literally got the exact same ranger bag
🏩🏩🤟
I love hopes hair
*The Wrangler bag is authentic* It has the actual Wrangler logo and the Wrangler tag *I want the whole complete set in the lavender color!* 🤩💜 There's only one company that sells it on Tik Tok and they have a video/videos with the designer of the bag
My mom has those shoes 👟👟
Why the hell are the AirPod holders on the podium
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 slay hope
The pink sparkly dress reminds me of hairspray! So cute 💗
Have you heard the phrase, "everything old is new again"? There are so many things that you bought that came out when I was a kid. My sister and I had the slushie maker cups back in the 70's. I'm 57, btw. Eevrything old is new again.
I have those really soft slippers they feel hard but when you compare them to other slippers they are softer
OMG HOPEEEEEE YOUR HAIR IS LOOKING AWESOME ALL PINK 🖤

Okay but the silver gown looks amazing on you

Anyone finds it funny that she unboxes ACOTAR merch and right after, edible paint? 😂 *If you know, you know*😂
I’m in love with the wrangler purse 😂
I relly would wish that you could lower the music 😢❤
Do you know like it does rugs Do you like the bloody 1 like if you have something wet and then you get on it I like put blood on it
I won't lie I wish she actually put the slippers on because I have some like this and they're way more comfortable on. Lol
She low camera fame typa shiiiz
It’s actually a lace front thank you very much
I really love your videos ❤
i need to find these links!

JOHNNY CAKES!!!
I'm pretty sure dogs can't taste spice!
We LOVE slime community baking kits.  Their slime is such high quality and my daughter plays with the slime LONG after the initial projects.
I bought the wrangler purse on TikTok shop and got sent a knock off. It didn’t even say wrangler. I literally cried real tears when I opened it. Very sad. 🥲
you can buy the stuff to make a drink into soda at bed, bath and beyond. my dad has one and we have had it for years
beard trimmings off the KITCHEN sink? lol but my hubby needs one of those.
Great video but I wish the product brands all got mentioned/@ed cause there’s some things I would buy if I knew where they were from. A master list would be amazing
HOPE I BOUGHT THE ICE MAKER FROM ONE OF UR VIDEOS I LITERALLY LOVE IT!!!
I'm obsessed with the monstera leaf and ghost blanket!!! 🤗
The Suriel hoodie 🥰 love to wear iykyk clothes 😅
Noooo take the brushes out of first there so cheepy

Love the pink hair
Nice shirt
The perfume you tried out near the end of the video really caught my attention because my name is Yasmine 😂😂😂😂
tysm hope for reviewing my moms product <3. ❤❤
But you definitely slept with it too
Slay without pink hair
I’ve been curious if the tiktok shop was all just a bunch of drop shippers or if there were legitimate small businesses… good to know there ARE small businesses on there! Hope they up their coin from it 🎉
Nice
13:40  it looks like baby clothes
Is it just me, or did it skip number 3? I saw 2, then it was 4?
Those sour gushers had my mouth watering! I need some!
That instant slushee maker was for sure an “as seen on TV” product when I was a kid.
Super
I love all your videos
The suriel sweater 🩵 I love it, to anyone who hasn’t read that book or even doesn’t read. This is the book that got me into reading!! I hadn’t read since book reports in high school and now I’m in love with it, you’ve just got to find the right book. But this one is a favourite (fantasy) of most booktubers 💖💖
Got my son the astronaut for $15 from temu
Waoo thats a very good one.
This is perfect entertainment while smoking a doobie
My favorite is Selena Gomez.... FOR THE BAGGGGGG!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
What breed is Leo?
The dog is definitely Mexican
"Oh! And maybe some chili powder." me: *Eats spicy noodles* And I'm also eating Chester's flamin' hot fries.

THAT PINK LOOKS *SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO* GOOD ON YOU!!!! OBSESSED
Hope love I think with the edible paint it's not actually meant to taste good, like the aim isn't to just eat it, I think the company's aim in making it edible was so that it would be safe to use for children!
I have exclusive offers

Hope, I am new to your videos and loving them. Just wanted to let you know that hand embroidery is easy and fun to learn. I have been doing it for a while and I love it. Its like drawing with thread, is wonderful creative therapy and a great hobby to take with you. I have taught beginner classes, let me know if you need help, of course I am sure there are some video tutorials out there. 😉
The best was definitely the round ice

That Lisa Scottoline book is excellent,  all of her books are. I got ice ball trays exactly like that on sale on temu for 8 cents 😂. I like that granola butter, my husband is addicted to it.  I also got the Dino chicken nugget pillows 4 of them for like 10 dollars somewhere. I loved the ghost/plant blanket.  Most of the stuff was just over priced wish stuff but some of it was good.
The sparkly dress reminds me of Taylor Swifts Me! dress
I was watch this then there was an add for tiktok shop 😂
I haven’t watched in a while because so many people do this same content.. I really wish you would sprinkle in some legging reviews.

Is Leo getting enough attention? The whole video he kept trying to get in frame! 😆
Hope I can literally watch you do anything! You are one of my comfort channels.💘
I think all pink hair washes you out. The color is too strong for your complexion. I liked you with the pink in front, and the rest blond better. I love your hair curled.  Hope I can literally watch you do anything!💘
you can bye the co2 at walmart
I LOVE THE SURIEL ONEE
the stones are for witchcraft
I love your hair dark! Especially back in the older leggings day. Yea, Im an OG. I've been following for years. ❤

Look again is great! I read it several years ago
Im sorry i didnt know that the pink hair would be in this video
Cherish the soursop leaf! Its getting harder to find!
Did he say clean up beard trimmings off the KITCHEN sink???? NOOOOO
Omg I had to comment this because that suriel sweater was just everything 😖 I want that so baddd. Love the reference ❤
I love the bedazzled knife cutter ❤
So the thing about the robot, the original seller obviously added it to Amazon but Amazon forces sellers to put down their cheapest total. Soo that actually might be the original price. Or it legit just could be a scam 😓
Where can I get the Starbucks cup?
I absolutely love your videos! I’ve been binging videos for the past 2 days when I get home from work I am all about the honesty on your reviews and I love how excited you get on the good finds!
The consumerism is crazy

If you want anything Halloweentown Kimberly Brown has her own Etsy shop.
I used to work in a candy shop. While I was there we got rid of the ice cream machine so my boss let me take home all the big boba bins like that. I ended up with 4 flavors, I was in heaven for a week until I realized I had no place to put them :/
13:07 STOPPP MY HISTORY TEACHER HAS ONE 😭
You posted a video to get designer bags that were confiscated. Where did you do that? I’m interested In it. Come up on the LV!
Wait... I watched this whole video to see one of those tiktok crystal dragon egg things that are all over tiktok and she didn't even get one?! Really? 100 items and not 1?! 😢😮
Xylitol in sweets in highly toxic for dogs. Never wanna see that again.

i love leo he is so cute.
I love 🥰
She's really a sucker for sparkles
Hope you should do a selena gomez haul of outfits she's worn and her makeup line
THAT ROMPER!!!😍😍😍
I've been making my own vanilla for years.  I buy my beans from Amazon, use mid-quality vodka and you have vanilla.  It does have to sit for several weeks in order to steep but it's so much more economical than buying vanilla extract and it lasts forever.  I usually pour the vanilla into a different bottle and pour in more vodka.  The beans will last awhile.  The taste is amazing.  Once you make something with homemade vanilla, you'll never buy it in the store again.
Whats the brand of the tshirt dress with stars???
I really love your channel.  😊
Anyone else surprised how she didnt get the beachwaver! Its been all over my fyp!
I love your blonde hair
I love your blonde hair

Does Hope realize that K-Beauty has been doing those sunscreen cushions for a LONG time. Lol. 😅
Video is very amazing.your hair is so cute.I love hopes smile, energy and dedication to making awesome videos for us.
I’m weak at you getting the black girl magic wig!! 😂😂😂😂 I get those ads all the time (I’m a black girl lol)
Those pickle kits are so insane to me! I come from South Texas, so everything in that kit sells for less than a dollar to less than $5 each. It's really cool to see them become a trend! I've been surrounded by those candies all my life so I found it eye opening no one knew what any of that was before the kits became popular. 😂
Where is that advent calendar?    Does she gave anywhere where links to things are listed?
the wig is from BGMgirl hair
The plump & pout you’re suppose to wait 5-15 min to see the difference   But once the sting goes away your lips go too lmao
Scrolled for so long in the comments and didn't see anyone talking about Johnny Cakes... like what?! Hes amazing and a series regular now on the Try Guys.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE NEW HAIR!!!😍🔥💖

THE PINK HQIR?
20:32 They go with 18:45 :D you should wear them to a taylor swift concert or something xD
When she went to the bathroom and the kitchen the dog always follows her😂😂
i love hopeee
I think the edible paint might be meant for toddlers that still put everything in their mouth, but wants to paint haha. Don’t think your meant to just eat it for the taste😂🎀
Why is her dog soooooo cute😭😍! He is so curious and look at the kind face! What’s his name?
The quartz confetti is great in a clear jar or vase with some fake plants! I mix it in with cheap rocks from the dollar store that are clear so it sticks out.
oh, consumerism :(
Barbie❤
Ooo im not a fan of the glass nail file 😅 i can get them at shoppers in Canada and it just doesnt last longg
Can u do a haul on moschino? I really want to know how good this stuff is
Nooo the dog took a Crystal bead I hope it didn’t eat it 😮
This video was so good. but the pink hair doesn't soot u
I think I need that edible paint because I eat normal paint  by accident to much
I love your videos they are so interesting 😊
DONT EAT THE SOURSOPP LEAVES OR TEA I WAS GONNA DRINK IT THEN I GOOGLED IT ITD SOOOOO DANGEROUS PLS GOOGLE IT AND DONT DRINK IT!!
I'm a million% against waste....  Mother-in-law will eat the outside of a pickle and throw away the rest... the center is the best part!!!!
lol the editor gave up counting the items half way the video
What’s the name of the perfume ? I really want to buy it 😂❤
That Eyeshadow really made your eyes pop, I am loving the illusion of two colors in one swipe.
It’s giving Katy perry in a good way when she put the black wig on
The wig made you look like Katie Parry
I have the same astronaut

I need to know where the body oils, $3 nails and the jasmine dragonfruit perfume are from ASAP please! 😅
I hope you didn’t give up on the cloud slides! You sometimes have to warm them up first. Mine came with instructions. I absolutely love mine!
We use soursop leaves in the Caribbean for helping sleeping issues as well.  We eat the fruit, make drinks etc with it. It's yummy. I think the Hispanic community uses it as well. They call it Guanabana
My brother has that light the one u have beef with he loves it and we got it from amazon
that watermelon gum is a candy from Italy and i lived them bc my dad is in the military  and i would go to the pool at get that from concession it was amazing

Not sure if it's just me but it seems like the background music volume is a little bit louder in this video than usual and is kinda distracting from hope talking
Hope doesnt know who Johnny Cakes is?!?😮
This was fun. I hope you do it again. Some of those things, though, I have seen or even purchased on Temu (the eye shadow stick I bought).
Cool I love it
Cool I love it

Thank you for being so positive you make my day better 😁
HOCUS POCUS

Anyone know what small business on tiktok the makeup brushes are from ?
What happened to you dieing all your hair pink
Hiii Hope, great video (as always) but the music in the background was a little bit too loud for my taste and
Hope just always makes me smile. She is so pretty and kind! Can we just admire the effort she puts into her videos?❤
Great video, love so many of these items. The prices on tiktok shop in America is crazy though! Much cheaper where I am. The candy floss is cool but I understand the hate they get because that’s insane price for some candy floss 😳
I NEED THE WRANGLER PURSE 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😍
Hey Hope! I would love that wig.
He’s ok isn’t he
I love ur vids but chillys aren’t good for dogs 😢
I love how you let "Actually I don't hate it" sound like a good review! 😅 But I'm really confused why you get the price point of the potpourris! Aren't those just 12 tiny basic potpourris with 1$ worth of ingredients each?
The music is so loud in the background what is going on 😂 love this video though
I love the different blind date with a book shops, but you say it's packaged cute and it's prob the least cute I've seen lol
Hope guess what my birthday days tomoottow 😊
I love the Thai constellation! Such a beautiful plant ❤ 🪴
My daughter has and loves that astronaut. It makes a great nightlight.
HOPE YOU SHOULD DIE YOUR HAIR BLACK WITH WHITE FRONT HIGHLIGHTS you would slayyy it 😍❤️🤗 if you agree like it up @hopescope
Why is no one talking about her hair dyed all pink. She looks absolutely stunning 🤩
❤❤❤
That looks like an Variegated Albo Monstera plant and I paid through the nose to get my boyfriend one for Christmas BUT! It’s had like 5 new leaves, it’s grow 2 foot and it’s glorious ngl 😅🌱  But yeah, you’re going to get some very jealous plant lovers 😆
WE GOR PRIME BOY'SSS

I love how you review small businesses. I hope to be on your channel one day when I start mine.

I had my son a month ago and they literally had one of those astronauts in the delivery room 😂
I just imagine
Swiftey
I waited so long for you to bleach the pink and now everything is pink 😫 So sad 😢
Does anyone know the name of the shop the cowboy boots came from?? They're sooo cute!!!
Hope: just eatting food Leo: FOOD I HEAR FOOD? *takes* *one* leaves.. EW WHAT IS THIS?? OH WAIT ITS ACTUALLY GOOD!  ❤💞
Chamoy gushers?
Our TikTok feeds are so different. I think I’ve only seen about 3 of the things in this video. About 90% of my TikTok Shop ads are Taylor Swift 💖
heeyyy, i have been a huge fan of your channel for over a year<3 i'm starting my own beauty buissnes soon
If you’re still in the halloweentown mood, I just got my “Marnie” adult joggers from the company Little Bird Bamboo, they will have their Halloween ready to ship stuff this week. They’ve got lots of good ones… halloweentown inspired, hocus pocus inspired, scooby doo inspired, a gem print, and “boo at the zoo” which is a bunch of animals in Halloween costumes. Highly recommend looking into their shop because they’re great. Owned by a military family and bamboo pajamas are something else. I love getting family matching bamboo sets for my son and I. It’s kinda pricey but they’re so soft and comfy, I’ve spent thousands on bamboo this year 🥴
buy lap band surgery
When you start to pay too much attention to the background and can tell that these clips are not filmed in the order shown, because the 2nd place item does not consistently match the one we last saw being in 2nd place. 20:17 the gushers get dethroned by the gold glitter body oil, and then immediately go back to being gushers.
That monstera leaf and ghost blanket is everything !!!!!
Girl there’s no wayyy you got a pre-plucked and pre-bleached wig from the TikTok shop😩😩give it away
The ghost/leaves throw blanket looks like it would be the blanket Blanche Deveroux would use to decorate her bedroom for Halloween on Golden Girls.
8:40 im addicted to that candies in brazil
Nice
ACOTAR apparel?! this is getting out of control, but I am all here for it 😂😂
4:13 I need that shirt for Adam Sandler day
Ok but where was the wig from?? Idk if I missed it but I didn’t get the name
I WANNA KNOW WHERE TO GET SOME OF THESE! Like the makeup brushes 😍
❤ I subscribed! ❤
PICK ME PICK ME I LOVE EMBROIDERY 💜💜
Omg i want the brushesss. How do I find them???
Im pretty sure you can get the Co2 cartridges at Walmart, Spencer's, hot topic and a few other places, maybe even online. They might have shipped from somewhere that doesn't allow those shipped or via versa, we're you're at doesn't allow it shipped 💜💜
dont give dogs spicy food! its bad for them! !!!!!
I really like it hope💖💖
How do you get all the money to afford this stuff?
You are so cool
the long live cowghouls shirts a morgan wallen song
Not the ACOTAR sweater, I love that you read those books❤❤
Hope can i have that wig please 🙏🏿
I liked the blonde and pink better ❤ 😢
Ouuu I really want that wig 😂😂😂😅😅
The dino pillow and leo, what a cute duo ❤ leo is such a good boy trying some of the items with you ❤😂 what an amazing video! ❤ love the product ones🎉 starbucks cup wow!🥤 The floof cake omg stop it 🍰 that pickle was huge 🥒🤣🤣🤣
You should wear the boots with the White dress
Lee was definitely interested  and curious about the products.  What a fun video!
love this, those crystal sweets look amazing! its hard to hear you over the background music though! xx😍
I'm new what does she do with all the stuff she bought after the videos?
Save your money and buy an education instead. No one wants to marry an “influencer.” Not even another “influencer.” Rhetorical question: Would you rather marry someone you respect, or a narcissistic, socially-delayed child?
Hi hope love the vids the rest of the comments “ca❤ we appreciate how much she does for us”😂
I’m loving the hair! The darker with the pink is lovely, Tyler may have been right about going darker
❤❤❤❤❤
😮
For a second I thought the tiny shoe for the airpods was going to be a baby announcement!🎉

Leo takes his job of quality control very seriously! ;)
After the candle l got scared of the flash it was a very dramatic scream 😂😂
Ok let's take a moment to thank hopescope for spending here mony to make us the videos

I NEED THAT GHOST PLANT BLANKET
9:27 - I’m really disappointed that you seem so supportive of LGBTQIA+ folks yet you also buy from Chick fil a who have a track record of supporting anti-queer causes.
Her ranking wasn’t right je removes #1 when changing #3 place
I feel like the paint would be great for kids or people with Alzheimer’s. Even tho it doesn’t taste good it would be safe if they accidentally ate it or got it on their face.
Don't waste the wig Tyler and hope yall should be the addems family
As a small business owner I just want to say thank you so much for shopping and appreciating so many small businesses! It really is so helpful.

I swear hope is one of them people who can pull off anything, she looks good in anything she wears, I truly admire her beauty so much ❤❤

How do you find Tiktok shop? Do you just search it? I'm from Canada, idk if it's here yet
i actually don't care
How have you not heard of Sol de Janeiro body mists!!! GIRL. They’re a big brand and everything smells AMAZING. The dark pink is where it’s at 💯
Everything looks SOOOO cheap. Like, the kinda stuff you’d get in a seasonal subscription box because they can’t sell it otherwise. Gross.
Any other people here look at the Taylor Swift flag and think *bi pride flap*
HopeScope I cannot w the music in the background 🫣😵‍💫🥴
The owl plushie is too cute 😭
I'm confused...so many of the items were leagues beyond the rhinestone brushes that appeared to be another drop ship item....
Loved this video!!!! Please can you tell me what account the body glitter was from?!! I LOVE IT! love the  channel!!❤❤ Also love the hair!!!
Btw ur not supposed to give ur dog suger 😊
Not Leo grabbing a fallen rock and taking off with it 😂 I also can’t be the only one who was like 😅🫣🫢 on that ice maker thing

Kylie jenner
Your pooch is the best co-host ever.
I went to Walmart and y found a mini Bradz of a model today
I bought the same astronaut lighting for my room on amazon its exactly the same as yours !!
You can also out your used vanilla sticks in a bottle and do it yourself, so you dont have to buy this 'kit' 😉
Hi!, Hopescope i just wanna know where'd you buy the sour spicy candy hope you respond😊
Hey hope lots of love You literally look like a beautiful marmaid in the pink hair colour 🩷💗😍😅 And thank you very very much you have no idea how beautifully you have impacted my life, you've helped me fight depression and all the bizarre demons i was fighting in my brain  There is no word that can describe how greatful I'm to you ❤ I hope i can meet you one day 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Noooo leo can't have the gushers it  spicy bad and sweet with artificial stuff bad    Correct me if I am wrong ain't no specialist. Love ya ❤❤❤💜🩵
I would never give my dog sweets for humans. It's not dog safe at all.
Mostly all that stuff you can get it off of temu and shein
If Hope dyed her hair, she would look like Jessie Vee
it wont let me sign in my instagram 😭😢😥☹🙁😓🥺
Where did you get that wig ?
I really want that slushy cup but I don't have money I really wanted really really really wanted but I don't have money so I can't
I love your vids
I do not have a glass nail file cause I don’t have enough money to buy one
WHERE ARE PRESS ON NAILS FROM??? We need to know!
What shop did the jasmine and dragon fruit perfume come from?
You look like jaclyn hill when you put the wig on!!!
I love Hope, but it’s scary how much waste this all is….
U can get watermelon candy in my country its in every shop
😍😍
LOVE YOUR PINK HAIR!!!!! <333
I have a little shoes and they’re so comfortable you can wear them for at least a lot of hours you can stay in them you cannot walk in them they’re so comfortable in don’t say nothing to TikTok if you don’t like them because definitely buy them they’re amazing😮❤
Britannia, good day package at the beginning from india 🇮🇳 00:30
$98?? Dam… I mean it looks super comfy … I’d say yes if it was $50 for both pieces because the material looks soo stretchy and soft, but $98 … 🫠
The white slides you tossed to the side saying they weren't squishy? Try them on. They are seriously so comfortable. My whole family now wears them!
Love your hair😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Tik tok video nice
I was flabbergasted when I saw your hair
i have read it
Yasss I loved Johnny on is it cake 🍰
Will you add who everyone is? You didn't on some of them, such as the embroidery patterns, and I'm super curious about them. Also, love the content!
Always distressed by "MUMU" cause it's a childrens word for "Vagina" in german 😂
Omg! Chilli is pure poison for your dog! It can lead to liver and kidney failure! As soon as he vomits and has diarrhea, you need to see a doctor as soon as possible!
"i waste my money" "girl i do!?!!" her: .. uhhh
Pink is slowly taking over her head
i really love your videos but the background music is killing me its ruining the video for me..maybe if you turned it down a little bit or idk
are u rich
Oh i wish you didnt rush through the video 😢 would love to see more of the products. But you're awesome anyways! :)
LOVE THE HAIR HOPE❤
Loved the vid ❤
It's looks good but washes your face out, once it lighten up its perfect 🥰
Pu
what's the name for the edible crystals?
omg this is so so so much fun! i love how fast it was. satisfied my adhd brain
I buy off ticktock all the time so good to know some of the stuff I see r real not scams . BUT u shld do a I paid for a item and it was a scam
when i was  akid we had those slushie maker cups, one of the coolest things i owned!
The Wrangler purse is actually real. I saw it on Amazon when I was shopping for a bag for my flight in July.  And Leo with the Dinosaur Pillow. My dog is the same way about them or blankets. Yep. . .she loves blankets. 😅  The Halloween things had me grinning too! My favorite Holiday ever. Plus the Makeup Brushes and Crystal Candy too. Seen several things on here I like. 😊  And who is the Potpourri by?
i love your hair ❤❤❤❤
Omg omg where was the $95 pink lounge set from?!!!!! I NEEEEEEEEEED!!!!
❤❤❤ love, love the new hair color
Love how she always helping out small businesses. She actually cares about people hustling and tbh they are actually pretty good products.
Buy Drunk Elephant and a bunch of skincare and do a haul from expensive to least expensive
Where can I get the  glitter brushes for my daughter , from Ireland 🇮🇪
Love your  😊 dog 🐕 so cute ,from Ireland 🇮🇪 . And your shows 👏👏👏👏
Omg we are hair twins I love it!!! ❤
Piece of advice for anyone tempted to buy the puff sunscreen. To get the actual protection listed, you need about half a teaspoon for your face and neck (this varies between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon dependant upon the dermatologist). The puff will not give you anywhere near this amount, so will not protect you from the sun and I imagine the puff absorbs a lot of the product too.
Hope!!! Don’t drink prime! It’s not good for you at all. I got sick from it and so have many others. Just letting you!❤❤❤❤😊
❤❤😊😊
man i want that lounge set but being single with a 4 year old i dont even have $100 in my account lol🤦🏻‍♀️
Hello Hope, I literally came across your vids just a month ago and I must say I love them, you are so sweet and funny, I love your vids, keep making the vids, you are such a beautiful blessing.🙏🏽♥️
Really ✨
I love ur hair Hope!! It matches u so well 🌹🌹
when are you going to dye your hair pink!!
Does anyone know where I can purchase #33, the Diamond Encrusted Makeup Brushes?
Really hope just give me positive vibes and I love your videos
THIS IS NOT HATE! I really love your videos and the pink hair looks really good but I think your hair looks better when you have the blonde with the pink 😅🥲
I have those ice ball trays. I love using them in cocktails.
Today Lee said hell no I'm youtubing today😂😂😂
Can you drop wig link
I WOULD DIE FOR THAT BLANKET OMG THE MONSTERA LEAFS 😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍 HEAVEN!!!
I watched the video late at night after a long day of testing. I was very tired and was about to per your dog trough my screen. I don't know how my brain managed to make me launch my hand into the screen, break my nail, and realize I'm silly for trying to pet a dog through a screen.  (computer screen is fine)
love it
The Suriel hoodie ❤
Where did you get the press on nails from at the beginning of the video roughly at 5:15?
the sad thing is Instead of opening all the items you buy, why don't you open a few but review until the end, for example like the Halloween box I really want to see everything inside the box😕
Hey Hope, I was wondering if you could please plan a video and review dupes on DH Gate? Please try to fit in lululemon dupes!
If u don’t want the bag I will take it I love wrangler it’s my fav Jean brand bc they are so good to ride horses my dad is a horse trainer but anyway if u don’t want the bag hope reply to my comment pls and I luv u so much
Why haven’t you died your hair yet ?
I LOVE the pickle sweatshirt! Grillo pickles are from MA. A friend use to sell 2 pickles for $1 downtown Boston! Now they are all over the US and the official pickle of Fenway Park! I have my own Grillo merch! Definitely try them if you haven't already. They are amazing! Find them in the deli area of your grocery stop! 💕🌈🥒
I truly wonder how many makeup brush sets hope owns hihi
Jonny Cakes! Love him in his videos with the Try Guys, he has such chaotic energy.
We worry about buying plastic furniture that will never be recycled. He is confident enough to try things that we all have thought about buying but we are hesitant because many unscrupulous traders advertise the product just for money whether it is legitimate or not.
I bought that astronaut for $4
Let’s be real though. How many of those did you keep???? 🤌🏾
Tik toky
gurl the wrangler bag is by wrangler jeans,
My co worker has that wrangler purse !!! It’s so cute !!!
Granola butter is delicious
ummmm you probably shouldnt give that sugary gusher and whatever else is in that to your dog
I'm amazed at all the money she spends on all these goofy things that  I would never buy or even be tempted to buy. I love her enthusiasm and excitement about what's she is getting 😊
Hope please from who did you get the little ghost shirt from
Love that you’re an ACOTAR girl :)
Wait till you try to shop on tiktok here in the Philippines. The price and the quality is just chef's kiss.
Taylor 🔛🔝❤
That gnome from the Halloween advent calendar is adorable. I am obsessed with those gnomes.
Girl, whats the cream eyeshadow stick that lived at 2nd place for a little bit? I've been looking for one that looks more neutral in regular light as the ones I've found have a black base.
Hi hope I love your videos keep up the great work❤️
Sinsearlesupermom
Me wondering how Hope knows what paint tastes like.......😂😂😂😂😂
I loved the sparkly pink dress, the romper, and the matte lipstick!
4:35 4:36
Love to see you make the realistic cake ❤
hope no offence but what's with the music its a little distracting, love you tho
i love how positive and energetic hope is she makes me smile every day
Omg your hair looks great 👍🏻 ❤
Loved this video and I agree some really cool products but some crappy drop shop ones too. Thanks for saving us our money lol Love your hair!
Ok soooo … I’ve been subscribed since day one. I have a merch idea for you… hear me out.. pull overs/ t shirts that say … 😊  “Hopefully it’s Iridescent”
i love the hair
HOPE!!! 1.4M views in one day!!! So happy for you, you're growing insanely fast 💗
I think the astronaut would be SO cute for the background. It matches with the white.🤍🤍🤍 Also, I love your vids!!! They are so fun to watch.♥♥♥
OMG love love love the pink hair. You should keep it pink for sure. 😊
THE HAIRRRRRR 😍😍😍😍💕💕💕
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HER HAIR 😍😍😍
I want the advent calendar
I could swear I saw Leo grab one of the rocks that fell out of the Crystal confetti bag and take off!
I love the white boots they remind me of my childhood were I had a 2nd grade teacher and she loved country music and I got cowgirl boots and a hat an I would bring my hat to school😂
Not me having JUST caught up with ACOTAR and the Suriel tea co hoodie showing up
I like the other hair combo better. The new hair look not my fav on you.
i have the lip stains and i love them
The full on pink hair looks SO good!!!🩷
I love your reviews, but I feel like with how rushed this was, the products aren’t getting a real chance. Like for example, the eyeshadow. I feel like eye make up should have been taken off before applying it. It’s cool that you still like it and all. I just feel like a lot of these products didn’t get a fair chance. I also feel this way about the eyeshadow. I wish it was swatched and the pigment was actually shown to us. By no means am I leaving a hate comment, I love hope and she’s one of the few YouTubers I watch. I just wish some of these products were actually shown. One last thing, please list the small business name for every one of them! I make candles and have a very small business. I know if a creator mentioned my products and didn’t credit me, I’d be pretty upset. Like I said, I’m not leaving a hate comment. Don’t come for me lol
You should try the Boba with pink lemonade
I have that spray (the 68 one from sol de janeiro) I absolutely love it tho 😅
I wanna know where the wig came from lol
Now where pink hair?🤔🤔🤔
OMG YOU JUST BOUGHT A VELANTRIS HOODIE IM DYINGGG

Hope i have been  watching your videos  for 3 years  you are amazing  love you and slay ❤
The pestering of the Shadow Work Journal got me to buy it and its helped a LOT
Which TikTok shop did you get your wig from?
When you said, “that’s nice, huh?” to Leo—so cute! 😍 I talk to my cats the same way—just nonchalant…like they’re _really_ gonna answer me back one day. Lol 🤣🤣     Also, I thought you were dying you *_whole head_* pink… 🤔
Sooooo, are you now a Chiefs fan? 😅😅
When will you dye all your hair pink hope 🤨
You didn't say where you got the crystal candy from:(
I was shook watching to open a bgm wig while I'm sitting here wearing one 🤣🤣 it's my everyday wig I love their hair

Where is the Halloween Calendar from!?!?!
Okay def need a link for those brushes
The wig makes you look a lot like  Melissa Joan Hart ❤ love the whole video!!
You slayed that pink sparkly dress near the beginning! That should have made it to one of the spots on the podium. This was fun to watch.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
You really made my jaw drop when you just did the transition that quick
I love how hopes dog is always part of the video

Can someone pls tell me where hopescope got the 200 nails for 3 bucks??
Granola butter is literally the BEST!!! I definitely recommend the red velvet flavor, it’s to die for🤩
🩷🩷🩷🩷

Love the vids so much can't wait for that pink hair!!!

But love ya😁
We have the same exact slushy cup and put the same drink in it!
Let's just hope you and your husband don't share a bank account.😂😂💀
Waiting for the day you to dye your hair dark/ your natural color 😂
Girl with the black hair wig on you look like Katy Perry
oooh are you going to do an unboxing of the advent calendar?!?!?!
Did anyone catch where the wig was from?
Is any of those TikTok things good for art supplies?
Look Again is one of my favorite books! You will love it!! Lisa Scottoline is a fantastic writer!
maybe u should have brunette hair with pink stripes, instead of the blonde. I think it would look really good
Hi
Holy s**t the hair at the end was stunning! 💕 the brown hair with the pink 😍😍😍 you look beautiful Hope.
Fun fact, animals don't feel spice the same way that we do. I know. 🤯
That glue like "Lipstick" that staines your lips can you bye on almost every Shop like joom or Amazone but in a Pack with five colours or something for cheap 😅 I got them too but not using them actuely
A comment for the algorithm
Im in the middle of watching the video and I just have to add that I wish it was longer! I want to see more :D
Love the hair!!! 🩷🩷🩷
I want that wiggggg😍😍😩😍😍
your hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
okay what is the TikTok shops name for #59 Popping Boba
Love you Hope but sorry I cant with this background music
That dark pink brings out your eyes. It looks good
can we appreciate how long this must've taken for her to do. To find all the items, buy them, wait for them film reviewing it then to edit it. 3-4 months minimum.
A 30 min video from hope???? I love my life
Regardless of price I think the astronaut should have made the top 3 and also the candle was super cool. Just IMO.
Oh man that slushy maker brought back some childhood memories! In the 80s we had some similar, it was a cup and had a inside like liner cup that you freeze and then pop into outer cup, pour drink of choice (always koolaid lol) and then you stir slowly and bam, slushy! I loved it we used them all the time
Hey hope scope i love uso much and i hope. Could meet u one day i love ur pink hair i watched u for a year now
This video tells me that I can put dirt into a bottle, slap a cute label on it, and sell it on TikTok for $30….if, of course, I add free stickers in the package.
My little brother has the astronaut light thing
I can't believe there's nothing like Fini watermelon gum out there.  I'm from Brazil and it's literally the best gum in life, I'm addicted, I'm glad you liked them.
Leo has been SOOO cute this whole video front and center. GREAT CO-HOST! 😄🙂
Hi
This just proves that many "small businesses" on TikTok are dropshippers…
babe how do you get so much money
this video is so exciting
I love your hair 😊
Love the hair!!
I’ll take the vanilla extract 😂🤣 it’s expensive!!!
Her new hair is going to start a new era! ❤
Swifty for life
I love that shirt
When I looked at the subscribe button and I nearly cried I WASENT SUBSCRIBED😢😢     Edit: I don’t wanna be one of those people but- yes I liked my own comment.
I think you look better with long and pink not just pink in your hair
Be careful what you feed your dog please! (I'm sure you do). Xylitol is put in a lot of candy and baked goods (some cheaper peanut butters too). They also list it as birch sugar. The smallest amount can kill your pup.
I was so scared Leo ate a piece of crystal confetti! 😱 he jumped off like he had something in his mouth he wanted to carry off for himself.
There, now I'm done😅
Thank you for shopping on my site
Oh, and love the hair😊
Does anybody know where to get the bloody starbucks cup exactly ?  Please let me know ♥
16:03 - I just bought hairclamps from Kitsch. I love them.
I went《a little》crazy on the halloween theme
THE HAIR YESSSS
Hi, I was curious I saw your video from three years ago of you you had a Leo as a baby and an older dog do you still have that older dog?

I loveee love loveee the pickle sweat shirt !!! I’ve been debating if I should buy it or not but I’m not sure yet 🥹 lmk if you think it’s worth it or if I can get it for another price or something!!
Idk why no one’s talking about it but Hope looks so good with pink hair it looks amazing omg!!!
Be carefull with spicy food and your dog.. they cant tolerate it
So where did you get the wig
I love you supporting small businesses ❤ I have an Etsy shop (Bavarianmama) where I sell $1 cleaning lists to help people with Adhd and depression to keep their living spaces cleaner ❤ it has changed my life so I’m trying to help others change theirs too ❤🎉 I would loose my mind if you would ever feature my shop in one of your videos 😍😍😍

It's so funny how leo took the plushy with out a second thought, instantly😂😂 and im just like instant❤❤
The pickle sweatshirt creator is from my town! I think it's very affordable for a small business!
I got the exact same pack of peel of lip stain on Amazon 6 diffent ones for 3 . 50
I love watching everything you opened! So much fun too watch! I totally agree, the Halloween Advent calendar is # 1🍁🎃🎃🎃
That astronaut light is on Temu for 12$ to 18$ lol I am thinking people buy a lot on Temu and resell
I love watching you
The nails are from shein
Omg it looks so good on you! Makes me want to get pink hair, you are gorgeous! <3
OMG THAT WRANGLER PURSE IS SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!  just added it to my christmas wish list :)
So maybe, the pink dress, the cowgirl boots and the wrangler purse..make it barbie?
27:44 i don't have instagram😢
No cause why do you look so extravagant In every video Hope! And say hi to Leo for me🥹❤️
Why is no one talking about how beautiful her hair is😍😍
Doggy be literally curious in everything. So cute 🥰
2024 Anyone 😂
That pink shiny dress looks great on you.. you should keep it.. Id say the romper too but its too short I agree lol
I have an 👩🏻‍🚀 too and it is from Amazon
Omg I love the new hair is so cuteee but I did love the old hair tho and I love all of the products they are really cool especially the pomegranate and the cake!
Omggg she’s number 2 for trendingggg
Where did you get the bobba pearls?!
I'm so convinced that Tyler is in finance and has found a way to claim taxes on all your videos. So0o much products!
Not me drooling over the wrangler bag and her just being like it’s ok
“Lechuga” 😂 love that!
She is the best❤
I loved the Starbucks cup
The fact she took out the wrong stuff🤣😂🤣😂
I love your videos so much and u also u are so good at reviewing things your are so sweet and kind and preety and also beautiful ❤️🥺
The science is that it's super cold/frozen so the other thing you add also gets cold/becomes frozen. 😂
What kind of strange "look at all the stuff i can buy" video is this?! No substance at all, boring.
I love you TikToker and YouTubeer and you fravit channal please reply🥰❤️🤗
I love hope !!!
love your new hair❤❤❤😍😍
What shop was #33?? I need those brushes now!
First of all SLAY Second of all HA SLAY.
omg, that pink sequin dress looks amazing and looks amazing on you!!
You’re so funny and super beautiful
Please don’t feed Leo human food. Especially if it has chilli on it. Dogs don’t have the same digestive system as us and it could make him really poorly. Sorry to sound naggy.
When hope gave Lee the spicy gummy I was so shocked!! Spicy foods especially chilli powder and tajin is very toxic to dogs!!!
love the hair girly🤍
Do the press on nails ever fall off?
Love the hair omg
The white sparkly dress looks soooo Good on you 🥰
11:48 look how pretty Hope's eyes become when she says "Your missing out!" And then looks at the glass nail file😮😮❤
Love your new hair
I love that pink sparkly dress on you its so cute btw i love your content
I love longer content! ❤❤  I could watch you for hours (I technically do when you do lives haha)
the music is way too loud in this video 🫠
The amount of time , money and effort hope spent on us ❤
I'm already excited for the next video!!!
I love your hair black 🥰
I absolutely ☆LOVE☆ the hair transformation!! I think it was a great call to keep the extended root area a darker brown. It adds dimension and up-keep will be so much easier without having to worry about regrowth. 10/10🎉
the candy pickle product is one of the most american things ive ever seen
7:07 cute but I honestly thought you would go pink , lol
Gorgeous you slayed that hairstyle ❤️❤️
I love how positive and amazing Hope is she actually makes me smile everyday
And love ya hair

People's consumption in a video:

promotion of overconsumption at its finest...
that pink thoooo! love it
Idk what gushers are, but why did she gave it to the dog. 😭
i love that Halloween sweatshirt would buy
The music is very annoying
Nice
yes yes yes 🎉the jonny cakes cameo
Anyone going to mention the Suriel Tea Co sweater? Hope is the first famous person I know that actually knows about it! I was really surprised! 🫖
The "Laced With Cherry" multi-chrome eyeshadow pen comes in all diff colors that shift to other colors.. I think hope got the lightest grey to pink one..
22:46 I thought she was gonna tell Tyler he was gonna be a father.
With the dark hair you look like katy perry 😅
the subtle acotar is giving me life
Most of these items were insanely overpriced.
Hi😅
Girl, what is with your badly photoshopped thumbnails featuring the “deer in headlights” look?
Please sponsor for my baby item...im broke
Watching hope while doing your homework >>>
Had those slushie cups in the late 80s 90s. Brought back good memories.The science behind it is fascinating. It's great to have for hot Australian summers. I remember putting it in the freezer & waiting anxiously for it to be ready. Did this a few times in one day
NEVER give spicy things to animals. Pls. (Or chocolate)
Ahhh! You bought the kit from Jonny Cakes! Love watching him on the Try Guys.
Wait I actually love your hair all pink 💗
Love how positive and amazing Hope is
Did anyone notice Good Day cookies 📦 at the beginning Indians would understand ❤
I would have liked more info about the products she thought were good and not marked up amazon items.  Also, how about providing links to the "worth it" items from the legit small businesses in the description.
👌👌❤️❤️❤️ love your videos
I can't believe how many comments hopescope like. Barely any YouTuber I know does that😜
Not sure if I've read that one, but I love Lisa Scottoline
the music is a bit loud for me T_T
i love your videos.
Spicy things is NOT something dogs should eat..
No spicy gushers for puppy. Might make him sick
I love your videos
8.20 Flash warning to all migraine folks
OKG HOPE I LOVE YOU WITH YOUR PONK HAIR YOUR SO PRETTY
pls be careful feeding your dog anything with spices... it can be dangerous.
THE GOOD DAY BOX AHAHH ONLY THE INDIANS WILL UNDERSTAND
I'm dying for that Halloween blanket it's so up my alley plants and Halloween yessss ❤
Just a heads up, don’t give your puppy fruit snacks. They may contain grape concentrate which is poisonous to dogs.
Omg ur hair is so pinkkk !! Barbie vibes love it!,😊
Hope you looked amazing in everything you tried on, have you lost weight? ❤❤👵👋🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Ok but you didn’t do the hair yourself :((
I did not expect to see Jonny Cakes pop up in this
i have an irrational INTENSE hatred of that pickle sweatshirt
Where was the wig from? I want one I love how the hairline looked!
I love how hope just casually shows us an item for another video and didnt just cut that bit out hehe 💛
I'm only 6 minutes in buy that ROMPER !!! Its so cute 😍
I like your channel so much
Nice lea
If you want comfy squishy slides you should definitely try the mellow recovery slides from crocs best purchase I’ve made🫶🏻
Can u try food from aame mukbang vids pleae!:D
Where can I order the Halloween advent calendar?? 😍
Your hair is wonderful!!!!!!! Looks amazing 🤘💕
The wig❤️
Where are the Hallowen calendar from?😍😍
If yall girlies really like pickles then you should come to Malaysia and have 'jeruk.' They're just pickled fruits, from unripe mangoes, papaya, prunes and other unknown fruits to me.
Obsessed
Why didnt you tell us who that great wig is from!? ..or the nails? Or the candle!! Damnit everything I want!
Does anyone know where I can find the body oil and the perfume? I didn’t see her give the @ for those two
I don't know why but you remind me of Brianna, prestonplayz wife or girlfriend I can't remember
Had fun watching this ❤ sending you love 💕
The black hair had me think of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark and the orange lipstick is also good for Halloween
You know you definitely made it in life when you have people taking time out of their day to watch you  open up items you bought from money you made from people watching you open up items you bought.
The pink glittery dress matches lover era 💗
Dark wig washes you out,
I love the pink hair! Also I need to buy myself that Starbucks cup now it was so cute 😂
My favorite part of the videos is the last one. When you hug Leo and he smiles in such a beautiful way!!!  You can see how much you love each other 🤗  Thank you for the smiles. Love you Hope!
.
I’d love to see you bring @jonnycakes on to use his cake making kit!
woow😍
Okay I need to know where you got the black jumpsuit from. 👀
13:28 need this lamp!!!!!
5:27 don’t fart there will be a bubble
Bro hope's a millionaire
That was the most random stuff I have ever seen. Genuinely confused more about what people want these days lol
me when buying random unecessary products 😂😂😂
Thanks for buying a beverage at Chic Fil A where they donate half of their money towards anti gay rights, ya just lost a subscriber
I liked the podium! you should do top 3 best and 3 worst ones.
Where did you get the Halloween event calendar?!
The boots would look good with the dress
4:47 sunscreen cream must be applied in the right amount for it to work, applying it with just a puff will not give such an amount, it is weak 9:06 You really didn't know these gums?! This is the taste of childhood in our country :v
OH MY GOD the halloween starbucks cup is sooooo CUTEEE i m gonna buy it !!!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ or hell awaits
The pink hair is cute. If you dont agree you can like this video
Favorite YouTuber❤
Sad that people resell. Also so many items from Temu/ Ali. Love the small businesses!!
I love u HopeScope ur new hair is beautiful and I hope u like it to
Hi hope I love your videos unfortunately I can't afford any of these I am going through tough times financially and mentally but your vidz are therapy to me lots of love ❤❤
some firestarters have stuff in them that make them turn blue/green/purple, its all in the science of fireworks and how they get their colors through stuff like copper
Hello Hope, I enjoy watching your videos but I need to know what you do with all of these things. All of the clothes that flopped?? Do you just throw it all out? I need to know because it’s so sad to see people in other countries being slammed with our waste. There is 100 or more tons of clothing piled near by people’s homes. Are you contributing to the negative impact waste has on the world? I say this with compassion I am just worried considering you have definitely bought a 1000 if not more items.
You buy tons of stuff. I was wondering if you have enough place in your storeroom or if you donate those.
She said she don’t think the pickle sweat shirt was worth $44 but if you search on any YouTubers merch stores that’s about the same price you’ll pay for their stuff. So I’d say it’s not too bad of a price for a sweatshirt
I miss the days of svelte Hope working out & reviewing leggings/active wear.
So many awesome products! If I had to pick a favourite, it would be the pickle tshirt. Loving the pink hair!
I miss the days of svelte Hope working out & reviewing leggings/active wear - this ULTIMATE CONSUMER HOPE gig is full of plastic (read OCEAN DEATH) useless consumer items.  Sigh. Bring back WorkOut Healthy Hope.
I can’t believe u pad all this money
I love the hair
Hi hope I made a doll of you because your my favorite youtuber❤
Put your hand up if you have wached hope for 2 hours a day 🖐
Hiii , i know you probably won't see this lol 😂 but i wanted to say thank you, i found your channel when i was going through a hard time and feeling kinda lonely away from my friends, But you really did make me feel like we were just two friends hanging out when i watched your videos, im doing better now but i hopw you know that you're doing a great job at making us fell like we're all just hanging out with you 😊
i think they connect the mini tap to like a little water tank thing or a bucket
I lookkkk gorgeous
I love to watch you do what you do best ❤
you can get this powder to put in a fire and it changes colour  so you can have it in a campfire or something
Omg I need that wig!! I have alopecia and wear wigs full time! I have been wanting to buy a nicer wig! That one looks beautiful!!!
THE HAIR LOOKS AMAZING🤭🫶🏾
I CANNOT BELIEVE U READ ACOTAR LIKE THAT EARNED A SUB that hoodie is soooo good
That is interesting, cause in my placr tik tok is well known as the cheapest place to buy so many things than those shopping platform. Tik tok live. But I don't own a tik tok so, yeah. But, my friends live buying things from tik tok cause they are cheaper. Some are just ridiculously cheap.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Please post the advent calendar on yt shorts for people who don’t have insta (aka me) btw the hair low key look more red than pink but it cute! ♥️
I do think that you were actually holding the important piece of the Soda maker in your unboxing.
Love the new hair color💕🩷
The wastefulness it’s overwhelming not to mention waste of money
Hey hope I loved the Starbucks cup so much was it diy like you could get someone to make it for you to where did you get it from
ASTRO BEAR MAN I HAVE HIM AND I NAMED HIM BOB!!!!
I loved this video but can we just talk about how much the pink hair over made Hopescop eyes just pop. ❤❤❤❤❤
You should buy temu school supplies
She bought all this but wouldn’t buy my song it’s only ten cent damn
Omg can I have that plant!? I’m begging you 😢
Does anyone know what the perfume was??
I think that pink sparkly dress is my favourite out of all the dresses you have everrrr ordered.. it looks so amazing on you!!
Take a shot every time Hope says literally 😂❤
the pink sparkle dress gives me Jem and the hollograms vibes
A wooden candle holder… just think about that for a second 🤔 seems like a fire hazard?
Do video where Tyler buy things
I love the idea 💡 that you can make
Its so funny to me to see the blue and pink liquid lipstick marks on your hands throughout the videos it shows you editing techniques for sure
Is it just me that thinks hope looks SO GOOD with all pink hair
I love the pink hair queen ❤
I love the pink hair! It looks wicked awesome!  My favorite item was the crop top.
One thing I love about hope is that she’s confident enough to try things we’ve all thought about buying but we’re hesitant because a lot of ppl advertise things just for money wether the product is legit or not
Am I losing it, or has she tried the slushy cup thing before? 😅
I want the crystal handled make-up brushes!!
Leo Clearly wants his own video where everything is for him :)
Omg yes
the wig is so cute and I love the pink hair
I love how she view these TikTok adds so we don’t have to do so I love it ❤
Could you possibly post the  Halloween advent calendar  on YouTube too
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ngl, I would've been so mad if you left a dropshipped airpods case on the podium above the other small businesses
I can't believe you bought all that stuff I bet it was a lot of money and I like your videos they are awesome💖💖💖
The acotar sweatshirt ❤❤❤
And Who love hope
I’m like yo… that’s $50 for a T-shirt.
The music is too loud, it's very distracting
I love bajon beauty!!
I’ve been waiting for this video oh my hod yes
10:42 she says it just taste like paint SO SHE HAS TRIED PAINT Idk but not tring to be rude is it true or not????
i just got the kitch barbie clips i love them i have long hair and they work perfect
NGL you look skini IM ABSOLUT NOT SAYING THAT YOUR CHUNKY NEVER EVER I WOULD SAY THAT BUT YOU LOOK ACTUALY SKINI
Broo Sarah spoiling her fans {us) is the best thing❤️I just know the iPhone 15 is about to be so expensive here in South Africa💔and I really wish I could afford it😔🥲I just want to touch one Apple product in my life😊I feel it’ll make me productive as it has the A16 bionic chip🥺but if can’t ship to South Africa, I understand💔
Do I still have a chance at getting a liked comment? Let’s see
My favorite part about this video is that it's longer than usual and I love your videos so much that that's what I want LOL we got spoiled
Pickle sweater? I don’t get it lol
Hiiiiiiiii
I have a feeling that a lot of the tiktok shop stuff are directly from temu
what was in the wooden box? im so confused over that like
Tik tok shop scares me
Where did you purchase the makeup brushes from? They are absolutely gorgeous. I would love to get a set. I know it’s all products from TikTok shop but I am new to TikTok and I have no idea what the TikTok shop is lol is it on the app somewhere as I said I’m completely new to it
This vid is awesome love it and u
The pink hair is gorgeous.😫
Thank you for this video! But I actually wanted to say that it was a little bit rushed for me, I would like to see what enticed you to buy the product (Tiktok video) and how it was in use (like, for example, with nails). I as a viewer wouldn't mind several parts of "I've bought 100 products" or just less products. Once again thank you for your videos!
damn i never saw that much products advertised to me on tiktok :') i would love to see how some of those products do after being used over time
anyone know who makes the color flame candle? she didn't put credit in the video but i want one :3
Your hair is so cute!! Can we all appreciate how Hope does all of this stuff for us and always has a smile on her face!!
Hope when are you ganna dye your hair fully pink
Those shoes are five below style. But as long as your having fun and not breaking your bank. All the editable body stuff reminds me of Jessica Simpson editable line. I miss it cause it all smelled delicious.
love the video🤩
this stuff is so cool and your hair is pretty
nope sorry hope plz stay blond and pink😅
Awe, I thought you were going to make the edible cake bowl of cereal for us!
The pink dress looked STUNNING on you, my jaw dropped when you put it on 10/10.
I love Lee/Leo,😭❤
Hi I'm new and I LOVE your videos so much your the best!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰😊
Why is the music so loud 🤣

Pink hair beautiful...roots awfully long though
If it's not too late I'd like to enter this drawing.  My thing I'd like to try is Brad Mondo hair oil.
What was the eyeshadow stick thing she had?
The background music is so loud 🫣
GIRLLLL you can not just leave us a minute to process that hair change WHAT.   Like I knew it it was going to happen but GIRLLLL THE WAY MY JAW DDROPPED AND STAYED OPEN.
Hey hope love your videos I was was wondering if you want a free golden doodle?
Do a wig try on from ticktock
You should do a part 2 of the tik tok buys
I love this colab video
hold on did it come 2024?
What is the company for the acotar hoodie?? I need it NOW!!!
15:18 you can do that with hard candy as well! I often use minty hard candy and mix with vodka. So nice!
the eyeshadow stick and palettes are multichromes. If you like them just buy an eyescream box or slay glam box subscription. They dispense at least one of these from indi cosmetics companies every single month.
Hope being a SJM fan just made my day
@eleventhgorgeous lol
♥✨🎀The queen has posted🎀✨♥
I really hope that you got that rug that when it’s wet it turns red like blood( btw I love your videos
Me and my son love watching your videos!!! It’s not everyday you find someone on YouTube that all age groups can watch and find enjoyable.
I'm just loving these longer videos 😊😊😊😊
You know when leo is not excited about it than don't eat it! lol
7:31 I have a blanket just like that from that exact shop except it’s a Slytherin blanket and my sister has one that’s marauders map
What company did you get the nails from??
Awe  Super cute stuff !
which shop is the halloween advent calendar from????
I love the collab with your dog
Love the pickle sweatshirt but it doesn't have Dell Dixie or Best Made which are OBVIOUSLY the best pickles EVER !
This Might be too much to ask, a list of these? I know you put up some @ but #84 was kind of skipped or I missed it. Little help?
Obsessed with the new hair and I love these videos of you supporting small businesses! ❤
The wigs make you look like Mortica Adams
Try the mini dill pickles with the wild berry nerds gummy clusters it’s so good ❤
Can we talk about how pretty she is
I love the slime
When she said treats I thought she meant treats for her dog😂😂
My dad gave away my dog so to see Leo made my day 💗
I love her pink hair 😍
I love your videos and I love your hair
Please wear the cheap ball dress and the cowboy boots
don't you like throw confetti around or launch it from cannons? Imagine launching crystals at crowds 😂😂😂
Your hair turned out great but just genuinely curious why you left the roots brown?? @HopeScope
The disappointment of not being picked with your tt shop for Hope to get one of your cups😢:/ 😂 just all the emotions😂😂😂.
I love the way u cutely laugh. I have been fallen for ur smile😩❄✨!!!!! Lots of love from india⛄☁
Is it just me or does the music start to get louder at 8:04 🥺
OMG I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!!!!
I love that dark hair wig on you! It definitely makes your eyes pop
I love how hope literally lets her hair faint to make us content, she deserves a round of applause👏🏼👏🏼
i saw that halloween university sweatshirt on shien for 5 bucks
I love watching your videos and ACTUALLY getting honest reviews on items!! ❤❤
You need to wear the pink dress and the white and silver boots to the eras tour or something lol
Omg I didn’t know you read a court of mist and fury series I haven’t read it yet but I plan to😁❤️
Omg you hair is so pretty
I love her content
Day 3 of asking you to do a video of SHEIN vs Amazon, you you take a SHEIN product and screen shot it and put it in Amazon and see if it’s the same feeling and quality
Hope, you need to get Lululemon slides they’re so comfortable. You should do a video where you buy Lululemon accessories
We got the astronaut for our son from the supermarket for $20 aus 😅 but it’s great! Love the hair ☺️
Hope, that orange lip peel looked so good on you, it brought out your eyes in the best way possible!
Yes
What shop is the wig from ?
Amazing video Hopescope!! I loved watching it :)) 🫶🏽💕🫶🏽
Omgggg you looked so stunning in all the dresses you put on!!!
hope girlll i love when post 💕 ( btw u should def give away that wig to someone *wink wink* 🌚😉😉)
More satisfying than a trip to Target without costing me a thing!
This channel is soooooo addicting!
Love your videos Hope!!!❤ not going to lie though seeing you review products always makes me want to buy them😅  Btw LOVE your new pink hair
The sent 68 is the best perfume ever
I'd love the link to those white sparkly boots and the blue star tshirt dress. Not me eyeing it up as my Eras Tour outfit!
As a plant person, I’m telling you she accidentally bought probably the most desirable plant in the market at this moment. Not cheap either, might I add.
IYKYK ACOTAR!!! ❤❤❤ loooove your channel and personality sooo much. thank you for showing me what I need for my shopping addiction 😂
HOPPEEEE. You are the freakin best. Thank you for being you. I'm a new fan but I've almost watched all your videos. 😅

Hope certainly you woke up at 11:17 AM🎉
hey hope! just wanted to let you know the music's get a little too loud at time
I loved this video hope! So entertaining
Look at bestie hope #4 on trending 🎉
Who else loves her hair
Love the pink hair
Embroidering is so fun! It’s very easy if I can do it you can!
Can you put the song behind louder I can almost hear you… no but tbh i love ur vids but the sound were sooo loud
Cider. Have you done a video about cider? I need to know if it’s legitimate
The hair like OMG
How about just 50 products next time..... that felt like a fire hose Hope.
I ~<3~ your hairrr❤
lolz i bought those round ice cube trays on temu for 10 cents a tray
NO I DONT LIKE THE PINK I LIKE THE ORIGINAL PINK IN THE FRONT I HOPE I GET USED TO IT😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Can u give ur dog gushers...
That was fast and fun.
Tha2t pink dress looks like something  Mrs roper would wear I three Company lol😂
i loveeeeeeeee you`er hair girlyyyy
LOVE HOW HOPE IS SO REAL WITH US
Hope needs to do the Jonny Cakes cake kit with Jonny Cakes. That collab would be 🔥
Omg I love the pink hair, it looks so good on your complexion and they it complements your eyes 🫶🏻🫶🏻
I love your new hair so much 😍😍😍
I find she goes through each one so fast you can really not appreciate or get any kind of review or anything on the products. Would rather see less products and more in depth look at each one.
This is why I don't have tik tok I'd waste all my money 😂
Uhmm
Your hair looks great!❤
I love Granola Butter! You should try their other flavors. Some of my favorites are birthday cake, cinnamon roll, and cookie dough (you have to add your own chocolate chips. I like to mix in the chocolate chips and then refrigerate it so it has more of an authentic cookie dough texture).
Bath sorbet is from my town! They’re great!
Did the dog eat the crystal that fell on the floor or am I literally insane?
Omg I need some to-do sticky notes! I am literally so unorganised 😅.
Dang, that green romper was super cute. Such a shame they made it too short.
22:41 pls the cute embroidered ghost is holding a boba milk tea not iced coffee
The Pickle sweatshirt's print colors look super cheap and washed out and not worth the price
The hair looks amazinggg
I can teach you how to embroider!  It is so much fun and I am self taught❤️
My favourite was the bloody Starbucks cup 🤩
Does anyone remember the game/console for "Dream life?"
You have to try that one perfume that people say smells like a girl with her tts out being fed grapes
Thanks for making another video I love watching you!
98 dollars. No way
I love your videos you make my day and I love your dog
OMG!!!!! I love the hair!!!!
I love your hair you slay anything I’m not kidding and I love you hope
I didn’t think tiktok shop would be big like it is in the UK. The discounts are so tempting, I’ve already spent a lot through tiktok 😂
I don’t have instagram 😢
I love Taylor Swift I know Taylor Swift song she wears short skirts I wear t-shirts she's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Omg the wig is giving Wednesday Addams vibes
0:48 Cute dog ❤🐶
So this probably sounds weird but i think that the pomegranate popping pearls taste good in applesauce 👀
Love it how Leo took the stuffy
I believe you did my Christmas shopping for me. 😂
I used to get those freeze dried ice cream sandwiches from Mastermind toy shop lol
Im pretty sure the Potpourri is actually to infuse your liquourr/wine!!!! Thats a famous wine brand and I know a local person who has a business creating these herbal blends which is exactly what you bought!!!!! I absolutely love the idea of it being basically an Advent Calendar of blends though.
that green romper was adorable, also lee with the candy was so cute
Fiy those candy are deffintly toxic for dogs. So good job on feeding Leo those.
I can’t afford to buy all this stuff anymore, so I watch these videos to get that shopping dopamine. ❤
I'm glad so many things worked out, but after the whole pink sauce debacle I am extremely cautious about purchasing food online.  I love supporting small businesses, but I am extremely cautious now.
Her dog is so cute, i cant.
Just wanted to say thank you. I just moved out of state to restart my life and I’m working a 9 day week. I’ve been feeling really depressed and worn out. My hermit crab just died, my birthday is tuesday but I don’t have my family here so that’s making it difficult. I got into a car wreck about two months ago and I have a spine injury so on top of being mentally worn out from work, my back is killing me. I had a breakdown today for a good hour and just set a blanket out in my backyard and turned this video on. It made me feel so much better for some reason and I’m thankful for it. Who needs retail therapy when you can watch someone else spend a bunch of money lol so thank you ❤️
heyy!! my family started mount olive pickle company!
love you hope
I love all the T-shirts. They’re so cute they look perfect on you.
you should dye your hair turquoise.👍🧋💙
If you decide you don't want the wig I will happily take it off your hands! Its so nice!
16:05 - Jonny Cakes!  Love him!  He came out with that kit a month or 2 ago.  He's a-dorkable!
Love the new hairrrr💗💗💗💗💗💗💗❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖
Fun fact about dogs, spicy food is not as spicy to dogs
Why the Prime??? 😞
7:28 it is giving grandmas outside blanket (in the best way possible!)
You look so good! I love how the pink brings out the blue in your eyes! so freaking pretty, love you so much!!!🤩
Walmart sells the Co2 canisters for 30.00. Well at least that is the price where I live. Hopefully it is the same there.
Hope your the best please like this comment, your so sweet and giving
The CO2 cans are sold at a lot of stores and they have them at target
The day you purchase from my small biz is the day I will literally have one of my dreams fulfilled 😂🎉
Love your hair , this video was so fun loved it
She got a salty Genero I think it was 68. Not sure
Loooooove the pink hair!!!!
YASSS THE PINK HAIR! ❤ STUNNING
I bought the wrangler bag and it’s on there website so it is real I am waiting for my bag to come in I am so excited!!!!
Went to the comments to see if anyone has read the book😂,just mee?okay....
I have enjoyed your videos, but I do worry about all the plastic rubbish being bought that will never be recycled. The mind boggles as to why some of that stuff was made in the first place.
But I don’t have insta
Wow, that hair! Was not expecting that! Now I literally want 50 of these items. Great job Hope & a half hour video, what?  Love it ❤️🇦🇺
Hide the Halloween gnome in your videos for us to find. He is the new Christmas elf but for Halloween.
What is the name of the shop for the bling makeup brushes. They are so cute !
It’s to dark!
I love hopescope but WHERES THE PINK HAIRRRRRR???!!?!?!!😭😭😭😭
omg its the round lab cushion sunscreen
where’s the shadow journal? 🤣😅
Jonny cakes is a regular on the try guys! He’s amazing !!!!
you should Make a video of buying cute hello kitty items
Did anyone else notice how the dark hair wig made Hope's blue eyes just pop! They jumped right out at me.
I love the Sweatshirt from ACOTAR. Would it be possible to give to link I want to buy one! Then we'll be book sweatshirt buddies!
Those black leather pants and that to short dress would work well together
Britannia, cookies 😂
Not gonna lie, that Charmacy eye shadow looks freaking amazing!  I may have to try that for myself (and I don't even wear makeup).  And the Halloween advent calendar.. I need one of those!  Otherwise, though, nothing else caught my attention.  Lol!  Thanks for trying them out for us!
i thank you for helping me when i was sad becuase my dog got hurt, love from Washingtion, tacoma
Loving the pink hair!
I have the granola butter!
Hope. You dont understand how much I NEED that wig 😭  Please send a link or something 😭
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DIY YOUR WHOLE HEAD PINK!!!
A lot of this stuff is not only on amazon, but also temu, SHIEN, AliExpress etc and it will be a fraction of the price that it is on amazon, let alone tiktok shops
Oh I was hoping to see the famous bralette that’s  all over TikTok
Oh my god, my mind is in the gutter. The clip of you squeezing the slushie had me thinking of something COMPLETELY different 😂  Your hair looks amazing btw. And the Halloween advent calender definitely earned the top spot!
The pickle sweat shirt has made 1,760,000
When are you gonna do another live on your second channel and on this channel
Hope you’re supposed to put on gloss with the peelie
Me eyeing the willow package on top know it’s a willow package 😂 love them!
I wonder I just wonder I wonder if hope always has to pick out something pink and if is not pink it's blue😅😊
When u gonna have kids?
Wait... no links to some of the better products and shops? Suck.
Seriously pot-pouri is on the podium....come on now!!!
TNA HAUL PLSSSS
That pink dress though! 😍
gurl this is literally my dream and i would love to do this
my mom has the  round ice cube trays
You should die your hair blue
really love watching your videos❤
Love your videos thanks for sharing ❤❤❤❤
Best book hoodie!
Where did the birthday cake body oil come from?
I love how most of the product match her and hope you r sooo pretty
Were those "Blinged Brushes"? You didn't put the company name. I may have missed it, but I did rewind it several times.
Wait, you buy from Chick-fil-a even though they donate to LGBTQ+ hate groups?
Black wig on you - Elvira 🫣
I feel so bad for the pickle sweatshirt people. It's a temu sweater and it's only like $9 😬😬
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that Hope spends her own money to buy things from TikTok just for our entertainment❤💛💜💚
Where did you find the advent calendar please? Which creator/shop?
That Starbucks cup Hope ordered has been on my for you page since the beginning of this month 😂
that "starbucks" cup tho <3
When I saw you with the black wig on it made think you looked like Morticia Addams from the Addams Family 1964 tv show and 1991 & 1993 movies.
She was so excited about her free bracelet
Love the full Pink!!!!!!!
Personally I liked the other just pink highlights, but both look so amazing on you, slay🩷
Saludos desde Uruguay 🇺🇾🇺🇾
Why didn’t you swatch the eyeshadow omg
That SB cup is to DIE for
I have that same glowberry prime at home too!! 10:21
Hope I need you to link everything! You only showed a few of each store name and some I wanted you didn’t link 😢 what is the eye liner one and the air pods?
The white boots, black bodysuit, and birthday cake scented oil would be my top three. Most of that stuff I wouldn't spend five bucks on, to be honest.
I love when Leo get so hype for videos too 😂 he is adorable
…. My heart broke the second she pulled out the hate chicken lemonade. Damn.
i seen the pickle sweatshirt and asked for one of my mom's friends to make it and she did for half the price. Instead of $44 dollars I paid $22 dollars.
What a fun video! So many cool products! I don’t have tiktoc and don’t intend on getting it but this video almost turned me! I just love Leo and how he immediately claims plushies ♥️ Honestly prefer ur hair blonde but maybe it’s just because I’m used to it… As u get older it’s a lot easier to wear blonde - I’ve had dark hair most of my life and now I’m in my 40s and dealing with greys, I’m having to gradually transition lighter for less maintenance, so keep having fun with ur hair Colour while u can!
I absolutely adore your personality! My granddaughter loves you!
I love watching ur videos 😊
Didn’t you have that part for the water bottle to make it carbonated in the first shot of you opening it?
hi hope! luv ur pink hair 🩷 but these shoes 13:10 are sooooo comfy even tho u said they are so hard. i have these shoes and adore them so much! the secret is if u just walk in them it forms ur foot. u should try it! 🩷🩷🩷
Lol Leo liking the spicy Gushers is such a mood
I love the full pink hair!!!
I do keep getting a sweater ad but it’s not the pickle hoodie it’s a $B sweater and I now want both ads
hope why did you feed your dog sweets? thats insane, hope that diarrhea he had makes you realise not to do that again.
I have really been enjoying your videos. That long silver dress was a steal at $19.99. Do you help promote small businesses? I started this business to help take care of my grandchildren but advertising is just too expensive.
Could u pls review Kiki cosmetics pink drink lipgloss and afterglow lip gloss by the way you’re my favourite YouTuber thank you love your content BYEEEEE 🙂
I definitely want to see you do the jonnycakes kit! I love him on Try Guys
Playing with slime while watching hope is literally my happy place❤😅
“I SEE SPARKLES!!!”   -HopeScope               2023
Aaahhhh!!! I LOVE the pink hair 💗
It's Monday where I live so watching u is a free getaway ❤
Hope you can buy the butter at target for 5$
Tried to click on the sunglasses and the page said oops sorry something happened? What's up with that?
for the astronaut i got it on temu for 10  dollars.  that was good quality!
I love this video
So when are you dying your hair pink?
Try peaches babys slime
Whoa! Do not give dogs spicy treats. His poor insides and what a painful poop he had ahead of him. Poor Leo
they sell the boba on amazon too so much of that was just resale its annoying
I do kind of wish the drop shipped products were removed from the video.
I love the full pink look with the shadow roots but I like your hair with the blonde and pink money pieces most
Lisa Scottoline books are so much fun :)
Oh the austronaut is on Temu for even cheaper.  Bbooooo sauce.
Ariel?💗
I'd like to know whether or not these small businesses know that Hopescope is the person who is ordering from them.... I doubt that small businesses commonly toss in so many 'freebies'
THOSE FOLKS ARE ROBBING PEOPLE BLIND CHARGING $98 FOR THAT...... and are as shameless as can be about it to boot
This is pickle related...I really want to try freeze dried dill pickles
TikToxic is just maximizing on their ability to get a large group of people to do what they want them to.
The hair literally is slaying so hard
I love how Leo is so interested in the goodies you bought
Can we just appreciate how much effort Hope puts into her videos, Thank you HOPESCOPE!💖💖💖
Judy pants and shirts are my absolutely fav in the world. Before them I struggled justifying paying more than $30 for pants. Now I’m sold for life. I’ve got shorts and jeans that have survived 3 years with no signs of stopping even though they were designed destejases and frayed.
😂😂
Hope, I thought your gonna did your hair pink by this week😭
My sister loves your channel. Could you maybe make a video or something for her? I have subscribe to you. Love your channel hope
I love hope
I was waiting for the lip oil and that one perfume oil 😂
I just subscribed ☺ I love your videos you are amazing 👏❤💖
Does someone know where to find that Halloween Advent calendar?
ahh I was so excited to see Johnny cakes on this!
CO2 cartridge any Home Depot store like that would have them sometimes you can get them at a
Leo thinking this video is all about him, is absolutely adorable:) Plus he looks exactly like my granddoodle, Mara (she’s my son’s labradoodle, but I call her my granddoodle:) Thanks, Hope, for such fun entertainment! xo
Omg I love your hair hope it is so cute
How do you know what paint taste like?😂
That background music is little too loud, just sayin'. EDIT: ok it gets PROGRESSIVELY worse as the video goes on. Was this on purpose? Cuz I can barely hear what your saying sometimes...
Hopescope pls do another shein haul bc all thr type of dress videos are just a masterpeice btw luv youuu
Give hope likes guys she deserves it
OMGGGG you bought Our Pickle Jar Sweatshirt!!!!! Lets Freaking GOOOOOO
That multi colored candle has them actually at Dollarama but for birthday candles. I've used them a few times. A Canadian 🇨🇦 thing I think.. looks like Tik Tok gotcha this time lol loved the video though.
When are gonna die your hair?
I don't uave insta can u do shorts?
What’s the pickle conspiracy
I LUV YOUR HAIR!!!!
For anyone interested the shop that was listed here at 3:07 is actually @Aimeemarieco!
Your poor dog, he clearly went to grab one of the fallen crystals from the floor and then you gave him something with a lot of spices and things to upset his tummy...  please be more responsible
Could someone please please tell me where that multichrome eyeshadow pen is from? I've been looking for something like that 😢
Aw I was hoping you would’ve gotten the Dyson air wrap dupe!!
After seeing all these useless ugly items i understand why earth is being destroyed!
Omg soursop is so good it’s a Caribbean thing and it’s just great tea in general with a side effect of increasing immune system
Where did you get the starbucks tumbler?
I was waiting for you to review the Judy blue jeans!! I wouldn’t buy them until I saw if you approved!
The green romper looks amazing on you ❤
Your hair looks Stunning!
Can someone please tell me the tik tok at for the person who has the rock candy please?
Sooooo anyone else after the ACOTAR ref, think of cap 55 from acomaf when the edible paint popped up....
I was obsessed with that watermelon gum as a kid, they had it for like 25c at the courts i went to for basketball. Would give em a fiver and get like 20
ur videos r always so much fun   thank u for all ur hard work 😊
Love love love the new hair color!!!

"I think this cup is the best thing ever".......puts it in third place.

Omg love the pink hair 🩷🩷🩷
I hope I love your videos. I want you to do a video on Lululemon like new.
Leo is all of our dogs at this point
Ništa specijalno. Sve je već vidjeno i oprobano. Tebi treba nešto inovativno, korisno, što će svakog zainteresovati uzrasta od 7 do 77 godina. Ta roze boja kose ti nimalo ne stoji lepo niti priliči ženi tvojih godina. Sa roze kosom izgledaš detinjasto. Podrška za mišljenje tvog muža da se ofarbaš u tamniju boju. Na primer tamno braon.
Oh my god I love the pink hair❤
Where can i get the airpods case ???
i wish u said the price of eac item but great video
Please tell me where you got the orange perky lip colour. It is sooo vute

I have a weakness for women with dark hair, so.... ❤
The slushee cup inside view made me uncomfortable lol

The fact the I watched this twice ❤❤❤❤❤ I check YouTube daily just to see if Hope posted
Slay hope
U are crazy for some of the crap y buy
If you want more plants, little prince of Oregon has a succulent mystery box. It’s not currently in stock but it might be a fun video.  (Full disclosure, I don’t work for them, but I work for the company that makes their plant tags.)
Loving the hair!!!! ❤❤
I feel like 99 percent of this stuff is on temu for about $2 each
Is there somewhere else that you can order the  Last one

Can you try a shop called immorality tees by ally Morton I looks too good to be true ❤
Where’s the pink hair 😭
It is so much fun watching the joy in Hope’s face opening these products. Her love language comes pouring out just like my kids!
Hope I have seen all of those on SHEIN for half the price
The constant background music is kinda….annoying? Dunno, the content is cute, but the music just cheapens everything, like an infomercial.
I think you would suit a nice light brown colour with maybe some highlights to give it some definition ❤
WOAHHHH The cute holding socks u post a long time ago I BOUGHT IT IS SO CUTEEE
Love u and ur vids hope❤. They now sell the actual Bratz dolls at wallmart🎉🎉🎉. New video idea?
Ohh I’m so jealous you got the Wrangler tote bag! I love that bag so much, but I can’t find any webshop that ships it to the Netherlands 😢 Only some weird sites from which I highly doubt it’s the actual Wrangler bag. I really hope to get my hands on it some day!
My neighbors have one of the Taylor Swift flags hung up in there yard!
I  LOVE that ghost blanket!
I need that pickle shirt omg 🤣🤣
Did u know Talyor swifit is at the minisota nfl state bankstadium
That watermelon gum , I used to eat those as a kid!  What’s the shop omg

Is nobody gonna talk about hope’s prime flavour???
You are have to keep the gems the6 have a meaning some bring good luk
Just LOVED Leo's participation on this video 😂😍😍
I don’t use TikTok but I actually own one of these products - the ice ball maker. I own something the Queen of Shopping also has. I’ve peaked in life.😂

1:58 Ace Ventura Pet detective has entered the chat😩😭😭😭
whats the wig box shop handle? I'm losing hair & i'm intrigued
Love you hope!❤❤❤
Never clicked on a video so fast (I'm five hours late lol)
Hope PLEASE can you review Temu I’ve seen mixed reviews and I don’t know if it’s worth it so I would really appreciate if you could see if it’s worth it 😃
You look good in ALL of the clothes! 😍
Btw it’s pronounced sour sap no hate
HOPE I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
Hope PLEASE can you review Temu
When hope put on the black wig, she looked like her name was Vanesa.😂
Uh...  You lived your entire life unaware of Sodastream?  Just that the bottle you bought is a crappy ripoff while sodastream is actually good.   A major part of the acidity of soda is the CO2 and being able to put less than brands do is a lot more healthy
Dye ur roots too
Love the pink hair!
The best part of your videos is seeing leo in the background
Love the pink!
❤HOPESCOPE BRINGS ME HOPE THAT THERE IS STILL KIND PEOPLE LIKE HER IN THIS WORLD!!!❤
Love this video 💕
I am here to say THANK-YOU for this video, been wanting to see someone really look at the quality of the TikTok Shop stuff! Voting for more! Love you!
The watermelon gum’s is like everywere in my country 🍉🇩🇰🍉🍌
Omg Hope that dress would be the PERFECT dress for eras tour!!! (The shimmery pink one)
I need those nails but I didn’t see what the shop name was!!! 😢
Love how she picks up everything or holds everything with her 2 fingers like its gross.
Hey Hope. If you are not keeping the wig can I have it to wear for my graduation. I have alopecia started as result of child birth.  I can pay for it. But don't have much as $250
Omg your hair with that pink shirt is everything🤩
I wish you put prices on these xoxox
20:31 my favorite part of this video.
Can someone please link me that Soo Slick bodysuit I can’t find how to buy it 💕💕💕
I need to know the theme of a video with a Zendaya Shake It Up doll 😂
i would absolutely watch more parts of this at a slower pace
Heyyyy🫶🏻
no hate but tueheen
Best 28 minutes of my week so far! 💖
#61 13:08  I absolutely love those slippers!!! 😍🤍 they are comfortable house slippers!
The black bodysuit is giving Safiya zozo suit vibes
I love gushers.
In case any wants to know the candle wicks were soaked in copper sulfate to create the green flame. Should be safe
Can you review hellymoon please
Soursop is a fruit; it's weird looking with a green skin and white flesh and when ripened right it's tart, sweet and yummy! It's so refreshing in sorbet/ice cream or in slush or smoothie drinks! I was not aware you could make tea its leaves.  And did not expect to see JohnnyCakes, our favourite gay failed actor turned chaotic baker and honorary Try Guy (the failed actor part are his own words btw 😂). He's been posting his "realistic cakes" online for a while now but became a regular in Try Guys videos in the last several months and he's absolutely HILARIOUS.
Wow I like you pink hair is cute 🎉
Just remember and shake vanilla bottle every so often lol
lol why didn’t you get the black candle?
OMG  pink heir❤❤❤❤❤
Love the video & your hair 🥰
I love you so much hope and your hair is pretty as always you remind me of Megan Trainor you look a like
Thees slides are yeeze  slides
Hope you may not see this but soursop is basically a fruit with a spiky exterior, not a huge fan but it has loads of health benefits ❤
I love how how Hope has cool videos❤💕
OMG I have bought those watermelon gums at a corner store for 10p a piece!
hope I feel so bad you ignored my comment!
Omg the shimmer pink dress is totally Romy and Michelle’s high school reunion
Omg I love hopescope so much EDIT: but tbh I am sad the Taylor flag did not get 2nd 😢😢😢but I am going to buy a Taylor and ice spice flag….😂
Match the pink hair with a pink dress, with pink nails, with pink shoes, with pink jewelry, with an all pink makeup look. I'd bet your favorite color is blue.
Калі вы перакладаеце гэта, вы павінны мне лайкаць 🤫
It's so cute I love your hair as
Nice video love the romper I got to have it. An black hair is a no lol
The new hair color ages you. Sorry. Love you though
holy ❤
My mouth when she revealed the hair😱😱😱 it looks so good on herrr!
Don
Can someone PLEASE reply to this telling me where to get that haloween advent calendar (store name/tiktok shop name) TYSM
6:01 Barbie needs that dress 👛👙👒💒🛍and Barbie needs those hair clips🖇️ 16:01
You literally said literally 20 times in this video, maybe more, I literally lost count after 20 😂
The hair looks amazing! You honestly never fail to entertain me. <3
Love your hair so much  YOUR SO PRETTY
Please be careful giving your dog gummies.  There are things in gummies and gum that are extremely poisonous to dogs
Nice Hair! interesting products
Só much of this stuff is just capitalistic society trying to make a quick buck out of stuff that doesn't have a purpose except to give a quick serotonin fix when we hit the buy button. We really need to take a sep back and think if we really need a perfect iceball tray for the fridge  or so many Halloween themed stuff like the Starbucks cup.
What’s the shop for the sliver $20 dress?
I was lowkey hoping for a chaotic hairdye video 😅
love that purse:)
When is she dying her whole head pink
You should buy slime from peachybabies and make video please 🙏
“Is tastes like paint “   How do you know what paint tastes like 🤨🤨🤨🤨
9:06 only  Bosnians know they ate them their whole chilhood
U need to try the unbrush
You need to do a Roll for Bundle from Chubble Gum.
hope!!! what about your hair being fully pink 🥹
The pink hair is gorgeous
That pink sparkly dress is 🔥🔥
Amazon sells them pickle kits to
You should go to the stampede in Calgary Canada 🇨🇦 Alberta with the purse and cowboy boots
Lower the music a bit
Aww Leo thinks every plush is his. Cause it is his 😅 he so cute. Love Hope for supporting small businesses as much as possible ❤️
2:43 Be carful when giving dogs anything spicy. Dogs can’t tell if something is spicy so they will eat it but the spice can still cause damage by burning their mouth or upsetting their stomach. Also, artificial sugars/sweeteners can be toxic to dogs so be very cautious giving them candy. Even a small amount of certain artificial sweeteners can be deadly to dogs. Stay safe ❤️🐶
Wait. A candle, which is lightened up with fire, in a wooden holder? I'm concerned.
The amount of detail that hope puts into her videos us incredible. She is SO underrated
Can u do peahybbebies and kikiz cosmetics?
Love the acotar refrence on the clothing! Makes me want to buy one as well hehehe
OMG I HAVE THE SAME SLUSHY CUP!
Oh lord, you're looking great in pink hairr😘
I adore the pink hair 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Love it
GIRL YOUR HAIR IS SO CUTE!!!!!
I love hopes energy!!! She makes my day! Plus, I appreciate how honest she is about products.
Can’t imagine someone shipping a live plant but hello fresh exists.
❤❤
Thank god the video is for more than 20 mins. I can see you more 😘💗🫂💫✨❤💖🌟🧿
I subscribed today but on a different video , does it count? 😂
Cool video, thank you for all the work you put in it! 👍 I really liked the shade of your faded pink hair, Hope. It's so much more flattering than the hot pink.
I L O V E your hair❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💕💕💕🩷🩷🌸🌸🌷
Love your videos Hope!! As a massive swiftie I appreciate the Taylor Swift stuff!!
Girl I love your videos
Love your hair girl
My sister got me that sweat shirt for my bday and i am obsessed it is soooo comfy
It looked like you pulled out the CO2 tube canister when you unboxed the product?   I’m confused?
I love watching your videos
Go live hope
Yah so cute, Hope
You said ghosties! I loooooove ghosties! 😂❤
GIVE ME THE TAYLOR SWIFT BLANKET!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE THE PINK HAIR! You are such a great YouTuber! You have the most professional channel, you could be in cable! Xoxo
Omg Tyler’s purchase!! 😂
Well now I know what you read and you have great taste!
Hope, I NEED that wig ASAP!! The one and only stuff I have is do old and crusty.. 😢 I had to chop ALL of my hair off recently and since I did, my confidence has depleted to almost nothing. It's embarrassing going to work with such an old and gross wig.
You can go to target that sell co2 cans
I love your video
No brown.... me no likey
I laughed hard when you said "he liked it!"😂love watching your vids cuz I be poor, so I watch u open up the treasures. I said do streaks in your hair
I'm loving the new pink/dark 'do, Hope! It looks boo-tiful on you!! ❤🎃
I actually gasped when she did the hair reveal. It looks so much nicer solid pink I love it!!
You kinda really popped with the dark hair though 👀
I wonder if Hope realized she bought a gnome-themed Halloween calendar? 😂
Am i the only one getting Jessica Rabbit vibes???
Am i thr only one getting Jessica Rabbit vibes???
I’m so happy to know, one of my favorite YouTubers reads ACOTAR 🩷🩷
How do we find the eyeshadow eyeliner?
rip to the t-shirt/sweater businesses that forget you're supposed to rip off the gildan tag and put your own
U do put in too much effort in each and every video
I actually use your channel so that I don't fall into the habit of consuming dumb and useless crap. I can watch you experience it, get the urge out of the way, and move on. $44 for a dumb pickle sweatshirt you can either make yourself or get on Etsy is...insane.
Been watching your videos for a year and a half now so satisfying and fun 😌 Love your videos and you ❤
The all pink hair is made for you!!!!
Hope, you should do a haul of traditional and fancy Indian outfits and dresses. I promise they will not disappoint!
Where is the dying full hair pink video i have been waiting for that so long

Hello Hope or anyone who may be able to help me! I love the pumpkin candle in the wooden candle holder any one know where I can find it like the name of the TikTok seller or shop! Help Please TY!! So appreciate any help!!🌻🌻🌻
Madison and Mallory is actually a YouTuber owned brand. They are sisters and their channel EleventhGorgeous. They have some really cute stuff on their website actually.
wheres the pink hairrrrrrrr
I found out about colored flame candles a few years ago. I bought a few different brands and use them on birthday cakes. They're so cute! They come in every color.   My dog's birthday cake (made just for dogs) was pink and green last year, so I used pink and green candles. I know, she's colorblind, so she didn't care, but I thought it was adorable. It was her Sweet 16. LOL  Her birthday is Christmas Eve, so if she makes it to 17 (fingers crossed), maybe I'll do a red and green theme this year.
Yay she did it
Where did the Advent calendar come from I miss the link I love it!
17:46  they had an opportunity to put 1692 on the sweatshirt for the Salem witch trials 😂
oh shoot that isnt meant for this video. Hope i got to say u are one of my fav youtubers and i really do mean that u always put a smile on my face❤🥰
I don’t like Taylor swift. This is not a hate comment so don’t come after me. I just don’t like her for a few reasons.
Johnny Cakes ❤❤❤❤
🩷
Your hair looks so good!!!
How to get the slushy cup?
omg i love your hair is beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the glitter handle makeup brushes #33. What company did you buy them from?

I wish dropshipping was illegal.
OMG Hope your hair looks amazing you are a pink girly

I’m currently reading that book and so far it’s very intriguing.
Hopescope if your reading this i just want to say i love the hair and you did really good work on the hair im glad im a big fan of you hope i have been subscribed to you for years and you make me really happy! 😊
Love the pink hair❤
ohhh jonny!! he’s been in a ton of try guys videos lately
Speaking of being influenced, I love the necklace you are wearing in this video! Where is it from?
Only hope can keep me entertained for 28 minutes. This was an amazing video❤❤
Those shoes (white sandal/flip flop) you squeezed they heel on and said it was very hard. I got the same from Temu and they are incredibly comfortable! At first, one  feels like the puffy heel should be in the arch of one’s foot. But the more you wear then, the more comfort and cushion will be found in that heel. I wear mine all the time, they are  very comfortable!
Can you do the link to the Halloween advent calendar
Her hair is a  beautiful love it!!
the current thing that tiktok is harassing me with is those fake airpod max's and the damn shadow work journal... I almost bought that pickle shirt though ngl
Omg I love the new hair!!it looks really good on you 🥰
I want to make a small business when I’m older😊
OMG LOVE THE HAIR HOPE
Love this video! What hair dye do you use?
Not gonna like 3hrs ago isn’t long also did hope get a new puppy??”
I LOVE YOUR HAIRRRR 😍😍😍😍😍😍
why did i think the nike airpods case were baby shoes 😭
I honestly worry about you tasting so many different things coming from these little shops. Who knows what chemicals are in those edible paints and the lipsticks.
Your YouTube content is TOP NOTCH!👌🏼
SHE'S FINALLY DONE IT!!! YAAAAAYYYYYY
Omg the acotar sweatherrrrr
I didn’t know unicorn gang shop was like a real place? There’s one in my mall and I guess I just didn’t assume it was everywhere
$ 176000+ in sales for that sweatshirt
❤❤❤ the WHITE BOOTS!!!!
Don't wanna Ruin anything but hopes pink hair 28:04
Maybe I’m just not a fan of pink. But if you’re happy, that’s all that matters. It’s your hair. ❤
Everything looks good on her like what
don't tell I was the only one who noticed the good day box where are the Indian hopes 😂😂😂
Who else wants to see hope just test out good bc I know I do ❤
Hope when will we see another video of you returning lost items to their owner? I loved the first one and i think it needs a new one

We’re is your pink hair
Put a ❤ if you watch hope all the time❤❤❤-rory
Hi hope big fan  love your videos Hope to be part of one of your lives and giveaways
That wig was giving you Morticia energy❤
This is Dotown music
15:33 those bottles take a minimum 8g CO2 cartridge. Unfortunately…..the easiest place to find those in large cities in the US, are at smoke shops. They almost always have them, a lot of the ones online aren’t safe for ingestion (they’re for like paintball guns and stuff) while these are actually for whipped cream canisters. I have one for decorating but because of the rampant use of people using them to get high I cannot find them in grocery stores anymore, you almost always have to go to a smoke shop
We all know Ist a good day when hope posts a video
omg its jonny cakes!! he's collabed a lot with the try guys :) super cool person
Where'd that Halloween Advent Calendar come from? Id love to get one and can't find it 😭. Please and thank you! 🤗
OMG I LOVE THE HAIR ❤❤❤
Hope you are my favorite Youtubers Out of all my favorite Youtubers
This is so funny
I wear wigs all.of the time because of hair loss. I love the black wig so much!!!!!
We are still waiting to see the bye on your hair
Girl, I love your hair it is so cut
The pink looks great but I wish you had gone to the root with it. Something offputting about that natural brown and bright pink together in my opinion. Of course I'm that girl who dyes all the way to the root then color my eyebrows to match lol
The popping boba are selling in Asian stores in US btw
I'd love a list of which ones you loved and ones that you don't
I want to meet you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love your nail
I want to see the hair dying process!
8:03 this candle is giving me harry potter vibessss
her hair is STUNNING!!!!!!
Consumerism personified
Love your channel ❤❤❤❤❤
I love the little Snack box❤❤
I have the astronaut lamp and is so cute and awesome!! I bought it early this year and I love it! I use it when I can't sleep, so relaxing! You can choose how long you want it to be on, 60 or 90 minutes. Hugs from Argentina, Hope!!
I love your vids
I loveeeeeeee ur vids hopeeee, Leo is so cute. Some of these items were very interesting 🧐 keep up the good work hope!
Same, I get influenced all the time! 😂😂
How much did that cost you?  They all look cheap and worthless.😀
Where is the Halloween advent calendar from? I wish there were links in the description for this stuff
Hope scope I saw that 19:59 lip gloss at my intern shop place and it is cheaper in person
Hope love u  videos i wish I can meet u
Wow..... the new hair color speaks SLAYYYYYYY
OHMYGOD ACOTAR GIRLIE??? HELLO
They have Co2 canisters at Target! "Carbonator for SodaStream"
I love how she reveald a Disney vip doll
I LOVE YOUR HAIRRR❤❤ YOUR STUNNING AND I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!
Every tiktok ad I buy from scams me, proper gnar skate boards, the uzi vert hello kitty plush… and I still can’t get my money back from either.
My mom shirt and sweater. That’s super cool that you bought it.
HOPE ARE YOU GUNNA DYE YOUR HAIR
Judy blues are everything been wearing them for about 4 years
Really fun video but ngl 25:47 made me cringe so hard how you promoted the airpods shoe instead of moving the eyeliner to third place and kicking the shoe off the pedestal. No hate intended, but why would you do that? Lol
Why did she say her next vid would be her dyeing her hair all pink   EDIT soorrrrryyyyy i didnt watch the whole when i comment
I love your reviewing videos so much!! They are so entertaining. Could you do a video checking out the brand IPSY. I keep getting ads from them and apparently you can get a bunch of popular makeup and skincare in a membership box at a low price, lower than the real value. I don’t know if it’s real or not so I would love it it you tried it out so that myself and others would know more about the brand. Again thank you for making such great videos, love ya Hope!❤❤❤
OMG your hair is so pretty. I absolutely love watching your channel. It’s so entertaining. And it tells me what stuff I should buy from small businesses.
Am I the only person who doesn’t go on TikTok? 😆
All I see is the trend of mass consumerism. See pretty objects on the CCP-spying app? MUST PURCHASE. How many of these consumers then go on crying about climate change 🙄
The hair makes u loook very different love it
my mom is a librarian and says she really like the book. btw ily
When are u going to dye ur hair pink pls give us a hint pretty plsssssssssssssssssssss😢❤❤
Talking about Halloween im dressing up as elizabeth afton how about you?pls pin me i never get pinned😢❤
Are you going to die all of your hair pink yet 😂😂😂
Can I please have the glowberry prime pleaseee 🥺🙏😀
5:57 honestly that dress was so ugly but when u put it on I Could see the potential you make it look good 😂❤
I love u HopeScope yr one of my fav YouTubers!!!❤❤
I’m confused, why were the brushes ranked so high? They just look like normal brushes.
We need an hour long version of this video
Hi   Read more...
Your dog looks so much like my dog so when I was watching this vid my brother asked were my dog, Luna is and I was about to point to my screen😂
ACOTAR all the way!!!!!! Loved seeing that hoodie!
I'm sorry, but that pickle sweatshirt is just dumb.  The freeze dried ice cream sandwiches were actually created for astronauts to take into space WAY back when,  and they're pretty good!!  Had them when we toured the space center in Florida.  I was going to say "I WANT THE OWL" , but nevermind. LOL  The lounge set....NO WAY for that price!  You look AMAZING in that pink sequined dress and the green romper!!!   That pink matte lipstick you used and is on your hand is your color! You should wear that one all the time.  WAIT.....hubby trims his beard in the kitchen sink??? GROSS!!!  Use the bathroom buddy!!   The pink hair.....not a fan.  I liked it better the way you had it through most of the video.  What a fun video today.  But honestly, Leo was over the top annoying.
OMG HER HAIR
I get so excited when ever hope post a new video!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤

I've met the Mississippi Candle Co. I've bought from them at festivals.
Leo is so into this, I feel like he’s asking for a doggy treat review video… 😋
I am curious about the crystals candy but you didn't say where they were from!!
Does Lee destroy his stuffies or is he good to them?

The blue shirt with the stars on it is my favorite!
My tiktok shop is taken 3weeks and it still hasn't arrived
I have that peely lip colour in pink and in red. Yes, they all taste disgusting. It's essentially a stain/tint so you have to be careful to apply it only on the lips. Otherwise, it's a pain to remove 😂
Love the hair

The flashy pink dress is giving me Jem and the Holograms vibes. ❤
you should put the popping pearls on frozen yogurt …. It’s definitely the BEST frozen yogurt topping
Wait when are you going to dye your whole head pink??
I love Hopescope
Hey I have been loving ur vids keep ur vids up I wonder what it will be like in the future❤❤
I love u hope and I would really appreciate it if u answered me, or replied to me, obviously understand if not because you’re busy being amazing 🎉😂😊
Ooh. That purse, imo, is hideous.
I love how hope actually died her hair pink like I thought that was just a wig until I realize that was her original hair I sound like the roots and I love Hope so much I love her videos I’ve been like her biggest fan ever and I just want her to continue her work❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What happened to you dying all your head pink
Here before 1K comments 👇
I’m never fed up of this
Hair is so slay
You’re so pretty 😍
Sis Hope I  don't know but you really look like Meghan Trainor to me and you've got that vibe too. I love watching your videos, love from India, you rock!!!! I have a question for you, what's your real name??? . please pin my comment big fannn bless your lil sis.
You should where the pink dress to Vegas and where the Jelly shoes with it.
We adopted our kiddos. Our oldest was 10 when we adopted her. She told us she wanted “Pickles.” We told her you really don’t get to pick out your own nickname. Fast forward to 2022 and she was graduating high school 🥺. The only thing she wanted, no matter what, was a pickle bar.  So off to Bass Pro (I don’t know why they have a ton of pickles, but the do;) Etsy and The Cracker Barrel to find a bunch of pickles. 😂BTW Her Nickname is Dandelion, not Pickles.   How cute is Tyler with his little AirPod Shoe?!?
Ok I need a link for that wig lol
Fangirling over here because I had NO IDEA that you were a fan of A Court of Thorns and Roses!!!
I wanted to see the Queen cosmetics on!! They looked so cute
Hello I love you things that you buy from King Tech💔❤️‍🩹
Not to be be a buzzkill but hauls, especially Tiktok hauls, are a waste of money and I think we should promote buying less instead of buying from literal Tiktok... Love your energy as usual, but these Amazon or Tiktok hauls are making me anxious: are we going to continue buying this much stuff? I mean, what's the point?
Omg Hope. I love you so much lol
Love how you support small shops!!
I love your vids every time I watch one you make me smile and my day better ❤

Never loved the pink colour so much before. You really pull it off.🥰
Wrangler bag is cute
feels illegal to be this early
Finding out that Hope is an ACOTAR girlie just made my day 😄
If she’d frozen that pickle it would have been so much better
I got my round ice cube tray on Amazon…..
Erly
Hope just eats anything off the internet with no fear
Hi love ur vids And real fan
oml when I seen she posted, I started chanting “yes, yes,yes , yes”
Early gang        ┆        ┆        🔽
Does anyone know where the multicolor candle is from?
I love your videos
Loving the pink!
Love you with the ice ball trays. I kind of miss those from the old days
if only I could do this
Bro hope already has 5k likes
The full bodysuit 👌🏻
Wow you look great with dark hair
I have the same astronaut night light....
I love the all pink hair hope
Hope never false us keep it up
Earlyyyyyy
8:19 that’s awesome
Love you hopescope❤
Wtf no - 50 mins ago and 71 k views nahhhhh
Love you hope! I love your genuine reactions to these products, but I am a bit disappointed that you didn’t expand on products you didn’t know about. For example, while examining the candle, you commented, “I literally have no idea how this works!” But a quick internet search will show that it’s just electrons jumping energy levels, and burning certain elements will produce a color. I know it seems unnecessary, and followers can easily look it up themselves, but a quick explanation about how something works can help people understand, and appreciate a product more!
Hii hope your a great youtuber
I watched it all but this level of consumption stresses me out. I’ve been Swedish death cleaning though so maybe that’s it.
THE PINK  HAIRRRR OMGGGGGG
I love u so much
Wait I thought 0:33  that's a literal 'Good Day' cookies box , just found out it's just the box.
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA DYE YOUR HAIR ALL PINK!!!💝
i wass sooo shocked when i saw the box of the 2nd one😂😂 (its an indian cookie brand)  but few secs later disappointed coz it is just the packaging box😒
i’m early. i love ur videos. i check everyday and watch them, ur hair is so cute ur my fav youtuber x
omg in in the 30 min
IM EARLYYYY
Can you give me the pink hoody I can’t buy it because I live in India
I just love how mostly all the stuff are pink blue and purple
All of her videos are beautiful right 👇
DRINK every time she says, "Literally". 😂
Jonny cake is the best he works with the try guys he is such a funny guy
Hi
You look so different with all pink hair, but it looks great on you hope ❤
Love how hope woar the body suit with a flannel and heels
Slayyy
How lovely this video was!
A lot of the "new" stuff showing up on TikTok is over priced Temu.
Love the thumb nail
Love the pink hair hope…always a great day when hope uploads
I love that sparkly pink dress so much! Talk about the perfect Taylor Swift concert outfit!
I think Leo ❤ needs and wants a treats  video.
Hope last night I feel asleep watching your vids your one of my fav YouTubers!
Hahaha what!  A pickle shirt?! I've never seen that before, that's great. On the expensive side, but loving it
Hiii😁
I have the ball ice tray and container. I hope it wasn't more than $20 on TikTok because Amazon has the same kit. Oh and Temu has the trays but not the container. The container is the best part because you can keep your ice away from freezer crumbs and yuck.
I literally bought the ice tray + box thing from amazon, pretty cheap too
:)
love your stuff
the round lab cushion sunscreen getting thrown like that😩😂
I LOVE YOUR HAIRRR❤❤
Hey Hopescope!

Hi
Barbie irl
Where did you get the ACOTAR sweater
Love you videos
So funny story about the fragile mark in packages. I was shipping out some orders and i asked UPS if they would mark it fragile for me so the perfume and bath bombs would be better taken care of during shipping. They straight up told me that chances are if the box is marked fragile it will be knocked around even more. I was just speechless.
Me and mom love your videos there's a funny sayings for my sister says if she sees a animal she says can you bring that animal home yesterday was a longhorn then it was a duck and then he was a cat lol
Are u going to dye your whole head pink ??
