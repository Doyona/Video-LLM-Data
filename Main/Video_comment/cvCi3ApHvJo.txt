This was basically new zealand vs the north
I love these games they need to make it a yearly thing and a 3 game series
This ranks as one of my favorite games of all time, they definitely should do this again.
Why did beauden barret play for north and jordie play for south when they are both from new plymouth north island
What it looks like if The All Blacks played The All Blacks.
Both were evenly matched but the South's winning card could have been having Whitelock as cappie.
Both teams played fantastic rugby. This game needs to be played every year.
So much potential. All of it frittered away in 3 years.
im from south
I watched the full match and I must say watch the WHOLE thing - it plays so intensely with such a next level  skill set your jaws will be hanging and your eyes will be buldging in absolute awe.  This truncated version does not do the full match justice. Love from Canada.  You Kiwis made my day.  FULL ON.
Geez, talk about a lively crowd 😂
Good night sweet
Love the quick handling in that 2nd North try.
They should make this like how we have state of origin in aus it would be good
North team can literally be the All Blacks but still lost
What a match 😊
this is better than super rugby final
Lessgoo mighty south
TEAMS
IS  HARD TO PICK A SIDE, IS THE ALL BLACKS AT ONCE, I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE TEAM
I AM MEXICAN BUT  I LOVE NEW  ZEALAND   RUGBY, I LOVE  IT EVEN MORE THAN FUTBOL
This is like that spider man meme when he's pointing at himself or when Captain America had to fight himself in endgame... the topest tier friendly I've seen
Why McKenzie is not playing for allblack in tri nation?
This was better than any test match this year.
Match of the year.  Its beens years since I've enjoyed watching such a close Union game
As a non-rugby fan and non-New Zealander, I have to ask: do both teams do the haka before the game?
This is great how both teams are incredible All Blacks starting lineups.
This has to be on of the best games for a long time
Best game of 2020
The fake crowd actually works. I had to read comments to remember its fake. Were the players hearing it too, maybe that's what made this better than green v gold.
HAHAHAHA WHO ELSE FELL FOR THE FAKE CROWDS CHEERING.....I KNOW I DID
How is barret from the north and his brother from south??
When there is nomore competition. NZ plays itself😂😂😂😂 Making a group chat by yourself bcz u have a great humor.
just love watching NZ rugby from a 🇿🇦 Fan 👌🏼
Only my backyard New Zealand rugby fans/players will get haha,  Last try wins !!!!
The placing of the ball from Ioane is exactly why the ABs drew with the Wallabies. No fancy stuff is needed sometimes hey.
Go South Island
Best game of the year so far💪
Super Rugby, for real. Thanks for the highlights.
Make this a 3 game series best out of 3 this has the potential to be as big as state of origin
Show the whole fcukn game bro gummon oi FFS
Full match should be posted here
clark should of been there at the last tire
For the players its not about, nth or sth, but showing the selectors I'm worthy of wearing that all black jersey. And if it means, I have to beat the $hite out of brothers so be it...
Bro v bros
Unbelievable game- what an ending
dumb question, i know, but was there any haka? im from argentina and we didnt get to watch the match other than highlights on youtube
This is a knockoff version of state of origin
The north will rise again
In a match like this the highlights needs a highlights
Great play from the South forwards
Cough cough
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner
Anyone else form New Zealand? 🇳🇿
Mmmmm..... looks like your South plays a lot like the Springboks.... ; p -- but yo, that last catch oh my soul.
The most exciting rugby match you can draw up is All Blacks v. All Blacks - shock
Boyo, that was such a good match.
After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell.  How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever.   Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven?   Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven.   Salvation Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). He also said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven.  Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  Deserving hell for sins Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Repent So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.  No other way  If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked "Jesus Christ." There is no other entrance.  By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you. No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe  All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.
Evenly matched teams. It was pretty much a matter of who got the last possession.    Wednesday —September 9, 2020.
wonderful Josh - awesome try Will.....
What a fantastic product. Love watching my NZ rugby from the USA.
Just imagine the stadium being jammed packed and the South Island fans going crazy when Will Jordan steals it at the end
Damn one of the best games of rugby I’ve ever seen
Great game,  i thought sevu reece had a quiet game.  Some goid big loose fowards on display. Thanks
Wow, what a finish.
Si il y a des français qui regarde ce commentaire ça fait plaisir de voir de si bon arbitres, pas comme certains en top 14 qui demande a chaque action la vidéo pour prendre une décision la réalité elle est la, superbe match ça fait plaisir de voir un si beau rugby
Will Jordan All Black
Should do a North vs South best out of 3..
fake crowd noise fake heros they dont care about your lockdown dont support the sport anymore
i just love marshalls commentating can you believe it
I’m an Aussie,  but that was some of the best rugby I’ve seen in some time. Well done boys - beautiful plays. It’s the only game with over 7mins of highlights cause there were so many! What a game of tug-o-war! Beauty!
nice game
Jordan Barret from Taranaki? Why is he playing for South?
How do they difference north vs south ?
Love how loud the crowd is when the stands are empty XD
Great game, look forward to a repeat with a full stadium.
I just have to enjoy this all talented teams they are all spectacular ....didn't matter win or lose
This kid Will Jordan🔥🔥
both teams would slay everyone else at international level. it hurts :/
I hear a crowd but when you look at the stands there’s no one haha
The black jerseys are still having nightmares about the white jerseys. Lol
What an amazing game!!
Where's the crowd?
Great game - loved the delay on the pre recorded crowd cheer...  always slightly behind the action.
Why the fake crowd noise...? Its not even in sync!
Jordon awesome never seen him! Replace Reece and bridge lol i thought they had a quiet trial and WC
крутой матч)))
What a complete banger of a game
As a Wallaby fan I'd like to say 'Gulp'!
Who’s doing the crowd effects... 👌 lol
Finally some rugby worth watching. They need a state of origin like 3 match series.
What an amazing showcase of Rugby.
The North remembers
So basically this is AllBlacks vs AllBlacks. The fake crowd is hilarious . Great game though.
some match, great high quality competition
What an amazing match!  They played their hearts out for sure. Next time can we pls make it a series. 🙏
What an amazing fucking game 😨 i want this competition every year !!!
So enjoyable, NZ rugby in awesome shape, big shame the world is in lockdown right now
Superb game of Rugby.. well done both NZ sides.  Watching in France!
This is why we love rugby
Top notch Rugga on display. wow.
they not letting up even against the other all blacks/its like having 2 mike tysons damn
https://youtu.be/dMPyeZTcLBY
3 Match Series🙏
Barrett’s dirty shoulder charge on Ioane
Kiwi rugby is the best rugby
Everyone had the North tacking this, even the All Blacks social media pages favoured the North. They forgot Brad Mooar had three SR trophies!!
Now I hope they make this an annual event and not a one off thing ever since the sport went professional we haven't had a north vs south match since the early 90's
This match is a good example why your forwards need to dominate, the north has the backs but the south killed them with the dominating forwards and winning ultimatly
Honestly this is not a full highlights video. It’s just the tries, the game had so many ‘high’ light runs/hits/offloads. I mean you missed the very first 40 metre highlight run by Caleb Clarke!
Man I hope this Competition stays. Bring Nzers back to loving rugby... Sick of seeing NZers acting like they're from Australia with their Aussie accents during Origin when some of them has never been to Australia..
2 best teams in the world
Great rugby. Annoyingly stupid fake crowd effects.What's next? Fake crowd cardboard cutouts? https://youtu.be/sha4H-8oA7g
Is it island of origin or is it north island teams vs south island teams? Thanks
👍👍👍👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😲
They should do this every year
Absolute Magic!
I’ll see you guys in a decade for the next match
So basicaly any of those teams could sin the RWC 🤯
I guess Reiko's second try wasn't worth the highlights reel. Busting through two tacklers mustn't be worthy these days lol.
where can i watch the full match ?
all those empty seats and fake crowd noises - lol
Why aren't there fans in the stands? I thought NZ had the pandemic under control?  Coming from America with love 🙏 🇺🇸
https://youtu.be/mFMPVAFaglw
can't tell if lockdown haircuts or just new zealand! very exciting game, a barbarian feeling too it
New Zealand could field 2 teams in the top 5 of the world 😢
the trophy is called.. “Maui’s Tomato”
The sound of crowds cheering but all the seats are empty...
Why is there no full match replays?
Can we just have 2 all blacks teams? One team to play the championship, and the other can go northern hemisphere tour....
Great game, one disallowed try and one try that should have not been allowed, but evened out in the end.  The scary part is both these teams would give any other side a run for their money.
Wait why are beauden and Jordie on different sides aren't they both from the same island?
Grrrrr!!!!
To the person who is reading this : You are amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a wonderful day
I think we're set for half backs for a while now. Quality props, centres and wings coming out of our ears. Besides being south biased the raw talent from the youth across the country is super refreshing to see. Typical never day die kiwi finish.
⬅️        You know what to do ⬇️  ⬆️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️
Very nice
How the hell did you pull out that last try, God knows!
The uniform from afar, looks like All blacks Vs England.
New Zealand is so good it can play itself and make a competitive game!
Good game.
Crowd cheering but the stands are empty?
Why did the South's try at 2:20 not count on the scoreboard?
What a Beautiful Sport Rugby Is!!!
Well if the Rugby championship doesn't go ahead this season then 2 more games against north vs South would definitely satisfy the fan's hungry for some good rugby you know we kinda staving here lol..
This was the best game for the year for me hahah the plays were awesome!! I actually didn't care who won, both teams were on point haha :)
@whoevereditedthisvid great that you showed all the tries but rugby is more than just someone crossing the line. Also if you are going to show a try which consequently gets disallowed then show that aswell, was super confused after the 2nd mainland try was scored but the points didn't change.
I dont even know who to support...
Last gasp try  - outstanding English victory over the All Blacks!
Doesn't the player on thumbnail looks jesse lingard?
What a game this was! WOW!
https://youtu.be/jGPcySYWR0A
https://youtu.be/WAzUwzV1F3g
Nice clutch kick from Ioane; pity he didn't make the All Blacks though but no doubt he'll be there soon enough.
Forget Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship...this has them all beat
UP THE SOUTH!!!!
of all the dmac errors I've seen, that hopeful pass to no-one is possibly the most dmac.  A tremendous game though. Well played to everyone.
This definitely could have been a 3 match series
Wheres the Reiko Ioane try???
I love how Beaudy is almost completely unfazed at the brawl the breaks out mid-game😂
all ash dixon had to do is throw the ball into the lineout with one minute to go and game over ..but no he couldnt do that could he.
The south win despite the huge disadvantage of having to wear an England Kit.
As a wallabies fan it's just so nice to see NZ team finally lose a game of rugby. But in all seriousness, what a game. This should 100% be a 3 game Series.
Un saludo desde la sierra de Madrid a todos los rugberos del Mundo.    El final del partido es de infarto
Messiii.messi,😚☺
What a lovely game of rugby!  Springbokke must remain to stay strong!
Thanks New Zealand for keeping us entertained during this thought time of no rugby hope to play you guys again soon 🙏🏿🤙🏿🇿🇦
It was like watching a Grey Bloem vs Paul Roos match. Great speed at the breakdown.
You can tell which team the commentators are supporting just by listening to their energy levels on each try lmao
Great game of rugby - 🇿🇦
Great game overall but honestly for me it lacked physicality, especially the North side with that many tackle busters and heavy hitters in their lineup I expected to be jumping off the couch🙆🏾‍♂️. Awesome game👌🏾💫 though
This is just like Qld vs NSW but rugby version plus this is classic rugby from NZ what if they do it 3 times they might have a draw on the last match 😂
Crusader friendly ref's screwed the North.....that last few minutes was just disgraceful.
There's not a single soul in the crowd - they're using canned audience effects to simulate people cheering! 🤣
This game is why I love rugby!
Maul tries are sexy af
WHAT A BRILLIANT MATCH!!!
Anyone else notice it should have been 45-35 to Souths not 38-35
North vs South Korea is a very different game.
Big fat meh. Just couldn't get excited about this game at all.
Frame this match and put it in a museum
In these highlights they completely leave out Ioane's second try, but they include a "try" that was disallowed for truck and trailer…! Is anybody in charge? Personally I think the try should have stood. Exactly the same thing happened in Force Vs Rebels yesterday and the try was allowed.
If they make this a series like state of orgin. Imagine how big it would get the world would be tunned in to watch the series the best Rugby Players in the World and itll be a big financial beneit for NZR.
Go south👍
Riko Ioane is still a cocky, yet trash. The guy needs to relax and get over himself 🤦🏽‍♂️
Sad there was no crowd. Wasted game!
SYSTEM OF A DOWN COVER BY SOUTH EAST ASIAN (Indonesian & Singaporean) https://youtu.be/UMEArSBd1c4 SYSTEM OF A DOWN COVER BY SOUTH EAST ASIAN (Indonesian & Singaporean) https://youtu.be/UMEArSBd1c4 SYSTEM OF A DOWN COVER BY SOUTH EAST ASIAN (Indonesian & Singaporean)  https://youtu.be/UMEArSBd1c4
Go the south island
What a great game! The quality of NZ rugby is exceptional! Possibly the only country that can have 2 national teams that represent the world stage!
These two teams would dominate worldwide. Easily number 1 and 2 in the world.
That was some great footy,as a Saffa i miss the sport so dearly.
No other country can play rugby like NZ
good god it’s tough to watch english premiership rugby after this. absolute masterclass and so open and entertaining. hats off

Can hear the sound of the Crowd? BUT THERE IS NO CROWD !! 😀😀
Can the Wallabies just play against North Island and then South Island instead of playing the All Blacks at full strength
Wow, this was an awesome match !
Will Jordan is the most overrated player in nz rugby
Dam bloody awesome rugby all round great game both sides 👏 👍 👌
Souff in ya mouff 🤣
What a game looks like college rugby on steroids lol
England fan here - that winger Jordan looks like a good player.
Watching this, then watching my Quins today, just a different level of rugby and skill. Incredible NZ!
Some big lads on that field
The North won that. The 5 minutes overtime was to let the South in. There wasn't any injury time to play.
North backline having a field day..potent attack. In the end discipline got the better of them. Other than that wasn't really to phased on who won .
Great stuff!  This is a great throwback to the good old days and I'd like to see another -  Scrap Super Rugby and bring back the full-scale **tours** by the ABs and the Boks!  Tours that used to have 15 or so games and we'd be **riveted** to the TV as the ABs took on Northern Transvaal or Western Transvaal or whoever, plus the Tests!  Same with the Boks - they can come here and play Waikato, Southland, Taranaki plus the Tests.  Super Rugby has had its day.  BRING BACK THE TOURS!
I only saw the highlights, but was the attack just too hard to stop. Or a lot of work is needed on defense patterns?
Should be called the McCaw Cup
Best of the best! That was a fuckin awesome game - well done lads
Is it based on the clubs that they play for or where they were born?
Where is laumpe? I dont see him!!!
Should be an annual event but play best out of 3
World Rugby:Covid 19 will affect                          Rugby..worldwide.  NZ Rugby:Here hold my beer..
Great game!...Well done South...unlucky North👍Im a Hurricanes supporter well done to the boys in the mix!  #NorthsideNzRugby #Allblacks4life Wayne@CapeTownSA
Only thing that could of been better if refs were actually good.. smh
crowd noises no crowd
This just further proofs the crussders are the best team...I wanted laumapi to play
Barrett flying in with his knees at 0:45 prick move. Wondered what Reiko was reacting too. Great game
Incredible game... one to remember & rewatch for a long time....  I think everyone can agree we need to make this a series best of 3 games...
This was rugby at it's best, but one thing for sure Scott must be doing something Crazy all these crusaders playing some great rugby.
Tf is Reiko complaining about after his try?
The most exciting north vs. south clash since the american civil war
The chairs could scream😂
Great match. Haven't seen one of these in decades. Last time was in Napier. We should play these every year. All Blacks vs All Blacks. Some of the best rugby you'll ever watch
WAT A GOOD GAME OF RUGBY  THATS WHY NEW ZEALAND IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
Fantastic game! Hey NZRU - 3 game series North vs South Please! and allow players to elect their eligibility based on their province of birth (one choice)
In my opinion, Jordie Barret is probably the best player in the world.
It’s like an all star game
English fan here. Loads of talent on display. Should get some of them playing in the premiership! Well it benefited that saffers anyway.
Both team were phenomenal 👌. NZ rugby are in the different level which is absolutely perfect 👌👌👌
Can someone tell me how they decide who plays for which side? Aaron Smith on the North-Team und Brad Webber on the South-Team. So it is not about their Super Rugby teams. Is the location of the players' original (grass roots) club crucial?
Will Jordan hats off
Great advert for kiwi rugby.  Great fame
I’m from the south but what a game   Mitch hunt choked the catch all he needed to do was punch the ball not catch
I hate that offcial and his decision always penalty the north
All 61 who disliked this video are Wallabies and England supporters ;) Either of these teams could Win a World cup ;)
Funny how even with a biased ref South still wins
Finally real rugby thanks
How could someone give the thumbs down? What a game... 👍👍👍
So who's starting at 10 for the ABs? Barret or Mo'anga?
I like how they put in fake crowd noise lol
They have to ban white refs in nz. They cant be trusted to not be racist.
What about the north try where they did not even ground the ball pack of cheats they are anyway we won so im happy
Watched this game,and the style was predictable i.e fast and loose.Also,it seemed like tackling was optional.
It should be a 3 match series every year for sure.Massive game 🙌🏽plus it brings the best out the players to compete for positions in the abs.
i whatched the hole thing
The South African boys haven't been playing proper rugby all year, please god I hope we don't have to play an international series/competition before a full super rugby season. We will get absolutely boned if that's the case.
One of the best games of rugby I've watched in recent history. Such high quality and so equal. Looking forward to this tradition going forward
All of them are artists!
Wow, that was amazing. Just wondering if both teams do the missing car keys dance before the match?
Absolute 🔥
Mixed emotions right now, so half of my All Blacks Beat the other half?. But well weighted game and a real arm wrestle
OMG
Selectors must be pleased with this. The breaking of the defensive line by the North with constructed tries, the physicality close to the line, the opportunist reading of play by the outsides. I’m sure they’ll look past the dazzle dazzle to see some of the defensive issues on the insides that were highlighted in the World Cup semi as well. Nothing in it but a penalty kick and a couple of lucky breaks really. Enough for a strong squad of 25.
As an Aussie, a massive congrats to New Zealand rugby. The depth of NZ rugby on display for all to see. 🔥👏
Good game, but what's with the fake crowd noise?
They forgot to add rieko's 2nd try because the score went from 21 to 28 without showing
Nearly a point a minute, at Test level! Which just goes to prove that nobody can hold out the Kiwis when they are attacking. A truly great game. The true thank yous would go all the way to primary schools.
Us South Africans have nothing but admiration for NZ rugby! Wow, this was incredible!
Good vocal crowd at the game....
Tries do not tell the whole story, Ardie’s Savea turn over to save try should .be there
Had no idea this game was on,great to see,hopefully a tradition that will hang around,nz rugby from the top to the bottom of the island is majestic 😉
Great rugby
Best rugby game of the year..
This is the best Rugby match in the Whole World.The best of the best ...separated into two......and play against each other. Priceless showdown.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Jordie Barrett is a monster tackler. Stood up Aikira who had a 20 meter build up. Impressive
52 people gave it a thumbs down  . .  what does it take to please some fckers
Canterbury
Both these teams would flog us here in Australia. You could probably add “East, West” teams and they’d still beats us by 30 😂
I don't get it first if was a forward pass by the south and then offside by south🤦‍♀️
They should do this once a year. Fantastic match. With a crowd even better, the skill and dedication just shone through, loved it
Wow amazing match
Absolutely brilliant match from start to finish..
Jordan Air👍
Up the South Island 💪🏼😎 🏆🏆
also 5:50 he didn't check the grounding with tmo the ref didn't see the grounding a bit biest
2:11 poor decision
Great crowd
muy buen nivel de rugby en ambos equipos fue un gran partido
Wow what a game! Please make this a series. It’ll be the rugby equivalent of state of origin. I’m sure it’ll fill up stadiums. Stay safe NZ!
What a great crowd, all wearing yellow though 🤷🏼‍♂️
I knew south would win will Jordan’s try at the end was a legendary try he will be in the all blacks north did good north was offside like 5 times and ref saw and he did not count it as a offside and when south could not pass the ball someone on north was blocking it making it unfair for south to pass it Jordan’s try’s were the best and Jordie Barrett kicks were epic but all teams did good OOOOOOOOO HE DID IT THE WAS MAGIC AND SOUTHS WINS
Brad Weber needs to go lower when he carry the ball lol, always getting held in the air by the opposition, if he go against the physicality of the northern hemisphere, no chance the ball will keep rolling lol.
I'm from the South my team won and my team lost thanks the team of 30 plus reserves & coaching staff what a game.
So basically this is just a  All Blacks vs All Blacks
Tremendous match. I loved it.
At least North beat south alot
What a game!!
*Reiko* sown up the 13 Jersey. Looks dangerous asf every time he touches the ball.
*Jordan* with the last play may have won the 14 Jersey off Reece.
*DMaC* still the Best 15. Always sniping the gaps.
How come the barrets play on different teams?
They should look into making this like an origin series, could be something special!
You missed Ioane's 2nd try
Lovely match But what if Sony bill was there😂
この試合マジでアツかった！！🔥
That chip from Josh Ioane 💪
Up the south
I'm jealous of the talent that NZ has wow great players
What a match. Thanks NZ Rugby
fake crowd noise lol
Much love from Hayward CA.. Was up all night watching this great match..
какая странная, но интересная игра...)) хочу в new zeland!
best rugby players in the world, well done boys to both teams, big love from the uk xxx
the fake crowd noise ws rather pathetic but enjoyed the rugby.
I initially thought the North was too much for the South but I forgot this is 2020. Everything goes south!
This is what I love about NZ rugby. They ain’t afraid to try anything either it be to shut the game out or snatch victory as was the case with this game. AMAZING😃
And that my friend is a good as Rugby! 💪😤
OMG😱 This was legendary, never seen this kind of match, rugby fan forever 🤘🤘🏉 🏉
Beauden and D-Mac are two of the most popular players but it's got to be said that *currently* there are players who are pushing for the 10 and 15 their positions more than them right now. Also why does Rieko Ioane look like he's got a hard drugs problem?
Mckenzie and Jordan is absolutely brilliant ❤
Jordan’s shoulder charge is the nonsense that got the ABs a loss
Battle for flyhalf settled. BB all the way.
state of origin shits on Rugby....don't ever compare this rubbish to the mighty maroons vs the blues series
I knew it was going to be tight but was hoping for a North win. Well done South Island
Jordie Barrett may soon be better then his brother
What's with the fake crowd cheering? There's no one there except the players
I told my friends those men from the south are not gonna be easy haha 😂
Brilliant 👏
Overall: Heartbreaking.  On a specific note: What was Caleb Clarke thinking?!
Well that was like something out of a fantasy land, great game. Hopefully we see more stuff like this in the future. Good thing for the rugby world that the two islands of NZ is one country!
Three match State of Origin like series??
Strong from both sides.
All blacks vs all Whites (not soccer)
Absolutely epic. I hope North v South can go annually.
5:04 Jordie's Step
Wait so... no audience and there's crowd cheering? 😂
How come the Barret brothers are on different teams? Surely there both from either north or south. (Not a New Zealander)
Is that fake crowd noises?😂😂
Ta'vao got waxed by Jordie @5.04 LOL
Lol watching all the way from Iraq Its hard to pick a side instead rooted for both of them, high level rugby
Why all white players play with the south ? And vice versa ? Just wondering
Wow I love NZ rugby no one plays like you guys#simplythebest  from Cape Town RSA
The fact that there was no crowd there basically negated how good this game was. Whose ever decision it was to have an empty stadium, you are a disgrace and an embarrassment. Shame on you.
About as close as we going to get to test rugby this year
Guess Jordie Barrett’s the starting fullback now. That’s nzs best kicker got the deepest range.......
Reiko reminded us of the player he was before 2019. This is probably his position now to lose. That Sanders was a bit new to me. Will Jordan came thru in the 2nd half at least. As always, I thought Aaron Smith speeded the North's game when he came on.
Love the crowd cheers even though the stands r empty 🤣🤣 great kiwi humour 🤣🤣
Mounga > BB
I didn't hope less from these teams, that game joined rugby elite. It was amazing. Congratulations and great match! Unfortunately I couldn't see it live. Greetings from Mexico. 🏆👏🇳🇿🇲🇽
4:13 I'm a fan of Damian McKenzie, but he utterly butchered this prime opportunity. It was 4 on 1, for goodness sake.
Game of the year, hands down.
The cheering from the empty stands is really loud.
Beauden north, Jordie south? Y?
Again the Northern Hemisphere sides just do not play like this.  I also see All-Blacks coming back and NZ rugby is in way awesome shape.
Everything about NZ rugby > AU Rugby
All Blacks backline: 15 Jordie Barrett, 14 Will Jordan, 13 Rieko Ioane, 12 Jack Goodhue, 11 Caleb Clarke, 10 Richie Mo'unga 9 Aaron Smith. Reserves: Brad Weber, Beauden Barrett, Anton Lienert-Brown. Unlucky to miss out: Braydon Ennor, Damian McKenzie, Peter Umaga-Jensen, George Bridge.
Just quality everywhere in NZ rugby. Head and shoulders above anyone else with skill,in my opinion. Someone was being particularly difficult that I didn't specify this so I have 😊
We hanged in there till overtime..🙄 congrats south. Rematch please.
How does the selection process work? Sevu Reece(plays for crusaders) but is in the north team? Same goes for Aaron smith? Just asking tho
So brilliant to watch - would have loved to see the whole game ... From  Rugby starved Wales
Enjoyed that - especially the second half.
What a game 😍
What a game! I love&respect NewZealand rugby from Japan!
Surprised North didn't dominate this game with all the hitters they had 😂
Wtfff this is not amical match this is Final World cup Level !!!!
Dream teams rugby
うますぎる
YEAH SOUTHSIDE, What a game NZ rugby is just unbelievable levels,  best in the business
Something about this footage is very off-putting. I was sure it was sped up (I don't think it was as the coverage clock seems to match real time). Can anyone inform? Is it the frame rate?
Wow wow wow. This is rugby
Always wondered why people say to me.. there's a fierce rivalry between the north island and south island in N.Z isn't there.. im like ummmm.. no😂 not that i know of hhhhh.. oh you mean in rugby hhh.. we like to beat ourselves hhhhh..
Can't wait to watch the replay  A) used to think Jordie was overrated but ever since his huge tackle for the canes I've realized  I was wrong  B) rieko looks like a douche when stands over his opponents looking down on them; especially Jordie on the kick try; you only finished a great kick and its not like you dominated him there.
Blacks had the better backs, white had the better forwards
Congrats to the South team.. 🏉💪🏿 Well deserved boys👏🏿👊🏿
This is 🔥
meanwhile: Leinster and Munster are afraid to off load. Chalk and cheese.
so did they both do the haka before the match started🤔
Lol
Bs ref
Go north
Where’s Rieko second try.?
Crowd of ghosts were making some noise! Bet lots of ghost chips and ghost beer went down as well...
This should be a yearly thing.
Funny how everyone thought that the North’s forward pack were gonna dominate the South’s forward pack... this game showed otherwise
Best game of the year!
If they make this a regular fixture, you reckon nz players from overseas should come and play?
Truly fantastic rugby! Adore and respect from Japanese. In the match I think McKenzie is showing small players can success and I want to see him playing in All Blacks!
Absolutely majestical . A complete Heart stopping ,edge of seat game of footy. Both teams were world class. What a great headache for fozz & co... Up the ABs
one team was good at running with the ball and the other was good at sticking their head up peoples arsess
No that's a game
Such fun. Uso against Uso. LOVE IT
Fake crowd noise reminds me of canned laughter in sitcoms
Christ what a game!
The skill and depth of NZ rugby is on another level! Well done from South Africa 👊🏻
Hi guys can anyone tell me who the coach for the south ia
Sheer force of Will!
Let's have 2 more games
Awesome game well NZ rugby always is but three games be so good aye
Rest of the World TAKE NOTE ...You have just witness NZ RUGBY at it's FINEST .So who has the HONOR of making the ALL BLACKS ?
This is going to upset people.... I wouldnt start Beauden in my Test side, Smith 9, Mounga 10, Bridge 11, ALB/Goodhue? 12, Ioane 13, Reese 14 and Jordie 15. Jordies defence has really impressed
Where's rieko ione's second try bro thats very rude.It's like something done on purpose
Great game!
7 minutes?? Not Enough Best V Best We need at least 15minutes  Extended Highlights!!!!
Well it should be the South's turn to wear the black jersey next year.
will jordan take a bow
Norths better they only got tries from scrum
How come the barret brothers are playing different feams
Now that is Rugby!
Lol that crowd was pretty loud
Spectacular. Highest quality rugby.
What a  bullshit finish.
Go the south....produced great players.
The two best teams in world rugby. Really was the North's game I have to say, that sideline flick back in field really was a garbage giveaway try. Great game though, lots of talent on display
I honestly dont even know the rules of rugby but I have loved since I first watched a game. From sevens to Rugby X ive loved it all. I love all the players from Newzeland especially guys like SBW ,McKenzie ,Ruby Tui and Lomu. THIS GAME MEANS A LOT FOR ME.
Lets do this every year .. gooo the south side boys
Some really classy play from both teams, what a coup de grace in the end!
smith still a god
Nothing on Leinster Vs Munster
Wtf North last try not even checked.
A winner : the All blacks. They have 2 great team !
Air Jordan must be trending in NZ right now 😎
Ended up more like a Crusaders vs Blues game... with the crusaders edging in the last quarter as usual : )
Why is Jordie Barrett ( Hurricanes) playing for South and Aaron Smith ( Highlanders) playing for North?
All blacks have 2 team To win the world cup !
Awesome game but totally needs to be 3 matches
Imagine being in the all blacks and losing to the all blacks at the same time
I hope this becomes an annual game
Jordie Barrett making noise💯
Missed out ioanes 2nd?
Insane match brilliant to watch
What a game
What’s with the stupid crowd sound effects!!!
barrett vs barrett
Have so much respect for NZ rugby..
That match was just 🙀🔥 Origin vibes!! We need official supporters gears for next game haha fkn See you Souths next one! 🤨👊🏽
Wanted the North to win.  What a game.  Quite special.
What n game the best versus the best grade game from both  teams.
Awesome. Smokin' South !!!  This is why I have always preferred to watch and follow NZ rugby for 48 years. Magic with a rugby ball.
Man would’ve been nice if i was there Like if you wanted to be there
we need 2 more matches
Will Jordan the best young rugby player rn
McKenzie is rubbish
Superb thankyou North and South
Great game from both sides a clear demonstration of talent in NZ
Will Jordan a freak....bloody amazing...next AB
So much respect for new zealand rugby from a South African 🏉🙏
what a awesome game .. they`r ALL BLACKS at the end of the day
Air Jordan FTW!
lmao they even included the disallowed try at 2:10 . To all people that didnt watch the full game, thats not a given try, thats how shameful the decision was.  And at 5:46 , the ball actually was held as shown by the replay moment, but the reff decides to directly reward the try and not go to the tmo decision lmao.
Why no brown ref
Shot crusaders
Amazing game
Why Dixon why wind or no wind!!!!!
bloody hell, what a game. Hope to see this in full
Ash Dixon is an idiot!!! Sorry but that ruined Not the chance after 'll that hard work I just knew after his throw in something was bound to happen. Now we have to wait for next year you idiot!!!
Ash Dixon is a bafoon all he had to do was throw it bloody straight that's all North would of held onto the ball for the last minute. Thanks Dixon awesome bro
You couldn't write this...
How sad it is to see an empty stadium because of a global scam and at the same time how ridiculous it is to listen to the sound effects as if there was a real crowd cheering for the players.
Great game, very pity what only one game,not a series :(((
First
Can we have two All Blacks team...in Black & White?...seems to be a waste of talents....asking for a fren...🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
What a try by will Jordan
Ash Dixon one job🤦🏼‍♂️
Why they never show Rieko's 2nd try?
make this a 3 match series
Hopefully, none of the trophies were broken this time...
A Big FAT Congratulations to the awesome South Island Team. Awesome players Will Jordan, Jordie Barrat, Richie Maunga & all their smart awesome team mates. Magnificient display of our Rugby Players, wonderful game.
Good win the South but what a game aswell
bloody South Island refs
"Only NZ RUGBY thanks" Well done South, from a North supporter 👍
Who’s doing the crowd effects... 👌 lol
So south won, otherwise talking points would be disallowed Taylor try and Dixon try, which obviously not grounded
What a game!
Crowd noise was awful. It is like laugh track in a sitcom
YEAH BOYS
Can we please , have the Full March ?
Where was Beaudy, barely featured in highlights??
Great match between the all blacks and the all blacks 🤣
They missed out on Rieko Ioane's 2nd try
Great game. Replay value 10000000x.
Why is this not a 3 match series I want one my god.
Will jordan What a player
Was just searching the web for highlights of the game with zero results then this popped up. Thank you
What a game, Richie Mo'unga and Jordie Barrett were a class above the rest.
What a game
Up the Blues 💙 🤍
compare this rugby to the munster v Leinster game last night.. worlds apart!
Who's your All Blacks playing 23?  Mine would be: Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Tuipolutu, Whitelock, Frizel, Savea, Sotutu, Smith, B. Barrett, Goodhue, R. Ioane, Reece, Jordan, D Mac    Subs: Mo'unga, A. Ioane, T. Lomax, Dunshea, Weber,, Aumua, J Barrett, Clarke
