Concretes  on your  baby boy❤❤❤❤
People On July 3 2025:
This is so amazing also it’s incredible that your son had his eyes open so fast when my mom had me she said I didn’t open my eyes for a day
Aww how sweet now let's call you a POS because of what you named your child !!! Like you get a fuck!n say!!! Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves and your stupid opinions!!! And her babies name wasn't even that bad that you had the right to have people making fun OF A BABY!!
The doctor I was like push Abby push was literally yelling at her
Congratulations Abby I wish you another son too ❤❤❤.
your strong abby you can do this and congrats to your first baby i am so proud that you changed my day❤❤❤😊😊
Congratulations on your baby boy he is so cute
Be brave Abby 🎉🎉
Be brave Abby 🎉🎉
omg that’s so wild!!!! the baby just came out of you 🥹🥹🥹🥹🦋🦋
Can he SHUT UP!!! How annoying!!
Not asking for knuckles while she’s crying it pisses me off
Congratulations mom and
5:26 you probably know now but shaking is very normal once you get an epidural bc of the hormones and the sudden switch of your body and also adrenaline so you don’t have to be worried at all ab that
🫣
Beautiful ❤️
Matt is annoying & Abby deserves so much better.
you got this
Matt was way over the top with the support, to the point of obnoxious and annoying. I am surprised Abby did not yell at him to stop.
Shut up man !!!
Bhaiya
I swear if a man was saying that while I was giving birth I would ask him to leave
Its been 2 years guys im so happyyy for youuu!!!💙
OK, I would have asked the nurse to remove my husband before I knocked him out! Too much is to much! Very sweet though!+
Congrats 🥺👍
I love these videos so damn much, but it makes me so sad I didn't get to hold my girl after she was born 😞 I'm glad they prioritized her health and got her to the nicu but it still makes me sad to this day.
its the best day bc on the exackt same day your mom has bday yall will be the best parents
I’m 15 years by the way so
My brother just got married to An Abby not too long ago and I could never see them have kids but if they do one day I’d be like you guys never talk to me again
I'm never having a baby. This is all so scary!!!
The doctors sounded so mean in the intro 😂
Horrendous that we've normalized birth that looks like this.
خوب
He sounds so obnoxious. I would be embarrassed.
YO WHY AM I BAWWWWLING RIGHT NOW?!
Im not crying youre crying. This is too beautiful. 😢
Two weeks from my due date with baby boy and just bawled my eyes out watching this 😭💙 so sweet
My mom gave birth to me and my 2 siblings but we all had to be born by a c section🥺 I feel bad that she had to have 3 surgeries.
He’s talking to her like she’s a freaking child!!!! Annoying af!!
È stato emozionante vedere vedere questo video : vi ho appena conosciuti e desidero seguire la vostra bellissima famiglia ,cominciando a commentare dalla nascita del vostro amato primo bambino 😊 È un piacere conoscervi Abby e Matt 🥰

It was 2 years ago but , this is so cute ... Like you're so strong and brave and your husband is so loving and caring and i liked how he's helping you ❤❤❤
Nnnb
I love how supportive Matt was, but honestly couldn’t help but think just shut up already 😅
He’s obnoxious
I was very shaken after birthing…and that night
Why did they have her flat on her back while trying to hold her head up and push? Aw he’ll no
Why is she going shhhh?
Can we appreciate how supportive mat is ❤
Abby you are amazing. Congratulations to both of you. ♥️🥰
Matt needed to STFU, seriously.  He’s extremely annoying and he never seems sincere.
Aww look at baby griffin
God bless you all have that baby and you be a great mom
Hello
❤❤❤ 🎉🎉🎉
Could he sound any faker. Youre so strong youre so brave.
So you love the child SO much you leave them locked up in a black out tent in a cruse cabin.  Uh huh.  Cancelled.
I love you guys
12:57 your birth story is soo similar to mine. Had so much nostalgia.
Aw baby the birth shakes are so real
Hi
Congratulations 🎉🎉❤❤❤
The husband was putting on such a show
Ofcourse mat doesn’t shut his mouth and makes it all about himself
How sweet are they? I literally told my husband that he wasn’t getting near me again when I was in labour!
I also get the shaking shaking is just anxiety and stress building up and it is all let’s all out at once
Matt’s celebration dance 😂😂😂😂😂
Congratulations
Man… he was annoying!
Ngl this made me so scared but so exited for childbirth and both at the same time😂😭
Mattttttt, you're the best. Matttttt! ❤❤❤ So proud of your parents that they raised such a good....YOU!!
No man can be like him. He is just the best of the best, man! How he's cheering for her at the start of the video.. Already took my heart away!
Oh shut up already 😂
Happy 2nd birthday, Griffin!
Congrats Abby and Matt
Abby you did it
Omg I hope I get a man just like Matt. I’m so happy for you guys and I love how he is so supportive to you❤
The nurse was soo rude to Matt he didn't do anything but just encourage Abby and hold onto her leg to support her ❤
That one part where Abby says “oh my gosh. Oh heavens 😂😊
I can’t believe I’m watching this again when griffin is now 2 yrs old❤❤
I. Love  you Abby   ❤❤
Guys yesterday griffin turned 2😭😭😭😭

Anotber exploitative birtg vlog!! Yayyy!!!! Such an intimate moment being filmed and served on a platter for ALL to enjoy! What a great idea!!! 👍
I love how many times Matt said “your so strong Abby”
He so nice but I would not want to here that lol
I have a question how does a person break a pregnant woman’s water
You were so good Abby and mat you were so soportived
https://www.youtube.com/@DollzForLife
Why does it always look so easy to give birth? Like is it painful or not? I know if it’s a big baby it’s painful but it could be painful either way.
In the era of green falg and red falg Matt is a complete evergreen forest ❤️
I've never clicked on a video faster😂😂
I’m sorry to ruin the mood but I love how Matt said “NooOoOooOo” when Abby said she wanted chick fila  and it was a Sunday 😂
I love you baby. I love you baby. So precious she kept saying that. ❤
What is his name
This was really beautiful. I give birth in July also and I’m terrified lol
He has the same birthday as me😊❤❤❤
Like after one and a half year I got to know that your first child and I share birth dates 😭 he is exactly 15 years younger than me ❤
The way matt was saying it
I’m dehydrated 😭❤
I just wanna say that,I saw your first video on 17th Jan of 2024 about  your 2nd baby pregnancy checking,on seeing that ,my curiosity raised to watch your first baby birth,so I searched for it and finally I saw this beautiful video ❤ But then I got shocked 😮becoz the birth date of your cutie pie ❤is same of mine ,I born in July 3 2003🫂I wish all good things to your baby❤I pray for  your cutie pie♥️Love you lots❤️🫂
When I was in labor, I didn't want anyone touching me! When I'm in pain, I want it quiet and left alone! 🤣
Mean
Poor kid😭
Ohhhh❤❤❤❤❤ I cried , it was so emotional and full of love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Рождение ребенка - божественное чудо!
I know matt is being so sweet 😂 but irritating at the same time women can be frustrated by these things at this time or even in periods your presence is enough we don't want to hear these things these are real annoying 😂😂
Congratulations 🎉 everyone needs a husband like Matt
Be nice! Lavisdizz!
I'd he was born 1 day earlier WE WOULD SHARE BIRTHDAYS
I love your sweet baby❤❤❤
https://youtube.com/@Dard8888?si=ndOQRyYzizIQXihu
Hi I am a little bit shy right now right now because it’s my first time ever watching your videos by hey Siri, you were crying because you were trying to get a baby but the day you’re giving birth to a baby, so no need to worry about that anymore I know I know it’s a boy and his name is Griffin.
Bruh I can’t with the husband like say something other than you’re strong you’re strong you’re strong
OMG ! Someone tell Matt to Shut Up …. How fake!
Congratulations, You guys are amazing
I wanted to see the actual thing
Matt is too loveable and I love it. Plus her legs were all the way up
Laying on back like this to push a baby out will never make sense…
Ko
6:05 Imagine the nurses walked in while matt was just dancing around on the chair
I love Matt he’s the sweetest little man love you guys so much
This still makes me cry today love you guys 🥹😊
Ikr Matt is saying ur are so strong Abby but I like that he is so supportive but he has to SHUT UP 😅
Matt is a keeper and amazing husband. I cried watching this 😅 It was really touching 😊 Abby is a lucky mama and wife 😊
Matt, isn’t it such a miracle from God how life begins and then how the baby is born? I love it. It’s the most special, beautiful, miraculous Gift from God!
What a sweet miracle from God!!❤
He’s so supportive but I would forsure be telling him to shut up while pushing 😂a lot of apologies afterwards too 😂😂😂
😂😂😂matt
Pp
Matt. What are you doing
They are not courageous to show the clear video,is just like play, how ever congrats
Abby you’re doing great you’re so strong and Matt is so helpful❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
bro is enjoing it
good job
hard work pays off!!!!
I cracked up when Matt thought he got himself grape jello but it was prune juice🤣 what a disappointment!
SHUT UP Matt
Who’s here after little Auggies birth 🎉
THEY ARE THE BEST CUTEST DUO 6:05
Abby is the most adorable mom!! And Matt is such an amazing husband and dad. Now they have 2 beautiful baby’s 🥹❤️
Who’s here after Auggie?❤️🥺
MashaAllah
Why was the doctors gonna get her so loudly?
why rush and induce labor instead of just letting it come?
I like how Matt is being supportive but he really has to SHUT UP because he is saying u r so strong to much but I am not saying anything bad lol
If I was matt I would say flip just flip
I'm on my 3rd child with my husband....he was amazing with the birth of both of my kids.. our son is autistic...I am just hoping for a healthy baby xoxox
Congratulations ❤❤❤❤
Shaking is super common in labour! More women shiver then don’t!
Congratulations on your new baby
What an amazing journey. Well done Abby
And now August is born 🥲🥹
Who’s here after baby #2 was born 👇
She missed her Chick-fil-A day😂😂😂😂😮😮😮
Bro those nurses😭😭people be saying for Matt to shut up but those darn nurses needa stop yelling like Matt was so supportive and he right she is so strong and was doing great but those nurses don't make it better. You did so great abby and you will be the best mom and matt was so supportive 💗 💖
Who else is Waching this when she is having her second
You guys should not be posting this because little kids watch this and they don't know what it is
Who is coming after the second baby 🎉❤
You're going to have two babies one girl one boy I just predicted the future
Don’t like when doctors intervene I’m sure your water would’ve broke once you’ve dilated more
Addy is so strong I’m so glad for you
Congrats well done abbey you did amazing hope your fine and everything's OK with little man
I’m so glad moms have gotten so much better at teaching their sons to be good fathers!
This should not be on the internet. You’re exploiting this child.
If my husband won’t be like Matt I will say bye
Who else was here cause you thought it was there second
It’s crazy thst she just had her second baby❤🎉
Second baby's birth video might get more views as their channel was 3 million on Griffin's time and Augusts Time it's 5 million soo don't brag about that baby boy... Okay 😂 ... I'm talking to a person who's not even born yet 😂😂😂
Thanks for sharing your birth story. Y’all are so very sweet.
Abby is amazing, in that pain she still care to respond.
who the h8ll is recording this❤
If I had a man saying that when I gave birth to my sons, I would have clocked him.  This was the 60's, no epidural, nada and some dude saying knuckles😂😂😂
Why Abby will have a c section now?
Same birthday
𝐋𝐨𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐨𝐈'𝐦 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐲  𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐲𝐨𝐮
Why am I crying 😂 omg I can’t wait to experience this with my future husband. I wish every woman could experience this with a man who loves her like this. ❤
This was like a year ago crazy❤

He’s beautiful
Congrats guys
Matt was saying  good job honey I would have been like shut the heck up like sideye

No it's not no it's not true
I haven't cried so much over a youtube video before
Wht did he cut off
Matt is so supported right now but i don't know why he have to shut up
How sweet is Matt telling Abby how strong she is
Girl you are awesome remember that ?
Does it annoy anybody else that they always uses white towel at hospitals because they get sooooo dirty lol
I kind of fell like Matt is sweet but I’d be like Matt thank u for supporting me but I am going in labour now
I love how Matt  so sweet but I would be like SHUT UP CAN YOU PLEASE GO OUT NOW
Pitocin contractions are so much worse than regular contractions.

My eyes full of tears❤❤ from india
Oh Matt, enough is enough!!🤫
Erggggg matt is making me so uncomfortable 😂😂😂😂 he's super cringe!!!! I bet the nurses were like I wish he would stfu😂😂😂😂

Congratulations 🎉❤
U have to give credit to matt he's so sweet🎉🎉
It’s my bday too ahhhhh bday twins
Griffin has the same birthday as my dad!
even when the doctors somewhat shouted at Matt to let then have Abby's legs, he didn't shout or get upset, probably to make sure Abby stayed calm. He is so thoughtful and always has Abby in mind. love you guys x
I know Matt was a little bit chatty during the labor, but I think it’s because in was genuinely FREAKIN’ OUT inside 😅 —That’s why he kept repeating himself over and over and over again lol!  He did an amazing job supporting & encouraging Abby, and i just know he’ll do an amazing job during Abby’s next delivery!!  Congratulations Abby & Matt 💟
I’m very confused about how in. A lot of the birth videos I’ve seen people haven’t been allowed to eat?? I ate 3 meals everyday I was there
I love how Matt was right there with her the whole time confronting her ya'll are going to be such a cute family
11 days after my bros bd

Push baby
Whos here when Griffin has just turned 1 and Abby is about to have her 2nd baby!

Definitely an epidural birth lol , great job momma

Congratulations 🥳
Oh I thought there would be 11 months between Griffin and the new little one 😅
It’s hard to believe he just turned 1

Happy birthday Griffan can’t believe your one!❤
Happy Birthday Griffin 🎉
This just popped up in my feed - I didn't follow them last year - and I'm crying!  Abby did such a great job and so did dad...his cheerleading was so great.  And, if she would have told him to stop, he would have but that's what she needed and it got her through.  I wish this family many, many years of growing love and smiles for miles.
I'm literally watching this on July 3rd, 2023 🙂
It makes sense that the nurse called Matt daddy Cut the child is literally being born but it still sounds weird
Why did yall have to go to the hospital so early?
Who’s behind the camera Matt’s mom or Abby’s?
Thank you for sharing this magical moment with us🤗💖💖💖
Hey guys it’s Ryleigh. And now this little guy will become an official big brother to a little brother in just a couple of months. And also will be turning a year old in less then a week I know that now because I saw the short you guys posted today that one day not that long ago when you Abby was done breastfeeding Griffin that she was going to officially stop breastfeeding him completely. Because she said in that short that he will be a year old in less then a week. How is griffin going to be a year old in less then a week he is growing up way too fast. It seems like he was just born yesterday and now in less then a week that will have been a year ago. Can’t believe how fast he has grown. Baby boy number 2 whatever his name will be will grow up so fast as well. He will be born and then boom before you know it he will be turning 1. Can’t wait to hear the name of baby boy number 2. So love you guys love Ryleigh.
Congratulations
Matt I love that you are so supportive. However, shut your pie hole. Said with love.
My husband was silent and present. If he had talked non stop like that I would have punched him in the face. Seriously.
He’s making me nervous, be quiet for a while
I love how Matt is encouraging Abby, and then there's the screaming at her to push. Lol 😂
How do we clone Matt😂😂😂
So so so beautiful 🥰🥰🦋🕊️
Matt’s dancing lol 😂
i would have to tell him to shut up 😭😭
OMGGGGGG!!! HE IS SO BUETIFULL! EDIT: SORRY IF I SPELLED THAT WORD Wrong
i love how he is encouraging her throughout the birth but if my husband kept saying “ur so strong” over and over i would be like STFU 💀
Good job abby
Congrates 12:59
Oh my God,matt was so awesome and that encouragement was wonderful,his amazing and she did such a fantastic job
bro Matt just goofing off and dancing, would totally be my bf, Abby you did AWSOME!! i'm so glad that you, Matt, and your baby are healthy! you are so blessed to have a wonderful husband who supported you through this! I wish you and your family great health and joy! I can't wait too see what the future holds for you guys!  Love always,   kayleigh
Poor Abby I know she is going through alot god bless her
awwww
His name is griffin
Matt does the literal bare minimum any man should do and gets all the praise. What is wrong with society
お母さん頑張った😢❤😂お疲れ様😊❤
I would  want him to shut up to
It was 7:43pm when it said they were born on that time lol
I am sitting here and push too 1 23 4
Maty is so nice but if a dude was talking like this next to me giving birth i would give em a litteral bitch slap
Matt is so sweet and caring while the doctor is  barking orders. I think that nurse/doctor would have stressed me out but maybe some people find her voice motivating like a coach
I started crying watching this it is so sweet I am so happy for you 😢❤❤!
Matt I hope you teach your boys how to take care of your queen.  You are amazing!!  Love Love Love Abby!!
This so so cute, glad there all okay and healthy x
I had this on and my husband said jess turn that off its so cringey when mat wss saying "your so strong" over and over 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had to be flipped because a was feet first 😂😂
I would tell him to shut up
man cant wait till i get my own kid
I was 8 centimeters dilated when I got to the hospital, so I did most of my laboring at home and didn’t even know it.  I got the epidural at 8 centimeters but I was so far into labor and it didn’t work. Matt, you are so supportive and loving. Ya’ll are the cutest together🩷!!!
If we earned 1,000 dollars for how much Matt good job I would be a billionaire
Bro but I feel like instead of Doctors birthing it should be a nurse 10:59 AM
Thank you for sharing this special moment with us❤
I'm literally crying.... not only seeing the pain....but seeing the amount of love care and support and strength they give to each other as a partner..... honestly if I get a husband like this.... I'll be the luckiest girl .... everyone deserves a life partner like them.....🥹💕
I think Matt was great helping Abby. All husbands should be this way.
Ngl I was annoyed by the woman who was like “PuSh PuSh AbBy PuSh
What happend to her?
That's so cool I was also born on July 3rd but I was born in 2010
I’m sorry but Matt is so annoying 😂
That moment abby screamed, you know she just wanted to get the baby out because of how much pain that is
Wow i just bawled my eyes out.
Congratulations so happy for u both🥳  May ur son stay healthy 🧿😍
Matt is the sweetest helping Abby through the birth !!!
If not this I would not marry ! ❤
Matt is so sweet too her omggg
His birthday is 2 day after mine! ❤
i personally i think matt was too supportive but it was really cute abby is really lucky to have him
I swear I’d I were Abby I would appreciate how sweet Matt was being but I would slap him in the face 😅
*
Do they have a P.o. box ????
I remember when they were getting married and now they’re having kids
Omg women have been doing this  since  the beginning of time jo big deal.  ......
Matt is so sweet like comforting u Abby and he is so supportive
Sar I have a good one is a few things to go back 🔙

I teared up sooo bad congratulations ❤️❤️
Shit friggin hurts! We women are warrior's ❤
When Abby said oh i love you so much sweet baby I was like omg she is amazing
If that were my husband and he kept talking id want to punch him in the face. He is so annoying
After turning and turning, squeezing my husbands hand, saying… I will never do this again! The next morning I told him, Nothing to it! Then 3 more.
Poor Matt was so excited about is grape Jello then he went from 😋 to 😫 because it was prune juice justice for the jello
Love u guys 🫶🏽🫶🏽❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations u guys💙🫶🏽🫶🏽
You can already tell that Matt and Abby will be amazing parents😊😊😊
Abby I know it was hard for you But you did Great Your baby boy we love you and love you And be so blessed To have you As a mom Like you
Wait wait- so did you pick a day to have your baby? Why not just wait for your water to break naturally?
OMG I'm surprised they didn't tell him to stfu!
Womanhood is Abby birthing a baby and Matt getting all the compliments in the comments haha

I am so proud of you 🙂☺️😀😆🥹😇😍🥰😘😝😜🤪
His reaction when Abby told Matt it was time! Priceless!

Aww July 3rd is my birthday
Everyone has their own coach when having their baby.  But, goodness! Even tho Matt meant well. He would've driven me crazy! Tooooo much of "your so strong, your so strong" ugh.
Omg Matt is literally the most sweetest husband ever!!! Like the entire time he kept encouraging her and telling her how strong and brave she was and how great she was doing. 😌 Girls get you a mans like Matt!!! 😝
I absolutely love this! I unfortunately didn’t have the greatest experience with the epidural. So it was quite painful. And then my sons left should also got stuck and ended up having a shoulder dystocia injury. And a couple days after his birth, I was re-emitted for severe preeclampsia.   I pay next time around it will go more smoothly now that I know I cannot get an epidural. And I will make sure from the beginning of pregnancy I do better with taking care of my health. Somehow I feel like I mommy food choices and lack of exercise contributed to the outcome of me having preeclampsia which it may not have been the case but still. I carry that guilt that I know I should have done better for myself and my son. But he is doing absolutely great and has made great improvements with his left arm. We still aren’t out of the woods yet with him but we are getting there.
I‘m Form Germany and a lot of women do Thea birth without Andy epidural. It‘s facinating to See, that you planend it.
Haha whatever it is they give us before the epidural really does make you so high it feels awesome
July 3rd is also my birthday! So happy for your second baby!!
Matt is the best husband anyone could ever ask for 😊
Omg I would have told Matt to shut the fuck up lol
12 minutes and 59 seconds of pure joy and happiness
😍😍😍😍
• Aloha Dudes!!
I love how I opened the video and the first thing I heard was Matt affirming Abby and cheering her on ❤❤ I know I'm several months late but congratulations you guys 🎉🎉🎉
this is  so pure and heartwarming!! I cry so much!!!
Congratulations 🎉❤
An amazing❤ vid for griffin to watch back at ❤
His reaction when Abby said are you ready to have a baby so genuine and awesome
I’m literally in tears. You’re so lucky Abby ❤. 🎉
Omg he's so. Cute and his birthday is the day before mine!!
I hope you do better with your next child btw congratulations 🎊 for Griffin ( A little while ago ) ❤❤❤
the way he keeps saying you are so strong abby is so annoying god
"At this point I just wanna watch Breaking Bad and eat pancakes." Mood.
Omg my heart ♥️
Everyone deserves this much of caring husband
The way he is repeating and repeating and repeating would drive me crazy when in labour..
God,this is a horror movie! You're suckin' the life out of your wife's soul,bro' with your endless chaterrin!!!! First &Last Time i m watching you!!
Crying so hard!! I'm 33 weeks pregnant and can't wait❤
I just can't believe that you guys shared such an intimate moment with the whole world of Youtube. I didn't learn this much about pregnancy and giving birth in school. Thank you! You guys are super brave! Congratulations!!
You two are so cute together I wish when I'm older I'll have a boyfriend like you abby and matt❤ millie
I’m so so proud of you guys!!!
As me
Omg finally someone with the same birthday
I think this was one of the most sweetest birthing vlogs. Matt you are truly a wonderful husband to Abby. Love how supportive, encouraging and awesome you were through the whole birthing process. Congrats on your future 2nd child.
I KNOW IM ONLY JUST WATCHING THIS VIDEO RIGHT NOW, BUT MATT IS LITERALLY WHAT EVERY BOYFRIEND AND HUSBAND SHOULD BE LIKE!! ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTIVE AND AN ABSOLUTE PERFECT ANGEL. THIS IS MAKING BE AGGRESSIVELY HAPPY
Omg 3:27 why are you so cute abby??
Congratulations u guys
I couldn’t hear anything what doctors are saying. Apart from being supportive he should have let doctors do their job.
What a wonderful miracle of life!  There is nothing quite like seeing a birth!  Well Done Abby & Matt.  Matt you were such a great encourager!  Keep it up!  He is beautiful and he is blessed to have you two as parents!  God bless you all! Thank you for sharing your story in such a wonderful way! Blessings!
The fast-mo before Abby got the epidural looked sus af 💀
The fact that they would even think to do a epi before a ceaser is disgusting
Matt and Abby 😍❤️
This whole process gave me chills
Ok you guys are way too fckng cute 😂❤
Is it wierd that ME & GRIFFIN are 5 days apart?   Like=No Comment=Yes
Ugh I am so jealous on how supportive he is. Not every woman Can get that but witnessing that men like this are out there gives a lot of hope to other women. You guys are one of my favorite  YOUTUBE couple 💗🌈
Aww this is so beautiful! I’m late but thanks guys for sharing with us! And congratulations 🎊 ❤  I was thinking while Matt is telling you you’re so strong, Im thinking so is he…he’s the first dad I saw that didn’t pass out! Lol
Hi im here from the future you gave birth too griffin and your’e pregnant again :)
I almost cried, this is BEAUTIFUL I am so happy for you
Congratulations Matt and Abby your baby boy is beautiful love you
I'm so happy for u he is so so cute
He is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute 😍 💓 💕 💖 💗 ❤ 😍 💓 💕 💖 💗 ❤ 😍 💓 💕 💖 💗 ❤ if I had to rate it it would be 1000000000000000000000000000
I’m watching this back and I’m crying because I feel like I was there 😭😭❤️
Matt was so sweet but I would not have dealt with the affection very well lol! When I was in labor I wanted no one to talk to me 😂
Your so strong we love you ❤
I love the way you guys love each other❤
Matt was giving Abby millions of pep talks
Cried the whole way through.  Abby- you ARE so strong!  Matt- you were so awesome - such a great parter. You two are just fabulous❤️
Honestly watching this at this point in my life hits differently. My wife is 7 months pregnant right now and we are doing our best to prepare for labor and delivery and seeing how supportive Matt was with affirmations and seeing the baby just made me weep. I'm so excited to meet our baby boy too, and we hope that all the struggles during pregnancy will be worth it!
So beautiful, thank you for sharing. You are an amazing power couple and family ❤
Cudowni ❤
Ugh getting induced makes labor soooo much worse
Just so you know it is completely normal to shake during birth ❤
Congratulations 🎉❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am from India i don't know you may read notice my text or not but u guys are really a supercool inspirational couplee i have ever seen i m in love with you from the couple of days i find u out in my youtube i jusst have finished liking all your video please reply if u recieved these text lotsssss lotss of live to u and ur sweet children ❤love you ❤️🧿🧿❤️❤️🧿🧿❤️😚😚😚😚😚😚😚❤️❤️
Holy crap that gave me all the feels about my births and now I want another one lol
My bf was talking just like that in my ear when i had our first baby and it was so annoying to me 😂 His mom was in the background saying things too. I just wanted quietness though. My mom was quiet as can be. I think she just knew me better lol. I’m a very chill and quiet person & my love and his family are pretty loud all of the time. The next couple of times I gave birth, he knew to stay quiet and not talk my ear off. It was so much better lol.
Love you both ❤️🥺🥺 and congratulations 🎉 for new bron baby 🥺❤️❤️😘😘😘so cute
Soo cute one..
Anybody counted how many times he said you’re so strong 😂
You're so strong Abby !!!
ha ha abby saying "its cause im cold, its just a thing"
Love you guys!...but Matt would have drove me crazy with all his supportive chatting while pushing😂 I would have ended up punching him!😅
Awww. Congrats! Thank you for taking us along. Blessings ❤️
I’m not going to lie this is one of my favorite videos! Griffin is SO cute! (Sorry if that is not how you spell his name)
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😤
HES SO CUTE
Congratulations Abby 🎉🎉🎉🎉
me watching her contractions and preparing to push: no way dude i never wanna do that  during her pushing: yeah for sure never happening  when the baby cries for the first time and hearing her say ‘we love you sm, i’m your mom’: ~crying~ okay yeah i’m ready 🥹  congrats, he’s gorgeous 🥰
Now I’m high in drugs 😂
I made it to 6 centimeters till I got epidural and it was the worst pain of my life but then I got a c section my second child and that pain topped all for sure they wouldn't give me anything for pain prior because it was an emergency c-section and I took epidural 12 hours prior it was wearing off so I felt everything they did and I was screaming in so much pain while they were cutting me open tugging cause they had to move some of my parts and put it outside my belly so the baby could come out and I kept getting yelled at by the nurses saying if I didn't stop screaming I would be put to sleep and after the c section I was In even more pain coughing moving anything felt like my stomach would rip open again I couldn't move for weeks horrible.
Awe!! He's so stinking cute and he knows it!!
I think this is one of the best things I've watched on youtube in my entire life ❤
Congratulations 🎊
Babies with lil chunky cheeks are the best and so loveable so happy for u ❤
Holy shit that's cringe
Yes congratulations sorry this is really late I watch this one before just forgot to comment on it
am i the only one that got triggered with all of matt's talking and felt like punching him lmao
Congrats❤ also matt slayed that dance🤣
I hope my husband is as gentile and kind as Matt is
Isn't this the couple that just dragged on Connor and Liana for their baby's name? Classy.
You are the most boring couple in the world
And the doctor reckons he won’t fit through the birth canal like women’s bodies aren’t designed to stretch and give birth. How much did he weigh anyway ? ?
Typical American birth vlog. Get induced, get an epidural, push on your back with your knees out wide (the worst and hardest position to be in to give birth) cut the cord straight away, put eye goop in, put a hat straight on baby it’s all just wrong 😢 so sad this in the norm these days
I love you guys so much
When that morphine kicked in, all I wanted was pancakes too:)
Congratulations 😃
Two things one you are the definition of wonder woman you are Soo strong two when the baby starts coming one of the nurses were kind of rude
who else is watching this when abby is pregnant with baby #2?!! ❤❤❤
Abby is so strong
aweeeeeeeeee!
It’s so so so wild to watch a new life enter the world, nice job Abby, congrats on baby number two as well!
Abby, you are so strong.
i am not crying you are
I cried through out the video...lots of love to Abby... Matt is such a supportive and brave husband!
Omg i just got tears in my eyes!!! Good Luck for the munchkin on the way
I can't stop laughing at Matt's thing he is saying. Your so strong Abby
And how Matt was literally so supportive
Congratulations he's so cute
Before watching your channel I told myself I don’t think I want any kids.. but after seeing how amazing you both are together and how perfect your family is it makes me think I have a chance one day ❤️ hopefully I find someone who is amazing to me just like Matt is to you.
Matt truly is so supportive.. you both are so lucky to have each other in this life ❤️ this video has me in so much tears
Congrats💐💐💐😍😍 A little prince has come into your life as a valuable gift..... Be happy and well everyone.
I just noticed me and Abby are wearing the same nail polish color
❤❤❤
Congrats guys ❤️ stay blessed ❤️
Superb mam and sir every women's want to be like ur husband hates off u sir
Congratulations to your Beautiful family. ❤️😇
Watch your video randomly  And think how cute you guys look together  And this video  My birthday is also 3 July ❤🎉
Gosh that's a really stressful time
I’m kinda new to your channel and I cried at the end. How amazing you both are.
This is so beautiful ❤ loved the support by husband. Here in India(or at least where I delivered) no one is allowed inside a labour room. In case of too much pain, at the max another lady of our choice is allowed for couole of minutes. And that's it.. whole time you will be with some strange nurses who you have never met before. The regular nurses are different and nurses in labour room are different. So you have never interacted with them before the day of delivery !  Not even doctor comes unless it is time to actually deliver. Imagine that. We women, go through everything alone.  I guess in other countries father is allowed for entire process, and really you guys are blessed. 😊
So amazing! Congratulations guys! Also I remember being In labour with my second daughter, and my husband was so supportive...telling me I was doing a good job! Then how I got this!! And how amazing I was.........he was so freaking ANNOYING! I actually told him F*CK OFF!!!!!! I hate all that pep talk! Just tell me you love me! Not good job!!!! You'll know the next time matt 😄 🤣 😂
If my husband talked that much during our births I would have slapped him silly.
Hearing Matt say what he was saying made me legit cry when I came back to watch this the second time
i am watching this at 04:00 and i am loving it
I had four of my babies within two hours of going into labour and with my last baby I was induced and I was in labour for 14 hours! I would advise anyone where possible not to be induced. My epidural only worked down one side as well 🤦🏻‍♀️. P.s my cravings with all of them were bricks and sand 😂
Pretty late (here after Griffin was born and 2nd child is coming in a while) but honestly still, congrats <3 The way Matt was constantly encouraging and supporting Abby during the process of pushing is just so wholesome and Abby is so lucky to have someone like Matt in her life xx
Why was I crieing 😭😭😭😭😭🥺 Congratulations I’m so happy for you and he are so beautiful so sweet🎉
I’m drowning in my own tears. Thank you so much for sharing this moment! My favorite part was how Abby was showering little baby with love holding baby for the first time. Sending love to you guys!!!
Matt is so comforting he’s the best husband EVER
At this point it’s aaa part two  you got the snapper lol
Omggg a birth video tbh never made me cry.. but this was the first time I cried! Matt kept encouraging Abby and that was soo motivating and soo wholesome Love youu guys !! Loads of love from India!❤️❤️
Even though I came 7months later,, I'm not late Matt such a  supportive husband ana Abby the strongest ana courageous queen I know
Who's here after the second announcement!
Eu fiquei apaixonada pela forma com que Matt deu apoio a Abby ❤ que todos os homens possam ser assim com suas esposas em um momento tão único ❤
She’s so strong man
I went 18 hours unmedicated until they told me I had no choice cause I couldn’t stay awake long enough to labor so I had to have a c-section. I was back laboring and my hips are were too close together for the baby to do anything. I wish I knew that 5 hours in. I would’ve taken the epidural then and there and had a c-section instead of fighting it for so long
Awww I'm crying! What a great way to bring life into this world, with all that love. It was beautiful!
I don't think I would want that midwife She sounds panicked, she would make a poor mother more panicked
The nurse yelling would have stressed me tf out lol
Why couldn't we all have a matt 🤗he's amazing
Women are literally superheroes. Congrats guys. I know he's like 7/8 months now, but still.
"My breath smells so bad" "I have to smell that all the time" I'm SCREAMING 😂🤣
The husband is so sweet and encouraging but...after educating myself and having an unmedicated birth after previously experiencing all the interventions with my first child..this just seems bizarre that women are induced when they are not ready and put in the worse positions. Just makes me sad and I m not talking about the pain meds ..just everything else
Happy zero-ith birthday griffin 😂
Wait is griffins birthday on July third?? That’s my birthdayyyyy🎉
Matt legit sounds like a broken record lol
Thank you Matt & Abby for sharing this with us!! Abby is SO STRONG. I just absolutely love your relationship - how you guys support each other. That hospital room is SO NICE!! 💗❤💖
Congratulations to your beautiful family
Uk im really happy because his birthday come one day from my birthday on 4july. MAY GOD BLESS HIM WITH LONG HEALTHY AND HAPPY LIFE💖💖🥰🥰
Abby said ¨you just changed our world¨😭🥰🥰
She's pregnant again 😳💙💙💙💙💙💙💙✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
The way Matt was just encouraging Abby while she was pushing was so sweet and amazing to watch!!
Mat is so comforting!
They are so funny, when Abby was like, “I just wanna watch breaking bad, and eat……….. pancakes.” I was laughing so hard
Who is here when Abby just announced here 2nd pregnancy
Congratulations 🎊 👏
The “i love you” part matt said was the emotional part
“father, son and the holy ghost”
hey it morgan sapp👍
this was really 7 months ago? july, wow. i honestly cant believe this. i’ve been watching your channel before you guys got pregnant and i loved it. (still do) i just came back to the new podcast saying your pregnant and stuff. wow, i’m very excited!!!!!!
“You got this! You got this! You’re doing great! It’s almost done.” It’s so awesomely sweet how he’s supporting and encouraging her. But it’s also hilarious how it sounds like he’s coaching a boxer in the corner right before the last round. 😂  Update after watching the full video: OMG now I’m crying my eyeballs out. You definitely got one of the good ones Abby!
Why is none talking about how supportive Matt was. The funniest part was when the nurse were yelling at Matt to move and Matt is just like your doing so good
i’m crying
My moms birthday is on the July 3
Who’s watching this after they announced baby number 2 is coming
Watching these videos makes me so emotional. I'm 6 months pregnant with my son and I just can't wait to have him. Ur husband is so supportive that's amazing. Such a sweet little boy❤️❤️
My birthday is July 2nd and a have a twin
Congratulations beautiful
at the start of the video when she is out of the bath matt kept looking down like what was he looking at
Yaay
Matt and Abby are the cutest couple and the best parents
Matt is so kind cheering Abby on 😢😊
“I’m high” -abby
That baby is so adorable 🥰. He looks so content and happy!
abby god job  so cut
Baby girl
welcome to the world baby boy
🥹🥹🤣🥲😂 you are brav🍼🥛🏥🏥
Having the epidural is like Christmas Day for a 5 year old 😅 I loved it so much
I've had four babies in less then four years and my Midwife never sounded that terrified.. That Midwife was freaking out. 😰  So glad everything went ok and mama and baby are safe! Congrats💗
Wow. You gave birth. Just like billions and billions of other women. How unique and innovative…Congrats, I guess? I’m just glad their content will go back to anything other than the cringes of baking of child.  Lmao, they acted like they were the first humans in the world to do it 🤦🏻‍♀️
So cool! My wife and I are new to YouTube and are pushing out some content!
I love your videos😊😊Congrats you guys❤❤
I ❤you my name is Morgan 😊
Aww love him congratulations
Matt is such a great husband and so encouraging you got lucky abby😁!!
Matt is so sweet
Honestly I love you guys but if my husband talked that much during my pushing I think I would have yelled at him to shut the f up.
hi Griffin
I LOVE THIS HUSBAND SLAYY MATT
My first son I was induced and had my waters broken and lasted about 4 hours up to about a 3-4cm and had an epidural but with my second I started leaking my waters and the leaked for 30+ hours so was at risk for infection so had to stay in the hospital I started having contractions at 4.30am and by 7.30am he was here I had no time for epidural only gas and air
Poor husband is very annoying, but I understand him! Beautiful otherwise!
Congrats I can’t wait to see him grow up
Bloody hell, Matt - SHUT UP
This was 6 months ago it's too late to say congratulations now
CONGRATULATIONS MATT AND ABBY!🎉🥳🥳🥳❤
he’s has the same bday as me!
Congratulations your little boy is going to have the best parents ever. You guys are awesome and know you can be the best parents that he can have in his life 🎉❤
Matts such a good supporter
Congratulations .❤️

Wow, both of you did so good!!!!
congrats! what an amazing feeling you must have felt holding and seeing your baby! thank you for sharing this experience ❤️ you will both do amazing!
Birth videos make me cry every time 😭❤❤ so precious.
Push, push, push the dislike button
That's actually really sweet of her to hold off on the epidural for another pregnant women to get the C-section. I'm impressed 👍
I can’t believe it he’s six months old and getting very big and Abby Matt is right you are so strong brave and awesome believe me  I’m sorry what you had to go through that but it’s worth it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm gonna cry 😭😢😢😢😢
Congratulations 🎊🎉🎈 ❤️
This is literally the most emotional and awesome thing I have ever seen! The support from mat and the strength of Abby made this 43 year old man cry! I don't have kids of my own but you both did so great and thanks for sharing this so amazingly
I bet the nurses were annoyed by him I would be  you can hear the tone of the nurses
I get the support from her husband but he should learn to shut up more
Abby you are so strong I can’t believe you went through all of that pushing I’m so scared to do that when I’m older 😢
hi im so happy for yall
6 months on and this still brings me so much joy ❤️  You guys are amazing parents, people and such caring humans. ❤️

Great job abby
adorable
Get well soon Abby and Matt
Matt’s mom, your son, and my daughter all have the same birthday!
Yes we’re birthday buddies 🎉❤😂😂😂 congratulations
Omgg😊🥺 Beautiful
He has the same birthday as me 🥺 I was born July 3rd 2005
Pitocin contractions are way stronger and more painful than natural contractions so it’s not surprising that you were done at 4 cm. So interesting how induction affects the body!
“It’s your body, do what ever feels right for you.” 🥹  “Abby said the c-section could go first.”   Paraphrasing, but you two are the best 🥰
Griffin is birthday twins with my brother. He is so cute. Congratulations 1,000,000 times ❤
I love your voices so much Ian so happy for you
He is sooooooooo cute 🥰
My birthday is July 3rd ❤️ btw I'm a new subscriber ❤️ he's gorgeous xx
He was so annoying Omg
Simply Beautiful
July 3rd that’s my birthday
why am I crying
I made it to 8.5 cm thinking it was false labor and I should suck it up (first and only child and he was 3 weeks early), barely got the epidural in time!
most people make pregnancy look easy but this is just like what it is irl
Abby this is just amazing and you are so strong. It looks so painful and I hope that it is worth it. You did great and I hope the baby really appreciates you putting in this effort to birth him
Honestly I started crying in happiness for you guys. Love you two 🤍🤍🤍
First of all, Abby you did AMAZING, great job! And Matt great job helping and encouraging Abby. Also when Griffen getting a little brother or sister?
Guess what, the whole world victimed you coming to this world honey ❤️. I wish you all the wonders of this lil world , hope u always smile with your so loving parents, you're muma is the bravest and your dada is the sweetest, you're so lucky we're so lucky ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Matt its so god and Abby its so sover god ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is there a way we can not just like this video but LOVVEEE it! because it's so beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing.
You are so strong x 100 😁
Ok I’m surprised like speechless right now 😮😶
Omg congratulations!!! Ur baby is sooo cute 🥹🥹🥹🥹
I cried watching this
Lol yea it’s quite cool
Matt was so supportive during the birth and Abby you were so brave!! ❤❤
I’m so happy for her
Matt is so cute and supporting I love their relation
this made me happy cry so hard
Matt and Abby your baby boy is so Freaking  cute ❤️
U guysssssssss!! I ligit cryedddd. I watch all ur videos and have watched this video once before, i was pushing with u, it is so humbling to watch new life come into the world, we love u soo much! Keep up the hard work!! ❤
griffin is so cute congrats
Mothers are so amazing, what they go through. Beautiful baby boy 👶
Matt is so supportive but that kinda chanting would piss me off lmao
Did Abby cheer on a team on Netflix
I love how supportive he is 🥰🥰
Y’all have a beautiful family hope y’all have the best memories❤🥰
Awesome insurance!!
I saw Matt said “I’m sorry Abby” when he was holding him. Best father 12:24
A lot of love thank u
Is anyone watching this when griffin is like 4 months old or older!
Matt was comforting abby and can we take a minute to think how strong and dependent abby is and congrats on the healthy baby!!
❤🎉
But your baby is soo beautiful and your so strong I’m not a ahter
My mom  soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo strong
My mom is way stronger than Abby like when she was have a baby my mom was way stronger then Abby like my mom didn’t even cry
July 3rd is my birthday
I can tell that was not easy at all
Such a beautiful moment.  I can’t help thinking about the fact that people actually get billed for this though and that it can stop people even trying to start a family.
The way he was peting her lol but conrgats
Funny story-so the doctors told my parents my brother was a girl before they knew his real gender so my parents bought all the girl stuff like a princess blanket and stuff so they had to bring my brother home in a hot pink shirt wraith princess on it😂
Your really lucky
Like your baby I hope your baby so cute I hope it it can be like you have the same people I love you all so much y'all can stay together cuz I if somebody call you fat don't let them call you fat cuz they stupid dog love birds so love to get it always put a heart everywhere🤰
The fatherly love in matts face, for abby and the baby, is the greatest visual.
I love how Matt was saying "You are so strong Abby!" And "You can do this!" It was so sweet wish you the best of luck ❤
You can save them for another another little boy when the time comes

Abby and her husband deserved  this they  will be such good parents  and take  good care of him congrats
I think that when Griffen turns 1 that u guys should DEF react to this. And just your old q&a videos abt how u thought the birth was gonna go
He’s so cute and handsome I love you guys as married you guys are so cute together
abby is so strong and matt is so so so supportive
I’m not crying you are♥️   This was the cutest thing ever- that’s all I have to say …….

I am a 18 year old guy and I cried a littel
❤🎉😂😊
I pray my husband is this supportive when Im in labor! So supportive! Congrats you guys
FOR THE FACT THAT EVERY SINGLE MOM OUT THERE HAD TO EXPERIENCE THIS SOME WENT TO HAVE SURGERY AND SOME PUSHED IT AND SOME DIED WOMEN ARE SO STRONG THEY SUFFER SO MUCH FROM PERIODS AND LABOR!
Griffin was born the same day as my friend 🤗🫶💖💕💝🥺 we love you griffin
Si
my birthday is july 6 and I am 10
Congratulation baby boy😇🥰😍
جميل
the baby was born on my birthday 😸😊
Abby your so strong!!!  When I went into labor it's when my husband woke me up I already was 10 cm dilated so the baby would come out any second luckily we got there and I had the baby in 1 20 minutes
My baby sister Eden is like almost the same age. She was born on July 17 , 2022
Mat you are so kind
My birthday is July 24
Im gonna show this video to my bf. If he doesn't tell me the things that Matt told you he wont be allowed to enter the room. Omg I started crying...this was such a beautiful moment, thank you for sharing <3
Not sure if you mentioned this another video bc I'm just randomly watching but was there a reason for the induction and did you do any labor/birth prep. Also I'm sure you know this either then or now but the shakes are very common with an epidural. Soo so sweet, congrats! I love when he comes out and you say "I'm your mom".
So why did you chose to get induced? Was he late?
omg congrats guys!
Due on my little sisters birthday and born on mine, congratulations I hope some day I'll get my rainbow baby
i hope it was nor vaccinated
Cute 😊❤
Congratulations!!!! He was born on the same day I was so happy we could share the same b-day
His birthday is 6 days before mine! That's so cool! Love you! 💓
You are so strong Abby and such a great supporter Matt
Disgusting
The way Matt is with Abby is so sweet and amazing. I gotta be honest tho, I’m pregnant right now with my first and I already know that if my husband even breathes in my direction while I’m pushing, I’ll rip his face off 😂😂
Matt such a brave and supportive dad. Well done !
Hi baby I like❤ you
This was wow just wow. I cried at the end fyi. Abby you are amazing! ❤
I love how Matt was comforting her all the way through and that's a good husband right there Abby good job it was all worth it just pray every night and he will be the best thing that has ever happened to you!!
8 years later little griffyn sees this video 🤐
Matt is the closest to a perfect husband that a husband can get. He is so encouraging and sweet🥲
Having my water broke was always one of my biggest fears when I was pregnant. I (stupidly) worried that my baby would be like a fish out of water once the water broke. I had two c-sections, and they didn’t weird me out or scare me like potentially having my water broke did. The pregnant mind and all the worry is crazy and so different for everybody!
I am so happy 🎉
does eveyone agree that matt is a amazing husband to abby? yes or no
You did so good and Griffin is so cute
Congrats on the birth of your son and he was born on the same day as my birthday
thought he was joking about the short
That was so cute by the end I was crying!
I love you so much you’re the best mother ever I love you you’re just the third of my whole world and I’ll baby in my whole world you’ll old is my whole world I love you so much and I can’t believe you just said that kid in three pushes one more good push and then you’ll get it I love you
Good job Abby keep pushing I know you can do this I want to see your baby but I seen your baby and all the photos and videos of men love you so much you🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This video made me not want to give birth but it also made me want to give birth
Im also born on july 3!
Abby you are so 💪 strong
U are so strong Abby and Matt is so sweet!!! I hope my man will be like Matt when im in labor 🥰
Y'all are gonna be The best parents Ever
you are so strong Abby
Congrats!!!!!!!!
Why did she get induced, honestly I don't get that ,before you even went into labor. breaking water always just is the trigger to make it move. Second. Csections are always priorities
Amazing
❤️❤️
I have so much respect for you Abby! I have 4, the youngest are twins and my longest labor was 12 hours. Moms who have long labor like your are at a level of strength I can’t fathom! (My oldest is you guys age, twins just started college!) it flies so quick! Enjoy every second!
Amazing love you Soo much guys ..you guys realize me how much pain my mom went through when I was born ..Thank you
New subscribe....first weiw today....... Best uf luck for your life......
That doctor that was birth in the baby was rude
Heart touching
Online now no longer safe for kids any more, now days people sharing how they do poop 💩 in toilet ,  Having baby is great moments for any couple, but it's doesn't mean to share live in social media, day by day we are getting worst
Well done mum  Boys  😀
I get the same shivers I thought it was just me
Congratulations
I cried
😊😊❤❤😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉
That’s called Tourette’s
Can we appreciate how abby being so brave it’s probably the most brave we have ever seen from her and how matt was by her side in the whole and him repeating how strong she was he is one of the best husbands/dads you could ever have and i hope you baby is healthy i just wanted to say abby you did AMAZING YOU WERE SOOO BRAVE AND STRONG THROUGH THE WHOLE THING you are the bravest woman i have ever seen i really hope you and your baby are healthy i live you so much ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Damn who’s cutting onions
The sweetest husband. The support every mama deserves. ❤
Only saw this now... thank you for sharing this 🥺 it made me super emotional. I'm a single mom to be with the baby's dad not wanting to be in the picture. He wanted me to get rid of baby. So for that... I'm emotional because Matt was right there with you. I hope I'll be able to do a good job with birthing my baby like you did. You did great ❤❤🥺
Congratulations ❤️
My reading teachers water broke in the middle of class and she said “Well kids that a science experiment
Hey! My son was born dec 3rd and his shoulder also got stuck. He actually ended up fracturing it. I also had that moment where they pushed my boyfriend out of the way and it was so scary! You did amazing 🥰
I think I'm going to cut Matt's pep talk and set it as my alarm sound bc what is this life
Literally Matt 100 you got this 😊
Aww he's so cute
I love how supportive he is! Gosh this makes me so happy for you guys! Congrats you two!! 🥳🥳  I will say though that nurse in the beginning was so aggressive though😅I was like damn
Abby you are so strong I can’t believe it❤
❤❤ I want to be a Pediatrician when I grow up. I love you guys like this if you ship Mabby  Matt and Abby
Videos Jkjk လိုးတာ
Matt you are seriously the most amazing husband that I have ever seen and an even more amazing dad! Abby, you are so strong and so brave, you didn't have to film anything and yet you did so thank you and keep up the amazing work
Hello from Negaunee Michigan congratulations you are so cute together i know you will make unbelievable parents love watching your videos so real love you both
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
sorry if that was my husband I would have kicked him out. that is so annoying the patronizing 'you are so strong'. grrrr. annoying. just be silent support.
Good luook
Wow, I have to say Abby is one hell of a strong woman to be able to handle Matt screaming over everyone. Dude sounded like a broken record 😂 Way to go, Abby!!! Strong wild woman 💪🏻
July the 6 is my birth day
Cute
What a moment❤️
Everytime I see a woman in labor, it gives me flashbacks when I had it and can feel the pain. I had epidural with my first and none on on my 2nd pregnancy, and I regretted it, lucky for me labor  wasn't a long and I only pushed 5x  and my daughter came out.
Abby me and the baby are b day buddy's mines July 17
Getting the shakes or “jitters,” is a side effect of the epidural.
I had the shakes soooo bad and I was so itchy!
I shake always too❤
I think ANY LADIES who are single would LOVE to have A MAN LIKE MATT!!
man I'm crying!
i cried, i am so happyyyy for you. i am sooo glad everything went smooth!
To Matt and Abby I know I am say younger than you but I am so proud of you guys! Thank you so much for sharing this amazing and beautiful experience! Love you guys I've been hear the hole time! Hope you see this!
Welcome to the world little man. You got a lot to learn and a long time to do it❤❤❤
I love how Matt’s giving Abby words of affirmation and everything telling her that she’s so strong and amazing
You are lucky Abby
Your husband is nice
You guys are the best

Women go through this and men still thinks they're better than women..

Matt, what great example of a supportive loving husband. U two rock
your baby was born in my birthday
Give me knucks… really? Shut up and read the room. It’s not about you buddy.
Aww
Omg
At the same time he was born way after and I was probably bad
Guess what he that my birthday July 3 do you every day when it’s when it’s my birthday and his birthday stay strong
I cried 😭 I’m having my first baby in November and I’m so nervous! thankful abby posted this
May God bless you guys🌟. Abby you were so strong he is beautiful ✨💖.
Um his positive words I was like about to burst into tears that encouragement and that support and now this little guy is here omg 🥺 just good feelings all around
This is a sweet man... But damn I would be annoyed if he was my birth partner
omg congrats 💙
My first baby was born 7/17. I’ve been following your whole journey along side you. I doubt you’ll see this but I wanted to let you know since I saw this video before my baby came, when the doctors wanted to give me an emergency c-section bc my baby wasn’t in the right position , I was able to ask if they could flip/spin baby. If I hadn’t seen your video I would have had no clue that was an option during labor. I’m so glad u left that part in your video. I’m certain it saved me from getting an emergency c-section since they were able to successfully spin my baby.
Congratulations 💙👩‍🍼
If my husband isn't like Matt I dont want it 🫴
July 3rd is a common birthday in my family. It’s a great day to be born. Congrats you two! Now on to the hard part of parenting haha
Your baby is so cute. Congratulations. That’s so exciting for you guys.

Congratulations 🎊 🎊
Congratulations, I'm sooo happy for you both☺
I’m expecting my first child in less then 5 weeks and I just bawled my eyes watching this cause literally Matt’s supportive words and calmness was just so wholesome and Abby’s calming voice talking to her baby was just heartwarming! I just can’t even. I’m so excited to have my little girl! Congratulations you guys are going to be great parents! You did great Abby! You are so strong. I personally hate any sort of pain so I hope I can be as strong myself! Bless your hearts and hope your journey as new parents is everything beautiful you’ve ever wanted it to be. 💜💜🥰 so much love!
Congrats you guys wish you the best of luck takeing care of him
Natural birth no medication is awesome the contractions hurt worse than the baby coming out I had my son at 18 and no meds no tears 13 minutes of pushing
Omg! I lost it when Abby said “I’m your mom”. I cried so much 🥺 Giving birth to a little human is so hard on the body but yet so REWARDING. I can’t wait for the day where I create a beautiful family. Abby you’re so strong and you will be an amazing mama. 💗💗💗
Ugh YouTube couples 🤢 I see this channel ending in 6 months to a year. So fake
So I sobbed through this whole thing 👍🏼
Congrats
Por favor hablar en español
Congratulations you two. Also, lmao anyone else find that Matt was kinda cringe and talking too much at the start 😂😂
Matt like ur are so strong he said that shit like so many times like stfu bro ur not helping at all🤦🏽‍♂️
Congratulations you guys that was touching i hope i can be a mom one day inchallah.. That's amazing to watch ❤️❤️
I love the way Matt is so supportive and encouraging and Abby is so sweet but while I was watching this I was thinking back how it was when I was giving birth I did not like my husband to say anything so I could focus and concentrate. When Matt  kept saying  “your so strong” I was cringing 😬Am I the only one?
Anyone else notice they haven’t posted ever since They hade.  The baby
Abby was so optimistic at the start 😊 even though she was abt to give birth!
this video makes me so sad.. they told you when to push, how to push, in which position.. everything is so messed up.. women should be able to move when giving birth!
Good job Abby 😊💗💗💗💗
I am literally crying 😢congratulations 👏
Matt and Abby you’re both AWESOME! 🥲
Abby can you please do a video on your birth process and how you felt and what helped you push the baby. I'm having my baby on September 10 and I'm so worried because I just want to do my best to get the baby out. 👶  any advice??
https://youtu.be/hxUUgk3ZoiM
wish the same 4 me too someday
I am so happy for you
Yall should go to lalo
Oh my the way u support each other. I have my delivery in few days.. i pray god gives us strength to get thru this beautiful process
Congratulations guys❤️
https://youtu.be/apAkU7JBD4E
مبارکتون باشه 😍🥰
If I was the Doctor delivering that baby I’d be so annoyed that someone was shouting “you are so strong” a million times out loud while I was trying to deliver the baby. I’d be like “you are so distracting” … and ask him to step aside.
Matt, would you describe your wife as "strong"?
Hey! On your Recent Shorts of the baby Didnt slept for a minute.. I came to give you a trick to use the White Noise ( a hair dryer sound) it puts him in sleep.. And if the Baby is awake and doesn't let you sleep you can still put it on..
I love how sweet Matt is but I'd be like SHUT UP
congratulations such a blessing your baby is born the same date as me
Awwwww congratulations 💞💞
Love you from INDIA,♥️♥️♥️
Cool couple, congratulations but why does this guy have his shirt off in every video.
This is so amazing to watch thank you for sharing this with us 🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️ and congratulations Mom and Dad!!!!
I cried ❤
Congratulations 😍😍😍😍
I cried watching this. 🥺 Congratulations you two ♥️✨
Congratulations I’m so proud of u guys but “I’m glad the comments aren’t talking about 10:25”
My epidural didn’t work at all (I kicked my doula in the face on accident bc I had complete feeling) and pushed for 4 hrs. I ended up with a c section after laboring 39 hours but it was the worst pain of my entire life. Especially bc it lasted so long. Contractions are horrible!!
With my first baby I didn't know you could ASK for the epidural so I didn't get it till I was at a 7. Congrats to you both. ❤️
Omg congratulations!!! 😍
I know it's a serious thing, but hearing Abby "ssshhhhhhh" ing so much sounded a bit funny, like imitating an air compressor
God Bless You guys and your new son! What a journey, it's only starting :)
He was just a few minutes ago to tell us about your
We are going to be in a few more minutes after we get
Congratulations you two! Thank you for sharing this beautiful part of your life with us.

Congratulations! It has been a minute since I have watched you consistently and how I regret not doing so. I miss you guys. I am so glad you are still the same I rememeber you. Never change. Love you guys!
I don't understand why you guys stop posting on YouTube you wanted to be influencers and then as soon as the baby come you don't post nothing 🙄
He is so beautiful 💜
I kid you not, that is the cutest newborn I have ever seen! ❤️❤️
Hey guys! Weird question! What was the little machine you were using with the sticky pads when Abby was having contractions? I'm preparing for labor here in the next couple of weeks and wanted to know what that was amd what it is supposed to do :) Thanks!!
I just realized that @Conner and lianas baby was born in the same day
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BABIES EVERY DAY NOBODY GIVES A 💩💩💩💩💩💩!!!!!
That was amazing that bonding just the whole thing beautiful and amazing!! ❤️❤️
the beginning of this birth story has my jaw on the floor as a doula.
No🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I found myself pushing as I watched 😂😂😂
Thanks
Congratulations both xxxxx
Congratulations 🎊
I had the same problem when I had son, I had a small lip left, they just rolled me over on my side for a few minutes and it worked!!!
I know that ya'll had a choice between oral pills or patoson to get it started. My doctor didn't give me a choice. Went in to get induced at 5:30am, when my doc arrived, about 8-9 o'clock, he gave me the oral pill, which was broke in half and he broke my water at the same time. You usually take the half pills abt every 3 hours. After he did that, he said, "Now you better not keep me here all day". I said, "I'll be in and out of here in no time". Well....the nurse checked me and said that I was only 7 cm, as soon as she walked out of the door, I felt a POP!! I was calling the nurse, my husband(bc he was home with our twins, waiting on his mom to take over.) When I told the nurse, when she finally came, that I was ready. She said," There's no way you can be at 10, I literally just checked and you were 7cm, I said ,"When you stepped out of my door, I felt a pop". She didn't believe me but she checked anyway. The next words out of her mouth was, "don't move, don't push and just wait for the doctor ". Come to find out,  his head was already out,  a nurse was about to deliver my child. She was born at 12:20pm the same day. The last thing I said to my doctor, "I told you that I would be in and out in no time at all". Best pregnancy, best L&D and her first night, she slept ALL NIGHT!!! It felt so good to have a good full night's sleep in 9 months!!!
You guys are the sweetest couple ever and Abby, you have the most supportive encouraging husband helping you get through the one of the most wonderful experiences you both will treasure the rest of lives Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy🍼👶🍼👶
July 3rd is also my bffs Birthday lol
I am so happy for you guys!!! Congratulations!!! God bless you!!!

What an absolutly beautiful story. I literally cried from beginning to end could bearly see the screen cause of my waterworks. I continued to cry for a good 20 mins or more when i finished watching the video. You guys are an ABSOLUTLY ADORABLE couple and you are going to be AMAZING parents. Congratulations. I wish you all the best with your new bundle of joy.
Me literally crying...good job both of you so proud 💕 congrats 😍 he is so cute🥺
Congrats really. What a 🥰 cutie...  My oldest son was also born on July 3rd and he turned 9 this year. I was a teen mom with absolute no idea but now being a mom of 3 kids I know how to get around them.  Parenting is a journey that's fun and upsetting sometimes. Somethings give pleasure but others might defeat you more but in the end all parents need to do is being polite but strict at the same time.  No one can master but we all can go with it positively. I'm sure you're gonna be amazing parents.  It's a little late but you two need this.  Welcome to this journey!
“You are so strong 💪 “
It remember when you guys weren’t even married it all happened so fast  Congrats
I wonder how much more research and time would’ve been spent on childbirth if men had to go through that ordeal? There have to be better, quicker, easier ways to get have a baby than being traumatized like that
Congratulations🎉🧿
Omg no way! I turned 20 the day you guys met your new baba!!! I’m so blessed to share the same birthday congratulations you guys!!!!!!

Your shivers could be stress or anxiety related.  I do the same thing but I ache all over and can get a temp over 104, so be careful and see if it might be related
Iloveyou  Matt and Abby
I didn’t get an epidural with my son I got the meds in the veins to help with the contractions and they worked good for a couple of hours then got another dose then had my son 30 mins! Congratulations guys he’s perfect
I’m currently 36 weeks and it’s been so encouraging getting to follow along with your pregnancy as I’ve experienced my own!
Love you guys and I am so happy for you!!! I hope that you continue to share your experience as new parents, but please carefully consider how much of your child’s life that you decide to share online as he grows up!
Congratulations to you both

Congratulations to you both. You guys will make parents
Congrats Matt and Abby
Abby's obv amazing!!! And Matt's the SWEETEST<3<3<3 AND THE LIL DUDE'S THE CUTESTTTTTTTTTT<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 this was so beautiful!!!
I am so glad I don't have kids
I am 37 weeks +4days. I told my OB doctor said only one patient requested a TENS unit. My mentor a physical therapist pelvic floor therapist said she encourages TENS unit to help with pain. So my OB said OK 👍🏼 to use it. Thanks for sharing your story.
I am crying so hard right now, what a beautiful birth, congratulations!
Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐 🥳
Do yall have certain days you post your longer videos? I've been watching your page waiting for a video! Not sure if yall have a schedule for posting or not though!
I know he's so sweet, but Matt is talking way too much hahaha it would drive me INSANE.
I love how Matt was telling her how strong and brave Abby is😁😁😁😁  My boyfriend was just holding my hand and heavily breathing
Congratulations on baby
素敵……😭🤍✨ これからの3人に幸あれ……꒰ঌ♡໒꒱
Congrats! Matt sure talked alot. I would have been like, shut up! lol It was quiet when I had my son. Talking agitated me. But he was great. Abby too. Now the hard part begins...
Congratulations guys... It made me cry 😭
Please consider Griffin’s privacy as  he grows up. He did not choose the life of being filmed. No one knows the ramifications of family vloggers yet. I know he’s just a baby now but please PLEASE  keep him out of the spotlight through his childhood. It is unfair that these children cannot consent to something they don’t understand. Child actors have 100x the protections kids on YouTube have. Please like so they see this.
Congratulations guys 🥳🎂
I’m soooooo happy for u guys 😢🎉
Sorry for being late but congratulations
Q
Congratulations he is adorable
Matt accidentally grabbing prune juice 😂
Congrats Griffen is so cute 🥰
from 8 days from the future from this video i am waiing for another video
😍
I’m due in a few months and I’m making myself watch these videos to psych myself up for childbirth… it is terrifying to me
Strong Abby
Where do you work out
Congrats!!
One of your best and most personal videos to date! Congratulations 🎉
My mom told me, that once the baby is out all the pain is forgotten and just all you can think about is the beautiful baby you gave birth to!
Matt is the best husband ❤🌸
Oh my god congratulations guys 🥺💙
I'm so happy I have seen all your pregnant videos 🥲😭🇩🇰🤰👩‍🍼you so strong 💪  Abby
The shakes from the epidural are real hey!!! I couldn’t even explain it, I wasn’t cold at all I just couldn’t stop shaking, my teeth wouldn’t stop jittering, was awful 😭
I was immediately in tears when I saw him...he's so beautiful🥺❤️❤️ congratulations y'all!!❤️
I just saw how in her latest instagram stories how she is having a hard time and had the postpartum blues. I knew that would happen and brought it up before she gave birth. She was always crying and upset throughout her pregnancy and I knew she would have a hard time afterwards. Hopefully she gets the help she needs so she can enjoy her baby and not have issues for years to come
Omg.....congratulations ❤🥺😭
It’s normal, the epidural causes you to shiver 😌
New follower here. I most say this video makes me feel all sort of emotions. My baby boy is due next week and we are new parents too. Bless you all.❤️
Congratulations guys may god protect him and give him long life 😍🥰❤️💕🥳🇵🇰
I’m happy for you guys!! But it seems like they’re going to transition into a family channel and I hope they’re ethical about it. It’s always dicey when parents show their kids on the screen. Just please don’t become like the Ace Family, Labrant Family, or 8 passengers
Ok but I swear I need someone to be as sweet as Matt every Monday morning when I wake up and realise I have school.
Congratulation you're brave abby❣️❣️❣️❣️

I love how Matt is holding in his excite meant to help comfort Abby
This is so cute! I cried! Congratulations!❤️

Congratulations 🎉 🎉
Congratulations to the both of you. you two are Such wonderful people and  parents 💙💛💚🧡
This was raw and beautiful thank you for sharing💕 My first labor went very similar to this. Abby you are amazing and killed it. I just want you to know that Pitocin makes contractions more painful!! I made it to about 4 cm as well before I got an epidural it was incredibly painful. It’s different when you are able to go into labor naturally. It is still painful and I wanted an epidural with my second but not till later and he came so fast I didn’t get the chance😅
So beautiful! Congratulations 💚💚
Welcome to the world handsome little dude . Congratulations Matt and Abby
So happy for you both
Congratulations!!!! I’m an literally crying right now of excitement and of happiness! You are so strong Abby, and just can’t wait to see you grow to be an amazing mama. You guys are going to be Amazing Parents❤️This baby is so lucky to have you guys!❤️😊😆🙏🏽
I'm crying!  I'm so happy for you guys and this was absolutely beautiful!!🥰🥰
AWWEEEE 🥰🥰🥰 This is giving Me so much Baby fever❣️ SUPER CONGRATULATIONS on Your beautiful new Son!!! You all are so incredibly sweet together🎉🥳
Congrats guys I’m so happy for you I’m new to your channel when I first subscribed and I found that you guys were having a baby I was literally looking every day for the video until I found it.
Congratulations 💗💗
Why did I cry when I watched this
Abby you did amazing congrats on your new little family!
I would’ve told Matt to shut the fuck up LMAOO got on my nerves
I love your dynamic... I gave birth two times, both to boys. So congrats! If I see you and especially Matt... It makes me smile how different every woman in labor is processing the experience. I would've punched my boyfriend in the face if he was supporting me like that. Luckily he knew exactly what I needed, which was a little wet towel on my forhead now and then. And for the rest of delivery to keep quiet and let me be. I really have immense respect for all men/women standing beside there women in labor. You have to see us go through pain and also make sure you do what we need, without us being able to tell you what. I needed my own space as Abby probably needed Matt to cheer her on.  I wouldn't trade it for the world: being able to deliver a human being. I loved everything about it. Enjoy your family Matt & Abby. You both did awesome.
Omg I literally teared up!!! This was so sweet, welcome to this world lil dude 🤍😭
Is the baby’s name Gerald?
Congratulations 🎉
I cannot believe this!! Congratulations to the most beautiful parents in the world 🥺
OMG HE IS THE CUTEST BABY EVER!
I know this is so loving and i only feel this because i am a different kind of person, but i would literaly punch my husband if he were to keep talking me up like that when i am in that much pain😂😂
What is his name
Bro I’m an idiot I searched up Sam and Jess instead of y’all and I was confused I was like I thought she was pregnant but then I realized I was just being an idiot tbh
He’s so cute and alert 🥰 congratulations to you all. You did amazing
I will never get to experience that beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing your most special, intimate day! I'm bawling! So many happy tears for your little family. Sending prayers and hugs. Abby, like Matt said, you were brave and strong! Matt, you were a great cheerleader! <3 <3 <3 <3
Congratulations! 💕
He is just beautiful 😍💓congrats I hope he is healthy
Well done dad you did a great job!
Try a home birth I think it's easier!
Now that's what I call fucking supportive. Found this video by sheer luck. Congrats to you guys.

Thumbs up for not fainting when you looked down Matt😅. That’s a serious problem with many fathers.  Oh and congratulations 🎉
Congratulations! I was induced with my 1st child, my son, on July 2nd and delivered him on July 3rd.  It's so true how the song says "don't blink"  cuz it feels like I just had him yesterday but he actually just turned 21. Savor every moment  with your new son cuz time truly does fly by at warp speed once you have a child.
Congratulations
Abby you are so strong lol great support team congratulations you two 💕

Congrats you guys 💋
Congratulations from Malaysia for dear Abby & Matt.  Griffin is so beautiful.   It's lovely of you & really love your concerns showed when you covered certain situations.
So proud! Love you guys! Congrats 💙
Poor thing! She was in labour for over 24 hours.... Some women are lucky and they have their baby in 2 to 3 hours. Matt was so supportive!
Congrats to you
Congratulations to you both! So happy for you guys!
The three things they did that I definitely want to do when I have my first kid. 1. Constant positive affirmations from the father during the hard times to help with the pain, 2. Comfort from the father like him holding my hand, stroking my hair, massaging my back, all aspects to help with pain and anxiety. 3. Music during sleep or even pushing to help calm me or to help me get through a long time of pushing or period of pain. I liked all the stuff you guys did and you clearly are a very strong couple I hope one day my boyfriend and I can achieve something as strong as you two clearly have. I wish you guys a happy life with your new family :)
I lost it when she said “it’s so crazy in this world huh” that was his very first moment in the world and I just 😭😭  the sweetest video thank you guys for sharing. You treat each other with such kindness and gentleness it’s beyond inspiring.
Congratulations love you guys
I think I would punch Matt for saying so many times "good job honey", "you are so strong" 😅 Happy for you guys, God bless you 🙏
Congratulations!
Matt and Abby will be a great mom and dad
Your baby is a cancer like me 😻😺😸
I love how Matt is like I love you you are so strong
Rich ti

Congratulations!!!!!!
You killed it Abby, way to go girl!! And you seemed like a wonderful support, Matt, way to be there for your lady!! Congratulations and welcome to this world, sweet baby boy!! You're already so cared for:)

I literally despise these token YouTube couples, but god damn you two are just so delightful and sweet and kind and thoughtful. Congrats on your beautiful baby boy 😘😘😘
he was born a hour and 2 minutes before i was... The fact women do this every day is amazing abby is so strong and that baby boy is so lucky to have you guys. These kinds of videos make me realize what my own mother went there and makes me crazy thankful for and her im increadably thankful for all the other women in my life. Sorry for the bad spelling :)
So precious! And you all were too sweet!!! You had such a supportive man by you!! I just cried watching! Wishing I could do it all again!
Omg happy birthday little guy he has the same birthday as me
Enjoy now daddy, that's gonna be a MaMa's boy.
My wife and I also welcomed our baby girl on July 11th (Free Slurpee for life?) and she is the first grandchild on both side so she will be spoiled! Parenthood definitely make us sleep deprived, but so worth it and rewarding. Let’s take on parenthood together. Best of luck!
I'm not crying, you are
I’m so happy for you guys!! He was brown on the day before my birthday that’s so cool!! You guys are such amazing parents!
I really want to see this baby grow up
You guys are so strong Especially Abby she did get i started to cry when Matt was like your so strong
This is so wholesome, congrats! It always amazes me what women can do.

I'm sure Abby wanted Matt to be cheering her on but it's funny to me bc I'm the complete opposite... if that were my husband, I would've told him to shut up, be quiet and just hold my hand LOL If I'm in pain, I want silence and peace 🧘🏻‍♀️
If I could count how many you are so strong’s they would probably be like 1000

Congrats on your first baby! I will be due in December with my 2nd. Goodness, you had quite a wait for your moment at the hospital. With my first son I did my contractions counting in the comfort of my bed at home and went straight to the hospital ready to give birth. The nurses were in shock. I had my baby in 14 mins labor time. Hope my 2nd will be just as smooth and quick tbh. Congrats again and God Bless to you and your new little family.

В шоке с системой деторождения в Америке 🙈 столько лишних процедур, которых можно избежать.  Но ребят поздравляю! Слава богу, все прошло хорошо ♥️
Congratulations!! I cried in happiness for you!
I’ve never cried more in my life
Congratulations ♥️♥️
I know Matt was trying to be supportive. I've had two babies... But I think id be so annoyed by his talking 🤣
I had both of my babies without medication, and let me tell you. The worst pain is during transition when you're literally begging for it to end and saying, "I can't do this! I don't know how much more i can take."  It's rough, but God is so kind to us and let's us forget about the pain almost immediately after giving birth.
OMG CONNER AND LIANA ARE IN THIS
The fact your husband is so complementary it melts my heart you are so lucky to have him and you are amazing and strong so keep fighting and don’t give up
You're a strong woman ❤️
Dude I was not even expecting to cry but like here I am
Congratulations, he is so sweet💙🥺

Awwwww bless you had to go through birth for so many hours. My first baby was delivered at 38.2 weeks, and since my waters broke it took only 5 hours to hug our little baby boy. I took epidural also, because the pain was to much, but I took it too late because I was already 10cm dilated and it was time to push, so didn’t help much but when I hugged my little angel I forgot about the pain 😊 the best moment in mums life 🥰 hugs to you and keep strong for first couple of months xx it is so worth it ☺️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats he is so adorable

I'm about to have my first baby in October. We are having a girl which I'm so excited for. The minute I saw you holding your baby for the first time I started bawling. I can't imagine the amount of joy you felt finally getting to hold your little one in your arms. That's the one thing I've been looking forward to is seeing her and holding her. The amount of love you both have for each other and that baby shines right through the screen. I cannot tell you how happy I am for you both! Congratulations!!!!

When constant bad breath doesn‘t keep you from getting pregnant, it either can‘t be that bad or you guys simply don‘t do missionary.
I know Matt was excited but if that was my husband I would tell him to shut the f up hahahaha Beautiful video💗
Congratulations you guys..😘
Congratulations from India 👏🎉👏🎉🎉
Wow you had a baby...like 8 billion people havent already.
Matt was Uber as a coach but after my 2 births I would have had to have had his lips sewn closed or banned from the room.
Ooooo man little hero welcome to this beautiful world with your amazing parents love from India i m 18 not have that much adult feeling but i know the love 😘😘😘😘😘😘
I’m so happy for y’all! Congrats👶🏼💙
Abby is constantly saying how bad Matt smells after working out. Now the bad breath and she said, “I have to smell that all the time.” I’m thinking halitosis and you can fix that. Get to the dentist and tell them you have a bad taste, smell even after you floss and brush. (Edit: dental hygienist)
Thank you for sharing he’s beautiful blessings in abundance ❤️
IM CRYING HES SO PRECIOUS 😭❤️ congratulations guys!!!! i love yall so much God bless!!!💗💗💗
Happy birthday to baby & Abby too (Mama’s should always be celebrated on a child’s birthday also!) BTW, the epidural typically doesn’t have any narcotics in it. The reasons for her feeling of elation & euphoria were a result of having the pain of the contractions gone. Your brain reacts in this fashion when suddenly relieved of great bodily pain.
Congratulations guys❤️
Omg I love you so mush he is so cute!!!!!
Im cryyyyinngg!!  congratulations!!
Congratulations ❗
love how much u guys have pregressed over the last couple of years , been watchin' y'all for a really long time now , y'all are the kindest souls ive ever seen , god bless y'all and the lil dude , we love you so much 🥺💫

as a woman, i’m so scared to give birth. like, isn’t it painful? having to carry a human in for 9 months and surely the father’s heart will be beating fast but definitely not faster than the mother. i would love to have kids of my own but it seems really scary and painful and things can go wrong i’m so many ways.

Well… Congratulations! You have a beautiful baby boy!
Congratulations to you both. I am 36 years old and I love watching how sweet you both are with one another and I have to say that I've actually used your relationship as an example of what my girls should strive for when it comes to their life partner showing them videos of how Matt treats Abby and I've used Matt as an example of how my son should treat their wives and  it warms me to see how amazingly happy you both make each other and with the newest member of your little family all I can say is once you are a parent you experience a new kind of love you never knew existed and I'm sure you both will be amazing parents. I wish nothing but happiness and success in all areas of your lives. Congrats once again.

Man I never cry at videos.. but I have been watching you guys for so long, and this felt so personal to me simply due to the amount of love I have for you both. I started shaking crying out of happiness and joy. You guys feel like family, yet we’ve never talked, and you guys have no clue who I am. I can’t believe this finally happened.. it feels like yesterday you guys posted the video announcing Abby’s pregnancy.. oh my gosh.. I’m currently in shock and disbelief still. I guess all I can really manage to say at the moment is congratulations! I mean not the stereotypical congratulations.. but the congrats to everything you two will do and overcome.. and have done, and have overcome.. he is so handsome and I already know he has the most amazing parents. And remember, there is no such thing as perfect, so don’t beat yourselves up trying to be, because you guys will be absolutely amazing, and he will grow up loved, cherished, and happy. You’re both going to be the best, most lovely parents. So again, congratulations, in every wonderful way possible. I love you all (lil dude obviouslyyyy included) so so so much. You’re all a bunch of blessing. And he truly is a blessing, and an Angel. I’ll stop being sappy now, but I am so proud of you both! And Abby.. you did absolutely amazing. Matt’s absolutely correct. You are so strong, so beautiful, so resilient, loving, caring, and kind. Not only are you two blessed, but so is the handsome baby boy, he is blessed to have you two as his parents.. I hope all is well and that you guys are having the best moments/memories  of your lives right now!! With much love, Emma❤️
Congratulations!!! ❤️

First off, congrats on your baby boy!! My little love is gonna be 6 mo next week, and having a little boy is the sweetest thing 😍😍 Second, about you putting off your epidural for a c section. Idk if hers was an emergency c section. But I had one, and you're a blessing for letting them go forward with the c section! I was induced because I was a week over. I was in labor for over 12 hours, pushing for 3, and nothing was happening. I was completely exhausted, and so we finally decided to go forward with a c section, which I was so grateful for!!
Abby: how long does it take to flip the baby  Nurse: umm 2 seconds she will do it while you push  Abby: I don’t think that’s gonna feel good
Congrats! Abby your amazing hun! And Matt is the sweetest
Dude I showed up to the labor room 6 inches dilated in pain , almost broke my man's hand including his thumb

Yaaaaaay he’s so cute
its crazy because the stone age didnt have this and they survived lol
If I was one of the doctors I’d punch you if you didn’t stop screaming “you are so strong”
You literally treated her like a kid throughout the whole thing, you should be ashamed of yourself
I am so happy for you guys. My heart is so overjoyed for you. This is the most beautiful gift ever and I wish you all the best! Thank you for sharing this sweet journey. 💙💙💙 I pray that Abby heals up quickly and that baby keeps getting big and strong. Much love.
I had the same situation except no progression or effacement so it was like 2 days of just softening then labor was so fast after the Pitocin kicked in. I passed out after my epidural at 4cm because I’d been in so much pain for those two days and woke up with my baby fully coming out. Only 1 practice push and then immediately after the doctor came in it was 2 pushes and she plopped out.
Congratulations and God bless that beautiful boy!!!
SO CUTE
Omg congrats 👏💖your baby boy is so cute
Congratulations to you both!!!!
first of all, i just want to say congratulations! You guys have done it and i cant wait to see the little baby ❤️❤️ ALSO! when i heard that matt’s mom’s birthday is on July 3rd i started laughing because thats my mom’s birthday as well! What a coincidence! Hope all goes well! Sending love 💕

I'm sobbing like a baby over here! This was BEAUTIFUL! Matt you are SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SUPPORT SYSTEM to Abby! The way you kept encouraging her and cheering her on was such a beautiful thing 😍  I've had two children myself and I must say, to have that kind of love and encouragement during the labor process, may seem like a small gesture to some, but those motivational words make such a difference in making a woman believe in herself and gain the strength and confidence in her ability to get through the most empowering experience a woman will ever go through in a lifetime. Men like Matt are what the world needs more of. You are going to be an INCREDIBLE father & And Abby the most incredible mother!!Congratulations, Mom and Dad!!! You 3 make such a beautiful little family 👪 💕 💙 ❤

Congratulations Abby and Matt!! Thank you for sharing with us. Just thought I'd drop a (different) comment to say you might be overwhelmed with congratulations, differing opinions, and sometimes even toxic positivity over the next several months. I want you to know that it is ALWAYS OKAY to feel NOT OKAY. It's normal to cry and feel like you can't do this. It doesn't mean you love your son any less. Raising a little human while sleep deprived, recovering from birth, trying to figure out nursing/feeding and reorienting your marriage all at the same time is an insane task. If you ever need anyone to talk to as an outlet, hit me up! Love from a fellow young mama to an 8 month old
Congrats can’t wait to watch your family grow
Matt: You are so strong! x 100 Abby: 😬😬😵
Congrats 👏👏 so precious
I want you both to know that you did absolutely amazing! This was so pure and perfect. You showed us the pain of going through this but also how strong we can be. You are such an amazing women Abby, and your baby is perfect. Matt you did so good being their for her through this and comforting her. You guys created a beautiful little baby❤️
I’m so proud of you guys! I hope you enjoy this new chapter in your life!

I love you guys! I'm so happy for you! This brought me to tears, and Matt and Abby, you have such a beautiful baby!!!
Most obnoxious couple on the internet.
Congrats so happy for you guys 😭🎉👶👨‍🍼💙💙💙
Matt can sometimes have an OVER reaction in certain situations, it has a lot to do with his maturity level…Matt has  very good intentions and he has a very good loving heart…However he is lacking self awareness in this particular situation..He is Shouting at Abby as if he is at a PEP Rally…while she is in a tremendous amount of pain…He seriously created a chaotic environment to the point where he is louder then the Drs. AND Nurses that they can’t hear each other they literally have to shove him out of the way and take her leg away from him….He needs to watch how another husband who is older and wiser with more maturity handles himself during that same experience so he can see the difference of how he can be supportive and excited also while remaining calm and keeping the environment and the energy calm as well…He has some maturing to do…..I’m not posting this to be mean just an observation…Wishing Them all the best…
Oh my God he’s so cute❤😂🎉😊
Aww congratulations literally nearly cried,so beautiful x
Congrats, you guys are so cute together ❤️❤️I’ve been watching all your TikTok recently to see if there is a baby yet, and I’m so happy that he is here💙he is so beautiful

I can't wait to see him in videos and congratulations
Congratulations 🥺🥺
Congrats I wonder what his name is!!!!! 🎊🎊🎉🎉💖💖❤❤
First of all I just happened over it across this video and the husband should have not touched her hair or done anything you can clearly tell her the nurses was trying to move him back because the baby got stuck or whatever and they need to do what they needed to do he shouldn't have kept talking and talking and talking to everybody that's going to get the woman anxious and nervous and I should definitely would not want that in my ear the pain is not a joke 🤬🙄
O-M-G I could cry I watched this like ten times BEST BIRTH VID EVERRRRRRR I love y’all sooooo much Matt and Abyy y’all will be the funniest coolest best parents everrrr!!! Wishing y’all the best and many blessings. Have a blessed day!!

Congratulations to both of you!!!!
I guess we don’t get to know the name
Y'all r going to be the best parents
This exact story happened to me. Lip at the fully dilated, baby’s head was apparently not in the right place. They rushed me into a c-section for no medical reason just because they were trying to get the baby out fast to move onto other patients. Pushed for 4.5 hours on my back and wished I had pushed on all fours. Hope you’re recovering okay.
congratulations  abby and matt I prayed for you people to  have healthy baby 🎊🎉
Man I love them so much and when Matt kept comforting her it just took my heart away ♡´･ᴗ･`♡
Congratulations you guys. I can’t wait to hear the name!

💙💙💙💙💙
On my gosh I can’t! We got pregnant around the same time, I followed your journey all the way through. Abby you brought me so much comfort through my pregnancy because I wasn’t loving my ‘ever changing body’ and I also wasn’t expecting to get pregnant when I did and I had the same feelings you shared on YouTube. Our nursery’s have THE SAME ACCENT WALL! like what are the odds of that! And then I also delivered on July 3rd after induction on the 2nd. I feel you on the epidural, 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND. I took a nap after I got mine and it let my body relax how it needed in order to dilate. So happy for you both! You got this mama!
Congratulations!! I shiver/shake like that too from an epidural, after my spinal tap and when things happen. It has something to do with a hormone release I believe but it's crazy having no control over it.
congratulations!!! he’s so cute 😭
I have been following along with y’all’s journey since you found out you were pregnant, and i am so excited for y’all! you guys are going to be the best parents and i pray that everything goes well with taking care of your baby! love you guys 🥰🫶🏻❤️✨

CONGRATULATIONS YOU GORGEOUS FAMILY <3
Congratulation and thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing one of the most emotional and powerful things I have ever seen. I am living a bad period and you guys with your video reminded me that there are such beautiful reason to live and love our life❤️❤️
You know this made me cry tho. The only thing Im scared the most is being a mom. I have mommy issues and I grew up with lots of trauma that I got from my mom. I don't want to get married and I don't want a child. I dont want to treat my future child the way I was being treated by my mom. I know, lots of my friends said like i can be fixed it but you know what if I treat my future child the way my mom did to me when I don't even notice myself that im treating child like that. It scares me all the time whenever I think about my future family. Thats why I don't want to get married and don't want to have a child. Btw, Im so proud you and so proud of all mothers.
You guys will make the best parents ever. Congrats on the lil dude! 🥺❤️
Omg congrats ❤️ 💙 💜 💖 💗
Congratulations!! Abby you did fantastic, giving birth is one of the hardest things women go through. You did amazing! And Matt what a cheerleader!! Loved watching this💙💗 your little man is so very precious!! Get lots of rest,sleep when he does is the best thing to do for your body to heal!! Congratulations to you both!! 🤗💙

Congratulations Matt and Abby Lil dude is so cute😍😍
Such a beautiful baby!  Congrats!  And a quick note to other expecting parents--each couple experiences the moment as is best for them.  I couldn't have had that much loud talking going on, it would have been distracting.  So, if the mom-to-be asks you to be quiet, don't take it personally.  And if  you feel quiet, that's ok, too!
Awww congrats! When Abby said ‘it’s been a crazy day huh?’ My heart melted 🥰❤️
Congratulations!!
I hope i wasnt the only one that cried. Congratulations!!
I am so happy you shared such a precious moment with us. I am in my early 20s and engaged to a beautiful woman and we go back and forth about wanting to give birth or not because of how painful it seems. The teamwork you showed was impeccable. The instant relief and joy I saw Abby had holding that baby made it seem as if the pain was never there. Pain is truly temporary. This video is everything I needed and more. Thank you so much for sharing.
Congratulations 🎊🎊
Congratulations. Thank you for sharing this with us. I know you're a solider because I was dilated 3 cm and it was the worst pain I've ever felt. Shortly after I had a c section because idk if I could have pushed my son out. This made me cry like it was me going through this. So beautiful those first moments  after the baby is born. 💙💙💜
didn’t think this would make me cry as much as it did🥹
This is my 5th time watching it! I am really happy for you two!
Omg the way they all cheered Abby on, that’s so sweet. Congrats, I love you, you’ll be the best parents ever!! ❤️

congratulations abby & matt its so cute 🥰
I’m gonna cry istg
This really is such a great video to show that even a epidural isn’t a free ride. It’s hard work having a baby and when a woman has an epidural it’s just a tools that she uses in labor and none of it is easy. She had one heck of a journey to get him born and an epidural helped, it isn’t a fix all.
🥹 I’m so happy for you guys!! ❤
Congratulations guyss being parents is the best part of life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥😘
I'm not crying, your crying 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 congratulations yall are gonna be the best parents!

July 13th or 3rd July bro?
Congratulations to both of you and thank you for sharing this very intimate and powerful moments! I do have a question, why do they induce the delivery whenever the hospital has a spot and not wait until Abby's body (nature) starts the delivery process? It felt like the whole medical inducing procedure delayed the birth so much because the body was not actually ready. But would love to hear opinions/experiences on that :)
Matt your istarong 💪man 👨congratulations 🥳🤱
He is so cute abby I wish I can be him cause your an a amazing mom and mat is the best husband ever he supported more than the world can
Congratulations mommy and daddy!!!!  He is BEAUTIFUL!!!! ✨💙❤
❤️❤️❤️
So happy for you 🤍🤍🤍
I’m so excited for u both!!! Ur world just grew in the most beautiful and joyous ways possible!!!! U got this! I’m a momma of three who married their high school sweetheart 23 successful years ago! Here goes a new journey!!!
Congratulations 🥳 💕
Congratulations y'all!! Such a handsome lil dude. My birth with my second son Ben his shoulders got stuck too and I couldn't get him out I was pushing with all might. The Dr tried breaking his collarbone to get him out because his heart rate was dropping and also because cord was wrapped around his neck and hims was just too big lol 9lbs8.9. But she ended up breaking his arm 😢 it was terrible. So happy y'all had a happy healthy safe delivery for mom and baby boy 💕 Remember to soak soak soak in the tub and then to also ice yourself too when you can helps so much with pain and stay on top of your Tylenol and Motrin. So happy for y'all 💕
Congratulations!!!!!!!!i'm so happy for you!!! SO EXCITED TO FIND OUT THE BABY NAME!

That just made me cry 😢 so proud of you guys, congratulations ❤️
Congratulations guys
Congratulations
Omg, the moment we have all been waiting for, Congratulations!!!!  Im so so so happy!! Hope lil dude is doing well!!!
Congratulations!!! You guys are going to be amazing parents! May God bless your family! 🙏🏽🙌🏽❤️  Just wanted to give you guys a little info. Abby induced labor is definitely a little stronger then going into labor on your own. I got my epidural at 3 centimeters and felt so weak for not holding off longer. But what was never told to me was the induced labor actually forces your body into labor so the contractions are much stronger. I was induced with my firstborn and I wasn’t with my other 2 kids. My second I didn’t ask for the epidural until I was 8 centimeters. My last baby I did a water birth which was an amazing experience and didn’t get any medicine during labor. You did a great job and the best reward is your son. What a blessing! Much love to your family! 💙
This is private you shouldn't have sjown this!  I can't watch, Congratulations Anyways
Congrats and All the best for you and lil dude ❤❤❤
i just wanna say that this, it's a whole new level of beautiful, this whole process that every mother goes through. i'm still a 16 year old highschooler but watching videos like these makes my respect for all of the mothers out there, grow more and more and it just makes me appreciate the beauty of nature a lot more than i already do. huge props to you for sharing smth so personal and special to you. matt constantly saying words of encouragement here and there was so wholesome to see. i literally teared up when the baby boy finally came out, it was a moment beyond beautiful. and omg he is the cutest thing everrr and i hope for nothing but the best for him as well as the rest of your family. keep safe you guys! xoxo
congratulations

Thank you Abby and Matt for sharing such a wonderful, intimate and lovely moment with us all. Cheers to a job well done Abby and Matt for being such a loving, supportive and caring partner!! I hope this lil dude will grow into a healthy and awesome young man, a person with a kind heart and soul!! Congratulations once again you guys!!

Great job Abby, can I just say that Matt was great to give those inspirational words. And again power women.
Abby was so calm through all of this, you really are so strong, I would’ve wailed and wept I kid you not 😂😂 I commend you for your patience through it all. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I was smiling as well as in tears when you finally had him in your arms....  Congratulations.❤ God bless your little family👪

This was truly beautiful and you are so strong Abby. I’m in nursing school and want to be a labor and delivery nurse, and this video brought me so much joy and tears. It’s truly a beautiful experience and mothers deserve endless credit for what they go through for their babies.
Congratulations Abbey and Matt!  Matt you are so so sweet with your beautiful encouragement the whole time.
I have never cried on a birthing video EVER, but this made me cry my eyes out when Abby said “we love you so much, I am your mom” made me weep, she couldn’t wait to introduce herself ❤❤❤❤ love you guys congrats & May God bless your family.

Congratulations guys you are already the greatest parents to him, it’s strange because my sister has only just had her baby on the 30th of June on my nephews birthday so are double birthdays getting more and more common? 😂 no but in all seriousness well done you’re gonna be great x

Me and your angel shareing the same birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
this was wholesome hats off to Abby for being okay with sharing this and hats off to Matt for being so supportive love lil dude 🥺
Other women make it so much longer without the epidural because Pitocin makes your contractions worse. It’s literally forcing your body into labor.
Congratulations i am so happy for you. 🙂🙂

I think I would have killed my husband right on the spot while i am having contractions if he would say these things over an over to me. I mean Matt is so supportive and tried his best and maybe that was super helpful for Abby but for me personally no. It’s just so exhausting and I am pretty sure like 100% it would annoy me😂

Congrats on your new son!You are all amazing and the baby is so cute 🥰,Love from Italy
Congratulations I am going to cry
Matt points for trying lol but if I was in Abby’s position and in that moment I would have told you to shut up haha😂 Way over the top lol. It would have annoyed me more then being encouragement 😂 it was irritating having you constant scream “you are strong etc etc “ over everyone else talking. But I mean, whatever is Abby’s thing then go for it but I have a feeling she just didn’t want to hurt your feelings by asking you to stop so I give Abby points for putting up with it 😂 Clearly you meant well but yeah wasn’t something most women would find helpful when focusing on pushing out a human haha. Either way congrats on the bubba 🥰 xo
Omg  ... witnessing the whole thing...was a big rollercoaster ride of emotions ❤️... Baby truly changed your whole life to the next level... lots of love for you both and congratulations dear ❤️ we'll support you always and watch you guys grow into the best parents...❤️
Not my favorite maverick city song( Joy of the Lord) playing in the background 🥺❤❤. So happy for you guys!! May God bless you and your little dude🙏🏾❤❤🥳

Congratulations you guys. This brings me back to giving birth to my own child 19 months ago. You have many sleepless nights ahead. You’ll be up every 2-3 hours feeding your newborn.

“you are so strong you are so strong you are so strong you are so brave you are so strong...” 😬💀 Now EYE would’ve honestly likely hated this in the moment bc of how overwhelming and redundant that sounded like I would’ve wanted to scream “shut up!” lmao but one can truly see how loving and supportive you are Matt and if she liked it then that was the perfect approach! You set a great example for how partners should b to women! Congratulations y’all!
Some people start at at 4 cm so that’s probably why they get farther lol. They don’t have to feel it until then.
Congrats!!!! This is qmaiNg!!! Matt is so supportive

Congratulations Matt and Abby!! Wishing you all the best with your son!
The most sweetest birthing video I've ever watched. I love you guys. Never bawled my eyes out so much for a birthing video. Matt you are so precious and supportive. Your gonna be an amazing dad. And Abby, you are the sweetest most amazing mama bear. You guys will do amazing. 💕💕💕
Matt being shirtless is permanent doesnt matter even its in hospital. Anyways, so happy for you guys. The baby is sooo cute Masha Allah.
Omg I am so happy for you guys💙💙
Congratulations!!! You are so strong. Your birth is almost exactly like mine was. My baby was the same, not in the right position. They also had to turn her. I also had an epidural at 4cm. I couldn't dilate. I'm 11 weeks pregnant with my 3de baby. I cried when you little boy came out. He is so precious.
Hearty Congratulations Guys ❤
I love Matt’s support threw that whole time you guys are going to be the most amazing parents that baby is so lucky to have you guys as mom and dad. Congratulations guys 💙💙
He is looking like Abby though 😅
Idk why but i was crying whole video🥺🥺so emotional
i love your Baby❤️
❤😭
Congratulations guys. I am very happy that both mother and son are healthy. And i am still younger than both of you but i hope i one day become unique human being like you guys.   P.S. :- I clicked so fast....The flash would have been jealous
Congratulations guys..❤️❤️
Omg congratulations 😩♥️
Every time an OB makes a mom give birth on their back I want to SCREAM. Oh my gosh there are even positions you can do with an epidural to work with your body and not on your back. Makes me so freaking angry. Abby I'm sorry you thought, because doctors always knows best 🙄, that you had to give birth on your back. Stupid American prenatal care.
Oohhh Enhorabuena familia!! 👼🏼❤️❤️❤️
Awwwwww
Imagine what people do for money
Good jod congrats
Congratulations dudes 💕😍Will be waiting for every moment of the Lil dude..please share it with us too..#excited 🤗😍God bless you and ur child ❤💕

Congratulations guys!! ✨🎉 Beautiful baby boy! 💙 I just wanna say that Matt is amazing cheerleader during the pushing stage, my husband’s reaction for my first child was total shocked and trauma for him  with all the blood lol but with second child he feels like he’s a pro 😂 Getting chills after getting epidural is completely normal. I was shivering the whole time with my 1st child as I got the epidural but the 2nd child I wasn’t able to get epidural because got dilated quickly to 10cm. Rest well Abby and happy for you guys! 🥳
Congratulations to both of you 🎊

Oh my goodness, congratulations you two!!!  I'm currently sitting here WEEPING at how incredible this whole experience was, having already given birth to two of my own, and less than three weeks out from being due with Baby #3 (our second boy)!  And yet you've reminded me of just how magical (despite being extremely painful) this experience can be.  ♥️ You've inspired me to try and film some of this birth this time around, and I can't wait to see more content with you and your little dude!  🥰

Until I meet a man like Matt I’m staying single The way he keeps looking at you no matter what😭🥹 I can’t handle it
Aaaaaahhhhhhhh when I saw the vid I was jumping up and down. Congratulations Matt and Abby. Hello lil’ Dude welcome to the world
Congratulations! I just think it was very rude for another you tube couple who are  suppose to be friends posted a pic on their Instagram before you guys got to post your  video. This was your time to be in the spotlight and it was stolen from you by her doing that.
Congrats to your new family of 3! he's gorgeous! so so happy for u guys! I had to chuckle when Abby asked how they do it without an epidural and i can tell you firsthand from 4 self experiences,,,,,,,,you scream bloody murder and attempt to bend the metal bed rails into pretzels! true story. you were a rockstar.
As women we go through so dang much. Birthing humans is a superpower....trust me I've done it 3 times already and will my 4th and LAST time in November. Men will NEVER quite understand how painful and uncomfortable pregnancy is and then the pain of labor and delivery.  Matt is a wonderful man cause he has done all he can to help and support Abby and their baby.
So exciting!
Matt was so supported made me teary🥹😭
Congratulations!!!♥️♥️
Best birth vlog ever 🤣 love the dancing

I shake when my body is decompressing through stuff too, it mostly happens after I have a ptsd episode and when my nerves start to calm I shake too. I think it’s our body’s way of decompressing or coming back to normalcy. Also lol my son was born at 7:44pm. Congratulations you guys are going to be the best and most understanding parents. Don’t get me wrong lol it will be hard sometimes but you guys are such beautiful souls and are going to raise a great man!!
Congratulations you guys!!!! I’m so happy that you baby is here. He is so so lucky to have amazing people as his parents. Love you guys so much. If you need a break from yt for a little while to get settled in with you baby, please do so. We don’t want to make you feel like you have to post. Love you guys and again congratulations on you new baby boy.

Abby you are so beautiful! Congratulations to you and Matt on the birth of your precious son. He is so handsome!
Yaya 😭😭
My gosh Matt if that was me I would be telling you to calm yourself down or shut up. That is way over drama to be acting like that. There’s one thing to be helping coach her through it and there’s another way over the top like you. That was insane and I’m sure it was getting on the nurses and doctors nerves
I am so so so happy for you guys! Congratulations!! 🥰
Congratulationsss Matt and Abby!❤

When I got the epidural I think I was like 7 cm along because the nurses kept asking me if I want the epidural I was trying to keep going without it and I finally gave in I didn't feel anything when I pushed our son
It’s beautiful 😇♥️ Congratulations you two ♥️♥️♥️
I know i’m late but i’m so happy for y’all congratulations!!!! He’s so cute and precious. Y’all are gonna be great parents, i wish y’all the best of luck! 💗❤️🎉
Oh man. As I sit here with tears rolling down my face, I remember how I felt when my son was born. Nothing could prepare me for how I felt. I knew, in that moment, that I could die happy. I love my wife and son so much I would die for them in a heartbeat. Why God chose to bless me with a beautiful, loving wife and a son. I wish I could go back and fix all of the poor choices I made and maybe I wouldn't be such a failure. A failure as a husband, a provider, a father, a brother, a son, and failure as a child of God. Thank you so much for helping me to cry for all of my missed opportunities. Congratulations on the birth of your son  and know that you are both gonna be incredible parents.
I don't know why, I'm also crying..... Love you 💞 guys...❤️
CONGRATS
I am so happy for you guys! I can’t wait to see your baby grow up

I also gave birth 2 months ago and it was  the worst pain in my life,i took some other meds they gave me but it didnt help much and last 10 min they ran out of med so it was..i cant even describe.  After i gave birth i was extremely shaky also,and i get shaky also when somethings happen like operations or going to the dentist...i think its response to stress.  Good luck with the baby☘️☘️☘️☘️

#Girlpower 😎
Yaaaay!
CONGRATULATIONS
Matt you are the best husband for being there and being so strong for Abby. She needed you and your son needed you and you came through. Abby, you are truly amazing and incredible. You are such a great wife and mom. At no time did you ever snap at Matt, even through the pain. I know love is the best medicine for any pain and it makes it bearable. Never stop encouraging each other, no matter how many years and how many kids have marked your union.   I am crying so much right now. For utter joy for the two of you and your little bundle of joy. And weeping from sadness, because I never got blessed with a strong or present partner to do this with. I had to face my nightmare of this horrible pain alone, with the strangers that were the birthing unit doctors and nurses as my only company.   For every mom that had or has the blessing of having your spouse or partner at your side, comforting, complimenting and encouraging, in birthing and in life, never let them go and never treat them wrong. Love them always and be grateful for the gift that is them. To the women thinking about having children, if your partner won't do this and won't be willing to be there for you, you've got the wrong man. Find the right the right one and he will make you and your children proud.  Matt and Abby, congratulations with all my love and prayers for your new little miracle!
thats my birthday too! congrats!
Wow that's so sweet congratulations!!!
Congratulations you did so good I’m so happy for y’all ☺️🥰❤️

Congratulations guys! Beautiful video! Not gonna lie, although I'm grateful my son's labor and delivery was quick (only about 3.5 hours total of active labor and I dilated from 1.5cm to 10+2cm in that time), I'm jealous you were able to get the epidural. I wanted it at every contraction 😂 I dilated so quick and progressed so fast unknowingly, that I had to deliver him natural lol.
A piece of cake for this strong lady! Congratulations family! 💕
Im sorry but the beginning is so fucking cringe

Watching this brought back so many memories to when I had my little guy 10 weeks ago! You did amazing! And I also got really shaky from the epidural!  Matt… what an amazing support you were!
Omg congrats love y’all so much ❤️
Congratulations guys
So fucking cringe people post this kinda stuff on the internet
Yayyyyyyy! I’ve been waiting for this all day. I’m so happy for you guys!!!!😭♥️
Omg!! The long wait is over! Congratulations guys🥺❤️
Being induced is soooo much more painful then natural labour! I was induced for my first.  I barely made it to 6cm.  My second was at a birth clinic, all natural.  I made it to 10cm so easily.. it was the transition and pushing that made me panic and regret for a moment not getting an epidural but 20 mins later baby was here and I didn’t regret it lol  it natural labour VS being induced is totally different pain wise.
Omg!!!!!! Baby boy is here!!!!!! Congrats!! You are so strong abby
OH MY GOSH HE IS THE MOST ADORABLE BABY IVE EVER SEEN! YALL ARE GONNA BE SUCH AMAZING PARENTS I ALREADY KNOW IT! WERE SO PROUD OF YOU ABBY!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Wow, just wow!! Abby you did an amazing job & Matt is probably the most supportive husband I've ever personally seen. His constant positive reassurances were so sweet. I've got 2 girls of my own, ages 19 & 14 & this took me right back to each of their births. When I was in labor with my oldest the anesthesiologist was in emergency surgery so I ended up not getting the epidural because by the time he was available it would have been pointless. She weighed in at a whopping 8lbs 4.6oz & I thought I was going to die.... literally! I'm only 5'3, 145lbs pregnant so it was like giving birth to an elephant 🐘, lol! My youngest daughter's labor I did get the epidural but I asked for it way to early out of fear of not being able to get it again. I hated being stuck in the bed. She only weighed 6lbs 7oz though so she came without to much effort. My oldest is due with my first grandbaby, a girl, August 5th. I can't imagine watching her do this in the next few weeks! Congratulations guys!! He is a handsome little dude 💙!!
YAAAAAYYYYY
🥰👶🏼❤️💐
I CRIED. Congrats guys
I’m so happy!! The way Abby was talking to the lil dude when he was born was adorable! Love you guys 💙 Congratulations!!!!🎊

Congratulations guys love you
CONGRATULATIONS 🎊
Congrats I hope u have a nice and healthy baby lil dude came outtttt
First of all CONGRATS you guys on such a special milestone and beautiful baby! Truly nothing like this feeling.  Secondly omg, the anxiety this vlog gave me! If any first time moms are watching, please know labor doesn’t have to be THIS hard, or long! And all for a very normal Sized baby- barely 8 pounds!  Girl, your contractions were  killer bc of that dang pitocin ! It makes them worse. And totally unnecessary when actual labor starts naturally. The baby was not ready to come at all and so many signs pointed to that! It’s perfectly normal and safe to be overdue, whether you have a big baby or not. Due dates are just an estimate, they really don’t mean a thing! Laboring on your back is literally the worst position, and makes it harder bc it goes against gravity. And the shakes are from the epidural. It’s literally adrenaline.  This is not shaming Matt or Abby, as they are first time parents and had no idea. I have been there too. I just hope you get different doctors next time! Or look into different delivery methods for your own sake lol
I have the shaky thing too 😂, I always get it when I get an iv so they always have to redo it
Congrats
Can wait to see the journey up ahead congrats♡♡♡♡
Omg omg omg watching NOW!
This was so beautiful to watch. Thank you for sharing. So happy for you guys!
AHHHHHH U GUYS ARE GOING TO THE BEST PARENTS CONGRATULATIONS GUYSSS

Congratulations I can’t believe after all this time you baby boy was finally born 💗
Congrats! and also it was probably the epidural that was causing the shakes it is side effect of it!
Congratulations guys! He is so cute!!! Abby I think I gave birth in that same room at Honor Health on Shea. I had all 3 of my kiddos there and your room is the same as I remember it was for me when I had my daughter. They are such a great hospital. So happy everyone is healthy and safe.

Literally in tears at how supportive Matt was. Congratulations!!! I’m so happy for you guys
Congratulations
The shakes ! Ive gotten them with all 3 my labors 🫶🏼🥲
I get to share a birthday with you son
Abby, you are truly a warrior mama. I had a verrryyyy long labor too and those pitocin contractions are no joke. I’ve done it without pitocin and the contractions are completely different and it’s so much more manageable with contractions your body gives. You did it without any pain management on pitocin for HOURS and you should feel so proud and empowered because you are incredible! Just wanted to remind you of that, mama!!
CONGRATS YALLL!!
I cant believe it. I have been watching you guys through the good and bad. Congratulations, cant wait for yall to have that little guy running around yalls house! Again, congrats
Congrats guys.

Omggg CONGRATULATIONS ABBY and MATT!!! He is so HANDSOME! Watching this brought me flash backs to when I gave birth. It wasn’t as smooth as your delivery went but all I could do was smile, cry and remember the time I met my son for the first time 🥹 Watching this is making me want another baby already 😂 ENJOY all his firsts! He definitely changed your world from the beginning of pregnancy and he will continue to that for the rest of your life!!   I have this baby swaddle with a poem on it. I got it from my friend and I never used it on my son cause I didn’t want it to get ruined, so I hung it up on my ceiling so I could read it everyday! And it says,   Hold Me A Little Longer Rock Me A Little More. Tell Me Another Story  Tell Me Just One More. Let Me Sleep On Your Shoulder Cherish My Happy Smile. For I Am Only A Little Baby For Such A Little While.  I cried when I got it. But just a little something to remind you that he won’t be a little baby for that long. Even though he will always be your baby lol my son will be a Toddler next month which is so crazy to me cause I feel like he was 3 months old last month lol the time flys by so fast!!!   Congratulations again and I hope Abby has a speedy recovery! Can’t wait for the name reveal !!
Congratulations guys 😭❤️

Aw congratulations. You did fantastic.
Congrats!!!!!
Congrats and thank you for sharing this beautiful moment with us❤ I'm over here sobbing like a baby😭 You did a good job Momma😊
My mum went through all of her labors without any pain meds (like epidural)… I honestly have no idea how she went through 7 kids like that… especially after seeing this and how much pain Abby was in at 4 cm😅
congratulations❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations 🥳 you guys are such great parents!
The way he comforted her was everything I started crying when he said you got this
That was awesome!  Congratulations on your new little blessing.
Congratulations
Length and weight???  Abby did a great job, she looks so small in comparison to that baby bump she was carrying. I wasn't sure she could deliver normally because of it. I can only imagine the pain, but I've had to pass 8 kidney stones where I needed to be in an ER. I've had many others where I passed them at home using some pain killers I have on hand, like Percocet. Women who have had a stone and a baby tell me  the stone pain is worse! I have no way of knowing as I'm a man.
Congratulations guys very beautiful
So precious thank you so much for sharing with us. I'm bawling and feel like part of your family I'm so happy. He is beautiful.

Matt poured so much love onto Abby. When your baby boy finally made his entrance I couldn’t help but cry tears of joy . What a precious family you guys are. There’s nothing I’d love more than to build a life like the one you guys created. I love you guys so so much and you’ll forever be my favorite influencers. Can’t wait to see more of your journey and of your sweet boy❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹

congratulation guys☺😇
LITTLE DUUUDDEE!!! Welcome to the world buddy!
He so so cute haaaaaaa congratulations 🎉🥳
AHHHHHHH YAY!! I'm so happy for you guys!❤❤❤
Congratulations! I have 3(grown) boys and they are great. A lot of work as they are so busy but the best!! Pit contractions are so intense as I was induced with all 3 but end result is so worth it. Matt was a great cheerleader! I had to tell my husband to just be silent as all the noise was bothering me and I just wanted peace and quiet 🤫!! Best of luck on your new addition and I can not wait to see more videos of him. Remember sleep when he sleeps all housework can wait as you need your rest too. Take all the help you can get. I breastfeed all 3 so hubby would get them and change them and bring them to me. It was a great system and that way he had one on one time with them also.  Remember to cover his privates when you change him so you don't get sprayed!! Lol! Enjoy every moment as it goes by in a flash let me tell you as mine are 29(in Nov), 27, and 22(23 this month on the 22nd) but they are still my babies!!!!
Congratulations, what a joy and blessing when you become parents first time. Cherish every moment they go by to fast .
I’m so proud of you Abby and you did a wonderful job mat i love you guys and you are going to be such wonderful parents

Awwww congrats
CONGRATTSS
We have been waiting for this day from the day you posted your were pregnant video congrats!!
Yaaaaas queeen💙💙💙
It’s horrible seeing them induce for no reason . Intervention after intervention. The reason it’s so painful is bc pitocin speeds it up unnaturally. Then epidural slows birth down . And pushing on your back is the WORST position to be in . And I hope my man doesn’t continuously tell me in my ear how strong I am , a bit excessive there Matt .
Congratulations Guys 😘😊🎉
Ong can't wait to watch this, congrats....he looks so beautiful, even just from the thumbnail 😍🥰
Congratulationsss Matt and Abby!!! He is soo perfect, I can see that you both are soo happy. And I know he is a newborn, but I can't wait to see the Disney Trip Vlogsss!!!! Sending you the best of wishes on this happy and magical time!

Omg I am so happy for you guys
Matt is the sweetest guy ever!! Congrats!!!! I'm so happy for you two!! My cousin is actually 8 days overdue. She was inducted Sunday but no baby. The baby's heart rate was slowing down so they almost had an emergency C-section. It got back to normal so they didn't have the C-section.

OMFG YASS CONGRATS
Congratulations!!! What a beautiful baby boy!!! 💙💙
So you had him on July 3 and that’s my moms and nieces birthday
Congratulations on the new arrival 😁👶
Congratulations to you both. It's terrifying when a shoulder is stuck. So thankful you had an experienced birthing team who were able to recognize it immediately. Some mothers aren't so lucky, as it can be a devastating complication.
Omg I cried watching this I have been here since day 1 ilysm
I feel like Matt has yet to leave the hospital, as the staff was like, you are so good at this, can you do 12 more births? Like Rob Lowe in Parks and Rec, they just keep him at the hospital to be the OG birth companion
Congratulations guys!!🎉🎊 so happy for ya'll.  He is so precious! 💙😍🥰

Fast births hurt SO much! The epidural can’t keep up. I have 2 kids; my first I went from 2cm to 10cm in 2 hrs (naturally), 6 pushes later he was born (8lb 13oz). With my second I went from 4 to 10 in 30 minutes, I vomited from the pain, and my baby girl slipped out (the Dr wasn’t even there, it happened so quickly, luckily i was at the hospital though). Giving birth is such a crazy experience. Congratulations!!
OMG IM CRYING!!! i was SO excited for y’all to have a baby!! y’all are amazing and my favorite youtubers and i am sending prayers the baby boy will be healthy and strong ❤️❤️
I was 16 seconds in and I was already crying 🥹 god bless you all and I wish your baby lots of health, for Abby to have the best recovery and for Matt lots of strength 🤍
I had baby #5, our second little boy, 3 months ago... I cried watching this because I just got to experience that moment again, it is a miracle... No words describe that moment you meet your baby for the first time. 💙 Congratulations. 💖
Yayyyy abbyyyyy I have been watching you for like 3 years. Bestie you deserve this baby. You get are gonna be such good parents, like I can tell from everything you’ve done leading up to this. I love you guys soooooo much. CONGRATS!!!!!!!!STRONG MAMAS FOR THE WIN
We had the same birth, aside from the epidural part! I had a little lip when I was nearly ready to push, they helped get baby’s head past it while I pushed a little, 20 minutes of pushing, baby got a shoulder stuck (mine was nearly 9.5 lbs) and the nurses SWIFTLY threw my legs up high and had be push hard! I was none the wiser either lol… found out afterwards. I remember my midwife’s attitude changing a bit and I honestly thought she was getting annoyed with me, until she told me he was just a little stuck.
He has his eyes wide open oh gosh so beautiful
Definitely emotional after watching this !! So beautiful !
Congratulations he so precious!!! I’m due in a few weeks can’t wait to meet our little dude.
The only words I have are, AAAHHHHHHHHH<3 and congrats as well!💕🥳✨
Congratulations on the baby 👶🎉🥳

Congratulations!!! The difference between  Induction and natural labor is so different. Induced labor is generally more painful and you have less endorphins flowing! I had to have an epidural with my induction. Then my following 2 labors were natural! One of them was a 10 pound baby too! Way different!

The shaking and chattering of your teeth are totally normal when you have the epidural and you’re in pre labor stages it’s nothing to do with being cold it’s just because that’s how your body and your nervous system handles things that epidural might be helping you but no matter what your body still going to be wondering what kind of pain it’s in and that’s why you get the shocks or jolts of shaking.. thank you guys so much for posting this video I’ve been waiting for so long I’m so excited I’m only five minutes in cannot wait I’m going to cry already know

AHHHHHHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YALL!! I was babysitting and I went in YouTube to check and I almost screamed!!!
Labor makes you shake. Epidural doesn’t make you high at all it’s only to numb you up. If you get Fentanyl then you would get high but that’s through the IV an epidural it’s just local anesthetic that goes into your back and has no effect on your mind
I've never seen a sweeter man than Matt!
He’s soooooo cute. I cried🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Congratulations to all of you. Now enjoy your new life. Love watching yall

I know this will probably sound so weird and before I say it, I’m female so in no way am I being creepy:) When Abby is having contractions at around the 4:40ish area, she looks absolutely gorgeous and just so beautiful. To me that shows just how truly pure and sincere her heart and soul is. I’m in awe of her beauty as she is in birthing pains and her soul and motherly gift from God is radiating outward. They are both going to be such amazing parents.
IM CRYING!!!! You guys are going to raise such an awesome baby. You guys are amazing!
Congrats Abby and Matt! I have been watching from the beginning and I am excited to welcome the new darling into the world! Sending lots of love from my family to yours!❤

CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR LITTLE DUDE 👣✌
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Literally cried watching this. Abby you are so strong . Proud of you mama Lil dude.. welcome to earth angel😘
Congrats on the baby !! God bless but just a fact epidurals numb a woman's body,silencing the communication from her baby, shutting down her primal instincts. BIRTH RELIES ON THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MOTHER AND BABY. DRUGS SILENCE THE CUES FROM BABY TO MOTHER, SO BABIES HAVE TO TRY TO BIRTH THEMSELVES.
Congratulations!!!
Congrats to you all hope he's healthy he's so cute stay safe we will prey for good times💞💞💞💞
Congratulations 💙

Guys, I'm all in tears <3 We were watching your labour with my, freshly passed, 6yo daughter!!! We never could imagine her being so big, because she started from 24th week on NICU. Only 530gr heavy and 30cm long... It's incredible what God made out of this tiny body!!! Thank you for praying out loud Abby and thank God for a beautiful faithful family you ARE!!! Love from Poland, Lili & Rose
I'm literally trying not to cry you guys are the sweetest. Abby, you did great and it's so sweet of you to have put off the epidural for the other mom, you go girl <3 Matt you're awesome. Can't wait to see more of lil dude *hugs*
Aww.  ❤🕊❤
Congratulations!!!!! You did so goooood <3 :) :) :) :) Yaaaaaaay!
Abby wasn’t sure about showing birth online but she dived right in and gave it all 🤣🤣 congrats to the new parents!!
awe that was so sweet congrats to both of you Abby u did amazing u listed to ur body and stayed focused Matt u was a great comfort and encouraging, now comes the new chapter of ur life the joy and pleasure of watching little dude grow it going to be wild but so worth it. much love to u both and little dude god bless you all too🙏❤😘
MATT IS OFFICIALLY THE BEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD! Abby and Matt, congratulations, I started bawling crying when I heard the baby’s cry and when Matt was saying such nice and encouraging words to Abby while she was giving birth, such a nice husband, I know you guys will be the best parents and lil dude is so ADORABLE🥰!! Once again congrats and Abby, you are SO STRONG AND INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL. so is your child. I’m so excited to find out lil dudes name and once again, you guys will be the best parents. Waking up in the middle of the night, feeding lil dude, hearing those small baby cry’s, they are all something new parents go through, but then you eventually get used to it! Abby is a champ and so is lil dude. There are so many challenges you have to go through with being new parents, but it’s always the hardest ones become drilled into your memory and become the ones you miss the most. It’s better to remember all the best moments and take as many pictures and videos as you can with lil dude because, oh man, time goes by fast and babies grow fast as-well, it’s crazy! I love you guys so much and to death, please stay healthy and I wish your small family to grow healthy and to stay safe. It’s the start of a new chapter in both yours and Matt’s lives so make the most of it! I’m so excited to see lil dude grow to become such a gentleman like matt. I hope you see this comment and know that you guys are the BEST YouTubers officially. I LOVE YOU GUYS TO DEATHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!🥰🥰💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💗💗💗💗
OMG!!! As soon as I saw this I got so excited Matt is so sweet:)
you guys had me crying happy tears by the end! welcome to the world lil dude! abby you’re so so strong and you both are amazing parents, love you guys!! 💕

I love u
I cried like a baby watching this. You did amazing and to see that level of encouragement and support from Matt was incredible. It’s the type of birth experience I wish I would’ve had. And the supportive type of birth every mother deserves ❤️ congratulations on your little bundle of joy, he is precious 💙 I’m praying for all of you and wishing you a speedy recovery in your 4th trimester Abby 💗
Ahhh I’m soooooooo happy congrats sooo happy for you guys
Awwww omg i have been waiting for this moment i have watched abbys pregnancy vids all day i have been waiting till abby found out shes pregnant till now .Little dude got amazing parents💙
Congratulations!
Love from Minnesota..
Future story  On July 3rd you were born, and just before you were born, your mom was craving chick fil a. But it was a Sunday
This made me cry 😭 I’m so proud of you! Congratulations to you both 💕
Congratulations he is so cute you guys are gonna be the best parents ever all the best♥♥♥♥♥
Congratulations 🎉🎉
I labored to 4cm at home before I went to the hospital. I agree with you, worst pain of my life. (SO worth it in the end) After that, the epidural saved the day and made the birthing process so enjoyable until the pushing started. Isn’t it crazy how in the moment it’s the hardest thing you’ve ever done, but as soon as you hear that baby cry you instantly forget about everything you just went through? That is a mothers love. Best husband award definitely goes to Matt! He was so supportive & super sweet. Beautiful baby and great job Abby! 💕
What’s his name????
Balling over here 😭 brings back memories of my lil ones. Such a blessing 🙌 ✨️  Congratulations 👶👣
CONGRATS ABBY AND MATT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE AMAZING PARENTS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS WE HAVE ALL WAITED 9 MONTHS!!!

Congratulations! You have a wonderful family!
I am crying like hell !!! This was so beautiful !!! Matt's expressions the whole time !!! OMG... I cried

Oh my goodness, brought sweet tears to my eyes, thank you.  Reminded me of giving birth to my two little ones who are now 3 and 6.

God bless your family for so many more years to come! 🙏💜💙  I remember w/my first child, I was kinda mean w/ my significant other. He was really trying to be nice during labor (the waiting game), asking if I wanted ice, a cool washcloth, etc, & nope! I didn't want a flippin thing from HIM nor did I even want to hear his voice, esp during an active contraction. Lol.  So KUDOS @Abby you're much better   me! 🤣🤷‍♂️   Omg & I was just like you! A smaller contraction b4 epidural was like death! But once I got that epidural, I didn't even know I was having smaller contractions. Heck I even managed to take a short nap!! 🤣

Unbelievable! Endless love what you three celebrating with every moment of this special experience becoming parents.
