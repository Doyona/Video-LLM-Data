Use this comment as an “I <3 Cody” button 👋🖲️
Austin was the most entertaining this show has ever been
This isn’t even dating. This is “How to make someone feel like shit”.
am I the only one left?
im glad cody wasnt taking their horrible suggestions
Anybody here... post allegations?
Big fat girls choosing... that's unreal.
Make a statement on Cody Ko allegations
Cut, please never let Cody Ko back on your videos. Tana Mongeau has alleged that he, at age 25, slept w/ her, when she was 17 years old. Gabbie Hanna has substantiated these allegations in the past. This is NOT OKAY. If you have him on again, I will absolutely unsubscribe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY_fY5qk6-0&ab_channel=D%27AngeloWallace
That one girl with the black hair was so into the box aka Cody😂😂
I don’t even know this guy BUT I wish he was in every video now!😂😂
Jesse was hot! ❤
emil my love
“You like the gym?” Is wild
While we are watching this, Jesse is probably getting pegged at the moment
Cody is boring and soooo unfunny
DO YOU LIKE THE GYM
"You ever been to court." 😂😂
11:46
Cody on the button is perfection
Austin better end up alone, no woman deserves that.
GodDAMN, my man, Austin was REAL blunt when he said that woman wasn't attractive to her face. Props for honesty though...I guess? But I feel bad for her
yooo bulgarian bro, you shuld skip this pig
THAT MAN WAS BRUTALLY RUDE LIKE IF HE TALKING TO THE GIRL LIKE THAT NEAR ME OR AROUND ME I WILL ROCK THE HELL OUT OF HIM FKING RUDE 😡
jai was so fucking funny 😭
Wild
10:52 SHES SO PRETTY
the last couple... when she said she is dissacociative... i have struggeled with that for years and if she felt something with him he will help her so much.
I would let that last girl destroy my life.
Austin looks like he was dishonorably discharged from the military and doesn’t know how to handle it 😭
the baby skull thing genuinely gave me full body chills i’m assuming he was talking about a fontanelle which would mean he likes touching the unprotected part till it squishes which is literally horrifying
bro this ep was fking wild 😭😭
whos the last girl cuz she kinda…
This one is toooo fukn wilddd!!
GET THE STRAP GET THE STRAP GET THE STRAP GET THE STRAP GET THE STRAP
when he was too slow it had me dyingggggg
HE said do you like the GYM😭😭😭
Cody’s reactions are everything 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Stay Humble / It's Never Luck !!!!!!! Amen
Jesse spelled with a z and an x?!?!? Jazxe or Jaxze?
10:23 Ooh, pegging, now we're talking~
Stop. Jesse and that girl are so freaking cute together I’m dead
The black dress girl too much attitude
Big girl just wanted to rejected somebody to feel better
I love how cody always ask "who let me have this much fun?" on his channel and ots so amazing to see him having a BLAST voicing the button
I love that Cosy got to essentially Wingman for his boi Jesse. JESSE DESERVES ALL THE LOVE.
Austin thinks he's a player and he's really just annoying as fuck
Jesse is fine ❤
"Do you like the gym"~ Emil😂😂
Austin is the devil
2:18 "Get you in shape" JAW. DROPPED.
i need more of THIS Cut
This guys muscles are horrible… they looked BAD
jai was so funny (unintentionally?) omg  edit: this whole episode was extra funny
This is by far the funniest episode of the button I’ve seen and I’m only two minutes in
Jesse is a stud.
why do y’all continue to invite austin back knowingly he makes women uncomfortable
LOL u need to start editing the button with the pov of the button's voice every time doesn't have to just be when cody does it
Jai is jokes
Austin is an incel. he should not be allowed on shows like this
Ugh, Austin. Nope.
6:53 "Short guys are cool too tho" -singer of Short King's Anthem
I never comment anything here on youtube but this episode cracked me up loll😂😂😂
this is my roman empire
all losers
Can we just appreciate Jai🤞🏾🧡😂
Jesse is super handsome!!! Don't tell my husband I said that
11:31 luv her
We need Emil back
Hmm AustIiIIIIIIInNNNN
Holy shit Austin was ruthless!
that firs girl was annoying lmaoo
Ew, Austin is so disgusting 🤢
BRING IN LUDWIG!!!!!
Y’all HAVE to have Cody on again. This was awesome. You could tell he was so happy to be there. And the button being that funny was 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
whats the last girls O.F? for a friend of course
I need Austin as a best friend I love his energy 😂
Have you ever been to court? Do you go to gym, HAHAHAHAHAim dying
So sweet of Cody Ko to help Markiplier find a partner who's willing to peg him
that Austin dude 💀💀💀💀💀😂😂
3:00 she knew what's up 😂😂😂
fcking Austin again
i actually need emil so bad
Need more cody ko as button !!
Absolutely love the first girl-her humor was phenomenal 😂
Probably my fav one till now 😂😂
Austinnnnnnn! Buttonnnnnn! 😂😂😂
Who is kody ko
Would have skipped the first girl so fast, she really has the nerve to say she works out and looks like that there's no way that's just terrible
There is nothing wrong with looking older than you are. If you want him to lie, just don't ask or say "lie to me" foh lolol
who is that last girl?
I would love him to Button me
They even brought Cody's favourite characters. Such a nice touch.
Anybody else in love with the cat girl?!
12:11 omg these two are fucking insufferable. 🤣🤣🤣
do they put instagram user names for people who take part? :)
Please get Aba and Preach on here 😭
invite aba and preach next
The behind the scenes cut aways to hear the reactions of the producers and stuff made this episode a million times better 🤣 pleeease do this in more of these lol
The last girl has some confidence. She truly knows her value
last girl was the most stupid
Austin is dope
She way to confident looking built a grocery bag about to bust at the  seams
the way Austin called her physically unattractive is actually insane. You could tell she was rushing to get out of there hurt 😭
I love austin
This is so iconic for him
Not that😅
You like the gym😂😂
This episode had so many weirdos! Fantastic content 🤣🤣🤣
2:13 HELP why did he look her up and down after she said that
Austin is such an asshole please don't let him come back. on previous videos he's incredibly rude and you can just tell he's misogynist
The crackhead energy guy😂he is so nervous around her because he actually finds her cute..thats kind of adorable ❤
Pls tell me the last girl has instagram
Chunkey monkey😭🙏
Austin is crazyyy
"i'll Get you a shape" is deadly 😂
Dont tell me im the only one who heard bro said you like the gym to the fat person😂
2:13 seconds  stopp the capp
Austin was gross
I love Jai !!!!!! She is so funny man
Cody was great, can we get Conan to do this??!
would've been better to just clip Cody in the corner of the video while he's voicing the button. Mixing his voice with the sound filter just takes away the charm of the Button's voice.
put me on this show
where is the girl who mentioned pegging's @???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? asking for ME not a friend i need it
cody making everyone laugh oh my godddd
Actually that only whisper thing cody did on his channel sounds like it would really work!!
THE JEZXE GIRL WAS SO HOT IM SORRY
8:21 I hope they cut out him saying "to me" after "physically attractive" because she is fine as hell
Some people just dont look good with muscle.  This dude is definitely one of them.
ew austin
Oooooohh Jesse gettin’ pegged tonight! 🎉
8:23  Was the best thing ever 😂
Everybody talking about Cody but can we talk about how funny Jai is 😭✋️
I love the last girl. She has crazy energy (in a good way), humbled tf out of that jerk Austin, and made Jesse feel comfortable
Austin needs to go in the trash IMMEDIATELY!!!
This is like seeing Tom holland play spiderman ps4
Austin was wild oh my god 😭😭 immediately hitting the button
Do we ever get to see the second dates??
hearing how shocked the Cut people are by some of the contestants answers behind the scenes makes this so much more funnier
Bro Jai reminds me of Twomad 😂
Button Cody was wise and funny.
W Ej
11:47 THAT ONE LHYSCO GHY
Miss Jai is everything, I love her. Bring her back a hundred times.
2:48 what did that biash say???? Dissing a whole culture like that...
Austin is disgusting.
i just found this and never heard of this game show. is this a us show or where can i find on tv?
so upset no one commented on the first guys ´kate & naomi´t shirt.
Hello everyone
7:03 I THOUGHT DREW GOODEN WALKED ON FOR A SEC WHAT
14:10 “Its spelled with a z and an x” was lowkey smooth 😭
Austin was an ass but goddamn he made this video entertaining. I did find him cringe in another video tho.
the woman that won is amazing. We had some weirdos on here but she beat their energy 😂
WHO IS THAT WOMAN I NEED HER
this is all cringe
Tiny Meat Gang in the house
I wish i matched with that final girl 😭😭😭
Who is the last girl name?
The first girl is wild 😂😂😂
Liking Drake he should ask himself that question!
Woman who said Jez had the same name as her brother is obnoxious!!!!
it love jesse hes so cool and cute lmao
THIS KILLED DF OUT OF ME 💀 0:59
Austin is so rude. My gosh
Austin zesty 💅
I understand why they brought Cody in. They know this show sucks and needed someone famous to generate clicks.
The mf in the Hawaiian shirt talking about sucking 😭 dude wtf is wrong w u 💀
We need more Cody please
Sorry but that first girl was so cringe cause likeeee eugh
Him: I'm 5'8 Her: How tall is that? I'm 5'6 Me watching: *dial-up noise*
*THIS IS SATAN MUAHAHAHAHHA*  jk it’s the button :3
Did they not have any attractive woman?
that was a chaotic conclusion
This has to be Cody’s job it’s the best button episode omg
😂😮😂 1:45
is no one gonna tell him about the pegging.....? 😶
austin was horrific
Jesse is so cute!!! 😅😊
The last girl was fucking hilarious
I like Serena and Jessie made a cute couple
This show is giving me Jubilee vibes. How is this not Jubilee?!
I honestly didn't like the vibes of the first lady
Опа България
My fave lines: Are you cracked the fuck out? - Exc- sorry? You're giving me crackhead energy
The way I love this man
I love how they got together at the end. They look so hot together
Austin is cringe af
"do u like the gym" * immediately buzzes the button*
This guy needs a raise❤❤
Okay but Jezxe looked extra fine in this video, god damn
Austin gives off clay puppington vibes
That Austin guy is just awful, no class, no charisma.
I am still really confused why Ludwig could not stream this, Ludwig I would say made the button as big as it is today.
This episode is amazing as it sounds😂
They hated Austin because he was right
Zexxie 💀
We all know that girl didn’t buy her own back stage passes
*evil button laugh*
“Mmm, button.”  😂
f for the fallen soldier at the end who will get pegged
austin's always on some sh lmao
Bro EJ got the worst luck 🤣
where yall getting these people
I need friends like Austin 😂
Everyone is talking about Cody, while I'm over here wondering if the bulgarian guy was secretly saying he does cocaine with that nose tap to the "weed" question 😂.
Austin is the Top G
Austin strikes me as a creep. I do not like him at all.
You would know if a man likes you…hahhaha the button was her defense mechanism. Haha😂
She rejected those she knew that didnt like her. Hahahhaha
Yay, jezzy or jazy finally got a match.  I've been watching him got rejected so many times and he's got a beard now, he's sexy and he's sexier now.
Random question, but does anyone know Jai's social media? I cant find anyone (other than Cody ❤️) tagged and I adore her. I'm sorry if this is odd lol
Ngl that one girl is a meanie head mcguirre
Bro strait up said, “not that.”
8:19 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I am cracking up right now man u should be faster in the next time
02:19🙂💔
Haha she has da Hawaii kine vibes in her 😂
Jesse seems to have made some good changes in life and im so damn happy to know hes doing better then the last time he was on. I was scared he was at rock bottom. I love to see him laughing and being goofy.
Cody is the only person on the internet who can make fun of someone then collab with them 🤣
Proof that people care about looks more than anything. I thought the last girl was pretty annoying, but because she was thin and pretty she didn't get buzzed. The first girl was also annoying, but the reason she got buzzed was her looks. It just sucks that this is how humans are. Someone could be insufferable, but if they look good they'll never have trouble getting a date. On the flip side someone could be kind and funny but if they are fat or not pretty they'll struggle to find love.
bro that was amazing fr
I audibly gasp at half the things Austin says
“What are you looking for” “Not that”😭
Cody looks great here. He has that new father glow.
I don't like The Button but Cody doing this has me CRACKING UP. This is the only format I ever want to see.
11:46 the black haired guys face expression look oddly familiar..MARKIPLIER i love it😭
“This is the button” sounded like “this is big brother” 😂
I wanna see Austin and Cody together lmao
This Not It.. The Button Was Cool Regular Honestly I Personally Just Feel Like This Takes Away From It
I'm only at 7:18 he's just calling out everyone XD keep em moving
austin is such a weirdo
Honestly I think if they had a camera in the production room at all time and posted reactions it would make it amazing
I love me some cody
Want more cody!!
Nah Jezsy fucked up. That b*h is insane 😅
the ow ow stop touching 😭
Dude wow 😂
di8sleike fizeram ditatura comigo. fizeram face realiti do butao mo paia isso #bianocomando
i love austin bro im cryin
The green hair babe is so funny 😂
Austin is my spirit animal.
Jai...  I'm so glad you got yours...
it only took a few mins to dislike austin frfr
Bro these people are wild
“You like the gym?” C’mon man 😂😂😂
And from that day on he wrote his name as Xezzze
My fav for sure 😂
The button looks like tom odell lol
11:45
Austin is a fucking meme at this point. If he ever finds love, maaaan I just pray for that lady.
Jai reminds me of Karina Garcia
this is the best oh my god
jai is so fucking funny
Shin is gorgeous love her voice she’s adorable
Emille I loved him
1:45 Asking "do you like the gym" to an obviously obese person 😭😭
they should have him on the show more 😭😭😭😭 he adds personality
whats jenny's @ on insta??
I loved the winners so much idk why
That girl in the Jean jacket was weird af. Watching her try to jump out of that chair was the most entertaining part
plz do more with cody, this was the best thing ever 😍
This is the only time I’ve ever genuinely enjoyed the button
Wtf is wrong with Austin lmao
I would’ve given Austin no MERCY
Hawaiian shirt guy needs to be humbled.
Austin rejects every girl because he’s not looking for a girl if you know what I mean 💅🏻
MORE
Why they got Moana on there
MORE CODY FOR THE PEOPLE !
How did a fuggo like Jai last that long??
I love Austin. I was so happy to see him, then I saw the LEGEND who came after him, and I started screaming.
I love the 4th guy he was so honest and halarious
you guys should have cody host all of them, he’s doing so much better than the original host , much more entertaining 🫶❤️
The most I’ve ever laughed at a button video 😂 Jai should be a host on the show btw
1:56 I NEED MORE BOOLETS!
WE LOVE CODYYYY
This easily becomes the best episode. We have bancho, austin, jesse, and even cody?! Shut the fudge up XD
jessi is so hot i’d fold immediately
“How come you’re bald?”
Get Wineboxpapi next
This is the best episode so far
Please have him always do this 😂
This is amazing
Austin came off as the biggest douchebag ever. Such an insecure little man child
We need lud next
8:15 OMG LOOOOOOOOOL
It’s all ugly girls
Something about referring to a black woman as “that” doesn’t sit right with me..
13:04 Unprescribed...possession of a controlled substance 😂
Austin is the definition of a red flag and toxic
She hit the button cause he wouldn’t get pegged lmao
omg Austin is such a douche. like when asked what are you looking for he says "not that".Geez
that last girl was the perfect person to bring out for austin she ate him up
The best video I never thought I would be exposed to. Lmao.
9:27 wtf kind of question is that? What an interesting episode
"THIS IS SATAN WELCOME TO HELL" lmao
I love Jai! Wanna see more of her
I love the behind the scenes view!  ❤❤❤
Get Wineboxpapi on this show please! He is the perfect fit.
“AUSTINNNN” “👹mmmm button”  idk why but that moment really got me
La primera mina es insoportable😭😭
cody’s videos ON the button get more views than the original button videos, making him the voice of the button was a power move
get jesse and austin back!!!!
THE FIRST GIRL WAS SO REAL BRO
Since May but Cody is funny
Jai was damn salty with the buff guy, trying to take several "subtle" jabs at him after he accidentally mentioned she was obese... that bald bit, with it being the culture, was *super* awkward lol
This is the funniest shit ive seen in a while ily cody🤣🤣
9:40, we going to act like this man did not just pull a 500 Iq play
This was honestly one of the funniest episodes
1:43 he knew wassup 💀
Annnnnnnd this is right up my allleyyyyyyyyyyyy . Yep yep yep yep yep
Serena if it doesn't work out im here.
Okay, but most of all, I liked seeing the reactions of the crew and their interpretations of stuff, I wanna see/hear more of the crew!
Um they’re my favorite pairing ever. NEED UPDATE.
Okay Austin may not be the nicest guy in the room, but he's incredibly entertaining 🤣🤣
shoutout to the cute lil shoutout of Cody's new song at the end, awwwww. @cut i lov u
Here for Cody
Yeah my biggest fear is those people who off-screen laughs at my every word when I'm being completely serious
Cody made thepis 10x more entertaining and funny to watch
Austin to me is a walking red flag 😂
Reddit admin meets bonco
I can’t get over  “How tall are you?” “5’8” “How tall is that?” Like babe….five foot eight inches?!? 😂
1:45 “Do you like the gym” reminds me of “Do you like the cure” 😭
1:10 “do you like the cure” and Heely’s 😭😭guy
my type is definitely not people that do the button on the first red switch
DUDE AUSTIN WAS SO RUDEEE
This needs to be a permanent series it’s even funnier seeing the players’ live reactions to his commentary
Get you in shape comment omg i'd die
What happened with the new ep with Cody?? It disappeared….
Omg please get Ludwig to do it next 😂
Mostly 200 pound women and regular size dudes….ok
this was like the best episode, I laughed to tears with this one, loved it!
This is iconic
aw they're gonna go do adderall together 🫶🏻
The "I'm on my knees💍, then im on ny knees again🧎‍♂️"🤣🤣🤣 too much
austin is hilarious
Now its final
One of the best episodes I’ve seen
Omg I love this! 😍😍 that’s awesome! He really metaled and doubt the winners would’ve gotten together if it weren’t for him pushing them. What a treat to see Cody behind the wheel 😂
i been waiting for this
the "you like the gym?" after "you ever been to court?" is wild 😭😭
Cody is the Ultimate Wingman 👏🏼👏🏼
This was amazing!!
Dude Jesse is so handsome!!!!
The last two people seem equally horrible and perfect for each other
jai made my day
11:46
I <3 Cody” button 👋🖲
I like it better when the button didn’t have a face.
i haven’t laughed this hard in a LONG time oh my god
get luddy
poor man doesnt know hes gonna get pegged
they're absolutely wild to bring back who they brought back but i completely understand why they did it
That girl was such a "pick me"
This was the hardest I've laughed for an episode of the Button
that guy got pegged during the Adderal deal in the parking lot after this video
Omg finally Cody is the part of this show, but i hope he would be the one looking for a date one day lol
I think the production should have intervened when Austin said those awful things.
Serena met Austin and immediately read him as an asshole and got rid of him
i never thought the day would come
Ive never laughed harder during an episode this one was a lot to unpack 😭😭
O primeiro garoto é um Deus grego, alguém tem o insta dele?
Fatterina is mad funny 😂
This episode has so many qoutables man 😭  "How come you're bald"  "He kinda looked at me like oh she chunkey monkey"   *Misses chance to press button* "ohh you were too slow"  "What are you into?"  "Not that-"   "So you sucking dick in the back then?"  "Hypthetical: What if I wanna peg you our engagement night"  "You give me crackhead energy"
What is this a crossover episode??
Having recreational adderall during a national shortage... Good on her for not pressing the button because i would not have overlooked that.
Austin is the real life version of Bert  from Sesame Street 😂
Imagine a guy going yeah no am not into small boobs sorry😂 but women going only tall men please!! What a double standard like guys cannot change their height!!
cody's favourite (jesse) winning was so wholesome and that couple looked so good together tbh. austin's and cody's vague beef was hilarious😭
loved this and cody
This IS THE BESTTTT! Where do u find these people????
Diversitile  Real cool Austin  Go back to Charm School lil buckaroo  👩‍🏫
fatty is not it she's so annoying 😭😭
I truly can’t believe that Austin is a real person
the show is 100% better when cody voices the button
Noooicee
that was the best episode ever
this has to be one of the funniest episodes  of the button ever done
cody's absolute DELIGHT when he saw austin is SENDING me 💀
emile is hot 😍
12:30 - Hands down the best human I've seen on this show so far. It's like he's Markiplier's hidden, better looking brother!
Why did Austin pass on blondie? I thought he was into her af
Full-Circle moment right here!! Proud of you Cody, you nailed it👏🏽😂😂 Hope to see you be in more of these episodes as the button!
FINALLYYYY
I SCREAMEDDDD OMG THIS IS AMAZING
i want moooooooooooore
Amazing video guys I love the way you balance the screen time. Also showing love to cody's music was so nice.
That was the best button episode. Cody living his dream was everything
YOOO! 😂 taking the button away right after it lights up is wiiild 😂😂
I really like it best when the people can only kick themselves out. When you can kick someone else out, it becomes a contest to see who can hit the button first. That's not fun.
To the girl with the green/black hair and pink shirt, you're beautiful! 💕No one needs the approval of that little prick any way...😒
I fell in love with the pegging girl
best button yet!
More Cody ko!
Jezxie is my favorite
That Jai girl was incredibly annoying
ALRIGHT WHO LET HIM HAVE FUN
cody ko as the button MORE!!!!!
🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬❤️
girl in black will be single forever.
That’s so cool that cut used Cody’s song as the outro!
FINALLYYYY
This episode was wild, cody killed it
This episode got wild towards the end lmao
Respect to Austin bro.
Banko is bald cause he’s from Baldgaria
Poor Jezxie 😂
Can we just have Cody permanently...
Austin is the rudest MF 9:32
It was strange seeing people shake their left hands. Is that something people do?
All these people kinda suck.
First girl was hilarious lmfao
“👀😅 I have some in my bag… 🤭 *loud whispers* 𝓾𝓷𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓼𝓬𝓻𝓲𝓫𝓮𝓭, I just like how it feels” thank u jesse, for leaving me gobsmacked again
Plot twist: Cody has always been The Button
Need Emile @
This needs to be permanent
does anyone know who the last girl is!? she's stunning and i love her energy so much ! unhinged in the best way possible hahahaha
Next we need Ludwig
nice
get ludwig on
Cody was such a good fucking button. To say he quipped is to do his commentary injustice. His words and my subconscious were one.
BI
HAVE HIM ON MORE PLEASE
“MMMM BUTTON” killed me
Having him on the button is such a good idea
AYOO
So awkward but very funny
I love Cody so much
Chinese girl needa take whatever she could get you all found some homely ass chix
WE NEED MORE BUTTON VIDEOS WITH CODY! He killed it. Best button video yet
funniest and best episodes by far
THIS WAS SO FUNNY MORE PLEASEE
So when is Cody coming back?
i loved the girl in the jean jacket
jalien is beautiful i want her so bad
saying someone isn't attractive _to you_ is different than saying someone isn't attractive. that guy is one to talk.
codyyyy
This is epic
😂
the first girl annoying asl
this episode was NUTS
This was totally Cody’s plan from the start
I wish I had Austin’s sense of confidence because fuck man.🧍‍♂️
The ultimate video will be Cody reacting to this later
no fucking way he did it
i hate austin
this is the best episode yet
last two wanted to bone bruh
Has Joji done the button yet?
5'8, how tall is that?
I genuinely don't understand how people push the button before and after it's lit up. Like dude you have eyes fuckin use em
Am I the only one who really likes jai
this episode is too good lmao, it felt like i was part of the video 😂
NO. FRICKEN. WAY.
Rigged haha
That last girl was trying so hard to be quirky.
The last girl was trying way too hard to be quirkt
This is the funniest episode of the button I've ever seen ong
great! now the juicer...
Austim makes me wanna crawl under a rock
Oi they brought in some of the old stars!
Cody is the goat!
I love how there was so much chaos with the last girl that even Jexze (is that really how it’s spelled? because I thought he was joking) was laughing and covering his face with his hands like “what is happening right now” lmao. They are perfect together. It was cute how he said her voice calms him down.
CODYYYYYY
I need the last two to have a talk show together where they just talk about random shit
FINALLY! I’ve been waiting for this moment 😭😂🫡
Please make a reality show of Jesse and the last girl (I didn't hear her name)
More Cody!!!
This is brutal
Austin was so gross and a perfect example of why women nowadays hate dating
When the girl at 10 minutes got Austin out I screamed "yes!" That guy was an ass. Hope that was just the day/editing or something.
This needs to be a regular thing
Thats my girl Lychee 🥹
Please more cody on the button, this was the funniest shit ever
Make this a permanent thing!
With all due respect, I’ve never actually watched a CUT video because I only rely on Cody’s‘ feedback.
Austin, what a weirdo
They weirdly compliment each other
Oh my god, Austin is what every horror story EX BF sounds like 😅JESUS
“You have really soft hands” 💀💀💀
God Austin is just awful,  just awful
For The pegging one I would have changed my name legally!
God this was the best thing ever
You need a camera in the button room, always.. need to know what you guys say behind the scenes like this.. so much more fun
I was laughing so hard at the girl flirting with the button
at this point i'm convinced Austin is putting on an act because he wants to be Cut's heel in this series.
IT HAPPENEDD OMG
best button video yet
I love the og button; however, Cody was born for this role. 🎉😂
ive been waiting for this one
"How come you're bald" who just asks that 😭
this episode was so fun omg
Jai is kinda annoying 😂
MORE CODY KO PLS
I’ve never laughed so much 💀
We have all been waiting for this moment
I’ve never clicked a video so fast in my entire life
CUT'S BEST EPISODE YET.
when do we get ludwig as the button
More
HIRE HIM FULL TIME!!
MAKE THIS A SERIES WITH CODY PLEAASASSEEEEEE
The best episode yet ;p
“AUSTINNNN” 🤖😈
Watched this for one reason
That was wild. I lost it when Austin went "MmMm BuTtOn"
No freaking way
i hate austin but the way he yelled BUTTOOOONNN was hilarious
I was today years old when I learned that the Button is because you have to "butt-in" the conversation...
More Cody as the Button PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Fuckin love Jai!!!
i love the last girl
austin is the worst
emile🔛🔝
I love emile keep bringing him on tbh
Worlds colliding . The bestttt episode yet
They even put his sing as the outro LETS GOOOOO
11:46 JESSE
15:05 LMAO
Jai is actually such a vibe. I like her
5:04 red flag?? LMAO
bro this whole episode is a trip wtf
This is Cody’s Super Bowl
we need this crossover again or ELSE
LETS GOOOOOO
The first guy was so cute!!!
get him to do more
Austin is incredibly dislikeable, but kind of in an endearing way. It's very strange.
Petition to replace the voice of the button with Cody Ko… or at least someone else that’s funny😅
I love this format it would be great if y’all did this more!
next we need Ludwig so they can start the beef again of stealing from each other
Cody makes the button more fun for the contestants and the viewers!
So happy Jesse ended up with her :)))
I’VE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE!
We need to come full circle and have Cody react to his episode of The Button.
Can you guys please stop bringing that one asshole back 😭 it’s not even funny it’s just straight up misogyny at this point. he’s a freak
THIS IS AMAZING
the funniest episode of all time
I wish we can see Cameron (Nut) on the Button, then i can die peacefully
best button video yet
Yaaaaaaaaaaaas Cody :)
call him more times, so cool
12:47 she talks like she has the power to curse my bloodline and I'm in love
the ultimate collab cody ko subs have been waiting for
GOATED
More Cody ko
this is the crossover i needed thank you
Loved this
A prophecy fulfilled
Xgeszi seems so happy here
This is the best thing to ever happen to Cody. Other than the whole baby thing.
FINALLY
Damn am I the only one that didn’t really fw the vibes of the girl at the end? Not that there’s anything wrong with pegging or expressing what you’re interested in, but something about her delivery was off putting to me. And imagine if the roles were reversed. I feel like people would tear a man apart for requiring anal on engagement night 🤷🏼‍♀️
More Cody as the button
my boy emile got rejected yet AGAIN😭
i’m late but finally!
9:51 this man….🤢
instant classic
My fav duo
This was amazing. Definitely the best button episode
Austin is ….  interesting
I want more of this!!!!
Can’t wait for Ludwig to relapse on this.
Austin makes me so nauseous 🤢
this is the best the button episode, byFARRRR
I NEED a whole series of Cody in that button
This is the best episode ever
I swear I actually busted my gut from this video.
we NEED ludwig to do this next
Yes finally let more youtubers do this its great
This was definitely the best button episode! Loved seeing one of my favorite YouTubers as the button. Hope to see more :)
That dude really gave me insight into how my anxiety comes off to other people. Poor dude got it bad and people think he’s crazy when his heart probably going a mile a minute.
i wish dudes like austin would be called out for their blatant misogyny and gross behaviour by other men.
CODY IN SEATTLE??
Austin is disgusting. No wonder he’s single.
MORE
More cody
Now bring Abs to voice it lmao
I havent cackled this hard at YouTube in a while
the way this confirms they do all of this to fuck w people 😭😭😭😭😭
Not people in the comments thinking Jesse really spells his name with a Z and an X
i think he bout to bop it
Cody missed a prime opportunity to say "you mean, bald-garia"
we’re watching history being made guys
OH MY GOD
cody did such a good job
that first girl sucked dudeeee
Cody isn’t just another react guy, he loves the button
Best episode of the button ever. Cody was cracking me up. So mush respect for that woman who did not slap the stupid out of Austin for what he said. She’s clearly better than that though! Queen shit.
The first girl, Jai, was so great
greatest colab in youtube history
you guys, it finally happened
This is my first time watching the actual button video
THIS WAS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING
❤
Cody is so charming lol
Finally.
i dont think she likes the gym
I’ve been waiting my whole life for this .
They got Bonco for Cody Ko??????? Perfect
THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY
FINALLY
Whats the last girl name with jesse? i dont think they put her introduction properly
Cody needs to be more engaged/trying to make them uncomfortable
This is the BEST
Brunette wasian girl has the same energy as Weyes Blood, they even talk the same
I need the last girl's @, man. Dayum she cute.
9:02 make it stop. Make it stoppp!
10/10
Cody should take over the channel 😅
this is what the people needed
austin would hate me
I loved the last two, I wanna be their friends haha.
"aaaauusttiinn" "butttooonnn" lmfao
the hair comment with the black woman was…. 🤨
😭😭😭😭
Hopefully this means Aba has his chance to cure some SICCCCNESSSS in a future episode 😅 @AbaNPreach
@ 2:32 The little nose touch 💀💀💀
0:56 oml what a introduction 😭😭😭😂😭😭💀💀😭🙏
FrighTened.
Where can i see the video where austin first appeared
i recognize the first guy i saw him like 2-3 times on this channel. could you stop faking your content or??
LMAO I JUST KNOW CODY'S LIFE AMBITIONS WERE FULFILLED WITH THIS ONE
Please have him back on the show
Hahahahahah love it
Best episode ever
Mmmmm buttonnn
Does anybody know emile's handle,, tiktok or sumn
S Tier Button Vid ❤️
This was genius
That last girls was batshit insane. I have never seen someone embrace their craziness like that. like totally unhinged.
best button episode
The crossover we’ve all been waiting for
DO YOU LIKE THE GYM WAS SO OUT OF POCKET 😂😂😂
This has to be one of the funniest episodes of the button 💀
this is your best move, CUT.
Fuck YESSSS!!!! Cody my boy ate down
ABSOLUTE BANGER
The pure joy on Cody's face, he's been waiting so long for this moment
Last girl seemed like a walking red flag
do you like the gym 🤣🤣
i love that girl serena ? shes so fucking funny so relatable i could never date anyone with the same name as a family member
this is the best thing to ever happen to the button
Austin was really trying to sound smart saying "diversitle"
We’ve come full circle
can that austen guy be even more annoying and the worst
YouTube history right here
I’ve never seen Cody so happy. It’s giving lil boy watching Spider-Man for the first time
he’s lying about the z and the x right
I think I speak for everyone when I say the pegging girl is hot as fuck
Only here because of Cody! I always just watch on his channel but lemme tell you, I have never laughed so hard at one of these!
this was the perfect person to do this
Lovee codoko!!! He should host more!!❤
Best episode yet lmao. Also if u see this rhino, I love you, even more than I do Noah
Cody looking real old here
she dont work out.
This is beyond epic! Finally!! I’m glad he did multiple ones too ❤
Whoever casted that episode thank you!! Y’all put all of the funniest guys in one video and I thank y’all for it!! Y’all got Emile, Austin, Jessie, and Banko all in one video!! Ngl I would just like to them to all have a conversation with eachother.
i loved the first girl
it feels like you did this for me
this was literally so funny
I'm absolutely in love with the black woman dissing on short men, just to be rejected and getting told to her face she's unattractive, and her absolutely being upset/livid about it. It's so easy to judge others and be bashful but it's far easier to enjoy the karma that comes at someone like that.
Idk what is it about the last duo but i love them and hope their relationship lasts (very unlikely but one can hope🫣)
jexzxzie is stronger than me i would've been going crazy
Austin is the best person to ever have been on here
Dude I thought I was on Cody’s channel for a sec
I think this would be the closest a human can feel to god
yall stay setting up fat people in this shit. it’s crazzzzy
The most legendary crossover episode
BEST CUT VIDEO EVER!!!!!
We need more Cody doing this
Best episode yet
this is one of the best videos i’ve seen in a while, couldn’t stop laughing!! 😂😂😂 begging for a part 2!!!!!!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏
And they put his new song at the end of the video!!! Definitely gets a like in my book! Love u brotha
I feel like yall should continue to let us see behind the button in future vids
This was too good!!
There's no way they don't know its him oh my god he's so unhinged
I fucking love it
This is what needed to happen
This is too good, more please
It’s come full circle and I can finally rest
Now we need Cody AND Nut to voice together
Less goooo
Best unexpected crossover
Absolute banger I want more
WHAAAAT
About damn time
Love this format.  We need more:  1.  Cody Ko 2.  Guest stars hosting the button  Imagine the potential
Who is that last girl, she's gorgeous!
Thank you for this
This brings me so much joy
Couldn’t stop laughing 😂.  I’d love to see more latina representation though 💃🏻
So, like, Cut should do a series of Buttons voiced by celebrities, YouTube, Hollywood, Twitch, whoever
BEST BUTTON EVER
I feel like Austin is the evil Jesse
How much of a full circle moment is it to not only have cody on the show, but for the guy who won was the man cody ALSO interviewed…AND WE HAD AUSTIN SLANDER???? this might be the perfect button video to ever exist
Cody is too genuine for this. The people who participate in the button seem egocentric & annoying.
BRING JEZXE ON AGAIN
BRING JESSE AGAIN
FINALLY!!! our man made it.
OMG CODY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSS BOY
commenting so they see they NEED cody ko agaim
this is def the best episode of the button and you guys need to collab with cody ko on this again, I had laugh so much during this video and it makes me happy, keep it up
Huge W to the cut, amazing episode
Aww yesss!!! I was waiting for this to happen ❤️❤️❤️
that’s so suite life of cut & cody 🫶🏼
This was by far my favorite episode of this show
WE NEED MOREEE
Please get the chest tattoo guy back on if Cody does this again
The cringe is insurmountable. I really wish people weren’t so quick to judge one another. It makes it so hard to watch
This is so chaotic i love it 😂
the last couple are cute together 😍 what's their @?
I love the last girl 😭😭😭
worst line of chicks this show has ever seen though
i love cody ko so fucking much
Cosy as the button? Is it already Christmas?❤
i NEED a brittany broski as the button video
This is the best episode of the button of all time
This has to be THE FUNNIEST episode with Cody as the button coordinator. please bring Cody back for more !
Bring him on more 😂
Lesbian version when?
This game show is just a meme at this point
Jesse is not making back
This was amazing you need to have cody do this again!!
The bigger Filipino girl was so cringe, and I say this as an Asian woman. Why are you speaking in ebonics? Just because you're larger doesn't mean you have to automatically be goofy and less feminine with the way you speak to men. Jfc...no wonder you're single. "How old do I look?" - No, don't ever ask this especially if you're going to be offended with an answer. Way to make Asian women look bad.
so poetic that jesxsze won the episode that cody hosted
"Not that" THAT? WTF does THAT mean????
Best episode
need more cody
Austin drives me insane and I don’t find him funny. Sometimes the burns from some of the people are hilarious, but just straight up saying “you’re not attractive” (instead of saying “I’m not attracted to you” or something like that) is just cruel. I’ve had enough of him and really wish they’d stop having him on.
get ludwig in there
His face when he found out it was Austin 😂
the guy with the Hawaiian shirt is annoying ASF
That was a great video. Next button should be Aba n Preach.
The two at the end took me OUT
I love "the button"
I LOVE JAI
I've been waiting for this. Cody and Austin???? this is everything
Not the same as your brother my names spelt with a z and a x. ~Jezxi
i NEED more
yessssss CODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shorty in the black is amazing I want her
😂❤😂❤😂❤
Jesse is fine as hell, she got lucky
the first girl is sooooo funny im obsessed with herrrrrrr
It’s come full circle
The whole "crackhead energy" thing is sooo cringe to me 😭 The girl is hella pretty tho
The girl at the end is so hot
this is the first cut vid that i watched in full and that is only because of Cody.
“Austiiiin!” “….. buttoooon!”
It's almost impressive how unlikeable Austin is omfggggg
Jai is so funny!! 😂😂
Bring Cody back to operate the button often please!!!
Bro Austin's the worrrrrst 😂😂😂
*What's the goth girls name?*
Bro the first girl thought guys choose to be bald 😂
Absolutely incredible button commentary from Cody 😂
Why did I always think he was the button beforehand 😂
FUCKING LOVED IT
Brittany Brosky should get on this as the button!!
Finally fucking happened
9:59 you can hear the producers say "he's the worst" lmfao
now see, my red flag is that I found Emile charming
This old man voicing the button is super funny
how to "BUTT IN"
What Button video was Austin originally in?
I like how they brought all of Cody’s favorite ppl
That last girl got me feeling certain things, her personality is so attractive oml
austin is so unbearable 😭😭😭
NOW WE NEED COOPER
this is the funniest button ep ever. pls have him back on some new eps eventually too
This was the collab I’ve been waiting for! 😍
Literally so obsessed
The most disturbing part of this whole episode is that Bonco reached out to shake with his left hand.
please make this a series
Best button
i dont watch cody much anymore, but i am SO so happy yall were able to work together! i dont know what energy this was, but it was absolutely chaotic and slay enough to get me up and start getting ready for my day :)))
WHATS HER INSTA SHE SO PRETTY OMg (last girl)
This is legendary
WE NEED MORE CODY KO BUTTON
This is the best fuckin thing ever
Austin sold im not gonna lie

Austin is like a huge ick
Austin is awful.
That girl and Jexzie are everything. The energy 😂 Im attracted to both of them.

FINALLYYYYYY
Literally the most pop culturally iconic video ever made. If Cody isn’t brought back to do more, I’m calling the cops
YES THEY GAVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED
Cody’s faces through this KILLED me
BOPIT AT THE END
The Satan bit reminded me of the Tom, Mark and Travis show
I need more background content
FINALLYYYYYYY
Cody you gotta chill man your wife is pregnant, what’s she gunna say when she says horny button Cody
“ Not that” okay with the micro aggression 😻

FINALLYYYYYY
It was only a matter of time until this happened.
love how the girl in black booted austin and started flirting with the button
“yeah that’s cool…for someone who’s into that…”😭😭😭
this is so wholesome i love seeing cody and kurtis get on some of these shows
Oh my gosh!! I love this!!! Hahaha 😂
Austin is feral bro, wth
The adhd energy was so fun
Cody makes this sooooo funny
MORE OF CODY GOD YES
they are not talking after this 😭
I super loved Jai.
Yoooooooooo I've been waiting for this 🤣 Edit: I don't think there could've been more hilarious people for Cody to guest button with.
when he made the button moan lmao not so easy not to be horny behind a talking box
I swear to God if kodi doesn't react to this video imma lose my shit.
This is a moment for history books
ANOTHER YESS SIRRR
This is the best ever
Cody's dream has finally come true.
Cooddyyyyyyyy!!!!
the sadistic look in cody’s eyes while in control of the button is something i wont be forgetting soon
They did it! They actually did it!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR FAR TOO LONG
codys goin fuckin INSANE

Austin sucksss. Love Cody in this—his childlike excitement at making his Button dreams come true is heartwarming 🥹 (also pegging girl is Wife)
the last girl is crazy
I been waiting for this one
I never came here and these type of show arent interesting to me... But I actually watch all video of cody about the button which surprised me (and probably why im here :D ) This is so ggod i love it now i cqnt wait to see hia reaction or his video about this :D
Absolutely LIVING for the first gal. Slayed! 🫰
Not a single button-mimic/screetch from Cody whenever someone got rejected, a shame 😮‍💨
Cody Ko deserves this <3 love your stuff bro
love that i just kept hearing blake laughing it up in the back
WE NEED MORE CODY CUT
BRUH. You done good Cut
Are you joking me right now. I can die happy now
FINALLY!!
They did it!! 😅
love Cut for knowing their audience
The last couple looked like siblings lmao
Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg 😱
this is actually the best day of Cody’s life (aside from the wedding, and impending birth of his child)
BRO! THIS IS EVERYTHING
NO WAYYYY
the fact the pegging girl was SO NERVOUS is kinda adorable... but she's gonna have to give him a MASSIVE box of kittens for when he proposes..... just sayin
This was the best episode of the button, an absolute favorite.  I really laughed so hard at all the interactions lmao
i'm at 9:25 and i can almost 110% say that blonde chick is gonna button AAAUUUUSSSSSTIIINNNNN
*LEGENDARY VIDEO‼️🐐*
Please do this again!
this is legit awesome -  i thought i was on Cody's channel. first time being ON Cut's channel LOL. i love cody ko and this is absolutely amazing lmfao

Omgggggggg
Lol at that last guy.   'I feel like there's something' 'Is it anxiety'  That was legit funny
LETS FREAKING GO
I can’t believe Cody had the button on his show!
That was awesome! Get Cody on again pls!
Beatiful. No notes.
*banging fists on table* MOREMOREMOREMORE
How is Jexzies name spelled?
Omg finally

Cant wait to see him react to himself lmao
Wow
jesse is fuckign AWESOME
I need Cody to react to this
this is so adorable
This is the funniest episode! Do this again.
He finally got on the show as the button, i love his videos not lying when i said i thought it was his since he was on the screen
you know cody is gonna brag about this to ludwig
I love that the video description just says "You're Welcome" Cut knew what we wanted And delivered
The last lady had a really soothing voice ngl
IT HAPPENED FINALLY
This is history
Ok Cody needs to be the button more often hahaha
I dont believe Austin has ever had sex. what a creep.
FINALLYYYYY
NOOOOO WAY
I wanna do this real bad lol
I am soooo happy about this!!!
MMMMBUTTONNN
More Cody!!!
I think it makes it way better watching the dates with the behind the scenes comments
HOW HAVE I NOT SEEM THIS UNTIL NOW
the pain in his eyes when he heard tall for the third time
Shows how if youre pretty, men will stand through everything even going as far as changing their name. 🤣🤣
I clicked so fast
love how they tried to prove a point but Cody went ahead and made the best episode yet
It's funny to hear the people behind the scenes are totally open and honest about Austin just being a total prick lmao pretty sure I hear a "yeah he is the worst"
Well done
jaylieen is gorgeous and has personality
Dude, this was perfect. Best episode of the Button
don’t ever use anyone else ever again to do the voice
The bop it promo
Emile got CUTER!!!!
FINALLY
Now let’s have him react to it
Omg!!! Getting to see Cody host after watching sooo many of his videos is amazing!!! ❤
Jesse with a z and an x
Oh ewwwwwww Austin is the worst
This is by far the best button episode
the moment we've all been waiting for 😁
Bulgarian? More like baldgarian am i right??? /j
YOO
Where’s Ludwig at
He so deserves this
As someone who has followed Cody for YEARS #tmg seeing him actually get to voice the button hes so in his element. Cody needs to find something in this field of like asking people random questions just cause he thought of it.
Goat episode
"boy, how come you're baldt'" lmaoooooo
With the Power of Cody he ended up on this show A WEEK LATER. ❤🎉
“Auusttinnnnn!!!”
sitting behind a phone screen watching this video for the entirety of 15 minutes like 😃😀😄😆
This was the most insane and funniest button ever
Really great collaboration, would love to see you bring in other guests aswell! <3
this is the most legendary episode of the button ever.
cannot stop rewatching this vid, it’s so good
This was probably the funniest button I’ve ever seen!!! Keep bringing Cody back please!!
I'm honestly not even excited bc this is way too long overdue
“It’s spelt with a z and an x”. LMAAO
this had me smiling the entire episode my cheeks hurt 😂
That was everything we could ever ask for 🎉
This is the mash up we needed!!! This is the best video so far! Love kody co vids
The energy between the last too was insane Lmfaoooo. They better genuinely date or I’m gonna scream lmfao
Yesss
Please bring Cody back ! That was the best button video I’ve seen
This is like a Button video, behind the scenes video, and a Cody reaction video ALL IN ONE and I love it
Cody has invaded the button, LET’S GOOOOO
ok, this was a good episode
I know ya'll do it for the engagement, but please stop having Austin on just to be an absolute pig to the girls. It's not fair to them.
Because no one said it please don’t ever have austin on the show again. Ew as fuck
LET'S GO BRO! HUGE W!
omgggg yessss!! <33
i wanna be besties with the first girl
It happend!!
Austin is actually TERRIBLE. He will definitely be on some sort of list one day
FINALLY! Been waiting for this day~
Jesse always seems so anxious and nervous when he's on the Button, but he's completely relaxed on the Lineup videos.
MORE WITH CODY PLEASE
I like getting to see the reactions of the voice behind the button! I'd love to see more episodes like this!
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED‼️‼️‼️‼️
OH MY GOD ITFINALLY HAPPENED
I did not want this to end and I’ve never watched an actual button video- just Cody’s reactions
I Never thought this day would come
I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING! Codyyyy! This is the funniest button ever, I laughed so much omg
Get ludwig doing this!
I never watch this channel but I watch Cody react to the vids and this is by far the best episode ever. Having a comedian changes things. Cody vs the button final bosses.
the way i know for a fact cody recognizes so many people 🙏🙏🙏
BRING HIM BACK
Cody seems so happy doing this, it's so wholesome
do Kurtis next!
legally change your name bro
Austin will be single forever
i’ve waited for years for this video
I kept waiting for Cody to ask Jesse if he would peg her on engagement night tsk tsk
You know how bad I feel sometimes that I'm with a tall handsome man as a 5'2 woman
This is the best episode of the button I've seen so far. Actually laugh out loud funny 🤣
I now love this show because of this video right here.
STOP INVITING AUSTIN FFS
ITS A DREAM COME TRUE OMFG 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I luv Cody he da best
Last girl was deff into astrology ☠️
Go you work out??? Obviously not I mean look at her 🙄
THIS NEEDS RO BE A SERIES
He KNEW what to do for austin
FINALLY
This is the video I’ve been waiting for my whole life
i must see more of these i love cody
WHAT WE’VE ALL WANTED.
Austin is so Seinfeld
Cody is the bests thing to ever happen to The Button. Austin is the worst person to ever be on it.
“when worlds collide”
Austin was sooo mean damn
SHUT UP OMGGGGGGG
Dubs 🎉
What’s the last girl’s (Serena?) @
The internet can end now, all is right with the world
YESSSS
Cody made this so funny
Never again please 👍🏾
the behind the scenes is the best part ever
He's finally voicing the Button! 😢
That last girl might be an actual psychopath 😂
This is the only cut video I’ve ever watched that wasn’t on Cody‘s channel ❤ he totally nailed it. LMAO. Crazy needs to happen again.
I actually didn’t know the button was a voice changer.
Aeeeye it's cody lmao he made it. His dream came true 😂❤
The button is WAY more enjoyable when the button is normal and has a sense of humour - instead of butting in and RUINING a conversation lol
Best cross over
been waiting for this
best collaboration ive ever seen
This prevented me from dropping out of college
This was the best episode 💀
Never clicked on a video so quick in my life
This is so meta
Not Cody actually helping break the ice 😂

Jai is amazing bro 😂😂
MOOOOOORRRRREEEEEEEEE (please x3c)

Finally!!!

After all his videos on the button it’s only right they have him on the show 😂❤
First girl was Incredible
cody really takin over the button is crazy!

i’ve been WAITING FOR THIS ONE
This Collab is actually epic. I’ve seen every single button video, this one is by far the funniest
I nearly died when I saw this notification 😂 FINALLY THE DAY HAS COME
I can't wait for Cody to react to this later.
jesse is so fine
This was so random, and i LOVE IT  This is truly the most ambitious crossover ever
button needs more BTS omg

Cody being the button was the best thing to happen to this series lol
ludwig gotta be the next guest
im out here gigglin' and shit
This is so good istg PLEASE do this again 😂😂😂
I'm glad they reacted to Austin because that guy sucks fr
I don’t like Austin
THIS EPSIODE WAS CRAZY
I’ve watched this like 10 times already. Please bring Cody back
NOT CODY LITERALLY WING MANNING 💀😂😭
We need more of this!!!
This is the most hilarious button yet
"you ever been to court" lmao
Cody was having so much fun!!!😂😂😂❤❤❤
you need to give the reins to whoever's idea it was to bring cody on, this was amazing.
the last girl gave off bad vibes. if she wasn’t decent looking no guy would put up with her
Cody’s the best wingman ever
This is a dreammmmm
Haha oh this is just what we needed!
The only Cut video I’ll watch directly
what we’ve been waiting for!
Can Austin do the button next 😭😂
first girl was funny af
Funniest button episode ever
That third girl definitely rejected the dude bc he got cheated on

FINALLYYYYYYYYYY
YES YES YESSSSSSS LETS GOOOOOOO

those last two are making my bisexual tendencies light up like a siren, maybe Jezxe could be the best person she ever knew so she can replace the trauma her brother Jesse put onto her
Best button episode
This feels wrong to not watch it on codys channel
Legendary.
do i watch this or wait for cody
he did it
So funny seeing behind the scenes. They despise austin lmao
Cut I am begging you to put on some men that are attracted to fat women! I am so sick of watching these beautiful women getting dunked on by the world’s worst men!!
Did Bonko signal that he does coke at 2:31
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED
this video is the avengers endgame for cody ko fans
I see Cody I watch 🤝🏼🤝🏼
wow austin sucks

Can we get one with Ludwig next?

Cody cringe live at that guy funny asf
Cody took so much joy out of bringing up outta pocket shit.  He loved being the button so much 😂
This had to be staged like all of this was too perfect... I want to believe at least Cody Ko wasn't in on it
Oh my God, this is the best button episode ever! Cody is so funny!
dude I hte fat people at dating shows
yesss finally 🎉
austin just never wants to be one-upped omg 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Again pls🔥
I don't think I ever actually watched a cut video that was someone else's commentary on it... it took them putting a commentator to get me to click on it lol
me screaming cody’s name when something crazy happens like he’ll save me from the cringe 😭
MORE
IT HAPPENED
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Oh my god. Its Cody and. Everyone! They heard us, folks.
we letting austin get away with making up "Diversatile" 7:35
H O L Y S H I T

I love how happy Cody is here like he’s so cute how much joy this is brining him!
Thank god for this episode, I can't wait to see Cody react to it
CODY SAID I CANT MAKE IT CRINGE.
finally
this confirms that when the button is being hornny, it's just a crew member 😭
The last girl’s brain is perfection
WHAT THE FUUUUCK THIS IS HILARIOUS
Yaaasss this needs to be permanent
FINALLLYYYYY
Omg Austin is so gross
The moment we have all been waiting for
austin sucks lmaooo please never talk to women ever again
Need to do this again for sure
YES! The crossover  we all wanted!
NO WAYYYYYY
whaT THW ELL OMG
OMFG UESSSSSSS
ya'll should bring Aba & Preach on next
The "not that"  We just gonna ignore that?????????
I COMMENTED THIS ON ONE OF HIS BUTTON VIDEOS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. IM SO HAPPY.  *I know they probably didn’t see my comment but I’m gonna pretend like it was my idea. thanks cody and cut*
Cody being Jesse’s wingman was top tier bromance
Bonko is a W
Cody + the Button hall of fame was such a great way to do this
Damn look at that view count in just 3 days compared to all their other button videos. Cody’s name goes a loooooong way.
best episode so far this one was hilarious
I thought this was on Cody’s channel I’ve never actually watched a cut video  this was great .
YESSS!!!!!!!
Cody Ko: The Menace Unleashed
Best episode by light years 2nd one is not even close
OMG ITS HAPPENING YALL ITS HAPPENING
I want Cody to be in more Cut videos from now on, let's make it happen.
I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
Why is Austin doing his own sound effect for pressing the button 😭
I just wish Jesse would find someone wholesome. He seems like such a genuinely great guy and deserves it.
xtremely common drake fan L
Cody literally made the button popular it’s crazy
The last girl was annoying for some reason
austin was awesome
This was so cringe I love it
No fucking way
I like how she rejected Jesse and Cody just said 'no'
Austin's ego was WILD
Cody fucked that first guy over so hard that’s so funny
the one dude… he’s something that’s for sure
I am losing my mind! Truly over the moon for Cody. This is everything. Him getting some of Austin's toxicity live and Jessie in the chair too. I am LIVING
Seeing the behind the scenes adds so much more to these videos tbh, keep it!!!
I loved so many of the people in this episode
W cut
Austin da goat
So great of yall to bring Cody on!  This truly made my day!
cody ko pshhhh he will never be ballin...HE BE BALLIN
Jesse is what you would get if markiplier was zooted just constantly
YESSSS LMFAOOO I KNEW HE WAS GONNA VOICE THE BUTTON
Living Ludwig’s dream
We need more.
loved this video concept with the behind the scenes clips, was hilarious and gave some new variety to the show!! also austin can go kick rocks lmao what an unimpressive guy
We need behind the scenes from the person voicing the button in every episode. It made it hilarious.
there should be an episode where cody voices the button but we arent told, and then they reveal at the end
Cody need to always voice the button its the only time I've genuinely laughed watching this
Austin sucks 😂
Finally!
I JUST CAME HERE TO SAY YOU SHOULD LET HIM VOICE THE BUTTON AND WOW
First girl was GOOOONE
This is the best thing to ever happen to cut
Having a comedian as The Button Coordinator instead of what I assume was a producer was a genius move and I’d love to see more.
Cody should feel honored to be on one of the best button episodes cause this one was wild lol
CODY AND AUSTIN WAS AN AMAZING IDEA
ok so austin needs to be humbled immediately
Cody is easily the best button va ever ahahaha.
great collab, i dont usually watch button videos, not even the ones on codys channel, but this one i had to watch
the last girl was so pretty :') damn
FINALLLYYYY WHAT WEVE ALL BEEN WAITINH FOR
What is your type? "Someone who's tall." That's it? That's the onlyl box they to check? Wow. I love how, the first time the question came up in this episode, they answered with actual personality traits btw.
best cut vid by far
man I lovvvvve this ep !!!!
YES
Jezxe is going to regret this the night he proposes. lol
his "jesse" is spelled with a z and an x 🤣????
My life is complete
So good 😂
The collab of the ages
Personal trainer walks in on fat girl....this aint gonna go well.
Have you ever been to court? Do you like the gym? lol
we need a drunk the button if that's not a thing yet
This is nuts
This button is so much better holy shit!! Y’all should really hire a comedian like Cody or Nut!!
I knew this was coming I was just waiting for it
best button ep to date
I have been waiting for this moment for a long time. Please Cody with the reaction video ❤
this is my roman empire
how the hell does someone get on this show it seems so fun
NO WAY
This is genius
Best episode yet
Finally a good button episode
This is the funniest button episode ever pls make more with Cody lol
we need more oh my god
I love Cody as the button! 😂😂 he should do it every time lol
i want this to be his new thing…come on!!! i’ll even start watching the button
Cody gets one taste of power and he’s immediately as horny and weird as the normal button 😅
lessgoo
I’m so glad this is happening
HIRE HIM AS THE BUTTON PERMANTELY RIGHT NOW
THIS EPISODE WAS DIABOLICAL💀
Waited a long time for this. Damn it was wholesome.
I've been waiting for this bro
I had to double take for a second, congrats cody!!! You did it!! You ARE the button❤
REAL TIME CODY REACTIONS
Greatest video ever. Hands down. The colab I didn't know I deserved!
Living up to his Sagittarius spirit, throwing himself into a brand new role just for the curiosity & learning experience of it all 🙌🏽
NO WAY
Cody should permanently be the button. And we should always get behind the scenes like this.
You need to always have Cody do this 😂
Did they put something in the drinks this time?
NEED A PART 2! This was great
It FINALLY happened.
That guy in that dumb Hawaiian button up was absolutely horrible and insecure. Ew!
Good move lol
This is EVERYTHING I’ve been waiting for!!
That last woman was SPOT ON will assessment of her date's personalities
austin is the worst
Well done Cody choochoo
I <3 Cody
THIS IS GOLD 😂♡
Austin definitely open to the idea of getting pegged
Absolutely do this again
We've all been waiting for this. Ty
i genuinely screamed when i saw this uploaded.
🤣This might just be my favorite cut video
Oh they KNEW Cody was gonna destroy Austin lol, dude has a bad track record on Cut aaaand continued being an ass this episode lol.  Amazing collab, really hope Cody comes back! Feels weird to watch Cody react to the button live, as the button, on the Cut channel...but, we need more.
austin and the chronically online girl r the worst
OHHHHHHHHHHHH YEEEAAAAHHHHHHH
they need to make this into a weekly or monthly gig
I need Ludwig to react to this asap
this is a dream come true
Honestly a lil disappointed in Cody for not ripping into Austin more but then we got the amazing woman asking him about pegging and rejecting him fast. She’s great.
Cody remembered Austin from the blind phone date video he made a while back
I needed this
The cut team brought all stars for this
I think he should be the official button voice the number one Stan 😂
I love Austin.
it’s spelt with z and an x is the best comeback quote i’ve heard in a while
WE WANT MORE! CODY IS HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE
Top tier button episode thanks you Cut for bringing on the legend Cody
genuinely what is going on in austins head?
This made my morning :)
bruhh i need last girl insta
CODY NEEDS TO DO THIS IN ALL BUTTON EPS PLSSS HE IS HILARIOUS
i hope the best for. the girl looking to peg shes so lovely lmao
JEZXE❤️
this is everything omg
THIS SHIT WAS WILD
We need another Cody on the button! This was the best episode ever omg
This is amazing.  Loving the behind the scenes and Cody killed it.
It finally happened
Finally!!!! 🤣
The girl who sent Austin off is the best hahahah I wanna date her 😂
My body is ready for this Cody x The Button collab
last girl ig plzzzz
Finally, we definitely need more of Cody
more
Austin blew it 😂 9:27 when she said she got backstage passes. Probably got jealous
i love cody
finallyy
go cody!
Omg they did it!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
OMG I JUST SAW THE VIDEO OF CODY KO SAYING I WANNA BE THE BUTTON AND NOW HE IS! Dreams really do come true!!
I just realized with all the button videos I’ve watched, it’s only been on Cody’s channel lmao never even been here before 😅😂
do it again
Cody has been on a winning streak!!! Go Cody man ❤
We love jesszxie
AuSTINN this is the funniest episode I've seen stg
Those two at the end who won, potentially going on to date, is like watching a car crash about happen in slow motion. They are both so chaotic, there is no way it can end well 😂
What
You must immediately draw up a contract to have Cody become a full time employee as the button voice. I'm sorry previous button voice person, I don't make the rules.
By far the funniest button I've watched
HE FINALLY DID IT?!?
this is my favourite thing ever
The moment we have all been waiting for
I NEED A SEASON OF THIIISSS PLSSSS😂😂😂😂😂
Not Cut promoting Cody’s new song!!! ❤🎉
WHAAAAT! Cody you made it!!!
Funniest thing is that Cody is always judging the Button for it's horny questions yet I'm pretty sure this was the horniest the Button has ever been
why is no one talking about how the guy at 13:00 looks exactly like markiplier
Damn that was actually great, I'm happy for Cody ngl
This was fuckin awesome ❤ ❤ please bring him back. I thought it wouldn't be funnier than cody reacting on his channel but this hits 👌
Bro I thought this was on Cody’s channel 😂😂 I just realized it was cut after it ended
"It's spelled with a z and an x"   this is exactly what I was thinking. Jesus she was a fox.
Ja seemed like she was wasted
The most I’ve ever laughed at one or these episodes for sure 😂
First time watching a Button video on Cut's actual page, only because Cody was still right there with us the whole time
i'll never forget when jesse said "it's not good for me to be sober for too long" yet every woman still gives him the greenlight
The best collab does exist now. I want more!!
everyone dude that stepped out had me screaming for the safety of these women  except the dude with the kids. everyone else they brought back are literally insane
FINALLY!! A dream come true! Make this a series, pleaaase!! 🙏
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
do this with ludwig now
We need more Cody button 👋🖲episodes!
I can’t wait to see Cody react to this
I fucking new this would happen!!!!!!
this might be the funniest button video, excellent matchups
No fuckin way
1:45 "Do you like the gym?" 🤔🤨😐😭😭😭
the last time i laughed this hard was the matty f*cking smokes video with noel and cody. please continue this
So good !!! Best one yet
Cody being excited about Austin and Austin's reaction to it 💀
can cody be the button every episode please
Took ya long enough Cut
Holy shit Cody knows exactly how to make the best moments lmaooo. I'm so happy Cut embraces Cody reacting to their content rather than getting pissed off and copyright striking or along those lines
Codyyyyyyyy ❤❤❤❤
Being muscular and wanting to be fit is being "full of themselves" lol ofc the fatty would say that 🤡
I actually loved this, finally someone that matched Jexze’s energy
this is entertainment
You guys should make comedians and youtubers be the button more, this was frictionless gold
This was gold
YAY DO IT AGAIN
Best crossover in human history.
Тоз Ванко там ко прай веее хахахах :D
Can you just hire Cody to do these from now on? He's hilarious
You gotta do this with Abba and Preach too!
OH MY GOD
I couldn't even eat while watching this i almost choked laughing so many times
YO they even brought in Bonko!
THEY DID IT!
FIRE
Amazing! I'd love to see Cody on again!
THE MUSIC PROMO AT THE END YES I LOVE TO SEE IT
OK that was amazing best episode ever but let’s put Austin on the shelf, please. let’s stop giving him money to be horrible. Thank you he gives off very much incellllllllll.
best episode I have seen
Now I want Cody to be the button on every episode
“i had one crawl on me and i was scared and then it made it go away when it crawled on me”
this is amazing, more cody!
I need more of this!!
JESZE😂
This was GOLD
This was the most out of pocket episode yall have ever done and I LOVED IT! 😂 Everything that came out of their mouths was wild! We definitely need more out-spoken people like this!! 👍🏽
Austin came on this show to ruin people😂
Great Colab
Bro's name is Zjessyx
I was laughing out loud this entire video
id love if cody would be a reoccurrent guest. it looks like it made a lot of traction w over 1 mil views!! i never knew how much id enjoy this until now and i need more!!!
Now Cody’s gonna do a reaction to himself
this is as wild as i expected it to be with cody involved
this is it!!! this is the video we needed🙏
The best Button episode of all time 😂
I am CRYING LAUGHING 😂😂😂😂😂 THIS IS PURE GOLD 😂😂😂
The fact that they put a song promo of his latest and greatest adds to part of the best crossover
Uhhhh I need pegging girls number I want to be her best friend
This was so funny and I’m glad they put Cody on here
The energy is good with Jesse 😂
put fabss on here bro
At the end of the day Cody learned one valuable lesson from this experience: don’t judge a book by its cover.
this is so cool!! it’s like a button behind the scenes
Yessss Cody 😍👌🏼
austin literally makes me suicidal 😀
Can't wait to see cody react to his own button video
I hate how much I liked this
this is the most wild episode yet. What the crap did I just watch?
This is the weirdest match I’ve seen on this show
I want more of this
First time watching it on the cut channel 😭
Please bring Cody back for this! 😂
Cody needa be hired full time
This was so hilarious, great content 👍👍 bonus points for plugging his new song
Yessss!!!!!
Can u do the same video but with ludwig
This was my favorite button episode. That was so funny. We need more of the person behind the the button episodes.
Who usually voices the button? How does one apply XD
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
I don’t like this
Why were all the girls in this one dead bro😂 couldn’t get any baddies this time?
Do this again  do this again  do this again
please get cody back for a part 2 i am BEGGING
Hands down the best episode.
I mean, finally!!!!
plot twist. its been cody the whole time
“Short guys are cool though” I felt that. Short kings anthem has empowered me as a short king. 💯💪
im only liking  if you guys do it again
Dude Cody is making these contestants crack up
3:12 i love this bish
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Y  E S
Now in a couple days we will watch cody react to himself

I CANT BELIEVE YALL ACTUALLY GOT CODY ON HAHAHA
This is a match made in heaven 😂😂

This video is the Avengers: Endgame of the Cody Ko Universe😂😭🫶🏻
No fucking way this is awesome
Cody is a legend.
THE crossover 🙏🏼
This was MadAwesome.
10/10 wingman
FINALLY YES OMG
FUNNIEST BUTTON EVER
I've been waiting for this one! Turn it up
He finally did it! I can’t believe they finally let him do it! It’s so beautiful I could cry!!!! The Cody button is unmatched
No but PLEASE do more of these with celebrities 😂
Cody comes on here and made it 100 times better.
This is the most genius thing Cut has ever done.
I want Emile
by far the funniest one yet
This is the best video EVER 😂
FINALLY
Finally, thank you
This was the episode of the decade. Kody was born for this
this was SO FUN!!
This is the pinnacle of guest appearances
This so much more entertaining
we need more of cody on the button
Sooo much funnier getting to see the button controller they should do more cameos or bts
IT WAS ABOUT TIME
hello??? how do you spell jesse with a z and an x
I <3 cody
I didn't know how much i needed this
To be fair, Cody LOVES the button, so he is nice to them, in my opinion. <3
Ah the long awaited collab
Finally finally finally
MOREE CODY!!
can Cody just be the button now like forever
Oh I LOOOOOOVE THIS
This is the most chaotic energy I’ve ever witnessed on the button 😂😂😂😂
Cut has just made history
Worst cast line up ever, they picked all of the unattractive and weird ones for this lol
WE ARE WITNESSING HISTORY, PEOPLE
cody koo
That last duo lowkey had chemistry tho…is it just me
I love this. Seeing behind the scenes makes this a lot more fun.
okay i feel like talking to austin would be painful
Why was this actually so much better than the regular episodes lmfao I’m crying
Now they need to do an episode of the button with Ludwig on.
You either die laughing at the button,  or live long enough to see yourself become it.
This video is an incredible, off-the-rails experience. But, it never ceases to amaze me how Austin is routinely the villian in every video he does!
We need to talk abt Austin, WHAT IS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND????
So did the contestants know that Cody was the button? Did he step out at the end and surprise everybody?  I NEED TO KNOW
THIS IS SO GOOD
Austin is the MAN
AYEEE
Jesse was nervous af it was cuute
already know cody will mock the regular button in this episode
That was amazing HAHAHAHA
Holy shit no way
Cody made this a god damn jaw workout from how much I laughed
Took you long enough
YES ON MY GOD IM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. IVE BARELY STARTED OT AND IM SCREAMING 😭😭😭
why do morbidly obese women think they’re a 10
CODY NEEDS TO HOST THIS SHOW MORE OMG
11:18 How’s your pregnant wife doing? This is weird behavior. Ick.
Why were they making fun of Austyn like he can’t watch this later 😭
Austin's so wack man that first lady with the green stripe hair was so attractive, she was so beautiful and had to most lovely voice
austin is just a walking embrassment
I know Cody had the time of his life
7:15 is so fucking funny 😭😭😭😭 so is 7:11 with the realization SGSJDHSHFHDHF
This is what i needed today.
OMG this was so awesome
Wooow Cody did his boy Emile so dirty lolll
dude cody KILLED this
i don’t think i’ve laughed this hard at a video in a long time
THE COLLAB WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR SO LONGGG
OMG finally! <3
Austin is..
dude the way cody was having the most fun ever hahaha
this is CRAAAAZYY OMG
BEEN WAITINF FOR THIS
This was amazing
crossover episodeeee😮
CODDYDYDYDYDYDY
finally.
omg! this was so hilarious & love they shouted out cody's new single tht came out
Yessss, have more of Cody as the Button <3
7:15 that was the funniest thing ever
Cody should do a video reacting to this with the winning couple that would be so funny
guy in the hawaiian shirt was genuinely so annoying
Bro respect to cut for not only having Cody on, but being really nice and also promoting his song at the end. Actual class
Dude that last girl… insane
👋🏼🖲️
THEY DID IT!!! THEY FINALLY DID IT!!!
This is one of the best things to ever happen on YouTube.
It’s so nice that you guys plugged his songgg
austin is actually so nasty
the peg girl is so chronically online it hurts.
Cody Cody cody
Best cut video ever made
We’ve been waiting for this
One of the best button episodes!
the collab we were ALL waiting for
I love how they compiled all of the final bosses of Cody's Button journey.
who does this "cody ko" guy think he is
This was the fucking best. I love all of Cody’s videos, so through him I also love Cut and stuff like Jubilee. But having him BE the button was unreal. And seeing behind the scenes?? Fuck that’s sick. I love knowing that the people running stuff are reacting pretty much like Cody in his videos, when they make the show. This was a cool ass episode for sure. Also how the hell you spell Jessie with an X???? Lying ass bitch 😂
no wayy
I need Austin to go to therapy
Austin is pretty unlikable ngl
Finally! Woo!!
i love austin
this was so fucking funny please do this again
I always wanted this to happen
Cant wait to watch Cody react to this one
CODY SAID HE DIDINT KNOW HOW TO BUTT IN.  BUTT IN. BUTTIN. BUTTON.
Now I’m waiting for the video of Cody reacting to his episode of The Button
Christmas came early
First Lady needs to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em…
🤣🤣🤣
i loved it, cody should do this more often and/or I want to always see the person behind the button
literally gasped
all of my dreams are true
please bring him back!!
I would LOVE to see @Ashley Gavin or @missfenderr be the button for an episode!
Now bring Ludwig on lol
This is a HISTORICAL moment this is HISTORY. You guys.
Have Aba and Preach do it
This is the only time I've ever watched the Button on Cut's actual channel lmao
Austin was on the search your phone episode
Best episode I've ever watched
Dreams DO come true.
This bout to be Cut’s biggest video they’ve ever done
When I saw this was for real a Cody take over I made the Chris Pratt surprised face.
Emil is backkk!
The crossover everyone asked for and needed.
best button video by far
Finally.
I kept yelling “DESTROY HIM” 😭
This is the best crossover
The only cut video I’ll ever hit the like button for
no fucking way
bro??? AUSTIN?????? put that man in a mental hospital
Best one yet!
YEEEEESSSS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
the first girl is so hilarious i love her energy
omfgggggggggggggg

We need more of these 😅
Big ups on jexxy on that match
This is the best haha Cody I’m so glad you got to do this. It’s hilarious
they don’t know he’s the button right
i’ve been waiting for this one
They plugged his song at the end 🥺
literally why does austin keep getting invited on? he's by FAR my least favorite person on this show.
this is the best collab on the entirety of youtube
Get Ludwig to be the button next!!
I’ve been waiting for this video
The episode we've all been waiting for!!
AAAAA CHODE
it finallyy happened
codys new youtube gig epic lol
Dude screw Austin LOL
this video is literally perfect, please do this agaaain
this is fucking gold
nice move button😂
About time! LET'S GO!
holy shit no fucking way
Bring Cody back I love this
"Do you like the gym" 😂
CODY YAY IV BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOKENT
the only thing this episode was missing was Farhyn
Cody shouting AUSTINNNNN in the button’s voice made me cackle oh my god
WHATTTTT
The people are being all cheesed up and fake cause cody is there
7:12 IM CRYINNGNGGGG I CANT BREATHEEEEE
It finally happened and they did not disappoint. It was great.
I was expecting more ngl:,(
HOLY SHIT FINALLY
TOOK LOMG ENOUHHHGGHHH
FINALLY
I’m so proud of you Cody. You made it buddy!
Austin is still such a massively misogynistic asshole. I wish Cody had called him out a bit more 😂
Ugh i llove Cody
They put his music at the end? Sweet
Omggg I'm so excited for cody. 😂😂
IM SO NERVOUS FOR CODY THIS IS SO PARASOCIAL
he was happy
It was only a matter of time before Cody got introduced to the Cut team, I’m so glad the collab finally happened ❤
It’s so nice that they let a random a fan be the button for an episode!
This was absolutely hilarious, cody was asking all the right questions lmao
Ally he favs and worst in one episode lol Jesse, Emiliano , Austin 🤢
the only thing that could've made this better is somehow booking nut
Please have Cody back! This is my favorite episode so far!
have never laughed so hard at one of your guys videos please do this again
bro jai is funny as hell
“Boy how come you’re bald?” 💀
Austin is such a smooth criminal rejecting whoever he likes then the pretty girl shows up and he fucking destroys the button.
“figure out how to BUTT IN”… and it’s called BUTTON…. wow
This is actually my favourite thing I've watched all month  I mean September, btw. It's Oct. 1 now so that would be pretty mean if I meant October 😂
CODY KO ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉

austin is unbearable why do you still call him
this is the most unhinged button ever🤣🤣
THE CODY KO SUPREMACY REIGNS ON
bring noel
Jesus christ you NEED to start adding bts clips with the person narrating in future videos, cody is the absolute best but I promise it'll add so much with just your regular staff, hearing you roast them is hilarious
This is the best episode of the button yet please have him back
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen in such a long time!! I love Cody haha
Been waiting for this.
THIS THE END WAS SO WHOLESOME WITH HIM APOLOGIZING AND YALL PROMOTING HIM. I LOVE
OMG IT FINALLY HAPPENED
The last guy was the opposite of crackhead energy dude was zen lmao
OKAY I LOVE THIS WE NEWD MORE OF KODY AND SIDE BY SIDE CREW FOOTAGE TOO

so uhhhh how do I sign up to be on the show?
this was bound to happen
The first time a cut video come up on my feed and it’s literally abt Cody ko. I was introduced to this channel by Cody
Jesse finally met his match
FINALLY
Do this with Ludwig next lmaoooo
Austin is such a douche and has zero game. Watch out ladies
I love seeing Cody's biases come through XD
I can’t believe Cody didn’t say that bald Bulgarian guy was BALDgarian….
Never talk to a guy named Austin that wears Hawaiian shirts 😂
Im here for it. Kody getting put in his place. thinking its soooo easy to do a button video. psh that guy.
W
FINALLY
Finally!
the first girl jai is so fucking funny 😂 NO FILTER but a FUN FRIEND
That was honestly epic lol
NO FUCKING WAY LMFAOAOO
WWWWW
No fuckinnnnn way!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so fucken happy for him
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.
Jai was annoying.
The Bulgarian guy looks like he does steroids.
Cody can't say "I hate this guy" when he's backstage but you know he wants to
This is one of the best colabs in youtube history
quite literally the BEST button episode
this was fucking HILARIOUS 😂
That girl rejecting Austin felt SO GOOD 😹 his ass looks like a backyard again but he’s acting as if he’s hot shit
i’m so happy for cody!
HE DID IT DUDE OH MY GODDD lmaooo
can cut hire cody? pls
Now Cody needs to react to this one 😂
cut with the cody ko promo at the end i love it
Austin is the most insufferable person every episode and I know Cody has been WAITING for him
How cute the song promo ❤
No way they finally made this work
KINGGGGGG
oh this is amazing
FINALLY OH MY GOD
Love watching Cody goof on the button, and watching him goof ON the button is even better. Love the bts, definitely enriches my perspective of the role of the host and adds something extra to the show now.
ew Austin is trash
Any other Brits just not understanding the hype over this Cody guy..? He literally added nothing, he just laughed
I DEMAND ANOTHER ONE. But with Noel Miller and CODY
That guy saying she’s not physically attractive … ew like just say she’s not your type …
Is there going to be a single, attractive woman in this episode?
We need more of Cody and Cut! 😂🔥🙌🏽
austin reeks of SDE...
what does mean to peg someone😭
This was easily the most entertaining button I've ever watched. I usually see them through Cody's channel. He's a great cringe filter for the show lmao
It'd be awesome to see the person who does the button on every episode, it's a lot more fun imo, great job from cody with some crazy contestants
YES FINALLY YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Awwww the promo for his music at the end❤ the button x Cody ko 4eva❤❤❤
NO WAY
bro i cannot STAND austin 😭there’s a reason he has to keep coming back
plz do this again
i’m so fucking glad they put austin on cody’s episode😭😭
What we’ve all been waiting for ❤
I wish Cody could always voice the button
This is so exciting OMG
BIG W
YES!!!
Bro I can not imagine Austin ever scoring a date in his entire life 😂😂
this is the first time im watching a cut video myself instead of through cody lmao
This is..... the absolute best episode everrrrr
e
The most awkward button yet
Love Cody! Get FILM COOPER ON HERE NEXT!!
the best collab in history!
WEVW BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEEEEEEEE
This was the funniest Cut video ever. I would love to see Cody back again. Also the two at the end match eachother's vibe in a very odd fascinating way LOL!
It was the only natural resolution to this.
last girl so bad
Austin is definitely in the closet
FUCK YEAHHH
FINALLY
"do you like the gym?"  *slams the button*
Omg I can’t believe he really this. 😂
CODYS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS LMAO
THE FIRST GIRLS SO FUNNY.
I always thoughts the box was a living thing
Best episode by far! Bring Cody back for sure.
Okayyy with the Bop It outro we stannnnn
Feel free to bring Cody back any fucking time omg this was great
FINALLY!!!!
Wtf was that ending
YOOO
So good
im so glad this has finally happened, i couldnt click on this video any quicker
let reactions for others
THIS IS HISTORY
THE EPISODE WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
Real question is when is cody gonna react to this
This only proves how unfunny the people at Cut are.
THIS WAS SO FUN!!!! y'all should make this a series
cody’s finally done it, he achieved the goal of a lifetime, nothing will ever top this momentous occasion
about ducking time
10:30 he’s thinking about it
Giving the ppl what they want 👏😍
That was a fever dream
Historic
THIS IS ALL I NEEDED ❤❤❤😂 Cody this is PERFECT ❤
Does anyone know the girl at the end’s instagram? I think I fell in love
I had never heard the BUTTON laugh 😆
Whoever decorated that room that Cody is in either needs to be my bestie or husband bc I also have tigers all over my walls. 😍 🐯
Austin is disgusting, referring to that girl as a “That” 🙄 bro looks hella bland & basic
the “austin” and then “button” made me cackle
CUT...can you do dating in other countries, because I want to see just how FU*KED UP it is in other Countries. This is why my pet is my bestie and my ride AND everything...I just can not.
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
Please make this a regular thing
This is the funniest cut video I’ve ever seen
W episode
YEESSS, FINALLY CODY IN THE BUTTON!!
Best collab ever
yessssss
i jus know that girl went w jesse to get addy then left 💀
Wow this lady is crazy... in a good way
HE'LL YEAH CODY KO
no fucking way it actually happened
W CODY 🎉
Hands down best button episode. he needs to do it again.
nah all these people were weird except cody
This will be your most watched episode, for sure 💯 We've all been dying to hear how he would let these dates play out ▶️🤣🔥
I swear, Banko is not Bulgarian xd. This is not a Bulgarian name and every time he is on here he makes up some random shit about Bulgaria that is completely false, like that in our culture all males are usually bald xddddddddd.
The best episode of the button I’ve ever seen.
I BEEN waiting on this
OMG THEY FINALLY DID IT!!!
how’d they manage to bring back like everyone so many familiar faces
WWWWWWWWWW codybro
WHAT KIND OF MEN WERE THEY PICKING FOR THIS VIDEO OMG
This was so funny
im in luv with Emile
Jesse broke character towards the end there
Cody should be the button from now on 😤
Jalien is so weird /: why she on everyone ass about everything after she actually broke the button last video she was in
Cody should be the button from now on
THE WAY I CLICKED
AHHHHHHH
THIS EPISODE IS SO GREAT AND LMFAO SHE SAID ENGAGEMENT NIGHT NOT WEDDING NIGHT this girl is WILD I’m so here for it
I absolutely love that Celina (correct me if I heard bad her name), was the one that the douchebag wanted (he getting nervous and bumping the button is sign of that), and he was rejected and his little ego being crushed by her wish to peg.
the girl at the end was SOO CUTE wth
9:55 AHHHH I love the producers calling Austin out and saying he's the worst 😂
I’ve never seen the contestants laugh so much at the button
Emil ! That was the heelies guy!!
finally
This was literally the best episode ever I love y’all and Cody so much pls have him on forever 😭😭😭
YES SHDJFJVKKS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN
She said the guy had too many Stem Cells lmao
LMAOOOO HIRE HIM AS THE NEW BUTTON VOICE
peak
bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Austin gives insecure jerk with small pee pee complex 😢
Girl in the black dress needs a therapist
Please do another episode like this!!!!
I didn't want this video to endddddd:)))))))
OH MY GOF
11:49 spectacular
OMG OMG OMG OMG
Petition to have Cody be the host decry episode
this is the funniest button video yet!! I swear I never see the people actually laugh out loud like that
These ppl are weird
Austin seems like a shitty guy but the "BUTTON" made me lose my shit
Oh my gosh you need him to do the button every time!!!! Freaking hilarious for the people and the show.
Have Cody on again! I’m sure everyone agrees with me that he should be a recurring guest host!
The ONLY actual Cut video I've watched in its entirety.
Cody’s face when Austin comes on 💀
ah
The prophecy has rung true cody has fulfilled his destiny
EMILE AND CODY
11:35 CODY YOU ARE MARRIED 😭
Omg finally, honestly now i always wanna see the button with the button room included
oh what an episode! this was actually extremely funny
Do y'all pay Austin to be this insufferable?
"it's spelled with a z and an x" lmao
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED
Oh god this was so good 😭
NO WAY.
LOVE ITTTTTTNJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
Hollyyyyyyyyyyy
CODY IS SO FUNNY OH MY GOD
I never thought about the fact that the producers are laughing at the people playing 😭
The day.... finally came.
Crossover of the century
YEAHHH BABYYY THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT
Ik this was coming
Cody has many jobs as a single father, this one is my favorite 😂😂😂
I really needed this episode 😭😭
Next collab should be with Aba and Preach
😂😂😂 never laughed so hard watching the button until now
Omg please let Cody be the button forever
Smartest decision cut EVER made
oh. my. god/vpos
Do aba next😂
It’s amazing seeing Cody’s dreams come true like this lmfao
FINALLY!
no bc i need cody to do this for now on. will yall pls hire him?! at least just until the baby comes. he could probably use the $22 an hour too! 😌🤣❤️
Now bring on Aba and Preach 😂😂
FINALLY
this cody guys a menace
……YyyYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSS
NO WAY
I love that Cody got to host the show and actually experience what having a douche bag like austin there in real time.
He did it. he finally did it.
We have come full circle, Cody is now the button ❤😂
FINALLYYYYY🎉🎉🎉
It's finally happened!! Congrats Cody, you've made it!!! 🎉✨
I NEED MORE
i need cody to react to this. 😂
I can’t believe this is happening right now 😭😭😭
Best decision Cut made bringing Cody on
Do you like the gym? is a violation
this is the best crossover episode
Love this
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This is probably going to be the only button episode I'll watch on official channel.
Why did I scream when I saw Jesse ? they brought out the big guns for Cody. This was the best episode. Y'all can stop now, there's no topping this
hands down best button episode
The way Cody is reacting to this live made my daaaay
this is the best episode of the button ever omfg i need more
FINALLY
This is great
NOW DO IT AGAINNNN
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES
7:18 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
His face at the end when he got rejected 🥺
I need a another one where Cody can ask those insane questions he says in his reactions
Im sorry but why is nobody commenting about WACKADOODLE AUSTIN
no freeecking way
"diversatile" - austin 7:37
I dont think i have ever smiled through a whole YouTube video before now
Jesse coming back is what I needed
Funniest episode yet!!
HOW AM I LATE TO THIS PARTY? AHHHHHH OBSESSED🙌🙌🙌
Sheeeeesh
No way … I knew it was coming someday but I did not know when
Cody needs to be the official button or else I riot
I’ve never been happier pressing on a yt video
bring Ludwig next
FINALLYHTTTTTTTYYYYY
IT HAPPENED
The last girl is God, she called Austin bitchy and Jesse psycho, which they surely are
This was literally the funniest episode ever. Cody was amazing, but in the future I reccomend just having him as the button and releasing an extra video with his commentary it adds to the comedy and the vibes but it's also way too busy to easily keep track of.
Austin disgusts me so much that I  went out of my way to link my phone to my TV to say that guy is so gross and didn't deserve to sit in front of these people or cameras I literally  never want to see him again
He’s gonna do a button react to this right??? 😂
Not the button all stars edition lmao
Cody ran into Austin, his biggest nightmare hahaha, this is good
First guy fr asked if she liked the gym💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
YEAH BABY!  That's what we've been waiting for. 🎉
Ok hitting the button on someone just cause of his name is just fucked 😅
kurtis was on bestie picks my bae, deb was on nectar, and now this 😩😩
It’s always fat people that are the most Judgemental…
I am Bulgarian and I have a full head of hair. Boy, how come you're bald?
Cody's lifelong dream FINALLY became reality. Love his chaotic energy🤘
I love this omg!!!!
I can’t believe this BROOOO WHAAATTT THIS IS AMAZING  IVE WATCHED ALL HIS BUTTON VIDEOS AHHHHHH
Sabrina for president. Peg the boys and make them change their names, ICONIC
NO WAY IT FINALLY HAPPENED!  Edit: cant wait to see Cody reacts to Cody on the button.
That was so FUNNY. "OWE"
How is Cody making that noise at 8:08?😩
Finally Jesse can get arrested for illegal schedule A drugs and stop appearing on the channel
that was so amazing omg 😭😭😂💀💀
One of the worst episodes yet..
Awesome
Omg beautiful
That was goated
AUUUUUSSSTTTIIINNNNNNN
11:17 she’s such a freak i love her sm
NO WAY 🤣🤣🤣
i really need someone to show austin what the fuck is up
First girl was very cringy and was trying too hard to be cool…idk something was awkward.
I’ve been waiting for this
Jezxe
Poor Jesse, I really thought he was being kinda misled and then pressured into accommodating to her
Cody and his personality made this video the funniest episode up to date
Dude the girls in this episode were all like Boise Idaho 4s.
They day has come <3
What's with those people???!! This was a really weird bounch of people. At least Cody had fun
Does anyone know who is the last girl? She is stunning.
how the fuck does banko look 2x bigger than he did last time im crying
Please have Ludwig do this
I like Austin, mfin G
This is my favorite thing ever
This is fucking hilarious, easily one of the best episodes, hands down. Cody being on here is just absolutely legendary
dude that shit is brilliant 😂😂😂
we all know someone like that austin dude, i real life cannot stand this guy.
who :(
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Crackhead energy 😂😂😂 priceless.
Amazing video fr. Glad y’all finally collabed
Showing the bts of cody + crew made the comedy of this so much better,,,it was like an in person live comentary WHILE doing it...i havent laughed this hard in a while
Cody you LEGEND
I feel like I'm cheating on Cody watching this on the cut channel first 😂
this was the funniest episode of the button i’m so happy lmao
He should do it more often!
when jesse came on i got so excited.  "how do you spell jesse?" "it's different than your brother.. it's with a z and a s..."
No way they actually fucking did it. The cut is awesome.
the Austin guy was so unhinged and funny (to watch) but I got the ick when he said  "what that mouth do"
Although Cody lowkey pushed this for Jesse honestly I feel like these two were perfect for each other lol jesse was just very nervous lol
That was a good episode. They should do this again
Honestly the best button episode that ever happened.
this is what we were all waiting for and it’s finally here
Loved that , we need more cody in button videos
Thanks CUT for giving me the biggest crush on Jesse by the way
This is my Roman Empire
Austin is really THE WORST
Exceeded every expectation for a Cody Crossover 😭
i <3 cody
FINALLYYYY
why do i want the first guy
So needed this
This made my life so much better
Finally, not just black people
He a leo sun, cap moon, leo asc kkkkkk
I didnt like that he was so rude to her... there is something not right by him, i think he is a narcissist
bro finally made it
plugging Codys music at the end?!! Cut is a real one
This was amazing, we need this as a recurring thing. "Cut" out the middleman and just have Cody be the button every few months
Please do this more often
I'm crying
I love codyyyy bring him back
Cody doing the voice over was awesome🤣
hire him and make the videos 20 minutes THANKS <3
HELL YEA BOYS LET'S GO
Girl didn't button just to get some Adderall
"I dont want a guy who smoke weed" Proceed to eat 6k calories per day
One of the best episodes of all time😂
This is awesome
Dude cody made it to the  button! That's fken sick!
HAHAHAHAH
This was an Avengers level seismic event
this is incredible
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
this was what i never knew i needed, amazing
ohmygod yes
I think I would be great in here
YAYYYYAYAYAYAYAYAYYYYYYYYYY
fuuuuuuuuk dawg.. cant watch this without cody. but damn i wanna. i'm closing this video NOW
The combination of cody as the voice and Jesse AND that one horrible guy whose name I don’t care to remember is the best thing to happen
ima be so fr jesse sounded high asf and she sounded like a queen of a country
austin is insufferable
The last girl is giving the Wednesday vibe.
Putting in my watch later IMMEDIATELY so i can be happy during dinner later
Cody should be the one and only button . This has been the best episode of the button by far .
Finally. FINALLY. FINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
FINALLY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR THIS LEGENDARY VIDEO!
No way
9:53 9:57 - “Sticking with your backstage pass. All access cause you bad. You could go wherever with that ass” - Drake.
This was such an awesome collab to see as a long time fan of Cody. Very wholesome AND great interactions between the people playing the game. Also really sweet that you guys plugged his song.
dub
OMG I LOVE THIS!!! YAY CODY
9:26 that's INSANE???
Well this was great
Oml the whole time I was like “Cody is always so overly confident that he would make the best button yet still he choked as soon as he actually got the opportunity” Lol I’m sorry I still love you tho ❤😂
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I need more of this with Cody ko
OMG ITS FINALLY HAPPENED!! I swear I’m tearing up right now 🥹 🩷🩷🩷 This is a magnificent moment of internet history!
Cody whimper audio!???!??!?
Bring him back
Wtf YouTube how did it take a whole day for this to be recommended to me
Where do they find these people ?
OMG HE FINALLY COLLABORATED
IT FINALLY CAME TO FRUITION
Wasian girl’s mannerisms remind me of Ashley / bestdressed
this gotta be the best ep wth 😭
Love how they still gave Ko a W
so good
YES FINALLY
FINALLY
BEST COLLAB EVER ACTUALLY A 10/10!!! Unironically my favourite video of this year
the moment we've all been waiting for
Please make a part 2 , this was GOLD
FINALLY
Cody was ruthless 🤣🤣
stop i’m 2 minutes and 48 seconds into this video and i’m already upset it’s going to end
watching the button without Cody interjecting between each awkward moment was nearly impossible
Wtf who cares about the name bro that stops u from having a connection w someone? Over a name ?🤣🤣
u need to have him on again this was the funniest and the most interesting episode yet
Finally
This is my roman empire 😭😭
10:25 I volunteer
It's always a good episode when Bonko shows up he's such a character
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
OH MY GOSH THIS IS ALL IVE EVER WANTED
Brooooo does this mean Emilie and Carter didn’t work out😭😭
YAAAAYYYYYY CODYYY
YESSS LET HIM DO IT EVERY TIME‼
i love how they specifically put austin on this
I already knew this epi would be hilarious lol best YouTube vid I’ve seen in a minute!!!
I can’t wait to see Cody’s video reacting to this.
crew was right austin is the worst
Why do they keep bringing Toxic Austin back?! 😷
Amazing
YAYYYYY CODYYY🎉🎉🎉
Thank god
an absolute gem! love Cody’s reaction vids, so an absolute treat to have him be the voice
THIS GOES SO HAAARRRRRDDD AHAHAAA. Man, Y'all gotta have Noel and some other dudes on here.
TOP TIER CUT VID
the amount of fun they behind the scenes is too good
Austin is so unhinged
DO MORE
NO WAY NO WAY NO WAY IT HAPPENED SJOULD I WATCH RHIS ONE OR WATCH THE ONE OF CODY REACTING TO HIMSELF
IM SO HAPPY
THIS WAS WAY TOO GOOD
This is the most insane video I think I’ve ever watched
i fear the day austin makes it to the very end.... may the universe spare any man, woman or non binary person who has to suffer through this show with him
This is the best cut episode to ever be
This episode was unhinged 😂
I kinda wish Cody had said the intro bc I know he knows it by heart
the way i audibly SCREAMED ... i only watch cody kos reactions to yalls show. i love this :))
this made me crack tf up
IT’S FINALLY REAL OMG
I love how they got all of cody’s favorite male characters to appear <3
OH MY GOD FINALLY!!!!
Jesse is so fine plz bring him back to voice the button next time.
OH MY GOD IT HAPPENED
LOVE THE COLLAB
This was the most I’ve laughed in a long time
Can this be the only way they do the show from now on like different big guests every episode like this comment if you agree
whos the last girl?
Austin is insane get him away from society
I think they should get ludwig on this next just bc he’s obviously really obsessed with this show
No way that  won 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂his first episode was so weird
i want cody in every episode LMAO
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER
love that cody ko took over perfect crossover
legendary
I like Cody Ko😂😂😂😂😂
Me and Cody Ko had the same reaction when he said can get you in shape
I'm so different, I'm a psycho who doesn't let others talk.
Emile seemed so nervous
cut I’m begging you we need more of cody voicing the button as soon as possible
Cody looks a little to go in this video. This was so so funny thank you CUT for having him on!
I liked Jesse this second time round. And giving him this second chance makes me see how attractive he is
I HATE AUSTIN OMG
NO WAY
Austin cannot come back
W
Best video ever.
Best collab in the history of collabs
Austin is a constant disappointment. Stop inviting him…
MMMMMBUTTON
Omg and all the memorable people are in this again!! Like the heely guy. They are all back haha😅 great video Cut!
Cody ❤
Legendary collab. Love that you brought out some of the show's legends on Cody's channel too like Bonko, Austin, and Jesse
I hated the last girl trying so hard to come off as different and "crazy 🤪"
Omg this is just amazing
Y😊65😊😊😂is 6
Austin sucks dude.
im so fucking high this is hilarious
YESSS CODY
Omg this was so cool ❤😭 y’all should do this again at some point
This was the best 🤩🤩
Use this like button as a petition to get Ludwig on the show!  ⬇️
best one yettttt
SO FUN
i’ve been waiting for this day my whole life also best cut video ever 🤣😭🤣😭🤣
NAHHH THIS AINT REAL
Now get Ludwig on here :)
Just give Cody the show
them promoting his new song at the end is the sweetest thing ive seen on the internet in a while :)
austin is a loser
YO LETS GOOO
OMG this was so funny !!! best button video by far
Yes this is what we all want. Bring him WEEKLY/MONTHLY PLEASE❤🎉
9:52 I dont like him
aw they really look cute together
They both crackheads. incels gonna be so trigerred by her
Rejecting someone because they have the same name as your brother is despicable😂
I feel like the last girl was more into the button then the guys😳(This was my favorite so far!)
The 2 at the end are so weird i genuinely think they are soulmates lol
This crossover finally happening feels like Christmas morning as a kid
cody secured for jessie and for that we salute him
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
this the best button ep do this again pls
“This is SATAN” part made me CRACK UP💀😂
This episode actually made me laugh😂 Bring Cody back again!
no please hire Cody to be the button
OMG ITS HAPPENING KEEP CALM
FINALLY THIS IS WHAT WEVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
never realized we needed this so much
I can’t wait for this reaction video!
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Please do this again, Cut.
Bruh the last girl was a living paradox. XD poor guy was confused
You guys need to team up with pewdiepie and cinnamon toast Ken next.
omg its so good we need more
That was so fun. Even if we don't get Cody again you should keep the cam behind the scenese
You need ludwig to do this
Getting tired about this "conections". Only work when both are hot
The button seems older in this vid
best button episode to date
This was so iconic
The girl does have a point with the name thing, I don’t think I could go out with someone with my brothers name, maybe my sisters names because like 2 of my sisters names are versatile and I’m into guys, so like if he had the same name as my brother I’d probably go with his middle name or something😂
This was incredible. I’ve BEEN waiting for Cody
We need more!!!!
this was so funny lmao
Get that one incel misogynist out of there, gross calling one woman ugly and the next saying she sucked D to get her tickets, absolutely disgusting. Second: Cody please believe women when they say they don’t want kids, and when the other lady said she didn’t want to date another dude and you gave her 3 more chances and then they won? She said no thanks though…. I bet you would have believed the dude if he said he didn’t want to date a lady
I have never watched in this channel I’m only here because Cody is why I am here
okay i’m sorry but you need to get that last voice actor out now and keep this up this was the funniest episode you have no idea
literally exactly what button needed. more cody pls
iLOVE EVERYTHING
WOOOO
shouldve told them that it was cody voicing the button & get their reaction 😭😭
MORE !!! WE NEED MORE !!!
LOVED THIS
my first time actually watching a cut video on their youtube channel i think
OH MY GOSH IM SCREAMING RN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man, I kind of wished they would've had Cody do his own button voice. That would have been GLORIOUS!!
I feel well fed
ICONIC PLEASE DO MORE WITH CODY
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEE!!!!😂😂😂🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
That last girl 😍
BEST COLLAB EVERRRRRR
3:26 do u think that’s why it’s called the button ?
FINALLY
PLEASE tell me cody stayed for more than just one episode
Absolutely shocking that Austin is still out here on Cut looking for love after all these years with that charm…😳🫣🙄
Cody Ko x The Button is the collab I didn’t know I needed ❤
austin legit scares me
i just knew this day would come
need more of these LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the most iconic collab
Petition for Cody to take over voicing The Button 😂
Cody: "I'm getting used to coordinating and how to butt in..." button?? pun???
That girl with Jean jacket was too much 😂 came of as manic energy
If chest tattoo guy was on this episode, it would’ve completed the assembly of the cut avengers.
Omg it happened
omg
They even advertised his song🥹
Cody Ko but no Aba and Preach?
MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE
I am SATAN, Welcome to HELLLL ! made me laugh way too hard 😂😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/5Rfq_EFypxs?si=6vLNsU0lgjm-yL-E

How can I like this episode more than once?!!
THANKS CUT. WE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS
This might be the best episode!!!! 😂😂
She def rejected him because he got cheated on....
austin clearly got rejected once and now gets off on rejecting women
the way Cody got the excited when he recognized Austin was amazign..this episode is a cinematic masterpiece
I've never clicked a video so fast
of course the winners both have adhd on the cody video
you should have comedians impersonate the button on every episode
I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED AND I LOVE IT ALREADY
Please make this into a regular thing
YES
pls do more with more people
FINALLY
So sweet to put his new song at the end of the vid
oh my god FINALLY
As someone who has no idea who these people were this episode was trash. I feel like the people who like if only liked it because they are biased towards the guest. This wasn’t it.
This was genuinely so painful to watch. Thanks button.
Austin is a fucking gangster 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cody is having the time of his life with this I just know it
i’ve never clicked something faster in my life
This feels like a fourth-wall break
First girl was kinda annoying
IM SO HAPPY HE FINALLY GOT ON THE BUTTON❤
I haven’t watched cut videos without Cody’s commentary in a long while, I see they brought back people he would recognise 😂
I love this so much
Austin again? I mean why do you guys hate women so much ?
OMG LOVEEEEE IT cody looks so happy, you should invite kelsey tooo <3
Funniest CUT EVERRRR!!!!
This is genuinely the best episode of the button I’ve ever seen
This is the crossover we all needed !!!
i'm glad that the people backstage are also reacting to the contestants the way we react too
8:21 - pain
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
that... was... so... good! very funny video wow, the behind the scene cuts were really cool, immersive
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN IT WAS SO FUNNY! it’s almost like a behind the scenes of reactions to these people, which I guess is what Cody does but even hearing the producers laugh was so great, Good job Cody, you recognizing Austin was so funny 😂
please do more with cody
this is the best collab ever
such an amazing video! please bring cody ko back! subscribed 😊
BRING CODY BACK EVERYTIME NOW
get cody on the payroll this a top tier episode 😂😂
austin seems for real like a creepy and unsettling dude to be around
HAHAHA I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Now I want to see Cody's commentary on this button video. :d
The last couple was vibiiiin', maaan! Would be a shame for them not to go on a date just because of a name.
FINALLYYY
FINALLY
Best episode and he must come back
This should be at 1M views! Legendary episode!
we’ve been waiting THANK YOU
Best button episode
PLZ make this a regular addition to the series 😂
This is everything my lil YT watching heart has wanted
This is a dream come true my bro
We LOVE Jezzxy
Austin gives small-dick energy, he insulted/slut shamed a girl for having better tickets from him and he insulted a black woman, calling her not attractive and that, there is a difference between not being attracted to someone and calling them unattractive. I am heterosexual, I am only interested in men that doesn't mean women are unattractive.
YYYEEEEESSS CODY!!!!! FINALLY. I can't believe this is happening!!!!!
NO FUCKING WAYYYYY
whats wrong with the third guy
This needs to be the regular i love Cody💓
ok does cody work for Cut or something?? How does he know that guy
I can see Cody make a reaction video to a video he was in 😂😂
Austin is such a mysogynistic asshole. Automatically assumes the girl had had to blow someone to have gotten backstage passes. He is a walking ICK. Also, him telling the girl "you're not attractive" .... ah you mean, not attractive to you?!?! Him acting like he's the hottest thing that's walked earth. Someone needs to tell him. Ew.
ICONIC
Austin was so 💀
I love Austin and Jesse also I really loved the last girl hahahahaha SHE IS SO CRAZY , I love her, she gives me Aubrey Plaza
I need to have this happen again!! Part 2!
so funny, should do more often
Best episode yall ever made
WE NEEDED THIS
This is my avengers endgame
beautiful crossover! austin needs therapy
10:25 BRING HER BACK
The best episode so far.
The way my jaw is on the ground
I have been waiting for this forever. I’m so happy.
Do it again I don’t care how much you have to pay him
I can’t believe it but he FINALLY made it! 🙌🏼👏🏼 let’s go Cody! Lol
Best episode yet 😹
This is the only cut video I’ve actually watched on their channel. I always just watch Cody ko 😅
omg how is cody gonna react to himself being the button
ABOUT TIME
The last girl was annoying af I’m sorry
First girl was so insecure and weird about it
Finally !!! The universe is whole !
Austin should have been kicked off hes disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
This was one of the most entertaining button videos
This episode was amazing!! 🤩 🎉❤😂so many epic moments! Congrats 🍾
that one guy was a vilian omg
perfect crossover
Oh god this show was insanely freaking good!!! I now hate Austin a little more and why is Jesse just such a sweet, cool person?? His first button show was wach af but damn is that dude a vibe! 😍
This is GOLD 😂
We’ve all been waiting for this moment
I loved the first girl 👏🏻😍
I need someone to roast Austin so bad and put him in his place cause that was painful to watch. What a sexist asshole.
I NEED MOREE
only cut video i will like
Someone find karinas @
The fact that they brought all the classics from Cody Ko’s series makes this even better
You legends.
Best episode ever!
I'm gonna need this crossover more often! haha
This was frictionless.
Jessie looks like he really (like actually) liked her! It’s cute
WELCOME TO HELL 😭😂
I need to see how it works out w the
oh how i’ve waited for this
This is the best episode of cut omg I can’t stop laughing
best collaboration of all time
Wow this is funny, I had no idea that interjecting and asking questions was so hard. Really funny to hear the producers and see the inner workings of the show. Very funny! Its similar in effect to seeing the dating pools like in some of your newer vids, but this is less biased
Been waiting on this for years 😂
IM SO FUCKING HAPPY CODY IS ON HERE
We need more Cody I’m begging 😂😂 this was the best episode by far and the one that audibly had me laughing
NO FUCKING WAY CODY
best video ever Cody ur the best! we need u in every Video!!
Austin is out of pocket 😂 bro got the autism rizz

We’ve been waiting for this!!!

AGAIN
Literally one of the only button episodes I didn’t really find all that cringey.
I AM SO HAPPY
So happy to see this on my feed! Best collab
❤cody
Real time button reactions!!!!!!!! Omg!!!! Cody as the button commentator was so good too
Y'all, if you are appalled by someone's behaviour... you have to call it out. You can't keep allowing that gross misogyny to happen, especially when you have a public audience. Austin was a egotistical, aggressive piece of crap and you all just sat there and gasped and allowed him to grab a woman despite her telling him that he was being aggressive, and then go on to gaslight her because of his fragile ego.
I need more of Cody as the button
8:28 Broke her heart and snatched her soul… praying for them
this was inevitable
I'm sorry but who is Cody?
“Why are you beating the fuck out of the button?”😭😭😭😭
AUSTIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
Jessexz is the protagonist for sure
Not cody here to promote his song😭😭😭
Who else thinks that Jesse has finally found his match?
i love emil, he’s so cute! seen him in a few videos now.
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
OMG I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I <3 Cody ❤😂
This is the best thing I've ever seen.
What's Marina's @?
This is amazing
We’ve been waiting!!!!
THE MOMENT WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR 🎉
IM SO EXCITED
I like deep voice button
this episode is so good with cody! also austin is insufferable lmao
This episode is HILARIOUS
“were you, like, cracked tf out?”
ICONIC
This has made me want to be able to see the person voicing the button’s backstage reactions to all the episodes
https://youtube.com/@MaudieGoes?si=rQe7KcaPGcspNczi
Cody!!!!
Use me as a ‘Make Cody the permanent host’ Button
I need more
This has been like 4 years in the making 😭🥹
FINALLYYY
I’ve been waiting on this one, turn it up
He's bald from steroids... 😂
The AUSSTTTIIINN and BUTTTON KILLED me. This episode is hilarious
This is equivalent to Avengers End Game

This took way too long
FINALLLLYYYYYY
Please do this again
This is a the most entertaining thing ever
FINALLLLLLLYYYYYYY <3<3<3
i would watch more button videos if cody was the button
Petition to hire cody as the button
OK I LOVE THIS MAN SO MUCH
Best cut video ever
I feel like a proud mom! Cody Ko finally got on the button lol
Whoever’s idea it was to put Austin, Banko, and Jesse on the Cody episode needs a raise
The most iconic Cody Ko collab
The crossover we all needed.
Honestly I’d love to see more behind the scenes. I’d love to see the “button” reacting in real time.
YESS
I’ve never seen Cody evil laugh so much in a video, this was a massive W.
I need this to be a regular occurrence
FINALLY
AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!
I just know cody was having too much fun
Amazing video
I feel like I lived to see this video
Finally a button video I can watch

Austin is disgusting, please stop giving him a platform lmao
i would lowkey date jesse ngl his energy is so unique
Omg I wanna be the button
ITS ABOUT TIME !!!!
more button ft cody
Best promo for his upcoming EP ! 👍🏼👍🏼
crazy how austin gets worse and worse every time he’s casted on one of these
thanks for this
this is the best video on the internet
Make him the announcer permanently
that last girl is a freak
More  More  More !!!!!!!!!
I love knowing that every episode the producers are laughing at everybody while it goes on
The pegging guy was so annoying
girl in black dress lives on the internet lmao so cringe
best button episode ever✊🏽
This episode is so funny 😂😂
FINALLY
finally
Cut shouting out Cody’s music at the end!!! That’s so cool!!! 😱✨
Noo fuckin wayyy  LETS GOOOOOOOO 😭
Best episode ever
this is iconic I was not expecting this
Best video you have ever made, cut
This is so good 👍
Best episode ever
Omg love this
Thank you Cut for letting Cody come on. This was hilarious
Can't wait for the dude to come back and tell the story of how she called him by her brother's name while having sex
cody voicing the button should be a permanent feature
my mouth dropped just looking at the thumbnail! dreams come true!
i know he had the time of his life back there
easily the best button
I've never clicked on a video so fast in my life
The greatest collab ever 🔥🔥😆😆
“mmm button”
EMILEEEEEE
ICONIC!
Lmao cody being here was unexpected but was a much needed surprise.
Thank you so much
Austin seems so insecure and mean spirited. + Calling that girl “not physically attractive” when he looks like a creepy frat boy was a choice
This was a gd masterpiece. 😂
Colab of the century
STOPP AUSTIN
OMG YES AWESOME THANK YOU LOVE THIS🤭
This is my Roman empire
WHATTTTT LESSSS GOOOO
Coolest dude on the button
cody needs to do another one of these
I love Cody so much man you need to have him back
the best episode of all time 😂
This is perfection
omg finally i can’t believe it actually happened 😂
Can’t wait for him to react to this
Cody was really playing wingman for his boy Jesse
Austin has some personality issues. He seems to think that first women was questioning him and he didn’t like , assumed that one girl sucks for some backstage passes, and wanted that last girl to peg him.. I think he needs to switch teams 💅
NO FUCKING WAAAAAAY
Austins gotta be a social experiment, cuz theres no way
Best. Idea. Everrrrr
That guy is a sore loser.
CODY HAS FINALLY MADE IT
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Okay but who else didn’t actually realize the button is a person
Definitely my favorite button episode
I HATE Austin so much
Yo that is crazy
I thought this day would never come 🙏
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE !!!
i’m literally in love with the pegging girl
THE BUTTON HAS BEEN CODY ALL ALONG
This one was wild 😂😂😂
His red flag is women who change their hair a lot? He just don’t like black women 😂
this was awesome.
funniest button episode i’ve ever seen - and cody killed it!!!
Omg when worlds collide 😮
Thank god!!!
The button sounds like such a fuckboy
such a perfect video
Austin is TOXIC
NO WAYYYYYYY
He said it takes getting used to knowing how to “Butt In” or one could say how to “Button” get it?
THE SCREAM I SCRUMPT
YES CODY ❤❤❤
Was that the heelys guy?? Also best episode yet. ❤
No Fucking way
this is my favorite button video ever 😭 jesus that one guy was such an asshole
Austin should have his own show
I can die happy now :)
this is exactly what we needed
this is the best thing ever omfg
omg the girl in the black dress is sooooo quirk...omg security arrest her shes reckless shes a danger to the goverment and society. really, reaaly, reaaaally quirk i cant
Omg I loved this get Cody to do this again plz
NO WAY!!!
get ludwig in here
You like the gym? 😂
9:26 PARDON ME WTF?
We need kai cenat to do this😂
This was gold. From Cody to the cast.
CODY AND I MADE THE SAME FACE THAT "yeah id get you in shape"
Absolutely not, whoever this Cody guy is was funny asf but I CANNOT get over how fuckinnn disgusting and rude the Austin guy was. He just degraded that blonde girl then booted her off, then the Audacity to say to the other girl “your just not physically attractive” and continue to say rude shit about her. I was having a really hard time finishing the episode because I was SO scared he was going to say more rude things. What a complete ASSHAT
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES I BEG YOU GUYS 😭😭😭 i’ll do anythingjsheehskdvdve THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAV CUT VIDEOS OF ALL TIME
OMGGG
This is so iconic!
bro what is austin on ???
finally
Idk why this stood out to me but the first girl and ej shook with their left hand
Austin definitely has Aspergers.
happy to see this on #3 trending, a collaboration  that we have all been waiting for!!
I can see this becoming a thing now.... guest "hosts" with the button.
FINALLY
FINALLY
CODY IS TAKING THE HOMIE WHO RUNS THE BUTTON FOR SURE
I loved the first girl 😭
Cody being happy to see Austin is hilarious
Bring Cody more!!
I want Cody to react to this video so bad as well
NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
can we make this a regular thing? 😂
best video so far
FUCKING FINALLY
IM SO FUCKING EXCITED TO WATCH THIS
THEY BROUGHT BANKO BACK?!
I love knowing the lore of every person because of cody’s videos
Stereotypical black women with a wig!  I'm surprised she doesn't have half of it glued to her forehead!  Austin was a fucking savage!  MVP of The Buttom!  He didn't feel one-uped by her!  She was like 45 and broken!  The last chick is a prime example why these women are evil.  Over a fucking name?  She'll be single for life or savagely cheating and pegging her guy.
Best collab
That man in the Hawaiian shirt is feral
This is the best video I have seen in SUCH a long time 😂
THEY DID IT HELL YES
Thanks Cut, for making this episode finally HAPPENNN!!
Girls are saying somebody tall because they have been brainwashed by social media
There’s a big difference between “you’re not attractive” and “I’m not attracted to you.” — But Austin does a good enough job demonstrating he’s a jerk without me explaining why
best ep so far!!
My Roman Empire!!!
Austin is awful, i feel like ive seen him one or two times before.
THE collab
He should host this show regularly
Brooooooo
now make that a series
“Can you moan again?” “Me??” “No not you 😭😭”
Personal trainer seems like more of a nachos guy.  Nose nachos
They brought back all the classic characters this is amazing
Austin is a trip
Yessss both Cody and I I have been waiting for this moment YES
Give a man a little power and watch him turn into a dictator
Finally
Let’s go
O
HIS DREAM HAS COME TRUE
Austin needs a reality check
Cody??? up ASTRONOMICALLY ✨️
W Cody content
Best button ever
‘… have you ever been to court? 🙃’
https://youtube.com/shorts/NkizEzQi-Zc?feature=shared

YEEEEEESSSSS THE MOMENT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR

Austin never fails to be the biggest douche on the planet lmao.

LETS…FCKING..GO!!! FINALLY!!!
Jai is funny afff hahahahahaha
That “austtinnnnn” “butttonnnn” moment was one of the pinnacles of Cody’s youtube career 😭😭
They brought all the big hitters out for this one

the funniest episode of the button EASILY
amazing lmao
This episode was so funny it made my week.
Cut realized that Cody is the best part of their Button content, so they had to bring him in house
OH MY GOD THE SPEED AT WHICH I CLICKED THIS. CODY IS LIVING HIS DREAM.
CODY IM SO PROUD OF YOU KIDDDD
Best episode ever
Austin is such a dickhead i like that they keep bringing him back for a new round of humiliations
CODYYYY

Fantastic!! 🎉 so happy to see this come to fruition! Keep these going😂
I LOVE JAI 🩷🩷🩷
You should make this a series where different creators host the button
we don’t care about dumb youtube celebrities, stop putting them on here
Finally
I have the biggest crush on Marina, she’s so fucking hot. I saw Cody restraining himself from getting into some role play
❤❤
Oh no, it didn't work out between Emile and Carter :(
Loved this. But Cody was a terrible button 😂
1. Cody needs to franchise the button and keep doing it  2. Austin should be banned lol
If you had a different name I wouldn’t have rejected you.   Women ladies and gentlemen
YESSS I am so excited to watch this
i despise austin
I swear man, Cody’s gotta be one of the chillest persons on earth  I’m convinced he’d vibe with anyone!
So cut is the one that let him have fun 🧐
OMG
If we can’t get Cody back then please can we have a button cam every episode
Cody saying it’s hard learning how to butt in with the button, smooth
last girl was a problem
austin was so mean 😭😭
Finally
seeing cody get interviewed in the end really reminds me of the time they interviewed cody on television as an app designer lol
That’s sooooo exciting ngl
This was a hard watch ngl😭
Legend says Cody Ko is the real button voice
BRING👏HIM (CODY)👏BACK 👏
Na this is wild 😂😂😂 Kody? I haven't watched this but bro am i excited
diversitile
funniest episode ever XD
Top tier button episode
That girl was so funny
This combo is way too good
Cody ko!!!!!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
omg
I always thought the Button was an AI robot... now I'm finding out it's controlled by a person... everything I know is a lie and all these Cody Ko videos won't hit the same way.
Finally!!!!
I smiled throughout this whole video 😂
Cody needs to release a reaction to this button video with Cody! 😮
the best collaboration of 2023
Oh man. Please bring cody back. that was HILARIOUS

This was a power move. In the best way.
Ok what in the FUCK was this episode
I saw cody ko, and I clicked SO FAST
This was soooo funny!!! Please bring him back!
This was SO entertaining😂
Dude I need to hug that girl that he called ugly to her face with no regrets that made me sad when she walked away Jesus Christ man
Bro really dissed her for backstage passes, got a bruised ego AND hit the button after. The fuck is this guy
i need more of this!
This is just cody's world and we're all living in it
Okay, you guys got Cody on, I think the obvious next step here is Ludwig
WEVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS MOMENT
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OMGGGGG
This was definitely the best episode so far. I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the end. Please, bring Cody another time 🙏
I like that she called Austin bitchy and crass.
GOD i love jesse, banko, AND this brunette lady
Austin’s opinion are going to leave him to getting pegged and pegged only.
This episode just makes me realize how much of a crack it must be for the whole crew controlling the button
Aye Cody ko❤
The psycho shows good looks can get the date...surprised he didnt buzz this one
I can't wait for that Cody guy to react to this
Austin is gross.
I never really liked Codys own videos, but that was sick!
HE FINALLY DID IT 🥳🥳❤

These producers are merciless. Giving Banko to plus size girl.
Yes yes yes yes
i need more of this rn
WHAT A EPISODE, loved this man
this lineup is crazy 😭😭 they really said The Button: All-Stars
Make cody permanent button
Omg this is the best video ever. I feel like a proud mom watching my sons first recital
This felt like a season finale. Every single one of Cody’s button videos leading up to this A masterpiece truly 😄
Why is Cody on the girl side
Who is the last girl?
I swear Jesse should've said "well you don't have to call me Jesse, you can call me daddy" and she would've changed her mind 😂  Also, that "austiiin!" "....mmmbuttoonnn!" exchange caught me so off guard and was one of the funniest things ive seen in a long time 😂💀
MORE CODY BUTTON
Jesse is hot
this is the first episode of the button i’ve actually watched directly from the Cut channel
0:54 is that wheely guy? Didn't Cody interview him too lol?
NO WAYYYYY
we live in a world where fat ugly chicks are rejecting bodybuilders because theyre not good looking enough
This. Is. LEGENDARY.🎉
I FEEL LOKE I LEFT A COMMENT ON ONE OF CODYS VIDEOS LIKE A YEAR AGO ABOJT TJOS
The first girl awkward af
Using Cody’s new song as an outro is FUCKING AWESOME
YESSS
I WANTED THUS YESSSSSSSS
8:36 brutal 😂😂😂😂
This was literally the funniest epispde of the button EVER😂😂😂
I also enjoyed how this is like The Button: All Stars
this is honestly the v first Button video I've watched from the actual Cut channel because every other one I watched was on Cody's
omg Cody 😂😂😂 so crazy
Bruh dating someone with kids isn't a good thing if u ain't looking to really settle down.....my mom used to date back in the day and my twin and I got attached to these men but then one day the disappeared and we were broken... So if u are a serial dater with kids never introduce your partner to your children just don't.....
OHHHH I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE
"I'm 5'8""...."How tall is that?"       Lady it's 5'8", he just told you.
oh man this was hilarious
THIS IS THE BEST BUTTON VIDEO BY FAR!!!! thank you Cut for organising this video!! it made me smile so hard the entire time, and the cast did such a great job too!!
YAAAS FINALYY
whoever suggested to show a picture of that dude’s kids and make the button red at the same time is EVILLLL
*OHHHH MY GODDDDDD*
I'm so happy for Cody rn
WE WANT MORE OF THIS!!!
I need a part 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and so on of this please and thank you
This  is too perfect, was just binging his shit lol
It's really fun to see the people laugh at Cody's jokes
Wait wtf it's finally happening ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
IT HAPPENED
FINALLLYYYYYYY
FINALLLYYYYYY!!!!
Yes Cody!!!!!!Big dub!!!!
More guest buttons! More Cody!
Didn't like the colab ngl
we need him back
the first girll is annoying as hell
The face when Cody saw Austin hahahahaha! 7:10
YOOOOOOOOOOOO
Not Jesse gaslighting her at the end with spelling of his name 😭😭
what a collab oml  Cody crushed it
at last
🤣🤣🤣🤣
When I saw Austin was back, I figured I'd give him some rope and see if he's not the same small-minded, misogynistic, pompous asshole he was the last time we saw him. Turns out he hung me with it. Cody was cool, though. And it's always good to see Jesse.
FIANLLY
cody had this be the most unhinged episode of the button ever
DAMN i laughed so much during this, Cody should do this more often xDD
This is tooooo funnyyyy
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Would love to see a second vid of this
Not really fair when someone like Serena enters this show... :)
I don't know whether to laugh or cry 😢😂
"Diversatile"
i have been DREAMING of this day
I wonder how Jesse will feel when he figures out he gets pegged later
Finally
this was the happiest day of cody’s life
This was the funniest “the butten” episode by faaaar 😂👌🏻
I wish they show the person behind the button more
<3
Everything I could have ever dreamed of and more.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!! Give the rights to the show to Cody already!  He is so good at it on a first try 😂😂Want more!!
cody should b promoted from intern to full time position. just sayin'
ey yo this was hilarious as shit!!!!
Oh man that was such fun😂 pls part 2
You ever been to court? 😂😂
we need more‼️
i love that the whole crew hates austin😭😭😭
this episode is cursed
this is hands down the funniest button video ever
OMG OMG OMG
CODY MAKING ME FKN CACCCCCKLEEEEEE TO THE POINT MY SICKLY LUNGS GAVE ME A COUGH ATTACK HAHAHAHAHA
Damn The biggest calibration since 1981’s Superman and Spider-Man
Bring sam hyde on to voice the button
the way i busted a gut so many times thru this
Jesse converses the same way I do. I love to see crackhead representation.
this was sooo gooood!!!!
Name of the girl in the thumbnail? Serena something ?
LET'S GO!!
Best episode ever
I love this video so fucking much
Omg yesssssssss😂
OH MY GODDDD FINALLY IM SO HAPPY FOR HIM
cody cody cody cody cody

FINALLY
The button should find love
best Button episode ever
What I didn’t read the caption I’m shocked
Jesse’s long awaited return, man walked into frame like an avenger to save this incredibly awkward video
OMG COLLAB OF THE YEAR
This is my favorite button video! Thanks for the amazing collab ☺️
i think i lived for this!! Cody 🤝Button
Bro was ready to get pegged
What's the last woman's name? Her IG? She's a legend. Totally here for the chaotic barbie energy!!!!
Having Guest Hosts is a FANTASTIC idea. 💯
That introduction alone " this is satan, welcome to hell" made this the best button episode ever 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE HIM
i truly haven’t laughed out loud to a video this much before
CODY! YAAAAASS!  I knew it would happen one day!! 🤩🤩🤩
We have been waiting sooo long for this video and it’s finally here! 😍
YESSSSSS LET'S GO CODYYYYYYY <3
PLEASE BRING CODY BACK
Funny how 2 guys asked the first girl if she workouts like they didn’t know the answer
3:22 BARS
The contentants were XXXtra this time.  😂
Wow, seeing Jesse and my dude Heelies is so nice to see. You have the woman that got told she looked old... gym guy... probably somebody else.
perfection i tell you
OMG
It finally happened !! 😭
Great cast and great job by Cody, phenomenal video 🔥
Cody really said, "how to *butt in* " and no one noticed the excellent, if the unintentional pun
god i hate austin so much
FINALLY
FINALLYYYYY
I love Jai 😂😂
so sick
Bring Cody back!
The crossover we all needed.
I can’t wait to watch Cody react/watch his episode of the button … buttonception
Awesome
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING!! SO AWESOME
Cody was so good!!!
So Austin is fatphobic and a fan of a pedophile smh. Why tf are y’all allowing him in this video??? I’m disgusted.
Oh my gosh this is the best type of cringe 😂
I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED IT YET IM JUST SO HYPED FOR THIS
The pure joy in Cody’s face is amazing I’m REELING from this
bro jessie and that girl who won were so chaotically perfect for each other
this is AMAZING
wdmgfsadgbfg favourite episodeee
And they plugged his song. That's dope
whats the last girl @
People who change their hair color often tend to be borderline 🤣
Millionth comment but literally the collab we’ve been waiting for…can’t believe I’m actually hyped about this
Can Cody be the button forever
this is genuinely the best episode ever, y’all brought out the big guns by bringing back iconic people he reacted to in the past 😭 so much better than I expected
Peak cinema
WHAT
No flipping way yall just did this
That last girl is definitely a dom 🥵
crossover of the century
This is the most wild episode I’ve ever seen AND I NEED MORE!!!
Cody needed to do this!!
Finally
BEST EPISODE EVER
STOP BRNING AUSTIN
Holy shit I can’t stop laughing this was gold
This is such a good idea! You should do it with other YouTubers
Bro said “not that”🤣🤣🤣
Omg this just made me so happy
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
THE JESSE FINESS
ahahahahahahaa
W wasians lol
Again!
FINALLY!
That must have been the greatest day of his life. Mind you his child isn't born yet. I assume that day will be even better for him. Who knows though
Omg I LOVE JAIIII
FINALLY
Anyone know who the last girl is?
austin is def into pegging
Cody should just permanently be the button
3:24 “how to butt in” BUTTIN….BUTTON?
Golly Austin is quite something 😶🚩🚩🚩
drake.......fans
Cody Ko needs to do this every time
austin is fr smt LMAO
jai is soooo funny and she sound like one tita the way she say "GARRAUNTEE" 🤙🏼 cheeee
when jesse showed up it felt like when the beloved character appears at the end of the movie to help finish the battle. like peter parker in end game
“THIS IS SATAN, WELCOME TO HELL.. MUAHAHAHAHA!”  Has me ROLLING 🤣🤣
first girl scared tf outta me.
I will venmo whoever gives me the pegging girl's insta, $100
I’m dying 😂😂😂😂
NO FUCKING WAY
cut having hard time finding baddies it seems
This is the best episode i've seen so far buufwf
NO WAYYYYY
i'm obsessed with this, not only because it's like watching a kid's dreams come true but also because i can tell Cody is absolute besties with the producers
I need Jesse, Austin, Logan and Nut in the same video... please make it happen, I beg you
Oooo sheeeeitttttttttt
ive never been happier
Dude assumed that the girl that got backstage passes was sucking dick! You can't just buy those passes, but that's still wild af to say on a first date 😅
“Dammit I’m doing the horny thing” 😂
Bring Cody back so often I literally laughed the whole time this is great
omg i hate austin EWWWW
just wait until the last couple are banging and she calling our her brothers name thats "spelled differently" but sounds the same.
Shouldve used that high bass tone.DAMMIT Cody...why tf did u even go there...
Austin is the only hope left for this channel. Not being a snowflake and expressing his emotions with blunt honesty. Double standards my ass
PLEASE STOP BRINGING BACK AUSTIN
finallllllllllly!!!!
Petition for Cody to voice the button from now on
we need more videos with cody, had me actually laughing out loud. bring him back !! i’m sure everyone would agree
I hope Cody sees this he would be so happy
Best episode of the button ever😂😂. Love it
This collab video couldn’t have gone any better
Cut off the rails was one of the best ones in a while 😂 🚂
last girl has to come back idec what for she just has to
oh my god
banger vid w codys fave button dates too
WHO LET HIM HAVE FUN!?
This was such an amazing crossover episode 😂 seriously so solid of the cut to play Cody’s new song at the end for promo. PLEASE BRING CODY BACK
first time watching the actual button video not just someones reaction to it, scary times
jesse was so faded
The moment we all waited for
NO FUCKING WAY DUDE
Can we please have him more on the button
Yes best move you could have done 🎉💯
Laughing button is scary
Cody’s facials are priceless 👌🤣🤣🤣🤣 We so need more of Cody on the show 🤣
This was actually the best surprise ever
the vibes of this episode are incredible
This is the best cut video to ever exist
Absolute Masterpiece. Love Cody Ko!!
Cody hasn't ever been this happy ❤ I'm so glad he got to do this 😂
god i’m in love with jesse warren
THIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO OF THE BUTTON PLEASE HAVE CODY ALWAYS ON PLEASE
So funny
Highlight of 2023
This was everything I wanted it to be and more.
cody ko has seen my dad naked and my dad is now SCARED of him
Austin doesn’t deserve to get pegged
This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen pls just have Cody host the button 😭
i’ve been waiting for cody to be on the button !!💚
First time watching the OG button video. I'm so used to just waiting for Cody to react
woman is literally obese asking for a man taller and the only reason for rejection but the man says not into that and its a problem
FINALLY
Okay but Jesse knows nothing ab the pegging thing which is hilarious
OMGGGG
What the fuck
9:27 bro let his intrusive thoughts WIN 😭😭😭😭
To be fair I've also rejected a guy because he had the same name as my brother and dad. Too weird 😂.
I don't know if it's the bossy attitude or because she's absolutely gorgeous, but damn, that last girl gives me the hots
YOOO THIS IS MY FAVOURITE EPISODE BY FARRR🎉🎉🎉🤣🤣🤣😭
I got so excited when I saw cody was going to be in this, also this episode was crazy what was going on
NO WAY
This is my 19 year old version of crossover episodes
This is INCREDIBLY UNHINGED
They brought back all the iconic characters for Cody 😂
CODY NEEDS TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME PLEASE
THIS IS GREAT
BEST EPISODE EVEE
The Button Allstars, & Selena is a new legend. From "want to peg my fiancé" to "you're giving me crackhead energy", and "I need Adderall man", total GOAT
no fucking way
BEST EP SO FAR
damn, bros a wingman to my boy jezxie
i can’t believe they got cody to be the button cut knew what they were doing with this one. laughed the ENTIRE vid
SO EXCITED OMG
NO WAYYYYYY
Undoubtedly the best button episode of all time, even ended up getting crazy Jesse a date, 11/10 episode 😂😂😂
USE THIS AS A WE NEED MORE CODY KO BUTTON COLLABS
Cody needs to be the new button!!
THE BUTTON SAYING OUCH IS WHAT SENT ME
YESSSSSSSS I've been waiting for this crossover!!!
Ain’t no way bonko wore boxer shorts and got a tan 💀💀
FINALLY HE GOT HIS CHANCE!!!!
Great episode!
Perfect Disney crossover episode. I dissociated
Y’all gotta do this again
cody looks like a kid in a candy store, i'm so happy. this is like seeing brittany broski meeting harry styles for the first time
Finally
Can we have more of him or other funny people? Love the og button but this was an amazing change of pace. Would love to see Theo von run it.
this was exactly what we needed, thank you cut
sell out
First cut video I really ever watched besides on Cody’s channel lmfao
hahahha that was amazing
WHHHAAAT
more more more
I can't wait for Cody to react to this one
This might be my new favourite video ever
cody. you fucking made it.
"Not that" damn!!!!
FINALLY
BEST EPISODE !
The BEST episode so far easily
IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE
YES. YES.
LET'S FUCKING GO
I’ve been waiting for this collab😭🩵
FUCK YEAAAHHHHHHHHH!  Sorry I have been waiting for this !! Love you Cody
So hyped for this video
NOO WAYYY
Awesome!
Literally been waiting my whole life for this
this is just great
Cody making everyone laugh is amazing
11:58 biggest red flag, you can love both why hate dogs like girl stfu
WE WON!!!!!!
So funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cody being here is a full circle moment
i thought this day would never come🙌🏻
Cody is a HILARIOUS button 😂😂😂 love that he had all the contestants dying
FINALLY.
obsessed w the first girl she was so funny n needs to be brought back in future videos!
Finally the two worlds collide! Would never about the button if it weren't for Cody! Thanks cody love you bro
You're fucking kidding. Oh my god
Cody has finished the game
Omg we need more of this.
yah ima need like 10 more of these videos
i love how she was like “you’re a psycho and i love it” LMAO
Austin makes me so insanely uncomfortable..... never liked him  tbh lmao
"your not physically attractive" "not that" BOY HAD NO MERCY
Yesssssss
Jai lame asl tf
Cody - I’m glad you got the opportunity to be the button - as a senior citizen, there was only so much time left. Great job.   Austin - You suck. You resemble a dirty q-tip found in the garbage can on a cruise ship. I hope you never find love or get pegged.   Anya, - you are STUNNING. The first thing in my head when you walked out was ‘damn, she’s gorgeous.’
W. So awesome.
BEST IDEA EVER 😂😂😂
cody was secretly the button the entire time
that first girl was GOLD
god please do more with cody
we’ve come full circle
oh. my. god.
this is in fact the best episode of the button we love to see it
so proud of cody he looks so happy
It's so strange that that one chick wanted to peg the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with just once. That's a very extreme activity to only want to do once. She is too crazy for Charles Manson.
Yessss Cody you finally got it
austin is grossssssssss
FINALLY
this video healed me like this was genuinely the most i’ve laughed in a while lollll
This is the most unhinged button I have ever seen, and I’m here for it
This video was amazing and hilarious 😂 will be rewatching it for sure
SHORT KINGS REACTING LIVE INSIDE THE BOX @CodyKo
I have been waiting for this forever
FINALLYYYY
OMG FINALLY
FINALLY
i’ve been so scared to watch this since it came up now cuz im scared it’s not gonna be everything i’ve dreamed of but im gonna do it
FINALLY
LFGGGG
This was the best!
I am SOOOO EXCITED FOR THIS I TOLD MY BF CODY WILL BE THE BUTTON AND 2 days later he is!!!!!
history was made
love this collab
um . I need 100 more episodes of this . expeditiously .
YESSSS
Wait please bring Cody back again
great video, loved noel’s disguise!
How was this so goooood?!?!?!?!
Bring cody back as a recurring guest 😂
Austin has… a way with words for sure. “8:28 you’re just not physically attractive”???? usually when people aren’t attracted to someone and it comes up they will say “I’M not attracted to you”. also “did you suck a dcck” and so on… he needs to chill out
Hilarious, Cody needs to star in this more often.  Austin looks like Scott Peterson in this one.
This is what we have all been waiting for
this is like end game but the button
WE FINALLY GOT THIS VIDEO OMGGGG I AM CRYINGGGG
its about MF time @Cut keep them coming with cody hosting
This was so chaotic
first minute and im already dying
Love the Cut employee in the background that you can hear saying "he sucks" twice about Austin
8:36: He called her a 'that' 😭😭😭 Ruthless, indeed.
Austin is funny asf 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg I love Austin 😂
Best episode ever - Cody should be the voice of the button for every episode
what is 10:35 girl's INSTAGRAM PLEASE SHES GORGEOUS!!
BEST COLLAB AND VIDEO OF THE YEARRRRR YESSSSS LOVED THE ENERGY THE WhOLE TIME WOW
Holy shit Cody is so funny in this
7:17 IM DEAD
finally!!
even plugged his song at the end that's so wholesome haha
I don’t like Austin
omggg emile is back
the way i was evilly laughing along with Cody the whole time- 😂😂😭
undoubtedly, the most chaotic episode. 😹
MY FAVOIRTE THING CAN THIS ME PERMANT
Hopefully jesse has a middle name
CODY
The bald/workout dude looks like Joshua Jackson
Cody you are a married man. Please stop moaning as the button.
My life is complete
Cody needs to be the only button commentator
i feel so bad for any person austin has ever interacted with in his whole life
thank you thank you thank you
This is fantastic 🎉
this is the first cut video I’ve watched that’s not on Cody’s channel
Thank you for giving us EXACTLY what we wanted.
I NEED MORE
cody blink twice if they have kidnapped you and forced you to make this video
Honestly Cody doesn’t have to say anything when Austin is talking. We just KNOW.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
3:27 is a crazy double entendre 🤯🤯
This is the best video on youtube.
YES!
Pt. 2?
he made this show so much less awkward
What in the actual crap is happening
8:22 this guy just has bad vibes all around lol
First girl definitely from Hawaii 😂 I heard a little pidgin
Do another
The crossover we’ve been waiting for since the first button video
the producer telling cody to say all that crazy stuff shows how insane the producer of this show is lmaooo
this was soooo good. pls do more with cody
I think the lesson here is not to judge a book by its cover.
this was actually hilarious
Cody Ko needs to host more!!! Try to get him set up in his own place so that way he can completely fuck with the cast! These will go so hard
THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED
Yesssss I Love This For Him 👏🏽
OOOOOMMMMGGGGGAHAJDJAKSJAKSKSK IM FREAKING OUT THIS WAS LONG AWAITED!!!
Holy shit it happened
honestly i hope this gives them ideas om how to do the comments better bc it was way more entertaining this way (it did help tho that some of the things the participants said were absolutely unhinged)
10:21 I probably the most I ever been not prepared for a question ever asked on this show
Austin was super weird and anti black ngl
It's 1 am, I'm supposed to be silent bc my roomies are sleeping and I am screeching laughing and tapping my feet. How come you're bald 😭 I'M HOLLERING if y'all don't make Cody a regular member i stg I've never enjoyed this so much
i clicked on this video so fast
Austin was so incredibly rude for that … what did she do to you? That was so hard to watch 😌
Finally
this is the collab we’ve all been waiting for
How cool will it be when his baby is growing up to show them this?!
NO WAY
"You're just not physically attractive, unfortunately." Would sit with me for the next 3-5 years I swear LMAO that was cold
11:40 I have no idea who this guy is but he gives Markiplier vibes
10:05 yall made a really good choice
Please make kody the official button person
This was the funnest button video ever 😂. Also cannot believe that two Bulgarians showed up, and our return guy won 🥳🥳🥳
this was a great video
He dilutes the cringe and it helps, first one that I could sit through, hope there'll be more coming!
8:15 SHIT
have been wanting this to happen forever
so happy to see the funniest man alive on this
So so happy about this video. 🥲😁
I did not enjoy that guy at all
This was the best button episode ever
I’ve never been this excited for a video
This is the best day ever
This was the button on crack, I laughed so hard that I was tearing up throughout the whole vid
Austin is basically a meme at this point
11:40 hes sleeping outside
We need to see the button bts more often, the producers saying “did he just say that” was golden
The best cross over ever
We love what we see
I <3 Cody
3:25 how to button? Yeah you could say that..
GUYS IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THE GUY WITH THE FLORAL SHIRT LOOK LIKE S.COUPS 😭
More
I was waiting for this
This is my favorite episode by far, so good.  MmmMmm button...
i never thought this would happen. go Cody!!
This was a monumental moment is pop culture
When Austin bumped the button and Cody yelled OUCH I almost peed my pants 🤣
One of the best videos on the internet now
Please do a part 2 with Cody!
WE WANT MORE
Emil ily
1:40 holy fuck
How is no one talking about the fact that, that guy said “it’s not spelt like your brother’s. It’s spelt with a z and an x” 💀
PLEASE LET MORE PEOPLE BE THE BUTTON THIS WAS GOOOLD   GREAT JOB CODY!!
i love the last girl shes so mommy i would let her peg me 😳😳😛

WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
YES BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
ive never enjoyed an episode of the button more
This is awesome 😂
The crossover I’ve been waiting for
The video was too short
No wayyyy
Jessy😊
I think Austin might be the love of my life
Congrats to Jexze for winning
THIS S SO AWESOMEEEE
AMAZING SO FUNNY I LOVE CODY
Go back to the normal stuff. smh

I’ve never seen Cody so happy, thank you for assembling his Avengers team of Button stars
YESSS FINANLLY OMLLL
Fire bro
Cody should do one where the rooms can see the dates
omg i gasped this is the ultimate crossover
who let cody have fun again😏
Austin can suck it
The last chick was smooth asf!
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE WITH CODY!!!!!!!! @Cut
WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
“This is Satan, welcome to hell” 😂😂😂
No freaking way
THIS WAS AN AMAZING BUTTON
I wish this were an hour!!!
I was about to put my phone down to sleep until I got a rush of excitement when I found this video. It’s finally here. The best button video ever.
Cody ko fans recognize every single person that showed up in this video hahah😭
holy sh*t this episode felt like the nba celebrity game 🤣 its a 10 from me
Hell yesss Cody officially made this better 🎉
FINALLY
THE BEST BUTTON YET
Honestly thank you so much for doing this...
HE MADE ITTTTTTR
No fucking way
Cody straight ended the shoot to get his man a second date
FINALLY
How Austin keeps getting a invite is beyond my comprehension🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽
mmmmmBUttoNN!
I love that he made them laugh ILY CODY
This was hilarious! Best episode to date!!! So funny!😂
I can’t even explain how excited I was to see you finally got to do this Cody! You nailed it dude
This is so so good
9:02 The way he did that was too much PLZZ I’m dying of laughter 😂
The fact that Austin threw out that “sucking d*ck” line and the girl didn’t even get close to the button is wild
Best. Episode. Ever.
Use this as the “let cody be the new button” button lol
NO WAY whoevers idea this was needs a promotion
This guy is great 👍🏽
WTF OML THIS WAS ROUGH TO WATCH MAS
BRING CODY BACK!!! he's just so funny
its hard to "BUTT - ON" the conversation lol
This girl is definitely murdering that guy at the end of there date.
😂❤😭
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
They find all these fairly good looking guys but always consistently bring on fat unattractive women. It must be done on purpose, like they’re trying to change what men are naturally attracted to to push this weird feminist/“body positivity” agenda. You can tell 90% of the guys are just uncomfortable or even disgusted and masking it, and then the whales will immediately skip because of one tiny detail they nitpicked at. We need to stop lying to these women and gassing them up; it’s absurd that these low value women have any standards at all, let alone think they deserve some high caliber man.
Your lying this so good and such a specific interest 😂😂😂 for those that watch Cody
7:05 The handshake plz hahaha 😭
the "Austiihiihinnn!!!" "...mmmButtonnn!!!" is KEELLING MEEE
Even promoting cody’s new song, cut W
Well ill be damned we saw this day comin now we can die in peace😂
This was the best Cut video ever made
why did i not realize this is how the button works??🤣
I love this
So kind of you to feature the elderly on your show <3
I haven’t laughed so hard at a button video before
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. I felt led to share this with you all 🥰
FINALLY!!!
The last 2 are gonna fuck like wild animals and hurt each other emotionally after a few months
that guy Austin is old news and literally a misogynist  why does he unironically  keep getting cast
Innnnncredible
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
The Button All Stars Edition ft Cody KO
This is amazing
Best button video! Cody Ko should do this for every episode
This should have been a thirty min cut video 😂
This is the most fun episode
holy fuck
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE OF A MAN AUSTIN IS LMFAOAOAOAO
This is the best button video omg 😂😂😂
I can’t wait to watch Cody’s reaction to this video 😂
YESSSS YOUTUBE IS GETTING BETTER
Amazing episode, I'm so confused by the two that matched, like they didn't seem convinced in the slightest and she thinks he's a total psycho!? haha fair enough XD
@9:13 ARE*** there some sparks!!
The moment we’ve all been waiting for 😭
Bringing back specific people that Cody noticed during his videos was such a great idea
why are the best people on this episode
poggy
You guys HAVE to have him back, I haven’t had this good of a life in a while
👋🖲️
Austin stopped mentally maturing in middle school
YES YES YES YES YES!!
Funny enough this episode had a generic brand Noel Miller😂😂😂😭😭
OMGG
Listen if the marina and Jessi don't work out she can peg me on the button
Idek this cody guy but this verison of the button was fucking EPICC i LOVED ITTTT please do more!!!❤❤❤
Jessie and the girl (Marina?) are absolute crazy the same way as they are beautiful. They make such a nice couple that I feel they're gonna get married thanks to this show. It will be lovely, I loved them. Jessie deserves a lovely person that's fun, beautiful and calms him down, I loved it. (I got a crush on him and now I'm a little hurt tho lol hahaha but it's all good, I still mean it)
my life’s been fulfilled…
I've never seen Cody before but this episode was really good!
This is like avengers endgame. Good luck trying to improve on this
Best button video ever
The first cut video I’m watching without Cody reacting to it
i’ve been waiting so long for this
now this is iconic
“You’re just not…physically attractive” i watched her face drop, that’s so sad ugh. “what are you looking for?”….”not that” HUHHHH? Austin is awful
Bring Cody back again!!!
we’ve come full circle
We made it bois.
cody i love u king
We need more Cody. This needs to be a thing,
Geez Austin is a major dickhead you can definitelyyyy express not finding someone attractive without saying it like that, ew. Anyways, loved Cody in this! Lol

They brought back the heelie guy and the blind dates go through each other's phone guy...
THANK YOU
This is so damn cool man I can't believe they actually did it
The last girl is so annoyinh
i was smiling ear to ear the whole time i love this collab
Seeing behind the scenes makes it so much more fun
this has to be the funniest button episode ever. please have him do more
“ … you ever been to court…?” ⚰️
It took me until Cody said it to realize that The Button is not only a dating show with a button, but the button also BUTTS IN 🤯
i fucking despise austin
I’ve been waiting for this moment 😅

that was on top 3 best episodes ever
MORE GUEST BUTTONS, PLEASE!!!!!1
This was fantastic
Sick
oh my fucking god. i've been waiting on this legendary collab for months
I will be watching this over and over. So wholesome 😁
Austin is such an unlikable person. Yikes. It's giving "I'm secretly insecure and miserable, and do a bad job trying to hide it by being obnoxious and rude."
This was THE best episode of The Button 👏🏻
You killed it, Cody! 😂🥰
this was the funniest button episode ever
that was SO fun
Eeewww to Austin’s comments
Ugh, not a stuck up influencer getting involve in this. 🙄🙄🙄  Please bring back the anonymous button.
he needs to be the new button. he deserves it 😂
jesse can change his name theyre perfect for each other
About time Cody got behind that voice 🤣
Thanks for bringing back past contestants 🎉
YAY CODY ON THE BUTTON
this is omg love
This is the best button vid from both cut and Cody. In the nicest way possible. Please keep making these!🙏
Austin can kick rocks and if I ever see him I'mma kick his
FINALLY
Hahah I knew Cody would takeover the button!!!! This is so funny 😂
this is the moment we have all been waiting for
I never clicked on a video so fast
Wait that one guy was so rude and weird
Best episode 😭😭😭
NO WAY????
I’m newly single of  1 year just letting you know
been waiting for this
HE MADE IT
I need so much more of this
Add new people in your experiment please
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO CODYYYYYYY
FInally! Button has peaked.
I thought this was a Cody ko video lol
Holy shit, he did it. 😳
They need to have Timothy Delaghetto and David So take over the button😅
This is so amazing, I love everything about this!!! Cody killed it!!🔥🔥🔥
FINALLY!!
this is the best thing ive ever watched
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN FOR SOOOO LONG 😭😭😭😭😭
BRING CODY BACK!
Omg funniest video ever!!! The Hawaiian shirt dude was a super cee u next Tues
Talking about abusing adderall is cringe af that shit is actually very addictive and makes you speed like meth 😂
10:28 - 10:30 Cody's face switched from horror to an opportunity for a joke
I’m sorry but why is nobody talking about Austin moaning “mmButToN” that shit had me absolutely cackling
It's a VERY difficult thing to make me actually laugh thru a screen while I'm alone in my room yet here I am after watching it twice in a row laughing for basically the entire thing both times. Major props. fkn love Cody, so glad he got to voice the button in this one.
Cody needs to stand in from now on
Yoooooo. What the fuck is going on
YESSSS THIS IS SO GOOD IM SO HAPPY
Please make this a regular thing omg
Thank you Cody 😀💛
FINALLY OMG
This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I loved seeing this button video so much especially with Cody being in it brought it more fun
FUCK WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
comedy fucking gold
Always the fat ones that want a tall guy the double standards.
The stars have aligned
Too u long enough, Cut.
NOOO WAYYYYY
Omg
This is so iconic
made me nearly cry laughing but why did he send her home with someone she clearly wasn't into 😭
No fucking way🫨🫨🫨
Lol cody is the best.
8:26: "You're just not physically attractive [TO ME]" Fixed it! Next caller 📞
OMG YES
oh my gor
Austin!!!

I’ve been waiting for this moment
I’m happy that Jesse loves cats!
PLEASE do more this is the best wow!!!!!!!!!
This was absolute GOLD
no freaking way! YAY!
IMMEDIATELY YES. Please give us more of this
this was perfect. Cody must be a series
I LOVE THIS EPISODE
Cody Ko on the button NEEDS to happen again
“AUSTINNNNN” 😂
Omg omg omg omg this is such a treat🥹
HE KEPT THIS HIDDEN FROM US
Hawaiian shirt guy is definitely a serial killer
knowing that the real button person is probably laughing and trolling just as much as cody does is such a hilarious thought
Honestly I’d love to see more behind the scenes. I’d love to see the “button” reacting in real time.
WHATTTTTTTTT
WE NEED MORE CODY BUTTON VIDEOS
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS HAHAHA I LOVE IT
As a Cody fan this made me so fricking happy ❤
Please do this again. Please.
This made me so happy, 10/10 episode
Cool of Cut to promote Cody’s new song. Both channels are legends
Cody is so qualified for this job sign him
Petition for Cody to host every episode!
This has been the best episode of the button I have ever seen
Cody = replace button
Austin was a total red flag, like thank you to the girl for rejecting him and skipping him. I was tired of seeing him on the screen.
Glad to see a small and upcoming youtuber like cody gets a chance at something big
YESSS IT FINALLY HAPPENED
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for.
this needs to happen more best button video
Y’all understood the assignment, thank you
this was hysterical
If life was a competition.....Cody would be winning!
10:05-10:12 had me dying in laughter 😂🤣
This is a godly collab from kody and cut 🔥🔥
That was beyond wild. 11/10
Basically been waiting my whole damn life for this lol
THIS
Finally
This has been, quite possibly, my most favorite episode of the button! We need more Cody!
"not that" honesty in its most brutal and direct form 😂 I felt for her, whe she watches it later
More Cody plssss, he is an awesome button lol
this HAS to be a regular thing omg that was so much fun
This is the video I've been waiting for my whole life
Cutting to the person that controls the button is THE move. You should keep this up for future videos
FINALLY!!!!! BEST.DECISION.EVER
That pegging girl needs to stop whatever she’s doing…
I need more of this! Laughed so much 😂 one of the best episodes
This is the best vid I’ve seen in a while
they got cody ko no way
This was absolutely delightful, please do it like ten more times
more more more
finally
I need an hour long version pls
Austin is joji in disguise and joji is filthy frank in disguise
I’m am shitting bricks about Cody being “The Button”
Need more of this omg
NO WAYYYYYY
This was absolutely incredible to watch. The crossover we needed.
this is monumental
Cody, full time button. Plleeassee🎉🥳
Austin’s response to Cody😭  “BuTToNNn” lmao
on of my fav videos ever loved
yall NEED to let cody do this more often !!
This was beautiful. Thanks Cut for inviting our dad.
I totally got fuckboy-ish vibes from Austin from the beginning and then he just kept confirming it the more he talked. But I also love how Sabrina called him (and herself) out, ha.   I've seen a few of Cody's videos and hope they do another collab video (as I think the episodes tend to be better when the Button is a little less pervy).
My world's have collided and idk how I feel lol
the last girl has such a nice aura
This has been the BEST button
Can’t wait for Cody to react to his own button version
I can’t wait watch Cody react to this ‼️
no fucking way
YESSS
She is a walking red flag
So this is the new format, right? It’s going to be Cody every time… right? 👀
Golden
Is Cody sick … was this his make a wish
Absolutely golden
THIS VIDEO IS WHAT I LIVE FOR
Jesse for the win bro
OMGGG
THIS IS AMAZING
I only know what this series is because of Cody, so well deserved
YESSS CODYY
Not horny enough from the button
the producer making cody-esque jokes just shows how he’s infiltrated everyone’s brains
please stop supporting this austin guy lol he actually sucks, it’s honestly not even entertaining at this point, it goes beyond cringe
NO I’M SAD EMILE AND THE OTHER PERSON DIDN’T MAKE IT THEY WERE SO CUTEEEEE
Fattest grin the entire 15 minutes. Cackling nonstop thank you
this is the best thing i’ve ever watched!! cody looked so happy lmao
I’m glad someone called out Jesse for being a psychopath.
OMGGGGERGEKMGDKGMRSDRG
THIS IS CRACK
This behind the scenes look is honestly so funny
Y’all did great on this, fan service is off the charts
This is awesome!

"a stepmom for you or for your kids?" LMFAOOOOOOOOO
Finally Cody on the button lol
Cody is having so much fun
I want to see the button person more often after seein Cody!
THIS US THE CRAZIEST EPISODE EVER
I don’t like Austin. Is it a red flag if a straight guy is too bitchy? Because he was *a lot.*
STOP I DID NOT WXPECT THIS 😭
This the best episode 🤣😭😭
This needed to happen
The cross over that the multiverse needed
Whoever’s idea it was to put Austin, Banko, and Jesse on the Cody episode needs a raise
“Austinnnnnn” “ mmmm buttonnnnn”😂🤣🤣 7:18
Wanting to watch this so bad but also not wanting to incase cody makes a video on it 😂😭 #firstworldproblems

Alvin is cringe
FINALLY!!!!!! Cody KO on the button
CODYYYYYY
This was amazing
There's no way
FIRST GUY ASKING HER DO U LIKE THE GYM AS HE LEFT IS SO FUNNY LOL
So yall just choosing to ignore austin calling a black woman “not attractive” but also “not that” - when Cody asked who he wants to date??

Jesus Christ, finally.
My favorite episode by far! It felt like we were in that voice booth with Cody and that was awesome!

What a crossover lol loved it!
OMGGGG

I RAN home when I saw this
the entire interaction at 7:52 is so incredibly funny
Even the staff can’t stand Austin 💀
this was incredible
THIS IS GREAT. Also, Austin is Squidward.
Can cody just become the voice for the button from now on
BEST COLLAB EVER
Tbh its because of cody that this is the most watchable button video for me lol
I’VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THISSS
This was sick, lol
OMG ITS FINALLY HAPPENED
So… Is Cody going to react to this episode of the button?
“How do you spell your Jessie?” “With a Z and an X”
Best episode
this was hands down the best episode
Shoutout to the cut for giving a small creator this platform , so amazing to see
thank you?????
All these people had garbage personalities. Last dude was the list genuine. And that chic was throwed off.
PLEASE HAVE CODY ON AGAINNNN
Dreams do come true
Omfg im so excited!!!!!!  Edit after watching: They had the most awesome people on this episode too! Loved this! 😂
I love how they got some of the classic button players back!!
Jai is so mf funny
YESSSSSSSSS
Cody being the horny button wasnt on my 2023 bingo card
AHHHHHH YESSSSS CODY MADE IT LETS GOOOOOO!!!!
Favorite button video so far
this is what we neededddd
FINALLY
FINALLY!!!  Doing the LORD's work with that last couple, Cody. lmaoo
This was like a reunion of old-school characters with the man itself as the button!
That was fun. I like the final 2.
Nobody has ever laughed at the button during the show until this video 🤣
Who’s that ASMR girl she’s so funny
This was too good lol
The only button video I’ve watched that was not on Cody’s chanel 😂😂
OHHH MY GOD
BRING HIM BACK 😂😂😂
Oh my god... he did it. He fucking did it.
Austin is the problem. The arrogance is crazyyy
I think someone needs to show Jesse the graph of crazy vs. hot.
I fever thought they would actually do it
i like that we’re getting a live reaction from cody
Broooo please bring more of this type of stuff!!. Would love to see peeps like Ludwig do an episode! More Cody too please! He's my boy :)
Boooooooooo.
cant wait for a reaction vid to this
pegging…
AINT NO WAY.
I want them to have Cody voice it regularly he’s so funny Omg
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉 hopefully Cody does more of these😂😂😂😂
YALL BETTER GET HIM BACK
umm i love how they brought back some of the toxic OGs from old vids loll
Cody should be a standard in the button
Pls make this a new series
LFG
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY MY WHOLE LIFE
HOLY FUCK.
Jesse stumbled out from backstage having been raised by cats this last 3 months. Now devastated the only human voice he's heard in months just rejected him.  Until the next awkward time stay strong and keep the sewers safe with the other homeless cats Jesse.
Never thought I’d see the day 🤯
Cody fullfilled his wildest and most desired dream. I could not be happier for something so trivial and for somebody I have never met in my life😂😂
Kody to the moon
Yessss best collab
top tier content
Finally !!!!
OMG THIS IS ICONIC
The episode we’ve all been waiting for
I need to see a second Cody Ko being the button video !This was gold!!
This is the best button episode I’ve seen by far 🤣🤣 please keep making them with Cody!!
Yaaaaas finally
i love this
Can we just let him take over the button from now on? 😂 This was gold
Every time Austin appears on the button he exposes himself as more of an awful person
best video ever
why was i smiling the whole video
They really got some of the OG guests back in here. Felt like Avengers endgame with Cody as the omnipresent god in the background as the button 😂
BOP IT STREAM TF OUT OF IT
Nah man, there's a difference in being brutally honest, and just plain rude.
I've never clicked on a video so fast
Haha I haven't laughed so much during these then this one lol😂
this is wayyy more fun to see what is going on behind the scenes and the couples, keep doing this and bring in more influencers!
I need this to be a thing
This was the craziest one yet
MY FAVORITE EPISODE BY FAR!!! It was so cool to see Cody Ko hosting, and it was a perfect decision to bring back some Button Legends like Jesse, the gym guy and the other dude, SO FUN!!!!
Why was this like The Button: All-Stars LMAOOOO
WHY DID SHE PRESS ON JESSE NOOOO
bruhhh mans did it
bro that austin guy gotta stop doing the show he ain’t gettin no bitches 😭😭
loved this collab 🥳 CODY MADE ITTTTT
Wht is Austin so terrible 😂
No way. It finally happened. Yasssss cody yasss 😂
Yo Jesse looks kinda 🥴
Please have Cody back again this was so funny
Can Cody be the button permanently??
As soon as Austin sat down, Cody knew EXACTLY what to say  7:13 was the funniest exchange in Button history
this needs to be every time
OMG YES!!! The video we’ve been waiting for. We need more of them!
The internet has peaked
FINALLY
First time I’ve laughed out loud watching the cut
such a proud moment
Austins 'so you suck dick?' Gave me such a visceral reaction that I think my reproductive system momentarily shut down. Way to be a misogynistic reprobate, proud of you babe xo
The day has finally come
Poor jesse he's gonna get pegged
I was really happy to see Emile tbh 🤷‍♀
CODYY I've waited for this my whole lifee🎉🎉🎉
Jai is kind of irritating I bet she’s sweet but nervous
This is my first time watching a button video actually posted by cut I always just see them through Cody’s channel
Please have Cody host every episode
OMG YES
Oh my GAWD 😂 best and most awaited crossover 😂
Ew Austin is disgusting please bring real genuine people on instead
“AUSTIIIIIIIIIN” “…mmmBUTTOOOON” made me scream😭😭
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Cody yelling “OUCH AHH OW OW STOP TOUCHING” when that one red flag of a guy knocked the button was my favourite thing ever i couldnt stop laughing 😭
you either die reacting, or you live long enough to see yourself become the button
I stg the last reaction video Cody made I thought "I wonder one day if Cody will be in a Cut video" AND LOOK WHAT WE HAVE HERE 🤩
This is the best thing that’s ever happened
I hate these videos but LOVE CODY so I had to watch
You are iconic!
Finally oh my God this is everything I’ve ever wanted
the arrogant guy wears a hawaiian shirt? in what world is he actually getting v
Who is Jessyx? lol

Most interesting one so far
NO WAYU THEY MADE HIM
Only here for Cody.

Finally
I am very disappointed Joaquin wasn’t in this episode , Cody will suffice
I’ve never clicked a video so fast

OMG!!!!!! This was hilarious!!
I was laughing so hard watching this
They cornered him an he said “do you like the gym”😂💀
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yooo it’s fuckin trending!!! Letssss gooo
I was dying the whole time cause no one made sense and I’m high asf ☠️
SOOOOO LEGENDARY LOVE IT BRING HIM BACKKKK
Wow, another match? That's rare!
the match making didn't seem as strategic this video 🤔
We have been waiting for this
Dude I need an hour of this
Can anyone tell me which videos have Jessie in them? He is very unhinged and I would like more of him
Beautiful lady at 10:05 is Lychee on Twitch
I would have totally get on one knee and propose to thar one girl who wanted to do something in the engagement night tho
cody has so much lore on some of these dudes i love how easily he checks them 😎
Austin, looking the way he does, shouldn’t be judging anybody. What a dick.
They definitely about to go do some addy, and put a puzzle together after some rough sex 😂😭
FINALLYYYY
“Pegggggging” 😂
Ok button, shell out the contract, get Cody on as full time host. Make the money right and he will no doubt take it
Austin deserves to meet…himself.
Cody is the moderator and the couple winning didnt really talk or flirt but almost made a drug deal hahaha
Cody as the button and Jessie and Austin in one episode??
This was definitely the best button yet Cut!!! Chuckled along with Cody the whole time
Glad to see that cody threw his old life away and got clean from coke.
what's up with the tiger wall? 😂
more of this
"i can't, i can't" 4:48
YES W CODY LETS GO!!!
love cody’s new song as the outro!!🥹
FINALLYYLYLYY
this is the hardest the contestants have ever laughed on this show. bring him back! this is the ultimate crossover! best thing ever!
now y’all needa bring amp agent
Jai kinda funny 😭🤚🏻
He’s been waiting for this. Everything in his career has led up to this moment.
that was literally the funniest fucking shit ive ever watched
I adore that they brought back people that Cody specifically noticed while reviewing Button videos on his own channel lol
no way...
7:17 LMFAOOO
he said 5’8…. but he sittin lower than her and she’s supposed to be 5’6😭😭😂
9:21
I'm really stoked this day has finally come but at the same time I'm kinda dissapointed that Cody didn't go more wild with his comments and mostly said what they gave him on the script instead :/
BEST ONE YET!!!!!!!
Please bring Cody back please!!!!
He should definitely continue doing this. Legendary
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!🫨🫨🫨
i dont think i couldve enjoyed this video any more.
no way😭😭😭
It’s all of the ALL STARS!!!! 🥰😄❤️🎉😂  good job Cody
this is the best button video EVER
This was my favourite button episode ever
LETS GOO
YES IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
Best day ever .
This was magical 😂
We need more with Cody lmao
I LOVE THIS FOR HIM HAHHAHAH. You can tell he's thriving
The first girl sounded so condescending at all times 😭   Jesse is unbelievably gorgeous
It’s wild to see the button voiced by someone who is actually funny and has a good personality
I love that Cody made the button evil laugh 😂
Bro has negative rizz💀
This was the best button yet!!!
I had to click it to believe it
i need at least like 10 hours of this!!!
cody fucked the first guy up 😭😭😭 he seemed like a gem lmaoooooo
I thought this was fake for a second-
okay but I NEED Marina and Jesse to actually date, they looked so good together!!
Oh my god finally !!!
I will watch this video only when Cody reacts to it.
Cody being more of a menace as the button is amazing
How did i not know that cody laughs like that
i think it’d be cool to see whoever is controlling the button in new episodes, even if it doesn’t cody  made the video 🤏 that much funnier to watch
Why did they pick the most unhinged button players this round
This was everything I hoped it would be and more
Please bring on Aba n Preach next
🔥😭😭I love how Cody was in this one. THIS WAS THE FUNNIEST ONE YET
Emile is so fine what is his @ does anyone know
I LOVE CODY KO
FINALLYYYYYYYYY
austin gotta be the worst person theyve ever had on this show
MAKE THIS A SERIES
ANOTHER ONE PLSSS
Austin practically lives on these dating shows. with his attitude he’ll never find anyone…
this is literally the funniest button episode i’ve seen 😭
FINALLY
finally the collab we Cody fans have been waiting for!!!!!!
LAST GUY I NEED THE LAST GUY SOOOO BADLY OMG
im so glad they brought on cody's favorite people
AND THEY PROMO BOP IT! HELL YEAH
petition for cody to be the voice of the button permanently
well done
“She has to reject him while looking at his children” LMAO BRUTAL PRODUCERS

AUSTIN IS WEIRD BRO LOL
I hate Austin
2:11 why the lie?
the button doing fan service THANK YOU 🤩‼️🫶
"boy, how come you're bald" Male equivalent: Girl how come you're fat *cancelled*
His time has come...
I NEED MORE CODY AS BUTTON!  Sorry but Cody is s tier button.
I NEED TO SEE FILMCOOPER ON HERE NEXT!!!
nah cody needs to be the button from now on lmfao.
Nice job butten that was awesome lol keep it up
OMG (I FORGOT THE NAME OF HER) BUT SHE AND JESSE OMG I LOVED HER.. ENERGY. AND THEY MATCH SO GOOD but the energy of the guy before him was AFWUL AAAWFUL
This was the first ever episode of the button I’ve watched and if you bring Cody back I’ll keep watching
5 mins in and this is the best one by far.
Please invite LUDWIG, this is awesome :D
That guy was insecureeeeee
This needed to happen
YEEESSSS haha finally
This video is awesome
Officially subscribing to Cut just because of Cody 😂
Nickname
FINALLYYYYYY <33333

the first botton video im actually wacthing on cut
“That wasn’t that bad” 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀the delusion
WHEN HE WENT OUCH LOL
OH MY GOD FINALLY
HOW LONG WE HAVE WAITED
Can’t wait for Cody to make a reaction video to this
this is gonna go down in history
Damn we need more videos with cody in the future!!!
NO FUCKING WAY LETS GOOOOOO
FINALLY
Been waiting for this one
I screamed so loud when I saw this post and I love love love it, it's what cody deserves  Edit :Cody brings another level to the button and makes it so much more fun, I was laughing so much throughout this video
I laughed too hard for this fucking episode
Pleaaaeaeaeassse how and where do I sign up to voice the button??😫😫
One of my favorites! Made me laugh too much haha
FINALLY
Oh my god
This is why being culturally informed is always relevant in relational dynamics. A Black girl or femme changing their hair “all the time” is a cultural phenomenon not a sign of pathology.
YESSSS
Idk why, but it feels like i watched it before.. especially the “brutal dude” segment
Austin is just like a rare breed of why tf do u do the things u do
THE COLLABORATION I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED!!
wow now I want every episode to be with Cody that was hilarious
Not the real button guy coaching Cody on the side
ITS HAPPENING🎉
YASSSS
Opening YouTube to this has made my entire week 😂💕
JESSSSE
I can't wait to see codys video on this
this was so yummy
genuinely took me out 7:15
why am i getting emotional about cody finally being on the button
amazing episode
YES YES YES YES
It's so funny getting to see how the staff reacts when people say crazy stuff
This just made my heart smile
I've never clicked a video as fast as i did to this video after seeing the title.
😂
brrrrrruuuh
CODYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yessssssss
Love the vutten guy on screen fun that way
Does Jesse know that Cody is there as a button?
What was the best episode of the Button and why was it this one 🥲
So awesome that Cody was the button! It’s his dream come true! I have watched all of his react videos to the cut shows. 😂😂😂😂❤
This was the video best
YESSSSSSS FINALLY
Omg
short king in a candy store
that was a cool cody kollab
I really liked the first girl
Idk if it was a good thing to watch this before he reviews it or not but I watched it lol
This is the first CUT Button episode I've watched from the CUT channel. I'd say this was a good one to start one. What a collaboration after all this time.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This could be a series with other YouTubers commandeering the showLOL
Austin’s got problems, dude
Imagine Cody and Noel doing this
Best episode so far
Is Austin the guy from the phone checking video who got triggered because the girl was in a much better shape than he was??
Cant wait for Cody to react to this
This was so cool of Cut to do, loved seeing Cody actually react in person AND having Jesse back on.
Ive been waiting for this colab forever I'm so happy to see it finally happening!
AND Cut is plugging Cody's new song at the end? Cut is a Class Act!
cody’s dreams came true
Nooo way it actually happened
Who's the last girl? She's so pretty!!
Love Cody. Austin wasn’t enjoyable. 😬
My boy, he finally made it🥹
Best episode, Another one!!!
AWESOME
No way
Austin is literally the worst dude on the planet and I need to see more of him lol
Maaan... I fucking love Cody
why does austin keep coming back
i havent giggled like this in a month
i love jai please come back
we need behind the scenes of whoever is controlling the button more
Best day of my life 😂😂😂
Jesse is so fine😩😩😩
CODY NEEDS TO VOICE MORE OF THE BUTTON
Best day ever
*chef’s kiss*
This was great. Bring him back, please! After years of watching his reaction and how awkward the other times were, this is hilarious😂😂
TGIS IS SO AWSOME
Austin continues to suck so bad. I hope he's playing a character cuz he's insufferable.  Makes for good TV tho
moreeeeeee
I got so excited when I saw the title
3:27 how to butt in?? More like how to BUTTON
YESSSSS
OMG YESSSS CODYYYYYYY! THE TIME WE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!!
I love Austin 😂
By far my fav episode  I laughed so hard bring him back again 🙌
cody ko is losing his mind in this appearance 🤯
I think Cody plays the button better than the original person that plays as the button
This is like when you have two different friend groups spend time together and it’s kinda fun but kinda stressful
cody did wonderful, also those last two 100% left and fucked 🤣
I think Cody plays the button better than the original person that plays as the button.
I think Cody plays the button better than the original person that plays as the button
WHAT
PLEASE STOP BRINGING AUSTIN BACK PLEASEE I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE DATING ANYBODY
jeez Cody did a great job - would love to see this format cutting between the button voicer and the people speed dating in the future, ads to the comedy
Cody needs to be a semi-regular at this omg. Actually make him and Kelsey do a duo, i think she would be so blunt towards the rude guys it would be so funny
OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭 CODY
YO I hardly ever comment though this episode was so good, so many characters and Cody was great! Do this again please
I feel like Cody being so good at this is going to cost someone their job
….respectfully she rejected him because of her own insecurities about her weight😂😂 projection at its finest. He’s in shape but she nit picks about how he looked at her?!
it did make me a little sad and uncomfy to see cody do the horny button with the last chick
AINT NO WAY
This is the best button video ever
everyone talking about cody but jai is the goat
I always thought it was a woman behind the button but now I see it could be Cody Ko 😮
FINALLYYY
YEESSSSSSSSSSS
The real I love Cody Ko Button 👇
the last girl its SO CUTE
i cant wait for cody to react to this
the first guy that looked like ezra miller is pure comedy. He really asked her "do you like the gym".
I love when Cody and the crew on the set laughs! It is a very good combo. Part 2 perhaps? =)
NO BLOODY WAY
I was just binge watching cody’s button videos this morning, so happy to see this!
One of the greatest collabs
OMGGGG
This is the funniest one 😂😂
OH MY GOD
here to share w the 5h club
Cody love Austin not a hard take
Absolutely need Cody back on. What an amazing video lol
we need so many more of these omg
Finally
Boring episode
La mejor collab del mundo que todos estábamos esperando
FINALLY YOU DID IT
this was psychotic and i loved every second of it.
This was the most unhinged episode ever and I loved it 😂
Cody saw firsthand just how easy it is to succumb to The Horny as The Button.
oh my god i love this
best episode
Austin... toxicity incarnate.
idk what it is about the left handed handshakes but they just feel so wrong
Amazing! Thank you
this is the hugest win in the century
jesse and marina meshed oddly well and not in a romantic way but on a like spiritual and molecular level and im not sure what that implies but they make sense together
2:20 Cody’s face bye
new top 10 yt video all time
Only 15 minutes? Oh, come... ON!!! ><
ITS HERE GUYS
i know cody will react to this so hi cody
Best video of all time 🤩🤩

i need this like once a month, holy moly this was awesome
So happy for jezxy glad he was able to find love
This is everything. I’m so happy right now 😭
STOP this was THE BEST episode of the button EVER! I laughed so much. I enjoy the usual button too but the behind the scenes reaction of the button operator was soooo funny
so you’re going to bring Cody back several more times, right?
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP!!!!
One of Cody’s all time dreams has  come true lmao!
The way Kody and I kept getting the ick at the same time, making the same face LMAO
this brought me so much joy!!!!!
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED IN MY LIFE
Jai is fucking hilarious, so real too lmao
Is Cody high on stimulants?
YESSSS  we all needed this <33
What the cody ko fans have been waiting for
ITS FINALLY HERE YOU GUYS 🥹
Moreeeee
cody finally did it! omg
BEST VIDEO OF MYLIFE I NEED 10 MORE
I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
OMG !!!!!
I never clicked so fast in my life
Am I the only one that heard someone in the background say Austin is the worst because that’s sooo true man
LESGOOO
I want Cody on the button from now on!!!
this the only button video i’ve ever seen on this channel
I love the staff in the back saying "he's the worst" about Austin
WOW, CUT BROUGHT IN THE A-TEAM OF CANDIDATES - ALL THE PEOPLE THAT MADE CODY CRINGE IN PAST VIDEOS ALL IN ONE LOL
can we block austin pls idk jus like not bring him on the channel again
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY OMFG
That was awful, didn't bring anything to the show.  Also Austin was very wack
this is hands down THE BEST episode yet.
ANOTHA ONE
Y’all recycling people at this point smh Also…LOVE Cody in this video
FINALLY
FINALLY
Congrats, cut. You got me to watch
Austin was………?¿
Damn he said she’s not physically attractive. Not even physically attractive to him but just full stop.
Fuck yes this is what we neeeeeed
“It’s spelled with a Z and an X” 😂😂😂 legend
I'm not 100% on exactly what it was, but that last girl gave me Jennifer Lawrence vibes lol
The collab we’ve been waiting for!! Cody was a kid in a candy store, loved every second of this😂
This is actually the best episode to date lmao
BEST EPISODE
YOOOOO! OUR BOY DID IT! ❤❤❤
NO. FUCKING. WAY. I LOVE THIS! FINALLY!
I am freaking out right now, this has been years in the making, I’m so fucking excited

This coming out right after I finished binging all of Cody Ko’s button reactions is crazy
This is just what I needed todayyyyy
Cody is a cute and awesome dude ❤
Can't wait to finally watch Cody reacting to Cody Ko Takes Over the Button
omg never clicked so fast. please make this a regular collab!
bro...
They done got Cody on da button
it feels like Christmas
AHHH HAHA FINALLY
ITS ABOUT TIME
best one yet lmaoooo
This is my favorite button episode EVER
Bringing Cody Ko on this show and showing the behind the scenes of the Button made this show a MILLION TIMES BETTER!
Cody!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
damn cody is killing this😳 the way he interacts with all the people, def the funniest button bring him back more often!
This was the best thing ever
Short guys personalities are weird. This proves it.
it's about time yall had him voice smh
This was so interesting for me to watch because we have the reaction and thoughts of the person voicing the button. I don't know would you like to try it out again with a reaction of one of you voicing the button? :)
Emile has been on this before they are reusing people
This is quite epic!!!!
“he’s the worst” hahahaha he is the worst
Now they need XQC to be in charge
Why did he say she is not physically attractive? She is not your type, those are two different things.
Best episode yet
this was my first time watching one of these button videos on the cut's channel and not through cody's LMAO
That guy who got cheated on by his baby moms didn't deserve that :(I. but I could not look away
MORE CODY!!
best collab of the century
good to know that the producers also cant fucking stand austin
cody looks so excited to be here its contagious😂
This is the best thing that has ever happened to the internet.
I NEED MORE OF THIS
Hahahahahaha the Austin interaction! That is f-ing wild
Having Cody on here is the BEST decision ever made. This is my FAVORITE episode now.
YESS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
first time i’ve seen someone out-strange Jessie 😭😭😭
Best thing I have ever watched
I’ve been waitingggg for this moment
Yesssss! Thank you for putting Cody Ko on the Button!!!!!!!!
IS THAT THE CURE GUY
This video could have been two hours long and I would've watched the entire thing
Y’all leveled up!!!!🎉❤
I have never CACKLED this much at a video before I LOVED this
Who let him have fun 😝😝
Finally,, I’m not even excited,, the feeling I feel is peace.
Did one of the peoducers say "He's the worst" about Austin?? Cause I love that. He IS the worst.
Always has been
Epic
please we need cody every episode!!!!!
Jesse wins !!!!!! 🎉 Happy for him but jealous lol he seems like such a sweet, good dude!!! Idk why he isn't winning EVERY button tbh!! 🩵💜
is austin a real person like why is he like that 😭
cody needs to react to this, this is meta
Cody is having the time of his life and it’s so clear 😂😂😂
i’ve been waiting for this moment
Best button video BY FAR! So funny
That last girl looked like Sasha G😊rey….I’M IN LOVE!
QUE
The only way this could have been better was bringing on Joaquin the astronaut dude 🤣 or the “are you religious” guy 🌚
Ugh I love Jesse 🥹❤️
I didn't like seeing the dude behind the button, all the interactions were cut by seeing the dude on the button laughing or yelling lol, didn't finish this video
I LOVE EMIL
YES FINALLY
this is the best thing Cody have ever done, i been laughing for an hour now
This is Dhar Mann all over again
best button episode
Can We Get ODABLOCK To Act As The Button?

Omg the time has finally come!!! This was BRAVE for yall to do cause Cody has been practicing for this moment for quite awhile. He might take over for good 😂❤🎉
Omg finallyyyy
Austin’s backstage comment was a reference to a Drake song lol. Surprised no one caught that
Wow I couldn’t love this more 🫶🏼
we needed this so bad
Yes!!!!!!!!! The internet has been broken You should do more Youtuber Collabs. This was the best idea ever.
YESS IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!!
IT HAPPENED 😌
My cheeks were sore from smiling throughout this video! It was also like seeing the Avengers assemble but of the Cody Ko-Button universe 😂😂😂
ON MY GOODDD
I’m here for Cody
Good episode - and definitely a good match 😂💪🏁
Austin was the villain of this episode
This is the best video I’ve ever watched
This has been the most awkward episode of the button ever. I loved it.
Not only have I never laughed this much at the button, but neither have the contestants. This was amazing. 10/10 am watching again.
this is the best thing to ever happen
"Not that." Idk if i would recover if someone ever said that to me 😭
W colab
My favorite episode. Hilarious
More of this please
omg I hate Austin SO MUCH!!!
Ludwig next🙂
women say the dumbest shit... "your name is like my brothers and its freaking me out..."...ok....
I prefer Cody Ko as the button.
There’s no way this is a real video 😂
Can Cody be the new host? I’ll watch every episode lol
Can’t wait till Cody does commentary on this one
this was my favourite thing ever
No way
no freaking way
the way my jaw DROPPED when austin walked in lmfao😭
That was the best episode ever
NO THE LAST TWO WERE PERFECT FOR EACHOTHER THOUGH
Full circle
FINALLY
Why is this the best episode? Its not even a contest this is so funny
The collab the world needed!
IM HONNA PEE
So glad cody got to match up Jesse lol
In the video he posted about a month ago when he mentioned he would love to do this I commented "if cody voices the button itll be the first episode ill actually watch in CUTs channel instead of only watching his reactions to them". Im a man of my word. Good stuff.
FINALLY!!!
Baldgaria lols
I want to be Jai’s friend lol
Idk if should watch this now or wait for Cody Ko to react to it 😂
WE NEED MORE OF THESE  YAYYY CODY YOU MADE IT 😂

EMILE IS AMAZING (and so f*cking handsome)
Bring Aba next time, that would be hilarious
OMFG DREAM HAS BECOME A REALITY, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT ACTUALLY ENDED UP HAPPENING
Ewww Austin is so gross 🤢🤢🤢
Lmao they need to let Cody and Noel be the button together next time! The chaos would be amazing
The fact that they brought in the most memorable characters from past episodes is so EPIC
I love how all the infamous people are coming back
this is great omg it’s literally watching cody
YASSSSSSSSSS

One of the best button episodes so far!!!
FINALLY
That was amazing! I could watch Cody doing that for HOURS!
Oh no not Austin...
Seeing Cody pop up in The Button thumbnail got me more excited than waking up to gifts under the Christmas tree
ITS ABOUT TIME 😭🤚
yall needa get ludwig next fr
Cody is a better man than me. I'd be saying the most ridiculous shit imaginable.
YESSSS
I need Cody on all of these
3 words... 1. off  2.the  3.rails... but hilarious!
FINALLY
Y’all should do more special guest like this!!! Next should be Moist critical aka Charlie
Finally, it happened.
I have been waiting FOR SO LONG FOR THIS!!
One if the producers called Austin the worst lol everyone hates that dude
Cody and Nut need to watch this
From reacting to moderating, Cody Ko has truly went far.
NO WAY
Props to Cut, well done, so cool
BEST BUTTON VIDEO EVER IN THE WHOLE WORLD. CODY IS THE BEST.
Can Cody host every button please
Cody KO × The Button. A collab that we didn't know we need.
Cody could genuinely decide to retire at this point in time and I'd have no qualms
YEEEEEESSSS
CODYYY
Finally
THIS IS AWESOME
It finally happened! No way!!!!
FINALLY!!!!! 🎉❤ YOU GUYS GOT CODY 😊
bro im BEGGING you, PLEASE make another video. this was HILARIOUS
It's so wholesome to see a creator as big as Cody have an experience like this - Like he got a special tour of his favourite show 😊 Then bringing out the regulars like Austin and Jesse??! Chef's kiss 👩🏾‍🍳💋
LETS FCUKIG. GOOOOOOO
Finally!!!! The day has arrived. It was so interesting to see all the things that the person voicing the button has to  do. You have to look at the screen to see how the date's going in addition to looking at the applications that they filled out to see if there's any questions you could ask them in addition to operating the board for the button. You really got to be a great multitasker. I secretly be wondering if they be cracking up all the damn time in the booth
Can this be a reoccurring thing pls!!
Pls do this with Hasan
OMG THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST FUNNIEST VIDEOS MADE IN THIS SERIES
BRUH I LOVE THIS
I love Jesse 😂😭😭
OMGGGGGG
Idk if I’m meant to watch this or wait for codys reaction vid 😭
This was hilarious! 😂 Cody completely went rogue! 👏🏻 Please bring him back to do this again sometime.  Also; Alex sucks. He’s giving incel energy.
YESSS
YES I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD DO THIS!!!!
Austin bruh 🤕
Happy for Jessie
PLEASE DO ANOTHER, this was so hilarious
FINALLY. WE'VE BEEN WAITING!!! We love you Cody AND THE BUTTON
Omg this is what we all have been waiting for
THis made my month
My favorite episode ❤
I was laughing so hard with Cody
I should probably comment wow Cody’s here so cool but I just wanna say I can understand why Austin is single
He needs to ask more questions to get convos going 🤧
Like a cherry on top of the cake. Great episode!
This is fuckin awsome
YESSSS
By far the best episode yet. Instant like and subscribe.
Oh god, pray for my man Jesse he's finna get pegged

We needed this so bad
CODDDDYYYYYYYYY

yess i love the last girl

OH MY BALLZ
This was the manic episode
this is the best episode so far, please hire cody co as the button!
floral guy seems like the absolute worst
NO WAY
I feel like marina(? The last girl) would be one of those girls in the olden days to get burned at the stake for being a witch but would go out laughing. And I say that in a completely neutral way. Idk which way to interpret it, good or bad.
Cody should just join the team atp
The most unhinged Guy and Girl in one episode and Cody. Well done Cut!
We’re gonna need this to be a whole series
cody was taking all the views so they asked him to partner up🤣
I’ve been waiting for this

The last girl is too much tbh. So she’s freaking out because of a name. Weirdo
this is literally the best button so far and i’ve been a fan for a while
I have been waiting for this for so longgggg
sending in a vote to let Cody permanently voice the button
I screamed at the top of my lungs when I saw this notification. This was the funniest episode yet!!! Great job Cody !
Was ROLLING when Austin popped up
cant believe austin kept saying "boop" every time he pressed the button 😭😭😭 brutal
Props to cut for plugging Cody’s song
This is the best contant on the internet

OH MY GOD
THAT GUY EMILE IS FUNNY I'D LIKE MORE SCREENTIME OF HIM !!!

the best episode by far. you better have him on this permanently.
The homie Austin never fails to make me cringe 😮‍💨
some of those producer questions / suggestions were wild AF lmao even took cody by surprise
Finally!!!
why does cut host all of these shitty men?
he asked a 400 lbs girl if she liked the gym? bahaha
jai is soooo funny i love her
Nah green highlights was fine, bro is trippin.
FINALLY

We are all living vicariously through cody

They even had all the classic characters!! Dope colab
Yassssss
best days of cody's life: - birth of his future child - his wedding - voicing the button
THIS IS LEGENDARY. cant wait to see cody react to this one 😻
"What are you looking for?" "Not that." GOD DAMN AUSTIN
best one yet
Cody, the Button aaaaaanddd Jezxie, all in one show, I can't! 😅😅😅😅😅
I'm 3 minutes in and easily the best button video of all time. Iconic crossover
I screamed when I saw this. Best of both worlds truly
CODY! This is so cool proud Cousin moment dawg! 🤍 absolutely KILLER 🤘🏼
In true button fashion, this episode turned the horny engines on.
12:45 they’d make a beautiful duo omg
Cody brings so much energy to the show! I love how happy he looks, truly a fun time!
holy shit!!!!! peak of cody’s career
The cross over episode of my dreams
That satan line was absolutely unhinged lmaooooo I love you Cody!
Cody you finally made it my guy 😂🩵
omg !!!! 😄😄😄😍😍 CODY BECAME THE ROBOT. 😍😄😄
FINALLY!!!! YES!!! Cody did amazing (no surprise there). I love that you guys gave him some of his favourite contestants (is that the right word for it?) too! You brought out all the personality types, lol. Ending with Jesse was chef's kiss!   Side note - I love Jai and I wanna be her friend. lol Jesse too, he's hilarious.
OMGGG FINALLYYYYY!!! ❤❤😂
THERES NO WAYYYYYYYYY AHHHHHH
OMG FINALLYYYYY
This is Cuts BEST video by far
WE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
holy shit what an epic collab
emile needs to be locked up why is he so weird
"you're just not physically attractive" WHAT THE
Ask them to do the 12 hour date
Please do more like this when significant individuals or celebrities have the button’s power 😂
OMG???
LWTS FUKCING GOOOOO
PS IS THAT GUY REALLY STILL ON THE PROWL
Well Cody, its all downhill from here. You’ve peaked.
Are you fcking kidding me right now?  This is actually the collab of the century but also Cut's self-inflicted downfall, as no other "Button" will compare moving forward
The way this was the weirdest episode ever
AT LAST!!
I love this for Cody
This was by far one of the most enjoyable buttons I’ve watched. Please have Cody host again
I just started, but Cody ko has gone on record that the button is too horny, so a non horny button should be an improvement. Plus the cut is going to get so much criticism on their own channel with this one lol
"I'm 5'8"  "How tall is that?"  ...literally he just told you?
Wow... Austin... what a character. This guy has to be a professional troll, i refuse to believe he is like this in a daily basis
YES LEYS GO
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH I HEART CODY BEST BUTTON EPISODE EVER!!! YOU SHOULD DO A VID WHERE U GUYS BRING BACK ALL THE WORST/BRUTAL BUTTON PPL AND HAVE CODY DO IT AGAIN XD
This episode has way more personality and is way more entertaining than the others. Please have someone with actual charisma and humor voice the button from now on!!!
Genuinely pulled an ab muscle from laughing so hard.
WTF
YES YES YES FINALLY OH GOD
Poor Jesse not the girl calling him psycho
The way Cody got super excited when Austin came in and gathered those cards has me in Tears XD
this was like the most insane episode
duuude this was so funny!! the energy was amazing, loved hearing the behind the scenes reactions and the 1-on-1s with the button and the person who buzzed, especially the girl who laughed her ass off at "because he got cheated on??" cant believe yall finally got cody ko on, and that it was so much better than i thought!!  👹𝙒𝙀𝙇𝘾𝙊𝙈𝙀 𝙏𝙊 𝙃𝙀𝙇𝙇 𝘽𝘼𝙃𝘼𝙃𝘼𝙃𝘼👹
I love that Jesse was the one to win when Cody is voicing the button
this might be the greatest video on YouTube
and they plugged his song for the outro :) we love this collab
CODDDYYYYYYY FINALLY
anyone notice that they brought people back on that cody would point out in videos omg
Bro. Boys we made it. Congrats Cody!!!!
Can't wait to just watch this on Cody's second channel instead of here...
No one is talking about Jai and she's so fucking funny
more of Cody as the button !!!
LETS GOOO!!!!
One of the best Episodes of the button to date. What a awesome collab with Cody Ko, glad it puts in perspective and BTS stuff that you guys dont usually show its nice to see that its a lot harder to make than it seems.
Omg it has finally happened
Oh my god it really happened.
BEST ONE YET!!! Cody needs to be the button more often 😂
This is the most unhinged episode of the Button ever and it’s fantastic
no way
WAR IS OVER
FINALLY WOOOOHOOOO
Austin needs to be humbled he’s way too lame to act like that
How is jesse still single he has been to 5 of these.
Cody should be the permanent button! He looked like he was having the time of his life!
HE DID IT!
this is truly the best button episode ever made
Please have him in on more of these
Finally!!!!
Austin’s repeated wrist flicks were a little sus
OH IT FINALLY HAPPENED
please can cody take over
I loved every second of this video 😂 😂😂
This was a star studded lineup
I can imagine Cody behind the screen kicking his feet and chuckling like a little girl 😂❤
lizzo 2.0 LMFAO
After all these years
Best button video and most of them are good. Love Cody and this was so funny.
Austin is such a dick but we all love watching people like him
iconic
Cody actually makes the perfect button 😭 so cool that he could finally interact with the people live instead of screaming at the screen and doing exaggerated impressions
ITS ABOUT TIME
o m g
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Noo way
At last.
I love that Jesse was on the episode that Cody got to be the button! What a full circle moment 😂
I <3 Cody
So more? More Cody on the button?
