lowkey bitchy going through Olivias room

Where'd you get the kettle?!!! I need
Talking about hearing ‘crackheads’ dismissively when you’re lucky enough to afford an apartment you’re really happy with doesn’t set a great example to younger viewers or other fans. Considering the extreme social inequalities within the UK, which are so evident in London, it would be great if you could refrain from discriminatory language towards those in need and unable to access social care due to a crumbling system. I understand it doesn’t come from a place of malice, but terms like contribute to a one dimensional view of society which vilifies poverty and drug dependence.
Where are your jeans from?
it makes me uncomfortable that the apartment is not organized
where is Olivias mirror from? x
partition to get lewis to move in
drinking red top milk is actually insulting to cows
When Lewis said “2013 Bethany Mota” 😂😂😂😂
omg where’s your top from? xx
She’s so pretty 🤍
I adore your video! I came across your channel and was interested. Thought I'd show some love 🧡 I have a channel too. If you could have a browse that would be amazing! 💗
Where are her jeans from
does anyone know what to ask for when getting her haircut :))))
So I don't watch this persons videos but it got recommended to me for some reason, and I just wanted to say as somebody who's born and raised in London and lived here my entire life, I honestly have no idea why you'd want to live here. I'm not exaggerating when I say London is a real sh*thole, I've been looking to leave for almost a year now and plan on doing so once this whole pandemic hopefully passes. It's filthy, expensive, dangerous, and so much more. Maybe it's just because I'm from the poorest part of London and maybe I have a negative perspective, maybe living in a nice, affluent area of London is great if your extremely wealthy, but I _really_ don't like living in London and I can't wait to leave. Best of luck to you Flossie, and stay safe.
It is a flat full of crap, do you have a toilet and a bed and a mirror and a fridge and a cupboard and crap and more crap🤣🤣 holy crap a wardrobe.
Who da fooook is that?
lewis's commentary made the video 10x better
Jesus H Christ! Do people actually watch this shite?
omg wheres this top from
Just uploaded a new makeup video on my channel called GRWM - Eyes, Base, Face - Skincare and Rose Gold Eyeshadow 💕🖤💋 I'd really appreciate it if you could give it a watch and let me know any feedback or advice you have! ❤️ Thank you 🥰
Very nice apartment 😍remember that Jesus Christ love you and he want to become the saviour of your soul
Where are her trousers from? X
36 on trenddiiinnnggggg
Apartment goals 😍🏡
"what about the wine fridge?"  "ThErE's A wInE FrIdGe!!!!!!"
Awww life's a struggle for you guys cool!
I love how they raided olivias wardrobe 😂😂
Look at me, I'm rich and all my stuff is better than yours will ever be. You are a horrible influence of young girls who won't achieve this. You are just showing off, shame on you.
Home town 😄
Seriously, who cares you self-absorbed strumpet.
Shame about the area
talking shit about homeless, disadvantaged people keeping you up at night because they literally sleep in the street outside your building while in your fancy new apartment at 19 rubs me the wrong way :// this video came off a bit ignorant imo I hope you can see how. You should be able to show your new place and not be labelled "braggy" and I agree with that, it's more the tone and how nonchalant you guys are about your extreme wealth. I'm a big fan and I'm not trying to bring you down, just bringing it to your attention. I'm really happy for you and Olivia please don't get me wrong!
#22 on trending yes girl!
Do video on sidemen u will get views hmmm...
how did you decide who had the bigger room like Olivia’s is so much bigger
my mum like does masages and theres this thing called hopi ear and you put this werid type of candle in  your  ear and gets all your ear wax out and yes using the white stick things do push it more in xx
Can Louis move in please
the british lana rhoades lmaooo
😍😍😍😍😍😍
it’s so nice. i’m IN LOVE with your bathroom and your views😍
I remember watching Flossie when she would sit in her room and talk to Alexa.. damn 🤣
i hate communism but watching this really puts me in the mood for heads on pikes
You got lovely home in London it’s not expensive to live in that area . Explore the Old city of England the Winchester the king city
The casetify ad sent me "should we try it again" "NO FLOSSIE" *proceeds to yeet her phone into the abyss*
Showing that view was so stupid people know where you live now silly girl
awesome 🌺🌺💜💜
i want all of this. amazing, modern apartment in london, living with my best friend and amazing views whilst taking a sh*t what more could you want
‘whell you dudn’t claryfy te roules’
this radiated such good vibes, it makes me wanna move out like right now
“It hasn’t cracked luv, shall we try it again?” “nO FLOSSIE STOP” I’m wheezinggg 😂💕
omgg dream apartament, i just cannot, i love everything about it
I got a floss ad whilst watching a Flossie video😶
What part of London is this? And do you rent? Cause this is hella cute for a rental x
I love you and your channel love John from Australia xx please stay safe
I have the same kettle and toaster lol
They must be RICH rich if they can afford to live in the centre of London in an apartment like that at 18/19. Even with youtube money
i think you mean trilingual not polyamorous ahah
its so weird hearing lewys speak normal and not yell lol
Lewys Reading all our minds in wanting to know what was behind the two white doors
flossie i’m pretty sure you have to bring bottles to a bottle bank and not just throw them out i’m genuinely not trying to be pedantic and annoying just looking out for you maybe just check that out i could always be wrong xx
she looks like Antonio Garza
i love that i'm convinced to buy a case purely cause she trusted that it wouldn't break when she was drunk

That sofa is so far back 🥴
Where’s the mirror from
Why is no one talking about drunk flossie throwing her phone around I died
Just a random one, but your bedroom windows, they look similar to mine and i think if you push the handle further up it will also open as a door. Not sure if urs do too but we didn't realise ours did so something to try x
I’m just curious as I’ve never lived in London’s how much would this kind of apartment cost?
LOL bit late
Are Floss and her bf still together or did I completely miss that??
dang the apartments in London are gorgeous!!!
my feng shui seeing her bed in front of a mirror :((((((
why did you go through every single one of Olivia’s clothing and literally ran through yours lol
Flossie: I kno what you’re all thinking.. where is that phone case from?! Me: not even realising she had her phone in her hand 😅
hello everyone Olivia and Flossie living together is ICONICCC
“It didn’t crack” 😂👌🏼
OKAY SNOOD🤣
does anyone know where her trousers are from/what theyre called? xx
you and Olivia are literary the only people that make that Castify add funny

Honestly winning at life
i am such a peaceful sleeper ❤️✨
It's the red milk for me😭
Where are the little gold mirrored trays and jewellery boxes from? Xxx
Not sure how much you’re bothered by this but you might want to be careful about showing the view! Could just be because i know this area quite well but I can straight away tell from the view what building you’re in and would hate if your experience living there was ruined by fans turning up outside your home x
RED Milk ???? 😂😂😭😭
Yesss💖 I needed a new video😓
“The bottom of my feet are yellow, that means you’re dehydrated.”   **Checks my feet**

Loveeee it

Love, love, love the apartment, but there's just one thing I wanna ask...why is the couch so far?
who else loves flossie xx
Where are your jeans from pls x
just chilling out in me box
Love! Love! Love! I'm so excited that you're living together 💕
i don't think i have ever been more excited to watch a video in my life wow
Love you xxx
Your room is the better room 😅 it has more closet space but then I guess Olivia gets the ensuite and natural light in her bathroom so 🤔 but I prefer the shape of your bedroom. It looks cozier.
Flossie going through Olivias room radiates absolute come dine with me energy when they snoop round the house man omg                                                EDIT because somehow a lotta pppl saw this: absolute shameless plug but I recently started a channel if u wanna check it out 🥺🥰
I’m so excited for you!! I hope you have the best time in London! ❤️
you aren't supposed to sleep with a mirror in front of your bed, i recently found that out. Apparently it can cause bad outer body experiences when sleeping and you dont sleep well xx
Yessss Flossie!! Love you💓
