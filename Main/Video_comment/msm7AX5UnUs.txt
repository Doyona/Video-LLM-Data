🎉🎉🎉
It’s ridiculous how beautiful you are. I mean you are so beautiful.
Congratulations my daughter and daughter in law went through ivf i have 2 beautiful grandsons they are the most joyous beings and mum and mummy are fantastic ,cant wait for the rest of your journey when you darlings are ready to carry or surrogate xxxxxx
God bless you Gigi and your husband and your future children! You’re going to be a great mother!
Poor babies.
gross
Hopefully you share this with those youngsters in the change process, openly share you did not take off your pen*s. Because many may want that opportunity to have babies . Be honest!! Your dudes in tact.. but you’re still a lady
You guys are amazing. Congratulations.🥰
I thought she had bottom surgery?
You should really campaign for Kamala Harris because Trump and his goons want to ban IVF treatments on a federal level.
Honestly it's hard to keep up with all the youtubers and creators I adore but I have always loved Gigi and I'm so happy for her and nat.
So , so amazing 👍😊but get your partner pregnant as soon as possible 😊👍👍
I never thought I would hear the phrase “freeze his eggs…”
And to think a large chunk of America is trying to take this away from people. 🤮
awww gigi i remember the sperm bank storytime from years ago and im so proud to hear all of you guys’ persistent and consistent efforts. congratulations gigi and nats!!! yall r gonna be amazing parents!! until then, i hope the babies are keep being healthy and amazing😘😘💋💋💐💐♥️♥️
It’s not failure if it doesn’t work!!
would you want more kids than 1? 😅
Wait it took 6 years or 2 years?
It took two years?
I love you girl.....I never pick up my phone ...im so bad.  You're amazing Yay!!!
I am very happy you are giving it your all.  You are very beautiful inside & out.  Best of luck.  Much ☮️ & ❤🌸🌼💐😘  Also my sister is a transwoman who has not gotten "bottom surgery"  she is 57 now and is feeling good.  She hikes a lot.  You are so real and cool 😁
Commenting for the algorithm.
Gosh! Really great argument for waiting to transition until 18 at least. Then freezing your sperm/eggs. 🤷‍♀️
This is real privilege.
Truly the best wishes to you and your family, I don't see you as much as back in the day, but I always come to vibe check every few months and and I'm just glad things are going ok for you.
Poor kid I feel sorry for it. You're everything that's wrong with this country!
Yuck
Poor child, entering your world of perversion
Disgusting
No puedo imaginar el niño que va a nacer de esos dos ! Realmente la humanidad está loca y enferma
That's crazy, so you can do all that, freeze the babies in 2023 then decide to use them in 2030. So you could say you were made in 23 but not born until 8 years later.
Yuck! 🤢
Congrats
Hi Gigi! Serenity here. Im so Proud of you and Nats! Congratulations! May god bless you guys with a beautiful baby no matter what happens ill always support yall ❤ Also happy belated valentine's day! Havent seen you in a long time been wondering what ya been up to! Fingers crossed all is good 🤞
I didn't listen to all the video , and I have been thinking about how to  accept yourself and your body from the moment you are born.  Maybe for a reason you are born in a certain gender and why to go through trouble to change that. And is it truly the right thing to do. I think the world is going nuts about this issue and most people forget why they came here.
Yeah that's what happen when you go against nature
because im chain smoking again and mama's picked up the bottle😭
Gigi you have the most beautiful arms. Seriously looking soo buff
Not sure why people are doing the most to have biological children. I understand adoption is also a process, but c'mon girl. This is stupid. Go adopt please.
Don't trust Gigi Gorgeous she will file a tax return in your name for $120,500 steal your personal information and use it for her own benefit after proclaiming to want to marry you and to spend the rest of your life together do not trust her . She will steal your identity I am going to enjoy putting her behind bars
Girl, your first time🤦‍♀️😹
16:37 This is utter bs. You can achieve things within given framework only. You guys just had luck. That's it.
Can't wait you to become a mom, best wishes nats & gigi ❤❤❤❤
“I tried for a real one” 😮
Not to be a negative nancy but the embryos still have to make it. Someone close to me has gotten all the way to implantation of the embryo multiple times and it doesn’t make it. It’s devastating every time.
Basically just average heterosexual sex but with way more steps
You did it girl!! Congratulations to you and nats 💙
Adopted children are "real" kids too.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Isn’t it interesting that Gigi feels healthier getting off hormones and let her dna and biology do its thing? Just saying.
omg my love im so proud of you guys & so happy for you guys ❤
SO HAPPY FOR YOU TWO GIGI ❤❤❤😊
CONGRATULATIONS ❤
You look so beautiful--the outside is gorgeous, but you are glowing from the inside.  Good luck!!   xoxo
You made my cry. Twice! B***h  ;)
Gigi, I found your youtube channel when a friend sent a youtube clip about your first job at Mc Donalds and we could relate so hard!. And after that I was hooked. I wish all the best for you and Nats. ❤❤❤
Congrats I'm so happy for you, you are an inspiration
So we planning a surrogate
Wow sister
You look soo beautiful in this video... and congratulations!  💖
Hi Gigi congratulations 🎉 I have done many ivfs but due to my age hasn’t worked for me. But one thing I would like to suggest is to leave a lot of sperm samples and freeze them before starting your hormones again. I hope you have success first tries of course but it’s always good to have a just in case! Keep us posted can’t wait to find out updates! Greetings from Clarkson Mississauga 😁 🙌 best place 🇨🇦🤣
Can't wait to see both of you switch back to your natural being and finding peace in nature. God bless you!
You two are both champions.  Both going through your respective medical journeys together.....the sheer fact you are still together shows the ultimate commitment.  So excited for you two!! ❤
Congratulations🐱🌷 you will be a fun mom god bless you both 🌹🎅🎀
I’m so happy for you guys ! Bless y’all ! You deserve it 🩷✨
this is really weird
straight pride
Straight with extra steps
So wait.... Are we going surrogate route, or is Nats going to carry? Either way, CONGRATULATIONS! 3 BABIES!!! SO HAPPY FOR YOUR JOURNEY AS PARENTS!!!!
Congrats been watching u for years so happy for u mom
Ive been following you since day one! I grew up watching you. 32 now. I am so happy for you two!
I thought you cut your thing
How much $$$$ was spent on this? The lack of self awareness is stunning.
~ SpEciAL ~ ✨
As a woman beginning my own journey to starting a family, your videos have been so inspiring to me 🥰🥰 so happy for you and this was a great reminder to enjoy the process. Been watching since the early days and you’ve come so far ❤️
🎉🎉OMG 🎉🎉 CONGRATULATIONS I AM SO HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU!!!!!
Congrats!🥰
So happy for you.  ❤❤
oh my girll!!! im crying for you! im sooo happy cant wait to meet them❤
Theyre going to have beautiful babies. Congratulations
i  am m2f trans and   Jody and  i  have 3 married children,  6 grandchildren  so FAMILY IS EVERYTHING to us. So happy for you 2 to be able to have your own famiy    -Kim
Who is going to carry the baby?
Congrats Gigi!!!!! So happy for you!
I’ve been a fan of Gigi for ages since she started YouTube and this announcement made me so surprised! I’m so happy for you❤ I also did IVF and I’m pregnant right now 6 weeks. Hope everything going well 🥰
Gigi your growth through out the years is amazing. So proud of you
Oh my gosh, Gigi!!! I’ve gone back to watch your fertility journey. Give yourself the gift of going back & watching those videos. You have come SO far. Your growth is incredible!!! The woman you’ve grown into, your relationship with Nats, your confidence and even the way you communicate. You are so elegant, so real and so open!! The child/children you raise will be remarkable people with the two of you as parents! I’m so excited for you both!!!! Congratulations! 🎊🍾 🎉
i tought you already cut your pee2, luckily you still hv it
I hope in one year's time you are out here as a new mom telling all the new mom stories congrats. x
Congrats!!! Happy for you! The body and science is amazing
I don't think it's a case of not being good enough, you know what I mean... it's biology.
That's one of the reasons that transitioning can't be take easely, I'm really happy for you both.❤
❤
Feel sorry for these children
So happy for you.
Get two surrogates and all 3 embryos can implanted if all 3 make it full term you have 3 kids.
Wait what you are not on hormones...
So happy for you
Gigi your action of putting your child above your needs is what motherhood is.  Also because your sharing your journey a lot of trans youth will learn . And a message to anyone who wants to transition , whatever you do be smart about your decisions above everything you’re overall health matters and also the future matters.  Be smart about your transition and remember whatever you do to yourself is for you to be comfortable with yourself , don’t care about pleasing anybody.  Good luck.
Congratulations ❤❤
I found your channel through that ashanty only you music video so like.. 14 years ago? I wasn't actively watching for a while but still saw what you're up to from time to time on Insta and when I saw this video.. like DAMN you've come so far! What an incredible journey, all the best for you and your husband and your future babies. ♡
Wow, so happy for you and your family ❤ Are you using a surrogate? And do you have an implantation date scheduled?!
Congratulations!!!!!!!! those are gonna be some beautiful babies!!!!
This gave me so much hope that i will be a mom one day thank you Gigi for sharing this 🥹❤️
Girl you have been like a kindred spirit and such an inspiration. It’s crazy how we are going through a similar situation. I’m a trans woman and am going through a fertility journey as well and it’s been rough. I’ve been off hormones for like 10 months now and have some swimmers but no where near where they need to be.  My husband is cis so we will need an egg donor as well as a surrogate, which requires a certain level of sperm. I just tested and I’m still low. So, I literally felt like f this but I was like “oh I wonder where Gigi is with her fertility journey” and checked your channel and saw this video and you gave me hope again. I’m so happy for you and your husband and I hope that our story will turn out like yours did. Please continue to update us because you have no idea how many people you are helping with your story. ❤❤❤
❤❤❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
CONGRATS GIG & NATS!
Before you even said the words, I felt compelled to let you know you’re so stunning. You’re so feminine and beautiful. You haven’t lost a bit of your womanhood. I’ve watched and respected your journey for years. Thanks for sharing these experiences with us; you may very well give hope and help to people going through similar situations.  As a mom, sacrifices are a big part of the role and to hear all you’ve done just to possibly create life is inspiring. Congrats and good luck
😂❤😂
We are currently going through our IVF journey. We are both male so we created embryos with an egg donor, we have had three failed transfers and have sacrificed all our embryos so we have to create more and keep trying 😢
Love this for you! All the best for your family journey!
I'm so happy for you two!!!! Loved watching you grow from the beginning of your channel! I can't wait for the future to just unfold and watching the journey come to fruition!
“Scraping the wall” god I love you Gigi always bringing light and positivity into hard times ❤
congratulations! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Pregnancy hormones have me crying for you. Im so so so happy for you and hubby, for this new stage of life for you!
Another hurdle cleared (since you said you are back in athlete mode lol). Congratulations!
Why aren't they just having sex...?
So happy for you both!! Wishing you health and happiness as you expand your family!❤
I’m a little confused is she going to get bottom surgery after the babies are conceived and born? Or does she never plan to transition
I'm so glad you stuck with it through all the sacrifices and strain, there's this African proverb - you'll know you are ready to be a parent once you hear your child's song. I think you must've heard somewhere along the way and that is what kept you going, just that knowing that you're child is ready to become earth bound is sooo SOOOO special. Much love and congrats to you and Natz!
THIS IS REALLY IT!❤❤❤❤❤
Yay❤
As a trans women who also wants bio kids, this gives me hope!! Congrats Gigi!!!!
We thought it'd be like, so easy exploiting poor women to give us what we want but my sperm has  atrophied so whatever! we can always adopt third world babies.
So so happy for you! Has she said if nat will be carrying? Or if they are going to use a surrogate??
Oh my god Gigi, I’ve been watching you since the beginning. And I know you don’t do too much personal videos anymore but I really enjoy them when you decide to let us in. I’m so happy for the both of you, as someone who dreams of motherhood someday myself. 💜 it’s been so wonderful to see your growth over the years. Thank you so much for sharing these things knowing that you don’t have to.
Omg gigi I'm so happy for you and Nats both
👍🏻👍🏻
THE WAY I TEARED UP WHEN SHE DID AT  16:09! 🥹😭 Congrats Gigi and Nats!!!! ❤
"babies on ice" sounds like a Tv show I'd see on TLC lol
Praying for a successful transfer!!! You’ll be great parents.
So happy for you! Have been watching since you reviewed stuff and threw it behind you at home
Praying all goes well!  Congratulations y'all! ❤
I love that you were strong enough to put your outward self to the side to focus on what you need to do to have a child. That is truly gorgeous. I have been following you for YEARS (since the beginning) and your attitude has always been incredible. You are a beautiful person and I can’t wait to see the baby! Love you Gigi!!!
My ex and I did IVF and the process is extremely stressful and expensive!  We had triplets and unfortunately it wasn’t in the stars for me because after being pregnant for 2mos I miscarried… the loss was traumatic but shortly afterwards my dr told me I wouldn’t be able to do it again and I had to have a complete hysterectomy… my babies would be 17 had I not lost them… the entire process/journey is again EXTREMELY STRESSFUL and anytime I hear someone going through IVF I’m rooting for it to go smoothly for them and that they have beautiful healthy babies!  Even though I will never know what my babies would look like, I’m sending love vibes for it all to go smoothly!!! 🥰👍
Yay! Congrats!
Love this hair
I’m so happy for the both of you!!! Such a beautiful story. 🩷🩵 I cannot wait to see what the future holds for your family!
If this isn’t the most millennial Romeo and Juliet story I’ve ever heard ❤
How’s carrying the baby?
I’m sooo happy for you and nats! Congrats ❤
This is SO exciting for you both!! Not sure if this question has been addressed in the past (I can't recall) but will Nats carry the baby or are you looking for a surrogate? I can only imagine the mental gymnastics that could go on for Nats when thinking about those changes in his body. Totally understand that may not be something you are ready to discuss. But I'm thrilled for you both and so happy that you were so successful in this journey <3
You can tell how much Gigi loves Nats in this video. So sweet
This is so exciting! 3 little embryos. 🥺 Yall's babies are going to be so blessed. 🥰
So, FYI, all male sperms are female. Only a females eggs determine wearhtet the female sperm changes to a male by adding the y chromosome.
Congratulations! So damn proud of you two and so excited. 🥰
ahhhhh
The doctor knew you were trans she was just trying to be nice. It’s common knowledge
Congratulations!!! So happy for you both ❤❤
God bless
Literally in tears congratulations ❤❤❤
I’m not gonna lie, I teared up along with you!  I’m so happy for you and Natts, Gorg!!!. 🤍
So happy for you and nats! Sending hugs and high fives.
So excited for you both 🥰🥰🥰
Mama Gigi!!!
So happy for you two ❤️ I have been watching you since you were throwing things behind you back aww
How does a transgender have a baby?
Are you going to have all three at once that will be so cool
Congratulations Gigi! I'm so happy for the two of you! Please make sure to stock up on food for the coming famine! You will need food, water and a means of self protection and a great place to hid your food as we are going from a Constitutional Representative Republic that was for the people by the people to a Socialist,Communist County ! The difference between America and other countries is our Constitution guaranteed our freedom and rights ! The only Freedom's other countries have is what is allowed by their government and that freedom can be taken away anytime their government chooses.  We've been completely infiltrated and occupied by Communist and Socialist and China.  The central banks are the powers and then the UN and the World Economic Forum! They are flat out telling you that they plan to Depopulate the Earth by Seventy percent of the Earth's population through war, destroying our farmers and taking away all of your Freedom's! I've heard Paraguay or Costa Rica might be a safe place but all of the Western Countries are under full-blown attack! America has enemies that have already crossed our borders by a lot! Our crops are failing and many farm animals have been destroyed and culled.  America has had over two hundred food processing plants and nitrogen plants and several other manufacturers burned to the ground! Several train derailments.  You absolutely cannot store up enough supplies! Our grid is also under attack and in serious trouble.  Biden has sold off our strategic oil supply that was meant for times of war. Given away our military weapons and has cut off our oil, coal and much more! If you're going to leave the country you should do so right now ASAP. OUR get off grid! The cities and suburbs won't be safe.  Every agency in the United States has been occupied even down to the local levels in every city.  I don't care if you're on the left, right or in-between because our government is after all of us.  There telling both side's the same thing and all you have to do is change the names . Trumps bad. Bidens bad. The left right is Destroying history.  This person did that or that person did this.  It's a divide and conquer strategy.  China used Socialism to divide and conquer.  America is using racism.  This group is racist that group is racist.  I'm telling you their telling both side's the same garbage and pitting us against one another because United We Stand Divided We Fall! Their teaching people to hate America and they are destroying our lives.  We must come together or else we are Finished and it's nearly too late.  While we enjoyed freedom and thought we were safe and trusted our leaders we were being betrayed! I cannot tell you how serious or stress enough just how bad things are! They want to take all of our freedom and make America a third world country and their doing it.  These evil Demonic people are winning right now.  Look up Klaus Schwab and the world Economic Forum and Harari.  They want us to live in fifteen minute smart cities and you won't be able to travel.  They want us to eat lab grown meat and insects and drink cockroach milk.  The food and drug administration has already approved it and insects are already in some of our food.  China and people like Bill Gates are in control of our food.  So buy heirloom garden seeds and get prepared because it's all hands on deck. No one is coming to save us.  It's up to you to get prepared.  God bless all of you!
Im super happy for you Gigi I cannot wait to see you and Natts shining and GORGEOUS parents 🩷✨ we miss you here on yt babes 😭😭
Congratulations Gigi ❤ your guygalthey bubbas are blessings!
im so happy for you Gigi🥺♥️
Can anyone explain to my ignorant self why they couldn’t do it the old fashioned way?
Giirrrrrlllllllllllllllliiiiooooo 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ohhhhh my goodness ❤❤❤❤❤ I am sooooo happy for you both xx I completely get what you’re saying about putting sperm away before transitioning. I’ve been on hormones for 4 years now and I do wish that I did put the little swimmers away too 🫶🏼❤️✨🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
love
This made me cry!!!! So so happy for you and Nats! I've been watching your videos since the very beginning! ❤
This made me so happy❤. Being a trans human we often are smothered by the negativities of the trans experience. Thank you for sharing this journey with us.  And letting us celebrate trans love and happiness with you🥹💖
Oh wow!! Congratulations!
it’s amazing, I am so happy for you ❤️ I think I was one of the firs of your followers here on youtube and I am just so trilled to see how your journey is going, wish you all the best!!!
Gigi I’m not trying to be negative but rather more informative. Definitely do genetic testing it’ll reveal the genders but more importantly it’ll let you know which embryos are “normal” and would more than likely take. Also don’t go back on hormones yet cause what if the three embryos doesn’t take….think about doing another cycle so you’ll have even more embryos to use if need be.
Ivf is such a long journey hope it works😁
sending so much love, positive energy, prayers you and nats ❤
adoption is beautiful!!! 💜
i’m so so so happy for u 2! ♥️♥️♥️
So so happy for you!
Her alpha energy came in when she said: when can I come in because I'LL PRODUCE MORE MILLIONS!!! lol
Omg, congrats
🙌🏽🫶🏽🥰🇩🇰💞
Sitting here crying with you!! 🎉💖 congratulations!!
Surgocy is human trafficking. That poor child. How dare you buy a child and steal it from their mother. You men make me sick.
This is wonderful news! So happy for this success for y’all! I am praying that the implantation step will be a success as well when it’s the right time!
So happy for you both 💓
I'm so happy for you guys! I already know they're going to be beautiful little angels ❤
Thank you for this video. Most important video to bettering the health of our youth I’ve seen. Period. Thus far.   That’s not a good thing. Because there should be more.   But thank you ❤

You and Nats are such an inspiration. Congrats, and thank you so much for being so open. 🧡
Do you feel comfortable talking about the next steps? Do you have a surrogate? How long can you wait etc…
Gigi and Nats I’m sobbing! I am SOOI happy for you‼️ Your children are so lucky to have you both. It’s true that the sacrifices you’re making now show this❤❤❤ I have followed you and your journey from Day 1.   I remember well 15 years ago that first video, opening it thinking, “oh he’s cute, let me watch his skin and make up recommendations” to now watching this beautiful fully feminine woman married to a wonderful husband with kids on ice! The miracle of creating a human is fascinating!
💙🙏💙🥲💙🙏💙🙏💙🙏💙
❤😊
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
Lifelong customer of big pharma
It definitely is a journey! Congratulations. I had a six year journey and am now holding my 4 month old.
Congratulations and my god you are absolutely stunning !
🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️❤️
Congrats!❤❤
This is a travesty lol
Yay!!!!!!!! Congrats Gigi, so happy for u and Nats!!❤
So the baby is going to grow in its "dad's" euterus and breastfeed from its dad and know that its dad was impregnated by its mom? Yeah you're both not mentally ill
Happy tears for you dear!! Keep smiling!
"your unborn baby is so lucky" lmaoo, Idk why that wording made me laugh
So happy for you G ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And now? Will they implant the embryos in nats body? Or will it be another person getting pregnant? And…. When? Why freezing them, why not directly pregnancy?
Congratulations 🎊🎉🍾🎈 you’ll make a great mom!
I have never come across your videos, today is the first day I’m learning of who you are, but when I say I BAWLED. I’m so happy for you and your husband. What a magical world we live in and how lucky are we to have this science and technology!!!!! Wishing you a lifetime of happiness and love, congratulations 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Congratulations to both of you so happy to here this. And you're 100% right appreciate the little moments because it leads you on an incredible road 😊😊
I’m so happy for you guys!!
Regardless of your gender identity, you will always be considered the father of those children.
Yay!!!!! 🎉 Gigi I have been watching your videos since the beginning and I am so happy for you!!! You deserve all the happiness ❤
So happy for you ❤
🤣 really funny, just go back to your nature if you want a normal family and a baby
This is so cool! Hearing about your story is really inspiring.
Wow - so amazing <3 congratulations!! You are so great :)
CONGRATULATIONS GIGI AND NATS!!!! This is so awesome. And thank you for the message at the end. Good reminder to stop and smell the roses every once and awhile.
we love you so much you're doing amazing.
I’m trying to listen very hard cause I cant stop staring at your face… Stunning
😭😭😭😭🎉🎉 omggggg
What a blessing. Changing your whole life is how babies work so you guys are so ahead of the ball !
I’m so happy for you both!

Congratulations Gigi and Nats!!! I am so happy for you both. May the rest of this journey be smooth sailing ⛵💓
Not me crying 😭😭😭 congratulations you guys!
Congratulations Gigi! I am so proud of you both! Been watching you for years and this is such wonderful news for both of you! ❤
Health looks beautiful on you. Geez Gigi, your arms are glorious 💪🏼
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
So does this mean that you impregnated your husband
🎉🎉🎉 congratulations ❤❤❤
OMG CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations!!!❤
I’m so happy for you and Nats! Congratulations💜💚
Omg 🎉 I actually donated my eggs to a couple in 2019 WITH WENDY CHANG!! We are having a facetime call soon to finally meet and talk about their 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER!! ❤❤ Wendy is amazing! She will help you both get exactly what you want! Best of luck 💞
Please before a see the video I WISH you didn’t bought a woman for surrogate, fingers crossed 🥹🥹🤞🏼🤞🏼
I went through IVF twice. It’s not that bad. Honestly. There are people far worse off who need to inject daily to stay alive. Having to do it for a few weeks at a time isn’t bad. I’m blessed my ivf was successful.  The worst thing about going through ivf is the mental aspect of it. The waiting around, the hoping and disappointment.  Anyone considering doing it should absolutely go for it. At any age
Omggggg yayyyy so happy for you twoo
Wow! Congratulations guys!!! That's amazing news 🥳 Have you mentioned whether you will have a surrogate carry the baby or does Nats want to do it?
Not you referring to SPERM as "unborn babies" jfc
I've been here since the beginning, I'm so happy for you g
I've been following you literally from day one from the start of your transition. I absolutely adore you and your life stories you share. I'm so happy to hear that you and Nats will be able to have a baby in the future. Seeing the love you have for each other is beautiful. You both will be amazing parents. Much love to you both. ❤️
Omg I’m so happy for y’all! Y’all will be the best parents ever!! I’m glad IVF is going smoothly! ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have actual tears in my eyes, so happy to see trans couples succeed in having biological kids❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations! On the outcome, but also in the growth through the journey 💕 One thing I thought of tho, I 💯 agree we should always do our best to reach our goals. And I also disagree that if we just try hard enough, we can always achieve them. Not in a society where there’s so much inequality we can’t.   Im not trying to be critical, or take anything away from your well-earned joy. Im saying this for this to remind people who may not have the same resources or background, that they haven’t failed if their journey doesn’t lead to the outcome they planned/hoped for.   I totally acknowledge that you & Nats have obstacles as well, that have made this harder than it could have been.   And also, starting life in the safety/security of a loving home in a safe country, is unfortunately a privilege most people don’t get, and it’s a huge marker for resiliency in the future.   And Nats having access to the resources of one of the wealthiest families, in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, is a privilege available to only a small percent of the world.   I realize that neither of these things is a guarantee of success. I do think the combination of you bringing those two things together, absolutely increased your odds.   With all of that said, I think there’s a lot of learning, healing & growth that can be gained by any1, who can use a much wanted goal as their incentive to do everything in their power to be their best, and to allow that & passing on their wisdom, to be their ultimate reward, regardless of their circumstances and whether the ultimate outcome 💕
💕💕💕💕
Spermatoa
IM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU !! CONGRATS 😄🎉
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 omg baby natz & Gigi’s you two are gonna make the best parents! Can’t wait to watch the journey continue to unfold! Your mom would b so proud of you ❤❤❤
I don’t know you personally but I’ve followed you on IG for awhile. I know your story, think you’re gorgeous and think you and Nats deserve every ounce of blessing a beautiful baby will bring to you. I found myself tearing up towards the end of this video because I’m so happy  for you both. Thank you for sharing!! Much love and Congratulations!
Not me crying with you😭 I cannot even put into words how magical being a parent is. You & your husband are going to be phenomenal parents. So happy for you ❤
"God forbid if I don't have a successful result..." no Gigi, God forbid you do have a successful result
If it so happens that you manage to "have a baby" despite the drugs and procedures both of your bodies have endured, tat baby is going to be something to be pitied indeed, no mother OR father, while being told they have both. I hope you don't "have kids," spare the world the vulgarities and spare that child the trauma.
This should be illegal ! Self absorbed people who think they can get whatever they want by asking a doctor to provide it should not make kids ! You can't even make a proper sentence  in your language!
Yaaaayyyy!!! I love Gigi and Nate forever. Been w Gigi since day one. Wooo hooo ❤❤❤❤
Your emotion telling the final number of embryos was so beautiful and now I’m sobbing! Congratulations! My wife and I did IVF and it’s honestly a traumatic experience.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lord have mercy and save us
Congratulations!!
❤❤❤
You are stunning Gigi!! This makeup and hair is perfect
I’m so happy for u both congratulations 🎉
This is amazing news!!Congratulations Gigi and Nats ❤❤❤
❤❤❤so happy for you both!
1st of all....CONGRATS to you and your hubby. I hope this isn't a dumb or too personal of a question but is Nats gonna carry the baby or are yall gonna have a surrogate? I really hope that was OK to ask
so happy for you and nats!! ❤
You have amazing arms!
When she said “babies on ice” I got a mental picture of babies skating around doing a show like “Disney on Ice” lol. But jokes aside I’m so happy for Gigi and Nats!!!🎉
It must suck not being able to perform your central function as a ‘woman.’
Wow amazing!! I’m assuming they’re using a surrogate? Does anyone know?
So what womb will the baby grow in?
Congrats!! Here’s to a little Gigi squad in the future!!
Huge Congratulations to both of you - wishing you all the best
I first discovered you with the kiki video when you couldnt even keep a fish alive for a day and now youre going to be a MOTHER!? Time really flies, i could cry!
I am so happy for you and Nats ❤❤❤
I’m so happy for you!!! I’ve been following you on your journey it’s brings me so much joy the know your going to have babies. I hope you and your husband well. You both going to be great parents ❤❤❤❤❤
When are you thinking of having your babie I am so excited for you both
Congratulations 🎉 Such good news and I’m so happy for you guys !. 🎊 I’m also pregnant right now as well. 🤰🏽🙏🏽 Seems like so many people are getting babies lately ! ✨✨ God bless everyone TTC & Who wants to be a mother or wants more kids 🎉🎊✨🙏🏽
CONGRATS🩷🩷
I love you both so much I’m so inspired by you!!!
Sorry but they are mentally ill people bringing kids into the world. Case closed.🤮
Congrats gigiiiii and nats!! Baby gorgeous on the way!! YAAAY! ❤️
Gurllll i have been watching u know for a moment and i remember when u came out as a lesbian and i remember how young and dumb u were and now my role model gigi gorgeous is growing up and becoming a mom im soooo proud if u baby love and support u always from Egypt ❤
u could have just stolen someone else's child like the right wing would have everyone believe we want to do 💀💀💀 anyway congratulations !!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE U <3333333333
Many blessings on you , your husband and future babies. ❤️💖❤️💖
Great news! I’m happy for you and Nats! 💛
Gigi’s excitement “yea I’ll produce more millions!” 😅
Wow I'm so so happy to watch this video Gigi I'm also a Trans women and I been taking hormone and testosterone blocker for probably close to 20 year's now and I'm in my mid 40's I know it shocking that I don't look at my age everyone keep telling me that I look 10 year's younger, but I wanted to mention that taking hormone and the other stuff my body have change drastically so sadly I can't produce any sperm anymore due to the year's of taking hormone so it does effect your body completely as a Trans women...
quick biology 101 refresher: A new, distinct human being is formed at the moment of fertilization (or conception) when a male’s sperm fuses with a female’s egg. both the sperm and the egg are alive and contribute half of the genetic information needed to create that new human being, BUT neither sperm (alone) nor eggs (alone) ≠ a baby. if you were to say FERTILIZED eggs, then yes, that is referring to the newly created human beings. embryos = babies (just super duper tiny and young ones)  again, it is only when sperm & egg fuse together that the new human/baby is created. fun bonus fact: at the moment of fertilization, the baby’s DNA and biological individuality, including sex, eye color, and other physical traits are already determined. science is neat 🧬
I’m so happy for you both!!!!!!
I’m so happy for you. Oh my God I can just imagine how cute your babies are going to look.
Wtf do u expect? This is wierd
💜💜💜
No hate but "No goal is off limit's"..... if you have enough money.  So happy for you both but please don't forget that about the rest of society.  Most people could never afford IVF.
I’m so happy for you two!!! My wife and I just completed our third round of reciprocal IVF (I carry her egg) and we are FINALLY pregnant after two failed transfers. I know this whole experience is A LOT but I’m so glad you two persevered! Can’t wait to continue watching your videos and seeing this blessing unfold! 💛💛💛
think ill be the oldest transgender ever to have surgery and hormones but trying get it started is hard because im 65. but im in the wrong body and need to be me and free
I see beautiful babies in your future, so excited for you two❤ Question maybe I missed and I’m just curious did you guys try naturally after getting l your sperm count back or are you using a surrogate?
Careful, sperm are not unborn babies.
Thanks for sharing your journey with us, Gigi ! Peace and joy !
Having you as a mother… rather be aborted.
Not being rude just asking , will y’all have someone carry the baby since you are not able to carry and your girlfriend will not ? Again just asking ?
I'm going to cry Gigi!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭 I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!
💐 congratulations! 🍾 😘
Such great news for you both!!!!!
Congratulations Gigi!!!!!!
Why are people normalising this
Congratulations 🎉❤❤
Can't wait to see her go from diva to mom. Such goals.
I’m so happy for you. I know you’re going to make an amazing mother.🥹🖤🖤🖤 love you G !!!!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SO MUCH SO MUCH
Congrats to you and Nats on this amazing news Gigi! Keep fighting like you always have and good things will continua to happen. "Nothing worth doing is easy"  =)
Iconic ❤
Wonderful news!  Congratulations! 🍾🎉🎊
So happy for you and Nats!!! ❤🎉
Get to the fn point! The video is so prolonged with irrelevant & unnecessary commentary. Stick to the subject and only the subject! Also, just being "Positive" isn't enough. It's not what made this happened, what made this happened is MONEY!
SOOO HAPPY FOR YOU
Never heard of you before this video but how cool is this?! 😊 Being this honest about your body as a trans person and in talking about IVF is impressive especially given the hate trans people are getting. Respect and congrats!
This gives hope to people who are going through the same situation
Adopted babies are real babies ❤ I know you were just making a joke but you of all people should know there’s no one right or wrong way to have a family. It’s lovely you and nats have chosen to try for biological children but please remember that adopted children are no less family than biological.
Damn i thoguht you wete alresdy gonna have one after doing that dog and giving reasons why doing one is good or reasonable freak
Everybody who is a trans woman freeze your ⚪🏊‍♂️'s before you you start your transition those babies would have been adorable
oh contrapoints is going to be happy, congratulations Gigi and Nats!!!
this is such a moment!!! like you said!!! omg how wild! this has been an amazing update. your glowing!
I’m so so happy for you both!! Congrats Gigi and Nats!!
Congratulations to you & Nats ❤️🙏 So happy for you!!!
Congratulations!!!!
8:05 also crying 😂😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This video brought so much joy to my heart. Wishing all the best for You and your husband 🥲❤️
So when can we expect a baby!!!
Congrats y’all
Poor baby, having a superficial mother in a world of a degenerate society that normalizes mental illness.
I am so, so happy for you and Nats❤❤❤❤  Gigi, you and Nats are going to be AMAZING parents. The amount of fight you both are giving to try and have a child is proof of how you will fight for that child through their life, and that is beautiful ❤
This is entirely wrong and against Christ.
😱😱😱 that is so exciting!! Congratulations!
So happy for you Gigi ! We love you ! You’re really inspiring 🥰
Omg I started crying this is beautiful coming from a trans woman going through the same process
I am soooooo sooo soooo happy for you Gigi 😭💙💙
Awe this is terrific and amazing news yay. So happy for you both. Can’t believe it’s been 6 years wow. I did think you made a video about this that long ago. Then again last 3 years have just vanished.   Congrats you two.
Congratulations ❤
You'll be an awesome  parent. You made your first sacrifice . By coming out of your comfort  and stopping your medication.
Wow congrats you are looking stunning 💗💋
I know y’all going be amazing parents
This is amazing! I’m so happy for you guys and actually started tearing up! (And I am NOT a cryer… well ok iam) much love and congratulations!

Many blessings to you both. Good luck on this journey

Thank you for sharing your story.

I am so excited for you both. Enjoy your time together both now and when your new little one is cooking. I can't wait to hear an update after implantation and a positive test. Best wishes
Been watching you since 2010 in the Avenue days. So so happy for you!!!

SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH AND CANT WAIT TO FOLLOW YOUR JOURNEY 💗
Congrats Gigi and Nats!! Do you have a surrogate or is Nats a sea horse dad?! ❤️🥰🥰
So happy for you both 😭😭🫶🏻💕
As a trans girl 7 years on hormones I’m 25, can you make a video how it was like being OFF hormones for so long, I will do anything to have a biology baby and I’ll give these medications up for my baby. How was it like letting it go and mentally what did you go through… I’m so happy is trans women still have a chance 🤍
Did you explain why you two didn’t try getting pregnant “naturally” once you were both healthy rather than IVF?
Gigi ! I have not been on your channel for so long. You look and sound AMAZING and sweetheart, you and your husband are so BRAVE. So excited for you two !
I feel soooo validated! Many people think IVF is easy. I’m currently doing our fourth round. We had a miscarriage. It is so so sooooo hard!!!!
Congratulations 🌸 so happy for you
So why hasn't Nat gotten impregnated yet?
Fingers crossed the transfer is successful and Nats will be pregnant! The last step 🤞🤞🤞
Congratulations
OMG!!!! YAAAS!!! CONGRATS 🥹💖
It was SO hard for me to focus on your amazing news because I was so distracted by those guns! Girlllll. You look incredible!  Congratulations on your embabies!!
Omg amazing news ! Parenthood is amazing ! Congrats to u both
Crying. So happy for you.
i’m so happy for you two. you and nats r gonna be the best mom and dad i know it ❤️
I'll get surgery next year. But I don't have the money to freeze gametes. It's sad, but I know I would be feeling worse not doing the surgery
I’m so happy for you Gigi ❤ congratulations!
So joyful sending you positive vibes and strength ❤❤
Oh my gosh! I’ve been watching you forever. So happy for y’all and I know your mom in heaven is so freaking proud of you!
Omg congrats, thank you for sharing your story with us Gigi you are gorgeous inside and out. Can't wait to see you as a mom!!

Waiting for video with La Demi❤
i’ve been watching you since i was little.. you basically RAISEDDDD MEEE HAHA. hearing this news makes me soo so so happy for you. sending you two so much love and light during this journey. i’m so happy for you two
The two of you would just confuse and screw your children up in the heads
❤❤❤
#manifesting 🍍 XO
Your Mom would be SO DAMN EXCITED to know her daughter is gonna be a Mom!!!
I still can’t wrap my mind around your doctors not telling you to free ball from appt #1. That was the first thing they told my dad in 1982 to get the nut rolling
You are amazing and have grown ♡
Congratulations, GiGi and Nats! I'm so proud of you for staying dedicated to this journey. Also, you're helping so many people by sharing this. Love you!
Since you have sperm and Nats has eggs, why can't you guys conceive naturally without IVF?
You can see how ecstatic she is ahhh I’m so happy for both of them! They’ll be great parents
I am so HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!! I’ve been watching your over years !!!!  YOU DESERVE IT ❤
Congratulations
congrats gigi u seen like a good person.
Love you Gigi, so proud of you and Nats <3
Congratulations on the success of your fertility journey so far! Wishing you both the best of luck for the next stages :)
Im glad you told your story i think it will help others who may transition  or thinking about it .I can say in these situations it helps to have money because without it  you may not have been able to do it on your own but you worked for it dont get me wrong.. Im so happy for you both.
Hopefully they will turn into a successful pregnancy! Will nats be carrying the pregnancy or will you do surrogacy?
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Congrats girl!!! So happy for you and your hubby❤❤❤ keep up with the updates!!!
Congrats to u and Nats and future baby/ babies. This must be such a happy time for you all.  I want to remind u how fortunate u are i finally was able to afford health care this year after not having it for 6 years. An IVF specialist would not be in the realm of financial possibilities to even go to once, not to mention all of the procedures u both had. Congrats again.😊
How awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤
im crying 😭, youll be the best parents gigi congrats.
What an inspiring and encouraging development! I'm so curious to know who will be the surrogate mother.
I thought she was gonna say, we have three kids now! :/ ,,, what are you waiting for now?
Wait?! “You can achieve anything you put your mind to”.  So those couples that it didn’t work for just didn’t try hard enough? Wow
Omg, I watched you when I was younger. I mean the start of your YouTube journey. You gave me so much confidence in my acceptance of the LGBTQ, and gave me the confidence to come out as bisexual myself. So amazing to still here and see you doing so well and staying so true to yourself❤
Ahhhh Gigi and Nats!!!! I’m screaming. Been with you since the beginning BEGINNING. I’m so so so excited. So proud of you guys for changing and trying so so hard. You’re going to have a beautiful family.
They are not "Full on real babies whenever". Calm yourself and reality check so you can make prudent choices. They are embryos. Only three *miraculous you got the three but..." have they had genetic testing? they may not be viable, then you have to get a surrogate and get them to implant and stay for a pregnancy.
I'm so happy for you and Nats Gigi
Hold your horses. You still need those embryos to implant stick and grow. That is a process. I would not start back on those hormones yet. Not before freezing a bunch of sperm in case you have to make some more batches of embryos as many people do.  I hope it works right away, but be cautious in your assumption.
Congratulations ❤️
Congrats , get a good surrogate....You're gonna be great parents
ROFL ... ok yeah as a BIO WOMAN this is INSULTING to us. Straight up like i'm so done with this madness idek why youtube is shoving this garbage down my throat. SHAME on you.
8:06  tell my adopted child I tried for a "real one"... That's Adopteephobic.
I'm beyond happy for you two!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤ Gigi you will be the best mom❤
No no, we’re not referring to bodily fluids as “unborn babies”. Terminology matters and this is the argument that the right use to eliminate rights
I'm sooo happy for you both
"Tried for a real one"is such a weird statement to say you'd say to your hypothetical adopted child
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉 very excited and happy for you both. 😊
Omg I’m so happy for you guys. All good vibes and a million blessings ❤❤❤
Yayyyy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congrats to you both!!
trans joy !!!!!!!!! It makes me feel so alive to share it with you. Wishing you both so much love on your future parenting journey (eeeeek!!! :))))))
Congratulations and you got this!
Embryo = literally a baby.  YASSSS ❤❤❤
Is annoying listening to rich people problems
I know Blaire White is happy. I know she wants kids. I teared up when you showed excitement to have viable babies. I’m so excited for you.
Congratulations Gigi & Nats.🥳👶❤
❤❤❤ omg I’m so happy for you
❤❤❤
Congratulations Gigi, you look stunning! You're radiating golden energy ❤
CONGRATULATIONSSS
You both are champions! So happy for you. Love that you have chosen to share such a personal private  part of your lives with us. Also, I am sure you are educating a whole demographic who would have no clue what the process would be for trans couples. Thank you ❤
Congratulations ❤
So happy for you Gigi 🩵🩷
I wanna see how natts   looks now
Love to you!!!
Congratulations! Gigi! You have inspired me to change my life. I plan on freezing my sperms and have a child in the future before I start my transition fully. You and your husband will be excellent parents.
I was crying so much through out the video!! So happy for you and Nats!!!
Congratulations!
I’m bawling omg
So happy for you both! Can’t wait to watch you step into your next journey. Been watching your videos since the beginning. Love you 💕💙
been with your journey since day 1 gigi! so happy for the both of you.
congrats to your swimmers!!
DOIN THE HAPPY DANCE HERE!!!!  YEAH....YASSSS!!!  FINALLY!!!  GOD IS GOOD!!!
this is probably a really stupid question but would it be possible for you two to conceive a child naturally if you wanted to / was that something that was of interest? I'm THRILLED for you both and I can't wait to see more of your journey  ❤
Congrats to you both ❤️
im so happy for you two <3 congrats
I'm so happy for you both! Wishing you both all the best! 😊
AMAZING!!! congrats I’m cryinggggg
congratulations !!!
Amazing! 😍 congrats. Now, I have a question, does Nats will get the baby or it will be via surrogate? ❤
I just love you ❤ so happy for you.  Your confidence is inspiring.  I want arms like your girl 💪🏽xx
Congratulations!!!!   So happy to hear this for you both ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations
So happy for you both love you❤
Congratulations to you both ❤
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOOOOUUUU GUUUYYYSSS!!!! god, those kids are already some of the most loved babies ever. the lengths you both have gone through already just for the IDEA of them is so incredible. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
Husband ? Isn’t Nat your girlfriend?
Congratulations!!!!  This is so great!
Congratulations!
So happy for you and Nats! Way to go girl! You are going to be awesome parents!
You are so beautiful Gigi , your arms are 🔥🔥
Congratulations Girl xo
When I say the wait will be well well worth it, Mommabear❤❤ just bawlinggggg over here. Soo soo happy for you both❤ YAYYYY BABIESSSSS😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
No idea how happy I am for you guys as a long time watcher and a mother who didn't have a child until 11 years into it so happy  God bless you guys and the little baby
gigi i’ve followed this journey from the start — i am so proud of you and Nats. i know this must’ve been tough and i applaud you guys’ strength and resilience. ITS BABY TIME!!! 🩷🩷🩷 love you girl!!!
I'm not crying you are.❤❤
I clicked on this so fast !!!! 👉🏾🖱️ i knew getting off estrogen and giving the 🍆 room to breathe would work !!
That’s amazing 🤩 btw gorgeous hair
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉
<3
Congratulations!! I am so happy for you and your husband!!! Thanks for keeping us informed!!!💞💞💗💗😍😍
Is no one worries about their lab babies growing extra arms?  Pregnancy is complicated enough.   This is weird. I'll say it.   Just remold nature, and expect nothing to go wrong. Good luck.
Ice ice babies yay!!! Congratulations to you and Nats 🥹
So so so happy for you Gigi x to follow you all the way back pre transition to you and your husband having babies is the best news ever. You both are incredible x love you gorj
❤❤❤
Gigi has the nerve to say “we tried for a real one” is a hurtful thing to say about adoptive people. Bc if someone was to say she is not a real woman she will cry transphobia.🙄🙄
You and Nats are gonna be awesome parents…that baby will have so much love….love your videos ❤
I am so incredibly happy for you ❤ congratulations!
Out of curiosity would nat’s carry the baby? Or are ye having a surrogate?
Congratulations!!!
YOU ARE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN AND THATS ALL TGAT NATTERS
Congrats! Science is so cool. So happy this worked out!
YOURE DOING GREAT
Gigi, I am so incredibly happy for you and Nats. This is so exciting. You all are going to be the most incredible parents. Thank you for sharing this with us! Congratulations!
I cried at the end. I cried because I remember watching the first video you shared about wanting to have babies of your own. I’m so happy for you and Nate.
2:00 she just called sperm “unborn babies”… what
Gigi I am so overwhelmed with happiness for you!!! I have been following you since 2010/11 and you have just grown so much! You deserve absolutely ALL of the joy you are experiencing ♡  You, Nats , and your story are everything ♡
oh my god i was distracted from your teeth the entire video, they look so pretty...... ALSO CONGRATS
Congrats to you and Nats! It's been a long road, but really it is just now beginning! Many blessings to your family!!!
i've watched you for about 9 years and i'm so happy to see how you've grown and how happy you & nats are, love you gigi♥️
Congratulations ❤
Ok so this is my first video. I'm new to your channel, I was brought to your channel by the video that you did with Jackie Aina. Talk about an introduction!!! 😂😂😂 However, your story is AMAZING!!! I can't wait til you post more videos about your journey. Thank you for sharing your story!! I love it!! I can't wait til gender reveals, baby showers, bday parties, family trips to Disney ( yes ma'am your family has to take a trip to Disney, this is non negotiable 😂😂) Congratulations Gigi and Nats!! Love it!!
Are you gonna get bottom surgery?
So freaking happy for you both!!! ❤
her entitlement in this is crazy
Congratulations Gigi I’m so happy for you and Nats ❤
Best news ever!!!!
So so happy for you and Nats, what incredible news!!! Your kids will be truly blessed to have such fabulous parents who love them unconditionally, can’t wait to see what the future brings for you all!🩷

Hurray!!!! Congratulations!! ❤❤❤ I’m so happy for you both! Thank you for sharing this very personal journey- I learned a ton just from this video. Also- you look beautiful!
I’m so happy for you and Nats, and just thinking about there being three Gorgeous-Getty children in the world, makes me feel so giddy and so happy for you and Nats to be able to take that step into becoming such amazing parents.
flipping hell! i’m so happy for you guys🥹🥹 congratulations you’re gonna be great parents🥳🫶🏾
12:43 referencing a previous video on this, I call them “moments” plus, it’s like a gender neutral term. As someone who struggles with infertility, I’m so happy for you!
Aww I’m so so SO happy for you and Nats. You guys are going to be the coolest parents. Lots of health and happiness to your little growing family❤❤
Congratulations to you both!!!
This is such incredible news ❤ congrats to you & Nats ❤ cannot wait for the pregnancy update ❤️

Congratulations! Very happy for you!
Omg congratulations 🎉
You & Nats will be amazing parents Gigi i hope the best for you two ❤😊. I am trying to have children too & its been hard for me as well but i am not trying to be upset about it because it'll happen when it happens or if i cant conceive it won't be the end of the world least my partner & i have tried.
CONGRATULATIONS!! You guys deserve it! You're gonna be GREAT
Congratulations to you both ❤
Congrats! Such exciting news for y’all!
Being pregnant myself, watching this through and hearing how committed both you and Nats have been really brought tears to my eyes. Every baby deserves the dedication, patience and sacrifice both of you have given. It’s a beautiful thing to grow our families and literally feels like a miracle when you see that first little heartbeat. What a lucky little one and CONGRATULATIONS!! 💜🎊
Ok so when are the 3 babies coming? Just get 3 surrogate women pregnant and give birth at the same time and then hire 3 nannies to help with feedings and all things new borns
best wishes for you both, my wife and i had five attempts at IVF before we got a positive result and on the day we did it was like a scene out of a disney film, not a dry eye in the clinic between ourslves, the doctors and all the suppirt staff, it is a journey which you'll grown into, keep grounded and I'm sure you'll both be fab parents
Congratulations Gigi and nats you both are Crushing it ! 🎉 I cannot believe after all these years of watching you you’re gonna be a mommy ! This is so crazy 😝 ❤❤
Wait so all 3 are definitely going to be babies..?! 🎉
Gigi has probably inspired me more than any other person on earth… she fights for herself and shows up for herself every step of the way… her mama must have been a good one and I bet she’s so proud!!!
I'm so happy for you 💓
Please come back with more videos I miss you.

Listen when I had to bring my husband‘s little swimmers to the facility, I had our vehicle not work that morning for what reason we’ll never know so I had to have my mom and dad bring me there with my little paper baggie it was so embarrassing but I also know what you’re talking about trying to get that in that tiny little pill bottle thing oh my gosh! 😂 can I just say I had an eye injury during it. I will say no more.
Congratulations Gigi and Nats 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Stop it right now!! Congratulations y'all!!
Congratulations Gigi! Gigi is looking so toned! Her arms…
This is just GORGEOUS NEWS. What brilliant news. Lucky baby. BABIES!!! Auch, just so happy for you both. Congratulations.
I have to tell you I had to pause several times just to cry. I went through infertility for many years, we adopted and then I ended up getting pregnant it was a very rough pregnancy to say the least but she held on so we ended up with two kids one day less than a year apart. Fast forward 25 years and my daughter and her wife just ended up going to the doctors to get checked up because they want a family. My daughter also has epilepsy and her neurologist said no, now it’s totally understandable and we seen it coming but to get that answer is still devastating. If either one of them would carry a baby it would be my daughter, my daughter-in-law could not do so because of her job. So now they are going to have to adopt & it is so much money to do now versus how much we spent 26 years ago for my son. It’s going to be such a long road still. We will get through it with love and patience as a family, my heart just breaks for my daughter knowing what I went through a know that feeling too well.  By the way, I am the one about four years ago that you left me such a beautiful message when my daughter first started dating her now wife, our family was just starting to understand my daughter’s lesbian side ( she is bi) and it was a struggle here at times, not for accepting but because my mom was very sick during this all and she was from a different time & she had dementia. But look at us now! My mom passed away four months ago but my daughter ended up having an elopement with their immediate family so my mom could be there, they are planning a bigger wedding in October of next year but at least we have the memories and pictures of them and my mom. My daughter-in-law‘s mom and I are best friends now, I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to have another family embrace us and us to them.I will forever be thankful to you and Nats, just watching everything you guys have been through through the years have not only made me understand things better but it has helped my heart. I promise you are here for a reason, I truly believe that.  I am so happy for you and Nats, you guys are going to rock parenthood I know it. Congratulations! I know it’s not an easy road trust and believe it’s long and hard but I promise after you get that baby in your arms that will all disappear. I wish you both the world and I hope all of your dreams come true. I again just want to say thank you, you are an inspiration to so many people for so many reasons but just know this little Mom in Las Vegas, you have helped my heart and warmed it so much. Sending you both a great big hug! 🎉CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS🍼
Oh my gosh. Congratulations.

You’re so brave!! I’m so happy for you!! I’ve always called them tadpoles lol.

EVERYONE CALM DOWN ITS HAPPENING
Congrats! ❤❤❤
Congrats on your little swimmers.  You definitely have that pregnancy glow.
You and Nats are going to be amazing parents! 🥰
Dear Gigi, I am crying!!!!!!!!! I started watching your YouTube channel in 2016, but for the last few years I stopped following you. It’s now 12 o’clock at night, I was getting ready to go to bed and suddenly I had a desire to see how you were doing. And you posted this video an hour ago!!! That is, I haven’t watched you for several years and suddenly remembered you at that moment! By the way, when opening the video, I remembered that I recently had a night dream where you and your husband have two children. I'm so happy for you! I know English quite well, but I even turned on automatic translation into Russian so as not to miss a single word! I am so happy for you!!!!! From Russian girl Daria with love!!! I am so happy Gigi!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
As far as I think you guys should go with surrogacy 🤔 I'm so happy for you ❤😊 🎉 lucky them 💖    ILY STAY GORGEOUS  ❤️ 😍
Just wondering cause I didn’t quite get everything.. Is Nat going to grow them babies?? Or is it going to be a surrogate ?
Is Nats gonna get the embryos implanted or are you gonna use a surrogate?
How will you guys go about carrying the child ? Nats or surrogate ?
Gigi no push of ‘you got this’ is gonna give us the money y’all have to go through this process. Some of us literally cannot afford to have biological children.
My husband and I have been trying for a baby for 1 year now. This vid made me more motivated to try harder! ❤
CONGRATS!!!!
I've followed you since 2011 (The Avenue days) and seeing you right now, the happiest most comfortable content human being is almost like watching a friend from afar grow up. You and Nats deserve all the good that is coming your way! Congratulations!!💜
Im so happy for you gorge!!💖
Love you Gigi ❤❤❤

I’m so happy for you!!!
We went through IVF and it was soooo hard. The waiting, the testing, the hormones, the surgery 😩 We were lucky and we got a daughter ❤️ Keeping my fingers crossed for you!!
You are the absolute sweetest and your transparency is going to help so so many people. You will b the best parents. Your little ones are so blessed. Can’t wait to follow your beautiful story💙💗💋
Congratssss❤❤❤❤
Yay 🎉
aaah its so good to finally hear the update so excited for you.
Thank you always Gigi for sharing all of this with us T__T. I'm going through a hard time with my career right now but hearing your words in this context still gives me massive strength. You both have endured so much for this. I wish more parents had more deliberation and intention with having kids. As a queer person who wants kids, this is super inspiring too. UHG so much love and high hopes being sent your way.
Congratulations Gigi & Nats! So happy for you both. ❤
Congrats!!! And thank you for being so open sharing your story with us.  There are many paths to parenthood for those who want children and every single path is worth it to bring a healthy child/children into the world, especially to those who want them so bad and will go through all of that to make it happen.
So happy for you!! ❤❤
I am so happy for yall ahhhh!!
So happy for you guys omg
Congratulations!! 🎉

Will you hire a surrogate to carry your babys?
Gigi!! So genuine with your intentions, that’s why I love it here

Proud of you gigi and nats❤❤❤
so happy for your family Gigi! I remember your videos from almost 10 years ago such a beautiful soul. xo
I cried.  I know you both have been going through so much pressure (medical, physical, emotional) to get to this point, so to see this video and hear your story is just the best news ever. Having watched -- and, in many ways, grown up alongside -- you since you started your transition, I have always wished nothing but the best for you. To know that this new chapter in both of your lives is finally opening up just thrills me to no end.  Congratulations to you both. ❣

You’re such a great story teller. It’s also been an honor to see your life evolve the way that it did over the decade that I’ve watched you on YouTube. Congrats guys ❤️ your future babies are very lucky
This was such a great video! I totally cried watching it when you talked about the 3 viable embrios and I'm so so so excited for your journey 😍
I KNOW THATS RIGHT!!!!
Soooo happy for you Gig 🎉🎉🎉 ❤❤ you and Nats are gonna be good parents ❤❤🎉
So exciting! Happy for you both and the next big step!!
Did your body change because you are off hormones? Because to me you look completely the same if not more feminin than ever so why do you even need the hormones…sorry I am not that familiar with everything🙈
I’m so happy for you guys congratulations ❤
Gigi I love you so much. I’m so proud of you, you’re going to be an amazing mommy ❤ Sending y’all nothing but good vibes ❤❤❤
I cried along with you and felt so happy. You’re iconic ❤️🫶🏼 so happy for you two
I LOVE U QUEEN :(((((((((
so insanely proud for you gigi <3 you are a mother to the trans community and it's so inspiring to see how far you've come. Congratulations.
CONGRATULATIONS
Been here for 12 years now and I’ll be here when your baby is 12! Love you Gigi
I’d be so interested to know the overall cost up to now. I hope they understand their immense privilege to be able to do this whole process for so long. So many people don’t get to have their families because of the immense cost.   Don’t get me wrong, I am ecstatic for them! I teared up with Gigi in this video. I’ve been here since the early days. I just hope they see how lucky they are to have been able to do this process.   Sending all the love ❤
Omg I came on here so quickly to hear your news!! Gigi I have followed you since the beginning. I am so incredibly excited for you both!! This is really exciting news! I love you so much Gigi!! ❤❤❤
Been watching you since 2007-2008...you're a year older than I am and I started my transition a year before you. I'm so happy to have followed you & your life. Congratulations to you & Nats <3
i’m actually about to scream cry in the middle of ihop. i CANT!
CONGRATS TO YOU AND NATS!!!! Ahhh this is such exciting news ❤️ y’all deserve the most beautiful children together!
Congratulations Gigi, ive been following your journey since the Canada days!!! So happy for you and happy to watch you grow!!!

Girl I cried when you said the doctor said you have swimmers ❤❤❤❤
You’re not cringy, i’m cringy for crying!!! I’m so happy for you guys 😭😭😭😭😭 Gigi and Nat baby 2024 🥹🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Congrats to you both. Life is wild and all the possibilities of it are endless. I had a strong feeling you guys would get to this point ,, may we all have the life of our dreams ✨✨✨
MOUTH DROPPED WHEN I SAW THE TITLE. HAVENT WATCHED THE VIDEO YET BUT AHHHH
❤
So incredibly happy and excited for you both 🎉🎉 You will be amazing, loving, accepting, nurturing parents.  I can’t wait to hear your next steps.  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
If you are planning to have the babies I’d recommend soon. What a lot of people don’t know is freezing doesn’t guarantee anything. It can still go wrong in essentially the “thawing” process. That’s not what it’s called but I don’t have the medical terms.
I also got 3 embryos and my second transfer is now 7 month old 🫶🏻 I did this on my own with a sperm donor so I fully empathise 🩵🩷
Omg congrats Gigi! 🤍
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Congratz!! Hope the only way is up and the new adventures begin! ♥
Congratulations Gigi and Nats!!!!! This is so huge and exciting 😊
I have been watching you for years Gigi and I am so happy for you and Nats!!!! Can’t wait for your next parenthood journey in your life!!! 🎉
Gigiiiii it’s been over 10 years watching you unapologetically live the life you have always dreamed of, and I’m so excited for this next chapter for you and Nat ❤
I'm happy for them, but I wish they were more transparent about how much this costs. It's not covered by insurance. A friend did this about 5 years ago (IVF with a surrogate mother) and it was around $200,000 -- and that wasn't a fancy BH fertility clinic. I totally hope it all works out, but letting people know what costs are involved is also important.
Spironolactone lol
congration!!!!
Omfg so beyond happy for you guys ❤️ Thank you for sharing your journey with us🩷🩷
Incredible news, congratulations 💕
so proud of you Gigi, we know this is your dream so congrats!!!!!!

I have a question how can a transgender woman still have spirn ? I don't get the process. I'm not trying to hate i just don't have transgender friends so I don't know really how that works
I’m so proud of you congratulations. Can’t wait to see baby Gigi’s. ❤
i am so HAPPY for you guys!!!!!! i literally screamed
Congrats Gigi! So happy to hear this!

I just can’t wait for you to have a lil one 😭🥲🥹😄😄
So wait are you really the dad then?
This is amazing!!! Luckiest baby!
I’m so excited for you!! ❤️❤️❤️🥹
First of all: congratulations!! Its incredible to hear that your long way towards becoming parents seems to get to the final mile. One rewuest though: please dont perpetuate the myth that 'anything is possible if you set your mind to it'. Dont get me wrong, im happy to hear it worked for you guys and i hope everything from here on works out, but please keep in mind that 1. You are very priviliged being financially able to go through that whole process and continuing it for so long and 2. There are enough people in this world whose health/ bodies will not get to where you got to and to indicate that they 'didnt want it enough' or 'didnt have the right mindset' is actually very harmful.
omg i was just watching ur dog givingbirth video & this makes me so happy ❤❤❤❤❤💌💌
