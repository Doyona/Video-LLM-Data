16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a blessed day.

Duff been crazy
JESUS CHRIST the king of kings and Lord of Lords(REVELATION 17:14) is coming soon!!!! This world is truly living in the last days, dont get left behind at the rapture and go through the tribulation, Repent and trust in the lord JESUS CHRIST today, he died and rose on the 3rd day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) so that putting your trust in him, he can save you from the wrath of GOD in hell. After the rapture, the tribulation will take place and will be even worse, DONT take the mark of the beast!!! if you do, you will taste GOD'S wrath after the tribulation at Armageddon, the bible calls it the great wine press of GOD, symbolizing his enemies bloodshed, no amount of riches can ever calm your storms, your fame and ego are nothing before a holy GOD, when you stand before the GOD of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, you better be ready to give an account, and be washed and sanctified in the blood of his son, which is your only way to heaven, you must turn and give up this lifestyle and become born again, and be filled with the HOLY SPIRIT, JESUS is coming to destroy the wicked, are you ready???? He is calling your name today for you to die in your current life and rise to new life with him, to grant you everlasting life(Romans 6:23) dont let this world and its evil agendas decieve you, the one pulling the strings is satan, but I'll tell you something, he will be conquered and consumed in the end after the millennium reign of JESUS CHRIST, for HE that serpent, that dragon, that DEVIL, will be CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE , where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever. (REVELATION 20:10)
