I’d say any medium van 🚐 like a ford connect van Peugeot or Dacia . Would be better than a medium car 🚙
great re-watching this in the ATG and TDC era
Before the gear
This feels like it was far longer ago than a year.
I've never seen such a hilarious van build video
Wait, it's ALL THE GEAR but on a different channel
I thought this was an all the gear video 😂 wondering why Edwin was on it
I lost it at the portalet replacing the front passenger seat. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The advert was so subtle. I almost thought they didn't have one.
Where did Edwin get roof bars for the E31??
Little did they know what they would go on to create... Bravo.
Lol, if only they knew where this would end up
The food makes it seem like there eating military rations
Brill vid, cool roof tent, tough little car, great combination.. New subscriber, glad I've found you, Loved it, thx
That 8 series back in the 90s only gangsters would drive this bad boy
i think that this is the one time that the £1000 wins
Back when this channel was good. Now they spend 50 quid at a grocery store and call a shelf a shelter it’s a farce.
Scrap the bog and lower the bed Ethan! Then you'll have cracked it!
This is better than all the new series of TopGear combined
Edwin's BMW is absolutely stunning, love that era of 90s "luxury" car, I absolutely need one it is sex on wheels
This is by FAR my favourite channel on YouTube
What campsite is this?
Ethan did this and thought, what is I could make my career online entirely around this sort of project and AtG was born.
Poster boy for testosterone replacement boy
Ethan has to watch his posture!
Liking every video that doesn’t collab with Alex
I get Jack's idea of a lack of a toilet in his vehicle, there is something to be said about having a poo outside, you're answering the call of nature, in nature. Just dont wipe with poison ivy
Jack's roof tent is a great design, the roof lights are a perfect touch
That brilliant camper Ethan designed is bespoke to Ethan. I don't think anyone else could fit in that bed lol
Should have kept the V40, it would have been perfect.
Id much rather be in the focus , great build
Definitely inspiring. Like that Ecoflow. The Focus was great. Just needed that rooftop tent. ❤
Where was the campsite?
Always need chocks when camping in a vehicle
Hey Car Throttle do still have the rally lights hood for the mk1 focus? I'm interested 😉
I would rather live in a Ford focus with everything I need than an 8 series with a temt
I've slept in worse conditions in a vehicle!
A BMW with cooling system issues that never happens lol🤣
An advert that i actually watched all the way through 😄
Give Ethan the roof tent so he can do a focus 1 week travel challenge
I hate sleeping in the car, for ventilation you need to open the window, and if it’s cold that’s not an option, starting the car all night won’t do either.  Better in a tent with a bed and a stove.
You guys recon you could drive  every single inch of motorway the uk has to offer in one single trip
Edwin is a legend the combo of him, Jack and Ethan is the best era of CT
Fake and staged dialogs.. to promote AD for sleeping tent and battery.. pff
Really like the 8 series, but I'm biased because I own one, Rj in Oz
Ethan smashed it 🤣💪
Unsubscribing, RIP Car Throttle @autocaralex
What happened to alex
Such a good episode! I want that Focus!
That is my favourite BMW all time, ever. And I own a beemer which I love.
Yes Charlie! Levelling up with this one! Fantastic endorsement. Great product and the ideal camping accessory. Much love brother 👊🏼
where is Alex?...
So, what you're saying is, of you combined the focus with the tent. You'd have the perfect micro camper!!
That was as smooth as Chris Harris "oh yeah it goes round a corner" 😂😂
you know what, stick a roof tent on top of the focus and it's be a pretty legit camper. well, as long as you have access to an actual toilet, that is!
Are the seams on that roof tent full of holes ?
“What the bloody hell is that noise” 😂😂
Fucking hellll boys I’m loving the content
Done well without Alex, actually better boys love it
Blokes have watched their Top Gear shows..and that is only a goood thing
Can we please see more of that beautiful 8 series!
clearly all Ethan needs to make that camper perfect is a C-Max instead of a Focus, bed issues solved
Im so happy I can watch CT again, I couldn't fucking stand Alex, good riddance and please never bring him back.
Hocus pocus my mate has shat in me Focus...
Would ethans entertainment area not have doubled as hes sleeping arrangements? he also has a tv there to watch some tv before he sleeps. The focus without the toilet and a tent on the roof would be perfect. nice little economical car too. Easy to fix. Cheap to run.
the drill cutaway sound effects are quite annoying
06:33 - What are those window curtains? Asking for a friend
The new trio works brill, more of the mad lads pls
Car throttles the best it's ever been
red sauce in a bacon sarney? 🤢🤢🤮. Brown sauce, White bread, and proper butter.
Great video chaps. Ethan, not trying to be mean but you really need to improve your posture 😢
putting tomato sauce on a bacon sarnie!!! really...  decent effort Ethan
This reminds me of that one top gear episode
So glad to see the Focus back!!!
nice, but it's a bit weird without Alex. anyway, best of luck! I'll keep following
Edwin’s car collection is top class, however his posture and the way he walks around troubles me, I’m happy to chip for a chiropractor.
You’ve done that already. Shows just not the same without Alex sorry but true
Subaru outback with a pop top roof like the one on the vw micro van
Bmw 330D motor 3000 de 204cv año 2005 manual? Video pliisss
Not gonna lie, I'm getting old and more tempted by a van to convert than anything fast.
Ethan has absolutely outdone himself!
Frank v Eddie, who wins ?
I need those curtains on the front doors
Epic job ethan haven't laughed so hard in ages 😂
"if it makes you feel any better, it looks more comfortable than your bed" 😂😂
Love you guys but this was a shit episode 😂
The shitting position broke me 😂 well done boys another decent bit of content.
A European road trip. Take both cars. Sleep in the roof tent and everything else in the Ford.
wheres the porsche
this focus made me buy a yellow focus mk1 and save it from scrap and its fantastic                   thanks you guys your focus is so rare because is a X reg they were all W   //// nice vid guys your vids are always good
I sell eco flow at my work 🎉
Another great video, thanks for sharing!
Jack your jacket is fire🔥🔥🔥 14:11  i need one too. Where did you get it?
love ethan his absolutely amazing and is doing so well with Jack n Edwin his ideas with TV n deck chair amazing
I’m the guy with the rear ended mx5 I just bumped into you guys at silver lake and just wanted to say you guys slate awesome
Car throttle is just not the same anymore with out the original people.
Funniest episode in a long time. I watched this at work during a break and annoyed my colleagues due to laughing so much and so loudly 😂
genius.
What's the smallest car that tent would fit on? Smart car?
Ethan really made the top gear boys look like fools with his camper 😂
That Green Paint on the milennium edition focus is nostalgia, straight up nostalgia
I want that roof tent on my gti
Awesome episode, keep it up
Tool box filled with fairy lights 😂😂😂never change Ethan
Edwin and his cars!! Wow 🤩 proper car guy props to him
Nice to see the focus still available
Noticed the lads are using walkie talkies to communicate. Does anyone know if this is allowed? All I can read online is that built CB radios are fine but I'd have thought Walkie Talkies would be classed as hand held. Going on a trip myself and want to use them to keep in touch with the group but worried about getting pulled by police. Especially as one lad has just passed his licence.
That kept me glued to your content from start to finish keep up the good work guys 😅
Still love you lads - a real treat when I see your vids appear.  Which is strange because you just talk bollocks for twenty minutes!
It's amazing aside from being an 8 series with a roof tent. The kind of knob who would do that 🤣 atleast j got my tent for when I'm on the side of the road lol
Top Job Chaps 🤘
7:05 very well done 👍👍
I never wanna hear Ethan slander of any kind again, apart from the high up bed, he absolutely smashed it out the park here, well and truly 👏
Alex needs to come back😕remember the air refreshers and heated seats
Ethan's was good he had a television a games console a cooker where he can make some food too eat his bed wasn't good enough for sleeping Jack's car tent was awesome he got a good night's sleep but he had too eat the food Ethan made for him.
Clunk click, every shit.
I’ve actually taken a few ideas away from Ethan’s micro camper for my own camper van 😂
I don’t think I’d want to take a reclined 💩 it would fall backwards and hit your cheeks 😂
Gutted you filmed up beachy head and I missed you chaps! The roads I learnt to drive on and there absolutely fantastic! My home town glad to see it getting some great press 😊
If you just move the roof tent to the Focus, with an awning over the boot area, basically flawless. 🤔🤣
Ethan, you truly surpassed yourself there buddy. Good effort. 🎉
Anybody else think this channel has gotten 10x better since Alex left? I enjoy his content but it basically the Nurburgring shitbox simulator
That roof tent had many daylight holes 😮
Fed on grass, that should be the name of the steak sandwiches
I wasn’t expecting much from this video but it delivered so many laughs! I love the dynamic between you guys
Looks class
Why didn't he just turn the lounge bit into a bed as well instead 😂
Yell you what if I had a camper I'd get that battery pack
I dream of owning a 850
Still feels off without Alex
Ethan is Inspector Gadget. Utter genius 👍
why didnt he just take out the passenger seat
Totally lost it when Ethan showed that screen. What an episode chaps!
Someone has been shopping in Aldi!! 10:56
let the challenge begin 😮🔥
You guys are living life as it should be lived
I've said it before and I'll say it again - the chemistry between you lads in on point. Way better now that the other guy (what's his name?) has left. Good vibes chaps.
Didn't you guys do this before? Or do I remember someone else?
Dunno what Ethan was thinking with that bed, otherwise it was great
Genuinely great episode
Don't they sell swags in England? Ohh no a country with no dangerous wildlife why not sleep outside the car?
Wicked stuff, but Ethan needs to sort his posture 😬
Clunk click, every shit.
Completely agree, sugar free tomato ketchup needs to do one 😅
Now, do it with a Miata.
Spent the entire video pretending that gas stoves and inverters don't exist. Still always love the great content guys, I understand you need to get paid.
Ethan knocked it out of the park, if there was one I would do is get a latrine tent and put the toilet in there and out of the car and lower the bed height.
That delta 2 surely costs more than the focus 😂
Well done Nathan your camper Focus had evertthing except a decent bed needs some fine tuning
I’m crying this was too good 😂🤣
❤😊😊❤❤
Good job Ethan 👏 Remove the toilet and front seat. BMW'S are endless money pits. Its nice car. But I wouldn't want the cost of the maintenance. I  liked the roof tent.
i do car camping in a back of a 2022 toyota corolla as a wheelchair user, best thing i've decided to do
That 8-series looks amazing!!!
Weird seeing you guys drive through my hometown
Can we have a garage tour of car throttle staff 😂
I don't know how much you're paying these three but it isn't enough.
The millenium edition! It's back!
That's my fav road 😂 beachy head.
Hows Ethans back?  Has he been to a Dr and gotten some spine scans? Correct it while he is young.
The E31 8 Series is such a good looking car
Nasty editing, too many effects, not enough dynamic range. Content itself is great as usual.
I'm surprised Ethan didn't turn where he was playing Mario kart into a bed that would have been more comfortable I'd imagine if done properly rather than a couple of cushions to sit on
Pure entertainment !
Is that the same camp site that Al, Chris and Boothy stayed at in the Budget Bike Battle of Britain, or am I just wishing it was?
Tomato ketchup on a bacon sandwich is a crime against humanity.🤮🤮🤮🤮
I genuinely lost it at the toilet. Ethan is a treasure who must be protected at all costs
Always prioritise a good bed over having a toilet. There’s always a bush to go behind 🤷‍♂️
Wow he done really good with that ford
Say no more it is a BMW
I power my Defender camper with an Ecoflow, great bits of kit.
The stress of sitting in traffic in an overheating car is like nothing else. You are also baking hot because you have the heater on full blast to try to save the engine.
man I'd just use a tent :)
Please put a popup roof on the focus!
Hi guys. Love your work 👍
Ethan’s design was legendary 😂
Should have removed the whole passenger seat and lowered the bed down and the focus would have been perfect
other than the bed, Ethan just knocked it out of the park this time.  [invisible hat tilt to Ethan]
Epic guys!
Nooo way you guys were literally 5mins walk away from my house!!!! Would have loved to see the micro camper in real life 😂
That was entertaining. :)
Have I missed something with the Porsche?
Great video as always
Great video Lads. 👍
Please stop the flashing transitions omfg, what are you thinking
Oh man. This was hilarious. This is better than peak quality Top Gear. Love it boys.
You guys need to do another roadtrip pleaseee
I feel like Ethan could've had a better sleep if he moved his drivers seat all the way forward, reclined the rear seat, and just slept there
That's a DC port..
The jacket! Is that an Alonso Renault jacket??
I’ve always loved this generation of Focus.
The focus is genuinely ingenious but the compromises required are hilarious 😅😆 Amazing job though, absolutely love how many amenities are stuffed in there
Edwin's 8 series is mint, more on the oxford green m3!
Playing GTA Vice City out camping hell yeah!!!
I want to see you combine the idea with a practical option, something like a high mileage mid sized suv...
The vibe on these videos is so nice, it’s everything I want from a car channel, keep it up boyz
2:22 driving on the wrong side?
Just incline the driver's seat and sleep there in the back… not the goof of lying in the dead space
Ethan's whip is genuinely dope
Ethan went all in with that Focus. That's sick.
They had me at Mario Kart.
Car throttle is like the modern top gear!!!!!
Bloody good job Ethan
A boot bacon sandwich? Surely it’s called a bacon boottie!
That Ketchup is dog shit!! Made that error myself!!
Isn’t the 840ci roof weight limit like 75kg? How does it not fold like a red hot mars bar with someone in it, fair play 😂
The Focus is amazing Ethan 😂
All thay doing is the old top gear same as autoalex fair enough thay get views but it was over 10 years ago on bbc when thay had Clarkson May and Hammond
Ethan's work with the Focus is simply amazing! Happy to see him so excited about a car project too!
great video lads great fun . However do you really know how rare the Ford focus millemnum is ? .They only made 1000 of them and there are prob less than 200 left on the road . That car needs to be restored  asap .
gotta love ethans ingenuity xD
This episode was goddamn brilliant. I absolutely lost it when he pulled the TV out of the back and when they started sanding the car. Great work team
That looks like you had a great laugh:)
If this was going be the idea from the start before the 500 I think Ethan should of got a focus or Mondeo estate fit loads more in for this challenge or better yet get a tentbox on top of the focus it wud be perfect
3/10 for the bacon sarnie.  Not enough bacon, and it looks like the liquid fat wasn’t shook off before it went onto the bread which makes it too soggy. It really could have done with egg in there too.   Worst crime of all was using Ketchup, must be a southern thing. Real men use brown sauce
Bmw 8 series jeeeez
'You can recline' at which point I lost my ....  Great vid lads.
Loving these ct vids guys more then ever keep it up
Let’s go golfing
Fully giving old Top Gear vibes 🤌🏻❤️
Micro camper budget build and survive a full weekend. With an independent judge to review the campers a budget £1500/£2000 each, including buying the vehicle. Jack and Edwin will be scared of Ethan’s skill.
Has a hint of an old top gear this one lads. 😄
I'm actually interested in the sponsor of this video I love solar related stuff...
Glad to see a return of the Focus, don’t know how Ethan slept like that.
Can you save my car from going to the scrapyard?
RARE ETHAN W
Genius !!!
18:17 is it just me that thought that was Mark mecanns house 😂
You are srewed whitout Alex mates!
Ethan stole my chopping board, I'm informing HR.
*Caa throol*
Ethan has won the internet today
Fucking class video, well in boys!
How did you forget.on the 13/07/23. Focus failed its mot.guess on what.you guessed it.wind screen wipers.how did you forget.not ti change the wipers.lol.😅
Smashed it Ethan 🔥
Ethan, you should patent the shitter and call it a carzee
That Focus is clutch!
I've watched countless of car channels on YouTube and TV but none compare to car throttle 😂
That focus is amazing!
Ethan's driving his Banana Hammock!
*£1200+ for a battery pack? Fcuk that.*
I have had a @latitudetents for two years on my estate and now on my van, it's brilliant! Absolutely love the way the channel is going 👌🏻
Brilliant so funny... focus is the new camper vehicle 🚐.. lower the bed 😂
I thought when Alex left CT it would go downhill but these kind of videos are really good!
Ethan you are the new star
Hilarious….keep up this content up!
Been watching CT for many years, still fantastic watching, and still love Jack's laugh!
Glad to see Ethans wood is still in business
Don’t suppose Edwin wants an E46 in a fairly rare combo? Imola Red, 330Ci, Manual 😂
That 8 series is beautiful
How much percent did the power station end up at after doing all that stuff?
Ethan's effort to this video made me so happy
Hilarious all the way through, absolutely loves this one. Makes me want to spend 25 hours on a hatchback and turn it into a house
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.... out of the back of your Focus
Love the banter and the direction you've taken car throttle 👍👏👏
Been carcamping for years, and that Focus is legit bloody impressive! Expected chaos, got absolut genius level of ingenuity.
Ethan, you are a *******star😂 This is brilliant !
TBH, after setting up my tent and food the next thing I do is clean my 'bike when I go off camping so I can empathise with getting the DA out!
great
I think Ethan takes the (yellow) cake but I wouldn't mind a roof tent. It's been a thing for us east germans for ages and I love em.
This channel is cool again
CT is on a roll lately. So entertaining.
Best vid yet
Great challenge. Ethan had some quite clever ideas for his micro camper and some quite sh1t ones too! Best of all though, was the banter!
This channel has never been better imo. Feels like it’s thriving, and these 3 really bounce off each other well. Really enjoying this channel lately more than ever.
shocking when they SPEND money on shocks vs getting them for free they don't use BC racing coilovers lol
Genius episode. Ethan rolling out of the bed had me crying of laughter.
Our EcoFlow pro has been supplying us with power for a good year now. It literally runs our house (on wheels). 😉
They sure don't make beemers as handsome as they used to
any car that edwin seems to daily is a lovely motor. mans got taste.
I think jack was right, get rid of the storage in the focus and just make the bed a hell of a lot lower so your not breathing on the sunroof😂
You three have gotten in such a good flow with your latest videos.  There's a whiff of Clarkson, Hammond and May here and you're worthy successors.
Is that the same camp site they went to in budget bike battle
My god those 8 series are just such good looking cars.
Stayed at that campsite before. Got kicked out for doing doughnuts.
This is great, would be even better with Alex, he would’ve been ripping into both Ethan and the car on just about anything and everything
When you order topgear from wish
Good topical sponsor! Ethan gave everything for this one, even his sleep quality
Hold the phone, how have you got mayo but no brown sauce with your bacon?!
I un-liked this video as soon as you put red sauce on that bacon and not brown sauce 😂
Quality job on the passenger throne😂 I’ve got one of the latitude pioneer tents actually and I can’t recommend them enough!! He wasn’t lying about the good nights sleep in the tent as I’ve said before I prefer sleeping in the latitude tent than I do at home😂😂
You three are killing it, well done!
When i think about it, it's hard to imagine something more well suited for this kind of thing than that 8 series (Provided that it is actually working). The tent might not exactly match the luxurious feel of a good GT, but can you imagine that for taking a trip up to explore the scottish highlands
This is brilliant 😂 Top gear campervan challenge part 2
That Ecoflow system seems to be the difference between carry on camping and glamping, super idea, another enjoyable vide gents, thank you.
why not just make the bed where the living room area was just cut up a mattress and lay it down with a cushion your sorted
Wow...I have a Focus SW from that era... Already has the roof bars... Would be the perfect mix of both this campers
The videos in recent months have been just epic. Some of the best content the channel has ever produced. Well done chaps
14:45 please tell me that's a vine reference from back in the day from Edwin 😂
Great video lads 😂 now top gear is gone, you are it lol
The wrench noises make it 😂
I think I actually love Edwin!
Can someone inform me where the renault f1 jacket is from?
Best video ever, Ethan getting into bed  killed me😂😂
Eastbourne 🤙🏻
Amazing video lads. Brilliant stuff. Ethan you are a genius
One of the funniest vids from you guys, strap yourself in for a sh#t 😂😂😂
Normally I'm quite the Ethan hater. He can be somewhat arrogant and clearly isn't much of a car guy which makes him kind of the odd one out. Especially since it doesn't seem he has been working on his craft much during the years. But this time hats off. I liked his project and what he has done with the focus. Very creative. Maybe start a DIY channel?
Time for the first ever pop-top focus?
i would sh*t behind a bush instead :D
This is it, chaps. We've reached peak Car Throttle.
Yaaaaas!
Finaly a real car on the channel, love the original 8 series
Does the Ecoflow suffer from the same Thermal Runaway that EV cars suffer with?   Could make a toasty nights sleep...
8 series 😍😍😍
Ethan, people may take the piss, but you’ve excelled yourself!
12:51 lmao who the fuck would want to sleep like that??? the size of that cupboard as well 😂 i love micro camping too and at 6'4'' even an old mercedes estate is a bit too micro... however i made it a priority to have a somewhat proper bed in there. my new foam matress (found it outside, clean af and just half a year old) is 5 inches thick and i've got plenty of space between my head and the roof. essential! did 28 days in scotland last year with that. also there's foldable toilets, i forget the name but i think the classic one is actually a british make if i'm not mistaken. when i was down in wales on my way back i took a shit among the sheep, 50 yards away from the road with no need to feel bad cause i shat in a foldable loo with a plastic bag inside and some powder to soak up the piss. happy days. p.s. as a german i consider the uk the no 1 place for all sorts of (weird) camping adventures, can't wait to return for the 5th time.
Thats a great video guys , loved it well done 😊
As much as I miss Alex. I love how you're all being extremely nice to each other rather than pulling each others legs constantly.
A bmw over heating? Never heard of it 🥲
Love these types of videos !!
A roof tent, an EcoFlow and Ethan's Focus, minus the bed ofc + A lovely campsite = perfection.
this was hilarious!
Great episode I could just imagine house racing been the next thing now.  With a banging camp at the end 😊
Great video, but that cut scene air tool sound is absolutely horrible...
Slap a roof tent on that Focus and you're golden babyyyy!!
Ethan's car was actually brilliant. Apart from the bed, he should have chucked the toilet because, let's face it, you can hardly sit on it, never mind wipe 👀😂 People have no idea how happy I would be to just drive into the middle of nowhere, sit down and play GTA Vice City all night. Amazing.
What's happened to Alex? How come he is not on "the show" anymore? 😔
I just want to take a moment to love and respect Edwins jacket
ayyy nice the mk1 is still going
What cost £10k?
What happened to the Saxo
My Dad had an 850CSI (V12) back in the day... was my favourite car he has ever owned, was gutted when he sold it.
As enjoyable to watch as this was, what the hell is happening with that Porsche 924?
I would join your new channel on a heart beat.
Just a question CT. HOW MUCH MONEY OF THIS CHANNEL GOES TO WANKER ALEX
Goal for next year is getting a latitude tent and do the nc500
Wicked video lads 😂😂💪🏼💪🏼👌🏼👏🏼
Well jealous of Edwin’s BMW
Tent on focus, boom 💥. Brilliant work on that focus, thought out brilliantly 😎
My friend got an ecoflow it caught fire
I have a few select videos from you guys, but I have to say that this one is right up there in the enterntainment factor....mostly cos of Ethan and his stupidly techy, yet stupidly stupid  HomeFocus (was that a magazine or programme once upon a time?!) ....that ecoflow thing though...what a piece of kit! I'm actually most impressed that it comes with that relatively giant solar panel! Great piece of kit for any camper-conversation I reckon. (oh and Jack....you are usually the funny one, but Boot Sandwiches?? c'mon mate! clearly the joke was Boot Butties)  Excellent stuff guys
This channel shits on auto Alex. Alex’s channel is so bloody samey with the exact same dialogue from that Taylor fella. Absolute borefest!!
You can definitely race a house, Top Gear did it already
The way Ethan kept saying "you'll see why the bed is high" made me think he was going to do some sort of grand reveal where the whole thing compacted, or the roof would lift up to give more space. But no, he really was just sleeping on half-an-inch of foam and pressed up against the ceiling!
Banging back a steak sandwich served from the back of a Focus is actually a preferable idea to some of the take away options in my area
I might be biased as an E46 owner but with this 8 series and the green M3 goddamn Edwin has some great taste in cars.
So much better without Alex!
You guys are just such a perfect team, so funny and maybe even the new top gear team! More please
marvelous timing lads, got snacks and all for a movie then i saw this pop up, great work
Ethan did crazy good with that Focus! I do think he should have sacrificed some of the storage for a better sleep though
The whole point of the Switch is that it is supposed to be portable as it has it's own screen. So Jack's BMW could easily have had it own Switch with minimal effort.
I have zero need for one of those battery packs and all I can think about is how much I want one
OMG HE KEPT IT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SAXO
Love the varied content coming from you guys. I find autoalex buying yet another BMW and messing around has already become so stale. Please keep up the good work, and random cars!
1:42 pretty sure thats beachy head road up from birling gap. excellent hooning road that one
There's nothing like wanting a micro camper on a budget to "put things in Focus."
This is the most enthusiastic Ethan has ever been about a car. Love ittttt!
oh fuck yes Mk1 Focus content 😍👌👍
I beg you carry this on, give the focus a V3
Tell corporate to let Edwin become the third presenter already
Ecoflow and Car throttle? Awesome the delta 2 pro is something I'm working on when the lights go out at my place. Good work y'all
honestly aside from the bed that Focus is legit perfect
i reckon the 850 could use a toilet
For once I watched the whole advert and am thinking of getting one too. Looks good but I just saw the price🫣 Just buy an inverter and a camp stove for a saving of around 98% Also, nice work Ethan!
Brilliant viewing boys 😎 had me laughing at your antics. The focus had all the mod cons 👌🏻 but the bmw stole the show. Well done on another great video
The focus is SICK now !! 😂
poor ethan
You should do a music festival shitbox challenge next summer. Ticket, camping gear, food, beer and vehicle all from a fixed budget.
Do you guys want to do a video on my shit box van conversion? Its covered in graffiti at the moment but I will start conversion from the weekend. Where can I send pics to see if you are interested
These three are absolutely fantastic. This is what car shows should be like - just a bunch of mates having a great time and making memories. Honestly finish every video wishing they were longer.
We need another episode with Adam
Why has the tag along look like he has no neck 😂😂
How do you get an m60b40 to overheat? 🤔
is car throttle running out of money without Alex? Don't get me wrong boys doing great job but with this sort of budget you can only go as far
Everybody gangsta until a roof tent on the 8 Series 🫡  Fair play though Ethan, Focus did good. We'll order the steak 🧑‍🍳
Great video lads...great consumer advice, Ethan's multi purpose focus is brilliant it does everything lol..but I'd still have the BM!
Got to love a Focus, the Mk1 having owned three of these, brilliant cars, super reliable and drives great. The Mk2 Focus is similar to it. Great to see the MK1 back on the channel, on the other hand, not quite liking seeing it in this condition as it’s a rare millennium edition as well.
No way guys im a big fan and you was in my town (eastbourne) i cant beleave i could have bumped into you guys dam it 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
BBC should have hired you three to host Top Gear instead of cancelling it!
Car Throttle > AutoAlex
Edwin’s collection of cars is just astoundingly good.
this is way too funny - when they woke up i literally had to pause the video to just collect myself
More of these challenges please
Bros are driving round where I live 😎
Don't you ever diss the E31 like this again.. OR ELSE!
Love video
fucking class video boys
SO couldnt ethan just fold the passanger seat forward to make more space for the bed?
Really enjoyed watching this; great chemistry from the lads, now I just wanna go camping xD
Problem with roof tents is you can easily go over the maximum designed weight for the roof.  Can’t think a car without b pillars will be that strong.
I'm so glad you sacked Autism Alex. ❤
Porsche 924...
steak out the back of a focus has to be better than out the back of an escort XD
The Focus with the roof tent would be the perfect combo
Ethan was on point for this video, except the sleeping arrangements. If i slept in there my morning wood would keep me wedged in for an hour. I would have to think of baseball just to get out.
I'm dying watching this episode in the middle of the night. Love this guys 😂
I'm from South Africa where we have constant load shedding due to government corruption and lack of infrastructure maintenance thanks to the corrupt ANC and sometimes days on end without electricity  due to stolen cables. Got my Ecoflow a couple of months back and cannot live without it! This was very entertaining, thanks guys!
Why blur the car when you have it in the thumbnail 😂😂😂
No shade on auto Alex loving his stuff with Taylor but this trio works better in my opinion.
I have got st170, just got it 2 days ago and it is lovely, i would like Ethans oppinion on it
Ethan, we salute you sir. Great job. That 850i is stunning. Especially with the roof tent.
Fantastic video lads. Would love to see a focus camper mk2. And what about Jack and Edwin doing converting their own budget cars. Make for a good challenge video
ethan any chance you might part with the rally light pods
Please do an update on the 924, you need to restore a car like that
Who hasn't wanted to recline when they're taking a shit?
That focus will never die
e31 camper goes hard
Ethan you're posture is horrible man, have a professional look at it PLEASE!
Ngl i new that the focus would be returning to the channel cuz I looked up the plate and it said it was back on the road wondering though if the golf and the saxo are still around
Didn’t you do this one already?
This is some OG TG tomfoolery and I love it 😍
i watched my uncle jump off beachey head that was a fun day i havent been there for 8 years and seeing it then nearly broke me
I have the delta max I love it it runs my Citroen berlingo I have turned into a micro camper loving the focus camping set up
Sell your sponsored shit somewhere else .......this is Just one long advert
When I finally sell my bimmer and get a 240 estate, i'm definitely putting one of those roof tents on it.
The curtains are also here. Lovely. Also respect for the Renault Jacket
Perfect timing, lads! Just sat down to chill at home after finishing work. Now I get to enjoy some quality Car Throttle content 👌👍
Loss of the rally lights has killed the car for me...😂
Wait a second , that place at the beginning of the video , was the place where the leaning citroen tower (from top gear) fall into the ocean while Clarkson was licking ice cream xD
Having a 1995 m8 as a daily is just a flex
Can't race a house... motorhome racing.
