SELF MADE CELEBRITY ❤❤ BY FAR ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Congrats Billie love ya 🎉❤❤
So deserving!  SUCH AN AMAZING SONG AND PERFORMANCE - perfectly nailed the emotion of this song and movie scene!!
Clickbait
Ok but Margot is absolutely gorgeous. Like i can’t stop admiring her beauty 🩷
What she wearing 😂 that big cloth
She got the wrong award. She should have gotten the most terrible  outfit at any award ceremony in history. Makes me question her intelligence.
Why is Ryan’s mouth always on workouts?
@MargotRobbie is simply the most beautiful, talented, intelligent woman to come along in a while. She is literally PERFECT.
Who is she?
This 1 song is moving the world. ❤❤❤ the impact she has on girls and women is just truly inspiring.
What on earth is she wearing??
In America or u don’t win any or one person win all ..
This is a movie about a literal toy....a toy that is it.
She could whisper gibberish into the mic and the academy would eat it up.
Brought back a lot of fond childhood memories u captured the essence of what Barbie actually meant to so many of us
I preferred I’m just Ken
Billie is getting light and light 😂 also she needs to fire her stylist asap she looked like a hobo who stole from the local op shop.
I'm still surprised that Barbie was a thing
❤❤❤
Absolute clown show !!!
The song was good. The movie was garbage, and I'm saying that a supporter of feminism, self-love or whatever it was they were trying to preach. I'm not exactly sure what the message or conflict of that movie was, to be honest. That's how convoluted and boring it was.
I really like her on Saturday Night Live, she’s a great actress and singer. But that outfit and hairstyle is just 😱 😱 Does she own a mirror?
She always has something goofy to say. Just take the award and go!
Billies favorite website? Tic Tok
If this ain’t the song we all related 🥹🥹
Love her style! She is so smart and beautiful
🌞AI voice oh well
Billie is this generations greatest artist
It says something when Barbie wins so many awards.. the world is shid..
She’s grown up so much with her brother.. that they started wearing eyeglasses 🙄 ridiculous people.. how is it possible that they are millionaires? Oh yeah.. they are part of a system and their parents have connections to push them into this position..
Did anyone see when the brother kissed the girl, billy looked away and almost left her hanging when she wanted a hug. She went to hug the girl beside the chick that her brother kissed. Am i crazy in the head?????
❤❤❤
This confused nutt case needs to be locked up in a mental health hospital. She looks and sounds ridiculous
Thej James bond Intro was plagiarized from Bad hop born this way made in 2019.
The Barbie speech was awkward. Amirite?
Billy your a little full of yourself!
This girl knows how to win Top of the top awards
So we'll deserved!! Best movie I've seen in years!❤
she deserved this sm i love her sm
I saw Barbie winning everything   wow I’m so surprised
She didn't seem emotional to me...
That song saved me a little bit too 😊 truly deserved award fr
Omg her talking voice is so soothing
I love Billie so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Billie totally deserves her award. What Was I Made For is simply a PHENOMENAL song. Thank you, Billie! 🤍
I’m so glad Billie won that award 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
❤
Ryan Gosling chewing a gum on the stage is just very disrespectful and arrogant to me
I lost my suit 2 months ago....haizzz
Absolutely beautiful so happy for them!
Very much 😅🎉❤
undeserved for sure, they be trying so hard to push her again to main stream
Dua, s song was way better
Absolutely deserved 👏 this song is incredible
Yay! This is the BEST Day ever! ❤️⭐️
Man oh man Margo is so fine
I would vote for Billie - she is still humble, can't say that about most
Billie has a tomato head🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's so humble and gracious. She says she's so afraid, and intimated by all the celebrities there, meanwhile she's as big of a celebrity as they come.❤
0:28 such a TALENTED DUO. Love them! Congratulations 🎊 ...Well deserved 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Good song, but it’s the worst of the Barbie songs nominated. I’m Just Ken is the actual best song of the movie. That song is a banger. I’m Just Ken should have won.
Why her
she deseves the bests❤
Great singer but yeah, that outfit is stupid
New artists deserve awards in every single way. Taylor has collected too many in her music career that its time to change that. We can agree this song most certainly deserved 👏
I wish E! News stops ruining videos like these by adding the most annoying female voice to narrate its videos.
How can I watch in England
Dance the night by Dua Lipa is the main theme for barbie why didn't she won...?
🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃
This is such a beautiful song  Congratulations Billie
Awarded for being a good little puppet
Love Light Peace 🌺🍃🌸🍃🌺🌱🌹✨✨✨✨✨✨💫
Music is literally gone to the dogs! What bloody joke our society is fast approaching
It’s about materialism and narcissism  👎
Well deserved
Why was I tearing up during this speech? 🥺🥹
Horribel Eilish so worst Songs
MAans she has the oworst style ever. ITS not edgy it just looks bad in everyway. And it bugs me becaus she is so gorgeous and jsut holding herself down
everyone should be free to dress like they want but it was so hard to put on a dress like every women ?
Dua Lipa is the one who deserves it
Bravo Billie and Go Vegan!!!!!!!!!!
That girl? Looks really stupid
💝
I swear I knew it ,I knew it .
I love her honest comments about her life. It takes a lot of guts to admit we're weak, especially in a room full of amazing actors.  It's amazing how words can change a mind, heart and life. Awesome !
congratulations,  blilie elilish, ❤músicas ❤awrd ❤10000 ❤
Greta Gerwig & Margot Robbie: What a adorable Womens!
She always deserves to won the Awardsd! Another great song by Billie Eilish !
The feeling when they call out Finneas' name too is just so wholesome✨
ICONIC
Congratulations Bellie ..You made a legendary Spirit for "Barbie " and "Barbie girls "🥺💗💗💗💗💖💖..
Such a great song!!!
Oh my Gosh, no, I don’t believe it😢😢😢😢winer is Dua Lipa❤❤❤❤
DANCE THE NIGHT should have won best song. But I guess Dua Lipa is not part of the elite club.
She looks so adorable. I am so proud of her.❤
Well deserved
شكلها يفشل
You pair together 2 of the least likely things in the world to have in common - Billie and Barbie.  And what u get is the most profound solemn self-doubting emotive question humans have asked themselves from the beginning.  Amazing and thnx to Finneas as well.
Merece muitoooooo❤🎉😊
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
It's a man. Man.
Who cares.....Barbie.....Eilish= Lame.If you watched the movie or listen to her go have both an eye and hearing exam. Just saying. Have a nice day.
La canción no solo te toca te marca ahí en el alma... Y que mejor con la voz de Billie ... Y la producción de Finneas
The fact that Billie is getting these awards so early in her career is a big feat
I personally dont feel this song is good. Very simple lyrically and musically. Her voice is beautiful. Also, it's a feeling sorry for myself song. Not healthy mentally I believe. Peace.
i Love Billie
For me best song : Dance The Night, Dua Lipa.
billie deserves everything...im so proud of her
Golden globe goes to used tampon scalp
Who dresses her?
❤❤❤❤
I’m so happy Barbie won 🥇
Billie we all know mental illness coming when we see it. Get some help dude.
I really wanted Taylor to win, but I’m really happy for margot and everyone who was/worked on Barbie! They deserved it❤
😭😭😭
At this rate Billie will prob get an EGOT one day she’s snagging all these big awards
Why doesn’t she let her bro speak he helped write it
Best thing about this is Taylor Swift had to just sit there knowing that Billie is going to go on and win her second Oscar when Taylor doesn't have 1
Whose this Billy eyelash dude 🤷🏻‍♂️
There has to be a sequel to Barbie! And you know what? As far as how successful the songs were, especially Ryan Gosling’s I’m Just Ken, and of course, Margot Robbie and the other actors, we should have Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson, and Carly Rae Jepsen join the cast with acting roles and songs!
Why do Billie and her brother give me Flowers in the Attic feelings
Liberal cult for Pedaphiles
Boooo! Dua Lipa got robbed 😡💔 🇦🇱
How did I'm Just Ken not win WHAT ?.?.?
YES!!!! ALL WOMEN NO MALE PRODUCER! LOVE IT!!!!!!
It’s Joker and Harley Quinn hugging
It's amazing to see how her artistry in 'What Was I Made For' not only contributed to the success of Barbie but also helped her personally. Her genuine appreciation for her brother, Phineas, and the entire team behind the film was so endearing.
.....Billie, you are an incredible songwriter......always remember that ....strive to be happy...
Barbie should have won best movie!
That's one ugly outfit if I've ever seen one
Billie Eilish is such a pretty girl but does everything she can to hide it. Congratulations to her on this award.
Yes
Margot is adorable. I remember her teen years on an Australian tv show called neighbours and I gotta say she hasn’t changed one bit ❤
Yep, that Billie Eilish and Finneas's song made a notch better movie and at that memorable one.
I love Billie,but I had to finally change the channel. This program was so boring
This should win Best Original Song in a Motion Picture and Best Original Score for the Academy Awards!
Margot Robbie is soooo gracious, lovely and beautiful. The dress on her... Just stunning. I don't like the movie but she's an amazing woman and actress💕
💓💓. Masterpiece song.
Who dressed her... My God.
On the other hand, the Malicious Tulpa was never anybody's friend. Did he ever tell you about our pre-Spygate past?
James Skip Brandt Phillips, the hospital stooge/briber, isn't my friend? We were friendly enough.
love Billie and Finneas so much! loved the barbie movie sm and the whole cast too! all incredibly talented people who deserve all the love <33
Dance the night deserved it!
THESE TWO ARE LEGENDARY! What was I made for is such a beautifully written song. That song has gotten me through A LOT. the portrayal she enlisted in that song is so real and empowering. The juxtaposition of floating and then falling down, and the mental health of not knowing how to feel & sadness is so human of her. I feel it’s the best song written of her discography. This is a well deserved win. Congratulations You Two🏆🎊❤️
It brought her out of her funk. Now we want to hear some funk or somethin' Billy.😂🎉 keep on rocking or understating. There are so many covers you could do too.
I knew she would win for this tune. She and bro are  multifaceted 😅
Gross. The wrong winner
