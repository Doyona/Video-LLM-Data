watching this a year later cause this was the episode i watched a different pov instead of grian
i love that you were suposed to be a helping angel, making grian do what you say..  but instead you made grian make other people do what you say xD
I've seen over half the servers pov of secret life and I didn't realize anything was off with grian lol
Grian is so weird that when he is forced to act weird, everyone thinks its normal.
You know all those memes about people understanding the assignment? Jimmy doesn't. Grian was far too patient with him, I would have re-rolled tasks after the first warning.
Honestly all of this was just normal Hermit behaviour
Awh I wanted to see your pov of you revealing yourself 🥲
I watched Grian’s perspective first so seeing Jimmy’s is interesting.
I completely forgot about this but suddenly decided to come back and watch Jimmy’s perspective. Just brilliant. I’d love to see this as part of a gimmick for a future season. Actually, at the time of commenting, no one has gotten out yet in Past Life. Just saying.
who's here in 2025 🔥
Is it just me or does anyone else just thinks jimmy’s mad whenever he shouts without his facecam like on someone elses pov🤔(no hate)
See the problem is this is just Grian behaviour.
Watching this as a person with social anxiety, I can’t decide if I should laugh or cry 😭🙏
20:23 etho really knows I swear.
18:56 20:42
This pov is way different than Grian’s
I love how offended timopher sounds when etho says he missed Mumbo and Lizzie before him
After watching Joel's pov how did jimmy not see him at all theres tnt right there 9:50
man the wild like zombies are like the complete reverse of this task lawl
LET'S GO!! 🐶🐶🐶🐶 LMAODSFBHDSBH
Why am I not watching this until now😂This is hilarious😂
rewatching this and i love how apprehensive grian sounds to say gem's sorry is weird LMAO 3:09
"you're supposed to be an angel" yes and lucifer was an angel too, but look how he fell
Crazy how this was nearly a year ago
I live this video Best video ever! I can't believe I never watched your pod or grains this was amazing
This having more views than all his other secret life episodes is amazing
e
16:31 saved it
11:20 jimmy kinda worried about grian :)
I just happened to click on this off the last wild life episode but this genuinely got me hurting, it’s just so funny
9:03 LOL
JoJo fans who have seen part 7!    Grian essentially just got Hey Ya!
it wouldve been so funny if someone had a task like, "someone is being haunted by a ghost, find out who it is and exorcise them!"
I just love to come and rewatch these
does he not know who he's trying to make sound weird gives you gotta you gotta really do something to me personally, I probablytell him to call them war
FOR THE BAD BOYS
Whenever Grian says something strange they just leave like “idk how to respond to that”
On tonight's episode of impractical jokers
Grian is normally so cheery but this time he just sounded incredibly miserable
Grian's entire episode could've been captioned with "🙄"
I love the few moments where Jim actually warning Grian about danger, it's so cool to hear you get serious lol
JIM UR SUPPOSED TO KEEP HIM SAFE AND SOUND
yes it's me Jim i'm dead🤣🤣🤣
17:56 oohhhh, Jimmy pointed him out! I was curious about how Grian knew Martyn was there
MAKE. ANOTHER
Jimmy really decided that he would make it to session 8
11:57 "The S in your name stands for STEW-PID."-Grian
8:59
13:36 etho's deep voice mixed with the bark 🫶
Jimmy could had been helpful that time, but he decided to not be
The fact that Cleo and Etho barely hesitates to do stuff with Grian shows how much they trust each other.
Watching Grian's POV first then seeing this is hilarious. I have to watch other POV's now
I just realized this: in secret life Jim was the second yellow, the second red, and the second dead
To be fair, Grian does a lot of weird random stuff anyway. It seems like he always has some sort of little troublemaking angel on his shoulder 90% of the time
them leaves do indeed point up
Love how Jimmy’s thumbnail is an angel following grian , whilst grians’s thumbnail is just him getting haunted by a ghost
That was funny, impressive and wholesome 😊
Grian swore and it wasn’t bleeped 😂
The way Jimmy was not only controlling Grian, but also getting others to do things throughout is hilarious.
15:12 “When is that ender pearl gonna-“ 😂 cut perfectly
5:43 This series has just desensitized everyone to all the weirdness going on 😂
ahhhhhhhhhhhh doctor who reference love that ,when I think jimmy cant get any better
Clever Jimmy being selectively Angelic...Grian's awkwardness was palpable.
In the next season of this series you should call it Guardian Life or something and make it so everyone is pared with someone ( like double life ) but it’s activated when there partner dies, so when the partner dies they’re like a guardian angel. It’ll make it so the dead can have fun in the smp still and for some cool story’s 😁
Grian with Solidarity in his brain is surprisingly Etho-ish
Jimmy got to mess with Grian but missed the BEST callback to Grian messing with him: Arriving late and saying he was doing things.
If i had a nickel for every time someone used ghost jimmy in a life series in episode 8 i would have 2-no wait THREE NICKELS
Ender crystal scene - it was the best POV, IMHO!
props to Grian for being able to hold it together so well this whole session, i know i wouldn't have been able to.
18:00: Guardian Angel 4tw!!!
I just don't know what it means that you had Grian doing SO much weirdness yet everyone just took it in stride!!! 🤣🤪🤯🤪🤣
Aw man you should have kept in the reveal at the end! I would have loved your pov of that!
Next season you should have people who die become guardian angels and if the person assigned to the angel dies, they switch places immediately. Like taking turns at life. If both of the pair die within 15 seconds of each other they are both out. Could be called "Co-life".
HEY JIMMY! I know you probably won’t read this, but i’d love to see you and Katherine play ‘🔓Escape Room’ on roblox.  PS: I’m a massive fan and keep up the great work
Everyone is just so used to Grian's random weirdness 🤣
this was so funny 😭
This was the best pairing for this task, I loved every second of this video ❤❤❤❤❤
THE WAY HE LOOKED AT THE CHAT TO SEE JOELS “FOR THE BAD BOYS”😭😭💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💞💞💞💕💕💕
Grians POV would of been hilarious if he didn't show the book and none of this audio was on his video. He would of looked insane until the end.
Great ep. Just thought it was funny Tim was pumping himself up for being a great angel… while Grian got deaded almost twice.
Yeah... is Grian familiar with the work of angels in the myths and legends they come from? They aren't necessarily "good."
May I ask, what happened to New life? 😢
this episode was just ADHD in a nutshell, well, sometimes
Just like how Jimmy and Grian were baffled by how normal everyone took that epeiaode. Fun watching all the perspectives XD
"Nothing wrong with neck-kissing your homies."- SmallishBeans, 2023
i so want a grian cam😭😭
2:54 Oh my gosh I watched gems video first and I was SO CONFUSED why grian said that and now I know why 😂
I did think Grian was a little silly but I just assumed he was tired or sick or something. It all makes sense now dkshg
I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard at anything. Phenomenal chemistry, phenomenal improv skills, just absolute comedy gold start to finish. Top shelf stuff, lads.
this was so funny i acc had to pause sm to laugh 😭😭😭
I don’t think I stopped smiling from start to end of this video 😂
honestly half of me hopes if they ever do more smps in the future they'll find a way to include dead players [that's fair and balanced of course] because this was so fun to watch, by far my fav episode of the whole season. i just get bummed out losing someone i like watching early and then never getting to see their involvement again as yknow they're dead. it'd be cool if ghosts were given something to do
8:25 you can see the trap being setup
Ayyy they did what i mentioned. When mumbo and you died i said they should bring yall back as ghosts and its awesome to see they did.
+bonus pov watched ✅️
Love how you can see Joel in the background while Etho and Grian were talking about Yoshi
I hate to be a hall monitor, but you absolutely, 100% failed your task. Not even close. You were never an angel nor fulfilled your duties as such. 100% no question fail
WAIT. WHEN JIM TOLD GRIAN TO SING LOUDER - as I watched grian first, I never realized he did a double take at Jimmy- ~3:56
11:55 does"does the s in your name stand for stupid?" And then he goes and says there are two s's in his name
18:07 HELP IM DYING THAT WAS SO FUNNY HIME JUST DOING THE KISS AGH
I  LOVE THIS!! IT'S SO FUNNY LMAOO. POOR GRIAN
“Say something wacky.” Grian: *the leaves are all pointing upwards* 2:39
My main takeaway from this experience is that Etho is such a good sport
Bad boys need to get back together in next series :)
i didn’t like my one comment
Btw Grian improved so much playing Survival Minecraft. I remember when he joined HC and at first he didn’t know how to play basicly. Now he’s quite skilled in every aspect.
Man we really should have the ghosts pov after they die, until the series end, it would be sooooo much fun to have the ghosts togeder comenting about the rest of the game
I love how when Grain gets circleds his face just goes very serious and starts focusing watching his back!
This might be my favorite video of all time
You were the perfect Guardian angel,  chaotic and also guarding
Can we appreciate the doctor who reference? Love you, Jimmy!
No one noticed because Grian is so weird all the time.  Haha.
I hope there will be more of these >Shoulder Demon< tasks with dead people. It's hilarious. xD
Omg that “you say sorry weird.” Cracked me up
This was a fab episode!  The chemistry between you two is so natural and made for some hilarious moments. - Saw Grians POV first, had to come and see it from your angle.
I am sorry for this random comment but, the face you made at 19:45 when saying "that was wholesome" reminded me of Freddie Prinze Jr. when he was younger (Freddie from the Scooby Doo live action movies).
Saw Grians first.
they are reusing the last life script so hard cleo wants to kill bigb again the mumbo jim death thing happened guys we know your secrets lol
Okay Ken
Task Suggestion: Two dead members are to be constantly talking to you. One is a devil and one is an angel. You must listen to both as best you can.
Ah yes the lovely weeping angel Jimmy who died so early.
It doesn't feel right, Jimmy has too much power
Seeing this makes me wonder how cool Etho and Jimmy will be teaming up together
8:57 this bit is so funny 😂
Did grian say "let's workout together" to cleo? Didnt hear if he did or not
This should be a new series!!! Imagine that you had half the server alive and half the server is assigned a player that controls them and has to listen to them! Basically like a shoulder devil/angel scenario! That would be soooo cool!
You should have had grian admit to destroying the bookshelves
The grian enunciated the s in stupid(SStupid)
From Grians POV Jim sounded like a psychopath
This was very funny =P
That's an inventive task! A lot of potential for humor! The only problem is that people take all the weirdness in stride.
This was a great vid but also, you should play lethal company with the gang!
I think this would have been funnier if Mumbo and Lizzie got to do it it. can you Imagine Lizzie telling Joel to avenge her cuz she was still mad about her slumber party?
8:26 the fact jimmy saw Joel setting that trap and said absolutely nothing is sending me
this is the karma for him always teasing you and being late to your streams
This was unbelievably funny
This episode just made me love etho even more bc of how wholesome he is fr
Jimmy making Grian do stupid and crazy things is good for a laugh but I can't help but feel this was under utilised. Grian could have used him for spying and other crazy OP abilities but instead this power just turned Grian onto a puppet. An amazingly funny video either way, but if I were Grian I would have done things differently...
I love how etho is so calm
This is literally now my favourite video on YouTube.
Wow!🤩
I would LOVE to see more videos from ghost povs, i have always wanted to know how those who are out early react to things
Best Secret Life episode!
It’s funny how everyone is out for scars blood-
Grains little devil more like
i love etho so much he just goes along with all the weird stuff xD
Finally we get to see more ghost POV
You could have used Spectator mode to easily find diamonds, guided Grian to them in some convoluted way, and then as soon as he sees them said "don't mine them." :D  It would be technically angelic because he could still have allies mine them or come back for them next episode, and yet still so, so evil.
Cleos pov makes a lot more sense
The sheer fiendish glee on Solidarity's face the first few times Grian instantly obeys his commands....I hope Grian watches this episode and at least sees how much joy he brought Jimmy here.
Joel saying “For The Badboys” right at the session where Jimmy came back is such a coincidence
damn what an angel, cannot belive he missed joel laying the trap at 8:27 lmaoo
This just shows you 2 have the same brain because I didn't know Grian had to do this watching from other perspectives!
Honed.Ty, can’t wait when in two years I Time, “The Leaves are Pointing Upwards” is in the chorus of evil anvils sl song
That Was awesome
You can see Martin at 8:26 making a trap lol
I loved this!
it’s so funny watching joel’s perspective first and then seeing his hole in the ground the entire time jim is watching grian underground
I absolutely love how we can see Joel making his trap in the background on more then one occasion.
WHEN I SAW THIS UPLOAD MY BRAIN DIDNT REALIZE YOU WERE OUT- I ONLY REALIZED NOW
Lol. I mean, demons are just fallen angels, so you telling him to do bad things still fits, right!? 😅😅😅
I really liked the secret life series. But I think it would have been interesting if there was the devil/angel like Cleo had last episode, but like this.
Jimmy is like Grian’s Jiminy Cricket (his conscience). But he’s going to mess with Grian more then helping him 😆
i love this idea, keeps the fallen in the series and adds laughs for us.
Shoulder Angel-ception.  Jimmy orders Grian to order two other people to jump in pits, fix bookshelves, dance like zombies and spin around.  And they do it.
I've missed you glad you are back at least for a episode.
i loved the jimmys pov of grian and etho having conversations underground with jimmy looking at the whole situation from the outside.
Etho sounded soooo disappointed when he heard about the bookshelves lol
I think it would be really funny for three players to have this task at once, for each ghost. And the ghosts wouldn't know that each other were part of the tasks either... this would definitely lead to shenanigans.
You sir need to stop teasing us with secret life episodes
This is probably one of my most favorite episodes to come from the entire Life series lmao
ngl, desperately wish I knew where I could get a sweater like that, it's so fheckin cute
The thing with angels is BE NOT AFRAID
PFFFFTHBT I JUST NOTICED TIM’S PROFILE PICTURE I LOVE IT HAHAHAHA
Broke: watching Grian's POV Woke: watching Jimmy's POV
I love that this series has been so chaotic that no one is batting an eye at anything at this point
Love how Grian is all like I survived the zombie apocalypse and all I got was a Solidarity angel. Oh Timmy! this should be fun
wow this episode of crazy christmas village had a LOT of guests i'm impressed! (though not a lot of christmas...)
I've just gotta say, you were perfect for this task! You have so many funny ideas and are so chaotic hahaha.
This has been my favorite task yet, and that is saying something with all the fantastic tasks people have gotten this series. Whoever came up with this is brilliant.
How did they do this when he wasn’t appearing on the server member list?
Sims 4 be like
I'm so glad you got to do an extra episode!
I love how all of this just went fully unquestioned because everyone's had seven weeks to get used to the oddest little things :D
24:03 lol
Can you do more secret gost life please good work keep up
I think it's a bit cheesy that Jimmy was brought back and I don't believe it was random pairing up with Grian; however, it has been quite funny.   So funny when Jimmy wanted to know who he missed the most he went Mumbo right off the bat, then added Lizzie.  Out of the three eliminated people, Jimmy wasn't on the list.  🤣 But then Etho being wholesome and polite didn't want to rank the missing people. ✝
Very interesting!
HA HA the way they say Mario!
I think I've found my favorite task of the season
What a great task to be part of :-D
1:15 tim you have NO idea how insane tumblr went over that line
This is by far THE BEST Minecraft video we’ve ever seen. Bravo to you and props to Grian for playing along
I'm willing to bet that Jimmy is abusing his spiritual powers on purpose just to get back at those who bumped him off.
I love the transition from control to recon, very funny sitch
This would be the first time maybe TIM got to be part of ending episodes
this episode Etho and Cleo were the parents of a 5 yo that wants to make them do silly stuff and Grian was the 5 yo kid and u cant convince me otherwise
A bonus Secret Life Episode from Jimmy. A Suprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Honestly, I wish Lizzie and Mumbo could have been assigned to yellows, too.
This was the funniest task Gria n could have possibly gotten You will cause a "Grian out of contexg" video sometime þə
Who else wanted tim to be wearing the saint jean jim skin? 😅
EPIC Task Idea for the Finale: Everyone gets a secret to start the last episode. Each of their secrets is to kill someone. For instance, BDubs's task is to "kill Grian," Grian's task is to "kill Etho," Ethos' task is to "kill Impulse" and so on until you loop back to BDubs. You cannot harm anyone else unless they attack you first. If you kill your target, then you have to kill your target's person. For instance, if BDubs kills Grian, now he has to kill Etho. It's like everyone is the boogie, but for only one specific person. The last person standing wins!
Wait now I’m curious, are mumbo and Lizzie also watching for funsies 😮
An ally with spectator mode would be such a usefull spy... but nah, he's an imp in Grain's ear
14:57 where was the guardian angel just then?
This is probably My favorite Episode of the series😭
etho's reactions to all the stuff jimmy made grian do are golden, he really did not question it at all kkkkkk so wholesome
I wonder how Scott would have reacted if Jimmy had told Grian to give Scott a flower
Did you just rub your canary curse off on grian? 😂
Absolutely nothing is too weird this season.
*points Grian in the complete opposite direction*  "thAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT GUYS"
Such a fun twist to see you back!! :D
Awe. We didn't get to see the reunion at the end of the session. Those end of session reveals and wrapups were my favorite parts, but everyone keeps cutting them out of their videos.
This is the best OVA in all of anime.
🌟 ABSOLUTE GENIUS!! 🌟  Whoever came up with that Ghostly Task - FaNtAsTiC idea... and for it to be you with Grian!  Sweeeeet Perfection.  I had SOOO Many laughs watching his vid, & Even More watching it all from your POV!  Thought you did Great, a Mischievous Spirit but a Very Helpful Guardian Angel as well. ❤ It was GREAT seeing you back, VERY BUMMED when you went out,.. and so HAPPY FOR YOU that your Curse is Gone.  😊
I love how jimmy told Grian to go to Martyn
I like how this was kind of a way to bring a dead player back into the series. I think there should be a mechanic in future seasons where ghosts can participate somehow
8:12 This looks so much like some Minecraft clickbait thumbnail
It's useless. It's not any different from normal Grian.
Woah is that a new adaptation of A Christmass Carol
What an ‘angel’
You have to guide the SUN‽
You can see Joel there 8:27
I love how Etho and Cleo are just partaking in everything 😂😂😂
Honestly this was the most fun task yet. Just a laugh from start to end!
" the ghosts all stay above the clouds and watch " no, don't let Jimmy stay there, he's gonna fall off again
This shows how, Jimmy doesn’t need to be alive in the life series to still have a fun impact on the experience 👍
“When is that ender pearl gonna…”!?!??! Lol
This is so fun 😃
OH YEAH!! I love(d) this!!
Not really an angel there, Jim. Rather a fallen one
I don’t know what’s more impressive. The fact that the canary curse didn’t get to Grian or the fact that nobody questioned Grian talking to Jimmy and getting instructions from him
This was so fun!
This is such a fun task! Secret Life tasks can be a bit hit or miss imo, but this one really highlights how good they can be!  Etho just roasting you without even realizing 😂
You can hear Martyn getting excited to get a woof woof from Grain lol
Secret idea  Convince at least 3 players to join this in stocking one player you must make sure they know you are stalking them but they shouldn’t notice you very often
AAAAAAAAA Jimmy!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Literally the moment i pressed this video my neighbor started drilling and now i cant watch the video 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The amount of cringe, laughter, and confusion was crazy
That cheeky grin while saying "Fantastic" is really the only correct response to Grian confirming he has to do everything he's told to do.
Oh I loved this .😂
The leaves are pointing upwards
thismustbealittlebitofasuprise t o y o u
10:32 EYYYY
Jimmy is so desperate for life series content that they did this😂😂 Awww poor Jimmy(😂lol)
Despite Timmy being in complete control, somehow Grian still wins.
16:14 "For the bad boys" 😭😭😭 sobbing rn
omegalul
The sun always rejects The ones he couldn’t protect He now talks to the skies His mind trapped in lies His brother is long dead Canary’s song rings in his head
does this mean that Timmy is a watcher?
ok
Thanks for the laughs, what a fun way to bring you back.
lmao
JOEL SNEAKILY DIGGING TO MAKE A TRAP THING AND JIMMY DIDN'T SEE 💀
THE LEAVES ARE ALL POINTING UPWARD IS ONE OF THE WEIRDEST THINGS EVER AND I’M SURPRISED NO ONE QUESTIONED IT
I feel so bad for grian ❤😂
The leaves are all pointing upwards😂😂😂😂
I watched grian first and I just want to say........ I'm really disappointed that you didn't connect to reveal yourself then say "don't do anything til I get back, I just need to fold my socks" and then straight up leave for 5 minutes
This needs to be a season. People dont that dont wanna physically play can be angels 😂 with rules ANGEL SMP
Jimmy is finally getting to see what a Life series finale looks like 😂
Whats funny is that this could have been an oppurtinity for grian and his teammates to get intel from the other members but jimmy just spent the whole time messing with grian 😂😂😂
this was great, i need Jimmy, Grian, and Etho on a team becasue it would be hilarious
8:27 Tim was so busy laughing that he hasn't noticed the trap.
Amazing video, hilarious, I enjoyed this so much!
the ghost jimmy possessing grian x joel interaction, i cackled
Now I just want to see Lizzie be a guardian angel for Joel
If there's one thing I've learned it's that Jimmy and Etho would probably have a good time hanging out together.
Jimmy was having way too much fun with this.
Observation. Jimmy spent most of the time just kinda playing around with Grian. but the instant genuine danger gets presented to him, he drops the light tone and warns him The canary stopped singing to warn him
The fact that I watched grians video and I wished more than anything for Timmy’s pov
Halfway through jimmy actually being helpful was oddly sweet. And then it was ruined by pettiness.
nice little special episode!
Jimmy being Grian's guardian angel is going to be very chaotic lmao 😂 And Jimmy being able to stir up some chaos without being physically there is absolutely amazing and hilarious 😂
your a mvp this episode give or take grian dieing  JIMMY HAS ACHIEVED GOD MODE
This is a banger way of getting further then seven episodes, good job LDJimboLady.
Amazing episode wonderful made me stim so hard i dislocated my wrist 10/10
When etho is just as weird that it seems normal
He's in a session 8!
Jimmy is like william afton he always comes back
This is a very welcome surprise!!!  Etho needs to watch this 😂😂😂😂
im so glad dead players can do something now
I like how Grian basically ran into that arrow. Or Pearl is just good at predicting movements.
Good choices don't always lead toi good outcomes so in reality those bad choices Tim made Grian do could have led to another outcome and maybe this was the better one. Butterfly effect 101
This had to be Grian's easiest task cause he basically got to just act normal
Jimmy: Be on time to my streams Grian: *instantly rerolls to hard*
I had this task idea for lizzie when she died. So her husband would do her bidding.
Pretty sure you can teleport to grian in spectator mode using hotbar keys. This video looked so fun on both sides, though!
Lol its like you're playing the sims XD Was half expecting you to drown Grian in a pool halfway through...
this is like impractical jokers
Jimmy playing with Minecraft YouTubers like they're dolls
Grian and Jimmy are the best combo, especially for secret life😂😂
Grian looks so insane Jimmy, well done 😂😂
How did my AU from last week partly become true
This is so unhinged. I love it.
Kinda cute that Jimmy used Grian to woof at Martyn from beyond the grave
FOR THE BAD BOYS!!!!
Cool
i knew this was gonna be a task!! i wish it was mumbo though
This was so funny to see your payback towards grian
I watched this episode from Cleo's perspective first, so I just thought Grian's task was; "convince Etho to do the weirdest things."
This is so funny
So happy to see that you got to play a part in another episode, Jimmy. The series isn't the same when you're not in it.
Jimmy was not holding back on his intrusive thoughts
grian literally acts just as bonkers all the time naturally 😂😂😂
Is it me, or is Etho just freakishly good at making guttural utterances (gutterances)
I just watched Grian's ep. Tim literally got him to do the weirdest things 😂
I love that Jimmy brought up doctor who weeping angels. Jimmy, what’s your favourite dr.who character or episode?
Well. Now we know why the watchers made sure to take Jim out first every time. As soon as he isn't first out, he becomes more powerful than we could possibly imagine. #ForceGhostJimmy2023  Seriously, what an awesome surprise. I legit had the weirdest feeling we had not seen the last of you, but I didn't expect you to actually return. :)
Etho and Grian are my new favorite duo after this season 🤣
TIM is back like never before!
this was so hilarious haha, etho's a tough crowd tho lol
Etho is the most unruffable person on the server. Nothing phases him
I just watched Grians episode and I was hoping jimmy would make a episode of his pov and I’m so glad he did
23:51
I love this series so much. Can't wait for you to be resurrected again for the next Life series.
More. Ghosts. In. Life. SMP.  This was great. Thanks Jimmy! ❤
I really wished you ghosted Scott. Just imagine how out of character it would've been for him 😂
jims reward for dying second ! yippee !!!
etho canda man canda ppl are so nice
These two POVs made me laugh so much
This was excellent and it seemed like it was so much fun for you both lol
I definitely miss Mumbo the most! He is the best!!
Congrats Jimmy! You’ve made episode 8!
Hiiiiiiiiiii
That was totally unexpected but fun. gg
The only way Jimmy could make it to session 8
This is so funny and cute I hope the other dead ppl get to participate
This is honestly adorable that you participated in Grian's task, and I love that you were a pretty good guardian angel by the end there.
When Grian said “the leaves are all pointed upwards” I died of laughter 😂😂
I like to imagine that Jimmy went to third person mode in the beginning but forgot we can't see him 😂
Oh my gosh you were working your way into being my new favorite. I was sad you died, but this was a perfect episode!
He underestimated teammates ability to be like “yeah that’s probably for a task so i don’t care”
BEST. EPISODE. EVER 🤣
Jimmy over here Creating fan fiction moments
This was by far, my favorite episode of yours! You are were too funny!
Grian was perfect for this he’s already so unnormal that no one questioned anything
OH MY GOD. WHAT??
THIS IS WHAT YOU RUSHED OFF AT THE END OF YOUR LIVESTREAM TO DO?????????
My favorite episode so far this season, everyone needs a Jimmy-Angel on their shoulder. LOL
Limited Life animatics were like... dramatic team love and self-sacrifice... Secret Life animatics are gonna be like... Etho & Cleo dancing and twirling around...  Can't wait.
7:35 Ladders cameo
Tango gets two imaginary friend tasks. Grian gets an actual imaginary friend task.
I can instantly tell that this is payback to what @grian has done to you in your previous videos and streams, and you’ve been sipping on a cup of tea, that a sound of hydration from your mouth, then you say “Revenge tastes sweet, especially on Grian.”
low key i would LOVE a spectator POV for the final session
I love this so much thank you for doing this and recording it <3
This might be my favourite episode this season
Nice job, Guardian AnJim!
Jimmy the thing is, nothing you told grian to do was weird....for grian. So you cant expect everyone to be weirded out by grian...if grian is not doing anything weird.😅❤😂
I'm confused, is his real name Jimmy or Timmy? he legitimately looks more like a Tim than a Jim, but everyone calls him Jim here.
jimmy not noticing in time the rigged bed, or the end crystal trap, is surprisingly fitting for someone that dies first _almost_ every season!
I love that Jim got to participate one last time!
Jimmy you are like a worm, YOU COME WEASEL YOURSELF BACK IN THE SERIES- 😭 ( + G should be glad you were his ghost and not the others cause no one suspected even anything... + You know things he does too much and it makes it normal for some reason)
The fact that he went out and sneaked back in to this season is crazy looks like we get a ep of a player from the land of the dead is insane Jimmy got to 7 session s
8:25 I love how Joel creating a trap and sneaking near Etho and Grian XDD
this was so fun to watch, i couldn’t stop smiling
The sheer joy on Jimmy’s face when he found out it was Grian is so funny
JIMOTHY RETURNS
It would be so amazing if joel got that task and he got lizzie. 😭
This is the only time Grian has ever listened to Jimmy willingly..
I wish it was jimmy and martyn but i love grian and jimmy too :DD
This is my favourite episode, anyone else? The chaos is beautiful
controlling Grian for a session must've been so fun lmao, it was fun to watch
This is literally an episode of impractical jokers and I love it
I just watched grians pov I didn’t expect u to post a video as well!!! This makes me so happy :)
There should be a revival thing
I was kinda missing your voice in martyn's episodes tbh, glad to hear ya again
People who were watching Jimmy stream and he said "right now the secret life server is recording" I am the only one that heard him say this in his stream?
okay okay okay this is being added to the head cannon book. its there its in now. bam. head cannon. jimmy follows people around and haunts them when he dies.
Does this mean he technically outlasted Mumbo?
was not expecting there to ever be another secret life video on a channel that already got out
Jimothy: always getting the mick Also Jimothy: TEHEHEHEHEHE
Ohh no I just realized that grain never said it’s a me a grian to everyone noooooooooooooooo
this is too funny
This episode is a dream come true
As much as I loved this I would’ve loved to see Timmy as Martyn’s guardian Angel to protect him as a big dog one last time- especially since he uh- *cough cough* attempted to kill his own teammate- *cough cough*
Lol! Lizzy tried so hard to get Cleo and Etho to notice her being weird, too!
I’m sorry but I just can’t stop imagining if this was animated just a canary flying around grian whispering stuff in his ear😂
So basically Jimmy is backseating grian
You did an amazing job🎉
Wow, Jimmy has got further in this series than he has in any other one!
OwO?
This was absolutely epic!!! Love how hard you were working! You were both helpful (saved him several times) and you were trying to mess him up a bit 😂
Jimmy, Grians entire episode is gonna be in a out of context video now isn't it? 🤣🤣🤣
When I tell you my jaw DROPPED, when i saw secret life, like i litterally gasped.
I was not expecting jimmy to upload. I watched Cleo’s first and I was really… well unsuspecting
Oh I’m so happy he made a video on it!! Nicee I was hoping he would cause I really wanted to see his pov lol
Man Etho is such a trooper, just goes with things with no question
"Timmy is back, somehow."
Love this <3
this is a nice surprise! XD Is it bad if I want more. Can we all of the dead to become their angels again.
This was one of the best tasks BY FAR, and it was only made better because of you!!
24:15 joel is back at it with the neck kissing 🫡
I just watched your "which Hermit are your" vid the other day and I think the fact that no one (including myself) thought Grain was acting weird really proves the result of that vid.
You are supposed to be “An ANGEL” Jimmy,  not a weirdo!
Grian's lucky he wasnt told to day he hates Kakashi, i think that def mightve gotten a reaction out of Etho lol
This is great! The fact that they’re barely noticing it 😂
Most unique task so far
Bro i found this in my notifications i clicked on it and guess what is in my fyp GRIANS PERSPECTIVE 😅😅😂😂😮😢❤❤
Yooo, its Jimmy on the 8th episode of the series! No way!
Live footage of Jim joining the watchers
Jim had a little TOO much fun today...
This was so fun to watch, I’m glad you got to make one more appearance in secret life!  ✌🏻👏🏼
Jim is the kind of angel to ruin your social life but at least he'll keep you alive
I absolutely love this task itll be so cool if the next life season had a mechanic with ghosts, like if you kill somebody they follow you around on voice call ? idk this was very fun
WAIT BUT JIMMY IS OUT?!
I wish timmy had  turned on his mic and scared random people
I couldn’t stop smiling this video, it was so funny watching Jimmy react to how no one even batted an eye at grian being weird 😂
They literally are the little brother big brother duo.... whos who? You decide😂
YESSIR EP 7
Etho and Cleo are such great people
Still waiting for the "Climbing Into Conversation" podcast
I feel like this season is a bit more scripted than the others :D
He only didn’t get out first bc he had a mousepad
I saw this video and I screamed! It was so fun seeing you
The fact that no one notices is so funny, tim is there but still know one listens to him.
I watched ethos video first and none of the things grian were doing seemed weird. Just silly and grian like.
The absolute sheer joy jimmy had doing this is absolutely making my day
Jim coming back as a ghost to haunt Grian and tell him what to do so freaking great makes perfect sense Jimmy as the ghost love it LOL😂🤣
Really missed opportunity to give yourself yellow wings in the thumbnail! Why didn’t you do that Jim?!?!???
"The leaves are all pointing upward." *Etho and Cleo appear out of nowhere*
This was just what I needed, getting sick and all. Thanks for the laughs! <3
best ep in all the series for me
Please say the next season is Ghost Life, where people team up and alternate being the ghost guide.
Imagine if there was a task where a red was assigned the role as grave robber and could select 2 dead players to come back on for the episode but they have 1 life and must follow all commands
“The leaves are all pointing upwards.” -Grian, 2023
I know Jimmy and Etho in S6 and Jim just remembers this episode 9 minutes in
So hard not to laugh too loud at work 😂
I wish this episode was longer it was great! I didn’t want it to end. Hilarious 😂!
OMG JIMMY HAS AN EPISODE 8 WOWOOWOWOWOW THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
This was hilarious!
The zombie dance was hilarious and I watched Grian’s POV before yours and he cut out some of these moments
Knowing Etho's strategy has been to do weird things so people couldn't guess his task, he probably just assumed Grian was doing the same thing, on top off Etho just being a chill person in general and not minding other peoples business too much.
Amazing idea! 😂😊
i absolutely loved this! it was so wholesome!
Yeah angel…
It's funny how Jim is just like "Etho isn't reacting at all" like dude, he's * Canadian *, he's too polite to say anything lmao
Ain’t no way Jimmy got a pity episode
Grians voice was so panicked when he found out lol
I live for any sort of ghost pov of the life series! The ones BigB and Martyn released in 3rd life were so funny. It's like a bonus unique perspective on events!
I saw Grian’s episode first, and I didn’t realize Jimmy would upload his side!
EPISODE SEVEN IS REAL
This was super fun 😆😆
Is his name Jimmy or Timmy 😭
I feel so bad for grian LOL
4:20 THE GRIND STINE IS ETHO’S DISHWASHER
Coming here straight from Grian's video because I need more of this, I loved this session so much, the dynamic between these two mixed with this challenge is just perfect :D
This is the first time Jimmy is in Ep8 in this entire series 💀💀
I was wondering why Grian sounded slightly annoyed and grumpy. I assumed he was sick. I was close. :D
The Canary Curse didn’t work so he can’t leave the server xD
This is amazing lol
That book didn’t specify what type of angel you could be. A battle harder ark angel, cherubs, and falling angels
further evidence that tasks are planned individually and not randomised like they should be for a series like this...
Jim getting to experience what the later episodes of a life series feel like for the first time.
Best episode of all the players in the whole season
I would love to see a future installment of the Life Series use a gimmick where dead players can stick around as guardian angels for the living players.
my side hurts from laughing so hard.
I loved this task so much i am so happy your POV exists too
I thought this pointing upwards leaves was a distress call lol.
Martyn so sneaky even a cam account couldnt spot him
I love how the episode Jim comes back as a ghost, he technically dealt posthumous damage (Bdubs took 5.5 hearts from his glass water)
I saw "Secret Life" in the title and was so excited
Ethan
This episode is a dream come true 😍😂😂😂
I came from watching Martyn's POV and him getting caught suddenly made a LOT of sense. Good on you Jimmy.
this was so fun, i hope lizzie and mumbo get to be angels as well
We need this next week but we get 2 of them for 1 person one saying good things to do the other bad things. Like an angel and a demon on their shoulders. And the player must only do things either of them sugguest.
An extra episode 🥺🥺🥺 I’m so happy!!!
Guys someone explain the watcher lore of angel Jimmy to me
Ironically this is the most episode Jimmy has appeared in even tho he's a ghost.
Jimmy is with us in spirit... LITERALLY!
This was unexpected but so cool!!!
I love that the task was for Jim to just tell Grian what to do but he ended up telling Etho and Cleo what to do as well
This content i actually wanted
YESSSSS! YOURE BACK!!!
Just imagining Jimmy as a tiny little angel sitting on grians shoulder and giving him tasks
He was pretty much just being Grian's intrusive thoughts and Grian was forced to let them take over lmao
It was great to see you again, Jimmy! Thanks for swinging back around; I enjoyed it immensely <3 Your quick reactions were super cool; you just really have a great knack for picking up on what would be funny in the moment. Excellent work!
“Yes, it’s me, Jim. And I’m dead” what a way to start a video
This was so fun and silly, it’d probably be hard but i’d love to see more of this or a whole series like it
After all the nonsense Jimmy has had to do in Top Comment videos, I bet he has some good ideas for this episode.
Seeing an episode from spectator mode is actually really fun, not to mention this particular task was fantastic
This is why everyone loves etho
This was great 😂😂
I'm glad Jimmy gets a bit more time on the Life Server in a way.
This was genuinely hilarious from both your pov and Grian’s
The Canary Curse really couldn't stop you this season; Lizzie died first, and now even though you're out, you still get to mess with the server.
Whoever came up with that idea, that was genius to let a dead person come back as a ghost
14:14 - I like how Immy transformed into guardian angel here
Amazing video again Jimmy! Thanks for the wonderful content you bring! 💙💙💙💙
I love how around 8:25 you can see Joel building his trap because of the spectator mode
Lucky you. You got to have a bonus episode.
this was so good! i love how grian instantly and calmly said whatever jimmy told him to, no matter how weird it was.
THE MAN HAS RETURNED
How did you not see joel place the trap?
Etho is so nice he didn't even question any weird thing grian doing
I don’t know whether to watch this video or grian’s video first!!!
I haven’t actually laughter at, well anything, for ages. But this had me laughing so hard 😂
I just know the theorists are gonna love this
This was amazing. I was laughing all the way through 🤣🤣🤣 Etho being so cute and completely oblivious bless him ❤ Knock knock Whos there? Its a Its a who? Its a me. A grian.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy's face throughout the episode looks like Christmas came early!
im so glad it was grian who got the ghost task, because the two of you have such a fun dynamic. loved this episdoe, glad to have jim back even if only temporarily
You are vanished! :D
"He is like Obi Wan Kenobi: he is more useful dead than alive!"
This is the first time someone has uploaded a video on the life series after having run out of lives
afterlife, a server where everyone does this
forcing someone to be weird on this server literally has no effect.  People have been weird since day one.  Etho's first episode here was titled "Server full of weirdos".
He broke the curse so they granted him one last chance
etho is such a good sport god i love him so much 😭😭
It's like an April Fool's episode
The fan artists are going to have a field day with this one (Im talking about me I am the fanartist)
the way i SCREAMED when i saw this!!!!!!!!!! BIG MAN JIM'S BACK (kinda lol)
seeing Jimmy back in the life series is a surprise to be sure. but a welcome one
Red Task Suggestion: Challenge a player to a fight to the death. They can not decline it. You may show your book if you feel it's necessary.  I don't know what kind of rules you have for task suggestions but please make this happen it would be epic.  EDIT: Oh wait didn't realise I was in Jimmy's video
Ahhhh I loved this. I wish more life series incorporated the dead players in some way.
and like jesus, on the 3rd session HE CAME BACK
I had the same breakfast with Etho!! Honestly for the past few days.. Its been rough..
this episode was so funny from both of your perspectives. thank you for the laughs king. what skizz said in limited life about your comedic timing is so true and this episode is a great example of it
Kind of a redundant perspective, isn't it?
“This must be a surprise to you. Yes it’s me Jim, and I’m dead, but I’m coming back today” 😂😂 so glad they threw the little pup a bone and let him back in the series
Totally missed an opportunity to guess peoples numbers from a distance...js
the way i SCREECHED with glee, this is such a fun little suprise!! you surely stressed grian beyond grief, but you were niceeeeeee to him :)
He’s BACK!!!!
Getting Jimmy back for an episode was such a treat!
Jimmy's all about that content lol
I have a funny theory where the watchers didn’t kill Jimmy first because they already held a funeral for him and thought he was already dead. So when they saw that he was still alive after Lizzie they quickly took him out
After a long exam this is exactly what I needed to relax. So hilarious! This was great and thank you. Loved watching it!
I'm absolutely dying laughing at this. This is my favourite thing
Etho's just so chill
Wow. This is the furthest Timmy has ever gotten in one of these series!
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER!
He’s back!
I like how Timmy tries to embarrass grian but it backfires.
i just watched Grian’s episode and as soon as he got his task i IMMEDIATELY KNEW it would be jimmy xD
I was hoping we would get Jimmy’s POV of this!!!
I was wondering why I saw Jimmy log out while I was watching Scars episode
Now i know your guys are over task suggestions. But can we get a secret devil where a dead player encourages violence towards yellows.  The dead player would also have a task, if all yellows are extinct from the server they are resurrected as a red on 15 hearts (yes im rooting for a comeback)
This was so funny! Might be my favorite task so far!
Jim is the worst angel I've ever seen and I think we can all appreciate that
Somehow Secret Life is *really* starting to give me Good Omens vibes
This is the furthest that Jimmy has ever made it in a Life series. He may not be there in physical form, but he's there in spirit!
I don’t know why but having you get Grian to woof woof at Martyn really hit me in the feels 😆 i think it’s safe to same Martyn misses his Big Dog.
Jimmy and Grian basically had an Impractical Jokers bit in the Life Series! I’m not complaining
This is gonna spawn all sorts of -fanfiction- i mean lore
I think the title of the video is wrong, cause Jimmy definitely isn't an angel, in any sense of the word
This made me laugh 😂 I saw grian walk around and never expected this 😂 the best thing
I can’t wait for Martin’s lore for this 😮
You have an amazing sense of humor and such quick wit, big man Tim. Amazing job, super funny video! Loved it
The main thing that makes it basically impossible for anyone to realize this task is going on is almost everything tim suggested was just stuff grian would do anyway, grian tim joel and scar all have this like 4 brothers sort of dynamic when they play
I was hoping Jimmy would comeback as an angel
Lovely seeing more of Jimmy! +10 for Star Trek reference too!  I really think this should be the premise of the next life series. Some players as ghosts, or players that die become ghosts, and they get to interact with live players. Personally I think Extra Life would be an excellent name.
I wish this had been mumbo. He would have taken his role as guardian angel seriusly.
now i need to see the other povs. this was a great episode.
LMAO I love that the afterlife is somehow funnier than the other lives
Funny how the secret keeper allowed jimmy back as a ghost instead of letting rejoin in a different name with a mustache just like in the hardcore series grian did with scar and joel 😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that on stream before the secret life recording, we were roasting him that he won't be recording ...
JIMMY IS THE BEST!! SOOO WHOLESOME!!!
I can’t wait for Martin to find out about this
I was so surprised when i saw this
IW AS HOPING YOUD UPLAOD A POV. I WAS SO SO SO HOPING. I DIDNT THINK YOU WOULD BUT YOU DID!!!!!!!
This is giving watchers vibes🙏
OMG OMG OMG
this is so funny
I knew something was up when he had that urgency to finish his stream last monday...
Guess my fave YouTuber can be my first video like always
Nice
he’s a toy ghost
We getting out of the afterlife with this one🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯
"That was wholesome, that was nice."  No, that was Bdubs.. that's who he is lol..
Yay, you took my suggestion, sort of. Mine was eliminated players become minions,  but this was even better!
Joel in the chat 💪💪 16:17
so, this might be a wierd comment. but week 5 my school is doing the thing where you know, get to try out a job (i have no idea what it is in english). anyways i think you know where im going with this, i wanna do that with you bc it would be hilarious, pls?
Loved this episode! I hope you know that Joel was avenging you last episode by killing all the horses 😂
This was so funny episode, nice to see you got back as a ghost  for this episode : )
This is honestly such a good representation of Jimmy's quick wit. Every sort of situation Grian was in he managed to find something hilarious for him to do
no way no way its the long awaited episode 7 of secret life
Grian went through the 5 stages of grief at the start
13 Days ago i wrote this comment this on Grian channel.  "What if gray names can return as "ghosts" and do tasks good or harm thing for live ones, that can be interesting, more shananigans inc :D" But i think its realy good bring back fallen ones :)
" the ghosts all stay above the clouds and *watch* " whoa, Jimmy, you just created lore.
this is one of the best episodes to date 😂😭
This made my day!
I’m currently watching grians pov right now
Etho is such a sweetheart. Not questioning anything grian does lol.
Etho's task must have been: Jimmy is telling Grian what to do, act as if everything is completely normal
This is exactly what it’s like watching Impractical Jokers oh my god
Out of everyone to be paired together, Jimmy with Grian is the best because now Jimmy can torment Grian freely.
Jimmy fans are absolutely winning this season
9:00 Favorite bit in the episode.
Clawg just decided to come back
WOOO THIS IS SO EXCITING
Oh this was really cool!!! Ive always thought the ghosts should fly around and upload their perspectives anyway, being in spectator mode theyd have great views of battles and such.
YOOOO HES BACK!!!
NO WAY YOU POSTED A VIDEO ON THIS TOO
19:09 SHIT I’M GETTING FLASHBACKS… I THIS BRAIN ROT IS FAR TO INTENSE… I DON’T WANNA GO DEEPER…
jimmy's commands are too good and perfectly timed its so hilarious
I just watched grians I can’t wait to watch this!
i GASPED when i saw this notification
This is my absolute favourite episode ever I have laughed so hard the entire time 😂😂😂😂 love you man omg grian and jimmy 😂
Yes it was a surprise
OMG IM GOING CRAZY OVER THIS
Jimmy, you were more of a devil than an angel XD
This might go into the how did we get here playlist
Jimmy, you got stuck with grian... he does weird things all the time... OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GONNA REACT NORMALLY!! btw, love the video, this was hilarious!
it would be so cool if on the predicted last episode everyone got the task:   Kill (insert closest ally here). You cannot fail. If you die they succeed their task. You cannot attack with a weapon you must kill them in an unconventional way. E.g. fire, tnt, traps ect.   Everyone would have to pick between themselves or their friends and see who betrays who. It would also be interesting to see who killed themselves for their teammate to succeed and how may people would end up living. You could asine random people to kill or maybe individually pick someone for each person to make the session filled with more betrayal. e.g . etho and bdubs, tango and skizz, ect.
My brain stopped working for a minute before i clicked on the vid, but i loved this so much!!! You made me laugh a lot:)
Im watching this in class and im trying so hard to not laugh LMAO
When the world needed him the most, he came back
I watched Joel first and seeing him dig in the background without Jimmy noticing is absolutely hilarious XD
The fact that I watched Cleo’s POV first and nothing  Grian did struck out of the ordinary other than when Grian asked Etho what he ate for breakfast. I thought that was weird but nothing else until I saw this.
I’m sorry, I saw the title and went “huh???”   Great Birthday gift, Ty!
The Secret Keeper has let Jimmy live (via ghost) another day and he chooses to make it Grian's problem lmao-
10:05 the way etho just looks at him speechless
Etho probably thinks Grian is so absurd X>
Jimmy makes it to episode 8! (Kinda)
I got thrown off cause I thought I was watching Grian's video. 2 minutes and 20 seconds in and I realised that I was watching Jimmy's video. Cheers Jimmy!
after watching cleos and gems POV of the start little did i know there was a big man jim watching them😂😂😂😂
This is such a nice surprise! Jimmy returns! As a ghost!
Half canary half phenix! Yellow wings have become fire wings.
Ghost gang representing! 👻
Amazing idea
WHAT LMAOOO
OMG IM SOBBING IDK HOW IM SO HAPPY AHH
Something tells me that the Secret Keeper didn't like how the angel and devil quest from the previous session ended up
What the flip??
Today is my birthday and I was not expecting to see a post from Jimmy for secret life. This is the best birthday gift
Love this idea!
OMG WHAT A TWIST???? i did not expect this!!
A twist out of a M Night movie
This is hilarious! I'm loving it.
Coolio
Now this is amazing
NO WAYYYYY LET'S GO
HE DESCENDED INTO HELL; AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD AND ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN.
HAHDGAHHSHAHRHRHHA

I didn't expect this to happen I am literally shocked
Well well well, who do we have here
before 1k views gang
Jimmy and Grian are such brothers I swear! I love seeing them interact and seeing Jimmy get so excited to mess with Grian is always so funny
A bit? It’s a big surprise. Jimmy is down but he’s technically not out. ❤😂
So THATS why jimmy was chilling at the end of a bunch of other people's POVs
When you know jimmy actually died 3rd:
WHAT??? STOP IM SO HAPPY
RAAAAAAAAAH
HM?
NO WAY YOU DID THIS. NO WAY
“I might ignore you quite a lot of the time” 😂
