You have a keen eyes for fashion commentary, Bravo I loved. I thoroughly enjoyed your broadcast as always! Smashed
Catherine mother She’s well dressed♥️♥️♥️
Princes Mary from Denmark had a lovely shade of purple shoes. SO PRETTY! And Fumi you look beautiful❤
I liked it when the husband's ties  matched the wife's attire.  Your crown is adorable,  Lady Fumi.  🎉
Camellia husband ole wore the worse dress😂😂😂😂😂
I just want to say thank you for being kind to our new King and Queen who have dealt with so much hate. Also you look beautiful ❤
4:40 if looks could kill
This was nothing more then a ritual. They throw it in our faces all the time. Kate n her daughter wreaths was a nod to the Roman Empire. There was a woman with a sword. She had the Roman wreath on head n clothes. I have zero respect for these parasites!
Kathy Perry was the WORST dressed
Yaaaaasssss Fumi u look too beautiful i love it 👑👑👑👑😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
With the right figure you can't go wrong with pencil and the short shrug twist...amazing
Princess of Monoco's suit should have had a crop jacket and shorter skirt for that more youthful appearance and the color should have been brighter.
Katy Perry looked awful, that suit, was hideous. It looked as if she gained 10 pounds after it was fitted. Very tacky, typical of the Hollywood crowd.
10:14 thats how QEII Survived the 80s fashion
Every canary yellow dress was giving and then the hot pink ....ooh  do good
I have Noticed that Princess / Dutches Catherine has been. Called Catherine for a long Number  of years .  She was Kate at College &  in the Very early years of her Marriage to Prince William.   .  I think   Princess Catherine  has been Called Catherine  since Prince George was born & he is 10:years old now.  .  So I cannot be sure but I have. Been calling her Princess / Dutches Catherine  always but I have noticed  her Name changing  .  .  Well I feel whatever she is called ,  she is Hugely Respected  as she is so Respectful to everybody. Herself.  .   She is a Wonderful Person.  Dutches/ Catherine   God Willing. Future Queen. Of United Kingdom. ❤❤❤ 27:54
The headpieces that Kate and Charolette wore were made by a company started from the Prince's trust. (Charles started that fund with his military pension. To give youth from humble beginnings a chance to succeed.) It's lovely how he quietly supported his people, then showcased their talents and success later on. Those headdresses say so much, and are stunning beyond compare!
20:17 Queen Maxima’s dress is beautiful but isn’t it still inappropriate to wear white to weddings?
I love and live for your fashion reviews, Praise; Lady Marg. Armstrong -Jones for the fabulously outta phoox for the win. Thee most narliest outfit at a royal event, EVER. Wherever she went after the coronation, ....it was lit.
I would love to see you review some of Princess Diana's looks!
That’s probably the best I’ve seen Emma Thompson. That hair colour suits her a lot. She looked fresh and glowed
That coral ensemble was absolutely beautiful in shade and intricacies
Your lipstick color slays!
So much more class than any “Hollywood celeb event” with see thru and near nude garbage! These women all looked beautiful, well most of them, even the ones that didn’t look so hot still had class!❤
Absolutely looking fabulous Fumi! ❤
Thanks Ms Fumi. Queen of Lesotho 🇱🇸  we kinda say it like this “Le-sue-2” ❤
That's nice thank you at you are the only one who didn't went there to check Harry
I think they have colours of the day cuz they wore similar colours
Charlene of Monaco deserved better, she's a beautiful, statuesque woman... i always love Catherine, Mary of Denmark and Queen Rania. They ARE elegance! The queen of Bhutan is stunning and i always appreciate traditional gowns as is the case of Kiko of Japan.❤❤❤❤
I was completely here for THIS!!! YOU LOOKED AMAZING AS WELL...
Bravo! and you were so right about Caroline Middleton’s dress. I was expecting the York sisters to wear those weird hats that they used to wear ( maybe the husbands put a stop to those hilarious hats).  I didn’t care about Q. Letitia’s bowl hat.  She is still a pretty lady to be hiding her semblance under that ugly hat.
I  like  your  style  i  like  the  way  you  talk  very   nice
I liked your exciting analysis 🙏💖☮️🕊️
Love your couture comments n I agree to your taste...🤗
We live for that Crown Fumi
Thank you for loving our Queen'outfit
My Queen is only Princess Diana ...i don't who is Camila
Matilde of Belgium.  Almost perfect.  Notice that the dress was little in the up front.
Zara Tindall, one of the best!!!
Totally agree with Maxima
Mette Marit, her dress were litlle!!! It was not her size!
You are very "soft", some dresses were "good" but with unforgivable mistakes.
Oh please..no children. No birthday. When are people going to give up their lies
The are classy not trashy. Unlike Americans who loves to show the body they bought.don’t know how to dress appropriately.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The dresses you thought were frumpy are quite British, that is their style!
This is my first time viewing your channel.  You are a very nice and very beautiful lady.  My late husband, an artist and jewelry designer, also made a crown for me.  I wear it whenever i want to feel him especially close to me.  Wishing you peace, tranquility and joy.  Regards⚘️
I have noticed you  completely ignored our Morocco's her Royal Highness, princess Lalla Mariam accompanied by her son, in a beautiful  embroidered silk pale pink cantankerous, but unfortunately wore a white cape over it, which hid the beauty of the caftan! She really looked regal!!!
Prince Harry should have brough his children. How awful for them to miss such an event in their grandfather's life. That's not fair to them, it's so sad what the adults have done.
I don’t care
You know what King, Charles and his wife should have never been king and queen. His mother wrote a letter stating that fact and they know it they stole that William disappear. Shame yourself, Kate I really truly feel sorry for you get a divorce from that man because you don’t deserve to have him in your life you’re better off without him. You understand Prince Harry and Duchess Megan I love you I love you I love you. You are the best and your mother see that in you I am so happy and so proud of you making your own way your own lifestyle and your brother hates that I am so happy for you and your mother is looking down. your mother is looking down on you with angels 😊😊😊
What about the men?? Is fashion for women only??!
"The 50 year old..."  I think you can say it, if people who don't know, find it hard to believe! In this instance, that is the case!
The Royals from Europe and Africa were well represented.  What about the middle east??
No NO NO ..SHE IS NOT QUEEN OF UNITED KINGDOM.... CAMILLA SHE IS ONLY QUEEN CONSOLE
Jill and Camilla looked awful.  Jill is a jerk of First Lady of embarrassment. Camille has no rights being there at all.  Charles is at fault just like Camille is when breaking a marriage and deeply hurting a  Diamond of a wife and 2 great sons. I don’t see how Camille has the nerve to show her face and smile.  But then she’s worked hard to climb the ladder to success no matter how she did it.   Spoiled jerk and a gold digger mistress slut. Life has seriously hurt Prince Harry and Prince William.   They hold their hurt in different ways.   William is holding it in for the Monarchy, his late Gan Gan, Queen Elizabeth.  Harry has been holding the sadness in for years and letting it out now.  But Meghan isn’t helping at all. But even if Meghan wasn’t in the picture, Harry still has lousy memories, deep hurt on his mind for years and now Camille has been brought in by Charles even when his sons begged him not to marry her.  They’re precious Mom got hurt bc of Charles and Camilla.    Camille finally got her wish. She wants the popularity that Princess Diana had and from British network, she’s not getting it. Charles also wants more popularity bc Princess Diana always received it and he didn’t like that.  No one is perfect.  We’re all sinners but Camille snd Charles shouldn’t have done damage and Camille being around doesn’t feel good.
Fumi,I can comfortably say,you live for anything fabulous😊..Am I right?
You were way too kind lol the queen of lesotho was the only wow factor for me the rest were just ok except for katy perry,  Eugenie and her sister their taste is just not for me
She is Queen console not the QUEEN😢
Hail to Queen Fumi! You are so beautiful 😍
Kate looked so beautiful
It was very gratifying to see a South African commentating on the guests arriving at the Coronation.
Katy Perry looks like a hot mess.  That suit is ill- fitting. Princess Charlene of Monaco looks washed out; she needed something to brighten her up.
I loved this commentary. So positive.
Fumi our African sister  you make us proud😍
My Mothers name was Beatrice, one of her cousins named Eugenie
There are many more royal families that were not invited from many countries perhaps not the best of buddies with Great Britain.
Girl, your deep voice is giving me Grace Jones and I love it!
Fumi this was so entertaining , and your eye for style and fashion is impeccable !
Carol is  Kate and pipas
love this woman
I love hats ! Wish America would adopt them. So fun !
Thank you my Queen . You looking stunning and fabulous as always ❤❤❤❤❤
Love your Tiara or Crown ❤
Carol's dress looks like the 1940s with those shoulder pads.  The headband was too young, pulled back with statement earrings would have been better like you said.
Prince looks great.
I love your exquisite taste in fashion. What is also appealing is that you are not mean with your certain fashion dislikes. You are tasteful, not tacky in your constructive criticism. I am definitely subscribing!
You look smashing! Hello from California🌞
Its very elegant but the golden piece on your head  is a tiara if anything, crowns are a Full circle and in the UK only worn by Royalty, [Queen Elizabeth's family  and so forth.].
Thanks!
Why are there Prince/Princess of Greece? They do not have a Kingdom.
The Best Dressed for me are: Zara Tindall, Mrs Biden, Queen Letizia, Queen Matilda
Former British PM Tony Blair's wife looked absolutely AWFUL
Prince Charles? Camilla?
I make no apologies but Jill Biden looks like she's trying to dress too much like a monarchy
Countries with monarchy  Britain 🇬🇧 Norway 🇳🇴 Sweden 🇸🇪 Denmark 🇩🇰 Netherlands 🇳🇱 Belgium 🇧🇪 Spain 🇪🇸 Luxemburg  Monaco 🇲🇨 Liechtenstein 🇱🇮 Japan 🇯🇵 Thailand 🇹🇭 Morocco 🇲🇦 Swaziland 🇸🇿 Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 Kuwait 🇰🇼 Qatar 🇶🇦 Bahrain 🇧🇭 UAE 🇦🇪
❤️You look beautiful Fumi ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fabulous
Zara’s look is definitely my favorite. The collar!? Yes!
You are slaying this top and crown
I contend Harry’s wife - Megan would had slayed with her dress too 💙💛
"I live for it!" ❤️
She doesn't even sound Nigerian, she sounded more like a Gambian or a Sierra Leonean.
Officially Consort.
Thank you Fumi I wore my crown also😊❤❤❤❤
Hello my lady you always looking  fabulous
Katy Looked absolutely gorgeous from Aussieland
What would make Charlene of Monaco look wonderful…..divorce. Yes, I said it.
I enjoyed you pointing out the details of their dresses. I liked how you stayed positive. I liked Sarah’s dress simple but elegant.  I like the visitors from other countries wearing traditional outfits.
Queen Mathilde stress matched her husband’s royal pink sash, they look great together!
Queen maxima really looked wonderful!
Finnigan & Jill Biden were wearing the colors of the Ukraine flag!
Princess Charlene’s outfit was almost elegant the sleeves were too loose and wrinkly and she cannot wear a skirt with a slit as her calves are way too wide to make it look attractive all said and done I think she is an attractive woman.
Fumi my dear , you are more put together than Katy Perry and First lady Biden.
I just love your energy 🎉 Thanks for the fabulous video
You have good fashion sense. You are right that the European royals support each other. They are still bound by the pledges their countries took at the 1884 - 1885 Berlin Conference in which 14 countries met to decide which European countries would invade which parts of Africa to steal its natural resources--its diamond, gold, petroleum, rubber--you name it. I see no beauty here--just the results of colonial exploitation.
Thank you so kindly for giving A positive response to Jill Biden's outfit for the Coronation. I thought she looked wonderful.
Lovely broadcast. This is my first time watching you and you enthusiasm is so uplifting. I will be tuning in again very soon. Much love.  ❤
Hablas mucho y no dices nada
I agree with your assessment of Carol Middleton’s attire 100%.  Too much around her neck.
Yes to Queen Maxima, she always brings it  and her dress was stunning,  and of course Letizia, who never puts a foot wrong, looked impeccable ☘
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Princess of Monaco has some mental health issues like depression. It's a blessing that she got there in one piece.
You are wonderful to listen to! Thank you this was great!
Who is Archie.....
It is nothing but a show of from people who needed to be in the center of everything, high society never made the world happy or safe.....it takes more than they can give....or want to give.....
Youare correct  super coronation longlived ourgently ki g
You fabulous in your crown.  Hail Queen Africa.
Hi where is prince Qatar and his wife
Camilla????? 😂
I think Crown Princess of Denmark was one of the best dressed there! Princess Mary looked stunning!
hello this is not queen camila.camila is just a companion not a queen.
If I had Katy Perry’s bank account and Orlando Bloom in the bedroom I would wear whatever the heck I wanted and you naysayers could all stuff it! 😂😂😂
A beautiful presentation. Thank you……..
I love your crown and your programme was excellent 🎉🎉🎉
I think Jill Biden's gloves are too much.
Queen of Lesotho had the absolute most gorgeous dress.
ELEGANCE is exuded from within…sparked by simplicity. No amount of “bling-bling” apparels can actualize that.
Katie Perry's outfit was too busy. 😊
Beautiful Fumi  I Love Your Outfit, Thank you for Sharing❤
I love ABFAB
Fab!!! And you are so Fab!!!!!
He wanted her to be her tampon when he was married to Diana.  I don't feel this guy at all!  Ask Elton John what he thinks of this infidel.
I love Fumi's fabulosity!
Queen Camilla.. ..but “ “wonderful wife???
Jill Biden, “Fell short of expectations.” So has her husband. Instead of showing up with her granddaughter, Biden should have attended.
Zara, Pippa and Sunaks wife won!
Queen of Lesotho’s hat looks like a bird’s nest.
Hi! Thanks for describing the outfits ! 💕
Máxima, Letizia and Rania. Always 👏🏼 bring 👏🏼 it👏🏼. Flawless, always, without fail
This is true “ The York sisters  style Is changing since marriage” and also since Duchess of Sussex arrived on the scenes” Yes away from dear mother dressage’” Sorry Duchess of York “ though you you lights up any room.
Katy Perry’s outfit was odd looking and too tight fitting. It bunched up in the waist and across the hips. The rest of the outfits I totally agree.
Jill looked frumpy like her personality.
I personally think Jill Biden dress can be better looking if the neck line to is a bit lower. Just an inch or two would be it
My favourite vlogger..👍
Katie Perry was a mess. Charlene of Monaco let her country down unlike Queen Leticia who was stunning
Prince Harry was not wanted. He is a national disgrace.
Hello my sister Fumi, Thank you for the great representation your news always excellent God bless you sis💜
👑👑🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾🖤🖤💜💜🧡🧡❤❤🖤🖤💜💜🧡🧡❤❤✌🏾✌🏾
Which kind mumu dress be this
I hate to said, it’s all old style of royal family
Just stumbled upon this video. Thank you Lady Funmi…such a wholesome review.
Traditional garments of Bhutan, Japan and Mrs. Eva Omaghomi were outstanding; Absolutely loved them. "Well-done!"💕
Every one was very beautifuly  dress.❤❤
Katie perry looked great
Miss Fumi, Work that crown, Mama!!!! Ur Faboulous!!!!!
Olá  bom dia !  Penso quê  se à  duquesa MEGHAN  estivesse participado da coroação  ela iria está  com looks  deslumbrantes 👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾
All of them is at their best only others dont fit your taste ...
You’re just good. Well done
Princess Charlene has not been well.
I love your top
I guess Katie didn’t get the memo - she wasn’t supposed to dress in costume!  Lol. Stay in your lane Katie, might need another fitting.  You can’t make this up.
This Beautiful Crown fits the Queen her. Self. Long live Aunt 💃FEMI❤️
I was just waiting for that coral outfit near the end. I want it!
Katy Perry's dress was a flop.
You all need to quit referring to Princess Kate as your future queen. If Prince William is like his dad he'll divorce her to marry is past lover/concubine 😮 then give England another dowdy Queen Camilla type woman. Just like Princess Diana Kate is beautiful! Charles didn't stick around for beauty and maybe William won't either .  Jus' sayin'
IT IS NOT THE PRICE OR THE BRAND AND CREATOR OR THE KIND OF FABRIC THAT MAKES A DRESS STAND OUT----- IT IS ALWAYS THE CARRIER. (This is where Princess Diana stands out...  remember her neckpace which stood highly praised when she used it as head band?)
The wrong queen too is a worst dresser.. no matter how simply gorgeous or explicitly  gorgeous the clothes are.. once Camila wears them... The clothes always appear  to be "house dress" or p.j
Absolutely correct about the awful dress by The Beautiful Monaco's Princess Charlene!  Queen Rania  Queen Leticia looking great   Princess Victoria looking Regal    Great coronation, loved watching the best dresses.
First time viewer. Loved this show! Subscribed right away. Love from USA !
I live for the moment Fumi said Nairobi Blue ❤❤ I am from Nairobi Kenya and Lupita is our girl. Love you Fumi
They have all what on the backs of slaves...Jamaica wants their island back and Africa want their diamonds back,,,colonizers at it's finest 😅
Fumi you are so beautiful! Love to hear your lovely voice
I think it's quite the sham Camilla is queen. Personally I think Charles shouldn't be king either. The title should have went to William. Princess Dianna has passed but Charles was divorced. He SHOULD NOT BE KING
Katie Perry's suit was SO sad! The color was great. The suit itself was lovely but it simply did not fit.  The jacket was too tight around the middle (button strain). The neckline was made for someone perhaps bustier(?)  as it looked saggy. The skirt was too tight as well. It clearly was not altered to fit her.  Her hat should have been tilted back just a smidge to not block her eye-line.
Jill Biden looked very stylish.❤️❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Fumi, I stumbled onto your channel for the first time today, and I ❤❤❤❤❤❤ you Queen!!!!👸🏿  You gave me life today.  Sub!   I agree that Katie Perry looked Fab!-Beau!!!  You were spot on with your assessments.  Keep giving us you my sister.  Thanks!
Queen Letizia is an icon of beauty. She is always fashionable. ❤ Favorite Queen.
Jill Biden needed a brooch or something
This should have been LadyD‘s Crown !
Letizia’s hat looked like a salad bowl
Katy’s dress was too small
I hoped that all the countries would wear their traditional garments! So disappointed by that.!
Disagree with your assessment of Katie Perry and Jill Bidens outfits.They were both awful. Spains' Queen looked immaculate. I love Denmarks Princess Mary . She always looks stunning. Zara Tindall looked so pretty, the best I've ever seen her, too  Agree with Princess Charlene , she was a hot frumpy mess. She was so beautiful at her Wedding, but is very unhappy in her marriage and it shows in her general presentation  My favourite Outfit of the Day was Penny Mordaunt, beautiful Colour and style for her role.
To me; every outfit was fabulous!
Agree agree agree ❤❤❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 love your energy, you are gorgeous
I just loved your commentary. Beautiful crown on you😍😍
Have enjoyed your commentary so much more than others' who were also critiquing the clothes. Some were unduly harsh on outfits that you really liked, and that I really did too. There were very few i didn't like.
Hail to my Queen of Lesotho!! all the guests looked beautiful.
What a Fabuuuulous Review. Really enjoyed you’re commentary and technical detailed analysis.  I live for you darling ❤
My queen - queen of Lesotho - last presented made me smile as always. Keep it up ur majesty
Kate looks a hard 55
Oh Fumi, I just came across your video! You are not old, you look beautiful and elegant.  Veey knowledgeable a out fashion.
You're very polite about everyone thank you so much
It's  refreshing to see a page were woc can appreciate  fashion here without having to feel guilty for doing so, or being called a coon. Thanks Fumi!
Sara's dress  is Beautiful!, I think her dress inspired by Japanese Kimino 👘
I just found your fun channel.  Have you've lived in the US?  I hear an American accent slipping in and out of your voice.
The colonizers ball yayyyy 🙄🙄🙄
God and KING YESHUA  never bothered about what to wear
I believe princess Charlene has been ill the past couple of years??? May be why shes not looking her best.
JUST GET ON WITH IT  !!!
Fumi, YOU are royalty!! I recommend you sleep in your crown!!😊 I just love you. I laugh I learn I laugh!!😅😅
honestly speaking. the king and the queen looks kind of grotesque 😅 all these capes and furs😂 they are giving me magicians from the circus😅
What a joyous, lovely lady you are!  I just happened to stumble upon your channel, and I just loved your positive energy & your genuinely kind words for your subjects .. Some ladies can be very petty when discussing other ladies' fashion choices - but not you!  You're an absolutely delightful commentator to watch - Thank you for spreading your joy with us - you have yourself a new subscriber! Kindest regards from Australia 🇦🇺❤️🇬🇧😍
I think the time for referring to Catherine, Princess of Wales with the familiarity of 'Kate' has long passed ... She is a future Queen and she deserves to be shown the respect of being called Catherine henceforth.
jill bidens dress should be  called ukrainian blue .... and her granddaughter wore ukrainiant yellow to show their support for ukraine ............ shame she was supposed to be there representing the United states of america................  i am so glad they were seated in the last row next to the toilets
I think the Bidens should have swapped outfits.  Yellow cape thing would have been better on a mature woman.
I am sorry to say there wasn't any birthday she went hiking with friends the pictures was out does she  think people is fool
YOU look great, you have a new silhouette!  Beautiful.  And LONG LIVE THE KING.
You’re a beauties inside and outside
Fumi you are beautiful but you are wrong Camilla is wonderful or beautiful. She is a fake
I'm surprised our stylists still put these shoulders today. Awful Never looked good.
Katie Perry was a hot mess. Nice colour though. Princess Beatrice dress was nice but her head piece was slighly heavy. Half the size of it could have been perfect
Fumi, I ❤ your crown and top!! You are looking so beautiful!
They have known  each other since their teens!
maxlma can wear anything it seems!!! she is stunning and i usually love brunette hair more..
Some of these ladies bust line needed a lot of help....
i love queen leticia dress but the hat was way to big.
You look absolutely gorgeous and beautiful  today. Well always but love your sparkle today.
When I see Finnegan Biden in reminded tjay she was a classmate to Sasha Obama! So much time had flown by. She looked fantastic!
Your queen funnie
Loved this … you look fabulous with your crown
The Katy Perry outfit would have been lovely but it seem to be tight on her.
Penny was my best
Most looked really nice and regal but I was waiting for my African Royals. Happy to have seen the Queen of Lesotho. She looked lovely. Wish she wore some  of the diamonds that come from Lesotho. Surprised to have missed King Mswati of Eswatini. I wish our African Royal families could be more visible.  Great review. My favourite part was seeing Joanna Lumley from Absolutely Fabulous. It was one of my all time favourite comedy's.........
Jill Biden looked like crap... compare Jill's RL dress to the one Melania wore when Trump was inaugurated Melania  left Jill in the dust!
Jill Biden looked awful....nice color - she did not look good she looked like Harry crumpled and un kept. Jill Biden was not "Sharp"
I must comment on Jill B. she dressed much better than usual but it just looked like a business suit with rubber gloves and a bow in her hair.  She should have least worn a hat like the pill box hat that Jackie Kennedy and Melania Trump work.  I think she should have found something more dressy for a coronation.
Well deserve that’s right auntie Fumi
Because the NBC coverage was live, you can pinpoint the time you pass before they are cameras are they cameras pass before you you were standing still in and looking to the side, so as a profile coming into a face front view, and it was after the Royals had left the balcony, they may have just left the balcony   so trying to find that time frame on. I'll look back on NBC's YouTube and see if I can scan that moment in the crowd I know it was you.!!! and   you don't even know that you're on there unless someone else told you
at the coronation i daw you in the balcony-watch scenes on NBC coverage. You wore a fascinator British flag  motif. I RECOGNIZED YOUR PROFILE, CHEEKBONES & MAKEUP instantly.  That clip must be found🎉💃🏽👑
Great review!. I love watching your videos. You are so full of energy and happy. You make me happy!
Kate's mom dress was fabulous. Your comments were wrong. You still need much much .....more skills and experience to comment on fashions.
Catherine "crown" resembles that of Napoleon's coronation!!
Thailand
You are absolutely delightful to listen to. Loved your review. Kind to the ones that didn’t hit the mark. Great suggestions for improvement. I’ve subscribed to your channel. ❤️
Fumi. Might I say that you are looking fabulous in the crown. You remind me of a beautiful African queen! Or a beautiful dark skinned Nefertiti of Egypt. I lived for it!
Princess Catherine and Princess Charlotte looked absolutely beautiful.
The Queen of Greece seemed  sad.
Thank you for complementing Dame Ann.I really loved her outfit.
I think  Katherine's mother  was classic. I wish,she  had worn pearls. maybe a pillbox hat,but I loved her outfit.  She wasn't trying to be the mother of the bride  but respectful to the occasion.  Remember, it wasn't sure,if Katherine's family  would be there
Pippa, and Meghan look alike.  I think they may actually be related through their fathers .
Queen Fumi❤️❤️
I actually thought the Princess of Monco was very elegant. I loved, her draped  shawl  99.9 of the Royal World Wives,were very elegant and graceful.
Your lipstick is so gorgeous, Ms. Fumi!!  I’d love to know the brand and the color.  I loved your fashion commentary, too.  The best I’ve heard.  Love, love, loved Penny Mordount’s teal outfit; absolutely stunning.
You look like a beautiful royal Queen Yah bless you
You look lovely.
Princess Beatrice of York, her Father is Andrew not Edward.
Not my king. God bless Harry! Thank God he got out of that cult!
I agree with your ratings on these beautiful outfits!
Jill looked like she borrowed melanias outfit that Melania wore for trumps inauguration. Lmao
❤I love that you said nice things about the dresses 👗
Yes our queen Maxima❤
Yes that orange is fire😍
I totally agree with the best dressed. Yeas
Most looked old to me only a few were nice.
You are so beautiful
Thanks for the fashion round-up.  I know keeping the British royal family straight can be tricky sometimes.  Lady Helen Taylor is a cousin of the King, not the Queen, and Zara Tindal is indeed the daughter of Princess Anne and niece of the King.  Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are also nieces of the King and daughters of Prince Andrew, Duke of York.
You are such an inspiration for little girls of color. Www have tea and sandwiches and watch all your episodes. Thank you.
I loved your video so much, I had to subscribe  And I love your beautiful top ❤
Lupita is so extraordinary beautiful, in that pale blue dress she looked like an angel.  The depth of her skin against the paleness of the blue was exquisite, and I've not seen anyone equal this look.
Katy Perry looks  like the "Mrs Wiggins" character  from the Carol Burnett Show skits. KP wandering  around the church searching for her seat, looking clueless in that cheap , ill-fitting dress.
Queen Jetsun  ....so beautiful
Fumi, this is my first visit to your channel. You are marvelous! I appreciate seeing all the guests and their attire up close.
Queen Letizia always dress very nicely. I think she and Princess Kate Middleton have somewhat the same style. Just beautiful.😊
You look absolutely gorgeous. Amazing
I didn't miss any UK official ceremonies because I like to see those colorful well designed and beautiful dresses, hats .....which I can't see elsewhere on occasions .❤❤❤❤❤
I'm sorry but Katie perry looked a hot mess she could have done better.
First time finding your channel. It's excellent.  Adore all your discriptions of the outfits. You look lovely as well ❤️‍🩹
Fumi we need a little mermaid fashion review 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽❤️❤️❤️
GOD SAVE THE KING 👑 👑👑👑♥️ You look great FUMI!!! The Entire Royal family and all guests looked fabulous 🤩
Love you Fumi your Vibs is always life
Lovely … beautiful presentation… thank you. Enhanced my knowledge of the Royals.🌺
Fumi hello, it's  time you made your makeup  line instead  of selling  others  people. For real.
I'm so glad you also covered the men's attire.
You look beautiful ❤
Meghan did not stay home because of the children. She could have packed them up, get on Tyler Perry’s plane and be there in hours. She did not come because she hate what was done to her in England. She is tired of the hate mongers and have decided to take charge of her narrative. She did not come because she didn’t think the RF was worth it. That’s a boss move.
Femi you are beautiful
She is not Queen Camilla‼️Her title is  Queen Consort‼️
Thank you for complimenting our queen Maxima,Fumi❤
I Love how you describe everything  You are sweet, and you accent, my God! Gorgeous ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Finally, a proper review of the coronation fashion. Loved every minute of this event, hats off to the UK. When it comes to pageantry nobody comes close. Back to your review, spot on...  Just like the days of the legendary Joan Rivers!  I actually liked what Mrs. Middleton wore, but other than that I agree with every single one of your points. The outfits were stunning. All the ladies looked spectacular, and most of the men too. Very entertaining channel, thanks for this. x
My sister Fumi you are a queen and you can wear a Crown every day! You are simply gorgeous. Thank you for the entertainment.
I 💕 ked the suit, Charlene wore.
Queen Maxima for the win! I love her entire ensemble!
Love your constructive comments. Beautiful ❤
How about Her Majesty Queen Jetsun Pema of Bhutan?🤔🇧🇹 She is young and beautiful and always dresses impeccably.
Now I need a crown too❤
katy pery's dress was ill fitted i thought. i did not live for it
Thank you for being so nice when critiquing women's clothing.  Others have been mean, while you have looked for positives in each one.🇦🇺😊♥️
Why no highlight of the Asantehene and Lady Julia of Ghana?  This was much better than the Met Gala.  Really shows how classy, well-dressed people look.
You should have been invited too, you are a Queen x
Theyre all ugly
Queen of Fumination...we live we love
OMG FUMI! My niece's little 3 year old daughter came and saw me watching your video on my phone and said..." LOOK! BUUTIFUL PRINCESS!" She saw you on the screen🤗
For a coronation I wish no one wore large hats. Most outfits I liked.🇦🇺😊♥️
The princess of Jordan most elegant also the one for Denmark . The big hats take away the beauty of the others, and of course the US ladies.
cornflower blue was a lovely color for jill,but the gloves looked silly ,as an american,she was a poor representation for america,Melania Trump is our real first lady and is the true meaning of beauty class and style,and yes grace,first time here,and may i say i admire your choice of words and how you keep it positive,
Who are you? How have I not seen you before? You are fabulous! I love how your commentary is kind…even when offering criticism.
“wonderful” wife?? I don’t think so.
I skipped around looking for Harry's fashion commentary. I hate to say it, but he is the only one I like to hear about.
A beautiful crown.
Fumi u look lovely and  might I day slimmer
You look so elegant and refine wearing you crown just love you ❤❤❤. Your makeup was on point. Hats off to you my African queen.👍👍💯
The Queen of Lesotho looked totally terrific. Lady Louise looked beautiful. Pippa was perfect. Princess Charlene's outfit was not flattering, but it was lovely to see her attend in spite of a serious medical condition
I' m a proud member of Fumi nation. I love you girl.
Like this if you can see it at 24:10 XDDDD I love you Fumi!!!
Well of course they should support each other after all most of them are distant cousins .    It was the colours for me lovely .
What an absolute delight stumbling into your channel 💜❤️💜 Your narration is elegant & eloquent, how have I never seen you before? I’m a UK expat living in Canada, hearing other ppls point of view is fascinating, especially about our Royals 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Penny looked amazing. Best dressed on the day imo.
You look beautiful. Everything poppin❤️
You have a keen eyes for fashion commentary, Bravo I loved. I thoroughly enjoyed your broadcast as always! Smashed
My dear Fumi, I’m a 60 year old veteran who has never been into fashion, or the various fashion sites but as we have just had the best historical weekend I’ve been going through various sites and You came up….I’d just like to say “LADY, YOU ARE A PLEASURE TO WATCH. You discuss fashion but unlike everyone one else who has a point of view!!! You my darling are a RESPECTABLE CARING FUNNY KNOWLEDGEABLE LADY and you look AMAZING. It makes a fantastic change to hear someone who doesn’t feel the urge to be rude about everyone…..I will be back to see you again my darling xx THANK YOU to your parents who obviously gave you your sense of respect.
Not being mean, but I honestly thought Katy Perry looked awful in that outfit.  It was way to tight and didn't suit or fit her. She was a hot mess.
You are perfect in every way! Such beautiful makeup and your skin is flawless. Great video.
You look fabulous. Great makeup, updo, tiara. You wearing that top is out of this world. I think only you can make it look so beautiful.
You forgot the Romanian royals 😊
The royals in Europe are all related to Queen Victoria
Queen Maxima of Netherlands was the most beautifully dressed among all.
Madam, you’re gorgeousness yourself…
I'm glad that you highlighted the persons of diversity and color as well and not just the European royalty
I've been waiting for someone to show the lady from Africa he dress was by far the best, she looked beautiful❤
TUMI!  I just discovered you! You are fabulous!
Hn Fumi prince Harry facial expression explains how he wished his mom our beloved princess Diana was the one to be crown as the queen.Actually when camila was crowned i myself my facial expression changed not only  prince Harry because this crown would have fit our belloved Princess Diana.We will forever miss princess Diana hmmm
Why do ladies wear big hats? They should care about other people and they should wear small hats.
First off, Ms. Fumi, you are gorgeous and have outstanding bone structure!  My thoughts on the fashion of the day:  Harry looked like he slept in his suit.  No excuse.  But the poorest fashion choice he makes is the sullen look on his face.   Katy Perry's hat was wonderful, but her pink suit looked overworked and cheap.  The gold dress she wore at the concert looked like a Werther's hard candy wrapper.  The bodice of Jill Biden's suit was bulky at the top and needed tailoring.  The ridiculous bow in her hair was a "mutton dressed as lamb" choice if I ever saw one, and her gloves were about two sizes too big which made them look like the gloves under my kitchen sink.  Lady Gabriella Windsor was my absolute favorite!  She, much like her paternal grandmother, Marina, Duchess of Kent, and her paternal aunt, Princess Alexandra, Lady Ogilvy, is always elegant and impeccably dressed.  The hat was fabulous, and I loved the nude heels, shoes and gloves with the bright pink dress. What a wonderful day it was!  I'm an American, but I do say, "Love live the King!"
I wish Nigerians could show these people what real Majestic fashion really is. I was thoroughly bored by most of the outfits. I craved African glamour, and I got it in the Queen of Lesotho 💫💫
LOVE SEEING PRINCE HARRY !
Love your crown.
you look Amazing in GOLD, you said you would wear Chantal Miller's outfit, lest see.....
I like what you did there on Penny's dress towards the end 😄
Love Joanna Lumley!
You are 100% correct! Zara is the daughter of Princess Anne.
Queen M of Netherlands always brings it.
❤   I liked the black woman, you said Director? I liked her outfit best. I think she looked beautiful in deep rose pink.
Pffft get it right megan went hiking no sign of Archie or lilbet any where
King Charles, not Prince Charles
Fumi you look like a real Queen  with that crown and agree with your comments about the dresses of the attendees of this event.
You look as beautiful  as well
"His Wonderful wife"? We will agree to disagree. I remember how she got there. So, do many of us. A young woman was psychologically tortured by those 2. Those two being Charles and Camilla. The party who was hoodwinked into the marriage was Princess Diana. Adultery should not EVER be rewarded. They married? Fine. But, down to them? Hell to the NO. Anointed in the church with Holy oil? That's disgusting and sacrilege. This undermines the Church. This is why people are gradually turning against religion. Fumi....I hope you're doing this to be political. And this is not how you really feel towards Camilla. Those are not nice people, at all. They played Diana for years. And Charles started it. He knew better. No way to put a lipstick on that gross situation. Children were robbed of their previous Mother. She indirectly died as a result of the situation and actions of Charles and Camilla. It's Evil. How do you think God sees it? You have shared that you have a strong faith in our creator? How do you think 🤔 he feels about this situation? Excuse length. I'm just a bit surprised you praised Camilla the way you did.
Loved the traditional wear from other countries, especially the king and queen of Bhutan.
Love your head piece !,  you look lovely
Love your vibes Fumi. Your are best in what you do👌🏾
Fumi you look wonderful  in your crown, I love the makeup and the top , so beautiful.
Wonderful video!
I just found your channel and you are beautiful!!  Thank you for not bagging on my fav Prince Harry❤
Love your crown, dear Fumi ❤
Gorgeous as always 😍🙏🏾❤️
I’m not sure how a came upon you this evening, but I’m glad I did. I have to say, you are absolutely stunning!
Princess C looked like a Goddess!!!!!
I loved your reviews
I did not like the outfit of the British Prime minister. It looks too simple, boxy, flumpy and shapeless. No effort at looking fabulous!
I dint like queen letizias look . she looks like  a  lamp shade
They don't love Camilla Parker -Bowles
Lady Fumi, a fabulous video showcasing the stylish  attire of the attendees to , yes, King Charles lll’s Coronation.  There, I said it!   But yes! I was all for this Vlog. It was the pomp and circumstance for me!!!   What a wonderful ceremony. As one commentator said, “ the Brits do it best!” I have to agree.
Hadn't seen the ceremony or pics so glad you posted this. The minute 1st Lady Biden popped on the screen I instantly thought "Jacke O" attempt. But this was a fabulous review darling Fumi.  But YOU'RE the best dressed love. You look amazing with your crown!
Queen Letizia stole the show.
Long live Queen Fumi! ❤❤. Love it and live for it.
I like queen Rania 10:27
You look lovely yourself and I like your cute crown!  I love all the positivity!
First time seeing you and have to say your a really beautiful lady. I love your makeup and that colour of dress on you is perfect.
There was a lady towards the end that was dressed in pink that looked like a large confection. I wanted to eat her hat. Don't know who she was.
Wonderful wife. Are you kidding me 🤨. But I digress. You look amazing as usual. That was Andrewws daughters not Edwards
Beautiful
IN MY VIEW So many beautiful women with so many beautiful dresses and accessories. The problem I kept seeing was the dresses were not cut and sewn to fit their bodies propertly. Many, many sewing flaws. You pay a lot of money to wear a designer's dress......That designer needs to make sure it looks 'Perfect' on the women.
Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, hunt yesss, BEST DRESSED EVER‼🥰🥰🥰
Crown Princess of Denmark in that Purple, LAWD YESSSSS‼I love it❣
Please show the stunning outfit worn by Brigitte Macron!   I thought she knocked it out of the park!
Fumi is looking fabulous as always
Thoroughly  enjoyed  your crisque you've got an eye for modifications.
😊I would love to know what is in the  delivery 🎉
Love your tiara
My little  sister wore a tiara to clean her house when she was first married.
You look like a queen in your crown
Shame Meghan didn't come. Shed have shown them how it's done. But true, Maxima was best dressed. Charlene and Katy Perry frumpy.
Fumi, the shimmer suits you well. Do I see blue eyes?
You did such a wonderful job reviewing these fashions, took me back to Joan Rivers, it was just as enjoyable, you were exactly on target, on every single one! Thank you.
Thank you for giving a detailed unbiased reading on the outfits worn by different cultures. Unlike other videos detailing the dresses, they were downright mean and bias especially to the American women.
Oh dear, the heavy set young women, she just overwhelmed her self, who would have let her out of house with that monstrosity on, it looks like something Fergie or her daughters would have worn, just couldn't have been worse. And Zara is elegant, so beautiful and you are right, she made a rare excellent choice, for her figure and coloring. I love her, but like you say, she's busy elsewhere, she doesn't have time she needs a stylist she looks 20 lbs lighter and a decade you get in this than Easter outfit, I was certain she was pregnant again, she looked so  frumpy!
Maxima was exquisite!
I think they should have all worn a version of your dress! You are beautiful and so well spoken and elegant.
Loved the niece of queens, Spanish look, just gorgeous!
Beatrice is doing so much better, she's learning about style and breaking out of her mom's terrible taste bubble.
You are such a classy lady.  You need a crown.
I so agree about Middleton, make up too heavy, shoulders & hat, just like you said, just not good, didn't work.
Truly enjoyed,  thank you ✌️
Pippa, is glamours!
The royale families of Europe are all related; they inter-married to preserve royal blood in earlier centuries. It makes sense they would come to support the English coronation.
Well,   I will say this one good thing about the Royal guest’s …………. They was dressed to impress and with no boobage ❣️🙏🏾💙💎🪡🧵  I love the classic way the women dress …….  Hands down the best part of the con- a- nation🗣️
The British Prime Minister's wife, just awful, a maxi, the heels, it couldn't have been worse.  And out of everything she could have worn, why oh why? Very odd, very very odd.
Trudy, no jewelry, very uninspiring.
Queen Mathilde of Belgium was fabulously attired from head to toe. The colour scheme of blush pink perfectly structured dress that flowed over her form with baby pink heels and white hat and pearl choker was stunning in its understated elegance.
The Greek powder blue women is the only one that looked at Harry when he walked by, the rest shunned him, purposeful averting eyes & head, perfect form. But she looked at H, right in the eyes and with such a look of disdain, it made me gasp. A very courageous woman. I thank her for that reaction to the terrorist.
My opinion Eugenie and Beatrice I'm always watching what unusual headpiece or hat they wear Princess Charlene tall attractive but hit and miss with fashion PC rarely smiles P Catherine and P Mary of Denmark always impeccable
Mary always looks very tasteful and elegant.
You are a beautiful lady and your cown was perfectly made for you. You look very Royal. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@fumidesaluvold loved,loved,loved your commentary. Thank you!
Biden no jewelery, looked naked, but the blue was pretty and thank goodness it was fitted.
I love you and your channel, what fun, the Princess Catherine head piece was beautiful as you described it, I was finally able to see it's beauty.
I disagree, Princess Charlene of Monaco looks beautiful. She is overall simple and elegant. She wore what royal women have classically worn to coronations and traditional events.
Great job hosting Fumi!!! I enjoyed.
Your Beautiful lady indeed...your Crown looks good in You❤🎉
And OMG!!! The QUEEN OF BHUTAN was absolutely exquisite!!! She, in my opinion, was the most beautiful among the attendees...🫶🫶❤️❤️🥰🥰
Fumi i really love your crown i live for it lol
The Queen of Belgium needed a better bra or better tailoring at the busy line
I think Jill Biden needed a brooch or pearl choker.  Her dress was beautiful but it needed some sparkle.
For me... the BEST DRESSED were Prime Minister  RISHI SUNAK and his gorgeous wife Ms. MUTTY.
Love that you are kind to everyone and found something nice to say to all.
What a GREAT FASHION REVIEW this was!!! You just gained a new subscriber...❤❤❤
i love that blouse
Biden's together channeling Ukraine...subtle...hmm
I love royal fashion.  They are fashionable and classy at all times. It's the way all women should dress, in my opinion.  But Lady Armstrong Jones dress looks like it got stuck in a shredder.
This was a beautiful review. You were kind even to the ones you didn't think were a hit. I enjoyed the review very much. Thank you
The headpiece Princess Kate wore at King Charles III's coronation was neither a crown nor a tiara. It just an elaborate 'head topper'.
Fumi, you are Our Regal Queen 👑
Is it me, or is Kate always looking like sad 😔
Charlene of Monaco disappointed me. Usually she is a vision...at the Coronation...a mess. She looked frumpy & dumpy. It aged her 40 years. Pippa & Beatrice pleasantly surprised me. Especially Beatrice, she was  amazin. But, my favorite was the Woman who carried the 🗡️Sword. Ahhh. Perfection!
I just stumbled upon this channel and I have to say I love you and your energy. You are absolutely beautiful, I look forward to seeing more videos. God bless you for bringing  joy and smiles to so many.
The Queen of Lesotho was divine. That gorgeous green and blue dress with the wonderful swishy skirt ❤️
It's a shame that he married Camilla!!!!!!! LMFAO
Edward Ennifield should know that chewing gum in public is not a good look. Your style of commentary is acute and very complimentary to most people. I've always despaired over Beatrice and Eugenie's lack of colour sense and that fuschia or berry hued frock on Beatrice was a mistake imo.
Correction Fumi…lol….I can see it’s going to take you a minute to get used to the term ‘his’ royal magesty for HRM and not ‘her’ and King not Prince Charles…lol.
There are many branches of royal families.  Many of them are descendant of a common ancestor which accounts for the “royal” blood.
Queen Rania was beautiful like always.
I’ve never seen this channel before and I have to say, Fumi, that you are absolutely delightful!   I agreed with all of your assessments
Fumi I can listen to you so all day. You’re such a bright spirit. I loved your commentary on the gowns. You were spot on. ❤
Camilla needs a lift up bra!
The crown is beautiful and suits you so well.
I appreciate all the information about the royals.  Thank goodness for youtube that I can watch and listen to your honest  analysis on fashion and humor.  Enjoyed you very much!
❤❤❤❤❤
I disagree that First Lady Biden’s outfit was fantastic. It was ok in my opinion. I agree with all your other takes .
Love your crown. You look fabulous. Wonderful commentary.
You did a good review of the clothes the guests wore.
Wow!  You look like a royal boss yourself!
Don’t the big hats obscure the view of those behind them? Seems unfortunate.
Loved the crown on you!  Fabulous look!  Princess Kate never misses!
I really enjoyed the fashion of it. Thank you for a wonderful job.
What hypocrisy, Harry and Megan, can't be forgiven, but a home wrecker can be queen.🤥.  There is hope out there.
The Monaco queen or princess she does not want to be with him, that's been in all the media.  She also had a medical condition that may have changed her appearance.   She looks like a totally different person from when she first got with him.
We live We love your Highness look Fumi❤
Harry wife went hiking according to news with pics
you forgot the princess of Morocco the sister of the king she was well dressed in moroccan traditional clothes dated to the heritage of morocco the second oldest royal country after japan.dont know did u see the lady of lesoto and couldnt see the moroccan princess
Fumi you are just being kind !!!  You look amazing! love to your family God Bless!!
Samantha Cameron looked plain as usual. She never looks special.
👸🏾👑
Catherine, Princess of Wales, was wearing  an elegant bandeau not a crown. Meghan & Harry are separated. She spent the day in the company of Marcus, her man, while pretending to be hiking. Stop it! There was no birthday party!!
I've never heard of you before but you captured my attention.  You're so full of life! You are so classy! I hope King Charles gives you one of Queen Elizabeth's crowns 😊. You have this positive attitude and you are fair in your judgment regardless of the position that these women hold. It's a classy breath of fresh air to view your video ( considering that I hate social media). Keep up the good work my dear ❤.
That was awesome .Thank you
You look beautiful ❤
Nice video, thanks for your thoughts
YEEES! I used to watch Ab Fab Toooooo!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Classic!!!! You look AMAZING! LOVE your crown 👌👌
lol... Love  you Fumi , you sound like Joan Rivers here. =)
hello fumi, can you please do an video  comment on queen camilla as being king charles mistress while he was married to Diana. thank you sooooo much.
Fumi thanks  for the review they all look good but I think the Royals should come and borrow good Tailor from  Nigeria 💕we have good fashion designers here that design gorgeous royal dresses 🥰
I dont blame Harry for leaving right after the coronation. He had people at home waiting for him who Really care about him  His wife and children are more important than some stuffy people who have made it  quite clear that they don't want anything to do with him . He made an appearance, as he should, and then it was time to  get home to his REAL family. He should have been allowed to wear his uniform. He fought    and earned it. So much hypocrisy in the monarchy!🎉
Well done Fums!!!!
Great commentary.  Agree Princess Charlene did look dowdy.  Didn’t like her outfit at all.  My first time on your channel.  You are fabulous! 🥰
Gorgeous darling..!   👑 YESSS.!
Princess Charlene's dress was nice, maybe needed a different color;
Dear Fumi…let’s love ❤️ fashion together, forever! Great minds do think alike.
I highly disagree with you on Katie Perry, She was a wreck.
What about Thailand 🇹🇭 😢
Being the granddaughter of the Late Princess Margaret, who was a fashion icon in her own time, Lady Margarita Armstrong-Jones’s sense of fashion isn’t very impressive. I agree, her whole look was a bit much 😅
Very.nice.lady.Ms.Desalu-Vold
What about princess Mariam of Morocco she was wearing beautiful traditional Moroccan dress.
You forgot quite few, you should have done all of them not just some.
So why did the crown and British accept Camilla, as queen, when they gave Wallace Simpson and Megan hell. The biggest Hippocritic, that's why America fought for it's independence and they don't accept the strong willed ladies who wasn't born with a silver spoon, won the heart of the men who loved them 😍.
First time watching and I thoroughly enjoyed you! 😉👏
Grreat video. You are spirited, fun, elegant, and entertaining. Thanks!
Hi I'm Karleen from Trinidad. Izm in lov wit yr videos. They are all educational. Can u do a segment on eating with knife n fork. I really love hw you educate women.
I wish it was more customary to wear hats in the USA. I love hats
I favored our Philippine President and his wife wearing our native customized Barong Tagalog made from pineapple fibers. They looked unique and fabulous too.
I personally thought Katie Perry's outfit was poorly fitted & looked a little dumpy because of that. Jill Biden & her granddaughter were impeccably dressed & represented us very well. I agree that the Princess of Monaco was not in a flattering suit. I have noticed some of the women had dresses that did not give them a flattering bust line, they looked like they had inner tubes around their chests, not flattering for any woman.
Enjoyed this!
I just thank goodness Harry's wife didn't appear!!!
I agree with you Fumi Queen Maxima was the best dressed....I live for that dress
The European royals are all related. In the past Royals only married Royals
Isn’t it customary to wear a hat & gloves?
King of Lesotho 🇱🇸 that is my king 🤴 ❤😊😊
The princess in pink & her husband was the best couple.
Jill Biden represented she looked absolutely beautiful I loved that cornflower blue outfit, simply wonderful
Jill Biden was suppose to have on a hat. The bow was not appropriate.
So do they not let the male royals have their heads, because the balding ages them, and looks a mess. My husband had the same problem (jewish), he just shaves his, and keeps his beard tappered and it looks so much better.
This was so good!!!!
I think Katy Perrys dress was way to tight and did not fit her well.  Yuck!
Rama, looks 20 years old.
Charlene, used to look stunning . But has gone downhill in recent years.
You look fabulous like you were part of the king Charles  ceremony
13:40  Olive oil
Duabaserwaa. Is a GHANAIAN designer . And in our local dialect the name DUABA means Tree child or Child of a Tree. Its a local GHANAIAN dialect
If Diana was still with us she would along with Kate out dressed,out looked all of them,which they all hated when she was here with us.
If it was up to me I would wear a tiara every day!but
Fumi you look lovely
You look very beautiful!
I love Sara and her rugby husband ,Zary took after her mum ,she also competed in horse racing( a competitive jockey like her mum. )
Penny is BEST DRESSED!  Head to Toe Front to Back. She was perfect impeccable and Royal specific!
Don't underestimate the mistress (jump off) because now She's the QUEEN!!!
Fumi I live for your look today. 😊
Ms Fumi you always look gorgeous! I love your crown! I was up at 5am watching the coronation. It was so beautiful and so interesting. I enjoyed the celebration concert as well. The royals have always been so interesting to me.
I feel sorry for Harry .
Wonderful wife? Camilla is one of those side chicks that really made a come up ,I think the monarchy should be abolished,and yes me and siblings were born there but we left after school.I love that you in full character ,crown & all 😁
That Crown Is Beautiful Yours And Kate
Eva is the vibe!
😁👍 hello Queen Fumi!👑👑
I love you Fumi❤️
Quee fumiiiii Yeay for for Maxima for the best dress  👗
Side chick aka Camilla 🤮will never be a queen! Always side chick !! 🚮 ….. Queen Diana for life❤❤❤
Sorry, Fumi. Camilla is not my queen nor will she ever be.
Queen Lesotho yesss.
Lovely review Fumi. On point.
Aunty, I'm saddened that you seem to cosign the monarchy. The OG colonizers.   They are wack AF and thieves.   Built their wealth off the back of people who look like me.   And the UK's foot is still on their former colonies necks.   🤦🏾‍♀️  And for all of you who are about to come for me because of this comment....I don't care. I said what I said.   I still love Aunty F.   And no, I only watched 1 munute of this video.
Thanks for keeping it positive!
Over 200 million in tax payers money was spent on this farce while most of us are struggling to keep the lights on and what did the king say while sat in his golden carriage with his horse faced queen? "This is boring"!! The ungrateful sod. How many times through the coronation did he say "I'm not here to be served, I'm here to serve"? At least 6 times and guess what? He's never served anyone anything in his 74 privileged years. On the contrary.. he's been served from the day he was born. We pay for his first class private healthcare while we can't get a doctor's appointment for love nor money. We've paid for his children and grandchildren first class private education while are kids leave their education thousands of pounds in debt. We pay for their multiple holidays abroad while we struggle to afford a trip to the seaside etc.. why? Because he cuts a few ribbons a year? And before anyone says "they bring in more then they cost".. prove it! Because that claim has NEVER been substantiated. It's about time we abolished the monarchy and freed ourselves from this greedy peado protecting racist institution once and for all.
Thank you Fumi for showing us this fabulous fashion show of all these fabulous fashions from the coronation.  I so enjoyed your narration and your critique of all the different styles and you looked wonderful with your face aglow in your metallic dress and crown.   Thank you!  That was fire! 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fumi..you look so regal yourself and when you wear mesh it is always flattering on you. Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was my favorite and shout out to the men. There is something about a man in uniform! *chef’s kiss*
Side chicks all around the world take heart. You too can be queen one day.
Love your crown Fumi.
Aunty Funms, you are giving all kinds of life, your fashion sense is die for 😊. Fashion consultancy for free. I live and love ❤
I will never called Camille a Queen she's a witch
Prince Harry killed it with his nice suit and swagger!❤ he looked handsome.
Black Princess, you look gorgeous in your tiara.
Girl you look like you could be there with guests that's how pretty you are. 😊
Fantastic show and review, my sister!  Quite surprised that you did not review the King of Ashanti and his wife, i.e. since you are of Nigerian origin, your 'cousins' in Ghana? Is it because they did not wear Western outfits or  nothing to compare?😆😆
Prince Harry for me🥳
Born a 👑FUMI😂
Shame, Camilla must have the worst posture, and, she shuffles not walk. I  guess they must enjoy their romance but heck she's pathetic and will never suit royalty 😣😲
What's new fumi,and that 👑weight heavily on her soul.🥶
My first time watching your channel, really enjoy it.
And she wore Gold 👸👑❤❤. The crown looks absolutely fabulous Mama Fumi ❤
You also look beautyful❤❤🎉
UMM WHERE IS THE WALKING SISTA AT THE BEGINNINGS 😮.....I NEED HER IN MY LIFE❣❣❣💯
Queen Fumi 💯 I love your makeup and royal ensemble. ❤❤❤
Love the imagination ❤❤😊😊
So the british media had the nerve to criticize Princes Harry's Dior coat calling it unbritish whiles Princess Eugenie wore Fendi.The nerve.Queen Letizia never disappoints.I have followed her for years and I say she is one of the best dressed royal woman with Meghan,Queen Rania and Princess Mary.
Come tru Fumi ❤❤
Should be Queen Diana not home recker
Fumi you look absolutely beautiful and regal! You are a Queen 👸🏿.Loved your fashion analysis 👏🏿 👏🏿
From The Netherlands,our queen Maxima is representing!we love her❤🎉
OUR VERY OWN STYLISH YET ELEGANT QUEEN MAXIMA, GREETING FROM THE NETHERLANDS 🇳🇱!
Anti Fumi.... please do a video on Tiwa Savage performance please
Lovely make up
The thought of Camilla the side chick being Queen🤮
You are Beautiful Fumi!
I love when you do the fashion reviews
It was very pleasant to see the attire they’re so CLASSY ❤️❤️❤️
The king and queen look happy. They dress nicely for their age.
FABULOUS ❤🎉
Am I the only person who had no idea how many countries had royal families!???😮
You’re Beautiful Queen Fumi ❤
The Queen of Lesotho, that dress is ill-fitting 😢
Congratulations to 630k Fumi
Fumi you look fabulous ❤
Forgive me i not know why i thought you are that markle woman friend
Indeed princess Catherine she  beautiful gorgeous gorgeous
Thanks!
I will say this about British and European fashion it’s never Doughty and it always turns your head for a second look…Americans take note 📝 😉👀
Awwwwwh mum you look beautiful Madam Fumi, am celebrating King Charles III Coronation 💓💓💓🙏🙏😇🙌🙌🔥🔥👏👏👏
You hit it out the park queen maxima was the best dressed for me also I would definitely wear that beautiful dress and accessories she understood the assignment
Hmmmm as my mother always said.... If you don't have something nice to say, just don't say anything!  Joor, let me just concentrate on the fashion ! 😑😑  *sipping wine* 🙄🙄🙄🙄....(yes wine), tea can't handle my innermost thoughts. R.I.POWER Lady D 🕊🕊
Fumi, you look Beautiful!😊❤❤❤
Two partners in crime being crowned (Charles&kamila) as if ligitimising sin&evil publicly. May the soul of Princess Diana rest in the peace of God almighty amen. God bless princess Anne and God bless William&Kate. Prayers for William&kate from Southern Cameron Africa. Amen.
Fumi I think you were being very respectful but I have never even seen so many rich people look so cheap I’m for the conservative look also tired of the T&A also but they looked horrible nothing looked tailored or ironed 😀
Not a fan of this family anymore, until Meghan and Harry’s kids are given  rights treatment, i can’t glorify an instituion of racist clowns  that does not love their black daughter in law but still want to exploit african countries in the commonweath
Did any African Kings and Queens show up & show out?
Princess Charlene of Monaco have missing the mark for the past 3 years. Absolutely sh%t hairstyle and grey and cream is not doing her any good since her weight increase. Perhaps her health is stil not better
Fumi-so gracious.
Sister Fumi, Is she still considered Queen consort or she actually the QUEEN🤔
I love the princesses wearing their traditional dresses..geogeours
The Queen of Lesotho was wearing a dress by South African designer David Tlale. Had lunch with her yesterday and she told me the dress was literally made at the last minute. To me she was the best dressed and am obviously bias because she’s family🤗😝.
You look royalty my little sister ❤
The only fashion police I watch.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You forgot to mention Lady Louise💙💙 She was beautifully dressed 🥰
Fumi, thank you for this Best and Worst Dressed at the Coronation. What do you think of the Netflix Series  Queen Charlotte, a Bridgeton Story about Queen Charlotte?
Auntie Fumi!, you were that crown like the Queen you are 👸🏾♥I'm surprised you didn't detail Catherine's outfit a bit more as it also was an hommage to British design - Alexander McQueen dress and the crown from Jess Collett & Alexander McQueen. I loved how both her and Charlotte's crown looked like solid silver with diamonds/gold, when they were actually skilfully embroidered. Amazing craftsmanship. I live for it!! 😍
Queen Fumi, you  look regal and beautiful😍 The royals aren’t my cups of tea,  I am here for the FASHION😁❤️‍🔥
This will sound mean but I don't like Charles and Camilla at all. I watched a bit of the coronation and the thing I can say is I want a cape and I'll leave it at that.
Looking BEAUTIFUL as ever❤❤ Fumi
Just wished Edward was not chewing gum -  it spoilt the look and let him down badly
Nairobi blue yeeeeees,watching from Nairobi
Sorry sis-they r colonizers, but u r  beautiful wearing your crown. We should all wear the crown of Jesus.  We r all a part of the Royal priesthood. If we know that we’re sinners and  r saved by grace and know that Jesus Christ died for us.
Meagan would had shown them all "what she was working with!!"
Thanks for Sharing ❤️🥰
Bold of you to assume that Kate will be Queen, lol
Love the crown 👏👏👏👏
I’ve seen better outfits at the average Desi or Nigerian wedding. EMBARRASSING!
Love the fit, gold everything. ❤❤Fumi your top looks like the Tom Ford that Erica Girardi wore in Real housewives of Beverly Hills S7, the same one that Lisa Vanderpump wore(the dress) for the reunion. Who would tell if it’s designers or not?😄
Fumi, did i hear correctly? Did i hear you refer to the mistress who was the 3rd person in diana's marriage, 'wonderful' wife? 😢😂😂😂, i think youre trying to be neutral but, how far are you willing to go?
Eugenie is Andrew’s daughter, not Edward’s.
Eugenie is prince Andrews daughter. Prince Andrew is the one who was best friends with convicted Peado Epstein and he paid off his accusers to save his position.
Lovely review as usual Funmi. Been looking out for it and rushed here immediately I got the notification. You look lovely. Meanwhile  Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice are  Prince Andrew's daughters not Edward's.
Eugenie  is the daughter of prince Andrew  and not prince Edward.
No its prince Andrew daughter
I vote that Auntie Fumi can wear a crown WHENEVER Her Highness desires... 😊👑
Love love  Looking gorgeous as usual 😊
Here for it! Thank you Aunt Fumi 😍
Love the king
It should have been Princess Diana getting that crown…Ofc Camilla was the worst dressed😂
See the way I ran here 😌🤗
Harry looked dashing.. very nice 😉 but it is shameful that he was given no role unlike his dirty uncle.
Please don't hate me but I don't give 2 craps about the king and the "queen" blah but I'm here for the fashion and Mama Fumi u always look good... I lived for the matching look of Catherine and Charlotte. I'm a silver baby. 🤣
Regalia is how you refer to their attire that was worn during the coronation.
Fumi, please can you recommend a website where I can buy those beautiful hats which you British ladies wear?Some affordable hats, please.Thank you. By the way, i will reserve my comment on how Camilla looked. I miss Princess Diana.
