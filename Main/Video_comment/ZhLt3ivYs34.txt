50 Shades of Arteta is CRAZY!!
3:32
A year later and the score is still the same haahahha
joy to my ears
Like them wait right there
"The only thing he can manage is a till cause it's on the counter" - Expressions. 😂 Such a clever line
imagine being a Spurs fan
I genuinely believe that you’re the reason that Spurs are relevant
I don't even like football honestly i find it so boring but i do watch all of expressions stuff. not a clue what hes saying but its entertaining
2:17 😂😂
Arsenal fan here, this guys a legend too funny 😂 13yearrsssss without a trophy, that’s so embarrassing even Wigan athletic won the FA cup in 2014 I think 😂😂
Cry
Fam fam fam calm down
All man press is GYALLLL😭😭
The first and third goal were lucky goals,  but the second one was a 2003/4 arsenal goal 😉
Brilliant 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Not winning trophies in EPL for 13 years 🤣 that's okeyh but in another tournament yes. But spurs? All trophies in his dream only 🤣🤣🤣
“Bagel FC fam” 😂😂😂
i dont understand half the things he says, but he looks angry and thats hilarious
HAHAHAHA you deserve that , now cry with your mama . Cry 😂 baby . Spurs is 💩
After loosing to United…. Yeah it gets worse 💀
nuno the dad of lucas moura 🤣
"We're toxic fam, might as well have Britney Spears as chairman fam" omg I'm an Arsenal fan but these puns are next level
Halfa nowaa! Halfa NOWAA!
AEW !!!
This guys fucking analogies come directly off the dome no script!!
My g talking wolves, u in wolves colours lol. Love u ex from a gooner
As an Arsenal fan, I wish AFTV were this funny and likeable.
Man you funny but why you supporting Spurs though 😂😂😂
From Kenya, I am an arsenal fan but this guy is a legend, that accent is a thing👌👌
I think Expressions have more premier League and Arsenal fans than Tatty-nham fans
Morgan Freeman fc looool!Am an Arsenal fan but feel you mate!
I just sub to a Tottenham channel,oh well Come on YouGunners 😂😂
"man need to hire some school teachers blud because these defenders don't know how to mark" 😭😭 this man is a genius
Premier League pack of Polo's is an amazing line lol.
This is why you should support the other north London team
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can we have a fam count 😂
As a arsenal fan the only 2 things I like about spurs is son and expressions haha
Tottenham get battered everywhere they goooooooooooooooooooooooo !! Looool🤣🤣🤣
Michael Jackson FC 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "They don't really care about us" 😁😁😁
Gooner here I come for the meltdown & barz.
Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal
This is good for my soul! 🤣🤣🤣
Sometimes i wonder if he just makes fun of spurs instead of being angry😂😂
The thing with Expressions is - he is either genuinely sad or happy for the club. Never abusive. Never raging like a maniac.  And a genius with words. Most talented of them all.
Michael Jackson FC. They don’t care about us. 😆
Ngl, if you didn't lose those players, you wouldn't have lost
Epic rants Emmy awards
Give us Kane and maybe we'll give you Lacazette in return this January 🤪🤪
You should've sold Kane when you had the chance for around 150 mil and built a team around Son. I'm sorry to say, but it looks impossible for Spurs now to land inside the top 6. ( Arsenal fan )
Michael Jackson FC!!
Arsenal fan here: You're jokes.
Harry Kane’s career is over… he will get 25 goals max this season then he will go for about 50 mil next year as a medicoa striker
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha😂
I love when Spurs are struggling coz the bits from this fellar is hilarious
Dude is hilarious! 😂😂🤣. But he speaks facts though!!
😂😂😂😂next level funny
if your team is getting tonked, as away fans you sing harder. You NEVER abandon your team. that is the most shocking and unforgiveable aspect of Spurs.
😂
I don't understand a single word he's saying but I'm guessing he's not happy with spurs???
Banter club
"It's like Tupac never even made the song, no 'Changes' fam" - absolute quality! I was almost crying at this point! 😂
NO WAY YOU ARE ANGRY AT SPURS  YOU JUST WON THE PL CHAMPIONS IN AUGUST TROPHY YOU UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE
Who are spuds gonna get if they sack ninth choice nuno? 🤣🤣🟥
💯 right on the money fam.  Nunoclue 🤦🏾‍♂️
50 shades of Arteta 😂
The only intro I never skip
When arsenal is winning so we don't get any AFTV content, we can always rely on Spurs and Expressions to bring the gold😅
Nuno out 😁
"50 shades of Arteta" 13:10 it was worth the wait!
I'm not a Tottenham fan but Tottenham killing mi #No🧢 😫🤣😅🤷🏾‍♂️🚑
Can you imagine Expression as a rapper, it will be Expression can't run out of bars.
Bro we know your like ya boy kane a lowkey gooner just do whats right and convert to arslam become a true  goonslim coyg 🤣🤣🤣
This guy sounds like his in year 8
Can he sack himself then the replacement chairman sacks nuno the over qualified pe teacher
who is this guy? he shud think bout doing standup comedy if he hasnt done already..seriously he is funny...got the gift of the gab
Dele Ali and Ndombele were spectating in a North London Derby no work rate off the ball , but overall no urgency overall our players thought that it was a training session
they are Nigerians because they did not perform well, the moment they play good you call them england players
NUNO DEM WAY THERE 💯🌟
Pity nuno… he got no support from levy.. kane too suddenly play mediocre maybe dont have heart and soul for spurs
Memorial bench....... No changes by 2pac 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude you need to do fan interviews to compete with aftv.
11:20 😂😂😂😂 I'm dying
I can see bicep vein now
Remember wen Arsenal was complaining about the same thing
Everyone viewer on here is a arsenal fan 😂😂😂😂😂 I love ex vids after a NLD
This guy needs his own TV program no cap
Them way there
tbf from an Arsenal fan perspective, it could have been a 50:50 game if Gil and Skipp starts
We wanted Emerson but he rejected us for you so we ended up with TT - 💀
I'm an Arsenal fan and was at the game. Arsenal settled for what they had in the second half and never really tried to score any more goals.  It was Arsenals day but I'm sure spurs will improve and be better at WHL in the return fixture. Kane was shocking! But were Arsenal very good or spurs very bad? Arsenal also have big problems which are still there despite this win. Coyg
That angry he’s trying to be fun ! 👀
50 shades of Arteta 😭😭
nuno needs time. you man need to have a drink
Love u mann!!! Son n Moura only playing the rest just dancing around pretenders!
Arsenal Fan here bro, big up yah self X keep up the good rants😂🤣🤣I’ve given you a like for this video!
ANNUAL LEVY 😂
So what actually motivates spurs fans 🤔🤔
This guy is chatting shit. Tottenham has played brilliant against Arsenal. They tried their hardest 🤧 there no shame in bringing second to the great gunners
You haven’t seen Everton’s bench then lol 😂
Where are you g?
London is red ……Harry needs a Cane  Started at the top and now ya fellas below ⬇️
Exs is too much joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man said Michael Jackson F.c ya know... Haha EX is a mad lad..
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Why leave only 30 minutes in. I get your team is playing bad. But you might as well watch them it's still your team.
Spurs and the english language getting murdered.
Embarrassing. Up The Arsenal🔴⚪️
"Michael Jackson FC" 😭🤣🤣

Arsenal fan here, gotta say this man is a legend for real  😂😂😂 man said “50 shades of Arteta”
Can someone please put in a welfare check?
I am here for this content
Tbh Spurs we the better side in the 2nd half.. That ramsdale save was class.. He was legit in the air for 2 to 3 seconds
You got peppered differently and I love every fucking minute. Fully deserved for thinking you’re one of The big boys! Hope you guys got humbled by the bomboclaat beating! Fucking love it
I believe it’s always a mistake to keep star player when he wants out. Should’ve accepted £100m for Kane and reinvested. Kane has mentally left
“Man was in a time machine” 😳🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Nuno is just trash version of Jose...the longer he stays..spurs will fall into relegation....
Croydon astronaut☠️☠️☠️😂
This guy is a nonstop metaphor machine
Oh shit he got bars for days.
Am an arsenal fan,  Bt i love his honesty...
"may as well have Britney Spears as chairman cus we is toxic blud" haha 🤣
Kane never scores in the first month of the season tho..
Ive got 7 spare traffic cones we can use for the next game. Might get a better result. Or just play the players that have some passion; Son, Skipp, Moura, Gill, Tanganga, Romero, Lorris and some from the women's team.
Expressions am an arsenal fan and I fucks with you heavy lol 😂  Legend !
Even as an Gooner, I have now subscribed to your content. You're an OG

As na Arsenal fan, I feel sorry for the Spurs fans. They have such a dead club from ethernity with 0 chance to win anything in the recent decade. Big up Xpressions for being so passioned about his club
We decide to play on the counter and get done twice on the counter. It's peak.
Puns are next lvl brilliant
Bigger prick than troops found here, copycat of a rival is pretty pathetic
To be honest we need pochettinio back
The only worthy person relating to Spurs is Expression. 😂
Arsenal fan in California, mad respect Ex
Man said “ it felt like I was in a  machine”
So...I'm not sure why this channel is called Expressions Oozing...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤.
Great assist from Kane to Saka

100% the most naturally funny football YouTuber. That Deep-cut Arthur Fowler reference had me rolling.
That beautiful stadium No Trophies to show yet. Ooozing man.
You are the only good in that club
Big up ex but north London will always be red.
How he think of all these jokes of the cuff 😂😂
Kane actually a genius
It's peak 😂😂
Until Tottenham's current situation, all the faults lie with owner Joe Lewis and chairman Daniel Levy. This is so clear that there is no room for controversy. However, it is just surprising that none of Tottenham's fans criticize them. They just blame the coach and the players. The coach has no choice but to form a team of players bought by the owner and chairman. The players are also composed of players recruited by the owner and chairman. That's why Tottenham is in the current crisis because the owner and chairman are not interested in soccer but are just interested in making money. As long as Joe Lewis is the owner and Daniel Levy is the chairman, Tottenham has no hope.
Bench like Arthur Fowler’s , brilliant
Titanic FC 😂😂😂
I really really don't understand What happened
mans is a discount troopz blud ting, yhear fam?
From an Arsenal fan, this guy is too funny 🤣🤣🤣
It's my favourite channel, and I'm an arsenal fan 😂
We should have got rid of those two donkeys at the back over the summer.. We didn’t !To many defensive midfielders that sit to deep and invite pressure winks, Skipp, hojberg Ndombele. We leave to many gaps in the centre of the park. No creativity in midfield since we got rid of Eriksen. Our forwards are all in a bunch in the middle of the pitch inviting teams to use the width. Alli needs to be sold in January. Romero needs to play every game. Royal looks a descent player who provides width and attacks. Regillion and lo Celso need to step up. Nuno must be blind. He didn’t Change the formation in the first half the forwards were all within 3 meters of each other pushing a high line in the middle of the pitch. Arsenal were battering us using the width. What a joke our club is becoming !
As an arsenal fan. Real talk poch was a great manager. Dunno why you let him go. I mean arsenal are run poorly but the running of spurs is an actual joke
Hang on a minute! You won the league last month & now you're on Nuno's back! So fickle! 🤣
nuno the dad of lucas moura and nathan redmond had me laughing
Arsenal are poor, Its hard to be poorer but we found away.
What do you think of Tottenham ex
Man said backdoor like lil durk 😂😂
After watching Robbie and Troopz player ratings and watching expressions you just completed my weekned and started my week ,by the way the Colour of North London is is is  REEEEED. Thank you🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😁😁
Croydon astronaut HAHAHAHAHAH
I binge listened to your clips today for about 7 hours at work and you made an otherwise cack Monday fly by like a Smith Rowe love tap into the net.  Hilarious stuff. Very cool guy.  Thank you dude. You’re lots of fun;-)
You're always complaining about the  managers. Talk about your English players.
😂😂😂 bagel fc
The Saka Water wordplay was cold, this guys flow is undeafeated
this should be on netflix. this guy is funny
He needs his own show 🤣🤣🤣
Busta Rhymes FC they make it clap everytime they come visit 😅
Tottenham should sell Kane and try to get benzema or martial
ahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhaahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahaahhahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhhahahahahhaha
lol made my day
The truth hurts one up let's see how our seasons go now.
Lol, when he said "It hurts, it hurts", I felt that 🤣
Different coaches same story, what's the constant variable here? Not the coach. Firing Mourinho the was Tottenham has, before a final and without any proper replacement planned just to please the fans that were screaming "Mourinho out".  Great job.
Gooners 💪🏻London is red 😂
Why did we pay 10mill more for Emerson than Tomyasu, sounded all summer he was coming
Are you happy to be Arsenal's clown? 🤣🤣
"Man need to hire some school teachers because these defenders don't know how to mark"  😂🙌🏾
this guy is too funny
Partey and Xhaka bossed the midfield, Spurs didn't want to see them, Odegaard gave you lot no time on the ball, and when you pressed the press was broken. 2nd half was more balanced after the subs but it was too late, Kane was shocking.
Hahahahahahahaha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0hj8PvwKNk&ab_channel=TheCalmMeditativeMind
13 years fam... may as well be in cell 😂😂
I living in Sweden and Sweden is red bro what you talking about north London Chips 😂😂
Just here to boost your account king 😁😁😁
Expressions should be writing Hollywood comedy scripts. Genius.
https://youtu.be/d0Ea8OnBheg
Skipp needs to start over dele for now on
Spuds need to get mr Ko Kane in their team geez.
"Man needs to hire some school teachers blud, cos these defenders do not know how to mark" 😁😁😁😁
You man running your mouth when you were top of the league for a week 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what you saying now? You got bullied and embarrassed yesterday Kane getting the assist for Saka was the icing on the cake 👌
Expressions needs to convert to arsenal. He's born to be an arsenal just hasn't found the right path yet.
chris tucker's younger brother.
Man said it's arranged marriage🤣
Bro we need a good  midfielder
50 shades of arteta... Jajaja🤣
I'm a Gunner. But nomatter how much you get ass whooped don't close the channel my guy. We love Expressions FC
At this rate nandos fc will hold 3 against all the London clubs😂😂😂  COYG🔴🔴🔴
YOU HAVE YOUR DNA BACK....SHOULD BE HAPPY.  PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT ONLY WANTS LIKES IN SOCIAL MEDIA ARE CREATING MICKEY MOUSE PLAYERS LIKE DELE....   BY THE MOMENT YOU SAID FOSSIL FOOTBAL INSTEAD OF FOSSIL PLAYERS YOU WERE POINTING AT THE MANAGER AND NOT THE REAL PROBLEMS OF LAST YEAR RESULTS.  MOURINHO WAS RIGHT...ALWAYS RIGHT AND I ´M VERY SAD FOR THIS.
Can’t be losing to arsenal worst team in history
"That girl was a real crowd pleaser" 😂😂😂 you absolute Legend
“Only ting man press is gyal” wicked lyrics.
This show is gangsta sh it big up coys  don't u think it time to sell dele  all he muggy he a prat he a melt he needs to join Everton at best or someone like Leyton orient or Stevenage
As an Arsenal fan , I think Son will leave if support is not there for him! He’s too good.
Oozing like my girl
Watching this man matching his team in been so silent when that 3rd goal went in. Xceptional... RIDICULOUS!!!!!! 🤣
Give Nino time,he will come good.
If you don't remember then you have been living under a rock arsenal wins against spurs hold record in England we have spanked this cunt of a team more than any team I guess that's why we call it north London derby it's been enjoyable for quite a while even their best striker was on our academy, I mean who comes out with a tshirt design with a chicken 🐔 on top of the ball I mean that's lazy could have put something else for goodness sake crying out loud 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s good to see that expression has been found because it’s an over the British media that he has been reported missing like the entire Tottenham team. 😂🤣😂. Kane is the problem for real. Since he came back in the team the team started playing worse. I’m an Arsenal fan and I’m presently loving  Kane’s performances. He’s like a dead weight. 😂🤣😂
"Michael Jackson FC - they don't really care about us." #priceless
I’m an Arsenal fan and I love watching Spurs loss but it sucks to see Ex like this ngl
Count the number of "blud" and "fam"
What does he mean by *back door fam?*
🤣 Smith-Rowe plays reminds me of Tomáš Rosický. Even down to the way he plays his socks 🧦 He should continue to play from the flanks and not the middle of the field. COYG! 😜🤪
Nunez must go. Kane too.
This video just popped up on my feed and I don't even watch football but I understood everything he said and agree. Training kits, and man only pushing girl not football!! 😂😂😂😂 But man was making valid points though.... subscribed!! 🥶🥶
What I don't understand.....why don't Nuno start Bryan Gil rather then bring him on as a late sub?  You can see clearly Spurs miss badly an Eriksen or Alderweireld type player.
Defenders are doing a mannequin challenge 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Boozing sauce... Drinking too forget boss.
I do not know dem way dere
R.I.P Arthur Fowler only old skool dons know this
Spurs top of the league is like an elephant stuck up a tree,you don't have a clue how it got up there but know it will come crushing down at some point.
Best thing about being an Arsenal fan today is Expressions one liners against Tottenham 🤣🤣🤣 genius
Expressions got the best one liners in the game
Levy is to blame never backs was a class established player always buys potential hoping to make a few extra million where in reality potential should come from our youth squads ,nuno couldn't change a ten pound note
That's how we do😂
When Mou comes to Spurs, they doesn't give him a better transfer in terms of defender and the midfielders. Hoebjerg plays great when he comes and Alli is finished and you sacked him instead of supporting them.
Sacked trophee mourinho on cup final week only to replace him with his back up goalie at porto 😂😂
You and your club are a joke 😂
What is even worse that spurs 13-years trophy drought!?      the 17-years trophy drought just before that 🤣🤣🤣  Essentially they had 1 trophy (EFL cup) between 1991 till today . . . ONE TROPHY IN 30 YEARS 🤣🤣🤣 that is T H I R T Y - Y E A R S
Britney Will only say, ooops I’ll did it again..
He ain’t oozing sauce today!! 🔴⚪️
I cant wait to see you in alternate universe blud,when you cheering for arsenal blud,you know them wey there
I’m an arsenal fan but I love this channel. All the references dude makes are fucking gold  😂😂
JM already made Kane a CAM. He can't change back
Shut up you FAKE FAN!!!!!
what language is this?
Ole have 6 months honeymoon period. Arteta the same, even won FA Cup. Tuchel, won UCL. Nuno ... 3 matches, honeymoon effect gone.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Kane the gooner, wanted to play in the Arsenal team so he turned up as our 12th man,  he was thinking dat team look exciting i wonder if i can have word with my bro Saka and join on a free when I’m 32 like Auba.
Am a gooner but Expressions is a legend. I look forward to his reviews whether Tottenham win or lose 😃🤣
We have lost our identity
Can we actually appreciate expressions' intro for a sec. It's quality.  Top Tier intro
So are London urbanites obsessed with only 2 words?
this guy is a poet
😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
I been searching look for this guy he’s the funniest 😂 I support arsenal and I come here to watch this joker 🤣😂😂
Bryanal Messi Gil was a good addition when came on
Croydon Astronaut 🤣🤣🤣
When you prefer someone over the "Special One"...
WHY DO YOU SUPPORT A DEAD LITTLE TINPOT CLUB
🤣🤣 Albert flower bench 🤣🤣...Then arrange marriage 💑 🤣🤣🤣 Kill it
We are oozing Ls hehehe
As a gooner i felt spurs werent up for it from minute one. Its the NLD and there was no bite. Looked like NES didnt g his men up. I was surprised how we steam rolled spurs in the first 20, didnt see it coming. Spurs's team is still the same team what poch left behind with a few added extras.
I'm an arsenal fan but im always in love with expression man. Best of enemies ❤️
Wolves fan here. We will always love Nuno. But he makes some real questionable player selections/tactics. Anyways good luck
Nuno finished 7th at wolves but is not good enough? Poch finished 8th at Sthampton before coming to spurs??. just saying
time you started supporting arsenal mate
😁😁😁😁
5-2 x 2 Expressions. You have been embarrased before😁
Its funny listening to this guy in a 2min interview. But this rant dropping about 20 pop song metaphors and analogies just becomes face. It seems forced andn. scripted.
Chickens got roasted.. 😂😂😂 COYG!!!!
Subscribed.. The passion.. Feel sorry for you, true fans. From a Chelsea fan
As an arsenal fan this content is the icing on the cake 🤣 yes!
You man play worse football than Man United and Man United rely on individual brilliance 😂😭, if Arsenal slap you up like that imagine what happens when you face Man United or Liverpool 😭😭😭, might as well forfeit before it begins you know
Audi Cup
If the team had half Expressions attitude and passion we'll be 20 points clear at the top 👏👏🤛😆😆
"PASS THE PAD"  LOL
Here to enjoy cockerel tears 😂
We were playing like we've all been Vaxxinated!!!
I don’t even wanna leave the house after that shit.... fummmming!!!!!
🤣🤣
50 shades of Arteta 🤣
😂 Expressions' facial expressions... he always looks like he's sitting on the loo, straining hard.
Different season
Feel your PAIN BRO 😎 😂 funny as hell ❤️ ex ..who 2 be a gooner
Just saying, the European Super League would have had Tottenham playing Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid.
The Coach and Horses X1 could beat this lot.
I said it before, firing Mourinho was the dumpest thing you ever deed as a team, that proved that as a team, you are clueless
Charlie kaneee😂😂😂
#3 ON TRENDING 🤑
WHEN U SMASH A TEAM SO BAD IN 35 MINS  The fans start leaving before half time 💯🔥🔥💪🏽🔴⚪️🔥🔥👑 NORTH LONDON IS RED AND ALWAYS WILL BE

As an Arsenal fan Expressions is Tottenham’s greatest addition
“One to the gut and one the the forehead my friend” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Might as well get teachers to defend because at least they know how to mark. LMAO!
The only thing he can manage is the till, is on the counter 😆 🤣 😂 too much jokes 🤣 😂 😆
"Levy needs to sack Nuno and then sack himself" 😂 im dead
Shout out Arthur fowler massive
Nuno only got the job cause no one else wanted it.
"bagel fc" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
3 man like Morgan, it’s peak fam
Ex is a king 👑
Sack himself fam
Amazon documentary just got lit
Annual Levy 😂
croydon astronaut hahahahaha
When your owner price you out of reality, you force a 50% discount yourself 🙈

the dad of Lucas Moura and Nathan Redmond lmaooooo
Threeman like Morgan lollllll
demwaydare
Son lucas ndombele looked the only ones up for it ahhhh
Expressions saying they brought in nuno who's won nothing with wolves, United brought in a manager who got relegated in the prem
Kane has had enough of carrying you guys, I don’t blame him
An angry Expressions is the highlight of my weekend.
How did I only find this channel now lol
Isnt this team the same one that destroyed Man City  1-0 a few weeks back with virtually the same players and manager? What has changed?
This is so funny to watch from a Arsenal fan :D :D
Unlucky Xman.  You lot have to keep nuno  like we stuck with Arteta.
Best rant ever 🤣😂👌😆
Bring back Mourinho
kane  wants    big  money   at   man city
RIP Arthur Fowler! Incredible refs
You can have 11 messis or 11 cr7 this club is cursed as its owned & run by dirty devils
😂😂😂 🤦🏾‍♂️
Man need to hire some school teachers cause these man don't know how to mark😂
Where is the attacking football we was told would be the priority. Didn't see it, players are not buying into it. Need to get rid of Kane. Can only see it getting worse. Ali is finished.
He always asks "you know dem way der" but I don't believe we do.
I don't even watch football, but I love the content
Sacking Poch was an unforgivable major mistake that has backfired galore - the premature emission of a saviour. We were in the final of the Champions League final - the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL BRO - and Levy sacked him before he had a chance to get everyone back on top again. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Nothing in the middle like a pack of polos 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your videos will always make beating Spurs that much better 🤣
Only thing Nuno can manage is a till, cause everything is on the counter😭
Just get the king-size rizzla out big man...we done out here.
I'm my the only one who is watching this for the 3rd time?
Dad of Lucas Moura and Nathan Redmond, 😭😭
Cry baby 😅😝
Expressions loozing
It's embarassing to talk about a thumping in NLD with that Intro.
Harry Kane is deliberately doing this because he is being held to ransom by Levy. He must have something really damning against Kane to force him to stay there. But in the end it will be at Levy’s expense if he doesn’t let him go. No doubt the truth will come out in 15 years time in a biography when everyone has either forgotten it or moved on
Danyo livi! Danyo Livi!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The "jeez expressions with another video" is getting angrier by the week 😂😂
Good luck getting 150m for a Striker who hasn't scored a Premier League goal this season lmao
As soon as troopz said expression I landed here 😂🤣😂
I thought you were wearing a wolves top for a split second
Croydon astronaut 🤣🤣🤣🤣
These man were ole-ing 😂😂😂
Kane assisted saka for the third goal 🤣🤣🤣
Danny Rose you lost. 3 big defenders dembele and walker
Smith Rowe is giving tanganga night mare and living rent free 🤪🤪😂😂
Nuno Tavares is the best Nuno in north London 🤣🤣🤣
North london is red
Expressions was left boozing by the Spuds. Bro fam come to the west side of London you know them way there? I'll show you the way we'd be thrilled to have you fam. We care about you fam so we are family bra Jamaican and all you got great sprinters winners Champs just like Chelsea ya know the Ethiopian Carleton Banks bro Lewis don't worry you got an Ethiopian here that's a blue too we win marathons and such bro you know them way there! Blue side of London fam 💙! London is Blue but that don't mean you gotta feel Blue that's all on you fam!! Levy don't respect you fam! 13 years bro how much longer?
How can you support Thot spuds and expect trophies???
If this was fifa you pass the pad! 🤣 facts tho!! 🤣🤣
I’m an Arsenal fan but love this guy, realest Spurss fan ever!
Youll always be shite youll always be shite Tottenham hotspur youll always be shit Expressions keep you mouth shut before the derby  Man looks like a likkle idiot now
Expressions about to change his brand to depressions ozzing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Training day, Alonso Harris
When will kane ever score again
Saka water isn't in the water isle in Tesco, It is bottom shelf with the Halal sweets LOL
Yo bruv I’ll put it out there I’m an arsenal fan and I didn’t expect to win yesterday. The way we’ve been has been shocking  Keep your head up big man
Midfield is the problem- has been for 3 seasons now. Can neither protect the back four or support the front forwards. Unless this is sorted, we will continue to free-fall to the bottom of the table. Time for Levy and his management team to get out. Levy needs to recognise he's not in the club for the team but to fill the stadium for non-football events. Poch knew the team had reached its limits and needed major surgery. No quality, no fitness,  no desire, no passion, no pride to wear the shirt.
Say what you want about Josè, that man got you to a Final Nuno will be lucky to get you to the final of the Play-Offs
As an Arsenal fan, I'm giving you a follow...  For entertainment purposes only.
Expressions waking up in the middle of that night with night terrors of Auba doing the Henry celebration 🎉 🙈😂
DEPRESSIONZZZ LOOOOOOOOZZIINNN 🤣🤣
All that chat for arsenal 😂😂😂 no chat now 💥💥💥💥💥💥
The defenders were doing the mannequin challenge😭😭😭😭
Your puns are so funny 😂🤣
Morning coffe fist day after NLD, this is price less fam. COYG
Great video again ex and a brilliant win for the arsenal
You were LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZING SAUCE
Morgan threeman
50 shades of Arteta lol
I totally agree with you, spurs were gutless, there was no passion, no heart, from Andy Sparsholtt from Edmonton North London, COYS,
The Daniel levy, annual leave and believe rhymes got me 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😆😆
You got put in a GIGANTIC SPLIF MY G remember after the City game 😂 😂😎
Tottenham will not win a trophy maybe next 50 years team just can't develop and got rid of a good up coming manger now expect to be top four nahhh good luck fighting for mid table 👍
“Croydon astronaut” 😂😂😂😂
as an Arsenal fan i really love this dude for his talent. so sad talented people can love Totshit hotpoo
Till now, I have no idea how Dier is still playing for your team.
Palace fan here mate, love your videos. Really make me giggle - we all feel it when we lose, it hurts so much more when our team lack guts on the field too. You get the passion across well. Nuno was never the right choice, this is gonna get so ugly - such a bargain basement call from Levy.
We know Pochittino also didn’t had a nice start  Let’s wait Let’s wait We win together  Lose together #COYSFOREVER
Thottenham Hotspliff moving like a scene of BLACKED fam uno dem way der blud
Man is hurting 😂
As an Arsenal fan, this man is hilarious lol! I can see why he's called Expressions haha! I wonder if he writes this shit down or just comes up with it on the spot
Feeling your pain Expressions
You was giving it the big one as well 😂😂😂, banter fc there is shit and below that is spurs 🤣🤣🤣
Happy for the team, but feels sorry for you man
Bruh u didn’t expect to win arsenal how are u expecting to win trophies
Ex was spot on about every single thing he said
Nuno said his first 45 against Chelsea was everything so now he went missing in this first 45 😂
Ex you should support Chelsea no man should Have to go through this kind of pain 🤗😬
Arsenal will be the king on London 🔴🔴
Easy like Sunday morning 🤣🤣🤣
🤷🏾‍♂️Analysis:-         🙄 Lloris- Ok but needs support...... 🙄Dier- Slow and Needs more Concentration to block&tackle......🙄 Sanchez- stop Oversliding the tackles....... 🙄Reguillon- Ok but needs to cross sooner...... 🙄Tanganga- Ok but need to show attacking side....... 🙄Hojberg- His perfect defensive midfield partner is Skipp...... 🤗Ndombele- Ok but he is a attacking Midfielder/No.10...... 😑Dele- Full stamina but No concentration and creativity/Only Good&cool in training and Only against Small teams..... 🙄Son- Ok but he stops in the penalty box and needs to Shoot sooner and he needs to try long distance shots cuz he can..... 🤔Kane- Without Kane we won, With Kane we lose against PL opponents, what is this theory, Is he still upset for summer and also he is playing in other trophy competition good. I have doubts because he can't win Premier League trophy but surely win other trophies together with leaving Tottenham next summer by not helping them reaching Top 6 (two possible targets in one season)...... Moura- Ok performance, full sympathy..... 😢
Come on you gunners! Aubama Bloodclot Yang
In Jose's time, you were more embarrassed than this please. Afterall, you were among those clueless fans that calls for Jose's sack, when he made the team looks like some powerful force, even demolishing man utd with 6 goals ,with many exciting n dominant plays
Ole Ole Ole haha  Was like training day if they'd smoked that pcp before the match haha  Nuno was what?  3rd choice?  Poch, Jose and then this guy?  If those two weren't good enough why would he be?  Mediocre  Titanic FC :)
Arsenal wins at home to spurs 29-1 😆 🤣 😂
Mark my words No teams gonna be scare of Spurs this season.
"only thing man can manage is a till" oh my days this is one of expressions best
I'm enjoying this much more than the Arsenal ones as an Arsenal fan haha.  The only thing Ali can press if fake dreads to his skull.  Or would that be glue or weave.  Anyway you get the idea haha
I think Nuno will go back to his back 5
So many followers. You deluted souls should rather follow «the boy hotspur»   Fam and blud. Get a language. Cubt
Last year Aubameyang turned up late.. this year Kane decided not to turn up at all.
EXPRESSIONS BOOOOOZINGGGGGGG ALCHOHOLLLLLLL
3:48 Story of my life on Fifa 🤣
FAM-count ; 3431
Sack Nunu and sack him self🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Troops is coming for you 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Depression looooooooozing!!!!
A fellow gooner shared this video with me and I must say, you're funny as hell 😂. Rivalry aside, good content. 👏🏾
wow when they lose you remember their Nigerian right
Expressions is too much 🤣🤣
Expressions " Loooooosin Sauce" 😂😂😆
Banter aside if you lot don’t win a trophy this season it’s gonna be bad, the whole league will come at you 😂
Couldn't believe Dele Ali started - he's all haircut - no effort
How much would you take for Kane is Jan?!!
The intro song is haarrrrddd
I'm glad Expressionz spoke about Kane. I Personally think Spurs are more dangerous with Son, Moura and Bergwijn. Speed, Pace and interchangeable. Moura played well when Kane wasn't playing. They should play 3-4-3. Lloris, Romero, Dier, Sanchez, Doherty, Hojbjerg, Skipp, Reguilon, Moura, Son, Bergwijn.
Yooooo 🔴
So what if men are Nigerian?????????
Spurs were great in 1961.
It's because of the 2 niagerians
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
After this game you and troopz need to redo combined 11 , no spur making it on that team 😂😂
You were mocking and sating bad things about arsenal.. see where you are now. What goes around, comes around bro!! Karma bitch
This makes feel  great  as an arsenal  fan,join the winning  team bro....Arsenal.
Ahahhahaahaahahahaha.
Kane giving me hazard 2015/16 vibes
No second half, you pass the pad 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tbh I didn't even notice that Alli was in the match. Only after full time did I notice he was substituted. Absolutely ghosted in the NLD.
Put in a splifff and sparked😂🤣
I love this guy 🤣
Easy like Sunday morning in America.
Michael Jackson FC 😭😭😭
Didn’t realise these rants were every week keep it up 🤭🤣
We need graham potter or Scott parker bad😫
If nuno was sacked now. Will he be the fastest manager to get a sacked in their first season?
Nuno isn't a bad manager, Spurs are just dead
Served u right. U were cocky before the international break,talking shits about other team.
Arsenal winning the League.
Sorry, but North London is still Red
0:25 only thing Nuno could manage is a till brutal
Ex…Don’t stress there may be banter throughout this whole week but come back stronger mate…Troopz,Robbie,and all of Aftv they looking for you…#YNWA❤️
Spurs sign the best the BEST defender in seria A in Romero and they start two idiots at CB .  They sign one of the most exiting young Spanish wingers/midfielders and they play Delle Ali , they finally sign a promising RB that they needed for years since trippier left and they start a CB in tanganga improvised at RB . I think this pretty much explains why they lost today
It’s PEAK!
hahaha the puns. wish he was a gooner
This guy is expressions losing rn
Bro you always say you've never been embarrassed like this or that whenever you lose to us🤣🤣🤣. Been hearing the same statement for many times now🤣🤣🤣
remember the big table were spurs sat with 3 wins in a row   i made 100 pounds when they beat man city thx son liverpool fan <3
We need to be ruthless and sack nuno im sorry but we've seen it before, managers just don't click and they go quick or they get given a chance and the season is wasted. Don't waste the season get nuno out and someone who knows how to attack seriously! You say bring back attacking football then this...abysmal really. Watching todays game as a spurs fan was totally embarrassing
You man turned up like escorts, took the pipe and dipped after 30mins 😂
Spurs are an idi0t club for not accepting 150mil for harry kane😂
3 weeks a go I saw different person bantered Arsenal...Hahahaha...🤣🤣🤣
We need Antonio conte badly
Sell Kane in January
as a neutral fans, Arsenal vs TH will always be a good youtube content, whoever that lost will be malding
As an arsenal fan, this is the screaming after a good F
50 shades of Arteta 🤣🤣
Wipe your tears.
man dont care about no trophies. returns on investments...Daniel Levy
Expressions loozing 🤣
he's right, you pass the pad. 😂😂😂
Can some one please explain me why he use the same word Blood so often, Where is Slang is used, And when we use this word... Ignore my ignorance....
Keep same energy spurs fans lol
I think it is time spurs fans revolt against levy. No spurs fan should attend the games until he leaves or club sold. Absolutely pathetic display of football by the team over and over .. embarrassing 👎
COYG
Wow, another one communicating like a 13yr old. Embarrassing…
Britney Spears Toxic ahhahaha. But for real though, this is exactly Arsenal was going through just 3 weeks ago. football is like this i guess. The team will regroup and play better. They just need some confidence.
50, shades of Arteta😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Mnd had to rewind that time machine part 3 times🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.😂😂😂😂😂.Gooner 4life.

"No Changes!!! It's like 2Pac never even made the song!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂  That 2Pac reference would have had him rolling in his grave.. LOL
Expressions Loooooozing
Son, Lucas, Skipp and Gil are the only players that can hold there heads up,  Skipp and Gil didn't even start the game but did more than the useless lot that did start.
Abysmal performance no competitiveness. You got Kaned
Nuno Nuno Nuno....the 🐔 got seasoned Harry Kane will be fuming playing 🏌️‍♂️ after 20yrs down the line thinking of how Tottenham ruined his trophy less career
Gill was better than Alli Ndombele and hojberg combined the kid has heart and creativity
Jose was a better manager then what you have right now. But you guys couldn’t appreciate it
WHY TOTTENHAM ARE BAD??? ~ Nuno favored formation... 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 Narrow... - LF+CF+RF Stay forward and High Press, no tracking back  - Fullbacks provide attacking width during sustained possession, must be prepared for 1v1 duels and sporadic 1v2 as CMs may not help. ~ Midfield BALANCE is the KEY (Mezzala - Deep-Lying Playmaker - Centre Midfielder) is the perfect balance 2 Mezzalas is SUICIDE...  NOTED: 6 EPL Midfields Nuno selected City | Alli - Skipp - Hojbjerg WIN Wolves | Alli - Skipp - Hojbjerg WIN Watford | Alli - Skipp - Hojbjerg WIN Palace | Winks - Skipp - Hojbjerg LOSE Chelsea | Alli - Hojbjerg - Ndombele LOSE Watford | Ndombele - Hojbjerg - Alli LOSE  Nuno needs to learn player LIMITS if he plays 4 - 2 - 3 - 1... Alli - Mezzala/Front 3... Ndombele - Mezzala... Hojbjerg - Centre Midfielder... Skipp - Deep-Lying Playmaker/Centre Midfielder... Lo Celso- Mezzala/Front 3/Centre Midfielder... Winks - Deep-Lying Playmaker...  - Skipp MUST PLAY...Hojbjerg is NOT a Deep-Lying Playmaker in a Narrow formation - Alli or Ndombele NEVER both - Ndombele/Lo Celso/Gil >>> Alli if we ever think about Alli put him in front 3 - Hojbjerg at Centre Midfielder to press, win possession and play short passes to the real ballers  1st Choice Midfield:  Ndombele - Skipp - Hojbjerg Bench: Alli - Winks - Lo Celso
Should sold Kane. Yet if #Tottenham sold Kane. Daniel Levy wouldn’t know how to use the money to buy better players.
Imagine sacking poch and his the one who goes on and starts managing mbappe, messi and Neymar 😂
Ahhh depressions losing :(
Advil cold and sinus FC
Depressions lOozing.. big up my G, love the channel
I just came back to this channel to laugh at your Tot fans face :) keep changing coach won't save this sh!t team, it's in the DNA lolll.  Mourinho was the best thing you ever had but you stupid fans keep demanding this and that, attacking football blah blah. Wake the f up, you dont have any 'unique style' at all.  It's a derby with the Ars which at the bottom half of the table and you boys couldnt get it done, pathetic.
Man said saka is gona be voss now not the turkish saka water😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Alonzo harris reference 🔥
This guys puns or whatever you call it has been just too funny for far too long now😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ex, your made up names are second to none.
You can easily tell who are bad footballers just by looking at the pitch. I don't know how players like Dele Alli, Eric Dier, and Davinson Sanchez still play top flight football.
I am an Arsenal fan, but I always love watching Ex. Keep up the banter man.
It's de history of de Tottenham
Zero identity!  Biggest take away. We have nothing as a squad other than a kit. And even that changes every week. Not even a sliver of passion throughout. That starts at the pitch line with Nuno. Disappointed is an understatement.
He played a back line of last season when he had Christian Romero. The best defender of Italian league last season.🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
it is good expressions a positive person..supporting spurs can be toxic at this moment
The team needs real help
Nono ain't the one. We never got rid of the crap deadwood an where paying the price, as it's them getting expose
I see Spurs and Nuno have taken inspiration from Chelsea's shirt sponsor 🤣🤣🤣
As a Tottenham fan I gave up 50 yrs last year to just follow,  Spurs fans are deluded, if anyone knows I've been slagging of spurs, they are a proper money orientated club, the bucks stops at levy, tight fucking piss taking chairman. Money buys success but you have to spend to that,.  Ask them about the bunker under the stadium, an why the Jewish community are taking back  thier property's, it's become mini Jerusalem from Stoke Newington to Edmonton. This is why I ain't been back to work. An I'm scared of that massive 5g station thats there
Another example of Kane just being shite in a big game.
As an Arsenal fan FUCK Tottenham, but at the same time feel bad for Expressions. North London is red today though🔴
Shut up expressions your neighbors are trying to sleep 😴 they gonna call the police 👮‍♀️ 👮🏿‍♂️ on you 😂😂😂😂
hello darkness my old friend LOL
shoulda kept mourinho
Here we go. I wish you were a chelsea fun and oozing for us🙌🙌🙌
Lol
North London is 🔴🔴
“I wanted Alli off in the first 20 minutes. Him and Joshua are both Nigerians and didn’t perform. No energy and no speed blud” 🤣🤣🤣
Keep same energy spurs fans lol
Minamino > Kane
How can spurs beat man city, then turn to shit. Players should of been on a high. 9 goals conceded in 3 games. Just embarrassing!
"Bagel FC" lmfao
i can’t take this shit it’s a mess…
Annual leave loading
The only thing he can manage is a Till because its on a counter **DEAD*** , Oozing and Mark Goldbridge should have a rant off with metaphors
Charlie Kane 😄😄😄
Man said i thought i was in a time machine 🤣🤣
Either Nuno goes or Dele.
😂😂 Arsenal 3 Spurs 1
No Nunno slander will be tolerated. Your players are garbage with the exception of Son.
Only thing he can manage is a till 🤣
No manager can win with these diabolical useless players. Stop taking down on Nunno.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"sack nuno and sack himself" WOW
PUT YOU LOT IN A SPLIFF FAMMMMMM. I WAS WAITING ALL DAY FOR THIS VIDEO 😂😂😂😂😂 still love you tho Ex
Enjoyed this :)
. Even if its going shit shaped Lucas and Son try. Gill tried and looked good when he eventualy got on . Done with Dele and gone right off Regulon . Did he even get a cross in ? it was all Pathetic . Lost 3-1 to one of the worst Arsenal sides in years. Well its now one of the worst Spurs sides in years.
This was hilarious from start to finish. 😂😂😂
😂😂 he is definitely a man of culture with these lines
for the first goal it was not the best of balls to Kane but he made no effort to jump or even put the defender off . It was criminal. Then next thing its in our net.  There was no coming back from that .
"You pass the pad fam" 😂😂😂
The way he rants always seems like its scripted 😂🤣🤣
Deli Alli needs to quit playing football and nuno makes us plays terrorist football
I hope everyone realises 3 games before international break, Tottenham were top of the league, and Arsenal were at the bottom, and after only 3 games Arsenal have gotten above Spurs already, dont kid with me how bad this is now
It says a lot that Gary Neville even said to the young players to look at Dele Alli who was supposed to be the best midfielders in the country by now, he was amazing a few years back, and now he's a flop who doesnt care about playing anymore the fame and money got to him, he doesnt have any ambitions on the pitch.
Expressions with his Spurs Wolves shirt 😂. Man is dead out here 🤣
The second Spurs fans get that Tottenham dont care about trophies or going to win anything, but just getting money from the stadium and saving money on the team the quicker you guys can get angry at the heads of Tottenham instead of the players or managers.
GOD BLESS 🙏🙌✝️!!!
I had a dream right after the game it was 8-0
Happy COYG
Sack Nuno then sack himself 💀
Arsenal 3 Tottenham 1…… Spurs done
😂😂😂😂😂
WEARING YOUR WOLVES SHIRT I SEE.
Micheal Jackson FC FAM!
My man said if its fifa u pass the pad fam🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ahahahah fam I’m crying! After being at the game then coming home to this it’s truly perfect 😂😂😂😂😂
Tottenham is going backwards due to the recruiters .  Still baffled how they wasted 30 million on Ryan Sessegnon and at that same time didn't want to pay 25 million for Jack Grelish. Then went and bought Jack Clark for 10 million,  a player that at times couldn't make the Leeds bench in the Championship.
Ofcourse Lucas is going to play hard for his dad
you got jokes
We bought make up to sell man dreams to buy a ticket.  Brinel Messi  Memorial bench RIP Arthur Fowler  It's like Tupac never made Tue song
They put spurs in a grabba leave 😂
The amount of space ESR had. Croydon astronaut
You're a real one Ex!
This bro is a genius …  3 nil first half on fifa you pass the pad lol 😂. So damn true
Conceded 9 goals in 3 games! The whole defence were wearing dat Harry Potter invisibility cloak. Hahaha!
"Croydon astronaut" 😂😂😂😂😂
ENIC OUT!!!
Loooosing sauce
The dad of Lucas mora🤣🤣🤣
Spurs got spit roasted.... copped an anal rogering..... Cream pied
Sacked Poch for Jose n Nuno for this Levi must feel like a right prick now u reap wot u sow
would rather Klinsmann, a man that coached Germany and Bayern Munich and also a Tottenham great. How levy decide on Nuno....I have no idea!
Kane just needs to not start for you man, Spurs better without him, no idea how you didn’t just cash in and got 2-3 players to improve that first 11
3-1 to the Arsenal
How is Dele Alli still at this club? 🤔
3 London derbies, 3 losses, 3 goals per game conceded. At least Spurs are consistent
Nuno out
Nooo he actually said RIP Arthur fowler 🤣🤣
Give Nuno time he needs time to sort this out!
who is man, he is talking about?
Spurs are either Frank Ocean FC they Lost, Lost in the heat of it all.... Or Jay Sean FC cos they going down, down, down.....
Man said  “ deli ali can’t press them man just press gyal “  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stat tomiyasu has not been dribbled past once yet and you bought Emerson for 30 😂😂😂
I'm an Arsenal fan and even I felt sorry for you guys🤣that was a shambles
At least mourinho had you compact and restricted Nuno is a mid table manager
Honestly never compare hojberg to partey no difference one is a experienced champions league top quality mid who’s won titles and was a starter day and day out for atleti the other played for Southampton won nothing and was a starter
Broadwater Farm estate…I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You can banter arsenal you want look at the team arteta had when first here now look at the team now it’s a revamp you guys havnt revamped anything or when you have they havnt worked out
man's style is like a machine gun
Better you had stayed with the big man mourinho
As an arsenal fan.. this shit is more hilarious 😂. U just got a new subscriber mate 😁
WHAT DO WE THINK OF TOTTENHAM SHIT  WHAT DO WE THINK OF SHIT TOTTENHAM  THATS ALRIGHT WE HATE TOTTENHAM WE HATE TOTTENHAM
Shit loss no doubt.  The formation was way too optimistic and didn't offer enough cover for our shaky back 4.    You hit it right on the head.  Why aren't any of the new signings starting?  Every single player was a hold over from Poch/Mou era.  Having said that, it's beyond obvious now that neither of those coaches were what was wrong with our squad.  Also to add, we should and ought to give Romero/Rodon partnership a try because Dier/Sanchez has not and will not work.  Either of them is a mistake waiting to happen.   If we are going to lose, at least play the youngsters and new players.
Chelsea need to give up that 3 mobile shirt sponsorship to Tottenham the 3 custodians
Depressions oozing fc blud😂😂😂
AJ should've fought at the Emirates....
Arsenal fan first time watching Expressions...His word play is unrealllll 😲👌🏽
after just starting to support this team last year, i feel like ive been doing this for years. im just prepared for disappointment. 😭
My man said " 50 shades of Arteta." that's priceless.
Spurs got pounding after pounding
Past da pad 🤣🤣
Haha, a reminder of who Tottenham are today
Sack nuno and then sack him self blood 🤭😅
You said nuno doesn't change anything,  nuno actually change everything, he lost three times in the last three premier league game with different formation and different first team every single games
Like you say - can't blame Nuno for taking the job & pocketing the cash. I blame Paratichi for selling Levy a pig in a poke by convincing him he was getting the Nuno from his Valencia days and the sucker bought it. Now we all have to suffer until the penny drops and Danny boy sends Nuno packing. If the defending is bad what about up front? Just 4 goals in 6 premier league matches, that's dreadful.
you should be on sky sports bruv
13 years of HURT.....damn😮
Expression am an Arsenal fan but I can't miss a single day without watching yo video a joy to watch I just love you Ex meanwhile North London is Red the only thing that is white in London is Ben
How can you  blame kane , without him Tottenham would have been dead yrs ago . Yes he's out of form but he wanted to leave and levy denied him the move . Blame someone else . Song had a poor game to infact no one for spurs had a good game . As for levy he built the stadium and he ain't going nowhere soon
As an Arsenal fan I have to say Tottenham don't deserve Son
Arsenal roasted your bird lol 😂 thanks for not buying Tomiyasu!! Spurs are 💩# North London is 🟥 and always will be!! Troopz says hi lol 😂
Titanic fc mate 😂😭
What trophy 13 years ago?
Man this deserves a bafta
Who told Kane to drop in the CAM positions, or may be he's showing off to Pep Guardiola that he can play as a false nine
So much space he was the Croydon Astronaut lol
Man not won the league in 60 long years FAM
Kane is playing against you 😆. Sooner you man see this the better. You had no midfield. Bagel settings. 🤣🤣
As a gooner, i genuinely rate this guy's content. Not just here to see the meltdown like others do for aftv.   This guy's puns and analogies are next level 🤣
Tottenham should bring in Conte and let him do his thing. Problem is, Levy doesn't want to give up to much power to the coach and that's the main issue.
Mourinho was never the problem for yoy
I don’t know how anyone can support Tottenham😂😂😂, Someone please explain…
😂😂😂😂😂 I’m crying
NORTH LONDON IS RED ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Last time you got embarrassed was against Chelsea im guessing your brain can't reach that far.😭😩
Aarthur fowler bench 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
50 shades of Arteta 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Regulon was on toast and you tried to put him in the combined 11over Tierney 😭😭😭🤣🤣😂
Injecting as I watch... And drinking them spurs tears
”The only thing Nuno can manage is the till, cause it’s always on the counter (with him)” 🤣🤣🤣 That one is clever, took me a few  seconds to clock
nathan redmond catching strays  Lol , as an Arsenal fan, you bantered us too much for this not to be a very sweet moment, from 9 points up in 3 games, to below us after we play yall, lol, what s sport football is....
Sonny...plz escape from our team...
I do feel bad for ex, but I’m an arsenal fan so not too much😅. I’ll drop a like for compensation tho❤️
As an Arsenal fan its been a great weekend
Spurs were out of depth. 4 3 3 wasn't the right line up when I saw team sheet. Arsenal had 4 attack ready to shred. Arsenal had some luck. Spurs as a team were imbalanced.
You better turn up for Best of Enemies this week
🍿 🍿 🍿
Expressions, you are the most entertaining football YouTuber by a mile! Even as a rival fan I enjoy watching wether Tottenham win or lose. Thank you for the entertainment even when I know your pissed off 😂
been waiting for this
« If it was FIFA there would be no 2nd half » LMAO he is the goat
Tottenham didn’t even show up. That was downright pathetic. No effort and the Spurs players didn’t even seem to really care.   Good thing for me is now it keeps Arteta at Arsenal likely all year.
I’m seeing different Kane nowadays. I see noob brother KA-NE
You know them way there
Hahahhaha totty are shittttt
lmao
AM Fuming! You Know Them Way there Blood!
emerson royal vs tomiyasu??? hahaha... tomi like ROCK 🙊
Express yourself like Expressions! He is fuming like a Ganja Pipe pulling smoke!
"We need to sign malcom because we have nothing in the middle" This guy is a fucking genius 😂
The worst part is u can’t even sack Nuno. He was the only one that was ready to take the job after 12 managers turned you down.
We gunner don't get carried away cuz it's only Tottenham
When the 1st goal went in I was like what now ex blud at the 2nd I’m like ur club is shit and at the 3rd I felt sorry for him
Sack himself 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s what you get for always being arrogant. Enjoy
Start Skipp and Gil......sell Kane and use the money
Ex,  we had intent and when we hired Mr .JM & then the Daniel V woke up he was spending to much $$.. Now we have NUNO...the intent is now like Ex wanting to arm wrestle Robbie naked...’Jokes ‘🤣
Saka is Nigerian and performed big time 😂😂😂😂
north london is red ese
🤣😂 in a spliffff
Great win for Arsenal, But I still don’t trust the process. Arteta out!!!
🤣🤣🤣
What trophy 13 years ago ??
RIP Arthur Fowler bench 😂😂
Love this guy. He feels the way I feel about this club, is passionate, vociferous but whatever he says, he's never offensive. He's funny too.
Crappingham Boobspur fam !!!
I smoked hella spliffs when we lost this- made me forget lol - fuck me were awful
Nuno accepted the blame no game plan.
I’m Arsenal through & through but it’s hard not to like you mate.keep doing your thing 👍🏻
LOOOOOOOOL
"Absolutely embarrassed" and "Tottenham" is a natural pairing, just like spoiled meat and dysentery.
Iya i am a Wolves fan for 47 years and wen Nuno gets it wrong his head goes big and serious
You should of sold Charlie Kane bro.
Expressions fuming
The Croydon astronaut 😂 had so much space.... genius! 👍
Tottenham is a mid table bang average team just get used to it the days of top 4 are gone, just accept your place on the pecking order it ain't that deep.
“Titanic fc” dkm😭😭
Before the arsenal game, I said in Tottenham's next 6 games we'd be lucky if we get two points. Now, I'm thinking if we get 1 point we'll be lucky. I'd rather ryan Mason be coach. That is how bad things are.
"They don't care about us.. Michael Jackson FC Fam" 😂😂
Gunners fan here. Just stopped by to laugh.
Depressions Boozing
MIND THE GAP
Spot on 🎯  Ex thank you G.
Appointment Nuno was a terrible statement and a slap in the face to ambitious players like kane. Now I understand why kane is depressed. Imagine having to work for and depend on "the Portuguese Alan pardew".
As an Arsenal fan. The first half was like FIFA Tbh,the playing and those goals was on🔥🔥🔥. He said Saka and Smithrowe looks like pirez against them🤣🤣🤣
Mac makeup? @expressionsoozing???  More like some dead Superdrug shit bro…. I’m vexed!! Seriously, work with 4 gooners - tomorrow is gonna be fucking dead!!!
Expressions is the one and only good thing about Spurs .... facts from an Arsenal fan
”titles unavailable” unfortunately.
Snoop Dogg Doggy style. Mans killing it
You tell it like it is, Oozing. Top lad.
In a sppppppliffffffff 🤣🤣🤣
That Malcolm In The Middle joke was brilliant 😂
man literally said we were gang whored n getting flipping backdoored,no need of a key fam snoop dog city style,this got me cracking 🤣🤣
Spurs midfield looking like Expressions teeth fam. GAPPY.
How many man came from troopzs aftv interview😂😂😂😂😂someone grab my man a magnum hes stresssseddddd😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow best day my like 😂😂😂😂
My team Arsenal yammed and spat out Spurs today. 😂😂😂😂
YOU GOT MERRRKEEEDDD
13 years - I might have well been in the cell. I’m dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Like a chicken,still flapping with a brukd neck
My bruda 🔥
Is Ramos still a manager? Spurs better call him up🤣 or redknapp...
🤣🤣 You ain’t shit for the lil durk one 😭 Still gottaa big up your authenticity and grind my black brother! Oh and it’s still up the Chels 🔵🔵🏆💯
I’ve supported this team since 2015. And this was the most painful game I’ve ever watched. Losing in the ucl final sucked but I said Liverpool were better than us and at least we made it that far so we could try again. Then Bayern, but I said Bayern were the best in the world so I could allow. But not Arsenal blood. Not like this. This game broke my heart in a way I’ve never experienced before.
Spurs have got clowns for defenders, they have allowed 9 goals in 3 games like it's a joke😂😂
Levy must Gooooooooooo ASAP  Levy must Gooooooooooo ASAP
London is red forever
enjoy your harry kane
I am from south London and I have noticed the bitter rivalry between Arsenal and Tottenham.  I don't think we have a similar rivalry in South London.  The fact you both Arsenal and Tottenham fans live close together must be antagonistic to one another?
Ex we the fans are definitely suffering the board don’t care anymore both the board and the manager should go ASAP. Please Ex say something
An LFC fan but I was rooting 4 Tottenham n Ex n the frustration with these constant capitulations r really hard to take...Feel terribly sorry 4 Son coz the lad was at times looking like he wants to take on all of them on by his lonesome 😞 n it's seriously irks 1 on watever is holdin Kane back, n they needa strong headed manager who'll literally give all of 'em kicks up their royal behinds...but chin up Ex n Tottenham since if the good times didn't last long, nor will the bad 1s  either 🙏💯 #YNWA ..
This defeat was SOLELY on Nuno. Sabotaged us by dropping Skipp for dele who was f**cking trash. Our defense was completely left to dry w/o a DM to sit in front of them and stop ESR and Saka
Imagine not watching his videos after a Spurs defeat he is hilarious 😂🤣
wheres your verbs now. ah man city dis man city dat. kinda peak the way we done you. jokes aside funny vid lmao.
Kane Ali ndombele needs to get dropped for 3 games
Harry kane assisted saka. Good partnership.
Ex why did Harry Kane not play today? Hope he’s not out for too long
Tottenham can't win a trophy and joshua can't keep at trophy at spurs 🤣😂🤣
Tottenham should have never sacked poch coming from an arsenal fan
Ex in wolves colours 😂
When Mourinho got sacked you were jubilating 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Delete club start again 😡
Jose's fault...right?
Wasn't it all london teams aswell palace Chelsea now arsenal 🤣😂🤣
Daniel Levy master negotiator, this happened with Rose and Eriksen. Now Kane has checked and gives no fuck. Should have sold him last summer.
I'm done watching these wastemen. Not wasting my time anymore.
Arsenal win happy Sunday thank you Arsenal 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😄😄🇯🇲
LONDON IS RED 🤍❤️
We smoking on Spurs Pack tonight Ex  🚬 🤣
Poch before Tot, didn't enter any European competition or top 6 (not saying Nuno is better than him)
Depressions ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooozing
The spuds are the gift that keeps on giving
Hush ex me happy London is red 😢
Michael jackson fc fam😭😭😭😭🤣🤣
How is the Table now @expression oozing. From Top to 11th and still going down
We need to sign Malcom!!! Funniest thing he has ever said
Play Alli and you will loose
We destroyed Spurs. I'm savoring this for a long time. And none of you can take that away from me 😉
"It was like FIFA. "😹
why is he acting like spurs is a big club
we were oooooooooooozing teaaaaaars!!!!! COYG!!! NORTH LONDON IS RED
YOU KNOW DEM WEY DER FAM
hahahhahahahaahhhaha inhale hahahhaahahahhahaha
Ex is making me start to feel sorry for spurs 😂 they need to go all out to win the league cup this year I reckon
The last time spurs won a trophy I was collecting my gcse's big man ting!😂😂😂
this guy is stressed
I'll remind you, it's when you bottled it in Europa league XD
Harry lame!! Should get man of the match for that assist  😂😂😂😂
Blud and fam
Expressions  you  are the only  Spurs  fan i wouldn't  slag.. Brother  it's only  going  get Worse......
I'm not a Tottenham fan and first time to your channel. Love the vibes but I have to agree with their recently performance
Well at least you know ranting gets you views so fair play.
1:04  Alicia Keys FC
After seeing the Chelsea and Arsenal game today we defo need to start Gil. He’s come on the past two games and impressed. Give him a chance. And as for Emerson being benched? No idea why. He was ok against Chelsea but wasn’t poor enough to be dropped. Can’t wait to get Berjwin back. Drop kane. Start same team as we did against City.
I stf this guy says "fam" and "blud" more then AFTV Troopz, lmfao.
Seriously Son Heung -min needs to leave a trash  side like that HE DESERVE TO PLAY FOR EITHER MC,MU, Chelsea, Liverpool  or Arsenal . He was the only one making a difference for TOT
The bally will make a return at the best of enemies lol
It’s always the better team with a touch of luck wins the game and it was arsenal today. It was arsenal’s day. Although I’m happy seeing my team win, I’m also sad about expression’s depressions oozing. Keep hanging on bro. Things will get better with time.
All dem man press is gyal!! I'm dead 💀
We have 2 problems:   1. Terrible footballers like Serge Aurier (yes we still have him as RB), Eric Dier and DELE ALLI (THE DECLINE OF DELE DID EXACTLY START WITH THE DECLINE OF THIS TEAM)   2. Not good enough manager. Tottenham should be managed by Conte.  Anyway, we move innit, fortunately there's England matches every month.
OK so we can dwell on the bad but positive son got a goal, Moura force ramsdale to make a great save off the bar and Kane miss a easy chance, I think that second half we could have got something out the game, but they won from 30 mins in, congrats gunners but race is not for the swift we will bounce back because I see positive nuno jus need to gel this team n stop playing dele alli he doesn't suit his system
& I thought you man were gonna beat us.😁
Nuno definitely not starting Dele Alli ever again
Man looks like he bout to cry
I could just listen to the first four words alone for this video and still be satisfied .
❤️
Done a DT special ting wiv his phone, gold  😂
Kane is a disgrace and really needs calling out by all the Spurs fans. His unprofessionalism is just something else
Coulda sold Kane for 120.  Gonna sell him in Jan for 75.
My guy said "If it were on FIFA you'd pass the pad" and I felt that.  😭😭😭
Arsenal fan here. Just subscribed for the laughs.
See y you must chill nd watch football..lol a so it go still a our time now if have a laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know it hurts him to say the FIRST FOUR WORDS IN THIS VIDEO 0:00 TO 0:01   XD
"The ting he can manage is a till because is on the counter".....Packed n Smoked where was rodney😂😂😂 North London is red homie
Dele,him n Joshua both Nigerian didn't perform 😂😂😂
If this was fifa, you pass the pad blud 🤣
Sinking like a stone. Relegation awaits. Blame ENIC and Levy
hahahahahahha love it...bedraggled cockerel
Said before fam....conte is a winner n levy shit it
What has Nigeria got to do with the shitty performance of the club?
Expressions I'm hurtin I'm really hurtin
You’ve had your success over the years, and now your team is quickly returning to your rightful position
Titanic FC 🤣
😂😂🤣🤣"the only thing man can manage is a teal, coz everything is on a counter, on a counter blud!!!!"

Champagne football! Never forget it, Mikel Atapas > Moura senior
Absolute fan favourite Ex.
I just want to say this to our players, Dont you at least have the smallest bit of respect to your families ? How do you think your familiars feel when they see and hear how fans speak & react to your miserable performance ??? Think about it you bunch of disgracefull amatueres.
"50 shades of Arteta blud"

Mourinho vindicated.
"50 shades of Arteta!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You got W-WASHED FIRST HLF😂

Hope you win conference league
Not even Sam Allardyce would be interested after this meltdown.
Depression oozing must be buzzing watching Champagne football
Just say thanks to levy yet again
50 shades of Arteta ha ha ha haaa. This mans a true comedian. better than any pros.
Take a shot every time he said “you know that way there”
NLD🔴🔴🔴🔴
London is Red ❤️
DEPRESSIONS OOOOZING BLUD
hahahaha
Ferguson to Mourinho at United: Buy Dele Alli   🤣🤣🤣
Come on Arsenal 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I'm an Arsenal fan and very realistic about football views. Tottenham's biggest mistake was sacking pochettino. We are backing a manager whose got the club back to back 8th while y'all sacked a manager who was a step away from European glory
50 shades of arteta 🤣🤣🤣
Take a break bro, we really need you, cause very soon you might have a heart attack. Expressions, you are passionate man, but you are flogging a dead donkey man. This team is cow dung. Its a total disaster. Put nuno in the mix and everything is just a maze. Kane is non existant, psychologically, the man is a just a wreck. The buck stops with Levy. There is this old saying which says, you cannot take a horse to the river and force it to drink. Why force kane, his heart is not with spurs. Jose did not play dele, he knew the guy was pompous for nothing, very lazy. Is he adding any value to the team, be the jury. There is no life in that team everybody is like a frankenstein. Reaping the rewards for chasing jose.
The only white thing in London is Ben
I haven't even watched the video and I liked it.
Depressions Looozing
Spurs last result’s  3-0 L vs Palace 2-2 D vs Rennes 3-0 L vs Chelsea  2-2 D vs Wolves 3-1 L vs Arsenal
Auba has won himself a PES/FIFA advert celebration video. The future is bright for us with lots of young stars in our club. Our defence is our secret which is mostly d lucky sign of Tomiyasu at right and Gabriel now making Ben white shine by covering for each other.
Michael Jackson fc loooooool 😅😅😅
"we Morgan Freeman FC"  😂😂😂
Even AJ lost his title at white Hart Lane 🤣
"Premier League pack of polos" this man is a genius for coming up with these descriptions of the Spuds.
Man was crying in the stream 😂😭🤣😭
Nathan Redmond and Lucas moura dad..Nuno 😅😅😅
50 shades of arteta 😂😂😂
As an Arsenal fan - I feel for you guys, you usually give us a fight.
VOSS water 💧 💧💧💧
50 shades of arteta 🤣🤣
Could have sold Kane for £120-130m and would have had plenty to reinvest but Levy bluffed and Pep called it
You man are finished loooool
Harry Kane needs cocain to get sommat out of him
arsenal fan here .....im enjoying this ... 😂😂🤣🤣
Im still supporting ex if he do other comedies....he jokes is unmatchable
Free Kane!
Man said put in a time machine 😂
Fam! Fam , fam...fam.......fam, you get me? Fam!
Please tell me what holjberg brings to the team ..can't pass can't run can't tackle watch first goal he was walking back
I told you, Crystal Palace put you in a spliff, Chelsea put you in a blunt and ARSENAL SMOKE YOU!😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌🏾🙌🏾 hold that! You’re always vocal chatting shit so tonight you will go bed silent! Smoke a big spliff and hold that 3! 🤣🤣🤣👏🏾
New Spurs Pack in the air this gas or what.
Like for Nuno out
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
'We need to sign Malcolm, nothing in the middle'🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best of enemies 😹
This club is a joke. Didn't get why they got rid of Mourinho before a cup final. Don't get why they hired Nuno who is even worse than Jose and plays way more defensively.  Don't get why many mediocre players are still at spurs.  Don't get why Son extended his contract.
Expressions is too funny 😂
DEM EARS OF YOURS BLUD 🤣🤣🤣 U LOOK LIKE SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT OF LORD OF THE RINGS FAM🤣🤣🤣 U KNOW DEM BOY THERE BLUD FAM!!!! BIG MAN TING. EX U DRIVE ME 2 TEARS LAUGHING AT U NOT WITH!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Levys fault bought in Jose and Nuno two defensive managers. Paratici sack him too he told levy to bring in Nuno sack all the board 8-9 of the 1st team players we are gonna struggle all season
You forgot about Bergkamp. Not only did you get thumped, you got thumbed 😜
I said with troopz u were going to win 1 0 you liar
Levy is money orientated
Could literally not believe the first 10 mins, was like Spurs were all just standing still and letting Arsenal run around them. The lack of effort and movement is absolutely shocking. Skipp, Gil, Romero and Rodon all have to start next game, Dele and Kane need to be dropped. 3 years of utter shit now, nothing will change until ENIC and Levy are out.
He looks disable in the thumbnail😂
EXPRESSIONS LOOOOOOSING SAAUUCE
Losing 3 games on the bounce, remember how funny that was?
Tottenham are turning into Arsenal last season, when the main guy isn't scoring u need to find other ways to score
Troopz wannabe on the 👃 candy
I give up on Spurs
I couldn’t wait for this 😂😂😂
Coulda been 5 or 6 home and dry if we had a better Manager. Seriously you man shoulda sold Kane. Another dumb decision by your board...not that my club has been any better at decision making since they decided to move the new Stadium.
🤣🤣🤣
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Wait there's more!!!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Depressions Oozing
Are you oozing Simon!
Nuno deserves criticism but look at these players. Shoulders down, blank expressions, trudging down to the centre circle every goal. Unfit to wear the shirt most of them. Downed tools after 6 games. They're a disgrace.
Kane fell off tremendously
Michael Jackson FC 😂😂😂
Yo Expressions, abeg leave us Nigerians out of this 😭😂 with AJ loss, we have a lot we're dealing with right now
Bro it makes no sense you rant like this anymore
https://youtu.be/HADHCIAv7zw
Tottenham is all chicken, how can a chicken play in a Gun fight impossible London is Red and has always been Red
😂😂😂😂aaah my guy Ex.. Morgan Freeman Fc  🔴⚪️

😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Depression Oozing😂😂
🤫
Arsenal fan here. Haha Tottenham will forever be in our Shadow.
Its jose,s fault🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was a predictable result with Undombele, 60 Million invested world-class player AKA 50-min man. You recon over half of the squad is performing below average PL quality. Keeping Undom was the biggest mistake. Along with him, I think there are at least 5 more players who need to go this winter transfer.   Spurs had a chance to sign Kim min jae (15 Mil), Kang In Lee (free transfer from Valencia), and Adama (who wants to come to SPURS) but Noooooooooooooooo. The board decided to keep the deadwoods and sign more average players. I think Gil was the only player who looks very promising and perhaps the best signing this summer. Look at the BIG 4 teams and what they did this Summer transfer. Spurs could have done the same they let H.K. go.  Stupid decisions usually lead to Stupid results.
Pants down FC. Arteta was plotting while we were all laughing at him and making memes.
😁😁😁
Nothing in the middle, premier league pack of polos, bagel fc. If only Spurs were that creative
On the bright side spurs scored 😂😂
30 years without a trophy, that’s a life sentence
I love you expressions best fan everr😂😂😂😂😂😂
Could only press gayl . That’s why he was pressing peps daughter 😭
Dier is a terrible defender, simple the second goal dier saw auba running and he should have closed up on auba instead he went to lloris and said hi
Don't tryed to arsenal compare with their shit club any more we told you more time your club was championship club.
Once you guys are finished laughing at my boys pain. Feel free to come over to the calmer and more serene side of YouTube for my match reaction! 👀😂🔴
Micheal Jackson Fc. Made my night.

Forget a spliff you man got put in a bong. Lungsed
Troopzes day  today Expressions there no shame to become a gooner better to be a gooner than a spurs fans
I could tell from the warm up that only mora and regulon would be up for the game. Rest of your squad looked like they just came out of bed.
"you know dem way dere blud"
Arsenal Fan here to hear Expression RANT.
Anybody sign Harry is gonna win the league 😂 Harry fraud
Man said all dem man press is gyal
this is the first time I've seen an EXPRESSIONS video, but this was the best rants I've ever seen😭, i completely lost it when he said " I've been sayings these guys need to sign some school teachers cause this defence cant mark"😭
They were loosing sauce...
ARSENAL WAS USYK TOTTENHAM WAS AJ BATTERED!
Pass the pad 🤣😂🤣
🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣
Croydon astronaut 🤣🤣🤣👀👀🤣🤣 I can’t breathe 🤣🤣🤣👀
Any Spurs alternative fan channels ? Can’t cope with “bun it” “blud” “fam”  “dem way dere”
MJ FC lol 🤣
Give nuno time he has only come
Flipping awful day but brightened up a bit by Expressions. "Arthur Fowler memorial bench", genius 🤣🤣
My man is hurting 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
At the starting of the season you went out of your way to put arsenal down and big up your new manager.... Karma
Daniel Levy ‘Annual Leave’ 🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆

This is the video I've been waiting for😂😂😂😂
IT'S GOTTA BE KANE IT'S GOTTA BE KANE
Harry kane Danny phantom 😂
Hey Expressions if you do read my comment I want you to give me an honest answer. Would you rather wear an Arsenal shirt or a Tottenham shirt with Campbell on the back of the shirt? And would you do that for a lot of money?
I don't why Nuno took profit tanga business out n put in emerson 😠
U know dem way der?
We will lose to Villa
Spurs have a trophy The Audi Cup.
The only Spurs fan Channel where the guy takes my mind off the game and just focus on his jokes. Expressions is a satirical genius
This geezer is fuckin hilarious!.. quality 😂😂😂
Rushed around like a cunt and finished work early to go and watch that shit!!
“if this was fifa thered be no second half” so true loool
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ we need to sign Malcom ㅋㅋㅋ I just got it Malcom in the middle
I thought Tottenham won the league 3 weeks ago 😂🤣
😂😂😂 and Jose is flying 🤔
He said can you believe this, can you actually believe this🤣 YES I can believe & was expecting it 👍
I’m having a great day! Both Ladies and Men’s teams won their matches and scored plenty of goals ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤣🤣🤣
Mura next week in ECL. You might win that one not so bad.
I got no excitement or motivation for Tottenham from the day Nuno was hired. He doesn't play football with exciting pattern, nor he is a proven winner or showed a potential for good football or a potential for winning. Not sure if players are going to give him that respect
Man like Morpheus managing Spurs
Kane a good player doh always makes me laugh
Britney Spears 😂😂
Today i feelt sorry Ex.  But much love for Arsenal
Oozing L’s
When the brown stuff 💩 hits the fan, it splatters. That’s what’s been happening the last 3 weeks.
😂😂😂😂 This is fun to watch
"A rounders bat". Expressions easily my favourite Spurs fan.
mourinho used to park the bus, nuno parks the rickshaw😂😂😂
"Charlie Kane"."Straight forward jacket football"!!!!!!!!!!😁😂😃
Harry kane was practicing his dance moves today 🤣🤣.
We are Morgan freeman FC blood that shit had me pissing myself lol 😂
Michael Jackson FC Toothless FC  Titanic FC 😂
I'm not sure what is more enjoyable, Totenham fans upset, United fans Upset, Arsenal Fans upset or City...Wait, are there City fans???
😂 i😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
xD you jinxed it on that interview on AFTV or wherever it was
Daniel ek was at the game   I hope the Arsenal takeover work
RIP Arthur Fowler memorial bench. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love Expression’s passion for his club. No sympathy as I am a Gooner. Keep it going Levy, you’re doing a magnificent job. 🤣🤣🤣
Got to respect ✊ Expressions
3 games ago “top of the league” trophy FC , can’t believe Spurs thought they were gonna get something out of this game , North London is 🩸always has been 😂😂😂😂
Afc fans are here for you ❤ I'm loving it...
The analogies are on point
You talk to much blud
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
The only thing I’m happy to see is Harry Kane’s value depreciate each game he plays in. Exactly what Levy and Enic deserve.
Nice to see that the narrative has changed. A few weeks back it was always 'Arsenal put in a spliff' and now its Tottenham shitspur put in a spliff 3 weeks in a row 💀
Titanic FC! 🤣🤣🤣 Love this guy!
Also is it funny that that sh*tlimpet who just won't BUDGE is called LEVY? 🤔
As an Arsenal fan I hate all things Spurs except Expressions. The guys a legend.
The only way out of Tottenham for Kane is to do what he is doing, thats what Levy gets for being greedy, shot himself in the foot that fool
Don’t get too exited it’s mid table teams derby so any result is possible.
I'll keep saying it wait until arsenal play city utd Leicester liverpool. They played Chelsea and lost to us 2-0 there was no chest there. Let's see how mouthy they get then coz I know they'll fucking shit it. They never played a good spurs. Spurs made em LOOK good. They cant beat hibs Celtic or rangers in pre season. Arsenal fans CANT chat about spurs lol. Ur a b tech barnet in disguise. Again let's see how big ur talk gets with city liverpool Leicester utd and Chelsea again.
saw your debate about best 11 with troopz, how many spurs players would have got in the arsenal team today  big fat 0
looks like "one of tottenhmams" own was loooooooooosing sauuuuuuuce. thank you for the assist harry. arsenal through and through
Michael Jackson FC fam 🥴🤭 #TheyDontReallyCareAboutUs
Expressions in a time machine!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man I don't want to hear anything about Tottenham until Thursday, today's performance was embarrassing, man had a chance to win 3 London derbies, the 1st manager to do so n he fucked the whole thing up, the manager of the month my foot, man don't know how to use Kane, he is just forcing him into the team expecting he would up in a good performance but he is being useless, we started brilliantly against City without Kane, why doesn't he put the same line up as City, cos Kane isn't playing well anymore, u know what, levy is destroying Tottenham blud, promising us fake things, that nigga can go to hell,  when arsenal were told to trust in the process, we were laughing when they got stung by the bees, but look now where the process has put them, we have became from the best team to the worst in just 2 months, blud I'm frustrated😠😠
Well done Levy, if Spurs fans have any self respect they will march up to Levys house with burning pikes and sticks and force him to answer, lovely stadium but thats it.
Honestly who supports  spurs? 😂
Drop kane
Expression at his best...spurs please keep on losing 🤭
'The performance and game-plan were not good' say No-no. Buck up chap! That's only the players and yourself you're coating off. There's always....erm...oh wait...WE'RE FXCKED! (#LEVYOUT)
🤣🤣🤣
Kane < €100.
We could have had Tomiyasu, but No, Levys' arrogance and tight arse nature fucked it up again. We get Emerson and he's on the bench! A fecking joke.
Cringe blaming nuno when this man make wolves play better football than arsenal and spurs for the past 5 year. Your team have the same player that let pochettino and mourinho down. They will do the same thing to other managers. If you want to blamed someone blamed daniel levy
As an Arsenal fan I was scared but I the team selection was awful. All of our signings featured in the game while your team was the same as last year... what even is that about?
Nuno is just a bald Mourinho. Same tactics and players from last season’s derby .
😂all ali can press is gal
😂
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Oooozing Ls
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Spurs problem was never the Coach but it's players, it's owners and the fans. Replace the above and get a second league coach and the team will perform. Last time Coaches sought changes, the ownership and players grouped cheered by fans to sack worthy coaches.  The players who messed previous coaches are still present in the club: Ali, Dele etc.
50 shades of Arteta…brilliant video Ex
Tottenham sucks
Lovin the MJ TDCAU reference
Justice
Poch after we built the stadium : "when you buy a new house , you must also buy furniture and get rid of old furniture" or something like that. That metaphor still applies today.

always a pleasure buddy, great to see you in a good mood today. blessings for the rest of the weekend, until we meet on the battlefield again.
Great video , very honest about Spurs situation, Daniel levy is the problem
Can we agree Jose wasn't the problem. Biggest issue is Levy, Dele, Winks. I agree X Not good enough
The man dele just presses gyyaaalll hade me dyingg🤣🤣🤣
Beating 3 nil thrice in the league 😂embrassing
Now that the biggest embrassement losing to arsenal than chelsea.. it not the coaching problem it still the player problem.. remember jose.. dont blaming the coach again.. know your fact before criticies...
toxic fc🤪🤪
Harry kanes value  now  not a clue  levy could have banked 100 Mil  now they would have to give him away
not Daniel Levy.it's annual leave 🙌🙌
Conte thanking God he refused to manage you
Nuno out Graham Potter in who  agrees
Bro there's just something about watching a game were Tottenham Hotspurs is losing knowing expression gone give us quality content😂😂😂😂
I've been looking forward to this reaction almost as much as I was looking forward to the result.
Keep the deal ex 😂😂😂
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us😭😂😂😂😂
We need Malcolm because we got nothing in the middle, yoooo
3:28
The nicknames u give the players need changing up ex 🤣 cause these man are wetter then Whitney Houston’s last joint! ✌🏽
Ha ha ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this guy is so funny
When he said we Morgan freeman fc, I died 😂😂😂😂 Memorial bench 😂😂😂 Alli was invincible from the first minute Tanganga for me was best player
Fifteen shades of Arteta 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂💥
We were wondering if you're alright, after watching you yesterday with Troopz. See the correct line up now pal? North London is red.🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
we're loooooozing
We have been roggered by Levy for 20yrs
Tottenham look like a club in big trouble
Man can’t press that’s why he isn’t pressing for Pep but instead he’s pressing Peps daughter
Everything's on the counter🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jennifer Lawrence fc 🙄
My man did a DT during the live stream. He nearly broke his phone…twice! 🤣
The only reason i dont hang myself after  spurs match is knowing ill watch this guy spit facts🤣
Good luck with your Emerson peasant 🤣😂
Shocking performance
Your 💩 stadium cost AJ his title to. He should have gone somewhere with a winning vibe round place instead of crickets 🦗 and moths fc 😂😂😂
When we win its not a good show so I'm done🙄
The midfield  is  shit
Depressions Oozing
It's not that bad Ex. I saw us lose 0-5 at home just before Christmas. THATS BAD
We need to sign Malcom nothing in the middle fam hahahah 😂 ex 90s references are comedy. He ain’t saka no more fam, he’s not that water you buy from bossman shop 😂😂😂😂😂
50 shades of Arteta for me 😂😂😂
Man is not telling you Poch lost 13 games in a season and was 14th the following season. Man seem to have a memory blackout when it comes to Poch.
Conference League…😭
bring school teachers in to teach marking,,, brilliant
COYG
Croydon Astronout the man had bare space 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Man said backdoor like lil Durk 😂😂
Up the Gunners
13 years.... you mean the carling Cup 😂 are you actually counting that lol
Expression wearing Wolves colours, credit to Nuno.
North London is red bitch♥️
Go bun a split and drink some rum or something fam!
Croydon Astronaut 🤣🤣🤣 I’m Arsenal until I die. But I’m happy to listen to Expressions any day of the week 😂 my guy needs to be on live at the Apollo. Don’t worry Expressionz mate. Extreme Rules is on later, the head of the table is on. Neither of us are on to nothing anyway
Man said its not Saka anymore it's Voss I'm crying omd 😂😂😂😂😂
Man City will stay away from Class C Kane. His legs have gone!
Anyone get the Morgan freeman reference?
stop the bloodclaat crying 😭😭
You know dem way there fam
🔴⚪️
They don’t really care about us😂😂😂😂😂
“You know dem way dere” no, no I don’t actually
Fifty shades of Arteta 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You could've got £150 million for him and used it to get two or three quality players. But im so glad you didn't HAHAHA!!!
"Croydon Astronaut" HAAAAAAA HA HAHA
I’m not buy tickets tomorrow to watch us lose again, fuck that! I’ve already told my son I’m not wasting my money...what a load of shit
It's so clear Harry Kane wants to not be anywhere near spurs.  The decision to keep him against his will has been terrible. He will move out in a much lower price with a broken legacy at this point.
ARSENAL! ARSENAL!
Nuno isn't the problem.... spurs need quality defenders... that back line is shit.. I feel Expressions pain.
these are some great music references LMFAOOOOO
North London is red you mugs 💪🖕🏼👁️🔴
Spurs putting the No in Nuno
I had a feeling tot are down the drain the moment they sack the coach that took the to the ucl final .
Anyone who's supported the club for over 20years knows that Daniel Levy is the real cause of failure at this club.
I stopped watching the game qhen they scored 2 . We suck
i said it then and ill say it now, rejecting a 160 millon offer will bite us so hard in the ass. kane is good but the lack of players all round the team shows that his selling would be a brillant thing for the team, use the only fucking thing levy is good for and get a bit of fucking money
You're shouting for nothing Mr.. arsenal  we outdated spurs in all the areas.. overreacting.
You still got Son & Kane, so the worst is yet to come XD
All the man press is GYAL😭😭
Mid Table derby was lit  xD
You low-key asked for this when you started supporting Tottenham geez 🥴🤣🤣🤣
London is red🔴🔴🔴🔴
Man's crying 🤣 2:48
Spurs is 💩💩💩💩💩💩
Where's ya tongue now Fam me GATE13sw6 Cfc crew £300 spuds on you lot and you do that fucking embarrassing EX ! We let you land !!
Big up Oozing. Lovely assist from Harry for his bro Saka⚽️🔴🇯🇲
F - ing Shakespeare of football punditry. All he can manage is a till.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Depressions losing, just know. You're dem way de
Pass the pad 😂😂😂 spot on 🔥
Y’all got smoked like a  Wiz Khalifa smoke session 😂😂😂
Harry Kane, you know the rest, missing!!!!  LEVY is killing this football club, if you don't want to buy quality players you will struggle in this league. Not a football club anymore, entertainment , music, concert arena. Dele is finished, best years already behind him. Going to be a long season for us spurs fans. ENIC out!!!!
Turned saka from bossman shop water to vos water, expressions jokes are next level
The amount of bars and double entendres in this one got me weak 🤣🤣🤣
"Croydon astronaut with the amount of space" 🤣🤣 how does he come up with these 🤣
50 shades of Arteta Lmao!! 😂😂
Am enjoying your reproach lolz
When Arsenal scored the 3rd goal, Expressions went silence. Unbelievable🤯🤯🤯🤣🤣🤣💩🤫🤫🤫
This reaction has to hit million views
Premier league polos 🤣
Scenes when Ryan Mason returns to the dugout, on some Return of the jedi type of thing
The only thing he can manage is a till, because it's on the counter 😂😂😂
“Croydon astronaut”🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭💀💀
Got time 4 u ex but u lot got put in a spplllliiifffff couldn't be happier
Spurs needs Potter but hopefully Nuno goes on a semi decent run 🤣🙏
Arsenal stole Spurs heart tonight
EX called Smith Rowe a Croydon astronaut🤣😂🤣🤣🙄
😂 Titanic FC Blud 🚢
And Y’all sacked Mourinho for this?
When you select Real Madrid as your opponent in Fifa but as soon as the match starts you realize that you've set the difficulty in legendary mode without even setting the controls.
You were Ooooozzzziinnnggg goals NLD is RED!!!
Only thing he can manage is a til 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Back to back 3 goals 😂
Harry kane is the problem stop fucking blaming Nuno... Kane has poisoned the dressing room and doesn't even wanna be on the pitch in Tottenham colours
What did Robbie say to you?? You don't get gassed after 3 games!!! Mind what gap? Hahaha....I'm loving this....and I'm not getting carried away. I think we (Arsenal) are a work in progress and we showed up for the derby. Kane is paying Levy back...he should have sold him rather than have a disgruntled player on your side. Sure he'll play but not at 100%.
6 cows 🐄 and 5 cat 🐈
the only good thing about this game was, Ex will get more views and more $$$$ on the way.😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Always in our shadooows
“Big man ting from Arsenal, u know dem way der, not gonna lie” lol
Everytime you wake up and look in the mirror your a embarrassment you need rehab your a alcoholic clown
He’s drank 😂
Just Arsenal fan saying hello 👋
Nice of harry potter to loan his invisible cloak to kane
I think it's time to drop Kane & Dele  I think for the game on NS Mura we need to start...  Gollini, Tanganga, Romero, Rodon, Davies, Winks, Skipp, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Gil, Son   Subs: Austin, Doherty, Sanchez, Sessengon (if fit) John, Hoijberg, Dele, Lucas, Scarlett
Nah dawg Harry Kane does not want to play for Spurs at all😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣.....I had to catch this reaction...."memorial bench...rip Arthur Fowler"...😂😂...
Now you know what Lamela brings to the game
Dude I thought he was actually a real Comedian but he isn't. However, I think Expression can be a very good comedian, I dont know how he came up with all his jokes and analogies.
Both Portuguese managers Mourinho and Nuno we're both top of the league and they got manager of the month and afterwards they went downhill, I'm seeing a similar pattern.
I love you EX when spurs lost 🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
I come here on normal days when Tottenham lose, imagine how gassed I am about to watch this as an Arsenal fan knowing how poor we've been.🤣🤣🤣
Now that Alli and Joshua are not performing they are now Nigerians. Such bias.
Oozing loses fam!!!
Nuno dem way der
Nuno should be working at the till/register because the only thing he knows is the counter....nice
Dele like Joshua. No energy fam
They only brought in nuno because no other manager wants the Spurs job 🤣🤣🤣
“Mourinho would’ve done better than this” says it all. Of course he would. Kane is completely useless now mourinho gone. Nuno don’t know how to use slow kane
Expressions looooozing 😂😂😂
Ex and chill 😂😂
blud, ting ,fam , blah blah blah i dont care about your non-understandable language we just won 3-1 HAHAH
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DEAD FOOD FAAAAAM
Yo if I dont get a shirt saying ' I've had enough blud' I'm done out here😂😂😂
Arsenal got the younger team but they looked like the men them man turned into adults moving like pedos the way we touched spurs given you backshots these man are going home to their wives violated BackPain FC
13:09 "Fifty Shades of Arteta blud!" 😂😂😂😂😂
Premier league pack of polos😂😂😂😂😂😂
Remember when most of the spurs fans said they taken Nuno from wolves when actually he was sacked
Alli shows more desire simping for Pep's daughter than he has for spurs. Dele is finished
"Pass the pad" tho!!!!! hahaha
Only son is playing great and he’s the one score .. Harry Kane is not right ATM … spurs did not replace Bale , Ericsson, Trippier…! ( I’m a diehard arsenal fan.. I love to watch this friend Expressions …! )
Michael jackson fc Snoopdog fc

No trophies for 13 years? 😂😂😂 So you are actually going to count that tin pot Carling Cup as a trophy? LOL!! You need to go back to 1991 to say you won a proper trophy! 🤣🤣🤣
Who is running this great club now.Levy...nu noooooo or para tricky......reports come out during the week sayin that we didn't employ Fonceca because he wants to play attacking football. But but that parro person wants to play defensive football.....hear me loud. WHEN WE AINT GOT NO BACK. Flatter then a pancake. An not them fluffy ones.... it's like asking Stevie Wonder to cook a pancake without da correct ingredients...... ITS PROPER PPEEEEAAKKKKK
This brudda is me I swear down we run the same kinder jokes - man said they got 13 like rimzee and they didn’t even shot at the feds 🤣🤣🤣 I’m dead off

It's always good to show that "Relegation" Arsenal still show Spurs that they are banter FC. 1st place thinking they won the league in 3 games now 11th 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kane's heart isn't at Spurs anymore. What was Levy thinking holding onto him? Did he really think Kane was gonna come back hungry to bang goals for them with pride like before?
😂 Hot Spliff FC Blud
Man City will come back in for Kane on 1st january with a bid £60 mill.Of course Levy will reject it so kane goes no where,and spurs are stuck with a player who doesn't want to be there and they can't sell and Man City will wash there hands of him.
North London's RED!!!!!
I love it eating humble pie  expression  remember when arsenal was bottom of the table karma is a B
Expressio and Depression and Tim sherwood.Levy better get 70ml for Kane next year.

Here for my fix 🤣🔴⚪️
Arsenal is on  🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏿
Expressions metaphors are on another level! TITANIC FC!
Tottenham Hotspur holding back Expressions from greatness
"NO CHANGES!!! IT'S LIKE TUPAC NEVER EVEN MADE THE SONG!!!!"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Since I’m the only honest football fan let me state the issue. 1. Tottenham shouldn’t have fired mourinho. They’d have had a better chance to win the EFl cup, finish in a Europa position, have Kane playing better and actually improved the squad. 2. They shouldn’t have hired a coach that haven’t won anything. He’s playing the same players who bottled last season and expects them to not bottle this season? 3. Tottenham need to accept the reality they’re not a top team. What brought them up in the discussion was consistent top 4 finish for a few years and 1 overachieved champions league campaign. 4) Tottenham needs to understand that to be successful you have to have patience, an actual sporting director, spend money wisely and have an actually good manager.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every time u play us ex u get embarrassed at the Emirates
Expressions delivers again, I bet more of us arsenal fans on here than Spurs #hidingFC 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
I feel sorry for Ex…Sorry mate…
The man overreacting like Spuds wins things.

The only thing white in North London in Ben White...
told you man we'd put you in a spliff.
Sol Campbell was right 🤣
Ex acc kills me man. Every time
Spurs, the gift that keeps on giving 😂
Fam, I BEEN saying since the infamous January transfer window with Harry Redknapp that Lord Emperor  Levoldermort needs to go, step down, Whatever!!  How do we finish 2nd, and then go on a self imposed transfer ban and allow every other team to do major business and get 3yrs ahead of us?   We Spurs fans were dissing ArseAnal last year about relegation football yet we finished just above them by 1 point, so what does that make us???  I'm not even blaming Nuno.. we COULD scream "Nuno Out" but then what?? Another weak choice head coach not manager gets recruited, doesn't get backed by Levoldermort, gets sacked, then right back to square one.  Until you Spurs fans are ready to join me in being a armchair supporter and no longer buying ANY merchandise, and that includes kits, teacups, bathrobes, keyrings etc... You lot need to start taking Serious action instead of saying "Levy Out" but then renewing your season tickets because "someone else will buy it though".... WHO GIVES AF!!! Time to make a stand or watch our club fall further And faster than ArseAnal
So bad at the minute manager needs to go and spend some money
Every weekend is like getting slapped round the face with a wet fish 🐠
Hi
Tottenham Shitspur lose again 😂😂😂😂
Arsenal free and tottenham one...these english accents kill me
Depressions Oozing
Spurs done, who's next
My favourite youtuber😂😂cracks me up always.....
You can see it in his eyes. This man either went to bun a spliff or shed a few tears over being put in a spliff.
The English press praised Kane and son for their form and bashed mourinho for poor coaching.. But now it seems the coaching was good but the players are crap.
Can only manage a till because it's on the counter. This coming from an arsenal fan I really like him
Blame levy blud, for keeping kane against his will
Should have cashed in on Kane ... could have got 2 class players in
Man called saka Voss swear I love this guy 🤣🤣🤣
Karma for acting like you’d won the league in September
Mourinho to Nuno. Sacked mourinho to replace him with a c tech version of himself😂
Had to watch the Chelsea game reaction to warm up for this one 🤣 ex never fails
Looking forward to best of enemies I hope Robbie really grills him. COYG!
😜👍🖖👊
Ex loosing his head, North London is red, 34 minutes on the clock, We scored the 3rd 😂😂
Harry Kane wasn't the issue! You're out of your depth Ex! Harry Kane was better than Son today! Kane was just unlucky and should of had a pen. The issue was Dele, Sanchez, Dier,Regulion, Nuno and the main issue, Levy/Enic!
Speak English seriously
Depressions boozing
We were all waiting for this
"the dad of lucas Moura" im so dead rn 😂😂🤣🤣😭😭
Love to it 😂😂😂😂
‘Expressions Boozing’ Might be the best thing I’ve seen all year
BENCH CHOKIN KANE , NUNO NO MORE, LEVY SIGN SOME PLAYERS , DELE GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE PERFUME AND PLAY, STOP THIS MADNESS STOP THE MADNESS GET RID OF CHOKIN KIND KANE!  I love my SPURS  no lie, this gal rom Bronx NYC, loves the Spurs .... BUT COME ON NOW!!!!!! TOXIC!!!
COYG 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Arsenal literally only scored 2 goals all season, then against Spurs they score 3 in half an hour 🙃🤣 I’d feel sorry for Spurs fans if they weren’t pro-Zionist tw@s who support apartheid, you deserve to be a joke club
I genuinely spilled my coffee at Nuno - dad of Lucas Moura and Nathan Redmond blood! May be he has said it before, but am in splits!
3:47 man said pass the pad we call this one “whitewashed” ahliee 😭😭
Lucky for u Son scored once,or else u guys below Arsenal on GD 🤣🤣
Put Harry Kane on the bench and we will be top 4.
Awful performance. We need to get rid of Nuno ASAP. Job is to big for him. Wolves was his level. Dele Ali was shocking as was most of the team. Our defence shouldn’t be taking a pay packet today. Why we sold lamela and Toby Alderwield is beyond me. Why didn’t the board sign a creative midfielder something we desperately need and why didn’t we freaking sign a back up striker who can come and change the game aaaaaaagh.  Levy out Nuno out Antonio Conte in Nuno will struggle to keep us in the top ten. Get rid cut our losses and get Conte or Mancini in. Give them anything they want in the January transfer and get rid of the deadwood.

Kane is about to join in when we chant what do we think of tottenham,i bet he's open to the idea of doing a Sol Campbell.
BANTER FC 3 : 1 NO TROPHY FC

We felt sorry for you that’s why we gave you one goal, enjoy the “we beat Arsenal 1-0 in the 2nd half” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ben over gyal tek buddy rite hahahaha
Spurs on free fall right now. Should bench Harry Kane tbh
Das bangin mate
Lucas moura’s dad🤣, never gets old
We need new owners!  Nuno has to go!  Sanchez and Dier needs to be ****ing sold!  Dele hasn't been able to successfully develop his game and play deeper! Looks clueless in the mid.   Nuno looks clueless it's unbelievable! Has to go as well! But Levy's the real issue! Same as Enic!
I never see your voice is that  low in the stream 😂🤣🤣😂  London is what ex? And troopz incoming 😂
💥 spurs will always be spurs💥 😂😂😂
I never  thought I would miss Ryan mason We played so well under him 😑 Banged in 4 goals vs Sheffield 2 vs wolves 4 vs leceister 2 vs Southampton too 😵Now we aren't getting more than 1
Free Sonny.
Quick the arsenal attack
Tomiyasu says hi😂😂😂😂
13 minute video = 13 years no trophy 😂😂

A team with no passion desire or heart will always struggle. It is not good enough players need to take responsibility
