Here's ANOTHER Madden 22 Gameplay + My Initial Thoughts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0qZQz2u9I
fifa is the most realistic game
Mate. Do you ever stop talking?
☝️I got the best service from them☝️ Legit and trustworthy I love them for that
☝️I got the best service from them☝️ Legit and trustworthy I love them for that
☝️I got the best service from them☝️ Legit and trustworthy I love them for that
The fact they haven't fixed the crowd for the last 13 years. Yet, NCAA 2003 had a proper crowd and atmosphere
9:12 Y is wide open
Sooner than later we won't be able to tell this is a video game. Graphics look so real.
I just got the Xbox series x and none of the gameplay is there the play calling screen everything does anybody know how to fix that
Is the game as fun as you make it sound?
I want one where me and my teammates are actual people. And we can actually be the football player
how do you get the momentum I never get them
Why doesn’t my madden 22 have the bar above scoreboard?
I hate this game already.
you wanted them to win
If anybody has madden 2022 I have a 5850 madden points card that I i’m selling just reply to this message if you’re interested
He did the bears bogus throwing that game 😤😅
I'm a Packers fan and this was a fun game...The Bears still suck
It sucks because I don’t have my ps5 yet and I’m not buying this game til I get it! But I love this channel
So Metcalf scores  A TD and the crown acts as if the away team scored..No response, No reaction from the crowd at all
This just sad… I’ll pass! Respectfully 🤞🏽🤣
You didn't hit that throw soon enough before the half don't blame Fields 😂
Whoever used Justin fields sold 😩
im waiting to buy it tomorrow
Eh.....still not buying it
Am i the only one that plays franchise mode with  cpu vs cpu, putting my team management skills to the test??🤔🤔
it must be nice to be able to get a ps5
Can’t wait to to play as Dallas Cowboys on this look very good this year
For the record....first play I throw to "B"....ha ha
What offense are yall running with the bears
looks good, but there  was two plays where he took way to long to throw the ball.
They gave gunslinger to kyler Murray ❓❓❓❓
Personally, I really feel like this game is created to piss you off. They don’t care about satisfying the customer clearly. They just want you to get pissed off because they know that will keep you coming back. If they made this game realistic, they know that real football players who actually understand football would smack everyone and others would quit. I understand what they are doing but at the same time it’s going to lose them a multi million dollar game. So good luck with that EA
This game is sad, very sad
Corners still pick passes 10 yards under the ball that’s thrown, they still glitch to the ball on a deep throw, and 5’9 corners are snagging on 6’5 receivers
Quarterback still has to take 10 seconds to get to the line and snap the ball regardless of how much time is on the clock. They do it on purpose to give the defense time to change the play which I think is dumb because the whole point of going on the ball is either because of time management or to confuse the defense to score
your parents must be so proud.
So what’s the verdict? Good or naw
NO Refs..c'mon man
Is it on the easiest setting everyone is wide open lol
Does it do this stuff on current gen also?! If so I’m so down for this
I just thought next gen would be crazy. Was all this damn money I spent worth it…. Hell no
Wouldn’t the squiggly lines matter more if it actually affected WRs route running? I haven’t played NCAA Football in years so I don’t remember that being a thing in any game. Anyways..that would be crazy if it actually mattered. Also as players we already see the play art before confirming the play so it is really that crucial if that momentum factor or whatever was being used against us by the CPU?
They crowd is dead 💀 there barely moving wtf this is why I’m still playing ncaa 14 and ncaa 10 on ps3 this is pathetic
What’s makes you so sure this is the first game play
Qb runs kill you in man coverage. They'll have to tune that so it doesn't become too cheesy
This guy back drops too much. Very childish.
The waves remind me of NCAA Now that kids benefit off their names are they going to make NCAA games again?
how could you even recommend this game when one of the main features isn't going to available for 60% of people such bullshit they didn't add dynamic gameplay for PS4/Xbox.
3:14 I hate when people do this bs. no where in the NFL would any team go for it in this situation. It’s so unrealistic and extremely annoying when someone converts because it would’ve never happened in real life
can we please fix HB screen blocking, I'm tired of my linemen just winking at the defenders and letting them pummel my hb when I have a huge lane if I get a block
Game play looks dope
Madden should make it hard to get first downs on 4th downs!
I wish madden was like 2k playing this back tackle in all on the park in sh!t
This game fuckin sucks. Its the same damn game
Is it just me or should mahomes have gun slinger infact they might as well give him every throwing ability
Horrible timeout management before half lol
Is the current or next gen
Surprise surprise the same old trash Madden
Dude u really sold madden22 with this one i love ya commentary AMAZIN !
Home field advantage the games “newest” feature was something recycled from NCAA Football 07 🤦🏾‍♂️
Oh my good this game made me hype for college football 22
the wiggly lines we always cool in ncaa and felt legit for RP purposes, but lets be honest, they never actually made playing offense any harder. A pretty underwhelming home field advantage for one of, if not the best home fields in the league.
6:44 they still haven’t fixed the offensive fumble recoveries when the player is not downed, same b.s. Madden money grabbers.
Even the crowd is better this is amazing
madden showing crowd cut scenes.. took them only 16 years to do something we had in 2k5.. and the NCAA home field advantage effect is back lol
Madden still 🗑 after all these year's
In real life fields is a running quarterback and he will be a bust in a few years.
How are u playin it now if it does coe out tell the 20th an the earliestyo can play is on the 18th EricRayweather
He holds the ball so long with recievers wide open its giving me anxiety.
2:16 Watch how Khalil Mack absolutely DESTROYS that RT. Loved that animation!
Looks like the same old garbage
so many missed touchdowns
whats justins speed
Here we go again with some stupid BS from EA/Madden! I don’t need a field that shakes like an earthquake to max a setting or squiggly lines for passing the football. Franchise players want a game that feel and looks like a real NFL game and a real NFL season. This means a Hall of Fame game to start the pre-season. This means making sure all pre-season and regular season games are included.  And that playoffs including the Wildcard Playoffs, Divisional Playoffs, Conference Championship Games, AFC vs NFC Pro Bowl Game with authentic NFL team helmets and a Super Bowl Game are a included in a season. Instead of wasting memory space on squiggly lines how about fixing the Referees to part of the on field screen and adding cheerleaders and mascots along with a sideline reporter and a meaningful halftime recap and weekly recap show to make users feel like their really apart of a NFL season. In short incorporate the best parts of Madden 05, Madden 06 and Madden 12 to make a great franchise users game.
The Texas route once again looks cheesy and unstoppable
Miller got traded
Justin fields or cam Newton?
Does moment work in the franchise mode?
This is a remastered ncaa 14
7:35 rb wide open
Bro u threw to x way goo late
Madden is still trash, unlike madden lets be realistic
Physics looks so much better. But I don’t know if I can trust EA and justify buying another game. We’ll just have to see.
Why would I buy a game that’s jus going to be free in 3 months no thx EA😂😂
If this isn't on rookie it looks like the DBs are still dumb
was this next gen?
Is this on psp4 or psp5 ERICRAYWEATHER?
7:36 R1 was open for the TD 😭
I swear to good this looks the same..
I loved it.. And im a Cowboys fan. Nice video
Lol I bet over half yal got madden preordered
Great Madden 22 vid....🔥🔥🔥
You were late on the x Receiver bears win
Better visuals but gameplay is still TRASH
They crowd goes crazy  The Crowd:😐
Must of been a Seahawks fan 😂
USE THE 49ERS PLEASE
7:35 you missed RB :(
“See that no one pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to each other and to all people.” ‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5:15‬ ‭NLT‬‬
Look like same thing
The cut scenes look like  NFL2k5
this play by play is pretty good.
Any of you guys on PC?
Does anyone else notice that when a player gets knocked down to the ground there roughly about 3 yards tall? Which will put them at roughly about 9 foot tall? Lions left tackle Taylor Decker is 6 ft 8 in tall so he is roughly a little taller than 2 yards yet hein Russell Westbrook went to the ground he was roughly 3 yards tall!..... the Madden gaming franchises a joke!
Hold the phone! So what you're telling me is that Matthew Stafford is not a gunslinger? His whole career he has been known as the Gunslinger! Madden is a goddamn joke
“But HOLD THE PHONE!” 😯😂😂😂
As someone who hasn’t bought the game since madden 13, would 22 be worth it?
Not sure if the video was sped up or what the game level is, but it feels a bit arcadey with how QB's are just taking off for 50 yard runs so easily
imma be honest, the game presentation actually looks really good. my biggest negative is that AWFUL juke move, like what are you guys doing!?!?
Was this on all madden
Same as madden 20
This guy sounds miserable playing this.  Play something you enjoy lol
Playing the beta and I feel like you lied to all of us by saying that they had more changes this year than in recent years. It's madden 21.2
wow the replays are SO MUCH BETTER NOW, i may not skip each cut scene this year
Sooo in other words and sight it's the same game. Including noody really cares new features.
I see momentum doesn't account for llays that keep a team in the game or even when plays happen. So Its just a generic bar that moves pretty much in accordance with TDs and TOs. Also it looks too similar to madden 21 animations/art to make me excited, but ill see how it plays later. Just really wish EA would redo madden from the ground up literally.
60fps cut scenes here. A shame the Xbox Series S still has 30fps cutscenes & replays (just played the trial).
Can you show some video on the Xbox one version? I haven’t gotten the chance to get next gen yet and I’m wondering if it’s worth the purchase.
Do MLBs actually animate for interceptions bc if so I’ll literally buy they game this year if so.
It looks bad as always. Unfortunately! They never learn..never
Can we get some Current Gen gameplay next?
Literally the same as last year...
This looks the same as Madden 21, which looked the same as Madden 20, which looked the same as Madden 19, which looked the same as Madden 18
That wavy playart looks useless, you could still tell what routes they are.
on madden 13 the squigly lines happened no matter what
glad to see the QB scramble at least what I saw so far doesn't make them have a speed of a turtle once they cross the line of scrimmage
This is literally a copy and paste with minor additions. EA must be stopped! #boycottEA   Side note: They should have the screen shake on Offense/Defense the entire play when momentum is high. Kinda wack that it stops as soon as they hike the ball. Also if the player isn't know for being clutch, his attributes should go down during these times i.e (sweaty palms)
So players still can’t scoop and score? Wtf..
wow the replays are SO MUCH BETTER NOW, i may not skip each cut scene this year
I see a lot people saying the game looks the same as last year. I'm fine with that. EA's problem has been adding to many new features every year and for getting about the exactly gameplay. I want them to start focusing on how the game plays vs how it looks. I want more realistic gameplay and better CPU AI
wow this literally looks the exact same as 2020 and 2021...hard pass gonna wait and get what 2k makes if that ever comes out
Defense suck
Field goal for the tie? Go for the win...geez.
What game difficulty are you on? Defense looks invisible again this year.
What would be cool is if all this special ability stuff was hidden and behind the scenes, no overlays showing the stuff and no explanations. Just let it play out behind the scenes
Is this next gen?
Game trash n still the same, sad
For me it's the same as the previous Madden. Won't buy this year. Still on Madden 21
Not a single negative thing was said in this video. Coverages are still absolutely terrible, lineman still can’t block even on double teams and your answer to one of the worst plays I’ve seen happen so far is “idk how this happened” wow 🤨
They brought back the gunshot sound on long passes. Ugh.  No refs. Ugh.  They copied the squiggly lines from NCAA. Not bad.  Overall: meh. Again.
Might have to stop buying madden it’s literally just a updated roster smh
Alright this game is fake ain’t no way Jamal Adam’s is catching a interception
Lol defense didn’t even stand a chance lmao 😂
Heart sank. Meta looks about the same. Crossing routes are going to still get pretty wide open. QBs can still escape the pocket pretty easy. Not looking great
come on bears! fall apart! giants want that #1 pick
Stutter start and stops things playing out at random animation speeds lack of any physics just random Animation triggers completely takes away semblance of control. Ratings don’t matter. Feels like this generic thing. Soulless. How predictably dissapointing
Yessir#GOHAWKS
As a kid growing up playing tecmo bowl I would have never dreamed games would be this incredible.
The video was watched by many people in a short time. 1 like from me. How did you get to this level? What can I do to get more people to see my video?
This does not look next gen at all!
Football is so boring now. Just run it with the QB or bomb it
how’s it looking on current gen anyone know?
No way! Eric the goat on trending! #23!
It's been like 8 years that I stopped buying this game and I still is the same crap just different menu, I use to love dynasty mode, but now they only care about microtransactions which completely suck, in the 90's at least we could have in our hands our sports card deck, now you can even touch the cards that you buy! What a stupid way to spend money. I hate what they have done to this game.
I wish you could do the commentary Eric. Madden needs to hit you up.
It took EA 30 Years to bring realistic crowd noise which NFL 2K mastered In 5 years of its short existence WoW
Imagine the people who got next gen just to play this 😂
What a bad game it’s still looks like crap
I don’t see why everyone was freaking out about the squiggly line play art. I can still see exactly what routes are being ran. Maybe I’m just use to it from the NCAA days.
Love your content!! Stay safe everyone ❤️ ❤️
Anyone else notice that nearly every sack comes from a defender splitting a double team block? The same thing as past two maddens, wtf
Honestly I think they should just do away with ability to look at your routes/runs after you pick your plays. make it a little more difficult
Looks trash wont be buying
Congrats Eric! At the time of this comment, this video is number 21 on trending!  :D
The only thing I wish they would fix is the amount of pressure and sacks that are happening off double teams. Disappointed to see that still as well the WR and DB just standing still not moving with no football logic once they’ve run their routes. Not attempting to help the Qb and get open like IRL! Other then that I’m exicted for madden 22
No lie…this is the most improvement over one year that they have given us in a long time. And I am usually a pretty stiff critic of Madden. This was pretty nice!
I feel like the momentum thing has always been in. The game they just put a bar on the hud
It looks the same every animations the same wtf
No referees nowhere on the game
this is next-gen ps5?!?
Have they fixed the crowd noise in madden 22? I swear, in ‘21 I would throw a 50 yard completion down field for a touchdown and the home crowd would just be silent. Totally kills the immersion of the game.
Eric, do you work for Ea now? What in the world was this video about?
I gotta admit this is a step forward
Lmaooooooooooooooooooooo... Aye Eric I appreciate you trying to make it seem a lot better than what it is.
I hope these replay angles are on pc it’s only like 5x the amount of a next gen console 😂😂
The Oline still not properly blocking, more recycled animations,  the sideline players still look like garbage... "The screen shakes now!" Woah What a new feature...  And EA doesn't give af because people will still buy this bs since  it's the only option on the market. Really wanted a new "next Gen" experience.
Bout time they let you set the length for bears socks
Typical madden dropping easy catches
Is this current or next gen?
I’ve seen nothing new in gameplay with this game honestly. I’m a huge Madden fan but come on now!
K murry will be the best way at to use
Jamal Adams interception? Yea no
1:52 love to see the difference from madden 21 that players don’t go through each other
So will this be on current Gen or just the new one?
I won't be able to afford Madden 22 this year
The ball angles on passes is so much better
Is this on ps5?
Wow when I was a kid I buy Madden every year it came out I just realized I haven't played in almost 10 years and it looks so different and hard I don't even know if I could play it anymore looks very cool though about time that they put momentum meters and Gunslinger type of s*** and made it different from all the rest
I swear I don’t see a difference
Db coverage looks the same. Not good.
I’m sorry but the animations and running movement are still trash. Man I wish 2K could make a football game.
Impressive 🔥🔥🔥
Why was Anthony Miller on the bears he got traded to the Texans
Missed a wide open touchdown at 7:35 to RB.
We desperately need a new tv license and new commentators
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Damn same game
They haven’t updated that Anthony Miller got traded
Looks good
It’s too easy to get slant routes on this game still. Top defenses don’t play like top defenses when it comes to coverage and pressure.
The fans😂😂😂
Game is so unrealistic, Jamal Adams got a pick at 4:26 🙄
Looks good and I see they improved the speed with the running it’s not 100 percent but it looks a lot better than madden 21 next gen
Bruh had a good vid till that BS catch by mooney
You gained a subscriber just off the commentary no 🧢
This is the best that Madden has looked in years! No more skipping cut scenes for me. Thanks for doing what you do.
How does it play?  Moody said it’s the same gameplay.  Hoping he is wrong.
I'm actually excited to get a Madden I'm not super excited but I have alot more positive feeling twords Madden 22
We all know madden has issues but i see alot of improvement. Its a lot of the same animations but i also see plenty new animations. This madden could be the best madden in awhile. Im kinda excited. Not hyped but a little excited
Is momentum in ultimate team to?
Why are the graphics worse than Madden 2019
6:49 twins out here at the game together. 😂
If someone posted this and didn't put madden 22 in the title you would have never thought it was new. This looks IDENTICAL to last year and years prior. All they add is small things like home field advantage and different x factors for players? Lol who cares. Fix and change the game play for once
Plz to Jets V Jags, rookie vs rookie
can you dive in madden 22?
This was a very exciting video! Mooney should've caught that game tying ball had the pass been thrown slightly earlier. I was yelling at the screen "throw it he's open" LOL
Since they use the ncaa idea of the whole momentum gauge that fumble should have swung it a lot more especially considering it led to a score right after
Not even close to simulation football
Eric beautifully advertising the game he actively criticizes 🤣
hey eric, will you do a video with the browns?
Same graphic design as always
This is literally the same game from last year and the year before 😂🤦‍♂️
Nice Seahawks
Is this ps4/ Xbox one or ps5/ Xbox one x gameplay
AMO is the greatest connected franchise ever
I see the dline still only contain on run plays and still stuck like glue
I wish there was an attribute for QBs that was called ball placement. The interception thrown before the half, there was so much space on the right and he threw it right where the safety was. Even if the route was a streak and not a fade, in actuality, a QB would know where to throw that ball. Madden kills me, I know things can't be perfect but do better. It looks exactly the same, they just sped up some things. Another thing, make awareness mean something, on that fumble recovery, who in their right mind would just step out of bounds after recovering the ball. And no his momentum should not have carried him out, he wasn't moving that fast. It really sucks because I love football but I just can't do this with madden anymore ✌🏽
Finally FOOTBALL IS BACK!!!
Same game…
I can still see the routes no matter how wiggly they are. 😂 #madden20
So is madden 10 trail available today or only on next gen
So unrealistic there are fans in the stadium
The tackling looks trash. Hopefully the tackling gets better.
This was the biggest commercial ever
I'm assuming EA asked all of these Game Changers to not include the regular commentary and audio because it's so bad lol
This hardly moves the needle for me. Can't believe gameplay has been withheld for so long.
I love the commentary mate. 🔥🔥🔥
Are you using series X or S?
Sooo madden21
Not trying to be a troll hater. The player animations and tackle animations are exactly the same from what I can tell.   So momentum and "team perks" are new.
Pass coverage is so weak
Eric throwing straight dots lol
Omg.....it’s  accurate like real life
"Look at the crowd..SALTY" 🤣
Escape artist will b overpowered 🤦🏽‍♂️
There goes my drinking and madden games. Not with the screen shaking and the play art looking like that
Correct me if I’m wrong but it looks like even if the routes are shaking the wr still runs the right route unlike the old ncaa games correct?
looks like the outs and check downs are still king.
Omg the commentary was awesome.  Bro u r hilarious
Why is Anthony Miller on the bears still?
As someone that hasn't played Madden since 12, this is alot. But I like it. I may have to check it out
In Madden 21, I Hated the glitch where I would find my receiver, throw the ball, go for a catch and run. And the game would glitch and my receiver would not even try to go for the ball.  I really hope they fixed that in Madden 22
Comment 1,000 🔥
😔
You missed so much opened people😭
No defense. The DBacks just sit there. They don't even turn hips and run with streak routes till the ball is mid air. Looks like screens and out routes and HB angle routes are going to be all you need cuz LBs and CBs don't respond to any of it.
Looks like drags and RB outs will be open consistently
Could you do the patriots next with Mac Jones
Someone get flight to react to this
Can you be on actual madden cometary team
Buy the or game or you don’t it’s simple 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
This game looks so good!
The game play is the same come on EA you need to start from scratch
Dude this was a great video
There is some new tackle animations
This is still trash as far as the routes being “scrambled”. They should’ve made it more unreadable because I can still see the damn routes. On top of that add the receivers being more susceptible of being confused or even better, make the O line jump just like real life. That stadium is known for miscommunication and false starts.
What I noticed immediately is that QBs can STILL run outta the pocket completely unbothered and have all day to pass or run. EA swore they fixed contains and the pass rush tho, right? This ganns is about to be nothin more than a title update smh
That's my quarterback
If I had a dollar for every-time he said” the crowd is going crazy” I could retire
WE WANT MORE!!! So good! Can’t wait to buy the game
Hey… at least it looks better than 21.
I’m glad I preordered
It’s cool and all but the graphics look the same and I saw the same animations from 21 sooo
Just imagine what the elite will be able to do  ...... WITH ABILITIES  smh ..... P.S.im still gonna buy the game though lol #maddenhead
Lol madden is still madden SMH .. THAT SIDELINE CATCH by #11 is ridiculous,  not only did he catch the ball over his own teammate but he also caught it over like 2 other defenders who were all in front of him, somehow managed to catch the ball blindly keep BOTH feet in when nobody else was able to stay in bounds lol even he did aggressive catch there shouldn't have been no catch......we also have a ROOKIE making throws like that against Seattle like wah??🤔
ERIC THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST MADDEN SO FAR MANNNN! I seen a lot of different animations tackles catches defense playing there right zone JUST A LOT OFF DIFFERENTS
*Says something positive about Madden* “You’re the reason Madden sucks” But y’all want them to add refs and the pro bowl 😭
Looks good this year.... think this the best year yet
Gameplay looks better then last years game, imo
Is this PS5 or 4 ? ..
Anyone else notice the more realistic throw under pressure animations
Idk how I feel bout the squiggly lines becuz u can still see the route they should make it to were u can't see nothing or make the route line different e erytime u pull it up and u have to guess what routs u are doing
I rather watch this with Eric commentary instead of playing it lmfao
Great commentary
Gameplay speed looks faster
Talk about the run game and defense user
SO YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ALL THIS TIME! AMAZING COMMENTARY HAD ME TUNED IN. MORE OF THESE
As a Seahawks fan Chris Carson selling is not a surprise lmaooo
Madden still wack
Russ a lil bit too fast on here lmao that’s going to be tough to stop
So corner routes are still overpowered
WEAK ASL SMDH!
Its the same game no change at all
Everybody taking down on madden gon be main ones buying it n playing it and they excuse gon be “ I had no other games to play “ yea ite
9:35 i just cant believe he got his feet in
Looks like 21
I can’t wait until they actually make stiff arms work. The throwing motions look good as well.
7:35 RB wide open 🤦🏾‍♂️
1:20-1:25 wow, head glitch😂 smh ea
So how come Fields was throwing off his back foot almost every time??
Definitely not worth the money
Expecting more from a next gen.
I know it’s the popular thing to hate on everything Madden, but this looked pretty damn good. Even the Qb drop backs look better
Still don’t see a ref lol
This looks soo good. 👀
Does that mean Ice the kicker will be effective
Look at the fans... salty Idk why that was too funny for me🤣
Looks like I’m getting an Xbox so I can revisit the prime years of madden 04-08
But the Qb still always fumble so you can’t run with the qb
I preordered the mvp edition so I can get it for the series x whenever I can be fast enough to get one
Nun really looks different 😕🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
focused on everything but how the players look and move ?? but I will say you made it entertaining
This is simulation Football 😵🤬
Have they fixed CPU players just running out of bounds for no reason? Biggest issue in the game by far
Is this Madden 21?
Pass, another year of EA failing at football gaming to me.
Eric, you really had to mention double doink 😒
this game is the one boys
Why wouldn't you be the home team
Bro you was sellin the bears 🤦🏽‍♂️
The crowd didn't move on that TD.
Awesome play-by-play brother!
I like how your playing both teams commentating like your not. Making my bears look bad with late reactions and choosing bad plays
Kyler Murray with gunslinger it might just be over for yall
7:33 RB is wide open
better commentator than brandin gauden and charles davis
A year later Better graphics ,better replays = madden 22🤦‍♂️
Sounds like you love next gen hell yeah after downing next gen hell yeah
The game def looks a lot smoother…..This is X Box Series X??? I’m so pissed the PC version isn’t next gen????? Like how the Phuck is that the case???? It would literally be an X Box series X Port!!!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
this looks good just wish I could get my hands on a PS5
Looks like the Same game to me
Damn they coulda at least added a different scoreboard,  this look too much like madden 21
I'm gonna pass on this one. Another year of bums getting wins because of superstar abilities. Make people earn a win.
YOU CAN STILL SEE INVISIBLE WALLS. The first try russ threw. Come on madden.
You’re one hell of a commentator
Running back at 7:35 :(
I actually might buy this now
Eric when I tell you had a touchdown and so many receivers open 🤦🏾‍♂️
I'd buy it for $30, $60 was ridiculous and $70 is just insane
This was by far your best video. That's saying a lot because you have great content. I'm so hyped for 22, so that's probably why this video was great.
Anthony Miller???
Forget what y’all talking about did they fix the commentators they annoying asf and they be hurting me not go lie😂
Anthony Miller isn’t a Bear anymore
So pathetic it looks Exactly like 21. Madden is trash bring back 2k
The spacing on the field looks incredible
I almost never say anything positive abt madden but this looks way better than I expected
Too bad like 4 fun features they added will only be on next gen and not even on PC
QB Rattled?... Just run drag routes all day haha
What console is this on? Because it looks exactly the same I’m mind blown by this
Same game 🙄
Players on the sideline looking pretty real 😂
EA doesn't gives af about this game anymore it still looks and plays terrible and is the same thing for the last 10 years. Thankfully haven't bought this in years.
That’s cool y’all Madden fans are proud of this
Wish you could play offense for both teams in franchise and control all 32 teams
🤔 same game regardless of his enthusiasm
SoFi when Fields go crazy
Wow. Game  looks exactly the same as last year.
2:52 glad to see you can still hitstick with no momentum…
Russ got gunslinger . Nothing else to say about my h2h squad 😭🗣
Ngl he fr just sold when he was on the bears
That bears forced fumble in the 4th should have made more of an impact to the crowd/meter. It barely moved for them
They need to update the roster since we traded Anthony Miller to the Texans
Eric you gotta have some better stick work with Justin fields he too nice to be playing decent lol good game
Maaan I can’t lie to myself anymore this might be the 1st year I don’t get madden when you really look at the gameplay you can see it’s goin to be the same game as last year
will the scouting be on current gen?
I really like the momentum shift stuff, gameplay still doesn't look impressive tho
Overall the atmosphere looks improved. Crowd and sideline are more individualized. Player movements with speed and next gen movement seem to be at a good balance too.   Still not worth a $60 purchase but I'm liking the way its going
I really hope it’s still at least halfway like this on current gen I don’t trust EA they are gonna make it exactly like 21 ik it man
Legit the same game with a few changes
This is gonna be bad for ppl that get blown out
Still none of the stuff is for pc or older console 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
0:46 you had your Tight End for an open TD😂if not a td more yardage than what u got
Game looks awesome can't wait
Was this the newest systems version if so which one?
wait how is he playing this
where the refs at?
Madden 19 running mechanics🤦🏽‍♂️
I’m pretty sure they haven’t changed anything on current gen
I remember when they had the squiggly line concept in NCAA 14
Dude can you please talk about how the game feels more than commentating your own game? I feel that you are doing us a disservice by not taking about gameplay and presentation.
2:29 the crowd was just standing there
Does anyone know for the next gen version is the gameplay like madden 21 next gen version or last gen? I didn’t like how they changed the gameplay for madden 21 next gen
Does challenge plays work on here?
Heck put eric at commentary in madden he did good enough 😂
Looks like the exact same game as 21
Maybe Eric should become the new official commentator for Madden. 🤔 That was so much fun to watch and listen.
I’d rather listen to Eric on commentary than the ones in the game.
So they changed the catching? So can you not choose a aggressive catch? Or run after the catch? I saw TD Barrett had a pick but he didnt pick it? So I was seeing if you cant swat or it does it automatically for you.
The real question is… did they add the Griddy?
Same Bs game again smh
Was this next gen?
Peep 7:24 , the AI player on the side line helps up this teammate 👀
Wow the game looks good. Too bad it doesn’t matter cause I’m on PC. Hate madden
02:18 DK scores TD, crowd’s just standing there doing nothing lol
I sure hope that Madden updates team rosters bc I noticed that Anthony Miller is still with the Bears.
You know it’s madden when jamal adams comes down with a pick.
For someone who only plays Madden and 2k next gen really isn't worth it smh I thought there would be more of a difference but damn
The game looks good because whoever was playing knew what they were doing and had football iq
Seriously?  Slants are still open after all this time.  Crossing routes should be better covered by now
It looks just like 21
I see receivers still don’t block downfield just peep DK METCALF at 1:51 smh same old bs
Is this next gen?
that toss to D’Wayne Eskridge would’ve been that stupid vacuum two-man animation last year. love to see that change!
Lol this is not what the game actually looks like in madden 22. That score board not right to. That’s 21 madden.
Okay,,, it's a start..... so let's to continue to get updates thru out the season to add stuff.......not have to wait for 23 for changes
That looks good for madden the content
Can you PLEASE see if Urban Meyer is in the game 😭😭
What can tern Russ into danger russ
Ok, imma get a headache with the Seahawks screenshake
Is this on next gen?
man the player models still look crappy lol
😂 I’d pay moeny to see Eric commentate an nfl game I was not bored a single play
How good is Justin Fields release
I hope one year everyone stops buying madden and when the madden creator sees less people buy the game then he could add a whole bunch of those old fun game modes back into the game and actually  gives is want we want and hopefully add the football version of neighborhood like 2k lol😂
Eric was litteraly a kid in the candy shop just jumping up and down😂
Good video. Why EA make u wait so long I’m going to be able to play in 2 days
I liked the vid but don’t like how you disrespected Justin fields by posting a vid of him losing ;( not the energy I need right before the season starts
Idk why everyone keeps complaining, I understand madden hasn't been very good past couple years or so, but this madden 22 doesn't look that bad tbh. I see they might have fix the glitches which was a BIG THING I think.....but anyway by this video look pretty decent so far
Looks like the same exact game. Again….
so exited for madden to look like this again, im happy they brought back 21s, 20s, and 19s graphics
It’s literally the same game with a little add on. Im sick of the same tackle animations all the damn time. You think alll of this is 60 dollars? No shot.
Not gon lie I’m excited to play madden 22 hopefully it’s as good as it looks
I pre ordered it and i don't have it
I wonder what it's going to look like on the ps4 and xbox one
We know this is madden bc Jamal Adams got an int
This is Madden 21 plus. Disappointing. Fix the zone coverages. Make receivers jump for the ball in two-man situations. Absolute garbage.
still looks like last year's Madden.
same thing every year
I swear Eric needs to be a commentator
The animation looks smoother than 21.
They still don’t run the screen right lol
must be nice to have a next-gen system.
Wow madden looks different  Sees Darnell Mooney moss 5 Seahawks   ok nothing changed
Wow! The commentary was a million times better than espn's mnf in real life! U should do live streams of real nfl games. Like recap highlight videos. U had me into that game!
Better… but still not even close to worth 60
Overall looks good receivers not blocking downfield is a problem for me
EricRayweather I love your content but I’ll smoke you in madden…. Wit the bears😄✌🏿
2:30 "Brings the crowd to life.." You can see the crowd being loud but stand there motionless and clueless. LMFAO. Way to go EA. 🤣🤣
It looks better
Make a gameplay vid on current gen plzz
Is enforcer good
I’m so god damn sick of the animations running this game. Remember when it was just straight up football? This looks like a game for a 5 year old arcade game
A shame they still have that bummy slide animation
Is it me, or is it way too easy to get the momentum in your favor? 1 TD lead and the home team has completely filled the M factor? Seems unrealistic.
Looks great I am going to wait till Christmas to get it cause it will be less money get some new announcers then I would be more happier
1:49 good blocking
Too bad I can’t enjoy most of this
What’s going on with that secondary 2:36 🧐
You wanted Seattle to win this game 😡
Hey Eric, love the content. I wanted to ask if it’s possible you can show some current gen (PS4,XONE) gameplay??
Camera guys on the sidelines kill the immersion. Too stiff! No refs… cmon man! Why did I work so hard to get a new Xbox.
And also it's next gen but those camera man still look like posters smh they even imitate posters by not moving smh
Put Eric in the skybox for commentating this year
But the play art is still easily visible tho lol thats my thing lol
$70 for Madden 21.5. Man I'll probably end up buying it just because there's literally no other options. I saw maybe one new animation and yeah the game looks make a bit smoother but overall you're either lying to yourself or absolutely delusional if you say this is any kind of massive upgrade from last year. I do believe If they weren't contractually obligated to drop a game every year they could take time and build a proper product from the ground up. I have high hopes for the new College football game because they have time to put it together now if that's trash there are no excuses
Is this for ps4
2:26 “you can hear the crowd go crazy” as no one in the crowd looks mobile or even alive LMAO
This looks terrible.  It’s so choppy.  EA gets away with it another year.  I won’t be purchasing for a 4th straight year. Enjoy the game
One thing I notice that defensive tackle gonna be important
Still the same commentary tho
Why they do my boy Justin like that
Why it looks like mobile EA with better graphics
Madden has finally made a better game. I can't wait for this to drop
Unrealistic, Jamal Adams got an interception
Can’t play Madden again until they COMPLETELY eliminate Badges/X-Factor abilities in single player modes. Players should perform as they are rated without needed any stupid arcade fighting game style extras
Am I hearing a random snap count from Russel wilson?! What happened to his normal voice….
Is this next gen?
That was cool. Great video man. Do one with my Vikings please
Looks just like madden 21. And I see you still can’t guard sideline routes and corners in the end zone even though the coverage is in those areas. Great….   I ain’t buying this trash.
@ 7:35 Right (RB) Bumper was wide open
Games look alot smoother but didn't fix the zone coverage so people will run the same offense as 21 an it will work. Trips te or gun bunch or trips offset
Seems like way too many arcade elements for a simulation football game. Another 1 step forward graphically, 2 steps back for gameplay. EA sports it was in the game.
Yo anyone know if I will get the dynasty preorder stuff. I brought the mvp first but then I seen the discount for the dynasty and brought that
The GAME STILL SUCKS....
Pathetic
I just hate how WRs consistently get thrown off routes by garbage CBs, even on a streak the WR will end up running to the sideline before cutting back up the field.
Dude if youve played enough madden you can still see every route lol they should flipped em
Is the crowd louder when the bar get maxed for home fields?
It looks good on next gen
Look how slow they run 🤣🤣🤣🤣 tf
Are these features only in the next generation model games or both?
it looks alright
Super curious on OL play
Same old madden…. Wow the screen shakes….😒😒😒
Wow home field advantage really makes a difference holy hell
hey man i have a ps4 can u capture some game play on a ps4 please?
Man coverage looks awful
The commentary is straight fire 🔥
I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED FOR THIS!!!!!!
Fuxkin contains are still the same. It’s the same damn game with the QB’s running outside the pocket and throwing.
Justin fields should start week 1 no benefits no debate 🤦🏾‍♂️💯
Still no refs on the field
I stopped midway turned off by the commentating
Not enough changes for me to buy. Hopefully 2k comes out swinging next year so madden can finally have some incentive to make the game better.
Not realistic. Darnell Mooney would’ve caught that touchdown
The game looks a lot better this year I'm so excited
Hopefully momentum and the physics of the gameplay is for the PS4 too
Looks like the same old Madden to me. What a disappointment 😒
I can see the roll out bums now , running out the pocket and throwing deep crossers
Dang this is my first time hearing him be hype
This was an awesome video bro, well done 👏🏽
Gameplay look much smoother
Can you show what it’ll be like on PS4 or Xbox one
Optimism is high and my syndrome is down
lol this really how madden be too lmao.
That was great commentary. Got me hyped for Madden 22. 1st time in a long time
Are the replays for PS4 also it makes no sense to give one console stuff and then leave out the other ones
The game actually looks good
I feel this momentum would have been really efficient if it was legion of boom defense.
It looks just like Madden 21
Let Eric be one of the Madden commentators!
This was a banger it's true.
Gameplay looks 99% similar to last year. I just hope my players catch the balls and don’t get stuck in broken animations I guess. I also wish defenders would put their hands in between the pass to strip the ball out, rather than having receivers drop the balls just because a defender is standing there. Also the screen plays are still poorly executed. The HB outruns the line and they don’t block anyone in front of them.
love it love it love it. Better commentary then the game. Keep doing your thang
I agree that Madden doesn’t change much from year to year. But I’m all honesty, if you don’t like it don’t buy it. Complaining about referees not being on the field is ridiculous. You want a more realistic experience? Go outside and play football. It’s a video game people.
I can still figure out all the routes. They are moving really slow so I was able to figure out all the routes.
You sold on my 🐻 s
Love the presentation of the video. Totally got me excited. The most unrealistic thing was Jamal Adams playing good coverage in Cover 2. LOL
People are just trying to find stuff to get mad about 💀
I hope the crowd will actually look hyped not just sound hyped, I didn't like when they'd cheer but their animation would look like the game was in between plays
@7:34 missed touchdown
EA ACCESS IS OPEN?
“You can hear the crowd going crazy!” The crowd: 😐
HEY 👋 ERIC MOMMY LOVES 💘 YOUR VOICE ‼️
I thought Trey Lance was the QB with 90 speed
When is madden 22 mobile is coming out this week or the next week on Madden 22 on the switch please this year or the next year please
@7:36 in the video you had a nice run but had a seen route wide open for a touchdown right before the 2 minute warning
They should add chearleaders on the sidelines and should make the cameramen look better
crossing routes and foot.taps on the sideline by anyone smh
The crowd still seems out of sync
Play with Denver bro !
“DONT ASK ME HOW HE CAUGHT IT”😂😂
Ohio state best quarter back in draft
Crowd closeups look like PS2 NPCs
Mack didn’t make a play 😒
man that play art is not tough to read. it'd be better if it didnt show up at all
Russ is about to be the most overused player again this year.
Hold up don't you pick the play? How you don't know the Routes of the play you chose?
These same plays, 1 defender can guard the whole field
Which version is this next gen or last gen ?
4:00 nice gamethrowing.
Looks the same gn
I'm cautiously optimistic
Watching this I might actually  buy it
I couldn’t still see the play art fine lol
At least the camera cuts during the next gen stats aren’t so choppy and quick anymore
This thumbnail really do be how people run routes in this game when they bump into defenders
Either you suck or you just trying to make J Fields look bad for reason
I just want the screen to shake when there’s a big play
kyler murray got gunslinger? oh yea i been playing with them all 21 and when jj watt went over there i said i was gonna play with cards and this just helps my case😂
Gameplay looking clean and the commentary made it better love madden season
Throwing animations look better
Looks the same smh
Epic video
I thought madden had a espn broadcast this year i seen espn on the scoreboard in other videos
I think it was ncaa 2005 I know it was the one with larry Fitzgerald on the cover but the home field advantage is nothing new! The gameplay looks the same as 20 and if it was good that wouldn't matter but this the same thing. This the first year 04 im not going to buy madden. Screen shaking huh 😏 come on EA we've seen everything on that field before
I love a lot of the Madden content creators. For their sake I hope this game is good.
It’s not perfect but this is the best it’s been in a while a step forward please don’t move back EA
the bouncing routes are really useless, you can still tell the routes. they should’ve did it to where it shows a route but they run a whole different one from the one shown
Same car new paint!
That's my guy Justin Fields.
Jamal Adams with a pick, let's be realistic
we wanted to see trevor lawrence
Y’all think Eric like to throw to the rb!?
2:26 "You can hear the crowd going crazy." - Eric  Crowd in the background: 0_0
Y is the names keep popping up  Over there hits  When they catch the ball they need to get  Rid of that
I feel like they might gotta turn the shaking routes off for people who have seizures 😬😬😬😂 making my head hurt a lil
Definitely keep doing these videos I litterally stop what I'm doing just to watch these videos when you upload and got so hype when it was game play...I always said Eric makes the world a better place!!
Ncaa had this like 7 years ago lol I'm glad crowd noise helps like that but just another thing that should've been there for years
I see they still haven’t fixed receiver blocking downfield after the catch, a simple block from a downfield receiver is the difference between a touchdown and a tackle smh
Game seems A LOT more smooth than last years
Damn Brandon gaudin and Charles Davis again ! Ugh why not switch it up for next gen those two are used every year. Let’s hope they got some new lines.
Here before Eric's Burner while watching another Legendary video by Eric
hopefully you can turn off that momentum stuff
Players movement looks stiff
Same garbage game
3:30 I don't know why but I find this really funny  The way he says salty
I didn't realize Justin was that fast
Y’all know madden should’ve been using home field advantage. But home field advantage was on college football 2005 P.S everyone don’t have PS5 or Xbox series
This is a unique and fresh style of commentary with the new momentum shifts it really strengthens the atmosphere and brings the crowd into it alot more (I very often forget the crowd even exists)
How do get madden?
Do they make that noise on third down when the bears had the ball ? The 12s are nothing without that
2:15 gods I felt bad for #72
You actually made the game look good
You should do Rams vs Lions
Like the fan animation and the momentum but shaking might be a little much.
is this current gen? it looks smooth
Looks good my last madden was 17
I hate how the player movement looks. Players look slow and it looks difficult for them to make cuts
GREAT job again for your information and coverage of MAdden.  You make my favorite time of the year even better.  Awesome job Brother!  Been rocking with MAdden since the Apple Days!  Every Madden ever made.
I love what they did to the crowd noise causing distorted routes and the screen shaking when the momentum bar is full and making the crowd actually feel alive and effecting the game. I just hope it is not exclusive to seattle and other teams can do this like KC, NOLA, ATL, GB, MIN, etc etc...
They need to update td celebration
Is it honestly worth it?
Looks really good in my eyes of course I haven’t played madden since 2012 lol but I really like what I see with the next gen graphics
Maybe i missed it but didn't see anything different with presentation no cbs ,espn. So didn't add much?
Kyler got gunslinger that makes the cardinals a top 10 team to use tbh
Looks the same
Can someone tell me can you pick a team and let ai vs ai play  out instead of playing it
Keep going with it, very entertaining gameplay!
I gotta ask what difficulty is this on strictly because i saw 0....and I mean 0 off target throws from either qb...   Thats a problem
It like playing college football 05 when you can pump up the crowd. But I like that momentum swinging.
Justin herbert will be one of the best qbs in the game    Mark my words  Bolt up
people rushing to the comments to complain about the tiniest things
aye the camera angles looking clean on this game
I feel like when you are playing as a defender like a linebacker or safety, they should add number on the receivers so you know who to cover on zone plays so you’re not out of position
@3:01 I like the adjusted throw as he know the defender was closing in
Will next gen stats be available on current gen ?
“2:26 The crowd is going crazy”  Literally no one is cheering or at least clapping in the crowd…
Omg they’re actually blocking and not just walking around confused… madden actually fixed something
I haven’t played madden in years, im getting this one though. Im kinda excited to try it out.
Idk if you will see this but if you do can you do a video on current gen
The Throws in this game look legit, Eric this is a Home run man, the tackling looks more legit OL looks more better, the team over at EA are truly putting in the work
Yup the bears are definitely going to be my main on H2H
Anthony Miller ain’t even on the bears anymore bruh
Nice so they added squiggly lines when you play the Seahawks lol…..ohhhhhhhhhhh madden
90 speed what ran at combine ?
How can we get the 10 hour trial on series x.  Ea play isn't compatible with next gen.
Plug
the squiggly play art at the beginning is satisfying
I am exited for the new momentum system  Madden 22 is so close
Was that gameplay for ps5 or ps4
Russell Wilson’s release looks phenomenal
Exactly why I haven’t played Madden in years. Just can’t get with EA’s idea of simulation football
Look at the crowd, salty😂
Is this current gen
Skipped Madden the last two years but, after watching this, I might get 22. But going to wait and see how well people like it when it comes out next week.
looks like they fixed the momentum bar since the beta on sim.
The gameplay still isn't good but its the best its been in 10 years in my opinion
It was GREAT… until that mooney catch. That really turned me off of the game.
Thanks for the video drop 🙌🏽 Your commentary was fire 🔥
It seems like momentum shifts to quickly, I feel like one touchdown drive is way too common for it to be able to completely unlock the next momentum level.
Sucks we won't get any of this on Xbox one/PS4
Casuals the game will look the same every year. Its all about how it feels which is different pretty much every year.
Yo Eric you the man for putting this up for us to see. Been following you since Madden 17 you've always come through for your followers giving us updates and what's to come. Keep doing your thing my guy, respect.👊🏿
Thanks!
The only problem I have is you still see the wide receivers don’t block the man right in front of them on run plays and instead run right past them
Go Bears!
Madden is so good now… I pray for no exploits
When is 2k coming out with a real simulation football game definitely not buying this 🗑 don’t even got up to date rosters Anthony Miller plays for the Texans
Thanks for the upload and confirming skipping this year’s madden
Awsome!!!🏈👍
Could someone please tell me if any of this is on current gen
We need some current gen gameplay.
The goat weric
The crowd lol
It looks pretty but the actual game mechanics look so sluggish. These x-factor things are ridiculous and what I’d expect from an arcade game like nfl street. Same goes for the momentum stuff. It’s a damn shame. Maybe some day the game engine will be changed to something not bad.
Are you still able to get Madden 22 for free on Next Gen if you buy Madden 22 on current gen than switch to next gen?
How did they do the play art worse than ncaa14
Ok I LOVE the momentum and home field advantage perks!
Pockets still don't form. OL/DL play still trash. This is disappointing af.
What is the frame rate? Does next gen games hit 120fps? Cheers
I see they going for that NCAA 14 vibe with is a nice step but I already knew gameplay wasn't really gonna change I just pray that franchise mood is improved
All this momentum stuff seems cool and all but I can already tell there is going to be a multitude of exploits from this new system
What would be cool is if all this special ability stuff was hidden and behind the scenes, no overlays showing the stuff and no explanations. Just let it play out behind the scenes
Basically corner routes are still a glitch just with better graphics
Eric inspirational as always
I dont like the new camera shake feature.. Gotta be a way to turn it off
Wavy play art can still be read.
No you threw that ball 😂 that was your mistake not Justin’s ‼️🐻⬇️ good video though
Have they fixed the crowd noise in madden 22? I swear, in ‘21 I would throw a 50 yard completion down field for a touchdown and the home crowd would just be silent. Totally kills the immersion of the game.
will all this be on current gen too or only next gen
Sad how he had to play both side to actually make it fun 🤦🏾‍♂️
That’s literally all I wanted was for more qbs to have given slinger so I don’t have to play with packers.
That was exciting and that's coming from someone who thinks that Madden has been awful since moving past the PS2 and OG Xbox era.
Madden looks actually fun this year thank the lord 🙏
Great job on the content Eric!!!!!!
Amazing video eric
They don’t seem as so move much better
please tell me that damn noise is not in the game when a TD is scored
Damn this game actually looks fun finally !
So is it even worth getting for PS4? I plan on getting a PS5 whenever they’re even available. How is the movement on PS4?
So halo skulls. They added halo skulls and sold madden 21 again. At least they added something I guess
Madden 20 3.0
I appreciate Eric for trying to put interesting commentary over this trash gameplay what a joke of a game
Game looks like the same trash can as last year. Won’t be playing until they revamp the game. Thanks for your video and helping my decision.
Looks the exact same as last gen nothing new
Is this for ps4 to the crowd goes crazy
The game looks great dude i hate when people say it looks the same, what more can they do the gameplay looks more fluid and people still complain lol can’t win with these haters
Most likely playing on rookie or pro
Look at the center at 8:10. That’s what’s wrong with madden. It will never be good until o line is fixed
Eric should've pressed X earlier that's the reason Bears lost
Awesome commentary bro! Kept me entertained throughout the entire vid.
I wanna see bangers all year long I’m dropping multiple likes ❤️
I played the beta it’s different from 21 for ppl saying it’s the same game it’s not.. they taken steps in the right direction.. n for everyone saying the players r moving to slow everyone doesn’t have the same speed u can tell the difference in each player y’all want everyone to run like they got 99 speed 🤦🏽‍♂️
7:35 Missed a WIDE OPEN RB for TD
Good stuff Wric
Sheesh RB at 7:35 wide tf open lol
Mooney and Cohen looked a lil slow
Any update on superstar abilities
Like this type of vid keep
You had a TD B4 the 2 min warning lol
Definitely feels and looks like the same game as last year. Just more noise? 🤔
That deep bomb animation drives me nuts I really wish they would fix that and for the love of the game please figure out how to let me cut up field after a catch 🤨
Will it be like this for last gen?
Salty once again 🤣🤣❤️ awesome video I really liked it
You sold the game
It looks like the players run slower     Commentary was fire tho
I don't want to continue the negativity. So I'll say something positive. I like that they're getting more interactive with the gameplay. Still a little stiff but I like where they're going.
Sick vid 🔥🔥🔥
The scoreboard should be at the bottom
I’m sad, the momentum is only for next gen, and I’m a ps4 player
that was exciting!
Seeing the same plays from last year and the defense is pretty bad, looks like the same game from last year smh
Yu can tell these so kall people dnt really play madden like that bcuz if yall did Yu would kno dis game better den last year dey took a step in the right direction styll room for improvement but all together a good game dis year
“Madden looks so good and realistic” Jamal Adams interception*  “Ahhh maybe not so much”
i hope that pc gets the next gen verison of this game hopfully they add it later on in like november like they did with the next gen consoles but i doubt that they will
💪🏽💪🏽
I am so hyped. I’m going to be in an online Franchise and I’m going to be using Seattle. So hyped.
Eric just entered legendary youtuber territory with this vid wow
Player movement looks a lot cleaner. Game looks less glitchy more refined. Will have to see how it feels hopefully a step in the right direction compared to last year
I’ve seen so many videos praising M22 and people who dislike the game and have shown gameplay and screenshots.... I’m so undecided on this game man. 😶
Is this on ps4?????
This was a nail bitter lol, thanks Eric!
when the screen shakes does the controller shake to ?
#shopmaster
What a movie!!!
Man that’s was fun to watch🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can u do a vid in unlocking all of the x factors like u did in ‘21?
Hit Mooney a sec to late
#shopmaster
Shop master put me on
Thanks Eric
Game play looks hugely improved!
Thank God for Football
I like this madden
Why they do my guy Fields like this bro
Games looks good! Thx Eric and FINALLY!
I wish they would add refs on the field.
Idk lol run blocking still looks a little iffy
The speed of the players looks slower than ever
Seems like speed actually matters when running out the pocket 👍
why do they wait 2 days before its available to play to drop game play ?
this game look the same play the same these goofy animations
Man that ZONE is trash man cover 2 man let’s go
I actually like how the gameplay is this year. So much more interaction, better animations, with the sidelines stuff, and the camera angles man I love it
Smh can’t do it can’t buy this game this year I’m sorry I see very little difference.
Do our saints bro
I love Eric's enthusiasm, but I don't want momentum or homefield advantage sh** in MUT or competitive play. It has no place there.
ahhhhhh
Kinda unfortunate to see that the superstars and X factor abilities are the exact same as 21
Gonna be at this game In real life😂. Hella Excited
same game 🥱🥱
This is literally the same game
Finnnallyyy
It’s a big step up from 21 but people will still hate
FINALLLLY!!!!!!
