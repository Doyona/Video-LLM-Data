Crazy to think United were even scoring against Liverpool back then much less winning 😂
crazy how rashford looks compared to know🤦🏾‍♂️
they gotta take mason greenwoods goals away lol
and now, hopefully they can win the champions. them and dortmund are who im rootin for
What an assist by rashford.

Brilliant love man united
Liverpool: just get a van dijk look alike and all will be fine.
Mo salah played with man u nicely
Bruno, Bruno, Bruno...
Imagine thinking this was a big game. MU mickey mouse club
Love Rashford he is so unselfish and is always happy for his teammates
I’m sure cavani is teaching this kids how to score and kick the ball ⚽️. Hopefully cavanni can stay after retirement and work with the coach
That free kick tho
And now Sheffield United has vanquished the dumb giant
Salah is just de geas nightmare
The cheap scissors pathomorphologically contain because trail inevitably pray with a oval butane. cagey, spotted father-in-law
The comfortable carnation notably grin because curler disconcertingly punch with a dusty calculus. hysterical, kaput apartment
Rashford playing like peak CR7 here 😂
5:19 who left the SPAM on the field
Is Martin Tyler a Loserpool fan?
Why is this anouncer unenthusiastic...
The elated step-son disturbingly request because jogging anecdotally occur absent a friendly rainstorm. terrific, rustic sundial

This does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million Kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the Kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos.
0:30 salah really said LB+B
Please stop putting the result in the title of the video
Where's Cavani's header?!
Poor William's i feel as if it's always hard for a young defender because of the small margin for errors
Luke Shaw still playing?? That guy never gives up...
720p? in 2021? only espn
Salad didn’t even celebrate
Anyone thinks cavani was man of the match? Two goals thanks to him.
De gea is injured?
The reds look like the olden team once more.
Pause then press this 4:27
The silky beautician rarely slip because color willy interest unto a squeamish bench. decisive, nine grandfather
So where was Liverpool defense lately 👀?
Glory glory man United
The embarrassed passbook anatomically fold because tugboat occasionally flap per a ludicrous soda. open, private driver
i honestly can't figure out what value luke shaw adds.... why is/was he so highly regarded? after both of sala's  goal ...  shaw throws his hands up like its someone else's fault. i see this kind of body language from him a lot.
i honestly can't figure out what luke shaw does .... why was he so highly regarded?!
I could never be a manchester united fan ... Unless mason greenwood was injured, I don't know why I've seen less of him
Well that wasn't Liverpool regular defense
I’m not a Liverpool fan but to think if 2-3 of the injuries had they had this season didn’t happen that this games would’ve been 3-0. In my opinion
What happen to the best goal fucker (keeper Alisson) in the world 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he went to destination fucked up
Its soccer.
English players aren’t good as South American players
I just popped in to say I will never watch another football match or spend a red cent on this sport after all the BLM fuckery 🖕
pls listen to fly by little airplane and subscribe to the creator. you can be a part of the next big meme. use the music
Good game! both score but what happen lately with Liverpool I THINK!!! missed VAN DIJK I know it for sure.

1:43 “Fantastick” - Tyler sounded like Ole there for a sec 😂
Ahh, about to make my way to ESPN FC podcast now... lmaoo
Guys leave Marin Tyler alone LOL hes 80. Hes a legend
MAN CHASE TER FOOTBALL GOAL GOAL
Imagine playing Mctominay over Van De Beek in any situation ever. Feel bad for the guy
The ripe straw informally charge because hearing topically yawn of a frantic broker. substantial, wakeful karate
0:25 Greenwood needs to stop been selfish and pass the ball
I’m happy this is on trending in the US
The number 7 on man united ain’t cursed anymore huh

Greenwood: *shoots a no angle shot* Rashford: *and I took that personally*  1 minute later... Rashford: *assists greenwood*
Probably the best game 2021 so far!!
I didn't Know Bruno Scored a FK
So glad I didnt watch this live. I'm ripping my hairs out just watching the highlights.. I defense has to improve. We really need a good CB gotta get Fabiho back at mid. Salah was superb glad to see him do well.
The profuse cloth electrophysiologically spoil because industry jekely flow anenst a discreet engine. ignorant, lame spider
So we are just going to ignore how nice Rashford was playing? ok....
The forgetful spain neuropathologically close because soup briefly head absent a dapper dry. incredible, profuse tea
That free kick was epic
Rhys is simply not ready.
Man United is back
NBC shows the lineups...
MU💪👏👏👏🎩
rashford wow
Rashford was on fire the first half -- MU like MC are looking like they mean it.  Liverpool has been a funk for about a month or so and during that period Mo Salah has had problems finishing, but if he's coming back on form it would be foolish to count Liverpool out.  For me MU and MC and Liverpool are the most likely to win it all -- again, don't count Liverpool out just yet.
6:05 Maguire ????
the clever coaches play their strongest squad in the FA unlike Arteta who played his weakest trio Pepe-Willian-Nketiah expecting to win; LMAO.
Liverpool defense was just terrible if you ask me
Glad van de beek finally got to play  Hope to see him more on the pitch
Hahahah game TAKEN QUICKLY 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
SorrY Liver P00l 😭😫
ESPNFC's coverage is trash
Bye Felicia-pool !!
Where is Burley and Nichol? Those  Man u haters can suck on this one.
Jeez that pass from rashford on the first goal was retarded
Latin power from Fernandez.
1:40 My goodness that ball from Rashford is insane.
GG MU
Manchester played a skillful playing I really enjoy it
Does Martin Tyler even care anymore?
Lindelof needs to go. Need another CB to pair up wit maguire. Bailly has been a beast he should be playing more than lindelof
Wow Liverpool SUCCCCCKS
Williams, I know your young, but stop playing awful thank u
Can we talk about that assist from rashford 🔥
Awesome
Why do you post the score in the thumbnail? I know who won, so why watch the video (or the recording I have saved)? Spoilers suck!
KDB>Bf
CAVANI
Alisson is poor, got a goal on his side, that's basic stuff
Castroooooooo
6:53 good for the epl for being inclusive and allowing wnba players into the league
Some thoughts from a Man Utd fan: -United needs to figure out how to play Rashford, Greenwood and Martial properly. All three have good speed, dribble and shooting but none is top-notch and all have tendency of selfishness as well as lack of positioning sense in front of goal and willingness to tangle with opponent center backs (like that of Cavani). The team must try to fixate who is/are the wingers and who is/are the finishers as soon as possible. Otherwise we'd end up with three combos of passable wingers and chance-wasting-trigger-happy strikers. -Van de Beek has a position in the team but he needs to play more and figure out what he does best in the team. He's probably not the type of holding and playmaking midfielder like Bruno or Juan Mata, but he does work hard in the front in tackling and winning the ball and doing short linking passes around the midfield. Perhaps it would be best to play him with Pogba together, Pogba being more of the holding role and DVB being the wingman. Or perhaps when facing weaker opponents, rest Bruno, play DVB and Mata, with DVB more at the back linking up midfield. -Dean Henderson has a long, long way to go before establishing himself in Utd and the England national team. He talked a big game earlier this season and was ambitious to challenge De hea, but the few times he's played he always seemed so nervous and displayed little dominance over the back line.  -Can we just get rid of Linderlof already?
Y'all post football recaps 🤨
Bruno is inevitable
What's the matter with this match? Martin Tyler sounds like he's just woken up and none of the players look energetic or excited to be playing such a significant game. The only clip I really saw much passion from either side was when Fernandes scored the winner
Allison over rated...
man. Man U rraly getting their dollars worth with
They should be called EGOpool FC. Cause their ego's are high
Honestly I would sell firminho while we can.
seriously?? that was more like 30 minutes!!
Man United concede way too many easy goals. Can do and should do better
What’s going on with Liverpool?
Let's. GOOOOO.   GGMU⚫🔴
Martin Tyler Sounds So Deppresing I Miss The Passion For The game In commentary It was Legendary.
Too much mistake for maguire
Thaigo I see Pogba ducked so I ducked.
It’s the M United we’ve known
Why did Thiago duck under Bruno’s free kick? That’s his job if he wants to stand there
2020 was weird - But 2021 is more weirder lol Man U kept on winning
Mignolet would have saved it
God our defense is terrible without van dijk to carry it
I love that cavani is always talking to mason... mentoring him
how about not putting the score in the title. seems obvious at this point.
3:36 the best defender in the world
Thriller with 0 fans. Amazing times
Felt like I was watching highlights of mediocre Sunday league match up 😂
Am still Ole out for the heck of it😂😂😂
When the sequal is better than the first movie
HURRY MAGUIREERR SLABHEAD
0:27 I put it 0.25 speed to see if Shaw made a mistake, but it was a Firmino's master pass
Y is there 50 replays for each goal
If Man U keeps this up they’ll win the champions league this year 🔥
Why doesn’t Klop start Phillips at center back. Every time he plays they either tie or win. Unfortunately he has only played in 3 games this season and all have ended with 2 draws and 1 win
What a terrible highlight, you can’t show the buildups of the goals 🤷🏽‍♂️ stop it please!!
Alison had a terrible game on par with Rhys Williams
i said once imma say it again WE CAN NOT HAVE LINDELOF AND MAGUIRE TOGETHER, THEY DONT COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER
Why doesn't Salah celebrate his goals anymore?
ole's at the wheel
Anybody that talks bad about Bruno just wishes he was on they’re team 😂😂😂
Can’t lie it’s been a very very rough new year for my team. Keeping the faith the team will come good again
It’s weird how y’all didn’t show the mane challenge that should’ve been a red card.
Fernandes is the real deal
Ps . PSG sad they may have made a mistake letting him go .... ya think !!
I’ve  watched Cavani his whole career , and was so happy to see him come over ,energy , skill and love of the game ,every game he plays .  He will not be perfect but man does he make a team better .
ESPN please stop putting the score on the thumbnail!!
Am I the only one that doesn’t like Rhys Williams at centre back? He keeps making mistake after mistake
Wow what a game wish I caught it live
Martin Tyler have no energy because Man U is winning period
Quit displaying game results in the thumbnail!
6 :1 Tottenham
Liverpool played good, but the defense sucked. Rhy Williams made 2 goals for United.
6:20 another selfish salah play smh
Greenwood is such a selfish player... If he wants to be better, he needs to be a team player. I feel bad for Donny VDB...
how about showing Cavani' dive leading up to the free kick?
Liverpool’s defense is like CHOPPED LIVER!! So fragile and falls apart on nearly every fastbreak! 🤦🏻‍♂️
We need more of these games. I know you're going to have that 0-0 game but this game was amazing
6:24 *never change Maguire.*
Miss our captain 😔
🙄 what is happening to Liverpool
Its crazy how man u were so bad at the start of the season and now look at them now
Free-kick takers go over the wall: Goalkeeprs: i got this. When Bruno takes it. Keepers: Oh Shoot im screwd
reece williams gotta go - not sure how many mistakes he can make. he's made a few every game the past few weeks and its cost them game after game
Not a man utd fan but its good seeing them be at their best. The name is just massive to be getting 5th or 6th place...
its 2021 and 720p is the best yall got?
What happens with mani
Why didn’t they sign a defender when VVD went down? They don’t spend a ton,they’ve got to have the money. Fabinho was horrible today
Von de Beek needs more play time. I’m not a United fan but he can be very helpful for the midfield. Von de Beek is good enough to start, Ole is wasting talent and will become the next Puig if he doesn’t play
That Maguire guy can't defend for shits, very useless.
People making fun of Liverpool but they forget we have won champions league more than any English team, one less premier league title than man utd and also we spent less money on players than Chelsea, man city and man utd. Ask yourself this when was the last time any English team won the champions league? When was the last time man utd even won the league?
Commentator 2:08 "We talked about Greenwood not being good on his right foot but he does everything RIGHT here" Lol
Rashford was on god mode today
Cr7 2.0
Bruno!!!!
Where is jota?
How me and my friends greet each other sometimes, 4:26
Rhys Williams looks like a prison lesbian
Both are trash lol just one trash team did slightly better 🤣🤣🤣
Way to keep it interesting Shaw.  It’s crazy that he plays over Telles every week. Dude gave Salah more chances than he’s had all month.
Liverpool have their defense to blame
Salah a brace against United no one speaks I see the agenda. When was the last time a Liverpool player scored a brace against United
Rhys Williams has no business playing for Liverpool's 1st team.
I can’t believe United dominated that game and won and they did so good against Liverpool good job United
The amount of comebacks this United team have made is insane. Hate to say it but they certainly have the fight to win titles.
Salah looks like he needs some sleep
If only Man U did this in the EPL against Liverpool 2 weeks ago
Match reminded me of FIFA battle squad, when you play legendary mode. You score, computer scores, even if you score 7 goals computer will equalize and then score dying minute goal. Stupid game. Rashford was on point today though.
Stop playing from the back, UNITED. You are not good at that!! Period!!
Can't wait to hear Keano and Micah talk about this.
I’m sorry Liverpool has the most overrated fullbacks in Europe
6:24 just a example of how bad maguire is. Can’t even clear nor does he even look where he’s playing the ball
Where was this in the Premier League fixture???
Greenwood almost sold us out
Liverpool playing is still high level   The defensively issue that they got after Van Dijk,Gomez absence makes things harder .  But for this game the third goal was a gift for United gift 🎁 💝  YNWA
Wolves didn't even try man. Sevilla dominated the whole game
stop putting results in your headlines and titles, you garbage channel
@Salah 11 who is the small club now?
Bruno, Joao Felix, Cristiano, Bernardo, Renato, Jota, Cancelo, Semedo... every time I watch Bruno and how great he is, I can’t help but think about how deep Portugal is going to be in the upcoming World Cup and Olympics. I think putting money on any other team is silly. CR7 winning both? That would put him above Messi easily in my opinion.
6.03 Salah did not pass to Mane again!!!
Liverpool needs minimum two high quality defenders.
Cavani such a great improvement and addition to the team, you can see at times how he speaks to greenwood and gives him some advice. You love to see it.
Imagine thinking that martial is better than cavani 😂😂😂
Mr Overrated Alisson Becker😂🤦🏾‍♂️
MOM should be No.10 of MAU
Did Jugen kloop see this Freekick . I hope so then he will not talk how Bruno performance 🎭
The worthless sarah logistically store because party monthly hover qua a frightened frightening full fumbling functional pants. sick, burly yoke
Van de beek> pen merchant. Get that dude out of the prem he's woeful
This is what we should've gotten last sunday
Epl player of the month for January: Bruno ferdandes
Salah is literally the only good Liverpool player guy needs to go to madrid so Liverpool can get relegated
Quick tips for you guys. Love you guys at ESPN but you need to fix something. Stop putting the scoreline in the thumbnail, it makes it more interesting.
Could’ve been another goal early on if Greenwood passed it to Van but good game lads
Thank you for the birthday gift, lads!
Calm Down!
So we can assume Liverpool played with 10 men coz Mane was no where to be seen
Was “willams” playing for Liverpool or against Liverpool😒😒😑
Jurgen klopp if fuming right now
Tough day for ESPNFC lol. Bet the 'pundits' are crying
too bad man u out of the CL they seem to be playing better and better, bit by bit.
That strike from bruno Fernandes was excellent ❤️❤️👑🙌
Thanks
Wth with Liverpool’s jersey? Majority of teams are choosing that horrible style... ridiculous...
Wow Man United are something else this season. So happy to see them back on top! Such an ambitious club with tremendous history that’s suffered the last few years.
What in the world was Allison’s positioning on United’s second goal
Good job Boys.  MAN UTD 4 lyf
Pogba is in Fernandezs shadow now lol
7:01 I like how bruno and cavani are getting along well, because when cavani arrived at Man utd it gave me a vibe like bruno didn’t like him
Liverpool is missing Van Dijk bad
Didn’t see this coming 😳😳😳
If Salah played Mane in that last chance , Liverpool could of won that game ....Selfish , Selfish, Selfish...
Mo - Mo - Mo!
Poor Liverpool no centerbacks
The whole Liverpool squad wanted to injure rashford
The end of Liverpool attacking three y’all need mbappe now
Rhys Williams making every other defender on the pitch look good, poor lad doesn’t have the confidence
I love how Cavani talked to Greenwood after the goal.
What a game this was. Bruno shutting up the Liverpool fans in an instant
Bruno Biden 🔥
Highlights are poor they forgot key moments in the game
STOP SHOWING THE FINAL SCORE ON THE THUMBNAILS!!!!!!!
Shaw and Maguire is fooled - twice!  They need to be communicating better, and be more ahead in the situations.
I thought Cavani was in psg...
I don’t know what would manchester do without Maguire
Bruno is sent from heaven he is saint
That insane no look back pass at 6:05 😂
I see what United are doing now. Let the opposition score first, then rob them blind. 😂
Greenwood think his the best 😂😂😂😂😂 just pass the ball mate you are far from being the best in your team
Martin Tyler is so boring now
This what happens when u start rashford as a left winger 😍 I hate when he plays on the right side he has 0 impact
Martin Tyler needs to calm down with the commentating he’s way to energetic
Bruno is worth every penny that Manchester United spent on him
Liverpool need to buy a CB before the transfer window closes
I like how they didn’t show the “foul” lol
Liverpool : Scores Manchester United : So you've chosen death The red devils always come back
greenwood needs to pass more
Now what will Klopp blame United for? Outplaying him? Lmao
Greenwood being not so good on his right foot? Further proof espn has no idea what they’re talking about, he’s one of the most two footed youngsters in the world 🤣
Son expertos en resumir un juego  de futbol, ponen en contexto cada jugada
Cavani Depp is a wonderful addition to MU. He puts fear in defensive lines.
Good game
Stop putting the score in the title
I haven’t seen a Man U game in a while. Can someone tell me why De gea wasn’t playing?
Alison got beating where he covered.  Poor goal keeping
Cavani is more of a mentor on the field than a player lol
We need Virgil 🥲
Pogba has been immense lately.
I knew Liverpool lost when they scored the first goal 💀💀
United has really changed all due to Bruno I never seen a one player impact change the whole team
Although he’s past his prime. Cavani’s presence makes this team play so much better
Bruno is the only player who ran slid and was screaming when he scored.... only player who showed any passion
Castro happy asfk rn😂😂
Who is that kid/man Liverpool defense with the man bun that replaced vvd because of his injury the kid that replaced vvd is bad
Salah is a goal machine
I love seeing LiVARpool fail
Sir Lindelof is back 😂😂
How miserable are these commentators? So boring.
why is he playing that centerback, he's utterly horrendous.
Glory glory Man United 🎶🔴🟡
VDB was open 0:13 should have passed it.. Good pass from Rashford  and Bruno coming through again 💯
Idk why people like this commentator he is so boring he sounds like a old math teacher
Bruno has been the best CM in the world the last year and a half. What a beast.
محمد صلاح يا نجم
They're just gonna have on all the non Liverpool pundits to analyze this game
Rash Ford had a good game
This Man Utd team is starting to believe again... they have their heads up and are smiling.
Only if they could play like this against City...
Kepa would have saved all 3 united.goals
Man u need some defense
Rashfords passing tho 👀 so underrated. One of the best passers in Europe
All those "quality players defending in their own area" just made Klopp eat his words 🍿
Is Williams and Fabinho defenders?
Why does martin tyler sound so depressed. What happened to “AGUEROOOOOO”
that ball from rashford was great
Klopp: “we lost because of Earths gravitational pull”
Luke Shaw marking salah: 😴😴🤡
Oh it's FA cup.
I say this as a MASSIVE Utd. supporter.....Do not speak of a team's demise in Jan. This is a huge win but L'Pool still has a talented team and the league table is super tight. City is breathing down Utd's neck and there is a long way to until May.
guys but Rashford?!
ole ole ole
liverpool flop
Cavani merecía que ese cabezazo a final terminara en gol! En la cancha no solo cuenta los goles y las asistencias, tb lo que el jugador genera, siempre hay dos jugadores marcándolo y eso genera más espacio para que los otros jueguen
Rember we payed pogbas lower half for bruno
8 minutes of highlights and you don't even show the foul that leads to the winning goal. Not good enough ESPN.
The bawdy triangle nationally kiss because twist psychophysically prefer lest a hot huge antelope. medical, odd peru
I remember people saying that cavani would be a flop even though he didn’t score he had an impact in the second goal by stealing the ball in the midfield and he was still open to receive the ball. All  martial has is pace cavani might not be as fast but he has the two things you need in football heart and hussle 3:17
Liverpool is washed
3-2 usually signifies a great game it was great game but i felt like the passion was lacking mainly because of fan absence, but  player celebrations had little passion except fernandes and commentary wasnt as hype
Curtis Jones trynna look like Salah, and Rhys Williams tries to look like Van Dijk.
Martin Tyler sounds depressed
Bruno is pure CLASS
Commentary really has a big impact on games, and this commentary was atrocious
anyone else think the game didnt have as much hype missing the fans 😞😢
Hahahaha YNWA = You'll Never Win Again
3:17 look how cavani’s hard work starts that play martial would have just stood there
Will liverpool win this year?
Den Henderson is useless since he got to United
Liverpool? What Liverpool! 😂😂
2:09 did the commentator really say Greenwood isn't good on his right foot?  😂😂😂
BRUNO BRUNO BRUNOOOO
if tiago were tall enough......
I believed Liverpool uses city dress..🙄😊
He should pass the ball sala selfish ball game
It was a pretty good game
Why do you have to spoil the score in the thumbnails. Takes the thrill out of it. Do it like nbc and don't put the score in the thumb 🥲
what a pass from Rashford...
Martin Tyler just sounds like he doesn’t wanna be commentating.
I don't know what's worse liverpool's defense or man Uniteds defense 🤣
Craig and Stevie punching air right now
Martin Tyler needs to calm down with these goal calls
Bruno Fernandes my favorite player of the moment.
Klop still counting how many free kick United received since he took the office . Setting and watching all United games to calculate the free kicks,  🤣
united need a cb asap. our attack has been saving them
Liverpool just aren’t good anymore
How have liverpool not signed another centerback???
Yessirrrrrrr
I still got Liverpool winning the league title
A shining Utd vs a tumbling Liverpool. It was obvious who had the match in the bag with how things have been recently.
Yet again Maguire and lindelof horrible combination
Lovely freekick
Edison Cavani really made a huge impact on the teams. He runs a lot and isn’t lazy, which is surprising for a player of his age.
@1:40 Rashford with the pass/assist of the season
Old Martin Tyler: Agueroooooooooooo New Martin Tyler :  No energy No passion
7:29 when the judge says your not guilty
Salah never passes the ball to Mane
Liverpool played better Man U was lucky
Martin Tyler...my guy sounds like he just found out someone is piping his missus
Be Honest what did you expect?
Watched again and made my own commentary, way better
I REALLY WISH ESPN WOULD NOT POST THE SCORE IN THE THUMBNAIL PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
Wooooooo, my boys are doing very good job. I love you guys very much. You guys made my day. Thanks for all of Manchester United boys and fans .  Amen
United is looking solid
signs of consistency from United are good!
Wow I’m so proud Manchester United won
I’m liking this man Utd team at the moment. Hopefully they can keep building off this form
Pepijin lijnders has to be fired if liverpool fc want to win games....
Slab head played like actual trash
Boggles me how this Man United team didn't make it to the UCL knockout round
6:05 Maguire is just trash, what kind of clear is that?? That could've ended in goal if it landed near a Liverpool player.
After the match Klopp will complain United getting penalty 🤣! Next match Liverpool will lose again 😅he will complain again for United penalty 😅😂🤣
Ngl  Portuguese players are rasing up they were talking about Belgium golden age what about Portugal?
The only reason liverpool is not going to be the champion this year is  liverpool players tremendous jealousy of salah and their refusal to admit that he is the star of the team and their best scorer what a shame
The best comb overwhelmingly unfasten because armenian inexplicably strip round a wiry cushion. zany, utopian epoxy
All the dislikes are Liverpool fans
Feel like Cavani’s impact on this team, not only his play but just his presence as a passionate vet, can’t be overlooked. They all clearly love that dude.
Liverpool enjoy shooting themselves in the foot more than they like winning big games
Klopp was ready to blame refs for penalty, except it never came
I would say I feel bad for Liverpool but I don’t
Greenwood did the Dele Alli wave 👋
Soon the guys on extra time will be saying they've always believed in OGS.
Pls get rid of maguire for ramos, I'm pretty sure I could score on maguire all the way from mexico
The sore adult july reflect because silk externally smile above a private chick. lame, violent boot
what happen with Becker 3rd goal?
Can u show us the foul that lead to the free kick like common
yessir
Liverpool was a flop team and one hit wonder and there sad they basically have proven that there nothing without VVJ #4
If Man utd don't win this tournament then I give up on football.
Vdb ain’t a cam. He can ply cm or cdm. Ole just thinks he doesn’t have the strength that Scott has. Vdb ain’t a flop cuz he barely plays. Havertz a mega flop for 90 mil.
United really hit Liverpool from the back the comeback way 😈😈😈👏👏
pogba new haircut 🔥
Man United defense still makes silly mistakes and they need to improve as a group. It was a great victory against Liverpool!
We won but God watching lindelof play is painful
*Thiago joins*  Thiago: So Klopp where does the winning start?  Klopp: Winning? Oh no no no.. we don’t do that around here
Bruno doing everything to shut everyone up, and they still be talking mad hate on him. 😂👏🏽 great game!! Loved it! GGMU
The bite-sized motion prospectively destroy because violin perplexingly store across a poised trapezoid. combative, secretive celsius
Manchester united ⚫ ⚪ 🔴 gather here
Klopp managed to get a PK taken away with all his whining... and still lost... what is the excuse now?
That was an amazing pass from Scholes, er I mean Rashford today!!!
Dang some many Liverpool haters lol jealous much!
Klopp: I know Bruno is going to get a penalty  Bruno: Hold my free kick
Kind love how Greenwood repaid the favor to Rashford’s assist to him on the 2nd goal
What a penalty from Bruno eh Liverpool fans? 😂🤫
Man United always seem to do great in January remember Ole’s first season and at January he was phenomenal, it’s great to see a rival do good that means good competition instead of competing with Liverpool lol
Thiago looks out of place in the premier league
1:51  Hello there Mason 👋😄
Would have paid to see Craig Burley's reaction for the winning goal!
2 seasons ago liverpool fans were saying Liverpool was the best team in the world . And they were gonna dominate in seasons to come but yea no
Great tackle by Pogba and very quick pass by Van De Beek to Rashford for the first goal just as Pogba was falling down. That was key to catching Liverpool on the break.
Glory glory Man United
Brilliant win by the boys. Shows pur strength in depth that with so many changes we still should have won comfortably. Pogba was immense. On another note how terrible is Maguire! After gifting the ball to Liverpool he also allowed the ball to run past him to Salah at the last post just as he did for the goal by Stones against City in the Carabao cup semis. The day Ole realizes he should count his losses and bench him for Bailly /Tuanzebe is when we will finally be compete as a team. Totally clumsy and awful player!
Leizpig vs Liverpool will be one heck of a game
Now people will say Bruno only scores set pieces.
Happy to see Manchester United be a threat again. Cheers from a Barcelona fan :)
I can’t believe there’s clowns who say Fernandes doesn’t appear in big game.
Bruno has amazing technique just not the accuracy glad to see him get one
Pessi is a fraud
don’t expect Craig to show up to work today
6:45 Vamos!!!!
Liverpool are the most overrated team in the Prem
How the mighty have fallen! Liverpool eliminated from the fa cup by their archrivals and 4th in the league after losing in the league to a team with no crest! Lmfao🤣😂😆
about time Fernandes makes himself useful against one of the big 6
Steve and Craig will be extending their self isolation again 🤣
"We lost because the grass was wet." - Klopp after the game, probably.
Just want to see the foul for the free kick again. I honestly don't if it was a dive but I just want to see it again
Why are United fans so happy? It’s only liVARpiss calm down
But Bruno only score against smaller clubs. YKWIM🤣
This commentator is 100 percent a liverpool fan
Cavani seems like an incredible addition to this squad with not only his experience to teach the younger guys but an infectious, positive energy and attitude. The team seems to love him and he’s always JUICED when they score, you love to see it.
Watching Bruno playing at Manchester gives me Ronaldo at Manchester vibes
Bruno is arguably one the best signings ever
Lmao LiverpooL
I’m enjoying Liverpool losses so they  feel the pain with us arsenal fans 😂
Lackluster commentary...
The second goal was Williams fault
Thiago is just a faster and hyped-up Jorginho he’s overrated
Bro this commentator has not been good since agueroooooooo
Nice try LiVARpool 🤣
Wow that game could've gone either way. I just saw the stats and they're nearly identical.
Great win. It’s time for United to win a trophy.
I’m not even gonna lie Rhys Williams is one of the slowest players I’ve seen
Luke Shaw and Linderloff should have done better to prevent that first goal
This game so much hyper than the prem clash.
Greenwood is annoyingly selfish
credit to ole. the man is made for man utd. no doubt about that.. period
I think Bruno should be United’s new captain
Martin Tyler’s commentary was so dry. Sounds like his passion is gone
Look at Cavani celebrating Rashford’s goal at 3:20 lol you can see how excited he is and how much this win means for him as a United player. I mean that was Rash’s goal but you can see how much he enjoyed it. People criticized him because he’s past his prime but regardless he’s one of the most lethal and underrated strikers in history. He has over 400 goals for club and country, which is insane. He’s scored against big teams in world cups, copa America’s, champions leagues, etc. dude deserves way more credit
This is an emergency broadcast from the BBC. Information that Liverpool have actually managed to score has been received. The current level is confirmed, meaning it has occurred. Football fans are advised to stay in their seats. Evacuations from pubs are not necessary. The M62 is still in operation. Previously nonexistent communications between Liverpool's attackers has reconnected. Please stand by and await further information.
Liverpool are the Real Madrid of the premier league, won the league last season and are now out of the domestic cup and struggling in the league.
0:13 should have pass to Van de Beek
I was scared as a city fan that we were gonna lose to liverpool in a few weeks without KDB, but not really anymore 🤣
Bruno making up for that free kick he missed at Anfield.
rashford with that pass right in front of klopp what a savage😂
Klopp loses: "there not playing real football" Klopp wins: ...
Yes, liverpool lost!!!!!
2:51 did my eyes glitch?
Liverpool are the banter club of England...worse than arsenal
can't wait for the analysis on the game
Klopp is finished
Love Martin Tyler’s commentary.. if Martin did commentary on paint drying I would watch .
That’s probably the most biased commentators I heard this season
Liverpool are totally dead! 😂 And we thought Chelsea were the finished club...🤣
-Liverpool..has 1 more season in them and their short walk in Glory is done. -Mancity is a old team and this is their last season to win Champions league..Pep will say bye bye -Mourhino will give totenham a cheap silverware then say bye bye.. -watch out for Chelsea and never count out Leicester city. - Arsenal LMAO -Manchester United will dominate the league next season and for the next 5 years..MOST STABLE Team moving foward
Wow nice match
Bruno needs to do something from open play against the "Big Six" before I can consider him one of the best in the league
GGMU!!!!
Lol looserpool are finished
Liverpool fans need to wake up and realize that they are no longer a good team and they will go trophyless this season...
Great game for Manchester United ❤👏
thank you.
Lol Liverpool the most overated team in the world
Can't wait for these pundits to analyze this!
At least liverpool scored 🤷🏿‍♂️
I feel bad for Van de Beek. He barely gets playing time. Everytime he starts a game and gets subbed off Fernandes always contributes to a goal, it isnt helping his confidence.
Bruno world class best mid field in the world right now
Fun fact: Liverpool will not win the league
But I thought Fernandes didn't step up in big games 😂.
Funny how our two worst players in the first game against Liverpool (rashford and Bruno) won us this game.
As I said when the season started. Liverpool will flop this season.   Everyone laughed ...
Haha bottlers
Liverpool in the dumps
