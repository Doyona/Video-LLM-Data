I need to start warming up with half swings every single time I go out. One day I'll have it, the next day it feels like I've never swung a club before 😢
At the 5:13 mark. You didn't rise up until well after impact
Whatever ever happened to staying down on the ball?
what is the >Old garden cake< mean?
Great video you explain it far better than my pro , playing in winter is completely different any tips for winter golf always wet windy
Love this, thanks, Danny!!!
Thank you. Tomorrow 10/26 is my solo practice round implementing your lessons. One quick question-what about fairway woods? Any difference in setup from irons? Swing as an iron? Any recommended adjustments? Thanks in advance!
Best advice yuo  can ever give someone who golfs is to take an actual golf lesson from an actual golf pro and start over. Hands down, the best money you will ever spend on your golf game. Learning how to actually hit the fucking ball is key. You don't have to hit that shit very hard, they kinda fly off the club if you just make gud contact, kinda like when I get a gud hit of weed, naw meen G's. YW NERDS lul
Another brilliant one
Hello Danny, I had been struggling to make good contact for a couple of months after getting back into the game for the first time in 16 years (with all clubs). I wish I had watched this instruction 3 months ago, it would have saved me so much frustration and sore wrists and hands. Today I went to the driving range and practiced the motion to get "impulse" and to have the proper motion throughout my swing to get the lift on the strike. I sat there for a half an hour and just swung an iron and a driver at air. I then moved on to a 7 iron and proceeded to hit 2 buckets of balls slowly increasing my swing (started with the smallest swing as suggested). I am completely blown away at how effortless my swing has become to make good contact and get that lift and furthermore hit the ball where I am actually lining up. I did the same for driver and again completely blown away by the instant results. I struggled to hit driver straight and was averaging about 200 yards when I did. I can say now that today I hit the ball to my intended target just about every single time and I have added around 50-60 yards on my drives without swinging too hard or too fast. For all of you reading this struggling to get good contact on irons or driver this is the real deal (that is once you are gripping the club properly and getting the right swing trajectory). Spend time swinging at air for a bit then break out the balls and start with a small swing (I hit around 10 balls before increasing my swing)  and you will get results. I can honestly say in regards to just proper contact this has been a revelation for me and I look forward to getting those 100-110 scores down to the 90's and hopefully into the 80's within a year or so. Danny, I have watched several hundred instructional videos on YouTube on all phases of the game and this video gave me the quickest turn around on a problem that I have ever experienced, thanks a million mate~!
brilliant. thank you.
Best golf videos on YouTube, have always been an ok golfer. After putting in the things I see in your videos I have become way better, would say I’m a good golfer now. Thanks for all you do!
Super, practical tips.
I'm not sure we have the same definition of the word impulse.
Almost like 50 years of every hack being told nothing but "keep your head down" caused some problems.
Great video Danny! I found the putting advice very interesting and will definitely try it!
After struggling for a few years and a golfing pal trying to stop me hitting the ball with my shoulders I’m off to the range tomorrow to try your impulse swing it’s basically what he’s trying to get me to do but you explain it so well
4:00 that's the "broom" drill
Excellent video Danny!  Since I'm an impulsive kind of guy, all I have to do now is transfer this to my game and the golf course.  In all seriousness, you are correct in that the body has to have a correct impulse in order to attain a good outcome.  My biggest fault is not rotating sufficiently and consistently.  So, you know where my impulse is going to lie!  Good Job Danny!  Always enjoy your videos!!!
I don't think impulse is the right word, but this is a GREAT tip for players at all levels. People get way too mechanical and stiff!
Impulse + driver = WOW
Thanks for the heads up Danny . it helps alot
I mean it’s not a bad lesson but I don’t think you are using the word impulse correctly
Thanks Danny! Simple swing thought has already improved my game.
am i the only one that noticed the rave in the window behind him?
Thanks man that lesson really just helped my son and I and we are going to share it with my wife and daughter as well easy to understand very simple methods that I believe will help us play better and have more fun thank you for what you do God bless have a great day!
Another top lesson, thank you! 👍  My putting fell apart in a game this week and I realise now it was due to lack of impulse.  Also I've been struggling with my timing just as you've describe here, trying too hard perhaps to get the correct moves in some kind of sequence, and I think this could really help get my timing back on track.  Doing these drills I was amazed to find that just by letting the club fall from a "club parallel" position combined with clearing the left knee and hips as per the vid, I could actually get a "swish" noise from such a tiny backswing. That makes me realise the speed this is unlocking naturally and I can't wait to try it on the course!
take a shot every time he says impulse.... and you will have a high score!
OMG Danny NO ONE has EVER talked about this before that i can think of! This is SO important and makes the athletic move in the golf swing make SO much sense. EXCELLENT observation and explanation Danny. You rock!
Thank you for this lesson!!!! I feel I owe you
This is a good reset for me.  I used to have a swing as you demonstrated, “low to high”, but now everyone teaches “cover the ball”.  This has resulted in me blading, slicing, etc.  Now I feel vindicated. Great video, especially the putting tip.
😂🙏🙏👍👍👍🇩🇰🇩🇰😂😂😂😍😍
Who throws a ball like that 😂😂😂
You will never play good golf if you spend time watching Youtubers instead of actually practicing.
Danny would momentum be another word to use
Danny I've watched a couple of your videos and put your recommendations into practice and last week I've had the best golf game of my life! Thank you for your great instructional content!!
You talk super fast. That killed it for me.
Danny, another great video, thanks so much.
One of your best videos in my opinion Danny. Great reminder especially for people that practice a lot. It's easy to lose this when you're trying to make changes that aren't feeling as natural as you want them to. Thank you so much!
Everytime I see one of your videos I get this irresistible urge to swing a club.
Love the impulse drill and  concept.  This really helped my game and lower scores!  Thank you Danny!
Danny I follow your videos and have learned some very good exercises  and tips from your videos.Most people dont look at the writing on youtube about the person but I took a peek today and would have to say congratulations to you for getting to the final stages of the open championship.(Bloody brilliant)Also your honesty about the game being so hard (long and difficult). Well I practice chipping a lot  4 or 5 hours sometimes and know you should sort of throw yourself forward  a split second after contact with the ball or those short shots and I grasped this great feeling  after about 20 minutes. Its a great feeling coming out of the shot and seeing your ball go exactly where you wanted it to go.So many thanks Tim Hayes
So I've been finding confidence in literally telling myself "fuck it, just step up and hit it.". And I now realize, that was giving me some impulse.
You're the best Danny!
Great insight. I paid more attention to the « impulse » with my putts. What a difference!! I don’t need to go as far back, which helps with club face control/alignment. And I don’t leave my putts short anymore. Thanks Danny for helping me enjoy putting 😉
You have a way of explaining concepts and drills that is so palatable and easy to understand. Thank you again for your continued content. This game would be SO much more difficult without your expertise!
After years of not consistently playing, I’m just now getting back to in to playing and enjoying golf. I have to do a lot of work to be where I hope to be so I’m hoping these videos will help. 👍
What golf pants are those?
Great info!
My short game was destroyed in one day by hitting off rubber tees at a driving range.
great advice as usual Danny, thanks a million , by the way is Fat Boy Slim in the clubhouse celebrating a hole in one?😂😂😂
This is something I've been working on in my game. You instruction really helps make it clear and easier to  apply.
Another great video Danny, took a little bit of this from your Pete Cowan video, sometimes when you are struggling, you just need to switch off from being too precise, just walk up and hit the ball ! Which as a high handicapper I’ve done a few times on course, and seen a big improvement from some horrible first few holes ha ha. Keep up the great work.
He’s actually helpful
Ben Hogan would have described what Danny calls impulse as the kinetic chain. It made me chuckle when he spoke the word "impulse" as if the term has a specific definition in the golf community that everyone knows about. And then I thought, "I can see, though, how that description, which is open to interpretation, allows people to potentially find something that will work for them. That's actually a good way to teach on YouTube, where there is no interpersonal contact aside from non-visual comments." Take that out of perspective and the video becomes a guy swinging his arm in a goofy way. Danny you should play golf in Hawaii some time!
Danny  I practiced my drives and long irons several times this week, after watching your video half a dozen times. I also played a small course with my pitching wedge just to see if I could get that feel you were trying to teach your father. Well today I had a good day 16 out of 18 drives right down the middle as I started off half swing and built my confidence up. My second shot also gives me issues but I slowed down my swing and followed your steps and all went well. I broke a 100 and if I didn't miss 5 or 6 three or four foot putts I would have been in the low 90's.  Danny Thank you as I know this is only the beginning but I can feel it now when I make a mistake.  I true loyal fan Ralph Staiano
Thank you
This transformed my game I’m well on my way to winning the green jacket next year
Struggling with Driver going straight left. Only got it a month ago. Had a basic set up lesson and now playing with it. Irons are a slight fade which I like. any vids you've done cover this?
Dear Danny! This is a green lesson!! but I would like to ask you do you have a video how to play in strong winds, we have 4 Links courses down here  we I stay ( George South Africa) I play league for my club and it is so difficult to play on these course when the wind blows, it will actually blow your golf trolley over! Can you give some tips please!! 🥰🥰🥰
I understand this. Similar to a kids standing on a swing. As your swinging you dip down and stand up as you hit the top. That swings you higher. Appreciate this tip.
Danny, I just discovered your channel after quite a few years of not playing the game. There was a time when I developed a pretty good golf swing on my own and I didn't even know how i did it. I just figured after a while you get better but thats not entirely true. It was a feel thing for me.(Before Youtube) After seeing your visualization instruction I can now clearly see why I had improved at that time. Fast forward to today its such a great privilege to be able to see your videos and professional instruction for literally no cost to the viewer. It takes alot of time for a novice to learn even a few of these techniques on their own and sadly without proper instruction most average golfers develop horrible bad habits that they never break. Now I can see how a good golf swing is built and I can focus on these key elements to learn as quickly as I possibly could. Thank you so much for your time and help. I will tell my fellow golfers about you and help promote your channel.
Danny, this video really helped me break through my static swing.  I just kept saying "impulse" as I came through my swing and magically my body started to create more thrust that I haven't felt before.  It's amazing how much a simple word or concept can click with your brain as opposed to worrying about how your body should look at impact.  Obviously your posture is immensely important to the golf swing, but these simple words or concepts that you teach really help to feel the swing as opposed to thinking about the swing.  Thanks again for an amazing video!
WHAT are they watching in that house
Casting the club is a common error too
Not to be a nerd but I've never heard "impulse" used in this way. I looked it up and I was correct. Impulse is a mental urge, not a physical action. However, I really like the lesson and I think it will help me.  Thanks.
DM killing it again. ✊🏻   NOONE out there like you bud, you’re on point.
Thanks Danny! A really helpful vision of the golf swing along with straightforward exercises
Hi Danny I watch your videos a lot I love the good work you are doing to help us to reach our goal can you tell me when setting up with a driver what part of the body should the end be pointing at
Love your teaching Danny it’s really improving my game cheers
Thanks Danny , you are one great man
Positive supportive feed back and ideas - another great session = thank you 😀🇨🇦
GREAT  lesson. Really all mental, never heard anything like it. Yes I know  that mechanics too, but                              this is very good and i think it's just what i need.  PROOF: Works with all the clubs                               the bag!        Thank YOU, Danny.
Another great video Danny.  I prefer the word "impetus" to "impulse", but it seems they can be used as synonyms.
Danny Maude is the best video golf instructor ever!
Wonderful practice aid using the alignment stick!
Danny Maude....I Love You...I mean that in the most hetero but authentic way possible....your vidoes have helped my game tremendously. And what's more is they are a joy to watch, you have such a casual, honest and friendly personality that you make us all feel we could just play a match and be friends. Keep up the good work!
So golf is only on "Impulse engines" Scotty?  No engaging the Warp drive?
Or you could call it “up-pulse”
Where is the practice plan? I don’t need a transcript of the video!
Impulse!!!  Just what I was looking for: a word to remember what to do on the putting green. THANKS, Bob Bruce
Brilliant. I have used this method and it has improved my striking no end.
Makes such great sense and so simple to apply to your approach - Thanks Danny
Hi Danny, Cannot thank you enough for this, i was hooking my irons constantly, Now my irons, driver and woods are hitting the fairways 9 times out of 10 ( ok using top tracer ) totally stoked, thanks matey. I spent the best part of 20 minutes just throwing golf balls and then a further 10 mins just swinging the clubs. Worked wonders. 9 holes tonight to make sure it's ingrained in. And the putting tip worked well too, need a lot more practice with that though 🙂
Hey Danny great lesson it was exactly what I needed ... thanks for your advice
Danny - This impulse drill is great. That is exactly what I am missing. Thank you.
Fucken adds
I love this video. I have a problem with early extension. Do you have any advice for this?
Fantastic drills. Keep doing the best videos.
Great video as usual, Thank You.  The practice plan is great and the vid upload was awesome. Every vid helps me get my swing better. Irons are now 1000% better thanks to your info. Driver still needs work but it's getting there.
Another great and easy to understand approach of the golf swing. I like your way of teaching. Watching your videos since 2020 and had the chance to put in practice so many of your tips wich helped me to improve my games. Looking forward for new tips. Thank you so much.
Nice video-but the editing (choppy, jumping camera angles repeatedly, etc) was aggravating.  Don't be afraid to just talk at the camera, and record yourself talking at the camera from one viewpoint, for whole paragraphs  or tens of seconds at a time. It won't get boring-I promise!
Good lesson
Nice golf
Good lesson Daniel thanks
TLDR: IMPULSE
Hahah shut up  98% of all golf players aren’t good you think fucking changing your clubs or whatever you wanna do something about that
I may be wrong but do I need to have impulse when I’m playing golf ⛳️ 🤔
I watched this video yesterday and I play fantastic.  Impulse was missing from my shots.  My husband and I won our Couples Club Championship yesterday!  Thanks Danny! I only watch you lessons. They are so great!⛳️
Every time I watch your videos you are a great teacher. Very informative and clear. I really appreciate the time you put into your videos. I can’t afford to take a lot of lessons and I get so much out of watching and listening to you.  Thank you so much.
With the driver I make a good break, but when I really need to hit I do something different to lose distance. Are there any exercises I can do to improve this shot in a tournament.Thank you in advance for your advice.

Great effort Danny. Working on it!!
Brilliant
Thanks for this Danny, over the season I have improved greatly but still spin out of shots too early. This drill should help me so I'll put it into practice
Great way to illustrate
I know someone who struggles chipping and can play golf fine thanks.
I enjoy your golf videos. They're straight forward, easy to follow,  and you don't go too "deep into the weeds" on the golf swing like some instructors do. I've recommended a number of your videos (namely your chipping videos) to friends and family.
Great drill on putting
thank u danny！
i cut my handi by 5, Danny you'r too good!
Really like the idea of impulse in putting. My putting is missing something and I think it’s impulse. Thanks Danny.
I keep having seizures when I watch this vid. Can’t figure out why 🤔😵‍💫
I just watched a Fred Couples lesson. He says something similar with his easy swing. He said his swing may look easy but the last phase of it he gives it all he can.
Another great video Danny,when im really striking it well and even in the short game i feel the "impulse" in the shaft!
It seems that when I follow your instructions I play better, but I soon go back to my old ways   Causing my score to rise again. I know I need to practice and play more but improvement is slow when playing once a week or less (this year) . Thanks for all the great tips and practice plans I know for a fact they work. Just need to play more!!
Thanks!
Really like this one too Danny. Once again you give us the tools (and solutions) and it's up to us to practice and drill. If we apply that, the results speak for themselves. Thankyou again for all your guidance.
Wow, what a video, you're incredible at describing your point and use very good examples. Will be trying this next time I play, I've only just started and played my first 18 today so hopefully this will help alot
You've absolutely transformed my game Danny! I'm consistently striking the ball now, thanks to your lessons. However, I was fatting the ball every third shot or so. I just hit 10 balls into my net after watching this and applying this technique...10 purely struck balls. Golf is fun again, thanks Danny! I look forward to improving for years to come.
I've watched lots of golf training videos, never have I seen this so well articulated & concisely explained! Thanks again Danny!
Thank you Danny
Love this one.  There have been times  where the ball just seems to lose distance.  Loss of impulse was probably the reason.
Danny, one thing I notice in your swing is your upper right arm stays fairly glued to your chest.  A lot of pros practice and test their swing by placing a glove in their right armpit and keep it there throughout their swing especially with irons.  This teaches several very good things.  It keeps the rotation of the arms and body together, helps flatten the left wrist, keeps alignment of the swing closer to the ideal  and keeps the dynamic of the swing motion easier to control.  A whole lot of good things happen by this simple change.
Great Video, thanks a lot. Very helpful 👏👍
Very useful video, Danny. I realised that I was lacking “impulse” in my putting this week on a change of greens.  The grass was extremely fast and my putting was too slow, leaving the ball short on many occasions. Hopefully, as a result of seeing this video I can put it right.
Luke Donald makes the analogy of how you drive a nail with a hammer that is similar to “impulse” or as I like say a “pop” in the strike
If you’re new here, just go ahead and hit subscribe. Just do it. Follow Danny’s advice on how these methods improve your feel in your swing and do what he suggests. It will change your game for the better. Promise. It definitely improved mine dramatically. Especially with consistency. 👍🏻😎👍🏻
impulse what great information, I do a good job with this on driver, irons and chipping it never occurred to me with the putter! game changer at least it is in my head we'll be impulse-ing with the putter soon!! thank you as always Danny
Danny I just took a putting lesson and my instructor told me not to accelerate at impact but to keep the same tempo on the back and follow through because he said I am too strong...
Thanks Danny, good info
Great job 👍
One of the best golf coaching channels on YouTube. Thanks Danny
Well done Danny 👏
Bedankt
Looks like they’re having a proper good rave up in the clubhouse 🙌😂
Free practice plan doesn’t seem free if I have to give out personal info, like phone number.  Live your videos but….
Hi Danny! I love how you are improving your subscription plans! I have improved SO much by doing your Swing Blueprint practice! I have watched your free videos for a long time and honestly only went to the paid subscription because I figured you should get a bit of pay for all the help you've been to me. When you did an audio comment on my swing it was very helpful! I share your videos with some of my friends and family. My favorite thing about your style of teaching is that you teach us the "feel" of the swing, not the mechanics. Thanks so much for all you do!
Got to give that a go.
I'm shooting in the 80's regularly now.  What you call "impulse"  is to me that feeling of acceleration thru impact.  Even on a 3 ft downhill slider, or a delicate green-side chip with slow overall tempo, I feel there is a moment where the "impulse" peaks.  BTW, better investigate that flashing window in the background; MI5 may be collecting data on your swing tips. 😁
Great drill and THANKS for this good video! Stavros
Thanks for the video. I've been working hard on standing up on my left foot on my follow through, however, I've been hitting my irons thin and my hybrids rolling.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
We call it striking the match.  It takes a quick motion like when you strike a match on a match box.
was there a rave happening at the clubhouse?
Another great video … each one offers a great tip. Keep doing what you’re doing. Thanks.
Hi Danny,  You hit the nail on the head with the putting. That's me all over but I'm about to change my technique thanks to your tips. Stay well 👍
Thanks again Danny.  I remember when I picked up golf seriously over 30 years ago, after playing baseball and fastball for so many years, that impulse in the swing just occurred naturally.  But, 30 years later, I became too too conscious and mechanical when trying to make the perfect golf swing, it is another part I’ve forgotten over time.  You never seize to amaze me how you pinpoint my faults.  Much thanks,,,,aaaagain! Leroy
What an Impulsive Video that makes great sense Danny your describing what I call the snap in our swings…. Great drill with alignment stick to create that Impulse or Snap…
It’s funny i can do it with irons ok, but driver i still wind up with that back foot lean
But it all starts with the LEGS!
Thanks!
Awesome video as always. Thank you for all your instructional videos!!
I've focused a lot on my lead shoulder turn in the backswing but not as much in the downswing and impact.  I will definitely try this.  Liking the idea of your brain knowing where it needs to be which helps the backswing too (give that backswing a destination to go to).  Not sure if it will help me (if I can actually implement it properly) but love the idea and presentation.  Another top notch video from my favourite Youtube golf instructor 👍
Once again, the Maestro of golf breaks it down so well, even an old guy like me can understand!  Thanks Danny!
Perfect!
Already tried with my shot to medium irons. Now my grouping is much better as I get mor consistent strikes which are more online with the target. Nice one Danny
Danny I have a question. With my drive, the ball just goes straight down and left. Same with my hybrids. Do you know what causes this? My irons and my shirt game are really good right now but I’m making pars that seem like birdies because my drives are  40 yards of the tee box. I’m a kid btw I don’t know if this will help you understand why I hit my driver down and left
Danny. This is a stormer of a lesson. Thank you! I'm guessing the early extenders are not getting the timing of the impulse right?
Yep.  Too many people aren’t getting that element of “applying the brakes” through impact. I highly recommend the drill “hit hard, stop quick”. This drill gives you that feeling of “extension” that so many players lack. Look it up. The guys name is Rob Cheney.
We will know everyone who watches your videos next time we're on the course because when they play a bad shot we will hear them say "damn No Impulse"  🙄😆
Great advice
Thanks Danny great explanation/content as always!
One thing I really struggle with, definitely be trying this this afternoon 👍🏻
As always, awesome teaching, thanks buddy
This is simply brilliant!
Hi Danny Really great video. Your analogys are so spot on. Your videos are so good you are in danger of curing the golfing challenged of all their faults. I want hear if you have created a pro out of a 28 handicapper, which I'm sure would be possible if you caught them early enough. Wishing you greater success
Great video.  Never thought about that with my putting.   I've been leaving the long ones short and overcorrecting with longer swing motions.  Thanks for the video
Excellent training!
That’s what was missing from my swing. I managed to work that out and it has added huge distance. Only need to work on which club now. Thanks
Thank you so much Danny! Another excellent instructional video with good exercises. my regular swing deviation on irons, woods and driver is that I come up too early and then don't hit the ball well and Carry lose. I'm going to practice your drills.
I think you just told me how to stop my putting wows, THANKS!
Danny, I have a tendency to “pop up” and sometimes open too much. I do this with driver more but with irons also. How can I incorporate impulse but combat these faults. Thanks for the videos.
I've always suffered from being too controlling. I can hit nice shots but never had as much distance as I thought I should. My favourite way to practice now is to just chuck a ball down, walk up and smash it to a target just as it stops moving. It's amazing how doing that 15 or 20 times can free you up and get you away from thinking about the swing. It's also amazing how accurate I am considering I'm not paying any attention to ball position, stance etc
I couldn’t get my eyes off the club house TV haha. Thank you for the video can’t wait to hit the range
My swing thought has been “tempo” to try and keep my swing speed even but I fail to hit through the ball quite often. Going to replace it with “impulse” moving forward and aim to get my swing to finish high above left shoulder. Thanks Danny.
Great lesson as always Danny.  Love the relatable applications (tossing a ball, sweeping the broom,etc) as they show we can incorporate daily activities into the game to make it more enjoyable. Dr. Bob Rotella in “Make Your Next Shot Your Best Shot” taljs about how great golfers use  right-brain creativity to execute left-brain logic.  Your drills marry well into that process, as the drills are meant to trigger something you already know (left-side) into executing a better swing (right-side).
I’ve been enjoying ur videos for some time, but this one is one of your best !!!!
Thanks Dan
Ads are a pain in the arse !
Danny, you have transformed my game and put a smile on my face. I have been throwing in shanks for years, coming and going and not knowing why.  Understanding your axe move and the turning of the shoulders more just makes the swing so much simpler and leading to a great finish. What you did with Liam from golf mates and his on the course driving lesson was outstanding. Can’t thank you and Liam enough for bringing a bad 12 handicapper back to life and enjoying the game so much again. You explanation of the swing is great to follow. My son who’s 14 has improved too. Cheers and thank you once again
After 40 years the penny has dropped , THANKS Danny.
Your lessons get better and better Danny, thank you!
Thanks for the video!
AYE, I got the Rouge ST Max too ;) Hitting that bugger like 280-300ish.
We’ll see how this goes later this afternoon, very interesting 🤨
Thanks once again for your expertise. Having that in your mind when putting, because that's my weakness of the game.
A better phrase,instead of in time,is in sync,whether irons or driver.When we are ,in sync,we hit the ball crisper and more yardage.I enjoy your videos, thank you for helping us.
Is the clubhouse hosting a rave in the back ground !? Good advice thanks
Brilliant, thanks Danny
Good morning and thank you for your very good advice. Best regards.
I'm actually a non impulse chipper as far as I know, and it is by far the strongest part of my game. I dont flick it, I keep chest and hips almost dead still, and arms go back and forward like a putting motion, Im a 16 hcp and according to Arcos caddie +5.6 hcp short game (or if you dont trust that, basically the majority of my chips within 20 yards are within 6 feet and maybe about 30% I leave a tap in, everyone Ive played with comments on it including my coach).  Danny's videos are fantastic and he is my favourite golf youtuber (maybe tied with Padraig) and has helped me a ton, but I gotta disagree here, I guess there will always be exceptions.   I just like the mechanical movement of my chips, I like practicing hitting a few hundred in a bucket from 5-15 yards, a lot of them go in and nearly all hitting or just past the bucket, so on an actual green or fringe area that will usually be fine as a target spot.   I have tried turning my hips in to it and using that whip and impulse, theres undoubtedly more natural power but I actually dont like that, its difficult to be very accurate, the difference of a yard or two can be rolling past fringe towards the hole, or sticking to that fringe.   With the mechanical motion and my repetitive practice, I know exactly how far Im bringing the club back and I am rarely adjusting the downswing acceleration whatsoever. Of course when I get to 30 yards or beyond, I have to then start loosening up my swing, and that luckily hasnt caused any issues either (a concern in the past may have been confusion over mechanical vs impulse, its fine now).  I will always reconsider amd re-examine what Im doing and I will again after this video and genuinely give it another chance, but I would be surprised if I change it.   Its so simple to me right now and for the last year or so, I am barely even thinking when chipping, and I even look forward to a lot of chip shots (admittedly the simple ones) because I know Im usually gaining a stroke
Another superbly explained and relevant lesson Danny. Wish I could have a one-on-one lesson!!
Love these Sat morning vids, just to have a couple of check points each week is gold.. Been following your advice for a while and almost back to single figures thanks to you.....On that, would love to see one on how to prep for a weekend comp, maybe what you see as a good routine pre round to get ready? I tend to do the technical stuff at the range and try not go to the first with a head full of swing thoughts, but they do creep in sometimes 🙃   If you already have posted a vid like this, please could you link it?   Thanks Danny, your videos are really so helpful and appreciated...  ⛳🏌‍♀🙂
Great video drill, but I was so distracted at the start by the rave in the clubhouse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can not wait to get out and try this great tip
The cropped off putting stroke looks like Snedeker’s pop putting style. Can you do a video about this method?
Thanks as ever. I especially like the putting part. My putt is smooth but never reaches now I know why, can’t wait to try this.
I've had this virus for a long time, already🥴
Thanks Danny, your lessons make sense!
I’m so glad I follow you now. Can’t wait as in October I finally get my new knee then next year I can put all your videos into practice…  might actually break 90 👍🏻
This is very interesting as a way to solve the flip. I really want to try this also with my driving.. thanks Danny.. I think this could be a game changer
Hi Danny, your no nonsense plain common everyday speak is just wonderful.  You are so understandable and clear.  I was taught to play golf 40 years ago and spent plenty in the process. Inconsistent short long short long puts, a hopeless short game, reasonable from 80m but developing through a fade, power fade to wild slice as I progress to my driver with plenty of straight lefts (right hander). I could never understand it let alone begin to address the issues. I retired 2 months ago and have been following your advice and instruction after coming across your channel about 8 weeks ago. My swing has gone well beyond where 10 years of golf and instruction through the 80s and 90s had left me and that is all because of your channel. If the share market improves I’m booking some direct tuition. I may even fly over for it.  Thanks for what you do.
Brilliant Danny thanks for the tips
As a person your fathers age or close enough I sometimes wonder if it's lack of impulse or lack of pulse. 😂 Another great lesson/reminder for us all. With every shot we need to know what we intend.
Cheers Danny
Well done Danny never thought about that when putting also 👍
This is uncanny, I just got back from holiday and the wife was laughing at me doing the "sweep the broom" drill on the veranda. It made me realise that I had been spinning out of my shots and that's why I'm still coming over the top with no power. I love the way you simplify this, can't wait to get back out there!
I love your Facebook live chats!
Love this …. You communicate your ideas and techniques beautifully.  👏👏👍🏻
Great video Danny.
Thanks Danny. My pro had me doing that alignment stick drag motion but I didn't understand why he wanted me to do it. This puts it all in context. I'm looking forward to trying the putting drill with the tee pegs too!
Great Demo of las of conservation of Momentum and of Energy according Newton.
Bit early for someone to be having a rave in the building behind? :D
No impulse with putting is so me. Either so short or miles long. Thanks Danny will practice that
Cheers Danny always great information on the swing
Dragging the alignment stick to create space is genius
Disco in the clubhouse 😂😂
Clear and easy to follow, as always. Thank Danny
Great vid. Adding impulse has transformed my game
Great tips there Danny thanks for the video!
Anyone else notice the party lights?
This is going to help me so much with my irons.
