Adams videos saved my life when i was younger i can only hope he's life goes well and that he gets better
A third of this video aged like milk
Albert!
16:04 Honey sponsor
What about stampy cat
Op
Shadow cadets will rise
i love lizzie's content
Ok now 3 years later just lizzie having a yap session
I love how skyedoesminecraft is the most literal name in all of history lmao
skydoesminecraft was my entire childhood, right next to Vanossgaming, but skydoeseverything will always hold a special place in my heart; it was because of Adam and his friends that made me want to grow up to be an animator or content creator, to make others smile and laugh just as he had while I was growing up.
sky's mere existence here made this video age like milk
My favorite of them all is DanTDM.
i've watched lizzie's videos since i was a kid, really happy to see her still going strong. coming back to this video just to appreciate dan and lizzie's consistency in maintaining an uncontroversial, wholesome side of gaming that we all need but never get enough of.
13:20 i cant take the guy saying "DAN THE MAN!!!" seriously without thinking of the Dan the man mobile game (Context, made by the same guys who made jetpack joyride)
I don't think people realize how impressive Lizzie is, like her mindset is soo healthy. Not that the other 2 aren't but, you can sense some doubt in what they say, but with Lizzie, she's so confident and can acknowledge things quickly. It's insane how consistent she is too??
I love Lizzie so much!!!! Proud og fan 🤩🤩
I love Lizzie so much!!!! Proud og fan 🤩🤩
Lizzy and Dan were my childhood, now they're my exam stress relief videos <3
4:50 to 5:11 pre malone overused joke
Ayo post Malone lived in a Minecraft house lmao!!!!
Dan is my favourite YouTube and my childhood 😂❤
HEARTBROKEN that Tobuscus didn’t make an appearance
🫶🫶
LDshadowlady was like my introduction into modded minecraft
Love lizzie she's so chaotic it always makes me laugh.
DanTDM and LDshadowlday was my childhood, and I still watch Lizzie until today
honestly lizzies prime is later than it’s made to seem, her most viewed series/videos are one life and the 100 days minecraft which i think came out around the time this interview was posted
Holy crap lizzie has such a healthy outlook on youtube, yet another reason shes amazing
sky and Dan the goat ong
Ldshadowlady and DanTDM carried my childhood
They will never get boring for me
Wait Scotland has a minecraft server
This trio right here was like a second parent to me when I was younger❤
Lizzie is such a Queen 🩷🤍💙
3:17
I love the OG YouTubers tons more. I mean, all the new ones like Ranboo, TommyInnit, and Dream are cool too, but I think Dan and Lizzie's sense of humor are funnier. The newer YouTuber's sense of humore is all LOUD and SWEARING, but the OGs I just LOVE soooo much!
Cringing at Sky comparing himself/ putting himself on the same level as pewdiepie
where popularmmos
The Avengers of Youtube Minecraft
If I had never found out about YouTube and the legends I would've never knew that a single person can change the entire way you look at life and be such a big part of your life
Man i remember littlelizard and littleturtle
popularmmos?
Anthony: “i don’t need to have lived most of last year” me, watching this video in 2024: 🫡 edit: ik it was made years ago this was just funny given how his year went last year
I neeeed one with aphmau, i wanna know so much, like how and when she decided to change up her content, will she ever go back, how did she do minecraft diaries cause it mustve been so much work, i just adore her
You should interview ZachScott
I watched Lizzie ten years ago and I still watch Lizzie today!!
My biggest flex in life is that I share a birthday with Dantdm 💙🩵🤍
8:55
It’s such a real shame that Sky ended up being a real pos. He was a huge part of my childhood watching his videos. His Cops and Robbers videos were my favourites
the thing with dantdm is his content and humour evolved and grew up with his audience, my humour was perfect with dantdm back in 2016 or 2014 and now it’s still the perfect fit in 2023
I’m glad Dan is still doing great to this day And sky …. “We don’t talk about that area”
SKYDOESMINECRAFT❤️❤️
I don’t know why but I can totally see Dan and Anthony becoming pretty good friends
I’m now almost in 8th grade and have been watching Lizzie  Since 3rd grade and I still love her ahahhaha
Adam is still alive?
forever and always watching ldshadowlady idc how old i am
OG minecrafters >>>>>>> modern Minecrafters
I HAVENT SEEN SKYDOESMINECRAFT IN SO LONG
LDshadowlady was and will always be my childhood. I still watch every video she posts and the time she didn’t post for 5 months I felt really down. Glad she’s back ❤❤
Dan and Lizzie carried my childhood, fun fact, 9 years ago I started watching YouTube, and Dan was my first YouTube video
accidentally picking 2 real stinkers on this one huh. lizzie is cool tho
Sky may have gone down the toilet but his content and all the people he collaborated with really made me smile  Truthfully i still watch his videos for the memories
god damn this guy annoys me
UnspeakableGaming?
Love Lizzie, I’m a few days older than her.  My daughter who is 9, loves watching Her videos and we watch them together, we watch Joel’s channel too, Gem , Jimmy and Scott, loving the Secret Life series right now.
I learned a few swear words from sky does Minecraft when I was a kid
Why most minecraft og are british
This aged well
Oh shit I miss squid 🥹
Not to be one of those people but Stampy is also a legendary OG Minecrafter
This video fr almost made me cry, it’s so weird how long it’s been since these guys just showed up in my life 😭🙏🏻
Yeah, but sky just quit now he’s just making music.
This didnt age well.
Love all these mincreft youtubers their my childhood
I’m so happy Lizzie got on here
Most all Minecraft fans have atleast watched and idolised one of these YouTubers, I'm a shadow cadet lol
I love them all still
Honestly I’ve never stopped watching Dan or Lizzie I just carry on watching them and, that it just makes me happy
Hey, if you still read comments from this, would love if you did one with Hermitcraft members. They are the longest running content creator server, it would be cool to their thoughts on things.
This is wild cause.. I just started watching LDShadowLady and I had NO idea she was an OG :0 and I’ve been aroundddd for minecraft OGs I started playing MC in 2011 because of watching YouTubers play
LIZZIE i have been there since the beginning always a die hard fan been watching since elementary school and i am 20 now i will always tune in on the newest upload i always get so excited when i see a new video!!!
You should make a video with Aphmau. She's one of the ogs
To the people saying Dan fell off I honestly (controversial opinion) liek him more now chill slow pasted content it’s a nice break from all the stuff now
Didn't know the other 2 but ye sky and all of his gang id watch those guys so much along with smosj and rwj, such good memories, I would just watch all those guys videos all day and night that I had the chance, now I can't stand being on YouTube I hate almost all the content except like some of the smosh pit stuff and Fitz
I am a little late to the pary=ty..... lol. I love all 3. They basically raised me and gave me love for minecraft and developed what minecraft really is when you have some passion behind it.
mincraft is the best game ever
skye does minecraft 😳
Dan an lizzie were my childhood, i still adore watching their videos to this day and it makes me really happy knowing i grew up with such amazing youtubers!!
I wish stampy was on this
yo thank dude u made it u even had an interview with skythekidrs
11:58 tommyinnit on the left side screen
Knowing that Adam lived with Post Malone makes a lot of sense. Both seem like really nice & fun with a pinch of unhinged-ness. And of course a load of creativity from both of them
What about kurtjmac / far lands or bust? He wasn’t as big & still isn’t, but he’s doing such a cool thing!!!
DANTDM is so awesome man, I just love that guy ;)))))
Great to see LDShadowLady still kicking it
5:48
w- wait- DAN IS YOUNGER THAN ANTHONY 😥 this man doesn't age..
Yooo shout out Albert
Lizzie has no idea what she’s done for me. I wouldn’t be alive without her
just me who thinks that they forgot about stampycat
unfortunate that Pat (and maybe even Jen) werent in this video.         very.
I remember watching sky when youtube had a different channel layout
Where is stampy
Squid 🦑
Just hearing sky was so nostalgic, but can I just ask 21:00 what happened to Melvin because in one of Skyes videos pacifically I think it was a do not laugh. I remember him saying to Max be lucky you don’t have Melvin. Because he was smart, and would check if sky was asleep and steal his food right off the counter. Although I do feel like I know what happened I’m just curious by Albert is cute too
no stampy = no watch
I wish he couldve interviewed Bashurverse may he Rest in Peace
pat...
these videos make my heart raced
PopularMMOs and Gaming with Jen are my legends in Minecraft
I didnt get into minecraft until later in life so I did not grow up with these people, truthfully I only had heard of Lizzie because of Grian and she is an absolute gem.
Should’ve added stampy long nose he’s an og
Where is yogscast, captainsparklez and ssundee yo
21:01 ALBERT
Dan's younger than my sister Dam
Forgot about stumpy cat
They are really hardworking and awesome youtubers❤😊
Just hearing Skys voice and knowing all he has done just breaks my heart. RIP a legend even though hes not dead but the person we all thought he was did.
man i watched dan tdm for 8 years i loved dantdm when my dad heard his intro my dad would yell dan here
I absolutely love Lizzie. I have phases and usually about a year later, I end up returning back to them for another while. Minecraft is one of those phases. I loved Lizzie, I've binged all of her SMPs from Crazycraft, Funcraft and Shadowcraft to One Life, Last Life and Empires SMP. She has had a big impact on my childhood and now that I started rewatching her content, I still understand why. I hope she stays true to herself, if she quits Minecraft or YouTube in general to focus on her life with Joel, I will support her no matter what.
I will never stop watching Ldshadowlady, it’s been about 9 years
Where’s stampy 😢
"A sense of purpose" ouch
Man skydoesminecraft sounds just like my dad with the things he did fr
Sky was likehe was on weed thia wntire time
Crazy seeing Adam here. I just found out randomly that He got married. Good to see that he's doing well. Hope he has more songs.
did uh.... did anyone know of the controversy and insanity sky did and was in here? o__o
WHERE THE HELL IS STAMPYLONGHEAD!?!?
sky is just as unhinged as ever. warms my heart!!
Man i thought stampylongnose would have been showed
no STAMPY??? , iballistic squid, captain sparkles, popularmmos, sundee. love dan and adam i watched them religiously too
I’m disappointed that there’s no stampy
I dont see stampy
This is like YouTuber therapy
I watched Sky all the time, he was definitely my favorite minecraft YouTuber as a kid. Really sucks that he turned out to be such a horrible person :/
When he said that about courgettes two thoughts appeared in my brain they either wanted her to sign there car or their wife, either way she would have signed a prized possession.
Seeing this is my recommended after knowing what Sky did is just…
I’m sorry I love all of these YouTubers but where is stampy 😢
0:47 what is that fucking music I love it
Bro needs to interview stampy!!
Adam is something else 😭  "DIS IS ALBERT."
so cool to see all my childhood youtubers all in the same video
I would love to see if He can make a video with the Vanoss crew... I think it would be one of the most chaotic yet fun content ever❤
Nostalgia ❤
Populomous 😔 I wish he was there
Oh my god PLEASE do a Stampy video he was my childhood and the entire reason I started playing Minecraft now I get to enjoy it with my friends thanks to him :’)
Where’s popularmmos?
Oh no bro didn’t you abuse your wife.
0:32. You ain’t gotta do Dan like that with the hardcore clip
I am so sad sky stop doings vid he still have got the goffy n funny thing
Yes.
Bajan Canadian, anyone?
DUDE. SKY'S PERIOD WAS SUCH A FUCKING BLUR TO ME THAT I FORGOT HE LIVED WITH FUCKING POST MALONE AT ONE POINT. I USED TO THINK WHY THE F IS THIS GUY THERE AND THEN SUDDENLY BAM. OOOOOO I FALL APARTTTT.
I've been involved in the MC community since mid-2011 and this is the first I've ever heard of LDShadowLady. Even then, the other two have been on top only a little bit after the game started to gain some serious popularity. To me, the real OGs were The Yogscast (Which across the board, I have not seen lots of people list as OG which absolutely baffles me) CaptainSparklez, Cupquake, MinecraftChick (Lydia Winters), Stampy (Even though I haven't really watched his videos), AntVenom, SlyFoxHound, paulsoaresjr, etc.  Maybe I'm just blind, maybe my memory has left me (12 years is a long time after all...) but I feel like the history of MC on YouTube runs a little deeper than what was going on during 2013-14 and beyond.
When i was watching Smosh i always thought that DanTDM was Anthony 😂 (its years ago)
sky does minecraft was my childhood and i still support him whatever he is doing and i wish him the best because his videos just gave me so much joy and laughter.
i wonder what the zucchini was used for...
This is cool 🎉🎉
You forgot Stampy
wheres popular mmos lol
Why’s stampy not I’m this ,he’s a huge og
R.I.p popluarmmos
It's very disappointing that one of my childhood heroes isn't a good person, somedays I just wanna go back a few years and watch everything again.
Really sad to see Adam honestly. So many great memories of watching his videos. To see him still in the content creation space knowing he is probably still using and abusing the people around him is heartbreaking.
The videos from SkyDoesMinecraft inspired me to download and purchase Minecraft. I wanted to experience the creativity and imagination that he brought to his gameplay. His videos were a significant part of my childhood.
Dan not having anyone to play with and turning npc's into characters is the saddest and best thing ever
surprised sky was included
Dan AND LDshadowlady in the thumbnail??? CLICK 😈😈
You can just tell how unstable Sky is, really is a shame...
I have never heard of shadowlady.... Thats all I wanted to say I will not be watching her I just wanted to say I've never heard of her.
Dan and Lizzie are cool but sky didn't quite age so well
Yess thank you Dan
Bro I feel all the disappointment from the people that grew up watching SkyDoesMinecraft.
ALBERT 21:00
omg take me back to the days, i was probably 8 watching smosh sky yogcast dashie etc... truly teh golden era imo
this video aged poorly for one of these creators.
LDshadowlady was my jam back when I was a kid
I think it's interesting that all of them used characters and immersion to grab our attention as kids
Your missing SGC Barbarian, AviatorGaming, Little Lizzard, Tiny Turtle those mfs where my childhood
SkyDoesMinecraft seems to be entitled and egotistical.
Crazy how I learned English through dan
Bro spent a day with the GOATS
LDSHADOW LADY STAYS 🔛🔝
Super happy to see Lizzie here. I only started following her a year or so ago when I watched the Afterlife series.
stampy <3
i went to both of dans tours and can confirm i’ve been around for many, many years <3
SkyDoesMinecraft has the energy that he went insane, bounced back from being insane, and is now about to go insane again.
Love how much Adam has turned his life around, glad to see him better
it be cool to see SSundee and Mrcrainer together on Anthony Padilla channel.
those people raised me
Seeing Adam in this video hurts after hearing what he did…
Never watched Dan, but I watched Antvenom for years.
It would have been so interesting to see this video with Aphmau, her content has completely changed to fit a much younger demographic and from the standpoint of her old demographic it was/is so weird to see, but now she is doing better than she ever was.
It’s crazy because I watched a ton of Minecraft YouTubers back in the day but I never watched Dan and i don’t even know how because apparently he was huge
one with Aphmau would be cool
you didn't spent a day with og Minecraft yt you my friend spent a day with LEGENDS
This just randomly came into my recommended
You NEED to interview ZackScottGames.
Will you some day make a video with christians?
Man I wish Stampy was in the podcast 10/10
DanTDM has been my favorite YouTuber for eight years straight. I’ve been watching him since I was four.
Lizzie I love your videos and i always watch it and evenre watch it
Im going to be Honest with you I have never even heard of SkyDoesMinecraft or LDShadowLady LMFAO
I want him to do a video with only minecraft redstoners like mumbo jumbo
Bro ldshadowlady brings me back to when I was 6 and 7 years old same with dantdm
It is sad that PopularMMOs wasn't in this :(
I love ld but not in a weird way🌺
stampy
Where is pat/Jen and stampy
Makes me happy to see sky
Talk to Jen from PopularMMO’s
i love you dan <3
u should have stampvcat come on
Can Dan get his whole “ I spent a day with” vid
Omg my FAv YouTuber is in this video LDASchadowLady  I love her vids
Honestly even after all that's happened, it's still nice to see Sky  Edit: I retract this statement
Talking to "OG Minecrafters" and he didn't even interview Etho...
Ldshadowlady is OG? Thought she was just joels girlfriend who plays mc?
Rip tencho
ssundee, bajan canadian, jerome, vikk.
2 of these youtubers built up my personality like sky gives me my humor and dan is why i can be calm in most situations
I personally enjoyed Dan's and Lizzie's videos the most, I don't know why, but they always had that slight "homemade" and "hand-crafted" feel to them, which were always quite calming in contrast to many others during the Golden Age. Or maybe it's because they were British, I honestly don't know.
I feel so old dammm
Adam should create a new channel called SkyDoesJailTime
8:17 Bro was watching the wrong stream 💀
Would love it if you did a "spent a day with Hermitcraft" <3 <3
I remember watching both Lizzie and Sky when I was younger and I'm glad that Lizzie is still around and even if she isn't always wholesome she isn't anything close to what Sky became in the end.
You didn’t get Stampy???
uhoh... Sky - well uh... Im glad LD and Dan are doing well:)
I remember, so vividly watching Sky as a kid. Everything was so funny, still is, honestly. When I’m sad I will still go back to it.   Just the primal childlike joy..  With Dan I never really watched him activity but I remember being enthralled when I did.  And Lizzie her and Joel are so precious and I’m overjoyed that everyone had been or still is a creator.  It’s a genuine thank you to all three of the OG’s
captain sparkles?
Missed Sky so much, broke my heart to see him go overall. BUDDERRRRRRRRR and I am an adult, still following on every adventure recruits!
Man this video came along my feed and the nostalgia… dan sky and LD made my childhood. Waking up and watching dantdm and mod showcases from sky. The things I would do to go back to that era
skydoesminecraft 🥹🥹🥹😁😁😁😁
Adam is just so chaotic in this whole video, I love it
He should do POPULARMMOS big part of my childhood
@AnthonyPadilla make a separate video on Dantdm. He was my childhood and want to know his backstory and I owe my childhood to dantdm
Lizzie is still the best thing to happen to minecraft youtube ^-^
Dantdm was my childhood and I still watch him to this day I am so grateful for that.
Would be cool for you to also talk to the yogscast, Lewis or Simon. They were truly the ones who made Minecraft what it is on YouTube. All of the “role play” type stuff, started with them.
I to be honest really wanted one of them to be Stampylongnose the og Minecraft YouTuber
When I saw Dantdm, I was over the roof. He is my childhood😭 I watched him when I was 4, and now I'm 13 and still watching him. He grew alot, I love you, Dan❤
If you do this again with other og minecrafters, I would love to see you interview Ssundee. I know he was apart of team crafted and it would be fun to see him in your video.
I need Anthony to try and get Stampy to do something like this
The real OGs are pat and Jen from popularmmos
Omg dan was my childhood I loved him so much
This just popped up for me and I’m sorry Dan but I didn’t grow up with you. But Lizzy and Sky I did. We’ll sort of. My og mc creators were actually IBallisticSquid and StampyCat. As well as Ssundee and Cranier. But Sky came along not to long after, I found him very shortly after I found Aphmau. Then I found lizzy. To this day I await an update on Lizzie’s channel. I get so excited when I see one is up as well. That intro will forever make me smile. I now watch (mc wise): Lizzy, Joel (smallishbeans), Max and Ross. I may not watch or look up to sky anymore but I will forever love Max and Ross. And be so greatful for these people that sky met and let be in his videos.  Sky and the crew got me through some dark times. Moving and getting into a new school wasn’t easy for me. Lizzy, Joel, Max and Ross help me get through day to day life. And the OG 4, well they helped me get through living at my grandparents wile my mother was in the hospital. All of the mc creators I’ve watched will hold a special place in my heart.  Thank you to all of you. And especially to all the og’s out there.  P.s. Dan, sorry I missed out. I do watch your videos every once and a wile and I am of course subscribed. I do feel bad for not giving you more of the MC love I have for the others. And that’s because I knew who you were even in my child hood. I just was stuck watching others and living in my own bubble that I didn’t wanna share it with anyone else. I have seen some of your old vids on your channel, your amazing and that’s why I regret not giving it a try. Again, just like the others, keep doing what your doing. Your amazing
Oh no
My biggest flex is that I’ve been watching Lizzie since before crazycraft and never stopped watching
I’d love to see one of these with Ihascupquake
He should make a part 2 of these where it has aphmau and stampy and others
Sky being a bad person still hurts.. he brought me so much happiness and was basically my introduction to YouTube as a whole, cops and robber's will always have a special place in my heart even though everything I seen about him hurts deep down.   And Sky if you see this I'm not much like Twitter I'd love to see you return to making videos (doesn't haft to be Minecraft feel free to rebrand) but first and foremost many apologies to everyone will be needed and it will take time and not just half ass apologies true ones because if you don't really mean it I wouldn't feel right ever watching.
The first episode of Skydoesminecraft was on my birthday
U guys remember that time when Lizzie swore on rats smp
Not me coming back to this video whenever I forget what folks call zucchini in the UK..
Just killed a woman feeling Magical
what about popularmmos???
was stampycat not one?
Umm stampylonghead???
16:00 hittin me with a dose of high school
I love Lizzie so freaking much, She's one of my all time favorites and ive been with ehr for years now
I wish you could’ve done techno
man i loved when sky did the prinson vidoes
God i miss sky. His try not to laugh, i miss it all, i miss the glory days
This dude really forgot stampy the most LEGENDARY MINECRAFT YOUTUBER
Bro i've been watching dan since i was 8 years old..... Im now 18 almost 19  *ehem* use honey ive had it for the longest time since mrbeast was still in college ive saved a frick ton of mooney
Adam is a woman beater, he shouldn't be platformed. He clearly hasn't changed.
Lizzy, DanTDM, Aphmau, StacyPlays and Little Lizard were my childhood
YouTubers like Dan, Sky (ssundee, capt sparkles, etc,) made our childhoods.
Part 2 should be Stampy, Popularmmos and Aphmau
I understand why you would get sky but he has hurt so many people
I hated seeing sky man made my childhood and broke it down  To the people who don't know what he did, good don't look into
I never thought me writing "I use to watch your channel all the time when I was younger" could have been a problem. thing is I forget to mention i still watch them-
Anthony reminds me of apple juice and idk why
Can we appreciate the fact that dan used to do 2 vids every day nowadays u get lucky if you find a youtuber that does 1vid a day
STAMPY NEEDS TO BE ON HERE!!!! >:D
YO WHY IS LIZZIE IN THE BACKROOMS?!?!?!?
You*d think that after the controversy around sky, he wouldnt show his face or even do ANY content wether that being music or mc,
I LOVE YOU BUDDER FREDDY! Hey, didn't you abuse your wife?
watching sky made me cringe. it's just he doesn't know when to joke and when to be real. instead of talking about something difficult, he just deflects or makes a joke out of it. gave me the vibe that he still isn't healthy.
Oh this is a year old 😆
LDSHADOWLADYYYY!!
If i were to add a YouTuber, SSundee.
One day, I hope to be the one sitting in the other chair. I have this amazing opportunity with my thousand subscribers, where I can post a video and know that I have subscribers that might watch it. It's part motivation, and part headstart.
This didn't age well with what sky was exposed about. Yikes
There's 4 childhood legends in this video and one has retired from funny videos and started podcasts
If Anthony made a podcast i would def listen to it
Spend a day with JeromeAsf
yooo its that washed up youtuber NetNobody
The only one missing is popularMMOS
2 out of 3 brits. Good job.
DanTDM was one of the first creators I watched on youtube- I was never allowed on youtube and one day my family started watching Minecraft together so I miss dantdm even though now I watch LDShadowLady and other people but its still nostolgic
Dam. Was hoping to see Bajan Canadian 🇨🇦🖤
I actually remember being soo into Trauraus (?) and Dan when in like 8th grade
I love that skydoesmincraft got an interview with Anthony, I remember a while back he talked about when he was in a bad place, he watched Smosh to cheer him up YEARS back, and you can see how excited he got was when he was introduced
you should do a thing where you spend a day with gta creators, and people from FiveM, in the gta roleplay community
I loved Adam, sucks what he’s done. Can’t look at him the same anymore
can you do 1 with dantdm  and stamp cat
15:28 when i fist saw this i was like “uhhhhhmm…. ok” and then i started dieing of laughter
Where is captain sparkles
What about tobygames
w all 3 legendary youtubers
I love how Anthony is so down to earth and doesn’t really act like he use to be 1/2 of the most popular YouTube channel and one of the reasons it’s so big 😂
I think you forgot about stampy
So apparently sky bullied everyone into recording “perfect” vids for their channels and apparently got in trouble for doing what I’ll call something naughty with a minor. What a fall from grace.
i was never allowed to watch sky because they cursed 😭 but i really appreciate their confidence & determination. i watched a documentary on their career, and life. they've been through so much, and i wish them the best in their music career. if i don't hear those minecraft bars on my radio i will be very disappointed.
no joke when my little sister was first brought home from the hospital after being born i was watching dantdm play fnaf 4 😭😭
I kinda wished stamps was in this that man shaped my life.
Is miss og YouTube it was so much better and more fun
watching dans horror maps as a kid felt like a fever dream and I loved it
Man, sky fell off hard.
The way he just laughed at sky saying he thinks he can get 5 billion views on his music 💀
One of his guests shouts out Anthony padillia consistently Anthony: Oh sh*t I was not expecting that. I mean cmon it happens every time. Honestly it could just be a running joke.
A sit down with the rise and fall of the creatures would be a good episode. Those were my OG minecrafters
Ha 25 billion views is nothing only true OGs can get up to the 4 trillion view mark!
he spelled Trayaurus wrong :(
I was so happy Dantdm/Dan was here, Dan created my whole childhood, and even as I'm a teenager now I still watch his video as he still feels great to watch
Why isn't popularmmos here i miss them their my childhood:(
I don't remember really watching Lizzie or Sky but Dan has been my favorite YouTuber since I was 8 or 9, his videos have helped me through so much
We definitly need a part 2 of og minecrafter
1:16 empires clip? 👀     I never really watched Minecraft as a younger kid, I wasn’t really allowed. I recently got interested in Lizzie’s content from ALSMP though & have been watching her & a bunch of the other ALSMP members since around February-March 2022. They’ve honestly become an important part of my interest & I wish I had watched them sooner. :,)
I'm so glad you interviewed Dan I love him! He literally raised me
I like how Dantdm has better recording quality than the entire hollywood industry
sky fell off proper…
You should do Stampy
I know I’m very late but I remember watching Lizzie and Dan a few years ago, I LOVED THEM. I would watch their videos every single day, and now that I see this I’m going to start watching them again. After hearing what Lizzie said it made me cry. 14:11
Why not popularMMOs
Poor sky
You guys do know that this is probably the last time we are going to be ever see Sky right?His last video was posted is June 30 2021.This video was posted on Jul 8 2021.I hope he puts out music.😢😢😢😢😢😢.I want to see SkyDoesEverything back.
Yup. A lot of those comments did not age well.
Look at Lizzie. She's perfect in every way ❤
DANTDM!!! LIZZE!!!
Let’s all be honest we are only here for Dan
Dan and lizze was my childhood and that will never change and im so happy they were apart of it
10:58 I love how Dan and Lizzie give really special moments that they love and cherish, and then Adam’s just talking about a Lamborghini
Sky goes crazy I love you😂
I remember watching dans lost island series on the daily
The moving part makes so sense there is only one channel where I never stopped watching and that was vanoss
Stampy shouldve been here
Nice
I would love to see dan till 2030, but its his life.
You should interview Minecraft Roleplayers next, like Samgladiator, Aphmau and others!
As bad as sky has gotten over the years, he really defined parts of my childhood w his personas and definitely his music taste. No surprise he's gone into the music business bc he always had the most fantastic soundtracks to his videos. I hope he can get some therapy and come put on top fr, some people can't handle fame
SO WHOLESOME MAN!!!
I loveeee lizzy🙃🙂🙃🙂
Lizzie, I will always be watching your videos. Also I remember watching the vid where the “I’m a piece of bacon!!“ clip came from!
i play minecraft on my phone and nintendo switch and ps4 and ps4 is tu14 one of the old versions
Anthony Should have done stampylongnose
I'm so glad that Dan and lizzy were added I'd say the same for sky but yea... .
Does anybody thinks ssundee should be on the list or is it just me?
I well always love sky, hes my childhood. I know hes done bad things but i cant be mad about it because hes my childhood and he made me who i am❤❤❤❤
You want og? Try tiny turtle and littlelizard
I love this video. It was my childhood. BUT WHERES THE CAPTAIN SPARKLEZ
Only dan didn't comment?
they are my childhood TBH
Couldn't get Stampy, ay?
Why the hell would you spend a day with sky he’s a horrible person
Next video: "I spent a night with your mom"
You should have Lizzie on for her own day
Lizzie bought me closer to lots of my friend after discovering we both watch her channel and we just sit and watch shadowcraft for hours just chatting about fav series and and videos!
It’s sad watching this now with Adam because it seemed like he was an awesome person and I grew up with him and the way things happened is just like damn. But you could also see his downfall.
21:00 best moment
I lover sky so much as a kid. He was like a father figure to me. I'm sad knowing he's not as great as a guy as we thought he was :/
19:30 I feel like asher’s face reveal would get lots of views if he decides to reveal his face when he’s 12-13
Coming back to this a year later it’d be interesting if we got some Hermitcraft members. I’d especially love to see Etho, Grian, and Scar on here
Could you please do a video with stampy? he was my childhood!
ﾠ
JOEY GRACEFFA IS A OG MINECRAFTER
Adam is still so disgusting bro. Can’t believing I ever liked his content.
I remember when ksi and sky were beefing, it was like my childhood we’re fighting it was pretty sad
They all deserve There fame
I’ll always be watching ldshadowlady  Soooooo many bids
Ok, does anyone know just how many holes are in this guys ceiling?
oh god sky is here
Was I the only one looking for Stampy?
1 like = 1 OG minecraft viewer
I have to know. Did you ask stampy or not?
you need to get ssundee in this series
Man, I missed the old Sky videos, but I'm glad he's doing what he loves and he's happy. Also, glad to know he's incredibly insane as always XD
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😎😎😎😎😎🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰🥰🥰🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
My mom has a crush on dantdm
I now need a “I spent a day with ldshadolady”
15:22 he did not got this
There’s a strange feeling I get reading old comments when Sky wasn’t called out, and checking the replies to see people going “um..” and “this aged like milk”
Adam before he became mentally unstable
So sad seeing Adam fall off
I watched Lizzie (LDShadowlady) since I was in elementary. She was just college then. Now I'm in my 4th year of college and Lizzie is already married. How time flies.
I honestly will never stop watching DanTDM, I could even rewatch all his videos xD
Ngl these are ledgendafy but I watched stamps more than sky
i’m still watching lizzie! her content is still so entertaining for me! she’s always been my fav
Dude Sky was my childhood. They were so Intertaning and I love the videos where they made voices for the animals and villagers. I miss the old days.
DanTDM and Stampy were my favorite minecraft youtubers
Lizzie’s pure enjoyment and passion for making her videos is so sweet… I wish more creators these days were like her
i love ldshadowlaxy
Anthony should do a vid with pat/ Popularmmos
Latter Day Saints hadowlady
We’re captain sparkles?
I don’t care about anything that’s happened with sky hes still awesome n funny🤣
I wish there was Stampy on this he was one of the best
Miss the old days
Dan and Lizzie were my childhood and they were mainly the reason I got into Minecraft and made friends that also loved them which made me happy as a child because I had them to look up to when I had bad days and they always made me smile and laugh.
Adam is undoubtedly a hilarious creator, even in this, his moments make me laugh. It's truly tragic that he happened to be a horrible person, but the memories he gave us are still something we will always remember. I hope he becomes better as a person and treats others properly in his own private life.
I've been watching dan since i was 3
When I think og minecraft youtubers, I think of stampy or the yogscast honestly
I'd love to see an interview with Little Kelly and Little Carly. They're also OG Minecrafters and made the childhoods of kids who preferred to see role play stuff, it was super cute!
Bro if you can shoulda gotten PopularMMOS
whos the woman?
Botanically speaking, a zucchini (a type of squash) is definitely a fruit. 8:05
I still watch both Lizzie and Dan their videos are fun and are quite comforting to me :D
Kinda miss old YouTube where it was special when people edited the videos
So grateful for Dan, he forever changed my life with his minecraft videos and really any game he played. I remember in his peak when I went to his world tour show and absolutely loved it, even got a high five! I was so intrigued by how he could play games for a living, I even had him as my biggest inspiration when I had to write an essay in the final exam in 4th grade. I still love playing games and even started my channel a bit. Thanks Dan.
I started watching LDshadowlady when she started the One life videos. My friends where over and they told me about her
Would've loved to see Captainsparklez instead of Sky but OH WELL !
You should make a video of popular YouTubers who started in the 2000s and are still popular till this day you could host yourself 😉
one of the first things i learned to write was LDShadowLady (when i was like 4 or 5) so i didnt need my mum to search her up for me lol
11:18 we all know his lowest point in his career. KSI fucking minced him
heres a teir list of my fav ytbers 1ST DANTDM 2ND strangerthings videos 3RD sssniper wolf 4TH (ehhh maybe AnthonkyPadilla)        not really i just dont wanna make  u sad)
My favourite videos of DanTDM are his Minecraft Mod Adventures and if I’m not wrong, there is a playlist with 55 videos in it.
These people are my fricken childhood
Nice to see some classic youtubers especially Adam
Looking back this video.. I just notice Lizzie's sub count decreased by 6 million.. oh no
man i wish there was stampy in this
Lmao, Sky made Dan blow up and Dan has 16 more million subs
u should honnor technoblade
U should do the some of the best art youtubers like morhia Elizabeth jacky aka nerdy crafter and ace of clay please
How about legendary old YouTubers Smosh' SSundee' canadian
man i wanna make some videos but my pc cant handle it :(
Ive watched ldshadowlady and some of dan’s videos since middle school and I still watch them in college. I literally don’t care. They were AMAZING!!
there was a battle between the  Brazilian youtubers rezendeevil and AuthenticGames in 2012 - 2013 and it was about who uploaded the most videos in a day believe it or not they ended up uploading 7 videos a day.
I've realized that the OG Minecrafters I watched like LDShadowLady and DanTDM even have an impact on me now with the fact that i've always wanted dyed hiar and now i'm old enough to where i have blue hair. idk, just an observation :)
I really love how lizzie this whole time it like, yeah my life is great 👍  (This was a joke i dont know everything bout lizzies life)
I would love to see an entire episode dedicated to just Dan
Now we need Grian
Watching this just makes me think of other "OG" Minecrafters that just aren't English speakers.  Like I'm German and grew up German, so the OG Minecrater I know? "Gronkh". Hundreds to thousands of episodes of a Minecraft Let's Play, starting in 2010 (earlier than Sky!). It'd be cool to see Interviews with non-native english speakers!
Kinda disappointed that Anthony would platform Sky after all the horrible shit he's done
its so weird to think that lizzie has been around for so long, like ive watched her since the shadowcraft days and its just hard to believe because her videos are still pretty much the same as they used to be. like she was my childhood and now shes here talking about how its been over 10 years. Shadow Cadets for life
Adam's facade showed such a hilarious, entertaining man, but behind that mask was something unfortunate.
I need a separate video of lizzie. I really do. I want a run down on her whole youtube career because I've been watching her pretty much since the beginning :)
I find it weird not getting people that where making minecraft videos when it was in Alpha, like coestar (was in the 100k+ in the time that that was a ton of people), paulsaurjr, etc
Dude, I actually forgot Adam used to live with Posty
Could you do aphmau next that would be so cool😁
I was a huge PopularMMOs and Gaming with Jen fan back in 2015-2019. It was to the point where I laughed the same way as Jen and I literally wanted to be her. Young me was crazy.
Sky was my childhood away from sports, that and halo 3
Dan is literally my childhood thank you
Ldshadowladys videos practically raised me
I just wanted to say I wish popularmmos was in this
Skys and Popular MMOs were the 2 creators I watched ALL the time as a kid, I loved Skys cops and robbers videos so much, I miss his minecraft videos so much.
i totally forgot abt the things that sky did. i grew up with him, it’s so sad to see fame get to his head
man I wish he interviewed popularMMOs too
OKAY LISTEN ive watched Dan religiously and still do and skydoes too as OG's too so like yes og guys right here BUUUTTTTTT GUYS PLEASE WE NEED TO GET STAMPY AND SQUID ON HERE LIKE PLEASSEEEEE (STAMPYLONGNOSE AND IBALLISTICSQUID) ANTHONYY PLEEAAASSEEEEE
Lizzie posted one day after my one year bday 😂
lizzie is SO iconic she was my childhood
Love your videos, keep it up man!
it's weird to think that it's weird to see sky stable? idk all the things i've heard about him lately is that he went coocoo
I actually scared when I saw the thump nail
SkyDoesMinecraft's involvement in the interview has sadly aged like milk. If only he didn't do what those allegations claimed he did and if only he was able to get his mental health issues together... I also wondered if he did this interview for the sake of pinching as much money as he could before he evacuated from Youtube when things started to catch on fire for him...
Dantdm is our childhood and still is because  am 11 I have been watching for 6 years so keep going
I am so fucking happy thats skys sense of humor has not changed in the past few years
Where’s stampy
Could you spend a day with Aphmau?
Dang he interviewed Adam… well then
Ldshadowlady is one of my favorite YouTubers ever since I was a child
Arghh my heart....TDM & Sky both of my childhood minecraft youtubers...The OG....the one who introduced me loving mc
I feel so bad for Lizzie and Dan for now being associated with SkyDoesMinecarft :C
Vikkstar and smallish beans should've been here
Sky really is the peak example that success can and will break someone mentally. Not only actors and musicians do drugs and ruin their career. Everytime he came up on this interview I felt so awkward like I was dealing with some special ed kid.
I cried when you brought up Dan saving lives because he saved mine and he doesn’t even know it he’s my whole childhood and I’ve watched him for 7 years straight and I’ll never give up on him <3
wheres Stampy?
anyone else remember when Sky did the Maze Runner series with Aphmau and others? i do
POV: you're subscribed to lizzie, dan, and sky
I Love that everyone said like shout out to my team and my husband and then sky like dis my dog
I looove Lizzie’s channel I started in erm 2016?
I actually have my own channel it’s called %the cotton and candy%
Sees Dan and ldshadowlady 😊 Sees sky 👀😶
Adam (Sky) being Adam lolz
All of them giving shoutout to others was sooooo cute
Stampy :(
I have only my singular point of view, but if I was tasked with writing the history books, seananners would be one of the fundamental reasons that Minecraft became the cultural phenomenon it grew into.
No Captainsparklez :(
All of y'all are my favorite YouTubers and I still watch y'all's videos till this day.🙂🙂
Yay I love her
I was hoping for technoblade
Please do a day with Grain and MumboJumbo
disgusted with sky
"Shout out to my husband and friends" "This is Albert"
DanTDM was my childhood period.
Let us pray for Adam/Skydoes minecraft content for living a good life
should've had antivenom and captainsparkles on the show
WHAT ABOUT STAMPY CAT
12 billion vues
Dan ain't old 😤 old is 1,000 years old
DanTDM is my fav because I grew up with him
man, if only stamp was in this video this would be perfect
The Sky part didn’t age well 😬
8:09 vegetafruit 😱😱
I remember watching Sky in Elementary school! Omg memorys
I use to love sky buy now hes so anoying
Stampy tho :(
i grew up on dan and he was a huge inspiration to ke
Stampylongnose?
wheres stampy:(((
Tbh my childhood and English skills are mostly from Dantdm... From the old lab to fnaf damm that's nostalgic
Sky does everything is a prime example as to why you don't do drugs drink and party your ass off after you become rich and successful as shit will fall apart for you real fast
I painfully relate to Dan when he said he used minecraft characters as puppets because he didn't have anyone to play with God that reminds me of myself I'd watch his videos thinking he was so cool which he is then go play minecraft by myself all alone hell I'm still alone all these years later
Imagine if he did I spent a day with stampylonghead
Lizzie and Dan have not only survived over the years but they have also remained wholesome and uncontroversial, I still follow Lizzie and watch her videos, she met her own husband through Minecraft YouTube and she's still going strong, still has a solid following of loyal followers and still makes high quality content and keeps it fresh with each series she takes part in
"This is ALBERT"
Lizzie carried
Watching this gives me so much nostalgia, Dan was my ultimate favorite YouTuber back in the days. Kind of sad to think that I've outgrown my Minecraft phase and but I'm glad that they are still going on at it.  I was always so excited going home and watching their latest uploads.   Here are some of my favorite OG Minecrafters: DanTDM, Aphmau, Captainsparklez, PopularMMOs and Gaming with Jen, Stampylonghead, LDShadowLady, SkyDoesMinecraft, TheBajanCanadian, YourPalRoss, Mithzan, Slamacow, and TryHardNinja's minecraft songs.
Wish you couldve gotten popularmmos, ssundee and crainer  Those guys were my entire childhood
Lol skydoesminecraft hit the lowest
Anthony from Smosh
i wish i could go back to these times for just a day. how nostalgic haha
It's so awesome to see the people who literally built my childhood. I remeber running home from school watching these guys on the PC while playing on my Xbox lmao
Stampylonghead was also a good one you could've got
LDShadowLady's name is not lizzie it is Elizabeth Dwyer I don't know how to spell her last name lol
I HAVENT WATCHED YOU IN FOREVER LETS DO THIS
You couldn't get popularmmos 😨😭🤢🤮😭😷🤤😰😨😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☹️👆😩🍺🤢🤮🪥🍺🤢🤮
bruh, the lab was my childhood
when dan came to boise idaho he threw both his shoes into the crowd and my friends friend is now a proud owner of 1 of the 2 dantdm shoes
20:59 i love sky
I was happy seeing Sky as a legend Minecraft YouTuber.  But now.......  i wish he wasn’t.  And it sucks. He ruin many other Minecraft youtubers i love.  It sucks.  Idk if he is like this before YouTube or he became a monster once the fame comes.  It’s the reason why Stampy should replace Sky. Stampy always stick to Minecraft for so many years, he have his own home in a Minecraft tutorial World.    And Sky. He doesn’t understand why he really famous. Not because of himself but because of the other youtubers who were with him. Cops and robbers and epic jump maps. They were just normal people have a conversation and laughing while playing a sand box game.
Where’s stampy
Kinda wish stampy was in this lol
Me not knowing who skydoesmincraft is.
I love how Joel came before Lizzie but Lizzie is now the og legendary mincrafter lol
SKY TF!?!?! I THOUGHT YOU DIED
this didn't age well
Anthony is a fu***** Genius!
I would have loved to see Stampy. In my opinion he's such an iconic Minecraft youtuber and the first YouTuber I ever watched
Kind of disappointed without pat and or Jen
Omg i remember the medcon one
Stampylonghead was the og of the ogs
I’ve been subscribed and watching DanTDM since I found out what Minecraft and YouTube were. Been watching him since I was in middle school, so about 2011 😅 and his content is still so good I love his videos.
these three youtubers were definitely a huge part of my childhood.  i remember like back in 2014 when i discovered minecraft, i believe dan was the first minecraft youtuber that i watched and i really enjoyed his content and he got me hooked with the game. i then discovered lizzie and then adam thru lizzie.   they basically raised me at this point, specifically dan and lizzie (they're the two youtubers that i frequently would watch their contents back then until now) and they're one of the people who helped me find what my hobbies and interests were.  but lizzie will always have a special place in my life. it's been 7-8 years since i started watching her contents and i still watch her contents up to this day. she's my go to person. watching her videos really help lift up my mood whenever i'm feeling down and i dont ever plan to stop watching her contents.
oh wow i havent seen sky in a thumbnail in so long
Lizzie talking abt peaking makes me sad. I’ve been watching every week since 2013
Oh this aged well.
it's so funny, bc i'll forget abt these youtubers for a second, and I'll stumble across their channel and binge all of the videos I missed and it just makes me happy for some reason lol
I used to watch Dan as a littler kid (im 14 now) but I started watching lizzie on the Shadowcraft og days and i still watch her and always have.
the pioneers of subtitles and laughing and those kids of edits were Sky, Pewds, *lixian/markiplier,* and a few others
I am so happy seing LD here
Sad no one from the Pack was on this
Dan is the man
This didn't age well.
skys documentary jus ruins my imagine
Where popularMMOs and stamps?
1/3 of this video didnt age well
Damn this SkyDoesMinecraft dude seems so cool I hope he doesn't get cancelled for being a piece of shit wife abuser and manipulator!
Please don’t tell me u still support Sky after the evidence has come out against his terrifying allegations
Who the fuck is Skydoesminecraft? I'm so glad I didn't watch him.
I LOVE LDShadowlady ❤️ She’s my favourite YouTuber and will always be ❤️
You should interview PoppularMmos.
It’s crazy how time flies… I STILL watch LDShadowLady’s videos and been subbed since 2015😅
i remember when dan made 2 videos a day I was like 5 <3
Wish that Anthony could have done Popularmmos and also Jen
Tbh I’ve been a strong fan of ldshadowlady for awhile and I’m oh so glad she hasn’t felt compelled to change how she does things because the way she does videos will stay entertaining till the end of time.
i can't believe i watched skydoesminecraft as a kid when he was doing all his disgusting shit, abusing women, harassing friends and manipulating his wife.
I’m sorry but I can’t support the fact that Anthony would let an emotionally abusive person on his channel when making videos talking to abusive survivors and not 1 cut out all his parts or 2 reupload the without him 3 not include him in the video in the first place 4 edit him out before uploading you can he’s abusive and manic behaviour though out the whole video and this is harmful to people who’ve been thought abuse originally I didn’t say anything but this guy is a lot then I’ve could of imagined I’m not saying his name out of disgust from now on i will see Anthony in a different light after watching him do nothing about his behaviour
Wish he talked about popularMMOs
This is Albert * comedy
I thought technoblade would be in
even though i still watch lizzie, this still threw me very hard and violently into my childhood
why is this how i had to find out that sky sucks :(
Not this being youtube’s autoplay video after watching the j aubrey sky doc lol
Everyone shouts out people and whatnot Sky: This Albert
okay i feel old now. Im not even a real adult yeet
Man, this Sky guy looks like a wife beater, not sure why, just got that vibe.
Mhm wondering why popularMMOs and smallishbeans are not here there's a lot missing
You know shit was going down in a sky video when there's a portal made of melons
"...AND WELCOME BACK TO ANOTHER MINECRAFT MOD SHOWCASE, AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TODAY LOOKING AT THE MORE MOBS MOD" - skydoesminecraft
Skydoesminecraft was exposed for everything in the book idk if he should even be on the screen.
dan and lizzie: oh we make minecraft vids like usual    sky:haha i make music and abuse my wife manipulate people and im a really bad person! cool right? edit:just realized that he abused albert as well poor dog :(
Lizzie shouting Joel out at the end was so cute I love them so much
DanTDM is a legend.
16:00
i was really into atlantic craft when i was younger that’s what got me into mc but 9 years i truly depise the game
Low key dissapointed the yogs wernt a part of this
awee i miss Lizzie ;(
tbh it would be nice to see Dr. Trayuraus 1 last time
When I was younger, DanTDM was the first person I really ever watched, and he also was the first person to make me beg to my parents to get a game.
I will never move on from Lizzie! She's been my mother figure for what it feels like my whole life, I'm truly grateful. She's been there to comfort me at lonely times... honestly she is therapy lol. I'm so happy I grew up watching her and will still watch her until the end.
Where stamp
I kinda wished Iballisticsquid and stampycat was here and with popularmmos.  Building Time was the oG times when I was 5, now im 11 and about to turn 12.
Yooooooo where was stampy
WHERE’S STAMPY!!!!!!!!!??????
The twang in his voice when he says "My names Anthony Pedilla" gets me every time
What about stampylonghead
I was just annoyed on sky through out this cuz I know what he did----
i literally grew up with lizzie's videos and i still watch her to this day
omg i still remember dr trayorous i miss him WHY DID MOJANG KILL HIM AAAAAAAAA
Ok but, I’ve been watching all of these guys for my entire childhood, and I STILL watch them, and new people!
8:14 Your welcome.
You should interview stampy
I despise Adam for being able to make me like them for multiple years, and tricking me that they were the victim all along.   I believed Adam. Lots of people did. But they were just a manipulative monster.
Dan thinks he's feeling old at 29. Whereas me, at 21, after being today years old when I found out Dan was married and had a kid, I feel ancient in comparison!
the fact that i’ve been watching LDshadowlady for like over half of my whole life /srs
im suprised Stampy isnt in this video
'cause sometimes existing is exhausting' sometimes?
7:48 Courgette
Love the introse but cinda got im 14 and this is deep lol
Kill dream
Hello Anthony i really was interested in your DID vid keep it up
Poor sky this video didn’t age well
i love adam's personality, that was a huge part of me growing up and definitely influenced me up until this day haha
Im sure sky would never abuse his wife!
does anyone wonder where dr. treyaurus is now?...
o baby a triple ahhhhhhhh
WE NEED STAMPY!!!!
8:25 reminds me of Marvel’s Hawkeye, where Clint was taking a wizz and some guy wanted an autograph from him 😭
I grew up watching Dan. First video I watched was his minecraft surgeon simulator video. Around the time he broke his arm. Stopped watching him around late 2019. That’s around when he moved and dyed his hair back to brown. Watched him for like 8 or 9 years straight. He was someone I looked up to.
Sky is living the life man it's his world and we're just living in it
Where is popularmmos
Anthony The man That Can rob your house by going through your roof
me has an actual interest to watch the video  buffer:I am abt to end this man's whole career
I was hoping I would see Pat and Jen here. 😢 😭.  I miss them
my Only question why lizziy and not Ssundee he was the second biggest Mincrafter in team crafted which was a legendary group and he has more subs then her too so i would say he is a bigger youtuber
“Hey it’s me post Malone” -Post Malone
I used to watch them for HOURS. It's pretty sad that the newer kids today will probs not watch them, and instead watch Dream and stuff, no hate.
Yesss minecrafttt is the best
When I saw Lizzie I was like OMG i regularly watch her how did I manage to come past this video with my favorite youtuber?
❤I wish I could of watched these og  youtubers  when they first started but when they first started I was just born❤
Why does a pic of lizze pop in at the ned
DANTDM ME AND MY BROTHER USED TO WHATCH U
enybody remeber "new world" bye skydoesminecraft
Where is Stampy?   0/10 video wouldn't recommend to a friend
Aggghh fuck sky
Till this day Lizzie is still my fav youtuber
A YouTuber I watch who used to do Minecraft back in the day is Ihascupquake. I still remember her Oasis, Enchanted Oasis and Diversity series, and I know that she played a part in peoples childhood  Also another OG Minecraft YouTuber I used to watch is Aphmau, the Queen of Minecraft roleplay. She used to do so many Minecraft roleplay series that lots of people watched. The characters in her stories are loved by so many people
I’m just saying stampys Minecraft let’s plays  was a big part of peoples childhoods
Dude, Sky is definitely on A LOT of drugs, i love it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s funny cuz of all the shit that’s happend with sky now
Well, I guess I have to subscribe
I have danTDM books
BUhDTER'!!
DanTDM made all our Goof old days
I love this so much ❤️ I do wish that popularmmos was in this. Idk if u asked and he said no but if you ever do another vid can u do stampylongnose, popularmmos, and captain sparkles?! They were and are my childhood
it’s so funny because the conventions were WILD AS FUCK when they first started happening. now they got security at every stop hahah
21:04 how DARE you spell Trayaurus wrong
HE WAS LIVING WITH POST MALONE CASUALLY WTF
We need a part 2. Maybe with Stampy too.
Ahhh damn dude, this came up in my recommended and I decided to check the comments, I cannot describe the amount of pain I have reading all the happy comments about Sky, and knowing that all of those peoples' childhood hero turned out to be a bad person. Sometimes I fool myself, trick myself into thinking it's not real and that my first and all-time favorite YouTuber is exactly who I always believed him to be, a wonderful person who does his best to be kind towards others. It's so hard to see and read everyone being obliviously joyful when I now know it's just a facade.
DanTDM, Stampy, iBallisticsquid, and Squaishy practically raised me. I love them so much and they will always have a special place in my heart.
fun fact: Adam goes by They/Them now
Anybody else remember pink haired Dan?
I always wanted to go to that tour and see Dan and same with everyone else 🥲
CAN YOU PLEASEEEEEEE DO AN INTERVIEW WITH SMALLISHBEANS/JOEL? I LOVE HIMMM
Every shouting out normal stuff Sky: ✨A L B E R T ✨
Oh god a zucchini….
Lizzie was my childhood YouTuber and I still watch her- but now I watch Technoblade,Tommyinnit etc
Their shout outs are so wholesome
Really sad what Skydoesminecraft has turned into. I hope his ex-gf is doing better
Can confirm. Courgettes are fruits
April 21 thats my birthday
why isn't CaptainSparklez in this??
I feel each one of these content creators should and are deserving of their own interview
please do one with mumbo jumbo
Dan is amazing
Im gonna cry dor days if people stopped playing Minecraft. It Will end one time… And im not ready
I remember playing Minecraft story mode and seeing all the YouTubers in so 6 and not knowing who they were and then started to watch them
I think I will probably watch Lizzie forever I have watched her since crazycraft
i have no idea who the sky guy is?
Bruh no popular MMOs?
lizzie and dan is my childhood i will always love them lol
NI HA CHU xDDDDDD 15:36
DanTDM was such an inspiration for me my YT channels name is even a reference to him and other og minecrafters
I have not seen anybody mentioning Bashurverse in the comments.
huh sky seems cool, i wonder if he has enough time away from youtube to love and support his wife.
wheres popularmmos :(
Having Adam here didn’t age well
I only watched this for Lizzie😅
I was an OG for dantdm, a new fan for ldshadowlady (my fav yt), and never heard of sky
WE NEED STAMPY, CAPTAINSPARKELZ, SQUID, AND POPULARMMOs like cmon man, how could you forget them!?
Biggest flex im an og shadowcaddet idk if thats how you spell im bad at it
the first you tube videos I watched were Dan's mod videos it was amazing
Bro where's stampy I watch him for 8 years and he's a og
Lizzie is one of my favourite YouTubers she was kinda young when she started and I was like omg I will watch her she looks so cool and that was like 4 yrs ago
MY CHILDHOOD YOUTUBERS ;(
Treyaurus was a real one <//3
Why is pat from popularmmos not here
Another original minecrafter was PopularMMOs, but he pretty much died off YouTube at this point
Kinda disappointed that Captain Sparklez isn't in these videos and no one has mentioned him in the comments.
13:21 “wait your ALIVE?!?!”
I still watch Lizzie, it still feels like shadowcraft wasn't published so long ago
If for some reason came out a part two, the hispanic community would love to see ElRichMC in this series
I wish stampy was here, he's still uploading lovely world videos
oi dan uhhh my favorite old vid was when you guys opened a coffee shop
Ooooohhhhh nooooooo skydoesminecraft
I still like Lizzie
If you can do a interview with popular minecraft players like Stampy IballisticSquid and another
back when i was 5 - 8 Dan was the only youtuber that i watched and i still do
It was nice to see Adam again. It was also nice to see his humor again too. I do hope his life turns for the better
It broke my heart when Dan admitted that...       Dr. Trayaurus and Grim were never real...
Me who haven’t left LDshadowlady’s channel*
God.... I miss sky he was my childhood... but it's sad to say he will never be the same
Sky does Minecraft is a nonce
*cough cough* stampy
here is pancake recipe:   Ingredients • 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour  • 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder  • ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste  • 1 tablespoon white sugar  • 1 ¼ cups milk1 egg  • 3 tablespoons butter, melted    Process    Step 1    In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.     Step 2    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.    Enjoy!
My first youtube video I watched was dantdms first video in the world with the lab with grim and Dr Trayaurus. But I watched all three of these people when I was a kid oml the memories flooded back when I read those names.
"and knee-ha-chu"
tbh i only know DanTDM in this vid
are you an actor?
THE BACON MAN PART BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES
CHILDHOOD
do popluarmmos
BUDDER!!!!!
DanTDM is 29! I remember when he was like 20. I'm now 19 years old. That's nuts.
I really appreciate and remember these channels even if I kind of outgrew Minecraft videos. It was never personal, I just shifted away from these videos as I got older and busier and went through some tough times. It also didn't help that I didn't realize that I stopped getting notifications from these channels as YouTube changed and updated. It's kind of sad but I appreciated my time with these videos and creators and still appreciate them even if I don't watch so much anymore.
ni ha chu LOL it's pronounced niachu lol. (no hate, srry if it came of as passive agressive)
Bruh one time I had I dream that it was Halloween and Dantdm was outside and he had like a house and he was handing out candy. And like I stole something so I hide.
Bruh where’s stampy
I appreciate every but sky
<3
Dan was the first minecraft YouTuber I watched. I remember in 2013 stealing my brother’s iPad just to watch him. I had random bursts throughout my lifetime of watching him. I’m glad he always stood the same and never from what I know of did anything problematic. I’m just glad he was apart of my childhood
SkyDoesMinecraft, more like sky does time in jail
God I remember sky’s try not to laugh videos. All of these were most likely part of everyone’s childhood
I rally want to see Anthony do a vid with the OG's Poppulormmo's, and GamingWithJen.
i miss adam so much theyre such a genuine dude but they just disappeared and now im sad
Man. Knowing what Adam did now just makes this video hard to watch.
I am very happy about this video is so much fun
ahhh yes dan tdm my favorite og minecraft player
Crazy thing is that the audience who used to watch these people have moved on and watch more mature content like this and they come to a deep understanding of the people that they used to admire and used to think as gods and realize that they are just humans like them and feel tired and burnt out and stuff.
Too bad that Adam is a horrible person and I never new that, because I was a literal child. Now, almost 21 and have a little boy of my own. I learned he’s an abuser to his ex girlfriend who was pregnant. Not okay. He didn’t deserve to be interviewed now knowing how shitty of a person he is.
shouldve gotten PopularMMOs on there
Seeing this video after hearing the allegations against Adam, it just breaks my heart and it makes me angry that this was all just a mask.
Can you please do SSUNDEE🔥
20:27
As an OG person who has watched Adam Dahlberg, he is not what his ex girlfriend said about him. The ex girlfriend has abused him physically and mentally. He is so tough and amazing for surviving that. He is an absolute angel and such an incredible person. Pretty sure we all know that he would never do such a thing.
This sky guy is so cool. I hope he's not a drug addict and a wife abuser, hope his living peacefully
Sky was the absolute highlight of my childhood and it crushed me when he quit and all that drama and stuff happened I was just... cried a lot tbh
Spelt Trayaurus wrong...
10:33 POV: germany in 1936
I remember the good old days of minecraft thise were the days
this is weird watching know. i never really watched sky so was watching because of Lizzy so its weird seeing him after all the allegations and knowing has a pretty big piece of shit.
When talking about their highlights be like: Dan: "i got to go on tour meeting a bunch of fans and seeing their smiling faces"  Lizzie: "i got to be in minecraft story mode and it was a surreal and validating experience"   Adam: "i got rich."  I love that🤣
God I wish Stampy was in this video
We need a part 2 with some more og YouTubers such as popularmmos and stampy
“A decade ago” oh please don’t say that
I will never forget
when i was a kid i get up real close to the screen and try to talk to the villagers
Where stampy
My teens years meet my children
This aged.
I heard this after the whole skydoesminecraft stuff, makes me sad.
"Used to watch" i still watch all the ogs
watching sky's interview after him being exposed just feels....  off....
I miss the old times now we have this dream sexsual bullsh*t
Someone better start making a Sky Reupload channel cuz y'all clownin them in the comments- Keep up the good work!
coming back to this video after the sky drama is heartbreaking
Dan is the reason I played Minecraft
LDShadowLady and DanTDM are still amazing youtubers. I’d say Sky was good if it wasn’t for uh… things he did…
a third of this video aged like already aged milk, which part?
i have been watching sky since i was little… im 17 now
Welp, this didnt age well
Woah i didnt know that lizzie was an og mincrafter
Zack Scott games 🥺omg
"Wake up make videos go sleep" best quote ever
My man spelt Trayauras wrong and so did I
Lmaoooooo! Throwback to Link not knowing what a fruit is..and that seeds were able to differentiate the two! Aaaaahhhhaaaaaa
I never really watched Sky or Dan, but Lizzie.. she was my childhood and is to this day, I sh!t you not, my favorite YouTuber. Honestly, a bunch of my sense of humor, which is the biggest part of my personality was inspired by Lizzie, which is understandable, having watched her since I was 6.   I truly hope to be like her. She has touched thousands and millions of people and has the power to put a smile on millions of people's faces, just hearing her voice or seeing a picture of her.
Dan literally raised me .. Bc id ride the bus home and watch his content until I slept. He taught me a lot actually and I'm so thankful
Man this sky guy seems like cool guy hope he doesn’t end up being a terrible person
7 months late but, I will really miss the old youtubers and now with how the youtube world works, I feel bad for the older youtubers having to adapt and switch just to stay active
Dude Dantdm is big know he had kid omg I miss when I was super you g watching his pokemon minecraft videos and the his other vids
WHERES PHIL
The entirety of sky's perspective has not aged well, I hope Elizabeth (sky's ex-fiance) is doing okay with their new child
These were some of the people who made my childhood
OGs interviewing OGs
I Grew up watching Dantdm  I will still watch because he is always funny
If only he knew about the skydoesminecraft drama…
i just remember watching DanTDM with my brother in the summer vacation :)
Where is stampy tho?
LDshadowlady has and will always be one of my favs!
one of the people I need to see on your channel is the story of 8 bit ryan and maybe his friends as for 5 years strait he uploaded a video every single day even on holidays and only recently he a took a  4 day break and now uploads twice a week still bad but yeah it may not be minecraft in fact until 2019 he'd never played it in his life but his story is very interesting even how he met his friends is neat.
Gizzy? Ssundee?
Dantdm had such an impact on my childhood. Things like the color blue, short hair, and even minecraft all became things I love because I started loving it through his channel. I still will watch his videos, even going back to the old Modded Minecraft server of Diamond Dimensions and he is just such an integral part of my childhood that I can't imagine it without him. Thank you so much Dan for everything <3
Damn, just give me a bowl of alphabet soup, a nice cup of milk in my snoopy cup, and my old white tablet so I can watch smosh, stampy, DanTDM, etc. I miss those days so bad. Glad to see them all happy now though.❤️
But no stampy? Yea ur done.
Pov you guys are watching to see the comments talk about him:
Skydoesfuckup*
ALBERT
I think Daniel said it best , "Let's not stay young but grow up together"                       -daniel
I WISH LITTLE CLUB ADVENTURE IS HERE I MISS THEM
I still watch ldshadowlady to this day!
you should get popularmmos
I like how they didnt shoutout anything for them, because at this point they dont need it
note to editor: YOU SPELLED TRAYAURUS WRONG DURING THE SHOUTOUT SESSION!!!!
Can I have a picture "Man who says this while watching Dan Pee" WTF 😂
i watched lizzie so much bro especially her room makeover where she made those totoro stencils i thought her room was so cool
Stampy cat😭
Ayo next you need stampy to come on
The idea that a Minecraft YouTuber was living with post Malone is hilarious
I love danTDM,LDShadowlady and Anthony!Perfect video!
Dan literally raised a generation and now he's raising his son. 😭
Can you do a video with my childhood youtuber, Stampylonghead?
sky nooooooooooooooo
Who else remembers stampylonghead
……………… sky……….. you disappointed us
Lets be honest, all of the comments that said good things about skydoesminecraft did not age well at all
ldshadowlady is my favorite content creator and always will 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
i just want him to interview philza
Sky by far was most of my child hood
8:18 It’s like that one scene from Hawkeye!
Which minecon was it?  I was at 2016 in Anaheim
oh, what a day to get this as a recomendation
AHHH
Honestly, there was some past allegations with abuse from Sky’s ex-wife, thus he couldn’t get custody of Mason but now I feel so blind.
well uh, skydoesminecraft didn't really end well. 🤪
You should do a part 2 but you do it with some other OG YouTubers for example Stampylongnose
i wish Stampy was here, he was the first minecraftcontent creator i watched! also oof this didnt age well..
This video aged like milk. Sky can go rot in hell
Bruh you forgot stamps cat
21:04 6 Months later I only now realized anthony’s editors spelt trayaurus wrong
This aged like fine whine  *video also features skydoesminecraft*
Did anyone else watch the Little Club growing up? I feel like it's just me ;-; But I also watched Lizzie a lot and I'm so happy that she's still making content! <3
I don’t see stampy:(
Jeez Antonys intros are so good he can sit there talking about random shit and I will still watch the whole thing
I would have loved to see the even more OG minecrafters like Guude
ANTHONY WHAT SIZE SHOE YOU WEAR
I think what also content creator need to notice is that the people that use to watch them are now grown up and don’t necessarily watch them anymore it’s like them as the people who raised us are now sending us off to collage ya know we’ve grown up and it’s sad yeah but we’ve gotta at some point
Lol I got recommended this video right after I watched a video about sky’s cancellation on Twitter
ily dan
I grew up watching Lizzie when I didn’t know any English, now I am fluent and having more fun watching her than before lol
sure hope sky dosent end up being a horrible person that would be crazy
oh gosh. adams here
dude it’s insane to think that dan still posts.. and HE HAS A SON with jenna. like that’s crazy. he saved me so fucking much 8 years ago and still does when i need him. he basically raised me because my parents never did and i could never be more thankful. fuck bro i cant
as Im rewatching your video I noiticed that you say nihAchu instead of nIhachu lmao
this didn't age well didn't it
they were my childhood
Please make a video with stampy pls
adam talking about his demons.. was that a cry for help? ):
Poor puppy
I love when they talk about smosh 😃😃
When it showed the pic of dan at the beginig it should of should the meme face
Such a lovely dog! I hope nothing horrible is done to him c:
I used to admire sky so much... But I'll never side by him again
It should have Popularmmos ssundee and dantdm
whos here after sky became a child predator
21:00 *A L B E R T*
10:36 what the boy DOIN bit sus
Stampy
You should do poketubers
I often say I was raised by the internet, and realizing that I watched these folks when I was 11 years old makes me think they probably should have been able to claim me on their taxes XD
Umm.. sky.. uhh-- man how this aged kind of bad
it was just like yesterday when I watched DanTDM <3
It sucks that SDM is now a really bad person, I looked up to him so much.
(i will be using they/them pronouns for sky/adam)  i know they were a big part of my childhood but with all the information that has come to light recently it makes me sick to my stomach that i used to watch them.  ANYWAY DanTDM and LDshadowlady i still watch them cause they are both amazing and i watched a lot of other OG minecraft youtubers and i still watch them
This is so random but can you do a I spent a day with Ian hecox I just want to see a video of you to henging out together please 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Hm sky
If been watching Lizzie since ShadowCraft and she has been a huge part of my life <3 She’s definitely changed it for the better. I still watch her today and she is my favorite YouTuber. Ily so much Lizzie <3333
when this video aged horrible for sky
Well Adam’s section didn’t age well
stampy should’ve been in this
Anthony, Take the parts of the video down with Adam. Look at the allegations against him. And please, PLEASE, respond to my messages.  I ask this all because I feel like there is little care in what you do. You only talk to those on the same scale as you. Followers have to be high. I signed a contract, albeit, I did not read it, but because I trusted you.  Please, I hope you see this.
skydoesminecraft did something horrible
Aged like fruit
I stopped watching all of them except Lizzie I still watch her after about 8+ years 😭😭 im 16 this year 😟
this video didn't age well with sky in it
i check on Dan's channel occationally now, but i used to watch hes Lab videos ALL the time he'll always have a place in my heart          weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Daaaan!!
I think lizzie enjoys it cause she doesn't view it as a job/burden? She takes her breaks and does her "recipe" but yet she still keeps people on edge waiting for her to post, whether it be over a month or just a few days. And I will always love and respect her so so so much.
Skydoescrimes
This one aged like milk
LDShadowlady never really came out of relevance she still has an average 1.4 million views per video, even in the Minecraft dark ages before pewdiepie revived it her views are still consistent lol.
Uh ohhhh
ok can we talk about how amazing lizzies hair looks?
I found Lizzie’s channel during COVID. She made me enjoy quarantine, she might be the reason I’m still here.
Might want to edit out sky does mincraft
this didn't age well...
so uh anyone here after the skydoesminecraft situation?
i love lizzie and dan <33
Who else is here after the allegations of Adam/Sky has came out
this needs to be reuploaded lol
Where was Stampy
The Skydoesminecraft segment didn’t age well
(:
I feel old because I used to watch them back when I was younger I’ve been playing Minecraft since I was four feels weird to make a YouTube channel now
whos here after the allegations and had their childhood ruined?
This makes me sad. Grew up watching sky. Now everything about him gives me bad vibes.
The parts with sky are very cringey now
This didn’t age well
whos here after sky getting exposed?
Sky Made this video a bit sour
uhmm anthony? yeah can u pls reupload it cus the recent things abt skydoesminecraft are disgusting , the man tortured his family
adam is still so funny man i miss him
Sky is an abuser.
This isn't sitting well now
To bad you'll never know what I commented 😈
This video didn't age well
This did not age well " legendary". Oh he was until boom.
watch sky doesminecraft exposed its shocking actually
Poor dog. Barely anybody knows what this skytard did to his wife, his dog. He is a horrible person. Im glad he stopped posting he deserves all the hate he got.
turns out sky is a horrible horrible person
after learning about sky, this video makes me feel sick :(
.... I dont know what to say at this point really.... Im disappointed yet not surprised with how every other youtubers been called out recently
Genuinely so disappointed in sky. It makes me sick how he treated people who only tried to help him
I'm gonna be sick
It is unlikely you’d even read my comment but can somehow someway this video be edited and reuploaded I personally don’t like seeing Adam/netnobody based off the things that he has done to his partners and the things that have come out about him on Twitter I don’t think he should continue to get recognition for what he has done to the people around him
Who’s here after the allegations towards Sky? 😬
This didn’t age well…
Reading comments on here about how Sky made their childhood. I'm sorry
Adam is chaotic as ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣
bruh this video is great hopefully it doesn’t get taken down
:(
so.
This didn’t age well.
sad to watch after what happened with sky
am i the only person who noticed that there's a skylanders poster in the back at 27 secs
Was surprised the yogscast wasn't in this. Lewis and Simon you know shadow of israphel , yoglabs , the adventure maps.
"Hey it's me Post Malone" and "Oh, hey shit, it's post Malone" Were strangely hilarious to me
5:26 it’s insane how popular he got looking back
I remember seeing old ass minecraft videos with sky and ssundee and all these other old minecraft youtubers. I wonder if those are still up, good times
I loved this video. Sky was my entire childhood he made me not feel alone and he was basically my friend I never met in real life. Even today I listen to his music and watch his old videos. Even today his videos can get me out a depressed funk. -Love you Sky!
*Rise of fame* Lizzie: A video from Zack Scott Games Dan: A comment from SkyDoesMinecraft Adam: *Squid.*
just finding this series and I’m so glad!! Love Lizzie so much!!
spend a day with popularmmos
.          _.
Yo where is Ethoslab? That man is still going strong on his let’s play
Dantdm literally introduced to minecraft and man...its been 7 years since i started
Imagine if stampy was here!
2:44 is superior
Can you please have laurenZSide plz♣️♥️
He should do one with Aphmau she is such an amazing minecraft player who makes amazing rp skits
Only knew about dantdm before watching this. Never watched any of them either. 🤷‍♀️
these ppl raised me lmao
I love these OG’s and others like stampy bruh these guys raised us
sky was living with pre malone, and he didn't even know what was gonna go on with him!
i still cant believed that ive known dan and lizzie 2015 time really flies huh
You have a hole in your jeans
ADAM I NEED THE MUSIC. Im dying
I’m sorry but Nih CHUU?
i Lowkey use to be such a fanboy of LDshadowLady
What about Stampylonghead ? My childhood.
DO STAMPY!!!
There's not a single Gen Z person out there who hasn't watched at least one of these 3. They are some of the people who raised our generation
The interview we all needed
Now, I’m not sure if he’d want to do this, but if Anthony makes another video like this, he needs to have Stampy.
I love sky
It’s funny how I’ve been watching Lizzie for 6 years and I still watch her a lot :)
Wish stampy was in this but still a great group of minecraft YouTubers
LDSHADOWLADYYYYYYY WOOOOOHOOOO
I grew up with ldshadowlady and dantdm, as well as popularmmos and little Kelly and little Carly. When I say I “grew up” with them I mean when I had no friends they were my friends, when I felt alone they were the people who were there for me
I grew up on Lizzie and then eventually I shifted to Dan's content  I'm sad to say I've never watched Sky and he is not a part of my childhood memories
Lizzie has to be my favorite youtuber, I often go through phases where I'm in love with a certain youtuber but them in a few weeks or days I'll move onto a new one. But I stick with Lizzie and she helped me a lot during the panini
I wish we could see sky play mincraft with the modern youtubers
You should do 'I spend a day with Anthony Padilla'.
I watched Dantdm, LDSHADOWLADY, Little Kelly and Carly, That turtle Tim guy, Captain Sparkles, Iballistic and Stampy
WHERE IS CAPTAINSPARKLEZ
Sky was the cc that introduced me Minecraft centric content when i was like 7 or something and, here i am, 8 years later still mainly watching Minecraft videos/ccs
..who the hell is LDShadowLady?   I use to watch DanTdm and SkyDoesMinecraft ..man the nostalgia of just coming home from school and seeing a newly released video from both of them.  These people carried a whole generation.
I miss sky so much and all the og minecraft friends 😔
Where’s stampy
This was the crossover that seven year old me wanted
Aww man theres no dream i wish dream was there
lizzie and dan were my childhood oh my god. stampy too 💔
FINALY ( ldshadow is very underrated so yea)
Anthony when are you getting pewdiepie on here?!?
Ok Lizzie was my childhood
A day with hermits from hermitcraft?
OMG YOU SHOULD DO GRIAN
Should definitely interview Aphmau
Wish I could go back to 2015 when I first started watching Minecraft youtubers on my mom's account!
kinda wish stampy was in this
Lizzie is still one of my favourite youtubers, for basically all my life and she was the reason I started to play Minecraft and still do <3 I basically owe it all to her
Jerome
Can you pls teach me how to jump off a ceilling?
do stampy pls
Loved this video, just wish stampy could be in it 😟
Weird idk how I never heard of Lizzie
Honestly I remember hating dan mostly just because I felt like he thought he was everything. But now listening to him. He’s honestly a really nice guy. And I’m glad to be proved wrong
I love how mature Dan is
U NEED TO DO SSUNDE
Anthony not only were these guys our childhoods dan and sky practically raised me.
Hello AnthonyPadilla can you spend a day with Philza from Minecraft pls thanks. :)
WAIT I HAD NO IDEA WHO SKYDOESMINECRAFT WAS AND ONE TIME ON A MC SERVER SOMEONE SAID "ITS SKYDOESMINECRAFT!!" Im serious
Holy shiittttt
It’s so crazy to think that it’s been over a decade since all those videos because I remember watching ldshadowlady when she first got big

Bro this is nostalgic I used to watch sky and Dan all the time as a kid
"AND POST MALONE" BAHIHAJVSGUH
Omg skydoseminecraft and dantdm are literally my childhood bro
3:47 my 8 year old selfs mind would be blown by this revelation
Everyone has just deep stories like wow -😀
ALBERT
i remember making a youtube account when i was 12 to watch sky. such nostalgia. also just massive respect for the dude now  also remember watch dan all the time too after seeing my brother watch him (also in like middle school). this is such a nostalgia trip
I remember coming home from school in the 1st grade. I got on my lil tablet and watched Sky does Minecraft. He was playing cops and robbers with people, that was in I want to say 2013-2014. Im now in the 9th grade. I miss old youtube :)
sky is just a mood in this vid
anthony part 2 add technoblade and philza
PLZ DO AN INTERVIEW W STAMMPYYTYGYFGSJHDGFHJ
Dang Adam helped me through a hard time then Dan as well as others but Skys was always had me wondering what I was doing with life lol not in a bad way but him dan and that fnaf one was my go to when trouble was going on lol I still rewatch Adams vids as well as dans! Definitely going to look into Lizzies now to!
I love how sky just started off by saying Yooo big fan
Someone always says sub to anthony
Ok let's be honest.who remembers popularMMOs .
21:07 Did- did they just spell Trayaurus’s name wrong?
I feel like stampy is just watching this crying that he’s not in it while laughing a lot...
Anthony in 2021: I spent a day with legendary OG Minecrafters! Anthony in 2080: I spent a lifetime being an OG youtuber!
3:35 DanTDM: I didn’t collab with people Stampy: am I a joke to you now? Hah hahhh!
"I was living with team crafted and post malone" hmm yes the most nonchalant sentence ever mentioning a celebrity
DanTDM is the 1st Youtuber I've ever watched.
I'm a low gaming youtuber, uhm... I just gave up on roblox, and uh I remeberd in 2015 I downloaded minecraft, so I just popped up like, "Oh! I haven't played minecraft why don't I do that?!"  I made my first minecraft video on August 2nd 2019 And I told my viewers I downloaded minecraft in 2015.
I love Lizzie so much, I have been watching her since the first episode of Shadowcraft.. I still enjoy watching her.
i <3 being gen z
Æ
stampy?
Seeing Sky really brought back memories and made me cry. Sky was a very big player in me wanting to be a content creator  Screw you for doing that shit to Elizabeth. I hate you. 🥳🥳🥳
lizzie did swear at a crafting table back in shadowcraft lmaojssjhsis
im happy to have grown up watching ldshadowlady <3 i still watch her all the time she is most likely my favourite youtuber ily lizzie
Why no ssundee :(
Correct me if im wrong sky’s voice sounds like dream
Lulz     Thank me later Anthony
stampy
I loved sky's videos so much, especially prison break, I loved coming home and binging those videos
Hearing their voices after such a long time was such a slap in the face like, "surprise bitch you're in college now how do you feel knowing you were a fifth grader watching these guys."
sky's energy has always been and is contagious
Bring stampy and pat OGS FOR LOFE
Why dont captainsparkles get drip bru
"And now, you can go make me a sandwich" *intro start's playing*
These people created my childhood watching this video literally left me in tears cause I still watch them every now and then and I always will even if/when they stop making videos i love them all so much all the og minecrafters are so important to me
we need tom syndicate on this
Wtf you make videos i don't your on youtube
This video feels kinda funny for me because I learned of these creators years after I started playing minecraft and they never been OGs for me. Buy I know that's just because I was raised in a non English-speaking country and therefore my friends at the time didn't know about them. I'm just wondering how many OG minecraft Youtubers that speaks other languages I don't know about.
Where is smallish beans
Lizzie: I expect people to move on from my content Me: *nervous sweats in watching for 7 years*👀
I fucking love Sky🥺
its sad to see where sky was and where he is now. broken friendships, loss of career, downwar spiral,etc
DanTDM and Lizzie were a huge part of my childhood <3
Where is Stampy
where is stampylongnose???
Where’s ssundee
sky literally made me...
Og viewers would watch dan, sky and lizzie somewhere around 2010
Should have got stampy on
you should do a part 2 with ihascupqake, paulsoaresjr (he made the minecraft tutorial video that used to be on minecraft official site) and captainsparklz
Man... I loved sky so much! Bacon man, squid and budder!  Love to see he is still the same too. Yeah music!
Damn just heading the words "Team Crafted" sent me back. I only watched a few of the members (SSundee being the most frequent) and I remember there being some controversy and falling out, but I didn't follow that.
childhood
Glad to know skys personality is still somewhat the same lol
I'm suprised he didn't try to get stampy for this video
This my opinion that no one will care about but I like the old youtubers more, probably because they are more nostalgic and I grew up with them, when I was younger they were towards kids but when their fans grew up they made more mature content but still appropriate for kids.
I have watched lizzie Semper 2014, not gonna stop
It’s was crazy to see Dan on here. I luv these vids, and to see Dan with Anthony was amazing
Spend a day with hermitcraft members, aka Grian, Mumbo, and possibly scott or scar
i love the chelsea smile bmth reference😭
Are Sky and Post Malone still friends?
*v*
im glad to see adam doing better with his mental health. i still remeber that i stopped watching him because i saw how much he didint like making videos any more cant wait to hear his music hope he does really well and gets the goal he wants
Basically the intro :   *Anthony falls from the sky*  “Hello, and I’m interviewing __ :)”  “Are they still doing great, OR SUPER HORRIBLE THING?”
God I used to watch these people before I even saw a world map
Yes
Sky is OG because he lived with PreMalone
Ive missed Sky/Adam so much, his videos used to be what i would go to when life was hard! and then i remembered him one day and went back and say that he didnt do the minecraft vids anymore T-T
DanTDM and Sky were my childhood, they helped me through my ossues with my family and i miss when sky made minecraft videos. The do not laughs, hide and seeks, introducing us to Max, Barney, Ross and so many more. There shenanigans were soooo much fun. Dan's series with dr tryaurous and testing all types of mods. Im still easing into watching Lizzy but i am happy that at least some of the new mcytz have met, the old mcyts still make videos, even if its not the same content.
I feel like there is a lack of stampy.
Skydoesminecraft was one of the main reasons I got into Minecraft mods. Truly a cool dude.
the only mcyt I could ever really love. i don’t think I’d be who I was without these people. literally hand crafted my childhood ( was more a popular mmo’s fan but yknow). So so so much respect for them all.
lizzie is so funny i miss watching her tbh i rlly think it’s crazy how i went from watching her to watching tommyinnit, quackity; wilbur soot, karl and just like other people on the dsmp
Who's SkyDoesMinecraft?
I'm so thankful for this interview, but I can't help but wish other mcyt's were interviewed as well. Not only did these 3 make my childhood, especially Dan. I also want to include other YouTubers that did the same. Aphmau, SamGladiator and Stampy :')
I love this video and all these creators but *WHY THE HELL IS SKY HOLDING THE MIC IN THE COMPLETE WRONG DIRECTION!?!?*
Sky made my childhood
If he did another one of these I would want to see stamps and sundee to they are also legendary OG Minecraft YouTubers
DAN AND LIZZIE
Let me tell you I clicked on this for skydoesmincraft tea😂
Uh I know a youtuber that uploads 5 videos day
damn i miss sky wonder what he's doing right now
Its a shame stampy wasnt there.... but anyways  GREAT VID <3
I would love to see u interview ssundee, I feel like ssundee was one of the MCYT's, that gained more popularity, despite the fact that the game itself was destroying itself, at the time.
Sky will always be remembered (by me) as the person who made me love Minecraft so much and his "Do Not Laugh," "Cops and Robbers," "Hide and Seek," and his animations were something I looked forward to all the time.
Lizzie was & is my favorite mc youtuber of all time ♡ I go back and rewatch series from my childhood, and even check in on her new stuff. Ty for the great memories and new ones!
FROM SWEDEN
I remember watching them when I was a little kid time really flies by
hmmm this hits me with so much nostalgia!!
I remember watching skydoesminecraft's  minecraft roomates and minecraft do not laugh as well as DantheDiamondMinecart with Dr.Treyaurus series everyday after middle school/ high school. Even as a 21 yr old i love rewatching them from time to time
i saw the thumbnail and i literally shouted “LIZZIEEEEE”
15:36 Nihachu nice
In cooking a Zucchini is a vegetable, but in botany it is a fruit, more specifically, a pepo, or berry.
dantdm was my childhood
“I’m very confident that my recipe for Minecraft videos is working and I’ll keep using it” puuuuuurrr ocean queen puuuurrrrrr
I grew up watching ShadowLady. I remember her post of playing zombies
Wait. So when Dan's son is about 13 he's 40+???
i really want a part two to this with other people like stampy, bajancanadian, captainsparklez, popularmmos
You gotta make a part two with Stampy, PopularMMOS, and SSundee
Ive been watching lizzie since the very beginning. Shes so comforting man. I hope she keeps growing and new people find out about her!
dantdm was my childhood sooo
Does anyone remember stampy long noes  he was my childhood
Whenever i feel nostalgic, i just watch a few of Dan and Sky videos tbh. Anyone else feel old watching them again?
adam has not changed much and it's so nostalgic to see him still being the bubbly guy i used to watch.
I feel like my childhood was awoken
Every time I think of danTDM all I can think of is the diamonds in the rough  meme
Lizzie by far had an impact on how I thought about Minecraft and gaming in general
YES LIZZIE! I’ve been watching her for years!
Sky is extremely chaotic still. I’m glad
My childhood. These people shaped who I am today
Lizzie specifically had a huge impact on my life. The first time I watched her was in 2017 (yeah, I was kind of late to the bandwagon). I think I've watched almost every video since then, and the majority of the ones prior. The idea that people like her, as well as Dan, have changed as their audience has gotten older just makes me look forward to what happens next, Yet miss what was at the exact same time.
Imagine how an interview with SSundee would be... it would be so depressing. :(
I would love to see Adam play doom
i specifically remember watching that candy episode of dans
Where's pat and jen
22:10 Pewdiepie is a quantum super demon confirmed
LEGENDS's meeting that i never knew i needed
8:46 ignore this I just need to remember where I got up to so I can come back to it lol
Adam mentioning using they/them pronouns on twitter a month after this video released and the video after this being about non binary people is kinda funny
Dream Stans be like WHERE'S DREAM!?
sky was my whole childhood.
i love dan so much
we r now 4 months later and still no netnobody music
Ssundee plz
Sky is hands down the greatest Minecraft youtuber of all time to me. Other than Dan. Mans had the hugest impact on my life too and couldn’t live without his vids at the time. Hope the man comes back soon
I wish Bajancanadian was in this
There is pat too
Skydoesminecraft and ldshadowlady are my childhood, I've been watching ldshadow lady since like 2014 and still watching. See this video makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
Dantdm and aphmau were better then any other entertainment when I was like 12
I'm sorry but you called nihachu knee-ha-chu is more like nia-chu
seeing sky on here brings me back to when i was 12. definitely better times
My friends say i had ko childhood because i know no one here except for DanTDM which i watched
20:26 Dan and Lizzie swear :0
I will always cherish skys existence, that man was the highlight of my childhood
adam reminds me so much of post malone so i wasn’t surprise when he said he’s friends and lived with him lmao
adams humor is unmatched lmao
Where is stampy
DANTDM IS ONLY 29 ?!?!
*I LOVED SKY*
MY CHILDHOOD
who else didnt know her existed till they watched Dan's video
im a simple person, I saw LDShadowLady and I clicked
NOOOOO MY CHILDHOOOD MY CHILDHOOD 👹
Dan is the best
Anthhony realy sed Nhaaaashu
LDShadowLady is the Queen of Minecraft!
My childhood.
Dude I'm 16 now and I still sometimes kicks back and watch og Dan vids or Smosh vids
You should do spend a day with stampy.
MY MINECRAFT FATHER
Rippp no yogscast
I personally was never into Minecraft. I knew it was big back in the day but I was 15/16 when it became public and I was in a different headspace and assumed it was a preschool game created by Steam. I knew nothing about it in hindsight.
I wss too young to watch yt at that time, but now, they are currently building my childhood... Legends never Die !
only if pat was here
Xs adventures in Minecraft will always be my og
yeah lizzie doesn’t swear or at least not often in current videos so it’s always a shock watching her old stuff and her swearing, it’s funny.
Where was stanmy :(
I just love that fact that Adam hasn't changed one bit.
get stampy, popularmmos, captainsparklez on heree
Anthony your making me feel really old I can’t believe their first videos where that long ago and I used to watch them
I had no clue these people are now old mcyts (especially ldshadowlady) they raised me.
Shoutout Dr. Tryaurus
Lizzie ur the best! Ur so cute and adorable!😊 😊
I love skydoes Minecraft he was the first ever Minecraft YouTubed I watched
DanTDM was my first ever subscription.  I remember waking up early before school so I would have time to watch the new DanTDM video.  Wow those were the days.
I’m a girl gamer.
I miss sky and his videos:(
21:00 THIS ALBERT🤣
I miss Sky :(
Etho is more legendary than these people.
I was today years old when I found out that Post Malone was part of Team Crafted 😲
Oof that always happens when I put effort into any vid the views go 📉📉📉and when I don’t try it’s just goes 📈📈📈
Dream: *✌️👁👄👁*
I am proud to say that DanTDM was my childhood 🥺✨
Please do a video with stampy. That would be such a good video
what did the ceiling ever do to you..
I was at one of Dan’s tours in 2016 or 15 in Scotland
OML SKYYYYY
Invite philza
Adam still has that same since of humor and it's glorious
seeing sky makes me sad. he was a big part of my childhood and i know he went through  a lot, but im concerned for him now i hope he is safe:(
ni HA chu
Anthony padilla : og minecrafters  Meanwhile stampy:   *They never invite the king*
I’m glad Adam is doing well, he has been through a lot personally and on the internet, I look forward to his music
just like juice, you can see the pain in adams laugh. i’m glad he’s doing great tho🙂
You sky and Dan changed my life man I’m not even kidding
kinda sad that stampy isnt on here but ah well.
So like, Sky lived with Post Malone, and I have never heard the both of then talk about it, and so in just finding out like about 5 years later???
Nah I feel like Lizzie is still the same old self, but she's right, a lot less cringy
Albert!
wheres stampppppppppy
Its crazy cause i watched them when i was 10 and im 17 now 😭
If you ever do a part 2 you have to get stampy on
OMG I noticed 1:10 LShadowLady posted video on My 8 year old birthday 😂🥳  DanTDM is the one there build up My childhood. He is amazing. He were one of the reasons i got intrested in getting minecraft and play it ❤️
LD SHADOW LADY:people move on  ME: i have not moved on dan from 3 and a half year
Damn it's good to see Sky.
Hey I’m just here to announce the death of Brandon Asher, also known as Bashurverse. He passed away from CODVID-19. He was an amazing minecraft youtuber and player and was one of the many Minecraft you tubers that turned him into what Minecraft was today. May he Rest In Peace. 🍉❤️
Damn we all probably started watching Adam when was 12 or 13 well at least I did. now we are either 20 or 19 years old💀
Wow
Adam's such a cool dude lmao I love him
Every time Adam was on the screen it was amazing lol.
So much respect for Adam, they changed so many peoples lives for the better. They 100% made my childhood.
where’s popularmmos
Sky and Lizzie are two of the five people I contribute to getting me into Minecraft - getting huge nostalgia from when I was 10 rn
i love these niggas.
only og's remember bacon man
Rip dans mod reveiw
i wish popularmmos was there but still a great vid
Younger me is screaming, I was such a fan of all these people for so long
Sky I have a deep respect for, he’s been through a lot and right now is living his best life.
Did Dan make a children’s book about Minecraft cause there is a kids book about him and Minecraft
Is it still worth watching team crafted videos? Because i didn't watch it
Man, I just realized, you NEED to do one of these with zackscottgames
I always loved watching sky’s modded cops and robber
BUTTER
Omg it’s honestly so nice to see Adam happy again because he was my childhood! I still remember this one game sky did and I followed him around and he screamed my name kiekie kiekie for a good 30 second and it made my day ❤️ thanks sky for making my childhood so amazing
You know who's an OG minecraft youtuber? STAMPYLONGNOSE or (HEAD)
For people who don’t know Sky uses they/them pronouns and LDshadowlady is bi! Just some things that make me feel valid
Lizzie was definitely a part of my childhood but I so wish that people like cupquake was included- or people from the cube smp, omg the cube- please tell me I’m not the only one who remembers that 🥲
Im glad sky is doing okay i thought he was in a bit of a bad spot for abit
Butter gang bitches
Lizzie is still my favorite even after all these new Minecrafters came on the scene. There is just something about her videos that always bring me joy.
Can you do jeromeasf
I’ve been watching Lizzie for 7 years now and I’ll never not love her😂 she’s been sick a huge part of my childhood
Imagine skydoesminecraft telling you that he is a big fan :)
Dantdm was the guy who introduced me in the gaming world and minecraft too
You could really do a part 2 with EVEN MORE OG youtubers like Stampy, Ssundee,  Jerome whatever
Love the video i just needed to see stampy in the vid.... maybe the next videooo
LDshadowlady was essentially my second mother
I love lizze
They better than fucking dsmp
ADAM IF YOURE SOMEHOW READING THIS TELL ALBERT I LOVE THEM
I love minecraft but cant and will not be able to buy it
Popularmmos been real quiet
get stampy on here
4:50
Love the insane energy Sky gives off, remind me to check his stuff in october.
Okay, obviously I know trayoraus didn’t actually talk but it still hurts for Dan to stay that.
If they do a part 2 they should get popularmmos
DanTDM was my childhood. He had a major impact on my creativity and my life. Thank you so much Dan!
Sky is the reason I am who I am today. He gave me a great childhood :)
DANTDM!!!!!!!!!!!
YES DAN!!!!!
Popularmmos
HE SHOUD DO THIS WITH SIMS PLAYERS SEEN AS SIMS HAS BEEN A GAME SINCE 2000S AND HAS CHANGED THE WORLD IF HE DOES HE SHOULDE GET PLUMBELLA LIL SIMSIE JAMES TURNER OR DELIGRACY
Adam is literally the only reason why I got into YouTube till this day  He hasn't been active, hopefully at that time he's spending more time with his son and some of his newer friends, hopefully they're supporting Adam  Ever since then, I started to move to MrBeast's channels, they had a similar flare as SkyDoesMinecraft before 2016. Awesome, but different Love SkyDoesMinecraft till the end
Adam, Lizzie, and Dan are literally my childhood. I was watching them when I was like 11, and I still watch them to this day.i like be them so much and thank you to all of them for getting me through the toughest part of my life.
I’ve been watching Dan since I was 3  and I’m twelve now it was like his 2nd or third year of yt
I was expecting PopularMMOs to be here with these creators.
I still watch lizzie and dan hehe
I really wish stampylongnose ( now stampylonghead) could be here lmao-
Sky is literelly my child hood.  His and anthony talking, it was like just friends talking it was barely an interview i love that😂
Skydoesminecraft was the first person who introduced me to minecraft. I was like an 11 year old kid at the time and minecraft was only like 2 years old. Adam is such a jolly soul who loves to laugh and I love that about him.
lizzie was definitely the one who got me into Minecraft, i’ve been a shadow cadet for more than 5 years now
dantdm was my childhood youtuber, i watched him play minecraft, roblox, happy wheels and skate
I'm more frustrated when my og childhood YouTubers video aren't peaking then them jeez I'm obsessed
I CLICKED BECAUSE I'M A LDSHADOWLADY CADET!!!
I love how Sky's just vibin throughout the video, its hella nostalgic
WERES STAMPY
X, Seananners. Nuff said
Sky had a MASSIVE impact on my life and its very sad to see no one really watches him any more
Dr Trayaurus isn’t real? Dan wha what why I mean I feel weird
You should do a solo interview with stampy long nose
no one talking abotu how he spelled trayaurus wrong
Lizzie basically raised me, her videos and herself really set the foundation of my childhood and what my hobbies and interests have become, I love her so much
Adams Humor and Energy is still the Same. I love them so much dude
Where my boy stampy
I miss SkyDoesMinecraft...he was a part of my childhood but he disappeared :(
where tf is stampy
Dont forget too about the minecraft roleplays back then like explodingtnt goldenarmor and more
Man I wish you could've gotten Simon and lewis from the Yogscast on here
Stampy and Dan were THE gateway for me learning about minecraft
i love how sky brought up the team crafted boys.... and post malone.
Anyone else notice Lizzie is wearing a wig?
adam is so chaotic. i love it
I still remember watching lizzy and DanTDM with my younger siblings! They inspired so many people with me and they will always stay in my heart! They were my childhood! <3
DanTDM changed my childhood, introduced me to video games
WHERES STAMPY
Love ldshadowlady
Dan was fav but it's not dan it's somebody
The times when i watched dan were the times i was lonely... but svery time i watched his videos it made me happy... last time i watched him i watch  7 streams of him playing animal crossing... i look forward to checking out his channel again
Love this
Dan and markeplier is the reason im still here
The kids who watched the OG Minecrafters are now popular Minecrafters themselves
There actually legendary
Dan and sky were my life
Lest go Dan
i am crying right now- i did not expect to cry but i am crying right now-
Hi dan
LEGENDS NEVER DIE! 🤩🥰
Dantdm still does Minecraft to this day
522 dream stans disliked.
Lizzie is i belive my first ever youtuber i watched, i have now watched her for 9 years and dont regret any moment of it, also when she released youtooz i begged my mom for one because i am a minor so i cant buy anything online she said she will think but in 2 days it was too late, they were all sold out and i cried because of that honestly :C
Lizzie is truly an inspiration for me^^
Where is ssundee
all of these people were literally my childhood. their such a blessing to us <3
That intro when Anthony falls from the roof will never get old lol
Ldshadowlady will forever be my fav Minecraft YouTuber I just wish she would post a little more not a ton just a little
LIZZIE
Ok but random moment , Lizzie looks gorgeous in this.
ughhhh sky was my whole childhood omgggggg i miss him
ughhhh sky was my whole childhood omgggggg i miss him
ive never seen anyone interview the krew, i feel like they're never mentioned even though they also have been on youtube for a LONG time
Ok ok but where’s stampy
Sky was literally my childhood, I’m glad they were the person i grew up with
Dan had such an impact on me, I fr love him and his content sm
I love that Ldshadowlady still updates to this day. I’ve been watching her for like 8 years and sense I was 10. I still love to watch her videos.
man im still watching dan till this day
I've been following both Lizzie and Dan for as long as I can remember and I'm happy to say I still watch them, both my favorite mc YouTubers 😌
i remember seeing adams bacon man video. it was hide n seek😭😭😭 i miss my childhood.
No stampy
You should invite @Smallishbeans he's amazing and is Lizzie's husband
POST MALONE?!
Lizzie raised me when my mom was always screaming and yelling at me tbh
"this is albert"
I never thought I see the day when DanTDM meets one of Smosh's co-founders
Yayayayyyaahyaheyeyyeyasyyesyesyee
I keep going back to Anthony’s channel every now and then and man is it one of the best parts of my day
This makes me feel old, i wish i can just rewind time.
Sky was legit my childhood
the fact that i grew up with these guys original content,when adam was still making videos with ross and max and jin,when ldshadowlady was making shadowcraft videos,when dan was still doing the trayurass skits like wow the good time
These people were so many childhoods they are LEGENDS (Dan and sometimes Lizzie are/were mine)
LDshadowlady Stan Here <3
How the hell you forgot Philza he literally created minecraft
Me and my brother really liked watching sky when we were little… our mom wasn’t a huge fan though lmao
Lizzie and Dan: Shoutout to These lovely people! Adam: aLbErT.
oh my god, the nostalgia in this video. Sky influenced me so much. my favorite videos of him were his try not to laugh ones.
Lizzie is my life I never stopped watching her
Cool video! Also, it would be really cool if you talk about Ihascupquake She has done so much, being a minecraft queen, being an artist and so much more haha
Who else used to think that trayaurus was an actual A.I that Dan got from a mod.
YOU NEED TO GET TOMMY IN HERE DUDE!
I still go back to LDShadowladys channel and watch her old Gary’s mod videos bc I found those absolutely hilarious bro.
3:35 dan being a loner got him fame lol
Adam has really just not lost his humor
Gunna go subscribe to Albert
Do stampycat
I still watch Lizzie
Excuse me SIRRRR it's not pronounced niHachu it's pronounced niyachu but it's written nihachu
Yk how ramboos style is weird ya he’s a fashion icon to young kids let that sink in He wears mask a lot, has long hair, hoodies and sweaters kinda like a colourful emo
I wish stampy cat was in the video him and these creators literally rised me
i’m a simple human, i see ldshadowlady and i click.
Where is stampy
I grew up w Lizzie and Dan, they're such sweethearts:(
I really miss Adam honestly  They still make me laugh just like they did when I was a child
Why is popularmmos here
Anthony forgot about the most OG Minecraft YouTuber. Paulsaursjr. He made the first Minecraft let’s play.
My most favorite is skydoesminecraft,bro his scream of terror makes me laugh
just so people know, Sky now uses they/them pronouns
He should have had popularMMOs
I really admire Lizzie and how passionate and in tune she still seems to be with herself and her content after all these years. She seems really chill. I'd love to have that sort of mindset when i'm older <3
I used to love all these minecrafter and they're the ones that got me into the game. And to be honest I didn't just stop watching they're videos I just kinda grew up and stoped watching YouTube altogether I still love them and I might actually watch LDShadowlady again bc I did really love her videos
When Lizzie Sweared: 👁👄👁
i love lizzie so much. she has had such an impact on my life and i’ve been watching her videos since 4th grade
ok, but can we talk about HER HAIR?? It's like a drawing
Nah bro you forgot the most important one
i was quite a sad child but watching youtube really made me happier. i owe a lot of that to skydoesminecraft and obviously he won’t know me at all but i’ll never forget what he’s done for me , even if it was indirectly
PopularMMOs where😳
now that you’ve spent a day with Minecraft Youtubers you should spend a day with roblox Youtubers! like flamingo or temprist (just an idea)
When Anthony said "Smosh" my head looked up. (I had this running in the background)
I also remember the shit sky was going through and I'm so glad to see he's in a much better place.
Grew up watching skydoesminecraft and Honestly, if I had never stumbled across his channel, I'd be a completely different person because I used to mad shit talk minecraft lmao. Man literally helped in forming the person I am
Dan is just a legend, someone give him an award.
DANTDM Is literally my childhood I remember waiting at exactly 10 for his video to be uploaded, ❤❤
Guys....I think I know why they asked for her to sign a zucchini
DanTdm, skydoesminecraft, and ihascupquake were my childhood frr
Can you do stampylonghead next??
Man I’ve been a ldshadowlady fan since I was a little kid and I looked up to Lizzie and thought she was so cool because *I* liked video games and she made the content that I wanted to make she was so funny and we had the same type of humor (plus I loved her building style and the cute builds she would make) and I also loved that there wasn’t lots of “SUBSRIBE AND LIKE BLAH BLAH BLAH”  and clickbait type stuff because that stuff really annoyed child me She was one of the only big female gamers at the time (I was also a big ihascupquake, yammy, and laurenzside fan) and that was really inspiring :)  That was really rambley but Lizzie is so cool I’ve been watching her forever and you should subscribe👍
Seriously, DanTDM taught me English, I used to watch him every single day. Such a legend.
If you had CaptainSparklez, JeromeASF, and Bajan Canadian it would be lit
Real OGs!
The OGs of Minecraft at the top of my mind that I’ve watched:  SkyDoesMinecraft LDShadowlady Little Kelly and Carly Aphmau AviatorGaming Stampy Ross (can’t remember his full user) Captain Sparkles DanTDM PopularMMOs It’s Funneh
sky’s cops and robber videos were the best in my opinion
WOOOOOO LIZZIE! just her and Joel are goals in life
adam was a giant part of my childhood and its so lovely to see that man hasn't changed personality wise, i did cry a bit because it sent me back to when i was a kid watching his hide and seek videos, or his mod videos. :')
Somoh
You need to do stampy he was the 🐐
LDShadowLady: Shoutout to my fans Dan: Shout out to Dr Treyaurus Adam: Albert
I like how Adam acts like how i think he would in interviews. Really seems like he's in a far better shape
Sky really helped me a lot. As a kid, as a teen and now as an adult. Really appreciate him with all his help, his humour, his chaoticness. The guy is really a legend
Love how sky actually challenged pewds in terms of popularity
My dad still says butter for gold, i remember how happy i was to be in a video of his just in the background
Some more OG Minecrafters that I THINK should be in this video are PopularMMOs and Ssundee Edit: Dans Son will be The New DanTDM
where was popularmmos?
dan and lizzie man like omg im so og straight up
That is so true!! My most FAV Minecraft youtubers was ldshadowlady and Aphmau! ~
WHERE IS STAMPY AND IBLISTICSQUIQ
You should do one with stampylonghead
when Lizzie said Courgettes and then corrected herself for Anthony and said Oh zuccini 😂
I still have my DanTDM plush and TubeHero and im 16. Im not ashamed. I havent watched a Dan video in like 3 years but he was such a big part of my life. He practically raised me lol
bro that’s wilddd
Man, I got into Minecraft because of The Yogscast back in the day, holy shit what a throwback
STAMPY!?
Oh my gosh...MY HEROS..dang I missed them so much. I'm glad there all doing great. :D wish he would have put APHMAU or STAMPY in
If you do a part two we NEEEEED to see Aphmau, PopularMMOs, and Stampy 😫
WHERE R STAMPY AND SQUID
Well I mean theyre still kinda legendary
DanTDM, my favourite YouTuber and childhood in an Anthony padilla vid is a dream come true
Since Albert is Adams dog I guess you could say it's a butter dawg
holy shit, sky. I havent seen this guy since i was like 12
Sad Tobuscus isnt on here
Adam is 100% one of the reasons I had a somewhat okay youth. His videos helped me in some of my darkest times and made me able to laugh when I needed it most. Proud fan since the beginning when he started his first survival series :)
really wish stampycat was here
I've watched Lizzie when I was 10 and she is still my favorite YouTuber nothing will change  Even she quit yt
I never made the calculations before because I loved LDshadowLady when I was younger but I just realised that I've been watching her for over a decade. I found her from ZackScottGames.
Sky omggggg 😂😂 love him omg talking with ranboo tommy and niki yessssss
Love how they talk about dream smp but love the old type of the Minecraft and stuff
Sky saying he’s gonna add Minecraft stuff to his music tho
Lizzie love her for how she is even if she was cringy I loved it and sky he made aphs YouTube channel with Ross and stuff just cool and awesome and he’s so funny for no reason
Are we gonna talk about how Adam is casually holding a $3200 mic 😳
Lizzie and Dan were a large impact on my life
HERE, ANTHONY IS FUCKING HERE.  FUCK
You should make another one of these with stampy and popularmmos
I met Fucking Dantdm wich i used to laugh at but now its such a brag
You get to shoutout go Sky: this is Edward
Surviving the first night by bluexephos (yogscast) was when I learned of Minecraft
Seeing bacon man made me die a little inside. A blast from the past
:0
16:03 haha bmth refrence
Popularmmos should be here
THE CHELSEA'S SMILE REFERENCE LMAO
i still watch lizzy i havent moved on yet
16:02 LOVE THAT!  My cousin use to watch DanTDM. Can't believe he's got a kid!!
Lizzie is my favourite YouTube and still I watch her all the time but I loved her videos xx
My childhood😭😭
I'm only here because of Lizzie.
Bruh stampy would’ve been PERFECT for this video. Collectively Dan and Stampy made my childhood
He needs to go back to visit that squid
so cool seeing what sky has been up to wish the best for him love u adam <3
bro Adam still has his energy XD so many memories
I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH
For me it was Stampy, Dan, and PopularMMOs
To this day one of my most vivid memories from my childhood was going to see Dan when he went on tour
You should have gotten the three god DanTDM, Stanpy, Popularmmos
Damn Adam really shaped my sense of humour at the age of 9.... I'll be 18 this year and he still makin me giggle
sky and his cops vs robbers videos brang us joy
Wheres stampy
Waiting for one with vanoss 🥲
Bro where’s stampy
Dan don’t quit mincraft when your sons 13 think of all the clickbait
Most people: Ted my favourite YouTubers are there  me: where the fuck is stampy
We can all say we watched these 3 when we where like 4 or 3 I know I did
I hope aphmau and stampy are there if he dose another one
I’m so happy you let DanTDM be in this video!!! He the first YouTube I ever watched who made Minecraft videos! He’s the reason why I’m a minecrafter now!
I thought Doofensmirtz and Weird Al was the ultimate crossover…..  *”DanTDM and Anthony Padilla”*
I still watch LDshadowlady on the regular, she's honestly super funny
Man wished there was even more og mc youtubers like SSundee or popularmmos or even taurtus
Wait a minute are you from Smosh...?
Stampy and Dan raised me :')
You should probably do people who play Roblox
Stampylongnose...
you spelled trayaurus wrong
the good old days... :(
Next thing you know Adam and post on a song 😂
newer mc youtubers are trash
I’m watching a Mod showcase as soon as this video’s over. They were the only Minecraft videos that I found interesting.
what about popularmmos
it’s cute. Wish they could’ve gotten pat and Jen, stampy and ssundee. I still appreciate them all though!      P. S. I love zackscott, his pvz was great ;-;
Jordan should have been here smh
I hope sky is doing ok especially from the drama alert stuff
Ayo next time get Popularmmos and Jen on here
Sky and his group were so much apart of my childhood. Then I started watching the Vanoss crew and still do till this day.
My entire childhood in 1 video

Omg this video made me so happy! It made me realize how much I used to watch them! I remember watching Lizzie and Dantdm in 2014-2017! I still watch their videos sometimes too! Also I’m so glad to see Dan has a son now!!!! 🥺🥺🥺
I wish Stampy was here:(
Anthony: What's been your most bizarre fan experience?  Sky: Locked in a bathroom in Minecon Dan: A fan asks me if I'm DanTDM while I'm peeing Lizzie: People have me sign vegetables
I miss adam SO MUCH
so when me and my brother were way younger we had this cat he absolutely loved and that cat died to an illness. he cried for hours (also hes older then me by two years) so the way we got him to calm down was we sat in a corner on top of this vent (it was winter) and watched dantdms diamond dimensions series. me and him spent hours binge watching dan daily he really did make up our childhood as a whole.
I still have DanTDM's book!!!
1:44 Bruhhhhh This is why sky is still my favorite in till this dayXD
Spend a day with Bo Burnham! I saw a comment of yours that you are a fan, and combining his incredibly interesting personality and life with your awesome questions would be very cool :)
these people legit raised me
Call SSundee, Crainer, Jelly in video
You should really get Stampy on here some day!
I feel captain and bajan should also come
DanTDM was the first youtuber I ever watched consistently. That was so many years ago, I’m happy to see he’s still making stuff
DanTDM made my childhood
Seeds don’t make smth a fruit😭😭
Roblox players??!
The most legendary og minecrafter, popularmmos, wasn't here unfortunately.
i just love taking a look into the like whole story or Mindcraft you tube creators!!!!!! Aaahhh so awesome
“My fav YTber Dan aalways gives a smile to my face”-og fan aka me
LDShadowLady is still awesome to watch and her husband SmallishBeans
<) tesla
Adam singlehandedly carried my childhood on his shoulders.
ADAMMMMM!!!
We should make another smp with a way older version of Minecraft with the new bois vs the og bois
I remember I used to watch Sky when I was like 10 or 11 or something and the thing is I didn't speak a word of english back then but I still thought he was the funniest minecraft youtuber
He spent more money on fixing the roof that he keeps breaking than money he made in his YouTube career
I can Agree I loved DanTDM I have watched all of his video and mostly re-watched all of his video cuz i'm mostly a dumb ass.
Dan was my dad  Sky is my uncle  Trayurus was my borther   Grim was our family pet pat and jen was my sisters
man its been so long since ive seen LDShadowLady
I love how Lizzies PFP hasn’t changed for like 9 years
Omg Lizzie!
i’ve missed seeing sky content guys
OMG as soon as y saw ldshadowlady/Lizzie and DanTDM a instantly clicked on the vid
Stamps was up there with them
Where’s stamps?
Post malone😂😂😂
I don't know any of these three people from my childhood, because English isn't my first language. But I think if I'd have spoken that language from the beginning, they would've impacted my life in a big way. They seem really nice xD
I miss the shut up and Anthony in smosh
i started watching sky around 10 years ago when he started and i stopped around 3 years ago i watched him every day
Albert
What a time that was to be alive
It's not like we forgot about you guys. It's more like we just grew up and moved on to the next thing. Thank you for being my childhood <3
A L B E R T
I Remember Back When I Started Watching Dan’s Stuff When I Was But A Little Baby Taco. His Videos On Minecraft Horror Maps, Mods, Fnaf, Those Videos Are As Special To Me As Old Vids By Markiplier, EthGoesBoom, RyeRye99, FuturisticHub(I Watched His Content YEARS Before I Found Out He Was A Dick BTW), And RejectedShotgun. Even Though I’m Only 14, Oddly Enough, I Feel A Little Older Than That, Especially When I Look Back At The Stuff I Used To Watch On YouTube.
As A TDM Fan.... THIS MAKES ME SQEE...
Dan and LD: calm chilling talking about things  Sky: *chaotic screeching*
Damn this video was awesome to watch
Imagine these legends joining the dream smp.
I miss coming home from school in 2014 and immediately google searching ldshadowlady to check if lizzie uploaded because i didnt know how to make an email or yt account. Like she was my childhood im so happy that she’s still thriving 😭😭
A l b e r t
dan ,lizzie ,sky and with their friends honestly made my childhood amazing and really comforting <33
havent watched ldshadowlady in like 5 years, I used to be obsessed like watching all of her videos twice over and being upset if I was 10 minutes late to a release.  it's weird seeing her now lmao, her hair isnt pink anymore whack
Bruh Squid was DEFINITELY what got me into Sky
20:59 IT'S ALBERT I LOVE ALBERT
It would be cool if you did technoblade in this!!!
Bro you forgot PopularMMOs
Sky hasn’t changed he is the whole energy of this video
adam. we need to know how much acid u took for this.
Um... no condescension intended at all, but is Sky okay??
Adam wasn't living with Post Malone. He was truly living with Pre Malone
The youtube anylatics are quite really simple
Who else wishes stampy was here?
Omg I can’t express how happy I am to see Adam with a bit of his “old” energy back. Like “this is Albert” and having so much randomness with a splash of unadulterated joy is the vibe that carried me through highschool man. Super hype for his music too, can’t wait.
I can't believe it's been 10 years...
Squid and butter shaped me as a person. Welp, time to go watch some old school mod showcases
Sky lokey reminds me of jschlatt
as someone with a dead channel, i feel when they said "its scary seeing the numbers declining putting your heart and soul into it"
I saw dantdm on tour in 2016, it was so cool. I got a pug plushie and still have it
me who has been watching dantdm since 2013👁👁
Dream ruined minecraft for me
Lizzie helped me so much
happy to see sky just takin it easy, dude really deserves it still making me laugh to this day :)
Just 3 OGs being interviewed by an even older OG, no big deal
Dan was one of my biggest inspirations for art when I was a kid, and now I go to art school. Dan was a big part of my childhood.
I LOVED LDSHADOWLADY WHEN I WAS LITTLE
20:27 i knew this🧍🏻‍♀️
I kinda miss dogcraft and the mods from popularmmos
Honestly to this day I still watch Lizzie and Dan, don’t get me wrong I really love the dream smp but it will never have the same feeling as these Ogs do
10:12
Yay
Lizzie: im past my peak  Also lizzie: got 28M (her most viewed as of now) just 6 months ago
Watif you interview filipino youtubers/streamers/animators
I spend a day with smosh????
stampylonghead basically raised me, haven’t watched him in six years…
MY CHILDHOOD!!
"You have 5 seconds to promote anything you want go" Adam: This is Albert
**childhood intensifies**
Next can you please do a part two! With gaming with Jen and popularmmos?
This made me cry- id watch each and every single one and go back when I’m bored or feel nostalgic because I know these people will always bring my joy back up, I hope to be like them ngl, ( ˘ ³˘)♥︎
LDshadowlady and Dan shaped my life
I'm 18 now and Dantdm truly was my life when I was like 10
Literally everyone here was apart of my childhood, and they're still apart of my lives(I still watch them all when they upload-)
:c wish you got stampy long nose
Lizzie was (and still is) a big part of my life, I continuously watch her videos and her older videos and I wish she knew how much I appreciate her. I still have a signed poster of Lizzie and Joel 💟
Say what you want about dream, but these people started the community. Fell off the community because i felt whats left is dream smp and scripted shit. God so cringe
Bro when Dan talked to Dr Trayauraus I was like "wait villagers can talk?" 🤣🤣 Good times
Ah.. I miss watching Dan when he's jusy chillin in the lab w Trayaurus man.. ah.. good ol days when minecraft creators are just still much more simpler but as enjoyable..
Could you possibly do a separate video for Adam? There's so much about his career that wasn't mentioned and the crowd deserves to know how incredible he is.  EDIT: This didn't age well.
I love to see that Adam hasn’t changed one bit in over 7 years
4:59 - So the whole time when we first meant Austin he was just Austin and then he became The Post Malone, that is incredible, which makes me wonder; has Sky ever gone to a Post Malone concert and said "Hey it's me Sky/Adam remember me. we used to hang out and we even made a trick or treat video"
12 year old me is shaking rn! Crazy seeing Anthony of Smosh with SkyDoesMinecraft and TheDiamondMinecart.
isn’t it sort of funny how the thumbnail says 25.1 billion views, when there are not even 8 billion people on earth. given that at least 1 billion people probably don’t have access to internet or a device and possible another half billion for people who just don’t care. you would be at then 6.5 billion people on earth that have access to internet and have a device, which means 6.5 billion people would have to watch this video more than once for the thumbnail to not be clickbait.
Please make a part 2 this was amazing, Would love to see StampyCat or Aphmau!
Hey Adam I don’t know if you will like through these comments or not, but your videos helped me out through the time right after my grandma past.  It was more of your gta videos that brought me joy for the first time in a while and I just want to thank you for that.
Im glad that Adam is happy now after all of the drama in his life.
omg my actually childhood..........
lizzie is awesome!!
I’ve been watching ldshadowlady since I was 7 and still do till this day
a video of the greats   truly brilliant video
Didnt expect to see liz here but I'm not disappointed.
Bro your hair sucks
now when will he talk to the Yogscast about Minecraft and ask them when the new Shadow of Israphel ep is going to come out
It’s weird to think that I’ve been watching lizzie for over 7 years 😂
Hell yeah shoutout to Dr. T, shoutout to Grim too
I remember watching Dan is 2nd grade!! It is so crazy how much he has grown! I remember that his series w dr treuaris (Ik I spelt it wrong dont come after me) was my favorite thing to watch!
My childhood
Part 2??? CaptainSparklez, Bajancanadian, etc??
Still wish CaptainSparklez was interviewed. I mean: "Creeper, Aw man!"
All my childhood. Especially Dan and Lizzie
Ya’ll remember Dr. Trayaurus’s old lab? And the weird mailman? And grim?
This video is one of the best things I’ve ever watched. This comment section is amazing too. All the other content creators and people taking the words out of my mouth. It’s awesome
Lizzie was my childhood. I still watch her every time she posts. She's amazing, honestly <3
How about CaptainSparklez? I know he's pretty busy but I remember him being pretty legendary and og
god i miss sky lol
Amateurs
ethoslab
I learned all my bad words from sky does Minecraft
He should've invited pat or stampy
This is the best ever crossover episode I’ve seen since the Phineas and Ferb effect and Family Guy Star Wars
My best friend is obsessed whit LDshadowlady and she was the first YouTube I watched. She makes my day every time she uploaded.
They are my childhood 🧐🍷
16:02 who's chelsea? Are they someone who's a part of the "I spend a day with" series crew?
I want to see Stampy and PopularMMos hop on the interview
thess sad
where is stampylonghead
ive loved LDShadowLady for yearssss i still watch her <33
I’m surprised Stampy wasn’t there
Great video keep up the good work!
4:50, thats so outta pocket, tf is post malone doing lol
lulz
i remember meeting sky after his performance at minecon 2013 and he wasn't joking when he said fans chased him it was insane
What about jordan?
FINALLY NO DREAM
Lizzie has reached her final form: Socially awkward girl who lives in a giant forest and only eats food from her garden
Sky's parts in the video are always so hype and energized I love it
You gotta get stamps
Dr. Trayaurus, not Treyaurus
I love Adam he’s so fucking funny
My cousin recently said that he was watching this "New Youtube Guy" called DanTDM. I think he was a little concerned about how excited I got. Dan was my childhood, and I'm so happy that he's still here for the people who need him
Wait I thought sky quit it Minecraft
Popularmmos and Gamingwithjen tho, I miss them
I’ve been watching sky does Minecraft for a very long time and Dan TDM for a How long time  and PewDiePie And Stampy long nose until I made my channel
This is so cool! Personally i watched PopularMMOs but these guys (especially Dan) are great as well!
what dan said about his son's identity is so sweet and so thoughtful, i luv him omg 🥺<3
Where Stampy?
I didn’t see stampy 😧
I didn’t see techno 😧
what about  stampylonghead
I promise I've been watching DanTDM for 8years
Top 10 youtubers who swear
Anthony: swear.  Dan: *intense sweating*
Ew netnobody 🤮
Lizzie was the first content creator I have ever watched on YouTube so she, alongside with Dan and Sky, mean a lot to me. Even though they aren't in their primes I still love their videos. I don't think I would ever get sick of them, they just mean so much to me!
Albertttt
Should've done ssundee would've been epic
I’m so sad stampy was not there
Hi dantdm uk LODON SVERIGE merch plush
Plssss anothony come back to smosh plsss😭😭😭😭😭
im a simple girl i see dan i click
Anyone remember deadlox
Lizzy is the reason i am still alive
HE FORGOT STAMPY
I think it’s funny how we more or less have setup the next generation of minecrafters so that the next generation of YouTube viewers can enjoy the games we oh so love
TALK WITH APHMAUUUUUU PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
i miss dan's crazy craft =(
Man I still remember when dan broke his hand
dude dan was my insperation to start youtube hes amazing ive also been to the aus show with the evil twin brother hes the best
Even if I've only watched for 2 years, I'm so glad to see Lizzie here and she's just so well spoken ✨
Trayorus can’t talk nooooo
DanTDM fl
these are all my fav youtubers and even if they stop posting or quit ill never forget the memories i had watching all of them since i have 3  ❤
Jeart
PopularMMOs and Stampy were my introductions to Minecraft  And that was how I got into Dan's stuff
I am pretty triggered cuz stampy, ash, and squid aren’t here, although ash stopped mc and is not fam friendly anymore, I miss the other og legends, they create my childhood
dantdm was like a second dad to me
I like dan, he makes childhood’s and stuff, i think that’s his job, I like it, I have watched him for 7 years
Where is stampylongnose
damn nostalgia hit like a truck
god watching this makes me feel so old, I remember one of my oldest remaining memories was my older sister handing me a tablet with the block game up on the screen when I was only 5 or so, then being unable to figure out how to break blocks. Now I'm sitting here talking about how they can break dream out of prison with the moss block and thinking, wait the elytra was released in 2015!?!?
I was so exited when dan came up
Ldshadowlady literally kinda raised!!
Only a minute in and Adam’s voice feels like a hug for my heart haha 🥺
I wonder why he didn't invited ssundee he was also a og
omg bacon man im gonna cry     I miss Adam's mc vids
Only ogs know dan was in smosh
Bro 4:25 THIS JUST GAVE ME THE BIGGEST FLASH BLACK
Ogs
Should’ve got stampy as well as these lot
i miss the old minecrafters, modern minecrafters are kinda shit
When was the last time you could give Darth Sidious a hug?
dang when i wasprobably 10 i went to DanTDM on tour in brisbane dad bought me a hoodie and it was too big and it's only fitting me now XD.
YOOOOOOOOOOOO They look so... So old...?
sees ld shadowlady: gets way to much nostalgia like ANYONE REMEMBER CRAZY CARFT and the original 1 life );
Dan: "looking back at YouTube, it was such a different thing" *yes yes, dream SMP wasn't a thing*
These guys plus many more like team crafted , the pack, ashley M, and many more will forever hold a special place in my heart. If i had not found these guys as a kid idk where i would be right now
My average amount of views is like around 120 views something like that but about a month ago one of my gaming set tour got around 1.5k views that’s the most I’ve had so far
Omg anthony and DanTDM my best dream ever
DO ONE WITH STAMPY
LMAO IM SO SORRY BUT WHEN THEY ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE HIGHEST HIGHS DAN AND LIZZIE ARE HERE LIKE: yeah i got to go on a world tour, and meeting my fans was really rewarding yeah i got a character based on me and i got to voice it! i never though id be in a game you know.. AND SKY'S HERE LIKE  yEaH i GoT a LaMbO. bOiIiii I CANT AHAHISYDGOU
nih “aa” chu /j
sky is tripping balls
"Yeah music"
dan is literally the reason i started playing minecraft, i watched dan at maybe 100k? and his videos brought me so much joy that i just had to get minecraft. ty dan <3
I remember going to that DanTDM show when I was like 8 and absolutely loving it he was really my idol 😁 it’s a great memory to look back on!
Mhm shoutout to Dr. Tray to any DanTDM ogs out there
Adam: doesn't post anything for months  Also Adam:iN ThREe MoNThS!
DanTDM should do a video with Dream.
Who remembers when Trayaurus went to Prison lol
Sky: I think I can get 5b views  Dan: hmm what about 30b
“nihAchu”
Never forget Peggy <33
For me stampy and squid are my fav but i like dan too
i have seen just about every ldshadowlady video! I still watch her and i’m 13 and i started when i was 7
IT’S DR. TRAYAURUS
Wow seeing Sky brought back memories. It’s been about 8 years since I have watched. My dad said I couldn’t watch him cause he curses. I’m still subbed to him doe. (On my dads account)
Everyone remembers Stampy right, right-
Who’s here from dan’s 9yr on YT video
Legends
This editing is so f*cking good.
I love its so ominous but it ligit about Minecraft YouTubers
Hi 🙋!!!!!!!!
Sky is truly a legend among legends in minecraft history
why the hardcore clip
Stampy
sky seems like such a cool person to be around
stampy, wonder quest, my lovely world, squid and stampy's build battles and adventure maps, sky den, i love him sm  <3
But not the goat BAJANCANADIAN wooooow
These people raised me, they are my childhood
You can't just talk about legendary minecrafters and NOT include Etho
Should of have ssunddee
dan and lizzie literally raised me and i credit them for raising me more than my parents
where’s that arousexual video or whatever i wanna know what that is
Lizzie changed my life
I learned english from minecraft youtubers, especially Dan. So thank you very much.
DanTDM really hit, LIKE ACTUALLY HIT childhood so hard, his showcases and stories made me decide to write stories and stuffs
Now we need Pat, Stampy, Sqaishey and Squid!
Loved it so much!! seeing them happy brings me so much joy, I would have loved it if they could have done four people and the fourth being stampylonghead
I'm still subbed to dan after 7 years im thankful for all the memories he gave me
I KINDA WANT TO JUST LIKE THANK ALL OF THESE YOUTUBERS,  as theyve all been an really big part on my childhood and from me personally i wanna thank them.  THANK YOU LIZZIE FOR STILL BEING LIZZIE!! i do indeed still watch your videos!! you're the youtuber i've been watching for the longest that im still active on!! Every video you make gets me really excited no matter how long it takes to upload, every video is amazing and you make it all incredibly better, i love you so much, thank you for everything!  DANTDM! I Literally lived off your videos for so long, i'd watch them  constantly and i would always get really excited for an upload by you, it was nice to see you'd uploaded to frequently but you always kept the  videos in amazing shape, you're RP with Dr trayurous (don't know how to spell the name i am so sorry) really formed my childhood up as my and my brothers who watched your videos for ages still make references to things about it that always lights up the mood.   SKYDOESMINECRAFT YOUR videos where extremely fucking funny, the times you'd play with aphmau would have me laughing really hard, and  you'd always just seem so natural and funny we all enjoyed every little  bit of it, i didn't watch you as much as i could have desired, but every time i did watch a video, i loved it thoroughly.   THANK YOU ALL!! i love you all so much. :]
Sky does Minecraft was my childhood ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sky was one of the reasons I made my parents get me Minecraft. I was addicted to his videos. And ihascupquake also was a HUGE influence on me and another reason I bought the game.
20:26 YO WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS HAHAHHA
lizzie could not upload for months and still get millions of views
To that one person if u see this who said “wait ur alive?!” I love u oml that made me laugh so hard timestamp for context: 13:00
Omg BACON MAN 4:14 Memories
Could you think about doing one with popularMMOs?He is my childhood
Sky was 100% my childhood and others but he was mine and seeing his face just brought back so many amazing memories. I honestly miss his content. He made me laugh he made my days amazing and it hurt knowing he quite Minecraft. But sky i honestly want to thank you for all the laughs you caused from me. I will never forget you. I love you ❤️
stampylonghead and ldshadowlady was my childhood though omg
Lizzy is honestly such a good lass,I remember watching her when I was younger and it making me so happy,it got me back into Minecraft and it gave me something to be happy about and I'll always be happy I discovered her
i never really grew out of my og mc 2015 phase and i’m glad i haven’t, it’s amazing to see my childhood still live on
I was there during Dan’s world tour and it was probably one of the greatest day of my life.
When I read that Sky was here I instantly clicked. I loved his content and still watch it today sometimes. :]
i used to watch dan so much as a kid i do go back to him sometimes when i feel like watching gaming vids
I started watching Lizzie about 6-7 years ago and I still watch her to this day. She’s my comfort person. Her videos are what I go to watch when I just want to escape from the world. I don’t ever plan on unsubscribing and I always plan on watching her videos! I just want to thank Lizzie for basically being involved (without knowing it lol) in creating the person I am!  P.S y’all should join her discord. Everyone there is so nice and supportive <3
Sky raised me, I miss him a lot
would’ve loved to see someone like bajancanadian on here
knee hu chu why did he say it like that lmao
ALBERT
Hearing those names just brought so many memories. Now we just need PopularMMOs
og? I STILL WATCH LDSHADOWLADY
Sky is such a vibe
Spending the day with smosh actors you should do that so smosh can be put back on it’s feet
People probably were fans of DanTDM but probably grew out of his content and wants more inappropriate but funnier content like Tommyinnit and the DreamSMP. But they still like DanTDM.
Why y’all so shock if Dan cusses in real life? Your parents do it and you probably do too.
I like how Adam spends his 5 seconds showing off his dog. The dog is cute also.  Edit: Guess he was abusing the dog pretty damn bad. Hope the dog is doing well and is safe these days.
It’s so cool to see the people who built our childhoods talk about their point of view
So i’m the only who was shook finding out post malone lived with a bunch of minecraft youtubers😭😭😭😭
sky was literally my childhood, i miss how happy he made me in my younger days lol
WHERE IS STAMPY?!!!!
I spent a day with Team Crafted? 🤔🤔🤔
I was really hoping for Stampy or Squid
Wait a minute Dan is only like 11 years older than me? God i feel old now
The only people missing for me is Stampy and SSundee
I watched Dan the most buy Sky was the reason I loved minecraft
he should’ve invited stampy omg
Wish you had more guests on, but amazing video with a great choice of creators! <3
where tf is stampy
Man, You didn't invites VenonExtreme, Feromonas and Monark?? That was a mistake lol
made me so sad watching this
DAN impacted me the most.....he was literally my childhood 😭😭
Waiting for Stampy and iBallisticSquid.  Tons of memories of my kids watching Dan and LDShadowLady. I also took my kids to Dan's tours and they had such a great time
You should do a video with grian
need to get one of these with JeromeASF, since he is still going super strong with 2 videos a day.
THIS IS ALBERT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Why did you not include stapycat he was my childhood
You should do coryxkenshin
Anybody thought Stampylongnose was going to be in this video?
Stampy and Dantdm were the minecraft youtubers that I always watched when I was a kid... The fun times
skydoesminecraft was 100% the start of my love for minecraft and ive played it since tthen
I hope everything works out for Adam
i was hoping stampy would have been on here
Where’s the captain ?
Fire interview 100/10
Sky was the king of Minecraft
Sky deserves so much for being part of our child hood I was like 6 years old watching him. All I can say is thank u for being part of my child hood
Would you say stampy is legendary
Sky is da best
He should do a part 2 with Aphmau, Stampycat, and PopularMMOs !!
Man I'm so glad Anthony is doing well.
Should've gotten stampy 😔
“Quantum super demons”
I love ALL these OG Minecrafters!! Lizzie was especially the person who inspired me as the Girl Boss she is!!!
Skydoesminecraft was my childhood together with yogscast
Sky made my childhood.. he gave me happiness 🥺
I love how all of my favorite YouTubers when I was 12 are here at once.
Why do you always come out of the roof lol 😂
These people were out Dream, Rambo, Tommyinnit. I was probably like ten when I found them, a little older? I’m so in shock
These were the people who built inspirational content, built the young YouTube gaming fan base alongside Markiplier, Pewdiepie and much more! It was so genuinely shocking the day sky left the internet, and Lizzie, him and Dan had that little Minecraft youtubers figurines I remember. It was incredible to watch the growth and I’m so grateful they were my icons
sky had so much impact on my humor and i definitely looked up to him in my childhood
WOW
Anthony is doing great, I love how he's looking to other people for a better prospective and he also provides that prospective to others, helping everyone including himself understand what others go through.
i love sky with my whole heart dude he was my childhood <3
I'm a simple person, I see LDShadowLady, I click. She's literally my fave YouTuber from my childhood <33
adam talks like hes trying to generate as many unusual sentences as possible in one video. love this man :)
I’m slightly surprised tobuscus wasn’t placed as an og minecraft YouTuber or any of team crafted other then sky but oh well
sit down with iaan pleeease do a old vlog just hangout itd make my whole year, life would be complete
Idk why but if I play minecraft for more than an hour , I get a vomiting sensation TT
the fact that og was when i first started watching when i was like 9
DanTDM was the goat when i wanted to watch minecraft!!!!
I like how Dan and Lizzie have these like emotional story times and feelings, then you got Adam like. “Fuck yeah I’m here fight demons”
The OGs: DanTDM StampyLongNose SkyDoesMinecraft CaptainSparklez Tobuscus Bajan Canadian Bashurverse Yogscast Maricraft Atlanticraft
Sky is my childhood first ever youtuber I watched made my day always and I still appreciate him to this day
God I love Adam bringing the energy
Bro sky was literally my child hood, i started watching him really young, i was disappointed when he stopped making minecraft but luckily i had other like max and ross
no stampy 😢
Arent u from smosh
Dan has gotten quite attractive
I love sky's confidence towards his music
Pewdipie is the og
niHachu AAAAAHHHHHH
Sky we all know it wasn't just because of your business
Albert
Sky was the biggest part of my childhood. I literally grew up on that channel (skydoesminecraft and skydoesthings) until he quit minecraft and a little after. I remember the try not to laugh, cops and robbers, hide n seek. All of it. He made me laugh and smile even if I had a bad day lol
adam performing exorcisms is the most adam thing i’ve ever heard of
I want Ihascupquake, popularmmos, and others next lol
Skydoesminecraft was someone I watched so much in middle school, right up til a year before I graduated high school. He had such a big impact on me, arguably my all time favorite youtubers of all time
C a p t i a n  S p a r k l e z  should’ve been here too
Darn you got the real og’s
Watching Anthony from smosh interview my other childhood content creators is probably one of the most meta interviews apart from him interviewing himself and maybe Ian
EVERY ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FOUND SOMETHING U WILL LIKE IF U LIKE LOKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS MAN HAS DONE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIMMMMMM. Sorry, this has nothing to do with this vid.
I can not believe post Malone lived with sky, I grew up watching him but I did not remember post Malone lmao
Thats strange. I type smosh and i see Anthony's channel. Does that mean smosh is promoting Anthony's channel now?
What about stampy lol
Do a video with smosh
¿where is vegetta777 and willyrex?
Popularmmos isn’t on here, imma bout to riot  In all seriousness great video
my childhood…..THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I CANT JUSTSHEVSNBS
What about I spent a day with residential school survivors or descendants of residential school survivors.
Can you do a part 2 with three different you tubers like stampy, ssundee, and popularmmos
Who still watches LDShadowlady<33  |
WAIT WHERE IS STAMPY CAT:( WHERE IS SQIASHY?!? WHERE IS LEE BEARRRRRR
if they’re still in contact, sky just needs to collab with post and get big in music because some of his stuff is good
Never thought Skydoesminecraft lived with post malone
damn sky is still funny?
It is crazy to see how much Dan has grown! I don't watch him much anymore but I loved his videos when I was a kid and I am really happy to see where he is now
if sky used to know post and is super confident about his music does that mean we might see a sky x post track? #
I love the intense editing specifically for Adam😂😂
Where popularmmos
are we going to talk about Lizzie’s curl at the bottom of her hair? 😍
I really wanna see a day with smosh
I never moved on from lizzies channel
I love OG Minecrafters  meeting new Minecrafters. Its the best thing
Sky is still so awesome to me fucking love that guy he is awesome
Wheres stampy and captain sparklez and popularmmos
Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooog
Kinda want a part to with this video, with aphmau, mithzan, yourpalross, or more of minecrafters
adam made my childhood so much happier and i appreciate him so much and i hope he can just continue contently with life despite everything he’s been through
I love SkyDoesMinecraft so much, when he finally started making music and got his son, I was so proud of him. Been a fan for the better part of a decade. 🔥
These OG Minecrafters are awesome. Literally my childhood, except Anthony. Anthony is a horrible person
Paulsoaresjr?
The memories are just flowing in. Happy to see Sky and Dan my childhood rolemoles!💕
I remember the first gaming video I ever watched was ZackScottGames. I used to love his PvZ content man
If you don’t know atleast 1 of these you never had a childhood
Yooo sky army!!
it kinda makes me sad, because lizzie used to be my entire world on youtube. but now im into the dsmp, and my interests have changed so much since i was little.
Sky is such a genuine loving dude. No wonder my childhood was so amazing ✨
I saw the vedio explaining what happened to team crafted band now I'm sad
Man, I can’t believe Anthony met the Ancient Ones
You got to spend the day with the people who raised me😭
I wish popularmmos was there
sky does Minecraft had a real tough life  glad to see him laughing again ❤️❤️❤️ other 2 hasn't changed a bit 😂
Where is yogscast and cap Sparklez?
The production quality on this is quite impressive indeed.
You should make a part 2 with thinknoodles stampy and popularmmos and if possible yogscast and captain sparkles
NAH CUZ IF YOU DONT GOT DAWN AND DEADLOX ITS NOT OG
I remember the pokemon series Dan did
Im a fan of ldshadowlady!
<3
Anthony acting as if he isn’t the actual OG in the room:
pov: u come back 2 yrs later after smosh ended and this pops up on ur recommedned
1:25 "a lot of characters" me and ogs: "TRAYARUS,BRANDON,GRIM,CRAIG
Adam never changed and I love it
Great video!!! Three OG Minecrafters with Three different personalities!
Anthony Padilla? More like Anthony tortilla
where stampy doe
Ok I break my computer because of Minecraft Minecraft is a minecraft what ever :(
Is it a sin that i've never watched skydoesminecraft
I MISSED THESE GUYSSSS!
Tell Sky to get his funny ass back on the Minecraft content because I loved growing up with him
It was so nice to see that just positive vibe and goddamn bopping energy literally radiate off Adam.  But still, its so weird to see these youtubers after so many years. It makes me feel old knowing that Dan has a kid.
Sky and Dawnables: my bisexual awakening
Surely do one with Technoblade
You should interview someone with mirror touch syndrome
Hey anthony if you can make a video *spending a day with holocaust survivors* that would be sick
DanTDM and Stampylonghead are my og Youtube heroes
my heros
Ian Herox Anthony Padilla
Where was Popularmmos in this :(
I totally forgot that LDShadowLady knew ZackScott
Adam will always be a near and dear YouTuber in my heart. I was so obsessed with his content and I purchased his merch and loved every video he produced. Of course I don’t watch him now but I will always give him so many thanks for all the amazing memories and him really sparking my interest in games. Seriously such an incredible creator that I don’t think I will ever be able to forget I mean wow. Brings me way back listening to him
The nostalgia of seeing Adam again
This is such a nice time travel into the past, I looked up to Lizzie so much and actually learned english with her videos (a fun little explaination for me having a british accent despite having american class) and just in general I am very thankful for the OG creators in particular the females for inspiring me and being role models
Oh.
do a video with george!
I was 9 and I got a DanTDM shirt and I was so happy
Anthony is hamker
God I fucking love how sky said “this is Albert”
You should do Lewis and Simon
Sky still talks the same and damn that hit ngl
u should def do og gamers who played just random games like they never stuck on one game and they got known as just a YouTuber.
Omg the nostalgia
sky has had such an impact on me. he was my childhood. i remember getting in trouble for watching him because of cursing lmao. i miss him and i want to support him when he posts music ❤️
This was so nostalgic and I still watch lizzie, I stopped for like 2 years and im back now and I'm so happy
I love how Lizzie is like "yeah I'm definitely past my peak" but her most viewed video is only from 5 months ago and has like 10 million more views than what used to be her most viewed 😂
Return to smosh. Plz I miss you in the videos. You two were the funniest people I've ever watched back in 2009. Would be nice if you would pop in a smosh video once in a while. Plz 😢😢
i’ve been watching ldshadowlady for years and i love how she’s herself
Is no one gonna talk about how BEAUTIFUL lizzies hair is?
one day there will be one of these with the dream smp ppl
What the heck is that game that pewdiepie play in this video if anyone know pls help
Mianite is still the greatest precursor of all the story-driven SMPs we see today.
<3 lizzie
Hey, Anthony I loved the video you made with those people who ran away from Amish communities. I suggest you to make a video with people who had almost-dead-experiences, it would be very interesting to watch.
Dan: Very nice and clean replies, good video quality and mic Lizzie: Very nice and clean replies, good video quality and mic Adam: YEAH MUSIC
HELP MY COMPUTER BROKE CUZ OF THE 4K QUALITY
You're missing stampy
these people raised me
SKY I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF I MISS YOUR CONTENT PLEASE TRY TO COME BACK
Itsfunneh next, please? Her first video was minecraft sooo 😀
makes me so happy to see sky again
Its been 5 years sense I last watched Skydoseminecraft and I still call gold butter
Pov you've been watching lizzie since 2013 and still love her channel
Okay, this is a throwback YouTube...
REVIVE ADAM CHANNEL
Sky was 100% a person who had a major impact on my life and introducing me into Minecraft.
Can you do one with young mothers?
I saw skydoesminecraft and I clicked Immediately 💪
seeing adam on here makes me super happy! i haven't seen him in so long
WHY WAS ADAM LIVING W POST MALINE WHAT
Your an OG YouTuber too
One question... Y no stampy???
Where xaptain sparkplez
dude can you plz do a part 2 with ssundee stampy and populermmos plz! they were my childhood :3
these three were my entire childhood, this is insanely cool <3
The fact that people refer to Lizzie as an og youtuber makes me so happy. Have been watching her videos since she first started and I am glad she is growing so much :)
Sky makes content on skydoeseverything tho
YES LIZZIE
Stampycat 😔
sky is still so fucking hilarious lmaoooo, hes one of the first gaming youtubers i ever even watched.i watched him literally til he quit so seeing him so happy and positive again warms my heart. im so glad hes doing well🥺💗
pls make your emo hairs again like in the good old smosh times
The only others I might have liked to see would have been thebajancanadian, and stampy
Bro Zach Scott is awesome
Whats the song that plays within the "more than bricks" part
10:17 Crazy Minecraft Bars
i cant believe i forgot about squid 🤣 i miss Adam but he seems so happy and that it brings me the most bittersweet sense of peace 😊 im so lucky to have had him through my teen years!
ian?
Stampy deserved a feature here.
Hey! Nice!
I was crying this whole video D:
TWO OF MY CHILDHOOD HEROES
Theres so many og minecraft youtubers😭
If I trick you.. Tell me >:3 ... Read more
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PEOPLE CALL COURGETTES ZUCHINNIS?!
Popularmmos should have been on this
I'm crying but I don't know why
damn wheres captainsparklez
albert
LIZZIE LIZZIE LIZZIE
No samgladiator?
Make a video with @stampylonghead please!
I just started watching Adam's old GTA vids with the gang. Scary coincidence but im glad to see that Adam is doing well :)
They are literally like the 3 legendary Sannin bruh
SKY YOUR BACK!
I FORGOT SKY EVEN EXISTED
Does anyone agree that Stampy or Squid should've been here??
God I miss old Minecraft, new Minecraft really fell apart, but could rebuild.
It was damn good to see Adam again!
you make great videos but stampy should be here i grew up watching him
Came for Albert stayed for everyone else
LDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADYLDSHADOWLADY okay i'm done.
Anthony: so I need a team LdShadowLady: you absolute baboon, this is a one woman job and if you cannot keep up then drown buddy. I'm a beast and you can't contain this. I eat raw eggs for breakfast and don't wash it down. I walk on the tops of trees barefoot like an oddly confused Jesus. you wish you were me.
Who else was CRYINGG through this entire video 🥺🥺🥺
"THIS IS ALBERT"
I've watched and heard of Dan tdm and skydoesminecraft but who the fuck is shadow lady?
Not me hoping for pat and Jen 😭
I wanna see him talk to the vannos crew
Lmao idk if anyone is gonna agree with me but I think there should be a video  of spending a day with Smosh members
Though I'm late to the party it was a breathe of fresh air to see these guys again.
I'd say Dan, Aphmau, Lachlan, Sky and Team Craft and Alantic Craft just made my childhood. Also thinknoodles but that was more for club penguin
12:39don’t forget vanoss 👏
are you from smosh where is ian now i watched you when i was 6 i loved smosh videos
my brother met sky years ago i think on mineplex it was right before he was going to record like a hot pepper minecraft challenge or something lol
seeing all these people makes me happy.
Could you do a video with MrBeast if you haven't already. Great video as always!
I still watch Lizzie and Dan and ill probably go back in time to watch their older content soon
Where’s stampy?
THIS WAS NEEEEDED👏🏼✨amazing
hearing how sky was depressed and drinking while i was watching him is like finding out your father was drinking when you were younger.
Yeh my childhood heroes
The big three minecraftians
i love sky and lizzie so much 😩
When Stampy isn’t in the vid😔
I only watched Dan and Lizzie as a child Sky seems soo cool i should've considered watching him when I was 6 or 7
“This is albert”
OMG ITS POST MALONE!
i really wish that popularmmos was in this vid and maybe crainer and ssundee
The reason why i watch lizzie back then until now is bc of her vibe
Sad to not see Pat and Jen here :(
maybe for a part 2, you can interview stampy, ihascupquake, ssundee, popularmmos, captainsparkles, and iballisticsquid!! i used to watch them a lot! it’d be great if you could interview them!
if i saw any of them in person ngl i would breakdown, cry, and ask for an autograph as if it were still 2015
It's amazing to see that these content creators after years and see how far they came on youtube with the help of creating Minecraft videos these content creators were not just only people recording a game they were also a big part of most of our childhoods.
Your a musician according to YouTube
Lizzie is one of my favorite YouTubers :D So is Joel! (For those who don’t know, Joel is lizzie’s husband and he has his own channel, smallishbeans)
Come back to smosh
Lizze: *Swears with a smile*  Me: Is that possible without being annoyed? When I started watching Youtube back at 2015 my brother made me watch DanTDM and thats when HE WAS ONE OF THE YOUTUBERS RAISING ME TO BE A GAMER-  Then I started watching other youtubers but always exit the ones who swear and suprisingly, DAN USED TO SWEAR- But now I love that damn Mexorcist- (talking about Eddie)
After them, came sundee and popularmmos
LMAO I can't imagine them swearing.
this whole video is giving me nostalgia, its not that long ago but still
I think Its best that SSundee isn't here currently
Spend a day with popular indie studio's or developers  (like team cherry, dani etc.)
Legends
I dont know if anyone remembers the SMOSH game that they made but it was fun
Wheres lizzys husband aka joel 🗿🗿🗿
A Legendary OG Minecrafters video with neither paulsoaresjr or EthosLab? Blasphemy!
without yogscast this video isn't as impactful, they are the reason minecraft is as popular as it is, along with skydoesminecraft. Simon and Lewis are the original minecraft storytellers, shadow of israphel is literally a classic, Jaffa cake factory, voltz, dirt factory and more. CaptainSparklez is the only other person who you can argue played in a part in the rise of minecraft, but yogscast is 100% the most quintessential OG minecraft channel.
Do The vanoss crew
Dude I’m still on that sky lived with post Malone
Hey Anthony, Just wondering if you could do "I spent a day with Native Americans". That would be amazing!
Who agrees that the old Minecraft YouTubers are better than the new ones
fuckin post malone??
this whole video brought back all my nostalgia as a child and i was very happy to see this
YO A VIDEO WITH JAIDEN
My OGs personally that I stuck with were Stampy, PopularMMOS, DanTDM, SkyDoesMinecraft. Not that I haven’t watched the others. Nice to see them all well. 😊
I will always remember these legends they made my childhood
Sky saying Dan is awesome is fucking awesome 👏
Aaww no stampy
MY CHILDHOOD OH MY GOSH THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY MY MINECRAFTER YOUTUBERS AND SMOSV
Who learned all their bad words from SkydoesMinecraft cuz I did 😁
I totally just punched a Child directly in the eyes
I am one of those people that watched Dan then fell off the game and now is back into it, since the past like few years, and absolutely love seeing his content again
I think I started watching lizzie around after crazy craft? I remember waiting for trollcraft episodes and I think she was one of the youtubers I kept watching as I'm growing up, and I remember watching her get engaged and married. it's been years and it feels like I just followed her yesterday? lmao this got way too deep
I made a video with their minecraft characters, I recreated them, or atleast tried to anyway in gacha club, with some other OGs aswell
i remember going to see dantdm on tour help
LIZZIEEEEEEEE
YOU TALKED TO LDSHADOWLADY YESSSSS
Bro Adam's just chillin 😂
SKYYYYYYYY
5:45
my whole childhood was in this video
LIZZIE!
If they were all to collab, it would be wholesome no doubt. <3
dan's decision to keep his kid's face private until he can decide is awesome. i'm always bothered by vlog channels that force their kids into vlogs before they get a chance to choose their presence on the internet
The fact that these people raised me
Anthony casualty dropping the highest quality content of its kind on Youtube - keep up the excellent work
"KNEE HA CHEW" BAHAHAHSAH I CANT
i spent a day with georgenotfound
I miss the old intro of dan and sky
I'm so glad to see Adam so happy. He was my entire childhood
DUDE I HAVE BEEN WANTING A JAIDEN ANIMATION ONE ON ONE FOREVER ! she’s literally the reason why I’m choosing my career :]]]
Adam was high asf during the interview lmaoo
These peeps were my frickin childhood dude like Lizzie and Dan literally raised me I sometimes go back to Lizzie cause she genuinely still makes good content same with dan
Y is sky doing music
lizzie looks so tired. i feel so bad. i’ve been here since the first survival series and she just looks like she’s aged so fast. i love her but i think she needs a break :((
Ight this nice but wheres stampy
It’s really nice to see Adam again. Glad he’s doing somewhat okay
Do a part two with SSundee, Popularmmos, and Stampy pls!
gosh, i miss sky. he taught me my first bad words lmao he will forever be a youtuber that will stick to me. absolute king
Lizzie!!!
i miss sky :(
I swear ZackScott is a legend in my books
sky’s comedy hasnt changed and i still absolutely love it. sometimes id spend nights just watching a ton of skydoesminecraft videos it was great
The fact you brought the OG of the OGs is very legend of you and thank you for that
i love lizzie so much i’ve been watching her since i was 10 and i’m 18 now been subbed ever since <3
hey i was wondering since you did a video with dream and other mcyts and talked about the dream smp if could try talking to the animator Sad-its
Ugh Sky is such mood. STOKED FOR THE MUSIC MY MAN 🥳
a little sad CaptainSparklez isnt in this video
love all the people in this video, no cap
So many flashbacks
You should have added stampy
so good to see that sky is still the same guy.. i miss him
i still watch ldshadowlady i lover her sm
When your favorite characters exist in the same universe
How Anthony somehow make his intros so deep
Could you do Spending a day with people with HIV please?
honestly you should really interview sky on his own, he’s a super interesting person
Yo adams cops and robber were my childhood
dan was and now once again is a comfort channel.. 😭
Omg these people literally raised me
Only here for lizzie
U should have also done popularmmos.
I love dantdm
I'm glad Adams doing better😁😁
me waiting for hermitcrafters like:
WHERE IS STAMPY, UNACCEPTABLE
Hey its post malone
where popularmmos
2014 best year
Please do a part 2 with iballisticsquid, Stampylonghead, and others
Remember technoblade and captainsparkelz
ALBERT!!!!!!!🤟🔥🥵
Sky does Minecraft was my childhood on YouTube

Adam is just so funny
It hit me differently when Dan said thanks to Dr Trayuraus
LOVE THE VID BUT WHAT AB STAMPY
aw sky
zach scott minecraft server was how found lizzie i remember even ninja himself was on zachs server
LETS FUCKING GO ALBERT
MUSIC BOYS LETS GO
i still love adam
Shout out to Albert
History shan’t be forgotten
Anthony and sky are prolly the biggest parts of my childhood on YouTube
THE GUY I WATCHED IN SKYS VIDEO WAS POST MALONE..... HOW THE FUCK DID I MISS THIS
guys these aren’t normal minecrafters they LEGENDARY MINECRAFTERS
Dude this just put a big smile on my face the whole time, I forget sometimes that I’ve known of Dan since 2014 and still to this day enjoy a DanTDM vid every now and then. I’ve also known of LDShadowLaday forever even if I’ve never watched her videos, and from this she just seems so sweet and awesome!! It makes me want to go check out her vids now <3
ALBERT
when u said non-binary ppl i was like .o. im non-binary!!!!
I would have died if Stampy was on here…
The faithful index relatively paint because colon intialy attack beneath a macho blood. weak, cloudy page
EEK WHOS EXCITED FOR THE JAIDEN ANIMATIONS VID
Aww Lizzie 💖
Yooo its the smosh guy
I miss smosh😢😢
Who like minecraf!!!!!
I spent a day with street musicians 🤔
I was only watched lizzie
Not so much LDShadowlady, but sky and Dantdm were my childhood, along with meatcraft, i forget the channel name but that was the series
I used to watch SkyDoesMinecraft all the time, it brought my sister and I closer together :)
I found a perfect “I spent a day with” video, you already did furries but you haven’t done “I spent a day with bronies” lol
I'm glad to see sky doing ok dude helped through a lot as a kid
Stampy, Squiddy and DanTDM, that was the ONLY people my boys watched for years! We love Dan!
The ogs are still my fav instead of the new prime minecrafters. Cause they are my whole childhood.
CaptainSparklez....
Bacon man
“Hello this is stampy and welcome to another minecraft lets play viseo!”
when dan's son gets older we must get a father and son minecraft video
Dan changed my life for the better. His videos were a escape for me. I also went to his tour which is cool
Omg Joel and Lizzie got marriedddd!! 😭😭 its been so long since I’ve watched her that’s so awesome 💞
The old school mod showcases were the shit
Dan tdm was my childhood, Ii mean 2012, all I would watch
sad that @ethoslab is not in this vid :(
Skydoesminecraft is MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD 😂
Can we get a part 2 with popularmmos, Stampy and Captain Sparkles
OOOOO
Pain no popularmmos
Adam is such a joke these days
YESSSSSSS
LES GOOO
Adam being sour for 10 minutes
I still remember being a 7 year old searching minecraft pokemon and saw pokemobs from Dan's channel
I wish ssundee was on this
Stampy hunger games was the best
anthony please come back in smosh
Something that really helped Dan, was branching out to things other than Minecraft
Shoulda had stampy bro
I see no MarieCraft
You forgot Etho
I think stampy would have been a great addition to this video
can you make a video with youtubers with “real world jobs” like dr mike and the lawyer guy thanks
im crying
What about popular mmos??🥺🥺🥺🥺
YES!!!
I still can't believe this guy once did epic food battles and song parodies for videos, what a blast from the past.. God those were the good old days weren't they boys?
shout out to albert
Also he's doing modern ones wooo!
Never forget the classics
I've always wanted to do a colab with dantdm but never had a chance to start YouTube
Lizzie will forever be iconic
It’s not complete without popularmmos
You should have gotten stampy and squid
Sky Look’s So Weird Now It Is Weird Hair And Wouldn’t Expect Him To Show Up In This Video After The Controversy But He Did And I Wanted To See What He Look’s Like Now He Look’s So Different With Long Hair
I'm disappointed theres no stampy
Lol thought he would talk more about his business when Anthony gave him the 5 seconds
Wow. I watched so many skydoesMinecraft  videos when I was so young.
Where is Captain Sparkly pants man
Could u interview the krew please!!!
God it hurts to see sky I miss his content so much
Venis
Lizzie ilysm <3
Its awesome that Post Malone is an OG in minecraft.
It’s great hearing Sky again
If Stampy’s not here then it won’t be complete
Bro skydoesminecraft was my childhood
Imagine if you spent a day with Smosh
I love Albert
Haha the bring me the horizon Chelsea smile clip at 16:03
You didnt invite Stumpy?! Smh...
TEAM CRAFTED
I still watch lizzie, I started watching her since when i was 6
When I was a kid I thought Dr Trayaurus was actually talking to Dan… just me?….. okay…..                   Have a Wonka Bar 🍫
So basically this video is about a Yt legend who interviews other Yt legends?
Is it sad that I never knew that smallish and ld are married…?
..........Mine,Mine,Minecraft..heh
I will never forget skydoesminecraft  He made my childhood the greatest time of my life
Fun fact guys dream is still punching the obsidian while technoblade is ringing the bell
Just to add on screen like "AAAHHHHHHHHH"
Dude Dantdm was my childhood LDshadowlady still love to watch her and sky does everything was one of my friends childhood honestly you guys kinda took part in who am right now and that's really amazing
Sky is just such a fun dude, he could literally upload anything and I’d watch it
Is this gonna be a whole series about spending time with legends or something
That BMTH reference killed me😂😂😂
My childhood heroes, I'd rather have them than the new ones right now.
I've been watching Dan since I was 11 and I'm going to be 19 tomorrow. I still love his content   I'm happy to see that Adam is doing okay right.
Miss Minecraft cops n robbers and the good ol Minecraft mod reviews from sky an Dan
we’re talking about legendary og minecrafters and stampy is not here
Do “I spent time with roblox YouTubers” next
i will always remember them forever til the day i die
WHAT ABOUT STAMPYLONGHEAD
Minecraft Pioneers will always have a special place in my heart
I'm personally still enjoying LDShadowlady content. She is still in her prime time for me personally.
Love to see Adam smiling again man😁
You did og's but you left out stampy smh..
Alright now we just need a team crafted reboot and 2021 is saved
These YouTubers were the golden age of MC YouTube  and now we have shit stains like dream and that Tommy guy
Nah they are just stight up heros
Popularmmos
this video is pure nostalgia right here.
I was 11/12 when I started watching Sky, im 20 now
I remember watching sky does Minecraft but I also remember watching Aphmau And that’s my childhood is her and LD shadow lady probably is the reason why I watch a lot of anime
Adam just be doin shrooms and makin music in his closet now lmaoo
Diamond dimensions was goated 🐐
Dan and Lizzie: Thank you so much for supporting me Sky: ALBERT
where is popularmmos
Where is stampy?!
SkyDoesMinecraft and Yogscast were my lifsource for a few years. Tbh, would be cool if you could interview Yogs at some point. 😅
This reminds me of the Scooby-Doo gang. Dan and Lizzie are Fred and Daphne but Sky is 1 part Shaggy 1 part Scooby.
Forgot populrmmos and stampy
NO ONE ELSE NOTICE THE BRING ME REF ??????¿???
Man, Skydoesminecraft was the shit! istg, i was such a big fan back then. Seeing him and others rn just makes My Little Dark Age play in my brain
been a bit, dan but gotta stop with giving me my cringy 10 yr old flashbacks
Kinda sad popularmmos ist here
Excuse Me: where’s the OG PopularMMO’s
SkyDoesMinecraft is an legend.
Here is a joke video for april fools or something: I spent a day with Smosh Thank you than you, i know how to be an unoriginal shitbag.
hey pt 2 with ssundee
Maaaan how I missed ZackScottland was such a great content back in the day.... I wonder how the rest of them are doing
"Adam's apple" does anyone remember that? 😈
Sky and LD were such idols for me and still are
I remember just going back from school getting to the family computer and watching ehats on it
Damn, dan reminded me that I’m not subscribed to you
what about stampy
PopularMMOs?
DanTDM is like my entire childhood. Love you man 🥲
Sky sounds like he’s on crack constantly
HAHAHA
Skydoesminecraft was the TITAN of minecraft
Heroes get remembered but legends never die...
literally my childhood youtubers
I love that even without that rambunctious personality he used to put on, Adam is still the same dude with that chaotic energy he's always had
15:37 doesn't have much to do with the video but i am dying of laughter
Crazy to see sky again since he was my whole childhood, good times 🥲
imagine stampy was here
You forgot stamps…
Childhood crossover
Popularmmos?
If only we had stampy here
PAUSE AT 4:52  YOUNG SSUNDEE  YOUNGDEE
love this vid
I feel like CaptainSparklez should have been here
I genuinely hope sky does overcome the shadow thats holding him back
They walked so we could run
DanTDM was my childhood. Enough said
Imagine if dans kid makes minecraft content how amazing would that be
Honey wheres stampy Lol
What you should have had interviewed was Aphmau. She created roleplay in Minecraft. She gave it life. And she deserves that credit .
Lol make a part 2 with creators like Stampy, popularMMOs, SSundee, and Cody from The Atlantic Craft...idk just saying
I still remember Sky from when he was doing Runescape Machinima videos before he even thought of minecraft.
Fun fact, ldshadowlady was the first person i ever subscribed to. I been watching her since her  “city of love” days.  Im an og shadowcadet
NOSTALGIA HOLY FUCK
What about popular MMOs
budder
7:33 Damn, if that were to happen to me, I would easily develop agoraphobia.
OG meets OG
This will forever be in my heart of my childhood YouTubers ❤️
I've watched jeromeasf/team crafted for nine years and this brings back so many memories
I hope Adams doing well he didn't deserve what that bitch Alisa did to him nor most of the stuff he's been through
When an OG meets an OG, one of the most ambitious crossover.
Hahaha
spend a day with tom hiddleston
This ages me extremely  *who’s with me*  🥲
Dude my faves were Lizzie, Dan, Amylee33, StacyPlays, iballisticsquid, Yammyxox, Stampycat, Joey Graceffa, and Ihascupquake… damn I wish we could go back to the golden ages of YouTube. All of these creators have a very very special place in my childhood
Where is stampylonghead?
Adam was my childhood he helped me thru the hardest times in my life and always managed to make me die of laughter I don’t remember a single video of his that didn’t make me laugh I wish him the best and thank you Adam for making my childhood a fucken great one 🥲
These guys are and always will be the foundation of Minecraft content!
4:15 thats one of my favorite videos of Sky, his hide and seek videos will always be one of my favorite series of his
The fact and Stampy isn't here should be a crime.
I hope sky is doing well
"ni ha chu"
I wish Stampy was here
next vid OG cod youtubers? faze rain, banks, nadeshot etc. (dont remember the other og's)
haven’t even watched it yet but IM READY  Seeing Adam talk is the funniest thing ever and just goes to show that Anthony doesn’t script this at all and only prepares questions. 10/10
yo where is stampy we all know he was the best
I love how Lizzie answered the questions like how she genuinely thought
A L B E R T
Why did u not talk to vickstar123
No stampy :,)
This gives me so much nostalgia-
Do spend a day with faze clean
Love the people on this vid, would love to see this with other og's like CaptainSparklez etc
What happen with papularmmos?
hearing sky's voice just makes me... tear up and smile
Thinking about childhood mcyts I remembered stampy the cat anyone else remember him
My childhood
Let’s gooo no dream here
Please make more of these with more og Minecraft you tubers!
12:17, Sky forgot to say calling Gold “Butter” lol
Sky was my childhood but before that, my first ever youtubers were fawdz and skitscape aka dan and tony I miss them
I wanna see flamingo in here
i fucking love adam's music go check that shit out
I’m glad Adam is well and not in pain. When all the drama started in his life I was young but still was worried for him. I miss his content but if he’s happy with what he’s doing I’m fine with it
They are better than dream.
the amount of clips I recognized leads me to believe i:  1) watch an unhealthy amount of Minecraft 2) had a good childhood
ÄŁbËrT
prime era
Johntron would be someone fun to interview, he may not be the most popular but he would be fun to see on your channel :D
nono Pewdiepie is the ONLY Minecraft youtuber, duh
I just realized that Anthony is just a therapist for other youtubers
Let us salute them for entertaining our now weird selves
Sky videos was my favorite as a child and grew up watching him.
Please come back to smosh
I'd like to see someone like  Stampy Popularmmos ItsFunneh   Next
I still remember sneaking the iPad into my room at night to watch SkyDoesMinecraft lets plays
LDSHADOWLADY RAISED ME.
Waves of nostalgia hit me harder than I was ready for
I wish I could talk to Dan, tell him how much he changed my life.
Sheeeeesh
Yo can u do stampy
make a video on spending a day with Smosh
Imo just turn everyone into vtubers and stream 😂. Everyone loves virtual anime streamers
imagine peeing next to dantdm
Anthony can you do a video spending a day with people who struggle with homicidal thoughts. I feel like they are so misunderstood and I want to learn more about it
Why isn’t CoryxKenshin not here 💀💀
You gotta do part 2 with pat and Jen stampy and captain sparklez
One day there's gonna be a lot of gaming grandparents youtube channels
When you realize Anthony is a OG himself
ADAMMMM 😭💛💛 God I missed him sm 😞💛 Thank you for bringing this series to life!!
I forgot about Zack Scott's, omg that was locked away in my memories
bru anthonys digital video production quality has gotten so mind blowing. Such a realised asethetic.
I grew up watching DanTDM. The Dr.Trayaurus videos were my favorite videos to watch along with markiplier and Pewdiepie. They made my childhood a little more bearable since my childhood sucked irl.
Didn't get Bajan Canadian unsubbing.
Go back to smosh pls
SKY jfc i miss him so much
the fact i still sing bacon man to this day is astounding to me
ALBERT
Sky is currently funnier than ever before. His music is solid and needs more appreciation.
I feel like if you exclude his contributions to both the Minecraft community and the YouTube community, Adam is a disgrace and a traitor. I get if he was burnt out, but that doesn't mean he had to spit in the face of a portion of his audience (if you don't remember that, you probably weren't a fan at that time). The same thing can be said about Ian/SSundee.
Can you do one with Stampy
SKY AND LIZZIE <33 I STILL WATCH BOTH OF THEM
I miss sky
They were our childhoods man
i saw dan tdm on his tour and ah man it was one of the best times of my life.
Dude, you’ve gotta do one with magicians! I want to know the truth 😂
Sky is forever my favorite youtuber
Where is popularMMos
GO FOR SAD-IST PLEASE!!!!!!
So how many times do you want to bleep out the many times Anthony says shit? Editor: 1
Need some Etho or Sethbling. Maybe some good old OldManWillakers. Not a big known name, but he created Dwarves vs Zombies (DvZ) which was such a great game/show!
Basically this whole video is:  “I haven’t heard that name in a long time.”
It's sad Stampy wasn't here
I remember back then when sky was very much terrified of squids and he used to call a gold bar "butter"
CaptainSparklez when
another video by anthony quesapadilla
wheres pat and jen???????
Dan has gotta give himself more credit he's really good
Plsss try to interview its funneh and the krew
What kinda music ya think adams cooking
I remember watching dans videos when I was like 8 really enjoyed them and spent almost all my free time doing that
It’s nice seeing sky smile again. Grew up with that man and hated seeing the shit he went through. It’s good to see a smile 😀
This was what I needed I watched all of these when I was younger along with Aphmau who else remembers All of her stuff
Miss the old YouTube
“So now you can go make me a sandwich!”-DanTDM lol
I've been watching dan for half my life being 14 years old
Does anyone remember stampy?
Ldshadowlady!!!!☺️
Wish some more of the legends were in here but its cool to see these guys again.
I’ll cherish these memories when I was younger.
surprised theres no antivenom or whatever his name was
LIZZZIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Sky and Lizzie were my entire childhood
DANTDM
I do miss the “old” them and content but at the same time I always get excited to see what they will do next and how they evolve. I always go back and watch older content of many because it allows me to go back to a time where I felt happy or sad, or a moment in life that’s was good or bad. It’s like a big time capsule that will be there forever. The only thing that scares me to death is the day they upload their last video
I'd love to see you talking with the Yogscast. I imagine you know how they are for back in the day but either way, they started off as WoW channel doing guild stuff and silly videos eventually, it evolved into minecraft, most notably the Shadow of Israphel series which I think most people back in the day when it was still going knew what SoI was if you bought it up. They are still going now and are now at this point a pretty decent sized youtube/streaming company and it would be pretty cool to get more of an insight into thier journey I think
Bruh are we going to talk about stampy the cat like that was the real childhood
where is bajan canadian
I agree that these are legendary minecrafters but you gotta do a part two with stampy, Iballisticsquid, and squashy.
This makes me wanna cry they made my childhood
You should spend a day with the Dream SMP
Sky and Dan (and Pat) shaped me into what i am today
I MISS SKY AND HIS HIDE AND SEEK VIDEOS
Everyone who likes this thinks that Anthony should interview Stampy because he was one of the biggest people in our childhoods
Do a part 2 with popularmmos
Loved this. It’s so cool to hear how things got done straight from some of the folks who did it best. This was great.
To be honest, if they dind't make youtube videos. Lots of our new youtubers would not have an inspiration to make videos :(((((((((
Somewhere in an alternate universe: spending an day with Anthony Padilla by DanTDM sponsored by the dark web
Dan will always be our youtuber father ✊
They should’ve done aphmau:’(
Want one of these with THE OGS, like Ethoslab and Antvenom
If yall remember the old lab with the golden laptop and grim all of that you deserve a veterans discount
Guys, Anthony Padilla will turn 34 years old in this year September, right?
My parents didn’t raise me. They did
Our childhood from legends in the making to veterans of YouTube
Come back to Smosh Ian needs help 😭😭😭😭😭
niHAchu
stampy should have been in here toooo
stampy and popularmmos should have been here
I need an Adam blooper reel from this video. Please and thank you. 😂
No ssundee? Dead vid
man this feels so nostalgic
Dan is literally the embodiment of my childhood
Nah that’s not my childhood mine was The Pack
omg you interviewed fricking onision
You know an OG Minecrafter I would've love to see here? PopularMMOs
Hey if you ever do a part 2 to old childhood YouTubers or just interview others, can you do stacyplays or ihascupquake?
I liked you better with smosh:(
should’ve added popularmmos 😤
We need offline tc
Crazy how i grew up with Adam man🥲
But where is Stampycat
I am kind of sad that it didn't bring up ssundee
Anthony Tortilla
YO ANTHONY consider doing a I spent a day with Native Americans.  Cause theres many variations of us and different tribes still.
The fact he got ldshadowlady in this video
JAIDEN ANIMATIONS
we need to get sky to 5 billion
"yeah, i got locked in a bathroom at minecon" made me laugh way harder than it should have
Ah! Lizzie is there :D
i am og but not a youtuber lol
I love how Adam was pre much memeing the whole time
what about popularmmos
I'd like to come to the show :)
I'm guessing Ollie Sykes is the secret guest.
Hearing Adam’s voice again is so surreal! Especially since you can tell he’s so much happier and open to joking around since his last Minecraft vids :) He was my childhood, and seeing him healthy and happy is so refreshing during these last garbage years
Idea I spent a day with LARPers
Uh if only stampy but their good to especially Dan and sky
Adam seems Either EXACTLY the same or high as a kite in this video. Or both 😂😂
God, I remember watching Sky's videos, the playbacks gave me some nostalgia. I haven't seen much of Sky's new content, but what I have seen is good, so I think keeping it up is a great plan!
still would like to see Anthony spending a day with Smosh members  edit: Oh
Why isn't SSundee in this like he is literally an IG minecrfater too
I read the title and thought he might have an actual og, like etho or doc
Dan my man
Stampy will not be forgotten
Remember smoosh
CaptinSparkelz is crying
Ldshadowlady is litterly my fav person in the world
Adam is a walking meme
Remember that time when Dan started playing different games like the amazing frog ... it made me a little bit sad, but now those vids are nostalgic as well
I think Adam might be my spirit Animal
where is stampy, anthony?
I remember skyy
i miss old sky but love his music, cant wait for more music
So much legends make me smile
This is *A L B E R T*
Holy shit I just realized that I've been watching both Dan's and Sky's videos for the last 10 years. There's so many good memories I have of back then when all I would watch was their videos and a couple other YouTubers and I would always wish for a collab between them two but I've only seen one time that they were both at a convention playing games together. I still want both of them to one day to just make a video together. Also I just remembered that Dan even built a statue for Adam in Minecraft when he was doing that series of all those YouTuber statues that he built in one world!
Me who still constantly watches LDShadowLady And DanTDM:  WOOHOO IM STILL A KID BABY
*llora de emoción*
sky was my wholee childhood. I learned English by watching him so much as a child
... Smosh interviews
You forgot stampy 😞
tf is LDShadowLady
lizzie and sky raised me honestly. aphmau as well! but i still adore shadow craft and rewatch from time to time
I don’t want to cry but I should thank you Anthony
Wish thebajancanadian or ASFjarome were on here
Stampy? :((
LDSHADOWLADY
Popularmmos we need him here
This is big w
i thought jaiden animations said she didn’t want her face shown. have i missed something?
dan and lizzie are literally my childhood
going to go watch deadlox and sky’s spring break parkour map now :’)
I never watched any of these 3
Sky did Minecraft
I love this whole video
I was really hoping for bajan canadian
Dan: Calmly talking about Minecraft career Lizzie: Calmly talking about Minecraft career Adam: YEAH MUSIC. QUANTUM SUPER DEMONS. ALBERT.  But actually, it made me smile a whole lot seeing Adam again. This legend still makes me laugh as hard as I did the day I started watching him.
Imagine not Stampy and popularmmos
I'm kinda sad stampy isn't here
SKYYY
i remember when skydoesminecraft slid into my friends dm's in english class in 11th grade lol
i’m sorry but where is stampy
you should do one with popularmmos, jen, and stampy
It’s not like your an og yter
You should interview captain sparkles
LOVE all of these people! Great vid <3
That Minecraft Golden Era is GOLDEN ... It saved my 8th grade with my friends  I really Like the Team craft and their MC story Series
i would of love to see tobuscus here
Okay, SkyDoesMinecraft was so good, I still go back to his older videos that were my childhood today
This made me so happy to see
Tell me no one else was expecting Popularmmos, he practically raised a whole generation
So happy to see Adam :D
Me:*mining youtuber ore* the ore:you gave Anthony Padilla ldshadow lady dantdm and skydoesminecraft
Hey it pose mellon
Wheres stampy?
If you ever do a part 2 with more OG MCYTs, here are 2 people you could do SSundee CaptainSparklez (Who is still relevant today)
all i did when i was in elementary school was watch skydoesminecraft
This makes me want to rewatch some of their vids. I miss watching their videos after I got home from school.
How many times did you have to fix your roof this month?
*Dream enters the chat*
DanTDM: one of the best experiences has to be meeting so many fans around the world LDshadowlady: one of the best experiences has to be me having the opportunity to voice a game character SkyDoesMinecraft: LETS GOOO A LAMBORGHINI
The death of MCSG was real.
Like with dream can you do technoblade!
Wheres Stampy Man!
Skitscape and Fawdz did it first 🤷‍♂️
Adam still has his Adam humor and personality
I'm watching dan since I was born and I never said to myself that I'm to old for his content because i realise that i grow with him and it doesn't matter how old am I'm still watching dan till he quit YouTube and said to us is our turn to make videos
IVE BEEN WATCHING DANTDM SINCE I STARTED WATCHING YOUTUBE SO WHILE THEN I STOPPEED FOR LIKE A COUPLE OF YEARS CAUSE YANO LIFE BUT OMG THE AMOUNT OF NOSTALGIA
Smosh, skydoesminecraft, Markiplier... Oh my gosh the memories.
Skydoesminecraft really made my childhood a memorable one
i honestly wish captainsparkles was a part of this too
My inner kid is so happy to see Adam, Lady, and Dan again😭😭😭
Glad to see Anthony doing well ever since he left Smosh
Dan is way to wholesome
i’m literally still subscribed to dan and i watched his videos RELIGIOUSLY for a couple years and then i found a ton of other youtubers like captainsparkles and others. it’s so cool to see how much he’s grown as a person and a creator
one chat caught me off guard   "He's still alive?"
DanTDM was young me’s life
Why don't anyone ever remember Mitch and Jerome
Stampy should of been in this video....
squid is just the bomb
Video Idea: I spent a day with the FGEETV Familly. They were my childhood
Honestly the effort =/= views things is so relatable as somebody who puts all my effort into meme videos and gets 20 views while a 10 second video gets 20 thousand
In reality sky has a dark past with minecraft and his life
Butter squid?
You missed stampylonghead
net is sooo annoying
I do wish you could’ve got SSundee
The TDM ones were nostalgic af
I like how Adam was just memes the the whole time. Just unfiltered raw memes.
do it with technoblade
ZackScott Games still an og
o7 Shadow Cadet from 2016
I guess new generations of fans come as old ones grow up and move on
Sky will always be the best and my most favorite youtube.
Sky has a massive ego omg
Man i miss sky
i think that net net no body shoud start a podcast that wound be so fun
Wonder if Ssundee would do an interview.
my first name on minecraft was SkyTheGirlRS.
:0 u were on smosh right?!
Lol i remember getting recommended videos of DanTDM, Skydoesminecraft and Smosh altogether on the main/home page whenever i visit youtube back in 2013.
Only if PopularMmos was here :(
so crazy lol,  I used to watch sky from his runescape videos,  didnt even realize he got THAT popular with minecraft until now holy
Alt title: All the guys who made our childhood in one video.
LIZZIE MY QUEEN
this is what you called legends and not a green guy and bunch of british
Getting the Sidemen on this would be a shout tbf
Didn’t Sky beef with KSI😂 When was that again?
Lmfao I love how Adam is still crazy even now, He's hardly changed since the "old days".
Its sad that sky does everything does not do anything.  I use to watch him alot in late 2013
Is it bad that I don’t know who sky is? I watched a shit ton of LDShadowlady and DanTDM when I was younger, but I don’t know who tf sky is. Please don’t raid me
Spend a day with people who have dementia
dream sadly better
I missed the content from the Minecraft YouTubers I watched but I grew up from others. I think YouTube helps kids learns of what it means to grow up and how it affects by connecting relationships like this.
When I was in 2nd grade my sister told people that skydoesmincraft was our cousin and people believed it for some reason
Pat and Jen
Ah yes, the good ones.
I like how Dan and Lizzy are calmly talking about their time as minecraft youtubers, touring the world and being on Minecraft Story Mode, and Adam is over here like I BOUGHT A LAMBO BECAUSE FUCK YOU and SUBTITLES GO AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I said to my friend “are you a padildo” he had the most confused face it was halarious
When i was a kid,i was watching Dantdm and i didn't know that a villager can talk in mc then i realize it was just an edit now..
Why isnt popularmmos here 🤨⁉️
omg I’ve been waiting for this lmao
You should do a video with TheGamingLemon
from day one up until now, sky will always be a chaotic being
Yep Sky just hasn't changed one bit just as I remember him. I hope he has the best luck with his Quantum Super Demons and Music
Where’s stampy at? 🤨📸
Should’ve had stampy
Adam and Dan were the very people who got me into minecraft, I was browsing YouTube one day and found their videos and my god am I happy I did, they are my minecraft childhood, man do I miss those days.
I FEEL SO FUCKING OLD AHHHHHHH
You should have done sundee and popularmmos too
Popular MMO tho
Im so glad that you made this Vid. Sky, Dan, LD. We’re my child hood . And some more Minecraft you tubers like stampy Unspeakable , moose, and others. And  some others . And I hope they have a great future . God bless everyone .
NON BINARY PPL! MY PPL!
Man forgot stampylongnose smh
Anthoney the week after next week: I Spent a day with Elon musk and Bill Gates
adam!
The fact that Ihascupquake is not on here is so offensive. She is a legend among the minecraft community. She is...... THE CHOSEN ONE!
Stampy thoooooo
Popularmmos next
why arent there subtitles? ;-; it made this very hard to follow because of the camera constantly switching, the conversation is missing a lot without subtitles, for me anyways.
Idea you could do markiplier
Wish Stampy or popularMMOs could join you!
what if when dans son got older he start playing minecraft on dans channel also I loved this vid
Still waiting for i spent a day with Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox
Albert.
Maneee I used to love Dan's creepy pastas, back then he used to curse like a sailor and it was the funniest he's ever been. Stupid YT algorithm made him soft but still I grew up with him.
The real hero here is stampy.
skydoesminecraft changed my life, i love him and i hope he is happier in the future because he has had some hard times
My Childhood got me so hard in this video.
man i missed sky, i wish he did something with doo or fitz
queen lizie i still watch her <3
hell yeah
Holy shit when I saw ur face it was oddly familiar until u show the Smosh channel holy shit it's been a while man
It's been 7 years.
Lizzie literally raised me and I still watch her videos till this day for like 8 years
I think we all had a flashback to our childhood for me it was Dan hbu guys?
YES
Yeess Anthony I've been waiting for this for a long time now one of my favorite youtubers spoke to a really OG youtuber
No one remembers that 3rd name
The only good Minecraft YouTubers. There, I said it! But it's the truth
Damn i relived my childhood
A childhood so golden, I never regret I was part of.
E p i c
w- wheres popularmmos?
This is great, but I have to say, it would've been greater with Stampy
I recently learned that skydoesminecraft and post malone were friends and played together, and now he startin to look like him too
Where’s stampy
I need this video: I spent a day with famous Hermits from Hermitcraft (GoodTimesWithScar, Mumbo Jumbo, Grian, Zombie Cleo)
I miss sky I hope he’s doing well
Dan literally carried my childhood and i still watch him often, its like he grew up with us. Also can i just say hes such a good dad keeping his childs identity secret until he can decide himself, massive respect to dan
Please Dan and Lizzie were my favorite I actually still watch Lizzie 💕
Finally Legendary Minecraft Youtuber Return
LLooking at sky now is like taking a peek at my childhood... Amazing
Do anyone remember  Kingdaddydmac  Minecraft video?
Next time you go oh mcyts please do the yogscast
Those people suck
Skydoesminecraft  Was my hero back then What happend to me
I would watch dans Minecraft story videos with all his collections, and I watched all his happy wheels videos oh my goodness what a blast from the past
The world used to so much simpler. I’d go to school do that and come home to a new skydoesminecraft video and that was it. Everything was great and fun, now I’m a 21 year old dealing with a bunch of shit and everything sucks
Man this brings banck memories
u didnt invite stampy? :(
Dude Sky made my whole child hood and I loved him and I still do I'm glad he's doing better now and everything. :)
Ahh i miss the old minecraft youtubers
This makes me happy hearing sky talk again
Ita unfortunate these guys grinded so hard meanwhile all the new Minecrafters got to make an appealing title plus a staged video. And they get instant praise. Hell, they could BREATHE on a shitty app like Twitter and get more praise then these guys ever imagined
Most of my childhood in a video
It's always great to see Adam doing great.
bring back dr. trayaurus...
YES DANTDM I LOVE HIM YES YES YES YES AND LDSHADOWLADY FINALLY THIS IS THE MCYT IM TALKING ABOUT
How about famous groups like dream smp, vanoss crew and stuff
These minecraft legends raised an entire generation of children, but where's stampy?
I'm very, very new to minecraft and I have watched every single one of Lizzie's videos she's ever made in the last few months. Her content is amazing, it's always fun. She works so hard! and I'm so excited you made this video and included her :D
Hey Anthony please could you interview OKMultiplay even though they only have 40k I think they could need the shoutout because they are so funny and deserve more and I think you could get a good video out of it because you could interview them on why their channel flopped and if they would continue YouTube. This is only a suggestion but it would be amazing if you could, love the content though man.
You should interview rdc there having a great year
I would watch DanTDM almost every day as a kid and now I do the same with Minecraft youtubers like Dream and Tommyinnit, and I just find that so crazy haha
He forgot stampy
Its just sad popular mmos has fallen
if anthony does this again, can he do stampy? he was my childhood!
If you’re watching this video, these people either partially raised you or inspired you to continue your life. They didn’t ask their fans to attack or cancel anyone. It was always a good ass time. Then we all grew up.
Tbis guys and girl made my whole childhood
I used to watch skydoesminecraft everyday years ago. One time i got failling grades and my phone was taken away, when i got it back i used a whole week to watch all his video.
DanTDM literally raised me as a child
Mad that pewds isn’t here
Anthony is just upset he increases in cringe no matter what he does...
Stampylonghead created my childhood idk about you guys stampy is a legend
Even if Sky is not as relevant, He made such an impact that i’d literally start crying if i see him cuz he was LITERALLY my childhood
Dan was literally my whole childhood
Roblox next
Deym i do misses tiny Turtle and little lizard and little kelly content in minecraft :(   Edit: ik that the 3 of them are making vids like as in 2021, but the nostalgic in rp in city, school, tour.... Is just "i do want a pc and dl some mods in it" when i watching them playing the roleplaying....
But captainspaklez :(
These 3 and others like stampy, etc shaped me as a person, I kept following some, forgot some, hated some but the amazing memories & experiences I had stayed with me & shaped my personality like my humour(which is fucked). Love you guys!
WHERE IS CAPTAINSPARKLEZ??
Who knows scot from blitzwinger
New Minecraft ytbers suck sky was my fav
I can proudly say I watched sky since the beginning and I was so sad when he left and I now still support his new content. I refuse to forget him ♥️He was and still is my idol🙂
Still remember when I pretend like Im DanTDM when I was a kid
Dad?
Honestly, popularmmos deserves to be here but i think there is some issues with jen and pat divorcing and stuff
7 billion people 21.5 billion views damn
im glad I grew up with diamond minecarts, not man hunts
Dantdm and Anthony padilla  Two legends who made my childhood in the same video 🤯  5 year old me would call me crazy if someone told him this would happen in the future 😂
Dude this hit me hard. I remembered the good old cops and robbers videos that Sky made before.
Add dantdm to the dream smp!
I miss Skydoesminecraft and his minecraft vids, he was my comfort YouTuber. But I'm happy that he's finally doing something he wanted to do.
OMG
I’m not crying while remembering the good times, you are 💔
What about Aphmau????
I remember being really into Minecraft role plays so I would watch youtubers like Aphmau, ItsFunneh, etc. I discovered Sky when he did that Minecraft walking dead series and maze runner and became of fan of him and so many others. I rmb Dan also small roleplays like with Dr Tryansouraus (how tf do you spell it lmao) I eventually grew out of this phase but with the rise of the Dream SMP roleplaying, it brought back nostalgia and makes me want to rewatch old series I loved so much.
How this dude got 101,000 like and only 344 DISLIKES?! shows his content is great
Just remember that they are also appears in Minecraft story mode
Man I love Adam, instead of shouting out his music, he decides to shout out his dog
Anthony was doing better content in smosh
Ya know, I commented on another video explaining how the dsmp wasnt the only mcyts and honestly thank you so much for doing this interview.
Oof Stampy
Skydoesminecraft its been a long time since i have heard that name wonder if Aphmau will be here too hopefully chrisandthemike poppularmmos and carflo but thats just a dream  Edit: Reality is Often Disappointing but the world must move on as you cant escape the inevitable my disappointment is immeasurable but my day is not ruined
I love ldshadowlady so much. Im definitely an overly sensitive person anyways but hearing her talk makes me choke up a little bit. I grew up watching her videos and being so inspired by her I even tried to create my own mods because of shadowcraft. I am eternally grateful to have grown up during that era of YouTube.
Why is Lizzie so cute and perfect? GOALS <3
Man i liked antony more better when he was in smosh but well things change
i love sky man, best memories, used to watch him play with deadlokes and stuff haha, built my childhood, reason why my parents used to get mad at me for getting ready late for school in grade 4 watching this now when im graduating soon is crazy
Reject modernity *EMBRACE TRADITION*
It’s not og if stampy wasn’t in this
This guy just made a video about Minecraft YouTubers without featuring Stampy...
I literally watch every Minecraft YouTubers
I will forever day budder <3
The only ones missing, for me at least, are Lewis and Simon, Captainsparklez, and Stampy.
Jeez the nostalgia...
WHERE'S STAMPY?? PAT (PopularMMOS)?
I LOVE THOSE THREE SO MUCH! I honestly felt like crying when I watched this, they taught me a lot of things and helped raised me to who I am now 😭
Ssundee not here 😭
This might as well be my favourite video on the entire platform
guys dont worry lizzie still swears lol 💗💓💕
Bodil40 🤘
i was watching my first video from sky when my mom told me to come in to the living room and mom and dad told me they were getting a divorce. so, uh, saying sky helped me through the bad times is an understatement.
Imagine if you got  Squid and Stampy
I love adam so much. Ive stuck with him for so long. I love his music too
I still watched Dan's videos since 2015 till now, because he's the one who makes my childhood happier.
imagine dan and sky doing a collab and making a song together. ultimate duo.
It's sad how I used to binge watch their videos but nowadays I just get bored of watching them. I still love them though, they literally MADE my childhood and I remember having so much fun just watching their videos :)
they made me, me
Anyone else really miss Sky’s prison escape Minecraft videos??
These Youtubers made me play Minecraft, I had no idea what it was without them.
Yeah music  -Adam
Dan was so good, to bad he fell into a hole of follow every trend imaginable
Man i thought captainsparklez would be in this
Sky capping, he does do Mc videos- I think he uploaded two weeks ago on sky does everything. Also I love the video! I just wish Tobuscus would have appeared. I see a lot of people having like connections to these ppls but my childhood was Dan, Tobuscus and popularmmos. Still amazing to hear from all these awesome content creators! Also you had Dan so that’s a huge plus
These mc youtubers>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> dream smp youtubers🤮
“I was living with the rest of Team Crafted and Post Malone” cracked me up. An unlikely sentence for sure, lol
SKY was the best part of this
I remember when I posted a comment on one of dans videos to play turbo dismount, then like one or two videos later he played it, good times
calling minecrafters gangsters is an understatement
Imagine if he Adam just embraced the name everyone know him for as his music name🤯 skydoesminecraft? Who is that? Oh just some dude who made millions off of playing a popular videogame and now makes music. SAVAGE
Didnt even have stampy
Yeess CHILDHOOD and i love his long hair now , ive been recently watching his Gta videos and try not to laugh videos
Ayo Smosh AND the og MC players?  Childhood time!
interview the smosh cast     were all very eager to see it
This brings me a smile to my face Man year's have been passing way to fast
I wonder what Sky is on
I'd love to see you interview the Yogscast! That would be awesome
Dude, you forgot about one OG Minecrafter: StampyLongHead.
I’m glad this video was made, it makes me happy; or should I say US happy to hear from these guys
I remember that runescape sky vid   Sky vs bear it was great
Seeing lizzie afters month after getting into dream smp I forgot about all these ogs god dang I remember when I always used to watch lizzie
She mention my boy zackscott, i love that man
Don’t forget the other ogs Ssundee and mr crainer
Sky does Minecraft is the go of all and I’m happy he has found something that he loves and also Lizzie ♥️♥️
Wheres popularmmos?
:O
11 Million of Sky Does Everything but the OG SkyDoesMinecraft had 24 Million. That guy is a legend... Scratch that they all are.
Sad that popularmmos is not there but either way its good
Lizzie: shout out to these wonderful channels Dan: thank you all! Sky: A L B E R T
Dude its so weird talking to a green screen mirror
11:21  in the video the memories came back LDShadowLady DanTDM Stampy Cat CaptainSparklez the mash-up of the century in Minecraft story mode absolute Chad existence and I'm happy I'm alive
I went to dans world tour💝
I am sorry but where is stamp stampy
i remember watching SkyDoesMinecraft
bruh why didnt you ask me
Stampylonghead
LIZZIE👹
night night
stampy?
5 seconds to shout out anything you want  *T h i s  i s  A l b e r t*
Where Philza
Dantdm was my hero for so many years, dude was an inspiration to me and I’m happy to see he’s doing good
I watched Sky Sooooooooooo much as a kid that I can't even rewatch his old videos anymore without having very vivid flashbacks because I start crying
The whole time i thought sky was on drugs
Adam is still just as funny and I love it
Damn man. I remember watching Dantdm Pokémon Minecraft. And skys show
Pssssh, these weren't OG. Yogs were OG.
Skydoesminecraft man this guy is the reason my childhood was fun af
i started watching Lizzie when I was so young, and I have enjoyed her content since then. I won’t stop watching her and Smallishbeand until they decide to stop lol 💗
Wait adam lived with post ma? HOLY CRAP
Adam: albert
Sky is the most og here we can all agree
bring bashurverse into the vid, there's alot more topics to talk about
Pat and Jen anyone..? No? Just me? Okay... nevermind..
shouldve gotten stampy and iballisticsquid too
Ahhhhhhhh, my childhood feels so good, I miss it.
I know these are Og minecrafters but I wish they added stampylonghead
I really want to meet sky. He’s an idol and I’ve looked up to him sense I was a wee lad. I’ve wanted to for a decade now and he pushes me to be the best version of me I can. Some day, man. Some day.
I'm a little sad that Aphmau or PopularMMO's weren''t included as one of the OG Minecrafter's, especially since they're both STILL uploading videos today, but being able to see SkyDoesMinecraft in the modern day again certainly makes up for it!
I miss watching them a lot, even people like stampy, but its like loving pbs kids as a child as you get older you can still appreciate all the memories and everything its taught you. its just not the same when youre an adult because youve grown out of it.
Sky has a special place in my heart
stampy should be in this
Well let's be honest here....you forgot stampy
Budder
BUTTERMAN SKYDOESMINECRAFT
I kinda miss Mumbo Jumbo in this list, his first vid was 9 years ago and he started playing on the popular server Hermitcraft in season 2.
Holy crap Adams got some hair
Og Minecraft Youtubers are the pillars of our Childhood and the Minecraft community.
4:00 sad
You know what would be cool? If you got the fortnite creators on. I don't like fortnite my self but that game was once the most popular and is still pretty popular
I miss stampy
Can you interview michael reeves?
Spend a day with technoblade pls like so they can see.
I love how dan and Lizzie are giving really personal and thought provoking answers. And Adams just like “yeah I bought a lambo. That was pretty sick”
This is my childhood in one video lol
Ahh yes sky, dan, and shadow, my childhood YouTubers
The fact that sky can still be happy with himself and what he’s doing after all the stuff he’s been through is crazy. He literally constructed my childhood without knowing it.
Fuck man.... god. Mr beast save them please, you say your collabing with the best minecraft youtubers. I don’t see any of these names on here. Lizzie I never watched but I know her, she even would be better. (I don’t care cancel me dream stans idc)
He needed to add captain sparkles in here
its super nice to see that sky is happy now i remember everything that happened with him, he still makes me laugh to this day.
Ok where’s toby games?
Nothin makes me happier than seeing sky/adam back on the Internet
The two things I remember from SkyDoesMinecraft are Butter and his mod showcases.
Man I love Sky. Shame that he had the fall he did
No Stampy?
SkyTDM really shaped me to who I am today and I can see myself in how he really behaves up until now lol.
Adam was the original crackhead energy and you can tell he is a crack head god
I STARTED SCREAMING WHEN I SAW LIZZIE OMG
I still brag to my friends about being an og subscriber to pokedan and his new channel
Oi
Now we wait for, 4 more (Stampy, Mmoss etc(
I still watch dan
Damn last i heard about sky was about his kid god he looks better? For the most part
Man, YouTube in the 2010s (mid 2000s) was the best of YouTube, now we have this hogwash of a platform.
I watched popularmmos
it’s so sad that time just passes off like thos
Love Albert
Interview PopularMMOs!!!
THE LEGENDS WILL BE REMEMBERED
Ive been watching minecraft since I was so young- its so weird to see that the creators I watched at like 9 are still out there, now that I'm 16. Like I still watch mcyt. This has been my special intrest in the background of my life, for 9 years.
Ld shadowlady is so cute
I LOVE LIZZIE SO FREAKING MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dream can never compare to these OG's.
Where is Stampy?
lizzie still makes me laugh and smile even when she's not recording lol and the other og minecraft channels in this video.
i still have merchandise from when dantdm came to sydney :D
We all know Pewdiepie is the real minecraft og
I totally forgot that skydoesminecraft literally lived with post malone back then
Not to be one of those “WhO rEmEmBeRs SkY iN 2021” dudes, but seriously, where the hell my fellow Sky Army vets at?
Alt title: legends of the early 2010s (Anthony and the mincrafters) in one video
The minecrafters that made our years. Wish we can go back to those years to witness our enjoyment all over again. How times have changed. Now we have these minors who have beyond psychopathic fans who actually commit actual crimes. Ngl im kinda disappointed that stampylongnose or captainsparkles didn’t participate in this. Also i think Sky should’ve stuck with Minecraft, i don’t think his music is doing well.
My childhood was at their hands
Awesome video man. Maybe you should do like big like 2012- whatever content creators next, like  Toby games,etc…
My (rather toxic) ex friend introduced me to Lizzie's videos back when she was still uploading the crazycraft series- And even though we've parted ways, I still watch her videos and it always brings a smile to my face. No one really ever thinks about the challenges that youtubers face, with the pressure, hate, and viewers asking for new content seconds after a video comes out- so it's always good to remember that they aren't just code in youtube, too- they have lives just like you.
If only there was a time machine
lizzie shouting out joel and shadow cadets <3
Sub deserved, great vid man
LIZZIE
Sky is just as crazy as I remember!
I wish basher (now toasty) was able to be interviewed
ZACKSCOTT IS THE REASON SHADOW LADY IS POPULAR ????!! BROO
I remember sitting in my basement nine years ago watching DanTDM's Christmas countdown.
I think Anthony should interview edgy youtubers like FilthyFrank,Keemstar,Idubbbz,Leafy......in the next video
CaptainSparkles or BajanCanadian would've been better than LDShadowlady (no offense).
Out of the three, I’ve only watched DanTDM (a lot!!! Lot lot!! Especially in the past!! 2014 - 2020 I watched DanTDM a lot) and a little bit of LD Shadow Lady, and the comments about Sky makes me feel like I missed something important.
Tysm for this video
Wish PopularMMOs was here
U should do a day with femboys if u can :P
*Sad Yogcast Fan Noises*
Anyone know the name of the tune that starts at 8:40? It reminds me of Mass effect, I Iove it.
Shadow lady and Dan: calmly talks about Minecraft   Sky: MUSIC IS COMING
i still watch lizzie <3
“Shoutout to my husband and fans!” “Shoutout to the character that played a vital role in my success!” “dög”
For next April fools do “I interview completely average people” and then have them doing crazy shit while you interview them
ive been subed for 2 years it would be nice if i got a shoutout! :D
I’m surprised he didn’t ask Stampy to be in this video
As a female player, I was raised by ldshadowlady, ihascupquake, and Stacy plays! In elementary and early middle school I felt I didn’t fit it with girls my age so I would try to hang out with boys but they didn’t want to hang out with me so I often was left alone in the corner watching these amazing female gamers do what they loved, it reminded me I only need me, myself, and I and I should be good, I later got back into the game last year because my little cousin loved it, and I finally had another person to play with! And having autism Minecraft would help me create things I couldn’t put into words
Sky literally helped me through the toughest shit as a kid.
SKY the Beautifully Bombastic Butter Boy. The army I never quitted. RISE FELLOW BUTTER WAR VETERANS, SALUTE TO OUR GENERAL TO PAY RESPECT *cries*  Is it wrong to feel betrayed?
I haven't watch for 4 years. Is this the smosh guy?
My childhood was dantdm and ldshadowlady. Still watch lizzie and sometimes dantdm.
No one cares about your dream vid💀😭
he said it.. he said SMOSH im crying now
Legendary OG Minecraft era without PewDiePie isn’t a thing.
I miss sky's old videos
The day spent with Ian / old Smosh crew will be amazing
Me: doesn’t see stampy *sheds a tier*
Congrats Lizzie We are so proud of you
Dan: “You know keeping up with YouTube is definitely something that’s a challenge” LDShadowLady: “I’m a very healthy person, I don’t care about when my peak is” Adam: “yeahhh Music go BBbbRrr” 😂
I literally cried while listening to Lizzie :') I've never followed a female content creator like her for so long and it's like she raised me to be who I am now! Some people truly don't understand how much of an impact these creators make on their audience and I'm so grateful to have grown up in the hands of these amazing people <3
PopularMMOS, Stampy, TBNRFrags, iBallisticSquid next i hope
Dantdm was such a master story player
All my nastalga is 22:17 minutes
ive been watching lizzie for 8 years straight
0:30 oh no. the vexes
I miss them TvT. I miss them so much TvT
Everyone forgot GoodTimesWithScar, one of the greatest OG Minecraft survival builder Minecraft may ever have
they helped me threw my childhood and i missed them when they stopped posting MC vids
Yeah music
anthony: "you need at team nowadays" technoblade has been forgotten
A collab we needed so many years ago Legendary Og youtubers meeting each other
LDShadowlady, the loml 😭
Yes
I’ve been watching Lizzie since I was 9 and I still watch every single video she puts out
I want to preface this by saying I'm very grateful for Adam for giving many of us a fun childhood/teenage years. I can definitely look back fondly on so much of my time watching youtube and know that his videos were there. But geez, some people can't understand that it's in the past. So many people who worked with Adam make content of their own, but get reminded constantly of their lives when working with Adam. I don't doubt that they're thankful to some extent for what Adam did for them, but that's in the past. It sucks when you enjoy the content they make now and someone says, "I miss who you used to be." Like, that's messed up. Nostalgia is a great feeling, but when you bring up bad memories of times that they grew out of, it's a really shitty feeling. Like I said, I'm grateful for the time when Adam was SkyDoesMinecraft, but god people, some of y'all have to grow up
Lizzie literally raised me. She was my role model <3
I’m glad LDShadowLady mentioned Zackscott. I feel like he’s the most underrated YouTuber ever.
day 3 7.1k comments
A s q u i d made SkyDoesMinecraft popular
*sad stampy cat noises*
hello
Do a video with the hermits
SHEETT IT'S ADAM!
You should do OG Gmodders next.
I love how Dan and Lizzie were in a seriousr interview, and Adam is there just like QUANTUM EXORCISM
do a video interviewing smosh and the cast
"THIS IS ALBERT" best shoutout
Does no one remember Yogscast THAT GIVES ME MEMORIES
Kind of sad that Pat and/or Jen isn't here but I am so happy Lizzie is here, i've been watching them for over five years although the last two years I've only been checking in once in a while i'm so grateful that they were part of my childhood
I would absolutely love watching a part two of this with people like PopularMMOS, Stampylonghead, and JeromeASF
my childhood heros     anyways gonna go cry
Hey Anthony spend a day with famous video game trollers
Its nice to see Adam/Sky/NetNobody again, its been awhile since I heard of him, given he is still doing music instead of completely dropping off the face of the Earth, I hope he has success given his story beyond youtube is a lot more and he deserves success. Also his parts keep me cackling because he is still of high octane energy
dan and lizzie were my whole childhood dude, i watched them for so long dude since i was like 9 or so, and it’s so crazy how much they’ve changed.   definitely for the better, but it’s still insane that i used to watch them constantly. i still love them so much, they made my childhood a lot better :,]
I'm a bit disappointed that Stampy is not here.
Ah finally, some good fucking minecraft players
14:30 She pretty much described it.   I used to watch DanTDM but I grew up and stopped. Although I still have the memories from the time I had watched them still with me.
adam still makes me laugh exactly how he did all those years ago this man really is ahead of his time <3
can you do an interview with people who have FASD? as a sibling of someone with fasd i think it would be an awesome video <3 it’s also not that well known
after all this time...he finally spoke to dantdm
If only stampy was on this
I feel like zackscott is so underated, he was the first MC youtuber (and maybe first ever youtuber) I can remember, his viewership is sadly low when he helped a lot of current youtubers become bigger, I remember when I first found out ldsgadow lady and zack had played, it was so cool, zack is like a forgotten gem
MCYT then > MCYT now
Sky makes me wanna tear up bro
DAN raised a whole generation of children and now he raising one by himself. We came a long way 🥲🥲
Me after seeing Sky again:  *its a bad time to rain…* **crying**
Danton lets goooooooooooooooooooo dude I’ve been watching Dan since I was like 5 which I’m 11 now soooo
Shout out to stampy cat btw he’s a goat
dantdm was my childhood lol
Idea: try to make a original smosh video again with ian
Sky will always have a special spot in my heart
Dan is honestly my childhood youtuber I think I watched him back in 2013 to 2014
Adam carried this video, he's still such a funny guy
I remember Smallishbeans from the CoD days and his transition to Garry’s mods. He introduced Lizzie into the group and she stuck around. Crazy how she’s doing well with Minecraft nowadays
Is it bad I still watch dan and Lizzie
ChimneySwift. PaulSoaresJR. CaptainSparklez. BajanCanadian. JeromeASF. Thinknoodles.
absolute legends
I love ldshadowlady she so kawaii
It's kinda sad that I only know DanTDM 😔
adam literally raised me i cant thank him enough
The only reason I wanted to watch this was because skydoesminecraft is in here
but where popularmmos?
Was not expecting to hear the name "Team Crafted" and be flung into a wave of endless nostalgia so quickly.
Damn Sky is an absolute original legend who just made Dan another original legend
Sky I miss him so dam much, I sad now 😭😭
This makes me so happy
Miss these guys, grew up watching them! Still watch JeromeASF and Ssundee to this day!
That must so annoying to fix the ceiling every video
Bro, my childhood. Thanks sky, thanks dan, thanks mmos, thanks paul, thanks to EVERY OG mc youtuber. you made me ;)
u should do pat and jen :D
We can all agree that stampy would make this video complete.
I don’t get why Sky says he doesn’t upload Minecraft and he does music when it’s the other way round?
If you think Popularmmos’s is not a legend you crazy
Sky is def high lmao
RIP Mighty_Robo Died of Nostalgia 2006 - 0:55
I still watch Dan and sky everything there doing is still amazing
I watched Sky for so long and I feel like as my mental health declined his did too, in a really weird way it was nice to have someone going through something at the same time as me because it made it feel like things were gonna be okay
I love that Adam is still the awesome goofy guy I watched when I was younger. He was the first minecraft YouTuber I've ever watched and I still love going back and watching his old videos. He always puts a smile on my face and keeps my spirits up. I love his music too
Still haven’t moved on from ldshadowlady. I’ve been in love with her and her Channel for 7 ish years now. Lizzie even saved my life.  Forever a shadow cadet.
Fuck man these people basically raised me through my childhood
Dream Stans: Where Dream?
No PopularMMOs? Smh
What about stampylonghead???
spend a day with the smosh crew
Forever remembered ✊🏼
these people really made up my childhood and also Stampy!! then a bit later IHascupquake, Stacyplays, Joey Graceffa!!!
It was really nice to hear Adam's voice again, he's still got that humor from when he made videos with team crafted
Where’s stampy 😢
Stampylonghead  no other words
so nice to see sky is doing well after all the child support shit
I know this is a bit out there but what about smallish streamers to get their life and the struggles like that
Anyone else skipped this random girls parts or just me
my..my..my childhood
What about stampy..
Sky was high af
Bring in Pat for a sequel. Dude is my childhood.
Stampy? Hello?
Yoo where's PH1LZA
When I saw Adam in the title and thumbnail, I got this spark and I felt like I had to watch to remember SkyDoesMinecraft
When I saw Adam in the title and thumbnail, I got this spark and I felt like I had to watch to remember SkyDoesMinecraft
I can't believe Dan is actually a parent. I hope Ash becomes a great kid.
Stampy
I love Ldshadowlady because she’s a girl that plays games like she doesn’t have to do things that are considered girly she can do what she likes and that really inspired me that I can do anything
no stampy vry sad
sky still puts a smile on my face , the mans energy is a gift!
I guess PopularMMos didn't want to join in on the nostalgic trip
Dan and lizze fr RAISED me
The memories just came rushing back right as I heard the names, amazing video, would love to see a second part with more OG’s like SSundee, Bashurverse, or like the Team Crafted members
Being a sky fan from his big boom to his decline and seeing him being able to be happy is so heartwarming
tell sky he saved my live. I was in a bad time in my life when i was in school i just wanna let him know that it will be soo cool to talk to him :D or see him and talk
Omg I just realized stampy should have been here too
0:27 I don’t even care about watching the rest of the video anymore, the og skylanders in the background. I got that game the week it was released 😂
I have a question about otherkins
uhhhhh, where's Pat? (popularmmos)
I miss skydoesmincraft that was the good shit
lizzie!!
Lizzie and Dan are the 2 og mc yts I still watch
ALBERT!!!
you should get stampy
I didn't know zackscottgames made ldshadowlady famous and I watch zack post vids since 2011. I Dont know why zack isn't blowing up on YouTube like crazy?
this brought back some much nostalgia from my childhood
Wish you would’ve asked them how much dedotaded wham you need for a Minecraft server.     Loljk great interview!!
God I now remember why I loved Adam's content so much. Like holy fuck, I havent laughed this hard in so long.
I love sky he’s one of the funniest human beings out there I still go back and watch some of his cops and robbers videos when I need a laugh
this was such a fascinating video! i’ve been watching lizzie for 10 years & she has felt like a family friend for awhile now. i don’t know how she does it but i’ve always felt so happy & comfortable watching & interacting with her & her content, & it was amazing to hear about the journey she & other amazing CCs have had in their rising success
Sky was one of the OG's I watched the most, but AntVenom was the OG that got me into Minecraft and YouTube as a whole. His AntFarm survival series was amazing as a kid. From there I saw Sky in a collab video they did. Then I saw CaptainSparklez who ended up being the basis of a large part of my life. (Mianite was the highlight of middle school). But those three really changed my life in so many ways, along with all the others who I was introduced to through them. The whole community is so special to so many people. I couldn't be happier that its resurfacing as a community and bringing in both older and newer creators
Its crazy how most of the comments are just support for adam instead of the hate he used to get. Glad to see most people know the truth <3
I can't believe you've forgotten about popularMMOs i loved their channel, i still do. 😅
Sky should do a reunion with team crafted again
The memories are coming back to me
The First Time I watched YouTube I clicked a random. Minecraft video. Eventually after many Minecraft videos YouTube started playing Shadowcraft. It’s been 4 years now.
Holy fuck, I havent heard Adam's voice in so long. He sounds the exact same
I love Dan and Adam haven't changed 1 bit since when I used to watch them (Never watched idshadowlady) Especially Adam I hope they're all doing well I grew up watching them for years
Wheres Tobuscus/Toby games? He's like the OG or OGs
Can you feature The Boys the Mully Josh and others their VR content is actually amazing
where the hell is popularmmos
Next we need Bajan Canadian and TBNRFrags
Sky deserves so much better I hope he’s doing well
A different era
OKAY😎
Sky's the best.
Lizzie being acknowledged as an OG Minecrafter makes my day a million times better.
what some ppl tend to forget is that these YouTubers (and celebrities) they're ppl too, just like you and me, they get depressed, they get upset, they get tired, shit happens
16:03 cuz i've got a secret, and i gotta keep it
it's almost been a decade since I have been watching Dan, literally started watching him since I was like 5
me waiting for aphmau/jess
Back when Minecraft youtubers had fanbases that weren’t literal cults
Wish they had stampy😔
can you do a vid on group youtubers? with people like neebs gaming, sidemen, misfits, coldones etc
I want a part 2!!!
Sky is just as entertaining as ever
Kinda wish he asked sky if he misses his early Minecraft days too
I remember when I was like 7 when I was watching LDShadowLadys one life series I would go on my laptop and search "Minecraft one life LDShadowLady free"
4 titans from my childhood
I can’t believe it’s been almost 10 years since I found out who they were
Im so happy minecraft got revived
YOU……YOU FORGOT….. SLAPPYAMONGHEAD Srry if i spell wrong yellow cat
I lov Anthony and his content but I wish he was still in smosh
Where is captainsparklez 😢?
my minecraft youtuber OG was 100% stampylongnose ( stampy cat) my life in middle school haha
4 legends in one single video
Where's Stampy at?
ihascupquake was my og <33
For some reason I remember a skydoesminecraft video where he did an irl eating challenge with like an onion and warheads etc and I could never find the video again. He must’ve privated the video… was an og video I remember when sky had like 1000 subscribers deadass
as a Nonbinary person who watches Jaiden Animations, so excited for the next 2 videos
Pin if i fool you    Read more
you should make a part 2 with popularmos, ssundee, or some other peeps
Remember the old dantdm intro?  Just thinking about it, him reviewing old minecraft mods. Makes me wanna cry
Pat and jen plz there my fav
what about stampy :(
It was also amazing that all the OG’s were voice actors in the Minecraft Story Mode. That was the greatest to live through having all the greatest creators all together.
Popularmmos?
the nostalgia
Skydoesminecraft is the best minecraft youtuber prove me wrong
Where dream?
DUDE I JUST REALIZED YOU’RE FROM SMOSH BRUH
You should do the vanossgaming group
i honestly feel like lizzie is still in her peak but just with a new audience
AAAAA
this is all i needed too exist thank you
the REAL mc youtubers
Albert
i love that sky can still make me laugh then and now i love him i grew up with him and dan
You should have done Jerome SSundee AntVenom CaptainSparklez and a few other people
Sky and pewds were my favorite gaming channels and I never knew that sky was post Malone roommate!!!!
the nostalgia is insane
Ive been with Dan since 2013 and im glad I found him back then :)
is Adam okay?
Adam is just a different breed of human
Sry man but u didn't have philza minecraft on here kinda sus bro.
Anthony was able to go beyond smosh in soo many ways and I'm so proud of that fact
i feel like dan has grown an matured ALOT. seems alot more professional all these years later
they deadass shaped my childhood
...stampycat?
sky was literally my childhood, id watch him everyday and thought he was so funny, i can remember watching his videos and its just so crazy how now like ive grown up but like ill never forget how much i was impacted by minecraft yt
13:21 ‘wait your alive’ 🤣🤣
Man for how long it’s been, Adam hasn’t changed at all, and its amazing😂
Let's all appreciate we grew up with these og minecraft players
Holy crap dude I literally haven't seen these people in ages
Zackscottgames... I haven’t heard that name in a while.
I like how Dan and Lady were like the older, well adjusted cousins that used to do fun things with you when you were younger, but now have lives of their own, while Sky is the Chaotic Neutral Uncle that sneaks you a beer at every family gathering
I remember watching LDshadowlady back in 2012
OMG YES
unironically, lizzie was my childhood. and sky.
started watching lizzie in middle school, i'm in uni now.... wowwww
No stampy cat😐
i wanna become famous to interview old underrated youtubers like Amy, Stacy, and Jen (Yes, I know Jen was popular but not nearly as popular[mmos] as Pat.)
I’m so glad I grew up with them
Also Popularmmos !!!  My childhood!
Shoulda got EthosLab
Do a day with smosh
dan is so handsome omg his glo uppppp
I’ve been watching these people since I was in elementary school…. I turn 21 next year 🥲
adam still has me laughing after all these years hot diggety damn
Adam has gone a lil bit crazy now but uh I’ll be there in three months
I would rewatch shadowcraft and the minecraft party games
I'm glad sky is still going and is super motivated to get his music career that big good for him man I remember all the drama around him and I'm just glad hes doing alright.
It would of been awesome if stampy was in this
I remember watching to much skydoes minecraft playing prison break with friends. Those were so much fun
Uhhh…………Where’s Stampy and Squid?
LDshadowlady made my childhood and to this day I still watch her
skydoesminecraft is the reason why i have friends LMAOOO
Ong DanTDM basically raised me, im thankful he wasn’t a bad person with bad morals, cuz those bad morals would have probably be passed down to younger me lol
Finally Pre Malone
Ldshadowlady basically created my childhood-
Were is stampy
Speaking of ohs who else watches or watched krew, little Kelly and Carly, and aphmaus series?
I remember when I first watched Dan in 2012 when I saw his gangom style mod on minecraft lol
I still watch Lizzie and I’m starting to watch Dan now cuz of my cousins😀✋
We need stampy
When he didnt talk to gizzigazza DID EVERYONE FORGET HIM
Dream is ass these guys r wayyyy better
Are u ever going to make a return on smosh just as a guest star.
The first minecraft video from Lizzie and Dan was on August 12 and 13..... *A Day on and after my birthday- What the heck-*
We need og Minecraft’s 2 with stampy
Imagine if he got the real OGs on the show. the Yogscast
I’m just making sure that we have all our lives and our families will get to the house we need for the first day to go in our room lol we will get you guys soon lol we have a new friend and a family and we have all the best we are in here for sure but if I get kicked in my car I’ll get back with it again tomorrow and get a hold for him to do it and I’ll be there lol
Where’s my boy stampylongnose
So we forgetting popularmmos?
If adam ever sees this tho i doubt  Thank you, you were a father figure to me when i was young
Tf why vikkstar not included this is only fkin game ppl only
Kinda wish captainsparklez was in this vid
Adams videos still bring me joy. It’s always nice to go back to them, because they’re not 100% child friendly, so the older I get, I still can find it funny
My childhood YouTubers: Lizzie,Lauren,Scott,Joel,Yammy,Joey,(basically the whole group of One Life season 2)
Adam looks so happy now :)
You gotta make a part 2 with stampy and  iballisticsquid
Omg its been so long since i heard sky's name and see him. These people is like my childhood damnnn
Wee woooo
I'm sorry but Adam was on so many drugs during that interview bruh he got a little too happy when he said QUANTAM SUPER DEMONS
Other minecraft legend youtubers   Ssundee Vegetta777 willyrex
Lizzie made my childhood
I would love to see if he could get the more technical side of the Minecraft community like ethoslab, Bdubs, etc, they shaped my childhood as well
I loved all of them as a kid and they were my childhood forever it's crazy how long it's been since I consistently watched them
"The nostalgia hits different"
I miss bacon man
What about stampy
my childhood :’) constantly lowering the volume watching sky’s videos was a daily routine in 2012. i still watch lizzie to this day
Albert
YO! SkyDoesMinecraft was my CHILDHOOD!
Interview tobuscus
Adam was my entire childhood, he's so dope
I was so sad that stampy wasn’t here :( BUT DANTDM!
Zack Scott playing Minecraft… it’s been too long
This makes me want a version with some of the og minecraft animators
Just rediscovered this channel (haven’t heard or thought of it since you left SMOSH) and I gotta say… this is amazing now. You’ve really used your massive reach to make such cool and unique videos that hit perfectly. Amazing job, +1 sub :)
POPULARMMOS NEXT
I love seeing Adam is still himself and didn’t change one bit :’)
These minecrafters are my childhood, would've loved to see stampylongnose there❤❤
I loved these people as kids I wish I didn’t grow out of them
Popularmmos
yeah they ARE legendary not Dream
Me watching this who's only watched Dan the little club and pat and Jen : 👁️👄👁️
I love Lizzie she molded my childhood💚
They were our childhoods not ledgendary og Minecrafters
literally these people raised me like no joke-
stampy is still posting
What about ssundee?
Idk if you can but you should do technoblade he's one of the best Minecraft pvp people
Well Lizzie did managed to eat the vegetables that she grows in her garden LOL LIFE GOAL ACHIEVED 😂❤️
Looking forward to the upcoming videos so much!
Can you do “Spent a day with registered sex offenders” next
We need to see more from the ex Team Crafted member
Well that's one way to get easy clicks
wheres ian
Oh my lord I totally forgot about ZackScott
Freaking loved their videos as a younger child… makes me miss the past!!
I love how Dan and LDShadowLady actually shouted out some stuff, while sky showed albert and that's it lol. Sky hasn't changed.
DanTDM was such a major support in my childhood, his lab videos and overall everything he created during my childhood inspired me and helped me and to this day I look back on those days wishing it was the same, especially how much he helped my autistic brother come out of his shell and really was an amazing influence on him. Then Ldshadowlady was such an amazing person, her channel inspired me to be myself and helped me so much, and I don't think I'd be here today without her. I just wish there was some way to thank these people who helped me so very much
I like Albert he’s pretty cool, I’ll subscribe to the Albert YouTube channel
This was epic
3 hours before assignment is due  15:21
Honestly I really like DanTDM’s new content. Yeah he changed his content. But it didn’t really change the vibe you get from the videos
childhood memories unlock
Anthony Padilla is now going to be part of the E crafters
10:22 such a big part of my childhood, I wish I could tell him thank you lmao
SKYYYYYYYYY
I would love to see Captainsparklez in one of these videos
Lets be honest. All big youtubers get sponsored by honey...
I feel so bad for leaving these channels when Minecraft started dying.
Ldshadowlady!
Party 2! Stampy, Pat and Jen, Captain Sparkles.
i’ve been watching Dan for 8 years now…
everyone’s saying they’re childhood legends like anthony isn’t one himself
Yo Anthony what about you? When you were in smosh you made my childhood
Seeing how happy these people are makes me cry. Im so happy for all of them. Dantdm and sky were such a major part of my childhood. I still watch their videos.
Pls do another one with iballisticsquid and stampy!!
Adam is on a different astral plane now
LDShadowLady!! Wow. She’s amazing as ever
People here: these people are my childhood Me: yogscast
Hearing Sky’s voice again made me wanna she’d many… many tears
Interview nursery rhyme channels
Damn I felt like I was just a kid yesterday
Was I the only one who watched popularmmos
Wheres popularmmos and jen
We need one with stampycat he made my childhood
part 2 and have BajanCanadian on if you can, I think he would have a lot of interesting stuff to say and add to this conversation, especially because he recently privated all of his videos and is basically no longer in the spotlight at all
ok but where's stampy
Reject Modernity   Embrace Tradition
I was Just thinking about all the og minecraft YouTubers
Idea: I spent a day with Virtual Farmers
Is anyone else wondering why popularmmos isn’t here?
Man, I remember when LDShadowLady joined Scottland. Brings back a lot of memories.
This video literally put a smile to my face seeing YouTubers I used to watch it just made me happy
I watched all of theses Youtubers when I was little and I still do.😁
Man minecraft was like a double edged sword for adam im glad he moved and to bigger and better things
Anthony's production value and quality is up there and i love it :DD
I didn't realize it was THAT long ago!
I came for lizzie and Dan..  my og faves
Dream, Technoblade, Quackity and all those other new mc youtubers will NEVER have anything on these legends.
WHERE IS STAMPY
Bro sky is a legend I swear
Man I grew up watching these people. I feel so old now. :P
Makes me want to see one of these for the Yogscast because they had a major impact on YouTube today. All the of the stuff Dream and friends are doing they did years ago.
WE NEED TECHNOBLADE ON THE SHOW PLEASE
Where is vikkstar123??
Maybe do a part two with Stampylonghead, PopularMMOS (both pat and Jen together) and ssundee. If you do a part three my suggestions are captain sparkles, crainer, and kehaan
Having stampylonghead would've been legendary
I love it how Anthony interviews the people. Everyone is so comfortable with him and his questions.
20:11 There is an alternate universe where this man is a Prophet      The Alternate universe is 2014.
i’ve been watching ldshadowlady for 8 years now and i didn’t even realize it until she said how long she’s been doing youtube
OG minecrafters... We aren't that old are we?
there are so many more OG minecart youtubers sad he couldn't fit them all in
I would have liked to see popularmmos on this, since he has gone through so much in recent years.
sad captainsparklez wasn't a part of this
I wish Technoblade was also a part of it.
I'm a simple person, I see LDShadowLady on the thumbnail, I click
0:13 I never seen adam long hair
Don’t mind me, just waiting for part 2 so I can see Popularmmos
woah
where’s stampy, and pat and jen :(
I grew up with these youtubers so I like this video
I hope adam is ok
I just need to say that Sky and LD literally got me through the worst part of my life and now that I’m seeing this interview it’s def where I got my unwavering self confidence LMAOOO thanks for making this I missed them
Now this is what I want to see. Thank you for doing this honestly.
Hey of you do a second one of these try to get ssundee on this
SKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY I MISSED HIM
YOU FORGOT STAMPY
this was good, but where is stampy???
Who else here is only here for LDShadowlady!?!
I used to live ldshadowlady
I wish aphmau or stampi was there unu but love lazy and the others uwu
this video made me want to play Minecraft
the REAL Minecraft Youtubers
Hearing sky's voice is awesome after all these years
I'm disappointed that Stampy isn't in this video
The YouTuber house builds on dans channel is where I started YouTube
I wished PopularMMOs was here in this video
My minecraft username is: Budder
Whatever Lizzie puts out in her videos we will love no matter what ! Lizzie can make anything and it still be entertaining :)
i still go back and watch sky’s content to this day, all of his old stuff is still as funny on the 50th watch as it was the first it’s a shame everything that happened to the lad but i appreciate everything he did for my childhood
Sorry anthony but not really OG. maybe sparklez. you want OG minecraft try SeaNanners, DavidYT, BananaPielord....
DanTDM > basically every minecraft youtuber
Anthony spent a day with jelly,Slogoman and crainer.
I WILL CRY
I wanted ssundee in this video
i miss u being in smosh :(
SKY!!!!!
Adams a ghost buster
Where is captain sparkles
I have a question
As a non-binary person who came out recently when I heard about an episode with non-binary people I was supper exited and glad because it’s kind of like a recognition of the fact that we do exist. I’m just supper exited and can’t wait! Thank you Anthony!
To think none of the cringy Minecraft kids have no idea who Sky is that's upsetting.
I'm happy that 30% of my childhood is here.
Ayo what about stampy
Yes… zucchini is a fruit.
Growing up I watched DanTDM all the he is my favourite YouTuber no offense to all the other creators ldshadowlady I like forgot for a few years and seeing how far they've come just makes me cry hold up I'm having a moment
Shout out to the OG Minecraft youtubers who didn’t become pedophiles :)
wheres stamps
Come back to smosh pls
Dream is temporary but Dantdm is forever
adam; they chased me in minecon dan; they asked me for a picture while peeing lizzy; I SIGNED A VEGETABLE
where is stampy? :((
You should have brought Stampylonghead as well, that guy was a legend
25B?? Am
these guys are responsible for my humor
We need to see Stampy, PopularMMOs, ect.!
I always loved ldshadowlady and I still do
this video was great but i"m really sad stampys not in this. Maybe one on one???
Seeing Adam is amazing- it's been forever and it seems the happiness he brought me all those years ago is still there. Love Albert, love him, and I cant wait for those three months to pass. Keep being you and keep being happy 💖 you'll get those 5 billion
I think it was 2016 I wanted to go see Dan when he was in Nashville but me and my parents were confused about it and I never got to see him
but no smallish beans/??
Wheres stampy
Shame ssundee wasn't here
Lizzie was and still is such a comfort for me,during my very traumatic childhood she always made me happy,I’m so happy that she’s still around and still doing what she loves, Her,Dan and Adam were the only  Minecraft YouTubers that I ever watched but I stopped watching Dan and Adam a few years ago but I always remembered them and will never forget them,they raised so many people and made so many childhoods,absolute legends
Lizzie was and still is such a comfort for me,during my very traumatic childhood she always made me happy,I’m so happy that she’s still around and still doing what she loves, Her,Dan and Adam were the only two Minecraft YouTubers that I ever watched but I stopped watching them a few years ago but I always remembered them and will never forget them,they raised so many people and made so many childhoods,absolute legends
i never stopped watching Ldshadowlady, like- i enjoy her alot
seeing adam with the long hair  is such a moment to realize that its been so long since we've seen him play and make his minecraft videos ages ago
I still watch Lizzie since her videos always give me comfort. Her videos haven't change and that's comforting for me. Although I change personality and my whole base of myself, I will never stop watching her videos.
the thing is i still watch dantdm and ldshadowlady
albert
wheres stampy tho?
It's funny that it says 35.1 billion views buy there aren't even 8 billion people on the planet
I remember that DanTDM's Herobrine mod showcase was the first minecraft video I ever saw.  Then Stampy had the first minecraft series I ever watched, The Lost Sword map playthrough and his Lovely World. And then one of my friends introduced me to LDShadowlady and I watched all of her Shadowcraft and CrazyCraft videos.  All of this being 2014-2015. I was, what, 8 or 9? Holy shit it's been nearly 8 years.  And now I'm a DSMP and Hermitcraft fan...wow
The fact that stampy isnt here is suprising, i hope Anthony Will do a part 2 with other.
Will the next video be Anthony Padilla talks to Ian Hecox again?
Sky's minecraft song that part where it goes "mine mine minecraft" made me tear up
Adams music is actually pretty good, so I highly recommend giving it a listen
I come to realise how much I fucking love this series
He should do one with Stampy... An og just like Anthony and the others in this video... Just saying
The amount of nostalgia in this video is making me cry
@dantdm
These legends were our childhood. They gave us our best memories when we were young.
oh my god adam shaped my childhood im so happy to see him here i hope he's doing well
SkyDoesMinecraft FOUNDED my childhood and i wish he made more old school vids
where popularmmos?
courgette, chatzilim, zuchini, eggplant, same difference.
Interview of Wilbur Soot
ldshadowlady: shoutout to my husband dantdm: subscribe to anthony padilla sky: *a l b e r t*
i started watching lizzie when i was in 6th grade, and to this day i still watch her!! and i graduated from highschool this year! i think that just goes to show how great her videos are🤍
If he’d even want to, I think EthosLab would be a great person to interview in a sequel. One if the only channels I’ve been watching since I started watching YouTube, even at times when I didn’t play Minecraft.
LSDShadowLady: Shoutout to Shadow Cadettes + Smallish Beans  Adam: *albert*
Huh, no davidangel64 / davidr64yt (“X” from X’s Adventures in Minecraft)? Maybe it’s just because he was playing different games for a while…
So sad stampy s not here 😢😭😔
ANTHONY YOU WERE IN THE ANGRY BIRD MOVIE 2       WOW!!
Dan's my fav youtuber ever
I don’t know about you all but I’m still watching Ldshadowlady and forever will <3 also so happy she came out as bi love her
I miss Adam so much love his music tho
God skydoesminecraft was my entire childhood. I watched his videos everyday. I remember when he first revealed his face at one million. It was the biggest thing
Omg Skydoesminecraft.
anthony - Legendary old ass artifacts from Minecraft Dan - I'm 29
I can't believe stampy and paulsauresjr aren't here
Dan and adam literally created my childhood
I wonder what will happened if u add pat and Jen
the cat man
If Stampy was here
He should have interviewed stampy
You should do one like this but with role-play Minecraft YouTubes
where's stampy :(
where's SSundee and Crainer
These people were there for me when my own parents weren't so seeing them again and knowing they're okay and happy is really great to know. Loved the video!
Hey i have a video suggestion. I spent a day with pyrocynical
Wheres stampy?
damn wheres captain sparklessssss DONT GET ME WRONG Lizzie is my favorite YouTube ever I grew up with her the woman practically raised me lol and I still watch all of her videos! but captain really did some cool stuff for the community
Damn last time i watched u you were in smosh. Glad to see ur doing well and getting to spend a day with everyones childhood
im kinda sad that ssundee isnt in here KEKW
Sky was one of the first first YouTubers I watched and I watched all of his videos on all of his channels until he said he was quitting
I'm crying
21:05 You spelt his name wrong Anthony (Trayaurus)  Don’t worry, everyone makes mistakes
You need to do one with legendary clash of clans youtubers like ssundee, masterov, havoc for example
You know Adam's humor is so ahead of the time when you notice his humor has not changed at all but it can still make you laugh as much as it did before.
You should do stampy and iballisticsquid
Dantdm and popularmmos were my childhood minecraft YouTubers       Dude the memories 😭
Lizzies hair is so pretty! Omg
Where techno?
Watching people that shapes our childhood made my day
Loved Dan and Lizzie since young ♥️
I've watched Lizzie forever and I'm so happy she gets fame she deserves it
remember lizzie's whole 'gaming banter' playlist that was chock full of swearing lmao
I’ve been watching ldshadowlady for 6/7 years I don’t exactly remember I just remember I was in grade 1🥰 (I just turned 13 today btw)
We need another with Simon and Lewis from YogsCast pls
all of them really raised me when I was 9 especially sky. I miss them all for real.
Where’s Stampy?
I still watch ldshadowlady i am 18 but sky and Dan were actually my childhood  Sky went though a lot losing his wife and stuff  Stay strong my dude
i aactually cried this is so nice to watch they were all a big part of my childhood
funny how sky is probably one of the most wealthy MC YTers and has the worst camera quality out of these three.
dantdm really was my father figure, i love him sm
dantdm really saved me so many times as a kid
Sad that Stampy wasn't in this video
I love how sky acknowledged the fact he lived with post malone for awhile
he spelt trayaurus's name wrong lol
I'm just gonna wait for og youtubers part 2 w/ Pewdiepie, Tobuscus, and Smosh[Ian].
wheres stampy?
dislikes are npjust Dinnerbones
Adam was my whole childhood!!! I used to wait on my computer for his uploads!! 😭
I’m pretty sure Dan was the first person I ever watched😗
I love vids bro 😇 God bless you❤️❤️
can u do "i spent a day with bisexual's"
yall remember YAW (YouAlwaysWin) their dumb and dumber videos were great
My god if stampy is not OG then the sun is not real.
should do a part 2 with popularmmos, stampy, bajan, and just those guys
Damm I wanna know what song was playing in the background!
I remember one of my friends just hated skydoesminecraft for no reason he just didnt like him well he doesnt like minecraft youtubers like dream today so maybe he just has something against popular minecraft youtubers but he did like dantdm so Idk
Sky is still has that goofy cadence
I'm happy but also a bit sad cause Popularmmos isn't here :(
Adam Practically Raised me i was going through some shit back then, Proud to have been born in the same area as him lmao
How about PopularMMOS
do stampy plz
I didn't even notice ShadowLady was in ZackScott server. It was way too old and I did watched them a long time ago. It was such a great server. I am happy to be one of the those watch og minecrafters in the golden ages.
but where was stampy?
part 2 for stampylonghead
yay non-binary people are next! I'm happy we're getting representation!
17:58 Yea
The nostalgic
Bacon Man, Pancake Pal, Pancake Paula, Hashbrown Hank...... Damn Its been a long time
Proud to say I grew up watching them
Honestly, Zackscottgames is very underated
My excitement from seeing Adam here, it's like I was 14 again for a second. The memories of Adam and his crew raising my YouTube self, those were the days omg
How many holes have you been making?
Havent seen these legends for years
Dan looks like a jerk friend of mine in the thumbnail ...  no offense man ...
Bruh u should’ve done popularmmos and RyGuyRocky
Deffo need popularmmos
Man. I miss Zack Scott. Now he just makes vids on PVZ2. And he on like episode 5k of that series. Wish he refreshed his channel with something else. 😔
Why are most og mc yts brits
I YELLED SO MUCH I HAVENT SEEN SKYDOESMINECRAFT IN A LONG TIME AHHHHH
popular mmos and gamingwithjen😩
I  Miss pops
ADAM POST YOUR MUSIC!!!! PARANOIA LITTERALLY GOT ME THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL!!! LA LIGHTS WAS ICONIC!!!!! I NEED THE NET NOBODY CONTENT!!!
shoulda got popularmmos in this too
Oh to be a child in the early 2000's. Watching minecraft videos, playing Pokémon games on the DS while your parents fight downstairs. I mean,, what?
It kinda makes me sad that the younger generation isn't growing up with good YouTubers who actually care about their content and that make them feel like kids. Maybe they'll find these OGs and another cycle will begin, but I showed my siblings them and they got bored so :[
Bruh what about Yogscast man? Lewis and Simon need some recognition too
Not me hoping Stampy would be in this video 😂
Maybe Sky can someday be at the level of his old friend *Post Malone*.  This is a true story, but Post Malone used to be a part of Team Crafted and was seen alongside with a couple of the other members of Team Crafted.
The fact that dantdm gives a shout out to dr. Trayaurus and ssundee can't even mention derp ssundee once makes me sad.
LDShadowLady and Stampy raised me basically ,
In ur dreams
Hey anthony do a spending a day with the most subscribed youtube channel before pewdiepie
So happy that Zack Scott's server got mentioned. That series was my childhood
I’d love it if you sat down and talked to some OG let’s players! Names like chuggaaconroy, lucahjin, joshjepson, etc etc
“⟟ expect people to move on from my channel…”   Me, still watching her since 2016
Anyone else think Adam was on drugs 😂
Sky!!!
wheres stampy sad
should do a part two with popularmmos, captain sparklezz, stampy, etc
I miss these YouTubers
it’s so good to see adam happy omg :’)
Where is think noodles?
samgladiator>everyone else
popularMMos?
aw i grew up with lizzie , watching every step of her journey . i still watch her to this day , and im 19 now <3
STOP SKYDOESMINECRAFT- IM CRYING
Dans shirt looks kinda sus 😳
What about Stampy? It’s like we all forgot about him 😔
Spend a day with smosh
where's technoblade.
Yo I haven't seen Adam since he stopped making videos because I never go on instagram so if he does post I haven't seen them, and I've never imagine Adam with longer hair like omg, it actually looks good on him!! I also heard he has custody of Mason which is awesome!
it would have been wierd if u got stampylongnose on this episode
Where is Stampy ?
The subtitles on minecraft videos really help me because my brain is stupid and can't process audio that well
Stampylonghead??
Lord knows I used to watch Sky's Cops & Robbers video after middle school EVERY SINGLE DAY
Sky is more funnier then ever he was the funniest youtubers from my childhood but he’s gotten even better over time he’s the funniest man i watch
The interview is so calm and then the adam bits it kills me lmao
still no ETHOSLAB .... im dissappointed
Sky living with Post Malone is insane !
0:20 bruh league was once more popular than minecraft
I wish stampylongnose was in this video he was actually my childhood
Ever thought of talking to simmers I know it might not be exactly what you do but they've been around about the same time as minecrafters or maybe even talk to YouTube OG's like yourself loved this video by the way :)
i wish he was still in smosh
Bro Adam was 100% stoned during this
ADAM
I'm not a subscriber but I remember when Lizzie was just starting out. I found her through The RPGMinx, I though she was so entertaining and cute. I'm so hapoy to see her still thrive.
Sky is on an ascended plane here
These guys sculpted and created many childhood Im so freaking thankful for them for making those videos back in the day!
What about Stampy?
Pat/Popularmmos should have been here
The better days
Dantdm ur my 2nd fav youtuber if u r watching this i did not stop watching ya im still here im litarlly crying u were my childhood u r my child hood u will be my child hood
Anyone else find Sky/Adam through his RuneScape content way before MC?
"Because existing is exhausting" I relate to this to much
oh my god I use to be the biggest fan of Adam holy shit
Bruh where's stampy cat
:D
IM SO HAPPY TO HEAR SKY AFTER SO MANY YEARS HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S DOING WELL THESE DAYS I FEEL SO GROWN UP NOW
The fact that stampy isn’t here is actually crazy.
im a simple man. i see adam, i click
Adam is my favorite person to ever grave YouTube. His channel will always be a happy memory for me. The videos he made fueled my passions and who I am today so I’m forever grateful to him. :)
Isn't Dan like 40 years old
Sky was actually one of the first ppl o subscribed to on YouTube same with smosh :)
I am so happy that sky was able to be in this video. If you are seeing this sky, you are amazing and I love your music la lights banger and I remember the good old days when you would do those do not laughs, that has mad me the happiest child and helped me get through some things.
The first few frames I saw of them almost made me cry
:)
Where Pat aka PopularMMos
God i love Lizzie so much she was basically my childhood
I would love pt 2 with stampy squid etc
One day, Anthony will visit the Smosh studios but not like coming back...
nostalgia. nostalgia. NOSTALGIA.
Where tf is poppularmmos
I wish popularmmos could also be interviewed
Ok ok, hear me out.   I spent a day with Hermitcraft?
Eyo where's PopularMMO?!
Dan and Sky are the reason I played Minecraft when I was younger
It's crazy because as time goes on we are becoming our parents, meaning we "youngsters" like the old generation content than the new modern content
Wat did I just hear ni HACHU
Sky was my childhood
when is I spent a day with Technoblade coming?
Adams old videos never get boring and are always entertaining. I've watched his vids at least 30 times and I would watch them again when I feel down or when I'm bored.
Stampy should have been there
Im 19 years old…. I’m never going to stop watching Lizzie 🥺
0:05 casually falls from the roof
Stampy?
Anthony and Dan was my idol as a kid I looked up to them. I’ve always thinking about making a yt channel as a kid but never got to till now I never got Anthony’s jokes as a kid till now
These are the cringe Minecraft old yters we need the real ogs
Dantdm > Dream. Stay mad dream stans.
Anthony!.... ohh the nostalgic. Thank you YouTube recommendation, very cool
Shout out to Albert
do a god gamers vedio
Og mcyt are my life, They raised me
Adam our beloved
I grew up with them! I miss the good days! Love seeing sky!❤️
When i saw SkyDoesMinecraft i wanted to give him squid
Lizzie is a humanoid ray of sunshine. And I love that she shouted Joel out. They really stick together and it's so sweet 💛
It’s crazy to think I started watching Lizzie in 2013 and now it’s almost been a decade. So glad to see she’s still going strong
Gotta have good ol' CaptainSparklez at some point lol
yooo nice
Sky is one of my hero’s
Dude, hearing adams voice again makes me so happy.
Please do popularmmos
Cool vid but would have liked it more if ssundee was in it
DanTDM the og
You should have got stampy on here
These people created my childhood.
How would you have Dantdm and ldshadowlady in this, but not captainsparklez. Everybody thinks of him with minecraft
Do one more with smallish
I love Lizzie so much, ive been watching her for over 5 years, she was my whole childhood and even my parents we're surprised the other day when I told them that I still watch her. Her videos were there for me when I was having bad times in life and made me smile and laugh when nothing else could. I love her new and old videos and wouldn't trade her or her channel for the world :)
4:14 You have no idea how nostalgic it is to hear Adam say “I’m bacon” again
Skydoesminecraft:dead channel  LDshadowlady:is a girl  Dantdm: 1/10 videos is minecraft
where is stampy
I SAW LIZZIE AND I CLICKED
I’m just thankful. So much. To each of these beautiful people. I am now the person I am thanks to them :D
Anthony: You have 5 seconds to shout out anything you want  Adam: *THIS IS ALBERT*
I love Lizzie!!!
Adam, Aphmau, Slyfoxhound, and Amylee33 were some of the first minecraft youtubers i ever saw, and basically molded my love for watching lets plays, along with glem3 & dafmak339 and WiiLikeToPlay
Dan talking to mobs in Minecraft is such a mood
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
When I herd about dantdm saying how terorus spoke it destroyed my hole childhood
Watching stuff like this always depresses me omg I wish it was 2012 forever
Died
The person missing here is stampy
ALBERT
who else looked at the comments to see if any of them commented
What about stampyyyyyy
I wish stampy cat was here
Holy crap my childhood!!! Adammmmmmm
dan was literally who got me into the youtube world, i watched him all the time and he helped me through a lot even tho i wasn’t aware at the time. it’s nice to hear them talk about how they felt during that time because i wouldn’t understand it then but i do now and i hope they are all taking care of themselves and that they don’t feel pressured to pump out content <3
one thing is missing, stampylonghead
Dantdm was HUMONGOUS part of my childhood
i kinda wish popularmmos in this
Why not do a interview with youtubers who make roleplays. Not necessarily minecraft, but like cosplay, and other stuff of the sorts
Cool to have who you had but I would have loved to see some of the yogscast or mindcrack people
Where is stampy
You can't say og Minecraft YouTubers and not mention stampylongnose and ibalisticksquid
i still watch lizzie till this day
DanTDM and SkyDoesMinecraft where the goats. Made my childhood better 🙏🙏
ACTUALLYYYYY MORIA ELIZABETH STARTED THE LITTLE MEME THINGS
Adam is literally my hero omg
I’m assuming you couldn’t get stampy lol
I forgot about all the og minecraft youtubers until my little cousin was watching DanTDM and i was like "You watch him?!?" and apparently he also watches other og youtubers too like Sky Does Everything
Where is stampy though??
I watched Adam from the beginning to the end of his channel and I’m proud that he is okay now. Also Lizzie I still watch sometimes XD
where's popularmmos :,[
Do A Technoblade interview
I still watch ldshadowlady guys wdym it’s not “I used to watch your channel” say “I watch your channel a lot ever since I was a kid” or sum smh
We need like stampy, etho, the other members of team crafter, pat etc
“Oh a pige..ohhhh”
skydoesrs and dantdm is my childhood especially grim and dr t 😂
Sky and dan have to be my favorite YouTubers of all time
James BloNd
Albert
where is stampy? he was my childhood bro
God I love Adam, dude always made me laugh so hard. Glad he’s doin alright and I wish the best for him
I kinda hoped Anthony would interview StampyLongHead cuz he's our childhood XD
why is venom extreme not here smh
I always love Adam he saved me in my child hood and I would smile for hours watching his videos I lvoe them I feel so bad for what happened to him but Im so proud of him getting better and will always love him <3
BUTTERRRRRRRRRR 🧈
The minecraft song sky made that parodied Coldplay actually slapped
Sky has had it the worst
Wish stampy was there
Smosh isnt the same without you :C
Good to see Adam doing good!! That guy was my childhood.
sit down with Ian
it's good to see adam smiling and laughing edit: i'm also so fucking proud of anthony like i forgot how good his videos were. truly made my childhood. a legend for real
very sad that a tuber like skydoesminecraft doesnt make minecraft vids but its also cool seeing him do something else, The nostalgia, you will be missed :(
Ayo where Popularmmos?
I didn’t know how to subscribe to people back then, so everyday when I came home from school, I would go to Adam’s channel, watch his newest videos, then go to Dan’s channel and watch his. (I did this w/ Stampy too)
I remember watching Lizzie and then stopping for awhile after growing up a bit… but then when I grew up even more I rediscovered her and all her friends and I’m hooked again. Golden content like hers really does last!
back before i know pewdiepie,i thought dantdm was the best youtuber in the world
Skydoesminecraft was my favorite minecraft channel back then i was a fan ever since he made adventure map content and i stopped watching his videos eventually because you know people grow up and they grow out of things which i think is only natural. it makes me so happy to see him enjoy what hes doing now and he was a part od my life ill never forget
so glad this popped up on my feed
yo
Adam is looking good still. Glad to see it.  Edit: Maybe a little high
Technically philza would be a og minecrafter lol
SKY DOES MINECRAFT???!!!! WOOWW! Hes like a legend from the past! Im glad hes back and doing well! Man i got into minecraft because of him and his videos on mods! man i love this guy  and im glad hes okay.
SCOTTLAND! Now that’s a throwback. Loved the ZackScott days
Stampylonghead???
MY CHILDHOOD HELLO??
one time when I was younger I got a skydoesminecraft backpack, I never watched him I just saw minecraft and said, "mom. I want." the following school year the only things people would ask me are "wow you watch skydoesminecraft too?!"
Where’s stampy 🔪
It's Albert 😯
Skydidminecraft
Have you heard Sky's music? The dude's been way out classed by Post Malone and weighed down by Minecraft to the point that the game IS his music. Just give up that dream and stick with the success you already have, bro
I used to watch Sky all the way until he quit doing Minecraft videos. I watched him everyday at lunch in high school. I still watch Lizzie ^^
Sky and dan are my OG YouTubers, ive been watching them sense I was 4 and now I'm 15
OG Skydoesminecraft. Fuckin legend 🔥
Post Malone’s time with Team Crafted actually helped him to go big. He had no money and Jason (MCUniverse) brought him out to LA and lived with him for awhile.
I just got so much nostalgia of watching skydoesminecraft, thatguybarney, aphmau, ldshadowlady and a lot of others dreaming that i wanted to be like them
Ok. Ok. This is the right path Anthony.
Butter man
Damn... I cried from nostalgia.
Yooo I used to watch sky like everyday back in like 2013
SKYYYYYYYYYY
How long ago was this filmed, Adam isn’t really making music anymore and is back into Minecraft
My friend: Hey lets watch some Minecraft videos! Me: Who we watching today huh, Bajancanadian, Skydoesminecraft My Friend: Skydoeswhat? I think you misheard me, im talking about Dream Tommyinnit, Sapnap,  *Up music starts playing*
Noooo why not Jardonnnnn
I grew up with every single person in this video, they made me go through such tough times. Sky specifically made my days so much easier, I had the biggest laughs from him and his friends. Lizzie made such cute and soothing videos, the unicorn ones made me so excited. And Dan had me glued to the screen from the editing and just.. wow. I’m so happy seeing them all here
"zack scott games" i haven't heard that in about 7 years damn
wtf sky does demon banishment!?!??!?!?!?!
YouTube will never be the same again, but it was an honor in being on this journey, seeing the youtubers we grown up with grow and change. o7
but where's stampy tho
damn, y'all got my childhood in one video lol
All of them but NOT STAMPY
Skydoesminecraft was one of the first youtubers i ever watched even tho I did not speak English I grew up with American youtubers I speak fluent English now
Dude, I remember when me and my sisters would just remake some the adventures that both Dan and Sky. Also how much we would to the music video Sky did. And Lizzie is still as amazing as I remembered her! I love seeing the memories again!
I havent heard of skydoesminecraft in a while now
when lizzie was uploading rarely, i got so scared thinking that the person who raised me better than anyone did might leave youtube soon. but now she's more alive than all of me combined.
Wish popularmmos was in this, oh well
god adam is still so damn funny
I can see Anthony not from smosh and Adam being friends
Lizzie was the first YouTuber I ever watched. Her content has been making me smile for many years. She has made such a big impact on me and I adore her.
i literally cried when i saw dan on the thumbnail
Ay yo anthony, you should spend a day with the sidemen, they are some of the og's of youtube
Damn...ZackScott was really fun to watch yet no one really talks about him when they think of OG Minecrafters
Where the FUCK is Captain sparklez? The literal face of oh Minecraft
Hatkid is worth it
I wonder if anthony was shrimping for Adam
I'm glad Sky is ready to talk about the downfall, it's good to see him happy now.
m8 dan and adam are still the same i love it
I’m so glad that Adam is doing well!
childhood legend speaking to other childhood legends
Yeah, I remember back then... I watch DanTDM everyday after school. Currently, imo there's no one that can top these people
Its funny cause when I was a child-child [3] I vividly remember watching Lizzy's letsplay episodes, she made my childhood, and is still, even though I'm now 13, I still watch her sometimes and I enjoy it, it still has that nostalgic feeling I remember.
I’m so happy this was on the trending YouTube for me to come across this video
I feel like there should be a pt 2 with popularMMOs, PrestonPlayz, and Lachlan
KSI obliterated SkyDoesMinecraft lol
Like Everyone else these creators were everything to me. Lizzie is the first every minecraft youtube i watch and DAMN it's been 7 years 😭❤️ ILY LIZZIE and please know that u dont have to change your recipe or time schedule we love you no matter when and what u post
I used to watch Dan and LD, I guess I'm not to young 🥳 stampy was my favorite tho
If only ihascupquake was here😔
Still can’t believe he didn’t get stampy
EVERYONE get Adam (sky) to 5 billion views for his music!!!
thank god you did og youtubers. if you did the knew mcyts id kms tbh
Sky is a chad
Please do technoblade interview
Would’ve been dope to get popularmmos
Remember PopularMNOs?
Me looking for stampy:
OH SHIT👀✨️
It’s so surreal to see two of my favourite people from when I was younger, Adam and Anthony, just talk about things when they’re both doing way different content than what I grew up with. Props to both of you for having the courage to branch away from ‘your legacy’ to do great things
You should definitely interview the hermit craft people, it would be super interesting to hear more about them.
Should have gotten Stampy
Albert
I actually got emotional at the beginning of the video cause it’s hurts to think that I drifted away from some things
Dan, Lizzie, and Adam practically raised me I love them so muchhhh
i saw dan and IMMEDIATLY CLICKED
My GUY SKY IS BACK  There’s nothing more legendary then SkyDoesMinecraft.
even though i don’t watch these people anymore i sincerely wish them the best! they’ve kept me entertained for years and i hope they can keep doing what they love
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN! :D
We need SkyComesBackToMinecraft
I remember watching Adam as like a 10 year old and he would curse, so I would always have to watch the videos soo quietly, to keep my parents from realizing I was watching Youtube videos with cursing in them. Man, I was living life on the edge.
video idea: I spent a day with rhythm gamers
whats really messing me up is that there is no tobuscus
Is it just me, or did they put the green light on the wood to make it look like dirt blocks? or am i just looking too into it? if not, really nice detail!!!!
Bruh you forgot stamps and PopularMMO
I wanted to see aphmau
Stampy ?
I love Lizzie, she’s the cutest. I’m 15 and I still watch her videos 🙈
DanTdm 🥰🥰🥰
SO PAT FROM POPULARMMOS IS NOT AN OG THIS GOT PERSONAL
Lizzie was my FAVORITE YouTube for my entire childhood
*i'm furious stampy wasn't here >;( /j*
what abt popularmmos???
i love how dan shouted out dr trayauras, lizzie shouted out her fans and her husband, and the sky was just like "this is albert!"
Omg skydoesminecraft😭
My favourite series form each creator  LdShadowlady: Crazy Craft  DanTDM: Hardcore Series  I Have never watched Skye does Minecraft
BACON MAN!!! MY CHILDHOOD HERO!!
but stampy
I miss these guys….😭  Re-watching all the videos you’re more famous Youtubers makes me remind myself of my past my family moved around a lot we were paying off my sister‘s medical bills he has CF in the grace of God we finally paid off but I didn’t have any friends mostly bullies that were making fun of me or just throwing crap at me one time I I had a big swollen eyes because A kid threw a football at my face and my sister was my bully  too but she changed a lot but long story short YouTube,anime And rescue me from the reality of my life it  save me for my depression Watch all these famous you tuber Aphmau, Skydose Minecraft , Captain sparkle, sundee,craner, New scape pro,yogscast, Dan TDM, shadow lady,thank noodles and stampy so thank you for being a part of my life and making me so that I can be myself around people I have a bunch of friends now what is the bar busy with their own way but they always think of me and always come over and help me out or try to cheer me up so for the bottom of my heart thank you so much for being a big impact of my life
"Love ya pewds. Suck my blood. Suck me... my blood out" -Anthony Padildo
Can you do technoblade
Im kinda sad popuarlarmmos and stampy are not here
I thought Captain sparklez would be in this.
Dan, Thanks for going on tour that was the highlight of my 2016.     I still have my signed diamond sword
Technoblade please
It's been a decade??? Time flies
wheres my boy popularmmo
MY CHILDHOOD HAS JUST COLLIDED
21:03 THEY SPELLED DR TRAYAURUS’S NAME WRONG AHHHHHHHHH
The lack of stampy is angering
im upset phiza isnt here
Dan and Lizzie are just casual and then there’s Adam: *DeM°n$!!*
BRUH imagine him and Eminem
Honorable mention, seananners...which I believe was the first to upload on minecraft.
Bro where tf is stampy
Yo bro you should do a video with the Vanoss, Delirious, Moo, Terroriser, or any one of the friends
I still refer to anything gold as budder in my mind thanks to Sky :)
I wish Captainsparklez and Popularmmos were in here. Still love these 3, but sparklez and popularmmos were my childhood
Sky looks like post Malone without face tats
I LOVE LIZZE AND DAN SM! <3
ahhhhh i love lizzie so much
It's really weird listening to Adam talk because my older brother talks exactly like him lol. He did consume, like, all of adams content and got me into the sky army, so it makes sense.
OOOOH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
I thought stampy and many more were gonna show up :,) they were the other ogs
The “yea I remember that” and the sad look bro
omg ldshadowlady is my childhood
Bro I love Adam. He just didnt give a fuck about anything and I found that so entertaining
What about Stampy?
Getting this on my recommendation? That’s rare
try to get technoblade of here i just think it would be funny
But... where is stampy?
15:35 Tommyinnit, Ranboo, and Knee Ha Chew
What about popularmmos :(
I thought that Stampy was gonna be here🥲
Sky fell off so hard even though he was one of the best
Imagine if stampy was here
Nice clikbat
Me, seeing Sky again for the first time in years:  "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you."
Stampy was also an OG
you should do a vid with moist kr1tikal
I hope Adam and his son are doing well
Yes, the reall OGS ❤
i saw ldshadowlady and clicked
You should do a part 2 but with stampylonghead, Iballisticsquid, and some one else. Hope you see this :)
I feel like youtube was easier back then but also not, like back then, videos were just recordings for fun, not much heavy editing and scripts, just you being you, tho nowadays, it’s much more normalized to be a YouTube but now to be a good content creator, you need jumpcuts, editing or something advanced instead of just recording for fun
It feels weird watching Adam have this whole chaotic energy after watching a video on his issues and how TeamCrafted got disbanded.  Good for him.
Me, seeing Sky again for the first time in i think 3 years   "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you."
Please please please please make a part 2 with Stampy
They must hate  minecraft soooo much
Okay but like where was stampylongnose
Skydoesminecraft is my YouTube hero, next to Pewdiepie.
Next video: Spending a day with the old smosh characters 😳
Dude all my childhood RIGHT HERE
MY CHILDHOOD
I literally miss Adam so much omg
I thought Adam gonna talk about butter for 20 minute
I saw Adam’s gamertag and clicked fast, big inspiration and idol.
I’ve watched Dan since the mod vids, he is the person that I will never stop enjoying 👍🏻💯
wheres stampy
oh yeah WELL I PLAYED 8 years ago... i need a life
I think it would be really entertaining to see you have a one on one conversation with Bo Burnham, especially with his new special
sometimes I blame gen z being the way we are on skydoesminecraft and honestly.... am I wrong...
I haven’t seen Adam in like years damn, used to watch his blogs but still sorta listen to his music
Dan always been fine😩
i’ve watched lizzie almost my entire life and i’ve never stopped. i love her content so much <3
can you spend a day with amy lee
I watched all three of them. Adam was my absolute hero, he was the one who always made me laugh  I also love how Adam is still his goofy self not taking everything so serious and just trying to make life funny and enjoyable. It made me feel like i was back in 2015.
Adam and team crafted literally raised me since I was 7 and it’s really surreal to see Adam now I’m glad to see after everything he’s doing good 🥺💗
Where’s Preston at? Minecraft is a fun enjoyable game to be honest. Aww man such great memories :D
adam was one of the first introductions i had to Minecraft and he fostered a love for the game, I'm so happy he's gotten to a better place because he really is a legend.
How can their be 50 billion views if there is only 7 billion people on earth??  Clickbait….
I honestly miss the old days of YouTube watching videos of Minecraft and not worrying about life
omg, nostalgia be hitting
Adam is literally just as funny as he was when he left Minecraft, it's amazing.
this video is literally my childhood
dan <3
Does anyone know if Adam is getting back together again with team crafted?
Dan raised me😌
Sky is my childhood, glad to see him again so energetic 🤣
Am i the only one that never bothered watching LD Dan and sky are the true mvps, also the fact that zack is mentioned makes my day. Hes such a fun guy to watch, he deserves way more views.
u should do a second part to this cuz there is a loottt of different youtubers that I lived when I was lil!!! for example: stampylongnose and iballisticsquid
My childhood in one video
WAIT SKY LIVED WITH POST MALONE WTFFFF
Dang, no stampy?
ihascupquake shaped me into the person i am today and I still admire her to this day
I hate that SkyDoesMinecraft and DanTDM are considered OG Minecrafters. They didn't really get popular until Minecraft was the biggest game in the world already.  You should have brought on Simon and Lewis from The Yogscast.
The fact that this video won’t get enough views past the dream interview is just sad
adam was my whole childhood, i love this so much
I couldnt stop smiling as i was watching this video, god i love these guys so much
Did ShadowCraft shape anyone else's childhood?
I love how Dan and Lizzie are peaceful then we have Adam who is pure chaos
I saw lizzie’s Minecraft skin on the thumbnail and Immediately clicked
Sky is my childhood man.. if i was givin 1M$ to rewatch all his videos, id do it for free
A L B E RT             -SkyDoesMinecraft, 2021
Minecraft’s Golden Age
Jokes on Lizzie I literally never stopped watching her videos.
It’s good to see Adam enjoying the interview. I hope he’s having a good life.
"Courgette" "That sounds like a sexy car, or a french woman" Corvette: *sexy whistle*
We need captainsparkelz, stampcat and popularmmos in this vid
Popularmmos please ❤️
I’m very grateful for Dan. He helped me through my parent’s divorce a couple years back, and I wouldn’t be the same without him.
I want him to do one with just sky. Cause I feel like it will truly show more of Sky's colors and understand more of him. He's an amazing content creator and was fan ever since his mods reviews. It would be an amazing video
Me, seeing Sky again for the first time in years:  "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you."
I spent with SMOSH now.
Part 2 with jeromeasf
BEST EPISODE
Adam was my childhood 🥲
Now I really want to see a day with ppl from Hermitcraft
I thought captain sparklez would be in this episode ;(
Next song from Adam is gonna feature Post Malone.
Where is stampy???????
as much as i love the newer mcyts, the og mcyts will always have a special place in my heart <3
Should have gotten Stampy
He should do doom players he interviewed. And it's such a shame what happened to team crafted but each person had a sketchy side.
Bro skies mc song was so fireer
the nostalgia is unreal. i loved watching sky’s try not to laugh videos, they never failed to make me laugh.
7:29 holy man, this scene alone gave me a different feeling. I'm being serious when I say this, I would do ANYTHING to go back
Woah, I guess not all Minecraft Youtubers are rapists
Sky > Dream
I like how Dan didn't want to swear on camera
Aphmau next pls
ldshadowlady 😭😭😭
they were all my childhood especially lizzie. she has been my favorite youtuber for eight years and im grateful that she was ever apart of my life, even if it was just through a screen
just missing stampy :/
I actually watched Sky play Epic Jump Map stuff on Minecraft with his friends Minecraft Universe and Deadlox.
"at the tip of my tongue at the back of my lungs" lmao
I Cant bilieve Stampy aint here i bet people born in 02 and 06 this is prob a childhood Minecrafter
wheres stampy ☹️
Better than the new stan general minecrafters
Lizzie!
Where in the shadow realm is trayuraus, i need to ask
this was so sweet to see
broooooooooooooo stampy shouldve been on here
or even all of team crafted
bro popularmmos shouldve been on here
WHERE IS STAMPY
No Grian or Mumbo Jumbo :O
I had the dumbest smile on my face just seeing Adam and Dan again, the nostalgia
I love Lizzie!
DUDE I NO JOKE WAS JUST THINK ABOUT HOW COOL IT WOULD BE IF ANOTHANY INTERVIEWED SKY DOES MINECRAFT!!!!!!
AN INTERVIEW WITH JAIDEN OOOOO BABY
Gotta miss the good old days... Rest In Peace teamcraft
sky DEFINITELY inspired the new roleplay based content; i doubt dream wasn't looking at what sky did in 2015-2018
YESS LDSHADOWLADY HAD TO BE IN HERE
Wait so trayaurus didn't actually talk?
this made me genuinely so happy
I watched Minecraft videos constantly has a kid but never in my life have I have heard of that chick
When stampy isn't here
1:45 I've literally heard songs from him
Ldshadowlady my beloved
Skydoesminecraft? I haven't heard that name in years...forever a Butter lover
Seeing adam in here remind me of my childhood memories. Team crafted and all that stuff
brooooo i used to watch adam all the time and seeing his humor be the exact same 10 years later is fucking hilarious😭😭😭 he reminds me of me and my brothers just that dumb humor from like early cartoon network or spongebob, idk how to explain it
Anybody else’s hear Twenty One Pilots Stressed out throughout this video.
i forgot all bout zackscott😭
At -6,56 Anthony sound like he’s in the pitch meetings series
dantdm was my childhood
ive been watching ldshadowlady for like 7 years. i honestly love how she has this recipe for her videos. i like watching her new content thats similar to her old ones, making me feel like a kid again.  edit: i feel like i should mention that i started watching her around grade 3-4 and now im gonna be a senior in a few months. still love her content :DD
Lizzie is literally the first youtuber I subscribed to after searching "minecraft" the memories 😭❣️
stop it i’m going to start sobbing at adam, the fact that I’m back in my minecraft era after a decade is insane. he was the first youtuber i watched consistently !!
Our Dad and Mom on YT who raised us
Bro where Stampy he’s the real OG SMH
Anthony can I please have your haircut it's really nice
I’m so glad Sky is doing ok.
Imagine Anthony having an interview with Ian that would blow up
ADAM YAY
WOO ADAM!!
This video is just nostalgia
Anthony please I'm begging you to do a "I Spent A Day" with age regressors!! they are different from the adult babies (Abdl and ddlg) you interviewed and I'd love to see some representation of my fellow regressors on here!! :)
This is the fastest I’ve clicked on a video- I mean it’s Minecraft
I would've loved to see stampy in here too
My Childhood Heroes
One criticism for Anthony, as much as I love these videos, is that sometimes it seems like for the sake of keeping up the pace, the conversations get chopped up. Sometimes it feels like we’re hearing only a sentence from an entire conversation him and the other person had, which sucks because I want to hear as much as the other person has to say to learn about them.
surprised captain sparklez isn't in here
Adam was my entire childhood lmao. Good to see him again!
Please do with Markiplier (oh hi)
MY CHILDHOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
I've been watching Lizzie since shadow craft and I still keep up with her videos. I don't understand how people stop. She's amazing and never fails to make me smile. Thanks, Lizzie! :)
man this type of stuff hits home for me especially with Dan, I remember him being the biggest part of most of my early internet years and he's grown amazingly
bro Antony how did u screw up niachu name lol
I watch few DanTDM stuff back then even though I watched more weirder gaming channels. Man Im happy you brought Lizzy here too! SHe's my favourite ever!
WHERE'S FAWDZ MAN WHAT THE HELL
Adam was definitely a big influence in my early childhood. He deserved none of what the snake did to him, but things change and I wont be upset over the offce all going their seperate ways, even if i miss it
Lizzie!!! 💕
I feel so nostalgic
God I fucking love Adam and his energy so much. He's so funny and he's insane in the best way I love him so much.
nostalgia damn
Wow I feel old I’m 24 🤣
Lizzie and Dan: *Shouting out channels* Adam: "This is Albert"
we just need antvenom, bajancanadian, jerome, ihascupquake & captain sparkles man. my childhood would be complete.
I’ve been subscribed to LDshadowlady since the first ep of shadowcraft
sky was my wholeee childhood 😢🤍
Stampy?
I love Adam so much, I have so many good memory’s of him
This video was great, I really appreciate your content and I think you're amazing! The only thing I really really want are subtitles... I know its difficult but I'm hard of hearing and I struggle to watch the whole video due to this. If you could consider adding them, I'm sure this would be appreciated by so many more people other than me.
i love seeing that adam’s doing alright i speak for a lot of people when i say he practically raised me and seeing that he’s happier rn makes me feel really glad :)
I’m really happy Adam was in this. When I was a kid I loved all of his videos.
PLEASE DO I SPENT A DAY WITH MODERN SMOSH
Omg sky
Im happy to see Sky actually looking happy again for once
DANTDM!!!
LDShadowlady photobombed my photo with InTheLittleWood at minecon 2012
I miss Adam so much damn🥺 he’s still hilarious!
Anthony acting like he ain’t as og if not more than these legendary youtubers lol
SKYYYYYYYYY
You should do a 2nd one with stamplongnose
these youtubers honestly give me so much nostalgia, dan and lizzie especially(i didn’t watch sky as often) like many other people i definitely ended up growing up with these youtubers and i’m pretty sure dan was the first youtuber i ever watched i still enjoy watching their content and while yes it’s not exactly the same as it was previously i will never stop being a fan of them and support where they’re going when it comes to their careers i know many people get blinded by nostalgia and just say things like “man i wish they would go back to their old content it was so much better!” and i was one of those people but i started to realize that they don’t have to listen to us at all, if they make content their proud of that’s all that matters in my opinion and i wish them all nothing but the best of luck in the future
Wait nvm I know dan
Me only knowing skydoesminecraft
I'd love a second part to this with like stampy squid and captain sparkles
These people raised me 😭
Am i the only one who didnt know who skydoesmincraft was till this video 😀
This is just satire now
You should do a vid with plush channels
Was hoping to see at least one member from Hermitcraft in here but great video nonetheless!
Where is ssundee
The good old days
Ive been waiting for this so long. this is my childhood
My childhood was sponsored by these people
thanks for including lizzie, she was soooo huge and yet she always gets left out some how. Love herr!
I miss Adam so much :(((
Sky used to be the most subscribed Minecraft YouTube who remembers that?
man i miss Adam…  I miss team crafted, god I miss my childhood
Zucchini is a squash therefore a fruit.
We can't forget stampy
so excited to see your music, adam!!!
Seeing Adam happy makes me smile. I had been watching him since I was like 9. I’m 16 now. I really love getting an update on his life once in a while. Glad he’s enjoying life!
Dan was the first youtuber I've ever watched, it's nice to see him doing well =]
Hearing Adam’s voice again almost made me cry
I missed all of Adam's jokes. Really miss u.
I wish that Stampy was here tbh, I still watch him just n9ot as much, and without him I wouldnt be me. I wouldnt be myself, I wouldnt even play Minecraft, maybe even not watch yt. might not have even have gotten the osc in my reccomended. thank you Stampy and Dan.
god this video shot me in the heart (/positive)  I grew up with all three of these people and they 100% made me the person i am today and i would NEVER change that for anything :]
LMAO i remember how it took me a so many months to realize that the squid was adam’s voice and not another person.
This guys hair is hilarious wtf even is it. Comb over perm 🤣🤣🤣 whatever you do you i guess man
Its so good to see them again, they made me love video games and raised me when my mom couldnt
I love you Anthony. I love your videos I miss you
Dan is my dad since I don't have one and plus he entertained me for 7 years rip Trayaurus
DUDE I LOVED LDSHADOWLADY AO MUCH SHE WAS MY FAVORITE edit: lizzie is still watch your videos just not as often aaaaa
sky is starting to look like post malone
I was a skydoesminecraft kid. All I watched was his content. It was tobuscus then him, and only him until I stopped watching Minecraft content. I'm back at it Minecraft again though
AAAAHHHH MY CHILDHOOD 😭😭😭😭
What about captain sparkles
You should do one with OG roleplay minecrafters (Aphmau, SamGladiator, ItsFunneh)
Botanically speaking, "courgettes" are berries.
lizzie is my childhood
butter.
A little sad Captain Sparklez and Yogcast/Blue Xephos aren't here. But if only 3 could be chosen, probably the best three to choose.
Do a part 2 with stampy!
god fuck get rid of the static in the intro and outro its so terrible
even to this day i still enjoy dantdm and adam so much, they're both great people :D
as much as I adore the new mcyt, no one can replace the og mcyt
i feel like sky got high at the end there
When Dan said "shoutout to Dr.Trayaurus" I was like:  *Holy shit he actually acknowledged his existence*
Where’s Stampy?
Im addicted with lizzies vids
ADAM!! MY CHILDHOOD HERO
STAMPY!!!!!!
AHHHHHH MY CHILDHOOD PLEASE I STILL GO BACK AND WATCH THE OLD COPS ANS ROBBERS VIDEOS
Dan helped teach me English
adam seems like hes doing so good these days :D
Stampy, squashy, carflo, and aphmau were also great. All of these people made my childhood.
This video gave so much nostaglia. God i miss those days. 😔🤲❤️.
adam evolved in such an interesting way, you can tell he's been through alot but he seems genuinely very enthusiastic about his music and im glad! he was my first ever youtuber i watched, it's been a wacky ride and now the new generation has modern day mcyt's as well :]
can we get a part 2 of this with more minecraft legends like ssundee, aphmau, lilshortysgs, etc.
its fucking albert
Yall still remember stampylonghead?
I was so excited to see Sky, he became part of my amazing childhood and made me get into minecraft more then until I just stopped watching and knew about months ago on what happened to Sky for these past years, I feel bad for myself as an old fan.  I am happy that Sky is alright now and doing what he likes, I wish him the best.
To sum up the intro mincraft boomers and that was my childhood
THE BIGGEST CHILDHOOD STARS
Sky is, for sure, in a different universe
where poularmmos
Didn’t Adam have a controversy that was quite 👀bad👀?
ah yes the three people who made up my childhood its just ✨amazing✨
Does anybody remember stampy cat?
no cause a lot of people move on and let go of their Minecraft phase but when I tell you as I’m rewatching lizzies videos THIS SHIT IS REAL
i’m so excited for jaiden
Lizzieeee <3
That intro of falling through the ceiling always makes me giggle.
That’s crazy you didn’t put ssundee in this
Everyone is talking about Adam but nobody remembers theorionsound (aka oli) even though he was actually the guy who owned the panda in crazycraft and also started the team oli vs team see pee kay war
Stampy and popularmmos are in my heart
Let the past be the past. If you try to bring it back it'll only make things worse
Lizzie just wants to do minecraft IRL
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Impossible to call if *legendary OG Minecrafters* if there’s no Stampy.

Sky got me through the toughest moment of my life and he made my childhood amazing, I keep going back to his epic jump map series and Im glad he seems to be doing better
All these people literally sculpted my childhood. I'm so glad Dan was able to lessen his burnouts and continue, Adam looking genuinely really happy and well, and Lizzie not changing her "recipe". It's what keeps me coming back to her <3
What about stampy!
Wait is that a billy poster in the background??
I would love it if you talked to jacksepticeye!!!
Ayo you should have added pats he was the second biggest Minecraft YouTuber
i miss drtrayoures
one day I'll be on this show 😼
I’m glad I can still enjoy Lizzies content, she’s right. the formula works
mans shoulda got miss aphmauuuu
I'm upset that he didn't feature Stampy...
And now time for everyone to ask for a part 2 where he talks to more OG Minecraft YouTubers like CaptainSparklez, AntVenom, SSundee, and more
Please do a part two!! 😭😭
Omg I love this
I LOVE LDShadowLady! Very random...
Man I saw Sky..I was so hype
Hey Anthony you should do a video with bowl cut guy Ian Hecox
YAY I MISSED THEM
Childhood complete
I’m glad sky looks so happy now
New Minecraft YouTubers got nothing on any old ones
stampy?
DanTDM used to be known as Dan from The Diamond Minecart
I might go back and watch some of Sky’s old videos because of the nostalgia highkey
Jordanian Maroooon? (CaptainSparklez)
I just love Lizzie's "recipe" when making her videos, I'm glad she doesn't change it because I'm so familiar with it and it's how I love her videos
Really no Captain Sparkles?
I remember the days when Dan was playing with mods while spending time with a White coated villager and a skeleton doggo
“I was just living with the rest of Team Craft… and Post Malone”
Technoblade soon?
We got to see post-Malone and sky got to see pre-molone
Once again, Antvenom is forgotton
LDSHADOW LADY WAS MY CHILDHOOD SHE WAS THE MINECRAFTER FOR THE GIRLS AND GAYS
All of these people are my childhood but I just wish Stampy was here lol
Woah adam looks like pre malone
When he said Ni-ha-chu I went 0_0 . . . Its Nihachu
Random suggestion, science YouTubers! Would be interesting to see how this radically different content from the majority of the mainstream can still get substantial views, their start as YouTubers and as people science in general. Examples could maybe be: Explosions&Fire, NileRed, ChemicalForce, but maybe also someone like Doctor Mike or someone from a different field.
Oh man, good ol' times
where is stampycat or ssundee
CAN YOU PLAEASE DO A VIDEO WITH GENDERFLUID PEOPLE :O
🤍
Better title: I spent a day with youtubers who built childhoods.
Sky is still the best ngl
Dan : I went all around the world!  Me living in Canada: oh hehe...
do "i spent a day with polyglots"!!!
Alr come on ppl this man dan made our childhood his
OG Minecraft YouTubers are better than today's ngl
Please god if you’re real make Anthony go back to Smosh
sky 🥺
it's sad how a new generation is growing up with new gen minecraft youtubers like dream, and everyone.  they'd never hear of stampy, balisticsquid, dantdm, sky, syndicateproject, captainsparklez, etc. it's sad that they have never heard of 2014 - 2015 minecraft parodies, instead they're listening to minecraft p*rn.
ALBERT
Club Ice all the way BB😏😏
childhood has entered the chat
Yooooooo this video is pog!   Plus I’m so exited for when you’ll spend a day with enbies because I’m an enby   Also Jaiden is really pog so I’m exited for that too  Keep doing what you do Anthony!
wait but gamer chad...
Only OG's know what we called Gold Butter
SkyDoesMinecraft…  Still a very chaotic person to this day
This is singlehandedly everyones childhood summarised in one video.
Dan was a big part of my childhood. I remember seeing his mod videos and realizing how much potential there is in Minecraft. I even made myself a little copy of his lab and I even got myself a Dr. Treyaurus. Although I stopped watching him back then, I still have all the happy memories and all the iconic videos. I wouldn't be who I am without his videos :)
sad anthony doesn't interview Stampylonghead T_T
SSUNDEE
4:17 all rise for our national anthem!!!
3 months :D am excited :DD
bruh.
NiHA-Chu?
they used the team crafted animation for skydoesminecraft :o
I didnt really watch sky and LD for me it was dantdm, popularmmos, stampy
Ay where PopularMMOs
How tf does Adam make money now?? Like how is he not broke yet
i used to watch them a lot back in the day <3
Lizzie and Sky practically raised me
you need to add popularmmos
It's crazy how shadowlady and Dan still pull big views
Thank u for not putting Dream or Tommyinnet on here
Albert
Video Idea: I spent a day with VLOGER'S
Sky and Dan were integral parts of my childhood
Do another part with Stampy, Popularmmos etc. plzzz
Yeah Music -Adam Dahlberg, 2021
<3
Where was Stampy
Do a 2nd part with popularmmos and stampy. Ppl would love that
I'm kinda sad to not see JeromeASF on this...
This is inspiring :0 As aiming to be a part-time minecraft YouTube this has given me some tips on starting :D
Do a part 2 to this, Stampylonghead, iballisticsquid, PopularMMOs (those are just suggestions for who I would want to see)
seeing the man who basically raised so many of us & contributed to our lives in a special way after so long makes me feel some typa way :,]
i missed Adam so much, it’s so great to see him again. he still makes me laugh as much as he did all those years ago
It’s crazy because Dan got me into Minecraft around 2015
i miss team crafted. Sky, Jerome, Bajan, Ssundee...just to name my favorites :(
Dan made my childhood
Hi Albert
I still love Adam😭 he's so funny   He's built my childhood memories
Team crafted, stampy and squid, danTDM, pat and Jen, Captain sparkles, yogcast, truly the best of the best Minecrafters I’ve ever seen
wow my childhood
I’m so happy to see Sky (Adam). Really, I feel so much euphoria hearing him talk again. I watched him right around the time I realized I was being abused (because I was no longer a stupid little kid so I knew it wasn’t normal), he was probably one of the only people giving me happiness during that time. I would come home from school and be so excited to watch his videos, it’s all I thought about all day and what kept me going. Seriously I don’t think I could ever express my thankfulness for him, I feel like I owe so much to him for giving me a little bit of a childhood. If I ever met him I think I would probably cry just because of how much he impacted me lol. He’s an incredible human, I’m so happy to see him doing well
pls do next i spent a day with the greatest player in among us
Anthony from smosh, sky does Minecraft and DanTDM, THE MOST NOSTALGIC VIDEO EVER KNOWN TO MAN KIIIIND
LDSHADOWLADY I LOVE HERR
Where is popularmmos(pat) ;-;    read more
These 3 are so incredibly nostalgic for me, I'm almost 18 now but was completely OBSESSED with them 7 years ago, I wish them all the best <33
CRAZY CRAFT WALKED SO THAT THE DREAM SMP COULD RUN
LIZZIE MY BELOVED ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who else was today years old when they found out that Dan wasn’t using a mod or anything like that while talking with Trayaurus? Because wow that took me years
THIS IS ALBERT Adam had me cackling throughout that entire video
Anthony looks cool but his style makes him a LITTLE TINY gay
Where’s popularmmos
I practically owe majority of my happiness to Dan as lile 5-8 year old AT LEAST I’ll never stop supporting Dan
would have loved Captainsparklez here too, or any of the Mianite/Trinity Island people.. nevertheless fun video :)
Digging a hole
WAIT , I NEED A POPULARMMOS AND GAMING WITH JEN IN THE OG MINECRAFTERS. THEY WE'RE MY FIRST PARENT'S IN MCYT  ( My parent's in mcyt is now Dadza and mumza )
i'm a simple gal. i see lizzie, i click.
That bmh reference
ALBERT
Ok but Dan was literally my childhood I watched like all his og videos as a kid. Also my brother is called Daniel
THE HIDE AND SEEK AND TRY NOT TO LAUGH WITH SKY, APHMAU, ROSS, AND MORE WAS SO FUN AND I FREAKIN MISS THOSE DAYS
Am I the only one expected Philza to be here. Since he's the oldest and the Founder of Minecraft. Lol
Now all we need is tobuscus to be on an episode
I'm simple. I see lizzie i click
If there is a part 2 I need ihascupquake in it haha
Since you've done Dream SMP and OG Minecrafters, why not Hermits (members of the Hermitcraft SMP)? Asides from PewDiePie and several animation, music, and gameplay channels, Hermitcraft and the Dream SMP were the two servers that _really_ revived Minecraft on YouTube and brought it into the highlight in Twitch. ^w^
I’ve been watching ldshadowlady for years and till this day she still puts out the same content, its soo refreshing and nostalgic ❤️
Dantdm is my childhood favourite youtuber
i used to watch sky's butter parkour videos! what a throwback
It warms my heart to see Adam look so comfortable and happy 🥲. One of my childhood heroes
Man, legend meet legends😂😂😂 this is might be a best crossover I've ever seen
Spend a day with the og smosh crew
no stampy,,
Shadowlady!!!
Would you have talked to popularmmos if what ever is happening to them
Hey maybe one day you should make a video with OG YouTubers like Tomska, eddsworld and others
Zackscott got in the video
It would of been better if he got Stampy and PopularMMOS in
YALL FORGOT STAMPY !!!!
Back when dan use to swear.
Alternative Title: Anthony spends a day with everyones childhood
Stamps Popularmmos Stampy Popularmmo Stampy
My childhood in a single video
Did anyone else notice that he spelt trayaurus wrong? 😉
MinecraftUniverse :(
I remember being sick when i was at middle school and I literally watched all 75 episodes of Lizzie's minecraft series in like 4 days. She made my childhood so much more fun and made me realise that girls can also enjoy games. Although I moved on from her content, I still hold these memories dear to my heart and i will never forget it. :))
Bro Dan has child and a wife!! Holy shit where have I been
ive been watching ldshadowlady since the first shadowcraft began i feel old
Netnobody personality neverr changedd and i love it.
i had a bit of hope we might get to see ethoslab, but he doesnt show his face so...
Dantdm was the first mc youtuber I ever watched. I remember my older sister came up to me and showed me the Harry Potter floo powder mod showcase, and I watched that video so many times and I’m sure I’ll watch it many times in the future
Stampycat?
Make a part 2 with stampylonghead iballisticsquid and maybe aphmau
I’ve missed Adam- he was a majority of my lasting memories from being a kid. (I have memory issues, and even though I’m only 15 I don’t remember most things from my past, even memorable things from 12 aren’t there) Sky’s videos have always had their place in my mind and seeing those clips that I know so well made me smile. I’m glad he seems to be doing well
Love how Anthony is trying to make a Minecraft video so serious...😂
Anyone else remember when KSI destroyed SkyDoesMinecraft? No? Well pepperidge farm remembers.
OMG THE NOSTALGIA THANK YOU
Ssundee😭
So excited for the Non binary video! love my fellow enbies! <3
Just came for Lizzie!!
If you ever did a part 2, would love to see Stampy/Squid on the next one!
Sky is my easily in my top 3 favorite YouTubers. I watched him back in 2013-2017 when he quit making Minecraft videos and began doing music. I had no problem with him doing music, if he said it was his new passion, but the time he stopped doing it was when I stopped watching him as often as I did. I watched and listened to some of his music of course, but it wasn't the same. It's cool that he's back to doing minecraft videos though.  I loved Adam for his personality in his videos. Almost everytime he laughed, I laughed, the guy had a hilarious laugh. I started calling Gold "Budder" because of him. I even made a Budder house in my main Minecraft world after he left such a great legacy in my late childhood. Adam was a bit of my motivation to want to become a YouTuber, until 2016 when the platform started enforcing new community guidelines, but that's besides the point.  Adam, I may not have been apart of your crew, and I feel sorry for the entire $#!t storm you've been through, but It would've been an honor to meet you, and become a friend of yours.
Damnit I realized I used to like cringe things
Adam has literally been one of my inspirations this past decade or so and it made me really glad to hear a conversation with Anthony :D
lmfao skye watching this realizing he doesnt match with the others
Im gonna SOB
loved this vid but imagine if stampylonghead was featured. like that dude was my childhood.
God Adam seems like he hasn’t changed whatsoever, hope he’s doing well in his personal life
I feel as if we need a part 2, 3, 4, etc, there are soooo many OG Minecrafters, I would love to hear their perspectives too, please..
A dantdm minecraft fnaf video was the 1st yt vid I ever watched. All 3 of those I still like today
Do a video with people from smosh
Dan was the first youtuber I ever watched
I love how sky still has his sense of humour
why am I sobbing
20:59 a l b e r t
I’ve been playing MC since 2011 and I never watched any of these people
I’m a simple person, I see dantdm, I click
ngl came for my girl lizzie
Ayo, shout-out to Albert!
Sadly stampy wasn’t on here
The nostalgia of watching this old Minecraft yt...I remember mainly watch these two's youtube
LIZZIE 😩<333
sky’s on crack lul
Spent a day with bella porch
Where's Captainsparkelz? He's more legendary than them
Anthony you should interview more OG Youtubers Like Rageelixir,Bajancanadian and ssundee
Dan is the most subed mc youtuber but i think dream will take the spot soon
I couldn’t stop smiling but i wish you got stampy too
The beginning of a beautiful era.
LIZZIE OMG
Imagine if he got Stampy on the video as well, that would've been cool
Ahhh the nostalgia oh wait I still watch them never mind
Seeing skydoesminecraft just makes me remember the beef between him and KSI   And btw a video where Anthony meets englands best biggest youtubers like KSI and others would be nice
I’m upset stampy wasn’t in this
Idea: I spent a day with femboys
do i spent the day with bo burham🙌🙌
I’m so sad Stampylonghead wasn’t in this! I used to wait everyday for his videos to be posted, I remember crying when his channel got deleted for like a day.
YEAH MUSIC -Icon Adam
LDSHADOWLADY is the Best!!
Albert
The nostalgia hits me like a Chinese tank in the non existent Tiananmen Square of June 5 1989 Edit: and Sky decided to turn that Nostalgia into hate...
DanTDM doesn't get enough credit for his Minecraft domination these days in my opinion
dont like adam cause the ross and max drama 🥵
WHERE IS STAMPY
Mabye I spend a day with HermitCrafters? Because it such a big community.
Halfway through the video and I’m PRAYING he asks someone “do you think pewdiepie brought back Minecraft?”
AHHHH DAN DAN DAN edit: sorry I did a fanboy moment
Good to see Sky smile so much again
21:04 🤦🏻‍♂️  It is spelled “T R A Y A U R U S” NOT “T R E Y A U R U S”  Good video though
I am Simple Man  I See DanTDM, I Click
Ssundee is more og than all of the minecraft youtubers
So anyone else just broke down crying hearing Adam's voice? No just me? Ok-
THEY ARE always going to be better then the dream smp and other dream members
Man. I wish Stampy was on here. He's OG 4 me 2.
Yess Dan the goat
JeromeASF
Seeing Adam so happy makes me so happy after his drama alert interview
**cries in nostalgia**
Can you please make another one but with pat and or Jen?
where is popular mmos
Please make a part 2 with three more OG Minecraft YouTubers
I feel like “I spent a day with meth addicts” might be around the corner - but for science.
18:01 Adam: "ye"  Damn I missed that!
I can't wait for the Nonbinary episode, I've been needing a good window into that community. You always get some cool people to interview.
its nice to see the og's every once in a while
I went to one of those DanTDM tours! Basically an old friend, we both watched dantdm TONS at the time, invited me and yeah, that happened.
Maybe it's the weed talking, but you should interview ghost hunters. That would be awesome.
watching for lizzie <3
Awe sky was my childhood 🥺🥺
adam omg
I have no memories with sky other then story mode- ... sorry- ...BUT DAN!!! LIZZIE!!!! TuT don’t watch Dan anymore but I still watch lizzie she’s amazing!! Just remembered sky weren’t in MCSM that was captain sparkles XD take it back I have no nostalgia over him at all
Damn seeing them and talking about minecraft a few years ago makes me feel old... deym im really old...
I love how sky’s personality is the same
What about popularmmos?
dude the skydoesminecraft hide and seek videos with Aph, Ross, Barney, and Jin (fuck you jin) were the best
*Sad PopularMMOS Noises*
I honestly love how Dan and Lizzie were chill and then Adam/Sky was just crazy.
This... This is the video I have been waiting for.
You should do one with smosh for good old times
You should spend a day with Stampy, that would be amazing
Ldshadowlady was my inspiration growing up
What about Popularmmos??
Can’t wait for part 2 in about 5 years
I have always loved ldshadowlady she was the FIRST ever youtuber i watched :) still watch her vids
The roof is crying
I went to the TeamCrafted meetup. It was kinda cursed because half the team quit like before the day of the event LOL
i love how chaotic sky is:]
dang i’m surprised they didn’t show dantdm’s villager roommate
please make a video with technoblade .
i see ldshadowlady, i click!
This is so cool bro
Hermitcraft/ Scicraft interview please-
Hi DAN :D
Skydoesminecraft matro-maned himself
I’m sorry, everyone here is an OG, but where’s PopularMMOS???
You could try to get a few members of hermitcraft they have been playing for a long time on the same server just in different seasons
I remember watching skys videos daily😭😭
He forgot about CaptainSparklez! CaptainSparklez is the first YouTuber to play minecraft on the platform!
you should do gender fluid people!
Anthony out here acting like he wasn't the most subscribed channel on youtube and one of the first on the platform period.
I just miss sky making Minecarft video when I'm bored I just go to his Minecarft and see all the old video that he do but now when he say he going to stop I almost cry because I love the video he do with all his friends maybe one day he will make Minecarft video again idk if well happened
LIZZIE <33
Alternate Title: Anthony talks to our internet parents
Lizzie quite literally raised me when my parents didn't and seeing her thriving makes my heart si happy <3
Ldshadowlady was the first person i ever subbed to, i love that woman she taught me everything I know
HERE BEFORE VIRAL
Adam along with stampy are the two minecraft youtubers who never changed. You could say that led to the death of their careers. But I'm kinda glad they didn't evolve like DanTDM who now appeals to the "new" minecraft community.
This was so wholesome ❤️
Hey... Sky is saying he can reach 5 billion views with his music, now that's really exciting. BANGER MUSIC LETS GOOO  Edit: That was Albert
WHERE IS STAMPY!!?!?!
he should do “a day with og twitch streamers” and invite karl jacobs :)
i love adam he is so fucking funny
Theme Suggestion! Spending that day with child stars.(Bratayley, EvanTubeHD, etc.)
Lol Dream wasn't called for this since he's a cheater
i love lizzie so much i’ve grown up watching her
TDM was like the only bonding I had with my brother. Geez I didn't think 10yrs had passed in his career
One of my favorite older YouTubers that mainly did Minecraft was Tobuscus. Sad to see where he is now and I wish he could have been in this video.
I would love to see Lizzie and Nihachu go on the dsmp and have a villain arc
Dantdm yaaaaa
the celieng tho  where's the anthrapomorphic pig?
Finally,some good fucking food
legendary OG youtuber interviews legendary OG youtubers 😭
So fun to watch! I'd love to see a part 2 if you can!
I would love you to see with some hermits and sci craft member
and yet, lizzie is still just as stunning and hilarious
Who made Lizzie sign a zucchini
is there any reason that popularmmos isnt in this? not a hate comment at all I just wanna know
PLS SKY DOES MINECRAFT IS LITERALLY ON COCAINE LMAO
Great video 👍
Sky was such an incredible influence on the early part of my childhood and he had a heavy influence on my sense of comedy.
it's so weird how certain channels reach certain people because I watched Sky up until he stopped and I still watch Lizzie, but I've never heard of Dan until this video
hELLLLL YEA
WHO LIEK MINECRAFFFFFF
ni ha chu he says       Its Nihachu or niki
anthony always spends time with people.. but who is going to spend time with him?
I literally love these people🥺 i still go back and watch all their old videos
i’m convinced adam was high during the interview 😂
LETS GOOOO LDSHADOWLADY FR FR?!?!?
This reminds me of the time dunkey beat sky at smash
How 25 billion view when only about 7 billion people
how about ssundee ? crainer? or even captain sparkles?
ive missed adam so much. he’s been such a big part of my life for so long. i’m so glad so see him happy :’D
i miss skydoesminecraft and the old gang :/ not that i would want them to come back just for us but just the time :/ i watched him when i was 13 and now im 20
Catastrophic events happening worldwide. Haggai chapter 2 verses 6-9 Luke chapter 21. The TRUTH of the scriptures are being fulfilled right before our eyes. " All who call on the name of the LORD will be saved " JESUS CHRIST is the LORD. " There is no other name under heaven by which mankind can be saved " " Call unto me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of " Start calling
I've always like SkyDoesMinecraft cause when I was a kid, he very much reminded me of my oldest brother, so he was big brother minecraft and friends to me XD I watched him all the way till his last minecraft video, and sometimes I check out his channel to see if he has new music videos, just for fun :p
I need a "Spending a day with OG Roblox YouTuber's"٩😌۶  plzz
U TBE shad*w bands people
Do an interview with Ian
Can we just talk how STUNNING LIZZIE looks!!🤍 SHE A QUEEN!!
God I miss Adam
I missed seeing skydoesminecraft, thank you for doing this
I love lizzie so much
Dan is literally my childhood I am 11 now so I am not joking
I knew this was coming
My mans didn't get stamps squid or ash :/
OH MY GOD I REMEMBER BACON MAN… I miss adam sm
Can't believe CaptainSparkles wasn't in this vid 😭
We need Captainsparklez. He is one of the OG's.
Sky does Minecraft shaped a huge chunk of my childhood. Hearing the first episode of his Minecraft lets play got me almost emotional. Its crazy how much changes in what feels like so little. Making him fan art and actually having him liking it on instagram was one of the actual best moments of my younger years 😭😭
I remember when I was 2nd grade I was so damn obsessed with DanTDM and BajanCanadian, and most kids my age were mostly listening to minecraft music parody videos, Take Back The Night was still a new minecraft song at the time, and it was a banger to most of us, and Bajan's hunger game song? We thought that song was the coolest thing ever, those were the days
God I was hoping you would have sky on
Where’s my boi Captainsparklez he’s the real Og
If sky did a podcast id pay top dollar
AYO MORE NET NOBODY MUSIC??
S-Sundee 😓
Adam was known as Sky for so long, he left a legacy. He’s not just a Minecraft OG, he’s one of the founding fathers of MCYT. Sky is still a father figure to me not matter what he does in life
Were is syndicate at?
i think sky is just high asf my guy
Sky will forever be the kind of person who always makes me laugh. My childhood was centered around this man :((
Im so mad about what the current minecraft era has become
WHERE IS SSUNDEE WHERE IS HE YOU FORGOT HIM
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DUDE. I’m a junior in college now but middle school these were my idols lol
Lizzie an Dan were very chill and Adam was just like *POST MALONE* and *AHHHHHHHH* he was a whole mood and i absolutely loved it.
i wanted captain sparkles my guy D:
Lol Dan’s kid is gonna be so proud of his dad when he starts playing mine craft. I can see him telling all his school friends that his dad is DanTDM
The fact that stampy , popularmmos or even jerome wasn’t in here is sad
Sky finally crawled out of his damn cave for this lmao
AYYYY YOU DID ONE WITH DAN
Am I the only one who never knew about ShadowLady until now? I used to think I knew all the og Minecraft YouTubers but I guess not lol
Its really sad to think about, but i had totally forgot about dantdm and skydoesminecraft. They were both a big part of my childhood and if they see this, thank you! You guys are the best
It bothers me that popular MMOs isn't here😢
Ahhhh! me and my brother used to watch SkyDoesMinecraft so long ago! Sky was one of the first people I subscribed too :')
SKY
Seeing Dan and sky it just reminds me of my childhood but it’s good to see them again 💛💛💛
What about your brother
These are the Minecraft youtubers we need, but we do not deserve.
Man, just thinking about when i started playing minecraft like 11 years ago. Back when boats used to break when you hit the edge of anything 🤣 and there were only pugs cows and sheep and chickens
would it be too much to ask for a part two?? Honestly, more than three wouldn't have fit in this video but there are still so many more! but of course it would be a hard sell to Anthony, just a thought! obviously loved this though 😂
I like the way the community questions are incorporated into the video.
You shoulda put Stampy 😔
PART 2???
The fact that these people where my childhood just awesome.
You should definitely invite Stampy next time!
Adam has never changed, and honestly I love that of him
I’ve been with Lizzie since the beginning 😌
My childhood memories suddenly band together into one when watching this and said, "Aight, time for some nostalgia."
Where's capatinsparkles?
Adam looks good, I heard that he has a daughter now
am i the only one that cried watching this
I remember when I was very little we didn't have wifi for a very long time but then I remember one day waking up and going to the computer and seeing internet connection . And the  first thing I did was go to YouTube and I still remember the videos I watched were of Sky, Stampy and Dan. They really raised me to become the person I am. ☺️
Where is Ssundee
Yo. Imagine if Anthony were to do a “I sat down with Ian Hecox.” And they talk about Smosh and they just reminisce. I would love that
YESSS LIZZIE
I would love an "I spent the day with Bilingual people" video
Omg Ldshadowlady and dantdm :0
seeing satampy would have been cool
MAN, Dan has over 18 BILLION channel views.
You guys made a major impact on so many of our lives ty so much og Minecraft yt's
this had dantdm and I got gassed
Yes yes but where is Stampy… I was expecting stampy
“Legends never die”
You need to do an part 2 with Popularmmos and Stampy.
Anthony do you miss smosh?
creeper aw man
i dont mean this as an insult but, man, they look old :''') idk it makes me tear up bc we're all getting older and we cant go back to the good ol days
popularmmos aka pat should be there!!!
No CaptainSparklez? I'm out
Anybody else was watching one of these people 5-6 years ago!
Aphmau, CaptainSparkles, and SSundee  NEED to be on here too. The nostalgia in this video almost made me cry.
Adam is on a completely different playing field. Liz and Dan are like nice and calm and normal, then Adam is just Adam. Can I make Adam an adjective? Cause Adam is Adam.
AWESOME
I wish popularmmos was here  (sorry if I spelt it wrong)
I still want a “I spent a day with hypochondriacs”
I’m surprised you didn’t get popularmmos
i remember watching sky's pizza halloween skit with post malone in it
I have so much respect for Lizzie for knowing what works for her videos and not letting others affect her. I honestly want to go and watch her again cause it’s been a while and I realize how much I miss watching people like her.
where is stampy
He should make an "I spent a day with Smosh" video
This is so crazy, it feels like all my worlds are colliding. DanTDM was my favourite youtuber for the longest time when i was a kid!
How dare you not have CaptainSparklez… the real OG
not a single comment about how sky doesnt do minecraft anymore instead its skydoes excorsisms
:D MY BUTTER BOI
It feels like 3 perspectives of different times in the career, LDShadowlady Is still in it and really into making her videos, DanTDM burnt out and has now established ground rules and seems like he enjoys making content, and Adam is retired and finding new ventures and seems very happy.
lizzie literally raised me better than my parents. thank you.
Do one that you do a day with smosh
Anthony should make a video of old mcyt and new mcyt in one video. I feel like that would be cool
no Yogscast?
Finally, minecraft youtubers I know of
Wait was the non-binary episode out or no- wait-
Yeah Dan was in MC story mode as well, and Stampy, Stacy, CaptinSparkles, and other MCYT’s, fave episode of MC story mode 😊
It would be amazing if you can do an interview with Stampy next! Love the videos btw!!!
Where was popularmmos and stampy
i look like an idiot smiling the whole video
0:56 long....Haired....SDM?!
I remember waking up In mornings before school, eat my breakfast while watching skydoesminecraft, such a simple time, what I wouldn’t give to experience that again for one more day, No one, Not dream, not Tommy, Not Techno, no one, will be able to top these OG revolutionary people.
Sky is dealing with a similar thing that filthy frank had to deal with when he became a music creator 😢
LIZZIE OMG YES YES OMG IM SCREAMING YES OMG I LOVE HER SO MUCH
Bacon man… a name i havent heard in years
Yooooo I can’t wait for the new music drops and I seriously want to see netnobody everywhere with that 5 bill view song hammer this shit out and don’t ever stop
you should interview smoosh, they were an important part of youtube history
Thinking about how 9 ish years ago i used to watch DanTDM and then seeing this is so nostalgic
You should have had Stampy on, I remember I used to love watching his lovely world videos
Shoutout something you only have 5 seconds   Lizzie and Dan: Fans   Sky: ALBERT
I spent a day with the sidemen would bang
a bunch of people always overlook ldshadowlady im so glad shes in this
L for not having CaptainSparklez
The fact that stampy wasn’t on here kinda disappoints me he was my childhood and many others. I think he should be called a legend as well
I like how Dan and Lizzie are like somewhat serious when talking, and then there just Adam just being his goofy self and I love it 🤣
Simon and Lewis from the Yogscast are my OG Minecrafters!! Shadow of Israphel anyone?
bring the old mc youtubers back they were way fucking better than these stupid kids now
I GOT A SECRET ITS ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE IN THE BACK OF MY LUNGS I GOTTA KEEP IT AND YOU DONT DUCKING KNOW
I wanted to see stampy and squid but these guys were also my entire childhood
the nostalgia it's crazy
Man, I love to see Sky happy again. He's a Minecraft legend honestly.
I remember when dan loved making Minecraft videos so much that he still played and made Minecraft videos with a broken wrist
ANTHONY, I LOVE YOU, BUT NEE HA CHOO??
You should have also had Stampy
YES
Anyone who used to play Minecraft from 2011-2014 knows how insanely popular Sky was. Man was like the OG Dream in terms of popularity back then.
8:01 Anthony: A sexy car or a French lady    Lizzie: but it a vegetable 😏  The way she said it 😆
Would love to see a Ludwig, and other modern streamers vs old streamers
We need stampy:D
God I miss the day that I would get home from elementary school and load up the new Skydoesminecraft video. I was distraught after he left YouTube. But I enjoy seeing Sky again, he helped me through so many hard times.
what about other games like fortnite or terraria
ok but you al remember stampy?
Dang.. Sky and Dan were my childhood.. Cops and robbers with Sky were so much fun to watch and I remember being so excited when Dan opened his vlogging channel. Brings back so many memories
you should do an interview to the first mc youtuber. paulsoaresjr.
sky was definitely high
Spend a day with smosh God damamnit
4 YouTube veterans in one video?  Yes please!
It’s Daaaaaannnnn
what about stampy?
Where's gaming with Jen gaming with  and popularMMOS
The best era of minecraft creators
bro i forgot Austin was post malone
Please do one of Samgladiator, he was a Really popular minecraft YouTube and still posts now.
i miss dr.treyaurus
Where ssundee
Was waiting to see popularmmos tbh :(
this albert
Dude I went to see Dan when he came to my city on his first tour with my friend a few years ago and it was so fun. I used to watch Dan like every day and I know this was in the video (what I’m saying) but I’m just remembering all of this stuff from so long ago even though I never really “forgot” his channel I just stopped watching it all of the time. Still though, this video brings back serious memories
I love adam so much, hes my hero
You should do a spending a day with cancelled influencers
Stampy and squid got me hooked on minecraft
I'm glad adams doing good last I saw him he was on keem star and all that stuff and I'm just glad he's doing better
Dan raised me😭✋
Dude, PopularMMos should have been in the video
Groovy video.
a l b e r t
This video is missing bajan and Jerome
stampy was my childhood
Pls the bring me the horizon reference during the sponsor
go back to smosh
I used to watch Dan all the time when I was younger. *I still watch Lizzie
Sky walked so dream could speedrun
Believe it or not, Ali-A is an Og minecrafter.
:(
i love that lizzie shouted out joel :)
DAN!! LIZZIE!!! SKY!!! OMG. 😭 I don't watch them anymore (Well I watch Dan once in a while) but I still love them 💕
Definitely needs a part 2 with the likes of yogscast and syndicate
wish stampy was on this
I was hopping popularmmos
Of all YouTubers, where is the legend himself Stampylonghead, Anyone?
Was Sky always this crazy? I was an og butter army member but holy shit I don’t know how I watched him now.
Sky was my literal childhood. He got me through rough times as a kid. He is and always was my inspiration.💛😎
I miss Sky 😢
When I was 12 I watched Sky after school everyday, holy crap
Interview Barrack Obama
I wonder if ld shadow lady remembers bea plays
Where's Captainsparklez?
Adam seemed like an excited child
I think you should interview people who were part of Minecraft SMPS's(people who came from Mindcrack, Hermitcraft, Dream SMP etc.) Mumbo Jumbo is someone who has been playing for many years and I think he is a good person to interview.
does anyone else remember zackscott and how good he use to be before he just did nintendo crap?
I was kind of hoping PopularMMOS would be here
Where 25.1 B??
Thanks for shouting me out
Wow
Always interesting to see some of the OGs talk about their start.  If you do another one like this, it’s be fun to see etho from ethoslab on. He’s been a big influence on some of the stuff in the game, like how red stone contraptions developed
Is lizzy wearing a wig?
I grew up with dantdm, fgteev, popularmmos and smosh
you should do a part 2 with stampy or iballisticsquid and ihascupquake amylee33
Would have been amazing if you got Stampy on or iBallisticsquid :))
adam stole the show
No mindcrackers ;(
Regret modernity: DreamSMP  EMBRACE TRADITION:
Its great to see sky again
Keep smashing it man! Love your channel! Miss the glory days too tho! Excited to see the Jaiden video!
Dantdm and Stampy Hold a special place in my heart, It brings back nostalgia of my elementary school life. Every time I listen to the classic theme By c14 I have a sense of relaxation and Nostalgia. Nostalgia Is my favorite feeling, it brings me back to when YouTube was Smaller and was just a platform for video uploading. every time I hear This platform as a industry I think of how far the internet has come. Thank you Dantdm, and stampy for giving me a excellent childhood.
Sky’s a chad
skydoesminecraft has actly made beef with ksi and made disstracks
Skythekidrs
Do hermitcraft peeps
bacon man is back!
lizzie!!!!!!!
Dude you should do OG Roblox players
Omg, my childhood youtubers🥺🤍🤍 I only watched Lizzie’s videos still!
Dan raised an entire generation.
Anthony needs to fix that hole in his ceiling
i remember sky being the guy i wanted to game with and have a wholesome time and now hes the guy i wanna smoke a joint with and cause chaos
OMG LIZZIEEEEE
WILL YOU EVER CALLAB WITH CORYXKENSHIN
These people inspire a generation
ALBERT
LDShadowlady is my idol- she once hearted my comment and i was crying cause i was so happy! ive been a fan of her for like 4 or 5 years now and whenever she uploads i click as fast as i can because her videos always make me so happy <3
These guys were amazing and definitely a part of my childhood! My favorite Minecraft player is definitely Ethoslab, he is just so wholesome and doesn’t care about fame, he is also the creator of so many red stone inventions so he definitely helped makes Minecraft a better game, he also has the longest running let’s play. He definitely one of the best minecrafters out there and if you say other wise you are dead to me.
I've followed Adam thru his who carrier and ill never stop but still I've been watching since 2011 bro i have a job now and stuff this is just wild
our kings and queens never left we just got older:(
mincecraft is my fucking childhood man!! 8 years already!
All my fav YouTubers all together ahhh
Popularmmos fans are crying rn
Sky was my minecraft dad. And then he became an actual dad
I’m so glad Lizzie was in this video
i like when anthony says “… or will they have ended up resenting the game” like the only person you can refer to with that is sky 😔
Remeber when stampy and Lizzie made a video together
you should totally do a video spending time with the members of hermitcraft! Maybe Zedaph, ZombieCleo, Grian or Xisuma!
Wish he got the primeval og creators such as the Yogscast.
Interview smosh
everytime lizzie posts i still watch her videos
Anyone else want to know more about what is fucking going on with sky and the demons. LIke Bro you good???
*who gave sky so much energy and where can I get it*
Bruh what if "I spent a day with smosh members" as an april fools video next year
..
gosh i missed sky so much
Ldshadowlady was my childhood!
I'm sorry I want elaboration on Skye doing exorcisms?
You should do an episode with Metalheads! 🤘🎸
please please please do apart 2 with Stampy in it i reallyyyy want to see what he has to say as well as myybe iballisticksquid
i love how when sky shows his dog he is also wearing a cat sweater
Before I get further into the video, I might sob
I learned so much English through Dan's videos when I was in 4-6th grade and that opened a whole new world to me. I seriously wouldn't be here right now without him.
Spend a day with exorcists- research it well and be real..
I wish there was a happy crying emoji
If Adam's music is any good, he can probably get the 5 bil views he wants :p. Many people still remember his for Minecraft and he knows Post Malone, which will definitely help
it would be cool if Anthony interviewed "OG" Roblox youtubers like Poke, Denis and Hyper would be pretty pog
ngl kinda dissapointed Stampy wasnt in here. he was the old dream
ALBERT IS A GOD. Love you Adam and I'm so glad you're doing better. I was there since like day 1 watching your vids and when you were starting to get tired and it was showing through I felt like the world was ending. As I am right at the point of becoming an actual adult now, I couldn't have asked for a better role model. You kept things real from the start and helped me realize that there's a lot to being a YouTuber and staying consistent. You taught me that change isn't always bad and life will always go on :) Much love towards everyone in this video but especially my childhood hero, Adam. <3
im glad sky is still funni
I would of loved ethoslab in this vid
As far as OG Minecraft YouTubers go, there is a serious lack of The Yogscast.
Sky....
Where is Stampy... he is one of the Oldest and Most Popular MC Youtubers at that time, and a lot of people Remember Him, Yes He Isn't doing as great As before but he was very popular and loved... and he loved his fans as much as they did.
Who else got the BMTH reference.
i remember bacon man! that was amazing!
Wow this was so nostalgic I loved every second of the video.
these people were my childhood bro.
We can all agree that Techoblade was of too!!!
But where is Stampy? He was one of the OG creators too...I actually never seen a Skydoesminecraft video and did not know about him until like a year.. two years ago? Crazy I know, but man should have had Stampy on here too.
Omfggg I remember Post Malone doing Minecraft songs with sky before he was “Post Malone” , damn my childhood gone 😭 but nun better than seeing them still doin there thing 💯
Where is the OG of the OG's seananners
What about LionMaker
Okay Anthony this is about my most favorite video I got started to watch it I used to watch these Minecraft YouTubers back in the OG days
Having watched sky daily as a kid, this made me smile
Wow haven’t heard these names in a while
ANHH LDSHADOWLADY MY BELOVED
my childhood comes back thank you so much
Early
wow seeing trayourus made me so emotional cause of nostalgia
Adam was my favourite part of this video lmao
When is "I spend a day with ADHDers" coming up, Anthony???
never would i ever think that lizzie would be in an anthony video ever but I LOVE IT
Vikkstar123, AliA, Lachlan and The Pack are the real underrated OG's
This is such a legendary video
love the vides padilla  and dan 💙💙💙
SkyDoesMinecraft's career got ended by KSI.
ALBERT
*To think the current generation of Minecraft YouTubers will be considered nostalgic to our kids.*
i remembered watching lizzie like 4-5 years ago and i still watch her to this day, she’s been my favorite person for so long now haha
Have a good day everyone 😊
You should have done it with popularmmos and stampy
next.. you should interview minecraft speedrunners :] like Illumina and others..! since its kind of a facet of minecraft thats really been blowing up recently!
Here for Lizzie <3 Been watching her for so many years.
the bring me the horizon reference thoooo lol
I miss the OG Dan and Sky. But I am so excited to see their humor evolving into new videos and music content!
Oh my God LDShadowLady raised me I've been watching and still watching since I was 5
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Popurlarommos
do one with popularmmos
I learned english from Dan’s videos, so I’ll always be grateful for the fun I had watching them.
Sky was most powerful cause he could say fuck
SKYDOESMINECRAFT AND BUTTER
literally the better minecraft youtubers
Last Minecraft video put out i was curious about Adam i seen he was going through a lot and I’m glad he’s here smiling and laughing
Bestie you should have added Ihascupquake she literally was OG OG she was literally the most subscribed female gamer of all time during her time. Of course that change till Aphmau and Ldshadowlady started to rise since Cupquake started to leave Minecraft
I watched lizzie when I was younger and I recently started watching again and it’s so much fun to relive the memories
stampylonghead though.
MY CHILDHOOD 😭😭😭
I started watching dantdm in 2013
All of these Minecrafters work so hard and deserve all the success they've gotten
I never fell out of my LDshadowlady phase
where stampy
Sky is just crazy
YOOOO these people were my childhood including lizzie <3
"I spent a day with smosh"
I would like to see ssundee, and stampylonghead
SkyDoesMinecraft, is he ok?
LIZZIEEEEEE AND ANTHONY TOGETHER?? OH MY GODDDDD 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You should do a part two
Adam is the man who's built my childhood and so much of what I enjoyed and made me very happy. Adam if you see this thank u dude, the interactions we've had, I appreciate it all. Please keep supporting Adam everyone he's epic Adam's music is SO good, I recommend,, well, all of his music LMAO  Never forget hashtag tysleftfoot✊ Edit because I can't shut up: also never forget drug run, epic jump map, budder dance, teacher minigame, cops n robbers, all those animations made by blue monkey
Sad that stampy wasnt interviewed on this, his mc vids were my childhood
No Paulsoaresjr? He was the first to make a Minecraft tutorial on YouTube.
I literally stopped at the half point of Fruit Basket Episode 11 Season 2 just to watch this video and I do not regret it.
you should do a part 2 with stampy and others
I still watch them all
Anthony should do one where he interviews himself. "I spent a day with ANTHONYPADILLA "
All I want is popularMMOS to do this he was iconic
wheres stampy 🤔🤔
anyone else thinks Adam sounds like Dream?
Stampy?? Popularmmos?
Shoutout chelsea smile
I feel the same as Lizzie about other people I know irl seeing my videos 1. Because of the bad quality cus I record on my laptop 2. People my terrible mic and I sound stupid
It's crazy to think about how much impact these people had on me and other people growing up. They were our upbringing, additionally from a foreign perspective, these people MADE me fluent in english. and they rarely get credit for that which is insane.
A-L-B-E-R-T
I remember when LDShadowLady was playing games with Krism and Minx, and they partied up with Seananners, Hutch, Gassy Mexican, Chilled Chaos, Diction, and Mr Sark. Those are the REAL OG moments.
I have never clicked so fast on this video than dream's subscriber count go up
Waiting for "I spent a day with VSAUCE" :>
Yes Lizzziiieeeee
everyone forgets popularmmos
Can we get Charlie(Penguinz0) in here aswell?
I've been waiting for the non-binary one ever since I saw he was looking for questions to ask non-binary people. I'm so stoked
Everyone else: shouts out their channels or friends channels  Adam: *THIS IS ALBERT*
I remember Zack Scott Games Minecraft server
I love so lizzie so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🧡🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚💙💙💙
Please make a video with former child protective services workers. At what point was the corruption too much for them? We need to see behind the scenes of legally kidnapping children for profit.
Hello
I think Anthony should do a video with Aphmau and her Minecraft career
I’m glad Adam is doing better :) also ALBERT WAS NICE
Ah yes the better minecraft youtubers
They're all Over or Under 30 years old, So yeah, We've really be- We need an Update on Stampy (I know He's Still Uploding but yeah, Personally I wanna see Him)
Dude I'm still watching DanTDM to this day, still watching after 7 years.
Thanks Anthony for bringing back my child hood
Adam is so chaotic….. I’ve missed him
Adam is still funny :").... but he jus
I remember the mod reviews with Dan TDM and hearing Sky call gold butter and yell at a squid in the background. During 2016 I was still attached to Minecraft and watched Aphmau's Roleplays. Somehow I connected over those roleplays and Minecraft's with my best friend and now we've been friends for almost 6 years
LIZZIEEEEEEE omg I used to watch her prop hunt vids
1:12 this was made on my birthday lol
you should spend a day with legendary Video game voice actor
Do Technoblade
If u feel sad go and listen to my first song "All I Need" 💙☁️🎸
Where stampy at…
sheesh
The fact Dan TDM is the sole reason I learned English fluently within a year is lowkey funny to me. I was nine and suddenly I could speak English fluently because I binged Dan's vids-
I love that sky still has the same humor
3:09 aka they found the first e-girl
The second I saw LDshadowlady I clicked faster then light
Anthonypaedilla interviews Anthony FROM SMOSH
Can i suggest a day with fortnite youtubers? ( And if so please add lachlan)
Hey Anthony. I don’t know if you know vanossgaming or his friends. I really want you to interview them cuz they were my childhood too.
When Dan said someone asked him if he was DanTDM in the middle of peeing- I died laughing 😂
I love how Dan and Liz just so calm and respectful and Adam is just there absolutely unhinged. Never really stopped watching him I still absolutely love the album he did in 2018 time traveler still one of my fav songs to this day
This video really made me happy 😄
Anthony should do one where he interviews himself. "I spent a day with ANTHONYPADILLA "
Skydoesminecraft was my childhood
These 3 were my childhood, I feel old and I'm not even in my 20's
hello anthony padilla and i am with jeseus
When Dan said he didn't collab with anyone so he just used mobs I said "oh- that's sad" out loud even though I already knew he did that 😅
SkyDoesMinecraft went from Minecraft to Exorcism and I don't know how his transition went
Isn’t betterhealth super sus?
can you spend a day with technoblade??
You Forgot Man Like Vikkstar123. :/
You Forgot Man Like Vikkstar123. :/
<3
We love Albert
My childhood in one video...nice!
Dan and lizzy: this changed our lives   Sky: A    l    b    e    r    t
man, i’ve missed sky’s energy :) so excited to hear his music
Lizze!
The OG minecraft youtubers will forever be better than all of dreamsmp. Pewdiepie and mumbo jumbo are legends, hopefully they will collab with skydoesminecraft, dan, captainsparkelz. I am glad minecraft made a epic comeback in 2019.
You need to react to smosh
(at 15:37)        yeehawchu
I've been watching lizzie for 5-6 years and she still entertains me! :D
I was kinda expected jeromeasf to be here
My nastolgic heart
ive been watching dan for the past 7 years and ive grown with him he is my inspiration
SKYDOESMINECRAFT WAS MY CHILDHOOD!!! I MISS TEAM CRAFTED SO MUCH!! i'm 18 now turning 19 soon
both lizzie and dan were my childhood, i'm nearing young adulthood and i still watch them 😭💗✋
i still remember watching danTdm back when his name was like, the diamond minecart.
my childhood god damn
you should do an interview with tomska
where is stampylongnose lmao
where technoblade its time for the monthly techno content
Peep that BMTH reference!!!
I hate that kids nowadays say that Minecraft is gone and not fun and it’s all about the other games now😥
All I have to say is these guys are my childhood ♥️♥️
Those who dont even remember that any of these still upload weren't really the biggest fans after I stopped watching dan like 3 4 years ago I would still check on him every couple months and I started to watch him again like 8 months ago
What about popularmmos
I am so happy that Lizzie was in this video. I have been watching her since I was like 6-7 and she was the person who got me into gaming. :D
YEEEES LDSHADOWLADY DESERVES THISSSS
"Albert" -Adam Dahlberg
I wish stampy was there
Rip Anthonys roof
It's Adam!
Lizzie was a big part of my childhood. I'm an only child and watching her videos made me feel very happy, and because you could tell that her personality was in her videos, it felt like I wasn't alone. I still occasionally watch her videos because it brings me back to such good memories. I'm a lot older now, but I will never forget the joy and fun times I had while watching her videos.
A day with technoblade
13:29 dantdm and popularmmos my first mincraft youtubers I started watching in like 2014 or 2013-
aw I've missed Adam!! Him, Dan and Lizzie really were where it all began!!
"shoutout anything you want" Adam grabs dog "ALBERT"
I hope Lizzie knows that there are shadow cadets who have watched her videos for ten years and will continue watching her videos for as long as she loves making them.💖
Can i get a hello from my fellow shadow cadets?
i forgot that Sky actually lived with Post Malone that is actually crazy.
I’m so happy about this it feels like the OGs are being forgotten :’))
It’s crazy to think how all of them raised me & were my whole childhood.
LDShadowLady was my childhood
Dan was like a dad for most of us for a while back in 2015 and now he has his own son and that’s really cool
I love that ldshadowlady is still doing so well with her content. She really Made my childhood better :D
WOOOOO THAT WAS AMAZING
I LOVE ldshadowlady
Dan and stampy cat were literally my childhood
Omg I used to watch all of them so much 😭💖
These people taught me english, especially Lizzie and Dan Like they were a big part of my childhood
Ah, nostalgia is a great feeling
There isn’t even 10B people
dan and sky was my childhoood maan
Can you please do Pewdiepie or Mrbeast next? That would be very interesting!
8:14
I was like 8 and i watch every single skydoesminecraft video ,no shit
one of the reason i'm bilingual with english as a second language is because i watched so many lizzie's videos, safe to say that she raised me 😌
I watched ldshadowlady when I was younger than like a month ago I started watching her videos again and I love watching them just as much as when I was little
It's a Shame Stampylonghead wasn't interviewed or Iballisticsquid
Ngl I almost cried when dan was talking about fans and old fans.
I was dying when Dan was talking about his experience in Grand Central Station lol
Wheres stampy ):
This was refreshing, it's crazy to watch og Minecraft YouTubers like Stampy, Dan TDM, ldshadowlady, and aphmau. all these years ago and then start watching  Minecrafters now like, Dream, Tommyinnit, and Ranboo, etc. It's just weird to be able to say that.
Albert almost looks exactly like my dog 🐶
DO STAMPY
This was so fun! They were all such a huge part of my childhood! Could you do a part two with stampy? it would mean the world to me, he helped me through all the hard parts of my childhood and continues to today even though i'm almost 18.
its very good to see sky doing well.
I can't believe Adam actually joined up. Good to see him doing better. They were all pretty much my childhood
Where is pat and Jen and stampy
"niHAchu" 15:37
Skydoesminecraft looks like post malone. I said it
You should do I spent a day with the CEO of Smosh, Ian. And for 8 minutes just make it be silent in the room and Anthony should just nod and pretend he’s saying something and write in a notebook
IM SO HAPPY LIZZIE WAS IN HERE I HAVE BEEN SUBBED TO HER SINCE 2015 AND STILL WATCH HER TILL THIS DAY
Little idea "I spent a day with hermitcrafters" they are also Minecrafters on a server, that has millions of Views
You should've brought Stampy on tbh
im gonna say it now, when i saw adam being so much more bright and enthusiastic, it made my childhood heart scream with relief. he was one of my fav ccs when i was a kid and he made me laugh when i was the only friend i had.  hearing about everything he had gone through once i got older made me so sad that someone who constantly made me laugh was dealing with so much. seeing him being a different, happier person makes me so happy. :)
its really cool seeing lizzie in this video :)) ive been subscribed since 2014/2015
Sky and LD are 1st generation, Dan is 2nd generation, Technoblade/Skeppy are 3rd generation, Tommyinnit is 4th generation
I kinda hoped captainsparklez would be in this video
I WANR A PART 22222222 I WISH TO SEE POPULARMMOS he was my childhood!
My childhood
love the vid!!! can you do a video on PMDD. its an awful disorder and not a lot of people know about it but it sucks. i would know :c
Ldshadowlady skydoesminecraft chimmneyswift ihascupquake and captinsparkles was my go to Minecrafters back in the day lol
wheres PewDiePie?
I’m 14 and this is deep
its really cool to see them talk about this stuff!
Ldshadowlady built my personality i literally adore her🥰🥰
Syndicate’s Minecraft Project was a huge bright side of my childhood, that and Mianite. Or of course, the classic cops and robbers
I started watching Ldshadowlady when I was like 10 and she’s still my favorite YouTuber
so glad you did an og minecraft youtubers, still watch them after being subscribed for who knows how many years
Dan raised me when my mother wouldn't.
Ah yes Anthony spends a day with my childhood
My three childhood coming together
no stampy or squid !? 😵‍💫😵‍💫
one day we’ll get a stampy interview 😔
dantdm and ldshadowlady was my chilhood
*This will change your life forever today. For Catholics on YouTube: 1woksape Catholic spiritual warfare
Ugh I miss Adam I wish he’d just make literally ANY content. He’s so fuckin funny no one has humor like him. YouTube misses his presence fs
SKY
ohmygod
Is Mikey dead?
dantdm is literally my childhood hes the first ytber i watched
Dan and Sky are staples of my childhood
Dan was a dad to millions before he became an actual dad
Can you make I spent a day with greasy people
There’s just something about Youtubers calling other Youtubers a big fan
there is one much older that probably introduced a large majority of what people call the og's  my main man davidxangel
Anthony intreview me east
Sky still hasnt changed, i love him so much.  as a kid id pick up any mannerism from ppl id admire and now im stuck with this stutter that I got from sky lol
But were stampy at tho
Hey look it's the clone dude from apex legends😳
Is Sky good????
Came here for lizzie
awe man, really hoped to see popularMMoS, remember i loved his content before
Wowwww what a throwback to sky 😅
This man is holding one of the best mics you can have for audio production and then use the Webcam audio lol
Rip stampys whole community like him, squid and Amy along with popularmmos along with a lot of the girls that were on Lizzie’s oasis series like vengelf and yammy. Honestly a lot of them disappeared and that genuinely makes me sad.
i’ve been waiting for this one
Kinda sad that Popularmmos isnt here
He is even better than the news
I saw LDShadowlady and clicked as fast as I could
Where the fork is CaptainSparklez?!
Genuinely, I love Lizzie and I don't watch her nowadays as much but I still go back once a year or so and watch her og solo survival and shadowcraft series - they both provided me with so much happiness and helped me fall in love with minecraft. Lizzie, along with many other mc youtubers but mainly lizzie, really made me who I am today. This video was amazing - i am so full of Nostalgia rn!
I still watch Lizzie
FINALLY DANTDM IS HERE!
Is it crazy to think that someday, someone who subscribed to one of these minecrafters in their heyday will never unsubscribe, simply because they passed away. It's weird to think that our accounts will exist and stay subscribed, even centuries after we pass away.
LDshadowlady was my childhood favourite and I still come back and binge watch her videos now and again. I related to her so much as a kid and I’ll never forget how she sparked my love for gaming
It’s nice to see Adams face again.
somehow just somehow please get Technoblade.
5 year old me is screaming that there all together
LDShadowlady was my whole childhood 😢  Good to see Lizzie still going strong~
ALBERT!
What about Lewis and Simon from yogscast
You should do a show with cold ones
Lizzie and Dan: Shouting put to their fans and things closest to them  Adam: Ä̶̹́̾̀͑͋͘̚Ḷ̴̡͔̓B̴̢̨̛̙̘̖̲̭̏́̚E̵̲̝̮̲͈̿͛R̸̘̗͓͕̈́̐̿̿́̔͒̋̄͜T̸͇͕͛̅̎͝
You guys remember than Adam has a kid right? What happened to his kid WHAT HAPPENED?!?
In my head after reading the title: “what about aphmau 🥲”
YOU CATFISH! WHERE THE ACTUAL HELL IS STAMPY
Alternative Title: Legends spent a day with god
Me when a youtuber asks me to subscribe even though i already am: "Tf you expect me to do? double subcribble?"
WHERE IS STAMPY
No popularmmos?
Sky helped me a lot in getting through my high school years. I'm really happy that he was included here and remembered by many as a huge source of comfort and happiness when they were younger. His Do Not Laugh videos were always the highlight of my week back then lmaoo
Bro Skye changed 🧍🏻‍♂️ haven't checked up on him in a while damn
Dan, we will never forget you
When you meet jaiden can you ask why she isn’t uploading much
Where's Stampy? :(
imagine calling for an exorcism and skydoesminecraft shows up
Adam seems a lot happier now, I used to and still do watch his content, I love revisiting the old days and keeping up with his music and participating in the art events on his discord. Adam is literally the person who inspired me to start YouTube content, stuff that I just post for no real rhyme or reason just for fun with some friends or random ideas I have. I subbed to him around 700k, and I've kept up with everything throughout all the years, so I've seen or seen bits of his mental low after all he's had to deal with, and seeing him right here in this video being happy and laughing genuinely and just openly being himself makes me really happy for him. As he releases more content I know I'll still be there to support him like I always have.  Forever part of the Sky Army and Nobody Nation! Thanks for everything you've done to help people, Adam.
Bruh, Sky played RuneScape???? (I’ve never watched his videos before)
Real OGs would remember Butter is the best Minecraft item! Better than diamonds.
bro i was gonna expect aphmau in this since shes like one of my childhoods when it came to minecraft roleplays and minecraft mini game with skydoesminecraft and ldshadowlady like the five nights at freddies, minions and ihop hide n seek ahhhh so much memories
I like how Anthony is a bit serious with Dan or LDShadowLady and then there’s Adam where he’s just joking around with him
15:28 BOY WHAT
Yeeeee I’m so proud of u Lizzie! U deserve everything <3
I'm actually rlly impressed with Sky in this vid. Hands down. Great vid 👏🏾
I’m still out here calling gold “butter.” Good times back then.
can you do a video on dislexic people????
ADAM! god this episode was my whole childhood I'm geekin out.
Interview with the Smosh Crew?
Dan: talks about dream smp. Anthony: proceeds to show tommy mod video.
DANTDM AND SKYDOESMINECRAFT LETS GOOOO
Ngl I was kinda expecting Little kelly or little carly to be on here
I can't believe Skydoesminecraft got to see what PRE-MALONE was like
Lizzie and Dan I watch/ed
Who remembers custom mod adventures of dantdm.
Pls spent your day with valorant players
My childhood is here
You know what I'm glad with? I'm glad that Adam's(Sky) Chaotic Energy is still there after so many years since I've last viewed him, since I've last watched those quite the chaotic mc vids, despite the drama. And I miss I think his name was Ross? The derpy player at Adams mc series of show and tell.
I started playing Minecraft since title update 12 on the playstation 3.
You shouldve interviewed Ssundee.
I'm remembering back to when I went to Dans Minecraft concert in Lunar Park with Evil Dan and that's crazy how much these YouTubers change.
Não tem o Vinícius 13, dislike
waiting for technoblade to be in one of your interviews
these three were literally my childhood
I sence something is off...  Creeper...  **no response**
HOLY SHIT... My 12 yro self is screaming rn, A crossover between Anthony and Skydoesminecraft
I miss Adam ;(
There would be pat from popularmmos but...he's having a rough time Like,his intro is still the same after all these years
i've watched DanTDM since i was 8 and now i'm 16. he was my fav youtuber ever, i watched him before school, after school, during lunch, i'd download the mods he use to showcase, i had all his merch from hoodies to dolls, and for my 11th birthday i went to his show and got a meet and greet. although i don't watch him anymore i still love dan and i'll never forget the happiness he brought me as a kid.
kids nowadays in the future: "People born in 2020-2021 knows this OG minecrafter (dream, Georgenotfound, tommyinnit, etc.) "
Dan and Lizy: shout out to-  Adam: A L B E R T
Can't belive I've been watching Lizzie since 2011, almost the start of her career and now here she is, Legendary OG Minecrafter <3
the og for me was stampylongnose XD
Did Captainsparkles say nooooo to this
"i expect people to move on" - ldshadowlady, that's funny because i've been watching her since i was around 9 and now i'm 15 and to this day i enjoy her content as much as i did back then!
No CaptainSparklez :/
YESSS!!
Adam looks a lot happier. I’m glad he’s doing better.
Really glad that Adam looks so energetic and happy.
I think you should have *stampylonghead* in a video if he hasn't been in one yet
I've been blocked by skydoesminecraft, biggest achievement ever, but i was very heartbroken when it happened </3 adam if u see this please unblock me I'm sorry
HOW BLOODY DARE YOU SPELL TRAYAURUS WRONG
I wish you could do this again with stampy, I ballistic squid, and captain sparklez
Change thumbnail to "25 BILLION+ views" instead of "25.1 BILLION views". looks better + more "intimidating" in my opinion
I cant explain how happy i am to see sky in a youtube video bro.
aphmu never ending mc content. u should had have her
I’m so excited for the jaiden video wow
LESSGOOOO I'M SO HYPED WHENEVER I SEE DAN HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love how sky is till his hipped self (again)
SkyDoesMinecraft changed my life :')
i still love all three 🥺
THAT FUCKING BRING MET THE HORIZON REFRENCES ANTHONY U CANT JUST DO THAT, MY INNER EMO IS SCREAMING
After knowing what happened to Sky previously, seeing him here and looking and doing well, makes me glad and relieved that's he's doing okay
I love sky.
wheres stampy tho
im sorry " ni ha chu" she even said how to pronounce her name dude
everyone forget that smosh is the real childhood?
Tysm for this video anthony <3
i started watching sky when i was 11 man. his minecraft stuff was a really pleasant part of my childhood/transitional period from primary to secondary school <3
can you do one where you talk to all other at the same time, like a YouTuber meeting
The real title is “Smosh Founder talks to the Greek Gods” (Phenic your welcome)
You should do with people like mumbo jumbo and grian , they're like soo huge in mcyt
I watch Dan & Liz 2-3 yrs. ago  she mentioned ZackScottGames  i watch him when i was 10-13 rewatching what i watch and yea TvT just being an og fan and i feel old even if i don't look old--
daaaaaamn I have not seen SkyDoesMinecraft for so long! kinda miss that time
Top 10 minecraft youtuber that swore
Just wanted to say thank you to the comment sections. Seeing people posted their comment and reading it makes me happy. It gives me a better perspective of the community. Although we might be different people we all have  the same compassion for YouTubers we love.  😍 OG Youtubers will always stay in my heart.
where is captain
Yahoo
Why does Adam sound like Bacon Man?
Omh ldshadowlady, i loved watching her videos 😭
Hi Anthony Padilla is it possible if you could have an interview with YouTube Airsofters?
Those little clips all gave me such nastolgia
DO with SSundee pls he is my childhood
XDDD HE MISSPELLED TRAYAURUS WHEN DAN'S SHOUT-OUT PART WAS ROLLING
o7 man.
you should do a part 2 where you interview stampy,pat & jen from popularMMOs, captainSparklez
Do y’all remember stampycat
why did he say nihachu like that
Where Techno?
captainsparklez: am i a joke to you?!
16:01 love that cheeky chelsea smile reference lol
Did no one noticed that Sky (Adam) was the only one who wasn't subscribed to? Lizzie and Dan's were already grey but Adam's was still red💀
I hope there's a part 2 with Stampylonghead, PopularMMOs and CaptainSparklez
checkout legend of technoblade
I love adam's energy on and in everything 😂 <3
You should do "I SPENT  A DAY WITH DYSLEXIC PEOPLE"  (Im dyslexic and would love to see how other people coped in school... 😁
Lizzie in the Crazycraft, Shadowcraft, One Life SMP are one of the iconic series
shadowlady 4 life
You should have call Captainsparklez
Man they were the ones that thought me English
damn my childhood in 22:16 min
*"Interviewing the best part and people in your childhood"*
If You do a part 2 then please put stampy  in it
i wish ssundee was there haha
Dan and lizzy raised me and i will take that stament to my grave
Seeing Sky so happy is so relieving to me because I remember being there when he was depressed and when he quit Minecraft and videos, and also when he came back. It was insane to see how, when he first came back, he was so different because of his healing process. I'm so happy for him that he's getting back to that point where he's enjoying what he does. (I hope this doesn't sound wrong, I'm struggling a bit with wording this haha- but overall I just mean that it's good to see Sky doing well)
Iizzie: Shoutout to my husband Smallishbeans! Dan: Shoutout to Dr. Treyaurus! Adam: ALBERT!!!!
Who like Minecraft     “I pretty sure someone already said this in the comments but I’m saying it again”
He should’ve added ihascupquake😩
Interview smosh please it’d be very entertaining
No grian ? 🥺
LIZZIEEEEE
part 2 with stampy, popularmmos and jen :)
I'll never leave Ldshadowlady not until she leaves. I love her videos so much. Can you one day have an interview with Georgenotfound?
I feel ofended that you didn’t include philza 💀/j
Imagine a one on one talk with CoryxKenshin
Damn...I totally forgot that 2 videos daily was the norm for gamers back in the day.. I can't grasp how draining that can actually be
Wheres stampy😪
"sometimes existing is exhausting" I felt that
damnnn sky, it's been forever since i've seen him and he looks like he's doing so such better, practically raised me and i see him as a father figure i didn't have a child thank you for being there even if you didn't know it! and i will support your music!
Can we get a video dedicated to DanTDM like dream and corpse
I'm so happy to see LDShadowLady on this channel!!
The most legendary OG minecrafters are yogscast, paulsoaresjr, X.. those 3 made minecraft what it is today
Where’s stampy cat 🥺😖
OMG LIZZIE
*Sees DanTDM* YUP IM CLICKING
DanTDM was my childhood
Love Adam man, guy inspired me to make content and be me
this was such a nostalgic and good video!! but wHY is nobody talking about the bring me the horizon reference???? ARE WE GETTING I SPENT A DAY WITH OLI SYKES??????
Good to see sky out there vibeing, he has had a tough time with his mental health and people he hung around. Hahaha. Wtf was that shadow people bit. Whelp hope his music take off
My childhood holy shit
ADAM IS SO HIGH OMG BAHAHAHHAHAHAH
I don’t know who to thank, Post or Sky? Because I know one of them changed the other in a drastic way.
no philza?
interview smosh
Dans only 29???? Bro wtf
Someone should interview you
lizzieeee
Where's mumbo jumbo!!!!!!
I used the skins of them everytime lol
Keep pumping out the great content Anthony!
im proud to have lizzie as one of my childhood creators....               i still watch her.
Let's ask the guy with 25 million subs and 18 billion views if he wants to shout something out lmfao
LDSHADOWLADY AHHH
I love that Dan doesn't call out Anthony for swearing. BadBoyHalo is funny but it could (not yet) get obnoxious. Dan doesn't do that at all so it's amazing!
Dr. "Trey"aurus......this is an outrage
The thing that blew my mind the most was when Dan said he was only 29. I used to watch him a lot but slowly, and I mean like a whole year slowly, fell out of his stuff and stopped watching him. But a couple months ago, I got back into his old content and started to watch some of his newer stuff and by god do I still enjoy it. Last time I watched him is probably... 10, or 11 years old? I'm now 17 and yeah, he's still really fun. I am so shocked yet so happy that he's kept making videos.
Wait isn't is sky the guy who made a shitty diss track about ksi.  His mc content is still gold tho.
Ngl, when you first left smosh I felt resentful. I refused to watch your new channel because I was still bitter. But i love the content and I’ve been binging your vids all night.
It doesn't count if you didn't invite capitain Sparklez
A bit bummed you didn't get to interview Stampy he was my favourite, but this was still such nice trip to nostalgialand :D
Anthony, hold up 3 fingers in your next video if the mcyt community are blackmailing you into repeatedly covering them
I literally grew up on sky does Minecraft and team craft it was the BEST they were my absolute favorite  I lived for the prison escape videos like oh my god!!!!
Honestly this video put such a big smile on my face. As someone who grew up with these content creators it really just hit a special place in my heart
Dude I've been watching Dan sense before he broke his hand like 5(?) years back and it's amazing to see how far he has come now. He has a KID. That's so weird to me. I remember watching QnA videoes where people would ask if he would ever had kids and now he does have one, it's amazing. I love having watched him grow as a person and a content creator.
I actually really miss Adam's prime
I MISSED SKY SO MUCH HE DIDNT DISAPPOINT LMAO
I JUST SAW THIS IN MY NOTIFICATIONS AND IM DYING I GRIEW UP WITH THESE PEOPLE HOLY SHIT AHSGAHSHAH
Wish SSundee was here tbh
ngl i find the old stuff as less cringe than now
I used to watch skydoesmincraft so much as a kid. Now as an (barely) adult, I’m really glad to see how he’s doing. Cant wait to stream his music! 😁
Not even close baby TechnoBlade never dies
YOU MUST SPEND A DAY WITH SMOSH
I think sky is high :////
Dantdm My beloved ily sooooooooooooooooooooooooo muchhhhhhhhhhhchchchchchchchhch
Love from India 🇮🇳 ♥️♥️
Minecraft pog
Dream and the other Minecrafters will never top this people, change my mind.
The fact that Lizzie shout outed Joel is the sweetest thing ever
Please, enough with MinecraftxD
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE ADAM
Someone better clip this and send it to the pewdiepie subreddit i wanna see his reaction🤣🤣🤣
Stampylongnose !!!!
Dan is a TV his new name:DanTV
This video brought back so many feels 🥺🥺 sky is just the most adorbs human ever ✨
no stampy? :(
Wow he rlly managed to say the intro in 1 breath
Adam was the first Minecraft YouTuber that I've watched and he had a very huge impact on my life. Even though I don't watch him as I use too. He still and will forever have a place in my heart
Can't believe Dan shouted out his best friend. What a great guy.
their videos were my childhood
man im just happy to see sky bro
LUCKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
YO WHAT DANTSM AAAAAAAQ
Time for level 100 Boss: TECHNOBLADE
Pog
3:34 i can feel you the DanTDM till this day i never completed Minecraft with anyone i only did it myself...
You know who we need                                                   *P A T*
I think we missed the legend, Technoblade literally my OG youtuber right beside Dan.
THE OLD SCHOOL BMTH REFERENCE YESSSS EMOS RISE UP
Only og dantdm viewers remember the MoreTDM channel
I LOVE MINECRAFT SO MUCH ; i always play minecraft everyday
i hope we get a interview about tf2 veterans
Sky is still such an interesting guy haha so glad I grew up with his videos !! excited for his music too I’m sure it’ll be wild :]
I remember the times when I was a child (10-12 years old), watching Dans videos. I didn’t even fully understand how YouTube worked, but I loved his content. Currently, I’m 18 and I will always remember the great times Dan gave me in my childhood.
Now i know smalllish Bean is the husband of shadow lady
i had a HUGE crush on lizzie when i was like 10 yet i only realised this now because gay
I'm kinda sad syndicate wasn't on here his miante series I feel was the best story based Minecraft experience to date.
Do Yogcast next! Or or some more members of Dream SMP :3
LIZZIE WAS MY CHILDHOOD i started watching her when i was 7 or 8 and now im 14 so thanks lizzie for being an amazing inspiration <3
sky isnt gonna like the new mob that was chosen from the vote
**LDShadowLady swears**  Top5 Youtubers: Its free real estate
SPEND A DAY WITH TOBUSCUS
Lizzie’s and Dan’s videos were my whole childhood and I still watch their content every now and then. They had a huge impact on what I did as a child and who my idols were and I started playing minecraft/video games because of them.
Adam is just such a joy to watch
Lizzie literally has been my favorite yt for like as long as ive been on yt
mad respect
wtf... why isnt captain sparklez here....
no i has cupquake?
I used to watch Sky so much growing up, well my wee sister did and I watched it with her and he'd curse A LOT so mum told us to turn it off but we'd just turn it on again because he made us laugh. He's so funny 😂
I miss sky and his Minecraft content, that was my childhood
I remember watching dan and adam a lot when i was younger and just nostalgia comes back to when i watched them and laughed and got happiness
This is making me feel old… I was OBSESSED with Sky and learnt English thanks to constantly watching his videos. Wishing everyone in this video the best, so happy to see them again :)
Aww i would've loved to see popularmmos in this!! I've loved him for so many yearss!♥️💕
I wouldnt wish for a better childhood then this
ALBERT IS THE BEST
that i dont sweat *my responce* "wdym everyone sweats- oh he said swear nvm"
Dude reading the name skydoesminecraft almost made me cry. He made my childhood.
I will always be subscribed to Sky and Lizzie out of respect. I grew up in a pretty shitty household so the people I watched on YouTube raised me more than my own parents. Sky was probably the first YouTuber I ever watched and I will always be thankful that I had something to distract myself from the things around me. Mad respect for my childhood idols
Should have brought stampy
Damn dantdm was probably the first youtuber i started watching. I owe him a lot for teaching me English :)
I enjoyed this video alot  since it brang my childhood back to me,  i do still watch LDshadowlady but like dan and sky i remember staying up watching them in particular seeing when their going to post which was amazing to watch, i was hoping to see the other legends who i think they r and thats stampy, pewdiepie, popularmmos, sparkles, little kelly, little carly and all the others like they carried Minecraft in my opinion since i would remember seeing them on my recommendations on youtube i would click the video and see them, idk if any of yall saw them but i remember them the most
Do Vanossgaming next
sky giving me so much nostalgia
Shoulda add Techno tho :D great vid!
I LOVE LIZZE DTFCGVH
Not to be rude but Where is CAPTAINSPARKLEZ 😢😢
i used to remember watching all of this youtubers
Ssundee
Pewdiepie is definitely somewhere in me lmao
Bruhhhh Adam Barely talked, i wanted to see more, dif he say bad things or something?
the richest youtuber is not pewdiepie its bill gates
Do a vid with Cory kenshin
OG minecrafters and you didn't interview the yogscast? For shame.
LIZZIE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAA
If stampy was in this I would cry
Adam should totally make an original Minecraft song Netnobody style! 👌😎
Y’all want some real OG’s of Minecraft? Paulsoaresjr and Yogscast. They both made stuff of the extremely, extremely early Minecraft.
love to see that sky hasn't changed after all this time. see you in three months
I loved this video! Thanks for the effort! I'm glad to report I still follow Dan haha.   I'd love to see a part 2 of this!! I would love to hear CaptainSparklez who I also still watch, there are so many OG left :P
WHERE IS STAMPY
:o Another OG Minecrafter is popularmmos. I cried when i went back to their channel because all of my memories had just can back and I smiled again :’)
BRB SOBBING
lmao i forgot that post malone was actually a mnecraft yter
WHAT ABOUT STAMPYYYYYY
WHY ISNT STAMPY HEREEE SKSNSISBJZSJNSNS
NetNobody and Post Malone collab when?
“ because existing is exhausting “  Yes . Anthony, yes.
DID I SAW WILLBUR HEEEEEEH!???
Ive been watching LDshadowlady since i was 4 now im 13, time really went brrrrr ❤❤❤
omg hes gonna make a Bring me the horizon video
i started tearing up tbh
Where was the captain man
I love Adams energy, he seemed so happy and excited to be on the show😂
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  I saw a secondhand skydoesminecraft plush at a market stall a few years ago and i so regret not getting it just for the nostalgia
Sky didn’t really fit with these two, he should of been replaced with someone else
I was born may 2006 and ever since march 6th 2011 Sky has been a huge part of my life. One of the greats i'll never leave behind.
i love how sky is still a crackhead to this day
getting real weird vibes from skydoesmc
Technoblade pls next video
What about doing a video on hermitcraft? One of the biggest minecraft youtube smp's thats been running for almost 10 years
I'm dissapointed not seeing PopularMMOs or PewDiePie
Sky is low key terrifying I- pls help
Dan was so much of my childhood and when i got to the age where i was starting to curse i watched sky. these people practically raised me
Stampy longnose be like 👁👄👁
I hope the next video is “I spent a day with Obama”
Lizzie made me love Minecraft all over again. Glad she's still going strong :)
Thank you for adding my butter lord, looking forward to hearing skys music
OK BUT THE VIDEO WITH JAIDEN ANIMATIONS
Anthony: You have 5 seconds to promote anything go! Lizzie and Dan: actually promotes Adam: A L B E R T
Dan is the real OG lets be real
I feel old after seeing them
The crazy thing is my steam account name is trayaurus because of when I made it
Those ceiling repair costs must really be stacking up by now...
roman atwood
i love sky sm he was my childhood <3
I thought Im gonna see technoblade
No one watches og minecrafters, unfortunately. People watches trending YouTubers. I'm sad.
I want to see a ”i sped a day with hermitcraft youtubers”
pre malone was a part of my childhood and i had no idea
10 hours
I've watched lizzie for like 7 years and still do <3
My childhood
YOOOO THIS IS GONNA BE POGGERS! THIS IS GONNA BE FUCKING FANTASTIC! CAN'T FUCKING WAIT! :0
them talking about uploading a lot of videos is like the opposite of tecnoblade
the fact that Lizzie and Dan out here giving heartfelt shoutouts and Adams just fucking waving Albert around like a flag
anthonyshould play mc with minecrafters
it made me so happy to see adams face
im mad you didnt get stampy
We need a pt.2 with like like stampy and all them!!
A little sad Stampy wasn't here but it's okay I guess 🥲
Where's Captain Sparklez?
Lots of Comments: *talking about how they grew up watching Lizzie and Dan*  Childhood me: *binge watching Adam and Dan*
What about Pewdiepie???
everyone: hey its LDShadowLady me: Hey look its joels wife
I'm a very simple man. I see Dantdm, I click
This video made me sad, I miss watching sky and dans mod videos😭😭
Dream will absolutely pass danTDM and that makes me sad
Anthony dropping that bmth reference tho
interview stampycat. my fav first youtuber
nooooooooo jardon wasnt here, ruined video, great video tho 10/10
As someone who had access to the internet at a very young age, Lizzie was my childhood, I still remember giggling hard watching her videos. I still click on her videos when they're in my recommend, good on her for still going strong
In a culinary context, courgette is treated as a vegetable, which means it is usually cooked and presented as a savoury dish or accompaniment. Botanically, however, the courgette is an immature fruit, being the swollen ovary of the female courgette flower.
I wish lizzie would post more, she truly is my favorite YouTuber
Been a while since I've heard of Sky, but I did name my cat after him so I guess he has always been on my mind
I love this
how has sky managed to still have that infectious laugh even after all these years  the man's a legend
Dan and Lizzie were both such huge parts of my childhood, and now i'm almost 20 :')
What about captain sparklez?? Yogscast??
Omg DanTDM! I used to watch him when I was 7 back in like 2013 😭
I’ve been in the Minecraft community for years and somehow I’ve never heard of skydoesminecraft HOW DID I MISS HIM?
maybe its just me but im 18 and i still watch ldshadowlady’s videos, i started watching maybe when i was 12 or so?
these minecrafters aren't the only og's, they should've included the legends (Stampy and Squid)
rip no captain sparklez :(
My og YouTuber is stampy
all of my friends and i spent so much time watching lizzie when we were younger— it’s insane how much of an impact someone can have on your life when they don’t know you at all
Ah yes, my Childhood heroes
COME BACK TO SMOSH ANTHONY      PLEASE  PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aw watching these video made me think of the past. I am a huge fan of Dream smp and their roleplays and content, but the only og minecrafter that I really enjoyed watching roleplays was Aphmau. I remember waking up early everyday to watch Minecraft diaries and mystreet. Honestly nothing can top her when it comes to  production and story making<3
I remember staying up until 3am watching DanTDMs videos with my brothers. I was grounded for a week, but it is one of my favorite movies. My mom walked by and started yelling at me and my brothers. Fun times.
this is epic but WHERE IS STAMPY
Did anyone else notice that he's subscribed to everyone except sky lmao
Sorry Anthony but you weren’t even close to saying Nikies name right
hopefully next time etho and stampy would be on this
im glad to see sky is still going i may have watched dan alot too sky was my favorite i was always so happy to get to watch one of his videos when it came out or going back to rewatch a video to this day i still go back to watch some of his older videos
i love lizzie sm i’m so happy she’s in this video
WHERES STAMPYYYY
I literally did a happy dance when lizzie said the shadow cadets cause I still actively watch her stuff :)
I watch Lizzie when I was in high school, years later I'm on my last year of college, I'm still watching her. HER CONTENT IS SO GOOD!!
Sky seems like such a chill guy.
God this video made me wanna cry, all the memories man.
i can never thank dan enough for making my childhood amazing
My childhood.....oh my God
Honestly i think gmod youtubers deserve some love, i mean vanossgaming did a lot gmod and he became one of the most popular or kuledud3/msbreezy who had a bunch of funny gmod videos
Love the video but I think that popularmmos, stampy, and Ssundee should have been there too
sky being off the fuckin rails was and always will be my favourite part of his content
Dantdm and Ldshadowlady literally were one of the first youtubers I subscribed to and now seeing them come so far is making so damn proud right now T-T
These guys literally made my childhood man, the nostalgia is crazy.
s
fucking hell dude skydoesminecraft, dantdm, stampy, aphmau, popularmmos, they raised me. i remember going over to me friend's house and watching the newest dantdm video with dr. trayaurus or craig the mailman. i remember the day my friend got minecraft on their xbox 360 and we tried to start a youtube channel similar to little kelly and little carly. i remember when my biggest concern in life was getting into stampy's lovely garden (not there yet, but when i do you'll know i've made it). i remember when popular mmos's titanic seriers was my go-to shit. i remember how whenever i watched aphmau there would be an underlying gay feeling in my chest for katelyn or michi, and just how obsessed i was with her minecraft diaries series. FUCK and when aphmau did try not to laugh challenges with skydoesminecraft, ross, barney, and jinbop. and as much as i think growing up on the internet has fucked with me a bit (bttv emotes being my only way of expressing emotion) i wouldn't give this up for anything
lets goo
next interview arcade craniacs
I wish stably was here
Man I miss going home from school and watching dantdm videos so much, good times
i would be disappointed if some kid commented "do dream smp members now plsss"
Stampy where ?? Yoda sad
Yeah, DanTDM for me was like the best in 2016 or 2017
my guy got relations with post malone lmao
Not the biggest fan of the high pitched ringing in the video. I will check to see if it's my headphones but idk I hope so. Good to see you sky! Thanks for this video
20:35 I whould have loved to see Dan swear
Jaiden!
Is honey only on PC?
man if ssundee was here he would just say foot..
what ever happened to og smosh you and ian were sooo funny
I’m so glad I’ve seen sky’s face after so long :) he’s changed so much but he seems so much more happier. I hope the best for him
When I saw the title I was expecting CaptainSparklez and got disappointed... But good video though
Technoblade please
Dan still so cute 🤗
oh my gosh :D
Lizzie's content never grow boring. She's so charming, there's something about her that whenever i watch her i feel so comforted
You should do another video like this with grian, scar, iskall etc
ADAM NO WAY🥺🥺
God I fucking love Net so much. I’ve been rewatching his old videos and also seeing this interview, his humor has definitely held up with mine throughout the years. Mans fucking awesome and I can’t wait to listen to his music when it comes out.
SKY I LOVE YOU
Minecrof
Glad to see Sky again after all these years. He and Team Crafted raised a whole generation of Minecrafters. Those days will be missed.
E ITS DAN
dans a great father but let again he had practice raising 20 million others
I'm so happy and nostalgic that these guys are still having alive channels. I'm more happy they are ok with what work they do
I was really hoping you would get paulsoaresjr on the show. I used to watch him all the time.
Would you do an episode with the og cast of smosh? Some sort of reunion?
Where is pewds
>when you watched a ton of Minecraft growing up but it was only the Yogscast
i went to the DanTDM show in Adelaide and to this day, i still haven't bought a DanTDM hoodie   sad life
Sky has either gotten MORE chaotic, or his chaos has just shifted platform. Either way, I’m so happy for him
dantdm was my personality as a child
Hello? My childhood? You're back? Ok, but I still watch Lizzie, and my lil brothers watch Dan, BUT SKY? Ahhh, childhood
Where are Stampy and Squid ;(
Stampy should be here
my biggest flex was always that me and dan have the same bday!!
Amazing!
I'm so mad Stampy cat isn't on here

i miss adam so much omfg
Anthony, please do Techno, you did Dream so please do Technoblade      He's my fav, please, jk, not begging you or anything, just a suggestion
Ep 2
Dantdm 🔥🔥🔥
There is no understatement when I say that my childhood was amazing because of these people. Gosh I miss the old days :,)
i really like this background music lmao
My childhood
PLEASE DO ONE WITH LATE AUGUST, SAD-IST AND DERIVAKAT ALL IN THE SAME VIDEO
I love Lizzie she’s so great and sweet her videos just give the best ✨vibes✨
That clip of Sky’s ‘New World’ punched me in the face back into my childhood
Could you do a part 2 interviewing Bajancanadian, JeromeASF and SSundee?
I still go back and watch Adam's Minecraft videos. When I'm feeling down I watch to Try Not To Laughs, they always brighten up my day and make he laugh.
When Lizzie said ZackScottGames that gave me the Nostalgia
You forgot stampy
I absolutely love this Dan got me into Minecraft sky kept me there and Lizzie pushed me to keep going
Who remembers the time when Adam used to call "gold" as "butter"?
How awesome would it be to have a hermit craft based interview with like mumbo, xiuma, and some of the other hermits
Still a member of sky army
I like Albert
I’ve been watching Lizzie sense 2015 :0:0
JEEZ, I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS, I'M NOT SAYING THIS AN EXPRESSION, I LITERALLY SCREAMED DBBDBDB
Albert :D
petition for anthony to do a video spending the day with the mr beast crew!
Now THESE minecrafters... yes fricking sir
You should do Roblox youtubers
Bruh STAMPYLONGHEAD
K but how the hell did I not know that Post Malone lived with Team Crafted
my childhood in one video
15:21 “yes I’ve got this” best quote ever
"a secret on the tip of my tongue and on the back of my lungs" Still an emo at heart I see
We need Stampy on... it would be so interesting about how he felt during his rise and fall
has popularmmos been forgotten
o7 to all the og minecrafters than raised an entire generation.
Spend a day with exorcist
"Legendary OG Minecrafters"  I was so excited to see The Yogscast :(
Yooooooooo
Moment of silence for Dr. Treyaurus. He’ll be missed but never forgotten o7
Etho is my favorite og minecraft ytber. He still makes content which is great
LIZZIEEEE
Ngl slightly dissapinted that Captain Sparklez isn't here. No flak to the Cap or Anthony, coordinating is hard, just a lil sadge.
man why not popularmmos
imagine im in the comments then said "LDSHADOWLADY LDSHADOWLADY LDSHADOWLADY LDSHADOWLADY LDSHADOWLADY PLSSSSSSSSSS" then they talked about it like ldshadowlady is my favorite youtuber ok
Minecarft story mode I still remember it
Adam's energy has not changed and I love him for it
when you realize technoblade and badboyhalo are a part of the og minecraft scene
Maybe spent a day with  hermits please
lizzie my beloved <33
Maybe do one with Stampy and technoblade
Real ones remember ZackScott 2:06
Yo you should do a day with O2L that would be epic
Oh how I love you Adam
Nice
Out of these 3 I only watched DanTDM. Especially his mod videos. I'm kinda sad that Stampy isn't here tho
Sky is such a mood
I was really hoping popularmmos was gonna be here but I’m still grateful that I get to see this video😁
im glad sky/adam is doing great! i havent heard from him in a while
anyone else get the reference at 16:02 ? Bring Me The Horizon - Chelsea Smile
You should do a Minecraft Role play Youtubers also! (Just a suggestion:] )
can u please do female streamers that would be so good
LDSHADOWLADY WAS MY CHILDHOOD SINCE KINDERGARDEN AND SHE STIIL IS
Aw Skydoesminecraft. He's what got me into youtube in the first place. He was my first youtuber. I still love him dearly, and wont ever forget the laughs he brought me 💕💕💕
I can't believe someone would laugh at Lizzie for being the most amazing and incredible part of herself
these guys were my childhood, and till this day ldshadowlady is still my idol.
Should’ve got stampy
The fact that I watch all of the people here when I was growing up makes me happy
i cant believe SB737 is not in this video
Finding out sky lived with post Malone, what in the world 🤣
Yes I have been waiting for this
broooo wheres popularmmos and stampylonghead
there’s no minecraft youtuber  that i miss more then skydoesminecraft
Honestly was expecting TDM and definitely Skydoesmincraft but tbh i thought captain sparkles would too
0:31 That hardcore death 😣
Where is stampy
DANNNNNNN
Me thinking he was going to talk with stampy but this is more better
Anthony I think your gonna need to do this again. Where the heck is Grian? Or MumboJumbo
Lizzie still gets like 2mill views per video
Adam was cracking me up, oh my gosh. His humor hasn't changed and I love that
It’s a shame stampy wasn’t in this video but I’m sure Anthony asked stampy just refused :(
i love how adam decided to shoutout his dog instead of anything else
I DID NOT SPEND MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD WATCHING STAMPY CAT AND SQUID AND LEE AND SQUASHY  AND NOT HAVE THEM BE HERE
I am going to cry, Mr. Adam it's so good to see you
When was this made I wonder because sky went back and forth recently
BUTTER
Net and dan are my dads
Adams the best, always has been.
A legend interviewing a legend? neato
when i think of dantdm i also think of dr trayauras (i think that how you spell it) cuz he was in so many of his videos :>
Can we also appreciate the creator of minecraft notch imagine if he didn't invented minecraft
You should try and get stampy
Adam is so cute and looks so happy I’m so happy that he’s doing so much better now.
Poor CaptainSparklez not included
i love how lizzie and dan are talking about their friends, family, etc.  sky is literally just like *yes music and demons spiritually awake, a l b e r t*
Build battle dantdm i miss you
Where’s stampy
We needed popularmmos in this video
Dantdm mod reviews i miss them
Please do karl jacobsss i love him
It would be better if lizzy was ssunder
Team crafted 😔😔
The fact that I’ve been watching Lizzie for 7 or 8 years and Dan since for a while as well is just crazy for me to think about.
I wish you had paupolaromaos
Dan played a big part of my childhood. I’m so glad he’s still around and I miss his minecraft mod reviews. They were the only thing entertaining me when I was a kid. Lizzie too!
I was missing popular MMOs
LDshadowlady, DanTDM, Skydoseminecraft, Aphmau, and ITsfunneh where my childhood and they still are amazing.
That dr teryaurus mention hit different😭
I absolutely love LDShadowLady, no joke the day I discovered her channel my life changed💕
pls can u do a day with sidemen
How is popularmmos not on here?!
I’ve known of LDShadowlady since 2015 because of Joey Graceffa, now my little niece watches her 🥰
another awesome video Anthony <3
thank you for having Adam on here.
skys content rlly had an impact on my childhood n helped me thru a lot :) so happy to hear from him
This is epic seeing hearing their perspective being a yt content creator
i will never stop watching lizzie.
Anthony should do one where he interviews himself. "I spent a day with ANTHONYPADILLA "
hmm why is the "ur still around making videos" have the same pfp as me???
The nostalgia is unreal
I love Adam in this so much
I only know of Minecraft b/c my kid used to watch them and I'd listen or sometimes watch too; it's the reason I know who DanTDM, iBallisticSquid(spelling?) and Stampy Longnose are. When I saw this question on Twitter when I still had it, Dan was the first one I thought of...took me a while to remember the other two's names but I knew who I wanted to name.  Oh, she also used to watch i haz cupquake but she did different games including minecraft. That's my story lol.
I would’ve loved to see paulsoaresjr mixed in with these guys!!
Can we get a Version 2 of this with Captain Sparklez and Stampy??? Please???
This vid reminded me thzt only Sky and Ssundee can make me laugh this hard out of the mcyts😂😂
this video makes me so happy, anthony talking to these legends makes me so happy cause i grew up on all of them and it feels so surreal so much joy rn
Sky has so many people who think of him fondly. I would check out whatever he decided to release. He’s definitely got my view out of that 5 billion he’ll get.
I still watch them all today, the fact that I have this stupid smile on my face like I'm kid again. They made me so happy as kid and they're are huge inspirations for so many of us!
ANTHONY DO A PART 2 AND ADD STAMPY
Dan: I did a world tour.  Lizzie: I was in my story mode.  Sky: I bought a Lamborghini!
This is everything I've ever wanted
I've been watching Lizzie for 4-5 years and I'm not getting tired of her videos cuz she is entertaining lawl
you're the best
when i saw adam i was so happy i miss seeing his face and him laughing with his friends
Dan: I did a world tour.  Lizzie: I was in my story mode.  Sky: I bought a Lamborghini!
Does anybody know about Tiny Turtle and Little Lizard?
Sky does Minecraft was my childhood the cops and robbers was the best the Minecraft song too. My 7 year old self and my sister would just watch his videos for hours
Bro your talking to my childhood!!
I love how Lizzie is still content with where she is with Minecraft, and how makes videos, it makes me quite happy
Lizzzzzieee
My guy Dantdm
Where is ASFJerome and BajanCanadian?!?!?!? They are OG’s too!
Sky is on a whole other level
Part Two with Popularmmos, Stampy, and Banjan Canadian
How the hell is CaptainSparklez not here? JORDANNNN WHERE U AT
Anthony Creating the biggest collab on youtube lmao
is lizzie wearing a wig?
I wish popular mmos was here or stampy they were my childhood before i found Dan or butter fingers
YWSSSSSSSSS
its a shame pretty much all og minecrafters like ssundee and well yea dantdm converted to fricking fortnite and amoung us
Adam's energy in this video is honestly a vibe lmao
im nonbinary so i cant wait for the nonbinary episode
Dan: Shout out to Trayaurus Grim: *sad dog noises*
Dan was like my dad for a while, but now he has a son himself. That’s crazy.
Anthony plz add Aphmau in one of your next. Minecraft themed VIDEOS PLZ
i grew up on ldshadowlady (lizzie) it was great to see her in this
i think he also should've done stampy
I love how sky can say crazy shit and I will follow without question
Brb gon cry
Yooo jaidens coming soon let's go :D
Love Dan’s video since my childhood and now I still watch his video
I love LDShadowLady!!!
all these people ICONS
i miss team crafted
no, because I've watched Dan and Lizzie since I was like 8 or 9 and now I'm turning 18 like I grew up with them so watching this made me so happy !!!
If Dan still making video until his son able to play the game by himself, at that time I will be crying and also in my mid 20's or something,
Lol the era that sky was hanging out with Post Malone was called  Pre Malone
Technoblade next? Imagine?
I used to watch LIzzie and Joel and my little brother watched DanTDM, watching this takes me back haha
Love how humble sky is
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
man it’s so nice to see sky :))) i still watch dan and lizzie but i’m just really glad to hear sky like. talk idk
Y’all Lizzie came out as Bi the other day, help I’m so happy ;/;
Me: *still watches all of them and more*
Sad yogscast wasn’t there, oh well they are one of the real ogs
No SSundee, or PopularMMOs, or Stampy, CaptainSparklez, and more. We need a part two.
This video made my day and made me cry at the same time.
"wait your ALIVE?!?!"
ahh yes ni-HA-chu
Video idea: i spent a Day hours with Youtube Boxers
at this point in time, there is 69 dislikes       im not sure how  to feel
I’m glad Dan is still going strong even though he has his own family to take care of.
You should interview stampy if you can!  (individual video maybe) he's a big reason why minecraft was such a big thing!
Anthony would never be an OG YouTuber
Roblox YouTubers next ? Flamingo????
Can you maybe do some different OG Minecrafters?
NetNobody fka Sky was honestly my life through the ages of 10-15. The same goes for Dan and Lizzie those people are historical and iconic
The new mc gang should do some sort of tribute. It’s crazy to think these creators changed our childhood so much
Dan was my whole childhood so I fell so happy that he grew content wise
not all hero’s wear capes
What about thinknoodles or stampylonghead???
does anyone else remember heyimbee, stacyplays, amy lee, ihascupquake, and when joey graceffa played. Also vengelfe, vixella grazer, stampyplays plus more!!!
LIZZIE IS LEGIT MY CHILDHOOD
Dan was a huge part of my childhood I'm so excited he's still going strong and that he's a father✨
I can’t believe people stopped watching LDShadowLady I’m almost 18 and I’ve been watching her since I was 12 she’s an amazing creator
I kind of want a solo episode with you spending a day with PewDiePoe.
A little sad to not see ihascupquake or Mitch and Jerome, hope they’re all doing well too
Why did stampy not come on the show?? Stampy where you at?
Can you do some kind of video with Vanossgaming
this video made me realize I've been actively watching Lizzies content for 7 years
adam has not changed at all, loved that guy ❤️.
ive been waitin for this one! turn it up!
Adam really shit the bed How you gonna shit the bed? Alesa told me you were crying Nigga, this shit had me dying Had to clean up all your noodles I expect that from a poodle And you know the best part? Adam thought it was a fart
Hello
shoutout to the 69 dislikes
OH MY GOSH
The actual good minecraft youtubers
Hey anthony can you interview the tube family (evantubehd) because it is sad to see their downfall because their fans (especially me) is growing up
Where is popularmmos?
I’m genuinely so happy and excited to see Lizzie in this video i cannot even express it I know it seems exaggerated but im gonna cry lol
Adam is awesome
Adam was a huge part of my childhood. His videos never failed to make me laugh and feel better. I didn't used to watch Dan and Lizzie all that much, but sky, team crafted, and the office he made was my shiz growing up. I only used to watch him, Stampy, Iballisticsquid, and Aphmau.
ILL NEVER STOP WATCHING LIZZIE
So many hours..
pls do one with technoblade
You should try to talk to the Mianite guys
I'm actually a little sad I never watched Adam in the past. He seems like an epic dude.
OMG I CLICKED SO FAST WHEN I SAW LIZZIE SHES THE GREATEST IM SO GLAD YOU INVITED HER I hope more people see her because I watched her since middle school and I still do <3
Where is stampy
YO THE BMTH REFERENCE UGH love that he's a punk rocker
You have 5 seconds to promote anything you want.  This Albert 🤣🤣
I never knew about skydoesminecraft before this but honestly his personality is so entertaining. I’m sure he won’t need to worry about being held back by his Minecraft fame. He can make it back on his own based on personality alone
Lizzzzieeeee
I just relized this video was uploaded today
Love lizzeee
lizzie is literally my entire childhood, she literally shaped my childhood its so amazing seeing her on here 💖
Alright dudes set your watches for somewhere in September or October!
lizzie and dan: yeah minecraft is good adam: post malone, music, and demons
No popularmmos :(
spend a day wth hermits
LIZZIE MY YOUTUBE MOM MY CHILDHOOD MY QUEEN
i would love a part 2 with stampy🤧
Not even popularmmos 🥺🥺
You forgot Thinknoodles.
THANK YOU ANTHONY I WAS WATCHING THE OTHER MINECRAFT VIDEO YESTERDAY AND BURSTING WITH EXCITEMENT WAITING FORYOU TO UPLOAD
"AhhhHhh " -sky
But you forgot the REAL OG  Stampylonghead
Dan truly was apart of my childhood. Along with Markiplier and Matthias. They played such huge roles in my life and brought me so much joy xd and still do
Why wasn’t stampy in this 😭😭
I love all of these og youtubers but Sky is my most favorite and mostly watch youtuber
Ni-hah-chu
this makes me so happy
All of these people really made up my childhood  Edit: legit still go back to watch them sometimes just to relive my childhood it’s like going back to watch childhood cartoons I feel old now TvT
I watched popularmmos a lot and loved it, but then moved on to other channels. I went back to see what they’re doing today and Holy sh*t! A lot of things happened like Jen and Pat are broken up and other people are in their videos! I accepted it immediately but that made me feel weird that people I know can change drastically
Anthony: suck me, my blood out hard Me: I’m just gonna pretend I didn’t hear that and remember my childhood innocence
I'm kinda sad Stampy isn't in this but I don't think Stampy would even want to do an interview TwT either way I fucking love this this made me very happy and nostalgic but in a good way
lizzie calling out the shadow cadets 🥺
Now that you have done with Lizzie do with SmallishBeans
I asked for Sky and I still am surprised you got him haha
Man I remember watching Stampy on my iPod touch and my parents being so annoyed of his voice, and hiding watching sky as a kid because he swore in his videos 😂
I still watch the Og Minecrafters at this point and don't really watch the new ones
Albert
Man I love sky does Minecraft
Smosh was is one of the og YouTube channels. Anthony padilla is one of the og youtubers
Skydoesminecraft: i got popular because of        S  Q  U  I  D
Albert
OMG YESSSSSSS AHHHHHHH.... I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
WHAT THE WHAT SKY DOES MINECRAFT IS SO DIFFERENT I WAS SO HOPING HE WOULD BE IN THIS
Pls do a part 2
Peepee
The biggest minecrafter is pewdiepie!! (technically)
Nee-ha-chue HAIHJKGHKJGHAHBGHRGEAHUI
i was waiting for the new like goal for more of these interviews with Minecraft Youtubers  MORE PLEASE  suggestions: Captain Sparklez - OG Technoblade - Minecraft PVP Grian - Minecraft Building
You monster. How dare you not use Sky as the thumbnail!
Skydoesminecraft, Dantdm, & Ihascupqake. My Childhood.
anthony: what’s the biggest misconception about you?  both lizzie and dan: *swearing*
all three of them my childhood heroes, like i still go back and watch their old videos they bring me joy still after so many years
I teared up when I saw the title
Yoo
Imagine the OGs doing manhunt or something with the dream team😭😭 would make my whole year
Lizzie!!!
The intro reminded me of gta
I never watched Dan but I watched Lizzie and all her crazy craft friends and i always watched Adam and the old SkyMedia crew. Out of the SkyMedia crew I still watch Max and Ross till this day. They are my childhood and i still watch them all plus all the new mcyts.
Everyone: “talking about seeing there childhood hero’s “ Me: “There’s a bring me the horizon reference in there 👀 “
Seeing Adam smiling and laughing genuinely put the biggest smile on my face. I’ve been a fan since I was 8 years old. I’m gonna be 18 in a few months. It’s so insane to me. I can’t wait to hear the new music though! LA Lights will always be my fav
Who else remembers Diamond Dimensions??? 😭😭
Is sky okay 😂😂😂😂
LETS GOOOO
I wish you included Popularmmos and Gaming With Jen!
Sky has so much energy in this video!
I’ve been waiting for this for so long
Ldshadowlady and dantdm legit made me the person I am today, and I still love to go back to their channels in times where I seek comfort, the memories of it all are precious to me, and I wouldn’t have trade them away. I’m glad I had them
I love how Dan and Lizzie gave a shout-out to their fans and Anthony, but Adam gives a shout-out to his dog XD
I missed sky so much I watch his old content all the time it just gives me so much serotonin
bro all u needed was stampy
6:35 she's talking abt keeping online fame secret
I wanna hear DanTDM swear
Ohmygosh Dan 😭 this hurts
i ate a burrito vertically
Sky lived with fucking post Malone?????
I remember checking YouTube every day for Dan's uploaded I watched him pretty religiously back then, this is such a blast to the past
do smosh
LIZZIE 😭💕
Now going to rewatch Lizzies videos because *nastolgia*
And to think kids are watching Dream and whoever else instead of them. 🥲
SKY IS ON SOMETHING AND ID LIKE TO TAKE FIVE OF THEM
I haven’t seen Dan in so long. Literally i remember thinking he was so cute and he still is lmfaoo
This makes me tear up :,)
i’m crying, i hate to say this, because it seems so weird, but the tears are here, they were my childhood, and even my preteens and a little of my teen hood.
Can you do Valorant pros?
Honestly, Dan can get it
I honestly live for all of your videos. KEEP IT UP!!
Dude Lizzie is like a big sister to me lell I started watching her when I was 8 (6 years ago) and I don't remember a time where I got bored of her content. She's amazing and she deserves every inch of her fame and I cannot stress that further <3
DanTDM was literally the first YouTuber I subscribed, because back in the day he was my childhood.
ADAMMMMMM 😭😭😭
Seeing Adam is on here is honestly mind boggling I haven’t watched his content since idk but now I kinda see myself wanting to grow as an content creator and build what he build but in my own way.  See all the cc’s I used to watch is crazy I wanna make a mark and make others happy like they did :) mark my word ima make it. So uhhh hi my name is Rixxie and I’m a 17 year old content creator u can find me on twitch @ JustRixxie :)
My childhood :<
These all guys look way too different from my childhood. Time flies fast.
Yooooo skydoesMinecraft used to be my whole life I swear 😂
This does put a smile on my face. wait i just remembered i met ldshadowlady and dan. SKY HMU I NEED THE WHOLE SET
I have waited for this for so long also I wished you got either Popularmmos  or supergirlygamer because they were my childhood for minecraft
why isnt stampy here?
Proud to say that I have never stopped watching Lizzie
it’s so crazy to me that sky still acts the same like sure his content and goals have changed but like.... HE STILL KINDA ACTS THE SAME
Dude I remember watching Sky’s videos all throughout my childhood when he did the mod showcases and epic jump maps.I’d drift away sometimes and stop watching him, but I’d always come back. And despite how different the content becomes and the people he played with changing, he is just as bright and funny. I was so bothered after hearing about all the tough issues he was dealing with behind the scenes ,and I always hoped everything will be alright in the end. So happy to see him in a much better place!! Good luck with your music Adam!!!
Well dang. Now I’ve gotta watch all of Sky’s videos again
thanks for making this. it gives me nostalgia
How but popularmmos Stampy or PrestonPlayz
Would you ever do an interview with the new Smosh Members? Would be neat to compare and talk about experiences.
I cried watching this
IVE WATCHHED LIZZIE AND DAN FOR 10 YEARS NOW AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SO GLAD THEY ARE IN THISSS
Anthony man chill
Adam such a chad. We support
The guy that lived w post malone, looks like post malone
god i missed sky
I became a fan around 12-13 and got my first phone and got active around 16-18 DanTDM is the best and my childhood hero!!
If you think about it the top Minecraft Youtubers rightnow grewup watching these guys we tommyinnit grewup watching people like DanTDM and even Ranboo saying he grewup watching people like captainsparkles which is also an OG Minecraft Youtuber
Stampy anyone?
Adam still makes me laugh after all these years.
What about stampy? :(
is it just me or is lizzie wearing a wig??
me being obsessed with sky and his content as a kid was what connected me to my first proper friend in year 5 and honestly without him I don’t know if I would have ever been able to make friends like I did
I'm having a nostalgia blast
This collab is my childhood-
i can’t wait for netnobody content though!
This makes me so happy
Adam is still so funny lmao
I fr learned English with sky’s vids lmao, thanks bro
My childhood right here💀😭
Dan, LDShadowLady, Stampy and StacyPlays were my OGs 😩!!!
.
Adam seems to be in a much better headspace now and not like how he was during the drama.
My childhood is in this video (minus PopularMMOs, Aphmau, and a few other people)
When Dan mentioned dr trayourous I started to cry 😭
They literally raised me better than my parents ever did-   :’)
Dude I was around in the challenge Colosseum videos when I watched DanTDM
Damn these people were a huge part of my childhood. Some of Sky's joke's I still reference and DantTDM was the first channel i subbed to ><
I thank you Anthony, you let me see my childhood once again and as an OG I loved this video. Question of the day/video, how many of yall remember Cops and Robbers, Modded Adventurers, and The Diamond Dimensions? haha
i used to love lizzie because she used to be diverse with g mod, the sims, cod and more random silly games but when i look at her channel now its mostly minecraft and more centred around kids, she had to change it up and be pg with no swearing and i just felt like she wasnt being herself anymore and just going for a certain target audience such as kids, its great to see how much she has grown though and i do believe she deserves it :)
Holy shit I grew up on DanTDM
Y’all remember stampy long legs and the squid guy??
Can you do a video on legally blind people if has some misconception
Omg IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 😍😍
Petition to spend a day with Jawed
OG Minecrafters   Me: stampy and popularmmos where?
I’ve NEVER stopped watching Dan. He and many others were my entire childhood but Dan always stuck with me. Idk why. Well, I began evolving and watching the dsmp and when Tommy and Dan collabed it was so weird. My childhood and current life were colliding and it was so fun and cool and amazing. I just hope these people realize how much they raised me and I hope the current mcyts realize how many lives, including mine, they have saved.
Does anyone know why Lizzie is wearing a Wig? I don’t care if it’s a secret, just curious as I heard it became orange for a moment then it was back to more chill, the wig appeared after that
They should make a smp with them for nostalgic youtubers
Where's Stamps?
Little Kelly or little Carly anyone
should've interviewed aphmau as well, she is an og as well
I feel like Sky viewers tend to gravitate towards SMP Live more
Bro, I miss watching skydoesminecraft. When I watch his content now it's all nostagia and back to the pass
I saw Sky and that was enough
Finally LDSHADOWLADY MY FAV YOUTUBER AAAH LESSGOOO
I saw the first part of the title and was hoping Popularmmos would be in it
I would have liked to see popularmmos but sadly I don't think it was gonna happen since he is in alot of drama right know
I would just like to say, these people literaly raised me, if I think of my childhood, I think of them. so thank you, for playing a huge part in my childhood :)
i literally love lizzie sm omg <33333333
Adam: demons and car go vroom vroom and suddenly Albert
Lizzie is just the best
I was watching Dan with my brother on like our nintendo ds, when my mam comes in and asks "what r ye watching?" my brother says dantdm, she asks what type of stuff does he do? .... he says he reviews minecraft mods like the knife and gun mod.... yeeeeeaaaah... safes go say I wasn't allowed on the ds for a while...
Wow, all three of them were my absolute childhood.
we use to have team crafted, instead now we have jake paul's team 10.
god the nostalgia...i used to watch DanTDM minecraft story mode and his roleplays with Dr.Tresaurus (i think) AND  Sky playing with Ross, barney, Max, etc doing games on minecraft, having fun, doing the breakfast club (BACON MAN) XD god it takes me back down memory lane
i started watching lizzie when i was 8 and now im 18.
Oof Dan and Padilla ,epic!!!!!!!!!!!
These people made my childhood
I wish Stampy would have been here as he was probably someone we all watched as kids
How about Stampy?
One of my favorite videos on this channel
is lizzie wearing a wig ??? cause its the only thing im looking at
I adore Lizzie sm pls :(
anyone remember when we all have skyarmy instead of bts army ???
i can only imagine the look on my 10 year old face if i told them in 2021 there would be a collab with Anthony Padilla, DanTDM and SkyDoesMinecraft i think they're brain would actually flatline
og smosh was my childhood, yall had minecraft i had foodbattles… i really miss it /lh
Wheres Stampy tho?
ALL BETTER THEN DREAM
Just hearing Adam’s voice puts such a huge smile on my face
I think Adam was high during this lol
I see DanTDM andSkydoesMinecraft,they’re my childhood sorry guys also I enjoyed them both so much especially this youtuber! Who else agrees?❤️❤️
I'm surprised captainsparkle isn't there
YOOOOOO  POGG
cupquake should have been in this video
I love Albert
I saw Skydoesminecraft and immediately clicked
LIZZY!!!!
these people literally raised me its so crazy to hear how it was so negative for them but so positive for us
This video IMMEDIATELY made me feel so happy and so comfortable, idk how to explain it but childhood me is screaming
omg i remember bacon man
I’m glad to see sky seeming better he deserves everything good in this world <3
I MISS SKY SO MUCH AAHH
You should do a video of how it’s like to be a young content creators for example Tommy, tubbo, Ranboo, lizzyypixel, and lanusky!
i wish i had as much confidence as sky does with his music
bro imagine he got bo burnham on here
I kinda felt so bad for sky honestly I’ve been watching his life as a kid since now and honestly he has gone through the worst things imaginable. I honestly blame his ex’s, keemstar, and YouTube for ruining his life
Thanks to them they broke YouTube multiple times with their billion views
These people are literally some of the people that raised a lot of us during our childhood. I’m so grateful to have grown up with these absolute legends and I’m glad they still make some form of content:,)
SKY!
I wish there were more peeps like antfarm or ihascupquake T.T
So post malone lived with skydoesminecraft and then ethan from h3h3???
What about etho :/ he’s a pretty private guy more private than dream
Been subbed to dan since before 10k
16:02 I love that reference
I AM FOING TO CRY
You should do a Video where you spend a day with Maladaptive Daydreamers. It would help me to know I'm not the only one!
Lol skydoesmincraft got destroyed by ksi
NO wayyyyy
YALL really dont know how much i love LdShadowlady
They have my full respect.They made my childhood unforgettable the amount of time and effort they put into their videos for us is insane!
DAAAAAAAAAN
you should interview technoblade
I really hope Sky's doing alright..
The first video Adam uploaded after I subscribed was his quitting video...
PLEASE DO I SPENT A DAY WITH BO BURNHAM
I literally absorbed DanTDM's accent. I watched him all the time when I was 7 and I loved him so much. I still mention him regarding my voice to this day, and I still love Lizzie and Sky. These 3 were my top influences, I love them so much.
ihascupquake thoooooo
Not me almost about to cry😭🙂🥰🥰🥰
Love Adams energy lmao
17:34 legit techno is really good even tho his content is whenever he wants to, but I also respect those who put a lot of time and effort into their content like TommyInnit, I kinda prefer more one person makes their own content, idk it's personal preference. But I want to edit my own content, but my god do I not know how to use a computer,   Also SKY IS SO DAMN COOL I DID CRY BC I DID AND HE STILL CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE ME LAUGH
Oof, Anthony could've spoken with Ssundee aka Ian
My childhood! It’s nice to check up on them and see their still making great things
bro why not phil
i just got thrown back to when i was a kid. thank you, i’ve missed
I remember their old videos and I still watch them!
Man do an episode with ian pleasssseeeeeee
How is sky still the funniest part of any video
Congrats to LDShadowLady for still going strong! I'm honored she shouted me out, and I too get the comments of how people used to watch me.
I love Adam, he’s a good guy and I hope he does well
SkyDoesMinecraft was my childhood. I can’t imagine me living my childhood without him. I support NetNobody and i always will. I love you, i always will, you’ll always be the greatest in my heart
Let’s gooooo DanTDM
Philza where’s Philza?
Hey you left out Ssundee can you plz get him and some of his friends like Jerome and Crainer?
I clicked FAST when I saw LDShadowlady
i love how everytime at least one person shouts out Anthony and hes always so surprised they did so
Video suggestion: I spent a day with Paranormal Investigaters. Try to invite Zak Bagans Please, or someone from Ghost Adventures.
But like what happened to stampy and his lovely world
this is just my childhood
ldshadowlady
I spent a day with HERMITCRAFT MEMBERS ??? Anyone?
Heyyyy
We will forever remember Jail Break with Sky and Dan's lab. Good times.
i love lizzie and i still watch her and have been for like 5 years
never thought my favorite youtuber would be mentioned. zackscottgames <3
This video hit so hard with nostalgia it was so nice seeing Adam, Lizzy, and Dan :,D
I always thought that trayaurus was talking and i refuse to believe otherwise
Popularmmos
not to brag but i have a signed ldshadowlady poster in my room lmao
Hello I am a Filipino There is a famous Filipino in the Philippines that he's last name was Padilla and the real pronounciancion of Padilla is............................
This is literally my childhood in one video lol
I've been watching Lizzie for 7 years now she is my idol and I love her videos they always make me laugh 😂❤️
I spent a day with the cast of smosh
Ahhhhhhh SKYDOESMINECRAFT THAT SHIT WAS MY CHILDHOOD 😭💕
Lizzie, you're still my favorite and I still watch your videos.For me, you're the best! ily<3
I swear these people raised me as a kid. The fact that i've been playing minecraft for almost a decade is genuinely crazy, and ill be an adult so soon. Time sure flies.
It's the man, the myth, the legend -- SkyDoesMinecraft! AH!
Im sad popularmmos isnt here
I never will forget LDShadowLady, she has been my idol for the last 10 years and helped me get through a really hard time in life to the point of reaching out in dms to give me hope.
Can you do part 3 :)))
Lizzie's humour is just the best, and her content will never die, also add that the fact that she's crazy and weird Anyways mad respect for the OG minecraft youtubers!!!
Bruh. Why isn’t popularmmos and stampy here?
You need to do a part 2 with Captiansparklez
I still remember dans adventures with dr t, like the pirate adventure and the one where they go back in time. I never realised those were mods until later, and I always tried to make villagers talk or do stuff like dr t could do.
CAPTAIN SPARKLEZ
OMG YES
WE MISS YOU SKY!!!♡
DR. TREYAURUS!!!
is it me or does Sky look so much happier? I miss you bro but you do you Sky <3
I love dan how humble he is and he still hasn’t changed! Thank you for being my childhood and still being part of my life until today
lizzie had a asthetic crisis geez    she went punk to soft
Tbh u don't know the relief I felt when lizzie said she was gonna keep doing videos her way. At first the new style of mc vids was fun but now to me personally it feels overwhelming and overused and I would b sad to watch another mc youtuber I love fall into that trend (the only person I can stand doing the new style is the person I first saw use it >.<)
I used to watch all of these youtubers. It's crazy to see how far they've gotten! <3
My brother was one of the people who showed me who sky was back in 2013 from there I grew up with Minecraft youtubers.. one of the greatest moments of my LIFE
AAAAA SKYYYYY MY MAN HOW ARE U OMGGG you guys, I missed him so much
I can’t express how happy I am to see Sky again, he was such a huge part of my childhood. I’m glad to see him doing good these days 💜
adam is just vibing and i’m living for it
Anyone remember Popularmmos and Gaming with Jen
"Dr Treyaurus" at the end there caught my eye
Adam in this video is- the definition of fun
Back in the days where there's no cringy stan's
where captainsparklez
Adam will forever be my favourite YouTuber. Also that minecon clip he is a total dilf I live for it
shadowcraft.
Even after Minecraft- I fuccin love Adam’s music- excited for September/October for that music
YEAH MUSIC >:D -Adam OMFG I LOVE ADAM
Hearing Adams voice again made my heart melt
I just thought yesterday Anthony said he would spend a day with OG minecrafers , and there we go today we have this !!!
Was really hoping to see popular mmos
“I expect people to move on” -Ldshadowlady Me after still being subscribed since 2013: 👁👄👁
Its sad to see that Dream is gonna take DanTDM's spot on being most subscribed Minecraft youtuber soon.
This is my favorite video
lowkey sad stampy wasn't in this :')
13:22 SOME HOE SAID ‘wait your ALIVE?!?!’ IM DEADDD
Really wish stampy was in this
I’m so happy Lizzie is in this video!! She deserves it so much💙💙
definitely should’ve had stampy as well as lizzie and dan. those three literally shaped my childhood
You literally can tell who is still a streamer or content creator just by the video quality
I’m so thankful to these people. I hope the younger generation of minecrafters enjoy watching them as much as I did
My childhood- IM NOT CRYING MY EYES ARE JUST COSPLAYING A WATERFALL-0
Absolute banger man. I've been waiting for this video. Keep up the good work Anthony!
Man good to see Adam and seeing how hyperactive he is
For me SkyDoesMinecraft, DanTDM and CaptainSparklez was a big part of my childhood they definitely help me a lot during rough times so it was great seeing what Sky has been up to as of late.
LIZZIEEEE OMGGG
awww my inner child is screaming rn thank you i also loved ihascupquake!!!
where da Frick is STAMPY
i wish for stampy
Im watching my childhood right now.
I'm not used to seeing anyone but Lizzie's face so this was so weird for me lol
That awkward moment when you're a teenage girl and you realize you have the same shirt as skydoesminecraft
Yo, where's the love for CaptainSparklez? He is/was easily on par with these guys as one of the biggest OG Minecrafters.
Good old days
it's so nice to see Adam/sky. He, along with you and Ian, were my childhood and I watched every single video he released as soon as I noticed it was out. sky is actually the reason I wanted to play MC (along with the yogscast) and to this day I owe a lot of my humor and love of MC to him
Why is Adam literally insane and hilarious
lizzie will always hold a special place in my heart
Love the video
Lizzie was the first and longest Minecraft youtuber I watch. I love her videos so much. I’m glad she was part of this video and categorized as a legendary OG Minecraft youtuber
LDSHADOWLADY
i was feeling really nostalgic at the beginning of the pandemic and after watching lizzie’s videos for the first time in a few years, i got recommended one of dreams youtube videos and it restarted my love for minecraft again lol
dan was one of the first mcyt i've watched. he's one of the most humble and genuine people on this platform and still has the same heart of gold he's had from the beginning. i love how his content has gone from very childish, fun, and bubbly to more mature but still entertaining. he knows his viewers and he knows we're growing up too. i've watched him since i was 8/9, and now i'm going into my second year of high school. it's crazy even thinking about how much this dude has impacted millions us so positively.
Seeing Sky, Dan and Lizzy in Anthony's video is crossover I didn't know it will happen
Wish there was popularmmos
"Legendary OG Minecrafters"  Me: * also thought of Stampy *
hahaha adam is so fuckin weird i love it
7:26 I remember way back during SkyMedia, I asked Adam this exact question but his answer all those years ago was the answer that Dan gave just after Adam said his answer xD, what the heck hahaha 😆😆😆
To be honest, Dan and Lizzie were my childhood and always made me happy when I was bored : )
Honestly kinda disappointed that Stampy Cat and Captain Sparklez weren’t in the video 😔
it would be cool if he made a video with more dreams mp members except people like george, sapnap, and maybe badboyhalo sonce he already did dream alone.
Anthony should be a talk show host. He asks all the right questions and laughs when needed and sympathetic when needed.
I miss Dr Trayaurus😪
I’m actually convinced all popular YouTubers know each other at this point, its not a joke anymore 0_0
i love dan, he did not make my childhood he was my whole childhood :) i love him so much.
I miss when Adam and Team Crafted  know there are used to play they really built my childhood and it means it’s awesome to see how they evolved in a way
I used to have a lot of respect for Adam, but he treated a vast majority of his staff at SkyMedia like absolute garbage. It's difficult to watch this and reminisce about the good when all I can remember is the bad when it comes to Adam and his old videos.
Ok why is captain missing
Dan Lizzie and Adam!!!!!!
Anthony gained like 400k subs from this video alone 😂
YOOOO.... THE VIDEO IS HERE!!! :D
Is it me or did this dude not bring the OG popularMMOS?
I saw lizzie and then the title and said "YES"
nihachoo
20:55. “This is Albert!”  Lmao I love that XD
Dan and lizzie were my childhood and helped me at my lowest. I've been watching them since I was 7 or 8 so almost 9 years. I still watch Lizzie today and go back to Dan from time to time. Its so nice to see they haven't changed and I can aways feel at home and forget the stress in my life I doubt any of you two will see this but I just want to thank you from the bottom of my (cold) heart 🖤
this just made my day
pls do i spent a day with youtube musicians
Do a colab with jelly slogo and crainer please
I love ZackScott so much.
you don’t understand how much skydoesminecraft i watched as a kid
Alt title: everyone's childhood in a single video
No way..
A Tommyinnit laugh left my body when you said "Cuz sometimes existing is exhausting." lol
My brother named my dog after DanTDM  he was obsessed with Dan. Dan and lizzie were my childhood.
this has to be my all time favorite video of yours that you've done. these three were my childhood, they practically raised me. it's nice being able to see them grow and succeed all from making some videos because it was fun. thank you anthony padilla formerly from smosh (it's good to see you grow and succeed as well, you were also a huge part of my childhood) :) <33333
Man one time my mom yelled at me for watching Dan tdm
Video idea: I spent a day with iconic/ everyone knows them Minecrafters   Examples: Technoblade, Grian, Mumbo Jumbo and aphmau
Stopped breathing when i saw dantdm on the thumbnail
Were not sure why you dindt invite pat&jen.
Okay so who was gonna tell me that DanTDM was so fine???
I've been waiting sooo long for LDShadowlady to be on here
so not deadlox huh
love to see adam as unhinged as ever lol
let me tell you I screamed
No CaptainSparklez? ok
Stampylonghead should 10000% done this video too, he's my fav OG Minecraft creater!
Literally my childhood
Yeaaaaaaa skydoseminecraft he is the best
I love ldshadowlady so much, she LITERALLY saved me from myself, I don't know where I would be right now if I hadn't started watching her videos.
Adam pretty much founded my sense of humor. I will always be grateful to that man and wish him the best.
I grew up watching sky, and knowing the dark times and shit he went through, I’m glad to see him laugh and joke again :)
I started watching mcyt in 2015 HAHAHA i loved this
LIZZIEEEEE
what freakin nostalgia. Adam and Anthony, holy shit
i love dan sm ):
Sky is the fucking Minecraft Legend! Never forget the butter!!!
LDSHADOWLADY KS MY FAVORITE FUCKING LADY IN THE DAAMN WORLD THATS PERFECT TELL HER THAT
Where tf is stampy
captainsparklez :(
I remember when I was 6 thinking trayourus was really talking 💀😭 what a simpler time that was  please idk how to spell ik
I like how the whole time dan and lizzie was being wholesome and nostalgic about it while sky was just talking about music and and going vroom vroom
I wish popularmmos was in this video but it's still good 😪
A day with nintendo youtubers?
ive always been a fan of lizzie !! now ive a fanpage for her and ive met the nicest people :))
I'm surprised on how Lizzie didn't mention being married to Joel mostly because of Minecraft 😆
awww lizzie shouted out joel :,(((
Dan and Lizzie: yeah minecraft basically started my career  Adam: *DEMONS*
Nostalgia trip?
dan tdm was my childhood
I love how sky hasn’t changed
I remember in like, 2017, my brother went to a DanTDM meet and greet when he was like 14 and he said that everyone else was 10-12 yrs old. ;—;
wtf, sky is friend with post malone, no wonder post malone is so damn cultured
I’m so glad I had the chance to grow up with Lizzie and Dan.  Absolutely amazing
Anthony doesn't just interview ppl he slowly tells his story through it
Adam's vibin
*sigh* imma head off and rewatch all of sky’s videos brb
legit skydoesminecraft legit raised me
When do we get an episode with technoblade
Where is Captain sparkles
Im so excited for the Jaiden Animations episode! I love her so much!
Honestly, without Dan my life wouldn’t even be the same- he’s the reason I’m where I am today.
DanTDM not showing his kid's face is the smartest move I've ever seen a YouTuber do regarding their child. Like most family YouTubers nowadays exploit their kids into content once they're born
ive missed adam
seeing dantdm here made me emotional
i remember a year or two ago, i checked up on adam to see how he was doing. he opened up about a lot of mental health issues, backstabbing, and substance abuse, and it made me very sad thinking about how my childhood and former source of entertainment was in such a dark place. im very glad to see him doing better and doing what he wants.
Sad you weren't able to get Stampy in for the interview. He made so many people's childhoods. But Dan and Lizzie were a huge part of mine too, and it was awesome to hear from them!
I remember how much they meant to me, I still watch their stuff and own their merch. I'm glad they've grown and become the people they are today, but they'll always be the ones that raised me. ❤️❤️❤️
I'm surprised Sparklez isn't here. i know he's incredibly busy so I get it. I wonder if he'll be in a "youtube founders" kinda video with people who have been there since the beginning and kept going
My Childhood is here
where tf captain sparklez
this makes me so happy;-;
I was hoping CaptainSparkles would be on here.... He is one of the only people that I really like other than Sky.. and he still makes really good content. My Childhood is just all right here lol. I'm 20 years old now and I still go back and get excited watching the old content. lol
whenever i’m feeling sad i always go back and watch crazy craft or mod reviews that i watched when i was little
Who remembers PopularMMOS
i smiled so hard seeing sky, he will forever be one of my favorite youtubers
Man I still remember when I first found adam and it sucked me into dan and lizzie's content years later
DanTDM had a huge impact with my childhood, Dan is the reason why I love minecraft. Everytime I see Dan I get memories of my childhood. I still remember most the characters like Craig the mail man. Thanks Dan for having a huge impact of my life!
ah yes, the people who raised me when my parents didn’t want to. the people who made my childhood so much better than what it would’ve been if i didn’t know them.
Man I’m 15 now and haven’t missed a video from Lizzie
I may cry
Spend a day with roblox youtubers, and do flamingo!
Ah... I remember when I was 8. And I watched DanTDM's mod showcases. And Sky's cops and robbers. I miss those days.
U missed our Captain
15:00
where Popularmmos ?
didn’t know sky made music
Ah yesss LIZZIE
this has become my favorite video ever
Now do legandary OG Apex legends players
when dan tdm mentioned the world tour i had a flashback where i was actually there lol
This video has swelled my heart with so much joy! I was very choked up seeing all 4 of my favorite childhood(and current) creators❤️
I’m hoping to see ihascupquake
so glad to see sky :)
Dan & Liz: It’s really enjoyable, what I do and I’ll keep doing it and I love what’s come out of it!  Sky: QUANTUM SUPER DEMONS ARE REAL AND THEY F**KED MY WIFE. PEWDIEPIE HAS SUCKED EVERYONE’S BLOOD.
Lizzie's formula for a Minecraft video honestly works so well, seeing as though I've been watching her since her gmod days and I'm now in college continuing to await her every upload and stream.
Shoutout to those who remember that one Skype call in Skydoesminecraft’s block hunt series. Those were the best days
these are the Giants whose shoulders modern Minecraft YouTubers are standing on
‘Dantdm was my childhood’ you’re still a child bruv
I loved this video please make more! :D
I’ve watched Lizzie since the beginning and oh girllll I know she swears lmao 😭😭
If i was getting a bit bored of your content, after watching that DanTDM, my favourite youtuber of ALL time, u have enchanted me again. LMAO
When you still watch all of their contents after 10 years of knowing them❤️
I didn't watched them before but I know that they're the big mc YouTubers before. What I don't know is how chaotic sky does minecraft is
We need team crafted back
DanTDM raised so many of us while we were kids
Thought Philza Minecraft was gonna be in this vid haha, think u can invite him for some Minecraft vid?, he’s the guy who died in his 5 year hardcore world plsssss
I actually remember these people as a non minecraft player ive seen a bit
THE CLASSICS <3
Seeing Adam again after so long is so nostalgic :'))
I used to get back from school, run upstairs to the family computer, and watch dantdm, popularmmos, and stampy
these people were our guardians on the internet
Kinda missed Captainsparklez here but sadly he never quite reached the same level of fame as these three
Oh my God hearing SkyDoesMinecraft voice again literally brings back all the best memories I had in my childhood🥲
This would be so much lovelier if *he* participated.
There should DEEEEEEEFINITELY spend a day with beauty/cosmetics youtubers such as Simplynailogical!!
Bro sky is just now a big ball of mystery and confusion haha like with that last part
sky and dan were my childhood man
When I say this it was 2am and I screamed I need help I'm fucking crying
You should do roblox
THESE MFS WALKED SO THAT TOMMYINNIT AND DREAM SMP COULD RUN
okay where tf is Stampy
Ssundee, Ihascupquake what about those people lol
technoooblade next hmmm?
Every time I saw sky I just thought of gold ingots
im very suprised pat and jen werent on here either lmaoo
This here is big boys talk children don't understand.....
Thanks, now my girl is jamming Bring Me The Horizon
I didn’t watch to much Minecraft youtubers back in the day. It was the occasional DanTDM and religiously watch PopularMMOs
DanTDM nostalgia hitting rn never forget Craig The Mailman cause we haven't seen him in 5 years
RIP smallishbeans
Dantdm is one of the best og minecraft youtubers glad he's in this
Skydoesminecraft was my favorite person when he started Minecraft till he quit and I still love him man!! He is such a genuine person and probably the funniest youtuber I will ever watch honestly (: we can’t wait to hear your music Adam!
I love sky so much i still rewatch his old content im also kinda lost as where he had been and im so curious
i've been watching ldshadowlady ever since i was six. I loved her vids so so so much, and I'll always be subscribed to her. she was pretty much the only youtuber i watched for a very long time, and she'll always be a big part of my life (in a not creepy way). if i was bullied at school, or simply had a bad/long day i'd always watch her vids. love her <3
Anthony, you spelt Trayaurus wrong but whatever it doesn't matter.
NO, LIZZIE DID NOT JUST MENTION ZACK'S MINECRAFT SERVER 😭😭😭😭 SHE DIDN'T
I'm so glad Adam's in this video
Nice one!
cark_irl is my favorite minecraft youtuber
YEAAA
Ah Adam. Hope you're doing well man. Got fucked by life so hard and didn't deserve it at all
I hope adam is doing well
Had no idea Sky hung out with Pre-Malone
Donde esta vegetta
I would love for you to do one on color blindness and also give them a pair of those glasses that they must wear for the first time while being interviewed. also I'm color blind and it's such a small amount of color blindness that it basically is not anything but every so often I do get reminded about it when I'm looking at things. but it's basically like how you see in the dark and you put two colors next to each other like blue and purple they might be hard to distinguish at first but after you stare at them for a little bit you can tell which one is which, except that's how it is in the daytime for some colors for me.
This video gives me so much nostalgia-
no way :0
we’re just not gonna acknowledge that sky LIVED WITH POST MALONE 😳
the fact ldshadowlady is here makes my heart very very happy :)
Lizzie literally made me feel safe and comforted when I was little because I didn't have the best childhood and Dan was also a huge comfort for me and made me laugh and forget about things  They both gave me my love for minecraft that I still have today
This is the episode I’ve been waiting for
my childhood omg
/(•.•)\
Where is Stampy 😢
Adam is going to be the “POST MALONE WAS A MINECRAFTER??” For the next generation
someone is missing.. or rather a duo...
"i was living with the rest of team crafted and post molone"
Get Stampy on here damnit
Lol the mirror is just a green screen and he ha to talk to himself
I chased sky does Minecraft at mine con and I’m proud
I used to be obsessed with Sky, I had a girl version of his skin, called gold butter, and I met so many girls with a different girl version of him. It was such a good time, so nostalgic thinking about it. It took me 2 years after he stopped posting for me to change it
i love these three, not past tense cause i still love them even if i dont really look at their new content, at least not often. amazing creators.
I knew Adam would be willing to do this. :) Fun video! I used to watch Lizzie back around 2014, I think. I stopped for some reason, but her videos were enjoyable, along with Joel. I’ve been watching Adam since the beginning; I still am and always will. He’s mah boi, y’know. Also, I love his chaotic energy in this. xD Different story with Dan; I tried watching him many years ago, but all he made was Minecraft mod review videos and I wasn’t into that. I think he’s nice, though. :]
When i had my minecraft phase when I was a kid, I met a bunch of team crafted and others and I met adam and he was really sweet to me. I gave him a photo i drew of him and he recognized it said that he had seen it before online and he really appreciated my artwork. My lil ol middle school heart was so happy
Damn, if only popluarmmos was on there
I'm so excited for interviews with aromantic people 🥺
anthony is so humble I forget that he is literally from the legendary og youtubers
Sky seems a little unhinged 👀
I still think its crazy I used to hang out with lizzie and my brother when they were in college
stampy cat should be in here
spend a day with ssundee would be awesome
BAJAN CANADIAN DELETED HIS VIDEOS!! 😭😭😭😭
Words can't describe how much I love lizzie she's so cool, and I'm so glad she's in the video
Were is part 2 with popularmmos  and stamps
Yesss this is content I didnt ask for but I needed thank u Padilla!!
LDShadowlady was my childhood
Id like to see one with aphmau
Sky seems so happy and i love it The last time i heard of him was when he had that drama glad to see him better
You should of done stampy bro
DanTDM!!!!!! is my childhood
Sky is infinitely better than p*wd*ep*e
I miss Adam...
i wish stampycat was here he was such a big part of my childhood
I still watch Lizzie
What would be cool is if you added Stampy
Lizzie and Dan: shouts out people who made them grow in their content and as a person Adam: *albert*
it's nice to see that Sky seems to be doing better like he seems to be in a better place mentally and i'm honestly really happy for him!!
Lizzie my beloved <3
Anthony Padilla used nostalgia! It was super effective!
Lizzie and Dan: shout out to our fans Adam: so this is albert
8:47 I- I started watching Dan in 2016, he was the first mcyt I watched and I’ve shifted around who I watched but I never left the fandom, I’ve lived through the drought but I didn’t even know it at first
I give these kids props, i played minecraft for about 4 hours and was so bored i never played again. So to give content for 8 plus years is insane
Skydoesminecraft was definitely the best.
Can you interview Youtubers that became famous as a kid? Like EvanTube?
My childhood, I miss it…
Anthony Padilla is the best modern talk show host.
Adam has changed so much but at the same time he hasn’t at all. He’s still got the same smile, same infectious laugh and same fantastic vibe, it’s comforting considering he was my entire childhood.  Thanks Adam, I can’t wait for your music career to just sky rocket in popularity!
stampy :(
This video is gold
All their missing is  Bajan Canadian
Gosh i used to love sky does minecraft and all his friends
my childhood is back
Wish Stampy was in this video, he was the first mc YouTuber I watched. He was so wholesome
This is completely ironic, I was just watching Skydoesminecraft old videos and now this... It's a sign :o
Having stampy in here too would’ve been so dope
My childhood/my still watched by me YouTubers
Wish Bajan Canadian was on this episode
Ah too bad Ihascupquake isnt on this
Damn, was hoping to see someone I actually watched back in the day, but there were so many different circles haha
WAIT….   DAN HAS A KID!!!???!!
Who else seen these Youtubers when you were younger?  (Comment if you seen some of these youtubers)
I remember watching all these videos in my childhood, they all helped me immensely on who I am today.
The way he said NiHAchu
I wish pat and jen were here. They’re also legends but they never do stuff like this😭
But where is PopularMMOS
Like lizzie was the reason I LEARNED ENGLISH Its my second language and I only understood the basics but then I stumbled upon her channel and ENGLISH just CLICKED now I'm best at grammar in class thankyou so much 😊
LIZZIE IS MY CHILDHOOD <3
I hope this video blows up they need to come back. Todays youtube is awful
Dan and Lizzie raised me :]
Dr, Treyaurus will always live in my mind rent free
Do a video with satanists because we r misunderstood and you did videos with gypsies, Mormons and other religious groups
I used to love all of these guys, I watched Scottland w Scott and Lizzie and the rest way back in the day as well as the others
God I missed Adams voice and his jokes 😫 I miss him so much 🥺🥰
ngl anyone else hoping to see Popularmmos in this?
should of got stampylongnose and iballisticsquid 🛐
skys "New world" was a banger
i have not missed a lizzie upload since i was 6 i’m not even joking i am 15 now :)
Bro who else saw this video and went “finally…….the heroes have been recognized, our childhood is fulfilled.”
When I was un 4th grade, in art class we had to make a pillow and decorate it with paint and one of my classmates made a DanTDM design lmao
if I didn't watch these three I wouldn't be able to even write this comment
the real og be like: TEAM CRAFTER??
If stampy and squid was here oh my
OMG LIZZIE IM FREAKIMG OUT
If you ever do a video with more classic minecraft YTers, I think you should totally try and get Ssumdee on here.
I remember Aphmau, Sky, Barney, Ross and the other guy I forget lol. They were the people who were literally my childhood. I remember when Aphmau was at her peak making her role play videos and now she’s different but that’s ok. I’ve loved on from her channel.
I'm a fan of ldshadowlady since kingdom craft and One life 1.0   Rip Lizzie
THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY OMG
Sky definitely shaped my sense of humor when I was 11-12. Him and his group would make me laugh and wheeze for hours, especially with his try not to laugh series. I can see why I have such crackhead humor now. Thanks for laughs Adam!
Kinda wish aphmau was here I’m pretty sure she helped this generation too! But I love Lizzie so much
This is a day I never thought I would see in my existence
Holy shit Sky! Hope he's doing well!
Omg this is amazing i wish popularmmos was in here aswell
Dantdm is the whole reason I play video games. Crazy it’s been 10 years
Adam is such a vibe man.
Seeing sky is huge to me! Cause he was the first MC YouTuber I watched and like the first YouTuber I watch that wasn’t music videos! I do miss sky but glad he is doing well for himself! Built my childhood
Ok, but now you gotta interview THE OG Minecraft YouTuber, CaptainSparklez. I don’t think a single other YouTuber has impacted the culture of Minecraft and Minecraft YouTube more.
I wish stampy was here been watching him since the lovely World started
these three were such a big part of my life growing up
"and my lovely husband smallishbeans"
Ngl I prefer the 2010's minecraft community than whatever's up with right now's
YES FINALLY
This video made me cry tears of joy…. I grew up watching these Minecraft youtubers and this video unlocked memories I forgot I had. You should do another video like this with other og Minecraft youtubers too
Where’s stampy!
ldshadowlady was the mom that i never had
SkyDoesMinecraft shaped my childhood and i still rewatch some of his older videos for comfort
Idk if it’s just me but am I the only who noticed Dr.Tray was spelled wrong? Not to be picky Im just curious
Hey Anthony,great video and it was amazing to see The Minecraft OG's and the different experiences compared to more modern Minecrafters. If you ever want to talk to more minecraft YouTubers I think it would be interesting to talk to some of the Hermits who have been doing the same series tyoes since 2012
You should do a video with the hermits of hermitcraft!
what if stampy was in this
Skydoesminecraft is really something now... I hope he’s okay lmao
Sky looks slick, damnn!!
i used to watch all of sky's videos all the time, I lowkey miss it
You should do “spending a day with maladaptive daydreamers”
I remember Lizzie and stacyplays when I was 5 and to this day I still do
This is so cool. DanTDM was the first YouTuber i ever watched. Love all the people in this video though.
7 years ago i couldnt imagine anthony and dan making a video  toghether.    They were and are both so good, but just so different.  Times change  -Storable
my childhood omg
Built it battles carried my childhood.
Bruh if we go back to 2012 I’ll be happy (other then us thinking we were all gonna die😵‍💫)
I’ll wait for that dear music Adam
I still watch Lizzie ❤️ been around for 9 years
Make a video with technoblade
Anthony is not subbed to Sky ಠ_ಠ
We needed stampylonghead or bashurverse but these people are perfect.
Sky is just a bit Off the Hook I'd say..
the entirety of team crafted, especially sky and post, raised me, i miss them
i think about team crafted everyday of my life 🥲
I hope you do a subject on Kidney Transplant Patients.
o m g ! ! ! n i c e
SKY AND DAN WOEOWOOWOOW
I dont know where the heck I would be today if it weren’t for the og minecraft YouTubers
Childhood memories unlocked
Dan calling himself a youtube grandpa hit me somewhere special. I've literally been around since early on in all of these youtuber's careers and seeing them in such an important light again is so refreshing.
Dude Lizzie is amazing I love her and her vids <3 I've been watching her since 2016 and have seen every video she's uploaded since! :D
I saw Ldshadowlady and clicked instantly 💗🥺
thought dan's misconception ab him was "he dosent sweat"
PLEASE DO I SPEND A DAY WITH MY SMOSH EX CASTMATES
YO what if he did a video with game theory? 🤔
Can you make a video about YouTube stars who have found success in something other then YouTube?
Every Legend Has A Great Beginning And An Amazing Growth! As They will be our childhoods forever.
14:44 she definitely didn’t pass her peak. like all of her videos have at least more than one million views and a video she uploaded a few months ago even became her most watched video ever. her success is very consistent in my opinion.
Lizzie and Joel are probably the only Minecraft YouTubers i still watch and I actually started watching Lizzie bc i had never seen another girl that played Minecraft. And I liked that she was funny without even trying, the aesthetic she's always had and I love that her videos are easily rewatchable. I'm that one person that still watches shadowcraft and shadowcraft 2.0 lol
sky and LD basically raised me
Next time we jet stampys and aphama and pat
My entire childhood in one video. Wow. This is awesome <3
LIZZZZIEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Adam is just as chaotic as ever lmao These people were my childhood
please make a video about spending a day with fanfiction writers
dream shouting out patches 🤝 adam shouting out albert
This is Albert
LIZZIEEEEEEE
I would absolutely love an I spent a day with wattles . Js
Kinda wished you did aphmau lol
Is it weird to say that I actually cried wtf
dude, sky literally was the foundation of my sense of humour to this day. its so unreal seeing a video you make with him in it. much appreciated 💜
When i saw sky I verbally went YOOOO I miss you my boi
Albert
LIZZIE ♥️♥️♥️
LIZZIE??? AND DAN???? my childhood is in this one video
Duuudeeeee I'm having such a fucking freak out. Adam and Team Crafted inspired me so much when I was a wee preteen and Dan too. Freaking the Heck outtttt. I used to draw fan art and everything and now seeing all the clips I used to watch when I was younger is giving me the biggest nostalgia ever
After all these years, it's really nice seeing Adam being happy and energetic
Man, Adam is still his goofy self 😆
i had depression when i was 13 but i remember the only person that make me stay is dantdm. i used to make fanarts of him as well back then. he liked and retweet my drawings so many time and it really made my day.
I guess they weren't or aren't as popular as these channels, but I still wish POPULARMMOS and GamingWithJen were in this. I remember watching their wedding video, and the divorce. It really broke my heart.  I'm glad they are both happy now but man did it hurt when I found out.
Omg theses people were my childhood
the way ldshadowlady literally raised me and i still watch her content years later
Og Sky viewers remember Post before Post was big 😂
“What was your peak?” Dan: Meeting fans  Lizzie: getting in a game  Adam: I got a car that goes vroom vroom
I was watching LDShadowLady and DanTDM today 😁
This video is just a Nostalgia bomb  21:57 it’s weird but I miss hearing this laugh
Anthony u didn’t spent a day with og Minecrafters u spent a day with my childhood idols
Lizzie and Dan: *Shouts out channels and their fans*  Adam: "THIS IS ALBERT" *Holds dog in front of camera and starts dancing*
This is amazing 👏 I like them and the now creaters
Damn where is YOGSCAST :(
She sounds the same
i watched adam from 2013-2018 and he’s still hilarious bye
"Legendary OG Minecrafters" *sad that he didnt even mention Stampy...*  😢
LDSHADOWLADY IS SUCH A SLAY AND SHE HAS BEEN SERVING FOR A DECADE??!!! LIKEEE OMG
DanTDM is part of my childhood, like I watched him since I was six to today
Minecraft has been my life (mostly watching ldshadowlady) I feel like she partially raised me, moral of the story, I love Minecraft 😟
watching this brought back so much nostalga
Everyone: shouting out their fellow creators and funny references  Sky: this is albert
lol sky has the best life partying😆🥂🥂
its feel nostalgic that he still have his YOLO attitude 😅
I haven’t watched sky since probably 2016, but he was one of the first people I saw be open about mental health issues and that was really important for me.
WHERE IS STAMPY AND PAT???????
Can't wait for the jadien one
This is my childhood
Lizzie is still my all time favorite YouTuber
I wonder what happened to Stampy? I used to watch him all the time!  Edit: I searched them up and apparently they still upload.
spend a day with the creators of minecraft ( notch jeb etc..)
anthony should interview Smosh or somethin
Next video- spending the day with airplane crash survivors
WHERE IS CAPTAIN SPARKLES 🥲
YESSSSSS!!!!
I grew up with lizzie and dan i miss them sm
I kinda wish Stampy was invited too, he's one of the OG mincrafters if I have to say.
Stampy?
i.. i ahve the same sweater as my childhood hero... cat eating taco and pizza  in a galaxy sweater..
I spent a day with popular roblox youtubers, flamingo,  ???  ???
Legendary OG Minecrafters *AKA* Childhood Creators...
OMG LDSHADOWLADY OMG LDSHADOWLADY AHHHHHHH *happy noises*
When I say the internet raised me I mean these guys
Hey Anthony I was wondering if you could do the Minecraft YouTubers who fall into the gray area of o.d and new. There’s a lot of them who were smallish in the first Minecraft boom and kept slowly growing throughout the dying phase and are now booming with the new Minecrafters but not as much, there are a lot of people like this in Hermitcraft, legacy smp, and modded Minecraft servers like empires smp.
Where. Is. Stampy.
pissed u didn’t get stampy in here :,( /j /lh
yes
I watched Lizzie when I was 10 and now I’m 18. I’ve grown up with her and honestly her videos have brought me so much happiness and have gotten me through some of the toughest times in my life. 🤍🤍
Where is Technoblade 😭😭  We want technoblade
i’m so glad to see sky 🥺 he was my absolute favorite and i’m glad he’s doing okay
no stampy or squid:(
YOU FORGOT STAMPY
Yes Lizzie! That exact recipe + being true to yourself is the reason we will always love your videos.  You always stood out to me and was always someone i get exited to watch every content put up.
Antony:shows Dan,sky,Liz Me who is wating for stampy Stampylonghead not seeing himself 👁👄👁
Sky this is ALBERT
these people were in our childhoods and made it great but honestly they should've added PopularMMOs or Stampy because those people were really really popular
I remember coming home after school to watch the newest videos from Dan, Lizzie, and Sky. They all have a special place in my heart. Especially sky, my first ever fanart was of Sky battling a squid :')  Edit: just finished the video...sky is still the same sky. Hold on let me go cry for a while.
I never really liked minecraft but I love watching these creators
did- did this man just say niHAchu-?
OH MY GOD
I’ve been watching Ldshadowlady for at least 5 years, and she’s been a big inspiration to me. ILY LIZZIE <33
Lizzie 🥰🥰🥰
I dunno if you'll do the same video type again but if you do, please invite Lewis and Simon.
I WAS WAITING FOR STAMPYLONGHEAD!!!!
man...the good old days.
KOL
man I remember watching sky and then yogscast play minecraft back when I was younger
Great vid but should do a part 2 of this with stampy, Popularmmos, Captain Sparklez
Suddenly, I am a child again
Sky is insane in such a fun way, and Dan and Lizzie are so wholesome!
A L B E R T
No captain Sparklez omg ??
Omgg LD✨✌️😁✌️✨
Where is stampy
What about bajan Canadian and asf Jerome
grew up with the ogs and continuing with the new gen. love them all <3
SMH Anthony no Stampy. Not impressed.
Sky’s really chill and nice and now I know that
LDShadowLady was literally my reason for living
Lizzie and Dan were my CHILDHOOD.
This has brought me happiness seeing them being interviewed because we know that their legacy as ogs lives on
So I 100% love all of these creators, but am I the only one who watched a ton of Stampy?  I literally had watched/rewatched at least 2,000 vids of Stampy's before I ever heard of LDShadowLady and Sky.
Yooo I was in the screenshot  at 13:02 I changed my user tho I am no longer RoseTheStupidLesbian
My Wish is Granted now i can sleep
You spent a day with my childhood
lizzie was right about the “used to watch” thing. yeah, a lot of people say this when they rediscover a content creator, but just because we move on doesnt mean we still didnt love the content! people come and go from certain channels, and thats okay because there are still new people who are just discovering these creators and love it too :)
Albert the OG!
Where are the yogscast :(
I loved Dr. Tyrannosaurus
Tiffy (Cupquake) shoukd be in this video. She was a real OG.
It makes me happy knowing although Dr.Tray isnt in any of Dans videos anymore he still acknowledges how much the character meant to himself and his fans so much so he shouts him out
I watched ALL THREE of these youtubers, MY CHILDHOOD AHHHHHH /pos
OoOhhhh lizzie  👌😤💓 she freakin raised me bruuhhhh
These legends literally shaped my childhood and it's so bizarre to think that this much time has passed
OMG the nostalgia is REAL
MY CHILDHOOD MAN.
They aren’t youtubers, they are my parents
Use me as a “I spent a day with Captain Sparklez” video!!
where is stampy
YES MY BELOVED CHILDHOOD
LDSHADOWLADY OUR BELOVED
I was watching SkyDoesMinecraft at a time when I DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WATCHING HIM but I would not change that for the world. I have so many fond memories of watching him, NewScapePro, and all their friends when I was in middle school and I'm very thankful for them and all the joy they have spread in my life and in this community. I'll never forget them.
Dan’s hide n’ seek series ✋😩
Where is stampylonghead??? Literally made my childhood
I'm here for ld and Dan cuz they r legends and I love them. Lizzie is an icon in way no one will understand cuz she lives on a different planet. Dan is just so wholesome in a way I dont comprehend. Ngl I've never heard of sky but i would like to fo him a hug XD
where is pewds he is minecraft veteran 😤
you should do old school emo youtubers like people from my digital escape/ dan and phil etc❤️❤️❤️❤️
e
my youtube parents<3
Sky was everything for me at one point, now he's just a complete tool.
It’s so cool to be able to be part of the first AND second Minecraft waves because it really shows me how time can shape people and communities
these were the people of my childhood
stampylonghead should have been there :,)
I want whatever Adam is on LMAOOO he’s on another level
albert
These legends created our childhoods
I love Lizzie, she is so sweet!!! Love her❤️✨   Anyway these people built by childhood!!!!!
This video basically sums of my childhood
I absolutely love adam's energy xD
Oh shit! Thank you! Holy F*@! was not expecting that
me waiting for ssundee 😪😪
Brooo this is my big 3 of Minecraft ogs I’m so happy
Anthony is really running out of ideas for this segment
Dan and Lizzie: yeah we got to be parts of epic projects and do amazing things  Adam: *L A M B O R G H I N I*
"THIS ALBERT"
Bro I miss skydoesminecraft I remember watching all of his cops and robbers videos
ALBERT
i’ll cry
When I saw sky and Dan I got so many memories
omg i remember watching LDShadowLady and DanTDM as a kid. the nostalgia 😢😢
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT WAS POST MALONE UNTIL HE MENTIONED IT yet I watched those skits..
I loved all of these og mincrafters
Anthony you forgot stampy :(
I demand vikk and pewds
You should do a video with the Hermitcrafters!
damn no etho
I feel like the Anthony Padilla interviewing OG Minecraft youtubers didn't get so much attention, but honestly was my favorite interview that should of deserved more views 💜
I love how kid's today watch Minecraft content like the Dream SMP while this is the Minecraft content I grew up with.
Man, I remember Sky's try not to laugh videos like it was yesterday. Miss those days.
SSSSSTTTTAAAAAAAMMMMMPYYYYYYY!!!!! Where is he?
I’ve watched all three of them
Would've loved to see an appearance from Stampy ❤️
Imagine if stampy was part of this video
this was amazing
I still watch Lizzie to this day, along with Smallishbeans, I truly will never grow old of their content. <3
my childhood in a single video
Everyone I used to watch in 2013/2012/2011
Ummm where’s captainsparklez ._.
Try making next video called I spent a day with Smosh members
DanTDM was the best, literally. His adventure packs or whatever they were gave me a lot of enjoyment
This was such an honour. Thank you for inviting me to talk! 😊  It was so interesting to hear Dan and Sky’s perspectives too
It was such a different time back then, but I still watch all three of these guys occasionally now. I like seeing how they're doing. I also watch lizzie's  husband a lot still, but I have definitely moved on to the newer minecrafters like tommy, wilbur, philza (He's not new but he recently got a lot bigger than he was before 2020) and techno, etc.
I used to come home from school and watch Skydoesminecraft cops n robbers.
I think I talked to Dan's once...
Damn Adam brings back so many good memories and so does Dan.
lizzie literally raised me words cannot describe how much i love her
SkyDoesMinecraft/Everything/NetNobody/Adam, is insane.
aweeee, where's the captain though? Can't be an episode without the Captain Sparkly pants. A little bummed out to see he's not in the roster. Good people to have on, though. Wish Sparkles was here, too.
watched minecraft back then, i’m still somehow here
Sorry but I do not have respect for SkyDoesMinecraft. He changed from being a minecrafter to a distrack channel bc he got bored of minecraft. Deleted all his old minecraft videos. Then one day went back to Minecraft like nothing happened
LIZZIEEEE
adams still the same and i love that because it’s my comedy still and that’s how i also am
im actually an og minecraft player and im 12 yrs old
bro I just LOVE your editing style <3
The only thing that could make this video better is if stampylongnose was in this video
Oh god I didn't watch/play mc back in the day and this sky does mc bloke is way too hilarious!
I remember when Lizzie played CrazyCraft and Trollcraft :)
Could you do gachatubers :)
And no ones saying stampy
I remember 2013 was when I starter watching the OG Minecraft and Stampy, iballisticsquid, and DANTDM were the first ones I watched. I love it so much and it gave me a place where I felt safe. Now 8 years later I’m watching the Dream SMP and still loving it as much as before! Absolutely insane how the game has envolved from just funny skits to now like a movie with the lore and editing.
He should of got stampy
where is stampy?
For anyone who hasn't seen it: SPONTANEOUS TRICK OR TREATING That's the video that Post Malone and Adam did together with their friends.
damn no tobuscus???
Wow LDshadowlady is one my fav YouTuber, tell her that i said "Ur a great person"plz :)
It's like 6 am now and my Memory Unlocked Achievement just popped up
What happened to ihascupquake?
This video feels like I literally went back in time.
everyone always forgets stampy and iballisticsquid
Brooo as soon as Adam spoke I started smiling so hard, man made my entire childhood so much more fun :) Many nights spent staying up until sunrise binge watching his videos
It’s not og until popularmmos is there
WHERE IS POPULARMMOS? *im so disappointed*
Ihascupquake was at her prime during minecrafts hay day, not that she was a mine raft channel but it’d be really interesting for you to interview her on her YouTube progression
I feel like adams life is a fever dream-
Bro im loving adams energy, he's just having a good time with it 😂
I love how at the end of the video dan and Lizzie are shouting out various things and Adam is just like “yo this is Albert” I fucking love that guy
Omg I miss being a kid- ah my unsupervised childhood watch sky and team crafted- ahhhh I misss it soooooo much
I would've loved to see Stampy in this video too, but these OGs are just as awesome!
Bruh what about aphmau?? HAHA
Could you do more with LDSHADOWLADY please I love her videos
LIZZIE LIZZIE LIZZIE AHHHHHH
Thank you Anthony for this amazing interview!!! This made me feel so nostalgic and made my day.
HE IS SOO LICKY MET DANTDM THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE VIDEO OF HIS
These really are the og’s!!!!
Fun fact, out of these 3, only Sky is the only person not to be in Minecraft Story mode, imagine SkyDoesMinecraft if he were in MC Story Mode. That'd be awesome.
We never talk about Anthony's style, his fit is dripping
love them
They raised an entire generation
these people raised me. lmao
SkyDoesMinecraft and Deadlox had such a huge part in my childhood
IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS ANOTHER SHADOWCRAFT SEASON RIGHT????
ZACK SCOTTS SERVER… bro that server and all its players literally shaped who i am
Adam and Dan were my childhood there content was so good and funny
Can't wait to see "I spend a day with Jaiden Animations"
I'm shook CaptainSparklez isn't one of the peeps you interview in this video.
Wait Skye lived with Posty?
lizzie i love you 🥲 i miss shadow craft but i’m still watching empires
I literally learned english from Dan and Lizzie. I remember when I was smaller and my little sister was watching Dan and I asked if she even understood and she said that she couldn't but still watched since it was fun. Soon after I started watching and then somehow I suddenly started understanding english. It's kinda freaky lol. Thank you Dan and Lizzie for my good grades in english＼(^-^)／
LIZZIE YESSSS
Damn yeah, we definitely only brushed the surface of the really dark era Sky/Adam went through after the fallout of his business, as well as the turmoil around the end of Team Crafted. He took his interview with a lot of lighthearted chaos and comedy, but the man has absolutely dealt with his fair share of demons over the years. Hope he’s doing well
popularmmos should be there aswell as stampy
I Would Bring Lizzie A Whole Basket Of Fruits Bc She's My Childhood
hearing the name "team crafted" again after all these years gave me whiplash
Alternative title: when the fan bases weren't toxic and weird
Ive been a huge fan of Lizzie and never stopped watching her. Shes the most inspiring and entertaining youtuber out there. Her content will never die. Shes entertaining, funny and talented. The way she edits her own videos with background sounds and shes pretty creative. She really was like a mom or a really cool sister to everyone and we're all proud of her :')
I feel like despite it all, Adam is as funny and as entertaining as I remembered
Just watching this video brings out all the memories
All in all, it's great to see them all in good health and spirits. Although, I wish Stampy was on here too haha.
I watched Lizzie since 2013 and at the time I was about 6 which seems really fake but it’s not, my mom would put her on the tv while I was eating my gold fish on the sofa I was born in 2007, and now I still watch Lizzie for hours a day, I always get excited when she posts I find it funny and it passes time. If that’s not dedication then I have no idea what is
NOT THIS BEING POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY AND ME CRYING!!!!!!1
I miss when Lizzie used to swear, like in her GMOD days
Did sky do a line before this video or what the fuck
Calling them just legendary OG Minecraft Youtubers is an understatement, these guys (and gal) legit created our childhoods, petition to change their title to Legendary Childhood Creators.
Skydoesminecraft and team craft was my childhood
Oh daum
to think that these could be the mcyts we watch now in a few years breaks my heart. so many memories:(
LDSHADOWLADYY
Ahh I remember when i first came across ldshadowladys channel.. I was so bored that I just typed random letters on the YouTube search bar and I found her channel. Good times
brb boutta go binge watch ldshadowladys shadow craft
I never stopped watching Dan, been watching him for 6 years now still going xD
Omg I used to watch them all 24/7
when people moved on from their ldshadowlady phase but you never did 😀
These people were with me throughout my entire childhood, watching this filled me with intense nostalgia and i'm kinda emotional?
At first I was like “ok cool” then I saw skydoesminecraft and instantly clicked 😂  Edit to 7 months later: Childhood ruined
No one knew that Sky lived with post alone. Not even me. Jesus christ,that's...cool
Who come just for DanTDM
Im sad he didnt talk to the king himself Captainsparklez but am happy to see Lizzie!!
I’m so happy you’re going to do a non binary interview video! I was wondering when you were going to make one.
LIZZIE AHHHHH I STILL LOVE YOU AND I STILL LOVE YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE YO LOVE YOU. IVE BEEN WATCHING FOR 6 years 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Is Lizzie wearing a wig?
You should do spending a day with twins
Damnit they missed stampy I remember watching his lovely Minecraft world and wishing I would be in the love garden that man is still making videos I respect him for that
The sheer amount of nostalgia made me just straight up start crying god
I LOVE LDSHADOWLADY I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER SINCE I WAS 7AND IM  12 ALMOST 13
I think Sky’s gone crazy
"oh heck. the freakin. yeah" was my reaction when I first saw this video pop up
Skydoesminecraft was my first YouTuber and the guy I grew up with him so watching him now in 2021 made me feel extremely nostalgic. He led me to watch Lizzie and Dan and so many other og youtubers so I’m so grateful for them.
"THIS IS ALBERT!!"
I wish CaptainSparklez was in this video. He's crossed paths with Anthony before, having some of the same friends (Ian, Rosanna), so it wouldn't be hard to reach him, and he's _definitely_ an OG.
Hey I requested this kinda!
tecnoblade  invite him plez he cool trust
seeing the addition of Lizzie on this made my entire day!
What if Popularmmos was in this video.
If Stampy was in here I would’ve cried
were is stampylongnouse?
Lizzy was literally my childhood… guess minecraft YouTube never left me🥲<33
This was awesome! So much nostalgia, I'm glad they're doing great.
Damn! I haven’t seen Sky in a while!
SkyDoesMinecraft king
I still watch lizzies videos and I still think they are super good and as good as her old content and maybe better
OMG SKY 😭😭😭 he was my childhood 😭 so was Dan but man I was a fan of sky since 2011 og man
A day with roblox players/ youtubers!!
THEY ARE MY FREAKING CHILDHOOD
As much and as well as I remember these creators, I'm disappointed to not see Lewis and Simon from Yogscast.
I love seeing adam happy like this, he deserves it ❤️
My G where’s my boy stampy he is a true hero ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Uh... where is Captain? I am kinda surprised he isn't in this video. But, still glad to see SKY made in! :))
I miss getting excited to see Adams videos, I remember the OLD intro without the black background instead of blue. Pretty sure the first video I saw was him blowing up dawn, his gf at the time if I remembered her name right. Good ole days.
Dan stopped me from being like my siblings in a weird way, they are aggressive and have a superiority complex. He gave me someone else to absorb as a kid so I didnt turn out to be a menace to society. I still definitely play Minecraft because of him. He was literally my saving grace as a kid and I'll never forget him.
Imagine if Anthony was able to get StampyCat😩
These people as well as StampyLongNose were a huge part of my childhood 💖
Stampy is missing from this video
Popular mmos was the goat
LDSHADOWLADY MY BELOVED!!!
Sky does Minecraft hell yeah
I remember coming home from school and immediately running to my tablet to watch Sky, he practically raised me. I will never forget the laughter and joy he brought me in my childhood, I even cried when he said he was quitting Minecraft! He will forever be my favorite YouTuber, nobody can combat the enjoyment he gave me
Maybe it's a fun idea to spent a day with og twitch streamers
stampy tho, he was a legend
I love dan
We need TOMMYYYY
Let’s go the video is finally here! Sad that Anthony couldn’t do that many youtubers but still great video!
bruhhhh sky was my childhood, im 23 now, wtf
i still respect skydoesminecraft i just missed the old do not laughs and cops and robbers, i think anyone who has watched him for so long like myself would agree
banger vid
I would love to see I spent a day with SMOSH or RHETT and LINK
& stampy owo
I'm watching this while waiting for dreams new Minecraft manhunt
ive been watching lizzie for 8 years and i think the reason people stick around for content is because she has such a feel good vibe
I love Sky so much I got to try listening to his music!
I'm still watching DanTDM and LDShadowLady and I don't know when will I stop... I'm 18 bruh😅😅😅
Anyone remember when the of YouTubers like sky and deadlox got shipped like dream and George
Hey anthony could you do a part 2 with Popularmmos, Gamingwithjen,  and Stampy
The real Ogs: Dantdm,popularmmos,Stampy
Dude im having a mental breakdown right now God I miss 2013
When I saw the title the smile I had on my face
PLEASE ADAM IS LITERALLY AMAZING STILL
I'm ngl, I was hoping for Stampy😭😭 But still wonderful job Anthony as well as his Team
This video would have been way better if he got Stampy
Have been watching Lizzie for really long now, to this day her content still entertains me
I missed Adam so much glad he’s doing better
Holy cow. You said providing some of us with our entire livelihood and my entire life flashed before my eyes 😂 Dan was my childhood hero along with a few others. He was the person me and my sisters bonded over, watching his videos on the TV for hours on end. I remember he was who introduced us to Roblox, and my younger sisters still play it (I do too, just not as often). That alone is YEARS of entertainment and livelihood. Don't even get me started on Minecraft. My cousins helped us (toddlers and children aren't the easiest to teach a game) and so I have them to thank for that as well. This is just scratching the surface and look how much I've written! In other words, thanks for giving me those memories. Oh, and I still watch Dan! After it being my entire life not watching him seems weird
They created our childhood they deserve so much
lizzie and dan: great camera quality  meanwhile sky:  haha 360p go brrrrr
where is stampy uwu
Anyone else getting emotional getting reminded about smosh and sky does Minecraft as our childhood memories
Adams videos fucking raised me, his videos introduced me to more YouTubers that I have fond memories of and I honestly think if I never found his channel I would be such a different person. God I wish I could go back in time and re-experience all of that, I'm not ready to adult yet
Don’t mind me just crying in the corner-
Why is popular know not here
I think there may have been one too many syllables in Nihachu...
8:26
Slothful
They are very Legendary. They are most definitely OG. and I think we can all agree that we will never stop watching them and their content because of how much they were an impact in our lives. ❤️
How does jaiden feel about r/jaidenanimationr34?
ayup my childhood but missing stampy ayup
Im excited for the non binary one next week, my partner is non binary
tbh skydoesminecraft had such a huge impact on my humor in my childhood developmental years and it SHOWS. I just think that’s so wild because I know there’s tons of people who watched him when they were pretty young too and he’s just unknowingly influenced so many kids who are now teens and adults.
I do hope Lizzie keeps doing what shes doing cause it's perfect already :)
Albert is like "dafuq you doin to me, papa?"
I love the contrast of Dan and Lizzie compared to Adam lmao
Captanspaklez!!!
Captanspaklez!!!
I missed sky's humor- this guy is legendary
this is like a collab with all my childhood heroes
14:13 I still watch lizzies videos after  like 7 years
I hope the cube smp gets covered in a video as well
I'm just happy that Post Malone was automatically Team Crafted because of him living with Jason from TrueMU previously.
SKYYYYYYY
dan and lizzie literally raised me... :(
Anyone remember minecraft universe/trumu
It’s so strange to be able to say that I’ve still watch these people even after 10+ years.. I was born a couple months after YouTube was created so it’s kind of always been there and when I was old enough I started watching Minecraft videos. And I still watch them, old creators and new
*we all liked that*
LIZZIE YES
LDshadowlady literally shaped my personality to what it is today
Thank you for bringing Sky on 🥺❤️
god i remember religiously watching dan + adam and his friends when i was a kid <33 i’ll never forget that part of my life, it was so special
ok im gonna go edit my minecraft video that im gonna upload to my starter channel   HINT HINT
here at 85k views
Dan saying something about the villager... memories
LIZZIE
LIZZIE LITERALLY RAISED MEEEEEE
the fact that this guys created my childhood and they have been making me laugh most of the time when I was little. Jeez...it's been so long since I've watch them.
Where's captainsparkles tho?
LIZZIE!! ;u;
Stop I’m so happy
LIZZIE MY BELOVED
Next you should do Minecraft you tubers who quit/people lost interest in them
SHOUTOUT TO ZACK SCOTT FOR THOSE PAPER MARIO: STICKER STAR WALKTHROUGHS THAT GAME WAS VOID OF SENSE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
Awesome, please do Hermitcraft next :D
Where is popularmmo
THERES NO FUCKING WAY YOURE DOING A VID WITH OLLIE SYKES
YOOOO THIS VIDEO MADE ME CRY 🥺 these guys were my childhood, especially SkyDoesMinecraft and Team Crafted 😭 I got into Minecraft at such a young age, literally when it came out in 2009. I was 7. I found Stampylonghead and then SkyDoesMinecraft in 2010, and it just took off from there. I am now 19 and have been in the Sky Army for like 12 years or less. I still love them to this day 😭😭
Just a huge wave of nostalgia, I was a kid all over again watching this.  A few other legends from the past: Popularmmos, Supergirly Gamer, StampyLongNose, etc.
I still watch Lizzie to this day. She’s and awesome YouTuber who really seems authentic and herself on YouTube
fucking sobbing
PART 2?
commenting for the algorithm
he should toatlly do a video with technoblade since techno is both an og and new gen
the way i started watching them so long ago and still do :))
Spend a day with smosh
LIZZIE
Minecraft has and is a great part of my life. Nowadays my favs are DanTDM, Iballisticsquid, Stampylongnose, SquaisheyQuack, Mithzan, YourPalRoss, Quig, FizzySoda, SaysMason, and Red Vacktor (also the other Vacktors are amazing! Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, and Silver Vacktor)! All on Twitch is where I mainly watch em. Love em all!
Joel did not deserve this much disrespect Edit: wait that was sweet when Lizzie showed him out
The Real Minecraft Youtubers
I’ve watched LDShadowLady for years! So happy to see her here
Dude this is a great video
LDSHADOWLADY IS MY LIFE
A l b e r t
Crine
he should of brought stampy on
Hi to anyone that’s reading this: you are in big danger! If you die today or tonight and you don’t know Jesus, you’ll go to hell. No one is perfect, but that’s why God sent his only Son into the world, Jesus, to die for our sins on the cross. And to accept that your sins are forgiven you just need to ask God to forgive you and He will because of Jesus! Jesus loves you and cares about you. When you let Him into your heart He will never leave you! May God bless you and save you before it’s too late. <3
No stampy or popularmmos
Did Dan really not say anything about this :0
Captain sparkles?
I love seeing youtubers grow from that long ago, love all these youtubers, specially Dan :D
literal definition of my childhood they carried my middle school life
Sky just hasn't changed, in terms of how happy he makes me, ever since I was about idk, 7? 8? and now I'm almost 18? He's still out here making me giggle at him saying "quantum demons" like?? .. He still makes me so happy haha
ALBERT
Bruuuuu ima cry 😭
Petition for Anthony to do I spent a day with residential school survivors
i'm glad to see adam is doing wel mentally.
I have so many memories from watching these people as a kid. I will always cherish them. <3
I love Sky.
Adam seems just so chill now lol
let's not forget popularmmos they were always my favorite
i want to appreciate the fact lizzie shouted out her husband and fans, dan shouted out his fans and one of his characters (and anthony), and adam shouted out their dog. like, that’s so wholesome
I remember when LDShadowlady did 2 collabs with Yamimash.  They had such a chaotic duo type chemistry.
Adam is still such a nut, I miss him and hope his music goes hard
Lizzy!!!!!!!!!!!!! DAan!!!!!!!! Sky!!!!!!!
Sky literally was a huge part of my growing up lmao. So awesome seeing him, his personality and sense of humor is still really there and it really makes me happy to see. It’s good to see him making jokes and being happy right now
I literally grew up with Dan, Pat and Jen (Popularmmos) stamps, and squid
if stampy was here i would actually cry
Part 2 pls
There people raised a generation
Now it's the dream smp XD
Anyone else think CaptainSparklez could've been on? 😅
Hey you should do hermit craft next pls
Sky and Dan were my childhood
Where. Is. Stampy?
The time it takes her to realize a courgette is a zucchini makes me a little freaked out about the english from the US
LIZZIEEEEEE
It's great seeing these people happy
I still haven’t moved on from watching LDShadowLady, I’ve been watching her for so many years
I’m crying???
Having flashbacks to the Team Crafted Tumblr days
this is a massive combination of elementary school nostalgia omgggg
Can we get a "I spent a day with MORE LEGENDARY OG MINECRAFTERS"
I've been watching ldshadowlady since shadow craft and still watch every single one of her videos.
These people are my whole childhood :)
OH MY GOD LIZZIE AND ADAM IN ONE VIDEO
It’s funny because I’m only 13 and I’ve watched Lizzie since I was maybe 6 or 7......and I know Iv not watched her as long as others but let me tell you that when I think of my child hood I think of barbie,scooby doo and Lizzie I know that Im Still young and I still love all these things...but Lizzie has a special place in my heart she’s like the big sister I never have. I love Lizzie and will stay a shadow cadet forever I love you Lizzie ♥️✨🧸
I just watched some of Lizzies UHSHE and it was so funny at how cringey it was. its cool to see how much these people have changed
God, I haven't seen sky in forever, and dan... wow... the nostalgia
mmm nice.
Was anyone else super annoyed by the way sky was holding and spinning his expensive ass microphone?
Skydoesminecraft is so energetic 😍🤣
Alternate title: I spent a day with our childhood heroes
WOOOOO YEHHHHH
Missing PopularMMOs😭😭 and Stampylonghead
next he's gonna do "I spent a day with the Minecraft Prodigy, Technoblade. "
Can you do a “I spent a day with the CEO of honey.” I think it would be interesting to here their marketing strategy when it comes to sponsoring so many you tubers.
stampy, popularmmos?
when i say lizzie literally raised me-
Bruh were is stampy or iballisticsquid
dantdm pretty much raised an entire generation myself included
Pls do something with technoblade
i remember that bacon man video like it was yesterday 🥲
i still watch them lmfao
i remember watching dan so so much throughout my childhood
Anyone else remember when it was called let’s play T^T
Ni hah chu
I feel like I missed out on a lot of fun on Youtube when these guys peaked. :( At least Ik of them all now.
Dang I remember them like yesterday. Kinda wished that PopularMMOs were there too. Sad
LDSHAWDOWLADY HELL YA
He should do team crafted, I would love that❤️❤️
i watched skydoesminecraft every single day when i was 11-13, i’m 20 now and still find myself quoting his videos
DANTDM MY BELOVED
IM FREAKING OUT MY CHILDHOOD IS IN THIS VIDEO I USED TO WATCH ALL THESE MINECRAFT YOUTUBERS RELIGOUSLY
I wish PopularMMOS was here!
SKY
Anthony: what’s the biggest misconception about you Dan: that I don’t swear Anthony: prove it Dan: woah don’t put me on the spot like that  I laughed so hard 😅
Next episode we need Popularmmos and StampyLongNose
Albert :)
no etho?  damn. he created more chilhoods then these people.
I liked Albert
i could barely recognize them! its so refreshing i kinda wish i could go back to 2015, the memories of these OG minecrafters were so amazing.
Albert
yayayayayyaYAYAAYYAYAAAAAAAAAAAA
This made me a bit tearful tbh, it was a huge blast to the past, I remember watching all these lot a long time ago, I grew up watching them in fact and nowadays I barely do but I’ll always remember them.
This really makes me miss adam 😭 Him and all of team crafted were my whole childhood
I'd love it if Dan and his son make minecraft vids together in a couple of years.
what 2 great guests on the show today....sky was just being dumb
omg.. dan.. its been years
I'm so glad that Sky is in this video. If only PopularMMOs was here. Then, we would have my whole childhood.
Sky honestly seems like such a fun dude to talk to
if i didn’t watch them as a kid god knows how i would be like today
Skydoesminecraft was my childhood, through him I met so many other creatures and some I still watch. I’ve felt so bad for him because of the trauma he went through as child. He also went through so much with his ex girlfriend and getting custody of his son. If I could I would give him a massive hug and thank him for all he’s done for me and many others.
No Captain sparkles?
Do a part 2 and this time get stampy
Dantdm gave me my love for Minecraft and just video games in general I found games because of him it's great to see him still going today he is legendary skydoesminecraft just help even further with games and his don't laugh videos made me laugh harder than I thought was possible and ldshadowlady was one of my favorites to watch espically her I think the name is crazy craft videos if there's people who haven't watched their old videos I highly suggest doing it.
LIZZIE AAAA
Lizzy is still one if my favoret youtubers, DanTDM was on repeet when i was little and  skydoseminecraft i disvored a bit later but i then wached my mad!! Love these guys probaly shaped who i am today!!
Wait wait wait Dr TREYaurus?!?
Sky was such a huge part of my childhood. I loved his content so much. glad he is still doing good
The amount of nostalgia this video gave me 🥰
I wish you had Popularmmos
Crazy to think all these guys even Anthony was our childhood
im glad to see lizzie is still around i was and to my knowledge still am subbed to her channel just havent seen any videos from her in a long time.
idc how old i am i will always support the og homies hope i can show it to my kids :')
3:17 The biggest reason why some people succeed while other people fail. Full uncut Minecraft let's plays are only viable as livestreams because of the excitement of it being live. When it's a pre-recorded video, you should definitely cut out the boring parts and only leave in the fun parts. My brother livestreamed and uploaded them uncut to YouTube. He got nowhere after 2 years and quit. I'm also not very good with YouTube because of the crappy games that I play. Funny relatively short edited let's play videos with just the best moments are way more worth a watch than a mostly boring 2 hour let's play video. The problem is that most people are too lazy to edit their videos or don't have enough time because they spend 8 or even 12 hours at work and are also exhausted. I have no excuse. I have enough time and money. I have to start doing something with my life NOW.
Skies energy is something else idk wtf he is high on but I love it
you should talk to ihascupquake!! shes an og too but also just an og gamer girl and many grew up watching her!
OMG my most favorite YouTubers!!!! But I wish Dan would get back to playing with the lab and trayuris sorry for wrong spelling but I'm sad😔😔😔😔
Anthony i was expecting stampy
Both Dan and Adam were huge inspirations to me. As well as KDproductions (itdylan/Apollow). I've always loved Minecraft and I still love minecraft and these guys helped my love for minecraft.  I can't thank them enough for sculpting my childhood.
Can you do a video with critics YouTubers because they are a lot of them in all lenguajes
Sky and team crafted practically raised me as a kid, I still make jokes from them
Lizzie’s wig looks so nice (I’m assuming it’s a wig by the way it falls on her)
LIZZIE YES YES LIZZIE UES
God looking back I saw how Lizzie and Dan as mother and father or older sister and older brother  figures
Who else also binged all SkyDoesMinecraft new video and music for nostalgia
sky has not changed humor wise at all and i find that amazing
This is gonna be nostalgic.
These guys are true OGS. I love there vids a lot <3
no captainsparklez? :(
Rip to all the small minecraft youtubers who didn't make it.
This is probably something you wont do, but never hurts to comment. Can you do a video on professional Geometry Dash players? I really love the game and the only one ive been playing since i found it 5 years ago.
Bru
ALBERT
bacon man…how i miss thee
Seeing Adam again does put a smile on my face
I forgot how chaotic sky was lmao
Hearing Adam's voice for the first time since like 2012 goddamn
“I’m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ʷ/ⁿᵒᵗⁱˢ ᵒⁿ .🔔 🔔  ..

16:03 says "shoutout chelsea"
16:00 okay bmth reference I see you anthony padilla
I'm waiting for you to talk with Technoblade.
low-key wish pat and Jen were in the video 😔
not trying to be rude but i think evry one gets enuf adds about honny
I S   A L B E R T
Bacon man was iconic
But But WHERE is STAMPY :(
This takes me back to my early teens. Early stages of depression.  It has been 3 years and it feels like 30.
14:27 “i expect people to move on from my channel, but it is nice that they still have nice memories from my channel from the past” this is such a good mindset to have.
Lizzie is the only person from my childhood I still watch to this day and I still love her videos
When can the fans interview Anthony???
Another great video with great people😁❤️  kinda sad aphmau wasn’t in the video tho :(
hi
Can you sit doen with wilbur soot, Technoblade or people who worked on or played a charracter in a famous videogame.
Why is there no techno he only played mc
the fact that Jordan isn't in this :(((
2:05 HOLY SHIT i remember watching zackscott playing on scottland when i was younger! that was litterally my whole childhood
YOOOO
somehow i've never watched DanTDM
sky is still funny as hell lmaoooo
I grew up with all 3 of them and I still watch Dan, Lizzie on occasion, and about a few weeks ago I went on a marathon of watching all of the Cops and robbers, hide and seek, and try not to laugh from Adam.
Am I the only one who thinks popular MMOs should have been on here? Out of all the legendary Minecraft youtubers he's by far one of the biggest and has had the biggest impact on me as a kid
wowow
Yesssssss
i remember watching Adams roommate series and his hide in seek along with Dan's mod video review and stampy's letsplays man i really miss my childhood
Ldshadowlady was my childhood, I've been watching her since she started her shadow craft series
Alternative Title: Anthony Interviews Minecraft Legends before the community went to shit with Dream.
Dude I’ve been watching Lizzie and Dan for like 7 years
Smosh man and og minecrafters in the same video? Heck yeah!
*SkyDidMinecraft*    Well,  *"SkyDoesMinecraftAgain"*
I love how he says og
also i had literally never heard of any of these people except ldshadowlady very recently and hadn't heard of the other two until this video
I wish you had interviewed the channel TobyGames (also known asTobuscus)
This video makes me grateful for what we've got when we were kids because these people were basically our childhood (and some other YTers who weren't in this video). And i honestly see myself continuing on watching the OG YouTubers than the new ones like dreams SMP because it doesn't give the same feeling when i watch the og minecrafters.     And because they are so damn annoying and cringy maybe thats the reason why
MLGhwnt/Steven Suptic?
<3
OMG 💗🌟✨ these 3 are my childhood   LIZZIEEEEE ✨✨✨✨
I was literally just watching crazycraft
These are the og minecrafters that I watched the least. Used to watch Dan like back in 2014 but who I watched the most in 2011 was CaptainSparklez and Yogscast. Sadly Jardon wasn't in this video :(
My friggin childhood is this video I grew up on this stuff some of the best memories I have
Honestly dantdm and ldshadowlady are me childhood ive been watching them for around 9-10 years and they are two of my greatest idols
I LOVE THIS
lizzieee
I was hoping popularmmos would be apart of this
i used to wake up watch Dantdm and go sleep that was my life
DanTDM is 29 i thought he would be Philza Minecraft age like in his 30s
so glad lizzie was included
I just feel bad for Sky for all he’s been through
Cool
Yesss i know that this wode happen
OMG LDSHADOWLADY WAS LITTERY MY ✨CHILDHOOD✨
“yes i’ve got this” skydoesminecraft knows best
Aw I was waiting for Stampy, I swear he was like everyones childhood
I saw LDShadowLady and CLICKED AS FAST AS I COULD
Lizzies formula does work, she’s the only og youtuber I kept on watching.
this was so nostalgic but Stampy really should’ve been there!
Why am i crying
Why stampy ist  i love his lovely world
Something that wasn't mentioned but I find very interesting is how Lizzie met her husband (Smallishbeans) through gaming and Minecraft. I think it's so cool how they met through a video game and are now married!
I was basically raised by PopularMMOs and DanTDM. Their videos were my childhood
I saw DanTDM and Sky and I was shocked my two favorite Legends came back to talk about their tales
Never thought I needed this, looking back at their old videos just brings back a spike of nostalgia
I’m so happy that LIzzie was apart of this cause’ when I was really little her shadow craft series was all I watched and the thing that got me into modded Minecraft and Minecraft as a whole
Adam is so funny, god i missed him
IN PERSON VIDEOS?!
“Hello Once Again AUDIENCE!”
adam is exactly the same :’) i freaked out when i saw the title then went to google how old adam is now and WE HAVE THE SAME BDAY WAAA
you're missing Etho!!
Anthony, I love this video, and I am really, really enjoying this content, u know I met you on a German video, then I saw you on an Odd1sOut video, then smosh and then this channel, I like it very much, and yeah, if you wonder how is I didn’t know you, is that I speak Spanish, and I just started like a year or two to see you tubers on English, so you can imagine. So I’m just asking one thing, you know this German video I wick you were asking for pineapple pizza and nobody likes it and German told you and said “It’ll continue” you what, just asking. Keep going the way you are and hope you read it because how much I’ve written. Bye
u should do one with the middle minecraft likes aphmau and avatior games and such
It really sucks that he could've get PopularMMOs on her tbh. He was my childhood and I watched him all the time as a kid. He was probably the Minecraft YouTuber I watched the most
THIS VIDEO IS SO SWAG
Chelsea smile lmao
dantdm and these ogs were the reason ppl still play minecraft. not everyone appreciates that or most forget
MEMORY UNLOCKED:
I like how in the sponsor part he gets you super excited only to say "But now for our sponsor Honey!"  This was a great video though with a ton of memories coming back in, too.
LDshadowlady is truly legendary I love her so much <<<3333
You should interview Aphmau
any time Anthony has people that have been on this platform for a while do their little shoutout segment, they never shoutout their own channels.
skydoesminecraft my beloved
OMG it is finally out!!!
Petition to make I spent a day with Dr. Trayaurus
My childhood😍😍😍
omg this was something i did not expect wow
I cannot express the amount of joy this gives me
this man really just casually threw a bring me the horizon reference into an ad on a video about minefrafters. i'm impressed
Dang  he didn’t get bajan Canadian  on this
I seen this and not a second of thought went through, I just knew I had to watch
Okey fine. Lizzie is there and thats fine by me... but Im still missing CaptainSparklez XD
Here from dans stream lol
Adam looks, so happy and I am very happy after everything he's been through. Love ya big guy
I'll never forget Adam and just his sheer energy
i'm so glad lizzie was in this, she and stampy were the entirety of my childhood<3
Can you maybe do something about the hermitcrafters?
Hi dan
YESS IM SO GLAD LIZZIE IS IN THIS VIDEO
~childhood~
nah im mad where the fuck is stampy, actually baffed
I love this so knowing that I've been watching mcyt since 5 and haven't stopped
This is the video we wanted
Shout-out Chelsea
DanTDM 😲
Everyone's childhood in a video (Anthony included)
I thought Stampy would be here- 🥲
anthony should do a video on people with xenogenders!
You should do something with some of the hermits from Hermitcraft
dude Adam has me dying laughing just like he used to when i was younger, i love him lol
hold up let me cry rq
LIZZIE
OMFG YESSSSSSSS THIS ALDJJAKSJSJAKSKJD
i really wish stampy and popularmmos would be here too
lizzies wig LOL still beautiful tho
Dan was the first youtuber I ever subscribed to when I was 6. He changed my life in so many ways. I loved binge watching his mod reviews and laughing at all the things he would do. He inspired me to do youtube myself. I owe a lot to Dan.
I wish Stampy was in there lol
Where’s Mitch?!!
Oh my god, DanTDM was a huge huge part of my childhood! Stampy, iBallisticSquid, and DanTDM were the big 3 for me growing up.
ANTHONY IT'S TRAYAURUS, UNFORGIVABLE CRIME
These people raised me and inspired me to be a minecraft youtuber today. I hope I can be like them one day. Cheers to the legends! 🍻
so much nostalgia.
I still remember watching their videos everyday after school at my room like it's some kind of ritual lol
were all here for sky
My entire childhood in one place. I’m in heaven.
When I first discovered Minecraft content the one who I found was DanTDM, Dan is my nostalgia YouTuber, Dan was the one who got me into this and I’m happy about this
my king
new comfort video
corgette corgette- hop into that jet that jet :)
maybe spend a day with gender-fluid people? i will def be watching the non-binary one!!!
Hi
Just so you know, the first 6 seconds has a high pitch sound that is just absolutely horrible to me. I haven't watched the video yet, (I will, and will also enjoy) but that sound is just terrible. It goes through my ears and drills itself into my head. Ps. Im not trying to throw a pity party, but I do hope someone from the channel sees this so they can hopefully not do it in the future :)  Edit: it's also at the end screen thing
10:50 It's been so long since I've played MCSM, I didnt even remember she was in it!
I've never seen anything from sky does minecraft, he seems cool, definitely need to check out his stuff
A shame Stampy wasn't here...
PLEASE people who were fans of the Mindcrack server when they were 12-14 ish like this comment. guude, bdoubleo, mcgamer, and vintagebeef were my whole memorable childhood
what about pat and jen
all three of these youtubers raised me so seeing them in this video especially sky is so wacky
You should make a one on one video with captain sparklez. i feel like he's also super important when it comes to minecraft's history and was a huge part of a lot of people's childhoods
SKY MY CHILDHOOD
LEGENDARY people and a LEGENDARY video dude
Minecraft, the game that'll never die ❤️
I’ve always watched Lizzie and have never stopped watching! This entire vid is nostalgia!!!
<3
Ldshadowlady was my og Minecraft YouTube I loved  her videos but still do
Sad you didn't interview stampycat but thats alright
YESSSS I CANT WAIT FOR THE VIDEO WITH NON-BINARY PEOPLE
og of the og's
Me leaving this video with the intent of watching an LDShadowLady one.  *I was planning to do that anyway*
A shame stampylonghead wasn’t here. Good vid tho.
Imagine if me and sky made a song together 😳
Dan and LD: *talking about their expiriences with youtube and the ever changing landscape*  NetNobody: Yeah I see shadow demons
Where was PopularMMOs?!?
i literally just stop watching some old Minecraft videos of DanTDM O-O
Bro when I saw sky my heart was like SJSJSIISS WHAT
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
when i was 11 or 12 i am 20 now i had skydoseminecraft shirts that i still have and i paid for his server to be a vip member he has a genuine place in my childhood
No CaptainSparklez?
YEAA
It feels weird seeing Sky, after all the mental breakdowns he had on his channel
I’m surprised to see that aphmau isn’t here-
I forgot how fun and cool Sky is. I love that man.
Cool req🤷‍♀️ im colorblind and it would be reaally cool if you made a video with colorblind people🙌
I wish it was Stampy here.. love him man
I'm glad i grew up with these Minecraft YouTubers instead of Dream and that Tommy or whatever
*I feel like the universe is messing with me.*  3 hours ago i was watching sky's parody of paradise and thought that i missed him and then this video comes out now
Seems like Sky is doing better.
Amazing video!
10:23 me vibing
captain sparkles is still gong too hes a minecraft legend
Popularmmos is someone that made me laugh in 2014, and can make me laugh in 2021
HE ACTUALLY GOT ADAM! OMFG I CANT BREATH!
I aspire to AdamDoesMusic's level of confidence
Calling them Minecraft OG's is a very big understatement they are just god's who created our childhood
SKYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Even though we think they’re ancient, it’s because we watched them as kids
The funny thing is I still watch Dan like my friends said they did but I still watch him
YES I LOVE ALL OF THESE YOUTUBERS! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS!!
PogChamp
Dan was the creator of my childhood, I see that now he worked so hard for it and I didn’t deserve to be one of his fans at his age. Whenever I watch a wholesome YouTuber or funny youtuber I always thought myself as one of their best friends, Dan was the first person that made me feel like that.
it's a shame there's only 3 guests on this, I feel CaptainSparklez would be a great guest on this episode, as well as many others of course
I remember watching Dan and Sky in high school while avoiding studying for my math and physics courses, and now I'm halfway done with a PhD in physics... this is insane
I feel like the more and more anthony meets these amazing people the more I just keep reminding myself im such an introvert
Lessgoo og fans
I can’t believe u bleeped out her swearing
you have game on your  phone
I haven't watched anything from Sky for a long time and seeing his humor hasn't changed really is comforting
_Albert_
okay but where is stampylongnose
I was just watching a DanTDM vid
Should have gotten Ssundee
OG Minecrafters Pog! As much as I was hoping to see Etho in this one, I wasn't really expecting that to happen. He doesn't seem like the type to do interviews to begin with XD
I kinda wish Pat and Jen where in this vid aka PopularMMOs and GamingWithJen
can  PLEASE DO U VIDEO WITH TUBBO :)) I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!
Dantdm and Travis
WAIT so you're telling me Trayaurus never actually spoke, it was Dan the whole time?????
Adam is still one of the funniest dudes I know of
I didn't know minecraft was still around.
Me, a full grown adult: screamed in excitement for an interview with Ollie  😭 didn’t know I needed it till that lyric 😂
Captainsparklez should have been there
My childhood just flashed before my eyes when I saw Skydoesminecraft. Anyway, imma binge try not to laugh
No captainsparklez huh
they raised us and still do
That fucking bmth reference was awesome
Im a simple man, I see Lizzie, I click.
Ahh man I miss some older MCYT like them it's great to get this cose I forgot about most of MCYT like at all and I enjoyed that.
i fucking miss adam man
Could there be a " I spent a day with stampy" video?
I wanna sass a video with like OG daily vloggers  like ctfxc, shay  Carl… etc
Instead of OG MINECRAFTERS it should say MINECRAFTERS THAT RAISED US :)
i literally love them so much dude, like i looked up to them a lot and i still do. i would’ve liked to have seen aphmau as well but there are so many legendary og minecraft youtubers. idk if they would all fit in this video.
i loveeeee ldshadowlady
If Stampy was here and aphmau
were is spooklez? :/
Yoooooo Albert
Ni ha chu
albert!
the lack of the yogscast is disturbing
Lizzie literally created my childhood
Were is stampy 😩🤚
I just found out about Ld shadow lady a week ago
epic
At school my friends and I used to pretend to be the breakfast brigade (cough I was bacon man), man :> such good memories. Adam really shaped my life ngl
I love these minecrafters! This is a genuine example of some of the most OG YouTubers that raised a lot of us :)
15:57 WOOO JAIDEN
When's the vampire episode going to be out?
Ldshadowlady made my childhood so thank you so much 💕💕💕💕
ayo mork crispy i love your editing style c:
man i remember coming home every day from school and watching dan with dr trayorous and grim<3 and diamond dimensions 😎 edit: also hello dan if you see this, you touched my hand at one of your shows when you went on tour. you made my middle school self so happy :)
You can't have legendary minecraft youtuber without stampy and squid.
Oh shit thats right Sky knew Post Malone before he was Post Malone
Adam has not changed at all, still the crazy personality I love
LDSHADOWLADY I've never stopped watching her she honestly is so funny and dantdm raised us Genz sky was too old for me at the time but ldshadowlady and dantdm will always hold a special place in my heart
1 on 1 SSundee
before i even START this video i gotta say this THANKYOU FOR REMINDING ME OF THESE PEOPLE
All of you guys made my childhood on the internet great!
Man Adam really hit me in the feels, he was literally my childhood, I SPENT HOURS every day watching his videos, doing homework, eating dinner literally just all the time. My heart has a very special place for him and his videos <3
this content is delicious
That Chelsea Grin reference had me shook 😂
I have never heard of Sky Does Minecraft 😶
This video is amazing but I do wish Stampy was in this video because he was 80 perfect of my childhood
Where's CaptainSparklez tho
God I never knew how much I missed Adam’s voice, how chaotic he can get with that sort of “Wheee” voice he used to do really makes me wonder why time had to fly by. I hope all OG youtubers are doing well
I asked for popularmmos when he mentioned it but I love these 3 still :)  I still think it’d be interesting to have Pat on especially after the change from his divorce with Jen but that could be uncomfortable
istg dan and lizzie were my childhood
No stamps 😭😭
Anyone else used to watch Dan and the lab like a religion
I loved skydoesminecraft in this. He is a mood fr
YAAAYYYYY
omg my childhood, brb gonna cry
OHHH YESS
dan was fr my childhood
My favourite YouTubers from when I was 5-10 are lit all in the video, besides all the cube members (S1), and Harmony hollow members
ShadowLady ❤️
There's none of the Hermitcraft guys: ahhh... There's Dan: Yey! there's an upcomind video w/Jaiden: YEY!
I spent day with hermitcrafters next plzz
Lizzie was my childhood and is a part of my adult life still… I remember all her series like ShadowCraft etc. Absolutely love her, and Joel 💜. But my OGS and the ones I started watching MC YouTube is Joey Graceffa and Stacy.
Brb gonna go binge old prison escape videos
One with captainsparklez would be nice!
Captainsparklez, Ssundee, DanTDM were the main people I watched back then ♥️
I’d love to see a video with people with sensory processing disorder
I LOVED these youtubers as a child and I still do ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So glad I grew up with this   But hey, let’s not gatekeep the community and let some new creators take the spotlight
WHERES POPULARMMOS!?
YESSS DANNNNNNNNNNN
THAT INTRO WAS VERYDEEP
dan lol
One day when your 69 and you see on you tube that these people of our childhood have pased away and you greif over their death always remember to keep the ones you love close becase you never know when they will be taken away from you...
Sky is a legend
i screamed when i saw this notification
I love how sky could have shouted our his music but he just grabbed his dog instead
I still watch all of  lizzies videos ❤️
LIZZIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
16:01 BRING ME THE HORIZON HELL YA!! 🤘
Anthony I love u bro
YESSSSS WE LOVE THE LIZZIE APPRECIATION! i feel like people forget abt her:/ so i LOVE this😭😭😭😭😭😭
sky done minecraft
1000 comment,  And ayeee DanTDM
i would love a part 2 with captain sparklez, bajan canadian, double, ssundee any of the three HAHAHHA
LIZZIE MY BELOVED !!
AHHHHH
LETS GO DAN GOT IN!!!
pls don't forget minecraft
Really thought ssundee was going to be here
I almost cried during this video because sky was my childhood and honestly I still go back to watch his old videos, but I'm glad that he is doing better and doing something that he likes, I honestly watched his videos because of his personality and he still is amazing
I wus watching dans stream when I got this
:,)
ALBERT
Ogs know popularmmos was were it was at
GET STAMPY
Shoutout to Albert
I saw ldshadowlady in the thumbnail and title and I instantly clicked   My sister recently started watching lizzie so I've got hooked onto her videos again
This made my day team crafted is my childhood. :((((
AND I STILL WATCH LIZZIE LMAO‼️ Her content is good :)
You can't work 20h/day and sleep 4h without Mania tell that to Sky 🙄 You brain needs to be broken for that to happen, it should shut down and get tired, the way you would sleep atleast 6h/day and sometimes 15h. I have bibolar so I know what Mania is. That's very clear Mania and it can also cause the otherside, you brain runs out of hormones because it releases too much of them when you have mania, that can lead to depression and that strong of a Mania can even kill you.  I wrote it before he tells about the depression, that's the cause of the depression, not the drinking..
I wish ihascupquake was on this episode. She was literally my childhood
Lizzie, personally, is the most *legendary* Minecrafter. She has been uploading content, which she spends HOURS of work on each episode (not editing, she does like 4350 things in one video) , and came out with dozens of unique and carefully created series, and has never had the quality of her videos decrease. She is such a legend that her videos get millions of views in 2-7 days of uploading STILL, even after the Minecraft videos hype died.
I love how most you tubers are like OH I GOT MONEY U DONT HAHA POOR but these guys are like yea i'm rich but idc.
Albert was my favorite person in this video
No Stampy :(
Oh, Sky. That's a nostalgia trip. Glad to see he's doing well.
Minecraft Story Mode is actually what introduced me to LDShadowLady and to the whole Minecraft Community.  PewDiePie is everywhere lol.
I saw Sky and nearly cried-
Please do StampyLongHead!
i am literally so so happy lizzie is here :)
seeing anthony and sky today is like checking in on an old friend/friends. it’s so surreal
okay so ima just throw a random topic here spending a day with Pokemon youtubers
QUANTUM SUPER DEMONS is 100% sky's band name lmao
All of theys guys were my childhood
i missed adams chaos lol
LDshadowLady and SkydoesMinecraft are the OG
MY CHILDHOOD
Next you should do ssundee
the fact stampy isnt there is just sad
No stampy😔
We need an OG youtubers one now!! Zoella, Joey graceffa , Tyler Oakley, dan and Phil!!!
Why so much video game content?? Blehhhh
dab
imagine if stampy was in this 😫
banger vid
WHERES STAMPYCAT????
Do og GTA gamers next 🙏
honestly i think anthony should spend a day with wilbur soot, hes such an interesting person and hes done so much from writing stories to being a mucisian to creating an arg.
LIZZIE! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I LOVE HER.
I half expected Adam to just chant "Minecraft Minecraft" like he did on SMP Live
Someone needs to make a "I spent a day with Anthony Padilla" video
Iv been watching ldshadowlady for 4-3 years she is my child hood she inspired me to play Minecraft
AHHH LIZZIE IS MY CHILDHOOD I LOVE HER
I'm kind of disappointed you didn't get Stampy but, this was amazing!
I never thought this day would come, DanTDM talking to Anthony Padilla.
Looking back at the king's and queens who shaped our lives to much. I have so many good memories of all three of them
Ldshadowlady shouts out smallishbeans:  Everyone liked that
I was hoping popularmmos would be here but to be completely honest he would be so awkward and scared.
nice.
never watched skydoes but i've heard of him before and now i regret i never watched him because he's kinda chill
6:30 That one hits close to home. A teacher gave us the assingment to write a short story once and I completely let all my creativity out on it eventually coming up with a war story involving myself. So suddenly the teacher changes the assingment to telling your story to the rest of the class which I was not prepared for because if I had known that ahead of time I would've made sure to come up with a basic neutral story and certainly not built it around myself. So long story short on the day I told my story to the other students I got lucky because half the class skipped school that day and the guys I really didn't want there were actually absent, 1 guy tried to roast me but he quickly gave up. My story stood out however and I was asked questions about it for about a week even by people from other groups who would've otherwise never even heard my story to begin with which still made things awkward since I certainly wasn't planning on going through it again (Also got a good grade, guess the teacher enjoyed herself)
Does anyone else remember ssundee seeing this video made me remember him lol
Video idea: I spent a day with SPANISH YOUTUBERS
if dan wasn’t in this i would sue
I think your title is incorrect from my understanding there's only 8 billion people on earth
Anthony you should do “I spend a day with tokusatusu YouTubers” a channel you could interview is marcasatsou
YESSS I KNEW LIZZIE WOULD BE IN THIS VIDEO <3
We need a PART 2!!
Bruh I really thought CaptainSparklez would be in this....Really loved everyone in it tho! Dont get me wrong!
It’s gotten like 20000 views when I was watching
Yeah, this is too much nostalgia in one video I’m out
ayyyyyyyy WE LOVE HE OGS
I think all of us would watch a part 2 of this lmao
It's amazing that Stampylonghead and dantdm still do youtube!
I love watching sky and dan, mostly sky he always make me laugh when I was a little kid, man was my childhood. I miss team craft
This is making me want to watch their old videos...      And now I'm going to
AYEE SkyDoesMinecraft let’s goooo !!!!!
MY CHILDHOOD IN A VIDEO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 /pos
It would have been fun to see people like CaptainSparklez and AntVenom cuz they were big with minecraft too
Lizzie was the reason why i play minecraft :)
I seriously *screamed* when I saw LDshadowlady in the thumbnail
Lizzie is my most favorite minecraft youtuber ever, so this made me happy😃
Where is the yogscast?
lizzie was the mom / older sister figure i never had, i love her & the content that helped me grow up forever,, she truly helped me become the person i am today.
This was so nice to watch :D I loved watching LDShadowLady when I was younger ^-^
Where is Stampy :(
LIZZIEEEEE
NeeHachu? What happened to Nihachu lmao
I’m sorry but I need a part 2 of spending a day with OG Youtubers
Damn, you forgot to get in PoppularMMos
i want to be anthony so bad rn, i'm jealous
Nice
Dan and Lizzie: yeah Minecraft was a pretty big part of our lives  Adam: POST MALONE
Bruh sky had such huge impact on me as a child and I still find myself referencing his old videos from time to time. Seeing him really made my night!!
I still match skys energy after all this time and I love it so damn much.
Minecraft lets plays helped keep me sane this past year and Lizzy is one of the ones i watch
"Hey Trayaurus"  *Today On Phrases That Spark Nostalgia*
yesss more minecraft
As stupid as it sounds, I used to think that people like Dan and Lizzie, creators who I literally grew up watching, never got burnt out or tired of their careers since they were expected to keep making videos and appeared happy in every video they posted. It's important to see a person's vulnerability sometimes, especially of people you admire, because it helps you step back and recognize that, as much as they're idolized, they're normal people.  Amazing video!
sheeeeeesh my duuuude
I need a video with stampy
Skydoesminecraft brings back too much memories and I feel bad for everything adams been through…
I appreciate this, greatly, I only wish Stamp and Pat & Jen were here!
I love Adam.
og youtuber talks to og youtuber
Please, I miss being young and staying up until 3 AM watching them play Minecraft. 😭
these people shaped most of my childhood, along with Aphmau, but they are literally amazing!
YO SKYDOESMINECRAFT?!!!! The guy was truly a legendary minecrafter. You didn't even need to be a fan of Minecraft but you know his name.
Dude u didn't bring any hermitcraft player not in the other video, not on this vid  Wtf !
I haven’t heard Adam’s voice in years, hello Adam
Just sad stampy isn’t ehte
LIZZIEEE!!!! <3
Man I miss those old days, I loved Adam, but he just seems to be in a very different place right now
Do a video with the hermitcrafters
This was a good video but u would’ve made me cry if u got stampy in this vid.
These three were my comfort youtubers (that and Stampy and Aphmau) and it is so awsome to see them again 😁
YEAHHHH
ᴵ’ᵐ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ
OMFG SKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy
wait wait wait... HE WAS LIVING WITH POST MALONE NONCHALANTLY
Loved the video, but I wish that PopularMMOs was in this video because he is legendary.
its funny how half of the swears are bleeped out but the other half is not!
To see Adam talk about Minecraft Is such a breath of fresh air
you should meet the new smosh crew
I've never been so dissapointed in a Anthony video, Captainsparklez isn't in it 🙄✋
I’m not sure what sky was talking about for roughly half of this interview but I agree with all of it.
Pls do a video with lego youtubers i would love to see that
sky gives me adrian pimento vibes            but less creepy
I also want to go back to 2014
These people created my childhood
Man, PopularMMO’s didn’t make the cut?
Estrañas Grabar con Ian ?
Adam was fr the best in his prime.
omg when he missed pronounced Nihachu and also i still watch lizzie daily
I wish Etho or Docm77 were in this video but it could be another video.
I just need to say this: this video really showed me and reminded me of my childhood when I was like 6 or 7. SkyDoesMinecraft. What. A. Legend. I need to go back and watch his old videos again, I remember them being the most entertaining videos I ever watched when I was younger so when he went through all this drama, it really hurt me to see him in that way because I felt like my favourite YouTube as a kid was shredding away infront of me and it hurt. I’m glad to see he seems in better health now and I hope he gets back to his former glory.
Its like a blast from the past. Skydoesminecraft introduced me to minecraft and was part of my childhood. Now I'm an old woman.
you shouldve had stampy
Where's Ehtoslab tho?
What abt stampy
ITS LIZZIE WAYYY
YES WE LOVE LDSHADOWLADY SHE IS A QUEEN <3333
Luckyyyy
I still watch LDShadowLady, in fact, I'm watching the Empires SMP of which she's a part of. XD they're still going strong.
So what Adams saying is that he does drugs
adam is high
This video can out 5 minutes ago but I've been watching for over 15 minutes
Anthony Padilla should interview some game developer channels on YouTube like Dani, Lilian, and more  Or engineers like hacksmith and jlaservideo
i love how lizzie is in this
god, these people were my childhood.
Oh my god...
I know Stampy and IBallisticsquid aren't in this video but does anyone remember the series race to the moon and all their adventure maps those were the good times
I wish he had Stampy on here 😢
not post Malone 😭
lizzie needs to be given more credit for raising me. like srsly she influences my current self so much it impeccable
Fun fact in Joel’s ski video you can hear Lizzie cuss
I remember actually learning English from DanTDM and SkyDoes minecraft. I only began watching LDShadowLady when I was slightly older.
Ya boiiiiiiii!
ayee that bmth reference lmaoo
You’ve gotta do a part 2 to this with stampy 😭
Dan & Lizzie: Wholesome moments Adam: D E M O N S  &  S H A D O W  P E O P L E
7:28  so that kid that had asked him that at miencon was actually right?
I still watch and love Lizzy
I’m gonna cry...
lizzie shouting out joel and her fans instead of herself is the cutest thing ever
I really wish stamps cat was on this tbh
Please tell me I wasn't the only one who was expecting popularmmos... :[
0:43 ldshadowlady aka Lizzie 0:47 dantdm aka dan 0:57 skydoesminecraft aka netnobody aka adam
Hi
Oh, not the guy who made the really bad ksi diss track.
I never knew that i could get so happy from a yt title
Can you plesae go back to smosh I miss you with Ian  u together
RIP Stampy, Aphmau, and Etho not being in this video
I love this Dantdm was my childhood
heyo mr pasilla i just wanna say i loved when you and dream did a video i love both of you and i just wanna say dream or any youtuber should not have to go through all of that 🥑🥑
"We didn't even realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun."  -Winnie the Pooh
Was sky high?
U should try interviewing@aphmau
16:03 i appreciate the Chelsea Smile reference, my guy 👀
Everyone @postmalone
I really wanted stampy in here :(
When I say Minecraft YouTubers these are the types of people who I’m talking about
DAN HAS A CHILD
Just rewatching my favorite episodes from this channel, then this appears.  *”A BLESSING FROM THE LORD!”*
Longtime love Lizzie 😝🥲❤️
Adams music was really good, I listened to his music when he dropped his album.
Putting so many OG's in this video itself makes it the ultimate legendary video
Good old days!
“IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!”
sky chaotic energy still lives on and i love it
I feel like Adam’s sense of humor hasn’t really changed since his old videos. Which isn’t a diss. I like it.   Well…should not have said anything good about them
Bruh
DanTDM is like the coolest person ever.  He is like our second dad that made us happy whenever he uploaded.
I got so excited to see Lizzie lmao I saw her name pop up and was like B) I still watch her from time to time and I recently went on a tangent watching all her old content and now I'm enjoying waiting for her new content to come out B)
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR LIZZIE
Tbh Lizzie is really the only Minecraft channel I haven't moved on from, I tried to get back into Minecraft channels so many times like I was when I was littler but it never stuck. I've been watching her pretty consistently from crazy craft 1 up till now though. I think it's because she doesn't upload much I'm able to keep up with her stuff without missing a bunch of stuff which is something I appreciate
hello
did anybody else grow up on aphmau?
Lizzie is always herself and I think that’s what makes her a wonderful minecraft YouTuber
I remember when Jenna Marbles mentioned that Post Malone was hanging out with Minecraft Youtubers in her SiriusXM show and I had to go back and see and I remembered him being there with his guitar! Crazy small world we live in
9mineutes
pog
goood old dayss
Can't wait to watch this !! :)
Absolutely epic
if you didn't watch crazy craft from lizzies pov, did you even have a childhood?
Ayo, let's gooo!! :DD
How the times have changed back then it was just Minecraft let’s plays and roll plays   Now it doesn’t feel the same
Anthony is such a great interviewer period
legendary OG minecrafters    oh yes I am going to cry in a corner now...
Can't wait for someone to type WhErEs dReAm
Was bumped not to see Jardon (aka captainsparklydick) here :/
Anthony releases a new video: 🙂 It says minecraft OGs:😀 Dan is in the thumbnail: 😱
13:54  Philza Minecraft:👁👄👁
Anthony, did you like playing Minecraft?
Can we do a spend a day with hermitcraft? 😊
Captainsparklez isnt here. Big sad.
I love lizzie’s videos I’m always down to see her play Minecraft
ur gay
Bro, this whole video is my childhood...
Team Crafted were my childhood, man. What a throwback! Great video Anthony!
Three big influences who shaped a huge part of my childhood, especially Sky!!! I'm glad they're around and doing well still!
DanTDM is like our second dad that was there for us. Glad to be born in this generation
lizzzy!!!!OMG im so happy
DanTDM was the first Youtuber I ever watched, the Youtuber who made me want to play Minecraft, and the Youtuber whose making videos technically changed my friends, my personality, and my forever life.
ADAM!!!!!!
Dan at 9:21 : *Man this shit is bout me  not you *
Where's PewDiePie? >:c
LET'S GO I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
I’ve watched Dan since 2013
The kings and queens of youtube
Where’s pewdiepie
Never thought I'd see the day where Anthony from smosh would meet dantdm the man who sold bath water on high pixel for 10million
I wish Stampy were here too, but this is a great lineup!
Man, watching this video makes me nostalgic.
OMG a one on one with Jaiden Animations?! I am HYPEEEEEE (pls tell her that she is adored and she has helped me so much. we're about the same age and she feels like a friend to me)
adam & all of his friends he’s had on his channel were literally the biggest & most memorable part of my entire childhood. OG minecraft youtubers really have done more for young adults/the online sphere of gaming than they’ll ever know, seeing them all again still brings a giant smile to my face
You should have done stampylongnose. He was like our second dad with DanTDM. Love you stumpy
Omg ldshadowlady practically raised me as a kid, she was my childhood !
Damn, child hood went brr.  I'm still subbed to these people.
A zucchini is a berry
Man I want captainsparklez episode!!
I wish stampycat was on here😞
My childhood literally in one video
*THESE are THE minecraft youtubers . dream holds nothing to them.*
I’m glad Anthony paid attention to me saying that he forgot Dantdm in the Minecraft vid.
Anthony Padilla’s videos are awesome
Isaac and his Isaac lived in a small isaac
I used to watch these people like 10 years ago I still enjoy watching these people
When is someone gonna spend a day with Anthony?
No stampy…… I’m disappointed
MY PARENTS ARE IN THIS VIDEO (/j)
LIZIIEEEEEBDJWI
I have literally been watching ldshadowlady since I was a fetus
LIZZIE
LIZZY!!!!!!!!
I'm slightly (very) disappointed that stampylongnose did not make this video
Yo this is so informative bro
OKAY😎
DanTDM is my idol and hero and has been for YEARS he shouted out Dr Tray 😂😂
Spend a day whit hermitcrafters
WHERES STAMPY OR SQUID?????
Day 4 of asking AnthonyPadilla to do an interview with Callahan and MegaPvP
Where is TECHNOBLADE
I hoped Popularmmos would be in this
WHERES STAMPY?!
Ok but aphmau
i'm jealous
Adams had a tough time in youtube. And life
Now do I spent a day with Smosh
Anyone else remember dr trayaurus, “I broke my hand”,  pixelmon and fnaf? 🥺
Now if PopularMMOS and jen were on here this would have been everyone I watched as a kid
I love them so much  Dan holds so much goods memory in my life
OH MY GOD YOU DID LDSHADOWLADY IM GOING TO CRY— SHE WAS MY COMFORT YOUTUBER FROM 2012 TO NOW AND YOU DID HERRRRRRRJEBDJSHDBSHS
I grew up with all of them 😭😭😭
im the 13,986th viewer HAHA
damn i wish we got captainsparklez in this
Could you do one with vanossgaming and how he exploded and now does music
You should spend a day with Anthony from Smosh
I can't believe he lived with Post Malone, awesome
FUCK YES I GREW UP WITH DANDTM HES SO MUCH BETTER
I clicked for LD💗💕
Where is JARDON??????????
i think my best memory as kid was watching stampy vids
Where’s etho?
LDShadowLady was the first YouTuber I ever watched and she is still my comfort YouTuber ♥️♥️♥️
Lizzie
Finally the mc YouTubers I actually care about
Oh my god! Sky ;(
These 4 people shaped my childhood
While watching this it felt like I was catching up with old friends
wasn't expecting sky's name to pop up again.
Thank god it’s with the OGs instead of the new ones….
I recently watched Lizzie since last year but I love her already
Kinda wish he included more but hey maybe in a part 2?
Holy shit I forgot Post Malone played Minecraft with Adam
Nostalgiaaaaaaa
Where's pewdiepie? 😂
I love the vod but the only thing I'm sad about is there's no CaptainSparklez. But that's ok
Was kinda hoping for tobuscus, but this is fine
LIZZIE YES
I remember watching these guys. Tbh these guys are still kicking butt long after I stopped watching. Props to these guys.
DANNNNNNNNN WOOOO
now this. this is what i needed.
WOW
they created the childhood of millions of people *truly legends*
gamer
LIZZIEEEE
rip paulsoaresjr
Tobuscus, CaptainSparklez???
Anthony you’re really the best you always provide a nice happy place for me to come and unwind thank you.
it’s crazy watching these people grow since the very beginning as to where they are now
So this is what it feels like to get hit by a truck of nostalgia
Ayyy Dan got Featured
ALRIGHT WHO ARE THE 7 PSYCHOPATHS THAT DISLIKED THE VIDEO. THIS IS OUR CHILDHOOD. THANK YOU ANTHONY.  (this is in no way intended to harm anyone)
I’m crying adams here he’s really here
Lizzie and Dan practically raised me when my parents didn’t want to
NUUUUUUUU, ME NEED JARDOOOOONN
This is bringing me back.
Anthony is now 1° of separation away from post Malone
Where is Stampy
Ok but let's not forget that Shubble was the 1st Minecraft YouTuber on here.
Why am I so emotional watching this aaa🥺
man i miss da old days thx anthonny VERY COOL
Oh so we’re all early?
I wish stampy was in this video
Everyone here is so excited for sky but I’m excited for lizzie collabing with Anthony
Epic
This is absolutely amazing! Adams humor feels like it hasn't changed at all :)
I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED THIS BUT IM SO EXCITED TK SEE LIZZY HERE
SKY AND LIZZIE ARE MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD OMG
Does this take me back or what?
I remember being so upset when SkyDoesMinecraft stopped making videos. I never knew he came back to YouTube.
The people I grew up with <3
Where in the fuck is Stampylonghead
I love LDshadowlady 🖐😩 I still watch her
i used to watch sky and team crafted all the time when i was around 13/14, im soooo happy that he is in this video! he really made my childhood so much better <3
I love being early
I miss the Glory Days of Minecraft on Youtube, It's still big today but nothing in compare to the OG days of Minecraft.
Ngl was hoping to see CaptainSparklez here since he stood with Minecraft even when it was  dying and before it came back
you should spend a day with howtobasic
i almost met danTDM once
philza is also og right?
anthony your so lucky
damn feels so nostalgic watching this
I was raised with Skydoesminecraft. First Minecraft video was Sky’s Lava Island playthrough. Never finished it, sorta lost interest after ep 3. Seeing him brings me hella nostalgia.  Ooh! Ooh! I was also 7 when I watched him!! Didn’t have headphones so I camped in my moms bedroom so she wouldn’t hear him swear!
Man skydoesminecraft really came back to life
The way I would steal your life if I EVER got the chance is immaculate🙆😏
this videos gonna be good
Remember DanTDM’s Minecraft Lab? That is so nostalgic!
Me:Breathing Heavily  Also Me:HOW ARE YOU GETTING EVERYONE TO- AHHHHHHHH
this low key made me tear up minecraft is my childhood
One of my favorite Youtubers (Anthony) interviewing my favorite Minecraft Youtuber (Lizzie), YES JUST YES
Hey Anthony I was wondering if you can interview people with anti-social personally disorders (psychopaths/sociopaths). Sexual Assault/ Rape survivors.  And people raised by same-sex couples. These are just suggestions though. Have a good day!
Who else would’ve liked Stampy  Squid Ssundee Popularmmo’s But I guess these guys do the job
He finally did it
LD shadow lady
You should spend a day with simmers: Deli Plumbella Lil Simsie and james turner
I know there’s a ton Minecraft videos to learn how to do things and stuff, but Lizzie has literally taught me how to play Minecraft XD
Adams so sweet.
I wish Bajan was here, so curious how he disappeared
Huh, but Sky does upload minecraft again right?????? 1:40
Lmao I wish you were able to get hold of popularmmos but amazing video
Among us
<333333
im here early yay
E P I C
It's too bad Anthony didn't get BajanCanadian.
man really forgot popularmmos
Anyone remember Stampy cat?
ah man i used to love dantdm
SKY
im literally so happy rn i dont know why
Oh man... Skydoesminecraft! That brings back memories!
BRO 8-10 YEAR OLD ME IS SCREAMING RN
I saw sky's skin and I just had too click, I grew up with this man so ofc I'm gonna click when it comes to him
I didn’t realize sky was still alive I haven’t seen him in years
Wheres yogscast?
Weird seeing my childhood idols again after so many years.    I miss them.
I grew up on these people. so nice to see them again
Damn I really wanted ssundee
2030 be like: "I spent a day with OG Minecrafters (Dream, Technoblade, Tommyinit)"
El rich MC ?
let's gooooooooooooooo
Am very jealous
You should do SSUNDEE next ???
Lizzzieee😭💗
oh my god adam’s mullet is,,,,, so powerful
Now this is an epic collab
YOOOO ADAM WAS ON HERE!
Where is captain sprinkles ;-;   (Still love and appreciate the video!!)
YOOOOO
No popularmmos? 😕
It’s like looking back into the past and seeing a bit of perspective of the Minecraft community starting out, then comparing it to how it’s doing now.  It’s really interesting how much things have changed, game wise and community wise
Please make a part 2 with others like ssundie, stampy and the guy who’s girlfriends name was Jen I can’t remember the name rn
s
Oh God i have never been this early. Hello everyone.
I love this already. All the good ones in one video!
uhm wheres dream? tommyinnit? wilbur? georgenotfound???
WAITTT ANTHONY
The Mc youtubers now are cringe
I wasn’t gonna watch because I’m tired and upset and so I thought hmmm I’ll watch it Lizzie is here and she was and now I have no choice but to watch, thank you
Finally, Dream SMP shit is no more (on anthonys channel, not all of youtube...although that would be a dream come true..)
YES! I practically screamed when I got the notification I remember watching all of them as kids and I still watch them now lol
You should do an episode called “ I spent a day with an Ex-Devil Worshiper” I watched a video about John Ramirez’s experience and it’s very interesting
HOW DARE *THOU* DISLIKE THIS LEGENDARY VIDEO
WHEN I SAW THIS I LOST MY SHAHAHHHSHHHit
I’m so glad you brought on DanTDM for this. He literally made my entire childhood and was one of my favorite youtubers to watch as a kid. Still as well tbh.
I wish BajanCanadian was on here since he's fallen off the YouTube path in recent years
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!!!!!
I remember wayy back when in 4th grade, laughing my ass off at skydoesminecraft’s do not laugh challenges. Good times.
I LOVE YOU PADILDO
Upset Stampy wasn't in the video. He raised me and millions ❤
Whats creative about anyone about this channel he left smosh cuz of creative differences right ? So what's so creative about just becoming a interviewer basically 🤔
I’ve never been more jealous of Anthony in my life
I clicked so fast when I saw Lizzie
Early = More Likes
ah imagine popularmmos and gamingwithjen were in this video 😭☝️
Nostalgia hit hard
OMG I AM SO HAPPY W/ THE CHOICES OML
You have no idea how much joy I have seeing Sky’s name in the title, his adventure on YT was amazing Greatest thing to happen is the moment he got his son back
When I saw Lizzie I got happy
This era of Minecraft >>>>>>>>>>  Captain Sparkles, Stampylonghead, PrestonPlayz...good times
Oh I remember them!
I hope There’s a herobrine section on this
early
BUDDDDDERRR
It's kinda crazy to think of LDShadowLady as a Legendary OG Minecrafter. I remember watching her when she had only a couple thousand subs.
HELL YEAH!
Woah, I'm early. Uh, insert funny comment here.
Day 1 of asking Anthony to do “Spending a Day with people with PTSD”
Not what we wanted but what we needed
Wow
The fact Etho isnt on this :'(
No stampy Disappointed
omg skydoesminecraft i'm getting such nostalgia i was obsessed
Omg I needed thisssss
Wow I literally watched all of these guys while I grew up Dang now I feel old
the excitement in my bones is immeasurable
Who else thinks Anthony’s video editing is AMAZING
Lizzie!!!!!!!
early gang here!
Dan , the king of mods
SkyDoesMinecraft is the one I blame for my childhood swearing problem
DanTDM was the first youtuber i ever subscribed to. Haven't watched his content in a few years though
Hearing dantdm is so nostalgic.
Where is the homie Jordan “CaptainSparklez” Maron
We all knew Dantdm would be on the show lol
No CaptainSparklez??? Probably a great video though
POGGG
Have a good day/night everyone!
Gotta click this man. Got to. Cannot resist.
Ello Anthony!
The crossover the we never knew we needed
Sadge CaptainSparklez noises
Ur a fart
ihascupcake, and ssundee, and stampy, and etc missing
Amazing so cool
where is stampy ;-;
I rememebers when DanTDM had 7 million subs back in 2015 and SkyDoesMinecraft was the biggest Minecraft channel with over 12 Million subs
This has always been my dream meeting all these famous mincrafte youtubers.ever since i was a kid
Dude, Dan is just amazing and this video is 🤌
I clicked for Dan  He was my childhood and I’ve recently started watching his newer vids
Whoever disliked dis vid is gay
Ah yes, Dan, the one person that got me through my childhood
I haven’t even watched the video yet and I’m so hyped- these creators raised me 😭

Everyone’s childhood in one video.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
I’m so excited!!!
I saw my childhood heroes and immediately clicked. Let's hope for the best 😭😭😭
