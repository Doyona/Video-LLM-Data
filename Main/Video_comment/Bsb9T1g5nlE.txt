Ah yes the universal cat in the hat ride
Little known fact: his daughter was one of the friends.. i think
Holy heck a wild Schalt appearance
Eddy needs to make a shirt of pour me something strong this door is to remain unlocked shirt
"oh shit, coolest motherfuckers on the planet" killed me for some reason
I can't believe you guys actually went into Rainforest Cafe and Ted didn't include it in his video
okay no love for the san diego location though?
Eddy I watched this video and your rainforest cafe video and last night I had a dream that I was you but I was still me but I was also a guy and I went on some video making trip with my best friend on a quest to get 100 followers and then at the end we were in this tiny cabin and then we were trapped in there for a few weeks? But it was okay we had food and Minecraft to play and people were on their way to get us out. But then my best friend revealed that he actually deleted all of our followers AND the Minecraft world because he was angry that I got 100+ followers on that trip while he had been “trying to get 100 followers for 52 years” (neither of us were in our 50s though??)
As an Oklahoman who’s been to our margaritaville! Heck yeah for it being good! Our little forgotten state finallly getting some love 🤣🤣🤣
I never understood why in these videos they don’t start going counter clockwise, that way they end on a high note. I’m not sure if that’s intentional for story, or just a lot less driving, but if it’s a circle either way, why not end closer to home and with better views?
I do not know anything in Europe inspired by a song, so this is kinda incredible to watch. I hope someone proves me wrong since I'm not too knowing of things outside my country either way. There is one pub in Czechia that is called after a fictional character in a Czech sitcom with merch and beer called after him, but other than that I have no idea tbh
Truly quite indeed
All 4 videos for this trip and the rainforest cafe trip are my comfort videos 😅
“You had self reflection during you having diarrhea?” Same Ted same
Definitely should have gotten the Jambalaya in louisiana
Love your content!   Biloxi is usually pronounced "Bil-uh-k-see"
It's coffin time somewhere 😂
Jimmy is dead anyway
Trashhhh
That hat makes you look like the smartest baby of 1996
47:12 is why I love living in a big city
Eddy discovering for the second time now that restaurant food is better in Canada lol.....I can't say I'm surprised
Love ya Eddie 🎉
Bubba Gump next 🙏 (if you do, pleaseee go to the WEM)
"The Thing" really changed in the 30 years since I was there last
I respect that you call it Bloomington and not Minneapolis. Everyone always says MOA is in Minneapolis and they’re just wrong 😂
america is truly terrifying
😂Got an ad for margarita before this video
as a non-american these videos are fascinating
I went to the one in Boston this summer and good god that was the worst restaurant service I’ve ever experienced in my life…buffalo wings were pretty good though
I just sat through and kept thinking when are they going to eat and drink something completely new at a different restaurant?
BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP
As a tourist in the US, I have one experience with the one in Cleveland. It was horrible. Food was bland and too much. So sloppy. My card wouldnt work. Over priced and also the cocktail bottle thing wouldnt close and I had to argue to get another one. Pasta with shrimps btw. Also the fish tacos, ass. There was also a chicken breast meal that was ass. Got shits and constipation at the same time.
Why do they need to chase each other out of the hotel room when they film.
I had to come back to this video bc, me and my 3 friends went to the margaritaville in niagara falls and all of us were just. SO sick afterwards. Like shitting and sweating and our stomachs were in PAIN.  But the experience in the restaurant, well, it was absolutely exhilarating.
Honestly, that dinosaurs vs. aliens exhibit find was a gem.
I can only compare the feeling of you doing this again to Katniss Everdeen being forced to fight in another hunger games
so glad you guys enjoyed Minnesota!
17:21 that kid sucks
this is my comfort video
This reminds me of lucas cruikshanks videos with his brother, they went to margaritaville & buckees & the rainforest cafe in a couple of their videos❤
it's like every location introduces you to a new insane kind of kitschy tourist attraction. you really get a taste of it all. i love it
I only remember him from that one episode of South Park where Cartman gets AIDS and Jimmy Buffett start singing AIDS burger
I bet you the Atlanta Georgia location though you guys were from corporate and only let you in after kitchen closed just incase it was a PR thing
What the hell, Jshlatt cameo? Damn 😂😅
god i hope he does another one of these
I don't know why but this video currently will not play for me. I can watch anything else, but not this 🤔
ok but that first hat really did go with his outfit and look pretty good
I am obsessed with this but am I insane for thinking there is a Margaritaville in Gatlinburg too? We only saw Pigeon Forge.
Syracuse mention let’s go
Rip Ted Nivison
the what if aliens museum killed me
rip
“Jimmy if you’re watching this..”  Me in 2025 😬😬
Was great to see the Syracuse Margaritaville only had like 6 people in it like usual.  That one was in the mall there for at least a decade and I've never seen more than 10 people in it before.  Couldn't believe is was open as long as it was but when it finally shut down for good last year....I couldn't believe it either
Next do the Hard Rock Cafe
Like how he say he take bribes said no when they reached out to sponsor him
22:37 braced for impact 😭✌️
We also learned that for Eddy a beautiful tropical beach is just that. And for Ted it’s navy pier and mall of america.
Ted wearing the THE THING tshirt thousands of miles away from its origin just a happy look on his face killed me
as a texan, the moment bucee's was mentioned i went "BUCEE'S" out loud and pumped my fist 😭 for the record, i AM embarrassed by this. why on earth does bucee's inspire this reaction in me
Now do Great Wolf Lodge
I live up near Syracuse, so funny seeing a place I know so well like destiny on your video 😂
waiting for the bubba gump trip to close out this masterpiece of a trilogy.
never in my life heard someone pronounce it bi-LOCKS-ee 😭
Do hard rock cafe lol
52:17 this escalated quikly
Bubba Gump's next?
I think what im realizing is that the real margarittaville are the friends we made along the way
I used to work right down the hall from the Syracuse Margaritaville. I never once ate there but Margaritaville was my greatest rival. They called me a fool but I knew…I knew that it had a dark secret…why was it almost always empty? Why didn’t they fill up the blender? Why did my friend keep lying to me and telling me the nachos were good?  Then it hit me…Destiny USA Margaritaville…was a money laundering scheme.   You see the reason why it was almost always empty (like geniunely empty I swear most of the time I didn’t even see anyone working) was because it wasn’t meant to be full. It existed for 1 reason and 1 reason only…to not pay its rent.   Every year, Margaritaville wouldn’t pay its rent to the mall, then the mall would sue them and take the money home. But the place stayed open. Do you know why? The owners of Destiny USA…owned the Margaritaville. They were suing themselves and taking their own money meaning that the money MUST be dirty somehow. It MUST be. I’m not crazy! I never have been! And when it closed everyone suddenly believed me! I had won!  But…my heart was heavy…as I stare now at its empty shell…I think of all the ramblings I made about that place…and I am sad. I am shocked but I can’t help but mourn my sworn enemy. My holy war…  “What do I do now?” I asked myself, as some strangers shoved past me, “is it…over?” Then a voice spoke to me.   “Wasting away again…” I turned and saw him…Jimmy…his ghost stood before me, a smile on his face. He raised his margarita to me and vanished into the big Beach in the Sky. And I smiled. I turned away from Destiny USA Margaritaville and prayed,  Rest in peace Jimmy, and Rest in Peace Destiny USA Margaritaville…my great beast to be slain…May you find rest…  God bless
6:27 mf i have ibs-
I think I just watched a coming of age movie?
The video that killed Jimmy Buffet
who else is watching this because their hungry?
A fitting couple of dudes, Backstabbing Burback and Hasan worshipping Ted travel together.
Pigeon Forge has become such a big tourist sink holy crap
55:14 Filming Ted like you're about to tell your 8 year old they actually *are* going to Disney is sending me
me and my mom drive from california to el paso and and from el paso to california every few months and we started screaming when “the thing” was mentioned
The margaritaville at ft. Myers doesnt have a margaritaville resfaurant. I was disappointed. They had an overpriced boring restaurant that i refused to go to. RiP Jimmy
Bahama breeze next
Hardrock cafe next please eddy you handsome dashing young man UwU
47:12 is so funny 🤣
To think, had they only done HALF the Margaritaville locations, Eddie would’ve been completely absorbed into the Jimmy cult
the fact that there’s a margaritaville in a Biloxi (which is another Buffet song) is incredible to me
Now try every McDonalds 😎
Skipped the Bossier la location
You skipped Jax Beach man
46:31 MISNY JUMPSCARE
46:31  As someone who lives in Lorain, OH, I know exactly who that guy is on the billboard.  Over the past several years I've watched him go from billboards that explain everything, to billboards with just his image along with "You know who I am and what I do", to being so ubiquitous that only his eyes are needed.
Ernest Hemingway too for Florida keys
Now all we need is an obscure spin off road trip series where they visit "every__ niche place" across the country
thank god you did this with ted again aweee
damn thats crazy you lucked out with atlanta that location is like one of the worst restaurants in the fucking world typically lmfao
Eddy hits the kuleshov like crazy man
I am scared for Eddy's life once they do every chuckee cheese in the country aaaaand Canadaaaa
Seeing eddy burback develop religious psychosis is crazy
We need another chain restaurant roadtrip
I think the only location I visited was the one in Las Vegas since themed restaurants aren't so common anymore and we don't eat at themed restaurants that much either. Although the the food is pretty good in the LV one, I noticed that after covid, the Volcano blender slide was retired and it mostly just has projections of videos that sometimes play. I even asked why that happened and I forgot the exact reason for this. (our waiter kind of knew about the Volcano slide history but maybe it was mostly covid's fault why waitresses could no longer perform stunts there)
What’s the next restaurant?
This is my comfort video
This video killed Jimmy Buffett
Going to every single one including malls back to back is self harm
Now do Hard Rock Cafe
"You can just forget about.. wars .. or famine... i mean, they're all still happening... but, im in Florida and i had a margarita today!..."  Lol
The sarcasm and shade in this video is stronger than the drinks, i swear. Lol
25:39 Chicken
Your amount of sarcasm scratches my brain just right ❤
Your amount of sarcasm scratches my brain just right
This is only the second video I’ve seen by this man, and he has become one of my all time favorite YouTubers
Ummm I know that this video is about margaritaville but there was a really good restaurant in the universal studios in Orlando called mythos it’s been featured in magazines. Don’t know if it’s still there as it’s been some time since I’ve been to Florida or
I like to pronounce “Buc-ees” as “boo-see’s”
10:01 his name is Thomas Binkley Prince
Thank you for doing that for us!
yo i think its time for another excursion friend 👀
https://youtu.be/Bsb9T1g5nlE?list=TLPQMzAwODIwMjWAAmBvtGW63A&t=3002 that's life changing shit man  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now they need to go on the Margaritaville cruise
Holy shit. There’s a sequel 😂
Where can I find your GF's song about Margaritaville?? I bet it's great haha.
hi! former Universal Orlando Team Member here! thank you so much for enjoying the park! to answer your Cat in the Hat question: no. children never come out the same again. it is a paywalled MK Ultra experiment funded by Mike Myers
Do Bubba Gump!
So when are yall going to every planet hollywood left in the USA 😂😂😂😂
i'm fascinated by the amount of 5 o'clock somwhere branding when it's an alan jackson song that jimmy buffet's only in for like thirty seconds. yes i hate that i know this. anyways congrats on setting his soul free or killing him or something lol
48:26 FEIN FEIN FEIN FEIN FEIN FEIN FEIN
I hope their next food adventure is every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant! :D
i went to a margaritaville for the first time on vacation a few months ago because of this video and it proved you right so bad. the margaritas ARE far too sweet. i hated mine 😭😭😭
Visit every single Buc-ee’s
Me watching and realizing there's Jarvis and Ted 😊 🫂
For next time, it’s pronounced biluxi LOL
Must be nice to be rich
As a Chicagoan myself, the guy at 47:12 is a good distillation of being in Chicago lol
Legendary video
Was the Margaritaville thing at the Georgia aquarium not around yet? I don't remember Ted mentioning it, and I haven't gotten to the Atlanta part in this video.
you have GOT to do this with bubba gumps
eddie, i know you're miserable, but please keep doing these videos they're so entertaining
When the first Rainforest cafe video came out, it was my video of choice to watch as I sat on the couch in my living room, wrapped up in a blanket, recovering from a cold with a bowl of warm pumpkin soup.  Today, I was in the same spot on the couch with another pumpkin soup nestled on top of the blanket I had. ...Then the memories came flooding back.  "Wait, I wonder what Eddy Burback (The Rainforest Cafe Guy) is doing... Didn't he go to every MargaritaVille in America?"  And here I am. Great to have you here as a way to take my mind of the sickness, dude. Even if it is 2 years late. RIP, Jimmy Buffet
🪦safari fries D:
Are we seeing chilis next?👀👀👀👀
Um are you willingly try all the Bubba Gump restaurants?
I live about 30 minutes from Pigeon Forge and it was funny to me seeing all this stuff I’m used to in the video, like “hey I’ve seen all that a million times” 😂 I think if you ever get the chance you should come back in the summer and try both Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country 😂
here to watch the MOA location. who else came to watch a specific location?
In celebration of Jimmy you should go on the Margaritaville Cruise.
Every hard rock cafe in the world next
Now do every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country
In PCB deciding to go to Margaritaville and knew this would be the best review I could watch.   I knew I could search your name, I knew Eddy Burback was the one who made the video.  I still searched “every Margaritaville”  for the bit
52:52 love of my life
Michael is so majestic
There is a Margaritaville in KC MO now👀
Next year you should try McDonalds in every country on the globe
hey jarvis
update: the syracuse margaritaville has since been closed down
❤
Bad frying oil can cause tummy trouble
Omg I just went to buccees for the first time a couple weeks ago and I lost my bestie! It was exactly like you described😭
But Eddy, what about the Air Margaritavilles located in various airports?
I don’t understand why but this video is a comfort video for me.  I can rewatch it with ease so thanks Eddy
update on the syracuse location in the destiny usa mall. it is now closed  rip to the worst one
Plz do the Hard Rock Cafes next
DO BUBBA GUMP!!!!!!!! THEY HAVE THEM ALL AROUND THE US!!!
"Final" he says,  until they decide to do every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the US (it's 21 locations)
You miss one in Hawaii on Oahu. Obviously you can’t drive there but I’m just saying… I stayed there for an entire week I didn’t book the hotel…
0:00 song?
Next stop, Hard Rock Cafe!!
Pour one out for the Syracuse Destiny Mall Margaritaville. I had a really terrible chicken sandwich at you once. I hope some teenagers made off with pieces of blender </3
You never went to the one in the Lake of the Ozarks???? Why has no one mentioned this. This video is fake news
"Fins up Jimmy!" Has become a vocal stim for me
You need to go on a margaritaville at sea cruise now
You mispronouncing Biloxi kind of disturbed me a little idk
Can’t wait for the Forrest Gump road trip!
You should visit all 27 six flags amusement parks next
ive walked past a Margaritaville in boston and now i feel awful bc ive existed in the same area this man has previously existed in
29:51 R6 Warden elite skin lookin ass eddy.
this is definitely too much margaritaville for a man to handle, but you definitely powered through.
Waiting for the every Hard Rock Cafe video!
i almost got a concussion on the cat in the hat ride as a kid... traumatizing
If I had a nickel for every Justin Bieber reference in this video, I’d have 2 nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice
Did Chrissy dump this guy?
I didn't know billionaire investor Warren Buffet owned actual buffets
At 48.25 that is your album cover if you and your friends ever make music
Fell asleep and this autoplayed i had a dream centered around margaritaville
I can’t believe eddy killed jimmy buffet
He ate at every Margaritaville in the Country. It's sad, dude, it's sad.
12:25 Flashbacks
Eat at every Chuck E Cheese?
46:31 ...typical cleveland jumpscare. misny looms.
43:36 I was **title card**
I hope these clowns weren't drunk driving😟
As a french person who didn't know what Margaritaville was before watching this video, I feel like this perfectly encapsulates american culture lol  also how is a whole burger an entrée ?? aren't entrées supposed to be starters ? i'm so confused
Yall should go to every Hard rock Cafe
Medieval times?
I've watched this at least 5 times and it's still great!
Hard rock carfe enters the chat
52:50 "You look lonely… I can fix that" Ah scene 💀
The multiple PTSD flashbacks Eddy goes through whenever he's in close proximity to a Rainforest Cafe says a lot about how much that trip broke him. LOL
Sorry but what is a golf of mexico 14:30
of course not long after 911 was mentioned, "jschlatt" appears
of course not long after 911 was mentioned, "jschlatt" appears
Honestly rest in peace Jimmy, but hell he would love this video
WJWD lololol I was hoping this was goin this way
Going to every medieval time dinner and tournament
I just want love
I was there
Next you should go to all the remaining Chuck E. Cheese’s in the USA.
I went to the Ac margheritaville today. Then hopped a train home
43:44 OPTIMUS PRIME
i love how your mood was dependent on how hungover you were
Ok Danny looks like he just saw his parents die and is on the brink of crying
You didnt go to the one in St. Thomas
These videos just make me want to go to Niagara falls again. It's a great time to wander around and look at animaronics and drink in weird restaurants.
Ya’ll skipped the Lake Conroe margaritaville resort!
Apps are entrees and entrees means mains. It took me the whole video wondering why he was eating two entreesl
Constipation ville
I watched this so many time and I only just realized that on day 3 Ted is warning a “the thing” t shirt
Lol I came here straight after the Rainforest video on Ted's channel because I couldn't believe you would do this to yourself again 😂😂 I'm loving these
PLEASE do every McMenamin’s in the PNW I’ll pay you $5
I REALLY hope Eddie Burback and Ted Nivison become the "Going To Every Blank" guys in the same way that Keith Habersberger became the "Eat Everything At Blank" guy
I need you to go to every bubba gump shrimp now
Danny being dressed for the occasion again is fantastic
This video is now incomplete the margarita vill in MA just opened
Very interesting issue, as always informative and fun
37:25 I work the strip in wisconsin dells and you give it too much credit lol
Bro why would you even do this a second time when the first time drove you insane
Imagine if margaritaville had an All you can eat Jimmy Buffet
23:20 how the fuck do you not even mention the fact that all of these islands are connected by highway to eachother and the mainland? wtf America.
RIP Jimmy Buffett
When in San Antonia, should've gone to the Alamo to see the basement.
For a place called Margaritaville you'd think they would at least get the margaritas right
Nothing cures a psychotic episode like watching another person have a psychotic episode
Binkley is actually his middle name. His first name is Tinkley. Tinkley Binkley Prince
20:18 I was about to say that the rain ISINT THAT bad like in teds video but then you called me out ;-;
"Now that's a Buffett burn" is a common vocal stim of mine
Pt 3: we went to all of the Buc-ee's
yall forgot the one in tahoe
This episode of man does thing goes crazy
not the hand grenades.....
24 days? that’s like reverse rehab
Your girlfriend is gorgeous btw (I’m a girl I can say that)
I don’t know if the Margaritaville in the island was in here but that’s the Margaritaville I know
The fact that you stayed at a Margaritaville in TIMES SQUARE is dedication not seen since the Rainforest Cafe Rampage
Can't believe this is how I found out the Margaritaville at Westgate in Arizona closed :( RIP Coyotes
I wonder when Eddy and Ted are going to all of the Hard Rock locations?
Excited for the "visiting every great wolf lodge"
i love how eddy is just losing it with Ted without Ted realizing at all
Bruh, I saw Tim Misney in the video and I immediately died of laughter
coke. coke is how jimmy sustains this lifestyle 😂😂😂
i don't see "jimmy buffet's likeness plastered across the entire restaurant" so that's kinda disappointing or you used the wrong video for that part of the VO 😒
can you go to every hard rock cafe this year pls
So what, Hard Rock Cafe next? I’m thinking Hard Rock Cafe!
43:00
Now do it with medieval times
PLEASE do every cheesecake factory 😈
Hey um do yall know some guy named Montan is uploading your content to their page?
Can you do hooters or hoots next lol
28:01 why is the footage reversed
every tim hortons next
They opened a new Margaritaville Resort in Lake Tahoe, gotta make a trip!
Perfect video to watch on the toilet for an hour
47:09 this is the moment i realized that eddies been with youtuber Ted Nivison this entire time and not his brother Tony 😭
I actually come from where the first Buccees started! Seeing it in videos of people *not* from this area is weird. Even within the state lol
i want that shirt back, it's so cute
I find it interesting that neither of these videos have brought you to the northwest at all.
8:17 it’s fantastic
Why would you choose a Tacoma for a road trip?
truly a harrowing depiction of whats its like to find and then lose faith while witnessing someone else find the faith you lost.
Now eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in America
i gotta just say it, you ate buffalo poutine of course your gonna be shitting your pants the next day. cant blame that on margaritaville.
The only thing I learned was that I’ve been to 19 different margaritavilles and also sat at the same table in PCB and Destin
So did you try everything on the menu? It seemed like there were a lot of repeats.
39:03 i don’t think this is the best thing to watch while being deadly hungover
Omg! Eddie Ninepins killed Jimmy Buffett.
RIP Syracuse NY Margaritaville, it may have been terrible but it was still Margaritaville (it closed down)
12:07 You're welcome
Win for Biloxi!!!!
46:48 bro I laughed HARD and laughed many times before this moment too, just had to comment you’re one funny dude, dude. Thanks for the laughs! You know how important they are these days. Meaning yes I’m 30s yrs old too 😢 joke from the previous video of your I just watched. New sub boiiii keep it up! Thanks for making this!
39:38 LMAOOOO
This video has popped up in conversation with my mother multiple times. Every single time it is brought up, she always tells me that her and my stepdad had their first date at a margaritaville
Obviously, you just did this for a tax write off. /s
"one sec babe, i gotta film myself having a ptsd flashback in front of the rainforest cafe"
9:39 this omost reminded me of what JSCHLAAT did in 1999
It was quite humbling to watch such an incredible and experienced electronic musician I've listened to for over a decade struggle with something that seems so simple. Good try. 3/10. I liked the glitchy direction it was going maybe 12 more hours were needed. Also EPROM, and Woulg & zebbler encanti might make some drops you're into.
Now yall should do every Benihana in North and South America. Then not only would you hold a niche record, but you’d actually go insane!
This is so devastating because the Margaritaville in my town opened the same year this video came out
That museum is awesome
Food doesn’t look that bad for chain restaurants
40:58 why does Ted look extra hot here?
I love the zoom in on Tim Misney’s eyebrows (it’s a northeast Ohio inside joke for a lawyer)
Eddy when are we getting all the Medeival Times or Bubba Gump Shrimp Co?
Please don't tell me you're doing this to yourself again this year
Gulf of 'Mexico'??..... Boy this video didn't age well.....
I've had this video idea but I never would've been brave enough to go through with it, thank you for your sacrifice 21:57 I wasn't expecting you to fall in love with Jimmy Buffet, plot twist
brother... you know yer gf is there for................ omg your personality is amazing.....
32:54 hell yea brother that’s were im from!
I came here to learn what it was like to eat at margaritaville, and ended up learning what it was like to have friends… I wish I had friends 😅
I've never eaten at a Margaritaville but I did suffer from food poisoning at the mall of america in that exact spot so in a way I feel connected to you Eddy
I love these types of videos because i live hours from any Rainforest Cafes or Margaritavilles so i get to live vicariously through Eddie (even if he goes insane doing it)
This came on while i was asleep and i had a dream that ben stiller was trying to take me on a date to Margaritaville. Very strange.
I literally worked IT for these stores.
There's a margaritaville in jurassic world
i will always find it baffling how food makes every American sick lol. I have never ever as a European felt unwell after dining out, and when I have its been full blown food poisoning that passes in like a day. WHAT IS IN THE FOOD?
you killed jimmy
I'm now worried for the safety of the Canadian Margaritaville.
Puerto rico has one
I just feel so sorry for your liver! All those margaritas!
Seeing both of these videos back to bad is such a trip. Getting the true differemce in feelings.
You had time for both Disney and Universal, but not Dollywood? I find that hard to believe.
i cannot fathom driving from cali to pigeon forge and not going to dollywood 😢
This video killed jimmy
14:34  GULF OF AMERICA 🦅🦅🦅🦅
35:00 hope the tip was good, I can't believe they did that
Just watching this now and realized Jimmy died about 40 days after this was posted. He must've died happy knowing that someone tried every single one of his restaurants. What a heartfelt video.
Hey something new you still have to Check out! Margaritaville at Sea!
hey eddy, bubba gump’s has 22 locations in the US
this is my comfort youtube video now
Damn the Thing used to just be an outdoor walk along antique museum that led to the same “mummy”. Seeing the aliens stuff was absolutely shocking .
Imagine if the world gets destroyed and the thing that is the only thing left to tell us about our human civilization
47:11 My head canon is that Danny was the one hyping them up here
Update: The Syracuse location has permanently closed
29:10 "I'm not EATING dinner right now"  I fucking love Drew
Six months after this released my wife and I minimooned at the resort in Orlando right after our wedding in the North Orlando Suburbs and it was fantastic. Plus we got all the Rest in Peace Jimmy memes.... Love you Jim I poured out half of my tall and strong for you.
Tim Misney spotted
It's very reassuring knowing that, should I someday choose to go to a Margaritaville establishment anywhere in the US, i can rest easy know that Eddy Burback has been there before.
legit got a margaritaville obsession in 8th grade from this video lmao
stephen a smith popped up alot on your trip
“You’re all good pal…. Have a great time” is perfect for a jimmy buffet margarita induced hallucination  Also I have now become a Jimmy buffet Believer and love his music unironically
Gutted the Margarita shirt isn't still available
When you became miserable and Ted began enjoying himself  Was when the Spirit of Jimmy™️ left your body and entered him
46:17 The moral of these travel videos is clearly that Niagara falls canada is always the superior location to visit 🤣
A very funny video would be like “Visiting every T-Rex restaurant in the USA” because isn’t it just the one in Downtown Disney Orlando
14:33 *gulf of america 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
the first 15 minutes kinda freaked me out a little. i just went to san antonio to visit my brother who’s in the air force and we walked the river, and we went to the same buc-ees in texas, and we will be going to biloxi, MS to visit my brother again because he’s doing tech school. just all those being the first few stops on his trip was a little silly to me.
Love the completely uncommented-upon fact that Ted is wearing a "The Thing?" t-shirt at 36:50
This whole saga reads like Eddy Burback vs. undiagnosed IBS
Veil! Thank you so much for this!! I'm curious how these concepts apply to faces specifically?  Either way, i will be taking on this journey🫡
I wish cosa bonita had restraunts in other states i would so ask for a food tour on casa bonita
Eddy when will you do a 'I decorate my living room' vid
i’m from mexico and i’ve played Stinky Feet so i can say that it is international
Yall getting annoyed with each other more and more as the trip goes on 😂
Jimmy Buffet died two months after this video was uploaded. Thanks, Eddy 😢
Just wait til he finds out the meaning behind Jimmys song Jamaica Mistake-a
What about the one in Honolulu?
Eddy goes to every Hard Rock Cafe????!!!!!
Eddy, I just want to say that when I tore my ACL last year, underwent surgery for 4 hours, and came home drugged up and unable to walk. I binged almost all the videos on your channel while couch ridden. I played your videos so much however, that my mom was like "this guy isnt even funny." Long story short, I just wanted to say now post-recovery that watching your videos gave me some semblance of comfort knowing someone was torturing themselves for my entertainment. Especially this video. Thank you.
Wacky idea next trip should be around the world for all known location of Bubba Gump chain resturants
Every time I see the thumbnail for this video I think the Margaritaville icons are a bunch of Samus Aran helmets
official petition for you to visit EVERY Buccees in the country.
do bubba gump next
I’ve watched this more times than I care to admit.
We used to have Margaritaville near us in Wisconsin, and it was probably one of the most underwhelming dining experiences I've ever had, especially given how much my in-laws raved about it.
I want you to know that I sort of understand the Jimmy Buffett delirium that you went through. In the summer of 2020, mid-covid, I worked at a dying Bed Bath & Beyond, 8 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and then went home to sleep on a couch every night. I hated the job the entire time. For a while, any time I would go on my lunch break, I would sit in my car and listen to "It's Five O' Clock Somewhere" by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett on loop for about half an hour at a time. I do not listen to country music. During these moments, I felt the spirit of Jimmy flow through my body and mind, easing all of my worries and bringing me a moment of respite. Truly, no matter what time it was, and what I was going through, it was 5 o'clock somewhere. Thanks for reminding me of the Jimmy zone.
Why did Ted look like he actually did it 😭
You should go to every bubba gump shrimp in the country for your next trip.
This video gave me horrible acid reflux. I hope you're proud of yourself.
Diarrheaville. I'll just leave this here.
You only visited one Margaritaville in texas!! You didnt even go to the resort in Conroe Texas!!
48:23 weezer
Bet you won't eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the US, you coward!
RIP Jimmy Buffett
Seeing him in pcb js such a fever dream cuz it's like I live there whats the chance I walked right past these 2 😭😭
Someone tell this man to invest in a bottle of tums
16:20 blessed by the Jimmy oracle
Watching this at work so I can pretend I’m on a cross country trip with friends instead of sitting in a dark quiet office working the graveyard shift and waiting for time to pass
Much less driving to go to every Denny's in California.
I want eddy to eat at every Denny’s in the USA and get a grand slam which at every single one
Just want to say that I checked and they didn’t leave a good yelp review for the Atlanta one. I’m disappointed
I love Jimmy buffet rip man
Loving seeing peeps go to San Antonio
12:49 BUCEES MENTIONED RAAAAAAHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK IS WAITING FOR A BATHROOM 🦫🦅🚽⬜⭐🟥🟦
34:20  what did u expect
Guys this is only the second video of Eddy's I've seen. Does he lie so much all the time? The other video was the Ghost Kitchens video.
in Myrtle beach when the thunderstorm happens, margarita mix comes out of the tornado and fills up the blender.
The whole concept of Margaritaville - restaurants, resorts, casinos - is ticking to expiration as Parrotheads die off. No one under 60 gives two fucks about Jimmy Buffett.
Americans are so funny why do you need a whole pickup truck for a two people road trip hahshahah
i cant believe this video killed jimmy buffett
update on the syracuse NY margaritaville: it closed
28:50 fun fact about Jimmy Buffett, he started the save the manatee club which I donated to for most of my childhood because I love manatees.
28:49 ain’t no way bro was at the living seas pavilion at Epcot💀
About time for another round? I hear Margaritaville has a cruise ship.
I’ve probably already said it but thank you Eddie for pulling off I-10 to look at THE THING so I could finally put my own temptation to rest
Such a noble quest
Coming to this having not seen the rainforest cafe video... his face seeing the sign made me ask, "Who hurt you at the rainforest cafe?" 😂 now I guess I'm going to have to find out. Well played.
You should do McDonald's next
Boooo. You didn't accept Keith's invite to Eat the Menu?? BOOOOOO.
21:25 I’m late as hell to this, but was not expecting the Wisconsin Dells shoutout… as someone who also had family trips there as a midwestern kid lol
I think we moved on from The Thing too quickly?
The amount of times I have watched this video is…a lot. It’s my asmr sleep video, my comfort vid.
You guys missed the one on Isla Nublar!
I have come back to this video so many times it gives me so much joy 😂
I know artistic/creative minds like yours despises remaking the same idea but please, a final part to the trilogy whether good or bad before  you stop looking like you are plwease 🥺.
cant wait for "the second and final time" to be the 2nd in a trilogy
It’s kinda sad that their is not gonna be more of these but i still would love bubba gump shrimp  for them to go to all of them but that’s probably not gonna happen :<
Georgia hospitality in Atlanta
Glad you made it to the Syracuse Margaritaville before it closed 🥲
There’s one in Puerto Rico which is usa soil so u didn’t go to every margaritaville in the usa
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE IN FORT MYERS BEACH! It was open at that time after hurricane Ian!!!!!!!!! U suck!
Do Bubba Gump next
Yeah welcome to Syracuse.
Alternate title: Eddy becomes an Alcoholic
Hollywood beach is easily the best margaritaville for me I have gone so many times
Whenever I see the bridge at 32:32 I get incredibly nostalgic. That’s the bridge we’d drive on to see Dad at work at CPM credit union. I’ll always recognize all of the SC landmarks. That state is home like no other and it’s the greatest place on earth.
Every Cheesecake Factory when?
seeing them go to the Riverwalk and the river city mall is just surreal because it's in my area lmao
Pst. Hey Eddy. There are only 10 Medieval Times locations.
heres a thought. every bass pro shop in california.
He died 2 months after
God this video is a masterpiece
You should go to every Dick’s Last Resort next
as a non-american i never realized just how much decor there is everywhere. everything seems giant and over the top and i keep thinking where do these corporations get the money to pay for such impressive animatronics and fake planes and giants animals etc., let alone maintenance of them. same goes with the malls
Did you find the lost shaker of salt?
The fact he blurred out his feet on the beach to stay consistent with his narration is gold 😅
The one in Biloxi, Mississippi is my fav (at 14:22). I love the building and the location at the beach
at the time of making this comment, the las vegas margaritaville has been permanently closed
I'm very concerned that you didn't go to the Miami Airport Margaritaville....
Did you go to the capitola one? That’s the original! These are all jimmy Buffet which ripped that one off! I work there 😎
Jimmy doesn’t take bribes anymore
do medieval times next
i'm not a huge fan of alcohol but i had my first margarita on my honeymoon last week and it reminded me of this fever dream of a video so i started rambling to my husband about it on the beach lol. i don't think he cared but i do. i care eddy
HOLY SHID this just made me realize that one of my core traumatic childhood memories was set in a margaritville.
syracuse ny mentioned 😱😱😱
Got to redo it. Forgot to hit up the one in Conroe Texas
We need more of these road trip videos!
I'm Australian and these videos helped me distinguish between Jimmy and Warren Buffet
When you were saying city walk I thought you were saying  'city wok' for half the video. Like from South Park
RIP Jimmy
Will never fail to confuse me that Americans call entrees 'appetizers' and main courses are called 'entrees'
Reliving this beautiful adventure from your perspective
Seeing Ted in denial about a truck remind me of Hank hill 😭
I feel the next logical thing is to eat at every bubba Gump shrimp!
I am sorry you suffer on these road trips but I must consume more restaurant roadtrip content from you.
This guy is named Burback and hes talking shit about somebody named Binkley.... A bit like the pot calling the kettle black
I live near the Mall of America and have been to that Rainforest Cafe on more than one occasion - and have never in my life noticed the Margaritaville there
Someone let Eddy know that the Syracuse location has CLOSED!
The one in syracuse is now closed
When are you going to visit every Olive Garden location?
alternate title: fear and loathing in Margaritaville
Hard Rock Cafe next
Tim Misny will make them pay
Congratulations the Syracuse margarita ville just closed down!
It's a shame the Glendale Arizona location closed in 2014.  I used to live right next to it, you guys probably would have driven next to my old house had you gone 😂
I went to the Biloxi one very good
The Key West Margaritaville was the first one I ever went to, and I think this is a sign I started on the right foot.
RIP to the Syracuse Margaritaville
pangolin god tier
I live in Tulsa and in the airport they have a hole wall in the main terminal with Margaritaville all over it
Eddie being surprised there’s a bunch of Jimmy stuff in a jimmy restaurant 😂
I remember seeing the hurricane one as a kid, I kinda thought I was tripping lmao
Its one of those places you go to once a year or 10 years just to experience
I am quite sad to see that the hurricane party at Myrtle beach was not a hilight 😢
Me at 0:30: "Wow that's so stupid why would you go to the same restaurant that many times."  Me now: "I gotta check out some Jimmy Buffett music."
Was that the Hinsdale Oasis? Sometimes I miss Chicago but then I go back to visit for 3-4 days and I have had absolutely enough. I can't wait to get back to Vegas. I was having a hard time when my husband passed and my mom said "maybe you will have to move back." UM.. I'm here with 50 degree winters. Do you think I want to go somewhere that has "artic blasts?" Negatory lady. I can't believe the Margaritaville here closed. I think eventually they will all go away now that he is gone.
Hey what’s the song at 1:25 ?
No one will care, Im at the margaritaville atlanta rn. Manager is great
Bimmy Juffet
They just announced that the Syracuse location is closing.
It’s rumored the universal Hollywood is closing 😢
52:58 "You look lonely..."
38:54 looks like ya got two, half smoke cigarettes in ur drink there bud. I will assume that it part of the MV experience
that one unemployed friend at 3PM on a tuesday
I'm a bit disappointed that they are so mediocre as Jimmy Buffet really seems to have been a nice guy and I thought he would have higher standards! oh well. Hope you have since recovered!
Now go do every Bubba Gump’s in America
7:40 what truck bed? There’s nothing there?
22:09 You encountered a Cyberpunk 2077 NPC in real life
Insane to to go to Atlanta and not plan 3-4 hours ahead for traffic
BIH-LOCKSEE MISSISSIPPI lmao  buh-luck-see is the way we say it
34:00 - Atlanta here, hope you like traffic cause that's what yall are getting.
on wikipedia??? under “in popular culture” too????
I am here waiting for this dude to say he went to every Margaritaville in existence and he literally did it in 45 seconds.   Fuck I love this man
Super Size Me for Millennials: Margaritaville Edition
When I went to universal me and my sister went on that cat in the hat ride. I can confirm it's terrifying. Our ride stopped in the middle of it and it was just silent for five minutes.
Fun Massachusetts fact: about a year after the Boston one opened, we got ANOTHER Margaritaville like an hour away on Cape Cod. This one’s a full resort and I had to bring a bunch of wedding cakes there during the renovation. Pushing my little delivery cart through the unfinished hallways of a half-built margaritaville has got to be one of the most surreal experiences of my life.
Do Texas Roadhouse next.
55:28 That's not a Cheetah.
"its not about what I want... its about what jimmy would do!"
Next up: Bubba Gumps!
my friends and i (a group of myself and three other people) went to bucees after a road trip for a convention, and we got seperated several times in a number of different orientations
Pretty sure he missed Conroe TX
Is a third trip coming up?
A few weeks after this video came out I went to Tombstone Arizona for a Red Dead Redemption convention. As I drove along the road I noticed a sign for... The Thing. I begged my father to go but he said no... It was not on our way unfortunately... I fell asleep in the car disappointed. Only to wake up... To the front doors of The Thing.
Please do every Bubba Gump Shrimp
LETS GO TULSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My dad took a picture of me @ universal with the plane in the background, making it look like I was holding it up at age 7-just now finding out that was Jimmy’s plane 19 years later 😮
These videos should all be compiled into the "Tax Deduction Chronicles"
schlatt jumpscare
U should  Go to every McDonald's
I need Eddy and Ted to visit Casa Bonita
Was at the Boston mass one late into the school year last year thanks to a field trip to the Boston market, tempted me.
its funny that the best margaritaville is probably in Canada, and its kinda obvious because US fastfood is trash in US but its kinda good outside US
30:54 "I found her, your mother, your mother is here!" crazy burn from the Cat in a children's attraction.
assuming the lifespan of 80 years, the 44 days you spent on that trip are approximately 0.15% of your whole life btw
Somehow, in the last year and a half, three MORE margaritavilles (AND a RESORT) have opened in Missouri and Iowa. How?!?!
He also visited every Margaritaville in Luxembourg.  Ps. Seems this Jimmy Buffet is pretty egotistical, self-centered guy. Pps. 22:11 That guy might be on drugs. Just a hunch.
As a fellow person from El Paso we love you thank you for your service
How you feeling Eddie?
There’s a margarita Ville in the US Virgin Islands they missed one
the way the intro gave me chills when this is literally a video about a chain restaurant lmaoo
The Gatlinburg location in TN is the best
omg i was waiting for one that i’d eaten at in connecticut but it permanently closed like 6 years ago </3
48:23 weezer
Ted looks like Eddy’s ill-behaved son half the time
This is one of the longest yt videos I've watched fully and also the one I rewatch most. So long but so refreshing every time I watch it
optimus prime jumpscare
Why do you have so many views despite 2 million subs and 85 videos and why did I come across you so late despite you being friends with most of the content creators I'm watching 🤨 suspicios.
Ummm! https://www.margaritavilleresorts.com/margaritaville-hotel-kansas-city
How yall didn’t get alcohol poisoning is craaaazy
The flashbacks I got during the bucees run- holy shit balls is working there a nightmare 😨💀
How have I never heard of Jimmy Buffet?
Canada has the best restuarants. The strip at niagra is fun lots of places to go eat at on the strip
i lived the jimmy party life for too long lmfao idk how hes done it his whole life, once i got 25 it was too much lmfao sleeping a couple hours a night and partying everyday
32:56 - If that's within 500 miles of Syracuse, ill eat at a Margaritaville.
Nobody: My 21st birthday plans:
This is my Jimmy Buffet memory. When I was like 20 or so my mom got free tickets at Madison square garden. I remember that there were a lot of ppl with Hawaiian shirts and my parents knew of jimmy but more so for the free tickets. I brought a friend and we stayed for a couple of songs. Heard cheeseburger in paradise and was like this musician is weird. Cut a year or so later and saw a margaritaville and was more flabbergasted at who is this musician to open up restaurant… and then when I saw a second one I was like this is a chain!   Idk this sure was a dumb trip with shitty food but it’s like seven degrees of Kevin bacon lol…damn I feel old   Great video as always
I love how when he did Rainforest Cafe, he lost his mind, but in this one he lowkey started a Jimmy Buffet cult
At buccees you werent experiencing what its like to be lost as a child, you were experiencing what its like to lose a child as an adult.
Is your girlfriend single?
You need to do every bubba gump shrimp. It is the only path forward. 😂
That opening goes so hard
You didn't go to the margaritaville in Puerto Rico.
Lol so weird to see this dude passing through my little Georgia town for margaritaville. Fun fact-- Jimmy Buffett is a legend in the aviation industry! Near Hilton head he has his own base thingy named after him; he used to frequent my town for the masters and everyone at the airport knew him. He was genuinely such a kind guy. Ask any person at the airport and they will tell you how lovely he is
time for every hard rock cafe in the us and canada
do cheesecake factory next, it'll take years
i hope they do bubba gump shrimp co or maybe hard rock cafe
now do medieval times <3
How much money did y’all spend on gas?
people on the gulf coast LOVE jimmy buffet he is considered a native <3
I knew he was going to hate the Syracuse one. It’s barely a margaritaville.
At the new margaritaville hotel in San Diego and thought of this video
Hard rock cafe next
Went to Cleveland and didn’t even have a topical experience at the beaches of Lake Erie, smh
If I had to eat Margueritaville, I would load up on the jammin jerk shrimp.
I'm not sure if it was only a local thing or a big chain but there was another jimmy buffet themed place called Cheeseburger In Paradise (another popular song of Buffet)
I went to the Margaritaville at Universal Citywalk in Florida.  They handed me parrots to pose with while we waited outside.  Right as the photographer took the picture, the parrot leaned over and clamped down on my nipple.    They refused to sell me the picture.  It was the only theme park picture that I ever actually wanted to buy.
you should eat at every outback steakhouse in the US and abroad
Me, and my husband's family, may or may not have gotten food poisoning from the San Antonio Mall Margaritaville.
What about the airport margaritavilles?
someone get this man a cardiovascular sponsorship after this trip
The Rainforest Café PTSD lmao 🤣🤣🤣
rip Jimmy 🙏
Imagine visiting every Chuck E. Cheese
48:30 even the bean couldn't stop... my TUMMY from HURTING. Loved this part, I produced the grandest of cackles.
11:39 from the UK...that is NOT Fish n chips.
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
JARVIS SPOTTED
Buddy is a good doggy
5:32 yk i might sound crazy but I don’t think he is
My best friend has the Margaritaville margarita machine, and it is AMAZING! It hands down makes the best margaritas!
You’ve made some of the most rewatch able content. Thanks. Kingdom hearts video is everything. Thanks for everything.
now do every McDonalds
Aw fuck yeah I’m glad you had a good experience in Atlanta, even if you also had to suffer Atlanta traffic
damn Jakey bit Justin’s line “when i was thirteen i found my first love”
“Bi LAH xi”
I dunno I've been a few margaritavilles and I think they're pretty decent
UPSTATE NEW YORK MENTIONED. Had my birthday at that mall
So steeped in millennial hipster irony
More Justin bieber references pls
Do Bubba Gumps next PLEASE!!!
Unblur the toes.
I went to New York just for margaritaville
This is amazing.... Should be a actual series. I'd watch
The mall of America gave me trama...I was like 5 and got a nose bleed.after hitting my nose of the lap bar of a ride...I never trusted a.coaster again till 2022
Jimmy “mr beast” can only dream of a whole jimmy restaurant
I had to google margaritaville near me - There’s a hotel by my local beach
It's every Hard Rock Cafe next, right boys?
Bill-Ux-Ee
its so weird to see them at a bucees ive visited multiple times 😅 but thats bucees for you!! always poppin'
I come back to this video more often than I’d like to admit 😂
Yall should go to every six flags in the US
Bubba gump shrimp next!!
The day you had self reflection is the same day you had diarrhea the most true line that this video
Eddy flipping off Rainforest Cafe Took me out 😆🍻
i remember going to the Margaritaville with my family in Niagara Falls and neither my dad nor i ate our burgers because they only cook them well done
Watched the whole video to see the only margaritaville I've ever been to on lake ozark in Missouri only to find out dude in fact didn't go to every margaritaville
Ted is so Garrett Watts coded
Hard Rock Cafe next
It's extra funny to me that Anish Kapoor hates it when people call it "the bean" but fuck that guy, it's the bean now
Fins up jimmy!!
Guaranteed the "what are the chances" guy was just stalking you lmao.  God, being a YouTuber must be bizarre.
Amazing
Congrats for surviving this journey. Now do every Hardrock Café.
Waiting for the day Ted and Eddie take on every Buc-ees in the country
Next has to be hard rock cafes
I stayed at the same place in Mississippi!!
Eddy Please do a roadtrip of going to every buccees in texas !!!
Shiiiii, those aliens where kinda cakes up, if I was there it would be hard not to act up
I remember stepping off the cruise ship in Cozumel Mexico and the first thing I saw was a Margaritaville restaurant. Immediately thought of this video
As someone not from the USA, I had never heard of cult leader James Buffet until this video.
Do McDonald’s next
I only went to Orland once as a small child. You unlocked nightmares I had as a child. Not what I expected from a video on the restaurants based on only the best song ever
I got so excited when he went to the Syracuse one cause that mall is like 15 minutes from me. started crying laughing when he described it and felt regretful that I am from Syracuse. thanks ed
Day 1 of asking Eddy to do this again but with Medieval Times
And “finale” roadtrip😂 uh huh see ya next year buddy
Rewatching this little series from both Ted and Eddy, and damn the Bladerunner score at 52:00 during Eddy’s little breakdown is just fantastic
Ngl, was kinda weird not seeing another dumb road trip video this year  I get why there wasn't one, but it still feels weird
14:49 holy shit i think i had a dream about being in this place. i have never stepped foot in biloxi in my life
Until they go to every Hard Rock Cafe.
Currently celebrating my 21st in the Nashville margarita ville. Ty Eddie
"some last second recording" yeasure buddy got a hooker
I just went to my first ever Margaritaville(in key West) and immediately re watched this video
Last time I went to Chicago I missed my chance to see the bean :( thanks for rubbing salt in the wound eddy >:( (/j)
U didn’t even show the giant flip flop or the parrots in Tennessee smh
theres a new one coming to kansas city. im begging you mr burback, round 2
You should eat at every Cheesecake Factory in the country
Hard rock cafe next
they lowkey look like the low-budget beatles in that one bean pic...
do u guys think anyone has ever offered to pay for eddy foot pics like actually
I'm french so before this video i had no idea what margaritaville was, but i just found out that margaritaville cruises exist. Just dropping that here. Can't wait for you're next road trip there 🍸
Next time you guys do this you guys should make a list of local restaurants that haven't really franchised but are still pretty famous nationwide not sure if thats a thing but it sure would be neat.
Save me Hot Luigi™ , save me
28:02 I can't believe the people walk backwards in Orlando.
I went to San Antonio a few years back. Took a ride on one of those riverwalk tour boats. Went to Buckee's for the first time on that same trip. This video brought back some memories
Jimmy split his soul into each location, like horcruxes.  By eating at each location, Eddy destroyed all chances of Jimmy’s world domination.
33:39 bruh thats just a hamburger
Still waiting on the bubba Gump shrimp trip
you guys missed the location in capitola :0
That wholesome street heckler is the real Jimmy
eddy never stop this series
not only the content, but the style of narration and sense of humor is almost exactly like that guy who ate at chipotle for 30 days to see portion sizes, and also ate at sheetz (like buck-ees) for a month
I assume the stage is there because Jimmy himself performs at one margaritaville every night. Just an endless tour of margaritavilles
Man the cost alone must be 2-3000 for hotels, 3-400 for the food, and I can’t even factor in Ted’s fee for looking at eddies feet  Edit: Yea just finished the video and I way underestimated the cost
I donr know why, but for some reason, the most vivid memory I have of this summer is sitting down with a bowl of watermelon and lime, and watching this video. Not my trip to Mexico, or Seattle, or Michigan, but sitting on my bed with the window open, watching this video
Final?   I’d love another long ass road trip watching you eat mid food and slowly regress into insanity
You had the PERFECT description of the Cat in the Hat ride. I’ve been to Islands of Adventure at least over 20 times in my life and I’ve never heard anyone NOT talk about how terrifying that ride is. It’s scarier than Velocicoaster and Hulk combined. I still have nightmares of the cat in the hat grabbing me into the unknown and my sleep paralysis is starting to turn into the shape of a cat.
I ate in the boat booth at the PCB location
I'm sorry that you had to go to Austin TX for this. My condolences. The best part of going to Austin is leaving Austin.
I’m just very confused by the fact that you rented a car for a road trip and chose a pickup truck. Not exactly what I think of when I think road trip vehicle
This again but hard rock cafe
Ive been to the biloxi ones so many times. ITS PEAK
Is it weird to notice that Jimmy Buffett died like 1.5 months after this vid was released?
Is it just me or is this video so good you can just keep watching it over and over again. It’s really quite amazing, thank you eddy and rip JB
Im damn well yalls stomach. Was. Dead. Like tmi but one trip is death to me
Damn Drew's GF is insanely hot wth
You should go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp next
The place around the Pigeon Forge location is pretty great! The Mellow Mushroom Pizza’s food is genuinely pretty good (or at least the bread I had there was, I was a little sick at the time), and some of the shops have pretty interesting things (one of the places has birds that you can take photos with).  The margaritaville is okay.
im about to turn 18 this month, would you recommend a margaritaville as a good place to go for my 21st birthday?
The "graceful" chair sit kills me 😂
Im sorry, Buddy made my day
Being a Syracuse local this gave me whiplash LMAO
7:40 I genuinely don’t understand what “tiny forest” he’s talking about here. I just see an empty net looking crate thing like where’d the luggage go wtf
Wasting away again
Looks like we are a little over due for a part 3.
19:54 I JUST WANNA BE PART OF YOUR SYMPHONYYYY 🐬🌈✨️🐬🌈✨️🐬🌈✨️🐬🌈✨️🐬🌈✨️🐬🌈✨️
Eddy needs to visit every Madame Tussauds in the world in one trip for the next one of these videos
6:26 guys his tummy huwrts:(
margaritaville = jonestown
You totally skipped over margaritaville in sandusky ohio
wwjd. RISE OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTL-
6:16 his tummy hurt :(
48:29 this MIGHT be weezer
THE markiplier recommended this pov so it must be the best
This video killed him eddy
I'm so glad you showed us the THING because I was so curious on my drive from phoenix to texas but I didn't have the time to investigate
my cat loved this video
He had a Grindr date 21:27
I'm sorry but I watched Ted's video first and, as someone who's going into both these mens channels blind:   "Ted finished his video in the room" happening several times while Eddy is exiled off to do fuckall,,,,, Ted is actually just a manwhore sexiling his buddy at each stop methinks
Waiting for the every Bubba Gump Shrimp video
Next ya’ll gotta do medieval times
12:28 the flashbacks 💀
You should do bubba gumps next!!!
Bubba Gumps next?
and this is the story of how eddy became an alcoholic
fake completionist he didn’t get the ripoff margaritaville in sandusky ohio /lh
I have a margaritavill beach towel before I even knew what margaritavill is
Why does this video about a Margaritaville road-trip have the same narrative conflict as the Shining?
11:59 eyyy i know that boat captain
18 years later and i still vividly remember a nightmare i had at 6 where the cat in the hat tried to push me into train rails
14:58 I have to go ! There
As someone who’s never been to rainforest cafe, this video is better because I’ve actually been to the margaritaville in Chicago
32:24. I LOVE this bit but part of me thinks of Jimmy doing like Section 8 housing for the community and imagining a Margaritaville Hood🤣
shame you didn't get that hat
This is the first time in my life that I heard about the Florida keys
i feel like the only natural conclusion WOULD be visiting all of the buccees in the country
Your video is done much better than teds tbh, you actually inform viewers of your experience and like go tos at each place, teds is just  " look we went here now here now here" with little substance
Cool Eddy seems pretty bad ass.
you know you could have ordered the cocktails virgin right eddy
why does every video with danny gonzalez in it makes him look like hes is insane.   also i now meed to go to margaritaville now
Eddy i love you because you can make me laugh by doing absolutely nothing. 52:53
Your name is Deep Eddy?  huh...
i rewatch these road trips videos at least once a month. they are so comforting some how
I was hoping you'd hit the one in oregon :/ darn
Me: well I’m from Florida and the rain isn’t that bad   Eddy: just shut the fuck up  Me: ok😢
I need to see you guys hit every Bubba Gump
do mcdonald's next
"I ate at every McDonnald" when ?
As a NM citizen.. the thing is... 😐😑😐
Turns out jimmy was the friends we made along the way
48:23 this pic goes so insanely hard
11:55 i found this a little too funny
eddy i went to the location/resort in mississippi, does this count as me being in one of your videos
I know this has nothing to do with the video, but I work for a company that sells the pipe on the back of that truck at 49:13, and when I saw it, I had Nam flashbacks to every time I've had to deal with it. It wasn't difficult, I'm just very timid on a forklift and I always had problems with this particular kind of pipe (I believe it's C900 PVC, by the way, it's used primarily for the transport of potable water). We sell all different varieties, C900 was always the one I struggled with the most, and I have no idea why.
The first thing that came to mind when Eddie said they were getting on the road at the beginning of the video was that scene from shrek with donkey singing “on the road again” and shrek regretting his life choices.
R.I.P Jimmy Buffett (1946-2023)
How was it?
Another roadtrip would be epic.. it doesn't have to be so long of a trip. Hard Rock Cafes in the Eastern Hemisphere?
41:32. The F is the F in Buffett from Buffett Live Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays. But it is also totally the Facebook font XD.  As an aside, banger of an album for all you parrotheads out there. My favourite live of his. As much of a banger as this video which makes me wish there was more than 1 Margaritaville up north of the border!
I saw margarita brand frozen entrees at the store yesterday and thought of this video.
You skipped the one  in Shreveport/Bossier.
Fun fact Boom Sauce is actually a pretty standard thing you find places. Usually, it's just one boom in the name, but I'm assuming this one was the same with just an extra boom in the name. Usually, it's mayo, ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic.
Flash bang 4:08
Rich guys with pretty gfs
I want that shirt, PLEASE
I bet that hotel in NY costs $500 a night for a shoebox
Whens the Bubba Gumps road trip?
you really were pulling off that hat, tho
is it just me or is eddy slowly joining a maragaritaville cult in this video
Please I want him to go to every old spaghetti factory in the country
Willms Park
While I watch in my Buc-ee’s blanket…
Why does every single place in United Estates feels so souless??
Hard Rock Cafe next
Woooow that margaritaville that stayed open was sooo nice 😮 🎉
JSCHLATT APPEARANCE?
get a life?
I find it funny how Ted and Eddy never seem to be happy about their trips at the same time.
I’m a little sad you guys didn’t upload a roadtrip video this summer. Would have loved to see a part three and finish out the trilogy. Still love both of your content.
i challenge them to go to every mcdonald’s in the US and Canada
Cant wait for “I went to every Bubba Gumps in the country”
Why do you keep TalkiNG liKE ThISSS?? for no reason
Even worse is there’s a T. there. So binkly liked that so much he just went by his middle name.
It's been a year, I wonder what chain is next?
Pour me something tall and strong This door is to remain unlocked during business hours Don't lock that door - it's why I wrote this song While you're at it try our whisky sours.  -- One of Jimmy's songs, probably
one just opened up in Tahoe. looks like you have to run the challenge again. sorry
I heard Danny Gonzales is a bad boy.
There was a margaritaville in jurassic world which makes sense due to Jimmy Buffet's cameo
Now for Planet Hollywood!
Ted is adorable
Its pronounced beh-LUX-ee, my dude.
Petition to get Eddy and Ted sponsored for "I ate in every Hard Rock Cafe in the World".
Fun fact...i was in that margaritaville casino the night the gaming commission came in and shut it down. Wildest night of my life 😂
That’s so funny cuz I was at them 8 minutes before you
Margaritaville cruise when?
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co
Now you understand my pain
Eddy has rainforest ptsd :((
SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT SCHLATT
Rest in peace JB
We are very proud of your achievement
Bro at the middle I was like jimmy are you high especially the New York part😂
This was Eddy's journey to become an alcoholic cult member
Smart guy. Jimmy Buffet not only talented but a keen business sense.
He didn’t learn his lesson the first time around
Gout speedrun
27:00 “all that stuff is still happening but I’m in Florida and I had a margarita today.” As a Floridian that’s so real
Medieval Times next
i went to the world's largest bucees and spent 3 hours and all of my money there. chicken sandwich which was pretty alright though
It tickles me that ted seemingly gets way less “you killed jimmy” comments cause to me it implies everyone thinks if one of them were to do it it’d definitely be eddy
22:10 I'm from Miami and you met the Brickell Twerker. He's a local celebrity that you guessed it... stands out there and twerks on Brickell Avenue to electronic music. Glad to see you gave him some love. 😊😊😊😊😊
I can't believe you drove right by my house in Giddings, TX where 77 crosses 290 and you didn't even say hi. lol.
I lost it "What if?" and it's just a picture of the twin towers.
You and Ted should go to all 13 Dick’s Last Resort
Syracuse represent!!!
Every McDonald's in the US and Canada next?
every mcdonalds in the cuntry please
In April of this year I drove from San Antonio to LA and “The Thing” billboards became a running joke with my mom lol. Another cool thing is I’m from El Paso, lived in San Antonio, and now live in LA. So I severely enjoyed the beginning of this video 🥰
AS someone who spent most of their life in El Paso, The Thing was formative to my life and I am glad to see it get it's dues.
why did i learn more about north american geography in this more than i did in school
I visited the Margaritaville in NYC and that was one Margaritaville too many.
I added visiting a Margaritaville to my USA travel wish list. It's perfect
Why would anyone do such a thing?
12:22 its being in Texas. Thats the negative part. The fact youre in Texas.  They don’t coddle dolphins on this channel and i appreciate as someone who also has a disdain for those perverted monster creatures
"final time" too many views, it'll happen again
This feels like the ziplining episode of south park
Isn't there one in miami international airport?
Not to be dramatic or anything but I'd die for buddy the dog
i need a kurtis conner and eddy crossover frfr
Everyone needs a “Ted” in their lives. You’ll often think they’re a happy go lucky idiot before realizing they’re preventing you from being a miserable pos 24/7.
bro is wasting away at margarittaville
I rewatched this like 4 times now lol 😎😂
the tim misny at 46:30 killed me
Hello Eddy! I wanted to apologize and issue a retraction of my comment one year ago—I told you that you had missed a Margaritaville in Jacksonville, Florida, but upon recent reflection and inspection I realize that I was wrong: the Jacksonville franchise is a Margaritaville HOTEL with a Landshark Bar & Grill inside. Please forgive me!
Do Lulu’s
Who's watching this in 2020??? RIP Jimmy Neutron 😢
I’m not sure if it existed at the time of filming but there is another margaritaville in Conroe TX
I fully believe that this arc will conclude with them attempting to do every Hard Rock Cafe, ending halfway through when Eddy pitches Teddy off the side of Niagara Falls.
saying "new jersey" right after the person smoking a cigarette on the beach at 41:42 is so authentic.
I grew up with my step dad playing Jimmy Buffett a lot, and this made me so happy and nostalgic ♪⁠ ⁠\⁠(⁠^⁠ω⁠^⁠\⁠ ⁠)
Come on cross country themed restaurant boys! It’s been a year. Do all the bubba gump shrimps or something
Eddy has such 🥺 eyes
This video and the rainforest cafe one is literally my fav videos of all time!! Me and my sister are craving more so u and Ted should ABSOLUTELY do another one of these at like bubba gumps or another funny spot!!!! Thanks for the videos eddy!
"No, we've got Marina Abramovic at home."   Marina Abramovic at home:
Alright so when are you doing every Bubba Gump in the country. Every Hofbrau house would be sick too though.
49:25 one would say you can o-fish-ally. ( credit to my girlfriend)
18:46 i said "good" when eddy said they decided to sit at the bar.
Am I crazy or did you miss  the one in Capitola California? It's not a big one, it feels more like a local bar/restaurant
i don’t love the fact that known racist and ableist schlatt is involved in this video.
Georgia native who laughed knowingly when they got caught in traffic on the way to Atlanta
Playing Vivaldi while talking about Jimmy Buffet's music is disconcerting to say the least...and yet again while at the Times Square Margaritaville, and at the end too? Vivaldi is rolling over in his grave😵‍💫
"Every johnny rockets"
Oh hunny Syracuse 😂😂😂
going from Ted to Eddy's vid with the drastic change of mood, is everything i wanted and more
28:02 THOSE PEOPLE ARE WALKING BACKWARDS!!!!
my biggest flex is that i've eaten at a margaritaville that these guys have not been to. unfortunately, it was in detroit.
I'm fighting not to click off, as this is too much Margaritaville even for me.
God I love these guys lol. Also that sunset with the dolphins was so beautiful 🐬🌅🐬
Litterally dragged my family to Margaritaville in Boston  today because of you
Being a YouTuber is so weird. So much consumerism+very touching human connection.
rest in peace jimmy buffett
Did he not show the Tahoe location in this video?
it's been a year where the next "I ate at every _____" ? chop chop movie boy, More of your despair for our pleasure please
Bubba gump shrimp when
I have the Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville The Cookbook. One of my favorites!
Hey!  This video is talked about in detail in the newest We’re Here To Help!!!   I got so excited when I realized it was you all that cause a small debacle in a marriage with your margaritaville video.    https://youtu.be/BAqnpNjo-W8?si=layJglXqznVlAYab
That moustache is sexy as hell!
So my boyfriend and I are in Atlantic City for a few days, and we had to stop here for dinner just because of your video. We each had a burger and they were good, if overpriced. But it was a fun time, and we did it because ot you; take that however you'd like!
This whole video is pretty gay. Not mad about it
Hey Eddy, this video and the Rainforest Cafe video were both referenced in the latest episode of Jake Johnson’s podcast: We’re Here to Help called “Noah’s Arc”.
Rewatching this was as glorious as the first time 😂 3ed trip when? 😊
11:38 doing the British classic fish and chips wrong 😢
Ted…unfortunately reminds me…of myself…
47:45  Danny is like some weird little elf that just appears out of nowhere and does weird little elf things.
I have a dog named buddy
Who’s here from “We’re here to help”?
Why would you get Fish & Chips and Jambalaya in the MIDWEST?! Da fuq you thinkin'?
Why just why would you rent a truck to cover 9,000 miles? Why not a comfortable sedan!?
That margarita shirt is not it. Good lord
37:24 hey Wisconsin Dells mentioned! Wisconsin Dells did the tourist trap thing first! And better! Where else can you find 20 t-shirt shops that are the exact same?
So i don’t know if this is new or if it was simply missed, but I went to lake tahoe a few weeks ago, and what did i see but a Margaritaville on the Nevada side of the lake. All i could think about was this video
Rip jimmy
9:28 teds little "wOAH BUDDY" was adorable
There used to be one in Sausalito, California.  Really nice location too on the waterfront with views of San Francisco Bay.  Currently a place called Salito's Crab House.
Ted getting a "The Thing" shirt is hilarious
Ted Nivison.
Did they go to the one in Boston?
These videos are the only things tethering me to this earth
Belvidere Oasis spotted
Yall missed the margaritaville on lake conroe texas
5:41 ooo smoked shrimp
What’s the road trip this year?
Have to go to the Boston one now
Just wanted to let you know that there are also Margaritaville cruises!!! They look awful, you should try them!
as a resident of Tulsa i'm so sorry lmao but i'm glad the food was okay
WHAT ABOUT SHREVEPORTTTT LOUISIANAAA!!! ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
Ok now you guys have to go to every Chuck E. Cheese or something
This is like- the third time I've come back tot his video. It's just pure modern art. I hope people come back to this twenty years later for the Gen Z/Millennial culture class.
Eddy, ill have you know you and Ted are the only YouTubers my 50 year old mother actually keeps up with and listened to the podcasts of-so do with that info what you will
How is your liver doing after this trip?
34:15 Wasn't expecting a stretch of freeway to be named after golfer Bobby Jones (who was born and died in Atlanta) but here we are.
im so disappointed to find that the syracuse location (the one closest to me) was the worst one
As a texas resident i would confirm that big ole puddles are very common here
I dont know why it took me so long to watch this but I love these crazy videos you make. Though I have to say, I am glad that you didnt have the same level of car troubles this time like you did for the Rainforest Cafe Series  Hope to see some more crazy ideas like these in the near future!
Oh my God I love being American
The biggest takeaway from this was to live like Buffet lived
I watched teds video a couple days ago and even but though its the same vido basiclly you guys deliver it in such diffrent and funny way ways that its worth watching both of them
He ate all of Jimmy’s horcruxes
This video single-handedly killed Jimmy Buffet
Next year you have to do hard rock cafe
Why not the one in Puerto Rico
i was gonna say yall skipped pensacola buuuuut its no longer a margaritaville 💀
missed the one in the Ft. Lauderdale Airport
Foot kink blue balls 😢
Im indonesian, have ZERO idea what a margaritaville is, and probably only heard of it because i was a familt vlogs trip around florida and they went to eat there, and will i invest my free time in watching a 58 minute long video of a man getting flashbacks to his beloathed enemy “the rainforest cafe” despite me only have seen one in japan in the disney resort mall-thing? Yes.
how did you encapsulate the spirit of a cult so perfectly in a margaritaville video..
This is one of those films where I wish I could watch this for the first time again. Such a good video Edit: Im so high for some reason I thought this was the rainforest cafe video, and I actually can’t recall a lot of this video lol. so ig its like my first
No sponge cake..?
Have a great day
Congrats on not getting stabbed or shot in destiny USA in Syracuse there are certain floors that are just too scary to go to for fear of being followed. But hey glad Syracuse got a mention 🙌
Next one should be Hard Rock Cafes!
We need a sequel 😭
It's about that time of year again. I wonder where Eddy's been...
this video is so nostalgic… reminds me of simpler times
Now go on the Margaritaville cruise ships.
Awesome. Now drink one beer with a pizza at every Chuck E Cheese in the country.
What if they took on Cheesecake Factory?
"I have ears like a dog so-" "I think it might be tinnitus." EDDY 😭😭😭
I went on a school trip and we stayed at the margaritativle hotel in Mississippi, but they didn’t let us do any of the cool stuff except the arcade and I’m still mad
rainforest cafe came out on june 30th  margaritaville came out on july 20th  WHAT will we be getting on august 10th???  i’ve cracked the prophecy
I'll consider Eddy the GOAT once he successfully eats at every Chili's in the country. And Canada.
There are 22 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants in the US waiting for you to try
Lame. 2 people with the same vlog. Boring
A 24 day long trip of Ted slowly siphoning the life force out of Eddy
Always good to see Eddy and Teddy Burback having a fun time 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣
2 hours of my life spent watching both Ted and Eddy's video on margaritaville. Worth it.  Edit: holy shit both of them got sponsored by Sofi. That's funny af.
These videos teach me that the US has some really weird attractions— the giant bean, the huge pistachio, the huge gas station??? THE THING???
Once again Canada wins.
Can you visit every Buc-ee’s? Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you in advance.
Is city wok a real thing in the US then, I thought it was just a South Park thing lol
Please do a trilogy!!
All hail Bucc-ee’s
“Deep Eddy” Burback
The food is expensive and sucks
Like this for every Hard Rock Cafe they should go to
Just want to say i traveled from Chile to New York for the first time last june and with my sister we went to Margarita Ville on Time Square and it felt surreal to be in the same place as this video... also the service was awful, the food was good though
If only you waited a year to do this video, then I could’ve seen my city in this video… alas, twas not to be
hi i actchuly work at River Spirit Casino. a quick correction. that they don't own the building well... they kinda own half of it. the other half is own the creek nation. i am surprised you said their food quality was good. thou I never get the chance to get behind their kitchen I did try their food once and it was fine.
you guys should go to every hard rock
Count how many times Stephen A Smith makes a cameo on the tvs
Why are you locked in the bathroom?
This is the guy that turned his back on a friend like a very very spineless man. Nice mustache tho
i wonder which theme restaurant chain will be next? what new road trip lies in store for poor eddy
And literally a month after this they opened one in San Diego
I like that you for the most part seemed to be having an actual good time compared to rainforest cafe.  Probably because there was a lot more sincere effort in the Margaritaville locations to live up to Jimmy Buffet's vibes and resort style bona fides.  And the only thing that weighed you down was having maybe too many sweet Margaritas.
I just looked this up. Jimmy Buffet died in September of that year. I wonder if he saw the video. ....pretty sure he would have gotten a kick out of it.
Now do every mcdonalds in the world
Oh you encountered prime and primal I heard they came out of a margaritaville to😂
You should go to every Bucee’s in the country
I just walked by the Syracuse Margaritaville today and it was as dead as it was in this video
You skipped Shreveport liar
RIP Jimmy Buffet you woulda loved Margaritaville
Doofus
Please do medieval times next
You're not a true Texan if you can't easily navigate a buckees at 7am after pulling an all nighter
💯
wtf how was this a year ago, I could’ve sworn this video was only a few months old 😭
Isn't there a margaritaville in Shreveport?
Today marks the 1 year anniversary of this video 🎉
Honestly, not having a version on Patreon to plug where your feet are unpixelated is such a missed opportunity for a joke and incredible chance to plug a patreon ever, lmao
Hard rock! 🎸
Eat at every McDonald’s in the us and Canada
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe
eddy it's time for you to go to every chuckecheese
Growing up in NYC, anytime someone asks me where to visit for their first time in the city, I tell them Times Square is is a place you only need to see in passing on the subway lol. I hate Times Square
I had the pleasure of going to the Margaritaville in biloxi, one time in 2023, and the other one this year. twas a blast going there both times, tho it was only for the arcade which still is the best part of biloxi for me.
It’s almost been a year since this video guys if he did it again what would it be 😭
you should go to every single Bubba Gump in the US and globally. Lmao they have 22 in the US, 3 in Japan, 2 in Mexico, 2 in Malaysia, and 1 in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. Seems like a great time
What about the Jimmy Buffet restaurant on the Jimmy Buffet cruise that goes to the Bahamas?
watching this in the atlanta location IN THE SAME SPOT!!!
Before the Cincinnati Margaritaville was bulldozed to make way for a highway interchange, I ate a grilled, blackened fish sandwich there that was the best fish sandwich I’d eaten anywhere, ever. So, of course, it appears it wasn’t on the menu at any Margaritaville you visited. But then, that was like a decade ago too, back before COVID sucked the soul and quality out of restaurants nationwide. Thanks for jarring my memory!
What’s this years thing
His reasoning for why it’s not a cult it exactly what a member of a cult would say
“The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhoea”
Hoping for a another challenge this year!!
This and the Rainforest Cafe video are absolute YouTube classics 👍
If fatty foods are causing you gastric complications, you may want to go to a  doctor and get your gall bladder checked.
I am a "Ted did it" truther
I remember there being a Margaritaville in Oahu when I was stationed there, but apparently it changed hands, would have loved to see the logistics of having to go to Hawaii just for this video.
City Wok is real?!
Bro was it good bro I haven't been yet
9:03 the aliens are caked up 😂 why do we always give aliens either et bodies or Pixar mom booties
There a Margaritaville in Palm Springs. Lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcmBALxDkRY  Have this for the dinosaur alien section
Nice! Destin rules!
You should eat at every Rock & Brews. Founded by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley from Kiss. Just 17 locations
Calling an attraction The Thing? is genius marketing
Tulsa Oklahomas River spirit is not owned by margarita ville it’s owned by the Muskogee Creek Nation tribe
I didnt even know this was a restaurant i thought this was a magarita machine from southpark lmfao
What's next every Arby's
I don't get the existential crisis bit for doing this project. Most of us just went to our regular day jobs while you were doing this. 😂
Now you have to go on the Margaritaville at Sea cruise ships.
The content I signed up to see
Eddie I know you’ve had a million suggestions but please do Medieval Times next.
Now do their cruise ships
He is the hero. We didn’t know we needed.
I’ve never been to Margaritaville and I’m an hour away from one
A lot of people would KILL to have da time and resources to do meaningless shit like dis. I enjoyed dis video truly lmao.
Manifesting a third instalment
I almost died in the lawn chairs outside Margaritaville in Orlando last month
Rip the late and great jimmy buffet
Literally my twin's fantasy
Bubba cup shrimp locations next 🙏 Tom hanks hijinx ensue!
No hate but why are Eddy’s eyes so big
I think actually with that moustache you are a deed ringer for Inspector Jacques Clouseau all you need is Cato.
As someone who has road-tripped from California to El Paso every summer for the past 4 years, thank you for stopping at The Thing? and showing us so that I can stop wondering what that’s all about every time I pass by it
you don't are drunk driving?
SAN ANTONIO MENTIONED
Go to every single bubba gump shrimp location in the us. There are 23.
I would have sued that museum for not actually showing anything about the 1982 movie The Thing (and don't tell me that museum actually exists since 1965 at that location!)
Y’know, these trips makes me aware that I’m more like Ted than Eddie. I can eat the same thing for every meal for a month and not get tired (legit, my childhood had weird phases and most were breakfast foods?) and I genuinely think I’d enjoy myself on a journey like this. I might even be worse than Ted because I would order the same exact thing every time
Hey Eddy, hope this message finds you well. I recently had an idea that I just scrapped seconds ago after typing this sentence. Idea number two, Dave and Busters Grand Prizes. Eddy, you, and Ted, venture to as many Dave and Busters you can get to, set a time limit of gaming, perhaps a budget, final judging of prizes and crowning "The Most Profitable Arcade Gamer Of All Time Between Eddy and Ted Only" prize.
What about the cruise?
"Do not go in spencers" What, you don't like the dildos and bongs on full display next to the anime graphic tees?
calling the margarita "okay" is what killed Jimmy Buffett
I told my mom I wanted to go to the San Antonio riverwalk and she informed me that I had been there. Because apparently I almost fell in that river when I was 3 because I was running around.
If this ever becomes an annual series, hard rock cafe should be done next
Go to every Medieval Times!! Must complete the trilogy
Ts actually makes me feel better
i love rewatching eddys videos because you can tell through and through how passionate he is about his work, like the cinematography is so good!!!
Woah woah woah. You didnt add the santa cruz one buster
So year 3 Cheesecake Factory?
Eddy I'm sure you'll be ecstatic to learn that there is a Margaritaville CRUISE. Just so thats ruminating in your brain now for future content.
I VOTE BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT
Now you guys need to go to every Bubba Gump restaurant in the country and take the Forrest Gump quiz every single time!
'please state the intent of your visit' - 'Margaritaville'
Now eat on every McDonalds in the planet.
Imagine 3000 years in the future, alien archeologists find this video, and use it as reference for a typical human culture. And alien scholars teach this in their universities, with textbooks describing human eating culture as nomadic fried food peregrination, then hypothesizing about our high metabolic need to be eating multiple times a day on a heavily themed eateries.
Its weird that Julien Solomita changed his name, but i love his new content!
Theres a Margheritaville in Mississippi!?  Holy shit, Eddy Burbach was in my state
Cool video. I'm starting to think that Margaritaville would do great in Australia.
Let’s go minnesota brings the best out
Eddie you guys missed the Margaritaville ship so surely this trip is not complete.
The rewatchability of this video is insane, i must have watched it at least 12 times already
Go to every yellow deli next
This video is fire!
I’m calling it now, bubba gump shrimp is next.
i like that the Jimmy Buffet book clearly said Fiction on the back
A man's slow descent into madness. I love it 😂
For the last 25 years of his life at least, Jimmy Buffet didn't eat sugar or carbs and didn't drink except for the very occasional tequila with water on the rocks. He was kind of a health nut so the fact you did this to yourself wasn't very "Jimmy" like at all. Hilarious though! RIP Jimmy, you were one smart business man. Fins UP! 🤣
drum corps community 🤝 eddy burback having complex memories associated with the san antonio riverwalk
Coming up on 12 months. What will you do you two? Eat at the
He sacrificed his tummy aches for us
braden the stalker
I’m so intrigued by this. Such a silly thing to do, but you got to see all of America.
Every Applebees
I just watched the rainforest cafe. I didn't think you'd do it again and here we are.
I wasn't able to get the margaritaville shirt in time and it fills me with depression to this day
How the fuck are all these meals like 2000 kcals?
It's been almost a year, what restaurant are they gonna tour now???
go on the margaritaville cruise pls
It never fails to make me laugh when I watch this man’s reaction to Bucee’s. More people need to know about this lmao. As a Texan, it’s a part of life here and it blows my mind that people have never heard of it.
Hi! Dolphin here, I didn’t see your feet. I don’t owe you anything.
The way this video has over 5 times the amount of views the actual margaritaville song has
I know I'm a year late, but you should consider going to every Bubba Gump restaurant
My parents wept when Jimmy died.
Now you gotta do Bubba Gump. Just to be tortured by the MOA again.
Ted isa gd trooper. I hope everyone has the oppertunoty to know and be a Ted. Love Ted
Wonder if they will do this again and with what restaurant? Mid evil times? Hard Rock Cafe?
Don't tell these guys about hard rock cafe
nathan is basically the wizard from inscryption
Now do every McDonald's next
Imaging being perpetually hungover for like a month, and being able to make a money and a youtube video off that. Congratulations to you bro.
Had to film a last minute video aka met a girl on the trip 🤪
Eddie's Nam Flashback is the San Antonio Rainforest Cafe
me when he misses a margaritaville resort in the ozarks 😭😭😭😭
Eddy and Ted should go to every Bubba Gump so that when they go back to Mall of America they can get PTSD from both Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville
Visits every McDonald’s next!
I use to live in Key West for like 5 years - and I never ate at Margaritaville. Now I kinda regret it.
did you know there are only 22 Bubba Gump Shrimp Companies in the US of A
This is my voice 1 month on Margaritaville
PCB margaritaville is garbage af
secret is not better than degree, I DID A TEST AND IT LASTED ME 3 DAYS IN THE BURNING HOT
1:52 and I needed to stop the video to go listen to the absolute banger that is The Four Season by composer Antonio Vivaldi.
you guys should do every great wolf lodge next :)
Weird seeing such a popular video feature Panama City
They are building another margaritaville
You could’ve gone to every Texas Roadhouse in the country
Hey friend, it’s pronounced Bil-uh-xi. Love your review on our massive margaritaville. 😂
It’s almost time. Just two more months. I vote for Cheesecake Factory
who the hell is jimmy buffet
what about the one off lake conroe north of Houston, Texas.
2024... Every Single Bubba Gump!!!!!
You skipped Puerto Rico
Now we need Hard Rock Cafe
RIP Jimmy Buffett
We need Hard Rock Cafe next!!
It would be sort of selfish to want Eddy and Ted to endure more of these long trips for the entertainment or totally happy memories, but going back to the rainforest cafe during every final stop would be a great tradition
Why didn’t you guys go to the Margaritavillie in the Lake of the Ozarks Missouri? It’s been open since 2019
You should go to every Medieval Times
The crazy thing is that I recently started watching you and I love your content. Last year in July I went on a trip to pigeon forge and we went to the island which is where that margaritaville is. I went on the Farris wheel too specifically the day you posted this which tells me you rode it before July 20th. I potentially sat in the same ferris wheel cart as Eddy burback
this video killed jimmy buffett
Bro it's not the food it's drinking every single night
i mean if you really want to make your tummy hurt try going to every mcdonalds in the us
Aw man I didn’t know you were from the Chicago suburbs too! Was super weird to see that old overpass in a video, I remember specifically getting a geico gecko plush in one of their claw machines as a kid. such a weirdly iconic part of the area around Chicago lmao
I think nearly every time I've watched this I've been drunk.
You guys didnt go to the margaritaville in Boston??
I can’t get over Danny’s antics here  47:45 . Wtf and why’s he so funny
Made my mom watch this in the room at the resort in Oregon because it felt necessary for us to be able to stay here.
Imagine spending Times square rent money for a CBD store? Even a "boutique".
Oh city walk, not shitty Wok. My bad, I know that from South park.
I learned to gamble at Margaritaville in Vegas.  It was a really great time!  Super friendly staff and cheap tables!  Or maybe all the free margaritas made it feel that way...
It was you. You killed him
only a couple months away from the annual Ted and Eddy obscure north american chain restaurant roadtrip, and im so excited
It’s crazy a month after this video jimmy buffet died 😕
Hey Eddy, the Boston location is open now. You and Ted should fly there for completion’s sake lol
I think a better name for this video would be "eddy becomes delusionally attached to jimmy buffet and discovers alcoholism".
Start a petition for them to go to every Red Robin
yo if you and Ted come back to Minnesota for another video hit me up i live in the Twin Cities added im subbed to both you and Ted
12:10   "Mom I frew up on billy."
I wonder if he can write off the bills on his taxes
wonder what this year's road trip will be~
46:31 MISNEY ITS HIM OMG
RIP jimmy buffet
Can't wait for his trip this year!
Not as many, but would be fun to see them do a medieval times trip. I think there are 10.
The way you just make these videos have a weird cult/religion vibe and that your getting brainwashed by it 😂
Now you gotta go to every Bubba Gump in America 👍
hey eddy it's almost time, when's the "i ate at every hard rock cafe/any other chain in the country (and canada)" coming
It is in fact, five o' clock
in the future you should not give background information over vivaldi playing the background. i was bopping too hard to pay attention and now i can  barely type
As a British person that fish and chips offends me.
Oops i did get the Jambalaya. It wasn't exceptional, but nothing bad happened
One of your friends looks a lot like NakeyJakey, you should tell him
It’s almost been a year, I am eagerly awaiting the next road trip
You have two months.. two left until its time
As someone who has never heard of Jimmy Buffet, and the only American “Buffet” I’m aware of is “warren”, it was startling to say the least to hear there was a restaurant chain named after him 😅 glad I watched hahah
47:24 I used to work at Navy Pier and the reason that Margaritaville looks like a Chicago tavern is that it used to be one, it was called Charlie’s Ale House. I used to get a really tasty mac and cheese dish there. They barely renovated to turn it into Margaritaville.
17:22 When I just can't get my kid to shut up
Hard Rock Cafe next? Thoughts?👀 Gotta complete the trilogy
This is my first time hearing about margaritaville. An hour into this video and I still don't know what it is. Margarita doesn't sound like a real word anymore.
NOOOO I WANTED TO SEE TOES 19:38
Eddy genuinely developing PTSD over Rainforest Cafe will never not be funny
So we’re not gonna talk about how Ted kept getting separate rooms so he could film feet vids 😂😂😂😂
Next road trip: going to every bucee’s in America??????
Eddy, I'm from Florida, and the rain there IS a big deal. Can't tell you how many times I had to drive through rain so thick, I could barely see 10 feet in front of my car. Not even counting the times I was driving over a bridge during waterspout and tornado warnings. It's crazy.  It does make the rain in SoCal feel like tiny baby bitch rain, and I do laugh at California drivers who suddenly forget how to drive at all in what equates to me as a drizzle, but I've earned that.
No one's talking about the bizarre alien and dinosaur museum.
Is noone going to tell them about the locations they missed?
What about Puerto Rico?
I am excited to see how their trip to see every medieval times in US and Canada turns out.
That alien museum is dope as hell
rewatching this a year later and realizing you skipped the Jacksonville location. looks like you’ll have to redo the trip sorry ed
ok now do hard rock cafe
Eddy saying my tummy hurts reminds me of the “mommy I frew up” meme
I love you deep eddie
Here's a challenge: Eat at every Texas Roadhouse in the US
What so weird is that I've been to the Margaritaville in Mississippi hundreds of times and I have never experienced any of the stuff y'all saw 💀
Okay do Applebee's next
Dino war? Was that before or after WW2?
Well, I ate at every Piña Coladaburg. What do I get?
I can’t believe Jimmy died 2 months after this 😅
well, now you have gone to at least 1 Margaritaville that is no longer alive :( Vegas is gone.
Please do a Bubba gump shrimp co. road trip next!
2024 Eddy and Ted go to Dollywood?
Seeing you on the Atlantic City beach made me lol
Every single hard rock, cmon, let’s do it.
Hi Eddy and Ted, I just tried margaritaville for the first time 2 days ago and wanted to give commend you guys for eating only margaritaville for 3 weeks too long. Margaritaville was the worst food i ever had for wayy too much and had no flavor. Its not your fault Jimmy. RIP🙏❤️
As a Southh Carolinian I am grateful the margaritaville was acknowledged but disappointed Broadway at the beach wasn’t explored bc of its strangeness
Dont forget the margaritaville resort casino in Shreveport 😀
Hard rock cafe road trip when?
This and Ted's video are somehow the greatest unexpected tribute to Jimmy ever made.
52:45 “hello Eddy… you look tired… I can fix that”
Now to eat at every Bubba Gump location.
Today, I dine at Margaritaville for the first time ever, in your honor of course. In Times Square, not the best one I guess, but heh
I like how nobody is talking about how Ted was wearing a The Thing shirt towards the end of the video. Not the movie, that random place they went to in Texas.
I have a distinct memory of Margaritaville. My family and I were regulars at the Universal CityWalk Orlando Margaritaville. One time when we went there, after we finished our food, the waiter came with a spread of mousse parfaits. Our parents let me and my 2 sisters take one. What we weren't aware of was that the parfaits were $15 a piece, which caused the check to go over $100, and we felt super guilty. Good times.
But what about Margaritaville at Sea
the parallel between the stages of becoming an alcoholic and the progression of each margarita ville visted is uncanny
“everytime i wanted to go home i took a sip of a margarita” eddy i think thats just called resorting to alcoholism
Yall should do Buc-ee's
5:32 Jimmy was not in fact  watching...
22:14 Average Floridaman encounter
Next year can you please do every Bubba Gump Shrimp?
Next time you do this trip do it in a bmw m4 or a newish porsche or something fun and fast like that. I feel like it would make the trip 1000 times more fun as opposed to the trucks you’ve been using now…
39:22  i rode this in may 2022 when i went on my fifth grade field trip to the island and my bsf and our other partner were there and i thought it went around once BUT IT DID LIKE 3-5 TIMESS im not usually scared of hights but it was so fricken scary and not to mention we got stuck at the top that many times so the people at the bottom could get out 😭😭
So when is Eddy and Ted going to every Bubba Gump in the country? Then they’ll have the “kitschy mall restaurant” trifecta.
Do Long John Silver's next
I want enough money to go on dumb trip. Work and sleep for eternity for me I guess
I can't believe I'll never get to see him live again 😢😢  Oh, also RIP Margaritaville Las Vegas
i went to the thing in the early 2000s and there was zero mention of aliens. i feel ripped off
Ted got Stockholm syndrome
Boomer music of the worst kind.
48:23 wow, my favorite Weezer album.
oh shut up you loved it
They just announced a Margaritaville at Sea cruise. I think we all know what must be done.
I live in Frederick MD. We had a restaurant named Cheeseburgers In Paradise. Jimmy Buffet sued the shit out of them over the name and now it’s called “Beef N Buns in Paradise (what’s in a name)”. 😂😂😂😂
Your gf is so beautiful I couldn't leave her for 24 days. For your content you have very little subs, but that's expected since you don't make 10 seconds shit videos for dumb people.
now the song margeritaville ....is about being miserable ...so lol you did it man
Toes blocked for those beta boys  #saltlife
My Mom is a massive Parrothead who has been to multiple Jimmy Buffet concerts in her lifetime.  I've had a decent portion of Jimmy Buffet's songs memorized since I was 12. I have eaten at three Margaritaville resturaunts, stayed at a Margaritaville hotel, and recently went on a Margaritaville-themed cruise ship. I have worn multiple Margaritaville shirts to school. The family minivan has a "Pirate Looks at Forty" lisence plate on the front. The bar in our basement has two Margaritaville drink coolers, a Margaritaville clock on the wall, a "Changes in Lattitues" sign, and an "It's 5-o'clock Somewhere" sign right above it, and multiple Margaritaville margarita blenders. Our dog has a Land Shark branded life jacket. I own a Margaritaville bike with a little squeaky parrot instead of a bell or horn. I have read four of Jimmy Buffet's books, including two childrens picture books and two short story collections inspired by his songs. My mother's ringtone has been "Margaritaville" the song since she got her first iPhone and I've been conditioned to think her phone is ringing every time I hear that song in the wild. She also wants to move to Florida and live at the Margaritaville Resort outside of Orlando, and wants her gravestone to be a palm tree with lyrics from "The Weather is Here" engraved on it. I also know way too much Jimmy Buffett trivia for someone my age, including his birthday and the stories behind some of his songs.  Did I mention I'm not even of drinking age?  As someone who's been surrounded by Jimmy Buffet shit my whole life, it is utterly fascinating seeing the opinion of an outsider. Yes, the Parrotheads are a cult, even as an insider I can tell you that, but if I had to be born into a cult, I'm glad it was this one.  RIP Jimmy Buffett. You made my childhood, for better or for worse
Eddie, as always me one who has the time to occasionally go to Pigeon Forge for pleasure and understands your propensity for doing documentaries of odd tourist destinations… spend more time near Dollywood. There’s a lot of content to be had there, including the boot places that are buy one, get two free… the business model is bizarre.
I just found out that there is a margaritaville cruise ship!?! Maybe you should go on it as a sequel to this video😂
If you’re a Mbmbam fan, the margaritaville at 33:30 is likely the one where Justin had wait 2 hours for a seat and went to Joe’s Crab Shack instead
Anyone else find it offense that someone would even suggest that aliens destroyed the twin towers?! I have friends from New York that moved out of state after 9/11 bc well...we all know why it happened.
My bro Eddy has a nice life. Pretty girlfriend, good looks and gets to drink daily. Based.
After living in Florida all my life mans really just saw a nice beach sunset without a ton of people everywhere and just found the vibes. Its one of the better feelings to just let the ocean air hit u and forget all the crap going on around u. May not fix things but sometimes people just need a break to relax and feel the breeze
What about the volleyball weekend cruise? Huh Eddie?
Capitola California !
LMAO... so glad you owned that kid at "Stinky Feet", what a poser
i like Jimmy Buffett, always have, but Margaritaville sucks. and the cruise ship is literally the worst in the world (you can see that on youtube).  note: Jimmy was also one of very few billionaire musicians, and about 90% of those billions came from ventures like Margaritaville and various other investment ventures.  for a beach bum, Mr. Buffett sure had his fingers in a lot of pies. he invested in something like 40 different ventures during his life, starting in the 1970s.   he even tried to get something going with Warren Buffett, which they both found funny for obvious reasons (their last names), but ultimately no deal happened.  my guess is Margaritaville was funded by parrothead boomers, and it'll close within 10-15 years, probably to be reopened under a very similar name with very similar mediocre food and drinks.
tequila bottle is my favorite fnaf animatronic
Missed the one in Oregon and the cruise… Doesn’t count, gotta do it again
"The Thing" wasn't always aliens riding dinos. Apparently at one point it was just some dead guy, probably a miner
kafka's theme playing on that opening bit is peak
what a cool dude
I keep coming back to this video and and the Rainforest Cafe PTSD always gets me
you can't just say "I am not going to listen to a man named Binkley" and immediately go to "so we met up with our friend Schlat"
They should go to every red lobster
After watching the rainforest video and this I can confirm Ted is just like me for real with the unstoppable enthusiasm and insistence that my Toyota is better than any other car
Except your quest isn’t done. You didn’t go on the MargaritaVille Cruise
I find it VERY suspicious that Jimmy died two weeks after this video was released
ironically enough,, i also lost my best friend in a buccees once
5:24 oh javis nooo
8:58 Why is that alien so thicc?
“You’re all good pal, have a margarita.”
I’ve never heard of Margaritaville but I’m going to watch this video anyway
- 9/11 mention  - boys immediately encounter Schlatt  What did Eddy mean by this??
17:44 I thought that sign said "the unluckiest fish in the world" which would be a really funny quote for a fish restaurant
Pointing out DollyWood, another cool road trip project would be to cover all the “small” amusement parks. Carowinds NC is another one, they used to have a Scooby doo park but unfortunately it’s been redesigned.
The jumanji like music for the rain forest café ptsd zone outs kill me everytime 😂
You should go to every Trump Tower and you know… see what happens a month later
You gotta do this whole thing over again. Boston just opened a new one
I went to a Margaritaville in I think it was Cozumel Mexico and it was definitely an experience for my 8 year old self
i cant believe this is how jimmy buffet died
Not Hawaii, what about my bros in Hawaii
do hard rock cafe next
Now do Buccees
he does the kubrick stare really well
i'd really like to do this sometimes :)
Jimmys dead eddy… jimmys dead
Not me discovering Eddy, falling in love and then realizing I get 1 video every 3 months 🤬 Worth it but not fair 😭
Imagine adding Starbucks to the list (too many to count, but still).
I’m waiting on the “I ate at every Hard Rock Café/Planet Hollywood in the country” video to drop….👀
"Wisconsin Dells: The Las Vegas strip for Midwest tourists." Nailed it!
Came back to this video, it's funny cause I watched this like a week after coming back from Destin and low and behold my whole vacation group is standing outside and you sat next to the table we just got up from lol the big table with all the drinks and stuff on it
Al the hard rock cafes next?
as someone who has been to the LA margaritaville, yeah no one performs on the stage it’s just kind of there
good, now go to every great wolf lodge in north america
That tax write off must’ve felt great. 😂
Hey nakeyy jakeyy i see you
missed one in Buford GA
i find it funny how this is supposed to be a role reversal of the last trip, where eddy is the one having a good time, but by the end he realizes that this lifestyle is unhealthy and that he shouldnt spend his life chasing it. meanwhile there was no moral to Ted's obsession with RFC, he's just insane
Who the hell is Jimmy Buffett?
46:31 EVERYONE GIVE IT UP FOR MISNY!!!!!
Loved the video guys! Wasn't a big fan of when you showed Jimmy tied up in your truck tho :/
your review killed jimmy
As someone who works at Universal Orlando, I enjoy his experience of cat in the hat
7:27  American problems
It makes vomplete sense that the best Margaritavilles are in Florida 😂
WISCONSIN DELLS MENTIONED‼️
still WRONG
So when are they doing every Hard Rock?
why did they rent a truck for a road trip
There’s also a Margaritaville in San Diego, CA lol
I can’t believe the comments are how I find out jimmy died…
You did not stay at the south padre island location! Fraud
Next year it'll be every Bubba Gump shrimp restaurant.
52:26  If you survive a road trip with a friend, you're true friends 😂
Rip Jimmy
0:56 1:00 was*
The fact he died just a few weeks later feels a little to convenient....
i had my 21st bday at the margaritaville in san antonio and it was ruined by my husbands family. good times.
*Doesn't listen to Binkley*  *Is friends with Schlat*  Hypocritical much?
Wtf is a Margaritaville
This is my comfort video
TULSA REPRESENT‼️
Dude I built the transformers at 43:43
Jimmy Buffet in the spirit realm like "You get it, You really get it. The song is WASTING AWAY IN MARGARITA VILLE. You understand what I meant".
Will you go interview the guys on Podcast the Ride? They’re my favorite podcast guys and I feel your interests are aligned. They’re awesome guys. 😊
30:02 Any hash
Alright I liked this Eddy guy but that part where he was descending into homicidal fantasies made me like and subscribe finally
😂😂😂
Margaritaville Hollywood beach is where I metal detect all the time!
I hope their chain management really watches this... takes notes... and makes changes.
No thanks, I’ll stick with Casa Bonita
46:32 MISNEY SPOTTED
You should go to every McDonald’s location
You should also add up how much you spent at each location
I didn’t even know there was a margarita ville in San Antonio, and I’ve lived here my whole life
So Disney Orlando has a rainforest cafe, and Universal Orlando has a Margaritaville... The mall of america has them facing each other... Theyre a few steps down the river walk in San Antonio... Las Vegas... And both in Niagara falls... The duality continues.
They should do every buba hump’s in the United States and Canada
this is my idea of a living HELL
8:15 “We have it” -McDonald’s
The absolute shock when I realized the beach they visited at key west is exactly where I took senior pictures
Dude, I'M, tired of margaritaville
Can you please do every six flags in America
Next years trip is????
Missed the one in Ozark, MO
You gave away The Thing? You suuuuuuuckkkkk! 😢
Can u do every medieval times dinner n tournament?
I love how these videos show how the US is an empty country with no culture. Just plastic and fake wood and endless bright advertisements. It looks like hell on earth to me.
You skipped Sandusky
So many cameos 😂
Why did they rent a Toyota truck for 24 days of driving lol? I love those trucks but they could have rented something more comfortable and they wouldn’t have had to leave their valuables in the open under a tarp haha.
the worst food ever
i hate to point this out but whatever you ate off of that salad in Cleveland… it wasn’t chicken 😬
Tales From Margaritaville audio book when?
eddy look like hipster mario♥🧡💛💚💙💜
This was awesome
Rumor has it that they replaced Ted with a clone of him still trapped in Buckys to this day
Can’t wait for the Bubba Gump 2024 tour
THIS is a monumental documentation of history.
I love how he clarifies that he’s payed his checks 😂
I can't wait for them to do it a third time
Can't believe jummy buffett passed away, it must be the worse thing that has happened to the us in the month of september
Did you stay at the resort in the Ozarks? They changed the TanTara there into a Margaritaville. I will never not call it Tantara.
There’s a margaritaville in Puerto Rico ….
58:00 LMAOOOOOOO
9:35 THAT IS WILD!!!!!
What a creepy post-capitalism road trip. Every location was nearly empty. Also I think it’s a requirement for a YouTuber to show them camping in the passing lane when they’re on a road trip.
Wait till he finds out that there is a new Margaritaville location in Gaslamp San Diego
got a severe stomach ache while watching this so it felt like an immersive experience
Good video🙌🏻
Only three months until the next franchise road trip 🤭🤭☺️
I don't know if it's just because I'm English, but why the fuck is there a Chicken on the street in LA?!?!?!
LMAO yeah, all of us Floridians do say that about the rain
Every bubba Gump shrimp in the USA
The Thing has gotten a lot less crap since I was a kid. Used to be mostly in a series of horse stables with no real unifying concept. I remember they had one of Hitler's cars and also a life size diorama of a medieval torture chamber but they were completely covered in brown dust because they were out in a barn.
The best of America. So beautiful.
10:46 this is just like The Heartbreak Kid lol
I work at a waterpark by Margaritaville Orlando😭😭😭 I wish I would’ve been a fan at the time you were there😔
Jimmy Buffet seems like a supreme overlord and I’m surprised I’ve never heard of him before
Are American malls usually this empty? Because all the malls they went to in this video seemed eerily desolate. I’d expected the biggest mall in the whole country to be a bit livelier. Even when I go to the mall in the middle of the week in New Zealand they seem busier than this. And when you go on the weekend or in the evening after work, they are jam packed.
this is what living in San Diego is like
I wonder how much all this cost
Bucees have started howing up here in KC  The beaver's influence spreads
What about the new Boston Margaritaville??
the day you decide you don't wanna live anymore, do every McDonald's in the US :P
I went on the Cat in the Hat ride when I was like 12 and my brother made fun of me for being scared
FAKE. …You didn’t go on the Margaritaville cruise 🤷🏻‍♀️
Timestamp for the Hollywood, FL one?
Somehow, cocktail and road trip doesn't add up...
Nobody wants to see YOUR feet!
this is something that you should be proud to tell you children about someday...
I think you should go to every Golden Corral next
We don't have Bucky's in CO, but the mascot looks suspiciously like something that would be left over after an apocalypse. Like just a lone Bucky's sign tilting down across a desolate highway...
now you have to do every medieval times restaurant
Wait till you hear about the margaritaville cruise ship
dude id be careful, at the first stop theres this guy 5:01 in a blue jumper, and i belierve he was in perfect view of your womans cleavage. (bes shot at 4:25, you can see ALOT).. just food for thought. protect her next time.
Praise be to saint jimmy!
USA is so gimmicky lol
I can no longer sleep of my own volition without this video playing in the background. This will end any future relationship I will have, but the death-grip this has on me is irreversible
Whoa whoa whoa yall missed the Margaritaville Casino in Bossier City, LA!
why is eddy so good at making you feel his misery and exhaustion through a screen
Final road trip!!?? LOL. You're funny.
Too many ads to enjoy watching or even listening to. Funny how you pretended to care about class disparity, yet you filled out all the ad slots on this video. I know the difference between the automated stuff and YTers filling in. Your content is good but honestly fuck you for wasting five minutes of my life to watch 40 minutes of thr "rich guy does stuff" type of video.
47:19 LMAO WHAT 47:48 this clip is so danny
9:38 HE LOOKS SO CONCERNED MAYBE GUILTY???
Just here to see if you go to the one in Sandusky Ohio that isnt related to Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville . Its the original i think , so they got to keep it 😂 😅
37:23 wow! You’ve been to Noah’s Ark??? I absolutely love that place… Pretty much grew up there… By the way, just discovered your channel and I absolutely adore your content… Well done.
Bubba Gump’s is next?
Why am I watching this twice
what the fuck did i watch . I am watching it again thou
It sounds like money is tight.  With almost 2 million subscribers and sponsors I find it to be frustrating.
Can’t wait for next year when Eddy will visit every McDonald’s in America and eat 40 meals a day.
I love Ted.
What a sad country lol
You poor soul
The way he died right after this
I knew this day would come, the day you uploaded a new video. Now I must wait for a year for another banger
The blurred feet sent me 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
52:50 "you look lonely, I can fix that"
I’m not saying nothing… I’m just saying… watching the sunSET in Florida… with the sun to your back…  I’m trying to say the Sunrise is gorgeous in Florida and the Sunsets in California Beaches are stunning
I absolutely love the cat in the hat ride
He didn’t go to the one on Lake Lanier
i wanna watch him and ted explore eachother's bodies
I cant think of anything that describes america better than this video.
Imagine this guy going to every McDonald in America ,one day
“I think it’s tinnitus” underrated comment
“Aidsburger in paradise “
technically, you guys still need to go to the Margaritaville locations located in Puerto Rico to complete the challenge
36:32 YESSSSS!!! THE TIM MISNEY BILLBOARDS!!!🤣 They’re literally all over the place in northern Ohio. There’s probably like 10+ in my general vicinity and they’re all amazing lol
Go to every Shooneys now!
I dig the Vivaldi
I get Deep Eddy because I'm a kayaker. Eddy is a kayaking term.
lol @ that stupid "thing"
I've been to one margaritaville, in myrtle beach. it was meh.
Y’all got the key lime pie but not in key west I am truly in pain
I thought I was the only one who could handle seeing THE THING!!!! I would like to congratulate you and welcome you into the brotherhood
damn that girl got some big old rusty canons on her woooooooo make youtube vids they said okay
every non-American watching this like an anthropological documentary
Yddie.  With a Y.  Got it.
So Ted's whole demeanor changed for the happier after they slept over at Eddie's mom's house? Interesting 🤔
I think Eddy has a hang up about his feet. He mentions feet a LOT. 😂
Came here for Margaritaville, stayed for "The Thing"
Jimmy Buffet died 1 month and 12 days after the release of this video. Did anybody ever do a welfare check on the Wild Brunch Club after their Rainforest Cafe video?
now do bubba gump shrimp
Waiting for "Eating at every McDonald's in the world".
Good grief Pigeon Forge being like Wisconsin Dells is so accurate a description. I say this as someone whose parents took us to both towns multiple times for vacations, including a couple Christmases. Dollywood is worth checking out.
Was this video an optimal tax wright-off?
43:44 omg I remember when they where putting up those statues for the Rise of the beasts premieres
"You come to a place like this and you can forget about wars, you know, famine, class disparity.... I mean, all that stuff is still happening but I'm in Florida and I had a Margarita today" Pure philosophy
2:22 - I'd imagine it's the views that got you to do another one of these trips matey, lol. Be real
I can’t believe I put off watching this cause I thought there was no way you actually did it.  Well done.
I like how you keep referring to every location in a restaurant chain as "pretty standard."
Ok, now do ALL. MCDONALD. IN. NORTH. AMERICA!
pretty much the worst kind of American restaurant 😂
Now do McDonald's
8:25  The Thing is a life changing experience.  I am so glad that you got to see it.
Watching Ted gradually succumbing to Stockholm syndrome is the funniest thing...
Did you go to the one in Maui that was burnt down by the government to make way for a "Smart City?"
He forgor the Margaritaville in Boston
You must’ve stopped at Myrtle Beach   Sorry about that
17:24 was hot AF
Now eat at evrry chuck e cheese
is visiting every X now a yearly thing?
the resort in belize is horrible
Do it again.
You guys should go to all the hard rock cafes! They're everywhere!
47:12 HYPE MAN VIBE CHECK PAASED 🎉
"you clicked on the video thinking..." No i was thinking "wth is magaritavile? sounds stupid and american, try like.. being people? idk"
Unbeknownst to Eddy and Ted, by going to every single Margaritaville was the key to unshackling him from this mortal coil and freeing him so he may live forever in the great Margaritaville in the sky
Funny that he mentions the buffet cult and had a one-time experience with bucc-ees as well...so what's next - Hard Rock Cafe?
Actually LOL'd when the blurred feet popped up!
next year, every mcdonalds
I wonder where they will go this year
Maybe I just haven't gotten to experience some of these parts of the country—but what a fucking fever dream.
Alot of negative Bieber undertones in this
Attention all viewers, my stummy hurts. I'm gonna need a warm blanky and a cold margarita.
Looking forward to seeing the Medieval Times Road Trip
Hard Rock Cafes for next year 😏
The rainforest PTSD is the best
Now y’all say second and final time… but we know this has to be a trilogy amiright fellas
It's funny how different Eddy's voice is in the unedited camera clips. He sounds like a total nasally nerd lmao
The fact that you didn't call it a jimmy buffet makes me unreasonably angry
Nice. So where you going next year?
waterworld in the dells is gone btw but top secret is still there
i can't believe this dumb ass content gets so much views and disappointed in myself for watching
I loved Raglan Road in Disney springs
I don't think you are allowed to have a restaurant in Texas wthout gving it a Texas twist
I live in Chicago and having a dude drunkenly/high af yell at you while you’re posing is super authentic.
You'd really think he'd have leaned into the whole "pleasant food" thing and called himself Jimmy Buffet, but pronounced it "buff-fay."
As a Floridian, Eddie accurately predicting every Floridians response to tourists reaction to rain is killing me
now do Applebee's
As an atlanta native, i apologize for the traffic, it absolutely will happen again
9:30 The look on Ted's face when you said he did 9/11
As a non-american man, I've never even heard of jimmy or margaritavilles in my entire life. So thx for that I guess. Will be checking jimmy's entire discography now. Great vid.
It's insane to think that this video came out just a couple of months before Jimmy kicked the proverbial Margarita bucket
Trip to all the Planet Hollywoods when?
RIP Jimmy
Do Texas Roadhouse
Do runza
It’s so funny that when he was in Orlando he was so calm meanwhile Ted is loosing his mind
Those margaritaville location markers look loosely like a Samus helmet.
You should do bubba gump shrimp co next
52 minutes in, if you didnt get your entertainment value yet you are about to.
i love the difference between eddy's and teds video, ted is having a mid-life crisis, while eddy is making this seem like any other day
Glad they got this in before the Margaritaville in Vegas closed.
Wait...u didn't handicap urself playing against a 4yo?
This video unearthed a deep childhood memory of me forcing my mom to take me on The Cat in the Hat ride 4 times in a row because I loved it so much. I need to call her, I'm so sorry mom.
Hopefully another 4-5 months and we'll get another one of these 😂
Looking forward to the Hard Rock Cafe roadtrip
america so weird ilike roadside attractions
senor frogs?
I have watched this an ungodly amount if times
How can a restaurant named after a dude named Buffet not be a buffet?!
Anyone got a timestamp to each one he visits?
Wait, what about the one on the outskirts of Sandusky? Is that one even real?  Edit: Ohio
jimmy buffet steams increased by almost 110,00 plays after this video
Bro can't believe you visited Myrtle Beach. We suck bro. Never come back
Bro, I fell asleep watching this and had the worst dreams of my entire life... and I'm a combat vet, with ptsd.
You didn't go to the Seattle rainforest cafe
I know nothing about any of this but I’ll guess I should watch this.
Theres a Margaritaville in lake tahoe CA
There is only one more demon for you to face:   The Hard Rock Cafe
As a Texan myself, I cannot eat without a big puddle within five feet of me
As a Biloxi local, every time you say the name I wince.
please make a new one: I ate at every McDonald's in the Country, that would be a perfect ending to the "series"
eat at every mcdonalds in the country next
Wait a minute, he forgot the cruise ship
Where are you going this year
Dude, no way. I live literally 45 minutes away from the PCB Margaritaville.
Holy fucking shit, what a waste of time. This is the most Eddy Burback wannabe shit ever. Except it’s pointless research. Of course every chipotle location is different. Especially in fucking Ohio.
Watching this high from brownies was a blast. I laughed so hard when you felt broken and betrayed at the Mall of America location.
First it was Rain Forest Cafe then it was Margaritaville but now it’s time for…. Bubba Gump.
You guys should go to all the cheeseburger in paradises
hit or miss menu, sugary cocktails, good vibes.
Be glad burger in paradise doesnt exist anymore. For those who don't know a cheaper Margaritaville
I had like the runniest fish tacos at margaritaville in universal studios florida and I hate that I have to say that. I don't think this is what jimmy wanted.
Looking forward to the every: -Buc-cees video -Bubba Gump video -Medieval Times video -Hard Rock Cafe video
I know you said you'd never do this again, and I understand why, but God I hope you do.   This and RFC I watch like once a week. These are some of the best videos on YouTube. It's everything I want from a YT video.
Need a new restaurant chain for these guys to go to .....Dick's Last Resort anyone?
Where are the air margaritavilles in every airport?
I like how he blurred out his feet not out of modesty but because he could sell "those puppies."
More like toyota to a coma
CLASSIC getting stuck in traffic right outside atl 😂
Now go to every Medieval Times
lol this is such a 20s something thing to do  *cries in 40 year old*
I want to let it be known I got drunk with my mother on Easter and had a cheers to Eddy’s brother
Gonna need y'all to visit every Cracker Barrel now. There's only 662 so far in the US alone 😂
Now do Hard Rock Cafe
Thanks Edward! 🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹🍹
did you come to Sandusky, Ohio? we have one
i had the bbq burger at the vegas one it was actually pretty good
I love seeing both sides of these videos.
I went to a Margaritaville once the one in gatlinburg to be exact, but I was served frozen Jambalaya so I threw the plate of bs at the wall and walked out. and i never went back to another
The spiritual sequel we didn't know we needded.
not sure how I made it this long without your channel being suggested.  Glad it was, Great Content.
Do johnny rockets next
y visiting all locations Eddy embarked on a ritual that once completed allowed Jimmys soul to finally move on in peace. He’s on a be
7:47
2:08 I was drinking and spilled my drink because of the cut. Thanks Eddie.
I’m coming back to this video because I just realized that Boston has just opened its own Margaritaville. At first, I would’ve shrugged and said who cares but then I realized they have regional dishes on the menu like steamers, lobster rolls, and New England style baked haddock
proud to say that my home town has the worst margaritaville in the world
You should really start planning breaks in between a few restaurants that way you don't burn out like you do in this video
I'll be honest I've never heard of the Florida keys. I'm 24 years old. I was born in America
bubba gump shrimp NEXT!!!!
I want this life
I come back to this video & the rain forest cafe video so much. It’s become my sleep background noise.
do another restaurant eddy.
Now do every Medieval Times in America/Canada
There's at least 40 Margaritavilles in the USA alone.. Edward Backburry is a huge and massive LIAR!!
You miss one. It's a hotel in oregon
Thank you Eddy for your service of doing a tour in the margaritaville circuit.  You already sacrificed so much during your first tour in the rainforest cafes, and I'm sorry to hear of your tummy being hurt on the first day of your trip.
Turns out Jimmy had immortality as long as nobody ate at every margaritaville
Now you have to visit hamburgers in paradise
It's funny because one just opened up in South Lake Tahoe this year
20:20 hey, I’m from the Deep South (not coastal area)  and we get rain like this and trust me no one is relaxed driving in it. we’ve had to wait out some storms that heavy before in a parking lot. y’all did great ❤
2024- EATING AT EVERYSINGLE CHILIS
So I looked up the one in Orlando and they charge you for parking your own car but they also want to charge you extra money if you want valet wtf
Is a Bubba Gump or Hard Rock tour next?
Did you find his lost shaker of salt?
the green screen gag was genuinely so funny
Hay Eda there is a new margarita in Florida
2024’s should be every Medieval Times ⚔️👑
When is the follow up of you and Ted doing a vacation at Dollywood?
I come back to this video once again because my PetSmart is selling Margaritaville brand dog toys. I'm just baffled.
Skimmed through this to see the one near me is the worst one. Shocker lol
12:54 glad yall stopped at Buccees😭😭 Shoutout to NOLA and Mississippi 〽️❤️❤️
That plane famously got shot at by the Cuban government when they mistook it for a drug smuggling plane. Shout to Podcast the Ride for that true story.
14:27 hey. it’s uh. “BIL-ux-si” not. that.
37:55 I feel the obligation to tell you those are moonshine stills. East Tennessee holds onto moonshine culture like no other.
Bro said 76 years young and Jimmy died at 76 years young coincidence I think not.
Imagine them going to every Hard Rock Restaurants
you should do this with medieval times
Sir, you are a liar. You in fact did not eat at every Margaritaville in the country. You did not eat at the one in Conroe, Texas. You used this title as clickbait. Blatant clickbait.
I have something really nasty for Schlatt
I thought Ted's name was a play on television but, like, Ted. "ted-nivision" yk? i did not know it was his actual name 💀
I just can't get over how you say Biloxi
Does anyone know the name of the song @1:53
Next is definitely Planet Hollywood.
good thing you went to the Vegas Margaritaville in time cause it's been said that the Las Vegas Margaritaville will be closing this year  also i wanna suggest you guys tackle every Black Bear Diner in America it is soooooo good!
I know nobody will see this, but . . .  I just want to PSA that I literally had glass in my food at the Times Square Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville. xD   I ordered like the battered fish and chips, and, between the batter and the fish, was a legitimate piece of glass. I took a hard bite down, thinking it was something burnt, and realized swiftly, "Hmm, that's unusually hard." I took it out of my mouth and what do you know—literally glass.   No injury or anything, so I didn't bother them beyond making sure the meal was comped. But yeah that happened. 😂
You pulled the hat off. Let noone tell you differently
You guys should do Cracker Barrel!
dying of laughter honestly over the fact that the rainforest cafe is now DIRECTLY across from the margaritaville  i don’t know if it was there when you guys visited but that’s definitely a new location for it and i like to think the gods of MOA planned this in spite of you
as soon as you said you were gonna try and fit atlanta in as a quick second stop i cried for you knowing what traffic you were about to find
Now to visit every mcdonalds.
Well looks like you did this at the right time. The Vegas Margaritaville location is closing down soon.
I may do this one day, but instead of Margaritaville, I may go to all 63 of the US National Parks.
What this video has taught me: beaches are nice.
I like when he closes his eyes and looks like a muppet
Next is bubba gumps!
this is the video i fall asleep to every night
Eddy slowly falling in love with jimmy buffet is what I love for
I don’t typically watch food-themed shows/videos, but this was entertaining.   1. It’s funny how you say “Pan-a-MUH City”. We say “Pan-uh-MAW City” here in the South. Ya know, as in, “Take me down to the Panamaw City, where the grass is green and the girls are pretty…” 🎶   2. You ordered a GINGER Margarita and expected it to be something other than nasty? It sounds like 🤮 to me. (I recently learned what ginger tastes like.)   3. How did you spend 8-9 hours driving from Atlanta to Nashville? 😮 That should be a 3.5 hour drive.   4. Planning a countrywide trip around visiting the same restaurant every single day sounds like a huge waste of a trip, not to mention nauseating. But congrats on finishing, since that’s what you wanted to do.
Hard Rock Cafe.
legit question, is it not common to swim in the ocean in miami?
His tummy :(
Next time you want to do something like this you should do Hard Rock Cafe!
I found this video yesterday and ironically also passed the margaritaville in Times Square last night. I didn’t even realize until this morning. 😭
I need to see you doing all 22 Bubba Gump locations in the U.S. next 👀
“I beat the child” 🤨
Living my dream
I know you will probably never see this Monsieur Burback, but i felt it was super important to tell you that there are margaritaville crocs now... they... they exist.. and they have icecube jibbitz™
I need you to know that you inspired us. When me and one of my partners went to Vegas we went out of our way to go to Margaritaville. In matching tourist shirts. The food was solid but not impressive.. The drinks was really where it got interesting. My partners was incredibly strong... And I'm not sure they put mixers in mine. It tasted like a sweaty shirt. Amazing 10 out of 10 experience absolutely fit with everything else that happened to us in Vegas.... (And yeah we may have dropped into the rainforest Cafe for a second while we were there too)
Hard Rock Cafe this summer?
Ive been to the Margaritaville in Hollywood, FL and I always loved it! Good to know its one of the better ones.
this video caused me permanent hearing damage
R.I.P Jimmy
It's like the trauma of eating at every Rainforest Cafe got to Eddy, and the only way he could cope was by forming an unhealthy bond with an entirely different themed restaurant chain
You guys should do ever hard rock next
Key West will do that to you. I hate beaches, tropical themed stuff, heat and humidity, and SOMEHOW am obsessed with Key West. The place exists in a different dimension, I swear.
RIP a king
32:23 the way Ed was just waving… like who you waving to? RIP in Jimmy!
Next trip should be Buba Gump Shrimp Co.
Every Hard Rock Cafe next ?
2024 could be the year of Bubba Gump Shrimp 🦐
This is my third or fourth time watching this I am so tired
52:50 "you look lonely. I can fix that"
You should try and eat at Every Hard Rock Cafe in the United States next. There is a total of 31 locations in the US.
Hoping y’all do Hard Rock Cafe next. Each location has unique food items local to the city it is in
you are what you eat. you are margaritaville.
from MS. never heard Biloxi pronounced that way
The Pigeon Forge one brought back so many memories that I completely forgot I had. I used to got there all the time when I was a kid, and I recognized almost every place he showed.
I love how this was like a realization of how you don't need to be exactly like Jimmy Buffett, but there was always a Jimmy Buffett inside you. Not an original Jimmy Buffett, but something you've created. I don't know where I was going with this.
Hey look a McDonald’s OH GOD NO ITS HAPPENING AGAIN
This and the companion video to every rain forest cafe have become a hyper fixation for me
they’ve explored each others bodies
If the last video was the live action of the goofy movie. This one is A EXTREMELY goofy movie.
ya'll should do every waffle house next
Go to bubba Gump Shrimp. Do it!!! You know you have to!!
Can't wait til you visit every Bubba Gump next!
38:56 broke me LMAO
This is such an entertaining series I can't wait for part three
Ted’s joie de vivre is unmatched
rest in peace mr buffett he would have loved this video
Next year: every midevil times
Jumbalaya on the same day you got diarrhea is brave😂
Next, do all the Shakey's, you cowards!
always cracks me up seeing youtubers feel like time has been wasted making so much money <3 great vid
Sooooo same time next year? Are y'all doing Medieval Times next, or Buck-ee's, or Chuck E Cheese, orrrr....
Yall should do Bubba Gump shrimp or old country buffet next
I can’t believe i watched all of it but loved every second of it
You know youre a limp wristed, soy boy, when ur biggest complaint about an alcoholic cocktail is its sugar content...
thank you for absolving me of having to visit the thing. i live in southern AZ and see billboards for it Constantly
His final boss is going to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada
as someone who grew up going to destiny mall, i 100% agree that the margaritaville there is very disappointing and sad. i dont think ive actually seen that blender work in my life
Now, we all know, despite Eddy claim this is the last time, it's not gonna be the last time
Rip Jimmy 🖤
harvey strerdew vallet
2025 buck-ees tour , go to all 58 buck-ees
28:35
Seeing my local mall (Destiny) here was nuts and I’m happy to know we have the worst margaritaville !
I wonder if you would ever do a Margaritaville at seas? Like the final secret boss
I’m here in 2024…waiting on the next road trip…waiting…  Waiting…  Waiting…
You gotta do a third road trip!! Come on!!
Next do every Bubba Gump's
hahahahahaa. The "I'm from Florida and the rain isn't such a big deal part had me dying" Because i was looking at that rain thinking. Oh that isn't so bad for Florida rain.
You guys should do every Hard Rock!
Ngl roadtripping in a pickup sounds terrible, you have to strap everything down if you use the bed and its easier to steal stuff from, if you don't use the bed you loose like 80% of your storage space, also you have to be in a pickup for something that's not being used for utility which is embarrassing
Please go to every bubba gumps restaurants.
Have u been to margartiville at sea?????
buc-ee's kind of sounds like its a supermarket, that has a gas station
IT'S OVER 9000 miles
Missed one in MO!
I can’t help but feel like he somehow thought that The Four Seasons by Vivaldi was a Jimmy Buffett song at 3:25.
…Pigeon Forge??  What the hell kind of place name is that?!
I loved the sequel even more 😂❤🎉
There is one more margaritaville in Missouri!!!! At the lake! I was hoping to see it
DO HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT!!!👏🏽👏🏽
you drinking and driving doesnt really sit well with me honestly tbqhf
Funny enough, this video sparked my interest in Margaritaville when it first came out - I can now say that I’m a huge jimmy Buffett fan lol
The Rare Sequel that lives up to the Original
hey u missed jacksonville beach. the title is a sham. redo the trip
Crazy that this video single-handedly killed Jimmy Buffet
47:11 props to whoever that dude was being a hype man-
I can die happy after seeing Justin Bieber use a hardcore smoke machine on his fans 😂😂😂😂😂
Your pants are on fire cuz you didn’t go to every margaritaville, don’t be a liar liar next time and you’ll get my thumbs up. There’s one in Missouri and you didn’t go, so you’ll need a fire extinguisher for them pants.
YOU GUYS DIDN'T GO TO THE MARGARITAVILLE RESORT IN PALM SPRINGS THO!!!
I watched this video and decided to learn Margaritaville on drums. I will raid your house during the night just so you can hear it in person.
I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the Country - coming soon in 2024
Next challege: visit every McDonald's in the country
This is the third time I am watching this. 🫣 😂
why
Eddy is an official Tummy Ache Survivor™️ (TAS)
He skipped the Cleveland Margaritaville  Edit: nevermind, I'm just dumb
You killed a legend with this trip, I hope you know that
The European mind cannot comprehend this video
49:50 Well… what else are you going to do on the toilet for that long?
You must of had the shits for a year straight😂
I have to travel a lot for work. Sometimes crossing 5 states in one day. I always think "I wonder where that/those people are going?" "Wonder what's their destination"  Now I can add "I bet those people are eating at the same restaurant in every state"
My favorite sexyman video
When are you going on the Margaritaville cruise?
Really brought a new meaning to “wasting away again in Margaritaville”
As an Englishman, I just gotta say, that looked like some of the shitest fish and chips ever. Looked like icelands savers fish
ok, why did you not hit the one in Jacksonville, Florida?
I recently learned there are margaritaville cruises. You guys missed out.
THERES A MARGARITA VILLE CRUISeEe
eddy you need to go on the margarita ville cruise ship
last trip?? nooooo but yeah there really isnt another restaurant chain you can do this with can you
random Schlatt sighting
if you cosplay bucee are you a furry or a cosplayer
Margaritaville Cruise When?
I think this needs to be a series 🤷
U didn’t go to the one in Detroit’s airport
You skipped Crystal Beach.
House of Blues 🗣️🗣️
why no Margaritaville Lake Resort?
So excited for next years' trip to all 33 Hard Rock Cafes in the US and Canada! :DDD I'm sure this will be GREAT for Eddy's mental health.
Didn’t get to see in South Carolina when the tornado sends down a giant tequila bottle it’s sick
jimmy died 2 months after this video wwas uploaded
all of this is way too american for an european mind to comprehend
Dude has ptsd against rainforest cafe lol
Every chilis roadtrip 2025?
Eyeee I live in pcb and as a local I hate pier park lol but it’s fun tho lol super cool that you came down!
Very happy the Atlanta location was sweet enough to let y'all in and give you some pretty good food :3
Next year can we please see you visit all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Cos?
I don’t think jimmys gonna see this…..
The fact that the Rainforest Cafe PTSD reminds me of how Robin Williams had PTSD from the original Jumanji movie is wild
Welcome to ohio, its about as bad as they say
Whhooo a dog boy?? Buddy the dogo close to the end of the video!
I know they will do another video together. These videos do well and they have a comedy and adventurous spirit they have to them. Rip Jimmy
crazy to think that someone won 10k and didnt comment about it
I challenge you to go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Including Mexico and Canada
Oh my god, there's a Tim Misny cameo.
Rip jimmy buffet.
RIP Jimmy
my dad and i always hit up margaritaville whenever we drive down to the river walk lmfao
Bubba Gump shrimp co next
Hard rock cafe, Bubba Gump shrimp co, dicks last resort, medieval times. You guys have atleast 4 years to go!
ok now eat at every medieval times dinner and tournament, you wont.
Missed one in bossier city Louisiana
Petition for a part 3 featuring Quinton Reviews so he can finally have his dream of going to every themed McDonald's remaining in the country before they all die
Now do a Road Trip to EVERY SINGLE HARD ROCK CAFE IN THE COUNTRY(And Canada)!!!
Gonna have to do a chiles run next
46:32 Misny makes em pay
Have you started on Hard Rock Cafe yet or are you going to keep us guessing?
I’ve seen this video probably four times now. It doesn’t get old. You guys have to do another one like this!
You should do McDonalds next ❤
If you do this again you should do the hard rock cafe's
You didn’t go to the one in Bossier City, LA 😅
eddy if you ever come back to south carolina again im going to get you
Next you need to go to all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co's across the country
This video made me hungry
I am so happy that you discovered The Thing! It's a local treasure.
Very glad to see slander against the Margaritaville in Destiny USA. The most people I've seen at once were 15 people or so and they were all mall santas who met together LMAO
do Ihop!
You absolutely need to got to all the hard rock cafes
Bro how did that hand grenade from bourbon street make you feel?
did i miss the funny? was this supposed to be funny?
Hard Rock Cafe next
FUCK THE CLEVELAND OHIO MARGARITAVILLE
why are they always at the checkout isle when u get lost at bucees 😂
Did he go to the one in buford georgia?
Ok now go to every Burger King
It’s crazy that Eddy and Ted teased in the last frame of the video that bubba gump is going to be next
Do Not go to the margaritaville in the Cancun airport. that airport is actually hell :D  also consider: FLAVOR TOWN
Fly high jimmy😢
Its almost poetic that jimmy buffet died the same year that this ultimate challenge took place RIP
"BilauxE"
The margarita in the hand of the Statue of Liberty turning red to that dramatic music was the most Bloodborne-ass thing I've ever seen in a casual dining chain.
now do every mcdomald in the us
Did you remove the link to the merch shop or am I blind? I also tried looking it up, but there was nothing
!!!!!!!BUC-EE'S MENTIONED!!!!!!
As a Texan, can confirm that big ol puddles are native
Love your videos. I gotta get this out of my system; you look like Mario if he never became a plumber.  That doesn't mean you aren't a beautiful man.
This is actually such a nice final tribute to Jimmy
God damn YouTubers are so rich. A 22 day road trip is no joke
Bubba Gump next
48:23 new weezer album cover
13:24 OH I finally understand what Sammy the Squirrel was referencing in Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein
Just to be evil: Hard Rock Cafe next??👀👀
47:12 that guy did not lie tho
Everyone is saying Hard Rock Cafe for their next cross country trip, but I have a better challenge...one that makes Hard Rock Cafe look like child's play: Eating at Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the country...and (if they want to go for it) Mexico.
The only logical next step is Hard Rock. He can’t avoid it forever.
You know what, I get it. Me and Ted share one crucial trait: The acceptance of enjoyability when the option of escape is gone.
I feel like Buc-ee’s is the Wawa of the South.
Your descent into cultish jimmy madness is 👌
It’s so nice to know you lost your spirit in the place where my family vacations, cause sometimes that’s where I lose my spirit too. Thanks Pigeon forge ✨
The rainforest cafe in the MOA used to be on the bottom floor. Don't know when they changed it.
Am I crazy or isn’t there a margaritaville hotel in Houston?? My cousin worked at the Starbucks there I swear!!!
Your description of pigeon Forge, is spot on, and is why Ive hated living here for the past 15 years. 😂😂 great video!
Why though
Cape Cod finally gets a Margaritaville! Waiting for it
The fact that neither of these videos mention the fact there is a margaritavile MUSICAL makes me wanna Jimmy my Buffet
So wait 34:25. You called to confirm the operating hours of the establishment. Yet when you got there before closing hours they were shut down?  And you were thankful that they would give you any service at all after directly speaking with them earlier that they stated the kitchen was open until 11 PM?  And you are giving great reviews to the staff for not being reliable and providing you a limited menu?  I mean I'm not trying to be a Karen here but your reaction of "how great" it was is truly ridiculous.   Grow some.
Please go to every medieval times in North America there are 9 in the US and one in CN
I was legit just at the Mall of America. I remember seeing Margaritaville right across from the Rainforest Cafe. And I thought "isn't there a guy on YouTube that went to both of these?"
Good (bad) news! There is a new Margaritaville opening here on Cape Cod!
Do bubba gump next
Haha now go to bubba gump
fun seeing the margaritaville i went to
I feel like you should do this same idea but with Miller’s Ale House. Complete the trilogy, so to speak 😂
surprisingly fun video. I thought you would lose my interest quick, but this was a GREAT hangover watch
bro DID NOT eat at every margarittaville
... Hear me out road trip for every Bubba Gump's restaurant
The 2024 road trip needs to be visiting an Olive Garden in each state during the never ending pasta bowl promo.
Very cool roastrip, but maybe you should cut down on the sweet alcohol drinks, that really messes you up and ruins the fun when you are sick all the time, my last trip was filled with too many tequila shots, no more, i wanted to die
43:33 IT'S HIM! OHIOANS UNITE UNDER HIM
WWJD WHAT WOULD JIMMY DO
Rest In Peace Jimmy. Your empire lives on
I wonder if this place is completely funded by boomers and gen x and will go out of business when they die. Cause who really likes jimmy buffet or the song margaritaville that much
48:29 saving this part for later
13:20 you were like a mom who lost their 5 year old son.
The last road trip? But....But...What about Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?! Hard Rock Cafe?! (I would dare you to go to every Taco Bell, but I truly believe no human could survive that!!)
gotta do hard rock cafe next.
Why they hell would you rent a Tacoma for a trip like  that
The saga of Ted and Eddy. A story of brotherhood and discovery
If you look around you can notice Offcanny merch all over youtube, ted had a shirt in this vid
Do it again 😂
Welcome back president Roosevelt
Don’t worry you didn’t miss much but 2 hr long lines at dollywood people from Tennessee don’t actually go there😂
Eddy’s ultimate mission, every McDonald’s in the United States
next should be going to every McDonalds in the country
The trip that killed Jimmy Buffet😢
It's like Ted develops Stockholm syndrome, not towards you, but towards the restaurants
That silent, go-getting stinky feet child is gonna be president one day
Congratulations you should go to every medieval times next year! The chain restaurant that makes u feel like ur a knight
So proud of you. Next time on Eddy and Ted Road Trip across America for Mediocre to Okay Food: Hard Rock Cafe.
You know, Eddy, you don't have to eat everything on your plate 😂
Liked this before even watching. Margaritaville is like a fake thing to me cuz I always see it but never been LOLOLOL this is content 👍
man killed jimmy buffet
I can't wait for this man to go psych. I'm going to another theme restaurant all around the country and Canada
I like to think of life having achievements. Thinking these guys may have gotten the first ever “every Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville” achievement is hilarious to me.
RIP Jimmy Buffet  While Eddy may have barely survived, Jimmy wasted away in Margharitaville
rip to the cooks who thought they had an early night in the kitchen
The way he showed his merch was like "what im a sellout?"
Ted utterly terrifies me
Jimmy Buffet sounds like Michel from GTAV
We apparently have 2 Margaritavilles here in Puerto Rico...I sorta wonder other sections of the non continental US have them too?
there's a brand new Margaritaville location in south lake tahoe, CA and i immediately thought of this video 😭 so technically u haven't been to every Margaritaville in the US 🫡
Imagine getting an ADHD urge to do something random like visiting every margaritaville in the country and you’re a YouTuber so you make money on it and you can write it off on your taxes as a business expense. This man is living the dream.
Wafflehouse next? They only have... over 1900 locations
Crazy how the Stature of Liberty with the margarita is like a prequel to the sphere video. Bravo Vince
Great video. I know people are saying hard rock but actually I was looking and Medieval Times is actually more doable and has a nice cross country spread with only 10 restaurants. Just saying
The traffic coupled with the top tier customer service is very Atlanta, coming from an ATLian
Isn't there a Margaritaville in Hawai'i?
I wouldn’t be pooping right ever again for the rest of my life if I did that
No one made you drink the margaritas every day bro
But you didn't eat at the Margaretaville in San Juan Puerto Rico.
Theres a cruise ship in margheritavile branding, that should count
Bro, this guy completely forgot the conre TX location 😢😢WHY!!!!!
RIP jimmy buffet
I took the Margaritaville cruise to the Bahamas with my wife for our honeymoon last fall, two weeks after Buffet died. It was really interesting hearing the workers euligize Buffet while we were kicking back drinks at the 5 o'clock Somewhere bar, or eating at the Cheeseburger in Paradise. The concert footage certainly...hit different lol.
this video brought me an unbelievable amount of joy
It’s it’s kind of funny how like Ted got concerned when you blamed him for 9/11 like he definitely caused it
Am I the only one that noticed he missed the one in pensacola Beach florida?
feet came up 3 times in this video and i'm only at minute 20  edit: now 4 times edit2: 5 edit3: 6 times edit4: 7 (i didn't expect there to be so many times)
Cheesecake Factory next? Word of warning: if you plan to go to the one in Canada, be prepared to wait 3 hours for a table. And no, they do not take reservations.
bruh these menu prices im dying
I often sit and wonder if Jimmy Buffet saw this masterpiece before his passing.
Petition for Brayden to appear in the next roadtrip
As someone who lives right near pigeon forge can confirm its fun
"and of course we left a tip" thank you. my questions have been answered.
we miss you jimmy
16:08 that’s funny   ❤😂😂❤   16:24 ?
40:58 Holy shit Jimmy has a domain expansion. That's wild, I didn't know he was such a strong sorcerer.
Bubba Gump Shrimp next please 🙏🏻 maybe you and Ted will finally be on the same page 📄
In the country or in the country of USA?
It's gonna be Hard Rock Cafe next
Holy shit it’s Cleveland legend Tim Misney!!!!
How Mu
57:04 Goodbye, Jimmy.
How come you didn't go to any "cheeseburger in paradise" restaurants? Also Lulu's is lucy buffets restaurant which is his sister and is actually good in my opinion 😅 in Gulf shores Alabama
is anyone else weirded out that another guy posted a video about going to every Margaritaville on the SAME day?
What about South Padre Island, TX Margaritaville D:
I just know you have IBS
Bros glazing
5:06 "fully-prepared" as in not prepared at all XD the only thing music related is the drum-set. It's missing about 95% of what is required to play. Not a correction, but a hint that this is just for display or they simply just don't have anyone scheduled.
I like the video but to much crying
Lucky guy she is hot
How much did Ted smoke before #20 😂
wait what about the margaritaville in osage beach, mo?
Do medieval times
Looking forward to “I visited every Starbucks in the US”
Here's a fun one for y'all. Cracker Barrel. There's a couple who they talk about in Cracker Barrel's training videos that have visited every restaurant that opens. It's even seen as a big deal on the level of a District/Regional Manager visit when they show up.
Rip
I’m just waiting on the Outback Steakhouse video to drop
should’ve gone to the lanier islands margaritaville. severe oversight
Where do I send money for the toes?
48:23 This reminds me of that one Weezer album cover
Quick correction. The Margaritaville Hotel in Biloxi did not used to be a Margaritaville casino. That was located across town. The building where the Margaritaville hotel is used to be a place called casino magic. Both of those casinos closed to bankruptcy. The hotel is an entirely separate project from the Margaritaville casino
I believe one is opening in Galveston, Texas. Now you have to go!
what colour was ur poop the morning of stomach pain prior driving to bloomington m8? <3
bubba gump restaurant next?
you are gay
30:42 THAT FUCKING RIDE IS SO FUNNY I graduated last year and for Gradventure we went to Universal. We had 20 minutes to get back on the bus and my friends had a great idea: ride that hideous ride. Ill never forget it.
Anyways yeah Orlando stuff tends to be very gaudily beach decorated because tourists, and they love to have it shoved in their face. If only they knew the beach people from Orlando use is right next to crackhead red tide STD central estuary (aka. the Indian River). I live 20 mins from it I think I might have a few mutations from the wind currents.
This and the rainforest cafe are 6 months apart, and its currently 6 months since this video....im counting on them going to the hard rock cafe pretty soon here lol
See you next time when you visit every Cheesecake Factory.
This is pure americana. This is what America is all about
Drinks a gallon of lime bar mix - wonders why his 'tummy hurts'.  I can't...
Dude, Food Poison, happens, seriously
Next vid- eating at every AIR margaritaville! saw one at the detroit airport on an overnight layover
I see Bubba Gump in your future.
He missed a margarita villa in the United States there is one on St Thomas in the Virgin Islands
Now that's how u do you tube videos ❤❤
Medieval TIMMMMEEEESSSS
Hard Rock Cafes in 2024?
37:24 AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pidgon Forge Titanic museum!!! PIDGON FORGE TITANIC MUSEUM!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dave and Buster's next?
I am the king of stinky feet 😂
Seeing YouTubers experience region specific vacation places that I’ve personally done is weird as hell
Awesome video, what if you are at every Hard Rock Cafe in the US?
why rent a tacoma and not something closed in and more comfortable, ah, took time off, hope this one is better, and after this off to Teds channel, I liked his Rainforest a whole lot better,
Cant wait for next year's road trip video bro
Loved the Trauma in your eyes at the sight of rainforest cafe
Anyone else sad that he didn't hit the Margaritaville Cruise up while he was in Florida?
Going to every Subway in the USA next
49:47
You broke the curse.  Jimmy Buffett was finally able to ascend to the big blender in the sky.
This was dumb af
Going on my first vacation with my parents since before COVID. You won’t fucking believe what resort i’m at right now.
did...did you not want to take a more efficient car?
Biloxi is pronounced BULL•UCK•ZEE- a local
Who da f. Is Jimmy buffett? First time I heard about this guy. Never heard any of his songs. So this is some kind of USA nishe folklore?
why
I feel that if you guys started the trip the other way, the last locations would be tropical and way more fun. But it would take away the fun of watching Eddy spiraling into madness
Tried to get a drink at the Palm Springs resort the other day without success. Why was that one skipped on the tour?
Having never seen your content before, let me just say, great video and your mustache is next level excellent.  From a new fan who appreciates a man and his mustache. ❤ Edit: Is that…Jarvis Johnson in the first restaurant? Damn, amazing.
Wroward Wounty
You should do Hard Rock Café next
I lost it at the Jimmy’s Jammin Jambalaya 😂😂
Watching this as a distraction while I get a rib tattoo. Cheers.
Florida doesn't have volcanoes; someone is senile and mistaking Hwaii and Florida. Where's the pork and pineapple dish?
I love that Ted is wearing a the thing shirt
3:08 you know you're in for a ride when the Dragoon music begins to play
This is what a descent into madness looks like
R.I.P. Jimmy Buffett… never was a fan of this franchise, but was a HUGE fan of his music. Another legend gone… too few “Trips Around the Sun…” 😢🌴🦈🩴🍔🧉
Rip jimmy
Thanks for disliking the one in Syracuse, everyone in Syracuse pretty much dislikes the one in Syracuse as well.
edward it's been about six months, I'm gonna need you to go to every Denny's this time
He's slowly loosing his mind 😂
18:13 Glad you had fun, be glad you didn't go to Lynn Haven, thats where all the crackheads are
now that you've been to panama city you'll never stop wanting to leave!
this video is like a bad habit you keep coming back even though it’s pure insanity
omg I just realized jimmy wasn't dead yet when this video was uploaded
cringe video.
I just realized I know exactly what gas station they're at in 49:20 just by the look of the rocks past Ted, I drive past there every season for deer hunting!!
Every McDonald's next 😂
Hes slowly understanding what the song is about
the timing of this upload... um... did you kill Jimmy on this trip?
I honestly don't know how you completed this trip without a massive amount of weed. That's the only way I could've eaten that food every day- sometimes multiple times a day with Jimmy Buffet haunting you the entire trip 😅
They just broke ground on a new Margaritaville in Galveston, TX, the franchise grows.
Lol....The Thing.... you have to stop!
now imagine if they went to every great wolf lodge. that would be sick, just staying at all of them
Hi eddy, i am the dolphin from that beach there, forgot its name. They look allthesame to me 🤷‍♂️ my name is james btw, so you are right,i saw your feet what do i owe you?
Need a link to this margaritaville song that Chrissy made...
Jimmy was all about the music
I live about 10 minutes from the one in myrtle beach, been there more time's then i can count, i had no idea there where more or they they where centered around Jimmy Buffett
Jiimy died after this video , wild
Do every chain restaurant in the US and you will have to come back to San Antonio like 50 times
every time i see drew gooden i get whiplash, lol. i went to highschool with that guy and dated his friend, so i saw him every day. i had to do a doubletake when i first saw him on yt
I fucking love the metal clanging music associated with the rainforest trauma
Eat at every bubba gump shrimp
Mcdonalds?
do LLBean please
Sooo... Nobody's gonna talk about Ted needing the whole ass room for... "work"? 14:35
Next time, bring a doctor and finish up in rehab.
Did you go to the one in Palm springs?
The reasons Rainforest Cafe is horrible and traumatizing is in 2009 it was purchased along with many other chains like McCormick and Schmick’s by the Landry’s corporation.  They come in and cut the soul out of a restaurant for profit.  They’re a heartless corporation whose CEO literally stated that his philosophy is “mediocrity sells.”  Avoid their restaurants, they charge their staff to work there, reuse food for guests, and have horrific safety standards.
38:40 This must be what it's like living in North Korea
Hahaha that Alien museum was the laugh i needed today
09:07 Christians hate this xD
Isn’t there another one in Sandusky, Ohio?
Bubbagumpshrimp gotta be next
6 more months before we get to see them do Bubba Gumps
its a state of mind
God rest his soul
If you guys ever make it back to Key West, go find the Chart Bar at the end of Duval in a hotel. It was the 1st bar Jimmy played at regularly. They have free popcorn, free hot dogs and STIFF drinks.  Rest in Peace our sweet sweet prince
I don’t care what anyone says, when your tummy hurts, it can be the fucking worst.
I wonder if he ever saw this video, I hope so. I like to think it'd give him a good chuckle, RIP Jimmy
The reason why the buns at the Myrtle Beach Margaritaville are wet, is because they steam them.
Now do Bubba Gump’s
Thank you for coming to San Antonio Texas
Jimmy better fucking comment
I'm a Clevelander and I got unreasonably excited to see Tim Misny in this video.
Bubba Gump next? 😂
Now go on a trip to see all the in and out’s in the country
I've been a resident of the Cleveland area my whole life thus far and I had no idea we had a Margaritaville. Knowing this, I still will not be trying it.
Lol gaslightjng ted on that door squeak, it was so loud!
What about the Margaritaville in the US Virgin Islands?
so..... Bubba Gumps restaurants next
Maybe Ted had Stockholm Syndrome and that's why he suddenly liked it
What do you eat for the next few days after doing something like this?
This video his a bit different after his passing.  Thanks for your sacrifices, and RIP Jimmy
Do FuddRuckers next
Rip jimmy
I really hope you guys do Bubba Gumo Shrimp in 2024
Ted's always having a wonderful time and Eddy is always experiencing a descent into hell.
26:39 mmmmhhhh
Dude I remember balling my eyes out on the Dr. Suess ride as a kid. I thought I was just being a baby until this video lmao.
5 o Clock somewhere 🥃🍺
You might want to do a parasite cleanse when you get home 😮😮😮
My vote is for the next road trip is Hard Rock Cafes!
i live in the houston area by a margaritaville resort and i had no idea they were different. thank you for educating me
42:03  rasin Cannes briefly shown on screen I don’t know why I recognize this I’ve never ate there
my dad and i drove nearly three hours to the margaritaville in canada because of this video, i am not joking
I own multiple pieces margaritaville merchandise none of which i paid for
When in doubt, you say "What would Jimmy Buffett do?"
I’m from the UK and have never heard of Jimmy Buffet or Margaritaville, however this video has sent me down the rabbit hole and I’m only just finding out that jimmy has passed away 😢
This was EPIC. Thank you for the entertainment fine sir!
Did you do ohio?
Fun fact, There used to be a Margaritaville in New Orleans. I worked there 15 years ago. It was in the French Quarter. BB Kings is in that location now. It would have been funny if you had visited the old location to pay homage to the fallen Margaritaville. lol
What about the one in Honolulu?
I hope Jimmy saw this before be passed.
Missed opportunity, should’ve called it jimmies buffet
Your mustache looks like a boomerang
i wonder if this is the video that killed jimmy buffett
here i thought you learned your lesson.
I see that once again burger Frankenstein has been neglected i expect this to be rectified in the hard rock cafe video ted will also have an opportunity for redemption
Bubba gump shrimp
TULSA MENTIONED 🎉🎉🎉
the next step is eating at every bass pro shops
So, the late Jimmy Buffet also owned Landshark, which is hilarious because the restaurants are literally just Margaritavilles with a different name on the front.  Edit:  I forgot until about 22 minutes into this that before every shift, after the shift meeting, you had to go "hands in" and on three everybody unenthusiastically said "fins-up".  Nothing says corporate waitressing job like weird taglines you are forced to use every day.  (Oh, also, my job was on the beach in Daytona, but for some weird reason we weren't allowed to wear tank tops.  Like, its 95 degrees out and my shoulders have to be covered?  Thanks Jimmy.)
1:53 I almost wish he pronounced Ted’s last name wrong
I think it was a good way to spend time and I think you should do it again
Schlatt showing up is always a jumpscare, in any context.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅RAHHH SAN ANTONIO MENTIONED WTF IS GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE 🦅 🇺🇸🇺🇸
i've never had a single glass of alcohol in my whole life so idk if it's ok, but issit ok for danny to drive after drinking a cocktail?
2 years in a row, the best experience they had at an american restaurant was in a canadian location 😤😤
47:53 my guy on the right looks unhappy
next is bubba gump shrimp
5:15 AIDSBURGER IN PARADISE
rip Jimmy Buffet
There’s a new one being opened in Cincinnati. So you didn’t get the future :(
Next year: "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country"
Do McDonald’s next.
Jschlatt is a shidder I can't believe they're friends with that dude. Absolute garbage-tier dude, bad attitude and personality.
As a Texan, I held my breath through your trip from El Paso to Beaumont. I was so ready to throw hands and I can't explain why.
Buc-ee's!! RAHHHHHH
No one asked for this
"Because no matter how stressed my life gets, mentally I have to be just like Jimmy Buffet." Why did that cure my procrastination?
what about margaritaville in St Thomas!
Next up: every McDonald’s in the country
It's such a shame they don't have a Buffett Buffet
Call me cynical but I don’t think that 35:00 restaurant deserves any praise.  You arrived at 10:00pm when they close at 11:00pm, they didn’t really do you a favour; they did their job.  The free drinks and meal was pretty dope tho
Can’t wait for the Hard Rock Cafe episode
Visiting every theme park in the US video when.
Lies! They didn't go to every one. They missed at least one in California in Capitola!
nice to know my margaritaville is the worst 😭
19:50 a cloud looks like the stairway to heaven
It's so funny seeing Eddy's and Ted's videos for comparison
Canada having the best one is hilarious. Now I have to go 😂
THIS BUCEES HATE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
The more you say Jimmy, the more I think about Better Call Saul
i am from florida and the rain is not a big deal. yes, i already told mickey and he told me you are a wimp
Jimmy Buffet mfs when the crushing weight of reality finally sets in:
I'm really enjoying the use of Vivaldi.  Also There is a Margaritaville in the Detroit airport.
Next up: I ate at every Joe's Crab Shack (30 locations in 12 states)
I desperately need to know how fundamentalist Christian’s would react to the “What If aliens came to earth during the time of the dinosaurs” exhibit
I misheard “22 locations” as “202 locations” and had to rewind to make sure Eddy wasn’t about to go on a 2 year road trip nightmare
I know his liver was crying at the end of this trip
4:24 nice ;)
Only 2 months later the KING himself Jimmy Buffet passed away at least the legacy of this trip happened during his life
Go do Bubba Gumps
Why would you rent a truck for a cross country road trip?
Didn't y'all miss the Margaritaville in Conroe, Texas
That margaritaville resort was literally just the fnaf pizzaplex
You look exactly like the kind of guy who would eat at every margaritaville in the country.
Hard Rock Cafe! Hard Rock Cafe!
Why would you travel so much to go to a restaurant that you know is supposed to be the same as the one you've seen?
No one gonna mention how cute Chrissy is?
I feel like you should do these trips in reverse next time.... judging by how it goes normally
should eat at every mcdonalds
He said Biloxi like 'bill' 'oxy' but locals say it more like 'bull' 'uck'see'
39:47 I died laughing irl
Did I miss it, or did you? Lake of the Ozarks Margaritaville, formerly known as Tan-Tar-A
did this video kill jimmy buffett
rainforest cafe gave him psych damage while margaritaville did physical
The chicken on the salads looks dry aged
Well, this video was how I found out the Phoenix Margaritaville was closed 😢
The first time, ted was having fun and eddy was miserable, this time it was the opposite (kinda). So i assume that there will be one more where they both are miserable
You should do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next.
They're putting a Margaritaville resort in Newport Kentucky which is basically Cincinnati Ohio.
Fail. No Honolulu.
how much for toes
eddie.. there's a margaritaville at sea... a margaritaville cruise
The best thing about being a Chicagoan is how easy and free it is to amuse people lmao. Take people to a big ass metal bean
Bro, just ask how the Fish and Chips are. Ask “Is it fresh fish?”
There’s one in SD now so you gotta drink one there too
See kids, this is what can happen when you're the far less talented half of a YouTube duo and you throw your "friend" and partner under the bus for allegations later proven to be almost entirely false!
Go home eddy you’re drunk
Jimmy Buffet truly did make a cult. I watch this as a form of tribute at least once a month.
Can't wait for next year!
Doing this would make me a vegetarian for the rest of my life afterwards
Out of all of them I gotta say the Cleveland one looked the best!!!!!
YOU SKIPPED THE NASHVILLE MARGARITAVILLE HOW COULD YOU?!?
Hey, I don't know if you hate yourself this much. But you should go to ever fuddrockers in the usa. There's 16. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants here in colorado.
The best thing I got from this video is that apparently Aliens have a whole bakery
you're very brave..
Now do every McDonald's in America
What I’ve learned from these two videos is to go to Canada.
So hyped for the ”I ate at every McDonald’s in the Country” installment in this series!
Different tone watching this now that Jimmy Buffet and his wife are on the Epstein list
that guy crumping in Miami is the funniest shit ive seen in a long time. great vid
NAKEYJAKEY?
Miss the Margarataville that used to be in Sydney. :(
5:31 Jimmys watching from Margaritaville
First time I ever went on the Cat in the Hat ride I was tripping on acid lmao
I really don't give a shit about any of this. Do you hear me youtube algorithm?
Hitting every Hard Rock Cafe in The US and Canada when?
proud resident of the worst Margaritaville on the list o7
Now go to all the Hooters in the country. 😆
Yo I was at the one in gatlinburg and saw you guys there. Wish i said hi but you guys looked busy lol and I had to rush a bit
I'm gonna be honest I think watching this video may have killed Jimmy  In a good way though
They actually opened a Margaritaville in Boston after you and Ted made this video. It was the first Margaritaville to open after Jimmy Buffett's death
Heres a gauntlet thown at your feet, something my dad attempted but never accomplished.... Every Cracker Barrel. Your move.
can’t wait to see the video next year where you go to every bubba gump shrimp
Next one every McDonalds in the USA ^^
49:50 glad Ted started to have fun!
You should do Old Spaghetti Factory next.
Heavy rain in Florida? Shocking.
That Miami Margaritaville had SHADOW PEOPLE in it on New Years
Found out my town has a margaritaville through this video so... there's that.
9:32 Jschlatt..
I think Eddie Burback killed Jimmy Buffet
Eddie I just saw there's a Margaritaville cruise.  Sounds like a sequel to this video is in order.
RIP Jimmy :(
Honestly this is a pretty good ad. Never heard of this restaurant but i live like 40-60min away from Niagara so now i feel like i must make a trip there!  Also i will say, i do find american franchising culture kind of fascinating. Even the Buc-ee's thing. I just don't think we have anything on that level in Canada? And the all the themed restaurants too! I've never seen that in Canada other than Niagara, and like the odd standalone bar here and there (like there's this adorable tiki bar in Montreal).
This is why you drink plenty of water🤔 44:03
how is there always a blade runner vibe in every video!
Shoutout to the one AMAZING manager at the Margaritaville that let them in after closing. People are shocking willing to help out when you explain what' going on, ironically even more so when the reason is legitimate but also EXTREMELY stupid.
LMAOOO Jarvis-Spotting
RIP Jimmy… you will always be remembered and loved!
3:55 hahahahahahahaha
No wonder your tummy hurt if the first substantial meal you ate that day was an evening cheeseburger!
9:09 Thiccc
OVER 9000!!!!!! 7:17
JARVIS SIGHTING??👀 5:02
NAKEY JAKEY SIGHTING?👀 4:06
RIP Jimmy
Never seen this channel before, but seeing that I am from the Chicago suburbs as well, just got back from a trip there to visit family, just saw my first Margaritaville in Navy Pier (from the outside) and then my second in Minnezpolis when visiting other family, and am now safely at my home back in California....mmmm... the algorithm is clearly on to me.
River Spirit was owned by Jimmy?
So the next one you're doing is Bubba Gump right?
lovin these videos man WI here love the dells
as a (former) University of Arkansas student, every year thousands of students make the trek from Fayetteville to Arlington to watch the Razorbacks play the T&MU Aggies at Jerry World. Every year, we stop at the Buccee’s (we pronounce it Bussy’s) in Melissa, Texas, just north of Dallas on the way back home. There is not a feeling quite like walking into a 50,000 square foot gas station mall and being surrounded by people who are wallowing in the same despair pit as you after suffering a loss in a winnable football game. Anyways, moral of the story: Bussy’s is a sacred place. It provides much comfort and reassurance into the hearts of men. Truly a blessing from whatever deity watches over us. It is proof of a loving God.
Hahahaha, this is funny since I just realized I was accidentally doing this as a joke while traveling the country with my dog.
Ok, I had to pause & comment right now, because feet are obviously a thing for Eddy, & I don’t know if channel owners get to see the advertisement videos that are played during their actual content, but this one right at 20:40 is all about feet! 🫣
Alright, now do Cracker Barell.
Nothing like diarrhea to make one self reflect.
Ok so hear me out.  Great Wolf Lodge. There are 22 (soon to be 23) locations, all with an in house restaurant, and you stay a night in each one, go in the water park and move on to the next one.
Rip Jimmy Buffet
At 37:48 you can see clearly a dirty backpack on the bed, close to the pillow. Hygene first.
5:29 IS THAT NAKEYJAKEY???
What about the Margaritaville in Shreveport, Louisiana?  Did I miss it in the video?
16:23 the comedic timing of everything
OK Bourdain
so whats the trip for 2024??? better be medieval times
The disappointment I felt when I barely found out about this is immeasurable.
Among all of the questions I have about this trip, the biggest is this: Who rents a pickup truck for a road trip?? Why would you want your stuff in a truck bed when you could just get a closed-cab SUV or something???
I have watched this video so much. Same with the Rainforest Cafe  one. The rewatchabiliyy is ABSURD.  Edit: It’s been 2 months since I first found this vid. Watched it 25 times so far. I love it. Edit: 30
you know jimmy's dead
Eddie is a dirtbag for that Canada click bait in the title. I came into this expecting an America-centric road trip
Am i crazy or did i miss the Lake of the Ozarks location in Missouri? 🤨
What's the difference between Margaritaville and Cheeseburger in Paradise? A liquor license?
HOLY SHIT TIM MISNY APPEARANCE
No Boston?
I bet YOU. I WILL BEAT YOU AT STINKY FEET 100%. ANYTIME !!!  I’ve played and won at every water shooting game I’ve ever played !!  I win nothing ejse in life. SOOOO Give this to me .. FFS 🤭 ❤️❤️🇨🇦
They have them in Canada. Whhhhaaaattt
The pronunciation of Biloxi kills me
Ted is the Dorian Gray to Eddie's portrait of him  Margaritaville has claimed Eddie and is giving all his vitality to Ted
Hardrock caffee next, wordwide pls
can’t wait for hard rock cafe in 7 months
I ate at the one at Ft. Lauderdale airport and I threw up all over the plane 😢
next needs to be hard rock cafe in the US AND CANADA :D
When you doing every bubba gump shrimp location.
this is what im watching for new years. thank you
Theres a  Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio next to cold creek
Wait why do I agree that Jimmy is actually strikingly handsome and charming
40:34 *was
12:08 a thump that was heard around the world 💀💀
My man went full salt life.
Watched this over 2 years
grown man pretends that traveling the country and eating at a restaurant is torture
Happy New Year to my favourite YouTube video of all time ❤️
Gotta have a cheese burger somewhere.
I feel like maybe he should have also had a restaurant called jimmy’s buffet.
Margaritaville at sea
This was an epic documentary, Eddy!!!
Pls do another one
What about the one in Shreveport, Louisiana?
47:58 danny looks like he was on the verge of tears 😭
My father's name is Binkley. He is a good man but only has one eye. Everyone calls him Blinky Binkley 👁️
Do they put Jimmy jams on the ice cream?
Great. Now, do Hard Rock.
Next: going to every six flags in the country, Jk Jk...... or am I ?
Can u do it again
Jimmy died because of this video...
i thought margaritaville was just from that south park epsiode, the more you know i guess
Wait, isn't there one in Palm Springs?
Today I just found out that where in californa Universal studios margivretavile, I was IN THE SAME Mall ONE store over. I thought I saw Ted but just kept walking with my family as I d8dnt think it was him. When i made it back home, I was over looking pictures that I took and EDDY AND TED was in the BACKROUND OF MY PHOTO. So technically I did get a photo with yall. 😃🫶
You could just get a Corona man...
This video makes me exited to become a margarita enthusiast. Or an alcoholic
36:54 are we gonna gloss over the fact ted got a "the thing?" shirt
Alright guys, which chain restaurant are they going to pick this summer
I always figured margaritaville wasn't a place you wanted to be in
He's wasting away in margaritaville
Lol just going to point out that this didn’t include the Palm Springs resort…
9:53 that alien hung AF
fat
You didnt go to everyone. Bossier City in Louisiana has one
these guys choose a pick up truck to go on a 9k mile road trip? definitely from california lol. extra dumb because the only thing they put in the bed is their unprotected luggage.
The suffering... Truly the Werner Herzog of our time (apart from the man himself).
You should go international and do every Blue Man Group show lol
Goodbye Jimmy!
See y'all next year at Bubba Gump's
54:49 the cinematography
48:29 this might be weezer
Hard. Rock. Cafe.
How much weight did you gain from this trip?😂
very much enjoyed this video (besides my hatred of anish kapoor and by extension his awful bean) but how did you pick margaritaville as ur road trip focus? rfc was cuz of ted's love
Time to go to ever Bubba Gump shrimp in the country
Can't wait till next year when you go to all Hard Rocks.
Eddy forgot to go to the Margaritaville Cruise.... So he technically didn't go to all the Margaritaville, yet.
Eddie has the perfect confused and scared house cat expression on that dr seuss ride
The Thing top! 😂❤
Why would you rent a pickup truck for a road trip for 2 people and some luggage?
american car culture is needing a 4 door truck to drive on the highway and only on the highway
What's sadder - a full nation wide tour of a corporatised resturant or the fact I watched the entire thing and smiled more than 60 times.
14:17
The fact that Eddy has three-day growth through the entire trip kinda freaks me out. Very enjoyable to watch otherwise!
This video is just "let me document my dad lore" how did I only just find Eddy
Bill Lux eee
Sooooo next you're gonna do every Bubba Gump Shrimp location, right?
Fun Fact: My grandma met her boyfriend at the Myrtle Beach Margaritavile
Who asked for this? I mean, seriously? It was freaking fantastic, and I loved it, but still 😂not
if only you listened to every Jimmy Buffet album on the road lol
"The day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea" 💀 fucking hell, i was not prepared for that 😂
America cant be real
Hear me out…. You guys go to every medical times in the country and Canada… THERES ONLY TEN
2024: Hard Rock Cafe
I can't help but notice  you skipped the Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville's CRUISE SHIP...so I say nope, not done yet....one more to go
Jimmy Buffett fandom is definitely a cult. I was with my brother in law and his dad at a bar the day he died and they were both super distraught. Mind you these were the macho type "anti snowflake" kind of people and they were so depressed the whole night they would not stop ordering margaritas and singing his songs in his honor. Never got it
Can you go to every single Ripleys Believe or Not museum in America?
Can you go to every single Ripleys Believe or Not museum in America?
Can you go to every single Ripleys Believe or Not museum in America?
I love how he says “decided to go to” like he has a choice
Eat some vegetables.
Who knew Jimmy Buffet later DIED on September 1st, 1 month and 11 Days after this video was published
Neat.
Thank GOD I finally know what "The Thing..?" is. I've seen those signs plastered for 200 miles over the I10 and never once actually visited it.
I hope you find something to keep for yourself among everything you share on the internet
Help your local community
Oh brother get ready because another is going to pop up in the recently hurricane-devastated Fort Myers Beach near me
bro irl randy marsh
hard rock cafe? or bucees next
its pronounced biluxi not biloxi
The caribbean margaritavilles are way, WAY cooler. Pools, water slides, huge floaties out in the ocean that you can jump around on. I was part of a scuba club in high school and every trip we would stop at a margaritaville (and listen to jimmy buffet nonstop because the biology teacher who ran the club was OBSESSED!)   I live by the mall of america one and it’s just such a disappointment 😢
Jimmy Buffett can be fun but the fans can be the most insufferable boomers
45:07 - No.
You know it's a good idea for an hour long video when a significant amount of the runtime is dedicated to roadside attractions and other things not related to Margaritavilles
You didnt visit the puerto rico one !!!
51:45 I am so sorry but that Jambalaya is the most Dollarama looking ass Jambalaya I have ever seen. The Caijun is more missing than a kid being told by their dad that they are heading to 7-11 for milk
Now do the Hard Rock Cafe...
I didn't see the Margaritaville in Palm springs, Eddie.  What about palm springs, Eddie?! Did you forget the hotel  and restaurant in Palm Springs, Eddie?! Is the inland empire a joke to you, Eddie?!
08:32 Thank you, Eddy, for answering what is "The Thing". A question i have had my whole life as someone who has lived in the area my whole life. But was too lazy to ever google or go to.
Ted is my kind of guy. His spirit can never be broken!
I love how everyone wants him to go suffer at Hard Rock Cafe. I agree.
If you think about it, the cat in the hat IRL would be terrifying lol just as or worst of the ride lol
Plot twist the 4 year old kid is actually Ted. At 16:34 it says winner and loser on the lights above the game. lol good try bro. Still love the video. 😂😂👏👏👏
it’s been years since I’ve lived in PCB but if I remember correctly there is an absolutely massive saltshaker dangling precariously from the ceiling threatening to crush half the patrons
Yeah, the Cat in the Hat ride scares me and I'm practically an adult.
Rest in Peace to the legendary Jimmy Buffett
Any chance you could visit every Trump hotel?
Okay but the Margaritas on the collar of the shirt look SO fly 🍹
Go to every Joe's Crab Shack next
They should go to the one in Santa Cruz. It’s not a licensed one but it would be funny
Do every Dicks Last Resort
I love buccee :)
Puddle next to your table a thing?
ted enjoys margaritaville so much that that margarita's he's drinking is water.
When you going to every medieval times in the US? There's only 10 scattered across the US, how could that go wrong?
next will be hard rock cafe
everyone is invited to Eddy and Jimmy's wedding
As someone not from the US can someone please explain whats up with spencers?
Oh hey I was in Destin summer 2022 and the Margariatville was uh.... yeah. It sure was!
There is now a Margaritaville cruise your welcome for that information
They're doing planet hollywood next year, book it
There’s a Margaritaville in Conroe TX that he skipped!
I love the mall of America. I go there whenever I’m at home in Minneapolis with my partner. We just fuck around, eat, and buy stuff. Over Thxgiving we saw FNAF there. I’ve never been to the Margaritaville but provided it’s open still next summer maybe I can cajole my family into taking me. I went to Rainforest Cafe when I lived in San Francisco (they had one there circa 2010) but again provided it’s still open I’ll see if I can make a date to go there sometime. Just to celebrate capitalism a lil bit lol.
I love sequels.
"they did not have to do that but if they didn't... And if they did..."
Up next: McDonalds!
My sister in law got engaged at the margaritaville in destin FL
I just finished watching this and I have no idea why I watched it but it was enjoyable
There’s one in Sandusky OH.
I did get the same feeling watching this as I've gotten from watching certain Salvador Dalí films.
I live by MOA, that rain Forrest cafe is awful
cheesecake facorty
Can’t wait for the Hard Rock Cafe video!
I watched this video this morning and now I'm eating lunch at the Miami Margaritaville for you. WWJD (What Would Jimmy Do?)
I watched this video while Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix installed on my computer, between 11:20 to 43:32 .
Lmao 10:00 can confirm us Binkleys are NOT to be trusted 😂😂
You skipped the Margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach...
I like that, the LED margarita glass is the Las Vegas sphere, crawling into his mind.
can't wait for next years video, when eddy and ted are going to eat at EVERY BUBBA GUMPS SHRIMP CO. in the US. (23)!!!
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co is waiting in the wings.
me, seeing the bucees i used to work at featured in a video with 6.7m views: wtf eddy was in my town and i didn't get to say hi? :(
Lol you think you're the only ones who have done that? RiP
next challenge. all 667 cracker barrel locations
The one in Jamaica has a waterslide that goes over the bar
35:59 It feels weird seeing the sights and  locations I usually see when I'm going on a trip to the Smokey Mountains. 😄
Margaritaville is just an overplayed and overrated song.  Not sure why people like it.
Maybe you should have Tums or Pepto Bismal sponser your next trip.😅
Some friends of mine went to the Margaritaville Hotel and Resort in Pigeon Forge,Tennessee for their honeymoon. 😄
His stare of those rainforest cafe is priceless 😂
Seeing eddy go crazy slowly and ted cilling out slowly is the best part of each video
Just love it. All of it I guess, but the narration takes it over the top for me. The getting didtracted by the “thing” sign and the alien rock hard butt. Good stuff.  PS. I’m an old man, but I love seeing your generation doing such amazing things like these videos you do.
Jimmy really said “My life is complete two YouTubers went to all my restaurants and now I may pass.”
You should go to every Bubba gunp shrimp.
good ol baytown buc-ee's.
I suspect Jimmy's drinks are like Boston Pizza in Canada-no bartender, too sweet, fake flavour. I didn't get far through the Cat in th Hat movie, I hope the ride was way better! HS Jimmy had a flying boat! That spinning hurricaine is fugly! They gave you something after hours-kudos to staff! I'd like to go to Gatlinburg1
How did I know the Syracuse location was gonna suck lol that place is always a ghost town
Starting off right with a nice big liquid lunch!
Tasting away in Margaraitavilles-but the Buffet is dead...That belching volcano got me. Stinky feet, just pissing on your feet-done that.
Now you have to go to all of Salt Bae’s restaurants
Medieval times next!!!
So each one has something different.  Also how much did the sponsor pay?
wasting away again in Margaritaville
I actually grew up near a water park that got bought and turned into a Margaritaville in the past several years. I actually visited home and was planning on going to it the day after he died (of course not expecting that to happen at all)! They had a memorial for him set up on the beach
complete the trilogy with Hard rock Cafe XD
Hooterz
you didn't go to the one at Lake Lanier
I am sixty-two years old and have been listening to Buffett since the early days. Growing up on the beach in Florida, my friends and I couldn't get enough of Buffett, and by the mid eighties, I had seen him in concert a couple of times. Both times, the shows were just ok and nothing to write home about, so I never went to another concert even though he toured our city every few years. From 1990-1995, I worked in Key West Florida, so of course, I beat a path to Margaritaville when I first arrived, and I do have to say the Burger was pretty good, but the service was horrible! I only went a few times after that, usually when friends would visit, and of course, they all wanted to hit Margaritaville first. Each time the service sucked and the last time I went into the Margaritaville in Key West, my friends and I got so tired of waiting to get served that we got up and left. I've been to two other Margaritavilles, and both of those establishments were ok on the service (hardly any customers),  so it's not hard to get service. The food was god-awful at those locations. I  think Jimmy Buffett was all about cashing in on his fame because without his name and popularity, those restaurants would have closed long ago. I can't imagine now that he has passed away that the restaurants across the country will remain open.
Your eyes look like a WW1 solider watching a shell barreling towards his trench for the fourth time this week.
Why? What did you do wrong?
Okay the Statue of Liberty holding an LED margarita is hilarious. 😂
54:09 this is the tyre shop from cars
Does anyone remember the thing in Arizona in the 2000s? It was not that fancy 😂
as a Texan your buc-ee's rep is on point
do hard rock cafe next
Being from sc the one in our state claims to be in Hilton Head island when its like legit an hour at least from there
Going to every bucees next year
If it makes y’all feel better about wasting 45 days of your life eating at Margaritaville, I just wasted an hour of my day watching you do it. And I loved every minute of it.
Final!!! Do Hooters Next!!! At least North America, but hey they got some in nice international destinations too. Hooter, Hooters, Hooters!
I've only been to the Margaritaville in *San Antonio*, but they got good margaritas lol
8876 Margaritaville Panama City Beach
25:28 i use to sell acid to that dude XD
I don’t know why I am watching this. But I can’t turn it off for some reason?
Eddy do every Cheesecake Factory!
medieval times might be a nice easier option for next year. only 10 locations in the us and canada and dinner and a show every night
What about Hard Rock?
Also Florida is extremely flat and geographically depressing other than the wildlife parks and beaches
He started performing in the late 60’s and had toured all throughout the 70’s too.
where can i get his yikes flower flag from his living room i need
Go to every Mcdonals
5:44 are those rm williams? if they are I'm surprised the yanks got hold of them
Missed the San Diego margaritaville……..
Hard Rock next
I hate watching other people live my dreams
as an ohioan thank you for including the misny sign <3
Heyyyy that’s funny, all the chicks like to call me deep eddy!!! Ha that’s funny.. lol
My man, you sealed your fate now. This whole gimmick must be done every year from now on.
Cartman would be proud of you, son
Haha dang I wish y’all hadn’t been so tired at the Hollywood Ft Lauderdale one, I love that place. We have a conference there annually and everyone enjoys it and the boardwalk. Great video!
46:32 Tim Misney Making Them Pay cameo!!!
I never in my life thought I'd laugh so hard at the phrase "So we arived in Tulsa" 😂🤣😂🤣
now you gotta go to a chuck e cheese in every state
Bro's collecting dad lore
Rip jimmy buffet
Next time do McDonald's!
This video made me love and hate America more at the same time.
Man, I really hope you get those shirts back in stock
You didn't go to Bossier City,LA
My dad loved Jimmy Buffett when I was a kid, and very much loved Key West. He also sort of looked like him from the 70's and had a boat called the Beer Can
what about the margaritraville in bossier 👀
this was such a funny video i cant wait for the next chain restaurant lol
Alternative title man gets brainwashed by Jimmy Buffett
Na i drove cross-country from los Angeles to Louisiana Alexandria to move to my new house and it sucks ass
I can't wait to see whats next
Portillos or are you not a Chicago suberbian
10:19 Justice for Charles Barkley! Is that woman in the pink top holding a churro, too?
Ummm there is definitely Margaritaville in Shreveport... you skipped that one..
I wonder what the next go to every restaurant video will be
I fell asleep to this, I’m so disappointed in myself I need to rewatch
"For the second and FINAL time."  *_laughs in Cheesecake Factory_*
cool idea, terrible personality
now do i ate at every mcdonalds in the usa
ok what worries me is, are they drink and driving?
10/10
The Tim Misny billboard was a nice touch
Eddy actually does these road trips recreationally, and only films them for tax reasons
R.I.P JIMMY
Ed and Ted are American heros 2 Tours in the worlds most mid restaurant chains
Bubba Gump’s next year? 😏
But did you find your lost shaker of salt?
You walked, so we can sit back and enjoy the show.  Thank you for visiting the better view of the falls, welcome, everuthing is weird here.
Red Robin or Dave and Busters is next mark my words  *edit: nevermind I just looked at both of their store numbers and that would be insane😂
So cheesy 🧀  id skip even one of these restaurants 😮😢
It's the booze and sugar.
You should do McDonalds next
Did this video kill Jimmy?
I wonder how much backlog footage this guy has. It would be insane if he travelled the country for every one of this series..
52:16
Bringing up concerns of a child getting lost in a buccees is probably the most Californian thing I’ve ever heard 😂 🤡
Boston local here: the Boston Margaritaville opened and it's famously awful. As in: people who like Margaritaville consider it to be far below the standards of quality they expect from a Margaritaville.
Are you the rainforest cafe guy???? I am invested what’s next????
Conroe Tx?
Visit every single McDonald, all over the world
Eddy you won't be a true man until you make Part 3: Eating at every McDonalds in the country
This was my first vid I’ve seen of yours and I love the editing style and commentary!
23:30 actually, Key West has been Conch Republic Territory for many years and is not a part of Florida.
I've watched 2 eddy burback videos and he's already the guy who told me the most lies!  USA AAAAAAAAAND CANADA???
Did you kill Jimmy
I got to meet an elderly couple who let  jimmy sleep in the back room,  play and sweep as he was getting his start. It was really cool. They had moved back to WNY but they were key west legend. As I was fixing their plumbing I got to see some awesome srap books. I am jaded by the parrot heads but it was really cool to hear the stories of  key west in the 70s. Jimmy was just a guy to them and there were stories upon stories. Jimmy was on the water at buds funeral. I did get to meet his manager and a couple of old friends  I saw the letter he wrote to dot on buds passing. Jimmy was a class act. I wish I was with them then.
Goodbye Jimmy
Dude no way, Ted nivison has a video about the same thing, I hope they meet up sometime
44:59 omg i also sat at that same table i can tell youre filming at and ate at the Syracuse restaurant and the food was so unbelievably disgusting LOL
He is slowing going insane farther into the video.
eddy, there is a new margaritaville in boston.....
49:35 the sidebar conversation about how the "vibes" justify the possible food poisoning 😂😂😂😂
I live across the lake from the conroe texas . Hilarious
Probably good that the Margaritaville in Waikiki closed before you guys planned all this out. Aloha!
His microphone is out of this world
Is the bit with the green M&M at 52:49 a reference to Blade Runner 2049?
They have a margaritaville in St Thomas and I'm sure there's one in Hawaii, probably Puerto Rico too. So not "all' in the US
I’m beyond disappointed that you drove past the Margaritaville Hotel in Palm Springs. You literally passed it going from LA to Phoenix.
no way you went into a dead coma on that ferris wheel; we have one where i live just like it and no matter how calm and relaxed you are you aint falling asleep on a ferris wheel thats going to let you off in TOPS ten minutes..... don't lie my guy  if you listen to best of jimmy buffett while watching this video it's free on youtube and goes perfect with your video but god forbid youre able to put it into your video because of dmca...... it makes no sense. next time you should have a suggested play list for a video like this
looks like them onion rangs at 4:58 are burnt my guy.....it might be the camera lighting but they don't look golden broon n dericious mate...
Man yall should’ve done casa bonita!!
I love the ptsd episode eddy has looking at a rainforest cafe
Now do McDonald's!!! 😂
I feel like this turned you into an alcoholic 😂
didnt even see that you posted this, angry that im late. RIP our beloved jimmy.
Do a Dick's Last Resort road trip
19:00 WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS UPLOADER
nothing makes me more sad than knowing I'll have to wait another year for the possibility of another sanity-ending road trip.
You do know there was a margarita ville in Connecticut
My next recommended video after this is Idiocracy
Jimmy Buffet haa integrity. He'd rather keel over than even entertain bribing Eddy for Magaritaville.
Please do the Hard Rock Cafe next please do it
We need to put Eddy's videos in a time capsule
eddy i think i saw u at a bar in the chicago burbs 💀💀
I saw the Glee video and hoped there would be more but dont see any.  If you haven't watched Riverdale please do so.  Its so much more dumb/inappropriate than Glee.
What a mustache.
As a kid went to the one in Vegas and soled those mid-ass nachos lol
I also self reflect when I have diarrhoea  don’t worry Ted
Margaritaville in Vegas actually has bomb breakfast and is one of the cheapest places to get it there
Restaurants close at 9pm 5 days a week... surely these restaurants are just a cover for laundering money or some other scam.
As a Texan myself, buccees is a staple of our great state
Love your guys' storytelling in these videos
I didn't know New Orleans was in Louisiana. I always assumed it was a Florida thing
Thanks to this video I now chant "Boat, boat, boat, boat" to myself randomly
There’s a new one in Boston and it’s NOT great. Check it out!
the fact that you actually stopped for The Thing 🤣
Props for the editing on this one. Keeps my attention better than it should for an hour long trek.
FINE! I'll click on it! Just get out of my recommended!
maybe margarita ville were the friends we made along the way
Now you gotta do cheesecake factory 😂
Do the Hard Rock Cafe next year
IM SO HAPPY SOMEONE ALSO THINKS ITS A HORROR SHOW 30:40
as someone who lives in syracuse, i genuinely have no idea how the one in destiny usa stays in business, it is literally deserted every time i walk past it 💀
The Vibes
Surely Hard Rock cafe next??
As someone who's mom is obsessed with Margaritaville i have been to most of these in my 23 years of life and it's just weird seeing it in video lmfao
So where doing this again
loved the use of Vivaldi winter!!!!
About ten minutes in I realized this is the video equivalent of looking at your aunt's vacation photos. The existential dread of wasting my time with this pointless bullshit means I can't finish it, but good job regardless!
mojo bones <3
Good job, now go to every Medieval Times or I'm summoning Jimmy's ghost to haunt you.
Go to every McDonalds in the US for your 10M subscriber special
To conclude the trilogy, y’all should go to every single Chuck E. Cheese. 😂
eddys so cute im uwuing
As a GA resident, it cracks me up that practically the only place they got stuck in traffic across both videos was Atlanta.  BECAUSE OF COURSE IT WAS.
Rest in peace jimmy
this feels like the plot of midsommar where at first they’re like “this is crazy” but then they get indoctrinated 😭
Bro you’re not wrong Stinky Feet is technically a globaly known game because I’m Canadian and I love it
So   So          Sorry
How many margaritavilles are within 1 mile of a Ferris wheel?
So Bubba Gump next year?
53:00 😂
Aw, Atlanta sucks tbh we have the worst customer service on earth and awful customers. That manager was probably just ready to go 😭
You skip Sandusky Ohio pissed off I watch this video
Vote for every mcdonalds
Cannot wait for the house of blues video
You should try all the sugar factory locations next
Ted is not having a good time this trip lol
The margaritavilles were jimmys horcruxes
Those prices are crazzyyy for mid tier food at best
45:07 🇨🇦
Weird, I'm getting similar video suggestions for this video now that I'm finally here after seeing this in my recommendations for so long, but I never knew that beforehand. :p
do hard rock next year
You guys should go to every bubba gimp shrimp Co location
So Cheese Cake Factory when?
YOU SKIPPED JACKSONVILLE EDDIE NOOO
You should go to every Great Wolf Lodge in America. I think there’s like 17 of them !
Don’t buy the shirt. It will never arrive and this dude will scam you. 70 bucks down the drain!
Now it’s time for Hard Rock Cafe…..  you must do it!  It’s time to rock on!!
Pigeon forge is so awesome u should go back and be a tourist sometimes
You did not just call Biloxi "BOlOxie"
36:54 appreciate the Thing t shirt
5:30 TED
Fun video but it ultimately made me sad. I grew up with Jimmy Buffet's actual albums, and it saddens me that he chose to parlay his two cheesiest songs into this weird corporate chain experience, because that will become all he is known for. He actually was a gifted songwriter and many of his songs are lovely and sincere, Like Son of a Son of a Sailor or Come Monday. I have happy memories of traveling through Colorado and California with my mom listening to his records. Oh well, that's what capitalism does I guess.
Heck no! Those prices with that quality and portion size. Horrible restaurant. I guess you'd go for the drinks though lol.
Forgot there was a Margaritaville in my city until this video
as a canadian im so proud of how awesome our Margaritaville and rainforest cafe are
you're telling me this man built an entire empire around the food and beverage industry, last name is even BUFFETT, and yet... no Jimmy Buffett Buffett's :(
I like the hat, i got a flask myself, but now i feel like i missed out. Lol. 😂
cant wait for the third aprt, going to all the hard rock cafes. at this point they gotta lol
Try to find a non=scam gastro doctor man. You shouldn't be having trouble like that. First the cod sandwiches, now this.
i went to florida recently and our hotel thing was 5 minutes from a bucees and i went in with my 8 y/o niece and the entire time i was replaying “a child could easily get lost” and we made it
eddy what did you do eddie oh my god
a twelth of your year thats like 0.083 of your year thats nothing baby girl
Do Hard Rock Cafe next.
So the food fucking sucks, eh? Ain't that America.
next do mcdonalds
You didnt go to the margaritaville casino in bossier, louisiana. Video needs an addition
As a Key West local I'm glad you enjoyed your stay, it is jaw droppingly beautiful but like you ufound out unreasonably expensive as well. I actually never ate at that Margaritaville cause it sounds kinda lame to eat there instead of one of the thousand local restaraunts, but good to know it doesn't suck and made you feel like you were experiencing the Keys for what they are, I'll have to try it sometime.
NOW EVERY OLIVE GARDEN!
anyone else think Ted developed stockholm syndrome or something? XD
52:37 ITS THE PEPSI ORANGE STREAK ROLLER COASTER LETS GOOOO
They have good margaritas (I live by the one in San Antonio)
Make it a trilogy!!
eeeeey. PCB. My hometown. :D
if there were awards for youtube videos this would win best score. the vangelis keys were choice bro
GLAD TO KNOW WE WERE THE WORST
YALL WERE AT MY MALLL
Why are you not uploading.
Wooo-hoo  shoutout to El Paso !🎉❤
Nice. Next go to every McDonald's in the US and Canada.
I still dont really know who jimmy buffet is
I think Ted ended up with Stockholm syndrome.
Missed opportunity to have a jimmy and coke
why on earth would you rent a pickup truck for a cross country trip?!?!? Prius ftw.
so it's just a lower quality, but  more expensive Red Robin. Gotcha.
Goodbye jimmy 😔👋
Medieval times next! Please
Nosir. There’s 2 locations in Georgia. YOURE NOT DONE YET BUD
Seeing the pigeon forge one triggered memories 😂😂😂
i just found out he died 40 minutes into this video because i wanted to fact check the 30 albums thing and i am heartbroken
9:36 In that moment we saw the face of a man, caught after nearly 22 years.
Hard Rock Cafe is next
Bubba Gump when??
Now do every McDonald's
I'm a little late to the party, and my comments are probably not valued on this channel, but did you know that Rob Smith had ceviche at the cabana the other day with his friends and it was fun.
now go to every mcdonalds
South Floridian here, we hate Florida just as much as you do
You and Ted need to eat at the new one they just opened in San Diego to update this!
Except you didn't....  There's a margaritaville cruise ship.  Official branding.
Thank you so much for showing off Cleveland's treasure, the eyes of Tim Misny.  He will make you pay.
Wasting away, again...
JIMMY BUFFET IS DEAD
complete the unholy trifecta and go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country
This video as so wonderfully pointless! I loved every second of it :)
So outback steakhouse is next? Or are you upping the game and going global with the Hard rock Cafe?
Bubba Gump Shrimp next year!
I went to a single Margaritaville. It was in Jamaica. What boggles my mind about all these American Margaritavilles is the contrast between the ones that are outside of the country and the ones in the US is how different the tone is. In Jamaica, and all the others in the Carribean, there is a pool. You can drink a margarita and waste away in a lounge chair all day. You basically go there and find the same experience the song describes. The bar opens when the cruise ships come in, and close when the tourists leave.   Margaritaville isn't Hard Rock Cafe. It feels like they are trying to be though. It just doesn't make sense. Hard Rock Cafe is a place that specializes burgers around a collection of rock-and-roll memorabilia. It works in any big 'hip' city. Margaritaville... not so much.
I would love to see every receipt they collected from this for the sake of wondering how much $ was spent to make this happen.
Next video, Every fridays. ROFL
I'm from Twin cities and was eagerly anticipating that part.  No one goes to the mall of hell to have a blast 🤣🤣🤣
I have one in my town and it's not great. I mean I've never went in it, but it looks like a old warehouse. Plus it's right next to a bunch of tax companies
I really hope Jimmy saw this before he died
Eddie looks like those mustache nosie glasses thing
26:55 Come to yuppie tourist joint, Key West, as part of a month-long road trip, to forget about... class disparity? Dude, you are so out of touch with reality
Eddie, please go to every Buc-ee’s in the US
The amount of amusement parks you must pass up is the worst part.
Watching a human go through this kind of self inflicted psychological torture TWICE is like watching a trainwreck. What if you did a third time and went to all the Hard Rock Cafes.
did you get any burbyback ribs?
So…when is the “I ate at every Planet Hollywood in the Country” coming out, we saw you hint at the next in the Regrettable Roadtrip in that final Las Vegas shot.
I can't believe I just spent an hour of my life watching a stranger eat at every Margaritaville in the US and Canada, but I did and it was great! I really enjoyed this, nice work!
I haven't even heard a single song from this guy, but I ate on one of his restaurants for the theming xD
49:50 'the day you had self reflection was the day you had diarrhea?' Yes, Eddy. Sometimes sitting on the toilet, you really have to contemplate and even reevaluate some parts of your life
"The day you have self reflection is the day you have diarrhea?" Best quote of this video
Rip jimmy
Wow. You are so so lucky to date such a beautiful human. Chrissy, you got yourself a catch. Eddy definitely is a stallion.
Isnt there a Margaritaville in Gatlinburg Tenn. right up the road from Pigeon Forge?
Turned your back on your friend..you’re actually pathetic
Every mc donalds, EVERYWHERE
Next should be watching every single hallmark Christmas movie ever made
I made the pilgrimage to the PCB location today in Pier Park on a family vacation. I pulled up the video to find out where you sat and saw our table was just across from the bar. I took a picture with the seat and my parents laughed as I said, “We are at a historical landmark.” Your video made the visit a more enjoyable experience, so thank you!
👏🏻
Man Beats A Child At Stinky Feet
damn, this feels like a tribute now
Ok the way you and your brother got all giggly when that guy said “coolest mofos on the planet” I died.
thats because ITS NOT FOR CLILDREN
Wait why did I fully think “Ted Nivison” was his joking clever YouTube way of modifying “television”… is that really his name? How stupid am I 💀
I love how every Margaritaville starts with “this Margaritaville was pretty standard except for (insert some insane piece of decor here)”
thanks for clearing up what 'The Thing' was. I was traveling down route 10 toward Wilcox, AZ and saw all the signs but being a pessimistic Yankee from Massachusetts, I didn't reeeaaalllly want to bother to stop.
The video thatkilled  Jimmy
47:11 greatest piece of cinema I’ve ever seen
34:12 its scary when a cryptid comes by but when you know where they are it's even scarier 😢
This aged well
We just skipping the lake of the ozarks location??
https://youtu.be/Mdgf-H-aUHg?si=VdwSUtfMzCIbL-gF
Legend has it Eddy will never make a video again due to the devastation from Jimmy's death.
I had no idea this was a chain
...AM I the only one watching this, wondering who the hecc Jimmy Buffet it is, and why he has his own series of restaurants seeming themed after him?
I would like to see how much this entire trip costed. 💵
Green MnM gl*ryhole?
Here before they go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country and Canada
now do every mcdonalds
now go to every McDonalds in the us
your narration reminds me of the Muppet Christmas carol
I’d really love if they went to every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the USA
Bubba Gump Shrimp should be next
Looking forward to the Hard Rock Road Trip video
Visit every Bubba Gump Shrimp!!
What about margaritaville at sea?
I have always loved gow teddy&eddy started their videos of in the same way as they did the rainforest cafè ones. Such a small detail but such a big [positive] reactoin in my brain chemical soup.
37:36 its honestly really cool to see this fucking dude wander around places ive been on marching band trips,,, for example 2 years ago I pretended to play music right in front of the skyfly building bc I didn’t remember any notes on the song we were playing
I was at Margaritaville the night Jimmy Buffet died 😢😢😢
What is margherita ville?
i like to imagine jimmy watched this, smiled contently, and then promptly died
Can’t wait till the 2024 Cheesecake factory marathon.
Go to google maps and look at the spread for Hard Rock Cafe and Medieval Times. Both would make pretty good videos...
Hey do Bubba Gump next
rip jimmy buffet i love this tribute keep up the good work man
R.I.P Jimmy Buffet 🙏🙏🙏
The Margaritaville in Orlando is actually in Kissimmee.
God I forgot about The Thing. Thank you for reminding me about “what if Dinosaur Laser Fight was real.”
The Atlantic City location burned down today :-(
Bubba Gump or Hard Rock has to be next
TO THE HARDROCK CAFE!!!!
As someone from Mississippi….THE BILOXI PRONUNCIATION KILLED ME
While I value your sanity...and I guess Teds...I do believe your journey isn't over. There's definitely some Bubba Gum Shrimp Co. and Hard Rock Cafe restaurants that require your attention...
I was stationed in El Paso it's the ass crack of Texas
There are 35 Hard Rock Cafes in the U.S. and Canada. I'm happy to sit on my couch and watch that journey 😂😂
eddy is free
10:59 🙏
I believe you must go to all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. I believe you would have a grand time and the aesthetics are right up your alley.
Went to the one in Nashville, waited *two hours* just for them get it wrong *several* times and the bill was over a hundred dollars after having to talk to the manager and then to the one who was head person, as the waitress didn’t even bother asking for our drinks and wouldn’t even check in that I had do physically call out for an employee because our food kept get wrong. It was raw or ice cold smh
the “final” eating at every somewhere… now do bucees.
okay but chrissy and eddy are both so beautiful, literally the cutest couple ever.
you killed jimmy buffet.
🔫👀 Now for 2024 do Bubba Gumps.
You make such fun videos eddy!
Love your videos Eddy!
Such a good video!
Go to every bubba gump
It’s pronounce bi luh xsee
Final time my ass, what kinda YouTuber would throw away a guaranteed 5mil+ views lol
The only Margueritaville I’ve been to is in Syracuse. Wasn’t so bad. But then I haven’t been to every other one.
I avtually love the whole shtick about margaritaville, and I'm Irish and have never been to the states! Just having a good time and drinking margaritas hell yeah haha
bro doesnt know the margaritaville secret (only ever get a plate of nachos for the table)
Love that you guys did this before he died and not even that long before, RIP Jimmy
What about the one in Bossier City?
I am currently in a rainforest cafe that's playing an instrumental of Margaritaville.
I spotted you at Camp Flog Gnaw, but didn’t want to walk up to you and say that I love you because I was not subscribed. I am now though lol    P.s. did you notice Jaden smith dancing behind you?
So you’ve done The Rainforest and Margaritaville, will you both do the Hard Rock Cafe’s of the USA next?
So to ruin your life and ruin any love of Tom Hanks. Bubba Gump. 23 locations. Game on. I'm moderately sorry. I love you.
Eddy saying "goodbye Jimmy" feels kind of ominous in retrospect
Now go to every bubba gump shrimp place
Can't wait for  Every Hard Rock cafe in the US and Mexico
Audible "yay!" When I saw drew!
This was beautiful. I enjoyed every minute of your descent into madness. Your storytelling and editing was flawless and I laughed through the whole video. Thank you. If you’re interested in torturing yourself further—have you thought about visiting all the Hard Rock Cafes?
thats the trials of derpulies theme
2 months later Jimmy buffet dies
OMG the margaritaville in CLE is cray. I live ten mins from there and go down there all the time. not the mizny poster lol
You guys should go to every single McDonald's next
The emphasis Eddy puts on the word 'Final' in final roadtrip means that there is 100% chance of a third roadtrip coming next year when they visit all 165 Hardrock Cafes in the world
RANDOM SCHLATT EVENT RANDOM SCHLATT EVENT
12:11  28:33 50:22 54:57
Does anyone know the main orchestral background music he uses? I want to know the name and see if I can play it on viola. It sounds so cool
My favorite band, Beezer.
World wide Hard Rock Cafe tour when?
Chop chop Eddy Hard Rock Cafe time
I hope the Atlanta staff saw this video. They need to hear the gratitude they deserved
"I beat the child" What a line
I finally understand why it’s so “hard” to be a YouTuber
I love the thought of Eddy seeing how well this video did and sweating like "oh god, is this my thing now? Am I Keith from Try Guys but for road trips??"
You need psyllium
47:12 this moment just brought me so much pure joy for some reason and i’m truly just writing this so that i can come back to it in the future
As a Mississippian, that pronunciation of Biloxi was criminal
Kinda sounds like future trunks
You guys should go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the States!!!😂
They should go to every single Hard Rock Cafe next
This was art thank you.
I don't need Jimmy to make me forget about wars, I have my house. Over there with those Israelis and Palestinians, apparently they're fighting, but as Jimmy once said: "Who cares." Fuckers been fighting since Pangaea.
Bubba Gump shrimp next
Do Hard Rock Cafe for a rockin time
i dare you to eat at every cheesecake factory. *you wont do it no balls.*
There were 3 in Biloxi, the site you were at was a victim of the 2008 financial crisis, they had broken ground, installed the mechanical room and laid vacant for a while, he opened a small casino on the back bay, which you showed a picture, but state laws changed and required a hotel on the casino grounds, the land owners refused to let him build so he returned to the original site.
Go to every Macdonalds next
Jimmy Buffet is a VERY distant cousin of mine. We’re both from the same general region (coastal Mississippi). I’ve never met him but I know some people who have (we also went to the same university, USM). I’ve heard both that he was a great guy and that he was an asshole. I have no idea which is accurate
if you want to eat the best mexican food on earth imo, check out Taqueria La Juanita in Storm Lake, Iowa. There is in Souix City but Storm Lakes the best.
As someone who stops at that Buc-ee’s regularly, I’m absolutely delighted to inform you that they’re currently building an even BIGGER one directly beside the one you stopped at.
"I don't know how Jimmy does this. I don't know how he can sustain this lifestyle." Well, Eddy...
The “The Thing” museum is why we can’t have nice things….😂
9:57 "I'm not listening to _anyone_ named Binkley."  Me, self-named Bingles/Bingo: "They had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
i feel like the margaritavilles would be the best part of the trip, just driving kinda sucks
32:25 ❤ as my heart lit up once again cuz I heard SC
hrmm...every Spaghetti Factor in America?
❤❤❤❤❤❤ DO IT FOR JIMMY
Next video: I ate at every McDonald's in the country
cant wait till they go to every hard rock cafe
RIP King
That guy who called you and your brother out on the streets of chicago was absolutely hilarious. Im so glad you left that in.
RIP Jimmy
Big Oof on the timing of the video but at the same time, it’s like they were pre-honoring Jimmy? Love the video! Keep it up, guys!
Soooooo where's the Palm Springs one?
Can you guys do bubba gump restaurants next?
okay next year do "I ate at every Cheesecake Factory"
I had no idea there was a gas station called Buc-cees… I was only familiar with the green and blue themed Buckeys 😮
hi deep eddy. im enjoying your videos 👍🏻 goodbye
nah this jimmy dude fr has a cult or something
Next they should do all the Great Wolf Lodges
Final time? big words there bud, i'll see you in the next video
I was going to skip through the sponsor part but then I saw the interest rates and had to watch the whole thing. I work at a credit union so the banking terms sucked me in 😭
Rip jimmy, we love you
I ordered a shirt months ago and haven't received it yet 😢. Keep making content, and I'll keep watching. Just don't advertise the merch you don't have. You have to admit...that's pretty deceptive.
omfg this is my first time watching one of these types of your videos Eddy, as in a long-distance travel vlog. I was thinking "hm, I'd kinda like to do that, but I have a 2001 Toyota Tacoma" I almost died when you showed the footage of Ted's truck lmao!! No long distance for me (':
7:32 what are you talking about i dont see anything in the trunk
Good job Eddy now... go eat at every IHOP
Why is San Antonio so beautiful, I thought Texas was just one big barn and an even bigger steakhouse
I dare you to go to every mcdonalds next.
Now do mcdonalds
Now for hard rock cafe lol
I am absolutely Drew
The Boston Margaritaville is now open! You’re not finished!!!
Next do McDonalds
as a local, the way he said "Biloxi" hurt my ears a bit🤣
love the MCU - Margaritaville Cinematic Universe
RIP Himmy Buffet
Me gusta el jamon con queso muchas gracias 😊
Showing the Tim Minzy billboard in Cleveland and literally nothing else is just 👌
RIP to the King of Summer
RIP the buff man
I used to work at the river spirit casino in Tulsa what a trip lmao
I went to Florida when I was younger and instantly fell in love with it causing a greater love for Jimmy Buffett  this video hits home for me
very glad im not the only legal adult who gets absolutely terrified by the Cat in the Hat ride at Universal.
Missed the Margaritaville in Buford, GA. It's on Lake Lanier
You guys went to my hometown... while I'm not there???
20:21 Yeaaaah about the rain... I’m from Florida and I have never seen SO MUCH RAIN in a damn year as we did in 2023! My neighborhood flooded 3 times, one time was in the news because it shut down our airport for like 2 days and they closed schools the day after. It was epic to say the least.
@49:51 I have never laughed so loud during the video.
Okay but now you have to do every Buckees
The new one just opened in Boston MA, the one under construction, your journey isn't over yet Eddy!
Next you must visit every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
I hate to say that the missed the margaritaville where I’m from 😭 go back to Louisiana
Now the real kicker would be if y’all went to every Hard Rock Cafe lmao
You have a new subscriber 😂😂😂🩷🌍🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽 this is the best video I’ve ever seen! It’s random but so amazing!!
HARD ROCK CAFE C'MONNNN
Hard Rock Cafe next?
people not from the south pronounce it "Bil-UH-xi" instead of "Bi-LOX-i" challenge  (impossible)
Triggering YouTubers is so easy. Don't touch them or their whole emotional world will explode 😂    Their life story is similar to a Lyft driver or doordash married couple   They dropped out of high school or failed at the military.   They got fired at the local chicken plant or envelope stuffing back office and then was inspired by some dumbass YouTuber like Gary vee and thought I could start with my selfie stick and become a star😂.  While this channel is not total vomit like other channels. I can't give it a solid 2/10 stars either. I bet you still can't tell people in public what you do without feeling shame.  I guess if this doesn't work out you can tell people you're a tiktoker 😂.  Oops, I forgot you bruise easy.
You need to make this a trilogy. This is incredible lmao
I just love people doing many things against the bean creators vibes  Including calling it the bean.
Rip Jimmy buffet
46:25 my tummy hurts the day after I eat poutine too sometimes. You’re not alone, Eddy.
The one in Tulsa is the one I go to. I’m so glad that you enjoyed it.
Eddy and Ted eat at Casa Bonita plz
"the coolest motherf*ckers on the planet!" - some guy in chicago
i am concerned for both your and ted's sanities.   that being said, consider: every medieval times in the US (and one incanada)
Legend has it that Eddie has entered a 6 month hibernation to recover from this. During this hibernation, the food gods will tell him his next quest for visiting all the locations of.
Congratulations to Margaritaville in Tulsa Oklahoma for being one of the best Margaritaville in the country
the pixelated feet really cheered me up
Did you miss the one in Bossier City, Louisiana?
yah ted needed the room to "get some work done"
margarip
Two other spots that everyone would want you to do is every Medieval Times and every Hard Rock Cafe!!!❤❤❤❤❤
What about Hard Rock Cafe ?
The tummy ache was too real😞 thank you for doing gods work Ted🙏
Did that stinky feet game have a custom theme song playing or did I just imagine that?
I liked this video. I liked Jimmy. But $17.50 for that chicken sandwich is actually criminal …
Next, do every McDonald's in the US
I’ve seen this video 5 times. It’s a different adventure each time,  it’s so damn well made man.
Ok but still: I have no idea who Jimmy Buffett is.
Man, he didn’t mention that the one at myrtle beach has a hurricane storm that goes off.
Also they went to two on the largest malls. Mall of America is one and Destiny USA is like 3 or 4 I think
FUN FACT: The margaritaville in Syracuse has such terrible business that they owe like 4 million dollars 😂😂
Y'know, I was thinking that eating at the same restaurant 13 times in 14 days does sound awful. Then I realized that's exactly what I do with Starbucks food, because I work there and its free... so like, I would be dumb not to. But I hate it, and 13 times in 14 days still sounds awful. I just now know that I have reference to exactly how awful
rip to jimmy
Please go on the Margaritaville cruise
Now do Medieval Times. There's only 10 don't wimp out.
I jusy learned that Margaritaville is a restaurant 😂😂
Gotta go to all bubba gump locations!!!
He took his last breath while you were in one of his restaurants
next year I'm expecting McDonalds
holy shit eddy killed jimmy buffett
it's been three months which restaurant are you guys going to this time
We know you went to strip clubs on Bourbon street that's why you didn't film.
Planet Hollywood is next
I would live making this video vecause i love fried chain food and have no problem eating the same thing for weeks
I wonder if both are still covering
Coming from someone who’s lived in Washington state my whole life, that rain did look crazy. The windshield wipers being all the way on and it still being barely visible was wild.
now do every McDonald's
So, no Bubba Gump?
there is also at least one norweigan cruise ship that contains a margaritaville
omg pls do a trip to dollywood!!
Go to every hard rock cafe
5:31 He's not watching this
People are saying to go to Hard Rock Cafe, but what about Cheesecake Factory? Are those still even around anymore?
Will you go the Boston location to complete the mission?
Destiny USA doesn’t surprise me. Someone gets shot there every week lol.
Im sorry
i hate amerika so much right now XD
Like a Wikipedia scoundrel, I have come back just to say "was" for every "is".
you killed him
I counted and the word Margaritaville was said 105 times
26:33 FEET
it's about time you give islands a go!
This is some low effort content.
the way i lived in destin and panama city beach for 4 years but didn’t know there was a margaritaville in either of them
Next year go to all the bubba gumps in the us!
Rip to the beach king himself, only died a few months after this video 🫡
Gotta have a huge arcade to keep the kids busy while the parents are gambling away their college savings
Just some suggestions for the next restaurant road trip - Bubba Gump / 22 locations, Medieval Times / 10 locations, Guy Fieri restaurants / 17 locations
Wait, hold the fuck up, you can just drive to all those islands off the coast of Florida?? How have I lived in America for 24 years, and no one has ever told me about the Florida keys, other than just "this is a place that exists"?
Thank you for keeping me entertained and distracted while I stab myself to inject my meds
Wait but you skipped the Sandusky, OH location?
That skunk is named frank, he’s a Niagara Falls local
Y’know…    WHAT IF? Ted is an alien just messing with Eddy
As a 33-year-old who has never had an alcoholic beverage, was it ok to drink 1+ margarita every day amd still drive to the next city? I honestly have no idea
Okay I’m not blaming these guys for jimmy buffets passing. But I will say it’s a crazy coincidence that he dies after one person eats in all the margaritaville locations.   I think that was the thing that did jimmy in.  #ripjimmybuffet
For the next big trip, why don't you hit every McDonalds. It would take a year and probably kill you...but think of the views!
RIP Jimmy.
Comments caused me to do the math; in terms of gimmick restaurants Medieval Times wold be short but mostly a lost cause since that just covers the same areas as Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe, while Hard Rock Cafe would be the first chance to visit the Pacific Northwest since it has a Washington location, and Bubba Gump Shrimp Company would be absolutely hellish but would take them through Colorado and Minnesota, places I assume they haven't been. Both of them have more than 20 locations, though, with Hard Rock at 27 and Bubba Gump at 22, so I wouldn't wish that on human beings. and places like Ruby's Diner, Johnny Rockets, Outback Steakhouse, and Cracker Barrel are, while still gimmick restaurants, just so high in number that you can't ever do them all.  Here's a dark horse candidate though: Hamburger Mary's, a chain of restaurants each themed after their local gay community, with 17 locations in California, Texas, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Ohio. Doable trip, small number of locations, got character, and apparently it's pseudo-local so the food might be varied!
Ed and Ted unknowingly went on a pilgrimage to destroy each of Jimmy Buffett's Horcruxes. Now that he's free, Jimmy can now establish that big ol' Margaritaville in the sky
My gf and i had one of our first dates at thr Margheritaville in niagra in canada
when I look you up on google it show you girlfriend and then it led me to bad website 😢 WHY😢😢
You and Ted should do every hard rock cafe in the US and Canada
I didn’t even know margaritaville was a fuckin thing. I thought it was so bum ass country song and that was it.
Accidentally pausing at 15:25 was a trip.
this guy looks like he hates trump
Y'all should go to every Hard Rock Cafe  in the US and Canada
❤"40 hours in 8 days" 😅😭🫡bro my momm would make us go 12 hours straight no sleep. I WISH she gave us time lol but ffs in a less than 2 week trip it was 16 hours of driving both ways... No sleep.   Yes shed pull over into like random parking lots for a couple hours but being the only "teen" /her husband basically.  I woukd stay up THE WHOLE TIME literally my heart pounding. Not like lil miss 100lb girl could do shit anyways sooo lol
Ok but can you get to all 568 Chuck E Cheese locations? They keep dropping like flys give it about 3 years and the number would be much more manageable
was in Florida when Jimmy died. Really close to PCB. me and the boys had to pay respects and eat at Margaritaville.
48:30 if the boys were Weezer this would be one of their album covers
Many people are asking for you to do another trip like this for Hard Rock Cafe. But I'D love to one for Bubba Gump Shrimp.
Actual huli huli chicken is so good
10:30 "i met up with my friend schlatt" is pretty funny after going to a museum that talks about his adventures
So what we've learned from your two trips are: Canada's food tastes better Ted eventually embraces the chaos that is repeat meals Friends make meals feel better Always spin hug Danny
Rip thick James
On day fourteen, I was reminded of the two weeks I spent in the hospital for lung surgery, and it reminded me how much I hate traveling.
Bucees is my LIFE. Try the club melt sandwitch next time you go. It's my personal reccomendation.
It must be nervewracking to start the journey by going to the very first location.
R.I.P Jimmy Buffet 😢
Jimmy buffet saw this, realized what he had created, and died of regret.
You two should do Margaritaville at sea. It's a cruise that is basically empty so it's definitely going to be an interesting video.
This is the most video of all time
This video unlocked a memory of the only time I've ever been to a Margaritaville. I know this story is entirely irrelevant to everyone else, but this feels like the one space that I can share this story.   In 5th grade, my girl scout troop took a trip to Chicago and had dinner at the Margaritaville after exploring the Navy Pier. Don't ask me whose idea it was to bring 15 ten-year-old girls to Margaritaville. On this same trip, my best friend at the time and I almost got lost in the biggest Macy's I've ever seen (it was 5 floors btw). Again, I know this story is irrelevant to everyone else, I just really felt the need to share
“Oh, shit, coolest motherfuckers on the planet!”  I freaking love Chicagoans.
Traffic stopped welcome to Atlanta
Eddy has been real quiet since Jimmy died
I don’t have time to watch a full length movie but I do have time to watch Eddy go to all the margarita villes and rainforest cafés
the cat in the hat ride has been my favourite since I was 8, the freaky animatronics make it so perfect
I wonder what the next trip will be
bro i thought u were lying saying jimmy buffets created maragaritavillw
part 3.... every cheesecake factory
please don't do this again
When is the Bubba Gump roadtrip?
you shouls totally visit every cheesecake factory restaurant. you'll even go to hawaii! (dont telk him there is over 100 restaurants total)
Next Up you both should try Every Bubba Gump's
west coast sunsets in Flordia are goated.
I love this video so much because my parents unironically love the margaritaville restaurants and we have been to 5 or 6 of the locations you visited so it was kind of like a little nostalgia trip throughout the video :)
Rainforest Cafe tests the mind while Margaritaville tests the body. Now we need something to test the soul
You should eat at every Mc Donald’s in the country next.
was gonna say go to every magic time machine but theirs only two locations left. fidnt realize how lucky i am to live near one
That dolphin you saw was an orca 😂
It should be a buffet...
That alien vs dinosaur museum is literally the premise of the Ninja Sex Party song Dinosaur Laser Fight.
24:39 the end of the link looks like someone spelled comedy wrong.
you skipped the one in Palm Springs
u r so fucking telepathic bc once i got to the point where u said ur heading to texas next i was like Pls stop a bucees bless u sir
i got stuck on the cat in the hat ride it was awful
The fish is raw and frozen
I know you said this was your last road trip, but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say you should do Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump shrimp next 🤣🤣
rip
Can't wait for this guy to gaslight himself into doing Bubba Gumps in 2024
Didn't go on the Margaritaville cruise. Doesn't count.
"I ate at every Margaritaville in North America/on the continent"
Hard rock or bubba gumps next?
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co...? 👀
My god he’s doing it again I wish I could be as strong as you are yet sadly I am a mere mortal
You're a legend for this one. A legend
looks like jimmy couldn't afford to bribe eddy and it was too much criticism for a 76 year-old multi millionaire singer songwriter (and restaurateur)  to take
I ain’t ever had to switch up on my team to save a face
As a European I can't really believe the cult surrounding this guy I've heard one or two times on a radio as a child.
Awwww. I was getting so excited for the Nashville one, but you didn’t go to the hotel. 😂😭 My husband and I stayed at the hotel in Nashville for our honeymoon and it was actually really neat.
Anyone else click on a link in a tinder profile?
Do every Dick’s Last Resort next!
We all new next year Eddy and Ted will go in another stupid road trip hitting all the hard rock cafes
i just finished the intro and i am horrified. i saw *gulp* d-d-danny g-g-g-g-gonzalez… 😣😣
imagine doing this but with mcdonalds....
37:56 those jugs are actually liquor stills
Time for Hard Rock Cafe. Answer the call, Solider
just went to the margaritaville in chicago this weekend and let me tell you the tummy ache is REAL
A fun little thing my brain does is assume he and Warren Buffett are the same.
Why can I smell the restaurant
was not expecting such an intense character arc
You should do Hard Rock Cafe next. There's only 33, you'll be fine.
How's the Keys of hell feel Margarita Boy?
jfc what is the margarita count in this video?!
do this with Bubba Gump next
Bro is doing the supersize me challenge annually
Gonna have to post soon to save face.
R.I.P Jimmy Buffett
I never got to to go to margaritaville before his passing, I feel like an asshole
All of the bama breezes, land shark bars and cheeseburgers in paradise. It’s only a matter of time
the way i got excited seeing a tim misny billboard.
Do every Hard Rock Cafe
I like how both videos have you go through some sort of breakdown
why is thumbnaiI man so sad ? what has happened ?
Incredible video and presentation. Just great
The concept of Margaritaville explode my little third world country brain
Why torture yourself after you hated the Rainforest Cafe trip so much!
Now do cracker barrel
crazy idea but what if you went to every mcdonalds in the united states and canada?
Oh my god I was so curious about what the “The Thing” was when I saw a bunch of billboards for it driving to Arizona. Glad to have that mystery solved!
You guys should do Bubba Gump Shrimp next!
Frick yeah Wisconsin Dells!!!!
The progression of the cult narrative in this is actually genuinely bona fide haunting
Can’t wait for next year, “going to every bubba gump shrimp co”
Jimmy’s ded
eddy, this was a masterpiece, thank you for sharing
The next logicial step is to eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the Country (and Canada)
I still can't believe that Eddy murdered Jimmy Buffett just because of these restaurants... I remember on stream when Eddy was joking around saying, "Someone should 'do something' about Jimmy". But, I didn't think he'd ACTUALLY do it...
As a non American, therefore not used to such long trips being normal, this seems like a hell trip. But it’s almost not about Margaritaville. But the friends we made along the way.  Kidding.  It’s so nice to hear eddy seeing fans out there and meeting friends and having a drink and some fun
If it's any consultation, the rainforest cafe in the mall of America is gone lol 😂
9:38 Ted looks pretty heckin guilty.
9:38 Ted looks pretty fuckin guilty.
Bubba Gump Next!!
How did I just watch a one hour video?
I don’t think Jimmy is watching this bro
I was actually laughing out loud throughout most of this video which earned me a couple of confused looks from my roommate. This was great. Well done.
I'm writing this from the margaritaville in tulsa. The incommunicado was pretty good. Its a margaritaville.
i would have sent that fish back at 11:40 dude wtf
This was fun. Now do all McDonald's in southern California. Entire country would be cruel and borderline impossible lol.
i think the only reason they took the rental truck instead of the 2002 tacoma was because eddy was afraid of falling through the hole in the floor
Love the fact that the Canada RFC and Margaritaville were both the best 🇨🇦
Do Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Co. next
Ted's video to pair with this on his own channel, "I Drove to Every Margartiaville in the USA" is funny when you think of the implication that that means Eddy didn't allow Ted to eat at any of these places, but instead made Ted drive him around and just wait in the car.
Now do every Chili's bitch
Gotta do Hard Rock next bruv
As always, stellar stuff... but from someone who has lived in Biloxi... it's  'Bil-UH-xi'🤣
Imagine that guy said coolest guys on the planet was stoned AF and thought they were Cheech and Chong lowks they did in that clip for a sec or am I just too stoned
i’m glad to see bring traumatized by the cat and the hat ride is a universal experience
Eddy thank you for the great adventure.
25:29 i love how happy the guy is seeing a parrot
I have an extreme obsession with margaritaville because of you and tedd and for my birthday I plan on going to the closest margaritaville to were I live and I'm going to get merchandise and a margaritaville cup (I might be loseing my mind.)
Now we need a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. tour of duty next.
yaaaay, do quaker steak and lube next!
Now visit every fudrockers
They're opening one in my town. See you in Lake Tahoe next year lol
Watching this 13:37 as I’m currently getting ready for bed with the bucces blanket I have been sleeping with for over a year by now.
Is anyone gonna tell him about the cruised Margaritaville has? Margaritaville at Sea's Paradise is the ship.
Now do this again but in less than 48 hours and you have to eat at each for at least 30 minutes
I live in Hollywood fl, if u wait till about 10pm u can sneak ur way onto the rooftop pool and get hammered. It’s pretty neat
Eddy must have had a HUGE case of the Mondays.
Huge props to the editor on the timing of the photo of Eddy getting on the Ferris wheel alone
‘Mentally, I have to be just like Jimmy’ well… that aged poorly
Wait “final roadtrip”??
“the day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea??? 🤨☝🏽” that line fuckin killed me 😭 49:51
Two word if you guys are ever to do this again: take probiotics
Can't believe Eddy ate so much Margaritaville that Jimmy died. Rest in peace legend
i was watching this video as i fell asleep and then dreamed i went to do karaoke and sing margaritaville
Give me a Jimmy burger
Quick note from a Mississippian! We pronounce it "buh-luck-see" (of course we do, right?) - it was so fun seeing you explore somewhere I'm deeply familiar with. I don't live on the coast, but I go down there every October for an old car enthusiast event called Cruisin' the Coast, and Jimmy and Margaritaville are both huge parts of that
Loved both road trip videos. That one Margaritaville was awesome for getting you all drinks and food after hours. I hope they got appropriate praise from their management.
As someone who is lives near Pigeon Forge and lived there for years, i still do not understand why we have a margaritaville. Now there is a margaritaville hotel in Gatlinburg, the town literally right next to Pigeon forge... Don't get me wrong, i do like walking around The Island, but it does not fit in with the vibe and themes of the town. Lol. Not to mention, the margaritaville hotel in Gatlinburg is fucking ugly as hell and just in the middle of everything.
I was given a question on an Academic team test this weekend in which Jimmy was the answer, mentioning that he had passed in September. Rest in Peace Jimmy you really brought a special kind of joy to the world❤❤
I didn’t realize this video was almost an hour long until the second margaritaville
these two videos should be packaged and nominated for a Pulitzer, they somehow manage to capture themes of classic Americana and friendship all while hitting perfect comedic beats. Well done Eddy 👏
Seeing Pigeon Forge (a place that I have been an innumerable amount of times) from the perspective of a YouTuber is a little surreal
Visit all the chucky cheeses
“Jimmy if you’re watching this” G he ain’t watching 😂
This killed Jimmy Buffet
Watch them attempt to visit all the hard rock cafes XD
I have watched this video and the Rainforest Cafe video several times. Thank you for doing this dumb road trip twice! You are such a good storyteller (which is a good part of why I keep watching) and the yalls dynamic is so funny and sweet. PLEASE DO ANOTHER ROADTRIP!! ❤ Y'all
Today i made it to Niagra Falls and ended up in the margaritaville there and i saw the buffalo chicken poutine on the menu and asked the bartender what his thoughts were and he mentioned your video and said you said the poutine was good i got it and it did not dissapoint. It made me so happy he had seen this video and i thought it was just funny
The bladerunner m&m scene was perfect
10/10 recommend dollywood and all of its adjacent locations. I went as a kid and I will never forget it XD
Entonces como quiero a mi amigo que se parece a ti,te quiero a ti❤❤❤😂😂🎉😢😮😅😅
Tengo un amigo que se parece a ti,pero no tiene bigote,🤨😀🥹🤩
It really bothers me that this guys last name is Burback and he has a twin. My last name is Bubeck and I also have a twin! It makes me feel like they were meant to be an alternate universe version of my sister and me but somehow they ended up here.
well this aged well
You killed Jimmy you monster
These videos feel like the antithesis to Keith habersburger’s “eat the menu” series. Like I’m not gonna eat everything on the menu, I’m gonna eat at ALL OF THEM.
18:16 the nostalgiaaaaa. this was our first big vacation - panema city beach. we passed that margaritaville many times. we went almost everywhere on foot..... simpler times...
you should go to every chuck e cheese in the country now or dave and busters pick your poison :v
rip jimmy eddys favorite guy
next one is bubba gump shrimp
on my birthday i was telling my mom about this video, went to search it up, and opened my phone just in time for the announcement that jimmy buffett had died
This is "Fear and Loathing in Margaritaville"
Thr fact that Jimmy buffet died like right after this is cosmic art
I was not expecting to see a Tim Misny sign during this video yet here we are
Next Video "I ate at every Bubba Gumps in The Country" 2024?!?!?!?!
The Thing didn't always look like that. It used to be a trail you'd walk, and you'd see a ton of things they'd found in the desert. At the end of the trail, the mummy in the box was there. I think they changed owners/management and they added the alien/dinosaur storyline. The original Thing was another experience in and of itself, but the update isn't without its charm.
I'm writing a whole college essay about the advertisement on the billboard at 46:32. Thank you Eddy, for enlightening me
canada being one of the best parts made me so happy to be canadian
Ed and Teds excellent foodventure
this is art
Does anyone think about how this video could have been what killed Jimmy :(
Big fan of watching people’s self inflicted rapid descents into madness
Well now the clock ticks on the bubba gumps video
Jimmy is dead.
Never has there been a better use of Vivaldi’s winter. The rlly fast strings song.
Hard Rock time 🎉
The TN to NJ drive.... 15 hours......... god bless yall
so proud of being from atl :,) i love that they were so kind to you. welcome to atl
Eddy flipping off the Rainforest Cafe was a mood.
You know how they say modern day food would kill a Victorian child. I'm just saying there's definitely a greater than zero percent chance he saw this.
Pornstash
Man, I can't WAIT until he does McDonalds.
I’m sorry why does jschaltt just show up for one??? With no mention as well
18:57 Deep Eddy vodka is really good, a friend showed it to me a few years ago and it’s best for taking shots if you’re someone who is bad at taking shots (like me). it’s made in austin and is inspired by the oldest swimming hole there (also named deep eddy)!
Please please please do a tour of every Bubba Gump, I’m begging you.
Goes to every bubble gup shrimp
When you make a video with other people do you split revenue?
I’m so excited that you filmed the tim misny sign in Cleveland
lol as someone who grew up in El Paso, it was cool to see a tiny glimpse of it, but it was HILARIOUS that you fell for the temptation of the "THING" signs. Gotcha.
46:32 NO MISNEY'S EYES HAUNT MY DREAMS
Funny enough, the only Margaritaville’s I’ve been to we’re outside of the US. RIP Jimmy Buffet.
I can’t believe he died right after this…
Stinky feet
my european mind cannot comprehend this experience
I live that Marc Marons son is so passionate about Margaritaville
Eddy, in the wake of the loss of the man himself, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but there is…. Technically…. One more Margaritaville  https://youtu.be/xVujoz0_dTY?si=wTa5D2c9ooUV600T
Bubba Gump next?
19:00 Why does the Jimmy Buffett quotes look like the warnings on a cigarette pack?
They opened one in San Diego so you’ve got some more work to do
Congratulations on surviving “murder beach,” South Carolina! (That’s what us South Carolinians call Myrtle Beach.) it’s one of the most dangerous places in our state.
this is my first video I've watched from you and you're absolutely hilarious! Love the editing, your commentary and even the audio editing was great
6:17 I felt this in my soul
This video killed jimmy Buffett and no one can convince me otherwise. (This does not upset me in the slightest)
I was making a craft out of bucees plastic bags while I watched this and I’m from an area where we don’t really have bucees and my world is kinda vibrating rn cuz wtf
Jimmy would be proud RIP Jimmy Buffet
Gotta say, was not expecting Tim Misny to pop up in this video
8:34 the dudes in paris ceiling
Next up, HARDROCK CAFE!!!!!!!!!
DO BUBBA GUMP NEXT YEAR
At the Orlando Margaritaville a couple years back I got the Shrimp Mac and Cheese and it was the saltiest thing i have ever eaten and had to return it lol
His poor Tacoma! I love them trucks.
one minute in and im distracted by winter by vivaldi
29:09 the moon is a paid actor 😂
Rest in Peace Jimmy, the Lord of Margaritaville himself
Okay but there’s one in Liberty, MO and I didn’t see you go to that one… hmm
I like the part where he ranked on me for being Floridian. It was valid. I am actually trash.
Watching this at the PCB margaritaville
F in the chat.
37:26 Dollywood is amazing, definitely worth a visit
why am i watching this after watcing teds from the same perspective 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg I grew up going to “destiny USA” however when I was a kid everyone called it Carousel mall, they rebranded to Destiny USA and people just kinda hate the place nowadays seeing it as touristy and I think people kinda see the whole area as crappy
now do every cheesecake factory in the US
Another pointless road trip guys pls…  I’d played your video 30 times or more while waiting the next Roadtrip thanks for the video
Jimmy Buffet went to same university I did. Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, MS. RIP Jimmy!
remember to have some water with every margarita to avoid getting jimmy jeebies the next morning
New ep of my fave show just dropped
i don’t know if you heard this but the man the myth and the margarita legend, Jimmy Buffet has passed.. you of all people need to make a statement during these trying times!
I am freaking dying at how the 4 year old kid played the stinky feet game 😭
So, bubba gump shrimp next?!? 🤔
44:40 LOL Spencer did nothing to you!
I doubt this comment will be seen, but a Dick's Last Resort video would be awesome for this novelty chain restaurant theme.
Omg! I just found out there’s a Margaritaville Cruise and I think that until you’ve eaten something on that boat this video is unfinished! You must right this grave injustice!! Immediately!!
now we need a video of eddy visiting 13,520 mcdonalds in 30 days
I went on that ferris wheel in pigeon forge and while i was waiting in line a couple got off and got yelled at for having sex on it.
You killed him Eddy. You ate Jimmy buffets power
40:55 Ted is so sick of this shit
Here to see Biloxi MS because the Gulf Coast was Buffett's upbringing. He loved the beach and is described as a beach bum by his friends. He loved getting the most out of life by remembering to relax and enjoy it. I remember reading the news and I'm sure this is being recommended to me because I am from MS and have been to the one there.
Yeah but they're about to open a new margaritaville in South Lake Tahoe, so I guess you're gonna have to come here next muahahahahaha
Yo was that the Aggro Crag??
The sequal we didn't know we needed! RIP to the man of the hour himself.
like a few comments I’ve seen before, I think what Eddie‘s diet needs is a few medieval times, Hard Rock Cafe‘s, and Bubba Gump shrimp‘s uber his belt. THEN he can put this series to rest forever.
I love how the video starts with eddy disliking Jimmy buffet to slowly starting to worship  him as time goes on😭😭
You say it's the last time you do something like this, but I know the real last time will be every Chuck E. Cheese in America and Canada.
Sorry eddy, I got a gut feeling jimmy isn’t watching this one.
rock and roll cafe would be cool too!
I'm sorry for your loss
So Kentucky is getting a new Margaritaville.....
Chef Mic is the head chef at this chain lol
RIP Jimmy Buffet
You should go to every McDonalds next
You should do a winter edition.
I watched this again after Jimmy's passing.
THE DESTIN ONE IS WHERE I HAVE MY HEAD SHOTS FORM-
The Mile Level its over 9000
you skipped the one in bossier city, louisiana?
Eddy will just put himself in a situation and then go "aw shucks what a situation I find myself in"
IVE LIVED IN AZ SINCE BIRTH AND STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE THING IN PERSON
I wanna see him fight the tiger from the Rainforest cafe! >:D
I can't wait to wait another year for another adventure
Being a Syracuse native I 100% agree that EVERYTHING out of that place is absolutely the worst - thanks for the visit!
RIP Jimmy Buffet. You brought fun and joy to millions while having a fun and joy filled life yourself.  You had a really good life while helping countless others have good lives as well.   Also you created and left behind a string of businesses that employ hundreds if not thousands of people with pretty good jobs.  You were living the dream while helping others live the dream. Congrats, man.
Did you kill Jimmy Buffett so this would perform better?
They should do Bubba Gump Shrimp next
Go to every dolly wood
please come to boston when it opens, king 👏🏻
I went on the san antonio River Walk boat ride at night once, and I almost got hit by a bat in the face.
But you didn’t go to the margaritaville in Jacksonville Florida so you really did not go to them all… FRAUDS!
So I live in Ocean Springs, next door to Biloxi, MS. The initial opening of the Margaritaville Casino was met with a lot of fanfare. People were really looking forward to having it on the coast. That location initially included the "volcano segment" you witnessed, but it was somewhat different. In the casino, the volcano was a mere prop, and every hour or so, Buffet's "Volcano" song would play, followed by flashing lights and a rumbling noise. Then, a woman would slide down into a pool close to the bar of the Margaritaville restaurant, then sit on a metal hoop that would twirl in the air as she waved to people while "Margaritaville" played. I went a couple times in its initial year of being open, but from day one, there were two things that really weren't going to bode well for the property. One, its location. The beach along the MS Gulf Coast is prime real estate, but some casinos are off the main strip along Highway 90 and are successful. However, that's because they've been around long enough that they have a stable following (Boomtown, IP Casino), or they're easily visible (Scarlet Pearl). Margaritaville was a very small casino built behind a Harrah's and Palace Casino with no clear signage directing patrons to their location, tucked away almost as if it were a dirty secret. Two, lack of amenities. The Margaritaville Casino was built without a hotel. The closest options for lodging around their casino were other casinos. Honestly, I feel the only reason Margaritaville as a casino in Biloxi lasted for two years was because of the fact they were a Margaritaville, but they finally closed that location down, moved Margaritaville to a new location on the beach itself, and changed to the more family-friendly venue you saw. The "Volcano" sequence was brought over, but because it was now an arcade and not a casino, they removed the bikini-clad woman sequence and replaced it with the volcano burping instead. The worst part of that is that it happens every 45 minutes or so while you're there.
Rest in peace jimmy, I hope your eating cheeseburgers In paradise <3
I remember Jimmy buffet, he was in sonic and knuckles right?
GOOF: At 13:12 when Eddy says "Buc-ee's nuts" we can clearly see that he is standing in front of picnic bags, and the shot of the nut wall was simply spliced in.  Behind the scenes: Buc-ee's was founded in 1986 by Arch Beaver Aplin III, and only started expanding outside of Texas in 2018. They won the Best Bathroom Award in 2012.
this is just 59 minutes of one man being indoctrinated into a cult posing as a cocktail themed restaurant chain
RIP Jimmy Buffet. He’s gone down to margaritaville, and enjoying a cheeseburger in paradise.
I can’t believe something like that is successful, that gives me a lot hope
You did not go to the lake lanier one in georgia. Was it closed when you went through Georgia?
i’m pretty sure this road trip is what killed him
I subscribed to note. Ted did 9/11
So what’s next? Medieval Times? Hard Rock cafe? Bubba Gump?
Gotta go to the one in Boston when it's finished to honor Jimmy
They should eat at every McDonald’s next
OMG u stayed at the same hotel i had a miscarriage at🤭 luv u
See y’all next summer when they go to every Hard Rock Cafe
Up next: “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country”
Cool now do McDonalds
please restock these shirts, i need to buy one so bad!
The margaritaville in San Antonio was dogshit. And they got nothing but jimmy buffet on repeat. Terrible music terrible food
Y’know, there’s only 32 Hard Rock Cafes in the US
There is also a cheeseburger in paradise restaurant.
The moment you said you took the Metra into the city, I knew you were from here before you said it.   This was a roller coaster. I feel I have to go watch the Rainforest Cafe marathon of torture now too.
Congrats on being the vid that killed Jimmy Buffet
there is nothing more baffling about this video than eddy's willingness to continually order grilled chicken breast.
i hope jimmy got to see this video
i need this to become a yearly thing of ted and eddie suffering through different chain restaurants across north america
Next year yo should do hard rock cafe
THATS A LEOPARD NOT A CHEETAH
Bubba Gump HAS to be next
Yeah I went to Buckees for the first time last year, and it was quite literally packed shoulder to shoulder with people. It was ✨awful✨it felt like going to a convention but instead of there being other fans and nerds, it's a bunch of people exhausted and irritated from their road trip.
Ned Flanders
Dog in gas station is the most Oklahoman thing too
I stayed at that same key west hotel a year ago, the lizards would harass me in the cabana by the pool
is eddy burbank jimmy buffet christ
the entire piegon forge margaritaville montage was everything
Next go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
There's one in Shreveport... did I miss that one? lol
Rip jimmy
I've lived in Niagara falls my whole life and never been to our margaritaville 😅 always wondered what the inside looked like 😂
But Eddy, this can't be your last trip. What about Bubba Gump?
The Rainforest Cafe video: 😵‍💫🐘🌀😭 The Margaritaville video: 😁💃☀️🏝️
Next video margaritaville cruise?
Eddy calling it Bil-OX-I, instead of Bu-lux- i was so funny  Also nice cameo of the RPDR Live
They’re gonna do it next year
Eddy….can y’all please do all the Chuck E Cheese’s? 😩🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽😭
danny looks like hes ready to burst into tears in the car
JIMMY WILL LIVE ON IN OUR HEARTS
You killed him.
No offense but i clicked on this cause i thought it was cinnamontoastken but im,still liking the video😅
im excited for when they do every Cheesecake Factory XD
Medieval Times trip when
RIP Jimmy buffet 😢
Can't wait for Eddy to visit all 13,520 McDonalds in America
i can assure you jimmy is no longer able to watch this
i hope jimmy saw this before he died. i hope his grandkids showed him it, and then he peacefully died like master oogway in king fu panda.
I'll give you 1000 US dollars if you go to every chuck e cheese .
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next
RIP to a legend. Hope you're having a margarita in paradise Jimmy. It's literally so amazing Eddy made the perfect tribute video at the right moment.
So if y'all are looking for something to do next year, my vote is on Hard Rock Cafe
Buckys is next
So Hard Rock Cafe or planet Hollywood
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
Are new Margaritaville hero
I like how the character development for eddy and ted were kind of in opposite order
Confirmed. Ted did 9/11
Do every Hard Rock Cafe next year!
They're building a margaritaville resort in san diego btw... soon this video will be defunct unless they visit that one too 🫢
Where's the second Glee vid, Eddy 👁️👄👁️
Now every mcdonalds in the country
R.I.P. Jimmy
Fins up for Jimmy ^
I am now going to do this trip in honour of the legend Jimmy Buffet himself… ❤❤❤
RIP Jimmy
Post more eddy please I haven’t eaten in a month:((
Not the aliens having the tightest butt imagineable
And this video is how I found out the only margaritaville i have been to (multiple times may I add) fucking closed and I don’t want to fucking live anymore
RIP Jimmy
The only reason Ted got so happy at the Mall of America Margaritaville was due to its proximity to a Rainforest Cafe. Rainforest Cafes are the only locations where Ted can be fully at peace and reach his true self-actualized form.
I’m in a bourbon bar at night and they’re playing Jimmy Buffet and all I can think about is this video, lol.
I think I speak for everyone when I say part 3 eating at every Hard Rock Cafe is needed and totally a smart idea.
As someone who has been inside a few Spencer's at malls....the stuff there is very, yk...i n t e r e s t i n g
Eddy did you lose weight man? Lookin skinny boi
I can't wait for next year's I went to every Bubba Gump in the country
My dad found out Jimmy died on his birthday. Instead of comforting him, my only thought was, "I wonder if Eddy knows."
wait till they find out about lulu's, the ultimate margaritaville spin-off
This aged well.
OH MY GOD TED AND EDDIE KILLED JIMMY
You guys didn't hit the Margaritaville Resort and Casino in Bossier City LA.
I'll never understand people's obsession with the mall of America.  I know people who drive from out of state just to shop there. Not for me
You should go to every Subway...
Bubba gump shrimp next?
Hard rock??
I can’t believe Ted and Eddy killed Jimmy Buffett
I really hope that Jimmy saw this before he passed.
This video killed Jimmy Buffett
I genuinely loved eating at Margaritaville in Atlantic city. R.I.P Jimmy buffet 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Rip to the goat
Eddy has broken into the echelon of show business that can predict the future Good job man; we're happy for you Don't get assassinated, please
RIP Jimmy Buffet
Idk how I found this but it was the best thing I’ve ever seen 😂
Wait I’m so sorry, but did you go to the Margaritaville in the Ozarks in MO or am I missing it????
Hope he got to see this. RIP
Eddy.... what did you do to Jimmy?
Goodbye Jimmy. Goodbye Jimmy. Goodbye Jimmy. Goodbye Jimmy's dog. Goodbye Jimmy.
What if… Jimmy Buffett dies a month after this video?
arnt you that guy from ifunny
as someone who lives in NM and has never went to the THING im glad i got to experience this through you thank you!
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. is next!
Who knew Bob Belcher had a live video channel?  If not, then the Millennial mustache douchbaggery is getting completely out of control.
oh my god. i live right down the street from the tulsa margaritaville. you probably drove right past where i live :0!
Next year can you go to every Dollywood in the country and Canada
Road trip #3. Eddy and Ted eat at every Medieval Times
rip jimmy buffet
What will it be next year
jakey was in this ! yay.
God rest his zombie bones.
I love the early phrasing that this is the "final" Eddy eats at every Blank video.  as if Hard Rock Cafe isn't waiting, silently in the shadows, ready to strike.
Torture yourself more for the camera please
Hard Rock Cafe next 😎
You killed Jimmy Buffett
These restaurants should be buffet style.
WHAT THE HELL IS THE THING? THE MUSEUM EXPLAINED NOTHING
The angle around 49:50 made me realize how luscious both of their lashes are
You probably should have gotten a water instead of ordering margaritas every time.
28:15 does anyone know where I can find her dress? It is so cute and I need it
Rip Jimmy Buffet
I've neither eaten at Margaritaville nor Rainforest Cafe. My desire to peer into the abyss now compels me to do so.
Jimmy died for our margaritas
RIp
Now he’s in the big Margaritaville in the sky 😔
Dollywood is fun,  you should go
I wonder if he knew about this.
Did you go on Velocicoaster? If so, what did you think of it?
Damn the man killed jimmy
The one in Panama City Beach is just eh, overpriced tourist food, buuut SAD I missed you! That would have been cool too me ya man
Lucky bstard lol
Now you need to go on the Margaritaville cruise out of Florida 🙂
I'm so sorry for your loss 😢
I think Ted started to enjoy himself because they finally left the coastal beach areas that people say are relaxing, but really aren't.
It's crazy to me how Eddy Burback (YouTube) killed Jimmy Buffett
Brother you ate everything, everywhere lol, rainforests.. every burger in Vegas is having a burger at rainforests, would be epic if did a colab with every burger in Vegas, Alex will pay, you pick favorite Vegas burger,  please if read this, I never ask for anything lol. Tyvm tc 🍔
I think Jimmy would have liked this video
As  sb from Germany, I’m so lost about everything in this video 😅 who’s Jimmy, what is that „thing“ thing reminding me about playing GTA5. So many questions
Do bubba gump next
look, he was clearly suffering toward the end of the trip, but he did not actually go to every Margaritavile in the country. Theres one in Missouri he missed.  RIP Jimmy Buffet
Idk I just don’t like these yt guys. Nvr really liked mr.beast even tho sum of his stuff is interesting. This is an interesting video but idk
give me one margarita...
this video killed jimmy, you have to make a statement.
Eddy, in honor of Jimmy Buffett you should give it another go around. Or maybe eat at every all you can eat Buffetts across the country. It’s the least you could do.
God dammit Eddy, you killed Jimmy Buffet.
Aged like fine wine
When I was in Miami I saw the same dude at 22:18 he showed up on a scooter and started to hit a jig in the middle of the street doing the flying thing
I love margaritaville
RIP Jimmy Buffet, he’s being the chillest man in heaven
I can't wait for Eddy and Ted to go to every Hard Rock Cafe next summer
rest in peace jimmy, one of my favorite artists. hope you’re enjoying a margarita wherever you are and watching the sunset. “good times and riches and son of a bitches, i’ve seen more than i can recall” 🩵🍹
Rip jimmy
You skipped the one in Bossier! The jewel of the Ark-La-Tex!
Lmao, sorry about the Syracuse one, dude. It used to be cool, that giant blender hasn't worked in like 6 years. And the gift shop's been gone for like 5.
Jimmy is dead Eddy, see what you’ve done?!? Nah Im just playin, RIP Jimmy
so you basically reinvented cult of Dionysus
WHAT DID YOU DO EDDY?!?
Jimmy withstood a lot, but he couldn't survive the Buffett Burn
Surely you guys have to do every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next? 👀
I am CURRENTLY on the road. Traveling 6 hours to Cleveland from Illinois to go to the margaritaville there. Have to pay my respects
we're all back here for one reason. literally immediate first thought
R.I.P
ngl that "The Thing" tourist trap looked like some hilariously campy fun.
I don't even begin to understand why you would choose a pickup truck for a 9000 mile road trip that has zero need for hauling any cargo.
In which 2 youtubers accidentally create an oddly beautiful tribute to Jimmy Buffett, shortly before his passing.
Planet Hollywood?
I can confirm the Cleveland Margaritaville is trash
RIP 🪦 JIMMY
They released him, may he find his cheeseburger in paradise
It’s always 5 o’clock now🍸🦜
I think this video (or the road trip, more precisely) may have satiated Jimmy's need for carefree, margaritaville style indulgence and released him from the mortal realm.
This will be his legacy
I found this video through a Tumblr post describing Eddy Burback as having 'soulful brown eyes' and an 'expressive moustache'. this was seemingly their first video of his. 👍.
I can't explain it, but somehow these trips are perfect portraits of modern Americana. Edit: Ayyyy, they included Saint Dolly of the Appalachians!
Rip
the dude behind him at 52:11 🤣🤣
Please don’t let this be the final one. You guys haven’t even been to every Cracker Barrel yet
Eddy killed Jimmy Buffet with that buffet burn!!
you killed him...
So you're gonna do Planet Hollywood and Señor Frog's next right?
You decided to rent a car for the trip, and out of all the more comfortable options, you still chose to get a tacoma lmfao
I ate at every spoons in the UK
I wonder if Jimmy saw this before he passed
RIP bozo
"i mean, all that stuff is still happening, but i'm in florida and i had a margarita today" is weirdly uplifting as a quote for some reason. like saying it's not our responsibility as individuals to worry about things we can't control all the time and that it's okay to enjoy your life in spite of the world being generally terrible
I really want y’all to do every Bubba Gump next. The Texas cluster is insane.
Rip jimmy
I love how Eddy keep the lore Ted put in his video,and yet also showed exactly how a persons thought process would be changed by a Margarita-centered cult
YOU killed him
RIP Jimmy
u should do every mcdonalds in the world
i wish you had gotten a full physical and blood tests before and after to see how many years this trip took off your life expectancy    like a roadtrip version of "SuperSize Me" (2004)
You guys should do Hard Rock Cafe next! 😂
Now you and Ted have to go to all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants next year
Now do hard rock cafe
Dare you to do every McDonalds next year
HARD ROCK HARD ROCK
So, next year, all the Bubbagump Shrimp locations?
I think I was watching this vid the moment Jimmy Buffett shat the bed
Did eddy kill jimmy buffet
RIP Jimmy Buffet. He will be missed
Rip Jimmy
Eddy and Ted technically missed a US Margaritaville. The Wyndham Margaritaville vacation club in Puerto Rico.
Time to go to every Hard Rock Cafe!
You destroyed his last horcrux. You killed Jimmy Buffett and freed us from the neverending hellscape of Margaritaville  He'll be waiting for you, son.
The margaritaville that got the ribs and sides to them after the kitchen has closed deserves props. That was nice of them!
Can you at every McDonald’s next?
RIP Jimmy
he missed the one in missouri and i’m still sad about it
eddy reviews margaritaville with relatively not good input, jimmy dies a month later. hmmm
rip jimmy he would've loved this
Judging by the recent comments I am going to assume Jimmy buffet has died lately
RIP Jimmy
I feel like the stages were intended for if like "Jimmys in town and he might want to perform and he legally doesnt have to give notice if he owns the place "  Also now all those stages are probably haunted.
Now it’s time for every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
rip
Waffle house next
Rip jimmy
I really hope Jimmy got to see these videos while he was still here because he would have loved them.
RIP to Jimmy’s existence, RIP to Eddy’s gallbladder
wait until he hears about the airport ones
Most poorly timed video, or the best timed video? Hmm the views on this are gonna jump higher then possibly imagined i bet lol.
Why do you pronounce Biloxi that way😭
Jimmy is dead now tho 🫢
Where is the visit to every buccees trip?
R.I.P jimmy i hope he finally found margarita ville and is eating a cheese burger in paradise😔
Eddy fix your upload schedule or I swear to god I will fucking find you.
You fucking killed him
Watching this video again because jimmys gone💔 we love you margarita man
He saw this video and died
It was this video that killed him EDDY
It's so weird this came out a month ago considering
Come to think of it, I think I was at the Biloxi Mississippi Margaritaville before it became a whole resort…
The next Food Chain should be Hard Rock Café
Every Hard Rock Cafe next?
40:35  well not anymore. Rip jimmy
RIP Jimmy "MargaritaVill" Buffett
do you think jimmy heard about ted and eddy before his passing?
RIP to the man who made vacation shirts cool year round
I'm going to finish this video today in memory of Jimmy Buffett
was it you? be honest
It's the 4th time I click on this video, in an attempt to finish it. I will return until my quest is complete
MAY HE REST IN PEACE, I literally thought of this and Ted’s video and went “they fucking killed him”
Damn they done lost their cult leader !!!...too soon? 😬
Hmmm... now in hindsight... is it possible that Eddy killed Jimmy Buffet by running up such a massive tab at Margaritaville?
the skunk was my favorite part
RIP to a real one pour out a margarita for Jimmy
"No one likes Jimmy Buffet except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!" - a wise man. ✨ RIP Jimmy, OBE. ✨
YOU KILLED JIMMY BUFFETT
RIP Jimmy, may you be remembered by your too-sweet margs and these 58 minutes of utter chaos
NOOOO JIMMY
RIP Jimmy we love you
Do this again but going to every bubba gump shrimp
RIP Jimmy 💔
I'm still annoyed they closed the Sydney venue down😫 it's been years but still it had good food & I don't drink but my sister & friends loved their drinks. We went to Orlando last year & margartaville was on our plans after universal studio day & we had a great time. RIP Jimmy
RIP to the legend that is Jimmy Buffet. May he have a Burger in Paradise in Paradise 🙏
Eddy went to every margaritavillle and then Jimmy Buffet died right after. Coincidence? I think not
hey are you so quiet for jimmy....say somethinggggggg
Lol why are you doing this again? I know it’s a different restaurant but I thought you hated this last time
Parrot Heads, we know what we have to do. RIP Jimmy, gone, NEVER forgotten
rest in peace jimmy buffett
rip jimmy
My mom and I are massive Jimmy Buffet fans, we were planning a trip to Niagara to go to margaritaville next spring… found out he passed on my birthday of all days 😢 RIP Jimmy you were so loved
I feel like Jimmy might habe found closure in this video❤
I'm so excited for y'all to go to every Hard Rock Cafe next year and every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co the year after that!
lmfao the green mnm blowing you a kiss
RIP Jimmy😥🍹
46:31 misny makes margaritaville pay
omg spencer’s 😂😂😂
Now you should eat at every margaritaville in the world.
ripd jimmy
Now do the ones outside the US to fulfill Jimmy’s wish
F
you guys fuckink killed jimmy buffet
RIP jimmy! Your legacy lives on through Eddy losing his sanity at all of your restaurants🍹🦜🍔
When you’re randomly watching a video on YouTube and you see yourself walking to work in the background.
Please tell me this was a covert mission to destroy Jimmy's horcrilux's
RIP :(
Rip to the king who made this possible
RIP Jimmy ❤️ And actually, do Bubba Gump Shrimp locations next!
Next up, Hard Rock
this video caused jimmy buffet's death, delete your channel
I uhh.. I think this did him in. Congrats, Eddie, you killed him. :^)
Damn, this video must’ve broken his heart
WHAT DID YOU DO
RIP Jimmy
RIP Jimmy 😢
I think that he should go to the Margaritaville location in the Bahamas to pay tribute to Jimbo.
It’s time to go back
I'm posting this comment within a flood of them, but I thought I'd try to ask. Would you consider a limited re release of the Margarita Cabana shirt in tribute to Jimmy? I'd be one of the first in line.
This trip definitely didn't have any consequences...
RIP 😢 JIMMY 🤵‍♂️ BUFFET 💀🍸😢
Quite a way to artificially boost this video's views Eddy.
Next up Hard Rock Cafe the. Planet Hollywood
R.I.P sweet prince
its 5'o clock in heaven
This video is now poetic ever since the passing of Jimmy Buffet
The best tribute to a legend
Rip
As a Canadian near Niagara Falls, I am proud that you both loved our Margaritaville haha.
RIP Jimmy, enjoy that cheeseburger in paradise, it’s 5 o’clock forever now.
What about the Margaritaville at the Lake of the Ozarks?? 🤷🏼‍♀️
RIP jimmy😢😢
Do none of these restaurants have a BUFFET!? 😂😂😂
There's a Margaritaville in the Jamaica airport that is on par with the worst places I've ever eaten. Regardless, you guys made the big guy proud.
We need a video of Jimmy from him now
Dollywood is one of the best amusement parks
I finally got to visit a margaritaville in Nashville. That night jimmy passed away. I went back the next night and they were chanting “Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy” after every live performance. RIP king
this video hits so much more now that Jimmy Buffet had his unfortunate passing
As someone who lives near Cleveland, seeing the shot of Tim Misny's eyebrows on the billboard at 46:33 cracked me up
I feel like Hard Rock Cafe is next
Rip man
R.I.P the Parrot King himself..... Just went to Chicagos Margarittaville in honor of him
rip to jimmy came back to this video just to let his spirit shine a lil more, he was truly free
At least Jimmy got to see this video before he died
I found out about the death of Jimmy Buffet through Eddy’s comment section.
This killed Jimmy Buffet. Hope y’all are happy
Did you do it!?
untimely
i’m so happy that they appreciate the river walk 😌 i love san antonio
RIP Jimmy Bro
You should go to bubba gump
I was clocking out at universal Orlando and walked past them making this. It all makes sense now, fins up guys!
Rip Jimmy
As soon as I heard the news. I returned to leave my condolences. Hopefully Jimmy is on a beach watching this video right now
I hope Jimmy saw this and I hope he chuckled a few times. Godspeed to the Parrot King.
Watching this one again.
At the part with the Cat in the Hat ride I could hear the Mike Meyers version go “cha ching”
Rip jummy buffet
And now this video exists as a sort of memorial
Rest in peace Jimmy, rest easy sweet prince
Watching this in memory of Jimmy, another Cheeseburger in Paradise🍔🕊️🍹
rip jim
Margaritaville isn’t just a song, Margaritaville isn’t just a restaurant, Margaritaville is a lifestyle.  ￼ RIP ￼to the son of a sailor Jimmy Buffett, ￼ I bet he’s enjoying a cheeseburger in Paradise right now.
RIP Jimmy 🎸
Eddy did you kill Jimmy.
rip king
Great video. Can’t wait to see where you guys go next year!
Rip Jimmy. in the end you made it to Margaritaville afterall 🥲
Rip jimmy buffet
This has become Eddy Burback's biggest "YIKES" moment.
What kind of Cosmic Coincidence is it that Jimmy Buffet fucking DIED a month after Eddy made this god forsaken video. This video is cursed, it killed Jimmy and you cannot convince me otherwise.
@eddy You didn't go to the one in the Detroit Airport
Those 'Goodbye Jimmy' at the end hit differently now..
R.I.P. Jimmy Buffett. You left behind a great legacy and now millions of people can remember it through this video. Thank you Eddy, though you may not have planned this, you're a great person.
RIP JIMMY
congrats on being the first thing one million people thought of when they read the news today
Did this video kill him tho?
Rest in Margaritaville Jimmy.
RIP JIMMY.
Did.....Did Eddie's video do something to Jimmy?
This one’s for Jimmy.
Confident that Ted and Eddy visiting each of his restaurants is what finally gave Jimmy the peace to leave this earthly plane. 😇
I want the margarita button up!!
you killed him, plead your case
Wasting away, this time for real
RIP Jimmy!
rip jimmy buffett ong
This would make jimmy buffet proud
RIP JAMES. :(
Eddy I don't think jimmys gonna listen anymore :(
Watching this almost 10 years to the day I had my first and only Margaritaville experience in Nashville. Goddamn wild!, man!
The timing
RIP Mr Margaritaville Jimmy Buffett.
I love Jimmy Buffett, and I love that this video reconnected me with a childhood favorite right before he passed. Hope Jimmy got to see it before he sailed away for the last time like the jolly mon! 💚
Why is it so dramatic compared to Ted some how 😭
Back here to wish Jimmy a fond farewell, may his memory live on through Eddy’s work 🍸🌴
I think this should be a yearly trip Next year: Hard Rock Cafe
And now Jimmy's gone to the final Margartaville, the one in the sky.
Rip jimmy :(
EDDY YOU KILLED HIM jk but now we want you to do it all again for jimmy!!!!!
Coming here to remember Jimmy, here’s to you Mr. Buffett, I know your songs by heart and I will live and die in 3/4 time like you did.
RIP Jimmy buffet
I really resonated with the cinematic masterpiece that was Mall of America. Kubrick and Villeneuve would be proud
Dear god Eddy what have you done.
RIP in peace
I wonder if Jimmy heard about this video before he went
RIP JIMMY
was*
Rip to Jimmy Buffet 🫶🏻
Watching this again in Jimmy’s honor
I can’t believe Eddy went on this trip only to end off with him killing Jimmy Buffet, rip 🍸
Do it again in honor of his life

Just rewatched the entire episode with the entire family. Does anyone know if Jimmy Buffet ever watched and commented on the original video? RIP Jimmy.
good thing you didnt bring teds toyota tacoma, otherwise you would have to deal with the football basketball sized hole in the floor of the passenger side
Im glad to see a lot of people cameback because of the passing of Jimmy Buffet. Never really knew of him but its still sad to see a good person go.
I wonder if he saw this video before he went... Either way, RIP to the Margaritaville man himself. Enjoy your cheeseburger in paradise.
I can guarantee Jimmy is not watching this
This video was Jimmy's last straw
Rest in peace Jimmy Buffett in the great Margaritaville in the sky
You killed him Eddy you broke his spirits
Now he can finally rest in peace. He just needed you eddy.
Rest in peace Jimmy Buffett
RIP Jimmy Buffett... I have no idea who you are, but i remembered this video and your name in it.

The video that killed Jimmy
Rip Jimmy Buffet ✌️🇺🇸
R.I.P Jimmy Buffet
I literally just stumbled on this video with no idea of who Jimmy Buffett is just to find out he passed. Crazy to see what he’s accomplished, although not to my individual taste the scale of these business ventures is quite impressive!
You opened a portal to Margaritahell and killed Jimmy Buffet with this video man. RIP Jimmy.
you killed him
there is just no way
RIP Jimmy Buffet, you legend
I guess the beach and margarita life style ISNT the way to live
9/3/2023 Jimmy has gone to that beach in the sky
Rip Jimmy
Life gave you limes, let’s celebrate!
this is what broke the curse, and finally freed Jimothy Buffet's immortal soul, allowing him to pass on after 50,000 years of beach bum livin'. Still took him a month to die though, had to put it off to get one last beach trip in
May you Rest In Peace Jimmy
I know you had something to do with this. It had to be you
Rest in Power margarita man
rip jimmy buffet
RIP jimmy
DID YOU DO THIS EDDY? LET ME KNOW SOON. WAS IT THE SHRIMP? IS THAT WHY YOU DID IT? A BAD BURGER GONE SOUTH?
he died of skin cancer that metastasized... i hate to say it but thats so on-brand for jimmy, fins up o7
So... pretty sure now that their undercover mission on this trip was to destroy each of the Jimmy Buffet horcruxes inside each Margaritaville.
I think you guys killed Jimmy
RIP Jimmy. You made so many people happy throughout your years, and it’s heartwarming that this video serves as an unintentional tribute to us all. I hope you’re at peace up in the margaritaville in the sky and eating cheeseburgers in paradise <3
This  K I L L E D  Jimmy
RIP JIMMY BUFFETT
Rip jimmy
Rest easy Jimmy at the Margarita Villa in the sky
Rip Jimbo mayne
Rest in peace, Jimmy Buffet!
Rip to big Jim himself we have icy margs for you
RIP Jimmy. He shall be missed.
This video was so good it Killed Jimmy Buffet.
Watching this again in honor of Jimmy. Fins up.
I cannot wait for Eddie to visit 40 Papa John’s, in 30 days. Only then will the Day of Reckoning unfold
Rest in peace Jimmy
RIP Jimmy B, our king of Margaritas.
Rewatching this for Jimmy.
RIP Jimmy❤️❤️
RIP JIMMY BUFFET
A small fairy creature had appeared to Jimmy, promising that he would live forever… until someone ate at all of his restaurants. That was why there are so many Margaritavilles. Buffet was going to live eternally, millennia after the fall of man, until this guy screwed everything up for a stupid youtube video.
RIP Jimmy B, now resides forever in the Margaritaville in the sky
Eddy killed Jimmy Buffet by completing the impossible
This watch is for you parrot heads RIP to the king of the beach bums
Rip jimmy
Rest in peace Jimmy
Damn, RIP in peace Jimmy. He’s in the Margaritaville in the sky now
did you kill jimmy?
Rip
This killed Jimmy Buffet
Get yourself a pour spout. 7 seconds tequila 4 seconds triple-sec 6 seconds lime syrup 4-5 seconds sweet n sour Put it in a shaker and don’t forget that salt and lime!!
Rip jimmy
holy shit
This aged well.
Now that Jimmy has passed, I believe this video grants you and Ted executive privileges over the Margaritaville throne
RIP jimmy, it’s 5 o’clock somewhere
RIP Jimmy boy, it's 5 o'clock somewhere in heaven
Unbeknownst to Eddy & Teddy, going to every single Margaritaville was actually a ritual that took take away Jimmy's immortality.
Rip Jimmy 😢
Rest in Peace Jimmy, hope you are living it up in the Margaritaville in the sky.
Rest in margaritaville Jimmy
Rip Jimmy ❤😢
Please dont visit trump tower if you like to visit restraunts before the owner passes 😅
Rip jimmy
Rip Jimmy Buffett 🍹
RIP JIMMY BUFFETT
RIP
I'm sorry for your loss.
A Toast! To Jimmy Buffett, RIP Jimmy, may you be in hamburger paradise with a margarita in hand. 🍸 🍔
Just came here to say RIP in peace Jimmy Buffet, I see others have also arrived to pay their respects lol
Every McDonalds in America next?
Rip jimmy buffet
As a german, my first question was: WTF is a "Margaritaville"?? — And here I was thinking anti-italian racism didn't exist, but this concept sounds like it is /j
R.I.P Jimmy Buffet, we took an amazing trip in all your margaritavilles, thanks to Eddy, and I hope you enjoy that cheeseburger in paradise.
RIP in peace jimmy <3
RIP JIMMY
You fucking killed him
RIP Jimmy, thanks for everything.
Rest in peace Jimmy
Can’t believe he’s gone…
Well since king jimmy passed away it’s only fitting you do a memorial tour of all the restaurants now.
Why is everything so empty?
RIP jimmy, you would have loved this vidoe
I regret to inform everyone that Jimmy has passed
RIP Jimmy thank you for your service eddy 🫡
..This video aged either very well, or very poorly depending on how you look at it.
Steven Schussler, the founder of the Rainforest Cafe restaurant, is probably sweating right now after seeing what happened to Jimmy Buffett.  Eddy Burbank has spared him... For now.
RIP Jimmy Buffett, I bought Songs That You Know By Heart on iTunes years ago so there's a chance you got my money from the record label. Also your absurd restaurants are a wonder to behold.
Rest in peace, Jimmy!
Margaritaville is a very ordinary song. AI could do better.
JIMMY BUFFET FUCKING DIED 🤯
RIP Jimmy
I’m not sure how, but you and Ted killed jimmy buffet.
came back here just to say rest in Margaritaville, Jimmy
Dude, you jinxed his lifespan.  As a matter of respect, you MUST repeat this trip and raise a glass of Margarita in his honour/honor at every location.
Eddie Burback, the Angel of Death
40:35 that's an official oof
I had to come back after hearing the news. RIP Jimmy 😢

Did you not take footage from the New Orleans location? I was excited to see that one because that's where I'm from. But you skipped from Bourbon Street straight to the resort in Biloxi.
RIP Jimmy, I'm sure he will be proud of you
Jimmy what did you do
RIP Jimmy Buffet... Will always be remembered

Rest in Paradise, Jimmy. What a legacy!
Most of the coworkers at the post office I work at were talking about Jimmy's passing earlier. I don't really care much for easy listening since i'm a masochist at heart (and thoroughly plastered), but that only makes me appreciate this video more

Rip jimmy buffet

RIP JIMMY!
RIP Jimmy. You were one of the good ones.
I’m not saying there’s a correlation, but it’s interesting to note that shortly after Eddy released this video, Jimmy Buffett dies.
What a heartwarming tribute to Jimmy’s legacy. Glad you made this happen
Rest in Peace Jimmy ❤
RIP Jimmy Buffet, glad you got to do this before he passed.  “If there’s a heaven for me, I’m sure it has a beach attached” - JB.
Rip to Jimmy buffet. I bet he’s resting happy knowing that someone went to every one of his Margaritavilles
RIP JIMMY B
Jimmy Buffet is dead now.
RIP Jimmy!
did anyone else come back here after hearing the sad news?
I think he snapped and found and murked Jimmy
57:02 snifff….goodbye, Jimmy
R.I.P Jimmy Buffett 💜
RIP to the legend
RIP Jimmy Buffet :,(  My parents always listened to Jimmy when I was a kid growing up. Even still to this day "Cheeseburger in paradise" and "A pirate looks at fourty" are some of my favorite songs. They will randomly pop in my head and I'll begin singing and humming them. People, myself included untill I looked him up after watching this video a month ago. Don't realize he had a cult like following similar to the grateful dead. Also despite him living on sponge cake and watching the sun bake he was clearly very savvy in business. Being one of only a handful of musicians with a net worth of 1 billion. Like us all though, despite your wealth, impact and recognition we are all human at the end of the day. The Margaritaville man himself went to heaven last night and left nothing but a positive impression behind him.
Now that Jimmy is gone this video will probably absolutely explode in views
You killed him with this video   I hope he had a chance to watch this
RIP JIMMY BUFFET
Rip jimmy buffet
RIP Mr. Buffet
Rip jimmy
watching this in honor of the late great James Buffett 💔
POUR ONE OUT FOR THE LEGAND
Damn. RIP Jimmy. What a loss. Tip of the ol’ straw hat to you boss💔

Watching this video every year from now on. Rest In Peace Jimmy Buffet
Pouring out a margarita to the big guy
I think we all must come back to this video on this sad day. RIP legend
Eddy and Ted are now obligated to do what no physicist, philosopher, or theologian has ever done and find a way to bridge the gap between this world and the next so that they can visit the Margaritaville Heaven Location and complete their road trip.
DID YOU KILL JIMMY BUFFET BY EATING AT ALL OF HIS CHAINS?
Watching this again to honour the margarita man himself. RIP Mr. Buffett
rip the legend
Eddy, did you hear about Jimmy buffet passing? Glad you guys got to go before.
Look at what you’ve done.

I feel like I've been on an epic adventure. It's ironic I watched this the day Jimmy died, but I suppose it's a fitting send off.  Here's to you, Eddy Burback. Rushing in where angels fear to tread. In every single Margaritaville.
You did this for him. The one last tribute to his greatness. RIP Jimmy

RIP 🪦 Jimmy Buffett curator of good vibes 😎 😭
Rip Jimmy. I definitely think the timing of his passing is awkward
RIP to a legend man, hope he finds his lost shaker of salt in that one particular harbor
I watched the Ted version of this first and went into the Margaritaville video knowing the Mall of America situation 😂. Excited to see your take now 🎉
Rest in Power Jimmy.
I like to think that Jimmy passing is sort of a Willy Wonka situation where he's finally ready to rest now that he's found a boy worthy of inheriting his chocolate factory: Eddie Burback
EDDY WHAT DID YOU DO TO JIMMY
Rest in Peace Jimmy Buffett, gone to the great big Margaritaville in the sky
I'm sorry for your loss.
RIP to the legend himself, Jimmy Buffett
RIP Jimmy Buffett. Damn Eddy, your timing on this was unbelievable.
Hey, Eddy. I know it must be devastating to know that Jimmy has died recently. In honor of him, you should probably do this all again, but backwards for variety's sake.
rip to the man himself
RIP to the legend
RIP Jimmy. 🦜
REST IN PEACE JIMMY
Rest in paradise to the man Jimmy Buffett, I’m back here today to watch in his memory 💕

R.I.P to the legend Jimmy Buffet
I can't say how much Jimmy and his music meant to me, and how it is something me and my father both love. Rest in peace Jimmy, thank you for everything, but especially putting Eddy through this video. Go sail that big ocean in the sky.

This video might’ve done it RIP Jimmy
RIP JIMMY BUFFET AT LEAST THIS VIDEO CAME OUT BEFORE HE PASSED
Rip Jimmy Buffet, hope you’re handling the news okay Eddy. Jimmy came to Eddy in a dream, inceptioned the idea of the margaritaville trip into Eddy’s head, all so he could be trained in the foot steps of Jimmy as an apprentice. Only now you’ve completed your pilgrimage to margaritaville did he feel comfortable letting go and leaving the legacy to you Eddy. We’re all so proud of you.
I came to this video as soon as I heard that Jimmy Buffett has passed away.
EDDY, HE DIED. JIMMY BUFFET DIED. You have sustained his legacy.
RIP Jimmy Buffet

YOU KILLED HIM
Rest easy Jimmy Buffett- Margaritaville was never a destination, (except the 22 locations in US and Canda with one in the works in Boston) Margaritaville was the journey, it was an emotion. It was the sunset on a Florida beach, it was the feeling of awe of fireworks over the Niagara Falls.  Perhaps we all are in Margaritaville. We’ll see you there soon, Jimmy!  1946-Eternity
RIP Jimmy Buffett
Rip jimmy
Rip to our buddy, Jimmy. It'll always be 5 o'clock in Heaven.

Came back here to pay respect to the legend himself.  Pour one out for our man Jimmy B, he will be missed.
rest in peace jimmy buffet🙏
Rip Jimmy.  It is now your duty to carry on the spirit of Jimmy
Rip Jimmy Buffett
Rest in peace Jimmy

I had zero interest to go to USA other than seeing New York, maybe. But... This seems like a fun road trip. Not for Margaritaville, but the cities they are located in.
The hood lost a real one today gang
It is fortunate you got this out a month ago as if you waited until now it would have seemed like capitalizing on Jimmy's death for clicks.
Rest in peace Jimmy
RIP
Rest in peace Jimmy.
RIP to a real one. The giant novelty blenders will stand as a monument to Jimmy Buffett's memory.

Revisiting this video on September 2 2023. Rip jimmy. I never knew a time in my life where you weren’t a part of making happy memories with my dad. Thank you for that and for the comfort and support my dad always finds in your music. To all the parrot heads out there, we lost the man but the community will live on forever. Let’s mourn him by celebrating his life. ❤️❤️❤️

Hey they are opening a new one in South Lake Tahoe
I like that the latest comments are split between "what a beautiful unintentional tribute to Jimmy" and "YOU KILLED HIM." Either way, may he rest in Margaritaville. It's 5 o'clock everywhere now.
Rip Jimmy, thank you for being the king of good weekend vibes and torturing Eddie for like a month with your weird margarita themed restaurants. I salute you 🫡

Well, may his legacy live on through Ted and Eddy.  Jimmy Buffet would be proud. May he rest in margaritaville, enjoying all the margaritas and beaches he could ever dream of. And maybe just maybe Jimmy saw this video before he passed. May Jimmy's legacy live on through the margaritas coursing through Eddy and Ted's veins.
Rip Jimmy Buffet
Rest in peace Jimmy Buffet. Margaritavilles will never be the same without you.
RIP Jimmy Buffet
RIP Jimmy Buffet. He's found the real Margaritaville now. May he be eating Cheese Burger's in Paradise for an eternity. Thank you for everything you absolute legend.
I just saw a post that Jimmy Buffett has passed away. And before I had no real connection to him. I watched your video and I've known the songs. I lived on Catalina Island and people over there were pretty obsessed with him. But I never really understood it. I didn't get it. And for some reason I find myself rewatching your video and just bawling my eyes out. I'm also pregnant, and I know that has a lot to do with it. But I found myself mourning somebody who made people happy. If I knew nothing about him, I know that he made people happy. And I think that was the whole point of his restaurants, yeah it's just a restaurant, but the whole point, the whole vibe is supposed to be to let go and have fun.   RIP Jimmy, you're probably drinking margaritas in heaven now
Rip Jimmy Buffet
The fact Jimmie passed away makes this way more epic.
Rest in peace the legend Jimmy buffet. This video means so much more now than ever.
rip jimmy buffett

Though the trip had seemed long, arduous, and perhaps even pointless, one man watched. One man watched the journey. He saw the ups and downs. The kindness of the staff and the questionable jumbalaya. The tropical parties and the heart burn. He saw the plane, over and over again. Finally as the trip concluded, the watcher said “the culmination of my brand encapsulated in a single video. My very essence. The spirit of margaritaville, for surely it is not merely a chain of overpriced bar food, but a way of life. The spirit of margaritaville lives on in these two men”. With that, the man died, confident his spirit of alcoholism and beaches would be forever encapsulated within Ted and Eddy, or teddy if you want to be weird about it.
RIP Jimmy
RIP Jimmy Buffet 😢
RIP to Jimmy
Eddy are you doing okay?
Jimmy’s spirit can now rest knowing that Eddy knows the true meaning of Cheeseburger in Paradise… RIP Jimmy!

EDDIE WHAT DID YOU DO TO JIMMY BUFFET??
Rip jimmy buffet 😢
Jimmy Buffett just died
Jimmy is dead yall 😭😭😭 waking up to that news this morning BROKE ME.
rip jimmy buffet 😔🍸
RIP Jimmy Buffet
Glad you guys got to enjoy the Jimmy Buffet experience before he passed. It may have been borderline torturous at times, but you understood and respected his philosophy, and tried to embody that laid back, beach bum lifestyle for a time before succumbing to madness. A Perfect Margarita and Cheeseburger in Paradise is an enjoyable novelty, but for the 22nd time in the middle of the paved paradise of Vegas? You trapped yourself in Jimmy Buffets Hotel California experience for us, and we thank you. R.I.P. Jimmy Buffet you legendary beach bum. Hope you’re sailing high  P.S. would love to see a tribute by visiting the soon to open Boston location  P.P.S. Even Buffet got sick of his songs sometimes, so don’t feel too bad lol
Just finished this video last night and wake up to the news that Jimmy Buffett passed away, RIP to a legend
Eddy I’m not going to be mad I promise…but what did you do to Jimmy?
RIP JIMMY BUFFET!
Rip Jimmy buffet!!!!
Rip Jimbo
Umm how did you know that Jimmy Buffet was going to pass away a month after you posted this??
RIP Jimmy. Enjoy the big Margaritaville in the sky

Good news, I guess, Jimmy has died and you're free from the Margaritaville!

RIP Jimmy Buffet , Well always have the time we shared with Eddy and the Jumpin Jambalaya
rip jimmy buffet 😢
RIP JIMMY!!!!!
I regret to inform you that Jimmy Buffet has passed. By visiting every Margaritaville, you broke all the seals and Jimmy was unleashed. It’s sad to see him go.
Rip Jimmy Buffet. This deserves multiple viewings in his memory
Rest in peace Jimmy❤
RIP JIM JIM
Rest in Peace, Jimmy. 🏖🍹🍔  We're beachin' for you today.
May Jimmy R.I.P. I'm sure he'd be proud of you.
Fun fact cheeesburger in paridise is also the name of a hawian burger chain
This aged quickly. 😢
RIP Jimmy but atleast the burp and angelic choir make sense now
As of 9/2 Rest in peace Jimmy Buffett
Eddy, what have you done? Where’s Jimmy?
RIP jimmy <3
I imagine Jimmy died happy knowing someone went to all of his North American Margaritaville locations.  RIP Jimmy
Jimmy Buffett just died today. We can hope he saw this video first.
RIP Jimmy 🍸💚
rest in paradise, jim 💔
Rip Jimmy Buffet 🙏
RIP
Rip Jimmy
RIP to our lord and savior Jimmy Buffet
Rip Jimmy Buffet
Released only a month before Jimmy died kinda suspicious, Eddy
RIP to the legend Jimmy. May he live on in paradise
RIP Jimmy.
RIP Jimmy :(
Jimmy be with you, may he rest with a cold one in hand.
RIP Jimmy Buffet, he’s in margaritasville now.
So he just died last night on Sep. 1st. The first thing i thought about was this video
Rest in peace Jimmy. Will will never forget your jambalaya.
RIP Jimmy.
Here's a list of other (mostly) themed chain restaurants in the USA and Canada with a number of locations:  Bubba Gump Shrimp: 23 Joe's Crab Shack: 36 Hooters: 306 Benihana: 94 Chuck E. Cheese: 434 Peter Piper Pizza: 129 Medieval Times(more of a theatre show but eh): 10 Hard Rock Cafe: 33 Dick's Last Resort: 15 T.G.I. Friday's: 281 Cheesecake Factory: 200 Cracker Barrel: 611 Planet Hollywood: 2(3 if the hotel in Las Vegas counts) Johnny Rockets: 126  Those are all I can think of at the moment. Some numbers are probably off because I'm tired as hell. Did not think there were THAT many Cracker Barrels. Bubba Gump Shrimp, Hard Rock Cafe, Dick's Last Resort and I guess Medieval Times would be great videos if you'd want to do such a thing.
I'd like to see this again, but maybe with a monkeys paw type thing going on. So like when that first cop asked for the dent out, maybe change the entire car or something lol. Someone asks for a donut but instead gets a giant donut sign landing on them
Hope Jimmy saw this video, he would had a laugh. RIP Hope he's having a cheeseburger and margarita up there
Rip Jimmy Buffett
Rip
RIP Jimmy fly high big dog 😢
RIP Jimmy Buffet! 1946-2023
RIP Jimmy Buffett, you will be missed
Damn it seems fitting that the man who indirectly created this video, died 1 month later and 2 weeks later 😕
R.I.P. Jimmy
Alas our king of Margaritaville passed away on September 1st, 2023; may this journey forever commemorate his life and hopefully he is finally enjoying his "Cheeseburger in Paradise".
RIP Jimmy Buffett... now you're serving shitty food at the beach in heaven <3

Jimmy Buffett may be gone but he’ll always be with you. Every time you want a margarita just know he’s smiling off camera like a Star Wars force ghost.

RIP Jimmy
Rip the homie Jimmy Buffett
Eddie. My husband and I watched your video numerous times when you first posted it — we loved it because you captured Jimmy’s essence and spirit perfectly. Thank you for doing this. I’m posting now because, well, we lost our Son of a Sailor Man… Thank you for documenting how inspirational he is.   Fins Up, Jimmy 🦈
We have gathered this day not from how we know each other, but of how we have come to know this man in our hearts.
RIP my man Jimmy Buffet :(
…Well damn here we are
Jimmy is looking down from the big Margaritaville in the sky
Rip king
WELP
First thing that came to mind - I hope Jimmy saw this while he was alive.
Weird place to come to mourn somebody, but I'm glad I'm not alone. RIP Jimmy 😢
RIP Jimmy. He just passed yesterday, September 1st. Just last weekend I watched this video with my grandparents because they love Jimmy and we are planning a trip to Florida.
You jinxed it Eddy. Holy shit
Eddy where were you 10pm September 1st?
Sorry about your loss 😢
Rip Jimmy
Rest in peace Jimmy, hope you found he found his lost shaker of salt 🫡
Rest in Peace Jimmy Buffet.
Everyone Jimmy Buffet himself passed away last night😢
Whose here cause Jimmy Buffett just passed away
As a lifelong Jimmy Buffett fan, I'm glad that Eddy, Ted, and so many others along the way got to experience a little bit of Jimmy's magic while he was still here to spread it himself. RIP Jimmy Buffett. We'll always have Margaritaville.
Is next year gonna be Bubba Gump Shrimp (22) or Hard Rock Cafe (32 + 1 in Hawaii)
rip jimmy
RIP Jimmy Buffett
RIP :(
Rest in peace Jimmy. Margaritaville is very real
Rip jimmy
I hope jimmy got to see this video before he died
Since Jimmy passed today, this requires a rewatch to remember what he preached
Coming here to pay my respects on the news of Jimmy Buffett’s passing. RIP Margaritaville King
he killed jimmy buffett with a 1 hour youtube video. this was a hit piece. he has powers beyond our understanding.
rip jimmy
RIP Jimmy, see ya on the flip side
This video is cursed. You murdered Jimmy Buffett!
Pretty sure Jimmy Buffet died knowing someone had the patience to go to every Margaritaville.
RIP Jimmy
rest in peace jimmy buffett
RIP Jimmy Buffet
RIP Jimmy
RIP Jimmy. Hopefully he at least heard of this journey before he passed, I think he would’ve been proud.
RIP
May Jimmy Buffet rest in peace. <3
Rip Jimmy Buffet
Rip jimmy
i wonder if he watched this before he passed away
RIP Jimmy Buffett
I'm in the middle of watching this and just got the alert that Jimmy passed away. This fucking sucks. I've been a Parrot Head since I was born.
RIP IN PEACE JIMMY!!!! 😭
RIP JIMMY
On the night of September 1st, Jimmy Buffett sadly passed away at the age of 76 surrounded by his loved ones. May this video be remembered as a memory for his love of music, margaritas, and cheeseburgers. Sail on in paradise sailor…
Ted gives me Brenden Frasier vibes
There is a restaurant that is now called Beef' N' Buns N' Paradise. It used to be called Cheeseburger in Paradise but it got sued by Jimmy Buffet. Some of the best burgers on the East Coast though.
46:31 TIM MISNY SPOTTED
RIP
I live in vegas and their last trip inspired me to go to the rainforest cafe here. Now it seems i have to go to the margaritaville here too
mor vidya. mor vidya make hapin.
As a musician, I absolutely hate playing that song margaritaville at wedding gigs and private parties. Also as a musician? I applaud Jimmy Buffet for parlaying his music into other sources of income and notoriety!  As a YouTuber?? Dude eddy, you’re a legend. I’m curious as to what made you come up with these ideas for this and rainforest and other stuff. I’d love to hear about it. Anyway…if you happen to read this…thanks and, much love from Philadelphia.
This is so out of pocket but I came across this video while dying my hair , I put on a video and after it ended I couldn’t touch my remote because I had dye all over my hands so this video started playing next and as random as this video is I sat through all of it even finishing it off after my hair was done 💀💀 anyways proud to say I’m a new subscriber it’s what Eddie deserves after eating so much margaritaville🤧
I am from Syracuse and ate at that margaritaville once… that was enough
So, whats next years trip?
Some of Eddy’s finest work
go to all of the ikeas, there are 52.
I love the dichotomy between Ted and Eddy's videos. One guy is just going with the flow and trying to enjoy a long trip, while the other is slowly losing his mind.
you should do McDonald's next
You left out the best part of Blonde Stranger.   'Back on the ranch and everything's normal Beach blanket bingo comes on the TV We talk in our sleep and then the next morning I ask her who's Dan and she asks who's Marie?'
No restaurant-owning Jimmy is  safe.
So Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock Cafe next year?
I thought samus was taking over the US
If you pause at 9:22 you can tell that The Thing? staff are not familiar with draft animal farming 🤣🤣
This is so pointless yet so worth it. I love content like this
My little sister worked at the Rainforest Cafe in the Mall of America for a while. Michael Jackson actually went in while she was working there once, which... I don't know, seemed cool at the time?
please you have to now know about the the parrot head club, it is basically a cult to jimmy buffet, my dad is the treasurer in texas, ill send an email as well with the website and maybe you could talk to him
52:50 You look lonely, I can fix that
Next up is every McDonalds in the country🤞
Every Margaritaville* *except the one in Missouri
Here the ones I’ve been to so far:  14:22 I’ve stayed at that hotel twice, but not because it was a normal vacation. My theatre troupe used to have to go to biloxi every February to compete at this singing/dancing competition called “access broadway” and a lot of my friends’ families would pick this hotel (my family stayed there when we went in 2020 and 2022) And everyone would always go to the arcade in that hotel to celebrate after the competition!! Dang I miss those days 17:27 I went to destin twice in my life. For my 10th birthday 5 years ago and some point when I was 12. I actually do remember eating at the margaritaville there the 2nd time I met 19:40 I went to Panama City for my 13th birthday in 2021 and besides going to the beach and going to Dave and busters to play some arcade games we ate there. As usual I just got the basic stuff there ;)
How much do we have to pay for the toe cut?
They just opened one up in downtown San Diego……. Just saying 😂
Fun fact: Tropical Isle in New Orleans used to play nothing but Jimmy Buffett over the P.A. as a play on Margaritaville.   They even had live musicians covering Jimmy Buffett.
"Final" - so what chain is happening next year?
Wait you didn't go to the one in SPI! South Padre Island! I would have loved to see y'all in my neck of the woods!! TwT #Puro956
I predict next year will be Bubba Gump Shrimp. Around 20 restaurants in the US. On the plus side I think there are 4 in the LA area, so you could stay at home and only visit one a day at the start (or end) of the trip.
Can't wait for the Bubba Gump road trip next year.
Next year will be the ultimate bucees run
So.. is this gonna be an annual thing now??
As a certified Floridian, can confirm  The cat in a hat ride is terrifying
What about hillsboro oregon
It would be a shame if Eddy didn't eat at every Hard Rock Cafe.
I need them to do medieval times next
Next year are we doing Bubba gump?
09909099099999909900990999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999⁹99999999999999999999000099999909😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
From what I've heard, "the Thing" used to be a mummified child someone found in a cave near Wilcox, AZ, and they replaced it with the papier mache thing when people realized that that was fucked up
There is one in PALM SPRINGS!!
The most authentic part of this video had to be the Notorious Atlanta Traffic. It's not Atlanta unless your ETA suddenly increases by 2 hours for NO reason. Excellent video.
As a Floridian, the Rainforest Cafe in Disney Springs caused me to have an autistic meltdown as an adult, I can't imagine how it would be to visit as a kid (thank God my parents were too poor to go there when I was a kid lol)
When's "I ate at every Hooters in the country" happening Eddy?
As someone who grew up taking road trips from AZ to El Passo, I'm so happy that they talked about The Thing!!
I kinda think they are a little more than co-producers.
I'm waiting for Hard Rock Cafe.
oh my god wisconsin dells mention. put a jumpscare warning next time LMAO
I'm so glad that really funny toes bit was done in this video like 18 times. Way to go Eddy.
22:08 OMFG that guy was me, if this had been 27 years ago. I ate some datura in Coral Gables, with no money, and set off on foot. Next thing I know, it was the end of the day and I was in Homestead, with money. Miami was always some good times. I'd been born there, so I went back to see the address on my birth certificate. The datura was just growing in the back yard, with a mango tree and and sour orange tree that had a passion fruit vine.
“I. Beat the child.” - Eddy Burback
Do wawa next lmao
49:30 This exchange was the line of the year lol
Sooo Bubba Gump’s next? Or Hard Rock Cafe?
When are you going to every Medieval Times? There's only ten locations (1 in Canada, 9 in US). On the negative side, there is only a single menu (unless you also do the vegetarian/vegan menu). On the plus side, you get to watch fights and jousting. Also on the negative side, a meal will take like, three hours each.
As someone who lives in Ohio, I love that one of the first images he showed for Cleveland was a Tim Misny sign
Dollywood is legit so fun (and also right by where I live so maybe I'm biased but also Dolly is a legend) so I highly recommend you find your way back there sometime!
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
Hard Rock Cafes next???
39:38 quite literally almost killed me
you should do this with dick’s last resort it would be so funny to see how the insults would vary for each one
42:57 that one shot of ryan gosling in blade runner 2049
Such a wonderful video your nigh symbiosis with Jimmy is comedy beauty
I was at the Niagara location last year around this time. Fun stuff.
Every Hard Rock Cafe in the US or Baba Gump shrimp Co next year?
Currently at Margaritaville in San Diego, all the way from the UK, thanks Eddie
i’m so glad we’re finally talking about the cat in the hat ride bc that shit is horrifying
eat at every applebees in the country
Sounds like it's time to go to Bubba Gump shrimp Co next!
What about St. Thomas though
I like how you guys progressively get more red after eating only trash food for a month lmao
Eddy you know what’s next and I’m upset no one has said it yet… Bubba Gumps is calling your name Eddy
hard rock cafe
What's next tho? Hard Rock Cafes? please say Hard Rock cafes
Next year's Road Trip: Chuck E Cheese in every state
This shit still hits. Perfect for a rainy day 😊
2:23 everything is pointless. *smileyface*
Buckeys rubs buckeys nuts 😂😂 13:29
Did you go to the conroe tx location & I just missed it during my potty break? 🥺
Eddy, what about eating at the Margaritaville in Conroe, TX. 600 Margaritaville, Park Way, Montgomery, TX 77356
Next year, you and Ted should go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country (and Canada). It’ll make this whole “I Ate At Every [blank] in the Country” thing the best ‘trilogy that was never meant to be a trilogy’ since the Hobbit trilogy. But you know, without the baggage that had.  [EDIT: 21:56-22:02 - Well this hits hard now. RIP Jimmy.]
Eddy censoring his feet shouldn’t have floored me as hard as it did but damn was that funny
It would be cool if you did this with every mcdonalds 😃
almost the same background room as wendigoon
The only question I have is, why the hell would you ever rent a Tacoma for 9000 miles spent just on hwys 😀
Okay- but hear me out here. Margharitaville at sea.
surreal seeing a mall near me on youtube
Skipped the Margaritaville in Jacksonville NOOOOOO
Planet hollywood next
Oh SHIT! Coolest motherfuckers on the PLANET!
Next go to all six flags water parks and amusement parks
It is a tradition for my friends and I to ride the cat in the hat ride because of how cursed it is
Haha..... He thinks it's the last time.... OK EDDY
imagine they soemthing like this next year
Place your bets on where they go next.  Islands, Johnny rockets, Ruby’s cafe, or McDonald’s.
I love how this is an hour long
It just dawned on me the first margaritaville they go to after the questioning of who did 9/11 just so happens to be the only one that schlatt joins them in. Coincidence, I THINK NOT!
i have watched this like 7 times
Hearing the hatred towards Syracuse makes me happy
Now go to all the ones out of the country.
Stinky feet seems like a Dan Schneider side project.
I lived twenty minutes from The Thing for 15 months, but could never force myself to see what it actually as. Thanks for satisfying my curiousity.
for the grande finale of this trilogy, eddy should do all the hard rock hotels or something
Ted even got a moustache in the end lf the trip.
tw jschlatt jumpscare
I’ve been to the Destiny Mall’s Margaritaville! Lol  You went to the back of the Spencers, didn’t you? The cute plushies lure you in, and before you realize it you see the true horrors of humanity….
Those massive hotels and resorts are crazy because it is based on a song
jimmy would love this video
I need a dolly wood episode
Not bad - some fun moments here! Margaritaville is what it is, never pretends, and kinda rules!
I'll see you in a year when you go to every HardRock cafe
"i think it might be a dog whistle" "i think it might be tinnitus!"
Eddie did not go to my margaritaville in lake Conroe and I am HEARTBROKEN
Now Olive garden!
I was fully expecting a surprise Jimmy Buffet Cameo in the "Goodbye Jimmy" section at the end.
I no longer comment on videos, but I love the longer videos (30 minutes to 50 minutes) over the 15-minute content. Outstanding production has always been great, and I'm glad I now have something to binge-watch while working. Thanks, Eddy!
45:08 this made me laugh so hard for no reason
Still doing the lord’s work I see.
Eddie saying he lived in Chicago when he lived in the suburbs of Chicago is the most accurate thing someone who lives in the suburbs could say
I wanna go on the cat in the hat ride right now
Change it up next year. Visit every six flags in the country👌
You should try every Spaghetti Factory! There are so many + the food/drinks are actually great. The ambiance is less overwhelming but the one by me has a trolley inside and there always seems to be interesting people...and if you can't spot them maybe it is you hehehe
Eddy's videos have been such a comfort pick for me. He's the perfect balance of funny without being filled with overused rapid fire editing while still being relaxing when I could just listen to over and over while doing work
Up Next: Every Hard Rock Cafe in America
We visit every Chuck-e-Cheese in the united states and CANADA~!!
What if Warren Buffet bought all the maritavilles from Jimmy Buffet ?
Dare I even bring up the idea of...... every hard rock cafe?
Every time you came across a rainforest cafe I just feckin died.
Please review the movie Swarmed from 2005. It is so dumb. It’s about mutated wasps who escape a lab and go on a killing spree.
17:00 Yeah, they do that. I was playing Minecraft Dungeons and if you put in £2, instead of giving you two lives, it activates a second player and a kid just walked up, started playing alongside me, and didn’t say anything until we beat the level, I had a far higher score, I put my next coin in and he went “I can help you figure out what cards to use” in this cocky kid way as if I don’t have a Minecraft Dungeons Arcade addiction that means I’ve played the game to death and know my damn cards.
we need a video where they go to all the hard rock cafes in america
Time to do Bubba Gump Shrimp and the Hardrock Cafe
Oh no are you gay?
Simp
Go to every hooters in the country
Hard Rock Cafe (World Edition) Please
The dells tho>>>
Gotta do the Hard Rock Cafe!!
So I've actually been to Pigeon Forge a few times. It's amazing. Dollywood is amazing. That entertainment center is amazing. Beating my younger sibling at lazer tag will be a memory I treasure in my heart forever, along with going with them to Dollywood and winning plushies for both me and them. I highly recommend it.
Very nice of Jimmy to play at Cartman’s aids fund
i never heard of margaritaville at all in my life until this video and suddenly its everywhere
I still havent gone to the Syracuse Margaritaville even though its only 30mins away
They missed the margaritaville on the Margaritaville at Sea Paradise the margaritaville themed and owned cruise ship
I know everyone wants you to go to medieval times next but please don’t go until the strike is over and MT recognizes their performers union. The performers have been on strike for months and the NLRB has issued complaints against the company for union busting and retaliation.
ok but that hat you didn't buy did look good
This was an inspirational, life changing video, I cried, 10/10
I feel high on the Cat in the Hat ride. Last time I went on it, I was 14 and laughed hysterically throughout the entire thing
Duuude, if only I planned my trip to Pigeon Forge a bit sooner
Do joes crab shack next
Next one has to be every Hard Rock Cafe. There’s like 32 of them😂
Am I stupid and just miss it? Or did you not go to the Margaritaville located in Capitola, CA? Love these videos btw. You’re great, Eddy!
This may have been mentioned, but there are Margaritaville Restaurants at US Territories. I ate at one in St. Thomas.
Looks like someone needs to clean the bean!
ok next time go to every mcdonalds in the usa AND canada
as a kid the cat and the hat ride was engraved into my memory, my mom didn’t wanna go on with me so i vividly remember being above her and being able to see them as it brought me back into that pit of hell
this is the lamest thing I've ever seen
you kinda look like harvey from stardew valley
Yeah but what about Home Town Buffet?
The shirt is sold out 😢, will it come back in stock?
Bubba gump shrimp next :)
now all you need to do is go to all the hard rock cafe
Do McDonald’s next!
should we tell them about the margaritaville cruice
This is a video that I have already watched multiple times and it never gets old.
maybe i'm going crazy right now but eddy soundsl iek masculine ben shapiro... just a little bit
Hard rock cafe next!
42:08 it's funny to assume these guys as native chicagoans are aware that  a. the artist of the bean does NOT LIKE it being called the bean b. the artist of the bean is an asshole
I feel like i wasted my 20s not doing things like this.
Subscribed because of the toes bit
For real, shout out to the manager in Atlanta. She kept the ball rolling and saved the video
You should try visiting every bubba gump shrimp co. restaurants on your next road trip.
he missed margaritaville on lake conroe
31:01 made me realize I like the face because he is like a cat
and noooooowwwwww for Hard Rock Cafe
The way the boy you travel with moves is like an action figure or an old man in the winter. Very interesting!
I’m so glad you hit the algorithm that pushed this video to me. Definitely watching the rainforest cafe one too
I've been playing Stardew Valley as of late, and now that my brain has made the connection, I can no longer unsee it:  Eddy looks like Harvey
7:08 that tinnitus joke is literally so funny why does it kill me every time
This is a public service
With that beard I thought you were CinnamonToastKen xD
The Lighthouse (2019)
You guys gotta eat at every Bubba Gump now
They should do this with every Medieval Times
I watched the rain forest cafe videos and I'm so glad the algorithm brought me back
LOL at all of Ted's merch purchases
Every Hard Rock Cafe….
28:37 Burback Live Reaction
As a kid who grew up in Orlando, I was in fact terrified of the cat in the hat ride. Like I would start crying if my family wanted to go on it.
57:22 "Our 😊 Second... 😏 and 🤭 FINAL 😉😝 🤪 roadtrip 🛻💨"
You mispronounced Biloxi. It's ok everyone does. Bill-ux-ee by the way
So you went the one in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg? The same day? Lol.
You're wasted. Again. In Magaritaville. Also, it's in Minnesota, in winter. Welcome to hell, Eddy.
I cant describe how in-character it is for Syracuse to have the worst Margaritaville in the country. I commend you for braving the death trap that is Destiny Mall 🫡
52:52 Is that a Blade Runner reference?
Planet Hollywood sitting in the background at the end just asking to be the focus of the third descent into madness
I was there on that ferris wheel, not at the same time but I recognized the place so, yeaaaahh...
I'm fairly certain that Eddy is actually Ned Flanders
Dollywood is a must go!!! In my small southern town I grew up in that literally had nothing, that was the highlight of my life. Not six flags, not Hershey Park, no no...Dollywood. It's not only her theme park but a WHOLE water park too, and if you liked country, pretty much every person played there and you could see it for free with your theme park ticket. Also, I mean it's Dolly like how could you not like it!? Anybody who has the chance should go!
God I'm so glad they stopped at The Thing. I fucking loved that place growing up.
Wow, you’re just wasting away.
I remember back in 2018 I was driving to Gatlinburg and I just happen to stumble upon Dollywood.
@daveportney @barstool someone please show this to Dave
2:25 the cutoff was hilarious
I'm so fucking mad I wasn't working the day Eddy came through ours.
Born and raised in Myrtle beach, that warm feeling of jimmys hands on your shoulders is normal, but oddly enough for me as I got older, that feeling wouldn’t happen as often when I went in
Didn't see it... what about air margaritaville in Detroit airport? 🤔
Excellent video Eddy! Can’t wait to see you do every Hard Rock Cafe in the world next!
Man the US are fucking weird :D
Now do McDonald's
actually what is happening in the US? i have never even heard of jimmy buffet and he OWNS MULTIPLE OVERSIZED NEIGHBOURHOODS???????? they look way too big and empty to believe anyone lives there. maybe im just too australian and british to understand large things and themed restaurant chains
My mom and dad met at a margarita ville, so thanks jimmy
Like i get that it's his bit now to be a real annoying little bitch but two long ass videos, come on eddy
All I'm saying is you did both of these trips and managed to dodge the Pacific Northwest BOTH times...  Just throwing that out there 🙂
Wait you know jordan ???? Can you tell him I say hi I’m a big fan
As someone who previously lived in Tulsa for years, I’m shocked that the food at the OK location was one of the best… also, I’ve definitely bought drugs at that casino lol.
Eddy: I’m tired of eating the same food Me, an ADHDer: *laughs in Kraft Mac and cheese safe food that I could eat literally every day*
My stomach started hurting after Miami
didn't go to the margaritaville hotel in nashville!!!
How do you miss the original margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio???
As a native Texan I can confirm that all the best restaurants do indeed have big puddles next to your table
you need to to do hard rock cafe next.
A friend of mine and I went to Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe this weekend to see if it was really that bad, and it was. We were at the Mall of America locations and actually got seated by the same server you two had. Yang was awesome and even remembered where the two of you sat. I'm glad you came back to Minnesota for another visit, and I hope you decide to do another trip that takes you to another terrible restaurant.
Eddy, come to StL and eat a wonderfuo burger cooked by myself. There is also the City Museum, which would make for one amazing video (i mean that sincerely).
I cannot imagine the amount of fake sugar mixed drinks you had to endure.
The thing is so sad. It’s obviously a dead child
this is a coming of age film
SHIT, THERES ONE BEING MADE IN MY BOSTON??
Wait what happened to the one in New Orleans?
NEXT SUMMER, YOU AND TED HAVE TO GO TO EVERY CHUCK-E-CHEESE IN THE US. IT'S PERFECT.
Spent the entire video wondering why Ted looked familiar to me. I assumed it was because I’d seen him on the internet before.   It dawned on me three minutes to the end of the video that we went to college together 🤣 He was a year behind me and I saw him everywhere on campus. We never spoke but glad to see he’s doing well!!!! Well…. Maybe not after all that Margaritaville…. Hahaha
This was so fucking insane and stupid I not only watched it I subscribed!
This video was worth it just for The Thing (tm) Museum.
Great video!! Now do it again, but this time visiting every Bubba Gump in the United States.
Do Hard Rock Café  Complete the trilogy
I short wheeze laughed at least 5 times during this video.  Thank you for this.
I just got home from a 1500 mile drive which puts this in context a little bit more for me.... north america is SO BIG. You guys are legends.
Did I fully watch both videos for both trips? Yes yes I did, still kinda like yours more eddy
Try Crackerbarrel next 😮
Respectfully Eddie has the best masc lesbian style
Am I the only one who keeps crying every-time they mention friends… envy I guess
You know you’re a waste of a human when instead of making real memories you watch others make memories
"Liking Buffett isnt some weird cult thing... It's what can fix me!"
Next trip is all the Hard Rock restaurants in the the U.S. annnnnnndds CANADA
“Our final road-trip.” Please go to all the Joe’s Crab Shacks though. They’re dying out.
I dry heaved at that PCB Margaritaville after trying the hottest sauce at the hot sauce place right by it
I'll never forget years ago sitting at the bar with my dad and his friend while underage. What a place.
This was Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House.
Next you should go to Wahlburgers, from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. I had the distinct displeasure of ordering a Marky Mark Sour
I'm so fuckin sorry you did that, dude. I saw this title and immediately thought "bro you didn't have to do this" but hey, someone had to.  Chase that dollar, and Godspeed
Looked forward to the all Taco Bells in the US next year
Gotta go to every great wolf lodge 😂
Y’all skipped the Jacksonville, FL location
Vegas! 🎉❤
Now go to bubba gump shrimp 😃
Wait if you rented a car for this why the heck did you rent another truck instead of something way more fuel efficient? Clearly money's not an obstacle for you but still, wasteful
Why do you look like if a minion could grow facial hair
oh my god going to all the midevil times would be so good
Los Angeles got a whole stadium from SoFi. All you got was a 24 day car ride. You got ripped off dude.
Next Eddy Burback video: I shit in every bathroom in the USA
"And we of course left a tip"  You don't... you don't normally leave tips?
Do dicks last resort around the country next!!
As a Brit, I think this is equal parts bizarre and violently American
A couple weeks ago I was in destin and at that pear near you
margaritaville turning eddy into world of tshirts is something i’d never expect
You never went to the one in cumming GA
Can’t wait for next year when they go to every single bubba gump shrimp
You’re like a male safiya naygard
Go to every longhorn steakhouse 💀💀💀
Dew danny and Curtis
The Wisconsin dells shout out 🤪
There’s only 34 hard rock cafes in the us
What a great video,  so funny and well done.   Good shit sir
With 2 entries in the Theme Restaurant Cinematic Universe, I can't wait for the 3rd entry
Wow, after all that you were most certainly peeing out of your butt, aka taking a "number 3"
35:00 i hope those employees (manager included) get some recognition for being so awesome. As a former line cook, i would have probably said yes but thats because i make amazing pizza and everyone deserves to eat my pizza
Now do every Hard Rock please!
As a native Oklahoman it somehow made me happy that the Tulsa location had good food, but also simultaneously sad that he didn’t know who Mr. Money Bags is 😂
You crazy man, you crazy.
39:14 He’s standing in the exact spot I learned my girlfriend of 3 years was cheating on me lmfao I haven’t been there since. It was a shock to see it again
So which is next for you guys?
You should try going to every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant
It's like an American Gods spin off only there's no god
All I’m saying next time every buc ees
You skipped the one on lake Lanier
So he's hitting all the US Hard Rock Cafes next, right?
Jechatt
Maybe the real Margaritaville was the friends we made along the way
I have heard multiple reports that Jimmy Buffet is a tremendous douchebag. This is just what i've heard... Pencil Thin Moustache is ok i guess.
If y’all decide to do this ever again may I suggest the Hard Rock Cafe? Only seven in the country. None in Canada or Florida for that matter.
So Hard rock is next year?
Can I please join you guys when you visit every Hard Rock Cafe?
Every Hard Rock Cafe in the country and Canada for next year.
Eddy's next video: I visited every mcdonalds in the country
whats next year?
Can't wait for the three-peat
Ah, to be able to take a day off.
give me 1 margarita
39:45 I've watched this video more times than I should admit, and this fucking slays me every single time.  That's our proud little guy!
Need me a friend like these two to do a Hard Rock Cafe trip across the US
no lie the cat in the hat ride caught on fire while i was in line and i never got to see it 😔🤚🏻
Not until the one in construction gets finished
cracker barrel next
Next you should eat at every McDonalds in America.
Ill die peacefully when he goes to every buc-ees
Why not go to every park with rides and shit and eat there to
They look super similar Eddy & Chrissy yeah
As someone who has made the drive between AZ and New Mexico more times than I can count, I want to personally thank you for showing us The Thing. I have seen that sign sooo many times, but I’ve never actually stopped to see it for myself. My curiosity has officially been satisfied thanks to you.
24:55 to skip the sponsor
I have to say getting hit with horrendous stand-still traffic is pretty much the most Atlanta thing to happen, you lived like a local
Isn’t there a margaritaville in Palm Springs?
Charles Barkley would have a field day if he saw that big ass chair in san antonio at 12:03
You skipped Hollywood FL?
today i learned that there’s not one, not two, not three, but four margaritaville themed hotels/resorts
Every hard rock Cafe next?
It’s weird seeing one of the biggest attractions in my area show up in a cross country road trip video.
Sad to see they didn't visit the one in Breaux Bridge, LA. It's probably for the best, though- it sorta sucks (thanks to incompetent management).
Well, I am from Florida and the rain… is a nightmare every time for me. There was a hole in my roof for some months. And yes, I will tell Mickey Mouse.
watching this again cause its just that good! keep up the great work!
The 2 minute dedicated to Syracuse is accurate
New road trip idea: eddie and ted drive along the hardy's and carl's jr. continental divide. One of them is team hardys and the other is team carl's jr. and the whole time ted learns to love both while eddie slowly loses it until he can never eat a cheeseburger again
Obsessed with the glowing review of the Syracuse, NY location 😂
I just want to share that while I was watching this I got a spam call from “Santa Margarita” CA
you guys now gotta go to every bubba shrimp in the country ........... there's about 22 locations ...
you should do medieval times next summer
I sneezed, so it again😁
lol i live in atlanta and the first thing i thought of when you said you had to go to atanta.... was .... did you have rlly bad traffic  its so bad
now you can go to all 27 Six flags on the entire North American Continent
Now its time for Dick's Last Resort!
The Rainforest Cafe revisit is like visiting kanto in gen2.
Eddy being classy AF praising the location that fed you even tho they were closed. Also, y'all are very brave for using a public grill
Sir you skipped the one in Montgomery Texas
Wait did the margaritaville in uncasville ct close? I was expecting the stop at the Mohegan sun location I’m curious now
The Bean makes everything better
Do all red lobbster
Another certified classic. Great video Eddy!
now eat at every subway in america
So Tommy Bahamas or Bubba Gump Shrimp next?
eddy saying biloxi at 14:28 honestly might be the funniest part of this video as i am from there and he did in fact not pronounce it right
There are 34 hard rock cafes in the US. Thought you ought to know
I associate this channel with you torturing yourself for no reason, so the first half of the video felt really weird for how much you liked it
Third times a charm
You know this means you have to do every Buccees in America now right ?
i was really hoping you brought ted with you to torture him on your trip instead thist ime.
Can we expect cheesecake factory?
I’m happy you got the complete Atlanta experience. Traffic and friendly people.
He missed a margaritaville in conroe Texas… I’m so sorry
There are 172 Mellow Mushrooms JS
ik you said youre not this again but i remember how much you hated doing this with RFC, i have proposition: Every Hard Rock Cafe in America. I'll join you in Atlantic city with a massive group of your fans if you're down. I know a guy who knows a guy.
Hard Rock Cafe next.
I am watching this while eating in Margaritaville Miami.
"the day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" a line that completely took me out
You HAVE to do Bubba Gump’s now
Now do Hard Rock
he's been touring since the 1970's.
No Shreveport-Bossier Margaritaville??
Got that jimmy’s jammin jambalaya in myrtle beach like 6-7 years ago. That shit sucked. Still one of the worst meals I’ve gotten from any restaurant.
So is he going to Boston location when it opens this  fall???
Every space aliens grill and bar?
next you gotta do bubba gumps shrimp company
Can you do bubba gump shrimp co next?
why did you say biloxi like that
I went to the margarita-vile in Tennessee and choked on the fish.  Then I proceeded to stay in an arcade until 2 Am with my Grandfather.😐
No Lake of the Ozarks Margaritaville?
So the Hard Rock Cafe is next right?!
you should do this again but mcdonalds
Nothing quite like watching a man descend into madness two years in a row.
the wet burger 33:40 just looks like its been steamed pretty sure
I could've sworn there used to be a Margaritaville at the Mohegan Sun Casino here in CT. Funny enough, I also think there used to be a Rainforest Cafe at the Westfarms Mall, which is also in CT. Maybe they both closed.
Next up bubba gump shrimp
Next time they should go to every waterpark in America and see how many diseases they contract
Can you and Ted do a run of every medieval times next year? Would be a fun trip.
I live in Myrtle Beach. We love our Margarittaville
I've started to live my life by a new code. I wake up every morning and think WWCED?, What Would Cool Eddy Do?
Didn’t you also go to every Tim hortons?
Ah yes the Framingham MA, experience
He should do bubba Gump shrimp next year
If y’all ever do this style video again y’all should try to eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the US!!!!
I was on Dunky...  Sorry dude, new YouTube, who dis? You know what I'm saying.......?
Facts about buckys!😂
im from cleveland and i'm midly upset you didn't say more about. or came and said hi:(
ive been to pidgeon forge twice. Dollywood is fucking awesome granted i love dolly parton shes an american treasure. however, the island at pidgeon forge which is where that margaritaville is at, is the most depressing place ever. i went there with my family and every other parent and family besides ours looked like it was a last ditch effort to save a failing marriage or win over custody of the kids and me and my family made jokes about it the whole fucking time. also did you see the fountain that has lights in it that make a sperm cell?
Your mustache pisses me off so much
Next one should be "eating at every McDonald's in the country"
it's hard to see someone else living your dream...
47:12 is my favorite part
My family took a trip to Pigeon Forge over the weekend and it was our first big trip in like 10 years. All week leading up to it, I was campaigning for us to hit Margaritaville on the Island, which was like 5 minutes away from our hotel. I couldn't promise good food, but I could promise drinks and fun.   On our first night there, we set out for the Island and tensions were high, as they usually are after an 8-hour drive. Margaritaville changed the course of our journey. We were happier. We were kinder with one another. It started the best trip of my life. . .   You failed to mention the photographer, though.   Thanks, Eddy and Ted.
This dude probably likes girls to poop in his chest. Don’t know why I feel like this is true just do.
bi LOXIE ?!? what kind of maniac pronounces it that way 🤢
Hey I saw you and Ted in Epcot during this! 😂
Why tf don't yall just rent an SUV or van or some shit lol???
This video makes me excited for the "I ate at every McDonalds in the country"
You should go to every Bubbu Gump Shrimp Co next
Next year: I went to an Applebees in every state in America
holy fuck i’m from biloxi a surreal experience seeing eddy and ted in  one of the biggest shit stains in the town LMAO fun arcade tho what a wonderful thing to experience
so when you say you’ll never do this again i hear that you’ll probably do this again for hard rock cafe
EVERY MEDIEVAL TIMES IN THE COUNTRY PLEASEEEEEEEE
"I might kill Ted".
51:27 jimmy has stolen the light from your eyes
Was excited to see you go to the one in Sandusky, OH. Didn't realize that it's not affiliated with Jimmy 😢.
Can I have a water please
next year: hardrock cafe
Forgot about Tulsa y’all!
Every Hard Rock Cafe is next
Go to Cinnabon next!!!
Woooo I live in the dells love it here and the wisconsin river
Who’s the girl you was with at the first Margaritaville. New to the Channel and I’ve definitely seen her before but I can’t place her 😅
So Cheesecake Factory next?
Looking forward to next years Hard Rock Cafe trip
Next year: going to ever McDonald’s in the US‼️
Now do every hard rock cafe
Please I hate to do this to you but  I think a video of you going to every Dicks last resorts would b an amazing video or even a Bubba gump shrimp Co
There are 23 Bubba Gump Shrimps in the United States.
49:05 HOLY SHIT THE BELVEDERE OIASIS
You should do The Old Spaghetti Factory there’s like 43 location
As someone who grew up in Ocean Springs MS, the way he said Biloxi made me choke. 😭
okay but what if you round it out with one final trip. a third trip............ to all of the Bubba Gump's Shrimp Co in North America.  there's one on the strip in Vegas
wjho jimmy buffat
Go the extra mile and visit every Bubba gumps
Still think they should get every bag from every Trader Joes. Like don't stop at EVERY Trader Joes but you need all the regional bags. P.S I live in Syracuse. I go to Destiny. The man went into Spencers? I feel for you sir. I feel for you. Nobody warned him.
Shut up and go tell mickey mouse 💀
We went to margaritaville on our honeymoon in Pigeon Forge..it was a bit of a shock to me lmao was definitley wild and mediocre. Only good thing was our moonshine drinks😅
Go to all of the Buccees 😂
I saw Ted recently at The Broad in LA and I think he was wearing that same exact fit in 12:09
This was such a fun video, definitely didnt feel like an hour
Such a uniquely American experience
Imagine if visiting national themed restaurants every year became a tradition.
As someone that grew up in Atlanta, can confirm the traffic
amazing
cant wait for next year's bubba gump video
stop because the buc-ees experience is SO REAL, buc-ees scares me actually shitless
Great, now visit all Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s
Do the forest gump restaurant now!
I think I was in Panama as the same time Is u damn I wish I could’ve met you
EDDY HERE ME OUT! Next year y'all should go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp, who doesn't love the best movie in the whole world Forrest Gump???
only true chicagoans know that the beans real name is cloud gate and only truer chicagoans call it the bean despite knowing that  (fuck anish kapoor)
bro next time try to change every time the thing that you're eating but a wonderful video btw NEXT YEAR ALL OF THE HARD ROCK Cafe
YOU CAME TO THE MS GULF COAST?? I love how you pronounce Biloxi 😂
9:36 guilty as charged
You guys should do every Dick’s Last Resort next.
Say what you want about, rainforest Cafe, shit on Margaritaville till the cows come home, IDGAF. BUT DONT YOU EVER SLANDER BUCKEES, HE AND THAT GAS STATION WONDERLAND ARE AN AMERICAN TREASURE WITH FOOD BETTER THAN 90% OF CHAIN RESTAURANTS
This video is now invalid being that there’s one in Breaux Bridge, LA now
Bro!!!! You didn’t go to the cheeseburger in paradise chain restaurants😂😂 there’s one in Sterling Heights Michigan
I spent the whole video dreading the one in my state (Oklahoma) only to be pleasantly surprised
I’m saying it now. If he ever reaches 100 million subs, he should go to every McDonalds in the country.
Yeah, I grew up in Syracuse NY. The whole City is sad 😂
Gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next
god youve got stamina, i went on a 5 day trip to paris and on the second day [first had been traveling] i craved so much nutrience i bought a litre smoothie
I didn't realize they had closed the margaritaville in New Orleans. There used to be one right on the edge of the French quarter
I enjoy that all the rainforest cafe throwback images are intentionally blurry lol it very much adds to the aesthetic
Now visit all the Cracker Barrel locations
As a non-American viewer this video has mainly made me realize how much of the US looks like a theme park
so hard rock cafe is next?
So are they going to do Hard Rock Cafe next year? (Just saying there are 34 locations in the US and 2 in Canada)
Weirdly proud to be Canadian right now
Do Dave & Busters next
boat table fucking rocks
he’s got a restaurant named after his wife too, you can’t leave the whole family out of it
why did you rent a takoma to drive across the country?
When are you eating at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company you coward
Now do every McDonald's
margaritaville is made for people with the case of the mondays
Did the lake Tahoe one open after shooting this?
why?
YUHHHH KEYWEST🔥🔥🔥
Hawaii is in the US. What about Margaritaville HI?!
Watching this video was weird because I did basic training and then did the Riverwalk, tech school in Biloxi, and got stationed in Texas. So I've been to most of these places lol
Bravo!!
Do a 3rd one!!
What if... You made a museum that makes even more stupid people doubtful of reality for stupid made up shit...
Ummmm, there's a margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks😂😂😂
Do Hardrock Cafe next!
I've also seen The Thing, except my exhibit was on the history or torture devices.
As someone who lives in Texas and goes to the River Walk and Bucees, it’s nice to see you enjoy it. Warms my heart a bit(:
That guy with the Margaritaville shirt, the cool guy.. said no one.  For dads who gave up YEARS ago. They are enjoying their savings HOW they wish.
Btw last weekend I literally saw a car on the highway with a WWJBD (What Would Jimmy Buffett Do) bumper sticker. It's inescapable.
please do medieval times
I think you misses the one in missouri
I think he should do this again but with Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
These guys seem like all right dudes...content predictable, bland, uninspired...please pray for Americans if this is considered quality entertainment...not worth the price (free YouTube). Thanks for the effort Eddy.
Do every McDonald’s in the country.
Please go to every Bubba Gumps next… I’m begging you.
Sugar factory may be a fun (albeit horrendous) chain to do next year. there's 25 locations in the US, if you include the one in Hawaii
You don’t order fish when the nearest ocean is 600 miles away lmaooo
“I Jimmy’d a little too close to the sun”
Do all McDonalds next. Should only take you about 10 years or so eating burgers every single day.
Oh, next year you should eat at every McDonald's in North America.
Now do Hard Rock Café
Dude I really hope y'all do Bubba Gump. It seems like the perfect finale for this saga.
I feel like this video needed end credits.
Everyone says Bubba Gump but consider... Medieval Times
Syracuse worst margaritaville slay! Love seeing my hometown represented!!
Eddy your hair looks great in this video! Thank you for sacrificing your tummy to entertain the masses on youtube. 🫡
the constant ptsd flashbacks of rainforest cafe scenes are some of the funniest shit ive ever seen ngl
Props to the manager in that one Margaritaville that was closed but they made one exception
18:04 gazeboat
That manager that let you in late is the goat also why didn't you sit on the big chair?
I look forward to next year when you both visit every Medieval Times! 🤴 Muahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Your expressions bro, love ya
now go to every house in america
Hey Man, I met you at the rooftop bar in NYC… I almost asked you if you were making this video! You were super kind. Thanks for making these silly and fun videos :))
I cant wait for you two to visit every hard rock cafe in the world, including the 74 locations outside of the United States
Cool smiling dog
'I Jimmied a little too close to the sun' is an absolutely banger quote
Did he miss the Pensacola Beach, FL location?
i played at a jazz competition at the destin location. there were roaches and it was freezing, 10/10.
My uncle is retired and he lives in Margaritaville. I didn't even know that was possible
Pleaseeee do all the Hard Rock Cafes
im just saying, hard rock cafe.
So when are we getting the Hard Rock Cafe video?
Did … did I just watch a 59 minute video about margarita ville in one sitting ???
If only Thick44 could have seen this.
Wearing a "The Thing...?" tee. Purposefully pausing the videos at the worst time for blurry screenshots. Eddy. All reasons that this video is just amazing.
What a video
You drove through His Holiness Jimmy Buffet’s hometown (Pascagoula MS) and didn’t leave an offering.  I’m ashamed 😢.
At 9:47 if anyone is wondering what he's wearing it's a Textured Johnny Collar Sweater Polo by Abercrombie & Fitch (sold out currently on light brown color)
Margaritaville used to have a restaurant in New Orleans on Decatur in the French Quarter but it shut down years ago, think it was from a hurricane. That was my favorite place to sit and drink and snacking on the Tabasco Onion Rings. When you showed you were going to New Orleans I started getting excited thinking they reopened it :(
imagine seeing the coolest man in the world then being nominated for "Coolest Motha Fuckers on the Planet" in the same road trip
Bubba Gump next year? Lol
Every McDonald’s in the US and Canada please
Come on, Eddy, don't be a feet tease
How's about Bubba Gubba Shrimpy?
Okay but what about margaritaville at lanier islands outside atlanta? Full water park Buffet theme
Loved the video! There is actually a Margaritaville inside Miami international Airport so technically you didn’t eat at every one the US.
Damn, this video made me find out the local margaritaville closed 😢
Next you should do every Hard Rock Cafe
What about the air port margaritavilles
In Tennessee, my sister and i jumped off the top of that giant green zip line thingy and also Ive been on that Ferris wheel. I just wanted to share that. It’s a pretty cool Ferris wheel ride
This guy looks like cinnemon toast Ken from an alternate reality
I laughed
That ATL traffic is wild and I’m sorry South Carolina sucked. We don’t know better 😂
Here me out: Medieval Times. There are 10 locations, including one in Toronto. Godspeed.
I cried at the Atlanta margaritaville staff opening the kitchen back up to help you make your targets, idk why.
The alien 🍑!!!! 😂😂😂
Only chain left now is hard rock cafe
Another great video! Keep up the good work, Deep Eddy!
Now eat at every McDonalds.
Part 3: Eating at every McDonalds in the country
3 words Hard Rock Cafe
I think you gotta do dickies last resort next summer to complete the tropical tourist restaurants
You and Ted mispronouncing Biloxi is killing my poor Mississippian heart💀
This is how I find out they took out the Margaritaville in my state of CT lol
next stop: go to every Medieval Times in the US and Canadaaaaaa
Now do Cheesecake Factory
you shoulda got the hat
So next is Hard Rock Cafe right?
Hard Rock Cafe road-trip when?
alright now every hard rock
I’ve never stayed at an ashram but no doubt the Jimmy Buffett hotel is America’s closest home-grown equivalent
Can't wait for every Medieval Times Dinner Tournament in the country
Do Cracker Barrel and Cheesecake Factory!!
I have a feeling braden is your fbi agent
13:56 The odds for this are shockingly high, actually. As a Texan, we all go to every Buc-ee’s every day of our lives.
Atlantic City nj let’s goooooo. What a shit hole tho
Eddy… comedy comes in threes.
52:50 "You look lonely..."
watching the videos back to back, my favorite part is Mall of America scene with the contrast between ted's glorious awakening love of margaritaville and eddy's realization "the first time the thought crossed my mind... I might kill Ted"
'sity wok'
You guys should do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next!
Which Chain is Next
So whats the next chain resturaunt? toby Keif"s?
Your a legend
I’m so happy to see proper captions on such a long video!!!!!!!!!
Skipped the Margaritaville in Bossier city! But good video!
A month in margaritaville hell
Can’t wait until next year when you eat at every Medieval Times in the country
See you guys in 2024 when they go to all the hard rock cafes
Dare I say how about next year doing all of the Spring in the Blues across America
Am I the only one that has never heard of a Margaritaville despite living in a city with one?
Looking forward to a Hard Rock Cafe one of these lol 🤡
There’s something so primally terrifying yet totally expected about a Jimmy Buffett cult in Mississippi
How was the myrtle beach location? My hometown
Bubba Gump roadtrip next year?
I have also experienced the massive crashes of depression that can happen after day drinking, usually at Thanksgiving. We do dinner at noon and we tend to hit the wine pretty hard.
Seeing my hometown in fl in pier park was so weird 😭 I hope you enjoyed it!!!!
so how much for the unedited toes version
I NEED that shirt but it’s sold out in all sizes please restock 🥲
You guys should go to Every Joe’s Crab Shack
I'm honored that you guys sat at the same booth that I did in Atlanta
Dang just skipped right over Jacksonville Florida :/
14:52 amogus
9:18 im more interested in this museum now than im going to be about the rest of your video
I pretty sure Eddie’s emotional journey has mostly to do with the HUGE difference between a Margaritaville on an actual tropical beach, and a Margaritaville in a dying mall in Syracuse.
Y’all missed the one in Houston
Ah Myrtle Beach SC, i lived in SC. Went there on my birthday....just as we pulled into town July 6, 2001 happened. (look it up). Good news! Free room upgrade cause ours was trashed! :D
surprisingly i walked into this restaurant for the first time last month and still had no idea jimmy buffet had anything to do with this.
Excellent drama you fit around all of these visits. Other than an upset tummy some of the time, these restaurant visits were most likely actually quite mundane. It's a generic American Bistro. How great can it really be?  Now do Hard Rock Cafe! 😉There are 34 of them.
Went to universal Orlando and the moment I saw Margaritaville at city walk, didn’t eat theyre but I saw it and had a massive grin on my face as a reminder to two of my favorite content creators dedicating a whole road trip across the United States and Canada for just these restaurants, love you and Ted so much
LMAO i went on that dr seuss ride when i was a kid and i remember being terrified 😭😭
I recently passed by all those thing signs and am glad I didn’t waste my time
20:23 yah I'm with you, I'm from upstate NY where we get some if the highest snow fall in the country, and I still prefer driving in the snow vs the rain cause i can at least see the snow. I work night shift and rain just makes everything darker
I have strong core memories of my Grandma taking me and my brother to the Margaritaville in Cleveland. This was still when you could smoke in bars. We got sat and were the only ones in the non smoking eating section. Across the restaurant was a bar full of nearly 15 old men just ripping cigs. Even when being across the restaurant, the smoke was a thick fog that coated our kids meals like the grease that was already on them. Pretty sure that’s the reason I have asthma today
You guys looked like a midwest emo band in Chicago hahah
Now visit every Texas Roadhouse in the US and greater Canada area.
Great. Now go to all the Hard Rock's.
It is so hilarious to me that the MOA has both the Rain Forest Cafe and the Margaritaville right across from each other
commit to the bit and do hard rock cafe next
For anyone wondering, the epic song in the background at 51:30 is Jungle Thrill by Bonnie Grace. I had to take the audio and split the tracks apart to find out I needed to know so badly.
I know so many people who work at the Lake Conroe one and apparently it’s a shit show
we cant keep letting him get away with this
Maybe it's the 40 year old Dad in me, but dude you're gonna DESTROY your BLOWHOLE.
theres a margaritaville in phx🙃
Ohohoho the possibilities of this series are endless - Benihana  - Hooters - Chuck E. Cheese - medevial times - Hard Rock Cafe - more that im prob forgetting And honestly I cant decide which one I want to see most lmao
This is awesome. In my 20s, I used to have wacky adventures with my friends. Now I am near 40 with all these responsibilities and kids. I lived vicariously through this.
The Biloxi Margaritavile is so Jimmy heavy because he was born and raised on the gulf coast. He’s like our biggest claim to fame
I was literally thinking, “wouldn’t it be funny if he got food poisoning from the very first restaurant”. Then you got (mildly) sick. Lol
Hard Rock Cafe next?
Time to do Medieval Times! Don't worry there's only 10! The last one is in Toronto in a government building :)
Hard Rock Cafe
Hard rock cafe next year
1560 CALORIES!!?!?!?!?!?!
Next do every Joe’s Crab Shack in the US and Canada(?)
I've been to that rainforest cafe in san antonio in 2011 (or when ever my cousin Mark got married). I'm from the uk.
When I was a kid there used to be a Margaritaville Mexican restaurant in my hometown that had to change their name after Jimmy Buffett sued them over the copyright of "Margaritaville".
@EddyBurback Eddy, you should do Bubba Gump (23), Wahlburgers (31), Tommy Bahama (17 excluding Hawai'i) or Rock Bottom (11) next year!
do every bubba gump in the country next
I feel personally attacked
I freaking lost it at the green m&m part 😂
Cant wait for you to go to every tim hortons in canada in maybe 20 years.
Bubba Gump Co. Tour When
Hard rock next PLEASE
best way i've ever heard biloxi pronounced
do you explore each other carnally
Every McDonald’s next
50:44 Chad alpha based energy
I just discovered you can't wait to go back and looking forward to new content.  Very funny and clever.
incredible
We need a trilogy
this is free will!
You skipped Missouri Margaritaville! You have accomplished nothing!!!
Will you be visiting the new Boston location when it's done? Because once that opens you will no longer have eaten at every Margaritaville location in the US and Canada.
Next up: Eddy and Ted go to every Medieval Times in the country
I’m currently at the original one. (We went to the same college Eddie)
Can you go all medieval times?
GOTTA LOVE YOUTUBE... where else can you watch some dork review Margarittaville locations.  Seriously who watches this shit?  What a waste of internet.
You're going to go to every Buc-ee's in the country next, aren't you...
I might kill Ted lolol! Homicidal ideation at its best…clearly tongue in cheek, right? ❤😂
Dollywood sweeps needs to happen
Bubba Gump next >:)
32:04 legend
The beeeeaaaaaaaaan 🫘🫘🫘🫘🫘🫘 🫘
Casa Bonita next
9000 miles probably more omg y’all are crazy 😂🎉
Now do a “I ate at every McDonald’s in the Country”
Eat at every Cheesecake Factory 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Have you ever been to a Stew Leonards?
Hard Rock Cafe is next right? Lol
*almost* every Margaritaville in the country. Capitola, California baby!
44:46 SKFKSKFDKJC Eddy looks so traumatized after leaving the store 😭
Just found this channel. Its really hard to unsee that he is not wearing fake glasses with an attached mustache..
entering Florida and then running a sponsored ad for a product that's _prohibited_ in Florida was a hilarious move.
those “ neighborhoods” are hotels 😭😭 i stayed in one for my 17th birthday a year ago
OMG I don’t know how the one in Syracuse stays open 😂 no one is ever there always a ghost town when I walk by. Rather it from the food court 😂
Yeah I wouldn’t get jambalaya in the north…
2024… Bubba Gump. 😈
EYY BILOXI
It's my sleepover, I get to pick the movie.
Eddy, Pro tip for when your at  Buc-ees.  If you don’t want to lose Ted get one of those animal backpacks you put on toddlers my friends have one for me. They use it all the time it has a leash on it too it’s perfect so you don’t lose us.
Went to the Margaritaville in Universal Orlando today because of these videos. My heart was shattered, stomped on, grinded, and snorted by Mr. Buffet himself. The ceviche was sub par, the lava shrimp was packing enough sauce, and my gf was begging me to go to a different restaurant. I didnt feel like i was in Margaritaville, i felt like i was stranded in the forest, frustrated, and tired. All there is left to do is go to Atlanta for a change in altitude/attitude
2024: "I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the Country."  There's only 23 locations in the US and Canada! 🦐🇺🇲🇨🇦
do olive garden next
Alot drinking and driving going on here😂
the better question is why the hell did I just watch that entire thing.
Rock n Roll Cafe next year.
what will be next year's restaurant?
Now we need every hard rock cafe
You were not at the one in Mercer PA😑
Do McDonald’s
I can’t wait for you guys to go to every Buc-ees next year (I’m manifesting so hard)
I am genuinely concerned for this man
Do Hard Rock Cafe next!
you should go to every “dicks last resort”
Next up, a tour of hard rock cafe
You went all the way to south Florida and didn’t stop for a trip on the Margaritaville at Sea??
Can't wait for the Bubba Gump road trip of 2024
Do Cracker Barrel next 😅
i've never been to magaritaville or heard of it before but i am definitely going to watch all of this
Next year Eddie should come to the UK and do a tour of all the Weatherspoons
The legends are back together 😂
inb4 hard rock cafe
I was just in Pigeon Forge, I love that area of Tennessee, I can go enjoy nature during the day and unwind in town at night
6:35 in and thinking about your tummy
Eddie, do McDonald’s   You will die
The real question is why they are not buffets.
Insert your own joke about Bert Kreischer here
Now go to every McDonald's in the country. And Canada
Definitely need to do Bubba Gino Shrimp Co or Joes Crab Shack or possibly Planet Hollywood next.
Do all Texas Roadhouse
28:04 margaritaville is so antiquated people walk backwards in time
you need to eat at every mr beast burger in the country
Achievement unlocked  Margaritaville Master
It is a crime you didn't go to the Margaritaville in Daytona Beach, FL
im loving these!
Hopefully next time your foray into Canada is more than just Niagra Falls. Not that the falls are bad, but they're on the border y'know?
do Wetherspoons in the UK
You didn't go to all of them.. You skipped Jacksonville.
So there are 93 Benihanas in the US...
Next year should be every Medieval Times 😌
My third time watching now and I love how wholesome both of these videos have been, hard rock has to be next though lol
You gotta do Bubba Gumps now.
Dude, you completely skipped Palm Springs! So no, you didnt go to every location. Instead you cut that part out to show us some tacky roadside bs. Tisk tisk.
Back when I was kid in Arizona we'd always stop at The Thing whenever we were driving on I10. It used to just be a brick room with a mummified indian in it, I guess they had to build the museum at some point to justify keeping it 😂
Okay but like do hardrock cafe next?
10:10
You totally missed out by not making it to Dollywood
whatever genre this video and safiya nygaard staying at every las vegas hotel is, I want more of it
Thank you so much for the chance
29:08 moon
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company  Bubba Gump Shrimp Company  Bubba Gump Shrimp Company  Bubba Gump Shrimp Company  Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
Turned out the Dolphins were on a timed motor.
Woohoo!
Y’all need to do every margaritaville in the world. They seem to all be in gorgeous areas: Turks and Caicos, Bermuda, Jamaica ect
Petition to make Eddy and Ted spend a year going to every single Chuck E Cheese across America to celebrate the new FNAF movie.
That rental needs some rain-x
YOU CAME TO PANAMA ?????? WHAT I MISSED U FUCKKKKKK
Hope you enjoyed the MS Gulf Coast!!!!
not suprised if the next trip is the hardrock cafe
Hard Rock Cafe next
now he has to do all the bubba gump shrimp companies!!!
Next up: Every Hard Rock Cafe in the US!
There’s also Air Margaritaville inside Miami International Airport and Detroit Metropolitan Airport which would've made for an interesting segment of the trip as they are past security.
this is so stupid.
$20 next year it’s hard rock cafe
This was so much fun! So entertaining and creative!
they missed the margaritaville in lake lanier
17:31
Y’all such a cute couple
This series keeps getting better. See you next year!
You gotta let us know if the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. is next
I don't understand why you plan so stringently. What could be fun and entertaining is instead miserable and frustrating to even watch.
Amazed jimmy buffet hasnt seen the vid
Next year Every Medieval Times, Hooters or Hard Rock Cafe 😂😂
Next year should be Hard Rock
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next!
Bubba gump shrimps
Hard rock hotel next
I hate to have to bring this to your attention, but there is a Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio. It's the original, and it does count as a credit.
that florida man dancing when they got to miami ahhahaha
You should do dicks last resort next
Now do Bubba Gump Shrimp
Clearly, the only thing left is to go to all 34 international Hard Rock Cafe
Hard Rock Cafe when?
So Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next 😂😂😂
Please do McDonald’s next
Next up: the ridiculous amount of horrible HardRock Cafes
i still think its really funny how the whole point of the Margaritaville song is that he's a drunk and a fuckup and lonely, but then a bunch of drunk lonely fuckups completely missed the point, so Jimmy decided to cash in and take their drunk lonely fuckup money with restaurants themed around being such
I met Pete Doherty in 2017 in Sao Paulo airport at the Margaritaville...he was with the band The Puta Madres and they had a giant pitcher of margarita... We had a drink we chit chatted, I told him he was the n2 idol of my teenage year and I hurt his feelings telling him Jarvis Cocker was the N1. Thank you Jimmy Buffett, you make dreams come true 😘
Bro 52:07 absolutely broke me i love those jumps into narrative style moments they crack me up so much💀💀💀
It would be hilarious if you did all the Hard Rock Cafe locations.
One of my best memories with my mom was seeing a Christmas performance in the city that lasted until around 10pm. We were hungry after and the only thing we could do was go to the margaritaville in the san antonio. It was awesome. The service was great. They had a talented live performer. The food was so-so but not too over priced. I don't ever want to go back
This is a very foot-centric video.
this was so pointless lmao but i loved it
Next up every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
do i get to see his feet if i pay for his patreon
Eddy, I sent you an Email
Now go to every McDonalds in America.
brooo they went and saw the thing, i live in new mexico and i've only been there once myself and it was back when the thing was a mummy, i didnt know they changed it to this.
Watching this as an European feels like I'm looking into an alternate dimension because good lord what is going on.
who the hell is jimmy buffet
Blade runner green m&m blade runner green m&m
I know I’ve spent too much time in Binghamton when I can recognize the parking lot where you picked up Spencer 😂
Now go to every theme park in America
Next step, go to all the Margaritavilles and Rainforest Cafes in the world.
next every Cracker Barrel???
As someone who lives in Syracuse, it's not a surprise at all that Destiny Mall wasn't up to par. There are regular shootings in/around that mall
so refreshing and engaging, thanks!
To see this trip from 2 perspectives makes it even better!
You should have stopped by the 'original' margaritaville in Sandusky. You would have been pleasantly surprised!
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next! 😂
You should do this concept, but with fudruckers, and invite me (a total stranger) to go with you
How where you able to survive the last trip with the basketball sized hole in the floor on the passenger side right near your feet.
People are gonna say Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. will complete the trilogy...but it should be The Cheesecake Factory.
A little west of Sandusky Ohio, there was a place on SR 2 and US6 is "The Original Margaritaville".  One that well in existed before Jimmy Buffett made his restaurants.    Did you know about that place?
They are opening one in Lake Tahoe!!!
Can’t wait for the bubba gump shrimp video
2:52 my band played there a couple nights before the rose parade in 2023, I can’t believe that our band director didn’t tell us it was a historical monument
How is there not a Margaritaville in San Diego?  LA to Phoenix drive f*ckin sucks! Came back from Universal Studios myself and it sucked. Phoenix to El Paso no treat either! Hit a massive sandstorm like I did?😂
Definitely missed the Margaritaville resort in the lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.
its insane how different it is to watch the same journey but from a different POV
Now it is time to conquer all Hard Rock Cafe's, all 185 all across the globe.
If in another year we see the hard rock cafe tour, don't order burgers. they're always burnt
He also cameoed in _Jurassic World_ (2015), when the Pteranodons attack, there's shot of him grabbing two Margaritas and running away. It's because he's good mates with Frank Marshall (Producer and Spielberg's right hand man), years ago he sang the end credits song to his movie _Arachnophobia_ (1990), titled _Don't Bug Me_
next you should do every bubba gump shrimp company
Eddy: "FINS UP JIMMY!"  Me: "Oh, I think he's joining a cult"
This just makes me think of the hotel california
Dick's Last Resort next there's only like 10 locations!
2024: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for when they go back to Bloomington MN and they realize they are all 3 right next to each other.
working for margaritaville was an absolute corporate nightmare that ultimately cost me more to be there than i typically made. they’re also pathetically loyal to the possibility of him making an appearance once in their lifetime ??
So next year you guys are going to all the Bubba Gump locations, right? there are 22 in north america.
your rainforest cafe video was the funniest thing ever so im so happy to see a sequel
Not even talking about the Belvidier Oasis... smh
If you ever do this concept again and you get to Texas and dont run into Brayden you need to turn around and go home
I enjoy these videos so much.
Did you guys do this before the South Padre Island, TX margaritaville opened?
that’s cool and all but where’s the hard rock cafe road trip?
Someone from Mississippi mispronounced Biloxi, imagine my shock.
this is the best sequel i have ever seen
I say every Hard Rock Cafe in North America is next year
Go to a Starbucks in every state and get the state mugs :)
This is textbook gonzo journalism
should let your beard and chest hair grow till they touch.
Next do all McDonald’s in the US
A couple buddies and I were just at Destiny USA mall and stopped by Margaritaville after seeing this video. Originally, it was just to get margaritas since the food didnt look good but after a bit we decided to eat lunch as well saying "well how bad can it be?".The answer to that is pretty fucking bad. Easily one of the worst meals I've had and the margaritas were shit too. Jimmy, you took $40 from me that I will never get back, we all regretted eating there after everything was done. Never again Jimmy, never again.
eat at dick’s last resort next
Wait, why did you not go to the one in Conroe Texas?
why would you rent a truck and not a van or SUV?
huli huli is pronounced [quickly] "who-ee who-ee" :)
I just thought of this but now u have to do medieval times
28:48
Shout out the only one in my state  Guessing the place is all  atmosphere and less food like hard rock cafe
Cool now do Hard Rock Cafe
oh my god my boyfriend bought your shirt and i didnt realize it was your merch until just now. he literally will not stop wearing it and im starting to think he might never
Literally spotted my grandparents in the Tulsa clips
Cant unsee that the pins on the map looks like the head of Samus Aran
IM GEEKING CAUSE I TOO HAD A TUMMY ACHE FROM MARGARITAVILLE
can’t wait for you to go to the new margaritaville they’re building down the street from my house because we need more of them
There's a reason the one in the Phoenix area closed. It was terrible.
Next is Bubba Gump!
I feel like you gotta do ooooone more next year. Make it a trilogy.
22:10 legit goat simulator npc 💀💀💀💀
Im expecting Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for next year now.
Should do Hardrock Cafe and wear your best Dad attire to each one
Bro didn't go to the Lake Lanier Margaritaville😢
i’m starting to think eddy might be a masochist…
Hard Rock Cafe…
Y’all should do Cracker Barrel next! Haha
Do Hard Rock Cafe next!
Now stay at every ramada inn
Jimmy Buffet, Hunter S Thompson and Ed Bradley would meet each year down in New Orleans to take Molly and party all weekend. That's a pretty interesting trio to run into on a pub crawl.
eat at every McDonalds next
I think the logical next step is Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 22 locations in the US… you know you want to 😂
Didn’t you not go to the Tusla one??
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next?
That kid absolutely sucked at stinky feet
Dude really was pulling off that hat though.
What about south Padre island
Sorry to tell you but I skipped ahead to where you got to my part of the woods (ATL area) and if I'm not mistaken it looks like you might of missed two locations. One at Lake Lanier in Georgia and another in Gatlinburg, TN. I only know of these locations first hand because I live 5 minutes away from the former and my girlfriend lives 40 minutes away from the latter and I've been to both in the last month. Like I said, maybe I missed something, but if not, is there any particular reason you excluded them from your roadtrip? Trust me when I say that they are two areas that absolutely deserve a place in a cross country roadtrip, especially if your target "stops" are the restaurants based out of them.
Next year you should do bubba gump shrimp co.
Hard Rock Cafe is next
Can't wait for Bubba Gumps
Ok. Now do Bubba Gump.
Man you did cleveland so dirty, it’s on the river in our east flats district. You couldn’t have even shown the skyline behind it
Now go to every hard rock café🙂
Did you get an AIDSburger in paradise?
Do every Hard Rock Cafe. The jokes will write themselves.
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT! my actual childhood. we are begging, eddy. i need to see you crumble under the impossibly loud music & dark interiors that make you feel like you’re blind. Please
Jimmy Buffet is an actual billionaire thanks to Margaritaville.
Cool of the employee and manager to let you in! Awesome video!
Now do macdonalds
I have watched this video toooo many times for this video to have been released two weeks ago
From the UK and are those prices regular for US restrunts, that's insane 25 dollas for a small bit of fish and 12 dollas for a margareeter? I'd take one look at teh menu and do a 180 and walk out lol.
You actually didn’t go to every Margaritaville there’s another one in Conroe, Texas 😔😔
Holy ish dude, do u hear yourself?? Boo hoo, I got paid to travel the country eat at a restaurant every night. Fn wah dude. GTFOH. U know there's ppl sleeping in filth, barely eating n paying for it all. Plus ur young, miss me w that "sore tummy" n "tired". Dude so many ppl would look forward to n enjoy this as a vacation. Myself included.  Also, "I don't see how Jimmy could do it? " Well,  lemme tell u, it's called being a man.
I was in San Antonio back in April and we tried going to the Margarita on two different occasions for just drinks and an appetizer and they had crazy wait times despite being only about a quarter full on both occasions. On top of that, the place was pretty nasty (just like in your video).  My guess is that joint is on life support and won't be with us much longer.  Soon to join the Margaritas in Paradise.
Now you have too go to Every margarittaville Air all 5 of them every airport
can't wait for next year when you eat at every mcdonald's in the country
The epic intro ending with "im thinking we're in Margaritaville i dunno about you!" is so funn.
Why?
After you take a year or two off, I vote you go to Every Bubba Gumps. If not, this was a really cool series. Good on ya!
Now hit up every McDonalds in the USA and Canada >=3
This is such a loser reddit pandering video. Total neckbeard superiour than though nonsense. I wish I could give it a million downvotes
There are feature-length movies produced by multibillion dollar studios that failed to engage me as much as this video
Look at that mustache.
was not expecting nakey jakey in there
I can’t believe I actually watched the entire thing  🙃
Please do the Dollywood sidequest next time.
jimmy buffet looks like pierce from community
Who wants to bet he does Hard Rock Cafe next year.
But what about the Orlando airport location? 😂
THE BEAN! YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You didnt even record the giant margarita hurricane ACTIVATED in Myrtlr Beach. Smh.
Escape samsara via Margaritaville
i fell asleep while watching this and it felt like a fever dream
Jarvis suddenly being in there caught me off guard XD
Bro is stealing Ted Nivison’s content
Staring into the bean like Sphere
Eddy's going to go crazy one of these days and go to every McDonalds in every universal dimension.
One opening in Boston soon
Now visit all McDonald's restaurants 😂
I am sorry sir, I couldn't pay attention to this video. All I could see was that hypnotic mustache.......
Ah of course, T. Binkley Prince, Tee Grizzley's royal relative...
My favorite part about this is that your thumbnail was sitting on my TV when my wife and I sat down on our couch to eat dinner. She was in shock that I watch your videos without her knowing, because apparently you went to elementary, middle, and high school together.
The Florida Keys location does look pretty nice TBH.
Y’all should go to every Bubba Gump restaurant next year
Bubba Gump next year?🦐
That was wild but I just flew out of Fort Lauderdale airport and there is a margaritaville inside the airport.
I bet you're glad they closed the one in Glendale, AZ.  Heck, I thought it was still open until you didn't go there & I googled why you didn't go there.
i used to drive from Los Angeles to El Paso  every summer when I was a kid and we always stopped at The Thing, it was a whole lot shittier 20-15 years ago lol what it is now is actually a major improvement hahaha
Next year: I ate at every Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Co in the country
Fear & Loathing in Margaritaville©️
Where did Margaritaville in Glendale, AZ go? That's the only one I've ate at. 2011 I believe. lol
Now eat at every McDonald's
Tulsa for the win!
Best Jimmy Buffet quote: "My head hurts, my feet stink, and I don't love Jesus."
watching this video makes me feel sick xD
please do another
Great video! Can’t wait to visit The Thing?. Can’t even believe they allow cameras in there
MEDIEVAL TIMES NEXT 👀 there’s 10
It takes until 52 minutes into the video. But I'm very glad he said now. Hes wasting away in margaritaville.
The title is a lie.  I don’t see the New Orleans location on your map…
Petition for you to ALSO go on the Margaritaville cruise
Are we getting a Bubba Gump Shrimp tour too?
So, wanna do Bubba Gumps Next year?
The RF Cafe PTSD is gold
That’s great, now do Bubba Gump Shrimp.
Yall didn’t go to Margaritaville in Bossier City, Louisiana. Ive been there. A casino and over crowded pool. You didn’t miss anything. Lol
anyone know where i can find that shirt at 52:11
I was in Panama City,FL earlier this year….we loved it!…the fried fish was worth the trip alone👍
Next destinations: Hard Rock Cafe!
There’s some Margaritavilles in airports that ya’ll missed, but I’ll allow it.
Imagine if margaritaville had an All you can eat Jimmy Buffet. I liked when the volcano burped :).
4:25 nice also, 7 min and 42 secs in im already loving you. had never seen anything from you before. funny
Cat in the hat ride🤝boat scene from Charlie and the chocolate factory
The 2 little boys were paid actors
One time I ate at margarita ville, and it took a lengthy wait time of 2 hours or so, and the food gave my mom, and almost my entire family but me food poisoning.
May I suggest cracker barrel next.
https://youtu.be/Mrft8Kf8MfI  She knew.
Ha! Final! I'll be waiting for the next.  How in the fuck are you old enough to grow that glorious mustache.. but you'd Never heard of Spencer's Gifts?
Coolest mfs in the planet😂
ah in at 44:36 i happy my home town was when you started to mentally break down
Bro…the toe pixelation KILLED ME 😂🤣🤣 funniest video I’ve seen in a while!
Hope youre ready for the cheesecake factory road trip.
what’s the song at 1:50 called?
Eddy is amazing
crazy seeing where i work in an eddy burback video. even crazier that i never saw him
my ass lives in key west
0:44 should’ve said North America. I feel like it’s more impressive to say all on one continent than countries
This video really helps when I’m at the gym and feeling like I wanna quit because Eddy didn’t quit and neither will I
It would be cool to fuse this and the Ted's video into a bigger one, seeing the two perspectives in the same video
can't wait to see Ted's pov
If this is the new thing where you pay Youtube to promote your shit, I'm done with this platform. I've repeatedly marked this crap as not interesting and to not recommend the channel, yet this video still pops up in my feed.
Next year be like we are going to go to every McDonald's in North America.
He should get his gallbladder and cholesterol checked wooohweee this is raisin my blood pressure
Getting locked in the bathroom is definitely something that would happen to me
What made you decide. 1m followers utube and ad pay for 3 weeks 😂
The Chicago clips were so Chicago 😂😂
Yeah okay I need more info on the alien and dinosaur thing
i cant believe you didn't order the jumbalaya while  in New Orleans
52:53 - you look lonely... I can fix that...
Running out of ideas? What's coming next, "I ate at every Golden Corral"?
YOU DIDNT GO TO THE ONE IN THE OZARKS WTF THATS WHY I WATCHED THIS ENTIRE VIDEO
I’m sad we’ll never get a Hard Rock Cafe road trip.
That's the most robust moustache I've ever seen in my life.
Girl you didn't get to go to the new one at SPI, Texas!
Do you need to do the cruise now? 😇
Please give us three hours of you drunkenly ranting about TV commercials from our childhood again 😢
If you get tired of doing restaurants I think you should do something like all of the pirates cove mini golf courses in America or something
After having just watched a hour and a half of two people going to margaritaville, I am tempted to try one lol. I really liked your narrative Eddy, Teds made me laugh, and so did yours, but you had so many details that were missing from his end. I’m glad I watched them both, thank you for your service
46:40
Final time? Eddy, you clearly haven't heard of the rule of three. Next year at medieval times!
Petition for eddy to go to Dollywood
“Going to every buc-ee’s in America”
From a fellow road warrior this is one of the funniest things I've watched in a long time
PETITION FOR THE SUGAR FACTORY TO BE NEXT YEARS! (24 locations in the US)
this video is so funny it makes me laugh so hard! i will binge watch your videos now you are very cool 👍
How much do I have to pay to unlock the toes
Other restarunats you could do, Hard rock cafe, probably not cheesecake factory but definitely something vintage obscure like roy rogers.
This is peak postmodernism. Is Eddy being sarcastic? Is he being sincere? Yes! Is Margaritaville a fine, fun little restaurant that celebrates island vibes and easy living, or is it a late capitalist nightmare that symbolizes the last drop of blood squeezed from the stone of the American dream? ALSO YES!!!
I’m excited about their next “we ate at every Joe’s Crab Shack” video. I always wondered who “Joe” was.
Can I ask a real question? No hate. Great video!   But why the fuck are they driving a truck for a cross country road trip? Especially because they literally CHOSE to rent one this time? Your stuff gets left outside and horrible fuel efficiency. It makes no sense.
Next year do hard rock
Having grown up in Biloxi (of which Eddy absolutely butchered the pronunciation lmao) I just figured every Margaritaville had a giant arcade in them. My old high school would take yearly field trips as an incentive to sell raffle tickets for the school auction. Never thought I’d see the day Eddy came to my hometown
The Atlanta location was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.
Someone time stamp Chicago for me lol
as someone who grew up with boomers who LOVE jimmy and are parrot heads (okay that's what they call themselves) I get all the references and can finish the lyrics and I... I feel sad.
Can’t wait for the next one!!
HARD ROCK CAFE
Lol the only one I've been to is the shitty Syracuse one.
You don’t like Buckee? Erm…
Omg the cat in the hat ride was my sons’ and my nieces’ favourite ride 10 years ago when they were 8-11 years old. It’s one of the only things they remember from our 12 day trip to Florida lol
I doubt even Jimmy Buffet's been to every Margaritaville.
Man, you got a really pretty girlfriend. Can I have her number when you die of liver disease?
I feel happily represented as a person from Tulsa. Thank you for not mentioning the river in which Margaritaville resides. It’s atrocious.
Why the fuck does this have 5 million views. People will watch paint dry lol
Bubba Gump shrimp should be next!
I just don't get why he didn't start a buffet chain
26:26
you guys should go to every single hard rock cafe 👀
Eddy is me the first time I rode the cat in the hat ride. Quickly became a fascination for me when I lived in FL with my universal pass
I want to offer you a sincere congratulations on your accomplishment!  I eagerly await your next adventure.. perhaps Pf Chang's?
I think the next restaurant should be, "Bubba Gump Shrimp."
Time for the hard rock cafe? Lol that or bubba gumps
MFW I recognize when the boys are in Wisconsin purely by the landscape
Keep doing this and keep racking up the challenge till you get to somthing like every burger king in america that one will take you a 5 years alone.
I was so excited to see this video to watch Ted and Eddy react to the Margaritaville in Mohegan Sun Casino where I went so many times growing up. Only to find out that it closed since I moved out of CT. These videos are classics though. Cant wait for the next chain adventure!
Bubba Gump next year pls
Did I miss you visiting the Capitola location??
Next is every applebees
We stopped at "The Thing" on tour in 2017. Looks like it changed a lot since I was last there... and of course... Buc'ees a tour staple as well...
Next, go to every waffle house
Next needs to be Hard Rock Cafe!!
Fun fact about Jimmy's plane at the Orlando City Walk. The Government of Jamaica mistook them for drug runners and attempted to shoot them down. You can see the very real bullet holes along the side of the plane. It is the inspiration for the song Jamaica Mistaica.
Man turn around you skipped the Jurassic World location!
Ted has the most intact hairline I've ever seen on a man
So glad Canada gave you a good experience!! Thanks for stopping by, eh!
So next year we doing hard rock or what?
Missed the Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio
this is a weird way to learn I live near one of these restaurants.
next up: hard rock cafe
TIM MISNY MAKING AN APPEARANCE IS VERY CLEVELAND
If you really wanna get crazy, go to every Johnny Rockets in the country!
Lol, i use to work at the one at universal citywalk LA. You get to eat lunch behind the waterworld show, pretty sick times. Also the chemistry you and Ted have is great.
Surely the next series ought to be Medieval Times
Now we need a Hard Rock Cafe world tour please
terrible idea, but you should eat at every Hardrock cafe in the US and Canada
pronounced Buhlucksy
You've got to go to dollywood in the future 😂
Only on YouTube would this exist and for that i am grateful.. so what’s next years restaurant .?
THE THING! I used to drive from CA to TX with my family and we would always stop at the thing. It used to be super cheap, some artifacts and then you end up at the mummy. A few years ago they must've gotten funding and totally rehauled everything. There was NOTHING about aliens or anything conspiracy related in the original. No idea where they came up with all this stuff. pretty hilarious. living in the middle of the desert will make you crazy I guess
There’s a margaritaville in Galveston that opened a few months ago lmao
By the way, the fish and chips were just good lololo
Good
It’s so freaky seeing somewhere I go frequently in a video like this. As a kid, I would go to the Pigeon Forge area with the Ferris wheel often. It’s just freaky hearing someone like Eddy talk about it
I remember “the thing?” When I did a road trip in 2015. Memories
Just realized Jimmy Buffett is not the same person as warren Buffett.
So now you're going to do Bubba Gumps right?
As someone who has destiny USA as a local mall      sorry   Very sorry
Hard Rock Cafe is next... probably
I've been to the pier park one a few times! Good food! Good drinks!
Ya missed San Diego
Does Eddy actually sell foot pics?
This might sound like torture knowing you’ve done this twice already but you should definitely visit every hard rock in the country. It’s way more challenging since there’s a bunch of more locations.
You guys missed a margaritaville in lake of the ozarks 😆
next year you should go to every bubba gump
Do Hard Rock Cafes next!
Missed one in missouri
As a Mississippi native, I’m amazed that someone mentioned our state without any criticism😂
Absolutely brilliant editing, and I wanted to commend your audio mixing. There wasn't a moment of inappropriate loudness, nor of inaudible quieteness. Mwah. Looks like you had a lot of fun, bunch of hilarious moments in here and I learned a lot too surprisingly
I live in Syracuse I can confirm it’s crap but then again nobody ask them to put one in the mall literally no one goes there
Watching Eddy fall farther and farther into the cult of margarita ville and Jimmy Buffet
I bet you guys had some incredible conversations on the road tho
cant wait for them to do this again next year !
Ted has the same vibes as a guinea pig
Wait, what about the location on Broadway in Nashville?!
So where’s he going next summer?
it would be amazing if jimmy watched this video
that cat in the hat ride reminds me of the winnie the pooh ride at disney land which also traumatized me as a kid. who’s out here deciding to make these rides so god damn scary? lmao
Welcome to atlanta lol
the Bucees rule is every man for himself, go back to the car once you buy your stuff. no chance you're finding any of your friends in there
He wasted away in margaritaville
Just started the video, Eddy better not say some shit like "Margharitaville isn't just a place, it's a state of mind" or I will lose it.
What’s next year? Hard Rock Cafe? Bubba Gump?
Do Culver’s next
2 days to elpaso??? weak....... :O Ive done that three times in one shot.
Sorry to tell you this but you skipped Margaritaville in Palm Springs. So you haven’t been to every Margaritaville in the US.
Next up do Hard Rock Cafe
I saw a margaritaville cruise ship in palm beach 😭
Next year you two should go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S. there is currently 34, the content possibilities are just boiling.
Hit hardcore traffic on the way to Atlanta. Sounds about right
Can’t wait for the Cheesecake Factory video next year
What about the margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach
"rain is slippery and dangerous" Aww, your California is showing.
My parents have been taking me to Jimmy Buffett concerts almost every year since I was 3 years old and I can safely say that's the closest to religion my family ever got
Hard Rock Cafe next!
I got a swiffer ad at the end 💀
Another double Margaritaville day 😂
I have a feeling Bubba Gump Shrimp is next
JImmy's Jammin' Jambalaya right after diarrhea = Best. Idea. Ever.
Why not get the jambalaya in Louisiana?
Wait we have one here in Virginia  Dont see it on the map there!!!
hahahaha yesss "The Thing!" classic
its pronounced biluxy not bill oxy
When did eddy turn into a food reviewer? Both trips and the ghost kitchen thing…
How do I upgrade my moustache to Burback level?
I long to have a road trip as epic as your Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville conquests.
Themed restaurants are one of my favorites guilty pleasures
Are you going to the grand opening of the Boston location?
Do a face reveal
Soo whats the next restaurant that’s on the agenda
I will love to see Jimmy giving a review of this video and having a meeting with his team 🤪
My freshman year of high school I walked around the river walk with no shoes on so uhh that’s my legacy in San Antonio ig
Do Denny's
As a long-time Arizona resident, big salute to The Thing.  When I first moved here, they still had the cars and the mummy, but that was all.  The whole aliens-out-of-Sumerian-mythology thing got added sometime later, I only found out about it when I was coming back from a road trip with my youngest and they wanted to stop and see it.
If I remember correctly, the pane in Orlando has a bullet hole? I forgot how I learned but its there.
hard rock cafe next
You skipped one. There's one here in Daytona
CINEMA!
You’re gonna have to do these videos at least once a year now
7:07 The Offcanny merch thoo
Do ON THE BORDER NEXT
Gotta do every bubba gump shrimp co next
I was hoping he would do the one on the cruise ships too
WOOOO SYRACUSE IS THE WORST ONE LETS GOOOOO CUSE CUSE CUSE
Holy crap those prices, how can anyone afford to eat there?
hard rock cafe next
But did you go to the margaritaville on the Margaritaville Cruise ship?
Good
Bubba Gump Shrimp next!
Wonderful moment
It would make sense to do Bubba Gump Shrimp next...similar number of locations, very similar vibes
Another incredible video. I had no idea that Margaritaville was that huge in the US. Resorts, Hotels, Casinos etc .
We used to have a cheeseburger in paradise (Jimmys second restaurant chain) in my city. I remember it being amazing shame it closed back in 2013 or 2014
Green M&M: "You look lonely, I can fix that" Blade Runner 2049 moment @ 52:51
I vote for bubba gump shrimp next year
I'm sorry for your wallet.
Sir Edward of house Burback, I regret to inform you that your quest is not over. There is one more adversary that you must conquer. I, as messenger of the vicar of Christ and bishop of Rome, Pope Francis himself, am acting under orders from Heaven to inform you that it is your holy duty to visit all 10 Medieval Times restaurants in North America (9 in US, 1 in Canada). This crusade is the only way to save your undying soul and secure your place in the Kingdom of Heaven. Deus Vult!
He did, in fact, pull off that hat
I don't know why...
1080p a true viewer experience.
Sooo, next year Planet Hollywood? Hardrock Cafe the year after? 😂
Is there a reason Margaritaville at Lanier Islands wasn't included?
Got goosebumps when you were looking out to the sea. What a video my guy what a video lil Eddy boy!
honestly watching this makes me want to do this but i can't think of an equivalent UK chain... at least not one that doesn't have 169 locations 😅
Cross country road trips are one of the most fun things in the world and everyone should do one at some point in their life.
Been to that Margaritaville and on that Ferris Wheel and my reaction was the same!
what grown man says "my tummy"?
Eddy, you gotta try Hard Rock Cafes next…there’s only like….twenty eight of them left, I think…you’ll go completely insane (but, hey, you’d get to come down to San Diego, so, there’s THAT)
52:48 is literally me
go 2 evry mcdonla
This man has traumatic jungle flashbacks like Robin Williams in Jumanji
whats next
17:21 you're goin away for a long time pal. book him!
You KNOW NOTHING of the Coal Mines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There's a Margaritaville in the Miami Airport...looks like you need to go back!
Now do Subway? ;P
Was not expecting the schlatt jumpscare
cant wait to see "going to every cracker barrel" i think that would be cool
I didn't know who you were or anything about you before this video but I am glad I watched this. This was so entertaining.
It does not surprise me in the slightest that the Syracuse one was the worst lol. What a not good place in NY.
Now go to every Red Robin in the country
Sounds like it’s time to go international.
:) the Boston one opens this month
Does anyone realize how expensive Margaritaville is….Wow
YEEEAAAHHHHH TULSA REPRESENT!!!! LEAST BAD MARGARITAVILLE!! GAMBLING ADDICTION!!!! WOOOOOOOO GO OKLAHOMA!!!!
Jimmy Buffet is my best friend
"The second and final of these road trips!"......Until you do it again next year for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company XD.    I'm surprised you didnt mention how annoying "ITS HURRICAINE TIME!" gets in the Myrtle Beach location
Do bubba gump shrimp next
Go to every Bass Pro Shop in the country.
Do Hooters
In all honesty, as someone that have been living in Minnesota for a while, you got the most authentic Mall of America experience I have ever seen, it was only missing a shooting
So you just said screw it and just skip Jacksonville, FL. altogether.
I lived in PCB. Never ate at Margaritaville, though.
Cheesecake now
Do chuckey cheese next
Apparently that "The Thing!" exhibit had nothing to do with aliens or dinosaurs prior to 2018? But is actually a sideshow created by a noted conman in the early 20th century? What the fuck.
im 35 min in and this is so cute omg
I give eddy the award for being the #1 Youtuber to watch on road-trips
40 hours in 8 days lol. Thats a cake walk. On the reg doing over 100 hours a week in a moving vehicle
you're never welcome in Texas specifically San Antonio ever again after this. I excused Ur review on the rainforest cafe, but now MY Margaritaville? i wont take this hate.
Okay - I've seen YouTube whore out this video for a week now so I'm gonna click on it ONLY TO ASK A QUESTION     Why the fuck would you eat at _every Margaritaville in the Country_ ? What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. You?
Eddy finished this journey a depressed alcoholic with a fear of Margaritavilles
So what's it going to be next year? Hard Rock Cafe, like someone else suggested before I got here?
patiently waiting for next years bubba Gump journey
Been to two of the Margaritaville restaurants, the one in Orlando and one in Panama City Beach. My favorite menu item is....Cheeseburger in Paradise!
"Winter" is such a banger
I have only seen 3 videos by this guy. The Morbius video, The Rainforest cafe video and This one. I don't know how he does it tbh.
those prices are insane
Is that nakeyjakey
Honestly, shout-out to the employee who risked Jimmy's wrath to warn you about the jambalaya
The title of this video is false. You did not eat at the Margaritaville on St. Thomas, USVI, a US territory. Still a part of the country. We need justice!
This is the best free advertising that margaritaville could ask for, and they didn't even have to ask nicely for it.
22, that's nothing. Do all 34 bubba gumps accross the country next 😂
Nice video
Sooooo.... Every Bahama Breeze restaurant next year then?
Since you have been progressing in terms of number of locations...you should try going to every Hard Rock Cafe, there are 33 total locations.
this makes me feel like i have friends 😊
next year it’s every hard rock cafe
This is incredible content.
but why...........
Bubba Gumps should be next, And you can end up in Las Vegas again across from Rainforest Cafe!
TBF, I have had some pretty deep self-reflection while on the toilet
I went to my local Margaritaville and ordered a burger.  It was literally one of the most flavorful burgers I've ever had.
1:32 what is this classical song? Been trying to find it forever
Next year: Hard Rock Cafe
You have sold the idea of an American road trip for me.
If I remember correctly from when I visited PCB a year or two ago, they were building another Jimmy Buffet suburb there
Next summer Hard Rock Cafe
I cannot believe you went to the one in Tulsa, I spent the whole video assuming you skipped it. I actually accepted an award there at a conference last year and they gave all of us college students $25 to gamble. I did one high-limit machine and lost it immediately, haven't gambled since.
I double dog dare you to go to every skyline chili
as a minnesotan, it is always so concerning to hear that the MOA is the biggest mall in america. idk why but it's just so incredibly disconcerting.
This is the best sequel I've seen in years.
45:55 Five Nights at Margaritaville
Canada best margaritaville for the win baby! Let’s go!
thank you for your service
My husband ran into you in New Orleans while he was on a boys trip! Thanks for stopping to take a picture with him!
i’m so glad u stopped at bucees this time
Can’t believe the mad lad did it again
i see you subtly hinting at Planet Hollywood mister burback
At this point, these road trip videos feel like catching up with old friends. Also, we might need one of these every summer!!
Ya’ll should eat at every Top Golf next. I found the food very similar, theres a similar number of locations, and you’d HAVE to play golf every time you went to one lots of material
Now you two should go eat at every Ghost Kitchen in the Country (and Canada)
You guys should do the hard rocke cafe location next ide love to see u guys go to the one in hawaii
Next stop is all hard rock cafes
These two have infinite money
WASTING AWAY AGAIN IN MARGARITAVILLE
Give me 1 margaritas and I’ll drive across the United States to visit all the margaritavilles
Do the Hard Rock Cafe
THATS MY BUCCEES!!!
The power of jimmy
YOOOO THEY WENT TO MARGARITAVILLE IN SAN ANTONIO WITH SCHITT LETS GOOOO
So you just forgot about the margaritaville in bossier city Louisiana ?!?!
My opinion of Jimmy Buffet just went from an ambivalent dislike to an enthusiastic hate. It's the worst kind of corporatization of pop music.
All gave some, SOME gave all... Thank you for your service Eddy
I live in Syracuse and as soon as Eddie mentioned it I was like.. oh no he’s going to hate it lmaooo
At least you didn't visit the one in Evansville, Indiana. It closed like 10 years ago and was a terrible depressing spot. It was right on a highway, between a cracker barrel and a hotel.
Why did you choose a TEXAS location to try the fish n chips? And not, I don't know, somewhere known for their fresh fish? I don't understand your choices.
The Atlanta traffic is a b word. W for the Margaritaville Atlanta crew for getting you sorted.
Why do I feel that all YouTube videos have to be 8 minutes long or an hour+ long? I feel like there's no inbetween. People either want their hours long video essays or TikToks
So what's next year bubba Gump?
Key West Margaritaville is GOATed! I went with my family a few years ago.
Gimmie one margaritaville … and I’ll give you some gas … great video new here !
Living on sponge cake, watching the sun bake
the Madman returns for yet another culinary adventure of extravaganza
I look forward to the next horrible chain restaurant road trip
Another video that proves that North America is still stuck in the 90s.
I went to the margaritaville in Hollywood beach FL. I went with my family, had two rum runner margaritas and some ribs twas good. I also found a hunk of coral on the beach and named it Carl
me, in the other end of the world: hah, interesting
17:22 you did WHAT TO THE CHILD
Boofay.
9:46
imma just say that i enjoyed living vicariously through this road trip while being grateful i didn't have to suffer through all those super sweet margaritas lol
bloody brilliant
I’m Australian and don’t know who Jimmy Buffet is but this is an enjoyable video
this is the first Eddy Burback video I have ever watched.
As a non-American these massive malls are a marvel too me. Like....wtf
Nuh uh
You need to do Bubba Gumps now
you didn’t go to the one in osage beach missouri. u are liars
eddy pronouncing biloxi as bill-locks-ee instead of bill-lucks-ee hurt me deep
Bro do Hard Rock Cafe 😂
Bubba Gump Shrimp tour when?
Don't beat yourself up because you can't be like Jimmy, he could only handle the lifestyle with that "lost shaker of salt" on his side and that would've made the journey twice as expensive
Next year u gotta do Bubba Gumps
What about Hawaii?
ok now go to every cheeseburger and paradise restaurant
See you next year for the 34 Hard Rock Cafes 😂
i wanna see every olive garden in north america
seeing a lot of medieval times, hard rocks, and bubba shrimps in the comments as suggestions. i’ve been to all of them and none of them have been that special. honestly if i were you i’d discontinue it here before it gets out of hand…
Perhaps next year another major trip of chains, maybe Hard Rock Cafe😂???  Just kidding, don't want you to torture yourself going to the 30 locations in the usa+Canada. I appreciate and support the hustle you made on this and the rainforest cafe journeys.
See you next year for the Bubba Gumps Challenge
May I suggest... Hard Rock Cafe?
Ya know, personally, I've never been to a Hard Rock Cafe... 👀
Ded, absolutely ded  that y'all thought you could make it through Atlanta "quickly" 🤣🤣🤣  Spoken truly like someone who has never had to go anywhere in ATL at any time of day.
Do Hard Rock Cafe.
stache ur giving me so much of it...
I haven't ever been to one
You should’ve met up with Kurtis Conner in Canada!!
Do Medieval Times next or HardRock Cafe!
We had an offshoot of Margaritaville near my house called Cheeseburger in Paradise (Owned by the same company), the food was decent, but as a kid, I loved the atmosphere. (I live in the heartland, tropics is not a common theme in this area)
My stummie hurt
I learned from margaritaville I'm never drunk enough, or at a beach.
Wish you could have seen the Niagara Falls Margaritaville at 1 AM on a Saturday
I lost it at the kids aim during stinky feet.
as a clevelander it was so nice to see our lord and savior tim misney make it into the video
THE MISNEY EYEBROWS. I KNEW IT WAS CLEVELAND BEFORE YOU SAID IT CAUSE OF THAT
Bubba Gump Shrimp next
Jimmy Buffet also makes entire retirement communities
Bubba bump next
I always forget that half the YouTubers and others I watch are all friends  Also thank you for visiting bucees, if I'm lost and need gas I like watching visitors lose their mind over bucees- also the Brayden remeetup is insane, I'm sure that made his year xD
Hard Rock Cafe 2024
i just watched a 58 minute video and it was the first one i’ve seen from this channel.. absolutely loved it and subscribed 🥰
I see Ted made the classic MOA out-of-towner mistake. When my friend visited from chicago, they wanted to go on the mutant masher less than 10 minutes after eating at Johnny Rockets. I'm lactose intolerant and had eaten chili cheese fries and half a mocha milkshake.  I threw up all over the ride and a bit on their shoes then bought my go-to work outfit
Do it again 😤
im not done with the video but im SO glad you got to experience the CA to Texas road-trip ICON known as THE THING
Wahlburgers next
What about the Conroe Margaritaville?
48:24 Weezer
next year you guys should go to every texas roadhouse in the country
Do every McDonald's next.
YO MY MARGARITA VILLE WAS the WORST LETS GOOOO
Rip to the Margaritaville in the French Quarter of NOLA. They had a walk-up to-go margarita window and they’d give you two per person. I hung out there alone once on a family vacation while the rest of my family was at church and the waitstaff treated me right. 🫡
ted wearing the thing shirt
Do Olive Garden next #gobigorgohome
DO MEDIEVAL TIMES NEXT!!!!
now do red robin lol
Dope o didn’t know there was a Margarita Vill well I rarely go too Time Square but I do live in Manhattan cool place
Now you should do medieval times. 😂
I actually just got back from Tennessee, being from Wisconsin, and I spent the whole time in pigeon forge/Gatlinburg thinking it felt like the dells.
Unfortunately, it is with great sadness to tell you that you did not hit all the Margaritavilles in the US; you are one location short.  The Palm Springs Margaritaville is the only one that you did not go to. But you have chance to eat there if you go across the country to eat at every Tommy Bahama restaurant.
Now go to every Had Rock Cafe, and get the Local Burger at every one
I tried the Orlando Margaritaville and both my S/O and myself had a horrible time and both agreed we'd never be back, let alone give every location a shot xD
I'm happy you we're able to view such a nice sunset in in my hometown. I love Panama City!
“The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea??” lmao
You sir, are an official " parrot head" welcome to the club. 😅
Eddy’s got that gay (girlfriend’s) boyfriend fit DOWN PAT!
I lived in syracuse for a long time. It was really nice to know im not the only one who didnt like that margaritaville
Jimmy buffett is a mindset
Phx to elpaso them are short miles
The video of the doctor seuss ride gives me flashbacks. Some young children would get scared at Thing 1 and Thing 2, not even joking. Hilarious hearing their screams right before you went into that same room yourself, only to see the nightmare induced creatures from Dr. Seuss's terrible mind.
Jimmy Buffett, it's like the wiggles, but for boomers.
Have you wasted away yet?
have you considered contributing to society
I'm sorry to hear that
Now you gotta visit all Buc-ees
I had no idea the Margaritaville at the Mohegan Sun casino in CT closed. *shrug*
Ayeeeeee happy to see you come through El Paso. Chuco represent
bet you wont do mcdonalds next
You guys forgot the Margaritaville in Bossier City Louisiana
Twice in a row now, Eddy's broken down in a restaurant in the Mall of America. Damn, I'm sorry Minnesota is doing you so dirty, we'll try harder next time 😭
that was fantastic lmao
Oh, um..... Why???....
Well i'm from florida and yeah those bursts of rain are fucking terrifying when you're on the road
You should go to every Rax Restaurant in the country!!!
This is your brand now 😂
😂😂 the rainforest cafe trip wasn’t that horrible. It was a great video atleast. But god bless your soul for doing this
Now you guys have to eat at every Dick's Last Resort in the United States
So you gonna travel to all the Hard Rock Cafes next year?
The O in Biloxi is pronounced like a U so like Biluxi 👍🏼
visit every burger king
Y'know, I don't think this was the intended dining experience that Mr. Buffett had in mind
I looked up all the Margaritaville resorts, and there is something around 30. Absolutely mind blowing.
Do you still hang out with the othe kids from the breakfast club?
The moral of this video and the rainforest one is that every gimmick American chain restaurant is better in Canada
Didn't realize anybody went there to eat.
You should do hooters next
As a New Yorker I felt such a surreal horror in my soul imagining being a tourist wandering around Times Square drunk and alone in the middle of the night
I went to college near Branson Missouri which is considered the "sister city" of Pigeon Forge. The Main street (We call "The Strip") is exactly the same and has many of the same attractions. We did call it the Family Vegas of the Midwest and it is so funny to hear Eddy call Pigeon Forge the same thing. lol
WHY WAS THE END ACTUALLY EMOTIONAL LOL
i have been on that elevator before shit is crusty
I quite honestly thought Cinnamantoastken started doing different content I was so confused
why did you need a pickup truck for this?
imagine if you did all hard rock cafe locations in mainland us and canada c:
I am questioning your menu selection.
Discovering America was a mistake
Awesome Vid nice work!!!You should consider visiting every Bubba Gump in the U.S next!
Huh
HE FOUND THE THING
Go to bubba Gumps next
17:00 Eddy not showing the little kid on camera is just such classic good guy Eddy stuff. Lots of people wouldn't even have the thought to not film someone who they could otherwise feature in their video for a laugh.
Dude u also missed the margaritaville in the Ft. Lauderdale airport
I saw you guys when you went to Epcot in Orlando!! It feels very cool to know that moment was technically a part of this video !
As soon as I saw you guys were doing this again I was HYPE 🌟 and then I remembered wait Syracuse has a margaritaville....OMG they're going to be a destiny, USA 🥹 now every time I walk by Margaritaville (which is always that empty and bland) in the mall I can say two of my favorite YouTubers were there 🤣💖
Did I miss it? What about the one in Lake of the Ozarks?
what I don't get is how you didn't characterize this as masochism
Should have come to margaritaville Bahamas
If you guys ever do Bubba Gump Shrimp, drop me a line.
I served Jimmy once at a cafe in Charleston, SC. He was wearing a Jimmy Buffett shirt as was everyone at the table and they were terrible tippers.
CHEESECAKE FACTORY NEXT !!!!
Being Canadian, I've never tried Margaritaville at Niagara Falls - it's always seemed like a tourist trap with abysmal reviews. But NOW, I will need to go JUST to get Buffalo Chicken Poutine LOL. We used to have a Rainforest Cafe, but I think it closed down. We now only have a Cheesecake Factory - YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. YOU MUST VISIT EVERY CHEESECAKE FACTORY !!!
Silliest achievement ever.
Next up: Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?
Good
out of all the vehicle options you guys choose a fucking Tacoma
I’d like to think that each hair in his mustache represents each mile he has traveled.
I hate to break it to you but you didn’t go to the margaritaville in Shreveport Louisiana
20 years from now: “We ate at every McDonald’s in the country”
my favorite pastime in universal stuidos is going on the cat and the hat ride and screaming at the top of my lungs to scare the kids
Now do Bubba Gumps...
Eddy burback more like
Can't wait for next year's Bubba Gump trip.
Imagine if you did every McDonald’s in American
Next year, Hard Rock?
Marc Maron has fallen on some hard times
Guy's first name is Thomas and he decides to go by Binkley... I hope that's just a marketing decision for his little side show.
Leave it to Orlando to be a disappointing stop, always trying to stay on your mind.. with the nightmares.
Omg, the way you said Biloxi...LMAO
The way you said Biloxi actually made me cringe lol
Sooo you might have missed one Eddy. I think in the time you shot and filmed this, they actually recently opened a Margaritaville resort in South Padre Island, Tx. Might need to finish this one off soon!
i ate at the ohio one, was pretty dope
No jacksonville beach margaritaville what is ithis
Djeet yet? Dja shake ja bootay? Dja lick dapussay? Signed: Imap Ussay and Ima Noncey
This video was somehow not long enough!
Same guy, same shirt we Stan
holyshit is that the boy nakey jakey?
I got an ad for the transformers movie as you were showing Ted’s truck from last time and it looked like his Tacoma became Optimus Prime
9:35 that's not the face of an innocent man Ted, do you have something you want to tell us?
Well done!
Pretty sure Biloxi is pronounced Bilo 11
Come for Jimmy Buffet. Stay for the undiscovered true history of aliens vs dinosaurs.
What about the one in Hawaii?
How sad
Honestly wanna go to a margaritaville now lol
Looking forward to next year where you eat at every Bubba Gumps in the world!
thank you for showing what the thing was. I drive that highway atleast twice every year from CA to TX and I have always wondered what the thing was but i didn't want to take the detour and pay.
I have no idea how you stomached any of that…I’ve seen roadkill more appetising
This is the greatest movie i've ever seen
fascinating story is comming soon
OK GENTS, LETS DO IT😎

what a ripoff
😅
oops
i say they go back
they didnt do every single location
Very good video
You should visit every Chuck E. Cheese
Somebody @ me when the state timestamps come out, please :)
Hasan Piker really let himself go.
GOD i need to know the song that played during that one sunset
u didn’t go to the margaritaville in palm springs… so this video is A LIE
We stayed at the Margaritaville in Orlando the last time we went and it was nice I guess there was a awesome British pub in the shopping area near the hotel and it was delicious sat inside had a couple guinnesses and some shepherd's pie it was just a fun time any of you go to that one in Orlando check out that British pub near it
So ig that just leaves every Hard Rock Cafe in the world…
I've only ever eaten at the most accessible Margaritaville in the nation: Miami International Airport.  Despite Avianca's best attempts at making me blame their food for unfortunate events (instead of Avianca being the shittiest mainstream airline in the America's), I can/will definitely call myself a Margaritaville fan. 😎😎👍🏻👍🏻 Hey, I just noticed that you didn't go to that location...
Isn’t there a Margaritaville in Gatlinburg, TN?   Fun video though I liked that
Not only you guys made my favorite YouTube video ever. You made two of them ❤
Y tho
very glad you were able to witness a florida man out in the wild
I live in NH!!!          I was almost near Eddy!!!!
Gotta do hard rock cafe next
The death span at rainforest café sign... Gets me every time. Thanks for the adventure, for Sharing and telling such a good story.
I am Canadian, French from Québec, maybe why, but I have NEVER, I promise, heard, seen ANYTHING about this Margaritaville before! The heck
Forgot the one in Jacksonville. Gotta do the entire thing over
Funny that the Canadian restaurants in both trips are the highlight
THE THING
Did you stop at the cheese rat?
HEY you didn't go to the one in CAPITOLA CALIFORNIA SO THIS VIDEO IS A BIG LIE !!!!!
Jimmy Buffett? Nah man, I'm more a Jimmy Neutron kinda guy
You’re scared of gas station Walmart? Relax
You guys should do next Hard Rock Cafe, or visit all M&M’s store in the country
Jimmy Buffet is the greatest thing since Adulf Hltler. Glad you could be in his presence, Eddy! :)
Caitlyn Rae is shook
Ok, now you must meet up with Brayden on every single country wide chain restaurant tour you go on. He's part of this now too.
After watching this I have so many questions. Like, how many people went to these Margaritaville Hotels and then found 357 reasons to not live anymore while staying there?
thankyou for your service yet again 🫡🫡🫡
If ISIS only went after Margaritaville's or any DJ's that unironically play "Cheeseburger in Paradise" then they would be less evil.
Ted: Stockholm Syndrome
Wait did I miss Jacksonville Fl, or did they forget that one?! (I wanted to see them declare it the most pathetic in the country!)
26:05 😂
Atlanta Margarittaville fucks
A month long vacation of touring America and getting drunk at Margaritaville's. It's truly insane what the rich spend their money on.
am i the only one who REALLY wants a video about all the planning that goes into these trips? i want to know the PROCESS.
Hi Eddy and friends, can I introduce you to "The Great Food Truck Race"? I believe a season to season comparison and general appreciation for the show is in order.  Thanks,
Eddy is putting himself through a culinary dystopia for our entertainment. You're the real MVP.
There are 33 Hard Rock Cafe locations in the US and Canada boys. Pack up and finish this trilogy out RIGHT.
Oh my God I live in Biloxi, your pronunciation killed me 😂😂
Hit the Bermuda triangle that is Atlanta traffic I see. The bane of my existence on road trips.
You skipped the Conroe, Tx. location on the lake
Ive always wanted to try going to one
But eddy what about margaritaville at sea??
I got food poisoning just from watching this.
Now they just need to watch the margaritaville musical
I hope they do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next.
Im just gonna be that person who only comes to eddies channel for the i ate it all videos.🎉
These videos are great because they reduce restaurants and chains to what they truly are despite the location.
Wow! Who knew you could make a corporate empire of mediocre crap off of one mediocre crappy song?!?!?!
Now do every Apple Bees!
Ever thought about doing this with Bubba Gump shrimp Co? It the Forrest Gump themed restaurant
Why do americans lije trucks so much? Rent a station wagon
Vegas strips for Midwest family tours had my dying
Where’s The Lake Conroe location?
who the god damn hell is jimmy buffet
Now do Joe’s Crab Shack 😂😂
Why are there so many locations next to rainforest cafes 😂😂
do every mcdonald's next xD
I was just at Buccees in KY and the place was an absolute madhouse
@ 46:32   Eddy spots Cleveland's overlord: Tim Misny.
49:30 ted has stockholm syndrome
I liked and watched your video before, but youtube removed my like.
that cat in the hat ride is very “i have spoken to god and he has abandoned us”
I would be amazing if you found a chain that was amazing even after the 20th meal in a row.
wow! this was really repetitive, boring, and unfunny
Go to all Dick's Last Resort
wait.. is that jakey?
There are 54 hooters in the state of Texas alone
Wild watching y'all drive through Charleston and Georgetown on the way to Myrtle. Also, wild that you were  here!!
$17.50 for a chicken sandwich. Absolutely unreal
I got a stomach ache watching this.
Next stop Guy Fieri restaurants?
I’m grew up near Destin and it’s so crazy to hear people talk about it lol
Hard rock cafe 2024?
YMH needs to cover this lmaooo
ive never been to a margaritaville, might have to try sometime
6:26 "You guys don't know how hard it is to be a YouTuber." One of the most objectively hilarious statements ever stated. 🤣
OMG living in Texas, I cannot tell you how much i despise Bucees  And everyone here loves them!  It’s always so crowded, they only have like Bucees brand snacks, and the bathrooms are not worth it  Plus that beaver is so creepy   The one saving grace is that because Bucees doesn’t allow big freight trucks, there is almost always a truck stop gas station across the highway  With cleaner bathrooms and few people
36:28
All i have to day ask about this whole video is...how is SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND???
excited for next years video "i went to every weird themed amusement park in america"
now it's time to go to all the hard rock cafes in the world.
I NEED to go see The Thing.
Who cares?
You called time square a fever dream at about the same time I said this entire video feels like one big fever dream. lol. NGL, this makes me want margaritaville. We used to drink at the bar in Hollywood when I lived there. Food was garbo though.
I used to caption those tiki boats in naples florida lol
"driven over 40 hours in 8 days" bruh you need to take me along as driver, these are rookie numbers
Missed the one in Shreveport Louisiana
I’ve never been to Margaritaville before, but it looks pretty damn fun! Time Square is overrated, but Canada looks awesome!
Thank you for your service.
You guys should do a toad trip hitting every bubba gumps shrimp co in the us!
Planet Hollywood's gotta be next!
I have driven from Tucson to Abilene Texas three times and I have never stopped to see The Thing though I, too, have been bombarded by the signs. Thank you so much for doing it for me!
I missed you guys in pigeon forge by a day. i am sad
I ate at one of them. In Vegas. I'll never go again. To that location, or any others.
If you guys ever decide to do Whalburgers I’ll gladly dine at the Hingham MA (original) location with ya. You can end in Vegas again 😂
Next Up: Medieval Times. 9 US - 1 Canada locations.
Go to long horns
You’re from commiefornia. People see the commiefornia license plate and instantly know there’s NOTHING value able in your suv with an open bed because like commie trans people, they identify as something they’re not.  We also see a commiefornia plate and know anything you might’ve had was already stolen 10 times over. The only thing that’s in that truck bed are pee buckets and feces buckets. Maybe a used needle bucket. I’ve seen what’s in commiefornia, homeless, mentally retarded people that have libtardia (brutal brain disease that turns human brains into soup because libtardia is real), gang members, murderers, drug addicts, enablers, communists, rioters, hoodlums (can’t use the proper term for those people but y’all know what word I mean) and people with single digit IQ points.   No one’s stealing from a commiefornia suv that tried to have truck nuts attached because it identifies as a truck. It’s a fucking explorer that shaved only the back part of its head.
Thats the mustache of a man that has been a fan of Jimmy Buffet this whole time but just didnt know it.
my grandparents live in a gated Margaritaville community
Din Tai Fung
Eddy missed the bigger margaritaville in nashville..???
One song made this empire. Only in fucking America. Crazy shit.
Hawaii probably feels left out lmao
Next year Bubba Gump!
So you're doing every Hard Rock Cafe next right?
4:57...Eeeew why are the onion rings so dark, should always be lighter and crisp(must-have been used oil over and over again, not cleaned)  6:15 the next day "tummy hurts"...eeeeeek
The perfect sequel.
are you ok?
Oh cool you saw THE THING. I went to The Thing museum a few years ago and I went with someone I didn't know very well so we both didn't know whether we had to believe in aliens for each other or not. We went back in forth between being like ahh cool and like wait wtf.
God i remember seeing the destin Margaritaville 😂 i never went but i remember seeing it and the PCB one. Pier park was nice.
The THING!!! I saw it in 2004, when I moved to California 😊
So messed up they didn’t go on the cruise!
Planet Hollywood or Bubba Gump lol
5:27 jarvis :(
You should go to every airport Chili's
I think he missed the Nashville one tbh
Wow this was bad.
If you have a death wish, you should tour the Hard Rock Cafe.
There’s also a Margaritaville cruise, which has a restaurant on it. I think ya’ll have one more to go to.
What a great duology of two men's journeys of self discovery and themed food. Of course, you could always go for the trifecta of Rainforest Cafe-Margaritaville-Bubba Gump.
You need to stop with the slowly dying small chain restaurants im gonna see a video on your channel soon called committing arson at a margaritaville.
36:55 Ted: “I’m fucking losing it man 🤠”
Can't wait to see which restaurant chain you go to next year.
Incredible, but next year give the people what they want.... Bubba Gump Shrimp Company! 22 Locations in US.
Next up is bubba Gump shrimp co
Hard rock Cafe next 😂
He didn’t go to the one in the Puerto Rico airport
Asking JJWD, if Jimmy Jones would have to do that, he probably would take off his sandals, lay back and say "fuck this, I'm staying on the beach"
What about the jax beach location
But! Did you go to Big Al's Beeritaville in Louisville, Kentucky? Only the best knockoff Margaritaville for this town.
did you stop at the sewee outpost? in charleston ?
You didn't buy an airplane ticket out of Detroit to eat at the Margaritaville inside Detroit metro airport? Disliked and unsubscribed.
this is def not EVERY margarita Ville cause there's one on Lake Conroe
Shoutout to Atlanta Margaritaville for that experience!  Random guy on the internet comment section appreciates you, each and every one of you who work there.
He did it again
Margaritaville is great. As a Jimmy buffet superfan, that place is great for me and awful for my friends. A specific memory of mine is zoning out in the big chair inside the Atlanta margaritaville dresses as sagiri from eromanga sensei after a long day of momocon shenanigans
i'm blocking this channel so i don't have to see your tired face any more.
I feel like the only logical thing to do next is Hard Rock Cafe
As a Texan, please help me there are puddles EVERYWHERE
It's a shame you skipped, Bossier City, LA at the Margaritaville Resort and Casino.
Oh man! The Thing exhibit has changed ALOT since I was a kid.
I just love how Eddy looks like he's constantly wearing a groucho marx
❤
Try this with every McDonald’s in the US
Hey Eddy, if you have the time, what was the music used?
There’s like 4 other Margaritavilles in California, what kind of scam you running? I demand you do the whole thing over again.
Eat at every single McDonald's 😂
You're missing out, all the best ones are in the Caribbean. The Margaritaville restaurants in the Caribbean some of them have a water slide to a pool.
Can't wait until 2035 when Eddy visits every Olive Garden
"I woke up with a stomachache and it was almost certainly the Margaritaville food" Proceeds to explain he ate almost nothing all day and then had alcohol and high fat food for dinner. That will make anyone feel sick
the Thing exhibit reminded me of the Mystery Shack in Gravity Falls
39:45 this reminds me of when I rode the great wheel in Seattle back in 2015, I unironically was in full Ness cosplay. Nobody noticed... '_'
You are…. gonna be constipated for like a month after this.
fun video but remember when you publicly abandoned your best friend in order to not have any backlash because of drama surrounding his PERSONAL relationship
What about Margaritaville on lake Conroe, Texas?
Is Eddy the guy from Her?
Gotta love how at almost every turn, you were haunted by the shadow of the Rain Forest Cafe.
Margaritaville Veteran.
I watched the rainforest cafe video and i have never seen any of your other content and i was very excited to see the latest video you posted was this
Lol I think I walked by you doing this at PC sorry but thank you for doing this
You are so wrong for playing Vivaldi. Like Margaritaville can be compared to any of the restaurants of chef table.
Where too next boys?
Aw man. Wut da hell jimmy buffet doin on the epstein flight list man??😢
Huge miss not showing the tabs of your visits
It seems the best Margaritaville Food and the best Rainforest Cafe food you’ve eaten were both at Niagara Falls Canada. Awesome!!
I visited the Cleveland Margaritaville 5 years ago. It still, to this day, stands out to me as one of the most horrific bar experiences I have ever had. Everything was sticky. The floors were sticky. The doors where sticky. The bar was sticky. The people were sticky. Boomers dancing everything to 40 year old Jimmy Buffet hits. Truly felt like an adult Chucky Cheese, felt like I was going to contract something just standing there.
Wait your deep Eddie? I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty
God i love margaritaville
Imagine if they go to the Hard Rock Cafes, that'd be hilarious thing.
You were 100% pulling off that hat my dude.
I can't wait for the Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co glorious adventures to come
tbh, I've never heard of jimmy buffet or margaritaville before this video.
The carbon emissions bro
The final question: Are you an alcoholic now?
I wonder what chain restaurant we will get to see break your soul next year
Next year yall should try to go to every single Buc-ee's
NakeyJakey, is that you?
I noticed I wrote a comment on Ted’s video so I must return to Eddy’s to let him know I watched Eddy’s first. It’s your, Eddy’s, video that inspired me to jump into Ted’s right away when I saw his video trending…
man. america is weird as shit
52:30 was one of best parts lmfao
Just wanna shout out the editing in general! But especially the lights flicking on with “Have a little faith”
Question: what about the original Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio?
DLC update: Airport Margaritavilles
Damn that went from kinda fun but lite on details when it comes to the cringy parrothead world to absolutely unwatchable real quick lol   I tapped out at the merch ad
I have 2 words for you: McDonalds
DIDNT EVEN HIT THE SC ONE
Next trip: Hard Rock Cafes.
so where is next?
Next year is the Flavortown restaurants, there’s only like 6 of them and the one I’ve been to (the one in Pigeon Forge, right behind the Island where the Margaritaville is) was actually really good.
No you didn’t,  I’m building a remodel of a margarita vill in South Lake Tahoe right now.  It’s the saddest job I’ve ever been on.  Dudes do not know what they’re doing.
Haha absolutely love Ted suddenly in the 'The Thing?' T-shirt
I hope yall do a third one. My favorite content from you guys
Margaritaville is garbage
Eddy, I have to say thank you for introducing me to the song Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett. I now listen to it multiple times a day.  (I can’t get the chorus out of my head. Someone help me.)
So eddy "I ate at every hardrock Cafe in America and Canada" next year?
the fact that you said that the one in syracuse was below average and lifeless just shows me that upstate new york people are just lazy as fuck. i need out of this state lmfao
Hard Rock 2024 !!
Do Bubba Gump next. Up the ante.
14:28 IT'S FUCKING BIL-LUCKS-SEE
Missed Boston my dude
lmao I have the same green loveseat
You didn’t go to the Margaritaville in St Thomas USVI
I hope next time will be either Hard Rock or Bubba Gumps
Do Medieval Times next please it’s so chaotic! I can’t think of many other themed chain “restaurants” though…
It's like if Sisyphus was a volunteer
I like that Ted kept getting merch
I didn't think the Syracuse one was even open anymore.
Time to do all the Hard Rock Cafes
They gotta do medieval times next
You might hate yourself, but you probably don’t hate yourself as much as this guy.
dollywood is incredible, my family had season passes every summer growing up (I'm from Knoxville) and its the best theme park imo
Yeah guys a new Margaritaville is opening in August in Boston.
Now...do Bubba Shrimp
Is Jimmy a relative of Warren Buffet?
Now eat at every single McDonald's in the country
love watching eddy slowly get Stockholm syndrome for Jimmy Buffet and seemingly get under some sort of mind control cult-ish thing for like half the video
now go to every olive garden
Jumpscared by Tulsa (I am from Tulsa)
Naturally I feel like Cracker Barrel has to be next
There is a  margaritaville in Oahu Hawaii too 🎉   May the adventures continue!!!!  lol
why Money my sanity means NOTHING
Jesus youre handsome
You went to every Margaritaville in the country? I wouldn't brag about it.
Margitaville country is the most beautiful and interesting place
I used to live in pigeon forge! Weird seeing you go through there.  When I was a kid, either my class or my boys and girls club group got invited to the island before it officially opened, and we got to ride the wheel! I thought it was so cool back then. It's lost its luster to me now.  Dollywood is fine, btw. Multiple family members used to work there. I only like going there during their Halloween event because I'm not much of a ride person. Can't stand roller coasters. I just like looking at the pumpkins.
see y’all next year for bubba gump shrimp co
Buccees js my worst nightmare. I made it 10 feet into one before it freaked me out so bad I had to leave
Every Medieval Times next?
Here me out: Hard Rock Cafe next
If you really loved Jimmy you would have eaten at cheeseburger in paradise on your trip too
My dads name is Jimmy. He’s a parrot head. First song I remember hearing was Come Monday that he played on the guitar and sang. But seriously I can’t listen to JB. My dad played him out for me. But it still gives me a sentimental vibe. Also, watch out for the pre parties for JB concerts. You’ll drink way too much!
Why?
Eddy’s solo picture at the ferris wheel actually made me scream
I don't think the casino in Tulsa is owned by Margaritaville.  I worked there and it's a Creek casino.  Probably just heavily branded.
I don't see their google or yelp review for the Atlanta location...
My friend used to bartend at the Lahaina location.  He would throw liqour bottles out the window onto the beach so we could drink for free. Highly recommend.
You should do every McDonalds
next year: Hard Rock Cafe
EDDY! Hear me out. Next year. Bubba Gump Shrimp chain. 23 locations. You got this.
Lol the Atlanta one is hilarious. Good ole traffic. Great people down here too
Hard Rock Cafe next
thinking ab how eddy said the syracuse location was the worst, as a syracuse native im not surprised nor do i judge him for it
Well, I'm from Florida and the rain can F*** OFF
New subscriber. Lol this was great.
A Tacoma seems like a very odd choice for this road trip haha
Your feet pixelated is somehow worse than I think your ordinary feet would have looked.
You mean to tell me I’ve spent the last two months working at universal and I missed Eddies visit to marg town?
I will now endeavor to eat at every Micky D's in the country. And Canada. You will rue the day, sir, when you pretended to the throne.
What about Jacksonville beach Florida Margaritaville🥸 I was so hyped after you went to Orlando I was like ayyyyy jacksonville is next 🥳
bro cut out all the ole smoky shots in the pigeon forge Margaritaville, not upset just woulda been cool if you came in to see me.
vivaldi's 4 seasons is an absolute bop, I'm hooked from the beginning
Where do I pay for the feet? Asking for a friend.
2024: "I Ate At Every Ruby Tuesday's In The Country"
Next, do every Buffalo Wild Wings
Biloxi is pronounced - "Bill-uh-xi" - your local Mississippian
Without a doubt you’ve gotta visit every Buc’ees
Yes
This makes me so hungry! Makes me excited for the “I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in America” video coming soon!
Visiting every McDonald’s up next lmfao can you imagine? Let’s make it happen
Do it at bubba gumps next!!!
Next year: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
you should go to all the bubba gump restaurants
I expect a "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe" next year lol
Do all the Dave and Busters next 😂
As an Australian who only knew Margaritaville as that place in the musical "Escape from Margaritaville"  (which I have never seen) this was absolutely fascinating. I had no idea Margaritaville was a real restaurant! Let alone a chain. This video was an incredible insight into American chain restaurant culture. Amazing work.
Oh come on how did you not make an aggro crag comparison at the Biloxi restaurant! That looks just like the mountain on guts!!!
this reminds me of when i ate at an ihop connected to a hotel every meal for about 3 days. it’s about 9 meals so i can’t even imagine the pain of 20+ meals at the same restaurant, but even that amount from the same restaurant drove me nuts
Well the alien portion of this video didn’t age well over the last week now did it? 😂 seriously check out the UAP hearing… they picked this week for disclosure.
You guys missed one in lake of the Ozarks Missouri
Watching this video made me crave tartar sauce, so I found a recipe and made some, then I needed something to eat it with, so I found a recipe and made some fried shrimp, then I ate them and it was very delicious. THANK YOU EDDY FOR THE VIDEO
This is my favorite series on YouTube
They just wanted that jimmys jumpin jambalaya for themselves.
How many Dave and busters are there in America…. What about fuddrruckers…..? I just want a repeat next year!!
now eat at every Rock Cafe in the United States 🗿🗿
Ive lived in Nashville my whole life and THIS is how I learn we have a Margaritaville!?!
Holy shit 4.5 million views in 10 days
60 days, 200 locations. Do Cheesecake Factory
Where do you think they are going next year
Hard Rock 2024
Next road trip Bubba Gumps “mama said life’s like box of chocolates”
Why was the food so expensive always?!? Also mostly not good looking and not bug portions. I dont live in usa but thought u guys have cheaper restaurants
28:87 you seriously are pulling that hat off so well
Dude, I lived in Myrtle Beach for about 15 years and never went to Magaritaville, and because of your review, I still won't be.
Watched the whole video for the Syracuse one and it was the shortest time by far lol
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
If Bubba Gump 2024 doesn't happen I swear I may have to up my Zoloft
Shreveport LA not on your map.
Did you skip the Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio?
That Dolphin saw his feet for free. Way to go Dolphin.
I lived in Key West for six months.  I am extremely proud to announce that I survived that experience and most of society would be gobsmacked at the many experiences that I survived that I would not consider to comment on.
why tho
You guys now need to go to the Margaritaville Cruise lol
CANADA!🍁🇨🇦🇨🇦🍁CANADA! I’m so proud that we where the best!
Can’t wait to see you guys go to every Bubba Gumps in the US and Canada
Hmm…. I wonder if their gonna do Hard Rock Cafe next year😏
Shreveport???
dead
Soooo, who's gonna tell him that he missed the Margaritaville in Pensacola Beach, Florida 😂
2024 should be McDonald’s
I started watching this the day it came out, but had to stop 10 minutes through to go on a trip to New York with my friend. Two days later, we ate at the Times Square Margaritaville. Now, I'm finally back to finish it. The one time eating there was chaotic enough for me for at least a month, godspeed to you for doing it twenty-odd times.
Munching Manatees
Hear me out visit every muffler man and or Paul Bunyan… in the US because there’s a lot
Saw this video in my recommended after having a great experience at a margaritaville, turns out it was completely separate from jimmy buffet and just shared the name for some reason. The food was 10/10 and the location was even better so you could say I was shocked when I saw the truth
Was that rock climbing wall the Super Agro Crag!?
Hey @EddyBurback how’s about every Hard Rock Cafe in the world next?
Is there an SCP for the Cat in the hat?
Capitola?
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame... But I don't. It's his own damn fault.
Did you forget about the one in Louisiana?
Do a roadtrip visiting all MacDonald's in America.
Living in Myrtle Beach, the hurricane was triggering childhood memories I thought I repressed
not the tim misny jump scare 😭
My grandma is near Biloxi and I never saw the margaritaville hotel, I’m pretty sure it’s very new
watching this just to see if he went to the one in city walk
Eddy didn’t récord New Orleans because he had gay sex with Ted
Syracuse margaritaville hasn’t paid their rent to the mall in 2+ years. Surprised they are still open.
I wouldn't want to eat at one Margaritaville.  To each his own.
i learnt so much about the usa in this video lmao
I literally went because of the “gimme one margarita ima open my legs” song I had no idea another margarita song even existed 😂😂
I think Eddy has an obnoxious foot fetish.
DIDNT GET TO THE US  VIRGIN ISLANDS OR PUERTO RICO!!!!! LOOKS LIKE YOU GOTTA DO IT ALL AGAIN
i was not expecting to watch a full hour of this, but it was riveting, top notch content.
Please tell me there is a trip planned to hit every Bubba Gump Shrimp location? lmao
Did y’all skip the one in Jacksonville beach, fl???
I absolutely love this video and the last one. The hour actually flew by!! I hope he does another one next year!
Maybe you guys should do Bubba Gump Shrimp next year?....
So is next year Bubba Gump shrimp?
the statistics of that fella braden being there are actually astronomical holy fuck
I wish they would do a downtown flavor town video. loved the two travel videos.
the rainforest haunting was exceptional
I love jimmy buffet
Bro why tf do you keep doing this to yourself 😭
While you were in New Mexico should’ve stopped at an allsups. Best damn gas station burritos ever
If Mayor Daily was still running Chicago, the “Bean” would be cleaned spotless every, single, day, and not look like the south side.
I live in Atlantic City NJ. Worked at a marina. Jimmy flew here in his sea plane and I had to go pick him and he’s crew up in a boat in the inlet where the plane landed. Few hours later I took them back to the plane. Was pretty cool.
I went to the one in Cabo.  It was disgusting!
Bubba Gump shrimp next year?
Now do Waffle House.
glad you got to tour our dying megamall here in Syracuse.  The Margaritaville is always dead and I'm surprised it's still in business. condolences
Wait, isnt there also a margaritaville cruise?
Awfully whiney for something you chose to do. Really not worth the watch.
There was one in Phoenix/Glendale...did it close?... yes December 2014
Micky Mouse says you're a sissy.
Having been to so many margaritavilles and several margaritaville hotels with my elderly family trying to manifest their key west dreams, I love this video.
This is stupid and I LOVE it.
THEY MISSED THE TWO MISSOURI MARGARITAVILES
i couldve met you because i was in pigeon forge at the same time you were there
Can you visit every Pizza Ranch in the country next please?
spencers
I was kinda nervous waiting for the Margaritaville in Tulsa, since I have worked at that casino. Yay! I am glad you had a good experience at that location. I hope you saw the volcano eruption.
Guy Fieri has a shit ton of restaurants, I smell a trilogy
They’re making a margaritaville in BOSTON when the Pacific Northwest is in a complete margaritaville desert ?? THE INJUSTICE !!!!!!
"My tummy hurts again and I don't care anymore" is literally the story of my life.
Ha I need to go there my last name is binkley 🤣
I think it would be a funny idea to check in with a dietician before and after the next road trip
Now all you need to do is go to all of the hard rock cafes next year to keep the tradition going
I’ve literally only been to 1 margaritaville in my life. I went in vegas and I thought it was a joke 😂 i didn’t know people actually went there
Shreveport, LA?
now do McDonalds
I’m so confused with the Chicago Margaritaville. The bear on the ceiling is the exact same logo of Kutztown University in PA. What is going on
Y'all were looking right at Planet Hollywood at the end of the trip...and there's only six of them...
52:53 is unironically eddy’s bladerunner 2049
This video, at many points, was a descent into madness. At others, a case study in the effects of Stockholm Syndrome. At all times, an absolute masterpiece.
Looking forward to next year's Eddie-Torturing road trip
Could do a mini road trip to the  Paula Deen's restaurants. You haven't hd greasy until you eat her butter boiled foods.
This video made me want to throw up
I don't know why I loved this so much, that's all.
"morning margarita"? dude that's just what i call "Australian breakfast".
47:55 didnt they all just drink 🤔
forgot shreveport bozo
How do any of these other places you visited (like Bucees) stay in business? None of them would be able to afford to hire anyone in Norway
Thanks for the first multiple, out loud laughs of the day
I'm sure you've eaten more Margaritaville than Jimmy Buffet ever has
hot girls have stomach issues
Next year every medieval times
Everybody knows you can’t stop at 2 when beautiful 3 is right there. Just rip off the band aid and admit you’re going again.
I'm sad you didn't visit the other location in Miami!! Yes there are 2 location in miami.
As a former restaurant employee it really surprises me and warms my heart that the Jimmy Crew worked extra to let you guys experience their margaritaville for the video! Thats honestly one ofthe best reviews they could have gotten and I hope they see this video. As well as hoping that Jimmy Buffet Incorporated sends you a check
“second and final” okay so bubba gump next year?
You mentioned Wisconsin Dells. That was my childhood. Still love that place!
Now it's time for every Bubba Gums shrimp
A couple of friends and I, one who lives in Niagara Falls, went to the Rainforest Cafe there with the inspiration of your previous video, about this time last year. We ended up at Margaritaville, I felt delirious and all I had was a Landshark Lager (it was like 11pm and we had been up since 6 am), but it was a truly memorable experience, that would not have happened without you and Ted. So thank you. The next day I came down with covid
can’t wait for every hard rock cafe!
12:09 Loving the shirt
Hard Rock Cafe has to be next year
EDDY BLURRING HIS TOES GOODBYE
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. here comes Eddy.
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe
Bubba Gump next year!
i had no idea there were so many ¨shitty woks¨!
they missed a  Margaritaville in Texas. It is located in Conroe and it is a resort
you know, jimmy is the elusive type and might reach out..... he is chaotic
You didn’t go to the Margaritaville in Lake of the Ozarks Missouri. Do the whole trip over again
3 words: Bubba Gump Shrimp!!! There are 22 locations in the USA
Next year you should go to everything in the US!
You never in fact ate at the Rainforest Cafe in Auburn Hills, MI. Calling cap on this video as well
Next up Medieval Times.
I hope next year he goes to every dicks last resort
So sad you didn’t make it to the one up in jax 😭😭
Watching this in the Myrtle Beach Margaritaville right now. Glad I didn’t get the chicken sandwich lol.
19:00 I think someone had selected the screen on that tv... you know how you can "select" the youtube video on your computer? I think that happened. Just drag from below to over the Youtube video.
just got back from florida for vacation. the worst dinner we had was at margaritaville
Do the Hard Rock Cafe next
RIP to the presidential candidate Ryan Binkley
Even tho you spent less than a minute of runtime on Cleveland, I’m glad you at least snuck in some Tim Misny billboard action. The real ones know what’s up
Waitress: Hey there! have you guys dined with us before!? Ted: 😐
Need an update with the margaritaville cruise 😂
why did i watch the whole video
I don't know how I stumbled across this video, but I am glad I did. Dude had me cracking up. I enjoyed the video so much, I got on my phone to make this comment. Haha The Margaritaville we had in Kalamazoo, Michigan only lasted a few years. I believe the building is a Goodwill now.
The PCB blue TV is a staple, glad you enjoyed our beaches, you picked the best time to go 🍹🌊
I'm glad you enjoyed the San Antonio Riverwalk - it's one of my favorite places in town, and it really is unique in its own sense. Next time you're here, make sure to do a boat tour of the Riverwalk! You'll learn a lot about the history of my city and the Riverwalk itself :)  The Alamo is also a fun touristy historical site right near the Riverwalk, so if you're into historical sites I recommend visiting it as well.
Fantastic use of Vivaldi
Thank god you ran it back with Ted again. Genius.
Hard rock Cafe incoming
Eddie its "Buh-Luxe-E" Not "Buh-Lox-E"
you get 2 views from me. enjoy ;)
Why did Margaritaville have to come to Canada??? We are an innocent and well meaning peoples!
no idea who jimmy buffet is, so i googled, and as youre mocking him, hes sitting on a billion dollars in the bank. lol. what???
Im convinced that by the time you made it to the mall of America teds happiness was just his sanity finally broken
47:11 - Gotta love the Man shouting that 😂
Do every McDonalds. No balls.
Man you guys should jave tried the stone crab claws in key west. It will literally change your life.  I love the cultist narrative this story took too. From finding faith in Jimmy to disillusion, apathy and eventual insanity. Truely a heroes journey.
You guys didn't go to the one in Capitola, CA 😢
I just realized, Ted and Eddy, that's, like, the same name, right? Edward?
I cannot stand the way he says Biloxi.
Can't wait for every Hard Rock Cafe next year!
Nice video
This reminds me of my favorite Jimmy Buffett joke. What's the difference between Jimmy Buffett and Taylor Swift........Jimmy takes accountability for bad relationships while Swift blames everyone else.
They have one in the airport gate area at Cancun. That is the only one I have ever been to, the breakfast was good.
Ted: I have ears like a dog, so it might be a dog whistle thing-  Eddie: I think it might be tinnitus
Your desk is a little small. Might need a bigger one.
we're slowly training for "I ate at every mcdonalds in the country"
was that nakeyjakey
I don’t understand how you can ignore the Margaritaville, cruise line. They depart from United States. You need to return and do a special.
I think a big reason you hit a wall when you did was the back-to-back double days, at that point would have been around 1/4 or more of your meals by that point, in less than 48 hours, with the rest kf the meals being either hotel breakfast or road snacks-- i think ANYONE would be feeling pretty rough, & im guessing you werent going to the gym on the road & hungover, so you go sit down in a car to go sit down at a restaurant then go to sleep -- THAT will do it, too 😂😂😂
Fuming you didn’t do this when the margaritaville musical was on broadway a few years ago.
you have a brand deal and still do mid roll ads every 5 minutes?? not watching
How did I end up here
man had an entire character arc over a restaurant
Ayo South Carolina represent. But in all seriousness the SC location sucks compared to any of the Florida ones.
people have conceived babies in the Margaritaville hotels, I dont like that thought
Can't wait for the Hard Rock Cafe
"we needed to get in and out of atlanta by car FAST." are famous last words lmao
Who's that small guy Schat?
Do McDonald's next
So many of the locations look identical to Bubba Gump Shrimp locations.
Naked Jakey ❤❤
Traffic to Atlanta completely stopped?  NO WAY!!  That has never happened!
What about Palms Springs?
stuck on the highway heading to atlanta is just the driving to atlanta vibe.
I cant believe next year they are going to every Bucees Next Year :o
Amazing dude😂
does every mcdonalds... dies
“The day you have self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea “ had meeeee dying   😂😂😂
ive been to the one in mississippi a few times its pretty good
how many red robins in america?
That black Opal shirt is sick!
I guess now you guys travel to theme parks not named Disney ?
Seems like the amount of margaritavilles really got to you. Maybe next time(for a break) you should go to medieval times( there’s only 10)
Every Bubba Gump next?
You should go to all the planet Hollywood locations easy challenge
I hate that I watched this whole thing.  I've never once thought about Jimmy Buffett in my life.  Thanks for making this useless piece of American culture mildly entertaining. The longest and weirdest advertisment I've ever seen.  I hate that it will make this chain more popular, but I respect you for it.
Can't wait for next year when you eat at every taco bell in the United States
Next year: I ate at Every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country
P L A N E T H O L L Y W O O D
You Miss the one in Capitola CA.
I can't believe you came to Tulsa. Having so little to do in the city, I've been down those halls so many times.
👇do it for the oklahomies
Perfect that the worst one was in syracuse
Congrats and all on your sissy trip but A REAL man would do something that's actually a challenge and visit every McDonald's in the US and Canada!😂
52:55  You look lonely.. I can fix that..
Jimmy didn't turn one hit song into a chain of restaurants. He actually turned two, there used to be a chain of burger places called Cheeseburger in Paradise. That chain closed in 2020, but there are a couple unrelated places with that name in Hawaii that outlived the Buffett branded ones (Buffett tried to sue but they were allowed to keep the name as long as they didnt expand) that you can go to. They have a pretty nice view, and the food ain't bad.
Bro that “the thing” “what if” place is literally just the plot of the movie 65
Bubba Gump next or? Planet Hollywood or????
I especially liked the part where he ate at margaritaville
Is this going to be a yearly thing?
😂When i noticed "The Thing" shirt when he sat in the big chair in SA
Bubba gump shrimp next year
…..anyone ever heard of the Hard Rock Cafe?
Elevator sounds like a Wolfenstein 3D door.
You sure about that part where you said it was your LAST trip? What about Bubba Gump's Shrimp? You know there are 34 locations, right? Maybe you should check those out? *Wink wink nudge nudge* Please Pin this so people can see how accurately I predicted the future?
Jimmy Buffet looks like if King Charles and Joe Biden's love child moved to Florida.
Man I don't remember Ed Kemper being a YouTuber
seems like dumb content
After watching Ted's video, looks like I'll be wasting away again in Margaritaville with this one.
In a world often fraught with stress and routine, there exists an oasis of bliss where time stands still and worries melt away. Margaritaville, the famed restaurant inspired by the legendary Jimmy Buffett, has transcended mere culinary delights to become a life-altering pilgrimage for many. This paradisiacal haven has the power to touch the soul, bringing forth a transformation akin to the Second Coming of Christ.  Stepping foot into Margaritaville is akin to entering a mystical realm, one where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and everyday life fades into insignificance. The ambiance alone is intoxicating, with vibrant hues that transport patrons to the sunny shores of a Caribbean paradise. The whimsical decor and laid-back atmosphere evoke a sense of carefree euphoria, all thanks to the visionary mind of Jimmy Buffett.  Speaking of Buffett, it is hard to overlook the profound impact this troubadour has had on humanity. His music, filled with themes of escapism, island life, and the pursuit of happiness, has touched the lives of millions. He is, without a doubt, a prophet of joy and serenity. His ability to craft melodies that resonate with the soul is unparalleled, and his lyrics serve as guiding principles for a life of tranquility and harmony.  At Margaritaville, the spirit of Jimmy Buffett is palpable, as if he is present in each margarita served, each verse played by the band, and each delectable dish that graces the tables. It is as if the man himself has blessed this establishment with his divine wisdom, transforming it into a temple of self-discovery and rejuvenation.  One cannot underestimate the profound effect this place has on those who enter its hallowed doors. Countless patrons have emerged from Margaritaville with a newfound lease on life, a spark of inspiration that propels them toward their dreams and passions. For some, it is the catalyst that pushes them to embrace a more carefree and adventurous lifestyle, casting aside the shackles of monotony in favor of a life well-lived.  The staff at Margaritaville, too, play an integral role in this spiritual awakening. Their warm smiles and genuine hospitality create an atmosphere of acceptance and camaraderie, as if everyone is part of one big island family. It is this unity, this connection among strangers, that solidifies the belief in Jimmy Buffett as the pinnacle of humanity—an artist who has transcended his music to foster a worldwide community bound by the pursuit of happiness.  In conclusion, Margaritaville is more than a restaurant; it is a transformative pilgrimage, a sacred retreat, and an ode to the prophetic genius of Jimmy Buffett. It awakens the dormant dreams within us and reminds us that life is too short not to live it with passion and authenticity. So, if you seek a spiritual revival and desire to experience the Second Coming of Christ-like rejuvenation, venture into Margaritaville and embrace the gospel of Jimmy Buffett. Your life will never be the same again.
the 52 min insanity break was fire
thank you for honoring new mexico's treasures. i love The Thing?
Huge
Im glad Tulsa treated you well
now do every hard rock cafe
i can’t believe this video was an hour long
Yall didn't go to the Margaritaville Resort in Palm Springs....
love these road trip videos with you and ted, they make my whole summer ngl. you guys should've ended the trip by going on the margarita ville cruiseship lol!! :'D
Eddy next trip Cheese Cake Factory 😝
my grandfather is a huge jimmy fan and goes to his shows all the time, but once, he passed out from drinking so much so when my grandmother finally got there, people were stopping  and taking pictures with my grandfather blackout drunk in a lawn chair
Man I loved the first one but this is legitimately peak entertainment.
I look forward to next year when this becomes a trilogy. Would all 34 Hard Rock Cafe restaurants in the United States be too much to ask?
I love how when you search "margaritaville" on youtube, these two videos are now listed before the original Buffett song. Glorious.
Love this so much!
"The day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" Best line in a travel log
Volcano nachos were fucking 3300 calories. 🤣
As bad as this is, it still has to be better than seeing Morbius five days straight.
If y’all do this a third time with like Bubba Gump or Hard Rock cafe, I hope it turns into a Forrest Gump thing and you get a bunch of groupies joining in at various points in another insane journey across the country 😂
This and the rain forest Cafe one both fill me with so much joy. Thank you for your service.
Margaritaville has a cruise company with two ships. just letting u know.
I wanna see Eddys bank account of him eating and staying at every margaritaville all around the country (and Canada), it must be so weird to just keep scrolling and seeing margaritaville for awhile
I’m a life long-long resident of Biloxi, MS. Jimmy Buffett is actually from the Mississippi coast, more specifically Pascagoula
Every Hard Rock Cafe, do it, you wont.
I don't know which is sadder, making this video or that 4.3 million people watched it
From this video I learned that Myrtle Beach has a large model of the Morris Island Lighthouse (the real one is near Charleston), but painted in its modern faded look instead of how it looked in its heyday. Which is an interesting choice.
So....Bubba Gump's next, right??
It’s videos like this that prove normal tv is dead. Highly entertaining hour.
Margaritaville speed run. Nice.
Turnstile should play Margaritaville.
Was trying to watch a video about the atomic bomb only to have this video be recommended lol nice
Is this desk real? 😂😂😂
There’s a margarita ville in a southwest airport in Houston you did not go to (past security).
all the Aquari-yums next please
myrtle beach’s beautiful
You didn't go to the Margaritaville in Honolulu.
I had a friend/ housemate who worked as a server at the Pigeon Forge location years back in like 2017/ 2018 and they had an incident where some pipes burst in the sewer line or something and the kitchen sinks, drains, etc filled with sewage that overflowed onto the floor and they still kept the restaurant open so I've refused to ever eat there lol
"Last time we made the mistake of driving a two-decade Tacoma around the country. This time, we learned from our mistake by renting...a Tacoma."  I've been a Tacoma owner for over a decade, but when I travel I rent a full-size car because of this little thing called gas mileage. A Hyundai Sonata or a Chevy Cruise is going to get at least 10 mpg better than a Tacoma.  Also, cars have trunks.
Yea and? I used to hang out with Jim years ago in Florida yes we have some stories
7:06 *swinging car door* "I have- I have ears like a dog so maybe- it might be- like a dog whistle-" "I thunk it might be Tinnitus 😀." PLEASE
Do Olive Garden you coward
Last time I was on the cat in the hat ride it broke down when thing one and thing two came out and they were just convulsing, it was terrifying.
If there’s anything these videos are teaching me, it’s that everything is better in Canada
The Rain Forest Cafe reference knocked me out😂😂😂😂
i died inside a little hearing Eddy say biloxi wrong
27:01 that cloud looks like a fat AT-AT
Ted, loved the tropical cocktail shirt you wore towards the end. I would love one for my husband. Mind sharing where you purchased it from?
THE THING is a southern arizona staple
Thank you for your sacrifice.
Should have let us know when you were in Bloomington. Gf and I would have packed you and Ted a little care package.
I feel like we would be best friends
Why did you keep getting the chicken, Eddy?
i only watched this so you would have to do another road trip. hahahhaha
Y’all missed the margaritaville in Conroe Texas.
Do Mc Donald's next
Krissy is fine ❤
Its time for the next saga…. I ate at every Bubba Gump in the country
You skipped Sandusky, Ohio
anyone notice this guy kinda looks like Ed Kemper
53:37  Eddy: "Lucky for me, the menu and food quality at this one was much better than most Margaritavilles" Me, living 15 minutes away from that Margaritaville: *_*N O T E D_**
I used to work at the Honolulu location.  I will say this. Regardless of what the food is like, it had *the cleanest* kitchen in the city.
So glad you got to experience the most holy of locations, the length of highway connecting Chicago to Minneapolis
Hard Rock cafe next?!?; 😅
I was just at the margaritaville in Key West!
Eddy you’re finally getting the recognition you always deserved for putting yourself through restaurant hell
40:50 best reaction
Leave it to a Californian to be afraid of rain.
i remember being hungover as FUCK watching the rainforest cafe video last year… nothing has changed 🥰
5:28 Nakey Jakey! My boy
had a guinea pig named Binkley. you should have listened to him.
I feel like Jimmy had Eddy hostage and wouldn't let him go until he posted this video.
But why though?
omg you found tim misny
we don't get to see the dawgs for free!?
deep eddy is actually a good vodka
But what about the Margaritaville at Lake Lanier in Georgia?
SoFi sucks! They sued to stop the pause on student loan payments. Love your content but please research your sponsors
Chicago is the best one.
Next year go to all 210 cheesecake factories :)
i’ve never wanted a margarita so bad in my entire life
I have been the one in key west and and Destin
Eddy no! This is the unexpected sequel of the decade!
why is the jambalaya green :(
Apparently these were so successful Jimmy opened a second chain based around cheeseburger in paradise, which I went to in Vegas as a kid. I thought the exact same thing that it was like a fucking cult based around cheeseburgers.  You gotta be crazy successful to build an entire chain around your SECOND biggest song.
Jimmy Buffet has a net worth of 1 billion dollars and now i know why
𝖇𝖗𝖔 𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖜𝖕 𝖎𝖒 𝖉𝖊𝖆𝖉
The Thing museum in Arizona is truly a wonder of the world.
I'm going to go to the Atl one now since they're nice.
this was a good video
Tnightus? TINNITUS
NW Florida is among the best parts of the country.
I've worked in people's houses that have Jimmy Buffet merch everywhere and stuffed parrots on the walls. They're called parrot heads.
7:16 Jack.
You didn’t go to every margaritaville in the US
Wtf was bro aiming at💀
I'm gonna be honest, during the Thin segment I completely forgot that this was about a themed restaurant road trip and when they went to the next Margaritaville I felt like I was snapped out of a trance.
That Buckys gas station is the most American thing ive ever seen
Will Eddy dare to eat in at every McDonald’s in the Country lol
34:44 Yikes, they closed the kitchen early? I doubt that Jimmy would be pleased to hear that. You may have gotten a bunch of people in trouble.
I watched this instead of Oppenheimer
Did that train girl in PCB say “Hello, Hi” wayyyy to much?
next were gonna see "I ate at every Red Lobster in the Country"
48:12 bean (personal replay button)
Now do every McDonald’s in the US
What about the Palm Springs location
That Times Square location is visually amazing. Also visited the location in Chicago and was not impressed by the service or food.
When the theremin comes out to denote existensial horror you know shit is lit.
52:52 Blade runner moment
Honestly our government telling us aliens do exist means the "The Thing?" is totally plausible.
Up next. Texas Roadhouse
My gf loves jimmy
Weird flex….I’ll watch.
Next:  Eat at every McDonald's in the U.S. and Canada.
the indoctrination to Jimmy by day 9 is great
42:46 "This [Statue of Liberty holding a margarita glass] was a shining beacon of light for all of those across the world who wanted to head to America and eat at a Margaritaville in Times Square."  I died laughing.  Then I came back to life to post this comment.  Thank you. 😂
the syracuse margaritaville may have been sad and desolate but when it’s month 7 of wintertime and all you want is some sunshine and tropical ambience it is really a lifesaver
He got wasted away again at Margaritaville...and again ...and again...and again...
this must be what Sisyphus feels
Lmao dude its pronounced "Bill-uck-see"
who is this man
Lol these videos are so funny  Can you do Cracker Barrel or something next!
HardRock Cafe next?
Love these types of adventure videos! Ted is so effin hot!! My gawd!!
Seems like you could have saved a lot of time had you filmed this and the rainforest video at the same time
The funniest part is when he says it's the final time.... He doesn't realize they still have to tour all the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co locations
You know what's next ... Medieval Times 😳
For next year you guys should do every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada. 36 locations and even more fun!
Can I go to every buc-ees’s with y’all?😂
Not kidding when I say this, but as person who loves road trips and pointless accomplishments, this is the video that made me subscribe. I would DEFINITELY love to see Every Restaurant + Road Trip become a series.
Eddy you and Ted are amazing! 2 years in a row, but you guys missed one! The one in my hometown of bossier city, Louisiana. Yes that one is really nice and they have a buffet there that serves wine slushies!
Can't wait for the Mexico sequel.
This is really important. Thank you.
The shot where the kids ran by is so cute
Do bubba gump next!
My favorite is Orlando lol
"vegas strip for midwest family tourists" jesus christ that is an accurate description of the wisconsin dells
Show me yer toes 😡
Now do Cracker Barrel
complete the trilogy
So are you going to do the Margaritaville at Sea cruise next?
I am a owner of Margaritaville
American Chain Restaurants are so garbage. It’s crazy how they exists. I heard someone say Olive Garden is their favorite Italian restaurant.
The dude yelling in Chicago is my fav character
I definitely didn't think margaritaville was a region in florida
You guys remember when Eddie was just a goofy looking dude not some hunk with a great Stach
What about the one in Palm Springs
Hard Rock Cafe?
haha funny video eddy     Hard Rock Cafe next.
Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in America…
Wow I love watching people ruin their health and sanity for content!
Tourist lose their mind to buc-eecs, not Texans, their average.
yoooo tom selleck
My feet smell like corn chip
I’ve been to the ones in myrtle beach, pigeon forge and key west. Key west was by far  my favorite. And I actually like the cheeseburger in paradise. I ate it 3 times in kw.
I still can’t get over how many times he order that basic looking burger 😂😂
The jimmy buffet sector is definitive, once you cross the boundary there can be no mistaking what kind of country you're in
Their next trip across the country is buckees for sure 😂 or dolly world
EAT JIMMY
Rainforest Cafe trip: Ted has a fun slice-of-life adventure while Eddy descends down all 9 circles of hell Margaritaville trip: Ted and Eddy each go through a full TV season's worth of character development and come out as better, more enlightened people  Just incredible.
The voice says trust, but the mustache says danger.
Do Joe’s Crabshack next year lol
Ted's getting payed for sure for sure
the next logical step is Bubba gump shrimp co. see ya next year.
next year do it on Hard Mode, and do all the Hard Rock Cafes
Ted has the voice of a Hollywood movie serial killer.
this took me three sittings to finish
The Conroe one isn't on here.  Unsubscribe.
But Why?
It turned into a towcoma
One who got a lot of views I imagine.
But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Jimmy Buffett.
"We seem to be in the most Texas corner of the entire restaurant. It had the two things Texas is famous for" As the camera pans to the steer I immediately thought he was going to say "Steers and Queers" and then I remembered it's 2023 and someone would undoubtedly be upset by that joke and threaten to lock themselves in their parents basement.
Buc-ee’s is the best!!!! I’m wearing their shirt while watching this. Also the closest one to me is like 7 hours away. Greatest place on earth lol.  You  should go to every one or most!
I had the Jambalaya one...like 15 years ago or something
Now do it w Olive Garden
This chain is creepy.
39:43 i spit out my drink
Next, every McDonald's in the country
Those sweet suitcase tricks were hands down the highlight of this video
This must have been the most american video I have seen. From the idea, to the restaurants themselfs, to the other stuff they did and saw on this trip. As a european this feels like the definit america experience.
When you going to all the Hard Rock Cafe's?
Do subway next
Do every TGI Fridays in America next!
Eddy, every IKEA in both the USA and Canada. I dare you.
There were a ton of one liners in this production, but the best by far was "The day you had self -reflection is the day you had diarrhea!?!"
Fake news, false advertisement
Man is a FRAUD!! Completely ignores the Margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach, Florida!!! You passed it driving from Orlando to South Carolina!!!!! Sad.
Now there is one open in south padre island, tx :b
Umm, how can you talk about Jimmy Buffet for an hour and not play any of the music? It's called fair use, son! Introduce the song and move on.  And are you doing every Bubba Gump next?
Do we even need to argue abou how you couldve picked the worst car ever for this trip?
23:15 Welcome to my home 😂😂I'm on Duval street every weekend and have only been to Margaritaville like 1 time
Aids burger in paradise!
Let’s goooooo 😂😅
aaaaaaa im so glad you got to visit the pcb location!! i grew up there so seeing it get attention is warming my soul  😌 i miss those sunsets
9:37 that face looks like a yes idk man
watching this 12 beers deep and damn… I need a margarita now at Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville
I FORGOT WE HAD A MARGARITAVILLE. THIS MF SAID BILL OXY WTF
So I don't know if anyone has already said this but there is  a Margaritaville in Pensacola Florida that I think you guys missed either way awesome video great work.
Hear me out, there’s only 20,603 subway locations in the US. If you start now… you’ll never have to make content ever again because you won’t have time.
Soooo… Bubba Gump next?
Get a job.
Missed rhe one in santa cruz
This is one of the most creative stories I’ve ever seen on YouTube and perfectly executed. You’re a legend man!!
Here at 4,299,526 views.
8:19 aha I stopped there too recently on my trip from California to Texas!!
i did not know Margaritaville is a restaurant
"The Day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" Hahaha!
If you do another one of these trips, I feel like renting a Tacoma has to become part of the tradition.
38:19 Oh boy, that might be a seemless transition to Jimmy's part of Alan Jackson's song It's Five O'Clock Somewhere
There's something insidious about these out-of-step / black sheep guys
As a New Yorker I wasn’t aware that Margaritaville is not a common restaurant
might be the worst of all time
I got a horrible stomach ache just watching this.
thanks for the video, deep eddy.
Anyone else spend and hour of their life watching a guy spend 24 days of his life traveling to 22 margaritavilles? 😅
Ive been to the Chicago margaritaville
I just gotta say. Winter The Four seasons. Is perhaps the funniest bit of editing I think that's ever been done to the likeness of Jimmy BUFFETT
Hard Rock Cafe next year???
I thought Jimmy buffet was some sort of politician.
Ay Eddy Ninepins is back
the bucees dude??? thats actually so cool
You should eat at every Arby’s.
It's not your final one and you know it
I chose this over the watching South Park…. I do not regret it
Next time you could go to every Medieval Times location. I think there’s 10ish so it would be “fast”
I like how in both of these trips (Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe), Canada has been the highlight of both trips.
Buba Gump next year?
I’m sorry but I laughed so hard when the towers popped up 😂
Ironic how Shlatt appears shortly after the 9/11 reference
This title is a lie. There is a Margaritaville Resort in the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri. Otherwise I loved the video.
There’s definitely a margaritaville in Honolulu
There are 34 Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurants. Use this information wisely.
eddy, i didn’t know u before this video and i have to say you are an excellent film maker and you’ve earned a new subscriber
I don't know who this Ted guy is
uhhh dude you didn't go to the lake lanier one in Georgia. wtf man CLICKBAIT!!!
I think the only thing left to do is finish up the shitty restaurant tour with every Hard Rock Cafe in the US, Canada, and in Mexico.
Loved the picture alone.
Buddy said 🥸🥸🥸
Good job. I am surprised you didn't mention the drive between NYC to Syracuse.
why tho
Torrential downpour, touristy restaurants, and the cat in the hat ride. the true central Floridian experience
So acording to the rules of YT the next one has to bigger so eating at every Chuck E Cheese in the US?
Never in my life have I heard of deep eddy vodka but an hour after watching this I got an ad for deep eddys on Facebook lol
The whispers of Hard Rock Cafe next year are getting louder…
Damn, at 15:00 they play Mattie Maguire's Racing hearts! Their music needs a shout out!
Now eat at every Cracker Barrel
I absolutely DARE YOU to go to every Cracker Barrel. I know that’s a dead man’s mission, but I will have the utmost respect for you if you do it.
Do bubba gump shrimp company next pls
YOU GUYS DIDNT GO TO MARGARITAVILLE AT SOUTH PADRE, TX!!!
this is the exact same as the rain forest cafe video even has the scary ride and all that
Came here from FFXIV o/
LOVE SEEING NAKEYJAKEY
Cat in the hat looking like Pinhead.
bubba gump shrimp co? 🫣
Cant believe i just watched an hour long video on margaritaville
Hard Rock Cafe next
Good
Looks around Mall of America, next one must be Bubba Gumps?
I only ate at one in Negril
How many lbs did he gain ? haha
I'm pretty sure Drew an your girlfriend are fucken eachother while your running around doing your videos I can tell from that clip where they are standing next to  eachother
If there is a problem with the food, like it's dry, then tell the waiter and they'll give you something else.
Imagine if he visited all 600 + Cracker Barrels in the United States.....
i can't believe the rainforest cafe video was already a year ago, i hope this "i ate at every themed restaraunt in the country [and canada]" becomes an annual tradition
This dude could pass as AquaFPSs older brother lol
can you please eat at every american girl doll store bistro in the country
Patreon version has the Uncensored Toe Cut. Best $20 I ever spent.
I was fully expecting food poisoning from so much Margaritaville
now do bubba gump shrimp
I've worked at the Margaritaville in Pigeon Forge since we opened in 2014 and loved that you showed part of the store here, since, well, I'm the supervisor in there. I hope you were treated well...unless I was having a bad day, then you were probably just bothering me.😂🤣😂
Honestly... Please do this again for something else I love these videos do something like every six flags around the US or another terrible small chain. Well worth the wait!
You’ve still got to do Denny’s
You both already know that all the Hard Rock Cafes are next , look deep into your souls, you know it to be true.
Did you not go to the one in Atlantic City!? Or did I just miss that part lmao. Or more likely it wasn't worth showing.. I ate there 2 years ago and it made my stomach hurt. But I got to keep my marg glass!
You deserve what you get at these TGIF/ chilis type of restaraunts.  They all suck.
Fake boy.
We used to have one here in Bloomington Indiana, it was in the parking lot of a Petco. Across the street from a Christian science church and a chiropractor.
now do hard rock cafe  coward
You guys need to do more of these! They're a hit!
yea the rain in florida is nutso.
God bless the algorithm.
cmon guys where are the time stamps
Now out do Morgan spur lock and eat at every McDonald’s in America
As a Tulsan I enjoyed your take on the River Spirit location, made me laugh ❤😂
Incomplete challenge you didn't get the margaritaville in the lake of the Ozarks you lose
I’m in destin realizing that I am here a week after he posted this and I realized I COULD’VE MET EDDY BURBACK!
I noticed you skipped Shreveport/bossier , Louisiana margaritaville 😂
Warren buffet would never eat at his own resturant
the dog won the whole trip for me
that’s awesome, I haven’t left the same surrounding 10 sq miles in 4 years
So when's Hard Rock Café?
As someone who went to a fair number of these as a child, I had a flashback when seeing the inside of the key west location. Somehow my child mind recognized the immediately.
blink if you need rescuing man
Okay next time do every subway in America
Was Ted like hooking up with hoes?
What about Jacksonville
I finally ordered something from a youtuber shop. I did NOT hesitate on that shirt.
Eddy. Hard Rock Cafe. Theres 34 in the united states.
Bursted out laughing when you zoomed in on the alien ass
Now do every McDonald's, you coward!
Hes a a very boring musician and this video follows suit.
So like...Hard Rock Cafe Next?
That's the kind of road trip that will turn your car into a Fartaritaville
why?
Eddie legit goes through the 5 stages of grief on this trip
You write well. Thanks. Margaritaville? Not on a dare. My Mom worked for a giant food co. for decades, She a PhD in Nutrition, where she ran a test kitchen. I am a Chef, was perhaps, but I left the game to pursue vast wealth in other fields of endeavour. I got the 'artist' thing out of my blood, finally.  I did a lot of consulting work for Her, them, on the road with her and we ate, commonly, in restaurant chains we had as clients. Chain theme food is abysmal and generic generally assembled by felons and drug addicts.
LIES!!! They didn't go to the one at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.
Great video, Eddy!   Now do “I ate at every McDonalds in the country”.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
I’m from syracuse and you can definitely get lost in destiny usa if you’ve never been
All you need to do now is go to all of the Bubba Gumps’s Shrimp Co.
They have to do Hard Rock Cafe next
bro you gotta go to casa bonita
“Every Margaritaville in the country AND CANADA”???? Dear god… why would you do this to yourself…
Yesss, I loved this video! And the song (winter by Vivaldi) is one of my favourites
Our lord and savior Buccee
So what about US VIRGIN Islands St. Thomas margaritaville?
Did he miss Bossier City?
A sequel more anticipated than Avengers: Endgame, Mission Impossible 7, and the Dark Knight Rises combined.
i think your videos are why the algo is serving me clips from The Trip
Next video: i ate at every Cracker Barrel in the Country!!
👍
Didn't watch video. Just saw thumbnail on my suggestions and wanted to say this guy looks like a walrus. God bless ✌️
I feel like I've watched this before.
Now do McDonalds
Me and my family just stopped at The Thing gas station about a month and a half ago and we were harassed by employees about how good the museum but we passed. INSTANT REGRET 😩😭
Happy to be from Syracuse, the home of the worst Margaritaville you have ever seen.
52:58 honestly cracked me up lmao
The food looks horrible just awful. Why would anyone drop money here?
Cant wait for the day this guy eats at every mcdonald's in the world
13:03 Nice.
i only clicked on this video because every time i saw the thumbnail out the corner of my eye i thought it was the Super Mario World world map
He did this twice. Eddy you did this twice.
Jimmy Buffet is technically a frat bro of mine lol -- we could all only dream to match his shine 😂😂😂😂 lmao
When is the going to every Hard Rock Cafe video happening???
I am so glad you remebered the Tulsa Margaritaville. Veryyyyyyyy important to our city.
42:53 "you look lonely. I can fix that."
53:56 Rip-off Polar Krush,  Knock-off Scrooge Mcduck,  Fake Jessica Rabbit  perfect margaritaville casino characters
Impressive,but not as impressive as eating at every Mcdonalds in the world
I don't often leave comments, but I have to say this video feels so comforting for me. Watching two roommates do something epicly dumb as eating at every Margaritaville in the country reminds me of my younger days doing similar things with friends. And now that I'm older and unable to travel instantly or do wacky things as before, it's wonderful seeing content like this to remind me of a simpler time.   Something tells me the next travel video will be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the Country 👀
I wonder if Mr. Buffet has ever eaten at one of the restaurants;)
If they are renting a car for a 9000 mile road trip entirely devoid of any off roading or cargo hauling, why in god's name did they rent a pickup truck? Did they want to maximize their gas costs and expose their luggage to the elements just for the lolz?
What I love is 75% of the video is just tangent adventures and anecdotes about THE most random things.  You just got one more subscriber!
i want to know how much it costed to eat at all of these lmfao
Stockholm syndrome in video format
Nothing like a shitty chain restaurant for those who don't really care about the food or drink because they will enter said establishment already intoxicated.
You've got this and your mustache. What a personality.
Looking forward to next year when you go to all the Bubba Gumps in the US and Canada. Followed by hitting all the Medieval Times, and then the finale where you go to every Hard Rock Cafe.
whats with the censored toes
I wonder why they didn’t go to the Capitola, CA location?
I've been to that exact Buccee's and yes it is massive lol. The fudge is SO good though.
Can't wait to see the Hard Rock Cafe trip next year! :))
Wait, so you're telling me you're from Suburban Chicagoland and yours tummys hurt?  Come on man.  You gotta stiffen up.  Practice.  Come out to Galena for a hot minute, we'll fix ya.
“It might be tinnitus” dead
I've had two of the best dining experiences of my life at two of the three Margaritavilles I've visited.  One was at the Navy Pier in Chicago where we had an extremely flamboyant, gay, black, Southern waiter who told us a fake story about a customer's eye falling out onto the table and was impressed that my mom had apparently eaten a full plate of nachos by herself (we had all shared it, actually). The other was on Duval Street in Key West on my mom's 50th birthday, which was JULY 2020, and we sat in the table with an open window onto the street. The live musician (whose name was David Bryce Warren) played Cotton-Eyed Joe and Happy Birthday for my mom, and everyone in the restaurant ended up celebrating my mom's birthday with us, and people on the street kept wishing her a happy birthday too. She remembers that as her best birthday ever.
I just want to know if your bank called you suspecting fraud
I think the restaurant sucks. He has pictures all of himself hanging at the one in Pigeon Forge, TN 😂😂😂😂
I freaking dare you to hit up every Cracker Barrell in the US. Not possible.
this is the first video ive seen of yours and im a huge margaritaville fan n this is hilarious
I’ve been on the Dr. Seuss ride, Fish in the sink is a real one. Only guy in the whole book with a lick of common sense. EDIT: Went to the Mall of America as well, place was massive but WOW I was not impressed with Minnesota
Last Mango In Paris is a fantastic song too, and I'm convinced from this the only good one is in the Key's
I mean they didn't go to the Hawaii Margaritaville....
I went to a margaritaville back in 2005 with my family (i was 11) and i swear i became autistic, i had sensory overload with all the boomer crap. My parents on the other hand stole every Jimmy Buffet memorabilia they could lay their eyes on.
Isn't there also a Margaritaville Resort at Lake of the Ozarks in the middle of Missouri?
Awww didums
My first thought: Why on earth would you do that? Oh yeah... because you can... good enough. lol On a second note, my aunt was Hella sick after drinking at Margaritaville.
Next up: Hard Rock Café 🎸
I don't know if I can express just how disappointed I am that you didn't stop at the Margaritaville resort in Osage Beach, MO, in between Mall of America and Tulsa.
Did he go to the one in Capitola CA?!
you should go to every Bubba Gump in the us
If there isn't a margaritaville in the afterlife than I don't want it
I love it, following
Looking forward to the last piece of the trinity, The Hard Rock Café.
Hard Rock cafe next year
So at 41:41 we expose where Eddy got the inspiration for his stache.  WWJG - What Would Jimmy Grow
There’s a Margaritaville in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida Airport… Guess you gotta go back now
wait I may have not watched the video yet, but I didn’t see a location on the thumbnail map. Did you not go to the one in Medford, Oregon?
Margaritaville is a real place ? I’ve been to 1/2 the U.S. states and 13 countries and was unaware
do mcdonalds!
Basically i became an alcoholic in 50 days
Time for every Hard Rock Cafe now
This is a very long video considering the guy's not very funny.
Ok cool, now do Cheesecake Factory, but by the end of the trip, every menu item has to be ordered by either of you guys or one of the guests.
Now I cant wait for him to eat at every Hard Rock Cafe on the continent!
47:12 yep they’re twins all right, they even laugh the same lol
So the takeaway here: Margaritaville sucks lol
Now go to every Subway restaurant...
He Jimmy-ed to close to the Buffett
What’s the classical music near the start called?
Much like my grandfather, Eddy has jungle related PTSD.
There’s a margaritaville in Conroe Texas that tall missed
Very nice
I honestly thought Margaritaville was based off of a real place and not the other way around.  The gas station dog was pretty sweet though, greeting customers like his owners.  Edit: wait, did he go to the Margaritaville in Gatlinburg?
Finns up Eddy
Gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next year
2:10 stare deeply into the eyes of the tiger while you pee lol
You HAVE TO DO DICKS LAST RESORT NEXT!!!
Should’ve ended on the margaritaville cruise
Congrats....?
Every McDonald’s
As someone who has frequented the Niagara Falls location on an annual basis I’m surprised you didn’t mention the distinct stench of vomit and piss that exists in the bar on your way to the bathrooms
Fun fact about the Biloxi Margaritaville Resort from someone who lived in that area! That entire greenspace visible at 14:32 was actually supposed to be part of an even BIGGER resort. The original plan was to make a GIGANTIC complex with artificial rainforests, a shopping mall, a theme park, etc etc. They broke ground on it, and even built a few bits of frame/beams, only to run out of money. The construction site stayed vacant for so so SO long before they eventually tore it down.  Eventually, the casino across the street took over part of the area, and decided to turn a big chunk of the site into the greenspace it is today. There's a little concert venue on it, and also a restaurant on one of its borders.  And in the meantime, they decided they wanted to open a much MUCH smaller Margaritaville casino (the one picture at 15:00 ), this time on the back bay. They constructed it, and it stayed open for just a little bit before it too, closed down. I managed to go once, and there was almost no one there, despite the fact that it had recently opened.   And THEN lol, at some point they decided to just convert the pre-existing building shown at 14:32 to a Margaritaville Hotel/Resort. It was a building that was standing vacant for years and years; it was a skeleton of a casino leftover from Katrina. You can even see the old sign frames atop it (that for some reason they STILL haven't gotten rid of or converted to anything).   That of course was the one to stick, because they've expanded outward to include the little outdoor theme park, and have been chugging along ever since! I also find it very interesting because it's one of the few resorts, if not the ONLY resort on the MS Gulf Coast to not have a casino (which is even more interesting when you consider that what it tried to be...TWICE lol). It's instead more family-oriented, what with its giant arcade, its restaurant, its big pool, and its theme park.  Soooo yeah lol! It just has an insane history, and so it was awesome to see in this video as someone who's watched all its ups and downs lol! Also, love the arcade getting the proper hype because it is indeed MASSIVE.
Can't wait to do it again next year
you look like the guy in a store that my dad would try and keep me away from in the 70's.
how do you have a million subs? because I see nothing that would make me follow yet another Millennial doing a food travel show.
Next year, Eddy eats at a Mellow Mushroom in every state. Did the Myrtle Beach hurricane do it's little storm routine? They may skip it at lunch. The alarm start blasting, the storm grows loud, and a giant tequila bottle descends from the hurricane and fills up the blender.
There's a Margaritaville in Lake Conroe,Tx that wasn't mentioned.  Does that mean that your journey is incomplete.
Next up: every Hard Rock? 33 locations in the US...
"Our second, and final..."  Yet.  "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country" looms threateningly in the distance. A precocious, pernicious possibility.
I don't know if the idea of eating all that crap food or the mustache is worse....
I can't believe Eddy was at the Destiny Mall in Syracuse, NY eating crappy Margaritaville, and I DIDN'T SEE HIM THERE. I GO TO THAT MALL ALL THE TIME
these videos are just eddy's journey to fully transforming into ed kemper and his first victim is gonna be ted
i fuckin love margaritaville
16:03 is the best part
i think ted liked Margaritaville later was because of stockhome syndrome
that "Mama's happy, no more stinky feet," song SLAPS!
Do another.
Remember, you're not a conspiracy theorist if you're just positing hypotheticals
I look forward to 2024 and every Joe's Crab Shack .  Great video🎉
I can relate to Ted; I tend to get self-reflective when i get diarrhea too
Coming 2024: I ate at every Olive Garden in the country probably
Can't be real, right?
I bet the next one is cracker barrel
Next year do Hard Rock Cafe? Only 36 locations in US+Canada
Next year do medieval times?
outfit looking slick af in that intro dude
can only imagine the dedication
Margaritaville Unexpected bonus Schlatt And indigestion  Burma Shave.  This here is proof that an Asian/American fusion of Haiku and early 20th century advertising slogans will never be a thing. I tried, Ed. Lord knows I tried. My shame tastes like bitter tears and supermarket fish sticks and fries.
Next, do every Hard Rock Cafe in the US.  There's 34 of them!
I like that dog
I wonder if the fish used for the fish and chips is escolar. That stuff will give you terrible cramps and diarrhea.
Missed Middleton Wisconsin margaritaville
great tuor, the only one ive had is the ft Lauderdale airport good call excluding it
Before watching these videos I had never heard of rainforest cafe or margaritaville
Hard Rock Cafe next
Dude next year he’s going to go to every Applebees or something equally as horrible
Visit the UK and do every Wetherspoons. There's 826 of them. Spoiler - they are all awful.
I hope there next video is to go to every McDonald’s in North America
Minnesota's Mall of America location one starts at 49:55, love y'all
Don’t say final, keep it going. Some of your best content.
I bet that one guy from the hearing saw the Thing from this video and thought finally it’s time to speak my truth about the aliens and the government
Again. MORE. MORE SOUL CRUSHING CHAIN RESTAURANT ROAD TRIPS. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
If he did this with a huge chain like Applebees or Chili’s I think he’d die, but honestly I don’t know what man could live something like that.
6:34
next year you all should go to each bucees in the usa
Medieval Times would work well for this series
all i want is for them to go to every bubba gump's shrimp co next summer. i hate the place with a burning passion and i want to hear their takes.
he fuckin missed the other one in Texas, i am pissed >:(( grrr
I really hope your taking good care of yourself after a big trip like this, really eating healthy after all that sugar and fried foods.
The fact you didn’t record the little hourly margarita “show” at every location kinda makes me angry.
Waiting for every senor frogs in mexico 💀
I used to live walking distance from that Margaritaville/Casino in Tulsa,Ok..I used to work there but never ate there. Shame I live in Phoenix now.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
42:19 I can confirm. Got this at my home Margaritaville in Destin. Literally tastes like rice and watered down hot sauce
red robin's
Dang all those weeks driving around the country going to the same restaurant. that's really really tough man. idk how you survived this horrible horrible adventure.
This video was legendary, so well crafted, and all the jokes hit hard. Thank you for your service sir x]
Being from MS and hearing Biloxi pronounced wrong 😬😂😂maybe it’s just because he doesn’t have a Southern accent
copied Tednivision smh
every Burger King in the US and Canada
Now you gotta go to every bubba gump shrimp location
“Liking Buffett isn’t some weird cult thing, it’s what can fix me.”  Well played, sir.
All medieval times!!!!!
YESS POSITIVE MISSISSIPPI FOOTAGE🚨
"Tastes like Cindy Lou Hoo" I mean... have you seen Taylor Momsen?
Half as many views as Rainforest Cafe one and it's only been 7 days! great job you guys 🎉
Haha, you guys missed the Margaritaville in Palm Springs!!
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
Okay now eat at every subway.
I didnt realize the chefs table music in the background the first time I watched this.
Okay, Now I want to see you eat at every McDonald's in the country.
Justin McElroy has been real quiet since this video dropped
Next every planet Hollywood in the country
What about Hard Rock Cafe?
What a handsome guy
I was dying at the part about the thing. I've always seen those signs and wondered what it actually was.
Now I must go to the margaritavile in Cleveland. It's my hometown, and I must witness Jimmy Buffet in my home. What is he doing here?
But there's one in Galveston 😅
Bubba Gump's next
I can't see Eddy' feet at the desk during his sponsor is that because I didn't pay him to see his feet? :P
Damn, I was watching looking for the one in Osage Beach but I guess you skipped it! I live right next to it here in Missouri.
Yall missed the one at Lake Lanier in Georgia
It's bill-UH-ksi
The fact that you haven't killed Ted yet means you should probably marry him.
I feel like eddy should do something even crazier like going to every McDonald’s in the US..
My guess for next summer's trip...Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
YES!!!! Another one!!! OMFG I MISSED YOU SO MUCH you endearing weirdo!!!!❤
Chili's next year?
isnt there one in jacksonville ?
you guys  should go  to every  bubba gump shrimp co. in the world :))
I hated this road trip, _SO LET'S DO IT AGAIN BUT _*_LONGER!_*
you didn't go to the virigin islands, you're a hack
I always thought Cheeseburger in Paradise was the better song and restaurant. Shame it closed lol
This video exists in the Barbie cinematic universe for sure
What happened to Margaritaville Jacksonville, FL!?
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company is next, and then Hooters lol!
this is the last one one year later : every bubba gump  in the country
Jimmy Buffet's job is beach
This guy looks like Cinnamontoastken wtf?
teds "yeah i do" is the most genuine thing I have ever heard
Think i heard  one or two itysl references
Loool I knew a guy named binkley, I can confirm he can’t be trusted
Y’all skipped Jacksonville fl???
Hard Rock Cafe is on the horizon....
did Ted pay to see your feet?
and yet again, best meal was in the canada location.
The cat in the hat ride 😂😂😂
You should do medieval times next
That's cool an all, but what's the total margarita count? 🤨
imagine if this video got copyright claimed by margaritaville
I don't think i know who this guy is "He made "Cheeseburger in Paradise" _IT WAS _*_H I M ! ?_*
I literally stopped working at margaritaville a couple of months ago, just my luck that I’d miss this 😭
Now they need to visit every Bubba Gump Shrimp......
Oh how the tables have turned, eh Eddy?
Time to do Chucke cheese Eddy
Please never stop get like seven sponsors and literally hire a driver. Haha
Marc Maron Jr.
Twitters cooked my brain so much I laughed when Ted called the rental a dog whistle lol
Dude Dollywood rules
Id kill and also pay for a hard rock cafe road trip video
I'm happy that our generation is doing something sensible during the apocalypse. I liked when the volcano burped :).
River spirit isn’t owned by Jimmy B. The creek nation owns the casino.
Ah, the Jimmy version. I've never been to one of them, but I've been to other Margaritaville's before. Decent time
Ngl, the only Margaritaville I'd ever seen was the one in Syracuse. So imagine my surprise when the rest of them are these rediculous megaplexes
Its weird watching this video and seeing Ted be the side character, and then going to Ted's video and watching Eddy be the side character.
Came for Margaritaville…….stayed for Buc-ee’s.
I'm glad that the best foid Eddy had all trip was in the only Canadian Margaritaville and it was a take on our national dish 🇨🇦🤙😎.
So whats next? Bubba gump or hard rock?
lol you guys came down all the way to Hollywood FL my respect xD
5:07 who else thought that their screen froze
i just watched rainforest cafe video and the first thing that came out of my mouth when I saw this was "oh my god why did he do that?"
see you all next year for the hard rock cafe road trip
I have driven by the thing sign so many times being an AZ native and I've never gone in, I think I need to take some shrooms or something and go visit
Did he go to Osage beach???
Do Hard Rock Cafe next! Only 33 locations
Nice
This is the best thing ever
I bet the revenue from this video made it worth it tho lol 😅
13:49 yo, that's my name
Thank you for your service
What makes you think you have any idea about food
Isn’t there a margaritaville in gatlinburg too??
HELP!? Need help!?! DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE CLASSICAL SONG THAT PLAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO 1:50
I love capitalism but I would consider working on a farm for no salary in order to stop this kind of cancer from engulfing our nation
Every Hard Rock Café next year? 👀
Oh my god The Thing!!! Hahaha dude I grew up in San Diego, but my grandparents lived in San Antonio so that road trip was like every summer. We always wanted to see the The Thing and our parents (correctly) said it would be a waste of time and money. So…thank you for wasting your time and money for our entertainment LOL
U didn't come to capitola cali
I unironically decided to click on this. not understanding what the hell a margaritaville even was. I have since ignored all my life responsibilities including going to sleep as I am supposed to be up at like 4 AM. I don't regret this. I am now amusedly interested in jimbo's cult
Thank you for censoring your feet. I have children damnit
Points for getting a shot of that billboard in Cleveland
47:12 "Oh shit, coolest motherfuckers on the planet!!"
As a resident of ATL, I am glad our city treated you so well!
Danny looks genuinely sweaty
"this door is to remain unlocked during business hours" is so inspirational im getting  it as a tramp stamp
i am from florida and the heavy rain is actually a big deal, its so heavy you literally cannot see where you're driving sometimes
Now go to every mcdonalds.
You guys should do Bubba Gump, shrimp company next!
46:33 I think all clevelanders will appreciate that Tim misny made the cut
I used to work at the tackle shop on the pier in Panama City beach and liked going there after work
Come on... it's not that bad. Rewindulax
he missed a whole margaritaville waterpark in georgia 😭😭😭😭
Two Words - Bubba Gump
“I think you mean Pina Coladaburg, a little song I wrote 7 and a half fu&$ing years before Margaritaville was even on the map.”   - Coconut Pete, The original Island songster,
Why does Eddie look like he fully supports socialism
I got the jimmy's jammin jambalaya at the Margaritaville in the Mall of America in May of 2018 and it is the only thing I remember from that whole month because it was so bad
My boi was ahammered in nyc
I’ve always been convinced that Jimmy Buffet appeals exclusively to retired dads who only visited the Florida Keys once in their younger years, and looking into this franchise only proved me right.
you skipped the one in shreveport la...
Why the fuck did I watch this
What about nashvilles piano stairs?
OOOOF course you would give the Cleveland one a short review you Illinois native. OHIO GANG
The Cat in the Hat ride DID terrify me as a child. Glad you got to experience it!
Next year:  I ate at every McDonalds on the Planet
i'm not american - i'm not sure why i never thought margaritaville was an actual physical place lol. i thought it was like something facebook wine moms joked about.
He should eat at every apple bees that would be a amazing video
We lost our grandma for 52 minutes at the buccees in Waller last year
Please do McDonald’s next ❤
Nah mate, I clicked the video thinkin "here we go again!"
Y’all should have just canned the trip and gone to Dollywood tbh. That cinnamon bread alone is worth it.
Eddy, I want to see your bank statement because I just imagine someone at your bank being like wait is this fraud or something else?
Two combat tours; margaritaville
You visited the original jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville but not the original Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio.
im working on decensoring the foot shot of eddy.
The Aliens vs Dinosaurs tangent is hilarious
As a Biloxi native for future uses it's pronounced Bih-luck-see. Hopefully y'all get to eat some local food next time!
47:54 is where you get to witness 4 broken men in a car reconsidering everything that led them to waste away in Margaritaville
There’s another one across from Anakeesta in Tennessee!!!!!!
America's obsession with chain themed restaurants will never stop to amaze me 😅
I'm excited for the next episode, "I ate at every Taco Bell in the country."
20:15 I'm from Florida and that rains pretty tame compared to the usual
this is mega trippy
Nice the cherdleys girl ayyy
I feel bad for you.
Now do every Waffle House
omg please do Medieval Times
I dont know I think it might be next year hard rock Cafe
Saw a Margaritaville in Aruba, not one soul there.
How many pieces of flair were people wearing?
I have to ask, why a truck? The MPG can’t be good for a cross-country trip
Van Wilder saying “But why?” When the walls fell
13:21 Eddy's cannon event
Bill-uck-see biloxi
what massive corporate restaurant chain will the dynamic duo torment themselves at next?
As an Atlanta resident. I was sitting here thinking "Theyre gonna hit Atlanta Traffic"....
Go to every single Chuck E. Cheese’s
you didnt go to the one in michigan
lol. The absolute trauma from Rainforest Cafe.
go to every dicks last resort
Buddy seems like a good boy ♥️
Ok hear me out every Hard Rock Cafe 34 in the us one in canada or the 22 bubba gump shrimp companys in the us?
Speaking as someone who once went to every Disney theme park on Earth in 75 hours, I have four words for you.... Bubba Gump's next please!  I looked it up; there are 22 in the US, and they include some of your favorite spots: Universal Citywalk, San Antonio Riverwalk, Mall of America, and of course, the Las Vegas Strip!
You should go on Margaritaville at sea. It's their cruise line
Why skip the Houston area one on Lake Conroe?
Lol the cat n hat ride me and boyfriend when on that thing its wild
Bro I’m from England and I’ve had this massive red t-shirt with a parrot on the front and ‘margaritaville’ on the back for years, after buying it from a thrift shop. I searched ‘margaritaville shirt’ years ago but nothing much turned up. Didn’t know I was wearing American restaurant chain shirt for pyjamas for years until this video lmao
that bean needs a clean.
Had to watch it twice, missed the whole video the first time because of this obnoxious mustache in the way.
that’s cherdleys ex girlfriend
Sorry but you are not allowed to stop here. I expect another trip next summer. Love the Bubba Gump or Medieval times ideas ive seen in the chat.
Eww. I had no idea that there were any. And I would have guessed that they were only beaches not restaurants.
I stayed two nights at the location in Hollywood FL and the burger also gave me a stomach ache lol
Teds Rainforest Cafe idea rip off?
Next year.... Hooters
“you had self reflection on the day you had diarrhea?” that made me cackle and subscribe
Every McDonalds in US
Now do every bubba gumps shrimp location.
Damn he went to my hometown of Hollywood and i wasnt there
Cheesecake Factory or fuddruckers next
This was the dumbest thing I've ever seen  Liked and subscribed
You look fictional
Now it’s time to eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S. (and Canada)
Up next… Hard Rock Cafe
Drinking a landshark while watching this the way god(JB’s bday is also on December 25th) intended it
do mcdonald’s next!!
okay am i the only one who thought you were julien jenna marbles husband? no offenc! that mustache brought me in cuz mustache means business lol
You know the fans demand a threequel to this right? Like it has to happen. Make it happen.  We need more.
Just watching this I want to go vegan for a month to get all of this food out of my system
Videos like this and the comments made throughout really just show me how out of touch the next generation is. Completely clueless to the average American family, afraid of leaving their bubbles, and overall just have a sense of superiority to everyone else.
4:25 her chest is Jimmy buffet/10
This the biggest shoutout Syracuse gonna get lmao
syracuse!!!
alright... now do every mcdonalds in the country
man, Tucker's parents named him well. that guy is definitely a Tucker
As a Texan I feel the GOAT status of Buc-ee’s was glossed over. Their original candy is lowkey better than brand name candy. Their brisket and pulled pork sandwiches are fantastic. They sell delicious and surprisingly cheap fudge. Their selection of items is huge. Their bathrooms are always very clean and smell great. Put some respect on Buc-ee’s!
Cheeseburger in paradise is actually about a burger place in St Barths. Jimmys not the “everyman” he claims to be.
We need a CASA BONITA episode of this
I watched this video
When’s the hard rock trip occurring?
Fffffffff this show.  I couldn't even make it 10 mins. What a terrible premise.  Terrible mustache. Terrible humor.
Honest to god wondering if he slowly but surely started congratulating the food as he went on cuz he was overwhelmingly hungover the entire time
I must second a comment from earlier. Do all the Medieval Times!!!
Booked a weekend at the Biloxi resort because of this video. So disappointed the Cabana shirt won't ship in time for the trip.
Who's Bimmy Juffet?
as a lifelong texas restaurant, thank you for the bucee’s interlude
The “perfect margarita” is a specific drink, not an indication of quality
We used to have a mom and pop restaurant here called Margaritaville, until they got a cease & desist from Jimmy
Eddy no!
Jake lives!
excited for bubba gumps next year <3
As someone LOVED The Rainforest Cafe tour y'all did...oh man, I'm excited to see this one...
You guys missed the one in Conroe!
You cant be doing destiny dirty like that (its so bad)
Next you should eat at every Kracker Barrel
What a handsome guy
Good video to watch on a cross country road trip
Go to every bucees
I can't wait for the "I ate at every McDonalds in the country" video
I think both of them went crazy on this trip
next do McDonald's
I love that teds video made eddy the villain for thinking differently
Every McDonald’s next
"Our second and finale road trip" *stares in Hard Rock Cafe.....*
Buc-ees is yee haw Disneyland
Okay but why didn't you go on the Margaritaville cruise
I've only been to the one at City Walk: US, Orlando.  The nachos were pretty good.  I can't drink tequila so I had the Bahama Mama which was a bit sweet but still good.
So, did you find your lost salt shaker?
Drive a tundra next time. Youll be driving for years before it breaks
ah yes the mystery that is destiny USA in Syracuse NY
Can you eat at every dumpster in America
who cares
Just stumbled across this. Good content. Nice enough guy  But, is the mustache, glasses, tucked in t shirt, parted feather hair look done ironically? I mean, my dads friends in the 1980s looked like this. Is this BACK in syle, or done as joke?
that atlanta traffic is basically what it's like on the daily
i work like 5 mins from navy pier i had no idea there was a margaritaville there 😭
Nobody: That unemployed friend:
We salute you for your sacrifice
Now y'all gotta go to every Hard Rock Cafe
This series is becoming a summer staple! Same time next year?
Elvis is better
Please do Cheesecake Factory next!
next you should do all the bubba gumps shrimp
Just saying if you do anything like this again you should visit the 52 Mcmennamins locations across the PNW 👀
Every McDonalds in the county up next to round out the trilogy? It’ll only take about 3 years to film!
Do mconalds next
This whole thing reminds me of the part in "Super Size Me" when his doctor recommended he stop eating McDonald's food for every meal due to his decline in health.  Maybe involve a health professional if you decide to go to all 292 TGIFridays in the USA.
In the Orlando one, my family and I were eating when a man at the table next to us started having a seizure. He ended up being ok thank god!! But the entire time it was happening all that was playing was “wasting away again In margaritaville” 😅
Every Cheesecake Factory
Don't get a steak
ok now do bubba gump shrimp
I ate at margaritaville once and it did infact make my tummy hurt.
Hard Rock Cafe next!
Do McDonalds next!!!!!!
I dub you Parrotheddy Burback
My tummy hurts
is no one gonna talk about Ted’s The Thing tee shirt in San Antonio??? he really loves mascots and i respect it 😂
I think next time get some salad or just appetizers in between the food chain restaurants 😅
I was a manager for the one in biloxi with stinky feet. The arcade is that big because the owner lost his gambling license and made it an arcade. That place is wild. I had to walk by that thing every day to check on the sweet shack next to it. Creepy feet game makes some money.
hell yeah Bean representation
Can’t wait for bubba gump shrimp next year!
Yall missed one! There is a margaritaville hotel in Conroe, texas!! Just opened a few years ago!!
literally just ate at a margaritaville and got violently i’ll afterwards so kudos for doing this
Im working at a summer camp rn. Taking my campers to Margaritaville!
every hard rock cafe next
I’m obsessed!
You should do Cracker Barrel next
You are doing gods work.
14:52 amogus caught...
I cannot believe y’all stopped for The Thing 😂😭 passing those signs every time I was going to college was so nostalgic
Maybe you could go to every hard rock cafe next? Haha just kidding I don't want to put you through that
You should visit every Dick’s Last Resort, I feel like that could be interesting
"Rain is slippery, and slippery is dangerous" Another banger PSA from Mr. Burback.
The nachos. 🤤
My favorite part of this is like the diffrent stages of grief throughout this gem of a video.
Why?🥺
The blue screen is probably because the other color channels have failed, so that monitor was probably not just blue, but MAXIMUM blue.
He missed the margaritaville in lake of the Ozarks MO
as a mississippian, the pronunciation of biloxi is killing me
Youtuber goes on vacation, records it, makes enough for another vacation.
The Nam flashback in San Antonio had me rolling.
Truly wasting away in Margaritaville  And Jimmy does it using nose clams. Specifically him selling nose clams as a younger man.
“I ate at every Margaritaville in the country” …and you look like that’s exactly what you did.
You didn’t go to the one in the Detroit airport.
Eddy if you see this comment: I highly recommend visiting Dollywood. It was some of the highlights of my childhood and is a really pretty park.
I was fully expecting Jimmy to come out like Chuck E. Cheese after the volcano bit.
As a proud Canadian, Ontario specifically, please eat at all 23 Lone Star Texas Grills. They make all the servers go by made up rodeo inspired names. Big novelty sized drinks, etc. you’ll love it.
For the Tulsa location half the casino is owned by Margaritaville and the other half is native owned. I'm not surprised the quality is much better just considering how much money that casino brings in. I can't say much because I signed an NDA when I worked there but its a LOT.
Next time... Every McDonald's. I think it will only take like 12 years. Maybe a lot less if you get snacks and desserts at different locations.
These are always the best vids of the year. Hoping for Bubba Gump in 2024
Margarittabean
7:30 Pickup Trucks are so bafflingly stupid
Go on the margaritaville cruise next
I love the Gulf of Mexico. Glad you got to experience its beauty.
Next on the list, Bubba Gump Shrimp. Like 23 locations.
Now that this is seemingly an annual thing, I am looking forward to when you do all the hard rock cafes in the US and Canada. There are literally two right across from each other at the border of US and Canada at Niagra Falls.
2024. Bubba. Gump. Shrimp. Co.
The only location that matters is in The Keys =)
Aww man, I live two miles from Hollywood Florida Margaritaville. Should've given me a heads up
Next is every buc-ee’s
Its all fun and games till he learns about the Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants
No one gonna talk about The Thing..? Okay lol
LET ME SEE THOSE FEET!
@49:32 I know what's in store for you in Bloomington and it's like watching a horrific trainwreck about to happen
You should try every Bubba Gump in the nation/world next year at this rate
I’m tempted to recreate this with hard rock cafes
I just moved to Florida from California and I can honestly say this rain is no joke 😅
I spent 24 days in Hawaii this year. So similar to this but like a thousand times better.
They must now go to every chilis
So, you're going to visit every Hardrock cafe next year right?
so glad we’re finally acknowledging Chrissy’s song, I think about it every day tbh
What about the one in bossier city LA
🎵”mama’s happy, no more stinky feet”🎶
How about a Benihana trip
Jimmy Buffet looks like a fun cool Joe Biden
the contrast between the two videos has been the best part of each year
DO I ATE AT EVERY SINGLE MCDONALDS IN AMERICA !!!!
Isn’t there a Margaritaville in Latitude Margaritaville innDaytona Beach tho
I didn't see Destiny USA in SYracuse NY on this vid.  Did I miss it?
48:22 Weezer
Now hear me out… bubba gumps next
Not to be a buzzkill cuz I love your restaurant marathon content, but it's not your tummy hurting. It's your liver. Dial the alcohol back on these trips. Especially if you aren't a.normal heavy drinker.   Just looking out. Cheers! 🍹
Please, for the love of god, never do Applebee's. You will die.  Bubba Gump Shrimp though...
America is so funny lol.
next video is gonna be "I ate at every McDonald's in the country"
This eddy guy looks like an absolute dad with that stache in their 40s that just happens to have good skin then realize he's actually like 26 or something
Mr. Moneybags, Lucky Ducky, and Hot Red Ruby are characters from VGT slot machines. They're everywhere in Tulsa-area casinos and often times are integrated with casinos' promotions and themes.
Maybe the real Margaritaville are the friends we made along the way
that was the most atlanta experience ever💀💀
You actually have to watch the rainforest cafe video to understand the margaritaville video 😂😂😂
Hard Rock Cafe next year?!! 🤣
I loved whenever he saw a rainforest cafe lol 😂
I know these are hard to make but these must be so much fun.
lol that's so atlanta to get stuck in horrible horrible traffic and then meet really nice restuaurant workers.
Do medieval times
When you said you went on cat in the hat I gasped. So terrifying. Rode it a couple years ago and I still haven’t recovered. I think the cat took my soul
Okay, but now they need to finish the Mall of America trifecta and do Bubba Gump’s Shrimp
Will Eddy ever have the balls to go to every Chuckee Cheese's? I doubt it.
i've been in some pretty bad elevators built exactly like the one at around 8:00, seems to be specifically those elevators.
Fuck, you did it again!
I’ve only watched one video of yours and that’s when you went and ate at every rainforest Café now my question is why do you keep doing this to yourself?or is this your channel brand?
10:24 That's Captain Quint from Jaws, you can't fool me.
We hit the date where a joke about 9/11 is no longer too soon.  22 years.
Other people seeing this video: "Wow, that's a long trip with a lot of stops!" Me: "Oh God... he went to Syracuse."
That’s a lot of samus balloons on the thumbnail
Nothing fits better with a national tour of the king of Florida men everywhere's restaurants than that "The Thing" insane conspiracy museum.
I love how Americans are so self-centred america is now “The globe" 😂, no one anywhere other than the miasma that is the USA has ever fucking heard of this place.
52:58 blade runner vibes
Judd Nelson is doing fine i see.
39:48 was the highlight for me
As a resident South Carolinian, hearing Eddy describe "tropical locations" right before getting to Myrtle Beach had me dying.  If you know, you know.
That museum for “the thing” is starting to look less like a joke…
Don't lie. This isn't the last time
Sounds like a popular place based off the first two minutes but this is the first I’ve heard of it.
so jimmy buffet is the american hello kitty...amazing
Niagara Falls, Ontario is... different. I like it, but it's weird.
mar   margarita
Next year is every subway
I watched this video more times than I‘d like to admit😂
Sad
Sad
But you didn't go to all of them, right? Because what happened with New Orleans?
ive never been to a margaritaville but i have been to universal n i LOVE the cat im the hat ride
whats margaritaville
Next up is Bubba Gump Shrimps! I want you back up here in Minnesota!!!!
Eddy's dedication to showing off how absolutely fucked up American culture is
I fell asleep while listening to my liked videos and this video started playing and it made me dream that I had gotten violently sick at a haunted margaritaville ❤
You guys should do Bubba Gump next!
Woke up at 3am, couldn’t get back to sleep, watched this video and found it to be surprisingly entertaining. Well done.
.. pick a better chain lol
I'll be honest, I clicked on this video because I legitimately did not know there was a Jimmy Buffett restaurant chain in the USA.
next up the world
I cant wait for your trip next year!
eat at every macdonalds
Three words: HARD ROCK CAFE
You should have filmed eating at every Buc-ees. Their food is awesome.
I wish the audio was louder
Can't wait what chain restaurant they're gonna tour next year. As a foreigner who's never been to America, this is such a fun way to get to see the different facettes of the US.
this is video ever
come back next year when Eddy and Ted take on every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
next you should eat at every applebees in the country
Yum!
My condolences
47:12 lmao!
Does anyone know what the song that plays from 51:49 to 53:01 is?
Lol, y'all two fuckers did it again. This is amazing.
awesome video guys, can't wait for next year when y'all go to every single Bubba Gump Shrimp co. in the country and the one in Canada
The way he pronounces Biloxi is so wrong lol
thank you for this informative documentary on the terrors of Jimmy Buffet
I had no idea Florida had so many Margaritavilles!😳 and I live there! I totally forgot we had one at Universal Orlando, I’m a Passholder I should’ve known this🫣😂 can’t believe you pulled off another insane trip like this AGAIN!🤣 thank you for entertaining us with your misery
So Ted is an imp of Satan or something right? In both trips, he seems to exist to torment Eddy with chain restaurants and bizarre logic.
but why?
Why do you look like human version of Garfield?
The San Antonio Margaritaville got me sick as a goddamn dog.
4 mil views? Why? How would anyone watch this
45:10 - any soul left after those margaritas?, (In unison) “no”
I have never set foot in a Margaritaville and, after watching this, I probably never will lol
I like to imagine when Eddy and Ted came back to the Vegas Rainforest Cafe the employees just immediately recognized them and were like “you get the HELL OUTTA HERE!”
I would suggest you guys that for next year, visit and eat to every Forrest Gump's restaurants in the US 👀
Out of this whole video, this epic adventure of America and a chain restaurant experience, there’s one thing I will always remember.  How Eddy pronounces Biloxi, MS as if it was named after smoked salmon.
so which one will It Be next year Bubba Gump Shrimp Company,  Hard Rock Cafe‎, Joe's Crab Shack,Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament?
That intro is cinematic art at its finest
Cowards didn't go to bossier city
52:17  Ayo WHat???👀🤨😂
The way you pronounced Biloxi has me rollin'
I grew up on the border of LA and MS and hearing you mispronounce those city names made me hurt. It's not New Or Lense it's N'Wah Lense (new Oh Leenz is also acceptable but you gotta put that Cajun lean into it) And it's not bill- ox-y it's bill-lux-y
love seeing my local margaritaville resort in Biloxi. but its pronounced bilUxi not bilOxi here 😔😔 sad misconception
So you trashed the name Binkley, but the Binkley cave system (no relation) is one of the longest in the nation. Who’s laughing now?
now eat at every mcdonalds in the US and Canada
so Eddy became a serial day-drinker?
Fun and funny to watch.
If you ever feel like torchering yourself, go to every crackerbarrel in the country. Pretty large menu but I'm sure you'll get tired of it after awhile
46:31 Misny makes ‘em fuckin pay LFG!!!! If you’re from Ohio you know exactly what I’m talking about
I didn’t see anything in that truck bed.
Now you gotta do Hard Rock Cafe to complete the trilogy
Hey Eddy what happened to the video you made about NASA confirming aliens
Whats next? Hard Rock Cafe?
The execution of this pointless exercise is <chef’s kiss> perfection
WHATS GOING ON
yah that ferris wheel absolutely terrifies me every time. i hate how tall it is and i hate how it rocks back and forth
Go to every mcdonalds
Yooo i knew i recognized u from somewhere i was at islands at the same time as you
I have finally found the greatest thing on YouTube.
42:32 an other Spider-Man  Cameo among other marvel  heroes.
The alien’s definitely did 9/11 the pudding is the proof in the
Isn’t there a margaritaville in the Detroit airport too
This is kinda like the documentary super size me.
I dated a girl whos parents who were those older people that never got out of their party and drink all the time college phase and they were obsessed with Jimmy buffet when I first met her parents we met at a margarita Ville and her dad had a jimmy buffet tattoo
you need to do old spaghetti factory next!!
The sacrifices in sanity this man makes to do this two years in a row is legendary. Someone build this man a statue, moustache and all.
Eddy is perhaps the only person to ever pull off that hat
Biloxi - "beh-lux-see" not "beh-locks-see"
"The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea"
This video has me so nostalgic for going on holidays with family and going to terrible chain restaurants.
30:16 SPIDER-MAN  CAMEO!!!
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next
I live in florida and those tiki boats are dope lmao they’re basically just a bar on a boat that takes you from beach to beach
The song that no more stinky feet game plays is unsettling. Wtf
2nd and final? Nah. I’ve been trying to think of a themed restaurant for you guys to go to next… Hard Rock Cafe has way too many, Medieval times would probably be too good and planet Hollywood has too few….then I found it…. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 22 locations in America. The Canada location is in Edmonton and the Mexico location is in Cancun so you can probably just skip those haha. Life is like a box of chocolates so eat some shrimp. Has a Vegas location. Has a mall of America location. It’s perfect.
Technically, if you didn't go to Margaritaville in Montego Bay, this doesn't count 😂😂😂
47:11
Margaritaville Hotel in San Diego opens in September... better make your reservation, Eddy.
hear me out: every bubba gump, globally
Why is the only thing I've ever had from Margaritaville the one thing the employees said to steer clear of lol.   I thought it was pretty good too.
this is a masterpiece.
Now just do it with all the Hard Rock Cafes in the world.
We love you Eddie!  Thanks for letting us in on an awesome and unique adventure.  Chrissy’s tits were awesome too.  Ciao!✌️
Some other themed restaurant suggestions for next year... Bubba Gump Shrimp (23 locations in US & Canada), Hard Rock Cafe (35 locations), Medieval Times (10 locations)
Can’t wait for your 10th road-trip when you go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
teds face when you accused him of 9/11 is probably the most adorable thing i’ve seen a grown man do
Now you have to go to every dicks last resort
One must imagine Sisyphus happy
Why in the world would you do this?  I mean, as tourist trap restaurants go, margaritaville is ok.  But its certainly not worth traveling for.
I love how they establish with the chips that all they need to do for a visit to count is eat some amount of food in the restaurant, and yet they continue to make their livers beg for mercy with 2+ servings of hard liquor almost everyday for a month
Bubba Gump next. BUBBA GUMP NEXT!
Do Hard Rock next 😊
Then the one in Shreveport isn’t on the map 👀
Next: I go to every McDonalds in the country :D
I am shaken and devastated, you skipped my local margaritaville on lake Lanier in Georgia. I will never recover from this emotional blow. wth man😩
Now it’s time to go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in the US
Do it a third time. Third time is the charm
I live for this! Hard Rock Cafes next year?
create something of value ya twat. this is the dumbest thing ive ever seen.  please for the love of everything, let this trash content be gone!!!!!!  lol bless ya!
Really great video
Seeing you visit the Thing was the highlight of the video. Haha and Ted got a shirt as well!
this goddamn video has been recommended to me by the algorithm for the past week and I cant help it, im going crazy. ive succumbed
Dude keywest is so lovely that bridge hits hard driving on it
incredible journalism, this is the real america, eddy -- and you conquered it yet again.
HOLLLYWOOD FLORIDA BABYZ 954 JIT FOR LIFEE WHOHOOOOO
Hard rock cafes next!!!!!!!! Please
Nothing like a roadtrip with a Toyota Tacoma without a topper
Thank you Eddy, these make me very happy, please never stop going to insane theme restaurants around america (and canada)
No one: This guy: I'm gonna eat at every Margaritaville, so you dont' have to!!! Everyone: Uh, thanks?
imagine trying to eat at every subway in the us. it would take a year
now do every hard rock cafe
There is a Margarita Ville casino in Shreveport you guys missed.😅
gotta do every flavortown next
Looking through your channel rewatching stuff, and noticed the rainforest cafe video was a year ago. Didn't seem like it was that long ago, boy how time flies. Last July I was in a relationship, going to school, saving up some money to try and potentially buy a motorcycle. Watching you go to rainforest cafe's and laughing the whole time. Now im single, dropped out, and motorcycleless. But i can always count on my guy Eddy to continue doing stupid shit for me to fall back on.
Please tell me it's not in Ted's Taco again. Probably the worst road trip vehicle, the thirsty old girl....  You gotta be kidding me. Not even a Camry? Truck suspension just isn't meant for long trips fellas.  It'll rock those jimmy Buffett vittles like a boat at sea. Not to mention the gas bill.
wait what about the Margaitaville in Palm Springs?!
40:49 Fiction!!! 😂
Maybe for next year, the 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Lower 48? History, culture, awe inspiring nature, and you can even start in Los Angeles.
No Jacksonville Beach, FL Margaritaville?  :(
This bastard saw the Prime and Primal statues....  Sunuvabitch.
I hear they're going to have another restaurant called Jimmy's All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
who's going to tell him there's a Margaritaville cruise ?
*My god !!! THE BEAN IS DISGUSTING ! ☣Level disgusting ☣ Call that thing the BIOHAZARD BEAN !*
Oddly enough Margaritaville in Pigeon Forge TN is where I proposed to my now wife back in 2021.
Y’all should do Hard Rock Cafe next
I went to the destiny usa mall and there was a shooting that closed the mall early and we had nothing else to do
Very on brand for your Atlanta stop for y’all to get into standstill traffic as soon as you got outside the perimeter tbh
Ok now so all the red lobsters
Time to go to every Hard Rock Cafe ❤
Did you come to the one in Cleveland?
Love this! Keep doing these videos
You Should go to every K-Mart now
Or do Hard Rock Cafe, the river walk misses you 🙂
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp co next
I’m predicting the Hard Rock Cafe is next
Not again
thanks for finally showing me what was inside the thing cause i’ve lived here my whole life and pass it a decent amount but have never stopped there 💀
Can't wait for when you do every Applebee's in the US.
the drive to key west is so incredibly beautiful. i wish i could go again, i haven’t been since i was little
wait a minute, are you driving with margaritas still in the system?
I'm so glad i watched both perspectives
Dies the Margaritaville restaurant inside the Detroit airport not count cause it's in an airport?
Go to every medieval times
52:04 anyone know which song this is?
I just stole Eddy's "Pour me something" pic and quote, and I sent it to my family text thread.  My nephews think I'm hilarious.  If they those little twerps ever give me any money, I'll pay residuals to you, Mr. Burback.
Eat at every bubba gump shrimp co
Why lie about going to every Margaritaville? You skipped over Margaritaville at Lanier Islands, which is the second Margaritaville in Georgia 😫
Let’s go international and do all the Senor Frogs in the US, Mexico, Bahamas, and Puerto Rico!
holy shit i just watched this and BRO I SAW YOU!!! HOW DID I NOT NOTICE YOU!!?!??!
Now for Hard Rock hahahaha
Isn't Yacht Rock's audience supposed to be rich people? Boy, can I relate. 🙃
Well now that its over what’s the plans for next year? Fridays? Lmao.
ten stages of alcoholism
*deep breath*  “New Jersey”  What an incredible moment
I cant wait for next year when they hit every bubba gump shrimp
universal experience of a panic attack in buc-ees
seeing you experience buccee’s is so great
Buba gumps
You should go to all of the wonder works
Just started the video and you’re already wrong: I clicked on the video because YouTube REEEEALLLLY wants me to watch it, apparently.  Love you
That girl will forever be in a video digging the shorts out her butt lol
Now do Cracker Barrel
I'm really looking forward to next year's end of summer restaurant chain road trip!
hardrock cafe next?????
This was amazing. When're you getting back on the road? Can't wait for the next one! ;p
Love how Canada knocking everuthing out of the park is a constant
The random kid just walking up and playing the arcade game with eddy is so funny to me for some reason lmao
Every time I see one of this guy’s videos I feel like “yea that’s what the human embodiment of film school looks like”
When are you doing the tgi Fridays road trip
I’m just here for the sneaky Nakey Jakey content
There’s one in Missouri too I believe.
Biggest rip off in the nation. 4th of julynshow 2023 was 15 min long. After all day and much experience.  What a huge disappointment.  F. Jimmy and his wine0ville just ok resturant.
Only knew him for Cheese Burger and paradise.
Also you should do hard rock cafe next
i know you said final but what if y’all went to every planet hollywood?
Wait your friends with Jarvis Johnson? Cool.
so next year is every Medieval times dinner and tournament right?
Group bean pic look like weezer
Every McDonald’s in the US?
u should get kurtis in the next video
Rumathra ist echt fett geworden
As a southern AZ resident I love that yall stopped at The Thing?
Now you have to do hardrock 😂
"raing is slippery"....oh child it seems you have no experience with snow and ice on the road lol
@27:52 douchebag Bo Burnham wannabe
I wonder if this is Revenge on Ted for enjoying the shit out of the Rain forest cafe
as someone who worked at the mall of America its so funny seeing it be dramatized like this
wait why did you skip the one in Jacksonville Beach FL????
So when can we expect the “every Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament” video?
52:27 haa ha
your favorite quote is from alan jackson. no?
you're my favorite serial killer <3
I could have just missed it but did you miss the one in the Ozarks in Missouri?
I love how gracious you are.
schlatt without alcohol???
47:20 The scumbag who faked a speedrun
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU WERE IN BILOXI! I work next door at the casino! If you do the bubba gump tour let me know, there’s one in our casino and I’ll get you the hookup 🎉 (Also it’s pronounced buh-luhk-see!🤙🏼)
Hold up there is one in Lake of the Ozarks MO that he totally missed.
I can't believe my parents' Margaritaville house made it in this video.
Every Hard Rock Cafe
Ted pulling that roller coaster after that meal sounds dreadfull, but maybe thats just because a lil hingover
I cannot believe this man was in that traffic jam in Atlanta. I was in it too! Ahhh
Maybe the real margaritaville is the friends you made along the way
Both Jimmy and now you have cracked the code on how to get paid to waste away in margaritaville
but...why would you go out of your way to rent another truck?!?! I mean, I'm looking into switching to smart car because my nissan versa is so expensive to fill, never mind driving a truck to and fro the continent.
it would be interesting to do a full health scan prior to the trip and after... to see how much it declines 😂
You guys should do Bubba Gump Shrimp next!
Do every chilis in the US next! 😈
Now you need to go to all Hard Rock Cafes, hotels, and casinos
I have the biggest conspiracy theory about Margaritaville. The song itself despite it's tropical theme is a typical sad country song about drowning your sorrows over a woman. I firmly believe that most people are not thinking of Margaritaville, what they're actually thinking of is "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere" by Alan Jackson. Because that's the song about kicking back and not worrying about work and resting on a beach with a drink, but because Jimmy Buffet is featured in it and mentions Margaritaville the songs get mixed.
ngl the margaritaville in las vegas kinda slaps. i havent actually eaten there but i've walked by it soooo many times and been inside once before
dear America. Your portions for every person don't have to feed a family of 4.
48:21 weezer
There’s a margaritaville resort on lake Conroe in Texas though. You def missed one
Next year it’s bubba gumps
Omg the thing? Tshirt
Sooooo... where can we buy the "Feet Cut"? Asking for a friend, who is definitely a lady friend and not me.
now get a pint in every wetherspoons in the uk
I like how Eddy doesn't upload often but when he does, he does something life changing
13:53 Buc-ee’s is really the most chaotic place on the planet. We caught my grandma cheating on my grandpa there. Wild times…
do cheesecake factory
"What kind of idiot goes to every margaritaville" - my mom(a Jimmy buffet super fan) when this video got recommended on the TV
My dad as a kid missed out on going to see the grand canyon, cause my grandpa wanted to see the thing, and my dad did the exact same thing to me with the thing, and never told me what the thing was till we saw it, to say I was pissed was an understatement. Apparently that has been a 4 generations of a prank that has taken the chance to see the grand canyon for multiple families.
now do every mcdonalds
Hard Rock Cafe
Amazing. 10/10
I liked when the volcano burped :). Imagine if margaritaville had an All you can eat Jimmy Buffet.
Gotta say it, I loved your friend Schlatt as Quint in Jaws... 😉😂😂😂
Well...living the American dream
I cant believe I watched an hour long video of 2 guys going to every Margaritaville
Didn't you guys miss the Margaritaville at the Miami International Airport?
What about the Maragritaville in Shreveport, LA?
30:55 don’t worry man, had to go on that ride by myself and was terrified, but the visions will go away.
These road trip vids are really workin for ya, aren't they?
sooooo... what's the next chain restaurant?
those prices are criminal, $20 for frozen fish and chips literally how do these restaurants even stay open??
You gotta do Hard Rock Cafe
You're so right about Texans being crazy for Buccee's, when you started talking about it I LOST my MIND
every bubba gump. need i say more
Next restaurant, Bubba Gumps.
Next road-trip should be to hit every Medieval Times in the US
It's crazy to see the Atlanta location from a different perspective, I did the HVAC for the whole building but by the time I finished never got to see it fully finished
It says EVERY margaritaville but I didn’t hear the one at Broadway at the beach in myrtle beach, South Carolina. 🤨🤨🤨 (unless I’m dumb and missed it-)
RIP Eddie's liver and kidneys
Long time resident of Key West here.  I'm not surprised to see that your trip had a turning point when you got down here to the Conch Republic.  You showed great strength in being able to leave Key West.  Many residents down here came down for a weekend and never went back to the Mainland.    Fun video - thanks for making it!   Capt. Blackheart Charlie Man-o-war harbor, Key west
Comeddy
This floated in my recommended for what feels like forever but it's only been a week WUT. Anyway the godly pfp is what made me finally click and so far I'm enjoying this greatly.
Next year, Eddy finally snaps, kidnaps Ted, and travels around burning every Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville to the ground while forcing Ted to watch.
Another truly herculean task, completed. Now do another country road trip with Ted, to the same cities, and make it an actual vacation instead of self-inflicted torture.
46:32 yoooo is that my boy Tim Misny I see?
For the next one you gotta go big with Cracker Barrel
Please don't say pointless again because we all know that this Margaritaville trip and last year's trip where to make YouTube videos and YouTube videos make you money
So, like, Margaritaville is an even-weirder version of Tiki?
Hard Rock Cafe next.
Does the patreon get an uncensored version?
There have always been hypothetical scenario museums, just go to your nearest holocaust museum.  Lol
Congratulations you have totally wasted your life….And mine for clicking on this 🗑️..what purpose does this hold!? Does it cure world hunger… 🤷🏼‍♂️ homelessness… 😅
Challenge yourself next time and go to every Applebees
i wonder what chain they will take an adventure on next year
Surprised this video didn’t end with the two of you watching a bootleg of Jimmy Buffett’s musical “Escape to Margaritaville.”
Knowing you’re that close to where I live feels weird. You guys are American YouTubers, and the last place I’d expect to you to be in is the Niagara Region… it’s weird knowing this happened twice too lol
Up next: Margaritaville cruise. Apparently it’s not so good.
Fun fact... They're building a Margaritaville here in San Diego! Not sure when it'll be done, but I walked by it while listening to this video and had myself a good laugh.
You should have learned from the first their food sucks and very over expensive overrated rooms.
Syracuse in a nutshell😂
Do McDonalds next
You guys should go to every Hard Rock Cafe next
Bubba Gump shrimp next?
Hard Rock Cafe
Biloxi  is pronounced Bill-uhck-zee by the locals btw. Fins up 🍹
kinda weird you copying Ned's video just saying
Lol, he should have known about the parrotheads.
Woah was that naked jacob?!
Forgetting the whole final trip thing, you should eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp next. Because the thought of you getting to the Mall of America and seeing both of the past restaurants is hilarious
Bubba Gump next
B E A N
I used to work at the one in nyc 😂
36:17 hahahahaha
You have to make this a trilogy and go to every Bubba Gumps in the US
Cool! Next hit every Applebee's and TGIFridays in the nation.
Dude. That last shot was ominous.  Planet Hollywood is global.
The amount of Vivaldi in this video is absolutely iconic. Hope your tummy recovers soon 👍
So, when"s the hard rock cafe video?
This video is sponsored by feet finder
Did you go to the one in Conroe ? Did I miss it?
So every Hard rock cafe is next summer right?
Your name is Deep Eddy?
This is the kind of thing I would do... But not for a video. Just because I'm messed up.
I used to work not too long ago at Margaritaville in Tulsa! I watched this video solely to see what you thought lol. Cool trip!  Lowkey I’ve always loved the Margaritaville merch tho, always ended up getting blenders or shot glasses
Next year Bubbagump! Lol
honestly I would love to do shit like this if I had the money, it looks like such a struggle but also so much fun to do!
AIDS burger in paradise! 🎶 It's OK, it's not offensive, it's from South Park.
This is incredible LOL
What about Oahu?
I grew up in Shreveport, LA and I didn't know Margaritaville was a restaurant chain. Just thought it was resorts and casinos.  Also The Thing museum got a huge overhaul.
What about the South Padre location? Was it not open yet? I just went it’s pretty good
Dude who screamed at them in Chicago and was the most Chicago shit that could have possibly happened 😂
I feel like i know exactly how every margaritaville hotel smells
Now do Bubba Shrimp.
What about the Margaritaville Resort in Lake Conroe, Texas? Asking for a friend.
Is that chribbleys
Legend
Absolutely obsessed with these
Is it just me or did they miss the Margaritaville in Missouri?
Given that Margaritaville is about literally wasting away as a beach bum because you're an alcoholic, I will be disappointed if by the end, Ed isn't wasting away on a beach somewhere.
Visit every McDonald's next
Now time to do a road trip to Every Casa Bonita!   Should be super simple!
Hard Rock Cafe next?
This guy is trying so hard to be creative
If your mother was dead and cat in the hat was franticly telling you she was there it would be such a traumatizing experience for a child.
Cheesecake Factory next year?
Petition for him and Ted to do every mcdonalds in America and Canada, like here.
off topic but absolutely recommend dollywood! it’s super clean, the rides are fun and i honestly enjoy it more than disneyworld. also they have this cinnamon bread that is made throughout the whole day that i would kill a person over
Do Dave and Busters next.
coming to a standstill on the interstate to atlanta is such an atlanta thing lol
Why??
YOU'ER LAUGHING?! HIS TUMMY HURTS AND Y'ROU E LAUGHING!?
Never listened to Jimmy Buffett or been to a Margaritaville, but after watching this video Margaritaville was the 3rd song on the radio during my commute. I'm scared.
So every hard rock cafe next year 🤔?!
"And on our way traffic completely stopped" that's Atlanta for you, 24/7.
Do Mcdonalds next!!
Imagine if Margaritaville had an All you can drink Jimmy Buffet
What an awesome video and I’m happy to be a new sub to the channel
The question is never why, only why not.
11:14
I'm not a fan of yours, I've seen like one or two of your videos, but I've seen your videos recommended to me many times, and it just struck me how you always look like you're suffering in the thumbnail. You always look like you regret ever making a youtube channel, but, fuck it, you've just gotta keep going now because this is your life now. You look like you'd rather be doing anything else than create content so that these faceless people on the internet can laugh at your suffering in order for you to earn yet another paycheck.  So just. like. are you okay, dude?
Why must you do this to yourself
Can’t wait till you get to the one in the middle of nowhere MO after so many major city beach 🏝️ locations, 😂
Thank you for wasting away your life at tourist traps for our amusement, could you do every Hard Rock Cafe next?
Obviously gas mileage wasn't important to this duo because there are way better options than renting another Tacoma haha
amazing trip now do hard rock cafe
They're opening a new margaritaville hotel in Newport Kentucky so you absolutely have to go when it opens
I’m not kidding I swear I saw you guys at pidgin forge but at the time I only watched Danny, missed opportunity tbh
booked a trip to Margaritaville after this
I dare you to got ever hard rock cafe in the WORLD!!!!
My man didn't even go to the Margaritaville in Louisiana
I'm concerned that every time you cut to highway footage you're on the left side of the road. The right lane is for driving and the left lane is for passing. Move to the right if you're not passing anybody.
One more roadtrip...all Medieval Times in the US
The toes are for Patreon only I assume
ALL BUT the one in  Conroe Tx.  What a waste :(
My god, you actually did a second one after Rainforest? You absolutely insane, beautiful, nutjob.
I just went to the Destin margaritaville, the margarita wasn’t bad
As someone who lives near Biloxi I both hate and don’t blame them for saying the towns name wrong. Mississippi has some bullshti town names
Planet Hollywood trip when!?!?!?!?
You should go to all 32 Hard Rock Cafes next
Can you imagine going to Orlando for the first time since your mom passed and experiencing the cat in the hat screaming "ITS YOUR MOTHER YOUR MOTHER IS HERE!" At you after a 10 minute acid nap
bro quit bithcing the longest stretch ive done road tripping is 23 hours driving me and one other homie drove in shifts and napped we went from california humboldt to new orleans with stops and visits along the way
bro found religion
So... Bubba Gump next year?
U missed the one in south padre
Bubbagump
Go to every Six flags across the country next!!
Bubba gump shrimp?
why would they call it a cheetahrita and not a margacheeta… thats fucked up
Another "reasonable" one might be Bubba Gumps.  34 of them.
Who knew that I've secretly been training myself for something like this... growing up in the south I'm used to heavy fried foods and alcohol every day of my life!  Eating fried food for lunch and dinner and doing a bar crawl at night sounds like a normal weekend at college
IM NOT EVEN GOING TO WATCH THIS SHIT BECAUSE YOU DIDNT COME TO PENSACOLA, WHERE JIMMY IS FROM!!!
Bubba Gumps next?
Eddy I’ve been to Dollywood. It’s rad.
The manager at the Atlanta Margaritaville only wanted a good Google and Yelp review, but you did them one better lol...  No but seriously, if I'm ever in Atlanta, definitely going there... What legends
Can't wait for you to come back 1 year later with "I ate at every Chuck E Cheese in the Country"
Every McDonald's in the country next?
Every buba Gump in North America? There in Mexico
Next year do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
so you went on vacation
I didn't know The pina cola song guy had a restaurant franchise
Love seeing eddy slowly being converted to this cult
Went to the Key West location in 2009. Used a fake ID to drink. Great times
Well I'm from Florida and the rain sucks. We are in agreement. It's slippery, it's dangerous and it sucks
Can’t wait for next year’s adventure
I know this is a long shot but you should really get in touch with the good boys at Podcast: The Ride! You would be a fantastic guest!
Next year go to every dicks restaurant in America
Stopping halfway through the video to say Eddy, my man, that is NOT how you pronounce syracuse.
Hearing Eddy say "rainforest café" gave me ptsd
I’ve never been to one before and maybe after watching this video I will never need to🤣
Wtf is margaritaville? I can’t imagine how bad it must be. Probably like a crappy version of applebees. 😂
Long John silver
Y’all missed margaritaville lake Conroe. Terrible video, sorely disappointed
He’s now fully assimilated.
A margaritaville employee informed me yesterday that youll be doing bubba gump next. Saw the boat table you sat at in city walk was right next to the long yellow table they sat at in the show Jury Duty!!
There is a Panama City Margaritaville - I didn't see this one on there?
My Jimmy's Jammin' Jambalaya in Panama City Beach was actually really good and looked like the photo on the menu. Yours looks awful. o-o
final??
Now do every McDonalds plz
Next year do bubba Gump shrimp
Was there any giant price differences between the Margaritavilles?
why is no one talking about the pronunciation of biloxi lmao
This makes me want to go to Florida and New Orleans
Please go to EVERY MEDIEVAL TIMES !!!!!
You guys skipped Air Margaritaville inside the airport In Detroit!
You should start taking fiber with these meals lmao Do you guys ever stop at a laundromat on these trips
Missed the Bossier Margaritaville
Unless they closed it down, you did not eat at every margaritaville. Mohegan Sun in Connecticut has one.
I can confirm that the Margaritaville in the San Juan Airport in PR has the exact same if not worse vibes than all of these
Next year: "I ate at every Wawa in Delaware"
Now take a photo out front of every mcdonalds in the US!
IHOP next !
Anyone else pissed off by his mispronunciation of biloxi?
Hard Rock cafe next year?
I'm so sorry, has the colon cancer kicked in yet?
cant believe you would order fish in texas
Do bubba gump shrimp next!
im glad you finally found peace, and remember *Jimmy loves you*
The stomachs ache was him metamorphosing into jimmy
Okay but when are you doing all the Hard Rock Cafes?
Whats crazy.. is they spent so much fucking money on that museum about "the thing" rofl
Eddy is like an 8 year old boy who wished he would turn into every Chicago sports fan ever. And I love it.
I went to the Myrtle Beach margaritaville as a kid and remember for some fucking reason that I was scared of the hurricane on the ceiling 😭😭😭
There's a Margaritaville, the other one, the tequila. up on lake Lanier and it's terrible
54:39 girl dinner giiiirl dinner
Twin Towers part, not cool man, at all.
The hurricane at the Myrtle Beach location at one point had its own thunderstorms. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for yall to experience that, but I guess a wet burger is close enough
Next up......every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S??
There is no drinking like hard midtown drinking.
Some are saying you got the time square location closed.
Planet Hollywood shown in the final Vegas clip and at 58:11 he says “planet” See you there next year, buddy
Jimmy is not a musician; He is a vibe curator
Wait what about the Margaritaville in Shreveport?
Texas native here, and I just don't get the Buc-ee thing. It's a gas station. The restrooms are nice though. I guess that's enough of a shock to warrant a craze.
I wonder which "final" road trip will be next.
Can’t wait for “I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country” next year
Now do every McDonalds!
missing the cruise ship!
I have only been to margaritaville in Key West, and the margarita was out of a bottle mix.  So I don't recall the food, but the takeaway was margaritaville was not my bag,  baby
It's good to see Tom Selleck enjoying his retirement by eating at all these chains.
I hope Kyle Kinane sees this video.
leave it to atlanta to be the place y’all get stuck in standstill traffic. i love this city 😍
Now do every McDonalds
Just now found the channel. I’m getting MAJOR discount CinnamonToast Ken vibes.
im from myrtle beach and im very offended by the lack of mention of the hurricane in the myrtle beach Margaritaville that goes off every 30 minutes. Also thought you should be aware of the other jimmy buffet themed restaurant that used to be here, called cheeseburger in paradise!! it was themed the exact same way and for some reason my 10 year old self was fucking obsessed with it and I went there all the time and dreamed of working there?
Dude, I half got scammed by the asshole outside the Margaritaville in Key West, guy abuses and uses his Parrots for money. I was taking a video of the surrounding area, and he said that I had to pay to take photos. I told him I took no photos, well he took my arm but before I just let it happen like a dumbass, I asked him if this was charged, guy assured me no. He put his parrot on my arm and then asked for a 'donation' instead. Gave the dude 5 bucks thinking I got just flag it on my bank account in the car -___- I was born in Key West too so that's extra embarrassing to fall for shit like a tourist.
do hard rock cafe next
Why?
I just started watching this video, but if he doesn’t end this by going on the Margaritaville cruise then that’s a wasted opportunity.
Here is a little fun fact for you: Mexicans do not now, nor did they ever, drink margaritas . It is purely an american cocktail. Go to into any mexican bar that does not cater to tourists and they have no idea what you are talking about.
Go to one of Guy Fieris restaurants!! He has a ton of different restaurants like Pizza Chains, Smokehouses, A Mexican Restaurant, but my favorite… the Chicken Guy! I feel like you should just go to one of the restaurant types but if you went to all of them, it would be pretty tough!!
I could have easily watched an hour long video of this.
missed fort lauderdale airport
😂 God forbid they do sum with over 30 branches
Did you guys account for the hotels in this? Or just the restaurants? Because there's a hotel and restaurant combo in my town you guys didn't cover
After 6 days of eating meals prepared for me and drinking every night, this 7th night of drinking and food is exactly what I needed to ease myself
Holy crap, The Thing attraction has come a long way.  When I went, it was 3 or 4 ramshackle metal sheds behind the gas station with no unifying theme.  There were no dinosaurs or aliens, but they had an 1800s pistol and a letter the owner had sent a loved one about killing Indians.  There was an amateur log carved diorama of a medieval torture chamber from a local (contemporary) artist.  They had a junked car Bonnie and Clyde had allegedly used, and it just kind of went on like that until it anticlimactically ended with The Thing, which just sat in a hip high graffiti etched box with a glass top.  It had a plaque, but none of the production shown here.  Each shack had rattlesnake warnings posted at the open doors, and the whole thing cost 1 dollar.  No air conditioning outside the giftshop.
Next is every McDonald's in the country.... AND CANADA!!!!
every hard rock cafe next
i watched this... And i've never even heard of Jimmy buffet or his music, or this restaurant... seems like a terrible place with microwave food?
next year is bubba gump shrimp
Fins up
Ahhhh… New Jersey.
There are 6 Medieval Times Dinner restaurants in the US and Canada 🤔
i don't know how this video ended up on my recommended video list but im glad im here
I wonder what excitements await for us next year.
Did he miss the one in Oklahoma?
How much for the uncensored version of this video? Asking for a friend
It's Buh-lux-ee not Buh-lox-ee Mississippi :)
Youre right. It is. Its a cult and im never leaving it
These videos give me a bellyache.
Tow truck took Ted's Two Thousand Two Toyota Tacoma.
What next? Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?
this was absolutely insane…now eat at every bubba gump shrimp in the us
This guys so afraid of being seen as a corporate schill yet has given margaritaville a boost in advertising.
I got drunk at the Hollywood one, rode a bunch of motion rides at Universal Studios, and threw up in the Harry Potter bathroom. 11/10 would recommend
Missed the one in Honolulu….
Great vid, an appropriate follow-up to the Rainforest Cafe odyssey! I'd suggest adding chapters/sections to indicate different Margaritavilles in different cities, for easier scrubbing. Keep up the awesome work man!
My parrothead dad would be so proud if he were still alive (Jimmy Buffett did not contribute to his demise [as far as I know])
alright so whats next years road trip?
Jimmy is a songwriter and author and also composer and he believes album 💿 are book 📖.
Syracuse is pronounced "Sarah-Qs" not "Sera-cuuuse"
Did he ever get a hurricane??
Vivaldi at the beginning was genius. Was hoping for some Zadoc the Priest for the last stop.
THAT JAMBALAYA LOOKS NAUSEATING!!!1!111!
I miss Biloxi.
Wait, you went to the Mville in downtown Atl but didn't stay at the Mville at lake lanier islands?  This entire trip is a farce and a fail!
I suggest Hard Rock Cafe for your next adventure
Hard Rock Cafes next
🤩
“You can’t see my toes you don’t pay me” *subscribes*
The volcano nachos are badass lmao
Me: *glances at thumbnail* oh maybe I’ll watch the rainforest cafe videos agai- *sees it’s not rainforest cafe* ….Eddy why
EVERY BUCEE’S LOCATION….GO
Also don't forget they now have Margaritaville cruises too!
This made me nauseous 😭 you guys are troopers
Hard Rock Cafe next
There is a Margaritaville in the making in Fort Myers Florida. I know, because I live here and I'm excited for the tourist it will attract 🤑
I live like two minutes from the River Spirit Casino in Tulsa! Usually get pretty decent acts
I'm happy that our generation is doing something sensible during the apocalypse
Who’s gonna tell him about the Margaritaville in the Puerto Rico airport? 🧍🏼
Hear me out on this Eddy - eat at every Cheesecake Factory and see if you can eat all the items on the menu.
Glad to know that your name isnt just Eddy, but DEEP EDDY
Someone call the doughboys and get these guys on there.
It seem like he keep eating the same thing at every restaurant I would try everything on the menu at every restaurant
diarrheaville
He's wasting away in another margaritaville, searching for his new subscribers and views. Some people say there's an algorithm to blame, but he knows   it's his own damn fault.
6:57 that dad energy is killing me and I love it
my wife and I went to the one in Niagara Falls Canada, it was incredibly underwhelming, like Jimmy’s music
THE THING MENTIONED!!!!
hard. Rock. Cafe.
You still have to go on the margaritaville cruise.
Bubba Gump Shrimp next😌
I loved your Rainforest Cafe trip. I specifically clicked on this one because of the Myrtle Beach, SC location - only Margaritaville I've ever been too and I was curious how it compared to all the others. Excellent vid, as usual! I literally laughed out loud at so many parts of this video.
eddy were did u get that overshirt
Can't wait for the inevitable 'I visited every Bucky's in America' video
I'm just waiting for the episode in which you go to every McDonalds in the country.
Wait until he finds out Jimmy's sister has her own restaurant too 😂 Lulu's
How much for the uncencored feet video?
Buc-ee's nuts are yummmy
Do Sizzler next year ❤
"Landshark fish N chips" gave me food poisoning once 😂  never again 😫🤌
Next try every McDonald’s in USA lol
21, NYC is closing.
“Bill-ahk-see”
That giant blender in the vegas location has a water slide that a woman in a bikini will occasionally slide down and into the blender. Thought you were holding off on vegas for that reason alone haha.
Should do hard rock cafe next year. Just looked it up and they have 34 locations.
The amount of times I've watched both of your guys video on this. I've fallen asleep to it every night so far
i saw your toes... i have the app that reconstructs blurred feet. Thank you
Why?
I’m pretty sure everyone from Arizona has some sort of experience with The Thing i remember begging my parents to go to it (They didn’t take me so i’m putting them in a home in a few years).
This is incredible… I was looking forward to Jax Beach Margaritaville hotel bc it’s super new and I live here but I now see there are a million in Florida, of course
I basically hear That Chick Angel's Margarita song behind this whole video 🍸🍸🍸🍸🍸
I nominate a road-trip for every HardRock Cafe for Eddy to do next! I absolutely love your content and editing style the rainforest video and this one made me a subscriber!
There’s one of those Cool Guy Dancing in Traffic guys in every city.  Drugs are involved.
Its Biloxi ( Bill- uck-ci) . I have never heard someone say the city like that before. Anyways for that treason can you visit every Raising Cane's in North America so far.
Censored toes, comedic gold!
The Buc-ee's interlude. I feel so seen.
Nice
as a texan ive never even seen a bucees
So... how much to see the toes?
you're a good man
I just lost so much respect for books that are New York Times Bestsellers when I saw that title on the top of the Jimmy Buffett book “Tales from Margaritaville”.
Hard Rock Cafe roadtrip when?
That's cool. But can you eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country?  That's what I thought.
I don't know what the hell they were serving, but a cheeseburger in paradise has lettuce and tomatoes, Heinz 57 and French fried potatoes, a big kosher pickle and washed down with a cold draft beer, not a pre-mixed margarita.
Can’t wait for “we visited every bubba grump shrimp in the country”
i recognize that tree in vegas! its outside a burlesque show!!
The mustache isms cool but the hairs a little much
Now do Wahlburgers or TGI Fridays.
first beer i ever had was at margaritaville when i was like 10, my grandpa snuck it to me. now im an basically alcoholic but its still a good memory
What about the one in Pensacola, FL????????
Huh
MISNY MAKES THEM PAY
Got your video for next year, every bubba gump shrimp co restaurant in the US... Life is like a box of chocolates ⛵🦐  Visit places like times square, navy pier,  and Orlando... doesn't that sound fun 😏😎
This looks like how humans get parvo.
Now for the next trip do every McDonalds across the US!
"The Final Margaritaville" sounds like a crappy but charming Dark Souls DLC.
I will be patiently waiting for the Bubba Gump's edition next year.
Unbelievable this American bad taste all the way down the road. It's the worst tradition in pop culture, this meaningless kitsch. You don't see this in Europe. Here you find a different kind of bad taste.
just hey im eddy and im jimmy's B***H
You didn’t go to the one in the Detroit airport 😔
If you decide to come to the Boston location to finish the complete journey. let me dine with you. I'll pay :)
Ted and Eddy make such a lovely couple ❤
Next challenge is going to every Hard Rock Cafe in North America
I loved the Rainforest Cafe video, and I watched this one with my mom and she found it hilarious. Thank you for the family bonding time over your treacherous journey. 😂
Legendary
Heres an idea.. Rent a car with a TRUNK. srsly, why
Time to go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co!!!!
As someone from Myrtle Beach, you sandwich at the Myrtle one kinda sums up a trip to Myrtle, wet and bland😭
Next year:hard Rock cafe
If you have a margarita every night you won't feel like shitting your pants in the morning, eventually.  That's a Loser tip for ya.
Always fun to see Eddy lose his sanity each year. I wonder which chain will break his will next year.
These aspartane commercials are really fucking weird and shady. Who are these asshole actors making these things?!
2nd and final? But you can't stop at 2.... now we need a third and final trip next year in 2024 to complete the trilogy!
eddy’s tummy over the course of this video  📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉
bubba gump shrimp co. next year?
Did you visit the Margaritaville in the San Juan, Puerto Rico airport?  Your journey isn't over.  Yes, Puerto Rico is in the U.S.
You should go to every McDonald's in the country.   (Ignore the fact that there are like 13,000 of them)
You should do Bubba Gump next. There's a location in Canada :D
now take the trip to flavor town and visit every guy fieri restuarant in the world. This could be replicated with several celebrity chefs. Im talking gordo, im talking, fuck idk other people you get the idea mustache god. 3
The cheeseburger in paradise is so damn good I can't believe you thought it was just ok, and the Havanas and bananas drink is one of the best on the menu
Can't wait for next year's "I ate at every Bubba Gump in the Country". See you then.
no one bumped Jarvis' glass during Cheers Time :(
Oh man, as far as chain restaurants go, I think another challenge could be to try ever Bubba Gump's in the Country. Honestly pretty okay!
A masterpiece, brilliant
Next eating at every hard rock in the world
you know this all started with your repeated viewings of Morbius, right, Eddy? you're pushing the bounds of human tolerance, eventually your mind will break and you will become an elder god of tolerating corporate bullshit. and we will be humbled before your presence.
Hey, if you had waited a few months you could have added Ocean City, Maryland to the list... Yes, the Buffet Empire is still propagating.
We need a Hard Rock Cafe tour to complete the trilogy
The reason the Biloxi margaritavile was shut down was they used to have live shows in there and some girl was hanging from a hook as a stunt and fell off and got sued
I wish I was this rich
The skits where he stares at things are pretty good
Isn’t there a margaritaville at the lake of the Ozarks?
So..............what's next year?
i feel like this is a perfect setup to you and ted going to every chuck e. cheese in the us/ca
Next margaritaville cruise 🤣
honestly shout out to the atlanta margaritaville
Biloxi is pronounced bil- uh -xi
This is like the Pokemon Blue of road trip videos
missed lake of the ozarks
Yo wait they forgot the margaritaville in Puerto Rico….
Next up dudes gotta hit all the Bubba Gumps
Last time?  Idk we'll see about that.  These videos get a lot of attention.  I don't even follow him , but I've watched both road trips.  They literally ended the video looking out at Planet Hollywood.
52:57 blade runner 2049
If you two don't do this for a 3rd year, I'll unsub! I swear it! You better watch your sub count, buddy!
46:09 "I Saw this skunk on they way" lmao, I was in Canada last month and I saw one too. My sister thought I was delusional
I look forward to more themed restaurant tours after some recovery time has pass like hard rock cafe, medieval times  or other.
Funny enough I actually met jimmy buffet at the margaritaville in Hollywood and told him “ I love what you’ve done with the place” and he loved it
missed Margaritaville Beach Resort on South Padre Island
I don't know why he's acting like he's done? There is still 20 something Bubba Gumps to do. This series calls for a trilogy.
Cameo by Jakey!
I can't wait for next year when they do this again
A cook was fired each time you insulted the chicken.
I love that rainforest cafe has become Eddy’s Vietnam
Traffic terrible in atl??? Whaaaaa??? Noooooo neverrrrrrrrrr    I’m from atl and am moving in the fall. Thank god.
Nice
I had a bad experience with the one at Universal Orlando, I always end up going to Bubba Gumps there.
What about cheeseburger in paradise
If anyone knows who Tony Schnur, aka Thick44, is from Neebs Gaming… this would be his personal hell. #beachburgerinburgerbeach
We need a season of this
43:44 yooo the Transformers statues are in Times Square? I had no idea
"Final" yeah sure it is. Can't wait till you eat at every Wafflehouse in the country.
bro seeing you drive past my old dorm room in Atlanta is crazy
I mean, at this point, you kind of HAVE to do this for bubba gump
He should do bubba gump shrimp next
Nothing better than having a cheese burger in paradise..
cheering screaming yelling at the top of my lungs seeing the san antonio margaritaville. i eat there or at one of the mexican restaurants down the river every single time i go to san antonio. it's like the only place you can reliably get a table with little wait and have good jambalaya. i love that place
Next do Bubba Gumps :D
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
So Eddy. I let it slide on the last video. But why on earth do you say “sand-widge”?
I am convinced that America is not a real place. How do these kind of chains exist? This is was amazing though
This whole video is a lie, you didn’t stop at the one in Shreveport, LA. Sham.
Thank you for not recording the random child who inexplicably came up and started playing that arcade game with you lol
This was so entertaining to watch.
36:38 thats the saddest $20 salad ive ever seen in my life
Every time I walk by the Margaritaville at Destiny in Syracuse I will remember this video, knowing I was in close proximity to a place where Eddy was once in close proximity also.  Fun fact: According to our local newspapers, they owe over $1.5 million in back rent payments to the mall.
Time for Hard Rock XD
That Lady Liberty with the margarita glass is rad as hell, ngl.
I got diarrhea just watching this video
Great video but i gotta say man it’s incomplete because you did not go to the margaritaville at sea
You should look into the yellow deli chain literally run by a cult that would be an interesting video.
Please let the corporate office know what the Atlanta location did for you, it may do nothing, but who knows
the one time I went to the Atlanta MArgaritaville we got sat and didn't see a waiter for 30 minutes so we left
Just to end it on a trilogy, you could do bubba Gump shrimp. They have 22 locations and they have a bunch in Florida
Bubba Gumps next
28:48
Once again you come to Niagara Falls and you don't let me know that you're here.    But I am so happy to hear that you had a really good time and that our restaurant didn't disappoint.    We are Two for Two, baby!     Canada loves Eddy!  ❤️✌🏻🇨🇦  (Promise me that when you come back and do Hard Rock Cafe, you'll let me know!)
I’ve only ever eaten at a margaritaville once and it was in Panama. It was so mediocre and expensive lol.
all mcdonalds when
Next up: Medieval Times
I vote for Joe's Crab Shack or Bubba Gump next
So we are all just waiting for the "Eating at every McDonalds in the USA" 😅
I already have next years idea… Hard Rock Cafe
Great now I wanna go to a margaritaville that’s closest to me in California
Biloxi loca! Glad y’all came! Hope you’ll come back!
I’m convinced that Ted is secretly a demon, who feeds off Eddy’s misery and chain restaurants. Don’t think for a second this trip happening a year later is a coincidence. It’s Feeding Time
what woman hurt you....
the pensacola beach location was rebranded just last month, if youd done this just a month or two sooner you could have potentially eaten at 3 locations in one day. pensacola is literally right next to panama city
How are you walking times square drunk? That was the was horrifying part of the video
Hard Rock Cafe next?
Nice
I legit thought the rainforest video was only a few months ago 😂
Every Bubba Gump next
You and Ted did this again? Unreal hahaha. I can't believe you put yourself through this a second time.
this is my favorite anime
The manager at the Atlanta restaurant is a true hero. So cool of them to make you food while the kitchen was closed, and to show hospitality just for a decent review. People like that are rare and should be treasured.
ted is a city girlie
Why does this have so many more views than the original video?
I'm just so tempted to suggest more restaurants, but for the sake of your sanity, i'll be respectful and truly let this be the final trip
Every Hard Rock Cafe?
I think everyone forgets or doesn’t realize that there was a MARGARITAVILLE BROADWAY MUSICAL!!!
You're not done. BUBBA GUMP Shrimp Co!
I absolutely agree with Pigeon Forge having the same vibe as Wisconsin Dells. Both are so nostalgic.
Key West is a crazy location to drive to.
Now time for every medieval times!
Hate to call you out but the title is in fact a lie. You did not cover every single one. One opened in Lake Conroe, Texas 2 years ago.
Watched 45 minutes and finally you got to Syracuse and gave the exact review I was expecting.   It's the only Margaritaville I've been to and it does suck.
Who Hash is screaming “Potion of Shit Your Brains Out”
every hard rock cafe coming next year??? :)))
When are you gonna make these in 4k?
do cracker barrel next year!
I’ve stayed at the hotel connected to the margaritaville in Niagara Falls and man was it annoying. Just Jimmy Buffet playing all night long lol
I can't wait for "I ate at every McDonnalds"
I'm surprised you didn't waste away before the tour ended
How much did this trip cost??
Medieval times next year???
Can't believe you stole this idea from Ted Nivison.
do bubba gump shrimp next
super weird but I kept on seeing Griffin McElroy's face reflected in all of the menus???
Missed the one in Jacksonville, FL
Y'all need to do every bubba gumps now
I will invite you and Ted to our wedding if you do every Bubba Gump shrimp.
49:22 you guys both had a mild case of food poisoning. Because the effects of food poisoning can range from mild sickness - death it is always best to let the establishment know that their food made you sick so they can subvert a potential major issue.        You'd also probably get some coupons for more fish and chips too!
Did you miss the Margaritaville in Lake Conroe, Texas?
the video we all didnt know we needed
I always interpreted the point of the margaritaville song being that all though it seems like paradise it’s actually a kind of purgatory in which you do the same things over and over again until the activists that were once pleasurable became boring, so it’s kinda weird that that concept has been turned into real places
“For the second, and FINAL TIME…” yeah, I doubt that, Eddy
So people in Texas really do wear cowboy hats, I lost my mind in a St. Augustine Florida Bu-ee’s and spent $100 in there! Yeah the Destin-Panama Beach area is really beautiful beaches and water that’s like the Caribbean I have stayed and eat at the Margaritaville in Pigeon Forge my meal was crap there but I loved the resort stay!
This is like the Lewis and Clark of exploring over the top bad food quality food chains
pretty cool
Can't wait for the "Going to every Buc-ees in America" video
I love these videos America is so surreal
Do McDonald’s next
next time you should do mcdonalds
“Eating at Every Hard Rock Cafe in the US” when?
You should eat at every chuck e cheese in America. Idk. Sounds fun.
jungle jims next?
Jimmy Buffett also tried to do Cheeseburger in paradise restaurants and they where horrible. The one somewhat nearby is now a Chinese Buffet.
He's Margarita-pilled
do Johnny rockets next year
i lost it after that solo green screen photo op. great video
As a canadian I am so glad that both trips the Canadian restaurants were winners! Canadian American chain restaurants ftw.
Your next video should be visiting all the hard rocks cafés in America
you sir, I hate to tell you are a monumental waste of space. Please never do this again as this was agonising to watch and I now understand why the soviets wanted to blow up this nation of yours
Can you imagine a world where the technology and ambition to make this sort of video was paired with the heyday of sit down restaurants such as these Margaritavilles?  A girl can dream…
I live just west of Destin, Florida, and I've never been to the Margaritaville there (or any Margaritaville for that matter). I might just have to go to it after seeing this video, although Destin in the summertime is tourist trap hell, so I'll have to wait until at least October.
Next Eddy goes to every Medieval Times
Best line :the day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?
Never went to the one in Puerto Rico 😢
Chile... I don't know HOW this showed up on home page and I truly don't understand why I clicked on it... I literally LOL with occasional tears throughout this entire nonsense.
So what will be next years restaurant?  Hard Rock Cafe?
The food photography for these videos is done with a nauseated camera.
glad you enjoyed Canada
hard rock next?
Next do every michelin stared resturant in the country.
This was amazing, thoroughly enjoyed this.
You gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next, though one is in Hawaii so it may not be possible to do every location. But Bubba Gump's is also another great option...
What’s next all the T-Rex Cafes?
Go to every Applebees
I'm sad to hear the fact that Jimmy Buffet once got shot at once while flying his plane wasn't mentioned
Just wasting away in margaritaville
I live in the Myrtle beach area and I’ve only been to Margaritaville once. You’ve gotta go to the Land Shark Bad and Grills now!
Beautiful, we need another.
How much for da toes?
this was a masterpiece eddy
As an 05 Tacoma owner, I understand you Ted.
My kinda video
We are seeing the process of a man slowly turning into a cult member.
Every time a meal was actually good I got such a burst of secondhand glee
Medival Times next?
Y’all missed the one in Conroe/Walden Texas! Though I think they call the restaurant something different then the resort portion. It is a full blown water park on the lake at least with a resort.
Humbly requesting that this get a third installment to be a true trilogy. My suggestion is the medieval themed dinner + show, Medieval times. There are 10 locations, 9 in the US and 1 in Canada
Cheeseburger in Paradise
Time for every Hard Rock Cafe
aight, see ya at bubba gump next year
IQ starting off strong with the renting a pickup truck for a month-long road trip
you guys gotta do bubba gump shrimp co. next
When I see people doing things like this with their free time it makes me think "why not war?".
several days ago I glimpsed a massive margaritaville neon sign propped up in the windshield of possibly the sketchiest RV I’ve ever seen in my life. then this video popped up on my feed. A literal sign to watch this
1:03 yup heard of him did not know he was a singer 😳 🤔
Just because you have a huge mustache doesn't mean you are objectively right about everything or that your opinion is more worth listening to than anybody else's.
As someone from Mississippi Eddys pronunciation of Biloxi is both accurate to its spelling and insane to hear
22:10 I wish I could be a fraction as cool as him
Bahama Breeze's 43 locations next? 👀
I'm twelve minutes in. Thumb up.
My intestines would not be able to handle this. Hats off to you 🫡
I love you guys but hero's harbor is not where you were. It was Broadway at the beach. Hero's harbor is just a "neighborhood" of the area. Now eat at every McDonald's in the country
So Bubba Gump is next?
fuck road trips. i would rather spend that time huffing carbon monoxide. An infinitely more productive and healthy way to spend my time.
Don't say final time Eddy.
What's next? Every medieval times in America?
I climbed that Volcano rock wall, and it went off like that because someone got to the top
I went to a Maragaritaville restaurant in the Great mall of America...it was not very good
This is what life is about, damn...
Alternate title: 58 minutes of Eddy unknowingly getting inducted into the Jimmy Buffett cult
why
Now do al the bubba gumps
you just gonna slip a picture of Jim Croce in there like i wouldnt notice
Isn't there a Margaritaville cruise...!?
The audacity to start a Margaritaville video, not with Margaritaville, but Vivaldi is amazing
So surely the corporate people of margarita vile have to seen this, right!? Like surely they see this and are absolutely pissed about the terrible quality of food, pretty much, across the board right!?
Are there seriously none in Hawaii? Out of all the states I expected it there most.
Is hard rock next?
Do every buckies next
43:59 reminds me of Slurms MacKenzie
Jarvis?
My husband proposed to me on that ferris wheel, which is cool and all but it’s not as impressive as eddy burback taking a nap on it.
0:36 honestly I wanted to found out what margaritaville isv.
Still waiting for every hard rock cafe
Now do a fifty Subway’s in fifty states video!
I was disappointed in Ted's video that he didnt mention the hurricane in the myrtle Beach margaritaville. I went there as a kid and when the hurricane would spin and thunder, it scared brother. I still remember having a good time there.
the amount of time that went into both of your videos and the planning and editing and etc. deserves so much more than a comment and a like. fantastic job. jimmy would be proud. –I mean–he is proud. Jimmy is alive. And proud.
Im impressed Eddy and Ted, dont worry, thats more travelling than I'll ever do as a poor.
2nd YouTube video I've ever watched in its entirety that was longer than 5 minutes. The first one was the Rain Forest Cafe one.
Next up, Hard Rock Cafe!
First every rainforest cafe and now every Margaritaville. I think it's time to go to every McDonald's in us and Canada.
Next year every hard rock cafe
i once stayed at the margaritaville resort in orlando w my volleyball team for nationals (in those cottages)… it was a fever dream
The Rain Forest Café trauma was peak comedy!
cant wait for next year when you two do it with the hard rock café
Very excited for next year "visiting every great wolf lodge in the country"
Eddy eats at every McDonalds in the country when?
Your hellbent commitment to the bit and the absolute lack of enthusiasm and palpable despair while experiencing all of this are actually perfect
Eddy, I gotta say your mustache gives Tom Selleck a run for his money
whats the violin song in the outro and throughout the video
I’m not saying you should do this road trip again, but if you are to do this again, you should do a Bubba Gump restaurant trip
oh man the rainforest cafe bits were hilarious great callback
Another masterpiece. This video, much like the Rainforest Cafe, also made me feel physically ill in less than 5 minutes. Thank you
You know what you must do now eddy…complete the trilogy…with Hard Rock Cafe.
Wasting away again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again in Margaritaville
Maybe I need to try another Maragaritaville because I live near Syracuse and I went in theirs once, looked at the menu and politely left. It was awful.
Jimmy Buffett, the master of marketing. Margaritaville is gross. Sorry if I'm pissing on your parade, but it's gross. The food is trash, and the fact that the entire point of it's existence is to idolize a fucking one hit wonder is just weird. My wife and I visited the Margaritaville in New York, which probably added to the insane prices. Please, go anywhere else. Your local McDonald's is more interesting (and tastes better).
Sorry we didn't let you guys record on the coaster. Glad the mall could destroy your spirits with the Margaritaville / Rainforest combo. 🎉
Do bubba gump shrimp next!!!
TRULY INSPIRING.
The Looney Troon movement gets the most support from women. My source? The Facebook comments section in any debate group, the majority of the Troon defenders are women.   SO ...the only way the Troon movement will crumble is with gender critical people getting more women to join the counter movement of the Troons.    Heavy women support ended Prohibition. (Granted, they helped start it as well)    But....the GC movement will fail without more women getting on board.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
Next year: I ate at every bubba gump in the country (there's 22)
Margaritaville’s good but I prefer Coconut Pete’s Pinacoladaburg
I live in biloxi. It's a shithole. It's nice to see somebody else's perspective on the place though.
Something feels so wrong about your blurry feet. Like im looking at something inappropriate.   RIP Jimmy.
I went to the PCB Margaritaville once and my phone fell in between the booth and the wall. A kind server got me a spatula and tongs to try and get it out. I found 3 other phones before getting my own.
Do bubba gump shrimp next
Next stop... every hard rock cafe
What about the location in Santa Cruz CA?
I love how florida had the highest volume of margaritaville restaurants in relation to the margaritaville to US state ratio. I’m a proud Floridian! I’m also from Miami so seeing that cool guy on the highway is like a normal Tuesday here…
I wish I could like a video twice
now u gotta do the hard rock cafe to end the trilogy
16:24 I burped at the same time
Hard Rock Cafe next?
do bubba gumps next u won't
SO YOURE TELLING ME I COULD OF SEEN EDDY AT DESTINY USA????!!!!!
I'm glad you didn't get scammed by stopping in Sandusky Ohio at The Original Margaritaville 😂
You have not finished the journey. You need to complete every Margaritaville in North America by going to the ones in Mexico and the Caribbeans.
Why are the aliens so thicc???
I love how Eddy goes thru so much character arcs throughout the trip😭
Nice video, can’t wait for him to do every capital grille
What a cool shirt i wonder where he got it.
i have never seen you before but i want you to know i am in love with you and your energy.
<3
Complete the trilogy; do every Hard Rock Cafe.
i think next is bubba gump!!!
So as a person who lives 20 minutes from the Wisconsin Dells, I’m thinking I can skip Pigeon Forge…
Mr. Buffets Opus
Now you must visit ever Buc-eel’s 😅
Ever heard of the Hard Rock cafe?
Is next year Hard Rock Cafe? And then Jollibee for 2025?
For years I have said the only real replacement for Warren Buffett is Jimmy Buffett…this proves it.
next year, go to every mc donalds in the USA
wait did this trip predate the song someone made out of that church lady's speech
why wouldn't you just rent an suv if you wanted to cover your stuff?
I need to know more about the Florida man who was dancing on the road meridian.
1:02 - Yo, Eddy, he's been touring since the '70s. Dude, if you can't get the most basic stuff right, what ARE you doing?
that guy who you saw on both, BOTH of your roadtrips for random fucking themed restaurants deserved a free meal
Was that Nakey Jakey? Also, why you skip the Margaritaville casino in Bossier City, LA?
yes!! The THING!! and this was the upgraded thing.  The original thing was an out door museum w/ that same mummy.
i had a dream about margaritaville. Ive never been to, seen or even heard about margaritaville in my entire life up until this point, and i swear to god this awakened something in me.
But did you eat at the Margaritavill at sea???
What was in Spencer’s?
surely it's all Guinness worthy?🤔
Okay, but what about every Joe's Crab Shack across the country?
"oh shit! coolest mfs on the planet"💀💀
I wonder if Eddy did any research into cults for this video
Cool, now do bubba gump’s
I bet it's hard to eat with that sweet 'stache.
This is such an amazing tradition
There’s one in Columbus Ohio and in put in bay
20:19 the man cut me off in my thoughts.😂
Next year is chunky cheese
One simple trademarked word brought him so much success. It's uncapped capitalism at it's finest.
Question…why did y’all skip over the Shreveport, LA location and the New Orleans, LA location? Just wondering!
30:14  "Tastes like Cindy Lou Who."  ...you mean like an underage child who may or may not have been molested by a green-haired ape with myocarditis (which may or may not have been from all of those EUA COVID jabs...)...
I spotted a wild Nakey Jakey!
I recognized one of those road signs, but will never tell which one!
Hard Rock Cafe edition when?
Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. video when?
All i can see on your map is dozens of Samus' visor
Bruh when you showed the 9/11 "what if" exhibit i thought of Schlatt and THEN HE SHOWS UP THIRTY SECONDS LATER LMAOIO
Now do medieval times 😂
19:30 - 😂
Youtube did that thing where it unsubbed me from you. Just here to fix that. Keep being amazing Eddy.
Next Year: do “I ate at every Planet Hollywood in the Country”.
Sounds like an awful trip. Great stories tho.
never saw the Sandusky Margaritaville
Can you go to every buc-ees?
See ya next year with whatever niche chain restaurant you pick then!
22:44  Bro, if you're "a little hungover" then you aren't trying hard enough...  You either need to drink more (so you're A LOT hungover) or you aren't drinking enough to avoid the hangover by staying hammered at all times.  Either way, YOU'RE NOT DRINKING ENOUGH!!!
Somebody ring the Dinkster?
Everytime the volcano goes off there is a giant blender at the bar the fills up when all that smoke and stuff is going on lol 😂 (I love MV and always go to Universal Orlando lol)  Now that I saw your reaction for universal in Orlando I was Dying laughing (I’m a Passholder) and yes that is Jimmys real plane (it even has the bullet holes in it)
Next year: Bubba Gump Shrimp! Only 20ish locations!
He didn’t do the margaritaville at south padre island Texas
So... Bubba Gump next year then?
Ok, now go to every Outback in the US :)
19:00 Your name is "Deep Eddy"?  That sounds like too much of a flex for me to want to support you. I mean, if you're anything like me, then the "deep" part is somewhat misleading. I can go "deep" but if you're not touching the sides/perimeter, then she'll barely even notice that you hit the bottom...    ...with your dick...      Get it? #LongAndSkinnyDoesNotAlwaysWinTheRace
Ok now eat at every McDonald’s in the country
did you forget to go to the one at the lake of the Ozarks Missouri
Weird, I didn't see my local Margitaville in Syracuse, New York here! Eddy the FRAUD
Since it seems like you like to torture yourself with themed franchise restaurants. Maybe next year y'all should do a Hard rock Cafe run around the country.
There was a Margaritaville about a mile from my home in Southern Maryland. It shut down last year and there's a pub there now. It'll be cool if you visited this location, but it wasn't a very nice spot...I ate there once and was very disappointed.
Cracker Barrel Next Please. Leave an old timey photo in every location
Starting a Petition for Eddy to go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada next
I think this video negatively affected my mental health
The Planet Hollywood strip shots are reminiscent of Mega64's Sonic shots.
Come back to Canada for Hard Rock Cafe & Medieval Times!
Because they're the traveler Margaritaville deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So they'll journey on. Because they can handle it. They're not just any guest. They're a silent wanderer, a watchful diner. A Margaritaville knight.
All the Binkleys subscribed: :(
PARASITES
I bet you skipped the best one- the one in New Orleans! It was such a cool place. And now it's gone!!
ok now do Dave and Busters
Margaritaville is such a depressing song
Damn it’s so genius to build an audience big enough and dumb enough to watch something this pointless, enough that you can do it twice and know you’ll be paid for it. Respect.
46:32 watch out, he'll make you pay
My Boyfriend: "Babe, Eddy just dropped another mixtape, this one's every _Margaritaville_ in the country!"  Me: "But the Rainforest almost killed him. This is just way too many parrots, even for him."  *[Badum-tssh]*
gonna have to do bubba gump shrimp company next year.....
I see you fell victim to the call of "The Thing" just as I did. I never felt so duped in my life. 😂
Ted in “the thing” merch 😂😂😂
margaritville in shreveport louisiana
I’ve been wanting to do this but like, traveling to every museum in America hahaha
Did you guys accidentally skip the on e in Bossier City, LA?
🎼Wasting away again in Apocalyptaville.🎼
Wait, you didn't go to Margaritaville Lake of the Ozarks. Or is it just a resort and lacks a restaurant?
This guy hit his demographic and just made a mil in a week. Keep it up dude.
The traffic in Atlanta messing with your trip is peak comedy from someone who live here
All except: The Original Margaritaville (unaffiliated) in Sandusky, Ohio
BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP BUBBA GUMP
Thank you for blurring your toes Eddy
Schlatt just chilling in your video like some normal friend, wew.
is Ted on crack?
I love when Eddy get's those occasional war flashbacks to rainforest cafe
Eddy's just discovering the siren song of Jimmy Buffett early in life
That What if? Museum is awesome
I can't believe THIS is how I found out the margaritaville by me closed.
Next year you need to do all the Bubba Gumps!
That was beautiful. Now go to ever Hard Rock Cafe in the US, Canada, and Mexico
You should do all the Chuy’s restaurants or something next
EDDIE NEXT YEAR GO TO EVERY BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP
Eddy, you should go to every Applebee's in the country 😂
So, Bubba Gump Shrimp next year?
Aye living in cle, still had no idea we had one
jeep tj at 2:38 :D
Gross. And why?
All hail our overlord Jimmy buffet
Is "needed the room to get some work done" a euphemism for happy solo time?
Please do a Joe’s Crab Shack episode!!!!
Love these road trips!
As much as the Rainforest Cafe was a comfort place for you guys at the end, this video was comfort food for me. Two of my favorite pieces of content ive ever watched on the internet. Thank you for  your service, and may God have mercy on your tummy 🍹🍹🍹
Floridians know the rain is a big deal, don’t worry lol
them getting stuck is the most atlanta thing ever as somebody who lives here lmfao.
These videos are such a terrifying ride through the eye of late stage capitalism they thrill me in a way I can’t describe
I lose my group or kids in buc-ees everytime somehow
Me and my sister loved to play stinky feet at our local arcade, this is not a joke btw I've actually played it multiple times.
this is just the embodiment of "it's not about the destination it's about the journey"
As someone who knows ATL so well, the deadstop traffic wasn't surprising in the least. Glad you got some southern hospitality at the restaurant though. :D
PLEASE DO MEDIEVAL TIMES
Ted did 911 is what i took away from this journey
You know what sounds good right now....
Did you enjoy Tennessee?
Now make a case for bringing one to the northwest goddang
this is what the world needed
SoFi is the best High Heeled savings account I've ever heard of.
NO WAY YOU'RE DOING THIS AGAIN  Also, I hope you see the musical at some point in the trip
greetings from a guy who grew up in Wisconsin Dells!
can you do mcdonalds next
I worked at the Orlando location during college. This video encapsulates the Margaritaville experience.
medieval times
Eddy, are you alright? why do you put yourself through this?
49:51 beautiful
PLEASE GO BACK TO DOLLYWOOD BABY BOYS I NEED THE REVIEW!!!!!
Haha. The US seems like some sort of McDonald's country. I've been there 3-4 times and live in Europe. The differences are huge.
Nah fam, I used to worm at margaritaville in Hollywood, universal studios, to this day I fucking hate the music and food is meh. Fucking parrotheads. I cringe everything I hear his music in public. Help.
BUBBA GUMP
You didn’t go to the one in bossier city louisiana
I love that The Thing? t-shirt shows up at 36:50
Every texas road house next
Just waiting for the day I go to moa (which is local for me) and see eddy going to another restraurant for a video. Do hard rock cafe next.
as soon as i finished this video my mom told me that we might go to margaritaville and i audibly screamed
I can’t believe the McElroy brothers were not consulted for this video, absolutely insulting
My favorite fact about the Chicago Bean is that the artist who made it absolutely fucking hates that people call it that, but he's a douche, so it's fun to do it anyway.
"My second and FINAL road trip like this is done" Uh huh, sure buddy.
56:25   Hiiiiiii I was your server that night in LV  and I wish I had more time to chat with you guys, it was Sooooo busy!   I'm so glad you "finally felt it"!!!  You both had the coolest energy&  I had so many questions for you guys.   I truly appreciated your generosity as well!   And I was just thinking about that night the other day and my coworker just showed me this video!!!!   I'm glad you guys are well!   Again it was a pleasure meeting you, maybe you guys can come down again except just fly straight to Las Vegas and hopefully I can be your server again! ❤❤❤❤
Honestly, I'm shocked there wasn't any commentary on how weird the Tim Misny billboards in Cleveland are and it was just a quick silent clip. It's one of the funniest things happening around here as advertising right now. But maybe that's just because I have to see those on a daily basis and they don't get any LESS weird with time.
Why would you subject Ted to all of this? 😢
Next year, all McDonald's in USA and Canada
...sounds like visiting all of the Hard Rock Cafes in the US should be the plan for next year...
46:32 this billboard is of a lawyer named Tim Misny! he has so many billboards across northern Ohio he’s become a minor celebrity. And because everyone knows who he is the billboards have gotten progressively more unhinged.. which is why this one is just his eyes.
12:45 I KNEW IT WAS HIM. I went there for a road trip with my family and I got gummies and I saw him and I went "Oh, he looks like "Eddy Burback,the guy who visited every rainforest café in America" and I went on with my day but NO. THAT *WAS* EDDY BURBACK, THE GUY WHO VISITED EVERY RAINFOREST CAFÉ IN AMERICA
Chaos
Damn those aliens are thicc
Driving across the country has convinced me of one thing; abolish billboards
Never thought he'd do it again, 3peat maybe?
Atlanta traffic is the best.
The rainforest cafe stop 😭😂😂
Dude why am I just finding this channel
i believe again i do not believe final
Next year you can do every Landshark Bar & Grill!
Now go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country.
WTF I WAS JUST AT MARGARITAVILLE IN GRAND TURK
Whats next?
u gotta mix in a lot of greens and root veggies when u doing constant fried foods back to back
Time to do Hard Rock Cafe i guess
You should have seen the old The Thing! You got to see it after a multi million dollar renovation!
Every Denny's in America next...
My parents are Parrot Heads.... You should do the Jimmy Buffet cruise, to really round out your experience.
14:33 That's biloxi. Never ate at the margaritaville there.We usually go for Eat at Doe's a decent steak joint. I live currently in his home town. LUCKILY Pascagoula doesn't make a big deal about it, oh wait, they dedicated a beach to him. He hasn't been back to Pascagoula in ages. I live by the water so, I live in the rich section and it's nice. THOUGH literally a block and a corner from me is a trailer park. It's a weird town, but I love it more than living 10 minutes from Chicago's south side. Edit: Fun fact, MS is home to the LONGEST MAN MADE BEACH. Yeah, that beach in Biloxi, it's BS. They made it a long time ago. They still hold that world record. Some tycoon in Spain wants to make the LARGEST in AREA that I think might beat out our fake beach, but who knows.
your stress melting away? that’s the margaritaville lifestyle babey
Time for the 34, Hard Rock Cafes.
Alright next year time for all of the knockoff chuck-e-cheese places  I nominate space aliens located in Bismarck, ND
You passing all of “the thing?” signs in Arizona made me actually ugly snort out loud— I see those damn signs all the time driving from Tucson to Phoenix and it almost always makes me chuckle without fail. I gotta say though, I never actually knew what it was, so that part of the video was very informative for me.
The Mall of America Bladerunner M&M is the reference I never knew I needed
For the record The Cat in the Hat book gives me anxiety out the ass.. so they nailed that.
This was a journey
You went to the Dells when you were younger? I've been there for a furry convention a couple times and I can confirm that road you're talking about still feels like a Midwest version of the Strip. It's a neat little town and I plan on going back again
You ordered fish in Texas get the ribs dawg
The parrot head thing is so strange. I honestly find the whole Florida, Caribbean touristy beach culture very odd. It’s just so fake. It’s like a cartoon.
I HEARD YOU LIKE SUCCIN ON  THEM TOES!
Texas fan is stalking you. 😅
Biloxi is pronounced "Ba-lux-ee"
Forgot the margaritaville hotel and restaurant in Nashville
Hold up, J Schlatt cameo?
I think it's pretty clear that Ted is vamping your psychic energy dude. The weaker you get the stronger he becomes... Stake him! It's the only way.
I appreciate these videos but please don't feel like you have to do this. It seems like torture.
46:32 that’s Tim Misny. For those that don’t know, he MAKES THEM PAY
every church’s chicken in the country next year
So hard rock cafe next year?
I don't know why you did this, or why I watched it.
Went here whilst on Honeymoon in Universal. It was fine.
Bruh it’s so cool too see the difference in video style between you too I can watch the same journey twice and get a different experience each time
Half expected to see the margaritaville salt shaker drop when the song played ripp  Which is something i remember happening in the pcb location
“I jimmy’d a little to close to the sun” 😂😂😂😂
The tax write-offs alone from these meals must be amazing.
Next year: Medieval Times
lmao i've only watched this video and the rainforest cafe video of yours. Time to subscribe, I enjoy your content homie, keep up the good work!
It's only been out for 5 days, but this video has already paid for itself multiple times over. Big ups Eddy.
This is true culture
I remember going out after graduating BMT, and my drill sgt only gave us one piece of advice and that was TOO NOT EAT AT THE RAINFOREST CAFE.
At first, I was having a Mandela effect moment, but no, you are just insane.
You guys should go pilot protocol on the next one and dont order the same things so someone is still able to function
The sequel to RainForest Cafe we didn't ask for but we got
I had two Perfect Margaritas in the Margaritaville in the Panama City airport, and they got me waaaay more drunk than I wanted to be on a plane. Also, they took my water bottle when I went to sit by the gate. That was a hot, thirsty trip to Paradise
As a Mississippian, your and Ted’s pronunciation of Biloxi hurts my soul to the core.
my parents are Parrotheads it took a lot of convincing to keep them from laying down a ton of money on a Margaritaville Timeshare in Puerto Rico.
You skipped Jacksonville, FL. Video is invalid. Shave your dorky mustache
Iconic
I haven't watched a video in a while, so it's good to see that you're still committed to looking like a 'Guess Who?' character.
>I wandered around NYC drunk My dude must have faith in god
I've lived in allot of places and that PCB sunset is pretty hard to beat under the right conditions.
Go to every Texas Roadhouse next, or maybe (not a restaurant) buc-ees
vivaldi's winter in the beginning was unexpected but man did it feel good
30 minutes in before I realized Eddy wasn't saying 'City Wok.'
Really didn’t expect a Tim Misny cameo at 46:31. For those of you out of the loop, he’s a Northern Ohio defense attorney who’s commercials and billboards have become so iconic people recognize them from just his face. Great video Eddy and remember Misny makes them pay!
So is the Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory next year's trip?
the thing....that was amazing lol
I love seeing the different sides of the story by watching both ted and eddys videos.
holy shit pier park
Medieval times
You gotta do Johnny Rockets. I wanna see you go crazy to the forced employee dancing.
Eddy shouldve gone on the margaritaville at sea
I feel like I just watched a video of your mind slowly breaking.
So on brand that you got stuck in traffic on the way to the Atlanta location, I live here and can say that traffic is one of ATL's specialties.
hard rock cafe tour when
eddy did you have to call your bank before you did this to warn them about a million Margaritaville charges in different cities?
Sorry to say this but Puerto Rico is a US territory, and in the airport there is an Air-Margaritaville. Idk if that counts tho 😭
Cheeseburger In Paradise can't hold a candle to a BurgerBack Burger.
JARVIS 😊
hearing eddy say "last year" when talking about the rainforest video gave me whiplash..... it feels like so so long ago 😪
Go to every McDonald's next
Do Red Robin’s next
The only thing left to do is to step it up and go to every Hard Rock Cafe!
This is top quality millenial content thanks guys
This is a great video 🫡🙌
Great
Do Bubba Gumps!
no way the madman did it again lolol legendary
43:43 Hell yeah. A cameo!
Im sad that the CT location closed so you didn’t get to visit but im happy it was one less stop
Did it bother anyone else that the statue of liberty looked more like it was holding a martini glass than a margarita glass? Also how tf did Canada do Margaritaville better than WE do?! For shame America.
52:50 "you look lonely" "i can fix that"
46:32 As soon as I saw the Misny billboard I knew exactly where you guys were
There’s one going up in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. You have to start over soon.
36:10 LETS GO NASHVILLE
It's buh-luh-cee eddy
it's already been a year? where did the time go
Now do Hard Rock
Now do Medieval Times!
This is a masterpiece!!
Imagine taking a shot everytime he said margarita 💀
Jimmy is love ... Jimmy is life. Fins Up
22$ for jambalaya is not fine, not fine at all
I live in Cleveland and had no idea there was a margaritaville here.
For some reason this was in my recommended but im glad it was lol. Somehow you made this enjoyable to watch. You earned a subscriber forsure 😂
I'm watching this while recovering from heat exhaustion/heat stroke, and I think I'm going to throw up.
My older brother was able to move into a house before it was condemned bc his friends mom as a realtor… and the house still had a lot of the previous owners belongings in it still, 90% of this being jimmy buffet merchandise.
Next episode every hard rock cafe
Bubba gump next?
Ngl this would be the perfect kind of road trip for me because I am the opposite of the kind of person who would get sick of it.
Now visit the highest crime rate city/town of evey state in the U.S and stay in the worst rated hotel in each of the worst towns and document the hotel experience at 3am for every hotel you stay at.😂💀
what about the one in Santa Cruz??????
J.A.R.V.I.S. show me this guy's toes
Videos like this are really important for humanity
if you want a much shorter trip you could do paula deen’s family kitchen- i think there’s only like 6 of them?
Medieval times next trip?
Now eat at every McDonald's
did you not go to the Margaritaville Resort in Bossier City?
I’m so sad Eddy didn’t visit Lucy the Elephant when he was in Atlantic City. It’s the oldest surviving American Roadside attraction! It’s a 6 story tall Elephant that was built to be a house! It overlooks the ocean so it’s probably Jimmy Buffet approved!
i just find it endlessly funny that Canada is the highlight of these trips in terms of the quality of these gaudy theme restaurants.
Cant wait for the next trip
You guys should make honorable stops like T-Rex at Disney springs during the rainforest cafe trip or Lulu's in Destin during this one.
Next, obviously is medieval times
I heard the way you pronounced Biloxi and I cringed. My spouse is from Mississippi and it's "Bil-uh-xi"
Come to UK and do every weatherspoons
Lol I love this so so much thank you for making this video! 😂 I went to Margaritaville for my birthday last year and the drinks are so weak!! I hope your tummy feels better Eddy!
You must have Pepto Bismol on you at all times for this kind of adventure!
Happy to see the Syracuse location or as my friends refer to it, “The Saddest Place on Earth”
stop filming your toes its making me sick
Dollywood sucks ass. Went in September and it was $25 to park a mile away from the theme park. Each ride was a 2 hr wait. You couldn’t even walk five feet without running into someone.
not again... NO DONT DO IT NOOOOOOOOO
Next video: Eating at every Bubba Gump in the United States. 22 locations.
Hard Rock Cafe next
Next challenge. 3 years of going to every McDonald's in the world
Hard Rock Cafe is next buddy
What about the one in Myrtle Beach?
Alright, now do Applebees
Let's do the eat at every Wafflehouse challenge next. You'll never get tired of those hash brows!
Leave it to Atlanta traffic to ruin a trip lol
Waiting for all Bubba Gump's restaurants.
Why did you skip Nashville?
What about the margaritaville cruise?  Btw I loved this video so much thank you
Your girlfriend's hot
So what's the 3rd chain restaurant for next year?
17:09 Me taking a drunk piss at 3AM
As a parrot head I'm proud to see you living by his lyrics of "If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane" ~Jimmy Buffett
For three years been driving from SoCal to RGV and always pass by The Thing and now my curiosity  is laid to rest... How long did you took from Phoenix to San Antonio?
Forgot about the margarita vile in lake of the Ozarks in Missouri
I need to put down the nintendo because I saw the margarita markers on the map and saw Samus helmets.
Next should be the Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville cruise please!!!!!
good vibes.
Sad you didn’t get to check out Dollywood! It’s really fun and a key part of my childhood. I’m from right on the Kentucky-Tennessee border but my dad had annual business trips in Pigeon Forge while went to either The Island or Dollywood
Can you eat 30 pancakes?
Do this with Applebee’s, coward
buc-ees beaver nuggets are SOOOO good, i hope you got some on your trip!!!
Every Bubba Gumps in the world!?
Eddy looks at Ted at #20: “I hate you….”
ive never been in a rainforest cafe, but i could feel its bone chilling power through my screen
Why am i not surprised Cananda has the best one
I've been to the one at Myrtle Beach, good stuff
Now do all hard rock cafes
Hard Rock next?
Idea: Eat at every Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
We need the trilogy, Eddy
Now do it with McDonalds
😂
Hard rock’s next?
I didn't want this video to end
ermmm actually the line is "what would jimmy buffet do" fake fan
You didn't go to the one in Osage Beach, Missouri. This video is a lie
Hard Rock Cafe video when
YT bookmark of 38:12 in case YT forgets my spot
Lol this is amazing. I’m from SoCal…but my mom is from Minneapolis, so the mall of America segment killed me. The  menacing green m&m 😂😂😂 But really, the whole video was wonderful comedy. Thanks for the laugh therapy!!
There is a Margaritaville resort and casino in Shreveport, La
It’s so wild seeing all the places you’ve been to that I have as well. Especially the lesser known ones lol
Please do Hard Rock Cafe next!!!
What about the margaritaville in Sandusky OH
47:52 I have NEVER seen Danny look that genuinely sad before gglfjdhsggbkc
I kept wondering when in the video you were going to go to the one in lake of the ozarks, then I realized that it is just a margaritaville resort, there is no margaritaville restaurant there.
Your a legend bro the commitment is inane and your story telling is top notch!
I found out the one in my hometown closed through you and Ted ;-;
You sound like John Mulvaneys
did he not go to the one in Jacksonville FL?
You need to revisit the Atlanta location for the actual food and see the differences in their menu.
One must imagine Eddy Burback happy
Eddy you need to do Hard Rock Cafe next, pretty please ❤❤
Eddy... Honey... I'm pretty sure you're a masochist.
If only you had read his biography while doing the trip. I recall it being a reasonably good read.
Ugh.  We ate at the one in Orlando's CityWalk and it was so awful.  Weak drinks and disgusting, stone cold food.  Plus they sat us literally on top of the house band's subwoofer.  Never again.
42:34 The Statue of Liberty has a booth under it, of which I have sat in! So glad to have been in the same room as you even though it was months before!
3.5 million views in four days crazy
hard rock cafe next, i demand.
Should've visited the Senatorial Memorial Bathroom in the Minneapolis Airport while in Minnesota. Best place to solve your stomach troubles
I think you guys need to do Bubba Gump shrimp next year. Just think about it 👀
any time i hear jimmy buffet all i think is him singing "AIDS burger in paradise, AIDS burger and it ain't nice"
What about the ones at the airports??
dude you skipped the Margaritaville in Lake of the Pzarks, MO
Jesus Christ, why?!
14:04 Eddy, I’m sorry, but you are built like a Mii in this part.
Need a "9/11 - What if Ted did it?" shirt with that image of him in front of the pic when you asked the question.
HARD ROCK❤❤❤❤
Medieval times?
I know that it doesn’t technically have a Margaritaville restaurant in it, but I’m so sad you didn’t visit the Margaritaville Resort at Lake of the Ozarks 🥺
Eddy... Why are you renting a pickup truck for a road trip? Fuel efficiency, babe!
Real two nickel situation here
Bubba Gumps next!!!
omg so much fun seeing eddy on the atlantic city beach where i've been a million times in my life. he didn't comment at all on the AC rainforest cafe besides saying it was fine so it's nice to see my home city get a little love in this vid!!!
i think they missed one ngl
Jimmy Buffet himself should be the final boss for this road trip
I love these !
I don't want to be "That Guy", but i guess i'm about to.... Biloxi (Bi-Luk-See).
I wonder what theme restaurant you're going to visit every location of next year
Next you need to do Planet Hollywood
love you eddy 🎀
You did not ride on the Margaritaville Cruise Ship?
I can’t believe I missed eddy in my own Home town he’s lucky it wasn’t raining in pcb while he was there
Hate see that rental car bill.
There are 23 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co locations in North America.... .....just saying.
I think you skipped the Sandusky, OH Margaritaville. I couldn’t find it in the video.
“But even The Bean couldn’t keep my tummy from hurting” made me absolutely cackle
No way Tim Misny and his Cleveland billboards made the video😂. They went to Disney World and Misneyland in one road trip
I lived close to Atlanta, and I really didn't like it. However, that story about the manager letting them in when they closed the kitchen is the type of thing Atlanta does and something I do miss of the south!
This video is not helping my vivaldi addiction
I KNEW I saw you in the Bellagio a couple weeks ago! Now it all makes sense.
When the President of the United States was saying: *" ....y'know, the Thing"* THAT'S WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. 🤯
Not to be *that* person but there’s also a Margaritaville resort in Conroe,TX on Lake Conroe y’all missed 😬
I was like every Margaritaville in the country wow he must have eaten at the one at Lake Lanier Georgia near me and then was disappointed.
I grew up near Gulf Shores, AL and could've sworn I grew up going to Margaritaville a LOT. Turns out Jimmy Buffett's sister owns a sister chain to Margaritaville called Lulu's. A bit disappointed I didn't see the location I remember from my childhood, but the same vibe was still prevalent in these Margaritavilles. The Lulu's had one of the larger arcades around, so I was always happy to go.
The most important one was missed.... The Margaritaville Cruise Ship in Palm Beach, FL..... going to have to call this a DISQUALIFICATION
You were the asshole in Florida going 40 in the fast lane with your flashers on. Come on mah boiiii. Do better
31:57 Outstanding video but you didn’t go to the Margaritaville resort in Jacksonville Beach, FL. Kinda bummed me out seeing as I’m from there and it’s right on the beach
Now I have to go listen to the song cause I’ve never heard it
Ted and Eddy’s videos on this are so different from eachother that you HAVE to watch both
This better be an annual tradition now
30:53 I was on this ride and it broke down and I was trapped with the lights off and thing 1 and 2 running around and laughing on repeat shit was terrifying
every time he said "biloxi" I had to pause the video and chuckle before continuing.
I'm unsure why he didn't order a salad or something less greasy? His stomach was hurting the whole time
Next up: Hard Rock Cafe
I got stuck on the cat in the hat ride with an old friend and his little brother at the scariest part of the ride and the kid started screaming and crying. We got stuck right at the entrance of the dark room shown at 30:50, and everything was dark except for thing 1/2’s face. It was only one of them, so all that could be seen was this horrific doll face hanging down from the piano stairs. That ride is an acid trip from start to finish.
the tim misny sign in cleveland is the truest CLE thing i’ve ever seen
That has to be some of the most pathetic food I’ve ever seen. 10/10 would go
Jimmy Buffet is a terrible artist plus he has crappy resorts and restaurants..yet this was still entertaining. Also im from Dallas and have been to that Margaritaville in San Antonio and it was terrible as ever
3:40 and 15:45 - you recycled the cult joke, Eddy! YOU USED THE SAME JOKE, EDDY
you really were pulling off that hat
Is this just an hour of pedantic nonsense
The way y’all say Biloxi is driving me crazy lmaoo
Next year every McDonald's?
Eddy is the chosen one. When the planet fails I vote we send this video into space as a record of our noble civilization.
Yeah i see a Bubba Gump tour in your future.
I can't wait for the next road trip where you and Ted go to every single Burger King in North America
If you like pina coladas! And getting lost in the rain!! 🎶 ❤
really enjoy these! you definitely missed one Margaritaville though. Bossier City, Louisiana, it's a casino resort.
FUCK I forgot there's one at Pier park XD I worked at the movie theater and the pizza place there many years ago! I miss the sunsets and my family, but like NOTHING else . That place sucks to live.
Nothing - nothing could have prepared me for the alien dinosaur museum
couldn't stop at rainforest cafe, next I bet were going to see something like "eating at every Johney rockets."
IM FROM MYRTLE BEACH STAY SAFE LOL
Growing up in the 70ies and 80ies, i totally hate all kind of mustaches. Only total douchebags and proles wore them back than...Why are they returning ? Sorry, can't watch this channel anymore...Too much Ned-Flanders-Vibes here
Eddy eats at every Mcdonalds in the country
watching this is so funny as someone who’s grandparents are retired in orlando and actually moving to the new margaritaville neighborhood in daytona 😂 big jimmy buffet stans in this family
I think theres a margaritaville in Capitola, CA if i remember correctly, but i might be mistaken or it might have closed
If you didn't hit the jwb restaurants you f'd up
The "what if ted did 9/11" bit happened right when my red screen tint turned off, perfect timing, happened right when eddy pointed at him 😂
I stumbled upon Ted's videos and I just adore the dad vibes Eddy gives! The duo give major father and son vibes, which only was solidified when seeing Eddy's take on being at Bucees and I'm so here for it😂!
My mom and I travelled to the US this January (we are from South Africa hi 🇿🇦!) and went on a Royal Caribbean cruise from the port of Miami.  One of the stops was Mexico.  Literally as you step off the ship into the Mexican port, you step into a Margheritaville 💀💀 I didn’t know it was a massive chain but defs knew something was off that we were being encouraged/prompted to have our first ‘ real Mexican margherita’ at what was clearly a heavily American restaurant.  Defs was such an ick feeling and don’t worry, we did *not* stay there for our authentic margarita experience lol
Now do every hard rock
this should be a yearly tradition, next year you go to every mcdonalds
Imagine going to the same Margaritaville 21 times over 21 days.
only you could do this Eddy. The rest of us are not as strong.
Fucking awesome guys. Man, I love novelty restaurants haha. Do Planet Hollywood next!
12:28  you look like that famous painting of.  ww2 soldier suffering from ptsd
Is Fry's bankrupt? Because that would be a fun road trip
Now eat at every mcdonalds
Now go to every Tim Hortons in Canada
You could not have said “Biloxi” any worse lol
you didn't go to Tulsa.... Place sucks anyways
I have no idea why but this and the rainforest cafe video have this weird combination that seems to encapsulate the American road-trip like if I wasn’t American and wanted to know about American culture for some reason these videos sum some unspoken things about america up
Next year you could do hard rock or Bubba Gumps 😂
"That's when for the first time, the thought crossed my mind.  I might kill Ted." Damn, that got me
Bubba Gump When
I will die happy for planet Hollywood version if this amen 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Guys, yall gotta do the hard rock cafe's next year. Besides Planet Hollywood. I cant think of a better trip for next year
u know you love nashville too much when you get excited when the batman building and ryman were in the back ground 37:00
They missed the Margaritaville in Conroe, Texas.
ITS BEEN A YEAR?!
I get so excited when you get to a margarita like I’ve been to lmao
Omg....ive never ever seen chicken that dry before
I like to imagine one of the locations is confused and just has Warren Buffet everywhere.
i think the fact that this video is nearly TWICE as long as the rainforest cafe video speaks for itself
In the few years I lived Syracuse, several people were stabbed at the Margaritaville in Destiny USA.  And if you jammin jambalaya is streaming like that, they microwaved it before serving it to you.
Wait a minute. We have a Margaritaville in N LA and you didn't come here?
This guy could do a fire Mario cosplay
11:14 how the fuck can a portion of fish and chips be 1560-1739 calories, jesus fuckin christ
As someone who has been to many Jimmy Buffett concerts (far too many thanks to being brought to them by my parents when I was too young to remember) I can confirm, it is just a giant cult
My favorite part of this whole video, is that one giy that walked by and said "OOH SHIT, COOLESR MOTHERFUCKERS ON THE PLANET"
Love how Eddy is a standard human enjoying beaches and shit while Ted is the back alley dude enjoying the fumes of gasoline and eating a dumpster pizza.
Give him 22 margaritas he's gonna try and live like Jimmy Buffet
can’t wait till you come to the uk and visit all 826 wetherspoons ❤️
I love how Teds videos frame these trips as character dramas detailing the slow deterioration of a friendship and yours frame them as psychological horror’s detailing the slow deterioration of your sanity. Both with the opposite vibes as before. Truly fascinating.
Margaritaville is one of God’s greatest gifts to mandkind and yoir lack of appreciate of this gift is sacrilege!
You need a life.
Watching the section about the Cat in the Hat ride brought me back to when my family went as a kid and I can agree with 100% certainty that I was traumatized by this ride.
One time I had too many edibles then went to the Margaritaville on the Vegas strip and let's just say, I had a terrible time.
did he not go to the one in bossier city, louisiana or did i just miss it in the vid
As a Brit, it hurt to see fish and chips done so badly
At 42:26 the guy at the counter drops his pen 😂
52:11
I’m British and I’ve literally never heard of this man 🤣 I had to google him, The fact he’s worth like a billion dollars is insane, good for him 🤣
Looked like a gay ol time
Was anyone else expecting Josh to show up in the Times Square Segment?
"I do take bribes" Thats a like
Now fire the islands
Can't wait to see the video next year when you guys go to all Bubba Gump locations
I went to the one in vegas this last weekend and the jambalaya was actually really good there, that employee in NY was capping
I would love to see Bubba Gump as part 3 😂
Live the dissociation king 👏
The ladies call him Eddy "Deep Eddy" Burback. Or at least that's just the name I gave him in my erotic fan fictions.
"Nibblin' on sponge cake" <crying intensifies>
Bubba Gump Shrimp next? :)
Kind of ironic how the Canadian joints from both restaurant chains provided the best food of them all
When will Eddy finally Daddy a Pixar movie🤨🤔
I want this restaurant but to be all about yeat no dick riding 😂
WE DEMAND MORR VIDEOS FOR LESS!
lmao biLOXi
The Thing museum used to claim the Winston Churchill car 'might have' belonged to Adolf Hitler.
House of blues is next
The United States really is a interesting place lol. Such a land we've built for ourselves.
I already can’t wait for next summer!!!
I want to get carpet burn on my lip from kissing you
The gospel music during the carnival ride….   💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Next should be bubba gump
What’s next… Hard Rock Cafe?
truly captivating
I work across the street from Nashville's Margaritaville, and I've never been there.. Looks like shit lmao
Waiting for a part 3 now lol
You should take activated charcoal capsules with you…really helps with food poisoning
do Chili's
I think small rental pick-up whenever someone says Road Trip. Of all the poor choices in this vid that was the most avoidable other than just not doing it in the first place.
The Margaritaville icon on your map is Samus.
it was so awesome seeing my town (panama city beach) in this video! hope you guys had fun!
Love your humor. Continue to suffer for us man. ❤
His mom Elizabeth and his dad, Warren... Lmao.
Weird to watch this and wait for a couple Margaritavilles that it turned out Eddy never went to, then look up the locations afterwards to find out they're both closed. Vegas's is still the same, though! Pour a margarita out on the curb for the fallen locations, I guess.
Currently at 11:16 and I gotta say, the courage to even consider seafood after the first night of sickness... Impressive
My liver burned in sympathy from watching you drink all those margaritas. Your blood must be at least 20-proof by now.
The way you were pronouncing, the city Biloxi is killing me.
every bubba gumps next!!!
You should go to every McDonald's in the U.S. and Canada
it's bih-lUHxy
Aight now let’s see y’all hit every Hard Rock Cafe
Wait, Margaritaville is a Restaurant?
We live like less than an hour away from the one in Biloxi and it’s the best arcade around us! We’ve been there a lot within the last couple of years but I’ve never even had their food.
Didn't another guy do this?
You drove right by one in Pensacola beach! Right between Destin and Panama City
Misny jumpscare at 46:30 😂
Living in Biloxi and not knowing Eddy was here.....distraught.
Go to every McDonald’s In the world
53:00 I literally almost spit on my laptop-- Eddy this may be one of the most well-edited, well-scripted, and hilarious videos you've ever released. Keep up the good work, dude.
As a Chicago suburban myself, you guys are clearly wrong to think that The Bean is the best part of Chicago.  It’s a universally accepted fact that the faces that spit out water is the best place to be when you’re in Chicago.
I have not heard anyone say tummy like that since I was five years old. I’m not trying to be rude. I’m just trying to pointed out.
Now your forgetting the margaritaville cruise line
Next year you should do every Hard Rock Cafe, now that would be a challenge
On the next viseo Eddy is going to every Starbucks. Yes it will take him 5 life times but he is one dedicated son of a gun.
Gotta do the Hard Rock Cafe next year
Mr money bags and company are in every casino in Oklahoma.
Ok, next year! Every US & Japan based Bubba Gump Shrimp Company! (I dare you to take me with you!)
Next Challenge:  Go to Every Single Hard Rock Cafe in America (& Canada possibly)
I've been to the one in Panama City Beach. I was sitting at the bar when a hurricane hit and the place started to flood. The locals there are so cool that nobody even said anything about leaving until it got to the back of the building. I don't know if it was the manager's office, the kitchen, or some other room that's important, but when that started to flood they evacuated and closed the restaurant for the rest of the day
Why would you rent a Tacoma and not like… a Corolla, or a Camry?
Bubba. Gump. Shrimp. Episode.
Wait Jarvis was there too?
Holy Sh*t Jimmy Buffet got allot of mileage from that song! God bless him!
I cannot believe y’all went on the rock bottom plunge directly after having margaritaville. That’s just a recipe for disaster
he says "never listen to anyone named binkley" then says "met up with our friend Schlatt" right after.
Next time every single Hard Rock Cafe
The Journey Continues.
10:55 i did not expect to see someone wearing a jersey for my school in this video, and yet here we are
The McElroys could never
Ok now do every subway
Love the journey, but I can't believe you skipped over the incredible "light-show" that takes place every hour on the hour at the Times Square Margaritaville!
Eat at every McDonald’s in the country or all the fancy ones
my boyfriend and I have joked (and then realized we might not be joking) about having our next Valentine’s Day at the Ozark Margaritaville, completely land locked just feels right for a beach themed resort.
Idk why you keep doing these and ive never considered ever going to margharitaville (still dont) but i like it great vid
Now is a good time to point out that there are 27 Bubba Gumps in North America
46:32 ahh yes I always love to see how people react to those billboards 😂
imagine meeting eddy out and about and have to explain to your friends you know him cause hes ate at every rainforest cafe and margaritaville
As a former employee of the Canadian location, absolutely loved this! Didn’t mention the constant playing of the song, you quickly hate it but slowly drives you insane till you love it.
Margaritaville is one of those places I thought was SO cool when I was 22. Now that I’m 32 I go back and the food is so shitty, there’s no alcohol in the cocktails, and I too have the dreaded tummy ache.
ed gets that 1000 yard stare when he sees the rainforest cafe
There is something cathartic about chanting BOAT with the boys.
Alternative video title: I attempted alcoholism for a month
He missed one. There’s one in the Lake of The Ozark’s in Missouri.
Did you learn nothing from your previous sins
DO HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT.  ….I actually went to a Hard Rock Cafe in England and all the staff were purposely speaking with American accents and it tripped us out. It tripped them out further when they realized we were actually American as well lol.
The whole Mall of America section had me fucking dying, lol
Every single Hard Rock Cafe in the world. Do it you coward.
You know this video is a hell of a lot more enjoyable when you cut out the bits where he hallucinates being funny, which is like, 20 minutes worth of content? Still an enjoyable video just saying though, focus more on the genuinely good moments with people and not the bizzare “oh no the spirit of capitalism is taking over.” Kind of stuff.
The duality of Atlanta, stupid traffic and nice people.
Oh you are not done. There are 22     Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. calling your name in 2024…
Please do Dicks Last Resort next summer
Missed the lake of the ozarks one but I guess it doesn’t matter
You Completley skipped the margaritaville in jacksonville
23:31, bro timetraveled!!
I am new and enjoy your videos
Time for every Hard Rock Cafe
This was way more entertaining to watch than I thought it would be. 😆You got a new sub.
I have that flower polo from Target too Ted, goes hard
Will Dick's Last Resort be next?
GREAT VIDEO! it would be cool for u to tweet/post what location you are at so ur fans can meet u at the restaurant. much love
Went to buccees last night. It's a Texas holyland.
i can't believe he said "it's Margaritaville time" in a rainforest cafe
Eddy's like the supersize me guy for gen z
Is anyone else amazed this guy is straight? I sense someone in the closet 😀
Dude I live in El Paso I’ve seen that sign there since I was like 10 and I’m 21 now, I’ve always been so fucking curious about that the fuck it was LOL
My sister got married on that beach in key west🫡
Hard Rock Cafe is next! Like to show how much we NEED it!
best god damn mustache I've ever seen
No joke my family went on a trip to Tennessee and the same day he posted this I saw the sign for the Margaritaville there near Dollywood 💀
Eddy, what about the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks?
Hard Rock Cafe next year! 34 Locations.
Your pronunciation of Biloxi killed me!  The "o" sounds more like a "u" - Bull-uck-see.  :p
i love how eddy progressively becomes more and more indoctrinated into the jimmy cult
Eddy, is jimmy in the comments section now?
I didn’t even know there’s a The Thing museum in Arizona. I need to go there 😂
I ate at the Pigeon Forge Margaritaville while I was there for CoasterCon at Dollywood. Can confirm the town was a fuckin fever dream.
Every Hard Rock Cafe
So all 22 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co's when?
I clicked on this video knowing the one I’m closet to (in San Antonio) is one of the worst.  Edit: if you come through Texas you ABSOLUTELY MUST get a Buckee’s T-shirt. They are the best.
Missed one in shreveport
They should go to all the Bubba Gump Shrimp Cos next year. Including all the ones in Japan.
You need to go to every buc-ee's
The green m&m at the mall of America was your blade runner 2049 moment
Eddy sponsored by my student loans. Cool.
Can you eat at every Bubba Gump in the Country?
Hard Rock Cafe?
I love how they brought up 9/11 and then immediately met up with Schlatt
The night that Ted booked his own hotel room was definitely so he could jerk off
Next one has to be Bubba gumps
I didn’t even know that Margaritaville was made by jimmy buffet we just went there for birthdays… the more you know.
Next video idea. Eating at every McDonalds in the world
This video had me rolling. I don't even know why I found it so funny, but the pixelated toes and the loss of sanity mid way through was very funny. The rain forest cafe spottings were also funny.
Hope you enjoyed your time on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. It’s Biloxi (buh-lux-ee) by the way
😂😂 52:59
Hot damn it he did it again!
52:49 was this a Blade Runner reference or am I tripping?
Can't wait till you guys do Bubba Gumps next (34 locations)
You completely missed out! Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg are amazing places that you can easily spend a week and never get close to seeing everything they’ve to offer! Gatlinburg is also connected to the the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and if you drive threw the park on the other side of the Mountain is Cherokee NC which is the Eastern Cherokee Nation and a place I call home! We have plenty to offer in Cherokee too such as our huge, world class Casino and many cultural attractions that you can learn about Cherokee culture and our history.
fucking great vid
Why am I watching this?
What about all of the Medieval Times restaurants; that would be fun... for us
Bubba Gump shrimp next please!
I have literally been to almost half of these, lol
fantastic content
You should do Bubba Gumps next!
petition for next year to be rock hard cafe
😂 I think he missed one that is like 20 mins from the Pidgeon Forge location. If I'm not mistaken, there is a second Margaritaville in Gatlinburg, TN.
This was so funny. Rip your stomach. Also, Biloxi is pronounced as Bill-Luxee. :)
Hard Rock Cafe when?
Next up, Bubba Gumps.
but why would you rent a truck...
Now for our next trip: Hard Rock Cafe
Ah you hilarious, ironic hipster. You got em again.
There is also a Margaritaville subdivision in SC
Bill-lux-ee
Starts the trip as a silly joke, ends the trip as a homicidal alcoholic.
Can somebody tell me what time in yhe video he gets to Cleveland if at all lol
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO DO THIS AGAIN
vivaldi's winter was the real star of this video
You need to go to every cheesecake factory next year. Never run out of food options that way
*stop tryin to act like ur cooler than Margaritaville, ur just a corny hipster*
the name of the sponsor seems kinda familiar i wonder what it reminds me of...
Next up McDonald’s
complete opposite of Teds vid lmfao
This is genuinely inspiring.
Pls go to every Medieval Times in the country
I hope he does every Medieval Times in the country next!
Don't give this hack any more attention than he already has! He stole the idea for Margaritaville from Coconut Pete's song Pina Coladaberg seven and a half years before his song came out. RIP Coconut Pete, I miss you more every day.
next year you should try to visit every great wolf lodge in the country and Canada
Just as the volcano turned green, I said "...and Jimmy Buffett starts playing a shitty ballad"...not knowing that was actually what happened.
Imagine if he did every Hard Rock Cafe
I bet you could do this with Bubba Gumps
I’m electrician and the Margaritaville in Nashville is so damn disgusting. There’s pools of grease on the floors throughout the kitchen and let me remind u this is in the morning so the kitchen should be clean cause there not even open. Can’t imagine what it looks like during the day. Ps there’s also rats all over the place.
Do every hard rock please
Fun fact about the Syracuse Margaritaville; they haven't paid their rent to Destiny in over a year. The mall has failed so far to wring it out of them.
There's a Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio
Please visit every Medieval Times! 🏰
I think his sister has one too, Lulu's
Ok but shout out to the manager
As a native Clevelander, I love how Cleveland gets less than 30 seconds and yet it doesn't skip a single noteworthy detail 😂 Tim Misny billboard? Check. 271 and/or I90? Check. Janky parking lot surrounded by construction in the Flats? Check. Inexplicably beginning to like something just because it's in Cleveland? Double check. My only minor complaint was that you didn't get to wiggle your toes in Lake Erie's needle infested sand.
As a Tennessee local I'm so glad you could come visit The Island and our very misplaced Margaritaville in the middle of the landlocked and non tropical smoky mountains! Its a shame you couldn't swing through Dollywood though, so come back soon and tell us what you thought!
I hate it when my tummy hurts
YALL SKIPPED THE ONE IN JACKSONVILLE
go to every mcdonalds next
"The day you had self-reflection is the day you had *diarrhea*?!" -Eddy Funniest part of the video. 😂
33:20 The guys at Neebs Gaming are based out of Wilmington and the recently passed Thick44 absolutely despised everything Jimmy Buffett. One time he was joking about eating at a Margaritaville and mockingly says, "Here comes another hurricane!!". That joke finally makes sense
I go to pigeon forge a TON!! I’ve stayed at the margaritaville there and in gatlinburg and it’s so cool to see someone else go to a place I visit frequently, absolutely love these videos!
do the hard rocks
I need a way to see uncensored Eddy Burback feet. I will pay what I can to see them, which is about $15
Isn't there 24 in the US and Canada?
48:23 The boys are about to drop the sickest alt-punk rock album of your life
Great video. In 2015 I was actually the construction administrator for the engineering firm that worked on the Hollywood Beach Resort. I have a lot of stories from my time on-site. One vivid memory was as we were preparing for the TCO, Jimmy actually walked the site and we got to meet him in person. He stood out like a sore thumb while on site by looking like he was some tourist that got off of a cruise ship.
hard rock cafe gotta be next year
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So Hardrock Cafés next???? There's 33 btw
When y’all going to every Hard Rock Cafe?
Eddy's villain arc
for the record seafood comes from where we dispose of our trASH AND SEWAGE. STOP EATING IT.
how can you smoke weed and have tummy aches
I know you guys said you wouldn't do another one of these... But what about Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 22 US locations...
Ive never heard of margaritaville but goodluck
They gonna do this again bet😂rip
Eddie missed out on the Margarita Ville that use to ve in Middleton,WI
Of course Canada was the best tasting food, slay
Margarita's are over rated just like margaritaville rain forest forever  Rip jimmy
"Our 2nd and final road trip doing something like this"  Okay, sure Eddy, I'm sure you both can resist the urge to visit every Hard Rock Cafe in the US.
I’m unsure if you know how iconic of a billboard you featured in your Cleveland stop. He makes them pay
Damn two popular themed restaurants in san antonio!! So glad that some youtubers are coming to san antonio
Every Bucc-ees road-trip when??
Please do medieval times dinner and tournament!!!! 10 locations, one in Canada and its the PERFECT trilogy completing themed restaurant
Dude looks like he eats burgers and drinks bud heavies every night, yet a few fried fish platters kill his gut.
Next part of this series is every great wolf lodge in the US.
MISNY
There used to be a  Jimmy Buffet’s Cheeseburger in Paradise- which was a different restaurant than Margaritaville- near where I live in Indiana. It closed a few years ago. I miss the dessert nachos.
Bruh you were in Conroe!?
RIP Pensacola beach margaritaville
My first comment when he said he was driving to ATL was well, there is like a 105% chance they will be stuck in traffic. Oh boy was I not wrong!
Who's the chick at 4:55? ASL?
My head-canon would like to believe that Eddy and Ted will next set their sights on eating at every McDonalds in the country (and Canada) and that in a few decades we'll have the most banger conclusion to this trilogy....
Do every Applebees pls
So next year Eddy goes to every Waffle House in the country?
I thought I was original for thinking hard rock cafe is the next one in this series but it seems that everyone is actually in agreement about that fact although hard rock has 165 locations worldwide so it wouldn't be complete commitment to just do the us and canada. much 2 consider
This video has been sponsered by drunk driving
It's funny the Bucces incident is the same thing that happened to me when my family went to Florida. I got lost and went to go to car when I just see my mom, dad, and older sister wearing a Bucces onesy
You deserve a treat next trip, eat at every bud-ees
Now do McDonald's...
Please go on the cruise and report back
If you were wondering the odds at 14:08 it’s 1 in 53 sextillion.
Omg my boy Tim Misny
How about going to every Planet Fitness in the country
Bubba Gump Shrimp tour when
I really hope these videos reach jimmy and he atleast acknowledge the determination and commitment
Man I watched this whole thing. This was so entertaining.
Just graduated from a college in Syracuse. Seeing you in Destiny mall was crazy… sad that you had to go there. But still cool? I guess
You know what’s crazy is that bucees you stopped at was in Bastrop. The amount of times I have seen that particular location of the beaver is so insane I knew it as soon as you walked inside
I just finished Halo Reach while watching this. Thanks for following me on the journey
Please go back to Pigeon Forge and enjoy Dollywood someday, it's probably my favorite theme park
I would've waited until the one in Boston was open before doing this
I've lived in cleveland my whole life and I genuinely didn't even know we had a margaritaville here. Recognized that tim mizny sign right away though.
You guys gonna do every Texas Roadhouse next?
They missed Shreveport
As someone who has lived in the metro Atlanta area for 26 years... I didnt even know wr had one of these here and now I gotta go in honor of yall lol
47:10 best random quote ever
"The day you had self reflection, is the day you had diarrhea?!"   Lol
Go to every McDonald's next
Sometimes you gots to put on a stupid shirt and just let go of all the misery in life I’m so glad I finally learned that
Hard rock Cafe next
You're actually mistaken concerning the Biloxi Margaritaville Casino. The Casino was highly profitable, but that was all that it was a casino. Buffet wanted to add a resort hotel to it, but they were leasing the land, and when the land owner said no and raised the rates on the land, Margaritaville said fine and shut down. Basically the land owner was purposely blocking the financing which had already been lined up for the expansion in hopes of squeezing more money out of the company. So they bought the land the resort sits on now, and there is still hope that they will one day add the Casino back where the arcade now is.  I've been to that Casino several times and it was always packed.
Eddy looking like a snac
54:00 those characters arent from margaritaville. those are from the Slot company VGT. i used to work in a casino and saw them all the time
Now you should go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the US and Canada.
You need to visit Dollywood. I'd love to see your coverage... maybe check out other things lings like the largest ball of yarn and other such places?
You guys should explore Pigeon Forge next summer! There's SO MUCH TO DO THERE
Would love to see them go to every single Hard Rock Cafe or every Medieval Times in the US.
Im glad in not the only one who isn’t a fan of Buccee’s! I don’t hate it, but I find it stupid how into it people are-
Poor man and too come to Tennessee twice
Next year's road trip should be all of the Bucees! Because you guys have yet to actually meet Bucky!
Those were some vigorous dance moves to be doin' on a traffic median, that was impressive!
going back to the rainforest cafe vid to try and spot the margaritavilles in the background like easter eggs
Sad thing about Panama City is that outside the beach front and strip its just as depressing and run down as the rest of Florida
Take a drink every time he says Margaritaville 😅
Between the grease and alcohol, thank your liver for its sacrifice.
HE SAW TIM MISNY HE SAW TIM MISNY
best in the game
I thought the thing was a mummified chimpanzee.
Eddy absolutely knew what he was going to find in Spencer's 😂
The editing on this is flawless.
3:08 I love the random dramatic music (also does anybody know the name of this song )
Bubba Gump’s is next right?
My friend and I dream of doing this but with Medieval Times.
23:34 I'd say his songs are BASED everywhere, not just in Key West, FL
mcdonalds next
Next video: I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the County
Good to hear our Margarita Ville is better than most lmao.
Imagine if that last shot with Planet Hollywood was an easter egg for next year!
Can’t believe that Ted nivison would steal this video idea just a hour later
Im pretty sure the boston one has been open for like a year
Hello from Phoenix! Hope you enjoyed your stay in our hellish heat wave :)
I can't help feeling Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. will end up on their travel list.
Bubba Gumps Next!!
Who is that stunning female specimen?
It's always fun watching Eddy go slowly insane, whether it's being traumatized by the Rainforest Cafe or joining the Cult of Jimmy Buffett.
PLEASE do all the Bubba Gumps next! 🙏
I thought Ted had already enjoyed himself "for the first time"?😕
Bubba Gump.
North Eastern Ohionans get proud with that Misney cameo
I'm even sic of Margaritaville after watching this. I'll never go.
Hate when youtubers like him go out of their way to look bad.
this video is my margaritaville
Isn't there a margaritaville is st Thomas and puerto rico?
I envy your mustache and your patience for bad food
Why not return the food that was less than edible?
Canada has higher food standards than the U.S. that's why the food tastes better.
now you gotta do every bubba gump shrimp. there are 22 in the us + two in mexico (and a few more worldwide but whatever). your move, burback
Eddy, why
And here I thought the rainforest  cafe video could not be topped
Hard Rock Cafe????!!!!!!!????!!!
Next trip is all the Hard Rock Cafes in the US
Road-trip to very Dick’s last resort and become more broken every time the staff is mean to you
can't wait for the cracker barrel episode to round out the trilogy
Watching someone eat this much food made me have to poop
46:31 a vital piece of Cleveland culture
>goes to chain restaurants  >is mad about chain restaurant food quality
Medieval Times next year?
In love with the tapestry man. I will empty my pockets
Hard rock cafe
I know you said this was your last one, BUT… consider a restaurant that has a location in Hawaii and/or Alaska 👀
My great aunt lives in Biloxi, Jimmy was born in Mississippi, thats why it feels like a cult as soon as you get there. The casinos are pretty nice though, almost like a Las Vegas of the south.
As someone who grew up near Niagara Falls (on the American side), I can say that the Canadian side is much nicer.  We rarely stayed on the American side when visiting.
i clicked this vid to ask, do u hate yourself? cuz this feels like some sort of insane masochism the world has never before seen
Next go to every chuck e cheese
You getting stuck in such bad traffic on the way to Atlanta that it almost ruined your whole trip is SUCH an Atlanta thing. That is the quintessential Atlanta experience. I'm glad the staff there were nice though!
Can't picture Jimmy Buffett sitting in on Board meetings. I think he's a bit of a sellout.
awesome
i hate to be the one to tell you this. but there is another margaritaville at the lake of the ozarks in missouri
Shoulda had Florida at the end, ending with the original Margaritaville
Next time you do this, please, Bubba Gumps!! Edit: Made this comment at the beginning of the video. Sad you don't want to do another one of these but you are the master of your own content. Rock on and make whatever you want!
Instead of blaming a woman, Jimmy knows that it was his own damn fault...
Planet Hollywood when?
They missed the original Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio
My vote is for every Medival Times next!!!
New drinking game: Take a shot every time you hear the word margarita
Y’all telling me you’re in my hometown and I didn’t even know 😭
So Eddy what restaurant is next?? Bennagians, Outback Steak House, Medieval Times?? what insanity inducing road trip will you and Ted go on next??
Next year Eddie goes to every Chuck E. Cheese's in the country  😂🤣
I ate at the one in Waikiki beach, horrible. Ate at the one in indianapolis, also horrible. Circa 2012.
So, when are you gonna hit up every Dick’s Last Resort?
I was just at the margaritaville in navy pier and and a seagull shitted on my volcano nachos, the waitress was really nice and got us more so overall 10/10.
please go to Casa Bonita next please
Now you guys gotta do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Yes
The fact that I could see my work as they crossed the Peace Bridge makes me so happy to be from Niagara Falls
I'm from Florida and the rain is a pain in the caboose. My deepest condolences that you had to deal with just... Florida in general.     Great Video though!
What about in Osage Beach MO?
Next year, You have to do Hard Rock Cafe 👀
This reminds me of mid to late 2010s YouTube minus the funny parts.
Yall just missed Margaritaville pensacola lmao
When is Hard Rock Cafe coming
Do Bubba Gump next
can we get a hard rock cafe trip?
I think the real margaritaville was the friends we made along the way
Misny will make them pay
Imagine doing this to the 321 Cheese cake factory restaurants throughout the United States and Canada.
All I can think of is Justin McElroy
patiently waiting for them to eat at every Bubba Gump restaurant
these guys are definitely stoned
711 world tour lets gooo
Can't wait for eating at every McDonald's in the United States
Looking forward to the trip to a weird restaurant chain next year, which will definitely be the last one, for sure
You guys gotta do Big Bass Pro Shop next!
Very cool Eddy! you should do McDonalds now.
not even the margarittaville on isla nublar?
I don't think americans realize how absolutely weird their country is
I didn't even realize this was a chain, the only one I've seen was in cozumel
You should go to every McDonald’s in America and Canada
whens hard rock cafe coming out?
please do this again it scratches my brain just right
I like how californian/new yorkers americans make fun of americans from central states the same way the rest of the world makes fun of americans in general (californians/new yorkers included)
well done on finishing your challenge. but personally, I don't think you're quite done with these trips. now all you have to do is every Wetherspoons in the UK, good luck lads, Godspeed.
Isn’t there one in Missouri or is that just a resort
I want Schlatt’s perspective too.
Eat at every McDonalds on earth
Next Year every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the US and Canada
jakey in the first 5 minutes? im in
He should do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next
"dont go into Spencer's" too late dude. Too late.
You and Ted should go to every Bubba Gump shrimp Co. in the country next.
Did he go to the one in San Jose??
Ok its official I wanna go to one of these!  My grandma, mom, and I would always go to Myrtle Beach South Carolina and hearing that just brought a tear to my eye.
It’s nice seeing Eddy. It be the depressed parent who’s just happy his kid is happy
A great finale to this series would be for both Ted and Eddy to go to all of the Dick’s Last Resort Restaurants in the US and Canada. They insult their customers - making for wonderful content. 😂
52:52 amazing blade runner reference
WHERE IS THE BOSSIER CITY MARGARITAVILLE, EDDIE? NORTHWEST LOUISIANA WON'T FORGET THIS
Dave and busters now
I'm changing the story back to VERMONT BOYS ALWAYS WIN
I can't wait until next year when Eddy Burback and Ted Nivison go to every location of my favorite movie spawned restaurant chain, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
*I didn't even know this exists*
You "lucked"  out  (or not) just saw an article that the company that owns the NYC Times Square Margaritaville declared bankruptcy and that its expensive to run in NYC
Ted falling into the Margaritaville chair absolutely sent me.
Albert Camus would write another Myth of Sisyphus on Eddy and Ted
missed one in shreveport lmao
That is not what jambalaya is supposed to look like
Did I miss Virginia (maybe it was Maryland) or did they shut it down?
When are you doing "I ate at every Hardrock Cafe in the country"?
Had you really never been in a Spencer’s? 😂
this is like the movie midsommar but in America instead of Sweden
Seriously, if I had the money and the time available I’d do a trip like that.
Was it the ahegao shirts at Spencer's again? Goddamn it 😂
May I suggest Medieval Times as your themed restaurant tour summer 2024?
Do all the Buc-ees next, please
Now go to every McDonald’s in the US
Every Hard Rock Cafe
So amazing 🎉
Live Laugh Jimmy!
I can’t wait for them to do Planet Hollywood next year
Me watching Rainforest Cafe video: There’s no way it can get better than this Eddy: posts this banger
Ted’s just more at home in the Northeast and Midwest than the tropics.
Ed and Ted's Most Excellent Adventure
So like, what’s Next Year’s Trip gonna be?
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I think scientists should study Ted's brain 😂
now eat at every mcdonalds in the country
Fantastic work again
My guy has LOST it
Isn't there a Margaritaville at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri?
why is this video more entertaining than anything on netflix or hulu?  Youre the best Eddy
Just so I can know, how many Outbacks are in USA?
This reminded me of that always sunny in Philadelphia episode lol
OHHH CANNNAADDAAA 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🍁🍁🍁🍁
Give me one margaritaville, Imma…
Dude my dad just got the same shirt that Ted was wearing in Mall of America
Next year eat at every Hard Rock restaurants
I know you said this was it but can you please go to every “dicks last resort”
My autism powers would be happy to eat a cheeseburger in paradise every day for the rest of my life 😂
NOBODY tell this man there are 21 Senor Frog locations
Eddy I work at Alamo Drafthouse do an Alamo Drafthouse video
The Hard Rock Cafe video is gonna kill this man
Did he ever go to Oklahoma? The one in the hard Rock casino in Catoosa?
I do not know why, but the Phoenix joke ruined me.
whose gonna tell him there's actually 200+ countries in the world
Ok now I have to go to margaritaville
"For the second and final time..."  Eddy, you have to visit every McDonald's PlayPlace as a fully grown adult man. Do it, you coward.
Is it Samus Aran's favorite bar
Do McDonald’s next ❤
Missed Lake of the Ozarks Margaritaville
Damn, what menu item relates to the song “who’s the blonde stranger”?   Sloppy Seconds?
I'm still watching, but I can't help but wonder, why choose to rent a pickup truck to drive through the country? Doesn't it cost a lot on the mileage?
Now you need to eat at every bubba gumps shrimp in the country
Ok well eddy now you need to complete the trilogy and go to every bubba gump shrimp company. Also, SoFi is definitely the most ethical sponsor ever and absolutely not the major force behind getting the student loan forgiveness overturned and payments getting unpaused oh no not at all but get that bag my king :3
27:06 were those kids real? Are those your kids Eddy?
I am now asking for you to travel to every Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co. I’ll personally pay for your meal at the Orlando location
This man will not stop until he becomes a mentally unstable shell of his former self.
Complere the trilogy! Hard Rock Cafe!
Next u should go to every Hard Rock Cafe or medieval times
47:06 jameraqui x2
hear me out...every bubba gumps in the country and canada?
Can we get an Applebee’s tour next lol
Should have got the first hat
Jimmy buffet went to my high school. He didn’t graduated tho bc he got kicked out!
waiting for the "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country
Shit I can’t wait until next year.  Bubba Gump? Wahlburgers?Dicks Last Resort? Medieval Times?!
The one in Biloxi made me feel like you were in the Jimmy Buffet version of North Korea.
43:43 Optimus Prime/Primal Jumpscare
I absolutely love the minzy makes you pay Easter egg when he hit Ohio 😂
making an entire museum off of a hypothetical scenario is the american dream
Go to every Bubba Gump shrimp
I hope he does every Bonefish Grill next
Why do you do this to yourself, I saw what the Caffe’s did to you…
Do it again next year, but do BOTH Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville.
Amazing video, shit had me dying
I hope you had a great time eddy ninepins
heres a like for that glorious Canadian anthem
Margaritaville - "I got you"
I might be forgetting something but I feel going to all great wolf lodges is the next move
i live in florida rn and the rain is a big deal. it's ok :)
Im here to see if Eddy included the Margaritaville cruise
.....Missed the Margaritaville in Bossier City, LA
There’s a Margaritaville in the US Virgin Islands !
Did you start before the San Diego Hotel/Restaurant opened in the Gaslamp? lol
You should go to every Cracker Barrel now thatd be something. Ted would have the chance to get the rest of your life force
Absolute masterpiece 👏
Jshlatt cameo
Sounds like it's time for Bahama Breeze? 43 in the nation.
It was fun seeing Destin and Panama! I’m a local :)
the thing is a treasure! i went from tucson to an archaeo conference in abq a few years ago and you cannot imagine how upset a bunch of 60+ year old archaeology/anthropology professors got about it. originally the thing was just a dead monkey in a case but in the early 2010s they reformatted to this ancient alien thing.
I really hate to break this to you… But there is a Margaritaville in Puerto Rico, which is technically the United States.
Do these videos give anyone else a sense of dread and anxiety?
Oh glorious, almost an hour's worth of the same style food adventure! Am loving this so, so much to an unhealthy degree.
Wait, I tought this was Cinnamon Toast Ken, oh well.
The Syracuse mall margaritaville is always dead
You’re a legend
Next year, every Dave and Buster's in the country
your lucky that they location is woodbridge nj is a Cheeseburger in Paradise..... and closed. ITs right up the road from the worst Rainforest Cafe, Also no bathroom review?
From this i derive Ted will accept what life is more then you and adapt to the life that he lives even when in pain
The early tummy ache is rough man :/ Sorry you had to go through that.
That was a good fkn hat why didn't you buy it Spiderman
Destiny USA is a dying mall so im surprised that Margaritaville hadn't closed already
Next chain should be Hard Rock Cafe.
Jimmy Buffet is worth over a billion dollars....tf?
We need a part three of every bubba gump shrimp company
Lol I went to college in Syracuse and I’ve been rocked and so hammered by the margs at that location so many times lmao
Jarvis supports religious people. Religion is currently genociding me at every corner. Fuck that.
fib!!!
Into the margarita-verse is better than marvels past few works.
Holy shit. Seeing the “The Thing” signs in a YouTube video from my favorite creator and not in real life is insane. I see that on the way to my MIL’s house like twice a month.
every Bubba Gump's 2024
honestly only watching this cuz i saw art of this video on tumblr
Can we see Chrissy's song somewhere? :)
Mans hair is getting more and more glorious
Awesome! Bubba Gump shrimp. Hard Rock Cafe. Johnny Rockets. Medieval Times.   You know what must be done.
Well done. More than 3 weeks of straight up mistakes for our entertainment.
37:27 why’d you have to call me out like that?
First rainforest Café, and now Margaritaville! What’s next???? :0
I bet you could make an upsetting amount of money if you released a version of this video on patreon that featured unpixelated feet
Hard Rock Cafe plz
The entire crescendo is "You had one bad shit in 3 weeks?" then fizzle :(
My last name is Spencer
Cant wait to see what adventure comes next year.
30:40 having them not working here really adds to the chaotic feel of cat in the hat, also I didn’t know that the plane was his actual plane at that margaritaville & I LIVE near uni orlando 😭
Next year? Hard Rock Café
destiny USA is a garbage mall
There's a Margariataville in Hawaii
The green m&m winking and kissing at you 😭😭😭
Visit every Dick’s last resort
Impossible Mode: Visit every McDonalds in the US and Canada.
Ok so next year you should do it again but this time go to the bubba gump locations
what is next, Dick's last resort?
Oh shit, the coolest muthaf*ckas on the planet!
My prediction: next year is the Hard Rock Cafe
Isn't Margaritaville a song about a man who can't accept that he's made a mistake?
Now it's time to hit every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in the country lol 😂
Need to this in the uk and do every weatherspoons
The pic of u solo at the ferris wheel was the cherry on top 😂 i did a spit take
I'm from Cleveland and seeing the Tim Misny billboard (the bald guy with his eyebrow up) sent me hahahaha
53:58 holy shit
Sooooo, Hard Rock Cafe is next right…RIGHT?!
you are the peoples prince
Next stop, every Hard Rock Cafe in the US! 😂
Absolutely unforgivable that you didn’t also go to Jimmy’s sister Lucy’s restaurant LuLu’s. There are three locations. Your journey is not over, soldier.
What about the Lake Lanier margaritaville?
20:18 welcome to florida babes
I used to work around Broadway at the Myrtle Beach location and would hear that loud ass burp come from Margaritaville EVERY SINGLE DAY and I hated it so much
How you dare blaspheme Buccees!!!!
Gotta admit, I'm a sucker for Jimmy Buffett & Margaritaville. We usually eat at the Universal one in Orlando when there. His music & message are good too.
he was very brave about his tummy ache :(
Day 18 was when Ted’s Stockholm syndrome set in
13:12 literally made this joke when I went to buccee’s for the first time 2 weeks ago. that store/gas station is truly a magical experience
12:27 LMAO
*the day you have self reflection is the day you have diarrhoea??* Is a quote that will stay with me forever
The sequel is better than the original, what a god.
You should go to every Great Wolf Lodge 👀
Next up: senior frogs
Watched both videos and really enjoyed the different perspectives!
52:40 liminal vibes
This just makes me miss the Cheeseburger in Paradise that used to be in Madison WI.
NAKEY JAKEY <3
Was really hoping theyd show the hotel lobby computers at Margaritaville Biloxi and notice I had put Undertale on them last when I went a few years ago (They dont wipe them, it was still there last time I went a couple months ago lmao)
It texas, near North of Houston, Conroe area there's a margaritaville resort with a Waterpark. Wonder why they didn't stop there.
a few years ago when i was a senior in high school, my choir took a trip to dollywood, and while we were there we got a free night in pigeon forge. i was already poop shy but i was in a room with two other girls that i wasn’t super close with. that night, we decided to go to margaritaville, and i ordered the double cheese burger in paradise. my stomach was literally in so much pain that i ended up crying to the two girls i was roomed with and begged them to leave the hotel room so i could poop. they left for an hour so i could do my business and i destroyed that bathroom so bad that i felt sorry for the toilet. i will never go to a margaritaville again.
If this happens again, it has to be HARD ROCK CAFE!!!!
Now hear me out the Hard Rock Cafe
hard rock next!  Hard Rock Next!  HARD ROCK NEXT!
I've learned more Geography watching Eddy eat at chain restaurants around the country than I ever learned in grade school.
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
This is amazing.
Bubba Gump Shrimp
Wow! You did it again and some! Good on you.
Did schlatt ask you the question
you didnt die in cleveland? Congrats, we didn't kill you. Glad you spent around 30 seconds there.
Everybody’s gotta love the arcade classic Stinky Feet.
Somebody explain to me why I sat mesmerized for a whole hour listening to this. What the hell am I doing with my life?
Do the hard rock Cafe
Cracker Barrel, next summer...?
The worst part about these videos is literally the food.
Bubba Gump Shrimp next?
Hard Rock Cafe is next year right? Make sure to get a pin from every location to commemorate the journey. Then go on a deep dive of the world of Hard Rock Pin collecting.
Do every McDonalds next summer.
Bubba Gumps 2024 roadtrip or we unsubscribe.
accurate syracuse experience
atlanta treats you right 😎
Except the one in Boston
For some reason it annoys me so much to hear him mispronounce Biloxi, Mississippi. You don't say the O in Biloxi, it's pronounced buh ·luhk ·see.
Can't believe the crossover of worlds with the mythical being "Shlatt" was caught on footage
Got lucky, they're also making one in Cincinnati (technically Newport)
I’ve been to the one in Pigeon Forge and I love watching you experience it
Why didn't you come to medford I mean we have a Margaritaville and the rest of Oregon is beautiful
OMG MISNY MADE IT INTO AN EDDY BURBACK VIDEO OMG!!!!!
This is the moment Eddy became Cool Eddy and then accepted himself as just Eddy again. Bravo Vince! 👏🏼
There's a Margaritaville in the Miami Airport.
"I beat the child" - Edward "Eddy" Burback, (1995-2066)
Can wait for you guys to drink at every bar in Nashville
Fucking love these
I’ve gone to the one in Chicago before and my family felt the same way after going 😭 it’s disgusting and we had beard hair in our food
Next is hard rock cafe 😎
Isn't there one on Oahu
What's that sound? I think it's Bubba Gump Shrimp Co calling your name...
All I'm saying is whether the next roadtrip involves Bubba Gump Shrimp or Hard Rock Cafe.... You'll once again feel the pain of the Mall of America. 😂
"I beat the child" --- Eddy Burback, Founder and Leader of the "Children of Burback," and recently canceled YouTube Icon...... You will be missed 🤧🥺😢😭
Hard Rock Cafes next year?
In 100 years people will be watching these videos in history class XD
Gotta go for the 3 peat. Hit up every hard rock cafe
I like how Ted has fond memories of the Rainforest Cafe and Eddy has violent flashbacks
Next is going to all the Hard Rock Cafes
Eddy said this was his "second and final trip like this" way too many times for me to believe him. Looking forward to being back here next year!
when I was a kid, there was a Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant in my hometown. It was a Jimmy Buffet themed restaurant and I would ask to go there every year for my birthday until they closed for "health violations" or something... 😒
From what I know of Jimmy Buffet, he'll probably see this and get in touch with you and give you some kind of beach themed souvenir as a trophy. And he'd probably also want to be in a video.
So whats next? Every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country? haha
I was just in Niagara Falls last week and saw a Rainforest Cafe and the Margaritaville you guys went to. I wish you guys went and looked at that RFC.
Go back to Dollywood! It’s magical.
Your gallbladder is begging you for a break 😅
9/11 and margaritaville - national tragedies - i am glad you walked through blood and bones to make this review happen #key west philosopher pirate the only thing that could have saved this trip was boatloads of marijuana and other illicit substances to dull the abject pain and horror followed by a 2 week stay at the betty ford clinic
This was painful
All I have to say is I'm from Florida, and the rain IS that bad. And it's crazy, but if you get caught in it, it seems to always be going in whatever direction you are.  ... Okay, I'll also say that I liked this video, too. 👍
no reason you'd know this, but Buffett is a Mississippian. That's why the one in Biloxi (pronounced Buh-luxee) is so different.
The premise of these videos are really fun, but the near unrelenting negativity makes them difficult to watch.
SYRACUSE AND CLEVELAND EXACTLY AS EXPECTED!
This video feels like a major coincidence because I'm going to Margaritaville in Orlando
This video should be called Eddy's Slow Descent into Alcoholism
theres a margaritaville in missouri. unless i missed it you didnt go there. made me sad 😭😭😭/ns
you haven't been to every margaritaville in the us. There is one in palm springs lol
This kinda felt like a flowers of Algernon biography but margaritaville
next time, do hard rock cafes.
Ted going to "finish his video" in his own room is a great way to relive the tension of a long road trip.
You skipped the one in Puerto Rico
Great!  Now do all the Hard Rock Cafe's!
Did I miss it or did you miss the one at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri?
I can't help but enjoy the sick pleasure of witnessing someone do this to themselves.
I work at the for the casino that has the Tulsa Margaritaville 🫣
do all the mcdonalds next please
Don’t mean to be that guy, but there’s a margaritaville hotel on lake Conroe
My friend got food poisoning at the Margaritaville in Syracuse. I got food poisoning at the world of beer at the same mall. It's just how cuse is
Hard Rock Cafe should be next lol
from a person from europe who has never heard of this jimmy dude before , this restaurant chain really  does look like a cult xD
As a cleveland local I'm so glad you got to see the billboard. I'm so glad you got to see... HIM
Part III: Bubba Gump. 😂😂😂
Shout out pier park used to get blackout drunk there in high school  and walk around
You didn't go to Jacksonville Beach, Florida Maragaritaville :(
When I stayed at the margarita ville in Atlanta the employees were alot of fun and very nice to us as well.
The content I live for
I didn’t know Margaritaville existed even though I have been to Atlanta, Myrtle Beach, and Pigeon Forge.
Now do subway
But why a truck? Lol. just get an SUV. would have been cheaper and more comfortable
I’ve never been to a Margaritaville, but I did go to the Wahlburger across from it in Myrtle Beach once. Ya know it’s funny, there’s actually OVER 90 of them across the world…wait, why are you crying?
I think you're forgetting a place called 'Planet Hollywood '?
I’m proud of you
There is another Buffet-themed restaurant called Cheeseburger in Paradise....your map doesn't show the one in Syracuse, NY.
Sad to say I’ve been to so many of these margaritavilles 😂
I only watched this video because I live in Syracuse and go to destiny a lot. Your observations were exactly what I expected.
Now do Applebee’s go to every Applebees. See how crazy you can really get
I couldn’t even imagine eating all that food… I’d be pounding probiotics and digestive enzymes 😂
Yall dude are insane. Incredible content
You need to fly to every airport and do every “Air Margaritaville” now. Those are literally inside a fake plane.
I knew the second the twin towers showed up schlatt would be in this.
I'm from florida and the rain is a big deal it terrifies me; also it was cool seeing you drive across paynes prairie for some reason
Did you forget there's one in Bossier City, Louisiana
I am eagerly awaiting the annual Sequel!
Now you must complete the trifecta… bubba gumps shrimp…
28 minutes in I’m realizing I WILL be watching the whole hour of this video which is honestly my exact brand.
Didn't even go to the one in Missouri, which is a shame because its one of the best. It sits on Lake of the Ozarks and doesn't even have Jimmy's name slathered all over it.
Hard Rock Cafe next
Why did i just watch all this?
“The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?”😂
Does your bank question your transaction history
You should do Hard Rock Cafe-
Somehow someway somewhere in the world Joseph Christiansen is foaming in his mouth. You found the Margarita Zone
T. Binkley here. The truth is out there, folks.
Now this is content!
The pop-up green screen is s tier
You mean Bussy's? Fraud video for pronouncing it wrong
That intro had no business being that hardcore 😂
9:38 i think at that moment he actually thought he gets a visit from homeland security or whatever tomorrow morning!or they coming for him right now!😅
bubba gump shrimp 2024?
34:19 yeah, that's Atlanta
This is like a documentary where a man tells a story of how he slowly accepted a cult and became a part of it.
You guys missed the Margaritaville in Conroe, Texas!
For your next cross country franchise tour, try medieval times.
Whats the name of the violin piece at the end of the video?
Did you intentionally skip Margarittaville Resort in Montgomery, Tx 😮 do it…You know you love it. Go. Do it…
Ur girlfriend is hot
Alright wise guy, let’s see every McDonald’s in the us and Canada 😳
"last road trip" ok but what if I told you 34 hard rock cafes exist in america
Nobody tell him about the other Jimmy Buffet restaurant chain, Cheeseburger in Paradise. There are a lot more of those.
Please do the US locations of Bubba Gump Shrimp next year!
im mad, they were in my college town, and i never got to see them :(
I used to live in Myrtle and genuinely enjoyed the Margaritaville there- I have one of my favorite pictures with my best friend from a night we went out there (in a 15 dollar Margaritaville frame of course)
Can y'all do hard rock cafe next time?
Me: Listens to a few Jimmy Buffett songs for a summertime vibe.   The algorithm: “Yo dawg, I heard you liked Margaritaville….”
please go on the margaritaville cruise lmaooo
The cat in the hat ride reminds me of that one scene in the old willy Wonka movie
This was another fun watch! Although I can see that it did take a toll on you guys. The only one I've ever visited was the one in Piegon Forge and once was enough for me 😂 soooo....all the Planet Hollywood's next?😂😂😂
Cheeseburger in Paradise isn't just Jimmy's second biggest song, it was also his second restaurant chain, now defunct. I've never had the "pleasure" of visiting either, but it was a thing. And just last week, I had some fish tacos at a local place in Cape May that was blasting Jimmy Buffett the whole time, and all along I could have taken a side trip to Atlantic City and got the full Jimmyxperience. Alas.
Great video! Wait until you find out Jimmy also has a restaurant called "Cheese Burger In Paradise" and his Wife has a restaurant called "Lulu's". Both in Myrtle Beach. 🍔 🌊
Literally no one asked you to do this but I’m glad you did
YES HOUR LONG EDDY VIDEO YES
dont listen to anyone eddy, you are pulling off that hat fr fr
What about the Margaritaville in Jacksonville.
As a Tulsan, I was waiting for the long Tulsa leg of the trip, you know since we are so close to the beach! I actually work for the slot machine company that made most of those machines you mentioned too. Love the content!
19:00 Why does the Jimmy Buffett quotes look like the warnings on a cigarette pack?
I sat at the boat table in Florida befor
I didn't watch your video. I apologize. I just wanted to tell you that I think your moustache deserves children. If your moustache was a man, it would be the guy from the Dos Equis commercials. Chuck Norris saw your moustache and punched himself out it was so majestic.  I'm done now. I'm sorry for bothering you, Sir. Nice to meet you too, Eddy.
Tbf, that hat looked good on you.
Cleveland resident and chef here. I'd like to apologize on behalf of Ohio, our Margaritaville is in an area known as "The Flats" and is notoriously the worst of all of the restaurants down there. I am saying this as I am 89% sure you got sick from the chicken salad. Again, we are very sorry.
Eddy is Jason Segel you can’t tell me otherwise
So were obviously gonna do every hardrock cafe in america next year right?
Hey there's two margaritavils in Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico's part of United States
You didn't hit the one in Houston or the one in Hollywood, FL
shit! i fell asleep and missed the whole in between of this video.
that Dr. Seuss ride at universal WAS terrifying as a kid. I cried the whole time and my dad was one of those dads that liked to video tape everything so theres vhs tape footage of my dad telling me to be quiet and stop crying while we were on that ride. so validated that you also hated it
Finally, the sequel we’ve all been waiting for.
What about South Lake Tahoe??
When I visit the US my body struggles with the food after like 3 days of just being there, I take my hat off to you sire you have an iron stomach
Biloxi - "BILL-UX-EEE"
Can't wait to see what next franchise you spend a 12th of your year on.
Ok cool now we just need to wait for the Hard Rock Cafe video
Thats a lot of Jimmy inside of you
You didn’t go to everyone because there’s one on the red river in Shreveport/Bossier in louisiana. I would know cause I live there.
Bubba gumps next lol
good video
This was amazing! Thank you for sacrificing your humanity (and tummy) for our entertainment. Now, they do say 3rd time is the charm right! Hard Rock Cafe next year?
You set yourself on a road to damnation and then bemoaned the absence of a loving god.   (I'm going to be honest, that phrase just jumped unbidden into my mind, so on the off chance of prophetic inspiration I thought I'd share)
47:11 😂😂😂
That last big scene, are the going to do planet Hollywood?
Every Buccees in the US?
See you all next year for eating at every single bubba gumps
As an Atlanta native i feel like it was somewhat our job to bring you two the worst traffic imaginable.
why does this man hate everything so much?
I work on the island in pigeon forge, I could've hooked you guys up with some free shit lol
Do Dave and Busters next
How about Hard Rock Cafe? There are 34 in the US.
Glad you appreciated the Cleveland Tim Misny billboard
Why in the world do you rent a Tacoma if you could rent any car?! Haha such a ridiculous choice for road trip vehicle
Next year, you & Ted should eat at every House of Blues in the country.  Jake & Elwood command you. 🤣
These videos are like buying both versions of a Pokémon game.  You know what’s gonna happen after the first one but the differences make it so worth it to go on the journey again.
Next go to every Bubba Gump in the mainland US and Canada with a 40 hour detour to Edmonton between Denver and Las Vegas.
Looking forward to the Bubba Gump Shrimp tour next year.
I want so hard for this to become a trilogy you have no idea
As a European i can´t understand why you choose a PickUp Truck for a Road Trip like this. You decided to rent a car so, you had the free choice.
22 Margaritavilles and didn't see the planes light up and blow smoke while 5 o clock somewhere plays
next stop, Alcoholics Anonymous
That guy looks like Nakey Jakey 😅
YES
I need Eddy and Podcast: the Ride to do some form of crossover, this is Eddy's City Walk Saga.
I think what happened is that while you were at least _pretending_ to have a good time, Ted was spiraling down the drain, but when you finally dropped the act & started spiraling again, Ted started to get giddy & gleeful again.  Moral of the story, Ted will only go insane enjoying a trip _after_ you've already been broken by it yourself.
Alright, time for Chuck E. Cheese.
4:08 Yes? You rang?
Your growth has taken you far above the storms that plague the Rainforest Cafe. You return there a conqueror.
Eddy burback can you consider making a video about watching barbie and oppenheimer 10 times in a row with your friend ted nivison
5:01 casually going on a road trip with tednivison with special guest appearance the man himself nakeyjakey
Margaritaville at Sea next
Alright next year they can go to every Dicks Last Resort in the US a much more manageable 13 restaurants
Hard Rock Cafe next??
44:43 take his advice, I mean it.
"The day you had diarrhea is the day you self reflected?" Is a quote that actively makes me happy
The trilogy of this should end next year with, of course, The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
So glad that Syracuse was unsatisfactory 💖💖 We wouldn't have it any other way in this shithole
You should do Bubba Gumps Shrimp next!!!!! Lol
The aesthetic feels like a Hunter S. Thomson fever dream, as a non-American, it is crazy to me that a chain like this could even exist
So since you are essentially doing every restaurants of the 3rd floor of the mall of America, does that mean Bubba Gumps Shrimp is next?
That shot where we are in between your legs is crazy boy
Do Mcdonalds next
Isn’t there a margaritaville in Palm Springs?
Are you ok lol
Old eddy 9 pins back at it again
I love pigeon forge so fucking much it’s beautiful
Didn’t count, they have to be open for business :P
A newer margaritaville opened in Detroit airport's north terminal ~late 2022
As a man of northeast Ohio showing a Tim misny is very true
Next year you need to visit every Buc-ee’s
They both say this will be their last country journey on the quest of devouring food from a notable fast food chain...until next year when our fierce protagonist challenge the quest of devouring food at Medieval times
I hate Jimmy buffet so I had to watch this lol
Do McDonalds
I’ve never been to one, but every time I seen one I just say “Like the song?” And keep walking, confused.
See you all next year when these two go to every Subway in America
I want a sodium count at the start and end of the trip
No you didn’t
What’s next? 🍤Bubba Jump?🍤😂😂
49:50 Self reflection, Bowel ejection
Now so hard rock cafes
I didn't think I'd enjoy the same type of video soo much but you are a great storyteller and comedian, Eddy, what can I say...
A year ago was rainforest cafe? I need to find a way out of my current life.
Buc-ee's!!!!
Think your next video should be going to every Wetherspoons in the uk?
We waited 45 minutes for you to show us the back lot of Cleveland’s Margaritaville. Thanks, Eddy
Jimmy Buffet would show his naked feet for free. Remove the blur and show us the feet Eddy, be the Buffet.
Next time… every Cheesecake Factory
"Final"?!? Fuck that. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next year, boys!
They should do all the medieval times ending at the jousting at Excalibur 😅
My local radio station just made a section on this video and the obviously didn't watch past the one minute mark because they spent the next 10 minutes trying g to figure out why eddy loves margaritaville much much
I feel like Ted only started to get into it near the end just to bother eddy because he somehow wanted to back at him for this dumbass idea for the second time 💀
But what about the one in Jacksonville Beach....
Go to cracker barrel
what are you guys gonna do next year?
Speedrunning alcoholism
I think the Pina Colada song deserves more love and it's own chain too.
What a roller-coaster ride of emotion highest of highs; and lowest of lows and even some food poisoning thrown in. Great video but though your Rainforest and Margaritaville Cafes are impressive. They are no HardRock Cafe. Proof me wrong 2024 HardRock Cafe challenge.
The cat in the hat telling me my mother visited him is really something I never expected to hear.
Local Key Wester, love your videos man. So happy you got down here to MV after the RC tour. Awesome to see you have a moment on Smathers. Your videos are brilliant and hysterical. Comedy done right. Safe travels!
As you changed latitude you certainly changed attitudes. 100% accurate and reliable representation of a Jimmy Buffet property.
🥸
So they’re doing every Bubba Gump next year, right?
Eddy’s gonna be “wishing away again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again in Margaritaville again.”
Omg im genuinly shocked that he missed the margeritaville in shreveport, louisiana
Omg im genuinly shocked that he missed the margeritaville in shreveport, louisiana
Wait till you see the Buc Ees mascot freakiest thing you will see
Wait what about Capitola, CA?
Why do the alien statues have such nice booties?
My wife and I went the original Margaritaville in Key West, FL. I ordered the margarita and cheeseburger in paradise. To me, it was just a normal, regular cheeseburger, and it was a normal, regular margarita. For a man turning his two most famous songs into a restaurant menu, I expected that to be the best margarita and best cheeseburger I had, and I was very disappointed.
Absolutely excellent video. Funny, sarcastic, touching, sickening, this video had it all! Edited super well too, I loved the Vivaldi touches especially
Idk I don't think being in florida would make most people feel relaxed
Do bubba gump next.
Next year; every Wetherspoons in the UK!
All I can say is next year you've gotta go to ever Bubba gumps
He should do every Hard Rock Cafe next
this is the most american video i have ever seen and i can't explain why
every McDonalds
eddy, if I were you, I would do a lot more than blur your feet, those feet freaks are weird, neitehr you nor I know what they could possibly be into, I would put a black bar all the way up to my ankles just in case  plus, multiple payments, level 1 = ankles 2 = ankles and blurred feet 3 = full feet except toes   really gotta milk that cow
what the fuck. what? "the thing" museum is insane, how does that exist. it must have been so expensive. but why? how is margaritaville a thing? wtf
I did not know of this man's existence until three minutes ago
we need to start reffering to eddy as deep eddy, he said it himself, thats his name
"Tastes like Cindy Lou Who" Then shows picture of a child lmfao
The dude shouting in chicago is 100% exactly what I would expect from some random guy in chicago.  -a guy also "from chicago"
Ahh this reminds me of the time not too long ago (last month) where I was coming home from college for the weekend. There i was driving down the highway down route 2 and suddenly my stomach started turning. I thought surely i could made it too the next exit. I did then thought i would try my luck. After that i nearly shit myself but there, there was a margarittaville right off route 2 in Huron. Thank god i was moment away from shitting myself. Thank you Jimmy for saving my pants.
20:09 *excuse me what*
They just made another one in south padre island Texas I was hoping to see it on the list
now you need to do the margaritaville cruise
this should lower your credit score
The close up shots of Eddy looking completely awestruck or in despair are perfection
this is what I would consider the verge of insanity
Dibs on the next crusa
Organized religion sure looks more fun over there! Food and margaritas while worshipping your god, that's more like it..
That aliens vs dinosaurs place is hilarious. Stopped there super stoned 10/10 would recommend.
Bro - go home
Loved it! But now Bubba Gump Shrimp  is calling to you! Give us the "Every location hat-trick" Please mustache Daddy!
As someone who lives in Biloxi and has never gone to our Margaritaville, nor has any intention of ever going to our Margaritaville, I'm glad you had a decent time 😊
I'd have 2 nickels
lol he makes Ted look so sane
save yourself the money Dollywood isnt worth shit and nether is anything in Pidgeon forge
So, there was a Rainforest Cafe in my city when I was a kid, but it closed a loooong time ago. I had forgotten the music till now. Omg imagine WORKING there 😳
This was an amazing video. Can’t wait until next year when you inevitably go to all 23 Bubba Gump Shrimps in the USA and Canada!
God I love the energy of this video.
Ah yes a truck the worst gas mileage vehicle for a cross country road trip
Now do Hard Rock Cafe
Me going: surely they won’t have another alcoholic beverage with this meal.. oh yes they do
14:25 Like nails on a chalkboard! It’s pronounced Bil-uxi. Ugh. Everyone does this. Idk why people can’t pronounce our names. I mean it’s crazy. I mean Gautier is easy. Go-shay. That’s proper. How bout, the Tchoutacabouffa river? Easy right? Apparently not. Lol. It’s just because we have so much Native American influence. Particularly the Choctaw Native Americans.
There’s two Margaritaville’s in Myrtle beach. It’s called the Landshark bar and grill...
bubba gumps shrimp next
It doesn’t count because he missed the margaritaville in Fort Lauderdale Intl. Airport
Eddy has wasted away again, in margaritaville.
i know of Margaritaville, b/c of alan jackson
You have to finish the trilogy. Every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
Nothing worse than when I have to watch a forced “my girlfriend” cameo  No one cares
Next one got to be Bubba Gump Shrimp it too is in many location like Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville.
ah that was horrible, do it again!
Good God man, why?
As a huge McElroy brothers fan, it was so satisfying to be in on something Eddy didn't seem to be. Jimmy Buffet is a legend, a god. Eddy seems so surprised by everyone at Margaritaville's worshipping of Jimmy, but he really should have expected it.
We used to have one in pensacola...it sadly closed this year. Whyyyy
As someone from Tulsa.  We have a margaritaville?????
You should do senior frog Mexico edition 😂😂💀
I need a video on what happened in Spencers
How about next year you guys go to all Bubba Gump locations in us
There’s a margaritaville in capitola,Ca
Last time? But... what about Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?
so when are you guys going to all of the chilis restaurants??????
Eddy Burback travelling to every Rainforest Cafe: The trip nearly drove me insane.  Eddy Burback travelling to every Margaritaville: Wanna see me do it again?
I was waiting for the least 10 minutes to turn into a Grimace Shake style horror video outta nowhere
on an empty stomach i drank 2 beers 2 shots and 4 1/2 perfect margaritas for my 21st trip to vegas at the Margaritaville in the flamingo. (or was in the flamingo, unsure if it still is). anyways, i woke up at 9pm on the floor of my hotel room. and stayed there till 4am and then went and started gambling and enjoying my time there.
The cult of scientology got nothing on Jimmy
Eddy, I can’t fathom why you made this, but I am so glad you did
52:51 “you look lonely, I can fix that.”
he’s working his way up to every mcdonald’s
Now go to every Dave and Busters. I can only imagine it's next to purgatory.
great video and all, but the fact that schlatt was there absolutely jumpscared me
I don't care if you don't want to do it. Do Hard Rock Cafe next. DO IT NOW 😡
you didn't come to the Margaritaville casino in Bossier City, LA......
Eddy having vietnam flashbacks to the rainforest cafe experience 😂 the terror in his eyes !!
what about the all the margaritavilles in airports 🤨??? hm?????
Ngl I’m lowkey disappointed that the Margarita song didn’t play at any point in this cideo
Hell yeah, Bubba Gump’s next year, right? Right?
43:43 had me gobsmacked. I forgot they made those statues for such a peak film! What a fantastic journey this is!
What's next? Johnny Rockets? Bubba Gumps?
Isn’t there a margaritaville on capitola ca?
Wow huge props to Margaritaville Atlanta.
Wait…what about the Capitola, California location?
54:27 ✨ G I R L  D I N N E R ✨
Hard. Rock. Cafe
Next year you gotta do Bubba Gump
Nah the destin location is so much fun
Every single Hard Rock Cafe!! Have to complete the trilogy.
I really wonder how the universal city walk margaritaville stays afloat. I’ve never seen anyone eat there lol.
Bubba gumps for the end of the trilogy plz
For the love of God...   someone sponsor Eddy to do bubba gump shrimp company or hard Rock Cafe next
Wait Jarvis AND Jordan?!?!?!
Ya but did you have sex with the green m&m?
"The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" Is an iconic line
Good video. Now do this with every McDonald's
Yes yes yes I'm so glad he did it again! Do chuck e cheese next!
Did you bring tums?
Definitely screeched at the screen when you said that Canada was where you had your best meal.  POUTINE NO LESS.  Canada-wide poutine tour in the future? Yes please.
You didn’t go to the one in bossier city Louisiana
What about the margaritville resort in lake Conroe texas
as a person who lives in BIL-uc-see mississippi, hearing you pronounce it BIL-OX-SEE made me a bit angry when you pulled up ngl
The war between the aliens and dinosaurs was one of the most deadly wars in the history of earth. School won’t even teach it, its to brutal
Next year you should go to all the HardRocks in US and Canada
i thought margaritaville was just a south park joke ngl
Bubba Gump next 😏
Three years from now Eddy will be touring every Chili's in the United States and Canada and will run into Joe Biden
Definitely do this again instead
for fucks sake eddy, stop wiggling your toes, I owe too much money as it is
So…Hard Rock Cafe is next right?
Next summer:  I SPENT THE LAST 9 MONTHS VISITING ALL 653 RED LOBSTER LOCATIONS
Brave getting shrimp in Oklahoma
Eddy you need metamucil on these trips!
I cant tell if eddy is a kinda chubby guy or if hes skinny
How to get IBS in just under a month
mispronunciation of biloxi is sending me lol
You become a honorary Canadian, if you eat at every Tim Horton's in Canada
PLEASE DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP
The Hard Rock Cafe is next
As someone who has a universal pass ( for several years) for the Orlando resort, I hate cat in the hat its terrifying! and I had no idea that was actually HIS plane! wow! haha
God the accommodations in nyc are terrible 😂
Yalls gotta do Bubba Gump shrimp next time
Homie went to my home city. The mall I use to spend all my weekends at back when I had friends and even ate at that very margaritaville and even saw my old guitar teacher's band play there. I also know someone that works at that guy's store Eddy went to lmao. But looking at the other ones I understand why Syracuse was the worse. Still happy you checked out my home city and saw how much it sucks.
for the record, the margaritaville cult is absolutely real. like I like some Jimmy Buffett music from time to time, but the sort of people who self-describe as 'Parrotheads'? yeah it's a cult. it's also made Buffett a billionaire. He's one of the richest musicians in the world.
Alright Hard Rock Cafe next. There is 34 in the United States lol
So Hard Rock Cafe is next right?
Isn't there a Margaritaville Resort in The Lake of the Ozarks?
Cant wait until next year when you and Ted hit up every hard rock café!
Okay hear me out every Hard Rock Cafe 👀 lol
Knowing Syracuse is the worst makes my heart proud. Fun fact margaritaville I’m the mall is actually in major debt with destiny USA :) they how them 10s of thousands of dollars
this video was how I learned the magaritaville in my city (Honolulu) had closed down
Took me a second to realize those were margaritas on the map and not a bunch of Samus’s helmets . . .
You seem so much less miserable than the rainforest cafe tour 😂
I can’t wait for part 3!
When's the Hard Rock Cafe Edition coming?
what about the one in miami airport~ ur a fraud
What's next year? Texas roadhouse?
Well, time to do Hard Rock Cafe, Medieval Times and Bubba Gump's Shrimp. Good luck, Eddy!
Uhmm but this is my favorite series ever and it's only the 2nd episode T_T
This was the sequel no one asked for, but was needed
Next year it’s gonna be bubba gumps shrimp babyyyy
The Canadian theme song playing as the giant tequila pours into the blender 😂😂
Next year yall should go to all the Bubba Gumps
As someone from arizona I absolutely lost it when you say The Thing bulletin boards
Can’t believe you copied this video from Ted, how could you?
...but it's weird that it happened twice
There seem to be two kinds of Margaritavilles:  ones on warm Southern beaches and those pretending to be. It seems Eddy loves the ones in Florida and on the Gulf but not the rest. It’s harder to be in the Key West mentality in Syracuse or Cleveland than in, well, Key West.
Eddy watching the rainforest cafe video and the margaritaville video back to back is a way better double feature than barbenheimer, we shall call it burbackenheimer
How often does Marc Maron sue you for infringement?Must be constant!1
This is like you had a mission that required traversing a parallel universe, but in doing so, you occasionally had to go through anomalous pockets of other parallel universes. That's a good road trip.
i was about to come on here being like "oh, he forgot the margaritaville in Capitola" only to find out that what i thought was a jimmy buffet margaritaville is just a place that's been catfishing me for years...
I can't wait till next year when he visits all the Hard Rock Cafés
You should do every CPK in California
Soooo, a perfect version of a cocktail refers to a specific ratio for the recipe of the drink.  Think a Perfect Martini, etc.  Not sure what they thought they meant in Jimmy's restaurants...but I think its a sugary mixer in there that is cheap and bad.  Also, Canadian chain restaurants continue to slap because...they actually put in the work to do a good job.  Dunno why, but it makes it so much better.  And frankly, if your national dish is fresh fries with brown gravy, cheese curds and a protein?  You GOTTA know how to cook.
question is, where to next year
The way he pronounces Biloxi hurts my soul 💔
love that that was all that was said for syracuse lolll
Okay, now do every Hard Rock Cafe in America
When I search "Jimmy Buffett", this is the first video that pops up, beating all the music videos from Jimmy Buffett.
you should go to every mcdonalds in the u.s next year
Someone get Justin McElroy on the line!!
Go to all the raising canes
Can we get a counter every time he said margarita /ville
For a hot second I thought Ted was *punching* the whack-a-mole game 😂😂
I’m glad Ted is getting a taste of his own medicine with this one
next year do hard rock cafe
Imagine running into a drunk Time Square Eddy omfg LMAOOO
is bubba gump next?
U should go to every buc-ee's
This video came up in my recommended yesterday and I started watching it but stopped like a minute of the way in. Later that day I’m at Navy Pier in Chicago with my family and my family decides to eat at MargaritaVille. I had never eaten there before nor even heard of it up until seeing this video. Crazy how I somehow just ended up there lol.
Now do subway
I wanna say a personal thank you from me for entering The Thing exhibit. I didn't shell out the money to actually go check it out while I was there, so I'm grateful you put up footage of what the exhibit actually looked like.
First time I've seen a company I actually know/use sponsor a YouTuber
There are two Rainforest cafes in Europe in Paris and in Malta, and you could start in Paris and take the train to southern Italy through Switzerland, and then a ferry from Italy to Malta. Just saying
Surprised y’all didn’t stop at the one in Conroe Texas 😢
We stan Buddy
i got stuck in that cat in a hat ride once
Isn't there one in Missouri?
Missed one in bossier city Louisiana
Just here for the completely random one in Cleveland. Like, sure, it's on the lakefront (or as close as it can be), and I love Cleveland, but I never expected to see a Margaritaville in Cleveland, Ohio.
Chili’s next lmao
Who tf is footing the bill for these ridiculous trips
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
38:18 Eddy I need you to know my first car had a bumper sticker that said WWJBD that I purchased from Margaritaville
I noticed the little rhyme after the cat in the hat ride
You should go to every Hard Rock Cafe on earth next...
Bro it’s pronounced like bill luck see
Next cheesecake factory.
If you do this again by chance, I’d highly recommend visiting the only T-Rex Cafe in Disney Springs.
I hung out at the Margaritaville in Key West all the time cause a buddy of mine worked there throughout high school and I got food poisoning at least 8 times.
This series cannot end until you visit every single McDonald's in the world.
Now do medieval times next year
cant wait for "Eating at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country"
Crazy idea next year hard rock cafe  36 locations…
You should travel to every cedar fair park or every six flags park
FYI, Mall of America isn’t the largest mall anymore.
Okay so I live in panama city beach, and there is a hospital being built right next to the margaritaville retirement community (1 of 2 Margaritaville communities in our town) . Everyone has started calling it the Jimmy Buffett hospital and it isn't even open yet
Next challenge, visit every McDonald's in the US
What about the margaritaville in the detroit airport 😟
My family stopped at The Thing most years on our annual family vacation to Texas - 25 years ago. I have tried to explain it to people since then without any hint of them understanding. Thank you for documenting your trip there. The gift shop looks identical, but the exhibit has gotten a huge makeover from when I was a kid.
👍👍👍👍
Next up bubba Gump shrimp
Tim Misny made the video!!! Yooo
The broadway at the beach is the only one I’ve been too. Best atmosphere i remember as a kid on vacation but definitely didn’t remember it for the good food 😂great video
I have the third embarkment ready for you… every Hard Rock Cafe in US and Canada. Please make this happen next year.
Every subway
Can't wait for you to go to every single McDonald's
51:06 Ah yes, Stockholm Syndrome
what the midwest does to a man
It isn't about the destination, its about the journey. Especially if your destination is Margaritaville.
isnt there one at myrtle beach
Jimmy is love Jimmy is life
How did he get such a hot girlfriend. That stache ain't doing him no favors. I guess that's where his wallet comes into play. lol
It bothers me more than ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD that there is not an end quote for that at @3:58
My biggest takeaway from this is that Rainforest Cafe food is somehow healthier than Margaritaville's
this guy doesn't know what boom boom sauce is
ok but like can every Bubba Gumps be next
Was excited to see your reaction to Cleveland as a Clevelander….. so disappointed
Good news there’s 22 Bubba Gump locations as well.
what a bizarre reason to travel the country. but i enjoyed every second of footage you captured devoting your sanity to our lord and savior, jimmy buffet
Lol the close up of the trash in Times Square. God. I love nyc
This is the best video I have ever stumbled upon. I couldn't stop laughing from the Rainforest Café, to the absolute hilarity of the after shot of you and guys after Chicago. I loved it.   Edit: Jimmy's Jamin Jambalaya, omg.
Every time Eddy says margaritaville you’ve got to drink. Good luck!
A true legend 🎉
There’s a margaritaville in Jamaica that has a water slide that goes into a pool, with a bar in it, and one side of the pool is a beach, and the other side of the beach is the ocean, and you get to watch cruise ships dock with Mick Jaggers house in the distance. No joke lol look it up
As a southerner, the way you said biloxi sent meee 😂. Love your videos dude ❤
Big shout out to the Atlanta Margaritaville staff!
Was that Nakey Jakey?
15:56
Now do every McDonald's.
If this doesn't sum up the Atlanta experience, I don't know what does.
yall do not know how to say Biloxi😭
This video was so good, this can't be the end of the roadtrip vids
Ok so idea for next years trip would be to look up the best local chain restaurants in each state and going to them. Have it be a nice little bash that takes you all across America, plus it will help keep you from burning out by being different stuff each time and different quality levels
All the BubbaGumps next. Get to it.
my first ever concert was to see jimmy buffet. weirdest day as a 6 year-old ever
Bubba Gump 2024
Wonder what odyssey these boys will go on next.
what about all the Margaritavilles at airports around the country??
Eddy, you are an inspiration, and an absolute unit. I would follow you into a Margaritaville volcano with a bucket of Perfect Margarita. I am in awe of your accomplishments, and I salute you.
Next: I went to every McDonalds in America, Canada, and Japan
Imagine the Dr. Suess ride on pure LSD lmfao
who gonna tell them they missed the one in Conroe TX
Find the McDonalds that still serve pizza.
When will we get another Ted and Eddy adventure
I once overheard someone say to their friend at a bar... "You look like the kinda guy who blindly invest in a rainforest cafe" 😂
Chuck E Cheese
eddy u forgot so many that are in airports
The Thing is a nation treasure
You didnt go to the one in Tulsa.
15:57 weak.
Chuck E Cheese
Barbie ❌, Oppenheimer ❌, I went to every margarita ville ✅
Bubba Gumps for 2024
Didn’t want to add in Margaritaville at Sea into the mix? No, I don’t blame you. Also suggestion on the next restaurant……Hard Rock Cafe. Good luck.
You are a failure, a failure to go to MARGARITAVILLE and RAINFOREST
omg, positive comments about florida, my thirst has been quenchesd jesus christ.
This was amazing! Cinematography 👌🏾 Narration 👌🏾 Jimmy Buffet 👌🏾 Do Hard Rock Cafe next!! 🫣
gf
Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe or House of blues would be some solid next ones!
The only next step is quite obvious...MARGARITAVILLE CRUISE  🌊🚢
Soooo….what about the margaritaville in Palm Springs? 😂
Lmao the censored toes killed me 😭
I think there is a margaritaville resort in Conroe tx….you have to do this again
What bizzae chain restaurant cross country road trip will he take next that will have him experience occasional Margaritaville PTSD?
Idea for next year; every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the US and Canada.
next one should be every rainforest cafe in the world or continent
What a perfect blade runner reference!
Starting with Eddy and gunna see how Ted rounds his vid out. Love these dudes and this glorious content.
My vote for next year is bubba gump!
17:22 You did what to the child?!
Hahaha Ted just beating the ever-loving hell out of the whack-a-mole game was incredible.
Gee u look so happy in the thumbnail. I gotta watch now!
The rainforest cafe trauma is definitely the funniest part of this thing. Love you eddie
Why the f*** did you rent a pickup truck for a road trip? Wouldn’t literally anything else be better?
7:07 i think he might have richasshole disease
As a Canadian, let me say, Eddy, don't rest on your laurels yet! You've gotta eat at every Montanas in Canada!
its not even that these restaurants exist, which is painful enough, its that an entree is 22$, that is just criminal
46:32 fucking Minsy yassified eyebrow [s] make her pay
Aight, now it’s time for Bubba Gump Shrimp
Now to eat at every Chilis in the country. See you in a few years mate.
Next year, you should do the Hard Rock Cafe
‘for the last time’ yeh fucken right Eddy, yk you like this shit.
As an upstate NY native and SU alum, I was unreasonably excited to see Eddie's reaction to the syracuse location in all its shitty glory.
I can't believe Eddy Bareback literally wasted away in margaritaville
this was so much fun, but if there is a next series of this, i would love it if they put a little highlights reel/superlatives at the end. like best/worst food, menu, service, location,  atmosphere, etc.
eddy now has rainforest cafe ptsd
Waiting until Minnesota to order the Jambalaya after driving around the Gulf Coast is an amateur move.
17:24 Are the ducks in the Stinky Feet game supposed to be holding their non-existent noses with fingers that... shouldn't exist either? Is that red thing on top of its beak meant to be its nose? This is giving me an existential crisis
I look forward to next year at bubba gumps
Ok, next year I can think of two options:  Every Medieval Times...there's far fewer but they are so spread out the trip would take just as long...maybe throw in the King Arthur themed one in Vegas...or...Every Macaroni Grill in the US.  Thers's 39...minus two in Hawaii unless you're absolutely insane so there's 37.
This will be Taylor Swift in about 20 years
Lies! You didn't go to South Padre Island Margaritaville! Liar! I want my money back!!
There are 22 Bubba Gump Shrimp companies, just saying.
Isn't there a margaritaville in Conroe TX?
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co has to be next
Eat at every Wafflehouse or you're not the REAL Eddy Burback
why?
I remember back when I lived in San Antonio I always walked past the Margaritaville and it kinda smelled like piss, just like everything else at the riverwalk
not again
43:46 me when women
Jeez buc-ees merch guy must be killin it! 😂
Planet Hollywood next.
Visit all hardrock cafes
https://youtu.be/dPn33kAtdLU
Please do bubba gump’s shrimp next
What if Jimmy Buffet stopped the alien / dinosaur war??
My heart literally skipped a beat when Eddie pronounced Biloxi. No shade I just was shocked. BTW it's pronounced buh-luhk -see
Eddy, I have terrible news… you guys missed one! The only one I’ve been to is in Osage Beach, Missouri  You must go to see the amazing and totally not underwhelming - misery inducing - Lake of the Ozarks!! 😂
Eddy, I remember when you had a cult. Now you're joining Jimmy Buffet's cult. SAD!
LIAR! You didn't visit every Margaritaville! You didn't visit the one on Lake conroe in houstan texas. Hope to see you there someday :)
Post watching: sounds like your gallbladders are shutting down
Thank you for your POV.  I enjoyed your honesty and humor.  😊
HARD ROCK CAFE
Aliens and dinosaurs what if museum had me laughing super hard 😂 thats what happens when a meth head wins the lottery and has a brilliant idea 😂
This is a lie, you didn’t go to the one at Lanier islands in GA :(
Losing my mind at y'all going to atlanta. I just had a FEELING about the highway.. itsa mess here
What about the Margarittaville resort in Conroe Texas? Sounds kinda fraudulent to say you ate at all Margarittavilles.
now go to every mcdonalds in america
Absolutely unsurprised that halfway through you started to "get" Jimmy Buffett & Margaritaville. It's such a vibe.
holy fucking shit
Me, a person who works at Cat In the Hat watching this: 😀
If you’re looking for a stupid road trip for 2024. I found it. With 22 locations in the United States, plus one location in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, you could go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant in the US and Canada. There are four in the SoCal area, one at each Universal City Walk, one at the Mall of America, San Antonio River Walk, Times Square, yet another Florida supercluster, and then a finale in Las Vegas. You and Ted could make the trilogy of American themed chain restaurant road trips.
Man is a modern day flagellate
Please do Waffle House next
I can’t wait for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. US Tour next year!
can't wait for the senor frogs sequel in a year
Bro, you didn't visit every margaritaville in the US. Just say most of them
jimmy buffett is on epstein's list and you just gave him all that money
👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you for your service Mr. Griswold
The sequel we didn't know we needed and definitely didn't deserve. But we got it, and it was beautiful.
Please do Cheesecake Factory next.
What about the one in Puerto Rico? @EddyBurback
The Cat in the Hat ride is SO SCARY. I’m so glad someone else agrees.
I want the next one to be a “race around the world” esc thing, every whichever restaurant chain in the country, you and Ted vs whoever, you split at the start and which ever finished first wins something. Probably intestinal issues if some kind
Bro what? I live in Biloxi (Which the way you pronounced that was so interesting) I’ve had birthdays at margaritaville arcade. This is such a collide of worlds
i dont know why the picture of you by yourself before the ferris wheel is CRACKING ME UP
i snuck into the fort Lauderdale margaritaville to go into the pool when i was twelve
You haven't done nothing til you visit every MacDonald's in the USA
You should go to every 6 Flags Theme Park and rank the rides!
So when are you going to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country?
So what's the next chain?
I’ve heard rumors they are opening a new margaritaville in pittsburgh
I'm glad you saw the Tim Misny sign. They're all over the place in Northern Ohio
Next do all the Bubba Gump’s in the country
Why?
Soooo Bubba Gump Shrimp????
Next year, do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
29:51 Warden is that you?!?
Bro did you miss the hurricane at the myrtle beach Margaritaville. Its like that volcano eruption one on steroids'
You skipped Jacksonville.....
Also, NEXT YEAR. HARD ROCK CAFE WORLD TOUR
I'm from Florida & it rains like this & I hate it
I hope Anish Kapoor sees this video and seethes over your chants of "bean bean bean".
sitting down with a margarita to watch this
Do all the hard rock cafes next year :)
"Final" suuuureee Bye Jimmy's Mom
Next year Ted and Eddy are going to go to ever Bubba Gump Shrimp.
Now do a mini trip and do all of Paula deen’s restaurants 😂
I got the jumbalia at the margaritavile im nyc lmao
Wait no Palm spring’s?
I WILL PAY FOR YOUR TOES, PLEAAAAAASE
Super Duper Size Me
Ted reminds me of Egon from Ghostbusters
fun fact: I'm named after one of Jimmy Buffets daughters
What restaurant is next?
Go to every subway pleaseeee thank youuu
The one in palms is mid
I was in San Antonio staying on the river walk at the end of may and the start of june and I almost stopped at margaritaville
I think that dude was wearing the same clothes that he was wearing the year before when he took a picture with them.
every benihana in the country next?
Funny thing about the plane: it was shot at by the Jamaican government with Jimmy Buffett and Bono aboard. Jimmy wrote "Jamaica Mistaica" about it
Every Joe's Crab Shack next?
can you do McDonalds next?
Ive been to a Cheeseburger in paradise restaurant that was a failure in the philly area and it was not good.
Doubt it
What about Shreveport, LA?
Did you come to the one in Bossier City?
No Jacksonville Florida stop
I can’t wait to see what chain you two decide to hit up next year.
No Margaritaville Resort in Conroe?
Cool - now do McDonalds
Mr. Buffet, took me to paradise
12:28 Eddy having PTSD of last year with Fortunate Son playing in the background. Colorized, 1963
Seeing Eddy film at locations I’ve been to before feels very strange…
Eddy, I'm sure it's just because it wasn't a "restaurant" but ai won't consider this a complete trip until you go on the Margaritaville cruise.
Now go to every Bubba Gump resteraunts
Yo wtf there’s one in Oregon who you trying to fool
As someone who lives in Syracuse I have literally no idea how the Syracuse location has stayed open for so long. There's never anyone there. Ever. The blender broke years ago, btw. Nobody's bothered to fix it.
Quality
oof kamo joke missed vibe khek my see key is brokeee
In Orlando they have two one in city walk and one in the margaritiville hotel i dont think you ate at the hotel one
I worked at a restaurant that was Jimmy Buffet style/theme. It wasn't a Margaritaville. The owner just really liked Jimmy Buffet. Because it was an individual owner  vs large corporations so it was WAY MORE Fun for the employees and most customers. Also, not being a chain, the food was decent. It was more of a seafood/ fresh water restaurant with a cpl burger options
MOREEEEEEEEE
Looking forward to the Hard Rock Cafe video next! 😎
What about Palm Springs margaritaville
So you ate at every margaritaville in north America. Nice😊
ah, the syracuse margaritaville. literally one of the worst restaurants i have ever eaten at.
None of the food looked very good, especially for the prices. Looked like frozen food out of a box.
As a non-american..... How many golden Corral locations are in america?
Jimmy really is just a boomer hippy
You should've been alot more drunk in the making of this video, only then can you understand buffet
will be tuning back in next year for the hard rock cafe road trip 🫡
Eddy, I love you and I love the video but I can’t help but notice you didn’t make it to the Margaritaville Resort in South Padre Island in Texas. It would’ve been one hell of a drive but you didn’t even mention it :( as a South Texas native I felt hurt that it wasn’t even mentioned. Loved the video and love you
Me waiting the whole video for you to go to the one in the Lake of the Ozarks and you never did. So technically you didn’t go to every one in America 😕
Eddy, you have to complete the trilogy, you have one last place you need to to visit to close the circle and that is...  Hard Rock Cafe
Missed opportunity to have the introduction to Jimmy just be "Hi, I'm Jimmy" and hard cut to the trip starting.
Time to go to every Chuck e Cheese
I went to the opening of the JWB Grill and he wasn’t even there. 😢
I think hard rock cafe needs to be next!
Of course the strange man dancing on a curb was filmed in Florida lol!
Omg...the sequel. Sponsered by Jimmy Buffet 😅
When will Eddys  top lip see the light of day?
"It's mellow, but not smooth. Kinda shitty." "Jimmy Buffett!"  - Yacht Rock Episode 11
Hard Rock Café next?
Go to every Cracker Barrel next
Man that footage of Pigeon Forge brings back memories. I still remember going in that Titanic museum as a kid!
Please eat at every Tommy Bahama's restaurant next.
YOU SKIPPED THE ONE IN BOSSIER CITY LOUISIANA 😭😭😭
now you gotta do the hard rock cafes
i always forget eddys from wisco and then he drops in something like wisco dells and it catches me off guard lol
Next year you have to visit every hard rock cafe
Please go to BUbba Gump next
56:01 🤣
If I’m not mistaken, you guys missed the Magaritaville locations at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, as well as the one at South Padre Island, Texas.
I just really want a margarita now smh
I fucking love Margatiaville!!
theres an off brand bougier margaritaville in cape may new jersey called key west tacos i love that place
Naked Jacob!
There are 33 Hard Rock Cafes in the Continental US and Canada. Do it a third time.
His tummy hurts 😢
I’m sad they actually missed a Margaritaville resort that’s in lake of the Ozarks, but to be fair it doesn’t have the Margaritaville restaurant but has the others that jimmy buffet own like Landshark bar and grill!
Next idea: they go to every bubba gump shrimp, but instead of driving they run like Forrest would.
Why did you skip Jacksonville
to quote the immortal chris flemming: "his entire discography is just one giant ranch dressing-soaked siren song for giving up [...] stop tempting me you board-shorted nymph! [...] i will not slide over to your cheeseburger dark side"
I’m pretty sure there is a margaritaville in Jacksonville Florida as well
Florida gonna Florida weather lol
How does he not schedule a break day to go eat at a good taco stand and sleep at the half way mark
even being a florida citizen who’s been to universal many a time, i’ll forever be traumatized by the time the cat in the hat ride broke down right next to the animatronic cat in the hat taking a bath
You should have had to listen to only Jimmy Buffett the entire time you all were driving. Really engulf yourselves in everything Jimmy.
So is next year gonna be every hard rock cafe in america or every remaining chuck E cheese
Can’t wait to see eddy and Ted eat at every chilis next year 😅😂
Will you two please drive to Boston once our Margaritaville opens up in what will inevitably be January or February? 🙏
51:59 hahaha
What about the Margaritavilles in Puerto Rico?!?
Next you should do Medieval times
Ya'll should go to all the yellow deli locations in the...world!!
Hard Rock Cafe next?
eddie please keep doing these every year they’re my favorite
Time to go to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co
Vivaldi
Margaritaville Myrtle Beach, it's called southern hospitality😊
LETS GO!!!! I cannot wait to watch this, god i love this series
I love this humor. My wife thinks I’m nuts. Fins up!
Feel like Hard Rock Cafe will be next, has more locations tho so it would be longer and harder but idk
Wait holy tortellini    Is that nakey jakey?
What if margaritaville was good?
All these beach shots look absolutly beautiful
this series hits the hardest, thank you for enduring the pain eddy
Ted looked a little too guilty at that 9/11 joke someone loook into his background asap
Former Tulsa Margaritaville server here. The volcano goes off every hour and they play Margaritaville. It's awful. The casino is actually owned by the tribe. The area is just Margaritaville themed. The little characters you mentioned are actually from VGT (Video Gaming Technology) which started as a local company that makes and maintains slot machines for casinos. I used to have some of their shirts lol.
I can’t wait for the next one called I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
Okay but who else here doubts this is gonna be the last time they do something like this?
Wasting away again in Margaritaville.
Literally watching this on a road trip through Atlanta to Nashville
Next year you need to do bubba gumps
You didn’t go to the Margaritaville in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands, which is technically part of the country
You should do medieval times next. There only 10 locations around the US
i love eddy kept specifying that this was their last trip across the US because he was going so insane that he cannot fathom doing it again
So where you going next year?
You should do bubba gump next 😂
This is real I was actually the guy who was flying like a plane
I remember going to the Margaritaville cottages in Orlando as part of my grandparents' anniversary in the Fall. It was really nice and homey. We also went to Gaylord Palms to go see ICE and had Krispy Kreme donuts at one point. It was a really nice time. They also had a nice tucked-in space where my little brother could sleep.
You didn’t go to the Conroe TX location?
this is Art
How come not the Margaritaville in North Houston ( Montgomery,Conroe Texas) ?
I live in palm desert and seeing the sign get drove past in the vid i was shocked
I love that Ted bought a "Thing" shirt, it really adds to the insanity
so when does the Outback roadtrip , the roadtrip where you go to all the Outback steakhouses in the USA and canada, come out?
Didn’t you miss Palm Springs? Hmmmmmmmmm
As someone who has been to Syracuse multiple times, I am absolutely not surprised with the quality of any location there, let alone a Margaritaville
I have never been so glued to a randomly recommended YT video in my life.
Deep Eddy? I thought your name was Eddy Nine Pins?
Wait, did I blink and miss the Capitola, CA location?
SHOW ME THOSE GRIPPERS DAMMIT
For the next video you should go to every McDonald’s in the US
Eddy is a tummy ache survivor.
You should've taken mushrooms before Capt. Zeus ride! Js
Gross
i double dog dare you to try every Chillies in US FUCKING A
i havent gotten to it yet but i really hope they stay at the resort in orlando lol.
Travel to ever Dave & Busters next
and you still only covered the US and Canada, time to go to the carribbean
Amazing excellent video, I loved the rainforest cafe caper. The Margaritaville voyage was an great follow up.
Frozen gourmet food
Hope you enjoyed Biloxi! (Bih-lux-e) The MS gulf coast is fun. Glad you got to experience my state even if it was just for a Margaritaville!
13:04 Perv...
The thing!!!! Bro I've been there it's a museum!
The guy who you saw twice is wearing the exact same outfit as the first time. Just adding to the insane coincidence 14:00
The bladerunner reference at the mall of America had me cackling.
I wonder if even the big man himself has been to every Margaritaville
What's the classical score playing during the final Margaritaville sequence?
i thought the eddie chribbs was dating was a random.  it all makes sense now hahahaha
i have another good journey for you and ted to go on, visit every cedar fair park in the us (and canada)
Can’t wait for the 3rd road trip next year
NEXT VIDEO: Eat at every Dick’s Last Resort
“The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea”what else are you supposed to do?
not the hero we wanted, but the one we needed....
Wait till these guys find out about Applebee’s
Did I miss seeing him try the 2 in Ohio or did those not count for some reason? There's one in Cleveland and Sandusky.
That was so cool how they saw the same guy in Texas two years in a row lol
but what about hard rock??
Now do McDonald's
1:58 It's Ted Nivision* like "Television" 😅. Get your friends name right lol
As a Cleveland resident I was thrilled to see Tim Misny make an appearance at 46:30 good stuff
Summer 2024. Visits every Hard Rock Cafe in US and Canada.
hi edy burba
Bro you're just a male Safiya Nygaard
I actually clicked onto the video wondering what the heck Margaritaville was
So Buba Gump Shrimp company next year?
Biloxi is pronounced like Buh-luh-ck-see, not like Bill-ocks-see
I love how he showed the Tim Misny billboard. Truely iconic where a guy can advertise with just his eyes.
I would love to see the invoice for this video during tax time, just the insanity of so many Margaritaville receipts, lol.
i need a price break down 😭
okay now do forest gump
Fun fact; the tiki hut boats you saw in Florida were on the water bars that you could rent out and take out on the water, and yes, they did come with a bar tender included. Those tiki boats are really popular around the gulf and the Florida keys 🎉
Actually as a Floridian i can tell you the rain here sucks because it always shows up when you don't want it and it comes down hard
...But why?
Fun fact: as a kid of around 4 or 5 years old, my family went to Universal and I forced them to ride the Cat in thr Hat ride with me 8 times in a row. That eighth time broke them.
That The Thing museum is basically a rip off of a trading card/comic series Dinosaurs Attack! And Mars Attack vs Dinosaurs Attack!
The fact that SoFi is void in Florida but you mentioned it in the Florida segment is ... priceless
Now eat at every McDonalds in California
Hey bud. You can stop now.
I'm so happy Tim Misny made it in to the Cleveland portion
But you didn't go to the one in Medford, Oregon??
Next year do Hard Rock Café
Dear God man. I grew up listening to Jimmy buffet, he's not bad. This is insane tho.
So Hard Rock next year?
hard rock cafe next!
u drove past my house 😮
Oh. My. God. He has returned
Honestly proud that Canada had the best locations for both rainforest cafe and margarita ville. I don’t know what that says about us, but it says something!
Omg, every time I pass by the Margaritaville in Destiny, it's dead empty. Mystery solved, i guess lol
I went to the one in PCB during springbreak back in 2021 which happened to be on my birthday. Ran up a $190 bill, yacked in the bushes, broke a chair and got carried into tootsies🤣😭
there’s one in the detroit airport too, i don’t expect you to buy a ticket just to get in though
Lookin good there eddy
What about the Atlanta location?  Place is a SHIT HOLE!
Syracuse native here. Yea our margaritaville fukkin sucks. That whole mall does. Don’t go to it.
I live in Syracuse, and the one in my city sucks. They owe a ton on taxes and is always closed. LOL!
What I think we really learned through this journey is that Ted feeds on Eddy's suffering. The more Eddy fell apart the more fun Ted was having. Curious, is it not?
Okay, coward, do Applebee's next.
As someone from Mississippi, I was so thrown off on the Biloxi pronunciation.
For those wondering what the billboard was for Cleveland, it is for a lawyer named Tim Misney. He has a billion commercials where he uses the slogan, "I'll make... them pay!"   He has been on the air for so long that he now buys five second commercial spots that just say, "I'm Tim Misney. You know what I do."  He is so well known that he doesn't even have to show his whole face anymore.
on my second watch of this series lol
Every medieval times 🏰
There are 33 Hard Rock Cafes and 34 Bubba Gump Shrimp Companies in the US.
Shitty walk?
Do McDonalds next year.
First video I've seen by you and it was truly entertaining.  Good production and a healthy dose of satire.  Good times..... in... Marg...arita..... ville.
I am so happy this was made
I literally got so hyped when you went to Bucc-ees lol it’s a cult for real
Was that...nakedjaked?
46:31 has the greatest Cleveland icon of all time, tim misny.
So awesome that you saw Drew... and you saw Danny... and they were not the same person ... they may have similar lives, they may have similar wives... 🎵
48:10 is the best part. No one else is right about the best part.
BROOOO my FRIEND saw that DOG like 5 YEARS AGO!!!! BROOOOO GAS StATION post comment
Do every chilis next
I bet you won’t do it twice
Just an FYI for everyone. If you travel through Atlanta, you will be late. Doesn't matter add atleast an hour
Y’all missed some
I think you mean Pina Coladaburg!
clicking off because Jesus' name is used in vain within the first ten minutes. L
Y’all were in Tulsa around the same time as me probably and I didn’t run into y’all absolutely heart broken lmao
See you next year when you hit every bubba gumps
and not one simpsons margaritaville reference. i am sad. 😂
I love how this is a complete flip of how you and Ted reacted to the Rainforest Cafe trip
Can't wait for Eddy's suicide note when he eats at every McDonald's in the US and Canada
There's 34 hard rock cafe's in the United States.... just sayin.
Buc-ees is holy ground
I am very sad that you abandoned the map graphic like three margaritavilles in, smh, blocked and unsubscribed
Why do I care about this ….. do I have a problem?
A causal NakeyJakey at the first visit
i got a headache from jsut watching this tbh
As an Arizonan who makes trips all over the southwestern part of the state, thank you for giving The Thing the love and rep it needs. It's horrible and I hate it but I cannot deny it as a part of my heritage as an Arizonan.
The "resort in orlando" ISNT EVEN IN ORLANDO! ITS IN KISSIMMEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hey those pipes to the giant blender in Pigeon Forge are suppose to be moonshine stills 😂
Bubba Gump shrimp next
Can we get a Bubba Gumps or Hard Rock Cafe next
Bro you didn't go to the margaritaville resort in conroe, TX?
well that was dumb of you
I dare you to go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada....and Mexico.
I am also from the suburbs of chicago but have not gone to margaritaville :P
Yikes!  What a depressing proposition.  This endeavor was really taking one for the team.
If you enjoy going to Margaritaville that's fine but just know you are garbage.
48:18 Fraggle Rock opening vibes
I stole a salsa dish from that Rainforest Cafe in the Mall of America
do every ruths chris next, then when you get to mt pleasant go to camilles prime instead
Now do the Hard Rock Cafe next year
as an employee of universal i WORKED next to jimmy buffets plane all this time and had nooooo idea either buddy... so... i feel worse haha 31:20
Jimmy Buffet is from that part of Mississippi so it makes sense that he’s such a popular figure. We go to the Biloxi margaritaville for New Years 😂😂
I forgot that there’s a margaritaville in MOA even if I’ve been there probably like a hundred times
If I had a margarita sometimes multiple times a days for like 20+ days I think I’d just have a permanent migraine from the tequila lmao.
You've got to visit the Margaritaville retirement community in Florida. There was a New Yorker article about it a year ago. Seemed pretty tight.
Hard Rock Cafe next
52:53 “you look lonely, I can fix that”
I had no idea who Jimmy Buffet was until I read the name "Cheeseburger in Paradise" and realized that he's the guy who wrote that god awful song, which played every single day back when I worked as a ticket taker at a waterpark. Yes, it was as bad as it sounds
Lol the one Indiana closed
Did I watch both videos yes was i extremely excited both fucking times? Yes
This is what America is all about actually. Feels good.
33:20 I REMEMBER THIS omg i was genuinely fucking terrified of the hurricane as a kid
"Yesterday all I ate was a breakfast sandwich, and a cheeseburger. Today my stomach hurts. I blame the establishment"
dont tell eddy that he missed the margaritaville in jacksonville fl............
Yo your left eye sucks at doing it’s job.
Riding the cat on the hat ride on shrooms was the worst
time to do bubba gump shrimp, international trip!
Less margaritaville, more bean.
Lmao as someone who lives near Biloxi i dont know why you put yourself through this shit. I've been there twice and that was one too many. Oh and its pronounced buh-luck-see lol
You HAVE to go back to DollyWood!!!
you wasted 24 days but i wasted 58 minutes watching a masterpiece
let be written into cannon, that Eddy beats kids (at arcade games)
Bossier city margaritaville?
Having only been to Syracuse Destiny USA’s location, can confirm, very sad
Did you guys go to the one in Bossier City ,La?
Try going to every location of Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo cantina!
This was a nice way to relax after having some edibles. Thank you
There's actually another Margaritaville in Texas. There's a resort and restaurant at Lake Conroe. Maybe you just didn't video tape it but...
Did you skip Margaritaville in Panama City beach?
all those sugar filled drinks had to rekt your teeth lol
Isn’t there two margaritavilles near pigeon forge? One in pigeon forge on the island and one in gatlinburg near the aquarium
oh my fucking god im not american and did not know wtf was a margaritaville prior to this video but the statue of liberty holding a margarita made me laugh so fucking loud that's so american
You went to atlanta and there was traffic? Welcome to our lives every day here unfortunately
As a European im asking, is all this normal?
I prefer Pina Coladaburg.
Why the Fuck is it not called Jimmy's Buffet
Scrubbed through this because I live in Syracuse and wanted to see what was said.  The video did not disappoint.
Isn't there one in lake Tahoe?
Was that Nakey Jakey at the first one? Thank God. My friends and I all thought he died  as he disappeared for the last 3 years except for the album release. Also enjoy Key West before it drops below the murky depths of the Gulf.
New sub
Next year is bubba gumps
I think we know what’s next… BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP
petition for Eddy to visit every buc-ee's in the country next summer because he could totally just make the gas stops between different destinations and having fun  EDIT: I made this comment during the buc-ees section, before watching all the way through to where he said he didn't want to do another trip like this. Eddy should do whatever he wants to do for content.
I mean for the memes y’all should go do all the Chuck E. Cheese
I cannot believe you skipped one
Is this gonna be your thing now, going to every mid sized chain restaurant in north america?
"Our second and final road trip like this..."  So you're telling me not to hold my breath for you eating at all the Bubba Gump's? :(
i wonder if the alien’s asteroid was bluetooth
you should do it again but with chuck e cheese
Oppenheimer ref??? 48:44 music is from the soundtrack 🤩🤩
Isn’t there a Margaritaville in Palm Springs?
Can’t count how many times this video has been recommended to me
missed the one in Waikiki?
Jimmy buffet the bar cult
i enjoyed all 59 minutes of this video ur truly a legend
Can’t wait for Cheesecake Factory next year
Luckiest man in the U.S.A and Canada!
God I was hoping it was job for a cowboy playing the Doom EP once the smoke Stop but I guess I will stop thinking about the unpredictable anymore but then again it's 2023 and nothing shocks me anymore
Can’t wait for Cheesecake Factory next year
Can’t wait for Cheesecake Factory next year
i triple dog dare u and ted to eat at every bubba gump shrimp co in america next summer
Watching both Ted’s and Eddy’s videos on Margaritaville is like playing through different versions of Pokémon
You really need to team up with Jet Lag to see who can eat at the most Olive Gardens in a week or something.
It was the Las Vegas one that made me realize if there is a hell, it’ll be Margaritaville.
Why didn’t you go to the beach in Chicago?!!
What about the Lake of the Ozarks Margaritaville in Osage Beach, MO?
I ate at the myrtal beach one recently haha that giant margarita is so weird I got it on video too lol
disappointed that your first collab in this video is with a racist
There’s a larger Bucee’s is in Tennessee, now. We outdid Texas.
the american palate amazes me. these dudes went on a refreshing camping trip in the middle of a margaritaville gauntlet, only to make... MORE meats and cheeses?!?!?
Eddy this video is awesome
Here we go again!
Can't wait for next year
Eat at every McDonalds in America. Eat your heart out Morgan Spurlock.
Now do McDonald's
Is that nakeyjakey top 10 YouTube’s NA at the first place
this whole thing is so fucked. tears streaming down my face in laughter and confusion. I love you
I thought this was going to be a documentary on Pablo Escobar 😂
Now all we need is eddy to eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the United States and Canada
Eddy goes to a Bubba Gumps Shrimp Company: “Did you guys know theres a whole cult based around a Tom Hanks movie?”
Do you ever eat vegetables
You guys should do every McDonalds in America next!
Do Bubba Gump next
there has to be a third in this series
I licked the bean
Margaritaville in Honolulu, Hawaii?
Every bubba gump shrimp next
As a Canadian we do things different which includes our Margaritaville's. You should go to Fallsview casino lol next time
You should do Bahama Breeze next
Can I just say the editing on this video is awesome
Fantastic video who knows what their next adventure might lead to maybe Chuck-E-Cheeses perhaps but who knows.
Next season every hard rock go global baby
Ted copped some adderall in Chicago
The year is 2034 and Eddy Burback has visited every McDonalds in the USA.
The stomach problems is all the sugar bruv.
You crazy SOB, you did another crazy and stupid vacation and I love it.
You are a brave man for eating so much fried food and consuming so many sugar drinks. You're doing it so we don't have to.
as a rock climber... the actual URGE i felt to reach through my screen and climb those volcano walls at the resort was FIERCE.
OH I thought you meant Jimmy Hoffa, and that Margaretaville's founder was under a park somewhere, and that some random person, like Ed Lohane from Portland, Idaho, has his finger bone but nobody believes him and there's no DNA testing kit for 500 miles, but one day he and his meemaw are gonna use all of their savings to get a bus ride to the Boise police headquarters.
He has to do McDonalds next
I can't wait to see your cracker barrel road trip next year.
next one's gotta be hard rock
Margaritaville and Rainforest cafe should reimburse you for your food/drinks... epic adventures!
Now quit your job and eat at every single mcdonalds in the world.
I can’t wait to see where y’all go next year, lol.
Do Cracker Barrel next
You should do the Hard Rock Cafe next
52:25 is the funniest by far
Can't wait for next year when they eat at all taco bell locations
Fun fact Eddy, that Ferris Wheel is where I proposed to my fiancé last year. I guess we both had special moments there. 🥲
As a person who lives in Syracuse and went to destiny all the time as a kid before it fell apart, I feel a strange sense of accomplishment from finding out that we have the worst margritaville in the United States and Canada.
Time to go to every Bubba Gumps next year. Lol
Do Bubba Gump's next you coward.
i love the thing
So let’s get down to business. How much to see them toes?
Things I learned from these road trips  1.) Canada has the superior quality restaraunts 2.) Florida is a close second 3.) Buc-ees is amazing
You skipped the one in the Ozarks
Ngl me and my stepdad go to the Tulsa location twice a month, not half bad
@22:06 coolest guy in the world my ass. That's just a typical Florida man
Eddy I appreciate you but as a Minnesotan why did you get the jambalaya up here of all places
You had so many margaritas in so few days that you probably gave yourself permanent acid reflux even without the food
Do bubba Gump next year
Cut walk is hands down the worst margaritaville in the country.
I want your lifestyle. How can i accomplish this?
"We had to book it to Atlanta" There's gonna be terrible traffic  "Traffic completely stopped" Yeah sounds about right
I love how these videos let Eddy perfect his A24 stare.
Did you mean to mispronounce Biloxi cuz that like stunned me fr
Do a road trip to every Six Flags next year
Next one should be every waffle house or Whataburger
We went to Canada and stopped at a city close to the border to get lunch, so of course we went to Margaritaville
Why didn’t you go to the one in Palm Springs?
tummy hurted cuz seed oils causing inflammation
I used to run that same exact stinky feet game when I worked at kings island in Cincinnati in high school. Hearing the song gave me whiplash LMAO  Also I was just on a road trip a few weeks ago where my partner and I stopped at every buc-ees on the way. I kept saying I would love to see this idea become an eddy burback video
I watched this video while I did cardio. 7 miles on the elliptical. Wished I was running toward Margaritaville. Wished I was free ✌️
Do Bubba Gumps next.
Next time: every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in vegas
I love this man
Can't wait until next year when you guys go to every TGI Fridays
Ok that Statue of Liberty was pretty dope 😂
yall missed the margaritaville in conroe texas and im actually so pissed
Bubba Gump next?
Please keep the roadtrip content comin!!
49:41 Ted's DNA changed from eating at Margaritaville 🤣
Hang on, you skipped Margaritaville Lake Lanier
Next is every Hard Rock Cafe
I can't wait for "We ate at every McDonalds in North America" in a couple of decades.
Eddy needs tums
As someone who passes by that "The Thing" sign frequently, thank you for sacrificing your money and time to show me what nonsense is inside.
I thought it was just a South Park joke.. I didn't even know we had those in Canada!
Now do 711 😈
Eddy + Ted = amazing videos
friendlys is next
Spaghetti Factory when???
Margaritaville was written in Austin, Tx about 160 miles from the Ocean and originally was going to be called "Wasting Away Again in Austin, Texasville" #livemusiccapitaloftheworld #keepaustinweird
Bubba Gump Shrimp is next I gotta feeling
Ive been many times lol. I miss the Jimmy Buffet Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants, had one near my house.
u missed puerto rico friend
Y’all skipped the resort on lake lanier 😔
26:32 dawg cmon you can’t give them this for free
As soon as I saw the title I was awaiting your reaction to the hurricane at the Myrtle Beach location, ha! Every half hour, just like the volcano, a "storm" occurs, a giant tequila bottle descends from the vortex and "Rain" pours into the bottle. Then the song plays. It's very dramatic 🤣
Next trip for Buc-cee’s, Hard Rock Cafe, Johnny Rockets, Medieval Times, or Dave & Buster’s??
Unironically, the state of the Margaritaville in Syracuse basically sums up Syracuse as a whole...
“What would jimmy do” 😂
I like how Ted is actually in pain this time
I live in South East Arizona and I've never been to The Thing even though I've seen the signs thousands of times. Thank you for curing my curiosity Eddy
I WANT BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP AS THE NEXT ONE!!!
My ex’s family love Jimmy Buffet enough to have a license plate that says WWJBD? And my ex has been to like 2 Jimmy Buffet concerts in utero
Isn't there a margaritaville in jacksonville beach?
Whaaat? I had no idea the Nola Margaritaville was gone. How will New Orleans survive the loss of the rich culture that establishment to such a vanilla city like New Orleans.  Somewhat related story: I had a friend who lived in an apartment overlooking Margaritaville in Nola. So, of course, I promptly went to his balcony and went to yell "JIMMY BUFFET SU...." but my buddy had tackled me and covered my mouth and, in a very aggressive tone, said "YOU CAN'T DO THAT. MY LEASE ACTUALLY STIPULATES THAT I CAN NOT EXPRESS ANY NEGATIVE OPINIONS ABOUT JIMMY BUFFETT OR MARGARITAVILLE DURING BUSINESS HOURS."
Which margaritavile was from Jury Duty
ok then next year mcdonalds cross country
The blade runner gag was gold
DO BUBBA GUMP'S NEXT!
Foresee a third trip I do
That’s why I prefer pinacoladaburg
Do Applebees next!
There is a Margaritaville in my home of Syracuse isn't there! Holy Shit!!!
im so happy we have a part 2 to this amazing series
This is the saddest title on YouTube.
22:00 I love the implication that he only turned to Jimmy because of a tortuous 9 hour drive, followed by being left alone with no one but Jimmy
I live in Florida and the rain can lick my taint. Also: You guys should do every Chuck E Chees's for next year's road trip because Ted can sperg out at the Animatronics. Also: why? Why did you go on Cat in the Hat? Why would you go on that flaming dumpster fire that even the most diehard of theme park nerds wouldn't go on?
credit where credit is due. Each restaurant is slightly different
I went to the one in San Antonio during TMEA, you made the riverwalk area look way better than it did irl Also the convention center doors are only locked one way so I walked out onto a balcony then couldn't get back in and had to find my way to the river and follow it back until I found the front entrance again
Consider doing Hard Rock Cafe next. Currently there's 30+ locations in North America including 1 in Canada and another in Hawaii. Ignore all of the other ones overseas cuz that will increase the number to over a hundred. Only do it if you royally hate yourselves though.
Margaritaville in Jamaica was sick, someone did a magic trick with a cigarette and burned a hole in my shirt
Eddy - you did not go to the Margaritaville in Downtown San Diego 😢 only commenting this bc I saw it there a day after watching your video
Someone painfully describing the acts of Jimmy Buffett while Vivaldi plays in the background was a form of high art I was not ready for today.
I delivered you a sack of oranges not too long ago. I hope you enjoyed them 🍊
Medieval Times! There’s only 10 of them spread out inconveniently across the country! Do it!!
Currently 38 minutes in… I’m dreading the MN one. I’ve been there… it’s not good
As a Cleveland native my favorite part of the video by far was the Tim Misny billboard
I have a vague memory of going to that Universal Orlando Margaritaville and seeing someone get a lap dance on the stairs
37:51 I love how the voice over doesn’t even address how dead they both look… ted looks like he’s about to keel over
Weirdly enough I think the Whoville dark ride is based on the Wiggles dark ride. I mean, look at all the similarities.
You're just conveniently going to leave out the Margaritaville Resort on Lake Conroe and still claim you ate at them all?!
well since it doesn't feel that impressive, it just means you need to go to every of something else in the country!
"energetic orchestral music"? put some damn respect on my man vivaldis name
alien GYATT
BOAT
Hard Rock Cafe's next?
I love the things you pay attention to. Great video as usual!
Shouts out to that Atlanta staff. I'm from GA and those are the kinds of moments you really appreciate.
margaritaville is real???
Now he’s got to finish off the trip by going to Hard Rock Cafe
29:51 you are actually pulling off that hat though, with the shirt and everything it suits you!
luckily there isnt one in hawaii as then  the tacoma would have to be sea worthy
You just know that in a million years the only remnants of this period of history will be the aliens vs dinosaur museum and a jimmy buffets.
i mean if you really wanna do this again next year… hard rock cafe……….
Wait you mean to tell me this isn't cinnamontoastken. ?
There are 33 hard rock cafes in US and 2 in Canada just saying.....
Eat at every McDonald's in America next
Why does the girl at 4:53 look soooo familiar… what’s her name?
Broken Lizard's Club Dread is a pretty fun send up of the Jimmy Buffet phenomenon/cult
The Jimmy Buffet cult is called "Parrotheads" btw.
Now you need to visit every senior frogs
One man’s journey into alcoholism ❤️ The American Dream
I honestly was not expecting another of these but I thank you all dearly for your sacrifice for the content of the youtubes.
As a Wisconsinite, hearing Pigeon Forge compared to the Dells makes me so happy. I said the same thing when I visited Pigeon Forge 😂
this made me really want to go to Margaritaville
glad you enjoyed your revisit to Minnesota and the Mall of America :)
Doesn't count you didn't do the cruise
i spent new year’s eve at the Biloxi Margaritaville, glad y’all had a good time
15:27 Midsommar (2019)
DO BUBBA GUMP NEXT YEAR
Next year do a pilgrimage to Pigeon Forge. Y’all won’t regret it.
I felt that I felt so much of their misery just by watching this video. Thank you guys for doing a patriotic act of duty.
I’ve been to that San Antonio one lol   The Riverwalk is pretty dope though
My Syracuse margaritaville holding up well I see lol
LA people freaking out about rain😅
So what's next? Cracker Barrel? Hard Rock Cafe? 👀
Did they skip Jacksonville Beach?!? That resort is peak FL/Margaritaville culture lol
As a new viewer I am impressed not only by the commitment, but also the story you told along the way. That said, you seemed to have missed the one in Shreveport / Bossier City Louisiana.
Hard Rock Cafes are next….
Nice. Now where are you going next year?
Next year… bubba gumps shrimp and co
What about the Margaritaville in Buford Ga?
Please do Medieval Times!!!
Now do every McDonald’s in the USA 😂
glad you also could experience the atlanta traffic
NOOO HE GOT ROPED IN BY THE THING HAHAHAHA
Next year: I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in America and Canada
But what's the only fans??? Feet finder?? I NEEEEEEEEED to know!!!
stupid video and stupid waste of money also lol all the food went right to your face.
Anytime I've had to drive through Atlanta it has been the most grueling mind numbing experience
atlanta loves u guys
Next time your in Chicago, do the boat tours at shoreline sightseeing and ask for Josh as your tour guide 👀
Okay but you didn't go to the Margaritaville in Shreveport Louisiana???
what is up with you people and drinking alcohol through a straw oh lord send help
I think next year they should do every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
hope jimbo sees this
6:00 “I have a stomach ache… must be the food… I had two margaritas”  Yeah must’ve been the food and not the alcohol
Simply amazing
Thank you or your sacrifice
There’s one at the lake of the Ozarks Missouri…
watching Eddy's video and then Ted's is youtube's Barbenheimer.
GO TO CASA BONITA
16:07 I can't stop watching this
Ah man, speaking of buc-ees, one time i went to a renaissance fair with my friend's family, and we were going to stop on a buc-ees on the way, and her dad was SO EXCITED to go. Singing about it the whole time. I... still don't get it, but I'm glad he was having fun.
Lizten. If you need a zhorter tour before your next annual trip, Zorbaz is a great choice. Mostly jn Midwest, alwayz on a lake, all 's's replaced with 'z's
The irony of doing a sponsor read for a deal that's specifically void in Florida.... after just talking about Florida in the video.
When are you gonna do Macdonalds
turns out my favorite types of videos are just increasingly deranged travel vlogs in which the person is constantly wishing they could just go home
The sequel to the video that I never knew I needed, that I never knew I needed. What an unnecessary yet OH SO NECESSARY masterpiece.
i live in syracuse and that margaritaville has been begging to die, hopefully you have given her that wish with this video thank you for your service LMAO
32:03 She's a keeper
rainforest cafe PTSD is something i never thought would exist
Would you rather go to every rain forest cafe in the US (and Canada) again or watch Morbius for 7 days in a row
Jet Lag The Game should do a season dedicated just to Rainforest Cafes, Margaritavilles, and Bubba Gumps and have Eddy and Ted
Don't chicken out now, you gotta do all the Hard Rock Cafes
Looking forward to McDonald's for next year.
Your health must b 🤢
My only experience with Margaritaville was on a vacation on the island of Cozumel in Mexico.  Our group of 4 had just arrived and we decided to walk from the resort into town instead of taking a cab.  It seemed pretty close and we were sick of sitting through the shuttle, cab, and plane rides to get us there.  Well we were not used the 90 degree heat and sun, and it was a 2 mile walk out in the open.  When we finally reached the edge of town, the first and only place we saw was JIMMY BUFFET'S MARGARITAVILLE blasting Jimmy's 80's hits out the front door and looking very much like it had shade, drinks, and bathrooms.  Greatest restaurant ever, and nothing will convince me otherwise.
BILL-LUX-E
Looking forward to next year's video with every Hard Rock Cafe
I’m glad you did this twice! Thanks for the great content!
Next year road trip to every Dicks Last Resort.
The YMH Crew would love to know about this.
2024: All 1,569 Applebee's
I absolutely love how much random other info about things that are seemingly unrelated but only slightly related within it being.. there.. exists in this. I WANNA GO SEE THE THING SO BAD
We just moved to Minneapolis and visited the MOA Margaritaville, prompted by my wife's observation that "With the nerve to call themselves _MARGARITAVILLE_ they'd better be grand supreme."   I had the "Perfect" Margarita and my wife had the Watermelon Margarita... and
That traffic was from memorial day weekend. I was driving back from dead and co and saw that nasty traffic
Imagine next year they do the Hard Rock Cafes 😂
Why the heck would you rent a truck for a road trip?
“The traffic literally is not moving” YUP that’s Atlanta 😭 everyone drives aggressive but no one knows how to drive
THE CAT IN THE HATE RIDE IS LIKE BEING ON ACID IT IS CRAZY
what about the other margaritaville in Georgia
Maybe it is time for Cheesecake Factories! Haha!
Thank you for your sacrifice.
Did I miss part of the video or did they skip the Gatlinburg location?
Great Video. Spent a long time trying to locate your upper lip. I've come to the conclusion I have to trust that it's there....
next year they should go on a trip of every states most obscure restaurants or tourist attractions
You didn’t eat at them all, we have two in Oregon and one in Washington that I have been to, LIAR!!!!!
I was excited when they said they were heading to New Orleans because I thought they were going to do a bit where they showed up at the New Orleans Margaritaville only to find that it had closed in 2016 and is now a BB King's Blues Club.  Thus launching season 3, where they visit every BB Kings.  But, turns out there are only 3 remaining BB Kings and none of them are in New Orleans.  That location closed during the pandemic and is now the new home of One Eyed Jack's, a music venue I have fond memories of from my college radio DJ days.  This has been a journey.
Do hard rock cafes
I’ve actually been to the the first Florida Margaritavile, it wasn’t that bad
Next year do Medevial Times or Bubba Gumps
That’s Atlanta people
I can't wait for them to do this again next year but with Bubba Gump Shrimp
eddy is literally my dream man.
Amazing video! Now so all the Hard Rock Cafes in the US and Canada!!!
I wanna live like jimmy buffet now.
Yea that’s florida, it’s awful here I hate. rain is only fun when you’re inside and not stuck outside
Is HardRock Cafe or BubbaGump Shrimp next?
My favorite YouTuber Deep Eddy
I literally thought this was a re-upload of the Rainforest Cafe video for three days.
Tfw you ignore the main quest for 2 months and just grind out the collectables just to get an achievement.
Not to burst your bubble, but there are airport Margaritavilles in airports too.
As a Tennessean, he missed the Margaritaville resort in Gatlinburg (20 min from the pigeon Forge resort). Their mediocre margaritas kept us warm from the freezing Gatlinburg December while we waited on our reservation for a restsurant down the street.
Just outstanding content. Cannot wait for whatever this trilogy's version of The Return of the King is.
Oh bless your heart, the two “jugs” in pigeon forge are supposed to model a moonshine still 😂
“I ate at every Margaritaville in the country”…. Bossier City is pissed!
There’s no link in the description about where or how to pay for Eddy’s uncensored toes and I have never felt more teased.
Y’all skipped the Margaritaville in Conroe TX
Missed the one in the virgin islands, gotta redo the whole thing now
To complete the journey, consider Margaritaville at Sea. 2-night/3-day cruise out of Palm Beach <3
the mispronunciation of biloxi shocked me right back into reality
I love how you each have different bits and show more of different parts between your videos. You and Ted's videos on this are completely different even though it's about the same trip.
Ayyy glad to see Syracuse made it on the list. Also glad to see it was the worst. That's pretty average for Destiny USA.
I had my first legal drink at the Margaritaville at Universal City Walk.
How much.
The Thing exibit is so bizarre haha. All those billboards for that 😂😂😂
your pedostache is terrible
Petition for eddy and Ted to go to all Hard Rock Cafes
Me, outloud, Eddy why would you—
I’m sorry you had to be in Miami 😔
29:46 I’m anxiously waiting to see if you got the one on Lake Conroe, Texas.
This is such a weirdly nostalgic video as someone who spent all of their childhood summers being packed up into a van and driven around the country. My mom was a huge Jimmy Buffett fan back in the 2000s, so naturally whenever we happened to end up near a Margaritaville we'd be going there to eat. Having been to atleast 6 of these locations myself including both the Universal California and Key West locations, it's such a trip seeing you guys drive these highways and going to these places that are core memories from my childhood.
There used to be  a couple of restaurants in Central Indiana that were Jimmy buffet themed called cheeseburger in paradise. They all disappeared in the past 10 years or so. Are those still a thing in areas of the country?
u should go to every hooters.
Visiting every Buc-ees next?
Hard Rock Cafe should be next
Ok boys.  Your next challenge is every Hard Rock Cafe on *Earth*.
First video I've ever seen of you and i must say, i really enjoyed your Ed Kemper mustache.
Next do all the Bubba Gump restaurants 🙏
2:30 MONEY
One day I’d love to do this but I’m not that courageous. Love the video
Eddy, I'm NOT KIDDING. HOW is ur tummy?
phenomenal video. you are hilarious and entertaining and i liked all the little side quests
Hell yeah another pointless road trip i loved the rain forest café one so i bet this one is gonna be good
I think they missed the margaritaville in MIA
as a european, this is incredibly bizarre and fascinating at the same time
So I dont want to discount the chance that the food is making your tummies hurt, margarita mix is well known to cause sour stomach issues.  Its the sour mix or whatever acid they use in the mix of ready mix drink recipes that usually makes your tummy hurt
Bubba Gumps is next ?
Did y’all not go to the resort in Conroe, Texas? Is this trip incomplete?
I sure could use some Safari Fries right about now.
PLEASE do Bubba Gump’s next😂
Having ideas is hard, I guess.
Now you gotta do every hard rock ;)
Bubba Gump next year...?
20 minutes in and this video already mentions feet an upsetting amount of times
if you would have just combined your rainforest café trip with the margaritaville trip you could have maximized your agony and cut down on your carbon emissions. just saying!
35. Hard Rock Cafes. See you next year
Did anyone else see the 2 coolest guys on the planet?
Can you do cracker barrel next? 😂
The picture had me cackling
There's actually more than one in development, as there's also another one being made in Florida
Next step: Applebees
Thank you. I pass by those “the thing” signs a lot and my curiosity is finally satisfied
Is that Eddy Ninepins?
I’m laughing so hard cause I loved the rainforest cafe video but as a Michigander I know this video is forever incomplete… as Michigan has the only airport Margaritaville that I know of other than Florida
i can't wait to see the next one of these next year !
As someone who lives in Panama City. I absolutely love the fact he was here and loved pier park so much idk why I got so happy
Why is Samus in the thumbnail
You know what you must do…  Every American and Canadian Hard Rock
So next year is it Bubba Gump's?
Eddy is a tummyache survivor
26:00 his joker arc starts
I'd love to do something like this. Out of curiosity what kind of budget did it take to pull something like this off?
I live right next to pigeon forge. Sorry you had to deal with the new buccees traffic on top of the horrid tourist traffic.   To anyone reading this: don't come here it's not worth it
is that "cat in the hat ride" just "the Wiggles" dark ride redecorated?
You should eat at every Taco Bell in the US next. You’ll live mas
So when you going to all bubba Gump shrimps
I vote for Bubba Grump's next year
I just wanted to see you guys go to the Hollywood location because I’m from there but I will see the whole video through because of all the pain you guys endured
Next one, all the Bubba Gumps in the world. More resturants and 2 outside of the United States
Imagine being Eddy’s bank and looking at his transaction history over the past month and it’s just margaritavilles, gas stations and hotels.
thats gutsy to try this im happy it paid off for you. getting pushed in my suggestions.
Lmao i lost my 2 friends in Bucces for like 20 minutes .
next year it's gonna be hard rock cafe, predicting it now
I find it funny that you were probably in New York when I was there for 2 weeks for work and I recreated the Blade Runner scene with the M&M store on Times Square for my friends and family just like this because i was so exhausted 52:51
i love that you really gotta watch both to get the full lore
How much sanity will it take you to go across America to go to war at all the Hard Rock Cafes that are left?
Ok do hard rock Cafe next. There's like 35 locations in u.s. and Canada.
Every time I walk past the Syracuse Margaritaville, I’m surprised it’s still open.
I lived in Texas for a few months in 2021 and I frequented the local Buc-ee's religiously.  They also had a red pickup truck with a massive Bucc-ee plush on the bed.  I swear he got a little bit bigger every time I went there.
He had a cameo in Jurassic World! My dad howled when he clocked it and had to explain to me why
Seeing the Margaritaville in Tennessee was so nostalgic for me, haven’t been there since I was really young
Best quote of the trip, “the day you have self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?” Amazing! 😂
one can only wonder where he could go next
But... why Eddy?
I think Buccees needs to be next boys.
Eddy, to finish off the trilogy, Every Hard Rock Cafe
Yeah Syracuse is like that lol
as an Tennessean, Dolly Parton is our Jimmy Buffet and Dollyworld is our Margaritaville. Would suggest checking it out
Next you need to go to every Hard Rock Cafe
What about the Margaritaville on Lake Lanier in Georgia?
What happened in New Orleans!?
I love these long road trips with you two. Then the first thought that popped in my head after was "What if they went to every Joe's Crab Shack next year." And i can't stop thinking about how Eddy would actually kill Ted in that case
Your monologue about why you would do this again is exactly what I was thinking when I saw this video on my feed.
When are you doing every waffle house in america
I have a Margaritaville themed bike. It has a pineapple cupholder (I named it the Pineapple Express)
as a syracuse native who has fond memories of the (formerly) carousel mall: :( but also fair
But they do say that 3 is a magic number …        Part 3?
"New Jersey" my favorite words said by "cool eddy"
The Caribbean jerk wings are so good. Used to eat them at the local casino when I was like 12 years old haha
JAKEY SPOTTED  EDIT: That jambalaya was 100% microwaved
Can't wait until next year's Hard Rock Cafe video
Moral of the story: Jimmy Buffett was in our hearts all along
But you didn't go on the margaritavile curse.
Until next year when you do the 34 hard Rock cafes
Can't wait for "I went to see Barbie 7 days in a row"
if you were able to have mcdonalds 3 times a day every day it would take nearly 13 years to go to every mcdonalds in the US   in case anyone watching this had the thought of "i should go to every mcdonalds in the country for a video of my own"
I find it funny that I seriously was just at that PCB margaritaville not even a few weeks ago
Holy shit, after seeing the Thing segment, that one Doug episode finally makes sense.
Hey Eddie, just wanted to give some info on the Tulsa location you visited. The casino (including hotel) are owned by the Native Americans, the Muscogee Nation. Margaritaville is simply an attraction for the casino, hence the signage about luck with all the sharks and such. The characters you mentioned are actually mascots of the various games in the casino. Mr Money Bags, Lucky Duck, and Ruby Red to name a few. I'm glad that location was a good one!
Do subway
I hope Eddy does a eat at every Waffle House.
Next time it should be every fuddruckers
Looking forward to you doing this next year at all the Hard Rock Cafes.
I feel a little uncomfortable wearing my bucees shirt during this video
I've never even heard of Margaritaville
There is a margaritaville on pensacola beach in gulf breeze, FL. You guys are gonna need to fly to Pensacola to knock that one out.
beautiful
Ok but when are we getting more spring flowers crewnecks in the shop tho 😭😭😭
NEXT all Bubba Gump Shrimp!
i cant wait for next year when they do Hrd Rock Cafes to keep upping the number of restraunts
ur such a brave tummy ache survivor
chuck e cheese next
Doesn't your friend Ted have a channel? I swear I saw watched him few years ago.  What a wild video to be on my homepage 😅
what theme park is in this video
mustach
This is barely 3 days old and it’s already his 10th most popular video. Lol. Nice. Update: 5th. Nice.
"pokay nachos"
WASTING AWAY AGAIN AT MARGARITAVILLE
Can’t wait for the “visiting every McDonald’s in America Trip”  Nothing better than a 13,000 point trip through all of America
next do bubba gump shrimp
Amazing job. When you do every Bubba Gump’s I’ll buy your dinner in SF!
sad that they skipped lake lanier islands bro, theres a whole margaritaville water park there with a GINORMOUS screen hovering over the slides that plays jimmy concert footage all day long. interesting experience to say the least. and yeah, my family 100% got season passes.
How can I pay to see your feet unblurred?
i know that this is a funny haha video but some of the cinematography and running gags and background music truly makes this video an immersive and emotive experience
in my years of seeing atlanta's food service industry first hand, I'm very shocked with how the Atlanta location played out. I called it being closed before the posted time, but huge shoutout to those employees I hope thier bosses see this and promote them
Medieval Times next!!
Now do all Hard Rock Cafes in the US
Hell yeah Tulsa! I live in the apartment complex next door to that casino, and I have a wild deeply traumatic experience with that Margarita Ville! Hope y'all didn't get cursed! (also it's owned by the Muscogee Nation, the Margaritaville branding is just licensed)
You absolute mad lads
Hard Rock Cafe and or bubba gump shrimp (?) next
Not even 5 minutes in and Eddy has determined it’s a cult 😂
I clicked ahead in the video, then aliens and dinosaurs were having a war.
Ya know… bubba gumps got 22 locations in the US. Another one?
all hail jimmy
Eddy: *dying from Margaritavillosis* Green M&M: You look lonely ... I can fix that ... ;)
is ted in your video?? 4:33
I'm surprised yall haven't gotten sponsored by Toyota with this one
That traffic in Atlanta happens every single day.
I'm glad to know that it only took approximately a year to recover.
Hard Rock Cafe next  year?
Not gonna lie, love their Nachos.
EDDY DID IT AGAIN FOLKS WHAT THE HELL MAN
If anyone is wondering, the first location is the one from Jury Duty
Maybe the real Margaritaville was the friends we made along the way.
Eddy- I'm so sorry to tell you this but you did not in fact go to every Margaritaville, as there are several in airports in the USA, including Philadelphia PA. ☹️☹️☹️☹️
Hear me out...BUBBA GUMP.
Go to every Wahlburgers
Next year.... all the cracker barrels?
Do Chilis next
Next year, every Bubba Gumps (22 in the US)
Another banger from Eddy "cool guy" Burback!
One time I was having a crisis while out in Jax beach and then I woke up in the margaritaville across the road from the bars. Which is 20 minutes from my house. $250 later, jimmy sang me to sleep while I was scary drunk
eddy is so lucky that the "cheeseburger in paradise" chain closed down
as soon as i heard “tight schedule” and “atlanta” i knew there was going to be a problem
I saw this video and just thought…why. Couldn’t pass it up.
Shame you guys couldn't spend more time in Pigeon Forge or experience the Cincinnati location that closed. I prefer his soundtrack work over his tropical music.
I know you kept saying you'd never do another trip like this, but what if you found smaller themed restaurants to visit? much smaller scale and potentially promoting small, locally-owned businesses?
My wife and I watched this together and made love for the first time without her boyfriend, thank you.
I’ve never been to a Margaritaville. I have been to Lulu’s (owned by his sister) in Gulf Shores, AL, twice
Oh my gosh, not the way he says Biloxi
For Atlanta, that traffic was moving at a pretty solid clip.
Bro I live in PCB and friends/family work at Pier Park, sucks that none of us saw you 😭 lmao  Then again, there are millions of people here all summer, so can't say it's surprising
Hey guys, I've never seen Eddy's videos. Where the fuck have I been
So next is the Hard Rock Cafe right?
I was excited to see how Atlanta treated you. As a local, I feel vindicated knowing you hated it as much as I do and your biggest take away was how horrible the traffic is.
Oh my gosh the enthusiasm switched… Ted is DONE with this sh*t…
great now do hard rock cafe
I would recommend lamberts cafe for the next place but I think there's only 3 of those left.
A Nakey Jakey cameo? What a trip.
As a Canadian, I love that the Canadian locations of these random chains continue to slap hardest
Syracuse NY is agreed. Anyone from Syracuse NY would also agree. Lmfao. Love that you came out though pretty cool!
Do it with McDonald’s
As an unironic Jimmy fan, I love Margaritaville restaurants
DO BUBBA GUMPS NEXTTTT!!! THERE’S 22 OF THEM
It’s biluxi, not biloxi
forgot the one on Lake Conroe Texas 😅
WAIT JAKEY
ATL gang coming in with a W
Did he just say Biloxi? Hun you say it with a u, Biluxi
Every dicks last resort
Hard Rock Cafe when?
hey you didn’t have to do this twice it’s okay
Bo-LOX-ee. I love you, but as someone from Mississippi, I legitimately screamed when I heard you say it like that
It’s like Eddys personality is Teds personality in the rainforest cafe video
I can't wait for next year when they go to every hard rock cafe in America
I just spent 3 days at the Orlando parks with my cousins from Italy and are very last ride was Cat in the Hat
The list in incomplete, there is another on Lake Conroe in Texas.
Mad lad did it
Can you taste your mustache
this should win the oscar for best documentary
TIM👏MISNY👏HE👏MAKES👏THEM👏PAY👏
Now do every McDonald's
It's funny you went to New Orleans but skipped over the Margaritaville Resort thats in Shreveport, Louisiana.
The suspicious look on Ted's face is all i need to see to know that he did 911. And to think, all these years people blamed MewtwoKing for it
You went to destin 😭😭
I am so happy you did this again
New subscriber just for this video. Bought a shirt. Now im planning to go to more margaritavilles, some how this ad worked really well
This gets recommended to me but I will never watch your videos.
I love how this video is just like an overall video sharing his trip and Teds video is just an absolute drug trip
When the animatronic teQuiLla started I lost it 😂😂😂
I just am waiting for them to go to all the Hard Rock Cafes now…
Great video. Can't believe you went back into a rainforest cafe. I do wish you would have shown more and order different foods.
Do fuddruckers next
Eddy you mad lad I never thought you do this nonsense again lol
What in the McElroy brothers
as someone who went to syracuse and unfortunately had a few events at that margaritaville, this is very accurate
I watched this while eating my leftovers from margaritaville lmao
Why do you insist on torturing yourself for our entertainment Eddy
you're a madman and i do not trust you even a little bit when you say you'll never do this again. you're doing this again next year and i'm horrified for your sake
Ok but now you guys gotta go on a Margaritaville cruise to really do Jimmy proud
There is a Bubba Gump right next to the Las Vegas Rainforest cafe. That is one of 23 Bubba Gump locations in the United States. You can do whatever you want with that information.
Tim Misny!
You should do this with the Hard Rock Cafe
“Hi! I’m Jimmy!” AHHHHHHHH  21:40
i spent a valentine's day in the early 2000's at the margaritaville on the las vegas strip with my dad, surrounded by accountants from the midwest getting wasted on a weekday. a volcano would erupt every hour, they'd sacrific a virgin (waitess in bikini) to it & it'd spit her out.  presumably the joke was that she wasn't a virgin? anyway then see got shot down a water slide and landed on a tank behind the bar. i thought about that today because i read that jimmy buffet is opening an experiential resort in times square and i wanna jump into a volcano.
Next year Hard Rock Cafe
"Fins up Jimmy!" Im dead
So, Hard Rock Cafe next year? Yes? There’s * only * 34 in the US plus 2 in Canada. You’d get to go visit BC not just Niagara Falls for once😁  Through a series of weird events I’ve been to one in Finland and it was very trippy.
Oh Eddy you’re at it again
Now do Waffle House
wait till they hear about cafe rock
Was so cool to see you in PCB, my hometown <3 Sorry you had to eat at Margaritaville and not one of our wonderful local spots.
These restaurant quests are our generation’s National Lampoon Vacation
The Thing is the most important part of the Arizona experience, oh yeah and the Grand Canyon I guess
The almost sad thing about this is that the new generation has fewer drinkers despite rising alcohol consumption, meaning the drinkers left are consuming more and more volume, both of which are detrimental to the Margaritaville sales model.
I can’t wait for season three where you eat at every McDonald’s in America
cool story bro now go to every Applebees
you guys didn't go to Sandusky ohios Margaritaville
I would LOVE to be in the Margaritaville Board Meeting watching them discuss this video
Ted getting more and more joyous with each margaritaville is so fuckingfunny luyfkufulki
Would love to see a "visiting regional fast food" road trip. In n out, whataburger, culvers, cookout, runza etc
You absolute bastard I love you
Can’t wait for y’all to go do every Bubba Gump in America and Canada
This journey isn’t complete until you two go on the Margaritaville Cruise
19:00 I have an LG TV similar, its a problem with LG TVs that they loose a color coating on the backlight LEDs and turn blue.
You’re out here living my dream goal bro
Everything in this video from the food to the roads, hotels and resorts makes up the most insane ride of american consumerism I have ever seen. Nothing from Margaritaville is in the bible
San Antonio is itself just a giant puddle
thank you for the video, Deep Eddy
Next time you guys should roadtrip in Europe
This is my barbienhimer.
this is what i live for
What If? Some guy built a whole industry and lifestyle around a sugary drink? A nice, harmless (almost) cult.
Ok I’m from Florida and as much as I get that we’re used to random downpours and just having to drive through them because your already driving but it’s still sketchy. There have been multiple times where I was driving where I genuinely feared that I was going to crash.
I have to say, I understand why Eddy didn't play Jimmy's music during the vid (not wanting copyright claims and all that) but I really think that it would have added to the effect to see him and Ted losing their minds while Jimmy sings about his favorite cheeseburger toppings in the background
Do bubba gump shrimp next
Ok hear me out…ROUND 3…every Senior Frogs left in the US
i never heard of this place either I wonder if there new there 50:33
20:24 Accurate, this whole Florida section though is making me feel guilty for taking my home for granted. Ya'll getting excited about dolphins while I can see dolphins from the windows at work most days lol!
i have an important ? did you drive thro a city called Winona in Minnesota
i been in mall of America many times I never seen or heard of Margaritaville
Do McDonalds next year.
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
You know we're now just waiting for the next kitsch-themed restaurant video right? It's a trilogy now....
Seeing Pier Park in a video is so fuckin' weird because i go there like once a week
Been to one margaritaville. That was enough.  Eddy, you bro.
How about every hard rock cafe next year?
There's a Margaritaville just North of Houston you didn't go to. I feel betrayed.
16:25 it's the sound of Jimmy Buffet consuming his sacrifice
So,  Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, next?
Did I just watch (and enjoy) two video about Margaritaville, which I didn't know was a thing? Yes!
Yall missed one in Gaitlinburg TN!
you gotta do cheesecake factory
Pleaseee go to every soggy bottom general store🧌
He is the IRL achievement hunter
now do hard rock cafe !
You're such a brilliant storyteller dude.
I really loved this video, the only thing it was missing was a bit out a debrief like x was the best margitaville and y was the worst. The best dish was x and the worst dish was y.
As a man that’s been to destiny USA multiple times, I feel you about it being the worst but it is the 9th largest mall in the US
Guys really doing gods work.
They missed the one in Missouri lol
So when are you both doing Hard Rich Cafe?
@14:00 dude is in his uniform
"The day you have self reflections is the day you have diarrhea?!" 😂
But did you abandon your friend on the way?
Jakey is like a YouTuber cryptid, showing up in the background of other people’s videos but no real evidence that he exists (I love him but his upload schedule is bonkers anyway go stream Tommy Hanks)
Imagine being so privileged you have to fabricate your own struggle.
Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville is the closest thing we have to Dave Land.
I fear this man
17$ for that chicken sandwich!!!!!!
I love that the So-Fi sponsored segment showed up while he was in Florida, and that's the only state which can't sign up for So-Fi.
So where you going next year?
I am so glad my home town of syracuse, has the worst margaritaville lmao this town is terrible
What an adventure! I need a Margherita
Just some of the best stuff on YouTube right now
i've been to pigeon forge 6492739 time with my southern family (literally almost every vacation we've ever taken is there or to destin florida) and i clicked on this video solely to see that margaritaville. i've never been old enough to go inside😭
Ive been to the one in Destiny USA as I live about an hour away, its overpriced trash. Went once and never went back. So many better options in that mall.
What a friggin' coincidence that guy would see you all a year later. My uncle had two kids, one while in the military that he did not know of, and one when he came back and got married. They both have the same name, and go by the same nickname. Crazy, huh?
Every north American hard rock Cafe road trip coming in '24!
next. hard rock cafe
MARGARITAVILLE BABY
Destin is definitely nicer but I ate a girls ass in the pcb margaritaville and I think that really shows the difference of the two cities.   Oh and floridians cant handle the rain. They talk a big game until they're actually driving and it's raining. They're the worst.
Visit every Outback Steakhouse
I live laugh love the thing (u should have read the walls, it would have made more sense 🙄) I went to the Thing for my birthday and had all my friends dress up professionally it was great
31:35 the way she was holding that fork annoyed me way more than it should have.
Do you know how fucking VALIDATING it is to hear you explain and S H OW how god awfully terrifying the Cat and the Hat ride is. Growing up in orlando, that entire park section is frankly what traumatized me towards Dr. Suess in general. Terrifying
Looking forward to "eating at every MCDONALDS in the country"
"I fear that last night, I Jimmy'd a little too close to the sun" LOL
My dream trip would be visiting every single Cracker Barrel. You get your meal and your toys and your snacks at the same place.
time to go to every Mcdonalds next i think
There's one more trip, Eddie. 2024 demands the Bubba Gump Shrimp road trip.
Your're weak not knowing the full possess. How your journalist skills failed is not understanding upon food processing machines just like the workers,
yall really has your dessert before your dinner by going to the scenic marrgaritavilles first
Now go to every McDonalds
These are my type of road trips, pointless purpose but always fun
Love this video you just don’t get this kind of stuff in the UK so it’s really interesting to see 🎉😂❤
Come to every Wetherspoons in the UK
Eddy, no.
RIP to Eddy and Ted's livers after that many margarita's
very funny how once again, the best restaurant is the canadian one
Dropping a 911 joke and IMMEDIATELY afterwards meeting up wth Schlatt is just peak comedy.
Please do another one on another chain of restaurants next year. XD
Buba Gump next?
why are you doing this to you're self Eddy
RIP Thick44
That hat makes you look like a high ranking member of a Colombian cocaine cartel. Edit: The first hat I mean, you definitely should have bought that one instead of the second one, which makes you look like one of the people who works in the Bolivian jungle processing cocaine for slave wages.
Hearing you pronounce “Biloxi,MS” was a special moment
This was better than Rainforest Cafe
Great job!……       Do it again…..    Go to another restaurant.       Fucking do it again.
Do mc donalds next
They're so in sync, they even had the same sponsor. 😄
How did I not know Justin beibers baby was filmed at city walk
there’s a margaritaville in the detroit airport don’t know if that counts
Coming from Ted's videos the energies are two exact opposites lmao, I love it
So what restaurant are they doing to cap off the trilogy next year. My money's on bubba gump shrimp
Well..did you find that lost shaker of salt?
You're a madman. I respect that
He should eat at every Bubba Gump shrimp next
You guys should do Bubba gumps shrimp next year
The one thing this tour or 9000 miles of the USA has shown me is that I am deeply glad I am not an american and that I will refuse to ever visit.
Ok next video idea, pick a zoo, go to every single one. May I recommend rolling hills.
You can tell these guys are american because they choose an uncovered, oversized pickup truck to do a roadtrip in, instead of, say, a comfortable car.
Literally every single time you showed yourself glowing in the coloured LED I was thinking of that ‘you look lonely … I can fix that’ meme. So thanks for that 😂
You say this is the last time... But this is now a yearly eddy tradition
Why you didn't just order a different item on each visit? The would help with the monotony of the menu.
14:55 ayo They had a stinky feet at the arcade I was at last!! That's awesome lmao, I remember being so confused when I saw it. Wash those nasty grippers
THOSE WERE NOT DOLPHINS THOSE WERE ORCAS (you can tell by how curved and round there fins are)
why
You didn’t go the the Margaritaville bar in Tulsa, it is at a water park..... shout out to everybody from Tulsa...
The worst part of this video is when you ate at Pier park in Panama City, not for anything that you did just because my ex girlfriend lives down there and I still miss her. I can’t escape things reminding me of her even on fucking YouTube lmao
Can you do Houston’s restaurant? The food is actually really good, and there aren’t that many locations nationwide!
Next year go to every Outback Steakhouse
Oh Eddy not again surely.
Yeah syracuse is kinda, bleh, that mall is scary sometimes
go to every Applebees next 🤣
My brother you are henceforth known as General Eddie Hannibal Burback, conquerer of Margaritaville
Now go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country you fucking won’t Eddy
The one in Biloxi gives me nightmares. Stayed there in November last year for work. Alarm at 6:30am. 6am some guy is knocking on my room saying "room check." Wakes me up, I'm half asleep, dude opens the door, I say "what the hell" and he says "sorry" and leaves. Didn't see his face. I go down to the lobby pissed and scared and the lady behind the desk goes "yeah that happens sometimes." Like WHAT?! It shouldn't! I have to work, still rattled from the early stranger-in-my-room wakeup. Talk to the front desk people that afternoon and the situation was investigated and handled. Even offered to give me a new room. I was digging holes that day and broke my shovel. Put the handle in the room with me for some sense of protection. Now Margaritaville will always be tainted for me.
Jeddy Buffback.
I love jakey so much
I didn’t know I needed the second episode of the series, but did!!!
Could’ve just rented a SUV lmao
44:50 yea, its ass, thats why its always empty, everyone goes to better places in the mall
This video is just a lie lol. They went to some Margaritavilles...
I look forward to Eddy's margaritaville themed suicide note
I'm assuming the "piping" at the Pigeon Forge Margaritaville is to represent moonshine? Weird lol
eddy pronouncing biloxi like that hurt my non-native mississippi heart. also yes we do talk about jimmy buffet a LOT and i went to high school with his half-nephew, who got a job at that very margaritaville through nepotism and then got fired within 12 hours.
as a brit i have to say that you got absolutely mugged off with that fish and chips mate
Chanting until it happens: Bubba Gump Shrimp... Bubba Gump Shrimp... Bubba Gump Shrimp!
No sauce is criminal
Its not "bill-ox-ee", its "bill-uxee". Sincerely, a Mississippian who wants people to say our cities correctly.
dear eddy,  this is the first time i’ve seen your legs and that’s all i wanted to say. goodbye
you're not done. you know what you need to do. hard rock cafe.
Gotta make it a threequal and do Bubba Gump shrimp company next!
There’s a Margaritaville Cruise. It has similar food and drinks. I’d say, technically you need to go on it to be able to say you’ve been to all of them!!
You skipped out on the best item the volcano nachos
32:54 DAWG THIS IS NOT SYRACUSE, NY, OUR'S IS INSIDE THE MALL THATS STILL ALIVE LMAOOOOOOOOO
Did you learn nothing from your Rainforest Cafe road trip? 😂 My dude this is peak Masochism.
This just popped randomly and got to the Chicago part. That was fun coming from a Chicago native.
The way you pronounced Biloxi 😂😂😂
ted got stokholm syndrome
Huh Jambalaya that doesn't seem hot until you dig into it? Sound like it was cooked by Chef Mike.
Next year, you and Ted have to go to every Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza in  the United States and Canada
"the day you had self=reflection is the day you had diarrhea?!" LMAOO SUCH A FUNNY LINE OUT OF CONTEXT
Eddy, For next year’s adventure - There are still 34 Hard Rock Cafe’s left in the US. Just sayin..😅
The green screen pic had me hitting the subscribe button. The gospel music over it was an excellent choice
Time to go international ,Eddy. All 22 Hogs Breath Cafes in Australia.
conspiracy time: they only made one trip. They visited margaritaville and rainforest cafe at every location.
I’m sorry but the scene at the beach in key west for some reason reminded of the movie Weekend at Bernie’s hahahaha
the tulsa margaritaville is actually owned on the muskogee creek nation!
Glad ya enjoyed canada, eh?
The Thing signs are everywhere in Arizona
You just copied Ted's video 🙄 you even got that Eddy Burback guy to be in yours
ted nivision might not be happy
This would be an amazing series!
There are 34 Hardrock Cafes in the US. Seems reasonable to me. 2024 road trip?
BUBBA GUMP !!!!!! THE PEOPLES CHAMPION
lol
So... Flavortown next year?
Can't wait for I ate at every bubba gump shrimp in the country
Medevil times next 😂
You gotta do this again cuz there’s one opening up in South Lake Tahoe.
Hey, isn't there a Margaritaville in Hawaii?
Looking forward to next year when you guys do "I ate at every McDonalds in America"
??? Did you not go to the TWO Margaritavilles in Louisiana?
What's the song at 51:50???
Now you must go to every bubba gump shrimp restaurant in the country MUUHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
This will not be the final roadtrip
accidentally watched this movie length masterpiece about margaritaville, no regrets
Theirs more than 22 and their is one in bossier city Louisiana it’s a resort hotel. It’s got a boat themed tables and a giant sea plane with one of the biggest theaters in a hotel ever. They have a tiki bar on the roof.   Theirs also camp margaritaville locations and resorts in Mexico, Nassau, Dominican Republic, Cancun, and Costa Rica
Bro you hit The Thing at the wrong time it apparently used to be a sign to not tell anyone what the thing was and the joke is that there is no thing
Do Bubba Gump next
Two gays eating and drinking at margaritaville... what has the world come to
The location in Biloxi MS is great! Love taking my kids there! And kudos t o you for getting the fried catfish while here LOL
Niagara Falls always giving Eddy the best time fills me with pride for my country
Bubba Gump next year!
Hard Rock Cafe next 🫰
whats wrong with you
You guys should do Joe's Crab Shack next year.
Patiently waiting for every Bubba Gump in the US video...
comically large mustache.
Idk if yall would do one more tirp but what about all the hard rock cafes in the US? Thats a real challenge
The way you pronounced Biloxi...! Absolutely worth watching the rest of the video lol
Everyone saying Bubba Gump is missing the obvious next choice of medieval times
I clicked on the video thinking "I'll finally watch that video I keep seeing in my recommendations where the guy visits every rainforest cafe". Here i am, going to bed with it.
not a single link to the partner video…noob
Soooooooo hard rock cafe next year? 34 in the USA
First time. Good watch.
28:41 Chrissy: Eddy wake up! I don't like this! Eddy wake up!
44:50 on the bright side you weren’t stabbed/shot which can happen at that mall
cool do cheeseburger in paradise next
Dude, do a video on Wisconsin Dells!  Also, there a four international Rainforest Cafe locations that you haven’t visited.
I went to a margarita ville in Vegas on new years
Why is your suffering so fun to watch? You do great editing and make entertaining videos!
I've only been to the Margaritaville in Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, but unfortunately it closed in 2019. Would have loved to see you guys go to that one.
yet another masterpiece of a video
I mean it could be a trilogy with Bubba Gump shrimp
i live in syracuse, never been to the margaritaville there but it has always looked terrible. gokarts in the mall though, pretty sweet
i had my first legal alcoholic drink at a margaritaville in atlantic city nj :)
My parents took me to my first concert at the age of 9, it was Jimmy Buffet front row.. I had the pleasure of seeing him live 5 times and I am only 27.
ive eaten at the atlantic city one and the mrytle beach one.
It's bih-luxee btw. It's nice to know someone has come through MS and didn't hate it
can someone give me the timestamp for the one in myrtle beach sc
The Rainforest Cafe, now this. Eddy has sacrificed so much for us.
just kiss and make up
why?
Yass
Too bad u missed the one in Shreveport now u have to do it all over
now you have to go to every benihanas xD
you fucking skipped pensacola beach eddy
You were on my local radio station for this video
My first reaction before watching the video  Me: Who the hell is Jimmy Buffet and what the hell is a margaritaville
The margaritas are not even blended? .....lame
Now i know this is your last trip, but reconsider, Bubba Gump Shrimp Restaurant
i love how this series makes absolutely no sense and has no clear purpose but is still one of the best things on youtube
Warms my heart as a texan to see people point and laugh at bucees, I enjoy going there on every roadrip I take. I thought y'all would have gone to the location that just opened in South Padre Island. Maybe you'll have to plan another trip there to make it official...
Proud resident of a place devoid of rainforest cafe and margaritaville
America looks like a fun place.
pf changs next!!!!!!!!
oh hey eddy burbackstabber still exists
i refuse to believe that y’all aren’t gonna go for the Triple Crown & eat at every Hard Rock Café in the country (and Canada)
i wish you were alive when the cheeseburger in paradise restaurants were open 💔
Next year is gonna be Fuddruckers
Man, I grew up in south florida but had to move cause its too expensive now and seeing the footage of Key West made me miss it!!
46:33 🫵“I’ll make them pay”
Eddy are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay Eddy?
now go for a speedrun
Ate at a Jimmy in Florida and it took 2 hours just to eat. I've hated Jimmy since. Fuck Jimmy Buffet
Word of advice, do not eat the fish & chips at margaritaville
Can't wait to see what other themed restaurants you suffer in!
Is this the same dude that drove around the country eating at Rainforest Cafe a couple years ago?
Why did you skip the Margaritaville in Hollywood, Florida? Its between Miami and Orlando, and you would have passed in driving from Key West to Orlando.
So next year, Macaroni Grill? 40 locations. Macaroni road trip. Beep beep pasta.
Got to love watching a descent to chaos
Should watch Oppenheimer in all of those 19 theaters that show it as Nolan intended. Just for some hehe’s and possibly some hahas
53:08 WAIT I WAS THERE WTF 😢
Eddy, why would you do this to yourself
the roller coaster you took me through with this video was perfect for my first shroom trip. THank you
i DARE YOU to Bubba Gumps
This series must live on and Eddy sucumbs to his destiny of dying at a P.F. Changs.
Thank you for not saying in North America, because there are a bunch in the Caribbean and Mexico
The video I didnt know that I needed
Thats not even the original location for the rainforest cafe at the mall of america. It was originally located on the 1st floor
Y’all should do another one with every hard rock in the country
Eddy you have a nice head of hair may I have some.
“I think it might be tinnitus” 😭💀
Okay the alcohol doesn't seem that much from a Wisconsinite 🤣
Next up is Bubba Gump's right?
Omg Tim Misny what an icon
As someone from Florida, yeah, the rain fucking sucks here
when i was like 10, i went to my first concert. it was jimmy buffet.
whatever man
As a child of the parrot head cult, I'm glad you made it to the other side safe and with your logical reasoning intact. You're a brave man.
As a person who lives not far from PCB, it's just a beautiful beach in general. Been going there since I was like 5 so a quarter of a century and I still love making spur of the moment trips to PCB.
how about a waffle houses of the southeastern united states tour
why didn’t you go to the one in myrtle beach man
Ted's late bloom on the trip is easy to explain... his alcoholism kicked in and gave him a boost
Can we get some patreon exclusive/only fans content where you eat at every strip club breakfast buffet in the country, in homage to Parks n Rec?
As a born and raised Clevelander, you did not do Cleveland justice. That makes my tummy hurt
Please take the the margarita ville cruise next!!!!!!!!!!!
Please take the the margarita ville cruise next!!!!!!!!!!!
That Black Opal shirt was sick
Eddy My man why didn't you go to the palm springs location? As a local I am dying to know.
Wha… what could you even do next? What bizarre and nationwide restaurant could they even do next?
I think there are a couple Bubba Gump shrimp companies around the US... ya know, if you were curious
Bubba gumps next.
Also, do all the Applebees in Utah or some shit, that would be awesome
Gas station/convenience store dogs in small towns are the best
Literally 2 days ago I watched Good Mythical Morning's Margaritaville vs Bubba Gump video and thought "That Rainforest Cafe guy should go eat at Margaritavilles." and lo and behold he released this video the same day lol
Hear me out....Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
i think going to every single us bubba gump shrimp restaurant next would be good for you i think that would fix things eddy
You didn’t go to Lake Conroe
I'm from Panama City and I can legit say I've only eaten at the one in Pier Park once or twice. The salt shaker that comes out of the plane scares the shit out of you every time. Jimmy Buffet is also opening up a retirement community called Latitudes just north of PCB, so he is most def expanding the empire.   And thank you for calling my hometown beautiful!! We have the best beaches on the Gulf and you guys chose an absolutely amazing day to go, the water is so clear and calm! The little tiki boats you saw in Destin are booze cruises. It's basically a floating bar (a BARge, get it?) and PCB has some too. How those things don't capsize I will never know because they don't look safe at all.
Highly recommend dolly wood and also Dixie stampede such a great fucking time!!
The only other themed chain I think they could do, to make this a trilogy… Bubba Gump’s.
Next, you should fly to the UK & go to every Karen’s Diner in the UK.
it was so weird seeing eddy and ted at a margaritaville ive been to and go to place i visit yearly for family 😭 (biloxi)
What about the one in Shreveport LA?
This was a wild way for me to find out that the one in Hawaii closed
Went from every Rainforest Cafe to every Margaritaville.
I honestly think the next one should be Mellow Mushroom
There are 22 Bubba Gump shrimp companies in the US you know
i saw u at the oone in Montgomery
39:33 omg I have never laughed so hard in my entire life
This was beautiful. I know you said this is the last one but like…. what about Hard Rock Cafe???
“I’m in Florida, and I had a Margarita”
That Planet Hollywood shot near the end feels like foreshadowing tbh.
Oh good. I was worried they’d venture out of the hotel in Biloxi
When is there gonna be an OF for the uncensored feet vids?
Eddy I’m sorry to inform you…  But your missed the margaritaville on lake Lanier. It’s in the most AMAZING city of CUMMING GEORGIA !!
You've now doomed yourself to be "that guy" so, where y'all going next year?
The final trip? Think again, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company has 23 locations in the United States with 6 in California and Florida respectively. Plus another bonus trip to Canada with a location in Edmonton. Get to planning for summer 2k24.
Now do every McDonald’s. Have fun
Hey how much was hotel bills
are we not going to acknowledge the stinky feet song
i think the memories you made along the way are worth it and it wasnt a waste of time!
Bubba Gump shrimp next year??
This door is to remain unlocked during business hours -Jimmy Buffet
Looking forward to seeing every Hard Rock Cafe
This just seems like a religious expierence so far
You should go to all 63 Portillos half of which are in illinois
35:15 That.... that manager is the shit. certified fucking awesome.
next year you should do bubba gumps
Message me next year when they do every Medieval Times in America and Canada.
I remember when I watched the Rainforest Cafe vid it felt like last month… turns out it was just a year ago
I fell asleep while watching this and no shit I dreamt about staying in a Margaritaville resort but it was like falling apart, then I forgot about the dream until I clicked this video to pick up where I left off and had an immediate flashback to the dream. Amazing content. Amazing.
Next year is Hard Rock Cafe
those onion rings at the first restaurant were looking super rough. maybe that was the source of the tummy ache?
thank you for complementing our piss scented river walk :) i have lots of good river walk memories
One must imagine Eddy happy.
God I hope they do Bubba Gump Shrimp
It appears the resort/hotel locations have the best food, as they are expected to give the best hospitality, while the mall locations tend to be more "brand restaurant" in style. And the original in Key west looks like a beach bar lol
See the way he kept saying final road trip makes me think that it's going to be a yearly tradition where they'll go to the hard rock cafe or bubba Gump shrimp company, lol
also how dare u not like spencers they have great lava lamps, t-shirts and d***os what else could u ask for in a mall lmao
watching this video with a tummyache hits different. Good luck on your trip I watched 20 mins will watch the rest tommorow.
Almighty Eddy, please consider a 3rd trip visiting every medieval times in america
The thing about this video that gets me as opposed to the rainforest is that with the rainforest cafe, any employee hearing that they’re going to every single one In the country would be very surprised and/or intrigued but with margaritaville specifically I’m almost 100% sure this is not a rare occurrence
I can just imagine my bank calling me after the 12th margarita ville charge in a row on my card.
I can't believe you were less than half a mile away from where I live.
i was literally crying by the end
I’m getting sick of getting cocktail after cocktail…. So I got the peach in paradise 😂
Hard Rock Café
eddy, there are only 34 Hard Rock Cafes in the US…. 👀
Eddy getting to explore what the daily life of an alcoholic is like
I HATE to say it but… did they miss the Margaritaville in The Lake of the Ozarks (missouri)??
Did you go to Davin Busters
When I was 6 I rode that roller coaster (then called the pepsi ripsaw) 17 times in a row with my bestie and we both kept throwing up after because our little 6 year old bodies couldn't handle it but  we could not stop riding it. Something about the pepsi ripsaw is so special. So nostalgic. The old man animatronic in the cave part is my favorite (he was my boyfriend, my friend told me so when I was 6)
What about the one in Palm Springs?
What about margaritaville in Jacksonville FL? I stayed there after my chemo days at Mayo.
Eddy Butback forcing the margaritaville to stay open longer was kinda a dick move but he treated the employees well so I’m 50/50 about the situation
I swear to god I already watched this a year ago
Please keep doing insane Ted and Eddy road-trips once a year
The only thing left for yall to visit is Casa Bonita
I go to the margaritaville in pct and destin regularly
Whatever the next one is will kill one or both of them.
Gosh the bean is dirty
I’ll always remember the ifunny days and early YouTube days Eddy had and we talked. My favorite modern YouTuber hands down
The rainforest cafe San Antonio flashback was ✨gold✨
Do cracker barrel next❤❤❤
The road to key west is so beautiful but can be painful if there’s a lot of traffic like my family and I went recently and to go it took us a little under 4 hours but on the way back there was so much traffic it took us 8 hours to get back 😅
Eddy you didn’t have to have a margarita at every margaritaville
I love these videos, but I can’t imagine what other franchise they can do next
i hate to say this but… y’all missed a margaritaville
Bubba Gump Shrimp -> part 3
Saw the title and said out loud “my god he did it again”
Hey…so…what happened to Palm Springs Margaritaville?? 😢😢
God, i hate Jimmy Buffetts music so much. Ive been to one margaritaville and the wait was like 4 hrs, so hes doing something right.  Edit: Jimmy Buffett is worth 1 billion dollars, so clearly hes doing something right. I still think his music is terrible.
I really want your black opal shirt 😅
my guy was boozin it up every night lol
You gotta do it a third time. At Hard Rock Cafe. Pls Eddy
me waiting for the daytona beach location •_• i don’t blame you tho
what about the one in jacksonville? 😭
You are funny.
Eddy clearly eats a lot healthier than I do. I could easily chow down 30 burgers in a row without blinking.
The next trip is Bubba Gump Shrimp right?
"Rain is slippery and slippery is dangerous," I raise you snow and ice
Schlatt looks like the fisherman from jaws
So...are they going to up the ante and go to every hard rock cafe next?
Fun fact: The margaritaville in Syracuse is in the 6th largest mall in America
Now you should eat at  one cracker barrel in every state LOL. Love you video. Thanks for putting yourself through this twice
Ok bubba gump
hard rock cafe 2024
Fun fact- there's only 22 Bubba Gump shrimp locations in the U.S
13:29 Buc-ee does what with his what now-?
I love how Eddy was loosing his mind las time while Ted was having the time of his life and now was Eddy’s turn to be excited🤭
Honestly, I vote for this to become a yearly thing. You don’t have to go all out like this and destroy yourselves, but I enjoy the idea of us getting to ride along with you and check out cool new places after themes restaurants.
17:22 you didn't go to the Margrita theme park 🙁
Time to road trip the bubba gump shrimps!!!
Gatlinburg???
Eddy the story telling is so good. I don't know how you do it
Let me guess, Hard Rock Cafe is next? How exciting. Splendid video.
Now imagine how miserable they'd be if they went to every cracker barrel in the US (661 restaurants in 564 across 45 states)
Biloxi Mississippi?! This is _not_ a place I expected to come across someone visiting my birthplace... My parents moved elsewhere before I was old enough to form memories, so it's not like I have any real emotional ties to the place, but still... Not a town name that comes up particularly often.
Eddy is that one friend who’s tummy always hurts..😂😂
Go to every chilis
Reading the book out loud in the truck was clearly pay back for being dragged to the Rainforest cafe.
Just wait until Eddy finds out about the Deep Eddy distillery here in Austin on his next road trip.
You did this again cus Youtube paid you a shit ton the first time. As they should you're very entertaining. See you next year for the roadtrip to every Idont'tknowWhatTheFuck in North America.
Insert cyberpunk meme here 22:11
I just want to point out that there are 22 chapters on the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the US, 4 in Mexico,and 1 in Canada. No reason just a fun fact.
As someone who’s never seen you or any of your videos you held me for a 58 minute video this is top tier content Imma sub impressive sir jimmy would be proud 🫡
Ain't no way Edward shilling for a bank.
I feel sorry for this guy. Even McDonald’s has better food than Margaritaville
ted got Stockholm Syndrome lmfao
Eddy next summer every Cracker Barrel. There are only 660.
If y’all really hate yourselves you should every bubba shrimp locations it feels like it fits these vibes well
Watching this video before Ted’s is tonally  identical to watching Oppenheimer before Barbie
Notice how he left Florida and started having a bad time.
Eddy, please. As a fan in Mississippi, why you pronouncing Biloxi like that?😭
YOOOOOO I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD BRING UP CHRISSY'S SONG I FUCKING LOVE THAT SONG
i got so excited when you visited my margaritaville in myrtle beach but i have to tell you i don’t know anything about heroes harbor that place is called broadway on the beach!! AKA heaven to me as a seven year old. i treasure the memory of throwing fries off the margaritaville deck to fish in the water.
eating at every bubba gump shrimp co in the u.s. when
as someone from new orleans, please stay longer than one night on bourbon street! the city is more than our tourist trap french quarter
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp next. It’s probably shorter
Change things up, go to every Ripley's Believe it or Not museum in the US and Canada
Waiting until next year for “eating at every Señor Frog’s in North America & the Caribbean”
Truly a cinematic masterpiece
Hard Rock Cafe next?
I can’t believe Eddy never brought up the line “What would Jimmy Buffett do?” from the Alan Jackson song “5 o’clock Somewhere”  It fits too well, too perfect
But what about margaritaville lake Conroe in Texas?
Do bubba Gino shrimp
I think you guys need to go to the 10 medieval times across the country now...
Technically you didn't go to every Margaritaville in the country because you didn't go to the one on the Big Island of Hawaii.
Oh y’all have to do the Hard Rock Cafe next year (sorry eddy but congrats to Ted)
This video gave me heart burn.
next time yall come to Minnesota I need to pull up to mall of america
Just checked the menu on yelp, and……….. I might go to margaritaville
Man Jimmy Carter is such a cool guy
What’s next year? Bubba gumbo shrimp?
My first concert ever was a Jimmy buffet concert in like 2007 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough Ma. Saw my first pair of boobs there.  After my confirmation in 2011 we celebrated by going to the now defunct margaritaville in Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, CT. My first meal as a man in the eyes of god was at a margaritaville.   This video is a spiritual experience for ne  This
51:16 coping mechanisms are weird man.
I barely watched the video but you have a baller mustache
What about Bossier City, LA?
The way you said “Biloxi” made me physically cringe, but I AM glad you kind of had fun in the worst state in the US 😅 Thanks for your service, Eddie!
46:32 A WILD TIM MISNY APPEARS  (If you’re from Northeast Ohio, you know)
Canada just does it better tbh
Pigeon Forge is a tourist trap hell hole. We went to the Dollywood waterpark and our feet were on fire.
Do Hard Rock next year
How are you friend with drew and Danny? Must be so confusing
lol. Rain is slippery. Try snow and ice. Rain is great to drive on after that.
A part 2 hell yeah this is beautiful
There is a Margaritaville Cafe in the Miami Airport....can't help but notice you didn't stop theeereeee 👀
Anyone know the name of the song at the beginning, at like 1:30ish, during the intro? I can’t remember for the life of me.
Funny story… I was with a huge group of friends on a college service trip in San Antonio and we went to margaritaville for dinner. It was at that dinner that we all received an email at the exact same time that our college campus was shutting down due to Covid and we wouldn’t be allowed to go back. It was very strange 😂😂😂😂
Do Every Mcdonald next please.
cant wait for the bubba gump shrimp tour
As a Floridian, I am sorry.
Hey eddy. Hard rock Cafe next.....34 locations
Loved it! Better than the last. Only thing I would like to point out though is you mentioned to the internet about your discomfort around Buc-ee. I think we both know what part 3 will be about next year.  "Hey!! Fresh brisket on the board!"
48:23   New Weezer Album dropped.
Shameful to lie, skipping the Palm Springs Margaritaville Resort in California.
cool, cool. now do all Bubba Gump's.
Every Hard Rock Cafe in the world next summer?
I feel so honored knowing Eddy came back to Florida to bless us with his presence, truly a highlight for the state, Jimmy Buffet would be proud
What the fuck did Ted do to kill that Tacoma.
doesn't feel too good watching someone live out dreams
The next ones going to be every shrimp bubba gump. Calling it right now
I nominate doing all the Bubba Gumps next year
Do chili's next 😂
*compares the Margaritaville location map to the Rainforest Cafe one*   Man, the two themed restaurants abandoned the West Coast fairly quickly, huh? And not a single presence in Oregon or Washington!
Guess the only thing left to do is eat at every Bubba Gump.......
58:11 nah i can say that
Do a mini-version with hard rock cafes! 😂😂
Hard Rock Cafe next???
Bad call to order jambalaya in Minnesota. It's strongest spice is Katchup.
this is today’s super size me. innovative. ground breaking. revolutionary. ya. hoo.
Man, I sat at that same boat table in February. We had a dinner at  that Margaritaville for a conference, and all the folks who never get to see live music were impressed and enjoyed the band that played that night.
Margaritaville is not a location. Margaritaville is a state of mind.
I'm so excited to make European friends so I can bring them to the theatrical capitalistic center of the world!
BEANBEANBEANBEANBEANBEANBEANBEANBEAN!!!
Now you’ve done this twice you have to have it a trilogy!
I cant wait for you and Ted to visit every Cheesecake Factory next year
IT'S BIH-LUX-EE
not a so many at times you can see the spaces 42:42
if you do another restaurant it'll be more impressive
"Then we got stuck in traffic" yeah well that's atlanta for ya
Cant wait for the nation wide (and Canada) tour of Hard Rock Cafe next year , upping the ante with even more restaurants 🎉
When he said I Jimmy'd too close to the sun that was so sad
oh no...lol
Idk why I thought there was gonna be like 100 of them 😂😂😂
jimmy buffett flew on epsteins planes
When they said they were headed to the Atlanta one my first thought was “how the fuck they gonna make it through metro Atlanta traffic for dinner” call me a psychic or call the infrastructure of the city of Atlanta notorious shit
jimmy buffett flew on epsteins planes
Can't wait for that video of going to every single Buc-ee's location ;)
I was hoping Eddy would’ve come to Montgomery, TX because there’s a Margaritaville resort on the lake. But I guess there isn’t a “Margaritaville Restaurant” there.
So what’s your next adventure? I need more!
First thought when I saw the thumbnail: oh god, they've done it again. I can't wait to see who breaks down this time
I can only hope that the next series will be Bubba Gump
cant wait for you to do bubba gumps next
Being from the Midwest, 8-9 hours? You mean like a day trip somewhere?
I haven’t finished the video but I really hope he mentions that Margaritaville was also turned into a musical
Midway through this video Eddie started to consider the most important thing. WWJD? (What Would Jimmy Do?)  Edit: I made this comment before Eddie made the joke
This poor man better get a sponsorship with Better Help 😆
Ok, Do every Hard Rock Cafe next year.
hey eddy i walked into my straight societal conforming brothers room and he was watching this video lacking any knowledge of who you are. congrats on hitting the algorithm !
I suggest that next year you guys go to every Voodoo Doughnuts location.
Ted’s video is better haha
How about every panda express
You can also do all 34 hard rock cafes in the states! Like this so he sees it!
Bubba gump shrimp next
you'll never convince me you didnt shit yourself at least once
Ok ok ok so the video was great and the rainforest part had me rolling but who was the cutie sitting next to him at the first Margaritaville
Eddy and Ted visited the Key West location at the right time. The Summer isn’t the tourist season, the Winter is, which is why it felt so local. It was also so surreal watching them drive down highway 1 and Roosevelt Blvd
great sign when the ceiling is practically falling out 22:43
“Second and final time”, Eddy, we all know you’re lying to us and yourself when you say final. Because you’ve always got Cracker Barrel
Nah, there is no way America is real
Hear me out if a budget allows,     All hard rock cafes
honestly i been and seen worse then this 20:18
40 hours in 8 days is so little driving… I make it across the us from Ohio to California in 36 hours…
I can’t wait until next summer
Next year do every Hard Rock Cafe
i been to a bigger one and it ain't buc ees it felt like a mall 12:55
You guys just missed going to the Pensacola Margaritaville! It changed at the beginning of June, it's now the Pensacola Beach Resort. I'm glad you enjoyed your visit to the Gulf Coast though! We do have some lovely beaches here
[…]- Directed by David Lynch
not the blade runner 2049 reference
Buffalo poutine form margaritaville actually sounds bomb, and I’m actually Canadian. My favourite restaurant used to make it but they changed the menu and it wasn’t the same afterwards🥲
Hard Rock Cafe next 😝
You guys missed one in Georgia at Lanier Islands btw. Its a lake that used to be a town so that pretty cool.
Next year eat at every McDonald’s in the country
next go to every mcdonalds
Next year… every McDonald’s in America .
the final ?🤔
the ending was so heartwarming :,)
Yall missed one in Conroe Texas
Lmao I can't say I'm shocked you weren't thrilled with the Syracuse one. (I live in the area). It's a...well, the restaurant is basically slapped in there because it's a big name chain restaurant. Destiny USA was a huge Robert Congel project that started when I was a kid. It was supposed to be bigger than the Mall of America (didn't quite get there). I still call it by its old name (the Carousel Mall), because I'm stubborn af like that.
DONT YOU EVER DISRESPECT THE WHO HASH
Eddy... We all know you're going to all 22 Bubba Gump Shrimps next year.
He missed a Margaritaville
I saw your rainforest cafe video so I did not think that. I just thought, who did Eddie bully this time.
Next up, eat at every McDonald’s in the US and Canada
Jimmy Buffet is the worst.
you're funny, and you come up with really good jokes and shit in these videos, but the overall content of going to fkn margaritaville or rainforest cafe is not cool. Glad it's the last. I only clicked on this cuz it bothered me so much to keep seeing it on my algorithm. Also you look way too much like Jenna Marbles' boyfriend and half the time I click on you when I think it's Julien.
Tulsa ok baby!
Im confused, theres more Margaritaville's than this. You didnt go to all of them @EddyBurback
Ted was going insane
why are you friends with a racist eddy
Can’t wait for the “eating at every McDonalds “ episode!
Here is an easier one for you next year: go to every currently operational K-Mart.
I think there is a resort in Bossier City. Louisiana
Stop it. Get some help.
Watching Ted and eddys videos on these trips is like seeing alternate perspectives of clover field
Now waiting on “I ate at every margaritaville in the world”
I’m surprised neither of y’all mentioned parrot heads
“I ate at every Medieval Times in the country” coming next year…
RIP to the Margaritaville in Padre Island
just liked cause I respect the grind
when u mentioned the dells i got so happy :) love to know people i watch enjoyed the same things i did as a kid (also when ppl mention wisconsin im like :0)
Omg, can you please do the Hard Rock Cafés next!!!!🎉
I love seeing your adventures with Ted. We graduated together and I had no clue he existed but he’s a pretty cool dude, almost as cool as you, and almost as cool as J.B. ❤️
"I beat the kid" -Eddy Burback
the way he pronounces biloxi is so funny to me
Please tell me Medieval Times is next on your list 🤞🏽
…go for a three-peat and hit every Bubba Gump Shrimp
Damn it this better be an annual event from now on. Where could he go next year?
Well some people claim that there’s a woman to blame, but I it’s Eddies own damn fault.
The only one I've been to is the Niagra one, and it was honestly so delicious. I'm surprised and sad to hear the others aren't as good
I think eating at every Dick's Last Resort would be manageable for you guys.  You wouldn't even need to cross the border.  I know Bubba Gump Shrimp is getting popular, but there's two locations in Mexico (one on the Yucatan Peninsula), and the only Canadian spot is in Edmonton.  That's... very difficult via car.
D&B or bust
"the day you had self reflection was the day you had diaherria?" killed me im sorry please do this again next year it was fun seeing you two slowly go insane
The greatest example of the indomitable human spirit
Does he go to the one in Atlanta??
Please tell me BubbaGump is next
I have no idea what Margharitaville is as a Dutch person but I will absolutely watch this
9:25 why is he using a pistol belt as a garand sling
Nobody has eaten in every margaritaville twice
I always thought that the plural was Margaritasville, like Attorneys General
I will not tolerate Buccee's slander.
You miss the second one in Miami! There is two of them. I wish you went to the other one it would be by far the worst one I’m sure of it 😂
Every starbucks next!!
I think these videos have done irreparable damage to Eddie's mind, body and soul
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF AND/OR WHERE I CAN BUY PICTURES OF EDDYS FEET?????
As an Orlando local who’s drank loads of times at universal i just learned that was his plane, thank you!
I have no idea who Jimmy Buffet is, but now I know, he owned restaurants called margaritaville
Bubba Gump next year please?  These videos are gold! 😂
Sorry to disappoint but Deep Eddy vodka is disgusting
Now just imagine if Cheeseburger in Paradise was still operational...
Thank you so much for this. This series kills me. Also I had no idea Jimmy Buffet owned these restaurants Lmao. Y’all are wildly entertaining!
Next year needs to Dicks Last Resort!
So when’s the Cracker Barrel run?
The Atlanta Margartitaville with the southern hospitality 😂
As a local from where Jimmy buffet is from it’s weird seeing a margaritaville where my family and I live lol
Do every sonic next
i went to margaritaville for my graduation dinner. the live band played harry styles and my dad hated the food and still brings it up to rag on me but they gave me a free dessert
Can we get a sequel where you eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
What about the Margaritaville in Hawaii?
Great so when’s Hard Rock Cafe?
This channel is slowly becoming the worst travel blog in the world
Oh, noooo! Jacksonville Beach, FL is missing!
The strange thing about bucees is they all have the same layout. I was trying to figure out which one you were in but i genuinely couldnt tell
You should go to every Cheesecake Factory now
So when are you planning on doing bubba gump? There’s also one in the mall of america
*Pounds fist on desk* "I want pictures of eddy's feet dammit!"
My fiancé really wanted to go to the margaritaville in Chicago a couple years ago for his birthday, but the wait they said was half and hour but ended up being more than an hour. We ended up eating at the McDonalds because we had to catch the train back home, but looks like we probably had the better meal 😂
This is like torture. I've never been to a margaritaville that I haven't absolutely hated every single one of them that I've been to have been overpriced and terrible
Why didn't you go to the Margaritaville in Osage Beach, Missouri?
This means you’ve been to Panama City Florida, you poor thing
Did you know that there was once a Margaritaville in Newark Delaware?  I’m so sad it closed because the idea of you being trapped in Delaware once again tickles my little Delawarian heart
You should do every McDonald's in America next
hey now ican say that ive been in the same locations as eddy and ted
This series is going to end in Eddie  either marrying or killing  Ted. There is no in between lol
can't wait for yall to plan an olive garden trip
As a daughter of two of the biggest parrot heads to ever live I gotta say, it’s such a cult
I went to Florida with my Mom and her crazy cousin once when I was like 10 and we drove from Orlando to the keys it takes a couple hours. They insisted on only listening to Jimmy Buffet the whole trip and by the end I was ready to go to the Cheese burger in paradise by my own hand. I still hold a special hatred in my heart for Jimmy but I do hope he finds his lost salt shaker or whatever.
What a shame this is the last time they go around the country...  Next year you should go to every McDonalds
Trying every food at bucees!! 13:34
Wait until eddy finds out about hogs breathe in Australia
@defunctland please make a video about the Cat in the Hat dark ride
i lay awake in fear that he’ll one day go to every bubba gumps location
Eddy Nine Pins does it again!
I know every Ohioan saw that Tim Misny billboard and shot up out of their seats
I've been to both the Tulsa and Orlando margaritavilles the Orlando one doesn't have good cheese curds, but the Tulsa one has decent cheese quesadillas
This is a terrible series idea, but I am going to watch it and none of your other videos so that you can't help but to continue it.
so ready for the hard rock cafe next year
I adore the consistent horror eddy feels everytime he even sees a rainforest cafe restaurant
I missed your sassy little mustachiod face, kiddo. Glad I found your channel again.
I’ve only been to two Margaritavilles. The one at Universal Studios and the one in the Florida Keys.
@michelleb1952 7 minutes ago I mean the next logical step is a Bubba Gumps 2024 trip...
patiently waiting for the 2024 'I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country' video
Nice bean cameo
I don't know how you two haven't fallen in love or killed each other yet
I came for the rainforest Cafe video, I stayed for this one.   This is legendary dude. Congratulations.
I cant wait for this series to devolve in soemthing so manic like Every Mcdonalds in the US
If Colorado had either a Rainforest Cafe or MagaritaVille then I could've kept them in business.
Do Bubba gumps next
You are much stronger than me to be able to do all this
Bro missed the lake of the ozarks margaritaville, L video 😤
my favorite internet couple
So what's next? Bubba Gumps?
The green m&m is giving me bladerunner vibes
Next do every McDonalds in the US and Canada
Ok I really thought I was just continuing the rainforest cafe video.
Loved the Rainforest Cafe PTSD moments. And the blurred toes. And your moustache. Just great stuff all around, Eddy.  Why no Palm Springs, Margaritaville, Eddy? Whyyyyy? Bc it sucks, thats why.
Go to every McDonald’s in America next year
if u go to every bubba gump shrimp co next year i will be very happy
This has got to be so mind numbing and something I’d never do but boy do I enjoy watching you subject yourself to it 😂
Eddy why do you not stream on twitch or play video games anymore :/
Now hear me out, 2024, you and Ted visit every Medieval Times in America and Canada.
Where is the Margaritaville in Jacksonville??
Walked past the Pigeon Forge one on vacation this year. But we ate at Dicks instead so it doesn't count.
in from australia i want to go to margarita ville right now cuuunt
18 dollars for a grilled chicken sandwich?!
Ok so, have you heard of bubba gump shrimp
Take me to one Margaritaville, I'll open my legs. . .
Next, hit every McDonalds across the globe.
11:45 Kinda disappointed he didn’t say just chattin’ and schlattin’
bubba gump next
Um Sir there is a Margarita Vile in Puerto Rico and Saint Thomas which are technically the US...sooooo you have 2 more....technically....
How about every subway in North America?
I saw Avengers infinity war and endgame in destiny USA. So… pretty historical
I lived in Panama City for 15 years, and while perhaps some of the reputation of Panama City Beach might be deserved, it was nice to see a positive take. It's not a bad place overall. Pier Park isn't huge, but it is a nice place to have for locals and tourists.
do mcdonald's next
"My tummy hurts"  *proceeds to drink a margarita everyday and only get cheeseburgers, chicken, and fried shit*   Eddy is not good at this
30:24 brings back nostalgic horror thank you for experiencing what I and my friends once did and will occasionally go back to.
Can't wait for matpat to make a video about the "lore" of margaritaville
Every Bubba Gump in America 2024
hahaha im not at all surprised the food was terrible at the syracuse location
This was phenomenal.... I must say, you stopped in New Orleans and if it had been just a few years earlier you could have stopped at the Margaritaville that's there as well. I know because I had my wedding reception there before it went out of business. I'm also getting a divorce now so that kinda tells you how swell of an idea that was but still 🤷🏻‍♂️
Where is everyone? 😂
You like margaritaville, don’t you squidward?
All the MEDIEVAL TIMES!!!!!!!
You won't go to every Applebee's in the country. No one could stomach that...
Finale, every Hard Rock Cafe….. in the world!
Watching Kyle's cousin Kyle eat at chain restaurants over and over again is my new favorite pastime
Lol i could imagine GMs getting calling from DMs and corporate about some of the poor experiences. Like that dry rock shrimp. Yikes  On the flip side. So much to take away from this video lol
You guys missed a Margaritaville in Georgia. There’s one at the lake in Georgia and they even have a camping ground.
Nakeyjakey sighting, say less
These capture a little top gear travel episode and I love it
Do medieval times next
Can't wait for next years wild trip lol
Coming Summer 2024: "I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the Country"
bucceez nuts
I went to the one in Orlando at universal and ordered the fried chicken, it was really good but I don't think I could eat at that restaurant this often
YOU WERE IN MY TOWN?!
Now eat at every McDonald's
go to every mcdonald's, you'll be on a lifelong tour
Might I recommend Medieval Times for your next cross country trip? I absolutely love these videos Eddy! 😊😊
Eddy goes to every waffle house
you should do the 34 hard rock cafe in the us
Eddy: “Yeah eating all at all the Margaritavilles with their variable quality food is destroying my stomach”  Also Eddy: *Multiple nights of tons of alcohol in the span of several weeks”
According to my mother Miami International Airport has a margaritavill. If true this invalidates the challenge 👀😅
Go to every bubba gump shrimp in America
54:54 Hakone 86
Sadly you just missed the opening Margariitaville RV resort in Louisiana.
I got so excited when you mentioned Boston only to realize they haven't built Margaritaville in Boston yet.
There used to be one in Connecticut
roasts Binkly right into the welcoming of Schlatt scene lmao
How on earth have you gotten me to watch this kind of content not once but twice and thoroughly enjoy it each time? Do it again.
Missed probably the best Margaritaville in the US which is on St. Thomas
How is the top comment not about the mispronounciation of Biloxi
Did the Orlando resort not have a restaurant in it? Also why was Crissy in Florida only? Also chops to the Atlanta Margaritaville staff.
1 year from now, "I went to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US"
I think next year you guys should do all the Medieval Times is the US or all of the Hard Rock Cafes or all the Cracker Barrel’s!!!!
i like how eddy liked the food best in niagara falls, canada in both this and the rainforest cafe video LOL
A year already?
You know what restaurant you should do next: bubba gumps
There's a margaritaville in my city in Louisiana and I've never eaten there. I just go for easy roulette wins.
I love you eddy
Next up: I ate at every McDonald's in the country
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s next!
idk why its so shocking to me to see the city im pretty much from in your video LOL
Hate to break it to you but you definitely missed a Margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach
ok but that random passerby yelling coolest mofos on the planet in response to him and his bro leaning against the wall is the most chicago thing ive ever seen lmao
Deep eddy vodka is from Austin, named after the pool
Eddy missed getting to witness the hurricane warning at the Myrtle Beach location. The tall blender fills up with Margaritaville mixer and the song also plays. It’s quite magical…. Until you’re there for soo long it happens multiple times
when he was like i’m gonna go into spencer’s i was like, pls do not fill in there
Now do bubba gump shrimp you coward
It's 5 o'clock somewhere baby
Dear God.
Okay good now do every McDonald’s
🤣 🤣i think ted is losing it this time
As an Arizona native, I really appreciate your The Thing? side-trip.
As a resident of Biloxi, I gotta say thank you for visiting! But I also need to corrct by saying that the town's name is pronounced as "Buh-lux-ee," not as "Bah-lox-ee." I noticed you mentioned that everyone was talking about Jimmy and it seemed like a cult. We may be a little more fervent in our enthusiasm because Jimmy is FROM the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The beach in nearby Pascagoula was dedicated to him about a decade or so ago and he came down for the ceremony. He even has a song called The Pascagoula Run. Really enjoyed the video!
I haven't realized that the video is an hour long. It's 2AM.
What about every planet Hollywood?
Should’ve taken a detour to Gulf Shores, AL to stop by his wife’s restaurant, LuLu’s
Do the Margaritaville cruise next
THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
As a Florida man myself, I truly believe our nothern locations (specifically the Destin one not that bullshit in PCB) are easily the best
Pigeon Forge is the Myrtle Beach of the mountains.  Also I can't believe you did this again.
Next should be every McDonald's as a giant finale, it'd be a good 39hr video.
46:32 TIM MISNY LET'S GOOOOOOO
What about going to each state capitol and eating at some signature local restaurant there? You can do your part of making it interesting 🤔
Tacoma legend
Please do this as a series next. Would be so fun to follow along!
I feel like this should be called “Eddy and Ted become alcoholics for 24 days!”
i think u missed one in Hawaii
What if you visited every theme park (for example dollywood) in the us? ⭐
I feel bad, but who wants to tell him they missed the Margaritaville resort in Palm Springs…. 😬🫠
Can’t wait till Eddy does Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump’s Shrimp.
Being from Syracuse, was excited to see Destiny USA shit on. Sadly, there was not enough of it.
do dicks last resort or hooters next
Now do every hard rock cafe
Eddy you guys missed one! I live in Jacksonville beach and we have a margaritaville hotel and restaurant. Gotta do it all over again.
As someone who has seen The Thing, I can confirm that it's pretty awesome.
Are bubba gump restaurants next
I somewhat doubt that this will be Eddys last USA chain food tour.
glorious mustache
Go to every P.F. Chang’s
Next you guys need to eat at every Six Flags in America and Canada!
Seeing San Antonio in the video makes me homesick, Colorado doesn’t come close to even trying to compare
Eddy uses these videos for cunning tax evasion, guys hes a total fraud! #WhatsUnderTheStache?
I can't believe you didn't go on the Margaritaville at Sea cruise ship.
We gonna need Hard Rock Cafe next
If anyone would like to be a Saint and add time stamps for each city, thank you in advance 😂🎉
youre missing the new one at south padre island 😬
Dudes lying he didn’t go to the lake of the ozarks margaritaville
eddy: can't go to dollywood because we have no time for anything other than margaritaville on this trip  also eddy: goes to universal
So how many Hard Rock Cafes are there?
Watch as in 5 years, he makes a 3 hour long video of him going to every McDonald's in the US and Canada
Do all the hard rock cafes now
Watch he does this same shit next year with Hard Rock Cafe
Do this with Bubba Gump!
I cant believe you did another trip like the Rainforest Cafe trip.  Well played, Sir! Subscription earned!
The 20 nth day had me rolling on the floor.🤣
Three words for you:  Bubba. Gump. Shrimp.  This can't be the end. Make the pilgrimage.
Hate to break it but you definitely missed one lol , you gotta start over now
seeing eddy going to so many places ive been before makes me sad i didnt meet him there
When Misny was on the screen  I lost my mind
Ahhh shit here we go again
Forgot the one in Honolulu
See you next year for bubba gump
You can see the determination in his eyes
Things Eddy clearly loves:-Margaritavilles-Rain Forest Cafes-Morbius. Imagine if margaritaville had an All you can eat Jimmy Buffet.
please do hard rock cafe next year (take ur time tho to recover from this)
What about Lake of the Ozarks (Missouri) 😂 better hop jimmys puddle jumper and try it out
there is a margaritaville in capitola ca.... although I have now learned that it is unaffiliated with jimmy buffet's margaritavilles... and consequently i have learned that i have never been to a "real" margaritaville. watching this video also makes it clear that is ok with me. oh yah and there is a margaritaville resort in palm springs... but maybe that doesn't count for some reason... and there is also a margaritaville cruise ship............. so maybe a part two?
Ironically the only thing I’ve ever heard about this chain from people I know is its margaritas aren’t that good lol
54:56 las vegas is so grand! i remember when i went i stayed at the Aria the casino was huge
As an asian, I have never heard of Jimmy Buffett, I'm honestly impressed he got this far with his Hotel and Restaurant business, a lot of celebrities who have no previous culinary background usually fail, and fail hard with their restaurant business, Gordon be proud.
Truly wasting away again in margaritavillie.
Make it a trilogy.
Time for Benihana
He’ll have to do the trip again in an year after I’m done building a new margaritaville in Tahoe, CA
U are too negative for me sounds like fun too me
can't wait for another dumb food chain for next year, betting on Hard Rock Cafe or Bubba Gump
Legend has it Eddy is still looking for his lost shaker of salt
Now do a big road trip with both restaurants
What about the lake of the ozarks? not every Margaritaville :(
2:40 real ones know citywalk from south park
It’s so weird seeing my hometown of 5000 people show up as B-Roll footage of a guy driving cross country to eat at every Margaritaville
Eddy - you are strangely attractive and it confuses me.  But your better looking with the short fur.
lol he said biloxi wrong
Next years road trip: Every Bubba Gump  shrimp in the US
I've been to a few they aren't bad but the key west location feels the best
Next up: Texas Roadhouse? (Kidding, that would be impossible.)
Eddy’s pronunciations of Biloxi and Panama City Beach are really funny to me as a southerner
everytime i see those huge props in margaritaville and rainforest cafe i can only imagine how absolutely dusty they are
I'm probably related to Jimmy to some capacity. He was at a family reunion when my dad was a teanager.
So… Hard Rock Cafe next?
happy 40th birthday eddie!
Shout out to the "Hollywood Bad-boy"  stubble that didn't grow out for the entire roadtrip! There's always 5 o'clock shade on Jimmy's time.
The rainforest experience didn’t earn my sub but this margaritaville def earned a sub
At first, I thought Eddy was becoming an alcoholic  Little did I know it was all a part of the cult induction
40% of food borne illness comes from retail establishments. Considering you ate exclusively retail establishment food, I'm gonna go ahead and guess there was some improper handling of the food lol.
do bubba gump next
What's the song that plays around 26:30?
Don’t tell me in all this you totally bypassed the giant margaritaville resort at lake of the ozarks in Missouri??
damn we just closed our in Edmonton to bad. cant wait for you to do all the Bubba Gumps
They have the best nachos anywhere,
Do McDonalds next
As a guy who lives inbetween both Destin and Panama City, it’s wild that y’all managed to do both and kept rolling with it. Me and my buddies did the same and have not been to margaritaville since.
I need more of these
I've definitely been to a Margaritaville in Capitola, CA, unless it closed during the pandemic this video is built on lies! Lol.
Eat at every McDonalds in the country Summer 2024-2051
eddy when i went to universal i got stuck on the car in the hat ride for 30 minutes I understand your fear
Wait, where did you see the snake? S/he’s a cutie!
In the parrothead religion, this is a pilgrimage tantamount to going to mecca
Next year, you should try to eat at every Casa Bonita in the country.
This is top tier content.
Now do Cracker Barrel
Every medieval times in North America let’s go
Yeah that cat in the hat ride was just as terrifying as an adult as it was as a child the last time I went on it. It also made me incredibly nauseous
Looks like we got the answer to: " what if a meth head inherited a gas station?"
This was great Eddy!  I hate to say, but your next stop should be eating at every Bubba Gumps in the country
You can do this one more time. Next year, do Bubba Gump's
AIDS burger in paradise.
Can’t wait for the bubba gump episode!
Anybody know if the restaurant only plays Jimmy Buffet music?
Suggestion: Hardrock Cafe
Shoutout to the Belvidere Oasis 49:00 .  Favorite stop and shop up I-90 .
Eddy no one is asking you to make these self torture videos!          But keep them coming
37:04
I loved the Rainforest Cafe video, I love this one even more. So all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. locations in the US and Mexico next year?
I've had the best ginger beer I've ever had at a Deep Eddy Vodka distillery.
Next year, MEDIEVAL TIMES
Sooooo..Hard Rock Cafe next year?
@48:23 Weezer!?
Shout out the beautiful PCB spot!
I mean I think the only way you could top this is visiting every single Six Flags in America, Canada, AND Mexico.  ...you don't want to. It'd be 9,000 miles if you included the two parks they own and operate but don't have the Six Flags badge.
Isn't there a Margaritaville in Palm Springs?
2024: Every Chuck E Cheese in America
Lmao, next year do all 34 Hard Rock Cafés
pigeon forge is 100% a vegas strip for midwest tourist families. same with branson in missouri, a place i went to as a kid
Live, laugh, margaritaville
okay honestly? NOT here for the buc-ee slander 😠
Eddy and ted’s chemistry is amazing, two fantastic story tellers. This was the dumbest idea but they keep you on your toes the entire time
Who the fuck is Jimmy Buffet
37:30 that's also what Branson Missouri is like
Y’all missed the Margaritaville in Shreveport LA
2022: Every Rainforest Cafe 2023: Every Margaritaville 2024: Every Medieval Times
This feels like you outdid the mcleroy brothers.
Bubba Gump?
Hey if you do the next series of chain restaurants. If you are in the middle of dry land don’t order seafood. Most of the of the seafood is frozen. But not if you are on water or near water. But it needs to be nature. The riverwalk is man made and a few dead bodies has foat up… just take care of yourself now!!
"I could make a beach out of anything"
Bruh I used to work at the one in Biloxi 😂
I learn so much about America from these videos
Beach Burger in Burger Beach If you know, you know.
OK so I live under a huge rock… baby was at city walk WUT
Hard Rock Cafes next.
Please do something like this every year. It is peak content and I absolutely love it
This is classism and you can't convince me this person operates like a normal member of the working class.
so what I’ve learned is we just do it better in canada
Final? I’m hoping to see y’all going to every Chuck E Cheese!!!
Eddy, when you started reading that book to your friend, your friend was so brave if it was me I would've told you I would kill you but he didn't and he is so so so brave for that
If for some godforsaken reason you two do another massive road trip, maybe give yourselves a couple extra rest days. For your own sakes
What’s next… every Applebee’s? 😜
Please tell me you picked up a Buc-ee’s onesie for Danny’s baby
The way you and Ted said boloxi had ne dying
So up next is Bubba Gump's, right?
Anyone else watch Ted and Eddy’s videos and then immediately listen to “cheeseburger in paradise” “5 o’clock somewhere” and “margaritaville”?
Next up is all the Bubba Gumps, right?
Who cannot enjoy this man's pain ! He did this for ALL OF US !
The only margaritaville I’ve ever visited was the one at city walk years ago and I had an incredible time. I was plastered but the whole scene was so camp and loud they constantly played his music videos I was hooked
Bubba Gump next time pls
the hard rock cafe is next
Margaritaville on Lake Conroe Texas…?
Nice
hard rock cafe
What about the Cheese Cake Factory?
Ok now do McDonalds
I think Planet Hollywood is next I’m  calling it.
I live in the Cleveland area, and even I avoid that margaritaville. Love that you included northern ohio mascot, Tim Misny. His face is legend here. Another fantastic series, but RIP your gastrointestinal system.
babe  the coolest fothermuckers on the planet uploaded
Sooo Rub Buckeys Nuts on a Pillow...?
the bastard did it again
We never had a Margaritaville but we did have a CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE restaurant in my hometown. 100% also Jimmy buffet themed
bro you're an absolute beast
They also used to have a chain of Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants
Bubba Gump?
Do McDonalds next
Cant wait for next year 😉
An astonishing hour of entertainment. I have never heard of Jimmy Buffet before, hearing the name I assumed he is Warren Buffets entitled son opening restaurants all over the place. But good for him with the music.
"Liking Buffet isn't some weird cult thing, it's what can fix me." Says that one uncle as he forgoes yet another day of therapy to ignore his building depression & crumbling family life on his boat
Can't believe you did this and didn't invite the McElroy brothers smh
"Pour me somethin' tall and strong, this door is to remain unlocked during business hours." Truly words to live by from a wise sage.
Top tier! Had me laughing my ass off  Please help, can’t breathe, laughing too hard 😂😂
Destin pcb area best place ever i hate living here but fuck it its beautiful
You are fucking good my man 🎉 your editing is just so fucking awesome first video form you and not the last ❤ liked and subscribed
Justin McElroy would have joined you if u had asked, i reckon. He kinda likes james
please do Hard Rock Cafe next!
What about the Margaritaville cruise?
When eddy said that the rain forest cafe was comforting is the same feeling I feeling watching Ted and ed (except the part we’re he doesn’t want to spend a full day at it XD) these two videos were so funny and comforting to watch 😊
bro is hanging out w call me carson spin offs ☠️
I love how much you act like you hate it, and how much shit u and Ted give each other the whole time 😂🤣 we know u love it Eddy lmfaooo
Next would come hard rock Cafe I think, 35 locations in US and Canada.  Dine on both sides of Niagra falls.
I guess you can say Jimmy rustled him
Hey I’ve already seen this video
I gotta visit The Thing 😂😂
What happened at spencer
when he starts reading the jimmy book in the car.  XD
You should do hard rock cafes next there’s 34 locations
my dad is obsessed with jimmy buffet and one w the parrothead cult. he got an airplane wing for our backyard bc of it. its cute
Why is schlatt here? Why is he still around at all?
Eddy was in Tulsa
Can anyone tell me the name of the song in the beginning?
But you didn't stop at the Cheeseburger in Paradise in Virginia Beach.
I’m a it saddened you didn’t try Cedar Point or visit the islands on your way to Chicago from Cleveland……but I understand the siren song that is Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville
Next up: Red Robin
Can you do Bubba Gump Shrimp Next?
31:01 The way I CACKLED at the cat in the hat ride
theres a cheeseburger in paradise at legends in kck
Biloxi MS is pronounced Bil-uh-ksee
This needs an anime adaptation
“The THING?” Shirt at 36:51 had me dying
I fucking love how Eddy says Biloxi 💀
Mississippian's will get triggered by how you mispronounced Biloxi. It's Bil-uck-sea. Stop triggering me, Eddy. Did you guys drive through Gautier? Please tell me you didn't pronounce it Gau-Ti-er.
I grew up going to the Biloxi margaritaville arcade for my birthdays! My great grandma forced everyone to sign up for a membership so we could all eat the free buffet 💀
This place is real? I thought South Park had just made it up
20:19 well tbh as a Floridian we’re already so used to the rain it’s like it’s not even there 😂
I like that the smoke went off during “sorry”
The real friends was the Margaritaville we made along the way!
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. or Joe’s Crab Shack next!
Sir, you skipped the margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach what the heck
I used to live in Panama City when I was in medical school, so that’s the only MV I’ve ever been to. I went on a first date with a girl… then I never hung out with her again.
They still didn't kiss at the end :(
36:50 when Ted is wearing "The Thing?" TShirt is one off the funniest parts of the video and it goes so under the radar
Watching these are amazing hard rock cafe next
The worst choice in all this was renting a truck for a road trip. Especially a Tacoma, you guys must be 5'8"?
It’s funny to me that one of the best Margaritaville’s happens to be in my home country of Canada, yet the only Margaritaville that I’ve actually visited is possibly the one he hated the most, in Syracuse.
WHY SUBJECT YOURSELF
fat win
Love Teds ‘Thing’ t-shirt haha
Fun fact!  Jodi Arias worked in a margaritaville :,)
Ahh wish i could have seen you guys at MOA
Eat at every McDonald’s in the US
While in the mobile/Pensacola area, you had a chance to mention you were in the Mecca of Jimmy Buffet.
Next year do all the Bucc-ees, eating every meal from one. Could be interesting since they've expanded out of Texas.
You should follow a band while they tour the country.
Next up is “We visited every McDonalds in The United States
#15 on trending.  Way to go, Eddie!
For April Fools you should go to some one location local place, and say you went to every one in the country.
So Dick’s Last Resort next?
#20 on trending dude, congrats!!
37:27 America is insane, wtf 😂😂
2024: I went to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the Country
Spoiler Alert: 'The Thing' is a Native American corpse
for the next one go to every McDonalds in America
I reagconize city walk from South Park i believe they used to call into a Chinese restaurant their and he was say funny stuff like would you like to try our new city chicken and if you apply an accent to that you’ll know why it’s so funny😂
Do hard rock cafe next year, dont make this your last food road trip
america do be a fever dream
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe
I subbed to eddy after the rainforest cafe video. I love these totally unhinged challenges that no one is asking for 😂
I watched this sitting in my margaritaville folding chair
Alright, but consider: Eating at every chain restauraunt on the san antonio riverwalk.   Probably 4-5 chains in so you can really get proper PTSD
What was the second to last song in the video?
Jim.
I was in the same Buc-ee’s in Texas like a week ago I think
You should do Great Wolf Lodge next.
I’m sick of canadas blatant support of piracy
Alright, now Bubba Gump Shrimp
the cat in the hat screaming incoherently and then suddenly hearing YOUR MOTHER- sent me into a fucking fit. this is the first Eddy video i have ever seen, and i don't think ill ever be the same. thank you Eddy. thank you Jimmy Buffett. viva the alcoholtown!!!
Bruhhhhh the one time I’m not around the area😢
Where do I go for the feet pictures?
So Bubba Gump’s next year?
perfectly encompassed my feelings of the cat in the hat ride- never again
I’m so glad I watch this for a whole hour. I can’t wait to see how you ruin your stomach next year
Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!

LMAO...this is absolutely hilarious
This has some big cult vibes for sure. Cult of personality and whatnot.

Great! Now eat at every Medieval Times in America.
This is the greatest video on YouTube
Please consider a Medieval Times road trip.
That was magnificent
how about bubba gump next year?…no?
Do every Chuck E Cheese next.
I'm watching this video from under a Buc-ees blanket
I couldnt believe it when you said "Biloxi" instead of Biluxi" as a native Mississippean. Then i looked at the word and said wait why the hell do we say Biluxi lmao
Go to every McDonald’s in the United States next year
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT??
Can't wait for the Buc-ee's tour. I know you said this was the final road trip but we'll. See. Ya. At. All. The. Buc-ee's. Next. Year.

Visit every McDonald’s
47:13 was ADORABLE
Do not go to every hard rock eddy
i think that alien museum was a Scientology thing
can’t wait for part two when you guys go to the boston one when it opens !
I used to love 5 o'Clock somewhere when I was little... Just imagine a little Mormon kid belting "POOOOUR ME SOMETHIN TALL AND STRONG!!!" at the top of her lungs. (what did I think the song was even about??? Milkshakes???)  * I am no longer Mormon. I left the church over 10 years ago. But Kid-Me was as Mormon as it was possible to get.
i NEED you guys to hit up every MLB park
This was great I think you broke a world record or something lol
There use to be one close to my house……and we kinda miss it. Hahah. Really hope there is a song counter in this video!
You skipped Jacksonville’s location….
Waiting patiently for them to eat at all of the hard rock cafés
So I grew up in Charleston South Carolina and my mom, her friend, her friend's daughter, and I would go to Mrytle Beach for day trips every once and a while. Well my mom and her friend are big country music fans and of course love margaritas lol. So they ALWAYS wanted to go to Margaritaville. Well, when I was a kid I was super shy and anxious (I'm still anxious lmao) and Margaritaville scared the sh^t out of me. Why? The f^cking hurricane drink mixer. Growing up in South Carolina, hurricanes were very scary so obviously a hurricane simulating drink mixer in a restaurant was very scary to a small child with anxiety. My mom didn't really understand the whole anxiety thing back then so they always wanted to try and convince me to go to the restaurant. Nah, I screamed and cried and we never went. The first time I set foot in that restaurant and actually was ok with it was when I was TEN YEARS OLD. And I still hated the hurricane drink mixer, but at least I was able to sit down and enjoy the meal. If that wasn't a warning sign that I have an anxiety disorder, I don't know what was 😭 My mom definitely understands now and feels bad about how insistent she was on going to f^cking Margaritaville lol
Get a real job shill
Your style of comedy is insufferable. It’s not that bad of a restaurant. Stop being such a doomer
no nashville?!
Fun fact, Jimmy Buffet’s sister has a restaurant in gulf shores called Lulu’s
I've walked by that plane in Orlando a million times! I had no idea I was so close to royalty...
Y’all skipped the resort in Houston
please do a medieval times video next
Would you suggest this trip to someone but with 60+ restaurants in North America and it’s Benihana?
FUN FACT: A drunken fella threw up ALL over me at the Key West Margaritaville.. The staff offered me free merch to replace my soaked clothing. I haven't been back since..
He constantly blurs out his feet, I can’t 💀
I gotta say, while I would love more frequent videos or whatever, if they're all this quality I can wait. This was a wild trip.
I watched this on an 8 hour car ride and it made me feel like shit
You know, for place named after a song about how drinking sucks, there's a lot of drinking going on in these things.
Next year: I eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the country (and Canada!!)
Are you a real travel YouTuber until you’ve been to every Chili’s in the nation?
"Final trip"  Mhm... Cya next year for Hard Rock Cafe.
All the time spent having diarrhea is time spent self reflecting
As a resident of Syracuse ny I can confirm absolute garbage
Do the Hardrock Cafe next
Does anyone know what breed the dog is?
"Now if you don't know who Jimmy Buffet is -- " me, the daughter of a Parrothead who was named after one of this man's songs: no I'm good there but go on, Eddy
There’s two margaritavilles in Orlando smh
Bubba Gump when?
what about margaritaville at lake of the ozarks tho
Bubba Gump is next
now go to every bubba gump shrimp
you're a parrothead for real now :^)
So jimmy is now the monkeys in the bathrooms😂
now do bubba gump shrimp to complete the trifecta of awful tourist chain restaurants
Would it even be possible to do one of these trips as a vegitarian lol
Time for round 3: Hard Rock cafe?
As someone from a temperate rainforest (SE Alaska) the rain in florida actually is more dangerous because the heat makes the road dry out, so when it rains it reacts a lot differently than rain on a colder road. The heat makes the roads more slippery, im a high school dropout so i couldnt tell you why, but i have been told that florida rain is more dangerous on the roads. 🤷‍♀️
The Canadian National Anthem was exquisite.   Haha
Panama City Beach Margaritaville has mice and cockroaches. Take it from a local 😎
Missed the Margaritaville Hotel in Conroe, Texas that’s supposed to be a good one too
I’ll see you guys next year when they go to every bubba gump’s
Literally just ate at margaritaville in Vegas 2 days ago, lol.
Does the Margaritaville casino and resort in Bossier City, LA not have a Margaritaville restaurant?
Do red lobster next!
Wouldnt be a proper Atlanta trip without unbearable traffic
It seems like the next logical step is to go to every Hard Rock Cafe and become rockstars for your reward of being the only people to travel the country for TWO chain restaurants. Seems like a good celebration. Or perhaps Medieval Times, like the kings you are.
Do Wendy’s next
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next time!
Oh shit Ted did what I do when I’m in the elevator at the pigeon forge one
God speed Eddy Burbank and Jimmy Buffet. I will have a margarita today in your honor
If Ted ever dies under mysterious circumstances we can safely assume its because they tried to make a 3rd video in this series and Eddy couldn't take it any longer.
im dead at the Dr suess ride lmaoo @30:35
Great video Eddy, i’ll see everyone next year 🦅🦅
I watched your Rainforest Cafe video, and after finishing I thought to myself "well, that is a type of video he won't do again" and now here we are. I just want to say: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
Very enjoyable video, good job
When we went to buc-ee’s during a trip, the maps Siri voice said it correctly, then one sudden day we’re irritatedly arguing and suddenly it goes “Beu-Sees on the left” 😂😂😂 we all cracked up like why did it all the sudden forget how to pronounce Buc-ees
As an Arizonian, I'm so happy Eddy visited The Thing. A national treasure to be sure.
I had to take a break in the middle of watching this for two days...
now do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Hard Rock Cafe next??
Disappointed that you didn’t full send and go on a margaritaville cruise ship
16:21 i don't know where i'm gonna go when the volcano blows
Those kind of places always serve frozen foods.  You can buy better stuff at your local Wal-Mart.
I have IBS and a hiatal hernia i need surgery for. My tummy always hurts. 😂
They’re drinking and driving!
y'all should do John's incredible pizza next
petition for eddy and ted to eat at every bubba gump in the country next
The story is incomplete...there's a Margaritaville Cruise.
omg @jarvis
Im gonna be honest, it really didnt hit me how long it was until you said 1/12th of your year is gonna be spent in margaritaville😂😂
waiting on every chucky cheese
I went to one in the bahamas but thats the only margaritaville ive ever been to😂
What happens when jimmy Buffett dies
Part two: Margaritaville Cruise!
I never comment on vide but I’m EXTREMELY happy about this one. The rainforest cafe video was life changing.
Good thing you did this trip this year. Next year the Fort Myers Beach, FL Margaritaville restaurant and resort will be open.
The sequel we’ve all (mostly me I think) been waiting for!!!
You better go to every Bubba Gumps next
I live 2 cities over from Biloxi, MS. Can’t believe I was only 2 cities away from you dude lol. Excellent video. I’m also glad to hear you enjoyed the crawfish dish.
Now go to every McDonald's
hard rock cafe you won’t
Bubba Gump shrimp next 😊
When can we expect the "I ate at every McDonald's in the country" video?
I’ve only been to the margarita ville in chicago and i ordered the jambalaya. The jambalaya was indeed very bad!
Can't wait for next year when they eat at every Bubba Gump shrimp company in the country
You should do every Mc Donald’s next
Masochist!
No video or description can come close to show exactly how insane buckies is. But yours came close though :)  P.S.- that little shit freaks me out too
I'm 1/3 of the way through and realize he's probably not touring when you recorded this but ending with a JB concert would have been an amazing capper.
I guess the big ole honkin Margaritaville Casino in Bossier City, LA must not actually have a suitable restaurant that fit yall's criteria? I've played the slots there several times and live in Shreveport. Curious if y'all "forgot" that Margaritaville Casino or maybe skipped it due to a "technicality"? 🤔Maybe the property doesn't have a "Margaritaville Restaurant"? 🤔
Booba ❤
I love that I've literally never heard of Margaritaville ever before this LMAO
Can’t wait until you guys do Hard Rock Cafe.  If that’s something you hadn’t already considered, I’m really sorry if I just planted the seed in your head.
isn’t there one in nashville????
cant wait for next year when they eat at every casa bonita
Got a question. Did the Margaritaville in Lake of the Ozarks, MO not count or something? My sister worked there for two years so it popped into my head.
Next year "I ate at every Texas Roadhouse in Texas"  (There aren't that many, only like 70 in the state)
Time to hit every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant
love the Riverwalk! when I went to San Antonio during freshman year for a theatre competition and there was a guy there running like a food stand or something who offered to roast the shit out of everyone in our group for $5. fun times. we lost the competition but did pay $5 to get roasted by a random guy so I'd say that's a W
what about the Margaritaville in Capitola, CA 🤨🤨🤨
I enjoy how slowly you can see Eddy become the cult.
So… Bubba Gump is next, right?
28:19 moistcr1tikal impression?
they need to do a video just on dollywood now
Where can we find Chrissy's song about Margaritaville?
Used to work at the Chicago location.  Hearing Jimmy yell "I THINK WE MADE IT TO MARGARITAVILLE!" definitely triggered something in my memories lol  Also it looks more like a Chicago tavern because that's pretty much what occupied its space at Navy Pier before Buffett took it over.
Thank you for blessing us with this content Eddie 🙏
I actually has recurring nightmares about the Cat in the Hat ride growing up. I went on it again this year, and my fear was entirely justified
Eddy never fails to spread my cheeks
Thoughts on Jimmy buffet running cocaine across the Flordia Keys?
Give me 1 margarittaville and I’ll get tummy ache  Give me 2 margaritavilles and it goes to my head
So... what's the plan for next year? Every Hard Rock Cafe in America and Canada?
You skipped The Lake of the Ozarks
Hard Rock Cafe next lol
I heard about Margaritaville from South Park. Being from southeastern Europe, I had no idea what that was. I still have no idea WHY does this exist, and why did you do that, and why did I watch the whole damn video???
Next year is every Cracker Barrel or every Hard Rock
Now you've got to do Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood.
Great video. Now next year visit every McDonald's in the country.
Eddy. Eddy PLEASE. Go to every Medieval Times in the country (and Canada). There's only, like 10! Easy. (Also I work at one and could get you a juicy discount)
Their just run down and usually the lower class of any hotel or restaurants  I went twice. Which is enough They blend well with generic to me
My first thought was litterally "Moron". 2:15
hehe teddy burbivison
IM LAUGHING TOO MUCHHHHH AT THIS VID!!!
Please do McDonalds next 🙏
You should do every Applebee's next
Aye! Took my wife and child to the one in Biloxi Ms. and the server walked to the table and said, “Hey y’all I’m gonna go to the bathroom and I’ll be right back to get your drink order.”
I hope this becomes an annual thing
Fun fact about the plane. His plane was shot at by Jamaican police while it was carrying him, bono of U2 and his family. They mistook it for a drug smuggling plane and you can see some of the shotty patchwork they did to cover the holes in the Orlando boardwalk one. The incident is recounted in the song Jamaican mistaica.
Sooo... I know this was a lot, but if you're looking for another thing to do, an easier one might be to go to every six flags.  After writing this I went to see how many there are. There are a surprising 27. Holy crap. Why?!
"I think it might be tinnitus"😂😂😂😂😂
u guys didnt go to jacksonville fl :[[[
I am Greg
I’m sorry to inform you but you didn’t visit every single one in the country nor Texas, I can send you a video and pictures of a fully operational one here in my home town of Conroe tx. Good clickbait tho
I hate to burst Eddie’s bunny, but there is a small margarita ville at the Flint Michigan Airport. Not even kidding. So he missed one. 😂
You need to stop this (do hard rock now)
So no margaritaville cruise?
You people are insane and I love you
Pro tip Eddy, it’s pronounced bih luck-see not bih-lock-see
Nice duster
For what purpose ?? No I will NOT watch !
they had to run out of things to say to each other
No you have to do the hard rock cafe 😂😂
You skipped the location in Conroe, TX.
Last time? What about the 22 Bubba Gump Shrimps? What about the 29 Bennigan’s? What about the 35 Hard Rock Cafe’s? Eddy please, those chains need to drive you crazy on a super long road trip!
The boys are back in town babieee
29:06  Feeble attempt to recruit another victim into Jimmy Buffet's cult. I usually just watch their daily life for a month, find what they like to eat, plan a date, buy a car battery, invite to a nice restaurant, then stage a kidnapping where other cult members act as the employees and patrons (which makes the only people in the restaurant in on the kidnapping, which is why a month is vital to get everyone hired), then kidnap and brainwash them into thinking I am a victim of kidnapping using the car battery on myself (mostly for pleasure, not neccessary but is fun), and convince him to join my following
Casa bonita vid when
I wouldn’t listen to me either
I feel so bad for my parents rn because I definitely made them go on the cat in the hat ride so many times in a row
Next is all of the airport Margaritavilles 🙃
Next time: “I’m going to visit every McDonalds in America… and Canada!…. And Europe!!!”
sounded just like charlie in fl🤣
But does it have to be the final road-trip? What about every bubba-Gump?
I’m so happy for another chain-restaurant roadtrip from you oh my GOD
The video i didn’t know i needed
Now do every McDonald's
Can’t wait for “I went to every bubba gumps in the world” next year
on the way to myrtle beach when i think to myself: “oh buddy you’re gonna hate this”
What about the Air Margaritaville in the Fort Lauterdale airport?
Shouts to jimmy and the culture 🔥 great video Eddy!!
So is TGI Fridays a bad place to eat?
It's bill-ucks-ee. Just FYI :^)
It'd be too dangerous to walk around with all the rizz dripping from that hat.
as a clevelander i was not expecting to see a tim misny billboard in a video about margaritaville
Do Buca di Beppo next
bubba gumps next
As someone near Cleveland, I'm sorry you didn't have a great meal, but the fact you put a Tim Misny billboard in your video made me laugh.  His stare is everywhere. Edit: Located at 46:32 for the curious.  And thanks for all the likes!
I’ve been to the one in myrtle beach the hurricane has a bottle that comes out and pours into the blender
Okay but when will we get the Hard Rock Cafe tour happen?
Now to do all 35 Hard Rock Cafe locations in the US including Hawaii.
Are we not going to talk about the margaritaville cruise !
but why
You should do lulus restaurant which were opened by jimmy’s sister
glad to see nakey jakey is still alive
$20 Bucks they do Hard Rock next
Yall should have gone on the Margaritaville cruise
Now you must visit the Cheesecake Factory in every single state in America!!!!!! Not every single one because there are too many. Every major city or capital. Do it, Do it, Do it!
the one in destin used to be a great restaurant called the lucky snapper. I hated to see it leave and get replaced by margaritaville
for the next road trip….HARD ROCK CAFE international!!!!
Can’t wait for episode 3- Hard Rock Cafe
okay, next road trip, every Bubba Gump Shrimp
Next you should visit every at Mcdonald's
yall should go to all the bubba gumps next
Bubba gumps shrimp next!!
Im sorry but we need a million more of these. Bubba gump shrimp, medieval times, Hard Rock Cafe. I need more
Um..is there gonna be a restock on the margarita button up cause I’m going on a cruise in September and that shirt would be great with my outfit 😭
I live in Florida and the rain here can be a next level nightmare.
Now do McDonald's and pretend to be Ronald
You won’t do the Hard Rock Cafe trail…
cant wait for next year
Eddy… there are 34 Hard Rock Cafes across the us… just saying….
You did it again. Why do you hurt yourself this way?
Ted seems like a buzz kill. Maybe travel with someone you actually enjoy being with if you do this again.
Awe you guys skipped the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks, in Missouri. Can only say you’ve been to most.
Cracker barrel next??   Profit???
My first thought was if you did this with Ted. You did not disappoint bros.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
"Any cannabis in your car?" "no" Well theres your problem! All food is 10x better when you're baked.
Am I crazy? I could have sworn there was one in Hawaii
Bubba Gump Shrimp next… 23 locations!! Let’s goooo
I love these videos so much!!! Thanks for the sacrifice Eddy.  Does anyone remember Bennigans? There are still 13 left across the country! How about a “turkey O’toole” Eddy?
Next please go to all the bubba gump shrimps next
imagine working at rainforest cafe....................... ide rather work at McDonalds at the drive thru....... cause ide end up filling my ears holes with cement
I clicked on this video to see if the resort I worked at would be included... It wasn't lol. There is a Margaritaville resort with a water park in Buford, Georgia! It is called Margaritaville at Lanier Islands.  I'm not saying you guys need to go BUT it would be fun to see a familiar place lol
I love these videos!
I know you’re never doing this again, but if you do you got to do Bubba Gump
as a chicago native, i too run to the bean whenever im in distress
*the shot where it looks like your being filmed from inside The Bean
Anyone know the song at 38:40
I have never heard of Jimmy Buffet or Margaritaville, but if I ever visited one of these restaurants, I would leave as a Jimmy Buffet Cult member
The definition of insanity
Next Year: Eating at every Arby's in the United States (& Canada)
There used to be cheeseburger in paradise restaurants too 😭 RIP
You guys should go to every Applebees in the country
So we’re not acknowledging the Margarita Ville in Hawaii?
Best series there is on YouTube
Unpixelated foot reveal at 2 million subs, please!
That Canadian Margaritaville looked pretty great.
….give me one margarita…
Californians: oh shit what is this wet stuff pouring from the sky? how can anyone drive? Texan (from Houston, in my case): Lmao, I've forgotten what a dry road looks like. Silly Calif-- OH, FUCK, A SNOWFLAKE! CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN; THERE'S A 10-CAR PILE-UP ALREADY. CHAOS REIGNS.  I lived in Lubbock, Texas for four years while in university. Black ice covers the roads for half of the year while floods occupy the rest (no storm drain system planned in the flat plains. What foresight. >2min of rain = flash floods). Turns out no matter how snowy/frozen it gets even if it's for the majority of the year, if you're still in Texas, Conservatives don't believe budgets are meant to go towards public safety things like, idk, sanding/salting the road, snowplows, or winterizing the power grid...
Next you'll check out Cheeseburger in Paradise right????!?!?
You didn’t go to the one in DTW airport!
why did you do this
Does this mean the next one is Planet Hollywood
Next up, Bubba Gump Shrimp
Well I'm from Florida and the rain isn't such a big deal!
Chuck E Cheese next year, let’s go!!!
As someone who grew up in Syracuse but hasn’t been there in over a decade:  I SWEAR there was a Rainforest Cafe (or some local rip off with trees and animals?) right about where that Margaritaville appears to be today. As if being in Syracuse wasn’t bad enough.   And that mall is basically cursed as is. 😂
Only makes sense to do Bubba Gump shrimp👀👀
I am from Florida and the rain is indeed a big deal. It's common, but it is still a big deal.
imagine if he did all the applebee's in north america
Cant wait for next year's bubba gumps road trip
I’m gonna be that person and say that Biloxi isn’t pronounced how it looks- it’s ‘Bih-lux-ee’. I’m so sorry for being like this.
next, you should do every Hard Rock Cafe in NA, or the world
Next is bubba gump!
I cant WAIT till they go to ALL of the Medieval Times together! or should I say Ted-Eddyval Times.. ok ill leave
Our Margaritaville in Mississippi just expanded to a fair park too it has an Escape Room too
I've been to 3 Jimmy Buffett concerts in my life, each one for my birthday. The second concert, I tricked my friend (who had never listened to Jimmy Buffett and had no idea what she was getting into) into coming with me.  When we got about 2 miles from the exit we needed, she started commenting on the number of out of state cars and why traffic was so bad. I told her about Parrot Heads, and she refused to believe that was why all this was happening. We then watched every out of state car take the same exit as we did and follow the road into the venue parking lot.  I think that was probably the moment she decided she didn't want to be my friend anymore. 😅😅
why?
The amount of money...
Drinking at the Margaritaville in Orlando made me wish Broken Lizard would’ve built a Pina Coladaburg directly across from it. Jimmy Buffet got nothin on Coconut Pete
The one that conjured food for you guys after hours was touching honestly
I think you meant Pina coladaburg
Misney let’s gooo! Woo tim misney got on to YouTube let’s gooo!!
Trying to get that McElroy level Jimmy hookup, huh?
#13 on trending???? HOW WHY congrats
I’m frankly stunned I sat and watched this all. It’s so compelling.
Thank you for your service.
As a Texas you better put respect on my boy buccee
Dick's Last Resort next year.
when we go to myrtle, my cousin always makes us go to margaritaville. none of us like it
Im kickijg myself rn, i was just in Pigeon forge and passed the Margarittavile
I think the best news about this trip is me knowing the Margaritaville in Muncie,IN closed several years ago so you didn’t have to go to Muncie,IN
Please do bubba Gump next
Waiting for when the sequel where eddy goes to every McDonalds in the world
heyyyyy at 36:04 you can see the building i lived in for 3 out of my 4 years in college
do a hard rock cafe road trip next 😎
as a floridian with a jimmy buffet hyperfixation, thank you  🫡
Next year it'll be bubba gumps
There is a margaritaville in capitola California but am not seeing it in the map or video. Is this one a fake or was it overlooked 🧐
Visit every Waffle House after 2AM. That would be like COPS.
Does Margaritaville not have a salad on the menu?
Now do Hard Rock Cafe next! 😅
14:25  please don't pronounce Biloxi like that
A retired couple ate at every Cracker Barrel, and survived.
last year I went on vacation to pidgeon forge with my bf and his housemates, we went to the island, and I wanted to get on the ferris wheel sooo badly but we left without doing it, so watching eddy do it gave me some closure lol
next year you should try Medieval times
Jimmy is love, Jimmy is life.
Hard Rock Cafe
Yall should do Bubba Hump next year
there is another margaritaville
Next year, you’ve GOT to do Bubba Gump. There’s one in Mall of America and there’s ~22 total. Also there’s one in Gatlinburg so maybe you could schedule in time to see Dollywood?
I never noticed Jimmy's mole. how?
Cheesecake Factory next 😂
Try every McDonalds and get back to us in 2032.
everyone place your bets now, is next year gonna be medieval times or bubba gumps shrimp company
now you need to go on a Margaritaville cruise, which apparently is the worst cruise in the world
Laying on the couch and from my sideways angle Eddy looks like Gene Belcher cosplaying Bob Belcher. And I love it.
We love eddy completing side quests 🙌🙌
i just went to PCB florida. never ate at margaritaville, but there are far better resturaunts in the area. i would recommend bayou bills, thomas doughnuts, or diegos burrito factory on front beach road
As a Floridian all I can say is “Thank You!” and “I am sorry!”
OH SHIT COOLEST MOTHERFUCKERS ON THE PLANET
Better start planning next years trip to Bubba Gumps Shrimp!
I’m from key west and I’ve never been to the Margaritaville! I have heard that Jimmy frequents it though.
They allowed JSchlatt back in Margaritaville after last time?
I gotta know the song that’s used when eddy is thinking about ending Ted at like 52:00
Soooooo bubba gump shrimp co next right king?
I find it really fascinating that this was the video that made me realize that I find Eddy attractive (also because I'm a lesbian, but the new merch shirt really did something for me)
There’s one in Medford Oregon
I honestly never thought we’d get a sequel. If this is going to be a yearly thing please get some good life insurance lmao
The casino in Tulsa is actually owned by the Muskogee Creek Nation. It's a shame you didn't have time on this trip to experience more of the area. Downtown Tulsa has a lot of real gems! This was a fun video and I'm sorry for your tummies!
Yea you definitely didn’t go to all the ones in Texas
Now do every mcdonalds location in the US...
As a person with Bipolar II, this is just how my life is lol
That southwest chicken salad is a national embarrassment
14:23 Eddy, it's pronouced buh·luhk·see not BAL-OX-SEE
I legit had this idea after watching your rainforest cafe video so i'm thrilled someone is actually doing this!!
Where do you think they’re going next year?
Such a great video. Watching Eddy slip into an existential crisis was the absolute chef's kiss.
Do hard rock cafe
ted sliding back into the chair is killing me
Hey eddy native Mississippian here. Just so you get a hillbilly hit squad armed with shotguns and some shit that fires fireworks. Biloxi is pronounced Beh-lux-e
Every Hooters in America next?
I went to the one in west gate AZ it closed because it was Crap the margarita is lower than mid supposed to be the best meh.
now i can’t wait to watch teds side of the trip
Another EPIC journey!!.
So... The Thing must be a rotating exhibit. What I saw was completely different
do Hard Rock Cafe next
That's the most crowded I've ever seen Cat in the Hat. Everytime I've rode it is been a instant walk on.
you guys should go to every bubba gump
fun fact about the hemisphere dancer, it almost got shot down by the Jamaican government because they mistook it for a drug plane. Bono was in the back during the whole thing. He ended up making a song about it titled "Jamaica Mistaka" which almost was the name of my first sailboat (definitely a mistaka)
Love that you fell for that tourist trap on your way to El Paso 😂😂
Coming here after the Rainforest Cafe video. I have never eaten anything at Margaritaville that was good. I'm from Myrtle Beach, SC. I feel for you bro.
I see a lot of suggestions but it’s hard to top Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe for How Themed a restaurant is, how intensely specific the experience is and how insane it would feel to repeat it… so here’s my recommendation for next year: Hamburger Mary’s. There’s only 14 of them in the US and Canada, but I think that, among other factors, might make it a less painful road trip?
y’all missed lake lanier
Reminds me of two men in a lighthouse slow madding creep
What about the Margaritaville in Conroe, TX?
America is a weird place.
What about the Margaritavillie in Capitola?
If you’re driving 9000 miles why the HELL are you driving a truck?
dude Ted used to drive a 2002 Tacoma? what a chad
Eddies such a cute lil guy. love coming along on his lil adventures :)
Now the impossible. Hard Rock Cafe
Liked and subscribed because your tummy hurts.
Did you skip the one in palm springs or am I going crazy?
I haven’t laughed this hard in awhile 😂
You guys didn’t go to the Margaritaville in Bossier City, Louisiana,,,,,,why not? My daughter’s first trip on her 21st birthday to her first Margaritaville, she won $10,000 playing slots!
Ive been to rainforest cafe but never in margaritaville. So i might try it
Now go to every Bubba Gump’s shrimp
Shoutout to Brayden in texas thats a lucky guy fr
Yall should do dicks last resort there are 14 locations
I’m a local but the Hollywood, FL location is actually pretty good and the resort itself is very nice.
Eddy how do you have the willpower for these things
Hard Rock Casino next?
Hard Rock Casino next?
I gotta say I think I could do your job my man.
Jimmy Buffet audio book when?
You would go to the Dells as a Kid? Where did you grow up?
Now this is true Salt Life
its crazy to think that at SOME point, Eddy Burback and Ted Nivision passed through Dalton, Ga, on I75, on their way to Nashville. So insane
There's one in palm springs too
See you guys next year when you guys go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S and Canada!
Next up: Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Shack.
Whoever is making sofi’s sponsorship decisions rules lol
Eddie, you're a madman.  Edit: Hey bro, you ever think about doing a video on airhogs?
This makes me proud to be Canadian 🍁🥞🫎
Theres two margaritaville's in texas . . .
u should do McDonald’s next!!
You didnt goto the Margaritaville at the Lake of the Ozarks what the heck
Snakebite Key was his domain!
The food sucks.  The restaurants are dirty and smell bad.
This vid brought my grandpa back to life and he is jamming to Jimmy Buffett help
Thank you for your content, but for the love of Christ please spare your body from this punishment.
What ab Boston Margaritaville 🤨 opened in spring of this year
"34:10 but on our drive [to atlanta] traffic completely stopped"  GOOD OL ATLANTA TRAFFIC FOR YA! GOTTA LOVE IT!
Eddy. Ted. It's the sequel no one asked for for kind of needed
while watching this i got an ad in my email saying "its 5 o'clock somewhere with these savings!"  Jimmy's watching...
I aint watchin alla dat
I'm calling it now: next year they will visit all BubbaGumps restaurants
as someone who lives in south carolina, the highway to atlanta does that full stop thing like, hourly. so sorry you guys had to deal with that, hopefully you wont have to take that trip again
As someone that has worked in a Margaritaville resort for many years. Margaritaville is one of those brands that just seems to follow me through life 😂😭 I can’t believe u posted this I can’t wait to watch haha
David Foster Wallace would have loved this concept
I pass by a margaritaville going to my office and I have never been sad about never having stepped inside til now
I’ve ripped ass in that ferris wheel
Have you had Casa Bonita yet? I ate there on Thursday. The food was so salty (I got the carnitas tacos) that it was hard to finish my meal..I still ate it cause I ordered the Bee’s Knees drink and I wanted food in my stomach (the drink was good, the mojito wasn’t great). I think you’d enjoy the experience& your can film inside, just not during the couple of shows they have
Eddy where do I pay to see your feet?
Every Bubba Gumps next year?
Am I the only one who didnt know Margaritaville was a restaurant/resort. Like I always thought it was just signs for a town I was passing through called Margaritaville.
He honestly was pulling off the hat.  Edit: Not the hat he actually got. That is fucking hideous. Oh no.
best part was the manatee eating lettuce 🥬
Saw the video title and was very worried about you going to the Syracuse one.  Yeaahhhhhhh.  Also always avoid Spencer lol
Can't wait to see these guys do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next Summer!!
I clicked this thinking "Hey, there's one of those in our local mall. Bet he hates it."  I feel vindicated.
The alien dinosaur museum was not on my bingo card
I have a 2003 Tacoma and the new ones just aren’t the same
You skipped the one in Jacksonville!!!!! You didn’t eat at every one.
“I beat the child” - Eddy
there's also a margaritaville resort currently being built in fort myers
Gimme one  margarita imma… well you know the rest.
Those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it.
Love Chicago dude “oh, shit! It’s the coolest motherfuckers on the planet” classic
This is Ted’s origin story.
40:50 Ted considering the pros and cons of taking a flight off of the nearest cliff's edge.
You summoned that Rainforest Cafe in the Mail of America with your bad vibes, bro. 50:30
So next year are the 23 US and Canadian Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory locations, right?
Thanks for your sacrifice 🫡
The Dr Seuss ride really hit hard. A few years ago my dad, my brother and I were at universal Orlando when a huge wind/rain storm hit. We had forgotten our rain stuff (it hadn’t rained the whole trip) and the rain was literally flooding the park so everyone was told by employees to take cover in whatever indoor ride was closest to them. We were part of the unfortunate group that happened to be passing through the Dr Seuss land. We were forced to go on the cat in the hat ride over and over and over. All while being drenched from head to toe, in a room full of wet, sweating families. Nightmares forever.
This was a ride but I was here for it.
But what if you went to every Medieval Times? 🤔
HES DONE IT AGAIN
Do McDonald’s next
Oh shit! Coolest mothafukkas on the planet! -- that legit did me in 😂
I agree with the person who said Bubba Gump Shrimp next! 34 total, 23 in the US!
I can't wait for next year's idiotic trip to every [restaurant] in the US and Canada.
48:30 weezer
Aww I'm sad he missed out on the karaoke night at the Niagra Falls location. Hands down one of the hypes chain restaurant experiences I've ever had
Do macdonald's next year
Aye ya missed the margaritaville at the lake of the ozarks
You didn’t go to margaritaville bossier city
Next year is Hard Rock Cafe?
this was incredible and made me laugh like few videos ever do. thank you for putting your mind and body through hell (and margaritaville) for our silly little entertainment. y'all are real ones! what a journey.   that said... hard rock cafe next? or god forbid.... hooters?
Hard rock!!!!
Every Hard Rock Cafe in 1 year????
Did you just skip Destin?
I laughed so hard when you were on the Cat In The Hat ride. XD
i like to think that ted is like a tyler durden situation, and eddy’s just doing this all himself
THE SAGA HAS MORE, I SURE HOPE THE NEXT IS DAVE AND BUSTERS
What a great sequel. And honestly now I just want to go on vacation. Can't wait for you to go to every cheesecake factory in the country
I think Bubba Gump and Midieval Times should be next...and then for the coup de grais a Hard Rock Cafe World Tour...........Every single Hard Rock Cafe in the world over the couse of like 1 to 2 years. In a six part series per region....
"I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)" was written by Jimmy, right?...
THE THING? ROADSIDE TRAP CHANGED CONCEPTS?!?! That's what I got out of this. Holy shit I need to go again, it's totally different.  (Day 2 7:57)
Dang you actually broke Ted in Ohio 😂
The music from Succession is the cherry on top
But what would the campus pastor lady have to say about all these margaritas
Hi, boys!!  Did you forget about Bubba Gump? 😈😈😈🍤🥘😭
My first response when i saw this  "AhHhHH! He did it again!"
The sequel we didn’t know we needed
I just love the personality you have in your videos. Everything is just so fun and lighthearted
I remember being traumatized as a child when my family visited myrtle beach. We went to margaritaville cause my dad loved jimmy buffet. I was always afraid of storms as a baby
Schlatt bout to commit a war crime
you better go to Casa Bonita after it reopens
Your name has the vibe of a parody of a politician
53:01 😂😂😂
Awh I feel so bad for you putting yourself through this for us…. Do it again.
Every time you do one of these I feel so patriotic (I'm Canadian)
The part 2 we never knew we needed
How did you miss the Margaritaville Cruise?
This is honestly the best video I have watched on YouTube since idubbbz’s full force. Thank you Eddy.
Compelling vid as always burback
This is great, and I’m really proud of you. HOWEVER, you have missed the Margaritaville on the Margaritaville Cruise Ship. This trip is incomplete.
I went to the one in cleveland on Father’s Day a couple years ago and got sick from the food too lol
I ate at a margaritaville for the first time this year and literally said "this is just Rainforest Cafe for adults". So this is a natural progression for eddy
Eat at every McDonald’s ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha wow that sure would be a lot of clown burgers
God this man is so dramatic
Just noting that there are 23 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaurants in the United States
I went to Gatlinburg for my Bachelorette party and we went to the Pigeon Forge Margarita. They brought my food out like an hour after everyone else’s. We then went to the moonshine store where you can do several shots of moonshine for $5
I want you to do "I ate at every McDonalds in the country and Canada" video .  PS :Subway is fine too
there are two more margaritavilles in Texas?
im absolutely furious about the toes
You skipped one in Texas
please do bubba gump next
Too bad you didn't have the Deep Eddy margarita in Texas, especially in San Antonio, since it is a brand from Austin. It would have added a special sauce to the Texas section.
What about the land shark bar and grills?
Aliens did 9/11?
Soooo Hard Rock Cafe is next right???
I like how the video progresses the happiness slowly fades
Are you freaking kidding me? I’m so obsessed with these videos this was a light in my dark life
A must see
Jimmy really needs to see this though to weed out the issues at some of the chains
I believe a man named Dan Murry is responsible for the fish  and chip thing. He is in charge of culinary ops Margaritaville? He should be embarrassed to even sell frozen product like that for that price!!! Well have fun with him!
46:32 MISNEY MAKES THEM PAY
“Ted needed the room to get some work done” okay bud.
Aliens vs Dinosaurs vs Justin Beiber is where its at, bro.  Hope Buffett is down to soundtrack 👍
Next challenge: every Tim Hortens in Canada. Now hear me out this would be the ultimate challenge there are 3,531 tim Hortens in Canada spread out across 9,984,670 km2 of land with some being far up north in military bases.
bro your shits musta been vile
I just realized YouTube had been pushing your video on me but I clicked Ted’s first. In order to make amends I will now watch your videos back to back😌
Nice content
as a Niagara Falls native no wonder i've never given the Margaritaville here a second glance--the pirate mascot always made it feel like a place for kids. Love it's the only one with a different mascot. love this city. glad to know niagara falls is 2/2 for american chain restaurants that are only here
I live in Southern Arizona and I don't  know what "The Thing?" is. I can't wait to find out.  Edit: not disappointed
The production value on this is insane 😂
I can’t wait to come back next year when Eddy posts about visiting every Voodoo Doughnuts in the country.
Eddy, you sick freak YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN
I too got lost in that mall and got a drink there
I can appreciate the effort put into this, but I feel like shit having spent an hour on Margaritaville. To have actually gone to all of them (not to mention every Rainforest Cafe) must completely change a person's outlook on life.  And not for the better.
So there’s a second margaritaville (sort of) near Atlanta. It’s a resort. They have a water park, golf courses, campground, and cottages. It’s called “Margaritaville at Lanier Islands.” It’s in Buford GA, about 45 minutes north of Atlanta
BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP IS NEXT 🤣
let’s goo
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp next year
Ii remember there's a Margaritaville in Maui also.  Unless it's gone out of business since then..
As a Minnesotan it's fantastic seeing you eat at all the restaurants in the Crayola corner. Can't wait for Bubba Gump next😄
so now matpat will make a video about margaritaville lore in 2 weeks
As a southerner the way he pronounces Biloxi is hilarious
I can’t believe you didn’t stop and go on the margaritaville cruise from west Palm beach.
46:31 Tim Misny jump scare
Being indoctrinated by margaritaville is probably better experience than Scientology.
ok 3 feet jokes in im starting to think it isnt a joke  edit: make it 4 edit 2: now its 5 edit 3: bro its 6 you gotta stop
bro what?
Y’all pass my house otw to ac i just think that’s kewl
That was more of a gumbo than jambalaya
you didn't go to the one in Vancouver Canada.
This guy is an avengers level threat
Tim Misney!
u missed margarita ville in jacksonville
me: oh no, he's drinking the kool-aid.  my partner, who is watching with me: no, he's drinking the margaritas
Key West is no joke one of my favorite places in the world. It's beautiful, and it's truly got something for everyone. If you ever go back, check out the Hemmingway House.
Can’t wait until next summer for the Bubba Gump trip
It’s like the reverse of Tom Grossi’s 30 in 30 😂😂😂
I think I might’ve blacked out from Margaritaville energy overload, but did they miss the one at Lake of the Ozarks?
Ok, do another fool 🫵
I can't believe you did this again, maddest lad out there haha
Hey there, Syracuse native here. I actually work at the movie theater in the mall that the Syracuse Margaritaville is in and can offer some insight.  1: Destiny USA is not doing great in 2023. It's still the 4th biggest mall in America and popular, but Covid and (frequent) violent crimes occurring at it definitely hurt it financially. 2: The main clientele for the Syracuse Margaritaville is *very* old people. At least once a week I have an elderly couple turn up to my movie theater to ask for directions to the Margaritaville. 3: Your comments about the Margaritaville being "lifeless" and "easily the worst" ring true of Syracuse as a whole. We've got a very thriving local culture but we all wish we were somewhere else.  Regardless, great video! If you ever find yourself in Syracuse again and want to risk getting stabbed or shot, swing by the movie theater in Destiny and say hi.
Eddie it’s pronounced “Bilucksi” not “Bilocksi”
Bubba Gump Shrimp!
There was a restaurant called cheeseburger in paradise, I think it’s like Margaritaville and my mom told me I told a waitress that jimmy buffett couldn’t sing 💀 (I think I was 4)
There is this old parable that comes to mind… “If something happens once, it will never happen again. But if something happens two times, it will surely happen a third time.” What is in store…
nakeyjakey!!!!
Next step: see the margaritaville musical (yes, it exists, and it was on Broadway)
I do not want to subject you this experience because I appreciate you but also please do Dave N Busters next!!!
What about the Jurassic World Margaritaville?
Fun fact, There are 10 medieval times in the US
Every Bubba Gumps in the US for 2024
What if meteorites are just alien nukes tho
THE THING IS THE BEST PART OF ARIZONA!!!!!!!!
Ooh that meant you had to go to Panama City Beach.   I apologize. It's not great here. But hi.
It’s time to visit every Bucees
Here me out...visiting every bucees in America.
Do mcdonald’s next!
I can’t believe Ted was in Mississippi and I missed it lol  P.s. Ted it’s pronounced Buh•luhk•see. Just thought I’d let you know before people start ripping you apart oof
goddamn eddy you’ve done it again
Sorry to break it to you, but there’s at least one Margaritaville in the USVI. That’s part of the US as well . . .
Hi, YouTube just threw me here but I think I'm in love with this man
Art.
Maybe he should have checked his own car with this critical eye before last trip 🤣
Don't see it in the comments, but Margaritaville Resort in Lake of the Ozarks, MO was skipped. Maybe because the Margaritaville Resort has a Landshark restaurant?
Eddy needs to do a US tour of bubba gump restaurants next
yikes indeed
I’m Australian and this has no cultural or nostalgic importance to me, I’m only watching because YouTube was trying to deep throat me with this video, cheers mate.
I love watching Eddy be in denial
26:00
Something about taking a break from Margaritaville to order a margarita at Rainforest Café
It was nice seeing footage from your trip to Myrtle Beach. I have family who lives down there and I haven't seen them in years, so it was nice to see it again.
Do Hard Rock Cafe next year.
B'ys, if you're gonna get fish and chips you HAVE to do it in a place that is near an ocean that actually fishes cod. That's the only place that it won't be shit.
for gods sake drink a beer instead man
I want to know where Eddy gets all these fire shirts. The guy is on island time.
It would be cool if this was yahlls friendly tradition instead of going to every __ yahll hop in the car and drive cross country and visit random museums and restaurants
Pls do going to every Hard Rock Cafe in the world
At least there are only 10 Medieval Times for you to go to
40 minutes in he has lost it. Lol
What about margaritaville at sea?
Bro this is legit a movie. A damn good one.
You're doing the lords work.
There is also now a Margaritaville RETIREMENT COMMUNITY in Florida. I drove by it and was PERPLEXED
I used to clean the margaritaville at city walk in Orlando, and at 6 am every morning techs would come in the test the volcano so every morning for 6 months I had to endure Jimmy Buffet loudly singing margaritaville at 6 am while I was half asleep and trying to sweep chip covered floors. The video was lowkey triggering 😭
Ted on the 400mg THC edible shit again that’s how he survived this
Do another one
if you guys decide to do another tour that takes you to universal, stop by the caricature stand. please. I want to draw your moustache.
Yo it was so cool of that manager for letting you eat and giving you some good food so late thats hype
you guys are amazing... please be safe, but this was so worth it,  showing how this is possible !
Please make this a yearly thing.
.. every bubba gump shrimp next ?
The red rainforest logo reflected in your glasses is absolutely perfect
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxR_85ICVtkhyl1zzNast9SWCfrHswn9yL🤫
I can't wait for bubba gumps next year
Looks like you skipped the Margaritaville in Shreveport
This is one of the few times in life that the sequel is as good as the first one
The only things i know about margaritaville is what ive learnt from Randy Marsh
2024 prediction: The Cheesecake Factory
Can you go to every bahama breeze?
sent this to my mom
crazy thing is you guys are legit rainforest cafe celebrities.
Ok but that Jimmy Buffet book sounds completely coconuts
hard rock cafe?
Y’all gotta do bubba gumps next
drew wanted to whack it dont lie
this is the first video that i’ve seen from you, but i can say with certainty that you are now my favorite youtuber. this video was amazing! got to get that margarita shirt too
I didnt know Marc Maron has a happier little brother, I had to subscribe.
Can't wait to see you guys do Hard Rock Cafes next year!
Now do every mcdonalds
What’s the next thing.. Hard Rock Cafe??
The “What If?” Museum had no business going that hard outta nowhere
West coast Florida really is so pretty
I wasn't going to watch another restaurant chain road trip video but here I am 56 minutes in
I love Margaritaville.
I have not heard of this more than once but I'm down to watch a 50 Minute Video about it
you say it the final time but yall still have to hit the hard rock cafés
What is on your face?
The Tim Misney billboard in Cleveland lol
Lol you guys missed the margaritaville in sandusky ohio. I would have really loved your comments on that one
46:32 Everyone in Cleveland recognizes those eyebrows
Jimmy Buffet touched my hoohaa
im so glad i stumbled upon such a chaotic video
I’m so glad that of all the sights in Cleveland, you only chose to show us Tim Misny- truly, he haunts all of northeast Ohio 😂
Theres only one thing left to do; Visit Every Hard Rock Cafe
buccee's would be pretty neat if it weren't for all the obsessed crazies who seem to always be there
Eat at every McDonalds
Used to be one in my town when I was younger. It's no longer there because I'm sure people got tired of hearing Jimmy Buffet over the speaker. Not to mention there was no beach, in the midwest, and it was located just south of Indianapolis.
NOOOO did you get to see the margarita hurricane in Myrtle Beach??
I was going to ask why you guys would do this to yourselves again before I realized that the real question is why am I watching two people put themselves through this again, and more importantly, why am I so into it?
Dude you better go to  Casa Bonita when it's finished
You guys missed one in Montgomery texas 👀👀
Judging by the map in the thumbnail and opening he might have missed the one in Shreveport Louisiana but I'm not really interested enough to watch the entire video to find out just thought I'd point it out
tice nits
even sam bankman loved margaritaville
Now eat at every McDonald's.
The way I gasped when I saw this video pop up😂
Next every ihop waffle house or brothel in North America
Nice passed through elpaso.
Can’t wait for next year “I ate at every Bubba Gump shrimp co”
He really said "rainforest cafe wasn't filling enough"
Both of you saying no and nodding your head at the same time was amazing
It’s the Chef’s Table music that really sells this🤣
Next yahll be going to every Bucc-ees 😂
Wasting away again in Margaritaville
The one in AZ closed a while back
Every Landshark next
I NEED TO KNOW IF THAT ELEVATOR WAS AN OTIS OR A THYSSENKRUPP.  (It sounded like a shitty elevator so my money is on Thyssenkrupp since Thyssenkrupp was ran by shitty nazis back during the war and who knows, maybe after?)
Hi all. I hope you are doing well. I would like to share the good news with you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything and is Sovereign over everything. God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.
Why can nobody pronounce Biloxi?
Eddy once again reminds me that we are prisoners of our own circumstances. We can all do better to live the life we want to lead.
I'm completely okay if this is the future of your channel
Now do every Applebees
I will always be team Rainforest Cafe.
fortnite
Next year: every hard rock cafe location!
If this doesn't happen again next year with another chain I  will be so crushed 😂
Hi Eddy I believe you skipped the Jacksonville Florida Margaritaville so I’m sorry you have to remake your video
What do you say, Cheesecake Factory next year? Edit: Rip Jimmy  May you have a Buffet in heaven, pun intended
I love the biloxi margaritaville so much
Now do Dicks last resort
Why?
‘We’re headed to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina’  I’m so sorry Sighed A North Carolinian
What about the one on Lake conroe
You are, what they call a “TRUE HERO”
It was awesome to hear a shout out to the dells!
...Why...?
jimmy, you’re fine! end of the line, gaining speed! wrapping trees!
Do McDonald's next
Crazy to see you driving the same streets to get to work in Miami.
EDDY, WHY?!
We need a “Margaritaville Tummy Ache Survivor” t-shirt.
Can't believe he didn't show the hurricane pouring out tequila
cool
Being from Syracuse, that is the funniest most tropical setting to see you fully enjoy yourself at said margaritaville
Give yourself an easy one next time. Go to all the buc-ees!
Eat at every chilis
Looks like the boys are speedrunning alcoholism.
Eat at every McDonald’s in the country.
Shame on you for not dropping an airplane, ‘but I had the fish clip’
Listen I know you said it’s over but listen…. EVERY BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP in the US and Canada
Just wanted to say that the editing is so good! Thanks. Very entertaining
I was so sure at the start of the video, when asking the rhetorical question "Why would you do this insane trip only one year after the rainforest one?" he would response with a deadpan face "Money. I'm doing it for the money. I mean, have you seen the views on that video?" but the cut without a response is even better xD
they have a Margaritaville cruise too!!!
Bad news, Eddy... there's now another Margaritaville resort in Missouri. Looks like you're getting back on the road
EVERY PLANET HOLLYWOOD
Only bimbos eat at chain restaurants  .
clicking on this so youtube thinks i watched it and will get it out of my recommended. it’s like every time i refresh it’s always the top fucking video. i’m not even subscribed. go away.
Please make a recap video with a Q+A!
All the food comes out of tubes . It's crap !
Im more IMPRESSED that you guys actually managed to RUIN a TOYOTA TACOMA 🤣🤣 a Tacoma on a Flatbed is a Unicorn
Lmao you had to go to carousel mall 😂😂😂
Jimmy buffets best music is from the 1970s . Everything after 1980 is for bimbos .
"boom boom sauce" had me laughing
American food chains are so strange I love it
Could be cool to visit all the amusement parks. Though that may be a large series lol
Do McDonalds next
Now do McDonalds
Superb content. Absolutely subscribing
Hard Rock Cafe trip next year?
Hearing you butchered Biloxi made me cringe. Great vid by the way! Greetings from Mississippi
Man screw those handgrenades you drank on bourbon
This video should win YouTube Video of The Year award 🏆
Next up: Bubba Gump Shrimp?
I'm surprised my hometown of Syracuse got THAT much footage
“I Jimmy’d too close to the sun” is now a phrase I will use every time I make a bad decision  Also “The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea” is my new quote im just gonna say randomly
Gotta do every hard rock Cafe now. Id watch that.
Adult rainforest cafe
Next stop: every Bubba Gump in the country
Eddy your brother looks a lot like the king of rats himself charlie day from always sunny . This was a compliment btw
Omg did you come to my city I have a margaritaville 😢

Next up: I Ate at Every McDonalds in the country!
Joe's crab shack next?
I like to imagine if someone were to write a Percy Jackson style series today that the mirrors int he buccee's bathrooms would be the portal to hell
Next on Eddy Burback: Eddy and Ted eat at every McDonald's in North America
I’m just over here wondering why the YouTube algorithm sent me here
I moved from Az a few years back did they close the one in Glendale Az?
dude becomes Harry Du Bois VERY FAST.
Why not rent a comfortable vehicle to drive that far? i owned a Tacoma definitely not that comfortable to travel in. Why would you get like a Toyota Camry or really anything else?
I seen some college students In tuxedos and fancy dresses rent out the entire Syracuse Margaritaville for their senior ball.
The ptsd from rainforest cafe I love it
Map doesn’t show margaritaville at the Ozarks… gonna wait and see if my nearest one does or doesn’t get roasted.
Why the fuck is the music on this so good
That poutine looked revolting, why is it that only Quebec can do poutine right it’s not hard
as an eu human i only know this stuff from south park 🤣
Next you need to eat at every McDonald’s. I fuckin dare you.
Why is Eddy hanging out with like two flagrant racists?
Excited for the Bubba Gump Shrimp video next year
This should become a series!
Honestly the grilled chicken sandwich is always there for bland eaters on any menu. It's like the adult version of chicken tenders so it's gonna be a bit meh
30:15 Look up the "Pretty Reckless", Cindy Lue Who might taste pretty good...
Eddy, this is... Truly... I am envious. I am at day four of a fast. This has been the biggest temptation yet
His mustache looks uncanny
I think he should do Mcdonald next year
Dude ur feet jokes were killing me 😂😂😂💳
What is your secret Brayden 😂😂
Do the Hard Rock Cafe next 🎉
Here's a challenge go to every mcdonalds, no balls.
I’m from Florida and the rain is a constant nightmare every summer.
What’s next, the 14 remaining Hard Rock Cafes?
Facts that Ted and I have the same Buc-ee's Hawaiian shirt brings me immeasurable joy.
One of my favorite museums ive visited was a "worst art museum" in the basement of an old movie theater. It did not disappoint.
Quite the journey. But now my stomach hurts
Now do bubba gump 😂
is your gf single?
Didn't see virginia beach location on map
The fucking mad lad did it
Eddy? Again?

Screw you eddie
So what franchise will you go to next year? :)
Impressive
maybe next time you can eat at every mcdonalds.... it will only take a few years... you got this
I think I did hear a squeak in the door.....
Can't wait for next year when you guys go to every Bubba Gump shrimp co.
I wonder what the guy at the credit card company thought when he saw Eddy charge meals and hotels at every Margaritaville 😂
I loved the gald
Fun fact about the Hemisphere Dancer, Jimmy Buffet was once on that plane with Bono and they were shot at by Jamaican Police when they were mistaken for drug traffickers. Jimmy Buffet then wrote a song about the experience called "Jamaica Mistaica"
Aw you have me such a flash back. When I was a kid we did a road trip to Texas and saw The Thing
Next Year: Hard Rock Cafe
bubba gump next
now go to every mcdonalds
Hey you skipped Pensacola???🤷🏼‍♀️
Can someone do timestamps for each place please?
I love how both channels and both videos have the same intros
the hero we needed the most
I think the British did a pretty good job of making a museum based around “What If… this was ours.”
as a tourist to chicago and niagara falls last year, i wanted to go to a margaritaville so bad but i didnt know how to bring it up on the trip, and now, even after this video, i cant tell if it was a good thing or a bad thing that i didnt go
The Syracuse location was exactly what I expected…
How do you maintain the will to live so weakly yet so firmly?
2,032,884th viewer of this video!
Within 2 days!
You say “the last time” but you’ve forgotten the Hard Rock Cafe, my friend
America is a capitalist dystopia.
He sucks lowkey
Now spend a year going to every mcdonalds in the USA
Every McDonald’s next year
Eddy back doing the Lord's work
Is Cleveland on here? I don't wanna watch the whole thing 😂
And he goes to my hometown I almost cried
The fact my dad worked. At one
There's 1 in louisiana tho
Bubba gumps next?
Touring since the '70s you mean.  Hell, Margaritaville was '77.  Why don't we get drunk was '73.
I ended the Rainforest Cafe video never wanting to go to one again. I ended this video wanting to also go to every Margaritaville
This needs to be a series with you two.   Please.   ALL THE THEMED ROAD TRIPS!!!!!!!
So Jimmy Buffet was an alien 🤔
This is like what aliens who do to experience "the human condition" im high as fuck and i love it. I envy you edward burback. But you put hope in my heart that i, too, can accomplish fucking anything
Isn’t there a Margaritaville in Santa Cruz/Capitola?
"final time" sure jan
Margaritaville are a thing?!?!?!?!? Wow I'm young
there is a new one at southpadre island !!!!!
I kinda wanted to watch this to go to bed bc I’ve never heard of Margaritaville but I liked it so much, I had to stop the video and watch it the next day because it’s so good
Gotta up it to 34 hard rock cafes next year (35 with Canada)
I screamed when I got the notification for this video because I LOVE the rainforest cafe video hahaha
Have you ever thought about doing a life long pilgrimage to every McDonalds in the US?
I have both videos playing, that way I get the true experience of visiting a multimillion business on the other side of the world 😍
have small fondness of the original one in key west as I used to go with my parents when I was a kid.
Next you should go to every McDonald’s in the country, and CANADA!
Can't wait for next year at, idk, like Planet Hollywood or Hard Rock or something
I'm sorry, but as a Brit, the fish and chips was just offensive. Where's the beer batter? Where's the flaky, large fillet of cod? I'm disappointed on Eddy's behalf
Neat
A little sad you didn’t hit the margaritaville at Lanier Islands, but I understand why you didn’t
Where do I go to see Eddy’s feet? $$$
Now do hard rock Cafe
You told us what you ordered.  What did your mustache eat?
Common GA W
She jimmied on my buffet until my margarita villed
Sorry about your Tummy.
You're amazing
Do Bubba Gump next year
Below average or below average for margaritaville?
Watching this as a European, I gotta say this makes the US look even more like a theme park disguised as a country
Excited for next years hard rock cafe tour.. or maybe bubba gump if there are too many hard rocks🤷‍♂️
I clicked on this video thinking "What's Margartivaville and which country?"
ily
Till next year when they do it again 57:26
All the best things come in 3s...
I remember the myrtle beach blender for the margarita hurricane being bigger
Next year- every McDonalds in the US
Billuhxi
cool eddy..... ceddy, if you will
eddy bareback
Kinda embarrassing that Eddy made this whole video without realising it's pronounced Jimmy Boo-Faye
Seeing Destiny USA in a YouTube video from Eddy has me fucking shook ngl
DO BUBBA GUMPS NEXT
I get the stick but this dude has the best life out of the anyone I've seen. I got my soul; sucking job in 12 hours and it'll be a miracle if I dont kill myself this week. So keep bitching about a tummy ache
You guys should go to every bubba gump shrimp in North America
This is your version of the Tour de France.
love the bladerunner nod
Stop doing this! For your own health!
So..... what's the next small restaurant chain for next year. 🤔
Literally what the hell 😭
Daddy Burback rockin that yikes shirt and them yikes jeans, made me go yikes in my pants
I love that youre doing this again. My only critique: I wish you'd explain why you liked the food you ate, the qualities about them that made you like/dislike them, etc. I'm genuinely curious
why is this video strangely feet themed?
52:12 THE OLD MAN AFRAID TO B ON CAM LOL
HDMI cable probably broken on the blue TV
50:31 the child cranking to the rythmn of despair
his tummy hurted and he was very brave about it
This really shows most YouTubers are really just normal people doing things normal people want to do because they have just enough money and support through sponsors they can do these things lmao
Wasting away again in Margaritaville
i thought jimmy buffet was the cricket from pinnochio
The Return of the King (of kitschy chain restaurants)
Yall need some black friends. They would never let yall do this
As a Brit I would like to lodge a formal protest about what they are calling "Fish and chips"
Please make this a trilogy
You're the hero we don't deserve, but the one we need.
You stopped at Buc-ee’s!!!!!!! Good move
EDDY IS THIS GENERATIONS ATHONY BOURDAIN
as someone who frequents the mall in syracuse, I can say that the margaritaville is the saddest restaurant
CLEVELAND OHIO YOU SHOWED TIM MISNY!! He makes them pay!!!
hey quick question - why ? :)
He missed the Margaritaville in Pensacola!!
Can't wait to see Brayden again during next year's road trip video
AGAIN? A-fucking-gain?
That video was really enjoyable and fun to watch so thank you for that 😊 and I really appreciated when you said around 14mns that you didn't film much to enjoy your evening it was nice to hear.
I believe bro forgot the one in Shreveport
I had no idea what's the point of this video so an entertaining hour later I have no idea what's the point of this video.
Looking forward to seeing all the Bubba Gump locations next year.
next year do cheesecake factory
I need yall to go stay in the bass pro shop pyramid
You are doing God’s work. Thank you
you should eat at every McDonalds on the planet next
My moneys on all the hard rock cafes next
45 days also doesn't include the time spent in the hospital recovering from gallbladder surgery
the thing is a family tradition of mine, as we live so about an hour from it. they’ve def revamped it from the old days where it was legit just a hallway with a weird mummy thing. it’s crazy to see such a local museum be talked about 😭
Day 30: ..i fucked ted
You know, there are a bunch of Margaritaville brand bluetooth speakers and shit. You know, just incase you ever hear jimmy calling out to you again.
Bucee's Rubs, Bucee's Nuts is crazy 🤣💀
You’re gonna have to complete the trilogy, Eddy.
Next time you're at the Mall of America, the Wisdom Gaming studios has the best bathrooms in the mall... Just in case you need it
“For the second and *last* time”  Yeah sure
I can't describe the dystopian feeling I got from this video. Boy am I glad I left the US.
I super vibe with you in the Times Square stuff because that was my exact experience. Even the room lmao
as a former Syracuse, NY resident i will predict at least two things to be mentioned alongside the margaritaville; the sewage plant right beside the mall it is in, and the fact that Onondaga lake, which lay behind the mall,  was one of the worlds most polluted likes for quite a moment  after watch update: unfortunate it wasn't mentioned but understandable as who would ever want to dwell on syracuse
Why’d you skip the Jacksonville one??
I wonder if he'd go to every Dick's last resort?
There’s needs to be a sequel to this onboard the Margaritaville Cruise
he suffers for our sins..... again
Rainforest Café is what activates Eddy’s winter soldier programming.
14:00 wow he’s even wearing the same clothes as last time too!!
I live in mpls, I’ve eaten at the rainforest cafe here in the MOA but never the Margaritaville. I’ve only ate at the one in Orlando, don’t think I’ll be eating at the one in Bloomington. Ty for letting me know
better than oppenheimer
Eddy keeps reaching towards the edge of madness and is often on the brink of insanity. And then we got a goofy little guy in Ted
I love how eddy is annoying ted on this one
Final? Eddy? oh... you poor fool... this is the second journey - there WILL BE MORE MY BOY
I The Official Kevin Heart YouTube Chanel disliked that he said driven instead of drove
Eddy and Danny hug spinning is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a long time
Now do the opposite. Try to do a road trip across the US without using any chain businesses
Imagine Fudruckers or Bucca di Beppo next...
Looking forward to watching the Hard Rock Cafe video next year
its  "in line" not "on line", lose that shit son
27:00
Next year do Macaroni grill, there's only about 11.
Now eddy's gotta eat at every mcdonalds in america and canada.
go to dollywood!
Okay hear me out… pull the hangover and make it a trilogy! Hard Rock Cafe baby 34 locations let’s see it next year
Love this vid and the rainforest cafe one! Please release more of the yikes spring tees!
So basically every american food chain in Canada has better food.
Imagine doing Hard Rock Cafe next year…
I might kill ted
I can't imagine how many times eddy must have listened to the Pina colada song, that's my favorite Buffet song
Now do Hard Rock Cafe next year
just discovered this channel.. the voice over is hilarious! will definitely be watching more!
How long until these two reveal they're secret lovers
Up next hard rock cafe
They should go to either every hard rock cafe or planet Hollywood for a mini road trip
glad to see you in destin!
I feel like the ultimate challenge now HAS to be the Hard Rock Cafe. 34 locations in the US, 2 in Canada.
Next year, go to every McDonalds in the country.
That picture with the greenscreen cracked me up omg
Can't wait until Eddy ruins every single restaurant for himself this way lol
Next year: every hard rock cafe! 34 simply rock-n-roll themed restaurants. it would be actual, absolute, full-on insanity and a health crisis for eddy andidont actually wish that on anyone
So basically, Eddy becomes an alcoholic for a few weeks
God, I love chain restaurants.
I feel like this is disgusting 😅
should’ve learned from the rainforest cafe trip
Go to Dollywood!!!
I’ve never heard of Jimmy Buffett before
49:17  The way that "...yeah" just kinda oozed out of Ted, lmao.
America is wild lol
The madman did it again.
notice how the northwest has nothing in it? neither a rainforest cafe or margaritaville.  Why on gods green earth would anybody go to northwest america?????
I love how my beautiful city of atlanta almost ruined the trip because of its notoriously bad traffic
"i've driven 40 hours in 8 days"...  Congrats,  combine that with hauling gear and playing a show and you've lived a GOOD week in the life of an average USA touring musician lmao
omg! i use to work in brickell, miami and i use to see that guy everyday going into work lmfao
I love these videos. The family road trip energy combined with Eddy’s Kenny/Omni-man style dad-stache is perfect.
Next up: every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country
This is so cool
I worked as a prep cook at a Margaritaville and I cannot express how wild it was to hear the jammin' jambalaya get this kind of shout-out. I don't eat meat so I can't speak to the taste, but it took one cook an entire shift just to mise. If you put two cooks on it during the day you could PROBABLY get a batch done. I worked nights solo and I lived in abject fear of the words "jambalaya on the fly." When my shift supervisor checked me out at the end of the night, every time without fail he would open my meticulously cleaned tilt skillet and say "oh no, it's full of jambalaya!" just to watch me squirm. I had a running joke with a coworker where our response to any sort of hardship was to drop to our knees and yell "JAMBALAYA!!" at the sky. It's been almost five years and it is still the stuff of my nightmares. I couldn't have asked for a better final boss for this video.
In before the Bubba Gump Shrimp video
Please do Bubba Gump next
As mentioned at 2:50, “When I was 13 I had my first love,” was said by Ludacris on Justin Beiber’s ‘Baby.’ It was also interpolated by Jakey on his song ‘Moby Dick.’ Jakey then is shown to be with Eddy at 4:06, bringing Jakey full circle back to the location of inspiration for that lyric.
Bro used metamorphosis and turned into a plane 😮
Dollywood vid plz
Absolute comedy gold
My condolences on your sanity, and congratulations on the useless accomplishment
“Going To Every Chedders In The United States”
If I had a nickel for every time Eddy Burback uploaded a video featuring a place that I have eaten at with my grandparents on vacation as a kid, I would have two nickles !
Second and "final" trip you say? Oh no, you're not done burger boy, chop chop, get back on the road
please try a hot dog from every baseball stadium 👍
You abandoned your best friend when you didn’t walk in his shoes. You’re still a POS
biloxi on top💪💪
Seeing this I said out loud "Eddy no..." Then I clicked
go to every Bubba Gump next year!
see y’all at the hard rock cafe next year i guess
As per usual, Canada is superior to the U.S
Just wait until they find out about Dino Land Cafe
can't believe you compared "old me" to "cool me" when "jimm-me" was right there
THE THING IS THE BEST THING IN ARIZONA FUCK THE GRAND CANYON IVE LIVED IN AZ FOR 20 YEARS AND THE THING IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN ARIZONA ITS FUNNY AS HELL
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
So next year is going to be like, old spaghetti factory’s?
Can’t wait to see you go to every Medieval Times in the US… AND CANADA!
I have to see a trip to Dollywood, please I beg
There’s a margaritaville at crystal beach texas it’s new
Patreon for toes?
so ik you’ve pretty much done this trip twice now, but what if you ate at every hard rock cafe in the US and Canada??!
every subway next
I went on that cat in the hat ride, and hours shut down. I was traumatized too. But I was kid traumatized.
You have to make this an annual thing 🙏 It's too good not to
Awsome Video Eddy. However, you Pronounced my hometown wrong, (BuhLuxsi, not Be-lox-ci). you will be fined $2
Torture Tourism
you guys are a beautiful couple i hope you get married soon
Time for a trilogy. BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP
Inb4 Hard Rock Cafe next year
I watched the entire thing just to see the Syracuse location review. Was not disappointed
Who’s gonna tell him about Jacksonville Beach :/
If you really hate yourself next year you can go to every Hard Rock Cafe in America at least every location has a unique location but the same menu
At 26:39 Eddie’s shorts blend so well with his legs that he looks like he’s not wearing pants
would love to see an olive garden episode one day
Huge inspiration
No free feet, but we got some free knees.
The Tulsa Margaritaville is just licensed out to the River Spirit Casino, it's a Native tribal casino owned by the Muskogee/Creek Nation. Been there for ages now, the margaritaville side of it is relatively new.
16:15 omg is it the aliens? haha
No Margaritaville Resort in Lake of the Ozarks?
Do McDonalds next
eddy should go to every bucees in the country....
How do I tag Justin Mcelroy in this?
29:00 does Ted have beef with Drew? Ted didn’t mention Drew AT ALL in his video 🤔 am I missing something?
who paid for this museum?????? i have so many questions and none of them are answered by 'aliens came to earth' lmao
Hard rock cafe next
Hate to be that guy, but there is a Margaritaville in Hawaii. There is also one in the Virgin Islands (though I could let that one slide). Still, your journey is not complete.
Eddy is working himself up to „Every McDonalds in the Country“
Now do McDonald's
The ultimate tax write off part 2
you guys forgot jacksonville florida :(
Bruh not schlatt wtf
What if the hard rock cafes are next? That would take like a year
36:12 "hey liv we work. We do work."
Hard Rock Cafe time?
And you’re doing Bubba Gump shrimp next right???
Let’s all pray to our lord and savior Jimmy
For this and the rfc, i watched both of your guys videos back to back and its truly a well rounded narrative where you see both sides deeply.  Its the flags of our fathers and letters from iwo jima of our generation
medieval times
Glad to know the Margaritaville in my hometown (Tulsa) was good haha. Been to the casino a lot, but never ate there lol.
I pity your liver.
Things Eddy clearly loves: -Margaritavilles -Rain Forest Cafes -Morbius
You guys should do this again but worry Hard Rock Cafes
I saw the title of this and audibly said 'oh god'
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next
okay where do we pay for the toes
Bossier City, Louisiana's Margaritaville Resort Casino was skipped. They just opened a Drago's Seafood in there and that would probably be worth the trip by itself.
Now they gotta visit every Bubba Gumps to complete the trilogy
Nice video Deep Eddy
You should do all the Hard Rock Cafés next,there's only 34 in the whole country!
3:03 more like 1/15 of your year. Thanks for the content Eddy!
So happy that Eddy came to my home state of Oklahoma and didn’t hate it
and here I thought for sure he wrote the do you like pina coladas song, but no. So I dont know or have ever heard a jimmy buffet song.
Do bubba Gump shrimp next year
PLEASE DO HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT
American ambassadors are appointed by the A. Senate B. President C. Congress D. Vice President
Complete the trilogy with Hard Rock Cafes.
Me watching this video: Oh nice maybe I'll go to Margaritaville tomorrow Video: Not feeling good, probably the margaritaville Me: okay maybe not
What about the one in Palm Springs?
So Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. is next right?
I can’t believe America is a real place
Dominican Republic 🇩🇴 margaritaville
What about the Air Margaritavilles?
The only margaritaville I’ve been at was at the São Paulo airport, and I’m from the US. It feels like a bizarre fever dream now
11:05 that is quite the riveting cautionary tale
Eddie doing work for the people. Thank you for your sacrifice.
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next year. Bet on it
Now take the margaritaville cruise 😈
PLEASE do a tour of all of The Cheesecake Factories in the country 😂😭
There is a Margaritaville Casino and Resort in Shreveport, Louisiana!
Do hometown buffet next before they're all extinct
Ted needs to feel a little miserable to enjoy a restaurant, I’m learning
Sorry your first interaction with Cleveland was Margaritaville, next time you're around try Hatfield's or PJ McIntyres Irish Pub
45:51 is that the song for mary
I love it when funny mustache man makes a video about hell on earth
I wanna go to The Thing museum now...
Eddy wanna be a touring musician at this point.
Hard rock cafe for the trilogy?
That random man hyping y’all up “oh shit, the coolest mf” bless that man 😂
Next year - every McDonald’s in America& Canada
Can you do a video about this?
Next do Medieval Times
I can't believe Canada has the best Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville food
i want Eddie to eat at every Dick’s Last Resort in the country and slowly lose his sanity as waitresses force him to wear hats they wrote his flaws on.
The bald man billboard in Cleveland is Tim Misny an attorney. His stuff is plastered everywhere its hilarious.
I stayed at the key west resort for my birthday this year! Purely because it was the cheapest haha but very crazy to to see you guys at the same place I was lol
Bubba Gump Strimp has 34 locations. See you next summer boys
bubba gump next
I saw this video in my feed yesterday while I was in Gatlinburg, TN, and saw the Margarittaville across the road.
what will be next years trip
Waiting for the I ate at every hard rock café next year.
Okay now do Cracker Barrel
i cannot wait for the grand finale next year: going to every bubba gump shrimp in the country
Eddy, please go to every Dick's Last Resort next year!  There are only 13 locations but somebody has to find out what the hell is going on over there.
Anyone else peep Ted's Offcanny shirt?
Did these guys drive after drinking margaritas every day? I will never understand America.
So next year is Hard Rock Cafe right?
i really want jimmy buffet reacting to this
Next year, I vote that you guys do Hard Rock Cafe
This mf claims to have gone to every Margaritaville and doesn't go to the original in Sandusky Ohio and pair it with a cedar point trip. FAIL.
Bubba Gump shrimp next?
Bubba Gump next year?
This might be the greatest series of all time. I expect an other one next year. Red Robin time.
Jimmy was in Epstein’s black book so maybe don’t always do as Jimmy does
The gospel music killed me
I just looked it up and Jimmy Buffet is worth A BILLION DOLLARS!?!?! I’m shocked 😮
There's a whole Margaritaville in Bossier City, LA that you just didn't include lol
Why is no one talking about the green M&M lady LOL
52:00 a thunderstorm literally happened right as I got to this point. If that’s not a sign of something I don’t know what is
Excited for this new entry in the TRCU (Theme restaurant cinematic universe)
you skipped the one in Pensacola

I ate at *ALMOST* every Margaritaville in the Country
You didn’t go to the margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio
There’s def a Margaritaville Hotel in Nashville too but hey I get it
I know this was A LOT of work-  Just want to say, this and last years video are my favorite videos on the internet. :)
it sucks that the margaritaville in vicksburg, ms closed bc that one also had an arcade that was pretty big. but at least mississippi was even included in a video for once 💀
As a manager of a cafe, i can confirm we will do almost anything for a good google review
Syracuse is a great city and it’s been completely ruined by that stupid mall. Sorry you had to go there as your Syracuse experience.
he missed a margaritaville in the U.S Virgin Islands
Im gonna treat the Planet Hollywood sign in the background of the last scene as foreshadowing for next year
there’s also a margaritaville in jamaica, it has a slide that empties out into the ocean
You’re not done yet Eddy… there’s a Margaritaville Cruise
Omggggg you poor thing you did it to yourself again?
Watching the videos back to back really shows the duality of man
Eddy's talking about how relaxed he is... I can't wait to see Ted losing his mind in his video.
Knowing that the Syracuse margaritaville is one of, if not the worst in the entire country is amazing. Watching you walk around the mall I grew up near was surreal.
I wish I had "Pointlessly road trip across the entire country just to go to every mediocre chain restaurant made by a celebrity 30 years past his prime" money
Thank you for offering at 25:44, that even though you’re successful in YouTube, it is still a financial struggle to travel and afford hotels. I really mean that, thank you.
city wok
Looking forward to seeing the Medieval Times one next year!
jimmy buffet looks like jo biden
I'm only learning today that Margaritaville is a restaurant chain...a restaurant chain by Jimmy Buffet.
33:03 You should have stopped in Conway to meet Richard AKA Wingsofredemption for an ice cold Pepsi and a piping hot banquet meal
You guys should go to every Planet Hollywood in America
ted is a sociopath
So when is the next tour
Next video: eating at every McDonald’s in the country
poor kid didn't see it comin. he was not prepared for a 40 year old man to go overboard and obliterate him in a classic game of stinky feet.
no jacksonville fl :(
Just an FYI. Jimmy Buffet/Margaritaville don't own the casino in Tulsa. It is owned by the Muscogee Creek tribe. They license the name/restaurant.
I thought I saw you in NYC earlier in the summer but I assumed that it was just some random guy that looked like you since you are from cali lmao. Probably was when you visited the times square margaritaville.
Eddy should go to every Barnes & Nobles Kitchen. There’s only, like, three now but the fact it’s supposed to be “fancy dining” via B&N is so bizarre that my friends and I want to make visiting them our “Rajnforest Cafe adventure”
You ever consider the reason why you kept feeling like shit was because you were drinking a margarita every day for nearly a month???
Eddy and Ted have the unique advantage to rate or make a tier list of each margaritaville. I mean who can argue with them?
Hard rock cafe next right lmao
It's nice to see how you enjoyed the beauty of the beaches in Destin and PCB - they have the best sunsets and there are so many dolphins! 💙
Now do every Texas Roadhouse
go eat at every mcdonalds
so whats the next restruant?
Bubba Gump’s next?
Supposedly the 'Original Margaritaville" in Sandusky, Ohio claims they were in operation before Jimmy Buffet started his empire.... Trip #3???? 😂
Eddy’s tummy hurts and he is NOT being brave about it
I love this series so much lol
So much driving, so much alcohol... yep seems fine
Them 😂Giving you ribs at night is amazing 😊
TIM MISNY SPOTTED!!!!!!!
Obsessed with the Bean segment. Ate lunch in front of this thing for every school field trip ever for some reason
You guys missed the Palm Springs Margaritaville!
the tim misny billboard is really all you needed to see from cleveland anyways
This was profound.
Do Bubba Gumps next summer
atlanta based
When you ran into that fan in Texas, did he laugh really nervously while saying "yeah what a wild coincidence, I have absolutely no idea how this happened..."
I didn't think anything could be more deranged than the rainforest cafe, and I was wrong.
Wan't expecting the Rainforest Cafe video from last year to get a sequel
There's a Margaritaville in Shreveport though??
Next year, every Cabo wabo
Sooo next year Medieval Times?
take a nice break big ed :)
a wild place to marg your itas to be honest, I think I'd almost be up for a trip like this if I had the time and money to grab a friend and go on a 3 week long road trip across the states
I just wanna know what your bank thinks looking at your charges to only Margaritaville but spread across the entire country in such a short amount of time
i audibly cheered seeing the Tim Misny billboard at their stop in Cleveland
they are living the life I wish i was doing road trips
The thing reminds me of the garbage amusement park place from land of the lost
Vegas strips for Midwest family tourists ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
they just opened one in San Diego by the way 😂
Next year they need to go to every Chuck E. Cheese
EDDY YOU GOTTA EAT AT EVERY BASS PRO SHOP NEXT.
He missed the one at Lake Lanier outside Atlanta, GA. Literally the best one cuz it has a dope water park, honestly an L video because of this
Hard Rock Cafe next year
I’ve been wondering where he’s been…
The slow descent into madness was so real here.
I love how these trips slowly devolve into a fever dream.
Olive Garden,          you know you want it
Bullshit. There is one in Hawaii.
Great video, I could never. But there is one in Shreveport, LA that I didn’t see you go to… not that it discredits your achievement.
Not only do I feel like should have had to pay for this quaility content, but i feel if this was released in theaters it would no doubt rival barbenheimer. This was art.
...o no I think he missed one... there's one at Lake Lanier in GA
I'm only mildly offended that you didn't give the city of Cleveland a little more time....
How could you leave out lake of the Ozarks!? Eddy… Shame!
Medival times next?
Bossier City, Louisiana *Stares Menacingly*
True dedication
Do waffle house next.
Eddy's narration is legitimately some of my favorite comedic monologuing. The timing and rhythm is impeccable
Did not all resorts count? In Conroe TX we have a big Margaritaville resort on the lake and it has a restaurant. So what were the rules exactly?
I just started the video but please god I hope you guys go on the Margaritaville CRUISE!
The Margarita Ville at Destiny is in debt with Destiny and that’s why the place is terrible.
A+ use of Vivaldi's Summer
Im calling it now, next year they're doing Hard Rock Cafe
I hope this is a stupid annual tradition. I hope if you have children, they continue this stupid tradition (when they are consenting age to have their likeness on the internet). This is one of the dumbest, funniest things I've ever seen on youtube and I've been here since Lonelygirl.
The intro tripped me up, so I went to the Rainforest Cafe video and just cackled.
Hoping we get a ‘I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country’ video next year
As a Canadian who actually did go to Niagara for the rainforest cafe after your video I very much appreciate the anthem playing aggressively in the background of the Niagara section
Bubba Gumps has to be next….. right?…… RIGHT?!?
This is going be an annual thing now, isn’t it?
Next years gotta be Medieval times or Bubba Gumps shrimp CO. PLEASE!
I can’t believe schlatt killed 3 people in the margarittaville bathroom
the legend is back
There's a new Margaritaville in Conroe, Texas
40:30 with "did you know jimmy buffet is 76 years young" killed me
Do Bubba gump next!!
Bro is playing the "I'm rectangular" song at 21:10
Great video as always Eddy, but you did mispronounce Biloxi (the O is pronounced like in onion)
You are a fantastic narrator
Could you please do this a third time? I know it makes you miserable but I really like them.
can't wait for whatever you do next year
Me: this is a fucking cult Eddy less than 2 seconds later: this is a cult
Next year do McDonalds
Hard Rock cafe next year?
Fun fact: while on a band trip in high school, my friends and I fell asleep at that plane bar outside Margaritaville.
Another banger video. You're a fantastic story teller and always love you and Ted's dynamic. Now I'm waiting for a every Planet Hollywood video 😂.
Hi Eddy! I’m looking at your Dr. Seuss part of the video and I thought you’d like to know I passed out at Dr Seuss Land once. Don’t worry this isn’t a trauma dump, I just thought that was really funny. Thanks for reading this comment if you did
crazy how many margaritavilles are near rainforest cafes across the united states
Next you gotta do bubba gump 😂
Do DICKS LAST RESORT NEXT! <3 Love These!
pigeon forge is wisconsin dells prime. branson is more like pigeon forge in almost every sense the only real difference is that pigeon forge is higher. wisconsin dells is distinctly more midwestern
Next is Chucky E. Cheese!!
I watched this whole fucking video! This WHOLE video. He got to Jimmy's Jammin jumbalaya and i had to  pause. Jambalaya should be RED. There was absolutly NO seasoning on that mf! it was just beans and rice you ate eddy, my dude.
As a Syracuse native, I'm so sorry you had to go to Destiny.
I reccomend doing this once more    but with The Great Worlf Lodge
Biluhxy is how you say “biloxi”. Gulf coast is an odd place.
So In summary. if you want to have good US chain themed restaurant food, go to... Canada?
“I think it might be tinnitus.” 7:10
You gotta do Johnny Rocket's next.
49:03 hey i pass that rest stop every time i drive to my grandma’s :)
If you want to be just like jimmy buffet then you have to show feet for free
It's so fucking wild hearing a YouTuber go to the city where I live
I feel like you and Kieth from the try guys need to do a team up! Would be pretty sick!
I cant wait for them to do Hard Rock Cafe next year... (only 34 locations...)
YOU GOTTA DO A RED LOBSTER
So what I’m getting is that Canada reigns supreme yet again
now do every mcdonalds
This is truly the Empire Strikes Back of Eddy Burback visiting every location of a mediocre chain restaurant.
I like how in that clip of the smoke directly hitting fans at the justin bieber concert, he's performing "Sorry" 😂
I didnt like knowing the year could be split into 12ths
What about visiting every Dick’s Last Resort next year?
They didnt go to everyone of the m in the US. There is one in Bossier City, Louisiana. Im feeling scammed
Bubba Gumps next??
Cant wait for next year when he goes to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in North America
It's 5 o'clock. Everywhere
Kind of feel like this, the Rainforest Cafe trip, and the Morbius binge could qualify as self harm.
Go to all the medieval times next!
started at the last one i ate at and loved it, only also been to the one in las vegas
I just lost 10 brain cells
Just wait for next year when they go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the USA
Eddy. I thought the Rainforest Cafe bad. This might be worst.
I have 100% been to that Myrtle Beach margaritaville lol that blender hurricane was a buried memory
He has done it again... wow.....
i thought they had said 'the beach' when they said 'the bean' and i was wholeheartedly expecting them to go to the beach, not thinking about the fact that they were in chicago. then they showed up to a weird bean thing and i was genuinely confused
do Ruby Tuesday next. there's not that many
I love the Bladerunner reference at 52:48 lol
So is Bubba Gump Shrimp planned for next year?
Please do every Dick’s Last Resort.
As someone with IBS I would not make it. I would simply combust.
do hard rock next
The funniest thing about this video is that I can legitimately notice how there are aspects of the story that parallel a major motion picture.
when they inevitably go to every bubba gump in the US next year eddy will be haunted by returning to the mall of america and seeing both the rainforest cafe and margaritaville so close to bubba gump
Man is slowly working his way up to eating at every McDonald's in the country.
Lmao i was the waiter who complemented that shirt😭😭😭
Okay but what about the air margaritavilles?
Next year in Hard Rock Cafe!
Next video...Bubba Gump Shrimp
Eddy really helped remind us all… it’s jimmy’s way or the high way in margaritaville
Used to live in Panama City Beach. Fuck that place. Worked at that margaritaville actually. It was ok.... Also, there's a jimmy buffet neighborhood there too.
2049 reference w
Deep Eddy Burback
A pity there's no elephants or sounds of thunder this time.
What about lake ozark?!!!
How many planet Hollywoods are there?
Next video: “I Went To Every McDonalds In America.”
Can we all agree Bubba Gumps is the next series?!?
Wasting away again in Diarrheaville...
Oh wow, Chicago made the Samsung Beans into a real thing.
Wait until they go to every Medieval Times in the US and Canada
Eddy, I'd like to personally thank you for validating my experience on the Cat in the Hat ride. I rode it when I was 7 and to this day I remember the fear and motion sickness I felt catapulting through those rooms with the little blue-haired freaks slithering their onesied bodies around furniture all while their horrific overlord loomed.
Hey Eddy, my man. I don’t want to be that guy but there is one down in the Lake of the Ozarks that you may have missed.
every mcdonalds next.
Anyways next up y’all have t-rex
Ey you should do it a third time
Next, Buccees, it's hot right now.
As many views as Ted has subscribers (1.8M) 😳
“Buc-eel’s rubs buc-ee’s nuts” 💀
So you're gonna do the 22 Bubba Gump's Shrimp locations in US, 1 in Canada and 4 in Mexico right?
why didnt you do benihana
why not order literally anything different each time
Just remember, even Jimmy Buffet gets tummy aches
This is basically the Gen Z version of  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
Greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time.
That's funny, I was also JUST in Pigeon Forge this past weekend, and also not for anything to do with Dollywood (was camping in the Smokies)
GIMME ONE MARGARITA..
17:27-19:30 It's so surreal seeing you visit places from my area. I'm thinking, "I could've met him and missed my shot!" lol
@EddyBurback if you decided to subject yourself to another road trip next year I highly suggest Hard Rock Cafe, and I will absolutely join you!
one time i got stuck in that elevator at that pcb location
I drive by the Biloxi Margaritaville every day. It looks awesome at night when the lights are on.
There is a margaritaville in Bossier City Louisiana
Oh no here we go again
so like is Hard Rock Cafe next? asking for a friend
y’all missed the one in Bossier City, Louisiana!
Do bubba gump next
My question is what on earth will you do next year?
"Second and final roadtrip..."  X to doubt.
Miami is lucky it has nice beaches and shit. Those buildings designs are so ugly.
Next year: I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in the country
These documentaries truly show the human soul.
FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS HOW TERRIFYING THE CAT IN THE HAT RIDE IS!!! NO ONE EVER BELIEVES ME. I CRIED.
Can’t wait for part 3!!
Cant wait for next year’s “Going to Every Walmart”
who's the blonde stranger is basically jimmy buffett's rendition of the piña colada song
So you guys gonna do every Bubba Gumps in USA?
The Boston Margaritaville’s ‘coming soon’ sign has been up forever and every day I pray that ‘soon’ never comes
Cleveland is notorious for having tough to chew chicken
watching this and ted’s video is like a double feature, somehow they made two different stories out of the same experience
I apologize for the Syracuse Margaitaville its so bad
Eddy's por liver
I’m just thinking if you at a party and some random person quotes Jimmy buffet and is like oh just a singer you wouldn’t know….
Next year you should go to every Dick’s Last Resort
You guys should do all the Señor Frog restaurants next! 😂🐸
Not gonna watch another eddy video until he eats at every McDonald's in america
Why is it twice now when you guys come to my state of Minnesota yall are luterally about to lose your minds lol
I watch this for this dishes and literally nothing else, and its the thing you show the least of.
thank u eddy and ted for ur service 🙏
Insane? I was insane once, they locked me in a road-trip , a cramped road-trip, a cramped road-trip with rainforest cafes, and the rainforest cafes made me insane
48:24 You cannot convince me that this isn’t the cover of the new self-titled debut album by an indie rock band called “Commentary YouTubers”
16:57  the unsteady stream  illustrated his age &  experience
Okay so now do Hard Rock Cafe
Honestly Destiny USA is straight garbage especially with all the shootings and stabbings you try to be careful when going there
ted understands that jimmy's vibes are needed/appreciated most in places not typically relaxing. like syracuse, ny.
i liked watching both eddy’s video and teds video
Olive Garden next, surely, there are only 906 locations.
Can you do “I ate at every McDonalds in the Country” for next year?
Eddy is the most reluctant main character ive ever seen.
34:22 "traffic completely stopped" me, an atlanta resident: yup
I don't think the employees at the Atlanta location re-opened just to be nice, they probably closed early even though they weren't supposed to since they were dead and was just goofing off on their phones getting paid to wait till they were actually supposed to close and then you guys turned up. They used to do that at the Subway I worked at when I was a teenager, the manager wanted to go home and we were dead so they'd lock the door an hour early and start closing up that way we could leave right at 5pm and they'd run to the back when they'd spot a customer walking up to the door.
I saw the chair!
eat at every cracker barrel
As an Ohioan, i almost screamed out loud when I saw the Tim Misney billboard (the billboard as they’re heading into Cleveland and it’s just a guy’s raised eyebrows) he’s a personal injury lawyer here in Ohio and he’s a cryptid that haunts all residents of ohio
Do channel members get the toe pics?
Someone uncensor this mans feet
You and Ted are legends my guy. I didn’t think you mad lads would do this twice haha
he has once again come to the mall of america and i missed him yet again. also yeah that corner of the mall is always like that.
Eddy…listen…do what you have been training for. You obviously are doing this like how somebody trains before a marathon….you MUST go to every Chuck E Cheese…all 434 remaining locations…
I expected a worse review of the NYC location tbh, and now I feel I must experience it for myself just to see what it’s about for myself. I don’t know if I want to deal with Times Square though, I’ll have to see if I can drag some friends along lmao
They missed one near Houston 😅
8:30 this is some actual mystery shack shit
now you got to go to all the bubba gumps
thank you so much for transcripting this with name indicators!!!! i’m hard of hearing and have roommates and this makes it soooo much easier to follow!! 💗
I’m a little surprised that you skipped the only Margaritaville NOT affiliated with Jimmy Buffet that is located in Sandusky, Ohio.
seeing all of these places is crazy cause i can’t imagine anything this america-core and tacky
9:47 that is true terror on Eddy’s face
Can’t wait until next year when he goes to the bubba Gump shrimp at mall of America right across from rainforest cafe AND margaritaville.
I bet they go to every Hard Rock Cafe
That kid sucked at stinky feet
why is THIS how i find out my city is getting a margaritaville
Holy crap 1 million views in one day!?!?! great for him🎉
Im a simple man, i see the bean, i call it the bean and say fuck Anish Kapoor
brave men
do bubba gump next
MARGARITAVILLE SANTA CRUZ?? WHERE YOU AT
next: I ate at every McDonalds in America and Canada
and he did it AGAIN for a check😢
Next go to every Wendy’s
Congrats on surviving those tummy aches
I love your use of the Four Seasons by Vivaldi
can't wait for them to eat at every McDonalds
Eddy, again? I feel like you make an endurance test out of these kinds of videos. Just gonna let you know, I enjoy the content you make. 😂
When you pulled up the green screen- thats america my guy
Hi from Panama City Beach, this place sucks. Only thing we have going for us is our beach. Hence the name.
Hard Rock Cafe next year
I want this to become an annual series that increases in scale every year until eventually Eddy and Ted spend like 4 years on the road eating at all 1,231 Chili’s in America
Nothing but respect for this brave Tummyache Survivor 🫡🫡🫡
I went to what must've been the nicest Margaritaville in the middle of nowhere in Ohio like a decade ago. It had full on waterfalls, outdoor landscaping with trees, free-roaming lizards...
like i care
rafferty’s next. there’s only 12. you can do it
34:14 you guys just experienced the start of The Walking Dead
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp you coward! Lol jk
You really need to get you some bucky's beaver nuggets.  They awesome... until your teeth start hurting.
Bravo you crazy bastards.
So is Medieval Times next year then?
Eat at every McDonald's u amateur.
Margaritaville in Bossier City, LA? 👀
It’s “Buh-luck-see” MS not bilocksy🤣
I’m traveling home after work and I know for a fact that I’m driving  on the same road they took for this trip
how'd you go to every single margaritaville and NOT get the best menu item the chicken and broccoli pasta
I’m traveling home after work and I know for a fact that I’m driving on the same road they took for this trip
You said “final” road trip…😢
as a texan, im glad you like san antonio. its probs my fav city in this ridiculous state
I’m from Biloxi, and I’m personally offended by that pronunciation
cannot believe that I actually vacationed at a Margaritaville once
Tummy
Please do Bubba Gump next!!!😂
YESSSSS ITS BAAAAACK
Stay tuned for the buba Gump world tour
Love that the most exciting event on this trip was seeing The Bean.
Ya'll missed the Missouri Margaritaville!
The should do all Hard Rock Cafe next
The one in Vegas is pretty convenient if you need a quick breakfast. And you get so much food 🤤
This is pretty much just a "supersize me" spinoff
Im glad I watched both videos all the way cuz Ted left out whether you tipped in the Atlanta locale
Do every bucees and see if you can escape
They better go to all 34 Hard Rock Cafes in the US next year
ok i am from Niagara falls and i dont think you UNDERSTAND  how happy it makes me that two TWOOOO years in a row that we had the best food rain forest cafe i was proud of BUT Margaritaville tooke the cake thank you for coming to my town and enjoying our food =)
Next year better be “ I ate at every Medieval Times”
Every Bubba Gump in the country next year. The world is begging for it.
my Puerto Rican heart is broken got the San Juan airport crying in the corner 🥲
How to write off food as a business expense.
Ok, so now you have to go to every Ikea Restaurant in the USA.
uncensored feet version when?
You gotta do a sequel with all the Air Margaritavilles
I have a margaritaville bicycle :)
Now eat at every McDonalds in the US.
gotta love that eddy developing a violent urge to kill ted still happens just like in the rainforest cafe video
You’re literally a younger and significantly less depressed Marc Maron
My only regret is that I cannot watch this for the first time ever again
I think Eddy has finally snapped guys. Also, I live in Tulsa, that’s awesome!
You should try Medieval Times next, there's only 10, with one in Canada
Great video! I dare you to do Hard Rock Cafe next! 😉
Edd Burvinsion
Cant wait for next years video where they do all the hardrock cafes!
What about the Margaritaville in Palm Springs?
YESS!!! eddy’s rainforest cafe video is one of my faves ever LOL
Yo do bubba gumps
Well, you made me do it again @EddyBurback @TedNivison , I had never heard if either of you before the Rainforest Cafe trip, and I ended up watching BOTH videos... And I was compulsed, much as you two were to do this crazy s**t again, to watch BOTH Margaritaville videos. I have no idea why this is so entertaining, but d*mned if it isn't, because all 4 videos held my attention the entire time.  For April fools day, you two need to visit "Every 'T-Rex Cafe' in North America"... (The punchline is there's only 1 left, and it's at Disney Springs... And you can spend the rest of your day with your posse at Epcot or whatever 🤣)
Wait until he finds out about margaritaville at sea...
Hard Rock Cafe summer 24’
my favorite video I’ve ever watched
Entrées are appetizers btw, dunno what y'all are smoking.
eat at every mcdonalds in the country
49:05 THE LAKE FOREST OASIS HAS MADE A CAMEO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Too bad the Margaritaville musical wasn't still playing on Broadway while you were there haha
Drunk driving simulator
Jsyk there is a margarita ville in ft Myers fl that closed after a hurricane in 2022 but it’ll be open by 2024 so u will have to go to that one when it opens
Finish the trilogy, do hard rock cafe
I have been eating the same bacon burger with fries everyday at my restaurant for 2 years now (except for maybe 10 days at most were I got mac and cheese/chicken strips). I know most normal people will relate to your struggle eating the same thing, but I just can't. One of my dreams is to be able to eat the same thing everyday while also not dying of malnutrition. I know that's a weird takeaway from the vid but it was a large enough part of the story that it made me think a lot about my eating habits and how I prefer to eat the exact same thing everyday and hate trying new stuff.
You for sure were pulling off that first hat
I used to be an OTR trucker and would see the signs for THE THING every week but never had a chance to see what THE THING was so thank you for checking it out so I could experience it vicariously through this video.   Also I’m from New Jersey so thank you for limiting your commentary on New Jersey to just saying “New Jersey.”
Sadly there are two things missing. In the entire video you never mentioned the term “Parrothead”, which is a devotee of Jimmy and you didn’t go to the Margaritaville Cruise ship at the port of Palm Beach Florida. Come on now, you can do better! Oh, and there are Margaritaville restaurants in Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Grand Turk. Are you ready to island hop the Caribbean for Jimmy?
going to my list of ''things only possible in america''
39:34 When I tell you the picture had me CACKLING AHAAAHAHA
cant wait for hard rock
Bubba Gump
45:07 kinda cute
I can’t wait for the Hard Rock Cafe video next year
best video ever!
Bro I've seen the myrtle Beach margaritaville and I'm sad it was awful. I was vegan at the time (2015) so I never went in 😅
bubba gump nowwww
46:32 THATS MY MAN. HE MAKES THEM PAYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
After going on that Dr Seuss ride as a kid it gave me nightmares
So… When are y’all going to every Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Company?
Can’t wait for next year when you go to every hard rock cafe in the us
hell yeah perimeter footage of the belvidere oasis!
So Hard Rock Cafe is next
51:05 Stockholm syndrome
The bucees you stopped by was in wallers Texas. One of my favorite places to stop by.
I know you said never again but hear me out ............ every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
I feel like everytime Ted was smiling he was crying inside and going insane.
i watched your rainforest cafe video and it became my lifes mission as a canadian to visit the niagara location, and by the time i got there it had closed. if the niagara margaritaville closes before i get the chance to go I'll know im cursed
There's a Margaritaville in Capitola that did not get visited.....
i was hoping he would hone in on the fact that the margaritaville in atlanta is literally a whole water park on a haunted lake
Am I crazy or did they skip the Pensacola Margaritaville resort? smh.
yessssssss Syracuse representtttttttt
Oooo the Biloxi pronunciation.
Puerto Rico has a Margaritaville in the airport and is technically part of the US, just saying.
The sequel we didnt ask, but still needed
hey eddy, next time you come to the mall of america be sure to let me know so i can watch you suffer in person!
Every roller coaster featured in this video!!!!!  Rolling Thunder (SBF Visa Spinning Coaster) at Paradise Pier Fun Park in Margaritaville Resort Biloxi 15:10 The Incredible Hulk (Bolliger & Mabillard Sit Down Coaster) at Universal's Islands of Adventure 29:42 The High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride (Mack Powered Coaster kinda?? this one is debatable if its a coaster or not) at Universal's Islands of Adventure 30:11 Jurassic World: Velocicoaster (Intamin Multi Launch Coaster) at Universal's Islands of Adventure 30:18 Dragonflyer (Vekoma Family Inverted Coaster) at Dollywood (shown on video not visited) 37:17 Thunderhead (Great Coasters International Wooden Coaster) at Dollywood (shown on video not visited) 37:17 SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge (Gerstlauer Eurofighter) at Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America 52:19 Pepsi Orange Streak (Zierer Tivoli) at Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America 52:19 Fairly Odd Coaster (Gerstlauer Spinning Coaster) at Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America, They rode this one!!!!! 52:19
The most important question, how do we pay to see those toes...
Can you imagine if they did all Crackle Barrel…
What’s the music around 15:05 I need this
I'm a little upset you didn't meet the real Jimmy Buffet
I've never heard of Jimmy Buffet (I'm not American/Canadian) and I'm at a loss of words to how this managed to build an empire of chain resturants based around his life style, like what??
So sad Chrissy couldn’t live at Margarita Ville for a month with you:(
You gotta chat with whichever McElroy brother that is obsessed with mister Jim Buffett
Finished the video, now I'm thinking about the IRS agent who has to look at 24 receipts to Margaritaville and put their credibility on the line to confirm that they're an accurate reflection of the cost of doing business.
Looking forward to the hard rock cafe video next summer :)
I like the part where he went to Margaritaville
Next should be every bucc-ee’s
that one alien at the thing store is dummy thick
"I beat the child"  - Eddy 2023
None of the people who were extras in this video lived where I thought they lived. DANNY LIVES IN CHICAGO?
Okay, now do Olive Garden.
next up, waffle house!
My fiancé is from Niagara we went to the margaritaville the week of Valentine’s Day on a random night she ordered the Buffalo poutine for us, 11/10
Disappointed the Margaritaville cruise was not embarked on; guess you need to start over.
This Fucken Madlad! Huge follower of your work!
As a Floridian, I’ve never heard someone speak so highly of Panama City beach
Hate to tell you Eddy, but The Thing is a real body  Went there as a kid and back then the museum was cheaper and just had cheap hanger like buildings.  The Alien x Dino museum wasnt there yet.  The car Churchill was in originally was claimed to be Hitlers car.  It was summer and we were able to smell The Thing before we got to its building
As a mexican I *have to* ask: why do you americans love margaritas so much?
Excuse me where Mississippi?
gimme 1 margarita imma open my legs give me 2 margaritas imma travel to every margaritaville in the us and canada
MINSY MAKES THEM PAY
I'm unfortunately never at Margaritaville or Rainforest Café at the same time as Eddy and I become increasingly saddened each day. There is really no payoff to being a Florida resident. Edit: RIP Jimmy
Came for Margaritaville..Stayed for The Thing.
soooooooo uhhhhhhhh how much for some of dem toe pics there?
Love this!!
Yall should go to every mcdonalds in the u.s, you'd be gone for like a year.
Man and i thought i hated myself.
Thanks
Great hour of content right there.  I think my favorite part was "Oh shit.  Coolest m*th*rf*ck*rs on the planet!" 😂 @eddyburback please tell me that was a random passerby
I hope you realize you’re doing Hard Rock Cafe next!
Was the planet Hollywood in the background in Vegas foreshadowing?
I've never in my life felt like a YouTube video deserved a like based on someone's suffering, but here we are.
Patiently waiting for the Medieval Times road trip
Go to every Subway next
Just commenting for the Algorythm
The rainforest cafe PTSD gets me every time
Oh man I really hope this is an annual thing these videos are absolutely fascinating
Now go to every McDonalds 🫡
Hard Rock Cafe next?
What about Lake of the Ozarks?
i want you to know that we salute you eddy burback. thank you for your sacrifices
48:24 weezer
iii moved to PHX 2 years ago and the serotonin & smile from seeing the metra was real real 🙏👁🙏
ok now eat at every mcdonalds
San Antonio mentioned !
knowing my digestive issues this trip would’ve taken me out by like day 4 MAX
It’s too bad the one in my city closed. If only they could have held on for another, like, 15 years. What coulda been 💔  Edit: It was actually a “Cheeseburger in Paradise”… but still.
Having intestinal issues is actually a great time for an epiphany: there is a reason why the Thinker looks like he is taking a shit
Bubba gump is next!
this is like the modern day fear and loathing in las vegas
46:30 real ohioans know
Next year they're gonna eat an every single hard rock cafe in the US and Canada
22:08 hey so fun fact about the coolest guy who ever lived he actually owns a bar around the city called Miami Mojito Company and just rides around the city doing shit like that every day.
52:49  "now listen to me young man, i am talking directly into your ear now. i need you to do me a favor. you will do this for me. i need you to go to gamestop, and i need you to ask the bastard working the counter if they have bambi on the ps2. if you come back empty handed youll be in big trouble mister. you will never see the light of day."
Next year you and Ted need to hit every Bucees in America.
Again??
Hear me out… next year every Hard Rock Café. It’s ONLY 38…
thanks Eddy
bubba gump shrimp next? 👀 theres 23 in the us
When’s the every McDonalds in the country happening?
what chain will he do next
I took a dump in Margaritaville once. I didn’t eat there, just pooped.
yall absolutely got someones personal dinner in that one margaritaville yall were late to and that makes it way cuter
I want to go to buc-ees now
Congratulations on being one of the top 5 trending!
Did anybody else notice Jimmy Buffet's autobiography had "Fiction" printed on the back cover? 🤔
Now you have to go to every Buc-ee's.
i have never told anyone this, but i did this too, i did this 2 years ago, and got damn, a lot of them were incredibly racist towards me
please visit every buccees in the nation and rate the bathrooms
Im only here because I enjoyed Teds video and decided to watch the other guy
I can't begin to explain how excited I am to see that they finally have the blender cups back after losing their manufacturer contract during covid
If there’s not a third one of these as to complete the trilogy my life will never be complete
Imagine how much cooler videos like this would be if America had a well funded highspeed rail system.
Eddy overcoming a tummy ache on his FIRST day is incredible, one of the strongest men I’ve watched
So... Planet Hollywood next?
now do every chuck e cheese
Tremendous work
That face is the face of a man who's caught red handed guilty of committing 9/11
I absolutely loved the Rainforest Cafe video from last year and this video was just as great. Seeing the nightmare flashback to the RF Cafe in this video was hilarious! I know it would cost you your sanity but I'd love to see this become an annual thing because they are so fun!
I’ve seen the billboards for The Thing many times on my trips from home to college and back again and while a part of me was always curious to see what the so-called “thing” was; I never checked it out and just continued on with my trip.   Seeing this though, I now have the comfort of knowing that I absolutely made the right choice all those years ago. So, thanks!
I need more trips like these each year
Happy to see that even though you almost missed the Atlanta one, they still hooked y'all up with food.
He used to have a restaurant called Cheese Burger and Paradise in Illinois. Was pretty good!
Now you just need to complete the holy trinity and go to Every Hard Rock Cafe
I wouldn't usually comment this, but your girlfriend is a stunner. Absolutely
As a Spencer's employee thank you for telling people not to come in
Eddy: second and final road trip Also Eddy next year: I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the country
as someone who lives 20 minutes away from the wisconsin dells, i can confirm pigeon forge looks very similar
"The world famous game, Stinky Feet"   1. WHY?  2.WHY DOES IT HAVE A JINGLE?
ROUND 2 LETS GO !!!
12:03 that chair is for "them big ol' women down in San Antonio" as Charles Barkley puts it 😂
Idk if its mentioned in the video because im only 5 minutes in but this isnt even jimmy buffetts first restaurant!!! He had one called cheeseburger in paradise and (at least the one by me) was even themed on the outside of the building to match jimmys aesthetic
THE THING!!!!!!! Wooooo!!!! Cochise County, AZ represent
What about south Padre islands Margaritaville??
Stop it. Get some help. But if you don't: 3 simple words  Hard. Rock. Cafe.
ELL PASOOOO ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Love your content, Deep Eddy!
You guys should do McDonald's next year
I can barely eat out because of how sick I get. So yes, I am impressed, and no, it was not a waste of your time
These are 2 of the best videos on YouTube. Which restaurant is next? 😅
Eat at every subway in America next
Eat at every McDonald’s
47:11 has to be my favorite part of the entire video
IF YOU SO BUBBA GUMP NEXT YEAR I VOLUNTEER TO DRIVE
Can’t wait for going to every dicks last resort
Do medieval times next!
There's no doubt that you and your brother are related
jschlatt? yikes is right
At first I thought, oh, Eddy must have reposted this video for some reason. Wait... that's not Rainforest Cafe... oh no.
Awesome - been hoping for another video like this from you!!
This video is an absolute masterpiece...just like the first one
Hope the next video is visiting every DollyWood in the country (I just want to watch you have fun with Dolly)
I just heard two completely different stories, I love it
What if? >;3
sooooooooo...........is hard rock cafe next???
Final? No, do medieval times next
Should’ve swung by Pascagoula, MS (right by Biloxi)! The legendary Jimmy Buffet’s place of birth 💫
cant wait for him to go to every bucc-ees in the country!!!
Strong B.T.K vibes
Why do the location markers look like samus aran
can you do every mcdonalds in the country thanks
being from el paso and having spent most of my childhood in LA, "the thing" was LEGENDARY for us kids in the 915 who made that road trip regularly!! funny enough though, not everyone had seen it... so it was always a "hush hush" type thing. As lame as it sounds, you always felt good knowing you FINALLY got to see “the thing!!” 😂  It filled me with such great joy that you and Ted got to experience it. this made my entire day. lol
again 😂
These are my favorite videos. Thank you for your sacrifice.
Do Hard Rock Cafe next!
Imagine driving through New Orleans and ordering Jambalaya in Minnesota
Why you always eating places?
Hoping for a Hard Rock Cafe Edition.
You don't trust a Blinkley but you'd trust a Schlatt?
As a local and lifelong Tulsa native, I’m sad that this will probably be the only time we will ever be in an Eddy video. On a positive note, at least the casino you went to was pretty cool, huh?
i went to the one in myrtle beach a couple years ago and didn't realize until this video that it is the ONLY ONE with the fucking hurricane on the ceiling
Y’all should medieval times next year
this just sealed the yearly traditional of trying a mediocre restaurant chain for a month long
Now do EVERY. SINGLE. MC DONALDS. IN. AMERICA!
This man is a legend
Are you telling me that a hit song just happens to evolve into a multimillion dollar hospitality empire like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy!
I walked into my step dad watching this and whilst he sat there wondering who the hell these two were I was just with smug joy as I watch Eddy slowly fall into madness once again.
soooo u havent gone to every margaritaville bc u missed the one in lake conroe tx
there is going to be a margaritaville hotel opening in San Diego later this year. so excited to stay and maybe experience the horror that is Margaritaville
go to every chilis
i think u missed the Margaritaville in Lake Conroe Tx
next year do every wetherspoons in the uk 😀
Buc-ee's BBQ sandwiches are sooooo good. Beaver Nuggets + Brisket Sandwich is heaven.
But what about a house of blues or hells kitchens
Imagine using a truck as for a 9000 mile trip. Mpg? That's a yikes
Bubba Gump road trip when
There are 34 Hard Rock Cafe restaurants in the United States as of April 27, 2023. You know what you must do.
Medieval Times next year baby!!!! 🤞🤞🤞😁
Theres only like 4 left in mexico if you want to have visited every Margaritaville in North America
Do every Waffle House in the US
Hi im from Florida and I recently moved to the PNW. The rain in florida is literally insane. But anyone who lives in florida is so used to the insanity they dont realize that its normal for people to hate it. I literally prefer the rain in the PNW
“You clicked on the video thinking : “Is this guy really going to go to every Margaritaville in the country?”  No sir, I watched an hour long video of you going to every single Rainforest Cafe in the country and it’s currently one of my favorite YouTube videos. I clicked on this video thinking: “…wait, it’s not just a song?”
Yes the Cat in the Hat ride is terrifying. When I took my 4 year old twins on it, they had their eyes closed and held onto me the whole time. It cannot be for children.
You said final too many times, and now I don't believe you
Thank you for your sacrifice 🙏
33:07 half the road shots are all these spots of road trips between charleston and myrtle
DESTIN SWEEP!!!!!
17:10 i fucking hate kids
You should do every McDonald’s
Bro ted geekin at the rainforest cafe was so good lmao
Forget about the barbie Oppenheimer double feature the only double feature that matters today is the eddy burback ted nivison esoteric road trip
When I was younger, my family would vacation in Destin and the Margaritaville there was always a place we ate. Seeing it in the video just hit me with a wave of nostalgia.
Ted is a dog, i love it.
This is Jacksonville Beach, FL Margaritaville Hotel erasure.
My man will only touch the wheel of a tacoma.
What about the lake of the Ozark margaritaville
Bubba gump shrimp or we riot
Cool! Hard Rock Cafe next year...
Do McDonald’s next!
Its just as Jimmy Buffet says, "Pave paradise and put up a parking lot"
That dude Braden is stalking Ted. I've noticed him in the background of eight of his videos. This confirms my suspicions!!
Have fun at all of the Hard Rock Cafes in a year.
The weirdest part of this whole trip is that of all the vehicles you could've picked to rent for a 9000+ mile road trip, you guys went with a truck. 🤣
Eddy!! There’s a margaritaville at Lake Lanier in Georgia!! I think you just missed the opening!!! 😮
eddy and ted are an unstoppable force and keith (try guys eat the menu) is an immovable object
eddy and ted are an unstoppable force and keith (try guys eats them menu) is an immovable object
hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe
Go to every bubba gump next
Y tho
Eddy, please, you can't keep eating at every [insert random themed restaurant]  in the country on an annual basis. It's bad for your health!
They didn’t go to the Lulu’s… for shame
Margaritaville did a collab with crocs so you know its a lifestyle
TIM MISNY BILLBOARD!!!!!!! 46:31
Why
Now do planet hollywoods
as someone from AZ, i love the The Thing segment lmao
I doubt this is the last trip. Id put money on an all bucees locations trip next year.
"The Thing" is like the wall drug of the southwest
Now go to every Buc-ee's in the country
Pretty good. Now do Bubba Gump Shrimp
😂😂😂😂
My glasses weren’t on at 26:39 and I thought Eddy was not wearing pants, I questioned how his toes were censored but not the buns
>tfw no margaritaville gf
What about the one in Maui?
I know this is silly but seeing you visit the location near where I live in Tennessee (pigeon forge) was really exciting! People don’t tend to talk about this area of the country and it meant a lot to see someone I enjoy watching visit. Also if you do ever visit Dollywood you have to try the cinnamon sugar bread!! It is literally so good and people go there just to get it!!
There’s a margaritaville resort in Conroe Texas you guys didn’t go to 🧐
do mcdonalds next
I'm gonna go to every rainforest cafe and margarita ville so you guys can't say you are the only ones who have done it.
When eddy laughed in Chicago cause that guy callled them cool makes me so happy lmfao his nose scrunch was so genuine & adorable
14:30 "ted needed the room to get some work done so I went exploring" respecting each others time to jerk off alone is important for bro trips
Getting stuck in traffic in atlanta is a very authentic experience 😅
My brother in christ, the lengths y'all go to create content is wild lol respect
I watched Ted's first nanana boo boo
11:52 I'm glad you at least got to see our classic dinner puddles while you were there
this is my barbenheimer
Honestly witnessing Eddy almost join a cult in this video and then going into Ted’s video and getting the perspective of an outsider helplessly watching his friend go down a dark and terrible path he can’t follow is simply magical.
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next summer?
bubba gump tour next !!! :D
the photo of him alone at the ferris wheel made me die of laughter
next year i vote for every Medieval Times cuz there's only ten but u watch a whole show and theyre pretty spread out so i you could incorporate some cool pit stops to see more of the country
Buc-ees is overrated. Kwik Trip is so much better
Jimmy is so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do Burger King next
Can’t believe y’all didn’t get stabbed in the Syracuse margarita ville
The m&m part in the mall of america reminds me of blade runner 2049
0:15:07 that liminal space though.
now do hard rock cafe :) (please don't do hard rock cafe it will take you a decade at the very LEAST)
I'm convinced the bathroom monkey from rainforest is actually just Jimmy Buffett
Next year is all the  Hardrock cafés 😂
Now do all 24 Ford's Garage locations
As someone who grew up and currently lives in new mexico, the random dog just coming up to you and hanging out is so true
Whats the song at 58:33
crazy to think that Baby by justin bieber was filmed at a mall, in my european preteen memory he was standing at times square lmao
That little kid was so sweet😢 saw you by yourself and decided that’s no fun and came to play with ya!
Jeez you must have pegged a lot of dudes with all those margaritas.
I’m surprised you didn’t end up running into Jimmy Buffett at that point
i love that this might become a yearly thing now😭
Props to Brayden/Braiden for rocking the same outfit as the year before.
This should become an annual tradition
yeeesssssss
As a Biloxi local, it’s nice to see some love❤ we respect your skill at stinky feet
Eddie looks like the kind of guy that would go to ALL the Margaritaville locations
every bubba gump next
Go to every Mcdonnalds in the United states you coward.
So glad you incorporated a shot of Cleveland's newest nightmare landmark, the wordless Tim Misny billboard
As a canadian im so happy it was the best one😁
Ya'll missed the Bossier City, LA Margaritaville! Although you're not really missing out lol
Once again screw Ted
This vid was really great
Hard👏Rock👏Cafe👏2024👏
Every Hard Rock Cafe next???
We briefly had a sad Margaritaville in Vicksburg, Ms (owned by the Biloxi owners which were crooks & got in trouble to where they couldn't legally own a casino so that's why it "failed") that I was a restuarant supervisor at. Very short lived.😅
The next trip should be Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., which includes Mall of America and International Locations!
44:45 I snorted. For those unfamiliar with that store, they sell lava lamps, graphic tees, and sex toys; truly a banging place.
You should do hard rock
11:29 looks like an original brian may guitar and if not, a replica. This man is a queen fan and is obviously being held hostage, someone help this poor man.
Bubba Gump next?
How eddy and teds friendship survived these road-trips is a miracle
can you do a video where you visit every bass pro shop in the country
the way you pronounced "bill-oxy mississippi" kills me. its more like "bill-uxy"
r u gonna do Hard Rock Cafe next
I don't know if you mentioned it in the video (still watching) but Jimmy had a SECOND restaurant chain actually called "Cheeseburger in Paradise" that at it's height had 23 locations across the country. Unfortunately, the chain completely closed in 2020.
Someone need to open an rainforest caffitaville just to spite this man
Y’all gotta do the Hard Rock Cafe next
Very excited for the Hard Rock Cafe sequel
LAST trip like this? hmmm... idk. ever heard of Bubba Gump Shrimp?
Very fun watch. Now do Hard Rock lol
Justice for Cleveland lol was hoping he'd review the flats 😢
next up: every bennigan's including international which somehow exist
The sign above the door didn't have an end quote and that alone drove me crazy, I don't know how Eddy does it.
Holy shit the Tim Misny billboard. Isnt Ohio without it
I think you should keep going!! Pick more restaurants to do this at! 😂 I’ll watch
Livin like Larry
I wonder if this series will increase the overall quality of the chains. You do a really good job of saying which locations put in effort into their food. Might have to go to Niagara Falls just to try Rainforest and Magaritaville
You have to do this one third and final time now. We need to complete the trilogy. See you next year. 🫡
Gonna be totally honest. I had no idea who Jimmy Buffet was until 2017 when Game Grumps' game, Dream Daddy, came out. Ever since then, it feels like Jimmy Buffet and Margaritaville are everywhere I turn. I can't escape him.
52:51 "You look lonely"
YES' another video like this you will never know how happy these make me.
Now go to every McDonald’s in the world.
Mad fucking lad
I live in Pigeon Forge, so I spent half the video excited to see how you portrayed this cryptic tourist hellzone. Specifically, I was excited to see if you mentioned something that I affectionately call Ass Monkey, which you showed the front of at 37:27. I call him that because from the back, you can only see his ass, which they made caked up for some fucking reason. Just because it's funny, I've made it my personal goal to make all of my online friends see it in person at some point.  It was also just wild to see someone I watch be in my area and show footage of it, shit's nuts  Also, the entertainment center thing the Pigeon Forge Margaritaville is in is called The Island. It shares a tram system with a convention center, the Leconte Center, which hosts an anime/gaming/cosplay convention called Yamacon every December. My favorite part of going is seeing all the Margaritaville tourists stuck on the tram and forced to look at all of the cosplayers. Almost all of them look at the cosplayers as if they need to be crucified. I recommend visiting the area if you want a show like that lmao
y'all are insane i love it
Both eddy's and Teds videos made Trending. It was a beautiful site
Next restaurant marathon: Going to every McDonald’s in the country
Now you have to go to the Margaritaville in Montego Bay, Jamaica
i love how this trip went from "rustling jimmies" to "emotional epiphany" in the span of a month
Lmao, the one in OK being a casino is the least surprising thing I've ever heard.
Eddy hitting traffic on I-20 is the true ATL experience
Alright see you guys in a year for another road trip of self reflection and regret!
halfway through this video I realized that eddy was going to develop the same unhealthy attachment to jimmy buffet that he had to the bathroom monkeys
Dare you to go to every McDonalds. No balls.
EDDY WAS IN NEW ORLEANS AND I DIDN'T KNOW
go to every dinner show in pigeon forge lol
Bought the Margarita shirt to get closer to Jimmy Buffet
That bladerunner music....also ..now hard Rock coffe
Bubba Gump's
*FUN FACT: There's a Margaritaville in the movie Jurassic World with a cameo of Jimmy Buffet running in terror (So, looks like ya missed one Eddy!)
this makes america look so awful
Cool now do medieval times
Next year shal be a road trip to experience all Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament Locations!
Why did you do this?
I officially recommend hard rock cafe with 34 locations for next year's road trip.
I'd love to travel back in time to the 90s and do this in the UK but with Little Chef - the shittiest motorway diner you can imagine, and I miss them so much. They were in the most random places sometimes too.
Funnily enough they did miss some margaritavilles
This video is a testament to the adaptability of man when faced with consistent food poisoning and relentless sloganeering.
Are there enough Planet Hollywoods left to do this next year?
Great content as always! Looking forward to Eddy and Ted visit every McDonalds next time!!
Cant wait until they go to every bubba gump in the us and canada
Interesting how you didn't go to the Margaritaville in Palm Springs
not just Binkely ....T. Binkely......which means the T must be an even dumber name if he decided to go with T. Binkely
Amazing
Hey Eddy, this wasn't mentioned in the video, but there is a Margaritaville in the US Virgin Islands. Unless you were just staying continental 😅
my mom actually worked on painting the Cat In The Hat ride in Orlando!
for the second AND FINAL. IM WAITING ON A DAVE AND BUSTER RUN
eddy Bareback
This is so weird. I had a dream with Eddy in it last night. I apparently met him twice but he was shaven and I wasn't sure if it was him and so i went up and I asked "Are you...?" and he responded "Eddy Burback? Yes" and for some reason I busted out laughing in my dream (genuinely on the floor laughing as he walked away) because he was shaven to the point where I didn't recognize him TWICE.  I don't understand why that was so funny. I've only watched like 3 videos of Eddy so far... (rainforest cafe, ghost kitchens, and this)
LMAOO i used to absolutely HATE that cat in the hat ride as a kid. and then they make u sit thru it all for so long bc the ride moves so slowly lmaoo nightmare nightmare
Who the fuck is Jimmy Buffet?
https://youtu.be/RAA1xgTTw9w
Now you must do all the Bubba Gump Shrimp locations next year
Cant wait for your trip to visit every medieval times!
im not kidding, I live for these type of videos. Thank u Eddy <3
Cheesecake Factory next. Two months.
Kinda seems like you need an AA meeting
You guys should go to every Bubba Gumps. They have a decent amount in America but also REAL international ones. Good excuse to do some traveling, can write off some vacations as business expenses when it comes tax time
i kicked lamantin once
“Is it important for the overall trip? No. Is it important to me that you knew this? Yes.”
I think for the sake of your health, you best not do this again
So this means Bubba Gump is next, right?
As someone from Tulsa, I’m glad you enjoyed our Margaritaville but as someone that’s done a few gigs there for parties the smell there always gets me lol. Every time I’m there I feel like I’m walking through clouds of cigarette smoke the entire time, can’t stand it lol
Next restaurant: Bubba Gump
Jimmy Buffet
How many Chuck E Cheese restaurants are left ? Lol maybe next year
I love bucees! Glad to see it on a video lol.
Bro missed the others
The Justin McElroy experience
Eddy how much for toe pics
God I love these please dont stop making these videos! Maybe the next one could be like visiting all the giant food statues or the weird museums in the USA.
This was all foreshadowed by Ted getting that margarita in Disneyland. I just know it.
Bless your soul for having to spend a night in Shreveport Bossier. From a local. Oh no you didn’t go to the Bossier LA margaritaville. This video is a lie.
Time for hard rock cafe
I was just at Margaritaville Times Square on Sat. We went to eat after seeing Aladdin on Broadway. We have been to the one in Orlando and i loved the Jambalaya. Go to Manhattan, ordered it again and it was disgusting. You are so lucky you got the heads-up. I wish i did. :(  LOL
I fucking love margaritaville
"I beat the child" -Eddy Burback 2023
idk what i expected from this but it was not to see a tim misny billboard
You should do eating at every McDonalds in Germany next
OK now EVERY Hard Rock Cafe in the US (and you HAVE to visit the National Aquarium for the one in Baltimore (Inner Harbor), they're just next door, and the aquarium is absolutely BEAUTIFUL.)  EDIT: There are... 35 locations, so you'd actually want to go at it this way:   Honolulu (idk if you wanna go to tht one, you'd have to fly) Hollywood, FL Hollywood on Hollywood Blvd San Antonio Houston Airport New Orleans Orlando Tampa Tampa Airport Key West Miami Atlanta Nashville Pigeon Forge (Hopefully this time you can go to Dollywood) Myrtle Beach Washington, DC Baltimore (PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD VISIT THE AQUARIUM I SWEAR ITS A GREAT DATE NIGHT) Philadelphia Pittsburgh Cincinnati Atlantic City New York Yankee Stadium Niagara Falls, NY Niagara Falls, Toronto, Canada Foxwoods Biloxi Northern Indiana Chicago Memphis Seattle Denver Las Vegas San Francisco Sacramento  I tried to make it as accessible and easy for you guys as possible but yeah here you go :)
jordan adika margarita thirst trap jumpscare
I feel like Eddy is gently but persistently testing the bounds of his friendship with Ted.
wait is the margaritaville in capitola not a real margaritaville then ??
48:24 Weezer.
I'll see you guys next year with the Hard Rock Cafe video 🫡
We stan buddy the gestation dog
so who ever this jimmy buffet is opens a restaurant and it's not even a buffet?
Bro went through the five stages of grief
I got culture shock watching this
Amazing  Inspiring
There’s a margaritavile in Palm Springs guys 😔
you should do the yellow deli next
I’m shocked you guys didn’t go to Lulu Buffet’s, the sister restaurant.   There’s only 4 locations in the southeast, but the food is (somewhat) better since Lulu writes cookbooks.
You're building up to do a Hard Rock Cafe tour... I know it
PLEASEEE go to Dollywood
I love tax write offs. Do you love tax write offs?
Gotta do all Bubba Gump Shrimps locations next!!
“I feel like that name is a little too confident, and after tasting it, I was erect” -eddy
"We went to Atlanta" *TRAFFIC* Yeah welcome to Atlanta Eddie this place it over filled.
Every waffle  house  in the country try that
Margaritaville in Jacksonville FL would like to have some words :(
I can't wait for Eddy to go to every Chili's restaurant in America.
one must imagine sisyphus happy
Rainforest trip: nearly went insane  This trip: joined a cult
I look forward to your " eating at every Bubba Gump shrimp in the us and Canada" video next year!
“I beat the child” - Eddy
Syracuse is the opposite of a tropical city. Therefore their Margaritaville must be the opposite of good. This is basic science.
I’m the Lego employee you met at MOA, so glad to see the video!
I didnt know you were friends with Jarvis!
Going to every margaritaville in the country wasn’t the crazy part, choosing to do a road trip in a Tacoma was
You should go to every Bubba Gump next.
next video :: i spend 50 days of my life and did the impossible; all the rainforest and the margaritaville in the country. cant wait for that documentary about two mad lads doing the impossible.
now do bubba gump shrimp company next ;)
This is my all time favorite video. Thank you for your sacrifice, Eddy ❤️
I don't comment much at all.  But this is the best Video I've seen since Filthy Frank Videos.  This was Epic.  Could have been 2hrs. Absolutely loved it and made me want to do this.  Do an Australian Series, Mate. You'd love road tripping OZ to see every Giant Object we have.  COME DOWN UNDER NEXT YEAR!!!
TED!? 9/11!? SAY IT AINT SO
Omg I was also terrified of the cat in the hat ride but when I went it was absolutely EMPTY. I was the only one in that ride building and on that ride at the time. I just went because it was a ride with no wait but boy that freaked me out
Hard rock next year
i love this series i love it so much
Now do every mcdonalds
These videos were fucking insane. Truly classics.
You should eat at every McDonald’s in the country for your next video.
Margaritaville has a place in my heart. In like the 8th grade for our band trip we went to the one in Orlando, and my dad, being the cool dad he was came with. Our group was basically the reject group (I was a loser by band kid standards) and after we won our competition, everyone was like “WE’RE GOING TO MARGARITAVILLE” and like booking it. My dad was like. “Uh, no” and basically flagged down the rig Shaw bike guys and we took two. Got there BEFORE the crowd. And left while everyone was waiting. Needless to say. Jimmy Buffet and my dad were my hero’s that day. Also I’m sorry that Pigeon Forge is the way it is, locals hate it too. (Am I local. The only good thing we have is Dolly Parton, you’re welcome society)
"And on the next episode, we visit every Panda Express in the United States!"
you HAVE to do every bubba gump shrimp in america next!!
FINS UP EDDY!
wow, cant wait for pt 3 of this series
The day after watching this, I saw a guy on the street in NYC with a Margaritaville T-shirt. My eyes and mind have been opened. Thank you
Please restock the Spring Flowers Crewnecks🙏
This is the content I dream of. Excited to see Ted's enthusiasm and Eddy's slow descent into madness.
Yeah, traffic just does that in Atlanta
Amazing video eddy seriously. Now do bubba gump.
This video hasn't even been released for over a day and I'm on my fourth rewatch. I've been listening to margaritaville at the gym on loop for an hour. And I woke up from a nap where me and my family went to margaritaville for 21st birthday. But the worst part? I'm not 21 yet so I can't get a margarita in margaritaville 😭
I had no clue there was a Margaritaville in Cleveland, this may be the best day of my life
There's a cool chain of restaurants/hotels in the PNW called McMenamins that gives you a prize if you visit all their locations
Every bubba gump in North America next year
There's one in Bossier City LA. I'd get upset about you not really visiting every single one in the country, but man, Bossier/Shreveport SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS so I don't blame you.
Next year you should try all the McDonald's in the U.S. and Canada
They're back
12:20 Let's be real, we all saw this coming
TIM MISNY
Every Hard Rock cafe
Hard Rock Cafe or Medieval Times needs to happen I'm so sorry.
Damn that kid sucks at Stinky Feet
I went to the one in Myrtle Beach when I was a kid during a vacation
The most authentic Atlanta experience you had was getting stuck in traffic was on the way to Atlanta😂
12:08 might just be my favorite bit in this video
Eddy: eats fried fast food every day while chasing it down with several sweet alcoholic drinks also Eddy: My tummy hurts :(
i had a dream once where jimmy buffet told me "it's pronounced buffet" and then I woke up
Yknow whats funny theres another Margaritaville in Jacksonville FL.
How did you not know your tummy was going to hurt eddy
There is a margaritaville resort in south padre island in Texas, but perhaps it opened after the road trip ended
Enjoyed 😮
Thank you for checking out The Thing, those billboards have been haunting me for years but not enough for me to pull over and check it out
How many Casa Bonitas are there in the US and Canada?
From a former buc-ee’s cashier: only enlightened buc-ee’s take
I’ve only been to one Margaritaville. The one in PCB and also sat at the bar. Convinced it’s actually the only way you can visit it
As a Tulsa Oklahoma native your welcome eddy and Ted
But what about Ed Debevic's?
Hands down my favorite video you’ve ever made. I loved the rainforest cafe video but this one went so above and beyond. Hell yeah Eddy!!
Can't wait for next year's video of every hard rock cafe.
You skipped the Jacksonville Beach Fl margaritaville location /:
Bubba Gumps shrimp has to be the next adventure!
I went on the Cat in the Hat ride at Universal Orlando over and over again as a kid. I thought it was so fun cause it use to spin you around so fast!
I don't like the part where you start to turn on our lord and savior jimmy
As someone who drives into Atlanta to do anything fun on weekends, Atlanta traffic nearly ruining everything is on brand
Can’t wait for “I ate at every hard rock cafe” next year
As a native Tucsonan I have been driving by the thing signs for 20 something years. I'm so happy you guys stopped to show me what was in that dang place! Now I don't have to EVER! 😂 Thanks Eddie!
Is Ted trying to kill you? Or move you into misery?
For the last time? What about a tour of Hard Rock Cafes?
So… Hard Rock Cafe next?
anyone notice at 52:11 when the guy behind eddy hid his face?
You've inspired me! Next year I will be doing a cross country trip to every Bubba Gump's across the country. If you plan to do your own trip to all of them then I wish you luck but I will be turning the trip into a full documentary. You will 100% be attributed with the inspiration
26:29 is the moment you became a card carrying Floridian
Excuse me! Yall did not go on the Margaritaville at sea!!!
I live down the block from the Hollywood beach one, and it’s so much fun on a Friday night and Saturday night with the bandshell next to landshark
Now do McDonalds
I hope they give that bartender and manager a huge tip for doing such a big favor, thanks to them we got the full experience ❤
Eddy nobody made you do this twice. But im glad you did, this is what it means to be human
There’s still T. rex cafe…
what you did not know the plane outside the restruent in unvirsal is jimmys acuall plane. there is even bulliet holes on it.
Planet Hollywood next? ……
next year we’re gonna see every Hard Rock Cafe
14:32 As a native Mississippian the way you just butchered the pronunciation of Biloxi hurts my soul.
The staute of liberty holding the crazy margaritas was definitely my favorite part.
Omg i knew you got to cleveland before you said so bc of the huge Misny billboard 😭
is there more out side north america? cause u def shoulda said the world
I’m so scared for you when in 20 years you go to every single McDonald’s.
This has to be a trilogy
The guy in Chicago who hyped you and your brother up during the photo shoot 😂
I bet even Jimmy himself hasn't been to all the ones in the US. You think he would go to Syracuse, or Bloomington? 😂
NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE IN THE WORLD
Gotta do Bubba Gumps next year. Only 22 restaurants in the US
Eddy did you know that there’s also a Margaritaville Broadway musical? I was supposed to see it in 2020 but. Well. You know
Do McDonald’s next
Now you have to do the Aquarium restaurant.
My god they’ve done it again
8:31 peak American road trip experience
y'all missed the Margaritaville in Jacksonville, Florida. time to get back on the road...
yall should do the medieval times next year
Glad you enjoyed stinky feet, I’m a game tech at the Biloxi location.
Jimmy Buffet: You look lonely, I can fix that...
It's always so strange hearing people from other states talk about Bucee's as a Texan. It's just such a fact of life while road tripping here. 😂
I can’t wait for next years video “I Ate at Every Bubba Gump’s in the Country”
I loved this
So uh... Bubba Gumps next?
How much have you drank in the last month?  Eddy: “Yes.”
This is all gonna be building up for next year when they hit every Hard Rock Cafe in the US (33 i think?)
Best. Sequel. Ever.
These are the most beautiful films I’ve ever seen you have to make it a trilogy. Possibly Hard Rock Cafe?
My favorite part about these two videos (aside from the sanity depletion) is that you can't play Margaritaville at all because you'd get demonetized.
It’s such a shame that Eddy’s knees went to his head and now he charges people to look at his feet.
Glad to see my fear of the cat in the hat ride is a shared experience.
Do Olive Garden
The rainforest café video was… last year? What
go to every mcdonalds in america next year
Love this series! thank you for putting yourself through this for us.
52:48 blade runner vibes
Do McDonald’s next. I dare you.
I think they’re building another one in Fort Myers, FL as well!! THE TOUR IS NEVER OVER
Hey man, let us know if you feel like your wasting away again.
where's anthony
Fun Fact: Jimmy’s plane in Orlando also still has bullet holes from one time he was shot at by Jamaican police when his plane was mistaken for a drug smugglers.
Disappointed that around 36:00 you didn't say "another standard margaritaville eating another standard maegaritameal" missed opportunity there bud.
WHAT ABOUT MONTGOMERY TEXAS!?!
Next Year: Going to Every Bubba Gump Shrimp
They just put on a jimmy buffet *Musical* in my home town’s summer theatre. This man is somehow everywhere and nowhere at once
Atlanta Traffic is classic
Now do all Hard Rock Cafes in America
Bro you need to get a hotel sponsor to pay for this trip. for u to visit all their hotels. And make them hire a bus driver to take u and ned to all their locations
My mother is one of those people obsessed with Buc-ees. The only photo on my phone I have of her genuinely smiling is when she was standing next to the Buc-ee mascot performer
Next up: Bubba Gump
Every American Hard Rock 2024 incoming
The Cat in the Hat is an absolute terrifying nightmare experience.
the cat in the hat ride is terrifying
Excited to see you and Ted go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in the U.S next year!
Is it bad I think all the food looks really good?
"the coolest guy that's ever lived" in miami bikes through the entire city almost everyday doing that stuff and blasting music having the best time ever
wonder if theres gonna be a vodka named Eddy 9 pin
hi
All of these people from around the USA commenting, "As a person from blank..." is so cool!!!! Great vid
I love right by the thing and I'm happy people are embracing our culture
the guy who met you last year KILLS ME
why did you not go to the margaritaville in medford, oregon?
As someone who lived in pigeon forge I never have been to margaritaville. Do I dare go?
Awesome!... Now go to every McDonalds in USA and Canada
love seeing a funny YouTuber visit a horrid tourist destination in my town
I feel like Ted’s enjoyment of a restaurant is tangentially related to how close a rainforest cafe is to him
go to every hard rock cafe
Jimmy Buffett is literally the DJ Khaled of the 1970s
This is the most amazing content on the entire YouTube platform
I had no idea margaritaville was an actual restaurant or even a song; I just thought margaritaville was a vibe everyone felt and accepted that
it has been done
cannot wait for the 3rd and final trip next year eddy, these hallucinatory nightmare double features from you and ted are legendary
Why have i never ever even heard of margaritaville
What about the Margaritaville Cruise!!!!!
Was really waiting fir the revelation that Margaritaville is actually about a man drinking himself to death.
Can’t wait for the “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe” threequel to this series  Edit: my disappointment is immense because I just found out my Hard Rock Cafe comment is not unique
ok now do hard rock cafe
Tulsa is an interesting place no doubt wasn't expecting to go to that margaritaville I live 5 minutes away from it wish I could have got to see you even tho you would have been barely alive 😂
nice video edward
Ahh, another excuse to monetize your vacation I see!
Do Hard Rock Cafe next.
How many Planet Hollywood's are there in the US and Canada?
Did you not count the margaritaville resorts?
Can't wait for the Hard Rock Cafe trip
Hopefully Eddy’s next road trip is sponsored by pepto bismol.
do great wolf loge.
I’m from Myrtle Beach, and i’m glad you guys didn’t get to stick around long. Shit sucks bro
Edit: Soooo you skipped the one in Lake of the Ozarks? There are slides there. A swim-up bar. What the heck my dude.   This is crazy to me because after your Rainforest Cafe video, I told my cousin, who is OBSESSED with Jimmy Buffet, that we should do this exact road trip. Except we call Jimmy Buffet “James Buffet” (pronounced like the all-you-can-eat style of restaurant).  PS Whenever my stepdad, Eddie, is at the Lake of the Ozarks, which is every weekend in the summer, he transforms into Cool Eddie. Awesome to see you also transform.
Omg I have stopped at the Thing museum as well
I love the really amazingly wholesome Manager and Staff moment who went above and beyond and created a very happy memory for two bros on a strange quest.
Man has rainforest Cafe ptsd
15:58 almost expected Jimmy Buffet to pop out of the volcano
coming next year "Going to every McDonald in America and Canada"
I watch Ted video and as a myrtle beach local, i'm happy you point out the hurricane machine in there that traumatize me when i was 4
Now it’s time to go to every Hard Rock Cafe
Very weird knowing both Ted and Eddy came to Tulsa my home town to a restaurant I didn’t know was in my home town
Next trip: I went to every bubbagump shrimp in the country
Youre so funny and handsome. Thank you for being u!
Hate to break it to you boys but there’s actually one at the lake of the ozarks in missouri
can we all just take a moment to appreciate that intro, like gave me chills what the heck
Now I'm mad. You guys both went to the margaritaville in Niagara falls the same day I was there. My mom and dad wanted to go there but I got drunk at the restaurant next door and wanted to go back to the hotel. Edit: I'm glad you guys saw one of the tim misny billboards lol
You should do HardRock cafe next
not only will they never get back the time they spent doing this, but it is also life lost because the food is 100% killing them with every bite taken.
Can't wait for the next trip next year Eddy!
Eddy never seen a rez dog before 😂
ahhh when he asked ted if he wanted to go ti the rainforest cafe made me smile so big oh my god
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next year!
as a brit that fish and chips is the saddest fish and chips i've ever seen
I watched your rainforest cafe video (it actually was the first video on your channel I watched) and I LOVED the redemption arc of rainforest cafe. Your channel is a balm of humor during the challenging days of pandemic and my regular job (hospice social worker).  Please make these videos more, like all of X manageable chain.  Keep of the good work and eat something healthy!
This is the most intense case of the Mondays I've ever seen
You GOTTA play more Stinky Feet
I genuinely thought my first viewing of this video would be as a jury member.
can't wait for your video going to all the hard rock cafes 👍
"can you let me digest-" "nah, fuck that. cmon."
Y’all need to make this a thing every year. Next year…Bubba Gump Shrimp
I absolutely love these and i wanna do this trip
This madman did it again
Please do buc-ees next
Next video: Getting a high score at every Top Golf in the US & Canada
Why does your girlfriend hold her fork like that?
Can't wait for the "I ate at every Dick's Last Resort" in the Country" and "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country" videos
I hope that next year they go to all the hard rock cafes in the US and Canada
26:56 was me when i stayed at an all inclusive resort in Cancun right on the beach 💀 why think about stuff when you can be on the beach?
danny looks too young to be drinking margaritas
ted is me instead of becomming miserable in a bad situation i go straight to happy manic 😂
Omg im so excited for this
So I’m a scenic painter and the theater I work at just preformed the awful musical “escape to margaritaville” and then the company got covid SO WE WERE STUCK IN MARGARITAVILLE TOGETHER FOR NINE WEEKS STRAIGHT
Bubba Gump next
As someone from the Pacific Northwest I am floored I’ve never heard of this chain and the resorts???
The best part is he actually missed at least one location in Texas.
what about the weekend Margaritaville cruise to the Bahamas
Eddie. Why.
Do bubba Gump next year
thats atlanta alright!! a lot of awesome people combined with the second worst traffic in the US
I expected to click this and watch you slowly go insane drinking sub-par margarita's across the country. I did not expect to watch you walk through a museum filled with busty aliens riding dinosaurs. I can't say I'm shocked nor disappointed though.
cant wait for the sequel and the end of the trilogy next year
Air Margaritaville in San Juan, Puerto Rico: Am I a joke to you?
You’re just a shill for the big Jimmy industry.
frick, you should try riding the orlando eye when you have a fear of heights and all of your friends trying to shake the car.
give me one margarita imma open my legs 🎶
glad you only pictured yourself at the beach in myrtle. there's a reason that people round here call it dirty myrtle
You gotta do either hard rock or Cracker Barrel next year
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
Hard Rock Cafe next? There are only like 165 locations in 74 countries.  For real you could do all the ones in a certain region or maybe all Bubba Gump Shrimps in the US and Canada?
Well the lyrics are literally "wasting away again in Margaritaville" so I think this experience was appropriate.
North America is a nightmare
Cleveland having only 45 seconds in this hour long adventure is very deserving in every possible way
That one store was so insanely cool for hooking you guys up after closing time
Now go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
See ya next year for Hard Rock Cafe
Eddy, no. Stop. No.
That fact that the intro is basically note for note the same as the rainforest video is a funny touch
I can clearly see the emotional and physical toll these videos take on you, but damn they are so entertaining
Im convinced that ted loves pain🤣
2024: I went to every Toby Keith’s “I Love This Bar And Grill” in America
A Perfect Margarita is just like aPerfect Manhattan which uses both sweet&dry vermouths It’s  blanco AND reposado tequila with both triple sec AND curaçao (Cointreau & Grandmarnier usually)
im just mainly offended that a jimmy buffet restaurant isnt a buffet.....
The Rainforest Cafe one was fun to watch because that's one of my favourite restaurants. I've never even seen a picture of the inside of a Margaritaville. I'm *really* looking forward to this
wasting away again
28:30 The trauma, the ptsd. I'm so sorry Eddy- atleast that shit was entertaining as hell.
The bean is suppose to be a drop of mercury from the sky
okay anything i said previously about this video being not good, ALL OF THAT THROWN OUT THE WINDOW THIS VIDEO HAS FUCKN DREW GOODEN IN IT IT IS AMAZING
As someone who grew up going to Dollywood and Pigeon Forge in general, definitely go back there, there’s so many hidden gems and the Island alone is a super cool place! But Dollywood is incredible, the rides, stores, shows, heck even the food is top tier, it’s a must go!!!💜
Fake news. You didn’t go to the one at the Miami airport.
I can’t wait for next year when you guys hit up every single medieval times.
I love Buddy, please make more videos of Buddy
i watched teds video and it was better
2022: Eating at every Rainforest Café in the US. 2023: Eating at every Margaritaville in the US and Canada. ... 2030: Eating at every McDonald's on Earth.
What happened to the Margaritaville in Conroe Texas?
Here me out… going to all Bucces or Hard Rock Cafe
I'd kill to have a friend who would go on an insane one month long trip all over the country of USA to try food from a particular chain restaurant in all it's locations. I don't know what I would do if I found out they wanna do it again, I think I would just marry them honestly.
Last time we were in Buc-ee's I lost my husband in there, but since we share our location with each other on Google Maps, I was able to find him with it. Yes, it's THAT big.
Up next is applebees
You say second and final. I'm not sure I believe you. You'll be back. ;)
I’ve gotta tell you these videos made my month
Road Trip Three: Visit every Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament (there are only ten!).
I never expected the villain/redemption arc of Rainforest Café.
now you have to do bubba gumps next year
if you do this next year, I think the only place to go is the Hard Rock Cafe
Another awesome video!  Can't wait to see if you do it again for Planet Hollywood lol
The margarita like icons on the map look like little samus icons lol
You GOTTA do Medieval Times next. The shows are 2 hours and there’s only 2 different meals you can get… That would be a true test of your strength. (Also I’m a bartender at the Atlanta location so come say hi lol)
I love how this broke you two in completely different ways. Thank you for sacrificing your sanity for our viewing pleasure.
Next year: Hard Rock Café world tour
What about the Margaritaville in Capitola, California?
39:16 is this shot a preview to going to every Dicks Last Resort in North America.
Wait until he finds out there is a Margaritaville in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
Youtube was invented for videos like this.
Proud to know that my margaritaville was the worst one!! Go Syracuse!!! 😂
22:10 bro witnessed the real Florida Man 🤣
Tell ted to go to all the tecas roadhouses
You should do Dicks Last Resort next year.
You actually missed one Margaritaville in the Detroit airport in Michigan so...
Ok now you have to go on a margarita cruise. I think it’s necessary.
Love watching eddy and Ted's videos back to back
NYC is such a dump.
Dear god, this is truly a fever dream. Literally the worst trip I can imagine.
imagine not going to the air margaritaville restaurants at the miami and fort lauderdale airports 🥱🥱
I can’t wait for the Hard Rock Cafe tour next summer
the eddy and ted margaritaville videos are the best double feature since barbie and oppenheimer
There are 22 Bubba Gump locations in America… just saying
Have you really done every Margaritaville in the country if you haven’t boarded the Margaritaville at Sea cruise in Palm Beach Florida……? 🤔
You guys have to make this a trilogy! Go to every Bubba Gump next year!
I'm from florida and the rain is in fact terrifying to drive in especially when it reaches blinding levels.
I GOT SO STARTL:ED WHEN HE GOT TO BILOXI AND SHOWED THE OUTSIDE AND ARCADE IVE BEEN THERE I LIVE NEAR BILOXI I HAD A MIDDLE SCHOOL FIELD TRIP TO THAT ARCADE ITS SCARY !!!
Bet you won't do every McDonalds in the country
MORE!
Hard Rock Cafe. It can happen again
loved the Rain Forest video, I am here for more!
This is an American Hell, made just for us. How lucky are we.
I thought Jimmy Buffet was an investor 😂   Wait, I’m thinking of Warren Buffet.
Wow, did I miss you when you came to my town?😮
If eddy decided to do videos on  exclusively US roadside attractions, I would be a happy man
going from the end of ted's video to the beginning of this one sure is something
Now every mcdonalds
Im from Mississippi and have been to the Margaritaville in Biloxi i mostly played galaga lol (Also Biloxi is prounced biluxi
Can’t wait for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co road trip
My brother lives in Florida. My family and I stay in Hollywood which is down the boardwalk from the one there. I want to stay there now.
Can't wait for the boys to take a trip on the Margaritaville cruiseline
As a Floridian, seeing that storm let me know EXACTLY when y'all came through lol
They built one of these by my parents house and the grand opening was during the dead of winter (negative five degree day) in far North America. I worked at a shop nearby and saw they were having a special on frozen pina colodas and frozen margaritas. They lasted about a year and a half
I helped produce the first set of commercials for the Pigeon Forge Margaritaville years ago. We also did work for Paula Dean’s restaurant and we have a solid picture of her kicking my coworkers ass in pinball up in the “Jimmy Suite” in the hotel. We later flew a drone into the fountain. Fun times.
I'm so sorry I derive such laughter from your suffering, great video though!
The only one I've been to is the Myrtle Beach branch. I assumed the big hurricane was at every location
Ted has Stockholm syndrome for Margaritaville. I hope he recovers 🫶
Big mistake not doing BOTH cheeseburger in paradise and margaritavilles
Chuck E Cheese next baby !!!
One of my mom’s friends bought a place in the Margaritaville retirement community… pretty sick
Hello  fellow suburbian outside of Chicago!
11:33 ain’t no way! They gave you frozen box fillets! 💀
This is an amazing achievement especially considering that I'm not strong enough to even finish this whole video.
so obviously the hard rock cafe will round out the trilogy
I hope your tummy is doing better!
50:06 nice shirt! Got my husband the same one a few years ago in Punta Gorda!
Think Ted is naturally disposed to becoming a Parrothead. He has pre middle aged Parrothead energy
I had some Margaritaville sandals. They were wonderful.
Holy shit
You'd think with 9000 miles to go they would rent a hybrid
Can't wait to see every Hard Rock Cafe next year.
look at it this way: you only get one life and you spent a little over a month of it eating at every rainforest cafe and margaritaville
They didn’t go to the one in Missouri😢
Im so glad he did another one eddy videos are actually some of the best u stg
This is awesome love this. loving going through the country seeing different places, people, and how food taste.
I swear I saw someone else go to the thing museum. I thought it was this channel but it must have been somewhere else.
I have such terrible travel anxiety but watching Eddy and Ted just go for it and do these absolutely crazy trips gives me the confidence that I too, will be able to just go out into the world and relax without any worries one day, just like our lord and savior Jimmy Buffet. You guys are fantastic thank you for your sacrifice.
Damn not the Eddy was ever really unfit but bro’s waist to arm ratio looking damn good
Soooooo Hard Rock Cafes next?
Can't wait for next year when they have to stop at a rainforest cafe and a Margaritaville before going to their final Bubba Gump Shrimp Company of their journey.
A grew up about an hour away from Syracuse, NY and.... yeah it's all like that.
Eddy... I know it sucks and feels shitty... But you can send the food back... I promise. You can be apologetic and they'll be nice about it.
The only next logical step in the themed restaurant saga is eating at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 34 locations including 4 in Mexico, 3 in Japan, and one each are in the Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada and Qatar.
Take a drink every time Eddy says "Me" "My" or "I"
LOU THE MANATEE 28:50 love that man
Third round next year!!!!
Next year go to every Mcdonalds in the US and Canada!
omg were those dolphins or were they orcas, the fins looked more curvier than a dolphins :0
Cool that we got to learn Deep Eddy Burback’s full name in this video
cool now do every mcdonald's in the world
What about the margaritaville in the Miami airport
I only been to the one in vegas
you haven’t lived until you’ve been traumatized by the cat in the hat ride!
47:10
Very entertaining.  But if you want to REALLY impress your viewers, you and Ted should eat at every Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in the U.S. (468) and Canada (10).  It would be a multi-year road trip that would end in murder/suicide.  Imagine the views!
The feeling of nostalgia washing over me as I see the myrtle beach margarita ville that I visited as a child
I'm sorry but this was pretty souless content. Just a Rainforrest Cafe part 2, and bashing a perfectly adequate establishment meant for mindless fun, which hurts no one.
Eddy pronounced Biloxi how it’s spelled…smh
Low key Eddy is one of the best storytellers on YouTube. Thank you for your dedication to making us all smile. OKAY NOW DO CHEESECAKE FACTORY! Hear me out, yes there are 187 locations, but there are 250+ menu items, so you can eat somethin new every time.
You know if you did every Bubba Gump in the United States you could go back to Riverwalk, Times Square, Biloxi, and the Mall of America.
I've been to the casino in tulsa before but never actually eaten at the margaritaville inside, eddy saying it was actually good makes me want to try it
If you don't make your new motto "I am the king of stinky feet" I will never subscribe.
bucee's rubs bucee's nuts
You're a hero.
Imagine staying in Austin and waiting until PCB to bring up Deep Eddy Vodka.
Honolulu location suspiciously missing
Please go to every medieval times it is the best restaurant and best themeing
DO HARD ROCK OR BUBBA GUMPS!!!!
what if they went to every Medieval Times next
Idk why I always both watch teds and Eddy's videos
This video sent me down a rabbithole about my local Margaritaville and the fact that the real restaurant is technically called "Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville" and that I've been living a lie.
Watching this after both eating and taking my ADHD medication, which has a side effect of appetite suppression, I could really connect with his feeling of discomfort when looking at the food.
Next year they should do bubba gump shrimp
THE GREEN M&M hahahahh 53:00
Bubba Gump next?
Next year you should go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the world.
"I beat the child, I am the king of stinky feet" - Eddy Burback 2023
You have to try the Margaritaville at Sea next.
21:58 fins up baby! ☀️ 🐬
pretty sure there’s a margeritaville in the detroit airport.
Next year planet Hollywood?
Next Trip: Go to a Texas Roadhouse in every one of the lower 48 states.
the margaritaville brand tequila is waaaay to sweet. tastes like statutory rape. weird how ya took a sketch from the birthday boys and put yerself through that. twice
That’s awesome! I was one of the faces on the billboard on the Tulsa margaritaville! This video was great! Thanks for getting my face out there brother! 👏🏾🥹
this makes me so happy
The US is truly like another world
Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. is next... it must be
Can't wait for the trip to Bubba Gump next year.
Next you should do every Mcdonald’s.
Glad you covered THE THING. Saw all of those billboards when moving from San Antonio to LA and didn’t bother to do the exhibit (although the Dairy Queen there hit the spot)
No no Eddy you're right I'm from Florida and driving in the Florida summer rain sucks and everybody goes too fast in it.
Next year you guys should do every Hard Rock Cafe
Go to very McDonalds in california
If I had a nickel for every Justin Bieber reference in this video, I’d have 2 nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice.
It’s not over i need y’all too do another restaurant next year
Damn guess I will awarding Eddy an Oscar for the second year in a row
46:32 haha
Hard Rock Cafe when?
I'm glad you guys had the true Atlanta experience at Margaritaville, traffic and all.
I have to ask, at 44:08 I too got locked in a hotel bathroom in New York City while touring around the country for something unrelated. Was this the Royalton Park Avenue hotel?
1 day ago yes!
I was hoping a huge Jimmy Buffet statue would rise out of the volcano.
Wow Good one as this....❤❤ https://youtu.be/XK5qiExLHvQ
I would've actually requested that you eat at every Cheeseburger in Paradise, but they all closed during the pandemic.
thing 1 is the demon under your bed and thing 2 is the monster in the closet
As a Louisiana native, I have to do my Deep South duty and correct your pronunciation of Biloxi. It’s said like BILUXI, with a U sound not an O :)
The only time I have ever been to Margaritaville I also left with extreme stomach issues so I can understand this
I went to the Margaritaville in San Antonio while high as a kite off an edible last year and I gotta say, Jimmy’s Jammin Jambalaya and Lava Lava Shrimp hit different when you’re baked on the riverwalk
Buddy the true mvp
Wait, but did you not have a mermaid in a blender?! I would be so disappointed if you never got to see any of their weird little shows while eating.
Stop doing this to yourself
Now Margarittaville and Rainforest Cafe in the same road trip
You should go to every McDonald’s in America next
all of my friends live far away so i also free weird doing things alone - but maybe next time i see a ferris wheel and im alone ill go on it instead of going home - thanks :)
Reminder that the names Ted and Eddy both come from the name Edward. So Edward and Edward went on a trip together to go to all the Margaritaville's in the country and Canada
46:31 as an ohioan i'd like to thank you for featuring our beloved Tim Misny. His billboards are literally everywhere and it is usually just his eyeballs or him riding a motorcycle.
Growing up in East Texas I always thought there was just the Margaritaville casino. Then moving to Houston I learned about the Margaritaville resort. Now I’m learning that there are all these Margaritaville restaurants?!
Eddy is just traumatizing himself one giant restaurant chain at a time
I used to have a co-worker who loved Margaritaville, had her own patio set up and the whole bit
You know what they say: comedy comes in threes.
Now BUBBA GUMP
Alt title: Becoming Jimmy Buffet.
Round 3 needs to happen…. Which massive corporation is next? 🫡
5:29 Jakey?
The fact he missed the Osage Margaritaville
Every great wolf lodge....
Hour-long, 30 minutes into the video and it is now about how burnt out and stressed you are due to your poor planning.  The Jimmy lifestyle is all about leisure and you ruined it by doing this like a past-his-prime traveling salesman that is going to be fired if he doesn't meet his quota.  44:00 Jimmy doesn't do that, he does the OPPOSITE of that.  All you had to do was puff a spliff, drink rum out of a coconut, and get a sunburn from passing out on a beach to "get it".  You completely sterilized what should have been a really fun trip and it makes me pity you and your 1.5 million subscribers.   I do congratulate you on punching WAY above your league on the button-challenged little lady; unfortunately, she seems equally challenged by shoelaces which may explain how she ended up with you.  Try to slow down and have some fun, you're going to give yourself a coronary.  Peace
Now do every McDonald's
TIM MISNY CLE REPRESENT
Why of all vehicles would you rent a truck for a road trip? Why not an SUV?
alright, now do bubba gump shrimp
How can I get Caitlyn Rae to watch this video? She'd absolutely flip out.
Omg next year you can go to the Cheesecake Factory
Hey fun fact, there are 34 bubba Gump shrimp company restaurant in the country. Just saying.
Did you miss the one in Capitola???
Eddy loves seafood but doesn’t want us to know
We need a grand finale of going to every Bubba Gump Shrimp location
Fins up!
Crazy they ran into Danny Gonzalez twice in one trip.
Man I need to follow your socials so I know when you do something like this in my area again
I’m barely five minutes in and I’m already losing it at the tummy ache. This is a masterpiece
@EddyBurback new challenge: go to every Buc-cees in the US 12:51
If you feel like humiliating yourself next year, you should do Bubba Gump Shrimp
Little do the boys know, they will be doing another pointless but entertaining road-trip again next year
I cannot wait for the inevitable “I ate at every McDonald’s in the country” from youtuber, Eddy Burback and his more handsome brother!
Pls go to Dolly Parton’s Stampede, it’s country medieval times where you root for the north or the south.
this is the most american video I've ever seen
WTF I'm paying you for your feet pics by watching the video. S C A M
Alright now do Burger King
The river walk sucks balls
My thoughts and prayers for your tummy. That's the best I can do. Stop asking.
as a syracuse native who has eaten at the margittaville there. yeah haha, accurate
next video: eating at every chilis in the country
Y’all should do medieval times, theirs 9 American locations with 1 Canadian location
A Hard Rock tour is next, calling it.
10:17 no, you're just lying to yourself. The river walk is tourist trash lol! But I'm glad you liked San Antonio!
I am so excited to watch this
Finally. The Sequel.
17:28 I lived near there for 5 years! That wasn’t always a margaritaville, it used to be a local burger place owned by an Asian family
Thanks for the Margaritaville liminal space nightmares
just started the video how many times will he say "wastin away again in margaritaville?"
This is cinema
Hell yeah Jordan slayed in that merch
day 1 of asking eddy to do medieval times next
I'm always confused when Americans call their main cause an entrée, it's a french word and it means the dish served before the main course.
More! I demand more corporate chain restaurant content!
seeing eddie in Biloxi is so funny and also hearing eddie pronounce Biloxi is so funny
capitalism is fkn weird
you two should go to every mcdonalds in the us next year!
Blade runner reference at 53 minutes?
So, I’ll say what we’re all thinking. I can’t wait for next year when we get to watch them go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the county.
For your information I always have self reflection when I have diarrhea
14:06 I heard there was a house there
All I can think of when I hear people mention Jimmy Buffet is his appearance in the aids episode of South Park lmao
I'm guessing that next year will either be Hard Rock Cafe or Bubba Gmp Shrimp Company.
Every Chuckee Cheese's in the country!!!
this video helped me fend off a panic attack! thank you so much for making it
Every Ted's Montana Grill in the country!!!
Ok, now do bubba Gump shrimp
TULSA BABY LETS WIN BIG BABY LETS GO TULSA #1
12:41 I heard there was a house there
I just went through 1000 google reviews of the Atlanta margaritaville and you did not leave them a review, Eddy. Why you no leave review, Eddy? Why you lie, Eddy?
If you spend a month doing this every year, that's 8% of your life!
These videos are SO INTERESTING from an Australian perspective. I’ve never been to the US and have no idea who Jimmy Buffet is. I can’t explain to you how bewildering the US looks from here.
I loved it when ted did it, I loved it when you did it, fantastic work. I hope you've been fairly compensated for your trials and toils
Glad Tulsa had the better menu for ya buddy
When I was a kid we went to a restaurant in Florida that wasn’t a Margaritaville but it did play Jimmy Buffett music and all the waiters danced when it played Fins and I like to consider it an honorary Margaritaville
Shoutout to the Atlanta employees for saving the day
but even the bean couldn't stop my tummy from hurting 😔
Online ceramics merch on eddy 😍😍
The way you pronounce biloxi is so funny to me. (I live in Mississippi)   It’s Bee-lux-sea
54:00 Hey that's me!
I bet 20 monopoly dollars this will not be the last one of these they do.
Schlatt definitely looks like a dude named Schlatt
There’s a new margaritaville opening in Fort Myers this year….
Eddy. Eddy, you can't stop now. Come one Eddie. You know there are more mountains to climb Eddie. More chains await Eddie. Come on Eddie.
So every Hard Rock Cafe now
Really should rent a prius or another hybrid for the next one of these. Just think of how many more margaritas you can afford when you cut your gas costs in half!
Please eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next!!
Imagine having to convince a Floridian to drink alcohol and have fun....mention that you're paying
The thumbnail doesn’t have the one in my city shreveport, so I already know the video is fake
We got to see another side of Ted in this one. In the last one he was always chipper and thrilled, and this time it was clear there were moments getting to him. I guess Rainforest cafe is just more his vibe.   edit: Ted has swung back around, it's a christmas in july miracle
Brayden is literally wearing the exact same fit he was wearing last year. What a legend
-1million health points
Pls do a part 3 next summer!
I imagine this is what being on a cruise ship is like with the additional positive that you can actually bail if you want to.
My cousins wedding was in a margaritaville, it was actually really classy
The Tim misney billboard
So Hard Rock Cafe next?
I’ve never heard someone so perfectly describe the Wisconsin dells 😂
Time to try the Applebees challenge
Aw that one Margaritaville is so nice
May god rest your soul
Epic
Would you consider going to all the Bubba Gumps in the US? 👀
Oh, man. This video was amazing. The amount of work you guys put into this is impressive.
i’m genuinely surprised that you liked the food in miami because usually all the bayside marketplace restaurants suck so bad 💀💀
I wonder where they’re going next year
Shit of course my home town Syracuse had literally the worst one smh
Can someone do a drink count
I’m not the only person developing a crush on this guy am I?
evert madonbal next
Almost full audience viewership! Hell yea, Eddie! Great job!
Take a shot every time Eddy looks at the camera like that Willem Dafoe meme. It's what Jimmy would want
Calling it now: Next Year’s video will be Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.    Rainforest Café has 18 locations. Margaritaville has 22. Bubba Gump? 34.
Great vid eddy
excited for every hooters next year!
Do McDonald’s next year
it's margaritaville cruise time now eddy!! :)
so next year are y’all going to go to every hard rock cafe
OH HELL YEA.  37:13 lemme tell ya. Every time we go see family in Tennessee, we always go to Dollywood. It’s definitely your average theme park, but it’s still fun to go. 43:44 TEH BOYS
Misney makes them pay! Everyone from Cleveland knows!
Best YouTuber 🏆
Now, go do every McDonald’s in the USA. Bet you’ll forget all the trauma from Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville
What about the one in Bossier LA
22 Bubba Gump Shrimp locations in the U.S. See you next year pal.
I didn't know you were from the Chicago area. Represent brother :)
I Can't believe they played Margaritaville instead of Volcano when they had that Volcano Alert.
NOT AGAIN NOOOOOO
#1 on trending omgwow eddy look at u go
i know these videos involve a lot of pain and suffering but they're genuinely some of my favourite videos ever made. thank you for your service, eddy!
yall really chose the worst time to come to florida, it's been almost nonstop storms for a couple months lmao
Never even heard of Margaritaville and if they're coming to Boston I still wont know anything about them. Even after watching this video my brain would just automatically delete the information
Now you should do all the Hard Rock Cafes
about to walk into work right now but, because of jimmy, im cool as a cucumber. Rock on.
I really wish you included more than one shot of the cleveland one it’s in a really nice area on the water with a great restaurant and bar scene and i’m always curious about the inside. the joke of it being cleveland and showing the trash was funny but i was hoping it would be followed with anything else about that location. it seemed to be the only one without commentary
So the next trip is the Guy Fieri restaurants right?
Brayden had a glow up fr fr
The Cat in the Hat ride is like the boat ride in the Gene Wilder Wonka movie
YOU CAME TO MY TOWN AND I MISSED YOU? Well damn.
cannot believe i’ve set foot in the same margaritaville as you eddy
Foreshadowing clearly shows that Planet Hollywood is next, Hard Rockers you’re gonna have to wait I think I cracked this one open like that pistachio
Went and stayed at the Hollywood margaritaville hotel back in March of last year had a fun time with some good food and a killer margarita
35:55 Eddy and Ted experience and exhibit the nine symptoms of combat and operational stress
Can't wait for the inevitable "I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country" video next year guys!!
Sooooooooooo, series finale with the Hard Rock Cafe next summer?
I just started playing Exoprimal so that Alien Dinosaur museum was so surreal
she buffet on my jimmy the way my ville turned to a margarita
THANK YOU FOR GETTING IT RIGHT AND SAYING THE MALL OF AMERICA IS IN BLOOMINGTON AND NOT MINNEAPOLIS
every native atlien looking at the atlanta traffic like ahh… life.
As a Brit I'm fuming about those "fish and chips". They weren't even chips! They were fries! The fish should be a war crime
Medieval Times next
so when are you guys hitting up the hard rocks and/or planet hollywood
a true heros journey
What is the anthem of the USA
How does your tummy feel now Eddy? You're the Morgan Spurlock of our generation.
55:29 OH MY GOD YESSSS MY FAV PLACE AGAIN
when the video cuts to parts of the rainforest cafe video i like to think of it as a reference to the japanese anime one piece
I had no idea Jimmy Buffet was that popular in the states. I only know him as the guy who did "AIDs burger in paradise" in South Park. Also only know Margaritaville as another South Park reference.
Ted did 9/11 for sure
I'm sure the dolphins have cash app
Margaritaville also has a musical play that is touring currently
First, I want to say I truly appreciate the gastrointestinal assault on yourself that you're doing for our entertainment. Second, it's pronounced "Bil-uck-see." (Source: I lived in the next town over.)
another d ay another banger
Im curious as to the total costs of all this
GO CANADA!!!!!!
definitely should do planet hollywood next year!!
The real test would be every McDonald’s in the country, or maybe Joes Barbecue and Foot Massage
This is gonna happen again isn't it?
Bucca Di Beppo next please
Do Guy Fieri restaurants next! Haha
I can’t even explain how I’m so glad you made this video
Next video: "I ate at every Cracker Barrell in the country"
I think this video unlocked my repressed trauma of the Cat in the hat ride at universal studios
The cat in the hat ride used to spin you around pretty aggressively too. They had to tone it down. So you didn’t even get to experience it’s true horror.
I hope Jimmy Buffett sees this 🍹🦜
What about the Margarittaville Resort in Palm Springs
There is one more resort by him call compass by margaritaville right before a small island by my house in Florida that you guys didnt go to
Ted totally got Stockholm syndrome.
So…hard rock cafe next year?
please i’m begging do another video next year
Next go to all the margaritavilles in Jamaica
I lived in Syracuse and I ligit thought that the Margaritaville there closed a while ago.
Did you guys skip the Pensacola Beach Margaritaville??
Are you ok Eddy? I have real worries.
At 33:46 they gave you a classic sloppy Sammy
now to wait one year for “i went to every hard rock cafe in the country”
So… now it’s time to do Hard Rock?
It's amazing how he was able to build an entire empire out of one damn song! So that's all you need, huh? Gets ya thinkin'.
Next trip Eddy goes to every McDonald's in the US and Canada
44:43 - Every mom after their kid takes them in there cuz they want a t-shirt
I waited my little brother's entire life span, waiting for you to post... this.
ladies and gents he did it again   against his better judgement
Watched the Rainforest Cafe vid… I’d have to imagine Margaritaville has got to be better experience
This is actually great advertising. I'm from Europe, theres neither Rainforest Cafe nor Margaritaville. But I wanna try both now 😂
this is sick it reminds me of super size me
The first vacation my fiancée and I ever went on, warped tour in Atlantic City. She told me that she had eaten at Margaritaville before so we decided to eat there. About 45 minutes later we were at the land shark bar right across the street, I then proceeded to get the worst food poisoning of my entire life, ruining the entire vacation.   That’s my one and only experience at Margaritaville
5:14 Wait wtf that burger is half your daily calorie intake
26:32  POV: eddy just gave birth to you
Next year every McDonald’s in California
I clicked this, saw that it was 58 minutes long and went "No fuckin way I am wathing a 1 hour video about Eddy going to every Margaritaville" and then 58 minutes later I feel like I never want to go to margaritaville.
Hard rock trip next year
HARD ROCK CAFE'S NEXT
"The day you have self reflection is the day you have diarrhea?" is now a phrase i hope to ask someday
Now do every McDonald's in the US and Canada.
deadass lost my virginity to towards the end of this video, i made him stop so i could put on Ted's video after yours ended. we love jimmy buffett.
Im visiting the US for the first time later this year. I will absolutely convince my friends to go to margeritaville with me
Has no idea this was made by jimmy buffet, though it was by some wine mom that love margaritas. That other wine moms love to drink and hang out at. Aka my favorite vibe
Isn’t there one in Hawaii?
random but does anyone remember cheeseburger in paradise? that was my favorite restaurant as a kid but they’re all apparently closed down now:(
The sequel we never knew we needed and dont deserve.
Should make a sequel next year and go to all the Margaritavilles in the Caribbean.
https://youtu.be/6VoGLEqC9cM
1/10 there were no rainforest café's
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next
you didn't... drink a margarita at every margaritaville in the country? you for some reason went for the food? okay? why would anyone want to watch an hour of this lmao.
Hard Rock Cafe 2024!!!
Next year they gonna do hard rock
the tim misny feature goes crazy
I hope that Braden becomes a recurring person
My 13 year old son and I aren’t the same person.  I watch Eddy first, he watches Ted.
What about the one in Conroe, Texas?!?!
Now eat at every McDonalds in America
Skipped Bossier City Margaritaville...
I hope Jimmy sees this honestly
That 4 year old child was, in fact, Jimmy Buffett.
not ted buying merch of the thing museum
okay now do medieval times
Ted and i have matching shirts now
Eddies life is now eating shitty food and traveling around the country, and I love it.
At 43:00 just as you said “This was a sign from jimmy that I hadn’t gone far enough” I got a Jimmy dean ad and it fucking killed me
dear god the platter was 2000 calories???
Just when I thought life couldn't get any better I saw this video
Honestly, fantastic video, but what an insane concept. I always wonder how people who do videos like this survive, because I can't even even eat take out two days in a row without my stomach being mad at me these days. I can't imagine doing it for a month. I'd be on a toilet or in bed dying every day.
Wait there's a Gatlinburg Margaritaville too
somehow eddies videos about those restaurants-roadtrips exactly describe how i view the usa. some random country singer, ugly restaurants, the same food over and over... an alien/dinosaur museum in a desert its alle there!
Utterly bodied by the fact that Eddy is one of the few internet personalities not from Louisiana who pronounces "New Orleans" correctly but somehow created a whole new bonkers way to pronounce "Biloxi."
I had no idea Margaritaville was own by Jimmy Buffet. There is one in Cleveland where I live and has been on my list of places I’ve been wanting to go and try the food.
I know this is mostly a comedy focused video but I am really happy you enjoyed the Florida Keys. I grew up going to Key Largo and Key Ẃest every summer and they're some of my favorite memories as a kid
The Sequel I didn't know I needed
You know how as someone gets hypothermia they start to feel warmer? That's the vibe I get from Ted arriving at the mall of america
I love these road trips, because it's so artistic watching two people express themselves in such different ways despite enduring the same trip lol
Okay so whats next?
Margaritaville is trash compared to Pina Coladaburg
I saw the title and just said out loud - “But why?”
I appreciate the fact that in editing he timed him saying "I have faith" to the Market Street lights turning on at 40:13 I seeee what you did there Eddy
You are something else .
Bubba Gump Shrimp next year
Every Bucee’s Next Year!
Those Margaritaville employees are S-Tier. I’m amazed they helped make it happen
Hard Rock Cafe tour coming 2024?
I think you should try Applebees next, or burger king!
3:54 THATS NOT EVEN A JIMMY BUFFET SONG
Lol being from Syracuse: I am less than surprised that the margaritaville here sucks.
well i'm from Florida and the rain isn't that bad
Is that nakeyjakey?
literally one of the best youtube videos i have ever seen. live, laugh, JIMMY.
28:45 oh my god that’s MY rainforest cafe I’m literally going there next week
Now I wanna see eating at every bubba gumps
Very cool now do Arby's
now do every chipotle
Eddy solves depression with alcoholism for 24 days
Next roadtrip: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.???? :D
"For the last time" as if Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. don't exist...
I actually love this series so much and I love how so far you’ve done my two favorite restaurants it’s actually amazing
He's wasting away again.
Okay, but which one of those museum people was like "what if?.... Aliens were thicc?"
my brother got food poisoning at the pcb margaritaville so i’ve never been again 🎉 pier park is so much fun tho
>see thumbnail >nothing in the northwest >thankgod
Man this video has everything friendship, betrayal, happiness, disappointment, hitler, jimmy buffet, margaritaville, jimmy buffet’s margaritaville, homoerotic visuals that annoying fans will attach to write fanfiction, Toyota Tacoma rental, a giant blender and lots and lots of drama
52:50 Aw shit, that’s my favorite scene in Blade Runner 2049
Glad to see that Disney hasn't gotten rid of all of their terrifying nightmare hallucination rides... and instead have replaced them with others! Shout out to Mr Toad's Wild Ride which traumatized me and my cousin who had the misfortune of being forced to ride solo!
The fact that Canada had the best restaurant in both videos makes me so happy haha
Margaritas is a adult rainforest cafe
awh shit..here we go again
crying at jarvis getting ignored at the 5:27 cheers
Now you guys have to do Bubba Gump next
Eddie wearing the hat and outfit looks like this friend of my family who went round the world scuba diving apparently at every public ones and bring me back wierd items.  p.s I later found out he was first friends with my uncle but he was in love my mum and even asked her not to marry my dad 😅
Do every Mc Donald's next please.
I just want Jimmy to hear about this 😂
So I used to teach and one of my students family (I think it was mostly her dad) were really big Jimmy Buffet fans and every year they would do a trip to a different Margaritaville. Not just in the US- they’ve been all around the Caribbean and Mexico too
America is strange
https://youtube.com/@butta271?sub_confirmation=1
https://youtube.com/@butta271?sub_confirmation=1
https://youtube.com/@butta271?sub_confirmation=1
Now it’s every Bubba Gump to complete this trilogy.
https://youtube.com/@butta271?sub_confirmation=1
You can't make this shit up. 1 month before you went to every Rainforest Cafe, we had just gone to Galveston for vacation and went to their Rainforest Cafe... and now 1 month before you went to every Margaritaville we went to the one in San Antonio while we were driving through.       Stop following me Eddy. You can't have the kids back. Judge Jorner would not be happy if I told him how close you've gotten.
YOU USED TO BE MY BROTHER
hahah “tinnitus” 😂 classic
Every McDonald's, starbucks, wendies...?
Next Year: Every Bubba Gumps in the Country
as a kid the live action the cat in the hat did terrify me, in live action that show is terrifying no matter what
Omg why!? I love it, Ive honestly never heard of this, but it seems interesting
so....hard rock cafe is next right?
I haven't gotten on that Ferris wheel since it caught fire
Hell yeah, Poutine ftw
I feel like with each new merch drop, Eddy is slowly making the perfect clothing brand for masc lesbians.
Out of the whole Universal Studios park my grown ass loved the cat in the hat ride
Eddie once again creating his problems for our amusement is a length only the best YouTubers are willing to go to
Next up go to every McDonald’s 🤣
Do subway next.
Did you hear they just opened up two more Margaritavilles in the last 24 hours?
I'm so excited, I'm going to a Buc-ees today!!!  ❤❤
Gunna be honest, loved the video, but I did scroll past it several times because I didn't read the title and just assumed it was the rainforest cafe one popping up for some reason 😅
being someone from arizona, as a kid i always wanted to see the thing. it was a dream but my parents never let us see it so thank you for fulfilling my childhood dreams
Instructions unclear on getting feet pics. Guess I'll settle for a shirt.
So worth it! 🎉
Do planet Hollywood now
Ok so ya have to do Hard Rock Cafe next year. There's 34 in the USA
Jesus. I live near enough to THE THING??? tourist trap that I could've visited at any time. Had no idea they had such a high budget psuedo science museum. Now i'm actually glad I didn't give them money!
don’t forget about the margaritaville cruise!!!
You have an absolutely glorious moustache, teach me your ways
I had two pretty bad days so far and then I heard that song at 39:47 (when he went on the ferris wheel) and it cheered me up. Can anyone find this song?
There’s so many restaurants you all could do this with but, you guys should do Planet Hollywood next.
Every Hard Rock Cafe in the world when 😂
Eddie was in Syracuse and I missed him
Watch them do Planet Hollywood next year 😂.
This was so epic. The amount of editing to bring this all together must have been tremendous. Well fuckin done, sir.
Now do every Mcdonalds.
Just sticking to the end of this video was a challenge let alone actually doing this. I never want to hear the name Jimmy buffet again. Ten points to Eddy and ted for doing this, twice now. Eddy thankyou for doing this, you are a great YouTuber.
As a Louisiana native, I never order Creole/Cajun dishes whenever I travel outside of Louisiana. It's never good and sometimes plainly nothing close to the real thing.
You went to every rainforest Cafe and margaritaville in us and Canada. Big deal, a ton of people have done that. If you really want to stand out, you need to visit every Bubba Gump as well.
Why did you rent a gas guzzling truck to travel cross country?
I cant wait for the full length film of this experience to come out on netflix in 10 years.
Go to every Dave & Busters. Do it.
HES TRENDINGGGGGGG
Next video: I ate at every McDonalds in the country
pleasantly surprised NakeyJakey was there
Bucc-ees is what happens when space is cheap and profit margins high
Omg not the Minsy billboard 😂 you don’t understand the lore
I can’t believe you did this to yourself again.
BilAHxi? BILAHXI????? it's biLUXi
Wtf I had no clue this was an actual restaurant I thought it was just corny merchandising based off a song
I did not just spend 45 minutes watching this video for him to be done w cleveland in 1 minute
"the day you had self-reflection was the day you had diarrhea?" actually want a shirt with this printed on
Wake up babe Eddy and Ted did the Rainforest Cafe trip AGAIN
So, how many Bubba Gump Shrimp Company's are there?
damn man you should have shown off cleveland a bit more, come back for literally anything else than margaritaville. the flats have some fantastic eats.
gotta do Bubba Gumps next summer!
"The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" I mean yeah. Gives you time to think lol
46:32 Misny spotted
So are we doing Hard Rock Cafe next year or…?
whahaha the 'the thing' shirt on day 14
#1 on trending, great job @EddyBurback
>Final time Bullshit, I'm calling it now sometime in the next couple years Eddy and Ted are gonna hit up every Hard Rock Cafe
Now that your warmed up, i think itys time for the Chuck E Cheese challenge!
he knows what we want and we get it. we want his culinary pain
he knows what we want and we get it. we want his culinary pain
I can’t wait for season 3: Eddy takes on the Hard Rock Cafe.
props to day 13 staff
I love fake history lol
oh shit that is @JarvisJohnson, Always be plugging. that man is gold, this video is about to be amazing.
Awe❤ that kid probably saw you playing by yourself and joined in because they thought it was too sad to see a grown man play stinky feet alone 😢
that dancing guy in miami is right by my work building
The sequel I never expected but that we all needed.
Love to see the Tim Misney billboard in Cleveland
oh god why
So what restaurant are you all doing next 😂
Having stayed at a Margaritaville before I can honestly say that the accommodations were a lot nicer than the food.  I would stay again but probably never eat there again.
Constantly disappointed by the grilled chicken but keeps ordering it anyways 😂
You know what they say. “No Safari fries is a feast for the eyes”
What's next? Hard Rock Cafe?
you should visit every mcdonalds in america
Hard Rock next year, pls. 33 in the US and 2 in Canada.
I straight up thought this was a repost of the Rainforest Cafe one
Applebees next
Shoudl've finsihed off the trip with a Margaritaville cruise
Honestly so sad the one in Exton, PA closed like a decade ago because it was in a standalone building in the middle of a Kohl’s parking lot. It was open for less than a year. RIP
Didn’t go to the Jacksonville location, smh
I dontlike this one as much as Ted's. sorry :/
Without suffering there is no purpose . Well done.
Eddy I saw this title right after finding you from Rainforest Cafe. Stop forcing yourself to eat food. But also I love Jimmy Buffett so much I am excited for this. 🤣 (It's my own damn fault)
44:25 for Syracuse locals
This is my dream.
The Atlanta branch manager is a complete legend
I only have one thing to say about this video. Eddy, you say Biloxi so weird
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next!!
It seems like the only logical next step is every Hard Rock Cafe in North America
Eddy nobody made you do this twice. But im glad you did, this is what it means to be human
Sone Of these restaurants Could totally be call of duty maps
For the love of god just have some chamomile
Dose he only do these videos now? I fell like I have dejavu
Atlanta traffic sucks so bad that I'm only commenting to clarify that I HATE IT.
i do this but with chilies and instead of going to everyone in the country i go to the one next to my house
Next year y’all are going to go to all the Buba Gumps in the country. Lol
This Ted character seems sick in the head
nobody is making you so this, have some self control buddy
that ending tho
Why do you hate yourself 😂
how did i watch an hour of this...twice?
I was really hoping to see the Margaritaville cruise ship in this lmao💀
YESSS GO DIRTY MYRTYYYYYYYYYY❤❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤❤🎉
That gorilla at the Mall of America Rainforest Cafe almost looks like it's mocking you. Eddy, you and Ted are brave souls for doing this. Also, I'm from the Chicago suburbs, so the fact that the Navy Pier Margaritaville experience left you all feeling...not good...is disappointing, but I'm glad you all made it through okay!
@12:00 omg thats gorgeous wth. Wtf did i not know SA was so damn PRETTY
Cant wait for "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country" next year.
Next one: Medieval Times
ya but can u go to every mcdonald’s in the country??
Can’t wait for next year when Eddy goes to every Hard Rock Cafe
I didn’t think you’d do this twice, do what everyone least expects
why the hell is this number one on trending
Also doubles as the  world’s longest hangover
I put this on my tv....after what felt like 15 minutes I acidentelly hit the remote...it was at 56:12 that i saw the time of the video.
i was so blind but now i see that james william buffett is our corporate country singing god
46:32 yooooo Tim Misney
I was once stuck on a bus in traffic for over an hour with a ton of fans going to a Jimmy Buffet concert. Their fans are called Parrot Heads and I heard for a very long time all about their various Buffet anniversaries. So hopefully this kicks off a long relationship.
I know at the end Eddy said this is their last time doing this, but if this video does REALLY well maybe they have another one left in them. My brother said that all the Hard Rock Cafe's could be possible (although they would need to fly to Hawaii), and now I am kind of obsessed with the idea.
Next year: I went to every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in the country
Ya'll should go to the cheesecake factory next time and try all the different cheesecakes. There are currently 321 factories in America that make the cheesecake. But if you have the discipline to go to all the rainforest café and the Margaritaville you both should be able to do this.
I live in Panama City FL, and my wife worked there for a while. Its def a cult lol. /j
7:13 "and final time"  Ok can't wait to see next year's road trip
common atlanta w
the end of the trilogy needs to be buccee’s
sooooooo. is hard rock next year?
Did I just watch a hour long video of a random man going to every Margaritaville, a restaurant and song I've never heard of, and learnt it's story? Yes.   Why? I have no clue
No you guys aren't done until you hit Margaritaville at Sea
16:20 should be how traffic signals signal
Hard Rock Cafe
Just wait: next year, they’ll be doing Hard Rock Cafe.
Can’t wait for next year at every bubba gump shrimp in the US
Did y’all not learn your lesson the first time with smosh about carbon emissions?
I actually got punched by Jimmy buffet at the bean thank you for being back all the trauma.
I hope you keep making videos like this it’s absolutely delightful!! Maybe Cracker Barrel 😂
ole big tidy girl wouldnt be there without the cash
As a Syracuse, NY local, I sincerely apologize for our terrible Margaritaville. please forgive us Eddy and Ted
Oh meh. They're making a new one in my town. I don't like it lol I've never even heard of it before 😅 and it's not the Boston one..
35:05 Just so you know you got some MargaritaSpit®on those.
Eddy, blink twice if Jimmy is holding you hostage
Sooooo what’s next ?
8:50 Any argument for evidence of god is equally an argument that aliens did it, so this museum is basically the Margaritaville version of the Creation Museum
So I saw Planet Hollywood and Bubba Gump Shrimp in the background.   There’s also Hard Rock Cafe- and Ted could collect the merch specific to each one
The jimmy buffet cult is insane— my best friend in high school, his parents would leave him at home alone at random points for like a week just to go to margarita ville in Orlando (which was maybe a 6 hour plane ride away), and they had done this to him since he was 8
Ive already lost count of all the times eddy bitches about the very thing he decided to do.
Planet Hollywood next
Yikes
Now, do Applebee’s.
please eat at every mcdonalds
Next year, you and ted need to go to every cracker barrel in North america
can’t believe you didn’t see the hurricane in myrtle, that thing scared me so bad as a kid it took me 12 years to go back to a margaritaville
I'm from Florida and the rain is absolutely fucking atrocious. I drove 45 minutes to work one day at like 6am in ungodly heavy rain coming down at a 45° angle only to find out from a friend in New York after I got home that it was a tropical storm.  Sunshine State my ass

8:54 Warhammer 40K lore:
You should have taken the cruise!
babe wake up! Eddy Burback uploaded!!1
My wife fucking loves this place
"second and final road trip" UR NOT GONNA FINISH THE SAGA????
Why rent a pickup truck to drive across country???? Why not get something smaller with way better mileage and save a bunch of money (and pollution)?
How is a human being allowed to open 14 of these?
38 minutes in and I finally started to get what the heck is happening here. What kind of culture are we living in guys?
just please never do hooters
i think you might have a stalker in texas lol \
I've been a fan of Eddy's for awhile now, and I think it's time for me to say that whenever I look at Eddy's name I don't see Eddy Burback, I see Eid Mubarak. I won't be taking questions. I think it's beautiful.
That's not Schlatt! That's him with a silly filter, he's much more chisled normally
8:58 that "woah" had Mista GG vibes lol
I’m so entranced by these videos. But I am also thinking this is my worst IBS nightmare materialized
no you didn’t
If they were really about the fans, they would go to each McDonald’s in the USA and Canada.
Sooo... Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next?
why does every location in the United States look plasticky and fake 😭😭
Like the Rainforest Cafe, I have never heard of Margaritaville so thank you for sharing The United States of America’s rich & fulfilling culture with those outside of the States ❤
We desperately need a Margaritaville at Sea video next
Of course the Californian is scared of a gas station
"Final cross country trip for a restaurant." What about Bubba Gumps???
but you didnt come to the resort in port bolivar texas lol🤷‍♀
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp next!
Ted's face at 9:39 I'm dying!
if you do this for a THIRD time come to the Jacksonville Fl margaritaville, looks like a retirement home 😀🤣
Next year you need to go to every Bubba Gump!
Holy shit, the comedic timing on the build-up and editing around that Ferris Wheel picture was so perfect
It’s so hard to watch someone live your dream 😣
Eddy, I just started the video, I really hope you came to the margaritaville in sc (it’s a neighborhood not a restaurant) I’m very excited to see how you handle this
You should visit every bucc-ees next
THANK U FOR UR SERVICES EDDY
As a Canadian. I can confirm we have the best margaritaville
Eddy I hope you know you have just declared war on the McElroy family
How much for the toes?
No one tell Eddie there's only 22 Bubba Gump locations in the US.
No way this is the final trip!
*One year from now*   "As I eat another hamburger at the 27th Hard Rock Cafe restaurant on this trip I summon the strength received from seeing the left sock Steven Tyler wore in Aerosmith's music video "Hole in my Soul" in a display case and tell myself...this is what rock music would want me to do.
I love the Biloxi Margaritaville!! I’ve been there so many times and watched it being built
"you had *intestinal problems* yesterday what are you talking about!?"  yep I made my mind up this is the best quote from the video
“Oh shit coolest motherfuckers on the planet” 47:16
The boys are back in town(s).
“I went to this guy Spencer for directions… word of advice, do NOT go in there” HAHAHAHAH
Bro, do Applebees.
crazy reupload
dude i was just thinking about how much you spent just on hotels 😭 i just went on vacation last month and it was hell trying to find anything affordable for just my mom and i. and you guys stayed in fancy hotels
Bradyn is Eddy’s Canon event
Next up: every McDonald's in the country.
You madman, you did it again ! 😂
#1 on trending?! Well bloody done.  🤜🤛
i liked the skunk u saw
Seeing those Florida skies makes me miss home.  Love that state.  Hope you got a Cuban sandwich while going through Tampa or Miami btw, oh and Key lime pie made with actual Key limes is the best!
Missed the Margaritaville resort at Lake of the Ozarks. Better do it again!
#1 on trending Burback
Not again you maniac
as a European I just want to say that this video screams AMERICA
🎉 well done you two, I always knew you had it in you 🏖️👏
Now so bubba gump lmaooo
ok bubba gump is next year right we all agree on this
eddy you went to my city and didn’t say hi wtf
Hard Rock Cafe next
Do McDonald’s.
Jimmy Buffet always gave me the feeling of a guy who sells timeshares to old and middle aged people.
i cannot remember the last time I was so excited to see something pop up in my recommended   so ready to go on this ride, godsend
Do casa Bonita next year
BUT WHAT ABOUT EATING AT EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE IN THE US AND CANADA?!
Why didn't you just get something different at each one?  The menu looked to have a lot of different items 🤷🏻‍♂️
I would watch a whole Netflix show of Eddy going on unnecessary road trips.
Why though? 😅
I can’t believe they met Danny Gonzalez twice
Now visit every Walmart in the country
Talk about wasting away in Margheritaville
I found you through "schlatt" and "ted" videos, and I must say... I am hooked! I am here to stay. This side of the adventure is awesome! 🎉😊
Not as impressive
Bubba gumps next?
Ah, insane traffic and restaurants closing way too early. Welcome to Atlanta
It only took this video, to realise what the fuck am I doing with my life. This was an absolute waste of time, and from here on out I will never return to this website
Rip Jimmy Buffet just in time for Eddy’s video.
Great now do every single Cracker Barrel! True horror
Oh yeah! Hell yeah! It's a classic dinosaur laser fight!
The Rainforest Cafe video was Hereditary, this shit is Midsomer
Eat at every McDonald's next
Death road to canada moment
I was so convinced when you were in Chicago you said “THE BEACH” and was so confused so the bean was a pleasant surprise
before this video i could never tell the difference between jimmy buffet and tommy bahama. now, i know the beauty of jimmy buffet. thanks eddy
Every Denny’s next pls
Sounds like I won’t be eating at these chain restaurants anytime soon and I live less than 3 hours from Piegan Forge.
If Eddy and Ted don't do Hard Rock cafe next year we riot.
There’s one in fort lardadale airport that I eat at once and saw a fat dude in a Batman t shirt I’m disappointed that he didn’t eat at that one
SOMEBODY CALL DEFUNCTLAND ABOUT THAT CAT IN THE HAT RIDE
I cant wait in 10 years when eddy goes to every Mcdonalds in the country
“When the Key Lime Pie hit my mouth all I tasted was keys”
This is so good they should screen it in the restaurants/hotels 24/7.
R.I.P Jimmy Buffett, may you go to a Margaritaville in heaven
yall think they gonna do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next?
Can't wait for eddy and ted to go to every McDonalds across earth!
Dang you were so close to my hood multiple times and I missed you guys. Hope Florida treated you alright!
Would have been sick to join yall in  tulsa im not too far away
the kerning of "union st" from the capital u to the n is terrible at 36:14 i know you cant fix it but damn that bad
That self reflection in the bean was deep
God I love that this exists... The sequel we never knew we needed!!!
i was so excited for the atlantic city one but it’s probably good it was uneventful
I just imagine your credit card company reviewing your statements for spam, seeing all the Margaritaville charges and thinking "NOT AGAIN!!"
Thank you for distracting Ted, the mastermind behind 9/11, for a little while longer so he doesn’t have time to plot his next act of terror
Theres just something about two men slowly lose thier minds over shitty chain restaurants 😭😭
ted'a the thing shirt
Imagine if Eddy did a I ate at every McDonald’s in the world. His career would be over 😂.
Loved hearing about your trips to Wi Dells as a kid, as a Dells local its crazy going other places in the country that feel like almost carbon copies
I feel like a Supreme Court judge analysing each side's testimony
I'm imagining Midsommar except it's Eddy and everyone's wearing Hawaiian shirts.
I think we all know the logical conclusion to this trilogy: Bubba Gump’s Shrimp restaurant
Wow 24 day PB on the Margaritaville speed run! Most first runs are in the high 30’s.
Eddy's really got that Kubrick stare down
After watching the whole video I realized  This was not like rainforest Cafe this was a journey  A journey of life and discovery.  Eddy if you see this Even if it's the last time you do somthing like this I don't care I'm glad this would be a final send off
if you make two, you have to make a trilogy im afraid
In my country we have a island that is called Margarita, thanks Jimmy for the effort.
My vote for next year's terrible road trip idea: Every Hard Rock Cafe
As a non-north american I found this fascinating
watching this from the UK is weird because he's not a thing here. I only know his name from references on TV shows
The only reason they picked a truck, instead of a car (which would allow them to sleep in the back, is clearly so they can have homosexual oral sex during the drive. There is no logical reason to drive a Tacoma cross country when a civic gets better gas mileage and offers better ergonomics.
I laughed so hard when Eddy recorded that billboard in Cleveland. That’s a NE Ohio legend. TIM MISNY
I'm a little upset that they closed the location just outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. We had one there for years, but it's also been closed for a good 10-20 years now. I wanted to go just for the fun of it.
The moment at the Spencer's made me laugh out loud XD also- hell yeah Canada! Another win for us Canuks
big yikes
Next up is eating at every McDonald’s in the country
Insert Owen Willson "WoOoW" at 31:36  I tootally darn dang didn't do an impersonation of the famous actor Owen Willson's "Wow" :3
men will go to every rainforest cafe and margaritaville in the US and Canada instead of going to therapy
seeing the pigeon forge margaritaville brought back traumatizing memories of me being there and puking at my table
Masterpiece
As a native Augustan, I know exactly where you got stuck on I-20...lol 😅  That highway is notorious from basically at the GA Border through to Atlanta...
When is the "ate at every McDonalds" video
Quick pro tip: always drink a glass of water with each of your sugary cocktails, kids!
I love these videos. I would love to see how you guys planned these trips.
The sequel we didn’t deserve
Glad to hear you had the authentic Atlanta traffic experience
go to bubba gump next year
Now do all the McDonald’s in the country
Medieval Times has 10 locations and requires a 3hr show alongside your meal. That would be funny.
Oh my God, glad my backyard (Syracuse) was the most disappointing
why does every margaritaville pin on the map look like Samus
Hard Rock Cafe next?
soon Eddy will make an nationwide chain restaurant and then eat at all of them
The more of these videos I watch, the more I am convinced that America is just a parody of itself.
OK next eat at every Waffle House.
Haha! Buddy is my dog. I had no Idea who you were until I saw this video in my recommended.
that drew gooden is such a sweetheart
I hope this becomes a yearly thing to visit all of a certain restaurant
the margaritaville in atlanta is the absolute best, they took pictures of us when we dressed up in jimmy fashion for our dinner to put on their wall. i love them
This better not be the final time please sir this is the highlight of my year
Thank you for not filming the kid at the hotel. 👍
As a Texan, fuck Buccees
So yall wanna go to every Bubba Gump in the country next year?
Did you not go to Jax Beach one?
You should do Hard Rock Cafe next
Im 21 and literally every single time i go into buccees i lose my family
“Shut up and tell Mickey Mouse” sounds like something Anasui would say
Next year: I ate at every Medieval Times in the country
"the day you had self-reflection was the day you had diarrhea?"
for a moment my brain couldn't come up with the name "ted" so i had to refer to him as "the antagonist from the eddy burback restaurant videos", and you know what? I stand by it. Even the ghost kitchen video. Ted did that, he did the ghost kitchens. He told mr beast to do burger. i think Buddy the Dog was an angel from god sent to reward you for not smashing Ted with a rock Cain and Abel style.
next video: I ate at every McDonalds in the world
so obviously we need you to do Hard Rock Cafe next
I met you guys that day in Chicago so seeing the footage from that day in your video is super trippy. Thanks for being extremely nice.
Idk why I wanna see this i definitely wouldn't exactly support a chain like this especially when it ruins vacations in other countries on the cruises I've been on 😂 but this is about to be legendary
Nah its not the final one they will go to every Planet Hollywood
Great video
Eddy, I mean this without any irony, but these two videos are works of art.  The people thank you, even if your colon, liver, and intestines don't.
That madman did it again!
Your body should be studied after what its been through.
Jimmy wouldn’t have a tummy ache because he’s killed off his gut biome with 50+ years of tequila and cheeseburgers
Funnily enough there’s one in the airport terminal at DTW and I got a gate next to it today. Maybe it’s a sign
He really wasted away again at Margaritaville
Thank you for giving Ohio the screen time we deserve.
Congrats on #1 Trending! You and Ted deserve it for the hell you've put yourselves through lol
bill-uhx-i. o acts like a u. As a GoM res i disagree with it on principle but it has been drilled into my head so hard i had to tell you
Loving the Jimmy Buffet mutual infidelity lore lol

Look everyone its todd nevision
I was wondering if you were going to stop at “The Original Margaritaville” in Sandusky OH (west of Cleveland). They have signs for it all over the interstate. Apparently it pre-dates Jimmy’s trademarking for his chain. I did not know this until watching this video and looking it up, lol
The ultimate video would be every Hard Rock Cafe in the world. Bubba Gumps is also an option.
do Chuck E. Cheese next
Can't wait for 2024's inevitable conclusion to what will be a legendary trilogy
Respect the Buccees
Very nice video
Edward why???
Eddy doing a quick humble brag about going for a run.
I have an extreme hatred of Jimmy Buffet music so I won’t be caught dead in a Margaritaville, but Eddy went to all of them so I don’t have to go to a single one! Thanks, Eddy!
I finally understand what YT comedians are making fun, this guys awful channel that YT promotes endlessly.
The sins of the past (Rainforest Cafe breakdown) inform the actions of the present (Margaritaville/Jimmy Buffett cultist)
I started watching this this morning while making coffee. Now I'm late for work. Thanks.
Jimmy Buffet is a cult leader, confirmed
Should…….. should someone make an intervention for him-
YOU SKIPPED MARGARITAVILLE @ LAKE LANIER ISLAND IN GEORGIA!
BUBBA GUMP NEXT!
this is what i’ve been waiting for. i love jimmy buffett so much. my friends and i dedicated an entire weekend to jimmy<3 we dressed up, got daydrunk, and took MARTA to the atlanta margaritaville and had the absolute best time. i got a blender and a koozie that said “i <3 jimmy” and it was the best day of my life.
America is so fucking weird, I dont think something like this could ever happen anywhere else
unwindulax
For year 3 we need an Eddie and Ted Hard Rock Cafe road trip.
Very cool Eddy, now next year you gotta do all the Hard Rock Cafes. Thank you
NOOOOOO my beloved Luigi hatted man!!!!
now do taco bell....should keep you busy for a while
"On our way to Atlanta, traffic completely stopped"  Yeah
I love these videos. You make an adventure out of an otherwise mundane task of visiting a chain restaurant
Jimmy buffet is for alcoholic step dads and sorority girls
You have no idea how hard 3:05 hit me in the gut.
ISLANDS OF ADVENTURE, YES. CAT IN THE HAT, NO.
My family often goes to Pigeon Forge to go to Dollywood and we often longingly gaze at the Margaritaville. You’re so lucky to be able to go there.
Holy fuck. That Cat in the Hat ride was like the boat ride in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.   I can’t imagine being on that stoned/drunk.
The triceratops at 8:50 has metabolic bone disease 😅
On the off chance that either of you see this comment, I humbly request that next year  you do all 33 US Hard Rock Cafés and the 2 Canadian Hard Rock Cafés.   I would have said do all of the Chuck E Cheese's, but on looking it up and seeing that there's 468 locations (and presumably you like seeing your families and friends) maybe give that one a pass.
Yes yes.. eat food for our pleasure Mr YouTube man! 😂
YES EDDY YYEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!
I love how these videos all have a gradual descent into madness, and while I dont want you to suffer through this again I also really want this to be like a yearly thing lol
MISNY MAKES THEM PAY
Don't kill Ted. Somebody already tried to kill a kid at the rainforest cafe here in Minnesota
The sequel to the world's greatest roadtrip movie😂
"final time" yeah buddy, mhm. definetly
As a Canadian hearing Eddy say he got the poutine and it was the best thing he had is the strongest sense of national pride I have ever felt
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company or the Hard Rock Cafe next???
You know you're too Tim Robinson pilled when u hear "MOJO BONES" and start laughing like an absolute maniac.
Every Hard Rock Cafe next?
Should've eaten more veggies my man.
I feel like you really missed out on using the SpongeBob meme for the days
Medieval times?
I see you went to tropical Isle, did you try the Shark Attack there? I love that drink lol
as a non-american, this is exactly what i picture america to be like
Now you should go to every mcdonalds in america
Loving finding out about these weird places. This was the guy in Jurassic World right?
#1 on trending, congrat! Good video!
Tune in next year for every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in North America.
The Thing!!!!! You went to The Thing!!!!!!   And just a correction and fun fact, it was actually two races of aliens warring against eachother. The “evil” aliens weaponized dinosaurs to fight against the “good” aliens. Lol….  (I live like 45 mins south of there near the boarder. I have to drive on I-10 past it for work sometimes, and I went there like 3 weeks ago cause I was bored lol) Cochise County!!!!
Please, please, don't let this be the last video of this style. These are too damn fun to watch.
So when they do two in a day are they drink driving?
im calling that next year is hard rock cafe
I hope this becomes an annual tradition, a national holiday in a sense
TBH I started following this and Ted Nivison Channel because of the last trip and I'm so glad this happened please make this a yearly tradition as long as it is fun/ profitable for you guys.
I see your foreshadowing. "We'll never do this again" (while standing in front of the Las Vegas Planet Hollywood)
31:58
Do Cracker Barrell next year
can't wait for the next one." I ate at every Mcdonalds in the country"
The green screen Ferris Wheel picture sums up this whole video
I'm so glad I didn't hallucinate The Thing? on my road trip. thanks eddy
Just to let you guys know: the Hard Rock Cafe ALSO exists 😎😎😎😎
One Margaritaville is bad enough I cant believe there's that many
Eddy keeps saying "final" but we all know they'll do it again next year
What about the one in Bossier City?
You just gonna tell me they skipped the margaritaville in the Detroit airport
this series is very american (in a good way) - sincerely a european
These crazy bastards have done it again! Truly inspirational
Every McDonalds in th country
‘Buckeye’s RUBS, Buckeye’s NUTS’😂
Thanks for the video, see you in 2024 for the 22 locations of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. 🦐
You should do every McDonald’s in the countey
I'm glad you did, that's what it means to be human
I’m so sorry to break to this to you guys but there is more Margaritavilles in the US! There’s a couple airport versions 😅
That mnm kiss was comedy gold
mike sausage made you😡😡😡😡😡😡🥵
Do McDonalds next.
There are only 20 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s in all of North America with one in Canada and two in Mexico and the one in Mall of America is across from the Margaritaville and the Rainforest Cafe. I see no other option for episode 3 of this insanity.
I’ve never been to margaritaville but I have been to the now closed cheeseburger in paradise restaurant.
I love the one in Missouri , only 5 days though cause drinking hurts
Crazy how I got this video as soon as I go to San Antonio and saw the Margaritaville restaurant at the Riverwalk. I'm currently still here. I just wanted to put my thoughts during this since I'm still here and I know no one asked, so I'll shut up now
I know this is the "Final" one but it wouldn't be surprising if this happens again next year.
Omg whaaaat they had a rise of the beasts statue in Times Square? That’s so cool.
You and Ted should do all Burger Kings in the USA next year tbh
Growing up in Florida and with Jimmy Buffet being a constant in my childhood means that the first section of this video made me laugh and feel weirdly nostalgic (one of the Margaritavilles you went to was in my hometown!!!). When I was a little kid, the food quality at these restaurants used to actually be pretty good and my whole family would scarf down Cheeseburgers in Paradise like our lives depended on it. But then Jimmy Buffet sold the brand to some other company and the quality went down which is unfortunate. If you're ever back in Florida you should try the Lulu's restaurants which are named and owned by Jimmy Buffet's sister. Although it is still beachy tourist food, the quality is much better (presumedly because it wasn't bought out). I especially recommend their nachos, smoothies, fried chicken, and any salad with their homemade dressing. Plus there's only a few of them so you won't have to torture yourself to get there.  Also fun fact: Jimmy's plane in Citywalk Orlando was actually shot down by the Jamaican government because they thought he was smuggling drugs and instead of getting mad, Jimmy wrote a song about it and you can still see the bullet holes on the plane if you know where to look
do mcdonalds next
#1 on trending........ Good job Eddy.
Was rewatching the rainforest cafe video for the 5th time yesterday just in awe at the rewatchibility of your suffering and now we get more YAY
I think we’ll be logical solution now is…… Hard Rock Cafe tour. 😂
As a European, American culture is just so weird and random.
10 years from now, he will be putting out a video "I ate at every McDonalds in the USA, Canada, Mexico and a small island in Indonesia".
so next year all the bubba gump shrimp restaurants?
I got a pop up that said this content may be upsetting BRO WHAT DID YOU ORDER????
you should do Hard Rock Cafe next
So is Bubba Gump Shrimp gonna be the next one
Some heroes don't wear cape, they ate at Magaritaville
Waiting For “I went to every Bucc-Ees in the USA”
And at the end it caps off with existential crisis. 10/10 video.
Good Job 👍 nuf said
Eddy how is this profitable
Okay now go to every burger king
This was worth it just for the 52:50 flirty green M&M bit
Ah I’m so pissed. I could’ve seen you at pier park. I was probably there at the time too
I think it is time to level up to the next level. Try all McDonald's in the world.
Can’t wait for the 2 month journey next year where you two visit all margaritavilles and rainforest cafes
When Eddy uploads, I watch. No debate.
Ted wearing the The Thing shirt halfway into the video sent me
"Final" roadtrip
So wich chain comes next 'Bubba Gump' or 'Hard Rock Cafe'?
Every planet Hollywood next
Now go to every McDonald's in the US and Canada
Isn't there one in Hawaii?
There’s a margaritaville in the US Virgin Islands. You don’t need a passport to fly there = it’s in the country. You didn’t go to them all and you are a fraud.
Honestly I’m PRO climate change now…. If the water level rising stops these hotels it may be worth it
They forgot the Lanier one
52:45 Bladerunner 2049
just to be clear, you WERE pulling off the hat
If I had a nickel....
As an autistic person who eats the same thing pretty much every day and who will eat at the same place for 10 years I can’t help but chuckle. It’s sort of wild to me the difference between folk who don’t do this usually and myself and a lot of my friends who are also autistic. I have been eating french toast at least 5 times a week for 20 years now.
Cant wait for someone to sponsor the "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the world" video. Come on Eddy, you know you want to
So Jakey lied.... he does not, in fact, stay nakey.....
Of course you got traffic going into Atlanta. Welcome to the ATL
These videos really have 1.3m views after not even 5 hours, that's insane.
Why does american food always look so incredibly bad 😂
Do one with all the hard rock cafes next year !? 🥹🥹🥹
Eddy you’re a freak :/
no way why are you and schlatt friends? hes racist :(
5:34 you and Jordan look flipping adorable. I said to my nephew the other day "I want more Jordan and Eddy content" this shared smile satisfied that want..... for now! So you boys better start a podcast or something lmao
Dude. 17 hours ago posted at over a million views. Number 1 on trending. Its not what you do its how you do it. Siiiiccc
Wait a minute - what about Nashville??
second and final trip ??? 😔🥺😩
Honest thought it was a reupload until he mentioned rainforest cafe.
why'd you do this to yourself?
I also have self reflection when I have diarrhoea
Saw the thumbnail and thought it was the Rainforest Cafe video 😂
They forgot the Shreveport one or did I miss them saying that one?
Please restock the margarita shirt in size s🙏 I really want one😅
mate... you are good. a little too good....great video
Came here to throw down my vote for a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co spinoff!
These two videos are my barbenheimer
Next Episode: "I ate at every McDonalds in the Country"
yo ted nevson copi '
Eddy how did you get the rights to use Vivaldi's Four Seasons by Jimmy Buffett?
I see Hard Rock Cafe in the future
These two vids were amazing as a non-american, not only do I have no idea who Jimmy Buffet is, i also have no idea what eating at these kind of heavily themed chain restaurants feels like, so this is just a fever dream to me. Or it might just shape my idea of the US. Who knows. Nothing seems real over there anyway.
There's a restaurant called Cheeseburger in Paradise in Honolulu. I had Thanksgiving dinner there one year
Aye, yo and people be thinking only japan got some weird and interesting shit.
I went on the cat in the hat ride back in March, and the ride broke down. My friends and I sat there for 10 minutes just waiting
The arcs that this man when through 😂
19:33 i call bullshit, i watched those ads for a reason
missed pensacola
y'all missed the one in Miami airport 😂
You say final, but it's time to face the final boss battle of the Hard Rock challenge
22:10 i want to know this man's story
See I knew what Rainforest Cafe was, but not this place. But considering how the last video went, I can’t wait till your sanity fades again.
As if Rainforest Cafe wasn't bad enough, the both of them thought "LET'S RUN IT BACK"
How much for your toes?
18:19 widebody hellcat
what about Next Year? maybe Bubba Gump…
I used to work at the Margaritaville in Georgia!!!!
“second and final time” yeah………… sure
He’s started a religion
What if next year y’all went to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaurant, themed after the movie forest gump, in the US
Genuinely shocked none of the hotel locations had a breakfast "Jimmy Buffet"
He was totally pulling off the hat.
We need a trilogy…  I would pay money to see Eddy and Ted hit up every location in the US of literally one of the worst chains. Like Applebees or Cracker Barrel. Or have the final boss be Cheesecake Factory.
Atlanta employees, big W
Oh my god boy please be kinder to yourself. Stop
Huh. Apparently, I have (had) no idea who Jimmy Buffett was. I thought he was some business dude. I dunno, I never put much thought into it.
I can't help but see Samus Arans Head on the map
Hard Rock Cafe is next. Have fun taking the Tacoma to Hawaii
So that’s what you’ve been up to
I can’t wait for part three!
The sequel we didn't know we wanted, bless you!
I see your "eating at all of the rainforest cafes & margaritavilles in the united states and canada" and I raise you eating at every hard rock cafe in the united states and canada
you do be looking quite spiffy
I'm British and have almost 0 idea who Jimmy Buffet is but this was one of the funniest videos I've watched in a while
52:48 "You look lonely, I can fix that"
I love the coolest mother fuckers on the planet guy . Was he taking the piss was he being genuine no one knows but god damn he was right
She Jimmy on my Buffet till I Margaritaville
yikes! eddy did it yet again
so what ur saying is Hard Rock Cafe tour 2024
see you next year for i ate at every mall food court!
You didn't go to Margaritaville in Capitola, CA!
I never thought Eddy could top the Rainforest Cafe video, but the storytelling in this is impeccable.
No Gatlinburg?! Two Margaritavilles so close together!
About damn time
This was amazing! Next you should either go to every Medieval Times or to the weirdest themed restaurant in every (continental) state. That would be insane
Bubba Gump 2024
do apple bees next
Deja vu
What about every Medieval Times?
As someone who has a tummy, when eddy said his tummy hurt i really felt that.
Itd be cool if you tracked what you spent through every restaurant and presented it at the end of the video
WHAT HE DOIN?!
Isn't it kind of weird that Jimmy Buffet was friends with Jeffrey Epstein?
As an ibs survivor, thank you for doing the dream I never could, peace, love, and Jimmy buffet
Next trip should be the Bubba Gump's shrimp restaurants
How about eating at every McDonald's in the Country?
Man ted was getting getting stockholm syndrome from margaritaville toward the end.
This series??? I guess it’s a series now lol This series is so fun man I’m glad you had a good time this time  Looked fun like some real funnee bizness w jimmy
it's wild to me that the jimmy buffett themed restaurant isn't a buffet style restaurant
Final road trip?? So no every McDonald’s in America?
I think next years trip should be every single Bubba gumps in america
I don't know why, but I'm always watching your videos like mesmerized, especially about traveling. They are overflowing with irony and good humor. Eddy, thank you for that! Hello from far away Russia! 😄😄😄
i clicked on the video thinking i wonder if ted is in this honestly
Next years video: I ate at every McDonald's in the Country
Thanks Eddy, very cool!
#1 trending btw
The Hard Rock Cafe 🦧
Is planet Hollywood next?
Chucky Cheese is next
the misny billboard shot is so cleveland core
i love the merch pics
Hard Rock Cafe next please ok
I work at the one in Georgia and i about died when i saw this video pop up on my feed
This time next year you should visit all 34 hard rock cafes in the country 😂🤣😅
This series depresses me to no end. Please stop doing them. I mean.. I’ve watched both. In full.. and will continue to do so but seriously: please stop.
Just watched the Jury duty episode feauturing this resturaunt that I have never heard of. Now this, Sheesh gotta go.
You stopped at my home Buccees location! It's halfway in my commute between College Station and Houston.
Congrats on #1 trending my dude! You definitely deserve it with the amount of work you put into this!
The greatest ending to the trilogy, a trip which requires going overseas to eat at every variant of a restaurant. You might actually enjoy the food more. That's what I ask for the Worldwide Eddy Burback road trip, it is the ultimate.
Pro tip: If you're making a chain restaurant make sure that all your menu items taste good and that you don't have more locations than items on the menu otherwise when going on a chain restaurant road trip your customers will be very sad.
This is probably the best Jimmy Burback video ever!
I think at one point Walmart started selling margaritaville bikes complete with a squeaky parrot horn
Why is it everytime I see fish and chips done in the US it's trash? It's really not a hard dish to get right
one time was stuck in waiting for food in the syracuse one for 3 hours and we were probably the only people there <3
what is the music used at the end?
I can’t wait for next year’s I ate at every bubba gump shrimp location
17:31 this is my first time ever seeing a Penske truck that isnt about to crash into a bridge
Why.
Alcohol + grease = great trip for your liver
Great video! Now, do McDonald's.
My interest is piqued.
Beach Burger in Burger Beach
These have been one of my favorite YouTube series of all time. Thank you for your service, dedication, and sacrifice.  On that note- PLEASE DO HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT YEAR!!!
I hope Eddy let Ted's family go after this. Poor guy
This is awesome.
I love that your video is so different from teds yet so similar
that Atlanta Margaritavilla didn't do anything special LMAO. they tried to close early but customers called them on their official hours of operation. the manager probably could have gotten in trouble for not serving yall
You know one of these days we're all just gonna snap and ask you to eat at every Chuck E Cheese in the country
Missed the one in Mohegan sun casino in CT
#1 trending  You are godsent
Aaaaaaaand it's gone
I WAS TRAUMATIZED BY THE CAT IN THE HAT RIDE AS A CHILD. THANK YOU FOR THE VALIDATION. HOLY SHIT LOL
Hard Rock cafe when?
#1 on trending too… well worth it id say
The madman has done it again
Hard Rock Cafe next ?
You have to do Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament next! Shout out to the Maryland Castle servers! I miss you guys!
The MGV in Tulsa, they don’t own the casino. It’s owned by the Muskogee Creek Nation.  And those characters aren’t MGV but just some ol Slot Machine characters.
Now do McDonalds
Fun Fact: There are at least 10 Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurants around the US and one in Mexico. Just sayin…
52:48 you look lonely i can fix that
Hearing you and Ted both say Biloxi wrong gave me chills.  Thank you for the video.  (Also, there technically is a Margaritaville in Northern Alabama, however it's currently in development limbo as it has been for a few years now. You may need to make an addendum to the video... or make a follow-up visiting Lucy Buffet's resteraunts called Lulu's 👀)
So Eddy is gonna suffer for a month every year for our entertainment, right?
I'm excited for next year's video where you visit every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada
ted with the thing? shirt
I thought Margaritaville wasn't real
So uhh...bubba gumps?
You only do 5 videos a year?! That’s wild
Burback - rba = buck
Suffering willingly is the only trait unique to humans. I'm glad it was you and no one else that decided to prove that ;)
Is bubba gump next?
I think I speak for everyone when I say... when's the Eating at Every Mcdonalds (on the planet) video coming?
my cousin just k!lled herself and this is distracting me so thank you
I'm glad that you guys saw that guy twice.
13:50 WHAT IF Brayden (the guy at Bucees) is an alien who came to Earth to study people's habits and takes pics with his favorite -lab rat- celebrities throughout the years all while never aging!! 🤫👽😎
Already looking forward to the 2024 Hard Rock Café-roadtrip
I am bringing my children to the Thing Museum and convincing them it’s real
I got the fish and chips at the one in Chicago once. I was in the bathroom for about an hour. Trust me, that was not just an issue of too much margaritaville.
I want to like this guy, but he’s pretty boring
GET A FU*KING SALAD & if u know the chicken is dry don't get it. Crazy how eating fried food & sugary drinks will make u feel bad, who knew
I swear The Thing has the best roadside advertising in the US. I'm from Arizona and it makes everyone curious enough to stop and then be immediately disappointed.
cant wait for the every mcdonalds in america video
Can't wait for your year-long quest to visit all 172 Hard Rock Cafes on the planet.  😎
My favorite Jimmy Buffet song is the one where he sings about pina coladas and getting caught in the rain. Fins up! 🐬
I hope eddy knows he doesn’t need to  eat at chain restaurants to see his girlfriend and friends. Otherwise this might just escalate to every McDonalds in the USA
Eddy, its gotta be a trilogy. Do Hard Rock or something
48:23 Weezer (The Bean Album)
Next stop the world of Hard Rock Cafe
Why do you keep doing this to yourself?
You cannot convince youve gotten this far without hearing of deep eddys
THE CAT AND THE HAT  LIVE ACTION IS A HORROR FILM!
Now do every McDonald’s
I love all the clips of the random children that unintentionally pop up in this video
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
I couldnt be more proud to know that the PNW does not have margaritavilles lmfao
Glad to have you in syracuse 🤣
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT
America’s fucking weird man
https://youtube.com/shorts/Y2Zx5fWNX00?feature=share
HE ATE AT EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE IN THE WORLD
Yeah the Cat in the Hat ride traumatized my son. To this day he won't go on dark rides.
i recently saw someone compare jimmy buffet to taylor swift and it 100% checks out
I like the contrast between the first trip being Eddy being miserable while Ted was super hyped and this one being Ted being miserable while Eddy's the hyped up one
Wait did they go to the Capitola , CA Margaritaville?
Can't wait for the last film in the trilogy
where do we buy the feet pics?
43:04
"The highway was completely stopped." Yeah, that sounds like Atlanta.
The map pins look like Samus Aran, lol.
Justin McElroy has a new challenger
The fact that this video was a massive success means that round 3 is inevitably happening. What chain restaurant will Eddy hit next? Find out next year 👀
did you really need a pickup truck
Love your road trips! I don’t mean to be a buzz kill but what about the one in San Diego?
what are yall betting next years is?
I made out with a fat girl in the pool of that Marg-vill in Biloxi
do mcdonalds next
THATS THE WIGGLES RIDE I KNOW THE CAR ITS THE WIGGLES RIDE I KNOW IT I KNOW IT
By this point, I would not be surprised if they went to all 23 bubba Gump shrimps in the US
Why did you guys get an expensive, polluting, dangerous truck that requires extra equipment just to have a functioning boot (trunk), instead of a much more practical and cheap, smaller car?
Mississippian checking in here! Never heard Biloxi pronounced that way...have we been saying it wrong all this time?    No, it must be Eddy.
Nice video
Wait what about the one in Capitola?
How about every hard rock hotel in the country?
Do Applebee's next.  (I'm just kidding, please don't. I'm not ready to see a man die.)
The last one was Teds idea and it went really bad, now this one is Eddys idea and I’m 😂 to see how much better it actually is
Silent Hill hoodie <3 <3 <3
A man all out of ideas...  I remember when this guy used to make interesting videos...
I'm so glad that Jimmy Buffet and Margaritaville is one piece of American culture that hasn't spread to Europe. Before this I had never even heard of the guy.
Every Margaritaville?? mans wasted away
What happened to This Channel?
Over 9000
I'm in bed and my partner's at his desk. My headphones slipped out and he says "wait are you watching margaritaville?" and it turns out he'd been watching it too for like 37 minutes and I'd been watching for 40 mins. Now I keep going "spoiler, he sees a skunk" and he keeps going NOOO stop it stop it
bubba gump shrimp co next XD?
hard rock cafe next
The dedication and bravery to persist even through all the tummy aches is truly inspiring, absolute hero.
Next go to every subway in the us.
Wow, im impressed and fearful
started this video so worried about your tummy. we'll see how it goes...?
I ate at every McDonald’s?
Just when sou think you have america figured out, you find out about margaritaville
Why in the hell.. do you guys consider this entertainment? "Watch me spend money and do random shit". This is just the videography of some privilaged dude doing privilaged dude things.
did the south padre island texas location open before or after yall went on this journey.
Hearing someone who hasn’t really been there pronounce Biloxi is hilarious 😭
Ive literaly never heard of margaritaville before in my life lmao
For the 2nd and “last time” they hit the road again, who wants to bet they do the same thing again next year?
This is the Oppenheimer to Ted's video's Barbie
Not sure if this is the feeling other people get, but this video and the rainforest cafe video make me want do a roadtrip around the US. I'd love to take a couple months to see the country, although I'd probably base it around something other than going to every location of a mediocre theme restaurant chain. Here's to hoping Eddy does 40 days to visit every hard rock cafe in the US next year.
Amezing video 🤗🤗🤗👍
0:11 when the glow of the blood stained moon shines upon the land...
Wierd how in the original song Margaritville is a personification of his depression akd alcohol addiction, the line litterly goes "wasting away again in margaritaville"
45:08 wild
Eddie loving Poutine warmed my Canadian heart
Hard rock Cafe next year
I went to the Panama City beach margaritaville back in march during spring break…it was a rainy night and our server got fired mid shift because he somehow gave alcohol to an 8-10 year old little girl. I remember shortly after getting our drinks some older women was yelling at him and I overheard her say you gave my child alcohol and I saw the little girl standing behind her clutching her little teddy bear or doll she had with her looking a little tipsy. After they left I saw our server holding his head at the bar behind us looking very distraught while a bunch of coworkers consoled him. So it was quite the experience. Also the food was awful the perfect margarita was terrible and it was very overpriced. 3.5/10
buckies next :)
These two have a strong friendship
This video was very satisfying
I liked that bit about the stuff
As a Norwegian i had never heard of Jimmy Buffet before this video. After watching the video i felt an incredible urge to check out the mythical title song. So i did. And to my great dismay i really enjoied it. Which lead me to check out his other songs, and i kinda loved it. So.... i guess im kind of a Jimmy Buffet fan now... Eddy.. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???!!
52:52 holy hell this whole scene was straight out of Bladerunner 2049
Ahh there’s nothing better than eating margaritaville with Jschlatt the homophobe 😎
Lol I got 40 minutes into this before I checked how long it was 😅 fantistic video Eddy!!
Do a every Hard Rock Cafe video
Surely not final!? there must be other theme restaurants you can visit?
So #1 on trending. That's neat.
#1 on trending rn, not bad Eddy! I just watched teds vid and now am fully locked in for yours😂
I was really distracted by you playing my favorite Vivaldi tune in the beginning.
so whens the third trip?
What's the name of the song playing during the New York scene? 42:30?
God I hate this place.... But I still.watched your video
The way the M&M looked around before blowing a kiss at Eddy wtf
If this becomes an annual tradition I am 100% down
do Hard Rock Cafe next
Now do every cheesecake factory in the country. Don't be a coward
am i the only one who gets drunk watching Eddy and acts like they're going on the road trip with him?......Just me?....okay...
now do all medieval times
I have GOT to point out how fantastic Eddy's Psychotic Break Stare is. My condolences for this video. Good work.\
Teds sheer bliss on the last few resturants are peak
18:20 I actually live near Panama City Beach !! Pier Park is so much fun, especially at night
"I'm going to every one in the country AND CANADAAAA"  ... I'm having deja vu... am I having deja vu?  I swear I've seen this before.
huh?
I hope you enjoyed Panama City we hate it here
Did y'all skip the Indianapolis one 🤔🧐
So bubba hump’s next?
I didn't go see it, but my local civic theatre did a production of a play called "Escape to Margaritaville." No clue what the plot was, but I'm betting you're gonna need an escape FROM Margaritaville after this one.
Please go to every Six Flags location
Ted being in the birthplace of Rainforest Cafe clearly gave him the vibes boost he needed for the end of the trip.
So to step it up again next year are you and Ted going to go every Hard Rock Cafe (in the U.S.)?  Everyone loves a trilogy
Hey Eddy, you probably wont see this, and it doesn't mean much, but this video made me laugh out loud and smile. And now a days that's hard for me. So thanks, and I'm sorry you had to go to every Margaritaville in American, I hope the views and revenue were worth suffocating on Jimmy Buffet for 1/12th of the year. God Bless yah man
Alternative title: I speed run food poisoning
No Palm Springs Margaritaville? It's a resort without the themed restaurant, they have a few bars and dining spots tho. Great video:) your dedication was entertaining!
give me one margarita…
you ever been camping?
Hearing eddy say the poutine was by far the best thing he had made me proud to be french canadian, and trust me not many things do.
I was today years old when I learned margaritaville is actually a thing and not just something in a song 😂
2:15 considering the last one did 8 million views, no, no i am not wondering that
I absolutely love how Ted's and Eddy's roles hace been reversed this time around. This time, Ted is the one in agony and Eddy is the one who's brainwashed, and then at the end it reverses AGAIN. Funny af as always, and holy shit, that green screen picture was funny as hell lol
One must imagine Sisyphus happy
Eddie dawg I think I was in Destin at the same time as u 😭I recognized those exact boats
Eddy reminds me of the green racecar from Cars
Now do every Denny's
As a teenager from Mississippi whose dad got fired from margaritaville for throwing a guy in a garbage can and tossing said man in the garbage can down the escalator, this gave me nostalgia almost like no other😭
Quick, someone think of another gimmicky restaurant chain with only a couple dozen locations across the country.
Not me thinking all the Margherita map pins on the thumbnail was a bunch of Samus helmets
Parked in that parking lot in Cleveland amd walked to the Margaritaville during my first and only trip to Cleveland 😂 BTW, what happened to the Margaritaville on Navy Pier???
Thank you for your sacrifice
Okay now go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the world
Lies he missed the one in oregon
Ooo ooo, do Bubba Gump Shrimp next!
There used to be a Margaritaville in Arizona at Westgate which is right next to our football stadium where Rihanna recently performed for the Super Bowl but we kicked Jimmy out for a standard, basic Mexican restaurant/bar named Salt. 😎
0/10 no margaritaville cruise
I went to the key west location as a kid and all i remember is an old man sitting at the bar in a speedo style swimsuit and nothing else. Wrinkly cheevks directly on the barstool and all.
Last Christmas Eve the weather got so bad at my house that we lost power and by extension, water (we have well water). So for Christmas (Eve), my family booked a hotel in Pigeon Forge (Tennessee's equivilent to Orlando, Florida) and spent Christmas Eve and Christmas there were we would have power and limitless showers. After everyone took a shower we went to find a place to eat, and decided on Margaritaville because everyone agreed that it would be funny. Upon arriving at the Margaritaville after navigating terrible traffic and an even worse road and parkinglot layout, we approached the Margaritaville to discover that minutes before we showed up, the watermain connection to the building had burst and the entire resturant was actively flooding. We then foound a different resturant to eat at and had a great time. This was the closest I've ever been to margaritaville.
dude youre crazy lol
Next James Buffet is gonna sponsor a video where you try his entire cannabis line and take the test for a pilot license
28:01 why is the footage reversed? It's soo funny
that unemployed friend on a tuesday
i'm glad him and ted are still friends
this is why i like eddy, he never punches anyone!
As a new Mexican, im so upset that I learned what "the thing..." is from a margaritaville video </3
DO DICKS LAST RESORT NEXT YEAR!!! THERES ONLY 13 OF THEM!!!!!
Fun fact: The ferris wheel in Pigeon Forge definitely caught fire a couple years back.
Next video: I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country
hm, For some reason now i feel like going to every single hello kitty cafe in america (this is a joke.)
Ted with a severe case of the Stockholm syndrome
let's see this become an annual thing
Which Margaritaville is the one they went to on the TV show Jury Duty?
Medieval times?
being a sardonic hipster is literally played out in 2023, are u [redacted]???
You stopped at my buccees in waller : )
https://youtube.com/@ddsofficial87
I work at the Mall of America in MN and after seeing the Rainforest Café video, I thought it’d be funny if you did this again but with Margaritaville or Hooters lol
You should do Dave and Buster's next. Just kidding, you will die of food poisoning. I'm not joking, I used to work there, you could get reeaally sick.
I would not suggest doing this again.. but if you do you should do TGI Fridays
I work on the Margaritaville Resort Orlando marketing team. You didn’t have to go this far to promote us, but you did and I couldn’t be any more thankful. Fins Up, brother! 🐬⬆️  EDIT: Rest in paradise, Jimmy! Thanks for taking us all to Margaritaville! ❤️
My uncle is jimmy buffet’s producer, hopefully this comment can get traction 😅
“The Thing” attraction is killing me oh my GOD
Just saying. There is a Margaritaville cruise that sails out of Florida
Why on earth would you rent a pickup truck to drive 9000 miles? It's like the worst vehicle choice. A sedan would save on fuel, and a SUV would give you covered cargo storage.
Omg, I HATED the cat in the hat ride, it was the scariest ride at Disney
i know you said final time but you gotta come back next year for Dicks Last Resort
Son of witch... He pulled it off again 🫡
The what if museum is the best surprise addition to any video 😭😭 Also if it helps these video series have reminded me of my childhood dream to go to these places
Omg #1 on trending, congrats!!!!!!!!!
7:00 Why get a truck when you're not gonna use the bed
How could you say this is the last trip when you haven't been to every Medieval Times?
realizing i was probs in atlanta at the same time as eddy for fbla nationals and i couldve met him because i walked by that margaritaville EVERY DAY
So what's the next chain restaurant?
"so now, for the second, and *final* time" eddy, don't kid yourself we know you're doing this again some time
do other states not have big ole puddles in their restaurants??
Petition to add the toes into a patreon reward
I've eaten at Margaritaville exactly once (the one in Cleveland) and was done about halfway through. The food wasn't bad per se but the constant Buffett music drove me insane. Props for pushing through all of this.
What about the margaritaville in bossier city Louisiana?
American History is really confusing.  I'm glad the Aliens ended the dinosaurs though; I'd be annoyed having to co-exist with them.
The obvious question: what restaurant is next?
Can we expect a "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country" video next year?
Deep Eddy’s is brewed in Austin! I’m surprised you didn’t see big billboards advertising it when you passed through
mario and luigi
I have been to the las vegas location, the tulsa location, and the PCB location. My parents love Margaritaville
@ 12:30 wasted opportunity to use the jumaji drums
As someone from Panama City Beach I can safely say that this is the most recognition our city has ever received
Pretty sure rhe first Margaritaville qas in Mississippi
i think that saying 'im not eating dinner right now' is a very good and classy way to decline an outing that may involve getting a bit to eat
I have been waiting my entire life for this video and I never knew it... Amazing 💙
Grew up in Florida. The Cat and the Hat ride was terrifying as a child, but it was even more terrifying when i was 22 and high for the first time ever and going on it. Still have flashbacks whenever i smell the dank. P.S. Looking forward to your worldwide McDonalds tour next year Eddy!
This was just what I needed to get through a stressful week at work. Thank you, Eddy and Ted.
Awesome video, wouldn't mind more of these, Eddy! I wish I had the time and money to go on a road trip like this myself, for leisure. Never did anything like that. :(
I have never been to a margaritaville but i did eat at a jimmy buffet Cheeseburger in paradise restaurant in Hawaii 2004. Was pretty good. Not sure if those are even around anymore.
omg I love buddy
Next you gotta complete the unholy trinity & go to every Hard Rock Cafe in America
Proud that Canada is having a good track record on these.
a "perfect margarita" isnt supposed to be "perfect" its a type of margarita made with patron and slightly different measurements
yikes ya missed Margaritaville Capitola
I'm absolutely in favour of you doing a Dollywood video. :3
So...Hard Rock Cafe next year?
Next year: we went to every Hard Rock Cafe on earth
Thank you for making this sacrifice. Im sure all of us wondered what the mental toll of going to all of one restaurant would do to a person. And now we know!
14:25 I just want you to know that every single local in that town just groaned. It’s pronounced Bil-lux-see. But I can’t fault you for not knowing
Now it's time to go to every hard rock cafe
Just unlocked memories didn't even know I had in San Antonio
oh no bro. you definitely pronounced biloxi wrong. It's Bill - UX - EE. I was born there. I'm in pain from this. biloxi can be explained by having to compete with the casinos -- the biloxi grand arcade is one of the highlights of my entire life. it had literally a hundred cabinets in the mid 90's -- and the goofy ass burping volcano has a history in other attractions from the mississippi gulf coast like the dragon that used to come out at the lady luck casino
why did you do this
Dear Eddy: Sorry. You shouldn't have come here, Two-Pin Eddy. -Cleveland.
As a Cleveland native I apologize for the hundreds of Tim Misny billboards in Cleveland
Liking before I even watch…I know this is going to be amazing
Watching this video and I already know the theme of Ted's experience is just going to be him loathing the road trip
I wish i had a pencil thin mustache
Cannot wait for Eddy to go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
The words you used to describe the Syracuse Margaritaville -- "probably the worst", "lifeless", and "below average" -- also perfectly describe the city of Syracuse as a native of the area.
Ever since you posted the rainforest cafe video, I was just waiting for you to post one similar. This was overall fun to watch and heartwarming. Keep up the great work Eddy!
Oh you went to every margaritaville in the country?  That’s weird, I didn’t see you go to the one in San Juan Puerto Rico airport
A masterpiece that somehow beat the precious masterpiece
So next you going to cheeseburger in paradise?
super cool! If i could make a suggestion for your next trip...? now do McDonalds I fckin dare ya  earn the award do it you can do it
This feels like mr beast without the money
They're actually building some gigantic margaritaville hotel and suites in my town! I hate it here!!
TIM MISNEY! One billboard and I know you're in Cleveland. Probably give him a call for the injuries you've experienced here.
I can’t believe it’s been a year since the Rainforest cafe video. Both of these videos came out while I’m work- traveling!
this was revenge for rainforest cafe. Ted realized and decided to play up how awesome Margaritaville is just to fuck with Eddy. I also love that everyone calls it the bean. Fuck Anish Kapoor.
My first thought on seeing this video was "Oh no Eddy, not again"
this was revenge for rainforest cafe. Ted realized and decided to play up how awesome Margaritaville is just to fuck with Eddy. I also love that everyone calls it the bean. Fuck Anish Kapoor.
40:00 i freak out just looking up at tall objects. i would have actually died of cardiac arrest if i was on that infernal wheel. thank you for letting me have minor freak-outs vicariously through you, eddy  48:13 i got married at the bean! i'm glad y'all were so happy to visit my favourite place in the world
But can you become the only two people who have been to every Rainforest Cafe, Margaritaville, and Hard Rock Cafe?
As someone from Panama City Beach it is incredibly surreal to see my weird kitschy hometown framed as a haven of respite in this sea of madness
TOU DIDNT GO TO THE SANDUSKY ONE
Bubba gump next
That was Deep, Eddy.
48:26
I used to live in Biloxi, way back in the day... Never heard anyone pronounce it that way, lol. We all said "Buh-luhx-ie."
as someone from syracuse i was fucking *waiting* for you to say it was the worst one and i feel so validated. people get shot at that mall all the time too lol
I can’t wait for next years “Every HardRock”
Art comes in many forms- *and this is the best form*
I've been to Margaritaville in New Orleans, that was a hell of a trip. I also got a drink at the one in Key West once, funny to see Eddy exploring areas I know.
Sooo are we just going to act like you didn't just skip over the Margaritaville hotel in Jacksonville?
Should have done Planet Hollywood on the way. What's with the random Aussie lol. I've met Jimmy at multiple bars, multiple times, in my area. I have even sung a song with him because I knew the band playing. None of those run ins were at a Margaritaville.
i am in santa cruz, ca where the only margaritaville not owned by jimmy buffet exists. i knew they weren’t going to visit it but i was kind of hoping they would 😅
There’s a margaritaville cruise too
52:58 “ you look lonely, I can fix that”
In five years they will be going to every mc donalds in the USA and Canada
You rented a vehicle to go across the country, and picked one of the smallest least comfortable pick up trucks available 😭
pt 3 at Hard Rock Cafes? 34 in the US...
just so you know - there’s now a margaritaville in southern oregon
Next up... Going to all 27 6 flags in Canada, Mexico, and the US!!   There are 24 in just the US if you aren't up for multiple countries. I'd love to know how redundant and annoying eating only theme park food for an entire trip would be and you Eddy are the perfect guinea pig for the people who need to know.
You should try going to every Burger King.
Hard Rock Cafe
I wanna know where I can get the hoodie Eddy is wearing at the Niagara Falls location
every bubba gump
“Second and final” yeah right eddy, we’ll see you at every bubba gump shrimp company
“Second and final” yeah right eddy, we’ll see you at every bubba gump shrimp company
So what your telling me is blonde stranger is Kmart escape(the piña colada song)
If you ever do a third one of these, I'd love to see all the Dick's Last Resorts in the country. Would be interesting to see the differences in the servers in each location.
My one takeaway from this video is that walkable shopping streets are a tourist attraction in America
that intro gave me deja vu
he did it again.
Forgot  Margaritaville in Missouri Ozark
Thank you for your service 🫡
A lot of Buffett songs have to do with hangovers (including Margaritaville). Not even the man himself would've survived this expereince without some discomfort!  As someone who has listened to objectively too much Jimmy Buffett, I don't think he's a relentless optimist, but he's very good at rolling with the punches. - Clearly so are you!
I couldn’t help but watch because this video popped up every time I open YouTube. So, here y go… leave me alone.
Im pretty sure he only did this because this and jungle cafe are next to each other in the Mall of America lol
I worked as a tourist photographer for like a week at the Chicago Margaritaville
I'm glad you've enjoyed both times in New Mexico. Did you swim in the blue hole?
Thank you for your service. I did 2 tours in Vietnam, 2005 and 2006
so anyone else looking forward to what their gonna do next year
poor guy at 52:11
Your self reflection day was the same day you had diarrhea!?! Also, loved the surprise return to Rainforest Cafe. Please, don't let this be the final one! I love these!
Man, Canada has a Margaritaville, but Washington doesn’t???? This is some bull.
Hold up, they didn't hit the one in Palm Springs CA.
Next you should triple it and go to every mcmenamins in the contry
Hard Rock next??
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next please
This series will end with you killing Ted
Ayy shoutout to my fellow Brayden
Oh boy. Just finished the counter part and here I go at 2 in the morning…
It's ironic cause Eddy kinda looks like Bucky
The sequel we didn't ask for, but the one we needed. Very good.
I swear these Eddy road trip videos are better than game of thrones
Great video but why did you rent a Tacoma?
Eddy burback go to sinaloa
I have to say Eddy, you and Ted using 24 days of your life to create 1 video is dedication. Thank you for your sacrifice
*cough* Hawaii *cough*
Bro no way I literally just bought my sister the limited edition margaritaville crocs for her 21st birthday and then this video comes out on her birthday???
22:09 the dangers of VR have made themselves apparent, he must be stopped.
I knew I saw you.
Amaaaaazing. I can't believe you went for a round 2. Good video man.
Next year: I went to every McDonald's in my city.
every McDonalds
“The 2nd and FINAL road trip” he says… until there was another road trip for another limited restaurant chain! XD
I knew you were working on something devious but this is too far
52:52 blade runner lmaooo
I work at Universal Orlando and literally had no idea that that plane was actually HIS plane lmfao
The traffic. The early kitchen closure. So Atlanta.
Last week my uncle mentioned how there was a margaritaville opening up in Boston. I didn't know what Margaritaville was. Now I can't wait to go experience this restaurant not enjoy any of the food
Lmao why the hell did you rent a truck instead of something 10 times more practical and comfortable and cheap? That's more confusing to me than the urge to do this trip lmao.
Danny is my favorite marvel cameo 😂
Do dicks last resort next there's only 12 of them though but it'd be interesting to see what location roasts the best
as a former functioning alcoholic and man who ate literal garbage it's always so interesting to see how having a few drinks a few days in a row and some mid ass food affects a normal human being. fascinating. hope your tum tum feels better brother!
See you next year when you do Bubba Gump Shrimp 🫡
holy shit wait watching this and seeing you pass my work in Niagara falls was so funny hahaha. glad you enjoyed NF
Great video!! Cant wait for the road trip next year!
Props to the manager that helped them out. I've been in food service and that is super clutch of them to do that.
Hear me out: Hard Rock Cafe
Why would you take a pickup truck again...
#1 on trending is insane
look buddy, I'm the idiot that pays for premium on this platform and I think I DESERVE to see those dogs frolic
Between Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe, I'm starting to feel like these big corporate chain tourist trap restaurant/casino/resorts are allergic to the Pacific Northwest and I'm wondering what happened to scare them all away.  At least we're still clinging onto a Great Wolf Lodge.
Is watching this video incentivizing Eddy to torture himself for views? Is it kind of like watching a Mission Impossible film and incentivizing Tom Cruise to throw himself off of things?  Also, what... they rented a truck? For a cross country road trip? That seems like it would add thousands of unnecessary dollars to the trip...
the rainforest cafe nam flashbacks had me dead
That first margaritaville used to be a Gladstones where a server dared me to drink as much diet coke as I could, then I nearly peed myself on the studio tour, and I couldn't get to the bathroom because Michael Jackson had taken Blanket to Universal studios that day and they were using the bathroom and the crowd was between me and the bathroom. I didn't end up pending myself but yeah. Samw vibe as this vid
i love you
Great video! But whyd you meet  up with Danny Gonzales twice?
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
I don't know why this is so compelling, but it is
someone needs to clean the bean
Buddy is the goat of this video
Who are you and where can i get more of this road trip content. I am currently foaming at the mouth and in dire need of scenic views of the united states highways  and criticisms of poorly named menu items.
I feel like they'd enjoy the hard rock cafe
When are you gonna do Subway?
Eddy do another restaurant trip next year
I loved your last video so much that I shared it with my friends and we planned a weekend around going to the rainforest cafe in vegas for my friend's birthday last november. Long story short, we aren't friends anymore lol but seeing you go through this again gave me the urge to go to a margaritaville but I think I'm going to resist the urge this time lmao
Can't wait for next year, all McDonald's tour
Eddy only mentions paying the check once  Whay about all the other times?
I can’t wait for you guys to go to all 33 Hard Rock Cafe next year.
You brought back horrible memories of the cat in a hat ride
Do the Hard Rock Cafes next you coward. Europe or it doesn't count
Did Eddy and Ted switch bodies for this one lol?
THANK YOU FOR THANKING THE PEOPLE WHO FEED YOU❤
Well I guess I am watching this and Ted's video again
I wonder what people think when grown ass folks come in filming all excited to sit at the boat table. Hilarious
54:13 yup that’s New Mexico alright
Margaritaville tequila is better than any regular price name brand, their silver tequila is my go to!! As a native Floridian whos been in Sacramento CA for 15 years this really hit for me about half way through. I shutter to think about the final legs of this journey, away from the beach and the sunsets!
Biloxi is...not pronounced that way 😅, but glad you enjoyed your stay here! Mississippi usually gets no love
Living in AZ my entire life and I always saw “The Thing” signs and never went. Idk what I was expecting but it definitely was not that…
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Thank you for your service
I love your videos so much but I was wondering if you could do some more movie reactions I have a really good suggestion Kung fury. It’s the best movie I’ve ever seen and it’s hilarious. It’s bad good.
Amazing video! Meow
Glad you had a great time in Minnesota lots of fun memories 😂
He better do Bubba Gump next
Now hear me out, every hard rock cafe in THE WORLD!
You... YOU SONNOVABITCH!!  Not Jimmy Buffett. NOT JIMMY BUFFETT!!!
That's a lot of a lot
Watching Eddy go to my childhood Margaritaville that I begged my mom to go for my birthday every year was crazy. Shout out PCB and Pier Park
Knowing that I sat at the same table as the dude with the mosutahe warms me to my very core
Jimmy Buffett must have the best fucking time, I can't even imagine.
Every McDonald’s in the us next?
Number ONE on trending lets fucking GOOO dude!!
I made a batch of margaritas and watched Ted & Eddy’s videos back to back while taking a drink every time they mentioned getting a marg at a new location.  I’ll just say, get a group together and make it a game to take a drink each time they drink too for the two videos. It’s a fun time. 🍸
Every Bubba Gump next year?
Looks like there are 22 bubba gump shrimps in the US...plus a lot international
i feel like there has to be a third one, so whats the third massive chain themed restaurant?
I like the Dicks Last Resort teaser...
Seeing the title after the rainforest cafe video just made my brain yell oh my god eddy no don't do this to yourself again 😭
Ted can't melt steel beams
56:30 “Turns out I can experience true joy like Jimmy, but only when I’m done doing a thing that I have to do.” This was definitely not something you had to do. Eddy you did this by choice. Remember that.
What a crazy bender. I’m glad it was recorded, but never do this again man. It’s so bad for you.
wait til he finds out about the margaritaville cruise line
i’m just happy to see jakey
do mcdonalds next
Eddy let this be a life lesson, don't buy seafood in non-coastal cities. It's like a 50-50 gamble every single time.
Now you need to go to every bubba gump
What else did you do in San Antonio?
Wow, this is the number 1 trending video currently.  Great job Eddy.
You masochist
Better man than me I’d be getting black out drunk at every location
As a Myrtle Beach resident, I'm glad you spent as little time here at possible. Being here is prob what drained you the most lol
If you love margaritaville, Like this comment*
But did Eddy have a last shaker of salt?
Dark Margaritaville welcomes Eddy’s soul
the man hiding at 52:12 LMAOO
Was it worth it?
Score two for Canada, the Canadian restaurant is better! Now, you should visit every *Medieval Times* restaurant. Not only do you have to sit through a 3 hour show, you also have to go to the Canadian one too!
Medieval times only has 10 locations.   How many fried turkey legs can a man eat?
Highlight Buddy the dog. Great video
Part 3: Bubba Gumps Shrimp
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but Atlanta has two different Margaritavilles one in the city downtown and one up at Lake Lanier.
Goodbye Beachbum Burback. See you next year at every Hard Rock Cafe
I'd like to know how Eddy escaped the bathroom
Was that the atlanta margaritaville that was so nice to y’all? I’m gonna on over there and give them hella good reviews!!!
bastard stopped in Biloxi and I missed my chance.
You need to eat at every bubba gump shrimp company in the United States.
why did you decide this is what you wanted to do to yourself thanks though
wierdly fascinating to see as a non-american. i have never even heard of this chain before, now I know more than i ever needed to.  also, the thing place is kinda cool.
Yeaaaaaa atlanta traffic be like that
I genuinely can't wait for next year's road trip
Idk how many are left or there scarcity but you should do Chuck E. Cheese
You’re telling me ned, eddy, AND schlatt where all in San Antonio and I DIDNT get to see them??
YOU ABSOLUTE MAD LAD YOU DID IT TWICE?? UNHINGED LEGEND
First of all, I am from Florida and the rain IS a big deal. You're so valid for that.   So, last year I was a Universal Orlando season pass holder, and my friends and I have this entire like, cult following for the Cat in the Hat ride. There were 5 of us total which is exactly how many adults you can squeeze into that fever dream. I'm here to tell you 1. they actually nerfed the part where the cart sort of whips you around recently—it used to be a harsher motion (I guess someone had issues on it? Unclear) and 2. absolutely nothing could have hit home more for me that seeing you highlight something so stupid and weird that managed to become so personal to me and my best friends.   I adore these long-form roadtrip videos. They perfectly capture so many things that feel intrinsically American, for good or ill (and maybe there are other places with the same vibe! I can only speak to my own experiences). They're just an honest slice of what extended travel is like through huge chunks of the country, and a lot of it is draining and inconvenient and awful, but a lot of it is cryptic billboards leading to even more cryptic museums, and gas station-theme park hybrids, and random King Kong statues in the middle of Tennessee.   To call this type of video a love letter to road trips or Americana or consumerism or any of that would feel inaccurate, but so would saying there's no element of that in them. There's just something that to me is very beautiful about seeing the experiences I've had mirrored even partially in someone else's life. Cat in the Hat, the statues in Pigeon Forge, even the Florida rain storms.   I'm not sure why the Margaritaville Video has me waxing poetic on a Thursday night, but I think Jimmy would think it's alright.   P.S. I love Ted casually rocking a "The Thing?" shirt at 36:52
MYRTLE BEACH GANG WISH I COULDVE RAN INTO YOU PAUSE NO HOMO BUT MYRTLE BEACH GANG
WHAT EDDY WENT TO MY HOMETOWN IN MS WHATTT
Ted is the greatest
They have an amazing breaded chicken and potatoes
I just started the video, and I'm already excited
Now do every McDonalds in the USA. Unless you're scared
Watching the Rainforest cafe videos and this back to back like Barbenheimer
What about something more stimulating? Every big zoo in the country? Cincinnati, Brooklyn, San Diego, Omaha, even the more theme park ones like Animal Kingdom?
fun fact; the thing used to have a real curcofagas at the end, they changed it tho lol
Bubba gump next?😂
Cool. Now do every McDonalds
I know you don’t want to do this again but…… Cheesecake Factory 😏
TECHNICALLY you didn't go to every Margaritaville, there's an unaffiliated(?) Mexican restaurant by that name in Capitola, California.  That said this is incredible dedication, thanks for bringing us this wonderful content
wait margaritaville is a resturaunt?? I thought it was a town in Florida or something
these look like elaborate money laundering schemes
I feel the same way going to Time Square
Not final time. I’m calling a cap.
Saw the map at the start; and now I know why I have never heard of this restaurant. Their nowhere near me.
Now do Waffle House
god the sequel we did not deserve. god bless you eddy
I watched the last ones Ed -> Ted, so I must watch these in the same order.
Wow your energy when Ted's loving it and you want to kill him is something I can really relate to. I never hate someone more than when they're loving a shared experience and I'm not. What's their problem.
Genius. This series is 🔥
Blade Runner 2049 moments Eddy Burback edition 42:55 , 52:52 lol - great video, dude!
So what’s next you guys going to every bubba gump in the us and Canada?
Well looks like next year's will be Hard Rock Cafe
Would you say every toilet you used along the way was living it up in margaritaville??
omg, thats jarvis johnson! i love his videos
do you guys think tony and eddy dressed in matching outfits on purpose or was a… twaccident🤨
as an Orlando resident I can confirm that the cat in the hat ride gave me ptsd.
Holyshit
This is my type of content
As a parrothead, im happy to see this was the next restaurant picked. As a rational human being, im worried for yalls sanity.
Do it for McDonald’s
Next time Eddy is going to every Applebee's, I can feel it. (Very good job Mr Burback)
Wasting away again in Margaritaville
I passed one in Capitola, CA that you guys missed haha
WOOOO TIM MISNY REP WOOOOOO
Every 👏 McDonalds 👏 in 👏 the 👏 country! 👏🎉
Funfact, there is also a Margaritaville retirement community near Hilton Head SC. My grandparents lived there for a bit.
Threeeeee times!
This is such a great family experience to have a close… cllossee….. clahhoup-ah  pppooouurrr mmmmeeee ssommmtthhiiing taaallll annd strong make it-ah...a.. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!
wait what about the margaritaville in Palm Springs 😢
Can't wait for the Hard Rock Café tour next year
this is insane because i was literally in margaritaville in destin last week
i just rewatched the rainforest cafe this is a DREAM COME TRUE
52:48 Eddy really thought he could put a scene from blade runner 2049 and we wouldn't notice
Do you get to keep the blender cup that the drink in Key West came in?
This proves you learned nothing and I'm here for it. As someone from Chicago, I love that you troll on the bean.
i know you said final time, but if you do another tour, Bubba gump?
Just started the video and I would just like to say how much I appreciate the amount of dramatic Vivaldi is playing in this video. Truly beautiful.
2:09 Why does this feel like a movie trope
i have lived in the PBC/Destin area my whole life and i have never been more excited for a review!!
What about the one in gatlingburg tn
The ribs at the St Thomas location were 9.1 / 10 . Surprisingly good
I love people not from Arizona discovering the thing. It's a WILD ride.
Stand still traffic going into Atlanta? Yeeeeeep nothing new there.
committed 2 Texas sins,  1 ordering fish over steak 2.having money left over after going to bucc"s and not smearing you blood on the statue as a contract to show your devotion to the beaver
1 one on trending based purely on suffering
I can’t believe we were in the same city
if you think rain is slippery, come to michigan in november, maybe december, definitely january, march, april and some of may when it’s snowing
This is sooo chaotic loll! I cannot . It’s bad with y’all stuff
Thx for hitting up Ontario, CA
Do Applebees
What kind of moron? My kind of moron, I love this man ( you decide how).
next go to every dicks last resort plz :)
SOMEONE GET THIS MAN A SALAD
Hold my brabant...
I still remember going on the cat in the hat ride as a kid. It is so unnecessarily dark and scary.
Take a shot of your margarita every time Eddy says "Margaritaville".
We all gangster til the Hard Rock Cafe calls
was that fuickinbg vangellis
This makes me feel anxiety and despair in a way I can't understand.
Every McDonald's in the USA when?
Sooo when are you going to all the Bubba Gump Shrimps?
Wait, wait. What happened at the Margaritaville in New Orleans!? I was so invested when you were approaching my city and then you just gloss over it and skip to Biloxi!? BILOXI?! I actually don't care, I'm glad you had a good time. Party on.
Y’all should do Senor Frogs!!! There is around 20! It’s technically not a road trip bc you have to fly to some locations!!!
truly bold of eddy and ted to embark on yet another trip just a year later. o7 to the tummys that hurt during the making of this video
all the little bits like the one with the green m&m really make this video amazing
They missed the one at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri :/
The review for Margaritaville in Syracuse can just be said for Syracuse in general
I love these semi yearly uploads where its just Eddie travelling around eating at very random what seem to be like out of the way, like how do you just decide you wanna eat at *every* Margaritaville in both the USA and Canada??
So you went on vacation for a month and just ate at one place?
The way you pronounced Biloxi took 15 years off my life 💀
hear me out: Hard Rock Cafe
Eddy, my guy, you didnt get a truck cover, there is nothing their
I really love and appreciate the fact that you did this again gave me major nostalgia from last summer when you did the first one much appreciation for you Eddy
44:47 me, a spencer's employee: YEAH FUCK THAT PLACE
i love these so much. i want to see more.
Came for Eddy, stayed for Buddy. Good Dog.
Now do McDonalds
We had a Cheese Burger in Paradise in California, MD which was also Jimmy Buffet themed restaurant as well.
Gotta do Bubba Gumps next! You know it'll be worth it haha
There is a margaritaville in San Diego
I died at the green screen pic
I like the length of this one but probably preferred the rainforest cafe one more, something about the energy in this seemed lacking. It was still good and hope you get good responses from everyone but yeah this didn't really entice me to sub.
26:48 sounding like the joker
Ya’ll skipped the Margaritaville on pensacola beach!!!
gonna be honest here only 3 mins in the video but you seem pretty upset to be having a second once in a life time roadtrip not eveyone can drop everyhting for a year and hit up maragritaville and rainforest cafe
I literally got an ad for one of the Margritaville resorts because of watching both your and Ted's videos. I started cackling when you quoted Luda's first line in Baby
I’m just realizing as a parrot head some of the locations like Biloxi are places his lyrics are about
Please why did you miss the Palm Springs location
Run it back next year! 2024 is the year of the Cheesecake Factory!!!
The hard rock
Literally all I know of Jimmy Buffett is when he went on South Park and sang "Aids Burger In Paradise"
Was just settling in to rewatch the Rainforest Cafe video and this just happens to come up before I even have a chance to search… excellent
Calling it now, next year he's going to do another chain that has slightly more locations than Margaritaville, people sayin hard rock but are really as branded as these other two? I'm not American so I've never seen a Hard Rock Cafe.
*Eddy holding a gun to his own head* I can't believe you guys made me do this again.
Wow! This is why YouTube was invented!!
God this was great I can’t wait for you to eat at every TGI Fridays next
You say Syracuse like a nerd
Now you have to go to every Medieval Times location in the country and Canada. There are 10… and you guys would dig it.
next time, dicks last resort see yous in 2024 buck -o
next start hard rock cafe?
I’m really just out here manifesting a Hard Rock Cafe world tour…. pretty please..
Does anyone realize how rare it is that a random person would be scrolling YouTube at 1am, they see an hour long video posted by a channel they’ve never heard about before, but they continue to watch the entire video? Wtf is this???? I subbed tho.
I vote for Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next
eddy are u kidding i live in biloxi and i’m so mad
Eddy: second and final road trip Also Eddy next year: I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the country
"The day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea?"
as someone raised on jimmy buffet music, seeing y’all discovering the cult that is margaritaville, has been amazing
eddie burback
Pretty sure you actually died for a minute and ended up in purgatory twice now. I'm surprised they let you film there.   Ted should get that tinnitus checked out.
Eat at every single McDonald's in america next
Next year do Bubba Gump!
As someone from the Gulf, I took psychic damage from Eddy's pronunciation of Biloxi 😭 It's "buh-LUCK-see" (blame the French, lol)
Guys look, Eddy Burback uploaded
I had no fucking Idea Margaritaville even existed what the actual hell is this. This feels like a dream. Why can't I wake up.
My husband and I just wanted this comment to count as engagment because... well damn you deserve something for all that effort... so yeah... grats, oh and a like (alredy subscribed we already subscribed a while back)
Stay strong man
Wow ok Eddy
Eddy, my boy, why again?
NOO EDDY YOU GOT DUPED BY THE THING 😭 /hj  tbh tho every single road stop is worth it otw to new mexico !! theyre stocked full of stuff it's super cool (make sure 2 look for native-made tags on jewelry!! most things r made in china/etc)
I'm convinced America isn't real and I don't wanna none of Buc-EE's nonsense
Next year… Bubba Gump?
#1 on trending! Let’s go dude! Good job!
I can't tell you how excited i was to see you did this again.  I really hope this is a really thing.
Eddy forgot another Margaritaville in Georgia
I have only been to one and it was the one in Atlanta and all of the staff were super nice even though it was smack busy due to the huge convention right next dooe
23andMe told my friend their closest famous relative was Marie Antoinette. Mine was Jimmy Buffett. 🙃
This was the best
52:58 reminds me of that scene in bladerunner 2049 when Ryan Gosling is staring at that giant hologram lady. 😂 can somebody recreate that meme with eddy and the green MnM?
You liked it. No, you loved this trip.
as a pcb local that frequents pier park, i completely forgot we had a margaritaville and when you brought it up i almost dropped dead. i cant believe i missed eddy burback in my hometown 💔
Can't wait til next year when you go to all the Planet Hollywoods in the US!
Wait...so why didn't they go to the Margaritaville in Shreveport? It is a casino/hotel one like the one in Tulsa. Does it not have an actual Margaritaville restaurant in it? They could have pretty easily stopped there between San Antonio and Mississippi.
those are frozen pollack fillets, we have served them at our place but in something, not actually as fish and chips. I think it was a fish sandwich or something
Watching 2 hours of Margaritaville content has made me question my sanity.
A true magnum opus
Eddy Bearback . . .Nuff' Said
This vid was so good I sent it to my mom. She’s been a long-time buffet fan so I’m hoping she’ll like it!
I guess the real margaritaville was the marga we Rita along the
As an Ohioan in the Cleveland area I knew that misny makes them pay sign the moment you showed it
hi
Now you and Ted have to fight the staff at every Waffle House in the US.
How is Ted not eddys boyfriend. I thought he was for most of this video
Bullshit this is the last there's gotta be more themed restaurants out there, this is now a yearly thing
This is the best film on cult indoctrination since Midsommar
I can't wait if they travel to every hard rock cafe in the country if there doing themed restaurants tour.
Go in Debt by spending $100 at every Dave&Busters in the country and Canada.
My only experience at one of these had a live band taking requests so I requested bring me to life by evanescence as a joke and was given the best cover of it by this 2 person band
I can’t wait for the Hardrock Cafe world tour grand finale next year
These little road trip videos always having the same vibe as an Avengers crossover movie.
Just keep it between the navigational B cups
Me and my partner considered going to the footnote Margaritaville in Syracuse for drinks once while at that mall (which I still call Carosel Mall because it was a better name), but it seemed entirely underwhelming and I think we went elsewhere. Little did I know....
Can't wait for every Hard Rock Cafe next year
You monster
Omg ya boi made it to my state of GA.
Next challenge, every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the US.
Imagine going to every McDonalds in the country
You should visit every Kutcharitaville in the US. They have the best key lime pies! The Goody Goody Cheeseburger is also a must try!
There’s actually one here at a casino in downtown Cincinnati, but I’ve been and it was also… fine. You didn’t miss anything
I think the next episode should be bubba bump shrimp!!
My takeaway from this is that Margaritaville is overwhelmingly mediocre but the beach will always be awesome.
I can't believe you didn't get a plate of safari fries.
They say this is the last time they travel the country for a chain restaurant, but next year we’ll get a video titled, “We ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the Country”
Your manic take on PMA "positive mental attitude" is really heartwarming
SYRACUSE MENTIONED!!!! 🚩🚩🎆🥳🟠
I’m from Florida and yeah the rain is terrible because no one knows how to drive in rain
Watching in a margaritaville rn
35:49 those staff are so sweet! Also this is another video I can add to my comfort watch routine! The playlist is just both rainforest cafe videos and now both margaritaville videos
Love this video!!
Hey, are you ok?
I saw misny and immediately knew you were in Cleveland
fun fact, my parents met at a jimmy buffet concert    I exist because of that guy
I just thought Margaritaville was a country radio show my dad sometimes listens to in the car
I went to the Miami one and it is a part of this really weird mall that’s always under constructions there was also wild chickens chilling in the outside area and a rooster cockadodalling every few minutes it was magical
You're nuts bro. I can't believe you did this a second time. Lol
I live less than an hour from the one in PC and I'm a great fan of Jimmy Buffett
Thank you for visiting San Antonio eddy. We don’t get enough love here from non locals so your money… I mean your visit was much appreciated!
These videos have reminded me of a place in Utah called The Mayan where they served Mexican food and had divers from big cliffs and you are on multiple levels. I think I only went with friends!
Plz do Hard Rock Cafe
Eddy needs to go to the South Lake Tahoe location when it opens later this year 😂
Bubba Gump’s next
Its fitting part of your problems truly started in nyc because that Margaritaville is about to foreclose kinda regret never going but hey it may stay open
Eddy if y’all wanna go to every medieval times hmu and I can get you a discount
i grew up going to myrtle beach for march break from canada so i’ve only been to that margaritaville. naturally i assumed the giant blender hurricane that goes off every 15 minutes and disturbs your meal was a staple for every location and finding out that isn’t true now is so upsetting :(
jesus eddy. why do you keep doing this to yourself.
Next up, Eddie and Ted should visit every Margarita GRILL in the country (there’s only one and it’s in the middle of Alabama)
*whispers* he doesn’t know about the margaritaville in the Detroit Airport
soooooo hard rock next year? or perhaps outback? may i suggest… mcdonalds?
When my wife has FOMO annoyance of all my laughing an chuckling, i must rate this video a two thumbs up
on my 12th birthday i asked for a milkshake at the PCB location and i am pretty sure it was the same consistency as a bushwhacker
35:15 this is so kind of them I love that they were like "man if they doing a video we gotta make good food for em"
He should visit every chipotle or tacobell in the US 😂
Bruh u skipped the Bossier Margaritaville!?
An absolute work of art
Eddy going to the giant pistachio and the thing have completed my childhood road-trip nostalgia. My dad playing dumb hyping up the thing for me as a kid is a core memory
THIS IS WHAT I DESERVE!!!!!!
Next year “I went to all the hard rock cafes in America and Canada!!!!” There’s 35 I think maybe 36
Bubba Gump is up next year.
No one gonna talk about how that kid had the same fit on an entire year apart on the same day he met eddy both times???? Aight then
The combination of Jimmy Buffett and Vivaldi is absolutely unhinged. Good video!
Every Hard Rock Cafe restaurant in America (and one in Canada) next year? 😂
Next year? BUBBA GUMPS
Eddy please stop, you don’t have to shoulder all of our burdens, let us share the load
50:23 while eddys being traumatized by the rainforest Cafe, I'm suffering ptsd from seeing the Crayola Experience 😅 the bright neon shirt in the clip before was enough to set me off
Eddy, hate to break it to ya, but there's a Margaritaville in Phoenix
so did you find that lost shaker of salt?
52:50 …and like the song, it comes full circle. Truly, a poetic moment.
Eddy went from slowly loosing their sanity on the Rainforest cafe, to trying to find Faith on Margaritas and proclaiming Jimmy Buffet as his prophet.
I thought the pins on the map were Samus's helmet. I'm sorry.
its fun to watch a guy who has no idea how to travel find it difficult to drive around to margaritaville's
Listen Eddie. A tummy ache on a trip  is the worst. If you have a tummy ache at home you can rest at home, but if youre on a trip with an itinerary you might have to have a tummy ache in the car.  I understand your pain
Living the American dream my guy.
See you in a year for every Hard Rock Cafe.
Do medieval times next
Wish you could’ve experienced more of Myrtle Beach!
PCB is the only one I’ve eaten at, but pier park is my childhood
McDonald’s next😊
Ted seems like the type who would start enjoying something just out of spite.
Next time has to be going to all the Hard Rock Cafe’s in the country.
My family just went on a roadtrip from Ohio to alabama to visit relatives and we stopped at two Bucees… we lost people both times… on top of the fact that at one they had a mascot standing right outside the bathroom taking photos with people... It was a weird experience
No way is this the final you still have all the midevil times restaurants
okay fuck the margaritaville stuff, THE THING?????? WTF EVEN WAS THAT
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. trip 2024?
Yeah it may have sucked but I watched both videos soooo
If going to every rainforest cafe wasn’t enough he had to go to every margaritavile in America and Canada.
Petition to eat at every cracker barrel in the county all 660 locations 😅
Go to every McDonald’s and you have content for the next decade
Truly a masterpiece of cinematic excellence. Well done.
Blatant copy of famous youtuber Ted Nivison. Truly shameful.
I'm calling it now. Next year it's every Dicks last resort in the US
I can't wait for the Medieval Times video next year!
Complete the trilogy. Do bubba gumps
it would be really fun to see them waddle around dollywood
WHY HAHAHAAHHAHAHAAHA
As a Florida man, the entire Florida section felt like an authentic experience. Thunderstorms, weirdos on the street, random chickens, theme parks. Sounds about right.  Edit: Wow this really took off. RIP Jimmy, it's almost like Eddy performed your last rites on his pilgrimage. It's a good thing he's done doing these kinds of vids or Mark Wahlberg might be next
I ate at one.  I'll never eat at one again.  it was horrible.
why is this #1 on trending? I thought I was being ironic by watching an hour video on a restaurant I've never been to. Turns out I'm basic AF
Eddy my life has been so empty. Thank you my sweet boy. Blessed.
Back at it again in margaritaville
this version is so much more hinged than Ted's
Thrilled that Cleveland icon Tim Misney makes a short appearance in this video
"I'm from the suburbs of Chicago" Me, from the suburbs of Chicago: Where 👁👁
we are not worthy
13:48 Thats crazy :0
hard rock cafe next year
Alternate title: "Eddy Destroys His Liver"
I can’t wait for the inevitable “we visited every MCDonalds episode”
The sequel we didn't know we needed.
Please go to all the Buccees.
😢Hum jaise chote Youtube ko koi nai support karta 🙂💔
As someone from Mississippi, i never expected us to get some rep from people i watch. love yall
Felt real dread when you mentioned Syracuse. So sorry you had to experience that. I live here. That’s where my first date happened (the mall, not Margaritaville. there was not a second date). I’m glad you survived.
next year do every McDonalds in the country & Canada lol
man ran it back just to ensure i follow him. real
Cannot explain how excited I was to see this pop up in the feed.
these are my fav videos
dang eddy that shirt looked real good on you, 100% certified smoochable
God bless
Eddy and Ted road trip part 3: We ate at every Waffle House in the US and Canada
After watching both videos, I still have no idea who tf Jimmy Buffett is
ART.
I just realized I’ve been to 3 of these and I feel like that’s too many
Well we all can say at least its not every McDonald’s
Your storytelling within these adventures is truly something special. You should definitely do this a third time to make it a trilogy. But instead of a specific chain maybe change it to regional restaurants that are similar. Like Inn & Out vs Whataburger or something. And then specifically seek out the FIRST of each location. Just spit ballin’. Appreciate the dedication and hard work!
Aye, I'm a tour guide in Niagara Falls so it's cool to see you were here for a bit. Heard terrible things about our Margaritaville so I never bothered to try it but maybe now I'll give it shit!
I'm not gonna lie, I think Eddy really was pulling that hat off nicely
Every Bubba Gump Shrimp 2024?
waiting for Chuck E cheese 🙏
Shoving this into my happy playlist
Please don’t ever do this again you’re killing yourselves for the oddest reasons 😂
When I saw the thumbnail for this video I swear to god I screamed like a little girl. When I showed my girlfriend these freaks had done it again, we postponed watching star wars in Lou of this testament to the human stomach.
Having a margarita with my gf rn 👍🏻
babe. he did it again. wake up.
52:59 "You look lonely"
Some people go to church to find god.  Some go to Margaritaville to find Jimmy Buffet.
* continent US and Canada counts as North America, that's a continent my dude
As SOON as you said you were heading to Atlanta I knew you were going to hit one of our world famous traffic jams.  Seriously, driving here SUCKS.
The Mall of America fever dream was incredible
What next? Bubba Gump Shrimp?
@47:12: Nobody else will rag on you while simultaneously gassing you up quite like Black people. What a highlight, I snort-laughed!
babe wake up new video of eddie pushing himself to the brink of insanity just dropped
My favorite part is when you tried to make Chicago look cool, but it's really a shit hole created by our elected officials
You know, it's kinda weird that leaving a relative's house in a Chicago suburb with food poisoning is an experience we can relate with each other
Wow dude you wasted a short part of your life doing this useless video.. thank you..
The fact that eddy is from Chicago and me from Wisconsin learning that he goes to wisconsin dells made my midwestern heart full thank you- a Wisconsinite (cheesehead) 🫶
I went to a Bukees coming home from a trip to Flordia wirh our high school marching band. As someone who has extremely high anxiety, i walked into the bukees, and my anxiety was SO BAD. I hated it in there. My friend and i were only in ghere for about 10 minutes, and we both HATED it. Do t understand the hype around it, but whoever likes this place, keep doing you
Now do every mcdonalds in the country and Canada
What about Margaritaville at Lake Lanier islands just above Atlanta??
Do Bubba Gump next!
Number 1 on trending. Congratulations Eddy
So you didn't learn from your Rainforest Cafe marathon 😂 good.
"i ate at every mcdonald on earth" when?
Pigeon forge is cool and I've been to dollywood. It was also cool. Never did eat at the margaritaville at the island, but I have had Dicks Last Resort which I highly recommend. Basically the theme is the staff there are just rude and it's amazing cuz it's hilarious.
I kept getting this video recommended today and I was like "why is youtube suggesting a video I already watched?" I got a notification for this now and JUST realized it's a new video. thank you for your sacrifices 🗿
Damn you got the whole eddyverse in the video
I saw this upload when I woke up alone, in bed in the dark and audibly went: "No, nnnoo, you hated the last one!"
#1 on trending
Does the Margaritaville in Conroe not count?😢
cant wait for next year
Now you gotta do all 60 Cracker Barrels
So my dad was a bit of a parrot head. I remember having to listen to his albums as a child. Wooo boy
I went to a margaritaville in Cozumel I think? All I remember is they had snorkeling behind the restaurant to see all the pretty tropical fish and they sold those shirts that make you look like a skinny lady in a bikini
He changed the icon I’m depressed now
all Bubba Gump's is gonna be next year
Just a couple of guys bein dudes
The year is 2045, Eddy is a millionaire and committed to visiting every Hard Rock Cafe across the world
binkley moment
Why didn’t you go to the one on Lake Conroe, in Montgomery, TX (North Houston)? It’s a resort on the water
If you do this again, which is 50/50, I would suggest Bubba Gump’s or Dick’s Last resort.
he's done it again, folks
wow eddy and ted great
My only Margaritaville experience was the one in the Mall of America back in March. I got that Jambalaya just like you.  And it was very not good.
Ok so fun fact next to both Panama City Beach and Destin’s Margaritaville exists a kiddy train (which I shall not name) that i worked at for two summers. The crowds near the Destin Margaritaville were some of the drunkest I have ever experienced, and multiple other train drivers got fired because they ended up hitting drunk people. Absolute wild job, wish I could have seen you but I don’t work there any more, as I got a lower stress job somewhere else.
you just did rainforest cafe?  I mean this in the most caring way, what the fuck is wrong with you dude?  EDIT: Okay so the viewership is blatantly paying these guys to go on vacation  I get it, I would do the same
No Shreveport casino location?
Hey guys.  Im not sure how to tell you this… but there is a Margaritaville casino and resort in Shreveport LA, that you guys totally skipped.  I hope you guys never see this comment.  Wouldn’t that be crazy of you had to do this ALL OVER AGAIN.
Canon: Dan is bi and wants to hook up with Jimmy and the blonde woman
who is this guy
“The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?!” 😂😂 best quote ever
literally just powered off my phone and took a good hot second to cool off after seeing Jschlatt. horrifying truly to see youtubers you genuinely hope are good people whose content you enjoy throughly accept someone like that with open arms as a friend. from the wildly vile racism, to the homophobia and ableism, to the slurs hes said. all it takes is one click to see some of the most sickening hateful things this man has done. and with no remorse either and with these actions being RECENT. heartbreaking to lose some amazing content creators today to choosing to be complicit in racism, homophobia, and ableism.
next is Dave n Busters or Planet Hollywood
My dad owns one of the franchises of those tiki bar boats. They're pretty popular and super fun highly recommend if you're in an area with them. Called Cruisin Tikis!
Send feet pics pls
can’t wait for part 3!
Margaritaville in Florida >>>> anywhere else
You drove through and stayed at so many locations near and dear to my heart! It seems like this south treated you well. We're not all crazy down here! Also, it's a shame you couldn't go to Dollywood. It is one of my favorite places and one of the best theme parks out there. The one thing we can all agree with down here is that Dolly is queen and must be protected at all costs.
next year you should eat at every medieval times.
Having worked food and bev at UO I can tell you, pretty much everything margaritaville serves, there's another venue on CityWalk that serves the same thing better. Also having studied music business and knowing way too much about some of these companies I know way more than I want about the margaritaville brand lol
Jimmy famously lived on sponge cake for a while, so a whole menu should be doable.
Margaritaville universal park: 2:44  Phoenix: 6:37  Day 2: 7:59  Day 3: 10:08  Day 4: 12:38  Day 5: 14:19  Day 6: 17:26  Day 7: 20:05  Day 8: 22:04  Day 9: 27:13  Day 10&11 28:47  Day 12: 32:01  Day 13: 33:09  Day 14: 35:53  Day 15: 40:19  Day 17: 43:53  Day 18&19 46:26  Day 20: 48:47  Day 22: 54:05  Day 23: 54:36  Day 24: 55:08
What about every bubba Gumps?
when i was in key west i tore a muscle in my neck. before i knew that, i sat in margarittaville crying my eyes out staring at jimmy buffet on the wall because of how bad my neck hurt.   good times. the nachoes were good.
Up next: every red robin in America
Holy shit, Navy Pier, that takes me back. I havent been there in YEARS!!
wait, he missed the lake conroe resort and south padre island in texas!
Buffalo Chicken Poutine, because you were in Canada *AND next to Buffalo NY. Good move, good move!
Eddy you have no clue how excited i was to see you came to PCB
Isn’t there a location in palm desert?
I need to see more torture like this
This is the quality content that the world neeeeeeedddddssss god bless you mission good sir  Go forth and be buffet
Don’t be a coward, go on the margaritaville cruise next
What about the Margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach, FL?
@EddyBurback Next year do cracker barrel 😂❤😂❤😂
i didn't think you could top the rainforest cafe video but wow. you and ted are true warriors
RETURN OF THE KING
as soon as he said “atlanta, GA” i went “oh, buddy” 😭 if there’s one thing you can count on in life, it’s that there will ALWAYS be atl traffic. and atl traffic is an entirely different beast
Why did yall skip the one in jacksonville?? Was looking forward to your review :(
Never clicked on a video so fast. We are going to need another road trip of mediocre food haha.
In case you care, it's pronounced Bi-lux-ee not Bi-locks-see. (Biloxi, MS). They made the same mistake in the Hannibal show.
Is actually crazy that stinky feet is almost in every single arcade in Ontario
Omg yes u went back to the Rainforest Cafe!!!
alternate title: eddy burback gets kidnapped by jimmy buffet and develops stockholm syndrome
So glad you got to experience the ever watching eye of the Tim misny ads that haunt us in Cleveland
so should i be the asshole and tell him that there's a new margaritaville at south padre island, texas, on the border of mexico, which technically means he didnt goto all the margaritavilles in America?
Next year you should eat at every McDonald’s
Can't wait for Ted and Eddy to do this with McDonald's next year.
Cant wait for next year when he goes to every Microcenter in the country
Imagine pitching the alien dino what if timeline museum idea in a meeting.  Then everyone was like "Let's spend a bunch of money on this!  Millions!  Let's put it in a gas station!"
Imagine if margaritaville had an All you can eat Jimmy Buffet
so cracker barrel next?
the way he said biloxi was gross
I can't wait for next summer's video when you visit every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Weird seeing the boys go through Granbury because I've been through there many times.
You should do Bubba Gump shrimp next time! Love your videos! 😊
bet you wont due the hard rock cafe
you know these two have a strong friendship if they can survive two 3+ week-long roadtrips together
Do Bubba Gump's next you coward
my family are huge parrotheads, so this was a massively nostalgic video for me. now you need to go to a buffet concert to really seal the deal.
amazing video, i got so excited when i saw this in my feed
You have nobody to blame but yourself
E
fun fact the margaritaville in destiny usa  owes the mall a bunch of money in rent
Now do every McDonald’s in America I think there’s only like 20
Little did Eddy know, next year he is going to every Bubba Gump in the USA.😂
Dick's Last Resort trip next year?
Now go to every McDonald’s on the planet
Perfect, a sequel to one of my all-time favorite YouTube videos. Good on you Eddy
Stop having kids people! It’s immoral to subject your children to unnecessary suffering without their consent! Because no one can consent to being born, it should be assumed that consent to being born doesn’t exist; therefore, no action should be taken on behalf of the child. Just like how it’s not okay to r@pe an unconscious person just because they can’t consent to your act. Everyone has the rights to eternal peace & freedom from all harm, both of which can only result from remaining in the void. Therefore, every human being has the right to NOT be born so long as they cannot provide informed consent to being born. Otherwise, bringing a child into the world without their consent is a violation of their autonomy & cannot be ethically justified!
I need that Yikes tapestry in the opening and I'm mad I was too late to get the crewneck in my size. Time to go sit in a corner and mope. (They're so good. ;w;)
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information. I am not affiliated with this website or ministry, they are simply tools that I think may help you!  https://jackhibbs.com/know-god/  https://jackhibbs.com/real-life-basics/
Cracker barrel next?
Can’t wait until he goes to every Bubba Gump shrimp!
Drinking game idea:  drink a margarita everytime he mentions Jimmy
It’s so funny that you seem so miserable because no one made you do this lmfao
i'm glad u got the true atlanta experience, the worst traffic ever and the nicest people ever
Imagine being from Syracuse
just watching this video made me nauseous
"Grandpa Eddy, what were you doing when you were younger?" "I once spent a month driving around the country drinking margaritas."
Hey; Thanks, eh?
I needed this rlly badly.
Those boats were literally my rafts that I make in totk
Ted got stockholm syndrome at the end of the trip
I'm so sorry Eddie, and I don't know if anyone else mentioned, but it seems you've missed Margaritaville at Sea outta West Palm Beach 😫😢 amazing though your videos keep me goin
This video is a blessing sent straight from heaven above
I'd like to see a video of you going to the worst rated chili's in each state.
Second and “final”… hard rock cafe 2024
the way i live in between destin and panama city beach and would sell my left leg (not my right) to eat with yall
So when do you road trip to every Bubba Gump? 😂
He can’t hide his torture kink anymore. There’s no other excuse.
Just saying, there’s 35 Hard Rock Cafes in Canada and the USA
Eddy is an absolute dreamboat these days and it's incredibly distracting
Hard Rock Cafe next year
BARBENHEIMERVILLE
good use of Vivaldi's Winter, spring and fall are way overused but winter is under appreciated in modern media and arguably the best piece of baroque composition full stop, thanks for the quality as always, Ed-boy
theres a margaritaville in the evans terminal at the detriot airport smh
Watching this video with a tummy ache hits different.  I also can’t wait for the Hard Rock Cafe video next year.
#1 on trending! So happy for you. Love the content, and I'm sure this gets old, but never get rid of that mustache. I strive to have one so thick and glorious.
I always wondered what the thing posters were about. I’ve literally driven past all 50 of those signs on the way down to Tucson
Logical next step is Hard Rock Cafe
hadnt laughed so hard in awhile im sharing this vid everywhere!
Surprised to not see you stay at the Margaritaville casino/hotel in Shreveport, LA but also only just realized this was a restaurant chain lol
Hey Eddy, has anyone told you that you look like this emoji: 🥸
Man I missed you Eddy haha What a JOURNEY to see you slowly get Jimmified, and get PTSD whenever encountering you old nemesis Rainforest Cafe..  (Always a pleasure seeing Danny as well haha)
next year they go to every hard rock cafe
YOU DIDNT GO TO THE MARGARITAVILLE IN PALM SPRINGS MOTHER FUGGER EDIT: THERE WILL BE AN ASTERISK NEXT TO THIS RECORD EDWARD!!
amazing work. you can barely even tell he’s being weekend at bernie’sed
I love these videos please make more but make sure your sane when you do it
as a girl who lived in Key West for 3 years. I applaud your efforts. You are clearly a better person than I cause i never even set foot in that place 😂
I work at the one in conroe
Finished the video, genuinely my new favourite eddy video and am now more inpired than ever to take a weird ass roadtrip
Just a guy and his boyfriend traveling together and enjoying food 😂😂😂
Thank you for sharing what the Thing really is. I’ve lived in Arizona my whole life. I see the ads constantly. I’ve been told vague descriptions by the brave souls who gave in, though never shown any images. But despite the fact that I’ve been to that rest stop, I never could bring myself to spend the $5 it would take to curb my curiosity and actually see it. And now I don’t have to 🤗
Next eat at every Chiles in the World please ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As an Atlanta native, I'm so thankful you had a wonderful experience with Ted 🥰💖
Picking up w**d after work tomorrow so I can truly appreciate this video
I liked that video! And I love Jimmy Buffet! :)
Bubba Gumps next year?
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe, cuz all good jokes come in 3’s
This is a microcosm of America. I love it.
Day 1 of requesting a trip to every Dick’s Last Resort in the country 🙏🏼
the primitive example of the human condition
I could go for some horchata right about now
NPW DO EVERY CRACKER BARREL NEXT.
It's funny, I've only eaten at the one in Vegas and I feel like I have eaten at all of these.
Waiting on the Bubba Gump episode
I actually live near Syracuse and I've gone to Destiny a few times. Never the Margaritaville though. It was weird seeing a niche internet microcelebrity up in Northern New York
Eddy is slowly becoming an alcholic
Eddy when the Boston location finally opens what if you did a viewer meetup there for the grand opening 🥺
35:05 shout out to the Atlanta Margaritaville location, as someone who has worked at a restaurant for a few years, they will often close unpredictably on the more "dead" nights and I personally love that she took time out of her night to just grab you guys some leftovers and heat it up for you guys!  Service employees deserve better, man. ❤
Down here we have Lulu's, which is Jimmy Buffet's sister's restaurant, and it's actually fantastic. Fresh gulf seafood, really great vibes. And you likely drove past it between Biloxi and Destin. I wish you had managed to stop by, it's a million times better than Jimmy's restaurants.
you didn’t go to the Miami airport one 💔
I went to the Niagra falls Margaritaville and it was an absolute fever dream. Our waiter was coked out of his mind and was barely comprehensible by the end of our stay. Got destroyed on their daiquiris. Experienced the tequila waterfall into the blender many times.
Coward
I’ve been to the Syracuse mall location a couple of times and…. That mall is definitely dying out
Do Cracker Barrel.
Now you need to hit every Cracker Barrel in the US
Bubba gump next
You should do Taffers Tavern next from bar rescue
This made me realize how ugly and consumerist the us really is
Bass Pro Shops next haha
my first and probably only time being in pigeon forge someone was out in their balcony at the margarita ville hotel and threw a cigarette at me 🙃🙃
you got to see a cleveland landmark: a misney billboard 🥹
Had to pause, I am a Biloxi MS native and if you ever in your life pronounce it like "Billoxee" I will flip tf out. DOWN HERE IT'S CALLED "Bill-ux-ee"
I'm glad he enjoyed this trip better than the last one, but it was very funny to see the Rainforest Cafe PTSD
YESSSS I WILL WATCH THIS SO MANY TIMES LIKE I DID WITH RAINFOREST CAFE
Just throwing this out there, but there are only ten Medieval Times
almost cried at the end... great show!
5:04 Jarvis looking quite astute, if I do say so myself
I would 100% go to Margaritaville and only order beer
You won’t do Texas Roadhouse
I’m glade you enjoyed New Mexico! It’s kinda the worse but with some pretty cool spots:)
OK, so I’m watching this in the middle of the night. And I’m exhausted. And throughout the whole video, I could understand how they felt. Because I literally feel like that right now! It’s incredible how they actually did that. But throughout the whole video, I was just thinking. Man. I want to be Jimmy Buffett.. Buffett.. Buffett.. (fading out) Buffett….
these men are insane. are they gonna just keep doing this? going to gimmicky chain restaurants? what's next, bubba gump shrimp co. from the famous forrest gump movie starring tom hanks?
Chrissy can proudly say "My boyfriend went to every Rainforest and Margaritaville restaurant and barely survived ✊"
23:00 did you just diss taco stands????????????????????
So I happen to live within short distance of Pigeon Forge.  I have heard about Dollywood literally my entire life.  I have been there 4 different times and each more disappointing than the last.  It's never worth it.  I would actively convince people NOT to go but there's people with LIFETIME PASSES that go every month.
Do Hard Rock Cafe!!!
Ok now do the hard rock cafe
What about the one in Palm Spring?
the atlanta experience was so real
There’s a Margaritaville in Osage Beach, MO too
Isn't there a Margaritaville resort in Conroe, Texas?
It’s amazing you didn’t become swingers by the end of this.
Love these videos! You should do Bubba Gump next! 🫶🏼
I hope you realize that I now want this to be an annual venture 🫡
Whenever I hear City Walk I think of City Wok from South Park lol
Bet you 20 bucks you won't go to every McDonald's in the US.
Had to comment for the drip.  8/10
Please do a video of eating the whole Cheesecake Factory menue over a few weeks
If I had a nickle for every time Eddy and Ted have driven across the country to eat at every location of a themed chain restaurant, I'd have two nickels - which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
I love the back half of this video  where Eddie gets deranged. Thank you for your sacrifice! 😂
only one of them can enjoy the road trip at a time
The YouTube gods really blessed us today
Bubbagump Shrimp is next
i feel like i accomplished something watching this
#1 Trending!
So much shade to Spencer’s
Jimmy Buffet’s Beach House On the Moon is unironically my favorite album of all time so thank you for this, sir.
you should go to every red lobster next
As an Australian and someone who likes watching these insane videos I say do the horror that is the outback steakhouse and live the Aussie experience as dictated by America!!!!
Truly the best video yet... I clapped at the end screen... GREAT job eddie.. This has everything a movie has. Sorry..I mean this video itself IS a movie..
This makes me so happy
Man says he doesn't have a depression, then goes to every Margaritaville in US and Canada. Mad respect.
You have to eat at EVERY Hard Rock Cafe next.
There’s a margaritaville in destin Florida I’ve eaten at before on vacation. And I can’t wait for the next time i go to be able to say wow eddy has been here. It’s going to be so magical.
Thing museum is right down the street from my house been Going since i was a kid
Did they do the one in pensacola?
Oh damn I know exactly where the San Antonio margaritaville is,, it’s right across from the event center I used to go to anime conventions at dhdgdghdfg big hearts to the San Antonio river walk + Fuck I’ve been to that bucees too i hate being from Texas
Hard Rock Cafe next year
Where do we send the money for seeing his feet?
#1 on trending  babyyy
I liked the part when they went to Margaritaville
Bumba Gump next year
Oh no, Eddy, honey, not again! 🤣 Have some dandelion tea, it'll help settle your stomach. And thanks for settling the question of who was really behind 9/11.
Why?
You should've gone to does eat place instead when you were at the hotel honestly. We had one where I live and it was hands down the biggest, best(most expensive) steak in town. They left
This was NUMBER ONE on trending on Thursday July 20th 2023.
Comment about the gaming machines at the magaritaville in tulsa thise arent margaritaville themed machines like lucky ducky is just a normal machine that is really common here in OK
I was at work today and I had a feeling that eddy had uploaded a video, and low and behold I open the YouTube app to see this beauty. My eddy senses were right
Medieval Times, Bubba Gump, or Hard Rock Cafe next!!!
It's incredible Eddy accomplished this feat but I would be lying if I said margaritaville wasn't my own personal Hell
Pumped for Bubba Gumps next year
I don’t know about anyone else here, but you should end the trilogy doing a Bubba Gump Shrimp tour.
That’s pretty cool that you saw that guy again. The odds of that happening must be astronomically small. Looks like you’ll have to meet him again if you do another trip next year.
Wait…did the one in Hawaii close?
Oh!! Have you been to the newest Margaritaville in South Padre Island one yet? If not, my sis' and her husband might visit down here in Brownsville next weekend and usually she invites me to go! It would be awesome to get your autograph!
I have to laugh because I'm pretty sure they're building a Margaritaville in Ft. Myers Beach and Hurricane Ian fucked it over. You could've been in my back yard but alas, beach be gone xjsjsjzjs
Hearing the last mango in Paris margarita was good brings me satisfaction, as it should
Hard Rock Cafe next!!!
If I had a nickel for everytime Eddy made himself insane by willingly crossing an entire country just to eat at dying chain restaurants I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s funny that it happened twice
Ya real cool. Now do Chili's
I don't know if you can handle another year of this. But please go to every Bubba Gumps locations. It's literally across from both the rainforest cafe and margaritaville at the mall of America😂
Eddy I only clicked on the video because ami watched teds
So… Bubba Gump next year?
I'm only 30mins into this but I can say without a doubt I have no reason to leave my room ever again when I can just live vicariously through your videos.
i will pay 5 dolla if you go to every waffle house
Now do Dave and busters let's go three for three
Every time I go to a Margaritaville themed thing it's empty. How are they not bankrupt? It all looks like a big investment that's barely breaking even.
I think Bubba Gumps should be next
eddy… how much for the feet pics?
The video is a lie. The Original Margaritaville is in Sandusky, Ohio.
Just like eddy I too was terrified of dr.suess but not the ride but the live action movie w Mike myers . Terrified me as a kid and the ride is creepy too
i never thought i would watch  two,  hour long videos about going to the same restaurant multiple towns, thank you eddie for your wonderful commentary and taking us along your pointless adventure.
This video is literally what reading American Psycho was like
wtf is wrong with you dawg
32:11 they’re actually so cute though
please go on the margaritaville cruise
this is your fitzcarraldo
Mr. Money bags and Lucky Duck are pretty much casino mascots in Oklahoma.
46:32 a welcome surprise to see Tim Misny here, lol
12:47
Bubba Gump shrimp co next?
#1 on trending
Hard Rock Cafe when?
Is 52:50 supposed to be a Blade Runner reference lmao
i sense cheesecake factories should be the next road trip
He doesn't know-
eating at the chain stores but not staying at all the resorts kinda feels like cheating.
Lol all the people recommendeding McDonald's or waffle houses are seriously underestimating how many locations that would be. I think McDonald's owns like the third most property in the world, with like the number one slot going to the catholic church. Waffle house isnt that big but like at least 1500 locations in the south easy.
Didn’t know I needed this video lol, your gonna have to keep doing food videos because they are so entertaining 😂
Where is the Shreveport, LA margaritaville ?! 😭😭😭😭
And a dozen Binkley's wept this day
Oh Eddy... Not again.
I can't believe you did this again. I am sooo in. Edit: After watching, this is one of my favorite videos ever. Incredible work
Go to every McDonald’s in the USA
You know Eddy i think you should try the rain forecast cafe just one more time and you'll really see the magic
Thank you for doing this again. Nobody asked you to, but we appreciate the result. I still think about the rainforest cafe vid and shudder
the fact that you had you had to come to tulsa at all is tragic. fun fact Riverspirit is where i got my Cherokee card.
I love these videos! Keep doing them once a year if you don’t die :)  Edit: I actually liked the jambalaya in AC 😅
I was so hoping someone with a mustache would document all the hard rock cafes in the US and Canada
Next year you’re doing Hard Rock Cafe?
Wastin away again. Beautiful stuff
why?
Hey man at least it’s not another Rainforest Cafe like place. So it’s much more merciful than the other.
So, next year are you going to all Bubba Gump Shrimp locations in the US and Canada?
it was with this video that I learned that the Compass by Margaritaville hotel in my town with a 5 O'Clock somewhere bar and restaurant DOES NOT count as a Margaritaville 😭
god not schlatt please
#1 ON TRENDING!!!!!!!
bro literally drove right by my work im devastated
Your next one should be Midevil Times, theres only 10 of them
Aww Buddy is your standard New Mexican Gas Station doggo.
It took me watching both these videos to realise when they said bowl of chips they meant crisps so they were asking for a bowl of crisps not a small serving of chips (fries)
absolutely obsessed with the use of winter from Vivaldi's the four seasons in this video
Finally, a video for me!
I just watched teds vid im not watching both
This is the sequel we needed... outback steakhouse should be the finale
It’s the way my family sat and watched this video anticipating the Cleveland location as it’s my mom’s favorite just for it to be the shortest segment 💔. It’s okay we still loved the video though.
Eddy I want nothing more than to do one of these trips. I feel as if I am living my dream through you and for that I thank you sir
schlatt jumpscare
beautiful
Hard Rock Cafe next year
I know what an absolute psycho I am that I would do this and eat like 2 dishes the entire time and enjoy it. I eat at the same Restaurant all the time and order the same thing.
I'm curious to see what road trip y'all take next year!
So…Hard Rock Cafe is next year, right?
Was that guy in bucees wearing the same shirt as in the picture too?
the myrtle beach food is exactly like myrtle itself: wet, basic, and unsettling
Eddy you absolutely obliterated that kid at "stinky stinky feet", not even a competition. What a loser at "stinky stinky feet" this kid what, sloppy strategy and weak execution. I'm so glad how you destroyed this little know-it-all at "stinky stinky feet"
Please stop doing these.
West
as someone who lives in Syracuse, the segment being basically 30 seconds as a sidebar is so representative 💀
man i can’t wait to immediately watch ted’s pov of this adventure
Glad you got to see a Tim misny billboard in Cleveland
i can’t believe i was 45 minutes away from eddy and more importantly a margaritaville and i never even knew. (also probably because im not over 21)
50:20 this is the exact image of what eddy sees in his nightmares post ‘road trip’ series
the hell is a margaritaville
Ted went through Stockholm syndrome with Margaritaville, with how he started to.. just enjoy it oddly?
The Rashomon sensation of watching both Ted's and Eddy's videos about the same trip is my favourite. The storytelling here again is remarkable.
i’m from FL, that rain SUCKS. i forgot how awful it was when i moved to Phoenix for a while. readjusting to those downpours when i moved back was the Worst.
you didn't waste your time. 843,000 people watched this video. you wasted their time too :) (this is a joke, i really enjoyed the video, please take next year off for your health)
I clicked on this video and said “ahh yes good content”
can't wait for next years trip!
As someone who lives a few hours from Dollywood I NEED you to do a video on it lol they do a ton of decorating for fall and Christmas!
Honestly so glad you decided to do another trip , your last video i watched while on the tv was locked away in the mind vault and so glad it was unlocked !  keep up the good work I can wait a year for another one because that shit looks so exhausting and lowkey expensive to do . Can't wait to see how every margaraitaville goes for ya
I am absolutely heartbroken to break this to you, but you in fact did not go to every margaritaville in the USA and Canada. The margaritaville at sea is a margaritaville cruise ship that leaves from Florida
YEAH HE CALLED THE PISTACHIO BEAUTIFUL GO NEW MEXICO!
ANNNNDDDDD now do hard rock cafe
Next year you need to do this but with McDonald's
What about Jacksonville beach ):
Mellow, not smooth, kinda shitty... Jimmy Buffet.
Bet you wont do all of the hard rock cafes in the whole world
#1 on trending dude!!!! So exciting!!
Do every hard rock cafe next year lol
...so, same time next year?
What about Jacksonville beach ):
Misny makes them pay.
How are you gonna say you ate at every margaritaville in the country when you didn’t even eat at the one in boulder Colorado?
Was your girlfriend using a fork and knife to eat a shrimp kabob?
The way I had to put my phone down after I saw this title in my feed. Surely he couldn’t do this again. 🤞
Now do it with every McDonald’s
Next do chilis
The soundtrack on this one BANGED dude.
i'm really sorry u guys didn't get to enjoy broadway at the beach in myrtle beach, that specific margaritaville is a core childhood memory of mine and i bet y'all would have enjoyed the shopping and attractions (especially the simpsons stuff!) i hope u can come back to MB one day it's a blast
Eddy commenting a third time cause I want you to get more money and this video was so awesome
Why
As a rock climber, I would be terrified if the wall I was climbing started smoking lmao
Looks like Ted, a well known psychic vampire, was running low on psychic energy and decided to manipulate Eddy into offering himself as a meal source.
Next year lets do the HARD ROCK CAFE, THERES 34 :D
I can only hope for another video like this. I love this style
Around 26 minutes in you can see his toes for about half a second WITHOUT PAYING AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
do bubba gump next
Eddy got pinworms on this trip from the fish and chips for our entertainment
Damn, that’s really messed up what the aliens did
texas roadhouse next!?
Yikes Eddie's pronunciation of "Biloxi" was absolutely horrendous 🤮
Greatest musician that lives
Canadian here, the reason the poutine was the bes is because poutine fucks hard
Eddy you tease. at least give me a paid option to see your feet.
I saw this video come up on my feed and unbidden, in the most dismayed voice, I just said "Eddy, Eddy, what are you DOING, Eddy?" Anyway I know what I'm doing for the next fifty-eight minutes!
47:07 best moment
so... hard rock next?
being a mbmbam fan really gives this video another layer
Eddy's whole trip: My tummy hurts and I'm not being brave about it
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Next, king?
Bubba Gump for next year's road trip?
Fun Fact: There is another restaurant in Myrtle Beach called “Lulu’s” which is owned by Jimmy Buffets sister, Lucy.
I’m calling it next year is “I went to every Bubba Gumps in America (and Canada)”
Do every TGI Fridays next.
The Syracuse one, yeah more than a couple people have been shot there. Glad you survived. No I'm not kidding. That mall is riddled with shootings Syracuse NY is sketchy as fuck
as someone who deals with atlanta traffic literally everyday f or work, eddy being forced through the hell that is rush hour brings a smile to my face
Margaritaville Lake Resort Lake of the Ozarks?
Oh my god, I work at Nickelodeon Universe at the Mall of America, and I saw you guys coming off the Pepsi Orange Streak coaster from my control panel at the Crazy Cars bumper cars, and I had been second guessing myself ever since then if it was really you. I feel so vindicated that I was correct it was you, but sad that I wasn't able to say hi due to being on the clock.   Either way, big fan of you and Ted's work, hopefully i'll be able to catch you next time you're at the MOA for another questionable road trip. :)
Hard Rock Cafe next? XD
Missed the one in Palm Springs.
Hard rock cafe next
3:00
29:00 minutes in when talking to drew, weird object in sky lol
are you having a view competition with Ted? You def should xF
looks like old man burback is running out of ideas. Sad!
Hard Rock Cafe better be on the look out
Watching this drunk and high as Fuck is like a fever dream
46:32 MINSEY MAKES THEM PAY JUMPSCARE
you didnt have to blur the feet ;)
Eddy you have done so much with Ted on his whim, if he didn’t owe you before, he does now. You deserve it.
Why are there bone of these resturants in Washington state? I just noticed this lol
BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP FACTORY NEXT!!!!
can we appreciate how at 28:15 eddy and gracie PERFECTLY harmonized??
Again? Eddie you good bro?
Now you have to do all 34 Hard Rock Cafes
It is a right of passage to stop at The Thing on any road trip through southern arizona.
A masterpiece once again
Like for every Cheesecake Factory in the country !
Did the Margaritaville at the Lake of the Ozarks, MO not count?
eddy come on now you have to go to every hard rock cafe
Didn’t go to the casino in Bossier. Very disappointed…
Greatest sequel ever!!!!
Your going to end up developing diabetes from all the sugary alcoholic drinks and fried food lol
you guys should do Dicks last resort or Bubba Gumps next summer HAHAHAH
Dear god
Looking forward to next year when you hit all the Bubba Gumps!
wait till this guy hears about jungle Jims
I have no idea who you are or where came from but based upon the roller coaster of emotion that was your intro. I will now consume your content as a "subscriber".
Am I the only one who looks at those markers on the map and sees Samus' helmet?
Football sized , basketball sized hole.
I opened the Margaritaville at City-walk in Los Angeles and I worked at the one in Orlando…… and I honestly don’t know how you did this entire  trip without wanting to blow your brains out. I remember someone asking me if I was brainwashed from working there because it was so culty 😩  edit: ALSO, Jimmy is a dick. We were threatened to be fired if we tried to say hello to him during the California opening, and he ignored all of us 😑
I had no idea this restaurant even existed. lol
Do every McDonald’s in the country.
Shoutout to the dude you met twice, both times on the worst trips of your life
My grandfather lived in Key West and my mom and I would go to the Margaritaville there when we would visit him, so a part of me feels very nostalogic seeing them visit that location 🥹
Hard Rock Cafe Planet Hollywood  I never want this series to end
10/10 writing, perfect character arcs, amazing suspense / payoffs, and most importantly plenty of jimmy buffet
"I did two tours"  Where? "Rainforest Café and Margheritaville"
Shlat jump scar
How are we back at this?
Hard Rock Cafe
what about the margarita ville cruise line
Can someone explain to me why someone would choose to rent a truck for a road trip? Nothing you're doing on the trip is made easier by having one.
In 2011 i threw up on the margarita machine under the Hurricane in Myrtle Beach SC Margaritaville because I either ate too many pickles or got immediate food poisoning from the meal.
Our boy truly wasted away in Margaritaville
See you guys next year when Eddy and Ted go to every Hard Rock Cafe in America and Canada!
why did they rent one of the least fuel efficient options, when it would probably save them so much money on the rental and gas to rent a regular car with luggage space for two people :(
I want your sofa.
the thing bit was so true, i feel like we’ve all stopped there at least once lol
can't wait to see what restaurants you hit a year from now to conclude the trilogy ;)
Now do Subways
edward no
{Jumps through the entire video hoping to see the Margaritaville in my workplace that’s been open for a couple years now and doesn’t actually see it}  I guess airport Margaritaville’s don’t count. This entire video is a lie.
I don't know why, but I love that there's one shared meme throughout all the internet and content creators. You don't show your feet for free.
Hey just FYI there are 23 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co's in amercia seems like the perfect number for a road trip
You guys made me home sick for the Pigeon Forge Area! I even rode the exact same Ferris wheel!
My mom was really into Jimmy Buffet when I was a child so for the rest of my life I have to tell people my first ever concert was fucking Jimmy Buffet at age 5 🥲
I’m so excited for the inevitable Bubba Gump Shrimp tour where you end up again at Mall of America within 100 feet of both the Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville.
Omg twinsies I also went to the The Thing thing
I genuinely want to know what Jimmy Buffett thinks about this. Do bubba gumps next!
Your next video should be you eating every applebee's that would be really funny. haha
Ill be back for next years video guys where he goes to every subscribers house for a meal.
never comment on youtube but your content rules Eddie, i want more but ill be patient🫡
I was just in Niagara falls a month ago on a small holiday with my wife. Jimmy was staring at me from my hotel room at the Fallsview Hilton. I walked past many times on my way to the falls and tired to understand why I would want to eat there.  My wife and I went to the Rainforest Cafe when we were there thanks to your last video. I think I would have rather went to Margaritaville! Now I feel like I failed at life after watching this video.
I've only been to the Cleveland Margaritaville, but i still think about their fried pickles
I accidentally had a bunch of plastic neon yellow hats from a party in my car when my friends and I stopped at buccees on the way to the beach… it’s been the only time we haven’t lost anyone in there😂😂
i love me a good jakey and jarvis cameo OMFG JORDAN
Eddy burback psh more like eddy piggyback, the only reason this guy gets any views is because of his YouTube friends, piggybacking off other people’s names, the only reason people know of this guy is because of other people promoting him
you look like a muppet
So, next year you’re doing every Hard Rock Cafe or Bubba Gumps, right?
NOT THE EYEBROW BILLBOARD IN CLEVELAND 💀
There are 34 hard rock cafes in the US + Canada. You know what to do.
all i’m saying is that dick’s last resort exists
Literally was just at the PCB location right across the street at a restaurant few days ago. Wild.
As an Atlanta native, it's classic that Eddy got stuck in traffic
Ummm, there is Margaritaville in Flowery Branch, GA he didn’t go to. So, he missed one.
i vote for Hard Rock Cafe next year
Ah yes, the Harry Turtledove museum.
Margaritaville is real?
The national pride I felt watching  you guys enjoy the Canadian Margaritaville has seldom been seen on this planet
Damn Eddy....  what do we call this? Masochistaville? Margheritavillan?... next stop every McDonald's in yhe U.S and Canada!
okay but for a real challenge try eating at every McDonalds in the country
Where are they going to go next year?
Stuck in Atlanta traffic. You have lived my life.
Can't believe you came to Oklahoma!! Casinos are big here HAHA
So, you guys doing Bubba Gump next year?
11:36 I literally said EXACTLY THIS and then Eddy repeated me a second later. A truly magical experience.
wasn’t expecting a sequel. i love it but at the same time for your sanity can we not make this a thing?
eddy, why
well not every single one. There’s one at Detroit metro airport but it’s a small one and kinda of an off brand but it’s still there 🤷‍♂️
Now do every fudruckers
IM SO EXCITED
Parrotheads (Jimmy Buffet Crazy Fans) are a whole level of crazy. Also Jimmy Buffet was my first post COVID concert.
Yes! Somebody finally talking about the ansolute mess the cat and the hat ride is! Its is so freaky for a beloved "childrens" story. I feel like for all the money universal is making they really need to use some to clean up the Dr. Seuss area, or dont, I mean that guy was a Nazi sympathizer, right? But its kind of an eye sore
Tf is a margaritaville
Now do this with every mcdonals
I'm having Dream Daddy flashbacks, freakin Joseph and his Jimmy Buffet obsession, plus the word "cult" in there thrown in to seal the deal XD
Next year, y'all going to every Bubba Gumps in the country? 😂
,,,Applebee’s next?? /j
Now do every McDonald’s 🧍‍♀️
The sequel I never expected to get
Fun Buffett fact for you he was born in Pascagoula Mississippi
I need to know if Eddy knows about the Margaritaville Resort in Missouri
My buddy met a girl at the pigeon forge margaritaville and they dated for 3 years and she took out a bunch of credit cards in his name ans destroyed his credit lmao true story
new york city jambalaya? how good can it be?
As an Oklahoman who lives about 5 minutes away from that casino, I’m glad we had the pleasure of giving you a 10 hour detour to our underwhelming state
Love a good Mississippi shout out
No one made you do this twice… BUUUUUUUUTTTTTTT what if you went to every Hard Rock Cafe
Next one should be all hard rock cafes, there's only 33
Omg do Texas Roadhouse y’all please 🙏
Literally turned to my gf and made a joke that you were gonna get stuck in atlanta traffic and lo and behold lol
Love that you got to see one of the Misny billboards. You know what he does? He makes them pay
hard rock cafe next year?
Suddenly realizing Eddy came to my hometown and ate and I didn’t even know…
how many times did yall drive drunk lolllll
It would definitely kill the both of you, but it’d be a good capper to these vids if you and Ted tried to eat at every Waffle House in the nation next!
…isn’t there a margaritaville in missouri
Back at it again? But I’m sure you got some good grub to  backstab your friends just in case.
The video you didn't know you were waiting for.
now do mcdonalds :3
The level of commitment: unmatched
Hard Rock Cafe
It has rained just about every day for the last month and half here in South Florida
Trilogy! Trilogy! Trilogy!
I went to the Margaritaville at Niagara Falls!! Had a great time.
Eddy Ted's truck broke down in the town I went to undergrad in last year and you go to a Margaritaville in the city where I went to law school, Syracuse, in a mall I frequented a lot and walked passed, but never ate at, almost weekly during law school
second and final??? No, we need more! 😃😃
Just starting the video, I'm really hoping you ate a lot of coconut shrimp
This feels like i should be able to log this on my letterboxd
Can’t wait for McDonalds 2024
This happening again was such a surprise! I wonder where they go next😂
Very upset you skipped the Margaritaville in Conroe Eddy. Jimmy would be too
https://youtu.be/qdU74e4RAG4
Y'all, right across from the Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville in Mall of America (quite literally, entrance facing RFC & MV) is a Bubba Gumps, a themed chain restaurant with 22 locations in the United States.  Mark your calendars everybody; Part 3 coming summer 2024!!!
Lack of "live music" is a plus at a restaurant. It's loud, shitty (good bands aren't playing in restaurants), and you can't hear each other.
they’re supposedly building a Margaritaville in Mount Pocono (Pennsylvania) sometime next year, so i’m expecting an update video someday
Eddy sacrificing his sanity for the second time for our entertainment...what a nice guy!
BUC-EES GANG
every mcdonalds please
Can't wait for next year's edition
19:29 uncensored version????
Next up: Bubba Gumps 😛
I went to the Hollywood margaritavill because it was for my gf prom and uh after a whole day of flying back to Florida from El Salvador and I was too tired to notice the excellence that was Jimmy
Please do Hard Rock Cafe next 🎉
Put some respect on that manatee, his name is Lou and he's an EPCOT legend
Now do every McDonald's
I just realized I’ve eaten at the Destin Margaritaville but was too young to know it was a Margaritaville. Very epic
You have no idea how trippy it is to recognize some of the roads in this video. Like the oasis they drive by after leaving his Mom’s place is right near my exit on that highway.
Hard Rock Cafe next year calling it
@4:16 ...and you're the only bait in town
Now do the Hard Rock Cafe lol
Damn that first one must've paid good, cause this is a choice only a complete idiot could choose. That shit barely counts as a restaurant in most countries.
This is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I've ever seen
You forgot about the one in Shreveport, Louisiana
Eddy, clearly your problem was hitting the Jimmy vibe too early. Ted managed to wait until after the actually nice and beachy ones to truly accept the Jimmy lifestyle.
AYYEE U CAME TO CANADA?
this was beautiful
46:32 YYEEEEEAHHHH OHIO BABY!!!! CLEVELAND!!!! GLAD YOU SAW GOOD OLD MINSY!!!!!! (you know what he does)
Eddy your style is so dope! Dug all the fits in the vid! Can’t believe you did this all over again though 😅
Thank you for pointing out that no one should ever go into Spencer’s
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe
Seconf and final time (I cried there)
did you come to south padre island  lol
Setting an alarm for next year's "I ate at every hard rock cafe in the country"
Can you eat at every Mc Donald's in the United States (and Canada) next year? haha
This was amazing! But why did you skip over Margaritaville Lake resort in the Ozark’s?
Never saw how long it was. Just clicked on it knowing it was gonna be a banger. Was surprised to see it was an our long.
Been waiting for another vid like this THANK U
Final Boss is Hard Rock Cafe. 34 in the US.
buhlocksy 😔
But what about the Margaritaville in the Ft. Lauderdale airport?!
Most hard to believe Ted would be willing to do this with you again. And I fully expected Jimmy Buffet himself to rise out of that volcano.
Eddy I watch your videos to relax and get away from things why are you making ads for my employer. (that 4.4% is insane though)
IM SO UPSET. I wish I knew when he was in town so I could have bumped into him! I live right near Destin Florida and have been to the margaritaville down here like 6 times lol. Missed opportunity 🥲
It's probably for the best that you didn't take teds Tacoma on account of it having a hole in the floor
I hate to break it to you. But you missed the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.
Wait, but he missed a margaritaville, there in one on lake conroe in texas. It a whole resort and bar and grill 😂
Cant wait to see what horrible chain restaurant Eddy will choose next year!
Okay but do the Margaritaville cruise now 👀
noooooo you're never supposed to reveal what the thing is now you're gonna be banned from AZ.
You could complete the trilogy and eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
Is there not one in Shreveport La anymore? I went to that one like 3 years ago.
Hard Rock next and I’m buyin that yikes merch.
Eddy Burback #1 on trending..
YESSSSSSS I’m so excited!! Please tell me Ted is in this too! 🥹
dude i was so excited for you to get to biloxi but then you mispronounced it lmao
There's a cruise ship, I'm surprised they did the hotels
So, bubba gumps next?
Eddy, go to all the Hardrock Cafes and make it a trifecta :)
Great sequel…. Do it again
hard rock cafe next
You know, I'd ask if you're also gonna do a road trip to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada (bonus points for spending nights at Hard Rock Hotel locations), but I'm pretty sure the George Bush Intercontinental Airport location is past security.
I remember the Margaritaville in Cleveland. It was a Friday night, and I was trying to wrangle a group of completely wasted family members out of a bar. I looked up, and saw the Margaritaville logo. It took a lot of convincing to prevent them from storming the place for more margaritas.
Can't wait for part 3.
The only Margaritaville I've been to is the Syracuse location. And yeah, it is the pits. At least Eddy didn't get robbed or shot visiting. (That mall has had tons of issues in the past few years).
Now you should do every McDonald’s in America
the mad lad is at it again
ted is great but he looks too much like my old boss so I don't like him
19:40 Eddy drives near a dead body and says nothing
Eddy you need to visit all the specialty Chick-fil-As! They even have a Hawaiian one!
The server in the back at 56:46 was our server the last time we were in Vegas and she was absolutely fantastic; so fun and helpful that she made our day! I was curious if I would spot her in the video at all, and thankfully I did!
return of the FUCKING king
As someone from Syracuse the last place you’ll catch me is at margaritaville but I might have to go after this
Can confirm, did lose my husband in a Buc-ee’s in Georgia
As Jimmy would say, "Goddammit, Eddie, you've done it again!"
His trauma flashbacks every time he encountered a Rainforest Cafe 😂
Jimmy Buffet’s sister, Lucy, has a restaurant too!  It’s called Lulu’s, you have to go eat there now :)
WHY?
You know, I myself only look like a corn star with a mustache, but you sir, absolutely pull it off 💯
But…you missed the one in Puerto Rico
Wow that’s insane the same fan ran into you wtf
Does Ted keep forcing you to do this at gunpoint?
so mad you didnt pull up to my house when you came to syracuse 😤😤
I took a trip to the states literally just last week and dragged my wife to a rainforest cafe because of the last trip. I'm happy to say I have already been to a Margaritaville on a previous holiday, so she's safe... Until next year
“I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe” coming in 2024
Eddy you missed the Margaritaville in Jacksonville FL
This is Shreveport, LA margaritaville erasure. Massive effort and love the video!
I'm so glad america isn't a real place
Did you skip the Margaritaville in Bossier City, Louisiana?   Didn’t see it marked on your map, skimmed through the video and didn’t see you go there….and if you didn’t go there, this video is a lie!
Hey Eddy new video idea for you and Ted, visiting every Walmart in America❤
Shout out to WI dells, that place rocks
Rip the old Tacoma
You and Ted are the goats, I hope this gets 50 million views, I loved Ted's video, watching yours right after.
“City wok, take your order prease”
Please do buckys next
you keep saying "final trip"..... eddy this is not your final trip and you know it
You saw a Ted Minsy billboard.  You really got the Cleveland experience
Rent was due
So glad I'm not the only one who found the Cat In The Hat ride.... unsettling
Why Eddie... Why 😅
32:02 those are some sick moves!
Eddy being part time alcoholic for content is the nicest thing anyone every did for me.
waisting away again at margaritaville.
Eddie did this twice?!? You suffered for our sins good sir
Next one should be going to every McDonald's in america
World wide Hard Rock Cafe is next
I’m watching, liking and commenting out of sheer pity, guilt and a moral imperative to reward you for doing this. How dare you but also thank you.
Welp, I'll look forward to the inevitable revisit when that Margaritaville resort at Ft. Myers Beach opens years from now.
Eddie seems like the guy who has to gather everything and finish every quest in world of warcraft
Eddy needed the animals in the restroom the first time this time it was Jimmy himself, we all need support sometimes . love the content!
Now you've gotta do the Margaritaville cruise
Canada comes through again!
You missed Margaritaville at sea
I worked at the box office in the orange beach amphitheater and I stg all of Jimmy's fans looked and acted like they were on crack or snorted something gnarly and insisted that they knew him and he had tickets held for them 😮‍💨😒 working jimmy Buffett concerts are a fever dream.  Also, there is a small margarita ville on Pensacola beach! Guess you gotta come back to really finish it off 👀
Next up has gotta be bubba Gump shrimp company
I wonder where they actually ate dinner in Las Vegas
Jimmy who? Never heard of him 🤔
As somebody who goes to Mall of America on a semi-regular basis, I was *SO* looking forward to Eddy realizing that Margaritaville is right by Rainforest Cafe. Did not disappoint.
As someone who has gone to school in Atlanta for the past 4 years, and runs around the city almost daily, I had no clue we had a Margaritaville 😂
Next up, all 22 Bubba Gump locations!
So, ya'll are doing Waffle House next year right?
You guys should go to all the Dick's last resort for your 3rd annual trip
Finally cinema is back
He’s gotta do this again next year
I'm watching a guy take a vacation.
You missed the one in the San Juan airport. You have to do it over again.
He missed one
This is how eddy became an alcoholic 👁️👄👁️
I can’t wait until you guys go to all the Bubba Gump’s next year :)))
if you happen to do this again please invest in some charcoal pills. or even pepto.
I loved the split second shot of the Cleveland billboard for local lawyer Tim Misny
Do this again but with dicks last resort, this will genuinely drive him insane guaranteed
You should do mandarin next
Eddy, I BEGGGG, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO TO EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE. I WILL BE ABLE TO DIE HAPPY IF YOU DO.
@eddyburback you missed Shreveport, La! We have a margaritaville here too😢
now do it with Bubba Gump Shramps
Bloody madlads
You guys should have done the Margaritaville Cruise! 3 to 5 days of nonstop Jimmy.
On his actual plane in FL you can also see all the bullet holes from when Jimmy was shot at at the air! You used to be able to touch it too ✈️
so painful knowing you were around here AGAIN and I missed ya. Would love a wild Eddy Burback sighting at a wacky restaurant.
Now do every single Waffle house in Atlanta, that's like 40 locations
next time ya gotta stay at the margaritaville hotel in Medford where I live
Bubba Gumps next?
At this rate, he's gonna do every restaurant in North America next
For future trips  When your stomachs in doubt… invest in antacids? 🫡 🤷
@EddyBurback Please Lookup Margaritaville Puerto Rico... 🇵🇷 🇺🇸
Now do chilis 😂
Do every McDonald's in North America you fucking cowards
Theres a margaritaville resort in Missouri 🥺
As a Parrot Head I'm proud of you guys!
God, the Mall of America is so bland compared to how I remember it as a child. It looks completely dead in his shots.
proud of syracuse for having the worst margaritaville, we don't do a lot out here but we make sure to do it poorly
I was suprised that there was a Margaritaville in new york as ive lived here my whole life and never heard of it but then you showed the statue of liberty and i actually had been there back when i got therapy in times square and occasionally had to eat food in times square when therapy ran late
I'm waiting for the every McDonald's video
MISNEY!
Do Cheesecake Factory next
I think its 35 Hard Rocks and 22 Bubba Gumps.. pick your poison boys
Having been to the Biloxi Margaritaville Resort, I'm happy Eddie had the exact same reaction to how massive that place is. I have also sat in that exact seat next to the burping volcano as children rock climbed to the top, it was truly magnificent.
Am i trippin or did you miss one in jacksonville?
The Thing In The Desert is some of the most fun I’ve had at a random stop on a road trip ever. I still have my alien riding a velociraptor shirt.
Unless I skipped that part… Not to be that guy but you missed the one, right next to pidgon forge there’s another margaritaville in Gatlinburg.
Eddy, it’s time for someone to do a Buckees episode. Every single Buckees  You are the man for the job
Now you guys need to go to every Bubba Gump shrimp in the country. Especially several of them exist at the exact same locations as some of the rainforest cafes and margartiavilles
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CRUISE
cant wait for next years Medieval Times saga 🤩
this is... #1 on trending right now? i mean i'm glad dude, this video is crazy, as was the rainforest cafe vid, but also what
ROUND 3 LETS GO
I just started this video but I hope to see margaritaville crocks
eddy using vivaldi as his “intense” music means so much to me
You didn't go to every Margaritaville in the US, you missed one in Conroe, TX...Jimmy is disappointed in you
Listen, Minnesota just has a good vibe. Too bad you couldn’t experience it
I live in tulsa and my God I had forgotten we have margaritaville 😂
Every MacDonalds next year?
im sorry to say, you missed a Margaritaville location in the BWI airport :(
The Margaritaville DougDoug Challenge
Bubba Gump next
Ok but what about the ones in other locations like the Caribbean?
The only one i’ve ever been to is myrtle beach so i was confused why you hadn’t mentioned the hurricane lol
This is the most perfectly timed video i have ever seen. I was begging my family to go to a margaritaville while on vacation i can now live vicariously through you.
love the slow descent into madness in the mall of america. reminds me of the simpsons ‘shining’ parody
I went to the one in city walk. They had a live band who was taking requests in a fishbowl on stage. But they only played requested jimmy buffet songs.
I stg the Mall of America m&ms sequemce was in reference to an obscure meme about Blade Runner and Tucker Carlson
Awesome. Now do every McDonalds in the world
does the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks, MO not count?
Jarvis Johnson was in the first margaritaville ohhgg!!!
Eddy and Ted creating the most bizzard challenges ever for two restaurant chains that I would want to try, even if it would make me lose my mind and make my stomach have so many issues after two days.
Son of a bitch. He did it again.
Jambalaya shouldn’t be soupy or liquid at all omg
There's always Bubba Gump Shrimp if you change your mind about next year 😊
52:53 this is some bladerunner 2049 bullshit. I love this video.
Can’t believe I missed you coming to the Mall of America TWICE now 😭
The "fiction" on the back of the book Im DYING
Eddy was only 30 minutes from my house omfg that’s crazy
Biloxi is pronounced Bill-Ux-Ee
Your girlfriend literally has a song a dedicated to how much she loves margaritaville and when you have the opportunity to see them all you take Ted instead of her! This is freeping ridiculous.
46:32  he makes them pay
20:10 eddy forgot the two things about florida it always very humid and in the summer its just rain every day
Wait until Eddy finds out about Lulu’s
I haven't watched it yet but I'm so excited 😂😂
Eddy, you and Ted should do a trip visiting every hard rock cafe
PIGEON FORGE WOOOOOOOOO YEAHHHHH BABYYYYY
CANADA REEEEPPPPP 😂
Every day I thank god I work at the Myrtle Beach Margaritaville
Up next? Planet Hollywood
yeah thats a banger of a video
i love the cat in the hat ride
Pronouncing Biloxi as Bill-Ox-Ee hurt my Mississippi soul (it’s bill-ux-ee if ur wondering)
YES!!!!!! YOU WENT TO THE THING!!!!! It's always a favorite of my family on our many road trips across the southwest
Puerto Rico has margaritaville, so... you missed one (or two if you count the one in the airport). Whoops, not every margaritaville in the country.
Eddy… you mention cults, but so far no mention of Parrot Heads. Do some research. That might be a sequel video.
Every day, I pray to god someone paints half of The Bean in Stuart Semple's Blackest Black and "Fuck Anish Kapoor" on the other half.  (◡‿◡✿)
You should go to every HardRock Cafe in America
What’s the next trip
read title. laughed. "well you deserve a view for that."
The weirdest thing in this video is that you could rent any vehicle to drive around the country, and you somehow landed on a pickup truck.
Eddie…. Sorry to say but you missed the Shreveport/Bossier City Margaritaville
As a Canadian I'm thrilled to know that you thoroughly enjoyed both the Rainforest Cafe and the Margaritaville here
You should go to every hard rock cafe in the country.
The immeasurable disappoint I felt when I realized I could’ve met eddy in my home town but now I’ll never get that chance again
Surprised they didn’t get a DUI this entire ride
Eddy, ur a fuckin legend, you’ll always be my hero
Next up, Hard Rock Cafe :)
I haven't finished the video, but it seems like you missed the Margaritaville Waterpark in Buford, GA. I didn't even realize there was one in actual Atlanta, and I live there.
Coming up next year needs to be HardRock Café
Let’s not forget that escape to margaritaville is a musical that exists
49:37 their danm eyelashes are so long it's so unfaaaaaiiaiiaiiaiiair
Yo it has to be the fish and chips
Biloxi - B-lux-e
now do hard rock cafe
Now you have to do all the Landshark and LuLu’s
I can't wait for next year when you do Bubba Gumps!
Oh man, I remember when the Rainforest Cafe video first came out. I actually rewatched it recently, fully unaware you were doing another trip. My god, man, good job. Also, is there any chance you would do every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the US?
The moment you interacted with Buddy you were closer to being Jimmy than any moment on the trip
55:20 I was hoping you were going to say, " do you want to go to every Planet Hollywood"
Every Waffle House next?
McDonald’s next?
When are you going to T-Rex Cafe in Disney Springs to cap it all off?
Next year needs to be Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Bubba Gump has 22 locations in the United States. Just saying…. 👀
We all owe our lives to those Margaritaville employees who served Eddy and Ted. Closing after a rough day takes the wind out of you, yet they served them. Godspeed random Margaritaville employees
Nice moves, Edward
I guess the lesson you learned from last year was "I have found my thing."
you sick bastard
You know it’s funny, but watching Teds video made me hungry, and watching this one has kinda made me feel sick.
Next stop Hard Rock Cafe, and or Planet Hollywood?
54:26 A spread of meats and cheese, you say? On a road trip? I guess you could say it was a car-cuterie board.
Margaritaville in jacksonville beach FL?
Now do Fuddruckers
cant wait for McDicks next year!!
Now you gotta do all the Cracker Barrel restaurants
We need a Hard Rock Cafe version
hard rock cafe next
dollywood sequel CONFIRMED
K where’s the dislike button. We can’t let Eddy do this again.
now eat at every mcdonalds
Ted's intestinal issues were obviously so strong that he reached a sort of clarity at that point. The diarrhea literally purged him of the bad vibes.
"I'm in Florida and I had a margarita today" is the vibe for the rest of my life.
It would be insane but you could make this a trilogy and did all 35 Hard Rock Cafe locations across America and Canada.   Love the series and everything you do your a legend.
The absolute most iconic duo have done it again, I couldn't be happier
You now legally have to do this again because this was so enjoyable idk if I could watch other videos now
Jim-my Buf-fet Ed-dy Bur-back Jim-my Ed-dy Bur-back Buf-fet Jimmy Burback Eddy Buffet Eddy, you had his spirit within you all along.
Hit all 660 Cracker Barrels in the US next
As a resident of Hollywood and a few blocks away from margaritaville. Welcome to our shitty little second Hollywood.
I both hope you can do more of these, and don't wish these on anyone. Love the video none the less.
no you didnt
Eddy had a case of the Mondays :/
Please complete this trilogy with hitting up every Bubba Gump in North America. There's one on the Santa Monica Pier and there's even one in Las Vegas to end your journey there once again
Omg I was just next to a Margi
fantastic
Man have the turns tabled from The Rainforest Cafe video....
You make good fuckin content Eddy 🤘
Eddy, I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but you missed one. It's in Lake of the Ozarks, MO.
Margaritaville’s cocktails are pretty dang tasty lol. I mean it’s total gut rot and a splitting headache type of hangover but very yummy!
not the florida rain
I gotta be honest, the fact that the Tulsa margaritaville turned out to have decent food and be a “refreshing change” is absolutely hilarious and deeply ironic considering I wouldn’t say that anyone has ever said the words “refreshing change” about Tulsa (I say this as a Tulsa native)  Edit: spelling
SALT SALT SALT
looking forward to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company installment next year! :)
You didn't go to the Nassau Bahamas one.
This is just the evolution that any restaurant worker goes through
Love these
tony looks like an off brand josh groban
You missed the Margarita Villes in the MIAMI airport and DETROIT Airport. There is also one in Puerto Rico too which is the US… luv u guys tho, u ate with this vid❤ (Litteraly)
Reminds me so much of the grand tour; you guys are amazing.
Every Hard Rock Cafe next :)
there's no way i'm about to watch a second hour-long video about margaritaville...
Did you skip Gatlinburg 😂
As someone who worked summers at Dollywood all through college I would like everyone to know that she is exactly the saint you think she is
This being number 1 on trending proves human suffering is the best form of entertainment
It probably would have taken too much time, effort, and money out of the main point of the video, but it would have been a cool bonus if you guys would had also visited the three LuLu’s locations while on this trip, as Lucy Buffett, Jimmy Buffett’s sister, owns them. There’s one in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Gulf Shores, Alabama; and Destin, Florida.
Growin up in minnesota the mall of america is a staple for our very few “vacations”. Went there last april ended up walking close to 9 miles that day, and eating at margaritaville. Never again shall my eyes lay upon that dark and cursed place.
"But even the bean couldn't stop my tummy from hurting."  Modern poetry.
...do all the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.s Next!
You skipped the jacksonville beach location
Eddy, have you heard of a restaurant called the hard rock cafe?
Hard Rock Cafe next year?🧐
Hey Eddie you missed the Margaritaville in Jacksonville Florida
You should do Mellow Mushroom next year
It's Biloxi, but you pronounce it like "Biluxi"
I'm just mesmerized by that mustache, for some reason 😐🥺🥸
Final road trip i dont buy it gotta go for the trilogy.
as an alleged employee I’m so upset I didn’t have the privilege of handing you that can of hash
Gotta do Hard Rock Cafe’s next sorry
YOU MISSED ONE IN LAKE OF THE OZARKS MISSOURI!!!!!
Chuck E Cheese trip when?
I’m going to start traveling across the country I hope to see yah down the trail cowboys
“Woah”
spectacular
Bubba Gump! Bubba Gump! Bubba Gump!
So Hard Rock Cafe next?
let out an audible “no” when this video appeared on my home page. not because i won’t watch it, but for eddie’s sanity.
You missed one. There is a Margaritaville at Lake Lanier Islands in Gainesville, GA. I demand justice
What's behind the door Eddy?
Now do bubba-gump
Dang you came to my town, Biloxi. That catfish looked horrible.
TEEEEED
So when's the Bubba Gump food tour?
Eddy: “second and final road trip” Eddy, one year from now: “we’re going to eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country…and Canada!”
Bet you won't do Hard Rock next.
Eddy I can’t explain the feelings of nostalgia I had watching you drive down Pier Park  Spent many a spring breaks in Nike Elite socks and Sperries walking up and down that strip
You guys sadly missed the margaritaville in Miami international airport, it’s before security so you could have went
Shoutout Tim Misny
I really like these tours you're doing. Also, great mustache!
Do the hard rock cafes next😂
*Please eat them all*
just watched Oppenheimer, this is a way more harrowing experience
misny sighting
Okay now do every Cheeseburger in Paradise in the US.  Edit: I have just learned that all Cheeseburger in Paradises are now closed. I need a moment.
I can't wait to see him go to every single McDonald's in America
I cannot wait to see which restaurant you binge next year.  And for your uncensored feet to appear on OF...
I like the hat to cover the thing’s crotch, for modesty.
I can’t believe you were only an hour and a half away from where I live this is my life’s greatest accomplishment and tragedy all in one
I live in the Mobile Gulf Coast and have gotten pretty fucked up at the P'cola and Mississippi ones. His sister has a restaurant in Gulf Shores Alabama called LuLu's!
As a guy from Cleveland it makes sense y Ted likes margaritaville after that one. We’re just so tropical and truly offer the entering of what jimmy envisioned when writing that song (I didn’t even know we had one and I don’t like jimmy buffet)
Next Eddy should eat at every McDonalds in America. Only 13,500 locations!
Lol the syracuse one used to be better. But then they just stopped caring. And it went downhill so fast. They used to have live music and the blender worked. 😂
This video is the best thing I've ever watched high. (Hope that isn't triggered for Ted)
YOU MISSED A MARGARITAVILLE IN AUBURNDALE </3
“You can forget about war, famine, class desparity…I mean those things are still happening but I had a margarita today”  Quote of the century
I cant wait for eddy to go to every mcdonalds in the country and canada
Y'all gotta do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Next.  The seafood restaurant based on the movie Forrest Gump.
Brings me great joy to see a new adventure with the lads. Your suffering at the end tho. Gotta love it
why tease us by blurring ur feet... ur evil...
The crowd begins to chant. "Bub-ba Gump. Bub-ba Gump. Bub-ba Gump.".   I feel like you guys have to complete the trinity at this point.
You forgot the Capitola one 👎🏻
So next year how about you visit...every Applebee's?
32:15 these cottages are freaking awesome btw. they have their own addresses so shuttles can pick you up and take you to the parks, they have their own laundry, they all have a lake view. its super impressive for the price.
this was a masterpiece, but i’m so sorry to say that you missed one. the margaritaville casino and hotel in my home town, shreveport-bossier louisiana on the board walk.
The next one has to be Buckys, finish the trilogy😊
But what about Shreveport, LA?
ted’s rainforest cafe video is how i discovered your channel so im really glad you went back to your root (my roots)
I asked out my girlfriend on that pigeon forge ferris wheel! I live a few hours from there. pigeon forge is a pretty fun way to waste money!
The hero we deserve.
year 5: I ate at every McDonalds in the Country
Can't wait for the 1 stop road trip to visit the only remaining Casa Bonita next year
My next guess is Hard Rock Cafe as a part 3 ngl
Noah's prepping to audit you in your Smosh Funeral yo
I wonder if your credit card company gets confused when you have multiple charges from the same named restaurants over the span of many, many days
Now do it with McDonalds
Margaritaville? More like see you in hellaville
I grew up in FL and your fear of rain is 100% valid. People go faster there because of the straight roads and way more people hydroplane. I used to look at the sky to see where it wasn’t raining and drive that way. From Wewa to St. Joe and back, to Panama, to Clarksville, to Marianna. Anywhere it wasn’t raining, I’d drive that way.
I don’t get it
Don’t say final road trip when we all know you two are going to every bubba gump shrimp next summer
Hard Rock Cafe is pretty cool…
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT
when u just accepted the cult i-
Congrats on #1 trending!
Watching this before Ted's video is like watching oppenheimer before barbie
Again! Again! Again! 👏🏼
Eddy about to enter new levels of Insanity again
Eddy noooooooooooooooo
What about the one in Missouri
Next video: eat at every McDonald's in the US and Canada
47:06 you're the coolest mfer
Wasn’t there a Margaritaville restaurant in Conroe, TX?
This is..... Chefs kiss 😚👌🏻 glad the Canada location gave u a good time! Represent! 🍁
Petition for Bubba Gump Shrimp Co to be the third and final act.
I’m so here for the Cinemax universe of chain restaurant road trips. Like you the storyline here is chefs kiss!
Aw man "2nd and final trip". Let's be honest you'll do another one. One day you will wake up with brainrot like the last 2 times you decided to make these videos.
how do these hot garbage chain restaurants even stay in business? America is wild
Absolutely surreal seeing one of my favorite YouTubers experiencing the two biggest delights I’ve had while traveling: The Thing™️ and Bucees. What an honor!!!!
There are 23 Bubba Gump shrimps across the US and Canada. Just sayin.

9:51 Not since The Monster At The End Of This Book have I been so stunned by a reveal
You missed the one in Michigan (DTW Airport)
Rip teds video, #1 on trending damn
"Oh, no!" screamed Harold  "Here we go again!" screamed George.
my dog died out of nowhere earlier today and this video was a really great distraction from the grief. thank you so much eddy.
"You had self-reflection while you were having diarrhea?!"  Well that's when most of us do the most intense self-reflection
Now do Cracker Barrel.
Now go to every Bubba Gump shrimp, complete the journey, it's also across from the margaritaville  and rainforest cafe at the MOA. You got all 3 right there in a triangle, complete the trifecta
Is the Hard Rock Cafe next?!?!
What about the ville in Shreveport, LA?
Fun fact: the Tulsa Riverspirit casino that you visited almost had structural failure in 2019 when we had the worst flooding the city has ever seen.  People were fully expecting the hotel to collapse.
do. it. again.  Next road trip 2024, suffer for us Edward ☠️🎉
bi-lox-i?!?!
There are a total of 33 Hard Rock Cafe locations in United States as of April 26, 2023
do bubba gump next
i mean, you know you're going to get sick of it partway through, or is that like part of the gimmick that you pretend you won't
You were so brave about about having a tummy ache.
see you all next year when they do all bubba gump shrimp in the USA.
Bubba gumps next!
The honeymoon of a gay couple from Kansas
But you forgot lake of the ozarks MO, time to do it again Eddie
YOU WERE IN MISSISSIPPI AND I DIDNT SEE YOU??! FUCKING KILL ME
You need to eat at every American Girl Doll cafe in the US
the scariest part of this series is the amount of money he had to spend
Florida State Seminoles Softball at 14:52.
#1 on Trending makes it all worth it.
18 bucks for a burguer? That's crazy
Please go to the cheeseburger festival in caseville, Michigan. It’s Jimmy buffet themed. I was forced to go every summer as a child…it’s something.
Next the cruise
Alright is it time for senior frogs 🐸??? Im thinking yes??
I was working at the Atlanta location. Thank you for the kind words!
52:55 I expected the green m&m to say "You look lonely. I can fix that"
Now do it with Applebees
can you visit every mcdonalds next please
He says this will be the last one, but there's only 31 Hard Rock Cafes in the US...
so it was a LITTLE fun the first time wasn’t it?
Eddy playing Stinky Feet against the surprise 4 year old opponent was unexpectedly wholesome 🥹
Here’s hoping this isn’t the final time you 2 do this
I like how you imply this is your last road trip. But we both know you’re doing this again… you better do this again… Eddy if there isn’t a YouTube video ON MY DESK by this time next year I SWEAR TO GOD…
I don’t know how you managed to get me to watch an hour long video about eating at margaritaville but you did so congratulations on making me regret my life as much as you did while doing this…. Whelp time to go watch teds video 🤷‍♂️.
In the thumbnail, the deadness in Eddy's eyes above the life of the mustache is quite the contrast
I wanted a margarita counter but I also respect keeping track would’ve been the nail in your mental health coffin
I just love your content dude, I’ve been watching a few years now and I still look forward to every video you make
Hey Eddy can you do my favorite restaurant next it’s called McDonald’s I’m not sure how many locations there are but good luck 😊
Another duology of masterpieces to put atop the pinnacle of what YouTube has to offer. Eddy and Ted, thank you so much for devoting yourselves to all of the moving parts of both of these trips + the incredible stories you've both told with them as the foundation. They're seriously some of my favourite all time pieces of media not just online but in general. ❤❤❤
The argument with Drew is top tier
Cool video next summer can you visit every McDonalds
he's gonna join the jimmy buffet cult isn't he?
Losing someone at Bucees is exhausting. 😂
Ty for coming through Destin, Sorry its a tourist hell hole now a days.
Man, that magnum p.i stache is top tier
I love how different yours and Teds videos are. You were both in the same place at the same time, but you experienced the trip very, very differently
please do another one of these!
My 4 year old adores that pigeon forge Ferris wheel she asks me to “go to the biggest biggest wheel” at least twice a month (we live five hours away)
yo do it with cheesecake factory tho
The RFC and Margaritaville being accross from each other is a funny coincidence
what about the one in coloma?
My band teacher in middle school was obsessed with Gatlinburg and took us on a field trip there in eighth grade, we went to Dollywood and it was the first place I ever rode a roller coaster with a loop 💖 it’s a pretty sweet theme park iirc
I can't wait until yall do the next themed restaurant 🤪 😂
Me, before the video started, thinking about what happened during the rainforest cafe video: No....Eddy no...Eddyy...nooooo
Can’t wait for Hard Rock Cafe next year!
YEAH SYRACUSE!!! BEST AT BEING THE WORST!!!!!
Bro, you okay?
WHAT ABOUT MARGARITAVILLE IN BOSSIER CITY EDDY
HOLD ON. YOU FORGOT A MARGARITAVILLE IN MONTGOMERY TX 🤨
you're a certified parrothead, eddy
Now do Bubba Gump
Now visit every Starbucks....
Wastin' awaaaay in many Margaritavilles
music at 52:22???
0:30 No. I clicked on the video thinking is this guy really going to do this to himself again???
So as of now there are 23 Bubba Gump restaurants in the U.S.…not sure why I mentioned that but…
Aliens from mars, showed up while ripping solos on v neck guitars. The dinos sharks and robots saw they came in peace, so they killed them with lasers.
Last time I was in Seattle, I had a Manhattan made with a rye whiskey from a regional distillery.  If you get tired of sweet cocktails, Manhattans are pretty good.
Now go to all approximately 660 Cracker Barrels.
Dude wtf, you didn't goto the Bossier City, LA Margaritaville??
jimmy buffet for president
Your next video adventure awaits: Every international Margaritaville. The best part!? You can take a cruise ship to all of them! The Bahamas, Cozumel, and Jamaica await you, and many routes even go to Key West, so a re-visit is in order. And if you want to go even bigger... Head over to the islands of Maui and Oaha in Hawaii to experience the fake Cheeseburger in Paradise (aka "cheeseburger nation/cheeseburger restaurants)... They're so fake that Jimmy Buffet sued their pants off when they first opened, but somehow they still exist. I lived in Lahaina, Hawaii, and worked at the flagship location on front street...I was a host. I'm a 6'4" 240 pound bearded dude that had to wear a plastic hula skirt and say "aloha" to every single customer. If I had a dollar for every sarcastic "nice skirt" comment tossed my way, I could buy the entire Margaritaville empire myself, and still have money to spare for my own plane. The place is bananas off-the-walls busy at all times, and they make strong Mai Tais. They have live music, but due to the terms of the lawsuit, the live musicians cannot legally play any Jimmy Buffet song, even if tipped gobs of money to do so. One musician played a guitar solo behind his back like Jimi Hendrix for an entire song, and didn't miss a note. It was the best live performance I've ever seen, and I've seen Radiohead live. It's a wonderful place... Go there, now.
Why does this feel like The Lighthouse
It’s 2039, Eddie is visiting every Sizzler in the country.
Where was the thing at?  I would really enjoy strolling through there with a belly full of edibles after just roasting a bone in the parking lot
Can’t wait until the cross country road trip to every bubba gump shrimp company locations
Thank God you took a different car this time...
The return of the kings
LETS GOOOOOOO
As a former burnt out Mormon missionary that served in Arizona, let me just say that it makes me feel so validated to see you witness “The Thing” as well.
Next year please do medieval times 💕✨
Eddy got food poisoning from fish and chips.  As a symptom of food poisoning is abdominal pain.  And all ppl who got fish and chips had abdominal pain so we can say they got food poisoning.
The day you released this, is the day I went to Rainforest Cafe for the first time in 9 years
Next go to every McDonald’s in the US
Fins up Jimmy
ive been feeling very stressed out and sad lately and this video is literally giving me +15 dopamine rn
“Oh shit, the coolest motheruffers on the planet!”  That was a truly great brotherly moment.
I was kind of expecting the voice over to slowly transition to Justin McElroy's voice halfway through ngl
I like the part when he drank alcohol.
This is quite possibly the funniest video I’ve ever watched. I was disappointed it was over so quick, despite the fact I’d been watching for a whole hour.
This made me so thirsty for a margarita
They got the quintessential atlanta experience: traffic.
lol i always laugh at dudes trying to pretend to be "manly men" by bashing on drinks that actually taste good, instead of tasting like poison.
Pettition for this man to do midevil times.
Part of me wishes this is a yearly thing, and wonders what next year's restaurant will be.
YAY!!!! Also which one was the Jury Duty one??? Also I hope you go on the cruise ship too.... it COUNTS!!!!
1 year later: I Ate at Every Bubba Gump in the Country
I love these videos Eddie and the truth is I couldn’t do this you’re very brave and my mom loves Jimmy Buffett
the rainforest cafe visit at the end was very full circle and appreciated
I need this as a series with other restaurants 😂😂😂😂😂😂
eddy i beg of you and ted to stay at every great wolf lodge in the country (and canada)
I have never bought YouTuber merch in my entire life. That changed when I bought the margarita cabana shirt.
cant wait for the next installment where he also ventures down to mexico for shits and giggles
I went on a fishing trip that left from the margaritaville in Destin and I can confirm there are a multitude of weird boats. I even saw one that had a waterslide off the back seemingly leading into the ocean.
If you would like another road trip, you should do Medieval Times next! Only 10 locations across the US and Canada.
Amazing.
Eddy, You don't have to live like this man!! Blink twice if someone is like holding your family members hostage and is forcing you to go themed restaurants around the country that should have closed in the early 2000's but are inexplicably still in business. We will send help!
I’m from the gulf coast of Mississippi so obviously I had to see this representation of our royalty
"the day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?" Well yeah duh. Around the 2nd or 3rd run to bathroom and you're sitting on the toilet you start contemplating life choices and reflecting on recent things that have happened to you.😂😂😂😂
Bubba Gump Shrimp called you a sissy boy
I like how there a margaritaville resort in lake of the Ozarks missouri that doesn't have a margaritaville resteraunt
https://youtu.be/YWpmQ4oQhW4
IVE BEEN ON THAT FERRIS WHEEL DUDE
omg i need eddy to go to casa bonita so bad!!!
Eddy, I think you missed the resort in Houston
As someone who lives in SC, and goes to Myrtle kinda often (like once a year, maybe two on a good year) I can confirm that 90% of the food near the boardwalk on the beach, and most of the strip are just wet 😭
I hate how you pronounce Biloxi. There are a lot of places down here in bumfuck that aren’t pronounced the way you think they are. You’re going to hard on the OX, tan.
the only reason i know about bucees is the guy calling it "bussy's"
I just need to know that at least once you asked for the margarita bill
Next year: McDonalds
I saw the thumbnail and my first thought was: That Rainforest video must have made a bunch of money.
#1 on Trending! Massive congrats, Eddy!!!
This gives me some SP7 vibes :)
I've been to Key West once and it is beautiful! It looked like a great time!
If we're making this a yearly thing now, next year Eddy and Ted should go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada
Safe to say you were Wasted Away at Margaritaville
Wait NakeyJakey joined you on this amazing journey?!
ah shit here we go again
Cheesecake factory?
Atlanta the real MVP
Please please please make this an annual series. Pleaseeeee
I'm convinced he's just living in a van, traveling around North America, and finds these restaurants as an excuse to record during it.
Please do this Next Year with Hard Rock Cafes in the US and Canada
Eddy, you missed one! There's a small kiosk in the detroit airport. Youll have to do this again
You never cease to amaze me
may favorite part of these restaurant travels is the different prospective between Eddy and Teds videos.
My plan for my 21st is to get shitfaced at a Margaritaville and this vid definitely set that in stone. I want to be wrecked and surrounded by incongruent island vibes
As someone who has gone to destiny USA a lot since i was a kid, that Margaritaville has always looked that terrible. I went once and was ignored by the waitstaff, there was no line, no one waiting. It was EMPTY. I went to TGI Fridays.
I'm glad Tulsa treated you well
This gives me big Hangover 2 vibes
My only question about this whole thing is why does your friend in Texas look like Captain Quint from Jaws?
My husband used to work at the one on Lake Conroe in Texas. The amount of people that have died there is a bit concerning, before and after it became Margaritaville...  Edit: watching the video now and realized you skipped it lol the title is a lie! Second Edit: I guess restaurants and resorts are considered separate so...technically you told the truth lol
y'all missed the one in Buford, GA on Lake Lanier! its about 30/45 minutes from Atlanta
As a Wisconsinite I have never connected with something more than you saying that the Dells feels like a "Vegas Strip for family tourists" 😂
Every Hard Rock Cafe
I can't wait for episode 3!
It's funny: I'm from Pennsylvania, go to school in Arizona, and have a job in Florida, so I've done the cross-country drive a couple times. There's something really comforting about watching someone else also do this drive and experience the different cultures of each state. I think I can find some state cultures really novel but feel silly for being charmed by it, so it's fun to watch someone else experience it too
EDDY WAS IN SYRACUSE LETS GOOOOOOOOO (destiny usa is shit and kinda dangerous rn but)
Holy shit I laughed like an idiot at 43:45 he sounds like a drunk Fry from Futurama 😂 another great vid  Eddie!
please do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co to complete the MOA trifecta 🔺
bubba gump and hard rock are up next
Bro got stockholm syndrome for the thrill after everything The Milk Man put him through
Next video: "I ate at every McDonalds in the country."
All Cracker barrels when?
I’m so excited for another unhinged journey with the same victim from the first time
Bubba Gumps next
Man I would love to go to that arcade lol, how could you not want to go to an arcade that has everything?
Too bad the Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants all closed, you could have made it a solid 2 months at least eating at nothing but Jimmy Buffet branded restaurants
you will never understand how happy I was when I (a Canadian) heard that Canada was included in this historical journey
Please find another chain to do this at. I live for these videos Eddy.
I'm from AZ, and I know exactly what hotel, and elevator you are talking about. First time on it I genuinely thought it was gonna stop working lmao
There’s actually a restaurant in Ohio called the Original Margaritaville that predates the Buffet chain, shame they didn’t do a courtesy stop there
Can’t wait to see him do Bubba Gumps next :D
Do McDonalds next. That’ll be slightly longer, maybe.
So Hard Rock next year?
It's hilarious to me that Margaritaville is supposed to be an idyllic place when the whole song is basically about a bum who did his girlfriend wrong and is so consumed with the breakup all he does is drink. If that ain't paradise I dunno what is
These videos are an act of hubris.
woo glad you liked San Antonio again! Bucee's is always that terrifying
Hard Rock Cafe next, pls
each video in this series covers two very interesting problems on opposite sides of the same coin. The Rainforest Cafe video is about feeling antagonized by a benevolent and uncaring entity The Margaritaville video is about feeling reverence toward a benevolent and uncaring entity
I feed my cats boiled chicken that’s purposefully slightly over cooked and not seasoned as part of their meal and that chicken you ate in Nashville looks worse than the chicken I make my cats… how do you get chicken so wrong??
You’re living both my dream and nightmare when you do shit like this, Eddy
The sequel I didn't know I needed
Ok next do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Why are margaritavilles and rainforest cafes so frequently colocated?
Eddy you missed the margaritaville bar in Palm Springs 😢
Please please please do hard rock cafe next year
“ cheese burger in paradise!!”
I don't believe in landlocked Margaritaville
I can’t wait to see “every McDonald’s in the country” next year
*sees the Florida part of the trip*   ...holy shit, Florida really does feel like another reality from the rest of the US, WTF???
Amazing video, I loved it. Seriously makes me wanna take a vacation at a Margaritaville Resort.
Please come to the Midwest and do cracker barrel next
You pay a bill, not a check.
In the end, Jimmy was the real winner
I go to destiny often and have never been to the margaritaville there. I actually thought it was shut down bc of how dead it always is. Your review is exactly what i thought it'd be lmao
i really hope for the next "i ate at every _______ in the country" we go to bubba gumps next 😭😂
Excited for the sequel but there’s no way this’ll be as good as the original.
Eddy I so very seriously would like to do this after spending a few days eating only at the Times Square Margaritaville and staying at the hotel. Can you possibly give an estimate on how much this would cost for me to attempt????
Your friend at the second margaritaville looks like Quint from JAWS
I remember going to the Margaritaville in Las Vegas as a kid and seeing the mermaids perform, truly a life changing experience; props to you Eddy for getting through this a second time
Eddy, you didn't need to do this. I'm so glad you did how else would I have learned about that WILD alien museum.
“The day you had self reflections the day you had diarrhea?” Killed me 😂
you gotta go on the margaritaville cruise line to end this journey
Even though you somewhat suffered, I am so happy to watch this video! I've watched the Rainforest Cafe one at least 3 times
doing this a second time reminds me of people that went up everest and said, 1 mountain's not enough.
as someone who suffers stomach issues: -Ginger beer/ginger tea -Tums -Seirogan (Japanese tummy medicine)
going to every hard rock cafe... in the world
honestly thought he just changed the rainforest cafe thumbnail but no. its a blessing. an eddy blessing  :)
time to spend a year going to every MacDonald's in the us and canada
Hard Rock Cafe 2024?
Margaritaville cruise video????
Can’t wait till “I ate at every Mcdonalds in the country” drops
the emotional arc this video takes is crazy
We are so back
The fact you guys met the same dude as last years road trip is actually insane
Your entire plans almost being ruined by traffic in Atlanta was the most authentic experience you could’ve gotten in this god forsaken state
You fool. Everyone knows to avoid the Cat in the Hat ride if you want to keep your sanity
Jimmy Buffett was in  Kappa Sigma fraternity   if anyone cares. my husband used to tell me that like every 3 months in college
Thought he was gonna end up at people’s doors saying stuff like would you like to hear about our lord and savior, Jimmy Buffett? 💀
I haven't started the video yet but I'm going to guess that since I saw Ted has one of these videos you got dragged along on another adventure
mmmmmm yummmmmm
Every starbucks next year
i am uncontrollably laughing at the green screen photo Eddy had to take alone. the music just adds to the greatness
This man looks exactly like I had imagined a person would look like if they were to eat at every Margaritaville in the country and then make a Youtube video about it.
it feels intentional releasing this the day before barbenheimer. eddy knew they could never compete with this masterpiece
This is the greatest early birthday gift that you can give me. I hope you still have a bit of your sanity left.
You look like Daniel Radcliffe if he stopped giving a shit. Keep it up bro!!!
Its amazing that 2 of my favorite youtubers that i had no idea knew each other are great friends and can do 2 multi week road trips like this and make amazing content around them!!!
i watched this and the rainforest cafe one because i knew you’d have to go to nashville for both and it made me feel seen as a nashville resident
congrats being #1 on trending! this was equally insane
What other touristy gimmicky restaurants are there with under 50 locations?
Early gang
YESSIR
You know, you changed your latitude, but I am not sure you changed your attitude.
need chip clip merch from that one video
You missed one in Montgomery Texas on lake conroe
MY MAN!
Well jokes on you Eddie, 'cause I already I ate them all (The restaurants, not at them, I would not do that)
if i had a nickel for every time this happened, i’d have 2 nickels, which is weird that it happened twice
I've got bad news, you forgot the 4 Air-Margaritavilles in the US.
Hate to do it, but you missed one...  Honolulu.
can you come to my house next
"Final"
You need to do the hat trick and go to all the Hard Rock Cafes or something
Yeah that sounds about right for Atlanta traffic :( Sorry you hit it but I'm glad they were able to help you
Nothing like a 1hr video from eddy at night..
can't wait for them to figure out there are Margaritaville cruises
I hope James sees this.
YES THE THING! it's iconic. Love passing the signs on all my childhood road trips with my family.
Jesus, I watched this whole goddamn thing and enjoyed it. Maybe we're all insane.
Hoping that @soundslikeacultpod covers this cult!
Hey, margaritaville doesn’t own the Casino lol we just have them in a section. It’s the tribes
The Thing is worthy of a video in itself. It has a wild history, and has changed constantly. And that mummy at the end was a model made by a very famous modelmaker that made those old circus attractions, the "mermaids"
Someone needs to do an edit of that one scene from Blade Runner 2049 but it's Eddy staring at a hologram of the green M&M.
LMFAO, the blur on your feet at the beach had me dying! NO FEET PICS FOR YOU!
My life motivation is to go to Margaritaville with Jakey....
Dang I knew this was an ez way to get food poisoning lmao , I had my doubts at the rainforest video 😔 my condolences
Alright folks they have to do one more, there’s gotta be another chain like this. Does planet Hollywood still exist?
AGAIN????
You guys should do Bubba Gump next. They've got theme, a supercluster, and it's right next to the others Mall of America.
Ted may be bipolar. It makes no sense to enjoy beach themed restaurants in Ohio instead of the actual beach.
It's so weird watching a youtuber walk around and talk about an area I frequent for vacation lmao. Might just try the Margaritaville there after seeing this
so you're doing bubba gump next year right?
Eddy I am concerned for your health please stop however I will bet 40 dollars that if you find this video successful you will make this a series
I lived in Florida (you can leave your condolences below) for 11 months last year, and I came to this conclusion: 'tis a soup place. You know it's about to start raining because the thunder and lightning. It is a cursèd, back assward soup place.
how do we pay for your toes?
honestly saw the rainforest cafe one, and now the madman is back.
Worst Margaritaville!! We don’t call ourselves Sewercuse for nothin 🥇
Seriously though, my parrot head parents could do this trek TWICE over in a heartbeat lol. You're not that far off calling it cult-like.
I assume it was an intentional choice to put Vivaldi’s “Winter” over all the Summery images
The "final" one he says... rule of thirds, eddy, rule of thirds....
Damn, I was just a few blocks from Eddy and Shlat when they were in San Antonio. The only downside would be I’d have to go to Margaritaville
Ah shit…
Rain forest cafe!!!! We will never forget
Eddy needs to up his ordering game 😭 unless allergies/picky eater I feel like half of the problem is that he makes bad menu choices
52:50 "You look lonely, I can fix that"
37:26 funny enough, pretty sure I have been to that exact museum, honestly really cool.
Cool vid, hey so did you know there's like 22 Bubba Gump locations in the US and Canada? Crazy right?
We can now assume from the two trials that the more miserable Eddy feels is greatly proportionate to the happier Ted feels
Congrats on being #1 on trending! I hope you make your money back on this non-Margaritaville-sponsored trip.
This video was how I learned that the Mohegan Sun location shut down in 2019.
Slippin Jimmy strikes again
They say this is the final time they do this.... but one has to wonder if that's true. No idea what other franchise would be realistic, but I adore the suffering that goes into this type of video.
Dream blunt rotation: 41:30
soooo hard rock cafe next right?
I take it you're not a fan of themed restaurants. More of the "I just want decent food and a clean, nothing extravagant restaurant." Nothing wrong with that but then why do you put yourself in places you know you'll probably get annoyed with after a while?
I have a feeling that every Hard Rock Cafe is next...
Bobby humo shrimp next please!!
I hope they do more of these. Even if it’s every few years. I love these videos so much
guys. you missed one. in Osage Beach, Missouri.
Wait you came to Vegas and didn’t call me? Come on brah I would have joined you.
Hey, uhhh. You guys missed the Missouri one....
I also once went to a buc-ee's and i lost my friend and family in the stuffed animal isle, i felt like a lost dog :,)
That statue of liberty is truly inspired
Waiting for Cracker Barrel
can’t wait for you to visit every mcdonald’s location. that will be awesome
Thank you for reminding me why I never leave California
Your storytelling is top notch 👏🏾😂
You ever think about how someday, in the near future, there will be virtually no one who thinks about Jimmy Buffet, and all of these restaurants will be robot McDonald’s. 🤖🤡
“I think it’s tinnitus” had me cackling As someone who lives in Atlanta… traffic is accurate.
So next is the hard rock, right? There’s like 33 or 34 in the United States.  And it’s prevalent internationally too, so…. International Hard Rock Cafe/resort tour!
this is my barbenheimer
I think you missed one. Bossier City, LA.
But Eddie! What about the Margaritaville Cruise?
I think you know deep in your heart what's next. 165 restaurants, 24 hotels, and 11 casinos. Hard Rock Cafe.
i visited pigeon forge last year for a wedding, and also felt like it was reminiscent of wisconsin dells.
god gives his achiest tummies to his strongest soldiers 😔
Now do every McDonalds in America
You should come to England and do every Wetherspoons
Big "Blade Runner" vibes towards the end of the video
What's next? Olive garden?
A What If "Dinosaurs were part of the U.S. Civil War" outdoor museum exists in Virginia. It includes statues Stone Wall Jackson with a robot arm fighting a spinosaurus. It's called 'Dinosaur Kingdom 2' if you're intrigued l.
❤❤❤
We know why eddy we know why
Yes!!!!!!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/ffTVreQE39c?feature=share
There is one on the Philadelphia airport
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Aliens did 9/11
Pee pee poo poo
good video
the cleveland leg of your trip is about par for ohio. extremely unappetizing but some people get brainwashed into liking it.
Who was the designated driver?
❤
Now do Chuck E. Cheese
No one:  The rental car agent getting the Tacoma back with 9,000 miles added to the odometer: 👁👄👁
13:30 “rubs buc-ee’s nuts” — Eddy Burback, 2023
your use of Vivaldi in this video was absolutely on point
so im guessing bubba gump is next
48:30 holy shit its weezer
I like maragaritas but damn that’s a lot of the same
"But you don't get to see my feet because you didn't pay meeeeee."  Eddy, you sexy sexy tease.
I saw this video and then suddenly had flashbacks to the past month when I would spend 5 minutes vaguely scrolling on Twitter and see various people at Margaritaville locations without any other context
Love how Eddie clearly has a stalker and plays it off as “what are the odds?😮”
Im starting to think you LIKE doing this to yourself 😂😂
Anybody else ready for the “I ate at every Subway in the country” next year
Absolutely floored you did a sequel
Can't wait for next year's nightmare road trip 🥰
You didn't go to the hotel Margaritaville in lake Conroe Texas. So you really didn't go to every Margaritaville in the United States
But have you ever been to their resort at Lake of the Ozarks 🤨
the resorts are top notch. the restaurants tho?..  I was nervous this entire video.
Hey Eddy, did you know there's 22 Bubba Gump Shrimps in the United States?
i need to know more context about the kid playing stinky feet with you. what was their reaction after you won?? did you talk to them at all??
Next year you guys should find and visit every world famous Stinky Feet arcade machine and beat a kid at every one. Play against the kid at the game too.
I finally can stop re-watching the rain forest cafe video again for the 5th time this week.. Now I have 2 videos to re watch! Thank you eddy for your sacrifice..
Next is Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
yess boy this is the quality kind of content i need
Anyone see the hellcat?
Ok now do McDonald's
I see why FTX spent $600,000 on this
The Syracuse one being the worst does not surprise me even in the slightest
Bill-UCKS-ee, guys. UCKS, not ox 😂
wait a damn minute u missed lake lanier :(
Can you go to all the Hard Rock Cafes so when you go to The Hard Rock Cafe in City Walk Orlando you'll have Margaritaville flashbacks?
I vote Eddy and Ted go to every Bubba Gump in the US next year. 🍤
now do McDonalds
obsessed with these videos
You forgot about the Margaritaville in Jamaica
I only realized midway through the video that I was thinking of *Warren* Buffet
Somebody get this man some fiber supplements
I got food poisoning at the SATX one
Yearly eddy chain restaurant tours are gas ⛽️ 😂
Edward what do you put in your hair to control volume
getting lost in bucees is a quintessential texas experience 😂
Tell me another Mississippian cringed at his pronunciation of Biloxi
Is it me or was Shreveport skipped
wow The Thing museum has changed totally since the 80s.
Hell yeah! come on down to Syracuse. We have a Spencer’s and………..
But what about Bubba Gump?
Watching eddy fall for the jimmy propaganda is the best part .
I'm so so tired of listening to the name Jimmy throughout this video lmao
You missed Bossier City.
Jokes on you i unblurred the piggies loser
That Jambalaya looks horrifying. I am so sorry you ate that.
as a universal orlando employee, I am so glad you got to experience the fever dream of cat in the hat
I thought this was a re-upload at first ☠️
so will we get the Hard Rock Cafe version next year?
Won't listen to a BINKLEY, under 1 minute later: Here's my friend SHLAT.
It was nice to see you so appreciative of the one that stayed open for you guys, when i worked in restaurants a huge pet peeve of mine was people coming in right after we started to close the kitchen wanting to be seated but I would have gladly stayed open to further a silly goal like eating at every Margaritaville in North America.
32:21 A spy shot of Eddy filming himself and waving to no one would've been amazing 🤣
Do Mid-Evil Times next year.
Why you forget the Margaretaville Resort on Pensacola Beach in Florida?
Ahhh omg he went to my local mall
Love this!
I don't know if this is a fever dream but I swear to god, when I was 10 years old I read a book about a pig who was forced live in the closet of a hotel for it's entire life but I vividly remember this man's face being on the cover of the book
Cant wait for freshman high school English teachers to use this video to explain the concept of the hero’s journey
So this is I find out the margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio is not affiliated with the jimmy buffett restaurants 😂
dude imagine how his liver feels after this
shlatt is racist btw
I WAS SCARED U WERE GINNA SKIP TULSA
Damn
I feel the urge to visit the Times Square Margaritaville now.
Can't wait to watch the Bubba Gump Shrimp tour next summer! 22 in the US
Every McDonalds or you’re not real
As someone who grew up near an epicenter of this midwest take on tourist attractions, thank you.
47:12 Shout out to that guy who is the Coolest MF’ing Wingman on the Planet
So uh  You missed one  You went to the first Jimmey Buffett's Margaritaville, but the actual first Margaritaville is outside the chain and in Sandusky, Ohio  Sorry for ruining your whole trip lol
I went on cat in the hat as a kid. It was dope
It’s too bad Jimmy is actually an asshole in real life. Both my boss and my husband had BAD interactions with him, and not as fans, mind you. My boss ran across him at a airport he used to work at in West Palm Beach and my husband was trying to hang out with Jimmy’s daughter (they were friends in high school). Both times, super jerk.
Every bubba gump shrimp when
Now it’s time for you to eat at every single Bubba Gump’s in the country and the world…
If you want to feel better then you've ever felt in your life, don't eat at restaurants, and don't take cruises, Zoltar out!
So weird hearing my town Wisconsin Dells from Eddy
Imagine if you guys went to all the cheesecake factories. At least the menu is way bigger lol
This video didn’t end up with Eddy murdering Ted like I thought he would… but a great video nonetheless.
“Needed the room to get some work done” my man was getting head
Now do it with mcdonalds
Do a road trip for every Medieval Times next!
I love how the What If museum is just the plot of that one Ninja Sex Party song.
Love that y’all came to my small town and our states prized food, catfish.
Holy cow they've renovated the hell out of that The Thing tourist trap! When my family stopped off at it moving cross country it was basically just an empty warehouse where the only notable things were the Thing itself (not in a display that nice, it was just a coffin-shaped box with a glass top you could look through) and that same Winston Churchill car except they billed it as *might* have belonged to Hitler. My Mom and Dad probably would've felt less scammed if it had had all that alien v. dino stuff haha
It’s eddys turn to drive his friend insane…finally..
54:13  dog
the child definitely beat you at stinky feet
I bet Jimmy himself hasn't eaten at every Margaritaville
Lol, YMH would be proud/disgusted.
Do Topgolf
DANNY IS FROM OHIO
YES EDDY !!!
somebody ship me a cheeseburger in paradise in a transoceanic shipping container cos that looks ravishing rn
now do every bubba gump
Nobody in the comments is time stamping the different locations? I mean.. it couldn’t be me but I was hoping it was one of you.
Medieval Times? Jousting, Hawk shows, no silverware, no food options, I bet it would be a blast to do that a dozen times
I love these sagas so much
OH GOD
why are you doing this to yourself again???????? can't you just post a meme reaction like everyone else?????? god
he does it like no one else
This video has NO RIGHT being so ridiculously funny and creative. Ya killed it Eddy. Can't wait to see where you go next. I hope it's not Bubba Gump or something
Hey hate to be that guy but you missed the one in bossier
honestly as someone from tulsa im both disappointed and not at all surprised that our margaritaville had the shortest segment of the video and was probably the weirdest one. also surprised u didn’t point out the sad state of the river. i’ve lived here 10 years and have never seen that river full at all. the bottom is always showing. very tropical
You are so legendary 😭  And now I kinda want to see you two take on Hard Rock Cafe
Please someone tell me why they would rent a TRUCK to do a 9k mile road trip???  Great video btw lol
The Thing is one of my favorite places I love it so much
U missed the one at Lake Lanier Islands in Georgia.
Two for two, Canada has the best food.  Love it here.🍁
"OH SHIT! COOLEST MOTHERFUCKERS ON THE PLANET!"
gotta do medieval times next
Ted might be susceptible to Stockholm Syndrome.
“The day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea?”  Absolutely perfect.
I remember going to the Myrtle Beach margaritaville as a kid and dang that hurricane was terrifying to me.
You missed the Margaritavile in Sandusky Ohio
Now you guys have to go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S. ...aaaannnd Canada! :D
Here's another torture idea: do Bubba Gump
i met eddy at an applebees a few months ago and im shocked this man has this much stamina for casual dining chains. eternal salutes to you my friend, great video ❤
Number 1 on trending!!!!!! Congrats Eddy!
legend
Can't wait for eating at every Hard Rock Cafe to complete this trilogy
wasn’t expecting a schlatt jumpscare ☹️
Ive never been so excited for an upload in the entire existence of this wretched fucking site. Thank you Eddy. This is what I wanted for Summer.
“final trip” okay eddy see you next summer when you hit all the hard rock cafes
I was here (#1 on trending as of now)
13:55 “Hey I met you on the rainforest cafe video” “That nice… you’ll never guess what we are doing”
Eddie: “The day you had ‘self reflection’ is the day you had DiArRhEa!?!🤨😀” Ted: 🥴😀🤭🤗🫠✨    49:54
Fantastic video set, fellas. Next year you should consider staying at every Great Wolf Lodge in America (and Canada). Some of the same locations, some very different.
As someone who’s lived and worked in Atlanta I’m glad you got the full Atlanta experience of unexpected hospitality and an absurd amount of traffic
shoulda went to dollywood...
My god, kudos to you Eddy, #1 on Trending
Ayyye PCB! I wish I had known you were in town
Legitimately thought this was a reupload because Margaritaville and Rainforest Cafe are the same thing in my head.
I like your consistent use or Vivaldi (Winter is my channel’s theme song 😂 )
what about the one in puerto rico eddy
Where's all your footage for Iowa and Missouri? ;(
They said the sequel couldn't top the original... They were wrong...
37:24 HOLY SHIT IS THAT A WISCONSIN DELLS REFERENCE
Waiting on them Eddy eating at every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in the country... (only 22 of them)
44:42 I'm from the NY area and they have these stores in all of the malls lol
I'm pretty sure there's a Margaritaville in bossier city, LA
Ted is the second wind king. Hits his stride on the back half of both the Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville trips.
BIL-UCK-SEE, Mississippi despite the spelling
destiny usa is the most traumatizing area of the state of new york
great video! i can’t wait to see what you do next year :) hard rock cafe? bubba gumps shrimp? medieval times? planet hollywood? so many fun options!
i waited so patiently throughout the entire video just to see how he reacts to the one in Syracuse. I go to that mall all the time and I dont think ive ever seen a single person eating there.
Next, you should visit all of the bizarre celeb “worlds” like the Elvis one, Dollywood, etc.  there are a handful of weird celebrity/musician theme parks across the US and it would offer more variety!
Every Medieval Times in North America or I’ll cancel you.
eddy number ONE on trending burback
😭😭😭he did a sequel, dear god Eddie you’re a true hero
Can’t wait for next year’s video about Hard Rock Cafe and 2025’s video about Bubba Gump
I was born and raised in Biloxi and I can 10/10 confirm you are pronouncing it wrong 😅 Great Video! 🍹
you are taller than i thought you were
Thank you for ruining your kidneys for our entertainment
Hey eddie there are like 34 hard rock cafes in America
waiting to see that bubba gump journey
If you ever decide to eat at every Medieval Times in North America, you can visit the one Canadian location as well, in Toronto, the centre of the universe.
Why does he do this to himself
I’m here for the hairy chest…
I dig the video format, but boy do I feel bad for you having to eat at all those places, send this man your thoughts prayers and dogecoin everybody
Eddy I thought I Venmo’d you the money why am I not seeing the toes
Go to Casa Bonita in Colorado!
Thank you for your service sir 🫡
i got tired just watching the video
i think i blacked out halfway through this video and ordered the margarita shirt
47:12 thought Ted was saying this or something but no it was unplanned. Love it
Next year: Hard Rock Cafe
Alright, next year, gotta hit every Subway.
Bubba Gump is next. I got a feeling 😅😅
You went to every Margaritaville in North America, and still didn't find your lost shaker of salt.  My grandfather absolutely loved Jimmy Buffett, but I don't know if he ever visited one of these restaurants. He was pretty content to hang out and eat at Waffle House every day, which everyone in my family but me though was odd. Growing up, it felt like the two of us were the only members of our family that "got" each other, and only much later did we find out that we were both Autistic. I miss him, but this video brought back memories of being a kid, getting in his truck, and him already having the tape ready to play my favorite Buffett song (Volcano).
im from near biloxi and its so surreal seeing my home in one of your videos omg.. i grew up going to the Margaritaville casino (it was insane. had a volcano with a slide that the dancers (on stilts) went down.. idk..) also as a mississippian, i doubt you'll ever find yourself here again, but i wouldn't order seafood from any casinos LOL anyways that arcade keeps getting bigger and bigger and its genuinely one of the coolest things we have on the gulf
Oh my god I work games at a theme park and seeing stinky feet and hearing that horrid horrid song just gave me war flashbacks
You guys gotta go on the margaritaville cruise
Next Year you should both go to every Burger King.
calling it now, Hard Rock Cafe is next
21:39 THAT is Joe Biden? Jimmy Buffet...Joe Biden... wait holdon--
Next video be like: going to every McDonald’s in America and Canada
Did y’all consider Cozumel ?
no Missouri Margaritaville? no Lake Ozark Landshark? feeling cheated…
I can’t wait for next years “I Went to Every —- in the Country” I wonder what it’ll be
The sequel no one knew we would get
All the Medieval times is next. There’s only like 8 so you need to do it
In before "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country" drops
You can’t just skip Dollywood like that man come on  I expected more from you eddy. I will see you in my office after this video.
So….hard rock cafe next?
So…planet Hollywood next?
He is back….
I finally get it. Jimmy Buffett is the "live, love, laugh" for boomers.
34 hard rock cafe in America
I cant tell if he’s referencing It’s 5 ‘O clock Somewherew by Alan Jackson ft. Jimmy Buffet every time he says “What would Jimmy buffet do?”
You didn’t do Margaritaville at Sea! Incomplete!
truly a magnificent journey...  again   well done eddy and ted
I walked away from this video for 5 minutes and aliens were giving dinosaurs technology. Wasn't this video about a buffet restaurant or something?
So … how many Hard Rock Cafes are there in the US and Canada? Just curious….
now you have to go to every bubba gumps restaurant
The kind of content we need
I think you two should do the Hard Rock Cafe next
Do Bubba Gump next!
Next challenge: Eating at every Olive Garden in USA. Will only take around 300 days but you got this Eddy!
why do you do this to yourself
I live near the margaritaville in syracuse ay destiny usa Terribke service  Terrible food
Where the Skibbity Toilet museum at tho? 👀
I guess you could say your head hurts, your feet stink, and you don't love jimmy
Fun fact Margaritaville just opened a senior living community in Florida 😌
“I Ate at Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. In the Country” (21 US locations and 2 in Mexico) please Eddie 🙏
jesus christ
Hey love this one but for the next idea do bubba gump shrimp co pls
You should go to every wetherspoons in the uk next year
48:23 OH MY GOD ITS WEEZER AHHHHH
No you haven't cuz one is opening here in Boston in 3 weeks can I be video? My name is Jonathan and I'll be a cook there
So when is the "I ate at every Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co in the Country" gona be released? I am patiently waiting
As a former burnt out Mormon missionary that served in Arizona, let me just say that it makes me feel so validated to see you witness “The Thing” as well.
Hate to be that guy but you missed one inside a hotel in tulsa oklahoma
Señor Frog's next year
*I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!* You look like if loloveruled and Noah Samsen had a baby. And that is NOT an insult, I swear <3
Please do medieval times next
So we're going to see a Hard Rock Cafe video next, to finish the trilogy.
fun fact: the Chicago bean is full of magical wizard shotguns
You should do every Bubba Gump Shrimp CO. Say it’s your birthday every time and ask for trivia
Yall came by Biloxi!? I wish I knew
thank you eddy for showing me the "normal" side of america and realizing how fucked up america is
I wasn't creeped out by The Cat In The Hat until I was trapped in the ride once and while waiting for a TM to release me it was dead silent, but all the parts were moving and what made it even creepier was the fact that the wait time was low, so when I got onto the ride essentially there was no one in front, or behind me, so that added a little anxiety over thinking "do they know i'm even here?" I never had to wait for a TM evacuate me off a ride due to breakdown so I had no idea how long I'd have to wait.
I hate to be like this but I'm from Santa Cruz CA and I'm pretty sure that there's one in Capitola.... Plz don't block me
"For the Second and FINAL time"  Oh you know you don't believe that! There's at least 1 more time!  A MEDIEVAL TIME...s
Now time to go to all the Bubba Gump shrimp co in USA and Canada lol
Can't wait for round 3
Oh this is gonna be a series huh.
Can’t wait for y’all to go to every Hard Rock Cafe next!
Burger burger burger margaritas margaritas burger nachos toothpicks with sunglasses burger burger margarita
😂 52:59
Next year medieval times 😇
Fuck yeah dude, A+ for supporting customer service workers. Especially because you made the distinction that it’s not the company but the workers that really hooked you guys up. Love to see it 👌👌👌
This is well timed as I listened to a different Buffett album in chronological order every day through June.
Eddy and Ted experienced some genuine southern hospitality in Atlanta
I love that when the Volcano goes off at about @16:15, there is just nobody in the restaurant.
I can't wait till next year when you do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and have to not only eat at 21 Bubba Gump Shrimps but also watch Forrest Gump 21 times
I think the key lime pie tastes more like lemons.
I think Bubba Gump shrimp should be next
I'm sorry you had to come to Atlanta.
As a resident of Wisconsin I want to see Eddy and Ted do a cursed Dells vacation now
i like how both of you were sponsored by sofi
RIP for when he does Bubba Gump Shrimp
You look like you’re wearing the mustache glasses disguise.
How TF did you manage to capture my attention for an entire 58 minutes and 44 second (minus the ad) with a video about Margaritaville? You are a true master of your craft, sir!
Next go to the biggest mall in every state.
I’m not even 10 minutes into this and I’m giggling.
Oh we’ve been blessed by the restaurant chain gods
This video was phenomenal! I literally laughed out loud several times and just adore the way y'all edit. Kudos to your stomach & liver for surviving that much deep fried everything and sour mix soaked margaritas!! Can't wait to see where you choose to torture yourselves with next year!
he didn’t go to the one in Osage Beach 😢
Hard Rock Cafe next right? 🤔
So next up. Hard Rock Cafe or Old Spaghetti Factory?
Eddy, your commitment to the bit is very admirable
Seeing this video at the top of my feed when I opened the app is the reason I love existing during the era of YouTube
the way you said Syracuse hurt me
The way you said Biloxi was a jump scare lol
Now do McDonald's
I get it now. Eddy does enough of these, he gets recognized and…the best service every time he goes out to eat.
now you guys should go to the yellow deli
Eddy, you took one for all of us! Thank you sir for for the laughs and the heartburn!!
I’d pay any amount of money to see Deep Eddy’s uncensored goes
Nice that you passed through Syracuse NY!.  Yes the Destiny Mall is soul crushing as is its Margaritaville
Just found your channel a couple months ago and just watched the rainforest cafe video. So this is such a treat. Thank your for yalls service.
You didn’t go to the Margaritaville in Puerto Rico
I am so glad we got a spiritual successor  to the rainforest video. I loved the music too!
I like this.
Next year you should visit every Chipotle in the country 🤪
I'm from Miami just wanted to update you on that dancing guy he doesn't stop, I'm not sure how he makes his money he does not take donations. And he's always dancing near the bridge that's connecting to Brickell.  He has music that's constantly blasting from his bicycle.  Whatever that guy does for a living I hope hes having fun doing it. Because it's expensive as heck to live here.
As a native Ohioan I can confirm that the establishing shot shown of Cleveland at 46:34 is a perfect distilation of the entire state
GO TO ALL THE BUBBA GUMPS NEXT PLS
You’re not done. At least one left in Georgia at Lake Lanier
How is this 58 minutes long lol
Road Trip! Road Trip! Road Trip! Road Trip! Road Trip! Road Trip!! <3
As someone from Mississippi biloxi triggered me
Next chain you should do is bubba gump
i think dolphins owe everyone money
yo man, this is the plot to supersize me two. eat only the food from margaritaville for a few weeks
I have the margaritaville crocs.  When I get sad studying, I go there in my brain and set my computer background a photo of the PCB margaritaville restaurant.
Your living the life bro
I can't wait for the video of every Bubba Gump's in the Country
This is a really small bit in the video, but for anyone wondering what’s up with the billboard at 46:32, it’s for a lawyer we have in Cleveland named Tim Misny. Tim Misny is kind of infamous here - his advertising either consists of five-second commercials where he either says “I’m Tim Misny. I’ll make them pay” or “I’m Tim Misny. You know what I do”, as well as billboards that only consist of his eyes (like what you see in this vid). No contact information, no description of what he does - just his eyes staring straight into your soul as you drive into town. They’re *everywhere* in Cleveland.   Among other things, Tim Misny also sponsors a 5K held in downtown Cleveland called the “I’ll Make Them Pay 5K” (which you receive a Tim Misny-themed clock after finishing), and he lives on a 55-acre property that he calls “Misnyland”. His latest wave of billboards consist of him pointing at the camera with the caption “Drive safe, Ohio!” - again, no contact info, no summary of who he is or what he does. Just him staring you down as you drive past.   This man is the closest thing to a cultural icon that we have, and I live in fear of what billboard he comes up with next.
not a spencers meme in 2023 lol
That Cleveland recap was just disrespectful
Hate to break it to you pal,  .but you missed his cruise ship..which..I've heard is amazingly disappointing  2 weird day trip to Bahamas out of palm beach  .noone else on the cruise I've heard So this list doesnt count till you complete the list
Alright now they gotta do Hard Rock Cafe
Livin like Larry!  Also the color of that jambalaya....
bro missed the margaritaville in jacksonville beach
My jaw dropped when I saw this on my home page
This is my Barbenheimer
Do bubba gump shrimp you cowards
God fucking dammit
next road trip has to be Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
TIL Capitola Margaritaville isn’t a real Margaritaville
Cheesecake Factory next!!
Eddy.. deep down we know you secretly loved every minute of this truly disturbing adventure
You can’t prove THE THING isn’t a REAL skeleton covered in papier-mâché!
myrtle beach is a shit hole. too bad they didn't have one in charleston.
you should do hard rock cafe next and come to alaska~
Cant wait for them to visit all 1569 Applebees over the next few years.
I needed this.
Dude developed Stockholm syndrome for Rainforest Cafe.
So has anyone told Eddy about the Margaritaville cruise ship?
Why would you do this to yourself again?
Bubba Gump
drink driving ?
Great video Eddy! I look forward to the one where you read every one of Jimmy Buffet's novels
Who roadtrips in a truck?
girl.
yoooooooo you didnt come to the one in Medford OR.......
that chicken is dryer than ben shapiros wife
girl.
I love that Eddy just says the Tulsa Margaritaville is "really big" and not that it's a 50,000 foot addition to an already giant casino. It's like the Vatican city of River Spirit
“i’d like to live all my life in margaritaville.”
I like how Eddy stayed mainly positive through this trip while he was not feeling the rainforest Cafe trip. Can't wait to see Ted who seems like he hated the trip but liked the Rainforest Cafe trip.
Me, my dad, and my brother went into Buc-ee's earlier this year and we all dissociated as soon as we walked in, I don't even know how we made it back to the car
40:50 it would make a funny scene if Ted threw the book out the window
Im waiting for the mext one being a multi-year tour going to every chilis in the country (and mexico)
Never did I think I’d be sitting on my couch watching yet another American food chain marathon.
Hearing people pronounce Biloxi correctly grates my ears. Everyone. Says. Biluxi. That’s how you say it. I waited to hear what you had to say and you literally said one sentence, and didn’t even say the state. I can’t help but feel like you were less than happy about it….. hurt my fee-fees ngl.
The Syracuse experience is very on brand for Syracuse, I’m sorry
EDDY I'm really hoping I just missed it, but I think you forgot the Margaritaville in Jacksonville, FL
Eat at every Cracker Barrel in the US
I just watched the original again yesterday, and now this comes out. How did you know???
I'm sorry about your upset tum-tum Eddy
I love that Eddy and Ted blamed each other for the Orlando cottage
you're a f***ing idiot...and i love you. please pimp yourself to youtube more. lots of love. UK
There's only one location but I'd love to see a video from Eddy about Casa Bonita once it reopens
Did you skip the Gatlinburg, TN Margaritaville?
The Thing museum is the most American Southwest thing I have ever seen 🤣
I'm actually gonna be kinda sad if they don't keep this a tradition every year lol
wow eddy, congrats on getting to #1 on trending!
4:57 "the group got some onion rings as an appetizer" thats where I clicked off this video
You look like the muppet Groucho Marx
Destin to Pier Park is 45 minutes LOL. You must have got caught in that traffic
Love me a Teddie Burvison road trip
Ed kemper at margaritaville LETS GOOO
57:39 "am I in the shot?"
Can't wait until next year when Eddy visits every McDonald's in the world
This is hilarious 😂😂😂
it's been funny as hell seeing ted's and eddy's alternate perspectives on these events, like seeing two sides of a war
congratulations i think if i tried this i would die
I’ve been doing road trips on those same highways my whole life so that’s one reason I really like these videos. I’ve seen those fucking the Thing signs 😂
Thanks a lot. You going on the cat in the hat ride triggered my ptsd.
30:31 "There's no earthly way of knowing, Which direction we are going, There's no knowing where we're rowing Or which way the river's flowing...."
please never do this again i don't want you to die
love the rainforest cafe cameos, keeps the rainforest spirit alive
Is this going to be a yearly thing? Because dear lord your sanity is gonna leave you, but it gives us so much entertainment.
I can't tell you how excited I was to get the notification for this video! 10/10 loved the video
So what restaurant will you guys be doing next year?
mainline China*
This is hands down my favorite type of video on Youtube right now, thanks Eddy for sharing such an experience 👏
The midway point of regret is always the most fascinating part of your endeavors Eddy. It shows the real human side to doing these silly things. If you had a "big corporate sponsor" we would certainly NOT get this level of insightful commitment. Good or bad, I can't wait til the next inevitable silly roadtrip video.
I didnt expect you two to go on an adventure like this again but im so glad you did, thank you for taking this journey and i look forward to your future endeavors after a well earned rest
Rip, your tummy.
i watchedthis video then immediately became violently sick from BOTH ends margaritaville is just that strong 🙏
they've done it again!
So…what are the margaritavilles in houston or Lafayette?😅
You missed the Margaritaville in Jacksonville, FL which is why i watched the video:( you gotta go back!!
holy what
now do it for a 3rd time
Margaritaville is just a diet version of Rainforest Cafe.   Bucees is an American version of IKEA
We need an every waterpark m in the dells video next
eddie you have to do another trip next year
Biloxi! Love it there. Lived down the road for 6 years
Did the guy you met also wear the same outfit? Kinda sus EDDY! If that's even your real name.
jimmy buffet is a stain on humanity
These videos are sooo stoooopid but some how im here til the end of every video 😂  I’m so glad I just found this channel. Keep up the cool, weird , and corky videos coming
Schlatt with the Yakult Swallows hat though
WE KNOW U DID 9/11 TED. WE FUCKING KNOW. and we
There are 36 (ish) Hard Rock Cafes in USA and Canada  Thera are 23 Bubba Gump Shrimps in USA and Canada.  While Bubba Gump has less locations, the 1 Canadian location is in Edmonton Alberta (waaaaayy farther north).  But Hard Rock has TWO Canadian locations with one in Niagara AND one in Coquitlam (near Vancouver) BC. There's also a Hard Rock in Seattle so that's kinda close??  Also Bubba Gump Shrimp for a month sounds like hell. If they do it again my bets Hard Rock
final road trip...
we take care of each other in Atlanta......most of the time.
You should do Dick's Last Resort chain.
The pain never ends
YALL MISSED A COUPLE 😂
You should do Senor Frog's next year.
YESSSS! Now do it next year with Bubba Gump Shrimp Company!!!🍤
I hope to God that this becomes a series
So next years trip is going to be whalburgers right? lol
10:03 rude
Next time - Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co
what made the last video work was the commentary and engagement between you and your friend. You just monologing it fun and engaging but i feel without clips of you and tend talking it feels like somethings was missing
Next step, McDonalds
how about every mcdonalds in the U.S
Yet again, another cinematic masterpiece.
So funny thing is they are building one in Ocean City MD so this isn't even going to be all of them
Round 3: Bubba Gump
Now do all the Bubba Gump’s 🦐
Why did I never realize Chrissy was the one who wrote the margaritaville song?! I don't even think of the original anymore, in my head that is THE margaritaaville song
PLEAASE COME TO THR BOSTON LOCATION WHEN IT OPENS LIKEEEE IM DYING FOR YALL TO COME TO MASSACHUSETTS!!!!! ❤
Going to the Times Square Margaritaville for my character arc too
this better not be the final time of this beautiful series
feet onlyfans when
Florida panhandle native here, wild to see my home turf Destin on here.
Another fucking banger from the king of bangers!
Y’all missed the Margaritaville in the lake of the ozarks! Fake video
Next time, no eating the same item twice
but why
As someone who has driven past those "The Thing?" ads a couple of times, I thank you for saving me this waste of time lmao
Jakey ❤❤❤❤
God I wish I were those dolphins 🤤
When you stare into the bean, the bean stares back.
Thank you for recognizing how terrifying the cat in the hat ride is
Brayden is the greatest reoccurring character in this series
Bubba Gump 2024!!!!!!!!
Awesome video but Biloxi is pronounced “ba-lux-e” with your best southern accent used lol again awesome video brother keep it up!!
the excitement that rushed theought my body when I saw this video in my feed is indescribable
or maybe its just bad hygiene at that Chicago location
Where are you going next year?
You forgot go to margaritasville in the lake of the Ozarks? Seems like it would have made for a great segway. Classic click bait.
"#1 on trending" wow
You missed the margaritaville in Palm Springs 😭
I think my sister was the manager at the Atlanta Margaritaville lol 😂 look at that
Next roadtrip: One-off theme parks. Get you back to Dollywood
You're officially a Parrot Head, Sir. Burback
OK Native here~! The one in Tulsa is owned and operated by the Muscogee Nation as part of River Spirit Casino. They usually pride themselves in providing a pretty good experience all around bc their regulars all live around there somewhere, so if it sucked no one would go lol And the Lucky Ducky, Ruby Red, and Mr Money Bags are all part of the OK Tribal Casino operations (more than one tribal nation~)
SUCH a strange question- can anyone tell me what pants/style of pants eddy is wearing @27:34 in the yikes shop promo pics. . .
I can't wait for them to go to every McDonalds in the country ❤
I guess you could say, this journey wasted you away
Legend has it, Eddy is still hungover to this day
Next you should go to every Chi-Chi's in the world.
THANK YOU 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How much do I have to pay for your feet
you forgot lulu’s in gulf shores alabama— restaurant of jimmy buffett’s sister lucy buffett
one margarita imma open my legs
As someone who has also stopped to see The Thing, I feel seen and validated
What else could be eaten this way?
There's a Margaritaville in Puerto Rico :)
Oh Eddy, you say final but we all know that's not happening
WE LOVE EDDY!
Looks like there is one coming to Boston...
I have no idea why this  was recommended to me or why I watched the entire thing, but I am glad it happened.
Bro mandella effected us. I feel like I have a vague memory of a slightly different version of this video haha
Eddy this video made me motion sick. I woke up this morning hoping to watch a good YouTube video before I started my long awaited homework, and to my surprise the video was an hour long. Yippee! A whole hour until homework. That's awesome. Nope.... The rainforest cafe video didn't make me nearly this motion sick and I don't think I can enjoy the rest of my day... Or the rest of my homework
I lived in the florida keys for over 2 3rds of my life and i can confidently  say all local restaursnts look just like that. Not just margaritaville, not just in key west, they all look like that. Very homey.   Also i consider it to be a sin that you went to key west and didnt order a seafood dish.
Now do every Bubba Gump's
Oh my god he’s done it again.
EDDY NO!
Why didn't you go to the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks Missouri?
I click on this video thinking 'you're really going to do this to yourself again?'
Was really moved by the use of chekhov’s jambalaya
Sad you didn't go to the High 5 Restaurant when you were in Austin. It was the restaurant that inspired Jimmy to write Margaritaville in the first place
Of course the restaurant was better in Canada, we do everything better
Waistin' away again it seems...
Dropping this on the same day as Barbieheimer is wild
Central New York never fails to disappoint
Hard rock cafe next year?
I just went to margaritaville for the first time in Tulsa, literally last weekend. It's a cool place!
Correction on the Biloxi location. The current location was a different casino that was destroyed by hurricane katrina. A couple developments have been tried there since then but all lost funding during recessions. The failed Margaritaville casino was in a different building a few blocks away. Also we will just look past how you pronounced Biloxi.
I love the cat and the hat ride as a kid.
Yo those nachos look tasty 51:00
nihilism vs idealism
Eddy is so brave fighting off TWO tummy aches just for our entertainment
I am very disappointed the Detroit Airpot Margaritaville did not make an appearance… shameful even.
Was that jshlatt?
met the same guy wearing the same shirt
YES ANOTHER ONE
now do every bubba gump
Didn't you learn your lesson dude?
I thought I was the king of Stinky Feet, but when I won it was against a 3 year old.
I'm sorry you had to come to Ohio
Absolutely love the energy of downing margs the night vefore and effect iit had the morning after. Also the Margariittaville in Atlanta really came in cltuch,  who knows what Jimmy would;ve done if you didnt complete this roadtrip
hardrock next
Bubba Gump Shrimp tour when?
Hehehe he's traumatized by the rain forest rain cafe
Can't wait until you go to all the Planet Hollywood locations. There are only six left.
Do cheese burger in paradise next
as a Minnesotan, I'm so sorry you had to hit MOA twice in your life hahaha thats like 2 more times than most of us here! I think there are 5 "Lids" hat stores in the mall, in case its like an emergency and you can't find one...edit: this is a masterpiece on par with Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take 1
Can't wait for your next year's road trip!!!
Isn’t the definition of psychosis doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results?
Can confirm those look exactly like the frozen Gorton's Beer Battered Fish Fillets I use them all the time for fish tacos lolll
YOU MISSED THE MARGARITAVILLE IN CAPITOLA, CA
So, Hard Rock Café next? 😁😁😁
In addition to every Hard Rock Café might I also suggest every Bubba Gump Shrimp?
I love the truly exhausted defeated look on eddy's face in the thumbnail
I used to live directly next to the vegas Margaritaville yall passed my old apt
Fucking lost it at "OH SHIT! The coolest motherfuckers on the planet".
#1 Trending!
Hard rock café -33 in Continental and Canada
Next summer TEXAS ROADHOUSE
Bubba gumps next year?
... Margheritaville is real? I just thought it was a blender
“I had jimmy fever”  EDDY NO 😭😭😭😭😭
Uh, SIR you missed the Margaritaville HOTEL in HOUSTON. tsk tsk tsk....
Number one hype man 47:11 😂
Fantastic video.
I hope this becomes an annual segment
Okay Eddy I know you said you were done but hear me out….  Hard Rock Cafe.  It would give you an excuse to go to Hawaii but also it’s a long flight 😂
I need you to do a "Every Guy Fiery restaurant in the country" tour!!!
I'm 30 minutes away from the resort in Biloxi, and people around here act like they're going to Disney when they talk about going to margaritaville
It really should be stressed for non-USA viewers just how batshit insane it is to drive cross-country across the United States, with the only thing you have to look forward to is a pit stop at Margaritaville.
You fucking beast
Im so glad someone understands my stance on the Dr Suess ride at Islands of Adventure
RIP Cheesburger in Paradise restaurant chain
Pidgeon forge threw me headfirst into an existential crisis when i was 16. Glad you boys made it out unscathed
My wife suggested Medival Times. Not as taxing, but just as weird
It took me a good five minutes to realize those markers on the map were margarita glasses and not, in fact, Samus Aran's helmet.
"I think it might be tinnitus" Felt with my own tinnitus ears lol. Also, first video and I'm already laughing my ass off.
I think we need to know more about Spencer!
The best part was Buddy.
Time for Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
The spencers joke was actually pretty funny
Finally someone who deserves the number one trending, bro congrats
love those guys
If I had a nickel for everytime two people decided to travel the entire US just to eat at a single restaurant chain, I’d have two nickels which is weird becuase it happened twice.
Hi Eddie. You missed the margaritaville resort at the Lake of the Ozarks
hasnt this already been done on youtube
"They're not people... they're Jimmy Buffet fans." - Yacht Rock (Web Series)
do every dicks last resort next
this is the greatest sequel in all of cinematic history
Maybe now you need to eat at every Ihop or every Cracker Barrel lmao. 💙💙💙
hopefully next year will be another chain.
Did this include Cheeseburger in Paradise franchises also?
Another banger
Dude you're such a Ted nivison copy. He did the same thing as you just hours ago. You also stole the idea of the rainforest cafe videos. At least try and hide it!!
Cool video. Next time do all Starbucks locations
Next year: Every Cheesecake Factory in the Country and you need to eat every variety of cake.
Seeing Syracuse NY and Destiny USA represented accurately as a mid place warmed my heart. I live near there and it’s not that great.
The Syracuse margaritaville is representative of Syracuse itself lol.
you can't keep letting Ted do this to you, Eddy.
for a second I was like "WTF, there's a MV in Niagara Falls??!" But you quickly put my worries to bed when I realized it was on the Canadian side. MV wouldn't survive one night in NF USA P.S. makes sense they would have good Buffalo Poutine too, regional styles sure saved MV!
pigeon forge is literally the exact same as branson missouri that is crazy
Ok Eddy, now do Bubba Gump Shrimp
I went to this restaurant growing up called Cheeseburger in Paradise. When you entered the first Margaritaville, I couldn’t help but notice the design and theme similarities between the two restaurants. I looked it up and turns out Jimmy Buffet’s company also opened a few Cheeseburger in Paradise locations. They’re all closed now but the legend lives on through Margaritaville 😪
Eddy you forgot the one in Sandusky Ohio
Very epic and cool.
amazing
Guess all you have left is Hard Rock Cafe. Be warned, the one in Philadelphia has cockroaches.
It is so weird seeing you go to pigeon forge and recognizing all the places you passed and the little attraction area called the Island.
as a clevelander, thank u for including tim misny
hard rock cafe. you know what must be done.
Eddie you forgot the Branson Missouri Margaritaville location
i learn so much every video, such as ted nivison did 9/11
Is this a reupload? I swear on god that I've seen this video before.
If you would’ve extended your stay in Destin and explored the Harbor Walk, I work right at Kitty Hawk Kites and would’ve given you my 40% off.
Hard Rock Cafe?
Every Hard Rock Cafe or every Bubba Gump Shrimp next??
Yay another video of Eddy’s I can rewatch over and over!!!
please do this again next year 🤣
That manager will not only get a good yelp review, but also the love and appreciation of thousands of dumb lil guys watching this video.
The sequel I didn’t know I needed 😂. If you ever want to make it a trilogy might I suggest Bubba Gump fit next year?
You should do Bubba Gump’s next year!
my family goes to the sc one EVERY year, ive also born to the destin one
Okay now do dicks last resort
“but even the bean couldn’t stop-my yummy from hurting” I BROKE ME SMALL INTESTINE NOW I CANT GET NUTRIENTS
“There not gonna force me to take a picture on my own right?” -Eddy Burback 2023
Up next, eating at every McDonald's in the US.
you should consider doing one of these but with bubba gumps next year
Eddy thanks for validating how much I cried on cat in the hat as a child, convinced the things were going to drop a piano on me
You missed the one in scenic Bossier City, Louisiana
Next up Hard Rock Cafe
Why?
tim misny billboard is a cleveland staple thank you for including it
You missed the one at the lake of the Ozarks in Missouri!!
I am still stuck on the part where Eddy is telling us why he would do this a second time. This is modern day Youtube flagellation. Ted can't be this good of company.  Edit: After watching this, I hope Eddy realizes this will be used against him if he ever murders Ted Nivison.
I’m not gonna lie, I’m watching this after smoking weed and the dinosaur alien museum is absolutely insane in the best way
#1 trending LETS GOOOO
well I’m from florida and I’m like what’s up danger
He’s doing it again, that mad lad!!
Can't wait for next year's Hard Rock Cafe  video
I love Teds preference of Tacomas over everything.
missed the one in the san juan airport smh
Love seeing your side of the trip after Teds unhinged side lol.  Btw, definitely go back to Dollywood, take Ted, film it all. Also go back down the strip and go to the Hatfield and McCoys Dinner Feud he talked about in his video because its hilarious and the food is good
I am British, those fish and chips are a travesty.
I clicked this video bc I used to work at the one at Orlando Universal and feel like parrot heads are definitely in a cult and the food is super mediocre and  i wanted to know how much you’d agree with me lol
So what's next? Every Hard Rock Cafe?
I want to go to there
margaritaville lake resort in the ozarks?? but great vid
I audibly gave out an "oh no" when you said you went on the Cat in the Hat ride. That ride is infamous for its terror
"I beat the child" -Edward Elmer Burbank, 2023
He has returned for his endless suffering beheld upon him.
Sooooo.... Bucca di Beppo journey?
Oh Eddy you fool! You should have said the continental US! You failed to see the Hawaii locations!  I guess there’s gonna have to be a part 2
Alright time for flavortown bud
As a Floridian, I can say that the Destin location is the better of the Margaritavilles. And the rain isn't a big deal until Waffle House closes. then it's a big deal
"I beat the child" - Eddy Burback 2023
must be weird to not have a basketball sized whole  on the passenger side seat in this tacoma for this road trip. Its the small things that matter.
as a person from georgia whos only regular vacation destination is PCB florida i feel like i shouldnt take it for granted ! florida looks so much funner than those other places lmao it really is so nice to walk off that beach and immediately be able to get lunch or dinner by walking. you dont have to get in the car or go back to your hotel you can just walk up the sidewalk. that being said ive eatin at every restaurant there BUT margaritaville and dicks last resort lol
To make it more worthwhile you just need to do more chains eddy
its so crazy that you guys did this again. im honestly amazed
You guys forgot the Margaritaville that's in the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
do bubba gumps shrimp next, i want to see you die from a combination of seafood and carsickness
dejavu is welcomed
52:00 this whole section is amazing also what music is that
What if 9/11.
When eddy said "one year later" i literally threw up in my mouth. the rainforest cafe road trip happened A YEAR AGO? it literally feels like it happened 6 months ago at an absolute maximum. the passage of time is horrifying. i'm dry heaving.
First, the Rainforest Rampage. Now, the Margarita Mayhem. Next, who knows?
see you next year for hard rock cafe!
You should do Hard Rock Cafe next, if you have it in you lol. Hard Rock is amazing, and the stuff inside the restaurant they have on display is sooo cool
Rip your stomach
Go to planet Hollywood next!!!
hard rock cafe next!!!! (too soon?)
Hard Rock cafes in 2024?
Nice, do Wendy's next!
Eddie and ted must be arch nemesises because as one grows stronger, the other grows weaker
Now do every buffet in the United States.
I started watching your videos and Ted's from the Rainforest Cafe video last year and am so glad you two decided to forge another trek. What a masterpiece this was.
You should eat at every Rigobertos Tacos in the USA and Canada next.  There are two and they're about 7 miles apart.
you missed the one in the u.s. virgin islands. it’s okay i went for you. it’s not good.
I hate to say this. But I think you missed one 😅
i feel obligated to say that sitting in my backyard is a Margaritaville cruiser bike with the quote "It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere!"
You guys should go to every 6 Flags.
Y’all skipped the Margaritaville in Bossier City LA . Its the only one that I went to
Visit every Bucc-ee's or every Hard Rock Cafe next!
And………. CANAAAADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Next year Eddy and Ted gotta visit every McDonalds in America
I like how these restaurants always have that one location in Canada, in frigging Niagara Falls
THE MISNY BILLBOARD!!!
You guys missed the one in Shreveport/Bossier, LA!
I’m reminded of the definition of insanity…
Air Force trauma off the river walk.
Another banger Eddy 🌟
Every midwesterner shuddered at the sight of this highway overpass 49:02
Can’t wait for the next one!
Bro i was literally at the mall in Nashville with the rainforest cafe and thought damn i should into that
As someone from Ohio you missed the true and original Margaritaville. Located in Margaretaville OH, there is another Margaritavile.
It could have been a normal, fun trip  Twice
Please do Hard Rock Cafes next
why would you do this again; this can't be good for your mental health
Can't wait for this series to get so out of hand that Eddy is eating at every Apple Bee's, or Olive Garden, or better yet McDonald's
the first margaritaville was gold some might even say premium
Hes searching for his lost shaker of salt
Can’t wait for next year.
I saw this in my recommended and had to do a double take to realize that, no, it wasn't just the Rainforest Cafe one being recommended again, *you actually pulled this shit a second time.*
Ok now do Bubba Gump Shrimp
Proud Canadian here, I love that both trips, Canada really represented well!
Can’t wait for next year and they stop at every buc-ees!
I’ve been going to PCB for years and seeing eddy go to the pier park was just so cool
“Final time” we’ll see
Can’t wait to see what next year will bring. What chain will it be?
Eddy, new idea:  Visit every Dick’s Sporting Goods in the USA. Call it the Dick Trip
This is an excellent sequel to Chrissy's Margaritaville song
I never thought Eddie was the taller brother
Twenty bucks for chili cheese guac nachos seems horribly overpriced.
My first words when I saw this pop up were ‘oh no, eddy why?’
Screaming into the void that they forgot the margaritaville in Missouri
Let this man rest omg
Nice, now do hard rock cafes
I love how many of the pictures are blurry - it really adds an extra layer of realism lol
Didnt visit Margaritaville Beach Resort in Cancún. The saga remains incomplete
Okay 2024: Eddy and Ted tackle every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company location…
I guess  Hard Rock cafe is next
OMG you were in Tulsa!!
This might be the best duology I have ever seen. The cameos, the premise, the messages, everything was perfect. If you did a third one of these, THIS would be the best one without a doubt. You sir have outdid yourself. More people should be impressed by you and your friend for taking the time and effort to struggle through entire FRANCHISES in the entire country. Well I care, and I say please for the LOVE OF GOD make a third one. It doesn't matter where you go I just wanna see another masterpiece at work. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you Eddy Burback. Thank you
Now go to every McDonalds in the country
I swear I'm actually concerned for eddys health at this point
Cant wait to see Bubba Gump next year
number 1 on trending babyyyyyy
Please go to gump shrimp to complete it
Loved the reference of the Tucker Carlson green m&m blade runner 2049 meme
Who loves cats here?
eddy not again
A close family friend was a complete Parrothead. She saw Jimmy Buffett in concert several times. She died a few years back, but it's funny seeing the Buffett mania again :) There's something kind of comforting about it
Ted and Busch conspired 9/11 together
Pee pee poo poo 🩷 (especially Binkley)
Didn't expect the thing in my jimmy buffet content but I will take it
Maybe I missed it, did he go to the one in Capitola, CA?
you're such a wholesome human being
I started my dream job the same week the rainforest cafe video drop, and I celebrated my one year anniversary with a new shitty restaurant roadtrip video, I don’t know if I want a yearly installment but it wouldn’t hurt me like it hurts eddy
are they seriously friends with schlatt though??🤢
Eddy go to Bubba Gump’s to complete a trilogy of dumb theme chain restaurants
Planet Hollywood next?
Honestly, I hope all the Margaritaville executives take the time to watch this!!
Looking forward to the Medieval Times or Dick's Last Resort video next year!
RIP Ed's colon, rest in pieces
Can't be disrespecting Syracuse Marg like that. I won't stand for it
You missed one in Louisiana :/ I was excited to see how shitty you thought bossier city was lol
Do it again or I unsubscribe
please tell me you stopped at the palm springs margaritaville
Yay! We get to watch Eddy suffer again!!
I have vague memories of going to one Margaritaville with my family as a kid. It's basically the same thing as the video.
They need to finish the trilogy with the 22 Bubba Gump Shrimps
and he did it again
I've got $10 now let me see dem toes ed boy
i love these videos man
47:12 that’s gotta feel amazing
As a born and raised Floridian, and as someone who currently lives in Hollywood, Florida, your entire experience in my state was INCREDIBLY ACCURATE and hilarious to watch. Bravo Eddy xD <3
Ok soooo Hard Rock Cafe next?!?! You can’t stop now. I love pointless roads with themed restaurants.
Eddy you're so CRAZYYYY for having a margarita in the morning!!!! Like omg be careful there cowboy!!!
Imagine them doing the T-Rex Cafe next year 😂
Do Subway next
I don't know if you have plans to do more of these novelty restaurant road trips but I suggest Bubba Gumps they are such a weird forest Gump themed restaurant
Not me being proud of my South Florida Margaritaville’s 🥲
I didnt want it to end
the medieval times video gonna go crazy
As a Floridian I am very happy you came to visit not only Miami but the keys as well.
i wish they had a buffet that they called the jimmy buffet
Hard Rock Cafe next year??
Very cool now let’s see every McDonald’s in America.
Can confirm -- there are many puddles in Texas.
Next Eddy will be going to every hard rock cafe  Also ted still wearing the rain forest shirt LOL
So City "Walk" is different from City "Wok"?
I got the worst food poisoning of my life after eating the fish and chips at the margaritaville in miami. So I was on the edge of my seat every time Eddy had a tummy ache. Very thrilling experience 10/10
Do every McDonald’s in America next year
Why do you hate yourself? 😂
WASTING AWAY AGAIN IN MARGARITAVILLE  LOOKING FOR MY LOST SUGAR AND SALT (SALT! SALT! SALT!)
Im pretty sure the hurricane was rotating the wrong way
"Final" time. There will be more.
I'm so happy that this road trip was better for him
YOu should do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurants next
At 24:41 is that a wild chicken in the street? Wtf? Can someone from florida help explain this please 🙏🏻
MY FACE IS LITERALLY 😆😆😆
Sucks bc Eddy and Ted are so close to local classics. Like PCB and the captains tale.
What about the Air Margaritavilles in various airports?
Once again just casually living my dreams
Damn, I thought I saw you in the Riverwalk 🥲
Tummy problems are from yes the diet. But also mixed with the driving.
46:30 I know them eyes. He MAKES THEM PAY
Oh no, Eddy is having a good time. Is Ted going to be suffering in his video?
So...Hard Rock Cafe? 😉
Eddy looks like a sad dog every time he sees the rainforest cafe
Number #1 trending video on youtube, fuckin' A Eddy.
next year has to be bucee's
RAX NEXT. you must.
next summer go to all the margaritavilles and rainforest cafes in the WORLD
You should do bubba gump shrimp next
I’ve never heard someone call Biloxi Biloxi. It’s the most non-southern way I’ve ever heard someone pronounce the name. Lol
I can’t wait for Teds side of this trip to come out where the whole bit is just a deathly hatred for Jimmy Buffet
I SEE JARVIS!!!!!!
All in favor of sponsoring their trip to Dollywood?
atlanta traffic fucking up a whole trip is exactly what it is like all the time
You guys should do every Hard Rock next year
So after see your video of your roadtrip last year me and a friend had been talking about doing this at some point but had it mapped out differently where we would end in Key West at the original one.
48:23 looks like an album cover
Next year: Me and Ted ate at every Golden Carrol in the country and Canada
I mean…now you have to go to every Dave and buster’s now…. Right?
Eddy: "I'm never doing this again" *one year later* Eddy: "I ate at every McDonald's in the world"
So Eddy, for your next restaurant you should do the bubba gump shrimp Co. Only 22 spots in the US.
So I hate to do this but there's a Margaritaville in Palm springs.
Please please please go to Dollywood, you won’t regret it. It’s so fun.
sorry...you're friends with...schlatt?
legend
I think he's forgetting the final boss of the resort/ cafe world, and it's none other than the HARD ROCK cafe
THE BOYS ARE BACK
Bubba Gump's Shrimp next???
47:11 is probably my fav part of this video. Literally the cutest thing ever!
This popped up when I opened YouTube and I said, out loud, “Oh, Eddy….you didn’t…”
Eddie sure knows how to personally torture himself on a level I previously didn’t know existed, and it’s an interesting, amazing thing to witness.  Eddie, we appreciate your dedication 🙏🏼🖤
Eddy your life expectancy is gonna be cut into half thanks to these
BTS stans in the year 2040 going to jiminville
Your lifestyle truly does determine your death style.
The sequel we didn’t know we needed
You butchered biloxi
I feel like he was really pulling off that hat with the matching tropical themed shirt.
There’s a margaritaville resort in Conroe, TX (random place) but it apprently doesn’t have a Margaritaville restaurant, which I find very weird!
Can't wait for the Hard Rock Cafe video in 2024.  :)
Liver failure the road trip
Next stop. All 34 Hard Rock Cafes in the US.
I've been to the casino/resort in Biloxi Mississippi and the "water park" at lake Lanier in Georgia and didn't even know that there was a Margaritaville restaurant.
Forgot Shreveport location, sorry but you gonna have to redo it
Next stop: Bubba Gump Hell
I would eat at every Margaritaville in the US and Canada to see a manatee eating lettuce
Do it again, I wasn't watching
Did he dis Buckee's?, angry comments from his southern fans commence.
The little Margaritaville map markers look like Samus Aran
I actually worked at one of the shops at the Island in Pigeon Forge at one time, where that Margaritaville is, for about a week and a half and pretty much having that, Mellow Mushroom, and Dick's Last Resort as your only options for food, since even trying to get something nearby in the 20 minute time window they gave us was impossible, honestly became a bitch and half real fast, and an expensive one at that.  BTW if u even have the sanity to do this again Dick's Last Resort and Bubba Gump would be 2 cool options
now do mcdondalds
can’t wait for next year when Ted and Eddy go to the every Hard Rock Cafe
you missed the one in jacksonville
now eat at every subway
But eddy, the one in Mexico!
Did you go to the Sandusky margaritaville, cause that's the only one I've ever been to.
My dog is named Margaritaville
As a person from Florida   The last couple of months have been bad, even with my Florida curve of knowing Summer is storm season. I’m glad y’all were safe.  For non-locals. Every day in summer, you can expect a violent thunder storm for 30-45 minutes in the midafternoon and doesn’t let up until September. If it rains more than that- it’s usually a mild tropical storm.
Seeing jakey in your vids is like seeing your long time ex best friend in a picture with your other friends :(
i thought stinky feet only existed in the tiny canadian amusement park outside my hometown but i guess not! wild
Next year you guys should go to every Burger King in the country
Keep bucees out of your mouth. Bucees is an institution. You could never understand. Also it’s pronounced bussies
I love how you mentioned Wisconsin Dells! I have many many memories as a kid and yes Top Secret is still only $5 today only.
The sequel we all needed.
Someone else said eddy should do medieval times next and I 100% support it
Legit had the Rainforest Cafe video in my watch later for months. Finally watched it yesterday only for this to come out today. Fantastic. I feel like doing this would actually be a blast, but I'm kinda glad I don't have to and I can just watch this instead. Great videos!  Sooo what's next? Hard Rock Cafe?
no way
This is HEROIC
This is art
You fucking what.
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT OF PEACE WHY IS JSLAUT HERE
I can't wait for next year's Bubba Gump video
Eternally disappointed that Jimmy Buffet would create a restaurant that is NOT a buffet
ill see you guys in a year when they go to all the rainforest cafes and margaritavilles back to back
there are 25 hard rock cafes in the US........
Eddy sure does make a lot of videos talking about guys named Jimmy
I couldn't tell, did you go to the Air Margaritavilles like in Miami airport?
so are you doing Bubba Gumps next year??
Interesting, it seems like in the US the decor, aesthetic and vibes of the restaurant matters more than the food quality
My prediction before watching is that the food’s gonna go down a lot smoother than all the rainforest burgers and safari fries
See you next year!
You should do every McDonalds in the country for the grand finale of the series
Seeing Eddy get on the Pigeon Forge Ferris wheel is worth this entire video
cant wait for smosh to do a funeral and tell me how badly this affected the environment
Next year is middeval times okay eddie?
Did you get a chance try a margarita
tummy ache survivor fr
You did it, Eddy, almost.  Alas, your journey is not yet complete.  There is one final boss...  The Margaritaville on St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.
I didn't know they made the South Park thing into a restaurant
WHY would you rent ANOTHER truck? Lol I feel like literally any other vehicle would of been more sensible.
The worst part was you had to come to Atlantic city a second time
I ate at every Margaritaville or; How eddy learned to stop worrying and love Rainforest Cafe
Next up... Every Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory!!!
hard rock cafe next year?
as a mississippi native who one of her go to ms fun facts for her college friends is "did you know jimmy buffet's from pascagoula" thank u for ur service
Jeddy Buffback
Can't wait for the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. adventure next year
46:50 Hey, it's on the river in Cleveland! You just had to turn around! Goof ball --- I've never been to eat there through, sorry you had a bad time
so happy that someone has made the public aware of the horrors found in the cat in the hat ride
53:56 from left to right we have Herbert P. Bear from Club Penguin, Scrooge McDuck, and Jessica Rabbit
I just ate at the syracuse location and the manager yelled at me. But I got my booze in a blender so its a-okay.
So Hard Rock Cafe next?
Bubba Gump tour 2024
When I first saw this thumbnail my brain was just, "Oh, I'm being recommended the Rainforest Cafe video again. That's neat."  And it will never stop boggling my mind that an upbeat tragic song is the name they chose for the chain. I guess it's recognizable, but goddamn that's what they went with.
The rainforest cafe still haunts you...
@caitlyraee
You should go to every Bass Pro Shops in the country
This was a great video. Can’t wait for next year’s “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country”
When I saw the title in my recommended, I thought it was just the Rainforest Cafe video again, but seeing it was a different restaurant this time I was like "EDDY. You don't gotta do this to yourself, man."
James Boofay would be so proud!
The sequel i didnt know i needed, a story i'll never forget. Thank you eddy
upset he didnt go to the st thomas location
do bubba gump shrimp co. next :D
Next hit every Hard Rock Cafe in the world.
Let’s see Hard Rock Cafe next year!  Another trip to Niagara Falls Canada!
I live not that far away from Mall of America and have to go there all of the time to catch my bus to go to work, so how he looked and felt at moa looked a lot lile how I feel going there all the time! I think the only time I have actual fun there is I'm going there with a friend or my dad sometimes.... Edit - its the next day and I discovered that my pokemon go game wants me to go to the Margeritaville Chair at Mall of America for a Pokestop 😂. I don't know if it was there yesterday because I wasn't paying much attention to it. I just found it really funny that the day after I watch this video my Pokémon Go game is like time to go visit the Margeritaville Chair! Lol
Do another
11 days in and I want to quit. I can see how taxing this is
Lol the Thing has really good burgers at DQ though
Hey, HE'S BEEN TOURING THE US SINCE THE 1980's!   GET BACK ON THE ROAD!   In the motivational words of J Buff's himself to get you going:  “It takes no more time to see the good side of life than the bad”.... PLUS no more monkeys above the urinals.
Loved this video! Just everything about it was amazing! Subscribed, and props for the dedication
Next should be every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country. There are 22 in the US.
This is my proposal to have this challenge redone as y’all did not swim to the margaritaville in Nassau, I know it’s not in America but it basically is…
I'm stoned rn and the bit at 52 mins really freaked me out. Nice video btw,
next year go to every Hard Rock Cafe
So this is where you’ve been
I hope the supporters get to see the video with the feet in it
When will Eddy and Ted go to every McDonald’s
Soo… Hard Rock Cafe next year?
It's like they feed off the negative energy of the other one. Amazing to see.
Biloxi is pronounced bill-UCK-zee Eddie! Bill-UCK-zee.
I got too damn giddy about Eddy mentioning the Wisconsin Dells. I went there a lot too as a kid lol
This is your brand now, I expect a third installment next year
My dude just figured out probably one of the best "business expenses" ever.
hhhhhhhhh
I rewatched the Rainforest video quite recently thinking to myself: “This is so fun to watch, but clearly also a torturous experience for the guy, he leaned his lesson the hard way.”  AND THEN HE UPLOADED THIS
I enjoyed this more than I could ever truly express and now I am conflicted. On the one hand, seeing you in such misery makes me glad it‘s finally over, but on the other hand, I‘d LOVE to be back in a year watching you two visit like… idk… every Bubba gump Shrimp Company in the US because third time‘s the charm
A truck? for a long road trip... Why? lol Maybe an suv... or a wagon or even a midsized sedan... would have saved a lot on fuel and been able to safely store your valuables... lol I am so confused
Eddy what if I pay you can I see your lil piggies
Why did he skip Jacksonville??? Went right by it.
Margaritaville is the most expensive way to be an alchoholic
The real boss challenge would be to do a road trip to every McDonalds in the country
Justin McElroy needs to see this
i'm glad you're saying this is the last one otherwise i have a feeling that after the next weird chain restaurant you would get an IBS diagnosis
rip to the margaritaville in glendale az that they closed 😞
Didnt get key lime  pie at the  florida keys??? Crazy !
Pleaseeee go to dollywood its so fun
Gotta make this is a series now. Do Cheeseburger in Paradise or Joes Crab Shack next
you forgot the margaritaville resort in shreveport louisiana , eddy
There is one restaurant I have sworn off in my entire life and it is Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. The way you feel about Rainforest Cafe is the way I feel about Margaritaville. Thank you for doing me this service and giving me exposure therapy/closure on the worst dining experience of my life <3
If you wanna learn more about the cult of buffet   https://youtu.be/ZRN9tF7DyOU
I look forward to the nationwide Bubba Gump Shrimp trip
You guys should do bubba gump’s next
If you didn’t do the cruise I’m gonna be sad.
Cant wait for next years trip!
Ok now go to every mcdonalds in the world
Did the one in Shreveport close??
I hate to be the unfortunate bearer of bad news, but you missed the one in Bossier City Louisiana.
DAMN EDDY IS LOOKING HOT AS FUCK!!!
Next year can you please please please eat at every Joe’s Crab Shack? I’m begging 🙏
Awww shit, here we go again
tim misny rep 💪 ohio icon
The sequel I didn't know we needed
wait till the McElroy brothers see this
You missed the one in Jacksonville FL :(
10:13 IT'S NOT A RIVER IT'S A CREEK
why
The Myrtle Beach one has Hurricane storms every hour just like Rainforest Cafe's thunderstorms. I'm a little sad he didn't mention it
My  4 year old got excited because she thought the two of you was a live action mario and Luigi and now i cant unsee it
seeing u love the pcb location makes my heart happy that restaurant is a part of my CHILDHOOD
I may have been a year late to the Rainforest Cafe video, but I am on time for this one
You missed the Margaritaville in South Padre Island in south Texas!
I live in Arizona and “The Thing” gets it theme changed once every few years. 😂
this should be a speedrun category
2 times is a trend now you gotta do it again your the food road trip guy now
the Bean is like 5 minutes from a legit beach! you could have cooled your toes in the frigid waters of Lake Michigan. It's what Tony would have done.
What about the Margaritaville at Lake Lanier in Georgia?
Next year it’ll be bubba gump’s
I legit expected Jimmy B to show up in person at some point in the video but like as a joke like they didn't recognize him.
35:30 respect to those guys for being champs/willing to play along
I'm so glad
You forgot one. Margaritaville at sea. The cruise ship
Can't wait for the next video where he eats at every bubba Gump shrimp company
If i had a nickel for every time eddy has given a major corporation hundreds of dollars and ate at all of their locations in the us and canada id have 2 nickels. Which isnt alot bit it sure is weird its happened twice
I wanna suckle dem tootsies!
Eddy please take a chance and record a video in Dollywood I bet it would be incredible
47:11 was so wholesome lmfao
Next: going to every Chuck E. Cheese
You can tell a video did well when despite nearly going insane, they do it again a year later.
Ted and Eddy are the Mario and Luigi of YouTube
You missed Conroe tx margaritavile
Now you two gotta go to every Bubba Gump shrimp location
So this is what you've been up to
The Deep Eddy distillery is outside of Austin. You should make a trip.
Can't wait for the caravan renovation vids for more driving coast to coast unwillingly
back at it again with the self-harm.
Does it count if you don’t go to the Margaritaville in Bossier City, Louisiana?
can you do cracker barrel next
EDDY NOOO!!! 😂
We had a margaritaville for a little while, but it was not well received. It opened and closed so fast I only went there once and was not impressed with the food at all.
Go to every six flags
I await the madness that Bubba Gump's would bring. Do it for all of us.
eddy burback coming to syracuse and taking a video of my route to work
I shuddered when they showed up at DestiNY.
wonder where he is going to eat next year lol
I think this is my first comment on your channel, I have got to say that this was very entertaining to watch and you are a very good creator
Just call this series "Making an excuse to hang out with my best friend Ted" and who could blame him.
Now do McDonald’s
i just realized he skipped the one I know (uncasville CT) and it's in a casino (mohegan sun) and not listed on the margaritaville site.  there could be even more margaritavilles yet undiscovered...
i can’t even fathom the conversations they had in that car
The way you two were so in sync saying no to the border patrol lady at Niagara Falls was beautiful 10/10
I pray this becomes a yearly tradition
Now do Hard Rock Cafe: there are 34 locations
i hate to be that guy... but why though???
eddy slowly being indoctrinated into the jimmy buffet cult is such a mood
As a fellow Chicago native;   WHY THE BEAN??
Wait until the one in Boston opens
When I was 4/5 (i don’t quite remember) I moved from San Antonio to San Diego and my parents also fell for the “Come see The Thing” trap. 8:32
I’ve been to the keywest margarita ville. It’s pretty good.
Gabe: “I’m not leaving with you. I was doing my margaresearch, and found a place here called Margaritaville. I’m gonna live there from now on.”  Tycho: “It’s not a city, it’s a chain restaurant. They will throw you out once they close.”  Gabe: “They are allowed to try.”
The absolute legend! He does it again. Can't wait for next year's restaurant road trip.
Bro
Please stop coming to Nashville without my permission
47:12 whoever yelled that is such a bro
Can't wait for next year's trip to every Bubba Gump
Eddy, after watching this I have many words I could say. BUT I think they can all be summarized into one phrase by the man himself.   “Waistin’ away again in Margaritavile”
I bet one of the staff recognized eddy and told the manager they HAD to let them in
You guys are doing hard rock cafes next year, right?
restaurant boy back at it again
"Final" roadtrip. Thank you for your service gentleman. I'm gonna miss this series of videos until your video next year where you go to all the Cheesecake Factories in the US (and Canada)
46:32  You found Misny! Genuinely happy to see that guy’s goofy mug in this video. Idk a thing about the guy or his law firm but his billboards are undeniably Ohio.
what the fuck eddy
I’m so glad you met up with Danny in Florida and saw Drew in Chicago!!
nakob jakob
Why do these videos feel like they were made in the early 2000s. In a good way
Ok well I will look forward to the hard rock cafe tour next year.
I dont expect people to pronounce city names that arent rlly popular right first try, but the amount of times he pronounced Biloxi wrong 😭😭
mahgarita
i'm only thirty seconds into this video and already losing my mind because after the rainforest cafe video dropped i told my younger brother "we should do that but with margaritaville". i'm a chicago transplant/myrtle beach native and the myrtle beach margaritaville is hallowed ground -- i've described it to more than one person as a "hallucinogenic hunter s thompson fever nightmare". i hope you were able to appreciate just how batshit insane the whole operation is
Ok but when will we see "I ate at every Chuck E Cheese in the Country"?
I didn't think you could ever top your Rain Forest Cafe video, but here is proof! Thank you for this video!!!!
There’s a margaritavill in Capitola ca, he missed one
cant weight for the next trip
Now do all the Bubba Gumps
real
the thing was such effective marketing i’m seriously questioning how people wouldn’t stop especially on road trips
Damn you skipped Jacksonville Florida ??????!!!!!!
Rainforest cafe was the crucifixion and margaritaville was the rebirth.
Oh what's super funny is the Cat In The Hat ride used to be super intense. It now runs at like 1/4th or 1/8th speed, so it used to be a real trip. 🤮
Someday someone has to visit all the Bubba Gump Shrimp locations
I actually worked at one of these locations. The GM was a huge dick.
Time to eat at every McDonald's
Do all McDonald’s next
Do McDonald's next!
Next do Bubba Gump's
Next summer yall should do bubba gump
He did this for me
Ted must be a fucking paranormal entity that feeds off of misery and despair. There's something behind that smile
Can't wait for next year when you do all of the Hard Rock Cafe's!
I have never heard of margaritaville but now I want to go
Cant wait till next year when you eat at every bubba gump restaurant
As someone who was raised by Parrotheads and who grew up on Jimmy buffet music, it’s cool to see you react to the insanity of it all lol
To wrap it all up is now you have go on the jimmy buffet cruise
The final trip until next year when you hit all the Bubba Gump Shrimps.
So what's next? Bubba Gump?
#1 tummy ache survivor! so proud of you!
Why stop the video series here? Next up: every McDonald’s in america
How many Margaritavilles do you have to eat at before your bank calls you?
Hey eddy I watched your video first please let ted know :)
So next yeah they're doing Cheba huts right?
Every McDonalds in the country or I'm not paying for feet.
Can't wait for next year's 38-stop Hard Rock Cafe North America tour! If you want a proper Perfect Margarita (which is a specific type of margarita, like a Tommy's Margarita) use 2oz of a good blanco tequila like Tapatío, 1.5oz fresh squeezed lime juice, .5oz good triple sec like Cointreau, and 2 dashes Angostura bitters. Salted rim on the glass is optional but you can also add a small pinch of salt to your cocktail shaker which is my preferred method. Strain into a chilled coupe glass and you've got yourself one of the best tequila cocktails to ever exist.
Random question, whats the name of the song at the 3:11 mark??
Hard Rock Cafe.... I dare you
putting vivaldi over the margaritaville song explaination *chef kiss*
You missed Shreveport, LA! It’s also a casino!
You need to do Hard Rock Cafe next!
I totally forgot there was a Margaritaville in Destin, though I did recognize the boat "The Buccaneer".
Do Hard Rock Cafe next. Including international locations 😂
I am oddly intrigued by you and this concept thanks for coming to the one in my hometown! I love their sweet tea at margaritaville. Bussin
If you guys did this again you could do Bubba Gump Shrimp company. The main issue with those restaurants are the fact that most of the locations are in California and Florida with a few in Texas mixed with a couple spread out in some cities in the country. Plus one in Edmonton.
If Jimmy Buffett passes after this video comes out, it will be both the greatest of tragedies and coincidences.  Edit 9/05: Dammit! I hate it when I’m right. RIP
yo whats the music at 48:31
You mad lad. You've done it again, and you did it all for us.
The Manatee eating lettuce is easily the highlight of this entire video.
Next time? Eat at every. single. McDonald's. In the world.
Great video Eddy! Can't wait for the Bubba Gump video next year :)
I never thought I’d see a video like this again but I’m so glad I did. Thanks for doing what no one else could. Hard Rock Cafe next year? (haha jk…unless??)
eddy im so sorry. atlanta traffic is always like that
What's next? Hard Rock Cafes?
Eddy is sacrificing himself for our entertainment and i love to watch it
“I beat the child” we know you started playing better when that kid picked up the gun just for competition!!
I think you missed a margaritaville in Missouri
I have such fond memories of the San Antonia River walk. I would visit with my family pretty much every summer for 12 years before moving up north. I miss those times.
Eddy did.. did you miss the Jacksonville beach Margaritaville?!?!
What's next?  Every Dennys in the country?
"Why would me make another one of these videos?" **looks at most watched video on channel** HMMMM..... I can't guess why he'd do this.
Now do every Hard Rock Cafe. All 165. I believe in you.
Misny makes 'em pay! Welcome to Ohio 😂😂
Will subscribe when eddy goes to every bucees
18:20 it is SO strange to see this place from my childhood discussed in a video like a million people are gonna see. like, yeah that's pier park! they have a little train! and an ice cream store my cousin worked at once! and it used to have the remnants of the Miracle Strip! and there it is... with eddy
can’t wait to see another themed chain restaurant road trip in a year
So?
Why do i feel a weird sense of pride that the Atlanta store did that favor for you lmao 😭 i remember going to lake lanier all the time in middle school, but we stopped going JUST before margaritaville took over. Glad to see its not all that bad lmao
i know this is an unfortunate request but this should be a series
Am I crazy or isn’t there a Margaritaville in Atlantic City New Jersey?!
i cant wait for them to do medieval times, i think it'll kill them fr
You guys should do every HOOTERS in the country (and us in Canada pls)
i hope you guys go to hard rock cafe next
Can’t wait for the medieval times video to end the trilogy
I don't know where Ima gonna go when the volcano blow...but I know where to go when eddy and ted drop new vids 🙌🏻
the only logical finale to this series is Hard Rock Cafe…
do hard rock cafes next.
Ted wearing a "The Thing" t-shirt from Arizona in Nashville  is such a good addition to the continuity of the video thank you
😂😂😂 i love these videos!!!💯👍👍 they bring me so much happiness and joy!! Thanks Eddy!!😅
Some people claim there's a woman to blame, but Eddy knows it's his own damn fault.
Imagine if he had chosen the Hard Rock Cafe
What other restaurants can they do?!
So next year, you complete the trilogy? Medieval Times only has 10 locations, Bubba Gump Shrimp might be doable, but it has a good amount of locations. I'm sure there's another themed chain out there just aching for you to do a tour.
I’m gonna need y’all to go to every Medieval Times
You should go to every McDonald's in the country
bubba gump shrimp next?
cant wait for next years road trip
Next road trip vlog should be visiting every single McDonald's in the country
Shitty Jimmy Buffet music makes my stomach sick also.
Eddy.. You missed the Miami Airport Margaritaville...
The fact that I just rewatched both you and Ted’s videos going to all the Rainforest Cafe’s like yesterday and yall just uploaded this today is phenomenal.  Ty for your brave sacrifice Eddy 🤣
Man that manager who came in clutch probably got the best tip she’s gotten in years. 😂
not the syracuse mall :/
Maybe the real Margaritaville was the indigestion we got along the way.
Ok next I need every Applebee's ever
Haven't even finished watching, but I know a legend when I see one.
52:49 "You look lonely... I can fix that."
The first time I went to the Mall of America Margaritaville was also the last. I had the Jambalaya and it was, truly, awful. It's been 6 years or something.
20:18 I just got played.
Never could I have imagined Blade Runner 2049's "You Look Lonely" scene could be replicated wordlessly in the Mall of the America with the Green M&M, but by golly, you did it. A triumph of gonzo documentary food travelogue.
And if next year you do a Bubba Gump Sprimp tour, there is also one right next to the Rainforest Cafe and the Margaritaville in the Mall of America
the atlanta traffic is a guarantee
Eddy doing the God's work that no other mortal man would ever do, first it was Morbius, then it was Rainforest Cafe, and now Margirtaville.
I’m here for it. Never been to a margarita ville tho. I got to eat at a rainforest cafe once as a kid and I’m leaving it in nostalgia bc I want it to remain special.
Can’t wait for eddy and ted eat at every bubba gumps
If this doesn’t win Best Documentary at the next Oscar’s, I’m rioting.
Hard Rock Cafe 🤘
I just started the vid -but rainforest cafe is probably my favorite youtube video ever posted so I can't describe my excitement when seeing this posted
10:24 jumpscare
Those Margaritavilles without Jimmy are a CRIME!
Buddy is a perfect name for that dog tbh because every time a stranger's dog wanders up to me and is super friendly I'm like "awww, hey buddy!"
Okay im so curious for answer: does the Margaritaville in Shreveport, LA, not count???????
So Canada just has better food
As a fellow Mississippian who lives near Margaritaville, the burping volcano made me feel seen <333 thank you eddy
now go to every hooters
So.....next year, Hard Rock Cafe?
Every hard rock café next year?
36:07 I was on this highway the other day.
What a Rollercoaster of emotions!
Next this guy is going to go to all the Bubba Gump's in the world...
You missed Margaritaville Lake Conroe, north of Houston. So you didn’t hit them all!!!
i was traumatized by the margaritaville hurricane when i was like 4. i remember being petrified because it was raining outside the restaurant too and i thought it was spreading
The endurance, the perseverance, the commitment. Amazing
If you end up doing this again, Hard Rock Cafe could be fun?
I went to America at the beginning on this year and I saw a rainforest cafe and was like... Eddy was here
THE BEST OF YOUTUBE.  thank you for your service eddy
Nah mate! Now you gotta do Hard Rock  Cafe.
hope he sees this king
their callin that jambalaya? it looks like a weird too much rice gumbo
Next he's gonna do Planet Hollywood,  I can already see it now.
I only have one question... WHY?
We love to see a tulsa W lol
Next you must go to every bubba grumps or see thing lol. Or Hard Rock Cafe.
Oh my god! 20:15 I thought that street looked familiar and sure enough, it’s PGA Blvd! That’s my hometown :)
It's like a roller coaster. Every morning he's hungover and every night he's having a blast. 🤣 Sounds almost like an alcoholic.
Seeing Eddie and Ted's videos pop up on my feed felt like I got directly hit by a semi truck, but a psychic had told me about it years ago so I should've expected it-
CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU DO NEXT YEAR
I would love to know how much the food would affect you "intestinally" without the addition of alcohol.
every dicks last resort
Y’all missed the one in Bossier City, Louisiana
I thought you skipped my local one but it turns out it was "rebranded" as of June 1st! You would've had 3 in 3 hours! 😂  And as a native Floridian, no the rain has been wild this year. Out of control storms almost every day recently. Like dangerous amounts of downfall.
Did you learn nothing?
NO TED DIDNT DO 911!                  Schlatt doesnt have an alibi for those planes he hijacked on that day going to those two towers though
Weird that jimmy made you feel like that but not your girlfriend but okay
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp next year!!
Those bank statements gotta look wild
Also, we are all going to be super nice if we go to that one location that hooked them up after they closed the kitchen,  right?
Can't wait for "I visited every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada" to hit my recommended videos in 2024.
Next year: every McDonald’s
The Cat in The Hat is my favorite ride at Universal Orlando 😭
28:22 Cat In The Hat was the first ride i ever got on as a kid, and yes it freaked me and my brother out
Can't wait for 2024 to watch "I ate at every Planet Hollywood in the Country"
But what about the Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri Eddy????? Is Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at Lake of the Ozarks not good enough for you Eddy?????
I thought the ‘What If’ museum was a fever dream I had on the way to Arizona. From the outside you truly have no idea what to expect and once they have your money you just have to be cool with it lol
The cycle begins anew...
actually I'm from Florida and the rain isn't even that bad
Next year Bubba Gumps?
these videos are starting to give me an existential crisis eddy
You are a madman
Very cool!
MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT GOING ON THE 2 DAY MARGARITAVILLE CRUISE!!!!
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
So glad you were able to find the joy in jimmy's way of life. We should all be more like Jimmy. #WWJD
I'm from Florida and driving in rain fucking sucks. No one knows how to fucking handle it, people drive around with their hazards on which is illegal and when you can't fucking see the other lanes to see if it's safe to change lanes it's distressing that some people are out here with fake turn signals on that you can't see "oh it's hazards" until you've already slowed down for them to get over--OH they don't need to fuck me for trying to be considerate I guess. Do you have hazards on because you think I don't know it's raining? Anyway, love you Eddy and Ted.
52:50 "you look lonely"
Eddy, think about the cholesterol, think about the toxins...
The absolute madman
Awesome video! Now do every Medieval Times
11:55 speaking as a Brit, calling that fish and chips is a hate crime
this video indicates eddy's predisposition to joining a cult
53:00 "You look like a good Eddy."
I would love to be able to do something like this. Just to say I had…
I feel like you need to visit every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada next
Mom, he's doing it again. 🙄🙄🙄
H A I L  B U F F E T
Has anyone ever told Ted that he kinda looks like the brother of the main character from Burn Notice?
the margarita might be alright but their havanas and bananas dink is amazing
Fun fact Jimmy Buffet graduated from my college, and used to play a show there every year until they said he couldn't drink and he stopped coming :)
Cant wait till next year lol
Bubba Gump Shrimp road trip next year?
“I think it might be tinnitus”
That kid who rolled up to play that foot fetish game either a) wanted to play free game or b) has some amazing comedic skills
I don't have a Twitter account someone send this to Justin McElroy asap
Eddie: "our second and FINAL roadtrip" Eddie next year: "I WENT TO EVERY TEXAS ROADHOUSE IN THE US"
What about all 23 Bubba Gump Shrimp Company locations in the US?
we gotta make ‘em do hard rock next. 2024 resolution babyy
Oh Christ Eddy. I can’t believe you did again. You’re locked not this now. Can’t wait for “I went to every chuck e cheese in America.”
Can't wait for 2024 when eddy eats at every Bubba Gump shrimp Co in the country (and Canada)
Not even the writers and actors going on strike could prevent us from getting the sequel we desperately needed.
When’s the Hard Rock Cafe adventure
I like that you two are like 7 years younger than me but look 7 years older than me it makes me feel good about myself
Do a casa bonita video
I live in NM and have always wondered what THE THING was. Glad I know now :|
Buc-ees is a cult worshipping an evil beaver who knows all your sins.
Great video! but the River Spirit casino in Tulsa is owned by the Muscogee Nation
You have to go to all the Hard rock cafes next year Eddy
Why did you do this to yourself, Eddy?
I can’t wait to come back to this for my nite nite film
You guys should do all Chuck E Cheeses in California and Every Hard Rock Cafe in the US
Do cheesecake factory next year
the sequel we didn’t know we needed 🤩
JB's appearance on JE's flite log is too disturbing to ignore.
you forgot the one in santa cruz bro
The feeling I had when ted was slipping into the abyss while eddy enjoyed himself was amazing, pure revenge and karma
Great. Now do the Hard Rock Cafe
I was about to feel like the biggest asshole by pointing out you didn’t stop at the Margaritaville in Osage Beach, Missouri…. but turns out I don’t think they have the actual restaurant on the resort for some reason lol
he missed a margaritville location near me in pensacola im js
I’ve never been so happy to see a video in my feed I can’t wait to watch both yours and Teds video! ❤😊
Who’s here from Ted’s vid and psyched to see Eddy’s perspective? 🙌
eddy's character development that started with indifference towards jimmy and ended in the complete opposite was very inspiring to watch
Who is going to tell this guy about the Margaritaville cruise ship?
HE DID IT AGAIN
He says that this is the last road trip until he goes to every single Hard Rock Cafe next year
Deep eddy is pretty decent 😂😂😂
Next summer, please do every Medieval Times!! There are 10 locations spread out across the US and Canada and you would LOVE IT
Eddy is going to make BANK with this finance ad!!! Perfect ad for this dope video!!
never been to margaritaville, but we *did* have a place called cheeseburger in paradise here around KCK. idk if that was an offshoot of margaritaville or not, but i *do* know the band let 4 year old me play w the drums after the show. so that was dope.  its long gone now but i wish i went there at an age i could remember.
Come on Eddy, Ted probably wanted to be positive to boost your spirits! Don't kill him for he only wanted to end the trip on good spirits! I must say when you do these cross country videos it's pretty wild, but I love them.
hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah this is the type of video i crave
A masterpiece
Brooooo you were with jakerton omg I love jake soooo much
River Spirit in Tulsa is owned by the Muscogee Creek nation. They just license Margaritaville lol
Should have flown to Minnesota, rented a tacoma and drove the trip in reverse, catching that Oklahoma 1 around Texas. Would have had the later stretch on the beach and skipped a 10 hour drive around day 20.
To complete the trilogy, you must go to all 34 Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaraunts in the continental United States
The Margaritaville in Biloxi is obsessed with Jimmy Buffet is was the same way in the old one
BRO I LIVE IN BILOXI, I DROVE PAST YOU GUYS, I HAD A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT AND DROVE PAST YOU. BRO.
Jimmy Buffett needs to know about this lol
Please do another one!
average miami local
I don't mean to be THAT guy, and maybe I missed something along the course of this video that clarifies this, but I'm pretty sure there's a Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio, like 10 minutes from Cedar Point that was not mentioned in the video? I go to it frequently, and I just wanna make sure it wasn't skipped or forgotten since it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area
always put a smile on my face seeing wittle ol Jakey
We had a Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant here in Indianapolis…. It was Not Good
And they say lightning never strikes twice.
Next year I want a video of Eddy and Ted traveling around the country going to all of the fun attractions they had to skip going to Rainforest Cafes and Margaritavilles.
do señor frogs next :v
"For the second and Final time." He says, we all know every great journey needs a Trilogy
my vote is American Girl Cafes next
Eddy needs to go to the Boston one when it opens
52:53 my favorite blade runner scene
You came to Pigeon Forge and DIDN'T go to Dollywood?! It's literal heaven though
Straight guys see dildos and it's a traumatic event
So... Hard Rock Cafe next year?
45:36 This is my reminder to go back to Canada for margaritaville.  It’s only 30 minutes away from me
The most important sequel we didn't know we needed
If I had a nickel for every time a youtuber drove across the country to eat at every themed chain restaurant in the country, I'd have 2 nickels. Which isn't a lot, but weird that it happened twice
If you do it again you should do the hard rock cafe chains lol
This video was made with AI
Next year you two should visit every Hard Rock Cafe in the United States and Canada. They have a unique pin design at each location relating to the area.  Very fun to collect (I have 23 so far)
You skipped Jacksonville dude
your videos have truly become incredible
Breathe in, breathe out is from Bush, btw.  Great song
now do mcdonalds
My man came all the way to Cleveland and went down by the waterfront to go to Margaritaville. Yikes. There are so many better places to be down there for those prices.  Love the Misny billboard making the video, though. Lmao.
Okay that’s it, time to go to every Chili’s in the USA Eddy. It’s what the people want.
YIPPEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Eddy, if this happens a third time we're going to have to stage an intervention; this is not healthy and we just want you to be Happy, Healthy and Safe (in the least parasocial way possible).
mad. lad.
How did you not go to the margarita ville lake resort at lake conroe.
How am I supposed to choose between yours and Ted's video. Now I have to watch both. You bastards.
As an ambassador of Biloxi Mississippi I must tell you locals pronounce it "Buh-luck-see" as opposed to "Bih-lock-see"
if you guys decide to tackle the challenge of eating at every Hard Rock Cafe, as someone who ate it almost every night for 3 months i will say it's not the worst dinner to subsist on for a long period of time (and i mostly cycled through the same 2 or 3 meals lol)
yeah i’m gonna watch this one i think
Bro you did this AGAIN?!! 😭😂😂 awesome though thank you for your strength for the spicy content 👍🏻
Jimmy Buffet musta made a deal with a devil to live forever as long as his name is remembered
At 49:20 when they're arguing in the car I believe they're stopped at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin. I could tell because Ive gone past there quite frequently and the rock formation gave it away along with the mile marker at 49:10.
Can’t wait for next years “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe” video!
pp
ok do macdonald's next
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
you missed the margaritaville in auburndale, fl
Thank you for your sacrifice, I needed this today.
for an even longer trip, go eat at every Hardrock Cafe in the country
now go to every mcdonalds
Hard Rock Cafe next
I guess you could say they were… wasting away in margaritaville
I really, really wish there were more Margaritavilles because this was way too short.
45:39 it’s crazy how thorough they were at the boarder! I’ve been a few times and they just said hi and bye 😂
"I am the king of stinky feet" -Dan Schneider
5:14 it's always, just in case his royal marg-ness comes in and wants to play
Hard Rock Cafe 2024
They're also building a Margaritaville in Kentucky. Way to lie to us Eddy.
As a Seattleite I gotta pull you up on “entire” country. PNW is real
These guys are gonna do Bubba Gump next year. I’m calling it now!
For the second and final time you hit the road yeah right can't wait for the next cross country trip
They said it couldn't be done. He did it. They said it couldn't be done twice. He did it twice. All around the country at novelty restaurants. Thank you for your service! 🫡
WHYYYYY
Ok, do McDonald’s next.
Every single Chuck E Cheese is next.
Why do you keep doing this to yourself
Ok now do mcdonalds
Do Chuck E. Cheese next ❤️
Medieval Times next!!!!
Why do you keep using a pickup truck?
bubba gump.
next episode, getting coffee at every starbucks in the country
Great viddy, Edeo
next: EAT EVERY MCDONALDS IN THE WORLD.
Next year, eat at every McDonald's in the country
Eddy have you learned nothing
53:00 “you look lonely, I can fix that”
The epic sequel! I look forward to watching this more than any summer blockbuster this year.
One time at the Shreveport Louisiana margaritaville casino I was staying in one of the rooms and overdosed on painkillers and animal tranquilizers and it was extremely eye opening and made me realize how I was effecting everyone around me, that was a very dark time filled with desolation and despair, thank god I’m in a better place now, if ur struggling please seek help and Godspeed <3
as someone from syracuse, I think you may be the first person I've ever seen actually go to our margaritaville. I've walked by that lifeless husk of a restaurant dozens of times when I've had to go to the mall, and it's literally always that deserted, even at happy hour. I have no idea why its still open lmao
As someone who only learned about you from your Rainforest video, this is exciting.
it was so cute going to the Atlanta Margaritaville review page on Google and seeing all the people commenting stuff like “thanks for helping out Ted and Eddy” with 5 stars :D
I'm from Kentucky and would literally do anything to build another "THE THING" down the road from the Creation Museum.  No reason.
I think that the fact that neither of these corporations have locations in seattle says something really nice about that city.
THE JSCHLATT JUMPSCARE
Cool. This was like the other thing,  but worse.
your rainforest vudeo became a confort video for me so much and this is a delight
You shouldn’t have done this twice. Because of the rule of Three. You have to do it again next year.   Joking aside, I’m really impressed. Good job on two journeys!
Not the censored toes! You know I'm broke, Eddy 😖
I want taco bell
EDDY WHY
inspired by jury duty
U look like a 50yo just discovered zara and tiktok and now he’s trying to dress like the youngsters
This series has made my year.
It was cool to see Eddie show up in my city, Syracuse, for one of these videos. It’s fitting that it’s the shortest part of the video tho seeing as that mall is dying. If you’re trip wasn’t bad enough, I have to be the one that tells you this. If you had drove just 1 more block you would have ran into our local waste management facility 😃👍 hope to have you back soon
34:13 Hey thats my home town of Augusta Ga lol
What are you talking about the cat in the hat is the most comforting place I’ve ever been
There's a Margaritaville Casino Resort in Bossier City, Louisiana that you missed
THE BEANNNNNN💣💣💣💣
So is Bubba Gump or Dick’s Last Resort next?
I can't wait to see Eddy go to every McDonald's in the United States
do BUBBA GUMP next
i vote for you to go to every bubba gump place next year
You didn’t go to Saint Thomas
yall should go to casa bonita. i dont think its a chain or anything its just a really good REALLY themed restaurant. im pretty sure the owners worked on south park, also, but i might be misremembering that.
MR PRESIDENT A SECOND EDDY BURBACK CHAIN RESTAURANT VIDEO HAS HIT YOUTUBE.
HARDROCK!! HARDROCK!!! HARDROCK!!!
"Pour me somethin' tall and strong... this door is to remain unlocked during business hours" - Jimmy Buffett
I was incredibly excited to see the Pigeon Forge part since I had been there two summers back and at Universal Orlando one summer back  I’m sad he didn’t see the Jurassic ride there, or at least mention it, as it’s really bizarre, but eh, beggars can’t be choosers
Comment 👍
Out of all the possible conspiracy theories regarding 911, Ted did it is probably the most coherent.
next year is Bubba Gump shrimp company, another restaurant at the San Antonio river walk. if there is a weird themed restaurant, they have one at the river walk.
WWJD
POV: you’re Eddie Burbank having a Jimmy Buffet induced dissociative episode
Another video of Eddy going on a needlessly long road trip to eat the same subpar food at various locations of the same gimmicky restaurant? OH fuck YES sir!!
Eddy... I hate to break it to you but you missed the Margaritaville in North Atlanta at Lanier Island
7:12 BRO THIS IS GOING THROUGH PALM SPRINGS! I DRIVE THIS ROAD EVERY DAY TO GET HOME. Edit: I watched the next 15 seconds and I feel stupid now.
“I beat the child”  -Eddie Burback circa July 20th 2023
McDonald’s next!
After watching this video, I think I got second hand drunk from the vibes in the video
Hard Rock Cafe next?
I must be old, the only musician I recognized was Vivaldi.
Y’all better close this trilogy out with Dick’s Last Resort or else.
the perfect sequel doesn't exi...
Glad to see you back Ted!
I am glad Eddy got to experience our lord and savior - Jimmy Buffet
Jokes aside...Eddie truly was pulling off all those hats
Islands of Adventure is the best Universal park, you made a great choice.
why do you look like cinnamon toast ken?
Eddie’s wasting away again in Margaritaville, wishing he hadn’t gone, some say there’s YouTube to blame, but we know it was his own fault.  Keep up the work man it’s good stuff.
Ty so much for doing this again.
Next you should go to all those titanic museums shaped like the titanic
Hit the road for the final time? You still have to hit all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp and Paula Deen's Family Restaurants
I've been to that mall in Syracuse, live kinda near it. When I heard you were going to go to that one I said out loud, "that's probably gonna be the worst one". Not disappointed. Well kinda disappointed but not expectation wise.
So the cat in the hat did terrify me as a kid, and if I had gone on that ride I would’ve lost my shit
At this rate, youre gonna hit every restaurant in the Mall of America. I guess the next one is the Candy Factory
You missed the chance to go on the shitty Margaritville Cruise ship.
Palm springs margaritaville???
That rain forest video must have done well. Looking forward to your next chain restaurant tour!!
Bubba Gump
bros trying to get all the collectables on the map
12:33 The thousand yard stare of a man who has seen too much.
Man, I worked next to that Margaritaville on Broadway for years.  Old people would always duck out on their tab and they'd always end up at Margaritaville.
Eddy you worry me
So next year will be The Hard Rock Cafe, right?
I now will forever see Samus' helmet design as a margarita inside a red map marker
Eddie’s next video: My stalker from Texas
Too bad the the one at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut closed a few years ago lol (probably would've been the smallest one)
Eddie why did you skip Gatlinburg TN they have a Margaritaville too
eddy i know i havent been here since the rainforest cafe video... and now im back for this one.. but please for your health dont make this a series
I think you single-handedly paid for Jimmy’s next plane
Can’t wait for next year when you and Ted do all Cheesecake Factories
I'm from Cleveland but the only Margaritaville I've been to was the one in Niagara Falls. it was the worst dining experience i'd had that decade
holy shit. amazing video
you missed the one in carmel CA
nah yeah HARD fl rain is srs shit, ur 100% right
As someone who didn’t know Margaritaville is an actual place I’m amazed and terrified. I can’t believe you did this twice.
Eddy don’t kill me but maybe Hard Rock Cafe is next
16:26 if only the what if museum knew the actual reason the dinosaurs got wiped out
Everyone thats been to burbon street knows he didnt film bc hed be demonetized
Bubba Gumps?
“i jimmy’d a little too close to the sun” is one of the greatest lines i’ve ever heard
As a Cleveland native, seeing the Tim Misny sign really made me happy (he’ll make them pay)
come to the uk and do wetherspoons
Now do Applebees

I already watched teds vid sorry
i like these travel style vlogs you've been doing. can't wait to see what tacky restaurant you choose to tackle next
I'm from a tiny town in Maryland. Jimmy Buffett actually sued a little food shack that was called Cheeseburgers in Paradise years ago, which forced them to change the name to Beef n Buns in Paradise instead. Still a great little place to eat and get ice cream, but with a name that doesn't quite sound right. Haha
This is your magnum opus
I have a creeping suspicion that this might not have been Eddy's last trip across the US
can't wait for the hard rock cafe version of this next year
Does anybody know what breed of dog that was in the gast station?
you are a wild man
See you next year when you hit every Bubba Gumps in the US (and Canada)! ;)
This video unlocked a repressed memory for me omg LOL, I got hit in the head by a serving platter at the universal studios orlando margaritaville when my family ate there when I was younger and got a free shirt out of it
I’ve worked in the destiny mall you guys went too. That margaritaville never looked open since there was almost nobody there, surprised it wasn’t a desolate wasteland
Eddy you've said "final trip" a few times and I would be devastated if that's true. there are so many more chain restaurants that need you. America needs you.
Eddie should probably come to Colorado to eat at Casa Bonita at some point.
It's like a road trip with SpongeBob and Squidward.
So Hard Rock Cafe next year?
Damn dude, you were so fucking close to a Does Eat Place but went to have a meal at fucking Margaritaville instead. I’m so sorry.
Can’t believe you didn’t go to The Original Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio. It was named before the jimmy buffet song
A true masterpiece of youtube
as a San Antonian eenthusiast of both Buc-ee's and Margaritaville, this video is very satisfying to me
IBS Gang rise up!
Eddies slow decent into Marg Maddness is the salt on the rim of this video
The cat in the hat ride is so scary fr 😭
You and Ted should eat at every Outback Steakhouse and at every single one ask for your steak to be “extra sloppy”
Bubba Gumps next 👀👀
There’s one on Lake Conroe though
Out of all the videos I've seen on Youtube, this is certainly one of them.
Now, DO ALL THE MCDONALD'S! 🍔🇺🇸🍔🇺🇸🍔🇺🇸
Nooo you made this too soon. There's another one opening in Boston this year! 😢
Eddie is that a squirrel on your top lip?
Damn you never asked anybody in Mississippi how to say Biloxi?
As an Arizona native who has made the drive to Texas more than once; I have always wanted to stop and see the Thing. Thank you for doing this for me. Thank you for also showing me the inside of a Buc-ee’s for I was too scared to get lost.
The Thing Museum seemed like a fun, creative idea at first, but then it got a little uncomfortably close to actual conspiracy theories
You didn't go to all of them. You forgot Capitola, CA, this video is a lie.
Eddy joins a cult in order to push through the fatigue of eating at every margaritaville, and Ted drank a margarita.
smh cant believe eddy didnt go to the margaritaville in sandusky ohio, gonna have to redo the entire trip anyways this video was great i cant believe he did it again
I thought this was the rainforest cafe video showing up in my feed again but ITS A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT!!!
Soooo is hard rock next? :3
Is there not one in capitola … oh wait I think there is
Y’all gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next
BRB have to pull this up on my tv for ultimate viewing experience
Not a single “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere” reference throughout this entire thing makes me think that Eddy has just never even heard that song.
Now go to every McDonald's!
The part 2 we never knew we needed
The beach club is pretty good.
Tweet
i was so stoked to see this in my feed. please make this an annual series
I don’t fuckin care if he did this again because the first got so many views, it still rocks.
This video has everything. Joy, philosophy, tummy ache, self reflection, PTSD, murder plot. Looking forward to next year's.
29:50 you should've taken the hat
Eddie pulls the psychotic break look off very well
@EddyBurback I hate to be a bummer but there is a Margaritaville resort and casino in Bossier City, Louisiana...
This man is on a warpath. ESPN Zones and Hard Rock Cafes BEWARE!
It’s “buh lux ee” not “buh lox ee” but that’s okay
wake up babe, the best youtuber just posted another banger
There's another margaritaville resort in Gatlinburg tenn. The town beside Pigeon Forge
Rip the Ft. Myers Margaritaville :( that damn hurricane
please do this again next year with all the subways
You missed Palm Springs? I googled and they definitely have one there.
eddie go to all mcdonalds in united state
Amazing, I hope this series continues, but hopefully not at the expense of Eddy’s sanity and stomach 😂
There goes Eddy, wasting away again at Margaritaville
Oh my God you did this again 😂😂😂😂 I never thought you would do another one of these after Rainforest Cafe 😂😂
I think you guys genuinely need to see a doctor after this because Margaritaville has some of the saltiest food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I went to the times square one pretty soon after it opened and they had a pre-recorded music segment every 20 mins or so but our server forgot about us so we just sat there bloated af listening to the same recording of Jimmy Buffett over and over
Calling it now, next year will be Hard Rock Cafe
Hard Rock Cafe. Medieval Times.
Sixty years from now Jimmy Buffet is going to be a real cult instead of just a weird Boomer thing.
The greatest foe of all time. Eating at Every Hard Rock Cafe
This documentary of schmaltz Americana tourism circa 2023 is exhibit #1 of why the USA deserves its role as world police
52:11 - It woulda been so good if Eddy killed Ted at the end of the video - and then Ted's video has the same ending but from his perspective 😅  I want the alternate ending!
You should do bubba gumps next year. They do trivia about the movie and it’ll be fun seeing you dominate as you slowly learn every fact about the movie ever known
Day 13 margaritaville was a real one, its on a regular vacation spot for my family, ill have to represent
If this comments gets 15k likes Eddy will take me to every McDonalds in my city
4:48 HEY! It’s Jarvis 🫵
BTW Dollywood slaps
Do another
The Biloxi Margaritaville is partial new construction, partial casino hotel. The now closed Margarittaville casino is in a different location, a few blocks away.
Who hurt you man. Really. You suffered once for us and we were thankful enough.  This one is on you. The damage done. The lives threatened and lost. The civilizations destroyed. The reputations shattered. The tummy aches. The GAS MONEY. The therapy sessions that are sure to follow… this is absolutely on you, Burback.
legit enjoyed this vid. 😍
You should do blood tests after and compare with before
as someone who made the mistake of getting the jambalaya, it is awful. I dont think I even made a dent in my plate, bleh
do it again w hard rock cafe
So Senor Frogs is next yeah?
Coming home to this video after just staying at the Margaritaville resort in Orlando for the past two weeks is like Jimmy following me home like some sort of demonic entity. I suddenly feel the urge to enjoy a crisp land shark lager! Amazing video!
If i become a channel member do your toes get unblurred
The Rainforest Cafe broke him, and Margaritaville swoop him up
i’m glad he stepped up and really realized what margaritaville can be
*M A R G A R I T A V I L L E*
I saw Jimmy Buffet open for the Eagles a few years ago a Coors Field - it was so surreal.  I was surrounded by 30,000 dad doppelgängers.  Everywhere I looked I saw my dad.
now for the ultimate chain road trip…. BUBBA GUMPS!!
"Finishing his video in his room" is just "finishing in his room"
They didn't go to the margaritaville at the puerto rico  airport
can't wait for the third in the series where they go to every hard rock cafe
Final time like this is right NO MORE BURGERS ; Next year : Every Surviving Chuckee Cheeses in North America
Last time he says... C'mon guys, what about EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE?
Idk if it was intentional or not but the way you pronounced Biloxi hurt me😭
Keep buccees name out ya mouth
20:32 i literally live 2 minutes aways from this Margaritaville, and literally have never seen the inside of it. I truly am thankful for you service Eddy for now I now know i never need to step foot in there.
Challenge: Every McDonalds in the US
Thought you were butt ass naked at 19:29.  Kinda disappointed rn :/
I tripple dog dare you to go to every McDonald's in America
Bro has ptsd
Holy shit the Statue of Liberty holding onto a margarita 😬🤣I don’t fuck with Christian nationalism , but alcoholic nationalism sounds pretty lit
Bubba Gump when?
Ever heard of Red Robin? Cus I would love if the next one would be that godforsaken place
20:28 you are so right about the Florida rain, especially here in Miami! Just last May we had up to 2 feet of rain come down and flood most of the lower parts of South Florida! And it wasnt even hurricane season! People were at one point literally kayaking in the streets with how much floodwater there was. It is no joke down here we are drowning!
What about the Palm Springs location?!
13:55 that part genuinely creeped me the fuck out. The chances are truely astronomical. Or he is a really bad government agent
I'm just now learning there's more than one Margaritaville
ooo another installment of eddy goes to all chains in food chain. can't wait for the mcdonald's one!
why tho
Now it’s time to hit every House of Blues in the country, the ones in Vegas and Orlando even have merch shops
I weirdly love this place and this would be a dream 😂
hey eddy! I triple dog dare you to go to every applebees in the country. You have to do it, its a dare. unless ur a chicken. Thx eddy!!
Not Ted doing the midwestern dad car inspection 😂
Bill-auch-see he says
Lol i cant believe you did this again
Amazing! One of the best videos!
you missed the margaritaville in the fort Lauderdale airport
eddy you are genuinely really stylish and i strive to look as cool as you
He should do every Cracker Barrel
Lol I just got super into “Cheeseburger in Paradise” and now this video comes out
I went to Universal in January for the first time and also went on the Cat in the Hat ride and thought it was pretty trippy for a kids ride bottom text
The word “hero” is thrown around a lot these days…
46:32 "I'm Tim Misny, You know what I do"
Eddy’s poor intestines must have a Pavlovian fear response whenever they hear his car start
You've never heard of boom boom sauce? Its decently common, It's at The Habit Burger chain and I get on my sandwiches from a southern California sandwich chain.
they went to rainforest cafe and got margaritas?? lmao these dudes are actually insane
What chain is next?
WHY DID U NOT GO TO BOSSIER CITY MARGARITAVILLE I AM CRUSHED
Not this shit again
I live in Atlanta, I KNEW you’d get stuck as soon as you said there was one here 😅 sorry friend, welcome to our hell
so what's next? Planet Hollywood? Hardrock Cafe?
Eddie stop
Next year: I went to every McDonald’s across the earth
44:38 your description of my hometown is so accurate it hurts to say i’m from syracuse lmao
Next is Hard Rock Cafe
Eddy you and Ted can't keep doing this to me This video is an hour long I don't care but like I'm still gonna be here 57 minutes from now thinking why the fuck did i do this but i did why
I find it kind of ironic how many times you used Vivaldi's Winter for the background while talking about a tropical restaurant in tropical locations.
There are 22 Bubba Gump Shrimp locations in North America. Do with that as you will
My immediate reaction to seeing this in my feed was "He did this to himself again? Why?" 😂
You should embrace the sweet comfort of death and visit all of the Cheesecake Factory locations.
Wasting away again in Margaritaville
Hey Eddy I really like Buc-ee’s and I wish you would go to all 58 locations you think you’re up for it? 🚙💨
You missed one in conroe
Now all Eddy needs to do is go to every Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. location in the US and Canada to complete the themed restaurant gauntlet.
y’all are always so tired when you make it to TN 😩 come back and do a dollywood video
When the synth played and the M&Ms came on I was like "huh. This would be a fun bade runner joke." Then he did it. Damn
so much lore for two dudes traveling the us and Canada, it's almost crazy
Great video, but almost ruined by Eddy's new desk being entirely too small ☹
Every McDonald's in America
34 Hard Rock Cafes in the USA....
Now do every Applebee's
Hands down one of the best sequels ever made. It’s got everything, world building, antes upped, character development, surprise plot twists! Whether it’s better then the first one is subjective, but honestly I don’t think it’s a debate there shouldn’t be another sequel, I mean why continue anything wrapped up in a neat little bow? With palm trees and margaritas embroidered on it. Edit: RIP Jimmy, one of the first music artists I ever listened to.
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
do people in america really just like ugly things or what is it with those weird restaurants???<
You missed a Margaritaville in Shreveport/Bossier
Omg Wisconsin Dells is def a Las Vegas street for Midwest families 😂
19:30 eddrick don't tease me like that 😩
What a time to be alime
Everything in this video is so painfully American
So next year is Bubba Gump, right?
The Justin Bieber references definitely added to the experience that was this video
Final one you say? … do bubba gump’s next 😂
Yo Eddy next year you should visit all the bubba gump shrimp locations
no way the rainforest video was a year ago
My first thought was “Eddie, why would you do this again”
Next Year @EddyBurback do every Medieval Times Dinner and Show, there are only 10 the first one in Beuna Vista Cali
I clicked this thinking "if he really rehashing this idea already?" And yes, you are.
Imagine you work in a rainforest cafe (and are, I assume, therefore aware of the video) and Eddy just walks in. Like what the fuck.
i’m watching this WITH a bucees blanket on
ended the video with buying some more merch because  it's finally re-stocked ❤
52:50 is def a bladerunner 2049 reference
I went got a real shit cocktail at margarita ville once cause I had to use the washroom
In the immortal words of Eric Cartman, "Nobody likes Jimmy Buffet except for frat boys, and alcoholic chicks from the south."
I mean… there are only 22 Bubba Gump shrimp restaurants in the states…
The sacrifices you made for humanity shall never be forgotten. Or forgiven
I’m screaming😂 this is peak Burbank shenanigans.
You missed one in lake Lanier islands in cumming ga
This is probably the end of the series, but imagine taking Schlatt as a hostage on such a trip 😂
Was the Margaritaville at Lake Lanier in Georgia not open yet? Oh man, I would have loved to see you guys go there! Still, great video!!
"but you can't see them because you didn't pay me!" Eddy, does this mean that we can pay you and you WILL send us feet pics?
Watching this video after having watched Ted's is like playing the A and B stories of a NieR game
The annual trip around the country visiting every single location of a particular theme restaurant chain. Love it
Back to back across the nation champ. Forrest Gump levels of dedication
You missed lake of the ozarks in Missouri.
Yes, YouTube algorithm did it’s magic! I saw your Rainforest Cafe adventure last year and now this Margaritaville Marathon has graced my eyes. Thank you for your crazy commitment.
WE LOVE BUDDY
I think Eddie has PTSD 12:24
Eddy, for the sake of your health, please never do this again.
Babe get the nice glasses, Eddy's back.
Great video Eddy, I'm sure this will go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.
The tummy issues were inevitable the way you were acting out there 😂
For you guys wondering, and I will tell u this as a clevelander, the guy raising his eyebrow in the Cleveland billboard is micheal Minsy, who always makes them pay
Y’all missed out on the MARGARITAVILLE cruise that goes out of the port of Palm Beach in Florida!
Do this with chilis
ben and adam core
As an Average Mississippi dweller I cringed every time he pronounced "Biloxi"
But but what about NorCal margaritaville? 🥲
Appropriationville
That Margaritaville "in development" in Boston has been "in development" for over a year. I severely doubt that it will ever open for business...but if it does, I will go there in honor of your sacrifice.
IT'S NOT B LOCKS C, LUX JUST SAY LUX PLEASE
Your journey isn't over. There is one more to be conquered.  HARD ROCK CAFE
the only time i’ve ever been to margaritaville it was at City Walk and i DID get to see a band play. They played Baby Shark and then their biggest hit with the crowd was after someone requested they do Adams Song. The one by Blink 182.
why doesn't any of them have a jimmy buffet buffet :(
The story building between yours and Teds is perfect. These are great, well done 👏🏻👏🏻
ok, now go to every amtgard park in the usa and canada
I love that the Atlanta location bit you with traffic! That’s Atl for ya
You should go to every McDonalds next 😏😏😏
I can't believe Eddy was in Oklahoma
I live near Destin we use to have a cheeseburger in paradise, the margarita villa and a lulu’s all within a short drive it gets annoying
Teds 2002 Toyota tocoma was taken by the tow truck
Can't wait for the Ted and Eddy 2024 Hard Rock Café Tour!
Hard Rock Cafe has 34 North American Locations
Dude, why did you exclude the cruise, you were right there!
watching them eat those meals and drink all of those margaritas made me stomach hurt vicariously
you know your not done... lol
I live 40 mins from Pigeon Forge and watching this was a spiritual experience. Thank you Eddy, and thank you lord Jimmy
So Bubba Gump Shrimp next year? There are 22 locations in the US
What about the Margaritaville in Conroe 😢
so assuming that they keep doing this annually and keep doing more and more restaurants every year like they have, how long until the "I ate at every restaurant in North America" video?
Eddy what is wrong with you you beautiful beautiful man!
my personal fav Margaritaville was one in the Carribean. It was a literal nonstop party with a pool
The wild thing is, if Eddy did this last month, a Margaritaville opened in South Padre Island, Texas while they were visiting them all. So, for sure, by the end, they had not in fact eaten at every Margaritaville in the country.
You missed the Margaritaville in Bossier City, LA. Fake fan!!!! 😂
For future reference Eddybro, Biloxi is pronounced "buh lucks ee"
Hey so there’s a Margaritaville on Lake Conroe you missed
Now do Bubba Gump shrimp to make this series a trilogy 👍
Me: I’ve visited over 75% of the cities where a Margaritaville is located.  Also me: I’ve never been to a Margaritaville 😅
as someone who grew up in southern Louisiana, Eddy’s pronunciation of Biloxi is making me so giggly
I wish you wouldve reviewed the margaritaville in Jax Beach. Absolute eyesore to locals and TRASH food and service.
i already know this vid is gonna be a banger
No one was asking for this but we all needed it
So next year is gonna be al medieval times restaurants?
finally, a video where ted gets a taste of his own medicine, thanks eddy akdhsj :D
So sad that schlatt killed 27 people in San Antonio
Please Eddie eat everything at dollywood this is what we all need to complete our life. 🙏
I can’t wait for Eddy and Ted to go to all the Bubba Gump restaurants in America next year!
Hey my man, You mention you have stomach issues/tummy issues everytime you eat something fried. Ask your doctor about gallstones, you may have an issue with your gallbladder from all the oil, def recommend you ask your doc to check you out.
You should do this again but with the Hard Rock Cafe
You two are amazing, thanks for doing dumb shit for our entertainment!
ok, now do bubba gump's shrimp co.
I hate Jimmy Buffet
Kinda a missed opportunity that restaurants owned by a man named Buffet aren't buffets.
I just started the video, and I noticed that the Cheeseburger in Paradise isn't the true one. The song itself requires Heinz 57, whereas the one at Margaritaville supplants it for whatever "paradise sauce". In an ironic twist of fate, the paradise sauce itself blocks the way to paradise.
I literally rewatched the Rainforest Cafe duo last week and hoped y'all would do something like it this year.
Looking forward to the Hard Rock Cafe one next year.
Which trip was better?
There's an not insignificant amount of feet in this video. More than you would think
I enjoy the yearly paying of your vacation with my eyeballs
by jove he did it again!
Eddy should consider himself lucky he didn’t go to the Air Margaritavilles in FL airports.
If you'd have done this a few years ago, you'd have to stop in Delaware again lol
Why do you do this to yourself
i didn't know i was afraid of the very specific scenario of having to eat an entire plate of cheese and then going on a rollercoaster after just barely surviving stomach issues but you learn something knew every day. you're braver than the marines for doing that Eddy, i salute you 😭😭
You did this trip a little too early lol. There will be a new Margaritaville resort that's being built on Fort Myers Beach, FL coming soon.
I'm shocked to learn that margaritaville is an actual physical place.
Yep, Oklahoma and casinos. Sounds about right.
Anyone else think the location markers looked like samus' helmet at first
oh god, no eddy no what have you done...
So bummed yall missed the one i grew up by in Bossier Louisiana 😅
I feverishly await the third in the trilogy, where you find some other ridiculously themed restaurant but go in some complete opposite direction. Medieval Times, perhaps. There's only nine of them...  start in IL -> Toronto... end in LA?  . Another commenter suggested Bubba Gump, but there are just too many in California (and one in Edmonton????)
Second and final? Babygirl this is an annual thing now deal with it
Fear and Loathing in Margaritaville by Eddy S. Burback
Every Medieval Times in the US and Canada....DO IT
Next should be every Dick's last resort lmao
‘The Thing?’ exhibit is the most American thing to exist…. I’ll refer to the creationism museum
As a Florida Man myself, I can confirm that rain exists
u did it again omg
talking mess about Binkley > having a friend named schlat
boirp
Stuck outside of Margaritaville, with the Rainforest blues again.
I heard a rumour that next year they'll be going to every KFC in the Northern Hemisphere
ebby burbank is back i can finally feed my children
As somebody who lives very close to the Mall of America, i knew he was going to react to it being 10 feet away 😂
HE DID IT AGAIN?! WHYYYYYY?!  Good content though.
now do hardrock
This year in “let’s traumatize Eddy” we indoctrinate him into a cult!
I dont like how you said "for the last time", i need an annual "i ate at every ****************** in the country" video.
can’t wait to see what you do for third road trip😇
Hard Rock Cafe international tour?
That’s cool now eat at every McDonald’s in the U.S
MARGARITAVILLE CRUISE MARGARITAVILLE CRUISE THEY HAVE A MARGARITAVILLE MUSICAL
And so, Eddy "Jimmy" Burback was born.
Eddy, are you being blackmailed?
Thank you for going to see The Thing. I use to live in AZ and saw those signs sometimes. And never went cause I thought they seemed desperate with all the signs. Turns out you proved me right.
Sorry but that kid definitely let you win at Stinky Feet 🦶
I'd say take a shot every time Eddy's tummy hurts, but you might develop a stomach ache yourself.
May as well complete the trifecta and eat at all the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company locations in the country.
you skipped jacksonville, fl :(
Can’t wait for every bubba gumps 😊
This video had better character development and story than most movies out today
How about "Dick's Last Resort" road trip for 2024? Only 9 locations, but get this, the staff have to act super rude to you.  It's YouTube Comedy Gold!
Falling into (and back out of!) the abyss of parrothead-hood. Epic!  My tummy hurts in sympathy.
oh hell yeah i was at that buc-ee's yesterday
i caught chlymidia getting sucked off by an escort in the Parking lot of the NJ Margaritaville. You are a top lad and very funny so figured id share the story =D
Every midieval times in USA and Canada??👀 We need a trilogy
This was such a good video! I am a new viewer and subscribed after this video :D btw, I live in Fort Lauderdale and you forgot the Margaritaville in FLL airport!
Washington used to have a Rainforest Café. Other than that we have none of these social restaurant things.
46:32 Hey, that's Cleveland legend Tim Misny. He'll MAKE them PAY.
truly blessed to have a rainforest cafe and margaritaville within a half hour drive 🙏
I need a margarita tier ranking of all the different drinks asap
I love that Eddie and Ted's dynamic here is basically the exact opposite of the rainforest cafe video
the syracuse one was real i dont think ive ever eaten it or seen anyone eating there lol
Was that Nakey Jakey at the first restaurant?
Cool, now eat at every McDonald’s.
Eddie thank you for your service. If only I could shake your hand.
I could've sworn the Jungle video was like 3 mmaaaaybe 4 months ago! What is time anymore!?!? 😱
Canada Day?
Only real gamers can beat 4 year olds at Stinky Feet.
You missed the margaritaville in Sandusky, OH. Literally didn't go to every location in the country
Buc-ee's is a haven for fascists. That's what I know. That otter might as well have a funny mustache. My dad loves the place and he is 100% a fascist. lol  I gotta give you props for giving all of your praise to the workers at that one Margaritaville though, while withholding praise for the corporation. Boss move.
I cant believe we've killed the world climate for margaritaville merch
What about the Margaritaville cruise?
man i havent watched an eddy burback video in a couple years lets se whats up-  oh.
Next series: All the Buccees - which, admittedly, isn’t quite the same volume as Hard Rock Cafes… but perhaps less traumatizing? Hahah   Btw, as a Mississippian, I feel the need to tell you it’s pronounced like “Bulluxee” - but since you have subjected yourself to such lengths, I’ll give it a pass 😆
You guys gotta do The Old Spaghetti Factory next time!
I think you skipped a margaritaville 👀👀 in Louisiana.
Now do every McDonalds
Bubba Gumps better be next.
Jokes on you for bluring your feet, I have a knee fetish and you made yours available for free!
Great video! However, unless this location is not affiliated with the rest: isn't there a margaritaville lake resort in Conroe, Texas? I think you missed that one
now go to every mc donalds.
The pigeon forge one has excellent wings
Eddy, why did you skip the Palm Springs resort?!
Next year he goes to every margaritaville and rainforest Cafe in the same trip
you missed the one in the san juan airport in puerto rico, so, gotta do it over now
Up next every chuck e cheese in the country?
YEAAAHAAHHAHAHAH do it again!
A case can be made that not only The Rainforest Cafe but also Buc-ee's are recurring characters in Eddy's story
Margaritaville: 👄💅🏻  Eddy: I BEAT THE CHILD
NEW COMFORT VIDEO JUST DROPPED
Did you try the  _AIDS Burger In Paradise_ ? 😋
...what a fun vide- OH MY GOD IT'S JARVIS
Hey “Eddy”. The title to this video is FALSE. You did not attend every Margaritaville, YOU MISSED ONE! They recently opened up a Margaritaville Resort here in South Padre Island , TX.
Everyone has self reflection when they get diarrhea
Syracuse local here. I'm sorry that our Margaritaville wasn't up to snuff. If I was there I definitely would've told you to steer clear.
I’m so so excited to watch this when I’m stoned
In memory of jimmy buffet. 1946-2023 rip
One personality type vs another  when under duress Eddie can’t handle the pressure 😂
Can you do every GiGi's Cupcakes? We fear for your mental wellness.
Omg omg omg
Missed the Jacksonville Beach Margaritaville :/
you did cleveland so dirty lol
Theres no fucking way we're living in a simulation when you can do shit like this
Well I'm from FL and the rain isn- okay yeah, it gets a bit ridiculous out here.
I love love love that ATL repped that well! Southern hospitality done right!! And yeah the traffic always sucks.
Every Margaritaville has a stage, just in case Jimmy Buffet should show up and want to perform -- just like how every Scientology org has an office for L. Ron Hubbard.
Just wait for him to see casa bonita
52:52 You look lonely…I can fix that
The bean is filthy, someone needs to windex that bad boy
My dad once was a roadie for Jimmy Buffet.  Jimmy treated the roadies the most respect. Drinks, steaks, cold fish bar, and beer to go paid by Jimmy. Apparently jimmy treated everyone so well because he knew the would help him with his extreme phobia.  Apparently he had a recurring nightmare he would be trampled to death by his fans. So to help his anxiety he required that he could see his limo to the side off stage. As long as there was a clear path, he would play no problem. So he treated the roadies well so he could play well.
According to the map, you forgot the Shreveport/Bossier location in Louisiana. It’s newer but has been there for about 5 years at least.
The downside to finding this video when you work at one of these locations is having to be the one to tell your coworkers that the people in the video didn’t like your food or drinks
i once got stuck on the cat in the hat. for 30 minutes.
Next: all McDonald’s locations worldwide
You should every Buc-ee's next
Poor guy can afford to take a month long roadtrip with his friends! How will i ever sleep at night
IT IS A MENU RESTAURANT AND NOT A BUFFET?????
Next they should eat at every mcdonalds on the planet
WWBJD: What Would Buffet, Jimmy Do?
Wait, is there no Margaritaville Casino in Bossier City, Louisiana?
Hard Rock Cafes next
I genuinely love these.  I always adored how in the last hell trip, Eddy and Ted were both the villains of each others stories, with Ted loving every minute, and Eddy....not. I'm hoping for a repeat. But the other way around.  EDIT:  Amazing. It's just as I hoped.
This is my Barbieheimmer
Hard Rock Cafe next please
Next video idea. “I ate at every McDonald’s in the country”
time for the overseas trip
RIP to the Spencers @ the Tyler Mall in Riverside.
You missed one. Margaritaville Lake Conroe
this is rainforest cafe part 2
I’m fully convinced that Eddy, does IN FACT, enjoy obscure chain restaurants  I’m also worried that soon we may find ourselves watching an Eddy video where he eats at every…SABRO’s left in the country 😳 🤮
I appreciate these journeys so much.
I ate at one in Mississippi
@EddyBurback  You need to see the Margaritaville Condos in Sarasota. Yes, people LIVE and make their HOME in places named after Margaritaville. "Compass by Margaritaville"
As a Brit, those fish and chips looked sad
why u copy ted nivisons video GRRR
Sick!  Do it again.
10:01 THANK YOU! ive been saying this for years and nobody will listen to me.
Eddy...you didn't have to do this  Juat kidding of course you did
can't wait for eddy to eat at every mcdonalds in the country
As a Canadian, I am in both disbelief and awe at the amount of themed chain restaurants in the US. How is there such a big market for this?! 😅
i have only ever been to one margaritaville and it was he niagra falls one on vacation in 2018. all i remember about it was having a panic attack in the margaritaville bathrooms and seeing a skunk on the street after. thank you eddy for recreating these memories so well in this video
If you go to Florida especially during the summer, expect rain.
Can't wait for the chuck e cheese tour
"2nd and final" we'll see about that.
This felt too scripted
do McDonalds next
Can he really claim to have eaten at every Margaritaville if he didn't eat on the Margaritaville cruise ship?
Glad you had fun here in Mississippi! BTW, it's pronounced B-lux-ee. A lot of people mispronounce the city name though. Oh, and Buffet is from here! Well, nearby Pascagoula, MS.
You think your the king of stinky feet 🤴 no I'm the king of stinky feet 👑-eddie Burbak (top 10 best quotes)
8:20 i've had literally that exact experience, its intense
How much money does Jimmy Buffet have?
I ate at every McDonalds in America when?
the fact i watched 22 days of a mans life in 29 minutes and 22 seconds
This is cinema
I like how when Eddy did the Rainforest Cafe and the Morbius video back to back he was like "it's just a coincidence this isn't my thing now" and now we get this.
This is why I subscribed
10/10 film. christopher nolan really hit it out of the park with this one.
Are you doing Planet Hollywood next?
I went to the Destin location when i was young. My family stayed long enough for the giant blender to fill up with green liquid, which triggers the "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" event. The whole place lit up green and the song played. I assume that's what the burping volcano was. I also assume that these events play every hour on the hour.
if you think about it you only went one place on the trip. margaritaville
Did he do it at the same time as the rainforest cafe trip?  Who does this twice?
I used to work at the Cleveland Margaritaville!!! I don’t know why they opened one here, not exactly the most tropical place, but it’s funny. Great vid as always! Been a sub since you started :-) (Also! The billboard of the guys eyes is like a Cleveland inside joke. He’s a lawyer called Tim Misny and the billboards where he does that face are inescapable here, so they did a sort of meta ad campaign!)
So ready for the "I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in the country" video in 2024
Next year's goal: Eating at every federal prison cafeteria in the country.
hearing Eddy's pronunciation of "Biloxi" is so endearing (also really happy you enjoyed the burping volcano)
If you don’t do Hard Rock Cafe next I will riot
I get why you'd drove a car you already own, but if you rented ...why get a tacoma instead of a van?? Dont have to buy a tarp and you'll spend 2/3 the cash on fuel. Luv 2 rent gas guzzlers for my 9k mile road trips
No one is ready for the Hard Rock Cafe quest in 2024
Please tell me that they had a pizza called MargheritaVille, please
LET'S GO
this is true journalism
Now to do Hard Rock Cafe.
eddy has the type of face where when he puts sunblock on he forgets to rub it in on his nose.
So there’s another Margaritaville community in Daytona Beach Florida. I photographed it a few years ago. That place is so fucking eerie. It’s a regular neighborhood with brightly colored houses and Jimmy musi blasting on every fucking corner. Whats creepier when I went to photograph it, some dude had passed away in his house, hearing a siren while the Jimmy music is playing was honestly the creepiest things I’ve ever heard in my life
NO NOT AGAIN
i feel like these trips are a really fast way to get burnt out :(
Eddy really is out here exercising his free will
I met jimmy buffet one time and he told me about how his worst fear was Eddy Burback reviewing every one of his restaurants across the united states and canada.
Eggy Burbank
ted has the grace of a gazelle
I like Busy Bee better than Buc-ees. 🤫 Don't tell my friends from Texas.  edit: what the fuck was the belching volcano about?????? Also, it was so cool seeing you in PCB! Nothin' beats a beautiful PCB sunset. <3
Ah shit, here we go again
Next year: Cheesecake Factory
i adore this man
it's pronounced bihluxee not bilocksee
you almost not making it to the atlanta one because of traffic really gave y’all an immersive atlanta experience ❤️
I've lived in Panama City Bech my whole life! Im glad you and Ted enjoyed your visit!
Keep up the epic content!!
The wiz needs to hear about this
theres one in Syracuse!? Maybe iill try one, definelty no beaches there trust me
48:30 I love Weezer’s new look!
Final Trip? no, you still have hard rock cafe to do :)
Dicks last resort next?
He forgot to visit the San Diego margaritaville 🥲
woulda not been as sick of it if u know, if you ordered more than the same 3 meals there lol
How dare you not trust a BINKLEY!!!!!!!!!!????????
Not surprised at all the only cop shown in the whole video was a Virginia state cop pulling someone, they're ruthless out here I'm tellin ya
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in" - The Yikes Guy
Every time I see an upload from this channel I know it's going to be a fucking banger.
El Paso mentioned, we won
hard rock cafe next!
Now do McDonald’s!
Do something more painful.... Like McDonald's.
the what if museum is just secret invasion but better written
My favorite part was when you guys went to Margaritaville by me. I love that place.
this literally is the american dream which is also a nightmare let me out  good on ya for not being a karen and sending your dried chicken back - at least not on camera
Margarita like will cook any fish that you bring in
46:31 MISNY MAKES THEM PAY!!!
There’s some Cheeseburgers In Paradise if you wanna keep the Buffett theme.
You skipped Shreveport Louisiana
The concept is mad enough, but to pointlessly do it in a pickup truck? Just why?
A skunk!!! Skunks are my favorite animal I am so excited you included the little guy :)
You missed the one in north Louisiana
I wouldn’t have let that Cleveland chicken anywhere near my person.
I saw the thumbnail and title and just audibly gasped "EDDY NO WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF". Godspeed brave soldier
I started laughing out loud as soon as I read the title, I can’t believe the mad lad has done it again
There’s a Margaritaville Resort opening in Fort Myers beach in a month lol
I’ve been to the one in Biloxi a few times for the games but not the food. Weird to see that place in a YouTube video. You’re making me wanna do a road trip of my own now. Not quite like this but yeah 😂
Eddy. please. you need to fix how you say Syracuse 😭😭
The return!
The artist who created the Chicago bean HATES it when people call it “the bean”, but he has claimed ownership over specific colours so no one else can buy or use them so please never stop saying it♥️
omg when you said that the rainforest cafe video was a year ago i got whiplash??? like that felt like a week ago to me tbh wow
TIL that the restaurant called "Margaritaville" that has a parrot on the logo that exists in Capitola California is not an official Margaritaville
Didn't expect to see a Buccaneer cameo in Destin. I very suddenly got flashbacks to my childhood at that moment, lol.
Drew ate dinner literally just a year ago and now you’re forcing him to do it again?? #CancelEddyBurback
I am so excited about this, hahaha
"Final"
I can’t believe you’re doing this again
James Buffet was only popular in USA wasn't he?
you forgot to go to the Margaritaville in the Ozarks
As someone who travels back and forth across New Mexico a lot, I’m a really grateful you’ve given me visual closure of the “thing”. Means a lot.
I was looking forward to you visiting the Margaritaville in Mohegan Sun only to learn that it closed in 2018.
River spirit casino is not owned by margaritaville... one section (a fraction of the whole Mvskoke nation owned facility) is themed after the restaurant a kin to the Mville resorts.... Tulsa Aslut backwards forever baby
Yoo i was just thinking this week about how wild The Thing was. Couldnt rememeber where i went but new it was around the new mexico or arizona area so this was perfect lmao
The sequel we didn’t know we needed
This guy deserves all the love and support he needs! After going through so much, we gotta give him something❤
but eddy why, why my guy
Your restaurant circus road trips are the best double drops w/ Ted  - we get both videos ❤
Cool now go to every hard rock cafe
Can you please make this a series? I know it's ridiculous and time consuming but damn is it entertaining.
the vivaldi at the end really sealed the deal
I was so excited when I saw this! It was really well done, but you missed the best part of the Vegas one! A lady actually slides down the volcano into the booze in a blender while priates and sea captains on stilts come out while singing the volcano song! She gets lifted out doing aerial acrobatics as well I believe. It is super wild, I wish you could have seen it. I was trying to describe the Vegas one to my boyfriend and he didn't believe me, I had to show him someone's video on YouTube of this happening.
The sequel I never knew I needed. My liver cried during this, but the character arcs were amazing. Also cannot name another song by JImmy other than Margaritaville, so educational as well. 10/10.
No Margaritaville Palm Springs?
I hope you didn't give yourself an ulcer with all that tequila and lime 😭
I haven't watched the whole video, so don't spoil me if Eddy loses his damn mind in the bathroom or curses never to eat fries again.
Ok but did u and ur bro talk before about twinning with the outfits or do y’all just do that lmaoo
little did he know jacksonville florida birthed a margaritaville last year haha as someone whos never gone to one im curious now tbh
how much for the uncensored version
Eddy i really hope you understand how much those videos are amazing
Oh no who let him leave the state
eddy this is the same intro as rainforest cafe. what am I supposed to do I hope ur ok
"What if aliens were a part of WW2" is just the Resistance series.
I didn't know how much I needed this weird little subgenre of video in my life. It's like a mukbang of mediocrity. Doing the Lord's work, Eddie. Something something shaker of salt.
he cant keep gettING AWAY WITH THIS !1!!!1!1!
You had a NOLA hand grenade & lived?! Shouts out
Eddy cmon man this wasn’t necessary
unlike the rainforest cafe, this one actually made me nauseous just thinking about margaritas every day
I appreciate your commitment to the bit. Cheers!
Now go to every dollar general in the midwest and south.
44:43 my names Spencer. Did you have a problem with my establishment?
Jimmy Buffet played the "sandbox" (US Navy Dock) near Dubai, UAE. I diidn't know about the show but as I was coming back from the city, his motorcade was blocking my path to the restroom which I was focused on when suddenly this friendly old man was in my face, hanging out the window of his SUV. He shook my hand and I said "Who are you?". He replied with a smile, "I'm Jimmy Buffet!". He had a great energy about him. Thanks for reminding me!
Why are you all friends
lud and schlatt’s musical emporium bangs
Next video, what about... Amtrak instead of car
Salt! Salt! Salt!
Next video: every McD in the US
Eating at every McDonald's in America when?
If there's a threequel to this series we all know Eddy is gonna murder Ted.
Interesting how many more "aw! That's nice" moments there are here than from the Rain Forest Cafe, mostly from serving staff and beachy places. I do think this place has a more adult AND chiller vibe than the Rain Forest Cafe, so even if it's chain restaurant food, nobody is screaming "VOLCANO!!!" and there seems to be less distracting elements in general.  I'll never go to one but I would love to go to the Florida Keys even more than I did before.
That's not how you pronounce poutine  good video, Eddy.
Eddy please!  Stop doing this to yourself!!
“My toes wiggled in the same sand Jimmy’s” or something but actually all of Key West’s sand is imported because it’s inside a reef.
One time at the universal Orlando margaritaville I ate a burger and my tooth disintegrated into it
Could you imagine bringing your child to the Thing exhibit and telling them that this is real history.
i think he skipped a margaritaville. there’s one in Shreveport LA as well.
Next year… Planet Hollywood.
OMG Nearly died when they went to the Thing💀. Glad they went after the renovations. All that's new. Before it was $5 to just see the Thing. Now its a whole exhibit. Didn't even get your fortune read by the alien.
My tummy hurts for you
I thank God I get to wake up everyday just to be alive to watch this 🙏🏻
Wtf why does he keep doing this
Cant wait for you guys to visit every American Girl Doll Cafe in America next year
I know jimmy buffet he's the guy from that south park episode where Cartman gets AIDS
is it just me or does the stache get more glorious with each passing day
So Bubba Gumps next?
Syracuse, NY... That's MY city! ... I'm so sorry. 😔
The sequel nobody asked for but we deserve
Did no one tell him there’s a Margaritaville cruise ship?
Can you do Bubba gumps?
When I saw the title I audibly said “YES” and ran to get lunch so I could properly enjoy this cinematic masterpiece
Why did you rent a pick-up to drive around the country? Why not a sedan, crossover, etc.?
Coming from Ted's video to see how the perspective differs
I used to live in Key West so I’m so happy to see how my home town is doing :)
This had the same energy as the first year of having twins. Just ringing in your ears trauma and forced enjoyment. 🙌
THE SEQUEL WE DIDNT KNOW WE NEEDED BUT THAT DEFINITELY DONT DESERVE
I hope someone sends this to Jimmy and the awesome manager 😂
Hell yeah
Such a small car to be in.....
You’re a good man, Eddie. If you ever come back to Texas I’d love to take you to  Margaritaville!
am i supposed to enjoy a vlog of you being miserable and talking miserable things?
these videos are my favorite content and eddy becoming more and more unhinged makes me happy and also worried for him
I am 100% certain there is not a single relationship in my life strong enough to make it through this
As someone who doesn’t live in America, this video has confirmed my belief that the USA is not, and cannot possibly be a real place.
Fun fact: the first time I went to the San Antonio river walk the police fished out a dead body
This video is just two men going on a month long bender and writing it off as a work trip
How was NO TIME SPENT on the giant flip-flop in the “Jimmy Museum” @20:34 You just flash passed it. I want to know more!
The real question is … where will he go next year?
next year you should do all the rainforest cafes.....again
Eddy can you get out of the way?
Gotta do hard rock cafe next summer
The best Margaritaville edit? Spongecakearitaville: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0qaZWT3UCk
Why Eddie, why
Do the stinky feet ducks have noses on top of their bills?????!!!
"The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea" -Eddy burback at 49:51
Next stop. The hard rock cafes.  Now that eould be a seeet video.
me watching this while wearing my bucee’s shirt 👁👄👁
Before even watching: EDDY NO
I love Eddy so much.
He’s back and no…he’s not the YouTuber we want. He’s the YouTuber we need.

New torture technique unlocked! Someone get the CIA on the phone
How much persuasion do you think it would take for you to visit every hard Rock Cafe in America?
bro i looked up the margaritaville song lyrics and that shit kinda goes hard?? like it’s a whole story about going through an alcoholic stupor in key west bc you can’t get over your shit and rather party it away.  song goes so hard bro.
I don’t know why… but I feel proud that there isn’t one in my state (Virginia). Couldn’t help but think of Jury Duty watching this lol!
We thank you for your service
Eat at every McDonald's in the country and Canada 😁😁😁
Proud to say I've seen two of these margaritavilles in real life. Universal Studios Florida and Navy Pier, Chicago.  UPDATE: Went to my THIRD Margaritaville (Cleveland, OH (46:34)) and sat in the pontoon boat. What an experience
Eddy did it first
you got to meet my sister who works at the margaritaville in Pigeon Forge at the island :)
I would go nuts working at that place and hearing god damn Jimmy Buffet everywhere.
The biloxi hotel reminds me of that hotel from Percy Jackson you get stuck in for the rest of time.
Trying to think what the UK version of these trips would be 🤔
Give me one margaritaville and I'll open my legs, give me-
Fins up Eddy… fins up
is buc-ees the mega wawa of the south?
19:18 what if Jimmy Buffet does have a secret OF page called Jimmy Buf-feets
48:24 that's crazy that eddie got weezer in the video
Every Medieval Times when
So... Bubba Gumps is next?
Next year I wanna see the same video but with McDonald’s
Damn I can't believe you came to Tulsa and it didn't traumatize you! LUCKYYYY!...I don't like it here LOL.
Great, now do every McDonald's!
Eddy you fool!! Did you not learn your lesson last time?!?
Was the one in Orlando still under renovation, when we went there last year a huge part of it was going through renovations
Danm I wanna go to margaritaville now and I’m only 7 seconds in.
27:02 is so real and absolutely killed me
Eddy became indoctrinated into the cult when he got to key west
now go to every cracker barrel
Ted’s wry smile appearing 20 days in BOTH times had cackling. Truly god’s perfect masochist.
i cant wait till next year when you and Ted go to the next themed restaurant. im gonna guess it might be Medieval Times
this is my barbenheimer
As I know Eddy reads every comment, this is my dare for he and Ted to do every Hard Rock Cafe in the U.S. and Canada next year
You didn’t even film the most traumatizing part of the Cat in the Hat ride. The Cats eyes are sunken in and it’s skin was falling off
They did it again. This is getting out of hand.
I know it would be near impossible to make this a series given how much travel and everything that must go into making the video. But I'd be down for it.
Excuse me sir! You missed the Margaritaville resort in the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri!
Same comment as with Ted's video. Dying at the way you pronounce Biloxi.
eddy burback came to my city wtf
you guys need to do every medieval times next
This saved my workday, watched it throughout the whole day in between customers
that’s just what his feet look like
hey eddie, you gonna write these meals off next year? curious
I worked at Cheeseburger in Paradise for 3 years. AMA
A fitting tribute to the song, really, all about being wasted and miserable and tipsy.
Ok, time to do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
You definitely need to go to Dollywood or Dollywood slash country before summer ends.
Hearing Eddy pronounce southern cities made my day
Tulsa mentioned!
LET'S GO!
Hard rock Cafe  ???, or another  anamtronic restaurant
Next year you guys should eat at every Mcdonald's.
I haven’t even started the video yet. Eddy, why? I know Danny gets adorably excited every time you two go out to dinner but can your mental health take it?
Waiting for part 3
So I’m are we gonna get Hard Rock next?
TED DID 9/11
I think you mean Pina Coladaburg.
Please make this a trilogy I beg of you
Gimme me one margarita....  you know the rest
Your guys’ excitement arriving at the bean was exactly how I felt finally seeing the bean this year also
Do every Mcdonalds next
The peak of mediocrity is Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville...
Can we get a moment of silence for this mans colon?   Golden colon if ive ever heard of one.
Doing God’s work 🙏
Ah yes, I get to watch almost an hour of content of a man ruining his stomach for our entertainment
9:30 Don't tell Schlatt about this...
Optimus Prime cameo
I saw this video and went "Eddy, why? Why would you do this to yourself again?" Then I saw Ted's video. "Oh, that's why."
I truly hope Jimmy buffet sees this
"I Jimmied to close to the sun" lol
did you go to the one in puerto rico smh?!!!?
THIS ISNT EVERY MARGARITAVILLE IN THE COUNTRY!!! THERES ONE IN JACKSONVILLE BEACH FLORIDA YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
Why is no one talking about The Thing???
We are not talking enough about the thing museum in these comments
Hard rock cafe trip next year...... do it.😄
Eddy’s feet pics have infinitely more value than Jimmy buffet’s
Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood next?
What a hero
now go to every mcdonald’s
I think that first margarita ville was the one in jury duty as well
this took "my tummy hurts but i'm being so brave about it" to a whole new level
Thank you for getting bigger sizes back in, Eddy!
Jimmy Buffett’s restaurants not being buffets is the most American English garbage   “Oh so this word has this route so it came from over here right” “Not even a little bit💀”
why does Eddy kinda look like Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters?
Did I literally miss the Key West Margaritaville??? Seems it was not in this video.
Phenomenal. Class act.
i like this new saga of eating at all the washed up themed restaurants, really is a good commentary on how the american dream has become nothing more than a mere spectacle
Going to just skip the one in St Thomas huh?
To fuck around is human, to find out is divine. You’re mad lads, the both of ya.
This was one of those times where I was so excited for the video I didn’t click on it for an hour
you gotta do a followup for the separate Cheeseburger in Paradise places.
Eddy you can’t keep doing this. Please come home, your family misses you.
i am spending a full 2 hours watching two guys travel to the dumbest places on earth
Idea: go to every bubba Gump in the country
Whats the point of this video especially twice
to quote chris fleming: SOMEBODY FRISBEE ME A CHEESY BURGER
Please do every McDonalds in the country…. AND CANADA!!!!
I think it’s time we upped the ante. Like this if you think the third restaurant in the trilogy should be MEDIEVAL TIMES: dinner and tournament
I feel like I’ve, I’ve watched this video before, nonononono, there’s no way, *he did it again didn’t he*
Actually just sat through an entire 1 hour long youtube video
This video is how I find out my local Margaritaville I went to once in the 2010s is very much closed 😂
Medieval Times next???
Hey, you guys should go to all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurants! There are only 34 of them, with 12 outside of America!
Now visit every McDonald's
Fun fact: Jimmy Buffet actually created Margaritas and Buffets 🤓
Do Hard Rock Cafe next lol
The sequel was fantastic, but we need a trilogy capper!
Before I watch this, I have to say I commend you for stomaching Jimmy Buffet. 🤮🤮🤮
Love to see more
This video has better writing than most marvel movies
Do McDonalds
mans think this rainforest cafe foh
I like the part where you went to margaritaville
Barney: IT BEGINS!
If you’re looking for more pain you could probably do Hard Rock Cafes
After watching teds video its feels like only one of them can be happy at a time and the other will be annoyed or paranoid
Eddy you may have missed Lake Lanier Margaritaville! EDIT -- maybe not?? you might be in luck. This says "Margaritaville" but it looks like there's not actually a "Margaritaville" restaurant?? 🤔 idk what's going on here
Well with that Misny sign, you’ve got the greatest piece of Cleveland culture. Can’t wait to see what your third annual cross-country trip is.
Destin native here, glad to hear y’all visited, but there was one place you were missing out on just nearby the Destin location. Jimmy Buffet’s sister, Lucy Buffet, has her own restaurant there called Lulu’s. One of three she owns as a matter of fact, come back and hit that one up when the inevitable bubba gump shrimp circuit happens
Edward how do I pay to see the toes
when i got the notification for this video being posted i said aloud "oh eddy why?"
I went on a 5 hour road trip with my friend who had a super old car that only had a tape deck. She had had an AV convertor, but it was broken. She only had one tape: The Best of Jimmy Buffet. It was a long day.
Why didn't  they go to the one in Missouri ?😢
I love that only Clevelanders will understand the Misny eyebrow.
Senor Frogs next plz
house of blues next >:) cuz i work there
Hey! Loved the video. Quick correction from a person who grew up in Tulsa,Ok its actually owned by the Muskogee Nation they just let him slap a name on there lol.
Isn't there a margaritaville in palm springs?
PLEASE!!! NEXT YEAR…DO ALL OF THE BUBBA GUMPS IN THE COUNTRY!!!!!!! It is a restaurant themed around forest gump!
i used to work at the MN one 😀
The final "I ate at every Margaritaville" slate has huge "Stop me before I kill again" vibes.
The Mad Lad is back
Eddy: For the second and final time, we hit the road again.  Fast forward 1 year…  Eddy: I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in the Country
Ok, so where are they going next year?
You missed the Palm Springs Margaritaville!!!
The commitment to these experiments inspire me! Next year... Buba Gumps??
Aaaaah! New Jersey! (Sentence that’s never been said before)
I love seeing you guys travel. Visit Medieval Times :D
jimmy buffet has/had a line of medical marijuana products called coral reefer lol. their 1:1 balm was actually really good at helping my arthritis but i can't find it anywhere now :<
I feel exhausted just watching the video. Think I'd rather die than try this myself.
2024: I ate at every Waffle House in the country
Bubba Gumps next lol
If you really wanna suffer go to every Cracker Barrel. There’s like 400 I think and they are EVERYWHERE
+
You missed Lake Lanier Margaritaville in Georgia
Ok. 30 sec into the video and I noticed your dressed like the president from Ukraine! I love it. Has nothing to do with the video. But lovely non the less.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
This video is literally just the rainforest cafe one but worse.
how about every McDonald's in the US 😂
they way you pronounced Biloxi is so funny. Cool to see inside it though cause i would always drive past it as a kid and would always wonder what’s in there
Oh boy here we go again
Making me wanna go to the rainforest cafe and Margaritaville damn you
What's behind the mystery door Eddy? You can be honest, I won't judge
Eddy! Why didn’t you let me know you were in Disney! Unsubscrubled, unless you buy me a margarita then ill forgive you
The sequel of the summer!!!!
When are you guys dropping an album called "4 Boys and the Bean" with the photos taken at the Bean™️©️®️ as the album cover.
Imagine finding out your local Margaritaville is actually closed from a YouTube video :( RIP Glendale, AZ location
I can't wait for next year's road trip
Can't believe what Ted did
My friend stayed in the Times Square spot for her birthday for some reason. He didn’t mention how the room was $300 and smaller than it looks. The bathroom is a rolling door because you can’t fit a door that opens out.
This all looks straight off a Red Robin menu, down to the onion ring tower
Incredibly unhinged of you eddy
I actually live a few hours away from The Thing, seeing that weird ass masterpiece be acknowledged is an amazing thing to see.
This was beautiful
Eddy why didn't you go on the Spider-Man ride? I love Spider-Man
So the solution to enjoying the first trip was to not do the trip like Eddy, and instead do it like ChaCha the Tree Frog
Can you please eat at every Hard Rock Cafe, so I don't have to?
Ooohhh you're getting a double view from me. Need something to listen to while I nap. Then I'll have to play it again so I can actually watch.
Cant wait for you guys to lose ur minds in the Dollywood bakery. Been there before, trust me.
noooooo not the Atlanta traffic
Jimmies status = Buffeted
If anyone tells you driving in florida rain is nbd they are LYING it’s the worst
Yeah as someone in the ATL area, you never truly are in ATL without traffic jams
When I was a young kid a lady gave a story time at church about driving across the country and visiting "The Thing" museum, but the whole point of the story was to build expectation then never tell us kids what it was. It's been 20 years of me not remembering enough of the story to Google it and I finally feel vindicated.
There are also Margaritaville retirement centers
I genuinely LOVE Jimmy Buffet. This video is exciting and I am so sorry you were wasted away, again, in Margaritaville.
I vote medieval times next
The best sequel! I love this so much! Please keep going to restaurants and give us the real food reviews.❤
Now do every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co
Can't wait till you guys visit every Hard Rock Cafe!
bro said bilocksee
eggy
You DID NOT got to every Margaritaville!!  There is one in Bossier City Louisiana you absolutely skipped.  This video is a lie!!  😮
they're building a margaritaville in fort myers beach, florida; the hurricane made it really easy for the land to open up. hope you come down and try it when it opens!
But Eddy, I TRIED to pay you to see your toes when I saw you at the beach, but you said “fuck off, weirdo” and kicked sand in my 2 year old sons eyes.
The rain in Florida really isn’t that bad, don’t know what you’re talking about
Wasting away again in Margaritaville.
Do every subway next
Jimmy buffet just reminds of the McElroy brothers now, every time
Brayden better come along for next year’s chain restaurant road trip
as a native Mississippi dweller, Your pronunciation of "Ba-locksi" is quite triggering.
They really weezered us at the bean
A LOT of drinking and driving
I went to a jimmy buffet concert once and I think it was comparable to the devil giving me a glimpse of my ill fortuned fate
Eddy, you missed the Margaritaville Lake Resort in Osage Beach, Missouri
FANTASTIC
Interesting story, but the Margaritaville in Biloxi is completely seperate from the failed Casino, which was located about 2 miles away. The new family resort is probably 5x bigger and is far more successful than the casino.
Excellent! Now, never do that to yourself again! ...but if you do, do all the Bubba Gumps
There's also a bunch of margaritaville 55+ communities I live near one
I just imagine eddy getting Vietnam level ptsd if he every has kids and sees a rain forest cafe or margaritaville and doing the thousand yard stare
hard rock cafe next !
Hard rock cafe is next  Then planet hollywood  You got work to do.
So i guess next year is going to be Cracker Barrel.
"The second and *FINAL* time...."  Little did he know...
Manifesting a trilogy with The Hard Rock Cafe
Must be nice to just have money to waste on shit like this.
Well now next year you have to do every hard rock cafe
This was magical!
Whats next? Señor Frogs?
this is the best day of my life
Diarrhea in Paradise !!!
Where you going on the next trip
you're a brave man
Every time you hear Jimmy Buffet take a shot...of water. Stay hydrated, it's what Jimmy would want.
You didn’t go to the Nashville Margaritaville Hotel?!?!?!?!
You should go to every hardrock cafe
I'd been to margaritaville The 1 in Pigeon forge Tennessee.
I'm early as hell but I gotta point out to Eddie that it's pronounced "moe-ho" bones lol it's a Cuban marinade/sauce. And if it's saying it ironically than oh well
I can't wait to watch the 3rd installment of this series next year when he go to every Bubba gumps
This….was everything.
You should go to every dicks last resort next
i live near pigeon forge and every time we have family visit we take them to The Island (the entertainment area you guys stayed at) as a joke. it the busiest tackiest place in the world and we love it. we’ve never eaten at the margaritaville though
Next up Medieval Times good luck sirs
You could've stopped this at Rainforest Cafe, but you did it to yourself.   Medieval Times next please.
Every bubba gump :)
Really upset you didn’t take the cruise — which is essentially considered to be the cheapest one around and, apparently, smells of sewage and old. Seriously disappointed.
I am so glad you discovered Biloxi. It is a fantastic, interesting historical part of the south. And its so close to New Orleans, and you can experience all these wonderful elements of Cajun history and culture. Im an Arkansas-born Cajun and my dad is from New Orleans and he really made sure to have us as a fsmily experience his people, culture, and FOOD.
There is one in Honolulu so I guess you aren't done...
as a fellow chicago person, i too believe in the power of The Bean
I was thinking about the Margaritaville song from TikTok when this vid came up, and when you said you’re girlfriend wrote it 🤯
I feel like you and Ted really shouldn’t be friends anymore
you'd think after the first time they did this they'd know better. But clearly Ted and Ed have a whole series to make
once during my first semester of college my parents came to visit and we went to the margaritaville in cleveland for dinner and i had a mental breakdown and sobbed at the table <3 so glad we both had such positive experiences at that location
“Finale” you doubt the strength of themed restaurants
Could you do like…. An in-depth super fun video about Casa Bonita
At this point I’m expecting MatPat to do a video on the lore of Margaritaville or whatever after this.
9:33 ...where was Schlatt on that day
All US and Canada Hard Rock Cafes next, right?
OH MY GOD, THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE!!!
hi jimmy
Saw this title and just quietly said out loud to myself "Oh God no Eddy, God no."
Next: Every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country
Thank you Eddy for being so brave about your tummy hurting
The Cat in the Hat ride is terrifying!!! And it's for little kids! And it spins so fast, they scream at everyone to take their sunglasses off when you get on. It's one of the only rides in the whole park for little kids and it's baffling.
SO YOU WENT TO THE FLORIDA KEYS AND DIDDN't COME SEE ONE OF YOUR LONGTIME SUBSCRIBERS😭 shame... jk I would really really love to meet you though ive been stuck on these islands for so long I need to get out I'm like Michael reeves without the tech skills.
I can't wait for next year when Eddy goes to every Applebees in the country.
its so funny to hear him say "what would jimmy do" as a silly little Eddy joke when that's literally also a lyric. Alan Jackson says "what would Jimmy Buffet do?"  in the same song as "pour me something tall and strong", the lore is so deep and Eddy was so intertwined he didn't even realize..... what is in those margs
Next video: I ate at every McDonald's in the world
eddys acting like this is the last roadtrip. i can’t wait for next years video, “I went to every medieval times location”
love the Margaritaville in Bossier City was skipped for NOLA instead.  Good choice lol.
You should do every McDonalds next
Eat at every McDonald’s in the country
Hate to be this guy but you missed the one inside the Detroit airport 😂  Did not expect to see another one of these videos keep up the great work!
EDDIE. YOU MISSED THE MARGARITTAVILLE AT LAKE CONROE. I WAS READY TO SEE YOU REPRESENT THE SMALL TOWNS. Disappointed.
The Rainforest Cafe PTSD made me legit laugh out loud.
not to be that guy eddy but there’s a margaritaville in osage beach missouri
I LOVE these road trip videos, they are so well edited and entertaining. If you ever do this again, it would be great if you visited one location from the previous trip, just like you did with the Rainforest Cafe in this one. May I suggest a Dick’s Last Resort tour? 😄 Love your videos Eddy! 💗💗
I waited for this video since rainforest cafe. God bless
The one thing it’s missing is jimmy buffet
Thanks ):
Dairy Queen veteran here: that's frozen grilled chicken
What if 9/11 was an outside job
YOU GUYS SHOULDVE DONE LIKE THE SUPER SIZE ME GUY N DO A HEALTH CHECK BEFORE N AFTER 😂😂
I literally just got recommended the Rainforest cafe video this morning, I’m nearly certain YouTube sensed this
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I said, "He's doing this again?!" "This is a terrible idea." 🏃🏽‍♀🏃🏽‍♀🏃🏽‍♀🏃🏽‍♀to video LOL
I always prefered Piña Coladaburg
First Rainforest Cafe, now Margaritaville? What’s next?
I had no idea there was a Margaritaville in MOA. We don't actually go there much. It's right in between two much better malls.
I'm eating a bowl of ramen right now. I'd give anything to be eating margaritaville. You should be grateful.
8:30 I love this country
If Eddy doesn’t visit every bubba gump across America next year I’m gonna riot
The us is fucking weird
what are the odds you see the same guy in a different part of texas one year later and he's wearing the exact same outfit
You missed one
spread it around. Teddy did 9/11
Glad to be at the grand premier of Margaritaheimer
Florida being called the sunshine state is a lie. It should be called the rain state fr
47:11 LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOO
The way that every time Eddy orders chicken it's horrible, but he keeps ordering it is both admirable and idiotic
my girlfriend used to work at the print shop that made the margaritaville merch shirt mugs and stuff 😮
Next time chuck e cheese❤
The first one was awesome, the sequel was breathtaking. But next year, the trilogy shall need to be completed.
Do Dave & Buster's next🎉
Eddy really is just slowly turning into the main character from the Lobster
Bot a single blended drink
You’re a true American hero Eddy
I like watching the light leave his eyes.
I hate and love the stash. Ted being happy, making Eddy irritated is content gold.
Them nachos hit different. Pickled jalapeños 🤤
So is this what this channel is now? I’m ok with that I guess
Gotta redo this trip
Coolest mfs on the planet 😂😂 that was awesome
I wonder what restaurant they'll do next year lmao
I went to the NYC location one last year! I was shocked by the giant LED Margarita too haha sadly did not do a margarita bar crawl
👍
Now do KFC.
I wonder if Eddy just doesn't ever wear sandals or if he sends a bill to everyone who looks at his feet when he wears them.
just watched  Ted's video, now watching this one. Can't wait to see how happy you are this entire video Eddy!
NOT THE THING
The repeated "no's" at the Canadian border control 😭😭😭😭
the fact that ted bought a THE THING? shirt is iconic
You fucking legend
So next year is every bubba gump shrimp right
Amazing Content. Love to Easter away again in Eddy Burback Ville!
I have but three small words to say: Hard. Rock. Cafe.   34. 34 restaurants in the US...
If there wasn’t so many, I’d suggest going to all of the Hard Rock Cafes. But that would be insanely expensive
Missed Bossier City, LA
If you’re really looking for a challenge, try every McDonalds in America… I’m sure we’ll eventually see you again…
you did this AGAIN?! are you into being tortured?! ;) Great vid <3 (just re-watched the whole series of "Par 9" and you clearly were the most sane character, lol, but your acting was the best as well)  <3
left a dislike because of the lack of feet and toes that were shown. was not aware eddy was such a big shot and too good to show us some feet now.
I literally was telling someone about the rainforest cafe video yesterday. How about that.
I can’t believe you did a blade runner
That Misney bill board makes me giggle every time
heyyy this videos a lie you didn’t go to the north Louisiana margarita ville
All I'm saying is that there are only 22 Bubba Gump locations in the US
When you find out the boys were in TN TWICE (one really close by) and you didn't even know it
As an Arizona native, I’m happy Eddie is sharing our culture with the world. Long live The Thing!
I watched the Rainforest Cafe video like 3 times over the past year. So excited for this!! I hope you guys will keep doing these road trips!
Time for the bubba gump shrimp company.
And now for the final road trip: EVERY. BUCCEE’S. IN. AMERICA.
my boyfriend runs a fast food restaurant (nothing close to amazing margaritaville but still) and he would get into so much trouble if he let any one of his employees close early. and that atlanta location is exactly why. if y’all had written a bad review they would have a bad review forever because a couple of their employees decided they wanted to be lazy on one (1) single night. psa to any fast food employees: don’t prioritize your feelings over the entirety of a restaurant. i’m glad they went out of their way to make it up to you and im sure they never closed early ever again
Hard Rock Cafe has gotta be next
Alright now go to every Taco Bell in the country
Im so happy this exists
I’m so sad you hated Syracuse 😢
I wish I had seen you drive through pensacola 😂
So Medieval times next?
I used to have one of these near me.
eddy you missed a location at lake of the ozarks in missouri !!!
I like how eddie degrades into a pessimist and Ted turns into a optimist again lol
rainforest cafe video is to the shining as margaritaville video is to midsommar
Please oh please now do Medieval Times, you have no idea how bad I need this.
Masterclass of a video
Pretty sad that a place called Margaritaville doesn’t have good margaritas, like that’s the one thing they should be doing right lol
I absolutely love that y’all went back to Rainforest Cafe !!  Please do every Chuck E. Cheese next 🐭🧀
Bump gump next year please
I think this video makes Eddie an official food influencer
"I think it might be tinnitus"😂
not again
The sequel I never knew I needed
I'd hate to eat deepfried food and then spend all day in a car... And I can handle my oil! Hilarious vid, you two buds are a riot
Biloxi is pronounced Biluhxi for future reference 😭
Eddy did someone make you do this? Blink twice if you’re in danger.
Well when they finish building that other one you can’t say you’ve eaten at every single one until you eat there too
Let’s gooo it’s been a long wait, gets me excited to see him upload!
well i'm from florida and the rain really sucks i'm sorry you had to drive through it. it literally rains every day in june and july and it's not like if you had just waited a different day it would've been better. again, sorry you had to go through that
This is a modern day epic, Homer would be proud.
Watching this just to see if he gets stuck at the rest stop down the road from my apartment again
Next is bubba gump
As a native Texan I have never gotten the hype with Buccees
not eddy hitting up Casabonita with the re-opening.
I hope mr.margaritaville himself responds to this video with a ukulele song.
I understand if you never do this again, but if you do can you please go to Medieval Times
I wish I had friends and money. That'd be cool.
honestly really cool seeing how Eddy's style has developed even over just the past year!
Rainforest Cafe: trial of the mind Margaritaville: trial of the body ???: trial of the spirit
“i think it might be tinnitus” LMFAO
49:34 man this is funny
He can't keep getting away with this!!!
I can't wait for next year where they eat at every Rain Forest Cafe AND Margaritaville in the same trip.
Why
PLEASE do Buba Gump shrimp next. It’s a forest gump themed shrimp restaurant with 34 locations
Seeing Eddy enjoy himself while Ted falls deeper into abyss was satisfying
Utterly shocked. Utterly delighted. Never thought I’d see a part two but the world is full of wonders
Every Hard Rock Cafe in the world when?
Next year do the *Yellow Deli* Sandwhich restaurant & cult!!!
What about the margarita in south padre island in south Texas?
Wow, why does a little guy like you need such a big desk
Fun fact about the one in tulsa. The river spirit casino has been expanding the river spirit side without the huge margaritaville side because while jimmy paid alot to get it set up, he also gets a cut of everything margaritaville related!
Thankfully you managed to snag the NYC one just in time. The officially announced that location will permanently close.
You didn't go to Shreveport Bossier Louisiana! They built one a few years ago.
top ten montages ever:  1. the chicago bean
i got this notification while i was at marshall’s and i said out loud “oh my god he’s done it again”
Impressive. With all those margaritas consumed and embracing the Jimmy philosophy, I wouldn't be surprised if you end up in a verse of a future Jimmy Buffet song
I'm just saying... eating at ever Joe's crabshack in the country would be a better feat... just saying
You know they have Margaritaville in Mexico?
You created this... You'll never outrun the pressure to continue chasing this dragon... Mark my words, you WILL do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next.  Ahahahahahaaaaaaa!
Whats next? Buba Gumps? Hardrock Cafe?
lol beat me to the Florida rain comment
I saw The Thing while on a road trip last spring break. My dad didn’t want to go inside and I’ve been dying to know what’s going on in there ever since. Now I know.
Jimmy buffet only put margaritavilles in cities that he loved. Except for Evansville Indians. Which is now shut down.
No.
You guys should tour Bubba Gump shrimps next so you can triple visit the mall of america
Next they should go to all 13,513 McDonalds in the us
Gotta do Bubba Gumps next summer
5:10 “it looks like It’s fully prepared for live music but it was completely empty for us” maybe… you were there for lunch and live music doesn’t happen until later?? What a stupid observation
All I’m saying is the Manhattan margaritaville ran out of limes on me…
Destin’s a really nice place, I had no idea there was a margaritaville
My God. He's done it again
If I had a nickel every time Ted & Eddy went to every single store of a restaurant chain with a specific gimmick in the continental U.S, I'd have two nickels. It's not a lot but its weird it happened twice.
I love you discount Burt Reynolds
Having worked in the restaurant industry my whole life, best thing about this video is that its going to be shared with all their managers and talked about in meetings. Lol
I like how you are giving yourself franchise PTSD
Next up, every raising canes in America and Canada
i did NOT expect to see schlatt in an eddy video lol
Next year, Bubba Gump?
What about Margaritaville at Sea?
Can't wait for the "I ate at every McDonalds in the country" video
this video led to me learning that the margaritaville in pensacola no longer exists and i have to say that i am beyond devastated and heartbroken and don’t think i’ll ever recover
this series is more compelling than the supersize me documentary
I’m not sure if they still do, but there used to be a Margaritaville cruise line…
I’m so glad to see you
fun fact, the mall in syracuse is suing margaritaville for not paying their rent lmaoooo
That npc on the highway must've been a mod 🤣 they left no crumbs
you can't go to the Margaritaville in Cleveland during the day!! 😭 no wonder it was ass
Tony isn’t your brother Eddy come on just admit that you cloned yourself
We can't keep letting him get away with this!!
My parents were in the Jimmy Buffet cult...
the thing detour was so good
Now you guys can do Joes Crab Shack
Growing up in Iowa, I had no idea that Margaritaville was more than just song. 😂
This is the best thing that could’ve happened to me today
Can't wait till you and Ted go to every Hard Rock Cafe to complete the trifecta
Did they miss the one in Conroe?
Next year you should go to every McDonalds in the country
THE SEQUEL
Theres a Margaritaville you missed in Osage Beach, Missouri. You must finish the quest for Jimmy
Would you believe they actually toned DOWN the Cat and the Hat ride? It used to whip you around those curves hard enough that you'd get bruises on your hips.  Also, the Tan Tara Resort in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, is now a Margaritaville Resort but apparently they don't have a Margaritaville restaurant? What's up with that?
Next eat at every McDonalds in the Country. You won’t.
I love how Ted and Eddy always have the exact opposite experiences
Okay now that we have a pattern, time to start predicting next year's trip! "I ate at every TGIF in the country."
You missed one, it’s in the D terminal in the Detroit airport. You gotta do the trip again.
Wow. Another masterpiece. Nobody does it like you! (Except Ted)
Next year u should do Cheesecake Factory
2044: the year Eddy, driven by some terrible instinct toward self-destruction, decides to eat at every McDonald's in the country. 2048: having spent the previous 8 months scrambling from one newly-opened location to another, Eddy seemingly snaps, throwing himself headfirst into a fryer. His closed-casket funeral is made even more tragic when the grease leaking from his body renders the casket transparent.
as an unfortunate cleveland native, i’m glad to see Eddy got a shot of one of the Misny billboards. he’s basically our local Saul Goodman
I can't wait for the sequel next summer when eddy and ted visit every hard rock cafe in the us...and canada
I had visceral childhood memories from that Myrtle Beach Margaritaville blender. Those storms that happen every hour on the hour and then the song plays while everyone sings along at the top of their lungs..... 😂
You 1000% were pulling off that hat
Drive to every Bubba Gumps
I deadass didn’t know we had one in Nashville hahaha
BEAN
Now do Casa Bonita 😈
Hard Rock Cafe next??
Absolutely loved this video from you guys, though I do have something to note as I was watching. All I’ve gotta say is there’s a pretty large margaritaville location in Missouri you guys didn’t go to. I always went there growing up, and it was a bit disappointing to see it wasn’t mentioned. In any case, I admire the effort put into going to all the locations around the US, as well as practically getting alcohol poisoning while doing so!
you missed a perfect opportunity to insert the "its the statue of LITTERBEE, I'M ABOUT TO SHIT MY PANTS" tiktok
there are 36 Hard Rock Cafe's in the United States and Canada.
The Biloxi pronunciation killed me
Now this is a video that makes me covet
he strikes yet again
When you're (unfortunately) from Ohio and you know the ORIGINAL Margaritaville is in Sandusky, OH
Thank you I needed this
You both should do the Hard Rock Cafes next
Sorry, cool video but you didn't eat at the Camp Margaritaville RV Resort Crystal Beach in Bolivar, Texas, so i'm going to have to boycott everything you do from now on.
Next year is hardrock cafe
Eddy theres only 33 hard rock cafes in the United States
Please tell me you didnt go to "THE THING"
Anyone else want to see this synced up and split-screened with the video we all either came from or are going to?
I live in Atlantic city. Im shocked you found it uneventful but honestly proud. It could have gone real sour lol
Edward Burblebacon
As an Oklahoman I’m so sorry you had to experience the waste land of Oklahoma.
Im from Florida and the rain is DEFINITELY a big deal. People already dont know how to drive here but they are ten times worse in the rain. Literally yesterday it was raining so hard everyone had to pull over because you couldn't see more than two feet in front of you. This place is a nightmare
Eddy I re watched your rain forest cafe video two days ago and now this?! Omg
Hear me out go to every McDonald's in the U.S
Well on the plus side you always got to your destination by 5.
The amount of times I’ve lost a friend in a bucees😂😂
I got a coffee and used the bathroom at a Margaritaville in pigeon forge..oh wait i did stay a night there and it was the worst hotel room ive ever experienced! Yeah i never want that experience again..im so sorry
Whats next, Bubba Gump?
Perfect sequels don't exi- Oh. Oh no.
There are 660 Cracker Barrel locations....your move.
"Now that's a Buffet Burn" is a straight up bar. I'm using it the next time my parents want to go to a Rain Forest Cafe over a Margaritaville.
I've been to the one in Myrtle Beach it was nice Broadway at the Beach is kinda weird bc it's like a man made lake area when there's a beach not far away
If this is becoming a series,  the only logical next step would be to visit every single Bubba Gump restaurant. I think there's like 30 or 40 too, so it'd up the anty 🤣
Next year: every Hard Rock Cafe in the us
Syracuse having the absolute worst Margarittaville is VERY Syracuse
This is what it’s all about
We always go to Margaritaville when we visit universal at city walk.  We usually stay for a week or two and like fitting it in, even though we know it’s super commercial, lol.
Next year, every Hard Rock Cafe in the world 🌎
i always enjoy the part of the video when Eddy rally's and starts ironically enjoying himself
Road trips for stupid reasons are still road trips
My moms last name is binkley. Also show me some toe
So funny how there is a margiritaville in oidgein forge tn and gatlinburg... like 10 minutes from each other.
16 minutes in and 2 Justin Bieber references
Every. Hard. Rock. Cafe. I am begging you, please do it!
I just finished watching the Rainforest Cafe video again! 🥹 Thank you
nice to see jarvis with ya
Peace love buccees
The Hemisphere Dancer was mistakenly shot at by the Jamaican government (as documented in the Jimmy Buffett song Jamaica Mistaica) and you can still see the bullet holes on display at City Walk Orlando!
I'm amazed that I didn't realize we had Margaritavilles stateside, though I've probably walked past like five of these.  I have seen them in the Caribbean, but they're always so packed that I've never gone in. Haha
This is so great. I've actually been to some of these places before (just not eaten at the Margaritaville), so a lot of the B roll is very familiar to me. I know you say that you headed out for the last time. But, let me remind you there is a certain Feudal Europe themed restaurant that's just begging for a similar road trip. And I know there aren't that many, but maybe you can supplement it by going to one Buc-ee's in every state (that there is a Buc-ee's).
The Rainforest cafe Nam flashbacks were gold
Screw Jimmy Buffet. He sued a small burger shack in Waikiki, Cheese Burger in Paradise, because he was too stupid to open his own restaurants before they did.
42:20 im sorry the employees warning u away from one of the dishes has me HOWLING💀
These trips are amazing! please do more!
Next year: hard Rock cafe
Eddy, no:(
Ok, but why 🤔
Eddy, as a long time fan, I am shocked and appalled by this Buc-ee’s slander. I thought you were a cool guy. I guess I was wrong though, because all cool guys like Buc-ee’s. I hope you’re happy because, unfortunately, you’ve made Buc-ee very sad.
you should be a bit ballsy and go the the 15 yellow deli's. you said Margariteville looks like a cult. the yellow deli is literally a cult
I liked it when the kid played Stinky Feet. :)
Welp 2 years in a row makes it a tradition. Looking forward to next year
God I love this series
YOU BEAT US TO IT! My roommate and I talked about doing this after your RFC video because I was named after a JB song.
Job's not done. You guys didn't go on the Margaritaville Cruise
EYYYY YOU DID THE THING. I'VE LIVED IN ARIZONA FOR 23 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER DONE THE THING!
Now y’all gotta do bubba gump
Margaritaville is a real place? I always thought it was a metaphor or something. 😵‍💫
Now do Chuck E. Cheese
we gotta send you somewhere else dude
EDDIE WHY? (keep doing it tho)
i love unwindulaxin with jenna buffet
watching this whole thing to see if he goes to the one in my state that i see sometimes but have never gone :P
The Tim Misny billboards in Ohio 💀💀
Why didn't ted share any of his pepsid? Wtf man
EAT AT EVERY SINGLE MC.DONALD’S  IN THE WORLD “ED” 🔥 🔥 💯
Next year, how about Bubba Gump. Finish that corner of MoA.
You missed a Margaritaville in Shreveport, Louisiana! Was hoping to see you guys stop in my hometown.
talk about being committed to the content. congrats my dude! this is ....strangely entertaining.
Can’t wait until next year when you guys go to all 152 Dave and Busters locations
i love watching these because it confirms my feelings of alienation and ennui I always get in chain restaurants, especially themed ones. Eddy's face of misery, tummy pain, and existential dread is a reflection of our souls.
Can't wait for the Hard Rock Café video lmao
This is the exact opposite of the rainforest because those restaurants were dying and margaritaville is thriving
I saw Eddie walking into Margaritaville in Universal City and I just didn't go up to him because he was with friends and I didn't want to bother him. edit: that was like over a year ago
Love this series! You gotta keep going. Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood!
Eddie no
Hey eddy ive noticed your tummy hurts quite often at least more than the other guys. Might wanna get that checked out.
I think I can explain what happened around 16:00, but it's a shot in the dark.   Jimmy Buffett had an entire BROADWAY JUKEBOX MUSICAL called Escape From Margaritaville. The plot is about a bartender from a tourist trap island falling in love with a tourist, and then suddenly a volcano starts to erupt. I think it might be a reference to that, cause you know, the volcano erupts and also it plays Margaritaville. Again, shot in the dark I know but its the only explanation.
Now every HARD ROCK CAFE
Eddy. It’s time to take this to next level.  It’s time to visit every Bubba Gump.
30:07  I remember going on the Cat in the Hat ride as a child. It WAS absolutely terrifying in a trippy way.  The moment you showed the Cat in the Hat spinning my memories got unlocked lmao.
not gonna lie, that was a very “texas” thing running into that guy twice. big state, but somehow small?
14:40 the pizza plex
"The day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea??" 😂 I mean yeah diarrhea will make you reflect on your life decisions
America looks so bad
HasanAbi living large
As a Syracuse local, everything there is depressing. When that Margaritaville has guests, it’s ALL retirees in Hawaiian shirts, not a single soul below 65 in sight.
Kind of like Adam Sandler visiting every Applebee's in the country
Ok, so are chain restaurants just better in Canada? Is that the lesson here?
Now try this but with Waffle House
Looking forward to hard rock next year
This is my favorite coming of age film
Doesn't really matter, but Biloxi in Mississippi is pronounced "bull-uck-see"
Nobody tell Eddy there are cheeseburger in paradise restaurants
you missed the one in bossier city louisiana
Final challenge, Hard Rock Cafe next year 👀😂😵‍💫
“I beat the child” -Eddie Burback 2023
Eddy Next Year: “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country.”
37 minutes in I was officially over eating at Margaritaville and I've never had it...
It's only a matter of time before he marathons every Hard Rock Cafe.
I thought there was a resort in tx? Ya might’ve missed one 💀
Sooo next year do we get a Cracker Barrel episode?
I'm so sorry you had to go to Florida for this. lmao EDIT: Hell yeah, Optimus Prime
The thing! I love it whenever we drive out of Tucson we try and stop there it’s so absurd and used to be much worse
As some one from southern Arizona, I’m so glad you stopped to see the atrocity that is the THING 😂 it’s definitely upgraded since I was a kid lmao
hory cow. this was amazing. can you do a golden corral national tour? 😅
Oh hey, my friends and I were at the mall of America a couple days ago and we were just talking about your rainforest cafe video
Yaaaas! I just rewatched the Rainforest Cafe video with the thought, hey, that was a year ago. I wonder…. Also no Margaritaville at Sea????
You should do the same thing with Tim Hortons in canada
Eddie gets Florida-pilled
Sooooo…. Bubba Gump next?
I love you for this
as an Ohioan the Tim Misny billboard made me lose it thank you for sharing in my personal hell of constant bald man jumpscare
oh fuck yeah, after rainforest cafe i was truly hoping you would do another. my prayers have been answered
Eddy... You were miserable the first time. You did it again?! What is wrong with you?
There's something about their cat and dog energy that makes these videos 20000x better
Final…until you decide to do this again for  another little known franchise visit.
I live in San Antonio and I can confirm that’s what it’s like passing rainforest cafe everytime.
I look forward to the hard rock cafe video next year
you should do it again next year but with mcdonalds
So so brave of you to continue on with a tummy ache Nothing is worse than the belly hurty
What could possibly finish this trilogy?
Giving a restaurant full of people the finger is pretty crazy. Like bro nobody knows you’re flipping off the sign… they just think you’re an asshole lol
Ok bro we get it
NOOOO EDDY DON'T GO INTO THE BACK OF SPENCERS NOOOOOOOO
I’m a Minnesota native, how have I literally never noticed the Margaritaville across from the Rainforest Cafe
I grew up with both parents and grandparents that are obsessed with jimmy buffet, and I have been to three of these locations personally. So glad you chose this as your next insane chain roadtrip, this is the content I needed. Hilarious as always Eddie (sorry this comment feels like a yelp review)
If you are planning on extending this series of trials next year, have you considered Eating at Every Medieval Times Castle? There are only like a dozen of them, which might make up for costing so dang much
ok now do Medievel Times
Love to hear y’all were so close to Chattanooga!
I recognize that Tim Misney billboard anywhere
please do the cheesecake factory next thank you . "there are too many to go to them all." sounds like quitters talk
Hey Eddie why did you skip the Margaritaville in Conroe Tx?
If Crissy's Margaritaville song isn't in this video I'm boycotting
49:04 oh hey that's the oasis I always stop at it's almost like YouTubers are real people or something
16:51 I really, really hate that those ducks are holding bright orange noses that protrude vertically from their duck bills.
Have you ever been to the Hard Rock Café?
Never heard of margaritaville, but after the masterpiece that was the rainforest Cafe trip, I had to click. What’s next: Hard Rock Cafe?
Can’t wait for the third adventure
I said this on Ted’s channel too but literally on Sunday I went to Margaritaville while on Vacation in Niagara Falls
Seeing where I live in an eddy burback video is so deeply unsettling, it's like seeing a ghost in my house or something
Yeah my Jamaican family could never figure out why Americans love Magaritaville
You should do this again next year but with Wendy's
What a great sequal! Can't wait for the end of the trilogy, "I Ate At Every Hard Rock Cafe"!
As someone from europe i never feel like im learning more about the united states than watching these eddy roadtrip videos like it feels like it's confirming that those things in american movies that seemed fake or exaggerated in american movies are just like that irl  I also have to say i really appreciate those bits where you explain what certain US specific things are for all of us who have no clue. Its nice not to be forgotten as audience!
Bubba Gump next year?
Oh god, not again...
if only jimmy buffet's cheeseburger in paradise were still open
I was watching the rainforest cafe vid when I saw this in the recommended and my first thought was "oh god not again"
stop
TIMESTAMPS  Jumpscare 0:29  Thicc Alien 9:07  5 star Spencer’s review 44:41 Tulsa, OK 53:08
I'm just a poor ole beach bum country boy wasting away in Florida barely making it (worth $ 500M ); Please keep buying my overpriced shit, thank you.
Rain is worth it for the trees.
Next year: Bubba Gump
First The Pistachio and now The Thing, I really appreciate Eddy experiencing more of the southwest US lore
I love Ted. Dude can have a miserable morning but will turn around and be cool because he's on a road trip and is just happy to be away from home
Up next: “I ate at every McDonald’s in the country”
Not me trying to think which restaurant he can do next and will make sure he comes back to the Mall of America
As I a Miamian, I can attest our city is always insane like the dude they ran into here. You probably could make a whole video about how weird Miami is.  Also been to the Atlanta one and can attest the people there are the nicest.
I had to pause this video in the middle and make myself a margarita.
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next!!!
this is more exciting than anything thats happened to me in the last year
Why
You mad lads. This was the best sequel to the Rainforet Cafe video.
Next up. Every buba gump shrimp
Big up to the folks at Margaritaville Atlanta
Why do you keep doing this to yourself
Jimmy Buffett: Tropics obsessed lunatic
In this episode, Eddy's escape to Margaritaville leads him to an unexpected spiral into alcoholism
using the netflix chef's table music to describe margaritaville is unhinged 10/10
What about the one in the US Virgin Islands? (Idk if you did or not, I did not watch the video)
i cant believe an employé told you not to get something and you didn’t get it. if i was on that journey i would have absolutely gotten it
Why do you subject yourself to this (content and being able to pay rent)?
As an Arizona native I’m so glad you showcased the single greatest museum in the world. “The Thing” fucking rules
If you ever want to make a local breweries roadtrip in Germany, hit me up😂
Next Season: Bubba Gump’s
FINISH THE TRILOGY COWARDS
I’ve never heard someone pronounce Biloxi like that. It got me every time
Is the logical continuation of this visiting every Hard Rock Cafe in America??
Release the feet cut
Can’t wait for the going to every Hard Rock Cafe in the country video
That museum has just been added to "the must visit" list
bruh, your liver?
Do every chuck and cheese next (bring a nephew or something)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The man the myth the legend is back! Gracing us with Margaritaville!!!!!!
literally thank you for creating such unique entertaining two videos super dope super creative you guys are awesome 🎉
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Now go to every Applebee's
The only good town In Mississippi
Eddie at this point, stop for my sake.
The sequel I didn't know I needed amazing work eddy
Hand grenades in NOLA, nice choice
Jokes on you, they just approved putting one in south lake tahoe
Eddy....why?
You're never allowed to post while I'm at work again
As someone with chronic stomach issues that are made worse with alcohol, the tummy ache arc was super compelling to me.
You're only doing 2? You're not going to make it a trilogy?
this has to be a yearly tradition at this point lmao
18:10 "We then paid the cheque" wait you haven't been paying?! D:
12:08 this made me laugh way too much
The jambalaya was steaming like that cuz they definitely microwaved it.
Great vid. Now do all the McDonalds.
Every olive garden in the country
I am 23 and had NO IDEA Jimmy buffet was a billionaire. I know a bunch of his songs but hotels, neighborhoods and restaurants? Dude built an empire off a catchy hook and some vibes!
Is everything ok? Who hurt you!?
I was getting worried that you guys wouldn't experience the Volcano Nachos. But my fears were subsided near the end.
11:50 it's not just cattle it's LONGHORNS BAYBEEE 🦅🦅 RAAAHHH TEXASS🦅🦅
Alright no messin’ around. Go to every Medieval Times next
I’m glad you have b roll of Tim Mitsny, Cleveland icon. You’ve earned the margaritaville crocs, guys.
Can't wait until next year when Eddy & Ted go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the country (and Canada)
Glad to see Syracuse NY getting some not so well deserved attention. The Margaritaville reflecting the city it resides in
margaritaville trip: eddy becomes an alcoholic
So.... Bubba Gump Shrimp Co next? Run, Eddy, Run!
What iconic people who served you food when the kitchen was closed, that was so dope.
THE SAGA CONTINUES
Do Bubba Gump’s next.
You should do Wendy's next year
I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or sincere about everything. Maybe a little of both? Is he having fun or not having fun? Does he like Margaritaville or not like Margaritaville?
Commenting for boosting, so hopefully this isn’t the last road trip
Lmao  I fucking knew the Upstate NY ones would be shit.  Welcome to upstate! We hate it here! lol
See you next year at Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Co!
Incredibly proud of Syracuse for being home to the worst Margaritaville
"I Jimmy'd too close to the sun" is my new favorite phrase
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next pls
note to self: US restaurant franchises are better in Canada
i’m so glad i got to meet you and ted at the rfc!!! i went there specifically because of the video, i had no idea y’all would be there! thanks for the pictures, and thank god i don’t have to keep this a secret anymore!!
As philosopher Eric Cartman once said, “f**k Jimmy buffet” 🫡
Return of the king Great video can't wait to see how far you drive next year
It's pronounced Biluxi!
No mention of Parrotheads is wild. Like he has an entire active fandom lol
Ted in the THING shirt made me so happy
We had a “cheeseburger in paradise” open in our town (quite a long time ago now) and I knew the owner… apparently the corporation was awful to work with. They had great live music and then were told they couldn’t do that anymore (this was long before COVID). It seemed like everything that the owner did to make the restaurant stand out from other in the area corporate would shut down. The business obviously went under eventually and the whole thing felt a bit shady. Just thought I would share.
23:11 WTFFF IS THAT????
I love your road trip videos. If you wanna do this a third time my suggestion is dicks last resort. There’s 13 across the us. Get insulted by your waiters the whole time.
can't wait for next year's trip
No. Fucking. Way. I come home from work to this?
Can't wait until next year when he visits all 1,569 Applebee's
next year you two should do all the t-rex cafes
I hope you make enough from this video for the mental health support I'm sure you'll need to get over this ordeal. Also thank you for your service, sir.
bih-LUCK-see not bih-LOCK-see
Every time I see the map I just see a bunch of Samus Arans and it makes me think that Nintendo should make a chain of Metroid themed restaurants.
Omg! I work at riverspirit casino! I actually live ten minutes away right down the street. Absolutely crazy seeing you in my hometown :,)
It begins. Again.
pigeon forge is a soulless disgusting town. I hate it. I hate it so much. Im glad the margaritaville reflected that
DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT DO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP NEXT
Your suffering brings us joy Eddy, thank you 🥰
K now do every McDonalds
the madman did it again!
No way he called Biloxi, Bill Oxy
The editing on this is great
cool skunk eddy
I have no words Eddy.   Except...        what a masterpiece
Seeing this on my home page brought unfathomable excitement, glee even. Leaping with joy, though only in my mind’s garden, of course, for my entire physical body has locked in to bare witness.
Free feet pics???? In this economy?!
Jokes on you Eddy, we're all here for the mustache
I feel like every time I see eddy his beautiful mustache gets bigger
This is good
Why was this so entertaining....
Truly an incredible allegory about religious guilt
Didn't even watch yet and already know this is gonna be fuckin GOLDEN
I haven't lived in the US in eight years now, but this is what I remember life in America being: one chain restaurant after another, and the slow loss of my sanity. So thank you for reminding me.
Are you some kind of masochist Why do you do this to yourself  Cryin
Ted can't keep getting away with this!
This is modern flagellation. take care of yourself, buddy🍔
the margaritaville employees are losing their minds right now
Should’ve asked Pepto to sponsor y’all 🤣🤣
ur so bold
Eddy you are a bad person for showing the thing. it is supposed to be a well kept secret you monster. I will never forgive you. Unsubbed.
Eddy, Why? 😭😂
I’m so ignorant I thought Margaritavile was a Bahamian restaurant 😭😭😭😭
teddy burback
Can’t wait for next year’s video, “I ate at every McDonald’s in the country”
Ok, what's the next restaurant road trip? Wahlburgers, Hard Rock Cafe, Frickers, Halo Burger, Bar Rescue bars that are still open, Bubba Gump Shrimp.
That shot through the Amtrak's green-tinted windows at Chicago's view flooded me with nostalgia, like a huge total wave of nostalgia!
Any reason why the Osage Beach, MO location was omitted?
Man I just can’t get enough of these little guys in a little car eating little meals
Can you go to mcdonalds next
"The only people that like Jimmy Buffett are frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the south." And Eddie
Eggy didnt you do dis ready
HardRock Cafe next year?
EDDIE I WAS AT DISNEY SPRINGS YESTERDAY AND I LIVE IN PA AND SPEND PART OF THE SUMMER IN FLORIDA
this is the Americana I crave
Just wait until he finds out about the Margaritaville musical
theres a latitude margaritaville where i live in sc that i thought youd go to but you didnt </3 to be fair its like a neighborhood and not a restaurant so i realized that makes sense
Buffalo Poutine sounds great
Eddie was in Mississippi and i didnt get to meet him:( thats an absolutely heartbreaking:(((
Next year you should do "eating ar every McDonald's in the US and Canada" 😂. That should take about e year to film atleast
So uhhhh what's next? Bubba Gump? Hard Rock?
"For this last time"....ya sure eddy. Whatever you say🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It would’ve been really funny if this video was a complete reverse of the rainforest cafe one where you’re loving every second of it and Ted is going through his personal hell
I'm sorry you had to go to Cleveland
im predicting they go to every bubba gump next year
This would make Justin McElroy proud.
The Detour for The Thing was 100% worth it.
DUDE okay the staff at the Atlanta Margaritaville is amazing, I'm glad you had the same positive experience I had with them last year
This is the bad boys 2 of Eddie burback videos
Lol it’s pronounced  “bil-uxi”  So cool you came to Mississippi though!
HARDROCK CAFE. HARDROCK CAFE!
9:05 The alternate reality version of NSP's Dinosaur Laser Fight
Now go to every McDonald’s in the country
PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAD THE KEY LIME PIE IN KEY WEST
Why does he keep doing this to himself
i was horrified after you did this once. doing it twice should quality you for some kind of award for bravery and resilience
Idk why it was so cool for me to see the margaritaville in Destin still kicking, i grew up there and haven't been back to Destin in like 7ish years? it was weird seeing the boardwalk that my mom used to work on just casually in a youtube video lol. Passed by that margaritaville about a billion times but never once entered, child me used to think it was an adult club
I think Bubba Gump's Shrimp is next.
Thanks I learned a lot about Jimmy and his billion dollar vacation cult.
Be careful, last time you uploaded a video similar to this Tednivison completely stole it
As a key west local I feel like this is my Super Bowl lmao
Wooooo here we go again!
why is no one talking about the thing museum???? if i saw that shit i woulda died😭
I feel like this is Caitlyn Rae's dream roadtrip
Well ed, there was a margaritaville in Jurassic World so you didn't quite make it, nice try though!
Thank you for making this sacrifice king
The one by my apartment (Cleveland) is so trash it’s sad. I don’t know how it affords to stay open
26:37 play at 0.25x speed to see slight glimpse of the underside of eddy feet
Welp, see you next year at Hard Rock Cafe
Please make this an anual event
This man’s liver is screaming
Does PATREON get the full toe version?
Gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next there’s like 30 of them lol
You, are obsessed by association
Suggestions for part 3:  Hard Rock Cafe  Planet Hollywood Hello Kitty Cafe
Hard Rock Café next! 35 locations LET'S GOOOOO!!!!
I’m sorry to tell you this Eddy but you missed the Margaritaville in Conroe, Texas…..it’s on Lake Conroe and a resort tho so….that’s nice. If you want I’ll have my husband take me and give you my opinion. 😂
You don’t understand the horrors of the Tim Misny billboards around Cleveland
I can not like this enough! I am from The Netherlands and have no clue about the restaurants, Jimmy who?, yet I am living for these tours.😂❤
This man must have so much money! He's going to every restaurant in the US and Canada! That's insane!
But did he bowl a perfect game.
Just wanna add buffet has a song about named Jamaica Mistaka about his plane getting shot at by the Jamaican government because they were assumed to be drug runners
Shortly after my brother came back from his 16 month deployment in Iraq in 2007, we met up for dinner at Margaritaville in Orlando at City Walk. It was a great night until the volcano alert went off and he then jumped over the table and hid behind the bar because of a PTSD flashback. Burger was alright but nothing special. This is a very true story that happend
40:58 the jimmy buffet bio book being labeled as fiction sent me for some reason lol
Dude I have no idea what it is bout these videos but this and your rainforest cafe video are so fun to watch. They’re actually so well paced!
What a mad lad
Every McDonald's in north America when?
cant belive you didnt visit the Margaritaville senior living community in Florida
thank you for the mental sacrifice bc this content is so hilarious its like crack to me. i think ive watched ur rainforest cafe video like 50 times
eddy if only you got to experience the “hurricane” that happens about every hour in the myrtle beach location. i used to get so excited as a kid when the alarms would go off
Eddy suffering for our amusement? Ah yes, exquisite content once again
Okay, thank you for going to The Thing. I live near the signs and just never had the inclination to go 😂😂 so now I know. Thanks!
I was dying when the green M&M gave that creepy kiss 😭😆
I like to have videos in the background while I work. I just finished an incredible two hour video about the history of research on the K-PG extinction, science communication, and the widespread image of dinosaurs and pop science as a whole (the video is "The Mass Extinction Debates: A Science Communication Odyssey," by the way). I started this immediately after and got some severe fuckin whiplash from the aliens vs dinos museum
As someone from and currently living in Syracuse. It did not surprise me that it was home to the shittiest of all margaritavilles 😂
Ain’t no way I missed them again
Love to see essentially the shining margarita style
Go to all the Hooters next
You played right into Jimmy's hands. His sun bleached trap.
YESSS LETS GOO IM HERE FOR THIS!!! 🎉 2nd tiiime the Rainforest one was amazing too ahah  Lmfao i havent been to a margaritaville forever ahah  Nah i agree i love my fl home but the rain can be crazy here at times lol! But the vids in Florida caught it perfectly, gosh i loved this entire video 🎉
this video is insane
😂 I first watched your video on the rain forest cafe, now I watched them in reverse and watched saw Teds video before I saw this one. The circle is complete.
You could really just start calling these videos "proof I hate my butthole" and the title would work all the same.
Lot of feet references in this one…
as someone who is at destiny USA semi-frequently I am so shocked to see that the margaritaville there was actually open lmao
Eddy in 2030: I ate at every McDonald's in the Country
The stockholm syndrome taking effect at 21:58
I didn't know that Rainforest Café could give you Stockholm syndrome
High art
As a Minnesotan I’m glad MOA was the one to break you each trip, it feels semi like an honor.
This video made me realize I’ve been pronouncing ‘buc-ees’ incredibly wrong, I have made a horrible mistake
Now do every macdonalds in the country
The thing used to be a real skeleton way back in the day but it was of a Native American women and there was protest about having her skeleton on display
This sounds like Ted is having an affair
Bubba Gump Shrimp is the logical final piece of this strange, beautiful, niche-themed-American-chain-restaurant triforce 🦐
My mom works at margaritaville in Georgia
I know why I like these videos now. It's as if you're the dad on a family trip going alone on the trip. No annoying kids or angsty teenagers in the back.
I like mine with lettuce and tomatoe Heinze 57 and french fried potatoes....
No joke one of my most anticipated sequels ever
Syracuse being the worst is the least surprising thing ive heard all day
next year eddy & ted go to every medieval times in the country ???
I think Eddy just likes themed restaurants.
WHY WOULD YOU TOO DO THIS TO YOURSELF, WHY???
36:55 Ted with the "The Thing" shirt 😂
YUP
Just as I was thinking that all these Margaritavilles were giving Scientology vibes, that volcano sealed the deal. David Miscavige is gonna want a word with Jimmy Buffet
The series we never knew we wanted, but now we need this.
So hard rock cafe next?
waiting in anticipation for all 23 bubba gump shrimp co. locations next summer!
It's great that I can look forward to one of these videos once every year.
Now do Bubba Gump lol
Okay I really hope somebody is working quickly to archive this video before it gets taken down, there's no way *they* are going to let a recording like this stay up for long, all this footage of *THE THING* and what it *is*
Now watch as he does Plant Hollywood next year and finally looses it
dick's last resort next? 👀
23:11 “Narely”? You messed up bro
Lmao the chefs table theme is adding
DO OLD COUNTRY BUFFET OR GOLDEN CORRAL NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You skipped the Margaritaville cruise 😬😬😬
As someone who lives around Syracuse, thank you for denouncing the terrible ass Margaritaville at Destiny USA. It’s almost as bad as the frequent shootings/stabbings that happen there!
This is disturbing in so many ways. But thank you for doing this for us.
Surprised you didn't stop at the Biden Welcome Center again for old time's sake. I guess you can do that next year when you inevitably go on a road trip to all of America's Bubba Gumps or something
What about the RV resorts?
Eddy knowing “Schlatt” is one of the craziest things to go unexplained on this channel   Especially considering what “schlatt” did in ‘99
Whats the classical song in the beginning called
jimmy is love. jimmy is life.
As someone from San Antonio, thank you for saying nice things about our city i really do appreciate it. But also if you find yourself in town again please eat somewhere nice
im gonna be honest i watched the rainforest video for the first time yesterday and now this is here...
Nice one deep edward
It’s weird to see this when I went to a Margaritaville for the very first time a week ago, I didn’t know about the Jimmy buffet lore behind it lol  Oh shit he sat at the table I did in the Miami location
Something that would be nice in a future video like this is keep tracking of all the menu prices. It would be interesting to see how dramatically different prices are between states or if at all for a chain like this.
okay but every applebees in america?
Finally someone brave enough to do this
These road trip videos are some of the absolute best on YouTube. Hope your stomach keeps up the good fight.
Gonna be honest, watching this video also made my tummy hurty
not the part 2 we deserved, but the part 2 that we needed
He should do "Hard Rock Café"  now
Did I skip over it or did he forget Michigan? There’s one in the Wayne county airport
In one year: I ate at every Bubba Gumps in the country
As someone who lives in las cruces, this is the second time eddy has fallen for a billboard advertising something stupid in our town
You mad man…
Literally woke up my fiancée to tell her "Hey honey you have to wake up, there's a new Eddy Burback goes to every niche chain restaurant in America but it's actually every niche restaurant in America and Canada."   And she said "I don't want to be engaged to you anymore. I want to marry you RIGHT NOW! I need to be married to a man who understands my needs and wants so well that he would wake me up for the Eddy Burback goes to Margaritaville video."  and that's how I got married
You crazy son of a bitch, you did it again.
Bubba Gump next plz
please tell me you went to the hand grenade bar in New Orleans because of Bar Rescue
So what’s next year’s road trip?
Great! Now do every bubba gump in America
I feel like Ted feeds off of Eddy's negative energy on these trips lmao. Like he hated it when Eddy was having fun, but as Eddy sank deeper into suffering, Ted's mood lifted 😂
I’m waiting for the day they open up a Margaritaville in Guyana
3:03 I thought I was being flipped off by a Minion there for a moment..
Omg stop because why was I waiting on another one of these videos
My favourite part is always Ted gaslighting himself and falling into a tragic loop of endless suffering, it felt so immersive..   Almost like I’ve been gaslighting myself this whole time, entering a paradox of endless suffering and seeing Ted In the corner talking to himself
7:12 - for the second and “””final””” time
You really have done more for your country than anyone else
Eddie skipped a Margaritaville in Lake Conroe. What a cheat, no wonder people call him Eddie Nine Pins
The shrimp at 31:30 is absolutely vile 😂
I can’t wait for them to do Bubba Gump Shrimp next year
How he dodged the Niagara Falls Rainforest Cafe is beyond me. I'm pretty sure if Eddy saw any more they would have stolen his soul
Eddy you were so brave about your tummy aches
i love you eddie but this does not compare to the greatest of the rainforest cafe
these are freaking great. i ALMOST, not really, wish i hadn't quit so i might run into you lol please try others
Bro you have to go to dollywood. I grew up gowing there and it's hilarious. Would make a great video. They have old men in what look like zoo displays blowing glass and weird shit like that. Also there's holiness people all around in what look like pilgrim outfits and they never wear deodorant.  Alluring lmao
Surely, it has to be Bubba Gump for the next tour.
great video can’t wait for next years
Eddy boy I just now saw that this was uploaded 😼 i expect there to be insults about pigeon forge like there were in ted’s
hey buddy, what about the margaritaville in Palm Springs?
This video is 100% pure Randy Marsh energy.
When I was a kid my favorite restaurant was Cheese Burger in Paradise and it’s gone under since then 😭
I'm pretty sure there used to be one in Virginia (or West Virginia) somewhere. I ate at one while on one of my dad's business trips. It was nowhere near water or an attraction of any kind
Next summer they should do all the Hard Rock Cafes
Okay but all jokes aside I just fucking love this. This my fav YouTube video of the entire summer. I laughed, I winced and my tummy churned in sympathy. Just perfection. Thank you for shaving years off your livers life span for us.
I can't believe I didn't know who Jimmy Buffett was an hour ago
haha that's crazy, you should eat at my house next.
Omfg YESSSSS
This feels like it’s on the level of Hercules 12 labors.
This made me understand something about the USA I never understood before. I have never been there. I understand now. I understand everything. Yet it is beyond my wildest imagination. There are resorts themed after restaurants themed after B-list celebrities I have never heard of. There are GIGANTIC plates with weirdly yellow melted cheese and nachos. Those are appetizers. I see now. I understand. I don't think I have to visit America, this video was enough. Thank you.
Can’t wait till he does this again, he says it’s the final one but I don’t believe it
You cant fathom the exitement i felt seeing this title and thumbnail! (The only knowledge i have of jimmy buffet and margaritaville is from bmbmam)
Do "I ate at every Wetherspoons in the UK" next
Dude did more in one trip than most of the people I know have done in their whole life.
lol @ the way you say Biloxi. Also it didn’t fail as a casino, hurricane Katrina washed the building away.
next video idea all bush gardens, with a stop at dolly wood
You forgot the one in South Padre Island :/
52:26  aaëyægh fukdah cOUMON
Alright, now go to every applebees in the country
Welcome to Atlanta 😂😂
Hard Rock Cafe has 34 locations in the US!
You’re an inspiration to us all. 🫡
seeing Eddy suffer at the Mall of America, I place I live 20 minutes from, is killing me because true Minnesotans also hate the Mall of America
next time u guys do this PLEASE film the conversation where u decide which chain to go to
Eddy not again
28:35 made me laugh out loud
This is a great comedy duo. The food doesn't matter this could be a trip down Rt 66 trying all the fast food or buying all the fireworks in June and July!
28:58 is that in Epcot or Seaworld?
The rainforest cafe, ptsd killed me lmao
Sooooooo... Bubba Gump next?
Too bad you missed the margaritaville at Osage Beach in Missouri, it’s an interesting one
I can see it now "I rode every ride at Dollyworld in the country" July 2024
It's Time.
how are you going to be named buffet, open a bunch of restaurants, and none of them are a buffet.
NO EDDY NO
You should go to every  McDonald’s in the country
I am so glad you tortured yourselves again! This is definitely one of my favourite genres: extensive, expensive, definitely not worthwhile and strangely appealing to do myself
Rainforest Cafe walked so Margaritaville could run.
I like the part where he goes to Margarittaville
Can’t wait for next years video when y’all do all the hard rock cafe’s 😅
Picturing some random child walking up to play stinky feet and the two of you just standing in silence as you absolutely smoke them is a really fun time
I live near the Mall of America... Perhaps I should do a RFC/Marg double feature in your honor.
I love these videos so much. I'd totally be done for yearly roadtrip videos that descend into madness
If you want to embody your inner Jimmy, show us them feetsies brah
Glad you enjoyed your time in Cleveland lol
This feels like watching someone take a court-appointed anger management program
You're like Gandalf, always turning up out of nowhere to do the impossible, right when we need you ❤
Y’all didn’t hit bossier city
The perfect margarita is 100% alcohol 😂
I think Ted just likes liminal spaces. The more a Margaritaville looks like it resides in a weird tear in reality, the more he enjoys it.
well done. now do the margaritaville at sea!
I have a rainforest cafe and a margaritaville in my city. Never realized I was so blessed
Confirmed:     Next one Dollywood
The Rainforest PTSD should not be as funny as it is
Do McDonald's
Ain’t no way they aren’t having an affair with each other 😮
46:31 for anyone who hasn't lived in Ohio, that's Tim Misney on the billboard. For the last several years, Tim has been placing eyes and ears all over the roads across Ohio, and if he sees someone cause an auto accident, the eyes shoot lasers that destroy all US currency inside you pocket.
Day made!
so bubba gump shrimp is next Right?
Not me watching the whole video waiting for Cleveland and it being 20 seconds long 😅
I have the faint memory of eating popcorn shrimp, vibing out to Margarittaville on loop as a child at a Margaritaville in southern VA, on a weird road between the trailer park on my school bus route and a shopping center with a blockbuster, nowhere near the ocean in a state that borders the ocean I guess that location closed, or I imagined the whole thing because I can't find any proof it existed Either way, thank you for imparting your existential crisis onto me on a Thursday morning
Now do every Dunkin’ Donuts…..
eddy my brother LOVED the cat in the hat ride when he was little so dont be trash talking it
this felt like a really self-aware coming of age movie
Why didn’t go on the margaritaville cruise ????
What restaurant will it be next year?
oh my god i saw the clip from pistachioland i need to know if y’all tried to the pistachio ice cream
You're my new favorite travel vlogger
God damnit Eddie
Next year is gonna be ROUGH when he goes to all 468 chuck e cheese’s in the us
I work as a line cook at the one in cleveland hope you enjoyed
So Bubba Gump's is gonna be the finale of this trilogy, right?
Why did you skip the Atlanta Margaritaville?
I think you missed the Margaritaville in Bossier City, LA lol
Human suffering is funny, especially when self inflicted!!!
Canada's the best, confirmed.
this is my favorite cinematic universe
Eddy I beg you, if you ever go on another road trip take some digestive enzymes with you.
next: do all mcdonald's!
Someone call Justin McElroy, we need him to follow in Eddie's footsteps
Ok, I've gotta see Ted's perspective now.
22:00 IVE SEEN THAT GUY!!! Normally he’s doing handstands and the worm at a crosswalk by a torso statue in front of a pseudo-outdoor mall in Brickell a few blocks from the metro station.
thanks for eating at my hometown location of Syracuse NY and absolutely nailing the entire atmosphere in about 30 seconds
I'm only 7 mins in, but I'm hoping there's no besmirching of Newark, DE this time. I don't think we've recovered from the last time yet.
eddy’s experience in the mall of america is very similar to mine except i ate at the buffalo wild wings and then absolutely blew up a stall.
This was easier, they have way better food then the rain forest cafe lol😂
now do cheesecake factory.  you might actually die.  edit: lol there are 211 of them
When sweatshirts restock??
Next time he will have to go to every Old Spaghetti Factory, because I want to see him go to the West Edmonton Mall which I believe is still one of the biggest malls in the world, despite being in the saddest place on earth after Winnipeg.
Sponsor is ineligible to florida residents 😭 What did we do to you SoFi..
I would appreciate if you did every American girl doll cafe next
Speaking for all Jimmys, don’t try and be like us. Because we are trying to be like you
So… every hard rock in the WORLD?
I can’t wait for 20 years from now when Eddy opens a chain of restaurants, my kids will tour the nation eating at every Burback Burbger
Here we go again.
Jimmy's actual secret, a shot of pepto bismol after every meal!
I hate when people say "Oh that rains not bad, where I'm from etc etc" because when it rains in places that don't usually get rain, it causes the oil in the road to rise up and make the road way more dangerous. It's objectively more dangerous to drive in LA rain than Seattle rain.
Biloxi is pronounced bilucksy, not bilocksy
Waiting for the "We visited every Subway in the country" video
the "Oh, shit! Coolest motherfuckers on the planet" was gold
THE LONG AWAITED SEQUAL
One of these chains is going to reach out to you and ask you to become a regional manager for brand consistency, or some shit. Is that the life you want for yourself? lol
why tf do none of these go anywhere near SF or PNW??
47:11 coolest
🍿
only random long video i'll fully watch
I loved the rainforest cafe video, so I already this is gonna be a banger.
Im surprised you didnt get mercury poisoning from eating so much seafood.
Missed the one on Bolivar Peninsula, Texas 😅
Listen. Listen.....Listen. I need you to understand that he is not joking about the Cat in the Hat ride. That wasn't a bit. That ride is melting, and it's better than any of their haunted houses for Halloween Horror Nights.
No way next year they do a Bubba Gump Road-trip
So, Bubba Gump Shrimp next year or what?
So Hard Rock Cafes next summer?
Watching this while I work and ofc the first thing I see when I look over is the green M&M acting sus as hell 😂
You know, every iconic sequel sets the stage for a legendary trilogy
Rainforest Cafe in July of 2022: why the fuck did our sales spike so much last month? Margaritaville in July of 2023: why the fuck did our sales spike so much last month?
They must complete the trilogy of themed american restaurants now and do a hard rock cafe road trip
“Hey I’ve seen this one before! It’s a classic!” “What do you mean? It’s brand new.”
Thank you for pronouncing New Orleans right
i live near Syracuse so I'm proud to be near one of the worst margaritavilles in the us of a
Eddie…….. are you okay??
Can't wait until next year's road trip video when Eddy visits every McDonald's in the country
Girl for new orleans ya coulda just said you wanted to make sure your phone made it to the next margaritaville!!
@eddyburback what suburb are you from?
mofos in flordia really like jimmy buffet (im mofos)
Finally, i get to see Eddy suffering on a road trip again!
Bladerunner vibes
I'm genuinely shocked you did this for a second time lmao
Video of the year im calling it right now!!
Aw come on, go to Dollywood!
eddy orders “JIMMY’S JAMMIN’ JAMBALAYA” in minnesota, one of the places in the U.S that is very different from the origins of the dish
Definitely caught me off guard with the blurred feet. 🤣
Eddie, go to every Dicks Last Resort in America
This is a better sequel than most I’ve seen in theaters in recent years. Full character arcs with a different take than the first video, appropriate references from the first video too, and fan favorite familiar faces featured. Bravo!
Can you do every McDonald's next?
You should do Cheesecake Factory and Hard Rock Cafe next!
You should have gone to the one in Mexico.
go to every mcdonalds in america
Eddy... Why...
Love the video but, how dare you disrespect the all mighty buc-ees. I will give you points for pronouncing it correctly tho
the alien museum was a WILD turn
Eddy freaking out in Buccees is amazing! I love Texas, come on back, y'all.
Rainforest Cafe was one of my favorite videos of all time. So to be blessed with another? You’re the GOAT Eddie. ❤️
Does he ever say Margaritameal? Because if he doesn’t I will be sad at such a great missed opportunity
Do every McDonalds in America.
If you were going to rent a car anyway, wouldn't it have been significantly cheaper to throw your stuff in the back of a hatchback or something
There were a lot more Justin Bieber references than I anticipated
OH SHIII, COOLEST MFRRRS ON THE PLANET RIGHT HERE😎😤
I need to know how the order of the Margaritaville's was decided. Was it deliberately front-loaded with the high rated ones near the beach? Was the direction of the loop decided specifically so that the one in Vegas was last? Was there any thought to doing a "one-way" rental to just zig-zag to completion? These questions will keep me up at night.
I can't wait for next year when you and Ted go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp Company location in the US and Canada. The trifecta will really put a great ending to this adventure!
So are the feet on the Patreon or what? Asking for a friend
SO sad I didn't get to see you in Biloxi, MS - there's been TWO Margaritaville casinos in my city hahahaha
truly a masterpiece thank you for this video
That was such a certified Atlanta moment
The fact that not one of these locations had a Buffet buffet disappoints me immeasurably.
I love these videos, should visit the Margaritaville in Puerto Rico and the one here in the USVI!
54:20 dog :D
Fun fact: Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritraville was where I had my very first margarita. I nervously asked the bartender what he recommended. He asked, “How strong do you like ‘em?” For some reason I blurted out, “real strong.” I knew I’d fucked up when he poured “The Perfect Margarita.” I proceeded to take the first sip and WOW it was not good. Tasted like straight tequila. I tried my best to drink it so I didn’t waste my money but I ended up puking in the bathroom. Overall I took it as a learning experience, no more perfect margaritas from Jimmy.
@20:19 I’m from Florida, and the rain is literally ALWAYS a big deal
Why?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS :D
I though you learned your lesson with rainforest cafe.
no eddy please make this a yearly tradition please oh please you could do Medieval Times or Planet Hollywood or Dixie Stampede or just go insane and do Hard Rock Cafe
"i went to every restaurant in the country"
Cheesecake Factory next?
You goddamned madman.
Wow! I am going to watch this video.
imma be honest i didn't know Margaritaville was an actual place until I saw that one episode of Jury Duty
This is the best day of my life. Thank you for your service.
Instead of Heroes Harbor you should have called it Broadway at the beach. Never heard anyone call it heroes harbor.
Hitting standstill traffic on the way to Atlanta is the most Atlanta thing to happen lol
Eddy this means you came to my city and you didn't even tell me smh my head my head
im eating my lunch and i burped at the same time as jimmy...
Looking forward to 2024's " I ate a double cheeseburger at every McDonald's in the Country "
Wait what about the one in palm springs???
We need a third
Eddy what have you done.
I hear Jimmy Buffett… and I’m all in
Hey good news san deigo is opening a margaritaville. Only a few hour drive.
I feel hung over with a stomach ache after watching this. Very satisfying.
OH NO NOT AGAIN
I live in PCB I’m pissed I didn’t run into you guys
Ya know, there are ONLY 37 Joe's Crab Shacks... Just throwing it out there.
I watched the Rain Forrest Café last year and loved the idea. I just recently rewatched it with my girlfriend and we literally enjoyed the content, but were slightly amiss when it was over as we feel we got to know you and Ted kinda a little bit. We also watched his video as well. When I saw this today I immediately became excited. Poured myself a cup of coffee, and I thought about waiting to watch it with my girlfriend but said to myself......NAH I'll just watch it twice.   I love taking road trips and traveling. I'm actually thinking about buying a small camper to tow so I can have a bit of more comfort and not have to shell out for hotels every night. I'm myself thinking of doing something like you guys but a different restaurant chain. Don't worry I'm not trying to steal your idea. No desire to create content.  But I'd like to say. I love planning road trips and making my trips unique to what people typically do when they go on a trip. Like going to ever Rain Forrest Cafe for example. If you guys ever need a suggestion or help planning a trip, I'm more then willing to help out with very limited to no real desire to be apart of the content or to even be paid.   Anyways, Love this concept and I hope you do another one next year!
LMAO THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MEMES 16:07
You can’t end at Margaritaville when Bubba Gump’s is ready and waiting
Bro's gonna eat everywhere in 3 months
Eddy will forever be the Guy that ate at every X Restaurant. I mean... that should occupy him for a few years lol. Cannot wait to watch.
So cool to see my two favorite YouTubers hanging out in pigeon forge, the county where I live
What a trooper. Now go to all the hard rock cafes in the world
not again
Again Eddie?
Hoping this continues to be an annual series
THE CENSORED DAWGS
Now you should go to every buck-ee’s in the US
Wait yall were here in Georgia and you didnt come to the Margaritaville waterpark 45 min north of Atlanta? They have a restaurant and bar AND its a waterpark!!
You missed a resort in Shreveport, LA.  That one has decent Asian food.
didn't plan for the ATL traffic :(
Hey, mustache, wtf about Jacksonville, Fl.
Margaritaville Resort in Florida was honestly a really pretty location (sans the construction that was literally happening to hotel rooms around ours which made it look like nobody was supposed to stay there yet), and the restaurant in Citywalk had a pretty decent burger. And yeah, the Lone Palm bar's plane is Jimmy's actual plane :D  I'm glad Eddy agrees that Cat in the Hat is terrifying. Even when it's not broken it's insane.
Now do Medieval Times
The mad lad is at it again
Loved your Blade Runner moment 😂😂
the one in buluxee is awesome
Eddy, Jacksonville, Fl
Next year gotta do hard rock
Lol not this again lol
I paused on a frame of the stinky feet game without thinking as my mom walked in and ...wow, it's impressive how much harder it was to explain that than it would be to explain porn
wait wait wait wait  where's Margaritaville Resort Casino in Bossier City, Louisiana? gotta do this all again from day 1.
Fear and loathing in Margaritaville
Now THIS is what people want in a sequel
As a person who lives in Syracuse I can’t imagine wanting to go to the margaritaville at Destiny.   Literally every time I walk by it’s nearly empty and even then the only people are are boomers and such.   Still nice to know you came to our shitty lil city in the middle of NY, love seeing it pop up in videos and movies.
Jacksonville, Fl. Eddy.
Cant wait for next years runs for the Hard Rock Cafe
Now do every chuck e cheese please
Your SoCal is showing, fear of driving in the rain~~ 💖⛈️💖
You missed the one in Houston tho
I have a plush manatee from the Nashville location her name is Stella pearl
36:56 this was the first thing that Ted said this video
I love watching your videos! Your humor is great! Please keep making videos!! Have you thought about doing other restaurants?
"not some weird cult thing, it's what can fix me" said everyone who's ever joined a cult.
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE EDDIE!
Can’t wait for next years trip as Eddy and Ted go to Every Hard Rock Cafe in the country (and Canada) 😂
Not me googling "rare chain restaurants" to suggest another roadtrip simply because these are my favorite videos. 🤣🤦‍♀️
Seeing Eddy in my hometown and in one of my favorite places to go as a kid made me really happy! Ty for the PCB shout out Eddy!
Aw shit, here we go again
Why would you do this to yourself. You’re taking months of not years off your life
Now you need to go to all the Medieval Times.
Insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting different results
WHAT ABOUT THE 1 IN CAPITOLA??
Looking forward to the absolute carnage of a Hard Rock Cafe roadtrip next year
Haven’t been this happy instantly when I open up this app in awhile, just rewatched the rain forest cafe bud yesterday and was brightly surprised by this post :) love u eddy
I remember there being one in the airport at San Juan PR but I guess it's closed or you didn't want to take the plane ride.
I can't wait for the Hard Rock Cafe next lol
Now do McDonald’s
The idea of you making two of these videos within a year is unthinkable. You deserve national recognition for these two marvels of industry and spirit
Just think, wwjd. Ahem *What would Jimmy do?* 🙌🙏
Didn’t watch the full video yet but I know you had to go to my home town in ohio and I’m sorry
THE THING? Used to be like a museum about ancient torture methods, I visited it in about 2004?? So I’m glad to see they’ve updated their story line
poor manatee
How can Eddy be so cute when he looks a generic Pixar Dad?
Can't wait to watch Ted's video after this to see the pieces of his storyline sprinkled troughout this video pay off
What if: a supergroup consisting of Jimmy Buffet and the surviving members of Sublime.
Time to do Bubba Gump Shrimp, stache boy!
Eddie nooo
So the one you guys should check out is the one in Mexico! You can get Watermelon slices with Jell-O shots in them. Awesome video, man!
JOIN THE JIMMY CULT!!!!! DO IT!!!!
56:00 I need another story with this exact dynamic.
Beautiful. Great day to wear my citrus themed button up polo and day drink while watching
OK Eddy, next up it's time for every Hard Rock Cafe in the US & Canada!
Next, every McDonalds in the US and Canada!
time for every Applebee's
Next year. "I ate at every Medieval Times in the Country"
Next up:  Hardrock Cafe!!
I found it funny they made a restaurant chain off a song that I always interpreted to be a deeply sad song about a guy getting drunk on the beach to bury his pain over a woman
Can't wait for next year's restaurant trip!
17:54 $25.50 for that? bruh
There’s a margarita ville hotel here in Jacksonville Florida too but for some reason has a Landshark grille in it instead of the margaritaville restaurant, very interesting
This is the real Jimmy Buffet here, I’m proud of you boys.
True story, I ordered Jimmy's Jammin Jambalaya at the Universal Orlando restaurant and was also warned against it.
the day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?
Just waiting for Jarvis to calculate the environmental impact of this road trip
These videos are my religion
Why do I love these videos..  whats planned for next year?
How nice of you to take Danny Gonzalez to Margaritaville twice
I need a chain of restaurants by Cheech and Chong
Why did you skip Jacksonville Beach Eddy??????
Saw the title and immediately just said "Eddy...no"
are medieval times next?
I just wish Justin McElroy was with Eddy on this glorious journey
13:55 blessed encounter
Seamless merch drop ;)
You gotta do the margaritaville cruise from hell…. The only way it’s good is if your wasted on the expensive mediocre margaritas the whole time. LoL. 😂
The sequel we never knew we needed
did i miss it or did he not go to the one in jacksonville, fl??
one of few times when the sequel is better than the first part
"the day you had self reflection is the day you had diarrhea?!"
As someone who lives in Syracuse, I’m sorry our Margaritaville sucks 🫡
Imagine meeting a YouTuber you like while he’s on an insane road trip *twice*
So Eddy, Bubba Gumps next?
Is this the Denim guy?
This is high art.
17:21 Your honor,
Alright Eddie, meat on the table, time to go to every McDonalds in the US and Canada
I am SO excited to see what you two have in store for next year, I would gladly see these two videos back to back in a theater as a feature film 😊
If I had a nickel for every time Eddy toured the country (and Canada) going to every single location of a novelty chain restaurant I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's still weird that it happened twice, right?
This whole time I thought it was Ted NiviSION (pronounced like Television)....
Yall should do all the mcmenamins restaurants and complete the passport but that is 65 location most in oregon and some In Washington
Eddie nobody asked for this
52:49 “You look lonely. I can fix that”
i just released its been a year or more since the Rain forest cafe video... man time flies...
me seeing the reason I became a UOAP 30:15
just thinking about those wonderful employees at north carolina’s margaritaville. it makes me so happy to be reminded that there are people like that out there who just do really nice things because they are just good people. @ those employees: I love you lowkey
You are doing the lords work.
Can you do bubba gump shrimp next year?
I'm just saying I've only been on Margaritavilles when on a cruise and there are definitely domestic cruises
The mad lad did it again!!!!!
you really love losing your mind, huh?
I’m going to wait for the ultimate challenge where he visits all the cheesecake factories
Fire
Ted has struck again
the guy dancing on the bridge in miami is there most days i see him on the way home from work it's the best
The Cat in the Hat ride at Islands of Adventure is amazing. I got on it every time I’m there.  Also, can’t wait for you and Ted’s next trip of visiting every Hard Rock Cafe in 2024.
Every cheesecake factory next
Eddy becomes a Michael Mann written character on the beach scene, just looking out at the water. Loved it.
I’m watching this video in the chair from his sponsor segment rn
LETS GO ITS TIME
I think they should do Chuck E Cheese next year
Eddy was really pulling off that hat though
So his tummy hurting immediately does that mean rainforest cafe is the better restaurant? You guys need to keep these trips rolling
HARD ROCK CAFE NEXT ???
Back to the MOA you go mustache man
I suggest you do a video eating at every Casa Bonita in the US, there's only one (its in Colorado), so that's easy. Plus you get really good sopapillas. Unfortunately, as the ownership has changed you don't get to experience the absolute abominations their non-sopapilla dishes are, however, the absolute fever dream that the restaurant is more than makes up for it.       (Plus watching non-Coloradans experience Casa Bonita for the first time and discover it is in fact a real place is immensely funny to me)
I just rewatched your guys' RFC videos the other day so this is a treat! Hopefully you aren't emotionally drained this trip
Just came here to say the pin points look like Samus  That is all
Drew is just a 13 year old 29 year old. And I love him.
EDDIE NOOOOOOOOO!!!! *Goes to watch video*
only a few minutes in but if Eddie doesn’t do the “give me one margarita imma open my legs” song and dance I’m unfollowing
One day we’re going to find Eddy dead at the entrance of an Islands
Happy you got to go to the first Margaritaville before it’s underwater
Hey broski, I think if you have similar thumbnails then people might confuse this with your rainforest Cafe video, so it might not get as much traction. Damn good video as always tho
57:17 The Planet Hollywood in the background feels very ominous
I just realised Ted and Eddy's ship name would be Teddy- its been over ten years since I've shipped irl people but dANG that's a good ship name. SoMEONE MAKE CHARACTERS CALLED TED N EDDY SO I CAN SHIP THEM 🔪
Hard rock casino when?
I will pay for toe pics. Just give me the opportunity and I’ll gladly give you money. Pleeeeeeeeease
I feel like I've learned something. Didn't need it, but I got it.
should have been me
Truly an amazing feat
I can’t believe there are now two videos on this platform featuring a man having a crisis of faith over a chain restaurant.
Eddie…Eddie…
Next should be every hard rock cafe
You could have done most of this on the train if you didn’t want to drive.
yeah that cat in the hat ride is horrifying lmao
Hard Rock Cafe?
52:50 You look lonely, I can fix that
Hey Eddy, will you be making an Only Fans where we can see your feet unpixelated? I would pay.
These two videos show how it’s not just the destination but also the mental breakdowns, friends, and strangely beautiful American attractions we meet along the way that can change us forever
Eddy. Why?
That was impressive now do all mc Donald's.
So bubba gump shrimp next year?
Eddy please..your family misses you
This is great to see as someone who works at Pier Park in PCB. Glad you enjoyed it ❤
Now do every Chili's.
Eddy I can't afford to do this dumb ass shit and I'm not going to watch the Paul Brothers for my dopamine, go do a dumb road trip and tell me about it, it makes us both feel better
I’ve seen way better pal
So you're doing all of the Planet Hollywoods and Hard Rock Cafe's next am i right????
Put the sponsorship while he was in the one state that they're excluded from using. Classy.
Jimmy Buffet and Margaritavile have been a long withstanding cultural thing in my family. This video weirdly enough brought back a lot of those childhood memories spent in those restaurants. In the same way the Rainforest Cafe did. You guys are awesome! I hope for your sanity you don't do another one of these.
Those safari fries don't seem so bad now
I audibly squealed seeing this post. Thank u for ur service eddy 🫡💕
Your girlfriend is hot
You didn't go to the Margaritaville in Shreveport Louisiana 😔
Eddy had a major glow up between road trips btw. Like man looks so damn good rn!
Now do McDonald’s
At this rate his skeleton is going to be fossilized before he even dies
I can’t wait for next year when you visit every McDonald’s in the USA
Can’t wait for the world tour of all the hard rock cafes 😂
This is it!! The content we desire
are you ok like mentally
The casual dead raccoon on the side of the road as part of the montage...
"Liking Buffet isn't some weird cult thing, its what can fix me." This quote just got to me XD thanks Eddy https://youtu.be/Bsb9T1g5nlE?t=1621
Eddy is braver than our troops for putting up with those tummy aches
As a former Arizona native, the noise I made when I saw the billboard for “The Thing” show up in this video… Genuinely one of the dumbest roadside attractions ever made 😭
I just can’t believe the one time I don’t go to destiny in New York your there
Can’t wait to see next year’s Planet Hollywood tour
Eddy was so cool in this video 😎
well now i need to see this every year
pls for the love of god go to dollywood
Eddie, you have seen things, done things, that no other mortal has. You are truly worthy of the title of Knee God
Probably shoulve waited a bit longer, since the boston location isnt open yet
Ted did 9/11
AND HE'S EDDY BUR-BACK Y'ALL
Since last year, this is definitely my new favourite kind of youtube format😂
Please end this series with a trilogy and do every Hard Rock Café 🙏🏾 Edit: Next year, of course
LOL at Atlanta traffic!!!!!
My parents once went to the Pigeon Forge Margaritaville while we were vacationing in that area. I wasn't allowed to go, nor did I want to, but perhaps that decision was a hasty one. Jimmy Buffet called me, and I did not answer...
Nobody tell this guy about Hard Rock Cafe
Going to that singular rainforest cafe at the end of the journey made me so happy, the adventures have come full circle
Thank you for your service Ted
Now that you've paid 2 giant corporations money who have overpriced restaurants, you gotta do a third and go for Hard Rock Cafe lol
self reflection comes on the toilet often.
Maybe I'm dumb, but the vivaldi music juxtaposed with the subject matter has me dying! LOL!!!
Ted is the kinda guy who would thrive in a zombie apocalypse
Cant wait to see them visit every hard rock cafe
Awesome journey, now do it again for every “Hard Rock Cafe” in America and Canada. The trifecta of cafes will be complete.
I wanted to get your new shirt but you don't do 3XL 😔
The margaritaville arcade is exactly how I imagined the lotus casino, from percy jackson, to look as a child
okay, now eat at every single Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
McDonald's next?
Why not rent... not a truck? 😂
TWICE?!
felt like eddy and ted were about to recreate the lighthouse, 10 out of 10
Next year is bubba Gump shrimp co.
I grew up around Biloxi, thank you Eddy for confirming that the Margaritaville arcade was, in fact, not a fever dream
Buccees slander should not be tolerated
Eddy you forgot to mention when you were in Syracuse that the Margaritaville hasn't paid rent to the mall in the past 3 years and have been sued twice for $1B lol
I felt sick to my stomach just seeing the same menu all those times lol
No way was your rainforest cafe video a year ago. That’s insane.
The only thing that could’ve made it better is if you would’ve shown us more of your knees
You have reached a new level of YouTube royalty
bih-luh-ksee
We are not worthy !!!
Can't wait till y'all got to every Ripley's! Believe it or Not!
My man talking about how busy Bucces is but hasn't seen 4-6 drum corps swamp onein the middle of a summer night at 10p.m.  after a show
I grew up in a town right next to Destin so I’m glad y’all enjoyed the views
If you do this again. Do hard rock cafe?
i can't wait to see eddy lose his mind traveling across the continent hitting up another restaurant chain a third time next summer
EDDIE WHY LMAOOOOOOOO
eddy burback, can you please stop doing this to yourself
HE DID IT AGAIN!!!!
Do chuck-e-cheese next
I’ve been waiting for this my whole life…. Or atleast since rainforest cafe….
Please tell me this road trip thing is going to be an annual thing lol
Cheesecake Factory next?
Now do every red robin
Y’all gotta finish the trilogy and go to every Bubba Gump’s Shrimp
11:58 THIS IS FUCKING TRUE IDK WHY BUT ITS TRUE
I wish I could make a living going around the country and eating at shitty restaurants...
In one year’s time… “I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country”
I watched the Rainforest Cafe video not even a month ago for the first time. I couldn't dream of this ever happening, but I'm glad it did.
Wait this is a real place??? I thought it was just something from Dream Daddy this entire time 💀💀
isn't there just 1 in Canada?
What a fantastic video I really hope you do visit Dollywood at some point!
Mans just casually living my dreams.  Gets to live my as well as every 60 year old parrothead's dreams
I mean you do vacation all the time, you make videos for a living
Oh no he did it again
Next eat at every TGI Fridays!
whats happening next year? every Bubba Gump?
Hooters next!
Now they need to finish out the trilogy by visiting every Buc-ee's
in times of stress just thibk wwjbd?
Looking forward to next year’s challenge
HE WAS IN DESTIN ARE YOU KIDDING ME
im from florida and this state is hell and theres too much rain
Next one hard rock
OMG MY FRESHMAN HISTORY TEACHER USED TO PLAY FOR HIM . He has his own band now. Jimmy and the beach bum band.
Do Mcdonalds next
Not again eddy
So uh when you gonna show Forrest and Bubba some respect with all the Bubba Gump locations? 😂
i love pier park!!! panama city beach is so beautiful
i have heard the word margarita so many times in the past hour that it doesnt even register as a word anymore
you didn’t go to the Jacksonville location
What’s the move for next year? Bubba gump?
Here I thought "Oh that's brilliant, they also stopped at every Margarittaville while doing the Rainforest Cafe Trip." No, these absolute psycho's did ANOTHER ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TRIP AROUND THE COUNTRY....Do it again.
help you missed the Jacksonville Beach one
Please do the unholy trifecta and go to every Hard Rock 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Day 19 had me crying lmao. Love the way you stage dramatic moments.
"You saw my toes for free and you owe me money!"  Dammit, you got me good with this one.
I bet eddy cant eat at every mcdonalds in the country lol
I'm so glad we got a follow up to the rainforest cafe!
Follow Up Video: The Margaritaville Cruise
We have this on the TV instead of my phone, said to my partner "Eddy deserve the big screen, ba-by" 😂
I like how Margaritaville is from this super famous celebrity, and around the entire country, and yet I’ve never heard of it. Gawd I love being oblivious to pop culture
Eddy not showing feet convinces me we're getting a feet onlyfans soon 🎉
Eddy you shouldn't do this. Get help
This is my appetizer for Barbenheimer.
I couldn't imagine doing this. Oh wait, I don't want to do this lol
Eddy is pushing the limits of scientific exploration once again 😮
The way Eddy pronounces Biloxi brings me very much pain.
EDDY (with love) WHY???
final time? bubba gumps is waiting for you eddy
I enjoyed this one so much. the first one started it all and this one carried the vibes.
Giant waste of money :)
NOT AGAIN EDDY NO
Hey, that's "Save the margaritas guy" from Jurassic World
Really hope you do bubba gump shrimp next. You'll get to see mall of america for a 3rd time!!
So next year you’re going to every Hard Rock Cafe, right? I mean come on, it’s only 35 locations in the US and Canada. Rookie numbers if you ask me.
oh no not again
Next year: medieval times
Babe! Wake up! Eddy went on another chain restaurant tour!
Eddy missed the opportunity to try out every single coke flavor in the world of coke factory in Atlanta 😭😭
Not sure if its just not a corporate location but there is a margaritaville in lake of the ozarks Missouri.
What restaurant is next?
They of course spotted a Florida man dancing 😂
Sorry Eddie, but you didn't go to the Margritaville in Jurassic World from the movie Jurassic World, please try again
You missed the one in Missouri, you have to start over.
I can't wait for eddy and ted to go to every chili's in the country next summer
These things are Masterpieces
McDonald’s should be next
HardRockCafeHardRockCafeHardRockCafe
This is me commenting before I watch this video…. I absolutely love Margaritaville and will 100% unsubscribe if something bad is said😂
0:12 WTF IS THIIIIIS  JIMMY BUFFET IS TEARING A RIFT IN OUR REALITY TO BECKON DEMONS INTO OUR WORLD
No joke, I had no idea Margharitaville was an actual thing.   I'm going to the Boston branch day 1 when it opens.
I had a horrid experience at city walk margarita ville in California. The food was wrong, overpriced, took an hour, just horrible
I’m sorry you got a tummy ache, Eddy :(
Thank you for doing this to yourself for us. I don't know what I gained or learned from watching, all I know is that it's five o'clock somewhere.
hate to say it but you missed one - St Thomas, US territory
Dang, I was waiting for you to go to the one in Sandusky, but I guess that one was created before Jimmy Buffet and isn't related to him. Guess I'll have to go to the one in Cleveland if I want to go to a real one.
…sat next to u guys in syracuse and didn’t want to interrupt u guys but my friends made fun of me
Like someone else said, a hard rock follow up to make a trilogy would be perfect 😂 medeival times would be funmy but its not the same vibes as the others
The one in Pensacola Beach just recently rebranded to a non Margaritaville resort. Beautiful beach, shame you missed it.
15:30 idk why but it reminds me of the lotus hotel in percy jackson
Eddie's mustache is back with a new vid! What a day!
You gotta try this one place next it's pretty neat and the food is "rockin" one might say. It's called Hard Rock Cafe idk if you've ever heard of it, it's a pretty underground place.
Thrilled you did this restaurant tour again so we could live and suffer vicariously through you.
Eddie Burback is doing the Lords work thank you brother
Soooooo... now Eddy and Ted have to do every Bubba Gumps in the country, right? 👀
Hard Rock Cafe next year?!?
This made my year
eddy, you coulda gotten a beer at one of these man
You didn’t go to Shreveport/Bossier City LA margaritaville 😢😢😢
I literally watched the rainforest cafe video last night wtf
As a jew I am ashamed that I haven't noticed Danny's Chicago jew phenotypes until now.
There are 34 Hard Rock Cafe locations in the US. Make it a trilogy, you coward!
So that's where you've been.
America can't do fish & chips.
i tune into your videos like my grandparents tuned into walter cronkite
when food (like your Jimmy's Jammin' Jambalaya) doesn't look hot, but then scalds your mouth when you try to eat it, that means it was 100% without a doubt microwaved
Next should be every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
Where should they go next year?
20 usd for THAT (the fish and chips)? That fish was not freshly caught. Where the fuck do they get off selling frozen fish for that much with some chips? As an Aussie, thats fucking insane to me. That's 30 aud by the way.
time to visit the atlanta margaritaville to thank them on your behalf
when you hit Cleveland and showed the Misny billboard I screamed -- thank you for representing lol
So, basically the mantra for this channel is: "First, I think of something that if I did it, it would make everyone say, _'Why did you do that?',_ and then, I do that thing."
12:45 Buc-ee's is king in Florida. All hail Buc-ee
44:00 you were in Syracuse 🥺?
No way he’s doing this shit again
I am not American and everything about this is so odd to me 😂
Can't wait for Ted's POV of this banger
I will say Ontario probably has a skunk issue
After seeing Eddy happy, I feel like it's Ted's turn to go insane.
dave n busters next
Is it gonna be Bubba Gumps or Hard Rock/Planet Hollywood next year...?
You’re forgetting the last of the trinity, bubba gump shrimp comp
You didnt go to the Jacksonville Beach Margaritaville! YOU'RE A LIAR!
My dad works at a Margaritaville Hotel and I feel like this video captured the essence of what it feels like to work there.
I live in AZ and have seen that sign “the thing” many times and always wondered what the thing actually was 😂 thank you for your service !
need me some friends that will travel the entire country with me to eat at every margaritaville together
10:24 I love that you don't stop to take a good picture of the people with you and just plop up the blurriest thing you can.
how was it still legal for you guys to drive after having alcohol in your blood 24/7
Why...
this was awesome I couldn't stop smiling loved the parallels to the original rainforest cafe video
So it planet hollywood next?
Can you please do this, but with Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next?
eddy youre insane how could you not do this for Hard Rock Cafe too?
Jimmy would have wanted you to get the jambalaya
Next trip should be to Dollywood
Jimmy buffet is not human but actually a robot making random quotes and random music
Ok cool now do all the Ripley's Believe It or Not museums
My favorite part was when Eddy beat that child in the arcade 😁😁😁
the one good thing mississippi offers is margaritaville in biloxi LOL I know, because i live right by it
Eddie, you are a damn legend. Kinda wanna pay to see your toes even tho I’m not into feet.
ted be driving after sucking down a lunch time margarita
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next year.
my main memory from my families universal trip was how AWFUL and TERRIFYING the cat in the hat ride was
why are you friends with jschlatt i liked the video up until he came out that's not cool unsubed
i know it's not the point but goddamn america looks so bleak
M O N O P O L Y R E D E M P T I O N 💸
BRAVO!
Every Bubba Gump location is next
I think itd be super funny if Ted made a video about this road trip with the same vibe Eddy had in his Rainforest Café vid
oh what?? Jarvis?
cheesecakw factory when
the blade runner reference was great
As someone who as a bit got top 0.005 listener of jimmy buffet i salute you
Thank you for your service 🫡
this had to be done
it was so cool to see you guys hit up the margaritaville at the island in pigeon forge! i too have a photo where the employees forced me to take one before riding the ferris wheel lol p.s. definitely hit up dollywood one day, one of the best theme parks in the country :)
Bro you infact were food poisoned by Chicago margarita ville
As a midwesterner, I believe you should go to all our Dave and Busters. There’s ten, and honestly you guys could have a nice Midwest adventure next year  Edit: I’m a fool, there’s way more than 10. There’s 152, but they should still do it 😂
Eddy, I need you to know that not only is this a restaurant and hotel chain, it’s also a 55+ housing community! There’s a couple in the south and my parents almost bought a house in one of the complexes 😂
Great video! You guys missed a location at Osage beach lake of the Ozarks.
47:52 I've never seen Danny in so much distress, what did Jimmy do to him?
i just finished watching and im crying this is so beautiful
8:30 …are you telling me that there is a museum that is dedicated to the Ninja Sex Party song “Dinosaur Laser Fight”?!?!??
Eddy in Margaritaville: A Crisis of Faith
cant wait for the hard rock cafe tour next year
You guys can now visit every bucees!
as someone who lives in Biloxi (said bih-luck-see btw not bill-awk-see) i can tell you that the resort is either full of alcoholic 50 year-olds or families with Too Many Kids - there is no in-between. glad you enjoyed it though <3
8:52 ken ham moment
Eddy nearly becoming a member of the Jimmy Buffett cult-sorry, religion, and reading from his book to Ted like it was scripture made me laugh so hard. I hope your sanity is doing ok Eddy
it feels so strange to know that i have eaten at two of these locations.
Did I just spend ONE HOUR watching some guy on a really fcking dumb road trip? Maybe
just learned that eddy burback was in my home town and i missed it. i am very upset.
Jimmy Buffet would’ve been proud. *I think…*
HES THE MAN WHO ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS NO ONE ASKS
Not being from the US I had no idea Margaritaville was an actual restaurant instead of just a place Jimmy made up for that one song.
hes done it again. that son of a bitch. im crying a little.
Wasn’t ready for a what if 9/11 was aliens bit. My day’s trajectory has changed
Love how Eddy and Ted switched mental states from the rainforest cafe one. The perfect sequel
You are very lucky Thing 1 and Thing 2 weren't moving on the Cat and the Hat ride. It's so much more terrifying when they do.
Cant wait for the hard rock cafe video
i went to the rainforest cafe because of your last video and got horrible food poisoning... maybe the tradition will continue and ill get food poisoning at margaritaville !
So you’re telling me that you were here-
You missed one in my hometown, but I don't blame you. It's a shithole, especially compared to all the huge cities you went to. 😭
i’m sorry but this should definitely be a series
My friend is determined to do this. NYCs and Atlantic Cities were my only visits lol
Fine alien butts and smooth elevators? What more can a girl ask for?
So nice to see Mississippi in a video and it not be for something negative. Love the Gulf Coast ❤
As a new jerseyan, i too need to take in all the essence whenever i can
I truly love how Eddy looks so deeply, violently unenthusiastic in almost every single thumbnail😂
I wish eddy was like Ted with rainforest cafe that would be the perfect revenge video
NO NO NO NOT AGAIN
Please do more of these, if this video could become a yearly treat I look forward too, I will be so happy
This mockumentary was amazing 😆
As a child born and raised in Arizona, I have always wanted to see the thing. I’m still going but this for sure did sell it
do u guys think they explored each others bodies
it is absolutely crazy just how high the quality is of the content you put out is. one of the most impressive YouTubers out there. just amazing stuff. god your girlfriend is hot
Wow, can’t wait to see what chain of restaurants they tackle next!
Eddy you missed one, margaritaville in the lake of the ozarks, (Osage beach) Missouri
I started watching this on my break at work but I realized it’s a big screen event so I’ve gotta wait till I’m off
you visited my city lol
how u not add the thing to ur new merch?
Imagine if next year they went to all of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co locations...
Thinking about how Eddy had to have been in my town at one point (there’s one 10 mins from my house)   Edit: they closed it right before his trip, it was closed on June 1st this year, not but a month and a half ago. Darn, well at least I’ve been to the Biloxi one (coolest arcade ever)
Now that is a Buffet Burn!! 😆
This means Dinosaur laser fight by nsp is historically accurate and a murder Ballad. No questions at this time
“Coolest motherfuckers on the entire planet” was the absolute highlight for me.
this is how i found out there’s a margaritavile 40 minutes from me
now do every mcdonald’s coward
Next year every Dave and busters. You won’t
no SC one?
52:26 the way he says "Ahhh yeah fuck that" is glorious
I just finished stage managing a musical a week ago where my favorite line we added was "John Doe just came back from margaritaville where he discovered that is was his own damn fault"  and i never thought id see the day where i see something like that happen, nor this soon
Nakey Jakey and Jarvis Johnson making guest appearances is my favorite thing. Love all you guys!  Edit: JSCHLATT!!!!!!!
You missed one bubba
Now I know why I like you, a fellow Chicago boy
The king has returned!
Why did you wait to get the Jambalaya in Minnesota??? THey don't know the meaning of seasonings there
as soon as i saw this i fr said "again eddy?"
Isn't jschlatt like racist
6:45  More like TOWkoma. Amirite?
The sequel!
Eddy please look back at this comment a year from now and remember that you don’t have to do this to yourself again
Hey Eddie, fun fact, I worked with one of the security guards at Mall of America and I guess at night mall security would run over rats behind Rain Forest Cafe on their segways. That's what I was told by an ex-security guard.
i’m can’t wait for teds pov of him suffering
Why tho?
I think this dude likes torturing himself
Hard Rock Cafe net year?  😳
until next year, when eddy eats at every hard rock cafe
4:08 Jarvis!!!!!!
That kid is gonna kick himself when he grows up and realizes he played a game of world-famous Stinky Feet with world-famous Eddy Burback.
You’re a legend Eddie 😂
YOU MISSED LAKE LANIER?
As a native Mississippian, hearing that pronunciation of Biloxi made me shudder a little.
And they would call him Hero
this rivals the Barbie Oppenheimer double feature
"I needed to treat this trip like I was Jimmy Buffet." Proceeds to sell his new margarita-themed merch...
Margaritaville at Universal Orlando is the only celeb restaurant that I thought "yeah I'd probably come back here. But I wouldn't go outta my way for it." Which is miles ahead of the others
Could you do “every subscribers house for dinner” road trip?
Did you know Jimmy Buffett killed a man in Tijuana when he was 17
alright guys, drop it in the replies of where you want Ted and Eddy to go next year! It has to be a weirdly niche restaurant that  is across the entire USA (and Canada). Would be lovely if they had some weird component like idk, thunderstorms every 20 minutes or like idk some crazy wacky giant blender for margaritas... but no places have those so.
Cant wait for "I ate at ever Hard Rock Cafe in the Country" :)
Can’t talk babe, Eddy went on another country spanning road-trip to visit every singe restaurant in a franchise.
I am not crazy! I know he swapped those margaritas. I knew it was in the Keys. One after Miami. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just – I just couldn’t prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the bungalow to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He’s done worse. That surfboard! Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He defecated through a sunroof! And I saved him! And I shouldn’t have. I took him into my own firm! What was I thinking? He’ll never change. He’ll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn’t keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn’t be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And HE gets to be a tropical singer/restaurant owner? What a sick joke! I should’ve stopped him when I had the chance! …And you, you have to stop him! You--
you guys missed the gatlinburg margaritaville
Heyy Eddy, you missed a Margaritaville in Lake Lanier (Georgia), well technically maybe not depending on what your classification is. The entire WATER PARK is a Margaritaville and the restaurant is called Landshark: A jimmy buffett Margaritaville restaurant. Landshark is jimmy buffett local beer, and is so good. Just wish you stopped by because it is only a hour outside of atlanta
did you guys skip the Margaritaville in Sandusky OH near Cedar Point
And I've watched an hour of my life looking at someone doing something pointless, how pointless is that?
Dude I saw you at the pigeon forge one on a date with my girlfriend but I didn’t want to say anything cuz I didn’t think it was you 😭
What's in Spencer's???
I love how in the last one Ted was chipper and Eddy was in hell, but the roles have reversed this time around. EDIT: Spoke way too soon lmao
imagine if Jimmy Buffet got in a controversy and put up a notes app apology on his instagram and it started showing up in those slide shows in every Margaritaville in North America
Next roadtrip idea: Eating at every Bubba Gump Shrimp locations in the united states
How he says Biloxi is stressing me out 😂   Baby it's:  Bull - uhx - e   But also if that's the joke bc you had to be in Mississippi I understand 🤣
I’m cleaning my house while watching this… Any inspired me so much I had a margarita. For Jimmy! 🥂
Today I learned that the Niagara falls are just in the middle of a city. Feels like finding out that the pyramids are just across the road from a fast food joint.
Hmmm, I starting to suspect Ted was responsible for a tragedy ☠️☠️☠️
every mcdonald’s in the usa next
yall missed the lake of the ozarks margaritaville
😂 Absolutely love these videos! Please make more!!
Can’t wait to see in a year   Visiting every Chuck E. Cheese in the country
There's a party at the end of the world.
I once got a lil poop on the floor in the Syracuse Margaritaville so I feel very bonded to you
I think next year you and Ted should do this again but every Hard Rock Cafe in America
I honestly really appreciate the explanations of things that are probably pretty obvious to Americans, like Key West. I've gotten so used to just glossing over some specific American culture things in videos that I have no clue about, this was a nice change :)
Rumor had it Jimmy Buffett is a total asshole. When i worked as event staff at one of his shows, he was a dick to our staff.
I will never forget also being lured into seeing “The Thing” and then the disappointment afterwards 😂
4:15  What menu?  On that note, can you please visit every Hooters?  I'll wait.
ok fine i'll subscribe
Same intro as last time. Respect.
You’re insane
This is truly one of the great ur-texts to understand American culture and the nature of faith
Im gonna need for a Thrillville 3 game to exist so that they can make one of the park themes a Margaritaville. Imagine you can build Jimmy Buffet themed roller coasters for no reason
As a Canadian, I'm honored that both our Rainforest Cafe and Margaritaville had your favorite meals of each trip. This time especially since you ordered poutine, our finest delicacy.  🇨🇦
Suddenly Chrissy's song makes a lot more sense
I was 48 minutes in when I had the realization that maybe mixing Margaritas and Roadtripping is not the best idea
Bruh you put a SoFi ad where FL residents aren’t eligible for the deal in the middle of the FL restaurant review! I feel slighted! Ahahah jkjk 😂
I basically grew up at his little sister's restaurant Lulu's. I have never stepped foot in a Margaritaville. Thank you Eddy, for going where I dare not to wander.
The fact you guys just got a younger tacoma instead of gas efficient car makes me weep and laugh
Wait...Shitty Wok actually exists? Here I was thinking it was just a hypothetical South Park restaurant name
CHILLS, I HAVE CHILLS. I'm so excited for this.
Thumbnail did the mustache SO GOOD ✨
I’d say do T-Rex but I genuinely think there’s only like 5 left lol
No way…. I just watched the rainforest cafe for the 14th time just yesterday 😂😂😂
I told my mom about how you woke up with a stomach ache after the first day (she’s a huge jimmy buffet fan) and all she said was “heh, rookie”
now do mcdonalds
i literally cherish these videos so much i don’t expect u to do them cause i can’t imagine how tolling it is but goddamn is it funny and entertaining 😭😭😭
"Oh shit, coolest motha fuckas on the planet" Lmao that dude was great!
I was at Vegas two days ago and ate at the Rainforest Cafe after seeing your video on it and as I was walking down the strip, I saw that there was a Margaritaville there too. Being a SoCal person, I had only ever seen another one in Universal City so I wondered just how many of them there were. Glad to see you quickly answered my question
Next up: every Hard Rock Cafe in the world?
Can’t wait to watch you hit every Hard Rock Cafe in America next year!
I love how Eddy gets ptsd from seeing Rainforest Cafés
wow, you are golf 👍
I'm so glad you guys got to take time to appreciate Destin and PCB. I live around there and sometimes forget how gorgeous it is
I understand the fear of the San Antonio Rainforest Cafe... We took a trip to San Antonio in Feb 2021 during the only time San Antonio ever got snow, and Rainforest Cafe was the only place open where we could eat for the week we were stuck there, before we could finally find a flight to get out lol
i live in east Tennessee 😈😈😈
You should eat at every Mr. Beat Burger next
My sister and I have bonded a lot over these food road trip videos. We’re definitely going to the Cleveland location asap lmao
Everyone knows he has to go to every Bubba Gumps next year, including Beijing, Cancun, Edmonton, Doha, Hong Kong, Bali, Osaka, Puerto Vallarta, Tokyo, and Toyosu. Eddy, it is only fair.
For years now, that Cat in the Hat ride at Universal has haunted me and my friends. Upon exiting, one of them stated "There is no heaven. There is no hell. There is only the Cat in the Hat." Thank you, Eddy, for validating my trauma and sharing in it.
Now do every mcdonalds in the world.
This was an amazing video. I liked this one more than the Rainforest Cafe one because I’ve actually been to three of these and the restaurants are a bit nostalgic for me. They remind me of being a kid again and going to Myrtle Beach. I hope you got to see the hurricane show at Myrtle and the Tequila show at Pigeon Forge!
Eddie go to every burger king in brazil next!
47:02 As someone who's commuted on the Metra for classes over the past 5-6 years, seeing the Chicago skyline in that green-tinged window still makes me feel a type of way.
city walk city wok sity wok
I butt clicked this, and I'm not upset.
should've dosed the  big margarita so the whole Ville could meet jimmy
the way you pronounce biloxi inflicts me physical anguish
No masks? We are still in the middle of a pandemic. People are still dying daily and if people did the simple act of wearing masks when they go out it would make it so much better.
14:05 I didn't record a lot because we got absolutely Mcwasted on Bourbon st, don't even try that with me Eddy.  "Wanted to relax" PFFFT
didnt drink a single landshark, sadness
I really can't wait for next year's trip visiting every Bubba Gump's in the country
hey eddy. Hard Rock International has venues in 74 countries, including 172 bar or cafe-restaurants, 37 hotels, and 4 casinos.
Be the change you want to see in the world, Eddy ♥️
Now go to every Hard Rock Cafe in the world
Finally, another one so I can take a break from watching the Rainforest cafe video on loop
You missed the Margaritaville at Lake lanier in Georgia!!!
I love these odyssey videos. Thank you for suffering for our entertainment!
I'm watching this while eating lunch and I also have a tummy ache, needless to say it was kind of a tough watch because of it 🤢🤣.
I confused this thumbnail for the rainforest cafe one because I was in absolute denial that you would ever do this to yourself again
Classic
Teehee
Is the cleveland margaritaville not even on the lake??
I can't wait to watch the 10 hour long "I ate at every McDonald's in the country"
Holy shit this video is an hour?! I haven’t moved in an hour?!
NO WAY
I haven’t even started the video but I am so ready!!
HARK AND PRAY TELL! EDDY HATH ARISEN!!!!
Did you skip the one in Palm Springs? LOL
this is the greatest gift i could possibly ever ask for
more please! This is the second time i watched a video this long while being entertained the entire time! ( cant forget about the rainforest <333)
Can’t wait for you to lose your mind over Forrest when you visit every Bubba Gump next summer!
I had two instances of running into people I knew randomly in Louisiana.  I think it's a Louisiana thing.  Also  if you ever go back to San Antonio River walk go have a drink at Durty Nelly's it's the best bar.
oh eddy…sweetie… you gotta learn to be kind to yourself
After going on my first long solo Roadtrip a month ago this shakes me to my core.
As a Texan- bucee is SCARY especially when they have the mascot out greeting people
It is really funny to me as a Syracuse local that I didn't even know that the Margaritaville was still open lol. I go to destiny with my friends a fair bit and I still thought it was closed.
You missed one in the lake of the ozarks in Missouri.
make this a yearly thing. i know it’s hurting you but it’s beautiful to watch
I’m so high rn and ALIEN DINO MUSEUM??? HELP
i love that all of my favorite youtubers are utterly insane
I have been joking for months that my SO and i should go into magaritaville so we could have a eddy moment and I SHOULD HAVE WENT
bro give ur self a break
Next Year: Goes to every single McDonalds in America  Never seen again.
What's next? Rax? Shakey's Pizza? Ponderosa Steakhouse? Well done Eddy.
looking forward to the Medieval Times roadtrip
I feel I can relate, this year I’ve been traveling as much as I can,   And I don’t regret making these decisions
when you spotted that wacky guy in miami, all i could was just “yeah, seems about right, that’s home to me.”
They just built a margaritaville fucking community in Daytona Beach. It’s a whole fucking neighborhood (think the villages in central Florida) and all the houses are all themed. It was built a few years ago and the bidding on buying the houses was insane and the talk around town here. It’s so weird.
WASTING AWAY IN MAGARIYAVILLE !!!!!!
Ok so hear me out on this idea for your next tour across the US eating at every type of a Restaurant.  SUBWAY!!!  You will literally never have to come up with another video idea your entire life since this will take you over 20 years to make it to every single Subway.  Your welcome and good luck
Now you should do McDonald's
Lies, you skipped the one at the tip of Texas in South Padre…. However that arguably would have been the worst one
AHHHH ITS HAPPENING AGAIN
Didn't you do this already?
Do McDonalds next
I'm guessing the next restaurant is Dick's Last Resort.
They really classed up the thing exhibit since I went in 2015.
I went to the one Margaritaville in Orlando like, twice, so we're basically the same Eddy
What's the next one? Planet Hollywood? Hard Rock Cafe?
the definition of insanity. Rain Forest Cafe wasn't enough. Margaritaville had to be next. You sir... are a risk taker.
Haven't watched the video yet but I have to ask. Have you learned nothing?
this makes me wanna do a usa road trip
PLEASE go on the margarita-ville cruise
2:15 boredom
Please, you can't keep hurting yourself like this
Eddys bizarre margaritaville adventures
Today I learned the only Margaritaville I've ever been to (Santa Cruz) isn't one of Jimmy's
Margaritaville is a real place? Well, today I learned just that. I thought it was a joke place. We don't have it in Europe.
babe wake up new teddy road trip just dropped
I cant wait for Ted's version
I wonder what eddy and teds banks think when they have like 25 plus purchases from margritaville
Bubba Gump shirp next
The stinky footed child was god
Eddie releasing blockbuster length videos now merry Christmas everyone
Jimmy Buffet super sucks
hunny, grab the kids eddy posted
The running joke that Ted has more fun the more chaotic it gets is incredible
Margaritaville just opened a hotel in South Padre Island…I guess you need to go back! 😂
Clicked on this while simultaneously saying “nooooo whhyyyyyyy?”
Great effort but I regret to inform you that there is a margaritaville at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri
Oh so that's what The Thing is
Here we go again
Señor Frog's next?
i love these videos
now hear me out, what if you do it again next year with a different restaurant
Oh boy! Another installment of Ted and Ed Take on the Restaurants of America!
Again!?!?!?
what about the cruise tho
-opens youtube -sees a 1 hour Eddy video -THANK YOU EDDY BEST DAY EVER!
I was hoping for Bubba Gump. My wife and I have been to two so far. We'll probably hit up the Vegas on when we're there next. For a chain restaurant it's pretty good with a diverse menu.
The fact I’ve never heard of Jimmy buffet yet he has such a large fanbase and hold the United States of America, scares me
But why….?😂😂😂
I cant wait for Ted's video where hes miserable and hate his life
I work at the one in Hollywood California, mad as hell I missed you
Shirt purchased. Couldn’t be more stoked. Or hungry.
You are a legend. These road trips are amazing. Sending luv from New Orleans!
Obviously every Hard Rock Cafe is next, right? And then maybe all the Chuck E Cheeses?
N O W  G O  T O  E V E R Y  M C D O N A L D S  I N  T H E  W O R L D
next year try every Hard Rock Cafe
35:25 100% there was spit and god only knows what else in those Ribs and Fries.... hacky
God my depression and ptsd are really bad when I just wake up, and I just woke up, but already this fills the morning with joy! (Well, afternoon lol)
Aye Key West this is my hometown! I just came back from there! things have changed so much. Thanks for all your content Eddy!
“I jimmied a little too close to the sun” 😂
hardrock cafe???
Planet Hollywood when?
going to margaritaville was one the most magical experiences for me as a parrot head
Wait isn’t there one in Shreveport Louisiana?
I live near pigeon forge and the margaritaville restaurant and resort. It is old peoples paradise.
Seems the Canadian restaurants always test better
this video and the rainforest cafe video give me a very distorted idea of what the United States looks like
Thank you Deep Eddy for another banger of a video
the hurricane at the Myrtle Beach margaritaville gave me childhood trauma
I never thought hearing a grown ass man say "my tummy hurts" multiple times would be so adorable af
dang Jimmy is from right around Biloxi, MS (Pascagoula). Would have been a fun stop bc and I cannot emphasize this enough, they have a bridge named after him and it crosses ~a drainage ditch~ or at least that was the case a couple of years ago.
BURBACK IS BACK BABY!
I don’t know how Ted was able to do this without any safari fries.
have i ever heard of this establishment? no. will i watch an hour long video about it? absolutely!
One must assume Eddy to be happy
The sequel we didn't expect, but are eternally grateful for!
I live 10 minutes from that buc-ee's and if I'd known Eddy and Ted were gonna be there...I never would have found them in that place anyway so it doesn't matter. Thanks for nothing everyone
hard rock cafe next?
Now you have to go to every T-Rex Cafe in America :)
Do McDonald’s next
Now go on the margritaville cruise
i wonder what next years cross country restaurant chain visit will be
hard rock cafe next :)
So is Fuddruckers happening next?
You know, there’s only 34 hard rock cafes in the United States
I can’t believe the rainforest video was a year ago it only feels like last month
At this point I am both impressed and concerned about your wellbeing.
We got married during the pandemic and live in Orlando so we honeymooned in the cottages at Margaritaville and hing out at Universal and Discovery Cove and honestly... fucking amazing staycation.
I can't believe that I actually watched the whole one hour thing. And enjoyed it.
Next imma need a "We went to every subway in America"
Do Waltmart next
Having friends must be cool
You did this Eddy. Now this is the niche that you carved for yourself. I expect more roadtrip chain restaurant videos at least 3 times a year
the fact that they've survived two of these road trips and eddy only contemplated killing ted once is honestly a testament to their friendship
ted sitting in the chair at 12:04 was amazing. also, i love buddy
Alternate title: Ted gets spiritually summoned back to Buc-ee’s and they take the scenic route back
I remember going to the Chicago margaritaville on the pier ten years ago and it was a very cold and rainy day, but the power of Jimmy persevered!
Hard Rock Cafe gotta be next
eddy made a joke about tinnitus early in the video and then played a ringing noise later in the video that almost blew my brain up so i think eddy hates ppl with tinnitus 🙄 #tinnituserscanceleddy
Just wait until he does eating at every Hard Rock Cafe across the US (+ Canada).
There really is a whole arc with character development and everything here. Whoever wrote these characters did a really good job.
Great vid man! As a guy that helped construct the landscaping for Margaritaville Gatlinburg, while unique stands out big time in the middle of a forest instead of where it belongs...a BEACH perhaps? 3 months listening to Jimmy Buffetts 5 greatest hits blaring in my ears through the entire complex for 14-16 hours straight 6 days a week certainly drove me crazy. Food extra overpriced, $17 for a burger pre 2020, damn! Anyways, for what it's worth very detailed and beautiful. I give Ole Jimmy kudos for the idea and hella profiting off his legacy. It's like Dollywood, you gotta try it at least once. But then run, far far away.
Good job! Next time what about McDonalds? 😂😂
New comfort video: unlocked
You are the most ambitious man on YouTube. In at 178k views before 17m lol
I am once again saying that in a year or two this is what I WILL be doing in my Astro Van on Route 66.
NOT AGAINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
I really wanna know how much all this cost. My dad loves margaritaville and wants to do this exact trip.
Do bubba gump shrimp next!
I was literally at a Margaritaville LAST NIGHT talking about your Rainforest Cafe video! I’ve never suspected that we live in a simulation before, but now…
Now do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, Senor Frogs, Joe's Crab Shack, visit all 4 Planet Hollywood locations (including Malta and Qatar),  and every Medieval times location
The long awaited and unexpected sequel
You have filled yourself with edible sadness on depressing road trips twice now. That's on you.
I live in Miami & park in a Margaritaville parking garage when I go to the beach, that's about as close as I get to the interior of one. This is all news to me.
Kino
Eddy, you gotta stop doing this to yourself! D:
that family joke near the end was a banger bahahhaha
Oh shit, here we go again
The sequel I didn’t know I needed.
But why though? Note, I didn't watch the video and even if I did I refuse to retain any information. Why did you do this Eddy?
Do McDonald's next
$11.75 cocktail served in a plastic cup, i don't wanna be around anymore
I can't fucking believe you did it again.
You should actually stop at the Island in Piegon Forge TN as someone who has went there it is pretty good.
Ah yes my favorite Jimmy Buffet song “Pour me something tall and strong…..doors must be unlocked at all times during business hours” 😂😂😂
Weirdest question, but I can only imagine Eddy's bathroom stops after these. I mean like my dude, is your tummy ok?
Can't wait for next year to see eddy go to every Dollywood
that "THE BEAN!!!!" moment at 48:03 was very "ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCCINOS" 👏
This man is a legend
Shoutout to Eddy for having the common sense to not broadcast the face of a random 4 year old child to his YouTube channel
LIVIN ON SPONGE CAKE
Now do every Subway
I went to key west once after being taken by family who lived in Florida and yeah holy shit. When Eddy said "I'm so glad this is sponsored because I would not be paying for this myself", he is not joking. A simple, cheap pay per hour parking lot from the one time I visited cost $30 per hour. Nothing fancy, just a concrete pad with paint lines and yet $30 per hour. If it costs that much just to park, I cannot imagine the cost of a hotel room.
why eddy would you do this willingly to yourself again, you must like traveling or like obscure restaurants
waiting for the next one of this series :) hopefully eddy doesnt die from stomach issues next time :3
cute & sweet
hard rock cafe next?
Final time?! Nah see y’all next year when you go to every Bubba Gump’s Shrimp.
I can't believe you went on this trip and sis not stop at the florabama. P much where jimmy started it all. Also, those margaritaville cult members you're talking about call themselves "parrot heads"
Hell yeah the sequel dropped.
Now do every Chuck E. Cheese
52:53 "you look lonely"
I’m like 7 minutes in and I’m realizing this trip would be impossible without Ted
eddy burback character development was major in this one I must say
why
I wish I knew when you were here in Destin 🥲
2:15 shots fired at Gears and Gasoline
I had a bloody nose outside the Orlando city walk location 8/10 visit the music added to my experience
Out of all the things in this video, I am glad you did New Mexico right!
My family used to go to Pigeon Forge all the time. It’s so fucking odd
Now do Bubba Gump's
Next year “I WENT TO EVERY HARDROCK CAFE IN AMERICA”
WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF A SECOND TIME
After another 2 month disappearance, drops a banger.
Eddy having deep Eddy for the first time was a sight to see
All the girls in this video are cute AF, what are these guys doing?
Anyone else feel like feet came up a bit too much in this video?? 😭😭
You didn’t come to the Medford, OR location:(
Hey Eddie you missed one in Lake of the Ozarks Missouri
BEST VIDEO YET
This is so funny
God, Myrtle Beach. Had haunted my whole gd life  Edit: also not shocked a chain place in MB would suck big time.
Another masterpiece in themed restaurant paradise
The hard rock cafes are getting ready as we speak
47:11 tell me you’re  in Chicago without telling me you’re in Chicago
isnt the dino alien museum just a more boring version of Dino Riders?
With this being an annual tradition: Man, going to every Hard Rock Cafe in the US next year is gonna kill'em...  Then, the final boss... That would have to be a year long endeavor...   The Cheesecake Factory
fun fact: the thing was originally implying that H*tler was an alien and it was first brought to the store in 1965
Whats next? Hard rock cafe?
He’s done it again. I’m so scared
35:06 that’s actually insanely nice of them
as a wisconsinite, we call pigeon forge the Wisconsin Dells of the smokies lmao
Hard Rock Cafe next please
Can't wait for you to visit every Hard Rock Cafe next summer
Very Sorry to tell you but you missed the one in the airport in Puerto Rico.  The title is a LIE
Having driven through Pigeon Forge several times now, my take is that it looks like a Soviet documentary on American decadence and corruption, with a big helping of racism on the side.  On the plus side, the last time I drove through the "American Civil War Theatre" appeared to have gone out of business. So that's good.
I think this entire trips is revenge for high energy Ted during the Rainforest Cafe trip lol.
I don't even care if you film a perfectly normal vacation trip next year with healthier food options, these are amazing videos. Don't overdue it and burn yourself out, though.
i would watch these themed chain restaurant road trip videos in theaters
Now eat at every Rainforest Cafe in the World
Next year: I ate at every mcdonalds in the country
I will pay good money to see you spend 6 weeks doing all 36 Hard Rock Cafes in the US and Canada
Someone needs to do this but for Waffle House, that would actually drive a man insane, and also take probably an entire year.
as Eddy contemplated killing Ted, and the way the video was being edited, i had a realization. Were these trips Ted's attempt to kill Eddy?
i think that eddy needs to make bumper stickers that say wwjd (what would jimmy do)
“Cool Eddie” gives off the same vibes as “dark Brandon”
If you do this again, which I hope you do, Hard Rock Cafe would be an excellent choice.  34 locations in the US.
you would not believe how much it pained me to learn the the margaritaville in capitola, california was unassociated with the jimmy buffet chain. i was so excited to see eddie eating at a restaurant i’ve made about 2 fond memories at, but now it may never happen
What about the Margaritaville in Jacksonville Beach? Did you just get tired of Florida?
YOU BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT TENNESSEE
Monopoly Redekption in the Background 14:53
Oh man... "BilAXI" 😭  I'm from the MS Gulf Coast and love your videos Eggy
Learning a lot about the US, everything truly is bigger, that gas station location was insane...
brothers, he did it again
omg we are so back
Now Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
Eddy, I'm concerned. I would say you're going to go insane, but I fear it's too late. 😢
Yes
Eddy baby. I love these videos you do. So sorry for your suffering but omg these are fantastic. I was just by the Niagra Falls Margaritaville and now I am bummed I missed out lol. Sowwy for tummy hurt!
2nd time in a row I've been in Niagara at the same time as Eddy and haven't seen him 💀
I fear that at the end of this trip, you will hate Jimmy Buffet. A month spent eating 22 times in a restaurant with his music blasting will probably make the whole thing feel tired at the end, and Jimmy Buffet will trigger a trauma response.
This is gonna be better than the rainforest cafe video....
10:23 jumpscare
This will eventually lead to Eddy’s magnum opus…eating at every Mcdongle in the whole world
Medieval Times next 😎
within the past two months i’ve heard about buc-ee’s so much that i’m surprised that i’ve never seen one in real life. they look incredibly insane.
it's kind of impressive
Hard Rock Cafe or Cheese Cake Cafe next? Man, restaurants in the USA are so weird. The theming is so much.
Seeing that the Rainforest Cafe video is one of my top 5 favourite Youtube videos of all time, it felt kinda special that this one came out on my birthday. It's almost like a lil' birthday gift too me :)
I used to work in Tulsa as an Uber Driver. I have been to the River Spirit Casino dozens of times but I had no idea they even had a Margaritaville, let alone that it was owned by Margaritaville.
Do McDonalds next
My mom worked as a server at the Key West Margaritaville back when i was a kid in the late 90s and Jimmy would absolutely just fly in on his tiny planes and perform with no heads up in the Keys, idk about any other location.  I have a pic of my mom in her work clothes with a tiny tie dye covered beach toddler (me) and a very sweaty Jimmy. All of us tan as hell. Weird childhood.
Nope. NOPE. You started me down a rabbit hole about The Thing, and I can't find a single source that explains what The Thing is being advertised as. Like, there are ideas about what it actually is (that are super dark and exploitative), but WHY IS ITY CALLED THE THING AND WHAT IS THE OVERALL CONTEXT IN THE MUSEUM?!?!?!?! I need to know, Eggy. The world deserves answers.
oh you just be doing shit fr
Y'all really got to do Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory next. 22 locations in the US plus a box of chocolates.
I like that they seemingly flipped views on this but also that Eddy is almost forced to be like Ted was last time
Hard Rock Cafe may be even more difficult
aww what a cute little skunk guy
Eddie have you learnt NOTHING NOTHING from the forest cafe video
you GOTTA do one for hard rock cafe
There is also a retirement village margaritaville
Eddy looses sanity for our entertainment. I respect that.
bro missed the best one in Conroe Texas.....
Needs to be at least a trilogy. Next year should be every Wahlburgers in the country.
You were at the casino right across the street from my apartments! I live on riverside in Tulsa! I'm glad the food there was good, and yes, the machines there are weird, there's even a dune one for some reason? Sad I didn't get to see you though!
This set up perfectly for your next summer trip: Medeival Times!
Omg i was eating at a margaritaville last month and made the joke that i was gonna parody your rain forest cafe vid and go to every margaritaville 😂
What the fuck I was literally rewatching the rainforest cafe video yesterday
Retirement Project: "I ate at every McDonalds in the World"
You see as a poor starving African I knew abotu the song... and when I learnt that Margaritaville was a resturant (5 seconds before i clicked on this video) I assumed the song refered to an exisitng chain resturant... like we made a song about McD's... I never imagined the commerical capitalist hell scape of a resturant built becuase of the song...
The perfect final video would be doing both margaritaville and rainforest cafe in the same trip
what do you mean you weren't sponsored by Margaritaville? our lord and saviour Jimmy graced you with his presence every day. that, my friend, is payment enough.
So is next year hard rock, its a Neverending hell, anyone else have any recommendations
I like the new couch and tapesty. I kind of despised the red/purple combo ngl
eddy's funniest jokes so often boil down to "i thought there was going to be more to that sentence". the hard cut after "you guys don't know how hard it is to be a youtuber," had me in tears
Next episode: I ate at every red lobster in the country
my favorite series on youtube
Buddy was the best part of this video!
This was an absolute masterpiece. I laughed and had sympathy tummy issues for you. Im so proud of you both. And I bought some merch.
Ahem, excuse me, but Binkley's real first name was T. So you're way outside the box. Credible source.
I can’t believe Eddy Burback went on that Ferris wheel I was scared of when I was eleven. Thanks Jimmy.
Requesting every Sloppy Joes and/or T-Rex Cafe next.
Next up: we visited every Starbucks in a suburban town (there’s at least 50)
This is quickly becoming my favorite series on Youtube. Thank you. Edit: I just finished it and idk why im crying, this was so beautiful..
37:26 No because that's EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
Today is my birthday and this is what I needed, Eddy.
do this again but with Mcdonalds in Cali
This is the content no one is asking for but I'm sure glad you're making it
why do you do this to yourself
The long awaited sequel
I hate to say this but you missed one in Capitola
23:23 was not expecting to find out there's on island with my name on it off the coast of florida today
the fact that in the mall of america ted one handed a burger  kinda freaks me out? ive never seen someone do that?
The cat and the hat ride finally getting the publicity it deserves 😤
Yessssssssssss, I needed this
Way to make my day, bruh. God bless you Mr. Buffett!
I won’t stand for the cat and the hat ride slander. That’s the best place to cool off in the park
Wish they flew to cancun and had the airport margaritaville
They should make a drink called the "burrr-back"
maybe the real margaritaville was the friends we made along the way
Do the bubba gump shrimp restaurants next
I can't believe you posted this on the same day I'M going to CityWalk!
This video got weirder and weirder until at the end Eddy got possessed by Jimmy Margarita and cheated on his girlfriend with a blond dude with a mustache
In theory this sounds cool. Making a video trying all the same restraunts around America. But Id get to like one and then have someone recommend this insane burger place that I would have to try, while in town and that would be down. The video would turn into the 24 best places to eat around America. :')
You missed one...Lake of the Ozarks
47:16 that was hellaa funnny
Went to my first Buc-ee's this year on a road trip to Disney. Absolutely bonkers place to be. You take 4 steps from your loved ones and suddenly you're lost and afraid in a vortex of beef jerky and roasted cashews
another certified food classic
Next video is every Hard Rock cafe
i love this shiiiii💚
Bro, you and Ted should do all the Hard Rock Cafes  across the world. Less driving, flights would be tax right offs for your work, plus you get to travel internationally.
why do you keep doing this to yourself
Not the Cheetah-rita
Please do Bubba gumps next year 🙏🏻
Driving over the sampit river smells horrible but pretty sunset
MAN THEY UPDATED THE FUCK OUT OF THE THING EXHIBIT SINCE I'D BEEN THERE
Eddie u should go to every single Hooters in the country 😏
I wonder how many Chuck E. Cheeses are in America? 🤔
You guys completely missed the one in Oregon!
the genuine concern i had for your wellbeing seeing you did this AGAIN...
loved the dramatic violin over the statue of liberty XD
I had no idea that Jimmy was into the gentrification of neighborhoods... one might say they got... Jimtrified? I'll see myself out.
Trilogy! Trilogy! Trilogy!
I love how the Canada locations are regularly above average
This is so wholesome and beautiful. Riped me right out of my depression. Thank you man
Biloxi = Bil-uh-xi Video was great!
You need a bottle of Jimmy Buffet-branded Tums after all that. Just like Banksy said, Its five o'clock somewhere
You guys should have rented an rv 😂
Bravo eddy
See yall next year when Eddy eats at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
Hard Rock Cafe when
Eddie are you kidding me
Seems to me that Margaritaville is all about consumerism and alcoholism.
It should have been called I went to every Jimmy Buffet Buffet
Omg I can’t wait to watch this on repeat with the rainforest cafe.
I’m from Tulsa and the Margaritaville here has a special place in my heart because I took my prom pictures there. It was raining outside and they had a bunch of plants we could stand front of lmao
THE THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ARIZONA
American food looks so horrible lol, everything be fried
Jet Lag season 8:
Can't wait for next year, where they go to every Hard Rock Cafe!
When I watched the rainforest cafe video I was waiting to get into universal studios Florida now I’m waiting for my appointment at the dentist
Why -_-;
can’t wait to see Ted’s video
Buddy was worth everything!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqMIzW5OU6w
If this is going to every x in the country is gonna become a yearly tradition, I am so down for it
TIL that Destiny USA has a Margaritaville. I have no idea where it would even be. I suspect that that segment was actually CGI.
I only know of Jimmy Buffet being parodied in South Park as a last minute change replacing Elton John at a benefit for Cartman who had contracted AIDS.
Thank you for stopping at the “The Thing” museum! Driven by it a few times and always wanted to know but never stopped. Now I don’t have to! 😂
can you guys do cracker barrel next please
You know, there aren't that many Bubba Gump Shrimp locations.....
But seriously...what's Ted's alibi for 9/11...?
You missed Jimmy Buffet's sisters restaurant LuLu's
12:08 The thud💀
Next trip, every Hard Rock Cafe!
Now go to every McDonald’s in the country
I saw the title and laughed so hard I got tears in my eyes. Eddy why on earth would you do this again??
47:12 is gold
what about cheeseburger in paradise HUH
Ya did it again 🎉😅 the clip of the kid running behind you at the beach is so good!
Every McDonald’s this next
28:10 I sat on that couch
Petition for them to go back and do a dollywood video
And so history repeats itself..
upon seeing this in my notifications first thing after waking up, i said out loud "eddy NO"
42:20
THE THING LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO!!! AZ ICONIC LOCATION!
Praying that Hard Rock is next
Wild
Eddie please I am starting to think you genuinely enjoy being like this.
I'd join a Margaritaville cult. I'd join a Margaritaville cult in a HEARTBEAT.
I really enjoy watching these starting with Ted’s perspective first as he went with this (last time) being very optimistic, then watching Eddy’s perspective being a complete 180 had me rolling.
Visiting every Margaritaville is like spending a weekend smoking too much weed with your dad. Visiting every Rainforest Café is more like an ayahuasca trip.
Eddy: I definitely totally took this road trip just for the margaritaville video.  Also Eddy: Takes 24 day road trip with his friends.
Next up, McDonald's!
I wish he would include a pre and post trip weigh in
Missed out on the Margaritaville cruise. I promise it's a 6/10 time and you need to go on it!
Hes gonna do bubba gumps next
as a texan i can fully agree buccee scares me. ( i still love it tho)
I think Ted was slowly getting Stolkholm Syndrome from Margaritaville.
Do Starbucks next
LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER ONE OF THESE
Now do it again next year with bubba gumps
Predicting a Bubba Gump road trip next year.
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I went, "Not again..."
I have a margaritaville blender cup because I won a Michael Jackson dance contest on a boat by doing the worm so poorly it made my knees bleed. I only won because I was probably 10 years old.
can’t wait for their next road trip where eddy inevitably murders ted!
Your pain is my pleasure. Here we go round 2 🎉
The worst part of all of this is I was in the Orlando area both Disney springs and universal on the nights eddy was in town on  those nights (I’m 95% positive)and could have been blessed with meeting some of my fav YouTubers and instead I must languish in my pain of missed opportunities
Dollywood truly is a gem. The rest of Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg is just Myrtle Beach in the mountains.
I live a ten minute walk from both Margaritaville and the Rainforest Cafe and work like 3 minutes from the Cafe I'm surprised I've never seen you
I need Ted to do a video of this trip where he’s miserable now(at least til toward the end). A nice little role reversal of last years trip
Nice try, Eddy Ninepins.
Next one, whatever chain he does, he’s gonna go worldwide
Someone’s should calculate what percentage of meals from this video and the rain forest cafe video eddy ordered that were fish 😂
Dicks next
I personally know 4 people (3 Security Guards and 1 Vendor) who worked Jimmy Buffet concerts, and every single one of them said he was the worst human being they ever had to deal with.  They told me horror stories about that guy.
The Drak Knight, The Godfather Part II, The Empire Stricks Back, this video
TIM MISNEY MAKING A CAMEO
Having lived in AZ my whole life The Thing rest stop is a staple of traveling through that area. Seen those billboards my entire life. I'm 30 now
I’m from Myrtle beach Sc and that sounds on par for a lot of the restaurants in that area
This video made me go to the gas station and get a lime-a-Rita. Also, it’s pronounced bi-lux-ie 😭 watching you go to PF almost made me feel homesick for my second home but also very disappointed /lhj you didn’t touch on the pop culture shop there because it’s awesome. Or the MV cafe though I have absolutely no idea why there’s a cafe for that and the prices were pretty high for basic coffee. Anyways, Hope you had a fun time overall though!!
Can't wait for every McDonald's
I hate to say this, but I regret to inform you that you missed a location in Shreveport, Louisiana. Considering how you were near your death throws in Las Vegas, I understand not going to North Louisiana to eat another Jammin' Jambalaya.
Waiting next year for Eddie to finish the trilogy- even if he doesn’t want to.
New mission:Every Cracker Barrell, youre never leave the road
You should eat at every McDonalds in America
When is the International Bubba Gump Shrimp challenge??
But you missed the one in Jurassic World!
next you should do every McDonald's
Ah shit here we go again
How about every McDonald's in world next? :)
9:36 Notice how Ted didn't deny it...
Yesssssss
you didnt download the live performance texture pack trust me they rockin tf out
There is also a Rainforest Cafe across from Niagara Falls ;)
i live in florida, and yes one of the locations is in my hometown, but it really is a cult. i cant escape jimmy, even the retirement communities have his stuff plastered everywhere
greatest series of all time. Señor Frogs next summer? Mexico and US?
How do these videos always end up with Eddy wanting to murder Ted....
Yes Eddie suffer for our entertainment suffffferrrrrrrrrr
Great work as always but you did miss one. There’s a Margaritaville in the Miami International Airport, bad news is it’s terrible, good luck!❤
Oh boy I am excited for this, holy shit
major spoiler alerts for The Thing smh
flashing back to getting to explore the San Antionio Riverwalk as an excited teenager from a tiny town and thinking it was the height of luxury and glamor because not only are they slightly more posh versions of the regular chain restaurants, they are chain restaurants almost no small town has lmao. It's such a shame Planet Hollywood shut down, I would have enjoyed a full video of you visiting those ; ;
It’s so weird seeing Eddy drive through Pigeon Forge and see all the land marks I’ve passed so many times lol
See ya next year for the Hard Rock Cafe video
Can’t wait for you to visit every McDonald’s in America
more life long bucket list vlogs please
JIMMY’D A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN 💀🌞😔☀️⛅️😭
is it bad my first thought was, I hope he has another breakdown? Thank you for suffering for our entertainment Eddy. :)
No one tell this man about Hard Rock Cafe’s.
Bro is going to go to medieval times or Joes Crab Shack next year
the way he pronounced Biloxi made me giggle
I feel so inspired. I shouldn't.
Bubba Gump next year then.
If you didn't go to the site of the planned Minnesota Margaritaville then this doesn't count. Jimmy told me.
you gotta go to all the hard rock cafes now
My god…he’s done it again…
again?
So next year yall are headed to all the Hard Rock cafes, right?
You're telling me this wont just be a uearly trip for you and ted?
alrighty, Eddie has officially gone insane or is a masochist.
Eddy! There's a Margaritaville in Capitola, CA but it's not Jimmy branded it's just an expensive seafood restaurant
Eddie I must say it’s an honor seeing you go to The Thing on i-10, my friends younger sister ended up shitting herself right where you stood at 9:08, God bless you Eddie Burback
Why does the Bean segment feel like an early 2000s music video?
52:52 "You look lonely, I can fix that..."
The most heartbreaking part of this video is finding out the Margaritaville in my childhood hometown closed down because I was so excited to see the chaos of  Eddy going to that crappy restaurant
Do hard rock next
Not to be that guy but it's "bi- LUCK-si" not "bi-lock-si" for your future Mississippi needs
Im glad this video was uploaded before my montly rewatch of eddie going insane at the rainforest cafe
unironically ate this video up (much like you ate up that margeritaville food)
Yaaaaas i was just wondering when we'd get another glorious video!
Oh no not again
What about the one in bossier city la
Hey Eddy, how can I pay to access your feet pics. Asking for a friend...
I admire your commitment to the scientific method
Nah the rainforest cafe video was not a year ago, I refuse to believe it
as a member of the jimmy buffett cult and proud owner of margaritaville brand crocs, thank you for your service
American culture is disgusting
I didn’t know about Jimmy Buffet’s lifestyle until this video- I now know everything there is to know about it.
Do my knowledge the thing is real
Take a swig of your margarita everytime eddy mentions feet or toes in this video (you will get alcohol poisioning)
45:40 what can I say except everything better in Canada lol
You know what they say, nothing goes together like road trips and alcohol!!!  Also, Syracuse having the worst location sounds very accurate….
Next do another themed restaurant with under 30 locations in the us and Canada!!! That's my favorite
when have you ever not pulled off a hat
Do every Portillo's. No balls, you wont
this feels a bit familiar
I live in Biloxi it’s so cool that you came here
anticipating the medieval times road trip of 2024
you're gonna do a third one
This is the greatest day of my life.
I love the RainForest Cafe Videos, Loved this one too :)
Margarita Ville also have a Cruise ship 🚢 Do that next.
ahh yes the dead stopped traffic of my home city. <3 love you atlanta .
waiting for the day eddy finally snaps
That arcade game could also be called "Stigmata Feet"
Hoping the drinking-around-the-world-at-Epcot video that we see hints of here is coming… 😂
Horrible experience at the Destin, Florida location. We sat down at about 7 pm. Took 30 min to receive drinks. We waited 1 hr and 30 min for our food. The food never came. We couldn’t even find our server to let her know we weren’t waiting anymore. Supposedly the kitchen staff quit around 7:30pm and left. One of the female servers she had to dodge glass and food that was thrown at her by the kitchen staff. We weren’t sure of that night they were short staffed and took on too many diners at once, but it was a bad experience
Eddy, im sorry but I think you missed one.  The Original Margaritaville 212 Fremont Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 Im not sure if its "cannon" since its named "The Original" Margaritaville but thought you should know.
The raw purity in these places makes me sad knowing how little of them we have
IVE BEEN TO THE DESTIN ONE
Try McDonalds next
do bubba gump next
I live in Miami and have been to Bayside(where the Margaritaville is) so many time but NEVER once even realized that was there until watching this video. Thanks for that Eddy but also sorry about the battle ur tummy fought on this trip.
Why did you travel with a pickup truck?
This is absolutely amazing
If only Cheeseburger and Paradse was still open...
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next???
Hard Rock Next ? 34 in the US  2 in Canada
Eddie is actually short for “Edmund Hillary of shitty chain restaurants”
You kept saying "final trip like this."  Does that mean the next one is to every Hard Rock Cafe in the WORLD to complete the trilogy?
the fact u weren’t vomming all over urself for half the trip is impressive
Americans will see the most stunning spot of land god bestowed upon them just to build a looney toons ass town right in the middle of it all.
Eddie what the fuck
Looking forward to the third time you do this
That's some soup strainer you've got going there Jimmy burback
i love that the employees went out of their way to make sure you got to eat there that’s just precious just so kind
This can't be your last one! You have to do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co!!!
at least Oklahoma has one good thing, our Margaritaville
went to the cleveland margaritaville after pride. sat in the boat it was a spiritual experience
The sudden rainforest cafe clips had me crying laughing. Fantastic video man so glad I subbed!
As someone whose from north florida I loved seeing you visit and hearing you speak about the beautiful scenery & beaches!! BUT im also glad you were forced to drive in the very severe thunder storms that occur here and spoke about that aspect, too. within an hour itll go from bright & clear -> pouring down so hard you cant see two feet in front of your car -> sunshine and rainbows again. My grandma always used to say: "Its Florida, if you don't like the weather, just wait 45 minutes." the beaches, flora, and fauna are all beautiful here but the weather is brutal!!
Would they do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next?
see you next year for the hard rock cafe video🫡
Eddy why did you do this
Eddy. Why do you keep doing this?! I say as I grab my lunch and get ready to watch this entire almost hour long video.
QUICK WE NEED MORE OBSCURE AND LOW QUANTITY RESTAURANTS!
The Biloxi pronunciation took me out
Needs more animotronic gorillas
Absolute mad man
Do it again
I don’t know how this happened, but I literally just rewatched the two rain forest cafe videos from last year 2 hours before this came out. It’s fate I suppose.
I got a karaoke machine when I was 9 and for some reason, out of all the songs, I would sing Margaritaville over and over again.
IM NOT AFRAID ANYMORE!!! YOU HEAR ME, JIMMY?!?! IM NOT AFRAID ANYMORE!!!
Next year, Bubba Gumps
I'm excited for next summer when they go to every Applebee's in the US and Canada
Didnt you forget the one in Houston
He's gotta go to every fudruckers next year
Dear god i can't believe you did it again
I’m so happy I ask Ted about this a Twitch Con.
Margaritaville? NO I margaritaWONT 🥶🥶
But.. why?
Wait I thought there was one near Houston and one in Lake Charles?
23 Bubba Gump locations next year????
Love it.  I think next challenge should be spend a lot of time at one place instead of many places.  Maybe a month at Dolly wood?
Ive never had fish and chips that didnt make me nauseous
Time for mcdonalds
you missed the one at lake of the ozarks missouri
Eddy, there's a margaritaville in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Looking forward to the follow up video.
I lived in NY my whole life and worked in Times Square for a while and I had NO idea there was a Margaretville there
One in Fort Myers beach… opens in just a couple months. Resort and restaraunt
Congratulations on a great video, and on completing what was obviously a very challenging task. I can't imagine how much work goes into producing a video like this. You should be very proud.
he runnin out of ideas?
They end it in front of a Planet Hollywood.... Just saying.............
everyone on the planet needs to visit buccees. yes it is kinda a cult but it’s a fun one
eating at every chuck - e - cheese
call that jimmy buffet
You should eat at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. location in the US next. There’s 26 of them.
Damn I used to work at the Margaritaville hotel in Pensacola and you skipped it
YOU WERE IN FUCKING DESTIN??? FUCK MAN FUCK.
It’s a masterpiece
Ive only ever been at the myrtle beach one.  I thought they all had that margarita tornado
I love the different vibes between this and the last one, where now Eddy is enjoying himself and having fun and Ted is having his soul yanked out through his eyesockets.
I really hope Eddy will do a Bubba Gump video. THAT will really showcase our American culture for the world.
Glad to know the only I've ever been to was the original
We were so excited to see you go to the Margaritaville in Bossier City Louisiana. Turns out its just a casino and the restraunt is actually named Jimmy's Seafood and Steak lmao.   Also was so jarring everytime you said Biloxi 😂
You missed one
HOLY SHIT THE THING
My brother actually works on the pirate ship that he saw in Destin, FL!
EDDY!! YOU FORGOT THE CAPITOLA SANTA CRUZ LOCATION!! THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS INVALID AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
NOT THE FUCKING CAT IN THE HAT RIDE OMG!!!! My sisters and I always go when we are at universal bc its the funniest thing ever. Also there is never a line and we are impatient.
You don't learn from your mistakes!! I'm so proud of you
THE ONLY SEQUEL WE EVER NEEDED
Damn I wish I could do this just for vacation
my jaw dropped when I saw the title. I just rewatched rainforest Cafe. 2 DAYS AGO. Eddy you're a champ
Fuck yeah Eddy I’ve been waiting so long for your return!!!!
Eddy you God Damn mad man
Ya guys missed the worst margaritaville in lake ozark Missouri
I love that this is a travel vlog, but it's caused by visiting unique chain restaurants
The fact that you went to The Thing, something that has been in my since forever, literally did not expect that lol.  Its the worst roadside attraction that I only went to once as an adult after an entire childhood of seeing the spooky "The Thing" signs. Safe to say I was dissapoonted lol.
There’s a MargaritaVille being built 5 minutes from my house..  you’ll have to come down here when they finish
love the random chicago man excited at the brothers burback
why
Ladies and gentlemen he’s done it again
I grew up in PCB/Destin and I’ve never been to Margaritaville but in middle school I had an alcoholic neighbor who would get wasted in his backyard tiki bar, grill burgers and make me listen to Jimmy buffet on repeat while reading the CD inserts to assure that I could grasp the genius in his lyrics.. so I feel like that was basically the same thing
“The day you had self reflection was the day you had diarrhea?!”
Okay cool now do every Bubba Gump's
Man I can’t wait for next year when they decide to go to Hard Rock Cafe
I didn't know Jimmy Fallon had a restaurant
Eddy you mad lad! What next, every Hard Rock Cafe? Skeeball at every Dave and Busters?
Ted looking like a confused little boy in the giant Margaritaville chair that he *thunks* back against, wearing THE THING t-shirt at 12:05 has to be the epitome of this whole godforsaken endeavor.
yo i went to the times square margaritaville! the best thing about the experience was the marvel characters you could see from the windows.
I want Jimmy to see this video
Hate to do this to ya but you should try to do every midevil times lol
This video and the rainforest cafe video perfectly encapsulate the insanity that comes from eating at a college dining hall every single god damn day.
God's greatest soldier (Eddie) valiantly fought and overcame God's greatest war (tummy ache)
A FOLLOW UP TO MY FAVORITE YOU TUBE VID OF ALL TIME?!
LET'S GOOOO ❤
day 8..he already lost it
Why do you keep doing this to yourself 😂
🎶cheeseburger in paradiise🎶
why would you do this to yourself again
you gotta go to landshark now
I hate to say it, but you’re going to have to keep this theme up haha thanks for content
Glad Syracuse was the worst Margaritaville, we never disappoint.
next year all 35 Hard Rock Cafes?
Some men dare to persevere through grueling journeys for greatness. Still others do so for mediocre chain food. Today you achieved both.
Dang guys, you forgot one. In Conroe, TX. I guess good job but definitely an asterisk on this one
MY BOII IS BACK
I can’t wait for every chilies
Y'all gotta do Bubba Gump next
As someone who lives near "The Thing," seeing it featured in an Eddie Burback video felt like a fever dream
I’ve always loved the tropical atmosphere of Cleveland and Lake Erie
imagine how easy this trip would be if america caught up with the rest of the modern world and build some high speed rail connecting thier citizens instead trapping them if they’re poor like some other dictatorial countries i won’t name. but instead america is focused on fucking over and erasing trans people. very productive 👍
Wow, you really learn some new and interesting facts with these restaurant videos. I had no idea that Eddy’s full name was actually Deep Eddy Burback.
Thank you for your service good sir, your sacrifice will not go unnoticed🫡🫡
Next year: visiting every McDonald’s in the world!
Shout out to that Texan fan who managed to stalk you undetected for an entire year.
So is Bubba Gumps next?
Ive been tripping this whole time and I think I figured it out
Man. What an experience. Sorry about the gorilla PTSD.
Is Planet Hollywood next? haha
I'm from Florida and I HATE the rain!
As a person who’s parents love Jimmy Buffet (we went to his latest concert tour) this is by far the best thing I could’ve waken up to.
this video gave me sympathy diarrhea
This is self destructive
Now go to every Hard Rock Cafe… Unless, you’re too scared 👀
Now you just gotta do Medieval times (when the strike ends)
Edward! Why doth you still bestow upon yourself further suffering? Have you not learned from your faults of the past?!
coolest motherfuckers on the planet
This was a great video, Deep Eddy.
You missed the Margaritaville in Conroe 🥺
As someone from FL, the Panama location has the plane lovingly because he was SHOT DOWN in his younger years.  Every 30 minutes, a giant confetti shower use to shoot down on you violently with gunshots and salt.
57:18 Foreshadowing to eating at every Planet Hollywood next year? 😅😅
Audibly said "shut the fuck up" when this popped into my feed. Love this series, can't wait for the next installment
The biggest mistake you've made is making your audience expect your audience expect you to go to every medieval times this time next year
Living my dream
What I’ve learned from this series is that eddy is very susceptible to brain washing
As someone who went to Margaritaville  for the first time in Atlantic City last week, this is exactly what I needed today
eddy i hate to tell you this but there is a margaritaville in missouri that you missed ://///////
So excited for Bubba Gump next summer!!
The lifelessness of the Margaritaville in Syracuse reflects the energy of the rest of the city
do every medieval times in the country lol
The commitment is insane
Next year: “We went to every McDonald’s in America!”
"i think that's coooool as hell"
I’m confused by the fact that there is a margaritaville hotel/casino in my city and he DEFINITELY didn’t go to that one
Rated E, for Eddie & Ted.
"My body is literally telling me I'm going to die if I eat another bite of Margaritaville, but the vibes make that okay😂."
What if… TED DID IT
Now every Dennys in the US
Loving this arc of the eddyverse
Can’t believe you didn’t mention the margaritaville musical!!
I’ve been praying for a video like this
They actually did it, the mad lads did it again
This is the ultimate series, I love love love this stuff.
again? are you okay?
Next video: I’m going to all the McDonald’s locations around the world 😂
Petition for the next series to be Bubba Gump Shrimp 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽
Next up: Going to every mcdonalds in america
Okay but hear me out. There's only 22 Bubba Gump Shrimps in America
Eddy slowly losing his mind while Ted finds inner peace is exactly the energy i needed for this trip. Jimmy bless you both
What happened to the Pensacola and Jacksonville locations??
he should do McDonald’s next
My cousin actually worked for Jimmy Buffet and he is extremely nice to his workers.
I can't wait for every buc-ees
That's Georgia hospitality.
RIP to Margaritaville in New Orleans and thank you for supporting my cousin, the great Jimmy Buffet
A little late for pride month, but I like the commitment to a bit
45:00 You don’t go to Syracuse as a tourist. You just drive through and come out the other end depressed.   Also attractions only in a mall that is totally empty, with subpar food? That sounds like the upstate NY that I was born and raised it! ❤
Why are you doing this to yourself
Go to every chili’s I dare you
That one guy looked exactly like Jarvis Johnson
You better know how to drive stick shift, cuz how about 24 days riding me?
Also Ted is beginning go feel like you did back during the RFC trip
Glad he got to experience this before the Jimmy Buffet accident of November 23 2024
Better than anything on the Travel Channel
I live in El Paso, earleir this year my wife and I went to a concert in Phoenix and on the way back we kept seeing the signs for "The Thing". We almost stopped to check it out, now I really wish we had, thanks for showing!
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
Ridiculous. Do it again.
yeah that cat in the the hat ride has traumatized generation of Orlando kids
Why blur the feet?
you fell off
This man had to go to the worse city on the East Coast twice, I feel bad he went AC twice
i hope one day sc can replace hootie and the blowfish as our name to fame with the micro celebrities that go to margaritaville
Eddy no Eddy y Eddy stop Eddy im srry
What the hell is a Margaritaville?
Eddie is trying to 100% life
Alright, next year, go to all 1600 applebees locations
uh oh... idk if anyone was asking for a second one of these, but now that theres 2 i just gotta have a 3rd one
i love that last year ted was the energetic one and eddy was depressed and absolutely done with the trip, and this year eddy was enthusiastic and ted was the one ready to go home😭
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
When you got to pigeon Forge, you got a shot of my car lol
What made you think going to Mississippi was a great idea it sucks here
I've been to one of these in Chicago and it was more annoying than fun. I couldn't understand why they are popular. Thanks Eddie
imagine: jimmy doesn't actually like margaritas.... 😢
I hate running but people have sworn to me that it stops sucking at a point and you get something called a "runner's high" even though I think it's bullshit. It appears that Ted has experienced a Margaritaville high in the same vein. He has broken through and was able to reach nirvana.
The classical music in the into. <chef's kiss>
Eddy...
Eddy in 2043: I went to every McDonald’s in the country
You guys missed one in ATL. There are 2.
Keep missing when hes at MoA
Seeing Atlanta was on the list i felt ao bad. There should be signs warning how bad traffic is. But man, shoutout to that manager that let you guys in when the kitchen was closed.
i’m from the south and am so used to hearing biloxi pronounced like billucksee hearing Eddy pronounce it bill-loxy was a shock to the system
dont ask me why, idfk, but the rainforest cafe video is my favorite youtube video and my biggest comfort. So this new video is a fucking mirale. thank you for uhhh fucking up your mental health for my enjoyment
I went to The Thing 10 years ago while on a trip back from kartchner caverns state park. The aliens/dinosaurs section wasn't there back then! It used to be just the paper mache mummy and a few mannequins in old timey scenarios.
Do every McDonalds in the US and Canada next
I can't wait for next year's road trip episode :)
Next year is Bubba Gumps? 😂
Eddie noooooooooo
Eddy, as your gastroenterologist I appreciate that you plan on keeping me fully employed
Eddy.....is......BACK BABY
There's another one being built near Houston
I'm a new fan and I literally just finished watching the rainforest cafe video (yours and Teds! Lmao)
Do a video eating at every Starbucks
Wow.  You're living my dreams
This absolute madmen really did this again
There was actually a Margaritaville Broadway musical. It flopped horribly.
You guys should go to all of Guy Fieri's restaurants. Surely as a celebrity chef his restaurants \have\ to have good food. Lol
I think an editing mistake at 41:18
Ok, so since Eddie’s video has him loving the trip, I am guessing this time around Ted is going to be the one suffering.
The way you pronounced Biloxi is going to give me stress dreams
Man in constant denial of his road trip pains occasionally suffers jungle themed PTSD.
There’s Margaritavilles in Conroe Tx & Shreveport La, those are the only two I’ve been to and am sad y’all didnt go to either 🥲
i think he missed one a little north of houston in conroe, texas
So next you’re going to do all the Mellow Mushroom pizza chains right?
the absolute madman does it again
Season 3 needs to be Bubba Gump Shrimp
Someday, not this year, or the next, or even the next, but SOMEDAY... Eddy will go to *every* rainforest cafe in the *world*
didnt think id be logging back in for another 1 hour tour across one of the most iconic food chains in america  - but here I am .
Shout out to Syracuse Spencer’s
Eddy this cannot be the end, you must next conquer all Bubba Gump locations in the country
the usa are a fever dream
Eddy are you okay
PLEASE do NOT do this with Medieval Times. They are horrible and one of their locations is currently on strike. Listen to what mgt did when two locations were able to unionize, NJ and Buena Park:  “After the New Jersey location voted to become part of the union, Medieval Times gave a $1-an-hour raise to employees at every castle except New Jersey,” she said. “And after Buena Park unionized, management started giving knights a 25% raise, while others in the show cast got a 15% to 20% raise. That happened at every castle except Buena Park and New Jersey.”  Fuck them for literally forever.
i just watched the rainforest cafe episode and he releases this hours later
You're now obligated to invite Braden(?) on your  next hell adventure.
I've never been to the Wisconsin Dells of Dollywood, but I've been to Branson many times, and it feels exactly the same way. There's straight up exactly the same Titanic exhibit and Hollywood Wax Museum you showed in the video in Branson lmao
I went on that Cat in The Hat ride as a child and can confirm, that shit was terrifying.
Hate to tell you this buddy, but you missed ONE Margartiaville in Bossier City, Louisiana.  Have fun on your 3rd trip though!
I cannot wait to see what trip they will go next year!
Good thing you didnt take ted's truck, would have been hard to travel all that way while straddling a football-basketball shaped hole in the floorboards.
Thank you for opening my eyes to the fact that Margaritaville in Osage Beach, MO isn’t a properly licensed Jimmy Buffett establishment.
Wait so you were literally 20 min from my house in Mississippi... Wooooooow
Great vid. Please never pronounce Biloxi, the way you did.
Do bubba gump next
im glad you loved cleveland
omg you didnt mention the fake weather forecast and storm at the myrtle beach location as the giant descends from the hurricane and the blender whips up liquid
YESSSS
Missed the one in bossier city Louisiana but its not exactly an outstanding option
Why do they keep driving pickup trucks... they literally put shit in the bed instead of getting a car and putting it in the back seat. Wtf
Im sorry I have no idea who jimmy buffet is lol I guess I’m too Mexican to know
I hate my job, but it’s good to have some escapism watching someone hate their job way more than I ever will
How he best?
now i need a ranking
My biggest takeaway from this is that aliens are dummy thicc
Road trip 3: bubba gump's revenge
Olive garden next?
cant wait to see how far you gonna push it this time before insanity sets in
Do Rax - there’re only 3
Drew aggressively saying “IM NOT EATING DINNER RIGHT NOW” is amazingZ
No not this again😂
the times square one literally JUST closed down ! you guys went right on time
tell us how you detoxed from this 🤣
Imagine visiting Time Square and eating at Margaritaville (not for a YouTube video). What kind of person does that?
Why didn’t you visit the one at Isla Nublar?
I feel like this is the start of the eddy burback fall off. Lotta re hashed ideas lately, man.
You missed the margaritaville restaurant casino in Shreveport Louisiana! oh well you’ll get them next time
Every Waffle House next.
You Should do the  Guy Fieri Restaurants next year
Anyone else watching on the edge of your seat for him to eat at the Margaritaville near you
This is so well made and hilarious.. good show <3
Thank you eddy i just got my wisdom teeth removed and this is very helpful for recovery
Excited for the Wafflehouse After Dark Tour in 2024
didnt they make a song about this
you should be a guest on the mbmbam podcast they'd love you
El Paso !  I did not know that you were in my hometown
The way you pronounce Biloxi is so funny😅
Can't believe my favourite video has a sequel. Great time to be alive.
Sees title: Eddy... No... Not again...
morgan spurlock could never
Planet Hollywood ominously looms in your future
Go to every McDonald’s
my friends and i called this the sequel of the summer. thank you for your sacrifice, we are living vicariously through you two and your adventures
Since you've done this twice one year apart, this is an annual event now, right? The annual Eddy Burback soul-crushing roadtrip?
This video and the Rainforest Cafe ones from both you and Ted make me so incredibly happy. They're so good.
You missed the Margaritaville at Lake Lanier in GA
Why don't you Learn from the things you do to yourself?
peak Cinema is back
This video is inspiring me to get a margaritaville tattoo
We’re so back😤
The Tim Misny sign made me spray margarita out my nose, that dudes a legend in Ohio 😅
Do every mini golf course in the us
5:35 JORDAN!!!!!!!
So, Bubba Gump's 2024 tour?
I ate at both the rainforest cafe and the margaritaville in the mall of America and now it feels like eddy is following me
I hate to break it to you. You missed at least one in Missouri. It’s in Osage Beach.
Schlatt was in my hometown San Antonio??
I've been to 2 Margaritavilles, one was in Cleveland and the other one was in Canada. Haven't watched the video yet so not sure if you went to that one (it's in Niagara Falls) but assuming you didn't, you didn't really miss anything. It was very sub-par.  Edit: are you kidding me the meal I had at Niagara Falls Margaritaville was bland af (it was that one burger) and this was less than a month ago
Hear me out: You and Ted should do this a third time next year.
Eddy going into destiny USA without fearing for his life… what a beautiful thing
Ted has Stockholm Syndrome.
BIG missed opportunity not listening to Jimmy the entire trip. My parents are massive Parrotheads and his music is literally engrained into my brain wrinkles. I went to his concerts when I was WAY too young to be at them. As a musician myself, he truly has some great songwriting underneath the party exterior. I have a feeling his tunes would have enhanced your trip…. or not. HA!
If you keep this up, I will legitimately call my first son Eddy Bareback.
Thanks for helping me procrastinate work just a little longer..... Watched every second......great video
Dude the things you put yourself through…. Kudos and great video 😅
You're living my dream man. I envy you in a way words fail to describe.
margaritaville crocs
Ty eddy for reminding me I went to margaritaville in Panama when I was little, I would’ve never known about the great jimmy😞
Absolutely loved the rainforest video and loved this one too💜💜💜
You never went to the margarita vill in bossier city
holy shit another one!!
(not from North America myself)   Can't say I've ever heard about Margaritaville but I remember the trauma the whole Rainforest Cafe ordeal left on you (and thus me as a viewer) so colour me intrigued.
This can’t be the final time!!!
The emotional arcs that these videos go through is top tier entertainment. Love that it’s a series now.
“so i’ve gone to every subway in america”
I’d be interested to know about any changes in your vitals after these trips
THE I-85 AT A COMPLETE STANDSTILL LOLOLOL
I’ve watched the Rainforest Cafe video so many times so I love that you’ve done this again for us.
i too walked into a spencers for the first time, and walked right back out.   we shall never speak of the horrors we experienced in there.
How is there no buffet? That's like if McDonalds was founded by a guy named Jimmy Hotdogs.
We love Eddy for this lol
So... no Bubba Gump roadtrip?
Eddy's videos are so strangely comfy to watch, its like returning to your favorite sitcom over and over.
Bill-ux-see
watching you be on the river walk a place where i visit frequently being a texas native is wild to me as the wonder hasnt been dragged from you yet
Now waiting for the next year's roadtrip
Eddy, do you need therapy, buddy? Beause two huge road trips in one year is terrible.
My profile picture has never been more appropriate for a video.
Those okonite reels were probably headed to my work lol. Weird to see them in a video
"I didn''t know you could make an entire museum off a hypothetical scenario". It's actually worse, you can make an entire religion off it.
So next video is the yearling trip to every Cheesecake factory right?!
This is a great video for the Eddy Burback channel. If it were on a high quality channel it would be mediocre to kinda bad, but for now it’s hitting the spot
He didn’t have to do it again, but he did. He did this for us.
Dog..... a fucking 18 dollar grilled chicken sandwich... from a chain restaurant that 100% just microwaves them shits. BRUTAL.
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Company next
The blade runner reference at 52:55 made me bust up laughing
Babe wake up Eddy Burback travelled the country for a video again
I got stuck in the Margaritaville at Universal Studios Florida for 6 hours because of a Severe weather alert and everyone had to shelter in place we had power the only problem was I couldn't drink my sorrows away because I was 11 at the time, but let me tell you every 30 minutes when that volcano filled up and came crashing down and that fucking song played was my hell on earth. not only did I lose a day at universal but I was stuck with my extended family along with 200 other drunk strangers who went buck wild every-time the Margaritaville song played and all I could do was drink my Virgin Pina Colada's and let the madness take me. TO THIS DAY I REFUSE TO EAT AT ANY MARGARITAVILLE!!!!!!!!
46:32 Margaritaville MAKES them pay
Hard rock Cafe next?
you missed but one. there is a margaritaville in a Michigan airport with a limited menu. i had the cheeseburger in paradise and no joke, it wad one of the best burgers ive ever had. im only 16 so there might be better ones later in life, but dear god I'll never forget that burger
This video was fantastic and I loved every second thank you for doing this again
Oh my god he got the Tim Misny sign
9:34 a second saucer has hit the towers
You say that this is the second and final road trip to restaurants, but I think we all know that comedy is best in threes. I have a feeling that in the same time next year we'll see Eddy making a trip around the country to all the Bass Pro Fishing shops or something (those places have food or like bowling, right?)
Thats amazing
A tradition has been made today
Bro no one see there both drinking and driving across the country
I’m surprise he went to every rainforest cafe again/j
I love that you went to Syracuse. I grew up going to that mall and that Margaritaville is absolutely soulless.
How about The Original Margaritaville in Sandusky Ohio?
ah shittywok place has good chinese food
Ha ha he thinks this is the last time he’ll do this kinda video
Next up, every subway
Is "Bill-uhx-see" you silly goose   (Former South Mississippi resident)
Can’t wait to see what part 3 of this series is going to be
Fun fact key west is the main setting in one of jimmy buffets books I believe it was called “where is Joe merchant?”
crazy that weezer decided to visit the chicago bean
My dad passed suddenly in march, he loved jimmy buffet and I listened to the 2 disc Meet Me In Margaritaville my entire childhood. I even went to the myrtle beach margaritaville for my 13th bday, and I loved it. This made me think of him so much, and it was a wonderful “new” memory of the place and way to think about it. I haven’t been able to listen to a lot of my favorite music, or watch my favorite movies, or do a lot of things I used to retreat to because they remind me of dad.   Except this, this was really really amazing for me. Thank you so much dude, for this crazy insane idea and brilliant video. Gave me a big smile today.
See you next year for the Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Co. video
Theres one in boston? Did you do this years ago?
Eddie you know that next year you have to do Bubba Gump right?
more like jimmy buffeet
oh boy I can't wait until their road trip next year to all 35 Hard Rock Cafe locations in the US and Canada
Hard Rock Cafe next year??
Eddy why do you do this to yourself?
I wonder where they will go next year?
I usually go to PCB every year and the screen at 19:01 has been blue the past several years I've been there
you didnt even say the word Ohio
There is a Margaritaville in Jacksonville FL you guys missed.
When you get locked in a bathroom in a Margaritaville hotel just... jimmy the door.
Man are u ok
i can definitely read
Epic you should go to every McDonald’s next
Cheeseburger In Paradise is another restaurant chain by Jimmy Buffet. Ours closed down.
Everyone likes to talk about existentialism. You truly embraced the concept my friend. If there is no inherent point to life, you might as well spend your time doing some random shit.
You missed the Margaritaville at Lake Lanier Islands! But it actually doesn't have a Margaritaville restaurant confusingly enough but just like... the vibes at a waterpark? and the restaurant there is called Landshark? Amazing as always, Eddy
Wasn't expecting to learn margartitavilla was catholic like faith today
Next up: every Hard Rock Cafe in the USA/Canada! It will take them over 1/12 of their year
next is the mcdonald's episode
Eddy, you can’t keep doing this to yourself
No one tell Eddy that there is a Margaritaville cruise ship… He’s not gonna be very happy to find he hasn’t conquered Jimmy Buffet yet
you have to go on the margaritaville cruise ship now
Why do you keep doing this to yourself? Don't get me wrong I'm going to watch it but is it worth it?
I’m getting a second-hand stomachache from this
As soon as I saw this I’m just like “Oh, Eddie no :(“ and then the intro is playing showing the decor and I’m just like “Eddie whyyyy”   It’s so funny to me too, cause I’ve been wondering where you were. And now it makes sense 😭😭
bubba gump shrimp next, third times the charm
THE TIM MINSY BILL BOARDDDDDDDDDD
Saw the misney board and knew it was cleveland
Awwwww shhhhiiieeeeett HERE WE GO AGAIN :D
you missed the margaritaville in Houston:(
Part 3 is a chain that spans across Canada but only has a couple locations in the States ‼️
Next is every BK in the U.S.A
Damn Eddie if you needed a visitor for the Destin location that could’ve been meeeeeee. Amazing work!!
damn hope you checked out that sweet dollar pizza place across the street  while at margaritaville times square
Looked like that arcade had everything but video games and pinball, so would you really even call it an arcade. It's just what it was before, a gambling hall but this one is "family friendly".
These are so great. You give a lot for your videos and we salute you! What's next Planet Hollywood or Bubba Gump Shrimp? lol
Did you include the one inside the AIRPORT?!?!
You guys should eat at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country next
God I love this series
Eddys not the hero we needed, but he’s the one we got. And that’s ok I guess
Holding out for a Hard Rock Cafe tour!
Having a margarita everyday for 24 days straight is truly choosing violence
I love you Eddie!❤
I am liiiiiiving for these!!!!
WHO???! 😭😭😭
Eddy, you good sir deserve some Pepto-Bismol and a long night sleep… and after that you should bring Ted with you Eat at EVERY McDonald’s in Every City. Every state in the U.S.A. ❤
going back to rainforest cafe toward the end has to be the craziest case of stockholm syndrome i've ever seen
I can't believe you went to Pigeon Forge, and didn't go to Dollywood. Still, happy to see East Tennessee getting the love it deserves Great Video, can't wait to see you guys do Hard Rock Cafe
This is the best YouTuber tour of all time
As someone who lives there, Eddy's pronunciation of Biloxi drove me crazy.
I’ve been to the theme park in pigeon forge a couple of times when I would go to Tennessee for vacation. I remember seeing the Margaritaville building and wondering what went on in there. Now I know I suppose lol
So I'm hawaiian and I grew up in the southern California lu'au circuit and this feels like pulling back the curtain on a whole niche subculture you guys have no idea exists....
Wait, did he skip the one in Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri?
Ok now do Hard Rock Cafe. 34 in the US :)
Nice can't wait to see next year's video
Eddy&teddy visits every guy ferri restaurant next???
Love these. Please do another one! However you did miss the margaritaville on St Thomas (US Virgin island). I used to work there and jimmy buffet stops by sometimes
You guys should do the Forest Gump restaurants next!
Just need to go to every buba gump shrimp next
5:06 thats just in case Jimmy comes by
Dear god Eddy what have you created.
Next time medieval times 🤞🏼 or Hard Rock
As a designer for Margaritaville, I can say that I watched this video.
So glad that you stopped to see the greatness of Buc-ees
Say it with me now:  “I ate at every Cracker Barrel in the country.”
Eddie, i think you need to stop hanging out with Ted.
The amount of dedication he has to do this with Rainforest Cafe and Margarita Ville is crazy
Next year, gotta do a tour of Dicks Last Resorts around the nation
til there's a margaritaville in canada, but also very not surprised that it's in niagara falls
That volcano bit is psychotic
I mean might as well make it a trilogy at this point
I watched rainforest cafe video relatively recent and seeing this video released 2 hours ago I thought this man went from rainforest cafes to margaritavilles is he okay? but nah they are more than a year apart so all good
Eddy you silly goose! You missed the margaritaville in the San Juan, PR airport!
Can’t wait for next year!
so many tummy ache casualties
Eddy why
Sweet, which restaurant next? :P
The sequel no one new was even necessary
Looking forward to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company road trip next summer!
hard rock cafe next?
There's something about seeing Eddy absolutely miserable that makes me happy. HARD ROCK CAFE TOUR 2024!
Okay what’s the next chain?
hard rock cafe next
Once you’re are going to die go to every McDonalds in the country
Can't wait for 2024's "I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the Country"
I'm extremely disappointed you walked past my work (Pigeon Forge) multiple times and I didn't even know it. However, I regret to inform you, YOU MISSED A LOCATION! Like 5 miles from the Pigeon Forge location in Gatlinburg. Guess you have to come back 🤷‍♀️
You forgot to do the cruise…..
We thank you for your sacrifice. ❤️ So proud of you for facing the Rainforest.
i hope your tumnmy is feeling better
My high school choir/band/orchestra trip this year was to Universal Studios Florida and our last meal in Florida was at the Margaritaville in citywalk, and we had this build your own burger thing in the upstairs seating area. It was really cool, and was a great way to leave off the trip.
I’m so sad they closed in Pensacola I would’ve loved to see y’all!!
THERE IS ANOTHER ONE
Go to every kitchen nightmare or bar rescue still open!
Definition of masochism
52:49 "You look like a good joe."
This is the silliest reason to go to Florida, and I don’t say that lightly
eddie as always, thank you for ur service 🫡
He does it again
now do mcdonald's
Do McDonald's next
My recent experience at Margaritaville ATL was terrible. Glad they threw you guys a bone. Also when were you there, just curious
Curious to why not go to the one in Shreveport, LA
No way eddie you drove right by my house i live like less than half a mile from a margaritavile
I was about to say Eddy should go to all the Chuck E' Cheese but there's over 468...
Eddy I love you.
why were the aliens caked up 😳
Bubba Gump next?
Was that your first time seeing Spencer’s?
You son of a bitch....I'm in!
Im convinced that if Eddy becomes an alcoholic its either because he drank too much on this trip and couldnt stop or it to re live the times in florida from this trip
i imagine that eddy hates the moa now
Omg thank you for going and seeing THE THING....? Theres a whole bunch of those signs around my area and now I wont be wondering lol
I watched this thinking "I could probably also eat at every Margaritaville for a month straight. I wouldn't even have tummy aches like this guy did." But that's just the hunger talking. Unless?
I need to see Ted and eddy go to every DICKS last resort restaurant in the country for more tourism themed restaurants
Thank you for your service.
who the fuck is this jimmy guy
Art
The sequel we didn't know we needed. Thank you
TIM MISNY
So weird seeing the mall I frequent in a youtube video. XD Yeah, the Margaritaville in Destiny is horrible. I'm surprised it's still open tbh. Every time I've gone to the mall, it's been empty.
Now for Hard Rock Cafe???
she jimmy on my buffet till i margaritaville
W
The ending of this video was genuinely sweet and wholesome
the sequel no one expected but everyone absolutely wanted.
Can't wait for next year when you and Ted go to every Hard Rock Cafe.
fastest click of my life
You should do it again with the bubba Gump restaurants
How come you didn't go to the one in Lake Conroe?
SAN ANTONIO MENTIONED
You beautiful beautiful man
Bubba gumps next year
You missed San Diego... They have a hotel that just opened...
a new “i ate at every ________ in the country (and canada!)” for me to rewatch 20 times, awww,  you shouldn’t have
oh yea the stop on the highway is just everyday atlanta traffic. so sorry you had to experience that 😂
I don’t think I’ve ever clicked on a video faster
I saw one of those Stinky Feet arcade games in a thrift store for $500 once.
Hope you found your lost shaker of salt
The thing museum sounds amazing tbh
My dream trip. Glad I can watch someone else do it while I sit here at work.
The Universal Orlando Margaritaville is the bane of my existence. I worked security at USO for 2 years and the gate right next to that restaurant was a frequent spot of mine. I never want to hear the live version of Margaritaville ever again or I might scream.
Um… you missed Margaritaville lake resort in lake of the ozarks :( wth dude I work there how could you
Now do medieval times you cowards
getting stuck on I-20 on your way into Atlanta is the most Southern experience I've ever seen
this video was so good i would watch it again, but i already know what happens, so i won't
Was it Jimmy’s warm hands calming you down from breaking…or the margs???? Who’s to say
wow, I can't wait for next year's Bubba Gump Shrimp Company roadtrip
Glad y'all got a little taste of Southern Hospitality in Atlanta. Wish you could've experienced this exceptional city a little more, but, you had Margaritavilles to be at, so I get it.
The high school sentiment of going there once and leaving as soon as possible is too relatable
i can’t wait until the follow up where you guys drive to Turks and Caicos
Next challenge! Come and visit every wetherspoons in England!
do mcdonalds next
The manager of that margaritaville knew what was up.
Oh dear god not Destiny Mall. The only thing it has going for it is the ease of access of I-90 but god bless you for going.
Insanity is doing the exact... same thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That.  Anyway, thanks for the vid!
Next year you need to go to all 35 Hard Rock Cafes in the U.S and Canada.
Hard Rock Cafe next?
The straw roof boats in destin look like something I would make in totk
Ted has the most dad energy I have ever seen
BUC-EES let's gooooo!!!
Dollywood video
Jesus ... is your trust-fund ok?
I hope he eventually goes to every theme park one day
can't wait to see y'all next year
Did you ever find the lost shaker of salt?
Did I expect and want you to make another road trip like this? No. Did I click on this video the second I saw it and loved every second of it? Absolutely
the margaritaville in cleveland has been there for me in my ~times of need~ on a night out more than i care to admit
How'd you pass up on the beautiful Margaritaville in Tulsa, Ok?
Please do Bubba Gump Shrimp next year
BRO I GET A WHOLE ASS EDWARD BRUBACK VIDEO ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥😬😬😬🧊🧊🧊🥶🥶🥶📸📸📸🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
Ah yes a cleveland classic: the horrifying no context tim misny sign
U r ok....
pissed there's not a buffet called the "Jimmy Buffet"
Ted was found dead today
shoutout to the Tacoma, a trusty steed
That son of a b*tch he did it again!
17:20 "You're the king? I'M THE KING"
My family drove to arizona years ago and we had to see the thing because of the 100s of signs. I’ve never seen anyone talk about it thank u🙏
I literally threw my arms up and cheered when the twist came lmao
"Bill-lox-e" haha "Bill-lux-ee" 14:26
everything jimmy lee wants but jimmy buffet has
He’s a legend
Lmaooo I’ve also been to the “The Thing” museum, very educational 🙏🏻
fun fact about the atlanta margaritaville: it destroyed the studio where the first country song was recorded. a historical landmark was destroyed for a margaritaville
Eddie did someone hold you at gunpoint?  Why did you subject yourself to this experience again, nobody was asking you to suffer like this twice 😭
Eddy can I pay for the toes
These videos are art, masterpieces, cinematography incarnate, please MORE
Next summer is Hard Rock or Bubba Gumps?
The aliens doing 9/11 is a conspiracy that I am surprised I've never heard before until now 9:30
You missed the Margaritaville on lake Conroe in Texas! Gotta do it again
Here we go again
Dante's Inferno
Again Eddy? Again?
I FUCKING KNEW YOU WERE ABOUT TO DROP AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!!! So happy that you tortured yourself for views again :D
I’m convinced Ted holds a gun to your head
Lol he thinks this will be the final time
A masterpiece
Do hard rock cafe next
Pigeon Forge, TN is like home to me, this makes me so happy to see them go there! 😄❤️🍹
Can’t wait for every Applebee’s
I appreciate the San Antonio love Eddy!
"Going to every Starbucks only to use the toilet" coming soon?
Immediately yes. Immediate click
Predicting Eddy is gonna discover how insane the cult of Jimmy Buffet is.  Edit: Looks like he decided to join it.
The cat in the hat ride is like a bad acid trip
You need to do this a 3rd time to complete the trilogy
Don't we technically pay you in ad revenue?
Where will they go next year 🤔
My condolences to Eddy's sanity
Your writing for this restaurant tour format was already fun last year but it’s even more engaging and well-paced now. Well done Eddy.
He cant keep getting away with this
I liked when the volcano burped :)
Commenting for algorithm
Honestly, most places in Destiny USA are kinda trashy and expensive 😔
"The day you had diarrhea is the day you had self reflection?"     Isn't that always the case?
The great thing about being a Floridian is that at any day you're out boating anywhere near Palm Beach you could just run into Jimmy on the water lol
is this what it’s like to become justin mcelroy?
So happy you guys got to see so much of south Florida!!!<3
I hope bucee eats you in your sleep for naysaying him >:c
McDonalds next
The whole alien sidetrack had me enthralled
It's weird how both the margaritaville and rainforest café in Canada were better than the rest
The shot after the second Margaritaville to the rainforest cafe restaurant with the PTSD shot just absolutely sent me.
Why he skip the Conroe, TX Resort??
time for every bubba gump in the country
For god's sakes Lemon, we'd all like to flee to the Cleve
as a jimmy buffet enthusiast, thank you for this <3
Did they forget the Capitola CA Margaritaville?
Eddy burback eats around the US so I gotta watch it
I better see a patreon page with an uncensored toe cut of this video, Eddy 😤
I'm shook, I came up with this idea after the last video. Can't believe you beat me to it!
can you do every subway in the states and canada
Poor Ted had to drive a Tacoma without a hole in the passenger side😢
mcdonalds next
Nothing says relaxed beach vibes like millions of tons of steel megaliths in the heart of NYC
SYRACUSE MENTIONED‼️
He’s returned
you should have weighed yourself before and after
You pronounced Biloxi wrong lmao
loved the last vid and going to love this one even more, please make this a semi regular series!
You missed the one in Shreveport LA
As a Canadian, I couldn't be more glad that you got to experience our biggest accomplishment: Margaritaville Niagara Falls
The legend is back and he’s done it again! The Pensacola Margaritaville and the Galveston Rainforest Cafe are personal favorites 🥰🥰
Lmao the only thing keeping scurvy out of this trip was the citric acid in those margaritas
He can't keep getting away with this!
Mans be lookin like Weezer in front of the bean
Ouchie🥲
It is INSANE I showed my wife the rainforest cafe video yesterday, and this drops today 😭 bless you baby jesus
When are we gonna get eddy eats at every taco bell in the country
Why do you keep doing this to yourselves
another banger from Deep Eddy Burback
Sandwidge
this is american culture
OMG PLEATES! :D
Lol I don't know why everyone says that about the cat in the hat ride. As a Floridian that has always loved Universal it was always a favorite of mine 😂😂😂 maybe that says something about me
next year do mcdonalds
When I saw the title I, out loud, said “Oh no. Not again”
Why
Divorceddadcore
Can’t believe you’re wasting away again in margaritaville
I was wondering if Chrissy’s song inspired this video haha
two years straight of going into the Canadian location of the restaurant in Niagara Falls and enjoying it. Speaking from experience: the food's expensive at most of the restaurants near the Falls, but they're typically well worth it.
seems doable and even pleasant for a parrothead like me
caitlyn rae better be in these comments somewhere
I dare you to hit every McDonalds
Whats next? every Mcdonalds in the country?
How very American  Goes to rent a car, chooses the least practical option because its a truck, and a more fitting estate car being the best option for the job is just not going to cut it 😂
Ah the long awaited sequel, we are blessed on this day
Advertising loan services to your audience is like advertising weapon sales to a war torn african country.  Is this some kind of satire?
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. next year. Great news the it is also right next to the rainforest café in the mall of America. Similar vibe, but you get to make a bunch of Forest Gump jokes.
"The day you had self-reflection is the day you had diarrhea!?" 😅
next year eddy goes to all 660 cracker barrel locations
The thing! A classic, I-10's second biggest disappointment
Do every McDonald’s in America next
I think you missed margaritaville lake resort on lake conroe in texas. or does it not count? (i only mention it b/c i went there and was excited to see you go lol)
We love you eddy hope your colon is okay 😂
NOT THE HOTEL IN JAX BEACH?!? LOL
Eddie Burbank, the hero America never knew they needed.
This is probably the most american video I've ever seen. Honestly I got sick imagining what the food would be like.
I've never heard of this place and now I've heard way too much
Now to complete the trifecta, next year you do the Hard Rock Cafe
It’s crazy to think eddy burback went to a restaurant I went to a few days ago
eddy, you gotta do the margaritaville cruise to get the full experience
Haha, as a European I just found out about Margaritaville when watching the show Jury Duty. And now I realize I actually passed a location when I was in Hollywood.
Eddie please stop doing these. For my own sanity, if not yours.
I stopped at that what if museum a few years ago on my way to Sedona
Biloxee
Universal Orlando Passholder here, the Cat in the Hat Ride grows on you with time. The fever dream aspect of it doesn’t go away though.
I'm from Hollywood Fl and i'm so glad you enjoyed your stay!!! I've never stayed at the hotel we have, but I go up and down the broadwalk all the time- i hope you guys explored it cause it's really fun. It's so crazy that you guys were literally thiiiisss close to me! Love your videos and your editing, you're very good at making a video about stuff that I don't care about but still enjoy :) p.s: sorry about the thunderstorms, that's florida summer for you :/
Eddie tell us who is making you do this. I want names!!!
The son of a bitch did it...
Caroline Konstnar would be proud of you for your disciplined attitute to showing your feet for free. Respect.
seems like you love seafood maybe u should try the 23 NA bubba gumps
I can only think of Jury Duty whenever I see Margaritaville now 😭
Impatiently waiting for teds video to drop
I went to the University of Miami and Jimmy Buffett was my graduation speaker! I've always found that fact quite funny, and Margaritaville holds a special place in my heart.
Do Caribbean breeze next!!
Last time I tried to go to the bean, someone shot themselves, so they closed off the area
The Bucee’s nightmare sequence was so true fr
Truly the best Barbie-Oppenheimer Pregame the world could ask for. Best weekend ever
Eddy you madman
Margaritaville is the only restaurant to give me violent food poisoning. Condolences to your colon.
Another sacred pilgrimage
waiting for the video where you go to every hard rock casino, hotel and cafe
17:22 ohhhh god that sounds really really horrible out of context
I grew up on key west and used to sit with my mom selling jewelry in front of the margaritaville and this put such a huge smile on my face just to see a little bit of my childhood again. I miss the nachos 😂
i work at islands of adventure and there was one day I saw someone and thought "wow that guy looks like eddy burback! anyway-" and moved on just watched this video and realized I did, in fact, see eddy burback and just thought it was some other guy.
THE FUCKING THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IVE PASSED THOSE BILLBOARDS!!!!1
i'm so glad i'm not the only one traumatised by the cat in the hat ride
As a Chicagoan I can confirm whenever we feel sad we all go to the bean and chant *bean bean bean* frantically
So glad jshlop could make it into the video
I clicked on this instantly because I live in Syracuse and I knew it would be the worst lol. I grew up near the Gulf and the vibes are just incompatible
this is the road trip movie we all needed.. the twists and turns.. the drama
Do cracker-barrel next
ok but now do every mcdonalds
Now we wait for next year
Doing it once is insane, doing it twice; that should be a crime
Eddy, for the love of God, pay for the therapist. You do not need to do this.
Hard Rock Cafe When?
Ted's genuine but evil little smile when Eddy asked if he wanted to go to Rainforest Cafe was weirdly heartwarming...?? maybe I'm just more mentally ill than I thought but I almost cried because of that. Just wanted everyone to be aware of that.
52:46 Margiritaville 2049
Every couple of months this funny man with a mustache posts a banger of a video, and I’m lovin it
No way, I just finished watching the rainforest cafe video 🤯
i got an unusual sense of pride seeing them go to the cleveland margaritaville, even as he complained about how unbelievably tough the chicken was i was like “yeah, that’s home ❤️”
What about the one in the US Virgin Islands? I would consider that the USA as well.
Not going to lie, it was really awesome to see Eddy explore DUSA, but only because I live there. (not going to say which floor tho) Still sad to see it's clear slow decline tho.
So excited to see Ted mentally unravel in like two weeks lol
Destiny USA is crazy yall are lucky you werent robbed lmaoooo
Give me one margaritaville imma
You're insane
You missed the very 1st Margaritaville in Sandusky, Ohio before Jimmy Buffett had the trademark on the name. Still exists and has a scenic waterfall view.
Kinda fucked up you decided to get Key Lime Pie at a Margaritaville, but not from the one that's actually in the Florida Keys.
Worst part about this video is how Eddy pronounces Biloxi. It's Bi-lux-i not Bi-locks-i. 😢
48:23 and 48:29   Weezer
Why do this to yourself?
you should go to every space aliens in the US
Amazing video but every time I hear Biloxi "bill-oxy" it sends uncontrollable anger through my heart
As someone who lives in San Antonio, I love that Eddie loves the Riverwalk😂
"I can make a beach out of anything"  pure gold
Actually, I clicked on the video thinking “Oh my god, he did it AGAIN?!”
The fact that eddy and ted got to experience The Thing in Arizona is so funny
Currently stuck at home with the flu, bored as hell but too zonked to focus on actual movies or TV. You can't even begin to understand how much I needed this, Eddie.
Pan-na-MAH, Eddy. Not panamuh
Eddie undoubtedly gettin IBS for our pure entertainment in this niche genre, is the definition of a hero 🥲
Eddy you are one of the wonders of the world for this one 😎
noooo not again
fun fact about Destiny USA: it's so big it has its own zip code
I haven’t gotten all the way through yet but I’m happy this one seems like happy and culty trauma instead of scary wartime trauma
The fucking mad man is at it again
So, how much you want for those toes Eddy?
YOU’RE LIVING MY DREAM
“The second and final time”  So Hard Rock Cafe next year?
I can't wait to see how you complete the trilogy. Dick's Last Resort? Bahama Breeze? Bubba Gump Shrimp Companies? I'm dying to find out.
This is so exciting
Do not all of the Margaritaville resorts have a Margaritaville cuz they just opened a resort at South Padre Island a couple months ago lol
danny greg
Next year; "I Ate at Every McDonald's in North America"
Preemptive comment. I hope you got to go to the Biloxi location after they opened the amusement park
Buc-cees is insane, i stopped at one on x-mas eve last year, it was packed to the gills, and there was a dude in a buccees mascot costume They have really good pulled pork sandwiches though 🤤
history will remember them as "roommates"
Do Bubba Gump next
We were just there last week! I think in.. Port Bolivar, Texas?
I haven’t watched the video yet. But my prediction is that he is going to thoroughly enjoy this experience
Better than the original, I love Ted's discomfort with not using his truck that he used to drive himself to high school with and I love Eddy's trauma with last year's trip.
You missed the Margaritaville Hotel in Jacksonville Beach, you will be hearing from my lawyer Mr. Burback
This is living
Omg it's like Christmas morning to see this video uploaded.
The long awaited sequel 👀
Oh eddy you still have Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump to go
This definitely seems like payback for the rainforest cafe road trip
Eddie you guys missed one
Ok im 4 minutes into this video and so far it's actually a copy paste of the other video and I can't tell if it's funny
I'm hoping Edward's annual cross-country food trip is a tradition that keeps going, this and the Rainforest Cafe one were both so fun.
eddy got his revenge on ted by reading jimmy’s book in the car
This makes me never want to eat at a restaurant again
Haven't even started watching and I've fuckin pumped let's gooooo
There will be Margaritaville in Boston, Eddy? I'm going back to Boston on August 2nd to go to Fenway Park seeing a Fall Out Boy concert and I really hope the Margaritaville in Boston will be ready by August or maybe later than that  EDIT: I've been following your channel since the Rainforest Cafe video, your content is always so entertaining ^_^
greg
i thought i was gonna watch this while i eat my food but no, this is a cinematic event.
Ominous planet Hollywood sign at the end
This is NOT helping my nausea
Bros gotta stop in san antonio twice 😭
Best YouTube channel I swear always gets better.
Ain’t no way he did it TWICE 🔥‼️😩🗣💯
so when's the Dick's Last Resort video coming out?
This needs to be a yearly tradition slowly increasing the number of restaurants each year
Tag yourself I’m Ted drinking water at a place called Margaritaville
what about the Margaritavilles in the airports???
the way my jaw dropped when i saw this because no sane person subjects themselves to this madness TWICE
why do you keep doing this to yourself man
I’ve been on that same Ferris wheel in Tennessee and my father ripped ass when we were on it.
next year you have to do every bubba gump shrimp company resturant!
Is there not one in Jacksonville Beach FL? Or is that not a Margaritaville in the same way?
Thee BEEEEAAANNN
He's going to go insane again
as it turns out i have walked past Margaritavilles in at least 4 cities (some more than once) and have never been to a single one. is this a sign?
7:10 "think it might be tinnitus"
Pcb is great
so, where to next year?
Cheesecake Factory next year??
Um thank you i love it but please stop, your health > our entertainment
Wasted away on Eddy's misery again.... And it feels good
rip the times square margaritaville </3 they closed it :(
Definitely gonna hit 1 million +
Awww shit! Eddy is burBACK on the road!!
Planet Hollywood next !
Eddy your commitment to the bit is insane Amazing.
buddy next you gotta up the anti and do every Hard Rock Cafe in the world 🔥
"Fuck you Jimmy Buffett. You fucking suck" - Eric Cartman
I hadn't seen if Ted was on this trip, I was just like "You better bring Ted" and I actually yelled "YES" when you said "Ted and I"  Peak Content
commenting to boost bc i appreciate your effort 🫡
I FUCKING LOVE BUCCESS U SUCK
i love these videos. i know its unreasonable to expect you to keep making these considering how much time, energy and money they take. but a third one to round out the trilogy would be sweet. medieval times? bubba gump? hardrock cafe?
thank you for your courage
Where will Eddy and Ted eat next?? Every Chili’s in the U.S. and Canada???
JSCHLATT!
Next year is gonna be Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. calling it now
You missed the new one in Conroe, TX. Go back
Bubba Gump 2024?
........why would you spend thousands to rent a Tacoma?  What?!?!?!?!
Don’t you dare insult the cat in the hat ride it’s a bonafide classic
Gawd dayum that's a sexy stache
The sequel nobody knew we needed
Soooo... Are you doing planet Hollywood or bubba gump shrimp co next?
Who the hell is Deep Eddy? I’m subscribed to Eddy 9 Pins sir
Dollywood is a lot of fun you should go sometime
I think Tennessee is the best looking US state. As someone who lives in the flattest state, I get envious of their Smoky Mountains.
Now do Bubba Gumps
I have to imagine these places pipe in the margaritaville song multiple times a day. Can you imagine the mental damage you'd receive working there day in and day out?
Did I miss something? Or did Eddy skip over the Margaritaville Resort at the Lake of the Ozarks?
I’m early in the video so I’m pretty excited for you to find the gated community dedicated to Margaritaville near my house in Volusia county fl….
Gotta do Hard Rock Cafe next
he better do a eat at every medieval times in the country
Lucky ducky doesn’t have shit on cha-cha the tree frog or Tracy tree
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS AGAIN
He says it’s the final time but they are going to find another random weird restaurant chain to eat at 🫶fr love these vids
You son of a bitch. I'm in.
how much drunk driving was commited in this video?
Thank you for sacrificing your mind, body, and spirit for our collective entertainment.
Eddie why are you doing this to yourself?  Great content but seems to be pretty hard on you
bucc-ee touched my ass in nashville and I've never been the same. he's a creep.
Someone stop this man he is getting too powerful
Next year, Chicken Guy? Not a ton of Menu variety but there are tons of sauces so that could be good
Eddy, my boy, are you okay?
Next Eddy eats at every Chuck E Cheese in North America
This is the best nature documentary ever produced.
Dude I knew I saw you in New Orleans! That's insane
as a mississippian i just have to say that the o in biloxi makes the “uh” sound like in “of”😪
ATLANTA POG
My English composition teacher was named binkley
Eddy: I'd never listen to someone named BINKLEY what a goofy name hahaha  Eddy .2 seconds later: so we met up with my friend Schlatt
Now do this with Chili's!
youre my hero
The plane in Orlando was actually shot at once by the Jamaican government which inspired Jimmy to write the song “Jamaica Mistaica”
58:20 "was this a giant waste of time" Eddie you've saved restaurant industry, you a true legend who needs to be protected at all cost
48:15 fun fact: Anish Kapoor was the guy who made Cloudgate (aka The Bean). He is also a pretentious jerk. He has a line of paints that only he is legally allowed to use because of the way he patented/copyrighted/trademarked it or whatever.
The map pins look like Samus
Eddy, why do you keep doing this to yourself😭
somebody spent a lot of money on that museum and i love them for it
What an absolute dream of a road trip. Excellent video!! I was just passing the Margaritaville hotel in Jax Beach the other day and I thought to myself "now that's a happy place"
Eddy Bur-bucees
I wrkd concessions at a jimy buffet concert, it was hard selling 12$ land sharks to drunk and high boomers and  everyone was having so much fun, i clocked out and  drank my crate of tall beers by myself
Every McDonald's in America next ??!
oh my fucking god
It's really insane that i found Schlatt on this channel and then i was even more surprised when i found out he's a pretty big YouTuber
YEEES IM SO GLAD YOU WENT TO THE THING! Drove out there with my girlfriend and it's just so wacky and fun lol
really hope we have a companion video to this by ted just like the rainforest cafe one!
I recently rewatched your Rainforest Cafe video a few days ago, so when I saw the title of this video I just said “Oh no…” out loud.
0:30 no, I clicked on this video thinking "oh god, this shit again"
As a native from arizona I'm glad you stopped to visit "the things".
you should focus on wii bowling mr nine pins
Why would you ever choose to rent a TRUCK for a month long cross-country road trip. That tacoma probably gets 20 miles to the gallon😭
I felt bad for you the moment I saw the video length.
What about the one in the Detroit airport?
Hard Rock Cafe next
I love that this is a series now
Aw man what's Eddy gonna do next year, maybe Johnny Rockets? Famous Dave's? Ooh ooh, how about every single chuck E cheese and you spend the next 4 months on the road.
i love the vietnam PTSD at 12:30
you missed one in shreveport louisiana
So where are you going next year?
Can't wait for Bubba Gump Shrimp!
https://youtu.be/Bsb9T1g5nlE?t=1283 is that sarah mclachlan???
Eddie returns with another hour long video of how he tortures himself with solid food once more.
One day in Atlanta and you got the whole experience of local😂
I live in Shreveport, LA and I know you went to New Orleans but you missed a Margaritaville that is in Shreveport. BUT you touched La and even went through Bucs so it counts.
Just stumbled upon this video, and I must say   That’s one god damn moustache, it’s glorious
okay I was fully expecting to comment on some ~*wild and wacky*~ bit in this video but that moment at 34:47 was such an unexpectedly nice gesture of the manager/restaurant. I'm sure you guys treated them well as a result, but they did not have to do that
I stg if y’all were at pcb while i was there and I didn’t see y’all I would be livid
28:49 the fact that I've been to Disney world so often I immediately recognized you were in Epcot in this scene
There's only like 8 bennigans left....
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
Can't wait to see which restaurant chain you choose for next year! I'd recommend McDonalds. With over 13,500 locations in the US alone, you'd only need to hit 450 per day to finish within a month....but I did forget Canada...sooo
I love this. Make this a series
Hypothetically..... how much would it cost to get a margarita shirt delivered in time for my trip in Las Vegas in 29 hours?
those aliens got those DUMP TRUCKS
eddy.... why ?
Oh boy, I wonder what next year's trip will be!! My money is on Bubba Gump
I’m so glad you did a crazy road trip again
My mom loves Jimmy Buffett and I HAD to tell her about this video lol
I was not prepared for that pronunciation of Biloxi 😂
It was Jimmy, he orchestrated it! He hurted Eddy's tummy! And he gets to have a restaurant chain? What a sick joke!
BIL OX CEE??
I can't believe Eddy came once again to my shitty Florida state and I missed him. Again.  This is not a cheeseburger in paradise.
"second and final time"? Yeah right Eddy 'Ninepins'
eddy what is wrong with you
JUST when i thought there was no more content... that YouTube was finally done for good... Eddy Burback uploads an hour long video on his main channel. We are eating.
I thought there used to be a margaritaville in Palm Springs CA?
Can't wait for next year when they visit every planet Hollywood in america and Canada
You missed the one at Lake Conroe, Tx.
spent most of the video vibrating with excitement over your reaction to the syracuse margaritaville and by extension destiny mall... was NOT disappointed
Here we go again 💀
My friends and I tried to eat at the Atlanta Margaritaville after a concert once and we got there as the kitchen closed so the waiter gave us free water as an apology
37:27  That is thee most accurate statement I've ever heard considering thats where my Midwestern family went
that was amazing
i cannot believe eddy was in biloxi mississippi
Anyone else get the feeling that Ted and Eddie arent vibing right now???
SYRACUSE NEW YORK MENTION BABY LETS GO I hate that Margaritaville it gave me a tummy ache
poor eddie ;~;
You skipped the Margaritaville resort in Nashville!!!!!! 😮😮😮
Are the Guy Fieri restaurants next?
Eddy goes insane again but in a different way
What's the final song at the end the piano song not the part where you're home having a crisis
Can't wait until next year when you eat at every Hard Rock
46:32 MISNEY MAKES THEM PAY!!
The sequel we didn’t know we needed
THE LONG AWAITED SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi eddy
Why did you do this to yourself again
Now you need to go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant.
Eddy, buddy, nobody said you needed to do this again… That being said We are all very happy you’re doing this again
next year every Bubba Gump restaurants in the US (there's only 22)
omg my dad loves this restaurant tbis is so funny
the mall of america is the worst place to eat any food, let alone gimmick chain restaurants
this is so ironic bc i’m watching this as i’m getting ready to go to margaritaville with my family
just finishing the florida segment, and i feel as a certified florida man i must state my thoughts:  1. even though i’m a (casual) buffett fan and regularly go to margaritaville/stay at the resort, i would not wish this trip upon anyone. no clue how you guys survived this one but i salute you  2. i know exactly how terrifying the cat in the hat ride is. it’s like a drug trip for babies. i have filmed multiple videos of me screaming on that ride. i have also filmed multiple videos of me sitting in the dark on it because the ride broke. terrifying 0/10 would not recommend  3. the orlando margaritaville resort used to be a lot smaller LMAO i stayed there while they were doing construction and during that visit we were awoken at a crisp 7:30 with the sound of very loud construction. every morning. the restaurant in the resort is phenomenal though so it was a 10/10 stay  4. really glad you enjoyed the beaches! they’re definitely the best part of the state for sure, no matter what area you go to. wish more people would spend less time at theme parks and spend more time admiring the natural scenery here (including my family).   5 (last point i promise). COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE RAIN HATE i still freak out and refuse to drive in the rain LMAO the only good part about it is that most of the time it only lasts for a few minutes before the weather goes back to acting like nothing happened like tf you mean??  anyways, small comment essay aside, i am completely impressed you guys survived this because god knows i wouldn’t  (also you are correct. the key west one is AWESOME as long as you ignore the iguanas and roosters)
lol why do you continue to put yourself through this torture!!!!!
This video legit deserves 1b views
I hate to say this, but I think you missed one in Osage Beach, MO 😂
28:01 didnt know people walked backwards in florida!
eddy ballsback
Next, EVERY MCDONALDS
Babe wake up! The best video of 2023 just dropped!
I hope this is a yearly road trip adventure of these two for years to come
I like the constant peaceful nature that each Margaritaville location brings Eddy and whenever he runs into Rainforest Cafe he's reminded of the horror
U should go to every McDonald's in the world
edyy why
Wow drove through my town and didn’t say hi? Okay.
Eddy what the fuck
next time, go to every singel MacDonals in the entire USA, including Alaska and Hawaii, yes all 13,513 off them (af off July 04, 2023). (evil lauth) 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Tight race between this and spiderverse for best sequel of the year!
margaritaville cruise ship review when
This madlad, nothing can stop him
This is quite literally the sequel to end all other sequels. Good job eddy. You did it
The only reasonable thing you can do now is triple down so you don't look foolish. You must keep going, Eddy.
I hope Eddy gets sponsored by like audible or something so he can  listen to books and stuff while on the road and make money too.
The sequel we didn't know we needed
This is the first time I've heard of this restaurant
It’s been a YEAR since the rainforest cafe video⁉️⁉️ wtf is happening 😭
Teds a city person and Eddy isn’t lmfao
i had a panic attack in the orlando margaritaville 😊
The sequel no one asked for but that everyone needed.
22:00 oh no...hes becoming a parrothead
come over
Next year is every McDonald’s in America
I think Eddie just wants to go on Vacation but he wants to work so he makes it a video
Do every Applebees in the country next.
Everybody loves a sequel
Eddy, my sister and I, who were raised on buffet songs, had been joking about doing this since the rfc video last year. Thanks for stealing our idea. Oh, and welcome to the buffet cult. No, theres no way out. Enjoy your cheeseburger in paradise
HE DID IT AGAIN
every planet hollywood lies in wait for you and ted
Eddy. Why.
You never get the same thing! Have you not seen Airplane!
I'm not even a 3rd of the way through this video, but I've decided Ted's graceful chair sitting is the best part of the whole thing. 12:02
VISIT EVERY WAFFLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY NEXT OR WE RIOT
Can’t wait for next year when the trilogy is completed
I saw this and fully out loud gasped . the mad man did it again
an hour long burback special????? YIPPEEE
You should go to every McDonald’s or subway next
"second and final trip" Yeah okay, see you next year for the Bubba Gump Shrimp road trip haha
eddy you are gods bravest soldier
LETS GO ANOTHER EPIC BURBACK VIDEO BEST WAY TO START THE DAY
Ted seemed so pissed
I know no one cares but when you did the last one I kept hoping you would do Margaritaville and then you did.   So I am going to take credit for this.
You get Justin McElroy in on this?
Next year better be every Hard Rock in the world
Does this mean next year it’s gonna be the Hard Rock Cafes turn next summer
I have a very vivid memory of going to the Myrtle Beach Margaritaville as a four year old and the hurricane scared me
Watching Eddie go into another deep spiral is so entertaining
God's strongest warrior survived Margaritaville with a tummy ache
first thing I thought when this notif popped up - "but why?" OH BOY AM I GLAD I FOUND OUT. This is GOLD.
You know what you need to do now,  EVERY HARD ROCK CAFE!
i hope in the future we have museums about the internets history and we see a lot of memes and wojack
Can’t wait for Ted’s perspective where he witnesses Eddy’s descent into Jimmy Buffett induced madness with abject horror
If these boys aren't using piss bottles they are crazy!
the scary thing about getting lost in buccees is there’s no service bc there’s too many people
Well now we need a part three of resurants need a trilogy
You’re insane
does he ever say that he is "wasting away again, in Margaritaville"  edit: woohoooo I love you Eddy Burback you boatful man of mystery 52:53
you missed shreveport/bossier! worth skipping though. ppace is a.... meff den
Hard Rock Cafes next year?
You missed the margaritaville hotel in Palm Springs
another banger. i have never been to a margaritaville, but now i feel like i have. jimmy buffet is family now
Eddie Burback and Ted nivison are masters of doing things that nobody asked for
Literally last night I was thinking it was about time for a new video.
I clicked on this Video because it popped up on my YT-Startpage and cause i really enjoyed you Jungle Café Video and the one about Ghost Kitchens. Seems to be time for a Subbie ^^  Recently some Content-Creators founded their own delivery Service on the concept of ghost kitchens, that i wanted to try. Today was the third time i tried to order from them and straight up just couldn't because of the Kitchen, closest to my Place -_______-
Literally love buccees idc what anyone says , I used to live in Georgia and in my area that was the only fun thing to do 😭
Do every burger king next
Do Bubba Gumps next!
16:07 that was actually a Diplo set. Justin made a special appearance and sang songs they both made with skrillex during the Jack U days.
Eddie what the fuck lmao 😂😂😂
It's so cool watching the Pigeon Forge part because I've been many times as I only live about an hour away. It'd be very cool for you to come back and do a Dollywood trip!
This makes me wanna go on a road trip
Can’t wait for eddy’s 2024 video, “I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in the country”
I can’t wait for “I ate at every Arby’s in the country”
SIR--
How nice of Ted and Eddy to take Drew to Margaritaville twice
This video distracted me so much that I didn’t realise that I got the wrong bus.
i can’t express how happy i am that he did this with ted.
YESSSSSSSSS another one !!
Take it international next year: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEjnxaSWAAA1YMG?format=jpg
as a binkley, you shouldnt listen to me
Next year you need to one up this again with a hard rock cafe trip
wwjd
This really is just a copy and paste of the rainforest cafe video with the name of the restaurant swapped out.
This has to be the Shrek 2 of Eddy's "I ate at every X in the Country" series, it's completely better than the first installment
Nice. Now eat at every McDonald's. Godspeed, Eddy. 🙏
I'd just like to say... I paused the screen at EXACTLY 34:00 and walked away, and when I came back I was absolutely horrified.   How is that so perfectly terribly oh my god I'm at a co-working space and people can see my screen
i literally just rewatched the Rainforest Cafe video last night, the last thought in my mind was "oh boy i can't wait for the sequel"
This is interesting seeing both of these videos having never been to Rainforest Cafe or Margaritaville.
Can't wait to find out that Ted was freebasing rainforest cafe at every stop to stay sane
Eddy...babygirl...why are you doing this to yourself
BUC-EES MENTIONED
If I had a nickel...
Hard Rock Cafe next??
As an Mississippian they way Eddy said Biloxi hurt
I love you I watched the rainforest cafe 20 times
The Syracuse one seems to be a direct reflection of the area (coming from a local)
Wait. You mentioned the one in Tulsa . . . but didn't go there. So . . .
Ain't no way my boy said "Bilauxee" 😭😭
This guy’s decent Into madness it written better than most show’s I’ve watched recently
Lol the into was pure gold! Good stuff man.
"how do celebrities keep up this party lifestyle?" cocaine, it's cocaine
Can't wait for Eddy to go to every Mcdonalds next year.
Eddie, are you hypnotized by jimmy buffet?
No one asked for this and yet hes going all in.  Eddie 8 Pins strikes again
Ted wearing a shirt of the THING? Like 20 minutes after that but made me laugh really hard lol
Are there resorts without restaurants? I was waiting for him to go to the one near me in north Houston (lake Conroe). Surely he didn’t miss one……
But what about the Margaritaville off of Lake Conroe in TX? :(
The straight to dvd sequel
What a masterpiece.
I go to that mall in Syracuse all the time, and I forgot that there was a Margaritaville in it for the longest time. And yup, this video shows it exactly how I remember it
47:11 best clip of all time
Eddy came to truly understand and channel his inner Jimmy Buffett in this journey. Unfortunately, he channeled "My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink, and I Don't Love Jesus" off of his 1976 album Havana Daydreamin'.
Crazy to assume this is profitable
im starvin
I had a dream I was at the thing museum. Good to know that I was full on astral projecting
You son of a bitch you did it again
I was so inspired by this video that I ate lunch even though my tummy hurts
You should go to every Bubba Gumps next
Videos like this are masterpieces man!
Hell yeah. Just like the Rainforest Cafe video, I can watch this monthly and not get sick of it.
LEGEND
As a mississippian it's pronounced bil-uck-zi lol
See ya next year, Dave & Busters!
Fun fact about the Syracuse location, it’s currently embroiled in a huge lawsuit with the mall because they haven’t paid their rent in like 4 years, it’s millions of dollars. How it’s still open is insane   But also, I’m sorry you had to come to Syracuse.
Eddy Burback 2024: "I ate at every Buc-ee's in the Country"
The “Bil-lock-see” instead of “Bil-luck-see” is a mad man’s delusion
America... isn't right...
wow
There used to be a restaurant called Cheeseburgers in Paradise in my hometown. But Jimmy sued the pants off of the owner. Now it’s called Beef N Buns in Paradise. Which would be an infinitely better song.
When i clicked on this video i thought man they're gonna love the one at Destiny! that margaritaville has been miserable for years!
Please tell me you are not going on the cruise too.
I live near the Destiny Mall location and it is bad and very expensive. This chain only makes sense if it’s located on the water, not on the 3rd floor of a mall 😅
do every mcdonalds next 🔥
The sequel we never knew we wanted!
Bubba gump shrimp factory is next
Its always a good day when you have an eddie video to watch
So I thought this was going to be Rainforest Café 2: Electric Boogaloo, but as the video progressed, it seems more like a revenge trip on Ted.
This video means a lot to me. I was the originally cheeseburger in paradise fan girl. My parents took me to the restaurant and I went decked out in my own handmade (I drew on it with sharpies) t-shirt. Thank you for this.
No you did not! Did you not learn anything from before?
Its disappointing to see you taking ad money from sofi. They're keeping hundreds of thousands of Americans under crushing loan debt. There's no income driven repayment. There's no forgiveness. Right now I have to pay sofi $1350 every month until at LEAST 2030. Thats where your ad money is coming from. Its coming from us. Do better.
What possessed you to do this again
Already looking forward to next year’s “I ate at every Bubba Gump Shrimp in the Country” video.
JURY DUTY
He did it again, nobody told him to but he did it AGAIN. Nothing but respect for you, also a bit of lust
i was at the chicago one june 10th :O
Never clicked on a video so fast
this is my super bowl
I’m only 4 minutes in but if this doesn’t end with Eddy becoming a Jimmy Buffet  cultist, imma be so disappointed
30:23 as a 9 year old, me and my friend were inside the cat in the hat ride when it started storming outside. we went through at least 5 consecutive rides to the point that we didn’t have to wait because we were literally the only ones who stayed long enough and didn't just run out into the rain. i still think about it
Now you have to go to every springfield in the country
Eddy needs to go to every Medieval Times restaurant next year
17:05 this is the funniest visual to me, knowing that there's a four year old trying to beat a man vlogging at an arcade game, and Eddy still just beats him because he knows it'll take to long to let the kid win
NOT AGAIN
Please do this trip one more time with another fading restaurant chain so we can have a nice trilogy.
cleveland has a margaritaville?? i've lived here my whole life and never heard of it. also: THANK YOU for including Tim Misny's Billboard 😁
Next year's tour of every Cheesecake Factory gonna be crazy.
I am betting 5 whole nickels that next year is Gump restaurants
bro looks like ed kemper
I loved these road trip vids wish you did more
Day 9 and he's already had a spiritual revolution, I can't wait for the other stages of grief
34:20 Yeah welcome to Atlanta. The moment you said there was one up here, I'm like "okay 75 or 20 is gonna be a damn nightmare."
Every McDonald's in America?
You missed the margaritaville at lake lanier 😡
AGAIN?! EDDIE WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?
48:23 Weezer
You really did live your life in margaritaville.
As a professional truck driver, I thank you for not calling Buc-ee's a truck stop
You know nobody is making you do this?? You can walk away. It’s okay to say no ❤
The "final" time. Yeah ok. Sureeee
Our struggles in life are what define us as human
accidentally manifested this video cause i fell asleep watching the rainforest cafe video last night 😭
Why would you do this to yourself again
Ok man, love your videos but you're killing me, with the way you are saying Biloxi.
oh yay now i don't have to go to the one in my hometown myself
yo props to that 4 yo kid playin stinky feet
i saw the video thumbnail and all i could think was NO EDDY NOT AGAIN
Burback: The hero we need, but we don't deserve
"Some people claim that there's a woman to blame...  But we know it's (only Eddies crazy ideas') fault."
I didn’t think this video was going to be more than 30 minutes for some reason but I’m here for it
Mall of America is awesome
Medieval Times next year???
Respect man. Margaritaville is hilariously mid so I know exactly how taxing that journey must have been
Schlatt... have friend?
Ha ha ha, nice video. Now do Bubba Gump's. Do it. Just do it Ed.😠
I like how this one is Eddy enjoying...which means Ted's version will have him go into insanity
just wanna point out how bad traffic is here in atlanta. it was so bad it almost ruined y'alls schedule. I'm apologizing for Georgia rn. 🤣
Eddy next you should visit every Hard Rock Cafe in North America
They’ve done it again
A herculean undertaking once again, well done boys.
Technically, the guy's name is "T. Binkley," so clearly whatever the T stands for is more embarrassing than "Binkley."
Crazy I just talked to a friend about the Rainforest Cafe episode and learned he watched Ted's video.
well now I'm just worried about you.  EDIT:  I totally get it. PROTECT THOSE FEET.
So wait is Jimmy Buffett an alien? Is he The Thing?
Doe's eat place at the biloxi margaritaville is good but it's not a real Doe's. The real Doe's only serves fancy steaks, french fries, and hot tamales and theyre all LIT
the fact that the internet has gotten to a point where you have to censor your feet  in vids/photos is wild
This is fucking amazing content
Wow I think we've reached a new level of uselessness for YT videos. I'll up the ante by reviewing every Applebee's in the western hemisphere.
BY GOD HES DONE IT AGAIN
Hear me out though... next year you and Ted complete the trilogy and go to all 23 bubba gump shrimp restaurants in the US. It will be a cinematic trilogy unlike the world has ever seen.
I can’t wait for the third installment where he does this with Bubba Gump
eddy babe, it's pronounced ba-luck-see 😅 but you aren't the first visitor to get it wrong.
Why a flat bed truck on a road trip?
Wait, this is hilarious.
Fool me once, shame on you  Fool me twice, shame on me Is this whole video
What a man
Im from Safford, AZ (about an hour from The Thing) and I don't know ANYONE who has actually gone in the "museum". I dont even stop there for drinks and snacks because everything is overpriced
DOLLYWOOD NEXT PLEASEE
This was a great shirt commercial!
This is so cool, Eddy! You should go to every McDonald's next!!
“I’d like to live all my life in margaritaville, nobody can harsh the vibe in margaritaville”
I can’t believe this is happening 🤣
Now go to every chuck-e-cheese
Damn, both me and eddy are hot for that alien CAKE🥵🥵🥵🥵
24 days to visit every margaritaville without the use of any exploits? That’s hardly an optimal run. Expected better from you Eddy.
Are you ok? Why do this again? What's next every McDonald's in the country
Bro basically went on a 24 day bender
You should go to every McDonalds in America next
Lmao Jesus Christ this guy is a masochist but like only to cheesy corporations
A journey to eat a cheeseburger in every paradise- and they’re all gone. None of them exist anymore
Im sooo hoping the roles get reversed when Ted uploads
The rainforest café video was my favorite video of last year, so can't wait for this journey, will update once i'm done watching
Why would you do something like this again? Rainforest Cafe nearly killed you last time, have you learned nothing?
Ngl the Long Weekend in the blender cup goes crazy
Next eat at every McDonald’s in the country
Weirdly apt that I should go to Margaritaville Myrtle Beach last week.
Where can we pay for the uncensored version?
I love how you and Ted’s moods are always flipped lol. Levels out the vibe
Ladies and gentlemen, he's done smashed it again
You've made Jimmy proud, Eddy. Good work.
omg i stayed at that hotel in key west mf relatable
he's back, baby
good video
Can't wait till they go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp next year
So, every Hard Rock Cafe in the US and Canada next year?
He's just a Cheeseburger in Paradise
This feels like when you open Netflix and find out that your comfort show just dropped a new season you didn’t know was coming and I am here for it
YOU MISSED THE ONE IN SANDUSKY OHIO
Babe can't talk, new video of a man going clinically insane for my pleasure just dropped
I can't wait until 20 years from now and the culmination of this series sees Eddy eating at every Burger King in the country.
i saw this thumbnail and said "no you didnt" i just fully didnt believe youd do this again clearly i am a fool
Every BUC-EE’s in the country coming next summer to a theater near you.
Thank you for the Cleveland representation. Mr. Misney will make them pay.
I think I'm having déjà vu
There’s one of these near my mall😭
Do a tour of the Hard Rock Cafe next. 😂
I love going on the Dr. Seus ride and screaming
I was SO confused hearing that the famous BILLIONAIRE investor is also a tropical country singer and founder of the Margaritaville empire… Today I learned Jimmy Buffett and Warren Buffett are two different people 😅
I really thought he already did this and then I remembered Rainforest 😂
Again, man?
The rainforest cafe video was the first I ever saw of Eddy, great to see the insanity once again!
You missed the Margaritaville at the Miami airport.
So when are going to every Bubba Gump's in the US?
As someone who goes to the Destiny USA Mall often I can say that  Margaritaville there is bad. It’s way to open and I have never seen the margarita blender work.
Medieval Times 2024?
I literally just watched the rainforest cafe video yesterday for the first time
You should do Cheesecake Factory next
Yayyyyyy the saga continues!!!
As someone with the honor of living really close to a margaritaville, ours is really desolate and empty and they’re probably going to close it. So it’s great that you were able to get there in time and experience the joy
" oh shit!! Coolest motherfuckers on the planet!" I dunno who that man is, but i want him around all the time to hype me up.
49.50 okay what the actual hecking heck is going on here. did y'all both put mascara on, get a lash lift?!?!?!? why don't my eyelashes look this good 😢
Edd giving himself PTSD just for funsies
Alternate Title: How Eddy Found Religion
i cant believe i was like 2 days late to meeting eddy burback at Margaritaville
The chain saga continues
A better title would have been “man goes places and does things”
I live like 5 minutes away from Margaritaville in Hollywood, Florida! I grew up on that Broadwalk! So cool to see you over there!
Its so nice he had someone dress up as Schlatt to honor his memory. He would have wanted to be there. Rest in peace 😞
The Supersize Me sequel no one wanted or asked for.
Eddy I dare you to do this with every Cracker Barrel location in the US
lots of reminders of justin bieber….in a jimmy buffet themed restaurant…justin bieber = JB…jimmy buffet = JB….coincidence? i don’t think so
Thats so funny I clicked to see if there was a secret ne in boston that i just never heard of cuz I wanna go to one sooo bad...and not even like 3 mins in and.... "..one in development in Boston..."   Never been so disappointed and so happy before
As a Clevelander, I can only imagine the absolute bewilderment at the Tim Misny billboards with just his eyes on them LOL just remember, "He makes them pay!"
Next year: I ate at every McDonald's in America
Forgot the one in Missouri
YALL GOTTA DO HARDROCK CAFE NEXT !!!!!
Pls do McDonald’s next.
10:22  Slatt? Bros been pushing p since birth
So are you going to the one in Boston when it opens?
Why did you not go to the Bossier City Margaritaville?
JIMMY BUFFETT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like Ted pov is gonna be hell
The hero we didn't know we needed.
Cracker Barrel next. We believe in you Eddy
Unfortunately you didn’t going to every Margaritaville resort, which would mean you would have to go to Medford, Oregon. A place which desperately lacks the vibe of tropical bliss.
Everything he said about Dollywood isn't wrong lol
this is so profoundly beautiful. bravo eddy
So when’s the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. video coming?
I had a feeling y'all were doing another one of these when I saw y'all on Bourbon Street. New Orleans used to have a Margaritaville, but it closed down.
Absolute tears when you locked eyes on the rainforest cafe 😂
Okay, you're dropping this the same week as Barbie and Hoppenhimer??? I was planning a double feature but now a TRIPLE FEATURE??? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I get Eddy and Schlatt confused constantly, it’s good to know that they are separate people
Do Chuck E. Cheese’s next  (I’m joking it’s not even worth going because most of not all locations don’t have their animatronics anymore)
Ted had a real ashwagandha experience
excited to see you do all of the Bubba Gump Shrimps next year!
where do you get the 4k uncensored version?
Aliens v.s. Dinosaurs would make a great movie universe.
How much you wanna bet he’s gonna go to every McDonald’s in North America in like 15 years also I’m from Florida and that rain is pretty bad (but at least it’s not like everyone else in my area that freaks out when it’s sprinkling (& have been to the ones in Hollywood beach & universal)
I went to a margaritaville in destin lol. It was actually insane
The rainforest cafe video has been my comfort video since the upload, I'm so happy to have a new addition
Eddy... please stop We're all worried about you
"For the second and final time, we hit the road again"  You still have to go to every Bubba Gump Shrimp OR Hard Rock Cafe in the United States, perhaps that should be next year's road trip
I never thought this would become a series but I’m so glad it did
The one in Honolulu is hot garbage haha
when me and my friends went to the mall of America last year on a band trip,  we took a group picture in front of the Margaritaville sign because we thought it would be funny if minors posed infront of something with the word margarita
This was great. Also, this entire time I had been reading Ted’s YouTube name as “Ted Nivision”, like a movie that you “can now see in tednivision!” and didn’t realize the mistake until you said it out loud. He should probably change it to TedNivision; it sounds very cool.
what chain is next????
Margaritaville in Times Square is my favorite place on the planet
did not previously know this was a restaurant, let alone a chain. thanks for shedding some light on this eddy boy
You guys should do tiki bars. You could just start with The ones in Southern California and then work your way up. ❤️
Umm I need a Skinny Margaritaville
I need to know what the T in T. Binkley Prince is
Hard Rock Cafe video when?
The sequel we never knew we deserved
in my  middle of no where town in indiana we had a resturant called "Cheese burger in paradise" which was basically Magaritaville but more Cheeseburger centered. sadly it shut down but i loved that place as a kid
Was Animal cafe really q year ago? Damn time passes
Waiting for Ted's perspective now.
i live in the keys and that drive is so comforting to go to miami and back it’s rly nice
Everyone knows margaritas are the perfect beverage to wash down all those safari fries.
I went to the Margaritaville in Cleveland for a friend’s 21st. I didn’t know they were owned by Jimmy Buffet until half way through our time there.
That random hype man in Chicago is so fuckin adorable omg
the aliens v dinos is almost the plot of the dragon song war
EDDYYYYYYYYY
Wow. The Thing? has had a MAJOR overhaul since I went 12 years ago. It used to just be a quirky run down museum of things that the owners claimed had some sort of tie to historical events or people. Every southern AZ native knows about it, and has spent countless road trips begging their parents to stop, only to be told no. Supposedly, they used to have actual mummified remains, but they got removed for some vague legal reasons that change depending on who is telling the story. Not sure if it really ever did.
From one Eddie to another my man you are legendary.
It makes me happy that the Atlanta people were nice. I live like 5 mins from there and I'm used to hearing not so great things about it here
I used to work at the Margaritaville in Biloxi. There have been many drownings and deaths and weird accidents there(allegedly) that never make the news cycle. Very weird vibes. Most of my customers were employees, as well.
I was just re-binging the rainforest videos yesterday! Perfect timing
eddie was in cleveland and I didnt even know 😢
Eddy you DID NOT! Do you know how many times I’ve rewatched your rainforest cafe documentary? Your forcing me into watching this one at least twice as many times and I love it
that Green M&M bit killed me...😂💚
Just saw this on my feed and my first reaction:  EDDY WHY
THE SAGA CONTINUES !!!!
somehow I can see 20 years from now eddy posting a video 20 years in the making, eating at every McDonalds location in the US and canada.
Wait didn’t you miss one? There’s one in Conroe/Montgomery TX
Eddy "Coolest Motha Fuckas on the Planet" Burback
I went to the Destin and Panama City Beach Margaritavilles. They are really gorgeous. I really like the beaches
The sequel I never would've expected. I saw the title and just thought "Eddy, why." Anyways, thanks for sharing the Buffet gospel.
OHHHH GOD NOT AGAIN EDDIE IS GONNA BE OVER IT AFTER ABOUT A WEEK LOL
I’m actually so excited to see how Teds video contrast Eddys tone wise…
I’m absolutely screaming at you meeting the same fan twice, what a weird twist of fate
bean shoutout i love chicao
Had a feeling you were dojng a big project like rainforest cafe cause of the length of time since your last vid lmao
how is jimmy buffet's restaurant not a jimmy buffet buffet
So many memories I have at the Myrtle Beach Margaritaville, and none of them good lmao
EDDY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. (next time you done of these do not do mc donalds)
I don't want to know anyone who sees "The Thing" signs and doesn't pull over.
DAMN THIS VIDEO IS ALMOST AN HOUR LONG 😭😭
you are so beautiful in this video i just wanna say
He should have used Vivaldi Summer instead of winter. Like come on it's the 4 seasons and he chose the wrong one. The suspense that it has corresponds with his declining mental state!!!
AGAIN?
I’m so happy you did this again lol
the roles are recersed
As someone very familiar with the Syracuse Margaritaville, I can attest that it is the most tropical location by far
is this your brand now eddy?
i literally only know what Margaritaville is because of Jury Duty
Im literally going to the Margaritaville Resort in South Padre TX next week. Great timing Eddy thank you for the educational video 👍
This absolute unit did it twice. He’s not the mustache we deserve, but he’s the mustache we need
YESSSSSSS
So Hard Rock next?
I was planning on finally stopping to see the thing for my last drive out to college in Arizona but now I don’t have to I guess
i think you should do burger king next year
He needs to eat at the singular sweet tomatoes (or souplantation if you’re a weirdo) in Arizona that’s gonna open up soon.  That shit was my childhood but then covid shut all em down.
The SEQUEL
The sequel we didn't know we needed
WE'RE BACK BABY
yesssssssssssss! this HAS to be a yearly thing!
BUT IT ISN'T CHRISTMAS YET
Haha I love that he got the Tim Misney billboard in Cleveland
He didn't go to the one on Isla Nublar!
The mad lad did it again
this video is oddly feet-centric
Hi, I’m Jimmy.
Another banger vid from ole' Eddy Ninepins!!
This is my On the Road
This is genuinely a great series, and I would be ok with this being an annual thing.
Do Hard Rock Cafe next
This video is false, you skipped a Margaritaville in Texas, specifically the lake resort one.  Jokes aside man I wished you came to mine, I'm a production coordinator,you could've had a whole ass show
Is he going to do this every year?
You better make Braden appear in your inevitable 3rd series: Going to every MC Donalds in North America
please eat at every burger king next :D
Holy shit, again. We are doing it AGAIN
MY GOD HE'S DONE IT AGAIN
Dang it eddy You missed the margaritaville in Jacksonville Florida
*buh·luhk·see* Biloxy, MS
Im so upset by how you pronounced Biloxi
Last week I re-watched your personal hell of visiting rainforest Cafe for the 3rd time. I can not wait until I get home from work to watch this new video.
so is hard rock cafe next
What is wrong with you
I feel so vindicated that he exposed the Cat in the Hat Ride. It's horrifying! And the cat looks like he's wearing someone else's skin lol
The sequel of a lifetime…  My children’s children will remember this day
Can we all send some prayers out for jimmy buffett to live another 10-20
I lose my boyfriend every time we step into a bucees and I can confirm that the panic is real
The sequel of a lifetime…  My children’s children will remember this day
This is the greatest video series ever made
"The day you had self reflection was the day you had diarrhea."  -Eddy
YESSSSSS THANK YOU FOR FEEDING US GOOD
This video is just a record of Eddy dealing with PTSD through alcoholism.
God I'd do anything to have the money for a 24 day roadtrip across the country without a care in the world with my loved ones.
39:46 you look like the 5th Weezer back from vacation
I can't even begin to imagine the mental drain that these videos cause you, but I love 'em
I love Eddie making fun of someone’s name and then immediately introducing a friend named “schlatt”
The Hollywood beach is the location I go to every year when I visit my family. Love it!
AGAIN?!?!?!!??!!?!?!!?!!? He is back to torturing his mind and body for our entertainment.
Being a gay dumbass with a weird fixation on Jimmy Buffett and a huge crush on Eddy Burback has finally paid off.
I work at the Universal CityWalk Margaritaville and Jimmy Buffett has now merged with my soul
this is straight up a horror movie
My instant reaction to seeing this in my feed: NO. HE DIDNT. *Immediately click*
love these thanks eddy!!!
Eddy you absolute mad lad for doing this all again! Love it
Oh this is gonna be fun 🤣 why would you do this to yourself again lmfaoooo
Eddie why?
Ted is an enigma.
Next year are you eating at every Bubba Gump Shrimp?
I love that it seems like Ted and Eddy have very different progressions of insanity. Ted, as he descends further into madness, goes into denial and embraces the chaos with joy. Whereas Eddy's outlook just becomes more and more bleak.
Atlanta hospitality :) I'm glad they were nice
It is so funny to me that Eddy has never learned a thing about Parrotheads
Why did you not go to the Jacksonville FL Margaritaville ?
Yes.
Let’s fucking gooooo!
We doing this again
imaging those old orlandeans seeing you film yourself walking down their street waving at no one
I can't wait to see Ted's side of the story.
We're so back
Saw the thumbnail and out loud was like “Eddy, Nooooooooooo”
Once is an occurrence. Twice is a pattern. I hope you know you’ll be doing this once a year from now on.
I guess next year it'll be every Hard Rock Cafe in the country huh?
I JUST SAW THE THUMBNAIL- EDDY NO! NO! YOU SAID IT WAS DONE!!!!
Is it just me or does anyone else love these YouTuber road trip videos where they visit a bunch of different places? It would be fun to just watch eddy and ted go on a big road trip even without having to go to low quality copy and paste chain restaurants lol
The only one I’ve been to was the one in Myrtle Beach. (I’m from South Carolina.) Funny story, actually. We ate there for dinner. (The bottle thing was broken.)  Then, we left to find something for dessert. Everything was closed except Insomnia Cookies, which at the time there was only one person working, and everything cookie burning. So, we ended up going back to Margaritaville for dessert.
My grandmother (who is on the larger side) fell down the handicapped ramp in a margaritaville.
maybe the real treasure is the paradise we found along the way
watching these videos (as a europen) i once again realize that america is just not a real place. Like i simply refuse to belive it... Australia being made up? Nah, America is way more unlikely than a bunch of animals that kill everything on sight
mcdonals next
now do mcdonalds.
The sequel we didn't know we wanted, but the one that we needed
Why not eat at every Mc donalds? (this is a joke you will die there are 13,513 of them holy shit)
That's just Atl traffic bro I hate it
this is just a 1hr commercial for margaritaville isnt it
"second and final time" yeah yeah eddy, we all know next year you'll do all the hard rock cafes
eddy
Go for all of the chilis in the U.S. and Canada next year
Every time Eddie uploads I giggle and kick my feet
Why do you do this to yourself? Anyways love your content keep up the good work😊
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
babe new Eddie Burback video
Haven’t watched it yet, the mere existence of this video just made my day
The way he said Biloxi hurt me so bad.
And so the voyage begins again
This is true dedication. Try something even crazier next time. Maybe visit every McDonalds in the world?
Do the McElroys know about this video yet
The sequel I didn't know I needed
Schlumm
why did i watch this i literally dont care
You're a true patriot.
Taking a trip across the country (and Canada) to eat at every location of a chain restaurant just isn't the same without the Rainforest Cafe monkeys. Thank you Eddy
Can’t wait for the next road trip to all Hard Rock Cafes in the US
be sure to talk with your gf about having kids and keep it in written form
So glad we don’t have to worry about you guys falling through the football-basketball sized hole in the passenger side of Ted’s car throughout this video 6:35
Should have dun a bang bang at the mall of America.....
A third one needs to be done where Eddy eats at every Casa Bonita
Bubba gumps when?
What about the margaritaville in Medford Oregon?
This video seems like it might be the antithesis of the rainforest cafe video; so I cant wait to see if it is Ted who falls to Margrita Madness and Eddie who ascends to cheeseburger paradise. Alternatively, they might both just get icky tumny aches ow ouch oof ouchy
My friend wanted his birthday party at a Rainforest Cafe this year (we're a friend group ranging in our 20s), so we drove 8 hours total for the occasion. It was both really fun and extremely overstimulating. Thought about you, soldier. 💜🦍  Next year, it's Margaretaville...
Here’s to hoping for every Medieval Times next year!
He’s at it again 😂
Haha The Thing signs reminded me of when I kept seeing Wall Drug signs while driving to Wyoming. Slogans like, "Have you dug Wall Drug?" And "What the heck is Wall Drug?" Kept popping up every mile or so. I had no choice but to go find Wall Drug
“Oh shit coolest motherfuckers on the planet” killed me
My God, the crazy son of a bitch did it again.
They have more than 1 margaritaville?
Hard Rock Cafe next pls
A second niche themed restaurant road trip video has hit YouTube
…Now do Applebees
Now do applebees
Eddie i hope you know that i saw ur rainforest cafe video right before i went on vacation in michigan and i made my family drive 3 hours out of the way just to go to the auburn hills rainforest cafe near detroit 😭 and i have zero regrets
next up hitting every mcdonald’s in the us
Wow, what a great video. I can’t wait for the third one
THE RETURN OF THE KING 👑🍸
Next year go to every olive garden
eddy are you okay eddy? are you being forced to do this eddy? eddy we're all worried about you
So is this going to be an annual roadtrip thing between you and Ted now? Please say it is. 😂
Where rainforest cafe falls, margaritaville rises
thank you Eddi
I'm so glad you decided to torture yourself yet again and choose another staple of my younge experience. I'm also really happy you enjoyed the FL beaches, as a born and raised Floridian it's probably our best feature lol (I've missed the beautiful sunsets since I moved out of the state so that was a nice treat, ty)    I don't remember if you mentioned it so maybe it's gone but at the Orlando Universal restaurant there was a HUGE blender at the bar that would make hurricane noises and spin like a blender lmao.
whatchu mean rainforest cafe was a whole year ago??
At least he's not doing McDonalds or Subway.
We are once again witnessing a generational journalistic feat
40:50 it would be so funny if Ted's video comes out and he and Eddy swapped personalities (thanks Jimmy) from the Rainforest Cafe videos
I am so unbelievably happy abt this video thanks for sacrificing your sanity to appease your viewers, and top tier cinematography as usual
You say every margaritaville, and then dont come to the one in shreveport. So not every margaritaville, if you hate us in louisiana eddy, just say so :(
Oh god eddy please stop!
37:34 IVE BEEN THERE IVE BEEN THERE WOOOOOO YEAHHH BABYYY IVE BEEN THERE HEY IM FROM TENNESSEE
WHY DID YOU DO THIS AGAIN EDDY YOU MANIAC
I pray for your sanity Eddy, but I’m so thankful for your courage and determination. Great video!
Thank god you’re back. I am about through your entire video collection…  I am way to involved in this.
wait wait wait how did he pronounce biloxi
Eddie. (deeper voice) Eddy... (deepest voice) *Eddyyyyyyy.*
I’m starting to think that Ted is just some sort of demon tormenting Eddy. Ted’s pure joy in the face of Eddy’s fatigue strikes a primordial fear response in me.
as a fellow chicagoan, the bean also always makes me feel better
i rode the cat in the hat ride 12 times in a row with my fiancée. it was a nightmare. we only stopped because it broke down. 😂
Yes thank god
Planet Hollywood better be the third one of these
Eddy you can't keep doing this to yourself
holy fuck the sequel
Lol
It’s sad that as a Texas native I knew immediately exactly which Buc-ees you stopped at just from what it looked like 😂😂
I think you would’ve had more fun if you had worn the Margaritaville crocs.
holy shhit
go to every 7-11 next i dare u
Are we going to complete the trilogy with Bubba Gump Shrimp Co?🦐👀
Does Eddy just like to suffer? I mean either way I'm here for it.
Now do every McDonald's
Could you please eat at every McDonald's next
Wait, there's Margaritaville's in Canada?
I live in Florida and the rain IS a big deal!!! It’s slippery and scary, and nobody knows how to drive here!!!
What about the margaritaville in Conroe Texas???
i lold so hard when i saw the thumbnail
Inb4 you go to every Bubba Gump in the US and Canada. Nah but for real thanks for putting yourself through this for our entertainment! 🎉 You did it! 🎉
28:47 MANATEE
See you guys in an hour i gotta go for some popcorn for this one
Are you sure you want to become the “ I ate at every (blank)” guy ? I think you need to think this through.
EDDIE WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF FUCKING AGAIN
I never knew there would be a sequel
"You saw my toes for free and you owe me money" is an actually hilarious statement.
The word Jimmy doesn't feel like a word anymore from the amount of times I'm hearing it in this video.
Leave it to Eddy to do the things no one is asking anyone to do.
OHIO
Nakey Jakey!?
Thank you Eddy!!!!
What the hell Cleveland is the best place you guys traveled to. Do us dirty with that 30 second mention. Times Square got nothing on Cleveland
okay can this become a yearly series? 😂 next idea: eating at every bubba gump! there’s 22 locations in america!! there’s also dick’s last resort, medieval times, hard rock cafe, and señor frogs!!
I'd like to live all my life in margaritavilla
why did he do it again
the way i can now say i've been to both a rainforest cafe AND a margaritaville that eddy and ted have been to
do arby's
Welcome to the cult, Eddy! 🍹🍾🍻🏖🌞
EDDIE NO
If eating at different tropical restaurants across the country isn't broke don't fix it
A third time and he will die fr💀
Hard Rock Cafe next?
I love u eddy
I get excited every time a Spencer's appears in a youtube video. I worked there for 5 years it's like my home.
I love that Eddie says this is the final trip but we all know the trilogy must be completed
Jesus Eddy, are you doing okay?
what is wrong with you
Did you do this because you feel like you need to be punished for some reason because you're a good person and no one should have to do rainforest cafe and margaritaville.
EDDY!!! YOURE BEING BRAINWASHED BY JIMMY BUFFET!!! DONT YOU SEE!!!
You’ve got to do bubba gump shrimp now
You skipped lake Conroe margaritaville 😠
I got excited I thought you came to the margaritaville in Shreveport, Louisiana but I guess you didn't count the casinos lol. Either way youre a fucking masochist for doing this again
Hey, I’ve seen this one before! It’s a classic!
you guys should do the margaritville cruise haha
Why do you keep doing this to yourself?
Please go back to dollywood. You will not be disappointed
Wait Jimmy Buffet is a real Person?!
Eddy no please
WHAT ABOUT THE MARGARITAVILLE IN CAPITOLA?!
What's next? Bubba Gump Shrimp Company? Dick's Last Resort?
Hey man keep it up! You’ll blow up soon :3
Eddy I think it's time that we address your margarita addiction
Omg the thing Tucson mentioned
I can't wait for Teds optimistic counterpart video
Here me out...please visit all the remaining chuck e cheese's in the US!
I'm gonna see "WHAT IF" in that blue font in my nightmares
hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe  hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe hard rock cafe
A kid running up and stealing Eddy's second machine and him saying not a single word and just winning the game against them is too funny
How much would the uncensored video be
Alternative title: “I Jimmy so hard I Buff-it”
Eddy seriously went “let’s new game plus this shit”  Incredible
Does... Does this mean Bubba Gump 2024...
come to the uk and go to every gregs!
Final time? famous last words
Eddy, next year can y’all go to every Hard Rock Cafe? I feel like that would be really entertaining.
13:13 omg that musical sting was flawless
Let’s fucking go Eddie with a new unique kind of video
PLEASE go to dollywood for your next trip
@eddyburback you forgot the one at South Padre Island
Watching this video at the San Antonio mall staring at the Margaritaville sign across the food court. Full circle etc. etc.
When are you starting your own massive chain restaurant with all this research?
As a fellow Eddy, I can confirm it is written in the Code of Eddyrabi that we must drink Deep Eddy™if it is in a drink.  Also Hard Rock next year? 👀
Yo eddy you should now eat at every Cheesecake Factory or bubba gump shrimp!
Bubba Gump Shrimp next please
I've never actually seen a shirt as amazing as the one shown @27:27 and to find out that not only is it amazing, that i can own it too, what a marvelous day
Eddie saying “for the final time” about embarking on a trip was just as confident as the perfect margarita—suspicious and possibly not true. we will see where they tour next year
Next year it's gonna be visiting every Buc-ee's
Lol i love visiting the thing sneaking in drinks on trips 😂
I want this to become a series and the finale is an intervention
omg goat did it again
not again
This is crazy, just finished rewatching the rainforest cafe video for like the 3rd time
How did you manage to record in universal
Oh my god I am so excited
Eddy you don't gotta hurt yourself like this
Living in Minnesota, I was wondering if he’d remember where the rainforest cafe is lol
By Talos he did it again  Watching the Rainforest Cafe one with my husband is one of my favorite memories. I cannot wait to show this to him tonight
Release the toe cut Eddy.
I just watched this and didn't notice you both attending the Margaritaville in the Harrahs in south lake Tahoe. Video is a lie?
yall missed out. the panama city beach location used to have waitresses on stilts. not kidding.
Does Eddy make it to PR's Margaritaville? Maybe a great followup trip! :D
Hard Rock Cafe next
Yessss!!!
The dedication of this man is insane and this video deserves all the views
I loved the unexpectedly wholesome Atlanta margaritaville experience. People can be so cool, helpful, and understanding sometimes.
honestly so happy that you decided to make another vid like this! these types of videos dont get made often so i love that you made a second, keep it up man💞
Eddy all of 2024: I visited every McDonald’s in the world
So impressed that Ted and Eddy can both make a video with identical content, together, and know they'll have equally entertaining unique videos
Now eat at every McDonald's
Dude I’m from Florida, and those rainy interstate drives are terrifying.
Jimmy Buffett on the TV is how Joe Biden thinks he sounds.
Again first rainforest your stomach must be hurting
Eddie, I’m very concerned. Why do you keep doing this?
Eddy's Bizarre Adventure: Margarita Mayhem
Really excited to see what your 2024 roadtrip will be!!
God I love this channel
this is such weird timing i just got home from a trip to the one in georgia 💀
The sequel literally nobody asked for. But the sequel everyone needed.
Please please please try the margaritaville cruise!
Didn't realize I was a big Edd Headd until I got really excited for this. You inspire.
Eddie, this is just masochism at this point.
But that being said capitola is a pretty cool little town
Ted showing up later in the video with THE THING? shirt is sending me hahaha
Shout out to the Atlantan Margaritaville restaurant! GOAT! Any shop/store would say no to any customer coming after it closes (for very good reasons, that's a plague to any retail), but they still did it!
oh my god there's a sequel i am so happy
Commenting before watching. The one in Capitola sucks bowadays but 15 years ago it had different owners and supposedly better
soooo next year can be the american girl cafe road trip?
you know if you ever decide to do a third franchise road trip you have to meet the guy again
Great job with this one Eddy! I really enjoyed watching you suffer as I suffer at work! Just kidding thank you for making my day much, much mo bettrah! You guys can do a winter Planet Hollywood episode!? If you guys are up for some more torture!
Omg the rainforest cafe flashbacks are killin me 😂
This is the greatest day of my life
But somehow you screwed up Biloxi, Mississippi
Ed....when the heck did you change your profile pic from your great Luigi pic .....man.....it was such an iconic Luigi Eddy picture now gone....😢....I please urge you to change it back. The current one is quite good. Like a blinking picture. But nothing can beat the Luigi imo.
Another masterpiece eddy
Your use of sarcasm is an art form lol.
i’m begging you to do another one of these in hopes that you run into that same young texan again
Sorry, I’ve not finished the video yet, I’ve never been to one of these places, but do they NOT have a Jimmy Buffet buffett??
My god he's done it again
as a clevelander, nothing can describe the visceral reaction i had to the tim misny billboard making the video
LMAO WTF that cat in the hat ride is actually insane. Why. They have infinity money and they use it to haunt children's dreams
Need to savour every moment of this
Do McDonald’s next
The casino in Tulsa also isn't owned by Margaritaville Eddy. Native Americans have exclusive gaming rights in Oklahoma and the River Spirit Casino is owned by the Muscogee Nation
I ate at the Margaritaville in Key West, I got ribs and they were pretty damn tasty.
Adding Canada to the skit is my favourite part
Can’t for next year’s trip, probably going to every Bubba Gump’s Shrimp Company restaurant. Wait, no…
Oh Eddy, didn't you know? Braden died twenty years ago..... 😳
Watching 6:15 while sitting on the toilet bleeding and dealing with stomach cramps is transcendent in some way
AAAAAND CANADAAAA
I eat at every waffle House in the country for 2024 ?
Eddy is collecting the infinity stones of bad tourist restaurants.
I just rematches the rainforest Cafe video a few days ago, so excited to watch the sequel!
Eddie. Do not. I repeat, do not. Do not go to an entire nation’s worth of dated, themed chain restaurants again. Please Eddie. Please do not do this to yourself anymore.
As a disillusioned Florida resident, one of the only things I LOVE about this state is our natural environments. I'm glad you enjoyed our beaches and hope you return :)
YES!
The road to Margaritaville leads only to ruin.
Absolutely so here for this, this place has always been an enigma to me seeing signs for it going through branson. I also would confuse warren and jimmy buffet as a child
you should eat at every mcdonald’s next.
Why skip jacksonville Florida?
Babe wake up, Eddy did it again!
You can't beat the 4:00 am Buc-ees experience
Tummy Hort
And in 2024: EVERY BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP!
Tacoma seats are soooooo uncomfortable. I'm amazed you survived
Every aspect of florida in this video, completely normal 😅
unfortunately one of the first dates my girlfriend and i ever went on was to the chicago navy pier margaritaville. the waiter bullied me because i wasn't eating fast enough and we were conned into buying a weird little keychain with a picture of us in it. the food was okay and i would probably go back
Here we go again
Wait drinking and driving HELL YAY
the return of the king
I applaud you for getting the pronunciation of New Orleans, correct
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Now do every dicks last resort
24:55 ad skip
wait till he finds out about Jimmy Buffett's other restaurant chain, "Cheeseburger in Paradise"
I'm not saying I came up with this idea, but I *did* mention on your Rainforest Cafe video that you should go to Margaritaville in Niagara Falls, Canada.
i think im early maybe
Do bubba gump shrimp co next lmao
Love you and your content man ❤❤❤❤❤
eddie.
I'm glad to see the Misny billboards made it in the video. 😂
MEDIEVAL TIMES DINNER AND TOURNAMENT NEXT YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
At what point is this considered some level of self harm?
Hey Ma! The funny mustache man did the thing again!
Medford OR?
Can’t wait for Ted’s pov where he hates it at first and gets slowly hypnotized by jimmy the incomprehensible god
You missed the cruise ship lol So fucking full unless you’re drunk 😭 Edit: The food there is so sad, especially if you go to their “fancy” restaurant… Also my only knowledge of Jimmie is MB, MB, and Me…(?) 😅 Edit: welp… nvm then 😅 I saw a cruise ship
He’s done it again..
This video means a lot to me because it’s nice to see the places you grew up in and haven’t seen in a while and watch people experience them for this first time.
You son of a gun. You madman. You did it again.
THIS VIDEO WAS MADE FOR ME SPECIFICALLY I WANNA GO TO MARGARITAVILLE SO BAD AAAAAA
What's next, Chili's? Hard Rock Cafe? Planet Hollywood?
Final time? Haha no sir there are bubba Gumps to visit
This video is such a mirror for the Rain forest. Where in that Ted was a cultist for the rain forest and Eddy was the one suffering. Now Eddy is the one becoming the Cultist…
As someone not from the US, I'm imagining this as some sort of odd pilgrimage. And also I'm hungry. Better keep these places in mind if or when I ever visit.
So…planet Hollywood next?
It’s very weird that you blur your feet. Just show them… please
0:34 this lighting make it look like youre wearing the glasses nose miustache disguise
Great vid bro.😺
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN 🦅🦅🦅🦅🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish i could grow a mustache like Eddy.
I'm  only 7 minutes in, and I CANNOT WAIT to see what next year's road trip is going to be XD
I'm from Panama City and it is really weird seeing it in a video.
the beeeeeeeeeest
Back at it I see
Since Eddy’s clearly going the distance, I nominate next years restaurant road trip to be Medieval Times
y r u doing this to yourself ;~;
I live very close to El Paso and seeing you guys go to the Pistachio last time and the Thing this time is so surreal for me. This is the stuff my childhood was made of
It goes without saying that Bubba Gump Shrimp will come calling
Was honestly not expecting this video at all but here we are and honestly thank you o(￣▽￣)ｄ
I love these 😹
King
eddie my heart skipped a beat when i saw the notification i love you thank you for your service once again🫡
Jax?
10/10 would do again for all the mcdonalds in the us
The king has risen again
fk yes
I want to see Eddy go to multiple dinner theatre shows I feel like that would be a fun I ate at every _ video
eddie, we love these, they’re so funny, but please i think you need to stop doing this to yourself 😭 who is making you do this
do hard rock cafe next! come on you like being miserable
NOT AGAIN
yall have to go to all the hard rock cafes
buck deez nuts
Bucces yeah
Up next gotta be Bubba Gump
Next is eating at every McDonalds in the country
Are you trying to anger the allmighty economy??
oh my god no not again.
Do Bubba Gump next. I dare you.
This is maximum level dedicated shitposting in human form and i love it!
I vote next time you do a tour of weird road side attractions, and like small mom and pop diners/motels. These weird huge commercial places don't deserve your time or hilarious commentary.
Oh my god he did it gain
No because I’ve re-watched the rainforest atleast 10 times. Jaw dropped when I saw this post!!!
this video made me feel like jimmy buffet
why would you do this again
To know true joy one must know true misery. Thank you Ed.
Medieval Times Eddy. Complete the trilogy
It feels like I've seen this before
I grew up about an hour and a half away from Pier Park. The PCB segment was such a nostalgia blast.  Edit: I also go to school in SoFlo and travel to Orlando often. Plus I’m a huge Buffet fan, so this video is really right up my alley lmao.
Can’t wait for him to get to every McDonald’s in the Country
If I had a nickel for every time that a guy named Jimmy gained a cult-like following and opened a chain restaurant in order to become uber rich, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t much, but it’s strange that it happened twice.
Now this is what you call quality entertainment. I already can't wait for next year, this absolutely needs to be a trend.
Just remember Eddy, God gives his strongest soldiers the biggest tummy aches
can't wait to see ted's pov where he is having the time of his life
EDDY WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS TO YOURSELF
I live like 5 minutes from teh margaritaville village you stayed at in orlando and those cottages are actaully houses you can buy. Chrisy could really live at Margaritaville.
Oh it is time for another road tripppp
A man should do it and it should be you.
"I think it might be tinnitus"  underrated comment!
Next time you're in minnesota can you go somewhere with good food I don't want MOA chain restaurants to be your culinary experience here lol
I just got back from key west and this is so accurate
I'm not impressed eddy. Now you have to go to every Macdonalds
eddie will now be forced into going to every restaurant chain
I can’t believe you did this to yourself again
Medieval Times next!
I literally just finished watching your Rainforest Cafe video for the first time. Thank you for waiting for me before continuing your journey king 💪👑🤳
Next year... Hard Rock Cafe?
@eddy there is a new one in South Padre Island TX so you missed one.
LONG HAVE I WAITED
I swear it's not just the energy and direction of the video but ol' Eddy-9pi...10pins  just has the best little touches. Whether it is interrupting his narration for an alien butt or the absurd cutaways to the movie theater (Morbius) bathroom soap dispensers. God I love ya Eddie. and HEY, Jarvis!
See you next year for “I ate at every Hardrock Cafe in the Country” or “I ate at every Tony Roma’s in the Country”
I have nothing to comment, but the dedication to making this deserves my engagement.  So here ya go!
congrats on the magnum opus eddy
Never thaught I would see someone get PTSD from rainforest cafe.
He continues to do gods work, thank you brother Eddy.
Y’all passed my favorite restaurant in Florida, killer place right on the water.
hope to see you do all the bubba gump shrimp co.'s next year!
The Cat in the Hat ride is the most vivid memory I have of my childhood trip to Universal when I was like 5. I cried so much
I can't believe he did it again. Are you ok Eddy??
Every resort** I live in a margaritaville community and you didn’t come here bruuuther
I just wanna know what your credit card company says about these charges…
for the second and "final" time yeah sure okay
Eddy Burback, our favorite tummyache survivor
The fact that Eddy does not know how to pronounce Biloxi is driving me crazy
We are so fucking Eddy Burback!
hell yeah on the catfish platter bro!
Eddy saying for the second and final time as if hes not gonna do this atleast 1 more time
Eddy, I needed this, I love you
have you considered eating at every Hard Rock Cafe
NOOO EDDY WHY NOT AGAIN YOU ARE KILLING YOURSELF AAAAHHHHHHH
THERE IS ONE IN TULSA :c
I didn't ask you to do that
@EddyBurback you need to investigate, why there are so many mattress stores next to each other throughout the country.
Yes, Eddy. You are the King of Stinky Feet.
My boyfriend and I are doing this on our honeymoon
I was expecting you to visit the Margaritaville Resort in Palm Springs but looks like you missed it. You'll have to do the whole trip all over again !
This is exactly the kind of madness I needed to watch today. Oh no
a sequel to the best video last year? a man torturing himself once again for our entertainment? don't mind if i do.
Eddie you should try this small town restaurant called subway! It wouldn’t take too long
why is racist minecraft guy here
I think Brayden has to go to every Texas Roadhouse with you!!!
My god he did it again
Amazing stuff, i was really hoping to a sequel to Rainforest Cafe and this is perfect.
I literally was recommended to re-watch the first one yesterday. What are the odds?
Love the role reversal between Ted and Eddy in this one
I have never heard of that place
This seems like eddy just trying to get revenge on Ted
Seeing destiny mall (as crappy as it is) really brought back memories. I moved from East to West coast as a kid and left all my relatives and friends behind. It's been years since I've visited and it's nice to get a snapshot of something from my past, even if it's for such a silly reason.
loool bros running out of ideas next vid boutta be like "I ate at every outback steakhouse in the country" (jk eddie love you)
Was not expecting JSchlatt to make a cameo
Was just waiting for another eddy burback video
What a legend to go through such a journey twice 😂
HE IS BACK
2 out of his last 5 videos have been eating at every of x restaurant across the country lol.
I've never been to one and I never want to
Honestly the Canada restaurant looks unironically kinda... nice???
You absolute madman. You'll have failed Jimmy B if you don't do this a third time
Can’t wait for next year when they visit every buba gump location
You were in my hometown Miami and I would have totally come and hated the food with you!
Next year you should do Bubba Gump
Oh my god, he’s done it again.
Yoo, you've been to a place I live, that's epic.
This is slowly becoming a cult documentary I think
No Eddy!!! You can't eat at every Rainforest Cafe AND every Margaritaville!!! No one is meant to have such power!!!
Do Guy Fieri's restaurants next
You could say he was "wasting away again in Margaritaville"!!!
...oh no
Never heard of this place, but im hyped since I love rainforest cafe so much and that video on it in turn.
Yeah, cause eddy looks like he runs 8:00
eddy no why
i love the the thing shirts worn after the thing happened
BUBBA GUMPS NEXT!!!!!!!!????
HES DONE IT AGAIN!!! WE CANT STOP HIM! HES TOO POWERFUL!
“Wasting away here in Margaritaville” -Eddy by the 5th restaurant probably
Request from Sevan: Can you do mcdonald's next? Thank you 👍
Next video Eddy eats at every Dollywood in America
If I had a nickle for every time Eddy went to every restaurant in a chain in the USA I'd have 2 nickles. Which is not a lot, but weird that it happened twice.
A fantastic sequel to the Rainforest Cafe video. Much love Eddy, will always be a supporter!
NOOOOO EDDY WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR PFP
Up next: HardRock Cafe
Casa Bonita next?
you never learn
The cameo of “schlatt” made the video way better
eddy burback marry me
Bro was it a coincidence that schlatt appears in this vid right after a 9/11 reference..... I think NOT
As someone from south Mississippi, this video is a religious experience. We worship Jimmy. Thank you for making this.  PS you pronounced my city wrong….
Hope any patreon subs got to see those tosies
Bubba Gump next
THE SEQUEL NOBODY EXPECTED YES LETS GO
Next: I Ate at Every McDonald's in the Country
Now you gotta go to every Burger King in the Country
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiit eddy you're looking straight up handsome
this is lowkey my dream
Midsommar for men
Now do it for every McDonalds
Jesus Christ, Eddy
Next Road Trip: “I ate at every restaurant in the world!”
The rainforest cafe videos are my comfort vids at the moment so a new installment only adds to the wonder
so what i’m understanding is that the canadian version of chain restaurants is always better than the american one
An artist named Homer Tate made The Thing and a bunch of other gaffs, super interesting stuff and a weird life!
what will be next??? bubba gump???
i hope one day eddy accomplishes his goal of eating at every restaurant in america with a decorative volcano
Eddy you have blessed us on this day
This video was okay, but the guy who made it was named Eddy ? I aint listening to no dude named Eddy
Eddy this trip has changed you. You've now become Deep Eddy
4:18
Never heard of this restaurant and yet I'm still sad after googling it and finding out the one closest to me (Times Square) is closing, as if overpriced margaritas aren't Times Square's bread and butter and I don't visit my stepfather in Florida often.
Bro said run that back
"I beat the child."
You could say he was wasting away again in Margaritaville
Oh god, another one
I worked at the Margaritaville waterpark in Georgia. Working 60 hours a week listening to his songs constantly will drive you insane.
if justin mcelroy hears about this he'll go into cardiac arrest
again seriously
Now you're Jeddy Burfet
I got roofied at the Las Vegas Blvd Margaritaville and ended up in jail, I can only give it 1 star
I live in Nova Scotia, there would be a riot if someone got served those fish and chips here
Hope he sees this, king
I'm liking this video preemptively because Destin is where I grew up.
That’s actually how bucky’s gets it’s staff. All the lost children become stockers and cashiers. If they misbehave they become Bucky’s bbq ribs.
Eddie you can't keep doing this to yourself buddy. Blink twice if you need help
i’m from florida and the rain isn’t so bad. it’s me that’s dangerous.
Now do every McDonald’s in the country
I saw the title/thumbail and audibly said "ain't NO WAY"
Is it just me or did Eddie's monologue on the beach give off Health Ledger's Joker vibes?
2:38 wow idk city wok from south park was a real place
you need help
Jimmy would take his private jet to St Barts and get his private chef to make him a meal.  I live in St Bart’s (I’m a normal person not a 1%er) and this is where the little corner cafe where Cheeseburger in paradise was written.. it’s called (Le Select). He’s a bit of a local legend here (I cringe) and thanks to his mediocre cult I mean restaurant chain, has a ridiculously beautiful villa here, private hers, chefs… only the best for him… the irony cuts deep.  I will say that he’s supposedly very nice to his staff. But yea, there’s the fact that he has a staff. Your video seems to have somehow indirectly conveyed that irony well. Bravo 👏  Ps: chef’s kiss on the musical choice after opening and closing: (vivaldi?)
Oh no, not again!
Despite spending 24 full days eating at the most delectable restaurant on earth, Eddie is looking FIT
I've been dreaming of this day
How much fuel do these trips use 😂
The way i just smiled after seeing this notification. Thanks for your service 🥹🦜🍹
eddy’s pronunciation of biloxi is cracking me up hahahaha
Kinda trash
The first 5 minutes were honestly me waiting in suspense to see if Eddy was travelin with Ted again or taking the journey solo
I saw the title and my impulse reaction was simply 'WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF'
Once again, very high effort stuff. Congratulations!
Can't wait to see Ted's side where he goes psychotic
Thanks eddy for not showing your dogs
You know my first thought when I saw this in my recommended was “Eddie what have you done this time…” first rainforest now this?!
Visiting every Hard Rock Cafe when?
I hate to point this out but there is a Margaritaville in the Miami Airport!
eddy buffett
well i'm from florida and the rain isn't such a big deal
I’m so happy right now. Bless you Eddy for enduring this twice
I NEED A BUBBA GUMP ONE!! #senteddytotherapy
gimmie them toes
My favorite part was ted beating the everloving crap out of the minions and eddy pleading him to stop😂
Oh my god it's the fucking super bowl
How dare you disrespect my clan’s leader Binkley-sama!
You gotta keep stepping up this game man. 3 years from now youll be on a death march to eat at every Cracker Barrel wishing this country fried steal would kill ya.
strap in boys, here we go again
i’ve never been to one ever but maybe i do wanna live all my life in margaritaville
The Cat in the Hat ride is cursed. In fact, my family and I went to Universal years ago, and at 30:55 we got stuck on the ride and they had to escort us on foot off the ride and shut the ride down for the day because of a mechanical issue. I can still hear the sounds of The Cat going "WoooAaahhhh" in my head right now.
I stayed at one of the Margaritaville hotels in Florida with my girlfriend some years ago. We got one of those expensive sound-side rooms and it was beautiful. The constantly looping Jimmy Buffet music in the lobby, the gym with the TV permanently stuck on the Tonight Show, the uncanny tropical birds painted all over the walls of your room, the $13 bucket containing two water bottles, the framed picture of Jimmy Buffet on the bedside table watching you grind uglies. True Margaritaville Magic through and through.
The fact that you rented a vehicle to travel all over the country... and went with a giant ass gas guzzling truck... America is fucking doomed.
The amount of times I said “uh oh” throughout watching this video
the sequal literally no one asked for
oh how the tables have turned,.,,
eddy not again
I live not far from “The Thing” and as a kid it was $.25 to get in and it was just one little room with the mummy and like a horse and carriage.
jimmy buffet just shit his pants
YESS🫵😔
I had to do a double take because I never would have expected a SECOND cross-country trip visiting shitty chain restaurants. Truly a creator beyond our deserving.
Why did you do it agAin
Yessssssssss I watch the jungle theme restaurant one all the time
I've been waiting for a video like this ever since you went to every single rain forest cafe, god bless you Eddy!
i guess he truly is wasting away again…
that "Stinky Feet" water gun shooting gallery thing feels like a real life version of those creepy elsa games
Go on the cruise next.
Dude the guy who met you in both videos is the mvp
ahhhh thank you so much for stopping at the pigeon forge location!!! it was so cool to have met you eddie!!!
Sometimes a YouTube video is so important you need to drop everything to watch it
this is so excellent
Why do you keep doing this to yourself? 😂
It took me five minutes to realize that jimmy buffet ≠ warren buffet
Next year Eddy and Ted will do a video titled "I ate at every McDonalds in the Country".
this. this is truly an art form of the gods. these videos are just pure bliss
i was NOT prepared for this video
You missed the margaritaville in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri 😡
Now to do this with Hard Rock / Planet Hollywood next
New idea. Eddy goes to every town in the country that has Eddy in the name. For example, I grew up in Long Eddy, NY.
Can't wait for Every Hard Rock Cafe 2024!
He’s doing a sequel!
38:00
Perfect, I just ordered food
I don't say this lightly, but Eddy you are an absolute goon for doing this.
Brantley from Texas let you upload from his basement....how kind of him.
I love how Jordan has become a model for his friends' merch lol
Eddie in Biloxi!?!?
Eddy please return me back to my family I miss them so much
I've sat at that exact table at the Margaritaville at the LA CityWalk
Why not a SUV? LOL why so brand loyal to Tacoma?
I did NOT expect a sequel, but I'm grateful for it.
"For the last time" I'm holding my breath til next year when Eddy and Ted make it to every Bubba Gump's
the only thing i know about jimmy buffet is that i am distantly related to him. and he is very popular with retired folk in florida.
The Rainforest Cafe video is one of my favorite YouTube videos of all time. The storytelling in these videos is incredible. 😂
That dog is so cool.
the bucees interlude made my Texan ass smile
why
I ate a lot of garlic before this and it wasn't a good combo
oh god, not again
did you take little eddy on this journey?
To know what every single stupid chain restaurant is like, I'm pleased to say, that Eddy Burback has your back.
Getting into the city walk margaritaville was probably more expensive than the food
finally a video i can get behind
as someone who lives in san antonio, you weren’t feeling the presence of the rainforest cafe. you were just in san antonio LMAOOO (no one likes it here)
Eddy not again
why?
bubba gump shrimp
"I ate at every BubbaGump" when?
Im so excited to see the one in Connecticut. I went there with girl scouts! I dream about that ceiling Volcano and that Princess ( I think Mia) drink. I dont know if I hallucinated a whole Margaritaville
If you really hated your self you'd go to Every mid-evil times.
Bro did the same lie twice
Even the intro is the same, god I love you Eddy
Drugs
Margarita size me
I don't know why I'm so hyped for this considering I have never heard of this restaurant before. Then again, it's the same with the rainforest café
You’re a madman.
Im assuming this is just gonna be a yearly thing now, what’s gonna be the next restaurant eddster?
Oh, Eddie, not again…
2024 Hard Rock Cafe gonna be lit
I’ve been WAITINGGG FOR THIS!!!!
Nothing has made me click faster than thinking of you wasting away in Margaritaville lol
“Searching for my lost shaker of salt… oh, here it is.”
as a brit learning about two restaurants i didnt know existed from eddie burback
Gods strongest warrior (Eddy) fighting his toughest battles (eating at every obscure restaurant in the nation and Canada)
You utter madman.
this video is such a sweet little treat
Looks like Eddy is wastin' away in Margaritaville.
What is wrong with you? Why do this again? Eddy i am worried f- Oh ted is here!
It’s so surreal seeing the margaritaville in Myrtle Beach in this video since I went there before. Like, seeing the ceiling hurricane brought back so many memories
"pour me something tall and strong" is Alan Jackson you fake fan
The Sequel we never knew we needed
0:14 What the dog doin? 13:39 Oh my God, they were roommates! 16:56 Strides over.  Plays Stinky Feet on someone else's dime.  Refuses to elaborate further.  Leaves. 4 years old and already a GigaChad.
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Oh NO! He’s done it again!! He can’t keep getting away with this!!
I don't know why, but much like the Rainforest Cafe trip, I feel like this would be kinda fun
We thank you for your service !
Welp... I didn’t know I needed it, but I'm fully ready for the "I went to every ______ in the country" saga to continue.
so nice of eddy to drop this right before im going on a one hour car ride. this is the best day of my fucking life thank you eddy
Gonna be difficult traveling the entire country and not being greeted by the same animatronic gorilla.
Bro was board
cmon eddy, do hard rock café. do it, eddy.
Can't wait for the "I ate in every McDonald" in 25 years.
Excuse me?!
The sequel no one asked for, but wanted
Take me with you next time you do a country food tour....fucker
YESSSSS
The Binklys are not happy about this one
Oh not again.
this is BIG if true
Oh fuck hes done it again
thank you for such wonderful content
I was genuinely stressed for the first six minutes that Ted would not be involved in this
Hey! They’re opening one in my county in FL! I’ve never been but now that I’ve seen you go to all of them EXCEPT the new one by me, I guess I’ll have to try it—just in case the experience is different than the 22 experiences you had 😅
Sometimes the sequel is better.
Ouch.
Oh my god he did it again
Eddy no, why?
26:32 Found my new forever wallpaper.
Nice job Eddy! This is an intriguing and thought provoking video about christianity
We thank you for your service
Planet Hollywood next!
38 years I have had to suffer the cult of Buffett, I had to grow up with pictures of this man on my wall. I feel for your sanity at the end of this.
You should do one of these every summer
Was any of this food available via a ghostkitchen?
Oh fuck
This is just the fever dream you had after visiting every Rainforest Cafe
I really appreciate you visiting the thing cause as an Arizonan I've seen the billboards my whole life and always wondered what it was but never actually cared enough to see it for myself so ty for answering this for me
Eddie 2023: “for the second and last time, we hit the road for our adventure.”  Eddie 2024: “We have went to every single Hard Rock Cafe in the WORLD.”
Now you gotta eat at every McDonald's in the country.
He's back at it again!!
Now do it again!!! 😈
Eddy don’t you know the definition of insanity?
Never clicked on a video so fast
The fact that the sponsor segment is done while in Florida, but that the product is explicitly not available there, is so funny
Seriously Eddy, please stop. No one finds this whole “Eddy Burback” guy funny. Just give the channel back to Tony.
you doing all this for tax purposes?
Ah shit, here we go again.
The sequel we needed
There’s on in development in Newport, KY too
If this place is anything like the song Cheeseburger in Paradise I'm sure it's awful
Is this gonna become a yearly thing
"Jimmy Buffett cult" is a plot point in the Yacht Rock web series
Saving vegas for last. Wise. Hopeful that someday you can come to vegas and eat at one of our good restaurants instead of crap.
22:15 is that dennis?????
The sequel we never knew we so desperately needed
No one is going to read this or care but right after you and Ted did your Rainforest Café videos, my sister and I legit planned this exact thing (including the international ones though) logistically, and we were going to do it. I'm glad someone lived out our dream :')
Holy shit I just re-watched the rainforest cafe video yesterday?? Amazing. This is my favorite content.
Eddy.... it's okay to not do these things. we can get you help.
Babe wake up, Eddy Burback suffered cross country at subpar chain restaurants again!!!!
What a mad lad
I'm so glad Ted is on board. My favorite thing about the Rainforest cafe trip is how starkly different their experiences were.
As a New Mexican, when I saw "The Thing?!" on screen I both laughed and screamed
do bubba gump next
"We hit the road for the second [...]" that is correct "[...] and last time" No, Eddy, you know it won't be
Noooo Eddy. Nooooo. You crazy man. Man, don't waste away in Margaritaville.  That joke does not work, I am aware but I couldn't very call you a Cheeseburger in Paradise, because I don't think you were in Paradise. That is also an entirely different restaurant and wouldn't really work, oh, nevermind.
I'm screaming. I just rewatched the Rainforest Cafe video yesterday for kicks and today this comes out??
The trick about the perfect margarita is that you’re supposed to use two types of tequila, some of the restaurants don’t do it. It gets you real gone real fast, not for the taste.
eddy you can’t keep doing these things
ted nivison headaaaaaaaaa
"Final time" Until we hit ALL THE BUBBA GUMP SHRIMPS IN THE COUNTRY
Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne (of the themed-restaurant industry)
I think otter insurance which is actually an email scam to get insurance offers through third-party subscription came out of Bucky's that is the straight up otter insurance logo they use on the scam
The man with the best mustache is here
I have to say that I appreciate Eddy being consistent and having all of the still photos of the menu be blurry as shit. 😂
This man might love pain. No disrespect to Margaritaville, but that is a LOT of them
The only time I ever dine and dashed was at a Margaritavilla in Turks & Caicos.  Zero regrets.
not now honey, eddy just dropped another hour long video of himself on a chain restaurant pilgrimage
I have never had a worse restaurant experience than eating at Margaritaville in Miami
Return of the road trip let's go! Lmao
I LIVE IN SYRACUSE HAHAHAHA AND ID NEVERRRRR EAT THERE
The Rainforest Cafe is the family restaurant version of Margaritaville. Not only can I not be convinced otherwise, this was genuinely not a thing I realized until this was uploaded. Thank you, Eddie 🫡
My grandpa and Jimmy Buffet were roommates in college, they’ve been good friends since, Ik he would be proud of you
do mcdonalds next
I've worked at the lake  Lanier Margaritaville for almost a year, and i now have a burning hatred for jimmy and his songs
EVERY MCDONALD!!!!!
You need to try the cruise now.
Please do every cracker barrel next 😊 I love all of your content 🩵
This man hates himself
Immediately added to my sleep playlist
literally the other day I was reading about Margaritaville and thought, “I wonder if anyone’s ever eaten at every single one?” and then realized that Eddy was probably in the middle of doing that. Glad to see I was right
The one in shreveport has gotta be the worst one fr didn’t see that one in here
Thank you for your sacrifice Eddy! Your sanity will be missed
I wanna have this kind of money
you missed the air magiratville in san juan puerto rico airport
So glad you decided to make this poor decision. Good job.
Eddy, you would have no way of knowing this but I have a season pass to a local theme park and it is a tradition every time I go for me to play stinky feet in the arcade. My boyfriend hates it and doesn’t understand why it’s so funny to me, but you do… thank you Mr. Burback.
Return of the king.
The Margaritaville at City Walk was also in the show Jury Duty.
Okay guys now up next is eating at every Hard Rock Cafe in the country
He did it again.
I hope this becomes an annual series. May I suggest camping at every Jellystone Campground in 2024, or eating at every Hard Rock Cafe
i'm predicting that next year he goes to every hard rock cafe in the us and canada
Justin McElroy is quaking in his boots right now
oh my god dude
Go to every Subway in the US next
Eddy was a block away from my apartment and i didn't know 😪
FINALLY something else to watch besides Eddy’s and Ted’s rainforest cafe videos on loop. Great video Eddy! Can’t wait for Ted’s version
WE ARE BACK
Bitch I thought u were joking 😭
You really are something. I don't know what, just a positive force but also a little bit crazy.
Petition for Eddy to do a Bubba Gump Shrimp Company tour next.
Now as someone who has never been to a margaritaville Or rainforest cafe i want to completely copy this entire video again
If I had a nickle for every time Eddy ate at all of one specific restaurant, I'd have 2 nickles, which isn't a lot, but it's weird it's happened twice.
my late uncle loved jimmy buffet and he would have loved this vid:)
can’t wait for ted’s video where he goes insane
Eddy not again
I just finished the other video and now this.....        thank you
why did you do this again ed
Eddy's mental well-being is wasting away in Margaritaville
I mean I've never eaten at a margaritaville but i have got incredibly drunk in one and honestly 10/10 experience
This is my Oppenheimer
I don't know if its cause I was raised by boomers (neither of which like Jimmy though my mom loves the beach) or what to me Margaritaville is the most boomer thing ever in my mind
9000 miles in 24 days FFFFF
EDDIE NO NOT AGAIN
Eddy, im not sure if your body can physically handle this again.
You're a madman
To the hero we never knew we needed. You are the true cheeseburger in paradise
Do Bubba Gump Shrimp next
yo holy crap eddy you're so tall and huge and cool and not short!
why
Lol, rent a car to not ruin Ted's truck, decides to rent a truck for no reason lol
go to every McDonalds in America
This is pro level, but expert level is only listening to Jimmy Buffet while driving lol.
margaritaville better send you your bag Eddy
the madman did it again…
Now ya need to go to the ones everywhere else :))
Wait didn't you make this video before?
so you loved rainforest cafe that much, huh?
you get a larger audience from innovating like with the 1st in this series. Not just churning out “content” when something does well…
i literally gasped when i got the notification for this
Yuo should do evry MAC DOMALDS IN america & canadada
Litterly watched the other one yesterday
can’t wait for a few years from now when Eddy does this with McDonalds
bro i love these vid keep it up
The rainforest cafe video was iconic and now we have been blessed with this ! Ready for this to be an ongoing series
"final time"
I was wondering where you've been 😆
Why hurt yourself like this? You think its funny? Cause it is.
Im getting dejavu, idk why
Every Hard Rock Cafe next? 👀
Not the sequel we deserved, but the sequel we needed.
babe wake up, eddy and ted found yet another excuse to eat out for a month!
And yet, after all this, he still hasn't found his lost shaker of Salt.
Perfect timing Eddy, thank you! This is my first day home after being in hospital 5 weeks and I'm a lil daunted, this upload gives me something to fall asleep to.  Much appreciated 🙏.
Eddy you mad man. You have to stop
the mad lad, he did it again
this is the best birthday gift i could have asked for, thank you eddy
did the volcano burp
why would you subject yourself to this again?
“What if Winston Churchill’s butler was a alien” having its own dedicated exhibit separate from the WW2 one in the museum is so unbelievably dumb that I couldn’t stop myself from laughing in public
Ill be real you wont find me dead in a margaritaville restaurant but that first hotel looks pretty sweet
0:40 yes yes yes 😭🫶🏻
The sequel we didn't deserve!
Eddie, are you okay?
he suffers for us, like jesus with a better moustache
do one a year you wont
He’s done it again
I saw this pop up on my home page and immediately said "OHHHH NO EDDYYYYYYY"
biLOX-ee💀
NO FUCKING WAY
fuck yes, i'm so happy you did this again. the rainforest cafe vid is one of my favorite youtube vids ever, i find myself re-watching it often. thanks for the awesome content and thanks for risking your sanity for our entertainment
jschlatt jumpscare
IS IT REALLY THAT TIME AGAIN
there must be a lot of floridian cigarette grandmas for there to be that many margaritavilles
Oh my gosh not again 😂
Just once I want it to be clickbait Eddy I am worried about you
Eddy I hope you know you're responsible for me going to Rainforest in Nashville, so how dare you make me go to Margaritaville
Good lord he's at it again
Wow they really cleaned up The Thing exhibit. When I went it was just out in the open
....why....why would you do something like this for a SECOND TIME?!
eddy, no... no... eddy...
finally another video of a guy torturing himself on youtube! my thursday is saved
Is this a thing now?
Oh boy I bet Eddy has a lot more fun going to every Margaritaville surely nothing will go wrong!
Babe wake up, new Eddie destroying his own mental health just dropped
1:02 the thematic counterpoint of using Vivaldi’s Winter for a breakdown of Jimmy Buffet’s career is beautiful
I can't wait for the Bubba Gump video to finish the greatest trilogy in restaurant video history
Those weird boats you saw in Destin are Tiki Boats you can rent. If you bring your own alcohol, they provide a bartender. Tourists love it
WHY Eddy? Why do you keep doing this to yourself?
Eddy's back HAS to hurt from carrying the gimick-restaurant industry.
god yes
I just rewatched the Rainforest Cafe video this mornign and thoguht there should be another one. Did I will this into existance? probably
At this rate he’ll go insane by the time he goes to every macaroni grill.
NOTTT AGAINNNNN
No. Fucking. Way.
WOWW so you’ll eat at every margaritaville in the country (and Canada) and you can’t even come over to my house ONE TIME to try my special family recipe of chicken a La mode ™️?? 🤔Fr?  okay I see how it is mustache boy 🤣
HE'S BACK
Where can I get the uncensored toe "foot"-age?
okay, now do every cheesecake factory
Every time I’m like, yo why haven’t I seen a Eddy video in awhile. This. This is why.
as the child of a florida clam farmer, thank you for your service
YouTube link 2dU_uqMZNU4 please do not ask me on how i stumbled across this video, but i think it’s fitting
Imagine if he went to all the compass locations as well lmfao
Do every McDonald’s next
this showed up in  my recommended and i out loud said "eddy, NO"
Yes!  My summer is made.  Thank you Eddy and Ted
the sequel is always better than the original, good job eddy
Superb editing
I was literally thinking about when we'd see a new eddy video 24 hours ago. I'm so excited for this! Thanks man!! 🖤💜🖤💜
no… not again…
The lyrics to the song Margaritaville are now so much sadder now that it's a brick and mortar empire
This wasn't the content I asked for, but it's the content I deserve
early
This is the most wonderful feeling of deja vu
I love how you're just blatantly broadcasting the fact that you're a HUGE masochist once more
I have a core memory of eating at the Margaritaville in Orlando when I was 10. It was the worst burger I’ve ever had in my life
Eddy burback goes down every mcdonalds playplace slide in us and canada
OH GOD WHYYYYYY
it’s good to know eddy still loves his job
before i watch the video i'm betting $10 he does not have a single margarita
GO EDDY GO!
Legend says that the last man to do this challenge could not figure out when 5 pm was ever again
I found your channel through the Rainforest Cafe video!! Now caught this one upon uploading. Full cicle moment!
Hard Rock Cafe next year?
Now eat at every McDonald’s in the us:)
It’s 2034. Eddy has just released a video of himself eating at every McDonalds in North America. The video is 26 hours long, the trip took 37 months, and it could’ve all been avoided, had Eddy said no to Ted, all those years ago.
This man is the modern odyssey
i audibly said “no eddy….” as i clicked on the video bc of his pain from last time
I thought I saw y’all in Destin 😂
he did it, that crazy son of a bitch did it
I’ve been to one margaritaville, in Atlanta, and halfway through the meal one of the workers came out to the deck where we were and announced “hey someone’s car is being broken into by a homeless man and there’s a gun in the car so you might want to go deal with that”
I can't believe it. I'm so excited
"Punishing my intestines and mental faculties once simply wasn't enough. My liver must also be made to suffer."
NO FUCKING WAY
YESSSS
I'd like to live all my life in Margaritaville
YEEEEESSSS SEQUEL OF THE CENTURY
Been waiting patiently on the next time you'd be doing this
LFG SYRACUSE MENTIONED!!!! DESTINY USA!!!!
I was about to make a comment about what the people at Buc-ee’s must have been thinking but then I remembered they’re in a Texas gas station so that was probably the most normal thing happening there
Why are you doing this to yourself?
The sequel we didn’t know we needed
Next year: I ate at every Hard Rock Cafe in the World
*Finished watching the Rainforest Cafe video*  Me: That was a great video. Glad I rewatched it. Time to see what else I can watch on Eddy's channel.  *17 minutes ago "I ate at every Margaritaville in the Country*  Me: A Margaritaville video? What a coincidence that I just finished the Rainforest video!
wtf I watched the rainforest cafe video at 2 am today before I went to bed and now this happens? am I magic?
so i am guessing next year they will hit up all of Dolly's stuff
The sequel we never knew we needed.
Eddy No! Why would you do this to yourself again?
MY FAVORITE GENRE OF VIDEO!!! EDDY TORTURE TOUR!! ALL ABOARD
jimmy would be proud
Next time, every McDonalds in the country
Never clicked on a video so fast before.
oh we're so back
LET'S GO!
Eddy 9 Pins strikes again... Metaphorically, of course.
Eddy is the goat 🐐!!
personally, my favorite summer tradition is knowing eddie is torturing himself by going to multiple b-list restaurants under the same name around the country with ted nivison
You have a strong will to be able to do this again, but it did give us an amazing video. Hope you're having a good day Eddy
Awesome
another banger, another banger by eddy from yikes shop
the things you do for content… thank you for ur sacrifices 🫡
I saw the thumbnail and involuntarily said out loud "Eddy, no..."
Fire alarm going off at 3am was bad but now I’m up at 4am for Eddy video
It's about time.
i have already sent this video to my brother in law before even watching it, love love love your content eddie ❤ way to commit to the bit
Eddy no stop youre hurting yourself
the moment I saw him post I literally wetted my trousers
IT’S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE
So *THIS* is what Eddy was doing this entire time
Idk if the demons souls intro-esque music for the intro was on purpose but I love it
Can't wait for next year's "I Went To Every Medieval Times In The Country"
I cannot believe he struck gold twice
why did he do it
Can we rename the video to be about the thing
Alternative video title: Jimmy Buffett is the Destroyer of Worlds
my god he's done it again
wooooo!
NEW VIDEO NEW VIDEO
Eddy why would you do that, margaritaville at the mall of America is right next to your least favorite rainforest cafe
HE DID IT AGAIN
As an Arizonan I love seeing someone else as confused about "The Thing" signs as I always was growing up
Next year is bubba gump shrimp
I have been WAITING for THIS
I had my 14th birthday party at the Margaritaville in Biloxi. I really hope Eddy brings that up in the video because that is a crucial detail about the restaurant.  EDIT: Eddy pronounces Biloxi very wrong lol
idk how eddy always one ups himself. any time i see a younger eddy even just by a year i say wow he got more handsome! how does he do it!
ive been to the "The Thing?" museum, it is a true eighth wonder of the world. i had a full conversation with the alien on the dinosaur, nice guy!
Again?
Ok gang. Looks like this has the potential to be a series. So....  What chain does our all-powerful, super handsome Eddy need to patron next?  I vote Quiznos.
I saw this video in my recommendations and I immediately said out loud “Oh, not again.”
Now go to every Pina Coladaburg
"Eating at every _____" is an annual tradition on this channel now lets go
i love it when the sequel does callbacks to small things from the original
Do every McDonalds next, cant take that much longer
Where can I pay to see those feet?
The legend did it AGAIN!
Dear lord yes, another one of these
Never smashed play on a video faster
I'm looking forward to the "I ate at every McDonald's in the Country" video
Poggers vid Eddy. I can't wait for you and Ted to hit up every Dave and Busters in 2024.
This has to be some kind of self punishment at this point
This means you were right next door to me at one point! I shoulda noticed that stache!!
Why on earth would you rent a pickup truck for a 9000 mile road trip???
Me and my friends went to Margaritaville in Chicago, and we all got food poisoning as well 😂
Super hyped for Eddy’s next video “I ate at every McDonald’s in the world”
I thought the title said COUNTY and thought wow you really spread this into an hour, huh. Oh it makes sense now 😂
Save him he’s WASTING AWAY AGAIN
We’re back at it again
This is my joker
A masterpiece
what would Jimmy Buffett do
"Think of Jimmy Buffett less as a musician" Way ahead of you 👍
Ok now complete the trilogy by going to every Chuck E. Cheese.
Ronald gladden approves
Why
What a treat this video is!!!!
shoutout to eddy for giving himself tummy aches for our benefit
don't you just love these type of videos where its basically just youtubers saying "Hey guys im rich and i can do this and buy this and go here and you can't and it cost me this much..." such great content!
My experience of Margaritavilles are that they are often on the same block as a Rainforest Cafe
Eddy sacrificing his mental stability for our entertainment. Bless you, sir.
oh... my... god... I never thought we'd see Edward Burback at it again, but here we are. I can only hope to go on a fraction of the journey that he went on by watching this video. Thank you Edwin Burback.
Next he’s gonna go to every Subway in the country
under 15 minute GANG
Upset that you didn’t go to the one in the Cancun Airport. 0/10 video. I’m ashamed.
This man is keeping mid tier themed chain restaurants in operation
now do mcdonalds coward
I can’t believe you bc put yourself through this again 😭😭
The long awaited sequel
This cured my depression!
Eddy why!! Not again!
oh no Eddy, your poor colon
thanks for this, abt to kill the next hour of my 6 hr drive
My immediate verbal response to the title alone, "Oh, Eddy..." xD
my god, he did it again
But why
You really like to torture yourself with those trips
This can only end with Ted and eddy eating at every McDonald’s
you guys had a chance to not drive a pickup truck on cross country tour and you didn’t take it 😂😂
I remember going to the margaritaville in MOA as a kid and being really grossed out cause i accidentally touched some old gum under the table
Next is all McDonald’s in America and canada
Literally just finished watching the rainforest cafe one like as I got the notification the video ended
why
I didn't know I needed this until I saw it on my feed. I could not be happier in this moment
another
Eddy not 😮
when he had the chance to do something crazier, he did
Still not enough jimmy buffet
Eddy I found you due to the Rainforest Cafe video, and this is the follow up video I didn't know I needed but I'm glad we have.
i've watched literally 2 seconds of the video. No you did not Eddy.
Why?
Another banger
I was in Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and there was a margaritaville sadly I didn’t go.
eddie you made my parents go to the rain forest cafe twice in a row in a day. please dont make it part 2 with margaritaville.
Just when you thought it couldn't get any better. He comes out with a sequel.
Madman
Eddy is carrying the gimmicky chain restaurant industry. Truly an unsung hero
No one asked for this. Yet here we are.
HE HATH RETURNED TO HIS HOLY CRUSADE!
Eddy gets tired of going to the Mall of America series pt 2
He really has a Peter Parker sounding voice
Philadelphia
How does your innards survive such torture?
wow, i never knew the other guy from tonys channel had a youtube channel
This is the perfect episode to watch when I’m visiting every Margaritaville in the country
To say I'm ecstatic is an understatement
You crazy son of a bitch, you’ve done it again.
eddy noo
You are going to die from doing these videos once a year
Eddy has been taken in by buffetmania. A true parrot head. Rest in salt-rimmed peace
now why were those aliens so caked up
I fucking love you Eddy keep up the amazing work
STARTS GROWLING AND ROLLING ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE A LITTLE PIGGY IN MUD YAHOO YAHOO NEW EDDY UPLOAD
I love these road trip videos! Can't wait for Ted's to come out!
the next restaurant chain he should do is mcdonald’s… i think he would actually die before even leaving california
FIRST
❤
Eddy's really making a great case for himself as a future hall of fame feaster. S-tier feasting right here.
the king is back
BOY HE DID IT AGAIN
we are so fucking back
THE KING RETURNS WITH MORE SELF-TORTURE.
This reminds me of the time Eddy went to every Rainforest Cafe
My boss is absolutely OBSESSED with Jimmy Buffett so I will absolutely be showing her this video
Noooooooo Eddy nooo whyyyyy
not again oh no
finally a sequel to one of the greatest videos ever posted on this website
Is this how Eddy is transitioning into a travel vlog YouTuber
“I ate at every McDonald’s in the country”
by god i didn't expect a sequel, but we're here
I’m scared by the power this man holds over the restaurant industry
DR JAMES????????
Already know, I hit like before I even watched the video.
I’m sure they are long gone by now, but is there any way at all to get the twitch vods of y’all playing KH2? Those streams got me through one of the toughest times in my life. I rewatched them every single day until Twitch deleted them.
My tummy hurts but I’m being brave about it
Eddy 9 pins is back at it again
The sequel nobody expected but everybody wanted
Eddy you mad man
I hope you're ok edward burback...
the “final” time
Make me a hurricane before I go insane...
maragaritaville? more like margar-EDDY-ville!
eddy no why would you do this to yourself again
🎉
the worlds greatest youtube video finally has a sequel
🎉🎉🎉🎉
The title of this video sounds like a confessional…
The Vivaldi adding so much suspense and mystique 👌
Finally, a speedrun for divorced Dads!
I guarantee he is going to go insane this year
boost
Part 1: I Ate at Every Rainforest Café in North America; Part 2: I Ate at Every Margaritaville in the Country Just a solid two hours of solid content lol
Goddamnit Eddy you gotta stop doing this to yourself
I feel like I am have been able to reach moderate success by “out training my diet” as I plateau I make those changes to my diet as needed
just clicked on the video and gave it a like. already know this will be a burback classic
🎶 I would like to live all my life in Margaritaville🎵
Why isn’t margaritaville a buffet style restaurant? The opportunity has been squandered
I watch your rainforest cafe video a lot, because for some unearthly reason it calms me when I’m feeling anxious. I’m really happy you made this video ❤
Thank you Edward this was very eye opening.
I know a waitress who works at the Bossier, La one. I wonder if she’ll make an appearance in the vid! EDIT; THIS VID IS A FARCE! YOU DIDNT EVEN GO TO THE ONE I MENTIONED IM SO UPSET IM SHAKING
Eddy Burback at it again! Torturing himself by going on a road trip for content!
ever notice how he keeps following some blonde woman?? kinda creepy eddy!!does chrissy know???
I love that the success of the rainforest cafe video broke him down enough to do it again
Eddy why do you keep doing this to yourself
Aw shit, here we go again.
i'm thankful that eddie was able to experience the full grace and splendour of our lord Jimmy Buffet
who made you like this?
The sequel we never knew we needed.
How eat at every Dinasaur cafe
HE DID IT AGAIN GUYS HE DID IT AGAIN
The only time I’ve been to a margaritaville, I was at the Nashville one coming down from shrooms. The shrimp was so salty I almost threw up. 9/10 experience
If there isn't a Buffett buffet, I am going to be very disappointed.
ah yes, another country-wide descent into madness with Eddy. splendid :)
oh its the guy who tried to trademark a common phrase because he has no ideas of his own
AINT NO WAY
this is about to be the best video im ever going to see
This is dumb. This is stupid. But I love you so I'll let it slide ❤
eddy you are permanently changing my brain chemistry
I audibly yelled "NO" when I saw this thumbnail
and so it begins, the yearly tradition.
The things the man does this lower intestine just to get views. Such commendable dedication.
ok now do it with cracker barrel
eddie will mildly enjoy the first couple of times and then feel a deep sense of dread after about 8 days of being on the road. Looking forward to it.
Oh boy! We just finished the rainforest cafe one, so this will be a hoot
Oh Eddy.. not again... are you kidnapped?
why does he do this to himself
Eddy no
i literally cried out to the heavens no eddy why when i saw this videos title
The sequel for MEN
The man has once again suffered for us at a chain restaurant only grandmas frequent. Well done sir!   Maybe TGIFRIDAYS should be your next adventure lol
I, quite literally, fall asleep to the rain forest cafe video every single night (alternating between yours and teds). that video has sort of become my religion. so when i saw this title i audibly screamed "no you didnt." there is a new god in town
I say you should go to every McDonald's in the country now
Eddy why do you like Suffering
I’ve been to the one in Mississippi
Devastated you came to Cleveland and didn't do a meet & greet lmaoooo
Oh Jesus Christ Eddy
Love the use of Vivaldi in this
bazinga!
Jimmyyyyyy ❤ I love Jimmy so much
I see you as well are a fan of classical music that goes hard
SLAY EDDIE
The sequel we needed and deserved.
How has this man not been sponsored by HelloFresh yet? If only to offset what he's putting him body through for our edutainment.
I feel like I have been waiting for this my whole life
I don’t know why but this video feels slightly familiar. As if I’ve watched it before but now it’s like a different restaurant.
YES
What a madlad.
sorry I missed ya in Tulsa Eddy </3
Eddy you didn’t have to do this to yourself
Oh no
eddy been lookin jacked lately
Mad lad just can't get enough of his niche themed restaurant chains
you’re so brave 🫡
If you don't know who Jimmy Buffett is, congratulations you had a stable childhood
If I had a nickel for every time Eddy Burback traveled the country eating from one restaurant chain, I'd have two nickels, which is not a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice
The dynamic duo returns
Eddy is physically incapable of eating without making direct eye contact with a parrot and you cant change my mind
This reminds me of that time where some guy ate at every rainforest cafe in the world. I miss that guy i wonder what happened to him…
not again you bastard
Not again
Letttttssssss gooooo!!!!!!!
Eddy no, not again
Very impressive, Eddy. Thank you for sharing
I can’t wait for Ted’s POV to come out in like 3 months.
when people talk about the travel & tourism industry coming back after covid i assume this is what they mean
Couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw this notification
Never been to a Margaritaville but now I feel like I have to go
why?
I am very disappointed (Edit: nevermind he talked about pigeon forge positively[holy cow he went on the island Ferris wheel])
Once more into the fray of themed restaurants that eddie will mildly enjoy the first couple of times and then feel a deep sense of dread after about 8 days of being on the road. Looking forward to it.
he’s like a vanilla version of wendigoon
New video 😍
MOM WAKE UP THE FUNNY MUSTACHE MAN DID IT AGAIN
Still rewatching the rainforest one over and over. And now this! Thank you!
But is teds truck okay?
“How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!”
Barbenheimerateverymagaritavilleinthecountry time!
But why?
eddy brings himself to the brink of insanity for content once again
It's all fun and games until Eddy decides to go to every Waffle House in the U.S.  Edit: Rest in peace Jimmy 🤍🦜
Eddy is a glutton for punishment and over priced, overly themed restaurants
THE UNEXPECTED SEQUEL. Now for his FINAL act he will eat at every McDonalds in the US.
Have you learned nothing from the Rainforest Cafe, Eddy?
And my boy Danny G is in it.
you scare me
I can't beleive this. I just rewatched rainforest cafe this morning
Here we go again....
Is this guy really going to every Margaritaville in the country?
The madlad has done it again
Bro didn't learn his lesson 🤦🏿‍♂️
Why did you do this to yourself? Again!
Next video is going to every Chuck E. Cheese
Oh boy, time to watch Eddy have another themed-chain-restaurant-induced mental breakdown for the sake of our entertainment!
Hi Ed
WASTED AWAY IN MARGARITAVILLE!!
you did not do this again😭
Hey I saw you the other day down at LA, I was too scared to say hi though 💀
hi ed
“Wow that Rainforest Cafe video is crazy, I can imagine anyone doing anything like that again… right?”  *Rainforest Cafe 2: Electric Boogaloo*
Is eddy just going to keep doing videos like this till he eats at every restaurant in us? If so I’m 100% here for it.
You look like a depressed version of the Inside Out dad.
absolutely  Huge
I was completely convinced this was a repeat upload and now I’m overwhelmed with excitement.
Eddy is slowly conquering all the funny little restaurants!
the mad lad did it again
Who else is ready to watch Eddy lose his sanity again?
Already finished the video (10x speed). 8.5/10
getting so much deja vu from the opening of this video
Love these videos dude!
Eddy is the restaurant man
No Eddy, no you did not. We’ve been trying to tell you, Margaritaville doesn’t exist, you made it up, you’re still in the rainforest cafe
I love the videos, but why do you keep doing this to yourself?
its insane to think its already been over a year since the rainforest café video. feels like it released just last week
EDDY NO (But also I’ve rewatched the Rainforest Cafe vid like 10 times so I’m excited to have a new one)
YESSSSS W VIDEO
Another one!
Eddy... please blink twice if you're okay.
amazing video, nice mustache
EDDY NO
We're back babyyyy
He’s done it again
Who is THIS guy?
i audibly just went “no he didn’t……”
eddy i’m like 90% sure doing stuff like this is what’s going to kill you.

Well, I know what I'm doing for the next hour.

Eddy nobody made you do this twice. But im glad you did, this is what it means to be human
eddy is single-handedly saving the niche chain restaurant industry
Do casa bonita next
There are definitely margaritaville coffins and you should be buried in one.
some people claim that there’s a woman to blame  but I know it’s Eddy Burback
he's back!
Well, I know what I'm doing for the next hour.
Eddy’s wasting away again…
What's your health insurance rate look like?
MARGARITAVILLE MY FAVORITE PLACE IN THE WORLD!!
I love the rainforest cafe video so it’s awesome to see a follow up
I was so sad when the Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant near me closed, so this is lovely to see
