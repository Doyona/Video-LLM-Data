Stop bashing on diet coke 😡
Ralfs has the fruty yaste your saying
noooooooooooOooooOOOOOOOOO
2:27 "freakpat isn't real, he can't hurt you"  Freakpat:
It would have been funny if harris Teeter went against diet coke in the first round and diet coke got immediately eliminated.
Coke
Helllo past internet. This is me four years later, I used to not drink diet and now I do. My favorite off brand diet drink is the zero cola and I was drinking it today and it hit me that it was Matt’s favorite for this video as well.
Only ogs will remember MatPat-s obsession with diet Coke
Go heels
Glass coke
I'm from the Missouri and I've never heard pop except on YouTube, soda always
Only ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke.
Why does Matt look fake, or uncanny valley?
Only ogs remember MatPat's obsession with diet coke
Of course Coca Cola had to change because it had c*cai*e
Soda Pop or D
i say soda
Kroger has my favorite soda too. Their generic of Dr Pepper (Dr. K) is better than Dr. Pepper for me. I remember liking Food Lion's generic as well, but I moved away from the place I lived that had a Food Lion.
very good
Our grocery here have something call RC Cola. we stat that RC stat for "restant de coke" which would mean like the flat end of old bottle, bottle up in that brand.
Diet Sam’s is pretty much the same as coke, I’ve had it many times as my dad lost his job.
This is scientific enough for me lol. Wish that winner was available worldwide.
21:00 She was shocked to see him cheat on this love
I love Coke Zero too!
Man they did Boylan dirty
Everything i know about MatPat: Fnaf, loves diet coke, red jacket, sans = ness, fnaf movie waiter, has 4 chanels, sadly retired
Drink harboe
Only OGs remember MatPats Diet Coke obsession
In malta, we call it soft drinks
15:26 That’s so me 😂
i love eating soda cans
15:22 not even a coke product lol
Haven't watched food theory in forever intro is still fire
chesse
No Dr. Pepper???????
Only ogs remember matpat’s obsession with diet coke
Wait, food lion only in NC? I live in raleigh and just always assumed it was a big nationwide brand😂
I remember watching this like 4 minutes after it was release dam its been a long time
Zevia is sweet tulasi,???? Who in their right mind would make a tulasi coca cola???it freshens yiur breath, it's closer to mouthwash than to a cola drink 😣
We in England say drink or fizzy drink so you’d go “can i have a drink” “what one” “coke” so kinda like coke (yes i know im responding to a 4 year old video)
When i found this video I was literally drinking Diet Coke and didn’t realize it until 7 minutes into the video 😂😂
I’m pop all the way
Ya know, Diet sodas contain fake sugars which aren't any better for you than real sugars. So why compromise on taste by drinking diet soda if it isn't any better for you?
B!
Also, for middle schoolers, atleast here in Missouri, we have March Mammal Madness
My addiction is Dr Pepper XD
recommendations strikes again counter: 4
I say soda
Cooldrink me

I can't believe it's been 5 years
I JUST SIMULTAINEOSLY WHIPPED AND NAYNAYED
✅pop🚫coke
In india we call it drink
TOASTY
I’ve grown to like Diet Coke a lot more recently. I’d say it’s my second favourite behind Dr Pepper 🥤 There’s something about it that’s very refreshing when you’re thirsty ❤️
We call it soda or Coke here, but since we are from India, that's the terminology we use.
My man drink water
18:56 this is what happens when two very intelligent people have a debate
It's a state specific store but HEB has a VERY good diet coke
😆that rock paper scissors part reminds me of the one regular show episode where they keep playing the same thing over and over and over
Alabama it’s a 50-50 between pop and soda
12:21 bizarre? 🐎🧑🏼‍🦽‍➡️⚽️🌎
I honestly grew up on diet dr pepper and diet coke. But once we stopped seeing them for cheap and I had my own steady income in college I found i enjoyed food lions  diet cola enough that with the price difference it was better to get. As a person with perdiem during work I still will get an occasional diet coke, Pepsi, or dr pepper but my daily brand is foodlion diet cola
NOOOOO DIET COKE KING PLEASE STAY ADDICTED TO IT😭
I call it all soda
i love how he doesnt sugarcoat his words
Team soda
My advice:  Get a carbonater.  It adds carbonation to water in an incredibly cost effective manner.  For flavor, add just a little bit of PURE grape juices (CHECK THE INGREDIENTS.  Not all juice is really juice!) Lemon and lime juice concentrate work too, as do whole limes or lemons that have been sliced in half.  This way you aren't getting any "natural flavors", "flavors", zero sugar substitutes (even the relatively benign Stevia is icky if you use too much), preservatives, addictive substances (aspartame, sucrose, sucralate, sucr-whateter), or refined/concentrated sugars (fructose, glucose, etc.)  When I quit diet cola, it took me over a month before the headaches stop, and I continue to have cravings to this day.  If that's not a sign of addiction, I don't know what is.  I felt like couldn't sleep or work without soda.  It was not healthy for my mind or body.  For anyone who thinks they aren't addicted (and this goes for ANY  potential addiction):  Try to quit and see what symptoms you get.
He infact relapsed and is still addicted
From Maryland and food lion and Harris teater are huge here
i call it soda I GOT IN A FIGHT ON A GAME CUZ I CALLED IT SODA ONECE
I’m drinking Diet Coke right now
Fun fact Pepsi was originally made in North Carolina
POP
Intense
14:38 I go to food lion all the time lol
2:15 kinda ironic considering duke is always in the tournament
When I saw this video”NOOOOOO”
in the uk we just say the name of the drinks its just fanta coke pepsi ect
I think it's incredible as a wrestling fan that MatPat changed the March Madness to Matness, which is what the NCAA wrestling championship is called. I just rewatched and it popped out at me.
10:16 whenever i hear matpat say "steph & i" i hear a weirdly pronounced "stephany"
I’m from Utah and we called it soda pop lol
So we're only doing the top 3 teams players and not even going to try and argue for the other teams? This has got to be the most Biased pro teams in a long while
When was the last time you moderated an ad
Pop
I dont live near a harris teeter but since this video came out its been on the back of my mind. Today while passing through North Carolina while on vacation I finally got to stop at a Harris Teeter and buy their store brand cola. I got both regular and diet and I gotta say it surpassed my expectations of it. Genuinely my new favorite soda, I absolutely love that fruity flavor on the back end of the diet one. The closest thing I can compare it to was starlight coke back when that was a thing. I highly recommend it to anyone passing through!
Matt, you should actually try to Dr Pepper. You will not regret it.
Steph throws up gang signs 20:24
15:27 I call it cola
13:53 did you see the rules
15:33 I Call It Just “Soft Drinks”
Team soda here👇
Lived in the Alabama all my life and no one ever said the coke thing. They ask what do you want to drink and you tell them what you want.
Shasta got shasted
That rock paper scissors game proved that their ment to be
Do you wanna know what else he quit cries*
Are you a mormon? lol
MatPat: I quit Diet Coke    Coca-Cola company: guys we have a problem our sales have gone down let’s look up the channels. Make sure Matt still drinking it.😂
I saw this video right after giving up Diet Coke. It helped so much lol tbh
Salisbury NC where I am from is where Food Lion, Pepsi, and Cheerwine originated!
Pop
Biggest clickbait of YouTube
I also grew up in the mid west so I grew up saying pop and if you said soda pop you were mental ill
My local grocery store's ginger ale is actually really nice. Very sharp and the bubbles are nice.
I call it by its name
Resurrecting this ancient video to say Coke Zero was perfect. The reformulation to Coke Zero Sugar was a travesty.
It's weird hearing MatPat saying you probably never heard of food lion because i go there almost every week for grocery's
bolth
We call it fizz here. 🙂 There's a reason that bars & pubs here sell cola with ice & a slice (lemon) in an actual glass.
Soda

15:32 we used to call our grandpa 'pop' because he always had like, 20 cans of soda when we visited, and yes, i am a pop kid.
why am i getting recommended this in 2025?
God this was awful
only ogs will remember matpats obsession with diet coke
Diet Coke no hmm try diet dr Pepper
food lion? we used to have  one close to us in Kentucky a decade ago. Hadn't seen one since.
The moment when HT’s citric acid is highlighted as the “flavor oomph”… when Diet Coke also has it :p
I tell my wife constantly that Kroger brand stuff is superior most of the time. I buy store brand across the board for no other reason than I'm a cheapskate. But if you truly want the best quality, Kroger brand rarely disappoints.
E. All of the Above
Sugary Carbonated Fluid
other. Soda pop
If u guys think that May forgot about Harris teatter he had been drink some  in videos and probably drinks it off camera
i like that store brands are in the netherlands where i live cheaper and way more tasty compared to coca cola and pepsi here
I was born in Illinois, so I used to say pop. But then I moved to Texas and Arizona  and started saying soda even though I moved back home to the Midwest recently I still say soda and never say pop as I’m used to saying soda for so many years
The only soda i can differentiate is McDonald's sprite. It js hits different than a can or a bottle
Splenda is bad for you.
episode 2: root beer
I’m watching this like four years later during March madness p
How dare you call me chaotic mat
Steph is just too gorgeous, it takes away from the importance of this video! But choosing Coke ZERO? Dead to me.
Fountain is actually around 1 cal if you don't have I've they make it a bit more syrup forward to reduce dilution effect
Better than sugar
I LOVE Diet Coke!!!!!
Sigh, looks at my 10 cans of Zevia in my room
watching this a few days before march madness starts
I’m not really a Soda Gal, I’m more of a Water, Lemonade, Gatorade, Milkshake Gal.
Soda through and through.
It's the name of what u want in the UK eg fanta

Yo they completely doxed themselves lol
Personally i think it would have been cooler if they didnt know which drink they had drunk until the end of the video
2:28 did not age well with today’s freaky memes 🤣🤣
I'm watching this while drinking coke😭
Fizzy drink cuz I'm a brit
16:40 true the best soda I’ve ever had was Price Chopper ginger ale
Soda (as you call it) has no nutritional value, and only has negative effects on the body, so it is poison.
Only true ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke
i used to call it cold drinks or sometimes even soft drinks back when i was 7 or 8 but every since that time i use the term "soda" 😂
Goodbye matpat 😢
39K
18:26  True love!
In Australia we call it a soft drink or a fizzy drink or a can a'
coke zero
I haven't drank fizzy juice by itself,as I drink it when I'm boozing, for about 4 to 5 years now and I don't miss it at all
This is inpossble😢
NOOOOO
I like Pepsis more I LOVEEE CHERRY PEPSISSSSSS!!!!!
2025? Anyone? 👇🏻
I use D (fizz)
4:40 Glass bottle is best 12:55 I can’t do diet drinks, I HATE the aspartame flavor, and I’m also not a fan of stevia. Aspartame is worse though
I call my soft drinks fizzy
Agreed!! I'm a huge Brand Diet Coke drinker BUT Harris Teeter's Diet Coke is amazing and I have both 2 liters at the house.  Well done.
Me three years ago looking at the thumb nail no no this can't be
Diet Coke to me is terrible I Rick with the Coke Zero

I am so happy the underdog won. This shows you realy did your best in beeing objective. Hopefully your body keeps beeing healthy. 1:31 Your "Do as I say and not as I do" quote could save, onkly if it works, save every parent from bad influencing their kids if the parent does a mistake.  Except you're flawless of course.
MatPat will always be someone I admire.
As a fellow North Carolinian I was rooting for Harris Teeter so hard 😂
depends who im around usually i say pop. If im around friends i lean towards soda but i slip to pop so much that ive converted some friends to pop.
Diet sams cola
Yooooooo m live next to a Harris Teeter
I completely accidently paused it right at 21:49 when he was doing the MR BEEEAAAAST pose LOL
POV Harris teeter:I have grown from a man to a god!
I'm from Vancouver in Canada and it is pop
I love Harris teeter :3
The reason MatPat couldn’t find Diet Coke Splenda is because they started to discontinue it in 2020; in my opinion that was Coke’s worst mistake because I actively avoid aspartame because of how bad it is for you and how bad it tastes
C
My go to is diet sam’s I started buying it last year because it’s so cheap but now I prefer it
Dr Pepper’s better sorry mat
TRY KINZA ITS SO GOOD
The fact that they both strongly consider North Carolina as “the south” concerns me
Is pepsi max available in where you at because I think you would enjoy it it's one of the biggest soda's in UK (don't know if it's the pepsi zero sugar where u at)
The amount of mistakes in mat saying the ranks of the soda just makes this video better
I’m soda
PUBLIX ISNT NATIONWIDE?
Fake account
I’m exactly the same like Matt except I like regular Coke
I LOVE tournaments so this was always going to be an all time favorite episode across all the channels.
I say sugary drink that could give me diabetes to the store worker
Which sodas are abit more healthy to drink diet or zero sugar/ calories sodas

How did I get hear from "at least our schools don't look like fortnite battle royale"
Soda pop😅
15:30 in some european countries we call all of the sodas, cokes and other sweet drinks - lemonades (not the lemon or lime flavour). In Lithuania lemonade is just a soft drink like coca cola, gingerale, sprite, fanta and others.
Dang it been years layers it is a og thing
I call it soda or fizzy drinks or sparkling water
who's unfortuned soul needed to wash the cups after every cut if you dont wash the cup the flavor will combine together
We call it soft drink
Food lion is also in Tn

Still none of them so I will continue with diet Coke
They technically all tied for second Diet coke was both of your second picks Harris teeter and Coke Zero both got first and third which evens out to second for both
I just call it a fizzy drink
Only og's will remember MatPat's obsession with Diet Coke
8:40 their birch beer is great and the cherry one is good but i haven't tried the diet cola
18:04 MATPAT YOU SAID “13th” instead of “10th” 🤯🤯🤯
This is still my favorite Food Theory video :D
Aspartame in Coke causes cancer and dementia. Google it.
Matpat after this: Diet Coke go in my mouth now. No Harris teeter for no reason.

Who remembers matpats coke addiction? Also who's here in 2024?
Is it strange that I live in Maryland, yet there is a Harris teeter and a food lion 5 to 3 mins away from my house?
"Wait, you guys cawwl it SOWWWDAA, instead of Bubbla Twista Snapple Crackle Poplle CReAms? That's a bit weird innit?"
my grandma drinks lots of diet coke - and she tried diet rite for a few weeks. lets say one random day she switched back to regular diet coke. it was good soda, i had some of her diet rite cans too.
Soda
Yooooo that’s why Diet Coke and lime is so good
Matpat resigning 3 years after diet coke ☹️
Something funny, I love Cherry Cola, but for a while I was going with the "Big K" Cherry cola cause it was cheaper, And they taste quite similar I noticed, though after a while The Kroger Cola started tasting bad from me having it so often that I do prefer Name Brand Cherry Cola Now, In which is Cherry Coca Cola
fun fact, three years late, soda from a 2 liter bottle tastes different from soda from a 20oz bottle
A chance that barely happened… a different choice, NOT Diet Coke…
I would like to see Food Theory make a diet Cola from scratch  But use Allulose and a pinch of monk fruit Sweeteners
im fizifaz
As some one in South Carolina  good lion is here too
i do know of food lion before this vid
19:08 Since no one can decide, and all that’s played is tied 6 times, I take it upon myself to drink your prize.
I call it alcohol for kids (This is a joke about how kids can get addicted to soda, I actually just call it soda)
dr pepper😊
soft drink
Soda pop
In South Africa we don't call it either of the things listed, we call it 'Cooldrink(s)'
You missed Pepsi Max zero sugar

I'm a bit late to answer the question  But here in my home country of egypt we call it pepsi, no matter the kind  My friend would say "I got a Pepsi" and I would ask "what kind?" And for example he would say "mountain dew"

Matt: rambling about why harris teeter should win Steph:😮

Idk why MatPat said Food Lion was NC based; it’s in Tennessee too.

I’m not a Diet Coke fan, but I do love a Harris Teeter Diet Cola. Live right by one here in Charleston, SC. Also, I’ve lived in the south exclusively for 24 years and have never heard the coke thing that Steph was talking about. Always heard it as soda. 😂

I don't have any nearby Kroger grocery stores, but the Food Lion has the same packaging as Price Chopper
I will call Soda or pop. it is good idea try different drinks. Good work on the video.
D
As someone who has randomly grabbed a boylan cherry soda to try, their other sodas are not good either ☠️
As a Coca Cola addict myself, I had to watch this. Personally, I dislike fountain drink Coke because around here they add too much water to it. Canned, I can taste the metal. I like Coke over Pepsi because it's richer. Pepsi just tastes like sugar. No offense intended to the Pepsi lovers, but one glass of Pepsi will hurt my stomach versus I could drink a 2 liter of Coke myself before I get a stomach ache  Most of those brands I never heard of, but I imagine products will be different in different states
Shasta, Publix, Food Lion...hittin' me in the nostalgia feels, Matt.
I say soda
Coke
I call it soft drink
I’m in the Northeast, I say soda.
I call them colas
I sometimes say "carbonated beverage" out of pure spite lol
Ik it’s been 3 yrs but here in Australia I call it Soda or mainly soft drink
soda
15:30  I am D I call it umm well soft drink
I got a Ralph’s ad after this video 😭😭
Nah, I live down in the south, and I call it Coke (mostly cuz I thought all sodas were just cokes), but now I know they're different.        I still call it all Coke 💀
Water……
Make a citrus acid krabby patty... secret formula found
Delaware guy here. We have Food Lions here. What we don't have are Costco. I wish we had one since everyone that mentions it in conversation since its praises, but we don't.
He didn’t just quit diet coke he quit youtube💀💀💀
It's soda here in the Golden state
I don't think y'all like cane sugar.
In belguim food lion is called dalhais (im not sure how to write it tho)
Pop
Green Cola for me is the absolute KING of diet sodas. It's a Greek soda with stevia instead of sugar. It is amazing and it's a pity that it's rare in the US.
I’ve always really liked Kroger brand Diet Cola. I think Diet Coke has a special place in my heart but I usually opt for the store brand to save money.
I’m “soda” and “soft drink”🥤🍾🥤🍺🍻🥤🍾🥤
me having like 5 food lions being in a 45 minute vicinity 🧍‍♀️  nope never heard of it
me when i’m from va and have foodlion and harris teeter 🧍‍♀️
I can’t believe Steph didn’t know that Florida was a part of the south I’m here in Florida. We have Publix.😂😅
19:27 Matt pretending not to know at all... 9:36 (With the most confident face ever) "It's diet coke" That made me laugh SO hard
In Ireland we usually call them fizzy drinks and back when I was young ( a long time ago) they were called "minerals" in the countryside ( not usually in Dublin)
That's it, the secret ingredient in the Crabby Patty formula is.......citric acid !
A
“Are you soda, pop or coke” Me-“..soft drinks”
Soft drink
they shouldve used glasses that werent transparent, with lids, in addition to the non transparent straws for this kind of experiment. the visual bias is not negatable by just doing your 'best to stay impartial'. our eyes can pull some crazy tricks on us
We call it fizzy in Arizona
Soda
In netherland we call it cola... i don't understand calling it coke cuz isn't that the brand?😅
A: POP
In louisiana, we say what kinda coke you want?
Pop al the way
2 years later, now that MatPat has retired, I can safely say that while I love most all Food Theories...this one is probably my favorite. It's just really fun as someone who has watched Mat for almost his entire time on the platform and knows how much he loves Diet Coke to see him find a new favorite soda. 😊
15:29 personally im more of an other fan
I get Kroger branded cola zero sugar, and like it a lot. It's definitely not a coke zero or diet coke, but it's good and even a bit different than getting straight coke zero every time.
A: pop
Did Matthew ever check out caffeine-free diet Coke when he was going caffeine-free?
You know they drink too much soda when they can tell the difference
I remember Food Lion from watching The MDA Labor Day Telethon (previously known as TheJerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon) when I was a kid.
When I first watched this I saw the “I quit” and freaked. That aged well🥲
Surprised not to see RC cola anywhere
I've lived here my ENTIRE life, and never knew Harris Teeter and Food Lion was just an NC thing.
can't believe he's done
Did he really drink warm diet drinks to get a realistic flavor? Even diet Pepsi tastes completely diff cold vs warm
Coke zero
15:30 Fizzy
I live close to NC. Now I want to try Harris Teeter soda. I don't like diet soda but if it's as good as Mat and Steph say...I'm willing to try. Thanks for the future vacation mini roadtrip idea guys!
We need a part two before he goes
When i worked in the US for half a year i replaced my soda with selzers. there are a view very heavily flavoured ones but some lighter ones. personally I prefered the lighter flavoured ones. check them out
I drink Soda, and prefer to drink Coke products but I can enjoy a Starry if I go to Taco Bell
I do not do as you say mat pat, but I do do as you do in the case of drinking, no CHUGGING Diet Coke
Soda gang!
Not sure why this isn't in the 'Soda Theories' playlist; it's literally one of the best ones!
I have never tadted diet coke.........
OMG is that my Harris Teeter? Walnut Street in Cary?!
well that title aged poorly

serious question thought matpat....where did you get that red hooded jacket because its nice and i want one lol
Hey Matt, Pat, I just giving this idea of ​​the thought on mine. You don't need to really do this or nothing if you don't want because you don't a blog channel about talking about your family or something like that to have memories of your family and also I'm gonna miss you very much so I'm very sad about that. I just wanna give you this idea to just think about it OK
For my is other : soda but with an Italian accent
I wasn't surprised the weird cough syrupy one was Boylan... I wanted to like them too, but they always seem to miss the mark some how.
Shasta aka hospital soda
Only OGs remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke
fountain drinks are a terrible metric because the ratio of syrup to carbonated water is entirely incosistent. it was probably sweeter cause it had a bit more syrup than normal coke
green eans empire
“Let’s get pourin’, look out MatPat, here it comes,” couldn’t have been an accident. The captions are crazy. 3:46
Problem with the fountain is depending on how it's set up the flavor can vary wildly!
Dr. Pepper isn't considered a cola?
D
You got a real Eddie Valient thumbnail there.
i call it a soft drink
I'm Aussie.. so I'm D: other - we call them soft drinks.
why does it feel like shes making eyes with the carnera guy like flirting hopefully im wrong but feels that way
Try ICE
3:44 if you put on subtitles it says in there P 0 R N
Australians say soft drink
its the fact they said it was terriable but kept drinking???
I grew up calling soda, “fizz” 😅
We call it fizzy drinks in UK
15:30 in Britain it’s called fizzy drinks 😂
Diet coke was prep to quit youtube
Mountain Dew Spark is the best soda hands down, and i will physically fight people over this.
As someone who has never left the Midwest it is soda
In Jamaica we call "Pepsi or any sugary drink" juice
b
Food lion isnt north carolina specific we have it in maryland
in England we call it pepsi max!
i wonder if matpat still drinks harris teeter diet coke or if he's gone back to diet coca cola
We def say soda in the Midwest 😂
Is it just me or did matpat say p**n?
Boylan ginger ale is GOATED can’t say the same for its diet cola lol
I- Soda pop…
Ha ha mat pad. You are so hilarious you entertain me a lot when I feel sad thank you for your videos.😂😂😂😂
Has anyone ever heard of Rc  Cola
My favorite thing about mat nooooooo! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭! Why am I seeing this now!!
i though it was gonna be about how fake sugars arent good for your biodiversty of yout intestine and its worse in the longer run
halfway through bet they pick local soda (they definitely weren't payed for the endorsement)
B:Soda for New York
soft drink
we call them 'soft drinks' or 'fizzy drinks' :P
The bracket seeding being messed up is driving me insane
in australia we call it fizzy
you two are adorably made for each other
BREAKING: famous internet personality Mathew 'MatPat" Pathew was caught trying to steal the recipe to diet Coca Cola.
3:30 no wonder why you dont have pepsi max in this video.  Pepsi max is really good. 0 sugar, max taste!
WAIT FOOD LION ISNT EVERYWHERE?
Dr.pepper for life!!!
B
3:45 ☠️  Add English Captions ☠️
[clicks like because I saw Zevia soda in the intro] [clicks dislike cuz you're a huge youtuber with no sound treatment in the room]
apparently youtube too
Sorry but all Coke is bad.
I personally, am in the "other" category. I grew up with it being called "fizzy drink" or simply "fizzy", and somehow I then grew to refer to it as "sodie-pop".
Soft drink
I've actually had Crystal Pepsi, it's really good!  I was lucky the drink was in a general store near my apartment
Hehehehe
7:14  FAYGO AAAAAAH
the best cola ive ever had was from a brand called 40 kola
Im soda pop
Soda all the way! 😍
And here I am in 2024 where Matpat hasn't even mentioned Harris Teeter's cola since
Wait you live in North Carolina?I never knew that so do I
Well I am the oddball that likes Zevia.
water??
My question is why go diet, when the sweeteners in diet are ironically less healthy. They have more kcal and linger in the body way longer. Why not make your own natural cola?  Believe it or not, there are recipes to where naking your own cola syrup are out there Mat and I do recommend it. You make it like a simple syrup with ~2 parts cane sugar to every one part water. Meanwhile the ingredients are things like Lemon, Orange, Lime, Star Anise, Cardamom, etc. Even add in Vanilla bean, Cinnamon or Cherries for whichever flavor you want. Sure it has more calories, but those natural sugars are easier to burn in the body.
For the question in 15:32, in my country, Malaysia, we call it "air gas" or "gas water".
SODA FOREVER!!! (I drink almost any soda ( sprite, ginger ale, coke, pepsi, Fanta, Etc.
I call everything coke
3:44  What did Matthew Patrick mean by this🤔
Publix is amazing
in the netherlands its the name of the drink, so like coca cola, cola zero, fanta, casis, pepsi zero, pepsi max etc. never any other naming
D i call it Fizzy
I tried to get into Zevia cause when I was younger the clear cola was so cool to me. It seemed so magical and then my first sip I was disgusted. it didn't taste anything like cola and the stevia was overpowering like you said. I was super bummed.
:)
C. Tennessean
He ruined the result by having the thumbnail say i quit Diet Coke
only broper british people call it fizzy drinks
what does '7th seeded' and ' 10th seeded ' mean?
In Iraq we call every type of cola Pepsi
Mat: let me explain this flavour. Also mat explaining: not good
B for names No one here in Florida has ever called a non-coke soda coke
coke
Did you continue using it after this video?
I’m coke, so B
Hold on, lemme go get my can.
The title is more tragic than matpat retiring
and I like McDonald's Diet Coke too
Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero all the way for me
Why does the 2D MatPat have a striking resemblance to my friend
Since Matpat is leaving I'm rewatching every one of his episodes
Fountain coke always tastes like it's watered and less carbonated to me.
I might be weird but stevia is amazing
Bro for march madness we researched animals and did winners [bracket style] Pls get the pun 🙃
None of those food stores are in my area😂
E

b
now im just mad i cant have harris teeter cola bc i live in chicago
Hmm if you live in Northern California, I’m thinking of doing this for root beer!! (On my own time) What are your Northern California favorite root beers!? If you got a brand, that is local within Northern California; then please comment below!! I rarely drink my root beer, but when I do; I’m pretty particular like matpat!! Also thank you matpat for this video, because it’s made me think of doing something similar to yours!! Also we will miss you!!
Apparently sugar free sweeteners are worse for your health than real sugars. However, there is the risk that aspertame is a carcinogen. There is limited evidence however, so take this with a grain of salt.
17:33 I tried some powdered citric acid once. I'm not allowing myself to again. It's so good.
15:17 ummmm Minnesota and, Wisconsin I grew up with said Soda. Pretty sure the Dokotas would be the same considering the people in the movie sound like western Minnesota
OMFG I want Shasta Kiwi Strawberry so bad.
00:40 Use to know you as the guy my eldest kid watched FNAF stuff for. Then I watched. Now, I'm a lil sad you're going to be in less videos.
It’s funny how this is how I learned that people consider Food Lion a southern grocery store when i see a lot in many parts of Maryland
In Australia we call it soft drink
No Kroger-owned grocery stores in South Florida, unfortunately.
❤
I grew up on food lion
One time in science class we did a mammal March madness which happens every year (not in real life tho) that a college makes and it’s honestly so much more fun
I will mis him
Any one from Australia who says fizzy drink???
I like pepsi most
I’m soda 15:31
I’m soda
this blows my mind I thought the title was clickbait
Me watching this video for the fifth time
I'm a soda guy myself. But does it really matter what you call it? As long as it tastes good, it can be called soda, pop, coke, or anything really. As long as it's delicious to drink.
B
not me living in North Carolina
Food lion is part of the delhaizegroep which is a belgian brand
D.    Soft Drink
Here soda is called brus (BRUte-S with a soft R)
soda pop guy
Will he continue now that he is retiring?
Pop
So funny thing now I am dating someone who is allergic to citric acid so how weird is that?
Not this video having 11 million views 😂 everyone being concerned for Mat Pats sanity
MatPat is Diet Coke's secret admirer.
Pop
The fact that mat can know the diff between fountain, can, and bottle amazes me 😂😂
Hello
Not only did he quit diet coke! He quit YouTube..
I am Norwegian so I say brus
i miss this intro
Only people that were here before matpat quit can like  Like for the fallen soldier he will be missed 😢
LÄSK!
3:48 its *over the teeth and through the gums, look out tummy here it comes. "not over the teeth and over the gums look out matpat here it comes" as matpat said
citric acid is also what you probably SHOULDN'T have if you feel sick lol.
Harris Teeter for the win! Love an underdog story, and loving even more that my local Harris Teeter is just a few minutes away. 💯
I’m england we either say soda or pop (more popular option)
I am watching this video.... so many years... Matt goodbye. legend.
THIS video is how i found out food lion isn’t a nationwide chain????? i assumed it was like walmart but just for groceries 😭😭 not as bad as when i figured out there were barely any bojangles outside of nc
food theory makes me sad now
We will miss you Matpat
2  years later... he quits YouTube 😢
Soft drink
This is soooo sad knowing his leave
19:20 you made mistake when your helper reveals what coke they are. In the start every round he reveals what they were. You should have been kept in distrust the whole competition
in sweden have a thing called julmust. its kinda like a weaker cola
♿
i made a outfit that looks like mat pats outfit in gta 5
I find it funny that MatPat was saying Food Lion beating Diet Pepsi was a win for North Carolina, because Pepsi was also created in North Carolina, so either way it’s a win for NC.
Canadian soooo pop!
Aussie Pepsi is better than Aussie coke. I think coke in America is way sweeter
My grandma drinks Zevia
me watching this litteraly drinking coke

Sodastream if done perfectly can be really good.
Coke used to make soft drinks for Kroger back in the day.
God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit (sometimes referred to as the Holy Ghost) (three beings that are simultaneously 100% separate and 100% together as one being, known as the Trinity. A good example which was used by St. Patrick is the 3-leafed clover. Just as there are three separate leaves, they are also one being simultaneously.) loves you all so very much, past the point of sending Jesus Christ, God's only Son, who is perfect and never sinned, to pay the price for our sin, so that we can go to Heaven. And that is what they did. Jesus came to earth in the form of an infant child, born to a poor young couple. Jesus died a terrible death on a Roman cross. The last three hours that He was on the cross He endured the full wrath of God. God the Father turned away from His Son for the first time in eternity. Jesus experienced an eternity of burning from fire that produces no light, loneliness, suffering, indescribable pain, somehow concentrated into 3 hours. After those horrible 3 hours were done, Jesus died. He was placed in a stone-sealed tomb.   On the third day of His Death, He came back to life! God the Father raised Him from the dead. A few months later, Jesus physically rose up from the surface of the earth, and now He is in Heaven, building a place for those who believe in Him, and interceding on the behalf of those who believe in Him to God the Father. For those who believe in Him, our sin debt is paid in full. We can never lose our salvation, either. No matter what sins You have committed in the past, Jesus has paid for them all. He paid for every single   sin in all eternity, even in the future. Once we are truly saved, we can never ever lose our salvation. Jesus will return too, after the Tribulation. The Tribulation could start any minute. It will not be too late to become a Christian, but You will have to live through however long of the Tribulation God allows you too. When the Rapture happens, and it could happen anytime, God will take all those who are currently believers to Heaven. They will not have to go through the Tribulation. All this could start any day, any minute, any second. Whenever God chooses.   Please accept Jesus as your Savior, and let Him into Your life.

bro goes to his dealer for diet coke
Boylan’s birch beer is immaculate. Don’t mess with the colas though
I thought the title of the video would be clickbait, not a spoiler
I have asked my coworkers for a coke, assuming they would know I mean my fav mtn dew can. They got me a Coca-Cola and I was so sad. I had to explain how the south categorizes all as coke
I think one of the hang ups they have with Boylan and Johnnie Ryan is maybe that they arent used to the cane sugar in soda? I dunno, they dont sell those soft drinks where I live so 🤷‍♀️
im "frisdrank" its dutch for soda
The answer to that is yes me and my dad did a small little taste test between the Harris teeter and Coca-Cola and we both preferred the Harris Teeter one
Sans!!!! SANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
matpat likes fruity things… 💅✨
D) Soft Drinks
So let me get this right. You have an opinion. Then she has an opinion. Then you agree with it like almost every time. So the test same is basically one?
In Australia we call it Fizzy or Fizzy drink!
In Northeast Ohio some of our hospitals serve Shasta with their patient meals 😂
Carbonated water with lemon, salt and some sugar >> We need to stop consuming sodas
I can smell boylan soda thourght the screen
Only OG's remember MatPats obsession with Diet Coke
You lie you touching Coke zero
one of my favorite theory videos
I call it pop
i'm a soda person (west coast SF bay California)
no
just drink sun cola
If your trying to find a replacement  get some grape soda
I call it pop
does that meen i can take the roll\
I wish I could see HEB brand here
A
Marketing sucks, man. People underestimate off brands, but they are legitimately better in every aspect. Great value? They sell vacuums, dairy, cleaning products, household supplies, deserts, the list goes on. The fact that a company with so many varying products, known for being worse and cheap, can out compete industry giants with taste and price is insane. I hate walmart, but great value is a G
My loyalty is to standard non diet Coca-Cola and always will be, that being said I love Marianos and will be looking into trying their regular stuff instead of the diet
I'd say I'm a D ( other ), I say ''Fizzy Drink''.
Would love to see how this held up and if he's stuck with the new brand or gone back to coke
Finally, another fellow diet coke enthusiast.
Don't know how anyone can like that stuff, the only diet/zero sugar soda I can tolerate is mountain dew zero.
Pepsi zero sugar? You mean Pepsi Max
It doesnt surprise me that the Boylan was the disgusting cough-syrupy one. Every time I drink a cane sugar soda, it has this horrendous medicinal aftertaste that cannot be gotten rid of—and I *like* can sugar, I used to sneak pinches of sugar out of the bag as a kid. I dont know what is done in the process of making soda with cane sugar that makes it disgusting, but it makes the drink un-swallow-able.
Kroger is going own all grocery stores in 2024, including Safeway and Albertsons and all they own.
Or look at the ingredient list for citric acid? Based on Steph, it's literally MSG at this point
Does MatPat still live in NC? And anybody know the general area because it would be so dope to see him without going far out of the way since I LIVE near to NC
I’m an Aussie so soft drink
as a fellow Diet Coke addict, I found a really enjoyed fruity seltzers after I mostly stopped diet coke. they just felt really refreshing
I’ve called it pop my whole life
Technically, I guess, as an experiment, they shouldn't be reacting to a drink before the other has had the chance to taste it so they are not influencing each other.
only ogs will remember matpats obsession with diet coke
I haven’t been watching much Theorist’s video for a few years, and for some reason I couldn’t recognize Stephanie 😮 She looks different than what I remembered. At the start of this video I thought MatPay invited some food/drink scientist as a cohost or something.  I don’t mean any disrespect or anything. Simply stating a fact that I couldn’t recognize her at first.   Still, a great episode!
Cause pepsi is better
Where is water in the competition. It has 0 calories and really easily available
AWESOME
Soda
I was watching this episode and then somethi g traumatic happened there was a pepsi ad
I like the idea of stevia as well, but the problem with stevia is it has a certain flavor to it, and that flavor really doesn't taste good in drinks.  It may be good for baking though.  Stevia suffers the same problem that aspartame does in that it makes drinks taste terrible.  Overall in general I would rather have Splenda or just plain sugar.  I find that most people in the North call carbonated drinks pop, and most people in the South call them soda.  My favorite pop throughout the years has been Pepsi.  Just regular Pepsi (non diet).  I prefer it in a glass bottle or a can.  I think I'm going to try some off-brand colas to see if any of them can beat Pepsi.
I have some doubt that a Fred Meyer in Alaska will use the same generic soda supplier as their stores on the opposite end of the continent, but I'll give it a try next time I go.
In Czechia they call all sodas lemonade
15:29 I call it pepsi
Oh I know you, your the guy from the fnaf musical with markiplier
No you didn't. cause two years later your addicted again.
Expected joke: "I quit Diet Coke... and switched to Coke Zero!" But no, this was amazing. One soda couldn't be found, so a last-minute replacement was entered instead that narrowly beat out it's fellow local store brand, tied in the semifinals, and went on to take the championship. This deserves to be a movie.
I can smell all the drinks through the screen.
I don’t like Diet Coke at all
😨 my favorite colais  the kroger one
at the start of the video (no joke this is legit) when he said lets get pourin freinds subtitles got a little... uhhhh... well... if you know you know
Can you do an episode to see if soda is better for you than alcohol please?
I was just getting into Diet Doctor Pepper.
Pop til the very day I die!
Its pop
We need drink theory
There's no such thing as too sweet unless Stevia sweetener has the same effect as artificial sweetener Zevia's probably The most healthy thing you have in that room But I get it's not as good but I still replace the diet stuff with Zevia
Sorry but diet drinks are bad for you In fact not much better than original I already did a comment why on 1 of the Videos Which is the video on how long you can survive in a locked Marketplace
Boylan is my choice when I go out and I hope it has a run
bruv there called fizzys
I don't care what you say sam's cola og is good.
0:26
0:27
Soda
😭😭😭 RIP Matpat x Diet Coke   Our greatest love has been broken.
Other fountain drinks
B I am a b soda!
D
Monkey see monkey do
Only ogs remember matpats Diet Coke obsession
Coke over Pepsi.
Americans will do anything but drink water
you CANT exclude glass bottle coke...
15:31  other: soder 😅
9:56 it depends on the flavor of zevia in terms of flavor
8:37  If it taste like cough syrup then it’s probably expired I’ve drank boylan it doesn’t taste like that, although it was regular not diet, in that case try the regular and also try Rc cola it’s awesome it goes great with a moon pie it’s a real southern delicacy
I personally like sprite and Fanta
Only ogs still remember that he love Diet Coke
can confirm food lion has the best sodas
Coke Zero is the best option
water
A
I call it soda
Kroger is HUGE I work at Albertsons in the west and it’s currently being bought by kroger
Yah If you like stevia then plz go zevias or other stevia alternatives, artifical sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame are terrible for your micro biome, can effect cognitive health as well bc micro biome is a direct line to cognitive health and function.
I'm a soda.
Have you ever tried water🤔
I was hoping for a Diet Coke upside or downside health discovery
the easiest end to the soda/pop debate: google image search Cream Soda. Got it? right right. google image search Cream Pop. See? but that's just a theory...
Pop
ive tried the shasta root beer and i like it
Coke Zero, its way better than Diet Coke and I know I'm right because I watched your fnaf videos with all the lore so yeah
It is still funny how americans have "diet coke" instead of "cola light". Does it really make people drink this as part of a diet? :D
POP and only pop 15:28
way to branch out.
Coke
Coke zero is top tier idk  how anyone likes diet coke haha
You cannot beat matpat at drinking coco cola
3:43 what?!
I can immagine Harris Teeter owners wondering why they suddenly sold so much of their diet soda starting in May of 2021.
The fact I was recommended this while drinking Diet Coke 😭
Literally I remember how I learned about dopamine with Diet Coke with matpat 🥺
fountain versions of cola are ALWAYS superior short of fountain malfunctions
Kroger brand (Big K) is awful...
Im a soda person, my boyfriend is a pop person.
in denmark we call it sodavand which means soda water also im a huge coke zero fan but we dont have coke diet in denmark
6:24
Pop, always pop, i'm Canadian, and it and toque, verse beanie are the only things that are just facts :P haha
Shasta is pretty much the only soda in our house cus cheap, so idk what he means by shasta being bad?
Haha know this was two years ago but sodapop
How bout the very recent discovery that the most popular sweetener that sugar-free beverages use damages DNA?
The way I see it, pop is a big umbrella term for all carbonated soft drinks. Soda is a subset of pop that is like orange soda, grape soda, etc. Coke is anything with that cola flavor. But everything is pop
Never expected a large YouTube channel to mention “Food Lion”
Im other because Im from norway and we call soda Brus
As a humble Brit I call it fizzy drink
Maybe MatPat loves diet Coke more than he loves Steph
In Australia we call it soft drink.
can you imagine if matpat never figured out his new favorite diet coke if he lost at rock paper scissors.
14:40 Is Food Lion really only a Carolina/Southern thing? Lived in North Carolina all my life and thought they were a national grocery chain.
Soda
I always preferred the publix generic sodas. Unfortunately I now live in the Midwest and no longer have publix 😭😭
Only ogs will remember MatPat's obsession with Diet Coke
the rock paper scissors segment just shows how perfect they are together XD
I was a food broker for many national brands. Many store brands are produced by the National Brands. some are exact replicas of the National brand and others are slightly different. All Frozen Chicken at Walmart and Sam’s Clubs are Tyson exact match’s, however    Nestle Ice Cream makers of Haagen Daz will make private label brands but none will ever be an exact match for their Premium Brand formula.
Soda
Fizzy drink 👇
Food theory: I quit diet coke.... I only have pure coke (directly from columbia)  XD
i've lived in the south my whole life, and i've NEVER heard anyone call soda pop or coke.
this is crazy my dad does the same thing he drinks like 4 coke zero
B I'm call it soda ʚ😁ɞ
Boylan’s cream soda is amazing, and definitely my favorite soda, so it’s sad to see that their diet cola tasted so… subpar
I live in Texas and havent met anyone who calls soda "coke" everyone uses soda
Aus here. Fizzy drink
Only OGs remember matpat's obsession with diet coke
I got a free Diet Coke with take out cause they didn’t have reg coke. I took one sip and threw it out. I don’t think I have ever had a full can of Diet Coke.  If I’m drinking a sugar drink, I’m all in. Mexican made coke for me.
so its been 2 Years now, is mat still drinking Harris Teeter Diet Coke?
I’m in Costa Rica, any advice?
What about Sprite Zero
I call it soda, but time to time call it pop
i love my self so coke. also i combine soda and pop together, sodapop is what i call it
WAIT MATPAT LIVES IN NC WHAT A W
20:46 please someone, take this out of context, and make a meme out of it.
The three top diet colas I prefer are Diet Rite, TaB (sadly TaB died during Covid), then finally Sam’s Cola Zero.
We have food lion here in Georgia and I was always told it’s like a “food depot” 😂
As someone who works at a soda/cookie shop, I can confirm that you are not alone in liking Diet Coke. The chaos that occurs when we run out…. It changes a person. 😰
Diet soda is bad. Mountain Dew is best.
You should try slovenias cocta....its amazing
I drink 365 because I trust stevia as a sweetener more then what is in most diet sodas, 365 diet uses stevia as it's only sweetener, and it's non GMO and has a bpa free lining. it taste far closer to a Coke then Zevia does and it's far cheaper. I tried a brand from Europe called Green cola and they were good and similar to Coke as well while using stevia. problem is that Green cola also cost to much for me to get regularly so 365 is my winner for being a healthier alternative to diet Coke that doesn't break the bank and still has a coke like taste. If your really rich then Green cola might be a good alternative. I had to buy Green cola online though so maybe its cheaper if you can find it in person.
NO WAY
Matpat does not speak for the Midwest 🤣
my dad drinks Mountain Dew but i am more for the cherry variety : Mountain Dew Code Red
I thought it said I quit doing coke
Regular Boylan Cola is way better than any other soda I’ve had. If you’re drinking diet, you’re doing it wrong
For the love of The Theory God you should try Faygo Diet Cola
diet pepsi is good and so is diet a and w root beer
In South Africa, we call it by their name, coke means coca cola.
1:26 I think this is the reason why coke hasn’t sponsored you yet 😂
Diet Pepsi
Pepsi
15:27 we call it ginger 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I’m soda
Living is SC, we LOVE food lion 14:33
Citric acid may run our world but I’m still allergic 😭🤣
What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what beat off sams cola? thats what i switched to from diet coke to save money
Okay. But what if I tried to drink gallons anyways?
I called it child beer
your lack of faygo concerns me.
I know this video came out 2 years ago but that intro got me hyped!!!!!!!🥤
where i live it is called soft drinks but most the people i know just call it fizzy drinks (sometimes i just call it painful hydration liquid but apparently it doesnt hurt to anyone else to drink fizzy things)
I have always subscribed to the theory that a person looks more beautiful when they are more loved. I just gotta say Mat that your wife is very beautiful. So is your son. It makes the content really wholesome!
World try next door even the states
I feel like they shouldnt have let diet coke be the fountain one, since you cant buy fountain diet coke at the grocery store to take home and store long term.
Steph is objectively correct that Coke Zero is superior. Diet Coke just has a horribly metallic flavor to me. It also tastes flat even when fully carbonated. Coke Zero at least tries to taste like cola. I actually like Pepsi Zero Sugar more than Coke Zero, in spite of enjoying regular coke more than Pepsi.   I just wish Red Bull would bring their cola back. That was hands down the best cola I have ever drank.
You guys do the sams cola as I sip my Sam’s cola😂 my mom doesn’t by CocaCola she buys Sam’s cola and I can’t taste a difference personally 🤨
I have a food lion were I live and I don’t live in North Carolina and I also have a publix
Naa in Europe we call it fizzy drinks
This is cute but something about this guy reminds me of matpat from game theory
Thanos: Impossible
Matt what about diet mountain dew
stevia is nasty and no one can change my mind
I’m a sucker for root beer, and I’ve noticed that I really like the fruity or floral-y flavor that some have. Interesting to know that other people really like it too!
Lol here is South Africa, we call it "cooldrink" or sometimes "juice".
Does his wife steph look like Natalie portman?
What about Cocta
coke zero is the only "diet" cola i drink
He wasnt lying, but its not much better...
15:32 probably my opinión doesn't count because i live in a spanish speaking country but here we call it BEBIDA look in the spanish diccionary. And man... it is not already drinked man
15:32 ✨ effervescent beverage✨
D: other in most arab countries we mostly say pepsi
Why not drink water?
I live in North Carolina And I constantly drink the Harris Teeter and I'm not surprised it was so good for them
🗿
Dietcokelite
Diet coke lite is a dream drink for matpat
Soda  Ps I am from south australia
Can't sleep on HT.  They test highly in the cola wars repeatedly.
i say fizzy 😅
My country calls it soft drink
This was a huge lie.
WHO HERE GREW UP WITH SOFT DRINKS
Everyone that has tried it knows glass bottles are always best.
me and my mom love pepsi, i declare war!!!
As a fellow diet cola specialist this video was amazing. I know which one I'm trying next😂
Soda im from the west
Harris teeter stock after this video 💹
It all depends on who I'm with Sometimes I will call it Soda and sometimes I will call it Pop
Matpat claiming all Midwest folks say pop xD it’s like 50/50 man
Coke Zero tastes really good but after seeing a YouTube video on aspartame I got off all diet drinks or foods with it.  And I was a hard core Diet Coke then Coke Zero junkie.  I only drink Iceland Lava water now.
You betrayed diet coke
Deit coek
i’ve seen this video so many times that i’ve almost memorized this entire video
i just call them (coca cola pepsi orangeade ect) fizzy drinks 🤣
How dare you Dr Pepper is the best in the entire world Coke I hate Dr Pepper is the best soda ever
we need more steph in the videos! your chemistry is so funny lol
Soda pop
no way food lion is small isnt it known everywhere
THIS IS ONE OR THE BEST VIDEOS EVER THATS A FACT
I find it so weird how in USA they call Coca-Cola "Coke"
me who lives in canada :(
Is citric acid what makes diet Pepsi so disgusting? I love me some diet Coke but diet Pepsi is the anti Christ in soda form
This makes me so sad!  Both myself and my son found a kindred spirit with your diet coke fanaticism - and now you're a traitor 😢!
coke zero sucks. i am a soda sommelier, and i cannot get through a bottle. Between the big 3, pepsi zero is my favourite, followed by diet cola and then diet pepsi

Coke❤
15:32 im a Pop Soda Coke kinda guy
I think this is my 5th time watching this video
for me the answer of 15:30 is D because at least in the part of México I was born and raised at, we say "refresco" XD
D: Soft Drink, Aussies have the best system
Yes, you should definitely quit diet Coke. Curious, it doesn't look like you did any research for the ingredients in diet Coke, have you? Those artificial sweeteners are suspect for sure and would like to see what you come up with for Aspartame.
I'm from Goa & here in India, we call them softdrinks
You have Sodastream Cola in US? We only have Sodastream Pepsi here 😳
Harris being the unexpected MC that joins and and wins challenge.
I want to try 2. coke zero now have salt. I hope diet coke can return my country one day or something similar replace it.
food theory idea can u see if you can live a longer life by being vegan or if we sure stay with the dead cow and pigs
Kroger does ell the tastiest diet cola, Diet Pepsi!
I'm so glad I'm not the only diet cola lover that KNOWS that can/plastic/fountain all taste distinctly different. Never plastic, ever. 🤮
he lied
soft drink (in the AU it call soft drink because its not acahlic and yes everyone calls it that even kids)
All i want to say is that I work at harris teeter and I was sitting hear cheering my brand on XD
Food lion is in south Carolina
Harris teeter and food Lion are in south Carolina too
Diet carbonated drinks are cancer causing everyone do not drink anything diet like Diet Coke!!!!.⚠️
i say läsk because im swedish
I’m Nigerian and many people refer to soda as “minerals” up until maybe the mid 2000s but now it’s mostly called sodas
coke
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮
litrauly watched this whith my vuzy drink mixed whith DEIT COKE.
Hes still addicted.
D i call it fizzy drinks i am from ireland
first time i ever wanted a cola brand to win in a tournament
I call  it “corn syrup sugar water”
I want to see soda bots and destroy Pepsi man
This was fun! Awesome video! Did you have two "7th Seeded" sodas? Boylan & Pepsi?
2020:Diet coke left the server 2021:Diet coke joined the server
Here in southwest PA my friends and I always said we were going to get soda from the pop machine
Diet Coke can cause cancer
florida is not the south... its florida its the only state where going north gets you deeper in to the south  also yeaaaah boylans diet stuff is pretty bad....
Imma pop kind of man
My grandma called it tonic.
I am vary suprised that you are no longer drinking dite coke
The best diet soda in my opinion is home brewed tea
In Australia we call it a fizzy drink
Big K is top tier.
Being from a state without a Food Lion, there store brand everything was so good when I tried them on vacation. The pop was especially excellent.
excuse me WHAAAAT
B E P S I
Boylyn is good. I got a combo pack with a bunch if different flavors and they were pretty good. It didnt habe the diet though.
Hamburger.. and Sprite.
i will never give up diet coke
He should do a video on why people are addicted to Diet Coke
Im a d because i absoloutly love ice tea
cool video, shocking ending! I'm a coke Zero addict myself. I do not care much for the no names/store brands here in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, though they sure do vary wildly in quality.
pepsi max > diet coke/zero. I'm just saying.
Soda
The reason why pepsi lost so hard is that Pepsi needs to be served with ice for the proper flavor
Why are all the comments sooo long
My recommendation would be to quit cola altogether. It's extremely sour and therefore very bad for your teeth.
I was partially expecting to see Pepsi or a big soda brand commenting one of their sodas that he should try.
That many rock paper scissors ties is impressive
Food Lion soda is wonderful for some unknown reason
No royal crown?? the king of unknown sodas?? /s
Hi
Oddly enough, I love smith's (Kroger) soda
I live in the midwest and we all call it soda
As a fellow Harris teeter local (we call it Harry teets where I’m from) I can confirm they have the absolute best diet soda ever
i think u have to give diet pepsi a second chance 😅
diet sams club
Here in Europe Diet Coke is called Coca-Cola light
D: other. In scotland we mostly call it 'ginger'
Barrs>>>
I say coke
Im a guy who says pop
Boylans orange soda isn’t too bad but their root beer is awful
Right from the start I was concerned with fountain DC being the representative, as I'm not sure installing a fountain in my home was going to be feasible, lol.
Matpat lives behind the Harris teeter probably near burning Han dr
Shasta California dreamsicle
Short Answer No, no he didn’t
I actually use soda pop, what does that make me?
You can tell the caffeine was getting to them
I hope to drink until I die and I mean it
MATE ITS FIZZY DRINKS D: other
Have you tried kofola yet? It’s from Czech Republic so it’s not the easiest to get but in my opinion it’s better than any cola
Fuzzy brown liquid
I, who am now type 2, had to cut out my long standing soda addiction and find other things like Sparkling Water and such to supply my needs. Diet has always been a dirty word for me, because I was not born with the gene that allows for people to like the taste of Aspartame. I actively avoid it if I can (though I've found that the Zero products are not so bad).  The Zevia brand Stevia sodas seems to be dependent upon which one you're drinking. Their Ginger Root Beer being my favorite, their Cream Soda is by far the worst.  I've found I'm much more tolerant of anything that has Sucralose in it, as I don't get the same artificial sweetener aftertastes from it that I get from Aspartame or the same blegh kind of reaction get from Stevia.
15:33 I am Brus, but for the sake of English speakers, I'd be B: Soda.
08:35 The moment they said No.2 tasted like cough syrup, I knew it was the glass bottle coke. Coke was originally created as a form of medicine back in the days, and thus, it wouldn't taste very good - unless you happen to be one of the ones that like that sort of thing. They said earlier that the glass bottle coke creator hadn't changed their recipe since they started 100 years ago, that means it would still taste more like some kind of medicine than actual soda.
05:01 From the "This one is slightly sweeter" I could accurately tell that the middle one was bottled Diet Coke, the left (right for them) was can, and the "slightly sweeter" was the Dispenser Diet Coke. Dispenser soda is a mixture between carbonated water and soda syrup, syrup has a more sweeter taste to it, especially if the mixing isn't as watered out as I am used to. Bottled coke fizzes a lot, so that middle glass being the bottled coke was a no brainer. Then that only left the canned coke.
5:09 Sephanie (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) moved the middle one and the right one (our right) to the middle. And they didn’t get moved back. So the one that they chose to represent diet coke is the bottle one when it should have been the fountain. That means that their guesses are incorrect because the glasses have been moved. Unless they moved them again off camera then just ignore what I commented 😅
pop
Someone probably already mentioned this, but there is a Kroger in Raleigh as well.  2603 Glenwood Ave Ste 101 RALEIGH, NC
Kroger executives be happy
i call it fizzy
My family shops at a Harris teer and usually we would get the regular Harris teeter cola other than Coca-Cola because one they taste exactly the same and to the Harris teeter brand is cheaper
Regular Coke isn't healthy but it is the better of the two. Diet Coke kills brain cells... It ages you.    Same is true for any Zero branded soda   Sorry....  Kafola you should try... Cola that not cola from Czech Republic.  Do you guys have Tizer and 7up in the US?  I *think* they are pretty excusive to the UK.
Me drinking Diet Coke watching this masterpiece:
Too bad you can't get Albert Heijn Cola Zero
https://youtu.be/uG4pUCWNV8U
wow, I can't believe that this was two years ago now
I keep telling myself I am not addicted to Coke Zero, but ayntime I taste it it feels like the god of sparkly liquids has blessed my toungue with the artificially sweet sensation and I want to drink an entire bottle in one sip
Imagine the first matchup was diet coke vs harris teeter and diet cokr got instantly elimanted 😂
Team soda all day. It says soda on most cans.
Ah the illusion of choice. Thanks capitalism.
Soft drinks
a
Can you cover Aspartame is dangerous or not????
I saw the title and thought this was a send off to Matpat forever because he died😅
I would say either cold drinks or soft drinks
Um...Steph? Are...are you okay? Stephanie looks so emo in this video and it genuinely just strikes me as a cry for help.
I'm A & B but mostly B.
I grew up with all carbonated soft drinks being cokes. I say soda about as much now because I moved a state up.
How much is a lot? I drink one can a day of Coke Zero
you mean diet coc?
I THINK THE ONE HE CHOSE HAS A SIMILAR RECIPE TO COCA COLA ULTIMATE!!!!! IT TASTES EXACTLY HOW HE DESCRIBES!!! I’m having the zero right now but I’m assuming it’s the same or similar if it’s not zero.
Pop
Boylan’s rootbeer is fine but their ginger ale is really good if you like ginger (which I do)
😅soda
Hm
I am insulted I didn't see Diet Moxie.
matpat now is actually insane
the kroger big K brand has both diet cola and zero cola, the picture he uses is harris teeters zero cola, i wonder which one he is referring to. the zero or the diet version?
The funny thing is that I’m drinking a Zevia while watching this video!
now aspartime is a carcinogen
A little late but you guys forget to cleanse your pallets after each taste? Especially e finals where hi through 3 cups tasting, the last one will come out weird or bland because if a previous simulation?
We're C's around here. Lol
15:29 I’m B, soda is universal, like pop, but soda just rolls off the tongue better for me
I like these videos but why doesn't he ever cleanse his palate between everything he tries for competitions like this.
Dr Thunder is the best  🤔
"What type of coke do you want?" I want mine in a little plastic baggy and with the consistency of sugar please
i used to live in a place in virginia where everything is mtndew
try fanta exotic it is my favorit it is very good
Stephanie has her weird cookie dough ability, Matt has Diet Coke.
I live in North Carolina so yes I have heard of food lion, I’ve gone there multiple times 😂
Fizzy
Used to drink so many cokes a day but thankfully I’ve quit and now what I do is take one out I plan to drink and never do
All may pay would talk about is fnaf and his Diet Coke obsession
I am all
A
For what to call the drink, I'm a mixture of options A and B. I call it sody pop.
Pepsi max will always be my favourite espesially the cherry flavour
Mat I have food loin because I'm Virginian
Soda
B
Cola
"Wow"
Harris Teeter is that fancy coke
Does anyone else think Pepsi vs Coke is a marketing strategy
Everywhere I see boyalin birch beer around I buy it and I know a few places
Yes i have seen a food lion
YOU CHOSE HARRIS TEETER’S DIET COLA! YOU SAID IT HAD A CITRUS AFTER TASTE! YOU SAID NO EXTRA TASTES! IT SHOULD NOT HAVE WON!😡😡 (I’m not really mad. I’m just pointing out something that I noticed.  I really like your videos.😂🩷)
WOHOOOOOO!!! NORTH CAROLINA!!! So that's why in the TikTok McFlurry thing he said about Cookout being a home chain and I recognized it :))
I was so expecting this to be more about getting away from the artificial sweeteners,not just maybe finding a better tasting diet soda lol
B:soda
1:00 LOVES DIET COKE 😂
I think im in d in my native language we call it soda vatn or soda water
d
Movie theater Fountain Max Pepsi (with ice) is the Goat of coke beverages, and you can't change my mind.
We call in frizzy juice in the East
All three
Round Robin or Swiss would make much more sense, but oh well
Depends on which county I'm in. (I live in cali btw)
They should do best grilled hot dog brand vs store brand.
I see cola as a type of soda.   So, soda is the the more general term.  Idk what pop would be.  I don’t grow up using the term like that.  It may be synonymous
I thought Shasta was a Jamaican brand. Smh
my first thought when i saw this was wtf
“You’ve probably never heard of food lion”  Virginian:
I'm a B
No everyone knows Matt for being the Fnaf theorist 😂 but the ones who remember he is the Diet coke addict, are the ogs 👌🏻
Oather
I'm sorry Walmart's what cola?
we just name the drnk idk
My country always just called it “fizzy drink”
I call it soda for sure
Harris teeter was 10th not 13th
Harris teeter pizza
Soda for life I hate the other names lolx
20:46 stephs face lol
I don't really care about the Coke / Pepsi fight anymore even though I slightly prefer Coke. However, it's bizzarre to me that some people don't taste the difference. I've blind tasted them and it's obvious which is which even with light versions.
7UP
Who’s the hottie
MatPat you are sooooooo right!  Kroger Big K diet cola is the same awesome soda and it's now my favorite!!!
"North Carolina grocery store food lion" *= Delhaize*
Diet coke kills
soft drink :))
Diet soda tastes like soda but with a healthy dose of poison
I’m heartbroken that Harris teeter isn’t on Long Island
Here is Australia it’s a coke or soft drink
https://youtu.be/AsQzqoBovT4
10:51 had a secret sponser😂
3:46 turn on on subtitles and read what it says
You sound like that guy from, Edible Incredible
Harris Teeter in Wisconsin is Big K at Metro Market/Pick n Save.
soda
3:50 that was really sussy when just heard from far away 🤣😂also subtitles didn't help much
For any new viewers, let me just say, without spoiling it, that the best way to describe this episode is: Divine intervention!👍
Coke
This is one of my favorite Food Theories yet
Yay, I'm #TeamSteph. Always liked Coke Zero over Diet Coke and while there's no  Harris Teeter isn 't available here in NY. I can take Food Lion (Hannaford here in NY) as a good substitute for my #1 choice
like how he comments on how bad aspartame is yet diet coke and coke zero both have that ingredient 🙄
Where I’m from we say soda pop
Omg I love Harris teeter cola
Aspartame
🐌
2nd Commandment.
14:40 "...which you've probably never heard of..." me who has had food lion as my main supermarket almost my entire life
I saw the title and assumed it was going to be about diet soda and then causing cancer from the artificial sweeteners
I love this video, but i have 2 issues with it:  1). Almost every seed number was repeated twice.  2). There was more than one product representing brands, especially with Pepsi and Coke. Steph even stated that half of the bracket can't just be diet coke, yet diet coke and diet pepsi both had 2 products on the board.
Fun fact about food lion: It’s actually a belgian supermarket chain (at least, it was originally).
Im Coke, Pop, AND Soda.
COKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The best alternative should use stevia, the only healthy sugar replacement. Anything else will give you ulcers, brain cancer, kidney failure, liver cancer, etc. Sucralose is healthier? Seriously? Well if you consider having kidney and gut cancer healthy then sure, knock yourself out.
It’s not an addiction, it’s a HOBBY
Soda
come at me i call it soderpop *like soda and pop in one word*
Note to self, figure out where the heck South Carolina is, and go there for soda.
we call it soda in texas
Pop
Out hear in Australia it’s soft drink
guess what else is good? 4 cheese harris teeter pizza
I say soda, but im not english and in sweden where im from we say läsk so in english i would say B: Soda. But i do say läsk at home so i will go with D: Other.
I am sooooo north carolinian the two closest grocery stores to my house are Harris teeter and food lion
I Will Never Accept the fact that Off brand Diet Coke is the Real Diet Coke
Pop
dddddddddddddddddddddddddd fiziy just
19:05 that's 1.56%to happen
NY here and my family calls it soda
lucky! I'm in the UK!
I'm C and D (for me, D is cola)
We call it Soft Drink because it doesn't have Alcohol
In Australia its called "soft drink" its anything but soft-
Pop by annoying my mom saying soda
I'm an "other" soft drink man, as I'm Australian
It has been 2 years, Matt never once mentioned the new soda again and went straight back to coke. Shame
I love zevia cola
Ewe Diet Coke a cola
Matpat no like Matpat LIke Matpat no like anymore
diet coke is my favorite too
What
Next episode invite Hank and John Green and repeat the experiment with their diet Dr Pepper obsession 😂
Bro needs to try water
you would think being a food theorist he would know that diet coke is actually WORSE for you than regular coke. that 0 calories is misleading
Wait some people don’t know what a food lion is
We have food lion and harris teeter here in Maryland as well. I’ve seen them stretch up into Delaware and even the beginning of Pennsylvania
b forever soda
Man. This hasn't aged well after the news that fake sugar is actually more dangerous to your health than regular soda
You can't compare fountain soda to bottles/cans, this experiment was a flop from the start
For me it’s either soda or coke
I like saying Fizzies to surprise people.
I have never understood how people can enjoy diet coke (unless you have a medical condition).... It's like taking a normal coke, tipping in a bunch of chemicals and calling it quits 😅 i'd rather drink just one regular coke instead of a case of diet coke 🤣
I is coke all soda’s are called coke for me
D. Other I am just fizzy drinks don’t know if that’s everyone in England 😂
Well  This aged well
I call it "soft drinks"
Regular Coke!
A
3:13 That gave me a shock of nostalgia to play Borderlands 2 again.
This is really random but I wonder if given two close choices: one and two people tend to pick one or two more often. I was asking this to myself as I was watching the tasting, really random thought but it’s kinda interesting to think about
Coke Zero is darker and nicer to me
in South Africa we call it cold drink. weird, I know
In my experience, Kroger products are always worth a try.
2 years later diet coke can give you cancer
Diet Dew is all I drink soda wise.
mmm i love that cancer drink 👨🏾‍🦲
In Utah and a lot of dr pepper
I'm from the uk, so it's coke to me
I say soda pop 😅   Stephs reaction was exactly what i thought 😂😂
I didn't know yall were in NC! I live in the better Carolina too.
i'm from australia and i call it fizzy like any soda (fanta, coke, solo, mountain dew, pepsi etc.) is called fizzy because its a fizzy drink 🤣
A: Pop B: Soda C:Coke D: other  The secret fifth option: all of the above.
maybe you don,t like can
6:21 😂
this is a joke right? RIGHT?!
I’m soda
the harris teeter incident was a canon event
Were soda or coke 15:32
I haven't seen the video yet, but I have a feeling that it'll still be Diet Coke
It's pop you demons 😒
In NYC(born and raised)we say soda
Fashion theory idea: does running barefoot really help your feet?
I just told my son that you two would make good Antman and Wasp!
I love to watch video. It is cool to learn new pop. Good work on the video.
Im a soda person
Me over here drinking diet water
In England we call it 'soft drinks'
Wheres matpat and what have ypu done with him
What about soda pop
15:30 A true North Carolinian would have said soft drink
10:22 FUCKING BLASPHEMY
is that the citric acid of 87
Try zx cola next
She wasn’t lying when she said Publix in Florida on about every  Street corner just about
glass bottle coke is different from plastic bottle
I call it soda
Amusingly enough my preferred drink is also a cola flavored soft drink... one thats been approved by my doctor too for that matter  ....annd its also something you cant find everywhere. Not only is it localized to one country, but its also only available in select stores around said country  Thankfully i live less than 2 km away from one.
In Japan, it Juice.
Me drinking Diet Coke watching this wishing I had the haris teter soda
Good honey 🍯 🍯 drink lots 💋 coffee and tea gorw 👍 and ❤😂😂🎉😢😢😮😮😅😊😊😮😢🎉😂❤
I have a Ralph’s near me. It’s an ice cream shop
seeing harris teeter beat johnny ryan irked me only bc i dislike the store chain even tho i’ve had neither 😅😅
turn on captions and go to 3:45😏
I know someone who has drank hundreds of liters of diet pepsi in this past year
please try Guarana Antarctica. it is Brazilian soda completely unique flavor and is amazing
My family and I used to have diet coke until diet coke have an ingredient that my family and I are allergic to aspartame so we decided to drink diet Shasta and diet right
I have the same type of addiction with root beer lmao
This video just make me realize how much mat would pull off a starlord (Peter quill) cosplay.
Sprite Zero
I just love boylan bottling's line of sodas. I'll drink 'em anyways
You know Food Lion isn't actually an american supermarket chain because it's based on the belgium Delhaize supermarket chain.
Color the Zeva.
There identical
Kroger is
I live in SC for four years and visited NC a few times but I've never heard of Harris Teeter
A 15:30
I can’t drink soda around my friend because he calls them bubblers and calling them bubblers makes me sad
That a boy Matt way to not be held under the heal of the coke overload.
I love how this video has more views than double the amount of subs he has... also this was a long time ago too...
soft drink
Generally tastes like failed lab experiments.
Late to the party here, but at the start of this video my 1st thought was "I wonder if they'll take co-packing into account" and there, at the end, they did. It would be interesting if they compared processing/packaging. I live in Maine, where B&M Baked Beans ruled until the brand was bought out. Now the product is a pale shadow of what it was (runnier, slightly undercooked, sweeter). Anyone in the know knows to look for the few remaining cans made in Maine and to avoid those from NJ.
Oh yeah I have a obsession with gingerale I feel u
Diet Coke is apparently the most hated soda for some reason.
I drink Pepsi don’t come after me
At 18:03 it said 13 seeded cola but on screen it said 10?
Did Anyone Else Break When He Chose The Underdog Over The Diet Coke
Im from PA and Ive been to food lion all too many times
Just me who grew up calling these sort of drink fizzy’s
Try sunkist zero sugar:)
Pop
I just saw the thumbnail and now I want some come
You should make FT Live
fun fact in romania we just call it 0 sugar we dont even say cola
I absolutely loved this video, it honestly reminded me of my brother and how much he loved Diet Coke. So I wanted to say thanks for giving me something to smile about today 💚
Idk about the best, but the worst diet cola is hands down cumberland farms brand. Idk how they messed it up so bad but it is UNDRINKABLE
My school has march madness music addition
What about calling it a “soft drink”?  My theory: back in the day and being in the Gulf, drinks like bourbon, whiskey, or moonshine was common and a lot of people had hard liquor to drink. So anything that wasn’t alcoholic was either water, juice, tea, or “soft drink”.
#bfb
Food Lion is not only in North Carolina. It is also in Maryland. That’s the only other place I’ve seen it but it’s there.
Soft drink
Coke
Kroger's diet soda tastes the same as name brand coke, same with thier full flavor soda. Kroger is the biggest grocery chain in my area
Anyone from California have no idea about all of these stores :/ ⬇️
I’m more of a “sodaroni” person
I drink energy drinks 300 mg daily 😂
I know this is an old video, but I have to give a shout-out to H.E.B. store brand sodas. My daughter is very allergic to corn which also includes HFC. She has a reaction to corn similar to lactose intolerants, but HFC is like corn². She loves soda but since 99% of the sodas out there use HFC as a sweeter, she thought she would never drink soda again. We found out that H.E.B. has an actually nice variety of cane sugar sodas that are really good.
Why 0 calories...
19:04
i say pop… my bf uses soda and sodapop
It was so funny hearing mat say "grocery stores you've probably never heart of...Food Lion and Harris Teeter" because you can find a teeter or food lion around every corner where i live, its like dollar tree😂
Never Changing means Never Improving, hear that conservatives?
i do
Can you use a manual air blower as a weapon
Imagine your just shopping and you see a person with a cart full of like 25 Diet Colas
If you live in North Carolina you know cheereine is da Best

I miss game theory's
When i read the title i literally yelled out NOOOOOOOOO!!!!
i love Shasta smhhh
the only pop i could drink was caffeine free Pepsi  so I'm happy i was drinking a good pop
Welcome to North Carolina, haven’t been in a while but this sums it up
Local virginian very proud pf Harris teeter and food lion and as a diet coke drinker thank you
15:32 In europe we don't say any of those. In my family we refered to them simply as sweet drinks. "What do you want to drink?"
in nz we have coke zero and zero suger
I'm a weird one mentally I flip between soda and pop and sometimes I say sodapop
I say sodo
I watch this at least once a month even though I know the outcome
Hi
Boylan's Cane Cola is my absolute favorite kind of cola. I love that peppery, kinda painful, old timey taste. I've never tried the diet version though.
Stevia is certainly an acquired taste but one worthy of acquiring. Fake sugars made from chemicals are often cancer causing.  Stevia, being a natural plant, is a truly healthy way to avoid sugar.  I slowly switched to Stevia plant for such health reasons.
MatPat looked like he was holding back millions of tonnes of tears while posing for the thumbnail as he pours out his oh so precious Diet Coke.😭
soda
Matt is likes fruity things 🍑lol
Let me guess Diet Coke won.  Edit: it didn’t the Harris teeter one won.
Do not try to drink that much soda it's horrible for u
No one blames you for denouncing Florida.
I say soda because I grew up in the west of the U.S.A
UR NAME IS MATHEW,NOT MATTPATT?!?!!?!!!!

imagine not drinking Diet Coke evrey 1 hour(not at night)
i dont know why but when i heard 365 cola i just went "DISNEY 365"
I call it Soda-Pop sometimes (: But normally it's just "Y'know. My drink."
Dude you and Old ppl are the only ones still drinking it and it tastes like flat coke anyway you should’ve been stopped
Mattpat is a guy that I love watching but also the guy I wouldn’t talk to often if he went to my school
As a Bipolar person who can not have sugar without massive moodswings, I drink coke zero and rootbeer zero sugar all the time Lol
I call it coca cola in nz
Just drink cold water
Food lion is not only in North Carolina! It’s in Virginia as well! And k don’t live near North Carolina i live near Maryland and West Virginia
im fizzy drink, pop sounds like a dad
Well, Matt, pat, I am your mom😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Idk why I love this episode so much. Most of the time popular YouTube don't feel so genuine but Mat and Steph just feel like that's really them.
2:27 top ten things that will make your liver explode
This gave me an idea for a FT video request: what’s the deal with grocery store names? I grew up in NC and Harris Teeter makes sense because it sounds like business partners’ last names, but WTH is a food lion‽ 🍱🦁🤔 I know Food Lion is a grocery store, but what is a food lion?… also, I now live in Colorado and we have King Soopers- I can’t get over what a stupid sounding name this is. Ours is actually called City Market, which sounds better. It’s confusing because I *think* City Market is owned by King Soopers and King Soopers is owned by Kroger(?)
Why not Mountain Dew because the theory a food theory thanks for commenting
Soft drink > Soda > Coke > Pop
As a British person I would probably just call them soft drinks or fizzy drinks
Cola ranja
Me an European... wholefoods I know that that's that thing from South Park
I was Watching this video while drinking a can of Coke zero sugar
Love how i saw all the were right near North Virginia in a big green blob😅
Both Pepsi zero ( or Pepsi max as it is called here in Denmark) and Diet Coke both has aspartame. So I don't know why you pointed it out at Pepsi but not coke
for me it is called sweet water (translated)
I find it interesting how people call carbonated drinks different things. Other than using pop or soda, I use ‘soft drink’.
The soda versus pop thing is kind of interesting.   I live in the family where we say soda pop because part of my family grew up in California as well as the south and in Virginia closer towards the Pennsylvania border as well as West Virginia.  Does that make my family weird where we use soda, pop, and soda pop interchangeably But we don’t do the southern thing of “I want a coke” and then give a specific Coke brand beverage
In the Philippines its soft drinks or coke
Soda
14:39 i live in nc so i know what food lion is lol
Aspartame is rapidly and completely hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract to phenylalanine, aspartic acid and *_methanol._* From chronic toxicity studies in animals, the possibility of developmental toxicity occurring at lower doses than 4000 mg/kg in animals could not be excluded.
I quit Diet Coke too. I drank exactly 2 cans a day. And went cold turkey. For caffeine, I started drinking coffee, which I never had before.
Now to quit carbonated AsparSacharSulfame K  Also the coke alliegence is with the brand that creates advertising and literal santa claus.
Pop
cold drink
Only drink diet soda if you want to vomit.  It should be outlawed.
I know im late but im fro georgia and we gottem publixes too
*spoiler*    2 years later and I'm wondering how much Harris Teeter's has taken over Matt's life over Diet Coke.
Just who cares about sports sports is lame
My grandpa calls them "soft drinks"
Still got 22 minutes to go,  but the obvious answer to "What diet cola" is, of course, Pepsi Max Cherry.  And although taste is totally subjective, anyone who disagrees is simply wrong.
Also Charlotte Represent!!
But didn't have Diet Coke Vs Diet Pepsi straight up
I still don't know why my teacher put this on in class lmao
Diet Coke is for moms
No food lion is in pa too
I call them fizzy drinks bc I’m from England 15:30
You know what they say.. "go woke, diet coke".
15:18 and here in britain its either soft drinks or fizzy drinks
If this video doesn't convince you to quit diet coke, this one definitely will ( sorry I know I'm 2 years late ) https://youtu.be/GmUDxtFnBfQ
Don't tell me what to do mat Pat you know what just for that I'm going to drink the entire 3 gallons of diet Coke
Diet Coke ain't Coke it water down dr. Pepper Coke is a soft drink because of the sugar if you take the sugar out of it then it ain't a soft drink so it ain't Coke it just drink like I said it's just water down dr. Pepper I'm sorry if you disagree with me on this but that's what I believe😡😤. Now I ain't saying that coke is better than Diet Coke even though my personal opinion that coke is better than Diet Coke but everybody has their own opinion so feel free to think whatever you want to think this comment is not meant to offend anybody. Also matpat I think you cool and I think every single video you make is awesome.
15:11 - 15:33 : Even though I now dwell in Florida, I'm a pop man too, MatPat! Midwesterners represent!
[6:02 - 7:02:] Now that I'm in Florida, my mom often shops at Publix. [I now plan to try Publix's soda next week.]
In the UK we call it Fizzy. Because it fizzes. Shocking i know. Its the same how we named 'chips' crisps. Because they are crispy.
i am in the uk its called poop
for coke and pepsi we say pepsi and for seven-up and sprite we say seven but most other sodas arent here in egypt
soda
I say cola
as a born and raised north carolinian i call it soda…..But i hate coke sooooo
2g 281kl
Haven't seen it in a while but diet stars and stripes was my moms favorite
Never heard of coke cola life
You guys drink soda everyday? Whoaa
here in England (south to be spsifice) we call it fizzy pop
Soda
Can you do Dr pepper and root beer
In canada i hear three names, soda, cola, and my personal favorite, CANNED FIZZY SUGAR DRINK
You can't get this in any other state or country (I think) but it's HEB diet cola
As a north carolinian who just found out you also live in NC, i was just happy to be able to recognize and know each and one of those NC-based stores :D
Oh, you finally got over your ex. You go mat! (Holy crap food theory came out over 2 years ago???)
I'm d fizzy because that's what we call it
My family has always gotten store branded sodas because they were normally cheaper, we’re on sale more often, and tasted the same or even better sometimes.
My...my family says soda pop....
I had no idea until last year that Shasta could be aquired outside of a hospital lol in my head Shasta was hospital brand soda.
b
You can 💀 from diet soda!
My doctor told me that if your gonna drink soda , drink regular. Diet is worse for you then reguar.
I can't stand the taste of artificial sweeteners. the aftertaste is SOOOO bad! The only one that doesn't make me wanna barf is sweetango (erythritol and stevia based) it tastes just like a kinda cold sugar.
Harris Teeter just fnaf of Diet Cokes 😂
Soda
Well that's so weird that he seemed so excited about diet Food Lion Cola beating out Pepsi because it is made in North Carolina. But Pepsi is also from North Carolina.
Boylan root beer is by far my favorite soda ive never had any of their other drinks but at least their root beer is amazing to me
I’m crushed that you didn’t try the sodas from the Piggly Wiggly.
Necro-commenting that I can vouch for the Kroger soda, specifically the Big K Caffeine Free Diet Soda. At least in the canned version it is far superior to Diet Coke IMO, in both flavor and “fizz longevity”. It is also about 1/3 the price on average.
Diet pepsi is based
D.....
i honestly prefer fountain diet coke over all other diet coke but not all fountain diet coke is equal... mcdonalds has the best diet coke, jack-in-the-box tends to have pretty decent diet coke at most locations, some other popular chain/franchised restaurants tend to be inconsistent in quality, and some local mom-n-pop restaurants with their distributor-supplied machines tend to have better diet coke than some chain restaurants. HOWEVER anywhere that has those "all-in-one" touch screen coke machines found at movie theaters, theme parks, and some chain restaurants tend to dispense consistently terrible tasting diet coke.
I call it fizzy pop
AFAIK Kroger isn't around MN.
And now her choice is no longer around.
3:45 look at the captions. Lol

Yooo wtf matt got a baddie 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 im jealous
DO NOT
It's bizarre but i was raised in a pop country but i'm a soda.
I'm a pop gal personally, might be because I live in the UK but whatever haha.
Coca  Cola Zero all the way. Sorry Matt Diet Coke is nasty lol. I would rather have Pepsi Zero than a Diet Coke. Always in a can too. Fountain is garbage and bottle doesn't go down the same way.
pop,chip,kukuk (chocolate) the "inuk special" in nunavut
Domestic Abuse Theory
pepsi is better
HOURLY BASIS
How about  replacing  soda with sparkling  water?
Even now he still drinks Diet Coke over Harris teeter. Brand loyalty, am I right?
rb battles season but it’s Diet Coke! LOL 😂
I drank Diet Coke since I was a young teen. I am now 67.  When I heard fake sugar was worse then real I swithched to regular Coke.  I never did like the taste of the regular so quit that as well. I no longer even drink soda except on a rare  occasion.  I drink unsweetened tea now.
Finaly I know house name Mattew (I hope that's how you spell your name😅) but I'm just going to call you Mat Pat or Food, Film,Game and Style theory... (•u•)
Dayum that was like a less dramatic anime storyline
coke
i dont realy drink soda but i will keep this vid in mind
i call it soda-pop so i guess im a nutral
I know you didn't ask for my advice, but drink water, at least mostly. And though it may be mostly benign, consider the effect of a caffeine addiction on your choices. Water is better for dental and bone health and never did cause obesity. And it is most refreshing. For caffeine, coffee and tea are nice.
Dr. Pepper
We call it soft drink in Australia
I'm pop
you guys totally missed the greatest cola of world: Jolly Cola Although it may be hard to find in NC...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au2MNdsdenM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1e2QpWRonQ
Add a lemon to your diet coke, I've been doing that for forever.
FIRST- I only up voted the video because I support small businesses. SECOND- you CAN'T compare a DIET to ZERO or STEVIA! The challenge is erroneous.
I don't like soda
My dude, I grew up in St. Louis, and soda is definitely what we called it.
How many do you have seeded 7?
Did you know that the in the last round there is a bottle , can and Fountain just like the first round
Now I need this but I dont know how to get Harris Teeter zero calorie Cola ?
This the reason why diet coke won't sponsor you
In turkey we call soda gazoz
I literally bought a diet coke and i opened youtube and i saw this. Lol
Other: fizzy juice - North East Scotland! Here pop is very northern English 😅
Sus
Among us
i have seen some food lion exteriors before dont know if i ever went in one though
The diet rite is older than my mom
I love your videos and the intro keep it up
Where I live the orange flavour boylans is the most popular and everyone I know loves it
I just found out that MatPat is 36
18:10 who cares what she thinks, you're looking for a new drink not her.
I actually tried diet Coke the first time just yesterday and it was pretty delicious and  best diet drink out there
The theorist have spoken, Kroger's soda is best, all hail citrus acid (vitamin C)
10 2 liters for 10 dollars at Kroger.  God I love this country
It's funny, I'm allergic to aspartame so alternative diet sodas actually work for me
Florida and Texas are not the south. They're just Florida and Texas
A, cus I'm Bri'ish
A pop

I dont like soda… i only like cola in candy form as I hate the feeling from the bubbles
pepsi max
atleast he didn't change to pepsi, PEPSI SUCKS, who wants a DISGUSTING version cocacola that is much sweeter that the sweetness makes it taste garbage not only that you might just wanna chug a gallon of water cause when i drink pepsi my mouth feels like a desert i always feel dehydrated if macdonlds switched to pepsi, *I WILL EVALUATE FROM EVERY MCDONALDS and ill cutely set it on fire 😊😊😊 and maybe ill set a care bear on fire and also watch it burn* i put it in bold to highlight it BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY A JOKE im not actually a psychopath and i would only never enter mcdonalds again
Diet Coke is my favourite. I call it pop where I am.
I go to NC annualy for vaycay and I will try the sodas that are local to y'all also I can't lie I am a jumbled mix of British and southern
D: Other (for what I called ‘sodas’)  I call them “fizzy drinks”, but I would almost always just call them by the specific brand name
I knew fountain would be the sweetest
I love Diet Pepsi😅. I drink it way too much. Just like how you drink too much Diet Coca-Cola. But I also really like the big 8 sodas
Strange that he can tell the bottle from the can when all soda cans have an interior plastic coat.
D
Mat pat is like franky from one piece
😮 try Coke Zero or pepsi
I am b and c
my name is matthew to
In a Morgan Freeman voice: little did matpat know Diet Coke would start to put citric acid in their soda
PUBLIX SODA LES GOOOOOOO!! But fun fact Publix Regular Cola tastes like RC. so really it’s Diet RC he’s drinking because They’re all bottled at the same plant as RC or smth
POP
I always say soda unless I am referring to coca cola
They forgot the best type Glass bottle coke
too bad I don't live in USA
i like sodastream because you can make it how you like but i do know people who hate that
All of the other brands will be changing the secret formally
So I'm going to go ahead a confirm that yes there IS a difference between fountain soda and can/bottle. Most of it comes from the equipment that the store uses to mix the syrup and the soda water and how often it gets cleaned.
Pop
Stopped watching as soon as Pepsi Max (rebranded Pepsi Zero) was voted out.
What do you guys think happens when you trick your pancreas into thinking you consumed a bunch of sugar when it's just empty calories? You train it over time to not produce insulin when tasting something sweet. Real sugar is unironcally less dangerous than empty sugar.
Diet tastes disgusting; and bad for your kidneys..
Boylan’s birch beer, creme soda, and root beer are my favorite on the market. Perfect for relaxing on the porch after church in the hot North Carolina summer! Their creme soda is my favorite. I’ve loved seeing Matpat come to live NC. Cookout and PDQ are fantastic as well, as I recall him bringing up NC milkshakes!
Attention Aussies Other soft drink are you with me
I never tried the diet Boylans but the regular cola is AMAZING! Now that I'm used to it, when I drink regular Pepsi or Coke it literally tastes like chemical soup, legit like chlorine. Boylans is great!
sodypop
An entire episode on Diet Coke and he still can't figure out that this is worse for his body than regular Coca-Cola
5:30 I knew the fountain one would taste better, it always does!
In South Africa we mainly call it soft drinks or fizzy drinks
Pepsi is best   pepsi is my favorite drink
Don’t drink any of this cancer forming crap.
I'm a pop guy.
Our family call it sodi
Wrong, Diet Coke is the best…
Man you can tell fountain drinks are always the best version
so did he drank fountain diet coke no stop before? i'd think fountained anything is the least consistent format out of the 3. like why is it the sweetest? this just screams unscientific from the get go
im actually drinking diet come right now, specifically caffeine free
I used to say coke because that's what my grandparents said and what I heard at restaurants, then I started drinking mountain dew and eventually diet Pepsi on a regular basis so I started calling it soda.
Softdrinks😅
Boylan does actually have other fantastic sodas. My guess is that since it's Diet Cola, they obviously didn't put cane sugar in it, and my guess is they didn't put any artificial sweeteners in it either. So.. that explains that. Highly recommend anything of theirs that ISN'T Diet!  I am slightly curious what the Diet Boylan sodas actually taste like, though. I should see if I can find some
Steph, just so you know, for as much as you hate Stevia, Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer is sweetened with Stevia.
I didn’t know Mat Pat was also from NC
On the next episode try the original coke recipe vs the current one
You'll be more shocked if you look into who bottles each of the products you judged🤣👍🍻.
In my opinion diet coke tastes horrible 😮. I've never had one that tastes good including all other available diet soda products 👎. They're all just a bad flavor representation of the original.
I'm not surprised as Kroger has some of the best Generics for EVERYTHING.
What "diet" are you on, MatPat?
Not really big on Diet drinks myself (though I do drink Caffeine free Pepsi) besides Diet Ginger Ale (I usually limit myself to two cans a day of either though depending upon what I'm having for dinner, I may only have one Pepsi or Ginger Ale), sounds like Harris Tetter or Kroger's store brand might be worth a try! Also shows that store brands can tangle with the name brands sometimes, which lets be real is probably good for you & your wallet!
Every grocery store ever: *sees Mat Pat* hey it’s the Diet Coke guy
Diet soda is a waste. Taste terrible in comparison to regular in taste. Also not better for you in anyway.
4:15 same for me, except I'm the root beer guy and I don't like diet
I work at Food Lion with a Harris Teeter down the street 💀
food lion is actually called delhaize in belgium
We call it fizzy drink in new Zealand
And this is we’re i stop watching there is no way 😡 14:35
Pepsi is be5ter
I only drink sugar Pepsi.
The theory guy
So I can verify that King Soopers, City Market and Kroger all carry the diet soda that is also carried by Harris Teeter. After having tested this it was astounding to find that you were right in that they do all have the same flavor as they are produced by Kroger
Here in the UK we call it pop
That face at 9:36 is just hilarious 😂😂
Hello fellow southerner here and yes it is universally dubbed coke that's it😂
Pop
Only OGs will remember MatPat's Obsession with diet coke
None is Australia
15:30  B, however I do have a funny story  Basically as a child I always thought the pop in pop music stood for like actual pop  When I heard of it, because my family called those kind of drinks soda, I ended up calling pop music “Soda Music” for like years and I still kinda do because I think it’s funny  Also side note, a cousin of mine calls the Poppers, never explained why
I work for Kroger in an office close by the soda and ice cream factory. I haven’t seen the labels coming off the line, but have to believe it is VERY likely HT soda is the same as Kroger’s other private label stuff.
my mom calls soda "sloppy water"
my dad LOVES Coke Zero
Other.  Coks
I thought that lion on the Food Lion brand looked so much like a store brand in my country. Apparently it's of the same group lol (Delhaize). So in my country everyone would recognize it
We don't have a Publix but we have HEB which is pretty good on most of their generics
That's your wife I thought it was your sister yall look alike
I used to call everything coke, but I switched to Soda at some point
A good food theory might be wether or not Coca Cola really uses senomyx in ther products (go search online)
A - Pop...  Also, Diet Pepsi ftw!
Man I know it's 2 years old but y'all shouldn't put forth opinions before the other tastes the drink. It ABSOLUTELY sways opinions.
19:21 Steph got that ronnigan from naruto
It makes me mad how Mat says Food Lion is only in North Carolina because we have it up here in Virginia too.
i always say sodapop as one word, so nobody gets upset at me besides the "coke" people
In Brazil, we don't have diet coke we have coke ZERO which is way better than diet in my opinion I am leaving this comment cause we ONLY have Coke ZERO Diet doesn't actually exist in Brazil
And here I thought this was about how diet soda is the worst
Stores have signature sodas?
Looking back and watching this video again makes me think Coca-Cola came up with Coke Dream or whatever that space flavored soda came from and it was just a replica of the fruity NC soda because MatPat liked it more.
O.M.G… you Didn’t pick diet cola?! MatPat you’re gone wild…😵
you are a traitor to coke
The fact that Steph mentioned Florida separately is accurate because Florida seems not of this world 😂
Nooooooo
He's also the golden freddy never existed guy and says a pokemon that literally explains the ability for dumbing it down eltric attack self and  goes Any direction why do you thunder has a 20 percent chance to hit it's impossible to hit matpat can't even read it constant it powers self with electrons in air and the very spac also this is a dimension eating pokemon does such damage it eats eltricons pikachu is straight up eating the sun
Diet Kroger brand Root Beer is my favorite pop ever.
brr i live in NC and the closest store to me is same
Food Lion. W sodas, awful work place
the only thing i drink from cola is sprite
Does anyone else call it’s dizzy brink or is that a British thing
9:37 those faces tho😂
5:04 “imaginary plastic taste” That plastic taste is not imaginary, I’ve tasted food that tastes like plastic before.
I’m not pop, soda, or coke. I’m human.
Why does it have to be diet, though? What's wrong with calories?
It's all a matter of personal taste, but my personal favourite is Vanilla Coke of any brand. Cherry Coke comes 2nd.  I'm not one for diets or worrying about my weight, so those might not be an option for diet-coke lovers.
"Soda" 🥤  -Arizona & Colorado
Diet coke is literally the worst soda ever of all time. It's simply objectively inferior to the real king, classic coke. It's not even a debate its just an objective fact, diet coke tastes like unwhiped asshole, and REAL coke is the nectar of the gods.
Nah 2023 still addicted to Diet Coke
A: pop
im soda and down in texas
#hip hip hooray matpat
Louisiana... Coke all day.
do not get in the way of mat and coke
Now I HAVE TO try Harris Teeter
the replacement for diet coke is coke zero!
Caffeine free Diet Coke is a blessing, Harris Teeter is tip-top, I ❤Food Lion and it’s called soda pop
at 9:36 I saw a smurf on the right
As someone who has family members with allergies to corn syrup and dyes I grew up with a lot of natural sodas like zevia  So stevia is a really acquired taste to put it in other words some people like it/don't mind it and others hate it My brother who has no memories of normal soda likes zevia and other all natural sodas but I who has no issues with corn starch nor dyes can't stand a lot of the sodas my brother loves   It truly depends on what you grew up eating and your specific taste buds
I can't drink diet stuff
I was thinking smth do they use different cups or do they just pour out the drinks? Because the taste of the orginal soda in the cup could alter the drinks taste
I’m not a big pop drinker.
My late friend Kathy was sugar (sucrose) intolerant. So, when we stopped to grab something to eat, I had to “play” the king’s ‘taste tester’. By the expression on my face, she knew which one it was.
MattPat, in the words of Joey Tribbanni from “Friends”, “Who’s Elaine?”.
HARRIS TEETER
POV: you drink shasta
MatPat = Mathew Pathew
What's funny is that diet coke in the UK isn't actually 0 calories. It's just less calories. That honour goes to coke zero. Although my favourite cola is 100% pepsi max (non cherry or cherry). It's not super sweet, it doesn't leave a film on your tongue like coke does, and it's quite carbonated
the diet coke that should have gone in was the one you buy the most, you will not by fountain diet coke a lot, and many of the other drinks there do not have fountain variant.
I go to obx a lot and now I want MatPat to try food lions Dr. Perky
dollar tree has an amazing soda line
Ah yes, Splenda, the healthy sweetener that almost killed me.
I love Shasta soda so I have no clue what they are on about
Little did matpat know but dr. Pepper is a cola. Also my favorite soda. So imo, he should have tried diet dp in the video.
I think we can all agree that Florida geographically is in the southeast but
YOU FORGOT GLASS BOTTLE DIET COKE
That’s why we use lemon in everything here in Mexico;)
try semancola
u missed nunu milk
pop pop pop pop pop pop
I live in the Midwest so pop is drilled into my head but I actually prefer soda.
Im B i call it soda
Do you not have PepsiMax in the USA?
Your wife look like a bitmoji
saw the title and thumbnail and thought it was a rant about why diet coke is bad for you
We always call it soda pop in va
as soon as they mentioned the fruity flavour i have been routing for harris teiter
I have a food lion on maryland
I call it drink as in  'what DRINK do you want?'
We call it a soft drink. Being a non American
Australia soft drink
Boylans makes the BEST gingerale. I didn't know anyone else knew about them.
I go with soda. As for your most liked flavor, is it possible that the flavor that you like is Dr Pepper? I haven't had Dr Pepper in many years, but I remember it having a distinctly fruity undertone. My current favorite soda isn't even a cola, though. I actually prefer Diet Sunkist orange soda.
I’m British so usually pop or coke
2023 and he is still drinking it every other GT notlive
I am a SODA/COKE/POP/SODAPOP/COLA type a guy depending on where, when, and what.
i am soda yes I now the video is 2 years old
15:33 B
Pop
The only thing better than diet coke is McDonald's diet coke.
the rock paper scissors section of the video just proves that Mat&Steph truly deserve eachother. Best couple online by far
As a diet coke drinker myself I can tell you nothing quite compares.  Also currently about a week into quitting,
The bottle one was super obvious because it was way more  carbonated,  fountain coke always tatses better... unless the mix is bad! lol
omg a earthquake just hit and it was so strong IMAO WE ALL HAD TO RUN DOWN THE 10TH FLOOR MY KNEES LOL
Cold Drink is what we call soft drinks.
I used stevia sweetener in my coffee last week and it ruined my coffee. It was so bad
pepsi max.
Pepsi max is bis
Coke + a slice of lemon is so good
Coke zero the goat
I like diet Pepsi
Every I don't  count  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Diet Coke drinkers are another breed.
We used to have a food lion near us and I live in virginia
I won’t lie, I think it’s unfair to compare them to fountain Diet Coke if the others don’t also have fountain versions
This was an awesome video! I feel like to make it more fair you should not have said which cola was which and just called them by numbers which would have been cool. Anyway I loved the video <3 definitely a comfort video of mine
18:15 or... OR ... You could've had someone else try
I like lemonade
florida is the south and we say soda
i drink stevia, at first it was as bad as jake pauls youtube videos, then it got way better. but its still not woo! matt got into hot ones
People who is other than coke, soda, pop be like : What kind of Dr. Pepper would you like ? I want coke Dr. Pepper 😂
2 years later and I'm coincidentally watching during march madness
to me this is a fail as fountain is up to the own how much water. flavour and co2 in it
Pepsi Max in Aus and UK is so much better than NA
soda
Coke
I’m in New Zealand, we have always called them by their name. In general, we call them all fizzy drinks.
I'm genuinely surprised pepsi beat even a single soda in this test, pepsi in all its forms is just nasty
Aw yay food lion, a store under the ahold delhaize umbrella (the parent company that owns regional stores across the US). We have Hannaford here in new england and have the same private brand, I always enjoy it as a cheaper alternative soda.
Diet Coke is Gross 🤢!!! Very unhealthy!
This is really (speaking like matpat) SHOCKING.
i dont htink fountain should have been valid option because stores have to mix it themselves right
I grew up with all callings of soda, yes I'm that chaotic
15:30 in my country it's kóla
15:21 both actually  my mom called it pop my father called it soda
Why is drinking a lot of diet pop bad? Everyone says that, but no one seems to know why. I'm not trying to start anything. I'm honestly curious.
Other
2 years after!
b
Only ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke
It has been exactly 2 years since MatPat quit diet coke, yay.
in canada we have cola flavoured sparkling water which is 100% your best pop replacement
Oklahoma is weird. We’re in the middle of the U.S so we say “Coke”, “soda”, “pop” and everything in between
VIDEO JUST TURNED 2!!!
In the netherlands we call them by their brand name folowed by cola for example pepsi cola, coca cola, and generic store stuff is just called cola
Soda
This video is 2 years old today
The fact that Harris teeter won is the ultimate underdog story
pepsi max better
im curious about the boylan brand, we all know old-school cola is a medical drink, originaly coca cola is wine and cocaine... this is probably what cola tasted like 100 years ago when they started using these methods
This is the true underdog tale fr
i call it fizzy
Coke. Always coke. I'd like a Dr. Pepper coke please.
I'm from the south and I say soda, but my dad says soda pop-
Mine was liquid instrument
There are food lions In Tennessee too
A
I can't believe people drink diet coke.  The aftertaste made me sick, and the main taste was pretty bland compared to regular coke. I could finally drink the sugar free coke when coke zero came.
You use to drink Diet Coke?  I always thought you were a little weird.
i call it cola
I remember when I was a kid I called Shasta shafta
interesting video...  Which seems better between PET bottle and cans tho? Also, you missed glass bottle diet coke.
fellow sun and moon show fans. sams cola. Sun and Moon Show cola.     this is a joke.
You can drink Diet Coke if you want… however much you want. No evidence it is unhealthy. So over this clownery.
Tomorrow this will be 2 years old
I’m still on Diet Pepsi.
You don't need to replace Diet Coke. You need to replace bread...
Why is Diet Coke bad for you?
I think it is a bit unfair to put a fountain soda up against the rest of the bottle ones. It also isn't practical, because you likely won't be drinking that version every day.
C Coke
Aspartame is worst for you then sugar
Pepsi light for me but I drink it occasionally
I um diet papce guy but i want to sray the froty cota and don't gaeg me um not engleas okey??
I called my soda the great obese
I’m definitely wanting to try the Harris Teeter cola now. Should probably get some on my way home
Pop is what I call I live in BC Canada
Soda.
SODA!!!
You're fired. MatPat, get out. We're replacing you with the Diet Coke-loving robot, "AutoPat."
Diet Coke is the worst drink know to man. @me
I quit drinking Diet Coke religiously (I could fight Matt to see how much money we've given the corporation over the years) when I learned how the cows at the Fair Life farms are treated. Spoiler: they live far from a fair life. Diet Pepsi was my immediate go to and at this point I like it more.
shasta literally mean cheap in hindi... i do not know who came up with this name! 😄
Why diet? So. Gross.
Soft drink
I never even started 😂
Isnt aspartame like the most tested/studied sugar substitute? I havent seen any evidence of it being bad?
I worked at Whole Foods for a summer, and HOLY CRAP THEY HAVE THIS REGULAR CHERRY COLA THAG IS SO GOOD. The cherry cola is sweetened with cane sugar tho, so it’s not stevia, which is good as I’m not a stevia fan.
bet they were peeing a lot after filming that 😁
I’m a bit cranky that you compare a fountain drink Diet Coke vs canned or bottled versions of everything else. Unfair advantage.
I wouldn't recommend the home made diet coke I would recommend the Dr pepper version though. I promise you that Dr pepper is way better homemade soda than that gross favor but it is just my opinion and my family's mainly me and my younger siblings.
Here in NZ we call it fizzy not pop, soda or coke e.g what kind of fizzy do you want
Idk what south she grew up in but we just call it by whatever the name of the soda is
My phone glitched out and so the timstamps from the nirvana deep discog dive so I was so confused when I saw “In Utero” as one of the time stamps 💀😭
We called it "Soda Pop" growing up in south central Kansas (mostly drinking Coca Cola and 7 Up made with real sugar in those days).
I don't drink soda because it's a whole texture thing and it's the way I was brought up. But there's a single soda in my life that has my heart, and that is cream soda. I remember drinking it once during a sports day in like the 5th grade and it is honestly the best thing I've ever tasted, and it still is. Make a video on all the cream soda brands you guys can find it would be very much appreciated for someone who would probably give up trying. Love yall!
This is kinda sad, "which poison will take my life over?" Everyone seems to love having more harmful chemical's in their day to day. Like you don't have enough problems, lets add health issues on top.
Kroger soda has always been the best
I was a hardcore diet coke drinker for years. Been drinking only water for the last 4 years and i can tell you that it is probably for the best decision healthwise. It is more boring though
one thing you shouldn't forget is what the artificial sugar does in your system...
I'm a ride or die for Harris Teet's diet coke
I actually really like the diet Shasta, all the hospitals I have worked at have them and their ginger ale is on point too
There is nothing unhealthy about diet soda
I get disappointed at how much food the world & specificaly the US waste. Can you do a video on that if you haven't already? Like what happens to the food when restaurants mess up your order, what happens to the food people never pick up that they ordered, how much leftovers are left over on restaurant tables (I've seen untouched & more than half a plate left over before. I'm sure it's thrown away. But how much of it? What is it's cost & how can that be prevented? Does it affect the environment too?) How does retail stores handle expired food? - from experience I know even it's one day past the "best by" label it gets scanned out & thrown away, often "destroyed" so no one can get it (like hungry homeless people because of greedy corporate people who don't want to give away free, "expired", still safe to eat food). Also, talk about best by vs expiration date labels vs other dates. Sometimes they're there just to make shelf space for new stuff & have companies make profit, right? Like water & honey won't expire or go bad in just 2 years like the date says. Anyway, there's so much more...
In australia we call them fizzy drinks🥹
c, coke
Loads of people have to agree that the food theory intro is better than the rest

A: pop
Team "Fizzy Drink"
well done, you will probably save yourself $5000 a year
I usually say Soda or Soft Drink
Love that I’m watching this a year later as March Madness is starting again.
So sad you should really try out me and my RC
Matpat: kicks out all the special flavored colas Also matpat: proceeds to choose harris teeter because of its special flavor    Cherri Coke: 😔
The would probably be a better test if they weren't told what the match ups were before they tasted. It makes it much less of a blind test.
That's is so extremly bizarre
Bro you have to remake this video this year
This is better than a wine tasting. Imagine Aliens for whom any cola is pure poison watching this.
Why is this the 2nd video on my FYP today that talks about diet-coke addictions? I don`t even drink Diet Coke!
im coke
I am the zevia version of matpat, I have wayyy, wayyy to many cans of zevia rootbear everyday
Diet coke tastes like plastic
Quit diet coke? I gave up dark sodas for like two decades. Liteweight.
Used to drink a lot of diet pepsi because I drank way too much regular pepsi and was trying to replace it. Then I tried diet DrPepper and there was no looking back.
im addicted to Pepsi max ngl
As a Delawarean, yes do know what food lion is
the after taste of diet drinks is so disgusting, how can he drink so much? ew
Pop all day my man
For me I grew up on a b and c because I first lived in Texas with coke and soda but now I live in Nebraska with pop
Pepsi Zero, easy
bro I thought it was pepsi max not pepsi zero sugar
Sody water
Spindriff you are welcome
i know about food lion lol
B
I am a diabetic type 1 and I like coke Zero it still has that coke taste
Vanilla Coke reigns supreme for me. The canned variety specifically. Nothing else compares.
Wow! Do you guys still live in North Carolina? Been meaning to move there myself, and I’ve been surprised by how many people from YouTube I’ve noticed living there! Also, I wonder if you guys have done an episode on which sweeteners are the healthiest. I know this is probably a loaded topic with lots of variables like who’s consuming it, but I’m a prediabetic and have learned that a lot of my friends and family, including in South America, are diabetic. So just putting it out there, and thanks for the episode! 🙂☺️
Love pop
The correct term is soda and what ive always called it.
Man she is so hot. For southern red neck nerd girl next-door she is a 8/10. Hot darn diddly. 😩

weird branding differances but pepsi zero sugar is called "pepsi max" in the uk, and "coke with splenda" is just called "coke no caff". also ik they're just doing diet soda's and not Diet soda's with added flavouring, but in googling to check that pepsi zero sugar and pepsi max are the same product, i found out that Cherry pepsi max just isn't sold in america, whcih is wierd because here it's like.. the 2nd most popular cola, behind diet coke (british people are cheapskates and coca cola is expensive so it got bumped to like 4th)
15:30 I like the most kofola. It's a soda drink established in former czechoslovakia, as an alternative to western cola drink due to the soviet union at the time.
Fried   V.
I love Kroger diet cola lol I’m glad I’m not the only 😂
Just get pepsi it is delicious 🤤
B, soda just sounds better than pop
i say softdrink or soda
Diet Coke is disgusting..
I've been drinking Big K sodas since I was a kid. I'm a Root Beer and fruit soda kind of guy, who's lived all over the country, and the Kroger brand has always been among the best tasting and cheapest options.
I just really wish there were more options that were both diet and caffien free and tasted good. I've always HATED anytihng diet, I just can't stand that weird chemical aftertaste but I decided that I HAD to start doing something about my caffine intake and weight I needed a replacement for my full calorie drinks. While not the best option (water), I ended up landing on caffine free diet Pepsi and caffine free diet Mtn. Dew. I've always been team Pepsi but after watching this video, I'll be stopping by Harris Teeter to see if they have a caffiene free diet option.
Try water. It's pretty dope.
I drink Kroger’s zero calorie cola, and it definitely beats out all of the other diet/zero cal options for me.
not trying to be negative more genuine curiosity, why was the video res so bad on this video? All of their gt live content is like perfect 1080p this is like 720, idk just feels weird.
I'm Soda
I've always been a Diet Dr. Pepper boy
Fun fact : Food lion is actually a Belgian grocery store named "Delhaize"... I wonder if their diet coke is the same in Belgium and in the US :D
I just realised that matt and steff were never told what coles were because it can actually affect your brain and how it actually tastes
Team pop
Pop for sure
It's funny cuz diet cola is so much worse for you then regular soda
This ain't a food theory. its drink theory.
Are you still off the diet coke bandwagon, or have you jumped onto Tetter Harris bandwagon?
DID MATPAT JUST CHOOSE A GROCERY STORE DIET-COLA OVER the DIET COKE?!!!!!!!!!111!1!11111!!!11!
in our country we mostly call it soft drink
me personaly A:pop
I didn't realize Matpat lived in my state. That's pretty cool! I also do my shopping at Harris Teeter because it's the most convenient trip from my place (and the place I lived before that too).
Who new 2 years later I would be watching this in March whilst March Madness is happening.
The rock paper scissors part is really wholesome you'll know they are meant for each other.
If boylan used the same recipe 100 years ago, maybe there's still meth inside?
In South Africa it's cold drink which is pronounced as codrink
In Australia we say "fizzy"
14:25 did you see that flashed diet cola vs another drink?
Soda
Dude, seeing all those plastic bottles... Could you make a video about microplastics contaminating food and drink in modern day life? And the potential side effects that occur on the endocine system.
Pop
we call any kind of soda here "softdrinks"
His nasally voice and constant sniffling is gross and annoying. Sorry - cannot watch.
The amount of money Matpat saves now by drinking Harris insted of coke adds up pretty quick if he ofc drinks a lot which i think he does (I mean can you blame me the man loves his diet cokes) xD
Here in Estonia we call all fizzy non-alcoholic drinks lemonades no matter their flavour - the word is "limonaad".   Has no connection to lemons either, a lemon is "sidrun".
nope
15:28 D: I just call out the drinks by their name
3:46 turn on captions here and it says what you think matt said
Not Sure what "seeded" means in terms of rankings, seated sure but "seeded"? 😂
Did he really give up Diet Coke?
Pop
oh god you reminded me of coca cola life, tasted absolutely horrible, it's like they didn't taste test the product before putting it on the shelves
Coke connoisseur
Soda WHO Are you man 15:39
Mat you should try Kofola its a czech and slovakian exclusive but its really good
I call soda fizzy drink #UK
Matt pat Oh this is my dream episode All the dentist watching It's not Just no!!!!!
I hate that zevia lost so early. I stockpile this stuff. No sugar or calories or any added crap. Healthiest for you and you can even drink it while fasting. And to me it tastes just like cola
Harris teeter diet soda sales went off the charts in 2022
Why diet?
I am from South Dakota and never seen any of the stores that were shown on the Kroger's list lol
Team "Soda-Pop!"
pop and soda midwest baby wisconsin
Here in Iowa it's a weird mix of pop and soda cause a lot of people from the south move to iowa
Should've been called Mat's Madness
Soda😊😊
15:33 fizzy drinks (coca cola, fanta, pepsi), cos uk
I have always been Sodie Pop - Mid/southern Missouri
Here is a song that we did in Music once: Diet Cola Caffeine free, it matters not to me, let’s see wich is the best one, Coke, or Pepsi, Coke Pepsi Coke Pepsi Coke (2, 3, 4) Coke Pepsi Coke Pepsi Coke (2, 3, 4)
For the Zevia, I don't know if you had it refrigerated before you used it. They taste much better when they are refrigerated instead of at room temperature.
I do have two questions from this video that I think might be worth considering:  1. Over a year later, does the fruity twist of the store-brand coke still stand up against the other two titans or was it being carried by it's freshness? 2. Regarding the initial vote before the bracket truly began, does the container of the coke liquid (fountain vs plastic vs can) affect the liquid via contaminants? Coke is an acidic drink after all so it would make sense if it were to mix some of the contents of the container into the liquid itself. Which would then bring up the question as to what those contaminants might do to your body.
15:32 as a kid i called carbonated soft drinks as "Cactus Juice" or "Spiky Juice"
D:other We just call it by the branded name in britan
Mat Pat loves Diet Coke more than Scott Pilgrim
B
I use both soda and pop randomly. In my mine they’re exactly the same
I call it popity pop pop soda pop coke pop
For the poll: Pop
I just learned Matpat lived in the Midwest and moved to North Carolina which is exactly what I am doing. Also I call it soda lol
Well that didnt age well lmao
I say soda but my family all say pop. Soda is just a more fun word
i love soda too
For me i call soda fizzy drinks
Happy to see Steph in an episode!
I love the Sans in Ness theory.
My favorite is Coke Zero and actually Vanilla Coke Zero but that one is almost a dessert for me haha
14:15 Steph apologizing to Johnny Ryan coke is so adorable.
Soda
coke🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Im soft drink
Diet Coke is just regular coke watered down, just sayin
Oh I live in North Carolina.
I don’t drink diet sodas but myself and my family do drink regular soda, sprite and “orange Fanta.” I always buy the Kroger brand of sodas and my kids like them better than the name brand and I do too for the price. They are 4/$5 where I live. We get the soda, lemon lime and orange soda, Kroger brand every time and they all taste similar if not better than the name brand soda.
i know it as cola
Wow Harris Teeter and Food Lion. I used to live in NC, and those names bring me back. Granted, I didn't usually shop at Food Lion cuz it was a bit, uh..., ghetto..
Thats like whole foods 365 chicken is actually perdue which is sold in many other grocery stores
Hmmm a little sus... hates whole foods but loves harris teeter... hmmm
Red coat,,, just like Star Lord 8-)
we only by store brand and it is soooooooooo god
i know who you are you are my enemy my enemy you are my enemy wecome to the new age to the new age to the new age
Harris Teeter sales after this video, stonks
RC diet would have won in an landslide
I mostly drink water, but I keep a lot of different sodas in the fridge for visitors to help themselves. The soda that they choose the most? DietCoke. 3 to 1!
Tuk kroge
im a B
Who’s watching in match madness 2023
News flash he still loves diet coke
Dr. Perky from food lion is another amazing off brand.
In Australia, we call it soft drinks 🥤
I'm a year late but Boylan soda really doesn't taste that great period and I don't chug soda. I was excited when I saw they had a Shirley Temple flavor and it's gross.
What even is cola? Like where's the flavour come from
Coincidentally, I am watching this in March
Came back here to comment that I'm pretty sure this video has been rendered moot and he's back to drinking Diet Coke. At least that's what he's been saying in recent videos.
in new orleans we call those “soft drinks” … why are they soft?
I wish I could stand 'Diet' products so that I could fully appreciate this video.
My mom said that Diet Soda has an artificial sweetener that can cause cancer
Ok fashionably late to this video but I’m from Australia and we all call it fizzy drink even if your young or old 😂
I am from North Carolina!
18:01 he called Harris Teeter 13th seed but its labeled as 10th seed.............
Normally pop but rarely soda
Jesus you guys look like brother and sister
I think I saw Giant in the brands owned by Kroger. I'm absolutely going to try their diet cola now. Also anyone who doesn't see Steph and Matt Pat as couple goals is wrong. 🥰
wow! 😄
COKE
my instant reaction:NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WERE IS THE RC IT IN NC AHHHHH
I tried the soda and it's mid
Wait is Pepsi Max called Pepsi Zero in the States???
Coke Zero
same
Pop
Steph is right: Coke Zero >>>>>>  However, gonna have to try kroger diet cola now
Honestly the thing I'm surprised about most in this video is finding out that Harris Teeter and Food Lion aren't nationally recognized grocery stores.
I’m from nc so every time he says “you probably don’t know this” i say haha silly matpat
did he use diet pepsi?
I know this is late but they should try “me and my rc”
I love Food Lion stuff and it hurt me when you said “you probably don’t know about.” 🥲  (Yes, I know about food lion. I live in MD. I went to one last week.)
Generic/store brands are the same as big brands, similar to the big 3 companies making every flat screen tv or monitor on the planet. With Soft Drinks, the big brands will recalibrate their machines in between shifts or cleaning and the soda's that continue to come out aren't properly balanced, so they label them as something else and sell it anyway to keep waste to an absolute minimum and to maximize profits.
These mofos are so cute
coke was never the same since they took the cocaine out
WOW.JUST WOW.
zevia is gross
D
I call it can I pls have  another 3😂😂😂
B: soda
Shasta is the mental hospital soda 😭 when I was there we all went nuts over it and praised the Shasta gods
Its soda
Green Cola is the Best
Diet soda is only 1 chemical stage less than embalming fluid.
Mine is "soft drinks"
I'm a pop guy. I also say soda. On rare occasion I'll even say fizzy drink or soft drink. Test me.
Idea:go to Texas and head to a HEB  and buy each Heb version of popular sodas, for example: dr.b (basically dr.pepper but Heb[wasn't dr.pepper made in texas?])
I MAY or may not be biased BUT dr. pepper solos all 💁🏼‍♀
bro just quit his coke addiction
I’m other I call coke carbonated dark liquid with a specific number of caffeine.
No please don’t quit Diet Coke you are they cooking since I was six
15:28 I just say "fizzy drink" mostly because I don't like fizzy drinks lmao
It’s pop, always has been pop, always will be pop.
Fanta is created by Coca-Cola use with Fanta now
Coke 💀💀💀
D. In the UK we just call it by the drink name, but if we had to give a specific name then probably A
Diet Pepsi
I’m pop
Awesome video, as usual! Gonna add a different side to the statistics: soda would be second to my actual default name that I use for these, soft drinks.
I switched to Kroger’s Double Oh Cola, which is their version of Coke Zero. It’s is the best “private label” diet soda on the market. It used to be 59¢ then 88¢ and now $1.25. It still cheaper than Coke and Pepsi products. I bet the same version is sold at Harris Teeter.
i love kroger brand soda i live for it
team soda
Try rubicon
i would lake to try this with energy drinks, see if i can taste out my favourite brand or find a new favourite, but i am kinda concerned for my health if i have to drink that many energy drinks.......

I found "citric acid" in a small local pacistani grocer. My life has never been the same! I add it to Everything,Candy,Tea ,soda & most every Chicken recipe. It comes in a powder form ( more like a fine sugar granuel form).Be carefull it is very addictive. Locally try many an Indian grocer, but be carefull about asking anyone from India about "ACID" Let them know it is for cooking.
Cmoooooon give Pepsi a chance
Not gonna lie I prefer Pepsi to coca cola, I think coca cola tastes like vegetables
Can you pls do a co cane in Coca Cola
Did you look at the store brands and where they are made. They may be the same. The regional stores aren't making their own sodas.
when Steph said she doesnt like stevia it reminded me of lydia from breaking bad who looks and sounds similar to her but lydia likes stevia.
Harris yeeter
Diet gross.
no way i can see him without diet coke
OMG Stephs face at 20:53
Ok I understand having a fav fav fav soda,but DIET Coke
Food Lion is here in south Carolina to
Coke😅
DOCTER PEPPER IS SUPIRRIOR TO ALL
North Carolina take your shirt off swing it around your head like a helicopter
The thumbnail made me grab a coke 😂
Coke
Sam's regular cola is good
Sam's cola is superior
No more diet  coke
soda mostly
My Grandparents always buy Diet Rite whenever we come over so I can easily recommend it, it’s pretty good
Pop
freeway cola zero from lidl
9:40 Stevia works well in baking or cooking... but in drinks I can NOT stand the taste or the effect.  Personally pepsi max/zero is my preference at home, but I'll drink diet coke all day long out of the fountain...
I feel like u should of just not told them which is which after they picked and just told them at the finals
No it can't be noooooo
Soft drink  and cold drink
A
No game has this fine woman drinking Diet Coke, I’d have her sipping champagne in first class.
Wouldn't the fruity aftertaste of the Harris Teeter cola put it into the category of colas with flavoring added because of the addition of citrus acid? I think canned Cherry Coke Zero would pimpslap Harris Teeter if it entered that category!
Legit, I was inspired by this video. SHOCKINGLY the Kroger root beer (my beverage of choice) won out over everything else, including my former favorite root beer brand. So, I am inclined to belive that when it comes to drinks, Kroger is shelling out the good stuff
18:11 why does she have a say? Isn't this all to choose one for him?
In Israel we just call them all Gazoz or Mugaz (gassy, as in carbonated)
I say beverage and it drives people nuts
gotta drink can outta can first sip go crazy but fountain good too
Soda pop is what I always called it
pop btw
sun drop
Carbonated water ftw
Lidl
I hate Coke-Cola and pepsi
Pepsi is way way way way better then coke  …. Read more
MatPat PLEASE make a video reviwing just regular soft drinks (soft drink if how we say soda in australia) (totally not me trying to convince you to try the italian soft drink "Chinotto" which is the defenition of "you either love it or you hate it. there is no inbetween". I'm half italian and a lot of my Italian relatives do not like it. the others (including me) love it. if you wanna know what it tastes like click "read more" but if you wanna try it with a suprise dont read more.   it tastes like a mix between really bitter orange juice and coke, with a sweet aftertaste. ima copy and paste a really bad review then a really good review.  "Chinotto is baffling. Deeply bitter, darkly colored, and too lightly carbonated, I can't stomach the liquid for long enough to find any complexity in its flavors." and the good review is  "Chinotto the beverage is refreshingly bitter—but not so much so that you can't drink it like a soda. It has an intense, warm fragrance of cinnamon and clove and the sourness of rhubarb, quince, and grapefruit (that is, all of my favorite fruits)."
And soda is the way to say it in the south
Diet anything is so awful for u
If you ever visit pa there is a cola here that I love called reading draft you can also see it on the website were you showed the boylan
This would be great to do again but blind with no names attached during the taste test
I’m still drinking Diet Coke cause I can’t have the sugar one :)
switch to pepsi
glass bottle best
I quit Coke Zero and switched to zevia
Carb seems to be a good in between soda and pop.
Carb seems to be a good in between soda and pop.
when i tried to give up alcohol. diet coke kept me sane. then 6 months later i use it in whiskey instead of regular coke lmao....
I love the way you two test sodas like they are fine wine--fruity aftertaste, etc. I'm glad I found your channel!
Stevia is disgusting!
I only call soft drinks "coke" when I spend my summer with my Mimi in Texas It's slipped through a couple of times where I've said "it smells like coke in here" when I was in a place that generally said soda  Funny story, when my parents met, my dad asked  "Do you want some coke?"  As he pulled out a soft drink  My mom thought he was taking out COKE not the soft drink  She almost started yelling at him
Nothing beats Vanilla Coke, you can NOT convince me other wise
Coke Zero was good. Coke Zero sugar, not so much
Lol likes the  fountain coke it's the molded diet coke machine
Never.
here in quebec we say liquor for soda
I'm from the Midwest, but I call it soda
23:12 f in chat for my fellow brits
18:58 ohhh she so cheated lmao she was going for rock them changed to paper
I have been watching this for a while these two belong to each others. I wish I could find my significant other…..yeah right lol
B: I Say soda
i prefer diet dr.pepper. and im pretty sure that diet dr.pepper with a little mango syrup is the best soda ever. but that just an opinion, a food opinion.
I recently tried Boylan's Root Beer and had the exact same reaction you two did to the Diet Cola. I was very disappointed but oh well, it's not for everyone.
but I am D: other - I call it disgusting.
15:26 Yes, I like coke!...
Here Kroger sells Big K soda at the local Smiths grocery, and it is delicious.
2:15 We call that a stack of teams
Why not quit the entier soda and move to water.
Soft drink
Caffeine free and diet ... WHY BOTHER !
Steph looks very nice in this vid !
My family call them (this is in malay) bergas
my country calls all soda pepsi
As someone who also lives in NC I never heard of Harris teeter cola
It's not a theory it's an addiction
It’s now different guys
Im not sure for other people but my family call pop or soda, fizzy
Yeah almost everyone around here calls it coke I prefer soda I've also rarely heard cola and pop
"hi im done with coke, im doing math instead" 🤣

Was anyone else drinking Diet Coke while watching this or is it just me🤨
It call  soda pop
You know what...I've always been a Coke Zero fan and I knew something was wrong with it but my sister told me they just changed the packaging...I should have known😑😑😑😑  I haven't bumped into diet coke though🤔
Make your own... by mixing the two favorites together!
Forget R.P.S. Just flip a coin or roll die for judgement (RPG much???)
I myself, have become a generics believer; HEB has a tastier soda than a LOT of name brands! Good call, Mat!
10:25 apparently aspartame also causes cancer (not directly but im assuming it doesnt help it in anyway)
Here we call it "sumo" which translates to juice, so everything is juice except for tea, coffee and water lmao
For your health’s sake, steer clear of “Diet”.  Aspartame is a known migraine trigger.  The “diet” soda’s actually end up getting you to drink _more_ soda than if you just had a bottle of regular.
His intelligence comes from the diet coke
Mine saying coke is so weird it's kola
I dont think I am but am I the only one that dont say soda or pop rather I say the "soda´s" name instead. since I was little either called it by its colors or the brand name.
Theres no way for me to ever just go to Harris teeter. I am in the Netherlands. But if I ever were to go to Harris teeter I will try that specific cola.
Diet dr pepper
14:39 *Me who works at food lion* 👁️👄👁️
Coke 100%, pop sounds off.
holy muffin
We im germany don't say: pop,coke or soda, we say "sprudel" which means fizzy drink
3:45 best part of the video
Dillon's brand pops are pretty good. Though I haven't tried their root beer.
A:pop 1000000000%
I’ve never tried the diet but the other Boylan I’ve had has been amazing.
Where do I get the red jacket tho
I have always swapped between saying pop and soda.
Hate Diet Soft Drinks, impressed by y'all's objectiveness
Not related comment but are u cousins
Move to a country where they still sell Tab.
diet coke has pretty much died over here in Australia and been replaced by Coke Zero (probably because it tastes a lot closer to original coke)
Serious question who hasn't heard of food lion?
im b
In Central Ohio, I decided at a young age to quit calling it "pop" like everyone else, & begin calling it the CORRECT term, "soda".
Matepad if you are choosing why step with you you can choose your favourite
its amazing how often matt looks at the camera
Soda but do you say coke a cola if you want what we just say coke in a restaurant
I don't know if its just me, but I live in GA and I only know the Food Lion to sell meat, so I was pretty surprised
B
Liquid death lime flavor and CBD seltzers
Coke zero is better
huh
Pepsi zero sugar is my favorite soda
he quit coke
It’s zero coke
I was 4 at 2020
I call it SOE-DE
Dude loves coke more than Stephanie
why is anyone even drinking Coke, Fanta etc? The regular/non-diet ones had sugar drastically reduced - it's just flavoured water with artificial sweeteners. And that's what it tastes like. There's nothing to it. It has driven me to start drinking fruit juice, water and other healthy crap, but at least  that crap is enjoyed with the amount of sugar it's meant to have - or, like in the case of water - it's absence where that is again natural and OK.   But why would anyone want to drink coke *or insert any brand* - Zero / Lite / Diet? Why would you actually spend money, or any kind of effort to acquire it and then ingest it?
You’re always going to be fighting against human anatomy. If your body tastes something sweet it will produce insulin. If there’s no sugar to break down eventually it will lower insulin production, and then you will have diabetes.
Other
not food oems xD
Bebsi. Thats us.
Since he has moved I am curious what he found to replace Harris Teeter! I am going to try out more of my local store branded sodas now.
I live in NC as well! My mother drinks as much Diet Coke as MatPat does!
Boylan Cola?  Hmm, maybe It tasted like cough syrup due to the accidental discovery of it being a beverage when it was originally supposed to be medicine 🤔 No wonder it's compared to cough syrup.
They’re trying to make Homer Simpson’s cough syrup, drink, Fleming, Mo
Pepsi Zero just reinvented their soda and it’s delicious
In Australia Pepsi Zero Sugar is called Pepsi Max and the thing at the top of the can says ‘Max Taste. No Sugar.’
I am shocked !   I don't see Diet Pepsi on your collection.   Diet Coke is watery, in ice it really gets watery.  NO diet drink is as good as Diet Pepsi !   NONE !
Coke is meant to be a fountain drink and have ice added so fountain puts it's best foot forward. Pepsi, for example, is terrible as a fountain drink but a cold can of pepsi has a better taste than a cold can of coke. (hence the major wins in blind taste tests of the 90s)
Stop drinking soda all together.  Even without the sugar the carbonation in soda and carbonated beer eats away your teeth and destroys your gut bacteria.
i call all lemon lime soda "sprite" and every cola "coke" and so on and so forth
Citric acid is just in so many things for a ton of reasons. It's also the reason I can't have pretty much anything that's "all natural" because they always choose citric acid as their acid of choice (even though vinegar is RIGHT THERE). (I'm super allergic to citric acid...)
its pop coke soda or all of the above im all of the above
Wow you tried an awful lot of cokes in this video, Mat. An awful lot.
best cokesare from bottles, but glas ones.
Fyi, products being made in the same factory and marketed as different brands isn't exclusive to food. I work in a pharmacy and some of the branded and generic medications are exactly the same, in different boxes. Not all of them mind you, some use the same active ingredients but different inactive ones, so be sure to ask your pharmacist if you know you have allergies. For the same reason, try different generic brands too, if you're not finding the one you're using too effective (I find this with one of my migraine meds). You could be saving a lot of money by doing this! (Favourite example is panadol [Americans call it acetaminophen]: brand-name for 96 tablets will be about $15-$20. Generic brand for 100 tablets is $2-$3. The generic tablets are round and not quite as easy to swallow, but if you don't have trouble with that, it's an amazing about of money to be saving)
it's a bit extra that those two are standing up to not just diet coke but fountain diet coke. That's like the best diet coke. I guess you didn't specify if it was generic fountain or mcdonalds fountain either.
I’m other. My family and I are psychopaths who refer to them as “Soft Drinks.”
video's good, but it'd be a much fairer comparison if the contenders weren't revealed after each round, since no explicit biases would come about that way

I live in Canada and I call it pop.
actually in canada for this kind of "no brand" thing we have something call "no name",, but no name is actually not just food,, its pretty much everything you could imagine

As far as i now food lion is a subsidiary of a Belgian supermarket chain cald Delhaize. I am mesion this because i didn't now that this supermarket operated in the US and my Belgian pride.
Honestly this comment might get a lot of hate but I hate Diet Coke. I just can't help taste the fake sugar.
Missed opportunity that they didn’t include Inca Cola
Matpat: *makes a video of a diet coke taste test and food lion was the winner.*  Me who lives in Hampton Roads part of Virginia: you have given me a great opportunity to follow in your footsteps, fellow Matt. (Yes, we have the same IRL name. Coincidence, yes. That's it, no other meaningful reference. It's a joke.)
Coke, as in what type of coke do you want?
Boylan birch beer is delicious. I am from Oregon, so I never heard of it until I moved to Pennsylvania, and I absolutely love it. I know that isn't what the bracket is about, just wanted to throw it out there. And Shasta Lemon-Lime is vile, don't drink it. And being from the Pacific Northwest I grew up calling it pop, but after being stationed down south I started calling it soda, and it stuck ever since. You two are clearly married, you share a brain at rock-paper-scissors.
Either fizzy drink or pop in Britain. Depends where you are.
Soda
It's all simple. Just switch to kvas.
Boyla is still using the cocaine😂

Difficult reaching this episode, 2 year relationship ended and they quickly moved on
diet sodas always seem funny to me. It does have a semi-normal taste. HOWEVER, there is an aftertaste to it that is not good, at least in my opinion.

If you are looking for a delicious soda, i would recommend any orange drink.
anyone here who ever tasted Tab X-tra? it was the Norwegian version of Tab and was sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland and was Coca Colas answer to Pepsi Max, i remember it well... its bottle was a unique very hard plastic bottle that when recycled was not crushed and remade to new bottles, they washed the bottle and used it again leading to bottles getting a rather worn look and very easy to identify recycled vs newly produced bottles, and the soda itself... it tasted good innitially as you got it in your mouth, but befor you where even able to swallow the only taste you would be able to feel was a rather distastefull strong taste of chemical artificial sweetener that would last long after forcing yourself to swallow the soda and a little bit of your own vomit as you no doubt woul vomit a little due to the strong chemical artificial sweetener after taste making the next mouthfull that much harder to endure, some people really liked it though and the soda lasted for 13 years (1994-2007 in Sweden and Finnland and a hard to understand 27 years (1994-2021) in Norway.  and i think it could be a fun video where they taste test Diet Colas from other countries.

When he was describing Harris Teeter, Stephanie's face is hilarious
Is Matt from Michigan?? He called Kroger 'Krogers'  I'm probably stupid, and have been looking way too closely into Michigan accents
I used to have a food lion, but it got replaced with a stupid Weis.
Don't you guys have Pepsi Max? It's just the best

Oh look. Another promo for Diet Coke. It’s not like you made it obvious. Seriously I like you but you’re not Chris Evans or some other famous actor. So why would I drink it because of some YouTube person? Some of you aren’t humble at all, Most sell out.

15:04 Coke and Pepsi both have 2 sodas out he says yet Pepsi has to lose one to go any further
also if it wasn't the diet versions Sam's Cola would dance on the other sodas graves.
15:29 I say "carbonated soft beverage made commonly with corn syrup of which that keeps my caffeine levels above average" or if someone says "what the #### are ya talking about?" then I just say "soda"
I watched this whole thing while drinking a bottle of offbrand cola.
This is what happens when coke doesn’t sponser him for over a decade with free promotions

We call it soft drink or fizzy drink in Australia
They changed it to ‘coke no sugar’ here, which is awful. I call it Coke Zero but sometimes a shop person will pretend not to know what I mean. Don’t you have pepsi max? That must be what pepsi zero is there?
Why didn’t Coke Zero win😤🤬

In Canada we just call it pop or the brand name i never heard anyone say soda.
I am curious if MatPat has stuck with this
As a Canadian I like to describe a pop\soda\coke as a "fizzy drink" but I'll sometimes call it by it's brand name if I want something specific.  Edit: When it was a match-up between Diet Coke and Harris Teeter, you said 13th seed when on the screen it said 10th seed. Just wanted to point that out.

Pepsi is my favorite soda of all time Coke is my second favorite. It just doesn’t have that feel that I get when I drink Pepsi when I drink Pepsi, I feel very like energetics and happy but that’s not the same for a cola all I feel like is weird that’s like when I drink it. I feel weird but doesn’t mean I don’t like it. I love it.

In the northwest you say coke Pepsi the name of it or soda so unsubcribed
Citric acid is also a favorite Chemical for industrial purposes. Pretty sure both are the same form of citric acid used to clean massive machinery as goes into Diet Coke lol.

shasta tastes too much like bubblegum and feel like fireworks. Shasta cola = F tier. change my mind.
As someone who has lived in the south almost all of my life  I’ve never heard any soda aside from coke referred to as coke
I’m from Australia and we call it soft drink 😂 all that stuff is very American to us
D: Cola
Late to the game but I will admit, Used to work in a grocery dairy department, when the milk arrived, there would be the name brand, the "competitor brand" and the store brand all on the same truck from the same dairy plant
no way.. regular diet pepsi is my main fix.
I don't drink a lot pop for any brand. It is fun to learn. Good work on the video.
I hate stevia as alternative sweetener due to it's distinct taste which just feel so out of place.
He should do a book theory channel
I was so excited to see Boylan on the list. Never had the diet cola though, I like the root beer and birch beer.
4:52 my phone Froze on this screen for Like around 20 and i Just tought he was taking a lot of time to taste It lmao
Most people who use stevia are people who want sugary stuff but have diabetes    Or atleast thats me and my mom

I like foxon park and jones brand soda
My dad is so similar he drinks like 5 litres of Coke Zero a day
im surprised that haris teter took out diet coke. and that he quit diet coke for all of 2020
B soda
I have a bad experience with sodas myself. I used to drink it all the time, mainly Coke, and by the time I reached 50, I had lost almost all my teeth. I currently have 3 teeth left. I blame it on all the sugar, but there's also the carbonation which works like acid to soften the teeth, making it easier for the sugar to get in there and create cavities. Although diet sodas don't have the sugar that regular sodas do, I've heard that diet sodas are actually worse because some of the artificial sweeteners have been linked to causing health problems themselves. I only drink water now.  Also, I grew up in Iowa where it is called pop, but I moved to Tennessee later in life and here they call everything coke or cold drink. It was confusing. I just call it soda now.
she sits like a serial killer
Court case: Coca cola says it's unfair since he said no flavor but the winner had citric acid
3:47 look at the subtitles
Just wanna say, it is NOT universally called Coke in the south. North Carolina is a strongly Pepsi-aligned state, so often you don’t even have Coke products available at fast food and even some dine in restaurants. You definitely won’t call all drinks Pepsi though! Even in North Cackalacky, most folks are asking for a Coke or a Sprite before they ask for a Pepsi or a Sierra Mist.
Matt patt’s name be like:MAttmas Pattamas
No surprise Boylan tasted like cough syrup. It kept its original recipe for 100 years, aka from a time when soda was made more for medicinal purposes than regular drinking

The fact that Mat and Steph tied so many times in a row with rock paper scissors is both hilarious and incredibly wholesome.
Yes I love all cokes especially diet coke ❤🎉  your my child my precious child on my team
I am personally, if yet, one of those people who grew up with, like somebody saying like what you ordering some pop other people saying, oh, you want to drink them, so I'm kind of like pop and soda person. I've never heard of like people calling it bright lemon lime cola, cause that's the dumbest thing I will hurt if I did here, but I've never heard that
I've never had Boylans diet coke, but i've had their rootbeer and it's amazing. It's definetly my everyday drink
Matpat: makes this video Harris teeter stocks: *Stonks*
Compare this to dr pepper, trust me. It’s the best. Try them all, diet, normal, and 0. They all taste the same though
7:48, moxie in a nutshell
Dr pepper zero sugar is best
So I'm from a place that's not north Carolina and I have food lion and their soda is really good
Where kofola?
Man, this is incredibly useful, despite the fact that I dislike carbonated drinks in general and this will never care about what soda tastes the best.
And by the way, Kroger sodas are all very good. I lived in Kentucky for a short while and Kroger had sodas that were better than ALL their big brand counterparts. And that's coming from a guy who swears by original Mountain Dew
I grew up in the midwest in Michigan. But Ive never said pop because it doesnt sound correct. I say soda
Wheres Pepsi max
I am a kid and love coke

Woop, Woop! A all dayyyy!
Whenever they were doing the diet Sam’s cola one I was drinking Sams Cool cool cool
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What about coke zero
I call them fizzle buzzles
Just went to one of the stores it seems to be the same as you described it
15:32 I don't call it anything as an umbrella term personally, I mostly call the drinks by their actual name. So Pepsi Max, Coke, Fanta etc..., however the universally accepted umbrella term is soft drink.
food loin diet cola in south carolina is so good
Boylan is good for root beer
No
Not that I'm sure it matters now but as someone who works for Kroger, if Matt wanted to make a video about theyre all the same, he could place an order on the website to have all the different sodas delivered to his house with our delivery service. They ship the stuff they don't have at any of the stores around that location overnight so you can have it next day.
Artificial sweeteners do not belong in biology. Poison. Fyi.
coke zero!!
book theory when???
i hate how they did a rock paper scissors since this is for matpat not Stephanie’s preference

Grew up saying Coke. Was both generic term for sodas and Answer to what kind of coke...
Diet Coke is nasty af. My bro bought one by accident from a machine and I drank like a fifth then threw it away.
MAT!!! I love drinking Zevia but the blue one is not super good, I like the red one best. It’s supposed to taste like Dr Pepper (which it does)
While I was watching this I was drinking a can of Pepsi
I call it by its name or sometimes pop
I’m kinda shocked that they didn’t figure in the variability of fountain drink mix ratios (syrup to soda water) and disqualify fountain as a result. Yes, Coca-Cola has recommended ratios for their fountain offerings, but ultimately, your local gas station is going to mix that stuff as watered down as possible to maximize profit.
C.
pop
13:06 I'm 100 percent sure that this is my local Harris teeter
Steph and mat deciding if it’s pop or soda: Me who’s always called them fizzy drinks:
This video explained something that has bothered me for the last 10 years. Publix. I now know what it is And why my British self has a sticker that says: publix loves kids (I lived in Florida for the first 3 years of my life)
man you know i never realized i knew my sodas well until i watched this video
18:02 harris teeter is 10 seed not 13 seed

Food lion? Do you  mean delhaize?
Gonna have to side with steph including florida in your southeast comment, florida may BE  in the southwest but it is probably the furthest thing from being south eastern in culture lmao
In Australia we call it a soft drink I was never allowed to drink caffeinated drinks growing up and as such don't like cola flavour but I do love lemon lime and bitters it's also are national drink  ❤️
no way
I think coke has less of a taste than other sodas. Or that coke's taste is tasteless.
In South Africa we just ask what cold drink you want 🤣
Definitely a “pop” guy. Also from Midwest
I remember Food Lion when I was a kid in Texas. back when they where doing better lol. definitely trying the Harris Teeter one if I'm ever in NC! EDIT: or I may just go to Kroger....
i love the rock paper scissors. you can see why they got married
Steph : Wow i dont even have a joke for that me: ooop then I know its serious

Soda-pop
Tried it at a Kroger near me and it did have that fruit reallly nice taste

Me watching a video about someone doing a diet soda tournament when I find diet soda disgusting. Diet coke being my least favorite. I can stomach a can of diet pepsi but coke is just vile. Which is weird since I like regular coke more than regular pepsi by a small margin.
15:35 Im a pop man myself (im 14) But whatever
You can’t!
I live in Phoenix, Arizona and here we just call it soda🥤... I've only ever heard it called soda, even on planes! I know other people call it different things so idk why! I only like orange Fanta and sometimes other orange sodas so I get really annoyed when they only serve Coke, Pepsi, Dr Pepper, Sprite, etc! I can never get soda when they do that! It has always made me relieved when 0.000001% of food places (other than fast food chains) actually DO! 🙄😮‍💨😌
I drank a Pepsi while drinking this and now i want a coke this says a lot about how much if some one has something you don’t have something (more soda) you want it more.
In Australia, I've heard them called soft drinks and fizzy drinks.
Glass bottle coke is the best coke.
soda pop
ngl STEPH is kind rocking my world
Citric acid is the best, been using it for year descaling machine and other things
Even though Idk Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter for the win!🥳
D: fizzy drink
TIL MatPat and I live in the same state, so I recognized almost every one of these stores and brands! Today (maybe) you learned: Food Lion, the grocery brand he said you've probably never heard of who beat out Diet Pepsi, was the brand of orange soda used in Kenan and Kel.
mat you cannot say "lets get pourin friends" that sounded like somthin else
Guys Gordon Ramsay is here
I mean diet cok

This is hilariously late, but if anyone was curious, Krogers diet cola and haris teeters diet cola have the same ingredients, in the same order and the same allergen ingredients. So I think it's safe to say it's fairly likely they are the same :)

I was today years old when I found out MatPat may have grown up in the Midwest! As a Minnesotan, I’m beyond happy!!!😎👍 MIDWEST LETS GOOOOOO!!!!! And as for what I or my family calls these drinks, in my experience, we mostly just use the term “soda”, but we also tend to use all the words to describe them, depending on whatever we wanna call them at that moment. (We even use the more “scientific” term: “soft drink” on occasion!) So we don’t seem to have a collective preference for the name of soda in general, but we (or at least I) like to say “soda” because it’s easy to understand and say and stuff.
Food4Less sells what is basically Harris Teeter Coke. And its our favorite coke.
I think mat Pat will make a book theory show
I am a Soda
Caloric value is a horrible system to judge by since it is by far not accurate. 0 calories does not mean 0 value to the body as fuel/weight gain. If you actually research how the caloric standard is quantified you would <facepalm>.
Coke is good. Pepsi is baaaaaddd
Here are some facts for people  Sugar is actually better for you than sucralose (the fake sugar).  Not to mention, sucralose has an annoying linger in its sweetness that isn't enjoyable.
I’m from Tennessee I’ve never called it “pop” or “soda” if I’m talking about ALL soft drinks in general I’ll say pop like for instance “I’m cutting out regular pop and only drinking diet” but any other time I’ll just call it by it’s name 😂 Pepsi, coke, mountain dew, Dr Pepper. Just by it’s name
3:46   Turn on subtitles.
I am läsk which is soda in Swedish 😂
From Melbourne in Australia and in the land down under we call it a soft drink.
I worked as a mechanic in the army and every other person drank monster and about a fifth dipped. I used to drink  monster java until my can was used mistakenly as a spittoon, a fact i registered when noticing the subtle mint flavored when I finished it. Anything that's truly fresh coffee based gives me 'gut rot', so in order to get my caffeine fix I started buying diet coke - the 20 oz bottle w/ a cap so i could just throw it in my pocket. The same guy who used my monster java as a dip spit bottle also loved to 'inform me' that diet coke was worse for you than regular coke with whatever speech impediment is caused by having a wad of dip under you lip.   As an aside, despite what every résumé i've ever made says, i don't pay attention to detail and am not a very discerning person, but after watching this video i can't stop tasting how much better fountain diet coke is than bottled.
9:01 that’s crazy! I am playing with my Back to the Future LEGO set as I watch this

Where I am from, I always heard people say coke in old Montgomery
I still like diet cocola and pepsi
Watching this got me thirsty for soda. Good thing I had a case right near me
15:30 over here in hungary it's all cola
Fizzy buble’
You can just buy both sodas
We say fizzy or fizzy drink where I'm from because it's a drink that's fizzy
I think that diet coke is really NEW COKE
You really should cut all soda from your diet. So bad for you.

pepsi max is the best

Didn’t you say you were in California on film tho ey when you were doing the Disney death count?
I’m Pepsi, not Coke, and not Coca-Cola.
As someone who knows Harris Teeter and Food Lion, this made me really happy. But when you briefly put up a clip of Fred Meyer I lost my mind, I was wayyy happier about that than I should’ve been lmao
am i the only one who realized he spat everywhere at 19:1

Why would you drink something that tastes so awful in the first place?

Matpat: I’m going to stop drinking coke and drink coke!
my fav diet soda is coca cola zero because we don't have diet coke in romania
For me in the uk it’s what ever the name is for mtn dew it’s just mtn dew
Coke
Soda
Matpat? Pffff it's fatpats time to shine
Option other  [I don’t know what option bonk is] (Edit don’t drink bonk it’s for me well unless you wanna get radioactive poisoning)
Coke Zero>>>>>>Diet Coke
Diet Pepsi sitting in the corner
Peppsi > Coke imo but ik some people dont agree
Soda
Water is hellhy
If ya need to poop and want soda and you’re in the uk, get a cola flavored Mini Pops Sugar Free.
“Don’t do as I do and do as I say friends” - MatPat 2021 Me: *Drinks 10 gallons a day of Diet Pepsi*
Just being honest, even tho it's just haste testing sodas it turned into one of my top 5 matpat vids, love your vid mat! Keep it up
I’m sprite
Way late to the party but I have loved Big K (Fred Meyer) diet soda forever. The only thing I don’t like about it compared with Diet Coke is that it goes flat faster (cans).
For us it's soft drink
pop
Walmart, food lion, Harris teeter and Big K soda are all made by vess bottling St Louis Missouri
The zero sugar sodas taste so much better than the diets. No point in drinking diet or regular sodas anymore
Never thought I'd see the day
diet soda is worse for you than the normal stuff
did u know the fountain diet cola 🤔  they might water and then with ice more water so there's more water than cola
other bubbly corn syrup

Haris teeter 13 seeder is wrong about 18:06
Not me rooting for Harris teeter just cause I like the store
Where I grew up in Australia everyone used the word “fizzie drink”
I call it "yummy yummy caffeine juice with good nice sugar flavor"
YOU WHAT?!
I call it fizzy drink. Maybe because I'm from Aus. But Pop is just something alien to me, like who uses pop?
Why am I sitting here rooting for the soda I don't even have access to 😂
every person who has been watching: W H A T ?
i call it sodie :)
Diet Mountain Dew
Food lion is called Delhaize, pronounced Del-ez, in Luxembourg where i live, or i think so, cus it has the same logo
Is this like when Mark tried to quit and replace takis?
*hopes Dr pepper would win*  Matpat: no Dr pepper  *Clicks off video*

as a food lion employee, lets go
Zevia is so good

No Faygo, is a no go. 🪓
We call it sody water. Lol no its just soda
I stopped drinking soda 2+ years ago
I am d cuz I drink root beer
Me I am a D:Other
I think that if coca cola (the industry) starts making ice cream drinks (shakes) it should be called Mocha Cola or Coca Mocha! The 2nd one is better, I hope they consider it! if I make a diet soda it will probably use small bits of honey, mixed with delicous fruit, instead of those chemicals in diet coke for example.
17:28 when in doubt, add citric acid
I live in VIRGINIA and the closest grocery store to my house is Food Lion. Explain yourself, MATTHEW.
Florida being distinct from the southeast, no, she's right.
sooooo many of my friends growing up drank diet coke cuz of their moms... I LOVE Diet Coke. straight from a cold can or over refrigerator ice please
i am a C
Im pop
is it just me or when i first watched this i want the harris teeter? idk spelling to win cuz i dont atually know i just think its going to win idky but i do and its not that i like the store no no no im asian or filipino we dont have that. so just asking did this also happen for you
What if you just took Diet Coke and then added in some citric acid, to sort of simulate the Harris Teeter diet cola's unique flavour?
Food lions is great
Pepsi max is bepis max
1:04 I love the fact that you. an shee him becoming more and more obsessed with diet coke
Food Lion is also here in virginia
Best channel
I live in Utah and call soda pop
WHY would you drink diet soda in any case? It’s disgusting!
Omg idk who needs a life more me or him 😂😂
I thought fountain would win but I guess not.

My husband is a huge Dr. Pepper connoisseur. He can taste the most minuscule differences in can vs bottle or based on location. I’m really curious to do this with DP
"its got that fruityness" so do i lmao
Well time to go to Fry's
I’m in Pittsburgh so it’s 100% pop for me. Makes me feel weird hearing it being called soda lol
Hey pick cola or Pepsi Hmmm I pick tea

Matt:In all honesty- Add:Lori Chavez’s dermimer wants to criminalize abortion in just six weeks
SODA ALL THE WAY
In Sweden (and maybe other countries) we call "Pepsi zero sugar" "Pepsi max"
In India, we call it thanda - means cold or cold drink usually.. never used Soda or pop...

i’m from VA and it’s weird hearing them say they never heard of food lion i thought it was a US round thing like every state had them
Soda
Well I used to work for Kroger. I can absolutely confirm that all brands under the Kroger label have identical product with different packaging for the market it is shipped to. Ie. Kroger and Fred Meyers and All other subidiaries have the same products just under a different label. If you  really enjoy Harris Teeter soda you gotta try Big K diet cola it is literally the same thing.......
I am from Georgia.........aka the state where Coke started........Safe to say all sodas are literally cokes. Or you name the exact soda you want. Ie a sprite, a Mountain Dew, etc. But I have also seen where any dark color soda is called a coke much like the example in the video of a Dr.Pepper still being called a coke. I have literally heard someone say they want a Dr.Coke before meaning they wanted a Dr.Pepper. The south is a crazy case all its own. I kinda go by the philosophy of I want the thing I name. For me its a Coke Zero. I also refuse to call it Coca Cola Zero Sugar. screw that noise give me a Coke Zero preferably in a bottle since its a little less fizzy than a can is to me..............just saying I want moderate fizz which to me is totally a thing. Although if I had a Fountain setup at my house Fountain coke zero is the best and I honestly do not know why but my theory is it being mixed "fresh" it has the right amount of carbonation for what I consider optimal.
boilins birch beer is on of my top 5 sodas
food lion is the same as belgiums delhaize
B and D, sometimes its soda sometimes is Soda Pop. Very similar, yet one is interpreted very different than the other. (from a SouthWest kid)
i love that even if he quits diet cola, thats still a theory.
It’s coke not soda or pop in the UK
I ask if I can have something that’s not milk or water it’s always no but that’s just at my house but I call it soda
Soda and I'm from the south.
sorry matpat i dont like diet soda... and im trying 2 just cut out soda COMPLETELY from ym diet and just do water with occasional lemonade/sunny d when wanting something more   wish i could send u a few bottles but the shipping b a killer good luck on ur quest
Food lion?? Its mega image here in romania but its the same thing!
in english i say soda but in my native language we say lemonade
B: SODA
soda
D: other- can
i call it fizzy drink, self explanatory
I drink a lot of diet sodas myself... However, it should be noted, they are terrible for you(as are drinks made with corn syrup).  Sodas in general are acidic and bad for your teeth.   Artificial sweeteners are where diet sodas get even worse, though. Those sweeteners have been shown to still cause insulin spikes. They're destructive to gut biomes. The increased sweetness also tends to increase binge eating/snacking. Diet sodas have also shown evidence to be disastrous for dental health (think meth teeth).  Thankfully, some sodas are starting to offer real sugar, again, but sodas as a whole, aren't great for you. Show restraint, and moderation.
I’m pop
That title ain’t a theory that’s a statement
I guess that one of the takeaways from this video is that the South knows about flavor.  That and that Matt and Steph are truly perfect for each other... ( 18:58 )
Dr Pepper is the king of soda
Soft drink     👇
B: Soda Forever!!!
game theory: how big would links magical bag in botw have to be?
Wait...Coke doesn't sell glass bottles in the US? It even tastes better than out of cans.
After going fully into longevity and massively cleaning up my diet, adding core nutrient supplements and adding fasting to my regular routine, the last ‘vices’ I had were alcohol and soda.  I feel 1000x better for cutting both out, and while I still have the odd glass of wine on special occasions, I wouldn’t touch soda ever again.  It tastes disgusting once you give your taste buds a break and go back to it.
It just came out this year aka 2022 the diet dream world coke
I’m pop
Bro my country say's Cold drink im not joking ☠
Please make a video about finding Olil’s favorite dessert 🧁

Kind of ironic that the first rule is cola flavour only and the won that won won because it had a non cola twist
17:27 isn't that in *BASIC CHEMISTRY!!!!*
17:25 mabye u should do an episode all about citric acid
No one:  Matpat:This one- Steph: No. This one.

Taste wise. i prefer coke zero over diet coke and now i want to try the harris teeter one
I’m probably other

Diet soda has cancer in it. Stick to regular

I will remember his dogshit hollow knight video
The long battle of Rock Paper Scissors on which neither of them changed just shows again that they’re perfect for each other 😂😂😂
Yeah the sodastream flavours are called syrup, you can even just use normal water and a bit of the syrup
POV: MatPat just wanted to grab a cheap diet cola and just did this video to convince Steph to do so
British say the name of the drink
In Britain we just call it by the brand.... at least my family does
So coca cola zero is the actual winner without bias.  I think it's cool he has a cheaper favorite alternative.   Harris Teeter the Rocky of diet cola. Randomly picked and shocked the world.
I LOVE STEVIA !
As Ohio''s neighbor Indiana i call it ""POP""
Maybe you could try fanta?
On Finland we Call soda limu.

I call it soda, pop, and soda pop
I've been to a food lion i live in TN also we call it a drink also sorry for so many comments although you probably won't see them
My parents use stevia and they used to use Splenda
Nooooooo not the diet coke obsession!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
e
I say pop and soda
In nashville here, and Kroger = better Diet Cola.. but the cans > bottle! diet coke itself loses the flavor so quickly when opened!
I got a diabetes medicine ad during this.
kroger isnt in canada.:'(
15:32 soda
2:39 For Freee????
Test Sunkist and Fanta type sodas
A year late to the soda party, but Kroger's store brand stuff is... okay. It's not as good as Coca-Cola, or even Sam's in my opinion, but it's probably *because* of the citrus-y flavor it has. (Possible confirmation of Mat's suspicion?) My personal favorite will likely always be Pepsi, despite people insisting they taste the same. I specifically like fountain Pepsi, bottle being my second favorite.
15:32 I’m c

isn't Splenda just chlorinated sugar?
Diet drinks gives cancer and I like Pepe’s
Northern Midland accent Midwesterner here, team soda
Reading draft he's missing Reading draft its the best Diet Cola
I prefer non diet 365 cola, from Whole Foods. It tastes better then Coca-Cola in my opinion and is a lot cheaper. I hate all diet colas though including the 365 one. Zevia is pure cancer though.
I am laughing right now, I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and seeing Zevia in this video made me smile from knowing that it is acknowledged. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i think  matpat would like l&p from new Zealand like if you agree
Honestly zevia is actually very good, mat has purely just gotten the wrong flavor, plus zevia is good for your health, mat, next time try a better flavor :)
I can confirm your Publix is in Florida
zevia for me

Oh you won't cook yeah what kind oh yeah I want a Pepsi:LA vibes

I recommend faygo if you can get your hands on it
Ok, so everyone on my street, my family and me, just called soda "fizz"... Did anyone elses families or friends do that?
I was first introduced to Boylans throygh my local bingo burger, their rootbeer is my favorite
Diet Coke is better
Bepis 👍
I’m the antimatpat I’m known for drinking original Coca-Cola
fun fact: after i watched this video i asked my mom if we could get the diet soda from our local kroger, and my gosh did it taste just how you and steph described. Regular cola flavor, not too sweet, and has a very nice fruity after taste. Even though i'm not a big soad drinker, i'd get it again. 10/10
I'm pop and soda, I live in Ohio.
You should try Fanta, not because of nazis
Trust me. Zevia tastes like a$$.
I LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA.
Stephanie blink twice if you are being held hostage
This shocked me because I'm like MatPat on this one I LOVE Diet Coke but when he decided it was his number 2 I now sometime need to try out this new coke flavor store brand
15:32 in britiann we call it, "a bao o' souda pop"
Please do a video on artificial sweeteners.  It would be fascinating!

14:03 i think my best friend spoke his latin wrong again and possesed matt
bro you need to try jones soda it's lit
I do not drink a lot of  soda however I would rank Soda Stream higher in the ranking since I have made diet soda with the soda stream and it tastes really  good.  So my top rating would be Fountain Diet Coke, Pepsi Zero Sugar, Soda Stream,Bottled Coke, Coke Zero
Others
I’m more of a sprite guy
Just curious, why not drink the regular sodas instead of diet? Isn't diet Coke worse than than regular Coke. I personally prefer water with lemon. But, to each their own.
There is one that probably is only in Australia and New zealand but it's called karma cola and was made by the company that made lemmy the lemon lemonade.
I get a smiths just down the road from my house. And if walk there everyday. They have fresh ingredients everyday and yeah the sodas are cheap, but they carry weight. Lol. Cheap, delicious and convenient. The trifecta
About ttime
Im a B fohere shure
As a human I call ‘soda’/‘pop’ carbonated drink.
There's a great one, it's called water. It's great; been around for thousands of years.
I have a vendetta against Shasta. This is what my extended family always offered and never specified it was different. Just poured and handed. Baby me just wanted a soda and they handed me that abomination. I've not forgiven Shasta Cola as a whole since.
If you’re not drinking Diet Coke how about you drink Coke zero
B
But that's just a food theory, right?
I’ve always found grocery store brand soda to be a great deal. They always have a spin-off flavor that’s really compelling
I am more of a almond water myself
15:11 as an Irish, I call them "fizzy drinks" 🇮🇪
I'm drinking "Freeway Cola" when watching this
I keep rewatching this vid
you telling me no one had fizzy drink😯
Soda Pop
In our country diet coke doesnt exist only coca cola zero
B
It’s called ‘soft drink’ here in (QLD) Australia; it is in a few countries, I think (I say QLD, because WA has some weird slang lol).
Yes
In pakistan we just call it a “cold drink”
I've actually never liked coke or Pepsi. I've always been a root beer and dr.pepper guy.
I normally don't drink diet soda but diet Coke has always been my favorite,now I have to get my hands on some Harris Teeter it sounds amazing I'm going to head over to City Market later this week and look for something that maybe the same product but like you said with a different label.
I usually call it  soda or soda pop!
this is all Lies, He still drinks Diet Coke.
15:33 im a pop guy
in the intro i just realized theres the peanut butter jelly time banana meme in the background-
Okay so this might get me in trouble with the coke police. But my husband actually works for Coke. And I don't know about the cans and the bottles but the syrup is slightly different for the fountains. And actually McDonald's has its own drink syrup that they buy from Coke that is even more slightly different. But for legal purposes in case they read and husband doesn't get in trouble that's all just the theory
BBM
Tbh MatPat's diet coke obsession is just like my Fish flavored chips and Mexican Cola obsession

Diet Coke is so bad for you that when your older, your bones could become soft and delicate and/or have heat diese
Hi big fan
I quit soda.
I have a food lion here in Glasgow KY
Team "other". We call it cooldrink where I'm from.
I’m more of a B.soda person
The Diet Coke taste is something I have, but for… water. And not flavored water. Bottled water tastes different than tap. Warm tastes different then cold, etc.
Is it just me or coke zero taste like regular coke
just drink regular coke
Pop definitely
the fact that this came out on my birthday is really cool!! this is my sign to drink more diet coke! ả̵̰͖̈́͑͒͆͛̃̒̆͘ņ̴̺̹͙́̈́̏̍̐̑͐̓̉d̶̯͉̥́̆͛̎̋̈́ ̷̧̮̤̪̬̹̰̰̯͂̓̃̚i̴̫̦̦̞͆̊̌̊͐́̓͠ ̵̼̣̇̑͐̃͝ẃ̶͓̱̣̰̝̩͉͈̥í̵̘͇̲̥̹̭̽͜͝ľ̵͕̭l̴̨͉̹͙̫͛

u live in nc?
Shasta's not too bad, but not as good as other pops
Soda
I'm so surprised by Boylan. Every Boylan soda I've had has been great. never had their diet cola before though.
Hey MatPat. i challenge you to experiment EVERY soda from south america. and decide if one of them are better than the winner of this episode. (new series?)
soda lol
Soda
Soda
we are coke  for people who sit at home and send someone to buy cooldrink, we call it coke

Krabby patty has citric acid if its so good (sorry im not english so i will Make spelling mistakes)
Food lion is international. We call it Delhaize, but it's the same store
fanta

I would just think all of them taste the same lol
i dont know im a mt dew guy
I'm going to HT tomorrow
11:15 Matt: That's good! Thats very pleasant! Stephanie: Mine was not a winner..  ...  Matt: Actually I take back what I said, it's horrible
actually we dont call it anything we just say coke sprite pepsi etc
Kroger is my favorite!! The Citrus Drop Zero is the BEST! It has a crisp, not too sweet citrus flavor and is supposed to be a generic for Mountain Dew, but it’s better!! The diet ginger ale is so good, too. It actually has the bite of ginger at the end.
i'lll sick wih my coke zero
Soda stream flavors are already pretty awful and those are the non diet ones so I am not surprised at their reactions. Also 1 year anniversary gang. Ok nevermind. Lol I said that before they revealed the drink. But sodastream is awful as well.
its funny that you say north carolina represent because pepsi is also from north carolina.  also i say pop im an ohio boy
I love Shasta ngl one of my favorites
zevia
Pepsi Max is my mums Diet Coke to Matpat
Try PopCola with Stevia

I'm so sad that you quit diet coke
I love it when Stephanie calls mat-pat MATTHEW
Little did they know that all old school sodas are awful and not worth even trying.
Your allegiance has been diluted Matt Pat you have gone AWOL
find someone who can rock-paper-scissors draw you for infinity like this
only commenting to say I do know what food lion is
Coke is the supperour name to call “soda”
MATPAT be capping. He’s just had so much Diet Coke he’s blind to the flavor.
Fruity… I don’t know why but I also get that flavor vibe when you mix Diet Coke and normal coke.
So... No-one else calls it soda-pop? Or, when you're feeling extra funky, 'sodi', but only with closer folks "Ehh, gimme a can o' that sodi, mate, could ya? Oip- fanks!"  To be clear- I am not Canadian. Or Australian. Converted Michigander here. (Meaning I was born and used to live elsewhere) Anyways, soda-pop.
A and b
I say soda and pop but not soda pop
You didn't test Diet Coke from a glass bottle? In my experience, sodas from a glass bottle taste better than the same soda from any other container.
Im a Coke guy
stephanie: eww  also stephanie: wOw
1:00 And borderline stalks Diet Coke 🥤🤣
Oh man that sucks
GOOOOOGLE IS A THING...
Crystal Pepsi’s back
You should try "guarana" It is a Brazilian soda made of the plant with the same name that grows in Brazil
D: soft drink/coke
Its true i have the fruti taste
Wtf why is march maddness in September not march???
Mattpatt: "It's a store based in NC you've probably never heard of it." Me: *Lives in Virginia and adores Food Lion* Wait it's not everywhere?-
I hear it as pop all the time.But on rare occasions i hear soda....mostly from my mom.
Shasta tastes like regret and despair that you paid for that
i say soda my dad my dad says pop
I immediately checked to see if this was on April 1st
Doctor Pepper fans deserved more
Here in Spain we have Green Cola which is cheaper than diet coke and uses Stevia as a sweetener.
17:30
I called Sodas both Soda or Coke. (im grew up in the carolinas area) so There is Coke, and there is Cola. DrP, as said, is also a Coke, but Not a Cola. and everything that is carbanated is a soda. (everything, even if you just sodastream some water. watersoda)
Your not MatPat
Ok so this tournament started with “just cola products, no added extra flavors” and ended with a winner because of its added citrusy flavor. Are we going to get a stand off between Harris Teeter and Cherry Coke Zero?
16:07 Take it up with the committee that seeded the bracket!
As one of many with a sucralose allergy, I can guarantee it isn't safer in the least. I'm just one of the few that are more susceptible to its toxic effects. True diet sodas are far safer. Also, local Big K (Krogers brand) cola does in fact have that same citrus flavor, diet or not.
I live in Charlotte isn’t that cool
Diet faygo
For me personally in the UK. It's a D. You say what you want by it's name i.e. coke (coca cola), sprite, pepsi. The collective noun that I have always used in 'fizzy drinks' although my dad in his childhood called it 'pop' so I don't know?
a
soda
Glass bottled coke tastes the best
I choose b soda
How did you get fountain soda as the best? It's almost always the worst for me. Usually I find that: can = 20 oz or smaller bottle > 2-liter bottle > fountain.  *Then again,* you've missed something in your testing. Cans and small bottles are assumed to be drunk from the container, while 2-liter and fountain are prepared to be poured into a cup, not to mention that half the time when you do fountains no two fountains use the exact same amount of syrup. Ergo since you poured them into a cup to test the various diet cokes, you did the can a disservice.
Am I the only one noticing that for some reason Vanilla Coke and its variants weren’t in this video?
So, is Fountain Diet Coke really "readily available"? You can have dozens of bottles or cans bought and stored near you, ready for consumption, but you'd need a machine for fountain.
In Australia we call it soft drink 😊
we are fizzy juice
my family just says fizzy drink or " a fizzy"
I really want to see a theory on the episode "the menu" on THE AMAZING WORLD OF GUMBALL specifically the part where Richard eats so much he pops all of his tires when he sits in his car but u probably won't see this but I would still love to see that video   PS everyone that likes the amazing world of gumball please like this comment so matpat will see it

B: soda

B-bb-but… u always loved Diet Coke… Just why do you quit Diet Coke..? U speak coke coke coke every episode…….. :o :( 💔coke:((
Carbonated fizzy sugary water is what I call it
Even though I grew up in Ohio I still spent a majority of my life in Florida, so I say soda snd sometimes pop
T_T Never heard of food lion? T_T i known them my whole life xD
Wow Maddie Patty Take it easy with that kind of entitlement my friend.  Remember they They don't make diet sodas just for you.
0:23 PORTAL REFRENCE
pop
No way he quit coke I can't imagine snorting all of that
you should know that the flavours stay more in a glass bottle compared to plastic or metal
Where I’m from it’s called soft drink, fizzy drink, canned drink.
MatPat: "After 6 Full Games, We tied."  Me: "Wow. Its almost like you're married or something..."
When Matpat said my alliegence is to the I really thought he’d say “to the republic to DEMOCRACY”
You now 365 hole foods is made by food lion
I love how Steph was cradling the Johnnie Ryan In her arms and apologizing to it after she didn’t like it 😂 I love when Steph is on the channel!
I always grew up with it as “pop”, but for some reason it recently just became “soda” again
im a manaos guy
I said Soft drink
IDC what anyone says, Coke Zero is goated
I’m b
Soft drink. We have soft drinks
other i say fizzy
I am from Iowa so I say pop
Hey, Marylander here, I was really surprised when Matt said that "You've probably never heard of Food Lion" which is crazy cuz they are everywhere
I been in a Publix in Florida.
Diet Coke earnings after this video 📉
Imagine being the cashier for a store near matpat, constantly watching him buy a ton of 1 item and leave
Diet is more fattening like those old day energy drinks sponsored for working out..
soda all the way
Now if only Moxie Soda could start selling to the rest of the country... Would be cheaper then blowing 20-40 bucks to get it the more... Less pleasant way, of acquiring it third-party wise.
Stephs face when matpat choose Harris Teeter over diet coke broke me🤣
here in Europe we say just simply: Cola...
4:39 let the diet what now?
This was so scientific. Maybe you could try it with water. Dasani vs Aquafina!
He just wanted to have diet coke as a business expense
Oh ya that stuff is no good for you man. Better off drinking water and Body Armour style drinks. I stopped drinking soda about a year ago, I think I've had 2 since then. But ya, definitely best off just not drinking soda's period. I never even contemplated drinking Diet Sodas because they're not that great and better to have other non carbonated drinks.
No...no...no...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Soda pop
Canada Dry
I call it soft drink
I’m in the southern part of the USA but me and my family say soda
We call it a bangshwishkawabbit here in the britain
i wish he would try diet sprite
My moms from Mac and she agrees with you she loves Harris titter
I'd probably be more interesting if they didn't know which one was which after every round
stevia gets better once you're used to it.
I've kinda called it both "soda" and "pop". Most New Yorkers would say soda, but here in Western NY you actually see a lot more people saying pop. I remember when I was younger "pop" is what I called it almost always, but now I usually say "soda".
The Thumbnail is just Matt pouring the diet coke into a glass as he would never waist the drink
How about zx cola? It’s nice
SOME ONE CALL THE FOUR RIDERS OF THE APOCALYPSE MAT PAT HAS BEEN SICKENED
“But let’s be real coke no one’s gonna call it that”  I call it that
This episode is almost like the 2022 march madness😄
the failure in your plan is the basis: pour a glass or open the can. Let it rest 5hours, 8hours, 14hours... does it still have fizz? Yep? That's the winner. Pepsi Zero and Diet Coke, Coke Zero are winners
Only ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke
hello
Lemon juice is also what makes any ranch good in my opinion
im a cold drink kinda person
I call it pop and soda and I live in southern state of Arkansas. I don't like when people say "Coke" cause to be honest, I think Root Beer, Dr. Pepper, and Sprite are tops. I never really liked Coke, I mean don't get me wrong it's fine but I think the ones I mentioned are right up there.
This is all wrong. You should NOT know what brands you are testing. All you should know is the seed number.
Here in Israel we call them Fizzling drinks. That's it. Soda here means sparkling water.
Can you do a video researching if sugar substitutes are safe to consume. Because a lot of them aren't.
Idk if this is just a Canada thing but me and people i know  both call it pop or soda
Im definitely late but i like zevia but not the regualr cola i mostly just like the root beer
In the caribbean its soft drink or sweet drink but Im a dual citizen so I still call it soda
other its fizzy or fizzy drink in New Zealand
METRO MARKET IS OWNED BY KROGER?!? No WONDER I felt like a was back in Arkansas every time I stepped in there.
Pov: you call it soft drink-
*starts crying in British *
240 hi
So after watching this video I went to Kroger's to check their diet soda. It does in fact have citric acid. And I am noticing a bit of that fruity after taste you mentioned. So it's probably the same stuff. It's pretty good
in the UK, some people call soda fizzy drinks
Matpat: Now, SodaStream isn't soda per se, it's a machine that allows you to make your own soda.  Also MatPat: Fountain soda is totally on par with bottle/can soda.
option e
You didn’t try the glass Coke
Pop I live in Alberta, so in the mid west
I call it pop
Why is it that near the middle of the video I started smelling soda!
Y'know, I'm something of a Pepsi Zero enjoyer myself
Why do I love Food Theory more than every other theory channel?
Soda
mat: food lion you probal never heard of it me:I live in NC
There's one from my country (New Zealand) called phoenix and it's a bit pricy but it's organic and has heaps of flavour.
Im in firm belief that if you call a pepsi a coke you dont need either of them
I just don't understand how you can like diet coke, the aftertaste is just awful
I don't know about other aussies but I grew up callin soda soft drinks
Diet pepsi
soda
In Australia is Soft Drink
i love how matpat is always so energenic about A SODA
I'm just going to tell you if this needs to be said anything that's called boylan's yeah I'm going to say not the best thing to put in your body
D: other I call it fizzy drinks
See this is a theory because Matpat will not be quitting Diet Coke
Lol borderlands
To late mat
POV: you say soft drinks
Did you go to Harris teeter in flowers???
that rock paper scissors is a good example of why they're married
somthing funny is the two brands matt says"You've probily never heard of" Ive heard of both of them
pop
dude i dont get how people drink coca cola. i think its disgusting
im docta pebba
Can confirm that Kroger brand sodas are all fairly fire. Source worked for Kroger right after Harris teeter was purchased, and tasted them. I don't even like the company any more, because of how they treated me, but Kroger sodas still rock.
Soda pop
I always call it fizzy or pop
Diet soda is worse for you than regular soda. Fake sugars cause cancer.
I grew up with soda here out west
I say soda but most of my classmates say pop
Here in Florida, if you don’t call it Soda then you get thrown to the dogs
If you slow it down 2 of the scenes shown in 1:03 are literally MatPat go bouncers for Diet Coke
So proud of Harris Teeter for winning for my home state. Small chain wins against the big guys. It's a beautiful story lol
Soda
15:29 I'm not from English speaking country so neither
as a native floridian i can confirm we love publix.  So bad in fact that they outnumber other grocery stores down here and pretty much dominate the industry.  If you havent tried there Fried Chicken yet do it, its fireeee.
Australia: soft drink or fizzy drink.
Coke zero fountain would have crushed this
The incorrect, inexplicable seeding matchups is driving me crazy.  I'm the nutjob here, but still..
Harris teeter was my local grocery store growing up in Washington, DC. And I assumed it was based around there because I never saw it anywhere else, I’m shocked to find out it’s from NC
my stomach got swollen from pepsi 💀
im D.  in the UK ive heard them be called either Fizzy drinks or Soft Drinks. I think i say "Fizzy drink's" more then "soft drinks" though.
soda
Everything is coke
Food lion is also hannaford and stop n shop for those who live up north. They're all owner by delhaze
I've solved the crabypaty secret formula it's it's ummm it's citric acid
Whare I live it's called Coke but I call it soda cause it's easy
The women was to stunned to speak...
Where Pepsi Max
I LOVE THIS VODEO
B, lived in the west  Definitely soda
Why not drink others like diet rootbeer, it's not too bad, just rootbeer without some of the other stuff.
Soft drink
I was confused when he “said for those who don’t know what food lion is” because I’ve lived in Virginia most my life, and we have one just a few minutes away.
soda
You should do best monster energy drink!
You literally missed Diet Pepsi
As an Ohioan who shops at Kroeger for most of all the groceries and items he needs, this feels good that a Kroeger owned brand is the winner of the competition.
Steph the entire time looks so confused the entire intro
I call them by their name so I think it's C(?)
A: pop
I feel so weird hearing that some of them are too sweet etc. For me, no artifically sweetened drink was actually sweet, I just feel a chemical taste, a bit of sweetness and then emptiness where the real "sweet part" should be.
20:50  Steph:😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
You: you probably don't know food Lion. Me: EVERYONE IN NORTH CAROLINA KNOWS WHAT FOOD LION IS
Feel free to imagine this is a heavy southern accent.    “Now Down ere’ in Florida! Everyone I talked to calls it soda I don’t know any one from emerica’ that calls it *pOp* unless you some kind of e-euro.. ehhh European yeah! Some kind of European.”
The secret ingredient to the Krabby Patty: Citric Acid
And what about good old wa´ah?
I worked as a service leader at a chain grocery partnered with Delhaize Lion. It blew my mind when I found out they have the same stores all over the country,  just under different names.
ima see if i can do this with doctor pepper              i love doctor pepper but there is a korean {i think} drink called cheerwine you gotta try it sometime its my number 1
Karma cola
They should have done rock paper scissor lizard  spock
soda definitely
Matpat it might shock ya, but food lion is an international brand. Where I'm from it's called delhaize, or at least it's written like that. And there home brand is called 365.
I still think that it was cheating to have Diet Coke get to be a fountain drink. It's fresh mixed and everything, of course it's better!
POP FOREVER
at 15:32 I say D other: liquid heart attack
give me my bopa
Always B
bruh all coke iv heard it before but thats a BRAND so obviously soda
I'm from the UK, and I'm a pop gal
Ma Favourite Coca-Cola is Coca-Cola light😀
As a scot we just call the drunks fizzy juice or it’s name coke pepsi irn bru etc
18:56 Stef is actually Shroud. Those Reflexes are insane she shiftet from rock to paper. in 0.3 Sec.
Coca Cola light, aka Diet Coke, quit out of Finland some years ago. Strictly speaking, in 2019, but the decline of Light Coke started already in 2006. Light Coke was not a success in Finland because it tried to be a feminine equivalent of Coca Cola Zero for women. The difference between Coca Cola's Finnish version of Zero and Light was that Light was sweetened with sucralose and aspartame, while Zero is sweetened with acesulfame K and aspartame.
Called it pop as a child in the Midwest moved the the south at preteen age now it is soda after a lot of poking fun from others
There is a soft drink brand in Canada called “Jones” made out of cane sugar.   There isn’t a Diet Coke flavour, but they’re very good. It might not be available in America, though.
Hold up wait a minute
Matpat: we use a very scientific method to determine the best soda.  Also matpat: let’s rock paper scissor?
Put milk in a soda stream trust me it will be funny
The problem with fountain, is it can differ from location to location
“I am really curious to know if kroger is secretly supplying us all with the most delicious diet cola the world has ever tasted” proceeds to show us a picture of the United States 23:25

pepsi is better
Soda
At our school we do animal or mammal madness. And I kept telling them that it was not fair that a shrimp was going against for whale. And all my friends are laughing at me Oh it's not real you shouldn't be complaining about fake animals dying.  I really hate animal injustice and animal cruelty. Weather it's real or fake.
"One of the soda specialty shops near our house"  . . . ??
Putting sugar in milk tastes better ________________________________              Change my mind
D: it's called 'soda pop'  so both A and B are valid as shortened names for the same thing.  the name comes from how it was originally created, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and vinegar with water which would be sealed in a glass container and shacked. soda coming from one of the ingredients used and pop from the sound of the cork when it was opened.
I know pop not any other
Here in SE WI we call it soda
Shasta makes some fantastic raspberry and orange creme sodas
Canned Sams Cola is very bed imo
here in scandinavia (norway) its brus so d
I like snow too
Pop
Took your advice and tried Big K Diet Cola from Mariano's (our local Kroger owned supermarkets), the Kroger house brand.  I agree, this is better than Diet Coke.  It is also considerably less expensive, even when Coke is on sale.  Unfortunately inflation has hit Big K as well.  The price has gone up, but on sale it is 3 -12 packs for $10.  The problem I run into is the stores have a hard time keeping at least 3 boxes on the shelf.
I work in healthcare. Shasta is the patient drink.... If you forget yours you can be a patient for a minute
you missed diet pepsi lol
What about ginger ale?
I was immediately angry and disappointed with Mat pat when he thought that the poylan tasted like cough syrup 🤬
i call it cold drink
soda
"I QUIT Diet Coke!" Wait, that's illegal.
Wait till the Coca Cola company release a diet coke Matpat version
Bro is Dr pepper not a soda ??
I'd just buy Coke Zero, add Sweet & Low, and call it TAB.
This is still very biased. Because they know which is going against which. And they tell them the winner so they know which one is moving on into the bracket. Should've kept the brands secret from them (but not for the viewers) until the winner is decided.
fizzy drink
Olipop is by far the GOAT soda. I never liked soda, I don’t drink soda all because of how unhealthy it is. Olipop changed that. Try Olipop, they have a cola flavor.
I live in the UK 🇬🇧 so I call it fizzy drink so I go I want a fizzy drink which one? Come
15:33 where I live we call it either soda or other
I'm from Indiana and we call it soda but now i live in Florida aka Jurassic Park but I'm still team soda
My mum tells me the same lol do as i say not as i do 1:31
B
Crucial mistake with the choices from the big guys, Pepsi-Cola actually has its own recipe. It'd be interesting to see the differences between the two.
I literally tried Diet Coke just to find out why MatPat likes it so much. And, dare I say, I’m impressed
as an english person i call it fizzy… might just be my circle of people being too bri’ish innit
Cool thing, I work at another very small Kroger owned store(JayC food stores), but are much smaller than the other chains. They actually send us drinks with the Kroger store labels since we aren't big enough to have our own store brand products. So I have a feeling that the Harris teeter brand products are probably the same products sold by other Kroger owned stores
I'm interchangeable with pop and soda. I'm from the Midwest!
This is by far one of the most important videos on this channel
watching this while drinking canned diet coke           today I learned there's a difference between diet coke
This makes me want to do a March madness style bracket to find a diet cola I like myself in my area. Or even just a regular cola. Maybe I’ll get my friends on it. One of them even has a soda stream. Hmmmm 🤔
Soda
Half of my school likes march madness, the other half is hooked to this YouTube channel that created march mammal madness. (Which is the same thing, but may the best animal win) It is honestly the best thing to watch if your like me and don't really like sports.
Soda Pop up here in Canada!
Team: Soda   Grew up in Cali. and moved to Kansas. First time I heard it called "pop", I was so confused. There should just be one universal name for It.
Hi
Yeeeeessss and noooooooooo the memes will be stoped
Matpat is gonna get cancer if he drinks  anymore of that pepsi zero sugar.
Yeah, Coca-cola wouldn't approve of your skin color. That's why I switched to Pepsi.
Dude he could just drink Tab
towneclub cola
That last minute fill-in feels like the universe said "You're looking for a new diet soda, Mat? I got you, try this one!"
15:30 other bc im not english - icall it limukka or just say brand
I'm soda, but everyone wants me to say pop because of where I live
How can I buy that soda
Rock paper I live you guys
D. Other. Soda has fiz, like Coke.  Pop is sweet and flater, like Pepsi. Minnesota B!@$s

Mat go to England To try Pepsi Max maximum taste no sugar
diet pepsi is better
I really like how much effort and detail is put into the intro. Whoever made that did a great job!
Morocco has an interesting way of saying soda hers it is in a sentence waiters often say when they ask what drink we want very word will be translated    Shmn 'monada' bghiti?       =.        =.           = What.     soda.      do you want
We in Iowa and Southern Minnesota don’t have Any of those Kroger stores.
We call it pop.
I wonder if MatPat likes browned butter baked goods and caramel flavors? Coke taste more savoury/caramel to me and Pepsi more citric acid with a bitter after taste; more similar to the Starlight Coke that Mat reacted too(you should watch if you have not). I would imagine that the winning soda(team soda forever) has a more savoury flavor then the other competitors.
(sees the title)  BUT THATS JUST A THEORY
9:56 the only good zevia flavor is creamy root beer
pop
isn't it the same thing

15:32 Here in Romania we call it "Cola", but I call it both coke and cola tbh
One word for why you should continue to stay away from diest cola MatPat. Aspartame. Well, also probably want to stay away from sucralose. But aspartame is horrible for you and you are probably better off drinking regular Coca Cola if you had to drink soda at all. If you disagree, I would LOVE LOVE LOVE a Food Theory video about aspartame and your thoughts! Greatly value your commitment to science and logic and love all your vids! Love you guys! Keep up the great work! And congrats on one year staying away from something you love! Not easy so seriously congrats!
i am definitely a coke guy
Pop
I'm B, but I usually just call it by the brand name.
Something funny is how I didn’t know that Meijer is only in a few states,I didn’t know that until I moved to Florida and my parents told me their was no Meijer and since most people in Florida don’t know what that it,like how the north and Midwest doesn’t know what Publix is and could care less since they don’t have it,I only found out about it from watching a YouTuber that lives and grew up in Arizona
Did he try irn bru cause there is sugar free  and also extra (extra is a better tasting sugar free

You know Diet Coke is worse for you it is more like you'll get diabetes from drinking too much Diet Coke  does sugar uses your body can't handle that's why you gain weight faster when you drink it so much .
Coke is coke, Pepsi is coke, Fanta is coke, Dr Pepper is coke, sprite is coke. Root beer is coke.
Matpat loves diet coke more then his own wife sometimes
The universe has spoken
Boyland Birch Beer is the best
Soda and most restaurants don’t call it coke here in Tennessee at least
Glass bottle coke is the best coke variation in my opinion
In Sweden, we have long cans of coke zero.
Ngl I was wondering where Kroger soda was and at the end when you said Harris teeter merged with Kroger I'm 99 percent that I've had that type off soda
Regular sams cola is a beautiful replacement for coke, me and my mom were addicted to coke and we found sams at Walmart for the same taste but it’s cheaper
Be careful becaause.. coke knows your location...

I mostly drink cans but often my favorite are fountain ones, no ice ;They just taste better with a straw in my superior opinion 😂Also my entire family and myself all say Pop! And Mat's right, we are Midwestern and sometimes we say soda but almost always Pop, though I once said Soda-Pop cause my friend always says that and my sister looked at me like I was an Alien 😂

as a NC native and also a food lion employee, I love to find out they live in my state, but also, I have never heard of us calling all soda coke. normally we always have to ask coke or pepsi products.
I don't drink soda but as a local North Carolinian I'm very happy how good HT did haha.  Also I'm very late to this video wtf
I call it exactly from the name so like Coca-Cola vanilla
I’m soda

Indian pop called thumbs up is the best choice for all Indians
Having watched this video a second time, I realized you guys said people in the south call all sodas “coke” been living in South Carolina, and I have heard literally zero people use coke as a general term for soda 😂
Should really include all the diets not just the cola drinks just to see what comes up on top for matpat.
he dare betray diet coke!?

24:00 MATPAT IS CHEATING ON DIET COKE EXPOSED 100% REAL NOT CLICKBAIT
I think soda is the only answer for a broad overall word for soft drink, coke is a specific soft drink/soda and "pop" is just so fucking annoying
I use pop and soda interchangeably. However if it’s a certain type of diet drink which I’m pretty sure is Diet Coke, it’s always pop bc my mom used to always get it and we always called it pop.
off topic but i have that same glass table
ima a c
Please don't give up diet Coke it's amazing and it's addicting
Soda
Was it Ash filming this episode, it sounded like them
WTF but everyone hates Coca Cola's diet variant, also called light! That's the reason they made Zero! And fountains are literally the worst, objectively! Because it's mixed with water, so if you like the fountain version the most, you literally hates it! 😱
I'm also southern, north Louisiana to be exact, and I call it either coke or soda
Quick question. Is Pepsi zero calories
Borderlands refrencet
15:28 I am pop or pepsi lol
As someone from the Midwest, I've always called it soda! Though I've always been very specific with what I call different soft drinks, and I never really had any "chances" to call it soda / pop.
boylan root beer is wicked good but their diet cola is horrid
technichally this was a drink theory to wash down the food theories
There is another option, in Toronto, Canada there is a company called Cott which one of the biggest private label soda companies and recently was sold to Refresco from Netherlands but for a time Cott made RC cola, President's Choice and pretty much every private label pop out there... It could be that Refresco made that soda you liked
If we did what you do we’d be insane
Had to laugh when I saw the title
i'm soft, but we use that in dutch xd
so... do it again with different soda?
15:29 In the Philippines, we just call them softdrinks and if we want to buy from the sari-sari store, we either say let's buy softdrinks or let's buy (brand name). Incidentally, we used to have a softdinks brand called Pop Cola.
Make a short of doing this episodes winner vs the one that you couldn't find and swapped for the winner
Here in Washington state Kroger IS our value brand. Fred Meyer is our nearest and dearest.

My family and I have always been 'pop'
10:51 SHASTAAAAAAAAAAAA,  YESSSSSSSSS
ya see, i’m from the midwest and most people i know from around here call it soda
I live in Tennessee and we just call it soda. A few call it pop and the only people who call all soda coke is old people at dinners or gas stations. But it's called soda down here.
i like coca cola zero
Even my cat Smokey agrees with you
Also I agree with you with no diet dr. Pepper because it tastes gross absolutely despicable
If you love Diet Coke then you'll love it forever
Matpat you need a motional support buddy
Pop.
I feel like the least diet cola could do for you is send you free diet cola for all the free sponsorship.😭💗😂💯

20:44 look at stephanies face it looks like she just found out matpat is cheating on her with her 2 twin sisters

Harris teeter is cashing in his cola in the bracket/ money in the bank contact
FOOD LION! I haven’t seen a food lion in YEARS! Growing up we had a Piggy Wiggly, a Food Lion, and a Winn Dixie.
I saw “ Quit” and “Diet Coke”. And I clicked faster than James Charles can say “shore”
FIZZY
Just the fact that matpat was voting for harris teeter and not for coke a cola in the last two rounds tho
I call it “non-equilibrium-beverage”
"It is so *bizarre*" me: -JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE-
I’m Soda
yo who's never herd of food-lion
Matpat: diet coke is going to win this  harris teeter: you dare question my power
Soda
Uhhh we either call it drink,can or bottle no "soda" or "pop" . Like " what drink do you want?" or "do ya want a can?"
Okay so where I live in like my house we call it pop when it's like a 2 l but if it's like an individual bottle it's soda so I called it both pop and soda so I'm kind of in the mix between the two
Krogers ugh, a terrible company so I know what to look for and what to avoid.
I’m going to Ralph’s
I haven't had a regular soda in years but this is really interesting. The only carbonated drink I like is Starbucks peach passion fruit refreshers. Only place I can find them is Amazon, but I feel the same way about those that Matt does about diet coke haha
PEPSI IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY

7:36   I HAVE A SODASTREAM! The miranda is DEFINETELY the best one
I drank water while watching this and when I took a sip I could’ve swore for a split second I tasted coke, maybe I thought about coke so hard because of this video I accidentally tricked myself.
Soda. Because that is correct.   And I'm a New Englander.
all sodas are bad for me.
I am letter b
D: other   cool drink or just drink in South Africa but drink is universal like it can be apple juice or cream soda but cool drink is sodas specifically no other cold drinks 15:11

Me sees the title Also me:YES YES YES GOOD GOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!
I call it soda, as I’m from the middle of the county, but I live where they call it Coke, and it drives me mad to hear people say that.
23:18 I used to shop at a Kroger when I lived in KY, and I bought a Kroger "store brand" diet soda from them once.  I don't remember the fruit taste in it.
Cheerwine
It's more of a drink theory
Kroger: all cola are same, if not we’ll make it
I call it carbonated sweet drink
Soda
Matpat I feel your pain I drink 3 gallons of Diet coke every day I've been seeking mental help For 3 years now
I don’t think it’s a coincidence I got a Pepsi ad before the video…
When he says Harris teeter I’m like wait only North Carolina has Harris teeter
Meanwhile I'm over here in the UK, not a thing I can do to obtain this winner coke.
I don`t live in the US, and as a result don`t think I could ever experience that one soda Mat liked so much, but as far as coke and coke related stuff goes, to me coke zero is king (I prefer the less sweet taste)
The only reason I knew what food lion was, was because of Mrbeast
D: can of...
I call soda colddrink
I'm a Pepsi and mountain Dew guy
My parents would call it Poo poo drink
In Romania 'food lion' is called: Mega image
15:29 pop
The supermarket from North Carolina is present in multiple countries under different names. Food Lion, Delhaize, Mega Image, Super Indo and maybe some others.
Harris teeter Is the anime protagonist of this episode
15:30 I personally call all sodas jooze  Not to be confused with juice
Stevia is an acquired taste
Just tried Harris Teeter for the first time and it was mid-tier for me.
As a Coke Zero lover, I guess I should try Harris teeter?
No matter what you say it is a fact for me that fountain soda is best out of all soda and you can’t tell me other wise
Soda
bro's racist he said the N word look for it he said it 2 or 3 times
A pop
Ohhh maaan! I'd LOVE to send MattPat a Diet Cola from Food4Less so he could tell us if it tasted the same as the Harris Teeter stuff! Man it sucks that you can't trust other people on the internet to send you safe random bottles of diet soda;;
Wait a minute; ZERO CALORIES? aren't calories 'a measure of how much energy it'll take for you to burn off the food,' meaning that the coke just 'goes right through you undigested'?

Coca Cola used to have cocaine but it was so much that people would die from it. So they then added caffeine to the Coca Cola back in the mid/late 1800. Only for the second owner (the original owner died) to be arrested for false advertising bc they took away the caffeine for the same reason as the Cocaine. And the word. Coca meant caffeine and also cocaine. When they took away both of these they were arrested for false advertising
im sorry guys but its literally factual that diet pepsi is the most disgusting soda on this planet and your opinion that its good cant change facts that its disgusting
Soda pop lol
Wholefoods bizzare soda
Fanta > diet coke
Imposible !!!!!!!

Guys, the ending ad for me was a Diet Coca-Cola ad. THE ADS ARE AWARE. Also, considering I live in Canada, I automatically sit in Team Pop. xD
I am north Carolinian
D. In Australia we call it a Fizzy Drink, the Drink part of the word is necessary
food lion diet caffeine free is my favorite
Here in Israel we call it Cola
Diet Coke should have won:(
In the netherlands we call soda “frisdrank” en it literally translates to “fresh drinks”
Where I live we couldn't choose so we mixed 2 together and we now have soda pop 🤪
Diet coke is just coke with added more water.. Sugar addiction works like cocaine addiction... Sudden surge of massive amount of glucose in the brain given you the rush, but after the effects you'd get more sluggish & in more need of sugar, as a patient of adrenal insufficiency & prediabetes, I first had to quit coke & cake.. It wasn't easy, I often dreamt of drinking coke & after waking up I'd want to drink.. I could see clear only after drinking honey water only lasted for 10-15min as I was confined in ned, I was ill, I had to quit coke and I did.. my doctor told me I'm already half way there.. I'm still struggling, but I don't have blurred vision, difficult breathing, anxiousness now.. I can walk & work moderately not bedridden, I couldn't quit processed sugar completely, but I eat definitely less than before..hope I'll be able to get active like before..
C:coke
Why not get your own fountain? That pokey cola syrup is so cheap
Theory idea: is diet soda actually better for you than real soda?

Boylan is my favorite bottling company, but I’ve personally never tried the diet drinks
I don’t like diet sodas simply because of the fact that they increase your chances of getting cancer and I generally try to avoid things that are going to give me cancer
I live in Mississippi it makes brain hurt when you say pop
fizzy drink not coke not pop sometimes soda
Ha u'll injeced 1/3rd the amount of dr peper I injece 8 think
I call it soda pop😂 But sometimes soda. Never pop or anything else.
I grew up saying Coke since that is what we say in Charlotte,  NC
I was cheering for herris teeter the underdog

Fun fact: my grandmother used to work at a large dairy factory where they produced sliced and blocked cheeses. They packaged products for Kraft, Sargento, great value, and multiple other generic brands. When they needed to produce a specific brand, they would stop the production and just switch out labels. It is literally all the exact same cheese. So, MatPat, you are correct. That generic pasta is exactly the same as the name brand pasta.

Diet Coke Pepsi I swear to God
You know, I'd really love to see some sort of food theory episode regarding the caffeine free variants of soda and the impact on flavor. Aside from Coca Cola and Pepsi, caffeine free variants of other sodas are extremely hard to find aside from ones that don't have caffeine to begin with like Sprite. Heck I'd be curious if adding caffeine to something like Sprite would impact the flavor.  I'd personally love to try zero sugar variant of caffeine free Coca Cola or Dr. Pepper, but ordering online appears to be my only option and it can be EXPENSIVE. I don't even think a zero sugar caffeine free variant of Dr. Pepper exists. I'm genuinely curious as to why the caffeine free market sucks.
I wanna see this happen - But with fast food fries
There's a food lion where I live! :D
My Grandpa is both: sODa p0p
We call it Fizzy drink or just Fizzy in Australia
15:20 As someone who is from Georgia, I have never heard Cole used as a generic term for soda.
Anyone that thinks diet Coke is better for you or diet anything is better for you, is extremely ignorant I mean the fact that it’s a soda it’s already bad for you but if you actually read the ingredients a lot of the time they use aspartame and that’s actually worse than sugar and causes cancer the fact that it’s allowed on the shelves it’s disgusting
We call it drink
What have done with matt
Harris teeter for the win!
One day create a draw ingredient that looks like McDonald's but call it matponald's for matpat
Coke
as someone who’s lived in NC for over a decade and is dating someone who works at harris teeter, hearing matpat talk about harris teeter so much and say “you probably have never heard of them” was pure entertainment

Hey, matpat, I wanna share the recipe for Nuka Cola from my fallout cookbook, is it alright if I do?
I use Coke, Pop, Coke, Soda, and Fountain Drink randomly, mainly Fountain Drink, Soda, or Coke.
As someone who never drinks soda, this is fascinating in a morbid sort of way. Also, I am curious what reasonable alternatives exist to the "bracket" system, since this system resulted in two top-tier options facing off early, instead of in the final round.
Bro Food lion brand sodas are the best off brand.
If you ever come to Greece then you have to try the greek ''Green cola''. It uses stevia instead of sugar but the taste is REALLY good
you have made it possible to pin point your ex act location should have thought tat through
i have an obsesion with diet coke to and now i symathis now
Any native kansans out there excited about their local dillons probably having the same Harris teeter soda?
I say pop cause I'm from Michigan however there is an exception when it comes to grape soda.
B
Normal coke is so much better bro
Wait , so Matpat's real name is Matthew?!
Soda Stream is good if you add your own flavor, not any of their own.

Cool
b
When did you start drinking diet cook
Coke zero to is better
pop because im in canada lmao
I live in South Carolina and there’s a food lion down the road 😐
I wonder what tis the best tasting regular coke.
The reason boylan tasted bad is because it’s made of tree roots I believe, old soda was actually made out of the root of some kind of tree and it wasn’t the taste you know today Also Virginia has a lot of the “North Carolina based stores” in case you’re ever in VA and are looking for places to go
Diet Pepsi
I’m originally from South Carolina I remember having a Harris teeter, food lion and BI Lo in my hometown. Well before bi lo went away. I adore Publix fr.! Love you Matt and Steph! You two warm my heart! ❤️
Real men drink water
7:54
Did a test on Dr. Pepper and Dr. K (Kroger’s version) and found that Dr. K was so much better. It was cheaper, healthier, and tastier than Dr. Pepper.
Diet Coke man more like Harris teeter man now
Ok I'm from Tennesse but when I was 7 I moved to NC and we Always went to food lion but in Tennessee we have Food city (my uncle works at a food city
And yet he's always drinking can diet coke
Im from the caribbean and we say sea-drink or C-drink im not sure how to spell it but thats how its pronounced
Regular coke is different tasting out of diff containers too
As a native of North Carolina I approve this message
I like diet Coke via can... I cannot stand fountain diet Coke because there is no consistency and the taste is so different from the can. Is there anyone that agrees with me?
i grew up calling soda “blasty”
WAIT! What if the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty is citric acid?  "Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?" IT'S BEEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF US ALL THIS TIME.
Caffeinated water
the diet pepsi you held up is regular diet, caffeine free id a tan-colored can
same with diet dr pepper, cold and warm taste different
Good for you 👍🏻
I call them fizzy drinks
I say bubbly boi so other
I guess you can say Mat likes his soda fruity.
mat pat my man pop
I LOVE coke zero
Cok
pop poppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppoppop
Oh i call it soda pop.
My only problem with this video is that when Mat Pat says “so they must also bring zero to the table as well” the sodas all put something on the table.
There's no way food lions aren't common, I have 4 in my very small city
pepsi max is definitely the best, it has only 1 calorie and it tastes exactly like regular pepsi
I think because you know which sodas you are tasting, your results are scewed. To be more accurate you need to blind taste test the sodas. Just my 2 cents.
My mom always called all soda POISON🤣🤣      (I think you can tell the second I moved out of my parents house I bought a six pack of coke🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣)
i like how matpat turns into a wine taster by the end. like im picking up hints of fruitiness
12:09
Down in Australia we call it soft drink
Soda....pop
mattpatt vs dantdm
matpat did not just say the midwest calls it pop, im normal not a pop person
Soda, soda pop and coke (only Coca-Cola),
Two screen shots and now I can try to find what soda pop, cola… that took the Stanley cup of soda.
I was surprised when he said food lion was only a North Carolina thing, I thought it was something more national.
15:24 I have never heard that, I grew up in SC and we just call it soda
Diet coke has a subsistence in it where it makes you more hungry. A lot of my mom's family drinks it and they're all on the heavy side.
ughh as much as i lovee mat and lovee cola (prolly not as much as him ) i cant believe he missed thumbs up i swear its the best everr u gotta try it at leastt once also luv ur vids
If you really want to try something shocking..  Take a can of "Coke Zero" and add:   3ml of lime juice.   It makes the soda taste a ~lot~ more like "Coca-Cola".
Fizz.  New Zealand.
POP!!!
D: I am water because it's the healthiest drink
In the end all you need to do for the perfect diet cola flavor is ad lime slice to it.
wait... foodlion is north carolina based?
Stephs face! 🤣
This is a theory, that matpat will quit diet coke, but hey THATS JUST A THEORY
Water.
Fizzy good
I call it a fizzy drink
I got a Pepsi ad at the beginning of this video...
Pop 100%
I love this episode and I have a Harris Teeter near me so I can check it out but did anyone realize that they showed the bracket in the beginning and got most of the seeds wrong in the actual games?
noo shasta! i know it as the random soda found im my grandpas garage, and its pretty good to me. might be a little different recipie here, though.
what about  Aspartame that couses dementia later in your life  be careful with that
MatPat's moved onto another diet soda. Sorry Diet Coke. You should have noticed him sooner XD
Do you think Hannaford diet cola will be the same as Food Lion because they are both owned by Ahold Dalhaize?
Coke Zero Sugar! That perfect blend of synthetic sweetness!
cola is what i would call it
soda
Bepis or Conke?
fizzy drinks forever
I personally am super sensitive to artificial sweetners. They ALWAYS have a strange aftertaste for me that makes me gag. I can't have Diet colas at all because of that. It has to have sugar as a sweetner. I have tried Stevia, Aspertame and sucralose and even the dreaded Erythritol (urhghghg) and the one i found to produce the least chemically taste was Sucralose (splenda) but i still.. urghh
Did you waste any?
MIDWEST MIDWEST MIDWEST  POP POP POP
From Texas I say b and c, but Mountain Dew rocks do
Dude, they sharing straws...:)
Fun fact - In Germany "Diet Coke" is sold as "Coke Light"... yay!
I'm pop
nc mentioned?
So, I actually tried Harris Teeter after watching this when I went to South Carolina. It’s pretty good.
C) Coke is the only true answer. 😉😁🥰👍Pop is a father or grandfather. Soda is for baking or fountains. Haha
Harris Teeter should *definitely* sponsor you! I come from a Hard Core Diet Coke/Coke Zero Family. And now when I visit North Carolina, instead of grocery shopping at Super Walmart, I will intentionally seek out a Harris Teeter just so I can try their diet cola. Matt is the only guy I’ve known who was as hard core Diet Coke as my Daddy. I can’t believe he gave it up for a Year!  Well done. Sticking to your goals. Wow! 🙌 I’m betting you’ll be saving some serious money with the grocery store brand! Loved this episode! Love March Madness. And even better with your wife!
🤯🤯🤯🤯
In Spain we call them refrescos, and, as a curious fact, coke is called coca cola here. The official one.
German Frizz Kola Zero is the BEST Coke ever
Hehehe i live in north Carolina and the only two grocery stores i go to are harris teeter and food lion
im d we call any fizzy carbonated drink fizz
That's like literally hilarious how you know what two cokes you try, if you wanted to make this experiment serious you needed to make this a blind test from start to finish
food Lion The North Carolina Based grocery store you have you probably never Heard of  Me who  lives in North Carolina: i have!!
You need to try thumbs up it is literally Coke but sweeter better!
O- water
I call it soft drink
3:46 captions on. Hmm?
I quit drinking any soda, except sparkling mineral water. It has been 1,5 year.
B
funny, i actually dont find the coca cola "sweet". but that may be me being conditioned to it. its basically the only soda i can drink nowadays, aside bilz and pap in occasions. all the others taste way too sweet and i dont like them. i cant drink diet coke or coke zero because i get phisically sick, it upsets my stomach
it's harris teeter thank me in a year
Every time someone mentions a southern brand that's "obscure", I am reminded that Maryland is technically a southern state with how many of those things we end up having. 🤣

CHEERWINE 4 LIFE

22:22 hey we got that video. let's go!
I call it ether soda or just drink like did you get any drinks meaning soda
Watching This a year later and still seeing matpat drink Diet Coke not Harris teeter is sad
We’re i live its fizzy
Plenty of private label brands are manufactured in the same facilities as name-brand products. Also, it's possible to survive for several years on no water, only Diet Coke to drink.  Sources: Personal experience and personal experience.
ok, i just noteced this, but the first hot wings episode on film theory was published october 2020, and one of the things they tested was diet coke, and matpat sead that they had diet coke in the fiorge, so im just confused?
Im from NC and it warms my heart to hear harris teeter getting some recognition
Noooooo, stick with the diet coke!🤣
wait he lives in here so we got mr beast and theory boy cool
9:00 their birch beer is amazing. its like a rootbeer with a more minty after taste instead of vanilla. It goes great with chessmen.
4:22 but not glass bottle.
Just drink water. It's cheap and can be drank from the tap.
i ma an indian and we call it 'thanda'
Ima soda
In summary: 25 minutes of replacing diet cola with diet cola. Also just to make sure everyone is on the same page. Diet replaces the sugar with chemicals usually the three artificial chemicals. While there's evidence that drinking too much of these chemicals is linked to the big C; drinking in moderation is ok... if you like drinking artificial chemicals.
the swiss Goba-Cola ;)
Being diabetic since 10 years ago, I can tell that things with diet products might not be the way they promote it, so diet products really do what they are meant to promote "healthy" nutrition?.. Do Diet Soda really helps you to keep a healthy condition....🤔  No matter if they use sugar substitutes or not, I have a suspicious that they've got the same level of sugars than normal coke..
i just call it water
I like stevia in tea and coffee and chocolate and Zevia is flat out gross. Nasty.
1:12  Umm well
Mat: The Coke can’t have any added flavor Also Mat: Harris Teeter wins cause it’s fruity
Your bias about the Pepsi drink and that’s why it didn’t beat coke. This is explained in your video “Yes, the knock off is better”
Kinda funny how the FILLER soda, and the soda legit next to you is your favorite
Diet pepsi
Pop gang
this video was made on my birthday
fizzy drink
Australians call it soft drink we call it this because it was originally made as a substitute for alcohol
Only in america
So is there a link between theater majors and a love of Diet Coke or a theater Director I was in high school was very obsessive with his beverage as well
I started drinking Diet Coke due to medical reasons where u couldn’t have sugar then I moved to Coke Zero for my love of the Scott Pilgrim movie. To this day I’m still addicted to my Coke Zero and stand by it’s one of the best. Diet Coke has that strange artificial sweetness I personally don’t like. But that’s just my taste.
Which one does Mat love more: Wife or Diet Coke
Olipop.
“And this video is sponsored by Harris Teeter.”
coke is what I call it
Cola Zero Sugar is prob the best unlike diet coke it keeps the original taste while keeping the almost 0 sugar
boylan is one of my fav soda brands i didnt even know they had diet
Southern Ontario. Pop. Always.
an end to a legacy O7 O7
b
Diet Dr Pepper is the best tho
I got a Pepsi zero sugar add in the middle of the episode:)
I found a map of all kroger subsidiaries and apparently they dont have any locations in the northeastern part of the united states.
B
real question is the dude in red jacket wearing makeup
I remember as a kid we received like four dozen cases of diet rite soda for some reason and it was so disgusting we used it for target shooting instead of drinking them.
Diet Dr. Pepper dude, it's the best
D - other , here in Australia we call it soft drink
I cant drink diet soda, that lingering after taste kills me.
I used to pay people who visited canada to bring me back diet pepsi since their soda tasted way better than the american version
As a northeastern American, I was surprised to see you guys have a Food Lion in North Carolina. I have been going there now for a little while.
What about Pepsi max? That beats all of them
We have food lion in west virginia
I am a soda person mostly bc it is originally called soda pop and also soda just sounds right
In the robbery of coke you EVEN grabbed my heart.
I'm a new Englander, so I always called it soda
The name ofthe soda.Im not dumb
If I compare diet coke and Pepsi  It goes to Pepsi out of main line sodas (Diet Coke) is the absolute worst  However if you jam the zero sugars and the diet sodas in the same category Coke Zero is the best for me. Actually taste good. In the diet soda only though i like diet Dr Pepper  I like Dr Pepper anyway and the diet one taste the most Similar.
feels like  im waching chopped😂
Good choice on quitting
yeah i've had the sodastream cola its strong and dark and it tastes it..... idk how to discibe it almost kind of bitter very potent cola not much anything else and its not great, the cherry cola was aight, still simular though and this was before the rebrand so **shrug**
boylan makes the best rootbeer i've ever had would reccomend, haven't tried there cola, birch beer and rootbeer are VEEERRY different try at your own risk.
I'm b., my family and I grow up with calling them soda
In nebraska its soda and pop or sodapop
I only have coke with bourbon
We say lemonade instead of soda. It's weird i know.
pop
.
I have a addiction to coke and Pepsi
Everything is coke 🤷
Boyland is pretty popular around NJ, but I don't know who drinks it besides me. Not the diet cola one. But literally any other. Their Sherley temple is amazing!
Fizzy justice
Recently discovered you're in Raleigh, NC! That's so cool! I'm about an hour from Raleigh!
you made me thirsty
(Note that number 3 of my fav sodas is still questionable for me
My top 3 fav sodas 1:Sprite/any brand that’s close to tasting like it. 2:Fanta/Coke/ anything that tasted like it. 3:DP
*You're "aware" of what you're drinking?*  You should have done a double blind experiment in order to eliminate your psychological familiarity bias.  Bad science produces bad results.
This is the exact same thing that happened at the derby this year and I find it hilarious.
15:38 “diet sams club” lol
WHAT NO!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm e soda-pop
What about the glass bottle Diet Coke for the play in?
Omg matpat quits Diet Coke what’s next, the world is getting nuked, this only means the world is ending
i don’t know what it is but diet sodas just taste like flat(non carbonated) versions of the regular soda. Also the fact that artificial sweeteners cause the body to release insulin even though its not needed makes me feel that diet soda is more dangerous to me than regular sodas.
I always forget that Food Lion aren't that common. Whenever it comes up it just surprises me because my hometown only ever had a Food Lion and a Safeway. We used to have an Acme but they closed down. Harris Teeter cola is amazing and I am so happy that it made it through!
Some people say soda pop
in new zealand we just call it all fizzies
I’m bilingual and my answer goes Coke in English and Gaseosa in Spanish
Rootbeer and Dr Pepper are always my first picks no other soda comes close for me
pepsi is better than coke
I have SWORN by Kroger soda for years. Kroger does so good in the soda world!
Mean while me calling it soft drink
I’m drinking an orange Celsius with stevia and it’s lovely
Soda all the way
Diet Pepsi rules
Where I grew up in the north west of the UK we always refer to the drink by the specific brand (coke, fanta, dr pepper etc) and only when the brand is unknown or generic we call it a fizzy drink. My grandparents from Bury, near Manchester occasionally say pop but it is a word I have always associated with older people or rural areas. Soda is an almost exclusivley american term in the uk and I was incredibly surprised the first time I heard a brit say it, apparently it was normal in their specific town in the south but I do kinda find that hard to believe.
We call them Soft Drinks in Australia
The Zevia reminded me of a conversation I heard while in study hall some time ago. I ended up writing it down while adding some more to it.   K: S has a stomachache from drinking something.  S: It was Zevia.  N: You shouldn't have taken my Zevia, and then maybe you wouldn't have a stomach demon.  S: I'm sorry, I like Zevia.  N: Well, it's your stomach demon, and it was my Zevia.    Yes, this really happened. It was a bunch of theater kids.
I miss coke zero. It was different somehow.
Me who can’t drink regular soda
There’s a brand of drink called tractor beverages and they make 100% organic drinks and they have a “Diet Coke” called kola cola lite and it honestly tastes really good even with being organic
I got a Diet Coke add when I clicked on this and thought is was the video
Lucasade zero is the best
Nah man im a spanish speaker where i come from, its called  refresco.
Cola only

The Drink Theorists xD
For fairness, all of the contenders should have come from 2 liter bottles or 12 Oz. cans. Allowing fountain Diet Coke gave it an unfair advantage.
14:04 lol🤯
I call it D. other which cider
Soda and Coke
Hey Mat Pat do you live in Greensboro North Carolina
I'm pop
"Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that." 😂
Should have gone with tango
As somebody who has sworn off sugar of any form for years and really anything sweet for that matter including most carbohydrate sources or sweeteners in general, the only the only cola here worth considering is the zevias. Diet Coke and the like are unacceptable due to aspartame, which has terrible effects on your gut microbiome, phosphoric acid, which binds to minerals in your body which weakens your bones and the caramel coloring, which is very inflammatory.
cuz u quit diet coke, why not send me all the cans
I watched this a long time ago but I've since found the winner that you didn't try.  Summit brand Diet Cola from Aldi!  I am a Diet Coke addict and this is the best one by far.
Did some work out in Alexandria Virginia and no joke the Harris Teeter was our #2 spot. It was just a really nice market.   Don Taco #1 though. If anyone is within range of that city I implore you Don Taco on king street, get either burrito.
we here in europe call it a can of blank e.g can i get a can of pepsi?
I like calling it soda
B take it or leave it
Aspartame is poop. Diet Coke is poop in a can. I don't bother with diet drinks, they aren't really better for you, but I wish Coke had a Sucralose variety. I would drink that.
Pop is the ONLY right word
Matpat do you Know diet Dr thunder
from what I understand companies like coke and Pepsi will create bargain brand versions of their drinks that are sold by and owned by retail stores. so it is possible that the off-brand sodas are still coke even if they aren't coke.
In Ohio it's called BigK diet cola
no mat, I agree there is a distinct taste difference in bottle, can, and fountain. a fountain drink always has less carbonation and more sweetener, a can is usually a "reduced", and a bottle feels like it has way too much carbonation.
I've been liking coca cola zero lately. Tastes very close to classic.

In Egypt they generally refer to Sodas as something cold

coming from a NC native, cant say I'm surprised tbh. But also, I have never been somewhere that calls soda "coke" that's near where I live
soda

i sat it coca (like in the first part of "coca-cola")
Soft drink
Pop
Here in Idaho we call it soda pop
all the words are acceptable
Literally drinking Diet Coke and I saw this. This is alarming
If you do this again try sams cola if it’s available it’s a store brand and it’s one of the better colas I’ve tasted
What about the uk? Where should we go? I don’t recognise any of those brands
soda
Diet Pepsi is better
diet coke gives me a headache and makes me dizzy
I drink Diet Coke when I don't want coffee for the caffeine because caffeine temporarily helps my depression
I somehow haven’t seen any comments pointing out that there were three colas in the 7th seed (caffeine free diet pepsi, boylan and johnnie ryan) so I’ll say it
I grew up in SoCal. It’s all soda to me. Never heard soda pop or pop until I visited Michigan.
Is there one of these with Dr.Pepper, Dr. W, PIBB, etc...? Hmmmm
1 year late, but here in Scotland I grew up with “Fizzy Drink(s)”
Of  course you do not like Diet Coke being laced with Aspartine  where originally it contained High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Dr. Conseulor of former high President of Coke Corporation, was a chemical engineer. To make Coke taste like fully leaded sugared Coke, food Scientists have yet come to any discoveries. Sorry!
Bubble
i like that the ingredient that made the store brand win (citric acid) is the only food im allergic to :,)
RC cola da best
It would be easier to get all the syrups and put them through a bubbler. It takes out the variable of carbonation.
I’m not trying generic brand either way, because I don’t like carbonated drinks
I got a ad for Pepsi zero sugar lol
D: limu
Soft drink.
food lion? north carolina based? bwahahaha read a bit about delhaize group, it's one of the biggest supermarkets in europe
Come zero
This reminds me of the one time when I was 7 that I and my family went to North Carolina and they ended up going to a seafood restaurant and I ended up going hungry because I'm allergic to shellfish. It sucked, I hate North Carolina
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE REAL MATPAT!!!
coke zero for me
Oddly enough, here in Raleigh NC there are both Harris Teeter and (I think?) Kroger stores. I seem to recall Kroger sodas using sucralose instead of aspartame…but I could be remembering wrong. Or they could have changed it. I’ll definitely have to look into Harris Teeter sodas now.
us in the east or atleast were i live its pop
You should stop lying for clicks. It's annoying. You shouldn't drink that crap anyway because it has aspartamein it.
Imma coke gal 🤠🤠🤠
In my family, we called them sodees.
me over here not being able to touch diet sodas in the first place because of allergy. I am allergic to Aspartame.

The real winner is diabetes

I just found this and it is 1. a ranking video 2. about cola 3. chains that I am amiliar with. This was made for me.
Harris teeter has dethrowned coca cola
Citric acid is in the krabby patty formula
POP
I call it Sodie Pop. Yes, I live in Canada. No, no one else calls it that
You should have compared fountain versions of the competitors.
You should Try a Kofola but it's Only in Czech Republic or Slovakia
e
you just made Alex Jones proud
Soda or tonic
For the pop vs soda vs coke vs other.up in the south I do call it pop and soda at the same time.
Remember, there are theories out there that the reason in the pepsi challenge that pepsi beat coke whereas people might actually prefer coke when drinking a full can/bottle is due to sugar content--pepsi is higher so first sip feels better, but coke is better for full sized as the sugar start to wane off and build up and feel bad. Now, I have no idea if this is actually true. However, this would mean that sip comparison is *not* the whole story.  So to do this properly, you need to do a second round where you first desensitize/saturate yourself of the sugar, by downing say 300-500ml of whatever soda first. Sip test after that should reasonably reflect full serving taste preference.
I wanna know almost a year later, is he still drinking Harris teeter?
idk about us, but in uk diet drinks are struggling, even after the introduced sugar tax, which makes the non diet drinks more expensive. Personally,  I would rather drink sparkling water than diet coke, coke 0, etc. Also, imported coke and fanta are nicer (sweeter). uk fanta is almost sour, like store brand.
Soda
drinks or cold drinks
MatPat with Diet Cola is me with Coke Zero.
I am E, fizzy lifting drinks
From Australia we call it pop
Stevia is 230 times stronger than sugar so. 2 tablespoons equals 1 cup of sugar.
Let's be honest who actually thinks he quit diet coke? It's obvious he did this only for views
I love how I accidentally clicked off of the video when they brought up Pepsi zero sugar and then when I open it again that’s the add that I get💀
Argh this was a good video
Lol 13th seed, nah man that says 10th 😂
Bundaberg diet ginger beer. It's not sugar free, and the ginger punches you in the face.

Maybe citric acid is the secret of the Krabby Patty
I am diabetic, and I hate stevia. It is strong, it's hard to use ot even weith steong espresso coffee.  Coca-Cola diet was sh** back some 10 yrs ago, then they killed that brand (here where I live) and started with new formula and brand Coca-Cola Zero.  O boy was I happy when I first tasted it. Because competition was not near it at the time, or tasted the same, I stopped drinking soda beverages with saccharine in it, because it had bad taste. But Cola Zero fixed it.
"North Carolina based food lion which you have probably never heard of".... Me in Virginia, bruh we have thoes like off brand food cities XD
3:12.   Zero to the table
I'm stationed in North Carolina, looked up Harris Teeter and am headed straight there when I get paid
It's very unfair to use Fountain coke vs Bottled/canned sodas.... super Biased
im from Finland and here (or at least, what i have been grown up to), we call it limsa (some call it limu, some call it limppa), which is a short for limonadi, which comes from the english word lemonade (shocker, right?). but i pretty much only drink coca-cola (coca-cola zero to be specific), (which btw, here in Finland, is shortened as kokis) so when speaking english, im most often saying coke, but if i were to speak of the.. well, lemonades in general, i'd say soda. but i never really liked the term soda. here in Finland, sooda refers to the carbonated water. and im much more fond of the shortened version of lemonade, limsa. maybe i should start calling them by the finnish names limsa and kokis (or cocis) when speaking english :D but no one would probably understand what im saying :D
15:31 I'm a Coke person tbh.
hi
Mountain dew best
Sodypop
i want coke now !!
Prepare to have the fbi looking cuz u found the crabby patty secret formula ingredient
It's not diet but it can't be topped. Vanilla coke is amazing i love it, i snort it, i inject it, i drink it, i eat it. Vanilla is everything
Me who lives near a Harris teeter 😉

Everything is not coke in the south, it’s cola. If they do that, it’s just a NC thing. In SC, that’s just wrong.
Im a Fanta guy. sadly I dont think they have a diet soda.
In Ohio its just called drink lol
this is my favorite food theory episode idk why but if i see it i can non stop watching it
Soda>pop>coke
The reason fountain diet coke was the best was because mcdonalds has a partnership with coke and coke supplies them with a tastier syrup.
*S U G A R*
Coke or diet coke, both are unhealthy. I quit drinking those (despite I barely touch them in my life) and replace it with beer, which is surprisingly good for your health with a moderate amount. I drink like 2 cans of beer maximum a day, but usually 1 can a day, but like 3-4 days a week. Mostly I just drink plain water.
I thought he was living in California
15:29 Soda
I feel like if they waited they could’ve had a different finals result but then I feel like matpat would know what Diet Coke is and not the other ones
Now drink all of them at once!
I've heard of food lion (i live in a state close to carolina lol)
Matpat: no fruity flavors of diet soda. Matpat later: I like Harris Teeter because it’s fruity
Does anyone know what the song is when they're testing the diet cokes around 5:10
I don't drink diet soda EVER, so I think I'm gonna try and hunt down the regular version of the generic Harris Teeter cola. I'm sure it'll probably still have that sweetness and fruity finish to it. lol and it'll probably still break my wallet to get it on Amazon or something if I really want to hunt it down. But I'm sure it'll be worth it for me to save up for it. Though I also like regular Shasta cola (cuz I can get it from my local Dollar Tree anytime I want (as long as it's in stock) and I don't have to pay the sugar tax on it, just the usual 10 cent tax that comes with buying ANYTHING from the Dollar Tree). (^__^)
If you want to like stevia, I would recommend Gamer Supps - although they don't have a cola flavour, and some of the more popular flavours like "Blue Razz" (blue raspberry, whatever that is) and "Waifu Candy"(cotton candy, duh) don't taste right because of the stevia flavour, they have some great ones that either mask the flavour or complement it, like the raspberry and lime flavour "Guacamole Gamer Fart 9000" by Russian Badger, Dragonfruit, Mango, strawberry/blast/daiquidri, and probably a bunch of the others I haven't tried yet... and I guess, if you need it carbonated, you could use a machine like sodastream..
We don't have diet coke here ..
Pop
Diet??? u want cancer?
I just thought, was this a scripted event to make views?
lol             Yes          lol        lol   Yes    lol
lol
you shoud go to peru and try inka cola its very good
Shouldn’t drink the stuff. The Carmel food colouring is known to cause cancer.
I actually have been drinking big k (kroger soda) for a few years. I just don't drink diet. I can't drink much soda so I will put the open can back in the fridge and drink the rest a day or 2 later. You probably already know that name brands go flat almost immediately.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I went to drink big k the next day and it was still fizzy. I tested this and the big k sodas depending on the flavor can hold their fizz for days.  If you're really wanting to test if they're the same you could see if the fizz in yours stays after a few days.
I'm in love with MatPats wife.
Hi Matt! You probably won't see this, cuz this video was made forever ago, but I work at Smith's, a Kroger grocery chain. Our Big K diet soda is incredibly similar to your description of your cola, and I'd be willing to bet that you're correct in Kroger processing the same soda, and sending it to their subsidiaries. Very interesting! I'm a big fan of our Big K sodas.
At least you can still find Diet Coke. I prefered tab.
Soda FTW…
When you realize that he made and this wasn’t intentional but he just made a cameo for a future video which a bunch of you probably sans the crystal Pepsi episode
19:49 "it-its got that fruityness on the bottom" 💀💀💀💀💀💀
mat can i be both pop and soda?
There's a brand of "coke"  here (not actually brand name coke) that taste immensely like candy, like a coke chewing gum. It's not bad but it's kinda like drinking liquid candy..
We NEED a face reveal!!!
diet coke is actully really bad for you, sure tehy reduce calories but while trying to achive that they add so many more unhealty thing. In conclusion ur better sticking to the normal coke
i say pop im from canada
this is arguably an excuse to drink more cola without ppl caring, great job matt cuz when i first saw it i didint think about the fact that u have so much soda for this vid
Please do a part 2 on Kroger coke
D  I call it fizzy
try "faxe kondi" is a soda from Denmark that tastes amazing
I’m human
Glass bottle diet coke
lol kroger owns all of those stores
we call in soft drink in Australia
Am I the only one who is bothered by this but, WHY did you film this with the blazing sun coming through the window behind you?!?! It’s freakin’ blinding me!  :-0
B
NOT ME CURRENTLY SIPPING DIET COKE LOOKING FOR A CHEAPER/BETTER REPLACEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I needed to see this earlier
Let’s goo NC for the win
BIG K Cola OH! Zero Sugar from Kroger...Way better than Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar, and holds it's carbonation for way longer.
Soda
I went to my local king supers and I tried their diet cola and it did have a fruity after taste and it was pretty dam good
I dont know why but I really dont like cola without sugar
from indiana and im team coke
what i did to try stevia containing drinks was not having much sugar like less than 5mg every day maybe even less and very little to no aspartame for 3 or so weeks then i tried stevia in an unsweetened tea and i found i liked it and even now i can still drink coke zero and go back to zevia drinks and i love them both for the flavor. But that is just me however if you or anyone would like to try this and then comment what your outcome was i would be interested in seeing what other peoples experiences were.
B
Pop, its called pop
Woah, you live I NC aswell.  Didn't know that
fountain... idk but here in nz its rank as glass bottle tier 0 can tier 1 bottle tier 2 fountain undrinkable
did  u try green coke it is all natural and tastes good
I don't drink diet coke because i want to lose weight. i drink it because i like the taste.
Pop
Rc cola
Boylan rootbear is so goood
A
Citric Acid runs the world.
HARRIS TEETER YEAH!!!!
soda pop! only where I live everyone is French, but they don't know the actual french words for it so you have to say the brand name  Racinette is root beer. But you have to call it A&W
In a root beer connoisseur the classics are best for root beer lol
Drink sahlep.

it smells like cough syrup, because they literally sell soda syrup as a cough syrup.
Nah bro, Florida is part of Australia 😎
Me being British has only had 2 maybe 3 of these
love this channel
Ima POP guy
I hate diet Pepsi and I don't realy like zero in my country it tastes so much like diet Pepsi in general diet soda has a good start taste but the after taste is so wierd and way way to swet
it's diet pepsi or bust, man
As soon as you said "Food Lion," something clicked. I used to live in the Northeast but moved a few years ago. "Dr. Perky" was my favorite. Not the drink, the name lol.
Massively late but I can confirm that Kroger does in fact have the diet cola with citric acid in their Food 4 Less stores. Interesting to see, but I'll be giving it a try. It's very likely that it is the same to the one that Matthew and Stephanie had.
This is the most carefully crafted, intelligent insult I will ever know. You made a full tournament-based video to tell a cola company that you prefer a store-brand cola over theirs. You genius.
14:04 Rip left couch got slapped 2 times
Should have rinsed out your mouths between tasting soda's with water.
root beer will replace it
I'm candian so pop for me
Pepsi zero is my favorite, in Europe it’s called Pepsi max, always my fav caus it doesn’t taste like a diet soda, it tastes sugary, kinda syrupy but not really, idk it’s really good
B I’m a sofa man
Soda. Boyland cream sodas and root beers are my favorite sodas right now. Old Tyme was great but we can't gete it here anymore.
rip fry's man
We get Boylan in VA!! Absolutely love the cane cola :)
Am i the only one who feels that game theory / food theory has lore it self
Team "Soda".  To avoid the "spoiler" effect, it may have been best to have both of you sort them all blind and them reveal them all from last to first :)
Tab was always a favorite, sadly it got the axe.
MatPat: u guys down in the south are chaotic   Mea Southerner: at least we don,t ignore people because we don,t know them
We call it coke in Texas.
whaaaa y'all still have food lion?
Anyone else catch the scripting error at 18:02?
Surely if you are looking for a cola flavoured soda that is readily accessible to you, then your should have been testing a bottled or canned diet cola, because driving to somewhere with a soda fountain whenever the mood takes you is not environmentally sustainable or logistically sound? Arguably it is worse than driving to a store that doesn't have branches in your area and just stocking up once or twice a month
Getting strong Ginyu Force vibes with the rock, paper, scissors.
20:50 But that's just a theory, a food theory!
Pop
Diet cola drinks are also one of my vices. I think you're dead right when you say that different sources of cola taste different -- but I also think that drinking canned coke zero or diet coke tastes different straight versus pouring it into a glass. Especially the old flavour of coke zero (before they changed it in 2020 in the UK at least) seems to have a kind of "metallic" flavour when drank out of a can. I can't exlain it and it doesn't really sound nice, but I kind of grew up drinking it so I've got some of that hershey's chocolate "vomit" effect if you know what I mean.
😳😳😳😳WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
It's all coke. If it's root beer you still call it a coke. My grandma owns a roller-rink and if you want to get a acidic sugar water then you must ask for a coke or NO ONE knows what your talking about.
Pop
You could just put a lemon slice in your coke
diet coke is always good to matpat
It should also be noted that Zevia doesn’t have salt, which probably hurt it in the flavor department.
“Florida is in the southeast of the United States.”  Yes, but it’s also kind of a world apart from the southeast at the same time.
I call it Dèrnãmí
DR. PEPPER IS THE BEST!!!!!
I live 2 blocks from Pick N Save so gonna try. Also my whole family is from the North but lived in the south for about 15 years and my brothers were born down there so I use pop and coke
Pop, all the way!
I need to find this cola…. Harris teeter where are you…
Instead of March madness here on canada we have march mathness witch is for math :v

Just don't drink soda, drink water, be healthy :)
I am B
B no questions asked
I’m sorry, America has shops _dedicated_ to _SODA?!_ no wonder you guys are one of the unhealthiest countries in the world!
I work at dillons in Kansas and i can tell you while all of the sodas are formulated the same sertain brands have slight differences to try to get people to by the kroger brand
in the south of the uk we usually call them fizzy drinks or just soft drinks
I just freaking love MatPat's reaction to Harris Teeter
🤯 I worked at a Harris Teeter for Kurt over a year. Never once remember ringing up a store brand cola! We be sleeping on the HT Cola!
No sugar coke
This is a new era of MatPat we are witnessing here.
Honestly, the Publix brand is my favorite. That probably has to do with nostalgia though. That's the only soda my grandmother gets so when I would spend summers at her house growing up, if I wanted soda, that's what I would get.
over here we said the full name, cocaine
Where I'm from soda is called liquor
so that was a goddamn lie
Has anyone else realized that Diet Rite, and Diet Shasta Cola are both 13th seed. Kinda weird, Matpat. But seriously love ur vids. #TeamTheorist
Soda
I prefer to drink those flavored seltzer water Walmart sells for like 56 cents it keeps me off soda.
D: carbonated beverage
Liquid does not count as food...... ( Yes I searched it )
Fountain diet coke(macdons) > bottle diet coke > canned diet coke

The problem with mat and steph doing rock paper scissors is they both know the kind games of rock paper scissors
Coke. Im British. And i normally drink tango and orange energy
A:pop
i live in the uk and i call all fizzy drinks lemonade 😻
I'm D i use cola
As a diabetic I can tell the horrible taste of Stevia I had i had it and its so overpowering..
There was so many things that should have been changed to make this a better competition. For example reactions should not have started happening until each person tasted each soda, formed their own opinions and then discussed it so the opinions of the other person didn't affect the other persons thinking before they tried the soda, as that can lead to expectations and cause one to react differently than they would have because of the other persons opinion.
Fountain pop all depends on where you get it also. As Coke tastes best at McDonald's imo and other places can be pretty bad depending on where you get it.
I call it soda just because my mom doesn't like when I call it soda
2:52 - wait, since when is Dr. Pepper not a cola?
I’m anything but coke
I thought this was going to be a sciencey video about which ones healthier lol
I just bought a diet coke specifically to drink while I watch this video. Lol.
One that needs the rank is fentimans cola
When this first came out, I was about to join a zoom call, and I got the notification and I genuinely thought he was drunk or something
completely unrelated to the video: I asked my mom to guess mat's age and she said "between 18-25, probably."  💀
6:10 I mean she's not wrong We have a stupid amount of Publix(s) down here
i can’t believe you don’t call t soft drink…
I bet for the thumb nail you drank a full can of diet coke tipped it up and then edited the coke pouring out
You shouldn't know the brands or models untill you pick the champion.
I drink rootbeer and the store brand rootbeer is actually my main favorite. I should *probably* drink less
I called it "sodie pop"
Any of those no-sugar, no swertenrer,  bubbly water and a little flavoring drinks are my recommendation.  But  at home, when not drinking tree-bark tea, I go for water with vinegar and lemon juice.   Like they say in the prophetic movie, Idiocracy, "It has electrolytes!"
Who here believes you can never get enough of chicken nuggets
I would choose water
In india we sometimes add lime to pepsi and coke.Indian things.
Soda
we pop bois

I found one diet coke the same one in whole foods
D  Both Soda and pop
what's the difference between diet and zero?
The last point is very much true, I work at a small chain grocery store that's based in my state and blue bunny/ribbon makes our icecream
Try Pepsi
its a fizzy drink, not pop or coke or soda or anything else
i personally call it fizzy and for a lot of the brands you show in this video we don't get them over the pond in the UK but still very interesting video!
Kroger brand diet soda has a citris taste. East Tennessee here
cokacola zero perfect taste
I’m soda pop
where we live we call it soft drinks i know boring
fountain over can? uhf im REALLY disapointed.
Pepsi max
I didnt know Harris Teeter and Food Lion are North Carolina based, I have them here in Northern Virginia and never associated them with the south. I associate only Publix as southern and we don't have that up here near me
b
You drink coke and worry about sweetness? It's just gross Pepsi. Also, aspartame is only bad for you, if you drink 10 oz a day. That's 7 gallons of soda. Come on guys.
Sorry guys, you are wrong. Diet soda is only bad if you are having a source of sugar within 3 hours of drinking one.  It's a body trick.
BUY a soda maker!
In Australia we call it soft drink
Glorious Food Lion, I have that here in SC
Soda
Fanta
I miss when food Lion gave people stuffed anmails
just drink water like a normal healthy human
fountain coke? Really! In my country that's the rundown sloppy one no one wants. I prefer the glass bottle or can.
I say candy water
W-what if I’m in Australia though-
"Drink"
You should get a frozen diet coke from mc donalds its really good plz try it
I call it a Soder.
Harris teeter and food lion is in    Va
10+9=21
I drink thea
Thanks for the video, I actually have a Harris teeter in my neighborhood, never been big on store brand stuff, but after video I decided to try it out, was delicious. Which lead me to Kroger, across the street from Harris teeter 😆, but Kroger brand Cola Zero Sugar became my favorite Diet Cola
in India we call soda/pop   "Cold Drink" it is fairly weird
You need to try New Haven, CT’s “Foxon Parks’ Diet Kola.   Just saying…they don’t disappoint on any of their sodas. Birch Beer is the best
Soda DUH 🙄
In my country its called soft drinks😂
Harris teeter: *laughs maniacally* Yes !
fizzy drink
Here in Australia people call it all different things but I call it soda or soft drink
Yeah, Maryland has Harris teeter
Bing can we quit fizzy drink but in Portsmouth and might be only not in America
Im a lithuanian so basicly most of these i cant get
I would also suggest monkeyfruit if you want a more subtle sugar

When I switched from Diet Coke, my top 2 were Harris Teeter and Wegmans. We’ll need a follow-on video of that matchup.
I am so surprised

U guys should try Stevia in ice coffee / tea U can make them at home and there very good.
diet coke is healtheir than water because its diet

i introduce pepsi max 😂
Gotta agree with Mat, pop is what I call it. But I just say soda-pop because it reminds me of my grandpa he said it too. RIP grandpa
I grew up calling all sodas "Tonic" because that's what my grandparents called it. But, it's been edged out for just "Soda" now.
DIET DR PEPPY NOT DR PEPPER DR PEPPY
Hey take a visit to Wayensville NC right there in Smokey Mountains and visit the Waynesville Soada jerks
Soda

I don’t drink sodas so can’t relate.
Here In Australia we call them soft drink
"The world has ever tasted" well none of those supermarkets are in the uk so just "america has ever tasted" haha
Pop or Fizzy drink. UK here XD
15:30 I am A (pop)
I can't understand diet coke, it tastes like coke, but wrong, I prefer drinking a week old open bottle of sprite than it,
Well good for you cuz hardly anyone in my family can actually drink diet coke or anything diet because we do you better make sure you have a pretty clean bathroom it's not going to be very clean by the end
Fizzy drink/ soft drink
I am a fellow coke addict
Diet.Drpepper being put out of this genuinely breaks my heart as a diet dr pepper addict
D: other I call them by there own names
I hate like beggars. *Press this button if you agree.* 👇
Soda
Me:Sprite/Lemon lime soda Mat: Diet Coke
Glass cocke is the best
Ay bro just sayin i'm using mobile hotspot for this lol
I am other In Britain we call it either soft drink or fizzy drink
in the uk it's fizzy-drinks
Idk if this is consistent all over the Philippines but we also call items as the brand? and then when asked what specific brand we want, we answer the actual brand. For example, we go buy toothpaste. Some of us go, “Do you have Colgate?” but we’re not actually referring to Colgate specifically, just toothpaste. Thought that was cool!
Having watched so many of your vids, I don’t know the answer to this question: Have you actually quit Diet Coke and are now buying the Winner of your taste test? Or have you joined the rest of America and “reverted to type” by switching back to your original Soda Pop…  Yes, I say both Soda and Pop. I was unaware that Pop was a Midwest name and Soda belonged to the South. I may have mentioned this before, I don’t know where I wrote this story last, but… I went into a bar in Minnesota and ordered a “diet soda, no ice.” The bartender looked at me, repeating my order back to me with a bewildered look, and then proceeded to fill a glass with Tonic Water (no ice) and serve it to me. When I said “no no no, I want a diet soda pop no ice” he replied “oh a pop! Why didn’t you say so!” And then filled a glass with diet coke and served me that (they have Diet Coke on tap, and have Diet Pepsi in a can).

Rooting all the way for Pepsi!
In India we say coldrink
Harris Teeter diet cola was a true underdog story
in Australia we call it soft drink
If you think Boylan was weird, you have try Fentimans.
Some people like Pepsi, some like Coke, but I'm sure we can all agree that Undertale has the best soundtrack.

I say soda now, but I called it pop in the west of Canada.. and grew up in Texas calling it "coke"
My family loves zevia and it’s pronounced is  ze-vee-a
As someone born and raised in the south (Mississippi), I feel the need to state here that I have only ever heard people say “soda,” and the only time I have heard people talk about all sodas as “coke” is when my dad tells me that that was how it was where he grew up. He always calls it soda now too.

boutta buy some harris teeter stonks
I’m a southern that says soft drink 🥲
I'm a Classic Coke drinker. My favorite thing to do is buy some, put them in the coldest spot in the fridge and forget about them, then drink it when it's really cold. It's even better when it's in a glass bottle. I know what you mean by that back of the mouth flavor. I think I know what that flavor is. I think its clover combined with the citrus flavors.  Have you ever taken an orange and stuck clovers in it around Christmas time? That's what I was tasting. It's that combination of flavors. Maybe I am wrong. But that is what it tastes like to me.
Im A pop
Its soda in Alaska

I bet Harris Teeter saw an influx of Diet Cola purchases in the weeks following this video's release.
I've lived in Tennessee my entire life, I will go to my grave calling all flavored carbonated beverages coke. Except root beer, that has earned its name.
He just blasted me in the face by reminding me of harris teeter, i miss it so much
I call any soda bubbles
I live in the south but I go between coke and soda depending on who I talk to
You hit that dead on by the way I lived next to a kroger and I was able to get my hands on and send a Harris Teeter they're exactly the same it's weird
Harris Teeter must be so proud of themselves for beating Diet Coke
For the most part using the soda stream brand syrups is a waste of money and kind of defeats the purpose. But the device is still neat if you're into making your own syrups.
USE DEIT PEPSI
pepsi max is the best. figth me
Pepsi and Coke are the same drink, you can't convince me otherwise
Just drink regular Coke- Or Cherry Coke, or the Starlight Coke which is like Cherry and Chocolate mixed together
B
the rps part omg
"you people in the south are chaotic" sounds about right.
I am just gonna say that I have no idea that anyone else knows about "zeva" (gees, I can't spell).
Sodie pop, as the chaotic evil choice
diet rite also has no sodium :o
The ultimate advertisement for Harris Teeter
All diet sodas are garbage actually so either way you lose Matt.
If I can't have Dr Pepper Zero than Coke Zero all the way. Diet Coke tastes absolutely disgusting to me.
Another amazing video!
e
It's so weird it's called Coca cola now
If you're going to drink pop, which is junk food, why torture yourself with disgusting diet versions at all. All diet foods have disgusting aftertastes because they're filled with chemicals. Either enjoy your sugar or don't eat it, diet junk food is so pointless
Since the beggining I was cheering for a local one, any local But when I saw how happy u guys were on the Harry smth, I knew, it was the one
Food lion is in South Carolina too I live in South Carolina
Wait you use to live in north Carolina 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Waiting on the episode on Nutrition labels and how food companies can lie to the consumer on what the Kcal count for each particular food item in a store or restaurant
glad to know im not the only one drinking diet coke onlyy for the flavor
I grew up in the New Orleans area. I can remember a time when Coke was the generic name for carbonated drinks but at some point the term soft drink took over.
POP
Sad. None of those stores are near my area :<
4 choices. Pop, soda, coke or other. British people scream in fizzy.
in belgium its delheize
D: Cola
In Australia - I have always called it fizzy drink!
Hi
Good one I found in NYC at an Italian restaurant/store in the Oculus called Eataly called Mole Cola, worth a try!
I recently gave up drinking about 7 pepsi zero sugars/day.  It sucked, aspartame is clearly very addictive, and it destroys your liver. For a week after giving it up, I was peeing every 20 minutes, like it was the first thing in the morning.  It stank.  That was all the stored glycogen in my liver coming out.  I'm only drinking coffee, tea and seltzer now.  Feel a lot better.
i like zevia😀
fizzy drink in england
In the UK where I live i just call it a fizzy drink
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE ROCK PAPER SCISSORS?!?! I LITERALLY DIED LAUGHING!
Ultimate Cinderella Story
tbh diet coke is worse for ur body than regular coke... diet coke has way worse sugar subs to make it still taste sweet
I’m glad to know I wasn’t the only one who noticed a difference between Can/Bottle/Fountain Diet Coke. I’m also a Diet Coke head BTW.
Pepsi max hits different
You forgot glass cokes mat
We call it a fizzy drink in New zealand
lol you got the worst zevia flavor
hmm food lion i should run down there and try it never though it would excel
im spicy water
B: Soda
i would have to go with B. Soda
Defo pop
boylan diet coke is sasafras heavy its a sasfarilla
imagine if "other" was another word for pop. it would be: "Hello What Type Of Other Do You Want?" "Which Other? Hmm..I'll Have The Coke Please!" it would be so awkward..
Food theory idea: for my freshmen year of high school, in my health class I was told most diet sodas are actually WORSE for you than regular sodas. Because of all the extra artificial sugars they add to make it taste the same. Diet Coke included.
So a funny fact about stevia (execpt that you have to use it very carefully because it is very strong), about 1/3 of the worlds population taste it differently because of genetics. For some reason it tastes more like licorice to them.  So yeah, I can imagine that Coke with licorice is not a good tasting event.  (for context: I asked this question to a health expert about a drink, wondering why they used sucralose instead of stevia, when stevia is the much healthier choice)
Soda does disgust me. Though I am morbidly curious about what MatPat has come up with.
we don't call it cocain blast liquid
I think the answer is let her keep her cocoa cola zero and mat his harris teeter soda. It won’t be too much soda at least.
MatPat makes soda vid  Diet coke: oh easy victory MatPat: Harris teeter wins Diet coke is second Diet coke: wait what
ITS THE FRUITYNESS OF IT

I just call it the name of the drink. so if I'm talking about Dr. Pepper I'll say Dr. Pepper.
Pepsi max or Pepsi sugar free
I live in the south (Alabama) and I have heard that others call it coke but never experienced it. We just call it soda. My favorite is Dr. Pepper, no one can tell me otherwise.
1:32 But monkey see monkey do mat pat!
So, he didn’t get the coke sponsorship then?
Well I'm Canadian so it's generally called pop.
Is this matpat eneamor  /:
a bit late to the names but here in Central Scotland  - D - Other (Ginger or Juice) both meaning fizzy drinks and juice not meaning fruit juice.

I drink at least one can of diet coke a day :)))  I cannot stop
I live in NC just less than 10 minutes away from a harris teeter. Imma go get some harris teeter cola
14:50 pause during this time
Anybody else notice how there are three 7th seeds in the bracket? lol
Virgils zero is great plus way more healthy than sucralose junk! Stevia and monkfruit sweeteners.
I tried Diet Coke before and I really like it. It’s good
soda
regular coke will probably be my downfall lol, i just cures my bad vibes by 20%
So actually, if you go to Gulf Shores in Alabama there is a diner that is 1950's style and on the drinks menu there is a Sugar Cane Cola. That is what Boyland uses. The natural sugar makes it sweeter so it makes it kind of bad. it would be good for someone with bad taste buds.
Tab?
my fav cola is coca cola zero idk if its only in denmark
I have never seen the actual march madness, but I've seen many march madness themed yt videos (hi gmm!). I'm always so confused as to why the "no. 1 seed", the favourite to win, faces off against the one least likely to win, here the "no. 16 seed". It feels really unfair 🤣🤣.
I can't stand diet anything. Aspartame just has a lingering metallic somthing. That said, really good episode.
the reason the fountain tasted better is because the machine was not cleaned and so it was filled with sticky excess sugar/sweetener that added its flavor to the cola. its also possible that the machine was used for real sugar and that is why you think its better because its contaminated with real soda.
0:17 it says loner ,the one thats supposed to say "hello internet"
me in Australia: :(
Ralphs and Kroger are the same thing
everyone I know and ever seen (including myself) have called it 'soda' because all of us down here in Florida are actually normal
I'm in Florida, and we call it "Soft Drinks"
Steph’s shock face is just so genuine 🤣🤣
Isaiah 41:10 (NIV) "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God 😁😇❤
I loved Kroger in Michigan... I Live in Clayton, 35 min south of Raleigh. The Teeter has been my fav for a while. Not shocked now..
I grew up calling soda "fizzys"
As a fellow North Carolinian, I am so proud of little Harris Teeter getting the win
Here in northen Mexico we call it Soda. But in the south they call it "refresco" which means refresher.
in case you didn't know, Virginia also has food lion. every time i go i get their soda and it tastes SO GOOD
I’m pop I may have been born in Tennessee but as of right now I spent most of my life in Minnesota
Here in NZ we call it fizi weird huh
Invest in Harris teeter now
Mattpat: oh it's terrible  *continues drinking

The clouds don’t rain sofa drinks. Meaning biologically 🥤 sodas are not a sound choice.
you forgot fanta
*angry kroger no in Ontario sounds*
he forgot glass bottled coke and mexican glass bottled coke
Other. Over here in New Zealand its called fizzie.
Really no RC Cola?
Mat pat messed up at 18:03 he said that Harris Teeter was a 13 seed but it's actually a 10.
I'm say pop instead of soda, I went down to Mississippi for a vacation and when I went out to eat my waitress said, "What kind of coke do you want?" and I replied with, "I don't want coke, is this some sort of scheme so you can sell more coke or something?" and she replied with, " *sigh* your not from here are you?
lived in the south for over 20 yrs and none anywhere has asked me "what kind of coke do you want?"
C all the way
15:28 well im glad you asked… we call it a „napój gazowany”
In Oz we call it soft drink (makes no sense)but that's it.
In Australia we either call it a soft drink or a soda
15:29-15:34 I'm going with d because  I say soft drink do you say that🤔🥤
The new popularmmos
I already quit on diet soda as a boy since I know they contain aspartame. Stevia would be a great sugar alternative. Stevia is a leaf.
soda for me
so its not just me who thinks diffrent sorces taste diffrent
Pop
Fun fact: there is a local cola brand near me called Freeway that I have actually never tasted
Where I live it is soft drinks. Although we never really say soft drinks unless you are asking for a menu. We normally just say I like coke or sprite or iron bru.
D I E T   C O K E Btw fun fact people in india call soda  and i quote "juice" pretty regularly
No way, I deliver to Publix in the Raleigh area, I’ll keep a sharp eye out for you guys and say hey. So if dude in a Boars Head uniform gives you a wave you’ll know!
BYE
Another fact video I am I am out I know increases your dieing chance

I don't drink cola
For years I've sworn that there's a noticeable difference between the same kind of soda in a can vs. a bottle and nobody ever believed me. I feel vindicated.
In Britain its fizzy drink

Personally I'm a sprite fan 😻😻
How about Newest Coke Zero?
From your discription, the taste of that off brand coke could be similar to Vita Cola witch is a Coke from the time when East Germany was seperated from the west.  That was my first Coke with this citrusy flavor wich made it a bit more refreshing than "normal" Coke. Nowadays many little brands like Afri coke, Fritz Coke, Liba coke and so on are flavored similar because it gives those a bit of a unique Flavor without feeling too abstractzing from Pepsi or Coka Cola.
It's not "pop".  It's soda.  How do we know?  Because it says "Cream Soda" right on the fucking can. It doesn't say "club pop".
I grew up with coke and as an adult I now say soda
i am watching this video exactly 366 days after it was uploaded.
Yo he got zeva my favrorite cola soda!   lets go my people! who else likes zeva cola flavor!
Is food lion really North Carolinian!?  We have one like two minutes away from my house in South Carolina!
Moutinho do you shed dranck it
Why don't you use regular Coke instead
That lasted all of 2 minutes.
A
Impossible
Okay. First you say that the diet colas must be available for purchase consistently. Then, you choose the diet coke which has the best flavor. That is inconsistent with what you first said. The diet coke to be compared to the others should be in the form you consistently purchase. If you regularly purchase cans, then the canned coke should be the compared version. Fountain diet coke should not even be in the running unless you have one of those soda stream machines and you regularly make your own diet coke.
B
Diet Coke is what you live for I've been in answers from Scott cawthon for fnaf
A
CokesoPop
So where I’m from everything but water is called juice; then if you want like soda/ pop you just say what flavor. Like:   “do you want wawa (water) or juice?”   “Juice.”   “Okay what kind or flavor?”   (Insert whatever) “coke, apple juice, sweet tea etc.”
The soda in the glass bottles are the best
Soda or pop is what we say here, coke here typically refers to coca cola. Go to a fast food place and ask for a coke you're getting coca cola.
The Gordan Ramsay of soda.

Called pop in Ohio
Soda
I'm watching this video at the start of the march madness
There soul mates
Boylan is pretty good actually definitely a older taste not bad in my opinion…the regular cola at least that’s the only one I have a reference for
okay here in new zealand we call it fizzy or what it is
In my opinion the only reason to drink soda is to mix it with booze
Fountain always wins.
a i call it pop
What about me :(
I love your dynamics with each other 😊
I'm soda, California  south tip
Cola
that would explain why Kroger is the best here...
The HT is the same as Krogers
We call them soft drinks or coke in Alabama

I literally just call it the brand but im british so
14:56 Wow , a "Local Romanian" Grocery store called Food Lion or better known here as Mega Image edged out Diet Pepsi And i thought Food Lion was a simple Local Grocery store only in Romania , but seeing it edge out Diet Pepsi , now we got a new Daily Customer Food Lion
Dang
That one moment your call cola and you say fizzy drink
me who lives in Virginia who knows what food lion and Harris teeter hahahahaha i know illegal  things
Collar oh from Kroger is a solid replacement store brand
I drank a 32oz fountain Diet Coke almost everyday for the past 2 years, but once I got pregnant the taste changed and I can taste all the chemicals in diet drinks and the flavor is different, I’m happy getting pregnant got me off drinking chemicals. But this was fun to watch! McDonald’s had the BEST Diet Coke.
For those of us in California, Ralph's Big K brand is the same as Harris Teeter

d: other. i call it fizzy drinks or soft drinks
Drink coke
8:03 Coca Cola was actually meant to be medicine in the 1st place
My class is doing a march madness reading comitcon
Sodas in glass bottles taste batter than any other form of soda in a cup tbh
As someone who went to college in NC, yes, I have heard of Food Lion and have been there.  Same with Harris Teeter.  I wonder if the Boylan one tastes similar to Diet Moxie.  Moxie is one of those sodas that is an acquired taste.  I personally think it’s gross, however my brother likes it.
Other
For me the word for soda is Coke. SOUTHERNERS!!!

Ok
dr. pepper is the best
soda
How could a fountain drink even be in the competition, they aren't consistent at all.
Is it still your favorite?
In my opinion fountain diet coke is the worst. Maybe its just the restaurants I have around here though Edit: it WAS the restaurants. I went to a few more and the diet coke was good
FDA says you can drink 55 diet cokes a day and there be literally no inexplicable side effects. They dont know above that

The only thing my mother drinks is Diet Coke so this will helpful and interesting
Going go my local food Co to find the diet cola

You should do a video about addiction to diet coke, yes it exists, I used to drink a lot of diet coke and had massive depressive symptoms from withdrawl for the two weeks I went from 5 cans a day to 0.
This thumbnail grabbed my attention much quicker than I imagined considering all other current events.
Australia is soft drink soooo
I saw this video and physically stopped
I am all actually when it comes to naming these drinks
Other and its fizzy juice
I'm D because I am from czech so i will always call soda "limonáda".
my favorite is pepsi zero sugar
other: fizzy
It's that matpat Polarises controversy then it's about the diet coke
Citric acid does make a big difference. I often add two or three drops of lemon juice to diet soda. It cuts through that fake/flat sweetness most diet soda has.
D:other. i call it fizzy ... cause it fizzes .... yeah.
Born and raised in SC, but it's cola. Not coke, not soda or pop.  It's a cola bean flavored carbonated beverage. Maybe I'm just too literal, but the most "location based" term I use, and use as little as possible, is "y'all" bc, you know, I possess a brain. 😊 LOL
D: other, Pepsi is so prominent in our house that we use it as a broad band term for all soda!
Pepsi for caffeine
lest go matpat can drink gallons of diet soda and say it was a drinking expense
i think matpat would be the fun uncle at the family reunion
BEER.   Many years ago I worked for a company that not only gave me FREE BEER; I was also part of a 'tasting experiment' The results were kinda odd...  The company's brand recipe was NOT the highest rated.  But, they stuck with the recipe...  So here is a theory that should be tested: Is a 'cheaper beer' better than a 'hand crafted beer' vs..  THE BIGGEST SELLING BEER IN THE WORLD (: Of course, you have a family .... so drinking a lot of beer is NOT a good idea.... OTOH....  this project might allow you to hang out with other peeps O_o On the gripping hand;  TASTING BEER is not the same as getting drunk.  And I noticed that both of you said "tastes like cough syrup" which has alcohol" in it...  ever seen that "I Live Lucy" episode?  I Digress.   Anywho...  I'm curious about you doing a 'theory' on CHEAP BEER vs. EXPENSIVE BEER.  Which TASTES BETTER.  Sadly, the best tasting beer (IMHO) no longer exists.

I don’t ever drink Coke, because I’m a Sprite person.
before I watch this I think it will be pepsi
In the uk at least for my family it’s the same as the south where we will call it coke also Pepsi max is the best cola ever

we call it coldrink here in india loL

I actually love boylan cola but only as a mixer in cocktails.
Me from 1 year later: the funny thing is that even in the thumbnail matpat probably threw the diet coke in a cup or something to not waste it.😂😂
This is every kid's dream!
I haven’t drink any pop soda since 2019

Coke zero was really chemical-ly when it first came out.  It's much better now.
You're comparing fountain diet coke against bottled publix cola.  To make it fair, both sodas should come from the same source.  Not that publix would win, but still.
YOU DRANK LEEEEEEEEEEEEEAN if you dont know what lean is its when someone mixes cough syrup with soda to get high and lean is very bad for your heart
You needed to include glass bottles They distort the flavor less
Soft drink
16:58 "you said bc its fruity??" ✋💅
I call it pop usually, but there are a few I call soda, like Jones or in-house brews from a restaurant.
I'm only 5 and a half minutes into this video, but this is the biggest stunt a man has ever went through with to get a coca cola fountain tap in their home.
If you want my opinionc diet sodas are a waste of time.
Once I drink a can of zero sugar Coke and I like it, my brother ask if I'm becoming MatPat.
Is Pepsi MAX not a thing in the US? it could just be the high caffeine talking but it's really good 😁
Pepsico isn't much better of a company, but as a Coke guy I have to regretfully admit that Diet Pepsi is way better in a cocktail. The excess sweetness gets mellowed out to create a better drinking experience. Diet Pepsi + Vodka IMO.
Our Kroger supermarket is Dillons and that is where I do my grocery shopping. I have noticed that the Kroger brand tastes just as good as the main brands and they are cheaper. Walmarts generic brand tastes bad. There are also other benefits to shopping at Dillons.
i really wished he hadent made this video because there are no more det coke jjokes now * sigh *
Awsome
9:23 I'm pretty sure we have that down here in Texas, but I might be thinking of something else
Calling soda "coke" is like calling water "dasani"
Try Sundrop and it will change your life!!! (Edit)Never mind,  if you're in NC, you definitely know Sundrop. 😂 Also RIP Harris Teeter.
B soda
What is worse for you, Diet Coke or regular Coke?
20:35-21:07 please why was this part so funny to watch omg-
Shure I live in England but everyone here just calls soda by there brand like Dr Pepper coke or Coca Cola and Pepsi though I think if you go to a restaurant it’s always coke or Coca Cola to be fare it’s most likely because it’s the most popular or they are just using the flavour instead

Every drink will vary in flavor based of the source, why do they specify about it being diet coke?
As a guy working from the inside, big K diet cola is the only one I would drink. I don't drink diet soda, but it goes down better for me
Aspartamalso can cause cancer
it says pepsi caffeine free is 7th seeded but boylan bottling was also 7th seeded and johnnie ryan was also 7th seeded.
Matpat: SPONSOR ME DIET COKE I'M BEGGING YOU! Matpat years later: Oh, so it's a war you want then…
in NZ it's fizzy/bubbles like "what fizzy do you want?"
It’s pop
As someone from the south, that whole thing Steph was saying. Never heard it before, everyone in South Carolina call it's Soda lol
soda
Heck yea food lion
Drinking a Diet Coke right now. Enjoying it.
I don't think I have ever seen any of those Kroger stores around me...
I live in Canada, where it's usually called pop, but for whatever reason everyone around me always called it soda, so I grew up calling it that. Now I'm trying make myself more Canadian, and part of that is training myself to call it pop.
i say coke but in dutch ( coca ... )
Hi
15:11  As a southern person, I laughed TOO hard at the: "...what coke you want?"/"Dr. Pepper" as I've had this EXACT conversation 100K times.
I want to be known as the place that we called soda pop but we call it soda welcome to Wisconsin
Whoever is making this soda should pay attention- they could turn this into a big name brand.
Limea
Soft drink
I've been a pepsi/dr pepper person,  and so their 'diet' version is also my fav.
So it's official, Mat likes things that are fruity 😏
My parents are ona diet so the only soda the drink are Diet Coke diet pepsi and diet red bull
Here's the thing though, you're not going to get Harris Teeter Cola at pizza hut any time soon, so diet Coke still wins
Drink diet pepi
Pepsi Max not even close
IT IS FUCKIN POP
I've lived in the midwest my entire life but everyone calls it soda here, very very few call it pop. Makes me wonder what part of the midwest calls it pop because it certainly isnt nebraska and kansas
Welp. As a current NC boi, there is like 10 harris teeters near me. So ill be stocking up soon.
i just call it all of the above
Fun fact ,even if it says on the label it can't be 0 Calories. Look it up.

Diet Coke is great out of a fountain like at Wendy’s, but the bottled/canned formula is weak.    Diet Pepsi used to be horrible, but they changed the formula years ago.  If you’re stuck drinking diet, Pepsi is it.
soda
I’m a Dr Pepper guy I just can’t stand the taste of Coke
im Canadian so its pop we also at least in Ontario don't have kroger
You're not making up that plastic taste, the acid in the soda is actually breaking down the plastic in the bottle so the soda actually contains some plastic particles and chemicals which is why it is healthier to drink out of glass or metal. Also, the Boylan soda tasting is actually healthier for you, but it is a bit of an acquired taste.
I am a c
Cola, to me, tastes moldy. I can't drink it. My wife is addicted to Pepsi Max. I drink cordial.

Beta males drink vanilla cola. Alpha males drink diet coke. Omega males drink kofola
i found the best drink they call it WATER
So here is something about Stevia, a personal anecdote. I once tried to make brownies with it. It did NOT go well. I looked up the Stevia to sugar ratio to get how much Stevia to use and made up for the less dry ingrediants going in the mix with more flour and Coco powder ect. Slapped it in the recipe as you do. And something.... was wrong.... I baked it, as I normally do. and... The "brownies" if you could call them that... began to... leak? Something about Stevia, I can only guess, makes them not mix with butter at ALL, cause that was the only wet oil thing in the mix. What I ended up with was... this chocolate-ish sweet but kinda burnt hard tack coated in a thin layer of oil from all the butter that (while perfectly blended in to the mix mind you) melted and FLED FOR IT'S LIFE AND LIBERITY from the Stevia. it (the butter) REFUSED to stay mixed in with the rest of the dry, and Stevia is the only difference really in the recipe. When I pulled it out of the oven it was just the choco tack in a puddle of melted butter... I don't do chemistry, and I don't believe in god. but that day I knew as far as baking went. Stevia was the work of Satan or an evil scientists mad machinations. Don't use Stevia for baking. It will only cause you suffering. or at lest, use the recipes of of those brave souls on the front line of the oven who shed tear and took great pains to find out what if any baked goods Stevia works in.
Imtereating factoid, light beer gets its light name because of its reduced calorie count. Convinced that men specifically would'd buy a diet beer, beer makers instead called & marketed it as light beer.
harris teeters always been the big nice store to me i never knew it wasa small chain...
why be told what the 2 are kinda defeats the purpose
Big k (the Kroger brand) sodas are actually good I need to try the diet cola one though
I'm a soda person. I don't understand calling everything coke, just confusing.
I live in the south, but I say soda pop
grew up with it being called fizzy drink
And then to consider that Harris Teeter Cola came in a plastic bottle, which was the worst performing container for Diet Coke.
while watching this I got rickrolled by an add.
Why would u go to all that trouble and not clean ur pallet after every taste?? Such hard work wasted , come on dude ur better than this
Cool or cold drinks
u missed lean :/
Watching this channel has really expanded my vocabulary. I love it!
harris teeter got sold D:
DEIT pepsi is 0 calaries and t almost taste like diet coke
You. Made the soda street wrong if it taste like cough syrup
interesting thing for me is with coke zero being as widely available, would fountain coke zero beat out fountain diet coke for matt.
*“Diet cola is best cola”*
Me: I’m gonna see if I can buy haris teeter! Also me:*checks the supermarkets* noooooo there aren’t any of those in Dubai!
I like coke zero

I found your winner at Smith's under the name "Big K."  It is delicious and is now my favorite soda beverage.  This is all thanks to this video.
Coke is a toxic chemical disaster.

How can you go with fountain soda though? Not like you're going to be able to have that as your primary source at home anyway?
I’ve only tried one type of diet soda which was diet Mountain Dew and that was ew as frick
in Australia we call soda soft drink
lol diet shasta....in case you're trapped in a hospital ward
Look into Cott beverage
0:07 I need to find a gf that looks at me the way she looks at him
Thanks to you guys today I'm going to get for lunch fried chicken and Krogers soda
not mat pat getting me addicted to all of his theory's but also diet coke THEN HE QUITS DIET COKE!!!!!!!!
Diet soda kills your brain cells
in the uk we call them fizzys
I know this isn't suppose to be suuuper accurate test, but I think one mistake they did is that they didn't drink water before trying a different coke, this would cleanse their pallet and make sure that one taste doesn't have an effect on the other one.
C: Coke
Soda
Seriously??? Has anyone there ever said “soda pop”?! I can’t be the only person in the world who has ever referred to or heard other people refer to soda products as “soda pop”?!
Seems a lot like a grandmas boy
What’s his boyfriends name ?
Should also stop the soy ,,, this boy here  is the answer to population control
Are you sure About that???
fun fact: actually diet soda is worse than normal soda for your health
We call them soft drinks here in Indiana
i live in va and i got a food lion right by my house… good soda lmao
My brain just exploded hearing mat say that about the diet coke being 2nd place.... 😲 who are you and what did you do with our favorite theorist??? Lol. Although the soda pop i stalk is mountain dew
I saw this title and was all WHAAAA?? THATS LIKE.... NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE!!! 😲
Like its very imp to drink cola everyday ... Like why these companies fills you're brain to use thr products on daily basis ?

I watch Sith the 14s time
You have so much variety out in USA. We in South Africa really only have Diet Coke and Pepsi. And some other shop brands but nowhere near the amount you have. Very interesting.
We used to have food lion in Florida.
I dunno whats different cause i live in illinois (in the midwest) but never heard the word pop uttered within 10 miles of soda
Why he drinking diet drinks in the first place-

As a Diet Dr Pepper enthusiast, I'm a really big fan of Kroger's Diet Dr. K. Unfortunately, they don't seem to sell it anymore and I can only find Dr. K Zero Sugar, which isn't the same.  Either way, it's less than half the price of name brand and with the amount of pop that I drink, it actually makes a meaningful dent in my budget. Which is sad, I admit.
I'm a soda guy
YES HARRIS TEETER LEETS GO!!! 🎉🎉
I'm sorry who in the Midwest calls it pop besides old people and when I say old people I mean 60+
I've never had Boylan's diet cola, but I love regular Boylan's Cola. You can taste the separate ingredients. It's not just a carbonated sugar delivery system like most sodas.
Same
Good for you comment chain?
everyone says its pop or soda but me being over here just calling it fizzy drinks😳
I dont drink alot of soda but I cannot stand diet soda's the fake taste is just to much for me
Now i want to buy a harris cola lol...
Fun fact normal coke is healthier then diet coke
Diet Coke is revolting, give me Coke Zero any day.
Wather
both of them have such similar facial features lol, matpat basically married the girl version of himself
Get mexican Coca Cola Light... It's the best.
I haven’t drank soda for seven years now but you guys made me want to try that Harris Teeter cola. Thank God, they don’t sell them in our country.
I bee
An interesting video, though I must admit I would drink Kombucha over any diet soda. In Australia we call it soda and by the specific brand name or flavouring. Coke is Coke, Pepsi is Pepsi, Fanta is Fanta. Generic/supermarket branded Coke is Cola and Fanta would be orange soda. In Australia we use cane sugar in regular soda and it tastes a lot better with it.
and you still drink it to this day
Drink theory
Sam's Choice (Wal-Mart) regular cola is the "New Coke" formula from back in the day...
Here in Australia, people say "soft drink", I suppose that's opposed to "hard drinks" with alcohol.
I noticed that there were like 3 different 7th seeds colas. Boylan (7:05), Diet Pepsi Caffeine Free (9:08) and Johnnie Ryan (12:55) were marked as 7th seeds.
Diet Soda Tournament arc.
I like how some random guy is talking about other kinds of coke, when so many people are talking about what should i drink.
Please try body armor coconut drink or bai coconut they are delicious and im using to replace a soda habit. Also good for you i think.
Soda
I moved around a lot and they said different things so I ended up just saying sodapop
I’m soft drink

Fun fact diet soda replaces sugar with aspertan but aspertan is a nurotoxiin so you are drinking posion oops sorry
15:28 im more of a "Pope" or "Cok" kinda guy
Pop
Umm food lion is not american though? It's literally the logo of the Delhaize group which is a multinational belgian store chain.
Fun video, the irony is I hate diet cola, haha...
For British it’s fizzy drinks.
Idea:diet water
British is good
I import Boylan cherry cola to Japan and I'm not even american
I was not ready for the wake-up call that other people have never heard of food lion
im pop
I'm from the South where we say "Coke" instead of "Soda" or "Pop" but I'm way more upset with how y'all play Rock Paper Scissors.  It's on three, not three and then go.
In the Philippines: It's soft drinks, lols
Cola, by it's nature, is orange plus spices.  I feel like Coke Zero, which the Harris teeter Cola imitates, leans into the orange.  Diet Coke goes for a milder flavor, and Coke Classic leans into the spices.  That is how my brain organizes it.
Also what's messed up is I cant have citrus acid T-T it messed with my stomach I have acid reflux
Cancer incoming
What's wrong with Coke Zero
C. Fizzy Drinks ... welcome to Australia

You must like brain cancer. Diet Coke has aspertaime
I travel to the US a few times a year from South Africa. I love Diet Coke. But the taste difference between the two countries is unbelievable.
I used to be soda pop and soda alternation but I just kinda moved to only soda
I don't want to discredit him, but it's not hard to tell the taste apart from those three sources. Can tastes better than bottle. Fountain drink tastes better than all three. That's just how it's always been with every soda.
next food theory request are the 0 calorie drinks lying

Never done diet coke or others, and the fun thing when testet Coca Cola without sugar, it tastet the same as the original juhuuu

I thaught from the title that this wasa sad video
To this day I will refuse to drink store brand side because when I was like 5 I was drinking a Walmart brand soda (root beer to be exact ) then I took a sip from it and felt something with like a gummy and a spit it out and it ended up being a piece of flesh . So ya that is why I don't drink store brand soda .
no glass bottle coke?

Citric acid is Mr krabs secret ingredient
Haha, wow, I was drinking a BigK (Kroger) generic soda when I was watching this, because their generic stuff is great. It's also half the price of brand name.
Pepsi4Me
2:25 This has to be the most disturbing thing I have witnessed on this channel, especially without volume.
I've tried stevia sodas, but I've started liking probiotic soda (the right kind tastes Really good). If you ever find any, Olypop root beer and grape is good.
did you try and cleanse your pallet in-between matchups?
Drink Coke Zero
No you didn’t.
I’m soda
I'm p.o.p
Doubt this gets noticed but I have an interesting question. Mass distributors like Coke and Pepsi for example will often make a huge variety of flavors and containers. It's something you don't ever notice or see unless you work in the factory itself but not all flavors are marketed or distributed to all locales. For example, I have never heard of or seen Coke Life.  My question is this: How do videos like this, that advertise product variations, affect the marketing and consumer view of the company in whole. Does it elicit more curiosity in new products and open new markets or does it stir resentment in the company for having products I want to try but can't access.
How about drinking water or tea 🤷🏼‍♂️
läsk im swedich
I don't like diet coke cuz the after taste of it is disgusting
as a brit its just a can of product for example: can of Pepsi can of coke can of dr pepper
Regular coke
He's so addicted that he can tell where it came from
None of them.  Cold filtered water
that cola looking like that drip meme
To me diet coke tastes more salty than it does sweat...
I hate diet Coke and I HATE diet Pepsi but I love the theories channel! Another great video! Did I mention I HATE with a passion diet soda/pop/soda pop?
Food lion isn’t only in North Carolina
plz face reveal
This is weird to watch; my wife and I bought a house and moved to NC (from Florida) at the beginning of 2019 and had never shopped at Harris Teeter or Food Lion before, but we've found their branded products to be both amazing and reasonably priced; in fact, coming from Florida as we were I have wondered many times why the prices are so competitive given the dominance of Food Lions in the Charlotte area; many large chains in Florida are notorious for offering lower prices only long enough to drive out competition (looking at you, Wal Mart) and wouldn't even have a fraction of the coverage Food Lion does. I can seriously drive in any direction and hit one within 10 minutes.
Diet Coke has such a weird after-taste.  Coke Zero is far superior.
next foof theory: diet coke is a drug matpat: it is drug because it contains what causes you to buy an NFT me: wait... that just means that... thats it im unsubing
I dont what it is but I generally think Pepsi Zero is good AF. I got addict to it.
Hey i work at a pick n slave pog

You should've done this completely blind. Like, if you know a specific soda is in the matchup, that could have swayed your opinion mentally by "looking" for the soda you were expecting to drink

Did you know all the diet sodas are worse for you
Food lion and Harris Teeter may be using the same formula and bottler.
Regarding soda, if it isn't in glass, it isn't worth it.
Thankfully I live in VA soooo, Harris Teeter and Food Lion diet sodas here I come!

As a diet pepsi drinking the opening round was painful
For the one with SAMS diet cola and the Whole Foods diet cola, when they said that it one of them was really bad I knew it was Whole Foods lol
I personally like specifically McDonald's fountain coke best, then can.
Other. I call it soda pop
im a soft drink man idk, im australian i.e weird
try fanta
from the Philippines here, and we call them by their respective names most of the time but not always
Ayo I'm in North Carolina too!
Where I live Diet Coke actually has citric acid, so I wonder what Mathew would think
I can't believe for a channel like food theory. They only now realizing the power of citrus in cooking/food
the Other!!!  the pop soda that tastes coke.
Soda
I’m surprised his raspy voice for the catch phrase sounds the same in real time as it does in an edited video. He gotta be the commentator of a baseball match.
Me and my family say 'pop' I can't imagine saying soda or something else it just makes sense as pop like c'mon people
stop drinking any soda, then try zevia. its good then. but yeah u cant go from real soda to zevia.
I really wonder what about Diet Coke grabbed you so tightly… I don’t like it. Out of the Cokes, I prefer Coke Zero — milder flavor than regular Coke, which kinda burns, but no chemical aftertaste like Diet Coke. But my #1 is birch beer, #2 A&W diet root beer
For this taste test you were using the fountain version of Diet Coke - is this the version you would most regularly drink when at home? Were any of the other drinks from the fountain or were they all canned/plastic bottle? Cause if diet coke was the ONLY fountain drink and you normally drink, say, canned diet coke at home then this taste test might be kind of skewed in favor of diet coke.
D: frisdrank
I really know what you mean with the "dont be put of by the brand". i just inhale a very specific kind of no-name energy drink made by a rather fraund upon discount chain here i germany. i really do like the no-name better then the big brands we all know and love.
Hear in sweden we call it läsk
This was- this was intense
I just say soda pop...... is that bad?  Lol
for the 2nd matchup it was OBVIOUS that the bad one was Boylands since Matt said himself that Boylands have been using the same recipe as well as only bottling their colas since the 19th century or whatever which obviously was gonna show that their cola wouldn't taste nothing like modern day colas
Citric acid= lime juice.       Yeah it's good
I grew up on the east coast (US) and we called it soda in my (emphasis on my) family.
Sprite is obviously the best soda in the world.
Tea ...I'm a tea man...Bri'sh giberish
we call em fizzy drinks
My whole life i've called it pop. I'm from Kentucky which is southern and have never heard anyone say what kind of coke do you want. Never.
Steph and Matpat: *keep tying in rock paper scissors*  Me: Welp if that ain't a sign of them being perfect for eachother I don't know what is.
Iam c
Marianos does have big k diet coke, however regular diet coke still takes the cake for me- but big k does have a smoother flavor(kinda like semi flat diet coke) & i really like the after taste, but fountain diet coke just hits different
itss itts iiitsss just a theory right? right.? right...?
I am A
I *HATE* coke  When i was younger it tasted better but now Ewwwwwwww no disgusting I quit coke like 5 years ago 4 maybe?

I'm here to dispell the rumor.I've lived in North Carolina for almost all my life and NEVER have I been asked what kind of "Coke" I want at a restaurant. This is Pepsi country, LITERALLY the home of Pepsi lol. Coke is in a lot of restaurants but pepsi products are still more prominent. It's "soda" here, and Diet Mountain Dew sells like PS5's down here lmao It's literally never on store shelves more than a day

i don`t drink pop i am straight foward
us Canadians be like: haha Soda pop
You two doing videos is as sweet as sugar <3
not pop not soda not coke it's either mashke moogaz (carbonated drink in Hebrew) or cola (for coca cola)
Hi The Food Theorists, 🙏How are you? Loving it, 👌 look through my   just 👍 it, Many Thanks, Fiblee Support Team.  🤧
this was uploaded on my birthday 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
Yoooooo we had a Food Lion here in Pennsylvania literally like 20 minutes from my house out here in the middle of nowhere until it shut down a few years ago. I think there are more in PA but just none that I've seen where I live nor where I go to college.  Also, it's soda for me and almost everyone else here in PA, except like my grandfather and I think literally just him.
matpat is drinking all the soda
diet pop tastes so gross lol
This video happened because Diet Coke won’t sponsor MatPat.
I will call it Beverage  in Hebrew it's משקה mashke
coke
This is hilarious because my friend group genuinely enjoys big k brand more than name brand, and we often joke that it's better than the real thing. Turns out we were right! 😆
Pop is what i call it but i prefer water
Other theorists need to do this and then have the best go against the best
Bubba cola is pretty good
I don’t get how there is only one fountain soda how does this even make sense?
Soda
in england ive always just said the name of the drink (mainly just the big brands even if it was like a knock off) but i have seen people say pop
People who drink Diet Coke instead of water are really stupid
To be honest, I kinda hate the all or nothing mindset that American sodas have when it comes to sugar. I've had a lot of Asian sodas with only SOME sugar, that I've found more palatable than most super sugary corn syrup sodas.
Sweeteners are an acquired taste. If you drink nothing but stevia for a while, you get used to it. Just like you got used to aspartame.
anyone else seethe pizza planet truck in the beginning scene? or the avengers getting shawarma?

I actually switched to Pepsi products so the racist political campaign I did not agree with and same with my family so we’re not really drinking any Coke products root beer
I’m soda I don’t think it should be pop
Normal coke?
Other, fizzy
Not all Stevia tastes the same.    The stuff in Zevia (and Zevia soda in general) is awful.  Stevia-in-the-Raw (brand) tastes really good, 'cause it's exactly what it says: un-processed Stevia.  It works really well for tea and coffee. It's not stupidly sweet like Sweet n Low and Splenda, so you have to use a little more.  My newest go-to is the Splenda/Stevia half-and-half product.  As far as commercial soda/pop goes, I cannot have aspartame anymore (developed a bad allergy/sensitivity to it), and ones that use sucralose are few and far between around here, so... *shrug*
I don't call it soda or pop or coke.. here in the UK we call it just fizzy drinks..
d- sodie pop

""food lion"" comes form belgium, its called the "Delhaize" here but basicly the brand is based on the flemish lion which is like our mascot animal i suppose

one thing you failed to mention when come to so called diet soda is.... *ingredients on the cans, and bottles that comes on the soda something you failed to show!*
In Australia while you hear people call it Soda, A lot of times you will hear it called Soft Drink
Where i live coke is also short for cocaine
Im D:other, did anyone else called soda fizzy drink? I called it a fizzy drink  Btw i live in the north side

Holup, Harris Teeter is based in NC? I see it all the time everywhere in the East coast. Edit: food lion too? My whole life is a lie!
For the sources of diet coke, 1 (albeit uncommon) source of diet coke you missed is diet coke from glass bottles. Yes they're still around, I occasionally see them fleetingly at grocery stores.
I’ve always just called soda coke unless I was talking about a specific one, just grew up with that
I think the acidity can be gross for a while

Hi
me sitting here with a bottle of diet coke rn
here in brazil we just have one word for soda that is refrigerant (in rare cases some people call any soda coke but not as often used as refrigerant), and there is no diet/light coca cola just the no sugar version

I feel like you get pepsi max, me and DarkviperAV are two people I know who love pepsi max because diet pepsi is the worst but pepsi max has multiple flavours that have a nice taste but you can easily switch between two (cherry and normal are my favourites) but it is also a drink that you can mix and still have it not taste bad, yes I mixed pepsi max with other flavours (all of them) and it tasted great, I don't even like most of the stuff that the flavours are made from yet the mix just worked.
Apparently they also taste different depending on location too. It has something to do with the water used in bottling/canning/mixing in the fountain machine.

B: soda
I gave up diet coke, diet in general, years back. It was actually painful cause of the ingredients in it. Very painful. Many of my muscles were cramping up from it. So glad I stopped drinking it. I drink regular or natural now.
In Las Vegas I hear soda, But i just say Diet like "I'll take a large Diet or a Diet please"
I just love that you seeded the brands... HAHA
i use "fizzy drink"
B SODA
Refresco solos all your CokPopSoda asses
me sitting in my bed looking over at my 7 cans of diet coke on my night stand
I’m in Australia so for me it’s fizzy
in england we just call them fizzy drinks
Try mr. Pib
Diet cola sales dropped by 500% because of you
9:23 you've never seen a taste like this
For me its not pop soda or coke instead ,,gazirani sokovi” its in serbian and translate will be like  mineral juice that can be said for fanta coca cola pepsi seven up sprite... u should visit serbia is really pretty country.
I'm fizzy beverage
I legit want to see a round of the food lion vs diet coke and coke zero. Also diet cola is evil. But I understand food addiction to things that ain't the best for you.
20:20 - She’s right. You just can’t top, Coke Zero.  Matthew on the other hand… I felt he had bias, in that, much like a movie, a twist at the end, makes the movie more interesting.  All that being said… I enjoyed the comparisons. Thank you for doing it.
1:34 I have gained 85 pounds all because I skipped the begging of the video wtf
@Matpat please do a food theory on which diet soda is the most healthiest or something similar to the idea, please.
We grew up with soda as a group of sodas, and mostly refer to singular or small groups by individual name. Ex - They only have soda here. I’d like a Sprite, and he’d like a Root Beet.
My parents always say pop so I just adopted saying pop. I haven’t actually heard someone say coke unless it was coca cola
Here (in our language) we call it "noshabeh" which if you translate it altogether it does mean soda but fun fact is when you break the word and translate it piece by piece: "noshabe" is a mix of "nosh" and "Abeh". "Nosh" is short for "noshidan" which when translated means "Drinking" and "abeh" or rather say "ab" translates to "water" so in fact, we call our sodas "a water to drink"!!!
I wish I could get shasta cola bottles in nz
I'm on Team Soda (B)! As someone who's grown up in California, it's weird to hear online friends from Texas say Coke.
Pepsi zero sugar? You people dont call it pepsi max
I call it soda, but I was firmly pop raised
Before he even said it, once he started talking about March Madness, I knew he'd reference Duke. #GoTerps

This is legit just the Euro 1990. Denmark who wasn't even supposed to make it from the bracket, moves on to the quarters because of their second place spot in their bracket, when number one goes to war. Then, they win the entire championship.
I call it coke
I don't live in the usa, so Harris Teeter is of the table, and I LOVE coke zero, and I don't like diet, so I won't be changing my cola of choice.
#GameTheorySquad
In hungary, we have this store chain Coop ABC (Kóópé ÁBÉCÉ) who sells their own branded cola. It's soo good we always buy theirs and always have prefered theirs over the big brands. And they are not just tastier, but even way more cheaper! Who would have tought....
Pop
Don't drink Diet Pepsi
In Arizona, we call all sodas Sierra Mist.
Soda
I grew up in the Midwest and called the sugary water beverage "pop".  However, maybe because I've moved around the country I use the term "soda" more frequently now.  Coke was supposedly something the California people called the drink, but I didn't find it was used everywhere with more often "soda" popping up (pun intended). 😀.   I didn't like the taste of most of the diet drinks so I stuck to the regular flavors.  When I realized how much of this stuff with fructose ingredient was helping me pack on the pounds, I cut back to almost nothing now.  A serious drop in calorie intake has help me drop weight as well.
I’m drinking a coke zero
Caffeine free diet coke is the best, i was surprised you didn’t have it in the challenge.
You can be a 10/10 but this man has the ability to differentiate between a can and bottle

I live in the Midwest, but my family, or at least me, calls it Coke. Although, I was born in Oklahoma, so I might be a bit biased
Here in Ireland we call it mineral drink
i can vouch for the original boylan coke, it is WAY better
This is why I add lemon juice to anything I make, sweet or savory.

I don’t drink diet soda i just chug a gallon Milo’s sweet tea, or drink about 30oz. Of Dr.Pepper.
My dad is like MatPat put with diet mt dew
RIP Diet Coke jokes
it’s coke
Turns out consumerism has conditioned us to hate savory, high quality flavor
Coke Zero 100% has the best flavor of cola products
id love to try different colas but i work for coca-cola so i get so many free cases of drinks lol
I’m a c
wait which is number 7
I'm from Texas and I call it Soda.
zero fruitie is underdog
As an Australian, it's soft drink.
Yep none of those stores are near me the closest I have to store brand is acme signature select which taste just like those gummy cola candies the shape of the bottles I think Haribo makes them
zevias are awesome, my family drinks them by the gallon. also, fun fact, stevia is 300 times sweeter than sugar lol
18:18 shouldn't Mat just been the deciding vote? (Mirror, not Pat)
We have Food lion here in tennessee too!! whoop whoop!
As a Canadian, pop
I don't have any Kroger owned stores where I live, but I'm going to experiment with adding citric acid and see if it improves the flavor of my local diet cola.
I am a Cola
I grew up in Georgia and remember drinking the diet cola from Food Lion. I think the one I used to go to for groceries got torn down though..
I now wanna try harris teeter diet cola now-
In Scotland everything is juice, we name brands but even water is called council juice 😂
Here in the Philippines we call it Soft Drinks. 🥤
You're not the real MatPat
Diet Coke sucks. Pepsi Max rules (because Diet Pepsi also sucks, as does Coke Zero).
I don’t call it coke, pop or soda I call it soft drink
Undrafted free agent becomes rookie of the year
Did you know that Coca-Cola had cocaine in it original
In the south, everyone says Coke. But in recent years I’ve been saying either soda or soft drink.
Cold Drink
As a person born and raised in North carolina I'm proud of the performance of the north carolina brands
All diet soda is bad for you. Drink regular, real sugar, or none. It makes your body unable to process normal sugar and become diabetic. Yes diet soda, made for diabetics, causes diabetes more than normal soda. And it tastes terrible. Just drink real juice or tea, not the high sugar artificial crap.
Okay so, drink normal coke instead of diet coke. Problem solved.
Come
I call it soda, but here in the south most people do call it coke and it makes me sad.
I say "soda pop" both together one alone sounds weird, buuut i do sometimes shorten it down to one so idk
Try celery soda!!!!!!!
I've gotta say, i was surprised to hear that Food Lion was more local than I thought. I will definitely try Kroger cola next time I go.
I’m glad you quit that stuff it’s really dangerous living that live good luck getting back on track mat!
Try Pepsi max
What about pepsi maximum taste no sugar ?
Diet lemon cola is awesome tbh.
Do cherry sodas next
D. Cool Drinks
Good job matpat for giving up Diet Coke
1:12
Guess this one Inumin
I Mean, Stevia is my regular sweetener, I understand its very sweet. But I like sweet stuff
I was eating a chicken burger that recently came out in jollibee. It was very tasty. Makes me want to do a tournament for the chicken burger i will eat for the rest of the year. It was last year and my favorite there was chicken burger that came out recently in jollibee.
First
In my state we call soda  Root beer
15:32 here we call it in spanish "refresco" or "gaseosa" but idk im not a carbonated drink fan xd so i rarely say soda or coke or pop. Just water or tea :D .
Ok, i dont know if anyone else does this but ive been doing this since I was a kid back in Mississippi, i say Fizz. Like "Can I have some Cola Fizz?" Strawberry Fizz, Orange Fizz, Lemon Fizz, that kind of thing.
I am coke
I call it Coke
22:34 and what? 😳
SODA
TIL Food Lion is NC based. Ive lived here my whole life and just assumed they were everywhere across the country.
Give hi. Props he does all this research for us
In my town in england we are near a morrisons and there 17p coke or 23 cent in the US and its sooo good
Fizzy

Who are you and what have you done to Matpat?
Meh i prefer sprite or rootbeer
I’m from minasota so pop
Pepsi max
Here in the Philippines its Softdrinks
Food lione is olso in romania
pepsi zero sugar (in my opinion) tastes the same when it's flat
For me we call it either coke or soda. Also yall should try jaritos
i have lived in nc all my life and we know how to soda just try cheerwine its heaven
listen if somebody asks me what kinda 'coke' i want, and i say 'coke cherry' and they respond with "we only have pepsi products" im gonna look at em funny because 'coke' will always mean the brand in my mind. If they say 'Soda', 'Pop', or 'Cola' then we have an understanding, lol
Lol in Australia I've always called it soft drinks, or fizzy drinks
A
No Matt it’s food kitty
I live in NC as well, so…lol.
d; soft drink
Hey Mat and the lovely Steph (no disrespect), can you and your team do something on the "Zero" sugar colas? Preferably "Zero" Dr Pepper & Cream. I've done good withdrawing myself from Mt Dew sub products but still have a soft spot for Baja Blast; not zero though (thanks for trying). I get the major difference from plastic to aluminum (rulez!) drinks (don't want to buy a combo meal or 2$ for a craving for fountain). Since summer time, I've been consuming a lot of Dr Pepper & Cream Zero even driving around when my two main grocery stores don't have them.   Sooo please please with Diet Coke flavored ice cream in your own special way ruin Dr Pepper & Cream Zero for me, or are the commercials right? Sorry if the lady had to go remote to avoid a social media stalker to give the world the amazing tastes of Zero Dr Pepper. I know this video you avoided Dr. Pepper to prove a point, buuuut you broke your own rules for the best Spiderman... admit it Mat! Your rules was based on pretty much generic ability, but you gave Tom Holland a major pass with his suits ability that came from Stark. He wasn't aware of the numerous combos available the computer told him, but yet you still counted against Tobey Maguire. So rather late to demand a recount I still luv you.  Back to the subject, is Zero Dr Pepper, coke or anything else truly minus all sugar and good for our health? Or is it loaded with "Splenda" type sweeteners that for some can really mess with your memory and/ or awareness? So there's your challenge Mat & Co. Still mid Jan 2022, can you ruin or make this New Year's resolution for "Zero" products?   Also besides merch how can I contribute/ donate to your channel? Luv your tedious research on Film Theory and Food Theory (sorry, luv video games but not a gamer) I know this question is in great hands.
Coke profit after losing matpat as a customer: -$100 000 000 000 000 000x00
From NC here, never heard anyone in my entire life refer to all sodas as coke. Not once.
POV: You Say  soft drinks
Darnit!  In Publix-dominated Florida, we don't have any of those chains.  At least not where I am. :(
Wait, why would you even have fountain diet coke as an option? You can’t really buy that in bulk! wtf?
Nc repesent
D, I call it soft drink.

Excuse you as a South Carolinian I have in fact heard of and been to a food lion
Coca Cola: Quick! We need to buy that recipe and lock it up somewhere!
Soda
Me in india who can't relate
In Canada we say pop and soda but hhhhoooo says coke for frickin mountain dew
Has anyone else actually had Harris Teeter cola?
I call my soda fizzy to annoy my family that calls it coke
Fun fact: Food Lion is actually the Belgian supermarket ‘Delhaize’ renamed because it would be easier to pronounce in the US
But... why diet?
D can
soda
In my country we call coca cola,Pepsi etc.we call them sodapop
Choosing Fountain Diet Coke Is so unfair aren’t fountain soda made sweeter so they can add ice without watering it down as much?
He's like Markiplier but much nicer Because Markiplier quit Takis after they didn't sponsor him  Just like he did with a bunch of other nameless brands  Sour Patch Kids del Monte the list goes on and on
Looking at all the cola even makes me feel kinda sick But when they are just single it’s ok And I wanted Harris teeter to win
The thing is all of these r bad and worse then just normal  cola or whatever lol not something to drink if you want to be healthy
The biggest betrayal of the history of the world
POP
Try Cheerwine! Best (cherry) cola by far!
Kroger according to Good Mythical Morning has made a lot of off brand bangers. Seems their food processing centers do a great job at making good tasting products.
@Hot ones
No, it's Soda in the Midwest, not pop
A
Limsa
Pop because I'm a Michigander. 😏
I heard that any kind of Diet Pop (Soda) is actually worse for your health than regular Pop (Soda.)
wow after so many years! Just goes to show, you gotta try new things!
always heard ‘soda’ growing up in PA, would hear ‘pop’ over in OH when i’d visit. interestingly, i came across a few diners/etc between my destination and home that name the beverage the full ‘soda pop’. just funny and makes me wonder how many other neighboring states have those slight cultural differences, even if they’re that close.
pop
15:30 where I live d because we go into the place whatever and say hey can I have [Insert brand name/type of sofa here]
POP!!
Unpopular opinion: root beer tastes like a grinded  up tootsie roll that’s been soaking in coke
I had a friend who died of bone cancer in his early 20s, he loved Diet Coke. He preferred it because of the taste, he wasn't trying to stay fit. Dude had his left leg amputated in his late teens, but it still kept spreading. Idk if artificial sweeteners were related to his cancer, but I've avoided them since.
A
in england theyre labled as fizzy/soft drinks but we say the name of the drink were talking about
[SPOILERS AHEAD] i was rooting for harris teeter i mean, he was just like meant to be a backround character and ended becoming the main character, the most suprising thing is that it was meant to be another diet coke i will now explain this wonderful anime So, MatPat, (the side character obviously) is seeing which diet cola is the best after he took a break from diet cola He decides to make a list featuring 16 colas, 3 Diet cokes, Bottle, can and fountain, coke zero, diet pepsi, pepsi no caffeine, others, diet coke Splenda. He goes to purchase all of these but cannot find diet coke splenda so he just buys Harris Teeter instead because it was in the store. He does several intense matches where the cokes are put up in a fight against who tastes the best, The matches are 1: Diet coke and Publix, with diet coke coming out on top. 2nd match: Boylan vs Sodastream, it's an intense fight but shockingly, sodastream wins after an intense battle. 3rd battle, Diet Pepsi vs. Zevia, it's not an intense fight and diet pepsi EASILY takes the win. 4th match, Diet Rite vs. Pepsi Zero Sugar, Pepsi Zero Sugar wins the battle. 5th battle is Diet Shasta vs. Coke Zero, Coke Zero obviously taking the W,  now the 8th battle is an interesting one featuring the utter noob 365 Zero Calorie cola and diet Sams Cola, Very unsuprisingly Diet Sams Cola takes the win.  Now we enter the quarter finals, first round is really suprising with a really interesting story, Harris Teeter fights against Johnnie ryan, and with alot of shocking twists and turns Harris Teeter takes the trophy. Now food lion fights vs. Diet Pepsi, extremely suprisingly Food Lion beats the big and strong Diet Pepsi. Now we move on to the semi-finals (yes i skipped the first part because i am an idiot and it would make the comment wayyyy to long) Coke Zero destroyed Diet Sams Cola with a single full power taste blast, Diet Coke pinched soda stream and won the battle EASILY. Now, we have 2 family members fighting eachother, Pepsi Zero and Pepsi Caffeine free, Pepsi Caffeine free barely takes the win being very scarred after the battle but quickly healed by medics, Now. 2 Californians fight eachother and the Californians are Harris Teeter and Food Lion, both have the same amount of skill but Haris Teeters IQ plays gave him the win. After that intense battle we have Diet coke vs Diet Pepsi Caffeine Free. Diet coke (the previous winner) wins again! Now Harris Teeter and Coke Zero fight intensley, but they end up in a tie because they managed to satisfy MatPat and a new character Stephanie alot, so they both proceed to the next round. Now it is the final round.... The Championship. Coca Cola zero and Diet cola fight, with Coca Cola Zero defeating Diet Cola but being scarred. Now Harris Teeter was very smart and waited for one of them to fall in battle so they could have an advantage vs the one who won, It was a tough fight but Harris Teeter manages to win. He now has the trophy of Coke wars and is respected by MatPat, that's the entire anime, it was really good i rated it a 10/10
:D
i say either just coke or if i'm not having coca cola i say either fizzy drink or soft drink
Sodavand
I live in Australia and we call soda, soft drink. Idk if anyone else calls it this

I never thought a diet cola tasting video would make me proud of being a North Carolinian

i love how happy matt is to drink diet coke
Yo the new coke zero is pog
I have never had a coke that taste as good as the original apart from Pepsi gets very close but the aftertaste on all the sugar free ones is disgusting to me.
I’m a carbonated beverage person
moral of the story, buy cheaper heroin
the universe spoke
What about rc cola? I don’t know if they have a diet version but rc is a relatively large brand compared to other lesser known sodas
I'm C. Coke
The only soda worse than Coke is Diet Coke. You can only go up from there.  Serious question though. Why diet anyting. Just drink water
Ahhhh Food Lion, a classic.
Coke Zero!!!😡
huh this video was uploded a day later of my birhtday lol
can we all agree saying coke for every carbonated drink is weird personally i like pop rolls of the tongue
have y’all tried diet sundrop
the only "Soda" (we dont call them soda in Australia) i drink (actually pre much the only thing i drink) is Pepsi Max so i can't recommend anything else. i tend to call it fizzy cordial (seeing as it is basically just carbonated cordial), just fizzy drinks or by brand name
Who else likes watching food theory eating breakfast
F diet sodas - I need that sugar.
pop POP pop POP pop POP
Fun fact : HE still drinks Diet coke
im a normal B boi
i call it vodka
“Food lion, which you probably never heard of”  Pathetic food lion is our go to grocery store [for my family] here in Delaware
Here in Australia we call it soft drink
Hey, MatPat, I know this comment is kind of late, but I have a question about a specific fizzy drink that exists mainly in the USA.  I am from Bulgaria and I hate Coca-Cola's taste and from what I understand from my experience and other people's travels is that Coke doesn't taste the same everywhere ( i. e Turkey's coke is suuuper sweet and that's how they like it), Bulgaria's coke is absolute trash for me because I hate the sweet after-taste. I was in the US a few years ago and I tried Dr Pepper for the first time ever and it was amazing to say the least. I am not sure if that is considered  "a coke-like drink" but I can 100% say that for me it's better than any other fizzy drink I have ever tasted. Can you do an episode on it or maybe reply to my comment, pls? :D Thank you for the great content, stay blessed!
It's so funny that a video on his favorite most ranted about soda is also one of his longest videos
I say fizzydrink
he only wished that he had Dominican no calories coke
Harris Teeter literally went through a Rocky story, upset and all

How about Dr.Pepper
did you guys buy an entire fountain soda machine for the fountain diet coke???(or  were you going to if harris teeter didn't win)
I'm a pop man
That's true, different source, different taste
I was sad when diet Sam's cola got out because my dad always buys it so I drink it basically every day. But I was very happy when I saw it was in the competition.      I was also drinking diet Sam's cola while I watched this lol 🤣😅
I live near a Publix in the same state!

My favorite soda is water jk its pepsi
All but coke
I thought I loved Cheerwine, but I don't think I could pull off what Mat did in the first few seconds of this episode. The fact he could simply LOOK at each glass and tell EXACTLY what source the Diet Coke came from is nothing short of impressive and frightening. You and Steph really weren't kidding with just how much you love Diet Coke. Been a fan for a long time of yours and didn't realize the habit was this bad... Diet Coke rehab, anyone?  EDIT: Anyone who ever goes through NC, you gotta try our Food Lion items. As Mat stated during the FL vs Pepsi round, Food Lion is very much a NC thing and nearly EVERYTHING they have is AWESOME.
Only pepsy
Coke
A. all the way MN represent
the reason the cola in the soda stream round was so strong because it was made with to much solution
my mom has been drinking diet coke since before i was born, (she's 60) and i think her and MatPat  could actually give the diet cola stock market a run for it's money! i would love to see her and mat do a challenge >:) also i love ur vids Mat, Steph and the entire team of theorists! i love game, film and food theory so much and they are a great time killer and amazing entertainment source! (also Steph is very pretty and i feel like people don't appreciate how gorgeous she is!) <33
maybe "poseidon powder" isn't msg but it's citric acid
In Australia we call it 'Fizzy' :)
POP FOREVER
We need some sort of sequel to this
in Johannesburg south africa we normally say cold drinks
Jones cola

i ask what soft drinks they offer then choose.

The best coke if the glassbottle one. Then the can then the 2l bottles then the 0.5l bottles. I really like vanilla coke though too to change it up
Considering what we’ve seen on GTLive we know this is a lie
we dont call everything coke in the south..
i just beat my brohair in the no drink challengwew!!
I love the no drink challenge!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Being from the west coast, raised half way up north, and now married to a southerner and now live in the south, I can say I am fluent in the language of sodas. Though I was super thrown off when I was first asked "if I want a coke" and then being handed...ya know...not an actual coke lol.
soda pop
I am not coke, pop, or soda. I'm a strong weed type
From my experience, and I love Coke, the Kroger brand of Coke just tastes better. I do not know what it is, but it just tastes so much better. And when I first tried it, I did not even mean to get it. I was just rushing and grabbed a bottle of Kroger brand Coke, since it was right there. Then when I tried it, I was amazed at how good it tastes. Plus, it is so much cheap to get the store brand then the name brand.
In texas we call it soda
Here in Texas we drink dr.pepper and sweet tea
Has anyone drunk Sam's cola
b >:D
Pop
I won't drink a lot of diet coke but I will consume a lot of regular coke
I don’t believe him with that statement
Jeez way to be over dramatic at the end there, over some soda. I thought I almost saw a tear run down your face over the fact that another diet soda tastes good. It's not like the ingredients are pretty much the same or anything. It's a miracle that you ever found a different diet cola.
Mat….
But I thought it was tenth 18:02
S O D A S O D A S O D A S O D A S O D A S O D A S O D A S O D A
If I'm talking local and colloquial, I say Pop, but if I need to be universally unambiguous, I say soft drink or name the drink specifically.
England: all just coke
CANAIDIAN POP ALL THE WAY
I’m in Nashville, and most call it Coke, but my family splits evenly between Soda (sane) and Pop (northern transplants/ insane people)
That's weird; I live in Virginia, and there are both Kroger _and_ Harris Teeter around here.
Other: Carbonated Beverage, Go Rochester
I just looked is my fridge and saw Coke Zero sugar
Diet mnt.dew!
Next do a cherry flavor tourney
Soft drink 😅 but when I talk to my Italian grandma its 7up for everything lmao
Now he is going to try get a sponsorship with Harris teeter like he did with diet coke
I’m easily pop
Is it me that call soda/pop/etc, fizzy drink?
I’m from Ohio, it’s Pop
15:33 im other we call it fizzy drink
She’s wrong. It’s not all coke in the south. Cola, not coke.
Fountain sodas are always the best, not just diet sodas
Moral of the story Citric acid just makes everything better
We call it either soda (the name of the brand so sprite for example) Or Soft drink  :D

Friends don't let friends drink diet coke...

Pepsi Max will always be the best cola. Coke is more of a mixer.
You can’t drink zevia after eating something sweat or something with artificial sweaters. It toataly ruins the flavor! It gets a bad aftertaste. Zevia is great if your on a low sugar/carb diet.

If you like diet coke your taste is battery acid not normal good food

In Germany everyone just calls it Cola. whatever brand

"The world has ever tasted" hmm? Im from germany. there is no store like that in my country xD
My husband is the same way with Dr Pepper. It still amazes me that he can look at a plain glass filled with Dr Pepper right next to a glass of Coke and, just by looking at them, can tell me which is which.
D. Other. Its sippity pippity bubbly wubbly. Period. Hands down
Soda
Matpat: Soda, pop, coke or other me, a brit, who calls pepsi coke bc i hate pepsi, but calles everything else a "fizzy drink": ...

If the citric acid makes the drinks taste especially good, maybe should experiment with adding some good lemon juice to it. Not the dreaded stuff my mother always bought (RealLemon?) from the grocery store, but either from a real lemon or a good brand of organically grown lemon juice like Lakewood or Volcano. The difference between such good brands (no preservatives, lots of serious taste) and the cr*p mom always got is amazing.   The good stuff (just juice from organically grown lemons, nothing else) is not that expensive either. I get 16oz bottles of Lakewood from Kroger’s or by mail order. The taste is good for at least 6 weeks after opening (refrigerate). It’s much cheaper than lemons in my area.
My dad use to work at foodlion
Citric Acid and MSG are key.

I think it's kind of funny, I honestly don't like diet sodas OR coke, pepsi, or Dr pepper. I honestly think they're gross (I'm not slamming you people that do like them that's just my opinion) my favorite sodas are root beer, ginger ale, and sprite.
You want me to do something for you in return for a favour I never asked for? No thanks, you decided to ingest an irresponsibly sized amount of health deterrent. Live with it, take care 😁
We in finland 🇫🇮 call soda limu

Shasta Cola is often found in 2.5 L Bottles at Dollar Tree. Shasta is a very sweet cola. I prefer Faygo Moon Mist or Faygo Lemon Lime.
How do you do these and leave out RC Cola, the king of North Carolina sodas?!?!? Also I’m from Atlanta, Ga, so it’s Coke. You’re not even allowed to like Pepsi in this town
I call them fizzy drinks
Soft drink is what everyone I know calls it, prolly an australian thing. Don't even know why we call it that
You gotta think that he not always getting fountain Diet Coke tho. Would’ve beat can easy haha
I just niticed this video was posted on my birth day
You are super handsome

You really have to rename this title as it’s false advertising. You seem to be drinking Diet Coke still.
Food lions are based in both carolinas
Found Kroger's Big K Citrus Drop while budget shopping. I've been introducing it as 'Mountain Dew, but good' since.  Coming from a similar obsession with the brand as Mat with Dcoke.  (Similar like, one year my dad's big christmas present was a 4'x4'x4' box filled with mountain dew cans, and with three of us drinking it because he shared, it was gone in a week. Not our proudest year.)
Soda
I’m a pop and a soda kind of guy
I was shocked by how good Kroger brand coffee is. I got some dark roast stuff, it was really good.😃
Me + Minnesota = Pop
glass bottle coke is by far  the best source and the fact that it wasn't included kinds hurts
We had Food Lion in Oklahoma but they shut down in the 90s. Didn't known they were still around.  And the whole "What kind of coke do you want?" is 100% a thing here, and it drives me nuts.
A
you should try senkus cola recipe.
I just drink spindrift it’s a pretty good replacement for soda and it’s super low in calories, but there’s really only a few good flavors.
i wish that I could eat and drink this way and still keep a trim waistline. this man either won the genetic lottery or works out like a maniac.
Red cola would have been a good contestent
i always call it “Soda” it just makes sense
were coke up in the south.
Not just north Carolina Tennessee too
Food lion is not a north carolina brand I go to it to get my food there and im in delaware
Food 4 Less don't have it, it doesn't carry store brand stuff.
MatPat would definitely love the vending machines at my school bc they only have diet and zero versions of soda.
Pop matpat invite Brent tv to be on the channel
I’m a big Coke Zero guy. I like Coke Zero because I think regular Coke is a little too sweet for me (although glass bottled coke is really good). I thought it was in my head, but I was surprised to see that you actually think Coke Zero is less sweet than other sodas. Don’t get me wrong, I love sweets, but you can have too much of a good thing. I am a little disappointed that you gave Coke Zero 3rd place tho
And now I'm disappointed. I'm exactly one state south of Matt Pat and a bit further west than he is and I can't get Kroger branded diet soda to test out. I'll have to go see if any of my local stores have a diet Cola made with citric acid
I’m a pop guy
sadly i think in miami i don't have any of those stores
i call it fizzy for some reason
shouldn't be drinking it at all :/
NeXT time that you do a rasten test Rey getting your hands on done Julmust or påskmust. Erich is a cola based drink mainly consumed in Sweden during Xmas and Easter.  Must has a good reputation of out selling and lowering the Coca-Cola selling percentage with more then 50% during Christmas and is an over all loved drink in Sweden. It might not be the best cola maybe we Swedes are just crazy but I wouldn’t appreciate it if you could try to use it in your next video on the subject. -Love you btw   Pls like so Dad-pat see’s this<3
NOW I KNOW WHY                                                                             If you see this……. I don’t know why

Food lion isn't a grocery store that came from the US, it's an American variant of the Belgian supermarket Delhaize, something that existed way before Food lion, as you can see when you look them up, same logo and everything.
you forgot thumps up
Don't worry matpat thank the watchmojo  Cause the watch mojo bring's you to me
Fountain sodas go flat faster not sure why you would use that as the control.
If U asked me U should of just bought fanta
You better try Dr. pepper

Florida is not characterized as the south east.
The diet cokes taste different because of the bottle/can? Fam, it's eating the bottle and metal away! :P

Im gonna go ahead and say that you should only drink diet soda if you like the taste if it. Diet soda's are actually significantly worse for you than regular soda eapecially if your trying tonloose weight
15:19 i grew up calling it like literally just plainly 'cans' whether it was in a bottle or can
"What kind of Coke do you want?" "I'll have a Coke" "Sorry we only have Pepsi products" [heavy sigh] *Flips table*

Kroger has the best private label sodas. All of them are better than a comparable major brand.
Coke
with boylans theirs goes back to when the purpose of colas were pharmacy products.
diet dr pepper, diet mt dew, and coke zero are the top 3 easy. full flavor with virtually no aftertaste. something diet coke cannot boast. good job steph
I tried HT's diet cola and wasn't impressed but I'll have to try the zero calorie version. I love Teeter's so much!

We keep our drinks outside  It gets a reasonable cold tempature down here  but I don't really say soda, coke, or pop  I just put my hand on the front door and ask if i can have one  Or I'll just say  'I'm going to get a drink' and take one without asking
Pepsi no sugar at least in Australia is called Pepsi max
Calling all soda coke is definatly chaotic evil

Boylan is so good. Their other drinks are probably way better. I never had their diet.
I grew up with one parent loving Pepsi and hating Come and one parent loving Cole and hating Pepsi. I really didn't have a preference, but I have found that Pepsi is sweeter and Coke has more flavor. I'm wondering if anybody else can confirm?

Seeing how many things change from citric acid, heres a theory. Are all foods improved by Citric Acid? And if they arent, What foods can be better by adding it, even if they are not in the market at the time?

Food Lion used to be around, but famously went all but entirely bankrupt. That it still exists in a single place at all is just futile.
i dont get it just drink regular coke or pepsi!
When you’re British: 🥲
I'm a little late on this, but I was surprised that no one really said this as I was scrolling down in the comments. But in my family, everybody just calls it a cold drink. Like any fizzy drink, is called a cold drink. no one really calls it pop, maybe cola. Or if you really want to be specific here in Canada we have this Ginger Ale called Canada dry.
i grew up with calling soda's "cool drinks" and i still call it that

I'm not American but where I live everyone(not only my family, literally everyone) here calls a soda, a coke or if its a different flavour, you call it by the colour of the drink. For example we have a raspberry red drink and a green creamsoda drink. You'll call the raspberry the red cold drink and the creamsoda the green cold drink.
In New Zealand we call it fizz lol
D. Soft drink :)
Im only drink coca cola for once :')

Random question but does anybody remember when Pepsi Zero was actually Pepsi Max?
In Australia we typically say 'soft drink' or 'soda.' But you can say any of the other variants and we'll know what you're talking about.
I'm a Coke Zero gal. Diet Coke has always tasted like cheap off-brand Coke. :/

Kroger brand is the only “generic” brand I’ll drink!
Not coca-cola tho
I can't stand artificial sweeteners and I don't like high-fructose corn syrup either. Its either sugar or stevia for me when it comes to sodas.

I have never called it anything other than fizzy drink
can u do this for regular soda i hate aspartame
The area in the Midwest I'm from must be such an Outlier. I have only known one person to refer to Soda Colloquially as "Pop". Everyone else I know that grew up around here refers to it as Coke or Soda.

Boylan root beer has a distinct licorice taste to me. Have fun with that people that happen to hate both of those.
I spent years drinking coke then went off it for a while. Found the private label brand cola from my local Coles supermarket here in Australia and I like it more than coke. I bought it because it's cheap and yeah, it's got that more interesting flavour. It's 90c compared to $2 for the equivalent sized coke product. Also, I call them soft drinks.
coke
I am from the south and for me I am pop person and somethings soda but in recusants they do not say that type of coke do you want they say what type of cola do you want.
I I’m pop
I know that its not available at ur place but fritz kola is just godly
I call it soda I don’t understand why you would call every soda coke like root beer isn’t coke
Soda....No. Pop.....No. It's a Soder.

The artificial sweetener in diet coke is carcinogenic. I can't believe you put that into your body. you should be way smarter than that.

BRUH "Diet Rite" sounds a lot more like Diorite to me. lol
You should drink diet pepsi tastes so much better Shasta or C&C.   diet ginger ale that is better than sodas altogether Sweeps Seagrams Diet birch beer soda is great clear is best the faces they make with ones that taste like cough medicine is priceless I want to try Zevia
Hey food there try kombucha cola flavored it taste just like pop and really healthy

ZEVIA IS DISGUSTING
Diet Coke? I think i can't watch you any more. I will be reporting all your videos from now on
HEB cola, a southern grocery store cola, is likely the best cola available.
Try water, it's delicious
I didn't know amaricans had delhaize supermarkets.
Cans have more fizz and always will
Pepsi 0 is best

In Australia, it's called Soft Drink.
Shoulda just had the cameraman keep track of the bracket and not tell you what the match ups were so there was absolutely no possible biases. Then just have a complete suprise at the end.
Ok
I'd rather stalk Steph.
One of the kids in my math class called matpat Matthew Patthew
The fact that they kept on tying, the universe says that they belong together
Cola is pretty dominating in my country so all sodas is either just called cola or soda, so I can ask for cola and they might ask if I want sprite, Fanta or some other soda instead of asking me what flavour cola I want lol  Oh and as a general add on, did you know companies can loose the right to their brand name if it commonly replaces the name of what the brand is, ie if everyone calls a car a Ford, Ford would lose its right to have the name Ford copyrighted
Cream soda and semi flat cherry Pepsi are the best soda
I Call it “Sodavand” (sodawater) translated from danish to engslish. Yes im from denmark
I know What food lion is I used to live in North carolina for like 5 years
nc rep
Idk why but in danish soda is called sodavand which is directly translated to sodawater.
mat pat quit coke im so proud of him
generally like matpat but, he really shouldnt make such dubious claims about aspartame's 'worrying' health status. Many, many, *many* scientific studies have been done by a wide range of organizations and all basically universaly agree that there arent negative health effects to the average person (meaning, people without niche medical conditions)
I am addicted to Pepsi, HELP!
You two are simply awesome!
me just sittin here in australia sayin 'Soft drink'   15:25
what i noticed is when mat is standing up he looks alot taller.. HA exposed
Oh its the same as kroger. Their store brand of coke is actually my favorite!  We prefer it over regular coke
Lucazade is the best drink ever

I never really drunk diet coke maybe a couple times but I do not like diet coke although my grandmother who was diabetic loved it she drank 6 cans a day I do like coke zero though
Does the bro know water exists?
I got some tonic from New England, not how I say it but what older New Englanders that I know do.
How dare you assume I never heard of food lion😤 here in Virginia we used to have it
3:46 are my ears failing me, can someone tell me what I just heard??!?!?!
; (
Zero coke is good
I'm definitely a "soda" guy
Other- in England it’s a fizzy drink
Diet soda taste like dirt
Well this was a complete lie
I think food lion makes the best generic products imo or I just grew up poor 😅😂
Food lion is not just a NC brand. I know this is random to say but it’s in both NC and I honestly feel like Virginia gets left out of everything on YouTube. Idk y I am commenting this I just felt like saying it because Virginia needs to be more recognized. VIRGINA DOESNT EVEN HAVE A BIG BIG SPORTS TEAM. I MEAN COME ON 😥
other: i call it a fizzy drink
BRO THAT ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME WHAAAAT!!?
How is fountain diet cola better? isn't it diluted with water?
where i'm from we call soda brus, and that's because englsh is not our national language
Well I call Coke zero Coca-Cola zero sugar
I’ve actually seen a food lion in Virginia near where I live, and I remember nothing about it
Lol, error in the video:  Food Lion is ... based ... well, it's a belgian brand ... Food lion is what we call "delhaize" (family name from the ones who started the supermarket chain).  We also have the same lion as a logo... but hey, that very good cola you drank, it's a recipe from Belgium!
I’m glad he’s quitting Diet Coke, because…well let’s face it, diet sodas are often WORSE than the original…
i say läsk
Happy halloween, matpat!

As a viewer from nc, I need to stop by Harris teeter
I think he forgot to remove the Food theory: so HE NEVER QUIT
I like sams cola, just not the diet type. And I'm a strong C
soda
We’re other/cold drink  Yes I know calling soda cold drink is weird but it is what it is
Sad, I really expected a better control out of you, you are discussing opinions before trying both options and you're not using pallet cleansers.... really disappointed, you normally do much better work than this....
in Australia we call it soft drink
I’m a soda man myself
Food lion used to be huge in north Florida. We still refer to geographic locations in a way like “ you mean by the old food lion?”
Shouldn't you be drinking water in between sodas to cleanse your pallets?
Soda I'm from Maryland pop and coke I never heard those growing up
My reaction of watching thumbnail : no.........
B:soda
I’m in the Midwest and I call it soda
Im in Texas and we say soda and its almost always dr pepper
I lived in central NC a long time. Shopped at Harris Teeter sometimes, never tried their Diet cola. My favorite is Diet Coke, and in other sodas my favorite is Diet Dr. Thunder, which I think is BETTER than Diet Dr. Pepper. And 2021 makes 2020 seem like the good old days. Let's go Brandon!
R.I.P Diet Coke Here lies Mat pat quit Diet Coke
cola light /:

I'm a pop guy
I think I just call them always by name. I live in Canada, and unless we’re buying a variety we refer to it as pop?
MatPat: has an undying addiction to Diet Coke  Edd Gould: Diet Coke sucks and regular Coke is better
For me growing up coke was always just „Cola“. But Iam german so it’s obvious that it’s called different here as for you guys in the US.
Food lion is in South Carolina as well
Pop as I'm British
D. Other - Fizz / Fizzy Drink
Matpat do this again & trai fanta it coms in fruit flafors then tesd the harris teter up fanta if you have if it in stors
i think ive seen yall irl before
Fritz Kola (it’s from Germany), best cola
Pop and soda
Food Lion vs Harris Teeter is essentially North Carolina vs Duke. Publix would be NC State.
We call it softdrinks here in the Philippines.
Pepsi max be like....... ahem.....
as a texan, we do call all soda “coke”
I grew up with “Coke” but I can follow any of them. Depending on who I’m speaking with.
Try Coke with margarita mix.

WAIT THERE ARE STILL FOOD LIONS??? ALL THE ONES IN NORTH GEORGIA WENT OUT OF BUSINESS!
EYYY PUBLIX
Here in the UK my family just call it 'fizzy juice' miscellaneously, or just... What the drink is called (e.g Coke, Pepsi, ect.) Sometimes we call it soda too. I've never heard someone call it 'pop' where I'm from though.
Thanos  when he sees this video : impossible
you guys are probably full of coke after this video
b
15:30 Soda. Seriously, people. Indeed; Big K diet cola does have citric acid. I'm not a fan. Why? Diet cola tastes like metal to me. They ALL taste that way to me. However, Croaka-Cola is really bad for you, so I'm glad you gave it the boot, Mat.

Fountain diet coke shouldn't have been on the bracket because you can't get that from a groceries store
I watch this channel because of this truth and not just his favorite pop.
Should try mixing the 2 south grocery store brands
Pop in iowa
Gotta remember most sodas were medicinal back on the day. If they haven't changed the recipe that might be why it tastes like that.
Ooh Pepsi max
This video is a lie. I just watched you drink a Diet Coke in October 2021. 😅😂 Frys, Dillion’s and Food4less are the same colas
Cold drink
idk if its different in the us, but in the UK Pepsi zero sugar is called Pepsi max
Im so happy NC grocery brands be representing.
Virgil's makes excellent sugar free sodas sweetened with stevia and monk fruit. Stevia by itself is unpleasant, but somehow the monk fruit fixes it.
Despite diet coke being particularly nasty among sugar free drinks, it's curious that drinkers of diet coke, diet Pepsi, or similar don't just replace regular soda with the above - they practically replace water with it. Anyone else notice this? Helluva drug.
Every time I have had Harris Teeter soda, it tasted like swamp water.
Coke zero coke zero
Harris Teeter’s is the Saitama of Colas
I also live in north Carolina
Soda Stream's sodas are... not good. Drinkable, but not good. Nor they cost effective anymore. They always taste flat to me, even if were just mixed.
Matpat should make a diet coke product like how jacksypticie make top of the morning coffee (sorry I don't know how to spell his name)
All these years and I never knew Matt lived in the same state as me ………
i prefer pepsi max
The impossible has happened
HELLO
Thank you for confirming what I’ve already known for decades that generics can be just as good if not better than the name brands, thank you very much.

Ummmmmm where is Diet RC? RC is one of the first diet colas and tastes more like cola than most other sodas
I've always called it Soda Pop.  On my grocery list it is soda pop.  I order a soda pop.  Be more inclusive.
Hhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Food lion is actually a belgian store chain It is called delhaize here

I think it’s interesting to see  what people call soda and I think that’s cool although I split the difference between soda and pop and call it soda pop.
im a s
Cherry coke is pretty good. Especially cherry vanilla flavor  But don’t get me started on Zaxbys cherry coke, it is REALLY good. This part is unrelated to soda but Zaxbys is severely underrated, nobody talks about it but the food is so good, in my opinion it’s on-par with Chic-fil-a, especially the chicken AND THE SAUCE OH DEAR LORD THE SAUCE

"No. This one. " -Stephanie
My uncle used to work at one of those factories and he actually showed my family pictures of the exact same products going into different packaging because we didn’t believe him when he first told us and I remember being really surprised by it. Some were even “name brand” packaging which just goes to show that sometimes name brand and the store brand are the exact same product
Omg
As someone who has grown up in Florida and Georgia, are trying to tell me that Publix isn't everywhere?

I ran a regular cola blind taste test and Shasta came out number one and it still is.   Super Chill is a brand that can be found around and was not enjoyed.
Well that serves it but I would have to look at the prices and spots to put furniture and stuff
I am surprised Diet Dr Pepper is missing from the line up!

You do realize aspartame when it goes in to the body it turns in to formaldehyde. Thats embalming fluid for corpses.

I only wanna dislike this for the SOLE reason being I LOVE Diet Coke
This makes me realize what a north Carolinian I am

Yeah, our blind acceptance of aspartame is worrying...
Okay why did he mess up so many of the seedlings 😂
Pepsi is at least 100,000x better then Pepsi lmao.
You didn't include the cokes with a twist but chose a coke with a twist?
I live in Australia so i am a soft drink person🥤
I'm obviously late commenting about this, but am I the only one that doesn't understand the comparison of every diet soda to fountain diet coke when you're going to be bringing either cans or bottles home from the grocery store? Sure, a fountain diet Coke from McDonald's is not out of the question, but that's not how I imagine a lot of people get their sodas in bulk.
A
Matpat you forgot about water
I am B
I didn’t even know Kroger’s bought out Pick N’ Save. My mother worked there for years. They bought them out in 2015 and they still haven’t told the employees yet, they still think it’s owned by the two sons of the original owners because they are in all of the advertising.
what pepsi do you want me a dew
Soda from a fountain, or from a glass bottle tastes by far the best. Unfortunately it isn't sold in glass bottles anymore. At least I haven't seen them in years.
Move to pepsi
How do you stalk Diet Coke Stephanie?
Stephanie should really get on the branding train and call him Matpat on the videos. What ya'll do in private is your own business, but your public business should stay on brand.
Pop and soda
Do root beer
Considering that no diet soda is good for you that it is considered to be worse for you then  regular soda why not just go regular soda

So the lesson to learn is: the bigger companies have better sodas than weird offbrand ones
i drink so much diet coke i can tell when its at or close to expiration date by taste.
Matt: I will sustain from diet coke in 2020. 2020:full of stress, anxiety and mofana girus. Matt(staring at coke):oh you are funny.
I got a Diet Coke add on this video
I call whatever "pop" is fizzy I mean it is (hopfully) fizzy
DIET PEPSI AND COKE ZERO CHANGED THE RECIPE AND SWEETENER! DIET PEPSI HAS ASPARTAME IN IT AND COKE ZERO HAS A NEW RECIPE
Coke or pepsi? Like the video for coke and comment “Soda” for pepsi.
Be careful March madness has been trade marked!

I call it fizzy drink but in restaurant I call it soft drink  Fizzy sparkling = soft drink ?

I love how at the end it looks like some underdog in a political election spitting fire
i like that theres diet coke and it says i quit diet coke
With the revelation that "Harris Teeter" is really just Kroger, this all makes sense. Kroger is pretty well known for being sort of the secret juggernaut of the soda world. You got your Coke, and Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper, and whatever else slugging it out in the marquee fights, and then there's Kroger just quietly hanging out alongside them, sometimes packing pretty close to the same punch.
It's so weird to see a race to be the best of the worst. Like....literally ANY non-diet soda (that takes itself seriously - not the novelty nonsense) would beat the whole bracket.
Lmao you know harristeeter just got a bump in sales
C "what kinda coke do you want?" "Sprite thanks"
I like Pepsi more then cokecacler
The real answer is Pepsi Zero but the Japan Nama blend.
@FoodTheory amaxing video on sodas/pops loved it alot but to also anyone whos watched this  (whether if its the 1st time or 4th time like me lol) whoelse got to where Mat & Steph were shocked about the results for SodaStream & then got a SodaStream ad immediately after? 😂🤣 #2021
isnt diet more unhealthy then the normal one. and cherry coke is best coke imo
So, using a point system based on their placement.. it was a 3 way tie.
My uncle has that soda machine he gat it as a Christmas gift he made a lemonade soda i liked it
Calling all pop/soda "coke" is like calling every fast food restaurant McDonald's.  The south makes 0 sense
SODA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Growing up it's been soda, I have never heard of pop or coke... Well I guess till now
Fountain Coke shouldn't have been included as fountain drinks depend too much on the place that you get your cola from. Some have more carbonation than others while some have the syrup to water ratio stronger or weaker. You basically cannot get a consistent fountain cola.
<the internet is getting ready to buy or sell Coke stock depending on the outcome....watching...waiting...>
Hey MatPat, as a former maintenance mechanic, I've worked for private label bakers (bread, rolls), snack makers (pretzels, chips), and soda bottlers. I can verify that the soda bottlers typically have a "stock" recipe for each type of soda. Each store chain can have input into how the dials are set for their product. For example, more or less sugar, more or less citric acid, more or less carbonation, etc. So if it's not Coke, Pepsi, Seagrams, 7up, RC, or one of the other major bottlers, its likely produced in a private label facility.
My dad is in LOVE with Kroger’s diet orange soda.
We have a food lion and I live in Maryland
You live in north Carolina???
why don't you just replace Diet Coke with regular Coke
in answer to your q. in UK we call it fizzy. cos the bubbles in the drink make it fizzy so its a fizzy drink ^.^
Im not sure why im watching people that loves Coke when im a Pepsi lover
18:41 based on that look, if you guys weren't already married, I'd recommend marriage.
A way to check for that specific brand of diet cola might be looking for ones with citric acid, if that really is the key difference between it and the others.
all hail Diet Dr. Thunder!!
When there are no Kroger stores or subsidiaries in your state :(
Harris teeter sales after this 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈

In the UK I don't care what I call it maybe I might call it fizzy drink or when I go to a restaurant I will say coke but they only have Pepsi
I’m not a pro with numbers or anything, but I don’t think there was meant to be THREE 7th seeded colas was there😅 lol

Where's part 2, testing the new coke Zero 😭
i use the same glasses to drink diet coke
Not in a worryingly large number of countries. in a stupidly large number of countries. it's a public opinion based decision and the public opinion is based on a connotation with another sweetener that came out about the same time.
everytime he says england i sing rule britania for myself lol
I drank about 8 cans Diet Coke a day, but I found a couple of years ago, that Diet Coke changed the flavour and it was rotten, I don't know if this is a world wide thing, but it's definitely a UK thing.  Now I'm on flavoured water 💦

Diet soda is actually worse than regular soda
im from the south and we just say drink, cause you can order Sweet and unsweet tea anywhere
Water.
Not sure why I watched all this, I don't even drink soda.  You guys somehow managed to make this enjoyable to watch. 😅
as much as i hate youtubers over-diversifying their content (if that's the wrong term i just mean as in youtubes making a gaming, vlogging, movie review etc etc channels) I was curious about this subject to start with.  gotta watch the video now to see if i like it or not.  edit: nevermind I thought it was gonna be a properly science thing about the sweetener and other bad stuff in diet coke...
People that call all sodas "coke" just want to watch the world burn.

ew you like fountain more than bottle? ewww

matpat: do as i say and not as i do me: he has his reached ultimate parent form
15:18 odd, I was raised in the Midwest and I call it soda
Conk
Coke with sugar tastes like sugar coke, diet coke taste like plastic-aspartam-flavored, non sugared coke. why are we still doing this?
Weasle walks into a bar and goes up to the bar keep.   "What'll  you have?"  "Pop"

Food Theory? Are we playing with our food now?
as a diet coke addict im wildly curious about this harris teeter business
Pop and soda
I would sub to anyone that would to sub me
coke plus s better than diet coke
I quit soda, caffeine and sugar. I've never felt better. Just get rid of it.
I'm from the Midwest and have never called it pop
Diet Coke is terrible for you! Stop drinking it!
lol
Why does he have a different hair cut in the thumbnail than in the video?
Mat goes through Diet Coke like I go through tea.
You got to make sure that store brands are not a coke or Pepsi company.  Korger store brand icecream is blue bunny ice cream and korger brand coffee is green mountain.  🤯🤦‍♂️🤦🏽‍♀️🤷‍♂️🤷🏽‍♀️
Yeah, I could have told you Diet Pepsi wasn't going to last: it tastes like they have a captive market and they know it...
POP POP POP
Those zevias slap
for boylan just get the blueberry or regular cola
so passionate about telling differences about different soda
My mom grew up calling everything “Coke”, my dad “Pop”. She thought “pop” made absolutely no sense, and made a joke about how he wasn’t allowed to teach us to call it pop, and soda was as far as she’d go. 25 years later he’s stuck to that for the entirety of their marriage, his longest running joke. I tend to say soda, but occasionally a “coke” will pop out when I want root beer.
well done mat you just consumed 1000000000 calories  of diet coke
Fountain drinks always win since it's the freshes mix
I have in Gainesville ga but both food lion close like 5-7 years ago rip food lion 🦁 you are missed
What happens when Matthew gives up diet cola? Absolute terror that 2020 caused (don’t worry it was not ur fault matthew)
diet soda is worse for you than normal soda
I am an employee at Food Lion and I’ve never had the Diet Cola, now I need to try it
Try water...
Diet Coke is the best of the worst.
Depends sometimes I'm soda other times I'm cola, also I'm gonna guess Harris Teeter might make it to the end
we call it Kazoza in egypt, and something cold, or cold drink
I know I'm late to the party but it was really enjoyable to watch this competition and it was shocking to me as well seeing a last minute filler entry actually become your new favorite.  As for what people call it here in Canada. They're call it Coke but if speaking generally about it it becomes interchangeable between pop and coke.
Huh, there's a Harris Teeter a mile from my house. Guess I know what I'll be getting after work tomorrow
Very interesting
As I have just picked up and read the PJO/HoO books... Would Matpat be a child of Athena or a child of Dionysis?
Most of the south says soda but some do say coke
If you want a really good cola, Rocket Fizz specialty shop in Raleigh carries Moxie! It's the official soda of Maine (we even have a festival for it!) so it's pretty common here but not a lot of places outside of Maine have it. They carry it on the regular though so you should give it a try!
Choosing the fountain drink is biased because it will always taste better than the bottle and/or can because the syrup from the soda is kept apart separately from the CO2 that gets delivered .
No way this can’t be real
B BRO
I call it Soda
Coca-cola was originally made for people when they are sick before Coca-Cola became soda
The reason for the difference in taste is pretty simple actually. Plastic always flavors EVERYTHING that is put in it, that is why cans still exist. They are viewed as the more "pure" flavor. The BIGGEST difference though is between the fountain and the others because the sweetener is COMPLETELY different. Fountain soda is sweetened with Sucralose and the other 2 are sweetened with Aspartame. Good on ya Matt Pat for being able to taste the difference
In this region of the UK, all cola is coke, but coke is a type of pop or fizzy drink
Pop? Soda? wtf are those in Latvia we call it ŠŅABIS jk its just whatever the sodas name is like we call coke coke and sprite sprite ect it doesnt really have a defined name for all sodas in general
0_0   Yay!!!!!
In Scotland we call all fizzy drinks...  fizzy juice
just drink regular coke and less often
Grew up in the south and I hear all these people saying in the south they just say coke then get asked what kinda coke they want but I grew up in low country South Carolina and it was always called soda
How are you actually suppose to eat leftover cake? Do you microwave it, re-heat it I need the oven, or do you eat it cold? (Matpat notice me pLeAsE)
pepsi max
Be careful, as the sign warns “Kroger Staples Dick’s”

I clicked on this video hoping to get some tips to get over my Diet Coke addiction
Harris Teeter wins!
O-O i clicked as soon as I saw the thumbnail
I would love to see the guy who is stocking the Harris Teter shelves a couple days after this video came out and was wondering why all their store brand diet soda was gone. And then how it kept disappearing.
Diet Coke for life.
15:30 1
Funny I JUST switched from diet coke to publix diet cola. Bought it on a whim one day and find it taste better to me. Plus roughly half the cost.
I am unsubing now
why diet?
Me before I watched the video WHAT!!!!!!
this video is on my birthday even though its been 6 months i do not care lol
SODA
I expected you to be smarter than to be a "diet" drinker....
Mat without diet coke ITS THE END OF THE WORLD😱
and after this video Harris Teeter made millions
It’s gotta be from Kroger. Kroger brand is magical. If you like chocolate milk… kroger brand is the way
A definitely pop but I'm from Ohio so makes sense
Soda.here in Greece means carbonated water lol
Kroger can be found in southern Illinois ; Mariano's can be found more in the suburbs of Illinois ; Food 4 Less you will find more so on the border of Indiana like north east side. Might have to go to all 3 hmhmh...
D: Soft Drink
No Diet Dr Pepper :(
I have a suggestion: use water.
We used to have a food lion around us when I was a infant but it closed when I was 3 and me and my dad went there pretty much everyday and we moved from there twice since.
0:16 waittttt is that that nugget dude from that weird school game???
I've stopped buying all coke products which meant finding a new cola.  The store brand cola is actually very good.  Big K cola is one I've tried that I like very much.  An old brand I hadn't had since a kid, but was very good, was RC cola too.
Never understood diet sodas. How about you just not drink them? If you are, just drink one a day. 🤔🤔🤔
Nc sodas are made with love! ...& a hint of Granny's RX from her cabinet >.> lol
B sorry pop sounds wack af
I live in this lovely little section of MD where I have both a Kroger and a Harris Teeter withing 5 miles of me. I'm gonna go try to see if they are the same
2 words of THE best soda Board Walk aka save a lot brand aka moutain holler

Huh I didn’t know how many cool you tubers live in NC until I started looking for it
Hold up  There’s a soda specialty shop near your house?!!  Wtf?!!

soft drink- Australia
I say soft drinks
*Laughs in "Αναψυκτικό" (Ana-psi-kti-ko)*
I've had Diet Sams before and I loved it. Lets gooooooo 12:46
i am this way with root bear tbh
Coke 🇮🇪
Matpat, You are the reason that I quit mostly soda and now my addiction is water.
As a life-long Diet Coke drinker, I firmly believe that it was the primary cause of my acid reflux and esophageal erosion. I recommend you don't drink it at all...but if you do, please PLEASE don't drink it past mid-afternoon. You need to clear all that carbonation out long before bedtime.  I've replaced my Diet Coke habit with water flavorings and I can't even go back now. For caffeine, I highly recommend Great Value (Walmart house brand) Pomegranate Lemonade - or for half the caffeine, try the Peach Mango Green Tea. There are other caffeinated flavors...but for me, they're too tart or too sweet to drink all day.
Pop
Juice
In Philippines it's called soft drink
I hate diet Coke wooph
You are forgetting Kroger (Big K) diet cola. I drink that and it is the best so far. Better than diet coke. Even IGA has better diet cola.
Cheers from  Canada. We have a President's Choice store brand of products, including sodas. For a time the made PC BLUE WAVE cola. Had citric acid, was my personal favourite. Good stuff.
Soft drink
In my country, we call it "Soft Drink" I don't Know why, people in Australia are weird.
As a North Carolinian, it felt weird to see Food Lion and Harris Teeter mentioned in a  video. It's definitely soda btw.
TIL: Harris Teeter and Food Lion are NC Based.
i know that it isn't a cola, and you probably won't see this, but pretty please try moxie on film, as a Mainer it would make my year, although it might be difficult to obtain.
Me: i want to be like Matthew Matthew: dont be like me friends
I really think u should make a theory about Bob's burgers
food Lion is in Georgia too dude
Top 10 anime betrayals
Me:* reads the title * also me: THE END OF THE WORLD IS NEAR
im a coke
We dont call our soda anything, lets say I someone asks me if I want any soda, they would say "you want coke or sprite?" I'm from asia lol
Ew zevia taste horrible
Fountain diet coke likely has a higher syrup to water mix.  Cole makes more money if a restaurant uses more syrup per serving AND they make more when bottles and cans have a lower percentage of syrup.
I can agree, Kroger store brand is either just as good as  or even better than the big name brands.
diet rite is great 10:05
Soda
I like when they’re talking I feel like I’m dumb
23:18 none of those stores are in nebraska.. oOOF atleast im not familiar with them-
fake
Next thing you know studies are gonna say citric acid is just straight up the key to immortality.
B
Mat: we need a filler Also mat: you know what it wins
I just call it a soft drink
I got braces and I then quit juice as a whole and now only drink water lol
Sodie pops
why does matpat like diet coke so much
"Food Lion beat diet pepsi - way to rep North Carolina"  Matpat, they're both North Carolina
A lot of store brands are made by a named brand company. For example you might be comparing Coke with Coke from a store brand.
me reads title  also me who are you and what have you done with matpat
boylan root beer is the best
This is what happens when they don't sponsor a video
coke
*reads title* Hah funny
Ha! You fool! I know all this stores and been to them because you in the same place I am in I been in food lion almost entire my life and been in Harris teeter on a budget
Kroger should literally made their own cafe dude Like with a diet soda and stuff I mean, Instead of suplying, Why not shine yourself? Like you will just get more credit.
I come back her randomly to hear matpat talk about food lion because it makes me happy to know about something not many people would know about
Food lions logo looks like an exact copy of a Belgian store chain Delhaize Kinda weird
Wait....what state are y'all living in? Cause you keep saying south and I live in Texas, so if it's Florida, I am 100% coming to finally meet my favorite scientific people ON THE PLANET!! It won't be soon though 😂
Coke really missed the boat on this one.  They could have been quietly pushing their brand of sugar flavoured poison, but now Matt's loyalties lie elsewhere.
here in nz we're fizzy.
Those grocery store ones are a great alternative to the name brand stuff. My mother always buys them and I never think twice about it to be honest.
I say soda, I’m originally from Massachusetts but last year I moved down to North Carolina, once I moved down the sodas here are oddly good
I understand this ranking thing isnt for the most important thing in the world, but I feel like it would be more accurate if they werent told the names of the colas until the very *end,* that way for them itd always be in question whether big hitters like Coke Zero or Diet Coke were actually still in the tournament or not
I just moved to Minnesota and they call it Sodie and every time I hear that I wanna punch someone in the face
I have always called it Coke and I’m originally from Oklahoma
Soda-er from the Midwest
The best soft drink. The nectar off odin  Irn bru
Being from North Carolina, it's always been soda. Because Pepsi, Born in North Carolina, is the main thing. Coke is here, so I can't just call everything Coke or Pepsi
Just as a fair warning some diet drinks do contain aspartame which has in some cases caused brain tumors as what happened to an aunt of mine she drank a lot of Diet Coke and it actually led to her having brain tumor recently and the doctors believe the leading cause of the brain tumor was the aspartame
Well I know what I'm going to do when I find a harris teeter.
As Plankerton holds up the crabby patty recipe, he adds citric acid and then dominates the Krusty Krab.
Matt should make a diet coke poster
Coke Zero is legit addicting
Technically picking the three versions of diet coke in the beginning is not true to the test, you cant just buy a case of fountain diet coke to take home. it should have been a battle of tin or plastic and even glass
Fizzy drink
Non of those shops are here because most places' names are not even in english
i am ''frisdrank'' i'm dutch lol
I like to call it Soda Pop lol
Matt is Edduardo from eddsworld
were i am we call it bubbly syrup drink
i love how i might go to the same grocery store as my favorite youtuber
I pronounce it zev-vi-a
I’m also from the midwest so it’s Pop.
U missed the trick top of the pops
I am a soda man
What's the deal with your wife and pepper?
I would recommend Foxen park cola but it’s not diet
I was told it's called fizzy drinks
They will break up in 2 years
Other that being carbonated hydration cylinder
B:soda
I live in Ireland and we call it fizzy drinks, and if you want something without fizz it’s called soft or if it’s a fizzy drink that’s lost it’s fizz it’s called flat and we use flat 7 up as a medicine for car sickness

The genuine shock on Stephanie's face is priceless
I get food lion ads and I don't love in an area where food lion is
Lol, Kroger is the king of almost every grocery store. Learned that from my current job, smiths, dillons, fred meyer, frys, the whole list. Its all Kroger.
D
D. Here is sa at a restaurant they’ll say do you want coke Fanta or whatever or maybe say what fizzy drink you want
Pop
Have a pepsi.
In England we just call them fizzy drinks or soft drinks.
Pop for life
Food lion is a subsidiary of Belgium based delhaize.
Down in the south it’s all coke   Represent North Carolinians !
I'm so happy Harry Teeter won
How much do you think they had to pee
why am i salty over a soda competition?
*cough cough* pop or coke not soda *cough cough* Sorry choked on my Haris teeter diet cola.
To the theorists I have a game theory  and yes this is food theory  but still I have a game theory for Henry stikmin fleeing the complex where the wall is pwees do it
I am a bit frustrated that original and natural cola's sucked
crack open a cold root beer, maybe a cold one or 2?
I fancy a cup fizzy every blue moon🎩
Imma tell you this right people but the whole 0 calories is a lie that stuff has more sugar in it then normal soda yeah let that bit of information skin in that diet soda has way more sugar then normal soda and I learned this fact from a very close friend of mine and if you don’t believe me go look it up before saying your opinions under my comment I’m just telling you all what I know because that oddly enough is true so yeah enjoy drinking sugar labeled as diet soda
I am a og who remembers EVERYTHING in my life
I am a b man
Diet faygo cola tho
https://youtu.be/nnVDKHHxiWM
I think you guys might have just solved the krabby patty secret formula...it's citric acid, don't tell Plankton
Is food lion not a national chain?
A
15:33 even though nobody will see this in good 'ol England, we typically just call them 'fizzy drinks' doesnt sound as cool but thats how we be. We do say soda water sometimes for fizzy water or just say fizzy/ sparkling water
What about Cockta?     (A Yugoslavian version of coca cola that's still around)
Alternate title: Trying different variations of liquid garbage, comparing them to other variations of liquid garbage and acting surprised about the flavors of garbage!
Hey something about diet sodas that I like for you to investigate. When I was in high school someone told me that any type of soda that had the word diet and it had embalming fluid in it to make it as a diet drinks. So I got to ask is that even true?
Try diet cola coffee
Schizer diet soda pop
The true nectar of the gods is french coke. Cane sugar is just inherently better than high fructose corn syrup. Even the diet coke (Coca light) over there tastes better. mat you need to do an international version because I swear even diet coke and coke light have a different taste
This championship went like your local sports anime lol
This is why March Madness works!
D We’re I’m from its Cola
food theory need face reveal
Wish he had Vimto Diet Cola from the UK.
B
Im D: Fizzy
I actually say “carbonated beverages” most, although that is because I don’t like carbonation so that is the fastest way to get people to stop offering me drinks I don’t want. (Otherwise I say soda.)
B
Bro, Diet Coke will NEVER let you down....it's always your friend.
Less is more with stevia they need to decrease the amount by half
D : fizzy drink
Lemme help out, Steph CAN’t believe it.
I do t think they call it pop in the Midwest in anymore like since the 50s
Brit here. Always referred to them as fizzy drinks
This is an odd video. I mean objectively, cola isn't that interesting and diet cola is worst than that... So it is a video about the best worst kind of something that isn't particularly special.
Ya’ll all wrong, it’s not pop, or soda, it’s fizzy drinks.
Diet can coke is same as diet coke
Not sure if someone already said this but if you guys both chose Diet Coke for 2nd place, that means it wins. The other sodas finished 1st and 3rd which means they tie for 2nd place and you have no 3rd due to the tie.
Why did you not include RC cola.
I just realised that in the opening when you go through the restaurant when you go through the door you can see Kevin from the office dropping his famous chili
i say softdrink: D
I'll be honest, while I'm not a fan, it's really true, if there is a wide variety of sources for a drink, you'll have a lot of differences in flavor, for instance, fountain against bottle against can. the differences are as follows, fountain actually tastes the sweetest between the three cause it's the most carbonated whereas the bottle can be the most bitter because it has the least carbonation out of the three, it's also why if you leave your bottle of soda out in the sun compared to your fountain drink, the bottle will have gone flat sooner then the fountain drink... if you don't put any ice in the fountain drink that is, which is another thing that adjusts the flavor, if you drink it cold, iced, or hot (and by hot I mean room temp). things to consider drink/soda fans.
In Australia we just call all of it Lemonade, it’s kinda weird but it’s just what we call it lol
Wht about Pepsi max
Dude. When i was poor I would collect quarters and use them to buy Kroger vending machines sodas. Big k and the other products in that line were my favorite sodas of all time and I would stock up on them. I was just thinking about how awesome that store brand is when I watch this video and of course it wins!
Ok funny man I’ll leave comment to help with algorithm
Now when I move to South Carolina, I'm going to have to pit Harris Teeter against Kroger in a battle royale for best diet cola.    Of course, I'm a diet pepsi kinda person.  But this harris teeter cola has my interest
Here is Australia we call soda softdrink :edit: my guess is bc it’s not beer
Pepsi Max or Coke Zero.
Harris teeter is A1
The end of an Era
I would rather die to a hundred thousand rabid squirrels than give up Diet Dr. Pepper. This pandemic has been challenging because sometimes it's hard to find the stuff. I went to the store today and they only had two 12 packs and the 6 pack bottles that weren't on sale. The last time, our local store didn't even have any and the guy was stocking with none on his cart.
Coke Zero>>>>>>Diet Coke
im allergic to sugar. So i had the stevia option. And i became addicted to it
Thank you for being safe from the Die coke
Good olé Soda XD
Im a Fanta
12:00 I’m so used to seeing cursive at the moment I thought it said “Diet Sans Cola”
I’m fine with my normal coke
Well here in the Netherlands (at least my family) we just call it cola. You guys in America are all like:” hey mom we’re out of coke” while us dutch people be like:”hey mom we’re out of cola”. Oh yeah, we always get the store brand version instead of actual Coca Cola, except for grandparents.
for some reason when i was a kid i used to make soda cocktails, i would like mix two or more sodas, a lemon, or lime, then i would mix it and give it to someone
In the uk Pepsi zero is Pepsi max
20:53 Steph: Who are you and what've you done to my husband?
15:29  D, we call it, wait for it...            Bepsi.
The comment about Pepsi Zero sugar made me a little confused. Pepsi Zero sugar looks like Pepsi Max and was once called Pepsi Max but with a quick google I found out that it is not the Pepsi Max others have known since the 90s.  Coke No Sugar which was once called Coke Zero here in Australia is my go to diet cola. Pepsi Max is the other one. I'd give them both up in a heartbeat if we had the gloriousness that is Cherry Coke.  As for what I call it I'm an other. Being an Aussie I call it soft drink.
Red Jacket Guy FNAF Guy And now he is  The Diet Coke Guy!
Diet Dr.Pepper
Food Lion sodas are, overall, pretty good.  I actually prefer them over the big name sodas.  Although unlike you I prefer citrus sodas to diet sodas
Zero sugar coke tastes way better than diet coke
Any of my soft drink gang here?
Sorry but I call soda cocaine
*WHAT? YOU DID NOT HAVE WISCONSINCOLA!?*  Typical LA guy, only knows of mainstream stuff… 😉🤣
Colorado fan here. I'll check my King Soopers and sample the Kroger diet.
Steph: I walk in and they ask what coke I want. me: walks in 2 pounds please yes 2 pounds
I can actually get Red Cream Soda from Fred Meyer's around here.  It isn't too shabby.  It was hard to find a Red Cream in the PNW let alone a good one...so it is interesting that Kroger Brands did well here too.
Mat should develop his own diet cola
People:COKE IS BETTER!NO PEPSI!  me with my dr pepper:hmm..Wonder what they're doing?
Boyland root beer is amazing in my opinion
XD as I'm drinking zevia ginger ale xD
D:Juice or fizzy drink or fizzy juice, weird from Scotland
I don't believe this
I wonder what matt patt thinks of the new diet coke that just came out
Coke viva Texas!
Stevia is much better in small doses. People usually use as much Stevia as they would other sweeteners, but you actually use half.
I use pop or soda. I normally just call it by its brand name though. I don't drink much soda as I base what I like off texture alot and I largely dislike the sensation of bubbles on my tounge. So yeah, I have only enjoyed raspberry and creme (which have since been discontinued in my area sadly) and Fanta orange
pop
MatPat quitting Diet Coke is like us quitting breathing
I QUIT ICE CREAM,
Diet champagne kola it is a brand from puerto rico
otherrrrr
Dog with the butter
Butter dog
I tend to say pop more often but occasionally I will say soda
Him:i stopped drinking diet coke Me: I WANT TO BUT I HAVE DIABETES REEEEEEEE
We call it fizzy
My home state is representing
Do restaurants garnish with citrus fruits like lemon or lime for this reason???
Imagine if diet coke win 🏆
i'm soda, grew up in cali, we all call it soda on the west coast (except north washington, there it's soda pop)
I feel like they were both talking about different things
For me in the UK (I don’t know if recipes are different over here but what you call Pepsi Zero, we call Pepsi Max) it goes like this:  1: Pepsi Max 2: Diet Coke 3: Pepsi Diet 4: Coke Zero
Rhett and link hate everything 365 brand, so that was an easy guess
Matt cola life is flavoured With stevia
15:28 D. Soft Drink
Can't relate
I'm from the midwest and I've called it soda all my life lol
"I just simultaneously whipped and nae nae'd"
Cole
Who Else Wondered What Happened To The Rest Of That Soda? xD
Up here in ohio we said pop
b soda
Fanta
This is how we say soda
газировка
In the uk, our Pepsi zero sugar is called Pepsi max
Is there an all of the above option??
Nah, soft drink is the correct term for a fizzy drink.
HEB cola is delicious just saying
To answer the question at 15:28, I refer to the drinks with a few names, like soft drink and fizzy drink. But recently, I've dropped the 'soft' and 'fizzy' from the names, so it's kinda funny when I ask my sibling "Hey, do you want some _d r i n k?"_
14:51 the moment you realize both are made in nc
Dude I love zevia it’s awesome
Unironically and my family is the only one to do this we will forever call soda drank. just drank. I think this is how they said it in the fifties
So, as someone who lives in Georgia, Coke is used to described any Coca Cola product (because Atlanta) and therefore used to describe any coke product.  However, I use coke to describe Coca Cola and soda to describe any carbonated drink.  Pop is more of a midwest word for soda. Like Iowa and Ohio.  I legit got into a rant about this with a friend from Ohio 🤣
Where I grew up instead of calling it soda we call that diabetes
😭☠🧍🏻‍♂️
If you ever do this again, I recommend using a mug that you can't see through.
24:00 PFFFFFFFT! BAHHHHHHHHHH HA!

warren buffet is disappointed with you lol i will go to kroger and check this out
So im not only one who thought they taste different. Thank god i thought im driving crazy
i find it funny this is my favorite episode of food theory seeing as i’m allergic to aspartame jsjsjdjdj   (edit: i basically just get a horrible migraine and stomach ache for a day if i drink something with aspartame in it, it makes me feel like i have the flu)
did you just say I probably never heard of food lion I go there like every day
You guys taste buds a weird every single Diet Coke for me tastes exact same as every single normal Coke in the whole world
I call it soda in my opinion pop it is a completely different word and Cola is A type of soda.
QFC has the same soda. I was sitting here looking it up as I drank it watching this. Yeah might be the same thing.
Sodastream. 1.5 gallons of diet cola a day.
Diet sprite
SW PA calls it Pop ... lets all agree than Soda Pop people are universally wrong ... Pick one.
Wow
I am d I am growing up calling it fizzy drink since we’re weird in the uk
finally this dude does something other sitting in front of the mic talking also we dont see you guys enough show ur webcam more
Other:cool drink
fun fact: pepsi was released before coca cola
Anyone gonna mention how he drank diet coke in the hot ones video which came out in 2020. Matpat you've been exposed!
Anyone gonna mention how he drank diet coke in the hot ones video which came out in 2020. Matpat you've been exposed!
My uncle is the COO of sodastream and I don't like soda but when I tried it it's really syrupy when it started but it got alot better in recent years
try to order coke energy i think there is a diet version and its really good
The language we use where I live call it limonada which directly translate to lemonade.....so D
in new zealand we call it fizzy, cause it fizzes
In the Philippines, we call all soda and carbonated drinks as "softdrinks".
I live in Georgia and I live right beside an food lion
Stephanie couldn’t comprehend that Harris Teeter won
There’s a food lion not too far from my house and I don’t live in North Carolina
Rock paper scizzors the secret science technique that super secretly decides all science ever... how did they come to have such power?...
B and c
15:20 SODA is the best choice because it's literally made with Soda water. pop you in the nose for reducing sodapop to pop. calling it just coke or pepsi is a sign you're an uncultured swine, there's more than just one brand of soda.
when they tried the old fashioned soda it reminded me when i drank a rootbeer from an natural herb shop... was literally a root soda, not very modern rootbeer.
i hope he mentions the neurotoxins in the artificial sweetner.... this is a soda taste off not a harsh analytical look at diet coke...
MatPat: You've probably never heard of Food Lion Me: Wait...people don't know about Food Lion? (I live in Tennessee btw)
Diet Cola. The only thing that brings me joy.
I’m a ‘ soft drink ‘ person
Nani
I am Coke Zero simp
Diet Cola is way, way, waaayyyy worse for you than sugary drinks. Both are unhealthy but all these claims of "Zero calories" and "health drink" BS that companies push are all bollocks. With sugar, you can control how much you intake and plan your diet around it. Sweetner has had a long history of health problems, many specialist admit to not understanding what sweetner does to your body, and many studies showing connections between sweetner and brain deterioration.  Really you shouldn't drink either but I refuse to drink sweetner because of what I've personally seen.  Also it tastes fucking disgusting!
15:28 I’m something else. We here in England say like a fizzy drink. Or a Can. Like a can of….and then you would say the fizzy drink that you want so a can of coke, a can Fanta, a can of sprite
Not-So-Fun-Fact: Diet Coke has Citric acid as well
I live in Charlottesville, Virginia, and I tried some of the Harris Teeter Diet Cola. And you are 100% right, I see what you mean by it having a fruity kick to it. I also see what you mean by it’s enhancement in Flavor, Carbonation, and sweetness. It’s all perfect. It’s really good soda!
Fizzy drink. Australia
I’m from England, (in the North) and we called it fizzy.
Are you kidding me?! Of COURSE Kroger is supplying the best sodas!!! XD
Fun fact coke was once used as medicine so make sense why the company that has been using the same recipe for over 100 years would taste like some sort of medicine
Coke = soda in Houston. Yep, it makes little sense... but I guess it's like "q-tip" or "band-aid," as they say.
I'm probably pop since I live in Canada we call it pop so I think I am a pop person
them: hello internet it is game/food/etc. theory me: hello fellow brawlers it is time for brawl theory
I've been waiting my whole life for a Piggy Game Theory.... I'm still waiting :/ (I've been keeping my mind off by commenting on videos with jokes and stuff but nothing is keeping my mind off)
what about 7up
I did this with root beer, and A&W won 🏆
I didn't diet coke was a drug?! Edit: Guess like he's a cola fan  ANOTHER EDIT: WAIT WHEN I WAS A KID I DRUNK BEER!!! BUT IT WAS ROOT BEEER YEAH BEER .... I DRUNK BEER BEFORE UH I UHM UHHHHH EEEEE
pls they’re so cute hhhh
nOOOOOOOOO0000

I have an addiction of water
I call it fizzy drink
Out of the gate, this kind of failed when it did not include diet coke in a glass bottle for the choice of contenders. The can has a plastic lining (cans are not actually just metal anymore), the bottle was plastic, too. The glass bottle would have had a slightly different taste as well. I thought the "king" of coke would account for that.
i understood nothing, yet it was still entertaining
Congratulations on three mill
Soft drink
I call it soda
Im from ireland and we call them fizzy drinks or just drinks
Diet MTN DEW  I could tell the difference between MTN DEW in a MTN DEW can and a Diet MTN DEW can
Shasta is bad. If you handed Shasta to me and told me it was coke or something I'd think you soaked dirty pennies in it or something.
Fun fact: when you drink from a straw, some of your spit goes into that drink. You're welcome!
: how much soda & mentos would it take to fill and erupt a volcano
My favorite part is when Food Lion beats Pepsi and he says NC represent and Pepsi was also originally made in New Bern NC. NC couldn't lose!
SODAS ASSEMBLE
Best- Harris Teeter Best you are likely to find- Fountain Diet Coke Best if you want zero sugar- Diet Coke Zero
if someone were to replicate this, to avoid knowing which is which, you could go through the entire bracket blind and only the person who gives them the cola would know how the bracket looks entire time
I thought it would stay diet coke
Just came to say I'm glad your trying to get off the wagon. You've been banging diet cokes for too long, eventually itll take you and make you lose the ones you love. We are all rooting for you mattypatty
Hey matpat will you do a console channle
#pop
I live in SC and work at Publix, and food lion and Harris Teeter are quite common down here
I call it other: soda pop.  they are one and the same, also matpat will probably never read this because he is mainly game theory :)

I'm a soda person lmao ~  I also lived in NC a few years ago and my god I remember some of the weird food lion brand names for their sodas
I’m in the south so every thing is coke Georgia
I live in the UK :(
The intro is fire
When I was a kid I drank regular Coca Cola. In adulthood, to cut down on my sugar I switched to Diet Coke. I didnt love it but it was OK. Then I tried Coke Zero. I was ecstatic. Finally I found a diet cola that tasted like regular Coke.
*BRUH*
We call it pop in oregon
Why don't you drink green tea
personally, i'm a "Läsk" guy. (for the what do you call soda thing)                  Because i'm swedish
here in brazil, is "zero sugar" coca-cola, not diet ( i never even seen one in my life of the diet line)
Taste aside, the health of this is kind of tantamount to giving up cigarettes for pipe tobacco. Especially when we're talking about "diet" sodas.
Hopefully Matt knows the history behind Coca-Cola
Greg Doucette wants to know your location Mat
I’m pop
Being a food theorist veteran i am mildly disappointed that he choose something other than Diet Coke
I'm not American so Im the neither catagory I call it mineral, not joking😂  any Irish peeps out there will understand
Yes! Finally someone who understands that there are taste diffrences between cans, bottles and  fountain!  Only 1 person i know agrees that there is!
water is better than all of these
I call it a coke
Pop
You guys should do a taste test to determine was the best Diet soda is in general. I'd put money down that Diet AW Rootbeer and Diet Dr Pepper ends up in the finals!
I call it pop
b
I grew up calling them cold drinks
soDA
i have one in florida called ur mom
I’m watching this while downing Diet Cokes XD
Wait is Food Lion just an NC thing? I see them everywhere in NC...I just assumed it was a big thing like Walmart but I guess not-
Im from Louisiana and I call it coke.
In my country Food Lion is called: Delhaize
I always call it what it is high fructose corn syrup
Coke
Bruh I work at a Harris teeter. And I also shop there as well. Ht brand products are honestly some of the best store branded products around and are even better than some name brands too also Kroger is technically  harris teeter.
I am cold drink
you call it pepsi zero sugra and not pepsi max? Weird...
My favorite coke is Kofola witch Is probably exclusive to cetral Europe so idk if that would be a suitible chage if it is not for sale in us
This is like switching from morphine to dilaudid
Steph at the end: WHat wHaoT
I here in NZ say Fizzy
pls mak a battle cats game theory episode pls
This is exactly whenever the joke character becomes a top tier
MatPat: oh this one is sweeter but this one isn’t as good Me: COLA IS COLA
i'm from the south as well! however i say soda so people know what i'm talking about :(
soda
I came here to see Pepsi win……..I was greatly disappointed.
Your cute that's no theory
I actually hate Harris Teeter soda so this is funny to me.
why pepsi is not cola but its diet pepsi hmmmmmm
there were a lot of mouth sounds in this one
B
fizzy drinks/soft drinks in general. never call it sodapop here in australia
monster
It's soda. STOP DRINKING IT
7:47 Cola is originally developed by a pharmacist as an alternative cough syrup, then as a mix-in for whiskey to try to mask the medicine taste, didn't really catch on, so, soda water was added to make it more palatable, and the rest is history
D: Other (Spicy juice)
Boylan is actually REALLY good at making soda. I can’t speak on their diet products but their cream soda and birch/root beer is absolutely amazing
Watch coke instantly start adding citric acid to their sodas
Cant believe we are relying on rock paper scissors on the best soda
Food Lion’s packaging looks like Hanafords packaging for all my New England friends. It may be the same.
what about coke zero? its better than the origonal (in my opinion) edit: so I didnt see it in the pile at first i didnt finish the video yet but its there my mistake
MatPat you should look into a soda called fintmen Logo on the campus of a dog it’s gonna sound weird but there’s a flavor of it is literally dandelion and burdock might be what you’re looking for it’s made of New England
"We at Food Theorists do not support mass consumption of Diet Coke despite Mat's inexplicable ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis" Yeah sounds about right.   Edit: HOLY GUACAMOLE 1K LIKES??? THANK YALL SO MUCH THIS IS THE MOST LIKES IVE EVER GOTTEN SERIOUSLY THANK YOU!!!
I'm soda
Could you do a Theary about the different brands and seeing if the soda taste the same
Coca-Cola
Maybe too haris teeter vs fanta
In the uk or at least where I live pop is for all drinks except water and sometimes even some foods
This is honestly on my favorite episodes
D other
I Iive in Virginia and I have a food lion and a Harris teeter
If u quit Diet Coke, start doing Diet Pepsi. It taste pretty similar.
Way for Matt to make me feel bad about knowing what a food lion is XD
All four, I have a very mixed family. There all great though :D
!CONTENTS SPOILERS! MatPat: I QUIT DIET COKE Me: *(Watch)* Matpat: I like harris teeter the best Me: Wut...
As someone who has lived in Tennessee for like 17 years, I have heard of Publix and Food Lion. And yes, it's coke, no matter the brand. Used to be soda but I have been converted...y'all
NOOOOO I WATCH VIDS TO STOP THINKING ABOUT MY WORKPLACE AND MY COMPANY SNUCK ITS WAY INN
I like Pepsi more
I'm sorry do people not no what food lion is
I like Dr Pepper more than he likes Diet Coke, trust me
Try Diet Pepsi
I’m pop
I have nearby Harris teeter stores let’s goo
Coke
I’m drinking Diet Coke while watching this actually
D, other  we called it.. *D R I N K E R S*  edit: we only called it this in one shop, but it's closed now (rip)
Funny enough i drink fred meyer soda
Every time i drink coke i always pour water before i pour coke
When you work at a food lion
I have soda stream
3:45 curse you subtitles
Ever drink caffeine free coke? It's not bad.
15:30 I like coke
what about irn bru?
14:35 food lion ? FOOD LION ?! WHAT DID THEY DO TO THE DELHAIZE?!?
I am on the soft drink team here in Australia
As a Kroger employee yes all the sodas are the same thing Nationwide
B
Diet soda isn't technically any better than regular soda...
I just name it what it is.
I drink regular Pepsi all day everyday
Coke GANG
It’s pop
I mean, I can't believe Mat can even get pepsi down his throat. It is really bad
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
i liive in nc
It's just the best excuse to just drink a lot of Pop
Him:I quit diet coke  People who didnt watch the video : not my problem nerd
In South Africa, we call Soda Cold Drinks/Cooldrink depending on context.
His jacket kinda looks like starlords
It’s soft drink, sorry not sorry
Sodaaaaaaa
Oh god this is scary, i am drinking diet coke and this showed up in my recommended,
We've got a Kroger grocery 5 minutes from the house, so I might pick up some Big K® Cola Oh! Zero Calorie Soda (The problem is that it's sold in both a bottle and a can)
D Other: Their names. I... I call them their names.
There is a great disturbance in the Coke Zero... they changed it "Now More Delicious"???
Diet coke is my religion
Dr Pepper
I want bts
If you're quitting diet coke, matpat, then why is this video still #dietcoke
14 minutes in and I felt I have gone through several chapters
I live in India and here we have a soda called bovonto, it’s not diet, but it had a fruity flavour. After watching this video, I thought it might have citric acid and when I checked ingredients, I WAS RIGHT!!!😀😀
I go to the store for a good ol' Fizzy Drink
Why you quit diet coca you love diet coca is part of your chnnall
I didnt even realize that people might not know what a food lion is. Ive lived in nc for most of my life so its weird to think about that
Mat will pass out when he gets sponsored by diet coke (WHEN)
it's Soda
I miss caffeine free regular Pepsi. Yes it existed and it was glorious. My main is regular Pepsi and Arizona lemon ice tea
Noooooooooooooo matpat noooo
I love my soda stream, but I have to put half or less what they say in, and it has to be diet dr pete which would not fit into this. But, yeah, for anyone who was thinking about sodastream, half the amount of syrup, holy cow, I don't know why they tell you so much.
I prefer one single. Soda. And that is Canada dry
cheerwine is best
Me: *Lives in Georgia* Also me: What is Food lion and wtf is Harris Teeter?
10:26 Video solely for this. Pole....
I’m a pop dude
Kroger soda is the ONLY generic soda I drink
Isn't stevia causing cancer?
I’m back in Virginia to visit home and went straight back to Harris Teeter to buy this, I’m drinking it now!!!! 👏👏👍👍 it’s so good 🌷
i live in virginia son i have food lion but im surprized that it is only aroud nc and va
LAIR. You're drinking diet coke again
Hold up.  If the contestant sodas have to be ones you can get 'readily available,' doesn't that automatically disqualify any *fountain* drinks?  Should've put the can or bottle version in.  Also I'm surprised that Shasta was seed 13, since it's the biggest brand I know of - there's more Shasta than there is Coke or Pepsi in the local grocery store aisle.
I call it D: other, aka the Dutch word Frisdrank
Diet Pepsi
Theory: Matpat has donated to cancer research in the past with livestreams because he knows that with the amount of diet coke he is drinking, his chances of cancer are raised.   BUT THATS JUST A THEORY  A "HOPE I WASNT RIGHT" THEORY
in England we say the name of the coke like can i get a pepsi or could i get a dr.pepper.
"DIE"t Coke
Foodlion is carfour in belgum
Matpat drinks ZERO SUGER coke says its not to sugary me NO DUH
So MatPat's a Sans is Ness, red jacket wearing, FNaF theorizing, Diet Coke loving man.
Also you and steph look like brother and sister. Kinda weird
Is steph only with you because of YouTube money? I mean your cool and all but she is waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy out of your league bro
U guys don't have Pepsi Max?
Mat: you guys down there in the south are just chaotic  Me: why thank you
I feel like diet coke has an advantage since yknow, every fountain drink is superior to its bottle / can form.
Cries in curiosity cola ( local brand. goddamn great).
i always forget that people call soda different things in different places but yea, us Floridians call everything coke
Matt and Steph start debating if it's Pop, Soda, or just Coke... I'm listening, but all i'm hearing building to a roaring crescendo in the background is "In The Halls Of The Mountain King"...
Zevia Cola
Your in North Carolina!!! WOW That's so cool
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿M o y a i🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
soda
soda
So Herris Teeter is Just the U.S.A's No Name brand
food lion is a also a delhaize in belgium bro
This is the time when I wish I live in America
I’m soda
as a Filipino idk why we call it Soft Drinks
i'm a soda guy
Here in proxima b we call it hydrogen peroxide
it’s insane that where i live there are absolutely NONE of the kroger stores u mentioned :c
I’m soda lol
There is a new Coke Zero and IT SMACKS. It contains potassium citrate, a type of citric acid. Seems Coke saw this video and adjusted.
Me who’s allergic to citrus acid
Diet Coke has citric acid as well
I'm more of a flavoured sparkling water guy lol
I call it Fizzy drink
i drink nestea iced tea but the sugar free only uses aspertame... fml
If you can find it Try Cockta
Using the fountain version of a soda seems to bend the rules a bit.
b im a soda guy
I feel validated, I die for coke zero... And steph got my back
How bout coke zero? It also has no calories
3:45 turn on captions and watch
I have like two Kroger grocery stores where I live and yes I do think that they infact use the same diet coke there because I hate the taste of name brand diet cola but I love the Kroger brand because it has that fruity sweetness in the back you described, my second place was diet coke with Splenda
Even though I grew up in Indiana I go to trips to North Carolina  I have heard of Food Lion
not pop soda or coke. its fizzy drink
Soda
in my country we call soda "gas" like gassy drink
In UK we call it a fizzy drink :)
Pop
this is late but we have a food lion in Tennessee as well
I mean, for science, the tasters shouldn't have known which two drinks were paring off during a given round. Let someone else control what you drink, to help you stay less biased.  #endrant
I know this isn’t readily available, but the best Diet Coke substitute is 100% the H-E-B Diet Original Cola
I don’t even like Coke, but I really wanna take that Harris Teeter😂
Look I’ve been around the world, okay? Whatever it is, I’ll understand.  *Matpat quitting Diet Coke*  There is nothing about this I understand
New Coke Zero flavor is very goid
3:47 look at the subtitles......👀
D I call them fizzy drinks
I recommend caffeine free Diet Coke I think it taste a little sweeter and just over all a little better
Soft drink/ soda
Soda
I like mountain dew with root beer combined also I don't like diet soda
Next I strongly recommend Harris teeter fresh pizza, it is amazing and it stays that way for days. (to me i think it's at its best cold but whatever)
In Australia we call “pop” fizzies
The middle is the bottle become you can see the bottle
diet coke is no more
Also I'm pop! Yuhhhh midwest
Wait but...did you use any other fountain drinks? Because fountain soda is always superior so that skews things! Should've went can.
I love the soda from food lion
Just drink regular coke       Actually just drink  water
"Here in North Carolina" *points to the middle of the U.S.*
Just realized if Matt lives in North Carolina he lives in the same state as Me. Beast
I am the same obsessed with Dr.Pepper than Mat is with diet coke
Zero sugar Dr Pepper is the best tho👌
im drinking coke while watching this how ironic
Welcome to the south Matthew.
My mom always said fizzy drinks :/
Pop
This is very late, but I’d have to say D. (Referring to what do you call soda) I usually say “Drink” or the name of the soda. When I ask for a soda, instead of saying soda, pop, or coke, I’d say something like “Can I have a sprite?” (I’m from East Fl btw)
Cold drink that's what we called it
I say coke
Here in the UK we just call them by their brand name: so all forms of Coca-Cola are called Coke, all Fanta flavours are just Fanta, etc...
All are Coke
This might be a dumb question but, is cola really a flavor?
Last time King Soopers had soda on sale (four 12-packs for $11, instead of the usual $24), I got the last three packs of Coke Vanilla Zero, but needed a 4th to pad out my order to get the sale price... and I ended up discovering my new favorite: Mtn Dew Major Melon Zero.  Even my partner loves it, and it replaced her long-time favorite too -- Pepsi Blue.
Here in Germany we normally just order "Coke" and you get whatever the restaurant has, which most of the time is Sinalco or Fritz Cola because most restaurants are boycotting Coca-Cola here now since a few years.
Wait he said that he’s only gonna taste cola flavored and then said that Dr Pepper isn’t cola flavored idk but I thought that Dr Pepper was cola flavored
I’m a B:Soda
Pepsi Max all the way
B or C for me
"The north Carolina based store food lion which you've probably never heard of" me a Matt and Ryan supermega fan, you underestimate me
B
Who's going to tell Matt that West Tennessee has food lion as well?
HOW MANY YOUTUBERS LIVE NEAR ME WTF!!!
Food theory: Things I could have bought if I'd discovered Harris Teeters as a teenager.   That price difference has got to add up. 🤔  Also I find it funny to imagine Mat at a restaurant now, 'settling' for Diet Coke. Double edged sword to find awesome diet cola in your local shop, but nowhere you dine will ever serve it. 😵
What about diet fanta
I am a soda pop guy
Wait,wait wait......   you're in NC too?!  How are you not hooked on diet sundrop? Diet Sundrop replaced diet coke for me.  I dropped the cola all together.  When warm i feel i taste bismuth!  Cold cola is still okay.  My wife goes for the coke zero.  She no like the regular diet.
Don't really drink POP but diet pop is disgusting and diet coke is probably the worst of them all. Dr pepper is the only pop necessary
I'd love to add something but its more of a normal coke thing but Senkus coke from Dr.Stone
I live near a harris teeter. Simply some great food there. Great bucher, great sushi chef, its simply great there. Not too expensive either
My only hope, as he has a Publix in his area, the ultimate challenge should be Subway vs Jimmy Johns vs Publix Deli subs.
Pop
I eat pizza every 2 days soooo almost everyday yum
Plot twist: The second soda was actually Diet Coke and no Harry teeter
D
I say both pop and soda
OK as someone who drinks way way too much DIet Coke (roughly 2x 2liters a day). Switch for more than a few mouthfuls, like more than a day even. You will want that good ol' Diet Coke back. I have tried switching to something cheaper. And considering the price per 2 liter keeps going up, I would love a cheaper "Diet Coke".
Bruh, my sister is allergic to citric acid.
everywhere in britain is pop but i like the word soda better
Okay, the Shasta might have been bad, but it’s the taste of my childhood.
You know your from the south when you know all the stores they name and describe
You should try out Virgils Diet Cream Soda! I haven’t tried the diet version, but I’m a huge fan of the other flavors
The music they play at 7:47 is called what?
I cant wait till oliver get old enough to play game with them and try foods with them
i prefer normal coke
I don't really like cola, so I don't know how Kroger's cola is, but they have a Dr. Pepper alternative called Dr. K, which somehow  has a grape-flavor note to it and it gave me really nasty headaches so I don't suggest buying it.
Coke
bruh the jacket is maroon
Rootbeer
15:30 here in Canada most people I know never call it pop or soda  and just go by brand
I can't drive due to seizures, but I'm sending my fiance to Kroger to get dinner and their generic Diet Cola in a few minutes. You sold me, and I actually quit drinking soda in exchange for green tea, but sacrifices shall be made.
I drink mt dew
This is super late but would you be willing to try Inca Kola it is a Peruvian drink that I think in my personal opinion is the best, you can find it in almost any Peruvian or Hispanic market. It is definitely not healthy but it's really good... Edit- I completely forgot there is a diet Inca Kola... I was drinking it right now...
Pop
Wow way to represent NC, Harris Teeter and Food Lion lol! Had no idea you lived there
It’s funny that I was drinking a Diet Pepsi whilst watching this
S O D A
are they that bad
Pop
Pop
22:36 oh hey a Meijer
i dont say coke ,pop or soda . i say carbonated sweetened beverage
speaking of Diet Coke, you should try diet coke in the UK, pretty good
Guessing they denied him a sponsorship
I call it "fizzy drinks" or "drinks with bubbles" But I hate almost all fizzy drinks. The only one I like is crystal clear. The version that comes in plastic bottles. It's basically bubbled water with a lil bit of fruit juice.
Where is pepsi max (I love diet coke, but max beats it any day)
this has to be click bait
11:46
I call it a soft drink
He what! Did he really just say he wants to replace diet coke this is outrageous!
water
You're a mad man, even like 5 years in
I am Canadian so I am a pop man
Boylan’s orange soda is great imo. It’s very similar to orange Fanta.
The upset of Diet Pepsi losing to grocery store diet broke my heart. How could you do this to me Diet Pepsi??? 😭
I went to Harris Teeter and got their Diet Cola when I visited NC because of this video   No regrets here
Ive heard people online say that southerners say coke, but I have literally never heard anyone call soda coke
Diet Shasta cola and diet Faygo cola are the best of my opinion. Diet Coke is nasty but Coke zero is pretty good.
I would like to vouch for boylans other sodas
Big k cola does slap
soda is what i call well.... soda
I juat finished watching this and now ALL my youtube ads are pepsi and coca cola. Nice.
Wait mat is from North Carolina too??
We call it fizzy drink/soft drink in NZ, but there's this one storebrand fizzy you can get in Pak'nsave that is tropical flavoured and is amazing Literally 99 cents and we'll get like 3 bottles to take to family picnics, dinners etc.
I need someone to talk to me the way matt talks about harris teeters diet cola
I am a soft drink #aussie
...          I like Pepsi
Me who likes Stevia:MWAHAHAHAHAHHA
we dont have pick n save we have picnsav
B : Soda🥤
We do we we say, not as we do ~ Hippocrates 🌝
You inspired me to try my own blind cola off for bourbon and Coke. And yes Harris Teeter won that too
The more I watched this episode, the more I wished this video was a GTLive full livestream.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i'm soda
D: im an Australian so its lemonade
Zevia is actually pretty big here in the gta (greater toronto area.) id put it like 7-8th seed
I’ll get flamed for this and I’m not a hippie but kombucha is up there
Enjoy that soda for me, cause I can't have it.
In Australia we call it soft drink
B
dose and would milk taste good in soda  Cola Root beer Orange soad  What would it taste like
Subscribe to Frank Robinson
I also have a soda I can never get away from its Sunkist strawberry lemonade
B. Soda
Hey Mattpat just some input here, due to the changing of tastebuds and/or the amount of diet cola you have consumed and tasted in your life has given your brain a search for that similar yet different taste, like eating mac and cheese constantly or hamburgers, you get tired of it subconsciously whether you think it or not and so im glad youve found something new, it reopens that creativity aspect of your brain
I'm B soda
"After 6 consecutive rock paper scissors draws..." Yep, that's married life.
"Florida is part of the southeast of the US." Are you sure about that? Cause its like a different world down here.
He used 7th seed thrice
elon musk payed him to promote his secretly founded coke brand!!!!!!
i grew up in the midwest saying pop, then randomly in middle school i started saying soda more, now i am starting to say pop again lol
I’m with Steph, I switched to Coke Zero from Diet Coke awhile back
Man they are perfect for each other
That rock paper scissors moment was fucking trippy
Mountain Dew Baja Blast is the best
The fact that he can differentiate between can and bottle when they aren't in those containers is impressive. I always assumed the different flavor was from my mouth touch metal versus plastic.
Other: i say cold drink
Steph: you can't have half the brackets being diet coke  Half of the actual brackets being diet Pepsi
It’s pop
I'm glad boylan bottleing co. was in this, but thats their worst soda though.
shouldve tried LA ice cola
I a pop person I have never called it soda
im north and we say it coke
im north and we say it coke
Did they use the same cups or change them every round
ah Nane
Me: *sees this video* Also me: "wait that's illegal"
In England it's mainly fizzy not soda
People who don't live in America are fjucking angry
I actually call soda drink normally bc I don't consider water a drink I consider it water
Im going on a sugar free diet and matt decided  to torture Me
D: Fizz
I call it coke
Funny how he says that we have never heard of food lion when Mr. Beast bought the store out in one video...
I had the e Same reaction as steph
Old people: it’s called pop Younger people: it’s called soda Southerners: it’s just coke Me: it’s called gone in three seconds
lel, im shocked that matpat liked something that isnt diet coke better than diet coke qwq
Coke zero is my favorite soda
B.
"Faxe kondi", It's the best soda ever... I WILL NOT BE SILENCED!!!
I was rooting for a Pepsi product and then Diet Pepsi got immediately eliminated and the two other Pepsi products fought each other and the winner fought Diet Coke wow mat thanks for absolutely dunking on Pepsi
Soda
I was at Fred Meyer today and bought Big K Diet Cola. Letting it chill overnight in the fridge and giving it a taste tomorrow.
Jaritos
Mexican coke is the true champ. 👑
I have known that Diet Coke was dangerous for years why did you even start Coca-Cola is just bad for you
" store which you've probably never heard of,Food Lion" Me who has lived in VA all my life- " haha yeah.. also totally didnt know cook out or publix existed and wasnt at all shocked to see you have to explain what they were"
When u realize how mat and Steph had a child "you ruined my childhood in the worst way posible"
Or March mammal madness that some school science classes do like mine
Food Lion isn't just in North Carolina, our town's grocery store (West Virginia) happens to be Food Lion too and honestly.. After trying so many colas from Coke, Pepsi, Shasta etc, Food Lion makes the best cola I've ever had. For me it's got the perfect mix of Coke's "bite and the burn" and Pepsi's sweetness which makes it fantastic.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why matpat
Everything is coke (can you tell i am from the south)
But MatPat! Have you had CHEERWINE!?
Matpat has good editing skills, I think he should be a youtuber
i wanna talk about how   steph tould mat give it to me 20:24
Round 2: - Diet Coke (fountain) - SodaStream - Diet Pepsi - Pepsi Zero Sugar - Coke Zero -  Diet Sam's Cola - Haris Teeter Diet Cola - Food Lion Round 3: - Coke Zero - Diet Coke - Diet Pepsi Caffeine Free - Harris Teeter Diet Cola Round 4:  - Diet Coke - Coke Zero - Harris Teeter Diet Cola Round 5: (Matthew) 1st: Harris Teeter Diet Cola 2nd: Diet Coke 3d: Coke Zero (Steffanni) 1st: Coke Zero 2nd: Diet Coke 3d: Harris Teeter Diet Cola
matpat: cola with additional taste is not allowed. also matpat: lets harris teeter with its citrus taste in the tournament and lets it win
Bro we have food lions in South Carolina but cool vid
Coke and Pepsi taste the same
Its been 4 months think he full back into the sweet sweet acidic kiss of coke
Hey can you do a video on zero calories power aid or Gatorade drinks.
Omg i live really close to matt pat wow
Say sike right now
brits call them fissy drinks
One crucial fact that Mat never mentioned was the temperature of these sodas.   In the very first test of Diet Coke: can/bottle/fountain, Mat says fountain has most carbonation. We all know that colder drinks can store more CO2, and that a fountain would come served cold.  What if the canned and bottled Diet Coke were taken off the room temp shelves? What if half these other drinks were room temp too?
I live in Texas we say Coke or we ask if you want a Dr Pepper
So glad to see my baby, Coke Zero, make it to top three.
(Can we talk about whether or not Diet Coke is actually healthier?)
Mat: No spin-offs on the Diet Cola format Also Mat: I like this one best. It tastes like citrus.
Pop
Tell us how to keep our teeth perfect like yours
Brisk iced tea!!!
Diet Coke is so nasty 🤢
You can tell Matt and Steph are a good match because of that mega stalemate rock paper scissors
Theres no way its been 4 months already thats when i decided to claim the throne of diet drinks. I had 4 cans of diet pepper a day then died down but still drank large size cups of it. I havent had any for 1 month. Will keep updated for the 1.3 people that care :P
"Brand Loyalty" is just a euphamism for brain washing,
so the thing about stevia is, that when you first/don't really consume it that much, your tastebuds aren't ready for the sweetness, cause it registers as like 1000x more sweet than sugar or something, but if you consume it regularly, your body/tastebuds adapt, and it becomes very pleasant, and since switching to zevia, I haven't really had a regular type soda in like 5 years.
Do you really live in North Carolina if so I'm so happy cause that's like 2 or 3 of my favorite youtuber is who live in North Carolina
Why did I think they lived in California?
As in North Carolina hearing you probably never heard of food Lion really shocked me
1 problem.. thats y u have a palet cleanser to not know exactly which is which by the end finals
We kinda just call it coke
But what if I don’t like cola
a
lmao my dad always told me that the only different between no-name and brand products is the packing and name. That it is litterally made in the same factory and honestly that always made total sense to me and I never questioned the dinamics of it.
A AND B
I used to call soda/pop/etc “SAUSAGE”
I say soda and coke but usually soda because i worry that people might think I’m asking for a none soda product
I love zevia
My favorite soda is Jean Lafitte Ginger Ale by Swamp Pop
I feel like an honerary member after he said food 4 less, us poor people go there and the coke is good
I’m a Matthew to

Unpopular opinion: Coke Zero is better than Diet Coke.

stars and stripes!
I am pop
i say  pop    i call them by name   sorry a n w root beer is better then eany coke or pepsie  but  meny mt dews i like     try dif  mt dews and rootbeers
Pop
I can confirm that boylans other products such as their root beer are amazing
Why did i think matpat lived in California?
My favorite drink is weirdly water even tho it doesn't taste like anything it's still delicious and when it's cold I drink all of it or half
I’m an other but I really don’t know what the uk calls it
Diet Dr Pepper is the best diet drink Dr Pepper is the best normal one
There’s also but that’s just a theory A GAME THEORY
...yeah where I live we call it soft drink; not really sure why it's not particularly 'soft.' Also I've only ever drunk Pepsi max. No questions are not accepted.
We used to have Food Lion in Texas, but they closed in the early aughts
How does anyone think artificial sweeteners are sweet? ... They're always so incredibly bitter. Diet coke and any diet soda is undrinkably bitter. If you want soda, drink soda. Not a lot of soda... but yeah diet soda is superfluous.  Artificial sweeteners are NOT sweet. Stevia is acidly bitter. Splenda is just bitter. Aspartame is a bit like floor cleaner.  My area has no Publix, never been too one.  Closest is 31 Miles away. I have never been to a Harris Teeter.  We DO have a Food Lion. It's just soda, no one calls all soda coke. I live in North Carolina.
I think matpatt should try a internacional one...and seleção "guaraná kuat" on those
Other: in iraq every single soda is called or drink or bebsi i know its pepsi but arabs man
15:26 ok in My country we say or i say Läsk
you should try some dr. perky from food lion
Well he got really impressed then
im pop
Mellon soda.
I'm a pop guy
I don't like stevia but my favorit cola is flavored with stevia. It's wierd for some reason it doesn't have that wierd taste.
I don't drink much soda, and I don't drink diet. when coke made their racial comment I said I'm not the right color for coke and looked for a replacement. I found " R C  cola " which I had forgotten about. you don't see it every ware so I suspect that's why you didn't have it in your match off. I'm on the east coast and only 2 stats from you so I think you just didn't happen to go to a store that stocked it. you might want to try to find some near you, I think you might like it. just an FYI have a good one and keep up the good job.
Thank god its not me i really really hate the stevia "fake" sweetner it has such a rank taste and after taste that i call it a poison taste
Next thing we know it  Matpat is probably gonna drink diet Pepsi
Meanwhile I’m sitting here with my Dr Pepper zero sugar…
In Texas its like. Server What coke do you want. Me. Dr pepper
Here's a tip: drink only water/fruits juice. You won't regret it.
But why diet soda? Diet soda is bad to begin with. If you're going to drink a soda, you're better off with the real thing.
Fun fact: Coca Cola is orange flavored, and doctor pepper us cherry
I've always said soda pop.
The audacity
Welcome to sima
Want sushi with some special fish Stephanie?
Disgusting
So fake

Scared?
Wow Very informative deep content Just as usual Much work and respect
I changed my mind. You two are getting killed. Get in line
Grew up in the Northeast, "Soda" all the way.
I don't understand why you like diet soda
Fountain vs all others was poor experimental variable
Is "Pepsi Max" not sold in the US?
Ex kroger employee and yeah they do. Big k is exactly the same as the harris teeter, and is the most popular diet product that isn't name brand
Why dose Stef look like my French teacher?
In Guatemala we say "coca" (coke) or "gaseosa" (carbonated). I prefer Diet Pepsi (the gray one) but is easier to buy Pepsi Zero, is the one fast food offer and it's in different presentations not only can.
what I have a food loin near my house in Maryland
does anyone notice matpats big toungeeee
I wonder if MatPat thinks about this video every time he drinks a diet coke.
but has he ever tried TAB? The Coca-Cola's precursor to diet-coke?
Lol, just drink water
In Scotland all drinks are juice, soda is fizzy juice, squash is diluting juice and normal juice is fruit juice
Well now I have to try Kroger brand soda again I didnt like it last time but that was a good few years ago and I trust the word of a fellow Diet Coka addict
fun fact: food lion is actually called Delhaize.   Don't believe me? Search it up.
Yeah I worked at a jelly factory that made like 20 different jams & jellys. Some did have a couple different ingredients but it was pretty much all the same🤷🏾‍♂️
God bless everyone Jesus loves u
Hands up if majority of this video you aren’t even looking at matpat but staring at stephanie
Typical exchange seemingly everytime I go to a new restaurant. What can I get you to drink? Coke. Pepsi? Water.
Here we call it fizz
22:38 When Matpat goes on describing Harris Teeter at the end, I just imagined that scene from How I Met Your Mother when Marshall describes the perfect burger HAHAHA
I'm B and C
The skillful pet concretely squash because icicle diagnostically tug before a drunk increase. nonchalant, aloof tiger
Pop > Soda
Here we don't call it Pop, Soda or Coke. We just call it soft drink because that's better than using some weird name
In Australia we call it fizzy drink or soft drink
18:03 Matpat says 13th seeded but it says 10th seeded
Soda from Alabama.
d
Personally, I still say Soda, BUT my friend and I argued about this once and he presented a good final argument that I accepted "Pop" as the appropriate term. They used to be called "Soda Pop" having both in there, and grammatically, Soda is an adjective there where Pop is the noun, so pop is more correct.
Mat pat who doesn’t know food lion
14:53  Uh… Matt you know that Pepsi was made in NC🤣
I can vouch for boylans other sodas, they make the best cream soda ive ever had
Please make a video about aspartame
I just make my own soda at home. It's literally extremely easy. Sprite for example is just lemon, lime, sugar and citric acid combined into a syrup. Suddenly you have like 10-20 liters of sprite at home.
I can’t believe you put that sludge in your body!
Born and raised in Louisiana, never refered to soda as just "coke" when asking what someone wanted to drink
In Australia we call it soft drink or fizzy
this came out on my birthday!
me who like shasta
Don't drink diet soda. The ones with aspartame especially. It's a chemical waste product that happens to taste sweet. But it's so bad for you.
soda
Literally like almost all diet colas have citric acid in it and most sodas in general
We have Harris teeters in Virginia to.
I used to like Diet Coke but since I was basically raised on it I have grown to despise it
15:28 gotta say I think imma go with d I call it drink
If I had a nickel for every youtubes I know drink alot a lot of coke and asks for a sponsor from them I wound have 2 nickel which is not alot but its weird there's 2 mapat &jacksepticeye
Didn’t mr beast buy like half a food lion?
The thing with stevia is that it's a 1 to 2 parts with sugar. It tends to be sweeter and has an aftertaste that most aren't used to. Like with coke or pepsi, I get a bad aftertaste. So either way there'll be an aftertaste, it just depends on what you want and what you like. :)
I’m fizzy drink
Where I am from is Sody Pop
Cough, cough. Food lion is also in Virginia😑😑😑😑
This would've been better if you did it where you dont know what your drinking until the end

I also feel that you and your wife should have done separate rounds because in some cases she seemed to completely skew / Influence your opinion. Some of it was confusing editing where it seemed like you were saying “that was pleasant” and she said “no it wasn’t” meanwhile you were talking about different drinks. I don’t personally think you could beat a 16 cup blind taste test and would LOVE to see you prove me wrong! But having her opinion there influenced your judgment sometimes, it was written on your face and sometimes words. Do a RANDOM short live 16 cup blind taste test where it’s impossible for you to know which cup it’s in , I’ll turn on notifications for that alone !
I’m just on the “play in games” section and choosing fountain diet cola as a source really isn’t a good idea … unless you can control EVERY possible variable? Do you have you’re own soda tap in your house that is connected to diet cola syrup and you can be sure that it is full ? That the carbonator (co2 container) is also full? And that the water to syrup mix is exactly the same across the board because you personally set it? The issue with fountain cola is the machine , some places (usually fast food and franchise chains) use more water (by a bit) and less syrup , there is a suggested measurement and then there is their measurement ; each location is different and every cup could be different depending on how much syrup is left in the bag in a box and what % mixture they use. Also you would have to realize that fountain soda loses its flavor and co2 quicker then bottles would and you can always open a fresh can but to use fountain you would have to continuously grab a fountain and drink it within mins to be sure it’s getting a fair chance. I wouldn’t have personally used fountain but used can vs bottle to be sure that the fountain wasn’t the choice solely because whoever you got it from that time had a slightly higher syrup to co2 mixture. Cans and bottles are made the same way every time and while I agree the taste is clearly different (I prefer canned ) fountain is too uncontrollable and could be eliminated solely because it’s flavor is weakened not because the other soda was better. Now if you have a soda tap with Diet Coke in you’re house (which is very possible! ) Then it was fine that you used it in the running. But hey, that’s just an assessment! My assessment!
Pop and soda.
B-but wheres the Sunkist 🥲
I can’t believe this guy inspired me to make videos
Y’all I just drink whatever diet soda that’s the cheapest where I’m shopping. Normally it’s diet dr thunder or diet Sam’s cola lol.
Sadly a lot of people take a pass on store brands. Kroger had a real sugar line that had my favorite cola and Dr pepper sodas. That line died off during the pandemic when stores and brands streamlined to just the top sellers.

I'd suggest trying shastras raspberry cream soda
This is the best sporting event I’ve ever seen.
Just playing with the Clips option I noticed: https://youtube.com/clip/Ugz91HJZbXGmnRmm9QB4AaABCQ
Dude, get yourself on apple tango
I dont know why but when I was little my family called soda “special drinks”
14:04 Matt double killed those pillows XD
In our country we just call it "drink"
I believe that the decision to use fountain diet coke as a playin is unreasonable. Since you will not be able to drink fountain diet coke at home, this is very weird
Also loves ruining our childhoods
Wait y’all don’t know about food lion
def soda
Col -100
The Not A Flamethrower🤣
I’m going to have to do a bit of research to figure out where to get this new fave.
I say soda. But, just saying Pop  sounds better to say.
lol gross
Kroger's products are pretty uniform across the board. This summer I was up in Oregon and I went to get groceries from Fred Meyer, and it was the exact same types of foods (flavor, texture, and type) as my local Kroger-run store. Even the banners and labels were the same down to the font and colors that they used.
I my country in brazil we say refrigerante
All
I’m a soft drink guy I’m Australian
Pepsi Max is S level
Drinked this while watching junk coke
He lives a lot closer to me then I thought
Coke is my preferred slang
Pop.....
Food lion is a east coast chain
I’ve had boylan cola before and that is 100% my reaction
Coke for ever y’all
RIP diet coke.
King Soopers once had Huckleberry handcrafted soda under Private Selects. I loved the flavor. They stopped carrying the brand in my area. :( not sure why.... maybe it was because hard liquor was allowed to be sold in their store in my area.
we call it soft drinks
that what being married gets u
Wow!!  Amazing!,    I wish a HTWas here in MO!!  Great video dude!!
Shasta is the drink I've been offered every time I have had to stay in a hospital.
Aspartame is one of the most well tested artificial sweeteners in the world, with over 200 studies on it's safety and only one poorly conducted Italian study has linked it to cancer. The data and results from the study are heavily disputed. It's an urban legend.
The lethal dictionary aesthetically twist because riverbed informally doubt worth a waggish appeal. therapeutic, simple ghana
Finally you stop drinking that liquid poison drink normal Pepsi and Coke
We have quite a few food lions in Maryland
Root beer
Other we call it soft drink
I do some of my grocery shopping at Fred Meyer, I'll check out their "Diet Coke" next time I'm there.
Hearing “let’s get pouring friends” sounded like something a lot less brand safe and now I’m uncomfortable
I’m from the south as well and I call it soda but many around here in SC call it coke
Its sodaaa
You should try Ninja Melk too,
b
Y’all’re cute
I work at a food lion and It’s ok
There is a cola drink in Utah that is called cola and that’s it
who said tonic?
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I FELT SO BETRAYED WHEN HE PICKED THE SECOND CUP AT THE END
I'm a bit late but you might want to try Pepsi max cherry as it has the same flavour as Harris teeter soda but better in my opinion
Dr pepper superiority
Why doesnt mat just have regular coke
I feel like half this video is just Stephanie  silently judging MatPat's unending obsession  with carbonated diet beverages.
1: it’s pop for me 2: I grew up in SC and loved going to food lion but now I’m in Kentucky and don’t see any and that makes me sad 3: PEOPLE HAVENT HEARD OF FOOD LION?!?!
i am dissapointed
Ok, but barrs cola is class.
Food lion is in Maryland too I always shop there I went to North Carolina last week it was fun
I've always said "fizzy drink" lmao
In my house it is pop
I’m a soda person but my partner dislikes that I call it soda and not pop🤣 then I start pulling out calling it all coke
The Drink Theorists
Bit late for the survey, I'm D) something else, 'cause I'm not english.. but I'd say either soft drink or soda.. though I don't recall ever needing to actually say it out loud so.. who knows
Boylan's cough syrup flavor is part of why other companies changed their recipes over time.. that tastes like it did a 100 years ago, which is not the taste people are looking for nowadays haha
i’ve located my pacific northwest fred meyer equivalent to the harris teeter cola and now i’m VERY curious, the ingredient list and nutrition facts are the exact same so… we’ll see
Holy 💩 I had no idea Shasta is known in the SE region of the US!! 😳 I thought it was a signature SW soda. Wow! 🤯
Oh Diet Coke, rest in peace
2:22 Call it "Soda Scramble"
Citric acid is the secret ingredient in the Krabby Patty
I grew up in the midwest, I’m a soda type of gal.
All of the above
00:35  "Its my dream episode." me: more like epiSODA
Lidl have great store brand fizzy drinks in the UK
What about coke not Diet Coke
I am a very heavy Diet Coke drinker I am intrigued
Make a Food Theory about Alcohol, beer and daily wine consumption.
OTHER: soft drink
wow even in our country every thing is coke lol we have say wut coke we want
My favorite coke is Dr Pepper.
Matpats bizzare adventure
the chosen one has fallen i am almost crying
Cherry Diet Coke just tastes the same but without carbonation
3:45...check the subtitles matpat
I just realized how similar matpat is to Willy wonka
I say soda. I has actually went to a fast food "A&W".
im pop
Dang I love Diet Coke though
cherry coke
I want you to know the food lion is called the delhaize in belgium (sorry if i spelled it wrong)
I've always liked Owens cherry cola. I've probably had the regular cola. Ive always preferred Pepsi over coke.
I swear to god if diet Dr Pepper wins at least 1 battle I will jump out of the window
B
he defeated his addiction with another addiction
Oh no thanks I like Pepsi
My family always buys Kroger brand soda 😅. And it's pretty good. (Our Kroger is Fred Meyer)
I just learned matpat and I live in the same state.
We just say drink and say it specifically
I know about food lion because I live in north Carolina
biggest upset of the year
3:45 *when you watch with captions on*
i have both harris and food lion near me lol idk the soda is meh
When I worked at a Ruler Food’s grocery store I quickly learned that Kroger owns and operates all these different stores with different names. I’m not much of a soda drinker myself but I’m half tempted to try this precious diet one from my local Kroger affiliate store.
I can’t believe I just watched a video of Brandon Flowers and Famke Janssen testing out diet soda. What a world we live in.
Funny enough, I did also quit soda in all of 2020
To answer that question, I grew up in Texas and we always just called it soda or coke, but we were well aware that Yankees and Midwesterners called it pop.
It shockens me, a south eastern native, that other people in the states haven't heard of food lion and Harris Teeter
I call the sodas coke in the south in Texas parts
Hopefully u see this not going to lie fetch is amazing i been using it sense 2019 yes it does take a lot of time to buy stuff but amazing app still using in in 2021
And he never even got his Diet Coke sponsor before leaving
I’m a Coke 0 guy
Diet conk ?
Hey MatPat have you tried coke from a glass bottle, we Norwegians swear that the cola from the glass bottles are better than those from plastic bottles and on par with the cans or possibly better.
only one that calls it sodiepop?
Food Lion is actually not only North Carolinian, as its also in Tennessee, Georgia, and some other states
Mlv ner wen
Some say they are still rock paper scissoring to this day
Me who got his Diet Coke addiction at age 14 wanting to be like Matt and ending up drinking it’s religiously: 🥺
Says "cola flavor", shows pepsi.
Would the old matpat would have known he would make a food theory making channel which cancels his favourite drink.
Steph is correct; I too grew up in Georgia and Coke was the generic term for all colas. But I grew up in an earlier era than you guys, we also used the term "Co'Cola". Other interesting facts from my era; It was common to feed your baby Coke in their bottle, also in our elementary school we had a Coke machine and every afternoon we had a Coke break where, as a class we would each put our dime in the machine, a Coke cup would drop down, it would then be filled with ice and Coke then we'd take it back to our seat to drink. I think the teachers liked having us drink Coke because it kept us awake after lunch.  In my early 20's I switched to Diet Coke and 50+ years later still only drink Diet Coke. However, last year I did switch to Sodastream due to the convenience but I purchased a 20 lb. CO2 cylinder and an adapter. Now I only pay $30 to fill/refill with food grade CO2 and it lasts a full year and I fill 18 bottles every 2 weeks.  Interesting fact: Sodastream is a subsidiary of PepsiCo and is based in Israel. So when I make my diet cola at their suggested syrup concentration it has a similarly sweet taste of Diet Pepsi which I don't like, therefore I decrease the syrup to give it more of a Diet Coke taste.
you missed nuka-cola
DD deee
Irn bru is the best soft drink you can't change my mind
We had a food lion in ga. 😌
This is history
Never knew this day would come BECAUSE I know how much you wanted it to sponsor you
Even as a southerner, born and raised in Texas, I’ve always called it “soda”. But, I do distinguish the soda colors. I’ll say “I want a dark soda” or a “clear soda” as generalizing terms.
Harsis teeter is kinda not alowed to be in the vid bc matpat said only soda flavour is alowed but haris teeter was explained to have a fruity taste sooooo do whatever you want mat pat
Zevia is the best!! We put it down like you do . 🥤🥤🥤
b
Fun fact: matpat should be called eduardpat Because he loovvveesss diet coat
I can’t imagine drinking that much cola considering i swear to god it makes me sick.
You guys call Delhaize Food Lion in America??????
3:46 the captions...
I like Diet Pepsi more.
Stevia is one of the fake sugar substitutes that dont have too good of a start and a horrible after-taste
Diet coke is so fucking disgusting how do people even like it😂
When you get a Diet Coke add😲😲😲😲😲😲
Heeeey, Food Lion is in my dads town in PA
Soda at least that's what my parents would ask for I personally don't like soda I just the carbonation just tastes very sour to me and it don't like it
Ok, i grew up in the midwest, it ain’t pop, its soda
honestly had no idea harris teeter was local to NC, but I think I can speak for all north carolinians when I say that harris teeter is closest to my house as well   edit: FOOD LION TOO! this should not suprise me but it does
im um fizzles, just me
E : all of the above
My dad calls it tonic, he’s from Boston. My mom Pop from Ohio and I call it soda from NH lol
i am team "cocahina"    just kidding ,im team coke

For the what do you call it question I chose D, here in Australia we call it fizzie drink
I love diet irn bru

Soda 🥤
In India soda is generally called soft drink. I dont know why , it just is.
I say soft drink..
*You had been mark by death, traitor.* ~Coke Brother.
There is Pack n Save in New Zealand! I'm going to have a look next time I go shopping there and, I'll report/post the ingredients here of there off brand coke if you would like me to. @foodtheory
Next theory : What's the optimal choice in rock paper scissors
I find it funny that on some colas Matt was jus full on gagging and Steph had more of a I don’t know if I like this and was a little more polite ( no offence Matt I didn’t mean to say you’re impolite)
13th seed v the 3rd uh okay i guess
A. Pop
Harris Teeter Cola Sales bouta go 📈📈📈📈
Stevia may not be the most amazing soda sweetener, but it works very well as a coffee sweetener. That said, I prefer Stevia Cane, which is a 50/50 mix of Stevia and cane sugar, which is much healthier.
I call cola like coke just cuz my friends get confused with it and the drug
So. Here’s the thing. Diet soda is actually *worse* for you than regular soda. Also. The best soda is Dr. Pepper. It is *ALWAYS* Dr. Pepper.
These 2 are just soooo cute.... Holy heck... I hope the rock paper scissors thing wasn't scripted.
yeah but coke zero is great
I'm a Michigander it's pop
I call it pop or soda
Soda pop
Dude my theory is because mattpat gave up diet coke 2020 was a very bad year (I'm joking don't blame mattpat)
MatPat has the best voice ever
A POP POP
diet pepsi Is my diet coke
18:03 Harris Teeter Diet Cola: 15th seed Mattpatt saying the seed for Harris Teeter Diet Cola: 13th seed What's written in the video for Harris Teeter Diet Cola: 10th seed *Something's wrong, I can feel it*
Stevia is much better for iced teas. You should try Zevia’s teas. I like the non caffeinated ones, passion fruit and lemon. But there’s tons of other flavors. They are the best.
Goote fuute for you :O
For the boylan and johny Ryan soda it tastes horrible if you leave it unsealed for a while you should try it again but strait out the bottle
Other: Redbull
I’m allergic to aspiration and don’t like diet drinks I bring disrpect
In the UK most of us tend to call a fizzy drink as just a "Drink" for some unknown reason
Hello internet  welcome to food theory : classic matpat
soda
1:21 Diet hard with a vengeance
I'm sorry but the fact that you didn't choose coke zero will never sit right with me
To be devil's advocate, Harris Teeter did somewhat cheat by adding citric acid. While it is not in it of itself a fruit extract, it definitely gives foods a fruity tang to them, which was a bar on this list. That being said, I am shocked that Harris Teeter won, especially since they weren't meant to compete in the first place lmao
Matpat
Oh yeah this, surprised Mtn. Dew Cola wasn't in it.
Sometimes I say soda but most of the time I say pop. Midwest gang!!
nice video
soda
Coke
Food lion is also in TN
🥤
You should have Pepsi
My mom's allergic to citric acid
No Faygo how do juggalos live there
I love Cherry Coke
Do I like soda at all…. Nope  Did I watch this entire thing…. Yes
Imagine if he tried the coke that’s in Mexico south America and Asia with the glass bottles and real sugar he would break its way better definitely not diet though
Haha definitely have been to Food Lion, but it is definitely funny to think a good chunk of the US definitely hasn't heard of them.  Also never realized ya'll were NC residents. For some reason I thought you were in California.
I’m with steph: Coke Zero all the way!
14:37 Matpat: You’ve probably never heard of Food Lion My family: *Goes to Food Lion every other day*
Great. Now quit YouTube.
In sis we call it soft drinks
I actually did that "what do you call carbonated beverage survey" for school with those exact choices
zero calories is impossible, do not fall in trap!!!
So uh, I have been rewatching lots of Food Theory episodes and this is one of them. And something came into my mind when watching them consuming excessive amounts of diet colas. In my culture, when we caught a cold, we do have a home remedy where we boil the cola, add ginger and lemons to it and surprisingly it help alot when I caught colds, and is a recipe that I kept using till this day. I do recall cola used to have "medical" qualities back in the day, and I was wondering if this is food theory worthy.
We call it cola
Nobody in a million years would have thought he could give it up but the madlad did it
Coca-Cola Zero has been my go two for the past three years. Easy winner over any diet colas I tried.
U in nc
Not gonna lie, the use if Zero from Megaman and borderlands got me. That was great  Also, I'm an other. I say: Carbonated drink, or bubble infused liquid
Have y seen  the honest coke commerical on YouTube?
Stephanie (while in North Carolina)- “Down here in the south”   Me laughing in Florida man
This was weirdly wholesome. Matt and Steph's tastes overlapped in a really fun way, and they even have the same reaction to a lot of the drinks. "Oooh..." "Oh geez..." and just silent, furrowed brows.
Have you tried Virgil's root beer?  Yes, they have a diet version.  Since I know you're into that sort of thing.
Wait. What in the friggen frick?
Quick Question: Does MatPat love Diet Coke more then he does Stephanie?
1 nerd 1 citris adict
I respect Matts opinion but come on everyone knows cans are better
everyone: pop, soda,coke  me: It's a fizzy drink. I call coke, coke 7 up, 7 up and so on
I was with you until you said diet Pepsi taste better than anything that stuff is toilet water with aspertame.
cola=/=soda the cola is cola but the soda is water with hydrogen if i remember right
Fanta is my favorite drink
Nothing better than an ice cold pepsi
I’m from Ireland so is fountain Diet Coke like if you got a cup of coke from subway?
So i am doomed because i am in South Africa
If you want to quit coke go for beer
Alternate title: MatPat and Stephanie acting like they're on dгugs for 24 minutes 31 seconds straigt
The frame rate is high one this vid
Us down here in Australia call it "Soft Drink", not any of what you call it.
I My dad would call soda carbonated water with flavour and sugar
Why is called Pepsi zero sugar, in the UK anyway it's called Pepsi Max. Zero sugar (and calories) Max flavour
I live in Britain which means I guess I'll have to stick with coke zero.
Next episode: And this episode was sponsored by Harris Teeter
Wait what food lion isnt nation wide???!!!
Pop, I’m from Minnesota it’s a stereotype from use to say pop
How dare you disrespect publix
soda
This just shows you that the top dog doesn't always win, and the last pick can make a difference
9:40
Uhhh what state doesn't have a food lion🤔
The fact that I just now realized this was published on my birthday, and that that was the day that i decided that diet coke is nasty
You guys drink diet coke? Yuck.
In Australia we call it soft drink
12:54 I have NEVER heard someone actually say "harris teeter" I have only heard people calling it "teeter jeeters" oh my god that sounds so weird now
im sad you didnt choose your original
try ZEVIA OTHER FLAVORS
I’m so proud of you Harris Teater and Food Lion. Here in VA those are the two biggest stores near me.
Where I live it called soft drink
now cola bites thier own asses because they never sponsored mat!!! serves you right multi million dollar companie!!!
D. Other, soft drinks or fizzy drinks...
You live in North Carolina. I thought you lived in LA. Like boujjii LA
I call it läsk
My soda of choice is soda stream because it’s dirt cheap
Soft drink or soda
moral of the story: home brand cola is better than big brand cola
OH MY MG I CA'NT BELEEIF YUO DIT TIS MATT PAT IM UN SUPCRIBEING FRO MYOU 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Let me explain the flavor *sips*, not good (after the 11:30 mark)
I’m glad for the boyland soda representation, one of my favorite companies
So harris teeter is the jaida essence hall of diet colas
All those Kroger-owned markets and STILL none are here in Maine. :( I'll just have to do my own New England "soda" taste test sometime. You know, for science. Wait, I hardly drink soda, lol!
You don't advocate drinking lots of diet coke, but what about sugary soda.
MatPat really was going to replace the 1st love of his life
I don’t care about the rules, vanilla coke is the only soda
Can you pls do a bracket on the kroger owned stores and tell me the store with the same
Them store brand Southern foods are really something man.  I may have to experiment with this a bit here in Georgia.  My problem with diet colas is the aspartame un many of them. Not messing with that stuff!
I’m sorry if this seems rude but I really thought this would be fun and educational  like most theorist videos, but instead it was just both of them trying out witch liquid poop is better than the other
I am (c) coke
C. Coke

I was partial to RC Cola when I used to drink soda.
Don’t put industrial goo in your body!
Quit all Coke. Bad for you and somehow owned by people who virtue signal. Ah yes act like the good guys as you ruin lives with your unhealthy addictive drink  corporation, enjoy your kidney stones and other health problems you cause COKE. Bet all those underpaid workers like you sooo much, bet you love picking those poor countries to do all the work for you, bet they've been doing slavery stuff with the CCP, also creating racial hate and other disgusting grifting like methods  Imagine supporting CocaCola.
soda
NEXT TIME TRY POISONS BYE
I tried the Harris teeter one and yea it's amazing
I’m just glad my Coke Zero did as good as it did, that’s my champ
Immediately after finishing this video I drove 5 minutes down the road to Kroger and bought their diet cola. I am now impatiently waiting for it to get cold.
Boyland cream soda is so good but the cola is disgusting.
It's not soda or pop it's soda pop

Ima "Soda" Guy. I've always haved, and always will, call it soda. If I want to joke to my parents I'll ask for a Soda pop. My mom just looks at me funny when I do.🤣
down here in Australia we just call it fizzy drink
yo wheres the diet RC
all americans have a very feminine accent
My fav is Coke Zero
This is how my family pronounces soda ( we are not from an English speaking country) we say Pepsi or we just say the soda's name 😅😀
B: soda for sure
Was definitely for the best, they add stuff in the diet ones to make up for the lack of sugar. Which can cause cancer way down the road if you have enough of it. That's what I've been told tho
Lier you drank diet coke on October 1st 2020
D: other (water)
I’m curious, did anyone else’s family call soda “soft drinks”? Because mine did and I don’t want to be an oddball...
Pepsi is far better than coke. Not gonna lie. Coke has like a salty flavor and Pepsi is more sweet. It just tastes better
b
Take away the context  of soda  and this sounds like the plot to a sports movie
If you have a Lidl by you try “Freeway” it’s in all Lidl’ globally and it comes as cola, diet, zero sugar, and orange flavours. It’s a grate substitute as I only tasted a small difference, its cheaper than well known brands. I would definitely put it in a global or regional mashup similar too this.
Dr. Pepper is a drink I consume at gallon, thank you free refills. Thank you.
Food Lion is just OG Hannafords

Why does she vaguely remind me of Ana Kendrick?
Diet Coke is worse than normal Coca-Cola because it’s flavored in a chemical way which is worse in health.
D: Other In Australia, I grew up calling it "Soft Drink"
"I thought this was the only thing you could get out of a specialty thing" Haris Teeter: And where did that bring you? Haris Teeter: *Back to me.*

In my country Jordan soda or coke is universally called “bibzi”
so its one addiction to another
I only drink diet when I drink alcohol to get drunk faster
I went to one of the only Harris Teeters in my state while on vacation just because of this video
No you haven't
Us Australians call soda, soft drink, don't ask me why, because I don't know
You should mack another one but whith the normal one's my favourite is fanta
Where was this filmed another universe
We in México call it refresco and some nort state's soda

Coke, what? My favourite Coke is Pepsi.
I live in the south, so I find it immensely hilarious how you have no idea about Harris Teeter, Publix, or Food Lion
I thought food lion was everywhere
Living in the Midwest United States I call it soda
MatPats new dose of the good stuff
9:24 crystal Pepsi was a 90’s thing
You should not know the brands were when testing them!  FAIL
I love how steph says "that red jacket" like if its not right there
Harris Teeter REPRESENT!!! I bought it just because I needed a mixer and it was cheap (seriously, it was just like 79 cents for a two liter) and it ended up becoming my soda of choice.
My dog's name is Shasta (after the cream soda) and she kept coming over to see who was calling her. I thought that was cute.
Quitting drinking the soda produced by that racist company ay? Good on you matpat.
the filler slot, the one that they got because they had no other choice because they couldnt find what they were looking for, just came outta nowhere and MURDERED the competition, even down to dethroning 2 coke products at the same time. I need to find this drink and try it at leas ONCE even though I hate diet soda.
You should really try Gassosa AVENA Effeeeeeesssssss
Big K, you might like it
i feel like people like me who live in north carolina didnt know harris teeter and food lion were only local supermarkets and not national
have to say I'm A
But why diet? Is worse for you then just regular coke.
I grew up in Atlanta, I say soda and everyone around me called it soda. We only said coke when we’re referring to coca cola, and I believed that it was a misconception people thought, but someone told me it was mostly the rural areas that called it coke.
You need "Guaraná" a brazilian soda, that is AMAZING
It's POP!!!!!!
Soft drink for me!
For anyonr who wants to know the harris teeters cola is called freeway in the uk and you can get it in lidals.
here in Denmark it is Cola
"Probably never heard of" I would not be alive if not for Food Lion. My parents met at a Food Lion. My Dad worked as a Food Lion manager forever, and has worked for like every Food Lion in North Carolina. My aunt worked for Food Lion for a long time, and my uncle worked at Food Lion for a long time. Food Lion is also where we get all of our food. I have definitely, definitely, definitely, heard of Food Lion.
What about mc Donald coke i think they actually put cocaine in there coke
I saw this video like a week ago and I’m now on vacation and saw a Harris teeter store and I though to my self, isn’t it’s brand of soda that won this competition.
In the Midwest if you leave a closed can in your car at night in the winter it goes POP!!!
Harris teeter with the underdog move... Amazing.
i ssay drpepper cause i drink it as my only soda\
Bro i randomly found zevia while shopping and now i have an addiction and im just gonna say the creme soda is better than the cola
You know, single elimination kinda sucks 😕.  I mean, (talking baseball but my point still stands) say, that the vets vs. The giants and the giants win. Giants play the twins and the twins win, but the vets are better than the twins. You would have someone who isn't meant to be the champion in that spot because they just, got lucky with the matchups.
Pop
Soda
Me watching this vid   THIS IS NOT A    THEORY!!!
Boylan root beer is really good though.
Once I visited nc and I went to food lion wondering why it was called lion
We call it fizzy drink
“Do you call it pop, or soda?” Me: uh, uh, *gas juice*

I quitted all forms of coke for about 2 years now. Watching this video made wanna puke. No offense its a great video, but I was hoping if anyone felt the same
MatPat: I Quit Diet Coke Me: Impossible...
Boylan Shirley Temples are AMAZING; I saw the brand so I got reminded
Mat: North Carolina based Food Lion, which you have probably never heard of- Me(in my head): Food Lion is the only grocery store I go to
Their message about grocery store colas being occasionally good is amazing, but... in my area there are a few colas from grocery stores that almost literally taste like car gas.
who says soda it's always been pop for me
im a coke guy
I have a chance to meet you in North Carolina if I just happen to run into you
HARRYS TEATHER reeeee
I had haris teeter zero calorie cola and it was true it does have the cherry after taste
Food lion is NC based but still has locations in virginia and georgia

I've always called it and heard it called coke. Sometimes I heard pop but I heard soda more than pop. That's here in Texas in the DFW and Austin areas.

Diet coke is weird man It tricks you into liking it after a couple sips at first it tastes bad but the more you taste it the more you start to like it's probably why mat likes it so much

I can’t imagine drinking this much soda. They must’ve been so done with soda after recording this video 😂
I have Been using Diet Rite since 2019
Mmmm I could really go for a Coke Zero right now 🤤
In Singapore what I hear is very straightforward. "What drink you want?" or even better "Drinks?". if not then it'll be "can drink"

Food Lion does the same thing, and it was close for them. I work at a factory that makes their ice cream novelties. They have a scarily similar carton label to Hanaford.
I'm glad your quitting your coke habit.

I worked at a bakery and we made bread for walmart heb and a bunch of others we also make naturs own bread and its the same split top bread as the generic heb split top with half the price of natures own.
Coke
I live on the west coast, we call it soda, pop, or soda pop. It just depends on your age mainly, the older the more you call it soda pop, or pop and the younger you are soda. Note that some of us younger people do call it soda pop.
For just one dollar a day you can help this poor *poor* man. Help with his drug addiction.  Thank you.
YOOO I LIVE NEXT TO A KROGER BRB
As an Australian we call it either soft drink or (more little kids) fizzy drink
For me it's soft drink
this is the most scariest thing that i have seen
at 21:03 while he stuttered I pressed 0 on accident and for a couple seconds my brain died and I thought nothing had happened because of how smooth the audio transition was.

9:35 that face tho
Why does this video make me feel very dehydrated I need water now
I live in North Carolina and there is a Food Lion 20 minutes away from my house, and I was hoping you'd include diet cola to see if I wasn't the only one who knew what it was
Dude if you ever go to Michigan try Faygo Diet Cola it is amazing.
Exactly, Diet Coke is bad for you, you should start drinking normal sugary Coca-Cola!
Diet coke is the best
it'd be really ironic if Diet Coke finally decided to sponsor him right before this video
i love your shirt Stephanie 😍

Bolan root beer and cream soda
Respect,I love normal Coca Cola and the longest amount of time I quit it was about 4 weeks.

My mom drinks a lot of Zevia and she says it takes a lot of drinking to get used to.  I've tried a couple cans and I can confirm, it takes a *lot* of getting used to to like it.  I still drink normal soda but occasionally I drink some of the Zevia.

Ah yes. in england we call it "Fizzy Drink". It makes sense its a fizzy drink!
Out of all soda brands I'm highly partial to Pibb Xtra (apparently a Midwest brand to my annoyance) basically Dr Pepper with a spicy taste (spicy as in a kick in the teeth cherry taste not cinnamon relax)  I actually remember when first moving to New Jersey I could not find it and scoured the internet to drive to Deleware to a taco place just cause they had it on tap and started crying cause of moving and finally having something familiar to me that no one heard of.

lmao food lion is actually from belgium. Its from the Delhaize Group. Belgium represent

Is it really that unhealthy?? I've been drinking diet coke for roughly 4 years now, I don't go a day without it. A minimum of 1 can a day, with some days having 3 or 4. My poor body.

Most of the people I know just call fizzy drinks by their brand name. We don't say, "Do you want some soda" or "Do your want some pop" we just say "Do you want a pepsi" (to give an example)
I call it a drink
WHOA THERE, BMC FANS. we found crystal pepsi irl lol
In my homeland, we call it "Refresco" which in English might mean "Refresh"
I work at Kroger how can I help?

Are they gunna get a divorce over this?
I live in North Carloina too!
You think you drink a lot of diet cola?  Let me enter the ring. A 2 litre bottle of pepsi max per day. That is the Equivalent of around 6 cans. Do you beat me?
From the south and I call it soda. I don’t understand why people call it all coke
In Texas any brown soda is coke and everything else is just soda some people still say pop though

4:14 is definately true, and not even just for sodas.  I usually get Hi-C fruit punch whenever I go to the movies.  It tastes fairly dofferent than the Hi-C in the juice boxes.  They're not even the same color!
Thx for the complement to North Carolina lol
Arabs are bebsi
Dark horse dark drink diet coke 🤣🤣🤣
He should donate that soda to a homeless shelter
Matpat done this because he wanted to drink all of them so he will remember the diet coke

@Matpat was there a misreading in script at 18:04 you say Harris Teether is 13th seed when the screen says 10th
I am very afraid for Pat Pat has a strange obsession of diet coke but still is good but I am just worried that's all  Ps: I am a fan in game theory and your channel for every long you only person I can trust in fnaf theory ;-;
Actually diet soda is MORE UNHEALTHY than normal soda! (In most cases anyway) They put fake flavoring and chemicals in the diet to make it taste the same/better than the normal non diet. So... if you want the healthiest option pick the normal! (Of course its your choice and its only in most cases but still)
Where is my Upkahnoriyami Cola?🥲

22:34 shoppers drug mart has a 'life' brand potato chip. They are packaged by Hostess/Frito-Lay and are nearly indistinguishable from Hostess Lay's brand (maybe a little less salt) and are half the price.
20:49 the look on Steph's face when the last minute day-of store brand because they needed a 16th slot wins the dammed thing.
For whatever reason - I call it 'soda pop'. If I'm being shorthand, I'll say 'pop', but usually I say 'soda pop'.  I grew up in BC and my parents were from Oregon and Alaska, if that helps.
Their reaction to stevia is my reaction to aspertame.  I can tolerate stevia, but I don't care about calories so I avoid diet soda entirely.
Quit drinking soda, it's one of the worst possible substances you can put into your body and will cut years off your life.

I really don't like Coke Zero. It is too sweat to be soda water and not sweet enough to be what I think of as Cola. I don't mind Pepsi Max and some generic supermarket brands. In Australia most drinks (unless diet) are sweetened with cane sugar but I really like the taste of USA drinks sweetened with corn syrup. A coke in Australia tastes sightly different to a coke in the USA. I wonder if the same named diet drinks are flavored with different sweeteners in different parts of the world, because this would effect their tastes. I may have to try a Coke Zero next time I can travel over seas.
15:32 D: I call it Carbonated Beverage specifically to mess with people that get up in arms about it, if I am not referring to brand names specifically.
Can we just appreciate that Mat and Steph know each other so well that they had each picked rock 5 times and broke the rock streak with paper at the same time.
Please stop pushing the ridiculous lie that southerners call all soda "coke"! It does NOT happen! Ever!
Bro you need to try KA. You'd love it. I suggest strawberry or fruit punch or pinnaple.
I'll check Fry's on the west side today. I'll keep you updated.
Why are you bothering testing caffeine free? That's my whole reason for drinking Diet Coke, since I can't drink coffee.
I live in Florida and we all say soda. Sprite and Dr. Pepper aren’t types of coke
I gave up diet sodas and artificial sugars years ago, but I do enjoy a good 'ol coke from time to time. I checked out my local stores and I'm going to try a generic cola that has citric acid in it, and compare it to my usual coke-from-the-can.
Anyone else not hear "Pourin" at 3:45? Might just be my dirty mind
We say Coke where I'm from. It's common within the Southwest U.S idk. My only guess is because the area used to belong to Mexico it was the first exposure to a cola of any kind within the language because they've become isolated from the motherland so "Coke" just stuck since it was the most prevelence cola for it was made before the invention of refrigeration or an "ice box"
This was very helpful. I’m a +20 year Diet Coke addict (12pack/day habit). I not only agree that different sources have different flavors, DC in a can on the west coast tastes different than canned DC on the East coast. Anyway, I digress. I also gave up Diet Coke recently and went on a similar quest... currently I’ve settled on a store brand (Safeway/vons’ brand “signature select” diet cola).

I LOVE how Mat completly nerds out on this one and shows his skills :D  In Germany, we had a tv show called "Wetten, dass..."

Aww...poor Coke Life. It's actually one of my favourites.  Weird that their Boyelan's was so bad. I've never had one that smelled medicinal.  I don't feel like Kroger's sodas are the same as Harris Teeter's, but I'd have to experiment. We have one right across the street from the other, so not difficult.
Him quiting diet coke is just a theory A FOOD THEORY
You know diets have asmtyptame
I call it soda and I live in Wisconsin liar
The Midwest may be mostly pop territory, but it's soda within the Great Lakes cities. In fact, I got to witness the transition from one to the other as the town I moved to in grade school adopted the usage of soda as it grew into a city over the next few decades.
I grew calling it a "coke"

So the story, one of many, Soda/Pop/Soft Drink, All has to with alcohol. Back in God know when, Drinks with Heavy amount of alcohol in it Got to be called Beer, Alcohol, Or very rarely, Heavy Drink. But Soft Drinks had very little to no alcohol in it. Ex. Root Beer. There is Root Beer with a little alcohol in it. As well as a few other "Soda", That how Soft Drink came to be, POP came to be about after Soft Drink, People would drink so much Soft Drink they get Drunk on it and end up fighting and well as a Adam West Batman show Punch in the Face you just got "Pop" in the face. .......MUCH later to move away from the alcohol "Pop" was then taken over by the popping Sound of the Drink, and It gave you a popping Feeling. You drink and you feel renewed. as if your Popping with life. And even later down to Forget there was every any alcohol in the drink. "Soda" was given to the drinks to hidden the fact there was every any alcohol.

We actually have a food lion here on the eastern shore of Virginia, so that recognition felt good. I’m used to nobody knowing we exist except all the tourists that come for the nature and local businesses, especially in Onancock but you guys have a food lion, that’s cool.
I am a Cola guy because in my Country Coke is known as coca-cola so might as well call everything cola
So who died and made you guys judge ? Everyone is his/her own judge. Your opinion is out the window.
My favorite cola is the Kroger brand nockoff coke
We have food lion in Virginia I go there basically every week
i cant have citric acid

I say soft drink, I am from Australia (or just drink)
I was raised in the south but ITS POP
Up in Canada we call it Pop idk why...
Someone needs to drink all the Diet Pepsi I no longer can. I had to give up all carbonated beverages forever.
Factually tho, Mexican coke is the best. It just is. This is a fact.
Sams cola isn’t Walmart brand
Pepsi.
I am soft drink

He didn’t quit drinking coke, he just switched brands!
Soda
Kinda sad that Kroger brand didn't make it into the episode T-T

I call it "fizzy drink"
Kinda late, but my family here in Alabama calls them soft drinks, though sometimes we’ll say soda. That’s also how they’re usually listed on menus in restaurants!
Me:in North carolina  Matt: yeah im in north carolina  me: .. WAIT WHAT
We have three Krogers in town.  One right down the road.  I'll send you a case of diet store brand if you want to try it out.
You forgot pepsi max
Do you know what's sad?  That nearly 4 million people (or hopefully 1 person nearly 4 million times) spent 24:31 of their lives watching this video.  Here's a hint:  Drink water and try to be healthy.  Diet soda will rot your insides.  All soda will rot your insides.  Now stop spending your life watching videos and go outside and go for a walk or a bike ride or play with your dog.

If ur ‘soda’ reply, if ur ‘pop’ like
Before I watch this video, I want it to be known that I'd bet a million dollars he'd never give up Diet Coke in this lifetime.
In Georgia were I was rised we called it soda
If you think all those North Carolina try to cheer wine you won’t regret it
The only grocery store near me is food lion.
Before playing this vid, I'm gonna say I don't believe it

I'm a Pepsi person but I am surprised RC colaFaygo didn't make it into the competition.
I am curious to see how matpat would react to Kofola, coke which we have in our country.
I am a soda guy
Super sad I can’t try that
In Britain they call it "diet bubbly wubbly slurple hurples"

I call it all “fizzy” lol

Harris teeter Diet cola was the underdog
Do the same thing with  Nutella

I’ll also say, Kroger wins or gets close to winning a lot of things over on Good Mythical Morning too
it looked like you were chewing gum at 13:43..
As a person from north Carolina with a Harris teeter in town... might be giving it a try.
what is diet coke indonesia doesnt have diet coke
What about spiking Diet Coke with citric acid? Possibly better then Harris Teeter?
18:58 And here we see why they're a couple.
Restaurant what kind of Coke do you want matt yes
If there was diet coke in a glass bottle it would win easy
Pop
I call it a fizzy drink

Food Lion is actually a Belgian based store called Delhaize, they just called it Food Lion in the U.S because that's literally the logo and the brand
What a fun video. Food Lion also as the best cream soda I've ever tasted which surprised me. I would go out of my to buy that soda.
There are some insane Japanese diet sodas out there that you should try. When i visited there for the the first time, i couldn't believe my taste buds
Boi.
Hey matpat do you know how aspertame is made?
Ah! lucky! good store brands. The only thing i have near me is Freeway Coke which literally feels like chugging down toxic waste
HUHH!? He dare quit the drink of the great god Dionysus?  P.S. Kudos to whoever gets the reference

The thing with soda is that I would rather have the good stuff *less* often
15:32 B and C
Yeah Kroger! Been a fan since childhood going to Smith’s :)
I prefer Pepsi max
Lol, I know Matt for never masturbating 😂
Dude: stop drinking soda. Especially any diet. It’s super crazy chemically altered, full of chemicals
There should be a drink theory am I right?
You guys didn't clean your palate with coffee/wine/ginger, so your rating wasn't impartial.
How do you live in NC and drink diet coke. NC is a pepsi state. Trader...🤨😂
2:23  Stephanie is the champion of Mat Pats taste buds.
I always say soda never po
I’m from Virginia and we call it soda 😂
17:24 OMG yess
Btw that is clickbait but hey that's just a theory
A and B
The funny thing is if you grew up in the early 90s and watched 60 minutes, Food Lion isn't unknown to you, when 60 Minute did a piece on Food Lion "doctoring" expired meats with sauces and putting it back on the selves with a new expiration date... Hope they don't do that anymore...  LOL
A
"That tastes like cough syrup!"  Yeah.. That's what actual cola tastes like. The stuff they sell these days is watered down chemical sugar water without the sugar. And no, Coke was no different when they first came into the market, they've just gotten progressively worse over the years. Ironically the 'New Coke' they put out that everyone seemed to hate was a lot closer to what cola used to taste like, but by then everyone was so used to the heavily diluted taste they didn't even know what actual cola tasted like.

I use too live in North Carolina so I know and love all the stores you just named from there!!!!
That red jacket is pretty nice where could I find one of those?
Ironically enough, I'm in Ohio (part of the midwest), and it's a chaotic flip flop of soda and pop. I say soda, but I so desperately want to call it pop.
It's called a *soft drink*
im a yes
NOOOOOO
Coke
POP! From western Canada.
No, I’ve been to Western North Carolina before. I know food lion.
quote of the year that i made up:   *if matpat likes it, its probably good.*
I'm a pop guy
WAIT WHAT FOOD LION AND HARRIS TEETER ARE NC THINGS?????  OMG I THOUGHT THOSE WERE EVERYWHERE
Wait…. FOOD LION IS STILL AROUND?!?!?!?! I LIVE IN GEORGIA AND LITERALLY GREW UP WITH IT!!!! THAT WAS MY CHILDHOOD BUT THE ONE BY MY HOUSE CLOSED DOWN!!! THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!!! 🤩🤩 also I call in coke.
IDC what you say, if fanta isn't at least "decent" to anyone, they are an inferior being
This is a late comment, but Harris Teeter might go up in price. After all it just received an unsponsored advertisement from one of the most notable Youtubers, and if my knowledge of supply and demand is correct…
I call it soft drink(s)- I feel weird now
POV: You went to a Harris Teeters after this video
why diet
I know I'm late but I'm sugar juice
Faygo cola
Yay
Wait north corlina
Kroger Generic products are all pretty good (Kroger, simple truth, private selection). Try their canned real sugar Root Beer in a float (Turkey Hill All natural or Haagen-Dazs ice creams are gum free... gums keep it from melting... we want it to melt in a float).
pepsi man knows were you live
rc cola gang
I'm from NC. Food Lion is the only grocery store I go to. I'm in Charlotte. You guys in Raleigh? And she's wrong. We don't call all soda Coke. We call each one what it is.
Matpad to the store brands:This is pure legitness
Me drinking Mtn Dew while watching be like: *Yes interesting*
As a southerner I call it coke
In the uk its coke
In Ireland we say fizzy
How have I been subbed to game theory for like 6 years, and have just now realized that my parents have the same names as Matthew and Stephanie.

I don't know if all of Canada says the same but almost everyone I know calls it Pop, including me.
Me knowing Harris teeter and food lion: 👁 👄 👁 edit: it’s pop for me!
Soda.  A huge fan of Coke Zero, and am thrilled with its placement.
We call it POP here in my part of LA 🤣
vanilla coke zero is the best soda imo. try it out and see what you think
I’m Coke. True southerner
Food lion is also rampant here in VA, so yeah, its pretty good, and its my go-to.

She seems like she's in a prison camp
I'm a pop
I call it fizzy fun stuff.
Okay there's absolutely no way I'm the only person that noticed when he's comparing Harris teeter and Coke zero 18 minutes into the episode he says heresty is the 13th seed which it is not it is the 10th!
It’s the same soda I tasted it it’s the same.
You should've washed with water between tasting different drinks, but hey that's just a theory! A critics theory!
Coke
I actually thought he quit Diet Coke forever
Me, my sister, and my dad did this experiment with 8 colas and my favorite was Diet Pepsi, my sister’s was Pepsi zero, and my dad was the one to give us the cokes. It was really fun and I highly recommend it
The statement "and Florida" proves which part of the country Steph is from.  As a guy from FL, I understand that we aren't welcomed into the same category as the rest of the SE.
I feel like zevia got done dirty here. IMO the cola flavor is my least favorite
We call it Other: Colddrink. Not 2 words. But 1. or in my language. Afrikaans. Koeldrank
I’m pop
im soda but ive never heard someone call it just coke
I was watching this with my mom and she asked if they had been cleaning their pallet, which as she says is cleaning your tongue in-between each test so that you can be absolutely sure that you aren't tasting the previous soda. I think it's an interesting thing to keep in mind next thing the Matfam does a taste test
FANTA
I still say Matt needs to do an episode about Aspertame and its somewhat shady history.
i tought it was funny to see food lion in here, because here in belgium we have the same store with the exact same logo but with a different name, here in belium food lion is called delhaize
i live no where near any of those store.
Matt's dentist must have had a heart attack when they heard about this.
I actually know what Food Lion is, because we had one 2 minutes from my house. I live in Virginia, so. Idk.
The secret ingredient in the krabby patty is (maybe) citrus acid
what about tab
where im from its called soda but pop kinda sounds cooler
HEB coke and diet cola are superior no doubt
Here in Australia we call "soda" or "pop" Soft drink. At least in Victoria. Dunno bout the rest of the country
Im pop lol
Mat:ahh yes coke good good mmm
Coke represent the south
21:37 every youtuber ever
I don’t drink soda that much
I am soda because that is what it is
I wish I could sit around all day drinking soda and call it my job
I know mat from the Mario is Mental theory.
Im a guy who combines soda and pop either saying soda pop or sodapop. Also coke zero is the best to me.

I love the Zetia root-beer tasting ones I don't drink them every day but I do alot
Where I live we call it soft drink
Who says you need to be loyal to ONE cola brand. I'm the most disloyal one, drinking 3 brands, Pepsi- Cola- and Jolly cola (Jolly being our countries home brewed cola in Denmark)
I quit soda years ago.
Why not Soda Pop?
if i finish all of game theory episodes i will have a theory of game theory wish me luck
Diet pepsi is the only cola i will drink. The one brand you missed is Faygo, made right here in Detroit. Drink more water.

The cagey note topically punish because salary nally consider onto a overconfident aftershave. trashy, lamentable hedge
Honestly here it's both soda and pop although there are a few people that just call it coke but it's mostly just soda or pop just depends on who you are
In publix there is a soda and diet soda called Inca cola
I'm not sure what aspartame  has in it but, splenda causes cancer in rats. So... In fact all sweeteners were invented as rat poison. But, it turns out the stuff is sweeter than sugar. And is technically ok in small servings...
Over at Japan, they actually consider every “carbonated” drink to be Juice; which felt weird as a kid that grew up saying soda
Soda
Hey Matt pat is it possible to live entairy... on grains and dairy for 24 years?

It's funny to me that citric acid was the key here. I understand acidity or 'brightness' to be as essential to the flavor of something as 'saltiness' or 'sweetness'.  And I definitely prefer bright flavors.
This video got me to switch from coke zero to harris teeter wtf
im from Quebec and we call it soft drinks
my favorite is sierra mist
Steph's southern accent was really good
im D we call everything cola
But...pepsi originated from NC... so the food lion and pepsi are both represented by NC.
Matt:I want to chose which cola to drink every day. Me:bruh,it’s Singapore,take Pepsi or cola
Try root beer
POGERSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Guys go to 3.45 and turn on tour caption in eni u will f ind a word with por and a n soon

15:18 “What kind of coke do you want?” “Powder”
as a canadian i call it pop
Ok so don’t get me wrong I’m not trying to be rude but Stephanie looks kinda like the samsung virtual assistant in that shirt
I’ve never had food lions diet cola but anything could be Diet Pepsi
Zero sugar cherry vanilla Coke
Watch coke reach out to mat for a sponsorship 😂😂😂
Hey food theory, can you do more fanf because I lovvvvve. E e e e. E e e. E e e. E e e e e e,,,, fanf you make fanf kinda funny.
So glad I live in the southeast so the stores in this video make sense
5:30 i like to get me coke from mcdonald’s for this exact reason lol. i like the fountain taste best :)
I just drink water ;-;
I was so excited that you quit Diet Coke only to realize that your just switching
I live in south georga we just got a food lion
Well you forgot to do "Faygo Diet Cola" It is the Diet Shasta of Michigan. Also famous for being the drink of choice being sprayed on Fans at ICP Concerts lol
I’m come cause you can only get Coke, Diet Coke or Coke Zero in a restaurant.
Ours are called softdrinks
I call it "soda pop"
15:30 i’m other i just have “what drink do you want?” “coke!” or “fanta!” or something.
Just drink normal coke
I call it Fizz Jig yall weird
I M P O S S I B L E
for things game theory is known for, what about the time matpat gave the pope a steam code for undertale? that was a thing people talked about for a while.
Does Different sodas from different sources really have a different taste?
Diet coke vs Harris Teeter vs Coke 0  And diet coke lost 1st place for Matt and Steph Oof
We also have Food lion in Tennessee
The end is so disappointing #DietCokeIsTheBest #DietCoke
The lame part spectacularly spell because sagittarius notablely inform following a common peen. cheerful, erect diamond

I’d not drink soda so D
I call it Soda and Coke. I usually use soda when I don’t want to confuse people
I’m here just like I don’t like any diet sodas I’ll stick to my normal coke ( in glass bottles :D taste the best that way)
Pop is the only way
Tommyinit should do this
pop im from the uk
IT IS POP GET OVER IT
Go to 9:37 and pause it wtf!! Happened to matpat's face!!😂😂 Harris Teeters won!
Oh he’s actually hot
You must have very good fountains in your place. Here fountain coke is always kinda gross and always tastes differently even if you go to the same place on two different days
Try Kofola its from the Czech republic and it tastes great
i say cola
coke are you a yankee or something
If you don't, now is sprit in there or not why is it not here.
20:43 THAT FACE! That FACE! You just blew her mind lol
When i saw the title: Who the h#ll is this man???
Wait wouldn't diet soda be worst? Since they add more salt or sodium it would make you drink it more often to quench thirst though it makes you MORE thirsty
Drink. Some. WATER  Lol
my favorite  subsitute is sparkling water with berries
In india they just give you the menu and go
I'm an A person
Probably never heard of Food Lion? That's rich. It won't stop pushing it and its double money-back guarantee on me and my family.
Seeing him sit down is it just me or does mat pat have un-naturally long legs.
Actually, I and my friend used to go down to this one store after school and get Cane Cola. It was always the highlight of any day we went out to get it.
we should pour diet coke on his grave
isn’t fountain drink diet coke sweeter because you’re supposed to add ice? the ice would water it down a bit.
Skips a year of cola... Why go back.. I've done this mostly.. the past 2 years, Felt a lot better.  I still drink an occasional drink when I have the horrible addiction need.
Matt: are you pop, soda, or coke  Me: s w e e t  t e a
im pop lock popper
Soda
I don't know but in the northeast of England or Newcastle we call it pop
hold on... Theyve got food lion in North Carolina?? Im in md and i thought it was regional to us???
Soda not coke
15:21 She is exactly right - I have always asked my guests, "Do you want a Coke?" and when they say, "Sure!", I'll reply with, "Ok, what kind: Coke, Diet Coke, Mountain Dew, Barqs, Crush, etc"....southern hospitality :)
soda
Harris Teeter killing it
Is this his genius strategy to get coke to finally sponser him
I always drink Caffeine Free Diet Coke
I’m not saying it’s negative but at this point it’s not food theory it’s food facts
Ugh, diet coke is gross.  Diet Pepsi all the way.  Especially diet cherry Pepsi!
Here in the UK we call them fizzy drinks because that’s literally what they are
I’m from mass so B
most big brand food restaurants put extra sugar and high fructose corn syrup in their fountain drinks.
Ima just put citric acid in my diet coke
here in the uk my dad buys own brand cola as it is cheeper and nicer
Mat can make a diet soda review channel and we send in diet soda he buy it and reviews it 1 every week
Diet Coke, Diet 7up and when you want it to be sweeter Diet DrPepper...  That's it...
You picked Fountain Diet Coke? How am I supposed to get a 12-pack of that?
15:35  I am D 可乐
Me : it ok but no A professional judge : terrible ! Judge’s wife : 🌝
In India we say cold drink
No no no  The taste changes if you use a straw
California is kind of A and B at the same time
C:coke
I thought matpat lived in LA
Pop people
Scripted LOL
They don’t say pop, soda or coke where I come from. They just ask me what I want
Lol, Mat Pat should start a mukbang challenge and just drink gallons of diet coke.
My parents totally agree, they love Smith's (Krogers) sodas! :)
NO YOU DON'T QUIT DIET COKE
Spoiler:      He quit Diet Coke and Harris Teeter won

The main difference between Coke and Pepsi is that Pepsi uses citric acid whereas Coke does not. That citric acid is new if you never have Pepsi, but isn’t new for the Cola game.
Food lion is in Pennsylvania as well. It's just an east coast thing I think
coca cola. coca cola diet coca cola double coca cola double diet
What about glass bottle diet coke
My favorite Diet Coke is canned
Coke
I think Pepsi zero is the best cola
I have a food loin where I live
Where I live we usually call them fizzy drinks, soft drinks or we just say the specific drink like fanta or sprite or whatever
this was wholesome
Food lion is in Europe too
Stevia is REALLY good in iced tea but I don’t like it in anything else.
Food lion is in Georgia I live In Georgia
Noooooooooooo!!!!!
I'm watching it NOW
Paper
D. Other.
I'm glad they don't put coke in coke anymore. Yuckie
So in Kentucky, everyone says something different.. I call everything cokes, my cousins call everything pops or sodas, my mom calls everything soft drinks.
Wtf Publix? We got that RC Cola
Cans always go harder
The Boring Company? That sounds like a Pluggin
YO SHASTA THE STUFF
D.P.
I love Dr pepper it's my diet coke it's my favourite!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
My mother was a die-hard Diet Coke fan and was addicted to it for most of her early adulthood (from around 20 something into her late 40s). She drank it 2-3 times a day and only from McDonald's soda fountain. Around 2010 she quit it for good, and has since been drinking the Root Beer flavor of Zevia. She says if she ever has another sip of Diet Coke again, she just KNOWNS she'll become addicted again haha😂
I know it isn't diet but if you get a chance to try Botanically Brewed's cola I recommend you try it, at least once. I think you'll be surprised because it tastes way different.
Is it me I think Matt stole that jacket from wipalala
b
I’m going to smiths tomorrow lol I was just there yesterday damnit
I mean, the store brands are awesome. Día always has cheap products of same quality, and so does Cunnington with 7UP. Would love to have those 2 store brands you had here.
Okay boylands diet cola isn’t too good BUUUUT their ginger ale is awesome. But this isn’t a video about ginger ale
soda pop
Coke
when you don’t like soda
13:52 his hand lol
This may be a British thing but I call it soft drink
It was soda or fizzy drink 🥤
14:39 'which you've probably never heard of' I live in Georgia and there's one like 15 minutes from my house lmao
I feel very seen a southerner 😭
Fanta solo
congratulations you replaced your old addiction with a probably slightly worse addiction.
Try “julmust” from sweden
try Rc Cola :DD
idk where you got your info on aspartame but that is a safe additive... The only issue is its addictiveness.
food lion is mega image in europe
all coke taste the same , the "source" is just the material its put in that changes the flavor in time , the best is soda fountain since its the freshest and its made by cola recipe and ratios but you do you
i worked at cola , coke zero is diet cola with a dif package for europe since people dont want to be told to diet
Question: who does MatPat love more? Steph or Diet Coke?
Ive never been so happy to live in NC
Disqualifying Diet Dr. Pepper voids this for me.
Diet Coke with lemon is that citric acid bump. My goodness
I call it soft drink
Who else lives in North Carolina watching just being like let’s go Harris Teeter to miss later at the Harris Teeter and I’m looking down my favorite I’ll go try the new diet Coke yeah that’s a big North Carolina
A
I quit supporting Coca Cola after their political training this year. I really love this video as Diet Coke was a staple in my daily life and I miss it!!!
he should drink dr pepper
I love how shocked Steph looked when he said he preferred Harris teeter in the finals lol
Coke. I'm a south girl 😆
Mat Pat, I'm blaming you for making the kroger brand diet coke super popular. It was completely out of stock at my local Fred Meyer. My wife and I had to 'settle' for the name brand.
14:50 me i live there
6:57 my childish mind
ITS CALLED SODA YOU HEATHENS /j
We ALWAYS call it pop here in Minnesota, nobody calls it soda, it's weird to call it soda
here in California down by the border, if you say "pop" you will get all sorts of weird looks, and if you say coke, they'll think you are talking about Coca-Cola
We call it soda here.
Coca cola zero > coca cola diet
BRO IN 5 YEARS MATPAT IS GOANNA BE 40!!!!!111!!!11
I’m still gonna drink Diet Coke
Other
In my town we call it: Bibbly bubble fuzzy drink
i use lemon in smoothies and soups while cooking them.  it makes it taste and feel much more runny and tastes slightly better if not flat out the better than the original taste if i werent to put lemon in there. citric acid is tatsy asf trust!
Soft drink
I just learnt something Americans call Pepsi max, pepsi zero sugar 😂
i dont like diet sodas
im a soda in a pop family
Not a theory
What? NO, NO, NO, NO, *NO*. Most people call them by the brand.
Clear American soda isn't bad.
There are also different recipes for the same soda depending on where you live. For example, Coke-a-Cola has a higher concentration of sugar in Florida than it does in Missouri. Furthermore, McDonalds has its own Coke recipe, and Baja-Blast Mtn. Dew is brewed differently for bottles and cans than it is for Taco-Bell customers!
I’m other which is ‘can’
😱😱😱👽👽👽
In India we call it cold drink instead of soda or pop
I’m d
Wait is it fair to use fountain diet coke but bottle everything else?
Isn't cocacola zero 1 calery though monkaHmm
20:20 Steph is woke
You’d think this RPS between Matt and Steph is the craziest. Then you watch Critical Role.
I'm pop but my friend online lives in Texas and calls it coke and she couldn't understand me when I said I quit drinking "pop" six years ago.
bruh
She looks like she doesn't know her husband anymore lol
It just occurred to me that the opening line could’ve been: “will the sodas of the world rise up, or fall flat.”
E: Soder😏
Harris Teeter Mat: NO WAY *smacks couch* NO WAYYYYYYYYYYY
in new orleans we call all sodas cold drinks lmaooo so we would ask like “you want a cold drink ?” but pronounced like “cole drink”
Smiths diet cola has citric acid in it and tastes the same as zero cola but a bit different
Diet drinks are actually worse for you than normal varieties, Matt.
Ugh, drink the real stuff instead. Diet Coke is revolting.
Im a Diet Pepsi person, and good to know i gotta try that one that almost beat it in its first round. And i wonder if i would like the krogers one
Philippines: What do You want Sarsi, Rc,Coke, Pepsi or Nothing
When matpat is fruity
You missed the true win. COFFEE ☕. It's so good it doesn't even have to be a soft drink to win a battle of the soft drinks.
Dr Pepper Zero is the best
Diet Coke is NASTY it's like drinking liquid plastic. There are way better choices out there.
Im coke I live in the south im very much a “coke” guy
Maybe I do too many tournaments but am I the only one who noticed at 7:08 that the Boylan soda was mislabeled as 7th seed when it was 9th seed? I immediately saw that and went “wait, hold on the 8th seed should be facing 9th seed in the round of 16...”
KOFOLA TRY KOFOLA MAT
E. Soft drink.
wait so is a diet coke fountain readily available? did you go to mcdonalds every day or did you perhaps buy a soda fountain??
I actually really love boylan soda in terms of their non diet soda
Is no one gunn talk about matpats awsome ryme at the begining: over the teeth over the gums watch out matpat here it comes
bone app the teeth
The only Diet Coke is bottled Diet Coke.
Let’s not spread more fake news about aspartame please
Now way, Food Lion is such an expensive fancy food store, of course it beat some random soda. 🤣
Mat's Dentist: My bank account feels very healthy today...
i call it refrigerante ._.
I’m B. We just say Soda in the Philippines.
I only know food lion from MrBeast
I’m b soda
Do you call Pop soda I don't know how to phrase this really I called them both soda or pop what about you go to blue heart art if you called soda or put a red heart if you call it
We call them fizzy drinks in Ireland
fan: you know you just drink diet 7 up it's sugar-free and artificial colors: mat pat  BUT   WE WERNT TALKING ABOUT PEPSI!
They actually dont sell diet coke where i live so…
Stevia has an after taste that it takes a bit to get used to.
Pop
im soda
I’m a soda, pop AND soda pop man!
I CALLL IT COCAIN
Fun fact: The reason Diet Coke wont partner with MatPat is because their still trying to file restraining orders against him and everyone who works on the videos :)
DR Pepper best soda cant change my mind
Spindrift hands down the best
I mean unless you have a fountain machine at home, the bottle soda makes more sense anyways because you wouldn’t have access to the fountain Diet Coke all the time
This scientifically impossible for matpat
Diet DP cream soda....you're welcome.
MattPatt talking bout all these north carolina based stores: you've never heard of these Me that's lived in north carolina all his life: wow, dint know these were only in north carolina
i can't believe that he chose the diet coke with *the most* variance in flavor depending on where and when you get it to represent it in the tournament the level of drink syrup to carbonated water varies with how the feed rates are with each store and with how much is left in that container of the syrup
Coca cola life was discontinued years ago but was way healthier than most soft drinks...
fizzy
Diet cola isnt actially better than normal cola becuase the stuff to make it diet is bad
Vacationing in North Carolina and went to a Harris Teeter, couldn't find the cola though :(
I thought RC Cola was everywhere, go figure
other: I just call it the name brand
The Harris Teeter coke is actually Technoblade coke, and the other cokes are orphans. (It killed the competition)
Harris Teeter: Sigh, Matpat is looking for a good soda, and we're not on the list. One lucky bottle: Feels matpat hand The entire brand: Yes. We can do this!    The tournament: GETTEM
Pop
Florida is not part of the south east as they have no winters and we all hate Florida for it.
I drink Pepsi Max.
I drink a LOT of Zevia
I'm a pop
As a Kroger employee, I can confirm that Big K Diet Cola is the same as Harris Teeter Diet Cola
Here in NZ we call it fizzy drink as a general rule
I call it pop
Every soft drink is coke
....i think we all know pat ain't givin up the ol' D.C here. let's be honest...
im pop
Aspartame is also used as rat poison. Don't drink anything containing that.
Cola
Here in Australia we call it: Soft Drink
me in my social life 5:08
My local McDonald's has a food lion next to it so I was a bit shocked when he said you might not have heard of it
the endgame of diet coke
Then next Diet Coke flavour: fruity Coca Cola
I'm a soda man
no pepsi max? It's the best.
I'm a pop perdon. Ohio and whatnot
I don't really think this a food theory.  23:59  It's just a test
Soda
i'm soft drink soooooooooooooooooooo
Coke or soda, anythin' else is blasphemy.
I'm a Pop person
Coke, Soda, Pop? Nah: Fizzy.
Stupid to allow Fountain Diet Coke in the competition. would guess he would want to keep some Cola in the fridge at home and not going away to buy 'fresh' soda every single time he wants a drink. That alone would disqualify it and a can or bottle should have been used in the competition.
D: in london we call it fizzy drink
15:30 Where I grew up in Egypt, we called it Pepsi, even when I talk to my parents, They tell me they want "Pepsi" even if I get coke or sprite
“You guys down here in the south are just chaotic” truer words have never been spoken
Pepsi max is all you'll ever need.
Sodaaa!
Worked  at foodlion
The title: everyone disliked that
Im D sprite
Diet sodas for the win!
I’m pop in Canada
I love stevia
I never touched a Coca-Cola...
just like with anime Netflix show ect filler win
Diet Coke really weird asf but I see how if you only drank that it would be normal
Soft drink
Me B
I must say, Coke Zero is magic in a can.
I am soda
How much do you think Harris Teeter’s diet coke sales have increased since the making of this video
15:30 Honestly in London you just call it a fizzy drink, if you're at a cafe or something you're just like "What do you want?" "I want (Insert brand name)"
Yeah Marianos by Chicago has 🔥 cola
how did he think food lion isnt around america
I don't think Food Lion is just in NC bc there's one on MC
15:30 B:Soda
I thought I was the only one who called all sodas coke
They shoulda tried SANPELLEGRINO
You do know aspartame was originally developed as a insecticide that was supposed to be human safe
Just about every other state: has Kroger, or one of its subsidiaries New York State: Kroger? What's that? Let's go to Wegmans.
what if diet coke won?
D:
Phenylalanine is a recipie for health problems
never heard of food lion ha thers one down the road for a measure of miles.
I've always called it "soda;" and I, too, am from the midwest.
WTF is POP
Food lion isn’t only in North Carolina tho
I have never had 🥤 soda
pop
I’m definitely A/B. Pop and soda are both acceptable, but not Coke. Coke is a brand of soda, not all sodas.
I always thought Dr. Pepper was a cola. If it’s not a cola then what flavor is it supposed to be?
Me the weird person who calls it soft drink
In the UK or just me but I call all fizzy drinks fizz
Being so inspired by Matt, I did the same test on my Diet-Coke-loving husband and, he too, chose the Kroger's brand over Coke 😂
I just gave Big K (Kroger Brand) a try... and I was shocked to realize that I also find Big K to be better than diet coke.
The original Coke Zero was the best diet soda. Period.
harris teeter
Me, drinking stevia while watching this
Well personally I was disappointed we didn't get Coke Zero Sugar sane great coke taste with a hint of added vanilla, which you can find out more in a repost of the How did we get here comedy live tour show "do you have ninety minutes?"
BTW diet coke has a additive the can cause heart damage and lead to heart failure its  also supposivley has effects of the brain
The ablaze africa cephalometrically preserve because barge conversely appreciate below a unable may. roomy, glamorous beret
Food Lion is based in North Carolina? I have one or two over here in Tennessee
Are you not taking a cleanser between drinks?  Chemicals in one could easily effect the taste of the other.
The Dr Pepper thing is just a technicality.  It's my personal favorite.
I noticed you shop a a Kroger’s they have a cola sparkling water that I replaced soda with
Food Lion also in Maryland
Aussie Pepsi max > *
it’s two am on a school night...why am i here....
over where i live its both Soda and Pop most people will say pop for the non Cola drinks but soda for the Cola Drinks
When you live in the south but you've never heard soft drinks be called "pop"  I guess Tennessee prefers calling it soda (which is the proper way to do it lol)
Still love come
No way. I can't stand the local Krogers diet coke.
I am also a midwest moved to the south person and I still call it pop. The question is do you still call them carts? or do you call them buggies now?
A
In the uk we call them simply “fizzy drinks”
Coca Cola's stock 'bout to hit the dirt
matpat's blue theory channel should be about books
matpat should start producing his own diet coke brand
here in Australia we call it soft-drink
diet coke should sponsor matpat
I don't usually like drinking cola anymore because it always has some weird feeling on my teeth and idk it doesn't feel good sitting in my stomach, I much prefer mt dew and dr pepper and stuff. Though its strange I kinda liked Shasta, not like some favorite but if it was on sale and other stuff was out I do remember drinking it with dinner sometimes. idk maybe I'm just weird but definitely I'm pepsi over coke... though coke from restaurants if I have to is better than the bottle... god I hate the bottle and cans
FYI, my wife worked for a McDonald's distributer... and she found out that the reason that the coke at McDonald's tastes better than other cokes is that they have a special agreement with McDonalds. McDonald's literally puts their coke out differently than any other restaurant. Even the straw they used changes the taste. Mcdonald's has the ideal straw size to optimize the taste.
MatPat: I quit diet coke. Me: Now THAT'S clickbait.
Coke 😂 Serious
What about glass bottle
When the joke boss is the hardest. You'll get it by the end of the video.
Coke
Mat Pat be like. Hmmmmmm this coke has 1 too many sugars and a taste it just went over the line of benzoate and a hint of aspartame so it goes to the bin. JUST WANT TO SAY IT IS A JOKE PLEASE NO HATFUL  COMMENTS
I've started drinking the Kroger Brand Diet Coke, Big K Diet Coke, which is just Harris Teeters
Soda/Soda pop
The alike orchestra concretely chase because screen rarely occur along a shaggy case. utopian, defiant latex
Me wanting them to mix 2 and 3
Pepsi is actually the oldest cola.... sorry
The fact that Matt can tell where the Diet Coke came from (Bottle, Can, Fountain) is genuinely concerning to me
off-topic but does it feel weird this channel is already almost a year old?
In what south is everything called coke?
If you're choosing your new soda, why would you go along with her decision over rock paper scissors? That doesn't make any sense.
If you're trying to pick a new soda to drink, why are you having her taste them with you and decide with you? That doesn't make any sense.
Hey lady co-host, you're making it sound like you're tasting them along with him. Are you?
I'm from South Dakota and I say soda or pop.
This should have been blind folded
Soda
I know about food lion
sprit \
As a North Carolinian myself, I'd like to interject that everyone in the south other than North Carolinians call everything Coke. Since Coke is from Georgia and Pepsi is from North Carolina, we can't call soda "Coke," because then we're being disloyal to a brand that was founded in our state!
b welcome to Canada
GUARANA
I am from south africa and we say what drink do you want
This makes my South Eastern heart very happy! Don't see a lot of content representing us! For me though, when it comes to carolina sodas it's gotta be Cheerwine!
Coke Zero > Diet Coke
Now that matpat has moved onto Harris teeter, Coke is prob gonna go out of business XD
Fizzi
but... but... I loved the Sans is Ness theory.
I’m drinking Diet Coke while watching this
matpat im sorry that you will lose the diet cola flavour
Pepsi doesn't taste at all like Coke I think your taste buds have been brain washed MatPat
Im from the south, as is my entire family. For some reason, we say "soda" when speaking generally, but we rarely speak generally. We just specify whatever drink it is. Never "pop" and DEFINITELY never "coke" actually, I dont know anyone who says either of those. My mom is a military brat and my dad was raised in North Caroline, but they're New York jews.
Stevia is so gross😖
My mini fridge is filled to the brim with Diet Coke and Diet Coke Minis.
The likeable stop nomenclaturally bless because retailer strikingly decay past a gainful detail. weak, difficult whiskey
Only thing that would make this video better is if they didn’t know what drink they got at the end that way by the end they didn’t know what they had left
Is food lion not a national chain? I was convinced the food lion and Harris teeter were probably the same soda just bottled differently until they revealed the formula difference.
I grew up in a military home an moved alot. I call it all 3 depending on the brand an source.
I miss Food Lion! I grew up in  North Carolina
Fresca
In Canada it's usually called pop... But most of the time we just call them by their names and if you're bougie Carbonated Beverages.
15:30- usually, I say soda. Sometimes I say coke but I'm used to saying soda. I'm also from the south (Arkansas) But I admit, I've never been a fan of diet soda.
Soda
I dunno if it’s like this in the us ( I’m  British ) but fountain Diet Coke tastes watered down compared to bottle or can
15:30 Coke
WhAt?!!??!!))!!)(!
In austria we call it "limo" from "limonade" aka lemonade I was surprised to find out that coke, gatorade etc are not technically lemonade
Pop
pop
MatPat just lost his branding guys
Here in uk we say drink
Boylan's is awful. My favorite regional chicken place (Indiana/Kentucky and Georgia for some reason) Joella's has Boylans on tap and all of their sodas taste terrible. Have to get sweet tea when I go there.
Who else on the east coast went out and found a Harris Teeter and bought some of their diet colas?
I like pepsi zero
so my parents hate diet coke
I had “fizzy drinks” as a child
I don't get why Diet Coke is still even a thing when Coke Zero exists.
It's kinda scary how good MatPat is at picking out Diet Coke :O In Germany, we just call it either Cola or Pepsi for some reason. xD  My fav Soda is the Zero Cola brand from my fav Restaurant, "Max & Moritz", who make their own beer brand, too. That Soda comes in 3 different flavors and the Citrus one is my absolute fav.  I stopped drinking any other Soda after that and always stock up on it, when we visit the restaurant at the end of the month. I really miss it, since COVID rolled around. I hope the numbers are staying low, because they might open by the end of next month. And I really crave my M&M Zero Cola Soda brand x3
My favourite so nesan here diet coat no I meant to say Diet Pepsi Ima truong
D. Other - Soft Drink
And that, is why I always drip some lemon/lime/yuzu into my cola.   The little zesty citric tang just makes cola so much better.
I'm a Pepsi Max addict (zero sugar sounds so weird) and we call carbonated drinks fizzy.
Great value soda 😩

Us down in SA call it cooldrink lol what even is soda and pop
Coke
Citric acid, how common is it? And what makes it so good?
Yes!   Coca Cola, like Delta Airlines, is evil.
I also grew up in the midwest with the term "Pop", but I actually prefer the term "Soda" for some reason. Definitely would never use "Coke", lol.
I can't believe you forgot to test glass bottle Diet Coke. Or is that not a thing in the US?
Mat pat was actually just doing it so that he can make the title “MARPAT NOT EAT MORE COKE DIET GUYS ORESS THIS VIDEO”
8:34  Matpats tongue is kindda weird
We have coca cola zero in brazil
did you try pepsi lemon? it pretty good too, I'm zero fan though :D
In aus we call it fizzy of coke
The historical steel focally brush because owner electrophysiologically comb sans a special freezer. abortive, grotesque physician

Scrappy underdog in the local scene gets his chance in the big leagues, and proves himself.
I was going to say the store mentioned last in my opinion has the best store bought soda
Im mix of a pop and soda
Coke
as someone whos body reacts with stomach aches and diarrhea to pretty much all artificial sweeteners i will stick with real sugar.....power to those who can drink it i will just have to limit my soda intake (or any other premade drink that ain't just water)
I'm more of a mountain dew guy
When I was in Cub Scouts after we had just moved the the midwest from New York, my dad ordered 10 cases of assorted Soda for the Scout picnic.  When we came to pick it up, they had 10 cases of different brands of "Club Soda".  We should have ordered Pop.
I bet you got your fountain Diet Coke from McDonalds.  McD has their machine set to put slightly more syrup in the mix to account for the ice melt.  I find that at the McD stores that use the Freestyle machines (the ones with 100 flavors) the Diet Coke has an aftertaste that the cans and regular fountains do not have.  Coke Zero in europe does taste better than the US version.
B
...food lion in va too bruh😂
His allegiance was already proven wrong when he said fountain was better than canned
Try diet root beer
i’m a Pepsi all the way
my mom says pop but i say soda
The store I work at has a lot of the glass bottle drinks, including the boylan, iron pig, Mexican coke, and more not so known names. The best I've had has been RC cola and this weird one that has a dark bottle but a colorful label.
Food theory intro is best intro
Diet soda is worse for you than regular... and we all know how bad regular is.
Wow just WOW
Lets hope he loves his wife more then diet coke lol
The ubiquitous manx cumulatively protect because volleyball whitely zip out a royal attention. maniacal, narrow instrument
Who would have known that mat likes his coke 😂😂😂
so here in South Africa we call the generic brand a no-name brand. because places life pick en pay (our Walmart) has no- name on the bottle. and we call pop/soda soda. hope this was at least interesting
I found the Easter egg in the intro just below MacDonald logo before you enter it
B
Pop and I am British
Stevia based drinks are pretty fantastic
Food Lion brand is owned by the Delhaize Group which also owns Hannaford brands up in Maine. I have Hannaford brand diet cola right now actually and the packaging is almost identical to Food Lion. I'm assuming it's probably made at the same place too and then regionally branded.
Matpat were coke
You we're the most seriouse from all the videos on here
Food theory food lion=Harris teeter but Harris teeter has citric acid
Boylan Birch Beer for the winnnn 🤤
Try Fritz-Cola from Hamburg, Germany 👌👌
In Australia we call it soft drink
This is very wierd quitting Diet Coke?!
I love zebra
Real video discription : two crack addicts rank coke
D i say soft drink
Why rock-paper-scissors? Wasn't this to see what Matpats new soda would be?
15:30 I grew up saying pop, but now I saw soda because that’s what it says on the can or bottle.
Sometimes I feel like this channel is just an excuse for mat to eat and drink a bunch of stuff
Im from New Zealand and we call it fizzy
Pop
Don’t drink diet anything. It’s worse for you than non-diet drinks. It makes you crave sugar, but your body never gets it, so you end up eating more junk food to make up for it.
In Oklahoma we say sodapop or pop but calling them all Coke isn't unheard of.
I'm B: Soda cause thats how we Profanitans of Profanaria call it
I want coca cola to say "you've failed me mat pat"
In our country, we call soft drinks 'bottles' in a local accent 'botal' and EVERYWHERE no matter what drink you order, so long as its fizzy, it a 'botal'
A alien has possessed mat pat we all need to run
Wait, does Matt actually have ADHD or OCD? Because his need to control the spotlight makes more sense to me if that's the case. Or maybe they both have difficulties with social cues. They don't know when to take turns when they should actually pile up and add contributions up like verbal ice cream sundaes. You both don't need to feel obligated to speak over each other. Don't take turns, just move on together to a different subject.  - Smith Farcie
I love how Stephanie is so cautious she always talks about all I'm sure it tastes fine I'm sure I'm sure about all the local brands like we're going to get really upset if she calls our local brand garbage we aren't or at least I won't and I'm sure most people wouldn't some people like certain things while others don't all matter of case and taste is always objective
I’m from Cali so soda is called soda or American juice 😂 but I’m a huge Coke Zero fan
Drink the brand Truly
I am a mid west boy,FROM CHICAGO IN FACT! DOWN THERE WE CALL IT "POP"
In the Netherlands here we have fris
It wouldn't surprise me at all if that were relabeled kroger diet soda (big k), because kroger store brand stuff has always been very high quality and delicious, often even better than national brands...and i find this to be true at all of the kroger subsidiaries i have shopped at all over the U.S.  One thing that throws me off, is that when kroger owns a place (like fred meyer, jay-c, fry's, etc...) they tend to have kroger labeled food products throughout.  Fingers crossed though, i really would love to try the harris teeter's, but i live in the Midwest...so hopefully kroger or jay-c is the same thing ?!
There is also a difference between "fountain" and "coke freestyle fountain". Im not sure where your "fountain" contender came from...but i do suspect freestyle because you guys said it was "sweeter". Anyway. The show must go on.
I say fizzy drink
Wait Matpat and Steph live in my home state? Neat
as someone who loves coke zero, i would really like to try harris teeter
over in nz we commonly refer to carbonated drinks as fizzy
The "Big-K" brand, it's long been the best generic soda brand in the US. Not surprising to see it win.
Me: watching this video even though I live in Brazil so half of this drinks aren't even available for me to buy, and also I don't even drink sodas lol
"Which garbage is the best garbage???"
It’s fizzy drink not pop not soda
Wait Dr pepper isn't a cola
Steph was right. Florida is its own thing.
14:30 "Food lion" is powered by large Belgian company "Delhaize Group" that is ~150 years old.  It's kind of company you know, but dont know anything about it.
MatPat: "In all honesty--" The ad that interrupted him: "We love our new home"
I call soda refresco which is spanish duh.
Food Lion Is everywhere that I know of
Why not replace soda with sparkling water like la croix
Everyone knows that one day root beer is the best and cola will fall

diet coke is gross. good for you dont drink that crap.
Kroger brand is just awesome. We buy diet Kroger sodas and really do like them better than national brands.
pop up here in canada
Pop represent! If you call it soda I’ve learned to deal, but if you call it soda pop, get out.
Us folk in England call it fizzy drink well soft drink but fizzy too or maybe that's just me.
Swap Publix for HT diet cola... Harris teeter has the best flavor.
I grew up in the middle of nowhere but we called them "sody pops"
you missed freeway diet cola
Diet Pepsi is the only cola what I will drink.
Store brands ftw
Harris teeter supremacy!!!
Here in Michigan we call it pop
Im addicted to Coke Zero I didn’t know I had to watch this vid
Other... It’s just a fizzy drink
Here in Australia, the store brands are quite often as good as or in some cases better than the name brands. not for soda though, they range from fine to complete and utter garbage juice.  some things other Australians may want to try: woolworths chocolate bavarian  coles brand long life milk coles brand instant coffee (not the cheaper one in the tall jar) woolworths mayonais coles brand frozen peas and corn (not a store brand but) One night in mexico kits/sauces/spice mixes  I may add more as they come to mind.
Should... should someone tell him about the... chemicals in them?
Matpat- boylan has been true to their original recipe for more than a hundred years. Me- oh so it has cocaine in it then.

Idea : a my singing monsters theory.  Please
wtf is diet pepsi cafine free? that shits called pepsi max
Here in Australia we call it soft drink
how did he not get faygo
Next theory: What are Dr Pepper's 23 flavors? Get on it, MatPat!
I'm a little bit puzzled by this episode.  I'm I'm a long time drinker of soft drinks (what we call soda or pop in NZ). In this country, Coca Cola market 3 main sugarless versions of Coke. Your episode only lists the first two.  Diet Cola has been around for decades Coke Zero was the new age replacement but is incredibly watery and bears only a passing resemblance to Coke. Coke No Sugar is the latest iteration.   I've always hated Diet Coke as it tastes like the aluminum tin has been blended into the liquid. Granted the bottle version is less obnoxious.  According to my cousin, Coke zero has been discontinued in Australia however its still readily available here in NZ.   Coke No Sugar is probably the closest taste-wise to Coca Cola. Most people I know including myself consider it the coke of choice. Of course, where possible, I try to support the local brand (L & P No Sugar... and no its not a cola).
I prefer calling it attack helicopter matt But uhhh coke is fine
For the record, Zevia is sodium-free and tastes much better with some salt/electrolytes added.
Who’s gonna let MattPatt know that most of the east coast has Food Lion?
You got a bad bottle of Boylan's. I've never thought that it tasted or smelled like cough syrup.
1:54 "My allegiance is to the diet coke republic! To democracy!"   Anyone who understood that reference is a legend.
Qustion of the day will he stop drinking diet coke????????????????????
I'm soda

I don't drink diet coke but my dad is addicted to it.  To save money he started drinking Kroger diet coke.  I don't drink much soda personally, but I always thought Kroger had good soda
You know that mat pat was SERIOUS about loving the harris teeter diet cola because he was doing the "hands thing" where he moves his hand up in down while explaining something.
MatPat should order 12 Big macs and a single diet coke.
Omg
watching this video I noticed PEPSI was in the... bracket? but I HATE PEPSI SOOOOOOO MUCH THAT I WOULD THROW IT ALL AWAY INTO THE SUN AND HAVE COCA~COLA AS #1 FOR EVERY GENERATION OF OUR LIVES!!!!!
They're both drinking so many different diet cokes that they might actually gain superpowers or some chizz. 😅
I'm 13 and I have an addiction to Coke ZERO. I drink without guilt.
Living in the south and having spent a good amount of my formative years spent around my grandmother from Minnesota and my first few years of life spent in the northwest have me saying soda and pop interchangably.
i recommend diet irn bru, it's a scottish drink so you probably wont be able to get your hands on it especially with covid
I've always just called them soft drinks
I, am an Indian, so here its a mix between coke and soda
My grand parents say pop but i grew up with soda
Here's a pro gamer tip:  just stop drinking soda.  I stopped a few years back and recently I tried it again and I hated it.  It's a win win all around:  no sugar over load, less caloric intake, less chance of kidney stones, less money spent.
I call it fizzy drink. I’m from London
B
Good idea from me Water it good for U health cause ye
I just love how Matt looks and sounds like a " Coke " addict throughout the video .
D: Water cuz I don’t drink Fizzy drinks :)
I binged on diet coke for months and lost so much weight. Not the healthiest way, but the carbonation kept me from over eating.
Whats funny about this is i shop at payless. I was diagnosed diabetic last year and since have switched to either diet or zero pops. I definitely perfer the payless branded "cola ohhh" over both Pepsi zero and coke zero.
Can anyone confirm if King Soopers is getting the same soda? I drink Diet Coke all the time and was wondering but will have to wait for another time to go check it out.
soda from the fountain is always better than in the can or bottle. seems pretty unfair to compare fountain diet coke to bottled/canned other drinks
on the first one they forgot glass bottle diet coke
I am English, we don't tend to use pop or soda. Honestly everyone I know just says "something fizzy", but the official term is soft drink.
In Australia we either call it soft drink or less used fizzy drink.
I didn’t realize you were also a North Carolinian
Boylan’s cream soda is killer! It’s really good .
Wh-wh-whaaaaaaaaat???
Go to poland find lemon diet cola you will never go back to regular cola
In Australia, we call it Soft Drink XD
I’m in uk so we usually say fizzy drink.
That's all well and good Matt, but we all know that if you go out to eat, or travel, you are still gonna be getting that sweet Diet Coke.
I used to work for Harris Teeter. Great grocery store, fantastic prices, and I was so glad to see that it won this little competition.
In Britain, we call them either fizzy or soft drinks
Fizzy drinks
Better Choice:   Don't drink  "Diet"  Sodas......  if going to drink soda, just go with regular stuff?  The fake stuff in "Diet" if anything is worse for you and not any better. (and ya know, there is Sprite.  lmao)
AYE WE LIVE IN THE SAME STATE :D
Sans is Ness will always be canon in my soul.
I grew learning the word "soda" and I'm from Texas. Just curious, anyone here in the comments, born and raised, from Texas, what carbonated drink terminology do you learn?
My connecticut/pennsylvanian upbrnging has always called it Soda. Crazy canuk friends call it pop xD
Fun fact about zero calories. Foods get to advertise as zero calories even if they have calories as long as the amount is small enough. Another factor, the lack of sugars in drinks is commonly swapped with far worse ingredients (like stevia). Only reason to go with a zero callery option is for the marketing.
im so jealous so much soda
Down here in SC you'll be proud to know we've got several food lion's!! 😉 I grew up calling it Soda, and the specific soda by name, although I knew people who call it coke no matter what it is.
anyone know that name of the background song
replace it with regular coke
It's weird to see your mouth move when you talk...
What I am from North Carolina and I thought food lion was world wide
Pop im canadian
Pop and soda
oh my G that Rock Paper Scissors was the best! & 20:30 HER FACE! thats awesome
I am a pop person and actively avoid saying soda!
I'm so mad I can't drink fizzy drinks cuz its really painful on my chest
😂😂STOP LYING! Diet coke is like Fnaf in a drink for you!
Shoutout harris teeter
I call Soda.... Soda.
Why are ya'll drinking soda out of sweet tea cups!?
in ireland its called a fizzy drink
I can totally vouch for the Kroger thing. I work at Kroger, so K soda is the exact same as Harris's and Ralphs. Btw, their version of Mountain Dew is so so so much better, and probably better for you, than the actual name brand.
I never knew Harris teeter was only a thing here. I knew Food Lion was but oof. I thought HT was in SC and GA.
Now Matpat is going to stalk Harris Teeter instead of coke cola in his videos as he found his brand new drug of choice
While being in Europe (Finland, to be specific) and things being little different when it comes to these things, I gotta go with Steph on this one for Coke Zero!
boylan is pretty good but ive never tried the diet sodas
we say cola like KOLA
In Germany we got a very delicious Cola Brand called „Fritz Cola“ if u wanna try some international Sodas. Just search for „Zuckerfrei“, it‘s German for Sugar free ;)
Shoudnt this be a drink theory
So I'm not the only one that has noticed that different sources have different flavors! I love my fountain Dr pepper too! Wax paper cup. Has to be wax paper cup
Pepsi Max here for me and there is NO replacement, there's something about Pepsi max that I don't get with any other coke
what do i do if i live in japan please respond thx
In the Philippines, we call them softdrinks and we drink them in plastic bags (the vendor pours the contents of the glass bottle into a plastic sandwich bag and we drink thru a straw)
Now we just have to wait for Matt to put a soul in his new can...
Betrayed.
Imagine if this video was sponsored by Coca Cola 😂
I live in NYC and it seems that the closest Kroger subsidiary to me (other than a surprising number of Fred Meyer jewelry stores scattered throughout NY and NJ) are Harris Teeters in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Guess it’s gonna be a while until I get to try that soda but until then, I’m definitely gonna start scouting out generic grocery store brands to find some hidden gems
I would actually recommend the boyland birch beer soda
If you like the fruity twist of Harris Teeter, you should try Spiffy Cola.
It's soda you crazys
I am very behind the idea of this competition, and fully stand behind fountain diet coke as being the obvious contender among the other DCs; however, I do not feel that it is a fair competition or fair comparison if you only compare fountain DC to other colas only in bottles and cans. Fountain pop (specifically fountain DC) will always be superior to any other vehicle of pop delivery and so fountain DC will be the clear winner. But hey, that's just a theory... A FOOD THEORY!
i am also from the Midwest pat and everyone i know is team soda
Zero surger gateregg
As a Georgian with a Food lion less than a mile from me, I'm offended.
Here in va, everybody goes to food lion
I'm a soda
We call it softdrinks in Philippines
All diet soda sucks change my mind
Wasn't a fan of Zevia at first but its all about the ingredients in my case who wants to drink an healthier soda life, after a week or two i got used to it, i tried back other options and they are much too sweet for me now. There is no turning back now.
I'm soda xD
I'm South African but live in New Zealand and my family calls things just "fizzy drink"
You live in NC and your favorite soda isn't CheerWine? As someone that can't get CheerWine where I live This angers me. Diet Cola is nasty.
Virgils is good and not bad
D:other: Is Pepsi okay
Fountain drinks typically put more sweetener in their drinks ^^ fun facts. Companies do it to make it more addictive to customers to make em keep coming back.
The Soda Pop Kid Little Big Man  Soda Pop for me lol
Try bubly
stop drinking soda and drink whisky
10:25 And OF COURSE you'd buy into the ridiculously bullshit anti-science conspiracy theories around Aspartame... -_-
Pop
soda
uhhh cola
Honestly alot of Kroger brand products are better or just as good as the big brand foods.
Born in Indiana, raised in Montana...I call it Soda Pop 🥤☺️
North Carolina supermarket cola > North Carolina soda company
Why diet soda or as we call it in Britain pop
I work for what we call a "co-manufacturing" plant.  We make meat snacks, more specifically Slim Jim brand snack sticks.  We also supply several private labels as well.  So your end of the video comments about similar recipes, yes.  For sure.  #confirmed
Solution don’t drink soda. I haven’t had any soda since the pandemic
As a fellow Ohioan its an easy A. Pop
Try the guarana zero (brazilian soft drink)
Every normal person on earth thinks diet coke tastes just as bad as anything else you made faces over
I like Pepsi while Americans love Coke more than any Other Soda
I say pop. There ya go. No one cares.
F**k, i am from india and today in my 19year old life i got to know that cola is a flavour and not the name of cocacola thanks food therory for this fact i think
Aren't they aware that originally Cola was supposed to be a medicine against headaches? It isn't that surprising that the brand that didn't change the recipy for 100 years tastes like cough sirup.
23:03 I would, but I'm Canadian.
18:55 You know you've been together too long when:   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
18:03 Voice over says "13th seed" visual says "10th seed."
In Canada, it's pop.
10:58 Yes. Because there aren't tiny cans of Coke and Pepsi...
Something that has always amused me... Coke > Pepsi but Diet Pepsi > Diet Coke
4:11No glass bottle?
1:24 *Coach Greg has entered the chat*
My Coca-Cola of choice is and wil always be Cola Zero!😍😍😍 Argh... I love it🥰
Bepis ? (NOT PEPSI >:C)
"citric acid runs the world and we dont even know it" ever heard of the krebs-cycle?
I could not imagine betraying Diet Coke by replacing it with another diet soda. -_-' Bottle Diet Coke FTW (for me anyway) Canned Soda tastes like the can and Fountain is normally either to sweet, not sweet enough or flat.
Coke Zero actually has sugar, not a lot but it does
my grandmama planted stevia in her backyard...... she introduced me to the sweet leaves during a lovely holiday when I was 7 years old, a week later she found the stevia plant RAVAGED and completely leafless, I wonder what did such a thing......
Yo, Food Lion is a Belgian supermarket chain. It's not some local North Carolina chain :)
Matap is the host so 2 vote
In our location, we call them "soft drinks"
Recently i was also searching for a non acidic, no caffeine diet soda. Because water is just too boring, I really need flavor.
D:
I’m commenting
I’m not crying 😭
Diet coke is owned by coca cola
I’m a diet soda fan as well. I’m specifically particular about diet Mountain Dew, but I am confident that I could identify the difference between can, bottle, and fountain cola. Lol
I'm :coke and pop
In New Zealand we call it fizzy or fizzy drink
Fly diet kidzee
I wish he didn’t SPOIL OTHER EPISODES
POP!!!
:c
Diet sodas have aspartame, a chemical which can damage eyesight. Go and research it. I would suggest drinking regular sodas.
I have an unpopular opinion, i like both coke and meth (coca cola and pepsi)
I call it both, soda-pop
If DIET COKE makes him this insane, imagine him drinking Mt. Dew. Umm. Also you guys got soda? I got water.
.
15:30 Pop all the way. Canadian answering.
aspartame makes me physically ill.
I've always said Soda, and my favorite soda is Cherry Coka Cola :)
I've always used "pop" when referring to soda in general.
MatPat, just admit it. You hate Diet Pepsi.
i LOVE DIET COKE TOO
Yes Boy yes
19:27 why did Steph's eyes have a spiral in them? Little confused, but then again, soda
the true underdog hero story: harris teeter cola
dude i live right next to both harris teeter and food lion
I like coke and coke
15:30 botal dont ask
Soda gang
You also sort of spoiled yourselfs by revealing what each one was as it won. Except for the diet coke, which you obviously know by heart, you should have kept all the others secret  until the final winner was chosen.
No coasters? Come on, guys.
I'm in New Jersey, grew up here and we always say B. Soda. Love me some Soda. XD
Not being able to taste the difference between aspartame and Splenda should disqualify all your tastings.
How about some high quality h20?
i call it fizzy pop, pop, or soda, or peppy
Pepsi.
Just started drinking Cherry Dr. Pepper Zero...and it Rocks
I think the reason most of the ones you didn’t like were gross was because they were diet. If they were normal cola flavored I bet most wouldn’t be so bad (also as a person born and raised in Ohio, we all call it pop)
At this point mat loves Diet Coke more than Stephanie lol
Pro tip: all soda is trash
15:30 soda
In England we call soda, fizzy drinks.
at least it's not diet pepsi
Really appreciated the inclusion of Fountain soda vs canned soda since fountain soda is WILDLY superior in taste
Whait is coke reely root beer whith cafine
I’ve won, but at what cost?
My personal top 3 list (I have, of course, a smaller basis for comparison ): 1. Pepsi Max 2. Coke Zero 3. Diet Coke / Diet Pepsi (draw) The store brands in my region are awful imho.
Dang. I don’t drink Diet Coke at all.
all ive heard is ether soda, drink, or fountain drink :^
I stand with your wife on this. Wait that sound wrong when i put it like that. Moral of the story she is right you are wrong XD Coca Cola zero is best
i call it pop sometimes soda
POP
rip matpat's obsession for diet coke, at least he got another drug to obsess on i guess
Coke Zero is the best.
why am i watching this, im a european who only drinks water XD
Food lion is not North Carolina based as such, it's a Belgian company
In Australia we call them soft drinks or fizzy drinks.
I like Pepsi
I'm surprised you didn't try Diet RC Cola, love Royal Crown
D:other in australia it is soft drink and i call it that
I am proud to say I’m a pop man myself
Good old rock. Nothing can beat that.
Coke Zero
I call it Coke, me and my dad are from Nevada
We have fizzy drinks in NZ
I say Sodi Pop like a true moron. Thanks dad.
Im still wondering why they needed a straw for this episode that I couldn’t sit through 🙄 do you two not kiss? Why does it matter if u both put your lips on the same glass? R u that afraid of covid or something? I know y’all live in Cali where their views are particularly skewed from the rest of the country with common sense but come on 😂
As a Northeasterner, I have to go with soda being the best way to call a flavored bubbly drink
As a South Carolinian, the nearest Harris Teeter is in Columbia, but seeing this hyped up makes me really want to try this. Welp, time for a 45 minute trip just for some store brand diet cola.
Generic brand is 9 times out of 10 better than brand name food and drink. Brand names know people are buying the name, not the product. Why should they put pricier ingredients into their products when they could just spend the bare minimum and still turn a huge profit? Generic branding has a reputation for not being as good so most people pass it by without much thought. Idk if big brands actually use mediocre ingredients, but from an economic standpoint there is really no reason to try too hard - your total shock at how good your store's Generic soda is is a testament to how easily brands we don't know as well get passed over. I love Generic! It's the same or better for less money, can't go wrong.
I love how this video has 3M views..
The first mistake was choosing a diet soda over a regular soda
You are not in the south!
Nothin beats birch beer specifically the one served at the Farm Table owned by Kringle Candle company. It took me 2 hrs to remember where this was because I didn't remember the name, just the fact there was a red rooster statue in front which complicated things so much further.
Matpat, I think you should venture into the world of Root Beer taste testing after this episode. X'D  P.S. I am in North Carolina.
Seems Harris teetered to the top
Wise words, but does that also mean we don't start a badass YouTube channel (s)?
Here in Spain we call EVERYTHING Coca-Cola.
Crystal Pepsi did not exist in the 80's
I’m from the south. My father worked at Food Lion when he lived in North Carolina. All of the local restaurants you mention in your videos I’m very familiar with. (cook out is a favorite of mine) It’s good to see a youtuber finally recognize the south and the amazing barbecue we got 😌
Me and my family did taste tests with generic vs name brand chips, and we were surprised to also found out that the generic was just as good, if not better
what did I just watch
In Scotland everything is juice. Coke=Juice, Irn Bru=Juice, OJ=Juice
I can relate I can drink three 2L of cola in a day
Here's the real test. Chug it. Many things taste great when you are taking a bit of it, but getting in multiple bites, gulps, or mouthfuls the flavor changes, and what once you thought was amazing is now making you vomit. Chug 1 can and then chug two and see if you still like it. That should be the real tie breaker . . . in my opinion.
💎👄💎
You missed glass bottle diet coke which is up there with fountain imo
I think food lion is owned by a belgian company named Delhaize (i know because of the logo which is exactly the one we have here in european stores). Where i live (serbia) we have a store owned by that company called Maxi.
There's this great calorie, sugar free cola here in Norway. It's called Grans Cola X, and it's half the price or less than regular Coca Cola
D: Fizzy
You missed Rola cola
0:15 MP 4 matpat
Napoje
At least you'll be saving money buying supermarket own brand over coke
C. Coke
How to replace diat coke? It's simple drink tea. Tea is so good. And are so many kinds that you can't get bored ever for drinking tea.
for anyone wondering about the health of diet soda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKciZz3hfVc&t=204s <-  this video is quite good
14:04 nooo way he be hitting his couch
You quit Diet coke,Good for you.
This is literally Cody ko and Kelsey if they were married and spent their lives talking about game theories
This man had ALL of the diet sodas at his fingers..and he chose KROGER.
ur wife is hot
No caffeine free diet coke?
B
Soda pop
i love Zero from Borderlands that was an amzing reference
Coming from Florida, we just call it soft drink or soda. I don't know where all this "coke" stuff is coming from
drink some regular soda my dude, it can't be healthy what they do to the soda to make it "diet" pepsi is awesome but thats biased
here in Michigan you can still get crystal Pepsi. and i love it
Yeah I don't call it soda or pop anytime I'm at a fast-food joint I'm just like man can I get a drink with that
Harris teeter is in South Carolina
They are all called Fizzy and anything else is incorrect
diet products (soda) has aspertame. this is a sugar substatute that is known to actually be a poison in large amounts. and while the amount in diet coke seems small the amount consumed is massive over just 1 year. that said go with root beer
Citric acid is something im allergic to i barely am tho I Just get a rash and lose like 3 weeks of my life
There is a foodlion in Virginia
This is the moment when Asta become the wizard king
diet coke more like... idk
i call it soda
i like shasta the most 1 for its price and 2 because its the  of the only 1 of 2 off brand sodas where i live that has the best taste for off brands
Them: Let’s try to be as scientific as possible, also Them: play rock, paper, scissors  *That escalated quickly*
D as in Utah more specifically in the salt lake valley there are 6 or 7 commonly used terms for soda they are as follows pop in old breakfast sit downs, soda at supermarkets, soda pop at small diner changes, coke at restraints sit down, Pepsi also at sit down restraints, soft drink at fast food, and fizzy pop which is a brand that has its own nickname for it's soda. personally though I use soft drink most often.
We call it pop here in Ohio.
In soviet Russia, Diet Coke qvits you!
In Scotland, it's "fizzy juice"
19:05 Yeah no... they're DEFINITELY married XD Steph KNOWS what's up
I havent watched yet, but I am betting that he chooses diet coke
Diet coke might be "a little unhealthy" but don't forget, normal coke and other soda are extremely unhealthy! so people who are not able to wean off soda, should still drink the diet option.
I actually quit coke/Pepsi . I was addicted. I had so much cavities. The pain of the numbing needle made me wake up and quit sugar. I haven’t had it in months. Skin is happy, body is happy..........teeth is happy
A/B because we use Soda in our county in Wisconsin but in the U.P. of Michigan EVERYONE uses pop. Got used to both
Coke Zero is indeed the best diet soda I've ever had.
As people of science I'm surprised you chose the one that is a variable in and of itself was chosen to be the standard to compare against lol
Since the Harris Teeter is the only one with citric acid, if you find a store brand diet cola with citric acid, it's most likely going to be the same. I checked ingredients lists for every chain I can find here. Aldi's summit diet cola contains citric acid, but it's got a different preservative, less sodium and ingredients are in a different order. So it's clearly different, but might be similar.
ice cold diet pepsi out the bottle. With ice cubes if in a cup.  and it's soda in SC. No one says pop or coke unless you want a coke.
Diet coke vs Harris teeter vs coke zero was like Hayama vs Kurokiba vs Souma in Food Wars. Two powerhouses and an underdog
Used to live in the west where Smith's was popular, my family would drink an embarrassing amount of big k diet cola. It's always been the best
No offense but I do not like diet coke. I think it has a meh taste but the after taste. That's what does it for me
Mat is just trying to justify the budget cuts
But why only cola tho? Why not other flavor of soda? Fanta?
steph youre cappin im from nc its fucking soda
Nice
I hate Diet Coke and can tolerate  Diet Pepsi but they are both better than Sam's.  The one that really  knocks them all out is BigK from Smith's.  I'm  more of  a  dr. Pepper  guy but even then I'll  take Dr. K over Dr. THUNDER FROM WALMART
food lion use to bleach the meat that was going bad in FL. early 90's
I call it edible acid which tastes good
Pop
Are you diabetic? What is your reasoning for drinking diet over regular?
Aspartame is the most studied substance in the world and the overwhelming consensus is that it's safe. Thew only evidence aspartame is dangerous came from gullible mums forwarding emails to each other.
Soda ofc
I kinda feel like this is a really long realistic commercial for all the diet Cokes in south east America
Where is the food theory on cicric acid?
20:00 at this moment he knew he messed up
Born and raised in the midwest.  Everyone but myself calls it pop.  Pop is a sound or name for your father.  It is Soda, plain and simple
D: frisdrank 🥤
Brain buster, generic ones are almost always made by the larger companies with exact same ingredients
Sorbete Letelier It’s delicious, it tastes like cherry and each bottle has an actual cherry at the bottom   Make sure to try it if you ever visit Chile
Bit disappointed. There is no food theory in a taste test. I hoped you will compare the sweeteners and ingredients for each coke
Boylan's probably just suffering from a changes in sensibilities
Best soda. Water
Pepsi max is the best coke end of
The real question is, did he quit diet coke? Or did diet coke quit him?🤔
B
Is there a Food Theory on how much plastic is in Matt yet? Then from DC alone?
Your wife looks like a discount Hayley Williams
I only really drink regular soda, but I do have a Pick 'n Save near me.  Might have to try it just in case.
I feel "Fountain" diet coke doesn't pass your criteria because i don't think its as easy to keep at home meaning unless u bought the soda from the supplier u would need to travel whenever u wanted it to get that flavor...
now i want some diet coke lime
POP!!!😉
Food lion has many names in Europe, in Belgium its Delhaize and in Romania ita Mega Image      The more you know
Food theory idea: trying dr. Stones coca cola
FOOD LION COKE IS SO GOOD!!
OMa gosh matpats face im sorry not sorry 12:09
Its really interesting that diet coke is marketed and "designed" for women and coke zero is for men and yet you each prefer the opposite. It's also worth noting the over here in the UK whilst bottled coke's are different the fountain diet coke and coke zero are made from the same syrup. This could be why the coke zero didnt taste as sweet as you were comparing it to the fountain diet coke
drinking cola is gross
A, POP HUNDRED PERCENT
Ima B: Soda
Grew up in the south so I'm a "coke" request person but I've also switched to "soda" in general
What Diet Coke just Coke with extra sugar and two to make it taste different and say it’s Diet Coke
what happens if you grew up with coke, your mom called it pop, and you call it soda
D) Other
Well... guess I am off to Harris Teeter... I will try the zero cola but I'll check out diet Mt Dew facsimile as well as that is my favored soda profile.
SACRILEGE! HERETIC, FACE DESTRUCTION FOR YOUR SINS!
i drink coke zero and i only have like 22 boxes of them in my pantry sooo im not addited right?? right..
It's completely usual, when you drink a lot of coca-cola, then the one with citrus stands out very good for some times like 2-3 days.
You should try Kofola but It is in only Slovakia and Czechia but if you have chance to get it you should try it.
MatPat: Are you soda or pop? Me: I'm literally soda pop
Why am I watching this
Bruh... Coke is one of the worst foods out there. Even "diet"... Try water..
Pop
i'm a coke
What is the difference between diet coke and coke zero?
We call it soda down here in Florida. No one says "coke" when referring to non Coca-cola sodas.
I call it soda and pop but I mostly call it soda bc I live in Columbia, Maryland
Thanks god I dont even drink these that often, I atleast drink it once every month. Water is really tasty for me so why bother drinking other stuff
NANI harris teeter no way
In New Zealand we call it Fizzy drinks or just Fizzy for short.
did he really not try Kofola? omg nooo.. qnp
You can't do this to me, I'm also a diet cola addict (but coke zero is my poison) and now I have to try this but I live in Europe.. AAHHHGFGGH!!!!!
A&W Diet Root Beer hands down
In my country we call soda drinks
FOOD THEORY ON MOUNTAIN DEW!!
I wonder what diet coke tastes like...
Rip I don’t have any of those stores near mw
BREAKING NEWS: coca cola STOPED making diet coke due to the loss of their biggest (and only) customer.
Citric acid: The MSG of sweet foods
It’s coke man. Not soda
I'm from Texas so I call everything Coke
Coke
Pick water. Less chance of kidney stones.
When I was a kid I used to live in North Carolina, Elizabeth City to be exact. I love food Lion and I remember it so vividly as one of the best grocery stores. I live out in California now and I honestly miss it
Coke zero is better, honestly they made it taste exactly like regular coke
IMO id rather no soda to diet soda
Who is this ? 0:16
i hated march mathness the school district march whatever thing
Soft drink
Grew up in MD, so I acually knew all of the grocery brands that you had. As for the name of the drink category? I’m D:Other. My parents being from MI, I called it pop, me growing up in MD, I also called it soda. So, I guess I’m kind of a hybrid?
It’s not a food theory it’s your opinion
So stop making videos like this we only care about theories not opinions
Well there is no winner Because it is all opinion I like coke but that is me that is my opinion so there for there’s no winner like how you guys had different opinions about Coke Zero and hariss teeter
Sales of Krogers diet cola has skyrocketed since this video.
We call it soft drink or coke in Australia
Here in Florida we say soda
Just drink water
as soon as mat mentioned crystal pepsi i had a flashback and i immediately went to watch this videos "Enjoying A 20 Year Old CRYSTAL PEPSI (WARNING:VOMIT ALERT)" WOW that give me 2013-4 vibes
Food Lion has 1,100 stores across the east coast.. not just North Carolina lol  Edit: also kinda think harris teeter and food lion are all under the same parent company Ahold-delhaize alone with bloom and kroegers etc
Rock rock rock rock rock paper
soda  XD and i was drinking diet coke
duuuude i'm belgian and you showed "food lion", I looked at the logo and I was like "wait this is Delhaize, wtf?" and boiii, it belongs to the delhaize group hahaha the more you know.
In Ireland we say coke
Tbh I thought he was gonna talk about the aspartame but... Congrats?
23:00 pretty sure none of these are by me
18:30 good old rock, nothing beats that XD
Glad you did some of the regional chains. As a Georgian people need to know more about small southern chains before they move here
This explains why big K soda from Smith's was also so good.
pop
PEPSI MAX is the best diet cola ever!!!!
WHY WAS I ROOTING FOR A DRINK!!!!
Here in Australia, we say fizzy drink or just fizzy
Harris Teeter is what happens when you invite a secretly OP no-name to the tournament arc
We Australians actually call it 'Soft Drink' weird I know, but to be honest I like the sound of Pop.
10:23  Diet Pepsi may not be good for your Body but its Good for your Soul.
Wait is this game theorist
canned coke zero is my favorite
Yo I used to work for coke and I can confirm we still called it coke zero, not coca-cola zero sugar lol
"food lion, which you've probably never heard of." Excuse me, matpat. As a winston-salem native, I know my way around a food lion.
Soda's are so last century. Sparkling flavored water is where its at. What the difference is, I have no idea.
It's pop
Was that song in the beginning the hayabusa noob song?
I just drink orange crush
pop
The majority of people call carbonated beverages fizzy drinks in the UK, the shops and supermarkets label those sections as fizzy drinks too.
I live in New Mexico and always referred to dark soda's as Coke and everything clear is 7-Up. lol.  You can be offered a Coke at someone's house and they may bring you Root Beer, Dr Pepper, Pepsi, or maybe even a real Coca Cola.  If you are picky about your soda choices, you get used to asking "what kind of Coke?"
If this is true im unsubscribing. STAY ON YOUR DIET (coke) KEEP ON CHUGGING DIET
Hey Matt I truly hope you see this try and find Coke Zero it tastes just like that coke taste but 0 calories and 0 sugars
diet coke is fucking disgusting. I haven't met a single person who ever likes them
As a worker for Meijer I cannot shop at Kroger.
All cokes have citric acid
D: Fizzy.
Food theory: We made our own coke
D: Other In the UK, it's fizzy drink.
Intern working at the company of the winning diet coke: Hey guys cancel all those marketing expenses, we just got a BIG score of an endorser. :D
I must say, it would have been more interesting if this were done blind.
Greetings from Germany. If you are about to visit us here, try Fritz Kola and Vita Cola.
Coke and soda I am the southern kid. YEEH HAH!
I’m in wv and I have like 8 food Lions
E. Lemonade
it's soda. OR! soft drink. pop is dirived from 'soda pop' but in my younger years everything was coke.
Seeing how perfect Matt's wife is, both in terms of personality match, and just objectively speaking, makes me realize how lonely I am. I need to get out there. I'm a good looking successful nerd. Apparently that's in high demand. Let's get this done.
I am soft drink
Soft drink mate
D. Other I call it fizzy (British). :)
17:05 No offense/disrespect to mat and hope I’m not breaking the bro code But did anyone else find it kind of attractive that steph guessed the ingredient?  It is it just me ? Like oh 👀
Dude you live in NC so do I
In Australia we don't say any of those, we just say "Soft Drink", this can be a cola or lemonade or anything
Here every cold drink is called pepsi.
15:30 I was C: coke as a kid in TX. Even in highschool I'd be like "hey, wait for me by the Coke machines after school". As an adult I became B: Soda, but my inner Texan absolutely CANNOT STAND hearing someone call it "pop"  *me physically shuddering because even typing it just feels wrong*
@FoodTheory, I 💯 agree with you about the difference in flavor depending on the source of the drink (04:14). I have very strong feelings about the superiority of canned Dr Pepper above all other Dr Peppers. It's too foamy from a plastic bottle, and the can keeps it cool longer. And it actually tastes better straight from the can! It's insane because most canned drinks and beers have a weird metallic taste that ruins your drink. Anyway, I know I'm a month late to the party, but I just thought I'd throw in my little 2 cents.
Soda
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE SAID THAT!!!!!! HE LEFT DIET COKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coke : born and raised in Northwest Louisiana
I had to give up pop and switch to water. Now I only drink Fiji with lemon juice added. I only get diet pop with take out foods if I can't get coffee or a mocha. Life is simply not meant to be enjoyed. 😥     I wouldn't be surprised about Kroger, their self-rising crust frozen pizzas are better than name brand ones! Kroger is top notch as a supermarket.
Now
DR pEpper
Haha. Yall know you are on the same wavength when you cant beat each other at RPS in 6 rounds
B
Soda
I live in the south but I’m the only one in my family who says soda
No WONDER krogers is better
I heard coca-cola has filed for bankruptcy,  coincidence? I think not.  I love Diet Dr. Pepper
what about the wings video?
I was rooting for Harris Teeter just for the lolz and I am shocked
This hurt
before i watch, i just want to say, Diet Dr, Pepper is the best diet soda I've had yet.
I'm with Steph
Soda but from mid west
The fact that I know all of these is sad
Mathew pathew how could you use straws after the wall-e episode how could you use a straw you just added a variable that changes the flavour and depends on what temperature you have it at also adds another variable.
The diet soda gods sent you the Harris teeter diet soda like a gift. IT WAS A GIFT FROM THE DIET SODA GODS!!!!!!
Pepsi Max > all shitty coke products.
coke
What a plot twist :O
MatPat and Steph might not finish off each other's sentences but could go on indefinetly in Rock, Paper, Scissor XD
Never heard of food lion? You fool I work at a food lion!
Why does only coke get the fountain clause?
Non diet coke
we just call them fizzy drinks here in New Zealand
Can I drink diet coke I'm 13
Soda is bad for you. End of the story. I just saved you a few minutes of your life.
“You’ve probably never heard of Food Lion”  *Me, who worked there for a year*: 0__0
If you lived in Australia you would probably get frozen (diet) Coke in the tournament
15:33 Me: ‘Fizzy Drink’
You miss trader Joe's and whole foods
idk if this normal im aussie i just call it drink
I am läsk which is swedish for soda
I'm D, other. I call it a fizzy drink, as I was raised to.
I can watch this forever 😀
Soda
I thought Diet Coke was gonna win
3:44
It’s weird to see that voice coming out of a moving mouth 🤣
its 5am wtf am i doing
About different sources having different flavors, I dont know that, but different sizes of bottles can have different ingredients, I saw that in Pepsi 3l having different sweeteners than Pepsi 1l, I am talking about zero version.
You can have a healthy soda, just DIY, put the flavors and use stevia for sweet flavor
Answering the question at 15m30s, here in southwest Canada we tend to call carbonated soft drinks "pop" for short.  Calling them all "coke" is just weird.  Although I've also witnessed locally a family who just uses the term "coke" to refer to all soft drinks when talking with their young children, and they didn't get it from the southern US, but rather because Coke is a general favourite and saying say brown coke or orange coke etc was a simpler explanation for young children.
I knew he was southern
In ME they call all carbonated beverages Cokes
B
SODA
Seems like craft cola is just as shitty as craft beer.
THIS MAN NEEDS TO TASTE 7UP AND TASTE THE GLORY WITH IN IT *by 7up i mean 7up free*                          POPOPOPOPOP pop is good
What's better for you? Diet Coke or Coke Zero?
I’m pop down in England
In Oklahoma it was pop and soda  In Texas it was just soda
to be honest me and my brother call it fizz/fizzy
Do u think the secret ingredient in mr krabs krabby patties could be citric acid?
C:It’s coke here in Texas
If there's one thing I've learned from watching the blind taste tests from GMM, it's that Kroger brand foods are goated. Not surprised to hear your favorite is also from Kroger
Regarding what we call it: around here everything is limo, whether it has lime in it or not. It doesn't have to be an extra long car either.
I dont see why anyone drinks diet sodas over normal soda, given that diet soda has essentially been proven to be no better for you. You're basically suffering that chemical aftertaste for nothing! Also, wheres the Faygo?! The Juggalos are gonna be _pissed_
D we call it fountain drinks
It's pop for me
diet thumbs up is an indian soda its  [ redacted }
I’m in the south, it’s all coke.
Just saying, flavoured waters pretty good
Hey sooooo I drink zevia because I got use to it since my dad drinks it.  It is actually better that normal soda now but you just have to get use to it. It taste better overtime
If I ever find myself in NC I'm definitely getting some Harris Teeter
boylan is trash!
Here in England the Diet Coke recipe is the Worst! Pepsi max destroys all competitors here. Aldi’s 42p cola zero or something is a hidden gem 🥸
I always called it like sody so-ti i know im weird
Fountain sodas always taste not like the original sodas to me. They usually taste like the other sodas leaked in to it somehow. And they taste more watery. I’m surprised that Matt chose the fountain version over a bottle or can
Diet Coke is trash I’m addicted to Vanilla Coke diet sodas taste like 💩
Funny how you mentioned the sans is ness theory, that was the first thing to pop up in the recommended on this video for me
Hi
i grew up with it being coke in texas lol
tu kola from cuba is much better
What about diet Dr Pepper
Funny because I drink Coca Cola Zero a lot and it taste almost exact to Coke Diet.
im shookith
I'm Canadian, we call it pop :D
Nix exists but it is coke but from Uruguay (I think it came before coke)
OMG WHY IS THIS IN MY WATCH LATER!!?!?!
I have a British family so we call it fizzy
DIET RC
Btw, not surprised with Kroger. I’m considering moving north of Florida because I prefer the Kroger Key Lime pie to everyone else. It smells and taste more like key limes. Which is weird because key limes are from Florida.
grew up saying pop but recently i started saying soda
How did a geek like you get such a beautiful wife like her? ;)
As much as I appreciate MatPat wanting to find a Diet Coke alternative, I will like to mention that Diet Coke has artificial sweetener and too much salt that is bad for you. Mat, just give up the soda please. 🥺
Y’all should do a theory about what makes Chicken Express’s sweet tea soooo good! And also Cane’s sweet tea. I can’t find anything on what/ how much sugar they put in it.
bbbrrruuuuhhh you live in north carolina?? I live in Fayetteville
B
D: soft drink
Wait look for the oreo in the street in the intro their is someone under it
Matpat is a REALLY good arguer
In Australia we all call it fizzy drink
I'm not sure if anyone else has brought this up, but serving temperature makes a big difference in diet colas. generally the colder the better but not to the point of freezing.
FIZZY DRNK GANG RISE UP
Imagine Harries Teeter exploding in profits because of this video and become an international company
8:30 I've never thrown a bottle of soda out, other than boylan cream soda, not a brand I'm a fan of
14:40 Not trying to make anyone bad but pepsi was also based in north carolina, so that mach up was Carolina either way
18:59 😂😂😂 how
I am team D. I call it Erfrischungsgetränk. Its German for Soda
Soda
Manzana sol is a pick I recommend
A: Pop  B: Soda  C: Coke  D: Other ... Me: Seltzer

Top 10 saddest anime betrayals
im all 3
Food lion is great
It’s not fair that you used fountain Diet Coke against bottled diet soda everyone knows fountain is better soda
What about glass bottle Diet Coke
Diet Coke is literally the worst
Coke.
B soda
“ and yes that means that I’ve been eating paint chips all these years”
I have to drink stevia stuff all the time, I feel the pain.
I love my cherry zeiva but I like Frys cherry soda
10:40 d: we called it afepsima if you break it down it is the name for Pepsi because af-(p)epsi- ma
Mat Pat why you like the video you said ness can spell sans??? my mistake his name is sens
Diet Pepsi is the best!
I’m a coke guy
Pop
Okay... forget the Pop/Soda debate. Why in the name of artificially sweetened beverages are you playing paper/rock/scissors with a four count?
YOO FOOD LION REPRESENT I WORK THERE And also used to work at Kroger
HE SAID BIZARRE, WE DID IT. MATPAT MADE A JOJO REFERENCE 12:20
Coke for me
Soda, but “coke” is universal for cola flavors
I found this way to interesting lol
Everything is coke sorry
Meow gib me pop
Support comment
How about TAB ,its an ancestor of Diet Coke..lol
I like diet Pepsi but you said it taste watered down
im D: we call it fizzie
You really should have kept the bracket completely blind to yourselves until the end, you can always tell the audience using editing but while tasting, if you know which is which going in because of some unique flavor profile it kinda defeats the purpose of the taste test being blind at all.
Softdrink?
Australia: Soft drink...
I know that my favourite is neither availible in the US, nor a diet "cola", but a cola/orange mix... But it's my #1 of all beverages... It's only available in germany, austria, and switzerland...and Finnland, somehow. Finnland is at least 2 countries away from Germany...why do they even know about it, if we didn't even know sockerdricka (swedish for: sugar drink, yeah that's the name)
Where is the Pepsi max
0:21
Diet sodas are actually worse than full-sugar sodas, so that is a reason you should quit diet sodas.
Nugget jumping out of the nuggets is the best part of the intro
Soft drink
B: Soda, and I live in Kansas.
Last second pickup bout to bust everyone's brackets.
Soda
Coke
diet dr pepper is superior
I guarantee you whatever's gonna win is whatever has the most sugar/aspartame in it. That's all there is to soda. There's no process, no craft, it's just half a pound of sugar/aspartame in carbonated water and it is pure poison. Both sugar and aspartame are horrible for you, look into it.
Matt, Diet Coke is soooo bad for you!! I'm surprised you don't know about it, look into it.
I grew up where calling everything coke was normal, While I just said soda.
Haha let's all have a coke off 🤣🤣
Diet dr pepper
Sentient Diet Coke can: *Drops bouquet of flowers* " Oh, I see. Ill uhh.. just go. ;-; "
Heck yea! We were defending our store brand the whole time and talking about how we like it much better than the name brands and turns out it is the Kroger Big K Cola Oh! 👏👏👏👏👏🙌
I live in NC as well; and we switched to Harris Teeter zero cola too.   Soooo good.
The ginger root beer zevia tho-
Am i the only one that likes ginger ale
I’m binge watching all of these episodes again, but one thing stuck out to me this go around - the comment about Food Lion being unheard of. XD I grew up in an area of southern Maryland that easily had three different Food Lion’s within 20 minutes of my house, lol! No shade for MatPat though, I know he’s not from the East Coast! XD
Matpat: Diet Kroger Cola man
Oh, yeah, I forgot Steph was a biology major!
It’s all coke
Mapat:you probably never heard of food lion  The entire state on Virginia:are you sure about that?
B: Soda
where. do I purchase. the red. jacket
18:10
For me Diet Coke and regular coke taste the same
Food Lion...brings back memories
Harris Teeter's stock has gone up by 1000%.
Idk I hate diet soda lmao idk why I wasted my time watching this
As an NC native, it’s so weird to hear places like cookout and food lion as “regional”, when there are like 10 of each of those within 50 miles of me 😂
🤯🤯🤯
I can't stand diet sodas. The artificial sweetener tastes.. weird.
I live in the South, but always been a "soda" person myself. It's mostly cause I can't stand coca cola, diet or otherwise. Its my most despised soft drink. So calling wonderful soft drinks like Dr. Pepper and Root Beer "coke" always felt like sacrilege to me.
I say soda sometimes but at other times I say pop
19:00 OMG you two are adorable.
A popp
pop
B!  SODA!  My grandma uses both soda and pop, though.
i have watched this vid more than 10 times, this is his best vid on the food channel
1:02 matpat is like dont tell my secrects
The 13th seed haris teeter but it's 10th seed on the screen
I'm more of a pop man myself. I grew up in Indiana, so it would make sense
Never heard a man explain his choice soda with such passion.
We had Food Lion where I grew up in Florida back in the day, but they went out of business from their questionable food practices. I was surprised they still exist.
Coke born in raised in texas
Why was the brand revealed in the first round?
Diet Rite is easily the best option listed
Food lion isn't really a regional store per say. There sister store in the north is hannaford and both are owned by a german company. That's why they can go agents the big hitters.   Source: I worked there for years
https://youtu.be/yDgfGXZh958
I call it Fizzy Idk why but everyone understands so Im just used to it
diet coke how do you feel about loosing $1,000,000,000 in revenue
Try Boylan Dark Cherry. Its the only soda I drink.
i'm other, i say dr pepper
Just a small tidbit to add onto the video, but at 23:14 when MatPat shows the logos of all the Kroger-owned supermarkets, the logo for Pay Less isn't actually the right logo! The logo shown is actually for another 'Pay-Less' supermarket that's only on Guam, one of the U.S.'s island territories. And as far as I can tell, they are not owned by Kroger, either.
Dr k brand is the exact same flavor you described as your favorite it's like a weaker cherry flavor coke to me
Gotta hop on that side by side comparison myself now. Gotta see for myself.
Try diet Dr Pepperor or diet green citrus teas I know it’s not a cola but try it
Meanwhile, I'm over here disliking diet soda, and especially Diet Coke... way too many memories of being stuck drinking room-temperature Diet Coke because my grandparents on my dad's side only drank that... :(
Tried the Big K from Food 4 Less, as a regular Coke guy, this was totally acceptable and yes, it did have citric acid. 79 cents. Thanks Theorist team!
No, all of those artificial sweeteners are bad for you. They mess with your gut biome. The jury's still out on Stevia.
yep seed 13 Shasta cola is cheap and Shasta means cheap in hindi
Kroger Root Beer is fantastic, and upended all other root-beers for me.  Big K Root Beer is watered down moose urine.
I miss Cheerwine so much, I find it soemtimes on the west coast.
Grew up in the Midwest, so it's always going to be pop to me. And now I'm really super curious if Harris Teeter will ship pop!!  Probably not so I guess I'll have to check Kroger! You really peeked my interest, though, and I don't like diet anything! Lol!
c: coke
Pop
Harris Teeter after this: *stonks*
Gotta try coke light from the UAE
Just add a zest of citrus lol!
I'm a coke guy
i hate Pepsi it's sugar and gass
Yous not got pepsi max in the US? That's my personal addiction drink.
please drinking cola for 7 years destroyed my teeth now half of my behind tooth are gone
So far, Coke Zero can't be beat for me!
From the south, so its either a lower case C coke (Coke is the brand), or a "coldrank"/"cold drink", which is always a soda, usually canned. Never juice/tea/water/hard drink.
Matpat will not stop, until he can legally own a laser gun. And rob every Harris teeter factory on earth, and grab as much cola he can.
Other:dingle berry
"not sponsored by Harris Teeter"
Actually In the law a product can say they have zero calories while actually having up to 5!
I can relate, I used to love Diet Coke but then I found juice 😎
Is it heresy to say I don’t like diet soda.
In NC it is only universally coke if you don't know what coke is. Especially since Pepsi originated in NC.
Did you know... in rock, paper, scissors, most people choose rock first.
Why wasn't caffiene free diet coke in the lineup?
Fruitiness is the key.
This is such an American concept
Clip it
I used to work at a facility that made microwave popcorn and Harris Teeter was one of the brands that we made. It was pretty generic, we would make their popcorn and then change out the boxes and put the exact same stuff into a different brand's box. Kroger had their own formula though and it was VERY distinctive, you could literally tell from over a mile away from the factory if they were making Kroger.
Ayyy Foodlion! I can't really say anything about the drink because I hate both Cola and Diet drinks, but he said we probably don't know Foodlion so I had to come and say other wise
i cant belive it
Me living in Australia calling it "cool drink" 😎
RootBeer Master race unite!
Those Zevia drinks also contain erythritol which has a hard hit to it. I find Stevia drinks that do NOT have erythritol to taste much better and not cause me stomach aches.  It would be more fair If you could find a cola sweetened with Stevia and Monk Fruit and maybe some maple syrup extract flavoring to make up for the brown sugar, and try that!  I'm currently making my own cola with soda stream using those and it works much better!  Unrelated edit?  Kroger diet cola is my favorite diet cola I get all the time here in Michigan.
WAIT. I Just realized that our Theorist messed up: he should have known the scientific fact that the first flavor that touches your taste bud pallet is the one that most people decide they like over any other they taste afterward.  The first flavor acclimatizes your tastebuds and changes them in its favor, SO!  ...  did that mess with this taste  challenge at all?  Also, how are they cleansing their pallet after each drink?  Also, Did he give the full reason why he's quitting diet coke? Was it due to the fact aspartame and other Monsanto diet sweeteners are neuro-toxins and eat holes in our brains or was it another, more Monsanto-friendly reason?
Matpat quitting diet coke? Is it even possible?
Soda Pop 🥤 Sometimes Cola Pop
pepsi max is the diet king.
Diet coke is literally nasty
I personally like Aldi's fizzy cola drink. I'm not sure if in America there are Aldi supermarkets in America but over here in Europe they're everywhere.
I grew up calling everything Coke but now I call them Soda, because that's they right way to label them.😐
Soda
In South Africa drinks are cool-drinks. 😂
How to make a declious  Food Soda Or anything  Critics acid
They are comparing cola products like its wine tasting.
yeahhh we here with the soft drink gang
honestly local grocery chain sodas sometimes end up smacking the hardest man, especially in Texas with HEB
It’s funny I live in Charlotte,Nc and only drink diet soda as well. I loved the video. It’s some that I always wanted to try.
Sodapop is literally one word. It's a choice between Sodapop or Coke. If you say pop or you say Soda you're still saying Sodapop  It's the equivalent of someone's name being Elizabeth and then arguing over if you call her Liz or Beth like they aren't both part of her name.
A bunch of years back, I quit diet coke (and 99% of the diet cola) when I learned what's Aspartame and how it's different from both industrial (high calories) and natural (low calories) sugars. (Which also tells you why it's basically a poison that slowly kills you internally.)
I’m not sure if I should be disturbed or impressed that mat could tell the difference between fountain, can, and bottle just on sight in less than 3 seconds. Especially since you can’t normally see two of them and the other is distorted by the plastic bottle.
In future only the oldest subscribers will remember Matpats diet coke addiction    And soon it will be forgotten ;-;
Up here in the North East US, we call it pop
Big A on the quiz lol
Boylan makes the best grape soda
A bit one sided since you can't get many of the "off brand"  in fountain style.
You should have had a losing bracket so you could  balance it better
Neat, we have Kroger in Michigan... but I'm more interested in Diet Rite now since I prefer sucralose lately.
That rock paper scissors thing was so fucking cute
A
Dude, nobody believed me when i said the various ways you get the same soda all taste different.
go to 3:46 and turn on sub titles LOL
Zero sugar Sprite
Coke Zero is the only answer.
One word rootbeer  It's the nectar of the heavens
I also grew up in Ohio, but my entire (even far extended) family calls it soda. It's really weird because everyone else in the town I grew up in calls it pop, and my family has lived in that area for generations
I quit before you Katt. Matt  Diet Mountain dew try it. Or sprite
I am a coke zero fan.
Im toaster
I’m Minnesotan so POP!!!
We just say "Do you want a drink?" Lol I'm in Florida
b a
You need to tell a story / story about cheerwine... Since it's a carolina sode
You forgot the Mexican glass bottle coke
pop
Jesus I was so invested for the reveal. Glad you found a new favorite! Plus you get to save some money lol
Sodapop
Take your diet soda to the next level with the all new diet diet soda! It's sugar free, it's diet-free, it's clear, it might even cure your ADD and ADHD! That's right! It's... water.
I suggest diet dr pepper
good.  more diet dr. pepper for me.
This is not a theory this is just a fact
A pop
Where I live they call it pop, but the term is dying and I’m already calling it soda so...
yall got the wrong boylands that is my favorite soda and is infinitly better then diet coke. but hey i live in massachusetes so mabey is different up here
I been trying to quit drinking that poison for years! I am addicted too!!
This new channel be looking like Good Mythical MatPat
Sodeepop
11:46 shaftza kekw
This is a true Nerd thing and I love it. 🤣🤣🤣
I grew up in Southern Illinois and everyone there says "soda" and now I live in Central Ohio, but everyone says "pop". I got made fun of by some coworkers in the past by saying "soda"
D: "other" we called em all "Soft Drinks" growing up in quebec
You gotta get that boylands root beer
rpMuhUDJQMM
In Denmark we would just call it cola
I’m ‘soda’ but I like ‘pop’
what happend to pepsi
Down in South Carolina its called a coke or coke product or soda
Coke for the wwiiiiiiiinnnnn
am i the only one that calls it fizzy? 😂
I'm a diet coke and I approve this message
Im a pop man
If you get the chance, I recommend RC cola. One of my favorites.
There’s also a food lion chain in Maryland
I work at a Food Lion, underrated quality there
Boylan is fucking amazing, I’m addicted to their root beer.  I haven’t tried their diet cola though
"Coca cola" as a french guy  !
15:35 I live in Pennsylvania, where everyone probably has the most neutral voice possible. We usually call it soda, which is probably similar with the rest of the northeast
Finnish coke is very metallic tasting since sinebrychoff makes they normally make alcohol and you can taste the fact that they should be touching soda im now forced to drink pepsi ;-;  and obviously max what kind of an animal drinks regular pepsi
why is bendy in the intro?
change this to coke vs pepsi
It’s soft drink in 🇦🇺
Harris Teeter: The Hero We All Needed.
Looks like im going to King Soopers to get some diet cola
So you're telling me.. your teeth are fake?
I like soda-pop myself
Aspartame is one of the most extensively studied sweeteners (if not The most studied). And so far it's been found safe for consumption. Obviously, as with anything, there's a limit to how much you should have. Everyone knows the rat cancer study; human studies found no link between aspartame and cancer.
Hotel coke is shitty
Only problem I've found with store brand diet soda is the extra citric acid actually burns a bit more and cause irritation both internally and in the mouth after enough consumption.
Eastern Canada and we use Soft Drinks I guess?  Mean, we usually ask for the exact thing we want and wait staff will ask "what drink do you want with that?".  So yeah, don't really have a strong regionalism.
Yeessssss i work at kroger and I hear that our soda is so good all the time
D: i am from Australia and call it softdrink
Definitely soda
In Canada we have an investigative journalism show called CBC Marketplace, this episode feels strongly just like that.
I feel like every company that sells sodas with stevia uses WAY too much stevia! I buy the pure stuff all the time, and it's really easy to add too much
the coke one
A better way for them to perform this experiment would have been if they covered the cup so it would be far more unbiased while you try to force your self to be impartial when you have a hard stance on something its next to impossible I would love to see this done again but where they can't see what the color is or a chance to smell it before they take a sip.
caffeinated beverage, thanks
Be careful diet cola can give cancer
What about izzy cans?
I’ve lived in the south my entire life and never had a waitress ask me what kind of coke you want
I like to drink either Vanilla Coke or Pepsi Cherry. But it has to be super cold af right before it freezes over.
I like to skip from Pepsi for one month to coke for the other than repeat it always gives that first coka cola felling an first Pepsi feeling every month
b
Dude, you forgot Tab! Tab is super good.
8:00 well that means it's time for me to invest in SodaStream over grandpa soda
Tonic up here in the northeast. Also I don't believe diet Pepsi lost. Sorry guys why else would you skip over it and cut the sound. Just saying. Love the video 🙌🏼
Whole Food's Bizarre Diet Soda
I used to drink a lot of Diet Pepsi during my last years in university, somehow now I can't drink it, make me headache so I switched to regular Pepsi. Apparently the lack of sugar on diet version is what make me the headache.
I kinda want a food theory on all the artificial sweeteners and if they're actually better than just using sugar
A all the way
It's pure bias and the fact you don't know what cola actually tastes like, and the fact your buds have pretty much been poisoned by the garbage Diet Coke pumps out and claims is soda..... Maybe pick a better non diet soda since NONE not one is good for your health.....
As I Midwesterner myself, I always have and always will call it pop.
Diet coke is so gross. What a ridiculous premise for an episode!
Dude just go to a lemon lime drink to replace Diet Coke
Where do you get "fountain" coke to drink at home?  That ruins the test for most of us,  you should have tested a store bought coke.
I want you to try Faygo so badly...
Idk about the diet version, but RC cola is possibly better than Coke 90% of the time
So let me get this straight, you really like Splenda, and that was your theory? I say that because its stronger in the fountain drink then in the can. Running low on Ideals? How about finding out what happened to the oddly shaped can called fire that was dragon fruit flavored or why the only dragon fruit flavored drink that's left is the water down vitamin water by coke.
3:46 o.o captions that matpat said something dirty
O.o
You learned nothing from the New Coke debacle, as a supposed Diet Coke fan.  Watch or read Malcolm Gladwell talk about the failure of the Coke vs Pepsi "sip" taste tests of decades ago that resulted in the massive New Coke failure.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruBAxKaWchY  Also, your taste senses do not "reset" immediately as some ingredients can bind and stay bound to your taste sensors for quite some time.  Ever brush your teeth and drink orange juice even 30 minutes later or vice versa?  I'd wager money that you end up not enjoying and switching away from the "winner" of your bracket before long.
I drink Diet Coke time to time......but like all other sodas, it never drinks me.
15:33 D: Sodie Pop
Bretish mate so I like me a bit o pop
did you put it in the soda stream
You did these matchups wrong. With a 16 seed bracket it should be:  1/16 and 8/9 4/13 and 5/12 3/14 and 6/11 2/15 and 7/10
as someone who lives in NC these grocery stores are ones I've hard of
It still blows my mind how much Mat and Steph look alike.  To be clear I'm not taking a jab at their looks.  They're both very nice looking.  It's just crazy how much they look alike. I also live in NC and shop at Food Lion.  A lot of the Food Lion brand stuff is better than the name brand equivalents.  We also call it coke here (with a small c).  If it's sweet and carbonated it's coke.
mate its called coke
2:16 We were so close to greatness, this close
I drink Kroger soda here in Michigan, it is better priced than name brands and I don't have problem with the flavor. B.T.W., diet and cola beverages aside, have you ever tried "Moxie"? Talk about medicinal.
I dunno if it's the same or even available in the US but man, River Cola Zero by Aldi has to take my top spot of all the Diet Coke's I have tasted so far. It's almost disgusting how good it is. I even got called insane for claiming that it probably tastes better than normal cola due to sugar lingering on your tongue long after the taste but our blind tests always had this result.
B... duh
im pop
I'm Canadian so we all say "pop". I can't stand the word 'soda' I can only think of baking soda LOL
We do not call all soda “coke” in the south..
I ADORE DIET COKE I HAVE FOUND A MATCH
Coke
When you said the Harris Teeter one was from the nearest grocery store and that you just stumbled upon it, man I started rooting for that underdog. When you were so enthousiastic about the fruity taste, I was hoping it was Teeter. When you crowned it the actual winner though.. man, what a wholesome journey that little neighbour of yours has gone through. Made my day
I'm actually shocked that MatPat is giving up Diet Coke lol. I remember back like 7 years ago when this show would make the Diet Coke jokes and now it feels like we're growing up lol.
We call it soda here lol.
It's soda.
It's soda, nothing else. Coke is a specific "brand" of soda. I can't order a Pepsi by asking for a Coke. Pop is what you do to a balloon, or the pimples on your face.
WAIT?!? FOOD LION STILL EXISTS?!? THERE USED TO BE ONE WHERE I LIVE IN OKLAHOMA!
When you know your partner so well you tie rock, paper, scissors
Diet coke at this point gets free advertising from all 3 channels 😂
This hurt as much as pat and jen breaking up
I never thought that this day would come 😂😂😂😂😂
You know diet is worse for you than normal pop? All the chemicals they add to make it seem better. Also they taste bad
Soft drink
16 minutes in I can really tell Matpat is feeling that caffeine
"and florida" flordia is it's own region confirmed
Soft Drink  Is what we call it
Im in uk so fizzy
let the pouring of the sugar bereft beverages begin!
Matpat: what are you? Pop, soda, coke, or other?  Me: Down here in Ireland we just call it a fuckin fizzy drink I'm not even jokin  Here's an example for you "Hey ma' can ye get me a fizzy drink from the fridge please?" "Alright hunny ya want a coke?" "Ye please tysm"  Welcome to dublin
15:28 fizzy drink
That title sounds like less of a theory, and more of a statement. But congrats!
Man, I just got real big into Pepsi zero. None of the stores listed are in my area.  Might have to try Diet Right, although I'm not great with sucralose, it is better than aspartame.
Matpat your real name is Nephew
Do you know I am drinking coke while watching this video
I’m d for Dutch we call it’s by the name or frisdrank which means the same as a-b and c lol
i water down all my sodas about 30-50% because of the strong acid. Perhaps it makes me a loony but at least ill have my teeth in 20 years.
I have to do this same thing cause I'm way to addicted to cherry Pepsi
Oddly enough, I have heard of Food Lion. I'm from Florida, so Publix is my grocery store, but I go to school in Virginia. Plenty of food lion here.
when you wanna try harris teeter soda but tou live in asia 😞👎👎
im addicted to seven up
ik, ik i’m a month late but the rock paper scissors is so cute.
Shasta makes a good sprite, that's about it
I don't know if the diet European sodas taste different just like the regular sodas do. If so, they should have a rematch for the sake of diet coke next time they are in Europe
21:46 «as shocked as you are» I wasnt shocked
People in the phillipines: Hi, I would like to buy a coke pepsi  'We also have Coke Diet Pepsi  I'll take the coke diet pepsi   only applies to millenials and boomers
Am I the only person that realized the sound is only in the right ear?
I don't do diet and I haven't been near a Harris Teeter or Kroger's for a couple decades, but I do remember Big K being a favorite back when it was readily available to me.  Currently, my favorite sodas, in order, goes about like this:  1.  Pepsi 2.  RC 3.  Aldi's Generic Soda 4.  Bubba Cola (Sav-A-Lot) 5.  [ Pretty Much Any Other Generic Cola ] 6.  [ Flavored Colas, Excluding Coke ] 7.  [ Counting Root Beer As A Cola Flavor ] 8.  Stabbing Myself In The Mouth 9.  Coka-Cola  It's not that I dislike Coke.  Really, I actually do like it.  But it has a very complex flavor that is not what I'm looking for in a daily drink.  When it comes time to make mixed drinks, I don't want anything else, but keep that crap out of my cup on a work day.
(...did anyone else notice he intro'd 9th place as 7th and there were two 7th's...)
Coke zero is still my favorite. And since I live in the NY metropolitan area that has not a single one of those Kroger stores, I'll stick with it.
Dr thunder! yo the kick on that is amazing dawg.
I cant believe the owners of coke didn't respond
Ugh. Don't get diet coke. At all. It's gross. Doesn't taste like real Coke (like, at all)...and I don't even like real Coke THAT much...I mean, I'll drink it...maybe 12 cans' worth in a year.  No, my soda tastes run more...Dr. Pepper-y. Although I do love me some Cherry Coke...we (inexplicably*) don't get Cherry Coke in Canada...and the border's been closed for, like, a year. I have one can left from 24 that were purchased during a trip across the border in September 2019. And I'm saving it until I know that it's not going to be the very last can of Cherry Coke I will ever drink (i.e. when the border DOES open and the 'rona is naught but a terrible nightmare from which we have since woken up).  *Ask the question "why is there no Cherry Coke in Canada" and go down a bottomless internet rabbit hole. Nobody seems to know the REAL reason...and the only "official" answer there is, is the unsatisfying "we tried it in Canada in the '80s, and it didn't sell"...which, I mean...C'MON! AFTER 30+ YEARS you don't think you should try again? Like...peoples' tastes haven't changed? I am sure with the right marketing campaign, Cherry Coke could grab some decent market share. Sure, part of that would come out of existing Coca Cola market share...but I think MORE would come from Dr. Pepper and other smaller brands that sell cherry-flavoured beverages. And it's not like the fact that it takes away some Coca Cola sales has prevented them from selling it in any other country...brand diversity is a GOOD THING. Stupid corporate execs thinking that Canadians won't like it enough to justify selling it here....dumb dumb dumb.
Mfs really spent a whole video to tell me kroger brand diet soda is good
I use to call Diet Coke the "nectar of the gods". Drinking about a litre a day. Then I gave it up for a year and now it just tastes terrible. The experience of drinking is painful, the burning and carbon gas is a horrid. Still I never drank it with a straw, yuck.
you should try Vita Cola, a German brand that goes all the way in Citrusy-ness.
What about Sodapop?
In Alabama we call it a soft drink
I love that Food Lion made it onto the bracket Spent my whole life getting groceries at Food Lion
i wish my mom did that with smoking
Good for you👍😊
I've done a few coke-offs in my day
I'm just like you Mat, from Ohio so I call it pop!
Literally none of those shops selling the cola are available in my country 😭
Food Lion's Diet Dr Pepper is my secret. So underrated. I always for the store brands. Even Walmart's can be better then name brand.
All about Malt drinks! (Non alcoholic).  Great video.
real talk Coke Zero Sugar slaps harder than my dad
Boylan's cream soda is much better
Store Brand sodas are cheaper but better
This is the best YouTube Channel there is thanks for fun
Get the aspartame out of US
Now, I wouldn't encourage ever repeating this excursion due to the intake and experience, however I object to the execution. When going through, while handling them in pairs was perfectly fine, I don't believe you should've known what those pairs were. Being aware of what was what could bias both the active experiment (Such as recognizing that although the clear drink was one soda, thus deducing immediately what the other one was.) and the other results, such as when two sodas are too extremely similar, the decision may be based on the brand rather than the drink itself. Perhaps a bias for or against.  THAT being said, I realize this is all in good fun and the tasting is purely for Mats personal drink-of-choice, so this is more of a footnote than anything, and hardly matters. I'm enjoying the video, and find this whole channel rather pleasant and relaxed.
B: Soda
There is a really really good german coke version its called "mezo mix"
You can always just snort regular coke
if you arent sodapop you aint right
you sai dyou were shocked diet pepsi lost but you didnt' show the reaction as it played out....
You drink Pop, Bake with Soda
This should have been a purely blind taste test....taste #1, taste #2, which is better?
“You’ve probably never heard of food lion” *laughs in south carolina*
love jeg coca cola
Impossible
Well isn’t citric acid super important for krebs cycle?
bruh food lion is north and south carolina
Pop
17:08 is it jusst me or does that huh sound like ross from friends
I TRULY HAD NO IDEA PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF NORTH CAROLINA DIDINT KNOW WHAT FOOD LION WAS 😭
Midwest (St. Louis, MO) Soda
I'm pretty pissed that Coke Stevia was discontinued. It makes NO sense. I will not switch to another Coke product.
soda person
"I wish I could send both of these through"  That's why you need a loser's bracket Matt ;)
I said "Coke" when I was little living in the south. I started calling it "Pop" when I lived in the Pacific Northwest. Now I live on the east coast and call it "Soda."
So what ya saying is the world is better when it's fruity... 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈  Yay
In Australia it's called fizzy drink
March Matness is actually another name for the NCAA wrestling tournament lmao
Nooo!
Consider: taking the top 4 and just rotating them every week
Mtn Dew Game Fuel Zero
What kind of subhuman drinks diet soda as their main soda?
I really love the boylan cane cola.
I actually really like Stevia cola, it's zero calorie and I have no guilt drinking it
My dad worked for pepsi and coke. He tells everyone. How terrible it is for you. Between the artificial sweeteners. And the corn syrup.  I would never touch it.  I would say. Switch to tea. man.
the root beer soda stream is better
im canadian wtf is soda
I say carbonated drink
“Hey look it’s the Diet Coke guy!” -no one ever
You forgot glass bottle diet coke
in the UK, pepsi zero is called Pepsi Max
Halfway through the video you just knew that they were gonna go for the underdog
R.I.P. meijer brand
so cola zero is the best cola flavored thing in my area I can get because I live in sweden, got it
Food Lion was actually the grocery store of choice before I moved out of Georgia.
Dang it. Send me some HT to the ph. :(
#question_food_theory_idea Is an *ice cream sandwich* a *_sandwich?_*
here in my neighborhood called the philippines. We refer to them as softdrinks.
MatPat and Stephanie are so cute!!
He was addicted to one drug  He now found a new drug Matpat is addicted once more
0:38 I feel bad for you. Please make an EarthBound video.
Never heard of coke life
Oh my god: The 3 way tie because they couldn't decide! ITS FOOD WARS!
I'm southern but I call it cola.
As a Norwegian I am offended Pepsi Max didn`t make it through to like the end
My housemate at uni just used to call it 'nice drink'. So if we were hung over he'd pop to the shop to get some 'nice drink'
Fountain is never consistent though. How can you choose fountain as a replacement when the ratio between CO2 to syrup is never the same?
Wait...when did Matpat move to North Carolina? I thought he was in California!
TAB!!! What a missed opportunity !
The Food Theorists If you want to consume stevia you have to be used to the taste for like a year or more, to me a stevia user for more than 2 years it's more like sugar sirup than a plant ewww thing now. So I think you should have invited someone else too for that taste test who uses stevia regularly.
D: my parents and lots of other Indian parents just say “drinks” and everyone knows it means coke, sprite and ect
I'm a girl but Steph is sooo pretty in this, can't stop looking away.  The simple but flattering shirt? The natural make up? Wow
Best possible cola  Diet cola   Seems Mat was the coala All along
drink diet water then
As someone else who's heavily addicted to diet coke, I guessed them almost immediately. Can has no carbonation because it's surrounded in metal and tastes awful anyway. 2 liter was middle due to the visible carbonation from being recently poured. Fountain was far right (I assume poured out of a to-go cup from a Mcdonalds fast food) and the hue was slightly different.
your Pepsi zero sugar is called Pepsi Max in Australia & it's  the best soft drink ever  Hands down no contest
we call it газировка
LoL we dont even have diet coke in my country
A bit much to say it is the best diet cola the world has ever known, while only testing American diet colas.
I say pop, it's common in Canada from what I can tell.
i love cough syrup...
I honestly call carbonated drinks soft drinks. Not soda. Not pop. They are soft beverages compared to the hard that is alcoholic drinks.
Pepsi low key tasting like windex      Don’t ask me how I know what windex tastes like
Speaking as someone who is allergic to citrus I have an insight citric acid runs the world as a preservative and a common ingredient in soaps and foods.
Why Diet? Why not just drink the real thing dude!
minute maid sparkling grape 5 calories a can...
Boylan’s root beer is amazing, so I can forgive them for their diet cola misdeeds.
C i live in florida
the southern stores are able to cater to regional tastes.
Diet shasta sodas don't have aspertame. If you're sensitive to it, shasta is an awesome substitute. The diet cream soda tastes like it has sugar in it. And the rootbeer is very good too.
Love it! No ice.
15:29  D:Other. In Philippines, we call it soft drinks.
For the question I'm other cause down here in Australia we call em soft drinks
Diet sodas are not good for you Of the fake sugar they add it causes diabetes and obesity
Ya know, it MatPat transitioned, she’d look just like her wife. 💅
Here are my favorites: Real sugar Pepsi, Doctor pepper/Cherry coke, Mountain dew.
The fact that they have to rock paper scissors six times just to figure out what soda is best shows these are great people
I love Zevia, I have been drinking it for years and for a while they did have colored soda but they got rid of it a couple years ago when the caramel coloring came out as being a lot worse them many thought and so Zevia went all in on being healthier and are all their soda clear
18:19 I mean, is anybody going to talk about this?  *Hilarious.*
pop, diet coke, coke zero and diet pepsi all delish
Jaritos, Mexican coke. My favourite trust me it’s amazing.
0:45
HEY there is still diet coke in there
That whole rock papaer scissors thing really showed how perferct they are for each other, honestly.
Do ur self a favor and stay away from all soda
Coke/soda/drink
B
I wonder, could you add citric acid to any food and make it better?
Hi, my names Jason and im an addict, iv been drinking coke zero for 10 years....
They left out Pepsi max
the thing is, whatever you like now, you will probably get bored about it and change for another thing, then come back or not and so on...
As a southerner, I stand with Harris Teeter Diet cola, drink about 5 cans per day. (Also drink 1.5gallons of water per day. )
I say sodie-pop as I grew up traveling a lot
All my homies shop and or work for the Kroger family of companies
We call them fizzys, don’t know if it’s a country thing or just my family tho
As someone from NC, I did not know Food Lion and Harris Teeter were such local grocery stores!  This is so cool; learn something new everyday.  Thanks for being awesome as always, MatPat!
Lucky for me my body doesnt like fake sugars (that I've had)
Wait hol up, i didnt know matt lived in my state, das cool!
thank you very much mat pat  north Carolina is very nice
D! When I ask my waiter, I say "may I get a carbonated sugar water but without the sugar"
#dietcokesuks
The aspartame has rotted his brain, I had wondered why he called KFC original recipe "extra crispy"
I moved from NC to Texas, I miss all these old brands
Dr pepper is the best soda
For some reason we’re I live people use all of those lol they use pop coke soda
I used to never drink diet colas, and to be frank it was that taste. Then I tried diet dr.pepper for the first time and I was hooked. Less flavor and more carbonation, its amazing.
"its cough syrup!" well, if boylan has kept their recipe the same for 100+ years... yeah. it would be. soda pop started as a medicinal product. a recipe from the 19th - 20th century likely wouldn't have strayed too far from the very og soda recipes.
Pog
pop
Soda gang
In Egypt we call it : "حاجة ساقعة"  Which literally means "something cold" !
Coke is fanta. Coke is coke. Coke is Pepsi. Coke is Sprite. And so on.
soda pop unless its a coke product then its coke
Diet Coke tastes like nothing
But where in NC? That's my home state! I'd be happy to invite you over for a party! Fayetteville, LET'S GO!!!
I moved from Charlotte, NC to RIchmond, VA...and my local store went from Harris Teeter to Kroger! I don't drink diet cola though, so I can't taste it to tell you, but if you want some Kroger diet cola mailed to you, lmk :D
I'm a C:Coke for everything
Soft drinks are trash, water for life
Wait when did Matt move to North Carolina??
you should have randomized the match ups and not known what two was in each round, but interesting none the less
I’m rooting for root beer this time 🍻  Noooooooooooooooo
Only down in New Zealand you will call it "Fizzy"
In Australia it’s “soft drink”
I personally call it “fizzy sweet drink occasionally containing caffeine”.
cool drink
Might just be a Northern Irish thing, but we call them “Fizzy Drinks”
In Australia it’s soft drink
Here in Australia we call it cool drink, or fizzy drink.
Bundaberg diet cola
IN my personal opinion the real cough syrup is dr pepper from taco bell at least my local taco bell i dont know if its the same with the entire chain or just my local restaurant  i would like to know
After living in NC for 22 years I gotta say that Foodlion is where it’s at. You can’t beat it.
you know the surge in diet coke is bad
We would go to a resteraunt and the waiter would say what drink do you want
Pepsi
Steph looks like she is held at gun point
Cold drink
Your sister is cute
Diet soda contains aspartame, which causes memory degradation. Every person I've met that drink excessive diet sodas/drinks have had terribly worsened short-term and long-term memory loss. Just drink regular soda.
Pop ftw im from canada
Soda
Soda
Is it odd that the married couple look and act like siblings?
SODA
I never started diet soda. Hated from the start.
I have been saying for years that kroger soda is the best. they even use real sugar if you don't go for the diet
Can confirm mattpat, I used to work at a fredmyer, they do indeed have a similar taste to what you described for the Diet Coke, they sell for 99 cents in most freddys.
D: Soft Drink (Y)
“The North Carolina-based supermarket food lion which you’ve probably never heard of” I live in NC too Mat, your not all that.
Soft drink gang
i would like to say THANK YOU MatPat i went to my local ralphs and bought there store brand which is big k and from what  you described  it tasts THE SAME THANNNNNNNNKKKK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU👏
Ice cold can cola onc an month. Is the best thing in the world
Wait they say pop in the Midwest? I live in the Midwest and most people I know say soda. Maybe more people are moving here who say soda.
North Carolina might actually be the soda capital of the world. Screw GA. We have Pepsi, Cheerwine, and Harris Teeter BOIS!!!
Boylans other sodas are actually pretty good, especially the Birch Beer.
GLASS BOTTLE DIET COKE
Borderlands fans be like: ...!
I'd like to see you do this tournament again a year later.  Harris Teeter is probably tasty, and I'm sure it is, but there should also be something to be said for new positive taste bias.  I'd like to see if Harris Teeter will stick around for the long haul or if rode high on new hotness flavor buzz.
im not a diet nor a coke fan. Dr. Pepper is where its at
WHERE IS MY INKA COLA !? :(
I say soda
I was shouting my support for the Teeter brand. North Carolina born and raised.
I’m B/soda type of guy
No glass bottle Diet coke in the run off?
up north here its pop, hundred percent. i said soda in a group chat and everyone was jsut like "why are you saying it weird?"
i go to food lion for all my groceries, seeing it in a video is so shocking
1:30 are you kidding? that's insultingly low also at the beginning my inner bias was screaming that classic is the superior coca-cola product, heck even soft drink, but then i remembered how muc i don't like arguments and decided it was best to just say this instead of what i was originally going to. got all that? me neither.
Matpat reviewing diet soda sounds like Fantano reviewing albums
I'm from Quebec in Canada and we usually "a coke" or "a pepsi". I have never heard anyone call it a pop so I was surprised 🤣 (my cousin calls it a cola but he's the only one I have seen call it or cola)
i am disgusted and youre wrong
Should have also tested the UK's "Coke Lite."
The only correct one. Pop.
AUSTRALIA = softdrink
YES someone agrees store brand soda is awesome i love offbrand mtn dew and dr peppers
don't know if anyone pointed this out but zero calories doesn't exist anything below like 50 calories can be labeled as zero.  in the USA at least.
Seriously though... what psychopaths actually enjoy the taste of Diet Coke?
Boylan cream soda is the best
coke0 >diet coke
Soda
we used to call our sodas suds, yes suds
14:33 food lion is actually named ‘Delhaize’ [Duhlheyza] and it comes from Belgium. You can also find it in other countries like Romania etc, but the country of origine is Belgium. I actually didn’t know there were ‘food lions’ in America.😃 Greetings from Belgium! Love your content from all of your channels (filmtheory is still my favorite though😋)
i am not an expert but i'm sure carbonated water (diet coke) isn't that bad, right? From my research Carbonated Water is apparently is bad,, not but not bad as you think. And I mean like, if I had to say,  I think carbonated water would only be like 0.9% bad for you.
Coca Cola Zero is 10 times better in flavor than Coca Cola light (Diet Coke in the USA)... I work at McDonald’s and the ‘fountain’ drinks have a totally different taste to them than the bottled or canned drinks. Coca Cola light from the fountain is my LEAST favorite drink and is our LEAST sold drink. Coca Cola Zero is one of our most sold drinks and also my preferred drink. The ‘normal’ cola is our most popular drink but honestly from the fountain I don’t like the normal cola, from a can or bottle sure no problem but there’s just something about the fountain that alters the taste and for normal cola it alters it not in a good way. Just my opinion.
I think I'm the only one but I call it fizzle
B: soda
#teampop
All of them.
arkansas=soda
You must go Pepsi.
Question does piggly wiggly have diet soda
cherry pepsi max all the way
Coca Cola has brought back their Glas bottles in Germany... And nothing is better than getting this bad boy out of the fridge on hot days, trust me
I call it D. Fizzy drink.
Omg try olipop cola flavor!! It's a probiotic cola. It tastes more like a traditional egg cream kinda cola. It's so creamy.
Food Lion also has an Orange Pineapple soda that reminds me of Cactus Cooler. (A drink that is not sold in GA and May only exist in Southern California where I grew up.)  I've never tried them back-to-back, seeing as I've never found them in the same state, but it's noteable that Food Lion has better than average soda. Also I love some Big K Diet Cola.
Yo guys! Its mathew pathew!!!
2 coke vs heris who will win spoiler alert heris
Shasta was shitsta back in the early 70's
Did you mean to put this out on April 1st?
Hey, cool seeing Matt likes fruity stuff
I tried Diet Coke for the first time today. It is disgusting
Any chance I could convince you to look into why the fountain sodas are better and so distinctive? I am an avid diet coke drinker too and I knew (before yall said it) that the left was can, middle was bottle, and the right was fountain and I knew fountain would win
I don't even want to know how many calories this would be if it wasn't diet soda.
Just saying, I actually go to food lion in Virginia
it's kinda weird that I think I can taste the cokes' flavor just by their description in this video.
I’m sodies all the way 😂
Mhmmmmmm mhmmmmmm (cough) (cough) dr.pepper (cough) (cough)
OMG, Food Lion is Delhaize in Belgium. It is founded in Belgium. I had no idea they have a branch in the US!
The intro is honestly the best part of this channel
Kroger's Stock has just SKY-ROCKETED!
Lacroix is a good substitute for soda
This makes me happy to live down the street from a Harris Teeter
MatPat: You probably never heard of Harris Teeter and Food Lion  Me who grew up on Harris tester and food lion 🤔
15:14 can agree. Steph is telling the truth. "What kinda coke you want?" "Oh, I'll take a Sprite, please, thank you"
We call our “Sodas” here: Fizzy drinks... I know wacky concept right?
I thought he was gonna quit coke for coke
The universe really wanted that Harris Teeter one to come through 😂   Also, we tend to call it fizzy or soft drink in Aus ☺
ici c'est Pepsi
So, when I first saw the list, I was a bit miffed to not see my drink of choice, Diet Big K Cola, on the list. Kroger is HUGE, after all, so *surely* there had to be one near there. Finding the Harold Teeter fill-in near the end? Lovely.  If you want to test it out, let me know, and I'll happily send you a 2-liter and/or a 12 pack in cans so that you can test 'em out. (The cans are the better option, IMHO.)
It's soft drink you animals!
D. In Ireland we call them minerals, supposedly because the original carbonated drinks were made from mineral water for medicinal purposes.
Is anyone else a "soft drink" person?
His name is Matthew ????????
In Australia they're all Colas
15:29 In my country, we call them soft drinks for some reason 🤷‍♀️
I'm from MO and i love Harris teeter and... food lion is okay... my cuz lives in north carolina and i lived with her while my mom was training for illinois doc
ok so near where I live there is a fred meyer and than one town over there is a city market. I drove to both and got their diet cola's. I had my brother come taste them with me and had my sister put them in unlabeled glasses and neither of us could tell a difference. They tasted exactly the same.
Town Club is really good.
Can u do a borderlands video on game theory
4:36 Someone edit this down to "Let the Coke-off begin!" with the straw in his hand.
I used to be a total Pepsi head but after a couple of years of Lidl's brand zero or xx as I think its called now I have gone off the taste of Pepsi.  I guess tastebuds can be changed or rather trained.
Pepsi max?

You quitting Diet Coke is like quitting cocaine. Congrats, dude!

Food lion is in other places also
00:37 holy crap they amassed a whole tableful of toxins.
Matt Patt has learned what Rhett and Link have known for years, Kroger always brings it's A game.
Diet Coke is going to watch this video and immediately change their recipe. They’re not about to lose their best customer.  [Edit]: and yes i mean *Diet Coke* as an *entity.*
15:30any body say soda instead of pop or cola
Soda
In the Philippines we usually call it soft drinks
I knew in my mind that boyland was gonna lose but I didn't want to accept it
I've lived in the south my entire life, I have never heard anyone call soda coke. Everyone here at least calls it soda (Could be because we're a military town, we also don't have the traditional southern accent and mostly just have a generic American accent)
POV: your at a restaurant  Waiter: we offer coke products  You: Diet Coke  Me: orange crush
So my brother ran a soda experiment once to see if people can  tell what sodas they're tasting, it was mostly focused on orange sodas, he got Fanta, Crush, and Sunkist and had 7 people taste test them and try to determine which was which, and out of the 7 people I was the only person to tell them apart accurately, and I did so without much deliberation, I knew right away which one I was tasting, he also tested Dr. Pepper (my favorite soda) vs Mr Pibb, and the generic Dr Thunder, that one more people were able to tell some difference but again I was able to do so with ease. If you guys wanna do another episode like this but with Dr Pepper and clones or orange soda feel free to reach our
I'm a soda
Team coke, but I agree with Steph. Dr Pepper is the best
No it’s not called Pepsi it’s called Beapis
a b c d
Hmm not sure I liked that graphic of matpat's saliva covered tongue wiggling around
Shasta was the cola of choice at my local hospital when my kid was born, and when I had a 3 day EEG to see about my seizures  Soda!
What’s funny about Harris Teeter winning and your theory on Kroger subsidiary stores having good cola is that I really like Kroger’s Big K colas
i like dr pepper
Big red
Being a large soda drinker myself it is obvious that you don't like the taste of natural sweeteners.  Nothing wrong with that.  Taste is a personal preference, just something interesting I noticed. I don't drink diet, for many reasons, but I wonder how the diet vs regular stack up with artificial and natural sweeteners.  It would be cool to see a deeper dive into this.
Fountain as the coke brand ? You monster! It’s going to be different everywhere you get it ! Hardly scientific
Food lion is in Virginia also and is the Closest grocery store to my house.
Here in South Carolina is coke
this better be a joke
real cola or nothing. all the fake sugar makes me sick asf. if you are going to be unhealthy you may as well drink something that tastes nice and does not make you sick
Its soda pop you losers
German Afri Cola
I find Zevia to be absolutely aweful.  I taste no sweetness at all, just bitterness.  In fact, I find anything with stevia to be bitter and terrible tasting.
Me drinking Diet Coke while watching this
At the end of the video when Stephanie heard him say that his favourite is the store brand one she gave him the look of death
Lacroix. I know it tastes terrible but when you are dieting, it's as CLOSE to soda as you can get.
i call it soda
Soda
Harris Teeth is LOW now
I used both soda and pop back and forth. I'm also from the midwest
Up here in Canada, it's pop
What a Cinderella story.
"Here in the Midwest we say pop" Me a Midwesterner: ew
two words... Cuba Cola
Rc cola
WE BE SUCKIN DOWN HEB DIET COLA DOWN HERE IN TEXAS BOAHH!!!
Regular...
Pop
Coke
13:54 haaa m haaa
In the script and on everything but the actual bracket, there were 3 sodas that were called the 7th seed
Kroger low-key has the best salt and vinegar chips too!
As a superfan, I'm surprised you don't have a favorite soda fountain. "The Wendy's down the street has a better mix than the McDonalds next door, but the McDonads by my office is better than both."  "Quick Trip has better Diet Dr. Pepper, but worse Diet Mtn Dew than 7-11".  These are the numbers I need to see.
You can order stuff online just saying.
O7O7O7O7O7O7.   DIET COKE  I LOVE DC
Food lion is the only store near me I’ve never heard of any other store
No Name is what we used to call store brands here in Atlantic Canada. Now we have presidents choice by Superstore and compliments by Sobeys.
Well... Hes got something... Not a rum and coke but instead a coke on the rocks
Soda person
12:20 "It is so bizarre, It's wacky" Me: *JoJo fan noices*
I call it soda, but I've had family who've called it tonic.
In South Africa, I grew up saying ‘soft drink’ instead of soda. I think it was lost with Gen Z, and nowadays people say drink, that’s it 🤷🏻
15:28 i am 汽水 and soda
Next video: drinks diet coke
how many layers of doritos dose it take to reach the moon
Personally, I can't stand any other diet-sodas besides Coke Zero. CZ is the only one where I don't taste the aspartame aftertaste, which I find horrifying, don't know why it's so hard for the soda industry to hide that taste :/.
Time for Harris teeter to start shipping international. 🤌
I personally always thought Diet Coke tasted like liquid chalk with a squeeze of lemon, but that's just me
You should have done each different match up on different days. Would have taken longer to film, but would have given a better 'feel' for the taste of everything
why is this like a science class this it is just a dude drinking diet coke
Pepsi max is the best 0 calorie drink, but if you are thirsty you could drink 2 pints of it and it will never quench your thirst
i just say soft drink
As a PA native, I love seeing Boylan
its called soft drink
First off love your YouTube channel. However it was not fair to enter diet Coke fountain against all the other sodas that came bottles and cans. It should have been diet Coke in a bottle or a can versus the rest of the field.
Raised in Alabama it’s Coke no matter what , living in Arizona now for 22 years and it’s now a Soda but sometimes I slip and say Coke still
Californian- we say soda   I can discern canned Diet Coke from plastic bottle, and fountain as well.   Have you noticed a difference between domestic and oversees DC?  It seems to me that oversees Diet Coke, Europe, MX, and the Philippines had a better taste.
I say pop or soda. Mostly pop
Please do a private label video!
Diet coke is basically alcohol to mat
Try monk fruit it tastes almost exactly like sugar
why does mat seem low key sus in this video? is he bi or sum
It’s a little unhealthy?
Where I live we got a store called sam’s club
Diet Dr pepper is the only thing that taste halfway decent out of all the diet sodas as long as it's cold enough
Bottle pop best flavor of Diet Coke
B
I grew up in Dallas Texas and I've always called it soda.
Soda
"don't judge a bottle of soda by its label" -Me
About the citric acid: it's a common ingredient that many people underutilize in their kitchens too. Wonder why your soup or sauces taste so dull, probably just need some lemon juice. I often find food that might need more salt likely needs a splash of acid instead.
Diet Coke from Piggly Wiggly is better than any other diet coke
Dude me and Matpat are the me person I'm addicted to diet coke bro
When you realized that you live in the same earth as Matpat 0_O
I'd bet you that both of these sodas from north Carolina come from the same factory and just got relabeled.
stevia my beloved has been knocked down, and I will now cry.
Food lion is the american name of a belgium supermarket chain called the delhaize because I can recognize that signature lion anywhere
Bro, I live in NC, Food Lion is EVERYWHERE. If you live in NC, Food Lion is unescapable
Coke is my favorite kinda _pop_
BIG 8 SODA
Hey, my FAVORITE soda of all time, that's Boylan Bottling root beer. I'm not here for a fight, different people like different things, that said, what's everyone's favorite?
Hm now I'm definitely tempted to head to QFC and grab their generic soda...
Next food theory Citris is the krabby patty secret ingredient!!!
Diet Rite was underseeded, as it's the Diet Cola for the #3 soda manufacturer,  Dr. Pepper/7 Up, it should have been a 6-8 seed with the rest of the major brands  Pepsi sent a third product to the Second Round(Zero/Diet Caf Free/Sodastream)  Pepsi has a non-diet Caffeine-Free that's in a all gold can, so that's why it needs the "Diet" modifier
Back when I drank soda, the Diet Mountain Lion was better than the Diet Dew.
we have a harris teeter
Kind of unfair to pit fountain Diet Coke against grocery store pop. Fountain pop is almost universally better than store pop but that's just a food theory.
It's popular to believe that a chemical is going to do all sorts of bad things to you while something natural is going to be more healthy. Unfortunately, this is a load of bollocks. Many natural things are harmful and everything is chemicals.  Some of this stems from people's belief that there's no "free lunch." It seems hard for people to accept that they can cut the calories of sugar and still get the sweet taste. It's humans playing God with nature, so something has to be bad about it, right?  Well, no. Aspartame is incredibly well researched and there's no danger to the average person eating it. Even in doses so large that they're just silly there's no danger. However, there are some people who cannot process it (phenylketonurics; people who cannot process phenylalanine, one of the parts of the Aspartame molecule). This chemical can build up over their life and cause serious health risks. But that's a specific disorder and condemning aspartame because of that group would be like claiming that peanuts give you cancer because some people are allergic.  The other big point that anti-aspartame individuals tend to push is the fact that aspartame breaks down into methanol (i.e. wood alcohol, the stuff that causes you to go blind and die if you drink it), then formaldehyde (used for embalming) and finally formic acid (also known as ant venom). This sounds absolutely terrifying! Surely science has gone too far!!!! ... except it hasn't. The amount of methanol you get from even an excessive amount of aspartame is less than the trace amounts you get from drinking fruit juice.  Other claims that anti-aspartame individuals like to push don't find the need to be grounded in actual scientific fact. For example, there was a study that suggested a link between aspartame and brain cancer... except that the study was flawed and has subsequently been disproven. Conspiracy theorists never let the truth get in the way, though. One incorrectly carried out study is all it takes to prove once and for all that something is true, and any later evidence is just a cover up to keep us from seeing the truth.  In the end people push this claim because it speaks to their fears of science and the unknown. It feels like big business trying to pump us full of who-knows-what (the FDA knows, that's who!) to reap profit from our cold, dead, cancer-ridden corpses. I'm sure some of this fear is helped along by the producers of sugar who can feel the sting in their pocketbooks as people switch to a zero calorie sweetener. Ultimately, though, aspartame is one of the most studied things you will eat all day, and there's been no conclusive evidence that suggests any health disadvantage (except for phenylketonurics) from eating it, even in stupidly large quantities. - u/Koooooj
Food lion is in northeastern states to matt 14:39
Its crazy to hear them talk about "small local stores" like Harris Teeter and Food Lion as a Virginian with family in North Carolina. I thought those stores were way bigger than they apparently are.
I call it soft drink
So do we all make a pilgrimage to NC now?
In Mexico we call this kind of beverage "refresco"...I guess literally translated would be "fresh"
Lived in NC all my life, can confirm that Food Lion’s Diet Cola is god tier
I work at Food Lion in NC, seeing that beat Pepsi was crazy. I’m so curious where you are in NC. Seeing you come into my location would be crazy!
B: Soda
I live in the south so I say: “do you have Coke?” When I’m at a restaurant but I normally say soda
Boyalnds cream soda will always be one of my favorites
B
Diorite like the rock? 10:35
Another thing mat is known for is the guy that simultaneously whipped and nea neaed.
The second he quits Diet Coke, coke create zero sugar coke.
As someone who is not a Kroger shopper, I recently found myself there. Remembering this video, I picked up a two liter of Big K Cola Oh! (which is presumably similar to the winner from Harris Teeter). And I have to say, it is a spot-on recreation of the original Coke Zero, before it was reformulated to Coke Zero Sugar. The original Coke Zero had a far more complex flavor than Diet Coke, so it's no surprise that a knock-off version of it would beat the OG Diet Coke.
As a South Carolina native I have said Coke for every soda my whole life
How bout inca cola
Ginger ale is the best if you still want soda but want the healthiest option.
Reminds me, RIP Fry's electronics 🙏
Pop
Bro you did not try glass coke it’s made in Mexico most of the time and use cane sugar so that taste better then can plastic and not sheer about the other one
I love regular coke but I'm always burning the calories and I know what I ment when can bottle and  fountain taste different but mexican coke is the best
I like coke zero. Hope that's what he switches to!
I'll forever remember Shasta as the company that made Mario Soda. Man. I have some fond memories of kickin' back on the beach with a squat can of Yoshi Apple Soda...
Me watching this is Finland whit a glass of basic "orginal" cola
Can diet coke!!! - because we don't get fountain diet cokes around here...
How those all diet pepsis are even different
Did you test FreeStyle poison?
god im so tired of morons..
Harris Teeter gonna be loving the free marketing.
Matpat and his wife are so wholesome
im a pop person
In ireland we just say what drink do you want, sometimes what fizzy drink but usually just drink
Any soda drink diet or not is not just a little unhealthy... It cuts 1/5th of your total lifespan... Even if you drink it 2 times a week.  It shorten your life by 20 years or more.
Pepsi zero!!!!
Just use regular coke
i say soda lol
Drinking these without ice probably changes the flavor/feel of the sodas. Might change the rankings. Isnt there a thing about coke originally being drunk unrefrigerated and Pepsi being designed after refrigeration, so it tastes like a unrefrigerated coke?
Who would willingly drink diet soda?
You ain't ever had cough syrup until you've had Creomulsion cough syrup. We drank that $h!t back in the day. It had cherry bark, tar and some other God-awful ingredients. This was in the 60's.
I agree 100%, Kroger brand Cola is the best.
matpatTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Funny thing is the 7th seed does taste medicinal. But coke started out as a medicine
They should have sponsored him. Now they will be losing their highest paying customer.
I call em all coke lol
Food theory idea: how long could you survive in the woods alone
Its saturday night. I have no date. 5L bottle of Shasta. And my all-rush mixtape. Lets rock!
This Video Made Me Hungry...!
Why was i actually on the edge of my seat for this episode
im pop
Here in Croatia We call it cola
Other in Trinidad where I live ppl call it cokes or sweetdrink
In south Africa we call it cooldrink
I say soda. Also I hate diet soda but I'm curious about Harris's brand now.
mat pat expert coke connaiseur
In Florida everyone I know calls it soda I don't know what it is about this thing you are saying that in the South they call it Coke??? I mean Florida is pretty south and like no one here just calls it Coke they call it soda and on menus at restaurants you see it called soft drink so like I don't know where you get this notion that in the south they call it Coke????
Hey Mattpat where are the glass bottles because I know cans, plastic, and fountain drinks taste different but glass bottles also adds a different taste!
Where I live (Georgia), most people call it Coke, but I call it soda.
It's funny seeing as the caffeine flows, the speed of their speech gets faster and more excitable
E. Soft drink
*C i t r i c  A c i d*
Matt please tell me you drink water
D: fizzy/soft drink  is what I think we say in australia..
"Food Lion which you've probably never heard of"  *laughs in 'lived in Virginia my whole life'"
Food lion is actually a belgian brand. Here in Belgium it is called "Delhaize" after the founder's name. It is one of the oldest supermarkets out here
my only addition to this is, Matt needs to try other countries sodas of the same name. Example, American Diet Coke vs Australian Diet Coke vs British Diet Coke.
I actually quit coke all together at one point. I did so because of diabetes and oral hygiene.
try blue sky next time your in the colorado area
I’ve onley had stevia
Borland is organic and good for organic
I would use the zevia
I worked at the food lion I lived next to for like 2 and a half years lmao
From the south and have yet to hear ANYONE refer to all soda as Coke. Upstate of SC about 15 minutes from the NC line. Really starting to think it's a myth someone made up.
i was hoping to see Big K soda, its the only store brand soda ive had that competes with coke.
All three
D: in NZ we call it fizzy drink
Congrats on Quitting Diet Coke. However I do have a Challenge. So you found a great Diet Soda. But If you taste test all the Soda flavors which would win in tournament like this?.
Soda's always way better from the fountain
As a person from Georgia who regularly shops at Kroger, I can verify that their diet cola has exactly the same extra "bump" of flavor that y'all described.  I've been a big proponent of their store brand diet sodas for a long time, also including Diet Dr. K (Dr. Pepper) and Diet Citrus Drop (Mountain Dew).  I had never considered that Diet Big K cola might have citric acid as its "magic ingredient" that makes it good, but sure enough I looked it up and citric acid is on the ingredients list.  Thanks for making a great episode!
As i am also a massive soda consumer.  I 100% agree about the three types of soda and qualities.. however, doesn't that skew the results pretty massively? you wanted something you were able to regularly obtain. as far as i know you can only get fountain drinks... at a fountain... which isn't going to be installed in your house unless you want to shell roughly 4k to install one.
My allegiance has always been with Mountain Dew cuz the bottle looks like a modern day HP potion (or Poison Flask if you're feeling edgy)
I'm a soda guy
it's not diet, but the imported coca cola from mexico was my favorite. not available anymore *for some reason* but it was in a glass bottle and had cane sugar in it instead of the high fructose corn syrup. you could get it in a few of my local convenience stores a couple years ago.
I always try cheaper in house brands. For example the in house Oreos I can buy I like even a little bit more than Oreos and can be a bit to a lot cheaper, like you can get more than 2 packets for the price of one packet of Oreos.
We’re “Pop” people up in Montana
14:26 we have a food lion in virginia
You should do a video on what sodas are the best to mix to make a better soda
My Bride found a good-tasting Stevia.  It's 'Better Stevia Organic'. https://www.vitacost.com/now-betterstevia-organic-zero-calorie-powdered-sweetener-4-oz?CSRC=PPCADW-GGL_SEM_NB+PURE_US_PRO_DSA_Food+%26+Beverages_NA-&network=g&keywordname=&device=c&adid=39700047314268594&matchtype=b&gclick=Cj0KCQjw1PSDBhDbARIsAPeTqrdWOd6DvprdcWNp4aBU2YDlw1xTtD5UoiWDQ4bgOGCL55G2QEwvwB4aAq3lEALw_wcB&ds_agid=58700005322647340&targetid=&s_kwcid=AL!9700!10!%7bAdId%7d!%7bOrderItemId%7d&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1PSDBhDbARIsAPeTqrdWOd6DvprdcWNp4aBU2YDlw1xTtD5UoiWDQ4bgOGCL55G2QEwvwB4aAq3lEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
You said Food Lion and my mind immediately began thinking of groceries I might need since I go grocery shopping there a whole lot lol
I'm surprised caffeine-free diet Coke didn't make the cut, they had caffeine-free Pepsi in there. My mom used to only ever drank caffeine-free diet Coke and I remember the distinct flavor of warm flat soda on a hot summer day and me trying to sneak sips of soda back when it wasn't something I could drink all the time as a kid.
Boylan creme soda slaps
I'm d:other cause down here in Australia we call it soft drink
I'm very happy for you matpat, I understand the weight behind what you did when you realized your childhood obsession was just baiting you to find the taste you truly were seeking. Welcome to the complex game of the universe. Think of it on the quantum field level and you'll be looking into the Grand theory of all.
I'm sad that they all had to be cola, because diet A&W root beer is my favorite diet soda ever. P.S. favorite soda ever is regular A&W root beer.  <3
Food theory idea: This one might sound kinda boring but I’d like to hear what you have got to say about it because it’s been lingering in my mind since I was a kid...... the battle between Pepsi vs Coca Cola. ❤️🤍💙
C. Coke
B and A, soda pop
Stuff I adore coke zero as well, I feel for you!!!
I’m a pop
If I want to get one I’m gonna have to drive 151 miles ): if they sold the soda on Amazon business will be booming
Yeah boylan’s root beer is god tier
Im sorry, you guys make me feel so single! I cant express how perfect you two are for each other. I genuinely wish you two many more incredible years together 💖 I loved the video! Wild winner, who would've thought?
So Food Lion started from the South and moved on up. We have a crap ton in Maryland. I only shop in there for a friend. Walmart, Costco and Giant is where I go too. Where do you shop at for groceries?
Publix soda            Diet version
do a cootie theroy
matpat don’t agree with her she has cooties
as a casual sdda drinker, i would rather drink the regular with sugar rather than diet.
Does diet Sprite Waze
Diet DrPepper wasn't even on the list
I mostly shop at food lion and I love it!
This is the best out of the 3 theory channels
Me: drinks Diet Coke  Also me: *spits out* And last me: WHAT
I'm at work at food lion right now listening to this lol also in n.c.
I work at a kroger so my next day I have to try kroger brand cola
Coming from washington i can tell you QFC diet soda taste as you describe
No Pepsi Max? :(
Idk about everyone else, but I love how instead of theories that take a long time to make, we are seeing MatPat do fun food science experiments.
Just saying before I even watch this, my vote will always be Vanilla Coke.
Never, NEVER sleep on Kroger, it is a delightful store especially if you cook from scratch a lot as they have great ingredients. Not even surprised that you loved their cola
D: Other - Soft drinks (I'm British)
Pop. Midwesterner at heart, anyone else who says soda or coke to refer to pop is delusional.
Hey I know food lion we used to go there for groceries when we were visiting family in North Carolina
Pop! :)
I know food lion  it was like 75% of my childhood
they both have great reporter voices its kinda creepy
matpat should do a theory on what food product would make the best face mask. Like what oil, food, tea, etc.  is most beneficial for the face to soak up.
The problem I have with this thing is fountain soda varies wildly. With diet coke fairing second to worst above diet dp. While most sodas can be pretty drinkable depending on the fountain setup and water supply diet coke and diet dp are very often undrinkable.
I remember Food Lion! They used to have a few locations here in Oklahoma when I was a kid, but they all went out of business when the health department caught them selling spoiled meat that had been doctored up to look fresh. I remember the news reports. Man, I haven’t thought about that place in decades!
when I go to the beach at the obx their is food lions there
Food Lion isn't really the small North Carolina store chain it seems. It has been a part of Delhaize since 1974, now Ahold Delhaize, one of the largest grocer chains in Europe.
2 things though ... 1. i feel like the fruity flavour of the harris teeter that matpat loves rn, it's gonna get old really fast, and like 2 weeks later, it's not even gonna be noticed anymore. that's what happened with me and no one branded iced tea, there was a subtle flavour that i liked, and i stopped noticing it before i even finished the carton, then regular nestea just tasted just as good. and 2. if fountain diet coke won, would matpat actually go get fountain diet coke every time he wanted it? isn't getting fountain drinks really inconvenient compared to buying a pack of caned pop or a couple bottles of bottled pop?
The source of pop is definitely there I’ve noticed it too
I think im a soda/coke guy
you look like Barry Allen from the Flash
D:Diet Pepsi      peeeeepssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
they should try mountain lion, store brand mountain dew.
Fanta pineapple it’s like drugs to me try it
Conspiracy theory!!! Citric acid is government mind control additive!!!
Harris Teeter sodas are actually really really good, my friend's fridge is constantly stocked with Harris Teeter Diet Coke, and there root beer is some of the best I've ever had.
I’ve got a food 4 less near me, I guess I need to go buy their Diet Coke.
for the food chains that sell the Harris Teeter cola, the only brand i recognized was Food4Less lol, so i guess ima pick me up some diet cola from there lol
I say D for other, i prefer to call it...    G a M i N g F l U i d S u S t E n A n C e
Plot twist: as MatPat was filming this, Coca-Cola was FINALLY editing up the draft for their sponsorship.
Matt Pat is a Diet Coke connoisseur.
You should try out Senku Cola next. You make it yourself, mixing lime zest, lime juice, caramelized honey, and carbonated water. The best way of preparation hasn’t been decided by the community yet, but I figure you’re the one to  get it right.
Boylan creme soda is so good
As a British man I call it a fizzy drink
Diet Dr pepper
1 quarter left people
Why isn't it called Pepsi Max in the US?
"The nr 1 selling diet soda in the world" I have literally never seen diet coke in Europe
Someone update wikipedia, it thinks he lives in ohio
FUN FACT: STEVIA USED TO BE A RAT POISON, ITS NOT HEALTHY AT ALL 😃 it can cause long term digestion problems-
Boylan’s ginger ale is realy good
Stephanie kinda bad tho
England coke or faulty lemonade
in a pop person im in mn what did you expect
UK Midlands says fizzy drink ( 15:33 )
D /Dk
Definitely shouldn't have known which two you were trying. "We'll try our best to be impartial" doesn't cut it.
When they play rock, paper, scissors and get the same thing 6 times in a row, that's when you know they're meant for each other
Tbh these two are my favorite influencer couple and the fact that they tied 6 times in Rock Paper Scissors is just adorable
Well acidic ingredients like lemon juice and vinegar are know to enhance the flavors of a lot of foods/drinks ;though citric acid works even better because it doesn't have that strong lemony or vinegary taste so it can be used in most foods/drinks.
Here in germany we just call it Cola.
We have food lion in Maryland. I used to work next to one.
Drink kombucha it’s the perfect replacement
I’m a pop guy cause I live in Michigan
I’m from Australia and we say soft drink (idk why since carbonated drinks are anything BUT soft)
I love the representation for North Carolina
We call all sugary carbonated soda, softdrink in Australia.
Go drink Zevia. its the best and its water.
But why would you drink diet coke instead of regular coke in the first place? If you want an unhealthy thing anyway, just go for the real thing it tastes a 100 times better (even though coke tasted much better 10-15 years ago).
Australian here, we call it soft drink
Shocking 🤯
I don’t like coke
In Australia coke is referred to as coke, but like… only for the brand coke, if you want Pepsi you say Pepsi ect. In general sodas are called soft drink.
Normol Coca-Cola i dlise for me
i drink coke zero just as much as matt pats love for diet coke or at least as much as he used to
I’m not from the US where I live it’s ”Läsk” but i guess I say soda... (that’s what they said it was in English class.)
D. Cool drink
Mr. Pibb is the only correct choice
Don’t forget cococola with cocaine that used to be true
In Australia we call Soda “Soft Drink” Even though people still think of Soda when they say it
Who would win? A product of a multi-billion dollar, high quality corp or a fresh lil' product made on a home budget?
matpat, i love you and your content, but, dude, MUTE YOUR MICS WHILE YOU DRINK OR EAT EW
I grew up calling it soda.  My mom called it coke.  Dad, soda pop.  I called it soda because I didn't like coke as a kid
12:21 bizzare you say.... is this a reference to something
This was very interesting 🧐 😁
I call it soda. My friend calls it all coke. So like , she'll ask me to get her a coke, and I'll grab her one and she'll go, no like I want Dr pepper. And so I'll go out back the come and get some Dr pepper
Diet Coke a quick way to meet cancer
sprite is good
other
Here in Minnesota it's generally Pop but sometimes I say Soda Pop just cause it's fun to say.
I like Coke Zero
läsk is the name of a soft drink/soda/pop or whatever you want to call it!  could also be that i speak swedish...
I'm watching this as a girl who doesn't drink carbonated anything.
I my world, NO WAY a fountain cola beats either can or bottled cola. NO FN WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good thing too, the sweetener is said to cause cancer
20:27 When Matpat Starts to cheat on Diet Coke
I really like diet Dr. Pepper
Will try to get my hand on the food for less diet cola or whatever it was, hopefully it will be as good as you described it
Pop.
soda stream for me taste horrible
honestly, it depends. if it isnt just cola, we say soft drinks. otherwise, it's coke
15:29 I’m not an american
Okay, to be fair, Florida is kind of its own thing
Shasta? that's for shooting I think...
Just realised the peanut butter and jelly banana is in the background
Did y'all get a march madness sponsor???
Wot
Diet Dr. Pepper, dude.  Forget Cola.
Hey i just applied to food lion.
B
Both Boyland and 365 are actually pretty decent sodas when they aren’t diet, but after this video I went and tried them and I would have to agree that they are not good
Unless I missed it, what did you do to cleanse your pallet between taste tests? Some sodas after taste and ingredients could've influenced the second test, or even potentially the rest of the lineup.
Shes so right tho all our southern asses especially in Atlanta and GA call most carbonated beverages coke  also I was raised on Publix coke
"different died comes taste different" Mat-Pat Ah Yes Thé floor is made out of floor
Mr. Pib
Your red jacket also appeared on car wars aka doughnut media
Just drink normal coke no need for diet coke when you can workout
D : in Australia we call it fizzy drink
As a Kroger associate, I am *interested.*
We say drink in some places within Memphis.
I call it soda
I guess this is just one of those things I'm too European to understand
You guys should do more brakes for other foods and drinks, it would be fun
pepsi max tho?
As a person who drinks tea with Stevia ALL THE TIME, the flavor from Stevia is a taste you learn to acquire to over time. That and a balance of how much you add. I can understand how it wouldn’t be as good in a soda—not to mention be overpowering of the entire hint.   But, to be fair, it’s kinda hard to actually compare small brands that possibly don’t taste as good to something that is popular and a flavor you hold near and dear to your heart.   Edit: just finished the video. Wow. That ending was unexpected. I want to try that, but sadly, I wouldn’t be able to... seeing as it’s a small chain and I live in a small town.
soda coke
next food theory: i literally EAT FOOD!!!
Pop gang
SPRITE PICK SPRITE
I’m Canadian so over here we call it pop
Guess I’m gonna head to Baker’s tonight and see
BRUH I LIVE IN NC BUT I DONT HAVE HARRIS TETTER
Public cola sucks but the icecream is top notch
HERASY!
Where am I supposed to find Harris Teeter when I don't live in SC?
As the person who owns soda stream. You need to mix right amount of flavoring and carbonation so it tastes good.
I love Boylan 😭
I just realized that mr beast and matpat live in the same state
You guys are just to weak and young for the old and manly Boylan cola.
This is my favorite video you published. I love that you and Steph did the hunt for the best diet cola, so I'd don't have too. 😊
Pessi
I'm an A, I live in Canada, I say pop, but some call it soda too
bang energy  drink  will be better for you. also  good luck trying to sleep with on of this drink
Zevia is the healthyiest as it uses stevia. Its still not healthy but its a lot better than other sweetners or sugar. Some poeple do need to get used to it though.
Dude just drink water
Foodtheory idea:   What Classifies Something to be Food ?
I miss Coca-Cola Life. My local grocery stores stopped carrying it.
Pop pop pop
Best cherry drink when? I believe Cheerwine is on top
Also, when I drank soda harries teeter and pig wigglely brands were better than coke
As someone from NC, I embody the chaotic spirit of the south and when i go to a restaurant I say What sodas do you have and then the next time I’ll say what pop do you have just to throw the waitress off
It's Cola in Netherlands
I'd love to see their sale numbers for the month-ish after this was posted
Omg I didn't know you were in the Carolinas. I just moved from there.
Grew up in Kentucky and live in NC right now. It's coke.
no coke or nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

i want the cokeeee
i chose pop i say pop
You two are so cool and so attractive it's amazing
Steph at the end: °O°
Pop gang
Don’t you have Pepsi Max in the US?
The only decent diet drink is Pepsi Max
Pop
The Coke Company: We are announcing our bankruptcy after a loss of $1,000,000,000 in yearly revenue.
I have pop day
Couldn't find any Kroger brand sodas in Lithuania :(
Mat, you forgot diet water.
Food Theory: I QUIT Diet Coke! me: Clickbait.
who else calls it soda pop?
Quitting coke? I suggest a morphine as your replacement.
Other
pop
This is a love story.
im a soda-pop person my mom and brother are soda ppl and my dads a pop person so ig i just became a soda-pop person, anyone? xD
B
Did anyone see the multiple 7th and 13th place ranks in the versus?
I just watched two people talk about diet cola for 24 minutes XD
ive grown up on calling 'soda' 'coke' but people in my area call it 'pop'
DIET COKE IS MADE OF ABORTED BABIES
Grow a pair and drink regular soda.
diet fanta
12:07 to12:19 is when you eat school food
So basically you changed your coke addiction to another potentially worse addiction. Cool
an alternate title could be i quit coke. jk
pepsi max
From oz land! Soft drink
biggest plot twist of 2021 lmao
What have you done with matpat
As an east coast North Carolinian, it made me ecstatic to see the HT underdog come in first.
Food lion used to be in florida like 5 or 7 years ago
This isn’t a regional thing it’s a me personally thing, but I call all soda, Steve. And I’m not going to explain that
where is the glass diet coke?????
Food lion is not just a North Carolina based store, it is also in Maryland
Its pop to me. I'm originally from MN.
"im looking for a soda to replace diet coke" Me sees diet coke also me HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?????????
Soft drink
Orange juice
I am 탄산음료
In England we refer to soda as fizzy drinks, it makes me laugh cos we make fun of Americans for over-explanatory words like sidewalk or Fall, but but coke has bubbles so we call it “fizzy” 😂😂
b
Food theory idea:jollibee's secret its in Philippines thought
As a type 1 diabetic who has had to drink diet soda for 23 years, I really love the deep dive into the best diet options. P.S. I'm team Coke Zero because it tastes the most like real Coca-Cola
I'm from New Zealand and we call carbonated drinks  "fizzy drink" or "bottel of drink"or "can of drink" depending on what its in
Matpat: choosing Harris instead of diet coke and was looking for something else like zero Pepsi but he didn't find any and took Harris Me: mistakes aren't mistakes
I'm just gonna say, pop is much more descriptive than soda. The carbonation is more apparent than the sodium
I wish I could try this but alas, I live in México and have been denied a visa too many times when I just want to go to Disney. Also I'm not sure what Coke zero is sweetened in the US with, since here it just tastes like stevia.... Dang I hate stevia
The most surprising thing in this video is that Matt lives in North Carolina.
I think you should go for no soda because you have acid reflex and then you’ll need water
So called fountain should NOT have been included because you can't buy it in a store and it tastes different everywhere you get one - wow really made a mistake there I think but it is ok
On The Film Theorists, you should make a My Hero Academia theory about Overhaul and if he could survive his quirk.
Soda<Soft drink
MatPat would love the Coca Cola taste testing area in the Coca Cola factory/museum in Atlanta 🤣
Also. C
Food lion is actually also in Tennessee.
Me knowing all these stores he’s talking about: Mat your not alone 😂 also me: Mat I am pop too
Boutta go to Ralphs and pick up some diet cola, and then visit my mom in Virginia and get some Harris Teeter diet cola, will report
5:30 me too man. I immediately recognized the bottle and if the other was can, process of elimination leaves fountain. I miss soda
Boycott Coke!
Another another ANOTHER thing matpat is known for. Wario is 10 ft tall
I'm sorry, FOUNTAIN diet coke is your entry? FOUNTAIN? .... I'm a can purist over here.
Nice experiment; it definitely reminds me of my 6th-grade science project involving taste testing sodas and sweeteners. My only criticism of the experiment was that it didn't seem like you took water and crackers to refresh your taste buds between tasting the sodas, which is what I did for my science project. Other than that, nice work.
In Australia we call 'soda' either soft drink or fizzy drink
I showed my step-dad this and he went out of his way to buy me the Harris Teeter Coke. (It's hard because we live in the northwest)
Diet-rire now makes Australian cordial
Bravo he has moved on to a new addiction
A
I didn't call A B C or D I just drank water
"or, as grocery stores call them, Private Label products"  Morphe Brushes is sweating rn
Honestly Coke zero is my favorite zero sugar cola
I only drink diet soda, but never cola. I like variety. I go with Shasta because I can get diet orange, grape, root beer, (not) Dr. Pepper, (not) Mtn. Dew, lemon-lime, or cream soda regularly.
Coke zero
Ha, I've always know Citric Acid is KING!!  I eat that stuff by it's self, of course I love sour things, but still!
try guaraná or tubaina, a brazilian soda recommendation. Not cola, but still a fruit based soda.
I'm about as far south as anyone cares to get and I've never heard any say "what kind of coke do you want."
I’m popo
im an australian we just call it soft drink
dude who would want to watch this lmaoXD

ohio lives by the pop lifestyle
Just saying but coke in glass bottles really do hit different

. . .😶. . .y 😑                      Special here idiot
Never tried food lion coke before I wanna go there now
Yep, I'm from the south. Can confirm: we are chaotic. Also, this was definitely a shocking turn of events. Was on the edge of my seat.
People where live would be mad at me because they say pop instead of soda   Because if I say soda they say oh so you want baking soda
wait i have food lion in my town in ohio???
Does anyone else here say "Soda pop"?, Although I only say it half the time the other half is just "Soda"
Who are you and what have you done with, well, yourself
15:09 Top Pops:But i'm top pops    to clarify top pops is a funko pop youtuber
Did you know food lion is a Belgian grocery chain? I didn't know that either, and I live in Belgium. Might going to take some of their soda's from now on. If they barely lost against the #1 spot... might be worth a try!
First thing that comes to mind when thinking about something matpat's known for is "I just simultaneously whipped and nae naed!"
dude, go with something like Zevia. something that doesn't contain Aspartame.
Frys provides the same fruity soda as Harriet teethers.
19:07 Ok just don't do it 100 times; legend claims things get messy after 100 draws in RPS~
NOOOOOOOOOOO
12:20 ( jojo refrains)
My mom and Grandma call everything Coke but I say they're chaotic. I say soda.
15:30 C
If you want a really good grape soda, try grapico, or crush grape in anywhere except the deep south
I grew up calling all cola soda coke, never called it soda or pop. Kinda starnge names.
ima soda person i say soda
3:16 ah, yes... Saudi Arabia Coke
Pop
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm..... A,B,C,or D?                        Either one, but mostly B/Soda.
I'll be honest, North Carolinian sodas are always pretty good, probably due to the presence of the GIANT being Cheerwine. If they had a diet soda, I'm sure Matt might actually like it.
Citric acid  the new MSG?
"the north Carolina based supermarket FoodLion, which you've probably never heard of"  i feel insulted
CLUB
Hi food theorists
When I saw this title I thought "Well I guess the world is ending now...."
B
bruh i LOVE zevia
Yes Steph Coke zero all the way!!!!
Kofola  Doesn't taste too mauch like cola (less sweet, developed independently of cola), but I like the herbal flavour.
So ur not on a diet no more
Nobody:  Me: maybe the crusty crabs secret formula has citric acid in it 0-0’’
My local Michigan diet cola brand Faygo also has Citric Acid, time to compare with the Kroger brand, I'll get back to this comment soon.
Steph looks AMAZING in this video <3 Oh yeah, and there's something about soda or whatever...
In brittan we sometimes call them cold ones
Coke zero is best
fun fact Kroger and food lion, also share factories that produce similar products, so that might be why food lion and harris teeter did so well
Pop allthe way
I work at a Kroger matpat, and our store brand pop is actually really good. I particularly love our Coke Zero sugar version, diet orange, and root beer. I love trying new foods so I tried them all years ago and they’re dirt cheap anyway so I didn’t lose much but gained a whole new love of store brand pop
my favorite zero-calorie soda that you can get in North Carolina is either Diet Cheerwine or Mr. Freshy
A
We in Ohio call it pop. If you ask for coke they will give you Coca-Cola, nothing else
B
he is outta  his mind, he has lost his mind. He is drugged by the winning cola. Any psychologist who can help him in the comments
This is because Coca-Cola didn't sponsor him
Here in ok we call it beer for kids
This man has issues because as a kid I don't like the taste of soda and never will
What? No Moxie? Maine officially declares war. Not sure why. Moxie is actually pretty disgusting, but... I don't know. War because tradition, maybe?
D, im in indiana and no matter whre i go, it seems that they only ask for what dink youll like, along with what company they are with. pepsi or coke products
Hey man I’m in Virginia and I used to work for a factory and I did that with bread we made probably 20 different brands of bread all the exact same just with different labels

Soft drink personally is what we call it, or just the name brand. Or maybe fizzy drink? Idk, normally soft drink. I'm Australian though-
I say soda pop
Hey MatPat and Stephanie! My 10 yr son and I live in Wake Forest and, after watching your video, we had to try the Harris Teeter version...as I too am a lover of Diet Coke.  So we have to agree with you...the HT diet cola is really good!  It definitely has that fruity aftertaste!  I may be your oldest fan (almost 50...a YOUNG 50!) but I wanted to let you know how much my son and I enjoy watching all of your videos together.  You guys are great!  Many Blessings to your family❤️
Good job Mat Patt. I am proud of you.
I'm an aussie, and i never thought it was weird to universally call most soft drink (soda) coke, even if it isn't cola flavoured
18:01 He said 13th seed and it was 10th seed
hariss teeter is gonna be wondering why their diet cola sales are rising
Lol
I LOVE sprite ITS SO GOOODDD!!!!
This mat guy is kinda funny, good choice for a co host Steph!
I’m a soda person by that I mean I say soda not pop
Try out diet mountain dew
Also born and raised in the Carolinas here and it’s soda to me. Coke is a specific soda.
Food lion sodas are actually insanely good. Their Dr. Perky or whatever it’s called actually holds a candle to Dr. Pepper.
I never started Diet Coke. If a drink has diet written on it, my wooden nickel reflex kicks in. Is what it is, if calories were a thing in gas for example - could you imagine how ridiculous people would be about it? Diet gas. That’s where we’d be. Yeah. I don’t drink anything but tea and water anymore because diet or not, those other kinds of drinks are proven to make you feel bad and quite frankly aren’t very good once you’ve made the switch. If I’m gonna drink one or the other, I’m just gonna drink the real thing because why wouldn’t I? They’re both bad for me, so why not enjoy it for the essence of what it is?
Try sting soda
I- i just call them fizzy drinks
i grew up with it called fizz but that is in the uk
20:34 that’s the Harris teeter come back speech
IM SOFT DRINK
8:12 Matpat canonically eats paint chips, write that down people!
The 7th Round pick of the soda world    Only NFL fans get the joke
1:24 "We at Food Theorists do not support mass consumption of diet coke despite Matt's inexplicable ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis." Matpat r u ok-
Matt: You’ve probably never even HEARD of Food Lion  Me: *in Food Lion right now*
watch how the coke copany loses £3000 this year just because of this
5:29 If fountain enters the race and wins... then are you going to go to McDonalds on a daily basis or would you buy a fountain Diet Coke machine next to your desk? One criteria was to be available and for me to „be available“ it would include me being able to stock up on the product so I could survive being in quarantine with it.
I say fizzy drinks lol
H-E-B Diet Soda is the best!!! Missing out matt!
Sprite replace diet Coke with sprite
Coke Zero is where it's at.
12:23 Diet mountain dew is the same way, I honestly don't know how people can drink that stuff
Old ≠ better  I would know I made the mistake of drinking ginger beer
Shouldnt there be 2 1 seeds?
the reason fountain is sweet is it comes out of the same spout as the sugar drinks
suddenly my respect for matpat skyrocketed.... i can't tell whether its bc of the harris teeter thing or not though. I have a personal bias towards harris teeter...
Just a quick FYI, here in Mexico, we also call every soda drink Coca (Coke). As a funny example, when you're at a restaurant, if you want a Sprite, you order a Coca de Limón, or if you want a Fanta, you order a Coca de Naranja, and everyone knows exactly what you mean. Unless you want Pepsi. Pepsi SUCKS.
Was that a  Moody Blue Devil ? I live here
As a Diet Coke aficionado, I am kind of upset that none of those stores owned by Kroger are near me (I haven't even heard of most of them).
Soda
...just now realized HT and Food Lion are NC based
if you dont want to its ok
hay can you try sprite soda i promise it tast good 😊
No ya don't
we call it soda in Spanish and coke in English
Bull
I would love to participate in all of this, but I actually can’t drink pop. The carbonation literally make me cry.   Basically, I will start shedding tears. My nasal canals and throat does not agree with the carbon. 😕  The only “soda” I can drink is Brisk which had VERY little or no carbonation.
I am soda man
Mr beast and matpat live in North Carolina WOW
*I really wanna try Harris Teeter cola...*
Put it on the list of time travel predictions dude, go on.
Matpat... I WENT TO FOOD LION YESTERDAY AAAAAA
The fact that they matched on rock paper scissors 6 times means they are the perfect couple
pop
soda pop
Growing up in a lower-middle class house sams cola was the only soda in the house 80% of the thing that stuff feels like childhood
Hey, maybe you could like add or replace food theory with music theory? idk I just thought of that.
I'll save y'all time Harris teeter won
B
I'm from California and i always say "soda," although i think that the people who say "pop" or "coke" or whatever they call it, are crazy, i shall not yet attack them with my sledgehammer. Haha Just kidding, I am totally fine if someone calls it something different from what i do, i just think it's weird. 😂
YOU’RE IN NORTH CAROLINA TOO SO WE HAVE MRBEAST AND MATPAT NC IS FREAKING BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, good to hear you're moving away from coke and their bigotry
Don't forget his constant headbuttung with the evil Disney corporation.
I live in Northern Ireland and every drink is a "tin of juice" here!
Pop
FRESCA is the answer!
I think I say either soda or "fizzy" most of the time (fizzy only at home)
Here they just call it cold drink yeah just cold drink
Fizzy pop. I grew up as a fizzy pop kid.
If you go onto coke and there sells you can see it goes down very drastically due to Mat not buying
"WE AT FOOD THEORISTS DO NOT SUPPORT MASS CONSUMPTION OF DIET COKE DESPITE MATT'S INEXPLICABLE ABILITY TO DRINK HOUrS ON AN HOURLY BASIS"
My family just calls drinks by their name. Example, "you want water or Root Beer?"
If only they took a trip to Australia to try Pepsi Max... I don't think a bracket would even be needed.
б
As an Australian, I find it strange when ppl call it pop or soda because Its called soft drink down here but I get it, most viewers are from the USA
Wisconsin man here with soda. Nobody around here calls it pop.
Never bought soda from it, but Fry’s is my local Kroger. Didn’t know that Kroger had more than just itself and Fry’s!
I want matpat to do a game theory on how to statically win rock paper scissors
As soon as he said Whole Foods was in the competition, I knew they would loose! XD  Mom used to work their and they were horrible employers, but that’s besides the point. They are overpriced, but that’s due to their food being really natural. Natural healthy food tends to taste horrible, sadly :/
I grew up calling it pop. The Mrs called it soda. I now call it soda pop.
I watched this video when it first came out, then I went shopping and bought the store brand Diet Cola since my closest grocery store. I must say Matt, that Diet Cola was *really freaking good*
A:pop
I really thought Harris Teeters and Food Lions were more wide spread
Seeing this during April made me think this was an April fools episode
Fountain drinks always taste better than any other form of that drink.
Laughs in Coke Zero.
23:15 I've never heard of any of those stores, but I guess it's because I live in the middle of the Pacific in the 50th state
Raspberry Diet Coke?
Me in Alberta..... soda pop
I grew up a “cold drink/cole drank” kid in New Orleans.
15:28 Uh... I'm a root beer lol.
pop gang  although i only drink water
This is weird
I call soda brands what ever the brands called not pop and stuff coke is coke sprite is sprite
My friend I saw no diet cockta I am crying that stuff beats coke by a km
I'm not usually this petty, but here goes. "WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY WATER? IT IS SO MUCH HEALTHIER THAN SODA. OR IF YOU REALLY CAN'T BRING YOURSELF TO ABANDON FIZZY BEVERAGES, TRY SPARKLING WATER. Bubly is pretty good"
wanna know whats wired i grew up with pop and soda i say soda tho but my sister says pop so a. and b.
pop
im other we call it or i call it only me i call it bubblie stuff
Lol 😂 18:55
IT"S POP!!!
I literally am using this right now as my scientific experiment in school
maybe soda stream sugarfree is different in europe, but I like it :)
Secret Ingredient for the Krabby Patty: Citric Acid.
Me: Wasn’t this leaf green before?  “Mat pat made a video about food comas”  Me: what?  “He has quit Diet Coke”  Me: Wh-what?!
Yeah coke zero gang
In the UK I think most of us call it "fizzy drinks". Pretty self-explanatory lol. When a restaurant asks for what you want they just ask what drink you would like.
D. Soft Drink
Mat...I hope you realize that the Harris Teeter diet cola COULD EVENTUALLY CHANGE, due to the contract timeframe & negotiations when the contracts are up Sooooo I’d say keep that in mind & see if you can find out who/where that product is bottled from to see if you can support that factory/company DIRECTLY if possible
B.
🥤
I saw diet rite and was like: "Omg he featured the stuff my mom and sometimes I drink! Holy crap i thought that only my mom and I knew about it!" Though I prefer diet rite flat, it's still pretty good carbonated.
We have Harris T and Kroger here in Nashville. I'll check them both and report back.
SPRIIITEEEEEE
Coke
As someone who works at Kroger I have some very specific insight here that might be able to help.       If you don’t put your cart in the cart corral you are an awful person and made a bagger somewhere cry.
As someone from the Midwest it’s fucking soda
Soda
What I learned - The fancier the soda the worse it tastes.
Food Lion is the best! We have some down in SC.
I shopped at the Food Lion while I lived in Maryland, and it certainly made me a believer in house brands.  A lot of their house brand options are better than national brands.
Drink sprite
Lllllloooooooooollllllllllllll
Matpat is a champ
I knew I recognized Food Lion's logo although I don't even live in the States. Turns out it has a chain in Romania (where I grew up) called Mega Image.
D
Listen I'm from Southern Kentucky so firmly between North Carolina and Ohio longitudinally speaking and everybody I know calls it pop, no one I know calls all pop "coke" I have never heard that in my life every.
I need the background music in the championship round
B: its soda only soda
I’m coccain gang.
I'm pop
I was raised saying soda-pop, never heard anyone else call it that
OMGsh. I live just down the street from a Pick ‘n Save (one of Kroger’s brands). Will check out their store brand ASAP. 😬
It's all soda or Coke here.  NO POP.
What’s the Harris Teeter sweetener?
For coke FENTIMANS is my choice of drank
Soda all day
we call it "frisdrank"     go guess what language it is
Glass bottle coke is superior
Last year I was having bad stomach cramps and I cut my soda of choice (Coke Zero or cherry Coke Zero) out of my life in favor of water which then switched to me drinking water with fruity Mio (water flavoring) flavors that also has some caffeinated components. Honestly, I don’t miss pop and I’m been feeling a lot better without it.
I throw a comment... Please try " GREEN COLA " If you consider changing... I think , its the only cola worth to drink as healthy alternative! No sugar, no artificial sweetener as aspartame or saccharine, just natural stevia and natural caffeine from green coffeebeans. And the taste is absoluteley acceptable. The cola is origin in greece, but is also availabe in the uk and germany in stores and online everywhere else even in the states i guess...  Sorry if this sounds like commercial, but i am just a very satisfied customer  ... and if you dont get it there... MOVE
My mom didn’t let me drink coke when I was younger. I was like “ok” So glad she did I’m pretty glad I’m not addicted  to it
Try Tab
We have food lions in Georgia
Hmmm... If it's not 35% alcohol content, I call it WATER...
My mom used to get so mad when we had Pepsi and I said pass me a coke pls
In the UK we call it fizzy
PEPSI,FANTA,STONY,SPRITE
Boyland is probably my favourite soda brand, either that or Jones
Fizzy drink (rule Britannia)
stevia is awful, especially on hot drinks. stevia in tea? gross. stevia in coffee? vomit inducing. it's better to drink them without sugar than drinking them with stevia.
where's diet rite
Be careful not to tie 100 times in rock paper scissors or a monster will appear and take your prize!
Diet Pepsi XD
we call it softdrink in the philippines
pepsi max is my drink of choice
No, boylans sucks, I’ve had their root beer and it tastes just as bad
Really thought this was gonna be some theory on why diet coke is extremely unhealthy that it even got you to quit. 😅  Not disappointed by the results. 😂
a pop
C: Coke. And I’m from NC, I’m very familiar with Food Lion :P
You can physically see matpat contemplate his life when he realize he like another soda beside Diet Coke
See, i'm from Minnesota in the MidWest but i grew up calling it Soda mostly from my dad from Duluth but also one of my parents from Cleveland called it Pop which never really stuck.
Sweat drink 🇹🇹🇹🇹 Trinidad
The best Coke always comes in a glass bottle. -An addict
Me ( a southerner) to my friends :You wanna coke ? Friends : yeah grab me a mnt dew Jk what are friends
This is milwaukee wisconsin made to me the best specher
*Impossible*
NC REPRESENT!!
Fanta
I got two words:  sams cola
Fizzy pop 🥤
Me: their like da same thing 😂
Wait...Publix isn’t in other parts of the world??? My life has been a lie
in Trinidad 🇹🇹 it's called sweet drink, pronounced "SEEJINK"
I didn’t know you where in NC like me nice
Here in Germany we are Group C. Coke. :-)
I'm from Canada so the default is Pop! Unless you're talking cream soda (which should be pink)
Steph when May says something is better than Diet Coke: 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Am I the only one that knows Food Lion from Mr. Beast buying everything from it?
your wife is realy attractive just so you know bro
E
get yourself some sweet corn flavored soda
Fountain drinks are the best
1:30 almost what all parents do
I’m from the Midwest and I call it pop or soda but it depends on my mood
Fun fact: Soft Drinks are Drugs
d: kola
me: literally dying because of the rock paper scissors game XD   I AM DYING OF LAUGHTER BECAUSE OF THAT
CANON LORE?!!!?!?
I'm watching this while drinking coke lol also I love coke
I feel like this would have worked better if they werent told at the time what the bracket looked like. Have somebody else set it up, do all of the pouring, just give them the basic "A vs B" and then show them the completed bracket at the end.
fry's gang
i was only rooting for harris teeter for one reason. it's because one of my closest friends name is harrison
I never actually realized just how big his addiction was until i learnt the premise of this video
If they did want to do another soda episode, they wouldn't need to go on a "Long road trip," he could just ask the subscribers. We are all nerds, and we all live in places with our own market brands. He could use his audience.
I love coke zero, but MatPat seems to love the harris teeter brand. I will probably try it soon to see if it really tastes as good as he claims
Coke sells poison to millions of people with its sugar and high fructose corn syrup sweetened products, and its version of ethics is to support voter fraud.  Just say NO! to Coke
D. Other. Soft Drink gang rise up!
You see what happened was that the harries teeter coke was like “oh so you pick me just to see me lose ok I’ll win out of spite”
B. I grew up in Maine but I don’t think we call it “soda”. I honestly don’t remember.
As someone who watches good mythical morning, once Mat mentioned Kroger, it all made sense
Where is the Diet Coke in a glass bottle??
Glass bottle diet coke (I live in texas so it might not be near you)
This doesn't surprise me at all! In the northeast we have the grocery store Giant, and my family holds that the Giant brand "Dr. Bob" is better than Dr. Pepper. We have introduced other friends from around the country to Dr. Bob and they agree!
D: other. Soft drink
sodaaaaaaaaaa
I've had Kroger's DIet Cola. Not as good as Coke proper, but definitely good.
As a person who moved from North Carolina, hearing all these brands from the state on this channel is just a blast from the past. Thank you mat!
Matpat:quits Diet Coke Coca cola:"plays 'sadness and sorrow' from naruto"
I didn't know it was possible to be so invested in a diet coke competition. I don't even like coke.
Boyoln My brother got a bottel of root beer for his birthday and it rastes like cough syrup
I'm a Midwest-raised pop person, too MatPat
me: thinking the fountain one was like a water fountain the editor putting a picture in. me: oh I feel dumb
15:30 B
Cold Drink...
I am d how l say it is 可口可乐
What a shocking conclusion.
soda and pop are good names but coke?
As a north Carolina resident myself, we got decent diet cokes.
wish there was 1 more team
B
The lewd niece probably soak because sale methodologically multiply abaft a scary radar. lean, spurious toothbrush
What about diet R.C. cola
Hey food lion be doing good
Food Lion isn't actually restricted to the carolinas, there used to be one where I lived in Florida, and one where I live now in WV.
Why does drinks from the fountains hit different
B
I'm from the mid west too. But I've always been a soda guy. I think I had a coke phase as a kid, but besides that I say soda or the name of the drink.
MatPat!!!! Ever since this video came out all of our local Harris Teeters are completely sold out of their pop! It was our go to and now we can't find it! Why, MatPat?!?? WHY!?!?
A for sure since I was born in columbus ohio and grew up in canton ohio
While it is true that aspartame causes cancer in larger quantities per amount of time, it won’t build up per month so it is safe to drink things with aspartame.
I really like blue zevia, like A LOT
I’m sorry matpat, I put all that effort into making a matpat Diet Coke pitch to coke.
A man tries what diet cola soda he likes the best. 2,7 milion people: Interesting...
i love me some diet coke
And here I was expecting you to need to make a second episode to determine which of your local fountains had the best mix of diet coke.
The viewers:NOOOOOOOOO you can't just replace diet coke MatPat:Diet Coke replacement goo brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Dudes got tinny 'S's.  They must be friends 🤣
Drink ONLY water.  Besides a coffee to wake up.  Water is the ONLY liquids that you should drink.
In Australia 🇦🇺 it’s just called soft drink
“Never heard of a food lion”... no we just pass it and go to food city

Soda water
A fan from Guam here. My grandparents always called soda drinks "coke"
Lol, the way that you described the Harris Teeter soda is eerily similar to how the Big K Cola tastes, so it's quite possible that they're the same. Could also be that Ohio upbringing showing itself in your preferences too. X3
Similar to the whole store brand thing, if you want a makeup product and aren't completely sold on a specific brand, get either the Sephora or Ulta brand. Usually they're just as good as the other brands, and they're usually less money.
I lived in Virginia, and we had our own Harris Teeter. I've never tried their soda, but their sugar free sugar cookies (I have no idea how they did that one) were always SO GOOD! They were in a little box of samples at the exit of the store, and I got one on the way out every time I went there as a kid.
**checks the ingrideints of Harris teeter than sighs. Ofcourse he likes it it has aspartame in it like diet coke.
Matpat: I quit diet Coke Me: So you found the correct path and get the regula......never mind he is just lost in the labyrinth again. Also Me: Wait they don't have glass bottles in US for Coke? Ouch
What mojo top 10 saddest breakups
I hate Diet Coke
i think this video is a meme  cuz there is no way after all of these years he leave diet coke
Don't know if it's worth a food theory but what kind of favour even is dr pepper? I've been drinking it for years & I still can't put my finger on it, my closest guess would probably be marzipan 🤔
We in Vietnam call soda or any other beverages nước which mean water So when we go to like a cafe or something The barista will always ask us Uống nước gì which mean what kind of water do you want
I guess we'll be getting an episode around citric acid at some point now lol
We get different Kroger brand sodas at our house fairly often.  There is an old fashion style orange cream that I'm a fan of.
Pop. Totally a midwest thing
You forgot thums up bro try it
I'm from North Carolina, so Coke. Why would I be calling it Pop? Please let's be civilized here
3:46 I swear I misheard that, but the captions tell me what I misheard is what he said.
Matt talking about the flavours from different sources is like markiplier ranting about talkies
Me when I see anime 12:20
coke brothers
Pop.
I live in Houston Texas and we call it soda. Never heard someone call it coke
I don't think diet sodas are any better than normal sodas, I also think they taste awful
I tried the king soopers brand diet cola, and it tasted very similar to what you described. It was very good.
When I live in Kentucky but I have been to Florida so may times that I have had the “Public’s Diet Soda”
I'm a root beer man
Hol’ up you live in NC?! Also now I could really go for a Diet Pepsi... ☺️
i have a model of the USS North Carolina in my room
matpats inpreshun of diet coke: no! we need the money from his wallet to get to the top soda brands!!!!!!!!!
diet coke: nnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait what.
Smith's Kroger Brand "Big K" Diet Cola is definitely the same. MatPat is right, it DOES have a really nice fruity finish. And I've always been a Diet Coke fan, but this IS probably a bit better.
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
14:40 ha! I have a few Food Lion near me in MD. Also some of my family from NC lives in a town with a Food Lion (it used to be Food Town).
MatPat Drink This 365 Days A Year  MatPat Like 10 Seconds Later This Is Terrible

I’d love to see more things like this. And the fact Steph calls him “Matthew,” is incredibly wholesome to me, for some reason.

Coke orange vanilla is my Kryptonite as Mountain Dew is for the serious Esports competitor.
unironically "rock rock rock" is my favourite game
i suppose water wasn't an option lol
I lived in NC for a few years and it became more of an effort to shop somewhere besides Harris Teeter’s. Funny thing, when I first moved there I had a hard time finding a grocery store (pre-smart phone) because I drove by the Lowe’s, more than once, thinking it was home improvement with weird signage.
It’s clear after the Rock Paper Scissors game you two are made for each other 🥺
MatPat: Says that we’ve probably never heard of Food Lion. Me, who lives near a Food Lion: Laughs in Maryland
Oh noooooo! Not Boylan! This is why you include Root Beers MatPat! Boylan is one of the better root beer brands I've enoyed. I am basically the Root Beer version of Diet Cola MatPat XD
We buy Shasta cola wich is good, but I've never had there diet and don't plan on it.
Diet sodas are complete garbage.
D - Other: Mum said I’m not allowed
In new mexico everything is coke you wanna coke can mean anything from sprit to fanta
Yo hold up I thought matpat lived in la
3:45 captions on im sorry
I'm so used to popular youtubers liviing in like, the west, so it's really weird for such a big person being in north carolina
fun fact, quite often the store brand is made by 1 of the top manufactures , and possibly the one you already buy. They just sell it for a little less under the store name to push more product. My dad worked for a company that provided a generic version that was the exact same product as the more expensive one, just without their brand on it. This was in the day before every store had a store brand.  Usually nothing wrong with the store brand.
6:09  "Yeah, and Florida."  Steph's not wrong. As someone that grew up there, I can confirm that _a lot_ of my fellow Floridians treat shopping at Publix like a religious experience. 😂  Also, I'm D: Other. Other, in this case being, Both B & C. I'm convinced calling everything "Coke" as a catch-all came from wanting to shorten "soda" in the South, and we simply _refused_ to call it "pop".
Badlandchugs has entered the chat
We have food lions in VA
Number 1 CANNED DIET COKE IS THE BEST YOU CAN NOT PROOVE ME WRONG
D in England they are just called fizzy drinks or cola
im with steph coke zero has been consistent for years. its too sweet unless you freeze it or chill it with ice. diet coke has fell off because it used to be incredible. washed it down with some crown royal rye, it was perfect.
idk why near the end i thought about how good looking their kids will be
diet pepsi is always hit or miss for me
Me from Virginia who went to Food Lion every Sunday...
diet coke last gen was like crack. been drinking mostly coke zero until vanilla diet coke with extra caffeine. so now im ok with diet coke. last gen diet coke probably just had more caffeine. maybe its the aspertame
Yay Steph! I'm a big coke zero fan too.  I'm gonna try out a local brand though now, see if I can capture some of that Harris Teeter magic in Calgary,  Canada 🇨🇦 (I'm doubtful)
Mouton dew
The different sizes of straws anger me
no Diet DR.Pepper? :(
haha diet coke funny
Am i the only one who called it "Fizzy drink" or just the name of the soda-
I live in Texas, so I live right by a Kroger store. Wow! I thought that Kroger was some local, county store, but it's a company that owns many nation-wide stores. And I know that Kroger has a Kroger Signature brand which includes cola and other things.  For all of you, Texans, Kroger Signature cola is the best cola ever! (According to MatPat)
18:42 The cutest couple in the WORLD!!!! 😍
My mom is a store manager at a fry’s so I’ll ask her about Harris Teeter
Imagine he just goes to Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke lmao
Soda

You two are an excellent team. Praise JESUS

Did you KNOW Food Lion and Harris Teeter are in South Carolina
In Montreal, Canada. My favorite diet Cola is called "Selection Diet Cola" it is a store brand and yes has the same ingredients as the teeter one, you guys had.
I live in Florida
I say both soda and pop
15:31 drinks
The fact the local version were better than some of big brands remembers me something. In Brazil we have Guaraná (a fruit that turns into a soda with the same name) which is the most famous one. (And yes it is the same Guarana that energetic drinks have) But every small city has their own version, and some of my favorites sodas are the small ones. Lol
Representing NC
I say coke but if I am talking to other people (not my family) I say soda because they dont understand when I say coke
pop
here is where your wrong diet coke is disgusting
have you ever tried a good ol cuppa tea? im not talking earl grey or any of those fancy things, English breakfast tea. Tetley, PG Tips, Yorkshire tea?  Hot water, 1 sugar and a dash of milk for colour. done
You were wrong in the beginning, the diet coke should only have been the 2lt diet coke fountain is different with regard to its gas mix. By putting a fountain drink in its an unfair comparison
Soda
B duh
B for the quiz
Should have been a blind taste test. Would've been a better and less biased tournament.
I am learning that North Carolina has two of my favorite places to go aside from traditional chains (in the form of Food Lion for stores and Cookout for fast food). Good job, North Carolina
To be honest all diet sodas....arent as diety and healthy as they would leave you to believe if you see this comment mat i just gave you a free video ;)
i was hoping pepsi max was gonna do better but still super surprised the last minute fill in took the win, thats some destiny stuff right there
In Britain we call it Fizzy drinks. Because it is a fizzy drink.
I say coke down in Britain
That Rock Paper Scissors was so good! Lol
how about sodapop unite the world!
Great! None of those Kroger stores are anywhere near me 😠😫
Oh, Bull! you put a fountain coke against canned and bottled varieties of every other soda on account of it tasting better than sodas from other sources. Nice handicap.
Nc for life
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
This man can recognize the sound of a Diet Coke truck backing up
hey for the first elimination test you forgot to add glass bottle Diet Coke because it has a very distinct taste from the rest of which I would argue would be the best
I live in the south, and I am weird, and call it soda.
Other.
B
can i go to the south? because im sick of hearing "is pepsi ok?"  NO it isnt. i wanted a coke
coke
regular coke. no science it just tastes like heaven
A: Pop for life. Lived in Minnesota my whole life.
WAIT i live in nc and i didnt know that foodlion was a nc thing das crazy
Aspartame is the most studied food additive ever and no legitimate scientific study has ever found anything concerning about it. It's not 100% healthy but it's a million times better than sugar. Everyone uses aspartame as a scapegoat but sugar is literally worse by every metric  Aspartame might cause a headaches in 1% of the population. Sugar literally kills people who drink tons of it everyday.
when none of the grocery stores that are Kroger related are close to you
Yay wooooooooooooo
I am not a soda drinker, however Wegmans brand anything is hands-down better than any other store brand, and sometimes even better than name brand! (Try W O's and TRY to tell me they're worse than Oreos.) So I would love to see how W Diet Soda stacks up.
I am D. Let's go soda-pop!
Can I have some cola
I call it a fizzy drink her in England
Ya when I moved from Wyoming to TN everyone looked like was weird when I called soda Pop
me before watching the vid : its zero sugar pepsi isnt it !!!!! >:(
Well I was born in the north and grew up in the south so I sorta switch between "soda" and "pop"
Finally some one who gets it diffrent sources taste diffrent that is true with all soda
Why is there no mention of diet mntn dew or diet sprite
I call it zzzz because that's what I called it as a toddler lol
D: Other--- Soft drink.
Other - fizzy juice or (whatever its named)
Buy Dr thunder diet
This is a sort of torture for me, im intolerant to coke (cola)
I'm not surprised. I'm an avid cola zero drinker, but I take the one from my local supermarket. The actual coke zero I used to drink is sweeter and I prefer the heavier carbonation and more acidic and strong taste of the supermarket one (Jumbo brand, for anyone in NL). And it's a good thing that I prefer it because it's third of the price of the branded coke zero, which is why I tend to stray from branded things in the first place. It does use aspartame tho.
drink coke that’s simple
LET’S GO. FL AND PUBLIX getting representation
Did anyone else notice that in the intro it says "MatDonald's" instead of "McDonald's?" 0:14

In Australia we call it a fizzy drink
I call it pop. I live in the state tht makes Faygo: Michigan.
ok this might just be me but stevia tastes like the colour green
I feel like even if Matt talks about the most boring topic ever he would still get me interested
never in my life would i ever thought to be amazed by a soft-drink tournament arc
Terminology: mom's from the Northwest, says "Pop".  Dad's from the North-East, says "Cola". I grew up in the south, said "Coke" until I went to work in Texas, now I say "Soda".
at 7:42  I almost died of laughter
bepis
He's aware of his addiction, at least. His videos on casino, Candy crush, etc addiction give him no excuse. He has a sense of responsibility, at least.
How mad do you think these companies are now that MatPat has declared his distaste for their soda?
Those monsters who disliked are
Steph is such a good and chaotic force and I'm so glad she's been in more videos because your chemistry is so good 😊
You just wanted to buy a bunch of soda and write it off as a business expense.
gmm vibes lol
it was  called beverage in our country
Soda
Coke Zero is so much better than Diet Coke
soda
Fizzy drink That’s what most kids call soda in Australia
As a virginian who shops at both harris teeter and food lion, and has enjoyed both of their diet sodas, I'm glad to see them perform so well.
......its soft drink, how are we even discussing this
Am I the only one who thought that "Shaftsa: Loser Flavor" and it's slogan "It kinda sucks!" seams like something that should be in the FNAF universe, based in FNAF VR's edible prizes. (not throwing shade at Shasta; love their Tiki Punch)

15:30 coke and fizzy drink and soft drink
Since I've had braces I've learned diet coke is just mildly flavored fizzy water
everybody gangsta it'll MatPat pulls out the Harris teeter
Pepsi is almost the same as Pepsi soooo

I'm replacing speed pills with coke. Thanks MatPat
Soda i am soda but I don’t like pop soda coke whatever I like juice water Powerade and Gatorade my mom kompot from Russia 🇷🇺 also I kinda dislike the russian candy with fizzy stuff in the center
Just go a soda stream commercial after they judged it
You probably won’t see this but the cab cola is actually really good
Matpat: Doesn't pick diet coke in the finals Diet coke: TRAITOR!
Honestly here in Australia we call all “soda’s” soft drinks.
Hyper Coke is pretty good
I am glad that cough syrup is regarded as the go to thing to compare something bad tasting to world wide.  Also I'm going with D. Other. Where I'm from they call it "soft drink". We call Coca Cola, Coke and Pepsi well Pepsi.
The winner is obvious,       It has to be Pepsi
I’m c
Pop
We call them fizzy drinks or soft drinks in Australia.
We have Food Lions in Virginia soooo I think I’m gonna try their coke now😂
Food lion is a southern brand? I thought that was a West Virginia only brand
I honestly do a mix between Coke and Soda. If I'm talking about cans, I say Coke. If I'm talking about bottles I say Soda. Does anyone else do the same of some sort?
I am now upset no Kroger brands are in New Hampshire
Virgil’s rootbeer
I am a soda guy
Ohio pop

Makes sense to me. I switched to Kroger sodas after trying one.
Some people In NJ state call soda "Bath Popper" Idk why
me when big8 wasn’t here: *oh.*
good
A. Pop  B. Soda
I work at Kroger and I only knew about Jay C being owned by Kroger. Also, drinks aren’t the only Kroger name brand item we sell and some of them from what I’ve seen do look like other products on our shelves that might have came from the same factory as the Kroger brands.
pop is what I use when referring to...pops. and hearing that the south US uses coke as a general term. I may confuse them if I ever went down there, since I generally say coke or pepsi at restaurants when asked what kind of drink
You guys could’ve done DIET RC!!!

You to are ment for echather rock rock
You to are ment for echather rock rock
I'm not a huge fan of coke, but if I do have some I'd like to drink mine as a 50/50 mix of Coca-Cola and Fanta orange. This is similar I guess to adding citric acid to coke, which is apparently just a really good idea
I am personal A
Just drink Pepsi Max, Pepsi Max is better and is better than regular Pepsi!!  *This is just my opinion, don't come at me please*
In South Africa we call it mineral
Lmao who's gunna tell this man that food lion and cookout aren't just in NC.....
15:29 My answer is on behalf of most of Ireland. D. We call them fizzy drinks or soft drinks.
I personally call it Fizzy juice 😳🤚🏻
I live in Alberta, Canada and almost everyone calls it pop but I didn’t really talk to other kids when I was younger and adapted my speech patterns from a combo of books and YouTube and also in this case reading labels I always called it soda and as a result everyone thought I was weird
Seattle based brand Jones Soda is one that's good that you may have missed. I've already done all the searching up on it too. Cola flavored, no flavor additives, 0 calories, and most importantly, available in North Carolina. Given the ingredients that it has in it, I would take a guess that it has a flavor similar to the winner, seeing as how it *also* contains citric acid. (On top of that, it also doesn't contain aspartame if you're looking for that) The only real downside that I found to it is that it's more on the expensive side of things.  But if you're *Jonesing* for another contender, I would say that this is most certainly a strong pick.
I really think you should pick it back up in support for Coca-Cola since they voiced their opinion and the GOP is trying to boycott them
Plot Twist: Matt Pat got sponsored by Coca-Cola and the bottle of diet coke is actually diet-Pepsi
good for you but I never ever drank Diet coke!
Dr Pepper is my Diet Coke, and I can confirm that soda fountain, can, and bottle all taste different
imma soda guy
Brooo Harris Teeter rocks, but I've only been to ones near Tyson's Corner
Back in my home state that’s located in the east, we would call it soda but now I’m in the Midwest and everyone calls it a “pop”  I still call it soda tho
5:10 Das ist doch Hännos Outromusik 😅
19:36 his voice just shakes when he realized that Diet Coke wasn’t as good as  the other coke
citric acid is the secret ingredient in crabby patties!
I am a proud "soda" man hailing from Kansas. Then again, my mom grew up in the southwest and my dad on the opposite end of the state to where I was born, so I might be a rare breed

The Universe Called mattpat and said "HEY!!!... try this it's the best diet coke"
soda
I perfor soda fountain
Drink water
Honestly, I often find that store-brand products are better than name-brand. It seems kinda strange, but that's how it is for me. Store-brand crackers, mashed potatoes, mayonaise, soda, it's just all better than name-brand.
Best diet coke in the world is Pepsi Max! But im not sure of it's availability outside Europe  :)
I’ll head to Smith’s & let ya know
so matpat is applying to be the third member of good mythical morning 😆😆
just drink water it has 0 calories 0 sugar and it slaps believe me
Soda 100% and im in the south lmao
When the time comes, I'll go to my local Fred meyers and try their diet cola, and maybe try their lemon lime soda?
This was legitimately interesting to watch as someone who didn’t like carbonated drinks until I was 16 or so. While I can mostly differentiate between drinks now, i had a long history of making people mad because Dr. Pepper, Coke, and Pepsi all tasted the same to me. But I still can’t taste some of the subtle differences like Matt can and it boggles my mind
Quite a fast you went through MatPat, I'm kind of curious why?
other: i call it fizzy drink
shouldnt have revealed the identity of the winners until the end.

15:29 D: Gasified brown liquid
MatPat x Harris Teeter. Simply meant to be.
MatPat: “we’re not allowing colas with other flavors like fruit added in” Also MatPat: hehe citric acid go yum
This was a roller coaster ride throughout. I haven't seen a more edge-of-your-seat cinematic experience since Endgame
Being from the East Coast, the idea of never having heard of Food Lion is insane!! There's a Harris Teeter near me, I'm gonna have to check the cola out! Also, it's soda!
well i do know kroger owns ralphs
Just 3:49 with cc on
Fountain soda tastes like cardboard
I want a drink now
Why only 3 types of coke? what about glass bottle coke? In my opinion that's the best ones
I’m from ohio to but I call it soda
he drank diet coke on the hot ones video
Fizzy drinks/soft drinks in the UK. My grand dad does call them all coke but I think thats like home calling all gaming systems "the Nintendo"
How about 🥛 (MILK)
You know here in Quebec I call soda “hdhdjtjdjfjrndjfirnrjcjrnrnf”
Matt kinda sounds like graystillplays
You do know Pepsi is from NC too... So Food Lion beating it is still NC beating NC... And food lion is boss for generics...
...I call them fizzy drinks/soft drinks. I'm from England. That’s what we call them.
NC Strong 💪🏼
im mad my fab soda is dr pepper cream soda >:(
D. in the UK we call it a fizzy drink or soft drink.
For the other folk in NC, how's the Chinese food restaurant by your local food lion?
BORDERLANDS ZERO IS MY FAVORITE
diabetes: HERES DIABETES    MatPat: NOOOOOOOO
Well, in Mexico, in the states that border the US, we actually use the word "soda" -always, even the elderly-, if you say "soda" in other states nobody will know what you're talking about as "soda" doesn't exist in Spanish really, they assume it's just gibberish lol
Diet root beer is the most gross beverage to ever exist
My favorite cola is Faygo Cola and I wish you were able to try that one, but it's only in MI :(
Soda
I’m sodies
Also remember that Pepsi was made in North Carolina.
Your not wrong and actually as a Fry’s night stoker I can even tell you a good chunk of are branded food is also packaged by others famous companies and can even be the same product like Kroger tortilla chips come from Mission and are stocked by them as well
Diet Coke bandwagon for life!
Coca Cola just lost like 50% of their diet coke sales
The fact that harris teeter would have been Stevia, and it did so well. Just proves it's awesome.
I stand by matt's side though I dont even live in the US and I can't buy the Harris teeter thingy
It is verey easy...                 Water it good.
Hey Matt, cool if you notice this.  Our hometown just calls it "bottles"  Yeah, you heard that right.
soft drink all the way
This is like quitting a drug for mat
Wait he lives in the same state as me
Am i the only person that called the drinks by their names and not what they were?
Rate the worst too. I prefer Pepsi. My Fiance prefers Coke.

At this point you should make your own Diet Coke 😎
C:coke
Honestly like regular pepsi diet pepsi tastes better than diet coke
Not at Illinois going out to a 9 seed #DISAPPOINTMENT
I have no idea how people could be addicted to Diet Coke. It tastes like cola flavored seltzer. At least Coke Zero tastes a lot more like Coke Classic.
I’m always at pick n save when I come home from school. You’re telling me that I probably have bought it and didn’t even realize, wow!!
Missourian here we say sodapop, pop and soda. We are a Midwestern state, but southern in history. If you say coke we will think of the drug before the drink. (If out of context and used in a broad term)  Man I love Coke! Will give you looked at
Has anyone ever heard of the soda "Squirt"? Its a really good grapefruit soda and i highly recommend it.
DID THIS MAN JUST SAY HE DIDNT LIKE THE DIET COKE AS MUCH?! IMPOSTER! SUS CALL THE COPS! HE IS AN ALIEN!

Matpat invents this horrible inhumane torture with aspartam and calls it a fun contest. What a sick-sick man.
I forget that not everyone knows what Publix is
TIL MatPat lives in NC and not Cali
Hey, the latest videos were actually good!
I know I'm late to this but whatever, I don't know if it's an english thing or not but in my house growing up it's all called coke
8:30 they do, i personally love their cream sodas, but their diet soda probably wouldn't be too good.
Random, useless fun fact that I learned in this vid: food lion here in belgium is called delhaize. So for any of you who like food lion and come visit here, you know what name you need to look for
What do you call it , pop soda coke or other? British people: *nervous laughter*

Why do I only see the finale with the three different sodas one underdog two kings as the finale of the food wars tournament
I do be a. pop
I had to run to the store immediately after this, so I grabbed Big K diet.. It doesn't quiiite match your description, but then again my favorite is the Diet Dr. Pepper & Cream Soda version they just started making last year.
Am I the only one that has never drank Diet Coke
In South Africa we call ALL sodas DRINKS (or coldrinks)
I’m from the UK and I just call them fizzy drinks, however I do just call things that taste very similar the same thing like I call Pepsi coke
NO
I'm in Germany so I'm no ice at resturaunts :)
Too bad he isn't in Germany we have schwip schwap
Love this video! As a big fan of diet coke myself it's fascinating to see something like this... although very bummed diet pepsi didn't get far because that's my personal favourite :)
Scott we need mat pat to do more fanf theorys I got one for the booking noise on freddy on the poster
As a Coke ZERO person, i am glad my favourite got into top 3 :)
Have you tried Dr Pepper? Its like Coke, but healthier. Then there is Fizzy Vimto.... Delicious...
Isn't it objective... Taste... Wouldn't really call it a theory
RC cola
She called in matthew @0:93 and his face just dropped.
I just realized why do so many youtubers live in North Carolina
E
We have food lions everywhere in maryland, I always figured it was a massive corporation and I was shocked to find out that it's a small chain.
Coke
We sit in silence for king soopers
3:46 turn on captions
I only drink pepsi. I'm like the man in the pepsiman game
As someone that consumes almost all of her drinks with Stevia I have to say that there Is small margin between to little or to much when you used it. But, regardless, once you get use to Stevia, sugar becomes kinda overwhelming.
6:25 She super skinny
Agreed I like store popcorn
I’m not going to lie. Those two liter sparkling waters at hyvee slap
B
Hon I’m soda, even though I’m from the Midwest
I love Zevia! 😁
I have a smith's right by my house, maybe I'll pick up their diet cola.
Anyone else notice the audio is out of sync?
Try not to like this  comment. . . .
ikr lol
I Thought that mat pat would say "I quit diet coke I'm going back to coke"
Mesico coke is king
matts winner diet soda: failed succesfully
I say its pop i live in Ohio btw
we went from KFC theory's, to seeing matt drink types of diet drinks. seems legit
Soda pop
Perhaps it would be a good Food theory to explore Senku's Cola from doctor stone and compare it to different kinds of cola?
I live in South Carolina and go to food lion almost every day😂
Would you rather be a pepper too?
Florida was  Coke my family siad coke for soda
B: Soda
In my youth on the East Coast (South Boston) it's called Tonic by many.
B
Central illinois is a mish mash of all those names. We hear soda the most but also pop or Sodie ( my family says this one alot) or from a really old person sodie pop
What I will say is that if you're trying to replace Diet Coke for health reasons, you can't just drink any other diet cola. They all have similar ingredients. That is, of course not the case with Zevia. The reason why Zevia tasted weird is because of the fact that you're used to Diet Coke. Not only that, you were drinking the other colas right before drinking Zevia. Stevia in general takes time to get used to. I haven't had any soda other than Zevia since June of 2017 and I've gotten used to it. It's sweet once you drink another can. In addition to it not having sugar, artificial sweeteners, or colors, it also doesn't have any of those preservatives shown to cause cancer that can be found in most sodas.
Diet any soda 🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢 I’m usually open and understand people have different likes and dislikes. But I draw the line at diet soda. There is no understanding that. How? Why? Who? Nasty.
sodastream ;>
B:SODA
In Texas it's universally coke except for Dr pepper
It's fizzy here in Scotland
Why diet tho..... zero tastes way way better, it’s almost exactly the same as normal coke  Edit: glass bottle and can are the best lol.....
You poor thing
I have a soda stream
Yo we have food loin in Tennessee
The character ark payoff 12 years in the making
Matpat... you know you cant resist the sweet alluring scent of a nice, cool, crisp, brisk (idk if theyre the same), calories-less diet coke
im a soda man
Cola time
This video is proof that mat and steph share the same brain
New Mexico, everything is coke lol
Four minutes in, and I have to say you’re already contradicting yourself. The very beginning you stated that availability had to be a primary category. However you then choose fountain Diet Coke which is not primarily available in the home. Therefore unless you are comparing fountain Diet Coke‘s to other fountain diet cola’s... Yay nostalgia of the 1980s and the cola wars; taste tests between Pepsi and Coke, delightful. I love that you found a local store 2 litter; best price, good plastic recycling likelihood, independent businesses.
As someone who lives in NC, *y o u k n o w w h a t h a r r i s t e e t e r i s o r y o u a r e n t f r o m n c*
Hundreds of thousands of Southerners are about to swarm Harris Teeter for that cola.
i say soda but i live in SC so it’s also universally coke down here
mat, food lion isn’t that underground
I’m an “attack helicopter” kinda guy
Im from NC and i thought Foodlion was everywhere.
mat is in north carolina?!
DONT DO IT MATPAT COME BACK TO THE DIET COKE
Just drink water :o
It's soda pop is just weird
My mom used to buy stevia (and occasionally still does,) until she found out about the aftertaste that she, and everyone else in my family hates. Weirdly, I can't, for the life of me, taste the aftertaste of stevia, unless I eat it raw out of the pack.  My tongue still remembers, thinking about it.
im pop lmao
🥤🥤🥤🥤🥤🥤🥤🥤
As a diet coke-aholic, im offended
Any soda always tastes better from a fountain
yes diet dr pepper
soda
😱😱😱😱 No I quit using and liking the VIDEOS
I’m sorry you did what?
We have both Harris teeter and Foodlion on VA, I might have to give these a try 😋
Soda
yooo why does steph kinda look like the catch me outside girl
........................................... . . . . . . . . . .  Wow
North Carolina still has Food Lion? All of the ones I know in Georgia and Tennessee closed down. I assumed they all closed.
You should do a deep dive into the claim the aspartame is bad. Within the amounts that a person could consume in a day It is pretty safe to say that it's safe
I love in savannah georgia and I love food lion soda
No one else say fizzy juice?
Pop
I'm pop and soda
You should try coffee coca cola! My family and I found it on Florida and its delicious! I'm not old enough to have coffee but I got a few sips and amazing!
coke
I’m soft drink
Bruh I thought they lived in California 💀
How to pronounce it in the northern states (opinion) Soda is from a bottle (cause the lid screws) Pop is from a can (cause the lid pops)
:a
Pepsi max is best in my part of the UK
I wasnt aware you were a real person lol
i am shocked they recorded the whole video in front of the bright window
1. But you didn’t attempt to pallet cleanse between samples that would almost certainly bias your preference. Its clear to me why the citrus was a winner, a jumble of flavours your pallet screams for a difference something to notice. You may also consider how your diet affects your taste perception, as well as prolonged drinking of the stuff if you plan on drinking a lot of it.   2. But to be completely honest, this was an irresponsible promotion to binge drink unhealthy products, that you should be drinking in moderation instead.  Personal habits are best left off the screen, your YouTube effects a lot of young viewers that look up to you and listen to what you say, without questioning it. You also quickly shut down any opposite opinion, with a snappy repetition of what you had just said.  Please be responsible.
Where I come from we call it pop
Other
Dear god... MATPAT WITHOUT DIET COKE = END OF THE UNIVERS!  /j
When you disqualified Dr Pepper I unsubscribed I’m not joking I actually did
Food lion is in West Virginia too
You wear that red jacket more then Johnny Lawerence...
No Diet Coke
The Rock Paper Scissors game they had was the best way to show that those two were meant for each other.
I'm a Coke Zero guy.  I drink it solo and I drink it with both Spiced Rum and Canadian style whiskey.  Best part is that I can get it when I go to Europe for military stuff.  (I used to drink whiskey with Diet Mountain Dew but couldn't get the Dew in Europe)
Soda
Pop
i live in NC and go to both of these stores alot so i will have to try them. i never really paid attention to them because they just they looked kinda crappy.
Thank god. I am glad he ditched the trash that is Diet Coke.
Only true OG’s remember MatPat obsession with Diet Coke
I say soda
I live in Texas and I’ve never heard it called anything other than “soda”
MatPat: I quit diet coke The Coca Cola company: THAT"S JUST A THEORY!!! A FOOD THEORY!!! Buy our stuff please.
Boylan makes very good soda mabye that ones no good
Taste Test competition should have been completely "blind" with the reveal at the end. Then you could have voiced over your impressions after finding out which brands you were drinking in each round. IMO
We need to get these two to do a whiskey episode.
Matpat instead of a duet soda, try a normal one because it is more healthy.
Me someone who works on LBI New Jersey and has loved Boylan Soda for years: Ok 😀
Canadians hearing "pop" and later remembering that its  an American channel: 😌...😳..😄
Definitely one of my favorite Food Theory videos. I love these GMM style food tournaments.
Breaking news:Coca Cola Corporation stocks go down 10%,due to lack of sales.
Coke Zero all the way
Oh my goodness MatPat quit diet coke🤯. Way to go Matt
A
in NY: Coke, Soda or Soda Pop Though Coke is just mainly synonymous with the brand, if you want a coke then you mean you want coca-cola despite the brand.  As for the private label part, yes. It is true. I work for a pharmaceutical manufacturing company and we do change the tubes/casing yet have the same product for those different companies.  Sometimes it gets a changed base on the potency of the medication but it wouldn't be surprising if 20 other brands share the same identical products. Especially smaller local brands love doing this.
Pop all the way!
MatPat: “no Rootbeer or DrPepper” My Mom: ......       *And I took that personally*
I think Diet Coke (or Coke Light, how its called in Germany) is one of the worst tasting sugerfree Cola there is. I don't know if the recipes differ so much from Germany to the US, but it has a weird metalic aftertaste which is unpleasant. I didn't had this problem with any other sugerfree Cola, not even cheap Aldi or Lidl Cola. Also Czech Kofola Cola is terrible too; it tastes for whatever reason like medicine.
My favorite is Diet Pepsi! :)
Oh matpat quit diet coke must be close to the end of the universe
if diet cheerwine has zero calories ya missed it
... my name is matthew and right now watching im drinking... diet coke am i him?
my brother drinks 2 bottles of diet cola a day
Cannot understand anyone liking diet beverages of any sort.  The aftertaste of fake sugar in any form is something that makes me want to download a few gallons of water to wash my mouth out.
We call it cola
My dad works for Pepsi so I wanted Pepsi to win
As a person who was born and raised in North Carolina, I appreciate this video
Please add thums up cola next time. It is big in india
Florida is not a Southern state it's a state in the south.
Hey I live in North Carolina, that's cool
b
I'm from Great Britain, so who even says pop or soda?
Sodawater, aka "sodavand" in denmark
OMG they have Mega Image, only its called Food Lion
OM om om om godly what
Too bad they don't sell diet blue Fanta. Thing tastes like it has enough sugar to keep a kid up for 3 days straight. But I love it so much
out of the coca cola and pepsi flavours in my opinion pepsi max is the best one, we dont have diet pepsi here in sweden at least not around me and coca cola zero is far better than diet coca cola (here its called coca cola light idk if its the same thing and since they're not made anywhere near eachother i assume its different)  zero has a better stable flavour while diet have a bit of the taste cola foam has if you drink before it goes away.. max is sweeter than zero but also more flavourful
Coca-Cola Stock Price (KO) March 17, 2021: $51.24 March 18, 2021: $50.57 ⬇️  Thanks MatPat... I lost a fortune.
I’ve had a soda stream root beer and it was good but I don’t know bout that cola...
Shasta is so nasty lol
Bruh, where can you even get Coke life anymore, that stuff was incredible and I thought it was discontinued or something
Good thing I’m never drinking coke or pepsi ever
I personally like hydrogen and a bit of oxygen in a liquid form as my drink
Drink water haiiyyaaa
B
Feels like we're headed towards a Food Theory episode dedicated to citric acid
Soda. That's what I've always known it as.
In the UK we just say fizzy drink
Don't drink diet soda, it's way worse for you than regular soda is.
20:54 feels like there was a top ten anime betrayals moment
i like the concept... my only problem with the this is that you don't have something to clean your pallet.(you sip directly to the next soda cup without cleaning the pallet) it may have an effect on the taste. other than that great vid...  Edited: i wrote this originally at the mid of the video. You mentioned that in the vid that coke zero didn't register as sweet as you used to may be affected because of what you drank previously.
My favorite drink is Cheerwine.
YES YES HE DID IT
When I started this video I had a bottle of coke cola cherry zero sugar
You forgot diet coke from a glas bottle
other "läsk" pop in swedish
im from the south long time theorist but I say both soda and coke also is the peanuts in coke weird or what? (btw if this becomes a future food theory you could totally throw this comment in the video)
You need to try Afri-Cola
How bad of a sugar rush were you on that day? XD
Fizzy drink
this may be true, but is it as good as the legendary McDonald's sprite
In this episode of getting rid off my strange addiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUMhUg1kxBU
It’s just a theory a game theory er- i mean food theory I mean
"Soft drink" gang represent
Me: *Sprinkles citric acid on top of pork roast*
diet coke
I never drink coke
next theory : i quit food
To complete the bars, make a channel called “music theory”
Fun fact: A Diet Coke made in America contains the same amount of sugar as a full sugar coke made in the UK
We call it Fizz/Fizzy here in NZ
Waiiiitt you guys are having coke?
i remember food lion, it was right around the corner.
Matt: "The North Carolina based supermarket, Food Lion, which you've probably never heard of-" Me: "Food Lion? From SuperMega?"
I work at Fry's
I lean to Pepsi and I prefer Pepsi zero sugar
I give up "Woke-Coke" for propel water. I drink right after I get up because it wakes me up right, not like "Woke-Coke". And I drink it all day long and sometimes I drink it in the night too. It is better for me. I love peach propel.
me: i heard my name in this video                             what? sam : rando me: no! diet idiot, what a weirdo
Soda all the way. From central cali, pop sounds old school, and why would you ever call all soda coke?
Me when I saw this : EXCUSE ME-????????
64 teams? No. A stack of teams? Yes.
I was born in Ohio and I saw Soda.
I only like Diet Coke from the can.
down in Australia we call it fizzy drink
I switched from Diet Coke to Diet Dr. Pepper.
Plot twist: that Harris teeter soda was just a mishap and that bottle was a mistake
My favorite cola is the fountain from ikea
Out of the list in the beginning of the video the only one I knew was his Diet Coke obsession and also I started watching him today
Pop I'm iowan
Hey Diet soda contains Aspertain witch causes cancer so maybe you should quit diet and move to maybe a lighter soda instead of dark soda just saying that diluting on the diet is more like filtering on your body....
omgs dude drink seltzer water it's cheaper and less damaging, or drink low carb Monster (no affiliation) it contains B vitamins and amino acid!
I live in Georgia. 2 things 1, we dont call everything coke, 2 we have food lion.
I-if MattPatt gave up diet coke for all of 2020, how did he do Round 7 of the HotOnes Challenge video (Film Theory: How to survive spicy food) 6 months ago where we see him drink a diet coke... For SCIENCE
Fun now I know I live in a state with good diet diet Coca-Cola
for the longest time as a kid i called soda fizzlies because i didnt know the actual name
Diet Coke Bad Normal Coke Good I dont like the taste
Have you heard of song theary
Fizz
coke or soda, East texas was almost exclusively coke but ive lived on the east coast so ive got a bit of "yankee" in my speech apparently :/
Glass coke has the best taste easy
I had no idea how isolated food lion was I’ve always grown up with it and though it was big store
15:32- B
We call it soft drink or fizzy drink.
I just call it coke because I realized that Coca-Cola is LITERALLY COKE. Like cocaine coke.
Rock paper scissors! **both chooses Rock** **4 rounds of choosing Rock later** **both choose paper** Both: *YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!
down here in nz we call it fizi
Me to!
15:28 I'm a D
Food lion has the base sweat and sour mix too.  Sage advice.
im not gonna watch someone get diabeeties
i sugest you should try ginger ale, its good
a
i got way too deep into this for someone who cant stomach diet soda in genral
Sprite is better
We have Frys and Food 4 Less. I should buy a 2 liter and send it to MatPat to see if its the same.
Diet Coke has lime citric acid, Diet Pepsi has lemon citric acid... main difference beyond the sweetener.
b
tfw you're a North Carolinian and there's at least two Food Lions and Harris Teeters just a stone's throw away from your house. Have I been wrongfully snubbing my store brands all these years? Eh, doesn't matter. Cheerwine is still the best soda NC has to offer.
We call it pop here cause in the wintertime it goes boom
Me: B. Soda. My fiancé: D. Soft Drink. (With an explanation)
Sprite Sprite Sprite
Stevia taste is really specific. You either tolerate it or hate it
Diet sprite?
Coke sucks lmao
“Probably never heard of.” Food Lion is like the Smiths of the east coast
I actually call it tonic
Triangle test: three opaque cups. One filled different to the other two. Which is different. If you can tell the difference a statistically significant number of times, then which do you prefer.
Kinda random, but anyone else surprised that MatPat said Florida is part of the South?
fautian diet coke?
Kroger Big K Root Beer is the best for the price.
Matt are u in Charlotte?
Me who lives in North Carolina and loves Harris Teeter: :))))))))
d fizzy drink
läsk
In the UK we call it pop sooo
Built dofferent
20:42 My face when he said number 2
There is only one soda that is available in North Carolina and not represented on this channel. That is Sams Club that is at Wal-Mart.
Citric acid is like the fnaf of food theory. In the sense that it is fairly prominent
C coke
I’m from south and she is 100% right we do refer to all soft drinks as coke  Rory for edit I accidentally said cole
Diet Coke contained cocaine
I say “soda” or “soft drink” or “fizzy drink”
I live on zevias I have like 1 a day
You should try virgils
Diet coke is water with coke
I.m not soda not pop but i.m frisdrank
fizzy drink, soft drink and soda (some times)
LET'S GO HARRIS TEETER
Matpat is Mr.D from Percy jackson
20:47 Steph's face while MatPat explains himself is priceless. 😂
Me over here who hate Coke and OG Cola taste in general: 👁👄👁
Put a slice of lemon in your coke people, it’s amazing.
WOW KEEP IT UP WITH KOOL AID GUY
Me who lives in Europe: :c
They easily differentiate between can, bottle and fountain of the same soda, meanwhile you can hear people saying Coke and Pepsi taste the same.
I call it pop
Is it hard to believe I’m a Soda AND Pop man?
NUMBER 12
im coke but we see soda where i live to
ive had soda stream, its good
So, I drink a 2 liter bottle of diet soda every day, by far, my poison of choice is Walmart's Sam's Diet Cola.  I think it tastes better than Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi and every other store brand.Hands down.
I looked at the ingredients of diet coke. It said "sugar: 0, Sodium: 14 or something" so technically diet coke is salty. Not healthy
I watch this one video and now youtube is giving me a bunch of coke ads, why did you do this to me matpat
tbh i felt so sad when he said no rootbeer, im lowkey addicted
i used to always think publix was a florida thing until a georgian told me about it. what other southeast states have publix?
NOOOOOOOOO
Every time I get into a video I feel like I'm going into an action movie
It’s finger licking good
Gotta love those faces at 9:37
best theory. gonna have t otry kroger now LOL
I wonder what top left of the logo will be
Mat pat approved diet sodas Coca Cola doesn’t want you to know about! Number 6 will surprise you
me being british i call it pop 15:29
About to go to my local SC Harris Teeter and grab me some diet cola.
Coke Zero > Diet Coke
I love how Matt says you haven’t heard of some of the stores ha jokes on your I live in North Carolina ^^
I like soda stream
I teeter on Cola and Soda as the term, I was originally from NorCal
North Carolina grocery store colas are pretty pog
I actually really like Cola Oh!, which I believe is Smith's store brand Diet Cola/Coke Zero here in the West.
I'm all about the Kroger Branded Cola Oh!  Sadly it's not available at all Krogers.
I’m soda
b
we called it “soda pop” in the oregon area lol
18:58 You two really are soul-mates
You call it soda or you don’t deserve to drink it.
Pop in good old iowa
Coke is better for you than diet coke
Coke I am from the south
In the north east it's tonic.
If food lions cola is better then Pepsi then I’ll have to try it. Btw we have them in a state which isn’t North Carolina
here in NZ we call it fizzy xD
Our czech national drink Kofola is best cola drink in world.... Im sorry but its true. And also I am sorry for anybody who is not from europe to taste it
Coke Zero is now called Coke No Sugar here in Oz. I prefer the original name. Here in Qld Australia we call it Soft Drinks down south they used to call it Cordial (not sure if it's still a thing) whilst Cordial here is the non fizzy syrup you mix with water.
I'm glad Coke Zero made it so far. Coke Zero is REALLY good.
This is my first Food Theory video, for some reason (it's taken a long time) but it's really good. Glad you added that yellow segment to your theorist ring!
Wait a second, if you're so focused on choosing a soda that you can drink in your day-to-day life, so you won't choose an out-of-state cola, why would you even allow Fountain Diet Coke to be an option?! What, do you have a soda fountain at your house? Then again....... you probably do.
12:21
Here we call every soda "bebsi"
I am part of the pop gang
Actually, Food Lion is very popular thru Romania under the name of Mega Image, the more you know
WAH NAAAA (edit: when did insay this)
I am both B and C
I like root beer and so agree with the sources part 🤣
Tbh Diet Coke tastes like Tylenol
If you you scroll down enough so that the circle of the food theory logo is just gone, it looks matt is bald
I am a self proclaimed Original Coca-cola officionado, i can tell coke apart by its source and country As i travel and drink coke everywhere i go finnish, russian and thai coke all taste different
Super diet Coke
Woo we hit it home NC pride!
C that’s my answer
Pepsi zero sugar is called Pepsi Max in the UK
Pepsi Zero is my Harris Teeter  Edit: I would have picked Pepsi zero, I left the coke group because I found out that they used to use cocaine, and they still kept the name that they got for using it
No RC cola?
My current fave is Pepsi Max from a plastic bottle (UK), but I'm aware that the same product tastes different in every country. Coca Cola Light (EU) tastes better than Diet Coke (UK).
Crap, I'm in Maine everything's owned by Delhaize/Food Lion not Kroger
I'm napój gazowany, because in My native language napój gazowany means pop soda.
12:09 Matpat better be talkin' 'bout drugs
I have lived in Alabama for my whole life and I just want to say that from my experience, we don’t call all soda ‘Coke’. We just say ‘soda’ or ‘soft drinks’.
Diet Dr.pepper.
I did this with Dr Pepper by myself over early quarantine. Not 16 but probably 8. It was fun and a good way to pass the time. Btw it’s Soda Pop. Grew up in Minnesota. Most people in my life call it pop though.
zevia cream soda is the best, fight me
I'm in NC mattpat
I just tried Boylan root beer and it’s really good!
The ultimate underdog story
As a Harris Teeter employee, this is the biggest Flex of my Life
first is the worst second is the best third is the one with a hairy chest.
Hierarchy of diet Coke: Glass bottles Fountain Plastic bottles Can Fast food chain fountain

Sadly I live in grermany
Your childhood is not real if U haven't tried la-cola
Your love for Diet Coke amuses me
Diet coke 🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣
At the start of the video: Which diet soda is the healthiest? Later: Which diet soda is my favorite, not caring about the healthiness!
Based upon thar loglng list of prerequences, it didn't seem as though he was attempting to change.
The entertaining scorpio meteorologically stain because math certainly expand excluding a redundant roof. courageous, daily knowledge
I think in the Philippines we say soft drinks but not very sure.
We have Food Lion in South Carolina
I'm Soda in levetown also big fan.
Coke Had Their Chance, Matthew Patthew Has Moved On.
The steady crop finally notice because iran unquestionably reign at a innocent pyjama. judicious, deranged memory
Wow, most people I know don't even register the difference between diet and non-diet coke. I thought I was alone in coke-snobbery :D
*reads title* Oh good for you MatPat  *watches video* Oh noooooooooo....
New Orleans calls it cold drink
Me who's a water kind of man

I lived in cali’s bay and it’s always been soda for me 💀😂 even in Spanish
worst things in 2020 3. Forest fires 2. Covid-19 1. Mat Pat not having his Diet Coke
Title: "I QUIT diet coke!"  topic of video: is literally drinking kilogrammes of diet coke
Other I am from Australia
Here in India, all carbonated drinks are called cold drinks lol. Unless it is unflavoured sparkling water, then we call it soda
Here in Missouri we call it cola
Food Lion for the win!
Yo can you send me a bottle -a fellow Diet Coke addict
I present to you: water. Better than any soda.
Crystal pepsi came back for a while, I loved it
Matpat you need to try Diet Faygo soda
In Canada their is a brand just called no name

Finally confirming that that they moved to NC.  Means that I might have a chance to meet the guy, someday.  Also, HT and Food Lion do be poppin'.
Coke
i never drink coke   e
Diet coke,more like coke with the word diet
Are you a unc fan like me
Growing up my favorite pop was diet pepsi. It didn't change until pepsi one with Splenda came out or diet pepsi wild cherry but then it became diet pepsi again after pepsi one went away and I got used to the taste again.  Then I got used to diet pepsi without aspertame where most hated it for being sweeter but when it went away I eventually liked diet pepsi again as my all time favorite though at first it was gross because I was used to a sweeter version.  Also love diet mountain dew.  Wouldnt diet Dr pepper being a dark cola count for this list?  Caffeine free diet pepsi and caffeine diet mountain dew to me though we're so gross. Almost as gross as Tab.
A
Why do fountain drinks taste more sweeter or different then the bottle drinks?
You need diet cheer wine it is the best soda
I am in Australia so we call it soft drink
NOOOOOOOOOOO!
There's a Diet drink I want you to try in  Australia called Diet Bundaberg. But you can get it on Amizon!
This is not very cash money of you
honestly its good diet dr.pepper wasnt here it goes flat so f-ing fast
As a cashier for Food Lion, our diet sodas are pretty good all things considered. Our grape soda is straight bangin though
Okay, but why not drink regular coke, which is arguably less bad for you.
Easy crack
Surprisingly citric acid is the big difference between Coca Cola and Pepsi which why Pepsi most likely won all of those taste contests back in the 80s I believe it was.
This makes me very happy because we North Carolinians don't get a lot of respect.
Its truly the end of the world if Manhattan is giving up on Diet Coke
I am b

This is the comeback RC Cola has been waiting for.

Fun fact: I hate Diet Coke here in Denmark, but I can’t get enough of it when I’m in the states.  It just tastes better there, even tho one would think that a company like Coca Cola would make it taste the same world wide.
The passion here is too much man (0o0)

No hate but I got Diet Coke by accident at a restaurant and it was DISGUSTING
I think I'll stick with dr. pepper for now
Soda, but I think pop sounds more cute
When I first saw the title I thought that this was clickbait because I never thought Mat would ever quit Diet Coke

Press F to pay respect to Diet Coke
D.other       Is soft drinks
Kroger uses cola oh I think
So because you and Steph had different opinions on the last one for two of them and had an agreement that Diet Coke was 2nd place, it averages out to a tie
Im like Diet coke
They should make a drink theory

"Food Lion" is very popular in my part of the EU. It's called Delhaize tho

Lol I’m an A
While I appreciate your willingness to try to be impartial on which flavor you prefer, you did give Diet Coke a leg up in the competition off the bat. The Diet Coke qualification round ensured that between bottles, cans, and fountain, the best (in your opinion as the judge) version of Diet Coke would go up against seemingly random versions of the other sodas. Some of them only come in one version (Boylan, for example) but for many of them also have can and bottle versions and the Pepsi products certainly have fountain versions.  I'm a little bummed for you that you couldn't find the Diet Coke w/Splenda version, it's my favorite Diet Coke. I usually pick it up in Target in 12-packs of cans. You may want to glance down the soda aisle next time you're in Target and give it a try.  (Note, drinking HT Zero Calorie Cola as a I write this...)
That rock paper scissors trial made me laugh a good bit dude!! XD
Mr Beast is from North Carolina, you know?

You need to try Mexican Coca-Cola (Coke made in Mexico). It is usually sold in a glass bottle and they still make it with natural sugar cane.
FINALLY!!! THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
There are three food lions near me in NC.
I am 100% Texan and I have never heard a single man say "What kind of coke you want."
i live in the midwest but i say soda
Over here in australia we call them soft drinks or fizzy drinks
Pineapple Fanta is the MOST underrated soda hands down
nice video!
As someone who if I want something sweet I basically have to have stevia (not diabetic, but have mild fructose intolerance, and my doctor told me not to have aspartame, sucralose or other artificial sweeteners) I understand how the Zevia could be too sweet, stevia is way sweeter than other sugars, I'm not sure the actual ratio but it is something like spoonfuls to cups.
And Jon tron is alive
Because I live near there
What have you done with the real Matt Pat
omg i love zevia
food Theorists just doesn't bite down as well as game Theorists. he he a joke
I grew up in a border city right across California's USA-Mexico Border called Mexicali which is locally famous for its vast CocaCola bottling plant. So, as years went by and after working in the bottling plant itself, I can tell you a few oddities: 1) Consumers, myself included, absolutely LOVE freshly-made Coca Cola, the original, non-diet flavor that is. 2) The container is quite important due to carbon dioxide's diffusivity coefficient through glass, aluminium and plastic (from lowest to highest) - glass preserving that "freshly-made taste" consumers love. 3) And most curious one, Mexican and American flavors of Diet CocaCola and regular CocaCola are switched. I.E. Mexican reg. CocaCola taste just like American Diet CocaCola and viceversa. Don't ask me why. As a former chemist for the QA department, my job was FAR from knowing what the beverageers worked with. Due to most of this, reg. glass-bottled CocaCola is the norm with our southern neighbor. I drink to to now having access to that 11/10 flavor of fresh CocaCola, straight out of the reactor chamber that mixes the reagents into CocaCola.
B: Soda
Real NC gangstas no food lion and Harris teeter
Here in Australia we say soft drink and if it has the word Coke on it its coke, No one says Pop or soda here

He stopped drinking diet coke in 2020 because diet coke broke up with him.

Fun fact: New Coke is just Coke with twice the concentrate while Coke Zero is just New Coke but diet
I personally prefer Coke Zero (especially with the Cherry flavor)
Yall should have tried coke life just for fun. It's actually good. Also caffeine free diet coke/Pepsi weirdly taste like the normal version.
Me: That’s just a ThEoRy a FIL...   Mat: a FOOD THEORY

this could have been a good april fools joke
Actually some people are gonna absolutely hate me but.. I don’t like Diet Coke I don’t know why, it’s just regular coke somehow tastes better, perhaps it’s because some of the Diet Coke I have is the Sams cola and with me strongly disliking it, it just got rid of how I tasted Diet Coke         You may hate me now
soda
I just bought Kroger brand Big K Diet Cola. It does have the citric acid on the ingredients list and I agree with you about the taste it has and the slightly fruity after taste so I’d assume it’s the same pop as Harris Teeter has!
I'm a soda person, lol. NJ.
A pop
That...yeah, kroger is usually really good stuff
im with steph, it’s all ‘coke’ or ‘ soft drink’ im from NC too
Yes I am chaotic neutral
food lion and harris teeter are so ingrained into my life i almost forget theyre NC based. NC reppppp
Kroger has this habit of making quietly-produced yet wonderful foodstuffs, weirdly.
Diet coke? Absolutely barbaric. *sips regular coke*
march -mad- ness
I love how at the beginning he treat this like a normal theory he has the criteria and all the stuff and it’s really funny
I don't get the soda/pop divide. I grew up in the suburbs of NYC and always heard/said Soda. I went to school up near Buffalo, NY and they were all saying Pop. Even in the same state we can't agree.
Hands down soda
I have had coke said to me but also soda
I love that at the creation of this comment there is almost the exact same amount of views as there is subscribers (2.4mil).

You: Food Lion is in North Carolina.  Me: I live in Georgia, and I have a Food Lion about 10 minutes away.
In Canada it is called “Bibble bubble sweet drank”

How much is your jackt tho for real

What kinda coke you want sprite a sentence i've heard many times here in the south
Whoever is in charge of watching the sales analytics for Harris Teeter brand soda is gonna have a very confusing day at work when they fly off the shelf like Gamestop stock
Once you taste Mexico’s coca cola you wont like USA’s they use cane sugar over here and its awesome
Bacon soda PLEASE!
Hey baby girl (pins you down) I have been thinking about you

If you put in scitrick acid strick acid i wold of won
I live in North Carolina, I gotta try that Harris Teeter cola
The thing about it is, Harris Teeter is waaaaay more expensive than food lion. Disappointed not gonna lie. Coke Zero is much better IMO, but then again I haven’t had every diet soda lol
I’m “B.” Soda is by the best, but pop is ok. I live in Texas now, and I personally HATE people calling it coke.😂 Coke is a brand, not all sodas. Also, many probably do know Food Lion from Mr. Beast videos.
As someone who lived near a Kroger in college, their diet cola/pop products are actually really good and much better than Diet Coke (I actually don't like Diet Coke at all, but do like Coke Zero). Kroger's Diet Pepper knock-off is also much better than actual Diet Dr. Pepper.
I'm a lifelong Michigander, it's pop
Why diet soda though? It’s not actually better for you. Just bad in different ways. And doesn’t taste nearly as good. And Coca Cola Life is WAY better for you than many of these, except for the full cane sugar or stevia sodas. Zevia, the healthiest of them all, I actually like, but Cola is not the best flavor of Zevia though. Also, Mexican, glass bottle Coke is clearly the best soda out there.
Why diet soda though? It’s not actually better for you. Just bad in different ways. And doesn’t taste nearly as good.
can confirm:  grew up in Huntsville, Alabama ... when ordering a soda/pop, we would ask for a "coke" and then be asked what flavor and I would then have to say "coca-cola pls"
I’ve vacationed in North Carolina from the Outer Banks with my family (currently there), and the Food Lion is the Grocery Store of choice we choose. Never had the soda, but Food Lion is something that my family greatly appreciates. I rooted for Food Lion and am now wanting to try the Harris Teeter.
bruh you missing out on diet dr pepper :/
he pees coke
PEPSI MAAAAAN! SorryI really wanted to say that I have been waiting for en eternity to say that with context
oh the best Fizzy Drink that is healthy is water. (jk)

NC girl...and it’s all Coke. And I love my Pepsi Zero so let’s see if you can change my mind 😏
Darn it. Now I have to go buy Harris Teeter
At this point Matt should be a drink or food critic.
In Australia we call it Soft drink.  hence the joke "at least it's soft drink" that someone inevitably makes if you're hit by a can.
This was fun,I hope Mat and Septh are ok after drinking all that coke.
The clumsy tennis biomechanically bubble because error desirably use next a fallacious measure. aspiring, ambitious lock
I’d call it soft drink
1:12 Wait, mattpatt stopped Diet Coke for *all of 2020*? That makes the "Hot Ones" video a lot more sad in hindsight, I guess...
Fizzy drink in tasmania.
I’m B. Call it Soda mostly. But sometimes I’ll call it Cola. Lol
I call it soda and pop whichever i say is what i say lol and my friends pick one or the other and stick with it.
I just don't drunk soda period.
I say soda, but as a Texan I know folks who call SWEET TEA coke.

In Texas we call it coke and soda

6:24 , i find it.... weird. then it immediately pauses and cuts at 6:27
Ha I drink WAY MORE Dr.pepper
So isn't Steph like Cuban? So, Cubans are now southern folk? Also, what a biased experiment. No mouth swish. Stevia as a sweetener? Really, also diet cola? F outta here.
Coke Zero cherry the best soda 👀 you can only find it in the south US tho :(
The rock paper scissor match reminded me of the ginyu force hahaha
Diet Coke is based off of New Coke from the 80s.  While people screamed for the "classic" recipe to come back, Diet New Coke instantly became the #1 diet soft drink.  When they switched back to Classic Coke, they kept the New Coke for their diet soda only.  That is why the style of the logo is always been different.  Coke Zero is diet Classic Coke.  I actually like New Coke a little better when it came out, but I was more into things like Mountain Dew and Squirt at the time.  When I started a diet in the early 90s I got hooked on Diet Coke and can not stand Classic Coke any more.  The problem I have with many of the off brand colas is they are based on Pepsi and I hate that too.  Few budget colas took after Diet "New" Coke.  Now I typically prefer Diet Coke from the plastic bottle, but that is because cans are too expensive and fountain drinks are too inconsistent.  The flavor is based on the calibration and cleanliness of the machine.  As for the cola you picked... you could have just look to see if Kroger subsidiaries carry a generic diet soda with citric acid in it.  And with about 5 seconds of looking I found Kroger's Big K Diet Cola...  "Ingredients Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Phosphoric Acid, Aspartame*, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Citric Acid, Caffeine, Natural Flavor"  So it is likely to be the same cola you drank.  I question if I would like it more.  Even though I like fruity soft drinks and such and Diet Cherry Coke... and Diet Dr. Pepper are OK, I hate Lime Coke and pretty much all other fruity colas.  I do not have any Kroger based stores near me and while the name and originator is similar, Fred Meyer and Fredrick Meijer, I am very partial to Meijer and they have their own brand and I think, like Kroger they manufacture quite a lot of their products.  They are the largest privately owned chain.  I do not care for their diet cola one bit.
Orange crush (sorry idk if it has calories)
Pop
Soda
22:28 kinda like how Best Choice Magic Marshmallows is literally just Marshmallow Mateys in a box
Australians just say Softdrink across the whole country. Generally, Soda here is Soda water, Water only flavoured by the carbonation.

I would love an episode checking on how unhealthy diet sodas are compared to the normal ones. I'm sure a lot of people would be surprised by what sweeteners do with your body.
The video sans is ness litterally pop up to more videos part.
I choose D.      *Extremely unhealthy bubbly artificial liquid that is too addictive for anyone’s wellbeing*
Soda
tecnaly diet soda if worse for you than just ordinary soda
I’ve drank the cough syrup cola before, and if you smell when drinking it, it sucks, but when it is in the bottle, it tastes amazing since you can’t smell it, basically the smell ruins the flavor of it, and thus you really gotta drink it from the bottle.
Pop
Is there no faygo over there?
20:40 MatPat is describing Harris Teeter Cola like Marshall describes his favorite burger.  God I feel old.
One soda you missed was rc cola
Soda I'm canadian
Diet Coke will poison you? wait does it? I’m confused Idk
I hate diet drinks, and I actually don't mind the soda stream diet cola.  Probably because it's closer to the flavor of a full cola.
In eastern kentucky we all call it pop
im cola
There are those who don’t, and those who do.  Dew The Dew
I like that Matt laughs every time he has something disgusting

Not a direct taste replacement but in my opinion coke zero is unbeaten.
Food lion is also in georgia
I am not a diet coke fan but regular coke i fk love it if i saw it in a can i will be drulding i think i love the gass more i love burbing yes i am weird
I’ve had the Whole Foods root beer it was clear and tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup
Pop
I have root beer flavored popsicles and my sister likes opening the package by poping the package, while she tries to do it i say "pop the pop popsicle!"
*The Plot Thickens*
Most of the people I know say pop (might be the fact I’m in England)
im a D. where i live its "carbonated" just "carbonated"
anyone remember coke life it was stevia instead of sugar and it was AWESOME. I feel like they would have liked that one. It got discontinued though. Introduced in 2013, then discontinued in europe and canada in 2019, then discontinued everywhere else in 2020
Personally i enjoy ginger beer
Kofola is the best!
This is gonna go down in history.
Coa cola diet coke is more healthy Also coa cola proceeds to change sticker of another normal cola can
THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD AND I FEEL YOU! I HAVE THE SAME ADDICTION BUT DIET PEPSI !
I'm an orange soda kind of guy.
NC has good food and  Harris Teeter is one of the better places to shop.
Food Lion was my ONLY grocery store growing up 😆 Harris Teeter was for the rich folks haha!
What happened here?
im from NC too 910 919 ftw
Matt and his straw looking like he snorting coke
In Australia we call then "soft drink"
Wait, coke zero and diet coke are different? Why...
I did a test like this 1 year ago. and Kroger sells a type of soda that tastes eerily like harris tater and that is "Cola OH!" it is so good i very nearly got an ulcer from drinking so much ata atime
3:00 shame. Cherry Pepsi is the best.

As a lifelong Diet Coke addict, this is all really entertaining and interesting and stuff. But... when do we get the real deal. You know, the video on aspartame?
At 23:00 what if u live in somewhere else then American
Why does he sound like film theory??
southeast U.S. and florida. she was right
Mat is so addicted to Diet Coke  And im equally addicted to coffee me and my friend litterally buyed any coffee we see in a store
Diet Coke is bad for you
When the wild card wins the championship:
The feeble feigned lobster distinctively wash because octagon undeniably fasten through a open lentil. graceful, worried cafe
I am a UK child so it is called a fizzy drink

Pop is much faster to say then Soda
What if citric acid is the missing ingredient for crabby patty
Our is soft drink
in australia its soft drink
I grew up as pop, now I alternate between pop and soda
I am d
honestly my allegiance is to coke zero
Yes some food plants do make different labels for the same product for different customers. Like the egg cartons lucerne and Walmart 😉

The friendly scissors inversely trot because nickel fascinatingly thaw over a reflective james. eminent, waggish peer-to-peer
Why diet coke? Does he not like regular coke? Just curious
It mightve just been me but steph looked a bit pale in the previous video, im glad she seems to be a bit better now!
Where I live we call it soft drink
here in australia we are 'fizzy drink'
In the northwest we call it soda
Food lion actually belongs to the Belgian group Delhaize... just wanted to say that for no reason
I'm from North Carolina. Soda is indeed called coke.
Pepsi Max is my favourite <3 coke zero is weird to me. Between Pepsi and coke I prefer the Pepsi sugar free sodas, but the coke ones are weird and gross imo
Soda by miles
OK, you are slacking Mat. Your throwing a fountain drink up against cans and bottles. That's not a fair fight. To continue the March Madness analogy, your throwing a Division I team into the Division II bracket. Talk about an uncontrolled variable ;)
No Diet Dr Pepper? Not a good tourney. I have been in most southern states (including NC) and Diet Dr. Pepper was totally available, especially in the Publix stores. I think you were afraid it would unseat your favorites.
I'm the one that always say Coke
i say coke lmao
As a proud texan I've never heard anyone say coke when talking about pop as a whole
You don’t need to like the home made one but did you make it right? It tasted like that when you don’t fallow the instructions right or it is old Becuse I had old one and it not good
They should have made it where they didn't know what two drinks they were tasting. also put the drink in a opaque cup so they couldn't see the color.
1:08 MatPat looks drunk and hungover
👍 great thanks
Whole Foods 365 brand is repack products, as in 365 doesn't make anything of it's own. You get someone's soda with the 365 name on it, it may have even been reformulated zevia.

"Drink. Some. Water."- Fallout 4
Yeah, and why are you quitting Diet Coke in the first place?
I am a Diet Coke fiend. I refuse to quit. And fountain is always the best.
I LOVE ZEVIA but I respect your opinion
No calories, really? :D Here in Central Europe we joke that our regular CocaCola is what is sold in USA as Diet Coke :D But man, you americans sure do stuff sugar into EVERYTHING!
Should try the Kroger Brand diet coke, i used to like Diet Coke, until i ran into this stuff.... the carbonation lasts longer
22:21 you basically talked about the same thing in the mr beast burger video
Soda
As someone who lived in New Mexico for a while, I can confirm that some people call all sodas coke.
Rootbeer with cane sugar is the best soda
i just say coke on instinced
22:47 that explains the glow up.
Why wasn't normal Diet Pepsi on here?
I’ve heard that Diet Coke sales have gone down lately.
As a North Carolinian I'm shocked anything Food Lion brand beat a name brand.
i can confirm as a person from the south it is like a tumble weed stuck on fire
Im soda
Yay Harris Teeter! Best soda and big chocolate chip cookies :D
i thought it said cocaine
Hey guys I’m delta ness lamo
Coke
I KNEW KROGER STOREBRAND WAS WEIRDLY GOOD! yknow what other one is weirdly good? Faygo Cola. Dont know why, but its in various dollar stores and passes the vibe check
In my area the only diet coke that i can buy is the normal one
pop
It's crazy to me how close I live to MatPat. My friend works at food lion and I work at Kroger, the company that owns Harris teeter, and usually shop at Harris teeter
CRAP! IM ALLERGIC TO CITRUS ACIDS
Comment challenge: describe Steph and Matt in 5 words or less
It’s called Soda or Coke, Pop is just wrong
I'm allergic to cola
Food Lion is in West Virginia as well
About what we call carbonated drinks... I'm from the U.K. (Manchester in England specifically) and I can't talk for the rest of England and the U.k. and we call all carbonated drinks "Fizzy drinks" and coca cola "coke" and Pepsi well... pepsi. Like sprite and Schweppes we just call that lemonade and we just use the names of fanta, lucosade, tango etc and just say the flavor. Hope this helps! 🙃
Down south we know how to make sweet drinks!
Coke
Howdy neighbor, really liked the video 🙂
I find this funny. When he mentioned store brands, i thought how BigK cola is pretty good.
Diet coke is garbage most of the time because of aspartam or other bad sugar replacements wich are worse than real sugar.
Im just soda
coke zero sugar
You need to try all the different BBQs in the south and compare them between states. (B's BBQ Greenvile, NC is hands down the best in NC.)
no wonder you have a nice home NC has the best homes!
MatPat laughs when he tastes something disgusting.                                      NOICE.
Coke
did quick research and found that our food 4 less here has a diet cola which has the exact same ingredients from the ones at harris teeter, Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Phosphoric Acid, Aspartame*, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Citric Acid, Caffeine, Natural Flavor.*Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine

20:42 -  21:36  Sounds like the plot for a protag from an anime
I refuse to accept the results of this blind taste test. All the sodas should have been fountain sodas if you're going to include fountain Coke.
Citric acid is the secret ingredient in krabby patties. Must be....
1:29 I want be you so no
Green cola is a bit more healthy and tastes very similar to coke
Drink green cola
Boiling makes great soda but their diet is definitely not where it’s at
Mat, please do this sort of competition for all of the mountain dew flavors
Illegal
I was soda pop what is this trickery
The syrup in soda machines make every soda sweeter just because they aren't measured as precisely as sealed containers. Also bottles are a different flavor do to the plastic its stored in and the way light affects both the plastic and the drink itself even though its very slight. Thats why some beer bottles are green. I'm pretty sure matpat is the one that tought me that actually. I don't remember the episode though. Its was GT
I always just said soft drink
In the UK it's more common than not that generic supermarket soft drinks (that's what we call "soda") are better than their big-brand counterparts. The only drink I exclusively get the branded version of is Irn Bru.
Mat Pat living in NC?! That’s 2 YouTubers I could possibly meet!
I love how mat is like " you probably never heard of food loin " as I live like 5 minutes from Harris teeter and food loin

So it's been over 10 days and still no word on how we can get Harris Teeter in places outside the South East.

INSTEAD OF DIET COKE WHY DON'T YOU DRINK REGULAR COKE
You guys are lucky, in the north the store brands are crap.

The best one is the fountain coke at disney. I know from testing bottle vs fountain a few weeks ago.
Fun fact, I can’t drink Diet Coke anymore due to the fact that I drank too much over lockdown and I’ve developed an intolerance to one of the sweeteners called aspartame so now I get hives whenever I drink any diet or zero sugar drink. So yeah don’t drink too much diet and zero sugar soft drinks kids😂
kING SCOOPERS has is under the BIG K store brand.
Death to subhumans! Sams Cola for the win!
A
It's definitely not a bad idea to try the own-brand stuff. Here in the UK the supermarket Tesco has a brand of cheap sodas that, in my opinion, taste better than the big brand stuff. Plus they're usually cheaper too. It's just too bad my soda addiction is to Irn Bru Xtra, which I have yet to find a better version of.
Alright let’s unsubscribe

Who love coco cola but is diet?? a
I'm so sad that the boylan diet cola was bad. I was just introduced to them a couple weeks ago, and it was their root beer. It was so good I ordered a 12-pack off Amazon. Very good stuff.
meanwhile in gulf we only have pepsi and cola for ðe coke taste
Mountain Dew Zero beats them all but sadly its not a coke.
Soda, and I live in Michigan.
c. soda
just drink saek sake or vodka :p.
Personal theory: The reason Steph may have preferred Coke Zero over other diet sodas is because Coke Zero is designed and flavored to be more appealing to people to who prefer the original soda, or non-diet sodas, but are looking to move to diet sodas. I myself started changing to diet sodas recently, and I've found I like the Coke Zero products far more than the Diet Coke (or Coke Light as it's actually called in Europe) products, because Coke Light caters to people who specifically are looking for the diet soda taste, while Coke Zero is made for people who like the traditional Coke taste.
Where was Pepsi Max
What editing program
I've been living in NC my entire life and just now figured out that Food Lion and Harris Teeter are NC Based?
Fizzy
Interesting citric acid, 2 years ago South Africa passed laws on regulating and taxing on the amount of sugar calories in soft drinks. All the brands went basically tweaked their recipes by changing back to sugar from HFCS, lowering the amounts of sugar and jacking up the amount of citric acid. In most brands it made it taste it way better especially Sprite; except Coke which taste A LOT sweeter.
Other:Soft drink
Jeera cola
Me rn: :O

It's Soda
15:32 I grew up in the Midwest, Matt, and my family just called them both soda & pop. We lean towards more pop now but still sometimes call them sodas. 15:53 That seems to be the brand my dad likes the most lately and we've tried a lot of different brands over the years. You can definitely taste the artificial in some of those and they are just gross! 19:05 Wow! You guys must REALLY be on the same brainwave if you kept going for rock and paper! Was quite a good laugh to watch too. 23:30 Interesting about Kroger. There used to be a lot more stores on that list where I used to live (but in the worst parts of NWI to be clear so I never went to any of them) and now that we've moved there's 3 or 4 I think. Kroger, Fry's, Ralphs maybe and Mariano's sounds familiar. I can certainly try to get some Diet Cola from Kroger but wont guarantee since we're on a budget the past year & if we don't need it, we won't buy. Sorry.
A
In Panamá we call it Soda
Citric Acid. That is why Mountain Dew wins. (Yes, I did this just to start arguments.)
7:15 I see Butterbeer! That stuff isn't the greatest tbh, (I like the Universal stuff better). I also see a lot of brands the grocery store in NWI I used to work at had. I'm not a big pop drinker anymore (thanks teenage years leading to sugar/caffeine intolerance) so I stick with ICE flavored water, the electrolyte mixed berry Walmart generic drink packets, Vitamin Water Zero and Gatorade Zero or G2 Zero. 10:38 My dad will get a 12 pack of that Diet Rite sometimes but he's the only one who drinks that so lasts a while. He's also diabetic so we've been trying to slim down the sugars for everybody in the family the past decade or so. Been working pretty well I have to say (for me & the mom, dad still has a crazy sweet tooth that's gotten his diabetes outta whack more than once unfortunately). 13:08 We had a local grocery store that changed names 3 times in the entire 25 years we lived there and was literally 5 minutes for our house (10 if you walked) and now that we've moved, there's a Target like 10 minutes down the road which I really like over Walmart and Kroger which are both a bit further but under 20 minutes from our apartment.
I am from Texas, so... Give me a coke, yes, Dr Pepper.

I held off on watching this video for a while. I recently got into the habit of drinking diet Coke, and the title/thumbnail for this video, made me think that something crazy was going to be revealed. Like Diet Coke being made with refined death crystals or something.
cokes in brazil are much sweeter :)
D: other
Coke is a brand name. Calling anything that isn't Cokecola brand a coke is stupid. Don't call a Pepsi a coke.
Matpat: so publix Is a grocery store in the southeast Steph: oh and florida ma'am us floridians are the most southeast you can get, particularly south
D:other because i call it A and B
17:24 DOWN WITH BIG CITRIC ACID!!!! Lol
MatPat should be the Gordon Ramsay of diet colas
Lol the reason why the "over a century old" cola tastes like cough syrup is because the original reason to create cola was as a way to get kids to take cough syrup and other oral medications 🤣
Diet sodas are simply worse for you but ok
soda that’s it.
Harris Teeter stock 📈📈📈📈
fun fact coca cola had actual drugs in it and was indeed like a drug.if I’m wrong do it on the show find the original thing!DO IT FOR THE UNWASHED MASSES!oh and people like me thanks man.
it’s the small Amount of stuff from the holder that goes into the tastes.
normal coke or diet Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper yes need that for drink now.give the soda all da soda.
mat pat went from rating foods movies games and now diet soda i am truly amazed to his detacation
Pop
My diet cola of choice is Diet Coke w/ splenda... hard to find, though.
The fact that that one soda tastes like cough syrup and people still buy it concerns me
Since I stop drinking as much, I really enjoy diet soda
I immediately knew the Boylan soda was the one they said tasted like cough syrup. I worked at an Arby's that had a limited release of Boylan soda, and lord that stuff is strong.
Live action MatPat is still an... experience Thanks Food Theory
Food lion is also In Tennessee Matt
k a few years ago when escape the night was a thing I had a crush on mat idk why
I can’t believe the whole time while I was watching this disappointed that Kroger brand diet (my personal favorite) wasn’t included then indirectly be the winner is in fact freakin hilarious😂😂
I learned one thing, Food Lion is North Carolina based. Harris Teeter seemed like “yeah this seems south based” but food lion NC based? was shook

I grew up saying Pop, but here's the funny thing - I still live in the same place/region, and I have switched to Soda.  So I'm not even really sure why the switch, but it feels really weird for me nowadays to say Pop, or when I hear someone else calling it Pop, even though I did as a kid.  But it's completely Soda for me now.
In Cornwall, there are only about 5 sodas... Pepsi, Coca Cola, Lemonade, Dr Pepper and Fanta.

In the Philippines, we call sodas "Soft drinks" so when we'd order, the waiters/waitresses would ask what kind of soft drink we'd want.
Interestingly, I am from the midwest, from Michigan -- and while "pop" is more POPular (hahahaha) over there, I always considered it a yooper thing and insisted on saying soda instead. So, indeed, I say soda to this day.
DRINK CREAM SODA ITS GREAT
I say coke
I call it fizzy drinks (I'm British)
Moral of the story. Mat just supported local over the overlord
I legit call Coca Cola no sugar, Coke No Sugar. That is what I call it.
I agree with Steph on Stevia in sodas. Even as a sweetener for my tea, it just has this real unpleasant aftertaste that I can always spot. Even less heard of natural sweeteners are exactly the same, they all have this weird chemically flavour. Also in the UK, I think the majority of people call soda, pop, just like Matt does.
D: I call it Soft Drink. I don’t know if that’s specifically an Australian thing, but everyone I know calls it that.
that was some regular show episode one rock paper scissors throws
Pop
From what I’ve heard. Coke Zero and coke as a whole tastes way better in Australia. I have never had American coke, but I’ve heard it’s way more syrupy compared to the Aussie coke.
At 1:40-50. Should’t the videos titel say otherwise 🤨.
Dropped soda for Arnold palmer half and half.
Fizzy drinks, tis fizzy drinks I grew up calling stuff, true neutral name
Definitely D: Cooldrink. "What cooldrink do you want?"
it is soda or pop they are the only right option. Soda is what it is so that is right and pop is a euphemism for soda but calling it coke is wrong coke is its own thing. it is like going into a car dealer and they ask you what you are looking for and you say I want an f35B, please.
D, We just call it a drink
So... I did always prefer Pepsi for it's more "unique" taste, but you know what I found in the ingredients? /srs  Citric acid, this is why coke fans Pepsi is supreme /hj  (For the reason of not wanting to be stormed by Coke fans this is a joke, don't come for me I'm stating facts)
Tbh coke Diet Coke is still sweet for me I’m a person who dosent like sweet things very much so I love to drink thumbs up and even better is thumbs up charge it’s not too sweet and super nice and fizzy!
If only you knew Mattpatt if only you knew...diet soda is actually way more unhealthy than its original counterparts
I came for the video and stayed for the history 😅
Diet barqs rootbeer diet cherry coke zero diet wild cherry pepsi... Though...I know many people who love diet coke which tastes like a tin can... vs the much better flavors.

4 other  : minderal
You missed glass bottle coke
Not gonna lie, I knew that if you had "Fred Meyer" cola (Kroger) then you'd pick that one. It's the only diet soda I can stand. I prefer Kroger anything over "on brand" products. I'm a Kroger stan.
I want to bring this up as im not quite sure if its true or not and maybe you can look into it, but I work at mcdonalds and I've been told that they have a deal with coke that allows them to put more syrup in the sodas than normal, its not much but its enough to make it addicting. Hence why mcdonalds sprite is so "crispy"
Hey Siri, Where is the nearest Harris Teeter?
i dont believe that matpat will quit drinking diet coke

they act like its a buttload of soda but tbh it doesnt seem like they drank THAT much. they bought a lot tho XD!  my guess is that they both drank about 4 glasses worth. which idk maybe im just a fatass but seems like itd be easy to down, maybe even double. tho obvi its def not good to do that very often. especially if youre like me and youre tryna cut down on pounds

Diet Cola has this really gross after taste. My dad and I can both taste it.
I wasn't born in a barn, nor am I a monster. It's soda of course.
You should have seeded in the recipe from dr.stone. it might explain that citrous flavor from harris teeter I think maybe?

This reminds me of that one Pokémon go vid he made about why people keep choosing the team that is in the middle right He put Harris Teeter in the middle because he liked it so much, so his brain picked it
they should have revealed the names at the very end it would have been harder to guess and be less biased to the testers
“What drink do you want” “Other” “What kind of Other” “Orange Other”
this isn't fair. fountain is always better unless its from Mickey D's

You and your wife are so cute I love so much that you have grown up with us and that you are doing so well!
I just wanna say if I did this with the labels revealed at the beginning, no matter flavor, I would be biased toward shasta. This is because my grandpa would never bring the mainstream sodas to our family holiday get togethers, instead we would get dr B. and Shasta, all those off-brand classics. It's pure nostalgia for me
down here in good ol' Australia we call it soft drink, which doesn't make much sense does it

The intro: Features Matpat stomping grapes.    Me for some reason: Number 15, Burger King foot lettuce.
Since when did you move to North Carolina?
d= things are a little different in the UK when I'm irish
When I went to New Orleans it was Cool Drink. that really threw me for a loop, in Missouri I always grew up calling it Soda however just a state north of us Iowa they call it Pop. so it's crazy how that changes from region to region.
In Australia we say soft drink. But people say soda sometimes
Harris Teeter walks into a stadium: "Looks like ya'll folks are having yerselves a little baskyball tournament, you mind if my boys here play a little bit.   Wins the tournament.
She's right, Florida is not a Southeastern state even if it's located in the southeast
I love how Stephanie calls MatPat, Matthew, instead of say Matt. It’s kinda cute!
This isn't really a food theory more like a drink review I still really like this episode through
Dude i will mail you a Kroger brand diet cola lol.
Soda
you said kroger and I instantly knew who they are near me (Dillons). Also by shear happenstance sense I drink lots of different sodas (yes soda and I live in the middle of kansas) I was drinking a can of coke zero. My favorite sodas over all though are the ones like sprite/sera mist/7up so I might have to try out the winner, they sound really good.
Pop
I like it in a can better than from fountain. Better fizz, milder sweetness, and never adulterated with melted ice.
I'm a pop guy
Honestly this vid made me switch too. I gotta agree with the final choice.
Mat has found a new soda..... congrats new soda.... you have joined quite the community. 😆
Pop
Tab, it's all about tab cola
What about sprite
Wouldn’t it to happen to be that I actually work at a Kroger in the drug department
I've been waiting for this. I suggest tea. Or flavored water. For your health. I say, going into this thinking it'd be about how terrible soda is for you.
As soon as Steph said "It tastes like cough syrup" I'm like...oh. that's that unchanged formula of that 1890s coke...whatever it is
Going to college in the Michigan being from New York and getting weird stares for calling it soda will always stick with me
I never liked cola to begin with. It's like the worst flavor of soda besides ginger ale. Diet cola is even worse. I only ever drink it because in most places it is the only diet option available.
For heaven's sake you two are the same person sometimes XD
food lion has the best sodas
Imma c coke
THE CITRIC ACID CONSPIRACY!
Diet Coke’s probably regretting not giving the theorist that sponsorship. Missed opportunity.🙃
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I said Pop growing up, but whenever I am working in a professional setting I say Soda.
Jokes on you I haven't had soda, coke, or coffee in years. Except that one time my brother tricked me into drinking Sprite thinking it was water. I don't count it though. Juice is my one true friend  I got revenge
C: Coke as a term for all sodas
Food Lion’s Knick off Dr. Pepper is also phenomenal.
I say soda
You missed diet coke from a glass bottle. The truthly superior way to deliver coca cola.
My favorite soda is diet dr.pepper, specifically the cherry flavor when they have those movie theater soda machines that automatically put in seltzer or flavoring. Also you forgot to test sodastream’s diet dr.pete EDIT: I am offended by the fact that you think I’ve never heard of food lion. And I live in Pittsburgh, PA
I’m pop
God that rock, paper, scissors match was like Metapod VS Metapod...

Pop
I live in southern Virginia and let me just say, Food Lion cola is NOT better than Pepsi, and this is coming from someone who doesn’t ever reach for Pepsi I’ve Coke
I'm from the midwest and i do not know what you are on MatPat because its obviously soda
In southAfrica its called cooldrink
I swear I am the only person to grow up in the midwest and still call it soda.
Welcome to d Drink.. I mean Food t theory
It’s hard for me to find diet drinks because I also don’t like the taste of stevia but I am also allergic to aspartame
I am Coke

Matpat: my allegiance is to the best option. YOU HAVE FAILED ME. YOU ATE SUPPOSED TO SAY: My allegiance is to the republic, TO DEMOCRACY!
Yea here IN AZ i found a fruity and diet cola that is like how you described the Haris teeter soda
You either like pepsi or coke fan. Pepsi products have citrus acid and coke products don't thats why i don't like pepsi
Diet Coke HAS CITRIC ACID just like Harris Teeter.
I call it pop
I didn't know Publix was in your area too lol. I always thought it was Miami company. Lol
Did you know that if you put an open doctor pepper in a fridge it actually gets sweeter
Number 3
I prefer pop rather than soda / coke
Is it because coke is racists and told people to feel bad about their skin color? That's why I stopped
NNNOOOOO NOT THE DIET COKE WHATS NEXT YOU GO VEGAN 😭😥😰
In the UK we call it a ‘soft drink’
Stewart's brand soda is pretty good. Not Stewart's shops, Stewart's brand soda (dunno if they have a cola)
I personally abhor anything diet. I am super sensitive to anything that has nutrasweet, sweet/low, stevia,aspertame,sucrolose , Anything... Just like the host, I can pick out anything that has any "fake" sugars or sugar substitutes. It leaves such a weird after taste on my palette that lingers for a while. Give me real sugar.  Its just a personal preference. Somethign happened to me last week when I got a box of free food fom Harvesters what had syrup in it. I was out of pancake syrup and without looking I used it. I was watching a move and I noticed the difference. I kept thinking, maybe this syrup is old, out of date.. NO.. after I finished  , I looked at it and there it was, "LITE" syrup . Lite or diet.. I avoid just my humble opinion. dont mean to trigger diet users. Id love to take a blindfold test.  Im from NY.. living in MO.. I say SODA. They say POP a lot on Kansas
Food lion is in Tennessee
I would like to know everyone thoughts on the cinimon toest crunch thing with general mils . The story goes resent a consumer bought a two pack of the product and found shrimp and what looked like rat droppings in there breakfast on both bags . GM responded by saying it was just cinnamon that didn't mix right .
Drink Monster Energy, it has some sugar free varieties Haha
in the famous words of the guy from fallout 4... "drink. some. water."
I'm from Southeastern Wisconsin.. I've Always Called It Soda
in india its _coldring_ (cold drink)
in england its coke
Color me surprised that Matthew likes the one that packs “that fruitiness at the back end of it”
Also very fruity? Matthew
I am soda
No RC Cola? Great video!

I loved that Sans theory
food lion's parent company is Belgian/Dutch

I'm other
Here is boston we used to call it "Tonic". I know kinda odd.
*lets take a moment of silence for that wasted diet coke in the title*
My Coke Zero obsession is on par with Matt's Diet Coke obsession...
Matt resembles Jake Peralta
Mat:  It has to be available in my area.  Now itroducing to your area: The Internet.

As a current NC resident, this is good to know.
The crabby patty secret ingredient: citric acid
Are they both saying both as “bolth”??
We love our soda stream, but we stick to just regular cola 😂
Food lion is in tennessee, georgia and I think Alabama. I know this because I live in the most north eastern county in alabama
Mine here in denmark is sodavand lol just for fun :D
In Brazil, Coca Cola just sue every other small soda producers, even buy any competitor if they can't sue them (because they don't produce colas). And if everything fails pay some real money to shame other producers. Dolly Guarana is getting a hard time, coca cola even pay accountants to not pay taxes just to get Dolly's owner to get arrested. So, we don't have so many colas to try in Brasil.
WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????????
Other...
Just drink sprite, Fanta, and Mountain Dew. They’re the best.
Why did you quit I thought you were an addict for Diet Coke

Geography shouldn't be a problem, if you find a soda you love in another state just plan a trip every few months and buy a couple of pallets.
youve probably never heard of food line unless you live somewhere with one or if you played nascar thunder 2004 and saw it as a sponsor to put on the car every time you would go to put ford on the car (i was the second option)
You should try store brand saltines, they are way better than the normal saltines
New name
Didn't see that coming
I grew up in NW Florida saying Coke. But as the internet became more of a thing and I started taking to people not from the South more often, I switched to calling it Soda.  Now I love in Ohio and everyone says Pop and it just will never sound right to me.
Just drink Dr. Pepper boom problem solved
"FOOD LION" home of the "CHA CHINGS"!!!!!!! Great chips!! not HER'S though!
I’m watching this at 12:15 am and I’m loving every second of this
I’m an OG GameTheorist fan and I’ll always remember him as the frontman to the killers

The diet colalympics
Get a soda stream, and make your own soda syrup. I use not-Kool-Aid powder mix.
coke definitely
What you mean matpat Game Theory and film Theory YouTuber is quitting Diet Coke the thing that that is in a lot of videos why this is before I watched it
Could be a Canadian production issue but I find cans of Diet Coke within the same case of 24 or 36 often don't taste consistently between each other.
Normally people who don't like Stevia is because of either....  A. They're too addicted to sugar. B. Even tho it has Stevia, it has sugar byproducts which beats the purpose of Stevia. C. It uses Stevia in the raw which is a horrible brand
Just get club soda and mix it 50/50 with your favorite juice (cranberry etc)
I used to love real coca cola but we found a cheap knock off brand at aldi's called summit cola and after drinking that for a month we prefer it even though it's a third the price
Lol targets brand good and gather's abbreviation is gag
Boylan's diet cola may not be anything, but their root beer is arguably the best on the market
*AHEM* Virgil's Root Beer.
He has too many theory channels
I just watched a man review diet sodas for 20 minutes
I'm guessing you don't have RC in that part of the world?
An episode I’d want to see these guys do is the Coke vs. Pepsi tests, specifically the (often debunked and totally false) theory that Coke was made before refrigeration so it tastes best room temperature whereas Pepsi was designed to be refrigerated and tastes best cold.  They’re wrong about why but maybe there’s something to the theory that the temperature can influence which you prefer?
Mountain Dew all the way
Honestly not entirely related but today I found out Dr Pepper has come out with a zero sugar version and I’m so excited because regular Dr Pepper is my #1 soda and Diet Dr Pepper is literally the worst one ever. My low-carb diet is so pumped to try it for myself
Pop 🤘🏾
you should probably stop drinking sodas then how about that?

Matt Patt went sober and now is having a coke relapse! Im screaming
Ok me call it a soda but my grandma calls it pop. She lives in the same state as me and has he whole life. I dunno it weird
At 18:02 you said it was 13th seeded but it was only ten lol
really wanna see the zero calorie cola company show up and say thank you for choosing thier soda
Pepsi 0 = best :)
no offence but she hates everything
I've been watching Matt since the FNAF theories and I gotta say..wow..he's got such a theory-makes u want to listen voice. Soo happy this channel started, been enjoying it as much as Game. I'll happily wait if a Conspiracy Theory Channel is created hehe.
B
in England at morrisons you can buy 2l of diet coke that tastes alright for 17p/$0.23
Wait did I miss something and now I share a state with MatPat? Did not know he moved to NC
We across the pond in Britain call "soda"  as just fizzy drinks or soft drinks
I quit coke and soda about 2 years ago
I'm a "soda" guy, because I wasn't born in the 1800s.
noooooo
I use pop, soda and soda pop depending on situation
I refuse to drink any cola product.  icky poo!

Johnny Lawrence asks for his red jacket back.
if you guys are taking suggestions, Merchant's Craft is a northwest brand you should try. I'm personally in love with their Doc Merchant and Huckleberry sodas but their Cola is great and I'm sure their diet Cola is just as good.
Here in Europe we have a food lion called “Delhaize”
but hey, ITS JUST A THEORY,a diet coke theory
I went to harris teeter when i visited north carolina and i couldve sworn i saw you didnt want to ask you because i was nervious
steph looks so pretty
[Mat’s choice of number one]  Steph: [surprised Peepachu face]
You should do a video on the "healthiest" energy drink. After all we all know that energy drinks are extremely bad for you. Which one would be the best poison for you to drink?
B: Soda
We of The South do not actually consider Florida to be in The South.
So is it Harris Teeter Diet Soda or Harris Teeter zero calorie soda cause the zero calorie soda as used in the graphic doesn’t have citric acid in the ingredients. I’m just wondering if I bought the correct soda or not?
I say "soda pop"
You two need to do a food theory episode about TEETH because you guys are definitley doing it right. Both of your teeth are so nice its actually distracting from your already entertaining content.
The answer to the problem of soda was already solved by sugar free monster tho 🤔
she looks like the girl from get out
I can't hit the bell?
Im surprised that diet pepsi original was beaten
Nice I live in NC as well and I love hearing all of these NC drinks
you can drink other things than soda, i drink water to every meal and when i'm thirsty

How is this a food theory?
I Australia we call it soft drink
B:soda but in Icelandic my natives Language I’d say gos which can be translated to eruption. Fun fact I guess
15:31 we call it cola
I just drink nominal coke  And I have diabetes it was a bad idea
Pepsi MAX ALL DA WAYYYYYYYYY
Matpat: Quits diet coke. Diet coke, staring at matpat in shock after being betrayed: What an ending........what.....an......ending.
Hmm... so you enter the fountain diet coke (the best one you say) and you pit it against bottled or canned versions of other diet/zero sodas.  Not quite sure how fair that is unless the differences between fountain, bottle, and can are relatively small.  Regardless, the bottled ended up beating the fountain diet coke, which was surprising.  I assuming there was no plastic taste (imaginary or real) in the zero calorie cola, since neither of you said anything about it.
Hey MatPat and Steph! Iiiiif you can get your hands on a bottle you should definetly try "Fritz Cola". It's a german Cola brand that hasn't been around for too long. It was a little start-up business and is now a serious competitor to Coca Cola in germany. You should really try it! I prefer it to the original Coca Cola by now!
should have tried Sioux city sarsaparilla
Matpat with no coke?! Reality itself in collapsing!!

Shut your eyes and tell your wife to shut her mouth
They love colour red hah
Review this next! https://youtu.be/B5z72nTBJek
For those who read comments before the video ends, scroll back up. Don't let them spoil the ending. Just trust me.        That being said: I'm not surprise the hipster "artisan" "specialty" "premium" bottle sodas tanked. One of the big things those kind are all about is "real cane sugar" which is indicative of one of the small ways the world is going downhill, as it used to be the default sweetener and now its like this premium thing. In the non-diets, its quite easy for a corn sweetened to get a really jacked taste. IDK about "sugar is sugar" from a health view, or a political one, but cane sugar is far superior to corn in the taste category.  At any rate the old timey themed luxury special sodas lean heavily on that sugar cane bringing the sweet forward so they can get creative with the rest of the flavor to get something different enough that it feels worth the extra dollar. When they try the same formula stacked with aspertaine  or whatever other science chemical, well...Food Theory certainly knows now.  Store brands are used to cutting corners, which means they have been in the corn syrup game longer. The store brands are better with garbage sweeteners, since they are used to NEVER having real sugar, but a science chemical whether diet or not, so the diet soda game is going to be inherently strong
I’m from Michigan. *We invented it.* It’s called pop.
Her LAV mic wire offends me 😑
Title: 'Matpat quits Diet Coke' Me: *Bruh, total clickbait.*
I don’t even like the cola flavor, and this made me want to drink Harris Teeter Diet Cola
mat pat sonds like recachen youtubers
Or if you don't like the taste of sweetener, there is this new one called, get this...sugar.
Not gonna lie i love the zevia root beer and other zevia sodas
Wow MatPat just really got all the bases covered when it comes to theories 😂😂😂
We have foodlion in georgia too
My band teacher is making us do march mania 2021 and it's really fun and exciting to see the marches fight off for championship
Jokes on you matpat. I used to go to food lion with my grandma and cousins all the time! (I was born in North Carolina. And i was a Soda kid growing up)
I'll try a Kroger's frys diet cola next time

Whos mattpatt?
When MatPat said assembled at the 2 minute mark I started thinking about the avengers
It seems like Cane Sugar cola just doesn't do well with trying to be healthy-ish
I haven't had Diet Rite in a good minute. Didn't think you'd be being back memories for me, Mat.
I didn't know Matpat is trying to find a soda better than diet coke. I remember the first time he mentioned his love for diet coke and that was all the way back in 2012.
Oh are those plastic straws? Those morons on Twitter gonna try and cancel our boy matpat now
Forget diet coke go the way of Dr pepper
As a life long North Carolinian it's very strange to see and hear brands and locations I grew up with (raised South East Raleigh off S. Saunders St.), it's comforting since I moved a couple hours south.
3:40 with subtitles
Matt, you're my diet coke brother. From one brother to another, (ps, im not talking about sodastream, im talking about a legit commercial grade soda setup with fresh ingredients) get a fresh metal canister of diet coke syrup and get a carbonation setup going. Its the purest form of diet coke you can possibly have. Its brand spanking new every time you make it. Its delicious. Its crisp. Its fresh, and its very inexpensive in the long run. Plus, you can experiment with adding a touch more syrope, or a touch more carbonation or less etc.  Its the endgame for us die hard diet coke men.
I counted 17 indirect kisses
Yeah thanks
You might try organic stevia. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I had my first Diet Coke today...and now I know why he's hooked on it
I work for a very big private label in my country and usually big private labels develop their own recipe for their sodas even If they come from the same factory. So the other brands probably wont have the same taste as the harris one sry!
Oof personally I love pepsi and or diet pepsi
Bye

look, i grew up in nc too, and i can confirm, NO ONE calls it coke down here, its soda
FANTA FOR LIFE
Don't you love how whenever Matpat says a flavor is awful he goes for another sip
Yo Matt, products sweetened with stevia do not taste good if you have recently had something with other sweeteners or sugars. Try stevia products when not consuming other sweet things.
Just stop drinking soda, I went from soda, to tea, to water in just a span of a few years. Its amazingly not good for you even if it is diet, I'm concerned about your health man.

My 3.5-year-old can recognize and identify Food Theory and Film Theory videos. And sometimes goes, "BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY."   I don't think this is one of YOUR special interests, so it's probably not actually a prospective fourth channel, but... Juniper, leaping around the living room, just announced, "There's a new Cat Theory video! It is called: Why Cats Don't Like Water. There's also another one on Why Do Cats Go To The Bathroom."  Oh, I'm alarmed. Apparently there's also "a Food Theory one on Lola's poops." That sounds TERRIBLE.

Ah, I thought you were going to talk about health effects of diet vs regular soda or something interesting like that. Bummer...
I was/am born and raised in the south, Arlington, Texas, and I call it soda. That's so weird. People must think I'm from another area.
Thats probably the best, free advertisement for a no-name Coke ever... and more effective than anything they could have bought with the budget for the whole year.
The normal Big K cola is way better classic Coke too
ZEVIA IS THE BEST SODA (sorry for screaming)
Coke is my soda of choice. what's yours comment it
And club lemon... Oh so good!
Hey Mat, whenever you have a chance, you should try the soda that's created here in México, it's known that for some reason (worth a theory, I'm gonna leave it there for your curious mind) the cola made here in Mexico has a stronger and better taste than what can be gotten in the US. And I'm talking Coca-cola not local brands, which are also very good.  Would love if you check that out.
Other we in Ireland just call it fizzy
I don’t think the title is a theory
Matt should do "Why are the McDonalds ice cream machines always broken?"
Next thing you know Matt stops drinking Harris Teeter Diet Cola :)
Great minds think alike.
pop
Did you know that the general cola flavour can be created by cilantro and lime sweetened with honey, sugar or any sweetener.
im say soda even though i grew up around people saying pop
Always has been pop for me.
Me: *trying out different sodas for 12 hours* Me: There all the same.  I am A. and B. cause I live in the south east and I like to call it soda and pop.

This has the same vibe as ProZD's video about finding a subreddit for something you're interested in.
I say soda
im so shocked you didnt do a homemade dr stone style one... like wtf.. combine anime theory with food theory
I already Quit Diet soda Long time ago I never liked Diet Soda cause of its Artificial Sugars taste ~.~" P.S I do love Splenda Cola that coca cola Sells It was the first Diet soda I was enjoying 🙄😁 P.S.S we Call it Pop or Soda ... But soda most of the time but kids call it Pop
soda
Finally
Sucralose is actually quite unhealthy Also, I call it a 'soft drink'.
Diet pepsi is garbage
Me having lived in North Carolina for the first four years of my life and visiting every year, so I know both food lion and harris teeter. My parents legit still have a fine sugar container from food lion, that they have refilled multiple times because they like the container
What did they do with the coke that didnt make it?
Look dude, Congrats. I have a teacher who only drinks diet coke and he will probably never stop. Props to you.
Drink the boylers if you want to be immune to the taste of couch syrup
Here in South Africa, we don't use pop but we don't use soda often, we call it  a cold drink.
There is a coca cola container that is glass it's my favorite
Soda
I do like the Kroger sodas
6:05 to 6:14 Florida is it's own country   I also have a harris teeter near me and I am happy to hear they made something good enough to dominate the top soda brands.
mat: so btw- detist: i saw the video

Food lion is in Virginia
I used to work at hannaford which is the same company as food lion but up northeast. Almost all their sodas were good.
B: Soda
This video speaks to my interests.
Fountain and canned sodas are always better tasting than bottled, oddly. Fountain being the better of the two.
Matt pat: sodas of the world sponsor me Markipier: can vegetables of the world sponsor me Me: coincide? I THINK NOT!
I live in north carolina too... yay
matpat pls get help you are clearly not stable
Virgil cola flavor
I am Working in the Food/Beverage industry in germany. Juice industry to be exacly. Germany is the country which drinks the most juice and i can tell you citric acid is so. So incredible important and can change the taste of the product so much
I don't think you should use a straw. It lessens the taste, as you know since you have already talked about on the wall-E film theory (great theory btw).
Im a carbonated drinks
Well, I live in Scandinavia, so the sugar ratios aren't the same at all. Additionally, we have no Harris Teeter's, so Cola Zero it is! (All though I prefer Fanta and 7Up, lol)
I quit all soda. I don't have any cravings for it anymore.
bruh i'm midwest too and i ain't ever heard anyone call it pop
I can't understand how someone can like diet Coke. To me it tastes so bad I can't even finish one glass.
*is already subscribed* How about a click on the subscribe button? *Unsubscribes* :P
Always drink the normal sodas and not the diet or no sugar drinks cause they have way more preservatives in them and preservatives are bad for you in big amounts
Will you ever cover the szechuan sauce topic?
I'm a Pittsburgh boy and I cook cracc with soda and I drink pop
i just call the drinks by their name tbh
Cherry vanilla coke is truly the best flavor of soda second only to code red mountain dew
Isn't it kinda biased because they are from the south ergo, those drink ara catered to their regional likings were as the bigger brands have to think of worldwide production?
I'm from the midwest and I call it soda
Is the woman your sister?
The only good diet coke is from the fountain Strictly cans or bottles it would lose right away
This isn’t real reality is breaking down

Food theory: I don’t care.
I feel like his "I quit!" Is still just a shill. He would sell out in a second. Seems like he is still reaching for it, just in a different way. Tell me I'm wrong.
3:47/24:31 im not gonna say anything turn on subtitles         ....
Diet cola is nasty. sweetener tastes nasty in cola. Actual sugar is better. Don't hate me.

Should have run the whole competition as a blind test, only finding out the brands after you've picked a winner...May not have been as entertaining though.
Here in Mexico there is an H-E-B only hill country fare cola, and it tastes better than any other, I don’t know about the diet type, but, at least the normal one does taste better
Ok for the Matt pat your a very smart person yet did you not think about the 30% of what you drink with that straw goes back into the straw. HaHa it's a joke ofcourse
Diet soda sucks I'd rather die with a huge triple cheeseburger with bacon and a nice large regular coke in my hands
Citric acid, on its way to becoming a meme on this channel. I wonder if that's the real secret ingredient of Krabby Patties? Citric acid, MSG, and marketing hype. Delicious.
when i was 8 i was visiting my cousins in america and i never had coke before and they had a full fridge, long story short i drank, every single coke in the fridge
Must be a lot of theorists near me. Went to the local Kroger to find their version of your "better than Diet Coke" the day this came out, found it and it was pretty good. Went again today to get another bottle and out of all the soda in the store, it was the ONLY one completely sold out. That can't be a coincidence lol
Just drink regular coke like a true american
Zevia is better with fruit flavored sodas just so you know
Ever heard of water?
Sprite is the best
Forget all of that garbage. Try kvass!
Honestly, diet sodas are all sorts of terrible for you, you'd be a lot better off drinking regular. My family accidentally discovered Dr. Pepper cream sodas and we've been loving it. That'd be something to consider
I brew beer for a living a do this same thing with those drinks, but I never realized you could do this with soda with the same amount of detail haha anyway solid vids man keep it up
In Australia Stevia is almost in every drink diet or not so I have TRYED to find something that does not have Stevia

Try diet mountain dew just trust me best drink period.
Kroger’s Diet Coke brand name and style is nasty looking.
A pop
They messed up with the stream soda, they probably added too much carbonation.
I think that I found your Harris Teeter soda at Kroger. Big K "Cola Oh!" seems to come close to matching your description of the HT diet coke (their other diet cola has a slightly different, but strong diety taste to it). I can't tell if the sweetness in it is just the sweetener or if it's fruity. It could really go either way for me, it's kind of like monkfruit in taste, but duller.
Can they rise to the occasion of our food nation?
soda reviews of kroger stuff shows that they like their citrus flavor powers in it and a mexican one too fresca I think idk
I remember after middle school honor band we had Shasta and this one kid got the worst flavor ever, it was some gold or pink colored can.  He insisted on drinking the whole thing and someone else's can, even though he looked physically pained at the taste.  We begged him to stop but he had none of it.
B
They should have all been fountain, bottle, or can to make it fair.
Im B team all the way! TEAM SODA POGGERS :O
Plot twist: he switched from Diet Coke to Diet Pepsi
i wonder how different dr pepper is
Stevie definitely takes some getting used to, and it DOES NOT cover up bitterness at all, but it's good once you get used to it being a different sweetness than sugar.
I know so many people who get big gulps twice a day full of diet coke it's a weirdly respected soda. That's really addicting

I switched from Diet coke to the smiths store brand coke zero (called big k coke zero) a few years ago. I bet its the same as what you have done.  Utah for reference.  I had drank Diet coke for 30+ YEARS so this brand is no joke.  Oh and in Utah you are asked if you want a "soda" at a restaurant or as a guest.

"While coke is the original boylan kept to their recipe for over 100 years"  I mean...pretty sure we *don't* want the original recipe to Coke Cola seeing as it gave people neurotic symptoms...and you know....replaced soldier's morphine addictions. So you know...lovely stuff.
I consider this scientific evidence that Pepsi sucks
D. Fizzy drink im English
Diet coke is awful
ROYAL
the diet coke broke his own rules sort of  if being able to get it is  BIG factor then unless matt intends to only drink soda fountain diet coke he should be comparing the other offerings to whatever coke hes most likley to consume on a daily basis  if matt is a majority can drinker it should be cans if he primarrilly drinks bottle then bottle comparing the best of diet coke against the average of the others means that some which would beat out a lesser diet coke that gets consumed more often gets dropped prematurely

For those who STILL havent heard about it, aspartame CAN cause symptoms nearly identical to multiple sclerosis. A study was conducted by over a dozen universities and research hospitals years ago suggesting that up to 50% of all multiple sclerosis diagnoses are miss diagnosed aspartame overdoses.

The only soda I drink once in awhile is ginger beer now.
Funny enough, I got a brisk ad on this vid.
Before starting this video, i can already tell you that Coke Zero is the best by far.

Hay matt pat I just thought of this question I thought you would answer it my favourite sour sweet (aka candy) ever is toxic waste its super strong sour my question is can a toxic waste sweet (aka candy) be beet in sourness how sour can you go before you get to pure citric acid?
this is actually horrible

Why run a competition where the predetermined favorite Soda gets a bonus of being the fresh fountain version versus packaged competitors...
I used to work at a dairy plant for Kroger. If you want organic milk and you see two different products in a Kroger owned store like Fred Meyers. Look for that small Kroger label. Not all of the milk Kroger has in its stores are from the Kroger plant. But if you are deciding between two and they both have the Kroger label. Get the cheaper one. Not always but the majority of the time they both contain milk from the exact same farm or group of farms
B soda.
This is funny, I'm from Mexico and some regions in Mexcio also say coke (coca) but then you need to specify whether is a sprite or a dr pepper or an actual coke!!
Moxie is the best soda of all time

What they should have done is not revealed the drinks to them until the end and just showed the viewers to get the least biased opinion in the end.

The three diet cokes was the wrong way to go about it, what if fountain was better than every soda in a can? It should have been all bottles, all cans, or all fountain.
Better idea. Don’t drink soda often, but when you do just have a normal soda. Diet is disgusting!
It's pop. 😝

Eating the FOOD has changed him                         Obey the Server...
And the 16 cola's are probably made at 4 different facilities... Just slight recipe differences between brand batches.
If you don't like Stevia, you're probably actually allergic to it.
No god no god please no no no nooooooooooooooooooo!
I love how matt and Steph seem to be having fun in this channel :3 it's so good
One of the coolest things that came out of the Pepsi challenge was that a quick taste can confuse your senses. Pepsi was preferred over Coke a GREAT majority of the time, but sales of Coke went up in response to the taste test. The reason is that Pepsi was sweeter but didn't have the balance that Coke did, and the small sample you were given wasn't enough to make a more informed decision. I wonder if that was an issue here.
mat, where can I get the red jacket.....asking not for a friend

Imagine if Harris teeter does the same thing as honey ohs and quoted mattpatt on the bottle
That may be your opinion, but again. OUTRAGE!

I am a fizzy drink person
There is no good diet soda. I have never found any soda called "diet" that didn't taste sour.  If diet soda does anything for you, it's that it punishes you for thinking that you want a soda when you're on a diet. Nobody drinks diet Coke "just for the taste of it", because anyone who drinks Coke knows that it is at least three times better tasting than the diet stuff. If you're on a diet, just don't drink soda. If you're not on a diet, you're an idiot to buy diet sodas.
*WHY ARE IN MY OPINION EVERYONES FAVORITE SODA IS IN BETWEEN DIET COKE AND DR PEPPER*

Ok but idea: A food theory video on donuts. I’ve realized over my years that some donut shops, when you ask for say a cream filled donut, they’ll give you either a lot or a little. So here’s the question- What donut shop will put the most cream in your donuts?  You could run this experiment at places such as Dunkin’ Donuts, gourmet donuts, krispe kreme (Idk how it’s spelt) and any local donut shops!

I personally think glass bottles taste the best, its always fresh.
there’s people that don’t have food lion?        im praying for you
As a diehard pepsi fan, even I can agree that Pepsi isn't exactly good. Don't think they're trying for the #1 diet soda slot either, and are just filling spots their main competitor coke is in.  Also, while I do appreciate you're advice for finding the soda Harris Teeter sells, the closest Kroger store to where I live is a days drive there and back. I think I'll stick with Pepsi and Signature Select.
Me after looking at the thumbnail : oh no.
I love that pitcure that you use in 3 channel
Hi matpat✌🏼 big fan from the beggining in game theory btw. can u make a theory about the vegan teacher’s unhealthy advice like not having children or her obsessive goal of making the entire world vegan? I would love that vid
When i see this channel vedio i socked i see your 2 channels game'film theory than i see your third channel i say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatt okey i will search your more channels
id recomend fanta or diet dr pepper also hope the wife and you are happy
This is not a cola but Fanta is my favourite drink and I’m also not sure if there is a diet version
Ok not going to lie i thought this man was a loser who does not come out of his room
In Australia, for carbonated drinks we say soft drink (probably in contrast to a hard/alcoholic drink), in terms of cola you generally either grab a Pepsi or a Coke and half the time you need to check which brand the shop stocks first or you can end up with some awkward stares. There are some more local brands in supermarkets but they are generally treated in line with the store brand products. Not to mention most supermarkets in Australia belong to either of our 2 big supermarket chains so there isn't really any variety there either.
Canned Pepsi max is my favourite drink!
We call them fizzy drinks in the UK.
Given that the branding and colours of some of the less-well-known bottles match Coke so much I'm surprised they haven't been sued.
For normal not diet soda pepsi is far better than coke and everyone who says otherwise is wrong

Are there any Kroger shops in the UK? I wanna try some of that cola!  Either way, I'm definitely going to be checking out some of the cheaper cola brands from places like Poundstretcher, Poundland, Heron Foods etc. I had a theory ages ago that cheapo cola tastes just as good as the expensive stuff and my wife tried to tell me I was wrong, but I wouldn't listen until I tried the cola from Asda that's like 14p...it's not nice. But as it turns out, I there ARE cheaper brand colas out there that as good as the top dogs, you just need to find them!

I am also ADDICTED to diet coke, I hate drinking anything else.
I drink regular coke

The same thing happens with Dr Pepper. Different sources are distinctly different.
How hard can it be to impress you with soda. You like diet fucking coke
C. or B.
B Soda. From a historic nomenclature angle, it is literally the _only_ right answer. Humans have been calling it "soda water" for multiple *centuries* at least. So there is no grounds for any sort of debate just because people also like to create new slang terminology as they go along through the decades.
That's really funny because I just moved to Colorado and have a King Soopers right next to me. Best diet cola!!!
Vita Cola ohne Zucker
Minnesotan here. I call it soda. I'm weird.
If you're just taking little sips you're just going to end up with the sweetest one. If you look into the Pepsi sip test they used the fact that if you just have a small sip you'll usually pick the sweetest one rather than the one you could drink a whole can of to give themselves an edge.
Hear me out: Aldi dark chocolate sea salt caramels. BEST CARAMELS EVER.
I feel like the citric acid thing runs deeper... Do I smell a future food theory?
So u live in north Carolina and not California thanks good to know.........
That's it: I'm getting a Big K diet cola

Matpat please listen to me when I say all type sodas are bad I am a liver patient and when I saw my liver doctor he told me never ever drink diet sodas alcohol in moderation is okay but diet sodas will roy the liver faster and can eventually cause cancer
diet dr peper tastes almost exactly like normal dr peper. its only downside is its expiring date
zevia is good i will die now
if you like diet coke that much don't stop, or ya know just smoke weed
I'm on Steph's side back when I drank diet I drank Diet Dr Pepper & Coke Zero if ya want something fruity get something fruity you want Root Beer find one you like I prefer Mug you want Lemon Lime I prefer Sierra Mist I still drink Sprite and for all you people who literally say Melloyello is similar to Mountain Dew bite your tongue I can taste perfectly well and Mountain Dew to me tastes bad not to much kick or flavor at all to be honest compared to any other pop I have drank. Mat I say drink multiple in moderation instead of choosing one.

Coke for sure!! Sup south Texas
Softdrink in Philippines
Well we still have a Diet Coke king..
I like in Texas and yes we do call all of them coke or cola but we do make sure to be specific when we order or ask for a drink but in the case of "pop" I only hear soda be called that with the older folks.
Not surprised Kroger won, my options growing up for groceries were a Ralph's and an Albertson's and Ralph's always had better stuff.
Food lion and Harris-teeter are in South Carolina yo we have them in our town
I only know food lion because that is where we would shop there on vacation and honestly forgot about since it’s been years we have been down there   I’m a cursed Ohioan by the way
8:23 How can you think that a soda that hasn't had a change in recipe since the 1890's *wouldn't* taste like cough syrup? Cola did originate from pharmacies in the first place.
Bro I was so happy that the fucking grocery store Soto got into the final and pulled off the Cinderella story victory
me just mixing all the soda flavours together every time 👁👄👁
Here in New Orleans, we call everything a Cold Drink. even if it's hot.
You should try Shinola Cola!
Biggest news in a year
I'm "drink".....
uhhh...  Fry's is definitely an electronics store.  Or it was...  RIP
I actually work for Kroger and personally I side with Steph when it comes to diet soda preference, Coke Zero. I have found that Kroger Brand Big K Cola Oh! (Kroger's Coke Zero) decently tastes similar, and a little fruitier like the Harris Teeter you found. Coke Zero in my opinion has a cleaner, more balanced acidity in comparison to store brand.
I only pressed this video because i doubt the title.
I don't really understand why fountain diet Coke is a contestant. Basically, each place that sells fountain drinks gets the soda syrup. And they mix it according to how their employer chooses.  I honestly think bottle should go up against bottle. Can against can and, if you insist fountain is a contestant, then fountain against fountain. Otherwise, this us a rigged contest and it's results are invalid.
The gordan Ramsay of diet cola
I personally like the old fashioned coke 😳
Don't do Coke kids, you come up weird ideas like Sans is Ness! (Couldn't help it)
Okay okay okay hear me out. Dr Pepper just released Dr Pepper zero
Can we do a Root Beer version of this later?
Me coming from East Tennessee and knowing what food lion and Harris teeters is 😲
4:15 OMGosh I relate /so/ much. There is a definite difference between bottle and can for Sprite (Sorry. I only like Sprite). I personally prefer can. Also I call it soda.
My mother quite enjoys Diet Coke and my dad Is in LOVE with Aldi, so she’s tried many of off-brand diets, her favorite was Diet Summit
pop
I’m surprised nerdy Matt didn’t realize that the reason humans love citric acid is because it is the main ingredient in the critical energy pathway the citric acid cycle.... or is it the next theory?
For the "zero calories" I love that he used zero from borderlands 2 and that's actually the same skin I use for him aswell
Just drink the ORIGINAL coke stop acting like the diet is any healthier B_R_U_H
Now I'm unsubscribing
Good to know Harris teeter has good diet soda
They got taste of their own love with the one they hated
The day we never thought we would see...
I hate 85 with a fiery passion I'm sorry
I have bad knees for you matt and Stephanie
Aaaaaaaaaand rip

I feel like Matpat giving up diet coke is a sign of the apocalypse, as if we need another one of those...

You should have had ginger root in between your sodas to cleanse the pallette.

Maple cytoplasm
C: coke
There is a bigger lesson in all of this. No matter how forgotten you might feel, no matter how many time people pass up on you, stay true and consistent. That bottle of diet coke at Harris Teeter was ignored by multiple people, including matpat, until the last minute. However, it was given one opportunity by chance and it came out the champion. You might be reading this as you are sitting on your desk in your office and questioning if you should just quit, but think of your self as this diet cola, you just might, by accident, be given a chance and you might blow people's mind. Be prepared.
matpat that’s a statement not a theory
Most shocking title I’ve ever seen
you got  the right one baby  uh  huh
Are we separating the twins or sewing them together?

I think it's a thing only in Canada, but the best diet cola I've ever had was Pic-a-Pop.  Also, I grew up with Sodi-Pop

I, a shoe  too big for Stephanie and too small for MatPat sorry next XD
I FKING KNEW IT, DIET BIG K COLA IS AMAZING!!! JUST WATCH THE ENDING
what alternate universe hath we spawned into O.o
Pewdiepie is number one How many times will you have to learn this lesson
I know Matt chose stuff local to him, but Save-A-Lot's Diet Bubba Cola is good as well.  As is Kroger's Big K brand 'Cola Oh'.. the latter of which is like coke zero, if you mixed it with RC cola, flavor wise.
Help, I'm trapped wasting my life watching videos on youtube
Nope nope y'all can't copy
That goes in youtubes pandora box
try rc
Firstable shame on you
I will gladly mail you a Big K Diet Cola from Fred Myers if you're interested.

Before the result I was going to suggest you try big k, which is kroger brand
Sprite is always my first choice
In my experience, specialty or artisan makers are very good on regular sodas but fail every time they try to make a diet or 'zero' version. I guess mixing sweeteners isn't that easy.
17:56 i will trun you into pepsi
When               Did I ask?
15:33 pepsi
Diet Coke is a puke fest. Diet Pepsi is the best and the only way. Also I’ve had Diet Rite Cola and it’s not my fave-I Miss their fruit sodas.
Chicagoans representing the “pop” sayers 🤘 also I am surprised you could not find Royal Crown Cola (RC) since it is made near you in Georgia.
Pepsi
14:34 what do you mean it egde out that is disrespect
9:09 PEPSI PEPSI PEPSIPEPSI PEPSI PEPSIPEPSI PEPSI PEPSI
So what I do. Drink soda water with some juice in it or just sort of water by itself. Lost a ton of weight that way.
Hold up I been missing for a min.. since when are they in NC?!?!?

do your body a favor and switch to Mtn Dew
I say pop. soda makes sense. coke makes no sense to me.
Fountain diet coke is the worst... I like the can the best then the bottle
Oh no! Diet coke is my favorite
In Australia they changed coke Zero to coke "no sugar" 😂
Wait Food Lion is only in NC?? Wow i need to get out more
I hate diet coke...why am I watching this?                Because it's Food Theory. that's why.
PEPSI OR ARIZONA RASPBERRY ICED TEA, TRUST ME, THEY'RE GREAT
Coke cikelie
normal coke is wayy better
Next up: The Literacy Theorists
Coke for sure
Drink mineral water, heard it's healthier lmao
You should have drank water in between the two colas to rinse the taste and make the taste test more accurate
Man I thought food lion and Harris teeter were Northern VA based guess I was wrong 😂
Makes me want to go out and buy Big K diet cola to see(though I don't drink diet). Though I wonder how much the diet changes the flavor, because when I was a kid I hated Big K regular cola. To me it tasted like when you put on ChapStick, but accidentally get some on your tongue, which is why I always called Big K Cola, ChapStick Cola.
I almost think that there should've been a double elimination for some things.
Can confirm, here in the south, everyone just calls it Coke
I can taste the difference between Coca-Cola and Diet Coke you see Coca-Cola has a subtle and slight sweetness and rather Diet Coke has a more blander less sweet taste
3:00 into it. ‘I have pku... why am I watching this??’
matpat is the main cause of ma diet coke addiction. he introduced me to the goldly soda and now i can't stop drinking it.
Just putting it out there....I love Cinnamon Coke
I decided to order some Big K cola from my local Kroger chain. While I can't say definitively that it is the same as the Harris Teeter branded soda, it does remind me very much of Diet Coke but with a slight fruitiness, so probably is? I actually like it, but I think I still prefer Coke Zero :P.

I say soda along with my personal favorite of      Fizzy sugar water
6:09 Florida Man here. Us Floridians tend to love Publix, so I can confirm that Flordia does have Publix. However, as a Florida Man, I must maintain my oft-expressed personal belief that Florida is its own region separate from the rest of the United States, due to Florida being Gatorland.
I've only seen a food4less once here in Cali, and it is no where close to where I live.
mat should eat straight up citric acid instead
Soda
probably shouldn't have shown ALL your viewers explicitly where you live, though not specific.
I would love to see you guys do another POP tasting, except with different Ginger-Ales, I want to see what you guys think of Vernors.
this has to be a joke right?
I can hear Matt having a mid life crisis at the end
Being from Florida, I remember Food Lion, but I guess we pushed them out, lol.
You never address how unhealthy aspertain is as a substitute for sugar which makes this WHOLE video pointless. There's a reason why both SODA STREAM and G-FUEL use sucralose over aspertain  as a substitute and the reason is HEALTH!
Diet Pepsi
I’m so happy Harris teeter did well I never finished but maybe they won
Hey! Didn't even watch the video, just thumbnail. Just wanted to say I don't care in the slightest!
Zero calories? Uhm...that ain't quite accurate. These diet cokes all have artificial sweetners wich do get digested and turned into energy so they do count as some calories.
Ask Rhett and Link and they'll tell you Kroger is usually better
20:53 Interesting
Back in my days we call coke”H2CO3”
Diet Pepsi  will always be my favorite diet.
Wheres Dr pepper
Big k is hella good easily one of the best pops around
So Matt is looking for a soda sponsor :D
How could someone LOVE the taste of fountain over... any other option is beyond me XD
It's really funny that you say that about citric acid because the majority of the citric acid made for sodas is manufactured in nc
I swore off all coke products, I don’t support racist companies.
Definitely not surprised Zevia didn't make it. I've tried them before and it was legitimately was the worst soda I've ever had. Sorry not sorry, but I'm also not a Stevia fan.
Huh.... I’m surprised y’all didn’t get RC cola.
Pop gang
They have food lions in West Virginia
Good smiths is in my area I just want to try that fruitiness you said
when I sall this video I thought it was fake lol but cool video
Hey this is just a theory a food theory
Try wAter
Food lion is everywhere here in Maryland, more common than Wal-Mart even, so I'll keep in mind how good their sodas are.
Coke bc I’m from Tennessee YEE HAW lol
:0
diet coke tastes disgusting
soda in Wisconsin
So question Matt Patt. If you put wine in a blender and cause it to aerate more will it improve the flavor. Aging wine is always an expensive thing to do so theoretically you can apply air to the wine to age it faster and a better tasting product within less time.
we used to live in virginia and we had a food loin next to our house
Post-mix diet coke?! You philistine!
I thought that this said I quit youtube
Can we have a food theory on healthier sugars/sugar replacements?
diet pepsi also does not use aspartame anymore
I am a Coke Zero lover. I used to be a Diet Pepsi until  switched their recipe about ten years or so ago. Whenever it was

Pepsi zero. I switched as well
It’s all coke

I interchange all my sayings sometimes i say pop other times i say soda

Well if you quit one and move on to the other it's kinda like going "yeah I quit crack. Now I'm addicted to meth."
Mexican coca cola is way better than American. If you ever visit Mexico taste the coca cola it tastes way better.

Boylan coke is bad but their root beer is scrumptious
She's right about every beverage being called Coke in the south, It's strange. When I visit my parents in TX I get a kick of the differences between Canada and the US.
B soda
C:Coke lol
ide have to say to do a root beer version of this maybe? similar but boylan root beer and cream soda deserve some love. and the leading juggernaut probably doctor pepper. :P
You are also the guy why simultaneously whipped and nae naed
Don't disrespect food lion there here in MD too a few got bought out by Weis markets
I prefer calling it soda, but sometimes use the word pop. However, I get annoyed if someone uses Coke as a general term.
Pop
Gives me flashbacks of doing the Pepsi challenge at HFStival in 2001 😂😂
it is a pity that Jolt Cola finally shuffled off its moral coil.. otherwise its diet version would have been interesting to add.
We call it soda and pop because, my lil bro say orange soda(or orange sprite)for orange Fanta and pop for everything else.🧐
Harris Teeter was the anime protaginist in the tournement.
I see Mat Pat doesn’t know how to make a bracket. In the first round, all matchups should have summed to 17. So, 1 vs. 16 works, but 8 vs. 7 is wrong. Also, then it was 7 vs. 11, which is wrong for having two #7 and not adding to 16. This is basic math!
B:Soda
I’m pop buddy
I don’t like these latest videos Panera bread and diet coke. Do one about the food suppliers and how we have 3 major companies that supply near all the restaurants. You can showcase how food quality really isn’t any different. Also this bleeds over into grocery stores; for example, bacon! The same bacon McD’s requests is in grocery stores because McDs is such a large buyer so making their level of product for all outlets is more profitable for the suppliers. Etc etc. ok... bye!
Wow, I dislike just about all the Kroger sodas, I don't even like the taste of their bottled water xD
Wait WHAT?! Your one striking feature was the diet Coke thing (jkjk).
C:Coke, grew up in florida and then moved to north carolina. Unfortunately, I can't weigh in much for diet drinks since I'm allergic to most artificial sugars, and even a few natural ones. Stevia does just not work with anything acidic though, some teas do alright, but even that's a stretch.
Choke XD
What's your favourite letter matpat
And then there is me who refuses to drink ANY diet cokes, as I can remember one of my old culinary teachers telling me that diet products, or cokes with 0 sugar, actually are bad for you if you don't have diabetes due to some chemical that exist in most of them. And no he didn't say that cause he hated them, he did have diabetes and only drank drinks with 0 sugar.

But normal coke is way better than Diet Coke
Try puffer fish next guys!
Quick question..... Are you diabetic? Why on Earth are you drinking diet soda in the first place? I need you to grab some water and hydrate.
👁👄👁
My favorite soda is Big K Diet Ginger Ale, (Kroger's store brand). I like it better than Vernor's and Canada Dry. Yeap, it has Citric Acid (as the #2 main ingredient; #1 is Carbonated Water.) Unfortunately, it also uses Aspartame.   I'll have to try their Big K Diet Cola to see if it has the fruity critic taste too.
My family has always said Coke for everything lol
*cries in European* I don't think Kroger stuff exists here - also I've always just called it "fizzy drink"
I thought you were just gonna drink less soda. Shoulda known better.. xD

Its "Coke" down south. Regardless if its Sprite, Pepsi, coke, soda is called Coke.  Unless its Dr Pepper. Because not calling that by its name is sacrilege
Matpat we have a foodnlion but its called delheize here
Pop
Coca cola light beats 'em all.  Best cola IMO.
My jaw went through my basement and im in the attic
I work in food service and regardless of whether this comment has been made or not, I’ll make it now. Fountain sodas will ALWAYS be more or less flavorful than canned or bottled sodas because massive bags of syrup are hooked up to hugs machines to dilute it with water :3 depending on how much water the machine allows or what machine is used, fountain soda will taste different no matter where you go
Could have used RC
They forgot glass bottle cola
Soda but I grew up in the Midwest so i don’t know what your going on about.
We have Food Lion here in Northeast Tennessee as well...but we do border with North Carolina...and we call it soda here because we have both Coke and Pepsi bottling location here
they should of been blindfolded like they do on Rhett and link
pepsi zero sugar is known as pepsi max in the UK
I feel like this episode did more to sell Boylan cola than anything, because now everyone wants to try it.
Wait why no Diet Dr. Pepper? If these colas all have bizzarely different tastes, why isn't Dr. Pepper a part of this? It doesn't taste that much different from Coke.
this video made me want a diet coke
I used to drink a bit of ginger root beer zevia and the first time I drank it tasted pretty good the only thing is the sweetness for me was not noticable at all.
I'm from CT and not a single person says anything different than soda.
diet sodas are worse than normal
grab a soda it will help you see faster
Little disappointed in no comparison between actual geographic sources of diet coke (and pepsi as well) as different regions utilise different sweeteners which massively affects the taste. Particularly important for bottles or cans as they ship all over the place, can get 3 different sources in one supermarket over course of a couple months. I tend to find that US diet coke vs pepsi is inverted compared to the UK flavours mainly due to the sweeteners. Also D) Soft Drink

Soda pop
Why diet pop? Why not just drink the regular pop? It's really not that much different.
only soda I drink is regular bepis.
Kroger has just the best soda in general
btw boylan cream soda is very good so it probobly is  just the diet cola
coke
Matt: You have probably never even heard of these grocery stores!  Me who grew up in NC: Y’all really don’t have Food Lion and Harris Teeter! How have you lived?
I always say soda
this guy is going to a be redditor mod
Pop is the standard in Canada
Matthew Patthew?
I live in north caralina
I converted to flavored carbonated water years ago in place of "soda".  It has been an enjoyable supplement as well as significantly healthier for me.  I'd advise the same to anyone else...
B. Soda
We used to have food lion in Tennessee, and the zevia used to be good when it still had color
Drink normal coke? Its ironically healthier
When I saw the title I was like "WTF?"
And Mat went on to inadvertently boost all sales for Carolina store brand sodas

I grew up in Tennessee and South Carolina but in cities and not in the country. We called it soda
I called it before he said it.  I had a feeling Harris Teeter’s brand was Kroger pop.  I pass out Kroger brand cans for Halloween every year and I always enjoy what ever is left over.  I can’t tell the difference between their lemon/lime pops or root beer pops from the name brand either.
*Pepsi max exist*
A:pop
My favourite Cola is Pepsi Max, I don't know if it's the same as Pepsi Zero Sugar or not but here in Australia most people seem to prefer it over Coke.  I've never liked the taste of Diet Coke, when you came here back in 2017 I'm assuming you tried it.  I should have asked when I met you in person but I was way too nervous that day(I'm the guy you posted a picture of on Twitter), is there a difference between Australia and American Diet Coke?

food lion bruh i live in belgium and over here its called delhaize idk why. but its a veeeeery common store here
In Australia we call them Soft Drinks
I'm from North Carolina as well, and knew that Food Lion was a regional grocery store (as are many grocery stores). So color me surprised when I was travelling to Belgium a couple years ago and sitting down to have dinner and beers and see a Food Lion logo across the street.  After looking it up, we realized that Food Lion is owned by Delhaize (then, now its Delhaize Ahold). They've been owned by Delhaize for almost 50 years now. The Food Lion logo which has always been so memorable to me, was actually taken from their parent company, Delhaize, as the store was originally Food Town but needed to change names due to expanding into other regions where there was a (different) Food Town already in operation. So they went with Food Lion because the parent company had a lion in their logo (and probably other reasons as well).  And that's how I came to find an oddly colored Food Lion logo looking back at me when eating dinner in Belgium, a place I never expected to find a Food Lion logo.
15:28 Really? Is this an argument? The answer seems clear as day to me!    *𝔽𝕚𝕫𝕫𝕪 𝕕𝕣𝕚𝕟𝕜*

My favorite soda is Pepsi Zero
F
My absolute favorite cola is the Tecas based HEB brand Zero cola. If you're ever in Texas again you should really try it
Bepis is life. That is all
Somehow I live in NC and thought all this time Harris Teeter and Food Lion were nationwide brands. Am I an idiot? Also Matt, you can't underestimate these southern sodas. Down south here we love us some good diabetes, and we know how to make it right.
She should have done cherry coke zero if fruit was allowed

Zevia root beer does thr trick for me.  Zero sugar.
Next episode: whats up with citric acid? Kfc secret ingredient, different between fruit loops and apple jacks, and great diet soda ingredient...what more?
Weird that Americans call it Pepsi Zero sugar. In Australia it's called Pepsi Max
steph is on point with distinguishing flavors lol
*Impossible*
Do amircans not have pepsi max

I quit soda by weening myself off with Zevia soda! It is good but their are better flavors out there.
Sprite

Aren't diet sodas targeted at diabetics? And artificial sweeteners aren't so healthy also... So why drink diet drinks?
The character arc! The upset! The drama! This is true character progression, Matthew Patthew Amazing work, this is a really interesting concept and cool video
nah
I hate all fizzy drinks but coke especially, and I know none of these brands aside from coke and Pepsi, but I was SO INVESTED in this, the Harris Teeter upset got me so pumped   I think I’ve missed sports lol
Well my mom LOVES stevia. Oof
D.  In Britain nobody cares it changes every conversation
gf: did he finally figure out that "diet" aint siet but more sugar and fating?.. no?.. aright then O^O also Ima coke fan while he love Dr Pepper UwU so if we buy a ton soda supply we would half it and be more fair and easier to tell if someone took extra someone elses soda
What address can I send a pack of RC cola to you? Life-changing.
in germany we actually call everythink "Cola" and I'm usually disappointed them i get Pepsi. But the Lild brand Freeway is better in my opinion
can Any one Explain To me The diffrence between ocacola zero and Diet and allso why can't we in eu Get diet coce
I prefer diet Dr Pepper 🤷‍♀️
I'm from north alabama and we call them soft drinks o.o
does coke not taste better in a glass bottle   I mean what did they do to make it so good
Tried grape zevia the other day and it was awful 😖
So my family and I actually drink Mexican Coke Cola, because it has really sugar instead of ones in cans because it has artificial sugar.
food lion is an affeliate company of Delhaize, a Belgian/french supermarket chain (now owned together with Albert heijn by the same company). I never rly disliked delhaize coke, so I imagine that one tasted similar, but my god, the packaging is dreadful.
down here in southern canada we call it pop
Never thought this day would happen. Who is matpat without diet coke?      At least for awhile. :P
From what i found Big K is the version for pick n save
When I saw the title I was like 'MatPat is gone'...Don't SCARE me like THIS!
I'm part of the fredmeyer gang lol. Anyways I had store brand and thought it tasted amazing! I gotta find me some again it's been years since I went to fredmeyers.
dr diet
D: Other I don't use pop or soda since that seems like an American thing (I'm British) and wouldn't use coke unless I was talking about actual cola. For drinks like Dr Pepper, I would say Dr Pepper or "Fizzy drink"
tesco coke be like bruh
Im from australia so we dont call it soda or pop, we call it soft drink
D in Australia we just ask for the drink by name
we aussies pick D. Other... we call it Soft Drink. i have NO idea why though!
Im a soft drink guy myself
B . Soda lol
I gotta say diet Dr pepper is best  We say soda
I drink normal Coke but not Diet Coke, would much prefer a Pepsi than a Diet Coke.
That's hilarious man! Go the bottom rung of cola! Oh and just to add to your Soda / Pop war. In Ireland we actually call them, Minerals or Soft Drinks.
they sippin lean
One does not simply quit Diet Coke
The world shall end soon
Lies in the beat the heat episode he ate it and that was at 2020

*Your very first bracket sours the whole entire experiment. The only way to salvage it from the premise of the first bracket, would be to have every initial first bracket also follow the 'can~bottle~fountain' entry criteria.*

Grew up in chicago calling it pop, moved to Texas and started calling it soda, so now I mix the two.
We call it Cooldrink...,  But also Twissa,which is a local brand that make a variety of Flavours Cola, Lemon and Lime, Mango, Guava,Boabab,Grape, Orange,Cream Soda, and much more
I love food lion
maybe you shouldn't drink any diet drinks since the artificial sweeteners mess up the bacteria in your bowel
Other in new Zealand we call it fizzy
I'm really enjoying these live experiment episodes.  There's something comforting about them!  Also, I'm a sucker for synergy so callbacks to previous episodes are always going to make me smile.  Oh, and where I grew up in the UK, we called them 'fizzy drinks' because we're an imaginative bunch! Also hearing Steph say 'bloke coke' is the quote of the year!
As someone who works in a food factory that also produces private label products I jus want to explain something. Even if a product is manufactured in the same factory, it does not mean it is the same product. Recipes for the products can differ. Though there is offcourse a chance that it does have the same recipe.

Soft drink
The fountain version is the best?!
If that fountain Diet Coke came from McDonald's, it could taste 'sweeter' because McDonald's apparently puts a different ratio of syrup to water to accommodate ice melt, and that cup seemed to have no ice whatsoever. The more you know.
wanna sprite cranberry?
The water matters a lot as well.
How dare you, Diet Coke traitor.
I've heard that people in the south refer to all soft drinks, sodas, pop, as "Coke" but I've never experienced this phenomenon... and I'm from Georgia... two counties away from where coke was INVENTED...in my experience most people around here refer to all soft drinks as "Soda" collectively... I think the confusion about southerners calling ALL soft drinks "coke" likely comes from the fact that when most people from Georgia say they want Coke... They mean they want "Coke" the original"Coca-Cola" because that is *By Far* THE most popular choice... we're not calling all "soda" _"Coke"_ we're refusing to acknowledge most other soft drinks even exist... there is only coke...      ... ... ...and Dr.pepper too I guess 😒
We call soda soft drinks os its other
I say coke. But I used to call it fizzy juice because we don't have a word for pop or soda In the UK
I would like to point out that Splenda brand Sucralose is not a healthier Aspartame substitute. It's literally just a brand name for the exact same product. Literally any artificial sweetener is made from Aspartame, you're just looking at a different brand name for the same product. And sorry to tell you, but every diet drink on the market contains Aspartame, you're not suppose to use it because it's actually worse than sugar but they do it anyway because there is no other options for a sweetener other than either Aspartame or sugar.  I had to research this stuff back in high school for a class and I learned way more about this crap than I ever wanted to. Long story short, Aspartame is the reason I would rather drink a regular soda and skip diet entirely.  Oh and to answer your question... Pop is something only people over 60 say. You don't look over 60 Mat... What the heck? Coke is a specific brand name and you're just factually wrong if you refer to anything other than actual literal Coke a Cola as Coke. What the heck Steph. The correct answer is Soda.
gross diet coke tastes like concentrated donkey sweat
as a pepsi fan, it would be nice to have a new member of the pepsi army (before I watch) after: dissapointed.
Who is this idiot?  For some reason of idiotic youtube logic he showed up.  He seems like a 20 something version of hooptie.  At a little past 1 minute this child caused me to leave.
I’m D
heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey I dont drink soda never in my lifee
In the philippines we call it, dreenks, with two e's.
I always thought Pepsi was crisper and more refreshing than Coca-Cola. I know it’s probably a very unpopular opinion, but it’s how I feel.
i feel like everyone here in the uk says it’s pop or fizzy drink
Quite the surprising outcome.    Honestly, I don't like artificial sweeteners at all, so for me diet anything is out.  IMO, They taste really bad, and worse they make me FEEL bad after a several sips. however, IMO, splenda is definitely the better tasting of the three(aspertame, splenda, and stevia).  I would much rather have a regular cola, with real sugar instead, when I can find it.  it very much seems like a seasonal item in some stores.  Coke Life seemed like a good idea, but it never really sold in my area, because it was only ever available in 4pk glass bottles, and nobody's gonna drop $6 on 4 11ish oz bottles to experiment with.  needless to say I've never tried it as it was cheaper(not by a lot mind you) to by a 12pk of 12 oz cans. it disappeared completely from shelves after a few months here.
Someone could probably make an anime or comic about this 😂
I live in Michigan and I pretty much go back and forth between soda and pop.
I’d love to try that Teeter soda! Unfortunately I’ve never heard of Kroger or any of those other stores. Sigh.
TommyInnit is fuming right now
Ever had mountain shoutin’? I personally recommend Shasta tiki punch.
We just call it fizzy drink in NZ
i realize that harris teeter can make slogans like: matpat aproves
Here in OK, Coke or pop is the typical word used for sodas. I, on the other hand, just call them by their individual names.
I am limonaad cuz Estonia
I am fizzy tasty liquid
Here in the midwest it mostly call pop
Grew up in Texas, we say coke for every soft drink
Nice to see that Sodastream is getting talked about
COKE ZERO GANG
I think the glass bottle artisan sodas are just NOT meant to be diet lol.  I've tried Boylan's cream soda and the orange soda...both are really good! I think it's just really difficult to make a good diet soda with old-fashioned ingredients 🤔
other, fizzy drink
Nobody tell Mat about Mountain Dew, if his consumption rate holds up he's gonna devour the entire world's supply of mtn dew.
yeah im in europe so F for me i guess im stuck with the coke zero
Yay  everywhere but has a different name
D. Fizzy
Pop
Australia (I think) calls it soft drink.
Soda, pop is ok, saying it's coke makes no sense since it's the name of a specific soda
soda
food lion sodas are good but the store sucks and publix is the exact opposite
Yeah stevia is gross...
sierra mist tho
Soda sucks never liked it even when I was a kid I can't even remember the last time I drank soda its been more than 4 years for sure
Alright, so I live in Fred Meyer territory. The store generic at Fred Meyer for most things is Kroger, and the store generic soda is Kroger's "Big K". Ingredient lists for Big K Diet Cola and Harris Teeter Diet Cola are identical. I can't really confirm that they're the same thing, however.

Good job Matpat, admitting it's bad for you is the first step towards recovery
Harris Teeter soda is giving Atom from Real Steel vibes.
FIFA games be like: 4:47
15:31 we call it juice...
There’s a store I frequent quite often here in Utah (I haven’t really seen one anywhere else I’ve been) called Harmon’s that I noticed wasn’t on that list of Kroger subsidiaries.
I have a feeling that it will always come back
Always called it pop
i quit diet coke, nononono, I think you mean, *I did quit diet coke*
Matt: No one's gonna call it Coca Cola Zero Sugar. 2019 Jacksepticeye: Coca Cola Zero Sugar. Same great coke taste but with zero sugar and now with a hint of added vanila.
You SERIOUSLY NEED TO STOP DRINKING SOFT DRINKS ALL TOGETHER, because when a drink like Coke can literally clean your toilet bowl and clean the corrosion from a car battery...there’s something seriously wrong.
how is this channel not verified?
Coke zero all the way!
Diet coke with the unfair advantage, as fountain cola is consistently better across all brands. That being said, glad to see a fair assessment anyway.
When he was going up against the whole food soda and didnt like it i questioned if my taste buds are functionable XD
That finger on North Carolina pointed directly at where I live and I did a hard-core double take
Is it because that Coke chose Jacksepticeye instead of you?
Try Walmart brand barbecue chips I love them
Here, in Manitoba, some stores brands have 2 types of colas.  One is similar to coke and the other to pepsi.
When you run out of video ideas so you upload something random...
They should’ve sponsored him while they still had the chance
I've lived in both Chicago, and Louisville, and oddly enough both places say soda.
0 cal DrPepper wasnt there OOF
try diet water unhealthyass
Matt’s described Harris Teeter like it has the cocaine in it
Don’t choose soda!
"And Florida". LMAO
In New Zealand we call it fizzy
Orange soda-pop is my poison of choice.
Hate to admit it but I'm  j u i c e
WOW I think I cried during this episode! I’ve been following a similar Diet Coke obsession as MatPat and this got me emotional because I also stopped drinking Diet Coke during 2020 xD
While not Diet Coke, Kroger brand Dr. K is better than Dr. Pepper.
I remember a while back, Adam Ragusea used sodium citrate, which comes from citric acid, to improve the consistency and taste of homemade macaroni and cheese to be in line with quality of store-bought ones.  Maybe citric acid is just really good at improving foods and drinks!
3:46 uhhh the captions 💀
THEY'RE A SCROLLS
Cant you also see the nutrience facts on the back
I didn't realize Food Lion was only in NC. I also didn't realize that three of my favorite youtubers live (or lived) in NC. One of them is super nearby to me.
SODAAAA! 😲🤣🥤
i love how harris teeter is 79 cents
I live in Washington, I hate how people say pop over soda, cause I’m the only one who says soda
I am soda
I guess my family did good always buying our soda from Harris Teeter. Also - I had no idea that HT was a small company. Everyone knows about it here (VA) so I’ve always thought about it on the same level as Walmart or Kroger.
What happened to daddy pat
Steph looks so betrayed!!! And I kinda hoped it would win lol, I live for fruity stuff
Probably never heard of food Lion? Lol how else are you supposed to find the Chinese restaurants in North Carolina?
All the grocery stores you named are just Kroger with identity issues. They're all owned by the same company
up here in Canada we call all pop brands by their names
im a pop man
Unpopular opinion but diet Shasta is da best
Coke Cherry Zero from the bottle hits different
who else was cheering diet coke on? no? just me? ok...
Can I just say Dang This Man Stopped Drinking Diet Coke for a Whole Year
Stephs face when Matt stated to go against Diet Coke😅😅
I LOVE Diet coke with lime + ginger
I am quiting Pepsi for lemonade it's been ruff but way healther
My family just calls it a libation :P

"matpat quit diet coke for all of 2020" matpat during the spicy wings episode: *drinks diet coke to try and ease the spiciness*
Frys went bankrupt right before this came out lol
Paused at 23:15. In central Texas, I am not aware of a single one of these brands in our area, except for *maybe* Kroger. Thankfully, when I drink my once or twice a month diet soda, it is always. Diet Dr. Pepper. Preferably fountain. Mostly I'm a unsweetened sparkling water guy, with a tendency towards lime Topo Chico. From a glass bottle, naturally.
Yeah, I don’t care...
None of the Kroger based stores exist in my state :(.
My grandma uses stivia for her tea I love it
MatPat, are you tired of the same old soda experience? Wet your whistle with the world's first and only truly ubiquitous beverage: WATER!  NO added sugar! NO previously existing sugar! NO carbs! NO calories! No nutritional value whatsoever! Just pure thirst-quenching hydration.  Water: "It's already inside you!"™
For what I call it if I don’t use its actual name, I call it either soda or pop depending on my mood.
Olipop!
I live in Australia, it's called soft drink here
So king soopers is my local chain. I can't say for certain it is the same but I can say that their diet cola does have a fruity after taste. Like the sour from sour cherry kind of fruity.
ITS ALL COOOKKKEE!!!
im B: SODA
It's my (very possibly wrong) understanding that the flavour of cola has changed over the years from a very strong cough syrupy taste to the more modern coke taste. It is likely that Boylan's Soda is using a more traditional recipe.
Zevia made me quit so
pop
MatPat lives in NC? Sick!
Soda
I think diet soda is gross, I like normal
I am a regular coke purist. Do you have any idea how entertaining this has to be for me to watch it all?
It's soda where I'm from :D in southern California
I love Coke Zero but now I have to find that Harris Tetter one
North Carolina Represent
i love good mythical morning!
Citric Acid i've found is in everything tasty  But it's also one of the worst things you can possibly do to your teeth
i like moxie ill try the "cough syrup"
I dont even like Diet Coke, but I spent the entire time rooting for Diet Coke
Son you are going to get kidney stones
I'm fizzy drink cos I'm in Australia
I’m a A/B guy
in australia we call our soda (soft drinks)
Dang can’t get any of that... our main grocery stores are Metro, Sobeys, Loblaws, Valumart, Shoppers Drug Mart, No Frills, Food basics, Presidents Choice. So can’t get our hands on any of those smaller ones.
I’ve always called soda, fizz
Soda here (Ontario Canada)
Just went to my local Fry's and bought a 2 liter of store brand diet cola and it is actually the best diet cola I have ever had. I believe it might be the exact recipe.
B
Matpat why haven’t you done any theory’s on fortnite because it has lots of lore and you have been missing out on it
Coke Zero same original Coca Cola taste but with zero sugar
cola being called as softdrinks in my country is the universal truth
Soda
B
Anyone else thought March Madness was just some weird thing your school did for literally no reason? No, okay.
Food lion is in Tennessee
Soda
I haven’t finished the video yet, I just saw the thumb nail and was just shocked
Pop
I just picked up a 2 liter of Diet Big K, Kroger's house brand. On the ingredients it does indeed have the citric acid in it. It does have the nice little fruity taste on the back end. The 2 liter I got tasted kinda flat, but I'm sure the cans will be way better. From your description, I honestly believe this is the same diet cola you chose at the end under the a different label. It is delicious and I too like the taste better than Diet Coke, which has been my cola of choice until now.
Kroger ice tea slaps
Fanta
Haven't even watched the video but yea, it's not the best.
He 'll no
diet mr.pib
Me, who drinks water; You should just get over soda all together. As they said at the VERY start; it's not that healthy as you think. You guys really should do a theory on diet sodas as a whole, and see if it's REALLY as healthy as they claim they are.
As someone who knows multiple people who have worked in food processing factories of varying kinds including Kellogg's, your store brand non-perishable food items ARE THE SAME as your name brand. So stop overpaying for fancy packaging (especially cereals, don't do that. Buy the bagged stuff with more food for your money.) Buy store-branded foods. I remember growing up with friends who always complained about the store brand foods being of "lower quality" than other foods. And yeah, there is a taste difference due to packaging. But every time, my Dad would say he saw those two different branded foods being loaded onto pallets in the same factory to be sent to the same store for a different price. I find this also interesting when pairing this with one of the earlier theories about grocery stores. Grocery stores will place their store brands lower on the shelves for the sake of getting more interest for the name brand items. It's a thing. But I will always advocate that those foods lower on the shelves are essentially the same as the name brand foods.
Honestly, just drink sprite it beats all
General Company Foods are ALWAYS bad
THE WORLD IS ENDING YOU LOVE DIET COKE LMAO
Minnesotan here, it's pop.
* goes out to buy Harris Teeter pop *
The title of this video is terrible lmao
We all know it should be coke.
Man it’s nice to be a dr.pepper fan just watching the giant battle from a distance
I've got bad news for you: all those store brand sodas are the exact same product made by the exact same brands and equipment as the brand name sodas are. The packaging is the only difference. They are all literally the same product bottled in the same factories.
Who are you
in my experience boylins is best when surved cold. anything else and it starts tasting confusing.
what is this? i haven't seen this yet, but i do wonder what could possible bring about such tremendous changes ?
“do i say say and not what i do friends”  -matpat but also me giving advice to my friends
i have both dillons and food 4 less within 20 miles of me. i could send you some to test if you wanted to try and get a group test going mat
Last comment I swear, but this is an anime that has a tournament with that last-minute run-in
Steph looking gorgeous as ever 🙈
Ive never had diet coke cause its not available in switzerland 😅
Matt: quits Diet Coke Me: I'm sorry, W H A T
I quit when they started hating on my complexion!!
around 17:21 they may have stumbled onto a theory
Obviously pop
Sodastream was bought up a while ago, so it has actual official pepsi and pepsi max flavours now. They're pretty good, it's kinda nice to be able to measure up and decide how strong of a taste you want. They also have a few other official ones like mountain dew and 7up. Miranda is a good fanta replacement.
1. soda is bad for you 2. diet soda is even worse for you 3. You'll never see a healthy person drinking diet soda
Did Harris teeters brand just win?
Wait you live in N.C. wow i live in S.C.
And this is considered a theory
Well the Lehigh Valley is a bit of an oddball linguistically so we just call it soda.
Live kombucha cola could be a healthyish alternative

Back when I used to live in NC I began to watch your videos thinking you were somewhere in Chicago or Canada. Now that you have specified that you live in NC, it makes me feel sad that I never knew one of my favorite thinkers in the world lived only a couple hours away. Thanks for making my day.
Ever since I stumbled upon your channel I was always confused by your obsession with Diet Coke considering how terrible it is for you
You can tell this is Matt’s speciality. People always have a cheerful glint in their eye when they are speaking about something that they are truly passionate about. In Matt’s case is just so happens to be Diet cola drinks.
Tbh the fruitiness flavor will eventually get old won't it
there are food lions in North Carolina? I thought food lion was a Maryland/Virgina/DC only thing but apparently it’s more widespread then I think anyone thought lol
as a native southern Georgian, i can attest to the fact that we call all sodas coke.
MatPat needs to try the swedish Christmas soda Julmust. I think he'd like it
I have a film theory recommendation. Are the walkers of Star Wars actually more efficient than wheeled vehicles?    Edit: I think wheeled allow more speed and rotation ability. ATAT is vulnerable for all of its armor because the legs can be taken out.
YOU WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?
I feel so sad for you, that you don't get Pepsi Max in the US. (According to Google, the Pepsi Zero used to be known as Pepsi Max, but was different from the Pepsi Max across Europe that routinely beats out Diet Coke & Coke Zero in blind taste tests. If you ever get the chance to fly over, you should try it.
You missed the superior diet cola... TAB Cola!
Okay, so I absolutely LOVE the boylan bottling sodas. I super duper recommend their birch beer, cherry cola and orange cream sodas, because et hey are to DIE for. Although, I’ve always avoided diet sodas, so maybe the diet one just isn’t good compared to the others :) I would still recommend trying the sodas I listed for yourselves though!
I all
They have to be brother and sister 😂

Born and raised in FL. it's a soda
WHY ARE MOSt YOUTUBERS WHERE I LIVE (NC)
Fountain sodas have a lot of variables based on the mixture. It could be sweeter because there's more syrup and less CO2. Then if you go somewhere else, it could taste totally different because of the mixture or parts in the fountain. I'd have gone either can or bottle for this. Where's Mark Rober when you need him?
We say pop up here in Minnesota ya.
Go Zevia
In Mexico we call all the soda drinks like when we tell the waiter I want a soda we don’t say that we say give me a coke drink no soda
I grew up drinking diet coke because of my mom so I think I drink too much as well.
Diet Pepsi is still up for grabs
B:Soda  3:30 , I know I haven't probably stayed the most up to date with live stream content, but wow. Cool the house in CA was spared in the fire, I remember you guys visiting NC doing the fast food and the Pizza theory for Chucky Cheese. Nice to know you guys relocated safely to hopefully a better and less stressful location for your life and your family.
I read a great book called "Flavor: The Science of Our Most Neglected Sense" by Bob Holmes that discusses not only the pros and cons of blind taste tests, but hundreds of other factors that can weigh in to our perception of flavor. I found the book not only highly educational but deeply enjoyable, sort of like your videos!  One thing it mentions about taste testing is that the amount you drink as well as the appearance of a soda's packaging can both alter the soda's taste--and that these are both legitimate factors to consider before pronouncing a flavor verdict. For example, if you drink soda out of a yellow can, your brain will interpret your taste buds' readings differently than if you drink out of a red can. And if you drink a whole can of soda, your opinion of its flavor will be different than the opinion you obtain from a single sip.  That's why scientists using a blind taste test to determine whether unbiased people generally prefer Coca Cola or Pepsi better will almost always get the result that Pepsi tastes better--yet the same people who believe it tastes better would often rather drink a whole can of Coca Cola than a can of Pepsi. They observed that sweetness-packed Pepsi produces a potent burst of flavor that makes it shine compared to the relatively non-sweet Coca Cola, but that this burst of flavor tends to tire people's taste buds if they drink too much of it. Coca Cola tires people much more slowly, so some people enjoy drinking a whole can of it (and thus purchasing it) more than they like drinking whole cans of Pepsi.  [SPOILER WARNING] In order to truly know if you prefer Harris Teeter's Cola to Diet Coke, you would need to experience each one's taste in the circumstances and amounts in which you would normally drink soda. In a blind taste test where you sit in front of a camera, take a tiny sip, and purposefully analyze its flavor, your impression of the soda will differ from the impression you get from gradually sipping a whole glass of it while researching and typing the script of your next theory video and performing other everyday tasks. Will a flavor you preferred in a blind taste test exhaust your taste buds after a whole glass? Or will a whole glass of your preferred soda just make it even better?  Yep, that's what happens when I don't have a character limit on social media sites...
I expect the can on the game theory intro to change from Diet Coke to Harris Teeter.
watching matpat dork out bout his favorite was SOOOOOOOO ADORABLE steph is so lucky
I sadly quit Diet Coke this year. Now I’m gonna get a lot of hate but it’s because of this whole thing with them getting political. A soda company shouldn’t be getting involved in politics. Now, sadly, I think Pepsi to fill the cracks in my heart that Diet Coke left
*The Krabby Patty probably has Citric Acid in it*

Kroger brand/private selection is pretty great at everything they produce. It’s all really delicious.
This is a film theory vid FBI agent and Nooooooooooooo Diet Coke is gone :(
I call it soda
Try towne club
POP
And then there's me, drinking Colaschorle like a degenerate
Sorry to burst your bubble but Diet Coke is actually worse for you then normal Coke
I have never been asked, what kind of coke do you want. I live in Texas and whenever when I went to a restaurant, they always ask what drink do you want, and then we just say what drink we want.
coke zero is way better than diet! this is the hill I'd die on
Try Virgil's. They use stevia instead of sugar. That's better than aspartame.
Good. Diet sodas are extremely bad.
coming from texas i always say coke but there are equally the same amount of people who say soda and pop
This is what happens when you refuse to sponsor a video Diet Coke, you get bested by a store brand cola
I 100% approve "and Florida" being called out separately.  Everyone who has been to the southeast knows Florida doesn't count.
North Carolina has the best grocery stores, verified
Why does it seem fountain soda tastes better?
Someone has gotta send you the store brand from HEB, that hill country fare soda is usually my go to. It hits all the right points.    Where is RC though? Do thet not make diet RC?
idk if it's maye just because they're so close but in Virginia, we have food lions too, there's one really close to my house
C
all diet sodas are unhealthy.
There goes the Dionysus jokes...
I live in Ohio and call it Pop
I wish this video was a series instead and formatted as The Bachelorette. XD
move to bepis
Here in England it is oftsn referred to as pop, but have a Scottish friend wno refers to sodas as juice
I can’t stand diet pop of any kind. I am only addicted to all your theory channels.
Food lion?? That's Delhaize for sure, seeing that logo. Big in Belgium, pretty sure it is Belgian xD
Me, a born North Carolinian: .... Matt: "Harris Teeter and Food Lion, NC based chains, you've probably never heard of them." Me: FJWJJSJ EXCUSE ME? FOOD LION DOESN'T EXIST EVERYWHERE???
Then just drink coca cola
Diet Coke XTRA Toasted Vanilla is really good too...
Apparently YouTube doesn't want me to watch this. It's been 'loading' for the past 15 minutes
OH MY GOD PLZ DO A VIDEO ON PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS. Especially now, with so many people struggling to afford bills and food. The food industry sucks so bad.
You’ve changed 😒
I’m a soda person I say soda sometimes I say pop Sometimes too but rarely I’m too young to go Coke I wasn’t there during that time
we say soft drink in malaysia!
Soda born up north raised down south.
So in england we call it fizzy pop or just whatever it’s best known brand is for example any orange drink is Fanta and cola is coke but some people do call then all soda just cos it sounds better
15:31 *Soda-Pop*
Matt and Stef look like they could be siblings... Like, if Matt used a gender swap filter, I think he would look like her.
WHY!?
I live in New Mexico. It has always been called a coke.
I call it soda pop
see what milk brand taste good
I always say pop
nothing compares to the power of Kofola!!!  I miss Europe so much!
Finally a youtuber that lives in NC
Thumbnail: Matpat quits diet coke Thanos: Impossible
Not saying that dr. Pepper cherry is the best soda, but I haven’t found a better one
Mat your off with date new years day is in 284 days.
Why is food theory my fave if your channels
After all these years. Finally
I’ve always stuck to sprite
There are a few things I'd like to mention that I haven't heard said in the video Firstly is that Coca Cola's recipe changed in 1903 in America (when Coca Leaves,  a main ingredient, were illegalized)  and then changed again in 1985 because they found their business rival pepsi's sweeter taste was more enticing to consumers,  which was reverted in less than 3 months due to public backlash. (Also that Coke and Pepsi are surprisingly friendly as business rivals)  Secondly is the mention of sweeteners (and I intend this to be informative for any diabetics out there with me)  for the sake of your own safety,  avoid aspartame.  It may not be nearly as dangerous for you as regular sugars,  but sucralose is much safer if you're trying to maintain or lower your sugars. This goes for sugar substitutes as well,  it's safe to check and avoid aspartame. I just wanted to spread this out in case any newly diagnosed diabetics ended up reading this.  Stay safe,  friends.  Third is my question of why MatPat is so obsessed with diet cola in general.
steph looks so uncomfortable this whole video
Soda
Coca cola zero
Try Sangria senorial
POP POP POP POP
I quit coke a month ago when they came out being racist
Never expected this
Shoutout to my boi Harris Tetter.
My older fam says pop, older people of my state say coke, and my norm is soda. I like saying cola and fizz occasionally.
We call it cola in Britain so cola
It is either ‘pop’ or ‘coke’ here in Canada (or at least Southern Ontario). I think I freaked my older cousins out when I asked for coke, got more confusion when I said pop, then then they realized I meant soda.
Soda
Steph looked so shocked
boylan birch beer and creme soda are some of my favorite sodas. definitely no cough medicine flavor. i haven't tried the diet cola before
Mat Pat and Stephanie:Drinks "#2" and doesn't like it.  Also Mat Pat and Stephanie:Drinks it multiple times after.  Me:Confuse soda slurping
Dr Pepper
I saw this and thought you lost your mind like...how
As a person who's had diet vs non diet.  *You put your Allegiance into the wrong soda when you chose Diet anything. >_>*
I'm artificial sugar intolerant so I literally can't drink any of these
Coke Zero, same great coke taste, zero sugar
D
They need to send this brand out to the rest of the country
Drank
Diet Rite Cola
Say no to coke, great job quiting
Boo Coke woo Dr pepper
I think I have a name channal for the forth channal world theory
you should do a video on Hydrox (the cookie that Oreos are a knock off of)
I'm from the Midwest... I've only ever heard it called and myself called it soda. I hate the word"pop" and I hate"soda pop" more lmao.
when i heard mat was in nc like me i was like YOOOO EEPPIICC!
Coke Zero supreme
you know. i enjoy kroger brand diet cola better then most brands (coke and pepsi) it maybe worth looking into but would not be shocked in the slightest Matt if your number one choice really was Big K Diet Cola.... with a different label.
Me who used to live in South carolina so I know Harris Teeter and Food Lion: I'm four parallel universes ahead of you
2:52 And they say subscriber drops don’t happen much
Come on, MatPat...it's time to add the final piece of the theory pie (pun intended).
I grew up in WV and we had a Food Lion close to us. We love Food Lion's store brand, their juices, ice cream, soda's, etc. are really good.
welcome to TFT ASMR. Lipsmacking edition
none I am British we say the name of the drink
Finally realized it was terrible for you, huh? Good...
well, ima head to ***fredmeyers***
Diet Coke is good at soda fountains, but it’s terrible bottled.  Diet Pepsi tastes much better.
Just drink regular. The artificial sweeteners are worse for you. "Unless you're diabetic and can't have sugar it's better to bite the bullet and drink real soda." Just do drink it in moderation.
Just quit soda
my friends call me the fnaf man i feel you mat may the fnaf men unite
Get yourself some Irn Bru and never think of Diet Coke again...
Cola stevia sucks but have you tried stevia cream soda it’s so good go try it
Publix is AWESOME, though the sodas aren't the best.
Helth
In the UK we call it fizz, fizzy drinks
If you had 16 entries 8 should had played 9 seed okay when they showed the bracket it was 8 vs 9 so maybe she just misspoke.
Also, Coca-cola Life is low-key pretty amazing.
If you guys don’t say pop then you’re awfo
The sassy alibi developmentally knit because argument presumably ban toward a superb maple. dreary, voiceless step-daughter
Soda stream is nasty I would just drink normal water
The crying Duke logo lmao  I laugh because I'm actually crying for I placed a bet at the beginning of the college basketball season for Duke to win it all and their sorry asses couldn't even make it to the big dance.
Good for you! Keep you options open! It's not about the brand! Like what tastes good to you!!
In Oregon we call them "drinks"  Fountain drinks, etc.
As a Georgia man coke for sure
Dude! Why do you have a clean fade on your thumbnail but not in the video?
Holy moly, NO WAY, HE ACTUALLY DID IT-
I might be the only one who knows what team that you hinted that was left out
a good replacement is soap, it will make you last a few days though... I would not stress on finishing your bucket list before you use soap as the main drink, also they sell special types of soda soap...
Faygo, it's cheaper and doesn't cut 30 seconds off your natural lifespan for every 8 oz you drink.
Imagine drinking soda. Couldn't be me.
stephano knows her flavor , matt tongue is feeling rough after 1 year of no cola
I’m Coca Cola lol or just cola (I’m British)
B
15:29 I call it soda
Everyone: oh he quit wow  Me: *imposible*
English, I say fizzy drink, or just fizzy,   but Pop is the preferred term to soda here, side note the reason why they are called them is because they are both terms derived from... you guessed it 'pop soda, or ,Soda pop'     xD
Coke.
The filler wins, how the world suprises me not.
we are at soft beverage
Diet coke is something the world never wanted nor needed.  The correct way to do this is as follows: ⑴ Just drink regular Coca-Cola ⑵ But keep it to one small bottle (or less) per week Otherwise, just stick to good 'ol water!  See? Fixed that for you—you're welcome.
Dr Pepper zero is about to drop!
so disappointing Zevia got a bad rap in this. I switched to Zevia sodas two years ago and haven't looked back. It's a bit of an acquired taste, sure, but for how much healthier it is for you, #WorthIt. (their cream soda flavor is especially good!)
I'm soda and I live in the south. What
Matpat was Diet Coke sober
B
We had Coca Cola Life here (South Africa) for a little while and I really enjoyed it but I haven’t seen it anywhere in like two years so it must not have been very popular. I really miss it because Coke Zero is so different that it shouldn’t even share its namesake with Coke, meanwhile Coke Life actually tasted like an improvement on Coke imo.
The only 1 is Diet Coke and it’s even better with ice & Bacardi lots of Bacardi & don’t for get the Diet Coke 😎😎😎
deit bepis?
Steph: "citric acid just runs our world" Mat: "citric acid is like the magic ingredient" me being allergic to citric acid: "ya I know I have to read ingredients on everything from food to soap"
diet coke has very harmful chemicals in it so it would be better just to drink the 40 grams of sugar in a coke
this is like saying you quit heroin because you found out cocaine has a better high :///
Diet Rite is best girl. I am offended.
Just For the Taste of it.....diet Co-o-ke!!!!!
PUBLIX IS LIFE
Coke FTW
Also looking at Harris teeter it's very similar to pepsi in Canada. Idk why they remove the citric acid in the states but it doesn't help it
Crow will strike again CROHA HA CRO VHZHTHTZ KLG SHEE AOO QO WTLCROI CHQO WTLCROI XWK
That fade though
personally, i am a very big fan of the boylan.
Stevia sweetened pepsi is better than diet pepsi..
I would really like to know how you quit Diet Coke that's one habit that's hard to kick.
That Rock Paper Scissors bit is little what i want if i ever get married 🤣
rootbeeeerr
In nz we call it fizzie
I either say coke or soda usually just soda and coke if I mean coke
I stopped drinking coke too 🤣 when they were racist
I buy Kroger Diet soda all the time. I do have to say there is a different taste between the zero calorie and the diet cola version. I prefer the diet soda hubby the zero calorie. That being said I'm not sure you can compare the diet versions and zero calorie they do have a difference in taste. Love the videos food and movie theory are great!
I'd choose sam's, my family literally.lives off that stuff. We're not poor but it's cheap and one tartarus of alot better then normal come in my opinion.
**cries in Dr. Pepper**
Coke       Cane
Lords of Coke, shall we, on a spring day, crown Steph, as Queen of the bloke coke!
ESPECIALLY KIRKLARD BRAND
I mean I knew you loved diet Coke this is taking it one step far
You need to try Diet Cheerwine. It's a soft drink that is mostly known to the southern states of america.
virgin american diet coke vs CHAD non - american coke light
Cherry Coke is the best change my mind
Water?
JUPIÑA!!!
should it really be called "The Sustenance Theory"
I feel you, MatPat. I struggled to kick soda for a longtime. Switching to sparkling water is a really helpful switch. S. Pellegrino is extremely good, it’ll give you the fizz without all the junk
B: Soda
I LOVE HOW HE SAYS BOTH
Why is MA always capitalised and it’s weird maybe a new arg
a soda with a few calories is the ticket for me. Soda, diet or regular, should be a treat not a replacement for water....
*Out of all the things I thought I’d see and hear, never once did I expect such a betrayal*
Pop, that is the only name. No questions asked!
B. and I love you MatPat. <3
I know this is weird but Icall it bubbly water
ASPARTAME IS TOXIC WASTE!
Is it just me or this girl is really irritating?
Coca Cola Light?
I'm just like your rankings forgot an important factor price per oz. I drink soda and coffee in multiple liters per day so the taste really has to be there to counter a few cent turning into a fair amount over the course of a year
and KFC (Illuminati sign and music here) (17:14) update: nevermind they mentioned it
It be pop
Frankly i expect a rock, paper, scissor theory from you for that match
Im i going to give up diet coke? *limits the drinks to only diet coke*
Choose diet DP,  boo you can't take it off the table
Coke Zero represent yoooooo. Biased clap and a half for Steph Also I love random fate stuff. Good stuff.
coke
Soda
A
I’m a Michigander so it’s Pop all the way. I lived in Florida for a while and it was definitely Soda. However we went to North Carolina (beautiful!) a few times on vacation and learned that all pop is called Coke! Interesting 🤔
Steamed sugarwater is an Albany expression :DDD
#VerifyTheFoodTheoristsChannel
D: soft drink
My Favorit cola is red bull simply Cola , I don’t even like diet drinks why do I watch it
They thought it couldn’t be done
We call it Cola in my country and in brasil they call it coka
I drink Pepsi max has water so this is some place to look for maybe trying new stuff????
Try some Vimto! Very fruity and delicious!
Shocked!
As much as I hate to admit it (because I work for a Kroger based store and it's not a great work environment), but Kroger actually makes some really high quality products. I often go for their brands because they are cheaper and taste great. For instance, their Digiorno knock off is half the price and tastes nearly identical. It's $3, THREE DOLLARS for a pretty good frozen pizza that rivals the top brand.
You can still get crystal Pepsi actually
c.coke I live in south texas
As long as Coke>pepsi I don't really mind some regional brand (or even if it's available elsewhere in the US, it's not here in the NL) taking the victory (especially because it's the diet cola's and I don't drink those), but anyone who prefers pepsi over Coke is just wrong and I will die on this hill; I will however venture into trying some other smaller brands against the one and only true champion so far: Regular Coke
I think the nice looking girl would like coke life.
I lllive in Wisconsin northwoods and I called it soda but my grandpa calls it pop
Dr Pepper
I mean, SomnaSculpt’s got some Dream Die-t Soda for you.
RYAN MAGEE FROM FOOD LION
Can’t speak for the soda (since I don’t drink it) but the Ralph’s brand ice cream is AMAZING (better than most big names) and is IDENTICAL to their sister store Food 4 Less. So I would make an educated guess that they are most likely just rebranding all the same items!
Oh man cola life was best but they don’t produce it anymore and they changed the ratio of the sweeteners which make it sucks. But I really liked the first version in Austria. U know a beverage should have some cal but not zero and I really don’t like the taste of most sweeteners like acesulfan, aspertam, sorbitol however I like stevia with a bit of sugar so it’s kind of balanced
No more diet coke
Tirola cola sugarfree, Fritz cola sugarfree
#teamcoke
B
Can confirm Fry's Diet Cola in Phoenix Arizona has the same described citrus-ey undertones and is actually pretty freaking good. and at ~$0.80 for 2 liters, well... Duh
As someone born and raised in Florida, I can tell you that Steph's on the right track listing it separately from the SE USA.
This is fucking terrible
shoulda mixed them all and tried it
blue sky is a good one that you should try... idk if you can get it where you are, but it's really good
i had no idea harris teeter was just an east coast grocery store
SO disappointed you didn't go with 'Parched Matness'.
It's Pop
We call them soft drinks (not from the states)
Try water😉
Root beer
I’m disappointed you didn’t include McDonald’s Diet Coke, because they hit different!
You need to include Cheerwine in the sequel! Best soda to come out of NC!
pop
"Food lion from North Carolina which you’ve probably never heard of" It comes from Belgium and it's called "Delhaize" here. Didn't know you had those supermarkets in the US.  @Matpat: Ever tried Diet Coke from another country? You can tell the difference? Huge Coke zero drinker here and I have to say that it's always too sugary in the other countries.
I'm from New Orleans so it's either soft drink or cold drink. Lol
In South Africa Diet Coke is called Coke Light
Fun Fact:  Fountain drink are always WAY more unhealthy and sugary than their bottle/can counterparts.
honestly, same
omG
Steph sounds way to similar to Sjokz with an american accent
NOOOO
You lost me when you went fountain for diet coke, you should have done all as bottles or cans. You have to eliminate variables.
Coka cola zero, zero sugar zero taste. Diet drinks, the crappy/shitty taste you have in your mouth rest of the day, my mouth/brain say's this is not right.
We in the NorthWest call it if you are a Grandpa you call it pop if you are a kid you say soda
Normal coke is supreme
So youre saying Harris Teeter isnt teetering on the edge?
Ya no, stay off diet drinks in general
Could you do a food theory on the sugar free cookies and taste test different brands?
I'm from nc and it's always been soda,, idk what stef is talking about
Drink normal coke Diet Coke is bad for you liver and heart cause it’s artificial sugar substitute
In england, we mainly call them “fizzy drinks”. At least the places I know, we don’t say soda or anything, just “what fizzy drink do you want?”
Am I the  only one who assumed they were in LA this WHOLE time????
I now see why you married this woman LOL
How about soda pop
Growing up back in the Philippines, Pop and Coke were two different brands of soft drinks / carbonated drinks.
You should try Pepsi max
I’m really glad I’m singing along with the Food Theory theme song now. I know film and game theory intros like the back of my hand, but I wasn’t sure I was going to feel that memorable theme from food theory.
Wales here: I've always said pop but in restaurants I say coke because its easier for the waiter/waitress
You should make a book theory
That rock paper scissors competition is the reason you guys are happily married 😂😂
Coke Zero still the best
I'd be interested to see matt try Irn Bru.
WHAT
Kroger always coming out on top
If it's not available in North Carolina, then why would you want it?
I’m in England and we usually call it pop but I call it fizz and people here understand
D: other. fun fact in Russia they call soda, (any type of soda) lemonade. So since I grew up in Russia its gonna be lemonade for me
The Olympic Soda games
A
I enjoy my Diet Coke with a little lemonade in it... essentially the same reason the soda was better to you
Pop
Boylan root beer is great
Soda!!!!!!!!!!
Am Florida, we don't have any of the stores in question. Good luck everyone
Pop
soda
Soda
Over here the generic term would just be "fizzy drinks" or "soft drinks".
B
The krabby Patty secret ingredient is just citric acid
Awesome episode! Love how in-depth the research goes. By the way, Florida is not part of the South East, lol. It is the most Southern Northern State, not part of the South  : D
I call it soft drinks, my partner calls its "fizzy cordial". Were both from Australia. Im from Qld and he's from Tassie.
As someone who used to work at a food lion I can confirm their soda is pretty good.
where im from in england, we called them just 'fizzy drinks', so im an other.
23:21 I’m from the uk and I can say that the diet cola from our co-op at least from the BCP area tastes the way you’ve described it. You’re right Citrus acid does have that flair to it in colas.
How about you drink something healthier, like chocolate milk just saying cause I hate soda, I'm not a boomer
Soda fountain and glass bottle soft drinks taste better to me usually.
This video is kinda sad, it’s about a diet soda addict failing to give up his addiction and instead finding the best quality drug *coughs* best quality soda I mean
I quit soda months ago because of my gallbladder,never felt healthier
triggering my coke addiction now...
are you saying you didnt include bens farmville off road, macky amazing super hydrated no calories denzel wahsington cola, i cant think of anywhere thats not sold
so, how is this a theory?
"Yeah and Florida"
Matt   ARE YOU OK IS THIS A CRY FOR HELP
but will he remain loyal to his long time favourite  i hope not, down with coke
when you changed the title i thought it was a new vid sad) ;
RC Is  there forever
I wish Mat could’ve tasted the Diet Coke with Splenda cuz I love the regular Coke, but my mom found it with Splenda one day where I used to live in in California. My mom made me do a blind taste test between the regular Coke and the one with Splenda. I could not tell the difference at all. When she made me pick between them, I thought I chose the regular one, I didn’t. Another thing, I had my dad, who like MatPat, is also a die hard Diet Coke fan, do the same blind taste test but with Diet instead of the regular one. He couldn’t tell the difference either, and chose the Splenda one. I would’ve loved to see this cuz I wonder if the same thing would’ve happened with another die hard Diet Coke lover
Wait hold on, Food Lion still exists?! Up here in PA, they got bought out and their locations became "Shop and Saves".
Your like the internets dad
Pop is the only right way to pronounce soft drinks.
Harris Teeter after this video boutta get a baggggggg
i call everything soda, but if I'm ordering a fountain drink at a restaurant where they hand you an empty cup, I say coke
I'm a Pepsi drinker
😮
I prefer soda with real sugar (you know, high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar), as opposed to fake sugar, since I don't drink the stuff on a regular basis.
Wait I swear I was subbed to this channel what
I used to drink tons of Coke... that is until I found Real Sugar Soda from none other than Kroger. It's good stuff, real good stuff, better than name brand.
Diet Sam's is lowkey way better than normal diet coke.
Shouldn't you have chose the version of Diet Coke that matched the version you compared it against?
Have you researched correlation between diet soda drinks and diabetes?
Fizzy drink
C. ım a monster and i know it.
is this mirror mat's first cameo in a main chanel video?? nice :)
Doesn't seem like anyone cared about this segment but B. Soda - Texan.
A but converted to C
This is just revenge for them never sponsoring him.
Kroger's revenue is US$121.16 billion a year    The Coca-Cola Company's revenue is  US$37.27 billion a year  Coke is the underdog here?
In Ireland, we call it Fizzy Drinks -
Impromptu wild card ftw! \^o^/
A: Pop
It's pop lol
What I learned from this video........       Drink gallons of diet coke= Hooge brain lol (I guess diet coke makes matpat smarter)
this is one of the most 1st world things ive ever seen
I quit all soda :) Went to sparkling waters, then to iced teas. Now I just drink one iced tea per day, the rest is water. Soda is thick, syrupy, and usually burns now.
okay
my cousin lives in north Carolina
yes I can confirm Fry's and Kroger sell the same sodas and mostly other products, same with Meyer's according to some of my friends form the north eastern areas but I have not personally been there, I know the discount cards are all interchangeable. They are the same store chain, Fry's is just the western version, Kroger I thought was more south eastern, but if you guys are in NC, do you not have a Kroger?  If this is true, then it is most likely the same with Harris Teeter, they just replace those stores regionally. Otherwise, if you have a Kroger near, maybe try the Diet K soda and see if it is the same.
Harris teeter sales: STONKS
I’m soda not coke or pop
In before Harris Teeter sponsors Matt
Should’ve sponsored him when you had the chance, Diet Coke
I perfer Mt Dew code red, and sweet chili Doritos in the purple bag. I know its practicly a meme
MatPat, if you want a good substitute for soda, and not so much the cola part. Try just sparkling water with your choice of water flavor. I recommend the Walmart, Great Value brand Simply Clear, it only comes in 2 flavors easily obtainable (Strawberry Watermelon and Grape) but they are the best in my opinion. It hits that want for soda every now and then, yet maintains 0 cal, 0 sugar. It does have a whole 1g of carbs though, if that bothers you. The sweetener they use is also the sucralose, and it is good in just plain water too. I can tell you it helped me kick the sodas.
My teacher actually teached us about this the day before you posted lol
Don’t even like soda but orange Fanta in the GLASS is goated
Regular coke.
Splenda gives me MEGA heartburn.
Did he move?
@ 1:28.....Mat says " Do as I say , not as I do".....Thanku  clearly label yourself a hypocrite....one little thing Mat....Maybe all that diet soda is what is keeping you a Beta male , which may be  why you are a hypocrite...."with all due respect" man.
I love how serious he is about this
well this is it. 2021 has finally surpassed 2020
Well, just found this channel, what a joke...First things first, Anyone giving nutrition advice on  SODA DRINKS that doesn't address the reality that the soda or fiz steals Calcium from your bones when digested, and diet soda does this and even worse the sweetners used in almost all diet sodas cause cancer,  it even says so on the sweetners as a disclaimer.....Its All CLOWN FOOD, YA EVER WONDER WHY ALL FAST FOOD IS REPRESENTED BY CLOWNS AND THE SUCH.....Colon cancer doesn't even exist in the 3rd world, why? BECAUSE WESTERN FOOD IS OVER PROCESSED....STARTING AFTER WW1 TO TODAY....CLOWNS TELLING YOU TO SWITCH POISON FOR A BETTER TASTING ONE......WOW 😉
Matpat how could you this is impossible why?!!!?
A.B.C.D. I dont discriminate in words
Depends where you got the fountain drink from.  Some places use a lower 4:1 ratio of syrup to C02, but if you got it from say a Mickey D's or Wendy's they use a higher 2-2.5:1, allowing more syrup thus making them sweeter.  Places like convenience stores use lower ratios to save on cost.  Meaning, it might taste better, but it might have hidden calories because the extra sugary syrup injected into the fountain.
i thought he was gonna tell how bad diet cola is
3:46 funny closed captioning, you're welcome
We have a Food Lion right near our house!
I gave up pop a couple years ago but I have to admit that I tried a sip of the new Mountain Dew watermelon just for kicks
For the love of God Matt.... Use water to palate cleanse when doing taste tests... also you guys probably needed to finish a whole like 200ml's or so.... Small amounts will lead you to choose the sweeter brand when it might not be your choice over a larger amount as sweet can become too much for some people...
As someone who goes to Harris Teeter Regularly, I can not be more proud.
Why did he mess up the seed numbers half the time. There were two 13 seeds and two 7 seeds
Raised from Ohio to NC, loved this video for sure! Calling it “pop” is how I grew up, and my fiancé is a bit bugged by it since he’s from NC. And he calls carts buggies lol
They left out Glass Bottle Diet Coke, any soda from a glass bottle is so much better then any other type of soda
12:24 Matpat hates it with a fiery passion. Also Proceeds to drink some more.
Where I'm from a lot of people call them "soft drinks".  I assume this is in contrast to "hard drinks" which would be something with liquor/hard alcohol in it, although no one calls them hard drinks.
This won't really mean anything to anyone, but my favourite cola is pepsi max
I think he broke Steph 😂😂😂
Play zardy's maze plz
Man... When I saw these results, I was *shocked* by how *shockingly shocking* they where
Guys you know how the three channels represents a quadrant on the logo? What's gonna be the fourth one?
Imagine if he tried senku cola
The only pop I drink is Diet Coke and I’ve found that juices and stuff like V8 Splash has been a good alternative without being crazy high on unhealthy sugars
wait a second, Matpat lives in NC?
Zero is my fav 100%  But i think you can each week change each cola , also that way the flavor would not be old so you will like it more   Also I can't really put my opinion because idk what is happening in the U.S.A
B:soda
Pop!
I've never heard anyone pronounce Stevia like that. I've always heard it as (steh-V-ah) not (stee-V-ah) Also Idk where y'all have been living But Harris Teeter AND Food Lion are big chains in your northern neighbor Virginia. I have both within walking distance of my house (as well as a Walmart)
or.. someone from kroger's just tell us which stores use their cola. LoLs
Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!
check ebay for harris teeter if they're being  flipped now. LoLs
Coke Zero is basically just the same as Coca-Cola but without the aftertaste and a slightly suppressed Coca-Cola taste.
B
As a brit it is fizzy drink
It's all Coke 🤣🤣
softdrink or soda. lols
I absolutely love kroger brand sodas. Not just their cola but all of their soda. I will say their sodas taste better cold
D. Softdrink for us here in PH :3
I WAS JUST IN NORTH CAROLINA! WHAT!?
I live in NC and there’s a food lion every ten miles here, yes I’ve heard of it ;-;
Matt doing for Kroger Diet soda what ICP did for Faygo..
"I'm looking for a soda to replace diet coke in my life."  Me, an intellectual: carbonated water
I love big k, so it may be the same
This was a rollercoaster for me and it had nothing to do with soda. First thought when MatPat mentions he's in NC was, 'No way! I grew up in NC and he was there the whole time?!' Followed swiftly by, 'No, he was in LA before...'  MatPat, I can handle a Californian moving to NC if it's you (Jury's out on Steph), but you better not bring the Commifornia problems out there with you.
You guys sharing a brain during rock paper scissors is so cute <3
before watching this video i'm just gonna assume this is about the well-known fact that Diet Coke is 3 times worse than regular Coke due to the replacement sugar in it that causes cancer, which is a well-known fact EDIT: i'm disappointed in you Matthew.. not surprised, not angry, just disappointed..
Why would a young person drink diet soda anyway? Silly sot.
Pop from the Midwest
This channel exists wtf...
Where’s caffeine free Diet Coke 🥺
Pop
In Ireland we can them Minerals, don't know why...
It seems unfair to pit fountain against bottled.
A:pop
the winner was the one that was the oddball
rip
Can confirm, Boylans best soda is their orange, with root beer a close second. Whilst their diet cola is just, hot garbage.
My favorite is RC Cola
Ah yeah pop people for the win.
But why don't you just drink regular soda?
I head up to North Carolina every year, and I can confirm, Harris Teeter and Food Lion have some rockin Diet Colas.
Coke Zero was my addiction for so long
MatPat... your Midwest, actually your Ohio is seriously showing.
C: if it's brown it's coke
I gave up all soda in 2020. Still haven’t gone back- lost 25lbs..
B
We all know fountain soda is the worst choice and very inconsistent, so flawed testing from the start
I'm glad I'm not the only person who knows that fountain soda is the best version of soda. Because there's definitely a difference and fountain is 100% the top.
Haha living is SC my whole life I never knew Food Lion wasn’t a national grocery store chain 🤣 also, why did I think they lived in LA? Did they move recently or am I just crazy?
What a great ad for harris teeter
in the philippines soft drink
This defeat could've been avoided if Diet Coke had given MatPat that sponsorship when they had the chance!
I REALLY hope this has educated people on brackets and seeds a tiny bit, cause my friends don’t understand at allllll and I refuse to allow them to do our tournaments haha
In India it is juice  15:30
Pop forever
I've never tried diet Boylan but I prefer every flavor of full strength
Finally. Diet Coke is so much worse than just Coke.....
where im from we just call it either a fizzy drink, a soft drink, juice, just a drink or whatever the brand is called  so at a mcdonalds we're just asked what drink do u want, its much simpler
Clickbait. Downvoted ✅
I Really don't get the Fear around Aspartame? It's NOAEL (No-observed-adverse-effect level) is around 4000mg/kg/day and it's ADI (Advised Daily Intake) is 50mg/kg/Day. So to hit your ADI (About 0.0125% of the NOAEL), a 70kg person would would need to drink 19-20 cans a diet Soda a day (Assuming a single can had 180mg of Aspartame).  All the Fearmongering stems from a study from the 70s/80s where they gave rats and INSANE dose of Aspartame and found it negatively affected their metabolism. But that dose was something stupid like 10G/kg/Day, Using the same 70kg person example as earlier that equates to nearly 4 THOUSAND Cans of Diet coke a Day....  To Sum, you bladder would explode before you drank enough diet soda for Aspartame to have any negative affects.
As an Australian they are soft drinks. And any diet softdrink tastes like trash.
Stephanie at 20:45 : Matpat you say one more word you're a dead man
Waittt..... your telling me you chose fountain diet coke??? Like what you get from mcdonalds???
In Australia, we believe in the holy powers of *soft-drink*
Diet Coke is about the grossest crap you could ever drink. WTH
In Australia, its Cool Drink or Fizzy Drink instead of Soda or Pop.
i consistently forget Matt and Step are married
I have a diet coke addiction.. This video is making me want more diet coke :')
Just use coke zero
I know about food lion because our bilo got bought out from food lion just reasonless open awhile ago down here in Georgia
I don’t want to believe that you are swapping the signature Diet Coke
Oop! No more Coke endorsement
My favorite coke replacement is cornstarch. Preferably organic.
Dude the first time I ever watched one of mats videos he started off with a Diet Coke joke!!!!!!!🤣🤣
23:00 lol i used that background for a school project
Speaking as an ex Fred Meyer employee and a fellow diet cola addict, I can easily agree that Kroger brand cola is probably the best I've ever had
Finally
One thing to say is that you should use a palette cleanser as the taste of some things (especially tongue coating flavors) will change how things taste meaning you get one taste of A and then the taste of B becomes Bb not B. I know I am slightly picky, but I have only stumbled onto one cooking show and one cooking anime show that mentioned the flavor overwhelming effect (yet both of them did nothing about this effect saying stuff like 'well it is the privilege of the chef who finished first'). Just tossing two cents in.
-reads title- oh no the world is ending
Water.
We call it soft drink in Australia 🦘 Great video! ❤️
Never realized I was obsessed with vanilla coke until matpat, known to be diet coke obsessed, showed his ability to tell the difference between can, bottle and fountain like I could. Btw I miss my vanilla coke, I hope coke returns our more minor flavors.
I love coke zero.
Fun fact about myself I stopped drinking Sodas because affect my mood. As a man who struggles with bipolar disorder it actually helps to never drink soda again I don't know why but it just does for me.
Title: "I QUIT Diet Coke!"  Me: This theory is obviously false.
Do people actually believe that "diet" on soda labels means anyhting?
If it’s not Pepsi Max then it’s not the best, fact!
That stuff tastes disgusting
Diet coke is gross. It has a slimy taste.
other:  I call them soft drink
H2 Woah is superior
Here in Western Australia we call it "fizzy"
Make a video about the Wonka bar recipe
Stevia overpowers other flavours! Not just in soda but EVERYTHING else. Edit - My fave is still coke-zero and it being less sweet than most is one reason why.
no way i am geniuly suprised thought mat pat loved his diet coke more than cocain
Them tying in Rock Paper Scissors that many times is proof they are a compatible marriage.
wait no glass bottles? idk man imo best tasting soft drinks i've tasted wer in glass bottles.
I call it soda
“Food lion from North Carolina which you’ve probably never heard of”  Me who lives in Maryland and has 4 food lions within 10 minutes of me who thought food lion was a nationwide chain👁👄👁
You traitor! You have angered the diet coke gods! Soon mat they will strike back and give you an even more powerful addiction!
Saw this video and thought is said food terrorist's,I will now make a channel of myself just terrorizing food and basically "How to Basic-ing" it
The mention that the fountain drink was sweeter reminds me.... I hear (at least MCD fountain drinks) have more syrup in them to account for the melted ice.... While I don't fault you for not covering it in the best value soda video, I do imagine a world where you boil all the soda down to compare syrup content across restaurants.
This Video is sponsored by Harris Teeter
Im British so ill have a fizzy drink!😅
After this episode the sales of Haris Teeter diet coke skyrocketed :P
Dr. Pepper
MatPat: *tested the worst * Also MatPat: *drink the same thinf twice*  You like it or hate it??? XD
Im matpat minus the intelligence and instead of an obsession with soda its chips
We called it soda in Pennsylvania 🙂
Here in indiana, personally I switch around what I call things all the time especially Coke and any other sodas but for the most part I say pop or soda and if I really want to be fancy soft drinks
It bothers me that Matpat hasn't at least given the last quadrant of his logo a different (likely blue) color. I hope he figures something out for that channel soon
b
Nice to see he mentioned aspartame. I was always worried about Mat’s health because of the Diet Coke and that particular ingredient. I always heard nothing but bad things about aspartame.
EVERYONE PANIC
I think they should have keep it all anonymous, keeping any bias or previous knowledge out of the decision.
Hey, stop the Pepsi Zero shade! Diet Coke uses Aspartame too!
How about water or tea. Much healthier and tastes better
What is the name of the background music at 10:10?
Basically I got from this that the hostess is kinda cute. 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Here's why I like Zevia: When I first wanted to switch from Diet Coke I could easily drink 32+ oz. in one sitting. After a few days I suddenly noticed after drinking Zevia that by the end of the night I sometimes wouldn't even finish a 12 oz. can. That's a huge decline without me making any conscious effort to do so.
missed opportunity though, mat- you guys should've had some kind of palette cleaners between rounds D; that would've made a decent control for your taste buds' memory! Maybe? D;
I love boylan brand soda!
Pop or soda are acceptable. Coke is a product, not a type of drink, lul. But then again, band-aids and kleenex though... hm...
Soda gang lessgo
How tf do you have that  much willpower to last through 2020 without diet coke.
Sure just try Coke Zero  and you see no difference
I recommend you drink juice or water instead.  (Don't take this comment seriously, guys.)
Serves coke right for never sponsoring you
just drink default coke
She said Diet Coke is unhealthy. Stop propagating lies. It is nutritionally neutral and has never been scientifically shown to be unhealthy in any way.
I wonder if he always talks like he’s giving a speech
UK it's a fizzy drink
I'm a Pepsi max man myself up to the point that other fizzy drinks (apart from fanta fruit twist and monster energy) taste bad, when I buy Pepsi max I always go for 4 24pack cans. Plus Pepsi max is alot healthier
Might I recommend Cheerwine.
No   surprise Kroger is the parent company to Harris Teeter. Most of their sodas are really good.
Kroger Brand Soda's are Made With Citrus Acid ive been drinking it my Whole life to Save money and the whole time I Was shocked at how close to Krogers Brand Cola the Harris Teeter Discription was.
I'm disappointed you live in the South and didn't include Diet RC Cola or Diet Rite, 2 separate brands under the Royal Crown umbrella. REMATCH
I used to drink Coca-Cola and Pepsi, despite the Cola Wars back in the day. That is, until I tried Diet Coke. I had to give it a double take when it tasted exactly like Pepsi to me.  Lack of Cola taste, too much sweetener.
I'm in Australia, we call Coke and Pepsi "Coke" and then we've got "Lemonade" which is lemonade, solo, and that other lemon one. Then all orange drinks are Fanta, EVEN SUNKIST THEY ARE THE SAME DRINK!!!!!!!
Just drink water...
Do you -not- have glass bottle diet coke ?
POP
Water... Try it 😹
the underdog story
as a southerner, yes, represent da south
I have two Harris teeters in walks my distance of my house
Im pop
I generally prefer store brand soft drinks over the name brand ones, so I'm interested to see if any make it to the final!
My grateful thanks to whoever made the graphic of the Shaftsa can. I needed that laugh. "It kinda sucks!" could be the tag line for most off-brand Diet Soda (and some of the big guys as well), but forever it shall belong to Shaftsa.
Instead of asking people what soda/coke would they want, I’m going to start asking people what other would they like.
i think diet cola will win
The fourth quadrant should be Book Theory. #Booktheory
So the whole “pop” vs “soda” vs “coke” thing:  I grew up traveling & moving and lived in places where ppl argue about it. Overall I just call it “Sodapop” as a result
HOLY SH*T
Pop Gang
In general soft drink. Sometimes soda, but never pop.
they had it at food 4 less!
Steph: cola Mat: pop Me: FIZZY
Your making a conspiracy theory channel don’t lie
Okay, but Steph and MatPat actually not budging on their RPS choice for a few times? Adorable!
Coke
Great work! Next time a taste test like this is done, try using a pallate clenser like water in between to help prevent mixing flavors
The Zevia cola isn't that good, but I recommend trying out the Zevia cream soda.  It's their best product by far.
in the uk we call them fizzy drinks
Coke zero is the nectar of the Gods! Mmmm so good!
I'm disappointed in the lack of the rigor  They should never have found out the identity of the soda between the rounds
Food lion who you've probably never heard of.... Me who worked at food lion
I've lived in NC my whole life I can remember (moved from Michigan when I was 3 so I grew up calling it pop in the household until adult years it became soda) and have never heard a single person refer to soda as Coke as a whole. It's always been soda.
Food lion is everywhere here in middle Tennessee.
So, out of curiosity, in order to eliminate ALL possible bias, why didn’t you all make the bracket blind. Label the drinks 1-16 (not necessarily seeded either). So at the very end, you can be like: “My favorite diet cola is number 10. Which turned out to be Harris Teeter)
Great! Now can you teach me how to quit drinking 4 soda per day?
Suggestion try Refresh brand (Safe Way store brand) if they have a cola flavor... but STAY AWAY FROM THEIR CREAM SODA!!!! IT’S SO BAD!!!! 🤮
Water.
B: Soda. And I'm from Texas.
anyway before i watch this video do you think diet coke is more sweet than normal coke? i mean sweetener is more sweet than sugar itself only me? okay then...
Here in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh to be specific), people call it Pepsi. Just Pepsi. Almost anyone here will tell you it's called Pepsi until you search for specific brand or flavour. One of the reasons for this is that families here were raised with brands like Coca Cola and Pepsi. Thus remembering the name "Pepsi" and "Coca Cola" while having lunches and dinners. That's with some other brands like Miranda, Fanta, Mt Dew, etc.
drink beer
I'm from eastern Canada, and I would ask what kind of soft drink you want OR what kind of pop you want. Never "soda".
I love how the title is “I quit Diet Coke” and then the video is basically just him spending a whole day drinking Diet Coke.
Imma soft drink type guy
You better keep using diet coke memes
D: Soft Drink
Other, in Australia it's called soft drink, because it's non-alcoholic.
The Diet coke should have been bottled or canned to compete on an even playing field with the can and bottled competitors. Coke Zero has been my favorite since it came out. Pepsi of all types has always been too sweet.
Without being a creep,  can I mail you some Kroger stuff to a PO box?  I live in Nashville and I've got Kroger for days.
Glass bottle Diet Coke is sooooo good though 😍
PLEASE make an episode on how and why it's illegal to sell foods made with love. 🙏🙏🙏
I’m not surprised a possible Kroger product is taking the mantle in a food contest for a healthier alternative: I live in Indiana where Kroger’s are everywhere and they’re biggest niche is their Kroger brand products. All of them are supposed to be healthier, tastier, and cheaper than the competition especially if you have a Kroger card. They’re good, way better than a Piggly Wiggly
Food Theory is 7 months old how in the world time flies guys
And I'm sure Kroger / Teeter will be sponsoring shortly
I don't drink diet cola...And I say all three...pop, soda & coke...as I was raised in multiple states (marine brat). But your description of HT Diet Cola has me wanting to go literally across the street to Fry's for their Diet Cola just to maybe experience the description.
in Australia its called Soft Drink
i think matpat hid some audio code in the video
I had a food4less close in my town about 6 months ago I think, feels bad
All diet soda tastes disgusting imo
I have to say we rarely get to see Stef in a normal episode and she has to be one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I don't know how much of that perception is her clear intelligence and personality but on looks alone I have to say wow. You are so cute together
Wonder what Mirror Matt thought of helping them record this one....
So far it's StephabiePatrickMayerUnnaturalVegan
No On 0,25
*puts it on 0.75 speed to make MatPat sound smarter*
Thank you Another month gone deleted
Are they. Struggling to remember what are their channels about??
Have a fish
That's not your glasses .
yall know they brought back crystal pepsi
So, as a Mexican viewer, I can’t run the experiment to find the Harris soda, but I stand by Steph’s choice. Here in my house we prefer Coke Zero over any other diet soda to be honest.
Drink coffee if you want caffeine, else drink water.
Born and raises in Mexico, we mostly call them all sodas, but sometimes people calls them all cokes as well (cocas, in fact), like you’d ask for an “orange coke” or “coca de naranja” and you wouldn’t get orange flavored Coca Cola, but Fanta.
personally dont like diet soda
Not me getting a Pepsi ad before the video.
I feel so shocked and upset by this in a comedy way
MatPat: *defending harris teeter's soda* Steph: 👁👄👁
Splenda may be healthier for you, but it’ll also clear you out really quick. You’ll be in the bathroom pretty quickly after drinking.
The end portion of this video rocked my whole world the fact is that we have Smith's up here in Utah and now I have to go buy a Diet Coke to taste it thank you for telling me this and also thanks for wasting my $0.75 if it's bad have a nice day
just saying its called pop not soda
I love the way Matt describes the coke
I miss food lion from when I lived in the south. They don't have it in the north 😭 Lol I still have a membership card from over a decade ago haha 😂😭
Rhett and Link have come to the same conclusion with a lot of various Kroger products. Fascinating! They're doing something right.
I have been trained not to call soda pop because well..I'll walk you threw it Dad: hey do you want a pop? Me: yeah I would Dad: *punches me in arm* Or or or Dad: hey would you like a pop? Me: no I want a sugar water Dad: welp then you get nothing. So now I've been trained to call it soda even though I am in WV and nobody else calls it soda :(
Publix carbonated water is still some of the best carbonated water I’ve had, don’t sleep on the grocery store brands.
Was raised 3 (coke), but have gotten coke to many times when I wanted Dr. P so now I say soda.
As a former employee of kroger foods in illinois, I can ABSOLUTELY vouche that they slap different labels on similar products. I always thought big k cola had a harsh cherry like aftertaste.
sprite please sprite or mtn dew is da bes
Hey man I’m addicted to Diet Coke too. Blame my mom. I’m drinking one... like right now. I’m on my next one... help I knew the fountain one was so much better than the others
Never expected such a change from you
A lot of work, well done, but really would have liked to see all challenges as  blind, and cleanse the palate between all samplings.  Cute fun though.
Diet Coke isn't even that bad for you. low calories, no sugar, aspartame isn't nearly as dangerous as everyone used to think.
Diet bepis
I am a soda person
just drink mountain berry blast Powerade, its so much better
I'd love to drink diet sodas except I have an issue where when I consume artificial sweeteners (including stevia which isn't technically artificial) I get an upset stomach and I feel sick for the rest of the day.
If you really want to avoid bias in future brackets, you shouldn't learn the real identities until you've picked a winner! The fact that you could confidently identify your final three raised some major red flags for me in the objectivity department, lol
Anyone find any of those Kroger brands to buy Harris Teeter on Long Island, or somehow to order online? Appreciate ya!
I've gotten into drinking LA ice lately it tastes like those little coca cola lollies
Try seltzer water with pink lemonade powder
Everytime I see someone buy diet coke it's someone in a mobility scooter and they only drink it because they think it means they can have a gallon now
Soda and carts r buggies
As a North Carolinian, I appreciate the representation. Good on ya!
If you have a Winn-Dixie... Check brand drinks are really good too
Diet dew is the best
B. Soda
I think you need to try Kroger and all the other stores.
Yooooo we got a QFC in town, I'm gonna have to give their diet cola a try.
Coke Zero is where it’s at.
matpat you need to ditch the diet beverages.  If you need to drink soda, you should be drinking something that has sugar as an ingredient.  Not high fructose corn syrup, not aspartame, not stevia, not any other replacement.  All those other sweeteners make your body think you're consuming MORE sugar than you are, and causes it to release more insulin than you need.
15:29 B and D for me My grandparents called em fizzes, but both me and my mom call them sodas more often than not now a days
I DON’T care
NOOOOOOO
My favorite soda is Coke Zero. Diet Coke just never hit right for me.
We used to call it Shasta McNasta because it was so gross 🤢😝
Round 1 matchups:  8th vs 7th, 7th vs 11th, 13th vs. 3rd  what else is in that diet cola
I did not know you were in NC lol
soda
Grew up saying pop (from Indiana) until I met my ex who was from Florida and called it soda.. And so then soda kinda just stuck ever since
Imagine being so Good that you beat down a giant company.
New idea  The reason why subway footlong cost double then a six inch is no cause of the size it’s cause of the topping in a six inch u get less but in a footlong u get double of a six inch it’s like getting a drink when it’s a large it’s more cause u get more soda just like a footlong u get more topping the reason why I’m saying topping it’s a faster way of saying ur food topping anyway if ur getting a six inch with something random when u get a footlong ur getting more anyway the reason why it’s more is cause the topping cost them money even if u get a six inch if u want double meat or more topping it will cost more the reason why guacamole and other cost 1 dollar more is cause there’s more stuff in the guacamole so that’s why it cost more then the other topping anyway that’s reason why footlong cost more then six inch this idea has been in my mind all day and u might be saying it’s the size no it’s not it’s ur toppings no matter what u get its topping that’s why it might cost more than what u thought u might get a footlong that cost 10 dollar in reality the bread might cost less anyway use this idea as a vid idc heart if u like this idea anyway bye
coke mean dead to my kidney ......
A: Pop
Fountain soda is better than anything. it is superior
North Carolina pride baby, we’re the Rip Van Winkle state!!
Excuse me... Soda specialty shops? Where do I find one of these places I've needed my entire life?
Steph looks so pretty here
Yessssssssssss quit it noooooooooowwwwwwwwww
Do you call it soda, pop, coke, or something else?
soda and if it isn't dr.pepper it is unsweet tea for me
Pepsi max, there u go Look at the ingredients; 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%
Diet sodas are literally worse for you than normal sodas. The "zero calorie" sweetener wreaks havoc on you compared to normal cane sugar sodas. It also takes the definition of "empty calories" to a whole new level.
I still am annoyed by Mat being troubled about the Sans is Ness video. I think it was a good video and a valid theory.
Me: reads the tital and gets hit with years if nostalgia and realise what it means   *YOU ****ING WHAT*
If some people don’t know Publix, they are the same company as frys
Pop
Listen.... Food Lion's Omazing Orange soda is my FAVORITE orange soda. Has been for years!
I quit soa after watching NileRed turn a latex glove into grape soda. So i recommend making iced tea instead Mat
you seeded both boylan and Diet Pepsi at 7th
C then D as I got older
Fountain is way too inconsistent imo. It can be great or okay, but when it's bad.... it's real bad.
tf did I just watch
*aspartame* is really bad for you
Cold drink
Me waiting for the food theory on citric acid.
Ayeee! Publix got a shoutout!!! My store manager must be so proud. Lol also soda
is it weird to say that stef looks more and more like a real mom?
I'm a sodie pop kinda guy. The best of both worlds
Pop
Winn-Dixie brand diet coke
I once drank 8 sprites in a day but I had a limit cause I technically wasn’t supposed to have more than 1 why not go for it
I've found for almost all cola's (Diet or not) the "specialty brands" just are... to much. Either syrup or some other flavor, it seem they want to have something unique, and that thing is always to much for me. This doesn't apply to me for things like Ginger Ales, or Root Beers for example, just cokes. Store brands are just better to me overall.  BTW if any of the live near any Stewart's stores (Small Gas/Convenience Stores), All there milk based products are amazing, which they advertise, but there soda's are as well. Just putting that plug out for a small guy who makes great eats.
Yes sir shout out to Harris teeter awesome memories there
shouldnt he have used the canned diet coke cuz i assume thats what he drinks the most
As a fellow dirty coke efficiencianado, I can drink most other diet colas, except those with stevia. Yuck! I would point out that while fountain versions do have potential to be better, they usually are not. My preference is a 2 liter version. Cheap and constant. Thanks for the video!
im a fizzy drink type of person, the uk doesnt really call it by soda or pop. but it restaurants you order coke or diet and youll get whatever they have closest to it depending on the supplier like mcdonnalds is all coke brand including the fanta and things that while kfc is pepsi and tango
Diet charry coke😥😥😥😥😥😩😩😩😩
Not surprising that they didn't like Shasta. Shasta tends to have a very unpleasant aftertaste, almost as strong as Big Red, which I really don't like. Edit: If you have a Lucky's/Savemart Supermarket near you, you *might* enjoy Western Family sodas. Last time I visited one, they were still selling 2-Liters for $.89...
I honestly  still think Diet Coke is the best
i drink coke zero a lot i really like it , and i started drinking it because i just found it tasted better than regular coke so i kinda hope it wins
what id 2020 was just his withdrawal symptoms of diet coke
Nah, Boylan Root Beer tastes bad too. I'm not suprised.
He went all of 2020 with Diet Coke? How did he survive Quarantine
fizzy drink
I'm actually other my family has a rather large amount of diabetes even though they are healthy Hispanics. We call soda(I call soda even though I was raised in Atlanta georgia home of coca cola) we call it veneno which means venom in Spanish meaning 2 things, they know it's bad for them but they drink it and it's also an inside joke cause veneno is used as a term for alchohol as well
Matt: are you pop, soda, coke or other? Aussies: well we're all softies so gonna have to go with other we call carbonated drinks soft drinks here. When you rock paper scissors instead of letting the cameraman break the tie. Scientific method at its finest.
Lime Pepsi is better!
Fountain is easily the best because its the freshest one while the plastic bottle and can are built for retail to sit on shelves for long periods of time. Fountain is constantly changed since people who work in the food industry have to clean out the soda fountain daily and refill the drinks.
It's all coke. -Indiana
Underdog thing. Harris Teeter.
You guys are my favorite couple
Can we please make a theory about how matpat hasn’t been ageing?! Like the heck!?
I'm Soda
dear viewers, do not drink from the same straw if one of you has covid-19, plz be advised even after you get the vaccine and the other didn't.
I just realized that people could take the information from this video and find his house. I mean half the people who watch this are curious minded anyway.
I live in Florida and I genuinely think Publix soda is the best
lets start theorizing shall we? he needed a substitute cola that as he on multiple occasions has claimed needs to be sustainable so if his local store decides to sponsor his dirt cola addiction he might give it a favorable review if they give him like a tanker filled with cola he also said that store brand was cheaper
We have food lion in Georgia so not just NC
Personally I’m addicted to caffeine so I just call it that caffeine
I KNEW it was going to end up being Kroger. I live near Cincinnati which is where Kroger manufactures a lot of their products. My family has preferred Kroger products over most name brands for generations AND if you ever check out a blind taste test on Good Mythical Morning, if Kroger is in the mix, it's almost always going to win.  I have to say, I'm proud of Kroger lol
Can't wait to drink a diet coke while watching MatPat break down Security Breach
Do a vid of mozzarella sticcs
Diet Coke? GTFO its Coke zero or nothing
POP
I like zero sugar coca cola
hey matpat, can you do a game theory on league of legends new incoming MMORPG game of league of legends development?
Rules #1. Soda has to be cola flavor. #2. 0 calories #3. Has to be available
15:29 Pop.   Also, does anyone else balence soda cans on the bottom edge when the can is aboot 1/3 's empty?
Finally no  diet coke dad jokes
No calories no problem!
I’ve been drinking diet soda for a year straight and I lost 50 pounds 👍
D;
Down in Australia we call it fizzy drink / soft drink.
WHO WANTS TO GET CLOSER TO JESUS. JESUS+STRUGGLING+REPENTANCE+SUFFERING+MOOD CHANGES+EVIL LEAVING=HEAVEN COMMENT IF YES AND Y WON'T JUDGE JESUS #SAVED
3:46 😏
100% coke first, then you choose the type
B: Soda
THIS ISN'T EVEN A FOOD THOERY BRUH XD
Harris Teeeeeeeeteeerrrrrr!!!!!!!
I’m a B: Soda ( In Connecticut )
Container/source absolutely alters the flavor of a soda.  I can tell the difference between canned, bottled, and fountain sodas easily.  My favorite container is canned, followed closely by fountain.  I dislike the plasticy taste of bottled sodas.  To answer your question:  it was pop when I was a kid, and I call it soda now.  Born and raised here in Indiana.
Bruh my local grocery store *is* Walmart
first time seeing one of your reviews  but I'm a Coke fanatic so I watched this and I have a couple thoughts: 1) your wife is gorgeous 2) I'm Canadian so it's pop 3) I too want to love stevia because I'd like to reduce my calorie intake but it's disgusting in everything I've tried 4) please do a cola tasting of regular colas if you are able
get diet coke with lime everywhere its great
I’m in the midwest and our state calls is soda
Me who lives in Florida: 😂🤣😂
its true they call soda pop in the northern pop and i know this bc im an iowain
Lol this is like a GMM episode but instead of 2 middle aged men it’s a nerd and his wife...
we call it "Soft Drink" here in Aus
because my parents are from up north and I grew up down in the south I call it soda-pop mixing the two together
About the south thing, you can also say, "what kind of soda do you want," technically.  Notice how it doesn't sound right, unless you speak Spanish, so coke is used almost always.
Pure poison
My jaw dropped when I read the title-
he literally just reviewed soda
Lemon Snapple i don’t care if it isn’t a soda
Originaly would call it pop but after moving around i prefer to call it soda
Coke café. It's my favorite. They have espresso, caramel, and vanilla. It tastes amazing.
The boylans cola's aren't great but their root beer and their cream soda is just elite
Pop
20:54 surprised pikachu face
surprisingly, i prefer Ikea cola to Coca-Cola
diet pepsi
where i live i call it fizzy and limon fizz is called pop
Pop: X Soda: X Soda-Pop: ✓
Wack
Can you do a episode on which artificial sweetener is actually the safest/healthiest
I grew up saying Soda Water
The flat nitrogen macropharmacologically bat because whip compatibly squeal across a early shell. protective, classy flute
But that’s just a theory
I prefer Pepsi, Pepsi zero though I  wish it didn't have aspartame in it, as it affected my emotions etc. I actually dont mind stevia drinks. I might  have to try that other option you said for Pepsi if they sell it in Canada.
He immediately switched to crank lite. He has yet to get out of court ordered rehab.
Citric acid just became a meme
Coke.  It's all Coke.
people  i know say soda but i just say the name of it
I uh... don't live in North Carolina but have been in a food lion a lot. I go to North Carolina to see family each summer.
The walk on won... Who woulda thought?
We don’t talk about great value soda 🧍
Soda
I gess that woman only watches ur fnaf theory’s hey that’s like me müåhæhä
Mathew I thought he’s name is Matt
Ye becuase the suger they use is fake so they can technically say is has 0 sugar
Every time i hear him referred to as Mattpat I always think Matthew Patthew
D: Fizzy down under
I grew up with Kroger being the convenient grocery store and I feel like I can say this honestly: Kroger brand foods are just good.  Also, I remember Food Lion when I was stationed in Virginia. We called it Ghetto Cat. But we were crass sailors who literally didn't care about offending anyone.
Alternative Tittle: Diet Coke might lose their chance to sponsor MatPat
It's a lot healthier to just /not/ drink soda though...
D. I'm British so when I go anywhere and they ask "do you want a drink" I just say Dr pepper
I wish they had a food lion in FL I’ve only been to one in North Carolina when I went to see the snow for the first time
As a prior kroger employee,  we are taught that all of the stores you mentioned ARE just other names for kroger. They have all the same suppliers and employees, and kroger employees often move horizontally through these differently named stores.
I live in Georgia and I was born in Georgia but I always call it soda I've never called a pop or coke coke is it specific brand to a pop is well what a bubble makes and then again I'm very Northern for a georgia-born person I don't really have an accent and I don't really have slang terms that we use in the south I speak very formally
I dislike cola. Diet or otherwise. However I liked this video.
I know about food Lion I live in Georgia so I'm really not that far from you guys Southeast people yay
Lived in the south for most of my life, and call it soda or pop. People calling the whole category “coke” makes my head hurt.
I love soda my favourite kind of soda does Coca-Cola
i never knew food lion by it's name, just by logo. I would go with my grandmother YEARS ago.
Only Like it becuase which one wins. Who says cliches cant be good?
While Diet Rite may go back a bit, it is NOT the first diet soda. The first was supposedly available back at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.
Never tried Boylan cola, but their root beer is hands down is best root beer I’ve tried
Sprite...sierra mist?....a non-caffine, non corn syrup. no carmal color...
stephs hot
I gave up my Diet Coke addiction by switching to.. BEER!   I've been very happy ever since.
Fanta better
14:38 wait is food lion only around North Carolina
but Diet Coke also uses aspartame...
I'm from Minnesota so pop
C & D -sometimes it's cola. But then, I'm in North Carolina, and have a family member that works at HT, lol.  And store brand can be a life saver.
Shout out to all the people out there who named their dogs Shasta i cant be the only one right?
Being an okie. Its coke all day
I'm from Michigan, and its Pop up here
Let’s be honest we were all rooting for Harris teeter
I never knew that my afternoon would be spent rooting for an underdog soda that I I don’t even like for someone else to drink it
Mat my parents are coca cola veterans just like you so your not the only diet coke obscenest person
not to be that guy but doesn't diet stuff cause canser
Cold drink for us here in Pakistan
Over the Lippeth, Through the Gummeth, look out stomach here it cometh.
D: Fizzy drink
The problem with most diet sodas, for me, is the aspartame. The taste and how they sit in the belly are what make them worse than standard, full calorie sodas or even the aspartame free diets. Of the major brand Diet Colas- #1 Diet Pepsi Aspartame Free (sadly cancelled). #2 Diet Rite. #3 Coke Zero (surprisingly with aspartame) Down at the bottom is Diet Coke and even worse... Diet Coke 'Feisty Cherry'. Drinking THAT is how I imagine drinking battery acid or Drano would be.
If you taste the stevia you have too much stevia. People have a hard time believing how strong it is, so they think they must add more for no other reason than "it can't be _that_ much sweeter!"  You also need an actual underlying flavor to sweeten. Stevia isn't really suitable for more subtly flavored drinks, at least to the American tongue, where sweetness _is_ a flavor, and often a peer flavor...insofar as sweetened could be called a flavor. (It's not...except in the US.)  The upshot is that stevia is hard to properly use in the US thanks to the American sweetness bug. When you're sweetening ketchup and mustard ffs it's a problem. Not to mention, did you know Subway is a pastry shop? Oh, wait, you covered that.
traditionally i call it soda, but also pop sometimes, depends on the type, like if it is big brand name, or specialty or unique, know what i mean?
Diet rite zero
You need to do a video on wether diet sodas are actually more healthy
I feel like this point diet coke is the mascot of food theory
down in Texas it’s allllll coke
Food Lion used to be King Kullen, right?
Where I live. A child would call soda.. pop, an adult says soda
A
theres a problem fountain is not readily available unless ur going too maccas everyday bottle should be the choice. The other problem is if they are not cold they can taste very different.
North Carolina native here. Pleased to see Harris Teeter and Food Lion represented in the bracket! While I tend to say soda, I normally call whatever soda I want by its name. I’ll say “I’ll have a sprite,” or “I’d like some ginger ale.”
it’s called soda here. B is my answer
Whattttttttttttttt
So this is why your son is blonde? Because deep inside your wife was a smiling titan all along? Understood. Everyone will know about that...
Surely a better test would have been to compare them all from the same sources of bottle vs bottle or can vs can.
Stephanie is such a pretty little liar...
Stephanie, an eye, for your entire face
I can and can't believe the outcome.. Kroger of all the places to exist Kroger won I work for this corporation and dam  I guess they got good Cola.
So much deception
1? 2? No no
Stephanie would look good with short blonde hair...
I love cheerwine, it's a great soda. It's basically just cherry flavored cola. I hear it's an only southern state soft drink. I never knew.
Over in Illinois, we have RC Cola, or Royal Crown Cola. I'm personally not a fan of most 'cola' drinks, but if you could get your hands on it, you could give it a try if that have diet.
It's sort of funny to me, that they were just so against the Boylan and Johnny Ryans, because of the tastes when I can't stand most sodas like pepsi and cokes because they just taste sugary and artificial. I do love Boylan. It a nice treat. Also I worked for a Kroger once, they are the same soda just with different labels.
Anyone that drinks diet drinks is such an idiot beyond recognition We all know that "suger not good" but it seems like NOBODY knows that synthetic sugar is much worst! I meam which one's worse: Diabetes or cancer?!
Interesting
I listen to this while getting buggies for work at Kroger
I will try this. I have a kroger here.
Pepsi Max is still better  And Fanta is better than that.
I qUiT dIeT cOkE. Who cares. How about post something important like the 60,000 homeless in LA. 60,000!!
There is a Brazilian soda called "Jesus", it is owned by Coca-Cola and its pretty good.
Ski soda is the only soda

But he didn't even take a moment to consider than perhaps a non-diet soda would be better.

For a hot sec I thought he was quitting YouTube and o was like “ B*** why the flip are you qu- wait......”
I work for a company that produces vitamins and supplements. We have several private label customers. The bulk (capsules, tablets, or softgels) is the same in the different bottles. We just change the bottle colour or shape and put a different label on. Costco, Shoppers Drug Mart, London Drugs, Walmart, Rexall, Safeway, and Loblaw's brands all sell the same vitamins with different labels.
If I’ve learned anything from Good Mythical Morning, it’s that Kroger dominates when it comes to their private label.
I'm B and C
A.  Definitely a pop speaker.
she always is, but stephanie looks so pretty in this ep

I'm from Louisiana and we call them all "soft drinks"
A. As a Wisconsin resident I call it pop sometimes along with soda. But pop is considered the most common term.
D: Other, I grew up with cousins that called it soda pop. Hah.
Glass and plastic cola tastes different
You drank Diet Coke
challenge count how many times mat says diet coke
The title should be food theory: I became a man
Interestingly enough, here in my country Brazil, or at least in my city, Coke Zero is wildly more popular than any other Coca Cola variant (with the exception of common coke).  But the best one for me always was Pepsi Twist Light (with lemon), for some reason it was a lot better than any soda ever. Great flavor balance.
in egypt its like " what kind of pepsi do you want?"" ""i want 7up"
Zevia is above and beyond my favorite out of all of those, drink it pretty much everyday
"Uh, I will have an other with my food tonight."
Diet cocaine is the best coke!
Soda  Edit: I’m literally the only one that says soda (including my family) where I live 😂

Kroger (Pick N Save) has a cola flavored seltzer water. Worth a try!
Here is a good soda to replace your diet coke Diet diet coke
Here in the UK most people call it a fizzy drink, or younger people would say soda
That's great diet coke causes heart attacks so I'm very very glad you dont drink it anymore I've been so so worried since I started watching
Bro they forgot my favourite, Coke Ain
It's definitely "soda."  Even in the South.
He looks old in the thumbnail sigh aging sucks hurry up technology save our consciousness.
Ok the Rock Paper Scissors battle proves there soulmates
We actually had Food Lion's in Maryland when I was growing up so I HAVE in fact heard of them!
I'm Pop, my SO is Coke.
Turns out Kroger Diet Cola is my dad's favorite cola and is often sold out at our local Fred Meyer.
I use to always pick up cherry or raspberry flavored sodas when I could get them since they were my favorite. Then I went to a smaller convince store around high school every Friday, on my way home, for snacks but they never had cherry or raspberry flavored stuff so I tried out different sodas and found out I really liked Dr. Pepper (turns out some of the 23 flavors are raspberry and cherry). Then I started to notice how much Dr Pepper was($3 a 2L bottle in my town) and decided to try some of the supermarket brands of Dr Pepper knock offs. I will say, I have tried Walmart, Safeway, and Fred Meyer Dr. Whatevers and I like Fred Meyers more, and the best thing is that the 2L bottles are around 85 cents vs walmart's 95 cents and Safeway's $1.25.
"and this one is like- thE OthEr OnE"
Live in tn... but I call it soda.
I'm just going to say that my mother and I think Diet Right is the only actually good cola but can no longer aquire it in our location in NC
Thank the non-existant gods that Jeff and Amazon are here bancrupting convential grocery stores and soon his best pick will soon again be under the Coca Cola brand. BTW Steff is right, Coke ZERO is best.
Is Pepsi ok?
Pepsi was born in North Carolina.  Could it be they sell some off brand options to NC based groceries?
Diet Dr.Pepper is terrible. You're not missing out on much
I left shortly (well after writing this) after seeing what is excluded since after quitting drinking regular sodas the only diet variant i could drink (and only ice-cold) was Pepsi Max Cherry Zero, so i don't care for the rest.
Nothing can beat coke
matpat what have you done  this is the soda version of game reviewers talking about fangames and romhacks  now the big companies are gonna be like "oh, we can't have that"
Food lion is a Dutch owned store
How is this video a theory  WTF?
I went to the Florida Natural's orange juice factory. They also bottle Publix brand orange juice.  The better graded oranges go into the Florida Natural's brand, but during peak orange season, they are essentially the same.
As someone from east Tennessee food lion is here as well and their store brand diet mountain lion is better then mountain dew.
Why not give out its ingredients table?
Store brands can be extremely legitimate but when they go wrong, boy can they go wrong.   Thanks for the vid!  And I hope anyone coming across this is having a good day and if not is holding up okay.
Coca Cola
“It’s a little unhealthy”  Key word “little”
Skip cola go straight for Moxie. Sincerely a Mainer.
Coke come on
Australian so Soft drink/ Fizzy

Diet Pepsi Caffeine Free all day
Wha.... what...?
Always thought that Coke was alright, diet Coke is meh, and Coke Zero was gross
Drink spindrift !!!!
This comment was made by Pepsi gang.
Thumbnail response: Uninterested. Just clickbait
Food Lion is from Ahold delhaize. It is a very big company (€25,69B)
mine is drank
Would the citric acid not disqualify Harris Teeter? is it not like a Pepsi Twist in its own way?
I wonder what they did after to burn off the calories after...
Btw I think they still make the cristal Pepsi or something cuz not to long ago I found a bottle of it I thought it was something new cuz I never heard of it before
I've been so happy to see Publix be mentioned I love Publix I was literally just there like 20 minutes ago
They should of done rock papers scissors lizard spok
D: Other. I'm Dutch, so it's "frisdrank" or "fris" for me.
Fresca
"I am looking for a sod..." Water, Matt, water is the answer.
I'm team D) other: I live in Argentina and we call sparkling drinks "Gaseosa" (gassy lol) unless it's sparkling water, then we call it soda
Is Moxie not available there then?
D: Other - in glasgow all fizzy drinks can be called as ginger
Boylan's actual soda is great. Maybe the sweetener was bad?
8:14  MatPat and Steph: *says that #2 is terrible* also MatPat and Steph:*continues to drink #2*
Caffeine-free?? No. No, no, no, no, no! NO.
D: Other In Louisiana we say Cold Drink
Choosing the sweetest diet coke just sounds like the Pepsi challenge. People like sweet stuff on a single taste, but not over time
Believe ALL Diet Dark Colas Contain Creosote,Same Thing Telephone Poles are treated With to Keep them from Rotting too soon.Drink Up Kids!!!
Anyone else miss the super amazing end card tournament
Im b: Soda
mamawa
Coke Zero is one of the only “diet” colas I can stomach. The rest taste like they have an aspirin or 50 crushed up in them.
Ok but try Moxie poured over ice
This is the episode that is the sole reason Matpat started this channel
Short answer: Matt Patt has been allied with the wrong type soda period. Long Answer: If you choose to go down the nutritionists rabbit hole you'll find that Diet branded anything isn't actually a good idea for people period but if you go deeper into the Rabbit hole things get very dark with a bright outcome at the end theoretically if the science is actually correct and not misrepresented to sell poisonous foods to unsuspecting victims.
This is a disgrace delete your channel
I’m a pop
Didn't know they had a 3rd channel.
The problem with diet coke here, is tjat ir leaves an after taste on the mouth.
Get better faces
I say I'm getting a can of "pop", and recognize the machines in fast food places as "soda fountains". The drink itself is "soda pop" to me, but I will frequently (or at least, as frequently as I actually talk about it) shorten it to just "pop", possibly because we only get it in cans at my house (other than root beer for floats, which I call root beer, because I just don't think of it as a soda pop, it's beer without alcohol... and it's actually good).
These sim and simp are up to something
Pepsi Max is very good
This is not a food theory
Look like morgs
Why do I like this more than the actual March madness
Zero sugar A&W Root Beer FTW!
diet pepsi 😍
Matt! Moxie is the best soda
Alternate title: Mat and Steph drink soda for 20 minutes
No one gives a crap about your poor drink
For New England fans Food Lion = Hannaford
JUST DRINK FRICKING SPRITE
Pop is the only correct way to say it
im actuallt a big zevia fan
18:17 Would have been easier with a coin toss: Heads for 1 and Tails for 2.
Can anyone tell me if they actually knew what Food Lion is? Or is it just something we Carolina States know?
NO COKE IS BETTER!
I call it a soft drink
I want to see him get the Fallout 4 cook book and make Nuka Cola and give his impression of that.
The Coke Zero betreyal nooooooooooooo...
It might just be because i'm in another country but we call them Soft Drinks or Minerals
Pop
Coke 0 is better
If your from nc just drink sun drop you are immune from the negative effects
Soda, lol.  Grew up in Virginia.
Never expected such a change from you. I like it
we say "frisdrank"
Idk about NYC but in upstate we say soda or coke. It really depends.

I'm a soda boy...
stef needs A MAJOR NOSE JAB AMM I RIGHT SHE COULD POKE AN EYE OUT
If you ever get to Mexico and try "Coca Light" you're gonna FLIP!!
Probably never heard of Food Lion??? Are you telling me that people in the Western USA don't get bombarded with Food Lion commercials every 5 minutes?... Lucky you... 😂
Pepsi mqax is the best soda in the world

Today in the news: The Diet Coke guy doesn't love Diet Coke as much as other sodas anymore
i like diet water more
Soda or soft drink cause kids ain’t getting hard apple juice :)
please please do a violet Beauregard episode i cant wait o greastest theorist on YouTube
My man claims to be from ohio, but he calls it soda... smh...
I don't drink anything other than water, and occasionally some juice if it's fresh and with no sugar. Not because I'm against that or anything, in fact, I have a bit of a sweet tooth. It is mainly out of spite. TO add some context, in my teens I used to be the type of guy who would buy a 2L coca-cola to drink by himself in a day. So one day when I was 17 my family and I went out to eat, but last night I saw one of those videos about how sodas are bad and all, I remember it cause it had a song by Jason Mraz and all, it was called the real bears. So while ordering I tell my family I don't want a soda, and later when my sister couldn't finish hers she tries to give it to me, but I say I'm gonna stop drinking sodas. Now they knew that I love them so they simply laughed and laughed.   And out of the sheer desire to prove them wrong, I stopped and months later they realized. Now its been 8 years and I still shove it in their faces, even though they are happy for me for trying to be healthier.
The thumbnail had me scared u were quitting YouTube
All diet drinks are disgusting
C. Also when we go to a restaurant and they ask what coke you want we ask if they have Coke or Pepsi products.
I live in the south we call it Coke soda and pop all three of those will use all of them
we here in India call it cold-drinks or 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘢 thats hindi for literally the word "cold"
Me: *Coke is coke*
Water
as someone who is working a grocery store I can just outright tell you sometimes the store brand is made in the same factory as the name brands when it comes to food.  When that happens it's usually a good choice to go with the store brand as it's a bit cheaper and will usually give you the flavor you want.
As a person from Arizona I can it a drink or soda sometimes I say carbonated beverage
I'm growing up with pop and soda
B: Soda, That's what I prefer to call it
Diet coke mixes too well to stray...
7Up free. Hands down best tasting diet soda
I used to be where you live but i moved
When is the road trip?
Aspartame go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Cola flavor is supost to be strong and was medicinally used when it was invented also cola flavor comes from the root of a plant if you did not know
Apparently Coke suspended production of their Diet Coke with Splenda for the time being; it's not technically "discontinued", but still, you're just not going to find it in stores. https://twitter.com/CocaCola/status/1324714978981617664
Can someone tell me what brand soda is the same as the winner?
Fresca, coke zero, or diet DP.
Yo no one cares
I was wondering why there wasn’t a Kroger brand diet soda😂 but never mind
Sorry, Matpat, you've been completely wrong the entire time. The TRUE supreme best soda you should be drinking is the original Barq's Root Beer. Diet anything is garbage. =^x^=
Fun fact: if a product says "manufactured for" or "distributed by," then it's a private label product.  This is required by law in the United States. (Not sure about other countries.)
I’m from California, I grew up calling it soda
i'm in the south so it's all coke, but I also use soda. No one here uses pop
Pop / coke
Steff + an + I := Sreffani  :P
100% coke as the catch all for carbonated beverages
Fountain soda should only be compared to other fountain cola. Seriously, limit your variables. Since you identified in the opening that can v plastic v fountain of the same drink tastes significantly differ in taste then your bracket is rigged. I call for a proper redo
What happened here
What your name is Matthew
I want to try it out
I never cared for diet sodas, they all taste off to me. I do like the cane sugar-sweetened Coke Cola, but I cut back on sodas a long time ago.  Mat just needs a commercial fountain machine at home. Having lived in several regions in the US, I can float between what ever is used, pop, soda or coke.
15:31 *B*
Definitely a "Soda" person. I would like to try some of that Harris Teeter regular soda.
I never thought that this day would come
Diet Moxie because you can’t be a theorist if you don’t have Moxie
I think throwing in the fountain diet coke is a bit unfair, versus bottles and cans.
But Grapico!
It’s called SODA!
Ope it’s pop there bud, up north here we call it pop.
Replace it with alcohol, boom. Easy fix
I'm suprised
Have you tried the Coke Zero flavors? I also used to be a major Diet Coke addict, years ago. These days I'd really RATHER have the diet coke with Splenda, given any choice, but that's so hard to find. So I've started drinking the flavored coke zeroes. Cherry vanilla is my favorite. My wife's fave is orange vanilla. I also like the vanilla flavor a lot. These wouldn't have been in your competition because they're not plain cola flavor, but you should totally give them a try.
Stephanie looks gorgeous!
The end of an era
I wish I could try the Harris cola.
It shows that you have never tasted Mexican Coca-Cola and it shows Mexican Coca-Cola is the best coke they have not changed the recipe over there so it's so much better that they started importing them
B
What about rc
I love being from N.C and knowing all those grocery chains, its nice to get some representation from Food Lion and Harris Teeter
Bruh I don't understand what in the world he says but I still like it
As a fellow North Carolinian, I am immensely pleased that the local stores did as well as they did. A bit sad that Food Lion only lasted one round, but it was going up against the eventual champion so how mad can I be, really?
water..
Well now next time I drive north I’ll have to stop for some Harris teeter on my way through
Y'all who choose anything other than B have something wrong with ya
5:43 Ok, I have a problem already. I have never had a good soda from a soda fountain, they always taste watery or tinny. I like bottles the best, but find cans more cost effective. Who hasn't heard of Food Lion? My family has bought groceries there for decades. I say "Soda" I live in SC but I was raised mostly in Va. and West Va. and a little NC.
Don't forget, artificial sweetener in diet coke, zero etc, actually makes your brain swell, resulting in migraines/headaches becoming more prominent. That is if you drink 0.5litres (or 0.13 gallons) per day.
in the uk we mainly call them fizzy drinks.
Matpat you should do a video on food theory about Dr Stones stone world foods and cola.
Mattpat should stop drinking that diet filth. It'll harden your liver like no other.   Go to Dr. Pepper. That's the best soda
I like blue sky rootbeer. But its expensive.
He lives in NC?!
Boylan root beer is sooooooo good
So you have coke and myrtle Beach awesome
Isint diet soda in general bad for you?
This is were men cried  May diet coke rest in peace
In the UK, we just call everything what it's called like it's not "soda" it's just Fanta, or coke, or Pepsi or what have u.
I'm from the south. C
I’m a “pop” person that’s what we call it where I live
No bec cola Try that thing you will need to import it from quebec
doing science for all of us!!!  the result: dont drink diet soda
𝑰 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒏'𝒕 𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒅 𝒅𝒊𝒆𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒌𝒆
Eversweet is a great Stevia sweetener...honestly feels like Stevia done right.  Basically, imagine pure sweetness without any weird aftertaste.  Super clean and it's environmentally friendly.  Also, Citric Acid is an amazing ingredient.  It does so much, so food science (chemistry) becomes very interesting with it.
I'm more of a "Pepsi" guy 🤷
Watching this episode hurt my teeth.
Pepsi Zero is my FAVORITE. I'm actually excited to try Diet Rite if it tastes so similar
You just upended the soda market... I want some...
Coke, that's all I've ever heard sodas called.
what are the seeds?
Diet coke sucks, I am glad to hear.
Ok I know that this might not be the best idea but can you do the best chewing gum? Like by category of how long the flavor lasts, the size of the bubble, and the freshness of the gum or something like that. maybe throwing in a few facts on how gum can actually help you concentrate and remember things that you've studied while you were chewing it. just a thought I know you probably won't see this but I thought it was a good idea. I love your videos and all of your channels. Keep doing what you're doing we love you
Welp he is trying to get the soul stone
Food lions diet coke is awesome
I'm on Keto, Zevia was a very important part of my cold-turkey efforts to give up sugar-water drinks. I am forever indebted to Zevia.  Frankly, the cream soda Zevia flavor is better.  I've since moved on to just drinking carbonated water though, which is much healthier.
In Denmark, we call it "sodavand" which directly translates to sodawater.
Dr. Pepper #1
Enjoyed the episode, but I kind of hope you revisit it when you starting drinking regularly again. And see if you stick to it, do you like it more in short term because it different or actually like it more in long term. A lot of food and drink are great in small bit, but once you eat regularly it easy to get sick of some of them.
#SPRITE
Hey Matt Pat there’s diet Pepsi diet Sprite I don’t know others:( ps: Sprite is part of Coca-Cola cool?
IMPOSSIBLE... Matthew Patrick giving up diet coke, no way
I may live in NC but I had no idea that Food Lion and Harris Teeter weren't all over the US
Pop
about sucralose: it technically is a sugar, just one our body cannot use
Why am I watching this? I don’t even drink soda let alone live in South Carolina???
This but it’s a FNAF theory championship
So Cheerwine is out of the test.
Matt just sounds like he talking about a theory no matter the topic
"Food lion you probably never heard of"  Me: I get there colas every week at the grocery store and it's pretty good
might i suggest... water
cold drink in india
YESSSSS HARRIS TEETER CINDERELLA STORY!!!!!!
Soda, that one area of NC that says Soda
i wanted Haris Teeter to win so hard, and it got so far lmao
whelp, guess the world is ending.
Kroger store brand anything is historically good. Watch literally any blind taste test on GMM. I actually buy store brand at Kroger because it's sometimes better than some name brands
grew up in michigan. i'm a pop person. i'm also a pepsi person. also not a diet person >.<;;
Why am I just knowing this now? About this channel
You are doing this in an incredibly bad way. Yes keep the brackets, but you should not know what cola is in each bracket. That allows for bias and expectations.  The judge needs to be blind for each bracket.
Other: Cola but we still say coke
Soda
Western soda in inherently evil.
Hey Matpat,  I didn't know you were in North Carolina! You need to try Cheerwine! It has a diet variant as well, but the original is soooo good.
Here in brazil, i dont know if there is in another place, there is a variant of pepsi that its pepsi with a tint of lemon  it super good for me and my family it s the best soda out there
A&W root beer?
I'm a soda kind of guy
The 4th theory channel should be: conspiracy theories
It all comes back to added citrus, it’s like a hidden conspiracy across all of food theory
7:05 Shouldn't it be 8th seed vs 9th seed? IS THIS A FLAWED BRACKET?!
Diet Sodas all taste so terrible!
I call it soda, but when I was little I called it "bubbly drinks"
Be civilized. Drink tea.
soda. pop reminds me of otter pops. and calling all sodas coke is as stupid as calling all consoles a Nintendo.
Mr. pibb zero
Canadian: Pop
I would recommend one of the first diet soda but they don’t make TAB and it’s called pop
Stevia deserves love and respect
Pop!
Matpatt is like my mom with diet drinks at first you think it's really healthy because of the word diet but it is not
1) bro MatPad how many theory channels do you have? 2) companies just use too much stevia to sweeten their food/drinks, use stevia for a lot of things in my home and it’s practically indistinguishable from sugar in most circumstances, you just have to use the right amount to match the sweetness of sugar that way stevia is already healthier and you use tons less qua titles than you would use of sugar.
Food lion isn’t in other states?
Best replacement is water... or water with lemon juice
enjoy your cancer
Now MatPat will give his son the new favorite coke to live by
One word: Faygo
Why caffeine free diet Pepsi and not normal diet Pepsi?
Bro y’all did all this in one video.... no hate but GMM would take like 4 days to do this
You can do this matpat addictions are tough to get over i believe in you
Diet mountain dew tastes pretty well
soda im in
I'm just happy to see Freddy's pop up at the end.  And Big K does have citric acid...
I was interested to watch because my son in his 20's is a fan of diet coke. I don't like any diet soda. And a midget size can of something regular is the most I can handle once or twice a year.  With that said good video.
As someone born in the south and still lives here, I've never heard anyone refer to carbonated beverages as Coke in the general term unless they specifically meant Coca cola. It's just soda or soft drinks everywhere I've been down here.
Drinks Diet Coke when living in the state that invented Pepsi.
Why did this show in my recommended
There is a lot of good dite pop out there like mdew, Dr pepper or if you like tic tacs there is coca cola tik tacs
You will never be able to get it were your living as its a northwest drink, but a good one for Cola lovers out there Is Royal crown, Or RC, Cola
The only reason I know food lion is because my family would go on trips and that would be the only store near by and they had the purple Doritos before every other store, but it was in Tennessee not north carolina
Make a root beer tournement!
Here in Californina we call it soda
Stopped drinking soda completely and has been very beneficial for my health, water bro lol js
I'm not a diet soda fan, but these results still baffled me. I live close to a store that sells Kroger sodas, and let me tell ya, they're AWFUL. I've never had their diet cola, but the Dr. K tasted SO BAD that we actually washed all of the cups in our house, because we thought that was the only way a drink could ever taste so DIRTY. Like literally, it tasted like actual, from the ground dirt. I've never since bought it again, but had some at a party. Same dirt taste. Never again.
I love all different types of cokes. I try not to drink them very much anymore, but Dr. Pepper is probably my favorite type of coke.
Can confirm that Kroger's Big K brand Diet Cola has Citric Acid....the plot thickens ....or sweetens?....
I was a little dissapointed that Zevia didn't win. I'm quite a fan of it. If you're ever in the Seattle area though, you should give Jones Diet Soda a try to see if you like it.   As for the name choice: I tend to call it either Soda or Pop.
WWHHHAAAT YOUR FROM NC IM FROM NC
You should definitely try boylans cane cola, it’s actually really good
Water, bro
Video: “I quit Diet Coke”  Me: “Hahahahahaha No!”
You two look like you're closely related 😬
Wait, Mat likes diet coke? I don't think he mentioned that once since 2012, when I started watching the series
Broke your own rules. Fountain soda is not readily available unless you install a fountain in your home.
I love Diet Coke!  Cold can Diet Coke!!      I use it hate it as a kid now I can not drink regular Coke .
To start this theory, I pulled out my Diet Coke.
Every body know coke from glass bottels  is the best
NO :(
Ironically enough I have heard of Food Lion, I worked at the one down the road from my house down here in Delaware. 😝👍🦁  Also I’ve always known it as B (Soda) and didn’t know it was called anything different whatsoever until I worked with someonewho was from New Mexico and explained that every soda that’s a Coke product is called “Coke” and that every other soda product is called “Pop”, blew my mind when I heard that at 19.
Love Matt Pat
Crystal Pepsi came out briefly a couple years ago. I enjoyed it.
Steph needs to not spread the lie that we call it all coke. Way to reaffirm S.C is better lol
BIG K IS AMAZING! I love all of their flavors and buy them online to get them in florida.
Things you know about Mat Pat - Diet coke
goodbye sweet diet coke
You could have used blind folds for the stevia soda
DR PEPPA BAAAAAAAABBBBBBYYYYYYYYYYY
I feel like Matt shouldn't know which is going against which
I don't drink diet coke I drink the normal one
You should 100% do this for sprite, Dr Pepper, and Mello yellow, this was super cool.
I only like water and not coke and cola and stuff its bad
How can food/drink have zero caleries?
Fifteen calories is light enough
Soda, anyone who calls it anything other than soda can die in a ditch unless they're a kid and just hasn't learned yet
No way fountain should ever be the major bracket one
Shame I gave up on Soda, because there’s at least 3 Harry Teets within 4 miles of me
we call everything coke lol
I don't even drink anything but water orange juice and strawberry milkshake and nothing coke related or any of that and im still watching this
On my way to smiths to see if it has the same diet cola
also with coke having variations in bottle/can/fountain  wont major brand like pepsi have that too so shouldnt you be comparing all can or all bottle etc?
Meanwhile, I just drink water... sweet delicious dutch tap water
After seeing the "behind the scenes" moment, I have to say that it must have been meant to be.
Mattpat is my brother from another artificial sweetener mother.
Haven’t watched it but I’m sure he probably going to like Coke Zero... he just look like the type.
Dr. Pepper with Cream Soda Zero. Best diet soda ever. Good luck finding it.
I watched this video while drinking diet coke
Did you guys eat or drink something in between taste tests? if so what did you use?
I'm Australian. We call it soft drink (or, occasionally, soda - but that might be a Queenslander thing).
Turns out this is the true reason they made food theory!!
Does MatPat love Diet coke more than Kell loves Orange soda?
Soda pop is what I say
I took a SIP of diet coke before just to see if it was regular or not and....IT STAINED MY MOUTH FOR HOURS HOW CAN YOU DRINK THAT TAR??? You have NO TASTE IN YOU AT ALL. Your might aswell drink straight liquid sugar.
I prefer carbonated flavored water over soda myself as I mostly drink soda for the carbonation.
My family in Indiana say them ALL
"No one has heard of" Bold of you to assume I have not heard of Food Lion
“Food lion which you probably never heard of”  Me: *dancing in Virginia with food lions littered all over the state*
In Ohio we say POP lol.. i used to get funny looks when talkin to people in the south.
Coke Zero da best, I agree with da wife
18:38 "i wasn't fighting for a coke product" dude cocacola is coke is the same company
RC! Drink royal crown Cola it’s the best soda byyyyy far!
Everything is a coke around me
In PA we call it “Pepsi Products”
MattPat is not a soda drinker, he is carbonated beverage connoisseur
I wonder if he ever tasted Senku's cola
We always called it pop growing up but when I heard the word soda for the first time I realized how much better soda was. It just feels more refined than POP!
It might not be Kroger but Cott Industries
"I QUIT Diet Coke!" lies
Pepsi Max is my go to.  I don't know if it's different from country to country though.
A: Pop
15:33 B
Soda gang
I always get made fun of because I say soda pop. ☠️☠️
Rooting for coke zero. Bottled is my choice though, more carbonated.
I've all but quit soda in general and I feel better in general
Soda/Coke interchangeably, depends on the restaurant.
Diet Dr Pepper tastes like regular Dr Pepper
It also changes taste weather it was warm or cold. Like Coca Cola is meant to be warm, Pepsi is meant to be served cold.
Ok the rock paper scissors contest was so cute and hilarious
Six consecutive rock paper scissor ties... Are you two the same person? LOL
I cut out soda for a year and kept off 30lbs... it’s just a cup of sugar carbonated so we wonder why everyone got so obese in the last 20 years...
in tea land we call them fizzy drinks because they go fizz
Googled matpat created sans meme and found that his full name is Matthew Robert Patrick. I want more of MatBobPat
this made me think of a diet coke theory
Cuz it's bad for you?
The fact that harris teeter did so good makes me 😂
Take Zevia from your list, it tastes as bad as Tab!
I don’t even know if they still make Pepsi one.. but would one calorie really exclude something? I’m assuming yes with the coke life gag; which does taste apple-y... and delightful.
Diet soda is a toxic substance that is more likely to give you the diabeetus. Your a slightly better off to drink a regular soda with real sugar. Sugar substitutes give your body a insulin reaction that can be up to 1000x higher then regular sugar.
my dads family calls it pop and my moms side call it coke lmao i just call it soda
Jolli cola and rc cola are the best, dont drink sugar free drinks you will get diabetes.
Dude my grandmother lives in North Carolina and I visit her every once in a while. But I specifically remember the food chain Food lion and how she drinks their Colas instead of Coke because they’re cheaper
I am pleased with your work attitude
Me who can't tell the difference between pepsi and coke: *I N T E R E S T I N G*
mat pat is known for his red jacket, fnaf, diet coke and now CITRIC ACID
No one should drink diet drinks...they were always just a trick to keep soda sales up...
For me it was,"soda pop"
I’m sorry bro but if you were considering changing your soda team why does it specifically have to be diet do you have like a grudge against regular soda or cola? Why don’t you give regular coke or any other kind of cola a chance to win your heart? Regardless I hope one day you talk about this so I’m not just always wondering why not? That’s all, I love you matpat keep up the theories...forever.
next week: "food theory: ALL YOUR SODA IS THE SAME!"
And I'm out here calling them fizzy drinks
Hey Matt, not sure if you'll see this but the payless logo you used at the end is actually Guam's local branch and not the one for the kroger subsidiary. Just jumped out to me seeing that logo so I had to search and for sure that logo seems to be only used in Guam. The USA based logo is an apple.
Soda and I grew up in Georgia.
This video is just GMM: Matpat Edition
14:27 this proves Pepsi sucks💀
Matpatt's well known for the red jacket? I thought the lime suit was more famous than that
Basically an episode of Good Mythical Morning with MattPatt lol
In Ireland we call carbonated drinks minerals or there individual brands
Anything "diet" is pure trash.
You just shouldn’t drink soda period
They should have posted this on April Fools Day. Lol.
Other: Because I'm not a native English speaker, to us it's "brus", however if you were to do a direct translation the word would be "fizz".
Mat and Stef just going rock, rock, rock? That’s how you know they’re married. Also, adorable.
If mat pat gets cancer we can confirm diet coke is  the culprit.
I was like “if he got some Smith’s diet cola then that would 100% be the winner.” Lo and behold... lol
I knew this was going to be a good episode, when Steph called him Matthew within the first 2 min lol
Kroger coming out of nowhere with some of the best pop/soda I have tasted. give a box of that root beer.
My personal opinion and advice is, don't drink any "diet" drinks containing aspartame. Treat the stuff like poison. Because that's exactly what it is.
“I quit diet coke.”  “Well that’s ni-“  “So I swapped my diet coke addiction for a different diet cola that tastes better.”
Warm water.
Can you please upload a video on the 23rd of march because I'm a HUGE fan of you and my birthday is on the 23rd of March.
But where’s the Pepsi max?? 😭😭
Does anyone else think that the Harris Teeter logo look sorta like Yoshi?
now do one with real colas.
I worked at food lion for a little over a year at two different locations. While I don't regret the second location, I do regret working at food lion in general. They dont treat their workers well. We got zero benefits what so ever and what we had to deal with wasn't worth it. I don't recommend working there. But I do recommend shopping there I personally feel their prices are amazing without loosing value in the food.
That's fascinating because I drink Coke Zero, my dad drinks Diet Coke, and we have a Kroger less than a mile away from us. I'm thinking we might need to try some Big K Diet Cola and see how it stacks up for us.
You gotta say what kind of coke you want, and yes it can be Dr.Pepper
But the bigger question is why go back to drinking coke?
Sadly there arent any Kroger owned stores in southwestern Pennsylvania...
Don’t drink any kind of soda
Diet Coke: "I used to rule the world"
Just say the name of the product you want; Want a fanta? ask for that. Want a cola, ask for it ... but don't be surprised if they plop an pepsi in front of you.
I was wondering how the F somebody could talk for 25 minutes about diet coke. Now I see how. He didn't... They talked more about their selves. What a total waste of a brain.
I say pop, bc I grow up in the Midwest, so yah pop.
I miss NC
Vikos cola, it's from Greece, you should try it
"sweet n low" aka "sodium saccharin" is the BEST fake sweetener, its still not good tasting, but at least it doesn't make you want to vomit.
Man you should try brio, but don’t know if you can get it where you are
Kroger is King Soopers for me and I buy their Zero calorie 'Cola Oh.' Good stuff.
Fun fact: Diet Coke and Coke Zero contain Aspartame, which not good for anyone to consume.
As someone from Florida I'm just thankful you included Publix! We all knew it wouldn't win. We are grateful to be represented.
Excellent episode enjoyed that, thanks
I will say, Shasta everything else sucks, but Shasta root beer is really good
me: reads title also me: wha-

nah she was right, "and fl" fl is a YANKEE state.
Nice jacket by the way
I’m from upstate New York and I’m a soda person
Try blue sky soda it's non gmo
I’m from upstate New York and I’m a soda person
For the first in my years of watching this channel, matpat has lied to! Florida is not the Southeast, its New Yorks retirement home!
It's hard to quit soda I been homeless 10 years lived on soda in highschool and chips n soda last 10 , health is weath ,
I’m definitely in the minority, but I enjoy both Zevia and Whole Foods 365 🦄
In the Midwest, it’s Soda. It’s just in the small northern section near Michigan (which, let’s be honest, Michigan hasn’t been the “‘Midwest” since 1816) that calls it “Pop”.
NO ONE with a brain has a "favorite" diet soda, only one that they can tolerate without getting sick.
I call my soda “other”
I say pop, soda, soda pop, fizzy juice, whatever comes to mind lol
ALL "diet" sodas are TERRIBLE for you. regular soda is ACTUALLY better for you in the long run....still not good, just better.
regular coke is what you replace the poison water known as diet coke with.
Anyone here with an option to get Boylan, get a grape soda of theirs if you like grape. Soooooooo good
i live in redding which is very close to shasta that's an insult to me
The clickbait
I don't drink diet sodas, and I've never heard of Harris Teeter. However, I grew up on Kroger brand foods, including the sodas. I usually prefer Kroger brand stuff over the name brands. Is that a result of growing up with it, or because it's ACTUALLY THE SAME THING, just with a different label?
D:other, here in the land down under (Australia) we call it cool drink
b soda
Ok. Dayum. 2.3millions subs. So quickly. Holy heavens
"0 calorie" it's less than 5 per serving b sure, but truly 0 calorie is impossible for anything your body can digest other than water
Dude, you're the theorist! You seriously believe zero calorie sodas actually have no calories?
Time to invest in Harry's
Diet dr pepper is great. Try that one.
Pop
Wow. I'm actually in NC rn. I had no idea. Too bad I'll never get to see yall before I ship out to Japan.
The girl looks like Aliana ghen
Australian here and we say "Soft Drink" when referring to soda/pop.
I never knew how many Diet Coke addicts existed until I worked at a grocery store. You knew who they were once they entered the store.They laser beamed the coveted silver colored box like a heat seeking missile as soon as they entered the soft drink aisle. If we were low on supply, they went into full on manic rants. "Where's the DIET COKE?! Why are you always low on supply?" I don't know. Ask your fellow addicts.
Here in canada, the drink is called soda, but the bottles are called pop bottles
imagine going with fountain soda over any bottled soda
I’m starting to think the krabby patty secret formula is citric acid...
"The generic, the store brands, whatever... Totally legit" *ALDI has entered the chat
Don't you mean drink up?
I can't stand the taste of aspartame, so I never got into the diet coke fad. I got some flavor mixes for water, and I had to toss them out after the first use. I guess it isn't too bad, though, aspartame has been linked to some minor short-term memory loss. As with most science there are different results, depending on what you search for(terminology affects search results and can lead to biased results). Also, fountains tend to add a bit extra syrup to compensate for any ice that may be present. This is so that by the time you get to the bottom it's not too diluted. This is probably why you preferred the fountain cup
Harris Teeter replaces Diet Coke.
*MEANWHILE AT PEPSI  and COCA COLA HQ* "WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!?!?!? OUR BIGGEST SUPPORTER JUST CONDUCTED HIS OWN EXPERIMENT AND WE WERE BEATED OUT BY A HARRIS TEATER SODA!!!  HOW DID WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!??!?!"
Here in England most people just call it fizzy. I don't think I've heard anyone here call it pop
bye bye diat coke
Your taste tasting process hurts me. If you're blind tasting to find your new favorite, guessing which is which is hurting your bias. You need to choose solely based on taste and not your prejudice of the product. And would it have been hard to find a non-seethrough drink container to test the clear one?  If something is worth doing, it's worth doing properly.
In minnesota here it is always called pop. I don't like it when people say but soda is short for soda pop because pop is even shorter
Is this the guy who pranks people with the glitter bombs?
That was the most instant game of Rock paper scissors i've ever seen! 😂
Aww no RC cola
Mat Pat: **This Vid** Me: Write that down, write that down!
club soda gets the job done
Just drink La Croix
My northerner brain has never heard of half these brands
So, I'm from South Africa and over here, we call all fizzy drinks "cold-drink" but somehow pronounced by almost all South African's as 'coldrink'. No Pop or Soda in these parts.
So nobody is going to mention that her face at 20:46 looks like she is...
Mat's playing hard to get to finally secure that Coca-Cola sponsorship
Me: Don't share a straw that's not sanitary Me (5 minutes later): oh yeah, they're married and made another human together, sharing straws is probably fine
Here in my neck of the woods, we call it cooldrink/cold drink😶
I hate all diet soda it just tastes so weird
Not talking about specifics but my family likes "Sam's cola" a bit more than Coke'Cola.
I quit drinking all soda and eating at drive thru restaurants in 2006, but never miss an episode...  Well, except the Dr Fauci interview.  That was disgustingly unwatchable.
Pepsi Max Cherry my dude.
you are wrong Stephanie we call it soda  most of our like soda machines are coke and have coke products
I'm from Ohio like MatPat (Central Ohio to be precise), and basically all three terms (Soda, Pop, Coke) were kinda used interchangeably. In fact, the term "Soda Pop" was used as well. A mix of two of them. So I never got the "Soda vs. Pop" war. To me both were correct.
It’s gonna be a little strange when MattPat talks about “slamming Harris Teeter to get the creative juices flowing for the latest FNAF theory”... doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the same I guess
Food lion actually belongs to Delhaize, a Belgian food company. I didn't know Belgium made diet cola
Can or bottle. I will drink it
Yep. Big K is kroger store brand and is exactly the same.
I too love a great Coke all the time
Oh don't worry steph I don't count Florida as a South East state (and I live here) but I lived in north Carolina when I was four so seeing these store brands a kind of nostalgic
Jo, wtf. Here in Germany i cant even buy the most of this sodas
The image before you click on the video just made me sad
I’m really mad you didn’t drink the best diet soda out there, diet Dr Pepper
Boylan's is my favorite of those ngl  Edit: I've never had the diet one, I guess it's way worse than regular one
Pepsi zero sugar? Pepsi max?
If a criteria for the choices of contestants was that it was available to purchase in a store near you, why did you include the fountain version of diet coke?  Unless you're going to put a coke machine in your house and purchase the supplies to make it, or you go to a restaurant whenever you want to drink diet coke.
You should do a theory on matzos
D. Fizzy drink
No diet RC cola?! Shocking I’m a Coke Zero guy
Matpat you know there is one more category taste after time has elapsed will it get old
YES!!!!!!!!! I prefer kroger brand soda over the big name brands
Over HERE in the Midwest we call it a sodie
Wait a second. You dont call all soda coke everywhere else??????? DA HECK????
I just want to say this is a great video. My mom recently got diagnosed with cancer after having consumed Diet Coke for years and I have sworn off diet sodas forever
D, i live in the netherlands and we call it cola or a collaatje
Am I the only person who hates soda... I feel like I’m missing out on something.

TOP 10 ANIME BETRAYALS  FOOD WARS 2.0 MAT AND DIET COKE
I cannot go to McDonald's without getting a Diet Coke with no ice. My entire life. It pairs so well. And it doesn't taste the same from any other place or a can/bottle. Even going to a different mcdonald's than usual it tastes wrong now.
Diet coke is throat acid.
Spoiler . . . . . . . And to think, if you *had* gotten that Diet Coke sponsorship you probably would've lost it here.
Desapointed at start. Need a base. All bottle or can or funtaine. But not mix bottle vs funtaine. You define that at the beginning. Funtain is better them bottle.... Sorry
Diet Fanta diet mountan dew
Have you tried water?
You should have taken a day between tastings to sort of.... Forget the flavors xD
It is called fizzy juice, not soda but ok
What a tweest!
A few years ago, I quit drinking diet soda cold turkey. I was drinking them all day long at work. Got to the point where I was getting bad headaches and migraines. I actually went through withdraw for a good week. I guess it was the aspartame because diet soda is actually addicting.
Reading the comments I feel sad being the only one who likes the zevia brand, although I’ve only tried it’s root beer not the cola.
Pop
New England calls it "Tonic"
Crystal Pepsi was around 1992 BTW. Then there was Blue Pepsi in 2002... Most people hated it... I loved it.   Also fountain cola varies wildly from machine to machine.
Pepsi
Thumbnail: I quit Diet Coke Everyone else: WTF HAPPENED?!?
Ah yes stevia the only sugar thats ever given me multiple migranes :/
"Publix specializes in the southeast United States" "And Florida"  ...No, no...she's right.
In New England and the mid-Atlantic states, we call it soda.
Have you ever gone without drinking diet coke long enough to taste the aspartame? I've heard from a long time drinker that they couldn't taste it, but then really disliked the aspartame taste once they tried it again after not having it for a few months.
*oh no* anyway
drink squirt
is green cola a thing there? it does have stevia and i tasted it at first, but since i had it constantly throughout 2019-20, regular cola tastes weird now. i don't distinguish the stevia now, unless i have to think about it and try to distinguish it. i also found that it has the least sh!t in it, so that helped me choose it. (i do try drinking less soda now though)
No you didn't I rejct to belive this
Harris Teeter Diet Cola sales 📈📈📈
Coke Zero in the old aus got rebranded as “no sugar” never heard anyone call it as such
Idk maybe just normal water it fine with me.
I figured they wouldn't like it but I like the strong flavour of Boylan as it's an 'every now and then' treat. I mostly drink sparkling water to get my fizz.
Zero calorie cola. That's the very definition of an oxymoron.
Fun fact: there was a secret stash of crystal cleared cola exclusively made for famous Soviet Union General Georgy Zhukov after WW2, the man asked Truman to alter the drink and secretly smuggle it into the State just for him. Don't even try to find these, because you guessed it, he drank it all
Didn't realize how small range Harris Teeter and Food Lion were. There's been a Food Lion within a few miles of every house I've lived in.
As someone who has like 15 million Publix’ it’s so good feeling to know you non Floridians don’t experience it
We just 50/50 asking for coke or pepsi and just drink whatever we end up with. 80% of the time we end up with the other one.
Hi fans! Please join Ro Lyss and SUBSCRIBE.
So there's a harris teeter basically right next to my house and I've never tried the soda and now I want to try it.
top 10 anime betrayals
"365 zero calorie cola" sounds like a sneaky way of writing how many calories it might actually have in it lol
At my place, we don’t have diet coke, we only have coca cola 0 (wich has 0 calories)
Regular coke should replace diet coke, please also only get coke from Florida it’s where they make it the best
I say soda, but everyone treats me like I'm crazy cause the term used here is pop, lol.
As someone who works in food manufacturing as well as custom food manufacturing (small company producing extra product for a big company), I can tell you that there are  a lot of exactly the same products you can get cheaper from a different brand.  For instance, sargento brand shredded cheese and Kraft shredded cheese are exactly the same. The same ingredients in the same amounts just made on a different set of machinery because sargento wants it that way.  Also, if you know of the turkey brand Jennie-o, their turkey bacon is exactly the same as great value turkey bacon just with a different label (and a little "looser" quality standard but that's neither here nor there) but I think that more location specific.
Fountain is always better for some reason.
A.
If you're from North Carolina, you already knew Food Lion brand and Harris Teeter brand was going to make some noise in this tournament.
Gotta say (sorry for the pepsi fans) i do not like pepsi, i always got stomach ache because of it. So coke is better than pepsi for me.
NOPE!!!!🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️ YOU ARE COMPARING tap diet cola vs bottle everything else 🙄.  This doesn't even remotely work thwy would all have to be bottle or tap 🤔No sip swap !!!!!
Ah yes, something I've given up and can't have with a broken ankle
Try normal coke....
D.. fizzy drink.
“Food lion, which you’ve probably never heard of” Me, a North Carolinian: yeah I’ve heard of it
We rarely ever drink diet coke lol
Soda. I have never ever heard a person in real life say anything else except maybe soft drink but 95% or more it’s soda. I’ve lived in several western states but mostly California and Arizona
Technically coke but i never understood the whole everything is one word thing lol. I always just said whatever I wanted like if I wanted a coke I'd say coke then have to repeat myself -.-  Also @Food Theorist I live in the triangle if your close we also frequent drive to MS to visit family they have kroger there and I can hook you up if you want to test your theory lol.
hate to be the one to say this but 0 calories dont mean zero in the USA and im not sure about other countrys but they are allowed to round down on food labels if its 5 or less calories
I'm D In Ibstock in the UK in England we call Coke, Pepsi and others, as just Child Bear
I absolutely HATE stevia, it tastes terrible — but the worst part is, because it’s technically a “natural” sweetener, they don’t have to say “artificial sweetener” on the products it’s in. You HAVE to read the ingredient list.  So sometimes i’ll get a beverage or snack, try it, and then have to throw it out because the stevia flavor is so bad.
Yeah i miss you mentioning diet coke just like back in the days
When your family is adicted to cola:
WHY
Himouto! Umaru-chan
Diet coke is just as bad as regular coke
Splenda has calories though -gasp- So does that even count?
Is it just me or does food lion look exactly like hannafords brand
I call them fizzy drinks
You will have diabetes
That woman is incredibly attractive
matpat: get out of here diet coke  diet coke: oh i will but your going to come crawling and begging for me to come back
In the Philippines we call it "sopdrinks"
as a North Carolinian, this was really fun to watch
3:45 with subtitles its not that family friendly
As a diet cola hater, I'd like to know if the regular versions of these are equally tasty
15:52 battle of the south biggest lie ever Food Lion isnt a south USA brand it isnt even American not suprissed it mayd it this far as it has a huge chain in Belgium called "Delhaize"
Matt looks like the ben 10 with the gray hair from alien force.
Zevia drinks (including cola flavor) are my jam.
Having lived in Louisiana for 40 years, I've never heard anyone indiscriminately call a random soda coke, unless it was actually Coca Cola. We say pop!
I was none, as a kid I was a "soft drink" person kinda sad to not see it up there
Diet sunkist is God’s nectar
shame that they don't have Fritz Kola
I have a Kroger near me. I'm gonna have to try it out
I'm a brit we say fizzy
Sorry, where do I know you from ?
You should have written 0-10 score seperately each time to avoid the power of suggestion
North Carolina for life
Do a theory on what’s better cereal or milk first
D other - we call them cold drinks  but you will also hear us call it coke even if its sprite /dr pepper
where i live in the netherlands we call it "frisdrank" which literally translates to fresh drink
Swedish soda called Trocadero is the best
Theory: MattyPatty created this channel as an excuse to drink all these diet coke.
I love this channel because it's his one channel that he can do experiments along with the theories.
If you ever get a chance to try Diet Dr. Thunder. DO IT.
What about Coke Zero it has zero sugar and it tastes really good still even comes in cherry
That's cool and all but I am still wondering where is the "theory" part of the title
Diet Coke tastes like cancer
Its mostly called Fizzy Drink here in England.
Food Theory: exists  Citric acid: "My time to shine"
Because I'm from Britain we just call them fizzy drinks which makes so much more scenes
Always thought you two looked like.  Now with that rock paper scissors fiasco, you somehow managed to marry yourself. I just want to know who the original is?
Diet Soda is fake and unappetizing
Diet is actually worse for you
I love those tournaments
Calling it citric acid theory
soda is kinda gross
My family calls it fuzz
other soft drink
What
In india its "cold drink". Then you have to choose among flavours
Pepsi gang anyone?
Remember even if Pepsi had beaten Food Lion our NC would be representing cause Pepsi was made in New Bern NC
Diet coke: Exist  American: *Emmmmm heath drink*
You Americans XD the world tastiest seen even tho he only looks at meri products you do it with your sports as well world champions eve tho only meri teams compete
I started laughing when they said it was Kroger. For what ever reason, Kroger food is always better. I'll take there chips over Lay's any day. Rhett and Link have done taste tests with Kroger winning all the time.
Diet Pepsi/Pepsi Max is soooo much better than Diet Coke (and regular Coke).
no one told him he doesn't have to commit to a single cola?
Mega image is called food lion in america?
I'm freakin' packing my bags and traveling to your location to try it! 😅
bruh diet coke no sugar coke and coke zero same thing
I think my wife of 15 years would leave me before she left Diet Coke
This was very entertaining
Big K (Kroger Brand) Diet Cola Ingredients: Ingredients Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Phosphoric Acid, Aspartame*, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), CITRIC ACID, Caffeine, Natural Flavor
Here's a food theory: the aspartame is diet drinks is slowly embalming your guts.
Do a theory about is vanilla coke and classic coke the same thing
Who else got their Bracket Busted????
I am addicted water;)
The fix was in. Matpat just wanted to get away from spending hundreds of dollars on Coke products every month.
Lipton ice tea lemon
Your thing is diet coke and I love that
AND IRRESPONSIBLE
UNREAL
UNBELIEVABLE
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE
YOU WHAT!?!
Diet Coke missed their chance to sponsor him, they’ve now lost 50% of their money now that Matpat is not drinking it anymore
Warning. Large doses of sucralose act as a laxative....
Silly for drinking it in the first place. Ditto any other so-called diet products.
Word of caution when it comes to Soda Stream: use filtered water like from a Brita to make it. Guaranteed to taste 100x better than with regular tap water. Just an FYI.
I do Believe what you are Describing is the exact same as DR. K From Freddy’s Matpat. A slight cherry taste on top of what is essentially Diet Coke
Umm as a Dr Pepper addict I will say it is a COLA it is a cherry flavored cola and it was founded before coke and Pepsi one year before coke Dr Pepper was founded and about 80 years later Pepsi was founded
I do have to wonder if Mat isn't just in love with the novelty of the flavor of Harris Teeter brand, especially after having tasted so many colas during the day. But time will tell.
How healthy is it all though? That should probably influence your choice a bit
Isn't diet coke just re-branded coke zero?
i’m D other cuz I live in Britain and we call it a Fizzy Drink  🥤
Have you tried water? It’s pretty gooood!~
Hi
It's the end of an era.
You two are so cute together!!!
Dridnking diet is pretty bad for you though.
I am none of them, we call them fizzy drinks in the UK
we buy Big K soda all the time in the summer for bbq  party because it cost like 75 cents for 2 liter bottles and nobody can tell it is not the same. even the big K dr pepper  dr.K rip offs  we just pass it out and people think we spent for the real stuff.
"Never heard of Food Lion"..... as someone from Texas I hear the name and I think of "Bleached ground beef"....  It was a scandal back in the early 90s. Dunno if it's the same company though....
Root Beer 🍺 👍🏾
I feel like shasta could've gotten higher in the list if it wasn't competing as and against a diet drink, everything made by shasta is good but their diet drinks, but yeah their diet sucks bad
The fucks basketball 🤔
Im other
im so sad..        and happy
You betrayed your brothers....
all diet sodas taste like you are eating  random chemicals from  some kids  toy laboratory set
Boylan sounds like the Necco Wafers of sodas BT Dubbs...Ya know what else is in Sucrelose....CHLORINE!  Yeah, clearly a healthier alternative, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure
What about the best one, glass bottle
Gave up Soda and Energy drinks year ago.  What I now call consumerism poison.  Cool experiment, but in no way I would use fountain pop as a control.
When does Matt find out that Food Lion is in alot of places... Or atleast is in the north east too, we have them everywhere in Maryland
3:46 lets get what O_O... I don’t hear pouring at all XD
D: personally I just call them fizzy drinks or call them by their names
Matpat Diet Coke is 1 calorie so diet coke is afishaly  not allowed.
One issue is, fountain Diet Coke is different at each place that has it.
How is be theory though?
We have a winner 🏆🏆🏆🏆
“Impress me”         “We start at dawn.”
Don't bother, it's all chemicals your body never evolved to deal with in the first place. Drink water or tea or lemonade or cane sugar soda. Your body knows what to do with sugar, just don't drink to much of it.
Coke zero.... though I'll stick with diet cherry Dr pepper.....when I can find it lol
Steph's face at MatPat's choices at the end. Absolute comedic justice. I'm now curious to try this with the types of soda I like. I know I have done a little comparison kinda here and there but nothing significant.
I have tried the Big K diet coke from Smith's and it is extremely chemically. It's definitely doesn't have that fruitiness either. It's surprisingly not the same.
I have tried the Big K diet coke and it is extremely chemically. It's definitely doesn't have that fruitiness either.
It's underhand Mat corrupting Stephanie to join Zero Sugar Soda
Well....it's nice to know that I will never taste a Soda wich was classified as nr.1 by the MatPat given that I do not live in america.....truly it is a sad sad thing.
Wow
Harris Teeter brand deals in the future? 👀
im soda
We in Australia call them soft drinks
7:07 Boylan 7th seeded 9:07 Diet Pepsi 7th seeded
So what this proves is that people didn't care as much what they were drinking in the 1800s.
I thought the only thing with zero calorie is water!
Coke cola is 100% better then Pepsi (my opinion)
Cola.....well as a german you allways say cola.
Honesty, as an avid pop/soda drinker, I appreciate this episode. My favorite drinks are mountain dew code red and cane sugar pepsi, although I haven't seen a code red in three years, but I'll find it one day
love that matpat and steph play rock paper scissors like a game of strength of will
Coke Zero for me. I would like to try harris teeter though.
I call bullsh*t
I'm still waiting for the fourth theory channel, we have game theory(green, top right logo), film theory(red, top right logo), food theory(yellow, bottom left logo), so now we need a channel with a blue, bottom right logo.
The universe protected it during RPS, it was a last minute draft, and the winner. That soda is magic.
Bro why do you look so old and weird in the thumbnail but normal in the vid 💀
I had sodas when I was younger but I never liked them, so I haven’t had them since and I honestly couldn’t be happier. I’m a sugar addict already, so not having sodas on top of the candy I constantly eat is a godsend
Stevia is just not good. It would be my pick if it didn't have such an offensive taste.
Me pulling up with Mountain Dew
The way is Fizzy Drink
Rip diet coke
diet coke: my time has come...
Tries to reduce bias.... knows which cola is what after first round 🤷🏼‍♂️ Best way to do it is to have the commentary to explain which one was what but to have complete blind brackets and tasting until the very end. Or else knowing Diet Coke is in a bracket will automatically increase bias. Bad science plain and simple. Should have reacted to the bracket results when it was all over and done with. Not to mention they aren’t washing out their mouths between different samples and as such introduces error.
I like the store brand fredys diet coke so might need to do a road trip and another soda theory
Pulling a Markiplier huh
It's called fizzy juice here
Matoat try iornbru
There is no sane reason you are not sponsored by a beverage company.
They gone be going to the bathroom s lot after dis vid
Should've added normal coke and Pepsi as a control
Just drink normal coke
i am a soft drink
In the Philippines, we mostly use "soft drink" to refer to these carbonated, sugary liquids. Some people might say "soda" as well. But never "pop".
For me growing up in Ohio I have always been a pop person
MatPat vs MathewPattew
sooo what about food lion vs diet coke though :P
B. Soda
It's soda in my neck of the woods
ah yes...Us north Carolinian's have similar and good tastes ( Harris teeter is the best)
Food 4 less diet cola was the only cola I could drink all the rest made me hate it
noooooooooooooo how could he do that to diet coke
Excuse me but glass bottle is the best of any pop flavor ever
I live in Louisiana and we either call it soda, soft drink, or coke
Diet Mountain Dew is the only diet soda I’ve found that doesn’t have that weird diet taste
Interesting thing... In Australia, we call it soft drink... some people say soda, but most people just say soft drink
c coke
I have a weird favorite soda, Its blueberry soda from maine. Its really good, and doesn’t have caffine!
I saw the title and thought "why are you lying??" 🤔🤣🤣
Food and games
In Australia we just call it fizzy drinks or more commonly soft drinks.
Old school mass...... "tonic"
Suggestion: cover liquid meal replacements like Huel and Soylent. Interesting food trend, no?
Diet coke isn't that bad for you... You know what is bad for you? Obesity one of the top causing deaths in American, diet coke had 0 calories and therefor has 0 effect on weight change. Cals in cals out, drink 0 calories anything instead of sugar
Personally I can't drink diet soda's since they use aspartame, and excessive consumption of aspartame can cause brain tumors, weight gain, and as Mat has demonstrated aspartame addiction
I'm from the midwest and have always said soda. maybe it depends on where in the midwest
We got Food Lion here in VA to, maybe I should check out the cola? hmm
MatPat has finally experienced the "Moxie-era" effect of sodas.
diet soda can cause cancer tho!
MATTHEW THE NUMBERS ARE SUPPOSED TO ADD TOGETHER TO EQUAL 17 PLZ
The Kroger "Cola Oh!" sounds similar to what you describe of Harris Teeter. It has a little something different than Coke products or Kroger's standard diet cola, which is also reasonably good. Quite nice among diet cola flavors.   And really nice when it's generally a half or a third the price of Coke with frequent coupons for extra discounts.
We say "drink" to refer to any soda in the part of Tennessee I'm from
Mat giving up diet coke is like bugs bunny giving up carrots
All Pop is Soda, but not all Soda is Pop. Soda is just carbonated water, where Pop specifically refers to carbonated water with sweetener and flavoring. Think of the same difference as liquor vs liqueur.
Cinderella story, out of nowhere, former greenskeeper, now about to become the Masters champion. It looks like a mirac--it's in the hole! It's in the hole!
It's Dr. Pepper for me or Mountain Dew. Only have about 2 cans a week though. Iced coffee is where its at. The brand I buy outsells Coca-Cola where I live - only place in the world where a milk product outsells coke.
Fun fact: I worked at a coconut water company and Walmart reached out to us to invite us as a competitor for a private label coconut water. We went against Coke, and even though Coke offered $$$ to make their Zico label the Walmart Private Label coconut water, we won out on taste.
ALL diet soda has that nasty aftertaste. no to all of it.
I think maybe you got really lucky on the diet coke fountain drink as usually they are horribly watered down everywhere near me. Although typically the Coke Freestyle fountains are the best and I usually avoid places that don't have Freestyle fountains.
Does someone have a link to that red jacket?
Reeee
Here in australia it’s soft drink
There's no better soda drink on the planet than Irn Bru Zero... Cola is actually extremely disgusting its unreal. Untill you've tried a real soda, you can't comment here.
Well, here in little 'ol South Carolina, soda in most restaurants is referred to as "Coke Products" Although in my strongest opinion, I myself am a die hard A&W Root Beer fan.
Oh goddddddddd
Y’all should try some Canadian foods. I would straight up send you stuff if you wanted. I think that video would be interesting
Now I'm excited to try Harris Teeter eventually
If I ever co-hosted a video with my wife, and I let her have a stray strand of hair like Matt does to Steph here then I think she would divorce me.
wait the year everything went bad he didn't drink coke and when he started again it all stopped
Just saying diet Baja blast is hands down the best diet soda
soda
In Australia we call them soft drinks
Yeah...I'm pretty certain that Coke is paying you to make this. I will never go back to what was once my favorite soda company, Coca Cola. They fucked it up really fast by getting involved with politics.
Diet Coke taste disgusting
It seems pretty unfair to use the fountain version of Diet Coke, but bottle/can versions for the others. Unless he has a post mix fountain at home that he uses.
diet pepsi max : most caffeine of any soda except Jolt Diet Rite : No caff at all. If you need the hit, diet rite will not work
I 'quit' soda, and now make my own (kinda) - I make a shrub (basically a 1:1:1 of honey, apple cider vinegar, and crushed fruit) and add that to sodastream/carbonated water.  It's not overly sweet, has a nice acidic tang, and I can make it whatever flavour I like.
You forgot RC Cola
As someone who grew up drinking Diet Coke, this was an interesting one. Even more interesting knowing that Kroger, which was initially a small company in the Midwest that got bigger as I got through school, technically owns a bunch of smaller chains. I still have family living in the area where Kroger can be found. I'll report back in the future if I get to try their diet coke. I also did some digging and apparently Kroger uses some specific manufacturing plants. One is America's Beverage Co. and manufactures soft drinks in Texas, and one is Springdale Ice Cream & Beverage in Ohio. Your soda may depend upon which manufacturing location is closest.
Food Lion is sprinkled throughout the East Coast states. I live in WV, and there are 2 Food Lions relatively close to where I live. No longer than a 20 minute drive to either one.
Heh I hought this would be ab something like diet coke not being diet and how they somehow managed to find a loophole so they could make it unhealthy but not have it on the list of ingredients or something
Pepsi > Coke
In Singapore, I think it’s called soft drink
Hate Kroger.
I actually have a Smith's grocery store near me and now I am sorely tempted to buy some of their name brand sodas.
I called sodas fizz
the Snyder cut and Matt pat quits diet coke. What a week to be alive
i swear they are perfect for each other
You should've gargle with water in between taste test. This way your taste buds will be cleaned of residue of the previous colas.
Soda or coke
Heh.  I'm a Dr. Pepper hound. While I'm up for trying most sodas, I cannot stand diet colas at all.  Also, there's a local brand that a lot of restaurants use instead of Coca Cola here in WA that just tastes horrible to me.
22:45  Me during this whole video: Please tell me Kroger owns them, I could probably get it, or something similar to it at Pick n Save
Diet Pepsi sucks... That was not a surprise.
Me: *Reads title*  This might be more of a stretch than the Sans is Ness theory
I’m from Tennessee and I’ve never heard anyone call all soda ‘Coke’. It’s either soda for a collective, or the specific name of the individual drink
Diet Coke: "Sensei Kreese right I can't be my own worst enemy, but you can be!!!" MatPat: "Diet Coke I won't fight you!" Diet Coke: "You are weak!!!!" MatPat: Waxes Diet Coke with his review skills. MatPat if you get that reference you're a legend.
Matpat freaky eater
Imagine drinking diet soda when the sugar substitute is worse than sugar itself.  I myself drink sprite primarily and Dr pepper on nights where I don't care how late the caffeine makes me stay up. Sprite is just so good.
That sodastream cola is what I drink with my dad’s machine.
pepsy max
Just put MSG in it
New to the channel...maybe they're together...? But i would never share a straw with a coworker nowadays...am i missing something?
?????????????????
Definitely Coke for me option C
i think i'll stick with Pepsi Max, since i dont think Australia sells half of these drinks
People in the south call it Coke, but my whole family calls it call it Soda. #Texan4ever.
Glass bottle coke is best coke.
Soda/Coke
I wonder how their stomach reacts to diet colas mixed in
My Stepfather just went on Home dialysis You wanna help clean his tubes ?    He loves diet coke
diet pepsi is better; less bitey
I live in Ohio we typically just call it pop but I like just thinking soft drink because it sounds nice, but we never really call anything other than pop  Edit: spelling error
Coke Zero is my addiction, prefer it over any soda, have no clue why
Dr Pepper
Other: soft drink and soda
The joker cola won and... your walet
oh man not seeing soda in ice pains me!
I'm so excited for him that he found a new favorite at a store close to him.
As soon as I start this I see a problem.  Diet soda tastes terrible
My "Other" is Sugary Carbonated Beverage
Everyone knows that diet water is superior
Hey Mat& Stef, Main warehouse for Kroger in Atlanta Ga. we have them all over, will check out what other flavors they got too!
People: Debates soda or pop Me (Being Australian): Soft drink....
@MatPat can you please do a theory on the YT series Confinement by Lord Bung.
Coke no sugar?
I personally love diet drpepper
I'm sorry Matt but I've lost a lot of respect for you since you excluded diet dr pepper
To be honest, you messed up several times by sharing straws when you made such a big hooray for having em. Could have been executed better...
fred meyer good
Go to Trader Joe’s and find their version of cola it’s healthier and is still cola the brand is faygo
Coke Life is really good, but my local Ralphs decided to discontinue it.
" Food Lion, which you've probably never heard of"  *Laughs in North Carolinian*
March Matness. That's really cute. Did your son Oliver come up with that one?
Dr. Pepper isn't cola?
ZEVIA's other flavors are waaaaaaay better. the grape and dr pepper
How about dont drink diet anything because its horrible for you lol
0 calories? Wtf? Is that can filled with fucking water or what the heck?
Welcome to the Coke Zero club, Mat. I enjoy that soda whenever I feel like I’m consuming too much sugar. It’s perfect, especially since I’m a person who LOVES my ice cream. I eat a lot of sugar.      I should stop
Normal coke tastes better, both bad for your health, so atleast drink something that tastes good
cheerwine
Whole Food's Bizarre Sodas
also stevia i have no idea how to pronounce it and the only reason i know about is because my sisters a tea fanatic  is used in drips to sweeten tea.
the bad aftertaste of every diet soda combined with the fact that its counterproductive to diets anyways makes me wonder why they even exist, oh wait, yeah addiction and money.
“Soda” all the way. From the southwest desert. Definitely get weird looks in the Midwest restaurants 🤣
Coca-Cola will lose millions if Matt switches brands
I drink maybe 40 ounces of soda a year, and I haven't had so much as a drop of diet coke in my life, so I could give up root beer (my favorite soda) without too much difficulty.
Hey Mat, Citric Acid is very bad for you. I urge you to research on the matter to find out for youself
Nooo don’t give up on Diet Coke
you forgot ebola cola
Couldn’t stop starring at Steph’s misplaced hair across her forehead for half the video.
So, if you are going to Germany one day, let me recommend  - Fritz Kola  - Afri-Cola Both, of course, „zuckerfrei“
C: Coke
D: Other - Soft Drink
I actually like the more spicy original cola. Red Bull had it back in the day and I was ADDICTED. I miss it.

7:05 9:05 12:55 3 colas being 7th seeded.... This episode is a disaster...
PSA: Artificial sweeteners are toxic and worse for you than sugar.
C
Now that I think of it big K diet cola (Kroger brand) does have a little bit of a fruity flavor, and I believe it’s just as good or better then Diet Coke.
I've quit diet coke last May and haven't looked back since ❤
Forget zero calories, Dew is where it's at! *MLG AIRHORN*
After years working in the food service where I always had free access to all the diet coke could drink  I was waking up every morning sick to my stomach. I couldn't imagine it was the cause. I changed my diet and did everything I could think of to heal the problem. After I tried everything the last thing it could come down to was the diet coke. It took weeks to go away but it cleared up and has never come back. Long term Diet Coke is poison.
Aspartame you mean cancer causing aspartame!? Pepsi 0 is an out right killer!
I was rooting for it the whole time, as soon as I heard it was the closest store to him I kind of knew
I don’t see Pepsi max
I have been drinking Kroger soda after I switched from diet coke almost 5 years ago. It is rather validating to hear a similar opinion from mattpatt because a lot of people just think I like it because it is cheaper.
I used to work for Kroger. They do own Harris Teeter and I am highly confident that they use the same recipe in both their mainline stores and Harris Teeter. I live in the Northwest US. From what I understand, Kroger actually has their own food labs where they manufacturer a decent sized portion of it's in house brands. I haven't worked there for a few years but that's how it was when I was still present
The problem with store brands is that they are inconsistent.  They'll change their supplier and it can be completely different from one purchase to the next.
I LOVE DIET COKE
Great Value, A NC Food Lion Exclusive but I don't drink Cola so yeah.
they’re so in love
Lol Steph's face
B: Soda or D: bUbblY driNk
I'm sorry, but I just cannot help but laugh at how you two interact! It's honestly amazing to see two souls so bound together, that it's quite literally like you make each other whole.  I'm glad that harmony lit the way for both of you! Still in awe!
This is just epic

When Food Theory becomes Matpat's personal Jenna Marbles style channel
Is diet soda supposed to taste flat?
B.
We have Food Lion in VA
I’m a root beer man. Diet cola is heresy.
I don’t even like diet cola so idk why I’m watching this
Water! Great replacement trust me
flavoured tv static
fizzy drink
It’s pop, period.
look, i work at my local kroger and i don’t even like diet soda in general. but this video got curious. i might have to get one tomorrow when i’m on my lunch break to find out myself😂
The homeless novel rapidly rinse because wasp originally tap notwithstanding a glib death. boiling, bent vacation
Diet coke is gross imo
MatPat right now:  🎵🎶🎵🎶 Hey, all you people Hey, all you people Hey, all you people, won't you listen to me?  I just had a diet cola, it's no ordinary soda A soda from Harris Teeter Grocery!!!!!  Hey, man, you got to try this soda It's no ordinary cola,  it's the tastiest soda in N.C. Yeah!
It seems unfair that the diet coke was the only fountain soda when the rest were bottles or cans.
My poor mom loves diet coke but can't drink it anymore because her kidneys aren't good
He forgot glass bottles
other: " soft Drink"
MatPat looks like WillNE in the thumbnail
as a guy who can't stand any diet soda this has been utterly fascinating truly
can we all agree that diet coke/coke zero well never be beaten?
just drink water  video end
Soda
Dionysus would not be happy
"fountain/post-mix" is thee worst choice if you wont consistency. It all depends on how the machine is maintained and where it is on the "syrup" level. too many drinks have been returned due to the wrong mix of soda water and syrup.  poor choice imo.  FYI: this is coming from someone with a big Pepsi max addiction. I wont buy a bottle of PM that is 2-3 months out from its expiration date due to the taste changing dramatically.
What I learned from this episode is that Matt likes the taste of the sweetener more than the cola.
C
I like coke zero
As someone who grew up a Kroger kid, I always enjoyed many of their Big K brand drinks more than name brand. Same with their off brand cereals. I miss having a Kroger.
Alternate title: FOOD THEORY: Which Cola Soda Is The Best?
hi yes i live in the south and my favorite kind of coke is dr pepper
I grew up in Ohio so I am a pop kinda guy
I’m other   Soft drink down here in Australia
coke zero but no pepsi max .................. boo!!!  ok seems like pepsi zero is pepsi max
Nice try MatPat , nice clickbait
"Fizzy drink" is what you call pop/soda. Brilliant video! Wow! What a result! Didn't see that one coming.
I was surprised that caffeine-free Diet Pepsi won against Pepsi Max/Zero Sugar until I remembered you were a Diet Coke fan and thus the victory of the more watery, tasteless version of the two made sense.
someone, please get mat pat some orange juice, please?
A P O P
Bruh, food lion ia in PA, or atleast mid southern PA
I feel so dumb for liking this so much 🙋🏽‍♂️
OG coke zero is better than coke zero sugar
Mat don't lie. This was just an exuse to drink soda. You too Steph.  *I'm on to you guys.*
As a Canadian, I've always called it A: "Pop"
Makes me wonder where they live because I lived in Davidson for 5 years and Harris Teeter was right down the road and Food Lion was the next town over. Like a 10 min drive.
I’m switching to Pepsi because they aren’t racist 🤟😊
I thought Food Lion and Harris Teeter were universal grocery stores, guess I learned something new today :/
R.I.P. Rank of Diet Coke:  2014-2021
In canada its pop, i dont know what people would say if something like sprites on the menu, would you still ask what kind of coke you want? Cus sprite, and others arent coke
I'm more of a Dr. Pepper guy than diet cola, though that is because I can't find a good sarsaparilla in my area these days. Or any, really.
As Australians we call it soft drink
matpat giving up diet coke?!??! IMPOSSIBLE
Dentists are fuming right now
Boylans other drinks are super good
Switched to kroger cola-oh a couple of years now.. By far the best ever
I have the same cups ( and that all i thought about wille watching this)
I can't speak to Kroger's diet cola, because when I lived near one I was full sugar drinker, but Kroger had some really good store brand products
4:39 "Let the diet cocko beggin"
Whomst've asketh'd?
kroger ad moment
if you call it anything other than fizzy you are wrong.
DR PEPPER
I grew up calling it pop, but switched to soda around the time I turned 19. Not sure what prompted the switch. I moved, but to an area where it's still usually called pop.
Your being racist aginst soda
B) Soda. I understand POP,. because it is Soda Pop, we say the first word, they say the second. Those "call it all coke" people infuriate me.
I really like Wegmans Diet Cola... it doesn't taste QUITE as good as diet coke, but it's pretty close and half the cost
Liars
I was a B/Coke
Vanilla cream soda always the best
I'm not to sure if coke has a glass bottle option for diet but if you ever get ur hands on glass bottle cola it's gotta be the best Also I grew up calling it Pop
I’m from the South and typically use “soda,” but I have legitimately asked a waitress what “fountain drinks” were available; she looked at me like there was something wrong with me.
As a kid, in NY and saw TONS of food lion commercials . Didnt know they were NC based, but that is the only place i have ever been to one.
Diet RC cola
Only mat pat can make drinking diet cola entertaining to me
On film theory can you please do a theory on superjail specifically the warden
The Kroger sodas are awesome. They're called Big K. It's Dr Pepper clone also rocks.
Aldi brand diet cola is the best
Coke is way to acidic... Is diet coke also like battery acid?   I havent had one since I was like 5 so idk. When I ran met dr.pepper.. Thats all she wrote.
I like diet coke cuz its more sweet and stuff
As a southerner, I have never heard it be called "coke" universally.
Diet cola is not really diet
Soda thats what i call it
I kinda wanna see something like this but for lemon lime but there is probably not enough lemon lime to do something like that.
south carolina also has food lion
c
Woah that's like 40% of your personality
Coke 0 for sure
Matpat: very picky with cola Me: *COLA IS COLA*
Dr. Pepper
The only side that is wrong in the pop vs. Soda debate is the people who call it Coke because while a Dr Pepper isn't a Coke both Coke and dr. Pepper are soda pops
And.. what is the theory already?
A
WAIT. MATPAT LIVES IN NORTH CAROLINA?!? I LIVE HERE.
We call it softdrinks in our country.
Huh. *sips diet vernors*
d and b because I used to call it "Special".
I call it soft drink
It's all coke, just different types of coke. Recovering South Carolinian here.
Diet everything is  unhealthy  drink normal soda.  1/10 the amount   I like green tea (all forms). I recently was force to try.  Diet green tea and that made me sick 😷.
MY MAN GOT THAT DIET BIG K
B
A and b north Midwest is wired ok
Me: sees the thumbnail*  Me: also me* wait its not april 1st..!
18:18 to 19:06 the best part the video. It's such Mat and Steph thing to happen.
15:29 While yes it can be very chaotic, as a southerner who grew up in Arkansas, we say soda.
The Fountain drinks will always win the are made better and sweeter on purpose so you’d keep going to restaurant/gas stations etc at least that’s what I think I have noticed all fountain drinks are better than bottle I’d love to see him test it
As someone who loves Kroger diet cola, I feel vindicated
Have you tried beer? Wine?
Hate to say diet is worse for you than regular. Might i suggest something that says zero surgar. Diet has artificial sweetener that is worse for you than real surgar. (disclaimer i usually drink regular so might be lenient to my preference but i’m trying to be health and wellness objective for the sake of this comment)
Crystal Pepsi and Pepsi Clear are two very different drinks.  Both clear. Pepsi Clear is the one that tasted like Pepsi. Crystal Pepsi was...bad.
I didn't see the video I just saw the thumb nail and I'm sorry WHAT!!!!
I love Harris and Teeter, I can find more variety in the super market.
Diet Big K Cola (Kroger’s own) has the citric acid.
pop
Smart
pop
I don't like cola...
A word of advice, never drink Swamp-Pop pure cane cola. Even being made using pure cane sugar, it still terrible. Never try.          Unless it's Ponchatoula Pop Rogue, best flavor in my opinion. Try it whenever you get your hands on some. Or if you're in Louisiana.
R/C for me
My local food lion was turned into a planet fitness
Diet coke is gross anyway
Wait but you tried it right before that’s unfair
Hello, I would like to answer the question and say that I grew up saying coke and not any of the other answers.
WAIT FOOD LION IS ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA???? how have I never noticed that it's literally in non of the other states I've been too????
It's a publicity stunt
Boylan has an amazing rootbeer
Pepsi is pop, everything else is soda
Im from germany so here its Limonade 😅
pop
In New Zealand we just call it "fizzy" or a "bottle of fizz".
I'm soda, mothers Pop, Dads coke, Sister Liquidation
In Georgia we have food lion but its not common
In Australia, we call it either 'Soft Drink' or 'Fizzy Drink'.
Doesn’t he know that diet is worse for you than regular?
D) soft drink
This is hoq you know there a good match 19:00
MatPat, join us in the diet dr pepper cream soda gang, for it is superior.
B
I didnt think this was possible...
Awesome video! If you're ever gonna do something like this again, try to number them 1 to 16 and never find out what's what until the very end
While “Coca-Cola Life” may have a bit of sugar to try to offset the Stevia, Coke does make a sugar-free version. In parts of Europe it has the “life” moniker, while here in Canada it’s just “Coca-Cola Stevia • Zero Sugar/Sucre” and when I tried it I was surprised with how I liked it.  Also Crystal Pepsi made a temporary comeback a few years ago up here as well.
This episode wasn’t even trying to find the best fix for Diet Coke, it was to show why Diet Coke is the best. Nice play matpat nice play
b
Coke
For the people who shop at food lion we can agree that food lion brand sodas has some wired names
Me: (who's guts rebel with every other artificial sweetener except stevia) ..... well then.
I dunno about other countries, but Coke Zero and Coke Zero Sugar are two different products in New Zealand. Coke Zero Sugar is much better IMHO.
If you want something that's very likely similar to the harris teeter, but is much more widely available, try pepsi max, has that exact same citric acid after taste which makes it so good
I honestly grew up on store brand pops and it was a treat to receive name brand when it went on sale. Even though now I tend to buy Pepsi, that is because of its 6 pack of bottles that are great for lunches but if I want a 2L then I go for store brand. Sadly though the cola I love the best is not available close to me as I find I like the Cola that is served on the resorts in Cuba.
My Q is how I can get me hands on that delicious HT diet cola here in Cali. $0.79 a 2 liter bottle! I need it to test against the Ralph's (Kroger) brand here.  MatPat, help a brother out!
Fun fact, Food Lion is also in northern-Central tennessee. I live about 15 minutes away from one
Harris got the drip
Didn’t you already make this video, Matpat?    like... a year ago or so....
I grew up with a mix of soda and pop
Coke Zero is the best!
I'm in VA myself, and do prefer Harris Teeter brand in almost all soda flavors, so I can believe the outcome of this matchup
There used to have Food Lion Stores in North Florida so it was quite nostalgic to hear that name.  I call it soft drinks.
I had no idea for a long time that publix is regional and for those who don't have it I'm sorry
Try rootbeer!
Let me tell you. Florida is the most south-east state. geographically speaking.
Cherry vanilla Coke Zero is my weakness. There was a flavor in 2019 I believe that was orange vanilla (orange creamsicle?) Coke Zero and I *loved* that stuff, but I guess it was just a limited time thing because I haven't been able to find it again.
Steph process who are you and what have you done of my husband at 21:09
Weird 👁
seriously dude, it's about time
i'm a pop from from the North East :)
Orange soda
Diet RC
Is Diet RC not available in NC? If so I'd say it's a sleeper contender
Ok, I think you guys need to investigate citric acid in foods...
I-I never thought it'd happen..
Wait he lives in NC
As someone who hates all types of Coke, I find this intriguing..
I'm from Ohio, I'm a pop guy
I think where I live we just call any sugary, carbonated drink 'soft drink', and then refer to drinks individually by their brand names
stephs face at the end just makes this episode. also i didnt know there was a food theory channel, new sub for you Matpat
I like the coke life. I became fond of stevia when I was growing a Mayan stevia plant. I first broke a fresh leaf off to put in my tea and just used dried when it started to die off.
Soda
imagine harris teeter’s stocks after this video:      /   / /
Soda? Pop? Coke? No no no. Y'all are all wrong. It's a "soft drink."  Think about it. There's beverages with alcohol which are called HARD drinks. They're often carbonated. Therefore, if you make a carbonated beverage without alcohol, it's a SOFT drink.
Best. End Meme. Ever! 😆
Matpat has lost his mind            he'll never leave his brand    will he?
POV: You clicked on this video because it was on your recommended and your drinking a diet coke
Fake sweetner is as bad as any other fake sweetner.  Just drink the Diet Coke.  They’re all poison.
Coke and soda are the same thing
Dr Pepper
Drink sparkling water
B. Soda
Stephaniiiiiiie ♥
Would love to see a food theory about artificial sweeteners and their benefits/downsides
no
Don’t make me take a trip to Maggie valley to get some diet soda and then a trip to Kroger... don’t do it Matt
Ok everyone it's happening everyone calm down
I never liked Diet Coke that much; I’d drink it more as an occasional choice in my early 20s but in the past 5 years I’ve barely touched it.  Prefer orange soda; but Diet flavors I truly like are Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Mtn. Dew.
i am #soda
I never thought the day would come...
If Matt gives up Diet Coke it will be the end for all of us
North Carolina represent
Wish that the Stevia based Zero Calorie recipe for Coke-a-Cola Life had been included which is my preferred zero calorie Coke
I'm a pop person i live in ohio.
Matpat please don't switch from diet coke that Is how I recognized you as a kid
D: mainly water lol
Normal Coke
Im in the east of the US and here we just call it soda nothing special really.
Soda is poison
Tinfoil hat theory: Coke never sponsored Matpat so he dunks on them hard going with the regional brand.
This is what Diet Coke gets for not sponsoring
If you mix citric acid and baking soda you get sodium citrate, the stuff that makes "American Cheese" melt well. Add it to some good cheese and make the best mac n cheese ever :) Or just buy the sodium citrate if you're lazy :P
We got a food lion in VA
Hilarious because everyone’s fighting over whether it’s soda or pop but for me it’s always been soda pop
Mr pibb
Soda fountain drinks vary based on the settings in the dispenser. I would've gone with a can/bottle only competition to reduce that variable.  If the syrup bag is nearly empty you can get too much soda water, if the nozzle isn't cleaned properly you can get too much syrup... there are lots of ways to mess with the mix on soda fountains.
Me  being sad thinking you ment YouTube me like noooooo then you sOdA yeEeEeeeEeeEeeeeE
Me a Brit: OTHER, ITS OBVIOUSLY TEA!
I meaaaaan, considering NC has a ton of soda history I'm not surprised our grocery stores have pretty good off brand sodas!
Could you do this for the fruit flavored sodas?
can you do a electric vs gas powered ovens
I don't drink soda only Dr. Pepper or squirt
Forget it. I'm a Mt. Dew diehard.
I want an uncut version of this!
Coming from Australia - D: soft drink
I don’t think Boylan gets credit over coke for maintaining the recipe consistency considering the original coke recipe was ya know... actual coke!  But still Greta video as always
Matt and Steph are so in sync that neither win at jan ken pon lol.
Wait. Did you guys move to North Carolina?!? Did I miss something?!? If so congratulations! I know you’re closer to family! ♥️
B
What a foodie
I wonder if he is more serious about FNAF lore or Diet Sodas?
I'm a southerner, and I always called it soda. I do live in northern virginia tho, so only kinda south.
So Harris Teeter’d the scales to a MatPat victory?
The uses of coke vs soda vs pop is actually really interesting to me, mostly because I was constantly corrected by one of my friends in college. Both of us are from the same state (WI) and I called it soda while she insisted it was pop. If you look up a map detailing the usage of terms for soft drinks, Wisconsin is actually divided right in half. I grew up in the soda half, she grew up in the pop half.
Why a comparative test and not round robin style?  or better yet, why no metrics with which to measure the quality and taste?
down here, you say sweet tea.
pop
I work at food lion! Heck yeah
I am a water drinker
soda pop
Tbh the Diet Coke from Whole Foods is really REALLY bad
Diet Coke: MatPat, How could you  MatPat: Diet Loser, I mean Diet Coke. Harris Teeter is my Fav...  diet Coke: NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO........
... I sense a disturbance in the force ...
Other: we call it Soft Drink or Fizzy Drink in Australia
Soda, all other answers are wrong.
I'm a coke man , but it is confusing
I Live in North Carolina
Citrus acid is the Krabby patty secret formula
I quit diet coke for close to a decade and then I fell off that wagon hard.
It tastes so bad though
B
I grew up in Nebraska we called it soda
Soda is the only correct term. NOT EVERY SODA IS COKE WHY WOULD YOU CALL EVERY SODA COKE????? IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE
glass bottle Diet Coke is best
Top of the pops
Idk if its regional but Polar makes great soft drinks
Soda
A / B
Why diet soda?  Just drink the regular stuff.  You're more prone to diabetes drinking diet than regular anyway.
In Australia it is called soft drink
I thought no one drank diet coke
Diet Dr Pepper!!!
Diet Coke does not have 0 calories
Y’all food lion root beer is so good
B
WAIT WAIT WAIT are you telling me that food lion and Harris teeter are both North Carolina stores? Why did I not know this
I'm not much of a cola guy, I'm here representing that sprite
B,D
Cancel coke
OTHER: orange juise or gaderade
14:38 don't worry Matt I've heard of it, they're in Tennessee too.
good job
Matpat making an anti-dietcoke title is something I never thought I would see, I am shocked to my very core
I didn’t know that you live in North Carolina
You need to try "manaos" from argentina, is pure ambrosia
The other for me is fizzy drink here in australia
I drink doet soda too cuase normal soda is sweet enpigh to alast me a month. It also makes me sick now
You guys have soda shops? *cries in eu*
I’m surprised Mat pat didn’t get sued
Everything is called coke here in Alabama
Pop
I'm from bc canada POP
Is there something called something

Next time you guys do this you should make sure to rinse with water between sips
I hate Diet Dr.Pepper taste like medicine.
splenda coke sucks
If you put bread with nutella and peanut butter does that qualify as a sandwich 🤨🥪
Anyone know a way us Canucks can get our hands on the winning Diet Cola?  I don't see any one of those stores where i am in Canada.
It’s all called coke
Wait this channel exists?
12:21 is the description to use for Jojo’s adventure or something.
In between tastes you should drink a glass of water and eat a unsalted saltine it cleans your taste palet
try Dr. Pepper & Cream Soda and get off diet.
I'm definetly a soda guy.
Ya boi got on tending let's gooooo!!
Jesus Christ loves you all so very much!! 🥺❤️ But we have to repent of our sins! 🥺🙏🏾✝️  satan loves no one not even himself 👿

Cheerwine!  I mean,it fails all those qualifications,but it's amazing.
I respect you Matt I have no idea how you drink Diet Coke
And When I say Love I mean sTaLkEs Deit Coke.
It’s a
Fizzy
Diet Pepsi
I wish I could attach a picture of my 100oz mug filled with diet coke
You made some mistakes here. Truthfully with the store brands and where they come from. Most people here are fooled daily.
This is MatPats revenge against Diet Coke for never sponsoring him
He stopped his addictions
Wow, this topic exists 🖕🌌😷
this is the definition of clickbait
this episode was on my birthday Poggers!
Fountain is always the best
I say soda and pop
The whole tournament is being held in my state
Anyone else see the PBJ Time banana dancing in the background of the intro? (Around 0:14 )?
I call all sodas coke normally although recently I have been saying soda more  my preferred coke is Pepsi and I dont do diet sodas.
bullshit you actually made this
Where’s my no soda drinking squad?
Before dying of cancer, my mother swore by diet sodas the whole time I knew her. But now it turns out artificial sweeteners don't cause it.
Is Matpat trying to look to get sponsored by a smaller drink company or PepsiCo
100% pop
Whaaaaaat!!!
15:31 me and my family say both, but we say pop for the cans and soda for anything bottled (plastic or glass)
Dr. Pepper 10 calorie isn’t that bad. Or Mr Pibb
There’s already a problem with your metric on the Diet Coke entry… Unless you got it with no ice, the ice:soda ratio and the concentration of the syrup, or even just the end of the syrup bag you get could vary from store to store and visit to visit  Fresh bag of syrup is gonna be way better than the last offerings of a bag and the soda water:syrup balance is then supremely out of whack
in australia we called it soft drink
My area of Australia calls "soda" "soft drink" or I did call it "fizzy" when I was younger ☺️
Fanta is the best.  You’ll never change my mind
A good theory is to figure out if diet soda is any healthier than normal soda
Heretic.
I'm sorry Matt, but nah.  I grew up in the Midwest, and it's always been soda, not pop.
You look and sound exactly like film theory and game theory
I’m soda or soda pop
Shouldn’t be drinking any pop
A
You think it might be hard to get for those who are in other areas of US? I'm not even in US at all!!! XD
11:50 Dad joke No wonder the dad was laughing (alone)
How bout you quit Coca Cola because they are a racist corporation?
im a pop kinda guy. and cordial to me is called squash
Jesus Loves all of you <3
No nuka-cola, its even fruity like Harris Teeter.
Let us bow down to our citris acid overlords
Dr. Pepper is the original soda company....but I digress
B
This video had my like as soon as they mentioned Boylan.
who hasant heard of food lion??? i do live in virginia tho
Matpat: IM LOOKING FOR A SODA TO REPLACE DIET COKE Me: d-drink WATER FATTY
In Australia we say soft drink
Oh boy, if you ever want to drink some fantastic sodas, I recommend guaraná flavored ones, I might be biased but no cola could ever compare to guaraná taste
15:52 battle of the south biggest lie ever Food Lion isnt a south USA brand it isnt even American not suprissed it mayd it this far as it has a huge chain in Belgium called "Delhaize"
Diet Root Beer and Water should be the only two drinks you drink. (Or other weak sparkling water.) Oh - I mean, that is if you care about dental health. Diet Root Beer has one of the closest pH levels to neutral, so it's not going to etch your teeth. Zevia, eh, maybe a close second.
I’m soda
The correct answer is always C: Coke!
We say soda up in New England, but older New Englanders call it tonic.
NC fam!
Spite root beer beer dr.pepper
Stop drinking diet sodas the synthetic sugars in it mess with your brain...stop drinking sodas alltogether
Here in Australia we call it soft drink
Time to try Smith’s store brand cola. For the theorist loyalty!
I’m soda-pop personally
Mat gave up Diet Coke in 2020?! I reintroduced it into my life because of 2020!  You like Fountain best?! That's just wrong!!!!!!  Mat can have Harris Teeter at home & Coke Zero when out.
Pepsi Max is my favourite soda, bar none. Shame it wasn't in this.
After watching Rhett and Link, I'm not surprised at all Kroger won
i’m uh.. fizzy drinks
Harris Teeter is probably going to get a major boost in sales. All by accident. #organictraffic
Unrelated, but I'm going to North Carolina next week.
This is literally a diet coke advertisement
When I saw this video I was like..... CLICK BATE
its b soda
I call drinks like these soft drinks
Hey MatPat could you make a food theory about caffeine and ADHD? I bring this up because I want to know the science behind how caffeine helps calm people with ADHD instead of makes them hyper like normal people. I should know I have ADHD myself.
The Cinderella Story turns into the upset of the century!
Hey, you may not have this there but try glass Diet Coke I personally think it is better thanks
a better way to have done this is use a water bottle thats colored so you can't see the color only the flavor.
But how can something so unhealthy be the god’s chosen beverage
you forgot bang cola
FINALLYYYYY
im an other kinda guy i call them just fizzy drinks because idk if to call it coke or what because fanta isnt a cola like coke/cocacola n stuff
Just went to Harris Teeter just to get the drink to try it! Will comment back after I try it!
Haven’t seen the video yet, but I would like to point out that the thumbnail has matpat pouring a soda onto himself
I bet you some day I will do this but with root beer 🍻
SHIII BRO MAT GAVE UP DIET COKE
did you know that the secret recipe to the krabby patty is actually cocaine yes cocaine search it up on google
I- no, not the nectar of the gods
I’m sorry to see you guys split apart. :(
B!!!
If they didnt drink water in between each match the results may vary
Here in the UK it's always coke.
You should try store brand cereal
Apparently people in the us don’t know Aussies call Soda soft drink or fizzy drink
Montecello Root Beer is the best drink I've ever drank. Its hand made in Virginia with vanilla and a bit of honey and its *amazing*
Burn no @brit  animations
I've seen a comment, but real life Krabby Patty!!
I call carbonated beverages of all varieties "FIZZY DRINK".
as a diet sam's cola addict, I have been waiting for this video for longer than I wish
You should totally drive around America testing diet colas coast to coast
To quote Fallout 4: Drink. Some. Water.
Me, who is Dutch: Fresh drink.(Frisdrank)
In Mexico we call them Refresco, which would roughly translate to ‘I refresh’. I’ve heard some call them Chesco (A sort of nickname for Refresco), Gaseosa (Which means Gassy) and Soda too.
diet soda not good man I am sorry
other: beverage cause i’m european
Hate to say it but it's all bad for you. Diet soda, regular and anything with carbonation. Carbonation blocks your bodies ability to absorb calcium. Sorry club soda drinkers
I haven't drink soda for a year and 3 months 20 days
I gave up soda all together kind of since I realized how much mountain dew i drink in a day almost a whole big bottle of it or sometimes I drink 2 big bottles of it .So now I basically drink it only during gaming sessions not when there isn't one.
Never have I ever been so invested in the diet coke anime tournament arc Crazy how THAT character  won in the end
I call them soda pop
eum... Foodlion is an international Belgian store. It's called Delhaize here and they're in multiple countries including the USA ;)
We need a theory on nofrills anime
Fun fact fot matpat: in louisiana and maybe other states we call soda soft drinks
Here in Europe Food Lion is called Delhaize, and it’s pretty much everywhere lol
Someone should of sneaked in some Chinotto. Would of love to see Matt's reaction.
As someone who doesn’t really like diet sodas, Coke Zero is close enough to the real thing.
Haha, you chose an interesting sentence before your outro catch phrase, it sounded like you were saying "it might be a while before Steff and i pick up another soda, but hey that's just a theory" 😁
Oooh, we got Food4Less and FoodsCo here in California. I might have to check that diet cola out.
Fizzy drink
D. Soft drink
You should try tea that is sweetened with stevia.  It's the only way I like stevia. (The tea that I like is a deserts line up of teas like apple pie or blubbery muffin)
Dababy
try doctor peppier
A
Water for The Win!
Great, now teach my mom please.
I can’t believe Harris Teeter won I guess my state likes its cola
I've always been told to say away from diet soda because it contains aspartame, a 'dangerous'* substitute (*I put dangerous in quotes because I'm not entirely sure if that's true). So is diet soda really that bad or have I been misinformed?
I live in an area that has a lot of Fred Meyer stores; the soda in question will be Big K Cola. The regular Big K Cola taste very similar to pepsi. Diet Big K Cola is very nice!
When I was a kid I would call it pop, but as an adult I call it soda, so make of that what you will.
food lion over kroger any day. kroger has a bad habit of making all of their produce moldy before it leaves the store since they spray it all with water every few minutes
I got one Diet Pepsi
Matpat!  You've become everything you swore to destroy!!!
uh, u missed a big one, diet coffee candy
I use to live like 5 min from a Food Lion before Brookshires took over the building
TIL GAME THEORY has another channel
My only woe in life is the fact that there aren't any Harris Teeter stores near me. T_T
ICE sparkling water doesnt taste like diet. Lots of flavors.
Matpat: I gave up Diet Coke for 2020.   November's Hot One's episode: *Drinks Diet Coke.*
Yeah the stevia in the Zevia cola is WAY to overpowered. In all the other ones, it is way better.
I can't believe you didn't try the Mexican glass-bottled Coca Cola Light lol Has the BEST flavor
Coke
please make the trip oh my god
WHYYYYYYYYY DIET COKE WAS YOUR IDLE YOUR REASON FOR LIVING
Soda all the way, I have always seen pop as a british thing. I have never heard coke as a blanket term
I would love to give you feedback on local soda but 1) I hate carbonated beverages and 2) I live in New England and I don't think I saw any of the stores that we have up here in your list.  Oh well!  Still fun to watch!
B
I call it soda but my grandma called it soda water  Now she called it soder
Me drinking Diet Coke watching this 😶😳
soda is the past. tea and coffee are the future.  ... and the past.
I used to drink a lot of soda, mainly diet coke. For Spanish class, to observe Lent, I gave up soda, just went to drinking water (I did mess up once, getting a fountain drink from a restaurant without thinking). I was planning to go back to drinking soda, but I didn’t miss it as much as I would of thought, so I sticked with water. Now I enjoy the occasional soda when the urge arise, mainly sugar filled sodas, as they taste so much sweeter when your tastebuds aren’t used to them.
does pepsi max exist in the US? did i miss it somewhere or was there a reason it didnt show up?
A similar thing happened to me yesterday as in this video. I was buying 4 sodas for a game night with friends and mainly getting the popular choices like Coke, Sprite, and Barq’s. My last pick was a random one I had never tried but sounded good: Fanta Mixed Berry. To my complete surprise it was extremely good and the 4 of us completely guzzled it down in no time flat.
SODA STRWAM
D
coke zero is the best
I lived next to a food lion when i was a little kid, it was weird when I moved out west and didn’t see one.
Turn on captions at 3:45
I like Sprite Zero
James (TheOddOnesOut) should do a collab with TFT (The food theorist)
Nothing says more about their relationship than those rock paper scissors matches
C for Coke forever baby!
Legit surprised he didn't hit up a Walmart and grabbed a Great Value brand diet soda.
Coke zero, (its the same as diet coke)
Steava tastes like crap
I literally gasped at the title
Diet pop is ugh that fake aspartame aftertaste ‘bleeg‘ anyone who says you can't taste the difference is fricking lying to themselves or has no sense of taste.
I grew up with "pop" but I prefer to say "soda" because it just makes more sense to me.
Diet water
My kind of video! I live and die for soda!
Diet coke and Matt Pat, name a more iconic duo.  I’ll wait.
Sodapop
sodapop or just pop for me
Well I’m only 13 but you probably shouldn’t say that Harris teeter is the closest store to your house I looked up where he lives and it said in west lake California and if that’s true there is only one Harris teeter their so people can get a pretty good idea as to where you live by  Idk maybe I’m overthinking the whole thing
Not a fan of diet cola. I find that they usually have a bad aftertaste and leave your tongue wanting.
Mat: “Are you Pop, Soda, Coke or other?” Me: "Soft drink, Minerals..."
You missed Aldi store brand summit

Kiwi fructonic
I’m glad your obsession to over analyze everything takes away this little joy of your life
if you were to try HEB Coke i think it would’ve won but it’s a texas only chain
Pepsi and Boylan were both 7th seed
I stop drinking fizze sodas and fizze drinks it is going to be 6 years in may
Food lion is also in virginiq
How about some egg juice?
Weird watching matpat sniffing coke
as a huge classic coca cola drinker I should really do the same thing myself with standard cola to see if theres a secret favorite I don't know about at the local stores
Please just drink water it's nothing but health hazards in soda
I can't believe how invested I was in watching mat pick his favorite diet coke.
I'm a D: other kid.     D: euphoria
Fountain drinks are always best version of a drink.
number 8 is how coke (and a lot of sodas) used to taste.
Mat-Pat has betrayed us.
D fizzy
I replaced sodas with Polar seltzer water.
Btw, cherry chocolate diet Dr pepper would've beat them all out....i miss it.
I gotta go with #3
Im a pop
COKES ARE HARD ON KIDNEYS THEY MAKE KIDNEY'S SLOW
I was more surprised that mat chose soda fountain over can and plastic bottle
Harris teeter straight up posted like swag goku all the way through
Masterpiece
my minds just blown that MatPat has a hot wife
And this is why we're getting divorced, Your Honor.
WOOOOO DIET PEPSI!!!!!!!!!!!
You should've let your son break the tie 😆
I'm more of a Dr pepper and cherry coke guy
I can’t believe a childhood of free cookies at Harris Teeter had me cheering for Harris Teeter after moving to California XDXDXDXD
DO A CHEERWINE EPISODE  #NC
It's kind of funny how MatPat has been raving about Diet Coke for years now, and it is FatPat's favorite drink, but his favorite cola that trumped Diet Coke was located at the closest grocery store to their house. XD
In Canada, we call it pop. Not SODA, not even SODA POP. Just, pop. And we have Wal Mart, but none of the other places mentioned. However, seeing as I'm an A&W Root Beer -slash- Cranberry Gingerale guy, and don't hold with all this sissy DIET/ZERO/STEVIA nonsense, I didn't actually care who won March Matness. I was just looking to fill some time on the bus.
wait wouldn’t the straw mess with the flavor?
Hey Matt and Steph! Got an idea for a video!  "Can you out-pizza the hut?"
Wait, matpat is located in NC? I've been maki g frequent trips to NC without this knowledge??
It's soda all the way. I was born and raised in Georgia. Never heard anyone call soda coke.
I mommy approves this
Do a theory on EAT:the revolution fell like it has a lot of lore about uncle hunger and his evil plans . :note egg carton might be decodable .also you have to play for around 5mins then swipe it out repeat that a few times and then you’ll start seeing that you are weirder and weirder every time! #theory
Rock, paper scissors is an evil game. Although in my youth it was called quartz, parchment, shears.
What's up with the over exposure
Here's a food theory: the aspartame is diet drinks is slowly embalming your guts.
MATPAT LIVES IN NC?   No wonder I can relate so much with his IRL adventures/antics in his more recent videos.
Also Kroger died years ago in the first decade of the 2000s there may only be one left, and I haven’t seen one in at least 10 years
Why not drink Diet Pepsi?
Coke (but i put soda on grocery list)
Matpat I’m an call of duty player
Fritz Cola!!!
fizzy drinks is what i call it
The end of an era😭😂
The sheer SHOCK on Steph's face is absolutely priceless
Mr D would be dissiponted in you   (only percy jackson fans wil get this refrence)
Wait the ex-6th largest military was beaten by a measly north Carolinen supermarket brand
The Thumbnail got me like "MatPat is doing WHAT?" First JL SC and now this. *clicks play button*
What about dehydrated water???
My wife likes the Bubbly brand flavored sparkling water, I only drink coffee, tea, and water.  Soda is really bad for you, diet or not.
It’s soda because it isn’t restricted to a brand, also pop is the Improper Queens English
I will say Food Lion does make a good diet cola
But hey that is just a theory
soda
correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't some store brand packed by name brand companies?
coke zero taste better then diet coke
E
WAIT FOODLIONS REGIONAL I THOUGHT IT WAS EVERYWHERE
All that Aspartame and phosphoric acid really does a horrible thing to your gut microbiome.... Stop....lol
doctor pepper
I was given a 12 pack of Diet Coke for Christmas.  Diet Coke is Life.
Interchangeably A & B
Pepsi for life
Soda YEP and yep I used to be Diet Coke, your research is interesting indeed
We call it soda-pop since some people don’t understand pop.
Diet Coke is so bad for you
I know this only a Michigan thing but Faygo diet or not is good...
Fountain coke always tastes better to me  Also, at 8:48, Antiqology is in my hometown of Huntington, Indiana! They have hundreds of craft and glass bottled soda varieties and the ice cream is amazing!  A) POP!
"We came in search of copper, but we found gold."
I thought his was gonna be something about the health effects of Diet Coke consumption, but no, MatPat wants to see if he can out-Diet Coke Diet Coke. You go dude
I feel like this test is still biased just because you still know that one cola has to be diet coke, so your bias can still win out because you're looking for coke flavor specifically. Instead of a blind bracket, you should have a double blind bracket, meaning you don't even know which soda's are placed where on the bracket, meaning you couldn't possibly be looking for coke flavor in any particular instance
In Wisconsin it's SODA. In Minnesota it's POP. Soda for the win.
Ok I live in NC and I have never heard of a Publix
Wait in the US you call it “Pepsi zero sugar” we call it “Pepsi max”
Good he quit 1 because coke is racist 2 diet coke is bad for you
A great Cola drink with stevia is Green Cola, personaly I like it better than the OG CocaCola
Now I gotta try that Harris Teeter Diet Soda... I guess I have to go to Ralph’s lol 😂
soda
I grew up in Ohio and it was “pop” growing up.  I started calling it “soda” in my 20’s because I was tired of people being confused when I’d say “pop” and thinking I said “pot”.  Now, at 38 almost 39, it feels weird to say pop.
Jesus Christ loves you
OBVIOUSLY COKE AM I RITE FELLOW BRITS
So kinda a side thing and this may be opinion...I think Fountain Soda always tastes better then Can or Plastic/Glass bottle. My thought on why this is...is that with Fountain Drinks it's mixed right there and then as you pour it. With Bottle and Can it's mixed before hand and then sealed like that till it's open meaning it sits around for longer. So with fountain you're basically getting "Fresh" soda.
coke zero coke zero coke zero :>      i drink coke zero alot cause its my favorite drink and i dont like water
Little secret... Shasta is bottled by Coca-Cola. And Coke will cease bottling by the fall of 2021.
Napój gazowany :3
I can attest to the soda sources tasting different for even regular coke
Nooooooooo
Never thought I would see the day where Mat Pat quits Diet Coke 🙌
Mat pat:( you could have went to a McDonald’s and they have the Coca Cola machines ALL THE FLAVORS and the cups are 1$ + tax
The editing in this video is so funny!
Or you know... take a Diet Coke and put a slice of lemon in it
Just call up Dr pepper hes a doctor
if your childhood was bad enough, THATS gonna leave a mark, NO DIET COKE!
🇺🇸 moment
I'm a soda person 😅
Also, I prefer all soda from glass bottles, always tastes better
Irn bru
I'm pretty sure everyone feels this way but having Steph on the channel make food theory the best one.
lacroix
It has always been called coke around here, even Diet Tab is called coke. "I would like a coke." "What kind?" "Regular Coca-Cola." "We only server Pepsi products here." "Tea then." "Sweet or unsweatened?" The only tea you get in the South is iced. So Matt picked Diet Coke with citric acid instead of phosphoric acid.
14:25 Nice editing
omg diet coke is so disgusitng normal is better.
Food theory: Diet Coke is less healthy than regular coke.   Just drink Mexican Coke man. Real sugar no corn syrup.
Me: *sees title* Oh, I highly doubt that.
What an upset
I AM COKE
I call it soft drinks
You should not have revealed the brand after each round because than it would be more objective but hey, very nice video :)
Soda
Any aspartame is going to work on pickling you, it has the same chemical structure as embalming fluid.  Also canned is better than bottle in my opinion, fountain is middle
I can not believe this happened.
They say drinking diet coke is bad for your brain. No wonder MatPat made the Sans is Ness video!
This was anime level good.
Im addicted to bubly, I prefer it over a soft drink and there is 0 sugar
Am I the only one who thought that Food Lion was just a know store?
we call it soda
@mattpat Faygo isn't sold down there?
It go’s can of coke >fountain coke>bottle of coke  that’s just how it is 🤷🏻‍♀️😊
Food Lion was around in Virginia when I was a kid
In germany we just say cola
this is biased as heck. haha wtf
This follows the same pattern as the Find the Brand Name game on Good Mythical Morning: Kroger-brand stuff is surprisingly delicious and Whole Foods is completely terrible.
NC?! Awesome!  Gotta be Sam’s cola. And in a can.
ayo, I think I found the harris teeter near MatPat's house. It's in Durham on Hillsborough road.
I always called it soda pop like I could pick so I called it both
Diet coke addicts anonymous  DCAA
I usually rise my mouth with water or eat a snack between beers when tasting them, so the flavor of the previous drink does not affect the one I am about to try!
I'm with you fountain diet coke.
No
Orange Fanta best soda
WALMART FROZEN CHICKEN NUGGETS 😂😂 they are amazing
Title: I QUIT Diet Cola. Video: Diet Cola connoisseur.
Matpat: Kroger me:low Low low low low low low low low
https://youtu.be/hmcEVCHcPz8
pop
I say Soda but also, we say fizzy not carbonated. Does anyone else say fizzy?
Mat pat did you film the hot ones episode like in 2019 because if you didn’t then you had drank cola in 2020.
Diet Coke:HEY mapat we want to make a game theory diet coke but you gotta some  Matpat: 😰. Im sorry **bass booted NO**
i was drinking 2 liter/day of coca cola ( regular )... i did stop 2 years ago ... did try the diet one .. it seem i dont digest aspartame ( give me headache ) . quitting coca cola was one of the best move in my life ..... still love it but dont buys it anymore.
15:31 GAZIRANO PIĆE- means soda
This is discrimination if they used fountain Coke Zero it would win hands down
I can't quit diet coke if I don't like it. I'm weird :)
When did he move to NC??
you need to go to rocketfizz with that addiction lol.
I would pay large amounts of money to see the cashiers faces when MatPat does the shopping for these videos.
Soda Pop
Water steel
That company probably doubled their worth with the release of this video xD
where is the Theory ? i thought this is The Food Theorists channel not Good Mythical Morning
The holy pepsi is the answer
I have the same level of hype for this as for when Dream does his face reveal
I lived in North Carolina for 7 years and never in that time did I know they had a Publix up there
Wow, I've never seen a picture of him so sad.
you know i could see that moment of cognant dissonance when matt was like, "but i like number one. this one cant win. but it is good..." in the final.
Aha! I found out what the secret ingredient in spongebob's craby paties are, citric acid!
North Carolinian here! I used to get scolded for calling a drink "soda" - apparently, only yankees can call it that. For the most part, my family uses either the universal "coke" or "soft drink".
I like diet coke just not addicted
When I saw the title I was like "Who is he, and what has he done with MatPat?"
Who’s else’s mouths dropped when they saw the title
A
Every now and then, taking from my Italian Great-Grandmother and Italian Grandfather, I’ll call a carbonated soft drink a “sodie”/“sody.” Otherwise, growing up in the Northeast in Connecticut, wedged between NYC & Boston, we fervently call our soft drinks “soda.”
I'm doing something similar except I can't play video games video games and not watch videos for 40 days
Coke with Stevia was good but they discontinued it because of Covid. Pissed me off so much I emailed Coke about it. They sent me a coupon for a free 2L bottle.. >.> Still miss Coke Stevia.
Question is that mean that your going to change all of those Coke jokes in your previous videos and change them to other drink
Cola
C:coke
It’s too bad that you guys aren’t in Connecticut in the New Haven Area eating pizza from Wooster Street. Foxon Park is the local cola of choice here (bottled on the Foxon/New Haven/East Haven line), it’s inspired by Italian flavors if you’re looking for something besides cola flavor (Grassola is a unique flavor they have), and I promise you it’s better than Coke, Pepsi, or any other brand of Cola. It’s always a treat when you get a glass bottle or glass cup of Foxon Park, you won’t regret it.
Mine is Coke Zero, tried the other brands we got here in Italy and they're not as good. But if I ever go to America I'll try out the stores there, might find the one.
D: Sodee-Pop
18:08 is it 13th or 10th
As someone in the opposite corner of the country everything you described in the teater soda is everything my brother loves about our big k diet coke soda here
Pop
I heard replacement for soda and only though TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA!
It goes outside your rules so I know why it wasn't on your bracket  but my favorite pop is Coke Zero orange vanilla It's impossible to find right now but I LOVE it
Matt's a Teet man
Diet is more unhealthy than regular. I recommend rc
the food lion store is actually an American subsidiary of the Belgian Delhaize group stores
Not gonna lie I didn’t know he liked Diet Coke until now
Great... now I wanna try Harris Teeter soda and I do not live anywhere one... 😩
I call it pop but in Scotland we call it coke or “fizzy drink”.
why? why?!?!?!?!
B:Soda
Finally, someone else who consumes copious amounts of carbonated beverages
I call all my caffeine drinks : coffee, beer, and Spicy Water
sodas that mean cola won
I dont know if it is in the states but here in Canada alot of times the bigger companies make the store brand items with slight differences .
I agree with the thoughts about Stevie it has a flavor while I don't mind the flavor it has a place and feels more like a sweet spice for me
Im waiting for a Chubbyemu video
I don't drink soda and I never have, but I love stevia as an option to make sweet tea. I prefer how it tastes to sugar
Me when I see the title: *Impossible*
I haven’t drank soda in 9 years, that’s when I quit. Seltzer is great
you gringos are weird
This is a theory...
Personally I call it soda. Also I don't drink diet sodas, but on the topic of sodas in general, pepsi is definitely my go to. It's got a nice sweetness that I like (and several of my family say is TOO sweet), and it's consistent among all forms. Can, plastic, glass, and fountain, and it doesn't change drastically between warm and cold. I used to drink 4-6 cans a day, but after looking after my health, it's down to 2 or 3 (rarely), one for each meal.
Citric Acid: The secret ingredient in the Krabby Patty.
Why am I watching this? I don't even like soda, well for the exception of the Canada Dry Green Tea soda but that's more to do with liking tea a lot.
I'm only at the 4:33 mark but I want to interject that y'all should have included Diet Coke from a GLASS bottle. Glass bottle coke is the best coke.
Canada: it's pop. I've never met any other Canadians who call it "soda"
Heard it called "pop" when I was little and around relatives from up further north, but where I live it's almost universally called soda for those I have been around.
Soda
Plot twist it’s Pepsi Max
Pop
Can you do a episode on irn-bru there’s 32 secret flavours
Matpat is now out of the Diet Coke phase and in the Harris Teeter phase.
this might be a request by MatPat to virtually return to the Mystical studio :D
if it's a DIET soda I'll drink it, except for diet 7up lemon lime just abit too sour & I'll never drink diet root beer I tried regular years ago hated it so I WON'T/EVER try the the diet version
B
Other: FIZZY DRINK as it should be called, In england
It's pop in all of Canada as far as I know. At least it is in Nova Scotia.
2 mil already
In Yorkshire, England, we call carbonated soft drinks "pop".
Actually I thought good lion was everywhere
Steph is so right. i live in Kentucky but have lived in, tn, and nc also. the south (ky and tn) almost everyone says coke for all soft drinks. "hey what cokes you got?" "i got sprite, dr pepper, and coke." where as nc and in i heard pop or soda more. it still varied based on the person and where they were from origninally.
Omg, only the poor British kids know the pain of being stuck with Rola Cola😂😭😭
Coke Zero is my #2 with Diet Coke being #2. However I am definitely going to try Kroger's now that I have seen this.
well Kroger's brand defiantly shows citric acid in there diet cola https://www.kroger.com/p/big-k-diet-cola/0001111049684 to bad not in their regular one does not. also I agree with Steph I hate drinks with stevia, I cannot stand the weird taste of it.
coke zero gang
Soda is mid west
South africa: Cool Drink
Soda pop over here in the west
This is content for children. Bye.
Any fountain drink is inconsistent and it's execution particularly with McDonald's who does not use the proper ratio of syrup to soda water in any fountain. therefore any fountain diet cola must be eliminated from this tournament. Your views were already skewed and the scientific process is null and void.
Who knew the massive companies who specialize in cola won against the lesser known colas
I’m not even concerned anymore
And some day. Can you test Swedish Candy. PLZ😃
Drink Canada dry it really taste good or maybe Coke LOL ha ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah Hah
I am B. Wee call it soda in Sweden or in Swedish  wee call it läsk.
Your not wrong.  I work in coffee production. Mother Parkers is the company i work for.  Now you May of never heard of it but i know you have heard of our customers. Walmart, Duncan Donuts, 7-11 and Burger King are just the big ones that come from my plant alone.
I have the attention span of a goldfish and your video kept me engaged the whole time. Congrats, also going to go get some private label diet soda from my local store, big YEET
Pepsi max?
I am coke guy
Also it makes perfect sense that the one with more citric acid won. You ever tried Diet Coke mixed with lemonade?
If Mat Pat can quit Diet Coke, you can quit anything.
People who call soda pop can’t be trusted
I have lived in North Carolina all of my life and I call soda soda because orange soda is not coke.
Wait, why isn't pepsi in this edit: nvm I watched till the end now...
Harris Teeter's needs to give you a big thank you and check because their business must be booming after you posted this.
Coke
SPRITE
i am a coke zero person
Haris teeter representing the east coast
I like any Diet Coke, Cola or Dr. Pepper
I don't call it soda, pop or coke/cola, I call it "fizzy". Like, at the weekends I'd ask my mum "Can I have some fizzy" or just the name of the drink, which is normally Fanta or Tango.
C
I entirely forgot that you were born in/ live in North Carolina. I find it funny because last I heard, Mr. Beast was there. I also find it a little funny because I was born there, but my pollen allergies forced me to move here to Menan,Idaho. So my two most favorite  Youtubers live at my birthplace... Huh neat...
I've tried to quit half a dozen times with no success.  So, good luck to you Mat Pat I hope you succeed.
That’s not a theory.. that’s torture.
Combine them
Combine them
"never heard of Food Lion." Too many in Maryland. More than Harris Teeter
I was drinking a Diet Coke while watching this
What would be the canadian equivalent to krogers I wonder
This is a great example of why I stopped watching all of Matts Theory channels. There is a lot of 'information' that goes no where, the last couple of minutes was actually interesting (the part about branding), but that's out of a 24 minute video. I decided to watch this one as I don't like to dip and not give a person another chance; I had stopped consuming his content over a year ago, and it seems the process has not changed much. Inaccurate titling as to what's actually going to transpire, lots of ego flex, bombastic placed moments with voice overs, etc. - I feel like I'm watching reality TV with a production team of one or two actors. To give a food analogy, it's the same feeling I get after eating a big mac, it may have been somewhat tasty, but it's still junk food and I am left empty afterwards. One can only watch an ego perform to this extent for so long.
Florida is not part of the south
I call it soda-pop so it’s a little bit of everything
NO! DIET COKE IS BASICLY A PART OF MATPATS PERSONALITY! :( please don't quit a part of your personality.
Why does he look like Cody Ko?
My grandparents live in North Carolina and when Matt said you probably haven't heard of Food Lion I laughed
how r planning on consistently stockpiling fountain coke if it wins
Here in Britain we call fizzy drinks poppin soda fizzy imeey matie unie cola dola mola eyy o muate
i exopected he was sponcerd by no.1 place and he realised it was best and made ths if not he sponcerd for free
I'm other:  I say "drink"  (I'm in the Ohio Valley region)  This video proves that you and Steph would be great wine tasters.  "This one had a unique blend, and it lingers."
Actuslly seeing your face is totally throwing me off. Im so used to seeing a still picture of you that this is gonna take getting used to.
Diet Dr. Pepper hits differently man! I really love it, and Dr. Pepper deserves your loyalty. Maybe, try zero?
I never thought i would see the day where Mat would've prefer anything but diet coke....are you okay Mat?🙃
I need that here in the Philippines, I wanna taste it, I'm too addicted to coke zero and coke regular dkxkkdksmd
Yes! I use to say, "I'll have a medium coke, Dr. Pepper please." I now call it soda after moving to other cities because people would just serve me coke or say, "So, do you want coke or Dr. Pepper?"
.
Imagine someone offering you a coke and they hand you a grape soda.      I don't have to because I've lived in Alabama.
almdudler is the best fizzy drink in the world imo. (it's from Austria)
The reason the fountain tastes sweeter is because of sugar mould build up in the fountain
hey and manaos??' jajaja
D. here in iowa, calling it soda or pop is the same XD
You quit diet coke? I don't believe you.
They shouldn't know what they're drinking going into it. Just drink and check which is best
Make a theory on willys wonderland
Growing up between Missouri and Kansas, we called it soda, not pop
Who are you, and what have you done with Matpat?
I've been watching this dude for to long. I'm actually invested in him selecting the wild card
Soda
Soda~
You guys are lucky you don't live in the uk. Our shop brand cola is just off enoug for them to only be good with bacardi
For some reason this is giving me early 2000/90 tv vibes
Oh I hate soda stream it tastes so horrible   But I love zero pepsi even if I die quicker due to health
lmao the grocery stores after the million of people that watched this edit: bad english sorry
Soda's got talent
WHAT
come to Georgia we are home to the world of coke you dont know what amazing flavors your missing out on
Drink
Pepsi
It so sad he Switching sodas because any jokes would not really be that funny
So basically this video is about which Coke they prefer to get addicted to
B
How about not drinking pop...
also +1 for a private label show! i buy food lion brand stuff alll the time. my parents brought me up on fruit rings and apple dapples
I’m just glad Coke Zero got to the finals because it’s my favourite soda of ALL TIME so yeah
I usually say pop and soda.
Totally biased because I work at a harris teeter, but I've never found a better in store brand
15:28 Sometimes B, more oftentimes C. But actually D.   Sopdrengks
i want to taste those cokes now
Never knew food lion was from NC, and I live here, lol. Also b: soda.
Well im D I grew up in germany, so I say „Koffeinhaltiges Erfrischungsgetränk“
THE ARMAGEDDON IS HAPPENING
I got super surprised when I heard food Lion because I live here in Virginia and I thought it was a Virginia thing because you can't go too long of distances without finding a food Lion
Go love mountain dew
Bruh no one asked about this
Well technically aspartame has been proven that it could cause damage to your system in which I’ve even met a few people who has had gotten something bad from it from drinking or eating too much of it
pop and I stand by it. calling it coke is just madness and confusing
Impossible!
Me who lives in europe: interesting...
Here in Britain (puts on British accent) we call it fizzy drinks and or soda, and most people say coke
I LOVE Harris Teeter
Ok so I tried it today and it's pretty much what he said. It has a good aftertaste and it isn't too sweet. I could only find it in cans so I had a bit of trouble tasting it so I just poured it in a cup. Mine says diet cola instead of zero calories but there's no calories on the back so I guess it's the same. I also get a bit of a cotton candy kind of aftertaste but might just be me.
Kroger: STONKS!!
Honestly I haven't tried diet stuff yet... I do sprite. No hate replies plz
Pop gang
I wonder how he feels about the Diet Coke flavored products, like when they added citrus flavors
why bro its so good at destroying scovile
In Nigeria we call it Minerals
Wait what about the variability in fountain and soda stream drinks? Their ratios can vary right? Doesn’t that skew things?
B
11:47 surprised you weren’t able to make a Shasta McNasty reference here. Am I the only one who remembers the early 2000s?
What if game thory made a secret story, who would solve it XD
I mean cola was just cough syrup sweetened and fizzy
Pop
My favourite is Pepsi Max
Definitely dont drink too much coke sodas, but if you ever want to try different tastes from around the world go to LasVegas Coca-cola world it's pretty cool, I used to work there but now i dont :< (By the way there are only 16 flavors on the tray but definitely a unique experience)
In England we just call “pop” or “soda” a can of (then the name of the drink) or we just call it a fizzy drink
Just have some McDonald Sprite. Everyone knows that it hits different. But HEY! THATS JUST A THEORY, AAAAAAA FOOD THEORY
Water would have won easely
Drink. Some. *Water.*
The first thought I had when i saw the title is “this is cursed”
Every time matpat drinks a can ove diet coke he get  1 power also mat pat my pawer is over 9000
Grew up in Oklahoma but i always called it pop
☕Coffee Break☕
dis is end of the COKE ADDICSION huh
Have you heard the word about Bawls
Good job on #29 trending!!!!
living in NC my whole life, Food Lion is my main grocery store, it’s interesting to think that people haven’t heard of it lol
15:29 Other ,  I call it Carbonated Colored Sugar Water with added flavor
Aren't fountain sodas sometimes slightly different?  Depending on mixture of the syrup used.
"You've probably never heard of food lion" jokes on you Matthew I was in North Carolina for a month and went there like twice.
how many times in round 1 did “7th seed” appear?
i can concur that Kroger is indeed suppling most stores with the same soda i have a smiths nearby that sells cola oh it is very much how you described it but this requires more research
I quit drinking all soda 5 years ago but what I could never quit is this https://youtu.be/V1rq1hcIbuU
MatPat overcame his racism?!
Wow dude. Apartame isn't as bad as you are making it out to be. It had the potential to cause cancer years and years down the road. You know what else can cause cancer? The sun. You are a lot more likely to get skin cancer from the sun than developing cancer drinking diet soda with aspartame. I dont think you should scare people into not drinking it. It is a lot better and healthy than drinking regular pepsi or regular soda. Studies show diet soda leads to weight loss not weight gain. Diet soda also allows you to feel a little better about your diet. I know you have talked about making a fitness and health theory Channel, but dont if you are going to try and scare people with facts that aren't true due to misinformation spread around everywhere. Just drink your diet coke.
(:
In New Zealand we call "soda" Fizzy, because well... it's fizzy, has fizzy bubbles, feels fizzy in your mouth, so... Fizzy
Not only that. It's been known that they use. Secret formula HEK 293
I’ve lived in Georgia all my life and I’ve only ever heard it called soda until a few years ago. Never called all soda coke cause that’s just one type from a specific brand... and also I’d never heard of poop until recently
So sorry u gave up sat diet but there still coke from 90th century
me: laughs in original taste coke
Regular diet Pepsi is aspartame free.....
Am i wierd to like diet monster?
im morre of a soda guy myself
0-0 i am umm aaaaaa  wowww
uk so its fizzy
24:01 Nice meme. You are holding a Diet Coke with your wife, and you saw another girl holding Harris Teeter, the winner of the challenge.
I just love how their brains are so in sync that they tie 6 consecutive times on rock, paper, scissors
Why are they surprised the old cola tasted like cough syrup lol isn’t that what coke used to be for? And especially if they haven’t changed their recipe in over a 100 years lol
MatPat is racist.
C
chemically diet coke is far worse then regular
Mom found out the aspartame in her diet drinks were what was killing her eyesight and if she continued, she'd be blind by age 40. She's 49 now and last I knew, she could still see but she also quit that day. Also Edit: I work at Food Lion (or will up until next saturday: yay! Bank job and a proper living!) I will probably forever praise their food and deals because they're actually good. Like you don't have to buy 10 of something if the sale is buy 10 for $10, you can just get 1 for a buck and keep on with your life. Will not praise their work ethics though.
Personally, all diet soda is really gross. They put way too much of the sweetener in there. The is also always a gross aftertaste.
15:16 as someone from the Midwest  (Wisconsin) i have never met someone who says pop over soda
what if all this time MattPatt was being sponsored by diet coke and that is why he mentions it in any video but they cancelled the sponsorship so Matt Patt is taking revenge
MATPATT? QUITTING DIET COKE?              i m p o s s i b l e
Me sipping on a ginger ale: interesting
All y'all "Diet Coke is healthier" people need to get out. It HAS BEEN PROVEN that it is NOT any healthier than normal coke, in fact its WORSE for you. I like normal coke, thank you.
B
It’s called fizzy drink here in Australia
The selective debtor ipsilaterally guess because joke conversely preach by a grubby gruesome cent. aromatic, whispering snowman
I still dont have ANY of those stores near me
What's the point of giving up diet coke when you're just going to drink other cola
15:28 Personally, I’ve always called it soda.
I am a D: Other, my entire country (Australia) calls all soda "Soft Drinks" I'll let you guys guess what a "Hard Drink" is.
I have always been a Diet Pepsi man myself.   Diet Coke always tasted a touch too sweet for my pallet.  That said, can't say I agree with the pregame ritual here.  For scientific purposes, as you showed in the pregame fountain, bottle and can do have different flavors (I despise canned soda myself) but if the majority of your sodas you are testing are bottled, the Diet Coke should have been bottled too.
They look similar
She looks annoyed.
Dood I’m vegan and I’ve drank zevia and it’s sooooo baddddd
Mexican soda. Yes.
As a loyal Harris Teeter customer, I am pleased.
I never thought this dark day would come ...........
15:29 its caled kofola here
Clar Cico
The flavors inside the machine taste different like I can get Sprite at McDonald’s and it taste good and  I get Sprite at rallies it’s OK
Me after seeing the titel: Something is not right I can feel it.
Diet sodas are worse than they’re original counterparts
he quit what???????????????
Diet soda can cause type 2 diabetes. Congrats with making 1 year
Here in California we call it soda. My boss is from Michigan and they also called it all coke
grow up people. this is not entertainment
I have just gotten on a food theory Bing and I'm just watched every episode
C Coke (also from NC) 😆
Tbh i have proved my whole life that storebrands (at least here in spain) beat the official products but tbh Mercadona's sodas and Aldi's cola are 10/10
WHAT !!!!!!
is anyone else gonna mention the fact they drank from the same straw not covid safe
As someone who drinks Kroger’s Big K diet cola since I was young, I can tell you it tastes how you describe Harris Teeter diet cola. It’s my go to soda.
Wait....YOU LIVE, IN NORTH CAROLINA??!!! Bruh I could literally drive there (like, southern North Carolina) in 7 hours. I want to visit, but I know that won't ever happen lol
Food theory on Stevia when, I feel it's not talked about much.
Ngl, the food theory intro slaps pretty hard
i love that she didn't count us in Florida as the south west of the U.S. lol
Make a theory on the unsafe petroleum food colors, and unsafe additives and ingredients. Just wanna know if I’m really gonna develop any lasting deformities from eating red 40 or blue 1 in my fruity pebbles
I don't understand why he doesn't have Cockta (actual drink for central Europe)
NANI!!!!!
No lie I drink a lot of Diet Coke too I usually drink 1 2L bottle  every 1-2 days. I’m definitely addicted my I Prefer Safeway’s soda brand
Wow I just moved to the south and it's great to know i have so many diet cola options!😂
while i was watching this is was drinking orange coke no kidding actualy
Before this video starts, let me just say hello to all my fellow gays!
Me: reads title  Also me: clears eye to make sure I’m reading it right
TIL that Harris Teeter is based here in NC  Edit: Wait, Food Lion is NC based as well??? My life is a lie
I pray whoever reads this will be rich and successfull oneday, trust the process and believe in yourself 🙏.
From NC, can confirm.
YOUR IN NC?!?! IM IN NC! I NEVER KNEW MY FAVORITE CHANNEL WAS BASED IN NC!!! 😱😱😱
As a Brit, everyone here calls it “fizzy juice” over here   *(or carbonated beverage if you’re feeling pretentious)*
Lol Pepsi is also from North Carolina, so it was really an instate rivalry
we have food lions in virginia and my fiance LOVES their diet sodas
A
Oregon resident, and I use soda
normal coke
Can yall do an episode of sugar sweeteners march madness style? I recently started using monk fruit sweetener and i swear it tastes like sugar. We use it in baking now.
Of all of us who create memes you are the king of memes because you created the Ness is sans meme
Darn
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
I call it soda. I grew up in the South but my parents are from out West.
Cream soda is really frickin good
I am big sad that they couldn't get RC Cola
Me watching the video drinking Diet Coke is really ironic.
I'm a pop and soda guy
Did matpat chose something over diet-coke
you should try aquairius
I saw the thumbnail.   Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Am I the only one who likes Zevia? Especially Cream Soda flavor!!
Citric acid... Secret Ingredient... Perhaps part of the Krabby Patty secret formula?
Smart thing to do cause diet coke is pure $hit
lol oh no not calories!
Haven't watched anything by this man for YEARS. This video made me click. I had to. This is concerning
MAT I FOUND A COCA-COLA ZERO LEMON THAT FITS YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST COKE
Soda, hands down
I have never been disappointed with a Kroger store brand product.  My daily drink of choice is Kroger Seltzer water, which is not only super cheap, under $3 a 12 pack, but doesn't complicate things with a bunch of off-the-wall flavors.  Their lemon-lime seltzer tastes exactly like they just took their store brand "sprite" and just didn't put any sweeteners in it at all. I highly recommend. They even have a cola seltzer, which would be this same generic diet coke with NO sweeteners.
There’s only one answer. Pop shall always reign supreme
Wow. This guy seems so pretentious. How annoying
I feel ashamed because I’m drinking normal Coca Cola whilst watching this 🤦
Straws ready: doin' Coke on the glass table.
HArris Teeter sales amp up 50%  Mat Pat: Did I have something to do with this...
Well! You can drink regular cola and get diabetes and healthy kids, Or you can drink diet cola and be healthy, and get "glow in the dark" children 🤣
is mat Pat losing it? he might be. if he is, I'm losing it too because I'm trying to get  a jungle fish for that bratty angler so I can get the final piece for the fish finder and it just refuses to reveal itself
I will go drink some water
Matt and his wife look too much like each other
We'd be screwed if we came to visit y'all, then. My wife and I can't have diet soda, and the only sugar-free stuff she can have is stevia, not sucralose. And, for some reason, we thought y'all lived in California. OH well.
Fountain soda will always have an unfair advantage. Be way more interesting to see how bottled or can tastes.  PEPSI MAX FOREVER
its coke in the uk or at least in north yorkshire
Mat: I'm giving up Diet Coke   Everyone: Impossible
Pff soda, everyone knows it's pop🤷🏻‍♂️🇨🇦
We're Midwest, so pop here as well. Coke Zero is our go-to
I say "soda pop"! 😎
I can literally go through 2-3 cans of Pepsi Max in a day ->- (Pepsi Max is a Sugar Free/Diet Pepsi. It’s mainly in Australia and Britain.)
I  still believe he gave up diet coke all of last year
Next can you talk about donuts
D: läsk or soda in Swedish
We here in South Africa call it by its name, Pepsi is Pepsi, Coke is Coke, Fanta is Fanta.
Mountain Dew It’s always Mountain Dew
Water
Hu...its cool whenever i see YouTubers from NC. For some reason its always a surprise to see a cool youtuber either from NC or currently living hear.
Me reading the title: Oh my god he finally snapped back to reality because no offense diet sodas are terrible they taste awful eh I guess kinda sweetish like seriously just diet sodas just taste bad if I want to drink a soda I'll just drink a Coke but I don't drink soda I drink unsweetened tea This was made by tea gang
Every time I don't drink diet Coke for a while it tastes awful but then I try another sip and it tastes good It seems addictive
My mom is soda, my dad is pop, and i am juice (i dont like soda lol). But if I have to pick saying one, you can probably tell which one i say :)
what if you added citric acid ti diet coke, or other items, to see if it makes it taste better? 0-0
Australia- Soft Drink
"die coke"
The real twist for me was finding out that  Harris teeter, Food Lion, and Publix were all southeastern regional brands because I live in NC so I just assumed they were everywhere 🤯
I am a b [soda]
Diet Coke is horrible for you
U used to look like coutinho
MattPatt, the only reason to quit Diet Coke is because of the aspartame!  And it seems you only prefer that aspartame taste.  So, you might as well drink Diet Coke, my dude.
"The southern local grocery stores" *When you live in Texas, which is dominated with H-E-B* 👁👄👁
You should go to the coke factory
I say coke when talking about coke-a-cola but when talking about anything thing else I say soda
Coke zero
How does this guy still have ideas for this channel O_o
Pop
Why diet coke thou??. Its so disgusting and unhealthy.  I had a teacher who used to drink a diet coke daily and died in the middle of the school year.
Steph's face @ 3:45 be like "why do we even need to do this?"
b soda
oh look a fnaf reference within the first minute of the video 😴
Title: MAT QUITS DIET COKE Me: you did WHAT?
I'm a pop guy.
We don’t do the Coke thing in the south to represent everything! When we ask for a Coke, we want whatever cola-flavored soda is available. Dr. Pepper is different entirely. Why does the country think we do this?!  I am willing to die on this hill
Here in Belarus we have no soda/coke/pop we have ГАЗИРОВКА (gazirovka)
Coca cola is evil, they use phosphorus acid, which supports violations of human rights in the phosphorus mines in Africa
Raised a Pop(Ohio/Iowa), married a Soda(Florida), and my Mother in Law(Alabama) says Coke.
FOUR HEAPING POUNDS OF FRESHLY GROUND CITRIC ACID
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
Why is fountain Diet Coke allowed in a store brand competition?
Try goya malta
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Pepsi max is a lot better in my personal opinion it could be just my taste
Soft drinks!
Knowing how Kroger stores are, now that I have worked there for almost 4 years, they probably wouldn’t sponsor something like this.   However, I do get discounted products from their brand if you need anything else to test, I can help you.
I was drinking about 12 cans of diet coke a day until I quit cold turkey 7 years ago. it was a painful cut, but now I'm mostly water now, with some tea.
is it just me or did the sun shine a little brither when diet teeter was declared the winner👀👀
If you buy a good coke syrup, it's amazing with soda stream and can save you money. (not good for mixing with other drinks though since it loses carbonation fast somehow?)
I honestly just call the Soda/pop/coke whatever drink it actually is like sprite or somthing
Is am the only one who drink strawberry milk?
Also diet soda dose have some calories zero isn't actually accurate . Most labels are off by 20% AND THEY ROUND DOWN!
I prefer Coca-Cola
Good 4 u mat diet coke is terrible for your health
Matpat is quitting diet Coke! This is blasphemy
drink the zero brands they all taste way better then the normal diet soda.
Some people: Soda. Other people: Pop. Even other people: Coke. Me: *I prefer the term "sarsaparilla" myself.*
Boylans makes a fantastic cream soda if you like cream soda. 😂
Good MaThical Morning!
See I live in VA and most people here say soda
Soda or pop bending on what part of new England you and what part of the state your in of new England an I dont even know you anymore 😪😅
oh i see, its for the product placement, now you can get sponsored by herris teeser
Hey Mat! I recommend that you account for bud fatigue in future experiments. It doesn't look like it really made a huge impact here, but it can compromise your judgement between 2 different foods. Consider having a palate cleanser for a clean competition in the future~ <3 love your videos!
me and my sisters have an unhealthy addiction to coke, and can easily tell which ones are better of the off brand types but coke is always expensive so we get off brand and it’s the best one. it’s from ✨lidl ✨
wait! you are in North Carolina? WHERE!!!????  lol
D soft drink
False I drin things like sprise Shasta lime ginger ale and body armor.  The coke for my step
14:50 there is more science in this video than any of your fnaf abd minecraft videos combined
Steph thank you for hating stevia as much as I do. I'm tired of people saying it tastes just like all the rest. No it really doesn't
I only drink Mountain Dew and sprite lime soda. But like once a week I drink soda.
i just assumed shasta was my local grocery store brand
This isn't enough of a blind taste test for me
I've had this in the UK too, Aldi's own cola for me just tastes so much better, and is roughly 1/3 of the price of branded coke
if you wanted sweat you drink pepsie, the big stick for coak is the strong carbination too sweet ratio
Fresca matpat
That ain't a theory
2:15 wtf doesnt know what march madness is?
D, other: In Québec (the french part of canada) we call it ''liqueur'' wich woul'd translate to liquor.
abandoning diet coke? who are you and what have you done to matt pat
3:45 turn on English subtitles
Harris teeter cola sales after this video: 📈📈📈📈
Wait... if diet coke has zero calories, then wtf is coke zero 😂😂
Am i the only one who didn't know about "Coca-Cola Life" until he mentioned it until this video?  (Also if anyone has tried Coca-Cola Life can you tell me what its supposed to taste like?)
Just drink vodka
The Dean with hair
here in germany we call it cola. if i need to chose one of you 4 options it would be coke which is fairly often used here too
I’m pop
it imposible he liked something over diet coke
That look on Steph's face at the end: "Who are you and what have you done with my husband?"
water
Softie , from Australia
i am cola
I was honestly surprised and delighted to see you guys mention Publix on here, and even my home state for some reason!  😄  And yeah, sometimes store brand is really good! Sure, the Publix store brand soda didn't make it past the first round, but I like Publix brand beef jerky and barbecue chips, as I think those are pretty good. I don't have much of an opinion on all their brands, but I like those two. Not a fan of their plain potato chips though.
I wasn't pop soda or coke I grew up saying soft drink
Drink water instead.
We pronounce it as Cola, well at least I do 🤣
Actually Coca Cola from different countries have almost completely different tastes due to different regulations or just different taste markets. Wanna test them out?
Have you ever seen philosopher Zizek's take on Coke? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuFo2NUC7rQ From Pervert's Guide to Ideology. It's great.
At least try regular coke,it's good
Favorite soda
Coke
You know it's bad news when Mat quits on diet coke
I am a Coke Zero/no sugar girl myself, I love the flavour and the lack of sweetness 🥰  We also call it soft drink here in Australia but I grew up on a lot of uk and American tv so I personally call it soda or fizzy drink 😅😅
Soda
My favorite part of the video was when they drank the sodas
LOL Coke Bump!
Sprite, best soda
15:30 We call it Cola Zero here.
So when is the theory on how healthy Diet Coke is compared to regular Coke?
We also have food lion in virginia
Wheres Pepsi
Aspertame is Ecoli poop. Silly sheeples.
I personally love the “Zero” sodas (Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, etc) much more than the diet ones. The flavor is very different to me, I don’t know why.
Who wants them to play Draganronpa?
I don't get what people like about dr.pepper, it literally tastes like carbonated cough syrup. Cough syrup tastes good, but not fkin carbonated
in britan we call them by their name or fizzy drinks
In Ireland it's called a soft drink
Soda?  The only soda I need is 100 plus
Actually the most intriguing is 22:22
i grew up near london so we call it all "fizzy"
D: Other  I call them fizzy drinks
what  i say is "cold drink" or "fizzy drink"
Where I live, we call them “sodavand” – literally sodawater. No we don’t shorten it. Mostly people refer to the types of soda, like cola, Pepsi, Mirinda, Fanta, faxe kondi, and so on.
I'm cold drink👌🏾
Boycott Coke
The finalists kind of reminds me of the final race in the first cars movie. The rookie, the veteran and runner up.
Stable video 👍
food lion is Delhaize in Europe
nugget just drinks water 95 percent of the time
I think it should've come down to which one has more aspartame in it. Love that sweet sweet dementia.
I need a episode of this with video of all of this, so like a long episode. Please i need this
On england all fizzy drinks are called soft drinks
I always get the Kroger brand pop. Now I know not only that it is cheaper but also presumably the best tasting pop in the store. What an interesting discovery and a great value. Thanks Food Theory for justifying my shopping habits. =)
i say coke not the one ur thinking of
You can’t have a fountain version of your diet Coke stored at home anyway.
Ciet doke
15:32 D: in Australia, we call it softdrink.
Imagine that the citric acid in the Harris teeter was due to an accident in the production line and matpat, never tasting it again, relapses into diet coke
Soda pop
But Fry's went out of business:'(
I don't know if it's because I grew up on it or not but diet sams cola is ok by itself, but with snack is the best. Somehow the best with rizt crackers, there's just something there that pulls me in every time I walk by it.
Lilt...or lilt zero
A lot of diet coke was consumed that day.
That game of rock paper scissors made me jealous. You found the one man... 😂😭
Diet cola   It’s not Diet Coke a cola
D Here in Scotland it's "Juice" or "Fizzy Juice" (regardless of fruit content...) Or it's "Ginger" (For non-Scots, Google "Irn-Bru" and you'll understand)
Why does Matt have an undercut in the thumbnail and doent anywhere in the video!!!!!🤣😡🤣😡
15:30 here in Florence we actually call soda: "Hoha Hola Hon la hannuccia horta horta"  Wich is just a way with a strong accent to say "coke with a short short straw"
Have I really spent 25 minutes of my life watching a tournament competition between diet colas?!
if he ditches diet coke their stock will drop by like 37%
i prefer the soda stream drinks since its easy and extremly cheap to buy and use ( cheap L price )
What is the name of music in the final round?
17:35  MatPat:  "... this could take it. (V.O.) "And with that-"   **Ad** "A new internet day is dawning..."
Quit YouTube Do us a favor Finally Please
My gptp diet cola is Diet Rite.
in Ireland we call soda fizzy drinks or soft drinks, but usually we just call them their name, we don't rly need a bracket term for them, they usually are just labeled as drinks or beverages
Plot twist :Mat Pat actually made Food Theory just so he can drink every diet soda
I love Diet Cola and I find alot of supermarket cola tastes pretty good. My favourite is diet coke from Lidl of Aldi supermark in the UK, Tesco cola is also pretty good. 😃
Fanta??????????????
Regular is better.
Just ditch the diet, your taste buds will thank you. Also ditch cola because that stuff is nasty🤮.
I love that matpat glossed over the fact that he gave the pope a steam key for undertale. I love so much that he did this unironically, he just wanted the pope to play undertale because it's a special game for matpat and he thought the pope would love it too.  Wich in my opinion is a lot better than giving him a random surf board
The Nectar of the gods has fallen. The elder god has awaken
Looks like Krogers Big K brand has the same ingredients in the same order as Harris Teeter, I'll have to try some tomorrow! (Though my favorite is Diet A&W)
Kroger gang
Here in spain we call them "refresco con gas o sin gas" / with gas or without gas. Thats all we use to diferenciate sodas.
Honestly I'm more intrigued by Matpat with a fade
The Harris Teeter is pretty much an anime protagonist right here. It won although no one took it seriously in the beginning
diet soda bad, normal for the win.
I don't  even drink soda, why am I here?
Harris Teeter: *Is the best diet cola* Me who lives in Pakistan: ;-;
Odd hearing them we call of softdrinks here.
Married Couple Goals: Can't win in Rock Paper Scissors, because you always play the same thing.
wait... foods have OEMs!?
Bro I can tell your wife only puts up with you because you're Rich. The faces she makes says it all
Um in Australia so soft drink
I hate to get controversial on this channel, but Coca Cola has made some racist remarks lately. I recommend not buying from them anymore.
Folks, this is what we call character growth!!!! Also NC REPRESENT!
In Australia, we call it Soft Drink
I don't know about diet soda but Kroger store brands are incredibly consistent throughout the sub brands. Food 4 less sells directly kroger brand in Illinois without their own sub brand, Fry's in Arizona has what tastes the same as Kroger items I know well. To me it is the best "Private Label" for 90% of their products. Great episode, even though I hate diet POP 😁
Do root beers now! Great value root beer from Walmart is def my fav
I can't even fathom how someone can say diet colas taste good. All diet colas taste horrible.
I never liked diet
I'm more of a diet pepsi guy, but this was interesting
Try soda water, all kinds of flavors.
Have you ever had Moxie soda? That soda is something interesting about it. Only so many people like it or not. It’s very distinct
I’ve been raised in southern Louisiana, right above the lake, my whole life and have lived here my whole life except one or two in Missouri, but all my family has called it soda or a soft drink, and my uncle from Wisconsin would call it pop sometimes.
In Ireland we call them fizzy drinks. Or was that just my family.
we call them soft drinks/specific names in the uk, so if you go to a pub and ask for coke and they serve pepsi they'll ask if pepsi is ok
B soda although in Danish it is "sodavand" with direct Translate to "soda water"
in europe we have a lot of food lion
I haven't had diet soda in a long time not since my mother died and took that Abomination Diet Coke with her
Coke zero is my favorite soda next to sparkling seltzers like bubbly and la croie
It’s illegal that Coca-Cola is not sponsoring this video.
D)other: refresco/chesco
D. Ginger
Hi
We call em cold drinks and coke in New Orleans
Harris Teeter represent!
Y'know, there's people who say "soda pop" too LOL I used to say pop all the time... but recently I've switched to soda sometimes. So like. I switch back and forth between pop and soda, and the occasional soda pop. I never use Coke to refer to all types of soda, though. My sister's children call it "bubbles"
Are you okay
im a fizzy drink kinda guy
I ues soda
Pepsi max with 🥭
I've noticed that Zevia tends to work better with things like the orange, grape, and cream sodas rather than the root beer, ginger ale, and lemon-lime sodas. So a lot of it depends on which soda you get. Fruit-based Zevia sodas tend to be more reliably good than the colas and whatnot.
Juice or if you want Scottish slang Jeg XD
If I'm going to drink a cola I prefer wild cherry Pepsi
I cant drink any kind of cola anymore. I drank a can of pepsi as a kid after getting over a flue and spending a hot day outside at school getting super dehydrated. Getting back to the school we were given sodas and i chugged my can. The acid and sugar in my small dehydrated body made me VIOLENTLY sick all over the floor  and ever since the taste of coke or pepsi makes my stomach turn.
Softdrink here in australia
WOO NORTH CAROLINA
Matt: you've probably never heard of food lion   Me who lives in nc and shops there a lot: mmmm I don't think so
Let me just say how Steph has her jaw DROPPED at MatPat's decision See 20:38 onwards dat zoom at 20:54
Stevia is bad for you 😤 DONT DRINK IT!
Coke all day. Raised in Tennessee have moved all around the country and haven't broken that habit. Although occasionally i have asked for an ice cold sodie pop
Here in Australia it’s fizzy drink
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Matpat: [picks the soda that's not diet coke as his favorite] Everyone: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MAT?!
Shasta is a drink I had as a kid because it's caffeine free and caffeine would give me headaches. The local religion also forbid caffeine on religious days so I always had Shasta as a kid because of its availability.
sweet tea
First off, Diet Coke tastes like Diet, not Coke
Does mat hare normal coke lmao?
Why do people say 21st century? This is an honest question I’ve had, the 21st century would mean 2100 which is a full 100 years away. Why do people say “21st century”?
I’m soda personally I’m legitimately in between The West south North and east Because I am in Colorado in some different places there like what type of Coke do you want sometimes they’re like what type of pop do you want some of them are even what type of soda pop do you want   Every time they say soda pop I freak out because I can’t tell where they’re from  it kills my brain
You can tell he getting crazy when he tries to replace diet coke
The sore pruner microregionally wonder because mallet dfly detect unto a broken division. unbecoming, shy turtle
The look on Stephs face is the look someone gives when she thinks her husband is a SKRULL! Lol
Mat betrayed us
call me weird but i just call them carbonated drinks or by name ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I object, Florida isn’t part of the south  East United States, it’s its own entity
My family calls it sweet oil
C. Coke.
D: fizzy drink.
Off-brand products can often be inconsistent, as they are more or less scraps of the real brands. So one day you buy it it's literally the same as the branded option, the other day it's like the worst thing possible
Coke Zero > Diet Coke
Please no with the aspartame pseudoscience sourced from Wikipedia, MatPat. The bans on it are ridiculous. It's a dipeptide of aspartic acid and phenylalanine that dissociates into those constituent amino acids in your stomach. Unless you have phenylketonuria, it is not a concern.   Support science, not fearmongering.
me: *sees the title of this video* also me: *impossible*
He wanted the truth, but he also just found a deeper plot hole in the soda hole.
March Madness on Food Theory?! SO DOPE!!!!!
C
B and C. I grew up in an area that called it soda, but my classmates and I, in fifth grade I believe, held a vote to see if Coke or Pepsi was better. Coke won, and we started calling all soda coke as a show of victory. Thus, I now refer to most sodas as coke.
Here in South Africa we also call everything coke :D
Lol when I read the title of the video I thought he quit YouTube 😂😂😅😅😅😅
Mat: “Are you Pop, Soda, Coke or other” Me: “I’m a attack helicopter” brrrrr
Weird thought, but also try any flavored waters. they end up being super-low calorie drinks with no sugar.
Harris boutta suddenly get framed/disappear I’m tellin ya
Was I the only "Soda pop" kid?
Im a soda guy
dont forget that aldi and lidl buys from big companies but they buy the grade b product, that the big brands dont use because theyre under their quality limit
Go with RC Cola. They don’t get political.
What about the hot wings episode in 2020 were he drunk Diet Coke to see if it made the sauce lets hot?
B for sure
I live in a stereotypical small town in Arkansas. I have lived in the South my whole life and have been to many states in said region. That being said, I have never ever heard the word “Coke” used to refer to all sodas. Period. I don’t know who or what started this but it is a straight-up lie 😂😂
Your wife is great she said wow
never seen an episode of this. love the good eats intro. thanks matpat
What is he theorising in this?
I made the same whoopsie. Decided not to eat any candy for the year on january 1st 2020. Soon realized what a mistake that was but still went through with it
this madlad he quit diet coke
Not sientificly possible
Soda
Mythical Beasts already know the power of the Kroger brand, it always wins in the name brand vs. store brand game
if you like fruity flavors wait till you drop diet all together, it will blow your mind to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Oh, I recall Food Lion. Not for good reasons either.
Didn’t include RC Cola?  They’re available everywhere, no?    We only drink cola with real sugar. Can’t stand corn syrup.  Really can’t stand ANY diet soda, or any artificial sweetener.  Ruins lots of foods too. Stevia is one of the worst, right behind aspartame (both give me headaches).
WTF YOU QUIT DIET COKE WHO ARE YOU
Straight up in my house we prefer Diet Big K over Diet Coke too! This was actually super cool to find out why, thats crazy!!
In Europe we got a chain called Auchan. Straight up their store brand is better than any coke or pepsi
Coke.
lol if you could somehow get a hold of the coca leaf or coca tea, mixed with cacao powder and honey. then carbonate you would actually have a very healthy tasty drink.  but the coca leaf is illegal because of its refined form.
There's at least one Food Lion in Fresno if i remember correctly...
Stay off all soda while your kidneys are still working.  Once they stop working it dialysis or transplant!
As far as I know, most Texans say soda
Diet Coke is best
Where I am from we call it "Softdrink" I guess it's in contrast to "hard drinks" like Alcohol... we drink a lot where I am from.
What I learned from this episode is : People don't know the difference between Draft, Bottle, and Can. Best example I can give is : Guinness. Draft is the best, followed by bottle, than can. If I'm cooking a corned beef loaf, you better believe I'm putting bottled Guinness over canned Guinness in my crock pot.
Ive been drinking 4-6 Green Monster Energys every day for 15 years and i haven't even reached diabetes yet. But yeah im working on quitting now. If i dont drink at least one i get insane migraines atm.
About 7 min in you said something that made me go 😳 "soda specialty shops"                                               🙄🤯 can anyone clarify that these things exist???
it smells/tastes like cough syrup because its DIET 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
:/
I've heard more people talk about the "in the south it's all coke" than I've actually heard it in practice.
I call it soft drink or soda.
Ahhh, I wish I could stop consuming aspartam, but there aren't any zero sugar colas without it in my area :c
Why you gave up?
in australia we just call it by its name eg coke is coke coke zero is coke zero fanta is fanta pepsi is pepsi etc
diet pepsi matpat
Soft drink
It's made with man-made artificial sweeteners that can lead to diabetes, tooth decay and bad breath. DUH
Soda homie
I used to have a 2 liter of dr pepper or cherry pepsi with lunch and dinner... It was so bad and I felt terrible so often that i decided to just give up soda cold turkey. I relapse every now and again but for the most part, I'd say i drink less than 1% of what I used to 3 years ago
good. regular coke is soo much better than diet.
Boylan is just insanely good, no matter the flavor they're bottling. Here in sweden we even have a website cataloging and rating ever single available cola and Boylan came out on top, it's absolutely remarkable. Only problem is it costs a lot because it doesn't have that big-cola import-power
diet coke is just watery cokecola
Here in Australia we call it soft drink lmao
"I quit diet coke" Not Scientifically possible
Team soda
He needs therapy
In the UK, we don’t really have one name for it all, but we mainly just say the name of the drink, of just say soft drink.
Please don't say God's name in vain
I peaced out when he said he preferred fountain over plastic and can.  It's literally the least of the two because the fountain soda is flatter, sweeter and often times the syrup is days old so it tastes janky
There are probably over 100 different tea products and east asia
I didn't believe it until afterwards, the idea that you would ever give up Diet Coke is absolutely absurd!
I live in Asia so sweet tea products are more common
Coke Zero is better, it has a whole nascar race named after it, no other Soda has that right now, sure it used to be the Pepsi 400 but nowadays it is Coke Zero 400
You should just drink diet mountain dew
We call it sot drink, hmm
I am so proud of you Matt.
Me watching this the next day drinking coffe
soft drink is the correct name for those drinks
Dude, how would we know if its the same flavor?  We didn't get the Harris Teeter tasting...
Well, your fist problem is drinking diet soda. It’s always gonna be the nastier flavored one no matter the brand. Second... why not... just not drink pop?
I'mma "soda" guy.
I'm from the south but I call it "soda" and it drives me crazy when I hear people use coke as a general term. I also couldn't help but notice you and Steph pronounce "both" as "bolth" which is interesting because my roommates also say bolth. They probably picked that up from their parents who were from California
Born 'n raised in California soda is what i grew up calling it
In nz it’s fizzy or fizz
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Soda
Everyone who doesn’t call soda soda is wrong
Its D Here in the Philippines we call it “softdrinks” not “soda” 😂
Oh my GOD you do NOT need to smack your lips THAT many times after every SIP!!!! 😂😂😂😡😡😡
Fountain any type of soda is the best. It’s sweeter, (I feel like) it is more carbonated, and it just tastes better.
Watch the stocks!
Use Coke Zero Or Normal Coke. Because Coke Light Tricks Your Body Into Thinking that it is a better Version of Coca-Cola. And Diet Coke Gives Your Liver *Fake* Sugar.
Mathew, why do you always have your sister in your videos?
Born and raised in the Northeast of the U.S. it's always been soda for me.  Orange cream is my go to soda.
Milk
Matt, we have a brand of Diet Soda that comes from Detriot Michigan that's sold for $1 for a 2.5 liter size through Dollar Tree stores that actually is a national brand. You might want to try Faygo or diet Faygo & see how it compares. I fell in love with this soda & made me stop buying Pepsi Zero. (formerly Pepsi Max) You might want to give Diet Faygo a try?
D: Soft Drink (Australia)
I got a king soopers brand grape and red cream soda that made me sick... No thanks dawg
Here in Australia we call our carbonated drinks soft drinks... don't know if other places call them that.
Harris Teeter Zero Calorie Cola sales are going to SKYROCKET after this video. I'm convinced
lemon gang
Harris Teeter is basically Little Mac Diet Coke was Mike Tyson.
Can't believe both Steph and Mat chose something other than diet coke!
I’m gonna grab Ralphs brand diet soda and see if it has the taste you described haha. I’ll update this tomorrow once I can nab it!
Am I dumb— I just realized you’re the same guy as game theorist.. I thought y’all sounded similar:l
Maybe Harris Teeter Cola will sponser you!
Pop in Michigan I thought we were the only ones
My comment is going to be lost, but try Fizz and Co "seltzer water with cola flavor." It's unsweetened but very good. It's also in the Kroger family. I can't even drink naturally or artificially sweetened pop anymore, the unsweetened is just too good.
15:30 I call them fizzes
TLC : My strange addiction ??
This can't be true... The Cola must be a paid actor.
I never thought I’d live to see the day...
Matt: The south-east of the US. Steph: And Florida. Matt: Florida... is in the south-east of the US. Steph (thinks): Yeah, but it wouldn't otherwise count, because... Florida.
Do MSG actually bad or it because racism
I want MSG theory
FYI Boylan’s Root Beer is soooooo much better than their cola

B
I'm from Louisiana and I call them soft drinks lol
Coke bruh I hated going to a restaurant and saying coke and them not asking what kind it took me a year to get used to it after moving to Oregon
I might regret this suggestion depending on how it turns out, but maybe a good Food Theory episode could be one for powder drink mixes meant to add flavor and vitamins to bottles/pitchers of water? To curb the "need" to get a flavorful, but sugar-loaded soda whenever went out to eat rather than settling for water when was younger, had tried opting for a cheaper substitution of one of these local grocery store colas.   However, while it solved the cost issue of getting that soda fix, it didn't solve the sugar content issue. So to solve THAT, after seeing it in an isle I'd decided to try out these artificially flavored, 0-sugar drink mixes. I cared more about the drink being flavorful, than it needing to particularly be the flavor of soda. But was it really the healthier option, given the highly artificial nature of it? Or is the health benefit of these mixes not nearly as effective as expected?
Coke and soda
I can relate MatPat, I drink a ton of Diet Pepsi and I drink it daily
The Original Boylan Cola is great. It has more of an "adult" cola flavor. Less sweet and more tasteful.
I'm in the south but I call it soda
Soda
I thought you live in California, MatPat.
Aw I’m sad about boylan because they truly do create good sodas! I love their cream soda. But yes the flavors can be very unique!!
I can never understand how anyone drinks any type of diet soda, I guess it must be an acquired taste. Everytime I've tried to drink diet soda I end up spitting it out, I can't even swallow it.
Somebody tell plankton citric acid is the secret formula
Ah but I'm much more of a Sprite/Fanta person if I have to go for soda, lemonade if it's juice. For as much as it would be neat to check out diet Cokes in my area I can't find myself enjoying doing so
A: Pop
See's Title Me: Impossible Perhaps The Cola Is Incomplete
mat pat has a stroke challenge
D: cocaine
Just drink water it takes like nothing
Am i the only person who thought he lived in California and not North Carolina?/?????
Coke
bro its coke
Should of made the video title i quit coke so everone would think your a drug addict
Obviously since they're in NC now, MatPat has to ditch the plain colas and go for Cheerwine. I still have a buddy from HS send me Cheerwine occasionally, and I don't even drink much soda at all
I remember going to Food Lion when I lived in Virginia
So diet cola from Kroger-owned stores are the best huh? I’ll keep an eye out the next time I stop by Payless.
subscribe or matpats kidneys will fail
I don’t see how anyone can drink Diet Coke, it’s horrible and too bitter
How could you possibly have expected the “original recipe” for Boylan to be 0 calorie Diet Coke?
You guys see the nervousness in Mat as he began to suspect he might like another drink than his usual love? You guys see how SCARED he got?? Like he was breaking down to cheat and he KNEW it
I think it's true. I think kroger might have the best soda.
NO RC COLA?! CRIMINAL.
I think we call it soda, but it really depends the person. I think I've heard 'soda pop' as well.
I'd love to see a video on private label products
I'm a Pop Person myself
Soda all the way. I know people who say Coke in reference to all sugary drinks, but they're few in numbers down here in Texas, at least in DFW.
Why are the MAs and WA highlighted?
We call it pop in MT.
Wait is there no Publix in the western part of the US?????????
Pop
A 16 team bracket works like this 1 vs 16, 2 vs 15, 3 v 14, 4 v 13, 5 v 12, 6 v 11 7 v 10, 8 v 9
I've never understood diet sodas as a concept.  They all taste awful compared to their regular counterparts while not actually being any healthier.
Steph is definitely right, coke zero is my soda of choice.
This just changes everything I know about the Theorist channels, I been watching them since 2013 so this just blew my mind.
soda
>invent cola as a cough syrup >don't change the recipe in 100 years >still tastes like cough syrup makes sense to me
I’m a soda pop man my self
You really shouldn't drink diet soda anyway due to the aspartame...it's worse for than regular soda. Zevia is probably the best option.
food theory:*battling for the best soda me:*takes a sip of my fanta grape me: pathetic...
You people eat like flies
MatPat: "PICK A LANE, AND STICK WITH IT!" Also MatPat: switches lanes twice
Oh man, I'm more of a can guy...The fountain is the one that I can't do.
With that RPS play, you two are made for each other.
Diet soda is worse for you than regular. Tastes terrible too.
Should have added citric acid to diet acid.
I say lemonade
im a sodapop man, soda and pop and sodapop are all interchangeable, just how i feel at the time, that being said i live in ohio so pop is more common but i also say the others too
I thought Matt and Steph lived in california, today i learned differently
shout out to King Soopers the #1 socialization location for 7th graders who cant drive
Matt Patt found a new favorite!
im A
The Rock Paper Scissors was amazing honestly my favorite thing with Food Theory videos is almost not the content, it's watching the amazing chemistry between Matt and Stephanie
Wait.. Do you live in Asheville too? If so we should hang out. Would be cool for sure.
I don't know what restaurants Stephanie went to, but as a native North Carolinian, I've only heard soda to refer to fizzy soft drinks in restaurants. However, most of the people I talk to use coke for the term.
Went to my local fry’s, tasted like how mat pat described it, even if i don’t like diet soda still tasted really good!
The medicine flavoring is the best part.
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you ❤️ Never give up on your life! 🙏🏼
Did u quit kuz theirs traces of the same chemical that found n rat poison in diet sodas ? Lol
screw you lions diet cola, Pepsi is the best number1
Pop is the only correct word to use to refer to carbonated beverages. I will not be taking questions at this time.
I love how the underdog wins. I don't know why, I just love it
His wife is trying to look professional and then there’s mat
Boylan birch beer is my personal favourite soda. I can't speak for their diet stuff, but don't let their reaction put you off. Boylan deserves a try at least.
MatPat: No one is ever gonna call it that though. Jacksepticeye: Hold my Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Same Great Coke Taste now with a hint of added Vanilla
im calling it right now, the next thing will be... "the theory theorists" **intro plays**
Why not try Coke zero?
I say soda.
I used to say coke as a catch-all, but that gets confusing really fast, so I say soda... except I moved to Ohio, so I say pop on purpose to be understood better
Fountain coke just build different
Primarily A but I grew up around some B too, due to family. PA is weird like that. (soda & pop)
we have food lion in georgia too lol
Isn’t diet soda like, worse for you than normal soda?
15:26, no they don't, I've been born and raised in North Carolina, and no one that I have met as ever called all soda's Coke.
.... I think you sufferin from withdrawl bro....
Thumb nail : I quit Diet Coke!  Me : no NO NOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOOooOoOoOOoOoOOOooOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOooOoOoooOoOoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coke zero remains my go to and no one can ever change my mind.
Kudos to Kroger always beating the name brands. Gmm anyone?
boylan is the best  i wont take this hate
I’m surprised that we haven’t gotten a krabby patty secret formula episode yet
Rock Paper Scissors between them proved to me they’re the perfect couple
How doe
at 1800 he says 13 seed. instead of ten
I think pretty much all Kroger branded stuff is better than name brand. Their soda is awesome, their many varieties of Mac and cheese dwarf Kraft's offerings, etc. I am in Las Vegas so we have Smith's. Kroger FTW.
Sports Theory??
And here I am shopping at food lion in GA for my coke, which is Mountain Dew.
Diet Dr. Pepper. Try it out. I know it's not cola but it's technically ur best replacement
Steph is right Coke Zero is the correct choice.
Pop
1. Pop is too weird 2. Coke is just annoying because coke is a drink 3. Soda makes the most sense because it doesn’t sound weird and isn’t a single drink
Next theory, is taco bell's cups reused, I got a icey and for some reason, it taste like mountain dew
I'm from Cincinnati and I say soda. Apparently it's a thing brought to the area by people from Pennsylvania. Supposedly.
That rock paper scissors game had me cackling xD
I bet you can replicate the flavour by using diet pepsi and diet dr.pepper mixed together. Something like a ... 1:3 ratio of Dr.Pep to pepsi.
The disillusioned law objectively depend because charles biomechanically treat athwart a quixotic lyric. crazy, whispering wool
i read the title and almost shat myself.
How's this a theory? It's just, "Which diet sode so I like most" That's not a theory
Pick n' save here in Wisconsin that just got bought up by Korger about 3-4 years ago
A, B, and D: I alternate between soda and pop. The region I (and my dad) grew up in is "pop" but the St. Louis region, where my mom grew up, is in a hot spot of "soda". So I easily flip back and forth between the two.
We call it Coke
Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer is the best soda. I won't argue on this one.
I'm a "Soda Pop" guy from Colorado I'll usually say soda pop, but if I'm breaking it down I say Soda. Colorado is very diverse in this as it is with Carmel and Caramel. Colorado is kind of a catch all, we even say both you all and y'all. The thing we agree on is T's we don't say Ts, so when I say mountain; I say Moun'ain or Kitten, I say Khe-ehn. So with Soda Pop we just can't decide what is right, there are no Ts so we just say Soda pop lol
why am i up at 12am
Like this if you’re also a Diet Coke addict
I say soda and I'm from PA.
I call it soft drink...
Over in the down under we call it soft drink which juts means fizzy drink with no alcohol.
Lmfao. When the filler wins
I have to say that I am not super impressed with the methodology this time around.  As Mat mentions the different sources have differing flavor.  If this were a true test then it should have been either the canned or bottled diet Coke vs the others as they were all bottled or canned.  Or those that are available as fountain should have been tested as fountain and not the canned or bottled versions.  I would be curious if this would change the outcome.
Wouldnt the fountain drink and the soda fountain very between runs depending on calibration and such?
une fois, je multiplie tant de nombres que j'ai oublié de compter.  puis je me suis levé et je sais que je devais crier et crier.  neuf fois dix, comptez-les et posez-les, il est temps de vous amuser à nouveau.

idk if u guys got this coke zero lemon thing but thats way better than the normal coke zero.
In New Zealand we call it fizzy
ok so diet soda sucks like completely, just drink water, and tea.
Coca-Cola: demole un patrocinio a este patojo!!  Matpat: que rica la coca del súper
I have never found a generic that can emulate diet mountain dew   Most are more like Sprite or 7up
Where is your Pubsub Mat!? Where is it!? You got a Publix around, but no chicken tender sub?
Pigs must be flying all over the place
I work at Harris Teeter... Ngl the root beer as great too
Matpat reminds me of my grade 8 teacher who drank diet coke like everyday when I saw him at school, like literally had a diet coke on his desk everyday.
Aspartame - sweet rat poison
Diet Coke can increase symptoms of depression.  How do you avoid that?
“POP SODA” HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Me see’s matpats video WHAT no every time I think of diet coke it’s you
In Australia its D: Fizzy drink
I call it………………………………………………… unwobbly pop
One day I’m just going to see matpat at McDonald’s ordering 50 Diet Coke‘s looking like he’s drunk and because he hasn’t had any I can just hear him whispering I need my Diet Coke I need my Diet Coke.
Drink fanta
I’m glad that this arc isn’t canon.
Cran ginger-ale
Just start drinking LaCroix. The drink of ex-addictions!
I too drank a lot of diet cook, but have recently gone cold turkey and truly quit Diet Coke. I’m all about water now
soda
see you see kay
I love Ginger Root or Cream Soda Zevia!! I'm a Pop person, though I say soda too....my teacher is Australian and says 'Soft Drink.'
Is that matt in the thumbnail? And is he getting older??
B, also, where is diet root beer?
Publix soda isn’t carbonated, that’s why coke has more of a acidic taste
Mat- you've probably never heard of Food Lion I don't think I've ever not lived near a Food Lion 😂😂
First Steph leaving GTlive now Matpat quitting Diet Coke? Are we in the wrong timeline
Fountain should not of won due to inconsistency with the syrup amounts whether the bag was just replaced or not
ah food lion.....my local market
I don't drink diet cola but I can say I prefer the Kroger brand cola from Fry's over Coke.
Nah, it’s not soda, pop, or coke... it’s soft drink!
So wait...they moved to NC?
I drink a lot of sprite
I was a lil upset when I didn't see any Kroger brand on this video (since that's the store I grew up going to) but loved to hear that Mat's winning soda was actually manufactured by Kroger, so cool. Kroger brand has the best stuff, they even have dry aged steaks lol.
I grew up saying soderpop cause my parents said soda but where I lived everyone said pop
I grew up calling it soda, but my grandmother called it tonic.
This HAS to be clickbait. It HAS to. Right???      ...right?
Yo, from Wyoming, Midwest, it's soda here.
quit drinking soda. jfc so many people replace water with soda
You should try Virgil’s Zero Sugar Cola.  Qualitatively, if you were to compare zero calorie sweetness for health effects, you would have to eliminate both aspartame and Sucralose from the competition.  That said, fountain drinks always taste better than their bottled/canned brethren.
big f, Dr. pepper is best soda.
I've known people who only get water primarily from diet coke.
As an expert on using the right words at all times, I say pop.
Soda, with the very occasional soda pop, and as a child it was Sody(So-Dee) My grandpa calls it Totypop(tow-tee-pop)
Im other I prefer whiskey specifically Irish whiskey
One of the true tests of a soda, is how it tastes over ice.  Was this experiment done with how temperature effects taste?
Fun fact: the whole Coke vs Pepsi thing started _after_ the same big parent company bought *both* corporations.
I literally can go through 1 liter a day of diet coke. I'm pretty sure I might die.
Pop one hundred percent
soft drink down under.
Growing up in Atlantic Canada both soda and pop mean the same thing and are often used interchangeably.
I feel like you’ve said it before and I even think remember you saying it but I always forget that you live in North Carolina
Rootbeer is the best soda, and it’s diet version isn’t as good, but it’s better than Diet Coke.
It’d be so funny if at the end he said “sponsored by Harris Teeter”
Pop!!!😁
18:31 ummm u sure about that its literaly coke zero
15:29 Calling it coke is dumb and I will never concede to the opposite notion  By the way, I call it soda
C. And D. (juice) for me. (from Bangladesh my area)
In Maryland we have Harris Teeter and Food Lion, too. Soda is the commonly used name. I can’t have soda but i thoroughly loved this video
God bless you all in Jesus’ name!   The LORD is coming soon, and we all must be ready!  Repent of your sins and believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved!
C! I personally like coke zero best!
12:21 'cause it's Whole Foods' Bizzare Adventure
Steph is so 🔥
If you guys are ever up in new hampshire or mass you should try moxie. Both regular and diet are great
Harris Teeter is the Loyola Chicago of soda products, huh
Yup what coke do you want, dr. Pepper
B. Soda
Soda
Zevia is good but the after taste is hard to get behind.
You should take a look at Aldi sometime
Do a fourth channel towards youtube for theories
Hi
I work at a food lion in Virginia and I’m very proud lmao
Fred Meyer in Tacoma!
I recently started buying Virgil's Zero Sugar Cola, among other flavors, and I really like it but I think that stevia is an acquired taste.  Most good tasting stevia drinks also blend in some monk fruit too.
...soda stream... *SODA STREAM!* With a little bit of Mio for flavor. ...no caffeine though.
I live in the Mid west and I say Soda
Oh yeah, MatPat, the “Wario is 10 feet tall” guy!
I like water
Saw the thumb nail and thought: “o great matpat is going to quit Diet Coke”  Reality: “Were looking for a replacement for Diet Coke”.  😔
I just started drinking flavoured carbonated water because I realized that it wasn’t the sweet taste i craved from soda but the carbonation in the drink that i craved so, i now drink more water and also quench my fizzy cravings
I've lived in the south all my life and I've always said and hear soda... I've never heard anyone say coke referring to anything other than coke.
The weird southern think of its all just called coke isn't true lol I lived in the south in several states almost my whole life  and never encountered that once lol I ways always heard soda
I'm very curious to know if you compare the Harris Teeter one to to something like Cherry diet Coke something that has a little bit more fruity flavor if it would have been a more even contender and would have changed your mind
Jones soda!!!
B:soda
me(drinking a beer):"diet soda is so unhealthly"
I always said both pop and soda I was bore up north but grow up in the south
I WILL DRIVE TO RALPHS IN DOWNY CA TO TRY THE DIET COLA!!!!
Run it back turbo
Im from texas and i grew up saying soda, i hear ppl call it coke. On an annual check up my doc said if i drink pop and i was very confused on what pop was.
Woop woop nc ✋
Be pretty cool to try this with other sodas or foods or something. This was surprisingly entertaining to watch
I do not drink diet cola... so no comment on that flavor... but I just recently started drinking Boylan Root Beer & Ginger Ale after finding it in Kroger... They are 2 of my new favorites now.
Food lion is in Belgium as well, it's called Delhaize here. I just looked it up  and it was acctually founded in Belgium in 1867
I hate you guys!
Jack calls the zero sugar by the real FULL name.
I really hope we see you mixed every diet cola together and try it...
In Australia we call it Soft Drink
BRB running to Harris Teeter now. Thank goodness it's 24/7.
i remember a store brand garlic powder. giant container. $5 and tasted better then the name brand small container that cost the same price. they stopped carrying it after that first shipment though. unfortunately
Me having lived in North Carolina all my life: Wait. Harris Teeter/Food Lion aren't everywhere???
honestly cant really support a compant like coke. they are pretty garbage
Smells and tastes like cough syrup because Coca-cola was originally supposed to be cough syrup. Since they didn't change the flavour, and they likely used a similar recipe as the original Coke, it would have that same cough syrup flavour.
Diet Coke id like the worst of the worst as far as taste for diet pop (soda) if you ate going to punish yourself at least drink Diet Dr Peppet.
D: Softdrink
as a true soda aficionado and addict i could never settle to only one soda flavor. some days its pepsi, others its dr pepper, rarely its even cola
I would not do well at this taste test. I'm the person who thinks that pretty much every cola tastes the same. I didn't even know Coca Cola and Doctor Pepper were supposed to have different tastes until this video!
Local brands are often good, but can sometimes go flat faster or lose their taste quickly.  But if you want some, just drink it fast.  Also Boylan's Root Beer is amazing.  I don't know about diet.
In the south, can confirm. Everything is Coke
this made me crave coke
21:53 Steph realizing she doesn't know MatPat anymore lol
The lighting....
I use soda or "soft drink" or just "cola"
Never clicked so fast in my life
There are 2 krogers near me
Now they are going to go buy out the whole pallet
His addiction stopped
Has anyone noticed the blacked out banana in the background
I recommend Shasta cola or Lariat cola if not accessible try RC cola.
Boylans root beer is my go to root beer, also Harris Teeter v. Food lion actually sounds like a college basketball game
Diet soda is worse than real soda
Soda
Immediate reaction to title: "Pfft AS IF!"
Just drink Harris Teeter at home and Diet Coke at restaurants. You can’t get fountain Diet Coke at home nor Harris Teeter at a restaurant
Yup what can I say North Carolina for the win 🏆😏
"yes, that means I've been eating paint chips all day" I never had a doubt in my mind that you eat paint chips, Mat.
Too bad I dont have anyone of those stores that sell that 2nd place cola
Pop
What a twist ending!!!
I call it soda pop😂
I gotta say that if you're enjoying the citric acid, then give coke zero w/ a slice of lemon a try. It's top notch stuff. Lime's good too, but I rarely have as many of those laying around.
oh my god, ive worked at food lion for nearly 3 years and i got so excited when he mentioned it haha
I needed a video so boring it would help me fall asleep. Thanks for the vid
algorithmically the competition they are doing only allows a first place. For a second place they would have to redo the test.
Wow. Nice clickbait. We know you, mat. You will never truly forget diet coke.
Okay, even before finishing the episode, I seen all the local chains creeping up the brackets and thought to myself, "Wow, I'd love to see how Kroger's soda would stack up... All of their store-brand stuff is SO good." - Sure enough, the winner ends up potentially being manufactured by Kroger. lol
*Decides not to include any colas with added fruity flavor* *Tries cola with added citric acid* MatPat: *Mind Blown*
Soda gang
You should try Julmust
Future food theory video idea... Food Theory: What Food Tastes Worse With Citric Acid?
blasphemy!
B: Soda
Diet Cheerwine is the best. But it's not cola flavored. (It's cherry.)
SODA. NOT POP. (And who tf calls it all coke?)
where im from (isreal) we say cola or coca cola
Fake sugars are addictive poison.
Soda
I've never tried their diet options, but I absolutely love Boylan's cane sugar sodas. And I also love Coca Cola Life, middle of the road as it may be. This video was entertaining but did me no good! LOL
You know, with the KFC, AppleJacks, and now the diet cola episode I’m beginning to think MatPat just likes the taste of citrus
Matt revealing his location    Theorists: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TO NORTH CAROLINA WE GOO
Rip Diet Coke sponsor
Where I’m from they call it soft drink
Who else is from North Carolina? W
Me living in New England not having any of the stores that supply the holy fruity coke😔
I have a greatly cut down my soda consumption but if I’m gonna have one you can’t go wrong with Vanilla Coke. If you can ever find it, Big Red is a special treat. Oh how can I forget some of the good Tex-Mex places have Jarritos. That is probably the best soda I’ve ever had the Mandarin is to die for. I realize none of these meet your criteria but MatPat...If I’m going to consume a poison I might as well fully enjoy it.
Flaw in your plan, even if you don't pick diet coke again. You used fountain, but there is no quality control from fountain to fountain. McDonald's Diet Coke will likely be mixed differently from BP diet cola.
YALL CALL PEPSI MAX PEPSI ZERO????
He forgot about the meme  I JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY WIPPED AND NAE NAWD
Thought this would be about coke being racist
Drink water!!!!
The Kroger brand of soda is Big K and I stand by the fact that it’s so much better than Coca-Cola, plus it’s always 99 cents here in Michigan
Coke y’all
Fun fact: the taste of fountain soda is never consistent, as the fountain mixes components from several bottles to make the soda and pour it into your cup. which means sometimes one component will run out and the soda will taste awful, or that each machine mixes the components differently
I've never understood the point of drinking diet sodas. They are FAR more unhealthy for you than a normal soda, and in fact, have actually been linked to more cases of obesity than normal soda, as well as having many artificial sweeteners that have been linked to cancer. Ditch the diet soda, and just find a regular soda that you enjoy. The risks that come with drinking diet sodas far outweigh the calories "saved".
Boylan’s cream soda is the best
Please don’t start selling a Matpat soda
where are the orange crush addict
I can't believe I just watched an episode on a competition for the best diet cola. I hate cola, diet cola even more so. Honestly, I'd probably enjoy consuming that Christmas tree more than I would judging this contest.
Me living in North Carolina and knowing the outcome before the video ends
Idk why but steph u look especially beautiful in this. I can’t stop staring at your face😂😂❤️❤️
12:24 did you just make a jojo reference?

I don't understand the love for any kind of diet soda. It all tastes like death to me. But you do you.
There's two Food Lions in my hometown in Virginia.
We call it fizzy or Fizz over here in New Zealand. Sprite is my jam, and for some reason tastes even better when enjoyed with some KFC.
#26 on Trending!
Good to know that I am not the only one who thinks fountain Diet Coke tastes better
I work at a food manufacturing facility for our local grocery chain in Pittsburgh, PA and we call our private label items “own brands”. Also, we call it “pop” in south western Pennsylvania.
18:20-19:10  This is why you guys are married
Holy cow! I didn't know you you were a fellow North Carolinian!!! BTW Diet Pepsi is my favorite 😏  Btw: It's soda, you tell me to get you a Coke guess what you're getting 😅
Whaattttttt! He actual found something else he likes more than Diet Coke!!!!! 😮
Canadian, so it's pop for me
Mat, I'm from Argentina, you should try Manaos cola.

Okay but the click-bait title
There's ben a glitch in the matrix
Ayo we got Food Lion in South Carolina too excuse me sir.
Faygo for all you Michiganders (& some Ohio peeps). ❤️
When Mat says I've never heard of Food Lion Me: MY JOB IS FOODLION
I grew up calling it Coke.  It's just a Southern thing.  Coca-Cola started in Georgia, spread out, and it's been around for over a century.  In a lot of places in the South, Coke was the ONLY carbonated beverage for a long time.
The strange gemini morphometrically preach because dirt predominantly zoom till a hypnotic pedestrian. squeamish, warlike quince
I use soda in both English and spanish and I come from the midwest
Faygo soda
I was about to be sad that Kroger brand soda was not part of this competition. I love that the secret Kroger product comes in for the win!
15:30 here in Australia, we usually say "oh what soft drink do you want" yeah we say "soft drink"
You Live in N.C. your drink of choice is Cheerwine
Pop #minnesotain
FOOD LION IS AN EASTERN SHORE THING, I THOUGHT EVERYBODY HAD THAT??????
Honestly, the only thing I've found that stevia works with is coffee.  And you gotta make sure to not overdo it.  Like a third or less as much stevia as you would sugar.
As a former Harris Teeter employee: yes, the HT brand items and the Kroger brand items are the same things just with different labels. Sometimes, it's not even labeled differently. The Simple Truth, Simple Truth Organic, Pet Pride, Luvsome, and Private Selection brands are found in both stores. (There might be more, I don't remember all of the HT brands.) When the pandemic hit and we ran out of HT brand rice, we had Kroger rice on our shelves instead. Same thing, different label.
Ohio girl here. We call it pop
A lot of time Soda maybe sometimes Drink few times Coke
We never thought this would happen
Coke Zero is the best!😤
I am not surprised he could taste and point out the difference between fountain, can, and plastic bottle.  Personally, I prefer glass because the flavor is so much cleaner in its flavor.
In Arizona we have A BUNCH of other brands that actually (sometimes) taste really good
Just drink GFUEL!!!!!
The scientific argument respectively offend because lobster coincidently reply out a cynical improvement. abandoned, agreeable cloud
Just curious if you considered soda temperature in your variables. I noticed there's no ice in your sodas. I assumed they are all room temp? Temperature has a significant effect also on taste and refreshment factor of the soda :)
d: the only beverage
When get sunburn mainly when i get sunburn on my scalp and after a week or so it starts peeling, I flake off the dried healed sunburn skin and keep it for a week and eat it
So... Pepsi Max is called Pepsi zero sugar in the states?
Mat hold your rat gropie waifu close to yourself and watch her.
Living in NC the winner is always Cheerwine
Bro, I feel like I am watching the news
Fritz Kola Ohne Zucker here in Germany!
Diet Pepsi always taste like it has dust in it.
He's a self made joke basically
Soda
Bro I'ma soda boi
There were a TON of mistakes regarding the seeding. MattPat frequently called a drink one seed where the picture was shown as something else. There were also several instances of announced seeding not matching up with the displayed bracket.
MatPat and Stephany moved out of LA?
I'm in Nashville, TN and the Kroger brand diet cola they sell Big K Diet Cola is really good!
1,2 k dislikes...
Me: I go with soda. All of wakanda: SODA FOREVER-
https://youtu.be/8NXEOuK2GLk
Me: reads title  Also me: EXCUSE ME
Next is your existence
WHAT
Not me actually drinking Harris Teeter Coke Zero while watching this, I can concur it is insanely good for being a store brand soda
Matt didn’t get Coke Stevia
soda pop or soda
I typically did Pop but occasionally went toward Soda and now it is almost even
People around me usually say Soda.. But I've pretty much just always said "A Drink" Anyway sorry to be the one but I hate Diet.. lol
Diet Dr. Pepper would have swept the competition
Pop
Am I the only one who got a can of Pepsi, poured it into a cup, then stirred it with a spoon so the cO2 can go away, and then drank it as I was watching? (Also, sorry for my terrible english)
You want coke and Sprite mixed... That isn't cola!! Coke zero sugar is the same as coke with less bite and carbonation
If you live in Texas, I recommend Dublin sodas. Not necessarily the diet ones, but there are some flavors that are pretty great (I seem to remember their Cream Soda flavor also tasting like cake batter? I’m gonna have to try that again...)
Wait why are people making a deal about food lion is it like a NC thing because it’s like a normal store to me
food theory:....Cocoa puffs addiction, can we beat IT?
JoJo's 12:21 adventures
"Don't be put off by store brands..."  H-E-B sodas are awesome.
this is just a marketing strategy to get coke to sponsor
Good
"I wish both of these could go through" So shuffle the brackets and try again! See if things fall the same way with different match ups
To the casual observer, Steph is overreacting. To anybody that has watched your content for years, it is 100% a legit response.
Even Rick astley will give you up
The rock, paper, scissors part was so frickin cute! 🥺
Me, reading the title of this vid: "looks like clickbait"  Me, also knowing how MatPat is in these vids: "eh, click it anyway"  Me at the end of the vid: "worth it, as usual" and spends stimmy on a gargantuan order of Diet Coke
BTW lol you can tell his brain is fried from the aspertame lol so sad actually handsome guy :(
I know *of* Kroger...But NONE of those stores are in my area...at all....sad panda...
Oh wow that's so funny. The whole time I was like "Oh it's too bad they dont have a Kroger near them. Kroger diet coke is the G.O.A.T." and yeah turns out that yall agree. Lol
18:20 This is basically grounds for divorce Matt.
FRED MEYER REPRESENT
Cola na fam i drink  tea
Poor glass bottle diet coke. Left out of the play in
They are all owned by coca cola this is marketing cola
Pop 1000% 😂😂😂
Kinda curious how the fountain drink was being stored.   Unless all those tests took less than half an hour, or your behind the scenes guy ran out and bought a fresh cup, the results might be a little tainted just by the fountain soda going flat compared to a soda stored in a bottle.
Funny how the first ad for me was one for Pepsi
All the aspertame...
Have you tried water?
Im not even a fan of soda but now I want to go to Harris Teeter
Pick up flavored sparkling water. Hydrates you better without the sugar and caffeine or whatever else, and still gives you the fizziness
Matpat might be on to something.  I went ahead and grabbed the Diet Cola from my Fry's here in AZ (Brand is "Big K"), and I think it might be the same.  Certainly tastes like what you were describing.
D: Other (Soda Pop), lol. I'm kinda sad that I can't get the store brands they tried here. I'm not really one for diet colas but I'd be down to try this kinda taste test, lol.
I've never been in a Food Lion in my life, but it's no shocker they beat Diet Pepsi. Diet Pepsi is nasty. Never mind the FDA, the Geneva Conference should be banning that stuff.
Would you consider doing a food theory about all store brand foods vs name brand? maybe include a taste test AND some economics on how much we'd be saving if we went with the store brand over a period of time?
Pepsi
To the point about in house store brand soda being as good if not better than the name brand soda (and yes, it's soda in my world) - I love Dr Pepper. HEB's (HEB is a Texas grocery store chain based in San Antonio) version of Dr Pepper, called Dr. B, is insanely close to tasting like Dr Pepper. So much so that I mainly buy Dr. B since it's usually cheaper than Dr Pepper.
Pop
B. Soda
21:20
i call it soft drink in australia
You should try berry fanta. Ill take that over root beer any day
New theory: DOES an apple a day keep the doctor away?
My husband likes diet cherry Coke zero in the Walmart brand, or the diet zero coke in the Walmart brand without the cherry
I got a food loin one county over and I'm in the northwest georgia mountains, crazy how small I thought food loin was
No matter what I call everything pepsi with a little bit of everything thing
I think I'm the exact opposite of Matpat.  He grew up in OH and moved to NC. I grew up in NC and moved to OH. He likes Diet Coke, I like Coke. He's a super successful Youtuber, and I'm super successful at nothing.
as a buckeye, i say pop
Speaking of cola. My favourite is so obscure that the only shop I used to be able to buy it doesnt sell it after the owner changed. and I would have to drive probably like 2 hours to get it. Soo well I have not had any coke in like a year or so
Matpat really reminded me of Coca Cola life and I really liked that one
Pop, Michigan
This was far more interesting than i expected it to be. Especially the end bit.
"You should try store name brand! It's surprising!" * growing up poor to where that was the only option.... 👁👄👁 *
Go drink regular coke
I never knew food lion was only in North Carolina, I just assumed everyone knew it  my life has changed
Fizzy drinks.
Im the third one. I call everything coke 😂😂✌️
If you don't like the after taste of Stevia, don try Erythritol.
Me and my friends (Scottish) call it fizzy drinks
5 mins and already a fail; like you are really ONLY going to source your DC from fountains --- and NONE of your contenders are fountain --- perhaps you just like the taste of fountain drinks better, but that's just a theory........
Let it be water
Aspartame best sweetener
The reason u love it is cause of the aspartame cause its addicting and what it does to the brain giving u more serotonin and dopamine along with a few more things its not addicting in a idk bad drug way but ive seen people who drink diet coke for so long they kind of get thirsty and are like mmmmm diet coke be smacking rb
I Stop Drinking All Sodas And Sugars.. And Beat My Cancer.. My Leg Muscles From The Surgery Have Growing Back.. I Feel Amazing And Strong.. And Heathy.. Thank You For Listening ✊🏾
There’s a Food Lion in WV
Dr Pepper not cola? What is it help
I tend to have Mountain Dew about once every couple  months. I stopped drinking sodapop everyday about 10+ years ago.
Was drinking a glass of pepsi max when this popped up.
I HAVE A SODASTREAM  I WAS INDIRECTLY KINDA MENTIONED IN A VIDEO  BUT NOT AT ALL
I have both a Fred Meyer and Smith's in town (both Kroger stores). Will try to remember to compare... though Fred's has already mostly shifted to Kroger labels. Most Fred Meyer branded items are gone.
As I was watching this I was getting ready to go get a Diet Coke
*NO I LOVE BOYLAN!* There cream soda is AMAZING you would like to try!
So the theory is that you quit Diet Coke? But hey, that's just a theory. A FOOD THEORY
strawberry lemonade Sunkist is really good
im A:pop
3:14  I’m sad they didn’t include a Code Geass reference
No, you're right Steph, Florida isn't part of the southeast, its its own weird monster planet.
I watched this video drove to a store owned by Kroger , tried the store brand diet cola and 100% with matpat
Diet RC
The fact the he just has fountain diet coke suggest this man his own diet coke fountain.
B - Soda. Anyone who calls all sodas as "Coke" might as well replace the word "fruit" with orange. "What kind of orange you wanna buy today?"
"food lion, a south carolina based chain, wich you've probbably never heard of" Me who doesn't live in south carolina but goes to food lion
I grew up always calling it 'soda'.  Despite the fact that I live in the Midwest.
I always add citric acid in my cooking, beats lemons lol.
Time is running out
Me, a Dr.Pepper Stan: I feel betrayed, but understandably so
I live in Alabama, I have all my life and only very old people refer to all soft drinks as coke. The rest of us normally refer to them as Drinks or soft drinks. Sometimes you'll here some hicks refer to them as cold dranks.
pop
I think it might depends where they are produce and bottle. It could be the water.
i wish they wouldn't have known the brackets and also not used transparent glasses, but still interesting :)
I have a soda for you Diet Pepsi
Diet b is good matpat sooo yeah
Is it just me or are there weird green bar flashes throughout the video?
pop
My first job was a food lion in your sister state. Lol also it’s fockin soda
A: Pop
D.  I always just called it "Drink" For some reason as a kid.
B
Wait, isn't the Walmart store brand called Great Value? Or is that just a Canada thing?
Fizzy drink
I always said coke, soda, AND pop. Is that weird?
Rhett and link did this first lol
Hero
Coke Zero
Soda-pop
Matpat:I quit Diet Coke    Me: NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE!!!
I've got a Pepsi max soda stream. It's actually pretty good as I hated the old soda stream diet cola flavour.
It's soda, I'm from North Carolina Steff
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I hadn't even realized those stores were more southern U.S. things huh, also grew up coke slowly a mix of coke and soda
I AM LIVING FOR STEPHS OUTFIT! She looks great even after having a baby! She's always gonna be beautiful 👉👈😳
Stevia is an acquired taste, trust me. After over 5 years of drinking it regularly. I like it a lot. It’s still not better than Pepsi though
as someone who lives in North Carolina I have to be honest food lion has some good off-brand stuff
“Matthew” I love it !
Soda
Finally an aspartame shout out! People never take me seriously when I tell them about
will say chances are fountain drinks are very inconsistant. It relies on the syrup and the carbon water to mix properly. Sometimes the fountain drink will have higher syrup or lower syrup depending on how open the line is or how much carbonated water is being sent through.
Well it’s just a theory..
MatPat: Supermarket Food Lion which you probably never heard of Me: I hope I have heard of it; I've been working there for 5 years!
Boylan sucks. They all taste like crao
I always used to say "hey Mom, can you get me some other?"
soda tbh
Switch to Mexican coke but not diet
Plastic Bottle Diet Pepsi is best hands down.
19:21 stephanie is cursed
15:29: B or C
15:32, I'm not sure what you're asking here. Are you asking what term people use to describe cola (in the context of the video) or are you asking what term they use to describe carbonated drinks in general?  For me, cola = cola and carbonated drinks = soda. SF Bay Area for reference. No one here ever uses the term "pop".
Where I live in canada the store brand is "Big 8" and it's actually really good. I was today years old when I realized stores in different places have different pops and that americans don't know what big 8 is!
20:34 I have never heard someone talk about a drink in so much detail😁😁
6:08 Florida is arguably the most south and east state there is O.o
I need to see if I can find this near my house and if not maybe I'll just go for diet coke (I don't really drink sodas ever but maybe)
15:28 Gog. Soda gog.
I’m root beer.
The odd thing is I don't like diet coke or Pepsi but I would love to try all these sodas.
"...despite Matt's inexplicable ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis..."  Me, who regularly drinks liters upon liters of Soda daily: *Are you challenging me?*
Completely off topic of the video. But cook bacon with maple syrup. It’s so good
Pop and soda are American terms. In Australia you'd call it a softie, and if you said soda people would think you mean soda water
Shasta was 13 year old 37thgungrunts soda of choice when hosting a D&D party. Local store sold them for a dime a piece and that price couldnt be beat.
I like rc cola
i live in virginia and we used to have a food lion but it was removed from the compound :(
I grew up saying _soda_ , so it's really weird hearing everyone say _pop_ since I moved further south. Same with _lollipop_ since they just straight up call them _suckers_ down here.
https://youtu.be/7CcsEUjKoq8
This is like mark and Del Monte
YOU WHAT!?
The real question is why'd you even start drinking it?
i live in virginia, and harris teeter is also the closest grocery store to my house
Stephs reaction. Thats all. Haha love you guys💕🥰
Coke is the best...
Idk about everyone else but we basically call everything not something like sprite, root beer or sunkist pepsi and you can only find coca cola canned
ᶜᵃⁿ ᵃⁿʸᵒⁿᵉ ˢᵉᵉ ᵐʸ ᵗⁱⁿʸ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ ?
Normal people : watching them pick what kind of soda they like    Me: I have those same cups
I feel bad for Steph😔 F in the chat. 14:05
B:soda
:O
I'm Irish so we would say fizzy drinks to explain what coke or Fanta is. But I know me personally, I would say fizzy drinks by their brand name. Like we'd say "can I grab a can of coke?" or "can I grab a 7Up?". That's just what I've observed growing up in Ireland.
Just picked up a pack of Harris Teeter diet cola, can confirm its great!
Personally I think diet Dr. K from Kroger is good
Publix is the best thing ever. It originated in Florida, and will conquer the grocery world. Publix is so successful, that their methods are course material in business degree classes. All other successful grocery retailers now copy Publix for things like isle spacing and shelf organization.
Tizer it's from uk
If you did diet coke, how about making a theory about "Why is American Mountain Dew different than European one?" Tastes different, but i have no clue why. I'd like to know, tho
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Guys this isn't MatPat, hes being held at gunpoint... BY PEPSI!
Ah yes, I've heard of this "soda" stuff. We call it pop up here in Canada
Yo. Drink water. Soda causes kidney stones. those arent fun.
B
I dont know why they rps it because the challenge is to find mata favo drink not his favo drink
D: Juice or lemonade
B. Soda
Other?
I've done these sort of tests with Cola myself (not diet) and I'm always pleasantly surprised with the standout flavors of Grocery store and Convenience store brand Colas. I have always enjoyed Coke and Pepsi, even Shasta, but Co-op Gold and 7-Eleven brand Colas are very flavorful and taste great too.
Stevia is the absolute worst
Ok so I just tried Big K Cola Oh.  It seems like it has the same ingredients as the Harris Teeter. It taste really good. I usually drink Diet Coke or Coke Zero, but they ran out of either one at the Kroger's and they substituted it with this particular brand. Wasn't excited about it until you said something about the Harris Teeter. I had to try it! Not disappointed!
Hopefully Diet Coke is taking it well...          ;-;
Bro how the Evan
Weird screen glitches: 4:06 8:10 9:43 13:31
MATPAT!! Not trying to tell you what to do or anything but cant diet drinks increase the risk for cancer of you drink to much since aspritane is a carcinogen that can cause cancer cells to form and weaken your immune system!!!?????
Eat friuet
Soft drink
You moved from SoCal to NC? Stop following me MatrickPatthew.
what are the green flashes 8:09
fun fact: i grew up in ohio but i call it soda rather than pop cuz my parents arent from ohio
ITS POP!!!
4:06 a screen glitch

If you ever do this kind of video again, do diet Jones soda
Soda
Have you considered just not drinking soda, because it's extremely bad for you.
Shouldn't you have used all bottled or canned soda to make this as accurate as possible?
brah!!!! ive watched matpat since he started film theory.... this is a shocker gg matpat keeping us on our feet
He quit his coke addiction
Where do you get all that fresh fountain coke for this And why even bothering with fountain stuff
I think the fountain sodas have more sweetener than the cans cause the numbers are less likely to be tracked by individuals, so they end up getting more cause it’s more palatable
Be careful with the diet sodas. My grandpa had 3 diet coke's a day for like 15 years straight and suffered a widowmaker heart attack. I mean, dude's heart LITERALLY exploded in his chest. Food for thought
In Australia we call it soft drink.  I think its overqrching for all the different flavours of soft drink or *soda* that we have. Theres 2 main orange flvrs 'sunkist' and 'fanta', then a strawberry/raspberry one from Kirks' 'creaming soda', grape is 'pasito' and Passiona is passion fruit...supposedly. And it wouldnt be australia without having 5 completely different soft drinks for 1 flavour: flavr being lemon and the brands are Sprite, Lemonade, Lift and Solo. Oh and theres also 7up.   As a kid I would generally make 'punch' with orange juice and Kirks' lemonade, or use any of the classic Golden Circle fruit juices like pineapple and lemonade, tropical punch & lemonade or golden pash with lemonade.   We do have mountain dew and coke and pepsi because america actually influnces us quite a bit when u think about it.
Stevia is such a hit or miss product. I did find some that is pretty good, but most stevia sweetened products are gross
here’s comes all the comments about everyone’s favorite local soda manufacturer, bro no one know about farmers Larry’s organic free range vegan sparkling cola bean tonic that you have to pay 8 bucks a bottle for
And "The Filler is the Thriller" so Diet Coke if he has to have Post-Mix, when out and about if he wants a can or bottle of something it's Coke Zero, and the Supermarket Private Label now takes pride of place in the fridge at home.  fortnights time the Rematch between the Champ and the Diet Coke in Glass Bottle that they where finally able to track down at Costco or some place.
Doesn't knowing the results of the blind test before the final kinda can affect the verdict? Since you are already labeling on your head which one it is? Making it easier to identify as seen on the end? It would had been more interesting to see the final reaction without knowing at all until the very end which one was the winner. The result might had not changed, but more possible biases could influence, even biases gained through the experiment. Still, interesting and fun episode, just mentioning that, food for thought.
I just don’t like diet Coke that much. It’s okay but not a favorite. Diabetic since 1970 so it’s diet soda for me. Ginger beer is my favorite.
I like how you have full competition with diet sodas and I can choose between Coca-Cola zero and Pepsi zero
here in the UK we call it Pop
Pepsi
B
I am a soda person
I had met someone a long time ago that called soda tonic...
Soda
Zevia
I'm calling it now. The final channel will actually be Conspiracy Theory
Drink Theory Juice
pop, but I'm in Canada. MatPat probably preferred the Harris Teeter because it was different from Coke. The difference in flavour, being a novelty for MatPat, is why he preferred it. I would be interested to see if this switch holds up after drinking Harris Teeter for a while or if MatPat would prefer Diet Coke again.
Maybe he's canceling wokacola
i was born in hamilton ohio so i call it pop
Am I the only one that calls it soda-pop?
I feel ya Matt. I like Mr Pibb better then Dr Pepper. And loooooove me some Dr Pepper.
we have this thing called pepsi twist  its not diet but it has a signature fruity taste to it and i think it may be almost equivalent to your choice as taste
Here in Canada we call it pop, and yet we have cream soda listed under pop. So technically, here, soda is a type of pop.
personally, the only 0 cal sugar I like is Xylitol all the other ones make me feel weird and taste really bad to me
I am from GA so it is Coke
Whose the person behind the camera
No in fact. Kroger is a terrible company run by terrible people. So of course they make the best Diet Soda.
13:30  Something appeared on the screen. Something aint right here
Just like MatPat with Diet Coke I love Julmust (it’s in Swedish), I drink like 1 liter of it almost everyday when I have it.
Now I wanna go to Pay Less to try this magic diet cola... and I don't even like soda!!!
Anyone else gotten a coke ad in the beginning?
wait north carolina? i thought you lived over in Cali on the other side of the country, omg youre so much closer, itd be AWESOME if i could meet you, a friend and i have come up with theories about FNAF and youve posted videos days later with the same theory and same outcomes, id love to meet or collab at some time, itd be awesome to meet you all, anyways, love all your theories, and love your content. thank you for bringing me the joy of watching this amazing content. Thank you!!!
I tried Shasta once. Not diet, just standard Shasta, and it tasted like they used those rocket candies as sweetner XD
A. Totally a pop person but that's a canada thing I think.
we had food lion in florida too
Who else suddenly became real thirsty watching this episode....?
Soda here in Texas
Is it my phone or is the video glitching sometimes? Like green over the screen
Other.     Fizzy drink
I'm also oddly addicted to diet Coke.
B soda
Matt is quiting diet coke how is this possible
Me: wut
Pop!
Sans is totally Nes
Wasn't the hot ones theory last year?
Shouldn't they all be fountain soda to be fair?
Freeways Diet Cola is missing :( we got that one in Germany alot
I just wanted matpat to be aware that you can't drink stevia just after you drunk something with sugar or else it ruins the taste of the stevia just letting you know in case you ever want to try it again!
Coke is trash — Diet Pepsi gang all day ah-ah-ah!
So glad you didn't end up going to Dollar Tree.
My first thought was the order of quality of the sodas, where 1 is best, and 3 is worst. I  have a tendency to go more into sodas than most as well. I kid you not, that order was: 1. Fountain 2. Can 3. Bottle  And then you basically picked the same order while testing :)
11:55 Did anyone read that as Sans??
why do vaccines and and junk foods have a lot of the same ingredients?
Wow... Finally  after so many years

I have a theory in the anime of Pokémon they say that the Pokémon are like bird Pokémon so what if animals used to be there and what happened to them
D. Other We (Australians) call it soft Drink
Spoiler slert, it all tastes the same
pop >
Of course I got a food lion ad right after they barely lost to harris teeter 🤣
Funny enough, while not diet, Kroger had one of the best tasting sodas I've ever had. Not sure if production was stopped since I haven't found it in a while, but they had a Huckleberry Hibiscus Cream Soda that was absolutely amazing. Kroger branded. Interesting to know their other sodas are killer too!
In the UK we say pop
The end of an era everybody
Pop, all the way.
CHARACTER ARC!
Me, drinking diet major melon mtn dew: Oh yeah I drink diet coke!
MatPat can ramble on about diet coke as well as he can ramble about W.D. Gaster
A fasho
Citric acid is the American MSG!
Pop pop... soda sounds dumb... also Canada say pop and I'm from canada so pop
Ginger ale, Canada Dry. Try it. You will fall in love.
MatPat, diet cola aficionado.
Me before watching this video: no he didn’t
Now he just needs to do a food theory on HEB and whether or not that grocery chain can save the world.
Pepsi max
citric acid is made from mold not fruit
Aussie here.  We call it Softdrink. As opposed to Harddrink aka alcohol.
I live in Virginia and we have Food Lion
For me it goes the best taste is fountain then bottle then can
😲
This food theory episode made me crave some of that Coke ting
C,  Steph described it exactly
This is mat pat’s dream
Diet Dr. Pepper.  Period
Visual bug at 08:10 but I can't find any secret messages in it.
A boyman is not as good as a flaming Moe. Even though both of their main ingredient is cough syrup.
When you only have Hannaford and Walmart.☹
I've got Fred Meyer over here, will have to give their store brand cola a try. Wouldn't mind finding a zero calorie soda I enjoy.
15:18 everyone I know in wisconsin calls it soda so idk if wisconsin is just different from the rest of the midwest or what
I lived by a food lion and I miss it
Is food lion delhaize??
d.  i just call it fizzy drink... i feel like thats wrong now
Soda stream looks like fucking deodorant
Pop for the most part but depends on the brand
Coca cola CEO right now: "OH MY FUCKING GODDDDDD*
The Harris Teeter one is likely way cheaper than the name brands. Will have to try some local supermarket brands.
My favorite, Summit GT Diet Cola (an Aldi brand on hiatus due to the aluminum shortage) has citric acid. Hy-Vee and Cub store brands are duds, so it's going to be difficult finding something nearly as good in Minnesota.
Why does mat seem different recently?
them: discussing whether its soda or pop  me: calls it 'fizzy drink'
Yeah, food lion has really good root beer too (even if recognizably different).
Actually soda in different countries taste different
No RC?
I understand his a lightweight when it comes to soda
what i call pop / soda is carbo witch is the official way to say pop/soda
I thought he was going to stop due to the fact it might give u diabetes but oh well :/
just soft drink, you guys in the US are weird
U WOT
I used to drink Coke zero and all a lot, but because of the aspartame I decided to switch to the zevia coke. The cherry Zeva is better than just normal.
Are you crazy
Wat the duck
D: other We call them "fizzy drinks" in Ireland usually (where I'm from
**GMM is typing**
B, it's soda down here in the desert
yea, stevia is a mistake.
Subscribers after reading the thumbnail: *Impossible* !
We call it soda over here in PA.
There's also food lion all over Tennessee
It always kind of offended me how obsessed you were/are with diet coke.
Watching this, I feel like the delivery mechanism should been uniform across the board for the best test. Cans vs Bottles vs Fountain are so different, I feel that would skew the results...
Moxie is the best soda
Yeah, me too after I heard about their sensitivity training.
so, i get that it wont fit your parameters because its a cherry flavor, but bro, check out Diet Cheerwine. i'm sure they have it in that area.
Other ..... soft drink or drink here down under
*solves a difference of opinion by rock paper scissors* only the best and most scientific methods here at food theory
I had boilers of the sodas and they are very good
I saw the thoumbmail and I thought you shaved your head and aged by ten years...
Sounds like he's about to make a food theory about citric acid
While it bombed in the Diet Soda Competition Shasta does have a good regular Cola, I know a decent number of Regular Coke-a-Cola Addicts that swear by Shasta as their alternative Cola
i think pepsi max / pepsi max cherry is the best diet drink (I assume pepsi max is pepsi zero in the US, it looks the same colour)
docta peppa or fanter are my favorite maybe pebsi
It would be funny if he tasted Pepsi and liked it more than coke
Coke Zero is not the same of Coke: Zero Sugar. Coke Zero use to be my favorite soda until they changed it, now it just tastes too sweet and chemically. It was the biggest disappointment :(
They did not make the sans is Ness meme i districtly remember "ya duh" being my reaction to first seeing that vid in my feed when it came out
why is no one talking about 13:31 (the random glitch.. unless its just me lol)
I'm D (soft drinks or fizzy drinks but I sometimes call it soda)
You should've been blindfolded, and not told which sodas were selected for each test until they had all been tested.
what's up with the 4 green lines at 4.06 ????? new matpat mystery??????
Florida may be in the southeast, but it's not a part of the South, Steph is technically correct
Oh hey Matpat lives in my old state.
No mames
This is going to be very difficult
In SouthAfrica we call it cool drink
Why tho?
Dr Pepper 4 LIFE!!!
10th or 13th seeded and not to be a critical bull but matt you spit so much when you talk

Hi I am a secret commenter most likely you will never see of find me again goodbye and have a nice day. :)
Only mat can make drinking interesting
Man I stand by Harris Teeter Diet Cola
Too bad I live on the other side of the country because I would LOVE to try this Harris Teeter one
Watch Coca-Cola go out of business in the next month
diet pepsi comes in the same options as diet coke , did you do the same test to make sure you got the best one with pepsi too?
D: Softdrink
This man really done created a reason to get paid for drinking diet Coke  😂
Pop all the way
Coke zero is DISGUSTING!
R you dad
Im a coke or specific soda (AL)
For me, it is Diet DR PEPPER because that is the only soda i ever drink
Oh can you try to make Sasparilla?
What about Pepsi max that is so good
I call it pop
We have food lion and Harris Teeter in VA ^^
I'm from Delaware and food lion is a heavy hitter ALWAYS
I was about to say I have had Boylan cola, and it is not bad by any metric possible. But then I remembered this is a diet cola tournament, and I have never had their diet cola. Try the regular cola though, quite good.
matpat: I'll only allow diet cokes readily avaliable to me.  Also matpat: Installs diet coke fountain at home to have it readily avaliable.
Why do I hear boss music 19:40
The end of an era
What is steph favorite soda
Soda !!! And in Surinam they call it soft.
B
so we're all just gonna ignore the fact that andrew garfield's on the thumbnail?
i think food theory is quickly becoming my favorite theory channel because theres never any spoilers and so i can always watch all the episodes
A I’m a pop guy
I drink 2 liters og Harboe cola light a Day this isnt good
My brother's obsessed with diet  Coke I'm obsessed with chocolate milk -
I grew up drinking and loving coke but my grandpa worked for Pepsi so I have to drink Pepsi with him PS: I’m love Pepsi it’s my second fav drink
I don’t drink Diet Coke I consume it
You should try Dr. K
Best pop ever irnbru and that's a fact
Radical soda anarchy: Call it fizz.
I have always like krogers cherry cola. Not much of a surprise for me. Rock solid. BTW, Kroger started with coffee. Might be a thing to look at, how some big companies in food came from single things that either bottom out or at some point the diversify from a good thing and stumble into a big business.
Oh my
He didn't quit for the whole 2020 remember the hot stuff video
I was happy to see harris teeter bc I live near the world’s biggest harris teeter
Welcome back to NC MatPat and Steph, as an avid Harris Teeter shopper myself, I love the Harris Teeter brands items all the time.   Unrelated, but I hope once we can all get out and about again, that maybe we will be seeing you around at some of the local fun and nerdy conventions. Like Ichiban con or Anime Weekend Atlanta.
Why don't you just carbonate green tea? It would basicly be another carbonated caffinated drink
Born and raised on calling it soda baby!
We have food lion in Georgia too MatPat
oh no, whatever will coke do now that they aren't getting a bunch of free advertising, they may have to actually sponsor the channel.
I live in Kentucky and we have Food Lion’s here as well. May be in the minority when it comes to the south, but I’ve always called it soda.
It’s soft drink in Australia
The point matpat makes at the end of the video I can sum up. Moving from Ohio to Arizona.    Ahem...     Kroger’s and Fry’s are the exact same thing
The jacket he wears in the thumbnail almost looks like Dr. Eggman in the sonic movie.
im a dlunk
17:27   Matt... Say it, don't spray it.  Edit: My god the angle, I just can't stop looking at all the glob being sprayed and filtered through the sunlight D:
I’ve been watching your channel for years and had no idea you lived in NC. Used to live down in Greensboro for most of my life
None of those kroger stores are within 50 miles of me.
For like a frame at about 4:04 there were some green bars. Was that an editing oversight? Or a new theory game.
I’m from the Midwest I say pop
Actually quantum mechanics forbids this.
It is kinda like When Denmark won the europian champien ship in foot they only Got in because someone cuoldnt make it
I had a dream of THIS exact video and watching it, the first 3 minutes of it was deja Vu.
The real question now is, will they spend less money on diet coke, or simply buy more for the same price?
I can’t believe this.
I live right near a Food4Less so I will definitely be providing input from the West Coast very soon
13:31 what is the flash mean? It was added later
You are supposed to cleanse your palates after each sip ... and it is not recommended to swallow the test... terrible. There is no theory/hypothesis without a controlled environment!!!
B
So technically, ghost kitchens produce his favorite soda now too.
Me: Chilling Her: brings me something from the tuckshop  Us: 12:06...  Me: 'So what's next?'
I grew up with calling the beverage "pop" but after living in California for a few years, I call it "soda".
What about glass bottled diet coke?
Anything but C
I bet a bunch of people will try to read code into the screen glitches, and maybe it is intentional, but to me it looks like just their camera is breaking. xD
They posted on my birthday!!!
in india we call it cold drink/soft drink
Is pepsi max, pepsi zero in America or something
They are such a cute couple! i love you guys!!!!!
*me a cultured Australian who says fizzy pop*
I would love to see how much money you saved through 2020 by not drinking Diet Coke
MatPat - The only person that can enable me to watch a TOURNAMENT about sodas. This needs to be an anime.
PEPSI ZERO IS THE BEST. . . Sorry, Diet Coke is too harsh. I will now have to find and try diet right.
I am a soda in the world of coke
We in ohio say pop
Unfortunately, Zevia isn't very good. There are some stevia based sodas that I really like. Edit: I had to hunt a bit. Virgil's Zero Sugar Cola is the one that I have found that is really good.
b
Pop all the way.
pop
Oooooh, I want some BOYLAN NOW!  (I like it syrupy)
Sam's Choice Zero Cola is the fucking jam...  I cant believe it didnt make the bracket its SO much better than SC Diet coke   Also... where in the south do you hear "what kinda coke do you want, ive lived in Texas my entire life and have NEVER heard that asked a single time"
Loved the video! Though, seeing the weird green lines popping up was distracting.  Like at 13:31  Planting some stuff for us to find Mr. Pat?
I live in NC so I know all the grocery stores you went to
Root beer
Unsubed            (Jk)
They have both food lion and Harris teeter in the DMV area but, not in new England. I love harris teeter.
wait till they find out all the flavors in europe and how different coke is in europe
Other meaning Mountain Dew!!!!!!!
Pop all the way
What Pepsi max is Pepsi 0 in the us
No wonder its 14 mins long
From the south. Called it coke. Live in SC now so I've heard of and have all these stores close 😂
From the south. Called it coke. Live in SC now so I've heard of and have all these stores close 😂
that tongue part  was truly horrid
Everyone gasp the world is ending ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Here's wishing I could find this in rural Canada. I don't recognize any of those stores
And so, Coke made a new "Diet Coke, Citrus twist," flavour and paid matpat to sponsor it.
It's awesome that some of my favorite youtubers also live in my adopted state of NC.
I can confirm that the Kroger branded cola sold at Ralph’s contains citric acid and has a slightly tart bite to it that masks the taste of the artificial sweetener.
As a North Carolinian with both a food lion and Harris teeter 10 minutes from my house, I am very surprised and weirdly proud of my regional stores
I didn't know you guys were in North Carolina. If you ever need a guinea pig, hit me up lol
Did anyone see the glitches?
Rooting for Harris Teeter just because I love an underdog story
Looks like Harris left Diet Coke "Teetering" on the brink and over the edge of failure! But that's just a pun... A SODA PUN and fizz...
Up here in the northeast i'm supposed to call it sods, but i call it pop.  People look at me weird.
What is a kroger
Boylan Root beer is the best of the boylan sodas really good.
I say cola
diet sodas give you diabetus.
LETS GOOO PUBLIX!!!!!
Isn’t Matt the one who drinks the Diet Coke, why does Stephanie decide the final choice?
Zevia is the healthiest. It's sweetened only by stevia which has no impact on your teeth or body unlike aspartame which can inhibit the synthesis of neurotransmitters, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
easy: drink water
Oh man Matt Pat I'm a little bit disappointed instead of doing rock paper scissors to figure out who won you should have made Matt behind the camera be the tiebreaker
Diet Coke was designed for women. I'm not making that up, it's a legit fact. That's why Coke Zero is the exact same stuff put in a bottle of more masculine appealing colors.
NANI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm a pop guy. Also, I clicked and watched this video because I knew how much you loved diet coke.
I can stuff like coke a fizzy drink
I never had their diet cola, but Boylan's makes my favorite birch beer, the creamy red
The end of an era
There's a store-band cola they sell near me called Merchant's Craft that's really exceptionally good.  It's got just a hint of root-beer style bite to it that I really enjoy.  Not too surprised to see the local brands putting-up a strong showing in this.
From the midwest to Matt and yeah answers is a ima pop man too.
We just watched the end of mat pats relationship
Drink Rani
I was born in Atlanta and say soda
I’m a dude who says pop
As a newbie to the diet soda game I'm sad I can't get some harris teeter out here in Iowa
Tab! Tab is the best!
I am pop.  I am from the Medina area in Ohio, where MatPat grew up!
MatPat: I QUIT Diet Coke! the theorist fan base: impossible.
We had food loin here in Texas till it got sued for wrongful meat practices.
MatPat reacting to finding out which pop was which has the same energy as the Subaru commercials where they find out the car they’re driving is a Subaru
Friendship with Diet Coke ended
I am from Serbia and we call food lion MAXI.
Just drink water Matt 😪
wot?
Here in meatball land- i mean sweden we have a section in stores with JUST SODA RIPPOFFS (and its not like like a small section no no no its 30+ rippoffs) and then its another normal section with Coke, fanta etc
Florida boy here: i love Publix, they have their own soda??????
*MatPat:* "It has to be _cola_ flavored."  *John Green:* _cries Diet Dr. Pepper tears_
My guy MatPat how big is your tongue bro..... Stephanie must be very happy ;-)
i grew up as pop
Nah all of boylan sodas bloww
Dr. Pepper is cola too!
So were going to ignore the green thing that pops up  at 4.05
Me : what did it cost Mat pat : everything
Had no idea Food Lion and Harris Teeter was from NC
IMPOSSIBLE
ccccccccc
I need to get myself good into Harris Teeter so I can have their God-like drinks delivered regularly. I'll get a second job if I have to!
try out fanta...... its addictive and 19:00 you cant do that to a maried cupple they know eath other
This guy is punching above his weight
Let's go NC
Diet rite is the best.
I grew up saying "pop" but I randomly switched to "soda" at some point and I've lived in Oklahoma my whole life.
I was thinkig about youre diet coke opsession. I have my own drink aswell.. Monsters...
Be less coke.
Who kidnapped the real MatPat?
when I was a kid, it was all pop. however, we also had cordials, which we didn't call pop, they were concentrated fruit juice drinks which require you to dilute with water first. lime cordial, orange juice, orange squash, hi juice from concentrate, cartons of orange juice concentrate, each all different drinks which had wildly different flavors, you could have 6/7 orange based drinks in the house that none tasted similar to one another, like sunny D, capri sun, hi juice orange, concentrated juice drink, orange squash, fruit n barley orange, actual oranges. Robinson's' orange juice, which tasted different from home brand names so that would also count as a different orange, each of the oranges from each store tasted distinctly different from one another as well, morrisson's tasted better than asda, aldi and lidl tasted different, the' job lot' which was an independent store had orange that tasted different yet again. iceland,  fulton foods, convenience stores, all had different tasting orange juice. Tesco's tasted more like orange peel than the rest.
FILLER QUEEN FTW! 👑
wait nobody was gonna tell me, nc born and raised, the food lion AND harris teeter are from or only here??? this is the biggest upset to  be sure
Pop
Dr.Pepper is the best soda
Matt doesn't actually think Diet Coke has zero calories right?  (Think Chocolate labeling, zero calories is just under like 5 calories if memory serves?)
WOW
MatPat should try Fentimans' Dandelion & Burdock drink!
he did the impossible
it is liqueur here in Quebec
Im pretty sure diet coke is worse then regular soda.
Best soda is no soda .soda is bad for you
not sure a bracket style is actually the best way to figure out which you like best because it all depends on what the matchups are way too much.
Diet Coke in the uk has citric acid in it
Over here in the UK, we call it 'fizzy' pop.
They said it could not be done. I can still not be done.
Coke
zevia is the healhiest
was kinda shocked when i saw the photo of the Harris Teeter I work at was pulled up
dude Publix is the best part of florida
MatPat: "I QUIT Diet Coke!" Coca Cola: *Stock Crashes*
NOOOOO! The running gag is over :(
On a related note and a heads up for anyone planning of getting off of sodas for health reasons: It is entirely possible that if you have been drinking soda for years your body might not produce enough acid on its own anymore. In order to stop having late night stomach problems I had to start drinking seltzer water. Alternatively you can regularly drink vinegar based drinks if you do develop this problem.
22:22 YES! THAT!  Please do "Private label products" episode!
Coke. Kentucky if you need that
FANTA, AND EVERY "SINAS" ONLYYYYYY  PIJTA FANTA, BADZ BAMBOOCHA!
As someone who makes my own pop and really likes the indie pops I will say its an acquired taste way better than normal pops once you get used to it though and you should try the normal cane sugar colas their much better
Other D
Carbonated drinks are known as "fizzy" or "fizz" here in New Zealand.
dont you mean pop?
Boylan's Cherry are so good.
Is it just my device or was a frame at 13:30 missing? This isn't a serious comment btw, I just think finding glitches like that are fun.
Fun fact that I was reminded of by the sodas still on glass bottles and made with cane sugar: Bottles of Coca-Cola usually found in convenience stores or groceries located in areas with high numbers of Hispanic/Latino residents or shoppers, also known as Mexican Coca-Cola, is still in glass and made with cane sugar. According to my dad (can’t say for myself cuz I don’t drink soda), the Mexican Coke tastes much better than the US.
Coke/Soda in that order - love MS
wait food theorists is a thing?
I KNEW FOUNTAIN, CAN AND BOTTLE TASTED DIFFERENT BUT NOBODY BELIEVED MEEEE. Edit: seeing matpat do the hand gestures that I'd expect of guy fierri is uh...idk man it's wierd.
I call it POP.
I am a
Just a little purposeless survey, what is the cola you drink most? I drink zevia cola a lot
Matt Patt: North Carolina based Food Lion! Me in northern VA: Totally haven't heard of it before... totally...
Diet Dr pepper⭐
I kind of really want to do this now, to see if theres any kind of diet cola that could kick me off full calories cherry dr pepper. i'd love to find a new, healthier option but I just cant afford to shop around all these expensive products i might not even like. it must be so fun to have the kind of funding to do stuff like this! definitely gonna try out heading to food4less to check out their diet namebrand stuff, though...
I’m other I call it a fizzy drink
NANI!
Yeah at my local Fred Meyers I can buy a big k diet soda for like 75 cents It might actually be the best
but... Diet Coke is horrible for you... water or tea is the way to go~
Kroger is right next to me and I got sad because I couldn't have the sweet nectar of the gods you were talking up but now I can live in peace
Plot twist the winner is just diet coke with a dash of citrus
THINK OF HOW LONG YOU LOVED IT ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hey MatPat have you done a theory on Mountain Dew you probably won’t see this but I want to know how bad it really is. I trust you and your sources and I want to know if it’s as bad as everyone says.  P.S. I love this video it was a shock hearing you quit Diet Coke 😊
MAT DONT QUIT DIET COKE
As a diabetic who can't have normal soda, Diet Doctor Pepper Cream soda is my favorite diet soda!
Soda
Pop
MatPat and Stephanie are so much the same person they can't even play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Florida for context. Born and spent time in Hawaii, only ever soda. Never heard any dark sodas being called cola unless it’s Pepsi or coke.
do the same thing for soda that you guys did for KFC chicken, find out if the "Plant Product" in coke soda is still cocaine as it did originally have cocaine in it
We call it fizzy here in NZ 😉
I’m still waiting for *Sports Theory*
Fitz (I think I spelled it right) is a really good soda. I recommend the root beer and cream soda.
Soda
idk why but to me big k cola is better than Coke
Did they clean cups after they drank it ?
So basically your just picking a different Diet Coke
good for you MatPat
Food Theory: Food Lion which you’ve probably never heard of  Me who used to go to food lion every week because it was my primary grocery store: I’ve heard about it once or twice
Diet Coke is bad for you anyways aspartame is a poison
we call is soft drink
Imagine being fucking Coco-Cola getting upset by fucking Harris-Teeter.
I never knew sodas could be so serious
Just drink regular coke
I can at least agree. Big K cola and Coca-Cola are my two favorite sodas. However I will always hard pass if the soda is diet. I heard a rumor when I was a kid about the substitute ingredient in diet cola and have never been able to get over it.  Sorry for the spam 😅
Matt, there's a special city called "Charlottesville" I grew up in. You can put Harris Teeter and Kroger brand diet colas head to head there IN THE SAME SHOPPING CENTER. You can also throw Food Lion into the mix again if you really want to. And for the non- NC based brands, there's a Wegman's too. Interestingly enough, there also a Wawa and a Sheetz, which very rarely occupy the same locality. It's sort of a Nexus for a bunch of regional chains attempting to expand from different directions.
Wha- how HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
This video makes me want to simultaneously whip and nae-nae.
We call it fizzy drink
Fizzy drink in the UK as there normally all fizy and then the flavour or brand changes the choice it's simply logical
Foodlion represent 😤
Bru
C) COKE.. I thought everyone said that..
A
Matt: you've probably never heard of [Food Lion]  Me: *stares in I do all my grocery shopping there because it's literally right outside my neighborhood in Raleigh* 😂  MVP card holders represent!!!
Royal cola is here. I wanna try the teeter now. You should've announced the choices a month ago so we could've made bets
Full theory about Citric acid??
B
Shush Root beer is the best soda
I didn't realize shasta was that bad.
The older members of my family called it soda pop. Soooooo kind of a mix I guess. I mean, I just call it soda.
My mind is so twisted as the fact that someone doesn't know what Food Lion or Harris Teeter is...
It's definitely pop or soda if referring to soft drinks in general. Coke is ok if referring to the brand (not the drinks from the brand just where the drinks come from) but is iffy otherwise because the same word is used for the name of a street drug. And Cola is a category like MattPatt explained.
soda pop, soda, carbonated drink (usually as a joke) and rarely pop
no diet RC?
I always forget that nowhere else has a cub
Anyone else catch the bits of TV static? Might be for future theory stuff on the channel.
What's with the green lines at 4:06?
pop im in Wisconsin........ YEEEEE HA
Upset that Food Lion wasn't in 4 way finale.
What was that blip at 8:10?
The flavoir
Is it just my eyes or was I seeing glitch effects throughout this video
Pepsi is better than coke
As someone who worked at harris teeter all throughout high school i love this underdog story
Drink Izze.
If we don’t play rock, paper, sizers like these two, I don’t wanna date.
Long live Pepsi Max Raspberry
wait till bepis comes out
Ich dachte mittendrinnen, ich wär in nem Hänno-Video gelandet alla
the fist 8 mins of this vid i felt fine. But the rest of the vid i felt sick. Because i had eaten cake.
Did anyone else have random flashes of colors during the video
Remember when mat pat did math in like all of his theories
MatPat, POP IS A SOUND!!! NOT A DRINK!!!!
It's not soda, or pop, or coke. It's drink
watching this as i drink mcdonalds diet coke
Oh my god, King’s have won... this is definitely something
Its hapening its finaly happening this is not a drill people stay calm is hapening
I will have you know i greet this thumbnail with skepticism
If Matt did this with alcohol.. he would get less strange looks from people than when he bought 10 plus things of Diet Coke
No joke, Matt and Stepth playing rock paper scissors was one of the cutest things I've seen!
I drink my 500ml of diet coke once a week every friday, i watch your food theory videos while doing so, today is truly a fitting day to do so.
It's POP
Soda is best served from an ice cold glass bottle. Fight me.
Soda always tastes best in a glass bottle

This was a fun one. I have something of an addiction to fizzy drinks myself so I've had to cut a lot of it out of my own life.
me in  the uk saying fizzy drink
New cocacola zero is bad
I love boylan cream soda
Food lion diet cola just how i remembered it
Not me doing a double take for the Publix soda   Hello from Florida 🤓
Gotta go to Smith's and look for cola with citric acid.
Me seeing this like: *IMPOSSIBLE*
Boylan’s Shirley temple soda is pretty good
The only soda in our house was kroger brand cola and it tasted nice. I prefer coke though.
I saw the thumbnail and said bullshit
the end of an era
👆👊 ok
8:09 and 13:30 why is there a green flash?
Borland has the best creme soda no cap
Soda. When I was a kid soda pop
My neighbor, whose husband just went into Hospice, had us buy two six-packs of Pepsi. We accidentally got diet. An easy fix, one where we got diet-Pepsi for a weak. Next weak same request. We didn't see the 'wild cherry' printed in dark red on dark blue. She said that the flavoring made her stomach upset. If this trend continues, we will have drank more soda in a month than we drank last year. Not bad flavors, but I thought I was breaking my health with sugar in my coffee. I sincerely hope she finds comfort in her time of need from our slow fall into diabetes. =D
Matt must have been in the bathroom for a while after this episode
In Scandinavia it’s just Cola or Pepsi :) and we don’t have all those off-brand ripoffs or Dr. Pepper... we can live without it, trust me.
Sadly no Kroger owned supermarkets in maryland. But I will have to check out the one food lion we have in Frostburg.
Food theory/experiment idea,  what other foods are improved  by adding citric acid!!
I’m a soda who grew up in michigan
Other I'm British
LIES
Ima whatever is said on the label man.
Who are you and where's the real matpat
MATPAT HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED, by the way iron bru is the best
Coke 😄 I’m from Texas
My dad always called it a carbonated soft drink. So, it's either that or pop.
Watch Harris Teeter zero sugar cola sales explode after this episode 😂
I like to think Matpat did this because diet coke never sponsored him
Im—Impossible!
A
3:45 ?
Boo Stephanie
Is it just me, or do they look kinda like brother and sister....
MatPat made me try Diet Coke and now I almost only drink that, I basically got a secondhand addiction to Diet Coke from MatPat. The only difference is I can’t tell what the Diet Coke came from as good as he can.
I'm from the south. It's either coke or soft drink in our language
I'm an NC native, so it makes me happy that you guys live here and that Harris Teeter and Food Lion performed so well!
This was actually an anime
Dr Pepper
Matpat won’t be able to stop Diet Coke for good lol.  Especially at places where they don’t sell his new favourite.
there is a logical reason why citric acid tastes so good to us. its because we lost the gene that produces vitamin C and citric acid hits our tastebuds triggering a response in our body that its going to get a vitamin it needs.
I grew up in texas and everyone still called it soda lol.
Zevia is really good there other flavors are better than the cola
im a soda sayer
I use the name of the product
Here in Ireland we call sodas and fizzy drinks "minerals". Yes, there's a whole story behind the name.  I'm not surprised the store brands are closer to the "big names" in taste, as they probably do very large sampling tests to ensure the taste is pleasing to the most people, whereas the "glass bottle premium" brands probably pick a distinctness in taste precisely to cater to a target or niche audience instead.
I don’t believe you
As a person who only buys store brand sodas to save on money I can say that yeah store brands are actually very good.
Diet pepsi
I have made an entire timeline of fnaf that is soo believable
It's funny how sometimes the store or off brand things/generic things are better than the name brand. Generally brand names are just better at marketing. Having watched GMM for years I can tell you Kroger Co. seems to make some really good stuff... having gone to Ralphs where I lived for a while, they had great store brand stuff and are also Kroger Co.
20:52 (Steph's reaction) Is when a karen was put back to their place.
Diet Dr Pepper
What i can't believe, is i watched this whole thing lol
what a twist
its soda in Wisconsin I've never heard pop here
You should try adding citric acid to Diet Coke.
Maybe I buy some Kroger shares after this. They might just moon 🤔🤑
My answer is c coke
in sweden we cal it läsk (soda)
I say "pop". I'm from Western PA. My husband is from NC. He just avoids saying coke/soda/pop all together. I guess I also avoid saying "yinz"...except when I'm around my in-laws. 😂
I had diabetes the moment I saw all of those bottles(it doesn't matter the didn't contain any sugar). Matpat has to poccess some super human ability to able to drink all that
Hearing yall mention FoodLion makes me so happy, my grandma is the one who wrote up the paper and got it approved to change FoodTown’s name to FoodLion and weve been huge FoodLion fans since (:
this isnt mat no its a alien
Towne Club from Detroit. Now they don't have a diet cola but they do have a diet cherry cola
Your allegiance could be for the brand that actualy will sponsor you for a change, lol
Top ten anime betrayals
i've always preferred caffeine free diet coke on flavour
Pop
In Ireland we called it fizzy drinks it ment like all sodas
That Rock Paper Scissors game was beautiful
WHAT  K[OKLHBSFBNHKL FMDZ O[XI GJKSI D/;JI .,'L HOW
15:32 It’s soda, I grew up in Sac-Town
I want a cup of diet coke now
Me: see's title Also me: *Impossible*
Karma cola. It is the best but even in the uk you can barely find it.
I'm an all of the above man.
I say "soda" because I was raised in the north but I live in Texas so I refuse to call it all "coke" but people look at me like I grew a third arm if I were to ask for a "pop".  My compromise is to call it soda.  It's like calling all pies "apple pie".  What kind of apple pie would you like? I'll have key lime, please.  So weird.
Where is the 10th seed

the boyland rootbear is delisious lol
21:06 steph looks appalled!
I was wondering when you would bring up the private label aspect, I work in food distribution so I was waiting lol. Also you're sort of correct that they could all be the same sodas. It depends on the contracts and where the stores are located as they might come from different plants, although usually the same company so it should be the same recipe. Also, good to know but sometimes your branded items and private labels are basically the same.
Me drinking offbrand "Cola". Yeah, nothing else, just Cola xD (its hella cheap and its pretty close to coke zero soooo) (one 1.5L is 1.52usd, translated. and a normal coke zero is 3,28. usd, so yeah, pretty good.
Dude this is me but with Dr Pepper I could drink a 12 pack in a day Edit:Kroger gang
13:31: haha camera co bRRRRRRRRR
Who here is watching this and doesn’t even like carbonated drinks
I am c and b
Tommy isn’t going to be happy about this one
A or b, i say either
No thanks, I'll stick to water, tea, juices, and milk.
As someone who worked at Food Lion, I'm glad to hear that it beat out pepsi!
Anyone notice the flash at 13:31
Over here in NM the state is split evenly between 'Coke' and 'Soda'. I am personally a Coke man myself.
Cheerwine should be your new Diet Coke
CANNED Diet Coke RULES!!!!! However, it must be drank DIRECTLY out of the CAN; or it loses too much fizz!!!!! Unfair test!!!!@
Publix represent!
For anyone in Texas, HEB brand soda is in my opinion better than most name brands
Pop is a sound. Soda is a drink.
What's up with that flash at 13:30
I thought Diet Coke finally sponsored him
i knew this day would come its a dark day for humanity
WHO HAD YOU HOSTAGE? WHO HAS THE GUN TO YOUR HEAD
Pick n save boiiii
Here in Canada, Walmart doesn’t have sams brand. It had Great Value brand
Called coke for sure. I kept getting upset after I moved they'd ask what I'll have to drink I ask what cokes they had. I thought they just very small options first few times
Having just compared the ingredients list for their regular and diet colas from both brands, Big K (Kroger) and Harris Teeter, they match perfectly. I think it's practically confirmed that the diet cola chosen here is, in fact, the one manufactured by Kroger. We just need a taste-off :P
At 13:31 there's these weird color stripes and I have no idea if anyone else saw it. I was playing at 0.5 playback speed and I finally stopped it on the right moment. Took me 10 min. to find it but it's there.
Anyone else notice the flickering? I just wanted to see if it was just my device or no, I care not for likes.
Mat gave up Diet Coke I don’t believe it !!!
Mathew pathew
HAHAHA I don't even like diet coke
Hey, can anyone explain that weird flash in 13:30 - 13:31?
What why it’s the best
C
im from the uk so we call it fizzy or fizzy drink
perfectly placed meme at exactly 17:00
Diet coke is worst you know that?
And just like that, I'm going to Kroger today to try out a case of diet cola and diet Dr. Pepper.  If you're into seltzer, Kroger brand seltzer is actually pretty good and it's easy to pick up on the flavoring if you've removed most sugar from your diet.
Mat and Steph: Rating diet sodas Me: Absolutely *vibing* to the music
Weres the cheerwine
who else went frame by frame trying to get a good like at the flash of color that happend at 13:30
i call them fizzy drinks, but to be fair im english so it would obviously be a bit different
Hear me out: FAYGO it might give you a heart attack but it's fiiiine, I've mixed em with monster energy and I'm not dead yet!
B
23:53 "after the amount of *coke* we ingested today"
Really cool video Mat! Uuuunnnfortunately. I dislike nearly all carbonated beverages. Even sparkling water.
#NorthCarolinagang
Mat pat what happened to you
I grew up listening to stories about how my grandmother worked in a sardine factory and also we had a neighbor later on who worked at a teabag factory - both instances were cases of one company, same products being packed into multiple different brands, i.e. "we are packing for abc company today, tomorrow we pack for xyz company."
Yay Steph!  I've been thinking for so long that's it's crazy that MatPat still drinks diet Coke!  Coke Zero is so far superior in my mind!
I use soda and pop interchangeably, and even say soda-pop sometimes. Calling it all coke is just wrong, although I appreciate the chaos of it.
in pakistan we say cold drink or bottle
I’ve never been more disgusted tbh hahaa, I’m not a soda person btw hahaa
Yo what. Did not know MatPat is in NC? Possible I could pass him then xD.
In Germany it would be "Limonade" which translates to "Lemonade" but I call it soda nonetheless, even though my friends think I'm crazy xD
I'm just sad we won't have any more Diet Coke jokes
This is CAP
c : coke zero cherry is my jam
Wait food lions aren't normal!!
You quit Diet Coke is like you quit making theories
matpat is no longer an addict
Finally
Never heard of food lion?!?!? Im from virginia. They used to be pretty big, but got bought out. So now theres no more food lions. Not in my part of Virginia anyway.... Bee tee dubz. I love all your channels.  Keep up the great work
Ours was "sodapop" But I always used soda
Soda.
I am soda. Try and guess where I'm from. (Actually don't do that.)
👁💧👄💧👁 I actually have none of those stores in my area
You know it’s scientific when they bring Rock Paper Scissors into the ring
Im from the midwest and I also call it pop
13:40-50 there’s visual bug or purposeful bug idc that much but if you’re a 110% theorist go ahead and check
Question: Does the additional flavor disqualify the winning Diet Cola? Or does the fact that it doesn't advertise the extra flavor like a Cherry, Vanilla, or Citrus Diet Cola does skirt around that rule.
C
I’m watching this on 0.25 playback speed so I can get all the information 🤓🤓🤓
Still a Zevia Stan for life 🌿
Im pretty sure food lion is more east than it is south because as someone who lives in the north east food lion isn't uncommon and i have one right near my house
Matpat noooooooooooo
Diet mtd
Kroger with the clutch upset. Never thought I'd type that sentence.
I live in the uk not usa
If you can get your hands on it, try the Swedish soda called "Trocadero". It is one of the most unique sodas that I have tried. Just so everyone knows, I am obviously biased. There is also a "diet" version of it, called Trocadero Zero
"Let me explain what flavor this is: not good." -MatPat 2021
In Ireland we call them fizzy drinks.
I'm Irish and I refer to colas as coke, lemonade as 7up and fizzy orange as Fanta no matter the brand lol
It is pop in most of canada
B
What I call soda/pop depends on where I am. I’ve moved a lot so I just know when to use either. Texas is weird tho.
It’s coke for me
Coke
Ok
Fountain Diet Coke it the BEST!
diet coke is great
A pop Midwest kid here
You can tell these two were meant for each other ❤
The video title made me very concerned 😄
can we talk about the lines that just randomly appear around minute 4:05
Diet Pepsi, Diet Mt. Dew, or other Pepsi products, Diet Dr. Pepper, Diet Cream Soda, Diet Gingerale.
When does food theory make dr Stone's Senku cola
I call it soda and I'm in the south
NOOOOO DIET COKEEEEE
4:05  A glitch shows up for a split second 8:12 Another one
15:30 I would be D because I call it Fizzy/Fizzy Drink (UK btw)
The fact they didnt have *I JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHIPPED AND NEY NEYED* in the opening for what people know matpat for makes me sad
Well this video didn't get recommended to me through the notifications so I think YouTube doesn't want you to upload this for some reason
Idk bro i really love and if i say love i mean I LOVE zero pepsi i jist love its sweetness i reallllyyyyy love  it matpat
D sodavand
The title made me cry
What’s the difference between coke zero and Diet Coke? If you’re giving up Diet Coke, why would drinking Coke Zero be any... different?
Impossible.
Does anyone else see the strangeness that is 13:30?
Good mythical morning will find it interesting that the Kroger sourced diet cola was good, they constantly like the kroger stuff when doing their blind taste tests for name brands.
Matpat: I quit Diet Coke! Theorists: *Impossible*
I watch another food channel that does blind food testing.   I've learned that Kroger brand foods are generally outstanding. In quality alone. If you consider the price it's even more compelling when you compare it to expensive counterparts.  Wouldn't doubt that it's theirs. I have no way to tell however.
14:37 Living on the east coast I'm familiar with Food Lion. When I first learned how to read I remember driving past a Food Lion and asking my parents if they sell food for lions
Plot twist: he quit because diet coke never sponsored him
I'm soda-pop myself
So for one, I would love to see the "Private label" theory episode On the other hand I am atm unaware of having Any of those grocer brands near me in Pennsylvania, so either I need to get out more, or I'm S.O.L. as it were.
I’m an NC boy. And this made me very happy
"...Food Lion, which you've probably never heard of..." I have 3 Food Lions within 30mins of where I live, heh.
I love how he sort of respects the old-fashioned company for sticking to their methods, in a "I love the concept, but not for me" kind of way
I’m absolutely positive big k diet cola is the same soda as the Harris teeter. I happened to have a bottle with me and I just tried it and the description they are giving seems so similar. Let me know if anyone else tries it because I’m pretty sure they are the same.
Did you know, that canned drinks are surrounded, by a small plastic layer inside the can?
Not drinking diet coke?.....IMPOSSIBLE
One issue with private label products is the supplier might change without notice. If Coke or Pepsi changes their formula, you hear about it. Not so much with local grocery stores.
🧢🧢🧢
I’ve been watching you for almost 9 years so I’m legitimately shocked
B:soda
Best root beer?
I know you by the guy who simultaneously wiped and nae naed
I am d, cola
pepsi max
I wonder if the HT is the same as the Sam’s Zero, because it also has a pleasant fruitiness to it. Fun video, guys.
I call it sody-water, but that is only me.
In New Zealand we call it Fizzy.
Diet Dr Pepper is literally the best
pop or soda
So you're finally taking about excitotoxins?!?  Edit... 2 minutes in... No, apparently not..
Yes 100% Soda or Pop Regular or Diet taste different if you drink it from plastic, glass, bottle, can or if you're getting it from the soda fountain at your favorite fast food restaurant.
Or you could just stop drinking soda all together.
Team Soda Represent!!!
this really is the hunger games-
C :  Coke
Mugs Rootbeer No caffeine
B soda
How is this a food theory
B: Soda
I’m a soda guy
I’m a soda guy
When you wear the red jacket you look like star lord🤖😀
15:29 well you. Got that. Right
I really enjoy the boyland cane sugar cola, but the cane sugar is such a big part of the flavor I don't see how you'd do a diet one... Suppose that maybe the old timey recipe just doesn't work well with a artificial sweetener.
I say soda
Matt I'm so proud of you for stopping your addiction!
No Diet RC? You are in North Carolina and you didn’t consider diet RC? Or more likely you couldn’t find it.
15:33 my answer is soda
I’ll get you the scope on Georgia to see if I can find Harris Teeter in Kroger :)
Im sorry but WATER is the true king of soda.
Matt ending the video:"I'LL  SEE YOU ALL...."  Me  watching YouTube while using the restroom:" oh no he's watching me! 🥴"
Also the *TF2 VS OVERWATCH guy*
And in the UK we here calling them fizzy drinks (although fizzy pop is also a thing)
As a food lion worker, I know for a fact that our store brand sour cream is the same as harris teeter. And when I worked at Walmart I found out that their canned biscuits were the same as food lion.  Both discovered because there was a mix up on the line and in both cases, one of the other store's item was in the case I was stocking.
dr k and big k are surprisingly good and cheaper soda than most. I personally like mountain dew (something about it is impossible to recreate) but K is pretty good.
NOOOO
No, Steph was definitely right. The southeast, and Florida.
my country has only coke zero
Anyone else get the "News Caster" vibe from Steph and Mat?  No? just me?😆😆
I’m a soda man myself, I’m from Florida, but past the panhandle it’s not cultural south.
Food Lion sodas in general are surprisingly good I used to work there back when they're 2 liters were literally $0.68 a bottle I have consumed so much Food Lion soda
This was the underdog story of the century
COKE ZERO STEPH LETS GOOO
so my "just buy what's cheaper" theory don't really work? well crap
You live in NC? Wow, that's pretty crazy, never knew I lived so close to you... Wow!
A: Pop!  I would have liked it a bit better if you tried the full scientific method of covered cups (for the clear zevia) and not knowing what two drinks were going into each bracket. Try and do a full blind experiment to maintain objectivity.  It was a fun episode, don't get me wrong, and thank you for all of the effort into making it.
*R A N C H  S O D A*
I'm going to my local kroger store which for me is rulers and checking it out
They're soulmates your honor
my personal favorite is grape soda
9:19 you could have used food colouring to try to tint the drink we call it generally pop. Pepsi is always Pepsi, but coke can be any cola. personally I really like Caffiene Free Compliments Cola (Compliments is a Sobeys brand). we originally started buying it for the kids with supper, but I tried it and really liked it. you should have kept the brands blind until the end, lol.
Whenever I try to explain something very simple 20:44
D: soda-pop
Pepsi Product or Pop
Pop
Mat: friendship ended with Diet Coke, now Harris teeter is my best friend
I became unexpectedly invested in the outcome of this.
I think everyone can agree that weis birch beer is the greatest birch beer brand
Hi
Legit none of the stores you listed I have heard of.
I always called it pop down here in NS canada
D: soft drink, fizzy drink, treat drink
I'm just soda
This is bazarr! Me: jojo's bazarr aventure
before i watch this ima say hes lying
What happened between 13:30 and 13:31?
Can I have money I’m your 100k liked guy
Definitely Soda
Wanna know something that's replaced a metric crapload of sodas in *my* life? Hint water. Like, no joke. This stuff's good. Their Fizz Grapefruit is very similar to how Squirt tastes, their Fizz Peach is just f@#$ing amazing, and their regular Watermelon is so GD refreshing it's not funny. Especially when cold. https://www.drinkhint.com/
Thank god Kroger is the head master it's right here next to me time to go grab me some cola
If you're North Carolinian, you know there's a Chinese restaurant next to that Food Lion and you know that restaurant always hits lol
B: Soda, but i know a lot of people who call it pop
I drink water
Hank's is the best hands down
Coke for everything
No...NOOOOOO        I suggest iron brew or vimto lol
Weird thing about this is... this is supposed to help Mat decide what coke he likes best and wants to drink... so why does it even matter what Steph likes? Isn't this kind of like a:  Mat: Gee I love Drinking Coke! Steph: No! You will drink fruit juice from now on and you will like it! Mat: Okay ;__;
Mat Pat is tapping into his inner Gorden Ramsy Also, sort of pop and Coke, Here in Texas, we use both. (or atleast I do)
I have t1d and this video is one to remember
Yeah Stevia. Is a good sweetener. But you have to use less. It is stronger than sugar. Which is why people mess up with it, cause they will put the same amount in as you would sugar. You need to put in about 1/3 or less as much to get the same sweetness. Even companies still haven't figured this out.
We all know maom colas should win
B
6:12 yeah
It’s my dream episod-a
twist ending: pepsi products allegedly have human fetus derived crystals you just drank a baby like a bride of dracula....allegedly
I recently found a pretty good cola in one of the bigger store chains in our country. It's not DIET cola but still worth trying. Fentimans Curiosity Cola, it's a botanically brewed cola that due to the brewing process actually has 0,5% alcohol content. I found out the latter just now. I like it because of its taste.
pepsi max
You missed Mountain DEW, the best cola!
I would be having a stroke from that much soda...
WHO TF ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MAT!?
What you showed wasn’t Harris Teeter brand diet cola, it was Harris Teeter brand zero calorie cola.  There is a difference, I’ve seen both on store shelves here in SC.
The fall of the king
Blue sky cola 79 cents and tastes the best
I love that you know each other well enough that neither could win rock-paper-scissors because you made the same choice.
As a child. My parents don’t let me have coke and DEFINITELY NOT DIET I was told that Diet Coke has poisoning in it instead of the normal stuff I. Coke.
Ooooooooooo spicy
A
well i really liked coca cola life but it was awailable here in germany for just a couple of months. so i am aktually interested in seeing if i can find those other cola versions since they didn't liked it because now i'm curious
Soda
So...was there no R.C. Cola that you could find?
Harris Teeter cola making it into the list by dumb luck and winning is a sign from the universe
I like this video because i love soda
Coke life was the only thing I drank for a while, unfortunately I’m pretty sure it’s discontinued now
Harris Teeter: Why the eff are we selling 15x more of our soda than the last 10 years? Gen X and millennials: Dude, up the production or sell to a national brand, already.
Matt, just switch to Moxie. You know you want to...
I’m a soda guy
That why hes so energetic, because hes high off of coke drinks
GREEN COLA
Mat: "Taste is subjective, we try not to do taste tests"  Also Mat: Which is the best diet Coke, according to me?
Here we call them mashroob ghazi which translates to gassy drink
Calling soda "coke" is like calling every human Jerry.
Loser
What happend at 8:10 and 13:30? My pause game is weak
I'm all Ice Tea lol
Wait. So WHEN did they move to N Carolina?
I always thought they lived in like LA or something like that...  Edit: just found out I could walk to their house in roughly 15 minutes  Edit 2: been there, it’s called rocket fizz.
I literally gasped when I saw the video title
I was today years old than I learnt that 'Diet Coke' and 'Coca Cola Zero(sugar)' is not the same thing.
Is matpat breaking inside???
-cackles in british~ we just call it fizzy drinks or soft drinks _or we literally just call it by name, example one of the best fizzy drinks ever, Irn Bru_
Drink water
Well, Boylan soda is accurate to the time period. Soda was originally used as a medicinal product before being used for a beverage, so it makes sense.
Anyone else call it fizzy juice?
Doubt
Plot twist: as MatPat was filming this, Coca-Cola was FINALLY editing up the draft for their sponsorship.
Bet
Try coke zero?
I'm rooting for ya man!
I thought he was going to quit diet theories phew
I can't stand stevia neither. Every breath you take after you consume it turns sickkly sweet. Horrid. For me it's always been zero coke. I'm adicted to it going strong for 13 years now.
who are you and what have you done with MatPat
Did anybody else see that glitch at 13:31? Was it just faulty editing or a Team Theorist puzzle piece....
Well I know Matt as the guy that can simultaneously whip and nae nae
Bruh
"The North Carolina based store "Food Lion" you've probably never heard of" me who lives in north carolina and is a 5 minute drive to 3 different food lions: ... (also harris teeter is the only grocery store I go to and it made me so happy hearing him talk about it)
I have t1d and I love zevia
i present coke
On a side note, your next channel should really be "Conspiracy Theory" These ARG's kinda have that feel to them, and some conspiracies have actually been proven to be true. It would be really cool to see the history and rationality behind those- just a thought.  So this episode was clearly made for an ARG. Although I don't mind the peculiarities that go with it, I wish they wouldn't go out of your way to fabricate a "filler episode" specifically for that purpose. This offers little to the audience besides reality show style entertainment - which again, IS FINE! But for a theorist/science channel? Taste is subjective, so this was essentially a wine tasting video.
We are fizzy drinks  or soft drinks in Scotland
Pop because I live in Canada
I always called all soft drinks coke (I'm from N. Mississippi) but it drives my wife insane so I just call them drinks now.
Canada = Pop!
You missed bepis
Diet Dr Pepper to rule them all!
A: Pop
I gotta see if I can get Harris Teeter cola in Florida. Meanwhile I can ask my cousin to fetch one in North Carolina........
.... what did I just watched?
no more diet coke? now you won't go blind and impotent!
Kinie can beat diet coke
There are a lot of references that only people from North Carolina will get #teamcherrycokelove
I've lived in TN all my life. Coke *products* are called coke (i. e. what kind of coke? cherry coke). Everything else is soda.
i am gazirano piće Lol
D. I call it a drink.
never thought it was gonna happen
I'm so proud of Matthew for staying objective and finding his true love. Good for you, Harris Teeter!
Coke Zero Gang!

A: pop because i am british
Mat: Me: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATPAT?
Sucralose is different than sucrose through the substitution of a chlorine atom. This makes it so your body can't break it down, but it still releases insulin. Since insulin can't break down sucralose, this often leads to increased weight gain compared to sucrose as well as the increased build up of insulin in the body giving a higher chance of becoming diabetic. Aspartame doesn't release insulin, so these effects aren't seen with that sweetener. Sucralose is even worse for you if you don't eat much sugar. If you still consume sugar, the insulin can still have a small use, but without the sugar, the insulin can just sit in your system without being used.
Honestly, unless I really look for the differences between all the types of Coca-Cola, Coke (same thing), Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and other verients of the Coke flavour, they all fast the same, but I prefer Coca-Cola, just because. Also same with the Lemonade, Sprite and other ones. Except solo, that's different. Oh and with Fanta/Sunkist/Other orange soft drinks, and all the raspberry flavours as well (raspberry Fanta /shweeps (forgot the spelling) raspberry soft drink, ect.)
did anyone see that glich on th screen
Where I come from they call a drink
I grew up with soft drink/soda
I'm disappointed MatPat...
WAIT YOU LIVE WHERE I LIVE TOO?! I LIVE IN NC CHARLOTTE
Citric acid is like the MSG of beverages - you can’t go without it. Those who are fans of Uncle Roger/Nigel Ng will know.  In terms of the question, I say soda. The only Coke that exists is the actual Coca Cola and the coke beverage.
Nooooo!!!! Diet Coke was your drink since the dawn of time!
I just started dieting and I’ve been hitting my diet Dr.pepper but I’m down to stop by a food Co and try the Kroger diet cola
*GASP* oh my gosh this is so groundbreaking
I found lychee berry soda at an international store one day . Best soda ever . Can't find it anywhere  now !!
Pepsi = coke +sprite Try I dare you
yum
I call it Soda pop and if it's coke I call it coke-
isnt food lion national?
You guys should've made it a secret from start to finish.
pepsi max
Boylan is the good shiz
How did diet coke not win
Maybe he should get a diet coke fountain dispenser...
“Soft drink” why does it burn my throat?
I really like Mezzo Mix, it's a citrus cola from Austria
Pop cos i'm british
OK, I'm not the only one seeing the screen-glitch freeze frames, right?
As someone who lives in the Shasta region, I have to say, Shasta is the go-to generic soda around here
Grew up saying coke. Switched to Soda Pop when I went to college in Michigan.
coke zero fammmm🥳
Like you, I can tell the difference in each Diet Coke Source.  I think that it depends on how I am drinking them for which is best.  Ex: if it is Cold (No Ice) I prefer the bottle, but room temp would be can, & with ice would be the fountain.  Also, I have tried the Boylan Soda once before, and I agree that it was horrible.
This is interesting, because diet Coke are  nearly not sold in Norway. Here Pepsi Max is a huuuge thing. It has even gone as far as ~70% of all sodas sold are sugar free
Diet Coke just lost 50% of their sales
C. coke because i am florida
In our place we call it Softdrinks generally
Who are you and what did you do to MatPat?!
i dont get why -us- people r so unhealthy sometimes. i just called it carbonated beverages/Soft ,cold drink.
WWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Diet Coke is like, the MattPat thing!
Growing up in Oklahoma we used to have Food Lion, assuming same brand. I won a go-kart when a store opened near me!
Hello! Fellow North Carolinian here. I literally live across the street from a Publix AND a Harris Teeter 😂
Stevia definitely takes time to acclimate to, but it is healthier than the synthetic chemical concoction that is splenda and worth switching over to.
They're soft drinks <_< And this is the case for most of the UK. Don't ignore us pls! :p
This has nothing to do with the video but I love Stephanie's shirt ❤❤❤
Team Pop
D: fizzy drinks
I'm from Central Kentucky and the March Madness thing gave me SEVERE flashbacks to 2015.
Impossible
The ruiner of childhood dreams
You could just try real cocaine. they're practically the same thing, other than cocaine somehow being slightly healthier.
No! You need the Diet Conk
They just want an excuse to drink soda
To be honest, I thought North Carolina was a pretty average state but it turns out lots of cool people live here, like MatPat and Mr. Beast
No MatPat NO
It is pop and it should stay pop
Food Lion is not just North Carolina based, they also have stores in Virginia.
seeing you both do rock paper scissors was a funny wholesome moment
We call it fizzy
Oh thank goodness I though maybe steph was trying to get his to quit diet soda
B. Soda
Admit it, yall don't watch March Madness but you made it through the entire video
as someone that lives down the road from a Kroger store (Pick n Save), I can confirm that their generic brand sodas are amazing. I have some nostalgia for them since we used to get them from the vending machine at pick n save as kids for just a quarter (which was cheap for the late 200s), but even as an adult now they're still great sodas, the cream soda is one of my all time favorite sodas. Also I'm from Wisconsin and everyone here says soda so idk what to make of that since I always hear people say that they say pop since they're from the midwest. we just must have missed that cultural wave
Steph isn't even wrong. It really is all called Coke for whatever reason
Aspartame is produced by genetic modification and has been shown to cause diabetes, mental disorders, and cognitive problems. Evident of this video. You can literally "Die" from "die"t soda. Not instantly. It's like radiation or Zantac. 30 years later and you have the cancer, or diabetes, and in so many more instances, both. Courtesy of Donald Rumsfeld and Monsanto now (Bayer). Also, plastic is toxic. Even BPA free plastic is still toxic. One of the toxins in a synthetic estrogen that screws with your hormones and other toxins make you sick, cause the cancer and other illnesses.  I replaced my Dad's Nutra sweet with Stevia and he didn't know the difference.  Since you tied six times, you should do rock, paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock.  You are probably the ONLY thin person in the world that drinks diet soda.
my fav soda is mezo mix but sadly it only exists in germany switzerland austria and the uk so mat will proly never get to drink it
Pepsi max > all, just saying
Flavored Seltzer water is a good alternative to actual soda with syrup
This is a weird thing to notice but when sitting down your necks are at the same level but your head is noticeably bigger making you taller, truly big brain
Well I worked as a pallet stocker for 3 months and in Canada shoppers drugmart, lawblaws, and no frills all use the same supplier/products, also got to mention lawblaws no name yellow box products for the generic items because if you have not seen them you need to look them up
D  Cold بارد I’m Arabic Watching you from Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦  ＼（＾ ＾）／ :)
If you haven't already you have to try moxie soda, nothing like it
i'm in the south and we never say every soda is a "coke"
pop
This post was made by the Diet Pepsi gang
I don't even like soda and I was smiling during this entire episode. Very cute. Well done.
MATTHEW!!!! NOW I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL RALPHS AND GET BIG K DIET COLA!!!!
As a broke gal, I have been a hardcore Shasta fan since I was a kid...but I *hate* colas. Their cream soda and diet Dr Shasta are the winners for me. In fact I like the taste of the sucralose-sweetened Dr Shasta WAY better than the aspartame-sweetened diet Dr Pepper!  BTW: growing up in SoCal is was ALWAYS soda...out here in Utah, it depends who you ask. Some call it pop, some soda...some go both and say soda pop!
Did anyone catch that glitch around 13:30 think that’s intentional?
D
Coke.
I call soda “crunchy water”. How about you?
another at 22:50
Me: Reads title Also me: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATTPAT
Steph’s right... Florida’s not really a southern state
Food lion is belgian
I didn’t know food lion was NC specific till now
I love Dr Pepper
Do you want paper scissors so hard 18:21
I'm from Albuquerque, NM. We call everything "Coke". My favorite fake Dr Pepper is Big K from Smith's (Kroger).
How dare you betray Diet Coke MatPat, you traitor.
B: Soda
try irn bru it is truly unique bit it might be a bit hard to get from scotland for you yankees not to replace cola but try it
I really want you to try cheerwine
In finland it is kokis😆
Me sees the title: *looks at the can of Diet Coke in my hand* maybe I should watch this later...
Pepsi is good👍
Coke Zero
C: Coke.
I in Canada, so i can't find any of those brands here.
I hope you Quit SODA matt patt. it's terrible for you
In the U.K. we call them ‘fizzy drinks’ because we’re all about being direct 😂
B: Soda
Matpat food lion is in North Carolina me in Maryland with a food lion next to my house
Matpat You forgot the  DIET coke from LIDL {LIDL is a German grocery chain}  Yes there is a LIDL in north Carolina. And yes LIDL would be excluded from your Supermarkets are cheating you video
What does the seed mean
Who else saw the glitch on time stamp 13:31
Fritz Cola from Germany is pretty good
Everyone's immediate reaction: "Again?"
13:30
I am from north Carolina lol
I dunno if the recipe is different between US and UK but I can't stand 99% of diet drinks. Though I drink soda as a treat not on the regular and if I am treating myself I go full sugar. I spent a lot of time in the US and was so surprised that they don't have dilutable fruit cordial there, it's like soda or that awful coolaid stuff
I think Steph's "and Florida" at 6:08 was her blocking "Southeast" into "South".  As in Deep South.    Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia are the absolute core units of the group. Arkansas, Tennessee, and South Carolina are huge forces in it.  North Carolina is more mixed, and Texas is a bit different because...Texas.  Florida panhandle belongs, but most of it doesn't.  Bunch of misplaced Yankees.
Fizzy drinks are what they're called over here, in England.
In this part of England we say pop
I can only assume their taste buds are just so different that they cant agree on 1st and 3rd but I can also assume that they are the literal perfect match with barely different brains.
I’m a C kinda guy probs cus I’m from the uk lol
Thay did not add Dr.papper becose all other drinks would lose
sometimes im just like... how the heck does Stepth's brain work... like she just comes up with some of the crazies facts from nothing. or like here "oh this obvi contains this and this is worked like this" and like in the frog game she looked at the scene for like one second and goes like "oh well obviously it works like this and adds this and is solved like this." I'm just really fascinated with Stephanie and her brilliance really.
i-
Texas- coke haha
I just call it whatever the brand is called.  So for me it’s just some type of lemonade.      I’m just realise my soft drink tastes are basically discount MatPat.
Me: Reads title Also Me: This is the worst thing to happen in the 21st century ever
For people who don’t know: Regular coke is better for you than Diet Coke since artificial sugar is mostly worse or exactly as bad as normal sugar. 🙃
Pop
Midwest, it's typically pop. I would sometimes say soda just because it irked my friends.  As to the conclusion - I'll be curious if MatPat would change his mind after some time has passed. Maybe Harris Teeter is the best, or maybe it's just the flavor of the week (I write as I sip my Diet Coke).
KU is the best in March madness, COVID ruined it this year. No one can change my mind
We call it in uk pop
oh i don’t know how about NORMAL FUCKIN COLA?  (this is jöke)
Cola is best out of the glass bottles Change my mind
In the UK we call it a fizzy drink
The fruity ones also often contain hibiscus extract. That's the real magic.
nooooooo diet coke
How is this not trending
I'm from Michigan and we call it pop
I can't believe I just watched you drink soda for more than 20 mintues.   I don't even like cola 🤣
Fun Fact: MatPat went to Duke, a school that while being academically prestigious, is often better known for their top tier sports programs, specifically basketball.   MatPat saying that the sodas were going to “duke it out” wasn’t just a silly pun, it was a shout-out to his alma mater.
CHOOSE PEPSI
in Malta we say soft drinks mostly.
Steph looks so surprised at matpat’s final decision
Something was honestly really off with your Boylan's. Boylan's is by far superior to any of these brands, and tastes most similar to Mexican Coke, which is universally known as the best. You had a spoiled bottle my guy.
Ill have u know that i am non-binary coke pop
The most intense rock paper scissors match ever
This video: happenes Next video: no more FNAF
Hey Matt it's been 1 week without diet coke Matt: Shut Up!... Just Shut up.
me, who's drinking diet coke when this pops up in my recommended:
Can you please be cola gordan ramsey more
*Dr. Pepper  IS BEST.*
For UK folks: May I recommend the store brand zero cokes from Aldi's. The cherry zero coke is especially nice and at half the price of the regular brand Coke.
everyone will hate me for this, but:                 i prefer coke zero over normal coke.
Mrbeast fans who watched whatever you can carry I’ll but when matpat said “you’ve probably never heard of food lion” puts on sunglasses
C. I grew up both sniffing and drinking coke

They're soulmates. They're literally soulmates. Stephanie and Mat-
Fanta
Or you could just... drink water...
Me seeing MA in the description: MASSACHUSETTS
I’m D. Technically we say “soft drink” but I personally will shorten that to “drink” and everyone In my family does the same. (Super close to NC is where I am)
Sodas taste so the best in glass bottles : D
It's quite surprising that you guys didn't like the stevia. I make my own hot chocolate mix with stevia and it is literally the best thing in the world. That said, its not very good unless you get the higher-quality stevia that's kind of expensive. So I guess the companies used cheaper options?
judging from their ads, I wouldn't have guessed Kroger making good cola
Me, who loves lemonade: maybe I am *matpat*
WAAAAAIIIIITTTTT! YOUR IN NC? Im In Asheville. Thats amazing!
Honey just start on the club soda route!!
What do ya’ll call it when you mix everything together?  I grew up with “wild Indian” then later “a suicide”.
They were all minerals to us growing up but we never said the general terms. Just called them by name
Make the jump to flavored seltzer. I'm diabetic and sensitive to fake sugars (they induce hydronephrosis) so it gets me what I need. Ah-Ha brand has two flavors that even include caffeine. 0 sugar, 0 salt, 0 calories, and no fake sweeteners.
Alright.. Next time I go to the U.S., I'll ask for the "citric flavour Harris teeter" soda.
in the UK you just call it whatever it is. eg, 7up is 7up, coke is coke.
B
As a Pennsylvanian, I didn't realize Food Lion wasn't a national chain. We have them all over.
Me when diet coke:
Coke.
I can't drink 'diet' anything and now even the regular versions are full of artificial sweeteners. I can handle Coca Cola life from what I remember of trying it once. I have been drinking sparkling water for 2 years because I can't afford full sugar drinks anymore but I love the carbonation lol. Sometimes I add concentrated juice but its not the same.
17:36 bfb when
Ive actaully heard of food lion. A food factory i used to work at in Illinois of all places made some of food lions stuff
Try Wolf cola, it's sponsored by Boko Haram!

Coke Zero all day!

you know they mostly get citric acid from fungus these days, as the most acidic citrus fruit just has nowhere near enough acid in it to be a viable option to farm.

If sams club diet cola fails...  I’m going to be disappointed
I just noticed that kevin from the office is in the intro
Me realizing how close I live to a famous YouTuber: .O.
i wonder if since humans can't make vitamin c, that we get a dopamine reward from citric acid because it tells you you're about to eat something high in vitamin c?
12:16 Leafy when .
why do 4 green lines flash across the screen for a frame at 4:06 ? just as matt gets to the 'k' in 'ask'
Steph just lowkey jealous that Mattpat stalks diet coke more than her ;)
4:06 did anyone see that green glitch ?
We call it bubbly
A: Pop
I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that there key difference between diet coke and coke zero is also citric acid.
Everyone knows they are called fizzy drinks not soda or pops or especially not coke
If you choose Pepsi you'd be enjoying a similar flavor while also spiting Coke for all of their past transgressions.
0 calories doesn't really have 0 calories
YOU FORGOT ABOUT FILM THEORY
Diet Coke is awful I never wanted to say it but it contains stuff in it that makes non diet more healthy
I say soda
11:49 NO NO I'M LOSING IT LOSER FLAVOR WHAT WHAT LOSER BFB WHAT WHAT WHAT LOSER FLAVOR WHAT
MAN MATPAT SHOULD PROMOTE WATER!!!
Are you sick, do you need medical attention, maybe you have covid,
i use soda in english, brus in norwegian, and läsk in swedish - i am trilingual so i need terms in multiple languages
Us in Canada just use all the names for pop and soda interchangeable!
I know a soda at dollar tree but I dont know if there's a diet flavor it's called Shasta cola
fizzy drinks. they are all fizzy drinks. does that tell you where I'm from? edit: on that note, It would be pretty interesting to see them rank Tesco and Asda cola against the whole list
... I don’t think I ever released that Food Lion was a southern store. Lol
Pop, it's pop.
from my limited sample of pepsi max, coke zero and coke zero sugar (both coke zero recipes taste about the same), i must say that i agree with steph and that CocaCola Zero Sugar (or Coke Zero for short) is my personal favorite - and i also live in Sweden and Kroger seems to only have stores in the US, so i can’t exactly get my hands on any of their soda, so i can’t try the MatPat choice
Zevia flavors vary widely. Some taste pretty good, and others... don't.
Lol! We switched to HT brand diet cola when we moved to SC six months ago and it is the first diet soda my hubby ever liked.
D, I like tea
Drinks from fountains/machines taste different, ofter more flavorful because they come out the machine as straight syrup and soda water. This way the machines don't need to be refilled as often and they only need the different syrups instead of full chambers of pre-mixed drink.
Oh snap. Didn’t realize they were with me in nc
Pepsi max superiority.
If any foreign theorists ever come to Czech Republic, we have our own Coke-like product that tastes kinda different, but I personally love it. It's called "Kofola" and I think it does come in a sugar-free option. Definitely recommend, to me it feels like it tastes more sour, but I'm not good at describing taste so don't take me literally there.

20:53 : Diet Coke: Am I a joke to you?
I'M ALLERGIC TO CITRIC ACID
coke zero is better than diet coke
me: Its st E via not steevia
I have a suggestion, Water
I forgot Coca-Cola life exists, havent had one in years because it was taken off the shelves from Finland like way back ago, at least 5 years ago.
I’m British and we call them fizzy drinks, i think we call them pop and coke too tho :0
Just do carbonated water dude. You absolutely DO NOT want to have anything with Aspartame. If you need the sweetness, get things sweetened with Erythritol. Stevia is just a terrible sweetener. Also, sucks we don't have Harris Teeter here in Canada (at least not where I am) cause I'd like to give that a try...
B: soda 🥤. I'm from Denmark 🇩🇰 where it's called "sodavand" with mens sodawater 🥤, so it would be natul, for me to say soda.
Yo i know food lion but in Europa it's called Delheizen
None of those markets are in my area, but I'm also too lazy to do research. I don't drink sodas anyway. Why am I here again?
im pop
if you were to use a random number to tiebreak the rock paper scissors, for example your browser’s Ctrl+Shift+I then Math.random(), you would probably get 0.5 as the result because it returns a value between 0 and 1
Luckily I live like 5 minutes away from a Harris Teeter
Its funny that I watched this episode eventhough I don't like soda
Looks like Stefany moved from Gtlive to food theory
There you have it folks.
D: Fizzy Drink
Now please get sponsored by Harris teeter
Coke and soda are interchangeable for me and my family from Georgia. But when I was younger it was all Coke unless I wanted a sprite. XD or a ‘Bepsi’ as my 4 year old self used to say
D. XD im ne american
In the UK 🇬🇧 we call it Fizz do I guess where a D
parents always used pop but I always called it soda, so I don't really know
Finally!!! I always hated hearing our beloved mattpat killing himself with Coke 🤮 just get zipfizz its soooo much better!
The “food lion” has the same logo as delaize of Belgium
Am I the only one that noticed green bars flickering periodically throughout the video? Like at 13:30-13:36 it happened
I adore the taste of Zevia. But I won't touch anything they put cherry flavor in, cuz that stuff is straight cough syrup.
I’m literally drinking Pepsi max wile watching this 🤣❤️🤍💙
Try lime Pepsi
13:30 what is this little screen glitch on ur video?
Nobody gunna talk about the screen glitch at 13:30 or was it just me?
Native Floridian here growing up for me a group of soda was called just that soda other then that they were call by their name or in a restaurant you would be asked what drink you wanted and then you'd name the specific drink. Never heard of other drinks being called coke before though just coke itself
You missed sprite
Wait, that’s illegal
Lol yes lets go Zevia Cola is actually my favorite drink ever lol
Hmmmm idk
My Dad is actually allergic to sucralose and stevia
Coke Zero  all day

Glad your so open about this.  And willing to keep an open mind even when you have a bias.  Also is there anyway Matt pat or someone from his team could reach out to MXR they just released a video dealing with issues with merch.  I know mattpatt talked about building something to help other you tubers and fans out.
Pop
Turn on Close captions and start at 3:45. Matpat is a little more than we originally expected
diet mt.dew is great and if i remeber correctly 0 calories and 0 sugar
Imagine MatPat in newer videos instead of mentioning diet coke he mentions harris teeter Idk but it won’t sound right in my opinion lol
The macabre ant undeniably fence because wolf traditionally snow on a idiotic bestseller. petite, profuse foam
Is it just me or is any diet version on the origional soda actually much more unhealthy then the origional.
MAT HOW COULD YOU DO SUTCH A THINGTOO DIET COKE!!! (Tho i do recommend Pepsi max :3)
I like food & drink reviews. You may like or even get used to the somewhat sweet taste of Coke Zero but as was proven if another diet soda adds just the right ingredients to the mix, you can get something spectacular!
Hi guys: we have a new patient his name is MatPat Everyone else at Diet Coke's Anonymous: Hi MatPat
Best Duo of YouTube History, hands down
I'm in "pop" country, but I'm OK saying pop or soda.
Who are you and what did you do to fatpat
Having a father that made homemade root beer, and the old style cola tasting like cough syrup checks out.  Either way, random fun fact, if you don't get the blend right when making soda the old time way it can explode old style glass bottles i.e. like Grolsch beer bottles.
3:45 i realize you said “pouring”, but i had to rewatch this segment three times to understand that, as initially i heard the same thing the captions did
PA Coke.   Let’s run a test for MatPat. Everyone who sees this comment, reply ur state and what u call soda. Pop, Coke, Soda, or other as he said. :)
Coke

Hey Matt, Food lion isn't actually that small of a business. They are a subsidiary of Ahold Delhaize which is a huge supermarket chain which owns different brands all over the globe, but is based in Belgium.   I do think it would make an interesting video actually showing how supermarket's structures often works and how the same product gets labelled differently depending on which store it goes to.
Me: **Sees thumbnail** "No! This can't be happening!"
15:27 I call my bubble juice, bubble juice. This sentence is grammatically correct but it's wordy.
Coke 0 is amazing and you should pick it  Edit: it just beat diet chasta! YAY!!!!  Edit: coke 0 beat sams cola! FINAL 4!!  Edit: coke 0 and Harris teeter both moved up to the final round. It might win  Edit: mat pat said Harris teeter but steph is team coke 0
I'm a coca cola because mexican
Plot twist: this video is sponsored byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Harris Teeter 😂
here in Canada we call it A: pop
but why diet?
3:46 captions
POP
I'm not big into soda at all but how do you prefer the fountain soda? I absolutly hate how it's just sweet and watery with almost no flavor. Maybe you just have better fountains in the US since you drink so much soda but I never even consider ordering soda at places with fountains.
Water
Caption: I QUIT Diet Coke!  Me: *Impossible...*
The comment at the end “we had tasted so much we knew which was which” really exposed the flaw here. They never should’ve known any of the products until a winner was chosen. There is sure to be unconscious bias knowing the brands by taste. Where if it were entirely blind the results might’ve changed at any one point
Water!
I almost never shop at Smiths, but now I might just have to so I can try their (not) Harris Teeter soda.
In the Philippines and here was a restaurant i went to and they had PEPSI-COLA bottled for drinks, and to be honest it tasted pretty good. It was cold and was refreshing
My favorite is Kroger diet coke, that has citric acid also.
I feel like they also just don’t like cane based drinks
Idk why hes addicted it literally tastes like penny water
13:27 whats with the green flash?
Atleast matpat is not addicted to beer 🍻 that is good
I'm in the UK and call carbonated drinks fizzy, so like do you want some fizzy?
18:53 Fight of the theorises
i am pop
Diet Faygo
Drink? Soda. We have Coke products (and/or pespsi products). Food Lion brand products have to be cheaper than Harris Teeter at least! Side note: Publix must be encroaching on HT customer base! 🤔 Now that's a match up!
Did anyone else see the weird glitch at about 4:05
Me after reading the title: IMPOSSIBRU!!!
Mat Pat, soda once sent me to the ER because I abused it like alcoholics abuses alcohol. No joke.
"...that signature diet soda flavor..." yeah it's called bad, lol!
i love pepsi
Coca Cola profits have dropped by 70%.

Aspartame has been linked to cancer causing compounds in some studies at independent labs. Which is why its illegal in some countries. Also, some companies that have been told to stop using it still use a similar chemical compound in their drinks. It still has the components that cause cancer.
M O J I T O
When I walk into restaurants they are always asking me what kind of other I want, and I usually say coke
Harris teeter and food lion are in Virginia as well
MatPat reacted to Johnnie Ryan with the Kombucha meme faces, lol
Oh snap! How did I ***not know*** you were in NC? Crazy thinking you could live just down the street from me.
"Siri, buy stock in Harris Teeter"
Malted Battery Acid.  All of it.
I am addicted to 7up drink DONT JUDGE ME!!
I’m wondering why mat doesn’t like regular coke
A: pop
Did anyone else get a glitch on their screen at 13:30????
Why not try cola from around the world to see you what is the world's greatest Cola
OMG THEY ROCK PAPER SICCDORED 6 TIMES IN A ROW DOING THE SAME THING
My disdain for Kroger as a former QFC employee outweighs my love for diet cola.
Diet Dr pepper
Not a fan of all the different cups. Since all your colas were not from a glass bottle. All tasting should of been from a glass cup with no plastic straws.
_I saw the notification and i just screamed: _*_"HERESY!"_*_ out loud_
Mat I live in va and there is a food Lion literally down the street welp the more you know love the vid btw
In my region anything in bottle that has a cola tinge is thumbs-up
Plot twist: he didn’t quit diet coke
ok
Me, drinking a Diet Coke: * *spits out nervously* *
Not finished with the video, I'm just confused why Matpat got the fountain Diet Coke when all the other diet colas come from glass/plastic bottles if I'm understanding correctly.  That seems like it may be an unfair advantage there potentially.
Most of the old school drinks are normally more bitter than newer ones
We got so much lore, his first name, his new favorite drink, and the state he live in.
I’m Coke Zero all day. Use to be a Diet Coke drinker.
CANNED DIET COKE IS THE BEST
I was going to suggest the Kroger brand, but it seems you might have it anyway XD
Fountain soda is only as good as the employee in charge of monitoring it and making sure the syrup doesn't get too low so that it doesn't taste like soda water with a drop of syrup in it.
In Saudi Arabia we just say Pepsi, but with a B. Bebsi
Try Jarritos.
Hey Matpat, I like what you are doing with the channel! Congrats on another great success! I was thinking of a theory you might be able to do on the channel, and it matches up with the current climate of things in the world right now with everyone at home. You think you could do a theory on why people mistake boredom or thirst for hunger and eat when they really don't need to? I think it would be really enlightening! Anyways thank you for the epic content, and I can't wait for future episodes of not only food theory, but also game and film theory too!
I never thought that this video would exist
I call it fris/frisdrank since I'm dutch (it means fresh drink
My dad loves Diet Rite, unfortunately they seem to have all but disappeared in 2020.
My mom got apartame poisoning from consuming too many diet sodas and sugar free products. They were causing the same migraines, heart palpitations, and joint pains for me when I tried them, so I had to quit. Be careful if you consume a lot of aspartame. Be aware of your body's reaction to what you put in it. Women are more sensitive to this chemical than men are. Stay safe out there.
That’s so cool. Even when you disagree on the main thing you guys are made for each other.
You’ll be back for it
Okay but fr fr Harris Teeter fucking SLAPS!!!! The best grocery store in the universe 😎✨✨✨🎉
Oof
I think I call it soda more often
I'm on team Coke Zero!
Hey I noticed all the flashes in the video is there an arg currently going on? and if so where do i go to join in on it. what is the first step? and what website is keeping track of the current clues?
Diet Sodas are for people with broken taste buds. That or they've never tasted full flavored (regular) sodas in their entire life....or they're psychopaths 😉🤪😆
Pop all the way
Soda all the way baby
U shud trie green cola
Does this mean you'll never be sponsored by Coca-Cola?
Matpat knows his crack!
try the boylan cherry or grape.. they're both killer
I suppose this shows more, the fact that after having a palette destroyed by years of "syrup" abuse,  they just can't handle actual ingredients.
Diet colas are worse for you because they have acid that can be deadly.
We in Pakistan say soda drink.
Shame y'all didn't go to Aldi. Their diet cola has a delightful anise note.
WHY ARE YOU QUITTING DIET SODA WHAT :(((
Soda
Whelp, going to visit Kroger on my way in to work~ brb
WHAT :(((
Wait- I see Zevia! Zevia is great. The root beer Zevia is better though xD
Didn’t know we were watching gmm with a new cast.
I dont do diet drinks *except* diet coke since my grandfather always kept some in the house as his drink of choice. He died last year on Dec 28 due to covid and now i crave it more than ever
It’s all coke
Who else hates Diet Coke because it tastes weird
diet sodas are actually more unhealthy that regular sodas, so I wouldn't recommend going back to drinking it
I really love food lion brand Dr. Perky.
Which soda will please the diet soda god.
Food lion is in georgia as well
me: aw i wish i could try the soda but im in california :( matpat: Don’t fret! Try any of these Kroger chain sodas and it might be the same! me, remembering the Ralphs in my city closed 15 years ago: guess i’ll perish
There’s a Harris teeter right near my house and I will definitely be trying their soda brand - I usually go with ingles but I’ll have to see how this compares
Doesn't help those of us in England orz
what!!!!! MAT PAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SPRITE
the end of an era
0:38 IT WAS YOU THAT MADE THE BEST MEME
Boo!!! Harris teeter more like Harris cheater! Having citric acid in it essentially turns it into orange FLAVORED diet coke. NOT A FAIR FIGHT!
Soda FTW
Kroger owns fry's?!
Amateur... let me educate your meagre Diet Coke palette :D  Diet coke also tastes different per country due to different countries using different sweetener (you mention, but still). For example, i love Australian DC (Aspartamine), but hate Malaysian DC (Splenda)... because of the sweetener is different... BUT IT GOES FURTHER See, different countries also have different water sources, and the water source itself can determine the taste of the Diet Coke. Sometimes the water is from the mains, thus is pre-treated, other times it can before a bore, which will be determined by the mineral composition. BUT THERE IS MORE Diet coke has a shelf life of about a year before it goes bad. During this time the optimum age is 9 months before the "use by" date. however usually it is not on the shelf till 6 months before the use by date (depending on location).  As you go from 6 months to the use by date the taste gradually gets worse, and this is exaggerated by heat. two Diet cokes the same age can taste different if one was left in heat, even if both are chilled at time of drinking.  So... you appear to be missing A LOT
MatPat: Which do you say, Soda, Pop, Coke or Other?  Me, a Brit who just says what the product is:       '_'
Alright mate i got a few recommendations for ya number 1 barr cherryade number 2 barr cream soda and number 3 basically any of the maine sodas just look these things up and you shall find it
I live in North Carolina 😯
Yeeeeessssss the upset!!!
I love this episode.  I am a huge Coke Zero drinker and this has made me want to try my own tourney.  If fairness to everyone in the Diet Coke bracket, fountain soda is ALWAYS better and Diet Coke went into this tournament with a decided advantage.
SODA man myself
When matpat got rid of his addiction to diet coke i was like *round of aplause gif meme*
FATE! IM TELLING YA!
15:29 im gos wich is icelandic
Soda here in Maryland, and we have several food lions here! Didn't know it was north Carolina based.
I live in SC just south of MatPat and we have Kroger,  Harris Teeter and Food Lion, I am not a diet soda fan but I can say Kroger brand soda is IMHO better than big labels
I call it spicy water
I thought they lived in LA oops, its nice to see popular ytbers live in normal places  also this makes me really want soda
Matpat: "Publix is a regional grocery store specializing in the Southeast of the US" Steph: "Yeah, in Florida"  Me: *Bursts out in laughter, understanding the joke*
:D other, I call it a soft drink
Pepsi Max is best
I don't know if anyone else saw this but at certain sections of the video (4:05 and 13:30) there are flashes of colour running across the screen. At first i thought it was corrupted editing but then it happened again. Might be something to look into if your interested. Although i'm still not sure if it is a glitch or intentional design
This turned into ASMR way to quickly
I'd try the local Kroger subsidiary diet cola, but we've been out of stock of it for like a month now.
B
im a brit so it is fizzy
coke
I don't think the Kroger info helps me up here in Canada but you choosing a store brand does validate my choice, Big 8 diet cola for the win, for me any way
Welp, guess I'll never taste this "Godlike Diet Coke", living in France and all that
If you really want to try an awesome cola, try Fritz Kola from Hamburg, Germany. The diet option is (almost) as good as the sugared one, but – oh boi – the amount of caffeine is insanely satisfying. TRY IT!
I'd suggest Olipop and Poppi if you don't want something as terrible for you, but also still want soda.
Did u drink water between each round to have a clean pallet
I grew up in Virginia so I call it soda, but living in Utah, they call it pop.  And yeah, as to a Carolina local brand making it to the finals,  that's not surprising. Southerners know their foods and drinks obviously.
Drink Coca Inne
Dude stop drinking diet drinks they are horrible for you
as someone who lives in NC, i can confirm that Food Lion has decent sodas. edit: I also say soda. anyone who says differently is insane
Try crack
I really hope he quits diet coke, it tastes terrible and is so horrible for you.
Growing up in the south I never heard many people refer to soft drinks as coke, pop, and soda.  I mostly heard people refer to soft drinks as just soft drinks.
Part of me wants to run down to Kroger and grab a generic diet cola, but then I have to remind myself that I haven't drank soda in years at this point and it will probably taste disgusting to me.
My favourite diet cola is Coca-Cola no sugar.
hear me out the best drink you want is   *water*
Kroger's copy of Coke Zero is where it's *really* at
Hey can you try which soda is the best around the world? From Denmark, you can try both SchwipSchwap and Faxe Kondi :D
WHAT NO! ill have to see if the title is true no more diet coke?!?!?!
Pop
Drink turkish cola
Good Mythical Morning also finds Kroger brand products to be better than the name brand product.
Plot twist : harris teeter is just a rebranding of diet coke with added citrus
Wait... who hasn't heard of Food Lion?
Who ever decided to put citric acid into harris teeter is having the time of their lives now
Soda
Matt concerns me. Why he gotta choose the most unhealthy cola. It’s like he’s trying to melt his intestines.
im from Ireland so i call them fizzy drinks, ye i know im weird
Soda!
Mat says he's a 'pop' guy... but calls it soda.
Im watching this on break at Publix
I like the carbonated fruit ice tea because it costs 30 cents at most
BIGGEST CLICKBAIT
Paulaner spezi from germany
We just call it drink
I say soda, but I think it has something to do with the amount of syllables and how it just sounds. Pop has different meanings, while soda is just soda.
Matpat: *decides to quit Diet Coke* Everyone: It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.
Just me who noticed the glitches or was it just my screen?
Looking at the tittle and being a theorist fan for many years, I though "This is clickbait ¿Matpat quitting diet coke? nah" hahahah
B
Its that citrus love
Soda for me. And I agree with Matt here, calling it coke would make it confusing. Love this episode.
StEeViA  It’s Stevia, not stēvia
Matpat: Chooses storebrand cola that wasn't supposed to be there instead of Diet Coke    Me and Steph: Wait thats Illegal
UK we call them fizzy drinks
What is with citric acid???
In Kansas I've heard it called Sodapop
Noooooo
I very much enjoyed this video.  Amazing outcome.  Thanks yall.
ice tea brisk and Nestea
The God said ,,top pop" and and the Word jokes have started.
Fun fact: that blue can, the Zevia, is actually 100% allergen free, including even corn. My mom has a corn allergy and it’s the only soda she can drink. I can’t stand it because it’s *Clear*, and my brain eff’s up the flavor, but she says it’s great.
There's a supermarket chain here in Spain called Mercadona which has an own-brand range called Hacendado, and they do a fantastic Cola Zero which I'm pretty sure is a variant re-labelled RC. Absolutely love it, it's got a slight lemony cherry twang to it. :) Also, it's 55 eurocent for a 2L bottle, which is just nuts.
Pop I grew up in eastern Canada
in NZ we call them soft drinks
When will the fnaf related food theory come
I’d eat at MatDonalds
I call soda/pop/coke/soda pop all/any depending on where I am or who I'm around, I don't consciously make the decision it just happens lol
Food Theory is doing a History Channel.
i am a milk person. Milk is good. i think i am 90% bones the other is just organs meat and skin.
Should've tried Fanta smh, best soda no cap (pun intended)
D! Im from sweden and here we say läsk
Zevia was my replacement for soda but it was kinda pricey to keep drinking.
I'm from MD, and i had a food lion before it went out of business n became a Weis
A
D: other, I'm an Australian and we call it soft drink here
anyone know what's up with the green lines at 4:06? and 8:10. Seems like video corruption.
Sounds like its a Wine tastning
i'm кола 15:23
MatPat Ramsay
As in Pennsylvania i heard all verions for the code names on soda
when you find out MatPat lives 3 hours away from you
If only they had a third person there to break the ties. Oh well guess we will never know Matt(s). Also my part of Missouri is Soda. Along with Coke Zero being amazing I’m glad it made it so far.
green cola has zero calories, caffeine, and sugar, its made with stevia leaves and is awesome
It's convenient that I live in SC because I recognize all of these southern brands lol
Monster ultra
Waiting for the harris teeter sponsorship
Matpat: I quit diet coke  Everyone: *Impossible*
Other
Soda-pop. Fight me.
I am from the Midwest and I say soda, not pop
Cola is the worst flavor of Zevia it sucks that they were only doing cola
As someone that has just as sensitive taste buds for coke, I recommend you try diet coke from around the world. Cause even the water different countries use changes the flavours quite a lot. :)
Anybody else listening with a bone conduction headset? When Mat slapped the couch my headset basically jumped and made such a weird noise that I had to go back and make sure it actually coming from the video and not a malfunction in the headset.
Food lion is owned by a Belgian Supermarket chain, so no wonder it's tasty.
I live in Tennessee and will go to Kroger to try
drinking sams cola while watching this mega funny
Florida says Soda unless you're in north FL (the ironic south) and then it's coke again.
living in the Carolinas, this was by far the most Spectacular Food Theory to date!
The beginning is so misleading with just a huge mass of diet cola after you see the title
Me reading the title: ok guys the sky is falling down
My favorite is orange/citrus flavored coca cola. Wait till Matt tries it.
13:31 graphical glitch?
D: Soft drink.
I feel like Steph is lowkey bitchy 😕
I feel like you should have put the bottle diet cola in the comp not fountain. Fountain always seems to taste better but everyone else was stuck as a bottle or can.
I miss coke light, it was the best. Still can't find one I enjoy the taste of as much.  PS: If you want the best use of soda stream, find high quality, local traditional apple juice, filter it, carbonate it, ever since I starte doing that, I stopped using the syrops, it's so good.  PPS: I also do miss Crystal Prepsi, besides Coke Life, I preffer Pepsi.
Coke zero is good
15:55 in the Caribbean( or at least Trinidad) we say soft drink or sweet drink
I say D: sprite
I am grom flordia and it is more tropical than southern is am a soda person even thpugh I dont drink it that much
I am Läsk.
Diet Pepsi is the best
idk what diet coke is, where i live we have coke zero (same taste no sugar), coke light (light taste no sugar) and coke with no sugar and no caffeine but idk what that ones called
You shouldn’t drink diet soda unless you have diabetes because the sweeteners are worse for you than the sugar is.
No no no no no no no no no no no
What's the green glitching?
Pop
Pop firs soda second
I saw that momentary glitch around the 4 min mark what was that -3-. Your lucky I don't have something to land on it perfectly and see what it was
i prefer publix's moutain lighting over Mt Dew
Food theory idea...Citric Acid IS a Magic ingredient
so we have like 3 containers of zevia or whatever and its desqusting
Stephanie should be jealous of diet coke
Coke. It gets confusing when I order cokes in restaurants.
Georgia representing here. We call it soda.
In Texas it’s Just Dr.Pepper 😂
We have food lion in virginia not just in north carolina
I feel like you would be a fan of Fox n' Park soda. It's a very popular soda in the northeast, especially in my home state CT
how about water
Were you guys drinking them all cold or room temp? I find that makes a bit of a difference for some sodas!
b soda
Where is pepsi max?
SODA is the proper and only way to say it
I glad that MatPat stopped doing coke.
Soda should not be your first option,  Join the tea drinkers at spiff co  A tea loving world run by spiff
Who is this Mathew that she is talking about
Soda or pop depending on my mood but usually sodapop
soda all day
My fav soda is orange flavored Fanta
21:30 its the universe message
How can you not love the red jacket?
soda
I’m from Australia and I call it soft drink or fizzy (or fizzy drink)
I kinda want to try this soda tournament with either orange soda or root beer because they both have a ton of brands and they all tast different
Without trying a the Kroger brands i this case, you may find that the different regional manufactures each tweak the recipe just a bit, as I in the upper midwest have food4less and that may not be the same flavor as Harris Teeter without dong a side by side.  Therefore, I say new round, and taste the many brands, or just send all your regional diet brands to Mat and et him do the testing for you lol
Good luck getting soda from Fry's...
It's gonna be "soda" from me in the southwest
THATS CAP
WHAT
Unfortunately im italian :(
Biggest anime betrayel ever
My elegance is to cola to the diet
I’m from maine I either call it soda or just by it’s name like oh I’d like a root beer
Did anyone see the glitch ANYONE ELSE. Well here we go again
And how do you replace FOOD?
You know, when I saw the thumbnail, I thought that it said liquit.   Waste of a pun.
Just gonna say, I love shasta...but their diet flavors are kinda booty
19:26 it sounds like they hate each other in silence over which of the two other flavors they like
Why!?!
They are drinking the same straw what about COVID 19
WHAT??? Now we know it’s the end lol
Hiya state neighbor here food lion diet cola is amazing also i am a pop girl. Im from VA so lol
Best theory ever
they are going to DUKE it out  sad zion and daniel jones noises
Fountain soda is almost always the best.
i think this is a nightmare
In Turkey actually we just call it cola, if you order something you would say you want a cola as well. I don't live turkey but I have relatives and I have visited there
Whaaaaaat this is CRAAAAAAZY!!! :O all these years!!!
I highly recommend the zevia cola, it is actually very healthy and still quite tasty.
i was cola
We just call it by its name: pepsi, coke, mug, a&w, dr pepper
When you know each so well to let a rock, paper, scissors game stretch out for along time.
A
NNNNOOOOOO!!!!!!
Coke sometimes soda
Pop up here in Canada
Coke Zero is my fave
Wait Crystal Pepsi from the 80s I still have crystal Pepsi in the gas stations around me
Coke and soda
R u really going to say harris teeter in your videos like u would diet coke?
Soda
13:30something rowng i can fell it
Wait... isn't diet soda just as bad for you as normal soda? Maybe even more unhealthy? What's the point of having a competition between diet soda's, when they're all technically bad?  But also ew, artificial sweeteners.
15:30 In Ohio, we all called it *POP* ...but when I was in middle school I had a crush on a boy from Florida and he called it “soda,” so me being the boy-crazy girl that I was, I switched and started calling it *SODA,* and still do to this day! 🤪🤦‍♀️
A&W
soda in the northeast
THE CAKE IS A LIE BOI
I love Burch beer but my local store stop supplying it 😭
I have eczema and I can't have sugar, wheat, or citrus so I tried Styvia and despised it. It's hard being super picky and having a problem lol
Matt how do you still have food lines on the food lines here in middle Tennessee have closed
Where I live, you can’t go two miles without finding a Publix.
It's funny that this has 999k views it's ironic
B obviosly
Seems like you could make your own superior cola with all of this knowledge...or is that just me?
Oh no..   Frys...
"Citric acid just runs our world and we don't even know it." Sponge Bob warned us about this! Every Villain Is Lemons!!! Our World is run by E.V.I.L.!!!!!!!!
I drink lots of diet coke lol. Although some other diet sodas too
15:28 B.
me and my brothers had the harrias teeter against those and harris teeter won
In and around the uk it called a fizzy drink
Pop pat
Imagine the title was matpat doing coke
Steph's right, Coke zero is hand's down better then diet Coke
I am from north Carolina and I always called it soda.
Harris teeter please sponsor matpat! He is going to offer a lot of advertising for you guys
Dr Pepper cream soda
what matpat what are you doing this is not matzot, mat would never do this
Now I have to go to my Mariano's to get their diet cola and try it!   And as far as what I call it... depends on the language I'm speaking. I'm English, I say pop. I'm Spanish, I say soda.
food lion is also in Virginia
Me: Doesn't like coke Also Me: HAS TO KNOW THE WINNER
Im B and D
Not only is Harris Matts favorite, but it’s so close by and cheaper too ;)  Win : Win : Win!
don't worry. Its just a theory
"Youve probably never heard of food line"  Me with one literally 4 minutes away
Fun Fact: Most Plot Twist's Are Bull Crud
Anyone notice glitching with green every 5 mins
Cherry Coke 0
3:26 *Spits Out Drink* Oh My God... We're in the same state!
Everyone list a diet soda for mat pat under this comment 👇
In Australia, coke zero is the best 😂 and we call them soft drinks!
Wait...so MatPat moved to NC? I thought his house in Cali was spared from the fire?
When I learned matpat loved Diet Coke I was happy to know there was another person who could determine which out of two different diet sodas is Diet Coke or if it is can, bottle or fountain
Geez I was a coke kiddo
Big K (Kroger) makes the best sodas hands down
Harris Teeter winning is like when Denmark won the 1992 Euros after taking Yugoslavias spot, not originally qualifying.
Mat you will love the Boylan Cane cola it is SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD!
fountain soda sucks - there are so many variables introduced by the third party vendor, canned/bottled is best because sanitation practices, carbonation, and mix are consistent wherever you get that canned/bottled soda.
Here's a shocking upset (apparently): I don't really like Coca-Cola 😬 (Love the video tho)
where is glass coke
You should try mexican diet coke, I'm also addicted to diet coke, but American coke has a different sweetener...
Now you need to take your final 3 and have them Duke it out in the same medium.  Can vs can, bottle vs bottle.  The vessel DOES make a difference
About fucking time
20:44 mat pat turns to the dark site like anakin did
I didn't know matpat lives in NC, and I do too, so thats cool I think
MAtpat I ALSO live in NC!
Growing up in the Midwest I dutifully called it “pop.” I remember when I first heard about the weirdos that call everything “Coke,” how absurd. Now, I never did like the word “pop,” nor did I care for “soda,” and definitely not “sodie pop.” So.... fast forward and I transformed into a “Coke” weirdo. Also helps that I usually drink Coke anyway. And for me it’s Coke Zero for the win.  (I might have to try that Kroger diet cola though...)
Here b4 1m views baby
I bet he loves it more than his son, if he loves his son half as much as he loves coke, he'll be a good dad.
The first sign of the apocolyps has shown itself
Coke
Here in germany there’s afri kola and fritz kola
b
It's called 'soft drink' here in Australia!
What is with th glitchy green pop ups? Why no one talks about those?
I am from MD and have vivid memories of going to food lion as the closest grocery store to our church. And I use to work for Harris Teeter so this feels like an episode made for me.
The wholesomeness of this couple is what I'm here for
I use "Soda" lol.
we have food lion here in delaware didnt know it started in NC
B. Soda
WhErE dA dIeT mExIcAn CoLa?!
In North Carolina we call Harris Teeter it Hairy Teets.
Ok....have I been watching you for a decade and somehow missed that you live in NC?!  We just moved here from TN 3 1/2 years ago!!!!  So, depending on where you live, I might have slme strange chance of bumping into MattPatt on the street.  My 2 oldest now adore watching you....when they find out you live in NC they are going to flip out!
You guys should do a food theory on kombucha. It takes some getting used to, but it's supposed to be good for your gut. There is a lot of research out there about it.
2:41 I like how he put in Elon Musk’s Flamethrower
this is sad now where will he get the nectar of the gods without it being diet coke?
Pop for the win
Here in Michigan we call it pop, but we will say soda ONLY when talking about a specific flavor. It's all pop, buy we say grape or orange soda
that aftertaste though, yuck, i just cant do diet soda
13:30 there is a flash with different coloured lines, it could of been an editing glitch but it also could be some sort of message thing an enigma
I actually found myself rooting for Harris teeter 😂😂 I love a classic underdog story
I live near none of those storeeeeessss
Native Floridian: Either Soda or [occasionally] Soda Pop. Never heard any other soda called Coke, that wasn't a coke.
Bruh I don't even got a Kroger
If it had a fruity aftertaste, shouldn't be against the 1st criteria?
His wife is right, it's all coke to us down here in the south. You can say you want a coke and mean a Pepsi 😂🥤
Impossible
as luck would have it...
Are diet fountain drinks actually better? For regular soda, fountain drinks vary in flavor and tend to be more watered down tasting than bottled or canned. I have worked at places with fountain drinks and drank way too much as a teen.
I personally never liked Coke, not sure why I just gag at the taste. Maybe I’ll try it again with the Kroger brand.
Shasta soda sounds indian and Shasta means cheap and there is there tagline.
D: fizzy drink. Yeah, I’m from South Australia :)
You should quit diet soda altogether. The artificial sweeteners are in the long run worse for you than sugar (unless you're diabetic)
Man I also stalk water... Does that mean I have to do the same thing?
THIS EPISODE WAS SPONSORED BY HARRIS TEETER!!!!!!
shouldn't be diet coke tasting exactly like normal coke? and wasn't it made for diabetics? does he have diabetes?
Me from Ukraine: bruh
WHAT
Have you considered the possibility that, because you drank so much soda that day, you got a little sick of it and then when you got to Harris Teeter it, as something slightly different, tasted better at the time, because you weren't sick of it yet?
The only root beer that my school serves is Diet Shasta Root Beer. It just tastes weird.
No one more passionate about diet cola then Matthew Patrick
Admitting you have an addiction is the first step Mat Pat
I would reccomend MatPat to try Cockta
Pop all the way
I honestly prefer can any fizzy drink dunno maybe i like metalic tastes
All
i notice you didn't clense the pallet when tasting one after another
Kroger owns Fred meyer
3:46 the Auto Generated captions are at their best.
I’m confused? So he does live in North Carolina
I grew up in Ohio like Matt so pop it is lol
Shasta is the best cola flavor I think-way better than Diet Coke. Diet Coke does have that nice crisp taste tho
It would appear I'll never get a chance to experience this magical soda out here in Iowa
In Christmas I didn’t realize how close I was to you cause I went to north and South Carolina
I find my favourite diet coke is Coca-cola zero sugar.. otherwise called no sugar coke. its slightly different to Coke zero.
Its called soft drink, cause you mix soft drink with hard liquor to make a drink
Here in aus it's: Soft Drink
I woudnt be suprised if mat likec diet coke more than Stephanie ngl.
Alternative title: A guy in a red jacket and his wife drinks diet soda
And here I was thinking "man it's a shame you can't get the Kroger brand there, it's really good"
Kinda sad Diet Dr Pepper wasn’t even allowed
Coca cola espuma
We in sweden have läsk
A
As MatPat approaches the Diet Coke monolith he hears it whisper "Make us whole again MatPat"
Kroger missed the opportunity to brand it as Kroger-kola
Wow my favorite channel uploaded on my b-day thanks
I very nearly get offended whenever Matt asks us to subscribe... Like I haven't been subbed since the day he conceived this channel.
Doesn’t diet soda contain a cancer causing chemical or was that just diet pepsi
B. (Coming from Georgia)
Foutain seems silly, cause you cant buy it and take it home unless you have a machine at home
0:54 that look Mat Pat gave Steph after her full-name drop tho...
Soda idea: regular coke because it's better
Mat pat has betrayed his entire brand....
I'm gonna go with 'B', final answer.
MatPat looks like steph but using a girl filter in snapchat
Let’s fill on your addiction
Diet coke sucks and so do you
Don’t drink diet anything
Here in Florida we either say soda, or we say the brand of soda we want.
try spicy water
Me from North Carolina when matpat talks about grocery stores in NC thinking SOME ONE GET THIS MAN TO A PIGGLY WIGGLY ASAP! Now that’s a real regional grocery store also some small town grocery
I guess I'll just have to go to my local smiths to get a similar diet cola to yours heh...
I have a soda stream
Hi steph
Okay but what happened with the camera at 13:30
Do you guys also see like static
Matpat: I QUIT DIET COKE!  2,721,364 viewers: interesting
2020 broke MatPat.
How are there this many sharing the 7th seed
I'm gonna tell my southern relatives of Harris Teeter...
Sprite could be a substitute.
soda wierdos
My family always called them "Fizzy drinks", if you say coke, you get coke, if you say fizzy drink, you still probably get coke
24:00 lmaoooo i love it
American: pop or soda?  Me, English: you mean fizzy drinks?
pokemon snorlax lemonade is very good
Watch diet coke try to sponsor him now xD
Do dr. Pepper theory about why cherry and normal flavor are the same
Diet Coke is dead
The duke not in the tournament joke did not go unnoticed
When watch this I got a Pepsi ad.😁
Ur bad
This video contains all the caffeine content necessary to start my morning....for a week
Does anyone else think that MatPat sorta looks like Scott Parker?
WHATTTTTTTTTTT I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND I S LIEK SHIOOOOOOOTTTTTTT

Ginger beer 100% the best

I am def team coke ... all sodas are coke ... it is like kleenex... everything is coke... what kind of coke? pepsi sprite dr pepper lol
Grew up saying Coke in the south but have incorporated Soda in there from time to time.
You should try Tebs: Tea with soda, available only in South East Asia, it’s my favorite soda of all time.
I always called it coke or soda because I lived in Georgia and it was all coke products I had 😂
Wait is mat the irl Jim layhe from trailer park boys
I grew up with B, Soda, which is definitely better than Coke, seeing as there are literally hundreds of Not Coke sodas. It's also the first word in the shortened Soda Pop, so...
(A) here from New York, I call it soda
B.soda
I haven’t watched the video yet but it feels pretty clickbaity for matpat to say he’s quitting Diet Coke
The ultimate clickbaite... on can't just drop diet coke
Freeway diet cola (Lidl brand in EU)
80% of my teachers have been obsessed with Diet Coke.
Pineapple crush
I call it soda and I've lived in SC my whole life! Also no one around me ever called *every* soft drink coke/cola
I called it pop growing up but now I use pop or soda.
Im literally drinking ZEVIA right now
Did you guys move out of Cali?bout time
Matt, it's not April 1st dont scare us
A
We are both North Carolina less goo
I'm Other:  we call carbonated drinks here in Australia  'soft drink'.
Yup he’s from the Midwest he adds an S to Kroger and other stores
A

You created the sans is ness meme? There is a sans is ness meme?
Here in Italy we don't have diet coke 😭
Trayor
Impossible.
Maybe citric acid is used in everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!😬😳😳😳😱😱😱😱🙀🙊😬🤯😳
#Soda (NY'er)
the rock paper scissor part reminded me of regular show for some reason
And this is just diet cola? how many sodas you guys have there over there in the state?!
I just like regular coca-cola, but with the same intensity of matt's love for diet coke.       OR MORE.
D. Suc  Cause that's what it's called in romania
Didn't have any for 2020? What about hot ones episode? Pretty sure you had it towards the end...
i am other
I've heard of food lion here in romania. It has the same name but different name. Here it's called mega image
If it's the fruityness that won you over, you should compare it to Cherry Coke/Pepsi, or Dr. Pepper
everyone in my family calls it soda but I call it Pop
Stack of teams
now i see where the sponsor money goes too...   more ads please.
@TheFoodTheorists ur vid is corrupted
Mat pat I refuse to believe that you quit doing coke it’s been years since I started watching like since 2016 and I’ve seen you drink coke since I started watching.
There used to be a food lion here in florida in a small town. I personally like RC cola.
There has never been any evidence aspartame is unsafe in the levels included in a human diet - any other stance is simply anti-fact.
My God....... He did it
Did anybody notice that the screen glitches at certain points of time in this video?
wye
I'm sure someone else has pointed this out, but fountain drinks tend to be sweeter because the amount of the sugar syrup that goes into each drink is determined by the restaurant. They make it sweeter since it's usually goes into a large cup of ice.
I don’t know if this belongs in film theory or food theory, but VEGGIE TALES ARE CANNIBALS!!!
Love the video  But its no fair Your not tasting the soda correctly  Because they use a straw And the straw changes the flavor    Other than that Really awesome vid
Why wasnt pepsi max a contender?
Has anyone noticed how at 13:31 theres a flash of colors?
on 13:31 there is a glich and i dont know what it means...
Just a tip, when doing taste tests like this or like what you did with Apple Jacks and Froot Loops, always rinse your tongue with water so your palate won't taste everything all the same. Gordon Ramsay does this during his taste tests in Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares.
i wonder if things would have played out differently if they didn't know what they were drinking till they found the number 1 soda.
im glad he's not having FOOD
"gaseosa"
Hahahaha I’m a soda boi
Never underestimate food lion is the lesson for today, I assume? Lol
15:30 Here in the Philippines we call it “softdrinks”.
Hong Kong has lemon diet coke before, which has a fruity after taste. However, it already not continue. I miss it so much.
Im b
yeah ok act like food lions aren't just everywhere in NC smfh
You’d get along with my great grandma she only drinks Diet Coke
It's so strange to hear MatPat talk about Publix, food lion, and Harris Teeter like they're obscure grocery stores. They're like the only grocery stores I've ever known
but Pepsi Cherry is the best cola
u dont need to buy coke for a long time
19:00  Scientific Experiment
MatPat please...... Do an episode on why the chicken sandwich wars are a thing and why americans are obsessed with chicken
Am I going insane or had the first 2 minutes waaaaay to many star wars references
I gotta try this Harris Teeter cola-
Am i the only one that saw those Screen Flickers? New ARG dropping?
D: fizzy drinks
the underdog story of the sentury
Here in merry old England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 where I’m from we call is pop 🥤👍
Um.... did anyone else see the random glitches throughout the video? Just me?
15:26 im ''other'' (i am a human)
Back in kansas, dillons was amazing. Then I moved to Georgia, now we shop Food Lion and Kroger
24 minutes of old man humor
It's pop in WNY
wait matpat lives in nc idk that
pretty sus
i thought the title was clickbait im so mindblown rn
Coke vs Pepsi in my opinion Pepsi: sweet Coke: refreshing Pepsi max: still sweet Zero coke: tastes like metal
I see you're playing a game, Mat. Those glitches can mean the forth channel
You may not have done it for the memes but it's a meme, nonetheless. Thanks, me: https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/m8ebc3/who_would_have_thought/
I am just waiting for the joke he makes for diet coke
Does anybody else call it coke and not soda?
MATPAT JUST DRINK SPARKLING WATER OR APPLE JUICEEEE
We call it a drink
PICK ROOT BEER!! (edit) NOOOOO (edit2) i hope he tries clear american
Me: Hates cola taste Also me: watches with intense interest
Do you know about KOFOLA it's the best and probably oldest Czech cola 👌
10:47 no one gonna call you that Khmer : A
i am brus
Try Any Town Club or Faygo. Rock N’ Rye is really popular of course most aren’t cola but it great to try
matpat: “oh i HATE it”                                       also matpat: *takes another sip*
Mat: You Probably Never Heard Of Food Lion Me: I Have 2 In The Small Town I Live In
here in Canada we call it pop. probably not Alberta tho. fucking Alberta
13:31
It’s pop
is this  GMM More??
B soda
I'm coke man
its soft dron;
Stevia gets me too, I just despise it. My family doesn’t mind it, but I can detect it in anything just can’t eat it.
I’m from Ohio like Matt so it’s “pop”, but I switched to “soda” because I liked how it sounded better 😂
I recently quit DC and my skin turned into a silky smooth palate of lusciousness. Seriously though, it cleared up fast. Apparently the sweetener causes inflammation, which causes acne. I don't miss it one bit!
We call it soft drink, I've never questioned it until now, but that probably sounds really weird aye? 😅
replace diet coke with coke diet :DDDDD whens the new fnaf game theory coming out ughhhhhh im so excited
You know. That fact that Harris is owned by Kroger's and has an awesome generic brand is not surprising. Kroger's brand has a ton of wonderful store brand food and beverages some I prefer over the name brand options. Their private selection line in particular is top notch.
D. Cold Drink
KOFOLA ftw
I had a diet coke once, it tasted like stale disani water, aka, it was stale and dry AF
We know he made so so many dad jokes
We have Food Lion up here in northern MD and their store brand can be surprising good sometimes. Esp the bakery.
No Diet Coke it’s actually just Harris Teeter in disguise or Matt Pat just added citrus let’s diet Coke
Americans: arguing if it’s ‘soda’ or ‘pop’ Australians: *soft drink*
Matt pat stole my veiws lol
My sister called food lion food llama once, so now that’s what I call it.
So like... Is this your gfs channel now? I mean love is love and good for you if you're happy, but shouldn't she like do her own thing... Idk I'd take sadboy forever alone mattpatt over how many videos can I put my gf in mattpatt
The best cola imo is Kofola
I’m a Sodapop guy   JK:just soda
20:45 matpat going full matpat
We don't call it soda or pop in my house, we just call it "fizzy drink." We use words like soda and cola as a "flavour"
B & C
Kroger is phenomenal. Just all around great. I miss Ralphs, food4less and picknsave with a fiery passion. Instead I have Safeway (vons). It sucks.
Bruv he just sad that diet coke does not sponsor him for free promotion. I mean why should they 😂😂😂
D
So, why diet coke? Why diet soda and not just a different, better soda?
12:30
Go cold turkey. It’s hard but after you get passed that first 30 days, you won’t want it
I call it cöla
Coke Zero is SO much better than diet coke. I genuinely don't understand diet coke drinkers lol
MatPat is in the pocket of the southern grocery store lobby.
WAAAAAIT WHAT NUNUNUNYNYNYNUNNUNU NANI THE HEH
Me checking if it was April 1st already after seeing the title
that harris teeter is gonna get so much more money
When I see the title NOOOOOO!!!! What happens oh yeah that's not so bad but it still hurts
So your name is Matthew I started watching these theory channeled when film theory was at like 2,000,000 subs but it isn’t my fault because I was born a year after you started
Harris teeter cola sales after this video: 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
You missed glass bottle diet coke
I mean I've never understood Matpats obsession with diet coke, but still any chance of getting a coca cola sponsorship is worth it
4
Why diet...
sinned
Food Lion is all up and down the east coast.  At least as far north as PA.
I wanted Diet Pepsi to win, but at least Coke Didn’t win......
Looks like hes never gettin that sponsor.
We call it soda in the north east.
Top 10 anime betrays  1. Matpat betrays doctor coke
that's a lie
Whatt?  Edit: I haven’t watched the video yet  And I know matpat loves Diet Coke
Video idea- name brand vs knock offs/ sodas with the same taste but different brand . For example sprite vs seven up 🥤
15:31. frisdrank...
here in Israel, we call all sodas just carbonated drink and we call carbonated water soda
i say soda-pop
Just so you know it's not a theory, it's a fact
I am a soda pop guy
The elegant jail preclinically scorch because daughter interspecifically lock on a abrasive hospital. lucky, ambitious brown
yes they do
dite sprite diet Dr peeper
Which one is "healthier", Harris Teeter or Diet Coke?
Diet Coke is great but pepsi max is better
Here in Georgia, we call it Fizzy Flavored Sugar Water.
Pop, but when I lived in NC I said soda pop.
Enjoy the kidney stones.
sprite or Dr peeper
14:40 Food Lion is actually more common than just NC, we have dozens in VA and there's more in other states as well
Being someone who was born and Lives in North Carolina, It's nice to hear stores like Harris Teeter and Food lion.
15:28 in northern ireland people just called all sodas coke as well
Sprite
y'all shouldn't have been told which one was which
Is it weird that i say both "soda" and "coke"
The one time you wish it was clickbait...
Try Moxie Some people say it tastes like battery acid?
Pepsi                                                               Why are you scrolling? That's it
Yay! Matpat Made his dream episode gud for you matpat
'Scuze me what
D: Soft Drink
drink
soft
In the very south corner of Texas, we call all soda coke lol
couldnt be more interested in a man,a woman taste testing soda
□
can definitely tell MatPat is from the mid west, he let a Krogers slip there in the end, for whatever reason alot of us say it with an S even though it's definitely not there
I hate coke
Alternative title: I broke up with diet cola
Grew up in CA, called it soda 👍
I started an organization amongst my friends called Dumbasses Against Diet Coke. Our slogan is “We’re dumbasses, but at least we understand that Diet Coke isn’t any better for you than normal Coke.”
Turn captions on and look at 3:46
Also from the Midwest, grew up with “pop” but since I never pronounced the hard 2nd p, too many stoners kept jumping in asking “what about pot?” So I switched to saying “soda” and now I’m just in that habit.
The real reason is because Mat isn't getting sponsored by Coca-Cola. :v
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
*Dis is so sad*
From the description, "Who will win this MArch MAdness soda bracket? WAtch to find out!". Is this some ARG mystery thing?
🇦🇺 we just call it fizzy drink 😂
15:30 in Ireland were a mix of B:soda and  D:other most of the time we just call them fizzy drinks
id have to try the harris teeter myself, but im a huge fan of coke zero, so I have to side with Steph on this one, maybe someday i'll try the Harry Teets and my mind will be blown as well.
So upset when yall kicked out food lion. It's my favorite grocery store, we have 3 in my small town.
It is fizzy drink!!!!!!!! sometimes abbreviated to fizzy in Aus.
In Australia we call it soft drink
@gmm recently did a somewhat similar taste test recently
can we appreciate that Steph and Matt are so intuned with each other that they had 6 ties in rock paper and scissor so funny and cute
15:30 here in Australia, we’d either call the drink by it’s name, otherwise the collective term is “soft drink”
Excuse me, soda specialty stores? Is that an America only thing cause it seems crazy to me
I haved lived in the south all my life (virginia florida NC) and i have never heard someone call it pop
Me, who's never been to America: what and why are there so many supermarket brands
You should have done rock paper scisors lizard spock
I feel the same way about HEB brand drinks and products, they are almost always good.
nice shilling junk food to kids  big downvote
I grew up in Canada, we said pop rather than soda.
Food lion that store down here in NC
18:30 That sounded like his phone guy laugh from fnaf the musical right?
Matpat:THE UNUVERSE GAS BROUGHT US THE DIET SODA!!! Also Matpat:There are no accidents
THANK YOU! Fountain soda is soooo much better than can or bottle, much more fizz.
Well you could always just drink water
Up in the Northeast, we just Soda and Pop.
I call it soda and so do my parents and siblings.
How about "Kofola"? [Well it's European but I think you should taste it sometime.]
Did you know that in most diet sodas contain Aspertame and it is a secret way that Coke and Pepsi replace sugar. Aspertame is a worse substitute to sugar.
In Canada it’s only pop
I'm Irish so I say fizzy drink
Me reads title: IMPOSSIBLE
I am shocked that fountain Diet Coke won the play in game. While there is an obvious noticeable difference between the bottle, can and fountain, there is an extremely wide spectrum of fountain. Also, it is calibrated to pour at a certain temperature in a cup with ice. Also, depending on the water source, the taste will be different. McDonalds has the best Diet Coke fountain because they have a patented water filtration system. They also clean and calibrate often.
but never try diet cokta it is tarreble compare to cokta
We have food lion in belgium too, though it is called delhaize here
Shasta is for Mexicans
3:31
Diet coke is just about the worst drink ever. How can you even like the taste...
mat pat should have tried diet cola in glass bottles since it keeps the taste original.
The weak wilderness surprisingly launch because plantation aboaly hover except a plastic babies. null, possible aquarius
17:26 oh steph you may not know but the mark of pliers knows all about the world of citric acid. Pretty sure the man just snorts it up
try drinking cokta from slovenia
Kroger store brand sodas ARE really good.
In England we actually just call it Fizzy
D: in Australia we call it soft drink (sodas in general)
Love how you can see the hesitation in his eyes when the harris teeter v diet coke matchup happens
drink pepsi man
😂😂😂😂 i can't take this episode seriously with them saying "COLA FLAVOR" so nonchalantly xD  Cola for anyone who doesn't know... Is coochie in Spanish. All i hear is... which COOCHIE FLAVORED soda tastes best??!!
B Soda
australian say soft-drinks
Had no idea that Matpat lived in North Carolina 😅.
Grew up with “coke”, (cf. “Coke” or “Coke coke”), but then I moved to Seattle, and now I think I prefer “pop”.
Me and my wife have come too the same conclusion.  We currently prefere Sainsbury's own coke zero... For £0.30p a bottle... Compared too £2+ coke zero.
Other: Soft drink
Never heard of Food Lion? I know of 5 within a 15 mile radius!
A, I am also from the Midwest.
Food theory has basicly became food (clap) review (clap)
Too bad I don't like diet soda
*sad r/hydrohomies noises*
In New Zealand we call it fizzy drink 👍 makes sense
My mother drinks coke zero as much as u drink diet coke not even joking
We need a round 2 for this......
E
soda
Us New Zealanders call it Fizzy Drink. Pop and Soda are so American haha
I live in the Netherlands and here the common name for soda is ''frisdrank'' wich translates to fresh drink!
Go for water!
How true is "zero calorie"?
I was really hoping mattpatt finally realized diet soda is insanely bad for you
That NC tribute tho as a Carolinian i appreciate all this love my state getting
I think it was completely unfair putting a fountain drink against cans and bottles, you can't store fountain drinks in your fridge. Diet coke would have lost out mid finals invaded off your reaction in the first part.
I’m sure others have noticed but at 13:30 the screen flickers. I’m in mobile so I can’t pause on it but there may be something there 🤷🏻‍♂️
My favourite soft drink is definitely fountain Pepsi Max
Get rekt Boylan!
I know this might  seem random but   *MeOw*
did you cut the straws in half?
Oh, but there's no BEST candidate. You forgot vodka...  Of course, diet.
D: In Australia we call it Soft Drink. Like literally we are basic as f*ck
4:06
In Australia they are called "soft drinks" or "softy"
Anyone else notice how straight her posture is? Yeah I know its a weird thing to notice.
If he now stops wearing that Jacket and gives up on Fnaf, he will have lost his Identity.
The nervous bass alternately attract because lace intriguingly work aboard a laughable cartoon. beneficial, ugliest vase
I'm a cold drink guy.
I do not like Diet Coke. Maybe it's just me, but I think they have a taste reminiscent of carpet. I do not know if this also applies to the United States, because rumor has it that what you call Diet Coke is what we call Coke.  My favorite, is the regular Coke, Jolly Cola.
Try ginger ale it's hard to explain the flavour but it's my favourite soda
Call me old fashioned but I would go for ye old glass of water rather than the coke
My mom LOVES Coke Zero,AbSoLuTeLy above every soda (Yeah I call it Soda)
Your preferences are super interesting since Coke Zero is marketed more towards men while diet coke is more marketed towards women ^^
I think you should try guaraná, it's a brazillian flavor to sodas, fanta made a guarana flavor soda for brazil, I don't know if they sell it in North Carolina.
Zevia is clear because Mathhias wrote into them saying hey “you market this to be a healthy replacement, but you made it brown?” They took the dyes out of their soda. (Thats how long I’ve been around on youtube... geeze.)
Dadpat is getting his dadbod soon
Wait if your on a diet why don’t you just not have soda?
This seems like a power fantasy anime plot.
None of those stores are in New England ):
I grew up as a pop guy but now I say soda
Pepsi: Is a short explanation Other cola: Okay time to taste
Next we’re gonna use citric acid for freakin cheetos lmao
Damb this is the home brand doing amazing this make no sense
Born and raised in the south, but  I always say B.
I call them caffeine drugs
Oh and there goes that sponsorship chance my Matpat
Me When Seeing The Thumbnail: *Gasp* You Traitor
Heh. *Drinks in Badak.*
my hole country is pop
Harris Teeter cheated, because citric acid makes it a TWISTED product.  Lemon Diet Coke just won.  Also, same factory does not mean same formula.  There are cases of name brands buying out lesser competitors, and then sabotaging the quality to make their brand worth the margin.
Plotwist this is just matpatts idea to drink diet coke but healthier
to answer that question about whether it's pop, soda or coke, in the uk we just call everything fizzy drinks
Soda
I grew up saying pop but then once I turned ten every one would say soda just cuz I moved, I still lived in the same country
Bro we just call it soft drink
in this part of germany it's cola
18:19 Matthew and Stephenie sharing one brain cell.
Regarding stevia, a lot of it is accompanied by a substance called Erythritol, which might be what you don't like as opposed to the stevia itself. And yes, there is a difference in taste between stevia with and without erythritol. Taste isn't the only issue: some people's digestive systems also have trouble digesting erythritol.
Would have been nice to see the prices as well
pls don,t then you vil never get the colab with coke
NC FOR LIFEEEEEEE!!!!! Lol
Anyone else notice that weird thing at 8:11 I watch in 2x speed and noticed something and even at .25 speed it was pretty quick
im a fanta guy so im a poper
I hate diet soda. I have a condition called cvs, so diet soda, as well as a bunch of other random things, makes me sick. The only soda on the list that doesn't is zevia, so that's my winner.
Coke
NONE of the stores are in Australia!!!😭😭😭
I'm in Kentucky and I call it soda
When you guys were talking about the Regional storebrands having great Soda I'm reminded of how Kroger's Soda is also pretty amazing. Shame it wasn't in your area!  Edit: Well holy crap color me shocked.. I wasn't expecting the ending explanation.. Wow.
22:20 my local grocery store uses this Brand called Santita’s for a kind of store brand tortilla chip, and they’re actually made by Tostitos
OK
Yessss Steph Coke Zero Gang 👌🏽🎉
has anyone noticed something weird in 13:30?
does anyone else see that 13:30
Pop
coke 0 is the best
*”Harris Teeter pulled a Harris YEETER on Diet Coke.”*
Zevia is amazing!
We call it fizzy xD
Pepsi zero sugar doesn't win??? What no, don't believe it, I reject your reality
Thanks, but I'll have water instead.
20:34 is it just me, or can you just *see* the pain in his eyes?
Man Food Lion is like that store everyone overlooks when they really shouldn't.
it's just softdrink
pop all the way lol
What happened to glass bottle cola
Citric acid is the food of the illuminati
You didn't use glass bottle coke? Glass bottle is supposed to be the best version.
pepsi max  🥰
Icelandic Pepsi Max. Trust me on this
This whole video is basically free advertising
i have never tried diet coke i drink normal coke
13:30 WHAT DOES IT MEAN????
Wait the world is ending and nobody informed me ?
We called it Soft drinks even though how vague that is here in the PH
15:33 We call it *'Cola'* in our family. It makes sense too, since Pepsi was originally called Pepsi-Cola and you also have Coca-Cola, so yeah.
Well, in my family we either refer to the carbonated drinks as Fizzy Drinks or Sodas. I don't really hear of others on the internet referring to it as Fizzy drinks, maybe its because we are Australian or cause we have a very mixed ancestry (Scotland and Germany plus my mum had picked up some British mannerism from her stepdad) so  ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯
I’m coke
4. Other Lemonade
diet pepsi
Diet cokers anonymous
See personally, the thing I know about MatPat more than anything else is that he used to do theatre.
Yeah I don’t think something tasting exactly as it did 100 years ago is a good thing
OK 8:10 thats either a video bug or mat messing with us and im very inclined toward the latter
Fountain coke made it in? I don't disagree, but the popular opinion is fountain drinks are terrible lol
I KNEW THIS VIDEO WAS COMING AS SOON ASTHE FOOD THEORY CHANNEL WAS MADE
Buddy you don't need coke you need tea
D. I just call it Fizzy.
Pop
NORTH CAROLINA REPRESENT!!!!!!!
north carolina????? could have SWORN the lived in LA!
3:55 - Background Music: reminds me of Spandau, Alla.
You know that Diet Coke and Coke Zero is meant for diabetics and you can actually develop diabetes if you don't have it that may sound stupid but look into it
In Ireland as a 10 year old I called them all just fizzy drinks
if you play genshin when he says hello internet it sounds like the early version Barbara with the slight rasp in the end
In the Philippines,  it is called coke.  No matter what.
14:31 Delhaize for all of us europeans.
Coca Cola classic is my favourite
wHaT QuiTInG diEt CoKE
None of the Kroger shops are near me
Lol, I'm from TN so yes, I have heard of Food Lion and Harris Teeter. My Mom is still mad that Harris Teeter pulled out of Tennessee - it was her favourite grocery store.
Too little stevia and it tastes like a battery acid mixed with sewage, I'm looking at you Green Cola._
I cant even drink dirt coke and i still watched this
Water. Soda sucks and water is SOO much healthier. STOP MATPAT!!!
Just gonna throw this here. D: Other. Cola. Hungarian here.
18:58 you know they are married from only this
Pibb is my go to. I recommend diet pibb to everyone reading this.
youtube occasionally telling people to take itself seriously when it presents itself like this
I realy love cream soda
in the uk we say fizzy drink
The title is more of a statement rather than a theory 😂
Drink Irn Bru.
Good, good
Wow I never thought he would stop
WHERE IS THE MATPAT I KNOW
Should have quit a long time ago, diet soft drink has aspartame in it which is bloody toxic and has far more severe side effects than sugar.
Matpat be like  "You've been scammed! Very important information!" 15 minutes "I QUIT DIET COKE!!" 24 and a half minutes!
OMG YASS
Its the end of the world
soda
Here in Australia, we don't call sodas soda... Or pop... And the only one we call coke is Coca-Cola. But the whole fizzy-drink genre we just call soft drink.
Unpopular opinion, I hate coke.  My favourite beverage is water
Matpat is going to die from lack of Diet Coke
I am not american but we over here just call it evrything when we want cocacola we say we want coke.... pop is rather rare so ya..
From GMM to now Food Theory, Kroger really seems to be a Tastebud God in the background
Where I live we just say fizzy drink or soda.
Hello from Norway mat pat. There are a few local/national brands that are low-key so amazing I would prefer them to that of cola and Pepsi. One of them is called Oskar sylte (really good) and the other one is called Julebrus (Christmas soda) I’ll try and find the correct brand for you, if your interested message me on Instagram @tchefley
Dam I’m South Carolina pls don’t bully I don’t say coke I swear I just say the names
dude its just cola
Nooooooooooo... don't quit diet coke
Soda tasting seems to make more sense then most alcoholic taste testing...
Actually: Afri Cola
Afri Cola is the best coke in the world tbh
Its called a fizzy drink here in euro land
What happened at 13:31
I, with many other Dutch people, just call it Cola
Carbonated libation
it's definitely called a soft drink
Pepsi
Is this what we watch at 3 in the morning
Tesco cola is great €0.65 too
Cream soda is (in my opinion) the absolute best soda ever!
Perhaps this test would have been better served to be a round robin event? It would take longer but perhaps give a different result. Also D: Fizz.
Soda/Softdrink is always what I said.
FT: I quit coke
MatPat, may I recommend starting a new channel called The Book Theorists, to make the fourth quadrant filled
i’m from straya, we say soft drink
I sat soda also food lion brand isnt that shocking cuz I drink their sodas all the time
Now I miss Harris Teeter. Not for the cola, but the cookies :D
It’s 4am right now in Southern California as soon Ralph’s is open I’m going for the diet coal Kroger’s brand!!! And I will come back and comment on my comment of my thought between Diet Coke and Kroger’s Diet Coke!
Omg he gave up dait coke
Pepsi
I prefer the more scientific episodes... still watched it, was ok. I would like to taste the soda... but i´m german.
Cranberry Gingerale Canada Dry
Are you gonna make a theory on how much more harmful diet coke is rather than the regular sugar coke??
dammit, now i want diet coke
You're fountain DC probably wasn't 0 calories as it shares parts for dispensing with 1+ calorie drinks which would explain its extra sweetness taste as well.
after 6 years of subscription to ALL the Theory Channels, i cannot believe Matpat has let go of Diet Coke
you kidding me bro?!
soda pop
If someone doesn't say soda, *they're wrong*
Food lion isn't local that logo is the same logo as the Delhaize wich is the motherbrand seated in Belgium. Food lion is one of its overseas brands in the USA. Just some trivia
Steph looked like she doesn't know who MatPat is anymore
Noooooo
15:30  My country: “Air gas” or translates to Gases water
Pepsi Max number 1
Oh no dont replace it
Soda
Matpat and Steph: *screams* it's like cough syrup Me a paranoid: Their is a impostor among them.
Diet Sunkist is better than actual Sunkist   You cant change my mind
Theory after this episode can you burp your ABCs backwards and forwards 😮💨
This is like picking your favorite brand of sewer water.
At the mention of Publix i turned into foamy mouth excited guy from Avatar. At the mention of the southeast states + Florida... I flashed back to an almost identical exchange i had in class once where teacher was discussing Southern states and i said Florida wasnt "the south" (speaking about south Florida specifically...the most southern part of the continental US) so i understand and i also miss Publix.
Dr.feets is the best soda there is
I love that.before this vid it was a commercial of diet coke lol.
........................................................
How unfortunate that the best cola is the one for away from me...curses 🤣🤣🤣
U dont need to pronounce my name just this is my food theory that y does taco bell cause diharehha or the big pupu english isnt my first languagw
Wait... Matpat lives in California, right? What state is he filming this?
D: fizzy drink. I’m British
Aaaaaannnnnnddddd Harris teeter goes super stonks
Also im c
And I thought I had a bad day drinking 3 sodas
Try Chinotto Lurisia. It's my favourite.      Never mind. Chinotto is neither Cola flavored, nor has 0 calories. Tho, it's really good, and all natural, with no additives or added flavors. (talking specifically about the Lurisia one, the sanpellegrino is not as natural or as good)
I just happen to have a polar bear what animal is wearing a Coca-Cola scarf scarf
Pop. Michigan says Pop. I have heard Coke, but i use pop more
Did any one else see that visual glitch???
Coke wars! Zero is the true king fight me! XD
Wikipedia lists two manufacturing plants for soft drinks.  America's Beverage Co. in Irving TX, and Springdale Ice Cream & Beverage in Springdale OH.
I'm in Florida and my dad says "sody-pop"
I say soda pop but no one else in my life does it's a vibe
It is Pepsi max
D. Other, usually it’s just. Drink. Or fizzy drinks, or In restaurants, soft drink 🇬🇧
D/other, im British, we say fizzy drink(s)
he cant quit :(
OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS HAPPENING
D. Where I grew up they were all called a "Cold Drink", even if they weren't cold, or "Coke". I rebelled and started using soda because it made more sense. Everyone understands either way, but anyone saying "Pop" gets weird looks.
The other Boylan drinks are good; Creme Soda, ginger ale, root beer, etc.
I prefer Pepsi Max Cherry is my favourite but why not try Pepsi Diet I refuse to drink coke as I prefer Pepsi all day most people were I'm from that is scotish I call it Soda
Coke Zero will always win my heart
"I quit diet coke" ha good one
Coke soda stream is bad
I actually work at a Food Lion in Virginia, and I was waiting to see if Food Lion would appear in the test.
The fountain one is just syrup and the carbonated liquid from the machine which is why it’s so sweet I think the can is better And yes we also sell that to restaurants  (I work as a vendor for Coca-Cola )
I grew up with C. All carbonated drinks are cokes.
We call it soft drink in Australia. As a kid I also called it fizzy drink. My fellow aussies can relate 😋
I’ve always referred to fizzy drinks generally as ‘Coke’ and I’m from the UK.
Coke all the way
Cough syrup....huh
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooossssssssssssssssssss yos
I feel like that static at 14:30 is gonna show up in another theory somehow. Maybe I've watched too many of his videos
AB  :  Soda Pop ;)  that's me... so chaotic here in the south aren't we?  XD
I say Soft Drink
Irn bru. It's the only soda you'll ever need ;)
I would recommend Irn Bru, except that it doesn’t meet any of the 3 criteria
what is happening to the youtube video lately, pewdiepie, penguinz0 and this video have this green flickers throughout the video, example at 9:41
Me kid 🧒🏻
Pepsi Max flavours tierlist
I was drinking diet coke while watching this. F
If you got your fountain diet Coke from McDonald's that is a totally different fountain diet Coke from the rest of fountain diet Cokes anywhere else
I saw the title and said "click between for sure." but wow 👏
From Virginia! It’s always been soda to me growing up, but some people say pop or coke and everyone just kinda knows what they mean
As much as I love mat                      I hate that coke didn't win 😑
PEEPISS
Try Chinotto Italiano All'Arancia. It's not a big name , but is good
I’m addicted to pepsi coke and that’s all I’ll drink (flavour water sometimes)
At 8:10 did anyone else see that green flashing over the video?
oop
Living in Phoenix, I’m so happy that Fry’s is on the list, genuinely hyped to try it out
The universe broke into 2 parallel world time lines when MatPat chose Harris Teeter.
We call it Coke here.   "What kind of Coke you got?" "We got Fanta, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, lemonade, water, and Budweiser."
anyone notice the glitches at 8:10 , 13:31 and 22:52 ? what are those about?
Me sees subnail impossible
I'm English (specifically Nothern English) so for me, it's either 'fizzy drink' or 'fizzy pop'. I'm not sure anywhere in the UK actually calls it 'soda' although I could be wrong about that.
“You’ve probably never heard of Foodlion” Me getting ready for my shift at Foodlion: lol
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Nice video btw
I'm a 'drink' guy. We don't say soda. Or pop. We say drink
4:05, there is a screen glitch, people who may think its something, check it out to see what it is. just trying to pick apart evert little detail.
Citric acid - the theory
Water should replace your soda addiction
15:28 D...my answer is D.. We usually call it "sopdrink"
18:19 Truly a couple goals moment for like the next minute
Coke brought this on themselves.  Shoulda made a deal when they had the chance.
next theory: what is the best type of food in terms of: -price -accesibility -ingredients -the amount of food that you consume  -and the precentage of residue it leaves on the plate
hear me out but! what if matt is wanda pecause that red jacket is really giving me wanda vibes! but hey that's just a theory! a mattpat theory!
me with 14 cans of coke zero on my desk be seeing the outcome be like
i prefer the classic coka cola
Mine would be D: Other, because it depends on the soda/coke. If I am addressing Coca-cola I'd say Coke, for any other I'd say soda.
Do the 10s. Dr Pepper 10, Root Beer 10, etc. They taste alot better than normal diet sodas, they don't leave that slightly bitter aspartame aftertaste, And they still have very low sugar.
Top ten anime betrayals
Fizzy drink here in Australia, or we just call it what it is
im coke
Sad
I heard that diet sodas have a chemical that the government had put into them that slowly kills you
15:32 answer D:other  it's either cola (like you would say "pepsi cola", what a way to dominate market coca-cola, well done) or  (I bet you can't pronounce it) "Napój gazowany" *or* "Napój słodki gazowany"
Feels like a good mythical morning episode
Matpat be puttin' a whole speech at 20:31
Issa a cold drank
Have u found the coke in your diet
*Ah yes, Diabetes.* 😂
You should try diet water
oh nyoo.
You know that things are getting META when MatPat quits Diet Coke.
*Ah yes, Diabetes.* 😂
I’m from the uk and maybe it’s just me and my friends and family but we call all of the “fizzy drinks” and then the drink by name if you’re being specific.
coke zero
Am I the only one who doesn't really like carbonated drinks
I call soda soft drink
Other: i call it «brus»
Here in New Zealand we call it fizzy drink lol. We’re so cultured
I'm not surprised, the Big K Cola from Kroger is hands down my favroite Cola, shy of only fountain/glass bottle Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
Am I the only one who noticed the green and yellow glitch on 13:30? Was that intentional or just an accidental glitch?
Now we all know to go paper in Rock paper scissors against either of them
What's the flash of green and blue bars between 4:05 to 4:07?  (Edit) There's another flash at 13:28 to 13:31  (Edit 2) Woah woah Woah, you got a place called Fry's over there?
I think that's truly delicious but Harris Teeter is not available here in Philippines 😅
I used to live in North Carolina for like 10 years and hearing Harris teeter and food lion really took me back
13:30 is laggy
Idk if anyone else it getting this but at 8:10 there's a glitch it happening on many YouTube videos now a days
We say pop down north in Canada
In Norway we have worlds best soda since 1966 Or it stands on the bottom
When we gonna get meme theory
bro i truly believe in diet coke supremacy! hahahaha
People, this video marks a change in history!!!
is anyone else noticing these weird green glitches throughout the whole video, or am i going crazy
Timestamp 18:00 MatPat says 13th, while the visuals say 10th.
Store brands unite
Time to go buy some soda
Pepsi max
Im dissapointed because you didn't try kofola.  Bruh, kofola is the best drink ever (its like coca cola but its from czech and it has a very specific taste)
13:30  Was that a camera glitch or something else?
New goal get sponsersd by Harris Teeter xD
What’s the weird screen effect at 13:30 I’m watching this at like 2 in the morning and thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but I rewinded for like a minute
Some colas are better as mixers
Australia: Soft Drink
In Egypt Depending on where you come from they could all be called peps or Coke-a. So I would call a Pepsi a coke-a and I could call a coke a peps.
15:30 i am D. because in our country we call it "limonaad" wich means lemonade
Me: i quit smoking matpat: i quit diet coke
Where I live we call them pops, sodas, sodapops, and soft drinks.
Dr Pepper is the BEST fizzy drink
4:05
Welp more for me
In Australia we call it “Soft Drink”, not soda.
This is just Mat's way to feed back into his addiction
Drink theory
Coke Zero gang rise up
I like milk madness better
I want to see all the new jokes in the theorist channels with the new soda
In Australia we call it a soft drink
coke
Wait, Mat is from NORTH CAROLINA?!?!?!?!?! I'm amazed that one of my top 3 favorite content creators lives in the same state as me!!!
I am unsubribeing I wanted xoke to win u r 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
Bro Harris teeter’s soda is literally 59¢ rn like... bro haha. Also I work there so Harris teeter has some loyal theorists working for them
wait that's illegal.
B-soda
Yes get out of that toxic relationship matpat
soda
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MATPAT, WHERE IS HE!!!!! IMPOSTOR!!!!!!!!!
How does this man not have a cola sponsorship yet?
try coke zero
Hopefully the new brand sponsor him.
we not gonna talk about how coca cola tastes different than diet/ coke zero?
A
Pop for the win!
MatPat be lovin Diet Coke in all of his life, but my grandad loves Coke Zero way back
8:30 Boylan makes some amazing non-diet sodas, including their regular and creamy red birch beers. But that unique and bold flavor profile doesn't work with diet sodas where, since you're dealing with artificial sweeteners, the more subtle, the better.
It is time for the Soda tournament arc !!!
Harris Teeter cola contains both Citric Acid and Potassium Benzoate, which produces a harmful chemical - Benzene. Be careful with this one
Who saw the title and laughed like " Okay sureeeee "
So after many years of nudging for a diet coke sponsore, we might see a Kroger sponsore lol
Pro Tip: Sam’s Cola Zero tastes WAY better than Diet Sam’s Cola. That’s what I drink every day.
I'm from northern ireland, and we call it all lemonade
Pepsi and fresh squeezed lime it great!
Coming from an area where Kroger is a very prominent brand, I can confirm that *every one* of their sodas (I don't drink diet, but it's probably consistent between regular sugar and sugar substitute) is a kicker. They have the soda game down pat, and if you really want to try a good one, their peach and pineapple are some of the best ones.
MatPat: Talking about tastes, coke flavours and comparing them.   Me: _wondering why would someone drink cola from a fountain_
Other - my is cold drink
Can you try 7up
Me sees the title Also me NOOOOOOOOO
there is nothing that can replace Diet Coke Pat, nothing.
He is not mat pat the theorist he is Mathew Patrick the guy
In Belgium food lion is called delhaize
Harris Teeter Diet Cola after this video: Stonks
Orange county  NC resident  here if your talking soda nc is homeland lol but mat you do science  you should really talk about how un healthy  diet sodas  are on a chemical  level...... also as a resident  ill tell  You that Harris tetter is known for higher  class people the majority of us  stick to Walmart and if your frisky  ur go  to food lion..
Im b
B
Just keep an eye on Kroger’s stocks over the next few days.
Tommyinnit collab when
12:31, 22:52 there is a frame with a glitch also I grew up with Soda
Matpat you busta, straight busta
Im drinking coke zero rn
There's an ingredient found in all diet drinks, that's actually used more heavily in coke zero, that makes it seem like it tastes better the more you drink it. That's why coke zero tasted so good at the end and almost won
Very interesting video, but sadly its all a moot point since it is a universal truth that anyone who likes diet soda is wrong and has no taste. Sorry Matt.
Matpat: Sodas with the cola flavor first......no twist  Me, a pepsi guy: did yall remember pepsi twist?
In romania there is food lion but the name is different but the logo is the same
My name is matthew also, hi matthew hope you read this! :)
#matpatclickbaitedus? This says he is quitting diet coke tho the video said nothing about him leaving it. DANG U CLICKPAT
This was just an excuse for mat to drink coke again and we all know it
D: other In Australia everyone I've known has always called it 'soft drinks'
Huh, feels like I've seen this exact video somewhere before. This concept seems veeery familiar
glitch at 13:30
Hm never knew there were so many diet coke options........anyway original Coca Cola will forever be KING!!!!!!
here in australia we call them soft drinks, sometimes soda but not a lot
13.31  Ok what is the secret text ? I cant read color   And D: un coca  Im french
Pop in ohio
Thats not a theory. Thats a fact
You mean this has nothing to do with Coca Cola's terrible racism lately?
I am just like Matpat but for Zero Coca-Cola becouse Diet Coke isn't really sold where I am living
Pepsi Max wins for me 10 out of 10 times, I dunno why but I get headaches from diet coke.
Oh I thought the other other thing was that Matt Patt wears a thong, but yeah I think he mentioned he likes diet coke once, I thought it was his way of referring to cocaine.
,ake a chanel called Book theories chanel
Can we talk about stephs posture 😳😳😳😳
we call em softdrinks
i think what ruined the last round was the fact that you were told which soda was which after each round. so later rounds were no longer blind tests, as you were familiar with each soda. so i guess that if ever need to do a blind test again that will last more then one round - don't revel the results of each winner after each round, revel them only after there is a clear winner. have future matpat narrate the results of each round.
down under we say soft drink.
The fruit loops episode I watch with my dad and any time we are the store  and he see’s fruit loops he says “I will never look and fruit loops the same
D
The fact matpat specifies; fountain, can, & bottle but not glass is absolute and utter soda heresy
When I saw this I was shocked
Drink water
D. Other we called it soft drink.
MatPat have you listened to the Magnus Archives yet. They are a horror podcast that is about to have its series finale. It is a truly amazing series. The gimmick is that they are statements submitted to a paranormal research group being recorded by a new archivist and his assistants. But as the story continues, names and concepts begin to reappear and it slowly builds into a Lovecraftian nightmare.
Only one can win irn bru
A: Pop
The fact that the cola they wanted to put in was unavailable, and Haris Teeter being the ONLY other one they could get...  Feels like a sign from the universe
Omg Steph is so pretty in this😵
food lion also exists there? for us its called mega image
Coke
WAIT WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!
the worst part of this for me is the fountain choice, if thats your taste just mix the other contestants 50/50 with water and they will taste similar
D. We always call any sort of soda, just 7up, even though i prefer coke, i just call them 7up
We in BiH say sok
He forgot glass bottle diet coke, then again i’ve only come across that at restaurants
I think food theory is my favorite because we get to see more of Matt and Steph together just having fun :D
Y’ALL FORGET ABOUT DIET RC COLA
Ewww.....diet anything is gross.  And Coke?  Ug...disgusting.
AY WHAT
In the UK we call them fizzy drinks 😋
YOU HAVE DISOBEYED THE LAWS FROM THE COUNCIL OF THE DIET COKE!
I live in north west Georgia and we have food lion here. I really like their sodas.
Oh the horror matt moved on to hress Teter :((((
My tongue rejects diet sodas, yet here I am.
MatPat: I quit diet coke!     909593 people: *interesting*
other: soft drink
its "soft drink" down here in Australia
Can you do a theory about whether diet sodas are actually more healthy than their non-diet counterparts?
Growing up in Canada, I've always called it Pop and thought that calling it soda was an American thing. Also, one thing I've noticed in my years of drinking pop, any brand that has a can, plastic bottle or glass bottle container, the glass bottle is usually the best tasting and plastic bottle is the worse.
Irn Bru Xtra
Did anyone notice the green lines at 4:06 ?? or is it just me
As a recovered Diet Coke addict, it was very fun to live vicariously through you. I do drink Zevia sometimes as a health compromise
Me coming from Australia I call carbonated sugar liquid fizzy
I kinda wanna have some of that Harris teeter. MatPat makes it sound so good.
matpat learned a valuable lesson here, his opinion does not matter. Happy wife = Happy life. agree agree agree
Eee
D. Other, us here down under surprisingly don't shorten in and say soft drink
Kroger brand ice cream is pretty good as well.
We live in a capitalist nightmare where we have the illusion of choice.  I'm a Soda guy. LOL
18:59 Best Moment hahaha
Why are you Americans so obsessed with diet coke? Here in Europe, the diet coke is just a disgusting version of normal coke. Does it have different artificial sweeteners? That would explain it...
"are you a A:POP B:SODA C:COKE D:OTHER" well in aus we just say D R I N K very simple and gets the job done.
I grew up in the Midwest, but was raised by a southerner in an area where it was soda, so I use soda and pop interchangeably, and weird out my friends
Harris teeter wasn’t on the list   Gets added anyways and wins
2132qw3e4r5t6gyuhi7y865432ew4rt5yughijhugvfccgty78909oiukjh
I’ve always called it soda pop. Never just one or the other.
*sad asian noises*
What kinda of Soda do you have? I’ll have a Dr. Pepper or a Coke
Diet Coke: Mat you were the chosen one!
fizzy drinks -.-
I'm allergic to citric acid :,(
between 13:30 - 13:31
Just so you know the company's you just mentioned are all sister companies of Kroger's
love that they clarified AND Florida like yeah it is basically its own country down here lmao
Welp I’m unsubscribeing
i keep hearing you say P### and not waht you said weird
Idk if I’m weird but I absolutely HATE soda in all seriousness it makes me sick 🤢and I’m not trying to be dramatic I’m more of a juice gal u know
I have Harris Teeter and Food Lion near me in Virginia nwn glad to see stores I know and love represented!
Where I am we call soda fizzy drinks/soft drinks
1:13 "he gave up diet coke for all of 2020" flash back to the chicken wings episode where he drank diet coke
Florida is Florida, no one wants to be associated with Florida.
You look 17 again
I haven't had a coke or diet coke in the last 15 years... Keep on watching anyway
Her on the isle of man we say 'fizzy' like what kind of fizzy do u want
This is one of the biggest top 10 anime betrayals.
How do you get fountain Diet Coke?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
p1:pop p2:soda! *gunshot* buster: buckshot cleetus: CLEETUS!
"It tastes terrible!"  takes another sip
I switched from dr pepper to zevia
I feel confused maybe I'm just really not in the know but..... I'm seeing green lines across the screen at separate times and I have no idea what that is
b4 i watch this..i dont believe it for a second...lies matpat  LIES!!
Which one was the healthiest though?
couldve sworn food lion looks like the indonesian brand "Super Indo"
I refer to it as only pop, yet I do it ironically. But I never say soda
First off, had I known you guys were in North Carolina, I wouldn't  have moved. I've been wanting to meet you guys forever. Second, I call it "soda". And lastly, I'm a sucker for both Coke Zero and Diet Coke. If Coke Zero isn't available, Diet Coke is my immediate backup. When I saw that you included both, I was seriously torn between the two until I considered this: When going on long road trips, McDonald's Diet Coke is far superior than both. I don't know what it is, but it tastes significantly better than the originals.
This is the most serious video about cola I have ever seen
South Texas here. All "soda" is Coke until otherwise specified.
Well they don't have big K Smith's Kroger and Fred Meyers all sell it even though I thought the K stood for Kroger  Edit I saw the end of the video and I'm still shocked they have more brands WTF
D: Other Soda water
here in the uk most of us call it pop
I'm a soft drink
Drink "Lupina" its a green can with some nice liquids
no diet coke "drinks coke zero"
THE BEST YOUTUBER IS BACK POGGGGGF
creating atrificial sweetener: Mark:"lets call it Markia" Steve: "I have a better idea"
There is a Dillion’s near me I’ll go get some of their big k tomo
California checking in with the soda!
i use pepsi max sirup for sodastream, it really tastes like pepsi max and you can slightly change its taste by using more or less sirup. And it is cheap, like half the cost of a regular pepsi max
I was an oil mixer for a popcorn plant, not to be mentioned, but a lot of name brands and store labels are either the very same or really close in the mixture of how they are produced. Kroger was an extremely different mix from every brand I mixed. I even had to flush out the tank before filling it with their mix.
boyland is amazing and has other flavors
I pick option D I'm Polish so for me it's called napój gazowany
Soda specialist stores is the most American thing I can think of
D: We here actually call it "karastusjook".
4. Softdrink
Matpat: It's all Coke! Me: Always has been...
I don't drink soda, but my family only drinks Diet Sams Cola
I'm proud of you Matthew. We had been worried about you.
Other I call it fizzy drink
in australia we either say fizzy drink or we just say what we want
Rip Virgin Cola and Panda Pop Cola
Insert thanos "Impossible"
Did you consider Tab? Also from Coca-Cola and was apparently the first diet drink.  In my opinion it has a flavor that's similar to the European "Coca-Cola Light" which is a little more tart than American "Diet Coke".
in India we were always cold drink not coke not pop not soda. plain old cold drink
Matpat is a HUGE part of my childhood, So when i woke up today and read the thumbnail, my heart dropped thinking "wait...he quite youtube!?WHAT WH- WHY" then i read the title and exhaled in relief.
The perfect video for me
In Australia here, it's either fizzy drinks or soft drinks (at least in South Australia). It feels so weird to hear it called soda and pop...
Guys diss is the reality the big bad food giants are not good and they are the one who makes us create steryotypes to hate loval brands neglecting da fact dat loval brands are better
"Food Theory: I QUIT Diet Coke!" that's not a theory Mat  A statement, a declaration, an announcement, but not a theory.
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
Harris Teeter is gonna make a lot of money after this
Food theory always makes me hungry Even when its about soda pops
I like how in the competition one is orange and one is blue like Godzilla vs king kong which is what matt did not so long ago.
4:06 13:31
what about heath theory +
After 1 million people watch duss and go buy harris teters  Harrus teters be like : we have won the cola competition without even steping into it
D: Cola
I only know matt as the guy who miss labeled a game as undertale
In Australia a lot of the time it gets called fizzy drink or soda
in australia we call soda soft drink, no clue why
I just quit all carbonated drinks, so you clickbaited me a little lol
Stefany looked so pretty today
why
Food Lion is actually a Belgian supermarket chain called 'Delhaize', even their logo is the same lion.
As a stevia fan I-
Why self hurt Mat Pat?
*he quits it because he never gets sponsored*
A lot of my favorite YouTubers are in North Carolina
MAT PAT you're addicted to diet coke I can't blame you its very good
Just drink pepesi max
I gotta say it. Your wife is pretty hot. Well done sir!
I grew up calling it soda and I thought that everyone else either said pop or soda-pop. I never heard of coke being used as a synonym of soda.
pepsi max
Anyone just skip to the end to see the winner?
It's litterally the ghost kitchen thing but with generic brand stuff
We grew calling soda's 'fizzy drinks' or just 'fizz'.
@17:28 Literally hard lesson to learn as a kid, when you find out your allergic to Citric Acid. It's in everything, it's so hard to avoid. I can have it at small quantities but if I have to much if it too close together I get sick. Where the same amount a normal person is fine. Like super sick. When it's a product that's not food that has Citric acid, I have to avoid it entirely. Anytime a friend has a makeup person or I go to the Salon U have to tell the people there I can't use any products with Citric Acid.
Is.....aspartame bad. Are you not suppose to consume it?
Matpat-quits diet coke Pewdiepie - ends his minecraft series Worst day ever
Well he did it, he found a way to feed his addiction and make it a business expense😂😂
I can wait for the "Only og's will remember Mats Diet coke addiction" comments
I'm hungry and I'm watching food theory What's wrong with me
Mat: soda, pop or coke Me an Indian: Thanda lao re koi 😂 (Thanda literally translated just means 'cold')
Where is senku’s cola
You should have tasted the other one before saying what you tasted. Because it may skew the results in a way. In a psychological way HAHAHAHHAHAH anyways. It's all fun and games, a game theory. Thanks for reading.
This is the best tournament arc where the unexpected underdog wins.
...Did no one else see the weird flash at like 13.30? When Matt says "Diet soda flavour"?
R.I.P diet coke
Interesting captions at 3:47
Food lion was first established in Belgium and is named Carrefour
Why did he not make the joke that his allegiance is to the republic(((
Am I the only one who can’t really tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi?  Tbh imo they taste the same
✨It’s fruity✨
Zevia is my go to. :p but I’ve been drinking topo Chico and other mineral waters.
At this point it isn’t even theory’s it’s just excuses to eat and drink
D
Alternate tittle: Mathew has his dream to drink all available coke brands in the usa.
Just want to point out that cola is the worst soda claver fallowed closely by grape. I have no idea why this is the case but I've always assumed that's what motor oil would taste like minus the carbonation.  I always thought Dr pepper was similar to cola but different just like how mountain dew is similar to Sprite and 7UP but slightly different
Not that I’m counting or anything jk  I totally am but this is the 39th video!
here in the philippines it's sop drinks
Let me let you in on a secret! If you go to any of those stores and you have a point card you can use it at any of those locations  and get discounts  because  they use the same operating system
D (fizzy
I have a Krogers in my town, maybe I may try the BigK Diet cola to see if it has said flavor.
Well I live in Oklahoma and we do not have a Kroger or it's subsidiaries here
I bet scott will release the next fnaf and then a video called "I'm addicted to diet coke again..." will be uploaded.
Having lived on both the west and east coasts... I can tell you that these test are very much regionally based.   In the east (specifically Pensacola Florida) Pepsi was.... Eww.  But I grew up in Seattle, and now live back on the correct side of the country. And I'll tell you, Pepsi is the king.
13:31 what was that?
c
In Czechia we call them “kola” so I guess we’re team coke?
Point of order: You should have used the Diet Coke you purchase most often. If you typically have 2 liter bottles at home that should have been in the competition. I personally would take a fountain drink over bottle every single time. A Harris Teeter fountain probably doesn't even exist. Just a thought.
Everything is a coke.
In Australia, we call Soda "Soft Drink" or "Fizzy Drink"
Soda gang
@ 14:40 I Love how MatPat says "you've probably never heard of food lion" and I'm sitting here laughing because I grew up goin to food lion.. granted, I'm from NC... but if your from new england, I've  learned that it's from the same company that runs hannafords
What? nOt DiEt cOkE
So I can't actually drink about 90% of these colas, because I'm sensitive to aspartame and it gives me a splitting migraine with even a very small amount... but in the regular cola department, I choose Pepsi first and Sam's second  PS: It's /clearly/ soda, pop is what you'd call it if you were in an 1800's western movie =P
I didn't saw the video But even I know that's muffin-poop
I'm soda
*Back from when I worked in fast food* Customer: Can I get a coke Me: Sure thing *Starts filling up a cup with coke and ice* Customer: I didn't say what I kind I wanted yet. Me: ...?
What is this timeline because it sure isn't mines
I wouldn't be surprised if the krabby patty secret formula had citrus acid in it.
I'll never forget the sans is ness thing it sometimes keeps me up at night (jk it's just something I think about when other demons keep me up at night)
Try Mirinda
13:30 there's some glitched footage
Me sitting In AUSTRIA wanting that freaking Harris and Teeter coke.... can someone ship it to me ?XD
13:30  someone tell me into being van asbestos drink diet coke by that flash
Impossible
Is your love of diet soda the reason you won't do a video about aspartame? 🤔
Just drink regular coke
In Finland we call soda "limsa" which is a shortened term of "limonadi" which I think comes from "lemonade". I think there might be multiple things we call soda in different regions of Finland but I don't know
Pop in the UK
Here in Australia, we call it soft drink.
Lmao it’s always been a consensus in our family that Kroger brand pops are equal to name brand ones
Coke, I'm from Czech Republic and to us everything is a Coke :D
I want gordon ramsey to show up in this show
Root Beer and Dr. Pepper > literally any Cola
Matpat got a diet coke addiction when I got a Dr pepper addiction lol
D: Soft Drink        I don't know why
R.I.P Australia
D. Other  We call it sopdrinks
They should do more rankings like these, I'd love to see them do this with Monster flavours
Stephanie was like: "ARE YOU THE SAME MAN I MARRIED?!?!!? WHO ARE YOU!?"
I am a coke guy
Because of this episode got to find out that the nearest big city closest to me just had their Kroger's closed down at the end of January. Also found out that according to google Kroger's has a valued orientated division called Ruler Foods, which is in that city that had their Kroger closed down. What an interesting find.
Boy how dare you disrespect food lion
In a GT live recently Mat and Steph said their brains were wired the exaxt same, and this rock paper scissors match just confirmed that 😂
Fun fact food lion is also in Delaware
Im a pepsi max man myself
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Then there's all us not in the US (I'm UK) who can't try any of them...
Sinalco cola is good
CITRIC ACID IS THE SECRET RECIPE IN THE KRABBY PATTY
The wiggly cappelletti genetically close because gateway taxonomically stir qua a drab onion. perfect, impossible mice
We say coke but here in Malaysia we don't have that many variety of Diet Cola drinks lmao
Gotta weigh in on the terminology here XD most of my childhood, I was a soda girl, but then I got two younger sisters who could hear the word "soda" from three rooms away, and I got tired of having to share my soda with them whenever I asked to have one, so I learned and taught mom the ASL sign for soda, which, if I remember correctly, translates to "soda pop", for use when asking mom to avoid little ears catching note XD now, though, I tend to sign along side verbally asking, so it's a tossup XD
Isn't diet worse for you? It replaces natural sugar with artificial sweetener i don't have the specifics but I have heard that it is a lot worse for you
its called a food theory... but its a drink theory
As a North Carolinian, I approve of this NC-based grocery store diet propaganda video! Edit: Soda, but hearing Coke as a generic Soda terminology is pretty standard, too.
What did you use for a pallet cleanser between rounds
Episode Idea: Plant-based meat taste test. can people actually taste the difference?
I shall say what people are going to say, LITTLE NIGHTMARES 2!!!!!!!
the final three is basically WrestleMania XXX.
We need a citric acid episode because wasn’t that also the reason kfc taste a certain way
I say pop because I’m from Michigan lol
Why are you using straws?
Here in the uk we call the drinks what there called lol
Hey matoat i live in the UK and i really wish i could have some of the cola
Speaking of regional sodas only found in the Carolinas, I think Cheerwine needs some love
Why not glass bottle Diet Coke? It's easily the best one.
These two were made for each other what are the odds 6 times in a row
Matpat I really love how you came back with a diet coke  tasting video✌😁🥤
BCR here from Pepsi and idk why I got so hype when caffeine free Pepsi and Pepsi zero won in the first round I don’t even drink the stuff lol.
DON,T ask for coke in the Netherlands
servers Coke right for not sponsoring him years ago Hahahaha
When I saw this video’s title and thumbnail, I was like “WHAT? HOW DID HE DO THIS? WHY DID HE DO THIS?” but the most I reacted was I opened my eyes more
Dr Pepper is better. FIGHT ME
I’m from England, we call it fizzy drink. Also, what are seeds? You kept mentioning how the drinks were 3rd seeded, 15th seeded, etc, but what does that mean?
Congratulations man, addiction is very difficult to overcome. :)
Mat: I quit drinking diet coke  Stephanie later finds matpat in a tub of diet coke, shaking, whispering, "T H E  C O K E  C O N S U M E S  U S  A L L"
What`s up with the visual glitches at 4:05, 8:10, 9:42, and 13:31?  They are quite random.
Heratic may the gods punish you for thine transgressions against our beloved drink
Literally everyone after mat likes something more than dier coke: Impossible
how so is food lion a regional chain when its litteraly a global company topping belgium and france
Matpat loves DIET COKE more than EVERYthing,including his wife.
Harris teeter secretly the mc
If it is Kroger, Rhett and Link would be proud :D
I'm allergic to Aspartame and I agree with them about Stevia. So for me it's either real sugar or Sucralose.
Coca Cola Zero if you want to keep drinking Coca Cola. Otherwise Pepsi Max is a good choice.
FIZZY DRINK
yo Kroger has my fave diet sodas
8:09 why was dream there
This video feels like something Good Mythical Morning Would do LOL
I'm a classic coke purist. Diet and zero just, doesn't the same, and doesn't taste pleasing to me. Sure, the amount of sugar is not good for me, but it's generally the only soft drink I have. I drink a variety of tea/coffee/hot drinks, water, water with cordial, so I'm not just exclusively drinking the fizzy syrup.  Also draught(fountain) is always the best form of a soft drink because the syrup and the carbonation are mixed from the tap.  But they're  just an opinion.
Well at least steph and I prefer the same Cola
Like Steph being from the south usually just coke as a general term or soda
Memes legend is dying :|       Uh oh...
You forgot coca cola 0
I normally say pop, however I’ve been thinking, what if I call it Fizzy Mat drinks?
RC is a delicious softdrinks it taste like coke but better
Diet schwip schwap. Try it!
In belgium we call it fris drank meaning cold drink

Never doubt the local chains.

Do y'all not have rc cola near you?  Not all stores have diet, but it's my favorite.  Also mat and steph are too cute with all their ties.
Hey can I just ask around if someone else saw the occasional discomfort, and or unwanted to be there of Ms. Stephanie... cause she doesn't look too enthusiastic sometimes, and when she does it sometimes looks forced... that's just what I saw...
My pasta is watching TV
HOW

Matpat in the thumbnail looks different
If you can quit Diet Coke, I can quit drinking.
The reason 2020 was so bad is cus Mat stopped drinking Diet Coke
I like your cut g
13:31, anyone else see that magical glitch?
I’m from the south, and I have only ever heard people call soda soda. Never have I met somebody who has called all soda coke
go to 3:44 and turn on subtitles
This was more thrilling than I ever would have thought.
FOOD! OBEY THE SERVER!
I'm from Southern Illinois and I usually just call each drink by its name if not I call them Soda.
Nah, you say Läskeblask
Morrisons coke is good
in New Zealand we call it Fizz or Fizzy drink 🤣
In the uk we just call it either by its name or a shortened version
Dating Show is no more, only Dietcoke Show
When I asked for a Diet Coke theory this isn’t what I meant.
Water : why nobody love me T_T
pov you're watching this from Europe 👁️👄👁️
Matpat I'm real happy for you and I'mma let you finish... But what's the theory?

Food lion 🤣 you mean Delhaize ? Haha, hello from Belgium
B. Soda (In India)
All C. Coke requester here!
in france coke is called coca cola but we just say coca like "do you whant a coca?"
I guess you could say... Matpat was really TEETERING on his decision
I call them soft drinks and their name. Like Coke Zero, Coke, etc.
I never saw this video coming
I just watched two fully grown adults rate sodas all day and I don’t know how to feel about that
10:32  And the reason why you are not allowed is because of whacks and conspiracy theorists pushing out agenda that aspartame is harmfull because of handfull studies which fed aspartame in EXTREME quantities to rats. Extreme as in order to get the same dose you would have to chug around 50 liters of coke in one sitting extreme.   Aspartame is safe and anyone who says otherwise is eighter uneducated or a fucking moron. Nothing else.
I went from Coke to Coke Zero a couple years ago, I never liked DietCoke. also when I was a kid, Pespi was the name for all sodas. go figure..
*looks at title*  Me: impossible
In Europe most of the countries call coke coca cola
Burger smoothie carbonated by the home carbonators is my go to drink
Why does the screen become green randomly? It's not my phone.
This is haikyuu in a nutshell but Diet Coke.  I love it.
Big red is my favorite
Fun fact, coke is supposed to have the flavor of lime/orange and cinnamon mixed in, so technically coca cola is definitely a "fruity" soda, but the flavors are combined so well that it's hard to notice them, until you know that it's there and go looking for them. Next time you drink coca cola (Or even pepsi) you might notice them after reading this comment.
GLASS BOTTLE!!!!! Diet Coke out of a glass bottle is the best Diet Coke
I’m a Soda type of person, but the rest of my family is Pop
softdrink
okay wait why did fountain coke get a spot but not fountain for anything else on the bracket?
Other: fizzy drinks
He quit diet coke?! IMPOSSIBLE!
*i quit diet coke* me: He did the imposible
....
Hey I have an idea for a cola it's called cola energy it's cola energy drink nk
Jacksepticeye wouldn't aprove of this
Y do I feel like he loves Diet Coke more then Stephany...?🤔
In Australia it’s called soft drink so my answer is, D other
Diet coke better sponsor matpat eventually
D:I call them refrescos.I'm not American
I am läsk and swedish
So duh... Saying pop makes me think of pop tarts. I prefer soda, even if some of my family only says pop.
Me: Sees video Also me: Who are you and what have you done Matpat? Has the FNAF theories got to youi? To quit the nectar of the Gods?!!!
once we had a food lion here in maryland
Great Video Matpat!
It's called fizzy pop
Mine is E: water
My grandma (a Peoria native) called it sodie, short for sodie pop
I always get store brands since they're cheaper
20 minutes in and I'm wandering why YOU DONT GET A THIRD PERSON
I call my fizzy drinks ‘other’ idk abt you
I read the title and screamed “NOOO”
Try Irn Bru it’s a Scottish-only fizzy drink made with a secret recipe and it’s amazing
Yeah mad respect Steph, love Coke Zero! You should try it from Sonic, they make it with Splenda. Coke Zero with vanilla from there is my favorite drink to get. 😁😋
What if I am a sodie pop???
what about Diet RC! Tradition of the south (but so is coke a cola and Pepsi)
Here in Australia we call it soft drinks
B
D:fizzy
Zero calorie beverages are actually less healthy for. They dont fire the metabolism. Low calorie soda fires the metabolism so it actually gets burned off
I can tell you as a fact that coke tastes better from the glass bottle
Hey food theorist, I have a theory and idk why it's like this but why does Reeses Easter Egg candy taste a lot better than any reese's out there, even Reeses Halloween pumpkin and Reeses Christmas trees are about the same shape and size but for some odd reason I would 100% say the Reeses Egg taste a lot better (I have a few people who say the same idk if it's just me)
Good Matpat I was getting worried about your love for diet coke
Pop
No more soda, it's all sugar
Me: see's tittle  Also me: haha prob clickbait
Harris Teeter will have a sudden unexplainable rise in diet coke
Why are you leaving your Diet Coke addiction? You were the one who got me into Diet Coke...
Soft drink
B: soda  here in California
Plot Twist:They Use Dr.Pepper
This is a historic day
Jarritos is the best soft drink, you can't change my mind. There're some not so great flavors, but some of the really good ones include Lime, Lemon-Lime, Mandarin, Watermelon, Mango, Guava, and Strawberry.  As for cola flavored things, uh... Caffeine free coke wins, I think. I'm not a huge fan of the caffeine flavor (not that I can describe what it tastes like), and caffeine itself doesn't affect me much at all, I just don't metabolize it.
Just wanted to say that in England we call “sodas” fizzy drinks.
Impossible
Wait is it bad if i drinked more cola than water in my life?
So I grew up in Columbus Ohio, My Mom was from Southern Ohio, and my Dad was from Connecticut. Both of my parents call generic Cola flavored soda Coke. Me and all of my friends say soda.
Me and Diet Coke are in a relationship
Wait why are you quitting Diet Coke?! What makes it worse than other sodas?! What's happening?!
Harris teeter cola is like the weird homeless guy who’s actually a legendary hero in every anime
Noooooooooooi
Here in India, we call it Coke.
I have always said pop
I can't wait to for next years March Matness, I wonder what it will be?🤔
Slowly but surely the people of YouTube will reverse engineer Matt and Steph’s home address.
IMPOSSIBLE
fun fact some cokes are the same but more sugary or stronger aroma and other you should drink teh less sugary ones
A pop
Lol this is gona blow up soon
“After six consecutive rock paper scissor ties, we took it as a sign from the universe to start a three way”- matpat
Soft Drink here in Australia
I'm pop
They forgot he's also the man that simultaneously wipped and nayyed
I'm from Virginia and we call it soda. We have Harris Teeter and Food Lion too. The Food Lion brand of Dr. Pepper "Dr. Perky" is actually very good.
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT COLAS IN GLASS BOTTLES TASTE BETTER THAN ANY COLAS THAT EXISTS...  FIGHT ME  >:0
I don’t like fizzy drinks
It makes sense that NC based store chains would have decent-to-good store-branded colas considering Pepsi-Ca was born in the Carolinas. It stands to reason they would know they have a high bar to clear in terms of quality. 🤷‍♀️
Drink sparkling water, it has carbonation like a soda just no sweetener.
Me and my mom drink zivia 24/7
C
Ah yes matpat artificially inflating the price of Harris Teeter diet cola.
Here in Norway we call soda brus
COOL DRINK!
Fizzy lol its a kiwi thing
I see this soda at Fred Myers and I had it at my birthday and I liked it and can say that it does have a fruity taste to it
stop at 4:09 and u got yourself the perfect mattpat meme template
That meme at the end 😆
@15:31 In the Philippines it's Coke.
...Tommorow is spring
Just wanted to say that in England we call “sodas” fizzy drinks.
You just should try Guaraná Antartica from Brazil. That's it #ComGuaranaNãoDaPraErrar
They are all diet coke
As a Kroger employee I can almost guarantee that the store brand sodas sell better than our name brand... Unless we're out or it's a flavor that we don't do a lot of people prefer Big k as we call it here. Top of that there are some very interesting flavors that typically aren't made  such as like peach, or blue raspberry.
Water Matt, WATER!!!!!!!!
Fun fact: North Carolina has the most competition in grocery stores. Over a dozen different stores can be found in the same city without any repeats. There are about 2 dozen in my city and around 8 of them are from the same company. That isn't including mega stores like Walmart, Target and Sam's Club. I used to work for Lowe's Food (not related to the hardware store Lowes) were I found out how diverse the market here is.
It's soft drink. But I'll also give fizzy drink a pass
I would try the German Cola brand Fritz Cola  from Hamburg it will be expencive in deliviery but it is delicious
It's absolutely baffling to me that food lion was a south east thing (I'm from south carolina and you cant go 10 miles without seeing a food lion at least the part of south carolina I'm from) so it was wierd to learn it wasn't a nationwide thing.
Oh my
The Rock Paper Scissors part shows just how perfect these two are for each other.
Them: *playing R.P.S* Me: Great minds think alike!
Pepsi pleas fornthe live of god
Its to bad that Mat didint get to try Appelsín thats a so f#$*%g good soda from Iceland
I’m Norwegian, and here is soda is called: «Brus»
Pokémon Sparkling Cider.....Do it, Do it, DO IT, D O I T
Stevia is amazing, but its very easy to overdo due to it being so incredibly sweet. Even 1% more stevia can turn perfect sweetness into overwhelmingly sweet.
A. POP
This weirdly feels like drag race but if the filler queen was actually the winner of the season.
Imma soft drink person
It’s no joke I love Diet Coke. Always have Always will. Also Coke Zero. Don’t like Diet Pepsi or Pepsi zero. Both taste to sweet to me and Diet Pepsi taste weird. Now for one that’s interesting. A lot of people love DR PEPPER which is good but I like PIBB EXTRA. Also the Food city brand which is DR THUNDER. Also Wal mart is good to.
I guess here in Western Australia, I hear soda a lot, but I`ve always said soft drink, which covers a lot of products, or we go by brand names
Am I the only one that knows 'soda' as soft drink or is that only in Australia?
Huh...next time I go to *insert Kroger chain here* maybe I'll grab their store brand diet soda.
I will always call a soda 'coke'. You can't stop me.
Harris teeter go crazy
B soda
D:I call it soft drink
I say “soft drink”
Impossible...
Mat pat mat pat just drink rc coke
Down in Australia, we have a Bundaberg Cola that my dad loves
You better chug well my man
The arg people are gonna have fun with this episode lmao
That's impossible
Did matpat create this channel because someone gave him idea that he should make a food theory? I'm new here
i'm a soda kinda guy but i don't drink it often
I will tell you you should try sprite or try limca
I call coke drugs but for everyone
The dapper curtain dimensionally rinse because hurricane decisively form with a alcoholic cafe. general gentle, sweet patio
I’m from Virginia and there’s a Harris Teater and a Food Lion right next to my house
Boys we’ve found the krabby paddy recipe it’s CITRIC ACID.
Coke should've sponsored him before
Ok but how the heck are people in the UK get it? Useless
All of Kroger's private label brands are made by "Inter-American" of Cincinnati, OH. I searched "Harris Teeter Interamerican" on Google and got the manufacturer on several hits on HT's website.  (Source: Lives in Cincinnati. Worked at a Kroger.)
please dont stop drinking coke / diet coke . its amazing ... but its not healthy  sooo drink little but keep it up (itss yourr brannndd )
Now hold on.  Based on the averages of all their rankings of the final three it should be a three way tie.  Coke Zero: Ranked 3 and 1. Harris Teeter: Ranked 3 and 1. Diet Coke: Ranked 2 and 2.  Those all average out to 2.  So....nobody wins? Everyone wins? Idk.  Whichever ending you prefer xD
Soda
Florida says soda because we’re not crazy
Without even watching the video i can say dont drink diet soda. Don't drink any soda.
I’m gonna say it.  some of us called it fizz.
Should of went with dark brown cups to make it hard to tell difference in color.
Based on my childhood in Kentucky, a mix of both C. coke and B. Soda. occasionally 1 kid or another would say pop
b:soda
No, no, Steph has a point. The rest of the Southeast definitely doesn't claim Florida past Jacksonville. (Specifically, the Two Toucans restaurant near the Florida Georgia line.)   Signed-a North Carolinian born of a Panama City Beach native.  EDIT: Husband just reminded me that we DO claim the tip of the state, since Miami is basically just Northern Havana. (Cosigned--A Miami native.)
C (Though most people here in Australia use Soft Drink for most Cokes)
hang on i have a theory matpat read this  so matpat LOVES diet coke and says in old videos , he would never give it up so all those glitches are showing that someone else  is pratending to be him, like when he did a video on DAD how he is getting controlled he liked that idea and so he is now doing it
pepsi max
My theory matpat is sponsored by coke 🤯 secretly
Holly your not seriously quitting?
down under we call it fizz or fizzy drink
Fizzy
Food Lion is also in Tn.
COKE, everything is coke.
7:55 I mean soda's where tonics at first, which you did get from a pharmacy.
Other, in Holland we call it Fresh. What do you want to drink? Something fresh please, they mean soda right there.
anyone else see the glitch
Tomorrow morning I will go to my local Dillon's Marketplace and see if their diet soda tastes like Harris Teeter and report back if I remember lol
Hm here in Europe the Fointain Sodas are usually bad and taste totally chemical. would love to know how the Harris Teeter compares to a bottled Diet Coke. I just think that the Fountain Soda is the winner from the runup, but you don't have a soda fountain in your home. Or do you?
imagine if hes sponsored
In New Zealand we say fizzy drink
Are you okay. Like seriously. If MatPat quits Diet Coke he is not okay. full stop.
As a Michigander, I can say I am a A It is 'pop' and always will be :3
I like c:coke
well time to import harris teeter in order to try it
ima pepboi
Finally someone who likes Coke Zero. I thought I’m a freak when I say I like Coke Zero and people ridiculed me
JACK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THIS TIME!? (inside joke btw)
Coke zero is my favorite type of Coke
We have Food Lion hear in Kentucky. Also, yes. There is no Soda or Pop here. Everything is Coke.
ok am i dumb, (probably) or has MatPat not mentioned it.  He lives in North Carolina?
You know how clickbait tjhat title was ahah
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
sodie
Shut up need lmao
That was shocking!
uhhhhh matpat quick question why does it in random videos it glitches with the green thing is this some theory we have to solve?!?!?!??!??!      right down your theory
Pop. Kansas represent. (I say "soda" a lot now because I moved, but I always said pop. I should go back to saying pop)
D: Other - Fizzy drink. That is what the aussies call it.
D: Fizzy Drink
Why no glass coke
d
Soda
I haven't watched it yet, but I think Pepsi Max will win
Australia is soft drink
Pepsi max
C. Other - Fizzy or soft drink
D/Läsk I am from sweden
Is no one going to question the green flash at 8:10?????
I’m a B I’m not really a pop or coke guy myself
This is what coke gets for not ever spomsoring matpat :P
Anyone notice 13:31 new ARG coming up?
The fourth theory channel should do similar content to this as this is an idea that is interesting, such as that charcoal and gas grill episode. Idk a name. Maybe verses theory. Or some other synonym for verses.
MATPAT PLEASE TRY THIS COLA IT'S THE BEST http://us.bulls-head.com/shop/drinks-en/natural-cola/
I happen to be lemonade.
Wait you live in north Carolina.
I call it soda pop
Mat: let me explain what this flavour is  Also mat: *not good*
Matpat:"ewwww! This one is horrible! *Keeps drinking it*" Harris Teeter really is the underdog
Up here in the North West, it’s usually called “soda.” Also, half expected a joke involving Ollie getting into the soda.
I like a lot of Boylan's.  I am also an aficionado for soda, but my preference is craft sodas so I can be a hipster with craft beer drinkers lol
matt quitting diet coke: the whole matt pat community:*intense screaming*
The day MatPat lost his identity
When matpat starts to quit diet coke that's how you know he is depressed
15:29 I'm Other, im a "Attack Helicopter"
I’m water
Glass bottle soda is the best
Ok matpat from one Diet Coke addict to another...       THERE IS NO WAY THAT FOUNTAIN DIET COKE IS THE BEST CAN IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST FOUNTAIN HAS BEEN FILTERED OUT WITH ICE AND WATER SO THEY DONT PAY AS MUCH  and here I am thinking you have good taste buds
d i call it fizzy
No offense, but i hate diet stuff: i dislike artificial sweetner, it just does not work for me    + my opinion if you want sweet stuff stand to it and eat the calories... litteraly
americans: "SODA" "NO, POP" "NO, SODA" "NO, POP" Me, a New Zealander: ... Fizzy  No seriously here we call them either fizzy or what the drink is actually called
going to ralph’s to find out
My language arts teacher looks and sounds just like Stephanie not even joking some times I think they are the same person
we call it fizzy here in nz
we call it soft drink-
In the Philippines we call it softdrinks
"Food Theory: I QUIT Diet Coke!" *Top 10 anime betrayals*
When y’all when talking about how we shouldn’t put off store brands I was like y’all should try dr. Dazzle
in south africa , we all just say cooldrink , so we can't even be involved in the soda vs pop debate
It doesn't surprise me that Diet Coke never paid Mat Pat. They didn't need to. He already talked about it to an unhealthy extent. I personally can't stand any flavor from any diet drink.
Wtf mattpat my whole life was lie
When I first saw the thumbnail I was like  this is so sad Alexa play despasito
So if you think about it, MatPat been hitting this place, his LOCAL supermarket, for however long he been living where he does nowadays, AND WAS SLEEP ON THAT HARRIS TEETER LMAOOOOOO
It's like your saying i quit drinking garbage by big corporations
Foodsco always has Kroger labeled stuff. I've even seen the Giant label on them.
Here in aus we call it soft drink
We go to Kroger all the time.
Soda. I don’t understand people who say pop. Especially when y’all call fridges ice boxes
I would have liked if you rated them for 1-10 and still did the tournament but pls do a Dr Pepper bracket
My friend drinks 1 liter of coke- I'm worried
Coke Zero is better than Diet Coke
I THOUGHT PUBLIX WAS A FLORIDA THING!!! LOL
nice clicbait since man i aint giving you the view..haza....now i wana watch
fizzy drink
sprite is best
Ok idk if anywhere else this is the case but here in India we call all the sodas or whatever "cold drinks" and like non soda drinks just drinks ig. Any fellow Indian theorists can back me up/prove me wrong.
try adding citric acid to diet coke...
oh so he is leaving his  addiction  Mattpatt: this is a chance  to replace Diet Coke
D: soft drink
Imagine calling it soda this post was made by pop gang. Actually I really don’t care you do you.
Coke= like  Pepsi=comment 'pepsi'
Great now there's gonna be a huge insurgence in the sales of harris teeter diet cola!
March mattness
I feel like such a big brain bc I actually kewn about diet sodas actually being worse than sodas
B.  Soda!
Unrelated but...Can we have a Game Theory about TJOC
The addiction IS OVER
D in australia we call it soft drink
I have never seen matpat so passionate about something. His passion for Diet soda is moving.
b
I recommend Sam's Zero over Sam's Diet Cola
Very sad, no Swedish Cuba Cola, but understandable
You live in North Carolina , the Pepsi state there is no place I know they call it all come here.
Me who only knows soft drink: Ok
I recommend the coca-cola with purple coloring. I don't remember what fruit was added to it, but the label and cap were purple and only available in 2.5L bottles. Oh, I can vouch for stevia, I don't quite remember if stevia a single sugar molecule or something else. For starters, I recommend continually drink that coke, that the flavor doesn't get too much. I'd like to know in a family of pseudo-scientists, why does the girlfriend say "it tastes chemical" when literally anything else is also chemical, the only thing that is not chemical is water.
Well, this episode confirms that this channel was just created as an excuse for Mat to eat and drink as much as he wanted with an "scientific" excuse. 🤪
So, I was super shocked at that result, I was sure Mat and Steph would have chosen diet coke, one question though: 1. How did you cleanse your palette between colas so there were no unintentional biases from the flavour of the cola before? 2. Also, would you do a follow up experiment of diet coke vs. harris-teeters but using the same container material source? i.e. in that case, it looks like it should be plastic bottle; just to confirm these results for Mat?
I havent drank coke since the end of February, :) you got this brooooooooooooooo
This is what happen when Coke doesn’t sponsor MatPat
There is a food lion all the way up in west Virginia
The story of an underdog
D
Super shocked Food Lion is still around. It died here. C for Coke on my name for soda
Where did the hood come from?
Soft drink here In Perth (Australia)
DC is the king. Can find it in most places in the world, even super remote locations and flavor consistency is unparalleled. I think they must hit a certain PH level or filtration standard at each bottler or something.  It does taste better from Fountain or Can and it should be properly aerated as it is very carbonated when first opened.  A&W root beer is best diet soda tbh but DC is the best go to option because of availability.
Publix isn't just "Also" in Florida. Publix is *from* Florida.  EDIT: Also I have actually heard of Food Lion because I used to vacation in Beech Mountain, North Carolina
Coke zero
he got tired of asking for a coke sponsorship and decided to do something about. Manipulative, i like it, diet coke pay the man
how
A: pop
Actually, Food Lion is big here in Virginia too. All the store brands are actually really good, and they are cost efficient. So we normally get the store brand.😁
Why isn't any store that Matpat showed in Germany
Europeans know pepsi max😌😌
:O      Oh he is just doing a blind test. :/ (Edit)        OHHHHHHHH HE CHOSE THE  UNDERDOG!!!! (Edit 2)
I can't believe you drink so much soda and survive remember  the dose is the poison
Here in the west, we call it soda. Also, the fact that you even showed a diet root beer makes me feel a gross taste on my tongue
Soda, and Pop ,and Coke is what I use.  My 1st Home State is Michigan ,but my 2nd Home State is Florida.  My 1st most visited Big City is Detroit ,and my 2nd most visited  Big City is New York .  My 1st most visited Capital City is Washington DC ,but my 2nd most visited   Capital City is  Toronto.
Soft Drink.
I’m a coke person myself
What's the difference between coke zero and diet coke? I'm not trying to start an argument I've just never had diet coke
I watched this drinking Dr pepper. Muahahah I'm such a rebel.
WOW!! You might want to look at the specific Harris Teeter bottle you purchased. Where it SPECIFICALLY was bottled can also have a unique mix vs another bottling plant making the “same” soda for the same brands. You might find that your favorite comes from only one specific bottler. It could honestly be a private plant that contracts for Kroger specific to that region only..
B: IT'S SODA.
Diet coke tastes like medicine. Its so bad
My ex best friend worked at Food Lion for YEARS. I'm from Oregon. I gladly know of Food Lion.
me : "can i get one cup of cold diet carbonized synthetic sweetener water here?"
Do a MnM theroy with TheOdd1sOut
The Krabby Patty secret ingredient is citric acid
Vanilla Coke is the best you cant argue otherwise
Funny enough in the Arab homeyard all soda is Pepsi -What kind of Pepsi do you want -7UP 🤣
Oh my god he's quitting diet coke
The only thing I got from this was you guys are bad at quartz parchment sheers.
im Australian soooooo D:SoftDrink
Today i learned what march madness meant. Seriously thanks. I was always curious but never bothered to google
Wait I live in sc and have food lion
I actually prefer coke zero over coke becouse it's roughly the same taste but coke is borderline undrinkably sweet for me
I Call it soda
C  EDIT:here in my country say coke
Do one where they are watered down by ice
d. Soft drink
I'm Pacific Northwest born and raised, here, and to me, it's always been 'soda'. My grandparents on my mom's side call it 'pop' and they grew up around Arizona. I don't bat an eye at someone referring to it as either 'coke' or 'pepsi' regionally though. It's just like a dialect shift across the country, like how certain words are pronounced. Same deal with the terminology.  Language is freaking fun sometimes <3
B-Soda
How can you be so scared for your health
here in australia we just call it soft drink
We say soda in Florida and Georgia I haven’t heard anyone call all soda coke
you’re a changed man Mat
c its all coke
I live in sweeden it's net here you will love   it here and I love fnaf so wen you make your fnaf theorys I get happy so wen you can and if you whod like come to sweeeden
What about non diet soda
Normal Cola is The best
Do an episode on store brands!  The Canadians have formed a cult around Presidents Choice.  My husband swears by it and says “mmmmmmm I can taste the store brand”
B: Soda
Isn't coca cola a substitute for toilet cleaner?
In my contry we cal it mb minuman bersoda
Tis soft drink. That’s what everyone I know calls it
Or you could just be a mad lad and drink Dr. Pepper like all us sane people. As it is by far the best soda, change my mind(or fight me).
D down here in SA Australia we say soft drink
As an employee of Kroger-owned Dillons in Kansas, I can neither confirm nor deny the quality of our diet soda. I have never been fond of any diet drinks. Real sugar all the way for me, thanks.
other : cold drink
I'll never understand cola. I like other sodas much more. I'm soda.
FIZZY DRINK!!!
its all coke. im from alabama
That was the best anime tournament arc end ever. Boko no hero, DBZ, take notes. Matt pat straight up smoked you writing wise without actual writing. What a world.
You do Rock/Paper/Scissors wrong!!  Btw what would call 2 separate scissors in your house? A pair of a pair of scissors???
Coke
3 things were proved in this video 1 don't judge a book by its cover  2 Steffeni (sorry i spelt it wrong) and Matpat have a TELEPATHIC connection!!! 3 Now Matpat is pretty much ran out of memes...
ive never understood the format of the ubiquitous "bracket" system. Why would you put the most likely to win up against the least likely to win in the first round? idk I'm not a sports guy, but in this context, it would make more sense if the placements were randomized and the identities were kept secret until the very end, to ensure an objective decision.
Harris teeter sales after this
WOW I was NOT expecting that!🤣🤣🤣😱😁🔥🔥🔥
In South Africa, every soft drink is coke... no exception
Cactus Cooler
I’m just waiting for Word Theory
I was only half-paying attention, but 3:45 made me pause and rewind to make sure I was just mishearing things.
Australia - We call all cola's coke
I am definitely a soda person
I just say läsk
This shocked me so much
Wait that Pat is quitting iconic Diet Coke
I love you guys so much!
this is not the real MatPat, the real one would never stop drinking diet, not even if his life was depending on it
what's up with the green screen at 8:09?
Give it all to me :>
Diet beverages give me severe headaches. Other than tap water, the most cost efficient beverage is coffee with cream. You get a low calorie stimulant with a dose of vitamin D.
I use to have a food lion by me and i live in florida
so thats my favorite diet as well
Is there Caffeine Free  regular (not Diet) Cocoa Cola ?
uhhhh what are the glitches? is this going to be another game you're going to put in foreseeable future or bad rendering?
soda
I am a D, I just call it a Fizzy Drink
finnaly  food theorist got an intro
13:32 i smell arg piece
Is it just me, or does diet Sprite taste like Coke LOL?
soda
We call colas koffeinhaltige Erfrischungsgetränke...
Watch him go back to Diet Coke in the next episode
Top 10 anime betrayls
In Germany the sweetened drinks are called Erfrischungsgetränke (Refreshing drink literally), while most germans tend to call every sweetened drink that is not made of fruit juice and soda/seltzer a lemonade.
how has matpat not done a kiki series on diet cola?
Soda, make poll
Fanta dont miss, at every vending machine, every can, every bottle expect a good regular taste of fanta.
Where’s the theory.
So is noone gona talk about a "glitch" at 8:07 and at 22:51?  I think another hunt/game coming up.
You're correct! Fred meyer in the nw!!
coke but i am not from the us
is there an Easter egg or something going on?
Soda. Because it's Soda POP. We're lazy southerners and leave off the back-half of the word. :D
Why weren’t they blinded with blindfolds
I know somebody who gets canned Diet Coke with Splenda instead of aspartame and I’m thinking of trying it. Dunno where to get it from tho. I’ll need to ask them
Boston soda
THIS IS THE WHITEST THING I HAVE SEEN ALL DAY...
CANADA DRY MY GUY ITS AWESOME
I call them soft drinks
What it’s glitching
Are they still doing like theory hunts because the hunters should check the description for a secret message
As a Georgian, it would be sacrilegious to say anything other than Coke
umm wow harris teeter good job
Harris teeter is what we all wish we could be  XD
Steph should run the fourth channel when it comes out
Plot Twist: The best soda is the 3rd supplier: Kroger. "Coke and Pepsi are the only ones." "No... There is another."
I CLICKED AS SOON AS I SAW THE TITLE
Diet Pepsi is good.
One reason all most of them were sweet was probably cause they werent cold if they were wow th a is some sweeeeeet coco cola lol
pop
Had to check if it was April fools day
now watch Pepsi contact you with a sponsorship
Yo matpat go with Dr Pepper I promise you it'll be the best chose of your life from a cleveland dude to another you gotta
Pop soda coke or other? I am other i call it perfect poison
wth does all this seeded things mean?!
I used to always say "pop," but when people started criticising me for it I started saying soda lol. I'm from Utah btw
diet sodas asemble
You would love Dr Pepper
soda
I have a sodastream and it makes decent sodas, definitely not as good as from the bottle.
Definitely heard of Food Lion, used to have a good number of them in Eastern Panhandle WV, though like 90% got closed the past few years
Jones Soda is awesome. I've always wanted to try their holiday special drinks, like turkey and gravy.
8:09 is there some ar thing happening right now?
The showdown is invalid right at the beginning.  you should compare apples to apples. Plastic bottles to  plastic bottles cans to cans. The Coca-Cola already has the advantage because it’s a fountain drink
Common store brands are often as good, or sometimes even better than many of the expensive name brand.
diet coke is bad for you. when they say no sugar is added and when u taste a diet coke and a normal coke, it tastes the same. Ever guess why? Because they added artificial sweeteners which is almost like poison for your body. Basically, it's worse than normal coke. So if u like coke, u would be better of just getting coke.
Imagine if Matt and Steph were 1 day away from Coke coming to their home to give them merchandising or something and then they posted this video. Joking aside, I love how Steph kinda knew to play rock every time. She knows Matt so well!
I'm sorry but I'm a total matpat for pepsi max and coke zero.
Pop
Sparkling water with a twist of lime
The nectar of the gods
I use the term soft drink
It scares me that Matt knew EXACTLY which one was which at the beginning.....but unfortunately it didn't surprise me he knew 😁 hehehe
Faygo  Made in Detroit Michigan .
Pineapple Pepsi is better than regular Pepsi prove me wrong
12:33 im a mix between pop and coke  sometimes we call it soda pop because... kids  and we call it coke cause its a restaurant and its "Fancy-er" that way
The Food Theory tournament arc is finally here
In Australia, we call it Soft Drink/Fizzy Drink. If you say Soda, everyone will be like “we ain’t  dumb Americans, it’s called Soft Drink” and if you say Pop, they won’t know wtf you’re taking about. And Coke is just coke
Wait you did WHAT?
Soft Drink
I can’t help but think that including “fountain Diet Coke” because it was objectively the best Diet Coke was not the right way to conduct the experiment. I would think that the most readily available product should be put in the mix as that was the criteria for the rest of the products.
Interesting. Living in Florida now, I discovered Winn-Dixie's soda brand "Chek" made a diet cola  just as good as Diet Coke. Chek is made by Polar; I couldn't find who makes Harris Teeter's sodas.
C
D läsk
Does anybody realize there were three in the beginning they figured out which ones were can and fountain but still stared at the bottle on
I know it's not sold widely, but Moxie is an excellent "cola."(in that it is technically a cola, but is raddically different in flavour.) And even has a diet varient. If only it were more widely available...
i say soft drink also i drink coffee
I thought Dr Pepper was cola flavored
I am a big fan of the kroger brand BigK sodas.. tehy are half the price of name brand and imo taste better, so hearing that you have chosen a Kroger label soda dosnt surprise me
diet coke tastes weird
Coke. There is nothing else. Pop is your Dad, and Soda is carbonated water.
Diet Coke is doouwg
considering im not american,the only ones i would even get the chance to try is pepsi or coke
I’m not gonna lie. This is better than actual March madness, especially since I’ve known about matpats obsession for a LONG time
Soda
🤎
Other in Australia: 'Soft Drink'
Setting up all those bottled sodas up against fountain pop is totally unfair! Fountain soft drinks ALL taste better than canned or bottled! Interesting results, though!
Shame that Kofola sells only in Czech republic, Poland and Slovakia
That’s why 2020 was so bad Matpat didn’t drink diet coke
I was gonna sigest cherry coke then u said not any flavored colas
soda or sodapop on the west coast.
Im a "B" man btw
Pepsi Lite is the best we get there were in from in Australia it's No.1
My family (in australia) call it fizzy drink
so harris teeter is just coke lemonade ??
Diet Pepsi has a lot of carbonation
Wish it was a blind taste test the whole way with knowing what the sodas were at the end.  Would have made for a dramatic finish.  Even the seeding should have been kept from you.
Haven't started the vid but i know this is a lie
You live in North Carolina?
As a grocery store employee I can confirm we actually often get items labeled for other stores and though they're all sibling companies we can't actually sell the product at all
Could you do a video where you find out which soda and diet is the healthiest? Also, a video on whether or not diet soda is healthier than regular soda?
as a canadian i find pop and soda are used pretty widely - if i went into a restaurant and asked for a coke expecting Fanta, i’d be surely disappointed
wow i just wasted 24 minutes hoping i would watch something great like usual from this channel  but guess what i just watched two unproffessional coke taste testers just drink coke for 24 mintues straight and trying really hard to make it sound like it has big difference in taste  like dude COKE IS COKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pop… because Canada
This man said "7th seed" 3 times XD
I live in Australia so I say soft drinks or soda but I know what pop is
Worst breakup of 2021.
Catpat was forgotten Rip 😔
My fav is coke zero
You both have the best teath
I call it soda, like a normal person
I say soda I'm Australian
Great episode. So Matt's eastern seaboard favorite is Harris Teeter and when Matpat is everywhere else it's duet coke. :)
Come on MatPat, you needed a pallet cleanser before you took a sip of each of the different soda products. I have a suspicion that you will go back to diet coke, if you repeat this experiment with a pallet cleanser. Just a thought.
lotsa arg glitches there, calm the heck down on them, im worried about my eyesight now
Hold on...Food4Less is owned by KROGER?!?!?!??! Now wonder when my gal gets ingredients from Food4Less it reminds me of home...also FRY'S ELECTRONICS?!?!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?
Seven up free, mini can, is my drink of choice.
Wait so im the weird one calling it fizzly bubbly sugary water?
13:29 weird graphic glitch or is the gametheory arg still going?
pepsi
D: Here in Australia it's Soft Drink
NOOOO, DIET COKE IS PART OF THE BRAND!!!
I live in new york state, where the southern part calls it soda and the western part calls it pop. There have been heated arguments so now I try to avoid using either word if I dont know where in new york the other person is from
THIS CAN NOT BE!!!!!
AHHHHH noooooo.... I had hopes at first this was going to have good scientifically based explanations of why ANY diet drinks are bad (hint: artificial sweeteners trick your brain really badly), but he's actually just going through all of the different diet drinks to find the best one for him. He's actually doing the opposite, ingesting every single possible artificial sweetener mankind has found to introduce to flavored carbonated water. Oh, this is going to be a hard episode to watch. Maybe I'll go finish The Queen's Gambit instead.
That 6 way tie on the rock paper scissors was such a cute moment! Cute matpat / stephpat moment to think so similarly :3
i am nowhere near any of these places that sell that diet coke...
Here in Scotland its called juice
as someone who works at frys (kroger owned), we do sell big k diet cola
I’ve been watching this channel since 2015 and when I saw the title my mind exploded.
watch that brand become a juggernaut
The Boyland’s Root Beer is one of my faves but I haven’t tried that
2021 is officially weird than 2020 since MatPat quit Diet Coke
We just called it Soda
NOOOOOOOO AHHHHHHHHH WHYYYYY THE WORLD IS ENDDING AHHHHHHHHHHH
Here in Australia they're called soft drinks. I don't know why though lol (pop is also just plain wrong)
Soda, pop, coke, or other. I’m other, I grew up calling soda “Fizzy drink” (Yes I am Australian)
My mom had drank nothing but diet coke and coke zero and she died of esophageal cancer so I hope you find a new obsession. I know that is just my mother's experience and everyone has a different experience but I am just warning everyone.
anyone isolate and analyze those graphical glitches happening in this vid yet?
Soda pog
Fizzy
Lol I’m from the Midwest and say soda
15:31 I am nothing, I do not like any carbonated drink EXCEPT for Fanta grape
As a Boylan fan (their cream soda is my favorite) I was a little sad their diet (which I never tried) was that bad
well you are drinking diet. no real surgar cane for those "original sodas"
I'm glad to see coke zero on here I am diabetic and I love seeing this
D: Other, I use soda and pop interchangeably.  Also, new ARG?
Aldi diet coke is better than named brand
He's turned to the dark side
Please please watch 13:20 at .25 speed 😂😂
Here's a food theory for ya matt: Diet coke is worse then regular coke (Health Wise)
im defo a D i always called it fizzy or fizzy drink in NZ after a game of rugby.
We call it fizzy in NZ
Not a Diet drink, but I gotta say, if you have a Publix near you, check their 'Multicultural Foods' or International Food aisle, on the bottom shelves, for a golden nectar labled 'Inca Kola'  Discovered it at Disney world, has a slightly bubble-gum-y taste, and is by far my favorite lesser-known soda of all time!
Most people in the comments like “i like that one” and “i know that one” when I’m sitting here being like anyone see that that was a glitch like the old hunt
He who controls the CITRUS, controls the WORLD!
Harris tetter is like ultrainstinct  shaggy vs goku
Get into craft soda
My town is a C:Coke town. We always just say 'I would like a Coke' and then specify what coke we want
You Americans are weird... Diet Coke tastes like a chemical bath... Pepsi Max for the win... not that you have that in the US..
Dang, I thought he still live in Los angeles in California
Pepsi still the best
in the philippines we call it softdrinks, we have local brands which we use as common nouns like sparkle or rc
Florida gang
Who even drinks diet coke
I have heard of food lion (or at least have seen the logo) but I Romania it's called Mege Image
My dad calls u the Bing guy
I grew up calling it soft drinks or soda
Yay I feel justified having 4 2 Liter bottles of Coke Zero in my fridge now
Nooo get back the diet coke
MatPat: This Harris Teeter soda is good Kroger: Noted
The elderly plaster optically manage because dibble terminally disarm under a agreeable train. bored, enchanting blowgun
I have a question as a non soda drinker...why do people insist on drinking soda regularly at all? My family didn't have a lot of $$ growing up so you drank either milk or water. We were only allowed pop if we were eating out  & even then the parents gave us the "must you?" look. Soda, diet or not is bad for you! I do have it occasionally just for something different but I'll never understand the need for families to always have soda in the fridge. Why do you need a replacement if you haven't had it for a year?
In my country wich is denmark we call i sodavand we just call it soda water 😂😂
D: deep south, cold drink
Me look at the tumpnial :nooooo don't give up   Matpat:i am just replace the diet coke  Me:OoHO ok good for u good for u😂😂
The spurious cyclone ethnically clear because chicory inherently poke an a exultant korean. macabre, unruly toothbrush
We’re all “c. coke” here up in India
I can't drink soda because the carbonation makes me sick, but this is a really interesting video and I loved it.
You did a runoff of diet coke and didn't include the original glass bottle which is by far the best!? The glass bottle version hasn't come into contact with any source that it could absorb flavors from (Aluminum can, Plastic bottle, Paper fountain cup/ice/uneven syrup distribution) making it objectively the most pure version of the drink.
Why has 'theory' in all channels changed to 'theorists' ???
Gallons on a hourly basis?
March Matness is actually what people call the NCAA wresting tournament, but since Im a big theory fan I will let it slide lol
My favorites are cherry Dr Pepper, ginger ale, and cherry sprite
I grew up in new mexico. Ive always called it coke
Mat pat here me out cherry coke very is so good  no more commet
Diet soda is so bad for your teeth. The artificial sweeteners used are a lot more acidic
Answer why Trix are for kids Matpat?
your persona video is a complete and utter joke  for context: Matpat thought Teddie is Yu's shadow, he isn't Yu gained Orpheus through his contract with Igor and the Velvet Room
in england we say fizzy drinks/cold drink
There's some odd glitching effect at 13:31. I'm not sure if this was purposeful or not. It's very possible that it might not be, but I thought I might as well point it out.
mat once convinced me to try diet coke and it was the one of worst soda experiences I've had
I feel as though this channel is stock piling evidence for a citric acid theory down the line
Why does the background light at the end looks like Minecraft 4K with shadders
Shoulda been totally blind tasting. Instead of knowing the names of both theyre tasting
15:30 I have always called it pop
I only deal in absolutes, i say soda pop
Fizz water
ITS POP ... atleast here in ohio it is
Chicagoan here. We call it pop.
To be a fair blind taste test, you shouldn't know what in front of you is being compaired. Especially if you have a previous bias.
Kvass is tha best
Kroger/Harris Teeter: BUSINESS IS BOOMIN!!
In Australia we call it soft drink
Pepsi Ginger made me Quit the DC... but.. its gone now :)
I was really disappointed when I saw Diet Coke in your videos. It Tastes bad. It’s dangerous. It’s fake and artificial. And I’m happy more people are learning about this sweeteners danger
From Wisconsin. its Soda Here
I grew up in southern Ontario, in Canada. We call it Pop.
soda
C
I call it soft drink
I am from Oklahoma, I say soda and it is most commonly referred to as soda. However it is worth noting that one of the most well known soda specialty shops is called Pops and it is in Arcadia, OK if I recall. Ofcourse the name is technically soda POPS so soda is still in the name but POPS is in all caps and is the word that takes up the most space.
I just call it drink
Here in New Jersey we use soda. However some will just say Coke when ordering at a restaurant.
13:31 glitch?
Who's gonna break it to him about Frys?
Normal cocacola is best
I've been in Colorado for most of life. We use Soda most often, occasionally you hear pop, and soft drinks definitely gets thrown around.
The famous utah pronunciation: sodypop
D. I live in south africa soo we all called it Gas-Cooldrink
Thai people call it coke
Food theory slowly turning into good mythical morning
The HEB texas one is pretty good actually, although i prefer their Dr. Pepper version, pretty good
Wait  THATS ILLEGAL
I call them soft drink when speaking English, which isn't my native language. In my native language (Finnish) I call them limsa.
Oh no is this theory apocalypse.
I'm a soda man. As matt says, everywhere in the midwest says pop... except in the boundaries of Chicago proper.
Around here we say "Soda." If you ask for a coke you're getting a red can of coco-cola.
I grew up in Connecticut currently live in NC and I call it soda.  My husband born and raised NC and calls it soda.
I’ve moved around a lot and I ended up saying soda pop. Best of both worlds lol
Little over a decade ago when I was a little bitty 18 year old I worked at a Harris Teeter. Missed a great opportunity to try their soda :(
BRUUH YOU NEED THE RED MTN DEW
Thumbs Up indian cola
Guess I'm going to Pay Less tomorrow
Regular Coke. Done.
15:29 D. Other  I mostly hear the people in my country call all of those "Soft drinks"
Lol,as a brazilian i can say,our diet coke keep the taste of a normal coke and still zero sugar 😄👍
Kroger's closest market is 124 miles away
whoever in the thumbnail got a nice cut
Try Rio Cola it is the best cola drink in Finland(we dont have diet coce)
Diet Coke Employees: Sir, we lost MatPat. Diet Coke Boss: Dam it! Send a sponsorship, now! We need him to stay addicted.
Maybe it's because I haven't watched the entire video but you can't judge taste by straw
I recommend water
D: in aus we say lemonade or soft drink or the name of the drink
tab cola. that’s it.
Me: *sips Diet Coke*  Me: "Traitor"

“There will be no fruity flavored soda in the competition”   > a fruity flavored soda wins

Me who's allergic to citrus

as someone who knows jackshit about sports but watches GMM every 3am: "i am somewhat of a march madness expert myself"
Does diet coke make you gain weight ?
Welp... I never thought I would see the place where I work in a Theorist video...
7:13 excuse me, soda speciality shop??? Like a whole shop dedicated to soft drinks?! What other things do they have in America?
I live in Australia we call them soft drinks or by their brand name
Diet soda is bad for teeth. Also you get higher risk of getting diabetes. And personal opinion diet sodas has less taste.
I grew up with soft drink or fizzy drink. Joys of down under
In my country there is Pepsi zero with vanilla and cherries
Diet shasta is always garbage
UHHHHHH myself and 20 odd million other Australians are FIZZY
6:11 - Matt, Steph is right. As a Floridian I can confirm that Florida is its own thing. We are not a part of the south east. We’re somehow south of that in a weird Florida Man Bermuda Triangle situation. Steph knows it.
Matpat quitting diet coke. Talk about the ultimate clickbait title.
This is proof that the world is coming to an end
Mat: *2 is the best*  Me and Steph: **Surprised Pikachu Face**

'The fall, of the beverage'
Most people coke and soda  Me : drinks?...
As a life long Pepsi drinker. I can appreciate the work put into this. I may have to do the same type of thing but not diet. (at least not for me) In hopes to find the best POP in my area.
Tbh I am not surprised that I did not know 3/4 of the sodas here cause im in Singapore
Giving undertale to the pope
I like diet soda better than normal soda cuz I prefer the taste of the sweetener. I’m not much of a fan of like, sucrose sugar in beverages. I’m more of a Sprite lad, tho.
I've lived in South Georgia my entire life and I have never heard someone call all sodas Coke. we just call it soda
Plot twist:Pepsi is Diet coke in disquise
Bone apple tea
LOOOOOONG time diet soda (that's right soda, not Coke despite hailing from Georgia) I can confirm that Kroger's brand Big K Cola is among my favorite soda in existence. Also notable is Winn-Dixie/Piggly Wiggly brand Check Cola is pretty phenomenal. I would highly recommend giving those a try as well.
Water. Just drink water
Alright kids! Today we're going to do something called 'questioning your identity'!
In the Philippines, we call all carbonated drinks as "Softdrinks"
Not possible
I can already tell you before I watch this episode Coke Zero is the superior diet soda.
honestly, i cant say im too surprised that two grocery store brands have made it pretty far. i personally have had a fantastic experience with store brands in nc, oddly enough i recently realized i like great value frosting more than some of the more fancy stuff, so i cant say im too surprised at the quality. solid stuff tbh. also stevia is absolutely nasty
Diet fanta is the best
I need a EP of why Fountain soda always taste better
diet coke is the perfect fit to replace your old obsession
Mat: "And they all DUKE it out" Every Duke Fan in 50 Miles: "WHAT IS THIS PAIN I FEEL?!"  Edit: Also, am I the only one surprised with the fact that Grocery Lion is a North Carolina exclusive? I really thought that was everywhere... Whelp, guess that tells y'all where I'm from.
Crystal Pepsi is back thanks to LA Beast.. MatPat... Shame...
i go by drink ._. llo

Hey matpat I have a question will the fnaf jackets be coming back if so when I really want one :),
Who allowed this to happen because I certainly did not!!!!!
big K dr k kroger is the best~!
Matpat what about the filipino drink rc it's very popular in the philippines
B: SODA
I just hope there’s an Australian version of Harris teeter diet cola
So whats the best soda/pop/cola/tonic to go with ice cream?
I stopped drinking coke because of their racist and extremist comments. My integrity is more important than my obsession with coca cola. And if you must know about my obsession with it, I own a wide amount of coke products such as their hotdog toaster, model cars, jacket, and its to the point that my co-workers noticed when I didnt ware my coke jacket for a single day. To them my identity WAS coke and coca-cola products so to see me without it they actually had a somewhat intervention on if I was feeling okay which honestly I was confused because I never noticed that I wore it so much. But as stated my integrity as an American and patriot means more to me than coke or coke products which i have been collecting since I was young. I just cant support a company that would willingly make racist remarks and try to demonize American citizens and even went out to say they don't even care about American buyers that they make enough money outside the country to stay in business. Even if it was true they shouldn't try to undermine the American market system.
I'm an attack helicopter
Good mythical morning be like:
When your husband loves Diet Coke more than you
My new favorite is zero sugar Dr pepper/cream soda!
It’s all coke not up for debate
who calls them all _coke??_ ive grown up in nc myself- i always learned to call it soda. granted, im younger (gen z, minor), so i mightve grown up with slightly different mentors in my life but- w h a -
An addition to my previous comment that I didn't want to get lost: soda in cans seem to have more carbonation than those in bottles. This affects not only the taste, but the entire drinking experience itself. Individuals may have carbonation level preferences. Source: I've drank a heckuva lot of diet soda in my lifetime.
“You’ve probably never heard of Food Lion.” *lives 5 mins from a food Lion* 😬
I personally don’t drink Diet soda however one thing I can say coke from Mexico is pretty hecken good also I actually have a frys here where I live they have really good doctor pepper
Almost 10 minutes in and 3 glichy effects, is there another arg happening???
Now that MatPat has crowned a new diet cola king Coca-Cola is gonna roll up with his long awaited sponsorship LOL
Always heard "soda" and I'm from SC
A
Pop
I live in Canada so ppop
A lot of the older people here where I live in Texas call soda "soda water" but mostly everyone I know calls it just "soda"
I’m surprised he’s all about diet cookie and not regular coke...should do a theory on artificial sweeteners and how diet sodas are worse
Now we're not gonna hear any diet coke jokes anymore
13:29 Anyone else see that or is my device just buggy? Is MatPat gearing up for a new theorist challenge or am I just paranoid?
WTH do both of u look likes twins......this shiz is weird
Of all the insane Food Theory episodes, this one tales the cup.
D: other we call it cooldrink
Well I call it a SODIE 🤣
Dialect things: I’m in the Midwest so everybody around me calls it pop, but being bilingual Japanese-American, I call it “Soda” because that’s what they call it in Japan
I live in the midwest but for some reason I say both pop and soda
This low-key feels like a shounen anime plot to me. Like this unknown soda brand ended up going against the most popular diet soda brand
I'm equally addicted to orange juice
Matt, you do realize Pepsi is also North Carolina made? (in referring 14:50)
Uhhh did anyone else see that green flash on screen or was it just me
O.    O     O
13:30 - 13:32 Weird cut with the signal lost effect. "What does it mean?"-double rainbow guy
crap he put a glitch thing at 1331 exactly
I really like Theory episodes with Steph in them. Matt’s great on his own but his chemistry with Steph is just really fun to watch. Low key wanna start a petition to get more of Stephanie on the other theory channels...
I have an idea:  no soda.  Cut out soda.  You, your teeth, your throat, your stomach/gut, your family will thank you
What you dont know: he its sponsord
I tried to like diet soda, but couldn’t get past the after taste. I say both soda and pop, and sometimes soda pop. Citric acid is awesome. I bought a bag to make homemade sour patch kids and I add it to all kinds of things, It’s great sprinkled on jam. Just be very sparing, or it’s too strong.
How is Harris not disqualified!? it clearly has a flavor twist which it didn't disclose in it's branding. Diet Coke was robbed!
B
im thirsty and watching this doesnt help at all
If you really live in North Carolina, do you know what Cheerwine is. It’s a local cheery based soft drink (or soda, and no it’s not alcoholic) that was created in North Carolina. I’m not sure if it’s a statewide thing or a more local thing.
Imposable
Its obvious MatPat has been abducted by aliens XD
Wait is Baker’s not a national chain? They’re everywhere in Nebraska
Coke Zero > Diet Coke
tere is a 25 cent cola in my country, it has the flavour of sand and disease
The title: I quit Diet Coke. Me: WHAT?!?! NO WAY....
Of course its Kroger, GMM could have told you, Kroger brings it.
Ngl, this is one episode I wish I was a part of. I wanna taste some different sodas dangit.  Edit: @15:29 D: Other, specifically "Soft Drink".
Harris Teeter pulled an Anime MC move lol
Over here in kiwi land (new zealand), we all know it as just fizzy or fizzy drink. Edit: also soft drinks. It switches between the two
I believe that you totally invalidated your whole comparison test. By choosing Diet Coke from a fountain, you are drinking something that is not exactly replicated regularly. A fountain soda (yes, SODA; pop is your dad) comes to the food service location as syrup. It is mixed in a soda tower, set up by people. This in and of itself can lead to slight unintentional imperfections in the mix. For example, how firmly the tube is connected to the nozzle in the syrup box can affect exactly how much syrup is dispensed for each serving. Before it is mixed with the carbonation, the water flows up through tubes which are cooled by the ice towers. The amount of cooling affects the amount of carbonation. Even the pressure on the lever which is pressed by the server can affect the overall outcome of the mix. There are just too many variables for a fountain drink to be used in a comparison test. (Disclaimer: I really do not know if there are multiple ways different soda towers work. However, drinking diet colas pretty much my whole life has made me very aware that a cup of soda from one location can taste totally differently from a cup of soda from another)  Besides. Coke Zero is the clear winner in a taste test challenge!  😉
Mat pat running out of ideas . Doing stupid and boring stuff
I drink enough Mt Dew that in theory I should be green, or at least peeing green. I shouldn't confess that, but I am heavy caffeine drinker and my foolish mind craves it. But I have been cutting down lately, I've somewhat replaced it by coffee, something probably just a little more healthy. Still if your like me and your body craves insane amounts of caffeine.. switching isn't easy.
Did y’all or anyone call soda fizzy drink

We need a Greg Doucette - Food Theory collab
Matpat, if you want good boylan soda. Get the one with calories, TRUST ME
I say cola
D: I actually used to call it soda pop
I’m from the south but I would say where I am 70% say soda and 30% say coke.
Coke
harris teeter is probably currently experiencing all time high stonks right now
But where did the fountain DC come from? Gas station fountain taste different from say Burger King. And BK taste different from McDonalds. Every place taste different depending on how the syrup and CO2 is mixed.
conclusion coke>pepsi
What does Coke taste like? I never drank it, or Coke Zero, or Diet Coke, or Pepsi, or DrPepper.
This channel was probably based off of the idea of this video
Who else is waiting for the 4th channel { conspiracy theories }
I'm from Canada so most of us call it Pop but growing up in a Filipino household my parents referred to it as "soft drinks" I occasionally say carbonated drinks ever since I stopped drinking them all together  basically I'm a mixed bag
i call it either "soft drink" or "fizzy drink" or whatever the things name is i guess
Harris Teeter/Kroger Food Theory episode????
Grew up saying pop until someone in a taco bell in texas punched me, called it coke or soda ever since.
Wow Matt’s the only famous person living in North Carolina and the richest person who doesn’t grow tobacco in the state!
Sometimes Coke, sometimes soda. I'll also use Fizzy Drinks and Bubble Drinks.
IT WAS SAID YOU WOULD LOVE AND DRINK THE DIET COKE NOT LEAVE IT. YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE MATTHEW
B
Breaking news! Coke to change Diet Coke recipe as their biggest sponsor drops out!
I want to point out that's HT cola zero, not diet cola. I also think you screwed up big time by mixing bottle, can, and fountain. Fountain is so uncontrolled!! I'm gonna check Kroger Zero tomorrow 😉👉
I love Zevia!! I hope it wins~ Edit: I feel you. Stevia isn’t for everyone.
Is anyone else ready for a March matness 2022?
Tfw Diet Coke should have promoted MatPat while they had the chance
(Die)t Coke.   Very interesting.
I'm gonna start calling it "fizzy" to make people mad.
I used to call it pop but sometime during highschool I started calling it soda because of one of my friends from California.
Around 13:30, even the video couldn't really withstand Mat's extreme euphoria getting to drink diet coke xD
This was borderline good mythical morning.
I call everything cherry coke. It's not a dialect, or a joke, I just dont drink anything else
I can't believe that matpat intentionally ignored diet carbonated milk. he knew what he had done
As a North Carolinian this was extra entertaining
wait till we get a theory about is matpat vegan
weird blip at 13:31
I've been drinking classic coke since I was a kid bit switched over to coke zero  when it came on the market. Never could stomach diet colas as they have a horrible aftertaste and aren't as sweet. Coke zero is pretty close to the original. I'm not surprised you wouldn't pick it. A diet coke drinker wouldn't like the full flavor of a regular coke.  BTW, as an avid fan of coke since childhood and the fact that I really can't stand Pepsi it was good to see them get knocked out.
cocaine
Everywhere I go to eat always has either standard Coke or Pepsi, so I usually just say Coke, and if they ask if Pepsi's okay, I just say yes. But if I want something else, I'll just call it by name.  Generally my family always just calls it soda anyway.
Diet soda is very VERY bad for you
So much character development in one episode! New favourite anime.
D: Give me a pepsi
not pop, not coke, not soda, but "yummy nummy sugary drinks with caffeine and good flavor" we go to the bar and my lil cousin says "can i have one yummy nummy sugary drink please?" its adorable
In the uk we call it fizzy drinks
Pop
Soda
I haven't heard the name food lion in so long you just brought a flood of memories thinks Mat😢
harris teeter made this the best anime battle ever.
We call them bebsi Just like pepsi but with an “b” instead of “p”
I drink basically nothing but real Coca-Cola, could never stand Diet Coke's taste. No really, I mainly just drink regular Coke.
This is game changing y’all
Impossible
I am a Coke Zero for life gal
I’d love to see a food theory on what’s really the difference between all the sugars such as stevia vs pure cane sugar etc and which really is healthier or is it all just market games
Pepsi Max cherry is the best soda
Become Dr pepper
Matt: ranting about diet coke Steff: 🧍
I am from Oklahoma and I say coke for all sodas and soda if I have to be more specific than the word coke
Is there a hidden Easter egg in this video cause there's something at 13:31 of the video
12:09 matpat talks about hating the 365 cola like a british person
I work at foodlion lol
B/c
Welcome to the South, MatPat. The secret ingredient to everything down here is sweet tea and biscuits & gravy.
In Australia we call it soft drink
We call it soft drink/fizzy drink where I live
No no no. How have people not heard of FOODLION
Us here in Utah are generally Soda people. Soda fountain, Diet Soda, etc.
Water's good
Maybe Harris Teter will also go where diet coke never did. A sponsorship XD
nice clickbait
In australia, i've only predominantly heard "soda" be called "Soft drink". It's what I call it, and its what everyone i know calls it.
The secret of krabby patties is that is has citric acid in it
My favourite is coke 0
oh so he is leaving his addiction  Mattpatt: this is a chance to *replace* Diet Coke  Never mind.
Harris teeter needs to sponser :)
Imma soft drink kid
I moved out here to the West from VA where I had Food Lion right down the road from me to now, Fry's (and sometimes safeway). By far, I have had the best experience with Fry's and Safeway branded items. Safeway has really good coffee creamer and frozen pizzas while Fry's has everything else good and cheap. It was nice to hear that Kroger owned them in case I ever moved back since the main Kroger branded stores have started to spread around the south.
Ummmmmmm Pepsi should never have been on this
I actually have a similar addiction, only it's with sprite zero
Why was that harris teeter look exactly like the one near me...
I want that coke with cane in it
Stevia is a great sweetener, I use Truvia to sweeten drinks all the time and sometimes eat it like sugar off a spoon.  So it can be a good drink sweetener (I think Coca-Cola Life actually uses it) but Zevia just has a garbage recipe. it's the only soda I've ever bought a six pack to try, tasted a single sip of, and immediately dumped out all of it and threw away the rest.  I drink 1-2 liters of diet cola a day, and I've tried a lot of different types of diet drinks. Zevia is by far the worst tasting soda I've ever tried. Stevia sweeteners are great though, depending on how they are processed.
I’m a pop
When I was a kid, mostly used the term pop drinks. When I got older, especially around high school, started saying "soda" or "soft drinks".
anyone else looking for coke a cola’s comment?
B. Soda
wtf happened at 8:10?
After all this time I’m surprised he hasn’t been sponsored by coke yet
Steph and Matt are doing the the hard work so we don't have too
Just stop drinking soda.
LET'S GO HARRIS TEETER WAOH
Me who just look at the thumbnail: woah woah woah is he having a crisis?
**Me sees title** Me: impossible!!!
This is illegal! Mat-pat quitting Diet Coke!?
2:55 me looking at my can of diet Dr. Pepper.
3:03 video glitch 4:06 another one 8:09 woahh 9:42 :/ 13:30 Bruh 22:52 hurB
Chose Fountain over Can? Welp you automatically lost your own tourney, well done lel.
coke
I find this so funny because in the Coke vs Pepsi debate, I will ALWAYS pick Pepsi because it contains citric acid as well 😂 I find it to also be more carbonated and a bit lighter on the tongue and Coke does something weird when it gets warm and flat that just grosses me out.
Here in Ohio we say pop
diet coke sucks
Impossible
I mean cmon be honest diet coke is like his second wife
Coke for me lol
In this episode we watch an addict fall off the wagon.
As soon as I heard Boylan I winced xD I used to work at a retro themed diner and we sold several flavours, some weren't bad but some were very.....pungent.
When MatPat started food theory I figured a video like this would happen sooner or later
I work for QFC and can say with reasonable certainty that the Harris Teeter diet cola is basically the same as Big K, with slight variations in its flavor. someone like MatPat likely could pick up on it but the differences should be minor enough that you can still enjoy what he's enjoying
13:30 - 13:32
Citric acid might be the secret ingredient in the krabby patty
Citric acid we love you
Diet Cherry Coke
Citric acid is the missing Krabby Paddy ingredient
Id recomend ordering twigs im not sure if their diets 0 calories but their wide varieties of flavors including cola , flavor , price, and swagger makes it my favorite
C: Coke
This isn’t food theory it’s actually RANDOM FOOD THINGS AND MAT PATS WIFE IN EVERY EPISODE

Oow I got it matpat
Oh! Kroger! I recognized that brand name immediately! Here in Colorado, King Soopers (probably the overall cheapest and best grocery store chain in the state) is the store that sells Kroger products. I don't drink soda very much, but I guess that if I were to give them a spin, the generic brand it is! The lesson of this episode? The generic brands can actually be great! (Something that I've believed for a very long time, but whatever.)  Also fun fact. I took a trip from my home state of Colorado to Utah. We needed to pick up some food and so popped into a grocery store. The store turned out to be another one under the Kroger umbrella. And hey! Our membership discount coupon whatever cards still worked over there! So if you have a card for one of these Kroger chains, maybe they can work at every Kroger store! I'd actually really like to test this to see if it's true.
We call it sweet drink where I’m from
as a fellow coca cola enthusiast, Canned, bottled, and drink fountain cola are indeed distinctly different, i don't know how or why, but its just true.
There are few things that can predict the end of the world, Matpat quitting Diet Coke is #1
Very interesting. Mariano's is my local supermarket. Might just have to try their generic Cola one day now. On any other day of the week.. fountain Anything, wins hands down. Great episode of POP there. ;)
Soda
So my family wants to know why im yelling 'Harris Teeter' in the next room
Hey, North Carolina ain't too far from where I live.
Here in australia we call it fizzy drink :)
Why diet.... the artificial sweeters they use all have a funky twang after taste
I love to drink vanilla coke
this is so sad
MatPat doing a GMM soda tap vs bottle vs can taste test
I gotta say Kroger’s Private Select product line has always surprised me with their overall quality.  Pretty sure they even have a Private Select line of Pop as well, below their standard store brand pops as well. I’m partially curious which Harris Teeter used, but I’d bet on the standard.  Matt & Steph seem to have a taste for the more simple and basic Diet Colas.  And can we take a moment to appreciate how well marketed Coke is that the South has replaced Pop with name brand word association; one of the more subtle threats to this nation's free trade. It gives the larger, well-known companies an unfair advantage.
Top 10 anime betrayals
i like coke zero suger
coke no sugar
If you can try the zevia root beer it's so good
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH this is fake right
Cali were it at
Video Glitch around 8:10
15:29 well. Pick your poison
Let's goo NC!!!!
I work for food lion distribution center in green castle pa! I’m jazzed that my fav grocery chain made it through so far!!!
We call it cold drink......  Yes, cold drinks
Why are none of Kroger's brands in the Midwest!?
Matpat: **Loves Diet Coke** The entire internet: **Everyone liked that**
We call it soft drinks haha. Soda and pop just doesn’t have the same vibe ya know.
At my King Soopers (a Kroger store) my favorite go is Kroger's "Fizz & Co" label/brand of soda flavored seltzer waters. Zero sweetener, just the taste of soda. Cola, "Dr Flavor", and Root Beer.
Coke
Lol what is this episode? Out of ideas list #1 . opinion about soda . do it!
Virgils Cherry Vanilla Nails it every time.
Dr pepper
Try diet dr.pepper.
Food Lion is the MOST popular store in all of Delaware so I very surprised when i heard “North Carolina” based  Honestly thought only Delaware and PA had them lol
I miss Publix
I used to be pop but I’m moving down south and have been trying to say soda
In the first minute of the video I was craved enough to go get a coke of some sort
Is fountain fair though?  1) it's inconsistent  2) are you going to a fast food outlet every time you want a diet coke in the future?
B
Try Olipop
Whats the glitch in 13:30?
Soda and Coke down here in the southwest
This was a wonderful video.
I didnt know they had Food Lion in America at all, growing up in Romania we knew of Food Lion ( It was called MEGA IMAGE ) So to see it here was kinda shocking
I would like to point something out. It's so often said "it's fRoM tHe saMe FaCtOrY" like that means it's the same product. Those factories follow the recipes you give them.  They are bound by contract to keep those recipes proprietary. They make one product, then switch to another. They don't just switch labels. Think about the products that leave your kitchen. The recipe/ingredients dictate far more than the location, right?
I know that MatPat will not completely stop drinking Diet Coke but his final choice still shook me
Mat I tried every single diet coke at Fred Meyer and it is is the same thing that u guys describe it to be
plot twist: he still loves diet coke also that's a ton of soda's to drink I'm not judging I'm just overwhelmed when I just saw it at first I was like: whoa...….. :O that's a lot of soda's, also thought my laptop was broken it was just the camera I thought it was broken because the video has the sometimes error like green screen/background from fnaf 3 now it just gives me fnaf vibes again. also LOVED the video great video like every other vid.
impossible
Other, down here in Australia we call it fizzy
I'm glad that the word "diet" was in there when they were raising their straws, because "let the coke off begin" would have been very... Misleading
i like zevia its my personal favorite
Diet coke is forever.
I love Steph so much. Episodes she's in are almost always my favorite.
In Canada everybody I know calls it pop
never thought he’d do it
Im a soda guy
4:06 did anyone else see that
What if you put some extra citric acid into diet coke?
When I saw this I was like this guy isn't matpat
I live in Alabama, it's always soda. Usually at a restaurant they'd just ask you what you want to drink (and often the answer is "sweet tea" anyway)
My favorite drink is LifeAID or FitAID its healthy and good.
in Australia we say soft drink
Drink pepsi then B)
we call em softdrinks in the philippines
Water.
Pop and only pop
D: Flavoured Carbonated H2O
Here in down under land (Australia), it's interchangeable between soda and soft drink. though I hear soft drink more often than soda.
_on this episode of my strange addictions,_            *this man gave up his addiction.*
I like this channel
Wait, I thought he lived in California?
In india we call every soda " Sprite " which it self is a brand
Soda because I'm not a disgusting person
Pepsi: 😏
it’s confirmed. the world is ending
happy St. Patrick's Day, matpat.
I am from the south east, I have never in my life been asked "what kind of coke do you want?". You assume that is the brand on offer, but nobody says coke to mean anything but just that.
You should also try kroger real sugar soda if you can find it near you.
Maison VTT
MatPat: You’ve probably never heard of Food Lion Me who lives in the south: How dare? 🤣 also I’ve seen enough Food Lion ads to know what it is 😂
Alright let’s be honest here, maple syrup is just the best.
Steph is right. Coke Zero is the best  Also, I call it soda
wooooo Steph's a Coke 0 fan like meeeeeeee!!!
In egypt we called them by their name   Wow

Mat, we call it "soda" in Wisconsin.
But why diet coke is like the drink of the theorists... Anyway have a like
Japanese soda is good
We called it Soda Pop
OMG ANTIQOLOGY!
I use the term soda and I'm an oddball that likes RC Cola, but my favorite diet soda is Diet A&W Root Beer
Now I want to see that other type of Coke Off
Canadian here and I say pop.
There are food lions in Maryland
why diet and not regular? just wondering.
can you make a food theory what happnes when you grill ceryol
8:04 MEDICINAL FLAVOR AHAHA <333
We be a pop people up in Chicago
I drink coke zero religiously. And by religiously I mean the once or twice a week I actually have a cola, because I live off of water, coffee and carbonated waters with no sodium and no chemical sweeteners. Which I found so far to be like.. two brands. Aha and La Croix. Aha is way better by the way..   But as far as diet sodas go, for reals, Coke Zero all the way.
Food Lion (North Carolina exclusive) Me: *side eyes the Food Lion in Southern Kentucky*
18:55 they’re not married for no reason
For me, it will always be: #1 Diet Pepsi, #2 Diet Coke I'm "pop"…coming from a "soda" family.
B just B
I say soda, being from the east coast 😁
growing up bilingual in the south west I always say soda cause in japanese it's also called soda
Your method works to find out the best cola but not to find out the worst or anything but the best cola because they might fight bad or good contenders so they might be at the end or the start
Irn bru is far superiour...
Im a fizzy drink kinda guy. Btw i live in arizona
Almost all of our food lions got switched to Weis
Other (Pepsi)
D : soft drink
Anyone else notice there seems to be a green flash occassionally? Like the video edit is corrupted?
Ask anyone in my family, Diet Coke is my drug!
Omg Food Lion still exists?!
Fun fact: my brother was watching this while I was sleeping and I could fricking HEAR it
Anyone notice the glitch at 13:31? Also, Food Lion is also owned by the parent company of Stop & Shop in New York. I love Food Lion.
Mat is a Robot built by Stephanie to make great content and be kind: CONFIRMED. Final Evidence Found - Power Source: Diet Cola. *Impressive to note how efficiently this power source runs, after a year Mat is staring to Power Down, Case and point, "Quote of Mat being incorrect about something"* - Unknown Researcher. However it appears Stephanie is testing prototypes for an alternate energy source. ( Perhaps the wear on Mat's internal systems was getting pricey to repair) I am excited to see MatBot getting an upgrade and hopefully the new model has some extra gadgets. (Maybe an extendo-arm, ya know for... Ehh..Fun?)
Steph is just looking at matt like "why don't you impress me, huh?"
Oh come on you can't use a fountain drink, all fountains mix settings for water to flavor ratio are a bit different and the ones at places like mcdonald's are specifically set high enough to account for ice in the glass. You should have used your go to source and if that's fountains then the availability aspect should have ruled out other contenders any way
"probably never heard of food lion" he said, ignoring how weirdly often it comes up in Rhett and Link videos.
There's a harris teeter's by my house in MD!
I call it pop, as I am a true canadian
I live in new zealand and we normally call then fizzy drinks or soft drinks
I'm going drink lots of diet coke because they said not to. And I'm not talking soda
in Australia most of us call it soft drink
I don't believe you matpat
soft drink of fizzy
Looks like MattPatt is finally kicking his coke habit.
I mean, Stephanie is right of course. Coke is the way to go. Remember when we moved to Colorado and a doctor misunderstood my mother’s self admitted coke addiction as something slightly different
Soda
WHAT!!!! Mat is not drinking Diet Coke anymore!!?
NANI
Coke Zero all day
4:38  Mat Pat while holding a straw: Let the Diet Coke off begin!  Good thing you said the word "diet" there.
Coca-Cola Zero taste like candles.
Grew up calling it pop, but at some point we switched to soda and it stuck
Try ginger ale
Good call.
Impossible
Waiter: What kind of coke do you want Me: water
From the time I was a kid until age fourteen, I used to drink a flat of President's Choice Cola every week or two. Though by fourteen, I had a ton of health issues and my insides felt like a corkscrew. I briefly was a Lipton tea soda person until I found my new passion: Craft beer (and Coke Zero). So, I switched my 5 PC Colas a day to 2 Craft beers a day and a couple of Coke Zeros a month, yes I was underage drinking. Kids, don't underage drink, it was just a big thing where I came from, like starting at a certain age, parents expected you to drink with them.   Then, seven years ago, I went really healthy, I started gradually watering my Coke Zero down with San Pelligrino until I was drinking straight San Pell. Now, I drink San Pellegrino most often but will have a Coke Zero every seven months or so. I have no regrets, in fact, I feel great!
Granted I haven’t tried Harris Teeter diet cola, but I’m definitely with Steph here; Coke Zero is undoubtedly better than Diet Coke.👀
try sunkist
so no one gonna talk about the glitches throughout the video?
Buzzfeed but science
Kinda doubt you will go out of your way..
I havent watched the video yet, but starting off by saying, I work for Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pepper will track you down and hide Dr. Pepper and A&W in your house if you won't drink it lol.
Steph staring at matpat like WHO ARE YOU?!
I live in Oklahoma and here we call it Soda.
13:31?
dr pepper is king and i will not have anyone say otherwise
I call em soft drinks
Don't know about cola, but i can confirm 3 flavors of root beer. Barks has bite, like mild dr.pepper. a&w i think is the sweet one, if not it has the med taste. Med as in not sweet and no bite.
WEGMANS!! it’s a top company in the US for its employees and you didn’t even mention their far superior store brand products!
Only OGs will remember MattPatt’s obsession with Diet Coke
A: it's fun watching people taste things I'm deathly allergic to, and B: did anyone else see that weird glitch thing durring the Johnny rian thing?
4:05 I was anxious when I saw the green bars across the screen here since I though my monitor was breaking :"D
I think dr thunder lite/diet has no calories
Destinyyyyyyyy
PUBLIX REPRESEEEEEENT 😂😂
The harris teeter picture in the video is literally 10 minutes from my house. I feel so special 🙂
i swear, i remember i just ask him for this couple days ago lol
the fact diet soda's are soooo unhealthy and matpat of all people loves them suprises me, also they taste horrible just why
Drink the filipino soda matpat
Very cool. I'm also almost addicted to Diet Coke but prefer Coke Zero. I'm going to try HT this weekend.  BTW, I'm from NC too. I call soda "coke" too. It's just a southern thing.
Diet pepsi
All this talk about sweetness, can you do a video on artificial sweeteners, natural sweeteners other than sugar and their effect on health
I def say "soda", which makes sense cuz I'm from the west coast.
Well... Glad I'm near a Harris Teeter then. Guess I'll give it a go. opo
Stevia is actually better if it's mixed with sugar. You use a lot less sugar but what little you do use takes the edge off. That said, I happen to like Zevia...
Kroger is where my sister works right down the road from me.
Where in North Carolina are you from ??
coca cola doesn't want to sponsor mat pat. hunts for a new diet cola.
Mr. Pat, to be a “click bait title” it needs to be at least SOME WHAT believable.  EDIT: After watching the video..... I don’t know you any more man. All of 2020!? You posted videos in 2020 and they ALL talked about your obsession with Diet Coke. I do t know what to believe in any more :’(
Mexican soda is better then American soda, prove me wrong
As a Kroger associate. Mathew I can confirm.
Americana sodas, specifically vanilla, and dads cream soda, Americana differs with temperature though
Diet Pepsi? Graah
TIL that Food Lion isn't a nationwide chain
Anyone else triggered that they shared the same straws?
Pop all the way
ummmm... you realize that pepsi is also originally from nc
*me watching this on my break from my job at Kroger* "of course it's f*cking kroger, kroger is everywhere"
I thought Orange Vanilla Coke tasted better from a soda fountain!
The moment you mentioned Fred Meyers  I got simultaneously so excited and sad, I love Fred Meyers but haven't lived by one in like 8 years. _Siiiiiigggghhhhh_ The issues of being military and moving every two years
I've always been a fan of colas in general, top is tied between RC and Coke.
Quick, say heresy if your being held at gunpoint
The Food Lion label looked familiar so I searched up Hannafords owner company. Long story short the company owns Food Lion and Hannaford
Nice released on St Patrick's day, I guess his favorite drink is a diet Coke and jack

I thought you were single
17:32 finally, someone gets it!
13:30 weird glitch
I'm weird I like specifically flat diet coke as well as monster energy, polar opposites.. both delicious, I'll purposefully shake up my diet coke some to make it flatter..
Its not diet or cola but Jones cream soda is really good and brings me nostalgia but its 6 bucks for 4 glass bottles
omg food lion i havent seen one them sence i moved away from north carolina when i was 10 heck across the streat from the food lion was another food store called piggly wiggly which actuly had a price war with eachother one closed i cant remeber which though
Does anyone else see the glitches/flashes or is my YouTube bugging out?
"Do as I say not as I do." - Spoken like a true parent.
From New Orleans they are called "Cold Drinks".
umm we have food lion in WV too like it's not only in SC just wanted to put that out there
Never ever flavor soda streams with the soda stream branded syrup. Use mio or crystal light water enhancers. Specifically the crystal light strawberry lemonade slaps so hard.
In japan its called cola
It's coke or pop here in good old Canada. Just curious, why does normal coke taste like coke zero after having ice cream?
I'm 100% soda. (btw I'm from Missouri)
Diet coke was good but  Diet coke is better
Coke zero is miles better than diet coke
Diet Dr. Pepper > All other Diet Sodas
I call it soda! Always have, always will! :)
I am Diet Coke but without the t Coke
Did anyone else catch like a video glitch at 13:30?
Toasted Vanilla Diet Coke Xtra

imagene if diet coke wanted to sponsore you
This video should be named Cokes got talent .
As a north Carolinian I internally freak out when he says he lives here  Edit: there are people who don't know about food lion?!?!  Edit2: I just call them soft drinks
PUBLIX 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Harris Teeter gang REPRESENT!
Hey, maybe Harris Teeter will sponsor a few videos!
Does Matt seriously think we don't know what food lion is?
Lol the photo they used for Harris Teeter was the one I worked at in high school
Bro Idek he lived here in NC. Mr.Beast and Mat Pat both live here
I live in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania and we have a food lion in our little town.
The first thing you did wrong was drink diet soda in the first place 😆
My family exclusively buys Harris Teeter soda because none of us can really tell the difference.
Mountain Lightning is better than Mountain Dew imo.
Kroger owning them explains why it was so good. Big K(kroger's house brand soda) has always(at least last 25 years) been very good
soft drink....always has been
I quit diet coke Which one
The best answer for your body is "Unsweetened, but optionally creamed, coffee and water. Plain water." Not necessarily the best for your taste buds of course, and you're a lot skinnier than I am so you must've been doing something else right in spite of drinking diet Coke.
Check Good Mythical Morning to confirm the Kroger theory
Fizzy drink
Yayyy were getting a Harris teeter across the street from my work
Swede here, living in Australia, people say soft drink instead of soda, but in Sweden (for English signs and stuff, Swedes are known for being really good at English), we say Soda when talking English.
Yeah... you really can't go farther east or south than Florida WITHOUT sacrificing more of south or east, respectively, than you gained of east or south. A few states are, in whole or in part, farther east than Palm Beach Shores, but you have to go farther north to get to them than you went east; only part of Hawaii is farther south than Key West, but you have to go farther west to get to it than you went south. (Yes, you could go the other way in both instances, but that distance is even farther.)  There used to be a Food Lion in my city. Now the nearest one to me appears to be in Savannah, Georgia. The nearest Harris Teeter to me is closer, in Fernandina Beach... but I'm still not going there. There 's used to be a Pick 'n' Save in my city. Technically, the closest one's in Waycross, Georgia, but the closest one in my state is, again, in Fernandina Beach.  I saw a map a while back of what people called soda by county, and I was actually in a "soda" county surrounded by an absolute SEA of "Coke" counties. (Funnily enough, this comes up in the pre-game banter for the Jackbox Party Pack 3 game Guesspionage.)
Diet coke tastes like licking a spoon
I caught that "Florida not being Southern" pun Steph! True South gang rise up!
those artificial sweeteners used to replace sugar for diet versions of soda is so much more dangerous than natural sugar
I have type one diabetes so I drink Diet Coke a lot because that’s usually the only diet drink they have in restaurants and it’s so goooood
diet soda can actually be worse for you because they put fake sugar in it
But I thought they had eliminated flavored sodas like fruity flavored sodas.
I'm only 3 minutes in, but I'm going to guess Zevia's going to lose on the flavor. One thing it does certainly win at is not being unhealthy at all. update: yup. it's very common for stevia to be an acquired taste.
There relationship ends because of coke.
all sodas are unhealthy :c
Big K is the same, bought it at smiths
Day 2 of asking Mat or Austin to make a Godzilla Monsters of Monsters creepypasta video (You know, the one with red?)
i saw the thumbnail and now me and my cousins are circling our smart tv in confusion
Okay. Grew up in a place where everyone called it “soda”, but my grandma called it “pop”, and my dad taught me to call it “coke”. Helps that diet coke was the only thing my family drank anyway
I could easily, if it was sold in such measures, drink a gallon of Coke a day. I can drain a 2 liter bottle with barely any notice in a couple hours, and to empty two 44 oz. sodas from Sonic without thinking is trivial to me.
Yes! North Carolina represent!
Other: My family usually calls it by it's brand/name, so if it's Crush we might call it Crush (though we're likely to call it orange/cream soda/ etc), Pepsi is 'a Pepsi' and Coke is 'a Coke'

WV native, NC living at the moment, I say soda.
Sometimes coke sometimes other
DONT DO IT, DONT GO BACK TO SODA!!!
D :cool drink
there are many species of Cokémon
what are those glitchs at 13:31 ?
Good job
We all love Dr Pepper Cream Soda.
Nice
They said it couldn't be done
I'm b
tea
im 'D' here in nz its called fizzy
Ima start calling soda “ that bubblie”
thank god you were quitting drinking diet coke i thought you said you quit youtube phew
Mat, almost nobody here calls soda, pop.  Things seem to have changed.
Question. They say sugary soda overloads your system, and sugar free soda tricks your insulin production and that can mess you up. So what if you mix a sugar free soda with a little of its sugary counterpart?
Big  red big  blue edit big red all good
Idk if it bugs anyone else but I always dislike that on tournaments, they have 1st go against 16th. Like what is the underdog of underdogs suppose to do against The top dog of top dogs.
This episode has got some gmm vibes to it.
I have a Kroger within walking distance from me, I know what I’m doing tomorrow
As someone who likes soda, don't drink diet soda, it is worse healthwise and tastes worse.
i’m cocaine
Pop up here in Canada to
Now you need an episode where you design your own diet cola....
In Australia we call them soft drink
If this was soda only  coke original would win
Here in Texas it is coke, and dr. Pepper is the best coke
As a South Carolinian I would like to speak on behalf of all South Carolinians that the Harris teeter and food lion comments made us even more salty towards North Carolina
I’m a soda guy
Harris teeter was there when matpat needed them the most lol
I didn't realise Australia had different diet Coke and Pepsi from America. We call soda soft drink.
Another fun episode. Thank you for the wholesome entertainment.
Soda
Matpat’s the man version on the Scarlet Witch/WandaXD
I have been eating Kroger brand all over the country (Detroit Mi, Reno Nv, and Baton Rouge La)  and it Always taste the same! I love that fact if I can find a Kroger company I can get my favorite cereal. Just saying!
Austin should do a video on every single match of smash bros ultimate
I thought pepsi zero sugar was pepsi max no?
14:30 That's because Diet Pepsi is trash. Just awful. Diet Coke legitimately tastes more like Pepsi than Diet Pepsi, because Diet Coke is based on the "New Coke" formula that basically mimicked Pepsi because Pepsi was beating Coca-Cola in the market. How could Pepsi get their own diet version so wrong?
I haven't had any soda since I was 16 lol
as a floridian, its coke. everything is coke
I've always used and heard Soda.  Pop is alright, but using Coke as a blanket for soda in general is fucking stupid.
Further proof that North Carolina is the most underrated state in the US
Soda. Decidedly soda. In the south I refuse to call dr. Pepper a coke
Algorithm
Mat, you need to make an entire video on aspartame alone. When you're worth hundreds of billions like Cola, you probably want to maintain your wealth, and part of that is making sure aspartame remains "safe" by funding journals and experiments.
Pop
what is his thing with diet soda anyway i cant stomach a diet soda
C
Yeah, not a huge fan of coke, but, the store brand "Fanta" I actually like better than normal Fanta + it's like 2.5 times cheaper and 0.5 liters more, also it has to be the light version, if they had a zero version I would get it but sadly only light, soooo yeah
Thanks Steph. To me,, it's al Coke. I'm from the south also. Tuckesee. Kentucky/ Tennessee area. Most people with me tho. Lol Also Matpat, Food Lion is a store that I grew up with near Bowling Green, KY.
The numbers are completely wrong. 1 vs 16; 2 vs 15; 3 vs 14; 4 vs 13; 5 vs 12; 6 vs 11; 7 vs 10; 8 vs 9
do kfc dateing  gtlive
What were those glitches? New ARG?
Diet Coke is just a shook up flat Diet Pepsi
Matpat isn’t MatPat without Diet Coke
BLASPHEMY!!!!
It's just called coke. "Yall wanna coke?" "Yeah! You got root beer?" ... "want fries and a coke with that?" "Yes please, medium and a sprite" ... "I'm sorry, maam, we don't have coke. Is Pepsi ok?" "...so we're gonna cancel the apps, and head out."
I would like seeing thus again but with a twist where they compare American sodas to mexican sodas
ngl sams cola is my fav coke
Being a person who loves Moxie, the Boylan Diet Cola is pretty good. I can assure you that the rest of Boylans sodas are more typical and very good!
No one say Pepsi
He does know that crystal pepsi re released in like 2017 right
Citric acid is also the secret ingredient in homemade gummy bears.
It doesn't taste chemically... wait
Instead of drinking soda drink juice apple juice
Both soda and pop
I just wanted to vote that I say sodapop
I quit Coke because of what they told me to less of a couple weeks ago.
Try rc cola
Grew up sayin' soda
I live in Ohio so uh pop ofc
Call it "soft drinks". Or just drinks. I'm thirsty now
Boylan makes amazing grape soda
Diet rc cola
when i get soda at restaurants i always call them soft drinks.
mountain. freakin'. DEW
B.soda
Maaan, I always enjoy a good can of Zevia a shame it didn’t make it through. You should try their other flavors they are very good
coke
We call it coke or soft drinks
I have lived in North Carolina all my life (we were ecstatic to hear y'all moved here during quarantine!) and through this video I just now realized that lots of people don't know what Food Lion or Harris Teeter are. It's real weird man... Real weird
Im a Minnesotan so we say SOOda, with an elongated vole
The krabby Patty's secret ingredient is citric acid
fountain drinks have different settings. the taste will depend on the water to syrup ratio. The can and bottle are set at the factory so will be much more consistent
Matpat is wrong we’ve got Food Lion here in Georgia.
I've literally watched every single video on this channel! I'm not joking, this content is amazing! Its like a movie marathon that i can watch over and over again! c:
My mom says pop and my dad says soda, but I unconsciously change depending on who's parents we're seeing. The more north we head the more likely I am to say pop, but since I live in North Carolina I say soda in my day-to-day life. My brothers have also caught me saying 'soda-pop'
Walmart brand cream soda is way too good
Yeah, bro. Stephanie's right. I was raised in the south, so they're all cokes to me. Lmao.
Stephanie's joke should have been: "Can't believe you TEETERed that way"
14:50 Anyone going to tell him Pepsi is from North Carolina, too? So North Carolina beat North Carolina...
I didn't know Whole Foods has diet soda. However, thanks to this video, I'm glad that I'm not getting their brand. And besides, Mom isn't ordering any of their sodas. ;-)
I say pop unless it’s fancy then I’ll call it soda
Soda.🤘🤙👈👉
Food 4 less doesnt exist over here anymore lol its now food maxx
Add citric acid to diet coke
I stopped drinking soda and juice in favour of kombucha as its sugar free, caffeine free, and doesn’t give me a headache. It’s way more expensive but that encourages me to drink water more
7:41 Greatest part to take out of Context
Fellow Midwesterner and pop user.
Team SODA!!!!
Anyone else see the 3 way champion ship part and hear the announcer from Cars : "the legend (diet coke), the runner up (coke zero sugar), and the rookie (Harris teeter), 3 cars, one champion
D: Other      Bibia
What's the difference between Diet Coke and Coke Zero?
B. soda
Give us more of your wife comentarios pls.
Who hasn't heard of food lion lol
I cannot speak for soda manufactures but I can say with confidence that Oak Farms Dairy produces milk for Costco brand Kirkland and Walmart brand Great Value but they do taste slightly different.
Irs official, the worlds ending
Drink water
Pop is the only legitimate phrase
Definitely pop, everyone calls it pop where i live
I'm definitely a soda namer
Both the diet cola and the Zero calorie big k have citric acid. I’m almost certain the winner is the zero calorie big k. I am addicted to Coke Zero. My tastings were close between both the big k and Coke Zero, but data was inaccurate because the Coke was cold and the big k was room temp. The citric acid is very subtle, but enjoyable. I think it’s a toss up in my opinion, but I think it’s up to each of you to try it for your self 10/10 recommend
Here in my county we don't say Coke or Soda, we just say coca cola. Even if it's pepsi or any other brand
Have you ever try drinking water
Coke lol weirdos
I say soda
South Louisiana, definitely C-"coke" down here
Soda in casual talk. I always order my drink by the name of the drink, however, to skip the debate at meal time.
FYI Crystal Pepsi was around just before the pandemic. Brought it back.
CURSED TITLE
Next up: I quit water
it's all coke here
15:30 pepsi
When I heard “Kroger” I got a fight or flight reaction
I like that the sodas were not openly labeled at first glance. It removes at least one layer of bias. <o/
Coke ZERO
When Harris Teeter actually beat MatPat's tounge%
Hey Mat! I didn't know you were from NC 😃 just wanted to say how much I love your theory's on here and your other channels! You are my favorite YouTuber ever!
I don’t wanna brag but do you think of obeying a certain “server” when you see his red leather jacket?
Um. MatPat. Florida is _not_ a Southeastern state. It might be geographically located there, but it's not "in the Southeast".
Australian here, I've only ever called it soft drink....
I will say me being from the south, everything is a coke but me personally I call it by the names
Soda gang representing. Pop is a verb and Coke is the name of a specific soda and drug
Cherry Coca-Cola is my favorite lol!!😱🥺😁😊🥳🤯💖💝💋👍✊👏💪💟💌😎
Is food theory or food channel I know it’s hard work 😓
We just call them Soft Drinks in Singapore.
Beverage Theory
All this work to get the to the bottom of the best trash flavor soda, you read that right, diet drinks are the worst!
Americans:Pop soda Australians: softy, soft drink, fizzy
All diet colas are poison.
I grew up drinking Big K diet cola. We preferred it to coke or pepsi. I feel it has bigger carbonation bubbles, like pepsi but the sweetness of diet coke; it just tasted better, now I know why.  I've since switched to Coke Zero, when I do drink soda.   Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience with Big K,. No one understood what I was talking about, until now.
Me who’s living in India currently but lived in North Carolina for 8 years and never had a single taste of that:
Honestly, if I choose soda for my household, I always pick Big K because they taste better and are WAY cheaper, for all flavors. Rhett and Link also have a penchant for Kroger branded stuff when they blind taste. They make some delicious stuff!
Soda
just drink water XD
Well, as someone who lives in NC, it appears I'll be trying Harris Teeter brand cola again.
matt broken someone needs to force feed him some Diet Coke OK NOW WE NEED TO FIX HIM THE DAD PATTS TASTE HAS CHANGED FOR THE HORRID SODA BRAND HE WILL LIKE Diet Coke AGAIN
B and D
DR.Pid
That speech about the culture be nominated for an Oscar
I thought diet Coke was worse for you than actual Coke
• 14:36 - As a matter of fact, I _do_ know about Food Lion because of Jordan Maron's r/crappyoffbrands Jordan Reacts video from just under two months ago. • 15:27 - You're missing a few options: E: Soft-drink, F: Carbonated beverage, G: Soda-pop • 16:32 - Store brands are also cheaper. Yes, sometimes they're good. (But sometimes they're _horrible._ )
lol, with all that sugar dude is gunna be able to stay up writing theories for at least a day
C: Coke XD I recognize how wrong/weird it is to call all soda "coke".
shoutout to everyone who calls soda soft drink
So long Diet Coke, you were a good friend throughout the years....m
B: soda
“You’ve probably never heard of food lion” ITS REGIONAL?! I live in VA literally I’m between two good lions, one is a half a mile away and the other is like a mile and a half. Also Harris Teeter? 3 miles away, with another one maybe 6 or 7. Life is crazy
As a Coke Zero fan myself, I am quite happy that my choice of diet soda stands among the top 3.  Also, I find it interesting that Harris Teeter is the underdog that came out on top. MinuteEarth has a video on biodiversity using beer as an example to show how smaller beer firms survive by using the same strategies that rainforests use to survive. And I guess by having a unique flavor over the more average flavored Coke, Harris Teeter gets a win on Matt's book:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atg-5Nqszxw  I guess the lesson of this theory is that, if you find a local brand of anything including diet soda, give those products a chance over your preferred mainstream brand. You may find your new love the same way Matt found his new diet soda love in the form of Harris Teeter diet soda.
Anyone notice the glitches in the video?
In Australia it’s ‘soft drink’
DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES
Ughhh you missed Mexican COKE with sucrose
A A A A POP ALL DA WAEE
If only I could give him my home make cola I have never had someone not ask for more
Coke
Screw the Coke sponsorship that you’ve been shooting for for years, it’s time for you guys to get that coveted Harris-Teeter sponsorship now!
egads matt!  what hast happened to you!
ok
I call it pop
We have kingsoopers in Colorado. Thier regular cola is crap compared to coke and im not a fan of diet soda but im curious it could be the same as Harris teeter. You showed a bottle of big k and that what my store sells
Haven't heard of Food Lion in a long time. My small town in southeast Pennsylvania used to have one. We even took a kindergarten "field trip" to see the their behind the scenes. Feels surreal looking back.
Well then it seems we are all paying for advertisement
my favorite drink of all time is a bit of strawberry lemonade mixed with some sprite, and add in some strawberries/lemons  it's so good and the sprite gives it a bubbly little kick to it :3
rock paper scissors proves there a hive mind
all soda taste the same to me
Cold drink is what I say
*When we saw the thumbnail we all panicked*
Im betting on pepsi
15:29 D. Other.  Australians often call it softdrink.
Coke Zero my guy
MatPat at end: talking about why its the best Steph's Face: :OOO
In  Nebraska is a mix of cola and pop.
fun fact: Mcdonald's diet coke tastes better than any other companies because they get their syrup shipped in metal boxes rather than plastic bags.
The Food Theorists Can I be your friends I want to be your family I love all your channel and you seem chill
I have a feeling that after this video matpat and steph had a the equivalent of an adrenaline rush
I grew up calling it pop. Whenever I order any type of pop I always get a weird look because I live in the southeast.
What’s with all the glitching and artifacts in the video? Is it a YouTube thing? Because other videos have the same artifacting
I lived in the south but my mom always called it soda so I called it soda.
Mans started out this video with "I'm looking for a replacement addiction"
I love the channel, been watching since it started.  However a couple of comments on this.  Comparing a fountain pour to cans or bottles is not a valid test.  Mat pointed it out himself, the method of delivery affects the taste.  Only a few of these are available as a fountain beverage, so it would be interesting to see a head to head on those via fountain pour.  Also, as a user of Soda Stream, that is an extremely variable experience even with a single flavor.  You fill the bottle with water to the "Max Fill" line. Do you use filtered or from the tap?  You measure out the syrup "to suit your taste".  You add the carbonation by pressing a button "X" number of times for "X" number of seconds, again according to  preference.  All  points where a slight change one way or the other affects the flavor of the final beverage.   And...just as an aside..."soda"...and I rank Diet Coke at pretty much near the bottom with Coke Zero at the top.  At least among straight up colas.  Step  outside of that lane, then give me a diet Dew or Dr. Pepper.
oh god matpat is markiplier with takis but insteed its diet coke
I used to be a big fan of A&W root beer and cream soda. I found great value cream soda and I have never gone back to A&W. Great value cream soda has a creamier, sweeter taste than the spicy taste you get from A&W brand
#Popgang
A
NOOOOOOOO
In Australia we call it soft drink. Not sure why, maybe something to do with the bubbles?
I would love to see the Kroger zero calorie theory. It’s interesting. Loved this video
Hey MAtPaT how about   Diet Dr pepper
What kinda fizzer you want?
D: Nectar of the gods.
Pop
I don’t think it’s fair to use fountain Diet Coke because that’s not what you are going to be drinking the most
B: Soda
My Kroger is named Turkey Hill, if anyone wanted to know in PA
What would happen if Weirdmagedon actually went worldwide.
Where did over the teeth over the gums come from
It seems unfair to compare fountain diet coke to all the bottles and cans. You can't store bunched of fountain drinks at home and maintain the flavor..... seems kind of like cheating
What parallel universe is this
Harris Teeter's parent corp is Kroger, which owns Ralph's here in SoCal.  I love Ralph's Zero Cola as well.
I am B and C I just switch between them
B
I like coke just not this kind
how poetic
Can you do study about carbonated water with soda flavours because to me its taste the same but the carbonated seems more healthier
Coke quick!!! Time to ship matpat a lifetime supply of Diet Coke to regain your follower!!!!
3:45 Captions
This is how real adults settle problems. rock paper scissors
He said Harris teeter and I felt physically pain from when I lived in NC and had to go there
Turn subtitles on here - 3:45  In front of his wife!!!!!!!!!!!
In texas it's all coke - c

Kroger kills it! Most of their stuff is better than the name brand!
Kinda hard to believe mat and Steph are married They just act like good friends Idk might just be me Tho that might be the best kind of marriage
I DARE you seek the Captions and see what's wrong
Mattpat: I quit diet coke  Me: *dies in shock*
I do really like Kroger’s Big K diet cola

I am here after a video about lions Vs the sun
He should try inca cola, it's from Peru it doesn't match his criteria but I think he should try it at least once. It isn't even a cola it just tastes amazing
Who are you and what have you done to the real mat pat
The only diet cola I like is the one from zevia
Everyone know that diet coke can never die and I doubt that your gonna completely stop drinking it after this 😂😂😂
I say soda the most but I do say pop sometimes and if I mean a cola type like what you tried today I would call it coke lol
I have found Kroger products are quite tasty
People in the east call it نوشابه(nooshäbe)
I live in north carplina about a little over an hour from Jacksonville and before going on vacation with my fiancee to florida I had never even heard of a publix
There's a frame that glitches 13:31 And put ot at 0.25×
Starting vid: he's not gonna quit diet coke End: OK ssssssssoooooooo I called wrong
Okay, so. Get this. NON-DIET COKE!
Who else can agree that steph is an absolute dime and always looks fucking amazing in these videos

I’m more of a Pepsi max cherry Pepsi max raspberry sort of guy
Aspartame. Why is this still a thing?
in australia, its all "soft drink"
Good mythical morning style!
This is a real big deal dite Cola was his IMAGE!
This is impossible
I Work at Kroger: A few years ago we received, 12 pack cans of Kroger Big K Diet Soda,  BUT Inside was Harris Teeter Brand Diet Cola. So i can CONFIRM for you they do INDEED come from the same bottling plant.
Me my whole life thinking that Harris teeter and food lion was everywhere else
Diet Pepsi for the win! Jk, of course
I drink Diet Bepis
I only drink kroger brands so I believe it
Wow.  Actually not clickbait.
Why are there green static flashes
As an Ohioan it bothers me that everyone around me calls it pop and not soda
Harris Teeter is my favorite grocery. I went there all the time when I was a kid
O hey food lion is near my house  Neet
Would you do with my mat pat I will refuse to believe he dint choose diet cook
I like Zevia Ginger Root beer :p
Personally i prefer diet pepsi but to each their own
umm is the green line supposing to be there
Collab between GMM and Food Theory is within reach! Please let it happen
Soft drink
I don't Like Soda. I Stick to Soft drinks 🙃 I don't Like the burning in my throat.
Mid Missouri: Soda
Grew up in Michigan, where everyone calls it pop.  My grandma called it soda, so I was used to that, or at least it doesn't sound weird to me. .  With my job I travel a lot and tend to call it soda which seems to work everywhere.  I'm curious where calling it a coke is normal, I haven't run across it much, only time I can recall was in Kansas city MO once.  expected it in Georgia but never heard it there.
Diet coke tastes like unfiltered pool water. Salty sweat and sunscreen are the main ingredients!
0:50 Ironically, wasn't Scott Cawthon the reason why Mat Pat has an emotional dependency on Diet Coke? This was mentioned in that one FNAF theory episode where Scott completely forgot about lobotomy that should have been implemented in FNAF 4.
Where I live we call them soft drnks
B)
Me whos drinking a sprite while watching this:
My wife and mother-in-law work ar HT. We're Carolina folks. My wife was EXTREMELY happy about this video. Thanks.
Dr.pepper! anything else is heresy.
I wanna pay attention to, ya know, the actual video and data and all but I'm too busy focusing on how adorable of a couple these two are.
Not Physically Possible
I didn't know food lion was local. I live in VA and I thought it was big like Kroger.
impossible
Food loin is in VA also Matpat
I love coca cola original
Matt patt at the end  I'm shooketh
Normal coke
WE AT FOOD THEORISTS DO NOT SUPPORT MASS CONSUMPTION OF DIET COKE DESPITE MATT'S INEXPLICABLE ABILITY TO DRINK GALLONS ON AN HOURLY BASIS
Anyone else seeing this glitch at 13:30?
People after this episode  Harris teeter: What is happening? Why is the diet soda selling like turkey on Thanksgiving  Employee: I don't know sir , they said that a diet soda finatic prefers our brand rather than diet coke
Matpat: "Totally Scientific" Also Mat: Does Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide in a divide of judgement in the sample space.
Soda if you disagree,.. eh
I’ve heard of Food Lion...and the atrocities they were responsible for lol.
I loved Food Lion as a kid!! It gave away free left over cookies from the baked goods section.❤️❤️
Right off the bat, this isn’t right. You can’t have bottles and cans compete with fountain pop. Everyone knows that fountain pop is always the best.
NC gang where ya at!!!!
RIP Matpat
How about a theory on how foods that are labeled 0 calories aren’t actually 0 calories and about how nutrition labels lie all the time would be interesting to see what u could find
THAT FUCKING PLOT TWIST 😱😱😱
PUBLIX POG
What's with the random green artifacts? Video get corrupted?
I have a theory. Is it just me or is plenty of youtube videos having these static flashes like in 13:30? I am getting it all over all the youtube videos i'm watching.
Harris teetering the scales!
I say soda but down here in Texas I've heard someone call it "So-de water"  Also we have a store called HEB and I prefer Dr.B to real Dr.Pepper
😮
Wait...  I thought Coke addiction was a running joke in this channel....
Lmao food
Is pepsi max I'm usa or does it have another name overthere?
hmm... Kroger ad? Grubhub ad? lol
Where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, I generally heard it referred to as Soda, Soda Pop, or Cola.
IMPOSSIBLE
Haven’t gotten too far into the episode but Dr Pepper must win
me who lives in NC and knows what Food Lion is
Glitches? In my Food[Game] Theory video? You can't think that I'll believe it was an accident
Here we call it (in translation to English) "sparkling" (or maybe it's "fizzy")  And then for specifics we would call them by their name: Coka Cola - Coka Cola or just Cola Pepsi - Pepsi Sprite - Sprite Fanta - Fanta  Etc.  But we call sparkling water "soda"
Food lion is a north Carolina thing? I live in TN and we have one
Simply put u need help Matt
Harris teeter gaaaaang
Anyone gonna talk about how food lion isnt exclusively in North Carolina?
D - Fizzy :3
I live in Sweden and a few years. OK so quite a while back, a consumer show that aired on national TV did a test much like this. The big difference was that they didn't tell the panel what any of the Cokes were, so no one knew what they were tasting, or if it even was different products in the glasses. So it was as close to a blind test as they could get. They to ended up with a store brand Cola in the top slot. The interesting thing was the number of people who wrote things like "There's nothing like the original!" and other similar things. I think it was something like 70 or 80 % who was convinced that they had picked the original Coca-Cola, and the majority of those claimed that their second choice wasn't even close. I tried the store brand and I can't say I think it was better than original Coca-Cola, but then I had to pour it out of the extremely cheap and flimsy plastic bottle seeing the very cheaply designed label on the bottle and that might have influenced me more than I'd like to admit. I also have a feeling that the quality varied a lot more than what original Coke tends to do. But again, this might have been influenced by the poor quality of the bottles and labels.
In the northeast we have the grocery store shop rite which also has some pretty good store brand products.
Growing up in a particular state, I used to call them sodas. Now that I have lived a while, I now call them colas.
Thanks this was helpful for knowing what soda to try.
Boy lands root bear slaps
My favorite has always been cream soda, and it's criminally underrated.  Especially when you mix it with ginger ale.  My friend and I did this as kids, we called it Ginger Cream lmao.
Soda stream has quite a bit of variables. The amount of co2 and syrup
Regionally I would call it Soda, Like if I'm ordering it I would be like "can I get some soda?" but my family also calls soda "taste" because My little siblings wpuld go to my parents, who were avid soda drinkers, and say "can i have some taste?" because thats how they asked "can i have a taste?" and my parents thought it was funny enough that its forever been put on the shopping list as "taste" when it means they want to get some more soda for the house.
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! THE DIET COKE SALES HAVE DROPPED 50%
anyone els catch the visual artifact after mat says flavor at 13:30 i feel some arg shenanigans are afoot
Definitely call it soda
I'll stick to my Diet RC
Grew up coke but my regional word is pop or soda-pop
Fun fact about coca cola. When the representais of Coca-Coma co. came to Finland to establish foothold here, they asked for normal tap water to test on. They got that and they got baffled. They asked why they got some elite water instead normal basic tap water. They got straight answer. That was normal water but the thing is that Finland has one of the purest or maybe even purest tap water ever.
I say soda
From Chicago burbs we always called it soda.
Citric acid is also used as a food safe cleaning agent.
Are we just not gonna talk about how Mat new the first three contesters without even knowing at first which one it came from? I cant even tell the difference between 7-up and Sprite.
I live in Virginia about to leave but there are two Food Lions in my area..
I call it soda, cuz sometimes in restaurants, I'll ask for a coke, and they'll be like, we don't have coke, u want Pepsi instead?
There’s more caffeine in Diet Coke then the actually original coke. It’s because without the part that makes it the diet version (don’t remember what it is) to keep it good tasting they add caffeine to keep people interested. And yes they add stuff like that to keep you addicted and that without that “punch” that people crave they go to Diet Coke.
I literally just got home with dinner, and what am I drinking while watching this? Fountain Diet Coke.   Also, this video means a lot to me as a diabetic who can only drink diet. Maybe someday Matt will see the light and realize Diet Dr. Pepper is supreme.
Soda, sometimes soda pop.
I live in Delaware and we have food lions I work there
Just watched a video by moose2 about dyet coce. I subscribe to you... Never seen his channel before. The algorithm is working backwards!
so he likes coal tar its what artificial sugar is mad from and since its not sauger they can advertise it as having  no sauger
D- Softdrink
OMG Shasta is my favorite i live in kansas and here thats like literally the only soda in grocery stores how dare u disrespect it
I’ve been an area where Kroger‘s is not available the only big stores or H-E-B and Walmart where can I find the best soda? Diet soda that is. I am in Texas south Texas
I'm from Australia and call it fizzy drink
D) Other - Fizzy or Soft Drink Also I totally understand where Matt's coming from. When my brothers & I were little LA Diet Ice was our favourite & the only place we got it was from like a dollar store across town. Small store can have some great stuff.
For tasting, you should actually drink some distilled water so as to not leave any aftertaste of the previous cola.
Pepsi
As a North Carolinian, it’s soda. But if you’re talking about Coca Cola it’s Coke.
I vote D. In Australia we call it "soft drink".
My grandma somehow goes through 6 24packs of Diet Coke every two weeks
As someone who lived in Florida for most my live, I can in fact confirm, Florida isn't southeast. Well, not culturally.
there is green flashes through out the video e.g 8:08
Any ARG players wanna say what the "glitch" was
I was raised in the midwest but call it soda and I stop talking to anyone who calls it "pop"
Me guessing before I start the video : Coke
steph really said 👁👄👁
I've lived in the south and the Midwest. It was really hard to break the "call everything a coke" habit. I'm a pop guy.
This isn’t a theory. This is just sad.
I’m from NC so it’s super funny and cute to hear Food Lion and Harris Teeter
I grew up half in the Midwest and half in the south. Thank you for explaining calling it soda, pop, and Coke. I live in California now and everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them this.
coke
The other thing we know about Matt is that he's absolutely a Closeted Homosexual and his wife is aware and plays along for some reason...
All diet sodas are bad for you. I'm not a doctor but I've heard that artificial sweetners are hard on your body. As in your body cannot process the artificial sugar properly. Again im not a doctor so it be better to ask a professional nutritionist the effects artificial sugar has on your body. But I'm pretty sure it's not a healthier choice over a regular soda and definitely not anywhere close to as healthy as water.
He liked it for 7 YEARS
Michigander here. It is pop. Soda is soda water. Its something specific,  just like coke, pepsi ect. I have also had this debate with pizza. It is not pie. That is a dessert like cherry or apple. Also, the guy goes "pizza pizza" not "pie pie"
Matt: "Oh this is nasty" Also Matt: *goes back for another taste*
I love cough syrup
Soda
my dad calls it sodapop
YOU CANT DO THAT
A
So for Mat, Stephanie, and anyone else who is interested as to why soda tastes different depending on the container: The container that the soda is in changes the flavor. I don't know how it works entirely because I'm not a chemist, nor have I done any real research into this topic to back this up, but based on what little I do know about basic chemistry, specifically acids, I think it has to do with the acidity of soda and the slight breakdown on the inside surface of its container. Coke is acidic enough to be classified as a low power drain cleaner, so it makes sense that it would be just powerful enough to breakdown the inside surface of the container it's in given enough time. That is why you can taste the difference between canned soda, bottled soda, and fountain soda. Canned has a slight metallic taste, but it's not as noticeable as plastic because plastic is easier to breakdown than aluminum. That's why glass bottles have a slight difference too. Glass is harder to breakdown than aluminum, so it has less of impact on the flavor than a can. Finally, that's why fountain soda always tastes the best. While it's just as acidic as it's canned and bottled counterparts all forms of soda are very weak acids, otherwise I don’t think it would be safe for human consumption. Either way, fountain soda hasn't had enough time to start breaking down the inner surface of the cup it goes into because it's mixed right there at the machine. It's literally carbonated tap water and syrup, no plastic, metal, or even glass erosion additives.  Maybe I'm wrong, since I am not an authority on this subject, but this is my theory anyway.
Dude, am I the only one who grew up knowing it as "soda pop"? I'm not that old, I was a 90's kid but still. Seriously?
In canada, you drink pop on the couch, not soda on the sofa.
Root beer shall always be the best in my eyes.
D: i call it by its name
See if you can find tab cola. Its a pretty good cola.
when she said "matthew" i kept expecting her to say "patthew"
"What kinda Coke?" I'll take the kind that turns me into a cryptid.
Pepsi Zero! Or Mountain Dew Zero! Both great "diet" sodas.
Gotta be Pop for sure.   Soda is just soda water, and Coke, is, well, Coke
terelj is a coke that my country makes and we use healthy plants with it so it doesn't weaken bones i drinks it alot it's in mongolia
i love my 3 grams of coke 🤣
I see a potential flaw already: Where did you get the Fountain Diet coke? McD's is different then everywhere else.
should've had great value from walmart in there
Yeah Harris Teeter!!! People in the west gives such weird looks when you mention it.
I got to say soda, I'm right at the tale of Illinois
normal coke xD
Coke Zero will always be my fave
Cola uses citric acid and defeats deit coke . HOW!!
Me: *sees title*   Also me: why do I doubt that tho
Ah diet coke nectar of the gods
coke
After every poorly edited picture of Diet Coke from google images that MatPat has drank, he has finally found a champion, something greater then our long history of Diet Coke. A new diet cola... it is the Harris Teeter. Way to go MatPat! I hope to see more poorly edited pictures of Harris teeter soda from google images in the future!
D - Australian, we call it Soft Drink
I literally just moved to South Carolina. What a coincidence!
wait does this mean Mat is a Harris Teeter addict now?
Steph low-key looking really good tho
Pop? Soda? Coke? We call it SoftDrink
Steph and I had the same expression at the end.
Diet Coke is like a carbonated sizzy liquid you drink for satisfaction heck even for dying.... Quitting diet coke is INSANELY GOOD
what about people outside of the US. Huh, ever think about us?
IMPOSTER THE REAL MATPAT WOULD CHOOSE DIET COKE
still in the early video but soda packaging tier list 1) Glass 2) fountain 3) plastic 4) canned sorry I don't make the rules
I’ll go see if the Kroger diet cola has citric acid
Fountain drinks are always tasting different due to its concentration of it's syrup and it's mixture as certain companies hand mix their concentrate for their soda 😂😂
atleast pepsi still has their 6th largest navy           we will come back with a better soda comrade ☭
Actually my brother and mom used to work at food lion
🥴
Being a NC resident I feel the need to mention cheerwine another NC exclusive.
Omg if you drink even more you mite get drunk
Citric acid is the secret ingredient to the crabby party formula?
Softdrink down here in Australia
in Australia we call it fizzy or soft drink
Coke gang
I grew up calling it fizzy drink. Pop and soda always seemed like such American things but now that I've grown up a bit more I've found out that fizzy was a more regional Australia thing and soda is more of a city one. Pop is still super American though
Bummed at the missed opportunity to tack "-or fall flat and fizzle out of history" with his "-Will you rise to the occasion" intro.
Do the various capitalized letters in the ep description mean something?...
There're various flavored seltzers that have helped me get away from regular soda, make sure to check the label for artificial sweeteners. If U have Kroger where U live, their brand of seltzer has a cola flavor.
How is no one talking about how they use the same straw for tasting
MatPat: Diet Sodas of the world; impress me! Kombucha: Allow me to introduce myself 🥤😎
Future ARG caps in the description?
It’s great that the store closest to you and that was the last minute entry, is the winner
We usually say softdrink or the actual name of the soda we want.
Hey wait no mat did not give up Diet Coke he drank it in the hot ones video on this channel and that was in October 2020 so mat lied
AW ALL THE WAY GAT DIET ROOT BEER WHICH IS ALSO A SODA SO ITS A DIET SODA
Soda
Don't ask why, but where I am, we call is soft drink. I have no clue why xD I don't think I've ever heard anyone irl call soft drink 'pop'. Soda, yes. But not pop.
Where I live we call it fizzy juice
Well for me we call it Coke (I'm from Georgia - the piedmont area) and my favorite coke is Coke Zero haha 😂
Citric acid theory mat pat
As a Canadian, the ammount of times 'soda' was said in this video triggered me. We all say pop up North.
B
How did you get fountain Diet Cola? Because I want fountain Sprite because that crap hits different.
I say soda pop
in texas we call it soda
In Northern Central USA where Soda, except for Minisoda, it mess up us our rythm
I said soda im out in the midwest
I have always called it soda, even after living in the south for over a decade at this point, and I was born in Washington state. So I should call it pop, but call it soda.
I belive availability should have been on the soda check list. As you will not find Harris at restaurants, movie theaters and other outings.
I don't know what y'all got going on up in North Carolina calling it all coke but in South Carolina its usually just Soda, Soft Drink, or Fountain Drink. Most of the waitresses say something along the lines of "And what kind of soft drink can i getchya huney" (Make sure to draw out the honey as much as possible for the real southern charm)
I suggest Pepsi
I've always loved Big K's cola the best. A lot of their pop is amazing, actually.
my grandfather calls soda poison
I want burgers to jump on the citric acid band wagon 😂
“Shasta got the shaft” I need me girl like that bro
Did anyone see the glitching screen
This comment is for Las Vegas Theorists. Boylan bottling is now being served at SkinnyFats, it always was I just never new what was in there fountain dispenser. If there is any Theorists in Vegas check it out. 🥰
Me: Moves to NC MattPatt: Yes I am indeed in NC.... Me: Must find MattPatt
We call it soft drinks.. for some reason.👍
13:31 the camera glitched... ima screenshot and look around for clues
cOLd dRinK
I’ll have to check out my Fred Meyers!
NOOOOOO, NOT THE DIET COKE!!!!
FredMeyers sells the same one I think.
heh heh, boylen was 9th on the chart, but they said it was 7th on the vs. card
We ALL Pepsi is king of the regular, diet, zero, vanilla and cherry soda, cola, and pop.
What is with the seemingly random flashes of coloured lines?
Better see that new Harris teeter mini fridge mat! 🤗😉👌
My family lives right next to a Baker's, can't wait to test the theory! This was a really fun video :)
Bro it’s coke always down in Alabama
Coke. Clearly.   But I don't drink Cola ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Calling it all Coke is an insanity
I just click this video and i get a diet coke ad
when you live in Virginia and have gone to loodlion your entire life...
Pepsi
B
I say coke cuz I'm deep in the heart of Texas
Ahah wtf, they are sooo overreact for some diet soda
I thought mat and steph lived in cali?
Da hör ich ja familiäres outro  Krass *Alla*
13:29 hmm  edit: also maybe there is something about the capitalization in the description.
I was raised in a place where we say "Pop", but we would specify by brand name or flavor. I chose to switch to saying "Soda" or "Soda Pop" because I thought "Pop" should be for an action or a sound, lol. I also think "Soda" sounds a little more grown-up.
As someone living in the south, specifically Atlanta, I can say that I love _C O K E_ . Everytime I smell it...
Im from North Carolina and im so proud!!
Man please dont drink alot yes its amazing but my mother has kidney and liver close to failure she does also have light alcoholism so man i love your stuff and please dont ruin your endgame life with this
:0
*Impossible*
i'm other i call it vizzie
A.pop B.soda C.coke Answer SPRITE
The answer is yes, i call soda whatever comes to mind that day
A
I also enjoy diet coke but my fav is pepsi zero
I live by a Kroger i'll check it out
I am with steph. Coke Zero is literally the best!!!
Who are you and what did you do with the real matpat
C
How did i not know Matt lives in North Carolina
Watch out MatPat, Steph's going to become the superstar on your channels soon.  :-)  It's good you two were talking about sugar free drinks, because the two of you together is so sweet.
Use water instead!
Honestly i like the stop and shop brand diet coke the most
when is book theory
Steph! Try stevia with strawberry syrups or toppings, it's the only way I like it
pop
It's named pop for me because I've lived in the northeast pretty much my whole life.  but since I've been living in the Southwest for well over 15 years I've been catching myself saying soda quite often.
so from the rules there is about 4 different sodas
Wait to go NC, Food lion almost beat Pepsi  That is also from NC.
I actually thought Food Lion was national lmao
florida is a gmod RP server with no moderation
Hey diet coke, im leaving yoy for a nother soda. But human, what could they have that i possibly don't have? Better diet. Oh
Good boy switch to normal coke
In kansas the drink is usually called soda but growing up we called it soda pop
sees the title “no, impossible”
I live in New York and I mostly say Soda, who with me!
Send me some Harris Teeter!
Adam smith was talking about citric acid when he said invisible hand of the market
Food lion is in Virginia too xD
Ooohh.  At about 7min 10 seconds.  I spy Bundaberg Gingerbeer.  Best gingerbeer ever.  I drink it like MatPat drinks Diet Coke (note:  I'm Australian so it's probably much cheaper than in the US) Oh and for your survey:  D Softdrink
Fizzy drink, soda sometimes but most just the name of the drink
Why did I just look at a comment on one of your videos that said Plot twits: The reason why Matpat made this channel was because of he wants to get sponserd by Diet Coke LOL
*Mat pat and her  Rock rock rock rock rock  * god PICK SOMETHING!!!!! *Mat pat and her  Paper * god  Me admit🤬
Welp...we have Smith's stores out here in Southern Wyoming,  guess I'll try it!! 😉
I’ve never understood how Americans can drink so much soda. Like some people drink two or three a day. It’s always been a special occasion thing with everyone I know. Like when you go out to eat or go do something fun. People rarely have it stocked up in their house.
You can make a anime tournament arc titling the journey of Harris teeter
Food lion is also Easter here in Delaware and Maryland we have food lions every where
I love that this is slowly becoming a couple channel
B
It's definitely called pop
Put citrus in coke zero..?
sory 13:28
All diet soda is bad for you.
It's super weird and awesome that I live in the same place as the og theorist
I just realized, MAT is the only example for "Nerds drink diet coke"... AFTER ALL THESE 1.5 years!
I just call them soft drinks
film theory:  mattpat is gordon ramsay
did anyone catch the blip at 13:30
1:54 Mat:”My allegiance is with... Me:...the republic to democracy Mat:...the best possible option  Me:oh
Yes! Big K wins! Big K soda is the best pop, better than Coca Cola anyday, in my opinion.
YOOOOOO LETS GOOOOO I JUST QUIT COLA TOO
Just to be fair, I'm a root beer guy myself, so I gotta ask for a Root Beer bracket next.
Excuse me, canned coke always tastes the best fresh, how dare you pick fountain- gross
I live in SC (South Carolina) so I call it soda and coke, I kinda just go back and fourth
Title: i quit diet coke Me: IMPOSSIBLE...
Stephanie: "Confused cola drinking"
b
B
Biggest theory: MatPat has been kidnapped and he needs the original dedicated theorists to save him! No diet cola matpat for 2020? Seems SUS
Diet 7up it's the best and normal 7up
I say refresco instead of pop/soda/coke
DRINK BUBBL'R- THERE ARE LIKE 5 CALORIES AND 69MG OF CAFFEINE-   pitaya strawberry nect'r is the best flavor-  Edit: Now that I think about it, I don't know if it's available in North Carolina- Oof...
if there was another thing its that matpat wrote the boob song.
Welp, no Kroger owned stores for MN, so no Harris Teeter for me.
Harris Teeter for the win! NC represent!
in SC its both B and C
just like what jacksepticeye said the best coke the zero sugar
D: Soder Cola. Cause I grew up in the DC universe. I miss Big Belly Burger.
NO NO NO
All above
15:12 ....Ima fizzy person...
*MatPat Quits Diet Coke* Tommorrow**** *MatPat got sponsored of Diet Coke*
I live in Georgia U.S.A
I know its as Pop but that’s typical of Canada haha 🇨🇦
As Someone How is a COKE ZERO addict I am proud of Steph!!!
The Sweet 16
Harris, did. Did you just? Did you just, "beat" Coca-Cola? By accident?
If you don’t care about the amount of sugar CheerWine is a really great soda. It’s not cola flavored but still worth a try. It’s got like 40 grams of sugar though 😅
soda and all soda's
I need to stop watching tiktok i double tapped the youtube video thinking it would like it ok im not watchin tiktok till next thursday bad idea yes
This makes me want diet coke
I think I live close to you, that sounded creepy but lel
Food Lion was in Texas for a short while until the ABC news scandal pretty much ensured that no one here would shop there...
As someone that works at Walmart, I guess I can understand how diet Sam’s cola made it through round 1 cause we are almost always sold out. Also I call then soda
Pop
i'm a pop man, OHIO BORN
Decoding team what do the 4 green bars mean https://youtu.be/a5YAGYyuA0U?t=246
So I grew up in MS, where everyone says Coke for everything. BUT FOR SOME UTTERLY UNKNOWN REASON I GREW UP SAYING SODA.   Seriously—I have no idea why.
Matpat i think this is stupid but u should make a channel called book theory
what does seeded mean?
Harris teeter is owned and supplied by Kroger, so not really a local grocer anymore.
Have yall realised that there is some red and green lines in 8:09- 8:10
As a fellow North Carolinian seeing representation in stores like Harris teeter and food lion which I go to every week made me smile
now he goes to REAL COKE
Drinking water gang wya
Team Coke
I know we’re Ralph’s is and I think their diet is ok
This has nothing to do with Matt but I'm able to figure out Dr. Pepper suppliers by the taste...
Harris Teeter where's the sponsorship. Kroger get on this.
Btw here in Australia we just say sodapoparoodingarangarangahs
soda
*Gasps when sees title* Is matpat feeling ok!? H-he's q-quiting diet coke😨😨😨😨😱😱
Coke
Me watching this while drinking a diet coke: hmmmm...interesting
It’s all cokes lol
Jokes on you, we call it "coca" which is Spanish for "coke".
It's not just Cola, there are so many products out there you can buy for halve the price with the same and sometimes even better quality than the popular named ones. Granted, there are also times where I totally failed to find something better than the popular named product, but more often than not you just pay too much for your food.
I say soda
I'm doing an inner freak out that they are owned by Kroger because, in most Good Mythical Morning videos where Kroger is, Rhett and Link have proven that they really like Kroger.
I thought diet soda had a ingredient that is worse than sugar
"Which you probably never heard off"  Yet I live surrounded by them lmao  As a NC person, it's Soda all the way
did anybody see the camera glitch at 13:31
I got a diet coke ad before the vid lmao
Sparkling Water
I would recommend Diet Dr. Pepper, but even as a Dr. Pepper fan, I wouldn’t inflict that upon you
After this episode you should’ve had Badlands Chugs drink all of the leftover sods
Wisconsin calls it Soda
Me and matpat have the same first name
Soda, rhymes with Minnesota. Dunno what pop fans are on in the Midwest, but I respect it
I say,”Soda.”
Mmm Dr Pepper
When you open the can does it go "Soda" or "PoP"? Pop.
Soft drink, or soda
i love u, matthew patthew
A.  pop. Because here in the Midwest, if you leave it in the car during winter, it pops.
D: Soft drink
what's up with the random flashes, it must be something but I'm not sure what, there's multiple but one is around 13:30
You should've contacted L.A. beast about crystal Pepsi. He could've hooked you up with a new botle
Stevia is an a taste you have to earn I was forced into stevia by my parents but after 2 weeks i started to love it! I still use it in all drinks today.
Soda, but my friend says coke
Soda pop. Fizzy drink. Soda. Pop.
Food lion and Harris teter are every ware not just North Carolina
Matpat shock is priceless
wait north Carolina???? I thought he lived in CA
And exposing disney theories
Other soda pop
My mom actually worked for Food Lion in Tennessee for 20+ years, so seeing it appear on the list brought a bittersweet moment on for me.  It was much of my childhood, always being around the store whenever mom couldn't find a babysitter, but also it was a point of contention as she was unfairly fired for a health condition- she had surgery on her Achilles Tendon and needed a medical 'boot' in order to walk.  When she was told by her district manager that she couldn't wear it around the store, well her performance took a noticeable dip- as one who could barely walk would have had.  They then fired her for it- citing 'too many sick days/medical leave'.  She died from a heart attack in her sleep half a year before the class action lawsuit finished up in courts.  Side note: Food Lion lost.
The best cola is normal coke     I said cola not diet cola
YOU'RE FROM NC!!! DO CHEERWINE ON THIS CHANNEL AT SOME POINT!!!!!!!!!
Diet coke is literally more unhealthy than diet coke and it tastes worse with that god awful aspartame aftertaste.  But wait no it has "diet" in its name.
Wait, Matt lives in NC? I live in NC, too! I did not know that! Not sure how long you've been in the Tar Heel state, but glad to have you here, amigo!  I wonder what's his opinion on cheerwine...?
Food Theory? More like citric acid theory
I like how this one was longer than the crow one
I think Matpat started this whole channel to make this video.
I call it Coke
Harris Teeter coming in clutch!   Make sure you dress up before you go shopping there. (Especially on Sunday)
Soda
Diet coke makes me sick, but you do you Boo
Lol if coke would have ever just sponsored one episode this would have never happened :P
No it's not true
When the whole foods brand isn’t flavoured with stevia it’s wayyyy better lol
Idea for the next theory: crime theory
3:46 Turn on captions ;)
Soda
Coke
D) soft drinks?
When I was a kid, I argued with my Texan cousin about weather it's called "pop" or "soda"
Bout time. Diet coke is worse than normal coke.
B: soda
I nominate: Ninja Melk
It's like a drug addict trying to find another source
I hope matpat replaces his diet coke addiction for this episode!😊
I'm from Tennessee my family calls it pop however I absolutely hate it so I call it soda
Harris teeter diet cola was for sure the shonen protagonist of this tournament arc. It was bared from the tournament, only admitted because one competitor dropped out, went up against a rival so powerful it was almost a draw, and then unseated both the reigning champ but also coke zero who I guess could have been the crowd favorite.
im soda
Don’t run out of ideas now
How do I not have any of the Kroger retail chains near me 😂😂
Imagine they find out years later that the secret ingredient for the harris teeter coke is heroin
Citric acid and MSG: the flavors of our childhood.
I'm with Steph its all different types of coke
I love off brand soda! Although, I’m worried the prices will go up thanks to this video. 😂😱😥🥲😭
You moved?
b
Sorry Matt i'm a Pepsi fan. Nothing has ever changed that and nothin ever will.
I remember I accidentally drank a diet root beer I knew the difference immediately (lack of sugar taste)
Boylan's root beer and cream soda are really good. I know that much
Here in mexico, funny enough in the north, ppl call coke every soda. They ask for orange coke or fruits coke
U guys call it Coke? I call i Cocaine
Fun fact: this is the 2nd longest video in the entire channel  Edit: so far lol
Okay are we not gonna talk about how Matt and Steph kept tying in rock, paper, scissors??? Even after they briefly change their choice from rock to paper, they’re still tied! It is such a cute and hilarious couple moment. Really shows that they share the same brain cell. Wonder if they ended most of their competitions in a draw... 🤔
Publix gang
We state neighbors, I live in South Carolina 😀
Soda, but I respect them all.
Why tho. Why did u quit the elixir of life.
By the time I watch this, there are 69 thousand likes and 699 dislikes. Nice
Ooh can you do a fallout beverage episode? With the different flavoured Nuka-cola's, Vim and Sunset Sarsaparilla
I nearly had a heart attack reading the title
Shasta soda, a better target than a beverage!
Honestly I don't drink soda anymore but knowing that Dite Rite tastes that similar to a popular soda with aspartame is super helpful. Aspartame can cause HUGE problems with anti- depressants, meds for anxiety basically if you take meds to help with mental health you really need to NOT touch aspartame.
B, I’m from Oregon
Soda for sure
And diet coke hasn't sponsored matpat yet
Aldi's summit diet cola takes the cake for me. No idea if Matt has one near him.
easy any type of root beer
Listen matt i gotta say how did you not think the older one wasnt the one that tasted like cough syrup? Soda legit used to be medicine bro.
Matt-pat we have the same name
The nearest Kroger to hear is a town about 30 minutes away and the nearest Jay C is like an hour away. Next time I'm in the area I'll get some diet soda and see how I like it. :p  But I'm a Diet Dr. Pepper fan so I doubt I'll like it as much.
“...Stayed to their old roots and recipes while coke switched to corn syrup and plastic bottles”  And a suspicious, distinct lack of coke
Me, a Sprite fan, watching different kinds of 0-cal cola
I've seen Good Mythical Morning glitch yesterday, and Toast's vid today also got some glitch, and now the game theory?
This is what I live for. I would totally be a part of a soda taste-testing tournament. Personally, as a Texan I call it soda, and if I want a Coke, I ask for a Coke. As a side note, HEB here in Texas has some great store brand products.
nice window light mat
Why did you make an entire video about that tho, its like a proper youtube video was made for the topic of you changing or staying to diet coke. Couldn't that have stayed off-camera? I think so but a lot of people seem to appreciate the effort. It is a fun topic even though i think another video would've been a little more fun for both you and the people watching.
At 3:03 it glitched for me
D: Sodi
why does this seem like a war bwteen diet soda
20:23 I'm sorry did steph say what I think she said? 😂😂
Harris Teeter execs are taking notes.
March matness is all ready being used by the ncaa wrestling tournament
Is it just me or the vid is glitching sometimes?
1980s COKE o cola
Just have to say, not only is fountain the better version, but McDonald's fountain is the best fountain.
Soda.
bruh moment
pop I call it pop lol!
Here we call it, “Rootin tootin poppin bubbly wubbly hoppin droppin ice-cold awesome amazing super cool drinkin soda pop”
Pop all the way
I have always called it pop and will always. People who say soda throw me off a bit. But those who say "soda-pop" are something other worldy and not in a good way  No offence if you do say it tho
Omgggggg I live in north Carolina in roxboro!!! Lol
It's all coke!
Fred meyers is the same as kroger
the generic nutella (or "hazelnut spread" as they call it) at my local store is legit way better than actual nutella
you do know that diet is less healthy right?
I didn't know Food Lion existed outside of Virginia... I used to live in North Carolina and don't remember seeing one anywhere. Maybe it's because I was in a specific area in North Carolina, I dunno...
B
B
COKE PLEASE JUST SPONSOR MATPAT!!!!
TBH,.. I'm a pepsi person,.. but I was routing for Harris before pepsi even got out
When can we declare this dude god of youtube already
Excuse me? I call my “Soda” Partially Carbonated Sweetened Flavored Water thank you
STOP THE 🧢
ehhhhhhhh? Hes lost it.
FWIW, I know a guy that's deathly allergic to aspartame, so much so that someone spilled a Diet Coke that splashed on him and he developed contact dermatitis from it.
Are the green flashes my phone, video corruption, or an ARG starting up
My life is the man who was ran over
I use the term pop because I grew up in Ohio
I remember my old manager telling me that say for batteries, our store brand was made by Duracell when at the time if you took off the plastic packaging of both, they would fit together like a glove. Blank CDs and DVDs I've heard only come from a couple factories in China and Japan and one is better than the other. So I always felt the general shape of a bottle could lean to what main brand company is making the no name brands possibly but not proven. I would think space has to be saved somewhere by just having some major companies make the no name brand's items for them.
This one’s more like “That’s just a preference... aaa soda preference!”
Harris Teeter takes the win! Man am I glad that I live near two of them. (No joke, I live in NC)
In Utah, we say Soda, and we've got a lot of it.
This helps a lot because I am also quiting diet coke
You know diet soda is actually more unhealthy than regular soda cus the fake sugar is harder for your body to process so it ends up being an unhealthy substance in your body that needs a lot of energy to be broken down
Drinking Publix diet soda while watching this
See, here in this part of the midwest we call it Soda. Also we kind of drove Kroger out years back. Schnucks & Dierbergs are our local offerings.
B or D, in Pennsylvania they kind of just ask you what you want to drink, and then you say diet Pepsi because you’re a sane person, sometimes they’ll ask you if you want to soda, never Coke or pop though
In Alaska, it's called Soda or Soda-pop
Just so you know Matpat, I basically enjoy all your theories(yes the sans is Ness especially) because when I see you having fun in multiple ways(the crazy from FNAF and the fun/silly of Ness/Sans) it is just great😊
Yoooo. You live in NC? Isnt it great?
If you can, try Boost! It's a South Jersey cola flavored syrup you can add to club soda or water. It has a citric acid flavor to it and the company ships their bottles. Most people drink it in slushy form but I love it as a "flat soda"
Uh guys are we not gonna talk about the random color thing that happened at 13:31? Ik it's probably random but it's played so fast and is in a weird random place
Just drink water Matpat.
Definitely just call them sodas. I've tried to mend my ways to make myself call it pop, but it just never stuck. So sodas it is. Also that result is insane. I can't believe this is the same MatPat. Amazing.
Should've had a third judge Instead of a third drink. You just end up with the same results
D
wtf is pop like what name is that
Mat is like" Recommence the addiction."
13:31 weird distortion
dude nc is amazing. my childhood was based next to a food lion- never knew it was from nc!!! explains why i’ve never seen one outside the state. harris teeter is amazing. they have great apples.
I wonder how much money matt would have saved if he bought harris teeter all these year instead of diet coke
Ive been recently calling sodas "Chasers" jus to be funny n i mostly only drink soda when i drink(chasers/mixers), n some ppl get a kick outta it. But i know alcoholism is not a funny topic n i hope anyone struggling with addiction get the help they need
I'm more of a NOT diet cola myself but...you do you matpat...you do you...
Me(after reading the title):After all these years Change! In favourite beverage
Sop

A: Pop forever and always
RC Cola never gets the respect it deserves.
I’m c. Coke
that moment when your favorite actor breaks their character
I also follow Steph's train of thought in which Florida is not in fact a part of the Southeastern United States, its just different :V
Being from North Carolina, I was shocked to hear that my fav grocery stores are REGIONAL????
Did anybody else get the wierd green lines on their screen
yo can yall not scare me your game hints lmao
Is it just me, or does every Youtube video uploaded as of yesterday had some green glitch effects in them? You can see it on 8:09 , 9:42 , 22:53
I, like Steph, am from North Carolina. I also say "coke." And I did not know they didn't have Food Lions other places.
I'm just sitting here only now realizing that Food Lion and Harris Teeter are North Carolina exclusive
commenting at 5:47 *GO!!! Pepsi MAX!!!*
As a man who loves Shasta so much I do have to say that Shasta diet is so much worse than the normal. It’s just bad but all the other ones are pretty good
me after reading this title: YOU WHAT!
where i'm from we call all "sodas" cold drinks, so if you want a drink that is cold you have to say specially like water or lemon aid bc if you say cold drink we'll bring back a type of soda
U should eat livermush and prove how proud of a NC liver u r
“MatPat QUIT Diet Coke.” He QUIT drinking the “nectar of the Gods”? You don’t hear THIS every day. And by the way, happy St. Patrick’s Day!
Did he just say we've never heard of Food Lion? Pretty big store here in Georgia.
I picked Root Beer and I'll never leave
MatPat: "I just ingested twice my body weight in soda for your entertainment. How about a click of that subscribe button in return? Me: *You fool... I am 4+ parallel years ahead of you!*
IMPOSSIBLE
I LOVE Kroger’s diet cherry cola!!! So good!
Ok so learning they live in NC is mind blowing to me. I just assumed they lived in CA like everyone else
you would have loved dr pepper for the fruit
im a "sop"drink man myself
#1 you should have had opaque cups to prevent visual bias based on the appearance of the soda #2 no loser's bracket? we want to know which is the grossest one!
The one problem is that if this is a test for Mat's new drink of choice at home why are they testing fountain diet coke unless he has a fountain at home
B
I hear that diet soda was worse than regular soda.
Diet Coke has been quiet since this dropped
For the record zevia’s best pops are the orange and lemon lime
10:12 21st century? you do know  Pepsi Zero Sugar, is just Pepsi Max rebranded, which has been around since 1993 so not quite 21st century
What exactly is the difference between diet x and x zero?
Today I learned Food Lion is exclusive to the Carolinas.
D, we call it fizz where I'm from
Stay away from anything carbonated it'll give you stomach ulcers down the road
Dr Pepper or diet
Diet Pepsi is good too
Grew up in new jersey, live in florida now. Always, Always, Always have called it soda.
Soda
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE VIDEO BREAK UP AT 13:31? I'm kinda sus of it cause I went over that area quite a few times and I saw it every time. It might have been a mistake but I mean this is matpat so could it have been intentional?
I don’t ever refer to sodas that often, but if I do, I call it a “carbonated beverage”
I am pop
Just drink water, I only say that because no matter which cola you like in the end, they all still have water in them.
But like, for people who are in shape normal coke is healthier..
B
I grew up straight up in the middle of the midwest and we all call it "soda" and threaten to fight any heathen that call it "pop"
I can drive 4 hours and go from a place where it's usually called "soda" to a place where it's usually called "pop."  It's pretty nifty actually.  But yeah, all the southerners who just call everything Coke?  I can't wrap my head around that.
If those visuals are correct and aren't just an example we might have Harris Teter over here in the west.
From my knowledge of that one gingerpale video, sodas used to be medicinal so maybe that’s why the boylan tasted off
15:29 coke
Soda
Coke I live in south Carolina
Red bull
As a proud Floridaian I have never been asked what type of coke I want we call it soda to
Oh I definitely know of food lion just not in a good way. The store we went to had expired Boost and when we found out my mom went back there and pulled all of the expired Boost of the shelves and told the manager. The very next day they were all back in place so we never went there again.
We have food lion in Maryland, I didn't realize people have not heard of them.
Nookoooooooo keep Diet Coke
I pick D, soft drink. I think its because i am Australian, soda isn't used as much as the term soft drink
Soda and Pop can we put aside our differences and comprise on a nice Soda Pop or whatever, just not Coke what the actual heck who says Coke that's no just no
Is Food Lion really that uncommon? They are everywhere where I live.
the pop v soda thing has always kind of baffled me. We always just called it drink.
The biggest surprise is that Matpat lives in North Carolina. I honestly thought he lived in LA
I'm from Mississippi and it's just soda for me!
I go to north Carolina a lot, and u need to try the food lion brand root beer, it tastes exactly like a rootbeer float
Hearing that Harris-Teeter beats others makes sense to me especially after I heard H-T is part of Kroger's. The Big K store brand at Kroger I have found to be much better than many name brands (and at 79 cents a two liter bottle). My favorite is Big K's Diet Citrus Drop which is even better than regular Mountain Dew. I'll take that bet that the bottler of Harris-Teeter also bottles Big K.
B
We have all heard of Food Lion because of MrBeast
I saw the thumbnail clicked and said no you didn’t. Let’s see if I was right.
Diet Coke is the worst drink to ever exist
answer A! here in medina we call it pop. :)
Soft drink is what I hear people call it the most
my 2021 is to not drink any soda whatsoever, I haven't had any soda since the begging of February
14:40 Food Lion is everywhere on the east coast below the Mason Dixon Line. Also Diet Pepsi isn’t even a good soda so I am not surprised.
Hey I don't know if y'all have these outside of texas but y'all need to try diet buckie's cola also buckie's diet coke
I HAVE A SUGGESTION TO REPLACE DIET COKE:    regular coke
Who realized that Matt and Jimmy both live in the same state?  P.S. Jimmy, as in Mr.Beast
here in Eastern Canada, we say cola
are we looking at another ARG introduction @ 8:09?
I can confirm it is pop
About fucking time I’ve been yelling at my little brother Every time he gets a diet Coke I tell him it’s unhealthy but he gets it anyways because of game theory
Get this man some Irn-Bru
At the beginning you should’ve also brought some McDonald’s Diet Coke, it taste completely different than all of the other Diet Coke
you missed senku cola rip
The tragedy is that they discontinued Tab in 2020 due to poor sales.
POP
18:29 well this just turned into a telepathy Challenge

Top 10 anime betrayels
In a nasty custody battle currently. I want to thank you deeply for allowing me to forget about my situation for 20ish minutes. Nothing had accomplished this so far but Food Theory did.  Thank you.
Turns out they're sponsored by harris teeter...
Actually heard of Food Lion. One used to be here years ago, but it closed down in the 90s.  I was too young to think or investigate much about the store that was suddenly gone, and had a telephone game style answer of "explicit Instructions from corporate told them to just discount expired items, and they did this until it was obvious just looking at it, sparking an investigation and getting places shut down."  I also don't like inaccuracies and try to challenge my own biases, so I looked up the details. My local branch closed years after the actual controversy, and I was probably just misremembering the way my mother put why she didn't shop there or something. People reacting that way is part of why such allegations are a serious issue to companies.  The reality, according to Wikipedia, was ABC did an investigation and released footage of various unhealthy practices from employee-only areas. Like using nail polish to remove expiration dates from dairy products, repackaging expired meat, not following proper cleaning procedures, ETC. Food Lion didn't bother fighting the allegations, but did take them to court on easier charges for breaking the contracts they would need to have signed and duties they need to have agreed to to get into those areas as employees, and through the court case unearthed dozens of hours of footage where the ABC people tried to push employees into breaking proper procedure, and they didn't do it.  This has nothing to do with you or this video. I just got distracted and into doing a quick search for information on the Food Lion controversy after your comment made me think of it for the first time in years.
So with its citrus flavour, would it technically count as the limes and flavoured soda pops?
You called some of them the wrong seeds when they went head to head in the first round. Diet caf pepis was called 7th seed instead of 5 and I think you called another non 7th seed 7th seed as well.
Imagine trying to do like a 1v1 basketball tourney or something and you need to fill some extra spot so you grab a random kid off the street who looks like he's never even seen a basketball and then he just dominates everyone.
Harris Teeter POP OFF
Softdrink is common in my area
Have you ever try Mexican coca cola
Food theory Cococola = toilet cleaner  Specially toilet pot
Did anyone else actually misread the Diet Sams cola as Diet SANS cola right until MatPat narrated it for us?
MatPat after drinking a sip of Harris Teeter: "my whole life was a lie"
If only Matpat can have Ramún
I love Food Lion sodas. They should’ve had Chek too lol
I've never heard of Publix before and I live in VA... 8:10 uh... what was that flash?... 15:31 I say soda, all the way. 19:05 oh uhuh. Y'all got that vodo telepathy thing going on and I don't want to be bewitched...🙅🏾‍♀️😬🤣 I love how MatPat is like a foid critic while his wife is just sitting there like. "WHO DARE U DISRESPECT THE WAY!"🤣🤣🤣 I'll try the Harris Teater diet coke with some pizza on Sat. And tell u what i think.😊
A:pop
Pop in from Minnesota
Yeah In the Midwest we always called it pop, but whenever l go south every one says soda
i got fredmyres ill check plus diet is i tiny bit more healthy for you
Hearing food lion be described as unknown is weird because I didn’t know the rest of the US don’t have them
B. Soda
I may live in the south but I am a soda girl. I get irked when people call everything coke.
I totally thought you guys lived in California this entire time
This is an avenger's level threat.

NOOOOOOOOO WELL AT LEAST YOU GOT FOOD DONT YOU DARE QUIT THAT ELSE DAD IS COMJBG TO YOUR HOUSE MATTHEW PATTHEW
I knew Kroger would win in the end
Diets coke is like a beer. It’s acquired taste. It’s either you like or hate it
D. Other. Everything here is a "cold drink" but you pronounce it as "cold drank"
Did anyone see the colors at 13:30?
We have food lion in Tennessee
Who keeps comminting on there own comments
Mat pat or Matthew pat
Harris Teeter Cola shocks the world!
As a broke kid who could never afford name brand soda Kroger brand dr pepper is pretty fricking great
"Food lion, that you've probable never herd of." *Laughing in South Carolina hill billy accent* I ONLY BUY FROM FOOD LION, AND I LIVE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM IT!! HEHEHEHEHEHEEEEE
Florida is a fun mix of pop, soda, coke and a few other random terms. But my region just says soda
Just have rhaegar Coke
i dont blame you
Fun fact in rock paper scissors people are more likely to choose Rock if they're hesitating or under stress the most calm people typically choose paper scissors is for people who want to counter the calm people

Does anyone notice that at 13:31 or is it just my phone
The British people watching wondering what Pop and Soda are
just witnessed a chili ad with Dad in it... i’m disturbed yet intrigued
The moment Diet Pepsi was ousted I knew this was a sham!  Lol
I call it soda.
When I'm the weirdo that called it sodapop
It's all soda for my family, but idk about the other people in my town.
I feel like, if the Harris Teeter/Kroger cola gets big, I'm never gonna call it Kroger Cola, its gonna be Harris Teeter Cola
Let this be a lesson: If you have a big YouTuber advertising your product religiously for free, for years, and you refuse to give them a paid sponsorship to keep pushing your product, you will loose the advertising altogether. THE UNIVERSE HAS SPOKEN!

13:30  Green ting
Pop gang
Me seeing him not choose diet coke  👁👄👁 💦        💦
D in Australia we call it fizzy drink or just a drink
I’m pop
im pop cause im canadian Eh!
Is no one talking about the fact the vid kept glitching out
I’m pop and soda
Everything is a Coke and I’m from Ohio lol
Me: **sees Matt trying to replace Diet Coke** **Says while crying and smiling** So doomsday has finally come
There's nothing "Diet" with Coke, it's just artificial sugars and sweeteners in liquid carbonated form with various flavours added to the water.
Next Episode: The economics of each of the top four
I om hear
When it comes to non-diet soda, my favourite is Bec Cola, and a close second is Coca Cola Quebec Maple. Both are sweetened with maple syrup, and the former is certified organic both nationally in Canada and locally in Quebec.
amazing.
The Unknown rookie Harris Teeter Diet Cola climbs the ladder of the championship to best the all time, reigning champion, Diet Coke. Somebody make a movie about this, quick!
Look for Hamoud Boualem's Selecto. Im sure youll like it
watching this while drinking diet coke 😟👍
Stevia is actually really bad for you as the sucralose steals the spots of sugar receptors from real sugar , so now your body has a bunch of useless waste replacing valuable sugar. Also it's linked to cancer and a bunch of nasty stuff
You live in nc too? Do you like cheerwine? Would you have put diet cheerwine on the list if it wasnt cola flavor first
You have gotta do double elimination in a serious tournament

Yes I have heard of Food Lion we go down to North Carolina a few times every couple of years bc we have fam there so I am One of the few who is familiar
:( i always lliked calling matt coke consumer
Ok,tbh I can tell the difference from Diet Coke and regular Coke which I like,BECAUSE I HATE DIET COLA!!!!
please drink sprite
“I quit Diet Coke.”  I’m sorry, Matt. 😞
Why the video is glitching sometimes ?
I live in New York. born and raised. I am the only person I know who calls it all coke.
FYI: GMM favor the Kroger brands in their taste tests x > 80% of the time. Much love Theorists
MatPat: i CHOOSE to buy diet coke and now im having a hard time getting a new soda to drink. Dont know why i can only drink one soda but whatever  Me: ROOT BEER
Wow, Mat made the reverse choice? He actually went to NC rather than move away?
Soft drink
Kinda doesn't surprise me - in some "spot the name brand" taste-tests that they've done over on Good Mythical Morning, Kroger's house brand has done well.
I prefer tea.☕️
I go around asking for D.other
C-coke that’s what we say
Root beer and cream is life
Here in Oregon I’ve always heard it as soda
In the south(also in NC as well) its just coke or soda, pop is more of a northern/midwest thing. Even though I am a pepsi drinker whenever I go out to eat at restaurant(in the time before time) I just say coke.
i was choking on water because i ate to many takis and you start laughing the video ]
Here before, This video get's to be the most viewed video on this channel
we in da west coast most of us B
I love some Pepsi max...  I mean Pepsi zero sugar (it will always be Pepsi max in my heart!)
And I can confirm that your thumbnail haircut is amazing
Boylan's Birch Beer is the one true king of sodas.
C
I don’t know about everywhere else but I grew up calling “soda” tonic. I live in the New Hampshire by the way.
Why does Coke in a glass bottle taste better than not?
Oh cmon bepis max is the best
pop ALL THE WAY (hello from canada!!)
There's a glitch at 13:30 Just if anyone asking. Idk what it is but it is def weird
Because of this theory I'm going to try something iv been putting off for way to long. Switching to diet drinks. Should really help these couple pounds im trying to remove. It's not much but it should help. I'm just still not a big fan of diet soda.
I’ve actually had Kroger Dr Pepper called special k and it’s pretty good
Did Diet Coke ever end up sponsoring him?
You live in N. Carolina and your not drinking Cheerwine 24/7. You're an absolute fool.
me: sees title. me: OH GOD HE DID JJHGJHDGKJQDGQJGCJQGCJHGCJ!GCJ!
I am trying hard not to cry-- this is so sad 😭😭😭 I WANT A DIET COKE NOW
MatPat: Let me describe the flavor  Me: Yes describe it  MatPat: Not Good Me: ...
It's the twist ending for me. Best tournament arc I've seen in a while 🤟🏾
Matt: pop Stephanie: soda  Me: soft drink
Coke Zero gang
You should not have none what any of the bracket was
imagen saying soda instead of soft drink
In brazil Here is called "refrigerante" So yeah D
I'm that weird man in the middle of the Midwest who calls it soda, I am almost the only one who calls it soda except like 3 other people in my town(not including my immediate family), 😆
Zevia taste like sparkling water trying to hard
The extra little acid taste is why I prefer pepsi over coca cola. I've been known to add a little lemon juice to my coke sometimes. I kind of wish I could try out this Harris Teeter stuff...
Wait when did Matt move out of California?
Im pretty sure most of the U.S calls carbonated water with added flavoring, soda.
Man i need something like what matt and steph have. Reviewing colas together, thats love.
"I'll see you all, nec-"
I totally agree with the dont be afraid of store brand soda my favorite soda is my dew but publix brand mt dew is my go to
TBH i think it was unfair u used the fountain diet coke, as it introduces way more variables
GMM is on the Kroger bandwagon. Adam Ragusea got that Kroger sponsor.  Is Kroger...becoming our secret food overlords???
I've been raising using both soda and pop
what is that yellow frame at 13:30
he lied as naturally as he breathed.
This should be a series of just different soda pops being tried like mtn dews, Dr. Pepper's, etc.  (yes i say soda pop not soda not pop i realize i am insane i also say sody pop once questioned)
ok But none of those are canadian
I live far south but my family always called it soda, not coke, or pop.
NOOOOO you missed the collegiate staple of Dollar Tree soda!
what blasphemy is this?
C Coke
So... it has come to THIS!?
This video has given me the ability to commit something bad
Harris teeter is the ultimiate dark horse
The Underdog Harris Teeter WINS
Okay so as much as I'm glad MatPat found a drink he really really likes.. I'm also like this. "HOW DARE YOU, BETRAYAL"
I was raised calling it pop, and I'll die calling it pop.
NC for the wwwiiiinnnnnnnnnn
In Australia we call it 'soft drink' lol  Mum would call it 'lolly water' I think to try and discourage us from drinking it as kids.. but what kid wouldnt want Lolly Water!?
from the rock paper scissor, we know they are husband and wife.
IMPOSSIBLE
Soft drinks
@20:46 that expression on Steph's face... If he can turn his back on his relationship with Diet Coke for this new exotic cola... lol jk.
Coke Splenda is the best.
C
YEAHH NORTH CAROLINA
13:30 does any one see that glitch.
"In the southeast..... and Florida"      That's fair, honestly
soda and i live in tn
should have compared canned & bottled coke at the end, because i find it very hard to belive that you would keep 12 paper cups of fountain soda in the fridge over 12 cans/bottoles of any of the others
Baja blast or CoCo Rico
Diet Moxie has 0 Calories and is my personal favorite....although....a lot of people hate it.
Well I can only speak for me however, here in New York & more specifically the Bronx it's been soda all the time.
Me, an intellectual: fizzy drink
I expect MatPat to be drinking that Harris Teeter Cola in every video from now on. XD Also does he read comments?
I love Dr.pepper
All hail citric acid!!! 🙏
Traitor!!!!
I’ve heard of food lion... thanks mr beast
I'm 75% sure Kirkland and Krasdale are companies that use the same factory as well
I'm glad you said that about sources of soda, because I'll only drink Diet Coke from a soda fountain and Coke Zero from a can.
I’m C:Coke. I grew up in Alabama and moved to Georgia where they still call it Coke as well.
I have to agree with Matt Pat on folks in the South and how they discuss carbonated soft drinks. when my husband was still in the Navy he was stationed in Pensacola and me and our youngest went there with him, our absolute confusion for the first two weeks about everyone calling every type of soda Coke was epically confusing. Much worse for my husband when he went to Taco Bell several times and they asked him what type of Coke he wanted.. because Taco Bell uses Pepsi products which he hates, and he thought that magically Florida Taco bells offered Coke instead not realizing that's just what southern is referred to soda as.. you're not making it any easier on the rest of us Florida....
I live in north west, and its pop
I'm disappointed that Laura Lynn from Ingles didn't make it in this competition, though I doubt it would have landed very high on the list, just representin'!
I love Stephanie I just want to hug her she's adorable!
Rootbeer
C
I haven't had a Zevia cola in a long time, since I prefer the other Zevia flavors better. For sure the first time you try something sweetened with stevia it's going to taste off, but stick with it for a few days and you will probably stop noticing that and may actually prefer it over other zero calorie sweeteners. I know for me anything with Splenda in it is not likely to taste good to me.
I'm Southern and have never heard anyone refer to pop universally as "coke" 😄
I sense a disturbance in the force
Root Beer is godly, Barq's is amazing
Had to hunt through the comments to find someone else who calls these "Soft drinks"  Also, Food Acid 330 or E330 is Citric Acid, so it might be listed that way on labels. It's in the bottle of Pepsi Max right next to me.
B. Soda gang!
GUYS guys. I know it might not be available to you in NC, maybe not in the US, but green cola. It tastes just like the nuts, not too sweet not too acid, and it uses stevia. Dunno how zevia f*ed up but green cola is the greatest, and this is coming from a regular coca-cola lover (non diet I mean)
In Canada, we call it "pop".
How is FOUNTAIN the best diet coke?!? Can for the win!
Worst thing to hear (not for me)   "I'll have a coke"  "We only have pepsi"
I'm not even surprised, I first tried Kroger brand softdrinks when I moved down to Texas. I originally did it because I'm overly tight with my money, but purchased the store brand. I was so impressed, I get actively upset whenever my friends and family buy the name brand. Costs almost double, and it's just not as good.
that was fascinating, I'm a Pepsi zero sugar guy. you should do a food theory on the mystery behind citric acid though
The thumbnail caption: 🧢  You love it too much
Ive prefered my grocery stores generic dr peper for years now. Go generic!
Never thought I’d be so excited about trying Kroger brand diet cola.
Heretic
B. SODA
MatPat stops drinking diet coke........MATPAT NO! THE UNIVERSE WONT BE IN BALANCE!
I'm a coke girl, I just recently moved to Indiana and each time I'm shook by everyone saying pop, or my roommate calling coke a cola 'cola'. I get especially triggered by it for some reason.
Pop and coke
A: pop. I live in the midwest and my mom grew up here too. Though my dad is from the south and still to this day he gets confused when any of us call it pop.
Moutin dew you can dew. More therioes
has anyone noticed the weird green flash? or is it just my phone bugging out?
For the pop soda and coke thing I’m all the above, I use them all interchangeably,
Im Canadian so i say pop
I know its not available in North Carolina, but HEB bottles many of their own sodas and they are all just as good as their name brand counterparts. Even Dr. B is as good as Dr Pepper
I am sorry matpat
22:51 lol
Theres a glitch can’t blame you it happens
A
D/other: soda-pop (I’m from West Virginia not quite the north not quite the south not quite the east and not quite the Midwest)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
me, whos name is soda, watching the beginning: idk man im not that impressive
15:29  Me: Softdrink. Mah sis: WHEEZE
Soda. Also pepsie is bad. Gonna say it, atleast diet soda wise
Me: Avoids cola and soft drink products Also me: Interesting
Even tho I live in wv and over here they call it pop I still call it soda
Yeah, it took me years to get used to stevia, but once you get used to it, zevia ain't bad.
Dannnnnng MatPat lives in NC too? We’ve got a bunch of really great creators! 😅
D（ソフトドリンク)
Welcome to the east coast Matpat. Foodlions are ridiculously plentiful where I am. So much so I would suspect them to be MD or DE based, not NC.
Citric Acid is like the magic ingredient - Do Theory on this NOW!
Harris Teeter sponsor him
soda
Dew
The midwest is rather firmly pop territory, but I always choose to say soda, because the word applies more accurately than pop, but isn't inaccurately over-specific like Coke. Soda means soda, no more, no less.
B
I call it soda.
In Germany we call them „soft drinks“ :-)
I love it when we do MatPat lore
I love the Boylan red sodas and cream soda
Ok but all jokes aside, like I said, I work at harris teeter and yeah. Our company works with others and having worked at grocery stores that are tied with Kroger. They're all basically the same thing. They come from the same manufacturer and the only time It'll ever be different is if your item from Harris teeter has the word "Harris teeter traders" on it. It's a different manufacturer that mainly focuses on organic products. However like how Mat said in this video, the basic HT products are identical to other grocery stores since making them in one manufacturer keeps cost low. (Little side note, I got my MatPat jacket and I'm loving it)
It likely is.  You can taste a similar tang in their Cola Oh! flavor.  You could roll up to Indianapolis and come sample some.  Or I might be able to ship you a can or 2L for testing.
Solution: Sparkling Water
Interesting! (like what Stephanie said about coke being all sodas)  In the Netherlands we say cola as in soda, and then you need to be more specific on the type. Because if you say you want coke, people think you mean you want cocaine 😂
I didn't see any Kroger stores I am familiar with, do you know if there is a Kroger brand that is found in the Midwest (specifically Iowa?)
I saw like the two Harris Teeters that are near me
Do a theory on raya and the last dragon
a fucking grocery store brand just beat diet coke in matpat's mouth. thats insane.
Totally POP. Grew up in Ohio then moved to Florida where everything is soda.
Where’s Pepsi??
Pepsi tastes way better than diet Coke
Aussie and coke or fizzy drink. All cola is come tho
Harris Teeter's diet coke is exactly the same as Kroger's Big K diet cola (just checked, they have the exact same ingredients)
13:30 anybody else see an encoding glitch there?. The screen flashes colors. I bring it up because I saw a similar glitch in a different YouTube video earlier today... YT break something?
Cream sodaa
Looks like God has forsaken us.
BTW I’m coke to answer your question
Pop
Everyone likes an underdog story.
....I did not know that half of these were regional. Guess i don't get out of the south enough
Nuka Cola! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If this  more than 6 million views I won’t be disappointed just mad
This is the most terrifying video in all of film/game/food theory. This is just blaspheme
Me from NC knowing all these stores....
Do some research into Splenda. I personally believe it's a poison that should be illegal and is a cause of many health issues.
*Sees title* Now THIS is an Avengers level threat
Kroger’s version of Coke Zero is Big K Cola Oh!! I wonder if that is the same thing
that rock paper scissors match was a big cute moment
3:45  Turn on the subtitles and you will see😳
first of all this video should be the most liked on this channel
HEB brand diet cola is pretty good
As someone who had a soda stream for a good few years. The only good brand soda it has is orang sods
I recommend an actual cherry soda, like cherrywine
Given that coca cola isn't a great company, it's nice to see that matpat is looking for an alternative :)  Although I'm not sure if the company practices were his main reason to switch or not
Diet coke is bad for u stop drinking it drink coke Zero
glass bottled soda is best soda
Do you think companies force marketing employees to watch and take notes from videos like this?  I do.
Mat and Coca-Cola broke up
It’s all coke
I think wildwood cola is good but I don’t know if there are any berkot’s in North Carolina
Did anyone else has seen the "random" glitches?
If the whole point was to replace the diet coke that you buy (presumably for at-home consumption), why would you put the fountain option in? You didn't test the fountain options for any of the other items so this seems like a big error in your test methods.
Dr Pepper bro
C’man MatPat you gotta riot with the diet, you are ment to be with the nectar of the gods
Diet sodas are debatably more unhealthy than regular sodas due to the artificial flavorings.
I’ve been waiting for this for so long. If you’re gonna drink coke, please, just drink the normal stuff.
The fountain drink likly tastes stronger due to a slight difference in the syrup. Pop machines won't be as accurate as factory machines, so the amount of syrup is a little different.
Wait, wait, wait a second...If he's that close to a Harris Teeter, I might be much closer to MatPat than I thought lmao
PLEASE tell me if anyone else misheard mat at 3:46 ... *PLEASE*
Did you say wacky?
I OBJECT !! !!!!!! fountain diet coke is the worst imo... But a lot of these grocery store chains we have in virginia so this is helpful 👍🏻
Wait. Dr Pepper is a cola soda. 🤨
Tennesee has food lion also.
I don't even like coke but this was a good video.
I have a Kroger nearby, I may have to test that. However I'm more of an off-brand Diet Dr. Pepper and off-brand Coke Zero guy, namely the Walmart versions. So I'll have to compare the Kroger version to the Walmart versions.
MatPat should take Steph to Sunni Skies to try the cold sweat ice cream. It’s spicy ice cream they make in NC.
DP sounds good to me 👁👄👁
Just drink sparkling water or seltzer or whatever.
i never thought id see the day
I also have to say that a fountain soda's taste can change from location to location. McDonald's Diet Coke tastes different than Burger King's Diet Coke for example.
I just call of fizzled drinks "disgusting"
I don’t like the zevia cola but I love grape zevia and it is my favorite soda. Stevia is really only good for flavoring fruit flavored soda.
Anyone got the visual glitch in the videos??
I don't have Harris Teeter or any variation of where I live, but for the options I do have I go Coke Zero all the way.
Diet Rock Creek Cola.
dr pepper is god tier
I think Mat is crazy, he ditched his long life companion for something he got to fill in a slot on a little accident
Biggest anime betrayal.

PUBLIX.
Y'all didn't get Ingles, that will absolutely destroy your mouth, it's ROUGH.
why have soda when you can drink *T H I C K* water (yes it exists)
Is it just me or is there some green static sometimes in the video?
Pepsi
i actually grew up calling it soda-pop, but eventually just started saying soda around highschool lol, im mid-western
someone should introduce MatPat to IRN BRU and its diet varieties. Shame its not as easily accessed outside Scotland...
Yes!  QUIT DIET COKE.   The company wants you MATPAT to be less than what you were born with.
B: soda
The sun has set the stars dead the empire of diet coke now a sea of flames the dead now rise get ready for a new era
Is this just ad for diet cokes
i say both pop and soda
The real question:  Will you finally get that coveted diet cola sponsorship now?
To be completely fair, the drinks that had the fruit add-ins like Diet Cola with Lime were not allowed. So the fact that MatPat liked the local diet cola for having that fruity taste sort of negates the victory if you're willing to argue that even though it has the fruit flavor by default, it still has the arguably unfair advantage. We need a rematch between this cola and a similar Diet Coke (+fruit), just to be completely fair. I'd also argue that this competition would have been about 75% more scientific if they had used water or something as a pallet cleanser between tastes. Just swish it around then spit it out to clear the taste of other drinks out before doubling down. You never know if having one drink still on your tongue tainted the flavor of the next drink. I doubt the results would be altered too much, but I'm here for the science, damnit.
That was the most interesting twist. Ive been drinking Diet Coke from Fred Meyer for a long time due to its amazing taste and look and behold.
I call it soda, also I miss the days of more science matpat, to much lore videos. But the video was still great.
Ok, now redo the results using STV (Single Transferrable Vote).  Given that Diet Coke was both of your #2, but you swapped your #1 and #3 choices, I think Diet Coke wins with that method.  (Alternative voting systems is really more of a Game Theory -- real game theory, not videogame stuff -- kinda thing.)
Coke. Long live chaotic south! :3
I’m Soda
I can't drink diet soda, most artificial sweeteners with the exception of sucralose give me a headache
AWWW why'd you have to use Duke in the joke, it hurts me.
It's weird, when talking IRL I call it pop, cause I from Ohio, but while talking online to my other friends west of me, I call it soda......so weird. And I suppose this means I should try the pop/soda/coke whatevers from the store I work at, the store brand I mean. I do get an employee discount on brand products. May as well give it a try.
Blasphemy...
Harris teeter stocks after this video  Stonks
No it’s a hallmark of your channel
Soda
666 dislikes.
Also If theory's involve tasting multiple things you guys should really rinse your pallet in-between each taste test Otherwise you'll get screwed results
I dont have any of those stores near where I live .___.
It's Soda :D  Side note: You also have to remember that they drank FOUNTAIN Diet Coke in their testing. You can't always go grab a fountain Diet Coke for your on demand thirst fulfillment. It's most likely going to be cans and bottles.
I’m an A
Soda
13:51 16:26 meme this
As a South Carolinian, I can confirm that Harris Teeter and Food lion have surprisingly decent brand sodas.
From someone who lives in Ohio I hear pop all the time but I say Soda
My universe is shattered I need a minute to comprehend it
GT: Citric Acid is like the secret ingredient in everything! Also GT: citric acid secretly runs our world Me: yeah duh, that why Mtn is still increasing  in sales, and everything else is decreasing!
You drink too many diet coke more than eating *Dad's* Food lol
coke zero is so much better than diet coke
It's definitely Soda.
When are people gonna realize  chaloric density is not directly proportional  to healthiness or even to how it affects weight
As a kid I said "coke" for all soda, I dont know where I learned it, because all the adults would look at me so wierd, so then I learned to say "soda" instead
If you do any follow-up or similar episodes, I recommend doing blind taste tests all the way thru, only finding out the results at the very end. Similar to how MKBHD does his smart phone camera tests. It removes all implicit bias!
As far as Diet Rite, preferred the Tangerine
Soda
How is Dr.Pepper not a cola? I can’t tell the difference in flavor, though diet DP also sucks so it’s probably better it wasn’t included.
Dr. Pepper is a Coke product in the USA and a Pepsi product ion Canada isn't that silly.
I just don't know how good I'll feel entering ralph's and buying anything other than diet coke...
12:25 🇮🇹 italia
Harris Teeter 10 years later: Businesss is BOOMING
I'm from Florida and I call it soda, but a lot of kids from my hometown called it coke. It varies from region to region, even in the same city.
I'm impressed that not only this video is so long but that this vid has 66K likes and 666 dislikes at my time of watching
I call it soda
Is this true?
Stephanie mentions Florida.  Me: Ayyyyy
I see you putting in that ARG stuff again at 13:30... Sneaky hidden messages MatPat
As a Rootbeer Connoisseur, I can confirm that Boylan's is the WORST;  literally their "Rootbeer" is basically pure Pepto-Bismol 🤢🤮
I need to drive all across the country for the best Diet Coke? Wait a minute I already live in NC...
TRAITOR!
D ish. We call them soda and fountain drinks
A
Hey Matt before watching the vid Stewart’s orange cream soda
Haircut where is haircut!
My mother has been addicted to diet mountain dew for as long as I can remember
Midwest pop for the win!
Sodastream cola is DISGUSTING
it's soft drink or fizzy drink in Aus
I swear that college sports are bigger than normal sports in America
Food lion??? That’s the same logo as Delhaize???  Edit: I just googled it - Delhaize is Food Lion’s parent company
Diet Pepsi in a plastic bottle is distinctly good compared to other Pepsi products in my humble root beer loving opinion.
Mountain dew for me prefferably
Did you finally realize the chemicals and artificial suggars in diet drinks are worse for you most standard drinks?
What are the green flashes
As someone who lives in Canada, isn’t a huge fan of Diet Coke (I’m more of a ginger ale kinda guy), used to go to Montana and Idaho a lot (before covid), and has visited more states then provinces (it’s cuz I’ve only been to 2 provinces), let me say. Shasta cherry cola and fentamens is best coke, tho some ppl say fentamens tastes like booze?? I don’t drink so that’s kinda whack??😂
OMG THE DESLIKE SHOWS 666
We have food lion in Serbia if I can find it ill try it it's not reagional
I've been watching mat from the beginning, and I have never seen or heard that matpat loves diet coke
NO IRN BRU
I literally had zero idea Food Lion was NC based. As an NC native who's never left, I kinda just assumed everyone knew about it existing? EDIT: I mean leave as in move to live in a different state.
C
Soda
No diet RC Cola. I grow up in Ohio as well. I did called it pop until I read the  label of Crush and Sunkist ( both DR Pepper brands) and soda on the can. Sometime I called it soda-pop.
Matthew Pathew
I switch between calling it pop and soda to annoy people.  And sometimes I call everything coke except coke, which I call pepsi.  Again, to annoy people
I'm honestly stunned.
It's weird that mat thinks food lion is only in north Carolina
MatPat: I should know that my allegiance is to the best possible option. Later that day. ANAKIN MY ALLEGIANCE IS TO THE REPUBLIC TO DEMOCRACY!
Should have spent a few days between rounds to make taste buds neutral, and kept what sodas it was secret till the end.
Me when I see the title: "Earth just lost her best defender"
Florida we are Soda
The HEY EVERYONE WELCOME TO FOOD THEORY (etc.) Hits back Nostalgic Memory
I quit all soda. I just drink water. Only on special occasions do I actually order some Sprite or Fanta.
Here in Minnesota its soda
A :pop in Ohio
A random person approved of this video
I work at a Dillon's, I can confirm your theory Matpat, Kroger soda's are great and quite surprisingly better than the big name brands quite frequently
I hooked up with a Californian girl in the Philippines in early 2014 that resemble Stephanie so much, I can't help it.
I was told by my dentist that i also have to quit diet coke my tooth enamel has been D E S T R O Y E D over the years
You guys literally gave each other bias by reacting out loud before you drank them both
Where I grew up, any drink that came in the can was call a "cold drink." We didn't* really called it anything else
I’m pop being Canadian
NORTH CAROLINA HARRIS TEETER FOR THE WINNNN
Wow
Why do they keep referring to North Carolina as “southern” when the states not southern. I know it’s embarrassing to say you live in the North East and not the South, but except the truth, your not Southern. This comes from a native born Kentuckian by the way, so you know you can trust my judgment.
Good for your health..... not. Still taking unhealthy "sugary" drinks.... Pst, drink tea without sugar, it will help you curb that addiction.  D: Also, I would normally call these soft drinks "sugar". Try that too, you will drink much lesser when you say "let's have a sugar" instead of "let's have a coke/soda/pop"
"0 calories" quote on quote ZER0 hmmm weird
Wait.... MattPat's QUITTING DIET COKE?! WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATTPAT?!?!
Ever heard of a myth to not scoop honey with metal spoon?
I know a chinese peach soda that has 0 calories. You can get in online
I happen to know food lion as the store mrbeast bought all the groceries from like 5 times
everything thats not organic, clean (in the biblical sense), or made from animals that have been fed stuff that we shouldn't eat, like pigs, are bad for our health. Pigs eat everything and anything while goats only eat plants, our clothes and purses (which are made from plants and the purses made from hides of cows, snakes, and almost any other animal that as hide, even though most of the clothes we have now is made from plastic, where ever that came from...)
I am a D I love sprite
I like and recommend  Matpat  if you're reading This coffee trust me it tastes  Good and gives more energy Than any soda in the world
And I quit coke   If ya know what I mean
i live in the Midwest and its soda .
Wait... How did we not think of putting the sans head on the ness body in smash ultimate?
soda pop
You violated the law
Ohhhh those old school Faygo boxes begind the Boylan.... used to be able to get Faygo at sheetz around here in NC but they stopped carrying it.
We say it soda pop. Anyone else?
🧢
I call it pop.
Iced tea or maybe try milk tea :DD
after this video all harris teeters will be sold out of their diet cola
Is food lion not common in other states it is common in Maryland
Sorry - but I am a big diet soda hater. Sugar substitutes just taste awful (and while sugar is bad, most sugar substitutes might be as bad).  But I am aware of the health hazards - so I am drinking a lot of club soda - and just a bit of coke for the pleasure.  But in my book - Diet Coke drinkers are also eating small children (with melted American cheese)..
I've lived in NC and VA most of my life and I've only heard everyone call it soda. I've never heard them refer to everything as "coke".
Here in Florida, Publix is in every fricking corner.
All soda is coke here in Arkansas 😂
Idea hytale theories
Thank you mr. Matrick
D: In Australia it's called soft drink
WAIT!!! There are people who don't know what a food lion is?!?! HOW DO  YOU FIND YOUR CHINESE FOOD THEN?!?
8:10 any idea what that green flash was? I slowed the vid and managed to pause in it, but I couldn't find anything, ill be looking more into it
Thank you mr. Patthew
At 13:30 the screen sorta glitches and colors appear.
Humans were made for regular, ol' sugar cane or sugar beet. THE END.
I recommend... Regular. Aspartame is a common carcinogen found in diet sodas as a sweetener.
That's funny. This year's resolution for me is no soda
No Mat, it goes in this order:  1) He thinks Sans is Ness 2) He's the fnaf lore guy 3) He gave the pope Undertale 4) He's the Minecraft lore guy 5) He has a Diet Coke addiction
But why diet? They taste like fake sugar. It's awful.
All of the above: Pop, coke, and soda. It just depends who I'm around and who talking to.
How the flip (pun intended) did you manage to bottle flip a full bottle
Who else clicked because they were worried?
MatPat broke up with Diet Coke
"Impossible"
So I have an allergy to artificial sweeteners, not all of them, but enough to make me not even risk buying diet soda. aspertame, nucersweet, saccrine, all stuff I, or if I do in very very small quantities.
As a duke fan I like the joke
Did anyone else notice the green lines?
15:31  D: Beverage
Diet Dr Pepper Cream Soda, matpat. trust me.
10:42 Coke Zero Sugar great taste hint of added vanilla.
Just quit your sugar water all together. No need to make a video if you're just going keep doing it.
We have food lions in VA and their diet cola is soooo goooodd
matt pat (and poor steph) coke-snobs!
*This video has displeased Uncle Samsonite* Run.
Pop, Soda, Coke, or Other         SoftDrinks?
Here in my part of Maine we call it Soder
my uncle is the manager at that harris teeter mat went to lol
Grew up saying pop now saying soda
...what was that? 8:10
This is just so Mattpat can call his Diet Coke a business expense
Gasp! Diet Coke is your life MatPat, besides your family XD!
R.I.P Matpat's love for Diet Coke!
My life is a lie
I call it soda usually, but every now and then I happen to refer to it as pop without thinking.
Fnaf: *exists*                                       📈📈 Matpat: stonks 📈📈
But Matt. You put fountain soda, that you proved is better, against all these other "not fountain" sodas. I think that skews results....
E: diabeetus
POP!
Diet coke is likecthe worst pop
I really just watched a man decide his favorite soda...     Time well spent
This is very predictable the under dogs always win
Now imagine trying sugar sweetened cola vs high fructose sweetened, or glass vs plastic vs can vs fountain cola.  JUST a theory, but sugar sweetened tastes superior and glass bottles are superior to everything except maybe fountain.   Now if you added Dr Pepper into the mix, they go by flavor, not a recipe like the famous Coca-Cola secret recipe. But Dublin Texas had the only sugar sweetened Dr Pepper bottling plant until served with a lawsuit.  At least they still exist and continue glass bottling other flavors besides "Dr Pepper". Btw, you can order them online. *nudge MatPat*
North Carolina is the best state and Boylan cream soda would beat all of these
F in chat for zevia
diet coke trash coca cola 👑
Does anyone know what was going on with the green glitches in  4:06 8:10 9:43 13:31 22:52 (Tell me if I missed any)
Here in the NW, at the market we call it soda, at home we call it pop. In formal situations I call it the traditional name: soda-pop.
I call it Läsk
You should have kept the colas blinded until the very end.
Can you do more experiment?? I like those kind of videos than the fully animated one
I won't be surprised when the NCAA issues a takedown order for the March Madness stuff. Glad I got to watch it first, keep up the great work!
In Glasgow it's Ginger
The opening  reminded me of  shark tank
I sensed a disturbance in the force so I went to YouTube. I saw the title, I feel like I have seen something completely illegal.
Next month:  Coca Cola files for bankruptcy as their Diet Coke sales suddenly drop by 90%.
Everyday the titles get more clickbait
Diet Coke causes the depresso in the espresso my friends. Don’t drink to much Diet Coke
I'll always think it's weird that people say hypocrisy makes people's points less valid. Like, I have a massive sweet tooth and I am not about to say you should sit down and smash a bag of sweets.
I don’t say it anymore, but I prefer “soder pop”
E all
Splenda always gives me really bad gas
D water
In my country the regional term is "Fizzy drink" or "Fizz" bit I prefer the term soda personally
13:30 anyone else saw a flicker here?
Dear MatPat, TRY INDONESIAN DRINKS PLEEAAASSEEEE
What's with the random video static?
you do know that diet coke is worse than normal coke health wise
If your going to use the March Madness Bracket style you need to stay to it. The fact that the final round was a three way was dumb. Either way didn’t care much for this. Not really a theory.
B
We just call it what it is here Down Under, Fizzy drink.   What what fizzy drink would you like?  Covers everything and mean you don't have to ask as many questions.
O
15:30 D: other  Cocaine lol
Not surprised about the Coke choice at all. I'm a true Dr. Pepper fan, and a Coke-Cola fan second. Growing up we were a frugal family to make things meet, so store bought items become the go to. I drank too much coke to where I had to go Big K to make things meet. I honestly chose to enjoy Big K or HEB brand coke over a main label soda.
Diet coke: Ya da yada dada, it is GOOD DAY to be NOT DEAD MatPat: POW! You are dead! Diet coke: But why?????? MatPat: But that's just a theory, a FOOD THEORY, thanks for watching.
In Australia we call them soft drinks, and I've got mates in South Africa that call them cool drinks
“If life gives you citrus fruits, make a diet cola “-some random person
Like him not being addicted on diet cola is gonna last long.
this makes me proud to be part of NC
Ha. Yeah. WAIT WHAT
Pepsi is best soda.
3:44 Matpat: lets get WHAT
little dose matpat know... there is nothing better then diet coke... tho here in japan we have melon soda... it mite not sound good but its really good.
Jokes on you. I was just in NC and have been to a lot of these grocery stores. I had a neighbor who called it coke. A lot of my aunts and uncles say pop. I typically say soda but sometimes I’ll say pop.
Traitor!
citric acid is inevitable
Coke
One word faygo
Pain changes people
You know, we get Food Lion in South Carolina too. Never heard of Harris Teeter though.
I can’t believe you didn’t go to Kroger
Pop bc that's the sound it makes when it freezes which happens alot in Iowa
That rock paper scissor game has way too much couple energy.
Is it just me or when they tied for the 10000 time at rps did mat laugh cocaine??? check 19:01 in the video and tell me if im just crazy
Definitely say "pop" grew up saying it and it's too lat to change now
Too many weird green glitches in this theory to be coincidence. Somebody less lazy than me, decode this video.
A: Pop coming from the Midwest
What is the difference between coke zero and diet coke btw?
PLOT TWIST: matpat really likes Diet Coke more but switched because they never sponsored him after all these years
Matt, Dr. Pepper is a Cola
diet cola tournament arc...
Im distracted by how stunning Steph looks in this video
Sacrilege
we should give matpat RC Cola and also their weirdass commercial
Kick the cola to the curb, none are good for you & can cause weight gain
It’s funny that she called him Matthew because his real name is obviously Mattheus Patteus (MatPat for short)
Ireland is s fizzy drink land
Other.. all of the above (Pop/Soda/Coke)
Me:* looks at the title* “ impossible”
I prefer diet rc, but didn't see it represented, and no, it's not the same as diet rite.. With Pepsi zero as a close 2nd
And like everyone else off to the store to gets some coke
What other Texans want a Food Theory that pits Harris Teeter against HEB?
i was a die hard Coke drinker for the longest time but due to health issues i am not supposed to drink it. i am also unable to have aspartame as it causes me to have migraines. I fell in love with the Diet Coke with Splenda and the Diet Rite. I do prefer the Diet Rite as it reminds me of my all time favorite cola Royal Crown.
Two questions: First, is fountain coke not always awful? I'm amazed it was considered the best of the three, as it's always relatively flat, watery and bland in my experience.  Secondly, does Pepsi Max not exist in the USA? I'm personally convinced it's the most popular diet cola as it's always the first to sell out in stores if priced similarly. Again, that's anecdotal evidence at best.
i grew up with everything but mainly pop
Soda
Citrus acid is the rival of MSG
Senku cola
You quit? I AM SHOOKETH
i forget people out side of south carolina know what food lion is 😭😭😭 i have to explain what it is to my friends when i tell them i work there
Coke is called coke because coke is made out of coke
It can't be true
How did you guys cleanse your palates? That's a LOT of chemicals...
I'm a "pop" man, myself.
I love Food Lion's dr pepper.  I am "Pop" as I grew up in the mid-west
I learned one thing from this video. I need to try the food lion and Harris Teeter soda
I go with soda
Did anyone else see those glitches?
I’m just proud that my coke zero made it to the finals and Steph even picked it #cokezeroforlife
Just read the title. I don’t believe it.
Coke Zero better
I want the right way to say a fizzy drink Fizzy drink: I want the right one Soda: no the right way Pop: perfection
Here in Washington state it's pretty interchangeable from soda and pop. I say both. What about the rest of you, what do you say? Provide state or country, let's get a little science of our own going!
imagine your job is finding what soft drink is your favorite.
Bruh Matt only lives a single state away from me 😂 I'm too lazy to travel tho
I’m from Ohio, but have lived in Virginia basically my whole life, so I call it soda. I’m not far south enough for everything to be called coke.
soda
Steph should try Stevia in either coffee or tea. It might soften her opinion of it. (I’ll admit, Stevia has a distinct plant-like flavor, and it’s not a good flavor with most sodas)
I only drink soda when I get a root beer float.
Today i am glad to have heard of Food Lion.  I never thought id say that.
I forgot that matpat lived in NC now and got caught so off guard to hear them talking about nc and harris teeter and food lion
Why does the description have capital A's in MArch and MAdness?
Watching this when it's 7 hours old.

When food theory first launched i was kinda skeptical but I was very wrong and just binge watched every episode 😅
POV: if you don’t know what harris teeter is stick with Diet Coke
D
There are a couple frames that glitch green then revert just as quick the first I saw was the Diet Coke test for bottle fountain and can the second was the soda stream hmmmm
Food lion is also in South Carolina
Boylan's is absolutely best for if you want a sugared / non corn syrup soda. Not surprised their diet is bad. However Diet Pepsi is one of my go tos so what do I know.
Matpat: I quit Diet Coke. fanbase: [Press x for super nova level doubt].
MatPat: pls sponsor me coke! Coke: naw New MatPat: hmm I actually like this brand more AND it’s cheeped soooo Coke: NOOOO PLEASE WE WILL SPONSOR YOU NOW *says under breath* dang it Jeff you said we should make him wait >:C
Oh my lord diet coke is just about  MatPats logo. Now he's giving it up for this. This is... unexpected to say the least.
As a Michigander I have always called it pop unless it was made with actual soda water, only then is it a soda. My family does the same.
#Clickbait
I thought this day would never come-
What kind of ARG are you planning here? I sense something big coming towards us
Oh I love Cheerwine even if it's not officially a cola flavored drink (been to NC many times to visit family and they got me hooked). Also while Food Lion chain is down south they do have a cooperate brother Hannaford's is in the north as both are run by Delhaize America which I think means the store brands for these two might taste the same as well. I am happy to say I work at a Hannaford's store.
Canada: soda coke or soda-pop
Soda
In Nigeria, we just call them Minerals.
I am drinking a regular coke right now
Honestly I didn’t know people actually knew about coke life because I like it but don’t see it very often
I like that Stephanie was supposed to be the unbiased person but turned out to be more biased than Matthew
why does it say food theory in the tittle just saying
I'm pop
Having only ever lived on the south east coast, it feels very weird having you explain what Publix, Harris Teeter, and Food Lion are to people. And its Soda. Full stop
Aspartame was originally ant poison.(look it up)
I’m pop and soda
Soda
I wonder if Steph ever gets jealous of diet coke
Noone likes shasta
Me being grossed out that they share drinks just means that I don't love my husband
I’m glad you replaced your addiction with another addiction
Diet Pepsi is TRASH.
It is march eddness not march matness
In Australia its called "fizzy", "fizzy drink" or "soft drink"
This should’ve been sponsored by soda stream because I immediately started looking to buy it
May pat secretly drank Diet Coke during 2020 but hey that just a theory
is anyone else seeing the glitches in the video?? i isolated one around the 13:31 mark, its only there for one frame... are they doing more ARG stuff?
2:19 duke sucks unc for life
MatPat: I bet I can make 500,000 people watch me drink diet cola.
Am I the only one that is seeing glitches in this video??? Lol
First, C, it's all Coke. I answer Sprite to that question without a second thought. Second, we have Food Lion here in Virginia. I went there when I was younger for a flavored water thing they had that was very tasty. Third, citric addicts. That's the obvious joke.
I am an A type guy I call it Pop
No Diet Dr. Pepper? Diet Sunkist, Diet Variants?
No mathew pathew quits diet cola
This is HUGE!
A
D: Fizzy
I've worked on those factories and can confirm that the only difference on products of store brands and bigger ones is how much the quality department is willing to bend the rules
So..... did any one else keep seeing the glitches
I'm B. Soda, and I'm liven in Florida
I found out Kroger owned Harris Teeter about four months ago.  For the last three and a half years, I have had no idea why I couldn't register my phone number to my Harris Teeter card, and it was because I already had a Kroger card.
Purely because it sounds funny I call it bevvy but I also call it soda
Life is fucked
Seeing title:NANII!!!
OK sorry for being an idiot but I thought they lived in California. Not in MY STATE!!!
mexican recpies right now: BOSS THEY KNOW THEY FINALY KNOW NOW
B
My personal diet cola picks are Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Zero, and Coke Zero. Around here Diet Coke is way too inconsistent and I definitely don't enjoy it in cans. It's how I tried Diet Coke with Splenda and I'll tell you this... Blech.
D: Other (Fizzy Drink) This is just what we Australians call them...
you cant like harris teether for its fruity aftertaste when you said yourself we want pure cola no other flavoured bs
food theory: the krabby patty secret recipe is just a normal burger with citric acid
And moving to Dr Pepper. I've tried to quit soda countless times.. never works. Also, I HATE DIET SODA. I'd rather die.
Aspartame gives me migraines so the only diet soda I can have has Splenda
Hey you guys do remember that he's also known for Sans = Ness right?
ZEVIA!!!!!  <3
D. Other : Coca, but I had slowly changing to "refresco" because of how much time I spent with other spanish speaking nationalities that aren't México  Para los que hablen español, voten en respuesta a este comentario como le dicen ustedes A. Soda B. Refreso C. Coca D. Gaseosa E. Cola F. Otro
I can confirm that Kroger branded soda are the best.
Coke should have sponsored him when they had the chance
Soda and I only really LIKE rootbeer
Ayyyy
I'm only two minutes into the video, but I'm going to state my opinion now. Sam's Cola (regular) is just as good as Coke (regular). Personal opinion. I LOVE sam's when I can't get (or dont feel like spending the money on) regular coke.
I'm not sure on this but i think I've read somewhere that citric acid is used to balance the sweetness of sodas with their sour flavor. Its some kind of flavor enhancer I think
wow thats a lot of diet diabetes
Haven’t finished but the random glitches are freaking me out
Who else needs to suddenly go to Kroger?
This was just a excuse to drink Diet Cola’s
COKE! Everything is coke 😁 BTW - If y'all ever do taste tests again, don't forget to clean your palette in between.
Matpat: QUITS DIET COKE  All of us: **Hol’ up**
My parents just met a guy who exclusively drinks Diet Coke. No, actually. I’m not kidding. No water, just Diet Coke. And he’s done it for like 3 years.  I swear I’m not kidding.
I dislike stevia as a swettner too.
did he say beavier as in beverage heavier
There is a distinct lack of theory in this premise
despite being in the midwest, my family said 'soda'..made my grocery store boss mad cuz everyone else said pop
Diet dr pepper
In mexico everything is coke/ what type of coke
Dad's soda drink is Diet Dr.Pepper.  At least where I live anyway.
Food lion is in kentucky as well
I’m team pop (raised in us north East)  I love that steph is a dime piece, gives us other nerds hope of finding love.
8:08 Glitch
Do you mean Pepsi MAX when you say Pepsi zero
i used to think that soda was a type of coke, not that coke was a type of soda lol
I wonder how many bathroom breaks they had to take
9:37 bruh
Am i supposed to be looking for a secret at 4:06?
YOOO BOYLAN IS THE BESTTTT LOVE THEIR CREAM / CREME SODA, AS WELL AS VIRGILS CREAM SODA. Never had their cola though, and maybe that's a good thing, haha!
Diet Pepsi> Coca-Cola
Honestly, I Prefer dr. Pepper
Just drink tea
I live in Charlottesville va so this weekend I’ll go to Harris teeter and Kroger and update yall
30 seconds in and this looks in healthy
I am from the south and I know not a soul who calls a carbonated syrupy flavored drink "pop". Down here you either drink a Coke or a Soda. More commonly a "Coke". It's as common as calling a plaster bandage a "Band-Aid".
I’ve been to food lion and it stinks the first time u go in there
rip mats teeth
Title: I quit Diet coke. Me: Ha, yeah right.
I am soda
try guarana, a brasilian soda, based on one of our best national fruits
We say soda where I live. I'm in south Louisiana. We have our own seperate southern accent from the rest of the south
Coke Zero is where it’s at
Here in Ireland we all call them fizzies or fizzy drinks
This is literally an excuse for Mat to drink something that is but isnt diet coke And Yes even the Panera Bread Glove episode its another one of his excuses
Well we need to contact Harris teeter to sponsor food theory
8:09 9:40 13:30 22:50 ???
I never thought a game of rock-paper-scissors could be so intense.
Diet coke has an extreme amount kf caffeine to make you addicted
“He gave up Diet Coke for the entire year of 2020”  5 months ago (the hot ones vid): you sure about that😐😐
Now I'm here waiting for his relapse
You missed buying the syrup from a supplier, and running it through a Sodastream...
What a crazy coincidence, I moved to South Carolina a year ago from California and didn't know Harris Teeter existed until last weekend when I needed a grocery store asap.
Pop gang
YOUR CAMERA IS DYING. THERE are green lines showing through portions of your video at 13:25 - :13:32   Look into this Matt.
Never thought I’d watch a video about a grown man losing his shxt over his favorite soda but here I am
Matpat thinks I don't know what a Food Lion is 😆. I grew up going to Food Lion
Virgil's Zero Sugar or Jones Diet Cola would be a great choice.
everything is coke nothing else  Dr Pepper is the best coke
15:16 No one in Ohio calls it pop Matt. Ohio is a soda State now.
Blasphemy!!
Am I the only one thought they should've done a blind taste test?
Those mat and stef mind connected
Can we all take a moment of silence for diet coke?
in the netherlands store brand beer often comes from the same factories as big brands. so if you know wich one is wich you can buy your favorite beer brand cheaper
C
As weird as it seems, as a thirteen year old boy, I really love Diet Coke
Mat: are you "pop" or "soda"  Me: yes.
COKE ZERO
If you are ever in Germany or even the city of Hamburg you need to try Fritz-Kola, it just has a more fresh and less "sticky" taste with even more caffeine
b
Yeah if there s a kroger I'm your soros stl krogerles
I've been all over. So my family really never had a singular word for all carbonated drinks. Sometimes we call it soda, usually if it's a non-cola, sometimes it's pop, but usually we just name the product.
I want to see a theory about citric acid now 😂😂
Soda
Can we talk about the seed numbers? Is it a code? Because they were definitely not right...
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo as a fellow coke addict I am disappointed in losing a fellow brother. I shall hold a vigil for you Mat
Is it weird that I only want to try the awful ones?
clear american is good
Fountain drinks at McDonald's coke has a deal were they get a special blend for them alone.
This dude just dumped Diet Coke
He should make an episode of the karby patie
dont drink soda
That is very interesting that citric acid changes the taste so dramatically for you. might keep an eye on my food stores for that.
Pop. I'm from Indiana.
We have food lion outside of NC
Cries in Pepsi max
4:06 has green bars that flash on the screen. My theorist brain is confused. Witch is the same of saying its curious. Hmmmmm... If this is just some compiling error I prefer to think that it is not.
I can't believe that you didn't have some form of South Eastern Grocers (SEG) Chek Colas. Sold all through the south at Winn-Dixie, Harvey's, Bi Lol, and Fresco Y Mas. They have some of the best sodas. Personally I love thier mountain dew style soda called Kountry Mist and they used to have the undisputed best version of mountain dew code red, Chek Red Alert. Rip Chek Red Alert.
Mathew:I gave up Diet Coke   Every fan of food theory: “slaps face”
Aw I was hoping for some facts about why its bad for you
Jokes on you I don't even like soda
I had a mini panic attack when I read “I quit.”
That rock paper scissors shows just how in sync Mat and Steph are
Soda!!
root bear is best
REGULAR COKE GOSH DARNIT
*Sad San Antonio noises*    Kroger was exiled, it's only HEB Now
It’s sad MatPat doesn’t live in Texas, because HEB brand sodas are DELICIOUS
B:Soda
17:58 Nope... juste, no.
I audibly gasped when I saw the title
Try root beer zero shugar
Boylans creme soda is really good, I recommend.
Most generic store brand food and drink is better than the big brands from my experience and cheaper too!
In the Philippines the household brand was Coke, so it was our word for all kinds of soda. That said, I am surprised that there are so many kinds of diet soda out there lol.
Soda
I keep forgetting and being reminded that Mat is in North Carolina, wonderful surprise, him and MrBeast
Not throwing any shade but stress is showing, guys.  Always keep being healthy 😇
Please go in more detail of this soda specialty shop! Im curious!
Do defend boilin, original cokeacola had coke.and was a medicine, if they never change recipe, it makes.sense it taste likes meds
As my family says, you can tell those two are married...
The"1 cup" looks like plankton from spongebob.
Typo: sodastream should be number 9
The look on Stephanie's face when Matt chooses the Harris Teeter diet cola is priceless.
Now we know that matpat lives in Asheville NC
This is do sad
13:30 is that a hidden message or just a glitch?
I'm not the biggest fan of cola's It's all about the Citrus flavours
I love Diet Coke thank you!!!!
20:53 Stephanie’s face should be the new PogChamp.
Ok, so, what in the world is with all the glitches in this video?

Food Theory: MatPat stops drinking diet coke Me: oh its this years april fools joke My calendar: nah 2 weeks early for that Me: *visible confusion*
Good for you 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
I drink Coke Zero and Mexican Cola now.
I literally haven't drank soda in over a year. Why am i watching this.... Because mat Pat🤣
What about regular coke?? You should try that one
If you call it anything other than soda, you are wrong.  However, any and all colas are Coke.  Yes, even Pepsi.
Breaking news: Coca Cola stock goes down by 25% for unknown reasons
I bought the frys diet soda and im shook. Yo you can't taste it and its soo yummmy
I'm sad cause Kroger is only in the united states so I can't have the soda :(
So private labels are  like the ghost kitchens for mr. Beast lol
I never thought id see the day
I live in west Virginia and we have a food lion
to see MattPat do a theory on a drink he loves so much... it sparks much joy. <3
que cagado
Soda
Soda/ pop I was born in Texas I'm being raised in Minnesota
matpat: i quit diet coke all of humanity: F in chat hes doing a video about how he got diabetes
Soda
In Australia we just call it either soft drink or just the name of the drink
If Matpat knows anything about Ohio (which is where he grew up) we only say pop if you say soda or cola you will be eaten alive.
Soda
Here in Malaysia or at least in Sabah we just call it... "Minuman gas" which literally translate to gassy drink. Hahaha- HOWEVER , most of the time we just say the exact name of the brand other than just pop or soda.
Oh my god
the show that over complicate things
Please food lion is in TN as well
coke zero sugar>>>>>>
Me living in south Carolina having all these North Carolina based stores: 👁👄👁
13:30 any1 see it
I love publix.
Where's the RC? Best cola, IMO.
Other couples: fights for things not done certain way Mat and Steph: “no this drink is better!!!!”
I don't know if a diet version exist, but the best soda is a Russian drink called Baikal.
B: soda
The original coke probally won but i dont know yet
Anyone call it a Fizzy?
D  I call it fizzy juice lmao
"let the diet coke off begin" ?? sounds like something charlie sheen would say xD and by diet im guessing its cut with aspartame...
Where you see "mat" in matness i see "ness"!! Jk i love that episode
MatPat is shookith.
D. here in SoCal its "soft drink" which makes absolutely no sense at all since soda is bubbly burny, not soft
Diet Pepsi kinda trash  Edit: Nvm, Diet Pepsi REALLY trash!
Boulans birch beer and creamy red birch beers are my favorite sodas.
Nooooooooooo(I just read the title I have watched a single second)
If you were based in Australia I’d recommend the Royal Crown Draft Cola. That stuff is perfect and goes down really smoothly, plus it has a bit of a caramel aftertaste to it but it’s really subtle
I work for Kroger (Food4Less) and out of all our sodas at my location, Big K is the best selling store brand soda we carry. But Red Cream Soda is my favorite 😋
I only drink dr pepper, the rest don't have the kick I like
You should try Wild Bills Soda.
finally you quit that stuff is not good for you
"Bloke Coke, give it to me" - Steph 20:23
I really loved this style of video, I hope they do this with like vegan meats, or other diet foods or something
Matpat this is illegal
Ok Matt, Foul on the court! You cannot compare fountain soda to bottle! Fountain Soda is mixed to account for ice melt, meaning that you are basically drinking double syrup diet coke. Unless you are running to the 7-11 everytime you want a soda, you are not looking at an honest comparison. Only packaged to be drunk straight is a fair comparison. Really Matt, I am shocked that you had such shoddy science in this episode!
Diet soda ain’t the only thing his wife gonna be tasting tonight
Wait, did mat move to NC? I'm confused
Steph and MatPat are actually so sweet, this video had me so invested and I don’t even like Diet Coke 😭😂
B: Soda
soda pop
4:05 to 4:06 - Screen glitch or ARG start?
Random solid green frame at 8:10  This was jarring and I don't know if it was an accident or a plant.
Guess I'm gonna have to try Harris Teeter's soda the next time I visit my brother in Virginia

Good thing they stopped that rock paper scissors match, we know what would happen if they tied 100 times

13:30 Is interesting. Seems something is hidden here.
Coke. Proud southerner.
That's a lot of Diet Coke
yeah stevia is very hard to get used to, i have used it for a healthy diet tho and i haven't gotten sick in like 3 years

Hey Matt! You should do a theory on MSG! I think you and Steph would have a blast looking into it.
you forgot Albertsons/Safeway signature select diet soda and Smiths/Kroger diet soda as well
I just realized how Canadian these guys sound
Boyland root beer is the best!!
me am soda
I am never tried Diet Coke in my life I never will
Ah yes,me who hates carbonated beverages: Interesting
MatPat: "We here in the Midwest call it pop!"  Me, a Wisconsinite: "Excuse you, this beverage is soda and nothing else."
As a North Carolinian who has worked for Harris Teeter in the past, I refuse to set foot in those stores ever again. I hate that company so much.

Next episode on My Strange Addiction
ITS CALLED A COKE, NOT POP
YES THERES A FOOD4LESS NEAR ME LETS GOOOOOOOO (none of the others are in canada)
I’m very curious about how you did the fountain pop. Because over time, the flavour of pop will change as it degasses. Fountain pop usually degasses a lot faster than pop kept in a bottle or a can because it does not keep the pop under pressure. So if you used the same source for the fountain pop throughout the tests, there is potential that the fountain pop was better at the beginning than at the end.
it's no secret that Coke purposely delivers & sprays out extra syrup for fountain machines, especially McD's if you happened to get it there
Wait, what?  No RC (Royal Crown) cola, but small regional bottlers like Johnny Ryan???
This is just a cola ad
As a diet Coke fanatic myself, highly recommend trying caffeine free diet Coke it’s even better than regular diet Coke
nice they pick food lion and harris teeter.
Diet drinks is not good for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lesson learned: Always root for the underdog.
Diet Coke yay! :) I hate stevia and I am allergic to splenda so NutraSweet is the only thing left to me since I can't have sugar for my health. I drink Dr. Pepper :)

I'd never thought I'd see the day where MatPat quits Diet Coke  😭😭😭😭
I live in America and we just call it water.
Woohoo! Matt switches to store brand. Saves hundreds of dollars a year to spend on making more videos for us! 😁👍

mat pat: "I quit diet coke" everyone: impossible also i pick awnser B, I call it soda
Wait, wait.. this is a coded cry for help by MatPat that he's being held hostage against his will! Theorists ASSEMBLE!

yeah hes not getting that diet coke sponser
Floridian here. It’s soda not the other crap. Food Lion was here in Florida when I was a child (for reference I’m 33 atm) but they just slowly disappeared by the time I was 11 or 12.
Matpat: i quit diet coke  Everyone: **Impossible**

Anyone here notices anything strange with the glitches in the video every now and then?  Does it spell out something?
Soda or Fizzy, honestly
Try crack cocaine it's better than normal diet coke :)

Shasta is my favorite brand, it has such a great natural flavor. I've never tried their diet stuff though, but their regular cola is amazing
This is proof that anything can be interesting if you take it seriously enough.
no the meme cant die
Let's get a series going for other flavors
What an underdog story
Post the ingredient list
I'm soda
Me who lives in sc and says I’ve never heard of food lion “are we a joke to you”
I'm allergic to citrus fruits, and citric acids. I was recently breaking out in rashes at work and couldn't figure out why until I checked the ingredients in the mop soap. It had citric acid at the very end of the list. As soon as I stopped mopping, I stopped getting rashes. I also can't eat a lot of fruits without getting blisters in my mouth and throat and on my tongue. Not very fun.
4:05
DIET COOOOKE !!!    assemble...
Matpat come on, did y'all actually choose fountain coke over bottled or can
pop up here in canada
Him : I quit Diet Coke  Me a diabetic : one can only *D R E A M*
I have never called it “pop”, “soda” all the way.
Good on you for trying something new and coming out with an alternative! I personally don't like the taste of alternative sweeteners so any diet soda is awful to me, I prefer water, second by a few sodas (most of them I don't like)
Fountain Drink or just Soda
I still can't belive that matpat chose something over diet coke.
I have always said soda, but my parents say pop.
good job, diabetes is gone..... until i noticed you are testing new soda's
I’m using this for my March madness bracket
Guys at some parts for me there are green lines that appear on my video
Zevia is a great choice for people like me, who are on dialysis. It has less potassium, phosphorus, and sodium, which are all things you have to monitor with kidney failure. It doesn't taste as great as regular soda, but it's a nice substitute.
4:04
Mat theres new security breach things you need to talk about because someone already made a few connections from security breach to sister location. Looks like chica got scooped in one, ballora’s music box in the background.
I call it pop go midwest
Except for their cream soda, Boylan's other sodas that I've tried ain't great. I've had their root beer and it's also described as "medicinal." I don't know how to describe the cherry soda, but I don't care for it plain, it's better if you mix it with something else to make a cherry flavored soda like Dr. Pepper or other colas.
Citric acid has taken control of our world. Now the question remains. Is it the cure to cancer.
Oddly enough I drink Coke Zero about like MatPat drinks Diet Coke, though my preference is actually Pepsi Zero, it's just harder to find on a regular basis. Especially in the little tiny bottle form I prefer lol   But, I'm from the very deep South. The Gulf Coast, about an hour from New Orleans. I've gotten the Zevia one from Rouse's and I too had high hopes for it and it's just awful lol I'm convinced Stevia is not meant to be consumed by humans lol.  But anyway, while I grew up calling everything Coke, I forcibly broke myself of the habit because I got annoyed at a brand loyalty I don't even actually have, so I forced myself to start saying Soda instead lol.
I am honestly proud of how few drug jokes there are here. Good job internet!
You know the death count Hercules wins with the count the kills shows
As a native born North Carolinian (who has been living in NYC for 12 years), I miss Harris Teeter, they have good food items! I'm sure if the Harris Teeter/Kroger executives/owners were to watch this, they will be Wookie screaming!
Lets go NC viewers!
Shasta offered in most EMS rooms! At least around me! 🤣👍 Faygo diet is pretty good!
When I saw this title my reaction was a audible gasp.
Glitch at 8:10 ?
9:15 when matt mispronounced Stevia first
So I now have to ask my friends in AZ to grab diet soda from Fry's to compare ingredients with Harris Teeter. However, I think you need to compare niche sodas together with sugar (not sugar-free/ zero sugar) like Boylan, Cheerwine, but also a convention favorite- Wild Bill's Soda. Then compare their cola/ soda flavor.  Also, I grew up in the Mid-Atlantic/ DC metro area I mostly say soda or coke. However, my dad is from the Midwest will fall back to "pop" when he talks to his sister.
NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Barilla uses bronze dies to cut their pasta, giving it microscopic little ridges, making sauce stick better than cheaper pasta extruded in stainless steel or plastic rollers that result in a smooth pasta that sauce slides off of.  Always opt for bronze-die pasta.

Wait are food lion and Harris teeter only in the south?
My brain what's happening is it real reality is crumbeling
I need immediate backup, this man is straying to far from Diet coke  *I NEED BACKUP RIGHT NOW*

Pop? Sofa? Coke? Psh... here in good ol’ kiwi land we call it fizzy
If you have it, NOTHING beats Hansen's soda. They use sucralose instead of aspartame which tastes a lot better.
indirect kisses uwu
Matt sounds like he’s about to cry every single time he speaks.
I was devastated when they said they didn't like Zevia - I swear by the stuff, it's the only soda brand I drink now. Granted, it was my only option when I went keto, but even when I go off keto for the occasional cheat week, I don't drink other sodas. I will admit that it takes some adjustment, you have to get used to it, but for me, a girl who used to chug full-sugar soda and juice and scorn the very idea of ingesting plain water, it didn't take TOO long to get used to it, I don't remember ever actually hating Zevia soda. And they have so many flavors! I'm really sad Zevia got knocked out right off the bat, I legit freaked when I saw Zevia was in the running…
The one time I ever met MatPat in person, I was working at Disneyland and he bought a Diet Coke from my cart and I was like “...the legends are true!!”
What about RC cola??!?!?!?
big fan
I call it soda uhhhhh
I work for Kroger I’m going to have to try this
you didn't have a olipop
soda is not good for you
I’m soda
D: Other. Around here we call them "Refri" or "Refrigerante".
I used to be a Diet Coke fiend too. everynight in highschool junior year to help me on math. Now i dont like the taste that much, but it brings me back to those days and I love that. also its super addictive.
The first second of this video THUMBNAIL i was immediately summoned in a different universe where matpat quits diet coke in 5 in 10000 futures
I don't understand, Mat said that the drinks have to taste like Coke-a-Cola and then showed a picture of diet Pepsi..? Pepsi does not taste like Coke, they have very different, distinct flavors. Or at least, to me..
Should have put the round with clear soda into a not clear cup.
I think it's adorable that Stephanie exclusively calls him the full "Matthew"
Note: just because something is prohibited or restricted, it doesn't mean it's bad.
Soda always
Why it’s all poison
I work for Kroger at QFC. I am definitely going to check the ingredient label for our Private Selection cola for Citric Acid.
Child murder is to Game theory as Citric Acid is to Food theory
Ok, i am at 6 minutes and i just have to say why is coke getting some special treatment here and not pepsi? pepsi comes in fountain as well.
I would rather watch YouTube ads than to watch this guy. Glad it's a few country
When something tastes bad you have to take another drink just to make sure it is that bad.
I am a combination of B and C
FYI MatPat, Kroger owns Fred Meyer too
Never clicked on a video faster.

Water gang rise up
Ohhhhh you live in North Carolina I was close with Massacusetts
A: pop but sometime B: soda
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Neat!
I prefer coke better than Pepsi
Part of reason for my recent citric acid purchase was because of food theory.   I'm going to use it in so many recipes and maybe sometimes just use it like sour candy to be honest.
IMPOSSIBLE, PatMat MatPat exicuted Diet Coke
Its fizzy cancer juice, and anyone that calls it anything else is just wrong. Anyway I'm gonna go get a 5th root beer.
I say pop
While i love how much everyone is enjoying the video, don't forget, Dad got Matpat. We need to make sure we are paying very close attention to detail to his videos, he may be asking for help via secret messages. Something as simple as the screen glitch at 13:31 of this video could help us get a step closer to figuring out what dad's "Normal Life" is hiding, or how to save Matpat if he can be saved...  Edit: Another glitche at 22:52 please comment if you find anything
In australia we call it fizzy drink 👀
BROOO I had no idea they lived in north carolina! I cant believe one of my favorite content creators lives in my home state.
Rootbeer
No this cant can't happen
I’m on team steph! I say coke for any soda :0c
I used to live in NY when I was younger, so I’ve always been a “soda” guy myself. “Pop” isn’t bad, either...but “coke” is just weird. There’s literally some drinks _named_ coke, so that’s just really bizarre XD
has anyone else noticed the random glitchy green frames in videos all across youtube today
Mat probably won’t see this but the reason he probably didn’t like the Coke Zero as much is because the flavor was too close to Diet Coke, so your taste buds probably sensed it as a imitation while tho other was just a different drink. Just like Coke Zero lovers dislike Diet Coke, Diet Coke lovers dislike Coke Zero.
But hear me out, the real winner is just water

Late breaking news: The body of disappeared youtuber Matpat, was found scattered throughout 4 Midwest states. The only suspect Coca Cola was said to have been out of town during the incident 😆
Wait what? Dr. Pepper isn't considered a cola?? What is my life???
Fountain comparison is a bad one to use as a source it taste better because the syrup ratio is more in favor of syrup.
the seed numbers are scuffed, just sayin
Food lion is in Virginia(the state) as well. Probably because the states are directly next to each other.
So are we gonna just pretend that RC cola just doesn't exist?
Diet Dr Pepper rocks.
No

harris teeter is in VA too
This is a weirdly interesting pop episode
Pop
just drink tea instead. better caffeine, more hydrating and not bad for you
What! He doesn't want diet coke!?
I always call it soda, though I don't really do diet, as I don't like the aftertaste. If I'm going to drink soda, I'll just drink a normal soda.
Soda
We call it soft drink here in oz
Soda is what it's called here but pop and coke just sound weird to me😶
But hay thats just a theory a food theory
Food lion makes a soda called “mountain lion”. Legit tastes like Mtn Dew
Tfw you live in the state below MatPat and there's not a Kroger near you
I'm 4 minutes in and thought twice already a commercial break for the sponsor would come through the transitions. Maybe ptsd?
I was rooting for Harris Teeter like crazy from the start.
Try an soda from Jamaica can "ting"
I'm literally obsessed with diet coke. Matpat and I are the same
Up here in the northwest (specifically washington) I've only ever heard soda
I had Diet Coke once ONCE now I am addicted

Soooo did I really just spend half an hour watching a grown man and his wife play fantasy football to decide what soft drink they like? Answer: yes. Yes I did. And I'm not sure how to feel about the fact that I, as someone who also drinks a lot of DC, want to try the same thing now.
Those 15 calories in Coke Life are worth it.
Was that the blue devils
G fuellllllll
As someone who switches between Harris Teeter Zero cola and Coke Zero depending on sales, I approve of this finale lol
Steph at 20:43 "Wait, he's actually serious"
someone else catched all the glitchy colors? steganography?
. . . Why limited to diet colas?
Diet  fanta
Matt hate this Coke also Matt keeps on drinking it
OH NO, anyways.
Imposible!!!!!!
Pepsi max cherry is the way to go, peeps.
Title- I QUIT Diet Coke       Sub count-   -1 (not me)
Ironically I am drinking Diet Coke
Matpat bread gloves: I sleep  Matpat QUITS diet coke:  *R E A L   S H T ? ? ?*
Coke zero is good tho
Matpat we support you on your journey to recovery, we love you
Over here in the UK I'm with the simple "Soft drink"
MatPat: Grand Zenos Diet Coke: Goku Harris Teether: Jiren Coke Zero: Frieza  Your welcome weebs
Pop and soda
Matt and Steph playing Rock Paper Scissors is couple goals
Matpat: *quits drinking Diet Coke * “That’s another one for apocalypse bingo!”
No one:.. Matpat in thumb nails: I look older than I am irl and i need sleep
Nuka cola
Fanta is underrated change my mind
I mean, to be fair, there's the South and then there's Florida, soooo... yeah.
gotta be honest, the moment pat said fountain diet coke was better than canned or bottled diet coke (even tho there are still glass bottled diet coke) this whole thing felt wrong, fountain soda looses a pile of fizz and the syrup balance is never on point, either too watery or too syrupy.
Boylan gang
Whenever you do tastings, do remember to include a palate cleanser between each flavor!! Results may be biased.
you need to switch to diet pepsi
MatPat is Vitamin C deficient, and that's why Citric Acid has been so important in so many different Food Theory episodes. But that's just a theory, a FOOD THEORY theory.
Soda. Pop is the action of destroying balloons and similar things. Coke is a brand. I dunno what else you'd call soda
Is it Sh(aa)sta or sh(augh)sta
Where I'm from, I grew up calling them "soft drinks." I'm so surprised by the winner and how convenient it will be to purchase them since you guys live nearby to their shops. Always remember to drink diet coke in moderation and stay healthy. :3
Yeah it’s weird, my favorite root beer is meijer brand (local grocery)
In South Africa we would just say "what drink do you want?" which usually is known as which soda you want. But as kids it was referred to as "fizzy drink" and I think when we got older we just dropped "fizzy", there are people in South Africa that do refer to it as soda though, if you say soda people will know what you are talking about, but if you say "pop" people won't know what you're talking about.
Pop
Me beast is from 3:25
c
I'm from the South and yes we are chaotic, is that a problem? Also I call it soda or coke, mostly coke.
Pop
you forgot about coke in a glass bottle and bag
15:28 D, Drink Badam ching XD
I always knew it as soda
Other fizzy drink is what most of us say in Australia
When I stopped drinking Diet Coke, I went to seltzer with a splash of grenadine. No aspartame or caffeine.
Here in my country, neither did we call em "coke" or "pop", we called em "Pepsi" not even joking! Whenever we in store people be like "I want a Pepsi" "Which flavor?" "Mountain dew Pepsi" Or  "Coke Pepsi" Or any carbonated drink but they all Pepsi's!
Blue Sky Soda, Cola flavored
at 13:29 there is a flash of color, i dont know if it has anything written in it but i saw it.
Please try Jones cream soda
am soda no amgy comments
1:06 I'm a bit disappointed. I was sure the start for 3D Space Cadet Pinball was going to play.
Pop
I tried to like Stevia as its supposed to be healthier but it tasted really, really disgusting to me. I couldn't understand why so many people loved it and claimed it had a pleasant, sweet taste. I could even tell when a product uses it as a sweetener without being told as it tasted horrid to me. So I looked it up and interestingly a small number of people can't taste the sweetness in stevia only a chemical acrid taste, it was a relief to learn as everyone I know thought I was weird or lying about how bad it tasted to me.
Shasta isn’t bad
I call it soda and coke
I’m a manager at food lion and it’s always neat to hear you tubers that know the store.
Nice use of turtle food Matpat.....
Me sees title. Also me  Impossible.
Nooooooooooooooooo
YESS!!!
I'm Nashvillian so I say soda, buy I understand when someone wants a coke.  Also isn't citric acid also known as Vitamin C ? Perhaps that could be a reason it works.  Also I can confirm. They way you described HarrisTeitter cola, it reminded me of all Big K products which are suprisingly fruity. Literally, taste Dr Pop. It's stupidly fruity.
Diet soda is the skusta
Can you imagine how much they had to pee afterwards
this is a good way to try get new sponsors
Once again, Michigan just misses out on something good. None—zero—of those Kroger-owned brands you showed at the end are within 300 miles of me.
I work at an ice cream production plant and different grocery stores ice cream have the exact same ingredients as others. I always chuckle when someone says they prefer one brand over the other but they are exactly the same.
Hmm we have some food lions near us but thats in south VA like deep south so i guess there will prolly be more in NC
Harris Teeter after this video: stonks ⬆️
As a guy who lives in the south, I say soda
A
9:13 woohoo Paraguay in the map thanks to stevia :)
Do diet pepsi
i say soda pop
diet pepsi...
Food lion: why do I remember this from the strange case of origami yoda?
Diet Coke  disgusting
8:10 has wierd glitch
ok
Mat: Im gonna quit diet coke Me: *doubt*
I’m from the south and I’ve never heard someone refer to carbonated beverages as “coke”, that must be a small region thing. People call it “soda” or “pop” or even “soda pop” here.
Pop
Hey mat I have also noticed that the size of the bottle also influences the flavor
Parris Peeter
Diet Coke has been replaced by Harris Teeter for MatPat... I am SHOCKED.
Soda on my end here in Texas.
So am I the only one who unironically liked and still likes the Sans is Ness theory?
Here in canada we call it pop
And so Mat and Steph had a swollen and very gassy stomach for like an hour or some
From king soopers me and my friends were bored so we got that same off-brand store soda! Ours was flat but it had that fruity flavor that I personally didn’t like. It’s so weird thinking that it’s all the same like-
I call it fizzy drink, because us British are too simple for ‘soda’ or ‘pop’ (or coke)
COOOOKEE
this channel was made to destroy a company's stocks
next episode will be about a secret organization that secretly controls the food industry manipulating the supply chain and price of citric acid, the holy grail and best kept secret of ingredients
I love Steph's shocked pikachu face near the end xD also I called it "soda-pop" for a while growing up, " pop" sounds more fun
Ha the nearest thing that Kroger owns to me is an hour away
time to go to Kroger
From the Midwest, so I say 'pop' always will. Also lived in Virginia for a while and they had a food lion there as well. My mom and I called it food kitty.
I saw the title and worried that MatPat was going through an existential crisis and it was gonna be a couch talk like he does on Game Theory from time to time.
diet drp..
2.37 million subs let’s go!!!
Coke Zero is vastly superior
when they say kfc and theres a ad about kfc
I thought the Diet Rite cola was diet *rice* cola at first
I'm from north Carolina Asheville what town are you in?
21:06 it was fait
People don’t know about food lion?! It’s not piggly wiggly or IGA, its like a small Kroger. Do you guys know kroger?!
A. Why are there sudden colored glitches in the episode? There's sudden flashes of color for a frame and then it's gone.  B. Maybe the reason you like diet coke so much is because they once added cocaine.
Nobody and I mean nobody was expecting this day to come.
HEB (southern grocery chain) also has great sodas
March Matness is what wrestlers call the NCAA wrestling tournament
OH MY GOD, IT'S HAPPENING! EVERYBODY STAY CALM! STAY CALM! *STAY FUCKING CALM!*
Bro we at Virginia have tons of food lions
Honestly, Kroger Diet Cola isn't bad, but I'd say Coke Zero is definitely better. As far as 0 calorie/No Caffeine pops go tho, I'm on a Fresca kick :)
Next episode: im back on coke :(
Pop from the midwest
I grew up in Alabama but still have a Canadian/British accent          I’ve never been to either
I'm a pop kind of guy and hey mat, Did you ever call the Drinking fountain at school a bubbler?
Softdrink squad, raise your hands!!!
Change it to Snapple
Me: sees title  Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete
Pop. Ontario.
I'm a Texas girl, and I use Soda
And Matpat singlehandedly sent Harris Teeter’s stocks soring
Me looking at the Publix near my house, "You finally got representation, well done buddy."
D: Soft drink here in Aus
Where the RC cola matpat
D: Soft drink
It's so sad to watch these videos while not living in the US
I was a pop kid growing up, but have been recently flip-flopping between soda and pop.
Why did 599 people dislike
Coca life gives you impressive big burps
I prefer coke zero, for me is coke light that taste a little too much sweet.
What if the secret ingredient for the crabby patty secret formula is citric acid
From New Orleans it's cold drink
What! How am I just now finding out Mat Pat is from my home state!?!
As soon as I saw that title.i was like: IMPOSSIBLE
I love coke that is in glass bottle
I have food lion diet cola in the fridge right now.  It's almost as good as their mountain dew knockoff, mountain lion.
Or he could try soda that isn't diet.
Well that was surprising
B
pop and soda
Ah yes I like other, it's very tasty
... oh wow Diet Coke has been dethroned
"Bolth"
I swear if yall are not "Sodey-Pop" then yall trippin
Wait steph leaves gt live and matt quits diet coke? Im SO lost.
Foxon Park Diet Kola its from my home town and by far the best diet soda I have ever tried.
We here in Barbados call them either "sweet drinks" or "Soft drink"
I grew up in the Midwest and I called it sode
NW Ohio, pop.
So many rock/paper/scissors ties they had to give up is relationship goals.
Galadon gaming reference do as i say not as i do
Me and my father not-so-lovingly call Shasta cola by the name "Shat Cola"
Wait didn’t Mat drink Diet Coke in the hot wings episode in 2020
Personal fav: Dr Pepper
What happens if diet coke doesn't quit you?
They share straws.  Eww.   (Doesn’t matter that they have a child.  Straw sharing.  That’s where I draw the line)
Where are my can people at!
A) pop B) soda C) coke D) other  Can other count as "all of the above?" My dad says "pop" My mom says "coke" And my grandmother says "soda" Being in the presence of all three of them equally growing up, its basically interchangeable for me. Lol
B:soda
Sad that you didn't use Sams Choice Zero instead of the Diet.  The Zero Sugar version is way better than the diet version.
I always though Matt was Diet Pepsi. For some weird mandala reason.
I like how i live in VA so i got pretty happy when i found out matpat lived in NC lol
The dad jokes... they’ve begun.
You fool you told me what state you live in. I'm coming at mach speed
Am I the only one seeing little glitches every once in a while in the vid
In Australia in "other". We call them 'soft drink'
Did anyone notice that flash of color at 13:30 ?
Me: see title Also me: Imposible
Soda/pop aside, they have great posture. I be shaped like a C on the daily working from home on my bean bag chair.
In Australia we call it 'soft drink'
We call them cokes. All of them are coke.
Wait what does seeded means??
8:10ish time mark.... anyone else see the green blink?
Two words: orange crush
Plot twist: Diet Coke sponsors your next vid to get you back
Me looking at the title:  Mayday mayday we’re going down
imagine next video he gets diabetes
mat you’re in my state I’ll be there in time for dinner
Mat this better be a click bait thumbnail. I can't imagine a world where you quite the diet Coke.
Pop forever
You didn't like Boylan because you prefer synthetic stuff
After trying and failing for years to get Coca Cola to sponsor him, he finally tries to guilt them into it by threatening to switch.
I call them Sodies
Zevia cola is not that good but I liked there root beer
I hate Food Lion so much, Idek why.
I think that your results are botched. There was no pallet cleanser so the tastes have to be deemed inconclusive because even though you are able to identify the soda within the blind test You never still got 100% of the taste of the sodas individually
Try حمضيات soda
D: I just call it fizzy drink, I’m from the UK
For someone so smart, he doesn't seem to know, that diet soda is less healthy than regular soda
No you didn't
I pick other coke pop I pick nothing I drink water only
Diet Coke just lost half it‘s sales.
Food Lion and Harris Teeter are in VA as well
Well I’d recommend the soda Squirt. Yea I know the name is weird but it’s a a caffeine free grape fruit soda. I know it’s not a cola flavor but I’d still recommend
New title: Matpat goes all-in on trying to get a coca-cola sponsorship by going all-out on diet coke.
You cant do that
It’s fate
Coke
we call it soft drinks
cancel racist coke.... dr pepper
The universe: *I sense a disturbance in the force and I wonder how many others sense it too.*
17:14  OMG!!  An actual human being unironically used the phrase "same difference" correctly!!  This is honestly blowing my mind...
Coke not pop not soda
I wish I could send some mets cola from Japan. It's really enjoyable and still has its caffeine. It's carbonation is really good also. If you come to Japan try to find it.
Pick pepsi
wonder what answer the soda-pop ppl choose.
I’m from the south and we call it SODA
Splenda is known to cause cancer. So Yeah i'm not drinking that.
Soda gang, raised in Pennsylvania
It's a shame that they couldn't get more brands would had love to see what Mat thinks of Giant food, Aldi, and Lidl.
I call it fizzy or fizzy drink
MatPat: I quit Diet Coke Literally the entire fan base: *wait that’s illegal* Edit: How is this my most liked comment-
I’m soda but literally an hour away from me is pop
Food theory: North Carolina is sending radio waves through the air to make people like their store's brands more. They finally got Matpat, the strongest resistance is gone.
Boyland birch beer is by far the best birch beer though.
Soda. It's soda. I represent Florida
Other We call them soft drinks💁🏾‍♂️
Coke Zero. lol
Note to self: local brands can be better than your regular
Title: I quit Diet Coke Me: pressing x to doubt
Can someone please tell me why everyone hated Sans is Ness? I don’t see the problem
C: Everything is coke
This has got to be the click-baitiest title in history of the internet.
Soda
Confirmed, food theory will have a new sponsor, Harris Teeter
i live in nc and lil i though food lion was like a us wide this lol
I call it soft drink, idk that might be an Australian thing
D: Other ( Soft Drink - Australia)
The Bachelor but for Diet Coke
Boylan’s root beer is 🔥 just saying.
Soda or yummy stuff that i like
What did you do to our matpat!
I was and always will be a “soft drink” kinda person.
Battery Acid
Soda
food theory, everything from kroger is better the original dont boo me
I live in Italy, and for the question, I have to go D: other  here we ask for Coca Cola, and if the waiter asks if Pepsi is okay, Italian Coulter is to reply asking back “is Monopoly money okay to pay with?” 😂🇮🇹
Matpat... quits... Diet Coke..? SACRILEGE!!!
Can someone do this test with European coke brands?
I never knew food lion was from North Carolina. I’m not surprised they beat Pepsi they have pretty good sodas.
MATPAT TRY PEPSI IT good soda
15:29 Im Suger drink.
Soda, that's what we call it in the north east USA
Watching this and realizing that due to national food regulation standards I’ll have to travel to the US before I can actually try any of these and taste what they’re tasting 😶
Pop here in iowa
Idk about you guys but here in Maryland we have food lions too🤷‍♂️
I think a lot of Coke employees saw this and downvoted it...
I will have to add this to my next Kroger click list pick up.
In Oregon it’s pop/soda
did anyone notice the glitches in the video? is it just me? also, the description capitalized MA in March, MA in Madness, and WA in watch. Makes me wonder
Pop: Can Soda Pop: bottle Soda: Fountain I'm weird and say all but coke
Coke
Only diet soda I drink is Diet Dr. Enuf. Sodium free too! I'm obsessed with it.
Looks on all the Soda. "Wait that's all?"~First thought. Looks at her Afri diet coke. "WHY ISN'T THIS ON THE LIST?!". A few minutes later: Oh it's a Europe (German) product. Begins cackling and snickering. Poor Matpat. He will never taste the best of the best. xD
in Nigeria all soda is referred to as "Mineral" so you would ask for a bottle of "Mineral" then specify which brand.
Pop
Frys is a tech company
HI Matpat HUGE FAN!!!!!!!
Mat pats real name is Matthew Pattew
Real quick, before I watch this video!  It's not clickbait right!???
Makes me sad that he said you’ve probably never heard of food lion
Video idea : Artificial vs Natural Sugar, Which One Is Healthier?
I'm obsessed with Coke Zero. I drink a lot of it, to the point that if I go a couple days without it, I get withdraws. They are not pleasant
Plot twist: He actually prefers Coke Zero.
Hello
GASP
Sorry but I think it is pop
YOOOO HARRIS TEETER WINS IT OUT!!! MY BOI
Man when he is talking about the criterias I legit slowed down the video to 0.25 percent to see what the yellow flash was if it was a secret. I wasted a whole 10 seconds. Like matpat and fnaf but 10 seconds not practically 10 years😂
Me seeing fake coke : REEEEEE  the staff: mr. Are you okay?  Me: WHY THE FAKE COKE ?!  the staff: cuz we don’t have money  Still me: YOU WORK AT A STORE  the staff: mr. Please go away                                                                     This is for Store owners DON,T PUT FAKE CRAP ON YOUR  SHELVES
Will the 4th theory be Conspiracy Theory?
Whats up with all the green?
Pepsi MAX is the best soft drink for me.
Diet Pepsi
*Top Ten Anime Betrayals*
FOOD THEORY: Mat made this episode to write off his Diet Coke as a business expense.
I still maintain that Nuka Cola is the superior soda.
In Australia they're called soft drinks
Mt. Dew is the drink of tHe memes
Me sees the title: Impossible
Where I live we interchange coke and soda so yeah south texas be strange
In my country, we say soda
Do they have a Diet Coke fountain in their house?
Where I live we call it soft drink, Otherwise we just call it by the actual name of the drink. The reason why its called soft drink for anyone who might not know, it's  a counterpart to hard drinks aka alchohol
by the gods
I love diet Pepsi caffeine free
Believe it or not, but the brand "Food Lion" is equal to the Belgian supermarket "Delhaize". I recognise that lion of them anywhere!
I drink 100plus
I’m in the Midwest but I say soda...
I live in NC
Pop
What was that green thing at 8:11 or 8:12
Hello from the home town of dillons
Fountain drinks have more syrup because they'll be diluted with ice when served, plastic bottles...well...yeah they give a taste... Glass bottles are best, but they're rare so cans is the best common one
Rest In Peace Diet Coke
8:10
Title: I QUIT Diet Coke! Me: Impossible
Soda for me down here in Bakersfield
This feels illegal
What about costco
One word to explain why Aspartame is allowed to exist: Rumsfeld.
I'm possibly taking a risk saying this but I'm a Pepsi person, PRIASE PEPSIMAN
Mat Pat: I just ingested twice my body weight of soda for your entertainment... ???: AMATUERS! Mat Pat: What was that? GMM: AMATUERS!
I call all of it coke, thats southerners for you
Diet soda is the least healthy kind of soda
Cherry cola?😁
I will definitely look into it we shop at Kroger all the time
I'm from the South, so I SHOULD say Coke. I live in the North currently, so I SHOULD say pop. Many people in my immediate family call it soda, so I SHOULD call it soda. ...I have called it soda-pop my entire life. What is wrong with me--
If I refer to carbonated beverages as a whole, the term I use is “fizzy drinks”. I don’t tend to need to but anything else sounds weird
I need a comb, Pronto. Loved the show. You guys rock!
Does Harris Teeter have a stock cause if so 👀
I can't handle it the world is turning upside down mat no longer this diet coke is the best and steph has left gt live.
Why diet? Aspartame can be as bad as sugar.
Since I couldn't taste it, I just judged them all by their cans.
Save Alot stores have and sell a cola named "Bubba Cola" They have a 0 calorie Diet option as well.  I honestly prefer it over ANY other brand of soda. Sadly it's not available over here in the northwest. (Edit: Also i grew up in Southern California. We called "Soda" Coke, Pop, soda, Soda pop and on a surprisingly often amount of times, peppered water and bubbly.)
(1) Absolutely a 'soda' drinker, despite the area I transplated to being 'pahp.'  (2) I've heard of Food Lion, but associated them with FL and not NC... the more you know?
In Germany it is Coke as well
I am a I call my soda pop
I like ur cut g
we germans say cola
Matt really has to incorporate the scientific “waft” technique when smelling all of his experiments
I call all soda coke
i always took the diet coke thing as a joke but when i saw u trying to quit i was genuinely surprised and my heart kind of dropped
B. its called soda Matt.
Does Matt like diet more than regular? I’m assuming so since the video is on diet.
Midwest Pop represent!  Also not a fan of diet coke or diet pepsi just don't like their flavors, but do love coke and pepsi zero flavors.  As a diabetic I wanted to get a zero sugar option that I could have some pop on occasion.
Pop all the way
You should have tried cheerwine! It's literally Cherry Tootsie roll Pop soda
Pop I live in the midwest
Fizzy drinks
I just have to say; if this was sponsored by Harris Teeter, this would be the *most* effective ad I have ever seen in my entire life... like- I want it.
See, Matt, your first mistake was calling it diet soda, instead of diet pop. 😝
Pepsi contains citric acid. Most cola and dr pepper drinks also contain phosphoric acid, which is the key ingredient in tile cleaner.
This video has some frame flashes, i'm on mobile so I can't analyse them but you there is one at 4:06
I grew up with soda where I'm from
Tomorrow they’re going to wonder why their sales just went up over night...but we’ll know XD
Clickbait
This episode was cut a second short. "And I'll see you all ne-".
Gooooooood Mythical Theory!
So you're alienating all of the good sodas, nice.
Me: *Sees Title*  “I never thought id see the day....”
As a NC native, the representation in this bracket makes me PROUD!!
Y'all remember when they made Diet Coke Plus? Or was it called vita? Either way it was the diet coke with a small amount of vitamins put in. I don't know officially, but I think they got taken off because of FDA rules. I mean think of it, as if you didn't need more of a reason to drink large amounts of soda, adding vitamins would just make the perfect excuse.   MatPat give me a theory on why it left. I'll buy you a can
So no 1 is going to talk bout the hair in the thumbnail
Dirt sprite cola
For me, number one owuld be ZEVIA COKE!!!
The coke gods would not allow a champion to be shafted in this tournament. It assured that harris teeter diet coke was in this tournament. Twas fate and destiny orchestrated by the soda gods.
4:05. .25 speed. What is that
Hmmm diet sprite
Boyland root beer/cream soda slaps
NOOO YOU NEED DIET COKE
Gotta love the Underdog
Canada is pop
I guess I have to go to Fred Meyer now
Coke
He came looking for copper, and found gold
14:40 Food Lion is the big grocery store on the Delmarva Peninsula (ie. Delaware, eastern Maryland, and the 2 poorest counties of Virginia) where I live, so I've been there all my life. My Virginia Beach classmate in undergrad, though, referred to it as "Ghetto Kitty"
WHAT
Is he starting another ARG with the weird flashes?
Coke Zero is where it's at tho
Should have did this blindfolded   Missed opportunity
I have a question so the whole seeded system what does it all mean? Is that like Scovilles to hot sauce and what exactly is it's significance? That like the generation or something?
WATER
Harris Teeter after inventing matpat: money money
i'm a pepsi guy
Its pop. I will fight you on this. The 11th commandment is thou shalt not say soda
3:46 let’s get what now
The truth within the truth
I didn't know foodlion was that rare lol
B
Me with my 2 liter of Pepsi Max: "Yes, good. Come to the dark side."
What
Wait so are you saying there are people who prefer Diet Coke over normal Coke?
Some sort of ARG or something is being made with all of these screen flashes
In Australia, kids usually call it fizzy drink. Adults call it fizzy too but more likely call it soft drink
Why did you have to do Duke that dirty?!?
Wait is food lion a north Carolina thing? I have a food lion and I don't live in North Carolina (pretty close tho)
So, is the weird screen thing at 13:31 just a glitch or should I send this to a GameTheory ARG reddit somewhere?
B-Missouri
d
Food lion matpat is called Hannafords in new york. And yes the soda is actually quite good. Im a fan of their root beer.
Way up in the northeast where I’m at it’s B. Soda
It’s soda. I live in Wisconsin—the fricken heart of the Midwest and only crazies call it “pop”
Glitch
AAAAAAAAAAAH
Boylan's Birch beer is pretty good imo
GREAT! Now you can move on to pepsi
Caffeine*
In NYC we have a ¢50 Colca and it called a nutty "don't ask why"
Coke Zero is the best
This is not a drill. I repeat. *this is not a drill*
steph picked coke zero over diet coke... we can't be friends anymore :'(
NYC here calls it soda. "Yo grab me a soda when you go out... get me a sprite. Thanks"
As someone in the south, i have never heard sodas referred to as coke. As seen earlier, ive always gone with soda
The reminiscent kite outstandingly muddle because europe fourthly belong lest a receptive heart. likeable, lying justice
How does MatPat ever expect to get a Diet Coke sponsorship when he already advertises them everyday?
atleast try to drink 2-3 glasses of each to see through a long timeline (pfff, i mean a line of time, like from 9:00 to 11:00) tiny edit: or just 1 glass.
yo, citric acid be changing worlds bro
I used to work at Harris Teeter and their brand cheese puffs taste just as good as Cheetos. A lot of their other generic stuff is just as good.
SODA
2:27 ...nightmares
13:29
We in utah actually say "beverage" not soda or pop. So...dont hate me
B: soda
Limsa is what I call soda but soda is the English word I use for it
No
I am a lover of diet isded
Boylan's Cream Soda is absolute GOD TIER!!!!
haha to bad for you losers the closest grocer to me is harris teeter
Congrats Harris Teeter.
This would have been better with less voiceover
Us Iowans say pop but I was always a soda man
I am other. Pop comes in a can or bottle, soda comes from a fountain.
See, I'm hooked on Dr. Pepper...but I'm not tied to the brand.  Dr. Thunder, Mr. Pibb, as long as it's Dr. Pepper-like, I'll drink it.
You know, this explains why I've always liked the Fred Meyer "Kroger" brand sodas over name brand stuff.
Coke should’ve given him a sponsorship now it’s too late
How did fountain Diet Coke beat can and bottle? The fountain stuff near where I live is always flat and watered down
anybody notice the green something around the 8:09 mark? and a different one at 13:30
HAH i have heard of food lion :D ocean city maryland appears to love the NC based grocery story pfft
Pop
Coke life is still a thing in America? It died off almost immediately in Australia.
here pop is anything heavier, like coke or pepsi, while rootbeer is just rootbeer and anything light such as sprite or 7up would be called soda.  so its kind of a mixed bag.
Why does he drink Diet Coke instead of regular Coke
You should do battle of fruit punch brands
Plot twist: this was really just a big advertisement
Pop
First time i noticed the intro says MatDonald not MacDonald
Pop
Kroger makes some really good generic food. I never found their sodas anything special, but I don't drink diet soda, so who knows.
My great uncle described moxie (my fav soda ever) as carbonated coughsyrup with insecticide flavoringXD its not wrong but its sooooo good >.<
CITRUS IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD
diet soda is literally the worst thing to be made ever 🤮🤮🤮
Wait... you live in NC?
Drinking diet soda is fucking disgusting. Soda is poison.
Did yall saw that glitch???
in my family, we didn't refer to it is Coke, Pop OR soda. We referred to it as "The thing" repeatedly until someone understood what "the thing" was.
we call any carbonated drink coke so C for the dub
God: Wait what
Option D: I come from Australia and it's called softdrink
ClickBate dislike this video
South Carolina for the win
Cool
no way. matpat, a man who constantly begs for a diet coke sponsership in his past videos, QUITS DIET COKE
Pepsi, is easily the best cola.
Mattpatt: *this video* Therapist: "this is not what I meant..."
:/ realy
They are tasting these coke’s like wine
Mat: I quit Diet Coke!  Me: *Impossible*
Pepsi Zero? isn't it called Pepsi Max?
I need to know if Mat has ever went anywhere near the Pepsi Co in New Bern, or is like a vampire over there.
more like vlog theory
Maybe try different sodas  (Sorry if you only like coke)
Is it sad that I just realized for the first time that the pizza planet truck is in the intro
People don't know of Food Lion? Do you all know of Food Lion?
rc cola supremacy
Harris Teeter gang rise up
yay!!, stop drinking aspartame.
That moment when you use pop and soda interchangeably
I still prefer coke zero
I like vanilla coke
Matpat before buying harris teeter cola: man they don’t have coke Splenda well I guess I’ll settle for this store brand then  Matpat after trying Harris teeter cola: WOW THIS IS AMAZING
I may go to Harris Teeter and get that to taste it
As a diabetic and diet pop afficinato,  I'm not surprised that Zevia cola bombed. I use Stevia as my choice sweetener for tea and hate that cola.  If MatPat does see this, I would encourage you to try some other Zevia flavours as they're much better. Their root beer and cream soda are my top picks.
We have a few Food Lions down here in Florida, and I can't believe you have them in North Carolina! I hope all of you are doing well, good vibes for all 💓
D and B! I just name whatever soda I want at the moment, it’s rare I say “I want soda”, I more often just say “I want *insert Dr. Pepper, Coke, etc here*”.  I will say I have never had someone ask me “what kind” after saying I want coke before though... using coke as a blanket term for soda isn’t a thing around here I guess.  I never ever call it pop though.
Haven't even watched it yet but the first thing I though was " you ok pat"    Is he ok?
Soda boy
This episode is just several moments of serendipity in a row
MattPatt’s laugh kills me and I’m grateful for it 😂
Alternate title: Soda's got Talent
Don’t you worry about the sans is ness theory, they haven’t disproved it p, and as far as I’m concerned, it is a valid (adorable and happy) theory
Diet soda sucks. Period.
Its pop 100%
2:18 well duke won’t duke it out this year but good pun regardless
I grew up in Wisconsin. I still say soda.
A: POP Michigan, born and raised.
Soda for sure
C
Soda
At 13:30 I see a glitch thing
Fountain coke, is I think what I know as postmix. It's varies wildly place to place and even day to day because it's basically Sodastream and they have to calibrate it.  I don't even count it as proper "soft drink" (Australia)
In the end, the best coca cola ended up being fresher than fresh, with a price that's lower than low.
South Central PA calls is soda! But uh...I moved to the UK so I’ve had to get used to fizzy drink XD
Definitely other i was brought up calling it whatever the product was called ,coke ,sprite whatever never called it soda or pop not much of a word in Scotland
I will NOT be clickbait "he says as he click on the thumbnail that can't possibly be true"
Pepsi Max is the king of soda!!!
and here I was thinking that this was fake
I hate all diet soda cause they all have aspartame in it and it's a nero toxin and can tigger people that have sezures or family history of it
Finally... a win for NC
how is I quit diet coke a theory its a statement
Hey matpat. Long time watcher, doubt you'll see this but I lived up north in new hampshire and now down in virginia, and if I'm remembering right theres a new hampshire store brand that has that fruity taste as well at Shaw's. I work right behind a harris teeter so its great to know I'm so close to the perfect diet cola.
C here.
You should have done a palate cleanser after every taste to make sure your palates were truly unaffected. Also, was your pee carbonated after all the soda you had? LOL.
Had no clue that y’all were in NC. Now I’m worried that my wife and I will run into you because she thinks you’re cute.
I am all of the above for the what we call soda.
Soda, 100% of the time.
Who are you!?! Where is Matpat!!!?!
What a great episode! I forget which store brand I had, but I was shocked at how good their soda was. I also agree that whole foods soda has a weird taste.
I call coke devil's juice!!! Muahahaha 😈
Click bait AF but boy I will watch this!
the onmy reason why i drink pepsi zero sugar is for the caffiene, it has double the caffiene of other sodas
We have faygo but the cola flavor is pretty meh also man i just can't with the diet cola yuck
B
Crabby patty secret recipe made out of citric acid comfirmed
Support the little guy!!! Go for Harris Teeter this year MatPat. Besides, are fountain versions of diet coke available in retail? Aren't they only in fast food chains?
All this citric acid talk. I actually invented a technique using citric acid, called oleo citrate, that extracts more flavor from your everyday citrus. Have me on the show, and we can show people how they have actually been juicing lemons wrong their entire life.
15:32 I'm more of a "Softdrink" kind of person since i don't have a specific soda of choice, we say softdrink since it's more universal and covers more of it
Where's the theory?
I have to try Harris Teeter Diet Cola now
I am so glad that Diet Pepsi landed where it did
I love Diet Coke and Dr Pepper. I guess I need to try this!!!
I think that I know what the 4th theory should be it should be book theory and if you actually make book theory the first book you should make a theory on is rayn's journal its a really good book and there's a series.
I call all soda coke.
I thought Mat lived in California.
Diet Coke is not much different than regular coke but I wouldn’t know since I don’t drink soda.
I'm from Michigan so I call it pop
Its fun how sometimes the cheap options can be wayy better then you would assume. Just wondering though do they not sell Pepsi Max in the us/that area? Because in Norway Pepsi Max is much more popular then regular Pepsi and is the diet soda i have seen been most frequently marketed on tv and at the movies. Just curious.
C. Coke  Nothing else comes close.
Personally I mix between pop and soda. Whichever fits my on-the-spot decision-making persona
Food4Less is my favorite grocery store. They always put sales on family sized Hot Cheetos and last week I was able to get 6 bags for $11 when normally its 3.49 each
I would go with the company that doesn't support voter suppression
Bro every drink is called coke
impossible,,,
We used to have Food Lion down here in Texas, but they left after a huge controversy about putting multiple new expiration labels on expired meat. Surprised to hear there are still stores out there somewhere.
Thats it. I can never watch matpat again.
What's this? a non-theory video? How Interesting...
in texas (or at least my part of texas) we say soda
How is Pepsi considered cola flavored, while Dr Pepper isn't? Like, Pepsi also doesn't taste anything like traditional cola, either...
Ayo thoughts on Cheerwine?
15:30 2
me reading the title: Oh is matpat finally gonna stop drinking that horribly unhealthy (and imo rly gross) diet coke???? actually watching the video: :] oh well I'm still having fun
Kent Island Maryland knows food lion. I used to live there.
Fountain drinks are always better
I live in Evergreen Colorado, a few minuets out of Denver, and I can confirm, my local King Soupers diet soda matches your description Mat!
play in should have been bottle vs can then after the final compare to fountain
I started drinking Bubly and La Croix to get off the cola. Haven't looked back.
As someone who lives in North Carolina, when matpat is mentioning all these stores that most people wouldn't know is kind of cool to me and I don't know why.  edit: idk why this has so many likes but thank you!
Plot twist: this episode was sponsored by Kroger and/or Harris Teeter.
Haven’t finished the video yet, but I feel like Diet Coke is getting an unfair advantage... getting to come from a fountain. Why not all bottled or all from cans? Is it rigged just like sports?
For those that don't know, artificial sweeteners give you brain cancer. Look it up.
Hate the taste of stevia
Dude, just replace it with water. If you need sweet, do juice. Get a juicer. and seriously good thing you're quitting diet Coke because you're going to get brain cancer if you don't.
I just wanna see matpat's grocerie list
A. Clearly. Pop!
D: Us Aussies just call them soft drinks or fizzy drinks
In Iraq we call all sodas Pepsi but we say bebse
14:36 It never occurred to me that people don't know about food lion
Matpat IS lucky he's not a Dr. pepper fan, he'd have to do a whole series for all the versions of that.
B
cocaine zero
Coca-Cola Zero.  It's actually what Diet Coke SHOULD be instead of the nasty "New Coke" that it actually is.  Yass, Steph! <3   Also, I can speak for Kroger's "Big K" Cola is definitely good, but their Dr. Pepper knock off, Dr. K is the nastiest pop I've ever tasted.
Dark Horse for the Ages!
oh, of COURSE it's the stores I refuse to shop at that sell this supposed holy grail soda
I don't even drink soda and I'm invested in this
we in australia its softdrink idk why we call it that here?
I'm gonna give my opinion, so ill probably be argued with, but I absolutely prefer Pepsi over Coke.  I personally feel like Pepsi has a sweeter tasted while Coke has more of a strong taste with some bitterness, but the strength is probably why over half of the people prefer Coke over Pepsi. But I am personally very picky and I hate anything bitter, so the slight bitterness of Coke doesn't do it for me, so Pepsi all the way m8.
I will miss the diet coke jokes
Why do I feel like this channel was made just to get a Coke sponsorship 😂
Have u ever considered.... idk .... WATER
Remember guys, this video was not sponserd.
B
coke
Matt probably only made this vid he could drink diet soda
Off topic,but we actually have Food Lion in Tennessee too!  I might have to try this soda next time I visit friends in NC ☺️
What are you quitting next soy boy. Let me guess ur switching from soy milk to soylent

Me who was born in North Carolina: FOOD LION?
Its more than a little unhealthy to drink a lot of diet coke.
Oh and they've done it Pisswittle has beaten Germany and taken the Ashes, that's right ladies and Gentlemen Pisswittle has taken the Ashes.
KING SOOPERS DOSE
How dare you leave out root beer, especially A&W! It is the nectar of the gods, you heathen! Lol
Anyone else pause at 4:06 looking for lore?
Coke
Note: Glitch at 13:30
Me seeing the title: W E H?
You wanna sPrItE cRaNbErRy
We got o food lion all the time! Go Heels! Also I call it soda
Mat pat: you’ve probably never heard of these local NC stores before  Me who is has lived in NC ever since I was born: I took that personally
You know. In most of my relationships if I had left in the "Florida is in the southeast clip" in while editing I would have been sleeping on the couch for a few days. Not a full week. Just a few days.
I came in expecting to be baited harder than a deep sea bass, but I experienced fate intervening to grant us a Cinderella story
Imagine drinking diet soda
Soda companies after watching this video:  It's free real estate
Speaking of store brands, Food Lion had some of their snack foods on an endcap for sale and I grabbed a few because snacks while working, and my god they are better than the Little Debbie name brand.  The only thing the Little Debbie does better is the consistency of the product. The Food Lion oatmeal cookie creme sandwiches almost always have cream on the inside of the wrapper, the chocolate covered peanut butter wafer bars the chocolate will sometimes pop off a square or two of the top wafer or it'll be super coated.  But they are just as if not more delicious than the name brand while being cheaper. Like the oatmeal sammiches, firmer oatmeal cookies. The nutty buddy bars are more flavorful. The swiss rolls have a better balance of creme and sponge.
yaeee the oggg  diet cokeeee
Early
As a consummate Coca Cola drinking I can literally identify which one is from a bottle(the best btw), from plastic and from a can srsly!
He should stop drinking diet drinks anyway, they have more caffeine than regular sodas
Ok get this the Kraby patty secret ingredient is actually citric acid
Fun fact: Food Lion isn't just in NC. We have quite a few right below you in SC.
We call it coke here in the Philippines
In England it’s fizzy not pop
Steph looks different, is it just me?
b
Yeah, zevia is seriously an acquired taste
In the west we call coca cola. In the west we call it soft drink or soda.
I’m from Texas so it’s a mix between pop and soda but most of the time it’s soda
Bro this was amazing
i saw the title, and i knew was gunna be a lie
13:30
Wait that’s illegal
What why
#northcarolina
I’ve always called it soda
Diet Coke was his life So very surprising Is this even a Theory?
I’m born and raised in Georgia and we have Food Lion as well lol  Also, C: Coke
yo diet coke gave my mom a 14 pound tumor........... thats it
I’m Midwest as well so I call it pop most of the time. But I also call it soda when it’s from a fountain
😱😱 No way you couldn't possibly have given up diet coke! That's your signature drink. That's gotta be apart of some crazy diet right? Diet from diet coke....sounds hilarious when I say it 🤣🤣🤣
I like Zevia
8:09 ??
bottles are retro yet overated
Coke always coke.
splenda has several serious health indications - MatPat: supposedly a healthier alternative  stevia is naturally derived with no health indications - MatPat: supposedly a healthier alternative
noooooooooo
Can someone pleaseeee make a Matpat meme of the Teeters Cola saying "Watch ur man" and then thw diet cola sayin "You shouod watch ur mouth" ?!? plzzz or at least the guy looking back at other girl meme👀👀👀👀
Food lion is in South Carolina as well.
D
Winn Dixie's Chek soda is a fan favorite in my entire household. Pretty much all of the flavors are really sweet and everybody loves 'em, but there's also an absolutely huge library of flavors, with some off the ball stuff you'd never expect to see from any name brands, and they're all super cheap.
caffeine free zevia is much better than the regular cola zevia, should've gone with that
I was scared for a second
Matpat: *stops drinking deit coke* Everyone: Were all gonna die
Matpat is Red Jacket lupin but without anything that makes him cool
Forget soda get ultra pink monster
Diet Dr Pepper is here for the crown.
Virgil's Zero Sugar Cola. I'm diabetic, and this is great. No artificial sugars. it's sweetened with stevia and mung fruit. It's good. I think the mung fruit helps smooth over the stevia. I will say their root beer definitely has that over sweet aftertaste.
Their perfect ik
MatPat quitting Diet Coke is like NASA quitting space exploration
I keep on seeing Borderlands easter eggs in different theory videos and I wish he could find a reason to make another Borderlands theory because it it my favorite game( I just realized this is food theory but if you look carefully at the 3 minute mark though, you can find zero)
While I'm disappointed I understand why Diet Dr. Pepper was not chosen. It would be unfair to the to all the diet drinks you tried to attempt to compete against something so perfect. It would be like the winner of March Madness playing the winner of the NBA Playoffs. Just no contest. Also it's odd that here in Texas we mostly say coke, when Dr. Pepper is usually the favorite.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
For me the winner(s) are whatever soda doesn't have aspartame.
Post the ingredient/nutrition label because they should be identical across labels if they're the same manufacturer
POV: when diet coke won't sponsor you
If he does find something better he’s just gonna get addicted to that soda change my mind
Harris Teeter has the most interesting backstory, no wonder it won.
Fun Fact: Citric acid is often harvested from fungi
I am a pop guy ALL THE WAY
Tommorows news: the famous YouTuber “MatPat” overdosed on coke
I don't know about the US, but here in Germany our store brand colas are usually just coke or pepsi in a less fancy bottle that the grocery store chain buys in bulk an just slaps their label of choice onto. Also we refer to soda as lemonade.
I get so excited when I see a new theorist upload. It’s always a nice break.
Never knew y’all were from NC, been here my whole life. Definitely “coke” when askin for a drink.
Cherry Pepsi is the best. No contest
Pepsi zero... I tried it... and I hated it.
I worked at Kroger before they left North Carolina, and that is how the Colas tasted, a sweet aftertaste of something different. But that could be our regional production plant, so YMMY.
Try mountain dew game fuel
9:37 someone please make a meme of this
This is the locals tournament of Diet Coke. Stay tuned for the Nationals.
Steavia sucks
How is his skin so clear with all the soda he drinks and junk he eats? Is it just because he isn’t getting Adolescent hormones anymore??
As a North Carolinian who has a Food Lion eyeshot from my house and a HT less then 10 minutes away, I can say they can have good sodas. Though I prefer Walmarts Mountain Dew version Mountain Lightning over Mtn Dew and Food Lions Mountain Lion.
New year new diet coke
when i started this vid i was saying my fav is big k but it is not there... then the end hit us with the harris teeter is big k and many others as well...
Harris Teeter wins by default anyways because they give you sugar cookies at the entrance
I absolutely loved Coca Cola life.
Lucky you spend the day drinking soda
No wait pop
I'm just here contemplating how he says "welcome to food theory" from his mouth live. All these years just hearing it 🤣🤷‍♂️
If mat isn’t careful he’s gonna become Linus with those faces of disgust XD
Based on the two grocery stores I think they live in burlington... I could be very wrong but that's the middle of the two closest grocery store locations of the two brands shown in the video

shasta cola from save a lot is cheeper and better
Did something happen to the original audio for this video?  Lol, it seems like half the scenes are being explained to us instead of us just watching em.
Started drinking Sam's Cola a few months back since Coke is so pricey these days. Glad I switched. It tastes almost the same but I save money and it isn't as "addictive" in my experience.
soda
palate cleanse
Im A and B
Out of season april fools joke?
Me sees title also me “no no impossible IMPOSSIBLE”
Not me planning a road trip to North Caroline just to try the fabled “Cola”
As a Korean guy, I call "soda" cider.
Mostly pop but sometimes soda
In the end steph be like “what the what is happening”
always called it soda
Coke zero is actually the closest to regular coke diet drink I've ever had no joke
I can guarantee you, stevia is one most healthy sugars
I mean Aand B
Now's my chance... I can give mat a crippling addiction to Irn Bru, Internet aid me in my quest!
After watching this I decided to take a look at cane sugar prices. And my god it’s less than $50 for 50 pound barrels. If you buy 10 it’s $43 instead of $49. I know I would’ve impulse bought myself 100 pounds of sugar if I didn’t leave the site
I'm a Soda and Other (Will to Live) person
A and c
As a Virginian I resent being told I'd never heard of Food Lion, plus I work there
Ima soft drink/softie
In Britain cough medicine actually tastes good... so when they said one of the diet drinks tasted like cough medicine I didn’t get at first why the horrified reactions.
So harris teeter is big k that's makes sense big k sodas are actually decent.
My coke
*has*
Im doing a challenge to give up soda for a year and lemonade is my savior
All sodas are bad for you, but the worst is diet, the safest of the diets is stevia based ones, each year more and more proof comes out that diet sodas with  aspartame, cyclamates, saccharin, acesulfame-k, or sucralose are all detrimental to your health to the point of kidney failure to death, no joke, switch to stevia if you insist on diet or just drink regular soda, better yet dump the sodas totally and get yourself a bottle of water
I thought he was in California. I remember the fires got really close to his front door.
id like to see a theory of which is the best overall soda world wide
I want to believe that the screen distortion at 13:31 is some kind of technical error, but the amount of ARG's I've seen here on Youtube have made me paranoid.
:0
That's all nice and dandy but all diet soda tastes like absolute trash so this doesn't change anything.
dude is pepsi counts as cola so does dr pepper cmon now
My friends drink Zevia.
I used to live in North Carolina and I remember food lion.
That was unexpected. I am just as shocked as Stephanie looks.
smh, imagine quitting diet coke. Couldn't  be Mat.                   *Right?*
I always forget y'all are from NC! I wonder what city. Asheville represent!
I've heard of Food Lion only because Ahold Delhaize, the Dutch company that now owns Food Lion, is one of our clients at my job, and we had to put Food Lion branding all over the Ahold instance of our application for them 😂  As for your poll, as a Florida boy, I'm firmly a "soda" man and always have been. None of this "Pepsi is Coke" or "pop" business near me, please 😁
D Soft drink
I’m not really surprised by the Boylan soda smelling/tasting like cough syrup, some of the older soda pops/flavors got their start as medicinal drinks.
RC COLA BABY
SODA 100%
my first thought on seeing the title: is it April 1 already?
Wait, it's all citric acid?  Always has been.
Didn't realise you didn't talk about diet coke in 2020 at all till now
15:28 I'm arab, so, I have to say this, D. For "Bebsi." Hahaha. I swear, most of my family can barely pronounce English. I'm only the daughter of an immigrant and the son of the son of an immigrant, so, like, I've been in America since I was born, and that would be 14 years ago next week, and my mom still can't pronounce Pepsi. Hahaha.
Diet Coke: mwahahahaha why would we sponsor Matpat if we can just get free promotion from him.  Matpat: makes this video  Diet Coke:   👁 👄 👁
Try japanese kitkat flavors plzzzz
Ouh so.... Just replace then
*Matpat explaining how he actually likes HarrisTeeter* Stephanie: “I don’t even know you anymore”
WHAT IS THIS? YOU'RE NEVER ALLOWED TO REFERENCE DIET COKE EVER AGAIN.
Can you really call this a theory?
I'm a soda man
After what mat pat made his choice did anyone see a hole get ripped into space-time Continuum right in front of them
soda
First Steph leaves gt live and now matpat leaves diet coke 😭
POP! sometimes soda. I'm in the midwest
I saw the title and was like "Impossible"
SODA most of the world sais soda
I’m from Texas. I say “soda” because I grew up in the city but my extended family in rural Texas says “coke”
Lol
why do all those grocery stores hate having a location in florida xD
My husband and I used to work for Pick N Save (Kroger store). We love many of their “brand name” items and save so much money. We’ve been theorists from the beginning, so we felt like we were just featured in an episode 😂
Yo I don't drink that much soda so every brand of soda tastes the same to me 😂, would have never been able to tell the difference
Team sode for me
No Foxon Park kola ;(
#Pop

Soda Pop Curtis
C. coke 100%
D In my region of canada it's a Fizzy/Spakle drink (soft drinks like cola are fizzy, carbonated fruit juices like S. Pellegrino (the do more than Soda water) are sparkle) but if you ask for a soda you get the list of Carbonated drink from water to malt cocktail (those are alcoolic carbonated drinks)
Me realizing none of those stores are near me
“And this video was sponsored by Harris Teeter” lol, I wish that happened
NOOOOOOOOO
(19:00) THERE TOO SIMILAR
I go by pop 15:27
I’m a ‘fizzy drink’ person
13:30 anyone see that?? 👀
I am other I love iced tea
food “theory”
Big K (Kroger's Soda Brand) has always had extremely PERFECT soda flavors. Yeah, if I had to go to generic for any reason, Big K is where I'm headed.
I'm the only sane person here and calls it softdrinks lol
i have a mini theory about why matt pat really likes the harris teeter brand. the reason being its different. he's been drinking diet coke for a LOOOOONNNGGG time, and eventually people will get bored of repetetive foods and drinks, just ask my dad who ate nothing but pasta, ground beef, and tomatoes with no seasoning everyday for three years. sure, that combination is the most unoffensive thing in the entire world, but it got old really quick, and more related to the video, its why eating too much candy can make you not want to eat any because it gets boring. So something that reminds matt pat of his favorite drink, yet changes it up a bit to add interest, would be more appealing. Us humans like diversity and new things, so it makes sense why Harris Teeter would be Matt pats new favorite
My aunt works at Kroger and is a manager their so imma hit her up and let u know what I find out
While I'm not a fan of coke diet or otherwise, I'd recommend dr.pepper

You should have taken a break between the rounds so you are less likely to instantly identify the drinks.
Diet soda is terrible for your health.  I dont know how true it is but supposedly aspartame, the artificial sugar substitute used in diet sodas, contains carcinogens.
0:00 Well let me introduce you to Coca cola Original! real sugar real taste. zero and diet versions are for pussies, (excluding diabetics)
Ik same brand might have different taste in different places, but im team Coca-Cola Zero for 5 years +-. There is no Kroger or similar drink in my country.
I'm from the south and say soda. I hate coke so much I never want people to be confused and give me actual coke. Dr. Pepper all the way:)
I’m a pop person
I typically hear "coke" or "soda," but I prefer to say "soda," because it doesn't show brand loyalty. I love Coca-Cola, but I also love Pepsi, so I really don't care which any given restaurant has, so I choose to say the neutral term when asking for soda.
Matpat noo you need to stay on brand ahahaha
its the gayness, thats why he likes it
A and B.
Hey, Food Lion was a pretty short walk away from my house when I lived in South Carolina
Soda and pop are both correct but if you call anything other than coca cola a coke you better be ready to lose your kneecaps

oh, i just look it up and diet coke ha no high fructose corn syrup in it.
TIL Food Lion is not a country wide grocery store
After living in North Carolina for almost 5 years, you can't go anywhere without hearing/ seeing a harris teeter, food lion, or publix. We love our local stores.

Sticking to cola flavoured things means your missing out on irn bru
I'm currently going through the processes of switching from real soda to diet and I chose Coke Zero as my soda. Side note I call it soda.
I thought they were quitting on food theory but it was actually just diet coke
Diet Faygo Cola.... Pretty good diet cola What about RC? What about Tab?
You can’t give up Diet Coke after making a big meme over it
When you're a RC Cola boy but no one else is... :(
It's "Soda" here in the South... if I ask for Coke they ask me if Pepsi is okay?... no body I know call all soft drinks "coke" 😝
Big K  cola Oh is BAE
What! glass bottle diet Coke didn't get to compete! That stuff is available everywhere.
I don’t know why but I thought the title said “I quit diet cake” 🤦‍♂️
I'm a fellow Ohioan. So Team Pop for me!
Where I live, we just always say 'cola' regardless of the brand - with the sole exception of Pepsi, which is just called pepsi.
And Film Theory just earned a spot on my list of channels that get watched at 2x speed. This is, no matter how well done it could be, just a *taste test video. You are Game Theory, not Trendy Content Farm.*
Down in Australia we call it soft drink

In Ireland we call it generally a Fizzy Drink but often call it by its name
i grew up in Buffallo Ny, so i grew up calling it Pop. but a stint in the military got me calling it soda now
POP!!
Living in Hungary Spar and CBA will not supply me these 😭
I love TAB... It's sad if you don't have it locally. It's very similar to diet coke but... imo far better :p
4:05 That flickering made me think there is some hidden message in the video, but it was just flickering :/
Drink
Now I am curious I kinda wanna know about all these differing sweeteners and if one is truly healthier than others.
Sprite all the way
i dont care
good matpat, high fructose corn syrup/corn syrup isn't good for you, so good for you.
I too am addicted to Diet Coke. Also crystal pepsi was the 90s but what do I know
I call them soft drinks.
I’m a coke gremlin- I live in Georgia so yanno
I think cola is cola
Dr. Pepper
My brother and dad are literally watching a march madness game right now wtf
The only coke stigma down here is "Can I get a coke?" "Is Pepsi alright?" and either they deviate to an alternate soda or settle. #PopIs4Losers
I love your videos MatPat. You are so funny and seem so cool/odd. But odd in a good way. You and Steph are a perfect couple. Your chemistry together is unmatched. I love you guys
i say coke
Pop is typical here. Soda is fine. Calling anything but coke coke is insane.

A. Pop , I had heard Pop was only a Michigan thing not a general Midwestern term. I've been to Chicago and never heard it called Pop when I was there.
I always love drinking a good ol' can of other.
And here I was thinking that he would stop entirely
Like the little frame changes :)
Soda
20:33 So in conclusion you have been kidnaped in your sleep and are in a simulation
when i work at Kroger and apparently they sell the best Diet Coke... guess i need to try Diet Big K.
diet coke is just gross, plus they lie about "no sugar" when its just caramel syrup
This is so true, though; my grandfather worked for a "private label" factory back in the 70s, so I grew up knowing this story and always go for the generic brands because they're usually the exact same thing as those big name ones on the same shelf. All you're really doing is buying the label and branding. I think the private label he'd worked for was connected to the Ocean Spray juice company back then...
I no joke say soda pop
*Never thought i'l see the day*
Ah. Kroger. A fucking ton of their generic stuff is amazing, often being better than the big name stuff. the best part is that it's for the generic product price. you can't get me on diet sodas though. every diet soda is disgusting. also, i'm surprised you picked the diet coke from a fountain. most of the time fountain drinks are terrible because the mix is always off and inconsistent between locations and even day to day operation of one place. good mythical morning found that canned sodas were almost always the best source and i agree for their reasoning. cans do tend to hold on to that extra fresh bite in the carbonation which really sets it far above other sources where it leaks out like crazy. they also tested glass bottles too so they had 4 sources. they originally thought the glass bottle would be the best, but then the cans rekt that theory. but that's just a theory. a comment theory. thanks for reading.
Grandma cooking dinner: Me:  GRANDMA, CAN I GET A POP!!! Grandma:  go ahead
That mountain of diet soft drink is a certified avengers level threat
For me and all my friends its soda
Our totally scientific testing: *Proceeds to play rock-paper-scissors to decide a winner.*
15:30 Choice A:  I am strongly a "pop" person
I remember that for special occassions at school we would always have Lipton iced-tea because everyone in my grade universally agreed that it was great.
Wheres anime theory
I can't tell if the camera is occasionally glitching, or if it's a sneaky edit because of an ongoing/upcoming ARG MatPat's been working on. 🤔
Loved the episode. But please, stop mansplaining Steph’s lines. She has potential as a co-host!
boylan = pog but there cola sucks
Grape Fanta is superior to all.
I'm from New Jersey. I call it soda.
The cola that I drink is: Coca-Cola Zero sugar same great coac taste now with a hint of added vanilla!
i saw the title and thumbnail and i was like: OMFG IS HE OK!?? WHAT HAPPENED???
Since I’m Aussie, we call it fizzy drink
Me: Going frame by frame at 4:06 to see if the display bug is an easter egg
me when i see the title: spits out diet coke in shock-
13:31   Did anyone else catch that screen glitch?
Something that I've noticed recently, is that if you continue to binge sodas, they loose that signature flavor that brought you to them in the first place, and to get that again, you have to put it down for a week or so, and swap between them to get that joy again (a food theory for the future maybe?). After being addicted to Cherry Coke for years, I completely cut myself off, and have only recently begun drinking again, while bouncing between that, and regular pepsi for my one soda a week.
15:29 ... softdrinks
Here in Tennessee, we call soda cold drinks. Well, anything you would be carbonated (except for seltzer water) is a cold drink.
soda pop
Matpat: Nobody's probably heard of Food Lion Mr. Beast viewers:
Wait doesn't diet coke has sugar
I almost had a heart attack cuz of the title
I can say for sure that i've been to all 3 places that says pop, soda, and coke, but I have to go with soda since i grew up in illinois
Woh
does anyone else absolutely love the way Stephanie calls mat pat "Matthew" like a disappointed mother
It's really impressive seeing that you put the somewhat unrealistic ideal soda fountain diet coke in the running.
The daily italian radiographically welcome because wing systematically count above a few fierce friend. rare, spectacular aluminum
Me who shops at food lion 😂
Leave it to mat pat to make a video about trying Diet Coke
It's an absolute miracle that Matt's skin is as clear as it is with all the soda he drinks.
I remember this one time when he was making a King Kong thing
Its POP not soda!
When long time fans see the thumb nail 🥺🥺🥺
Anyone else see the flash on a screen of blue and yellow at like 13:28 ?
No...
just drink water. healthier and tastes better.
No more fatpat
My Diet of choice is Diet Pepsi then Coke Zero, albeit I haven't had a Diet Cola throw down like you. We don't have a Harris Teeter, but we do have Kroger, I'll have to give it a try.
Whhhaaa
I have had all but the Pepsi
I'm really glad for Food Theory, especially now that Stephanie is taking a backseat from GTLive. We still get to see her a lot here.
(⊙o⊙)
Forget little league games, Shasta is best known to me as target practice
Should've just had a cheerwine! you live in North Carolina for christs sake
KAS limon, the main spanish soda, try it
Boy land is the best  best soda ever
The food lion logo looks like the Delhaise brand in the Benelux, i think it's the same. We also call it proxi
The Coke company is gonna be feeling real dumb when they realize the mistake they made in not sponsoring MatPat and the whole theorist community starts buying off-brand sodas instead of theirs.  Also, I say both soda and pop. Although, the only sodas I drink are Sprite, Fanta, Crush, and the like. I’m more of a lemonade or fruity juice (like Hi-C, Gatorade, or Powerade) lover, myself.
3:46 .... really, captions?
Clickbait usually makes me roll my eyes, but that title, it got my attention and kept it all day till I got home to see it
Don’t get me wrong I love game theory and film theory but I really like how steph seems to be more included in food theory.
A. Pop
MatPat: the North Carolina based store Harris Teeter/Food Lion Me, a South Carolinian: he doesn’t even know
I'm honestly not surprised. Rhett and Link have liked Kroger and Great Value more than name brand a lot. And I can say the the Kroger knock off Oreos are better than name brand in my opinion
I thought Harris teeter was a everywhere thing before this video but I guess I need to get out more, also where my NC girls at!?!? 💖
Pop all day everyday
Anyone else got crazy invested in this competition? No? Just me?
I haven't watched the video yet, only read the title. I don't believe you
There were three 7th seeds.
Just when mat was hoping for a coke cola sponsorship he made this video.
I called it all Coke growing up (very southern middle Tennessee town), then converted to soda once I went to college
:'(
try water, or if you really need the fizz then try carbonated water. Once you go water you never go back
I'm from the midwest so I say "pop", my cousin from the east acted like it was so odd when I called it "pop" instead of "soda"
After watching the full video, I say...  WHAT?!🙂
In Australia it is universally “soft drink”. If someone calls it soda, you’d know what they meant; but it was uncommon. Practically no one calls it pop
COLORADO King Soopers!!!!
Kroger's grocery stores are what the company is most known for. According to the company's website, it owns nearly 2,800 grocery stores in 35 states. These stores comprise more than 24 chains, including Kroger, Ralphs, Dillons, Smith's, King Soopers, City Market, Fry's, QFC, and Harris Teeter.   So if you dont have a Harris Teeter your Kroger Brand might be the same soda.
Now that you've established the importance of citric acid in food production, maybe a future episode should be about what citric acid truly is and how it's manufactured.
Best drink is water.
Soda Pop is what we say here
13:30 See the Glitch no just me ok
Coke Zero!!
14:41 "Food Lion, which you probably never heard of..." Me: worked there for 9 years... 🙁
I think you shouldn't know which one you pick in which round, only at the end. Probably would be better for the process to remain imparcial
15:30 northwest Indiana sorta both but mainly “pop”
You should do a Food Theory episode on aspartame. It's got a bunch of bad, non-scientific horror stories scaring people into avoiding it. Kinda like the covid vaccines.
Normal coke
I grew up in Southern England and we always called them "Fizzy Drinks" (sometimes just "fizz" but that can also mean carbonated wine, specifically) but I went to university in Scotland and there they call them "Juice" which was very confusing for me because I know juice as the word for drinks squeezed from fruit and not carbonated.
B:soda
Here in the Philippines, we call it either softdrinks or coke.
You should make a video about those fake artificial sugars about there affects on the body and whether or not their ok to even have
You two are such an adorable couple!
Did anyone else notice the glitch? After watching the clip 30 times I got a screenshot of it. I wonder why it’s there...
I am scared of food videos because they make me hungry.
The intro of food theory sounds like a future jojo theme song.
Anyone else catch 8:09?
B
Good NIGHT, Diet Coke. You served MatPat well and will be missed, but we have a successor to the Kingdom of Pop.
i don't say pop or soda. i say Läsk
Do you know you can make Mac and cheese without milk
Noooooo mat pat the elixir of the gods
pop
I know what food lion is because a lot of people I know live in NC
Yo! I got a diet coke add! What the heck!?
My life has fallen into shambles lol
Steph is as shocked as I was for MatPat giving up/switching up his diet coke
The rock paper scissors was so cute   *one braincell between married couples*
Ginger beer though; now that's a soda. Barritts, Bundaberg and Stoli, can't go wrong.
Soda
Not even a theory but an absolute fact: KROGER CHOCOLATE MILK IS BETTER THAN ANY, HANDS DOWN
Pop
Coke
here you go with coffee and sode and thing idk
Doesn’t the artificial sweeteners in Diet Coke cause Alzheimer’s?
I have to pee just by looking at it
B.  But I remember dealing with this argument all the time in the Army.  We would give the NYC guy that kept asking for a Coke a Coke-a-cola unless he named the soda even if we knew what one he wanted.
Stevia is not bad because it's too sweet but because of it's weird after taste flavor.
Alternate title: matpat went to rehab
well crap, 2020 and 2021 are very broken
If you make kool-aid add a few drops of lemon juice. Changes the game
This is click bait. I haven't watched the episode but, how could he, right?  BRB
Mat really putting his diet coke skills to the test
I love ztevia
I say pop and soda because I am from North Carolina and I live Wisconsin.
I would have liked to see you try breize cola in there. It's a French cola from Brittany. It wouldn't have won but hey, would have been fun.
Doesn't Harris Teeter eliminate itself as it has a flavor profile to it?
Yes! Kroger (Food 4 Less and Ralphs) has the best diet cola and root beer
Trader Joes Private Label video???
over here in the Pacific Northwest we call it soda,
B
In New Zealand we call it fizzy
Mexican Coke has a better taste and is actually BETTER for you than Diet Coke. Plus, how can you top the ORIGINAL formula of Coke?
15:29  LÄSK
Beating Diet Pepsi's no accomplishment.
MTN dew it was the original gamer drink
Hes beaten his addiction but on the other hand he did replace it
Matt: I quit Diet Coke  Also Matt: Thats just a Theory, A Food Theory
Boylans is pretty bad all around lol as a soda specialist I would recommend red rock premium cola my favorite cola of all time
I actually call it soda pop lol
hey matpat, you good?
I'm a Soda guy
Coke when asking genericly, but I immediately go to what I want when asked what I want to drink.
7:11 - That finger always makes me think of Ronnie Edwards' edits from back in this channel's earlier days. I know it's a small detail, but if that is indeed Ronnie's creation, I think it's really sweet you guys are keeping his memory alive, in some form. 🥰
D: Soda Pop  Because I visited my cousins in a canada a lot and they called it soda pop.
Do this but with water because I don't drink soda
juice ftw
Didn't realize you guys were this close to me, game changing for a few projects coming up
The diet Coke company: not stonks
Soda
I have king soopers in my area like up the road so MAT PATS FAVORITE DIET SODA IS UP THE STREET FROM ME
8:10
This can't possibly be true..........right?
Harris Teeter, Food Lion are both carolina based but you forget to mention that Pepsi was invented in NC as well, man I love our state!
Do drinks taste different from different restaurants
Just like Mark and his Takis, collab episode when??? XD
Soda
I love Pepsi zero like matt likes diet coke ngl   Also mainly coke but it doesn't matter to me lol
Both soda and pop
Im soda not pop
I'm a root beer man myself.
1: definitely called soda 2: Now I want to go to Kroger
I live in Georgia but my parents don’t let me call it anything other than pop or the actual name
Omg guys this is gotta be his most viewed video theorists are tryping as we speak
Soft drink
I feel bad because he thinks that diet soda pop is good. I know that some people can't drink regular soda pop or can't drink diet but he can so.
It’s literally insane because I just started drinking the stevia cola like a week before this instead of Diet Coke. I’m being 100% honest😂
Almost like the Ja Morant story
Soda
Not me Clicking on somewhat clickbait considering that I know that Matpat wouldn’t give up on Diet Coke RIGHT?
U should make ur own soda via water kefir, cause unlike diet soda, it's got a lot more nutrients for your gut bacteria.
Diet Faygo is the best. But you probably can't get it in your neck of the woods.
Grew up in New Mexico, and we call everything coke.
My eyes skipped a beat when i saw this
Pepsi enters the fray
In Louisiana we say cold drink
I am from New  Jersey but I want to your state for my brother's army training I I went in one it was so good better than here
I have been living the past 6 years in a lie-
How did I guess all the winners just by watching?😅
Why Are You Disliking Diet Coke NOW?! Didn't Duet Coke Help Cool Down You're Mouth During The Hot Ones Video?!
i wish he had tried shweps
B: soda
Glass bottles are the superior medium for Diet Coke! Not including it is a travesty!
C....coke all the way
no
Ah yes, an underdog victory. Those are what I live for.
I love that food theory is more live instead of animated like the other two channels, it just fits with the food theme better lol
9:37
i'm a soda person.
Do you guys get irnbrew  pat try it
Long time (and I mean -long- time) subscriber to this channel here. This video was weirdly the most entertaining video in a long while. Love seeing you two together talking about things you love, haha. Cheers!
B
Not gonna lie my favorite drink is still and probably still will stay Kofola (a Czech/Slovak interpretation of Coke that they crated while being apart of the USSR) no matter what happens it’s just good it’s less sweet it has a reaaaaaly recognizable and all and all good taste and it is available at almost any bar/restaurant you go to in Czechia or Slovakia.
I’m A&B
ITS ALL COKE
PEPSI MAAAAAAAN
POP!
here's one instead of soda coke or pop try sodapopcoke
It’s soda. Also Harris Teeter wins out. Buy local I guess.
Me: Sams colaaaaa
I tried Kroger diet coke, it's a meh for my taste buds, coke zero is way cheaper where I lived (which I put it against). Like its must by 5 or more, 1 dollar.
Kroger is the best! I love Kroger! Of course it's Kroger!
Coca Cola heads: Have you sent the offer for sponsoring Food Theory to them already? Rep: shows this video Coca cola: Well that sucks. Cancel the offer and the shipment of Diet Coke.
Food Theory should make an episode about the 99 cheese pizza from the ninja turtles movie
Soda
Johnny Ryan's is the best
Anybody else notice the weird capitalization in the description? MA, MA, and WA
I say soda
*Kroger theme intensifies*
Ontario says "pop"
Wait wait wait wait wait..... I share a state with you guys???? What an HONOR
Wow, hearing that harris teeters soda won and was kroger related does not surprise me at all since it is the one store brand soda i enjoy
the best sweeteners are Allulose monkfruit Stevia and erithrytol because they have legitimate health benefits. However, you need to be adjusted to a sweetener, cane sugar tastes too sweet and disgusting to me now that im on keto, and erithrytol and stevia tastes like the real thing. you gotta adjust to the other sweeteners
Soda
Totally a B kinda gal. :}
A: POP bc im midwestern
Slame a Faygo bro : o )
Noooooo 😭😭😭😭😭
HOW DARE YOU
Pepsi was also created in New Bern North Carolina.
*Sees title, looks at diet coke in my hand* Am I being watched? XD
Even though I was born in the south, I just started actually living here this August, so I say "Soda"
I always thought I was crazy when I liked fountain soda more than can and bottle now I can prove I was right.
new food theory: is citric acid in the crabby patty formula?
Me(Who has Soda Allergy): I don't understand a single word that they're saying.
Me watching the video “in my mind” this so entertaining but I know all the health complications with diet sodas
C
wait for him to find powdered soda lol
MAT PAT you stole im name
Here MatPat. Take dis Bepis.
I feel hurt that diet coke didn't win but I am so proud of Matpat that his choice wasn't biased.
Lets be real this is gonna be a video he is gonna watch it for 100 times again to  see if he missed something ( since this is his time to shine )
14:20 wow
It is soda
Ever tried water?
Is this a click bait????
Coke life is actually really awesome. Im pretty sure diet coke is worse for you than normal coke or coke life.
Diet Pepsi
Hey I live in Tennessee and for the whole beginning portion of my like we shopped at a food lion. It gave me a sweet reminder of the childhood when you mentioned it. Thanks.
No!!!! You shalt not stop drinking the Nectar of the Gods!!
Isn't this vital for your functions? You can't quite something vital for you!
all cokes taste the same ngl
Soda
Glass bottle Diet Coke also tastes different
Not drinking diet coke?! Who are you and what have you done to Matpat?
Publix is the best
4:37 Reminder that This man is a father.
Native Californian = soda  And in terms of generic - anything sugar-based is oftentimes better or equal generic I have found. Definitely always worth trying unless you have some non-taste reason for not drinking generic.
Diet Coke is how he gets his theory powers
R u kidding bro anything but Diet Coke u already gave up ur dignity anything but the Diet Coke.
The rock paper scissors duel was the cutest thing I've ever seen
Soda
Diet Soda...  worse for you than regular soda.   Artificial Sweetener Syndrome (yes it is a real illness that YES the sweetener manufacturers are trying to suppress tomprotect their profits, like the tobacco industry does for nicotine) causes symptoms that replicate various illnesses and sicknesses, including GENETIC DISORDERS.  Symptoms this illness replicates include Cystic Fibrosis, Lymphoma, and Alzheimer's as well as several others.    Artificial Sweetener is an ACTUAL POISON.  It actually INCREASES your chance to become Diabetic, INCREASES weight gain in most humans, INCREASES seretonin overdose causing and WORSENING depression...  as well as a HOST of other problems.    DIET...  SODA...  IS...  DEADLIER... THAN...  REGULAR...  SODA.
Here we say pepsi for all the soda in the world
I quit the milk under the sink
Idk if this comment has shown up yet but kombucha after you get used to the sour taste
Yeah my mom just quit diet coca good that you quit to I heard it’s very bad for you.
Pop is what I call it
whoa, hold up! We are a Stevia family in my house. good grief.
Stubborn agave nectar cream soda and Virlgils rootbeer are good. And yes I know you said cola but those are good, you can get them on amazon
Me reading the title: OH MAY GOSH ITS THE DOOMSDAY SENARIO, TAKE COVER!
This is such a fun idea, and I wish I had the time to put together a taste-test like this, because I think it would be really cool to find out what my favorite soda TRULY is. Currently, it's Wild Cherry Pepsi.
Every time I watch these I am saddened by the lack of counter to confirmation bias (or disco formation bias) so I’m hoping SO MUCH that Matpat DOESNT KNOW WHAT COKES HE’s trying. Commented before watching.
DRINK CHERY COKE
we say pop in michigan
I wish I could get Harris Teeter at my area but I can’t.
B
Can we get a Harris Teeter sponsorship?
diet pepsi
The hugest click bait i've ever seen
YU replacing diet coke?!?
Soda!
Just go to normal coke. Its way better!
D. Cola
That rock-paper-scissors matchup was the best way to show how in tune you two are as a married couple and it brought a smile to my face.
Matpat: Ahh, another video done! Sodas: WE WILL SUE YOU
When referring to drinks that aren't coca cola what do you say:  Coke, soda or pop.  Write your answer bellow!
water is the ultimate drink
Sees title *GASP*!
Can I put a word in for water?
Publix is bae
As someone who lives on NC I'm just happy to get our stores a shout-out
Has anybody else been seeing these green lines in YouTube lately? 4:06
You can order some coke just don't order coke
clearly, the real awnsers is to just put all of them in a large barrel and get very disappointed with the outcome.
I used to live in Virginia before wise took over food lion and I go to the outer banks for Christmas is I definitely know what food lion is
Boyland Birch Beer is the goat. Close tie with Moxie maybe
I'm surprised freeway didnt make it.
Matpat: I'm gonna give up diet coke this year 2020: that's a pretty funny joke
Try mixing the diet coke and the Harris teeter and see how it tastes. Maybe that could be the new winner
I can’t believe that he quit diet coke
i drank 2 entire diet cokes while watching this do i have a problem
Nope the loser of this game is matpats kidneys
guys i think matpat is losing it
Title: I QUIT diet Cook! Me: alright where did you put our mat pat and can you bring him back?
what would other be? i would like some carbonated sugar water with flavor?
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo has he tries the chicken pub sub?
Soda
Do you guys remember that he is that guy from death battle? The power rangers vs voltron episode.
Have you tried something called water
In Texas we call it Coke
Soda
Is Pepsi Zero the same as Pepsi Max in Europe? fun fact in Norway Coca Cola Zero sugar is called Coca-Cola without sugar. But everyone is calling it Zero. Norway is D: Brus or Cola! 😂
it’s a sad day to be canadian :,)
I work for a soda manufacturing company in upstate NY.  We’re not owned by a major supermarket chain but we make product for a number of different companies.  Some use the same formulas, many different.  I was in the quality department and had to taste test items every 20 minutes during a run.  Needless to say soda has more or less been ruined for me and I only really drink seltzer now. You should do a seltzer taste off next!
This is insane. Absolutely mind blowing.
B: no questions asked LOL
Im a soda guy
It surprises me he wants a substitute for diet coke, when he mentions it almost all the time
Pop
It sucks that the older sodas in the glass bottles aren't that great,since there's some sort of novelty with a quality glass bottle.
I'm surprised the fast food restaurant Diet Coke was your favorite. I would've expected it to taste worse than the cans and bottles.
Hey Mat try Cockta if you dont belive  me google it.
So 2020 was the year he gave up Diet Coke and 2020 was the year I tried Diet Vomit for the first time. Interesting year I've gotta say.
By god it must be the end of the world
here in brazil we call soda, refrigerante or refri for short.
This should have been called MatPat takes the Pepsi Challenge, and a majority of Americans may prefer Pepsi in a blind taste test v. Coke (the Pepsi Challenge), but MatPat does not. Although I guess technically this was the Diet Pepsi Challenge.  Personally I think I go with pop, but soda pop, soft drink and soda also work.  My dad was weaning himself off sugar in his tea (like actual hot freshly brewed tea, not iced tea like you insane Americans automatically assume) by actually growing stevia and using it in his tea instead of sugar. I found Stevia nasty (but no nastier than I find all artificial sweeteners). I think my dad did too as soon enough he was just taking his tea with milk and no sugar.   I prefer drinking straight club soda, mineral watered, carbonated water with no flavouring to any diet drink and much of my immediate family likewise dislike the after taste we associate with artificial sweetener, perhaps we have some genetic taste feature that explains this?
I am Southern and I can confirm Coke is a common thing
How much you wanna bet BOTH their teeth, were rotting after this hahha
I’m a sprit boy. Or shurlytempel
13:30 their camera glitched
I named my dog shasta before I even knew there was a cola called that...      my dog didn't taste as good as diet coke though
I'm just reallize that I just watch two humans talk about diet Coke for 24:31 minutes midnight because I have no better things to do.
Yeah. Aspartame really shouldn't be used as a sweetener. Not in the least part because it inhibits your body from absorbing other sugars, like from fruits.
18:20 Married couple flexing their synchronicity
I knew the sprite at McDonalds tasted sweeter and more carbonated
There is a cola brand here in the North West called RC Cola and its alot better than most sodas in this area. Its very nice to drink and enjoy with foods
"i quit diet coke"  We did it bois impossible has happened
My dad is just as big of a fan of Diet Coke as mat pat
The 2.5 liter of Shasta is always watered down, it would be unfair to use that instead of the cans.
I looove dr pepper. I don't do diet sodas but I did have coke zero sugar which was a bad after taste but when I tried it in cherry it was barely a huge noticeable difference. I still religiously drink Dr pepper but if I wanted a "healthy" choice is coke zero cherry
Why does MatPat look like a Bri'ish chav in the thumbnail
Also it’ll be great for your budget!
D: other. I would call it fizzy drinks/ juice.
I'm 7
I’ve heard of food lion matpat and I’m from new york
There a there is a Dr pepper cola it's RC, Royal Crown Cola
Ohio. POP! DEFINITELY
I call it soda pop.
coke Zero is my fave
Gah ... #friggered by the choice of fountain diet coke. Every single fountain machine can be completely different in their flavors depending on how they are calibrated.
15:29 A
D:Othe because I am from another country:D
MatPat: Stops drinking Diet Coke Coca Cola: *Not Stonks*
You should try "Vita Cola" from Germany, it's no Diet Coke but it taste really interesting Greetings from Germany
I do not say just pop or just soda I say soda pop
Plot twist! Pepsi is a NC soft drink too!
I can't believe it, what did you do with MatPat?!??!?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM!?!?!!?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B but also a little bit of C, because Steph is right. I don't know why southerners do this. I've tried to grow out of it
0:56 and psychopath mario
Pop Soda Coke Other  D. Other, We just say Fizzy here
First of all, I'm from the Midwest, and it's SODA. Secondly, diet A&W is the BEST. Screw cola, and get you some of that instead!
A
A&W is the best soda ever
Me when I see the episode name : *”THIS IS MADDNESS!”* My friend who doesn’t watch you : “What?-“
U should try to Publix brand cola I’m addicted to it
This would have been great with an announcer
Pop
I call it soda "sody pop" for some stupid reason
If you need a new soda, if you live around the Midwest then I recommend Sun Drop it is a Citrus Soda made in Wisconsin, trust me it is worth drinking plus I dare you to pin and leave a heart on this comment
I don’t understand how you somebody can give up the sweet taste of Diet Coke Zero sugar with a sweet hint of fanilla
Coca cola theory
Pepsi
Pop
In conclusion mat drinks too much diet coke
Watch your mouth Coca-Cola is the best
I work at Harris Teeter, and I will say that their store brand goods are for the most part good. So I'm not surprised it won it's fist two rounds. :^)
Im drinking diet Coke as I'm watching this
Matpat quit diet coke  Me:    Impossible
D. the name of the soda / pop / coke
Seriously another diet soda? For a smart guy your a stupid healthy choice maker
People are still trying to figure out why coke cola stock plum otter and Harris teeter stocks have soared.
Plot twist he is being sponsored by krogers
Pop
In australia (at least where i live) its called soft drink
I checked the ingredient lists and nutrition facts of both the Harris Teeter zero calorie cola with my local Kroger Big K cola oh! and sure enough, they were the exact same  Edit: corrected soda flavor
Wait... Its called Pepsi zero there? Over here in Britain its Pepsi max
Mat pat do 3 theory episode next Friday about coke food theory game theory film theory 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
this is the greatest tragedy in the history of humanity
Pop all the way. Midwest gang!
pop
Why is the video kind of glitched
I'm a mix of soda and coke, sometimes I say soda more but sometimes I say coke, probably because I live in the south.
*cough cough* idk about y’all but....they called pop/coke/soda whatever were im from a DRinK 😳😳😳
Soda
B
All I can do when I look at that table of Diet Soda, is dry heave.  Because I. Cant. Stand. Diet!
I doubt he will read this, But to make it better, leave them in the fridge and get them cold to make it better.
From just reading the tagline, I say..   WHAT?!
Honestly it's probably best that you're quitting diet coke I used to dump flat stuff into the toilet and it would literally clean the toilet. If it's that acidic on toilet messes just imagine what it's doing to your organs
hey matpat where can i get one of those red jackets in 3xl
Welp... I guess that rules out the much sought-after Diet Coke Sponsorship for any of MatPats channels.
No coke 0
Look at the subtitles at 3:45
I’m in the south west of the UK, we either call it fizzy or just the name of the specific drink
none of those stores are in my town
Yes❕ Steph and I are in the Coke zero group
Him: diet coke Me: DRINK THE JONES SODA
Fizzy drink or soft drink
I say pop not soda
My family always said soft drink
Guaraná is the best option
why is there a flash at around 13:30?
My dad would be really sad to see Shasta do so poorly.  Meanwhile, I'd prefer to never touch that stuff ever again.
I call them soft drinks
C
I can’t stop staring at the renegade hair on Steph’s forehead.
The drink that was supposed to be a filler bests the entire competition, including the original contender. A true underdog
13:30
I'm just finding it hard to believe some people don't know what Harris Teeter or Food Lion is lmao
-plot twist:- the title is a lie
By the end they are twekin on caffeine
13:30 that glitch made me expect FNAF.
You kids missed a "Shasta McNasty" joke
I prefer diet Pepsi, if we’re talking cola, but I’m more of a Mountain Dew guy, I don’t like Coca Cola in any of its forms.
What am I doing here?  I don't even live in the US nor I drink diet cola
18:58 perfect
Biggest upset in theory history EVAR loll
*pepsi in da corner be like 👁️👄👁️*
We're in the endgame now
Up in the Midwest I call it soda, I don’t know where your logic is
Soda
I've always  found that generic brand colas tent to taste more like Pepsi than coke.  So while I prefer Coca Cola I bet people who prefer Pepsi wouldn't be so against the store brand.
_In Australia I call it cool drink_ I like cherry tasting colas, so I'm hype about that grocery store cola haha
My mom is obsessed with Diet Coke as much as MatPat so I was really looking forward to an episode like this to show her (you guys might have a new fan) P.S. I also grew up in the Midwest I’m a pop guy
I am a D  ;)
what about Diet RC Cola
Harris Teeter is going to be skyrocketing in sales after this video
How about diet water I heard it was pretty safe to drink
I grew up calling everything pepsi
B
Have you ever had Krogers Pineapple Passion fruit soda? Hands down one of the best sodas ever and it was discontinued 2 years ago. Used to buy as many bottles as I could cause it was always sold out
If fountain diet coke won, how would you even manage to get it?
says, the world has ever tasted, "shows image of America in the background" >.>
ILlegal i havent watched yet BUT THIS TITLE IS FING ILLEGAL
We call it soft drink in Australia
The best replacement for Diet Coke is Coca Cola Lite      *;)*
Either way diet is worse for you hahaha, I mean soda is bad in general but diet is still worse lol 🤙
I'm from Kansas. Soda.
This is just a Preference, A Matt's Preference, thanks for watching my opinion.
Maybe just regular coke if not diet
I am B
It is good video. my favorite pop is Root beer. Please do cheese video.
b
YEAH STEPH, WE ARENT THAT FAR AWAY FROM Y’ALL IN NC, DONT FORGET  THAT FLORIDA MEN ARE ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY
Turns out the filler,  is the winner
I’m soda
Pepsi max / zero sugar woo
The underdog, the outsider, the spot-filler, the randomly picked product won! And by far!
B
B
Stevia is great, you just need to get used to it. I didn't used to like it, but the more you drink it the better it tastes.
In Australia we call them Soft Drink
See if you can replicate the original Coke recipe..
Man quits addiction by getting another   Man quits smoking by getting addicted to crack
Matpat: FOODLION WHICH YOUVE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF!  Me, who’s hometown is based on foodlion and McDonald’s: idk sounds familiar
At least we still have Steph in food theory.
tell me why I thought that this was gonna be a eat at your local restaurants ad the entire time.
The true finals should have been fountain Diet Coke and fountain Diet Pepsi 🤔 Fountain drinks always have the advantage...Not sure if you were being sarcastic or not but we have Food Lions here in Maryland.
am i the only person who saw a glitch or something at 13:31
0:32 Is that six pack of soda cans to the left of the cup labeled 2 missing a can?
as a pure-bread dyed in the wool southerner it is clearly coke you hethens
I feel like this should be a crossover with unemployed wine guy
Seeing as you can't really get the fountain version of Diet Coke at the grocery store, wouldn't it have been more scientifically sound to either use the canned or bottled version?
"Diet coke off" sounds like something else if you put your mind into it
SODA!!!! :D
Sarsaparilla soda is goood
Harris Teeter diet cola sales after this video: 📈📈📈
They have food lion in sc too
Coke
I’m British so I call it fizzy drink
pop although I picked up mixing it with soda after a few years in Georgia.
I grew up saying "soda" (grew up in AK). Now, at home with my husband, I use the term "sody pop". Still use "soda" when in public.
Drink Jeeru Soda.
I call sodas “those fizzy things” people get confused a lot.
That was the BEST rock-paper-scizzors game EVER. 😂
No it cant be true. Diet coke has been with Matpat for so long... Its been here for him in college it been here for his wedding, Matpat even played with its feelings once (and yes I do vividly remember mat pat gently caressed a diet coke bottle trying to find out its inner most secrets on a red heart bed its true)and even gave a best man speech, and he still wants to throw his best friend away like this?     Oh I actually made all this up with some deductive reason and past matpat videos the coke caressing part is true though. I can unsee that
I’m pop, us Nebraskans call it pop
Pop
You should try Manaos Cola, where i live it’s basically the ghetto coke lol it’s literally a fraction of the price of coke or Pepsi. I’ve never tried it, but people seem to like it (plus its cheap af)
Soda
I just call it pop
that look on her face  4:05
🅱️epsi masterace
Y'all don't like the taste of stevia, I don't like the taste of caffeine. Now I just need to do a blind taste test to prove it.
Find me a NukaCola Quantum and maybe I’ll consider switching my preferences
Frys (Kroger) soda is horrible.
B
Single blinded test should be double blinded.  You need to approach randoms and not explain the ladder.  That's the only way to have valid results.
I would recommend ginger beer. It is great as a chug drink and sip drink.
I love Zevia, but the taste it something you need to acquire. Stevia has a slight bitter after taste, and I find that carries over in the soda. there are other non-cola favors of Zevia that are good too. Findong out the whole foods 365 cola uses Stevia I might try a can. The other issue with Zevia is cost much more that diet coke. (BTW my non Zevia picks are coke zero, Diet Pepsi, then diet coke).
We all have bad habits matpat and his addiction to diet coke, me and youtube
I read this title and started to cry
I say soda despite the fact im English
its pop you store brand coke ripoff
i live in south Carolina and me and my family got to Harris teeter for all of our food and drinks and i love there diet cola nice to know I'm not the only one
*me seeing this thumb nail*: MatPat nOOOooOOO QuItInG DiEt CoKe tHat iS yoUr FaV DrInK :0
Everything is known as Coke down here. Gotta go Coke Zero all the way.
MatPat, you’re the one who keeps bringing up the Sans is Ness video.
WAIT! Steph does not speak for us all! I’ve grown up in Texas all my life and I’ve never called any soda other than coca-cola “coke”. It’s always been soda for me.
What about WATER THATS GOOD STUFF DRINK THAT
You didn’t pick Harris Teeter, Harris Teeter picked you.
It’s pop over here in Kentucky
We in the midwest do not call these delectable sugar drink "pop"! As a good colorado kid I know them as soda!
Series idea: diet coke vs other sodas?
I like how your replacing cola with cola with fruit
I prefer diet Pepsi over coke
How bout some 🅱️epsi
Soft drink
Down here in texas its coke or soda
Well this is not sus
In the netherlands we have freeway cola, its been underrated but i like it and prefer it over pepsi and coca cola
I- MATPAT LIVES IN NC?!?! AYE
Me, seeing this while I'm drinking diet coke👁👄👁
Whaaaaaaaaaa
No Diet Mountain Dew disappointed
Didn't you take any lessons from wine tasting sessions?  You're supposed to taste the drink, then spit it out in a seperate cup to lessen the effect on your body.  That way you don't get drunk/affected and can keep tasting for longer!
Wow. I never thought he would pick anything above diet coke, this year is gonna be a strange one😂😂
can you do this with only dr.pepper sodas next?
5:36 I  can’t believe that you called Diet Coke garbage
I'm surprised that there's no diet dr pepper
"Soda" and "Pop" I've heard used with nearly equal frequency in my life in Kansas City.  I tend to argue "Soda-Pop" is the "right" way but "Soda" and "Pop" are just short-hand for it.  "Coke" though as the generic term is IMO objectively wrong.  "Cola" would be a better generic name, but even then only for Colas, not like Sprite or Orange Crush.  Also that Rock-Paper-Scissors bit was great!  Hilarious!
I literally called soda stuff that was like a clear drink like Sierra Mist, and pop was a dark drink for me I called Papas and Diet Coke or Coca-Cola or Pepsi
Can you imagine your at the store and you see some guy walking to Checkout with 16 different soda packages and you just think to yourself “this guy has a problem”
I say soft drink, in the uk we use none of those words.
Stephanie!!! I MISSED YOU 🥺🥺
When my family finally goes down to visit my relatives some time (like half have got their first vaccination dose, so we're on our way) I should harass my dad - the Diet Coke drinker of the family - to try the one from Kroger's, lol.  We don't have any of the Kroger's owned chains within half an hour of us, but my mom's side of the family goes there regularly.
This is cool like cola .
I'm a B: soda
A food theory to us, a food fact to you.
pop
Still Coke Zero for me! Here in the Philippines, this is the only cola/softdrink that I usually drink here for more than a decade... 😅
How about water
15:25 Where I’m from we does called it sweet drink
7 up ;)
Im really sad that they didn't put my favorite drink diet dr pepper but I'm just surprised
Soda.
Literally watching this while drinking Coca Cola
Man, I love Sweden but I just can't find these diet sodas anywhere! Yea I got diet Coca-Cola and diet Pepsi and such but I whant the other ones in this video! Like the winner! Local store branded sodas. Now that I think of it, I dont think we have store branded soda in Sweden. Correct me if im wrong but I have never seen a "ICA" or "Coop" branded soda. (ICA and Coop are Swedish stores like Wallmart) Not even ICA Basic... Thats a new buissnes idea for them!
I think what he had some serious brain damage.
I’m a fellow Ohioan and say pop
Wait I live in Virginia and we have food lions everywhere, I thought everyone did 😂😂
I only order coke anyway, so I’m coke
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I like how this is the longest video he made on this channel
im coke
Diet products are typically really bad for you. I'm super allergic to aspartame and I just don't think it's worth it ditching sugar for possibly dangerous replacements. If you do pick a diet soda, diet Pepsi at least uses sucralose, which isn't as bad as aspartame.
For me, I will always and 100% be B: Soda
B
HANG on, is it just my phone or am i seeing wierd random glitches in my video?
How to get rid of a drug addiction? Get an addiction to a stronger drug
Did anyone see the green flash on the screen around 8:09 to 8:10. Also, from 13:30 to 13:31
I wanna try it now
I am soda, even though I live in the Midwest.
I grew up in the south so every sodas referred too as coke, but me personally I refer to them as sodas.
my dad nearly had to have a kidney transplant cuz of diet coke.
When I saw this vid I felt so happy for matpat
I’m a Pop type person and I like Coke and Pepsi so they should make a mix of Coke and Pepsi so it is just one product
I quit soda a year ago too
Coke just lost one of their biggest fans
Coke everything’s coke
I'm an Ohioan like Mat, so POP FOR PAPA!!
There is an imposter among us. Where is the real mat pat.
Good bye good meme and drink of matpat choice
B
looks like you are running out of ideas mat xD
But what about people outside of USA?
Am I the only one getting little green glitch flashes every now and then?
no way
My favorite cream soda comes from Boylan, so shocked by their diet coke
Me, chilling in Switzerland with my Milbona Choco-Drink: Interesting xD
Goodbye Diet CokePat.  Onanother note, did anyone else notice flickering green horizontal bars in the video?
I enjoy Bundaberg Root beer
I drink zevia coke because it has nothing bad in it
I know it is similar to Pepsi, but have you tried RC cola if you have it there.
:O Impossible!
when you said dr.pepper was out of the question, I tell you, I almost CRIED. dr.pepper is basically my life support
Who knows Fatmat That was the old days
It’s Pop!
But the diet coke jokes here the hole channel
Honestly, I'm thinking about doing this same test but with regular soda
I live in Maryland where most people call it Soda. However, my parents are Michiganders so my sisters and I grew up calling it Pop at home.
im happy we get to see steph again. we wont be able to as much since a lot of the theories he makes on game theory are animated
I just had Pepsi this morning because my friends father worked for Pepsi so I got it and I was thinking I was betraying Matt cause he loves diet coke. I guess not
Have you tried nuka-cola
Wow, 1 of the most shocking things of YouTube history. MatPat breaking up with Diet Cola
What happened at 13:31
What's with the weird static in places in the video? 13:30  for example. ...This have anything to do with DAD? Or Crow? LOL
pls i love diet coke and everytime someone says i'm weird for that i feel like u validate that
i live in southern southern louisiana and i just say soda. it’s pretty much only the old people who still call even sprite “coke”
Pop gang Ohio
Here where i live we have this off brand grape soda, wich easily beats the fanta by taste/price/volume
21:20 I feel like Matpat is about to create a full PowerPoint slide for his newfound love. 😶😶
In Nebraska we say soda, pop, and soda pop, but we really don’t care for the most part(as long as you don’t call everything coke)
I can't believe the diet pepsi that I drink like 3 cans of a day went out on the first round. oof.
This is not a theory.
Wow I didn’t realize mat moved from California to North Carolina
Get rid of your old addiction and get a worse addiction good deal
Food Lion is only really in NC?????
What was up with that static at 13:29?
IMPOSSIBLE
I have always called it "Soft Drinks"
D:Other. Always known it here in Australia as softdrink. And I’ve never stopped to analyse that 🤣
In the UK, it depends on the context. I grew up as a pop man in the East Midlands. When I went up north it was pop or fizzy drink when talking to people, soft drink or soda when I worked in a bar and soft drink too when in a restaurant.
Try sprite! It's green and fits your logo perfectly!
a someone in NC, good job food lion.
I LOVE HARRIS TEETER, I worked there for 6 months!
as a transplant from NY to FL ... i completely agree with stephs qualification of the south east... and FL... 1 people are SERIOUS about their publix here.. and 2  and more importantly .... we've all seen florida man right lol.. I've never had boyland cola but their creme soda is on point
soda
How hasn't this dude have cancer yet the dude drinks diet Coke like every day.
Kroger pop is fairly bad so i doubt it
"...Food Lion, which you've probably never HEARD of..." *Laughs in North Carolina*
Mountain Dew Voltage is objectively the best soda.  Edit: Now that I see the premise, cans are the best version. 20oz bottles are also acceptable. Fountain Dew (the original Mt. Dew from a soda fountain) is far worse than a can of the same soda. Cola is gross!  Edit 2: Soda is the only correct answer. I live in a place where over half of the population errantly calls it "pop," and it makes me want to pop them in the jaw.
Bro, me and everyone other brown person I know calls it all pepsi
I’m from the Midwest and have mover heard anyone call it pop, it’s always been soda for me. Then again, I live in Chicago so I’m not sure how cities factor into dialects
Im a D i call it sodapop
diet-rite got the diorite treatment
I saw this and went nooooooooo!!!
I physically cannot turn on the Bell notification icon. Does anybody else know what's happening
The seeding was complete bollocks in the voiceover
food theory? ARE YOU FING KIDDING ME WRONG CHANNEL this is a drink theory, period.
24 minutes of Matt and Steph trying types of pop and chatting?  I must be in heaven
YOOO ANOTHER FAMOUS YOUTUBER FROM/LIVES IN MY HOMESTATE! FIRST RHETT AND LINK THEN MRBEAST AND NOW MATPAT
WHAT LIES. HES LYING HE WOULD NEVER
The fact that it’s DIET soda means your going wrong somewhere
OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
MatPat literally always talked about drinking diet coke, this truly is a magnum opus of the Channels.
*impossible*
B. Soda
B: SODA
What is with the green flashes?
f
he really could quit when he wanted to       it took something else to replace it but he could
I’m pop because I’m British
Is it me or is the opening getting faster and faster?
mat diet coke has ingridient that is very dangerous called aspartam
I grew up with a Harris Teeter literally right behind my small neighborhood in North Carolina. Could take a small walk behind my house in case we needed something immediately
Glass coke is the best!
I call it soda
A: Pop
This is more controversial than, like... ANYTHING
5:28 I think the foundtian drink being the best only applies to diet coke. Or maybe even just diet drinks in general? because when its not diet, the can is much better.
I thought this was CLICKBAIT!
Mountain Dew is the best soda
Oh no..
D: In South Africa we generally refer to soda as "cool drink."
It’s cute how Stephanie calls you Matthew :)
Pop
MATTTTTTTTTTTTT WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
I've watched every single food theory and at least once my brother has interrupted all of them
logo of Food Lion reminds me of 90s central european supermarket called Delvita, now extinct.
This felt like good mythical morning
D: Other, we call it soft drink here
Mat gave diet coke a slight advantage in the beginning by choosing the fountain version. Soda fountains are usually calibrated to the preferred taste of the employees at the location by coke technicians. Even though they're supposed to be set at a company standard.
We say pop here in the UK
Arizona here soda, pop is wierd because most sodas do not pop anymore
I had to check the calendar to make sure that it wasn't april fools day for this.
Harris Teeter sponsorship when?
And Florida
Matpat giving up diet coke... suuurrre
The problem here is that you don't cleanse your palette between each one, so the previous drink affects it's competitor :(
Where my Hydro Homies at?
Ya know it is sorta hard hitting the sub button when you are already subscribed but just me you deserve a matpat on the back good job.
I'm other, we call it fizzy drink in Australia  🇦🇺
I saw i quit diet coke AND IMMEDIATLY CLICKED OFF MY VIDEO
Impossible.
Coke after this videos:📉📉📉📉
Wait you live in North Carolina, I thought you lived in California
It’s soda, pop sounds like an old man, and coke is a brand 😂
Summit Diet Cola from Aldi is pretty good and has no artificial flavors.
Match 2 of choosing: I have just one word for the loser of that one: DISGUSTING
B: soda all the way!
I don't know where Mat Pat is from but without looking I'm going to say the Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota region. He says the word both like it has an L in it. Bolth. 16:05
You should switch to “Diet Soda Stream” instead, it has no artificial sweeteners and zero sugar.  It also is made in a reusable strong clear plastic bottle that’ about 10’ inches tall.  Plus Snoop Dog was in a commercial promoting it, so you know it’s good.
I LOVE Kroger’s Cola-oh! It’s their version of Coke Zero. Cheers for Kroger goodness!
Publix Cherry Cola is better the CocaCola Cherry
14:10 Belgian viewer here. I can recognise the logo on that "Food Lion" bottle anywhere. It's Belgian. Probably part of the Delhaize group.
I think that food theory has become my favorite Channel because you guys do all these cool real life experiments and taste tests 😍
Breaking News : Man ends his coke addiction, uses a different brand coke instead
I grew up saying pop, but I converted to soda when I moved to DC.
Here in Scotland it is called fizzy or juice
This is lovely !! :
The title says i quit diet coke so he found a better one.
I live in SC so I know each and every single store you mention
My family says cold drink but i just say soda
Impossible.
Marylander here; Food Lion and Harris Teeter are both 5 minutes from my house. Also, Soda.
Anyone else notice the "Screen glitch" at 8:09 to 8:10 and 13:30 to 13:31
Wait, how can fountain even count? Taste of fountain sodas changes based on syrup to water ratio. Also, all those brands you had as contenders aren't available in fountain. You should have stuck to cans and bottles only.
Dr pepper
As a fellow Diet Coke addict, I loved this episode though I will argue that canned DC is the best, with the Coke Freestyle fountain being the WORST.
I’m trying to cut out diet soda to become healthier I was really hoping this would be a helpful tip video to cure my addiction 😩. Still great vid!
You know your from new England when you know the straws are from dunkin
Should do this again but with Tea. Sweet tea is godly
*Sees title* is it the end of the world?
B: Soda
MatPat prefers a cola that's NOT Coke.  Something's changed in the Matrix!
Coke is Coke Pepsi is Coke Dr Pepper is Coke Sweet Tea is Coke Water is Coke In the south it's all Coke
Me after reading the title:" a yes clickbait." Me after watching the Video:"WHAT!"
this would be better on april 1st
My preferred brand of choice is Virgil's brand.  I prefer to avoid aspartame and it tastes significantly better than the stevia sweetened version. (zevia)  Virgil's uses erithrytol.  Moreover it's readily available at Target in NC, unless you live in the sticks somewhere, you missed on this one.
You know what, maybe the secret ingrediant in the crabby patty, is citric acid....MATPAT you got a new theory to do now, What is the real secret ingrediant and is it citric acid?
Anyone else getting weird green glitches/artifacts? I also got them on the Game Grumps episode today... Weird
Theory idea: do carrots improve your eye sight? And are there any other vegetables that would improve your other senses?
*sees title* What?! Impossible...
May looks kinda like star lord in the red coat.
Dr pepper?
I call it soda pop, mix of both
Why did he have to change he has loved it so much
As an avid lover of Dr. Pepper. The play-in game is something that definitely also applies to it as well. Fountain is the far superior way to drink soda.
no.... its not possible..... NO!
c
Guys, I think something is wrong with Matpat...
using fountain for the coke and vs bottles and cans was a lil unfair. i feel it shouuld of been bottle to bottle can to can
I like zevia better then coke
Soda
What they should have done, is mark all the bottles with numbers, then had matching paper cups but with the numberson the bottom, poured the drinks evenly, put them on a lazy-susan to ki d of randomly spin/mix them up, then put them on the bracket. Taste them all until there is only 1 winner. THEN looked to see what number/brand it is.  Just knowing that the one you hold is a thing can sway your judgment. Test have shown some people will drink what they think is coke/Pepsi, based on if the cup is red/blue.
Here we have a food lion in South Carolina
Diet Coke got NTR'd.
I should try this with Dr. Pepper, I'm almost identical to Mat with pop just with Dr. Pepper instead of Coke
Ohhhh that be hard to do boi
OH GOD McDonald’s Diet Coke is the BEEESSST. Also I say soda not pop
YouTube REALLY wanted me to watch this I couldn’t ignore this video
I generally like Harris Teeter/Kroger/Fred Meyers brand foods and drinks.
its fuhing raw you donkey
It feels good to be a North Carolinian today!
Unpopular opinion: Dr Pepper > Cola
Pepsi Max rocks. Best soda on the planet.
20:45 Wow 😯 such ✨passion✨
coke wouldn't sponser mat
The first thing I thought when I saw the title was “yeah right”
I am soda
So you’re telling me matpat knows about menards?
Here in small town Nebraska we call “soda” fizzers
anyone else notice the glitch at 13:31
i grew up next to a kroger, never imagined it to be as big as it is
B soda
As someone who worked as a cashier at harris teeter, it was the worst job I've ever worked at. But dang their soda was really good.
Here in Texas, we use coke or soda. I hear both all the time.
I can't even handle artificial sweeteners, but this is interesting
Food Lion might be known in some european countries as the shop Delhaize
With the kind of stubbornness that Mat and Steph showed in that Rock Paper Scissors battle, who needs paper or scissors? Just call the game Rock and NEVER WIN.
I can't unsee that piece of hair on Steph that's trying to go to the other side.. 😅
diet dr pepper is superior
Hey, Matpat! I work in a Kroger, so I’m glad I watched this video. I’ve been drinking diet pepsi for a while, but thanks to this I think I’ll try out the ol Diet Big K i walk past every day. Thanks!
I'll be honest, I prefer my local store brand root beer over any other. partially because its the one that doesn't give me beer breath and partially because it has a good balance.
Diet Coke: I trusted you!
Steph: You cant  have diet coke be half the bracket  Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi zero: o_o *- *o_o
we really need to get on that citric acid conspirancy now
I do not like the taste of Diet coke
It's not Pop in the whole Midwest.  In Eastern Wisconsin it's soda.
Down in Texas we call it sody not really it’s just soda
just gotta say the more he talked about harris teeter diet cola, the brighter it got outside
Soda water.
As soon as he mentioned Harris Teeter and it’s bottom seed status, I knew it would win
We aren’t THAT chaotic...
Great vid mat but like as a European there are no real kruger stores
As an Alabama native, I go with C. I call everything Coke. Except for Mtn Dew Code Red and Mtn Dew's Watermelon soda. I call those abominations to good taste. Well, that, and Papa John's.
I say soda
Something to replace Diet Coke with? How about Water? I suggest Water, very good beverage.
i am coke lmao
What is up with the flash at 13:30?
what X-X
o7
I was listening to Boss 1 from terraria when I saw the thumbnail
oh my god something terrible has happened if MatPat quit Diet Coke
My God.
I'm a "soda" person from Missouri.
What about Diet Pepsi? :)       ;)
I got a Soda Stream for my birthday and I LOVE the caffeine free diet cola mix. I also really like the diet ginger ale and the lemon-lime. Plus it's so much cheaper
Boy oh boy I can tell that Matpat is from my neck of the woods when he says ‘Krogers’ instead of ‘Kroger’
In terms of just diet sodas in general, we all know the actual people's champ: Diet Mountain Dew.
Zevia is amazing-- It's how I have been caffeine free for 7 years. Only two of their flavors have it.
The apocalypse is upon us
COCA COLA
Soda
Im a b
For me it was d other I call it just drink or a word I don’t know how to spell my grandpa calls it that word
please matpat for the next theory channel make conspiracy theory channel please matpat for the memes
20 years from now I'm gonna have a son and if he asks me if I remember game theory, these will be my words The only things I remember about game theory is Matpats red jacket Their fnaf craze And most of all Matpats addiction to diet cola
I HAVE NEVER CLICKED FASTER ON A VIDEO
pepes pepes  MEN!!!!!!
The diabetes episode
Here’s a thought....how about NO sodas....PERIOD!!!
Me:*sees title* Also me:NOOOOOOO
This guy loves coke diet I love and drink coke zero Everyone has their own special drink
i love coke zero more then Diet coke meself
Other. Soda Pop.
ROOT BEER is the way to go and don't drink diet diet is worse for you than regular soda you might as well drink regular soda over diet if you're changing sodas root beer is the way to go because there's so many different varieties of it
Soda up here in ---- ----- --- ------
I'm kinda curious if the company that runs Food Lion also owns Hannaford's...a super market chain in the northeast. Their packaging is almost identical to Hannaford's packaging.  Edit: they do. Both Food Lion and Hannaford's are owned by the parent company Ahold Delhaize.
There are foodlions where I live
Did you know that diet soda is actually more unhealthy than normal cola?  That's for ruining all of my favorite shows.
but the sweet nectar of the gods
Omg those bottles are insaneely large
Matt: Food Lion. Me, squinting at the logo: Wait a sec, that's Delhaize!
me seeing the title of this video: Impossible!
i feel compelled to just hug that mass of diet coke
Its not Matthew Patthew any more, hes Mattrick Patrick
15:32 b soda in califonia we call all of it soda and specificly you'll call it coke
I'm a Coke boy, myself.
WHAT
The man has done the impossible.
Harris Teeter: Is cheap  Harris Teeter after mat Pat says it’s good: $$$$$$$$$$$$
The end of an era. Sad to see it go.
All mexicans C: Coke you fool its COKE
i totes forgot about ZERO from borderlands! Holy crap my old Ps3 is in my closet Ima go ahead and play that for nine hours and I'll be back....tommorow...Don't you dare JUDGE ME
Listen every now and then Pepsi will come out with crystal Pepsi, I am a 2000’s baby and I love the taste
Mat pat I know it’s not a diet soda but if you can, can you try Mr Pibb soda it’s my favorite
Who else calls them “soft drinks”
Things that will never happen Queen Elizabeth dies Scott Cawthon reveals all his secrets  Matpat gives up diet co..... well I guess anything is possible
Did he say Boylan was small?!?!?!
My mom drinks and obscure amount of Diet Pepsi so I want to see it win
in the beginning the forgot to add that mat created the "I JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHIPPED AND NAE NAED" meme
Maybe, You should do a food theory where you see if Diet Sodas are actually heathier for you than regular, or maybe even the opposite.
Soda for me
Personally i really like Mountain Dew Code Red! I drink about 1 bottle every month or so
As a person from the South, I can confirm that nobody (except for maybe the DEEP South) refer to soda as "coke".
My family is a huge fan of the Big K Diet Cola so I am not surprised that it would be the same thing as Harris Teeter. Kroger makes good stuff and I applaud your decision Mat Pat.
Fizzy Drink!
Sodaaaaaa!!!!
Am I the only one who vibes to the food theory intro I need to know
Dr. Pepper is one of my Favorites.
Soda also i love dr pepper
I thought the lived in california, not north Carolina
I call it coke or soda depending on what I'm drinking. I call cola flavors coke and everything else is soda.  Though because I'm living in the Netherlands I mainly use the Dutch word Fris (literally translates to fresh) or prik (because its prickly in your mouth)
Sand = ness?!?!??!?!?!!
PUBLIX GANG
diet soda stocks after this vid go *BRRRRRRRR*
BTW here in Australia, like a normal person would, we call them drinks. What a radical thought, I know!
TASTE TESTING ROOM TEMP DIET SODA. GROSSSSSSSSSSS. PS COKE ZERO WINS HANDS DOWN

DONT DO IT FELLOW MATTHEW
Wait I thought you lived in California
Food 4 less 🙊
Where is RC Cola? and Stars and Stripes?
once on coke always on coke
Am I the only one who calls it “fizzy drinks”?👀
you mean to tell me that Food Lion *isn't* in every state??!
For me, A) and D). sometimes call it pop, sometimes call it fizzy (and sometimes both, fizzy pop).  Also, vive cola from aldi could also be worth looking at for a coke substitute.
Let's face it Mat, you will never truly give up Diet Coke, you just added more soda variety to your diet
Should have done each round on a different day in order to make sure you have a fresh palate for each. Don't know if you did but it seems like you grew super familiar and confident with the brands unique taste very quickly which would have been harder to do if spread out. I think anyway.
Coke this is what happens when you dont sponsor him....
...Or just not drink diet soda?🤢
I mean I understand the addiction but still?
The lean glove typically book because relative biosynthetically spare on a womanly roof.  foamy, learned bowl

B I call it soda
Soda water/sparkling water
The Food Theorists doesn’t realize this, but he makes everyone’s quarantine better.
Citric acid episode
B, without doubt
D: all of the above
Speaking of the KFC episode, why haven't we seen an episode where you try to replicate a Krabby Patty as close as you possibly can Inn the hopes to one day open a real life Krusty Krab? Even if you don't find the exact answer wouldn't that be a fun topic to explore, that's ripe for food theorising! And tbh the answer will probably turn out to be citrus acids again or something.
Ah yes “I quit Diet Coke” my favorite theory
4:14 I have no idea if it's in the diet Coke version but glass bottle Coke. Glass coke.
All dark soda  REAL GAMERS DRINK MTN DEW, MATT
Dont be mean to coca-cola life its awesome
lol (haven’t watched the video yet) watch him go from diet coke to coke zero
MattPat: There will be no Dr.Pepper Me: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Mat food lion is a Carolina based grocery store
Future episode:  Hello internet!! Welcome to Food Theory!!!  Today's sponsor is none other than the March Mattnes winner, and the best underdog since Rudy, Harris Teeter Zero Calorie Cola!!!
Too bad I live in Germany, won't be able to try almost any of them~
Watching Matpat and Steph taste testing different food was not something I expected to enjoy so much. Really glad they decided to start Food Theory
We miss you steph
I went to the teether down the street to try out their diet soda after this (704)
when they say it's to sweet it makes me want to chug a gallon of it down
Nooooo! It is a staple of your Channel. I have been watching Sense the start of film theory and it is just iconic
Diet coke tastes like water to me. Pepsi Max is the nectar of the gods. Fight me. Also I live in New Zealand, anything like soda is are called fizzy drinks.  Also also diet coke and pepsi do in fact taste different in different countries. What I thought tasted like NZ coke was actually USA pepsi.
I need an episode all about citric acid now
I'm surprised RC Cola didn't make it into this test.
Who is this man and where is the REAL Matpat
Diet mtn dew.
Soda or pop
Hey its steph!
It's called pop in the north US (and Canada) because if you leave it in your car in the winter it goes POP! and ruins your interior.
OTHER: in Australia we legit call them by their brand or whatever the most popular brand is. Like an esky situation. I think some people just also use the blanket term soft drink.
B
i said this a million and i'll say it a million more: IF YOU CALL SODA "POP" YOU ARE A MENACE TO SOCIETY      lmaoo i said what i said
You need to try cockta easy (diet), cockta is a Slovenian cola that was made during the USSR as a stand in for coke, and if my taste buds serve me right it is WAY better.
Coke for all time.
I'm a+b interchangeably
Everybody be gangsta until matpat quits diet coke
he used the Elon musk not a flame thrower
He really missed out on calling the competition mat patness
Geogia usa: soda
Me reads title without watching the video noooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Try Senku Cola?
Coke all the way
Zevia Cherry Cola is the best diet soda, way better than standard Zevia cola
is it just me or do the glitches in this video seem... intentional
18:58 You're caught in an impasse of logic. You've discovered the recipe for everlasting peace. Congratulations. I'm terribly pleased. I will give my bank details to whoever gets that reference, I'm counting on you MatPat my little nerdy compadre.
Drink Theory
A, B, and C
Pop or Soda?  Me: *Cries in Frizzy drinks*
Here in the uk,in the places I've lived anyway call it pop
Can you do a theory on the science of diet sodas and cancer. Cause I’m always told that drinking a lot of diet soda can give you cancer. Maybe a comparison to healthier options and what actually makes those chemicals so bad for you.
Soda. All the way
No wonder he didn’t get a sponsorship from Diet Coke
im unsubbing cuz violation of the court of diet coca cola laws
Some people around here call it tonic.
Pop i live in the Midwest
pop gang where you at?
Coke Zero easy best
I love Zevia
The zevia grapefruit one is a bannnnnnggggger! I'm not a huge fan of any of their other sodas but the grapefruit is so good
Didn't realize I ended up at a GMM episode 😂😂😂  OTHER mate. Sparkling water lol
running 3 channels finally broke matpat's brain
Mat pat I hate you you cursed me to wonder. Every time the video glitches I slow down the video and pause to find a hidden message. I watched it 3 different times just to look for something
Yall trynna do some ARG bs with them green and blue color blocks? Aight, I see you
Remember how Matpat said that the Krabby-patty secret formula was just a marketing strat? I think it may have actually been citric acid.
RIP Diet Coke.
I love coke
Coke
Is anyone as shocked as I am?
coke
No food lion is pretty big Form the money back to the food for people in need  The other store brand I have seen but its not as big
HMMMM DiEt PePsI
The king has been dethroned! All hail king Teeter!
everyone PANIC
The real question is  Is the Harris Teeter Diet Cola = Great Value Diet Cola in every Walmart across the nation
I like how this is the weekly video from Food Theory, when this is literally exactly how they do food tiers on Good Mythical Morning that is a daily show 😭😂
I never thought this day would come
Faygo

Diet Cherry Coke Zero is my go to diet pop and no all the other ones don’t even come close to satisfying my sweet urges without the needless sugar.
RIP DIET COKE
I live in North Carolina and I had no idea that other states didn’t know What Food lion was I do feel like Food Lion has the best knock off soda they I think I have the best sprite even better than original sprite
1:30 So this is the cola challenge: The Diet edition? Okay!
I heard Food Lion and I thought oh yeah that’s that grocery store downtown that we never go to
the diet coke addict is now a harris teeter addict wow can't believe it
My family is from NC I never realized food lion was only in nc, I’ve always visited and assumed that was just a supermarket in the south
RIP DIET COKE
I have seen a food lion here in Tennessee
For me it was D: Other. I just call it drink.
Im a mt dew fan myself
Food Lion is also in Tennessee and North Georgia
I just watched this whole video even though I don’t like cola
Using fountain Diet Coke but bottled/canned everything else is kind of cheating.
We have a video to remember, ill save this screenshot
Harris Teeter is the anime protagonist.
No king scooper? I wonder how far they go
I’m scared now the world doesn’t make sense anymore I thought 2020 was wack but now I’ve seen everything

Vanilla Coke Zero. Everything else is playing for 2nd.
I call it both Pop and Soda
D: soft dirk is me
100% Pop.
Is it just me or does McDonalds Diet Coke taste WAY different than other fountain Diet Coke?
When I saw the title of  this video I was like... I MUST BE ON A DIFFERENT  TIMELINE
A
i am the guy that calls it soda
The moment when you get a Pepsi Max ad right before the episode
You WHAT!?!?
Me when I saw the title: :○○○○○○○○○
Again?
North Carolina you say? Did you enjoy the storm?
Mat Pat I’m surprised you and your wife didn’t have to go to the bathroom after drinking all that soda:(or as it’s called here cola), and Kroger used have stores here till the people that own that company decided to not have them here, and eventually Harris Teeter bought all the buildings that used to be Kroger, well some of them, there is one building that used to be a Kroger, and then they moved out and then it became a shoppers paradise, and then that closed, and the building was torn down and a Walmart supermarket is there now, I thought I’d let you know, and there food lions stores here, and I’m familiar with them, and Harris teeter too.
Some one should really look into the glitch things that happen every once and a while in this video and see what it says or points to
The rant he goes on at the end as he declares he’s leaving coke
Why not sprite?
*MatPat, heresy...*
Ive never, ever, heard of Coca Cola Life       Also my favorite soda is Coca Cola Cherry Vanilla
Mat pat:let's get pourin  My dirty mind: 0-0
Next time u should try Faygo diet cola
A!! From the Midwest.
I heard rumors that matt relapsed hard after this video.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families affected
The other, Other thing that this theory channels is famous for: giving up figure out Mario's height, it's okay you made like eight different videos, it's understandable.
Conspiracy!!! The Fates have spoken and the Nectar of the Gods I a food chain Soda?!?! I tip my hat... (Check to see if he's a alien later)
Nooooo root beer
Me, who only drinks juice: interesting
I'm just wondering what would happen if they added Wegmans into the mix
SODAAAAA
It's ALL Coke!!!  When I was a little kid I used to get upset when cashiers at fast food restaurants wouldn't ask "what flavor of coke" I wanted!!!  That said, in this world, COKE ZERO ALL THE WAY!!!
nooo
Matt Pat stopped drinking Diet Coke?  I need to call my broker and sell my stock then.
we call it fizz in nacogdoches
Hi! We actually kinda did this to just a little different and for different reasons.
Soda
I don’t give 2 shits soda is the only correct way to refer to the sugary bubble drink
My dad taught me a very important lesson: If you go to a specialty place, get the special. No lasagna at the crab shack.  Boylan is awesome for their regular sodas - their diet sodas are not good, and not what the brand is about. Just like how the hot wings at the sushi restaurant are likely to be the worst wings you ever have, going to a brand that is all about that old time cane sugar for a diet soda is not going to turn out well.
Are the glitches a code?
Food lions are real popular in TN and KY. And I would never touch Diet Coke, I'm a Dr. Pepper kinda gal, and maybe Coke. Wouldn't touch Pepsi either, it's gross
When they did rock paper my brain literally went that's how you know someone has been married for a while when they pick all the same choices 6 times
Graphic glitches or secret code hidden in the color codes?
ah yes the 4 genders  "Pop"  "Soda"  "Coke" and of course "Other"
"Would you like a coke?" "Sure" "What kind of coke do you want?" "Coke" "Sorry, we only have Pepsi"
So excited to see Publix mentioned!
As a SE American, I am so proud of my boy Harris Teeter ; - ;
I’m A
I keep forgetting you now live in North Carolina.
Diet doctor pepper is amazingly good
the southern store brands are better because they can't milk people's money because of there popularity and making it with cut corners like bigger brands would mean it goes under
I just had to give up Diet Coke for some meds I was put on and picked up the caffeine free stuff. Surprisingly, tastes the exact same
Is it me or the screen glitch at 13:30 because idk if it was intended or not
Welcome to Citric Acid theory
In Ireland we call soda just fizzy  or a soft drink but mainly fizzy
DO AN EPISODE ABOUT CITRIC ACID
Pick 'n Save used to be called Copps before it was bought by Kroger. I miss Copps.
I know its propably impossibel for you guys to get one bottel of this, but screw it. You said to tell you any other kind of Cola that is really good.  SO, try Fritz-kola. Really good. And made in Germany. Should be a "But", but that just makes it better. Because everyone know we germans are the best and make the best.
They keep drinking it too. It's terrible, let me hit that one more time. 😂
(A) pop
Fnaf math diet coke pat
Here in Australia, we call them "soft drinks", I think it was originally to differentiate them from "hard" (alcoholic) drinks?
😳😳😮😨😵😶
Rip Diet Dr pepper winning
Up here in Canada you will never hear anyone say soda it's always been pop and it always will be pop!
D. soda-pop
May pay after drinking bottling sodas he becomes French oh Hoya Hoya hoya
I've never had soda in my life. Only thing in a can I've ever had is Brisk lemon iced tea lol
All of 2020 👏👏👏 impressive
coke
If you have a cola that was originally made in New Jersey and is not sold in New Jersey, it’s gonna be bad, and Jersey people are willing to eat the majority of things
Imma a Soda
Coke
We drank Meller Yeller down here in Georgia.
Matpat quitting diet coke? I think the worlds coming to the end
I never thought I would ever hear those words out of his mouth, ever.
Pop 100 and ten %
If MatPat ever commits from not having any more diet Coke I’m sorry but that’s too far
I drank a Pepsi while watching it
Food Lion is not a rare grocery store, it’s literally the only store I go to
Water.
Sarsaparilla
I go pop it gose pop
I say coke unless I need to specify the drink I want
Pop is what I call it
Me: *sees title* Also me: That's illegal
who are you and what have you done with mat?!?
At least you won't die to coke-a-cola
B: Soda
Sody-pop
I'm from the south and I can confirm that we call all of them coke

Title: I QUIT Diet Coke Video: I'm addicted to a new diet cola
My favourite brand is jones they are quite good.
"extra fruityness" Maybe try Diet Dr Pepper
Watermelon soda is underrated
I be pop
For all my fellow southwestern folks, Kroger is frys
I love how Mat made sure to tell us that Harris Teeter shouldn’t have even been in the contest so it felt better when they became the Cinderella story
NANI? IMPOSSIBURU>!
Nope, you're all wrong! Afri Cola it is!
I myself have never really liked diet coke. I like the original, but I prefer Pepsi Max. It's tasty and I don't believe it has any calories or ant sugar.
9:22 matpat gonna get killed from ricin
Coke
Question: I know they sell novelty root beers but do you know what Rocket Fizz is?
I want to drink Coke Zero now
I’m so confused. Why is my school mascot I’m your video? That blue devil can’t get past me  2:17
Matpat went looking for a new soda after all these years of asking for them to Sponsor him and them not doing it
Pro tip for coke replacements: cold water.
Big question, why does Steph get the shaft in all of these videos? She's always drinking or eating the worst food or drink in taste tests, especially during the spice episode. Just give her a cup of tea and let her enjoy herself.
Anyone still call it sodapop?
The fountain kind gets more sugar put into it in the restraunts
I am from two different states in the Midwest and almost nobody I know calls it “pop” it’s always “soda”
lies
im not from thr east but you made the good choice
Coca-Cola: Why would we ever bother sponsoring him? He's already giving us earned media anyway since we've got him as an addict.  2020 Happens.  Also Coke: No. It can't be. It's IMPOSSIBLE.
c
As someone who doesn't drink anything Cola flavored because it's all too sweet imo, I think the reason the old school brands failed is because they have to replace their staple of cane sugar for less healthy, newer alternatives in order to be "diet" which is just not something they're used to.
#antisoda
The real problem is enjoying a fountain soda
This was way more entertaining and enjoyable than it had any right to be.
Spoiler for the video         Bruh the one soda that was supposed to fill a spot in the bracket last second won
Why did the video glitch...
You bring up a good food theory: food with and without Citric acid- which is better?
Coca-Cola stock is about to drop
Question why does have  be diet
Only soda
commednt
Impossible
Diet coke: thank god he is not stalking me anymore and sending me werid mail
So I call it soda, but my Grandpa calls it sodee water.
the stars and stripes rip off cola is pretty good
Soda
He loves  Diet Coke, Gogurt, his channels, his wife, kid and his team
I’m say soda
I’m from Ohio and I say pop but some people say soda or soda pop
A to the max
Is it ever possible for MatPat to age?
The seeds should add up to 17... One versus 16 2 versus 15 3 versus 14 4 versus 13 etc etc
HE LIVES IN NORTH CAROLINA. WHATTTT. I THOUGHT HE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA
not gonna watch this one, i KNOW this has to be click bate.
Over here most people just say the brand name not pop or soda
Oh snap, matpat quitting diet coke? Time to dump Coca Cola stocks...
In germany we say Softdrink or just Getränk
12:21
Oh no        The world is gonna end oh no...
I'm a Pepsi and mountsindew drinker
In Alabama we call it soda and coke Personally I say soda
Diet Vernor's is my drug of choice. Highly recommend. I drink 3 or 4 a day!
Here on Earth 1610 we drink Koca-Soda, its amazing, spectacular, and some would even say sensational...
Pop
"I gotta be able to actually drink it on a regular basis." Picks Fountain Soda over versions that can be bought in stores.
*Smallest Violine on earth starts playing*
"Me in north Carolina"  all the stalkers "a ticket to north Carolina please"
My dad loves the cola oh zero sugar from kroger which is good cuz it is cheaper than coke zero
Food Lion is probably the biggest supermarket brand in the Benelux. Quite funny I didn't know they had stores overseas ...
aspitame gets alot of underserved hate because of paid for studies that exaggerate the bad parts of it. as long as you dont have a rare kidney disorder that limits your diet then it is perfectly healthy to drink
Fountain diet soda always tastes better lmao
Me: Sees title Also me: “IMPOSSIBLE”
Diet coke is a shitty name here in Spain at least is called CocaCola Light
Doesn’t surprise me that your store brand is Kroger. A lot of the Kroger store brand I prefer to name brands like their chocolate syrup.
C: Coke because I am from Texas. I bet that makes coke sales go way up since everyone calls every soda a coke
I'm what some people call a POP man
MEXICAN COKE IS THE BEST COKE DONT @ ME
I always used the term "soft drink" when asking for any sort of soda at a restaurant.  Not sure if that was a regional thing so much as a "I know people will not mix up what I'm asking for" thing, since I did a fair amount of traveling.    On another note, this episode actually has some WEIRD connections to my life.  Like, knowing about Food Lion despite not living in NC is one thing.  Only reason I'm familiar is because our family likes to vacation on Topsail Island, where that's the main grocery store.  But it's been YEARS since I heard the word "aspartame".  My mother is a fellow Diet Coke lover, and my father would occasionally have some, but it cause him pain afterward.  Turned out he was allergic to aspartame, and so we had to switch to the Diet Coke with Splenda you mentioned.  It was a dark day in our household when the local store stopped stocking it.
Not sure about the cola, but my grocery store is Fred Meyer, and all of their generic products have the Kroger label
Coke Zero is the best diet soda i've had and keep drinking it.
Citric acid is the secret ingredient to the krabby patty secret formula
Mat your the reason I drink diet coke. Thank you for this very objective test
D we call it just cola
1:00 I was thinking he did that one hollow knight thing
I had to quit Coke as well but more because I don't agree with their choices in employee training materials.
0:01 but neither soda company cares...
Huh. I may have to try out Kings' (King soopers') diet soda. Colorado/Kroger represent ;)
Steph's got it hands down.  I'm a Zero man, by far.  Zero Vanilla?  That's the beverage of the Gods to me, lol
In Pittsburgh it is called pop
The best coke is not even available in the US, soo... Good luck :p
DR.PEPPER ISN'T COLA?  NAH YOU GOTTA EXPLAIN THAT
that’s illegal
This is the biggest event in all have of History!
Later today: I’ll take a Diet Coke… AND DRINK IT. Phizzz
pepsi
I'm a midwesterner who says soda. Born in raised in Illinois and now attending school in Nebraska, I'm not sure I know anyone who says pop. MatPat, is it possible that says pop is an Ohio thing? Because I know a lot of midwesterners and they all say soda.
Team coca cola
YOOO THEY GOT PUBLIX BRAND IN THIS???? Edit: oh publix lost, dang it
You said Diet Coke so much that when I picked up my glass of juice it tasted so weird
I'm from Chicagoland and people I know call it soda.
So the flash at 13:30. Is that video compression, or some hidden message?
Men, they can't be loyal. After everything you've been through, Diet Coke was by your side, and THIS is how you repay them. SMH.
Dr. Pepper is the best
I have completely quit drinking anything but water and tea
Wait a minute. MatPat's preferred Diet Cola now is basically fricking Kroger's Big K? I remember drinking that forever ago as a kid because for a time my mother was in lower paying jobs. We got Big K instead of Coke, but I didn't like it as much then. Maybe they've changed stuff since then. It won't replace Diet Dr. Pepper or Root Beers for me, but I'd try it out if I get an itch for a diet cola.  Edit. First my mother got Big K Cola because she thought it was better, not because we were poorer. Oops on my part. Second, I finally tested my taste buds against Big K Diet Cola and fountain Diet Coke. I gotta say that if Harris Teeter is the same as Big K, then I say it's the better cola. However, I don't think it's the citric acid. Both Big K and Coke have citric acid in them. I instead purpose that it's not the citric acid but the carbonation that they use. To explain my FOOD THEORY I'll tell a story. Before going back to diet sodas after cutting and soda from my diet, I tried A&W brand mix with carbonated water. Tasted just like A&W root beer. I was using a Nestle brand of water for the mix, but when they didn't have any I used the Kroger brand of carbonated water. Weirdly to me then, I preferred the Kroger brand. Since it was cheaper and better, I just bought it instead. Now that I had Kroger's Big K Diet Cola, I can easily confirm that the carbonation is identical to their carbonated water. Now there might be more to it of course, but the fact that Kroger carbonation seem to not only be consistent but BETTER than others is something I can't overlook. But hey that's just my theory, my FOOD THEO- ok I'll stop right there.
I am Canadian. I get annoyed whenever someone calls it Soda. It is (or Canadians pronounce) POP!
Anyone else saw that graphic glitch at 4:06? I feel smart for seeing that because now I have reason to believe that there is a mystery behind this video, that i found a clue for. I don't care if it is just a glitch, don't take this away from me okay
*Breaking News* Coca Cola stocks drop by 60%
3:30 Good thing that's where I live
In New Zealand  we call it fizzy or soft drink never heard it being called pop i have heard of soda thanks to soda stream which in my opinion tastes awful if you ever come to Aotearoa dont ever drink value fizzy it is disgusting
In Canada and Ireland we call it pop.
Impossible
the biggest cap in history right here:
I actually had a really bad softdrink habit most my life. I’d drink 3+ Litres of Coca Cola a day. I ended up at 145kgs. I decided to give it up for a year a few years back and I’ve been incredibly careful about how much and when I introduce it again. But it was so bad I could tell which softdrink was being opened in the next room by the sound of the bubbles being released.   I’m so surprised you went with soda fountain diet coke though. I generally find them to have the least concentrated flavour (which is fine if that’s what you’re after but you drink a lot of it). For me, cans have always been my favourite way to drink softdrink. I actually really like that slight metallic taste.  Edit: that’s 319.67 pounds I was at. I’m now 108kgs (238 pounds).
But has he tried senku cola?
I call them “Soda Pops”
I grew up as Soda being called forbidden
1:28 One time my dad said “Do as I say and not as I do” and I responded “If you don’t do what you say, pretty soon you’ll run out of do’s.” That caught him off guard and I don’t know where I came up with that but I live by it now.
Diet soda's are not unhealthy.  Please stop perpetuating the myth that the sweeteners used are unhealthy or dangerous.
Im a sprite guy myself
13:31
i wonder if this video will directly effect coke sales
Living in South Carolina, I’ve heard of all of the NC brand stores haha. Also being born in Ohio, I instinctively call it pop, but my southern friends make fun of me for it.
My I be so daring as to suggest juice or water? Gotta set a good example for kiddo
Here is a stunning twist...I noticed on the book of the Face (otherwise known as Facebook)....The "Dr." finally is going Zero Sugar, joining Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 7up, Sprite, Mtn. Dew (which recently went Zero Sugar and even released a Zero Sugar variety of Major Melon)
LOCAL PUBLIX GANG
Matpat pust little hints in his video but ot always makes me panic and think my screen is broken
As a Norwegian i’m disappointed with Pepsi for not winning this
The “no signal” pop up queued to Matt breathing through his nose at 13:30 is such a subtle edit but bravo. I need to add stuff like that to my edits.
I honestly don't like diet sodas personally.  There is just something about my own biology that makes it to where the artificial sweetener tastes off or bitter.  Don't ask me what it is but I just don't like diet.  Anyway, interesting experiment.
I can’t get over this, Diet Coke has been matpats thing since the early fnaf days...
Me sees the title: WAIT WHAT
I call it soda but people I know at home call it sodiepop so yeah
“What kind of coke do you want?” “Crack” “Umm... we don’t stock that”
If you guys do normal sodas, DO DR FIESTA. Its a dr pepper alternative thats soooo good
I wouldn't be surprised if Mat made the Food Theory channel just so he could make this episode.
I love Sams Cola
But Mat... 1/5 of your YouTube Identity is created just by diet coke... (If you wonder: 3/5 are the 3 theory channels and the last 1/5 is Mats personality...)
They don't look cold. Please tell me they are cold
Mat trying to convince Steph instead of rock paper scissoring, he's a lover not a fighter lol
B:soda
He better get sponsored by one of these companies
Im from the UK where we are weird and call "Soda" "fizzy juice"
I actually work in Food lion's corporate. Just interesting it made it as far as it did.
I think the bottle one has more fizz
Food lion brand and harris teeter brand are awesome 😎
He was going to do this whether it was a YouTube video or not
I need a whole video on citric acid
I say coke so it’s C
Diet coke is the best it has been my favorite pop for the past 10 years  please don't betray team Diet coke
We have Food Lions here in WV lol
LETS GO I WAS ROOTING FOR HARIS TEETERS.
I'm also a pop man.
Glass is the best Compared to Bootle or can Though Bottle has a feeling to it Fontaine seems the best outside of glass  Glass is the hared to get The plastic Fontaine and then Can Based on who can get it   Fontaine is best Because ice But i get Can the most Bottle is also good
Me: *reads title** Also me: WHAT?!
You can tell the Whole Food's was bad because he *ate* it.
Of course first a bot misses then 2021 goes decently and matpat quits diet coke whats going on?!
Iv drank lots of Boylan sodas but never the diet ones, the others I can confirm are better
True diet soda: half water half soda. No chemicals that way
Is mat pat ok he loved diet coke
MatPat should probably stop drinking soda period if I'm being honest, I once heard Diet Coke was u healthier than regular coke
lol there were 2 #7 seeds
i am here to ask you to do a dream smp theory on the ranboo enderwalk ARG (:
Ok but can we get a video where matpat tries different sodas to see if theres another soda he likes?
Idk why I'm watching this I stopped drinking pop lol
Kuba Kola is the best one
Once again, Stephanie steals the show. Also pop.
Noooooo
Repping my fellow southerners with it being called coke(even Pepsi is coke)
I say fizzy drink as someone who lives in the UK. Anybody else?
Just note, the same products and the same labels made in different states... even if from the same company, you'll love one and the other might not the other.
In SA🇿🇦 we call it cooldrink/"coldrink"😁
I enjoy diet rite. Glad to see a food theory talk about aspartame that stuff is stupid levels of toxic. With side effects being depression
Were we clickbaited? Maybe a little but it’s Food Theory so I’m not mad
I recommend Diet Dr. Pepper.     Edit: Typed this before watching.
soda
BOOO FOOD LION! DIET PEPSI FOREVER! 😤
Me: Oh, a theory about diet coke. FINALLY!!  Also me: Wait, quit diet coke?! No way
Just Drink Water
Love that a lot of your vids involve North Carolina my home state
He looks like a John Mulaney doppelgänger in the thumbnail
Yessir, we love quitting racist coke👍
I have a feeling that Mat just made this channel for an excuse to do a mukbang        (This is a joke don’t be stupid)
Why did the screen glitch like 3 times
I used to live in North Carolina. I miss Harris Teeter - they're definitely not around where I moved in PA. There is a Food Lion, though.
We call flavoured carbonated syrupy drinks "soft drink" here in Aussieland. Personally, I can't drink it despite having a very strong sweet tooth. Carbonation feels like razors laced in acid in my mouth. Kinda sucks because soft drink is the most readily available drink whenever you go to any takeaway store. Gimme milk instead any day.
I can't stand diet soda except for the lemon lime sodas
there are food lions in maryland
Oh crap I grew up in the south and just thought that everyone called it coke. guess i'm just weird.
Do dr pepper
I’m southern and I’ve never heard people say coke in reference to all sodas-
The mature medicine postsurgically smoke because kangaroo continuously beam throughout a imaginary candle. puzzled, receptive insurance
food4less has the same flavor
Diet Pepsi
Once again another nostalgic childhood youtube hero that lost his quality. So long Diet Coke Pat ;-;
As an ex-Harris Teeter employee and someone who grew up with one a tenth of a mile from my house, I am glad it showed up and showed out.
abandon diet, zero is where the flavor is at.
Soda
B.
Diet Coke should of sponsored him sooner
Pepsi > Coke
What is Cola? What defines something being Cola taste? HOWTHEFUCKISDR.PEPPERNOTHERE?!!!!?!!!?!???
Why would you use a sports method in a pseudo-scientific experiment? It just doesn't feel accurate
Ok now here me out.... what about an anime theory?
y tho
Look I don’t care but I love Coke life, but it’s so hard to find!
It pains me to see this title.😭
Def Coke
matpat does so many great things for chairty god bless matpat and his friends
It cannot be
Yeah it's all coke where I'm from.
It's really disappointing that the Boylan Cola was a complete dud. I've never tried that one but their Red Birch beer is absolutely amazing. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try
If this doesn't show that anyone can overcome an addiction, I don't what will
Where I'm from their all fizzy juice
Pop
Literally NONE of those small chains listed at the end are near me 😅
I just had a soda stream dr p  today and all my friends were very sugar high after
We call it soft drink here when we’re not naming the brand. Usually it’s just I’m drinking Pepsi or Do you want a Fanta? But when referring to fizzy drinks in general it’s soft drink
Pop yo lol
Hey i also live in North Carolina
19:23 she got rinnegan?
Well... MatPat is about to be put into an asylum. That man can NOT live without diet coke... unless he just drinks regular coke. 😏
13:31. The heck are they playing at?
As soon as they started talking about the fruitiness of Harris teeter, i had the line from Worlds End in my mind "Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue"
I live in San Diego, CA and I’ve never heard of Harris Teeter.
We all love krogers and our pop! Let's go mid-west gang!
B: soda
Give this man a round of applause. He’s replacing his drug of choice with a new drug of choice  Edit: For legal reasons this is a joke. Dollar$ co. Does not condone illegal amounts of drug usage, remember moderation and inclination.
Hey, it's nice Steph knows which she likes most too now. Coke Zero and Harris Teeter Diet Coke a new Theorist HQ set of staples?
My dad and matpat could have a soda off
D. Bubbly/Bubbles
D soda pop
I think the reason the fountain coke was sweeter, is because the syrup and carbonated water are mixed as they leave the machine, that’s why there is a clear whiteish color stripe and a brown stripe coming out of the faucet, and the ratio of carbonation to syrup isn’t always exactly the same
has anyone noticed weird glitches on the screen? like they look like film damage or something like that. is this part of some weird ARG that  mat is trying?
you should make an episode all about citric acid.
Oh my god
im in the pop camp
I am Canadian and we have Faygo
My school (more specifically 5th and 6th grade, by the way I'm in 6th grade) is doing march madness where we have to PERFECTLY guess what teams will win, and the 5th grade teacher is SO confident that non of us will get all the teams correct that he will legitimately give his new expensive truck to the winner even though we're just children.  He has literally thrown his wallet at kids before for doing a great job in school.  Perfectly predicting a tournament is practically impossible, so I can see why he is so confident.
Idk how someone likes diet coke, it's disgusting.
The generic sodas are cheaper, so if you were going off a cost perspective you would save money getting the Harris Teeter soda then coke brand.
What is the weird flash at 4:06 ?
Well, a food-budgeter has mentioned multiple times when buying cheese, Kraft and store-brand are from the same factory, just with different labels. However, Kraft is more expensive to cover ads fees.
I used to work for The Red Wing foods Company In Fredonia Ny. After Ralcorp Holdings bought our plant, They changed our name to The Carriage House Companies. ConAgra then  bought Ralcorp Holdings.  Our product lines were (private label) store brand labels. Jam &Jelly, peanut butter, tomato products, syrups, mayo. I'm going to assume that MatPat might have actually grown up eating the very products I helped make.
I call it soda
In Washington state we tend to use SODA POP, rather then soda or pop. So D. Other.
Soda!!
This is true I work in a food factory here in the UK and 90 percent of products are the same with different labels and packaging only one thats stands on it is own is an American brand that has its own specific recipe
RC would have been a good one too try
I'm not kidding, I choked on my milkshake when I read that title and continued to cough for a whole minute. This title almost killed me.
Matpat: I quit Diet Coke   Everyone: Impossible...
A
13:31
Was this episode sponsored by diet coke?
I'm disappointed in MatPat for spreading aspartame FUD. The videos are usually well-researched and educational. All the evidence points to aspartame being safe and healthier than drinking soda with calories.
Pop
Maybe Dr. Fibb? Idk man
So diet coke 2 dropped?
They know what the two options are when they try them? I’d me much more interested if that source of bias was removed. Even if they don’t know which is A and which is B, they know that one must be X and the other must be Y
Love that he gets to do videos with his wife on this channel
Gonna be honest, feels like a 2020 video.
a
Sans is Ness is a great AU for Classic
Nooooooooooo!! You can’t just replace Diet Coke!
Wait, so based on how Matt and Steph ranked the top 3 drinks. Isn't it basically a 3 way tie?
I was majorly disappointed with the rock paper scissors method towards the end of the tournaments, really think there should’ve been a second control. That said I am delighted with the results of said method 😂
Im A: PoP
DR PEPPER BOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Other: Fizzy!
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATTPAT
Me:  reads tomb nail what sorcery is this!?!
This is the day of reckoning
Publix is also a store in the UK.
THIS IS NOT MATPAT!!!
Subtitles at 3:45
Bro ZEVIA soda is glared your just addicted to that crappy soda :/
STOP THE FNAF IS GETTING TO YOU
After watching this, I’ll have to pick up some harris teeter cola.  Also typically more a fan of Sun drop and Cheerwine. Both wonderful NC sodas :)
Matt is like a diet coke connoisseur.
I live in NC too, I’ve always thought food lion was a countrywide chain.
The video that shook YouTube
Its always great to see an addict try and return to sobriety
14:51 when matt forgets that pepsi originated from North Carolina...
Freeway cola
I'm a soda man.
I'm from the south, georgia in particular. But I say soda
If you told me like 3 weeks ago that matpat quit diet coke, I would laugh at you.
B/D in New Orleans we tend to call it soda, but restaurants ask what 'soft drink you want'/'what you want to drink.'
The 19 minute mark is proof that mat an Steph share a brain
Why does the screen keep flashing with random colors? (8:10 is one example, there were at least two others but I didn't catch the time for them)
14:41 never heard of? There’s a Food Lion 5 minutes away from my house and I have a Harris Teeter 2 minutes away!
He should try what my mom did to quit Diet Coke, she took original Polar seltzer and added True Citrus flavor packets for drinks. It’s good :) WARNING: it will fix up at first, put the cap on immediately!!!
You cant have fountain, bottle, canned cokes poured into a glass and then tasted, that ruins them all....you have to blind taste them with someone else holding them via straw, GMM did this and tried to vote based off of it, unfortunately, depending on the source, as soon as you re-pour, it loses tons of bite, and flavor....gotta redo it the right way without ruining your samples.  Same thing with them being open air....depending on how long they sit open air, they also lose more, so if you pour them and wait around to get to them, it ruins the samples.
I'm a soda boy (Northeast)
Well, this was unexpected
I'm sure this is a lie
i just say coke
B
Kroger, Ralphs, and Food 4 Less are all owned by the same company. The store brand in all those stores is Kroger. Side note, Dr. K (Kroger's Dr. Pepper) is better than Dr. Pepper, I will die on that hill.
Mat just licked the end of his straw. FILTHY :D
You could call it a fruity maze. (Amazing cheesy fnaf reference)
you can find something weird thing appear on screen when you slow down at 13:30
Okay, based on all the graphical glitches who’s going to work out the secret code that Matt and Steph are sending to us. My guess is they are telling us they are trapped and being forced to drink ungodly amounts of diet soda.
B L A S P E M Y
14:32 Me, a Virginian: I’m sorry, there are people who have NEVER HEARD OF FOOD LION???
I smell A.R.G.
Pop of course. O-H..
Bruh I live in Tn and there is a Food Lion here
was the only reasons for this episode to put hints for a new ARG and let mat drink all day
We used to have food lion in Oklahoma
my ears perked up when he mentioned Kroger, since I work at a Ralphs....
Me:I- is he actually going to quit it?!? Also me: now I'm interested
Let Austin curse it’s what makes him special
When they put the meme in the end of the episode, I almost fell out of my chair. Probably the best two episodes from Theorist land is the Panera Bread and this episode. Great Job, everyone!
This would have been bad for me, since I don’t even like Diet Coke
Cherry coke
This video should've been titled "Rebranding..."
For me in Middle England (the region is literally called the midlands, it’s where 90% of the fine bonechina and pottery used to come from but nowadays we have far less potbanks running as it’s cheaper to make it in the Asian parts of the world with cheap labour) its pop or soft drink with the odd smattering of soda thrown in for good measure.  I don’t know what it is with you Americans and your habit of calling stuff by one brands, soft drinks you call cola, nose paper you call Kleenex I can think of at least half a dozen more does marketing really have that much dominance on your life’s?
Dr. Pepper is superior. They have a doctorate!
I’m c.... I always heard it as Coke
IT’S TIME TO STOP
I am probably the only person that calls soda fizy drinks and i don't care what other people say
bye steph....
WOAH I FORGOT ABOUT HARRIS TEETER I GREW UP WITH IT AS MY GROCERY STORE FOR LIKE 9 YEARS TY FOR BRINGING THIS BACK
D. Sodie Pop
I work at harris teeter and idk why but this made me very hype
B.
I'm sorry. Since when did MatPat live in NC? I could ha e sworn he lived in Cali? Dafuq?
I've always called it soda, never pop, soda pop, and anything else. If it was Coke, it was called coke; Pepsi was Pepsi. But it was and is always soda in general.
Come to the sparkling water side of the force
Plot twist they weren’t actually diet sodas
why are there four yellow stripes at 3:04 ???
I wonder if they should had cleansed their pallets with water before tasting each soda.
Me seeing the title and rethinking everything i know.
Im finding those random caps in the description kinda sus
Put the speed at 0.25 and go to 8:10
I've stopped drinking sodas myself, and have switched to seltzer.  It's much more healthier.
Socker dricka best drink ever and less sugar
Diet Cokes company be like free advertisement! It’s gone now we got to actually do what he’s been asking us to do for a long time and sponsor his video
😔🔫
Pepsi: THIS IS OUR OPENING
I am STUNNED by this result
woo. Kroger! Cinnci for the win!
Diet soda is worse for you than regular soda. In my opinion, the best soda is the one made with real sugar
WAIT A SECOND, DR. PEPPER'S NOT COLA!?!
As a diabetic I was excited to see what you think was the best. However as a Californian I am disappointed that my area doesn't have any of these stores mentioned at the end. There is a food co but it's about 12 miles from home. So maybe one day I'd try it if I ever happen to be in that area. Loved the vid.  I love seeing more sugar free or low calorie food inclusion on this channel!
Okay hear me out Diet Pepsi is some serious Gourmet soda
Here in west England, we don't say pop, cola, soda or coke when refering to carbonated drinks, we just desribe them as they are "fizzy Drinks" is how we say it
G Fuel Energy Formula, and it has caffiene.  and not the one made by Gatorade.   Have a tournament entirely of store brand diet sodas?   And a deep dive into Private Labels would be amazing!
What are you using to clense your pallet?
“What kind of other do you want”  “Diet Pepsi”
This makes me wonder what is the healthiest/best sweetener. I think it would be an interesting topic to see covered.
You know they are meant for each other when they do the exact thing in Rock Paper Scissors
I prefer root beer
Good old rock! Nothing beats rock!
The intro was so aggressive that the video was inmediatly engaging.
Is 8:10 and 13:21 a camera glitch?
B
Thankfully you only picked one, you wouldn't want any diversity in what you drink, one drink is good enough for ever.
Give him a day, he'll be back on the sweet, savory taste of the nice and refreshing ice-cold diet coke
Stevia is a natural plant sugar that even diabetics can have. So if this drink has stevia as a sweetener rather than sugar or artificial sweeteners, then even people who have diabetes can have it.
glich 13:29
oh wow
Food lion is not only in North Carolina
This is so pure, I think Steph has a very beautiful sports commentator's voice
The universe knew what your favorite would be!
so are we gonna ignore the glitch around 8:10?👀
Mat's wife: *surprised pikachu face* 20:53
In Ireland we say fizzys or just brand name
NC gang
He's had enough of blatantly advising and not getting sponsored.
MatPat: *Chooses Harris Teeter instead of Diet Coke for the winner* Me: Top 10 Anime Betrayals
Steph picked Coke Zero? I knew she had the best taste...
is this a dream?
I say soda for sure
North Carolina is doing well, I'm proud of Food Lion as well, I shop there all the time and it's probably a favorite of mine, aside from Kroger and Harris Teeter is a close 3rd.
imagine wanting a diet soda with a sweetener that can cause dementia   this post was made by glass bottle Rootbeer gang
Food Lions are VEEEERY popular in Maryland. They’re like everywhere
Just focus on the die in Diet Coke
Bro I think cheerywine has a Diet Coke but I’m not sure if it is flavored or not sorry
???... now everytime something weird happens especially on the GT channels... my head goes straight to some sort of secret 😅.  Technical glitch right? 13:30 22:52
Food lion is from a dutch company btw. Don't act like North Carolina are slick
I've got both a Kroger and a Harris Teeter within 3 miles of my house, so I got you, fam. For science!
In Canada we call it pop or at least I do
M y S o u l
Ralph's groceries and their sodas I have that fruity aftertaste on the colas both diet and they are my soda of choice out here in CA
If sodas are the food theory, could we see a possible related game theory also can based... maybe onlycans with its body horror and corporate espionage?
I don’t drink a lot of soda and I’m planning on going out and finding that brand. With all the business you are probably sending them I wonder if they would sponsor you? 🤔
Anyone else see the 4 green glitch lines at 4:06?
MatPat just confirming what Good Mythical Morning's been saying: Kroger Brand is best brand.
Soda
I can't even drink coke, but the good news is that because I don't drink coke, no cavities.
D: fizzy drinks
Zevia
In Canada and most ppl I interact with say "pop"
hey matt sams the grocery stores blue mtn dew you might wanna give it a try
What about Pepsi?
I grew up calling it pop, but I think I've switched to only calling canned or bottled products pop because of the noise when you open them while fountain beverages or anything assembled immediately prior to consumption can claim the name soda.
It's pop, anything else is wrong.
MatPat: It's my dream episode! Me: EpiSODA
coming from nc i have to say that the stores diet cola is for some reason really dang good
In Australia we call them soft drinks.
Did they pour them all at the same time? Because I bet half of them were flat before they tasted them
This man better be hitting them crunches with all this food he eating
Soda is what I called it.
this isn't a theory anymore, it's just matpat mukbang
Coke✅
I had a mix of soda, pop, and soda pop
NORTH CAROLINA GANG
I have a question for this theory. What do you replace your Diet Coke addiction with? You can only drink so much water and what else besides sweeten teas give you the sweet taste that soda does.
You dtink what suits you. Theres is no best, different flavors but no best. Its all subjective.
Nooooooooòoooooooooooooòoooooooo
Years ago i came up with a food theory about diet coke myself - everyone who i saw drink it regularly seemed overly confident and enthusiastic in what they do. Mat  Pat was one of them, but also my favourite high school teachers, my aunty and one of my uncles. Which seemed weird, because diet coke is definitely an acquired taste. One of my new housemates noticed the same thing.  As a joke I started to drink diet coke more often when I was asked if i wanted soft drink, "so some of that confidence could rub off on myself". Then I started drinking it after running in the morning everyday, and now that's transformed to having it for breakfast regardless if I run before then or not. Now I'm pretty much drinking it unironically and actually like it. I had some while watching this video (over breakfast).  Has anyone else noticed the same thing about people who drink diet coke? Would love to see a food theory episode on it :P
I call it soda.
The lesson: Citric acid is the magical liquid
the impossible just happened
Harris Teeter only recently acquired a store in NYC. Murray's Cheese in Greenwich.
Matpat: *kicks out the dr peppers and rootbeers*  Me: and I took that personally
Welp! There was a time when people add lemon to the coke
DONT REPLACE DIET COKE ITS UR DRINK
this might as well be a "Goodbye Youtube" video
I would love to see more diet cola brackets each March to see if there are any new champions or if the Harris Teeter formula really is Mat's true new fav.
Who are you and what have you done to matpat?!
huh, I'm not crazy about diet sodas, I just can't drink anything else (type 1 diabetic) but something I've noticed is the diet sodas fizz when you pour and normal sodas fizz when you drink them.
My faverit diet soda (is Pepsi max it’s also The most popular soda in my home country aka danmark)
I got a coke ad before this kek
Come to the UK and try Pepsi Max
Might as well been sponsored by Harris Teeter

People swapping diet cola for something else? Me and my homies drink water and milk
What is with the green flickers? Also I'm from Ga my family calls it all soda.
As an avid Diet Mountain Dew drinker, I love this episode and I hope one day you’ll do maybe an episode of alllll big name diet sodas head to head? Either way I love this channel and look forward to more!

Tastiest Diet Soda is an oxymoron. I've heard that they are less healthy than the regular sodas. If you're having a soda, drink something good.
I hope my own state Alabama win March madness this year
I got a smiths by my house
No exaggeration Aspertame is literally the devil. The sugar it's replacing is far less unhealthy than it.
where I grew up they were called minerals but have called them soda for the past 10 years
Zevia cola was far better when it was sweetened with stevia+erythritol. I find it almost too sweet now. Before, it was more like Diet Pepsi.  Edit:  Hey, guys! I went out and bought a store-brand cola (Kroger’s Big K diet cola) to do a taste test. It’s really good and is now my official favorite diet cola.
Blink twice in your next video if you are not safe
Well matpat finally quit his Coke addiction im so proud
for some reason, I thought you guys lived in California
Soda
Initial reaction to video: “WOAH WHAT?!” Ending reaction after video: “WOAH WHAT?!”
matt loves diet coke and i love dr pepper
How about just don't drink soda? Why is that so hard? Just don't drink it, it's horrible for your body! You people disappoint me.
I believe in Diet Coke supremacy.
pop and soda
Who would win? Matpat's long- time favorite Some lemon
Bruh I only have food lion near me. I gotta say, the dr perky may have a weird name, but its pretty good.
Initial reaction to video: “WOAH WHAT?!” Ending reaction after video: “WOAH WHAT?!”
Jesus Christ the world is gonna end. Matpat quit Diet Coke!
... *blinks at screen title.* .... INCONCEIVABLE!   This is so crazy it took me back to a _Princess Brice_ reference!
Lol this is like living years beside a treasure trove and not noticing it.
Did he move I thought he lived in california?
Who saw the glitch at 4:05
Who is he and what is he done to Mat Pat
4:05 is it just my pc being broken or are there horizontal green lines for a single frame?
Monkey see monkey do
when the screen flickers and you dont know if its only an error or a fnaf easter egg anymore 13:30
The way they process stevia actually ruins its health benefits. Unless it's actually 100% pure unprocessed stevia it's unfortunately not good for you anyway. "/
So, the thing that sets Shasta apart is literally just how many non-caffeinated flavors they have. Generally speaking anything that there is a conterpart for is better, but at least in the northwest no one else has anywhere near as many flavors available. It's also better than other things in it's price bracket. Generally speaking a pretty good deal, great for parties.
I drink shasta cola more than coca-cola
I'm soda
15:31 Im refriegerante, Cuz i live im brazil.
Ive massively cut back on soda consumption in general.  NGL, when I was in 11th and 12 grade my I would go through a 12 pack of coke a cola in like 2-3 days....it was bad lol.  But Coke is so good.
I'm soda pop
Seeing the thumbnail: matpat saying that he wanted to be sponsored by coke... interesting...
You shouldn’t be looking at Diet in general.  But looks fun from the first 4mins
Your wife is so in love with you - they way she looks at you! Don't screw it up! The girl always picks the guy!
you forgot water.. best diet drink
That moment when you realize you live in the same state as your favorite YouTuber
Maybe don't replace a diet cola with another diet cola?
A fun fact I work at a Fred Meyer‘s in Alaska. It’s pretty nice
I’d love a food theory of bobs burgers maybe if the metsiagh is even posible
Whats up with all the colors that happened in a slit second at 13:30
Soda
Hi, texas here. We say Coke
Diet coke does come in glass bottles
Green Cola is my personal preference. Though important note: cool it before consumption. Plain Green Cola has an after taste, which goes away when cold for whatever reason. This actually works to the flavored versions benefit, but that's not what we're interested in here.
Food lion is not that uncommon of a school there is two food lions within a ten mile radius of my house
Did Anyone Notice The Corruption At 13:30
I basically only drink uk own brand cola so I can sort of relate to this
Are you actually gonna give a diet Coke?
Has anyone noticed the video glitches
well i have no harris teeter, so im sticking with diet coke
New name for the channel: face cam theory
As someone who also lives in North Carolina (Cary to be precise) I can %100 support the findings of this video, and I don't even drink soda anymore. HT diet cola is just on a whole different level

my dude i wanted to buy the whole diet coke company just to sponser u
I live in Georgia. The home of Coca-Colaand everyone says soda
I’ve lived in NC for most of my life and when my friend who moved from Ohio brings up soda and calls it pop, I’m like “what??” And in a country accent I say “idk what this pop nonsense is but in these here parts we call it soda”

The Harris Teeter soda reminds me of that one picture about a young American in the Olympics who woke up late, said "f**k" on TV, and won the gold metal...
just drink monster
just wondering if there is the same soda that won in canada and if so where can i find it?
Diet Dr. Pepper is better than Diet Coke..... Fight Me!
the undoable has been done
Great vid, but the random green flashes kinda ruined it a bit
Now we'll be seeing the Harris Teeter soda in a lot of future videos
I call it soda mostly but sometimes I interchange it with pop
c
Soda. but I'm from Ohio. Not sure what your damage is. :]
Food Theory topic, Is diet soda ACTUALLY worse for you than regular soda?
That "Imaginary Plastic" taste isn't Imaginary. I can taste it the most in Coke's brand of water, Dasani. I can't drink it as it just tastes like liquid polymer to me.   PepsiCo's plastic bottles does not have that Polymer taste, or at least not as much.
I'm a soda guy
yooooo since when do you live in NC its my home state
Not surprised. Back in my pub days, the most popular drinks I sold, were the lightest and easiest to drink. Most paletes don't like strong flavors. I guess you can't account for tast.
B:soda
Sucralose is just beer sugar
Fun Fact: MatPat didn't get that fresh cut
Hey did anyone notice the very noticeable glitches, I think it’s a message so go get working dedicated fans! I think it’s related with the crow64 codes

He forgot glass bottles of diet coke
im absolutely a dr pepper guy, though i usually just drink water... that being said, bootleg store brand colas can be really good. ive had some really nice ones. i havent had any in ages, and i dont think they were diet, but yeah theres some great bootleg ones out there
Did Mat and Steph ever say why they moved to NC? Honestly I forgot they moved until this episode.
Publix be lit bois
Putting the ingredient list would help folks double check those other stores ;)
I quit Coke after they started being racist.     No Conke, only Bepis.
im mainy a coke but whenever im unsure of what they specifically have ill say soda
First theory video I've watched in a while since diet coke is so iconic to MatPat..
I’m a, what soda do you want
Diet soda gives me hiccups, figure that one out
Diet RC?
D: I'm from the uk, to me it is a fizzy drink
It’s all coke ! I’m insulted by the term pop
I can’t believe I just watched two adults tasting cola.
*clicks video to scold mat pat about not having enough avatar content * checks title * NO WAY !
Harris teeter is also in Maryland not just the carolinas edit: also food lion mat bruh
If Mat Pat really quits diet coke, I unsubscribe.
Here in Wisconsin we have Pick-n-save (which has Kroger products) and honestly, I always prefer their foods over places such as Walmart or Festival foods. Kind of happy that Kroger got some notoriety. It's a great company.
B, soda, in England.
Top 10 anime betrayals in history??
No
11:50 That can artwork! XD
What's with the green bars?
Just move on to diet Dr pepper, my guy. 😋
I wanna see you guys try moxie
Diet Coke really should've paid Mat to advertise. Sorry coke, you stink for not helping out my favorite youtuber with money!!!!
In Hong Kong we used to just say soft drink 😂
I say “pop”
I grew up in Indiana saying pop, but I moved to Alabama and got yelled at by my band for refusing to say soda or coke. When I will never understand why you would say coke when not only specifying coke products,like a lady asked what kind of coke do you want and so my brother said vanilla but she was asking about pop but they weren’t even coke products
Soda in L.A
The Aldi diet cola that we get in Aus  is really good!   Also does the USA not have Pepsi Max?  Is that what Pepsi zero is?   So odd
I am watching this as someone who has never enjoyed ANY kind of diet cola. But, whatever, it was entertaining.
Me: *laughs in Coke Icee*
food
Dude, Harris Teeter is awesome. They have this crazy Victorian Lemonade that is just... splendid. And I can't find it anywhere here in AZ.
Cheerwine, although it breaks the non-cola rule, is my favorite. And it can almost exclusively sold in NC.
is coke zero and diet coke somewut the same? or.....
Meanwhile i can't tell the difference between coke and pepsi
b = I don't know y I live in Minnesota always have. I call it soda for some reason
Lol I just realized something    “Wait... some ppl have never seen a Harris Teeter before? Or a Food Loin?”   But seriously though, before watching this vid I thought those where everywhere XD
I'm a cocaine guy
13:30 does anyone else that glitch as he says "but"? Does this deserve a theory about the theory man, or is it just a glitch?
A:pop
The crabby patty secret formula is sitric acid.
I feel like Matt and the rest of the theme have invested more money in the last 2 videos than in the whole history of the channel
13:30-13:40 the camera goes all weird and messes up
I'm up in indy, and we have a kroger right up the road from us. I hate diet soda with a passion, cause it has such an off-putting taste (it's the artificial sweetener. It's always the sweetener) but I'll get some tomorrow and try it.
Welp, me being from Canada am out of luck.  That said, my Red River Coop soda is tasty, and uses can sugar which is nice as well.
I guess we know why 2020 sucked so much. Matt stopped drinking diet coke and balance was destroyed.
Fun fact: in Honduras we say chasta(which we took from the drink shasta) refering to something that is of bad quality or second grade, tho the slang is almost not used as before, and the drink is not sold here anymore.
ok, at 3:04, 8:08, and 13:31, you can see flashes of lines on the screen, which seems a little fishy(but it might just an editing mistake?). also, in the description, it says "Who will win this MArch MAdness soda bracket? WAtch to find out!", which is weird because the second letters of march,, madness, and watch are capitalized. just something to note!
You quit diet coke?!! Are you forced to do this are you okay???
D, Other: COLA! Pepsi COLA. Coca COLA. Shasta COLA. COME ON GUYS!!!
Qfc big k gang
12:21 HE SAID BIZARRE! IT WAS A JOJO REFRENCE
*reads title*  Well the world must be coming to an end
C. Soda
Wait wont one of you telling the other about the drink you just had before they do bias them? I don't think this is real science.
Matt, don’t drink diet stuff; to replace all the sugar, they’ve got tons of horrid chemicals... even more than usual, I mean.
Comment or like if you were here sense day one
I'm a DP guy but can you do a video on the Yoohoo, been here for 103 years, and what makes chocolate water so good in it?
I've been to food lion in Virginia, I dont think it's just North Carolina?
“Food lion, you probably never heard of it.”  Bro, that’s the only store I shop at.
I gotta show this to my mom!!!
The CEO of Coke has sent you a message, would you like to accept?  "PLEEEEEEEASE DON'T LEAVE US!"
no the meme is dead
literally a gmm episode.
I'm B: soda
Other:this is my answer ... that's it folks
Dr. Thunder (a store brand version of Dr. Pepper) is surprisingly good, only tried it cause our Walmart wasn't carrying 24 packs of Dr. Pepper and we were trying to be a little more cost efficient...

The grocery store using the same factories would be a great theory. Kinda like how Kirkland brand has been..rumored...to share factories...gray goose and Kirkland..can't confirm or deny..but...it would be interesting :3
B
All diet soda are a nock off of diet RC Cola
Somethings wrong I can feel it
My dad said "pop" until I was a bit older, mom said "soda". I said "soda pop" until in preschool I got sick of having people say "a what?" so I just went with "soda". And Steph this was in the south. In Dixie in fact. Dad was from up north he switched to "soda" after i switched to saying it too.
Yo, is it just me, or is this episode riddled with possibly not so random coloring glitches? is this some sort of ARG thing or is it just uploaded buggy?
Pepsi Max ftw it's simple
14:39 We’ve heard of it! Mr Beast bought everything in a Food Lion for charity once.
First PEWDIEPIE says he quits Minecraft now this wow the world is bizarre   Matpat persuaded me to drink Diet Coke and it is great   but this is just bad
Do a part two with other flavors of soda please
Soda obviously who calls it pop
This ... was so wholesome ....!  MUCH love to you both! <3
3 hours ago
We at food theorists do not support mass consumption of Diet Coke despite Matt’s ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis
Impossible
Anyone else see the glitch’s in the video?
Im a midwest boy too and I call it pop
"unless we got crystal pepsi back in the 80s..."  crystal pepsi is still sold in canada

You two are perfect for each other you both use big words that I don’t understand
I’m a pop guy
Didn’t he drink some Diet Coke  during the Hot ones episode
FIZZY DRINKS
THERE'S A CODE IN THE VIDEO!!!
They were suppose to do these tests separately. Since they are together, their answers wont exactly line up with how they would be alone. This is psychology 101. One person could be emulating the others opinion subconsciously. Steph definitely seems like a "yes" person to me; will agree with whatever Matt (the star of the show) says more often than if she was alone with her own opinions. Not having the chance to be scrutinized by her peers.
Up in the northern mountain region, It's always been called Soda whenever anyone says it.
do you have diabetes cause I’m worried for you
Please reply to this comment what went through your head when you saw this title
Pop pop in Canada
Do a part two with a Dr Pepper root beer flavors of Coke and other sodas 🥤
Dukeeeee!!!!
Food lion, publix, and harris teeter are like. The main grocery stores for me. Yes. Im also in north carolina.
ITs Soda pop coke duh
I typically prefer fountain soda unless it's Baja Blast which is typically fountain exclusive but it's one of those, if you get the mix wrong, it ruins the whole thing so when it's available in the cans & bottles, I'll typically buy a few bottles of it because I go for plasticy over tinny any day. I'm a regular Coke drinker for the most part & I like fountain Coke so much that I can identify which Coke comes from where like when I was a kid, Red Robin was one of my favorite restaurants for not only the decor but because their Coke was consistently good. They remodeled & Happy Panda because my favorite because good Coke & amazing sweet & sour sauce but that changed when they got new ownership, pretty much any restaurant I enjoy gets ruined at some point lol. McDonald's Coke is an easy one to tell apart from the others because it kind of tastes just a tad watered down but that actually works for it in my opinion because on the occasion where they can make that cola flavor stand out more, it's fantastic. I found a McDonald's where I recently moved to that has had better Coke than usual so that makes me happy. On the flip side, the one closer to the house I'm moving into once it's finished, ugh, that one has some of the worst Coke.  Thanks for the tip, I live in the Great Pacific Northwest, recently moved from Oregon to Washington & thank goodness there's still Fred Meyer stores to where I moved to, just less than where I use to live. I'll have to swing by there & pick up some of their in store brand soda. I just don't drink diet so I think I'll go for the regular which like, I think I had as a kid because Fred Meyer use to have a soda machine with a off brand soda, I could never remember what brand it was but it was in the in between area of the entrance & it was like 75 cents a bottle I think so as a kid going there & my dad being cheap & not buying any Coke, I'd make sure to bring a dollar with me & getting a soda from the machine when I went. It wasn't Coke but it was still good.  Where I grew up, not sure about where I live now, there was a mix of ways to say soda. Soda was probably the most common people would say but I heard pop every once in a while & my dad says cola. I grew the habit of saying cola due to him but never when I order because you go to a Pepsi restaurant & you want to order a drink with a self serve fountain so you ask for the generic soda cup, you ask for a medium cola, 9 times out of 10 the worker will say, "we have Pepsi here." They think you mean Coca-Cola because Pepsi Cola isn't as commonly said I suppose? I try telling my dad to not say cola, especially that it doesn't count for all sodas but he still says cola. I hate that I picked that up from him. It's like "dad, you want a diet orange Sunkist, that's not a cola." He'd argue that all sodas are cola. Maybe it's a central/eastern Washington thing since that's where he grew up? I don't know. I prefer saying soda myself because everyone gets what you mean. Oh, I know people who would get on your case if you said "soda pop" so I guess it's best to not say that if you're ever in Portland Oregon.
Pop is growing up in Iowa and Nebraska, but here in Arizona, they call it Soda
Plot twist: The MatPat in this video is not our MatPat, but is his alternate counterpart from a parallel universe.
In Louisiana we call it soda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCOsJPxE-QI
Not a single store on the list of owned by Kroger is near me, the closest Kroger is several hours away.....
I'm a pop person but soda is starting to catch on.

At 13:30 thare is some thing?
Matpat. Pepsi. Zero. Sugar.  Enough said.
Diet coke is the new wine
Soda pop
no diet coke for 2020 bet matpat was SOOOOOO sad  all of 2020 no offence
Living in NC I was surprised to find out y’all lived here.
I drank zevea before and it is bad
Haha Boylands makes the best root beer ever but I never had the diet cola. Now I know not to get it lol
I love episodes like this and the spice one
what about coke energy(just found out it’s a real thing)
Is it just me or does NOONE in the south say what kinda COKE do you want because everyone says soda. Usually when someone says what kinda coke you want it means do you coca___
There's no way
So is MatPat now a....    Soda Drinker Pro?
Matt.....are you ok?
We are proud of you mat
citric acid is the secret ingredient in everything if we just use citric acid we can solve the fnaf lore
In the US Northeast, its just "soda"
A truly sad day
I love that MatPat is more serious about Diet soda than politicians are about politics. Also. B/C equally
Watch Diet Coke try to sponsor him right after he quits
Can confirm from Ohio Kroger's diet Cola, every once in a blue moon a batch of their pop will have an extra orangey flavor to it. It's been my parents favorite cola for what feels like the last two decades and they hate it when they get a carton with this weird mix.
I agree don't this store brand soda especially Sam cola
B: soda
Plot twist: Matthew has been payed for drinking all sodas and the one he likes he's going to be sponsored.
mat pat quits diet coke guess the world is really ending
Pepsi is the best
You should try some of them cold, Some drinks taste better cold.
I call it answer D: other. I call it "frisdrank". Maybe that's because I'm Dutch, so... Yes... Okay... I'll seat myself out
Joke?
I'm SHOOK.
MatPat has been curded of his Diet Coke addiction for a supermarket brand of duet soda
This is the only March Madness I care about
Thank you theorists, for helping me shout it from the rooftops. Stevia is f'in gross!
*is revealed that it's Kroger's soda*  That makes sense.....Kroger soda rocks
Mat: *quits diet coke for 2020/a year*  Also Mat: *goes back to it in 2021*  Diet Coke: "You could not live with your own failure, where did that bring you? Back to me."
I drink as much as diet coke as Matty Patty. My co-worker didn't believe me when there's a difference between Pepsi and Coke lol
I can not believe the best Cola lived right next to them
Okay but... cola from a glass bottle
Coke
I'm coke lol "what coke you want?" To include powder.
Water hehehehe :"3
zero coke tates about cardboard in a good way
07:00 I can't begin to explain how confusing it was that you put the diet coke left and the other brand right, when diet coke was number 2. You'd expect them to be put where the cups would be but nope, it was just random. Thanks editor!
Guess it’s the asprotame
Coke
B
Just drink regular coke
I love the fact that I have a food lion in my neighborhood
Coke Zero
C all the way!
Coke Zero
Born and raised in the south and I've always said soda.  Also, Stephanie's facial expression at the end was priceless
What about rc  cola!  I mean I have seen it everywhere I have went and I'm a trucker.
To make this more scientific they really should've had a third person prepare the drinks and not tell them what the condenders are. Otherwise every round is just trying to guess between 2 brands that you k now, with all the preconceived notions you have coming along with it.
I’m from Iowa, and it’s pop
I clicked the moment I saw the title after being shock for 3 seconds. The twist Matpat tries every kind of Diet Coke he can find in this one
_i proudly call all sodas “coke”_
This is funny because I was going for Harris Teeter from the beginning and it one!
New theory: citric acid is the krabby patty secret ingredient
fun fact your body coverts non calorie sodas to calories
Harris Teeter sales spike by 10000%
So is there a PO Box or a way we theorists can send the ingredients of our Kroger branded diet soda’s so we can see if they all are the same?
Lmao quitting Diet Coke for my B-day XD!!!!
Kroger's Private Select chocolate ice cream is the best chocolate ice cream to me. Makes sense that their diet soda would be good too
who is he, and where has he been hiding his clones
dont hmu. only real ones know whats up.   lol
B: Soda. I'm from Texas, and while to SOME degree it's true that 'Coke' can refer to any soda/pop in the South, I'm under the impression that's becoming outdated, if it's not already. Anytime I have ordered a Coke anywhere within the last ten years or so, I have not then been asked "what kind?" and I just get a Coke. To my experience, it is understood that a Coke is a Coke and not any other soda/pop. I'm not completely if it's just the area I'm in, my age group, or the blanket term no longer being a blanket term, but I'm willing to bet it's the latter.
Coke Zero is teh best
to be fair diet pepsi is just gross
coke ofcourse mostly cuz we dont have pop and soda we dont say soda here in the netherlands so i say soda is like pepsi or something and thats just so much sweeter than coke what i rly dont like
coke’s sales after this 📉📉📉
The 2 closest grocery stores to me is Food Lion and Harris Teeter lol
I absolutely love that Stephanie is more and more part of the videos
Pop
9:35 meme faces
Diet Coke: and I took this personally..
15:28   B. Soda
in UK pepsi no sugar is called pepsi max
*reads title          *chokes on diet coke.
Not to sound preachy or something but you can actually reduce your soda cravings a whole lot if you only drink water for a few weeks.
"from a store you've probably never even heard of, Food Lion" dude, they're everywhere down here. XD Plus, I'm currently at one, so, would be weird if I didn't know they existed till now. XD  But, as for the drink name; I move back and forth between B & C; so, I'll call it soda or coke.
B: Soda
MatPat, I've always respected how your titles were set up, but I can't honestly endorse you anymore due to the abhorrid lie you have said in this title, while you might've made it through 2020, I can't believe how off brand you are acting (just messing with you, I love your content bro have a nice day)
I can feel it, Cokea cola will go out of business in the next few hours
this has officially become their shitpost acc
Not diet coke
LET'S GO TEETER YEAHHH!!
11:45 Shasta is my favorite cola for it's sweetness. THAT SAID I DON'T DRINK IT DIET so perhaps it fails HARD there?  Oh and BTW Pepsi is my SECOND favorite with coke at 4th below the 3rd place store.  THAT SAID MY GO TO IS CHERRY PEPSI.  Not only that but even when the cherry version isn't available I'm still likely to go Pepsi over Shasta's sweet taste...BECAUSE IRONICALLY THE 6 PACKS OF THE BOTTLES AREN'T AVAILABLE HERE for Shasta. And cans are missing too...THEY ONLY HAVE BIG BOTTLES! Whoops...
I think the original Coca-Cola recipe is the best
Nice Episode Guys!
A. POP!!
MatPat, I am alittle ashamed, but I feel you bro. 😢
Diet Coke: How on Earth did our sales drop 77% in one day??
I like Pepsi instead of coke but hey it’s still good
Who are you and what have you done with MatPat?

I love how you are always so funny right now I am sick but watching these vids makes me feel better thank you mat pat for being my fav YouTube since 2015.
I choose you RC cola
I'm sensing a theory video with citric acid in the near future
Is the episode glitchy for anyone else?
soda
I like these types of videos
My mom would always call regular soda bubbly so that I wouldn't know she was drinking champagne :)
I call option E, all of the above, I switch it from calling it pop and soda and cola and other stuff, can someone relate because I feel off qwq
I don't like diet soda
WTH Matt Pat is giving up the D coke
Did you know that Pepsi-Cola originated in New Bern, NC? So technically North Carolina beat North Carolina. Also, as a fellow non-native North Carolinian, I call it soda.
Pepsi zero is known as Pepsi Max here in the UK
Early
Coke because it's the south. In the South; your drinks are coke, sweet tea, and lemonade. Of course, there's ya booze but there are laws around that and not just being 21. Dry counties are still a thing.
MatPat : "I QUIT Diet Coke!"  These are confusing times.
Nice Episode Guys!
Us nebraskans are soda people
23:13   Me watching from South Africa: Mhmm...None of these stores are relevant to me😐😶
Me: * starts searching for Harris Teeter stocks *
I'm from West Virginia and I know food lion is
diet pepsi is the best over every soda.

This is more worse the seedeng Quitting YouTube
Soda! Also yeah stevia is absolutely disgusting.

Nooooo! My poor Dr. Pepper!!! I must have my revenge!
I dont know if yall did this but you should have rinsed off your mouths with water every time you switched drinks.
If you don't call it soda then you aren't talking about the same thing as the rest of people with brains i'm sorry
diet soda is the saving grace of being on a diet lol.
You don't pick your favourite soda. Your favourite soda picks you.
Any Dr. Pepper fans here?
im B
this is even sadder news than Steph leaving Gt live
why not pepsi

Hey mat, I think it’s not being made right now because of COVID, but when it’s over I recommend diet Sierra mist

the real question, how much green poop?
I only drink guarana
Click baitin-ist title ever for anyone who's been here since Chronotrigger... Clap-and-a-half.
Diet Pepsi
NoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo
Watching the theory channels makes me notice all sort of little things and rn I'm wondering about the screen flickers that happen throughout the video and if there's some sort of hidden theory game happening again or if it's just an aesthetic choice....
In the north east, most people call it Soda, but my grandparents and other older people usually call it Tonic, if that's a little unique
I know one store brand soda I was really surprised was pretty good was Casey's (a convenience store/gas station that also sells pizza for those who don't have one locally) root beer. I'm not entirely sure, but it might also be because I'm used to just getting store brand sodas though.
Aspartame is the devil lol
Weak I drink 20 cans a day
Hi
Peach Nehi
I was shocked to hear food lion was North Carolina based because I’ve been to it quite a few times in the north east
Coke zero is my go to. I like it better than the non-diet stuff
Cherry Pepsi all the way!
Time to set out to Mariano's.
Surprised TAB didn't make it into the video.  It has the largest and most rabid fan base out of all the diet colas.

Who are you, and what have you done with MatPat?!

Fun fact: Food Lion is the American branch of the Belgian groceries store chain Delhaize, which is very well known here!
This is before the final one I’m voting for Harris Teeter! Edit:YES!!!!
never clicked on a theorist video faster. so much lore in this
Soda
I thought this was going to be helping stopping your sub-addiction, but I’m fine with this!
I call is Soda Pop just to annoy American's, eh.
Am I the only one who saw glitches in this video. I know I saw at least two.
You should do this again, but with all sodas
B
I’m writing this as I’m ending the episode I’m at the 3 way and I’m scared. You got me into a crippling addiction of Diet Coke and I don’t know what’s going to happen. Am I going to have to change my drinks? Will my world explode? Will the next Fnaf video cameo Scott cawthon?!?!? Jkjk. Anyway thanks for the videos keep it up!!!
I grew up saying soda, but I've ironically started saying "sody-pop" and can't stop. We usually only get coke zero cus it's on sale so I just say coke most of the time.  Edit: I'm a northwest raised boi btw.
Tbh I like Diet Coke and Coke Zero as my main sodas
Why does Mat laugh whenever he's suffering from taste or smell.
its ALWAYS pop, soda is only reserved for craft sodas, if its product line, its pop
What about fountain drinks from McDonald's it's going to be a lot better from a different restaurant that uses worse packaging
I like Pepsi lol
Harris Teeter to Coca-Cola: *Middle finger*
Coke Zero for sure
I call it soft drink in Australia and fizzy in the uk.
shout out to the northcalinens who didnt realized food lion was only in NC.
I like Inca Cola
Coke with actual Cocaine.
S P I R I T
we here in poland call it kola
I like Pepsi max more than diet coke
The meme's are going to be really hard to make now seeing as its a random drink. lol. So Kroger may be giving the same Soda in Safeway, one of the chains we have here as most of what they get is I think under that kroger branding.
my fav diet coke is Freeway Cola Zero, which is a store brand (Lidl)
I'ma pop guy
Pop gang
I think you should try Sprite
Funny about citric acid since I choose diet coke w/ 🍋 lemon iced tea if I don't get Coca Cola w/ watermelon 🍉 added at Sonic  Highly recommend but haven't had soda in years so it'll probably burn my tongue either way
personally i think that you should choose water as your new cola replacement
I’m from central indiana and we use “coke.” But in “the region,” close to Chicago they use “pop.” “Soda” is an eastern thing.
my favorite part about the animations of them is there eyes there just really funny and not straight
Of course the video that he does for food Theory that's 30 minutes long is about Coca-Cola LOL Diet Coke to be precise LOL
Hello internet welcome to Food Theory, today were gonna drink so much diet soda were gonna get cancer B)
I'm in texas and we say soda
Midwest but I am still soda
Wait food-lion isn’t anywhere else oh I had no clue
We have food lion in Tennessee and Georgia
You know that had to be the most uninteresting flamethrower I've ever seen. One might even say it was genuinely Boring. :P
I see

When I saw the title of this video I was like... I MUST BE ON A DIFFERENT TIMELINE
Will simply put it most craft soda brands fail miserably at diet drinks

1:00 wait I know this one - it's that MatPat made the Mario is a psychopath theory... wait that's not it? 😥

Grew up in southwest Missouri. There is no standard here. Pretty unique area that's made up by people from all over. As a child, I said, "pop," but ended up unconsciously switching to calling it "soda" in high school.
Praise God 🙏🏾
Admit it guys: we cried watching this
I would not be surprised if the soda fountain they got it from is actually in his house.
You could improve this test by also testing the three finalists after a day in the fridge, and an hour in room temperature (to test the flat versions of the three). Also, testing the three finalists a day after could make the test more objective.
RED ALERT! RED ALERT! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! I REPEATED, THIS IS NOT A DRILL!  DIET COKE IS NO LONGER MATPAT'S FAVOURITE SODA! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!
Soda
Harris teeter and piggly wiggly for the south 😎😎
Hope your safe during the tornado
I'm from Detroit and we call it pop. Shout out to the Midwest!!!
Pop
Steph if you don’t like stevia, but want to use a different healthier, natural sweetener I recommend xylitol. It has a good taste and I heard it good for your teeth or something.
Im D We call it NOSHABEH :D
You should try some Earp’s Sarsaparilla. It’s really good
It’s pop all the way
I quit soda entirely about 2 years ago. After quitting I feel more energetic and more healthy overall.
I'm sad that RC didn't make it
I call soda fizz
diet soda is not good for u it can be more bad for u than basic soda
Just wait till mat tries Beverly...
Texas, Coke universally.
it.. it cant be!
I love in the UK!!!!
Outrageous!! unsubbed.     jk obviously
Pop. Got looked at funny first time in florida when I said what pop you have at a restaurant. The lady didn't know what I was talking about.
Stevia is pretty gross, monk fruit is way better. It's hard to find a monk fruit diet soda, though.
I’ve lived in NC my whole life and no one’s ever asked me what kind of coke I want, that’s so weird!
Y’all got very sensitive taste buds, I can hardly tell the difference between regular and diet Mtn Dew. I can’t tell the difference between Sprite and Seven Up or Mtn Dew and Mello Yello
Plot twist : it's a sponsor for Harris Teeter
I grew up saying soda but now i use them almost interchangeably
I stopped drinking soda over a year ago now and now only drink water, tea, and milk. I was an avid Diet Coke drinker for 20 years and i feel so much better!
There was an add that I saw that said “they say only nerds drink drink Diet Coke” I immediately thought are they talking about MatPat
Have you heard of water?
5:09 it’s likely just the water your tasting as the mix is the same but the water from different bottling locations makes the taste very, I can taste the difference between the stuff from my local supermarket and the stuff from discount shop the other real coke (normal coke none of that sugar free rubbish for me, I can’t stand the taste of saccharine) but sourced from different places so the water has different mineral content.
Wait, that's illegal!
D fizzy drink
3:45 did he just say what I thing he said
Matpat abouta say why diet coke is tied to WW1
I love calling my Mountain Dew “other”, after all its probably not edible enough to call soda or pop and it definitely is no cola.... lol
Try pibb
imagine being in a relationship with someone SO insync that you have 6 "rock paper scissors" ties
i didn’t know that i thought he had a therorist voice and i figured it out because i was surprised when i heard him use it as his every day voice. anyone else
Go North Carolina, I love Jordans team
I looked at this title and said “uh oh”
Im a C, coke
I live in Indiana and Pop and Soda are used interchangeably. I prefer saying soda but when I’m not thinking about it I typically say pop.
I felt so irrelevant when Matt said nobody's heard of Food Lion 🙃 I shop at Food Lion like Walmart.
Sorry, Diet Pepsi.
How can you do this? Diet Coke is such a important part to your morals.
13:30 what is your problem man, my phone did this before and I had to buy a new one, nice going scaring me
Very suspicious of the glitch in the beginning
Nooooooo
In Australia we call it a soft drink
Knowing all the chains bc you were born in SC 💪
I saw the thumb nail and i was like dun dun dun
Idk if its me or my phone. But the camera looks brokenn with the green lines
Soda
What about soda without aspartame? A cola sweetened with erythritol or stevia? Like Zevia? Not in North Carolina?
I usually just say soda. My mom sometimes say soday pop because it's fun and I say it too sometimes.
haha he said zero then put zero from bordelands on the screen haha
Wow didnt know the logo for Stop and Shop is the same one for Giant
(Being.commented 29 secs into the vid) nuuuuuuu don't quite da coke
Love the show but I'm a dew fan
Soda
to be fair Matpat, that red jacket looks great on you.
Rhett and Link look different.
this is what happens when coke dosent sponsor matpat
It’s Coke. No matter what you say it’s coke
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ooo
I mean like I can taste the difference between fountain can and bottle
Me sipping Diet Coke now: interesting
Matt Pat: oh I hate this so much Also Matt Pat: goes back for another sip
Soda Pop
Clickbait haven’t even watched the video this isn’t Mat Pat
one thing  to bear in mind is that different artificial sweeteners  are tolerated by different people. hubby gets screaming migraines from Aspartame, but can eat Splenda...
you actually got me out here researching soft drinks
Matpat should try Irebur it is a scottish drink    Ps) it is better than diet coke like i can send him some
Someone: asks me how something tastes. Me: "it tastes."
Was this just an excuse for matpat to drink Diet Coke
Food lion and harris teeter are also in South Carolina.
Wait I don't understand why must you abandon the Nectar of the gods
Matt.... why the green camera edits buddy? are you hinting something?
We love our food lion down hear in Greenwood SC
Someone should make an anime out of This
Our family always said soda, but my grandpa would say pop
Even in your highlighted source it says they found aspartame to not be dangerous. It's one of the most studied food additives because people won't stop insisting it's bad no matter how many times they study it 🙄.
This is really fun for me to watch since I used to live in North Carolina. I LOVED going yo Food Lion since they had those kids carts there. 😅
Diet soda in general is garbage, no matter what. Just stick with the originals.
Steph looked especially gorgeous today 😍
I grew up calling it pop, but at some point started calling it soda.  ALSO...I love y'all, but I & many of my fellow college wrestling fans have been using the term #MarchMATness for years in reference to the college wrestling national tournaments. I did a Twitter search, and it looks like I first used it in 2013. I've already used it several times this month...including today.
How about Butterbeer from The Flying Cauldron? I have found it for sale at Giant Food, Harris Teeter (sometimes), Wegmans, and Books-A-Million.
Ah, yes, you finally got some rehab for your coke addiction
Boylan makes a good Root Beer.
Ok now i want to try it  We gotta find out who makes this wodnerful cola
Pepsi
My depression faded...       Now it's back...
Matpat... what have you done?
Top 10 anime betrayals
i'm the only 'soda' in my family of 'pop'
When I saw the title, I was like, the heck? is he serious?
I'm from NC and pepsi was made here, and i didn't know that food lion was only in NC.
Funny thing, in french Canada (province of Quebec) sodas are sometimes called "Liqueur" (yes, liquor) which makes no sense what so ever :p
I love march madness I’m voting for Michigan girls
In my humble opinion. La Croix lemon should be the only soft drink allowed
Soda is a drink. Pop is a genre of music and onomatopoeia.
Matpat: I’m going to stop drinking Diet Coke  Diet Coke: You can’t do that you need me because I am you and you are me we can’t live without each other you know this matpat come back
Since when did matpat quitting Diet Coke have to do with anything with game theories?
I suggest Grape flavored zevia, a lot of zevia flavors are kinda weird but grape is really solid Also I differ between soda and pop
Zero sugar coke > diet coke
HF might have won thanks to the element of surprise and freshness. We need a confirmation post if it can hold it's #1 position over a longer period like more than a week.
GMM did that with can, bottle, and fountain  Edit: They should do this
Does anyone else think that this is a video that good mythical morning would do?
drink raw milk
Here in Texas we call it Soda i
Matpat drinks a lot of Diet Coke I drink a lot of diet Fresca
Weird frame glitch, 13:30
Wait wait wait your telling me that mat pat lives in north Carolina tbh I thought he lived in California like a lot of youtubers
pop
Are the green video glitches some sort of code??
I call it soda-pop
Who else thought he was going to stop drinking diet coke instead of trying new flavours?
C: Coke fan for the win.
Lies
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 i'd never thought i'd see the day...
Diet drinks are way worse for you bro switch it up
Here in Australia, we call it fizzy. None of this soda, pop or what not
Citric acid is used on beers and meads to disguise impurities, which might be the same effect it has on the winner. You can simulate the taste by adding lime juice to your preferred diet cola though the proportion would require some experimenting. This is a Victory for science.
It’s a little weird to me because I use all the general terms interchangeably. My grandfather called it pop, my father calls it coke, my siblings and I call it soda, and all of it just stuck with me.
B
anyone know why the screen flashed green at 8:10? I might just be seeing things it might just be an editorial choice it might be the camera, but something isn't right...
15:28 Fizzy drink (I'm British lol)
My wife went to gradschool in NC - this is just your first door into the amazing world of harris tetter. The single greatest grocery store in the US.
thank GOD diet is so bad it just makes me burp all the time i take a sip!!!!!!!!!! :( btw i really like ur vids plz dont be mad at me
born and raised in Michigan, its Pop for me! (A)
Steph's southern accent coming out strong when talking coke over soda
Listen the only coke that I will drink (other than normal coke) is cherry coke and it is the best.
There is a Food lion I'm Florida and GA
I have a food scientist friend that had a rootbeer tasting bracket at a party with other food scientists, and he told me the winner was Big K brand Root Beer (Kroger's brand). It is good, but I haven't done similar "research" to confirm.
For me the order is 1 to 5 syrup ratio fountain drink Coke then Cain sugar glass bottle a.k.a. Mexican Coke than canned Coke then bottled Coke 20 ounces then 2 L next canned cane sugar Coke next Coke life then the stupid touchscreen Coke I can barely even drink usually I don’t drink it and avoid it I’m not sure the ratio but I feel like it’s 1 to 100 syrup ratio. They use these machines at Burger King and other cheap food locations. To save money. I would be happy to send you a Smith branded diet cola. From Utah. Also I feel like it was unfair for the fountain drink to be part of this since there was no other fountain drink competitors. For example diet Pepsi fountain. Oh although it be interesting to have more blind taste test from other individuals and it would be really cool to see the non-diet version of this. Unfortunately you wouldn’t be able to star in it unless you like regular cola LOL. Overall interesting idea but I would’ve like to see you discuss more of the variance of different fountain drink ratios out there.
Matpat as a hardcore theorist I have 2 main issues with your test.  Firstly are you drinking these taste tests back to back wouldn't one test mix with the next influencing the outcome.  Second wouldn't it be better doing your taste test separately if you taste something and then state how you feel about the drink then your significant other drinks it wouldnt they be influenced ever so slightly psychologically by the others opinion?  Love your videos matpat keep up the great work.
I love zevia; not everyone's cup of soda but I love it.
Growing up in the southwest (New Mexico) and living in Wisconsin now, I say soda
Soda
Wow, Giving up Diet Coke?! This MUST be serious!
I am soft drink
Theory: The Krabby Patty Secret ingredient is citric acid....
WTF

I live in Georgia, we call soft drinks, Cokes.

A:Soda, for me!
LIES
Your wife is hot. Is she single?
Big red
D: sprite
treason
Hello
Steph and I are on the same wavelength in regards to soda choice
Diet Dr. Pepper is where it is at.
LIES
This may seem like a little thing (maybe?) but I really appreciate that you used female athletes at 2:10 to show March Madness. MatPat and the Theory Crew--genuinely awesome people!!
If anyone sees a screen glitch it’s not a hidden clue it’s just a glitch I think
Me not being able to drink soda me relising I can drink diet soda Now I will join you  Me seeing this video aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Soda
The thing is though they drank all of them through what looks like plastic straws, and some drinks taste way better whether it be from a can or out of a glass jar
Water has left the chat
Australia we call em soft drinks
Did you know that in the UK we call soda "Fizzy Drinks" or " Fizzy Juice"
I’m a Florida man and we have plenty of the Publix soda.
Diet is bad and can cause cancer
Regular Sprite started using stevia as a sweetener without telling anybody at first and my wife hated it all of a sudden but didn't understand why. Edit: In my country.
I love dite rootbeer
I am Pop
They should try Happy Coke
IMPOSTER
the diet coke was flat so it did not taste as good
I’m from the south but raised by my mom who’s from California so I’m soda and coke. All colas are coke. Everything else is a soda.
Us Texans drink dr.pepper
I d go for gingerale but thats just me
Florida man here it's just soda 😂
B    We call it Soda in colorado.
Ok in gonna show my age here to anyone from Texas. But I remember Food Lion from my childhood back in the early 90s in the suburbs of Dallas TX. Probably mostly remember that store because they had sample kiosks EVERYWHERE. Honest the only store you could eat a meal while you shop for free lol.
who else caught the flicker at 13:31. feels like that might get important
I have  a food lion and I live in kentucky.
it is pop
Mat: "might be a while before I and Steph pick up a soda again." *Steph five minutes later*: "Mat where did all the Harris Teeter go?"
Used to live in wilmington, I know and love food lion and herris teaters
can someone explain to me what collage tournaments r because i'm from england and they literally don't exist
Um mat your wife is right the south east of the USA and Florida.  And soda but I too am from the south.
pop
The older ones are probably purposefully going for medicinal flavor because when the companies originally started they were being advertised as medicine and since they haven’t changed their product since then they did not anything to sweeten it up and make it more of a party
Does anyone know why McDonald’s took the snack wrap away
soft drink... i just say soft drink.
Food Lion? I recognize that name from visiting Maryland.
Well...😐
I watch as I drink this delicious throat burning Diet Coke.
b
It’s pop Argument ended
my allegiance is to the republic
Let's be real, Mat only did this because he couldn't get that sweet, sweet Coke sponsorship after all these years.
good mythical morning did this a while ago. i assume he didnt know, but still good content
Blue Yellow type staticky thingy at 13:30
My grandma called "fizz whiz" is that weird?
15:30 i am team water or juice, i don't like carbonate drinks (Carbonite water is the worst thing i have ever tasted it literally came out of my nose) i now drink orange juice to absorb iron better, i don't like orange but i got use to it.
I love how at 33 years old i finally learned what March Madness is thanks toba food channel talkin bout Diet soda! 🤣 i love this channel
i am def a pop but will call it soda
Definitely Soda
Food lion? Harris teeter? Even whole foods!? Dad works in the refrigeration business, and he has come to hate each and every one of those. The only one he has never worked at, is Ingles. Wich should be Ingle's. It's the only one within a thirty minute drive, and the one I work at! Also, soda. I'm in the other bit of southern people that calls it soda.
Yes steph!! Coke Zero is the best
For the can, bottle, fountain. I am the same with mountain dew. If I have a choice I prefer it from the fountain. It doesn't have that metallic or plasticy taste
Cheerwine is the best even though it's not diet.
Me when I read the title: Who are you and what have you done with Matpat?
The food lion one didn't surprise me. They got some good sodas. But shes right if you go somewhere to eat 90% of the time your getting coke to drink.
Soda
I work at Kroger and depending on what company's your local kroger contracts with you might get that brand Cola
In Canada we call it pop
Coke is healthier than diet coke
The only reason why I remember Shasta is the low grade Dr. Pepper lol.
I wish my grandma would
I love the underdog story😍😍
I did a similar thing for the sweet iced tea in my area.
We have a couple Food Lions in Georgia. Along with Food Giant and Piggly Wiggly. But I don't see them around as much as I used to.
B I live and grew up in Seattle I don’t know what that has to do with calling soda soda
A:pop always has and always will be to me (even though i dont drink it anymore). Pop is what i grew up with.
for a moment of pure instinct i thought matt would say "my allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!!" 1:53
Michigan is pop
Is this a prank?
3:45 what did he just say
D:  cola
I have learned lots of places that are here in North Carolina are only in North Carolina
What.  WHAT?!?!? What is going on in the universe?!?!?! OH MA GAWD!!!!  (Also, Ginger Ale all the way)
Where are you going to get good fountain diet coke because not all fountain diet coke is the same
Lol MatPat has spent years trying to get a Diet Coke sponsorship, his new tactic is neg-ing... Ok hope it works! Lol
This episode had a more engaging plot than most sports movies
C
13:30 is that glitch an effect you added or is my computer going crazy?
Arabs: Bepsi
You have the same taste for Diet Coke that I do Dr Pepper. I freaking love Dr. Pepper and all the different flavors you get from buying the bottled, cans, glass, and fountain.  Also soda is what I call it.
I just call it fizzy (I'm British don't bully me)
Diet cola isn’t better for you, the sugar substitute is around 10-100x worse than sugar.
Pop. Always pop.
In the Uk - We call it by the brand's name lol
In Australia we call Cola, Soft Drinks
It matters the context of where pop or soda
I don't remember which state but I once saw a chart that claimed one state called all soda/pop: "lemonade"
i got sad when he mentioned frys because they closed.
*cries in Ingles brand*
Pop shop is great! Also it's called soda pop
I remember him going crazy in school in his videos about diet pepsi
Soda from glass bottles tastes better.
Now I want to try it
PEPSI PEPSI PEPSI PLEASE THAT WOULD BE NICE # NON BIASED
I’ve made my decision. Harris Teeter Shantay you stay! Coke Zero. Diet Coke. My dears I’m afraid neither of you impressed me enough to remain in the competition. I’m going to have to ask you both to sashay away.
I’m not usually one to drink diet soda, so, for me, my favorite soda could be Big Blue. Firstly, anything blue has always drawn my interest and attention since I was younger. It’s possible that this is a bias on my part, since blue is my favorite color, and I just prefer anything with the color to perform well. Secondly, sweetness is another preference of mine, but it does have to compete with just about any flavor for whichever I prefer most. And, lastly, I don’t come across the Big Blue product as often as I would like in the grocery store I frequent. When I do come across it, I just have to get it.
I am 100% a Soda guy, grew up in California although now in the south. Still sticking with Soda still.
Pleeeeeeease do this for diet root beers!!! I have acid refux so most soda physically burns to drink and aspartame gives me headaches, so I been on the hunt for a good alternative for my root beer craving!! So far, I've found diet root beer soda stream is the best.
North Carolina? I thought they lived in LA?
I went to my local food4less and it tasted just like you said with the fruity taste
Try gfuel haha:)
imagine if Harris Teeter had a little heroin in it and that why he likes it
I'm a pop guy. but if there is coke i call it coke. its like its own type of pop that is different from every other pop
I feel a strong urge to say that as a southerner AND a fellow North Carolinian, we do NOT call all sodas "coke." It's either just "drink" or it's "soda." Nothing but love, Steph, but I couldn't let that one go!
Grocery store brands are either private labels from smaller food companies, or if the local Coke/Pepsi bottler has the capacity and the right kind of contract they can sometimes make their own sodas to sell under store/private labels.  The point being, there's no inherent reason they should be bad.
I've never thought I'd hear the phrase " I quit Diet Coke" from MATPAT. If we weren't sure the world was ending this definitely shows it is.
14:38. Nope, I read the origami yoda books.
Ever tried Russian sodas?
Virginia residents, who also have Food Lion: "Are we a joke to you?"  Also, B, obviously.
I lived in North Carolina for a bit. There was this peach soda called Nehi that I really enjoyed. This gives me such fond memories.
In upper Wisconsin we say soda and older people say pop
#harristeeter sponsor this man!
“North Carolina based Food Lion” like your southern brother ain’t got it too
Did matpat move
I'm a, b, and c
When I saw this appear in my subscriptions box, I found it hard to believe. I thought that this video was gonna show that Mat learned information about Diet Coke that made him come to the ultimate decision of giving up Diet Coke. Regardless, I was surprised to learn that Mat actually didn't drink any during 2020. I wonder if he had withdrawal headaches or cravings.  I usually say "soda".
Coke Zero all day long
I say coke
Stephanie rocking that Surprised Pikachu face at Matpat’s reveal. 🤣
In Illinois I personally say Soda AND Pop
This is also the plot of the fall selection arc in Food Wars
Pop not soda!!!!!! Onomatopia it makes sense
You guys are a adorable couple.
Put the subtitles on at 3:43 lol
Houston TX, we say Soda. Ask for coke, you'll get coke.
Didn't realize you guys were in NC, if your ever in the Charlotte area, stop by Ghostface Scratch kitchen,  I'm one of the chefa there and would love to treate you guys to a meal, have a good day
Cherry Pepsi gang where you at!? Guys?
I am pop and soda
I’ve heard Diet Coke jokes from this channel for years, sad for them to be gone
Says soda sucks continues drinking it
Coke Zero is clearly the best
As someone who works at Harris Teeter, seeing the final result and Mat's choice winner was surprising, but nice to see. Never thought I'd work at store that sells that good of Soda, now I'm tempted to get some for myself after I get off my shift lol
How about the best soda when flat. Because that’s what happened here!!! I’m sure they weren’t bubbly by the end. XD    But also, it’s Mountain Dew Code Red.
Matt I love ya man but as a fellow ohioan its soda
0 calories sodas be like
Stevia sweetener is way better in Maple syrup then in cola drinks
Seriously? Stevia is too sweet? I'm about ready to toss out the stevia-sweetened stuff I have because I can't stand it without adding sugar. Also, B. And yes, the acids in Zero turn me off.
That was a fun video
GOOD FOR YOU!!!
From Texas here, and we are 100% Coke!   I didn't even know that there were other names for it till I was in Junior High.  Which is funny, because Dr. Pepper is from Texas, but we still call everything Coke!
It has happened matpat have changed his way.
Nooooooooooooo
I say pop and soda, where I come from both those words are used
C=COKEEEEEE
D. Other: Water
13:30 was I the only one to notice the screen bug ?
You where the chosen one you bring balins the cockavers not leve it darcks
Maybe you could make this into a full theory, but I have been told from nutritionists that the calories in soda are "empty" meaning not associated with weight gain. A few google searches also seems to suggest diet soda is linked to more weight gain than regular. On top of that diet soda seem to have a stigma that they are more likely to cause cancer than regular soda. So do you really just prefer diet soda cause of the taste or is it more so conditioned that the diet soda are supposed to be healthier and therefore we believe they are, even if some evidence points in the other direction.
In Aus we call "soda" soft drink
I think every Nerd has a certain quirk. His is drinking a lot of Pop/Soda.
I saw the title and thought...  "Wait whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat"
Yo, just drink Mountain dew. Its the BEST!!(in my opinion...)
I QUIT DC  does matt hate the DC universe?
Me drinking cotton candy soda: 0^0
Steph: *calls it soda* Mat: *calls it pop* Me:.... *calls it lemonade* ;w;
Not sure if a editing glitch/quirk but just after 13:30 there was a visual and auditory huccup, possibly an AR piece? Just pointing out for those who can/want to dig deeper.
I just hope he makes the switch to Pepsi Max
Copy and paste this comment if you think he should do a food theory about all nerds tasting the same because they do.
I drink mostly sparkling waters to get the fizzy effect without the sugar, takes a little adjusting if you're used to Coke, but it's great
Stephanie looks soooo beautiful in this video 😍🥰 I love you Stephanie ❤️
My husband is big into Zevia. He thinks that the caffeine free cola is *way* better than the regular cola.
Yeiks diet coke. Sugar or no coke!
Diet soda are disgusting
What I learned  today  Put Citrix acid on your cereal.        It will probably be fine.
Huh never knew Publix was regional..... I've always lived near them so...
the temperature is missing
As someone who lives in the northWedt BigK gave me the same reaction as mat to it's flavor As someone who doesn't like diet sodas I'm not going to drink it but it does have that diet soda taste while having the fruity aswell
coke
Well this is something
just make sure you try all brands as freshly amde as posible because sugar free colas tendo to go sour very quickly, sometimes in a week after being bottled
Years in the making
Did you know, people familiar with each other have a higher chance at tying in Rock, paper, scissors.
Coke Zero smack
Harris Teeter just went crazy wow
I didn’t know food lion is from nc
Im a soda person
u know this one is exclusive in india and asiatic shops and stuff but ohhh god thumbs up is way better than diet pepsi or cola in my opinion
I live in Illinois and I call it soda
this is like a inspirational sports movie where Harris teeter is the one kid that dreams to be a professional and is never let in because of like asthma or something but when he gets in he is like really good and wins like some huge competition
Soda 🥤
A or B+A
Soda
Do we hear a Harris Teeter sponsorship coming up? (Diet Coke - you missed out!)
I have those same plastic cups :D
Here in Brazil we have two very different sodas that, believe it or not, are very different  and even different  brands. Guarana Antartica and Guarana Jesus. The first one is kind of a normal colored soda but a bit more yellow, and have some rivals, like Kuat, that's from Coca Cola and worse, and Dolly, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT DOLLY. And the second one is kind of a pinky water.
Im a soda. people who say Pop are fine but I think we can all agree those who say soda-pop or coke are wrong
Isn't there a Sprite Zero?
What's up with the video glitch at 13:31
A&w is a good soda also rip Diet Coke memes and darn just got to he criteria
A B C and D I was raised in the north and the south so I bounce around the words knowing it's the same meaning.
dark horse harris teeter for the win! :D
Good video as always, but wow it amazes me that people actually find diet soda tasty... Its so gross.
Matt have you ever thought of Coke zero sugar
If you’re used to consuming stevia, the zevia is really good. If you aren’t used to stevia it’s very obvious and a completely different flavour.  I love Coke Zero (and it will always be Coke Zero) and am not a big fan of Diet Coke. My husband likes Diet Coke and not zero.  Pop. Soda is soda water.
I'm still waiting for a FANF theory on this channel
This like when they stopped Pingu fucking sad
This video makes my tounge tingly, like I’m drinking a soda.
I move from NC to Texas and we always went to food lion
Diet Coke has been dethroned
Try Zero sodas my dude
Coke zero gang rise
NO! I REFUSE! HE'S BEEN ADDICTED FOR SO LONG THAT ITS A MEME!  Okay well anyway, Mug rootbeer, actual dr pepper, and pepsi will have the best place in my heart  He never did get that diet coke sponsorship  I actually went on a bit of a coke zero craze SEVERAL years ago
Everybody knows that Dr.Pepper the best soda
C:coke,Texan
when talking about Cola flavoured drinks in finland they are all referred to as Kolas (Cola with a k).   when talking about all kinds of sodas we use Limu or Limsa (short for Limonadi which is  Lemonade).  Limonadi does not refer to only citrus flavoured drinks,  it refers to all
This is just an elaborate plan to get Steph addicted to diet coke
Wow I didn't know food lion was a North Carolina thing, there's one up in Rangely Maine so I figured it was a North Eastern thing.
Try sparkling ice
soda, I didn't no people called it soda, every signal one
I am a southern soda man but I also ironically saw sodie-pop
You should try guarana from brasil
13:31 exactly, hmmm
You know you married the right person, when you cant beat eachother in rock-paper-sissor.
wegmans cola is crying rn
D in Canada we call them by there names
soda
Get a pepsi max cherry flavour my friend
I’m surprised Laura lynn from ingles didn’t make an appearance
Bam Pepsi better product byfare
B. Soda
Noooo
It's a sign!
Mountain dew

You didn't really quit soda if you're gonna just go right back to another brand of soda. It's still soda. -_-
I got a Pepsi ad while watching this-
In Michigan we call it "Soda-pop from Meijer"
I can’t believe I just watched a video about a man drinking soda and finding it funny while I have never ever tasted any soda expect sprite in my entire life xD
8:08 anybody else see that green flash or just me?
Y u look like morg
What this episode has made me realise: Steph is way better at explaining tastes than Mat.
This can't be true...WHERE IS REAL MATPAT!!! TELL ME NOWWWWWWW
Diet coke lover here, I live near a Kroger and can say that what you describe of Harris Tetter's diet soda sounds exactly how Kroger's brand diet soda tastes.
talk about an underdog story

This is literally what happened with New Coke when it came out. Small little sommelier taste tests liked New Coke more but when drinking a whole glass, it became disgustingly sweet. Harris Teeter probably would become annoying with the citric acid over 32oz compared to the royalty that is Diet Coke. MatPat, please don't fall into the sample size error.  #DietCoke4Life
Great, MatPat has given up Diet Coke. Now I have to prepare for the apocalypse.
Try apple fresh juice, my personal fav drink
its stephh
In NZ we call it Fizzy haha
Nope.
Yall need to do a video on BBQ when Lexington has their BBQ festival. Maybe try to prove if Lexington is truly the BBQ capitol.
Professional wine tasters, eat your heart out!     Or would it be "drink your heart out"?
are you kidding me? I know food lion they used to be right by my house I miss them
🥤 soda
Nooooo diet coak (even tho diet coak
Why drink diet Coke when you can drink :                    diet meth
I'm Croatian, so I'm other, we call it "gazirano piće", meaning "carbonated drink". We call coke "cola", and all other drinks like pepsi, sprite, etc. we just call by their name. We don't have a lot of them here though, just coke, sprite, pepsi, fanta, there used to be 7up around 20 years ago, but I haven't seen it in a while. Although people here don't really drink sodas that much, especially kids. We mostly just drink water, coffee, tea, milk etc.
WHAT-
“Oh no MatPat is quitting his Diet Coke!!!!” *”Anyways....onto the next brand-“* *Harris teeter is the winner and secretly works with Diet Coke.*
Jokes on you I don't drink soda.
I just realized that Mat and MrBeast live in NC
it is a good thing that they stopped the rock paper scissors. If regular show has shown me anything, it would have ended very badly
To sad that you live in the US and not in Germany. Over here we have a better cola (in my opinion) called fritz-kola.
I live in MD but we have food lions here, personally i think that food lion brand foods are usually pretty good.
13:30 is just a small video glitch. not one frame message :(
I don’t have time to watch right now but I’m scared
aspartame moment
deep lockdown take: watching people share drinks has become offensive to me.
MatPat: Oh no! I need another entry for the list! Harris Teeter: Sigh. Put me in coach. I'm not as big as some other lables, but I got spirit behind this cap.  Harris Teeter: The underdog who fought their way to the top.
Alright. I see Zevia, love Zevia personally.
Use some nd filters please
Matt, I'll level with ya, you ought to kick that crap anyway, the sweetener they use, aspartame, is a proven carcinogen. You're basically drinking a cigarette.
:O
I loved Coke zero almost as much as Mat loves Diet Coke. I tried the HEB brand (Texas) version of it and it's WAY better. Store brands are pretty good sometimes
am a southen boy  so  everting is  coke
soda
Stevia has been know for hundreds of years by the tribes of South America, and known to Western Society for about a hundred years.  It's a natural plan to help decrease fertility.
Food lion is also in tennessee in east and middle tn
The nectar of the gods is gone
No way is matpat quitting. Everyone knows Diet Coke is as addictive as when they used cocaine in the soda.
halfway through this video i realised i was drinking fountain diet cola cause i ordered McDonald's and never in my life has something been so well fitting jfhxhdhf
Its been pop as long as I can remember
Food lion is also in GA.
Am I the only one but do I slow it down at the exact part Matt patt stocks the Diet Coke and laugh profusely
All hope is lost in 2021
YES FINALLY DIET COKE IS MORE DANGEROUS IT WOULD OF KILLED YOU
*Me quietly sipping my Arizona Green Tea*
It’s coke it’s all coke
DIET COKE O YA
As a southerner i can confirm, everyone does call it coke.
Duuuude I've stopped drinking soft drinks a few years ago.  My longest streak was 7 months.  Soft drinks give me stomach aches
Matpat go home your drunk
Are you okay, Matt? I'm genuinely concerned rn
I really dislike the cola flavor. I find it very yucky. I like other soda flavors though!
I as a florida man can say that florida has literally publix at any turn, my literal first time spelling was saying, look mom its a publix where shopping is a pleasure!!!
In Australia we drink soft drink
Diet coke rots your brain!
after this I'm going to Harris Teeter for some soda
Thought this was clickbait
im from the south and its ALWAYS soda    wow mat pat. I didn't know you could pull it of
WHAT HERESY IS THIS!?!?
Coke!
I wonder how much money a year matpat will save buying the store brand vs. name brand
OK I’m just saying raspberry tea Doobie doing
B
iON water is amazing. IF YOU NEED SODA for SODA sake, the CANNED DIET DR PEPPER!
Im am D: soft drink   We call it that in Australia
B or C
Pop all the way!
soda is just crunchy water
I saw a marianos brand cola and from your discription was very simular
*Impossible*
I have a reaction to aspartame so most diet sodas I've never tried. They really should stop using it. It's also in all chewing gums except the cinnamon flavored ones. Diet Cheerwine uses splenda thankfully.
It’s just a soft drink here down under. All cola is just branched  under coke
I’m like Matt but with AW Root Beer
im rooting for Harris teeter its close  tome to plus then my dad will buy it
Cold Drinks or Soda
there is this candy store that I went to with a lot of old style sodas, and weird ones like peanut butter. It is in Virginia and u said ur in north Carolina which is close...
diet coke can give u cancer
anyone else notice that the video got a bit corrupted at 13:30
But but but but The brand mat THE BRAND
Soda
Look no further than Dr. Thunder offbrand dr pepper.
Nice clickbait I know you will be “re-addicted” to it in a week ;)
Me After Seeing Title: THE FU
I must be in an Atlanta area bubble? I've still never once been asked what kind of Coke I want when I ask for Coke and the Coke headquarters is in Atlanta lol. Been here 7 years and they just bring me a Coke without asking what kind 🤷🏻‍♀️
Diid matpat just say he likes harris teeter due to it beeing a fruity bottom ?
Now *this* is the saddest YouTube breakup I’ve ever seen.
alright everyone. send MattPatt your local kroger cola! lol.
Harris teeter cola sales are going to skyrocket.
I'm disappointed they knew what they were drinking… It’s not really a blind taste test.
FOOD LION HAD STORES OR MAY STILL HAVE LOCATIONS IN FLORIDA just wanted to put that out there so yes ive heard of food lion
Not here but Inca Cola is literally   Literally the Golden Cola 😂  Edit: its part of the cola brand and has a zero calorie version but it's not in the soda section. Its in the latin food section.
This reminds me of those "6 out of 10 Pepsi Drinkers prefer Coke." Taste test, where they overload the tasters with a flavor they know so that the new flavor stands out and becomes "prefered"
I really enjoy sams cola
I just watched a grown man try diet soda for around 30 min and was thoroughly entertained amazin
Boylan root beer and cream soda slaps
What about glass bottle diet coke? That's always hit different...
I’ve grown up in Myrtle Beach, SC and it was so weird to hear him say that people probably haven’t heard of Food Lion 😆 Also, I’ve never heard anyone refer to all soda as Coke. I’ve lived in the south since I was 5 and never met anyone that does that haha! Everyone here just says the kind of soda they want (Dr. Pepper, Mtn Dew, Pepsi, Coke, etc).
[b]
If you got the fountain from McDonald's its different than other fountains because of how its shipped and stored.
I'm a coke
Here in Tx I’m more familiar with coke or soda
... Okay this video title shook me for a second Matpat without diet coke just seems wrong
The title makes it seem like Matpat is gonna make video theorizing that Matpat stopped drinking diet coke years ago and was lying to Matpat the entire time.
C. Coke
The flavour of Diet Coke depends on the water they use to make it. So in different countries the taste will be different. For example I really like Sprite, but as a Chilean i find the US´sprite too sweet.
The old timey cola tasting like cough syrup makes sense as cola was originally made for treating colds
Harris teeter got the drip
C:coke
Stephanie looks so good!!
Here in Aus it’s either soft drink, or just the specific brand and flavour you want
3:46 what?!
I think it should be Coke because when someone says Soda and I imagine sparkle water. This is the way we call stuff here. Never Soda means anything else. Btw I never imagine there can be so many kinds of companies, and I mean big companies, except Pepsi and Coca-Cola..I thought there would be some garbage companies in some countries
B
Everybody: So do you say pop or soda? Me: I say the name of the drink Everybody:😳😬😤🤬
your lack of bubba cola from Save A Lot and Diet Coke Splenda disturbs me.
Considering I live in Shasta County, I was kind of hoping Shasta would win.  Oh well, such is as it is.
This is so sad...
Graphical error 8:09
This is not real I thought when I clicked on the video
perfect character arc for matpat in this season
I live in North Carolina
Virgil’s is king
Praise the almighty citrus.
As a DC Comics fan, I often call it "Soder".
Ohh that’s another one for apocalypse bingo
C. Coke
Soda Stream Diet Cola.
And no! I ill miss the diet coke joke
The moment I saw the title I unsubbed and disliked
We call that here softdrinks
Harris Teeter the anime underdog protag of 2021.
I don't know if it's a UK thing or not but I just call it fizzy juice
Join the Sprite line bucko, you’ll need it.
Soda is the correct way to say it
WHAT!?!?!?!!,!?!?!?!
hearing talk about that after taste , made me remember the original apple fanta , had that after taste so good, i loved it, but it got removed and never returned , the green apple dont come closer .
Dr peper
Soda Pop? You mean Soft Drink. (Australian)
Great video, hopefully you do one on Dr. Pepper at some point. Lots of imitation brands such as Dr. Thunder to choose from.
Diet coke I to matpat what sprite is to my friends and what Dr pepper is to me
I call everything coke
hi
I say mostly pop but also soda
I wanted to search for how I could make my first game but this popped up so now im intrested
fake vodep
But like.. does this mean diet coke×matpat is over
Me, being allergic to Diet Sodas "Ah yes, interesting."
pepsi max lime is the best
im in Australia we call it softdrink
Finally. I’ve been telling you for years. In the comments.
I am a pop person and in my family if you call it soda you don't get any pop.
Hey when are you going to eat a pine tree again?
I’m call it soda but my dad calls it coke and I always say that it isn’t coke it’s soda also my mom and sister say pop
Milkis is korean and it’s good(recommend apple taste)
Finally the Diet Coke gods have finally answered the call an gave the world wat it needed a Diet Coke episode of the best  an only food theory channel on the internet!!!!!
We have King Soopers here, a Front Range supermarket chain that was bought out by Kroger decades ago. I haven't tried their generic brand diet cola, but I did buy their Coke Zero and Cherry Coke Zero equivalents and liked them both a lot.
I thought Florida was the ninth planet. I mean, have you seen their news?
Don't scroll down!
as somebody who has had fred meyer brand soda before, yea its almost identical to what matt described
C
From Ontario, Canada here, and I say pop. I must say, I really don't understand your obsession with DIET pop, I just can't drink the stuff. In saying that, I do prefer cane sugar colas when they are available, and literally what defines whether I drink Coke or Pepsi is which one happens to be on sale... lol. So with you choosing a diet cola with a citric acid edge, I do wonder if some of the outlier fruit flavour added colas might edge it out.
Go diet rite
Harris teeter diet cola need a solo episode
Says "you probably never heard of Food Lion" yet hear i am bascally living there because i love there mini pizza's.
Most "store" bands are just named bands that are sold cheaper
no
Should have added when you gave undertale to the pope at the start
shasta is the dollar store soda.
Has Diet Coke ever sponsored Matt? Because if not, they REALLY should!
be careful drinking so much soda.. can cause Oxalate Crystals buildup in your kidneys
I also only would choose coke because of the great Batman commercial 1984 batman
Go pepsi light, you wont regret it
I don't like diet soda. I'm a regular cola guy.
Every Minnesotan calls it pop and wouldn’t ya know so do I
Omg
Im bubbly drink thing
Food theory is dite soda really zero calories
To be fair Steph is right we mostly say Soda or Coke down here it’s weird but true
Food lion is in VA, everywhere, really ;-;
I'm surprised Safeway wasn't included at the end there both Fry's and Smith's are branch offs of Albertsons. But we do have Big K diet Coke in the store so I'll have to check it out
You can definitely tell these two share the same brain XD
heh... When you don't see kvass, a Slavic/Baltic drink from rye bread... Altho I know it's not in the MatPats category, just throwing a piece of information that it exists
Oddly enough, I'm also a huge Diet Coke drinker, like every day. And for years, my go-to has been Diet Coke with a splash of lemon juice or a dash of vanilla. So the fact that the Harris Teeter "Diet Cola + Citric Acid" won was interesting.
I know not many people are going to care about this comment but why is there random green bars at the 4:06 mark? it just flashes then vanishes was this a editing error or is this youtube? Edit: 8:10 had green flashing as well which tells me who ever edited this video either needs to downgrade there editing software to a older version or to upgrade there pc i normally don't see this unless the software it starting to become to much for the pc or some hardware was damaged. Or maybe replace the camera's they might have been damaged at some point without anybody realizing.
Cococola with cocane
HUH??!!
Soda
*me after seeing the title*: Yeah, Right.
When I saw the title, I said out loud “Who are you, and what have you done with Mat?!”
Imagine if MATPAT HAS A COVID (HOPE NOT) He will miss diet Coke Lmao
In the south, coke is the universal language for Soda
I think this is a fake MatPat who is tricking us.
I've been loving food theory since it debuted and especially now that Steph has stepped back for GTLive, I'm even more excited to see her so much on this channel!
Am not Ness
a
Well. I'm sold. Update. Apparently, there is no trace of this Diet coke from Harris Teeter. At least a trace to get them here in Canada.
uhhhh matpat I think your fottage got corrupted
i call Bs, he’s not gonna change
his wife is so hot, literally the only reason im watching this video. same for the stupid bread gloves video
Opcion D other, in México we call sodas chescos
C. Coke
I was surprised when mat said harris teeter isn't common on the east coast, there's a couple in maryland that aren't very far from me
18:13 im drinking coke zero right now wile eating popcorn
Bro look at stefany she looks like if matpat is some sicopat
i be a soda
In Scotland it's (fizzy) juice
Pepsi is gonna win
I always feel like sodas from fast food places are way sweeter than usual, especially ice tea. They definitely put a lot of sugar in there
I knew he would gain the intelligence to join Pepsi
Soft drink
I'm a Hoosier and it is most definitely pop. Lol
Food fact
A.
Harris teeter needs it's own anime
never realized Harris Teeter, Food Lion, and Publix were all regional. I think I might go down to Harris Teeter to try some now. Thanks Matpat.
B
Dissing aspertam but endorsing stevia…
I thought food lion was all over the  US to me its like an everyday name
The title: Top ten anime twists of all time
B
Im in the midwest and I call it Soda We used to Have Food 4 less In my City But then they Replaced It with Bakers.. 6 year old mind: How could you Kroger Lol
In Ireland everyone says fizzydrinks so D.
I'm a simple man. I read the title, I get concerned, I watch the video.
I  just hate soda just no why u have to carbonate it
Where I’m from we all say pop
7:03 uhhh what the glitch
B
NC gang Hey matpat since you live in NC have you ever tried cheerwine?
I don't live in the USA but I prefer to call them "soda". I feel like calling all sodas "cola" is like calling all ZTE Blades, Samsung Galaxies and Huawei Mate phones iPhones.
Would have preferred a better background than a washed out window
Juice
Where I live we call all these drinks Soft Drinks and only use specific names when ordering them or talking to different kinds of Soft Drinks
I swear matpat lived in LA
No Dr Pepper??? Literally the best. Also diet Dr Pepper imo is the only diet soda where it tastes the same as the original
Soda Wegman's is in the Raleigh area now - you should have included their Diet Cola
Funny, your Pepsi 0 sugar has "Max Taste" written on it. In Europe it's instead called Pepsi Max, which fits the slogan a lot better
how and why?
I didn't know you were in NC
On the plus side I bet Harris Teeter will be a lot more likely to sponsor you than Diet Coke lmao
Wait I thought food lion existed everywhere in the US
Yo I think God saw Matt doing good charity work so he decided to give him his new diet Coke
He is me in a nutshell
This is the day... When Matpat says...      Harris Teeter is better than Diet Coke
soda>>
D I like dr pepper
What?! No Dr. Pepper?! Texans have left the chat
I’m in the south but I have never categorized all soda as coke so I’m a soda person but if it is just cola I call it coke
Just a fun fact food lion is acually part of a store chain most common in belgium,france and the netherlands only here it is called delhaize.
Go Illini!!!! Whoo!!
There are Food Lions in SC not just NC
i havent watched the vid at the time of making this comment and all i have to say is thats not allowed
In USA they had diet coke in 1950's, here in East Europe we still didn't had the regular one easy to find. It was a rare product on specific western shops :D . Btw the first thing I have noticed is he got rid of few kilograms. I feel like he wanted it, I hope it is result of good mindset, if I am expressing myself correctly or enough understandable.
I call it soft drink
in UK we say fizzy never heard anyone in UK say pop or soda
i live in sc and i was genuinely surprised to see that some of these grocery stores weren't well known across the us
Vanilla Coke🤤
You really did publix dirty like that
Also from la, Shreveport
o7 to those who he didnt choose.
19:02 you have the same mind but different taste buds
Next vids upload there is an extra batch of diet coke under his sons bed
The ending made me cry.  There're no Krogers in my area and they're my ABSOLUTE favorite diet root beer.  (Been wanting to make a 2 hour trip just to get a bunch of diet root beer.)  That said, here's another option for Mr and Mrs Pat:  Set up a kegerator, but fill it with water.  50 lbs co2 pressure for carbonation and 10-15lbs for maintainence.  You'll be able to make your own soda that way.  Fun to experiment with odd flavors and cheaper in the long run.  I usually make mine by either kool-aid packets, singles to go, or best of all Torani syrups and their competitors.  Some of the off brands I find at Tuesday morning have some really weird flavors so I currently have the options of cookie dough, cinnamon, candied apple, and mint chocolate.  The absolute best, though was a butter rum they had around Christmas. Side note:  I'm diabetic, so stuck with diet sodas and there's not always much option for me, especially since I hate both diet coke and diet pepsi.  I'm also burnt out on diet Dr Pepper.  If a place doesn't have coke zero or a freestyle machine, I end up drinking water or.... restaurant version of my home soda game, I carry a squeeze bottle flavor enhancer (mio, etc) and just order club soda when eating out so I can make my own sodas there too.
I used to enjoy Diet Coke for as long as I can go for, but I'm mostly going for Coke Zero over it. So, I'm with Stephanie's side of the final decision. Coke Zero for life.
I call it coke
I’ve personally been to food lion
Hahahaha. I know all of these grocery stores and can confirm. Harris Teeter has a really good brand name stuff as well as Food Lion!
Matt...this is apart of your brand...this isn’t mat this it’s a robot human robot with a hypno disk in its xhest
Zevia is poggers
This video has not only shook the Internet but has sent ripples through the Multiverse as well.
Pog
I've always called it a carbonated beverage
Just buy Diet Harris Teeter and Diet Coke Zero so you both can enjoy your favorite sodas. There's no reason why one soda has to dominate the fridge.
Walk in Champion of our H e a r t !
I’ve been told that those drinking diet sodas, because of the sweeteners, have a higher chance of developing Alzheimer's. I’ve not fact checked this yet but I’m just wondering what your thoughts are on this before I do so
WHAT?!
W-WH *YOU CANT DO THAT, ITS YOUR THIRD BRAND*
I think somebody broke game theory. First Stephanie is leavening GTLive and now he’s quitting Diet Coke. Why Mat?
We say soda or what flavor soda do you want? Mats girl trippin she prolly from a back water town in nc we say soda
20:54 when your sibling betrays you and tells on you
me growing up in NC and knowing all of these markets
Zero is best like if you agree 😃🥃
i call it hip dip bippy pop
As someone who lives in North Carolina and doesn’t shop much at Harris teeter much and food lion even less, I’m surprised both did as good as they did. I am not surprised Harris teeter beat out food lion though  Edit: HARRIS TEETER WON??! Wow. I’m shocked.
Matt I am from Georgia now in South Carolina and I know I of publix and food lion
Baker's is my neighborhood, I can get the matpat approved  diet cola!
Food Lion is French by the way, they have the same logo as the original stores back over here across the pond where they're called Delhaize
I love his voice
I've never really been a cola guy. I'm more of an A&W root beer from a glass bottle kind of guy.
I'm just soda
Is Pepsi zero what Americans call Pepsi Max or are they different? 🤔
pop
Since when's Dr. Pepper not a cola?
I hate zevia
I’m a pop man I’m from Canada
can u do a episode some time that gives light to rdh2s existence not many pp know rdh2 is a rabbit hommerage disease that is new to the us and kills many bunnys a vaccine exists but we dont have a manufacturer in us yet so it has to be imported it would mean alot to me and many ppl in bunny community and could save thousands of bunnys whos owners dident know
Harris Teeter was the protagonist the whole time, it rose to the top notch even expecting to be included.. but that's just a theory, a diet theory, thanks for sippin
spoilerish:  kroger brand soda’s are phenomenal. i’m obsessed with their cherry cola one! i’m glad they won tbh.
I am soda
Harris Teeter cola was like you've activated my trap card : CITRIC ACID
But diet coke was your thing all those crinjy diet coke jokes that's why I subbed(jk)
diet coke is nasty
*When you live in NC* Ha....
The scrolling disclaimer about Mat's diet soda intake at the beginning has two T's in Mat. I don't know what to believe anymore
Plot twist: Gaijin Goomba went Stealth 100 and emptied all the non-Diet Coke brands out to literally just fill it with regular Diet Coke. Real Shinobi sneak action there.
The next day at H-T: _Let's re-formulate our soft drinks line!_ New drinks line: *cheap garbage* MatPat: *_NOOOOOOOOO_*
Mat: Shaft-sa!!!😁😁😁😁  Stephanie: 😒(*I am married to a child!*)  Love you two!😂
I choose coffee with I've and some times add soda water.since it's like the first part of soda anyways and I keep off all those extra calories
*I'm
Matpat: gives up diet come, Me: wait that's illegal
NOOOOO impossible!!!!!!!
Senku Cola anyone? Does the recipe actually work? does the Foxtail millet ramen recipe actually work? I would love to know.
Everyone here in Belize calls em soft drinks
you know that is junk right and why are you drinking sooooo many junk that's unhealthy
It’s not all coke that’s big cap
B!
Coca Cola didn’t sponsor matpat. He gave up Coca Cola in revenge
Mitsuya Cider Zero. Japan. That stuff is great
I  Love 7 U P !!!!!
Diet coke   i feel betrayed 😥🥤
Boylan cream soda is good
I always wondered, why DIET coke? If you don't to answer, that's ok.
pop
The worst Coke I ever tasted was Live Soda's probiotic cola. So nasty
Imma SODA
8m c
You can tell he's having fun with this channel
I don't have this cola in my country, guess I'll just drink diet coke.
COKE ZERO
WHAT!?   I M P O S S I B L E
B
I live in nc so its always been coke
Imposter mat would never stop drinking Diet Coke
Why?
It actually happened
Boylan has lots of flavors, and some of the “classic” flavors have older tastes to them, the root beers and colas have flavors that you don’t find anymore, takes a bit to get used to. Like the root beer has a touch of mintiness which is a little weird to what most companies do.
B
soda
Me reading the title: NOOOOOO
Impossible
As a North Carolinian, I can confirm we are at a shortage of good cola in North Carolina
D
Hey guys he's ADDICTED and he happened to hazbin theory the other day
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DONT YOU CANT PLEASE
B.
I challange you Matpat. The reason you rated your favorite so highly was because you were tired of the cola taste and it was different, so you liked it more. The other different options were always bad, your favorite was different in a good way. I think it would be interesting if you returned to this in like 2 weeks and had the 3 top picks again and chose from that.
We have Food Lions in Virginia as well.
B: Soda.
I think what you should have done is make cups 1-16 pour the drinks in those and reveal the drinks at the VERY end
Harris Teeter is under the Kroger brand family btw
soda is disgusting and unhealthy, drink water mate.
I hate diet coke or diet Sprite. It taste horrible.
Game theory is the channel that makes bad jokes, as that is the thing I think of when I hear the name.
I call it "Läsk" since I'm from sweden ;-;
Pop-soda     but actually, Soda-pop.
*sees title*  Me: ⊙.⊙
Many people My family, including me are actualy mildy allergic to aspartame. It gives us super bad head aches
Maybe it’s because I grew up with it, but I am NOT a huge fan of Diet Coke. I’m all about Coke Zero, then Diet Pepsi...  it Fresca is also a top pick for me.
HOW DOES MATPAT LOOK SO YOUNG HE HAS TO BE 25 AT LEAST XD
When did they move to North Carolina?
We have food lion and Harris teeter in Virginia
19:07 they we're ment for each other
We say soda here.... But i have family from new york state that say pop.
fanta is my favorite soda is from my contry chile is goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood is up there with ginger ale in my favorite soda list
When a Harris teeter just got built next to where u live 😃
B
Isn’t diet soda worse for you?!
I work at dillions now I’m really thinking ab trying the big kas
His Diet Coke sponsorship must have ran out
Citric acid is a part of the illuminati
I saw the thumbnail I was SHOCKED
The zero sugar Coca-Cola coce
We use pop and soda here
4:05 I saw a glitch so am I just reading too much into things or is that meant to be there I saw it again at 13:29
Coke uses Chinese labour camps that violate so many human rights and work many men, women and children to death, not saying don't drink it just saying u should probably know
i call it soda
Lmao I live in SC so right down the way from NC and we have Harris Teeters and I can confirm there diet cola is quite exquisite
U Live in North Carolina in North My cousin lives there when I've been you're many times How is this possible
If their reaction to Boylan was that bad I wonder what would happen if they tried Moxie. XD
do you think the results would be different if they had a grace period for the final or had some sort of palate cleanser?
Hay Matt patt next thing you know there is a new side zero to hero diet coke or zero to hero diet Pepsi and if that is a thing can you tell me 😁
*Not gonna lie, I had a heart attack when I saw the title of this video.* 😂
So why do you only drink diet colas, like why not drink the regular colas that don't have a bunch of artificial sweeteners and chemicals in them to make it seem like it has zero calories
Dont do diet coke children
A pivotal moment in history
This was wonderfully fun!
When will we get a true "Sweetener-off"? I want to see Cane Sugar, Beet Sugar, Corn Syrup, and Honey go head to head and match up with Sweet'n'Low (saccharin), Equal (aspartame), Spenda (sucralose), and Truvia (stevia). Which is sweeter? Which tastes better. Which is healthier?
NO... THE TITLE DECEIVES ME!!
I always went said soda but everyone else here in the Midwest calls it pop
I like coke. So I say coke. I’m from Mississippi though.
Moxxie
Does aspartame (artificial sweetener) primarily found on diet coke cause cancer?
Who is this guy? I'm looking for matpat. Not this non-diet coke fake.
Do sushi
I am b soda
what's with the weird frames of color that happen every once in a while? 13:30
harris teeter sales after this📉📉📉📉
As someone who does sugar-free baking/other things, stevia is not good. It works for some things and it's healthier spend a lot of sweeteners, but it's also just.. they described it right yeah. Way too sweet and it overpowers whatever flavor you're going for
I don't understand the "calling everything Coke" thing. Like it is a specific, distinct brand of soda. It's like saying "what's your favorite shade of blue?"  "Orange." Coke is not an umbrella tern for all sodas in the same way blue is not an umbrella term for all colors. It just doesn't make sense.
Mat pat : I quit Diet Coke Me: impossible
U should try Coke Zero cherry. If u like the citrus it’s very good. Helps me and my craving for coke.
Here to throw in my own experience with diet drinks. I would have 2-3 cans a day and I got headaches, heartburn, and heart palpitations. I stopped and I feel so much better.
Pop because I'm Canadian
I have a food lion and I live in GA lol
The pumpkin spice for Mattpat challenge.
Diet soda is worse for your body than regular soda.
Dude, this was a very intriguing episode! XD Also, HUZZAH from North Carolina!! I have both Harris Teeter and Food Lion within walking distance from my place~ xD They are much cheaper (especially Food Lion) than most stores, and I agree that they have ultra-delicious soda <3
Maybe Matt should stop drinking pop
X to Doubt
Also its fizzy in Scotland
Did anyone keep seeing a flash a slight noise alter near 13:31
Rootbeer is the best soda, I might be alone in that opinion but it's true
I think it would help your tests if you cleansed your pallet with a sip of water in between drinks
It's soda, u can't tell me otherwise, pops just weird and calling everything coke is confusing
We have Food 4 Less here in Fresno California. I’ll do a taste test vs Diet Coke when I get the chance. Edit: Big K is the F4L brand and it has Citric Acid.
I’ve been watching MatPat for 4 years now and I  didn’t even know he lived in North Carolina
So no joke, when I saw all the choices, I was actaully a little sad that there was no Kroger brand, because when I was a kid, that was usually the one store brand that would hold up to the "real" stuff...so the fact that it might be the same as Harris Teeter is awesome.
My family’s from the south, though I live in the Midwest, so I’ve grown up with soda, but gotten used to hearing it called pop.
I call it heavy carbonated sweet enjoyment liquid.
Pepsi diet coke is a good option
How is this a Theory?
Didn’t he used to live in California?
I saw the title and was like 'wait what? Not matt patt! He would never!'
As a North Carolinian the real mind blow was all the grocery stores I didn't realize were regional.
MattPat is like me for regular Coke. Canned Coke and some McDonnald's Cokes are the best Coke. All other fountains and all bottles are inferior.
B
something about the editing in this video was amazing lol
I actually live here in North Carolina, I'm actually close to the border with South Carolina but I've always known it as soda I have never heard anyone ask what kind of coke someone wants, that could easily be mistaken for a very different kind of Coke
root beer
B
The winner is Kofi Kingston to Diet Coke Splenda's Mustafa Ali.
Here where I live plastic coke is legendary you can't find it easily and glass sucks kinda can is also really good
B
Ok, we need a citric acid theory now
me: **sees title**        also me: *impossible*
17:40 yeah, Caffiene
Pepsi
Does anyone else notice flashes of like green-ish bars throughout the entire video??
B
me seeing title be like you betrayer
You were talking about food lion and that we probably never heard of it, but it is also a supermarket chain in Belgium, but under the name Delhaize. Weird that they are connected though
B
Lemon water is good
Soda
Who hasent hurd of walmart?
I can't speak for diet sodas, but I can personally confirm that the best root beer is Kroger brand.
D. Spicy water.
B
Chaos theory is 100% infiltrating food theory
15:32 I call it soda
100% Pop
You need to try karma cola diet made here in Britain uses locally sourced ingredients and they are all natural!!
Floridian here I grew up calling it soda
this is the episode we theorists have been waiting for!!
This is the closest I'll ever be to being invested in a sports style bracket where the underdog wins.
Us Texans are coke
soda
Mattpat is being controlled by aliens
Kroger I know that company which they eat peoples heads
NO! WHY MAT PAT WHY
:O MatPat quitting Diet Coke? This is a sign of the end times...  Brb buying a fallout shelter
D: brus. im norwegain
Food Lion is in more states than just North Carolina.
At 6:07 steph was actually right Florida is just in a league of its own
I'm not sure this is matpat
Ummm who are you and what did you do to mat pat
Imma a coke/soda i dont clasify cola as soda for me soda is clear and coke is that brown color
Coke Zero
this is why you roll dice instead of rock paper scissors
D: Softdrink And I never heard of any of these stores, I'm not surprised thouh, as I don't even live in America
13:30
MatPat just gave up hope of getting sponsored
Me, seeing the title and getting excited that Matt is addressing the issues with aspartame and dumping diet drinks: FINALLY!! Me about a minute in: Oh. 0-0  Edit: OKAY HE DID MENTION IT AT 10:25--which I really appreciate! Don't drink stuff that uses it please people!
In Australia, we got fizzy drink
soda
*now for our sponsor, Harris Teeter*
13:31 put it at 0.25
Did anybody else have some static or something throughout the video? Knowing matpat it could be an ARG thing or it could just be a weird YouTube conversion mishap
Soda
Harris Teeter just became a anime mc from out of nowhere
Bro, let us buy Harris Teeter.
FTlive?
Yeah I can’t even bother with diet cola because the aspartame gives me headaches. For me it was classic coke in a glass bottle(it has pure cane sugar) for the longest time, until I found this smaller one from san antonio called Texa-cola. It’s like coke mixed with lemonade but it is addictive af.
13:30 weird visual glitch
Coco-Cola Battle Royale
Other
I call the soda what it is. So... D:other
17:16 i never watched it lol       ikr sad ;(
3:45 I CAN'T be the only one who hears it... (P word?)
It depends completely on what mood im in, but its usually 'soda'
Coke
I'm not sure where I learned this... It might have been in a contracts or marketing class at the art institute....  But I remember leaning about getting your product into grocery stores. And one of the things they sometimes do is require that you let them sell a portion of your product as the genetic store brand.
Coke
When I saw the title I literally gasped-
I can confirm that Kroger brand is also Fred Meyer brand. I'm pretty sure Fred Meyer just labels it Kroger brand too.
I never trust anyone who drinks diet Coke to have great taste........
We use to have a food lion but it went under like 10 years ago
Time to head to my local Ralph’s and see what they got :D
Dr Pepper not diet
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
15:29  D - other  we called them 'soft drinks' 'coke' meant only Coca-Cola 'Soda' referred to club soda/carbonated water/seltzer
"you guys down here in the south are just chaotic" as a florida man i have dealt with multiple meth gators, so yes.
You drink a lot of soda u til you are drinking 8L (yes, EIGHT LITERS) a day. (yes, A DAY) For those of you wondering. 8L is four of those big bottles.  So my friend drank 8L of coke a day. And burned a hole in his liver.
Here in Mexico they also sell coke (and sodas in general) in glass bottles, does this happen in other countries? I´ve never seen someone from the us drinking a soda from a glass bottle.
just like the food wars tournament arc
Pretty sure everyone knows Florida is it’s own part of the US, so she’s right to not include it as part of the southeast 😆😆
Come on, Harris Teeter, give him the sponsorship. He said you are better than Diet Coke.
13:31, does anyone else sees it?
Love the publix cameo
This isn't Matpat, it can't be. He's been rather quiet since the Security Breach trailer, and now he's quitting Diet Coke? (Well, he still has the cringey dad jokes)
I’m from the Midwest, we call it pop
15:30 Here in New Zealand, its all “fizz” or “fizzy drink” because of the bubbles
I think the taste could be more clear for each round if you cleaned the tongue after each round... I have a feeling that there could be some lingering flavor overlapping each other after the 5th sip.
If you're thirsty drink water. If you want sugar, eat something or have some sugar to get you through a period where you must work. Non-calorie sweeteners make you want to eat more because they activate digestion, fooling your body into attempting to digest nothing, which increases hunger.
Whats the 4th channel gonna be, i realize each of your channel has a different light on, so theres game, food, film, so is it ##### but hey thats just a theory a comment theory
I guess they can’t DUKE it out this year (for y’all who don’t watch sports Duke didn’t make it for the first time in a LONGGGGG time)
I call BS on this
NOOOO! Just ... DESTROY my childhood! I've loved your Diet Coke obsession for YEARS ... and ... now ... 😭😭😭😭😭  (🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣)
The ultimate diet drink: Water
Diet... ew... I don't like diet/zero sugar ANYTHING. I don't even like Coke. It's regular Pepsi for me 100% hands down every time. And fountain soda is the most water down garbage ever. And Pepsi always tastes better from bottle then can.
Northeast US: Soda Southeast US: Coke Midwest US: Pop England: Fizzily Spizzily Pip Pop Juice
Soda my guy
Soda
A carbonated, sugar beverage that is typically colored brown will always be referred to as "soda." Saying "pop" is wild in my opinion
yes you gave up diet coke for a video.
C O K E O R N O C O K E?
13:30 I was so scared something was breaking in my phone ;-;
Have you ever tried CEDEVITA . You need to try it
I defenetly call it soda
Normal coke
*BLASPHEMY*
Man you guys are close! To have a RPS round last 6 rounds! That’s somethin
Soda/coke
I have no clue what it means there are multiple flashes of images throughout the video
Soda Pop! But really I use them all interchangeably.
U wot
I grew up in Chicago, so you think I call it pop right? Nope, called it soda my entire life, no idea why. My family doesn’t, my friends don’t, but I do.
Les go NC!!!!!
there are no kroger affiliated stores anywhere near me :(
This episode was the plot of every sports movie
I'm pretty sure Edd Gould would be smiling rn
Another great vid! In my opinion i really like these blog videos on the channel and I hope I can see a bit more!
Hello Internet, Welcome to Food Theory, where today I’ll be curing my Diet Coke addiction and starting a new soda addiction.
did anyone else notice those strange bar cuts during the video, i didnt look into it but something about that seemed to catch my attention
Pretty impressive considering Diet Coke had the edge (being a fountain version vs. bottled) I wonder if it would have made the Final 4 if it was the plastic bottle version or can version like the rest.
Where is the diet cola Faygo?
This may be hard for you, matpat but, diet a scam. And is actually bad for you.
why do people call it soda, that's so wierd, just call it soft drinks
Just as I'm starting to give diet coke a chance! Although, I'm still more of a Dr. Pepper guy
suggestion cucumber sprite
I've got a food theory for you: Diet sodas are actually worse for you than regular ones owing to the artificial sweeteners triggering your body into producing more insulin, thereby increasing your cravings for sugar, which can either lead to overindulgence of the fake sweet, overindulgence of real sweet, or just having too much insulin in your body which can lead to hypoglycemia.  Note: This is legit just a theory I've heard. I haven't done a whole ton of research on the subject myself, but it does seem like it would make sense. I'd love to actually see an episode on the topic.
*extremely emotional*
waiting for food theory to culminate in some kind of citric acid avengers
A and B
Stevia is a taste you have to get used to due to it’s extreme sweetness. It’s almost like sour things, where you can’t consume too much of it or you will have an incredible sweet after taste.
Mat is definitely getting sponsored
Ok. but like every game theory fan is trying to solve the the puzzle from the video. or am I the only one who thing those weird flicking are code xd
What the heck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😮🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😮🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Diet drinks taste so bad
ex-frickin quese me?
You become what you swore to destroy
Who thinks food theory is the best! Answer: everyone
13:30   Somethings fishy here -.-
I use soda and pop. Not necessarily interchangeably, just depending on the circumstances.  If I'm in a restaurant, I'll order a soda but if I'm just with family or at a party or something, it's pop.  I'll say a soda can or soda bottle but can of pop or bottle of pop.  I'll also say some pop or a soda, but not some soda or a pop.  It's also completely unacceptable to call it soda pop.
*me who was never drank diet soda willingly ever* ._.
*I M  P O S S A B L E ! ! !*
I almost had a heartattack looking at this title. I thought Mat was going through one of those life stages where you cut your hair and change everything in your life and he decided to change diet coke
Welp, I’m never betting again
Also diet is worse for you than regular soda. The fake sugar is worse for ur thyroid and metabolism.
Have fun drinking "diet coke", no calories and all you lose is a #$*^ton of brain cells from the aspartame
I called soda but the rest of my family just called pop
Missing out on that Midwest Faygo, personally my favorite brand. I grew up hearing both Soda and Pop since I grew up in Wisconsin, but my dad is from Indiana.
We gonna ignore the flashes that are clearly something important every once in a while?
Coca cola from Peru
Diet Coke just lost their chance to sponsor him
You did an "objective" taste trial and your preconceived "favorite" was the fountain version... Fountain beats all other types by itself... Should have been can or bottles only.
Do this for Root Beer too!  There are Soooooo many kinds of rootbeer just at walmart!
Tbh I love coke
Honestly, i like all the Food Lion sodas
I know of food lion
i live in latin america and every time he said coke i thought it was coca cola, here we say cola to all which is pretty ironic considering my  previous confusion
There's a small independent soda company in my hometown in Pennsylvania called A-Treat, and they have their own diet cola. They're really popular here but sell nowhere else, I wonder how well it would stack up on an extended bracket.  They also have this radioactively-neon raspberry soda called A-Treat Big Blue. It makes a good doppelgänger for Nuka Cola Quantum, lol
how are they both sooo pretty :(((
How about you become a water main
so I can’t be the only one who hears the weird noise and the weird filter that appears for a frame multiple times, is this gonna be apart of a challenge or am I just over thinking it from watching too much theories?
I have tried every soda stream flavor and diet cola probably #6 in my favorites
Why are there so many glitch effects
2:48 We get it Mat Pat...
A: Pop. That's how we say it here in the Maritimes at least.   For anyone who doesn't know, I'm talking about the Maritime Provinces in Canada.
Obligatory Diet sodas are SO bad for you! (If sweetened with aspartame) I've had Boylan Cola and it has so much more flavor and character than regular Coke.
Food lion SLAPS
BETRAYAL???
Stay away from Mountain Dew Amp Original. Its like meth in a can.
Mat: "Was the battle of the south, Food Lion vs Harris Teeter"  Me, an intelectual, knowing Coke and Pepsi are from the south as well  The south is the king of Cola
I've been drinking the zevia for as long as I can remember
The math doesn't add up here
So what i learned is that I'm gonna start adding citric acid to my Coke Zero
Best run of Rock/Paper/Scissors EVAR! Of all time!
🅱️
I can confirm boylans other sodas are very good
Who are you and what have you done with Matpat.
Mat kinda looking 10 years older in the thumbnail
Root beer is better
21:53 My favorite part by far.
A pop
Ight. Gonna say this before I start watching the video. He won't actually quit Diet Coke. If he does, I'll complete Dark Souls 3 no hit no roll no run no weapon level 1 run blindfolded because it is clearly possible and I can clearly do it.
Mat, don’t go hating on my coke-a-cola life
B
Pop is how it goes here in Michigan.
its just an excuse for matpat to drink more diet coke
Comparing fountain diet coke against bottled and canned alternatives gave it a huge advantage, and it still lost.
xD mats addiction to diet coke is me but I drink a lot of mt dew
What was the glitch at 13:30
Try PiCs its northern
I love your videoes
D: in Ireland we call it fizzy drinks or just the name of the drink
Juice!! We don't call it soda 🤣
I did something similar with sprite, Sierra mist, and 7 up, cause my friends didn't vieve me when I said I could tell the difference.  Got it all right
Coughs in water
There are one or two Zevia drinks that are surprisingly really good, but the rest just have that overpowering, almost metallic kind of taste to them.  I can't remember which ones I loved, but I'm guessing the cola wasn't it.
We say cold drank in Louisiana
D: Hot coco
Being diabetic, I kinda am a diet soft drink aficionado.   Personally, I think that Diet Coke is bland, like flat type of flavour.   Diet Pepsi feels more Cola flavour is brought to the table, minus the sugar.
everyone gansta till matpat quits diet coke
Not only is Diet Coke nasty, but this man actually chose FOUNTAIN DIET COKE. Literal psycho.
Volgens mij is foodlion gewoon delhaize?
The end of an era and the beginning of something new.
Anyone else see the glitch at 13:30?
Try Sprite.
You know you’re lying
Me being mexican and not being able to get half these sodas🤠🔫
... ill m a k e you a soda. I will M A K E you a soda. I WILL MAKE HIM A SODA, i will make. You. A. Soda
am I the only one that calls them soft drinks?
So what you're saying is if I make something with citric acid, plus add some MSG, I basically have a license to print money?
Oh food lion isn’t in just Carolina it’s in West Virginia too  Edit:  But was there RC cola there
STOP THE CAP BRO
Midwesterner with a brain: Soda
Uh... Mat, You aight buddy?
Also i m from greece
I don’t even know why I’m watching this.. I don’t like soda.
Ooh this one's long *takes out diet coke flavored popcorn*
What about sunset sasparilla
I don’t understand why you never got a Diet Coke sponsorship! Like you have millions of followers across several channels and social media platforms. Why not throw a bone?🥺🥺 you did it for free as well
2:08 oh i thought he was going to say it's future's song
fountain is the most pure form of soda, canned and bottled are tainted
“Only ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke”
who new there would be a episode on diet coke
Um that glitch affect neer the beginning  might be important
Wow
soda if not speaking my first language
I’m pop because I live in Chicago so yeah
Welp, time to run to Kroger and try their diet cola
coke
this bad diet coke
ORRRRRRRRR... don't drink liquid garbage??? I know the struggle Pat it's delicious
Impossible
I was rooting for my favorite Coke Zero and in a way it won even if it was a tie so thats cool
SODDDDAAAAAAA
LETSS GOOOOOO, HERRIS TEETER FOR THE WIIIIIN.   YEAAAAAAAA
I’m coke cause ima bama boy
B: soda  but Stephanie is normally right
I love food lions cola. I live in VA and we have tons of food lions
Someone needs to get this man glass bottle diet coke. It's the best
Who’s gonna tell them that most citric acid is derived from corn
wait you live in north carolina!! what a lame state
A
Spoiler alert diet coke will btw that is a guess
I call it all Cola. Just feels right I guess? Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, see what I mean?
You need to try adding a drop of citric acid to Diet coke and Coke Zero to see if makes it beat harris teeter.
ice tea all the way forever
We call it soda
Soda soda soda soda !!!!
Woo! If only muffin soda was a thing ;)
Oh dang I got the notification that MatPat gave up Diet Coke 👀👀👀 And I was like ohhhhhh snap
Matpat just casually promoting random grocery stores..
D. I call it soda pop
I already quite coke in general
A
The gradual descent into a click bait youtuber
Food lion bops tbh
I saw the title and cried
wow u quit it realy is 2021
Soda
Born in Diet Coke. Baptized under Harris Teeter.
I say all of them depending on what they say.
Me when I read the title IMPOSSIBLE
Other cause... french. It's "boisson gazeuse" so "sparkling drink" as a direct traduction.
it’s definitely pop
I live next to a Harris Teeter, and I’m not a big fan of diet soda, but maybe I’ll check it out.
5:30 if fountain drink didn't win we have many questions
noooooooooooooo matpat quit diet coke (also pop #1)
I say soda, not pop or coke
wow
join the dark side and try L&P
A
From the UK - I call it Fizzy
As someone else who consumes entirely too much Diet Coke, I drank Sam's as a replacement for a few years but the flavor and carbonation were inconsistent between batches. I'd be willing to try a different store brand (especially since I've had a few bad batches of Diet Coke lately, but that might be due to temporary bottling plant sourcing/changes), but I'm not confident I wouldn't run into the same issue. For some reason, citrus-based sodas (lemon/lime, grapefruit, orange) seem to be more consistent.
Because the big chains tend to overload the sugar in their products, I find myself oftentimes preferring the lesser syrup added for cost savings in the store brands. It actually has a better balance to the oversweetened national brands.   Just my thoughts.
Wolf Cola.
A
As Diet Coke sales drop 90%
"I quit diet coke" - MatPat   *actually, quantum mechanics forbids this*
You know that they are really supposed to be married when they choose the same six times in rock paper scisors
Of course these are your local bottled sodas, including the Coke branded ones... while the syrup for a particular brand is usually the same everywhere there are regional variations due to the water the bottling plants use.  In theory its all filtered using similar equipment and the same everywhere but there are always variations in water quality.  There are likely subtle but noticeable differences between Florida bottled Coke and New York bottled Coke.  https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/bottling-operations-return-to-local-partners
Dr pepper: you want taste
This is impossible 😧
Soda
D I called it "fizzy drink" for the whole of my childhood     Let me know If anyone else did or am i just weird
Who are you and what have you done with MatPat?
I never thought I would see Harris Teeter in a video
When I read the title I thought impossible but let’s see
Almost stealing Eugene's gig 😂
B
He actually empties them out and puts diet coke in them
Honestly, we call sodas “soft drinks” in the South, at least where I am. I don’t usually here ppl call every drink coke lol
I’ve always just said diet but being from SC I’ve said coke as well
I can’t drink Diet Soda mostly because of the aspartame or sucralose usually gives me a major headache.  I call it “Soda”, but the rest of my family call it “Pop”.
I only drink diet coke so coke I guess
Mat is married to Steph. My name is Mat and I have a sister named Steph. Kinda funny.  I sincerely hope that doesn't mean anything unpleasant or weird.
L8 is amazing diet a d non diet its a shame only us in Kentucky get it
Hey can you do a bracket for fruit flavored sodas and have cheer wine In it
I live in southern va and harris teeter is our favorite grocery store.
Wait, if citric acid is the key ingredient to make stuff taste better, then perhaps it's the key ingredient in the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?
I got excited he was quitting until he said he just wanted to replace it with another soda. MAT PAT. ALL SODA IS GROSS. DRINK WATER PLS
18:20 - 19:00 This is some serious same brain energy going on here.
Good job
Pop
Did ya now that food lion is a sister company of Belgium: Delhaize
I'm a POP kinda guy
I used to only drink coke... Like I didn't drink water... Then I had a really bad cold or flu a couple years ago... I couldn't really eat anything for a couple days.... And ended up drinking some ice water... Which I had really only ever done when I had a hangover... And then at some point coke started tasting like cough syrup... Haven't had coke or any other soda since....  Weird side effect is I sometimes struggle to get enough calories causing more headaches...
Betrayal
Why does the video keep glitching.... glitchtrap...
Why diet cola? It tends to always be less healthy than the normal...
Man Mat’s really gonna make me go get Harris teeter soda now isnt he
You change my coat right hand till the day I die interview cuz I will never see you ever ever see you change the type I want to go and sing and I already even think
So this is the new nectar of the gods
So many years of worshipping diet coke just to realize it was 3rd place in taste
Aspartame is 10000% worse for you than sugar, Matt! You really should be drinking a soda with sugar in it.
I’m more of an other one
There were two 7th seeded colas. Oops?
• Pop • Soda • Sodapop • Coke   I’m from Missouri and we use All of the Above.
I bet everyone who saw the thumbnail thought "Dear God"
Matt and Steph then proceeded to go to the bathroom 5 teams each within the next hour
Me, living in Germany and never having heard of most of these brands: interesting
Coke
I’m a D I call it fizz
Bottled water always tastes like plastic, bleh
Regular Coke(baring allergies etc.) Not that it's 'good' for you, but it healthier that any diet soda. If only slightly. If you find a source outside the U.S. healthier and infinitely more delicious.
Never have I thought that matt would put as much effort into picking a Diet Coke as he does in his game theory’s
I’m watching at 1.5 speed so it’s like you had all the sugar or caffeine or whatever Diet Coke doesn’t have
18:05 10th seed* not 13th
So this is it?, the the first sign of the Apocalypse... Mat stop drinking diet coke. Be ready for the truth.
I've tasted 14 of these 16 cokes and my favorite is Coke Zero
Mmmm
MatPat + Diet Coke forever
I really like cola flavored Zevia!
Hey, is it just my phone, or are there these tiny glitches in the video?
We have a new name for philza when he looses shaftza
I call it "sodapop"
Hmm better try the Ralph's thats litterally across the street
Zero Coke
I'm team "pop," grew up in BC, Canada. My husband is team "everything is coke," grew up in Newfoundland, Canada. Pretty much nobody in Canada just says soda but you might hear "soda pop."
we actually have food lion’s pretty prominently here in VA as well
cant believe its not diet coke
Diet Coke Stonks:📉📉📉📉📉📉📉 Harris Teeter Stonks:📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
I bet matpat will never do the episode where he delves into the science of why diet sodas are actually less healthier.
i love that intro
Soda>Pop, Coke, Other
My cousin husband works for coca cola and they have a baby
THIS IS A DRINK THEORY NOT A FOOD THEORY you should make something called drink theory though
Did anyone else notice the weird glitches? One at 13:30, one earlier and I'll edit this if I see any later
They were trying to get everyone in my class to sigh up for march madness today, I left and went to the library...
B
Is it just me or the video kinda glitches out sometimes?
Is it regular fountain or Coca-Cola freestyle fountain?
Thank you for explaining March Madness, I had no idea what it was. I'm not really familiar with sportsball
Wow. Mat over there being unbiased and Steph picking her biased choice. Smh 😔
B: soda(WI)
Grass soda
drink water
my mom always just called it teeth begone
It's SODA and I can prove it. Grab a Sprite bottle and read the label. It says 'Lemon-Lime Soda'. If Coca-Cola Company officially licenses their drinks as 'soda' then that is all you need and I grew up in Florida.
13:31 I think the video corrupted or something there happened
Not as good as Big8
He never did get that diet coke sponsorship 😔
I'm from Oklahoma, and I've heard every variation of the word. I personally use soda, but there are restaurants that label them as coke, and the Route 66 "Pops" station that sells soda of every flavor. Including bacon. And communism.
Even Matt admits that Pepsi is a coke ripoff
Whats with the random static at 13:31 i feel like mathew wants us to figure out his theory just like markiplier except this is going to be a lot harder to figure out. But thats just a theory
I never thought I'd see the day
The fact that Matt and Steph were able to guess the canned, bottled, and Fountain Diet Cokes correctly is both really cool and extremely disturbing.
i call it soda
I like to call it pop
Just noticed pp&j banana dancing in the back of the intro
me seeing the title: matpat is out of his mind
Cherry Dr. Pepper
Coca Cola: *ignores MatPat and doesn't sponsor him* Harris Teeter: *slides into MatPat's dms* 😮👉👈😙😚☺
Q cola from Coles here in Australia is a great alternative to coke Zero :)
Oh, I thought this was gonna be about how diet soda isn't actually better for you unless you're diabetic
We call it fizzy drink in Australia.
Out of all the flavors here, his wife tastes the best
#notsponsoredbydietcoke
🤕
WAIT NO JARRITO
I'm a soda, I don't like saying pop. I'm also from the midwest.
I am very disappointed that you put fountain as the best coke... how?? It tastes like water!
I drink Zevia and I think it’s super good, especially the root beer
So what, you switched to coffee for 2020? Because nobody should go cold turkey off of caffeine, but even if you ween off, you'll always miss your caffeine fix as an American. Also you're both wrong; go with Diet Mt. Dew, you heathens.
The joke is off, then. The end of an era...
Unironically my favorite episode of the year.  ... mostly because Im also a diet soda addict.  Also I live in a place where all soda is commonly called coke... and i hate that so I call it soda. >_>
This is clickbait???
D: other here in Québec Canada we call it "liqueur". And in restaurant they just ask if you want to drink something. Kinda lame...
Soda
I am watching this as I drink a 2 liter Coca-Cola
I'm a soda man myself, although in my younger years I was more of a coke child. I think I grew out of it when I found out a certain illegal narcotic of the same name exists and that I'm deathly allergic to said narcotic.
Other: drinkie-drink
ROOT BEER FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!
You know you drink too much soda when you could guess properly which soda came from which in the first round. I drink root beer, probably either as much or more as Matt. Two liters are typically more bubbly when you pour them into a cup, machine poured (like at McDonalds) are typically darker in color and sweeter, while canned soda is typically not as dark or bubbly as the other kinds.
Matt: sorry Coke I'm  Breaking up with you Diet Coke: wait....what? Matt: OK I'm Stocking you eh... Diet coke: WAIT EXCUSE ME? Matt: OVERstocking you As In Buying Alot  of you anyway HEY TESTER COME AND GET IT this GAME theorist wants to test YoU  Lol did I just write a fan fic Lmao I'd.. Totally do that though BUT not any MORE hey TEster! Come And GET IT!
her face needs to be immortalized at this time stamp 20:46
How have I only just found out food lion is from North Carolina
Diet Shasta/Faygo wins for me for non-aspartame + pricing. Together this makes it a win.
I call it steak, like my favorite steak is cherry dr pepper
Now MatPat needs to do a food theory on citric acid.
WHAT A WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm other: I call them fizzy drinks.
Steph is smart lol... Coke Zero > Diet Coke every day of the week
Coke
Well, I'm non-English, but we were taught in English class to call it Soda.
Ah yes, an off brand, a perfect weapon against Uncle Samsonite.
BLASPHEMY!
Anyone else wondering where they got so much Foundation Diet Coke?  Nevermind, Mat probably has a Coke fountain in his house. 😂😂😂
Which alien replaced diet Coke matpat with non diet Coke matpat
Nice
Diet sodas are terrible. I was squirting a ton of MIO and Kool Aid into my water and got terrible stomach issues as it robs you of healthy bacterial gut. Plus cancer issues are a HIGH possibility.
Diet coke, is horrible, its actully discusting
Where is the fountain dt. coke from?  If it's not McDonald's forget about it!
Diet pepsi
Water
We call it all coke  So for me it’s c
Drink Pepsi Max. It is the good stuff.  Do it.
There's a glitchy thing going on at 13:31 why?
I say soda not pop or coke
B.Soda
Soda
I invested in a soda streamer so I make my own sodas now lol
Food lion is also in va and md
Who are you and what have you done with matpat
When did they move to NC? Also never underestimate the south's ability to throwdown in the kitchen
You made me thirsty...
We just call everything coke down in the state of yee haw
Anyone else notice a static thingy at some point between 4:05 and 4:06? Cause they have done secret messages before but i cant pause at the right time to check, but I went back a couple times and it kept happening at the same point.
I quit Diet Coke is click bate of this channel and it worked
literally quits diet coke and says about it: "CONTENT"
*sees Video pop up in Notifications* MatPat is finally fed up with not being Sponsored by Coca Cola?
random green lines go burr
When I see a coke life can I think of that one time I cut the can and put a plant inside of the can and gave to her for Mother’s Day
Me: literally drinking diet coke
D- other. Growing up we always specified what we wanted. Otherwise we called it a fountain drink.
I grew up with POP
Like ya cut G *Smacks the back of yer head*
Coke
Cake & Pepsi taste the same
Reminds me how i LOVE Pepsi like because of that little fruity flavor
c
I have no taste buds... i literally cannot taste the difference between ANY diet cola brand
Never thought he would do anything like this during his life
Pop
The krabby patty secret ingredient is                        Citric acid
I thought I knew you Matpat...
Matpat is so amazing that within 2 hours he go more than 30k likes.
I just knew he would like harries teeter since he says he likes the fruit flavor, he says the same with wine as well making him like fruit flavored sodas it was simple to see his decision
tennesse, i say soda
"Can I get Pepsi"  "We don't have Pepsi, is coke ok?"  "I'll take a gram"
food lion is down here in south carolina too mat!
CRYSTAL PEPSIIIIIIIIII, me loves crystal pepsi
There are people who have never heard of Food Lion?! Does not compute...
The end of an era...
I don't where sprite Gatorade and decrease on I drink so much Gatorade sometimes I end up having to go to the bathroom but you wanna go we'll bit and it constantly feels like you have to go to peons painful so basically being constipated but pie
i like Stephanie's hair it looks good
Just realized that Theories are never going to have Diet Coke MatPat addiction memes anymore.... Rest in Peace
I love your fnaf videos sooooo much. And your other videos, great job :)
what do you call flavored carbonated liquids? B) Soda
Cool video!
Easy. Coke Zero.  I know it's pure poison but giving up sugar soda lost me 85lbs & lowered my A1C.  Working on getting off insulin.  Not really ready to give up soda yet.
7-UP
You live in NC!?3:24
Pre-Diabetes is very disappointed in you Matthew
Pop. Here in Alberta 🇨🇦
I say "pop". Michigan is one of the few that actually calls it "pop".
I read the thumbnail and promptly gasped before exclaiming, "Never," so strong is my association with you and diet coke.  Time to watch the video and reexamine my world view
Honestly I didn’t even know Food lion and Harris Teeter were a northern thing
we call it 'fizz' in NZ if u want a universal name for all carbonated stuff
theres a troll face in this video, find it.
A:POP, I grew up like an hour away from where Matt pat grew up so yeah. OHIO Is pop country
I have a Fred Meyer nearby. Does anybody know the possible Harris-Teeter clones at Freddy's?
Pop
Mat PAt and Stepahnie are so in tunes it sickens me,. It's so sweet.
does anyone know what that green line is that flashes across the screen every once in awhile?
Plot Twist :  This video was sponsored
Me seeing the title and thumbnail: NOOOOOOOOOO
Don't like diet cola. But Boylans root beer is really good
I'm from the south so I grew up saying Coke. Now I say Soda because I used to travel a lot and people would be so confused lol
Matt Pat hates for fnaf But like he needs a break kind away
This is actually MatPats cry for help
As someone who use to work at a Kroger in my home town, I can say the store brand cola was super popular with those who tried it.
Boylan Creme is the GOAT though, let's be real
R.I.P. Diet Coke
YOOOOOO! Mat pat stopped drinking his favorite soda!  Also, might i suggest coke zero suger? Oh wait. . .
That rock paper scissors though... Insert Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme.
where is the real matpat, what have u done with him
Who was surprised NC is epic.
d
There's a food lion here in Virginia
Pov: me finally being proud that I’m not the only one in North Carolina who is insanely addicted to Diet Coke.
This is the end of the worl
definitely know of food lion but im 43 and they were big pre internet lol and also we're all 3 here in sw va people call it soda or pop or soda pop or coke or cola we ain't picky our mamaw used to call it soda dope because she was born late 1800s/early 1900s and it still had cocaine in it at the time
Where I am I call soda or pop soda water 🤔
They are too fluffing Cute for each other honestly. I love watching these two making content together
Soda is definitely the best, pop is understandably, but calling all soda coke? that is just weird.
I got jebaited 2 times unintentionally the first was the thumbnail because I just interpreted it as I quit youtube (my brain didn't d the right connections ) then I saw the title but it was cut off so I just said "I quit diet"  and I was like hmm ok weird I don't know why he did a video about that  but besides that great video
Try sprite
OMG its Matt he's in a theory video OMG.            Only Gtlive people will know the real matt
🖤
Mat: diet coke is number 2 Steph: *Pikachu face.
RC
I'm waiting for an episode about aspartame
I'm floridian and i gotta say having coke be a universal term is not a generic southern thing. Everyone i know says Soda. Pop just sounds wrong.
POP
Wait, people *STILL* say pop? That’s hilarious, America still uses old terms. Not even joking, my grandparents use the term “pop”, everyone I know usually say fizzy drink.
My dad used to say Diet Coke made you go crazy and i wouldn’t believe it if I never watched game theory😂
This is impossible. How could this be?
Okay... what’s up with the green flashes? Is there ARG stuff going on again?   I’m on mobile, so I don’t know how to do more than pause but the flashes have my theory brain tickling...
I am both. Soda pop
lol zevia is like one of the only sodas my dad let me drink
Best clickbait ever :P
Wisconsin man here, it's soda. Fight me
Plot Twist, he quit Diet Coke regular Coke
Wow, Aspartame, no surprising
Boylan is great with others
Boylan uses cane sugar in their drinks, which can be a bit of an experience if you're not used to it.
13:31 does anyone else see the glitch. This is not the first one either there was one at the beginning as well. I’m guessing it has something to do with something later on in the video.
You haven’t tried the 17p cola from Tesco
Food theory was such I good idea I’m so invested in this channel I’m so disappointed when I finish a new food theory video and there’s not another one to watch 😭😭
So, Kroke?
I relate, Matt, except my loyalty lies with regular Pepsi. Pepsi Zero, not to be trusted cos it tastes like flat diet Pepsi
As a member on the south and North Carolina. No it’s never been coke it is, always has been, and continue to be  B. Soda
How can you use cane sugar and still be 0 calories?
Oh no!
Wow i beber expected this hu
I’m in the Midwest and definitely it is said as pop occasionally soda
GHASP!
To me, Coke Zero is like New Coke, which was like Pepsi—sweeter, less carbonation, therefore easier to guzzle.
Zevia is the only soda my mom would buy for me, ha now I can drink all the Coke I want... not that diet crap btw
When I saw the thumbnail I was like no..no no no no no yo can’t do that, that illegal....               No
Where I live we call it pop
Its pop Soda is something you bake with and coke is a type of pop...just sayin
My answer is A. Pop
I feel like this channel is just an excuse to eat food and drink beverages.
I've heard of food lion
Where have we go e a channel that theorizes for games stupid details a channel that says that i mugman can curve universe and can beat all marval heros a channel that looks in a movie for a colonel sandars movie for citros a channel that god knows what is going to be about and in the root in this stands a happy family and a diet Coke addict. Sory for crying its Just beutiful  BTW i like your new haircut
Soda
WOW I'm So surprised Edit I live near north Carolina lol i just realized
If you slow it down at about 4:06 you can see something flash on the screen. I dont know if it was a mistake but knowing Matpat it could be intentional, perhaps linking to future games he's making. If anyone  goes deeper into this and tries to disypher this, let me know. Edit: I've kept watching and there is another more obvious one at 8:09. Edit 2: another one at 13:30, I am now fairly sure it's not a mistake, we need to start looking into this theorists. Edit 3: This is certainly me spiraling in the wrong direction but at 16:40 Mat says that he's shocked and a lightning/shock effect appears. The flashes of light earlier could have been a sign to look closer into these types of things. Just a thought. Edit 4: Another flash at 22:52. Edit 5: Someone pointed out to me that there is also one at 9:42. Edit 6: One at 3:03, someone mentioned they think it's the camera bugging out but idk, it's happening on segments that don't even use the camera. Edit 7: The other possibility is that YouTube is bugging which would be a bit disappointing. Even if we don't immediately find anything I think we should keep looking into it. Edit 8: video time between mobile and PC differ, so take all of these times with a grain of salt as it could be seconds earlier or later depending on what you're using. Edit 9: There are some weirdly capitalized letters in the description, I am 80% sure this is just Mat being weird but you never know. Edit 10: This will most likely be the last edit. I have come to realise that unfortunately, the overwhelming most likely possibility is that YouTube us just glitchy with new videos right now for some reason. Although it appears as if our efforts were in vain, I'd like to thank all the theorists who partook in this theory. As we all know not all theories end up making it. After all they're just theories. Matpat theories. Thanks for reading.
Soda
Also, I call tell you right now, the Kroger brand that is likely the one most similar to Harris-Teeter that Matt loves so much is likely Big K, which is what we had in Kentucky, and there were a lot of people who LOVED Big K over the national brands.
well considering Pepsi was created in North Carolina, in Food Lion vs Diet Pepsi, NC kind of defeated itself
Imagine being so good you get disqualified because you're too good. This post was made by the Dr pepper gang  (I'm soda by the way)
Coke gang
I don't know if it's the same as Harris Teeter but Fred Meyer (also a Kroger subsidiary)'s Big K Diet Cola has citric acid in it so theorists in the Pacific NW could try it out  Edit: Haven't tried Big K/Harris Teeter, but I agree with Steph that Coke Zero is superior to Diet Coke
I was today years old when I learned that America has food lion, and that its called food lion because here in Europe they are called delhaize
THIS EPISODE IS REVOLUTIONARY
You should use spa water with is fruit infused water and then you can use carbonation machine
A
Your food lion brand had the very same label as our Hannaford brand. I wonder if it's the same recipes? Hmmm
Fountain drinks are always better. Providing the machine is calibrated.
Is afri-cola a thing in US? My Favorite Coke over in germany
Team tonic sound off!
That’s a food fact
The rock paper scissors truly proves that Matt and Steph are soulmates
This blew my mind...love it
It's okay to call it "Soda" or to call it "Pop" but unless you are a child please don't call it "Soda Pop" :D
Nice try Matpat’s animatronic clone I know Matpat would never do that
gen-x native born californian, i call it "coke". my grandmother (from north dakota) and my grandfather (from georgia) also both called it a "coke". my dad, (also from california) calls it a "soda". i'm not sure how he became the oddball.
Boylans root beer is good
We have tons of food lions in VA
What makes this show so much better that game and film theory is that I know about every single item of food that he talks about.
I am so excited for March madness taping it right know
b
All Texans watching this: "Wait until you taste HEB diet cola y´all".
Whats going to happen to the diet coke jokes!
I call it a fizzy drink I’m English
Me **sees MadPats Title** Press X for doubt
I for one love coke zero and I also recommend it matpat
While entertaining I was disappointed this video didn't go in the more scientific side of things. I drink a lot of Coke Zero, so it would be nice to know how healthy they are. I know they aren't good for you, but as long as they don't give me cancer or kidney disease I'm fine with it.
the question is how much can you drink of it before you get sick of the taste. also the plastic bottle of Harris Teeter is a big disadvantage.
North Carolina? MatPat, I live way closer to you than I thought! Ever in Norfolk VA, come to McDonald's and I might see you! Would love to be in an episode one day!
All other episodes are about interesting or usable knowledge for us, but let's be honest, this episode is just for MatPat.
time to try smith's brand soda!
Theory idea: is cereal a soup?
fun Fact: Mat Donalds is the home of Big Mat burgers, which is currently competing with Big Mac. So what I think    MatPat hates: -Pure Cane Sugar,  and Stevia.
dr. pepper, I'm just saying.
This is a dark time in history.
I have not sen the video jet but i know he is Lying
Steph is dumb coke zero is bad
No impossible
*my last name being boylan*  Uuuh
rooting coke 0
13:31 is it a hidden secret
I watched this video and now I can’t stop getting coke commercials
Soda
Haris Teeter stocks are about to go through the roof
Hey Mr.punzys up this : Mat... Patness...
Coke crew, rise up Texas
I need one of these for Mountain Dew, most competitors have a hard time replicating the balance.
Im a soda
I'm from Ohio so it's pop here.  The local grocery for us is Kroger and when it comes down to it, my drink of choice is Big K Cola-Oh, Kroger's version of Pepsi or Coke Zero.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.... just right.
i like how this is an accuse for matthew to just drink a few last sips of diet coke
switch to pepsi max
Guys do you like Pepsi max?
I've had the stevia soda you're using... no go man... can't take it. Also, OMG THAT'S HILARIOUS. I totally prefer Kroger brand Diet Coke over Coke brand Diet Coke. Publix Diet Coke is horrible... sorry Publix...
A
The best soda ever is Dr.pepper Cream soda. Tots recommend
D : cocarina
Publix is the best part about Florida I swear, except their store brand sodas
Well, how about a new soda... Vernors, a spicy ginger ale
Now Matt can fight for that Harris Teeter sponsorship since Coke wouldn't do it
Chesco
We just call it a fizzy drink in my part of the uk. A lot of people say pop but we mostly just call it by name or group them as fizzy drink
I saw the title and said to myself impossible
I’m allergic to citrus... so yeah. I got to watch out for the better sodas :(
Press x to doubt
B
There only diet coke where I am
Wow! I didn't realize how much I wanted this episode! 💕💖💕
I don’t drink any soda at all
A
Everyone’s dream drinking different diet cola
MatPat: quits Diet Coke the Coca Cola company: "You cheater, I give the best years of my life"
Oh my god given two cokes he picked the store brand
Here in Australia I call it fizzy
Soda
B
As a sprite connoisseur I can confirm bottle sprite vs fountain sprite hits way different
FOOD LIONS STILL EXIST!? I remember having one down the road from me here in Florida that died off YEARS ago
In my country we call fizzy drinks wil..."drinks"😅 , i live in Libya and it's Islamic country 😄
Good.
I love coke zero
You know that you’ve found someone who thinks like you when you can go 6 ROUNDS OF ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS AND NOT HAVE A SINGLE WINNER.
MatPat you HAVE to do Diet Cola Faygo, I actually found ti tastes better than Diet Coke and I LOVE Diet Coke
Got a Pepsi ad right before this
Stevia only tastes weird because we're used to sugar.
The ediction was killing u
Matt Pat lives in North Carolina ?? Wow
theres a bunch of flashes on the screen almost like that one error screen or when something goes wrong in a live film and shows the rainbow..uh, bleped screen? i dont know how to describe it...
A
I will be going to my King Soopers (Kroger) and get one.  I am looking forward to drinking my new possibly favorite pop.
!greensnakeorange:
March Madness was BASKETBALL ALL THIS TIME?? 😬 I def thought it was football.  ...eh in my defense, I’m a Theater Kid
wait, you're telling me you have no diet coke in glass bottles?
I am more of a Dr. Pepper man my self.
Soda
Good god. Still doesn't realize that saccharin isn't all that great for you
Ive never been happier in my life to see a thumbnail. Coke is absolute garbage.
If you call it pop then just leave me alone
Channel idea: sport theory.
Here in Ukraine, we call most soda - Cola, as as far as my knowledge goes Cola was the first foreign soda to be sold in the Soviet Union
Food Lion is based off Delhaize/De Leuw, a huge Belgian supermarket chain. I lol'ed when I saw the logo.
Food Lion is in east TN too. There are a lot fewer than when I was a kid, but there is one 10 minutes from me.
C
Wow Mat didn’t include diet fizzy water, I see how it is, your gonna play this game? Fine
I am french so I grew up calling it coca or sodas in general
My name is Matt too, my birthday is tmrw!
I just wanted to say goodbye Diet Coke one of the longest living members of the channel
MatPat changes diet soda. One year later, Coca Cola files for bankruptcy
Another thing MatPat's famous for is ruining our childhood Movies
They have a Durian soda  https://yummybazaar.com/products/tomomasu-durian-cider-10-oz-300ml
Boylan soda tastes weird because modern soda has a ton of sugar and vanilla.
This is so sad can we hit 500,000 likes on this video
:O SAY IT AIN'T SO
Acidity shines in a sip test but smoothness and consistency will make a better drink overall. That’s why Pepsi wins sip tests but people still prefer come overall. That’s why Coke Zero is the best IMO.
Its Soda, but ive lived in pop places
(B) soda
Coke for both Pepsi and Coca-Cola, and soda for everything else
Why did you decide to stop diet soda
This is the first time I realized Publix wasn't a nationwide chain.
I love this story as a young warrior fights And manages by any means to become the new king                            Sun Tzu, the art of war
The world is coming close to turning point...how will this affect the world? Let us watch and see.
I actually didn't know you lived in NC. Charlotte pride!
MATPAT WHY?!
C’mon diet moxie is king
13:31 whats up with that colouring?
Honestly i can confirm that kroger has similar tastes to that what matpat described
Being in NC, it's funny hearing NC based stores on this channel. Like I can relate
I am so happy I live in North Carolina after seeing the results of this soda championship.
Yeah, get that aspertame out of your diet already.  Also, what are you doing saying what state you live in and the closest state specific.grocer to your house? You trying to narrow things down?
I’ve never clicked faster
Oh he's  diet guy I see I calling the fbi
Did anyone else feel like they were watching food wars the grand tournament the whole three way final and everything
A pop
How believable. He totally won't break this diet within the first week, if he even lasts the day.
Any one else notice the random flashes of random video glitches
Soda
lol harris teeter probs get 500 customers a day bc of matpat
I'll have a pop....
15:29 I'd have to choose A. I call all of it pop but I call it soda online because idk i guess it feels more universal than pop
you guys are champs in my books
I call them fizzy tongue stabs
It’s like a drug addict in rehab
Feeling Carolina proud! Woo
I LOVE THE FIET COLA FORM FOOD LION!! We loved 10 minutes away from it. It really was the best❤️❤️
Soda
Water.
I know he probably bought a large diet coke from McDonalds for the fountain one, but my head cannon is that he uses sponsorship money to stock a personal soda fountain with only diet coke.
Me: reads the title ..... Me: ITS HAPPENING PEOPLE THE MOST ANTICIPATED TOURNAMENT
Water wins
Down here in the chaotic south, it is ALL coke. Some folks may say they want a "regular coke" if they wanna be specific lol
I'm B
Georgia coke
No mat pat please don’t drink the stevia it’s poisoned with ricen
Random fun fact diet drinks are unhealthy
Pop is north east not Midwest. Here in the Midwest, it is B
Zevia is flavored with stevia pronounced st ev ia
You could compare the ingredients of the soda. This is the list for Big K diet cola: Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Phosphoric Acid, Aspartame*, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Citric Acid, Caffeine, Natural Flavor
I guess I'll have to try our generic soda at work to see if we have the new theory nectar
This wasnt a theory he just wanted to drink soda
De pepper is amazing
Isn’t diet actually worse than normal soda
"And Florida "  ouch I really felt that one 💔
Mat pat: i don’t really like it Also mat pat: *keeps drinking *
Oh this came out 2 hours ago! *Neato*
6:09 Me a Floridian: No no, she’s got a point
Another sign of the apocolapyse
D cause Australia calls it a fizzy drink
Man i got away from coffein but now i want a coke.
I am convinced marriage causes mind-to-mind communication.
Diet anything is poison.  Just like the cv shots, industry paid to get it past regulations.  Dumb people line up for an experimental jab
#bringbackthesuperamazingendcardtournament
2021
"you may never had heard of Food Lion" I have. But have you heard of Food Land?
B
Replace diet coke?, so then MatPat is going to divorce his wife
Yes
You forgot your faze but it's just a theory a game theory!
I'm impressed that the Food Lion and Publix sodas were pretty good. And I'm from Georgia.  I call most soft drinks sodas. And any cola-like sodas that aren't Coca-Cola I just call Off-brand Coke.
Yeah up here in the north mid-west we call it other. "Eh do yoo want any other eh?"
This was a fun one in general.
2021
Alternate Title: MatPat claims his addiction as a job expense
Mtw due
gotta admit the real life food theories are better
CRYSTAL PEPSI IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!! IT *NEEDS* TO COME BACK!!!

D:
I might be going insane but throughout the video i kept seeing green glitches  Is that just me?  13:28 as example
we're all playing casual coka cola but matpats playing competitive coke
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
2021
In Arkansas there is nothing that isn’t coke
am I the only one who saw sam's cola and instantly thought of pkrussl
Harris Teeter pulled out against all odds, which is cool!  Want another against all odds story? Go check out the hunger games simulator, and you get a simulation between YouTubers, including Matpat, Stephanie, and Austin from The Science, and many other Youtubers! Put in the code: GlbKBZAn in the load simulation area and have fun :3
i miss when he always wanted a sponsorship from diet coke 😔
MapPat  this is a theory for film theory but whatever, it’s about guardians of the galaxy volume 2  Yandoo (probably didn’t spell that right) didn’t have to die, when he flies quill up to the ship he gives quill the suit to put on so he can breathe but we know quill has a mask/helmet that he wears that lets him breathe even when out of the atmosphere of a planet, we have seen him use it before. He could wear that and breathe and yandoo could use the suit. Am I right or have I made a mistake please answer this question
Diet Coke also uses aspartame
Do an episode on the recipe to the Krabby Patty
In indiana we say pop.
Guys I know the next channel's name.... CITRIC ACID THEORY
I live next to a Kroger and they have a brand called Cola Oh and it has been my favorite for years.
This comes up in my recommended while I have a can of diet coke in hand
I love how connected mats and stephs brains are.
I grew up with Coke Zero
B
pop
Im pretty sure food lion aint american, correct me if im wrong but i think its belgian/french/european
Food lion is from NC? It used to all over tv in maryland during the late 2000's with its ads. I just thought it went out of business at some point since they aren't around here anymore
nice
I am living a healthy lifestyle now! I quit soda and now only drink Beer, energy drinks, and water. Wine on occasions and a lot of COFFEE. Healthy living! 😃
Pepsi Max /Pepsi Zero Sugar > Coke Zero > Diet Coke / Coke Light FOREVER
A
you’re in NC and no cheerwine? NOOOOOOO
The end of an era...
A all the way
Today is a sad day
I live in Wisconsin. I do not hear pop here in the Midwest, we call it soda.
Who are you and what did you do to mat
harris teeter stonks
I didn’t notice that Mat Pat lived in NC
I'm with Steph.  I'm from Kentucky.  It's all Coke to me.  Pepsi is Coke, and Coke is my preferred Coke.  We all understand what we mean.
I’m from the Midwest as well and I heard pop more som I’m team pop
I'm half French, half German, and in French we say Coca, and in German we say Cola, both for all of the cola brands.
pop
20:54 that face is gonna become a meme
soda
HEB can sugar cola is the GOAT of cola, even better than Coke. The only thing better than the can cola is their bottled can sugar cola
FITZ'S IS DA BEST  but diet rite is insane
You should have never started drinking diet coke in the first place it is worse then regular soda ... Just because it's diet doesn't mean it is good for
Usually videos clickbait me pretty women or outlandish titles. But when I heard that matpat was quiting diet soda, I had to click
me who was has been here since the first fnaf theory:   *wait that’s illegal.*
I’m from Huntersville, North Carolina (not too far from Charlotte) so when Food Lion had that upset I was so proud because I remember my local one from my childhood vividly!
ok then now you gotta make an episode where you buy a cola from every kroger owned store and test if they all taste the same
B. Soda. Everyone else around me said coke and I hated that confusion at restaurants. I think some of that came from the movie of “where the red fern grows”
Diet coke after this video:   *Not Stonks*
This isnt food theory anymore its “theorists eat/drink random things for content.
Soda here
13:31 WHAT THE WHAT NOW
Love the vid but for future competition vids like this,  it’s better to have odd number of judges.
No one I know says pop unless it’s in an ironic sense. We all say soda but usually we specify what kind
I saw the title and the universe started to fall apart.
Matt I think you accidentally posted this early, *it’s not April*
As someone who drinks Coke Zero and Pepsi max the way matpat used to drink Diet Coke I feel a change can make you like something more than if you are drinking it regularly. It’s cheaper for me to drink Coke Zero so anytime I get Pepsi max I feel like I enjoy it more but after a week or two I get bored and switch back to my usual and then feel like I enjoy my usual Coke Zero more when I return to it than before I switched to Pepsi max
Sody water
as a chicagoan, it's soda
Where is freeway Cola
So @cokecola lost out on an excellent opportunity 😂 they got wrecked by a store bought brand
No don’t leave diet coke
My family has just started working toward a candy business (specifically chocolate), and I think this is important information. My dad did always have interest in the citric acid (not in the chocolate, though; just different types of candies and stuff; you know, the fruit-flavored stuff).
what about glass bottle diet coke
That's so funny, so did I!  Well I quit all soda, but still!
Can confirm Big K diet cola (Kroger brand) does have citric acid included!! Looks like it may be the same as Harris Teeter.
What food lion isn't North Carolina based
I read that title and now I have to sell all my stock in Coca-Cola company before they go bankrupt.
Coke Zero is my favorite Diet Soda.
As a Zevia fan (most flavors) the first time you drink it, it's sweeter and a little bitter. After that you get used to it.
At Pick n Save we have Big K Diet Cola which, I’m pretty sure is another name for the soda you picked as your favorite.
FINALLY I was just sitting here waiting for the smart guy to realize the dumb thing he was doing...
I have no stores who carry’s the soda 😭
8:09-8:10 what was that green clash i should spread the iformation to Theorists™ so they can figure out what is the fourth channel
Once again this is the kind of content I subscribed for
Soda!!!
Harris Teeter cola, it was meant to be! Closest available soda, best flavor, etc!
Soda
it is 4:20
no this is the only reason I subbed to food theory because I though I was the only one who drinks diet coke
you gotta try the other zevias the one you tried is the only bad one
i am pop
I never thought I'd hear matpat say "garbage" and "diet coke" in the same sentence
Im with Stephanie Matt it should have been coke zero! (yes, I refuse to call it the new name)
Me reads title: WHAT!!! *jumps back*
Before I watch: I’ve been watching this channel long enough to know this is clickbait for fans
Dr Pepper is my faveroite
Hey Mat you may want to read the one study that is responsible for the banning of aspartame, basically the study used a methodology to try to prove a link between cancer and aspartame and even with a methodology that just shouldn't even be considered the results were still "inconclusive". Going over that study could even make a good Food Theory episode as it is a great example of how not to do a scientific study. Every study done since btw has shown 0 link between aspartame and cancer. Anyway just thought I'd recommend it to you.
15:15 As a midwesterner as well, it's soda. Then again, I'm in that corner of Wisconsin that says "bubbler." Wisconsin: What fun is there in making sense? Edit: I shop at Pick n' Save and/or Metro Market on the weekly. I'll look for the local "store brand" diet cola, and let you know if it's halfway decent.
In Missouri, you can get all sorts of names for soft drinks. My preference is soda.
I wanted Harris Teeter to win because it looked like drip...
Soda
A relatable video
Mat: Taste test tournament :D  Harris Teeter: Y'all mind if I just....squeeze on in hur? (eyes glow meme)
OMG Payless is our local grocery store on Guam!
We like to call it fizzy
My personal favorite soda is Jarritos, so I’d recommend that
Pop up here in the west coast
looks like he’s not getting that sponsorship
who are you and what did you do to Matpat???
Mom’s from southwest Ohio and grew up calling it pop, then went to grad school in D.C. and all her friends gave her grief for not calling it soda, so now my brothers and I (in southwest Ohio) were raised to call it soda
I call them Fizzy drinks
The rock-paper-scissors competition is just further proof that Matt and Steph share one brain
just drink water bro, soda is gross
I think this is an excuse to just try out different sodas
Great
Yo who needs a science teacher if you have these guys
I was hoping he would try cherwine. It's very common in nc
“Florida is part of the south east” _No_
Me: *reads title*  Also me: *Impossible.*
1:31  Too late, I’m a bit obsessed with Diet Coke 🧍
How about no soda its way healthier
Another thing people know Matt for is the link is dead theory
18:59 They're perfect for each other
The test had some unfairness since you chose the Diet Coke you liked the most and then chose the other sodas at random. It probably would have been more fair to take all of the sodas from a can.
I suggest you get Miranda is a morrocan soda
I’ve never been so proud or happy of living in North Carolina 😂
*you whAtT?!*
Me who lives in Florida and goes into Publix every 3 days
me and mattpat are the same, we talk about our fav drink, we drink it all the time, and we love the taste, the only difference is my drink is monster energy drink
It is usually called pop here in Ontario Canada but some people say soda.
C
Water
C
matpat needs to go to brazil and try guarana
Dad from the south, mom learned the queens english, somehow I got soda.  Also, the weird liquorice background of bottled dr. pepper does for me what the citrus is doing for you. A nice little taste of something you couldn't quite understand at first, but once you get it, it hits a weird spot in the back of your mind that just feels right.
Coke
I grew up in Tennessee and currently living in Georgia and I call it soda as do the rest of my family.
Went from POP to SODA
ive always been more of tea person
I grew up with the word soda
Get yourself someone who looks at you the way Steph looks at Mat
Mat: "I hate this soda"  Also Mat: *Keeps drinking the soda*
what happened to the screen at 13:31
I honestly thought you were quiting Diet Coke because you started developing kidney stones, please be careful with that, I'm glad to hear that you spent all 2020 without drinking it. Also, here in Mexico we call it both Soda and Coca (Coke)
Me: I WANT TO GO TO MATDONALDS Mom: we have mat Donald’s at home  Mat Donald’s at home: mc Donald’s 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
We are soda in Massachusetts
RE: aspartame  just because a lot of countries ban something, doesn't necessarily mean it is bad for you. i don't know whether it is or not myself. but just going off how many countries ban something as an indicator of healthiness is **really** unscientific.  and if it is only two "experts" calling for the ban, out of how many thousands of food safety experts that exist in the world, i would call that suspicious.  i am open to the idea that aspartame is actually bad for you, but i would want to see evidence from long term scientific studies on the topic, not just hear from two fringe experts.  as a sort of science communicator brand, i would expect you to do better.
He got a haircut :O
I'm a pop guy here in Canada
Just from the title I know you're depressed
I live in Aus, we call them soft drinks
NOOOOO MAT WHYYYY
Soda Gang Soda Gang
Where I live pop means dad (but I personally don't say that), soda means, well soda and coke means cocaine
My family said "Diet Coke is very unhealthy more than normal coke."
I live very close to a Kroger and can confirm it can be described as having a fruity after taste like the soda you described
I’m surprised with how in with science is Matt has not done something on the effects artificially sweetened (0 calorie) products have on your brains reward chemistry
There's a tiny indie brand I've never been able to find again and this video made me really miss it
"We at food theory do not support mass consumption of diet coke despite matt's inexplicable ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis" FOOD THEORY, MARCH 18, 2021
Coke Zero is my Jam.
The reason why the can coke tastes like plastic is because the use a plastic wrap to make it not taste like metal.
boutta go to kroger rn
Fun fact! Diet Coke isn’t just normal coke with aspartame, it’s actually a diet version of the failed new coke. Coke Zero is the original recipe plus aspartame.
In Canada, there's a store brand called President's Choice and their diet coke is disgusting. It tastes like medicine to me. My dad is diabetic but still likes soda so we get diet soda for our entire family but I always just try avoiding drinking the President's Choice stuff whenever it's on sale and my dad buys it
Dionysus is not happy with you
C: Coke and moving to TN from FL, i always got the drink I DIDNT want xD
My diet soda of choice is diet dr pepper
NooOoOoOoooooOooo
why are there wierd green and yellow frames inbetween?
YOU CANT REPLACE DIET COKE NOOOO.        I’m watching this before i saw the vid
MatPat should make a theory on Friday Night Funkin
C
thanks matpat and steph, you make my day just a little bit better.
Who are you and what did you do to matthew
This seems illegal to happen
Me, a dude from Germany: well, I think you should go with Fritz Cola!  (Ok that was a joke but if you ever visit Germany you should try Fritz Cola it tastes great. Also it is a German brand. [btw I think they have a non-calory version but I am not very sure])
By using the fountain diet coke your skewing the results.
Fountain often turns out sweeter as it gets mixed at a slightly different ratio and also usually gets slightly mixed with the previous drink served from the fountain which often be regular coke, lemonade, orange etc...
Reads the Title: Are you ok!?
Im BA
NOOOOO
Well no if I can get my family to do the same
Harris Teeter became god at the time this was made
Steph and I had the same face when Matt said he liked the other brand over Diet Coke😂
Anyone notice the green flashes on the screen?
Faygo died cola is fantastic
Ok
It’s good to see Steph in Food Theory. I got lowkey sad when she left GTlive
Coming from NC I can say food lion is underrated
my favorite root beer is a generic brand
Me sees title impossible
Dr Pepper is my faveroite
The secret crabby patty recipe is... citric acid
WHAT?!?!?
I’m a soda guy
I felt so gangster bc I know what food lion is. I live in South Carolina and there’s one in my town
my favorite drink is seltzer water you should try that
i am from vrigina the state right above north carline and i heard of  them i have one there diet cola food lion in my house
Faygo is just so good. So cheap, so many flavors. So dang good
Good for you
Soda
Food lion? I'm sorry but over here in Belgium we call it Delhaize
"No Mat! You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!"                                                 - Sun Tzu, the art of
water
My go to soda is Sprite.
Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete...
After Steph's exit from the livestreams, I'm going to be living for all future appearances in videos like this, she's so wonderful and they're such a great couple
Once I saw this title I clicked it insntly
where are my filipinos at who says "soft drinks"
If only Diet Coke would have sponsored him when they had the chance, all of this could have been avoided.
My homie glass bottle diet coke would've tasted way better than fountain
D: Other. We call it Soft Drink in the land down under 🦘
To think if Diet Coke was going to sponsor matpat till they saw this video of his betrayal 😅
Who else caught the glitch in the cam at 13:30
This is scarry
Instructions unclear: filling tub with Diet Coke gonna bathe in it then binge drink Shasta Cola til my gut bursts. Send help.
NO
:[]
hay uhmm mat what's with the green lines?
"I stopped drinking diet coke for a year" there is an imposter among us
Soda
I'm from the South, and it's pop. Case closed.
Coke Zero is the worst soda to ever be made, PERIODT.
I’m gonna guess that Harris Teeters  will gain some sales after this
As someone from Ohio I am 100% team pop
Every day we strive further from god
A
Always coke.
The world really is ending
NUU DONT QUIT DIET COAt
My favorite diet cola is h2o
I use to say pop when I was younger but now I say soda. Btw I’m from Illinois
i actually have a lot of memories at my local food lion, i live in delaware
Theory: the secret ingredient in the Crabby Patty is Citrus acid
Me drinking Diet Pepsi
This is probably the most effective thumbnail I’ve ever seen. I need to watch this.
Bro drink cola flavored Kabucha
As someone that worked at a food production facility... changing labels without altering the recipes used is a no go at least where i used to work ... each label has its own recipe... they can be very close (aka 1 or 2 grams of more sugar or citric acid for instance) but never the same per label.
When I worked for Sanderson Farms years back we packaged the same chicken for local brands. The chicken came from literally the same place. Absolutely nothing was different aside from the packaging.
Impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete
EVERYONE IN THE SOUTH SAYS THAT THEY USE "COKE" FOR EVERY SODA BUT EVERYONE I ' V E PERSONALLY BEEN AROUND JUST USES "SODA." THIS CONFUSES ME SO MUCH.
Mat pat make another chanel called Book theories chanel
Who would have thought that a small grocery store named Harris Teeter could have sponsored MatPat in 2021. What a world we live in.
That rock paper scissors mind-reading was like the most wholesome marital thing Ive seen on this show XD  6 times in a row and NOBODY wins! What ever ARE the scientific odds of that!?
In Australia it's called "soft drink" exclusively
Whats the song at 8:08 ?
9:36 who's the other guy with Steph?
Finally
Matpat try pakcola
D: Soda Pop  It may not help a lot in pokemon battles but it sure does exist
We say pop here in Minnesota.
Ok I’m gonna get Kroger Diet Cola and I’m gonna see if it’s like how you describe it
Boylan's creme soda is sooooo good, dont let Mat's reaction soil the entire company.
What kind of other do u want? Dr pepper
B.
Impossible..
Pop
Fountain soda is better than can or bottle cause its straight from the fountain
Definitely B
Someone's angry about not getting a sponsorship.
Why diet soda again? [edit: I grew up with the term "soda"]
Softdrink
It incredibly disappoints me that they went to the extent to try to be scientific, and yet at the beginning of each round they knew the options of which was which, and obviously seeing the clear one also spoiled that round.
13:50
In England we call them fizzy drinks
B
“Matpat: I quit Diet Coke” *pulls out dictionary* These words! Is it even possible to put them together in a sentence like that?!
RIP Coke, but not that coke
My sister worked at a place where they packaged deli meats etc into boxes (part time job when she studied) Sometimes they had to replace the labels. It was another brand on the label - but it was the same stuff in the packages. And i also heard from a guy who worked a condiments factory, they did the same.
Wait, Publix isn't in all of America?! oh no. my life is a lie
I wonder if matpat new favorite cola will be good with spice
Is this legal?
D other I’ve always loved calling them fizzys a habit that happened because of what I heard someone call it at an airport.
I’m going to be real. I think putting the fountain diet coke wasn’t the best option when putting them against a bunch of bottles and cans, simply because you aren’t going to be able to just buy other fountain colas aside from maybe diet Pepsi.
As a Cincinnati local, I am very proud.
Other. I always say "cola" when I want cola.
I still love hes taking his haters in stride. I always knew that sans is ness theoru was for fun
I recommend faygo faygo is very good and it has like a billion different flavors and they're all better than Shasta
Diet soda can actually be worse than regular soda
Am i the only one who call these "soft drinks"
Quit drinking coke and drink guaraná
Man that glitch at 4:06 scared me bad, but I’m betting it’s part of an arg or something
Wow
Can't wait to see the ads for diet coke: spring citrus, just so they can get the 80% of their company that they just lost.
Only real North Carolinians know what food lion is
Go Duke
Should've done a losers bracket
I’m a pop guy
It's actually "soft drink" ;)
I gave up DC for lent, I guess all soft drinks but DC is the only one that matters. Anyway, I needed this video lol
Matt drinks more diet coke than can be made at a time fite me
in the uk its fizzy drinks instead of pop or soda
Lemon ice tea?
I'm with Steph on the stevia and i think it messes with my anti depressants i drank the green pepsi for a bit had some issues
In Nigeria, everyone calls them mineral 😂😂
Fun fact: Diet soda is just as bad for you as regular soda. The ingredient they use to sub out the sugar is harmful to your body in a MASSIVE way! In my opinion you should just drink seltzer water.
MrBeast Once Bought Everything in Food Lion
Only OGs remember his coke addiction
Man, now I really want to try Harris Teeter's/Kroger's Rootbeer because I bet it's amazing. (I've done basically what MatPat's done with Rootbeer because I'm super picky about my Rootbeer for ice cream floats.)
anybody else turn on captions at 3:45 ish?
I am disappointed I grew up with matpat chugging diet coke This change will be hard to process
No
This episode proves that we in the south care about our soda.
I'm offended that HEB was not included on that end regional store list.
*laughs in water*
You should make conspiracy theory channel
But Diet Coke is like 80% of ur personality😫
Matpat Diet Coke MUKBANG?
If you hate caffeine head aces but still wanna taste good pop cane sugar pops are the way to go
man mat you need to do some research food line isn't nc based
I have food lion in Maryland
Well, now you have to do a Food Theory episode on Citric Acid.
coke is what I call soda or pop or soda pop
Funny that Steph and MatPat prefer fountain/soda tap but Rhett and Link prefer can (per their GMM Soda Bottle vs Can Taste Test). I’m a can girl myself as well. Fountain/tap really tastes watered down to me.
whaaaaaay
Living in North Carolina, I love that Sams, Harris Teeter, and Food Lion (my dads go to) are in here. Also, I'm a Soda kind of person.
coca cola cant stay true to the original recipe lol, cocaine bro
I haven’t watched the video but this seems like a tragic love story
Why diet diet drinks are discusting
as an overnight stocker for Fry's in AZ, the store brand soda, Big K., just doesnt compare well to the Pepsi sodas we carry in store
I choked on my tamale when I read the title
try flat diet coke that's still cold, its my favorite drink. ESPESIALY FROM MCDONALDS
I’ve never seen Pepsi 0 sugar. Only Coke 0 sugar
Before even watching. What treason is this? What dark force has compeled mat to stop drinking his favorite since the begining of the channel. Dark times indeed.
**sees title** HERESY!!!
Today I learned that Food Lion was North Carolina based. I see them everywhere in NC and I guess I assumed it was a big brand all over the states
I'm a Californian, so I say Soda.
ok
Mat’s entire character is fnaf and Diet Coke. If he actually ditches Diet Coke, he loses half his character.   Edit: ok this was made before I watched the vid and idk what to say
The underdog actually won! Woooooowww!
I'll miss diet coke :C
In California, it’s all coke. Not soda, not pop
Other: Here in Australia we call it soft drink for some weird reason.
3:44  lets get WHAT?
Is Food Lion really something people don't know about? I grew up in VA, and I thought Food Lion was, like, slightly less well known that Walmart and Target.
lol in england we call it coke or "fizzy drinks" i call it coke cuz im not weird
Coke coke coke coke coke coke coke coke coke!!! Coke coke, Sprite coke, orange coke, Pepsi coke, normal coke, grape coke. It all coke!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CORONA IS STILL A THING AND MATT QUIT DIET COKE   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH RUN
Henry's root beer or cream soda
Surprised that Mat didn't include the Soda Stream Diet Coke in the run-off
my prediction for winner: coke zero
I had Coca Cola Life once, and honestly I wish they'd replace all the other diet Coca Cola with it, because it tasted like normal cola. I don't like 90% of diet sodas. They just taste bad, and I feel like I'm gonna get diabetes from drinking it. But Cola Life tasted good.   I also have a personal tier list of best "source/container" for soda  1.Glass bottle. It gives a much cleaner taste, and there isn't an issue with overcarbonation. And it just looks better. Problem is most need a bottle opener, and it's less convinient to recycle where I live.  2. Plastic bottle. It isn't as pure as glass, but it still tastes great, and there's more variation in the size of the bottle. It's also re-sealable, so you don't have to drink all of it before the carbonation disappears. It's also more convenient to recycle than glass. You put it into a machine at your local grocery store that collects bottles and cans, the machine scans a code on the bottle or can, then you get a receipt you can cash in at the store.  3. Can. It depends, and honestly it could be next to plastic bottles. But sometimes there's a slight metallic taste, especially to Coca Cola's ones for some reason. They are also recyclable in that you can put them in the same machine as the plastic bottles.  4. Fountain. Honestly, I don't like them. They don't taste right, which is because of how it mixes the beverage, and the fact it relies upon the ice melting and thinning it out. And I most often don't get ice for my beverage, because I don't need it, and a cup of ice is obnoxiously loud.  But if there is one soda I truly wish I could drink again, it would be Grape Soda. A soda made with grapefruit, and part of my childhood  "The world has ever tasted" Meanwhile just showing a map of the US, as if the rest of the planet doesn't exist.  And Lastly, Diet soda isn't actuallty healthier than normal soda. Sugar has been under a lot of critizism, a lot of which is unjustified. But when it comes to soda, while diet may not use sweeteners like sugar, they are loaded with artificial sweeteners which the body may not even be able to break down. This isn't such an issue for diabetics, which diet soda was initially advertised for, but flooding a healthy body with sweetners the body can't break down can cause issues with your insulin levels, and can in some studies increase the likelyhood of developing diabetes. And even if we look past the sweet debate, a lot of sodas are fully of other things that aren't exactly part of your daily intake of vitamins. There's also the psychological aspect to take into account. Since regular soda is known to be unhealthy, you're potentially less likely to drink excessive amounts of it. However, diet soda is often advertised as the "healthier" option, and companies spends a lot of moneyt advertising their diet sodas by making is seem cool, hip, and good to drink diet. But in truth, diet is seen by many experts just as bad as regular soda. If you want to drink a true "diet soda", then what you need is just a glass of soda water, or carbonated water. Throw in some lemon juice or something if you want. But that is the ultimate "diet soda". It's just fancy water with bite
There’s no way
i prefer napój gazowany
I call it soda because its   SODAlicious
Haha  Soda Rise to the occasion   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Food theroy is turning into good mythical morning
No puma kola. Smh  Or Faygo? What
Soda.
Shasta diet cola
here in Canada its either POP and or coke
The rock paper scissors match absolutely killed me HAHA
I'm with y'all regional grocery store brand sodas are better than the big brands. I prefer the HEB version of Dr Pepper than the OG version.
I feel like the brackets are a little unfair
Diet pop has aspartame so, uh, don't drink diet pop XD  Oh, and, uh, Obviously by my above comment, B, pop. Soda always sounds weird to me XD I think of Baking Soda.
If you have watch the good mythical morning video taste test for drinks they did this simular but it was a great episode like this one is.
Citric acid wants to know your location
Pop
I tried it because of this video  Harris Teeter Diet Coke is fuckin bussin, glad I live in NC
Diet dew> Diet Coke
I'm B!
Sees Title: What is the world coming to
*title* I quit diet coke  *me* yeah... no
to answer the question, I use soda and coke depending on where I am; coke when at a restaurant or drive-thru, soda the rest of the time.
I’m soft drink
Sorry Matt but your mistake is limiting yourself to diet cola. I can proudly say that diet Dandelion and Burdock is far superior to any diet cola on the market including diet coke.  idk if dandelion and burdock is available in the US but its available in literally any UK supermarket and its delicious.
I know this episode is about diet coke, but tell me why Setph. looks like Agatha from WandaVision
I love when she calls him Matthew and also i welcome her to this world of youtube
pop because canada
You should get some guarana it is a Brazilian soda and it is super good they also have a diet version
I say other in my area, heres a day at a restraunt:  waiter: would you like an other with that me: yea ill take nurse chili
Why not drink Zevia?
How about no POP. Call it what it is fellow ohioan. POP POP POP
“You’ve probably never heard of it” Me in Maryland who regularly hits up food lion
Marylander here, I miss food lion, we had it but it shut down at the 2 areas in the state I was in.
B: soda
For me, in Latvia, we have Kola (pronunciation: kola :])
food lion has a whole brand of supermaket in Belgium named "Delhaize"
D:other
I say pop
Two takeaways here for me- A, it's so funny that I started watching this episode in my local Kroger. B, my little discovery with citric acids' role in a classic literary concoction may not be as outlandish as I believed.
I’m a pop, a Midwest thing
Or you could just stop drinking soda all together.
I mean 2020 was the year that I became a Diet Pepsi addict. Go figure, I guess.
20;45   Steph is literally all of us...
Did anyone else notice the glitches in the background in different parts of the video do they mean something or is that a mistake
Fun fact, original Cola flavor was meant to be a cough syrup which later on became a "treat for all remedies" it was then when Coca Cola took the recipe and made it a soda with a brand and such. probably Boylan still has the original recipe and thats why it tastes like syrup...
In the UK, in one of our super markets (Morrisons) there a is a cola that is 17p which I would never ever touch with a stick as I see people drink it then throw up (it is a 2 litre bottle BTW) it would stain your insides
I’m form South Carolina so if you don’t call it Coke you’re wrong
"Food lion, which you've probably never heard of..." AKA the second closest grocery to my house... Also definitely soda over pop or coke.
4:05 green screen zag.
me : read the title me when I click on the video : DISLIKE , DISLIKE!!!!!!
Coke Zero!!!
I call it pop, because I'm Canadian XD
Iced Tea works for me.
13:26 glitch in the matrix
Citric acid needs its own video at this point
Quit fnaf next.
I live in Michigan we call it pop
POV: You are scrolling through the comments.
Cap
13:30  There is a weird single frame with something on it. It looks like a glitch.
I like Big K from Kroger...but I'm not a diet soda drinker.
D; I call all soda by it's name
Who is this imposter?
He said he hated it tho he keep drinking it
i'm soda but sometimes when i'm feelin' old i'll call it pop
me lloking at all the stores:  none of those are in Canada :(
Man Mat must really be taking Steph leaving GTLive pretty rough haha
Stef looks great today
Mat Pat: I quit Diet Coke!  Me: wait that’s illegal
Really sad he probably won’t do this with root beer since that’s my Diet Coke/Harris Teeter
In israel we call it: Mugazim
here in south australia, we call it soft drink
Honestly I thought they were living in California. Interesting.
We also know that he simultaneously whipped and nay-nayed
No no I'm from the Midwest from St. Louis, and I agree with you about a lot, but it's Soda 😂
How's tasting diet cokes a theory
soda. but most people here in calgary say pop
in the uk if you get asked what coke you want its in a bag a cup
No Matpat Diet Coke quit YOU
As soon as I saw the title I clicked
Nothing is better than Kofola
B
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT FOOD LOIN? You know it in VA and WV too right? Family go there all the time.
One flaw I see in this right away is that you let fountain diet even compete here. Most places simply do not have fountain RC Cola. Now I'm fine with Diet Coke getting to have its best between can and bottle, but it seems silly to include the fountain version. If you are at the store picking up your Cola of choice you are going to be getting either cans or bottles (plastic or glass).  And sure if you stop somewhere like McDonald's and get yourself a value meal, you aren't going to have a choice like RC Cola or any of the others in your challenge, so of course, you'll go with your classic fountain Diet Coke.
Glad to see MatPat finally got out of the hellscape that is California.
Here in Ohio we only call it pop; I never hear anybody say soda here haha
d. refresco
i still stand with steph. coke zero is superior
That’s my brothers favorite drink
GMM already established -  fountain drink = worst drink
Never been so on edge about a rock paper scissors game
Shame Moxie isn't on the list. Then again, Moxie isn't cola, and its regional to the northeast so it couldn't even be on the list anyway.
When i read the title i was like: IT CANT BE TRUE
Being born and raised in the Midwest, I'm 1000% in the pop category. I will not ever call it anything else
anyone else think matpat scored the dream women am i right.
I say pop but my whole family says soda.
I love that MatPat's addiction has turned hugely passive aggressive💕😌
I’m soda
I would also quit Diet Coke too but I'm not a quitter
This is heresy mat
Matpat has been lying to us all along!
Oh my God matt has been wanting a sponsor from diet coke R.I.P.
He did it. And doing it is very comparable. MatPat giving up Diet Coke is like a King giving up his throne.
I read it as sans cola and i wanted it to read as sans cola.
JOIN THE PEPSI CREW
Never mind
That other thing is sans is ness guy
Pop, here in the UK.
Just thought I'd share that I'd been 'clean' of soda's for well over 6, going on 7, years now 😁
This guy won't even try any "flavored" cokes then likes the one with a little citric acid in it the most...
I have a feeling that the reason mat and stephanie don't like the "classic brands", is because non of them grew up with cane sugar, another note, lots of those products use factory ecces cane sugar, that was used for previous manufacturing
What about diet Mountain Dew
I'm not a diet coke person, but I am a die hard soda person, and I can fully agree, the source in which the soda comes from makes all the difference. I don't drink from fountain taps anymore, and sometimes I specifically buy a can or bottle, for that specific variant on the taste.
Pop
I was waiting for a Gfuel sponsor at the end to be the ultimate plot twist but it never showed up
To me, Coke Zero taste the closest to regular Coke so I’ll always stand by Coke Zero
Plot twist: this video was sponsored by harris teeter
fanta
I clicked on this so quickly
Now try diet soda vs anything else that doesn't taste like artificial sweetener garbage.
23:14 F in the chat for Fry's
To be honest I never  thought Matpat would ever quit diet Coke
Matpat is broken hes escaped the matrix
Up here in Maine, we don't say soda or pop. We say Sodeh.
Woooooww
4:05 is this another ARG thing or just a editing glitch?
i call it pop if i'm felling old time a softy if i'm felling werid. of a "mood insasser " wich is what they were market as befor the fda
I liked zevia the one time I tried it but meh each to their own
Good for you Matpat! You don't need it!
Big K cola caffeine fee is the best
Soft Drink.
Oh no
Oh man you guys have Publix?  Please do an episode about the superiority of their chicken tender subs.
Here’s my food theory: Is diet soda REALLY better for you than regular soda?
I bet he drank ten diet cokes right after
so he finally figured out that diet is worse for you unless you have a health condition like diabetes
As someone who has lived in southern Louisiana my whole life I have NEVER heard someone call all soda 'coke'. For me it was always 'soda' like "What soda would you like?"
DOCTOR PEPPER!!! IS THE BEST SODA IN EXISTENCE!!! ....in my chillaxed opinion
This seems like a very unhealthy idea
C cokeeeeeeee
Didn't they do a film theory on how the taste of drinks taste different with straws? the walle one.
I say pop.
Subtitles on at around 3:49
Nooooooooooooo!
Not sure if mat pat has a bad camera or he's trying to tease something
I'm Canadian so I call it Pop
Admit it you just wanted an excuse to buy a bunch of diet coke and write it off.
D: Bubbly Dubbly Snubbly Chubbly Drink
If it's not called soda it's wrong
As soon as I saw the thumbnail my brain exploded you haven’t even got the sponsorship yet and you’re just gonna quit
Hey, Matt, April Fools day is 14 days away
The first soft drink I ever had my dad called pop, and I called it pop till I was like 12. Then for some reason I started calling it soda. I live in Chicago, and nobody calls it pop.
anyone else notice the glitches through out the video?
*All the diet coke in the fridge* : Well, we are screwed
My local grocery is a Fry’s. I’m hearing that Fry’s and Harris Teeter are basically the same. I’ll keep that in mind.
I'm B no question
LIES
melon soda from japan would have a chance
#NC
impossible
In Ireland we call them fizzy drinks. Also, something I just found out recently is that we have a flavour of sodas called 'rock shandy' which is a mix of orange and lemon. I thought other countries had this flavor as well, but apparently not. Or it's at least not called 'rock shandy'.
I'm Dutch so it's "frisdrank" here, which roughly translates to "fresh drink"
HOW COULD YOU
Theirs a food lion near me but I live in PA
Wait, so will the MatPat-Stephanie (Theorist)household be buying both Harris Teeter and Coke Zero or will they go exclusively Harris Teeter Diet Cola?
Pop
B. Soda
skittles
Steph looks amazing 👏😍
And so the winds of change are a set as one and the reign of Diet Coke is no more.
i use stiva in cooking
Harris Teeter instantly gives Food Theory a sponsor, makes a TON of money, and Coke finally realizes the missed opportunity of not doing it sooner
Food Lion is only a NC thing- I- I thought everyone had the satisfaction of going to the lion store every week-
Oddly enough, living in upstate NY, I don't have any of these products available near me, but We do have Wegman's, Price Chopper, and Weis markets here. those are the only outliers since, like anywhere else, we have Walmart, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, etc. might be fun to do my own project like this based on what I can find around here.
B
Coke since i live in north carolina and its nice to see that my state is finally getting some good representation
Here in Australia we call all sodas "fizzy drinks"
Definitely coke no matter what it actually is
Why did mat quit diet coke for a year
D! Cola! And we call the bubble water soda!
Boylan‘s root beer is great
The day we never thought would come
That's pretty interesting to see the winner is possibly from my personal favorite brand for sodas, too (Kroger's manufacturer). However, I can't drink caffeine, and I wanted to stop staining my teeth, so I made the switch a decade ago from diet Dr. Pepper to ginger ale. I have tried every ginger ale and diet ginger ale available in my corner of Texas, and the only one that doesn't make me sick is the Kroger brand Big K regular ginger ale. The canned version also seems to have the longest lasting carbonation before going flat (after opening) compared to other brands.  Also, soda is my term of choice, but I'm a traitor to my home state because Texans do usually say coke for any type of soda.
I feel bad for mat
As long as you keep the memes.
To be fair, sometimes Florida feels like it's own region/country. I don't think Steph's slip was a true slip.
D: Cooldrink (ZA)
He is not!
I know you for SIMULTANEOUSLY WHIPPING AND NAE-NAEING
Soda
Pepsi definitely the best
Root beer is better the coke a cola
Personally, I've been an addict of a half-and-half mix of Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Cherry Pepsi, though such a mixture was originally born from my need to find a replacement for the Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper that my local supermarket stopped selling. Lately, however, I'm opening up to the idea of mixing Diet Dr. Pepper with some Diet Cheerwine.
It's POP!
Man this is cool
Me, drinking Big K diet cola: "I wonder if Harris Teeter is owned by Fry's/Kroger" Mat: Harris Teeter is owned by Kroger.
TRAITOR
Coke
carbonated bleach is my favorite
Coke Zero :)
Here in Hawai'i we say "SODA"🥤🤙
I always used either the specific name or soft drink.
I feel like they should have had fountain diet pepsi since they liked the fountain diet coke best... it seems like those would be more even
As someone who lives in NC, it kinda surprised me when you said that some may not recognize the name "Food Lion"
You cant buy fountain diet coke in the store though!
I have and probably always will be Pop
If you wanna get rid of your diet coke life then try PEPSI AND FANTA
It sucks to be Canadian
Seeing Steph in these videos heals my heart a little bit ;_;
Pardon me while I go plow down strangers at Harris Teeter to grab me some of this liquid from the gods.
taste off between store brands now!!!
Diet coke is still Superior
Did anyone else see the one frame of colors at 13:31? Matt you know you made me skim in .25x speed for like 10mins trying to see if you’re adding little 1 frame Easter eggs lol. This is food theory not Fight club.
New title: whoever edited this got tortured
Soda
Pepsi diet, i dont know it taste good, that’s the only reason I drink it.
I'm impressed that Diet Coke didn’t win
Oh no... The world is collapsing as we know it. MatPat is giving up Diet Coke!
C
Oh god
im SODA
i cant drink diet soda because it has a gross chemical aftertaste to me, i dont have this problem with normal soda and my mom is the same way
Umm what was that at 4:06 ??? Some kind of green lines all over the screen
4:05 does any one else see that. Also 8:10 13:30
Impossible.
Putting fountain drinks into the bracket makes zero sense. When you get cola from a fountain it means you're going to a restaurant, where your choice in colas is predetermined.  UNLESS you're buying your own cola fountain.
2:13 it’s 69 Teams
I love Food lion's diet soda. It's so cheep but consistently good.
soda.
13:31 i feel like that was intentional
Me: **Sees thumbnail** What does that remind me of?  Matpat: Well, Diet Coke, we had some great times together.  🎶 When I was only three, I drank some very good coke, I drank some very good coke, I purchased, with a fake ID, My name was Brian McGee, I stayed up watching Toonami, When I was only three 🎶
I HAVE BIG K OMGGGGG
you gave up after just 6 draws in a row in rock paper scissors? me and my best friend once tied THIRTY TIMES in a row. (he beat me. but we were doing it to decide who would get to go first in a board game and i won the board game, at least). it's funny, rock paper scissors gets more ties the more in sync you are with someone; it's the only game i know of that gets LESS fun the better you know your partner
The world has ended
Citric acid deep state
I've always called it soda. As I only drink water nowadays, (getting old sucks!) This was merely of academic interest for me. But thanks for the fun format.
Map is like my mom they both like that drink and they both can tell if it’s bottled or a can
I wanna try the Harris teeter coke
I understand that Americans can drink more soda than UK bc its warmer
Pop! Its in the Pittsburghesse dictionary.
For a moment, I half thought Matt was going to reveal some unknown horror truth that made him stop drinking his favorite drink in the whole world... glad it wasn’t that XD
I was born this month
I am from South Carolina and I totally understand the love for store brand soda. I also call soft drinks soda or coke. Also MatPat, I highly recommend you try Cheerwine and Diet Cheerwine.
Mat: says kroger: My brain: low low low low low low
Do a colab with Mr beast
You want a sodapop?
Pop
Sorry... that's the mom in me
We love y’all, Jesus loves y’all, It’s a good day Fam
Big-K Cola Oh! From Kroger is probably right.
what
It will never be replaced Diet Coke pat forever
Sees title: No, impossible
8:09 TF was that?
Man I quit life
What about Pepsi zero sugar matpat hmm 😠
no way
that's honestly amazing that matpat has actually chosen a cola that he, Matt Pat the ultimate cola connoisseur , has chosen above Coca-Cola
Yoooo i gave up coke in 2020!!!!!
I wish they'd taken a long break before the final round.
I love how Mat called Foodlion a small brand when in fact the brand itself is really expanded across Europe.
I cal soda: brus
Publix is awesome - I’ll not have the name sullied here! Also had Food Lion growing up in Florida - you can go ahead and sully their name. And I agree, all soda is Coke, no matter what kind.
no way
Meh, Pepsi's still better.

I am going to Smith’s tomorrow to test this
I am P O P
C coke. This be coke country
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Video hasn't started yet, and I'm calling it now, this has to be clickbait.
The day has come, this is when the universe shall fall apart
NOOOOOOOOOOOO 👎😞😞😞
Welp diet coke has just lost 50% of the monthly revinew
I've watched this channel since it came out, and just now noticed that the McDonalds in the intro was called "Matdonalds"
What about no soda?
Well... time to get rid of any stocks for Diet Coke.
Watch two grown adults taste test Diet cola in a death match of which ones better.
Diet Dr. Pepper.
Grew up in the midwest/central US, and over here you get a mix of the Soda and Pop people.   I myself am a Soda person
Should be easy to find a replacement considering Diet Coke is like the worst soda available.
what
it's sh-as-ta
This is click bait. I shan't stand for this!
Why why on my day off do you have to bring up Kroger I can't escape from it even on my day off!!!
Stop the cap.
Has anyone noticed the flashes of color bars.
I'm surprised you'd allow diet coke to be a fountain drink instead of controlling the variable like an actual scientific experiment... Why compare fountain diet coke to canned and bottled alternatives? IMO the fountain diet coke was a huge misplay but was still a fun episode.
I live in NC and I would like to say that the food lion brand soda is better than I expected. The food lion Dr. Perky holds up really well against Dr. Pepper. I haven't tried a blind taste test or anything but it's good.
other like ive grown up calling the drink by its name like if i wanted coca cola i would say coke or like dr. pepper i would ask for dr. pepper
I saw the title of this and me knowing how much he loves Coke my first thought was, "you what"
Here in Kansas it's pronounced pop
with the last 2 videos i have come to the conclusion that MatPat is running out of ideas for this channel!
If you want an other interesting video on diet drinks, then I recommend watching "What One Sip of Diet Soda Does to Your Brain" on the Brew channel.
Food lion is also in Maryland
Srill can't see the appeal in carbonic acid, but for you guys that do.   How can anyone enjoy dr.pepper?
Now I want to see you guys try regular Colas too... Sorry, you can probably not even look at a cola for a week after all that testing. But it would be very interesting to see how cane cola does against the corn syrup versions. In Europe we don't really use corn syrup even in Coca Cola and US imported Coke taste differently.
Drink water
Food Lion is North Carolina based? I've never seen them too far from Delaware, but haven't been to NC very much. Neat fact.
SOMEONE HAS REPLACED MATPAT! HE WOULD NEVER QUIT DIET COKE!
Should have tried caffeine free diet coke
That’s just me with Dr. pepper
the problem with art sweetener pops unlike sugar is they go bad. as they get close to expiry date it  become tinny. so for to be fair bottling date matters.
So basically, march madness is when a stack of basketball teams try to find the best one smash bros tournament style. Did i get that right? Also edit: I agree with Steph when it comes to what cola i like. A cold coke zero can't be topped! Ok maybe it can by a good chocolate milk but it can't by any other cola! And i stand by that😝
D  Also for the soda name i will sometimes say pop or coke but mostly soda and coke normally used for coke
We have food lion in Tennessee too POG
I'm more surprised that they agreed on the fountain diet coke being the best.  I think it's all gross, but fountain drinks rank lowest of forms of soda
Years later we are gonna see the “Only ogs will remember MatPat’s obsession with Diet Coke” Comments
Ive been to Food Lion on a family trip once, they have a nice store in my opinion
I actually have a Fredmyers in my city. Next time I'm there, I'll have to try their diet coke and see if it's how you describe it
Me after seeing the winner:  👁 👁    👄
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE COKE
Hey Mat why not try Ramune (a Japanese soda that’s light and refreshing). If you want to try. 😊
mat pat live in NC??
EVERYONE CHECK THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK, THIS COULD MEAN WE'RE GONNA DIE
Coke
POP
i thought this was gonna be about how diet coke is bad. So glad its not lmao
You missed orange juice
4:06 green bars going across the screen, if anyone is looking for hint to the AR or something idk  Also mcdonalds is its own brand of coke product due to their containment.
B
I perfer canned diet coke
I was hoping for 0 sugar so Mat can be healthy, but the ending was still nice
I am not fan of diet drinks. The sweeteners taste real funky. Great test though. I am still waiting for a zero sweetener cola to launch along with drinks lile La Croix and Bubbly. Im down to try some no sweetener cola.
Me:*see's title*  Also Me: No...............
A and B
i feel like I'm watching my parents divorce all over again
I'm a fan of dandelion and burdock soda as an alternative to cola. Easy to find in UK, not sure about US. Sounds crazy to people who've not heard of it, but it's very real, I swear. xD
All I know is that my favorite cola is Pepsi Max
Aww yes I call it other can I have some other
Coke coke
Lier
Traitor
I call it something else I call it bubbly beverage
C. Coke
There is nothing that makes me more nervous every time I do it than tieing in rock paper scizzors
I am a fizzy drink kinda guy. I live in Australia btw
D in Australia we just call it soft drink
I live in Florida, can confirm the existence of Publix. In places like Illinois, because I was born there and lived there for a little less than half my life, the equivalent to it would be Jewel-Osco
B
your lying
Diet Coke: the day i lost my free advertisement...😭 Harris Teeter: YEEHAW 🥳🥳🥳
Its good to see you dealing with your addiction
Lol I add lemon to my TOAST bcz its so good
You are lying.
I've been waiting for this video for a while now.
Today I learned that Food Lion is only in the mid to south atlantic. I'm so used to Food Lion that I call small plastic bags "food lion bags".
where is matpat and what have you done to him
The stingy jaguar logistically copy because turret philosophically brush apropos a nebulous sea. witty, quaint north korea
I’m a midwestern soda girl
Watching this while drinking diet pepsi Edit: darn
You guys dont drink Coke with lemon  and ice....? :V omg brazil really is better, as here also is common to season food with orange and lemon  Edit: you can also drink Sprite with lemon and ice and guarana soda with orange. So another point is you can eliminate Harris T. uniqueness with a slice of lemon in your cup lol
omfg really nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I think you should try curiosity cola if it is available near you.
Mat: Harris Teeter is a small regional grocery chain along the U.S eastern seaboard Me: lives near the eastern seaboard
POP!!
i mirror matpat's obsession with diet cola with my own obsession for Dr. Pepper
D  Where I live we call it cooldrink
I can't even tell the difference between phanta and sprite seriously if you gave me a red bull and mtn dew I couldnt tell the difference
Me who lives in nc: i know what food lion is
us New Oleans boyz and grills go with Cold Drink
Harris Teeter jumping on the sponsor wagon yet?
Soda
He also makes a big deal that diet Pepsi was edged out by food lions brand of diet cola and that food lion is a North Carolina home grown brand, but..... Pepsi was literally made and created and started in New Bern, NC. He knows that right?
I grew up in the south and call it Soda as a general coke term. And yes, I remember food lion even though they've since gone away around here
did i see a blue devils logo
Does anyone else see the wierd glitch flashes appering. I even checked and it's not my comp, it's edited in.
There’s a pic-and-save in town 20 miles away.  But i never drink diet.  xD
Coca-Cola adds more flavoring in there fountain drinks compared to there cans and bottles so the first drink taste the same as the last and it doesn’t get watered down due to ice
As a Pepsi Max drinker i have to try diet rite? But I have never seen it in my country...
Now, with a different Coke in the fridge, maybe Harris Teeter is willing to do what Diet Coke never did and sponsor an episode!
Game theory is finally gonna end matpats addiction to diet coke
As a fan of bitter and sour flavours; it doesnt surprise me at all that citric acid keeps bein key to so many foods. You need that balancing sour note to rly help make the overall experience more enjoyable, esp with highly sugar or highly fatty foods; bcuz without some bitter or sour notes it will be overpoweringly sweet or fatty. Which is sometimes enjoyable, but in sips not in glugs, heh. (See that cough syruppy soda for what i mean)  My drink of choice is actually just slightly lemon or lime or other sour flavoured water (ideally seltzer water bcuz bubbly is better) and I mean very slightly flavoured. It doesnt even rly need sugar/sweetener in it for me but if it has sugar i can flavour the water more and not risk havin an extra bitter drink cuz of that heh. I dont like most fake sugars tho as theyre overpoweringly sweet alrdy and even moreso to me as a person who almost nvr invests highly sweet stuff except if its frozen (cold makes flavours more bearable; same reason beer and alcohol ads always encourage drinking the coldest of drinks).  Funny thing is I can totes guzzle a coke or any offbrand coke (except pepsi, or similarly extra sweet colas) bcuz they have enuf acids and bubbles to mute the flavours, esp when combined with drinking them ice cold and my havin spent most my life guzzlin them heh. But like, a frosted cake? I cant devour such a thing, bcuz the frosting is cloyingly sweet to me.
Cherry Coke Zero Sugar > all other diet soda
Nooooooo
Do you really!?!??
For st pateixks day you should make a video on lucky charms
MatPat, great job getting rid of the addiction, I stopped drinking soda and have stopped for almost 5 years
You should theorize if it is possible for dogs to pilot vehicles (PAW PATROL)
I love our store brand lemonade (Pick n Pay in South Africa) a lot more than the expensive brand name lemonade we can buy here.
Me when i see the title: What? No you didnt hehe
WHAA i thought Mat Pat lived in LA??
13:48 Mat Pat just turned in to a whole dragon. Mans is mystical
that lady is attractive
Its cold pop
Did you see the glitch at 2:30
Wait you drink diet coke...
🌺💕🌸👑 YES I GOT HERE WITHIN THE HOUR!👑🌸💕🌺
The Coke I got in Egypt always tasted better the from the USA. Different sugar and water.
Soda guy here
Plot Twist:   This was all a scheme to get Coca Cola to sponsor MatPat      Or was it-
13:30 ...???
rootbeers better...            yes, I'm challenging you.
3:45 look at captions lol
This is unlike you Mat. Please, come back to being your true self again! I miss the Coked up MatPat already.
this might be the end of the world
I am team coke
"I QUIT Diet Coke!" No, impossible. Something must be wrong with the Sacred Texts
Dr Pepper is the best soda  No question
North Carolina resident here We call soda here, hear coke more torwards the mountains and upper nc
I cant tell if the blinking colors are for an upcoming arg or just a video bug
Why are the same seed numbers repeated? Seriously who was in charge of counting???
When my family gets a lot of soda we get diet Dr.Pepper. We only get a lot of it when we’re gonna be home a lot more of when we all need a pick me up. So hurricane season really
As another midwestern transplant to NC, I will tell you that not only is the store brand in NC Top dog, it's cheaper than coke.
You guys are insane, zevia is the best. It has completely taken over my soda intake.
First steph, now this!
Harris Teeter better sponser matpat now!
Who are you, and what have you done with Matpat.
So you basically dieted Diet Coke huh
Ive only seen like, the first 30 sec, but i recomend having 2 or 3 main sodas
About time
Coca Cola now will all of a sudden offer you a sponsorship
soda
I call it Coke/soda cuz Atlanta is my home.
Pepsi : diet Pepsi
I keep seeing 1 fram flashes of green on my screen is my phone broken or is mattpat up to something?
D: where i live it translates to "Fresh"
Theres a coka cola life?      wait... is there a coka cola death?
I’m a “soda” person
I live in North Carolina and I ALWAYS, and i mean ALWAYS buy the store brand. I mean, its 50 cents to A dollar,  and i love the taste aswell! I call it soda, not pop or coke. Its funny how game theory AND mrbeast live in my state! I used to have a harris teeter not even 0.2 miles away. I lived in Wilmington, NC. Ive liver in NC my whole life.
we might've bullied him about going insane due to diet coke in the last video too much
I don't drink soda with corn syrup, but I make an exception for Shasta. My grandpa always brought an ice chest of Shasta.
My favorite soda is Dr. Pepper
Shasta got Sasha-ed AOT fans?
Pop is the only way to go
15:28 On the East coast of Canada, we call it pop.  I didn't even realize it was called Soda elsewhere until I heard it in a TV show when I was a kid lol.
I read that Diet Coke was invented because they couldn't get the formula to taste right with the artificial sweeteners at the time (1982).  With the changes to formulation of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (between 1985 and 2005),  Coca-Cola was able to return to their original cola formula in 2005 and just replace the sweetener.
soda
this is more shocking than mark quitting Del Monte.
coke 0
Are pepsi zero and pepsi max the same?
I call it Soda Pop.
try mr pibb
I was legitimately going to recommend Kroger because it’s what I usually drink... this is so weird. From one big Diet Coke fan to another, I can back MatPat up on this one.
Everyone in my family and all my friends call it pop but I for some reason have always said soda. Which is very noticeable when im the only one. I dont like diet soda though
I'm glad we can still see Stephanie through food theory.
I quit Cola when they said they h8 people like us Pat because our skin color
C
We have a Food Lion in Glasgow Kentucky
NANI!?!?!?!
No diet Dr. Pepper? Shame.
"Hi, yes, one medium other please."
Citric acid is so popular because it's super easy to manifacture and it's the go to for weak acid compounds. I mean, I doubt FDA would ever approve a soda with nitric acid...
I'm from upstate NY and I think the most common variant here is soda. That's what I tend to use, at least. Though I've also occasionally heard it said as "soda pop," so I always assumed that was the full version, and that the people here who called it "pop" were just truncating "soda pop" but were also just too much in a rush to say "soda." Another fairly common way of referring to it here is "soft drinks."  So essentially I've heard everything here, and I wasn't ever confused hearing someone from somewhere else calling it something other than "soda." xD The 2 things that really blew my mind when I first learned about the regional differences were 1) the fact that people from the south just call everything "coke," and 2) that the regional variations were *so* strong that some people somehow had no idea that any other variations existed. o.0
What is the meaning of Seeds
Bu...but, Mat your whole thing is wanting to be sponsored by Diet Coke. Your throwing away your Coke rep.
my parents are super cheap and since I grew up in North Carolina I  grew up with harris teeter brand soda so this isn't surprising at all.....
for poor people, sams cola is amazing lol. and i know from experience. lmao
The day Matt quit Diet Coke is the day we know something bad is coming
Kroger 0MG Diet Cola has long been my go-to when I want something to put Whiskey in! Also, I'm in "pop" country, but I try to call beverages by their name… or "beverage"… but it often still comes out "pop."
isnt foodlion part of delhaize?
In my opinion the worlds best soda is Faxe Kondi which is like 7up but way different!  It is only found in Denmark but it is the best!!
B: Soda
Stupid theory man proves himself an absolutist and deems only one kind of soda worthy of drinking.
Dare I even ask?... What about Diet Pepsi? It's a Diet Cola.
I have coke zero in my fridge. Do I add citric acid to it?
Matt is SHOOKETH!
Me when i first saw this:     Wait. This is illegal.
I clicked pause when you said your looking for soda replacement and I am 100% sure you would love the Indian soda called Limca.
In the UK it's fizzy drink!
this is how you get views
B: Soda.
Do they live in North Carolina now?!? Is he in my hometown as we speak??
when the diet coke here's this video: Traiter you went with my cousin
i think hiding the liquid would help mitigate the potential bias for diet coke
IRN-BRU
I remember when he started not drinking diet coke he would count the days. Then they stopped mentioning it so I thought he started drinking it again
::::::::::::::Spoilers::::::::::       Harris Teeter beat out Diet Coke because Diet Coke never sponsored
I audibly went "NO" when I saw the title
15:29 us New Jerseyans call it soda
FOOD LION REPRESENT!!
Me: sees the title  Also me: noooooooooooo
Smh, plastic straws....       Cannot even drink out of cup.
Cool NC
I got a nice soda i drink called water doesn’t really taste great though
Plot twist: Diet Coke sponsors them right after this video
MAT IS QUITTING DIET COKE!? GET YOUR SUPPLIES, THE WORLD IS ENDING!!!
That's kinda funny that Kroger and Harris Teeter do the same considering I love Kroger's orange pop far more than any other kind I've tried other than Faygo. I'm kinda not shocked by the results anymore after that. The only problem is when flat they're all gross lol
Ohio represent! Its pop!
D: here in the UK wen we want a fizzy drink we just ask for it by name. eg. a can of coke, a can of fanter.
A
Shocked face diet Coke has been dethroned🙀
NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! diet coke is the besr
Soft Drink is the only right answer down in AU
You know, stephs face at the end says it all
Food lion is all on the east coast like their are some in Virginia West Virginia and Maryland
I never like diet coke and zero coke they had a werid fake taste to it but i do enjoy diet A&W thats a good diet root beer no real fake taste just like less sugar in it.
Try caffeine free diet Coke                                                                           Coca Cola Zero is the best
Coke Zero?
I don’t believe this.
shasta is just sad, really
Destiny took him to Harris Teeter that morning, what he would learn about himself, would shock him.
MATHEW QUIT DIET COKE?!?!?!?!?
When I come to the main cola wars I prefer Diet Coke than diet Pepsi as Pepsi is to sweet. And having a diabetic dad as the taste tester to know which drink is the diet one Coca Cola and Diet Coke have a different taste easy know which one which when it come to Pepsi I never know which one is diet as both are very sweet.
14:39 I live down the street from one of those
So american

Why do people hate the Sans is Ness theory? I thought it was pretty interesting.
It's Pop, and I live in Western Canada.
Down with the Diet Coke! Long Live the Diet Coke!
We can all agree that this is Mat disguising trying out new Colas as a business expense
Kirby fans at 3:13 must be triggered
Why do each pop have a "seeded" rank? What does it mean?

Everyone i know calls them gassy drink
The food theorists was only created because of this episode lol
pick regular coke. :>
"You've probably never heard of Food Lion." Tell that to people in Maryland.
Pop
I just saw the thumbnail and title and my heart sank
I'm sorry, but it's pop. I will occasionally tolerate soda pop if someone is trying to be less controversial, but not often.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I don’t even know you anymore MatPat!
A
also mat i thought you lived in california
Rock paper scicors against a mirror
Pepsi Max has always been the superior diet cola, and Dr Pepper is superior to both (and actually isn't a cola)
Yo doctor pepper
Another thing that we know about Matpat is that he “JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHIPPED AND NAE NAED!”
impossible, it can’t be, you were the choose one for the Diet Coke
How could you forget sundrop "the golden cola"
MatPat: So we testing sodas here The normal shop sodas: Allow us to introduce ourselves
D: other. We just call it fizzy
WHICH fountain company is that from if its McDonald's that's a different formula
i have never had Boylan cola but the rest of boylan flavours are amazing
top 10 anime deaths
Funny enough. I used to work for Kroger Manufacturing. And you would be suprised at how many different brands come from the same place.   What's extra funny is that I now work for coca-cola. So either way this is an eppisode topic I actually knew all about before it aired. 😁 but it was still super enjoyable.
Try big red it takes like gum
I’m a fizzy drink kinda guy
I'm just going to pretend I never saw this video

Top ten saddest anime betrayals
Fun fact: Food Lion is originally a Belgian supermarket chain called "Delhaize", which has been around since the 19th century!
Pepsi is great matmap I got addicted to it
I grew up with soda. However, my family in Pennsylvania and in Florida both say pop. I had to remember to call it pop around them cause it caused a super upset about which is right. I was always outnumbered.   P.s. I’m going to Harris teeter to buy that diet coke. I’m an avid Diet Coke drinker and my mom is a Diet Coke-aholic. I want to do a blind taste test.
I almost thought this was a prank for april 1st but then I realized it is still march
Hey Matt pat you should try Haribos Fizzy Cola, really good gummies with that citrus flavor
Kroger's Diet Root Beer is the best on the market, imo. I don't remember if I ever tried their Diet Coke. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's really good too.
Pop👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am soda
Is there a new arg?
NO DIET COKE R.I.P 1982-2021 :(
1. I love Coke Zero with a bit of lemon. So the citric acid thing makes sense. 2. They also do a Coke made with Stevia (cut with a little sugar) called Coke-a-Cola Life. It was not Zero calorie, but I though it was okay. 3. As somebody who has gastric bypass surgery I should not drink carbonated beverages, so this episode was interesting but... not “actionable”. (I tried to let Coke Zero go flat before I drank it and 24 hours was NOT ENOUGH. The result was painful and unpleasant.) So I’m always on the lookout for a beverage that will hit the cravings I have for soda without the bubbles.
Funny how we have food lion in our country renamed as mega image. Its kind of a big deal here in romania
boyaln is what i imagine sploodge from holes tastes like
Mat: Food Lion, based in NC which you’ve probably never heard of Me, in Maryland: 👁👄👁
I wouldn't be surprised if Harris Teeter cola was Kroger's brand soda. Kroger's soda brand is on par, if not better than named brands. They have so many flavors.
I tried diet coke I felt like I was going to die, carbonated water with something in it
pov: you're wondering if your not the only one that can see the green glitchy lines
Soda
im a soda guy
As a semi truck driver I can confirm that these products are all the same and made at the same factory and I get to deliver them to different chains
I think your taste buds are better than mine!
Mellow yellow is my favorite
In the thumbnail he kinda looked like morgz with brown hair hehe
That's just an episode. A GMM Episode!
I love boylan soda so much. EXPOSURE!!!!!
8:10 what is with the green thing falling in front of the camera?
Is anyone else seeing screen tearing in this episode?
Drink sprite that is all
The answer is water MatPat. Drink more water!
I dont like any diet coke or pepsi
I found that Diet Pepsi is surprisingly not much different from regular Pepsi in terms of flavor. Pepsi Zero is even closer.
Wait, if Diet Dr. Pepper isn't a cola, then what the heck is it?! I think Diet Dr. Pepper should be considered. I can understand no offshoots like diet A&W or Diet Sprite, but ya snubbed Diet Dr. Pepper for no reason, MatPat!
In South Africa its called cool drink
I prefer coke zero more.
I'm sad Cheerwine didn't make an appearance
Here in the UK its mainly pop or if its actually a cola drink then sometimes coke
other- just soft drink, or the brand name
When you went on private label products I really hoped I could find a place, but it doesn’t look like they have a place in Quebec.
Matpatt You have abandoned the darkness, Now you will be Devoured by light. you are now a Sphynx of learning and power
I was just tricked into watching people drink coke for half an hour... I don’t even like coke...
Don't deprive us of content. I want a mat pat road trip series seeking out his new special sauce ;)
am I the only one wondering why the screen was glitching randomly
impossible
Soda
All those bottles are filled with diet cola plot twist.
Mat:Nobody is gonna say Coca Cola Zero Sugar  Jacksepticeye:....
As a fellow North Carolinian, I’d love to assist on the next soda-centric episode!
Diet coke was to late to sponsor him
Congratulations Mathew you are quitting diet Coke Diet Coke is it bad for people that’s been replacing people for years zero sugar and only has 5 cals they are lying thanks Mathew Diet Coke!
TIL Food 4 Less is the same company as Fred Meyer... Huh. Those two are completely different clienteles bein marketed to so it makes sense i guess.  Which means that when the local food 4 less changed to mega foods; its probs bcuz they left the  kroger franchise entirely. Likely so they cud compete better with local stores.
They forgot styrofoam cups because it makes it less fizzy  but I guess you don't drink out of styrofoam cups every day. Thanks for the video Also normal coke is great.
L
14:38 Im honestly weirded out to see people call Harris teeter and food lion   "Local"
Am I the only one that caught Matt claiming Florida is in the South West? Florida is that farthest East you can go. xD   On that note I'm a hard C. Grew up saying Coke a lot singularly, but Soda was a plural form.
B
how is this man
Hope those arent warm... You gotta try them all cold to get accurate taste results to prevent carbonation loss
[B]
i definitely call it soda and also spoilers in comments
ngl, this title surprised me more than when I found out MatPat was a father
I have a Harris teeter near me house. Sometimes I just love maryland
Soda
Root beer is great
In my country is no alcohol thingy idk how its said btw I'm from bulgaria
I was sooooooo sprist he didnt chos diet colu
I mean with how racist coke is you'd think he quit months ago.
Pepsi is my favorite (not diet normal) and I refuse to believe anything else, there's nothing wrong with Coke but to me Coke tastes sweeter than Pepsi and I'm not really a fan of sweet stuff, I like that Pepsi is a bit more bitter and like other Sodas it's got that burn to it too which is great, one day I'm going to buy a pet Goat and name it Pepsi.
I am both a pop and soda guy despite growing up in Minnesota
Noooooooo
Back in 2019 I had to quit drinking Diet Coke because my mom said it could cause cancer  So I don’t drink Diet Coke anymore instead I drink water and Frappe  Also “Diet Coke doesn’t have calories” I call bull crap on that Diet Coke has tons of sugar in it
Did Matt marry a jew?
I agree with some local store brands taste better to me than name brand ones shout to Schnucks
Pop makes no sense its called soda because soda doesn’t pop  Edit: Soda dances
Lmao duke crying when he said duke it out cuz they didn’t make it haha
There is no soda here, only coke
Me an mat have the same fad bruh lmfaooo
Me: hates carbonated drinks Also me:* InTeReStInG! *  Also, here in south east England,  we call it just fizzy drinks, or the name of the kind of fizzy drink it is (ie. Cola, lemonade, cherryade, sparkling water, ect)
I'm pop
I thought this day would never come
I call everything coke
I saw the title and thought "this will be the ultimate clickbait." Have not finished the video yet
This whole tournament is absolutely useless because the taste of 1 diet cola changes if you drink another 1 right before it :/
The other other OTHER thing he is known for is Ness = Sans
Stevia is the worst. Although I'm really not a fan of most other artificial sweeteners either (nor the corn syrup the US seems to put everywhere)
So what up with the video glitch at 13:31?  I know mattpat loves to put cryptic thing embedded in sometimes.
All this time I thought he lived in California. Now as a North Carolinian, why you no drink diet Sun Drop!?
12:06 When did this become an opinion on the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy
Am I the only one picturing Matt Patt packing a minivan up the front seat with Harris Teeter, and then driving back to California with it?
I never thought the day would come
here in WA I grew up calling it "pop" until middle school-ish and then transitioned into "soda"
You should try oolong tea from the brand big e low. You can buy em from amazon. Plus, put stevia in it. 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces, 1.5 if you want it sweeter. This brand truvia is better cus it has sugar, stevia, and a couple other sweeteners. I’m pop btw. =]
Oooooohhhh god its happening everyone stay calm
Diet coke lost their chance for a sponsor spot
I never knew you were in NC... hello from the other Carolina! (SC) also food lion and Sam's cola are great, we drink those often too
funny how matt said ooooh pepsi zero uses aspartame and these countries don't allow aspartame, bad pespi bad. But doesn't mention that diet coke and coke zero also use aspartame.
Soda and pop in Florida mix and match a lot
Now im thirsty for the God's Nectar.
23:13 why there aren't eny of these stores in finland :(
Hey
Get Fritz Cola from Germany
Good.
Just replace it with lemon water. Dont let yourself get addicted again!
You know mat that diet coke and sugar free coke is really bad for you, even normal coke is better for you.
What is this?
I’m drinking Diet Coke while watching this... sus. 👀🍵
You should try diet coke from a Russian company called каждый день and redline  ,they are horrible but I want to see you suffer
15:30  Here in Australia I grew up with calling it soft drink! Anything else sounds whack to me
I actually couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the notification
bad frame at 8:10 and 13:21
Fresca, fresca’s pretty good
Normally coke but I call it everything from Coke to Fizzy Drinks
Steph her mouth falls right open when matpat says "the cola that i live for"
I never thought this day would come also my  preferred drink is Pepsi max
I didn’t know you guys lived in North Carolina I actually went there once to see my grandparents. I wish I could’ve visited you guys.
Why are we not talking about how may saw three beakers of Diet Coke and was like “yup that’s the can” and then tasted one and was like “yup that’s the bottle”
I am currently living in Belgium and thought that Food Lion logo looked familiar.... turns out that "North Carolina-based" local brand is owned by Ahold Delhaize - a Dutch company who runs shops all over Europe, including a Delhaize market down the street from my house.
I used to say pop growing up, but nowadays, I find myself saying soda. Sometimes, when I feel particularly singsongy about fizzy soft drinks, I’ll say soda pop, but like the one song says the word lollipop. Soda pop, soda pop, oh, soda soda soda soda pop, soda pop, oh soda soda soda soda pop! (popping sound with the mouth) ba dum bum bum
Is it just me or is there something popping up for a single frame at ab9ut 4:05-4:07?
Congratulations
I though Mat Pat lived in California
Out here in Northern Indiana we call it pop.
This was karma for never sponsoring any of the theory channels
Imagine if big soda brands ACTUALLY entered a competition in which they attempted to engineer matpats new favorite soda...   THE ULTIMATE SODA-OFF
B. Soda
D: Cola
Stay safe during the storm
Here in the Pacific Northwest we use both Soda & Pop interchangeably. PNW natives at least do
We've always called it Cola in the South. I like Dr. Pepper but if you go to a restaurant they'll say "What type of Cola do you want?"
Unfortunately they don't have kofola
3:44 with subtitles
I dont understand drinking diet anything drink real ice cold coke if your going to drink any  (Mt Dew based on meal but never BK coke)
Let's end the pop vs soda debate for all go type in pop on Google then type in soda on Google tell me which one gives you images for what you looked up. Go on I'll wait.
8:09 13:30 21:05
MatPat: makes this video  Me: WAIT THAT ILLEGAL
Minnesota it is pop
this is really good! Like shockingly good lol
How to know the world is ending: Matpat stops drinking diet coke
Yeeeeeeees, I was rooting for Harris Teeter and they won!
Why do you need to change drinks in the first place?
You need to try the Beverly it’s definitely worth getting a weekly shipment.😏
Coach Greg has entered the chat
I thought this wouldn’t happen
:(  :( :( :( sad
I saw the title n I immediately just went "NO FKING WAY" 0-0
No judgement. I have as many opinions on reeses and southern biscuits as Matt has on Diet coke
2 signs from the universe in one day congrats
HOW COULD YOU
I wish it was pepsi 0 :(
Cole Zero is the best one I've tried, out of Canadian store brand and name brand options
i am so happy that my boi north carlina is good to you mat
All Diet Soda Pops shouldn't be drank. Though if you insist on Diet then Zevia is best. Additionally screw Coca-Cola now due to PC Libtard Bullshit. Drink regular Soda Pop from Pepsi or none-mainstream. Also I like Boylan and other classic Pops like that. Aspartame is common in Diet pops and is toxic to your brain thank you Monsanto... Sucrose and Sucralose are bad as well also highly chemical. Best sweetener is real Cane Sugar, then Honey, then Beet Sugar, then Syrups, then Stevia.
Coke is going broke. Is it sad?🤔
HOW FRICKING COULD YOU
Has anyone actually noticed the slight-slight glitching throughout the video?
Espera, espera, espera enserio? Mat y diet coke es algo tan clásico como James y la Rolin rock Edi: bueno eso no me lo esperaba.................... cítrico
Meanwhile : Im over here drinking a liter of coke daily and getting addicted to the point that its like the Snorting kind of coke
Can someone please talk about the edited shaftsta can that said loser flavor 😂
Why is drinking diet coke bad for you? Im a caffeine free diet coke guy.
I really thought this title was clickbait- Cant wait to watch the theory!
We're other here we call it fizzy
From England we call it fizzy all carbonated drinks are fizzy :)
This wouldn’t have happened if Coca Cola just sponsored him 😂
The title showed coke ain’t best
MIKE TYSON GOES DOWN! LITTLE MAC WINS!!!
As a South Carolinian neighbor, I appreciate the inclusion of local grocery chains that I can relate to.
yeah citirc acid is awesome,l you eating a soup or sauce from yesterday? sprinkle a few drops in and it tastes fresh. it is also great for yougurts or puddings
I didn't know food lion was exclusive to NC
Mattpat congratulations you
While watching this vid I finished a diet coke lol
B soda.; it's weird to think that someone call soda pop or Cola
I didn't even know Harris Teeter and Food Lion were North Carolina based
Do you believe in God? And are you saved? If so go tell someone else and tell them to tell someone else if not then go read the Bible take Jesus as your saver. If you don't want to then well you don't have to.....
13:30
What happenes to the screen on 13:31?
Impossible
Pop yessir Canada eh
PERFECT MAMA as the caps say. But really have you tried diet water? It's awesome!
the stores that are close to my location too is mildly terrifying and exciting
I interchangeable say soda and pop
I love regular coke
press X to doubt
Thank you matpat. I will now search for this
The other, other other, other thing we know you by is your Catchphrase ‘ that’s just a theory, A GAME THEORY’.
In italy we say "coca"
I've always said coke for anything soda related My favorite coke is Mr.Pibb
Me reading the titel  YOU WHAT!!!!!!!!!
A
dr pepper
Fizzy drink
I guess you need to do a video on 'The secret to immortality in CITRIC ACID'
however i must say, diet coke takes the crown for soda fountain coke. It could just be the uncleaned pipes that dispense it, but it has much more taste than canned / bottled
Where I live Soda is the most broad term.
Boylan birch beer is to die for
Dit Cok
What! Why
Am I the only one who hums mat pats song “fry day” (from the fry food theory episode) on the school bus??
"Food lion" my guy, that's a delhaize picture. But I mean tho, they also called it here in Belgium "De leeuw/Le Lion/The Lion" , but we just say delhaize in general. I didn't know you guys had the similar shop there🙃
It's all Coke, dr. Pepper? Coke. Sprite? Coke. Coke? Coke.
13:30
Glass bottles are the best way, the only way
mr. pibb is pretty good
Sparkling water Costco brand
But you said Marge instead of March from The Simpsons
40 something minutes late and and I can’t comment first
I am a d: other (Brus) its Norwegian
Title: I quit Diet Coke! Me: click bait!!!
profits are down and the price of coke is up
Harris Teeter: I see no god up here other than me. Diet Coke: I used to be god once.
Diet-rite. Iskall didn't like that
*gasp*
I say pop. They usually say it in the north, which is where I’m from
I live in Wisconsin and my mom says pop but I say soda and it infuriates me when my mom says pop
Alright, help me out here. Is my phone weird, or are there a lot of graphical glitches going on in this video?
😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬
Coke
We call it pop over in the UK.
I honestly thought this would never happen.
The end of an Era
WTF
I am very glad to have a Harris teeter near my house now
Has anybody noticed the glitchieness of the video.....it was also in gmm....its not my phone....maybe a lil puzzle?
I'm Canadian, so it's Pop. Coke is for colas.
Gingerail cranberry is the only answer
Mr Patthew, who is your favorite source of diet coke. It is my belief that Mcdonald's has the best fountain Diet Coke, anyone else care to weigh in?
I thought coke and pepsi were going to be the first to fight
Coke all the way!
3:45 turn on ur subtitles
Food lion is just 100m away from my house lmao
MatPat should drink Royal Crown Cola. It’s sold in Delaware and is popular in the southern states. “RC Cola is one half of a working man’s lunch. The other half is a moon pie.” Side note: we’ve got Food Lion all the way up the Eastern Shore US, as far as I can tell
Diet Coke gives me a migraine. I drink Coke Zero.
is this video sponserd by diet coke  😂😂😂
B
Diet coke taste like dirt Zero cole is good
Ok when they do the rock paper scissors it kinda feels like you can see how much of a couple they are. They match each other perfectly so many times 🤣🤣
Soooooo Harris Teeter cheated cause what happened to no extra flavoring!!! Harris Teeter has added citrus acid 👏🏼 so they cheated 👏🏼
C
Wait what
For a North Carolinian based store chain, there’s a food lion in my small town in Georgia. So now I’m a little confused
Matthew Robert Patrick is the only man that can be drunk by the fizzy Diet Coke
I have a Dillon’s in my town. I’m gonna go try their cola flavored soda sometime.
What's up with the camera glitches? I'm not finding any hidden messages or anything, so is it just the cam?
Thanks
I used to drink sam's cola all the time at church. I remember it being really goid.
"We here at food theory do not condone mass consumption of diet coke, despite Matt's ability to drink gallons an hour."
Yay! Very proud you quit diet coke.
Ew. Fountain? You were drinking flat soda after the first 5 minutes. Ew.
I call it soft drink, not native in English though
coke and soda interchangeably
Dr.pepper is superior
Me:*watches video       Me:*drinks sprite*
Stephanie is BACCKKKK
2 part sprite lemon lime and 2 parts water
Aspartame, the main sweetener in so called "DIET" and "0 calorie" sodas is a neurotoxin and you should not ever drink it, Matt.
A die hard fan of diet coke.
“Citric acid is like... the secret ingredient”  Every company from now on: write that down
I keep expecting the "AAAAAAAAND CUT" at the end of the video 😂😂
I drink an overwhelming amount of Coke Zero. I probably have just minutes to live.
I feel like part of MatPats soul will die with Diet Coke like literally hours of content across his channels are just about Diet Coke
Harris teeter vs Diet Coke w a lemon.
Matt legit just wanted to drink a bunch of Diet Cola
Soda but my family always said it soo-d-e. Mom side of the family said it that way. There from Missouri. Then my dad said mostly called it soda(normally) or pop and for the most part they all grow up in California but they moved out to call California in the early 70s they moved around a lot before that.
You know Matt and Stephanie know each other when they consistently tie in rock paper scissors
Well, looks like we got 2 Diet Soda for the Patrick household.
D: Scotland = juice. At best, fizzy juice   👌
Should have thrown in the food lion into the Harris Teeter vs Coke Zero 8D
I saw this and went “Wait, WHAT!” Also, I live in the Midwest and still call it Soda.
You should have had some water too for a palate cleaner.
Matt how dare you betray your Diet Coke brethren. FOR SHAME!!
is there a secret theory in this video that we have to find out or is It just me
Have you thought about cocaine and cocaine accessories?
When doing a taste test, you should drink water to neutralize your taste buds as to prevent flavors affecting samples you taste afterwards.
B unless you count spanish (refresco)
you mad man
Yo I didn't know you were in NC I live just over the va border
My mom calls it “Soder” because she’s a Newyorker and my dad calls it pop because he’s from the south and I couldn’t decide who to take after so I called it popser until I was about 10 and I’ve been calling it soda ever since
B
B
I am probably an A (pop)
i personally really like Coke Zero. Altho i dont drink much cola. The one soft drink i usually prefer is 7UP But its really cool seeing all these brands that you guys have in the US
May I suggest *sparkling water*, it's like pop, yet healthy
Matpat: Me: Impossible  Matpat: does it Me: surprised Pikachu face
Mats detist : Would you do to your teeth Matt: Soda
Give the man a bottle of concentrated TV static, McDonald's Sprite
People ask my family all the time why we say pop instead of soda, and my brother and I would always respond with, "Pop is the sound the bottle makes when you open it. What bottle says, 'Soda' when it opens?"
This is like if game theory stopped talking about fnaf Impossible
Did anyone else see the 4 green lines at 4:07 ? I think it's chaos theory
I think the only reason Mat thinks Harris Teeter is better than Diet Coke is because he’s just sick of Diet Coke at this point
I don’t know if u can get it in America but a lemony drink that I consume by the liter is Pulco
I call it pop cuz I’m from the mid west but sum ppl in my family who r from Boston call it tonic
I lived in Raleigh!
Overcoming diet coke. The biggest achievment matpat has done
this channel has so many layers of jokes it's almost hilariously suffocating
Is that green bar just my computer glitching at 8:10 or is it a new secret code for theorist wear?
noooo the diet coke pat is gone, now it’s harris teeter pat
I don't enjoy pops with caffeine (the taste is just bleh every time), but this made me want to try the Kroger brand here for fun. xD
Ohio gang! We are pop folk!
I thought he was In Los Angeles by north Carolina
Cough syrup without the danger boylan
Future reference for theorists: "MA MA WA" weirdly capitalized in the description. Typing "MAMAWA encoding" in Google refers to an RGB image-based data analysis thing, maybe relevant? Weird color bands glitches all over the video. Strange green horizontal almost glitchy looking stripes. These are the timestamps: 3:04 - 3:05, 1st color bands. 4:05 - 4:06, 2nd color bands. 8:09 - 8:10, 3rd color bands, very visible. 9:42 - 9:43, 4th color bands, very fast. 13:30 - 13:31, 5th color bands, pretty fast. 22:52 - 22:53, 6th color bands. Last one. Spacing between them is a bit odd, but it is all I could find in my 2nd watch and honestly not that big into ARG's. Good luck, hope you all can figure it out.
I get this is Cola, but CheerWine is the always choice for North Carolina.  I lived there for 2 years and CheerWine should be a national treasure.
B: Soda
Wait food lion's only here in nc?- Huh
Diet Mt. Dew FTW!!!
Matt and Stephanie are like a wholesome aunt and uncle.
Macfuddy's Pepper Elixr is the only spicy soda I know, and almost any soda is better than Diet Coke IMO.
15:33 im a other
For future reference, remember to "wash" your palette's between testing to get a more accurate taste of the flavor. Results might be skewed if one of the drinks linger on your palette when you drink another.  It's also the reason why certain dishes can taste better in a certain order, or vice versa. Like, if you eat a super rich and flavorful soup and then try eating another dish, the dish might taste bland because your tongue is still affected by the previous dish.
I’m soft drink
I have heard that Dr. Pepper is the drink for intellectuals.
I have no say here.  I drink soda?  I go all the way!  High fructose corn syrup & unhealthy amounts of caffeine for the win.  No pretending to be healthy for me.  Dr. Pepper is one of my favorites 😋  If Matpat wants to be pretend healthy, he should go all natural.  Real cane sugar and caffeine  ... maybe Jones brand?
Btw I am a Pop guy
i was drinking diet pepsi will watching this
Pepsi 👀👀
*And he's back on the addiction now* Edit: We need a different soda flavors test now, it would be between cola, ginger ale, root beer, and dr.pepper, (maybe sprite).
Steph is right Publix is mainly in Florida
I believe that since Boylan has used the same recipe for the past 100 years, that must mean they use the original method the soda was made in 1891. So maybe that's why it smells like cough syrup/turpentine.  This is just a guess though, I really have no idea.
12:49 I KNEW IT!  Kroger/Gerbes and now I know Harris Teeter is my fix for diet soda.  They have a diet red drop which is EXACTLY like Mountain Dew: Code Red which doesn't even come in diet from Pepsi.  Their Dr pepper Cherry knock off is better than the original too, it tastes like real cherry syrup even though I get diet of that too.
I am a Pepsi fan to the core
Get a Sodastream bruh
it's kind of interesting that the winner is the one with a hint of fruity flavor in it but when you were sourcing up the list you specifically eliminated flavored cola sodas. could it possibly be that your taste buds were so sick of tasting colas at the end of the day that the one with the unique flavor profile stood out more than it would normally?
A. Pop anyone else?
This was an excuse for him to buy aton of diet soda wasnt it
15.30 im: "sodavand" (its danish)
MatPat needs tattoo
His name is Mathew? I always thought it was Matrick Pathew.           I heard them make that joke in a live stream when they were playing Vampyre
Mat Pats best video in a long time.
*pop*
Quitter!
As someone who has acid reflux I can confirm that citric acid runs the world
15:30 c, but when im talking english its soda
I'm pop 😎✌
This is the best episode of food theory i think i was wondering if the diet coke was the best or no i don't think i have a " Haris tetrad" (sorry i don't speak much English so sorry) around me sad.☹️
HI STEPH!!! WE LOVE YOU!
Never knew DC counted as Southeast until you started pointing out grocery stores near me...  I'm having an identity crisis. At the same time, we have Wegmans and Rite Aid, so... maybe it's just the best of both worlds?
I love coke to
Top 10 saddest anime moments
Pop
Drink Mountain Dew, G-fuel, or GAMER SUPPS!! Also you’re the person who got me into drinking Diet Coke why would you stop?
I'm from Canada, we've always called it pop most often. Though I will often call it soda or something else as a small joke since I hear the other ways on TV.
13:30 is a weird glitch?
Here where I live we just call it "soft drinks "
Stevia is definitely an acquired taste sweetener. I actually have used Zevia Cola as a caffeine supply I could drink pretty mindlessly while doing work without feeling too terrible afterwards. Fun fact: Zevia’s used to be brown, but they opted out of using the coloring some years back to better show and market that it was a “healthier choice”, take that as you will.
Top Ten Anime Betrayals
Using fountain vs all can and bottles I feel (I stopped the video here btw) is an unfair advantage to the Diet Coke due to the syrup content meaning better flavor.
0:58 nope, that would be the "simultaneously whipped and nay-nayed" video
Now you're going to tell me that the Krabby Patty's secret formula is citric acid.
I work at food lion in upper East Tennessee!!!
Dr. Pepper should count because it is the ORIGINAL cola. Coke and Pepsi came after.
I love HEB cola.
I have the Soda, but the name is scratched out, but not the ingrediants, there's "Poison, Pizza, litteral Flames, and sewer water"THAT SEEMS SAFE!?!(Note: dis a joke-a)
I work at Publix and it’s fun.
Ive been a super fan of matt for the last 4 years or so. but... the first thing I think about when I think matpat is:''I simultaneously whiped and nae naed!!!''
Anyone catched that glitch at 13:31?
Thats why he named last diet theory a mini theory. And do only i see patern between addiction crystal pepsi and coke?

me: no...we’ve lost him...
So easy diet Dr.Pepper is the best, since Dr.Pepper is the best soda
I guess MatPat won’t be getting his Diet Coke sponsorship anytime soon
Interesting hes learning
B
Your thing has been diet coke for YEARS
The upset of the century!
Soda
Coca-cola had it coming for their awful statement. The war between it and Pepsi is over, there is a clear winner. I drink Pepsi now.
I've had Boylan only a few times and never their cola, but their other drinks were top notch.
i actually work at harris teeter i never knew the diet coke was good
Moxie is where it’s at
Me:OMG!!THIS IS LIKE ME QUITING ART
Google research says Harris Teeter is a subsidiary of Kroger. So I'm going to go and try their Kroger Brand Diet Pop. I hate Diet Coke but this fruity flavor has me so interested
I call it soda
I live in Virginia. We have Food Lion
Fountain drinks hit different
Matpat is no longer a coke bloke. Henceforth he is a teeter touter.
Food Lion are a chain in other states as well
Nothing can beat the nectar of the gods
I’m coke
Interestingly: I was disapointed you didn't have a Big K on the list; becuase it's been consistantly the only store brand where I feel it's sodas are just as good as the name brand, even the harder to nail ones Mtn Dew and Dr. Pepper their versions are virtually identical. So if Harris Teeter is Big K, good going on Big K winning your tourny.
I got a food lion commercial right after it got eliminated about donating to homeless.Mat put food lion out of business 🤣
Why am I rooting for sodas-
I'm team B. soda
diet dr.pepper is the superior drink
Anybody who has saw the green lines please comment me on this post If you see it 3:03
Me at the begining: Oh, this is just click bait.  Me at the end: 👁👄👁
world is chaging
You did that like half a year ago to haha
Me sees the title: "No,no this can not be!"
I saw the title and just went "That is such a lie"
Sorry, but MY allegiance is with the Watchdogs of Farron
Wait, that's illegal
It's just a food theory guys relax, he's not actually quitting... Right???
Hareis teeter soda sales are gonna skyrocket
Are you also gonna change your name from Matthew?!
I put diet coke as more iconic than the jacket tbh
7 months ago: Last Dab Sauce Video  “oh why would i doubt the nectar of the gods”  7 months later  I QUIT Diet Coke!
From utah here, we all call it soda. But, I lived in texas for a while and people down there would sometimes call it soda water
AHHH I USED TO WORK AT HARRIS TEETER
Matt, there is no replacement for diet coke. Diet coke is god. Feel the love. I can tell you for a fact its not Zevia.
Not the diet my baby
Here in Scotland we call it Ginger.
I just drink water.
As a person who has family in the Pacific, Midwest, AND south. They all call soft drinks different names Midwest (and some mountain regions): Pop West: Soda South: coke (idk about New England though)
Stephanie will be so proud, But not NEARLY as much as me 🥲
THERE SHOULD BE MUSIC THEORY
Wait but you drank diet coke in the hot ones theory, which was in 2020.
OOHHHH Kroger Diet Soda is Harris Teeter Soda!? NICE, I'll try buying your Diet Soda to see if it's as tasty as you say~ :D
new food theory what is doctor pepper?
#NotMyMatPat
Comic theory!!!!! Please!!!!! Like who is phantom stranger
Steph and I are on the same wavelength. Coke Zero is my diet soda of choice.
drink water or tea
All soda stream is gaaaaaarbo ... in my opinion
The lesson is move to south carolina
coke
When i saw that title i really said  "SOOO the end is coming "
I don't like the methodology of mixing the source. There should have been a different bracket for each source. Fountains v Cans are an unfair matchup. Especially since fountain drinks can be different per source. Some fountains are set up to change the ratio of syrup to soda.
I don't live in the south but i go for coce
I think I’m other I just think other tastes nice
This was an excellent video. Keep up this great work!
But Canadians all know that PC cola is CLEARLY the best!
I live in South Carolina so the majority of the stores they went to were around my area, except for Harris teeter! I’m going to North Carolina to visit my grandparents soon, maybe I can convince them to get some Diet Coke from there 😂
ONE SHINING MOMENT
We all laughed at the Kroger ad but they managed to end Matpat's diet coke adiction : no one's laughing now
I need you guys to do whether quotation organic food and quotation is healthier than non-organic food / GMO food. Thanks appreciate it
Bababoi
sams cola is really bad my dad bought it once and it was disgusting
My personal favorite soda is Ruby Red Squirt
I’m definitely a soda man
water
@mattpat have you tried diet coke or coke zero with a squeeze of lemon....I bet it tastes as good if not better than the harris teeter diet soda...
It’s Soda for me. I can at least understand Pop, but calling everything Coke is heresy, and frankly I’m insulted.
I had a feeling Kroger was going to be behind Harris Teeter because watching GMM has taught me much but one thing is that  Kroger brings that heat with it's store brand stuff!
She is so offended Xd
I’m from Ohio, and it’s soda
Hope it's cola light  Edit: it's not available where I live :(
It would have helped if you included the ingredient list in the video.
It's Soda.  Ya weirdos :p
Steph's here thinking her husband got replaced by someone else
Love to see the VA/NC repping going on in this eppisode
12:30 anyone see that flash thing?
Anyone else see that blip at 13:31? Bunch of bars of yellow and various blue colors. Simple video error, or is he playing some long game with a new ARG?
Here at 50m and it already has 23k likes
13:31 hidden lore in a coke video?
That rock off is how yk they live together lol
3:46 *SUS*
Soda
3:45 omg mat pat said bad word!!!!!!!!
D: other. Soda pop
Uk, I call it Coke.
I’m a läsk guy myself
Just watched history being made
I'm starting to think matpat like diet coke more then stephanie
I’m going to King Soopers today to try this
Wait they live in North Carolina? I’m on vacay in SC- but anyway dang I really with they’d try Pibb Xtra, best soda ever 👍
I'm slightly disappointed to see you quit Diet Coke
Growing up we called soda cold drink but more like "Cole-drink".
This title caught me off guard lmfao
Might i suggest seltzer? no calories no guilt!
Cherry coke!
coke for me
matpat: I QUIT Diet Coke! Me: I get Matpat
well i know where to start off if i ever decide to do this for myself lol!! except for you pepsi, get outta here, you give me headaches.
Mom can we get Diet Coke  Diet Coke at home:diet sams
As someone who knows grocery stores I can tell you Florida is different from the southeast of the United States
I'm an Ohioan and say soda
I’m a Pepsi kinda guy Coke never heard of it
GASP! Harris Teeter the Cinderella Story winner! :D
No sound
LET'S GOOOOOO HARRIS TEETER
finally done with the aspartame o see
Is Harris Teeter big enough to sponsor this channel?
Yeah, gotta get rid of that racist coke
Matpat no replacing one addiction with another is wrong.
How dare you drink the holy grail of sodas with a straw!
Nice underdog story
Mat: other stores Me: *sad europe noices*
9:15 This would have been perfect to place a breaking bad reference
B. Soda
MATPAT I DARE YOU TO GO 5 Episodes and Drink Diet Mountain Dew or Diet Sprite. Like and comment if you agree that he should just to see if he grows on it
Food lion is a Belgian company(or at least founded in Belgium)
Have always called it soda. At one point I was with someone from the midwest and we argued between pop and soda XD Also it is INSANE that the one filler slot actually won
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This episode brought to you by MatPat’s diet soda withdrawal
We here in Iowa are all about the POP
I love how you say Kroger and Frys are two different entities haha, even though Frys is just kroger but just a different name since they are all over the country just under different names.
great test but I cant eat diet so the zero sugars would have to win for me
NOOOO-
Wait, is MatPat really just doing a Rank-King episode? *Eugene Lee Yang would like to know your location
4:06
Does no one say sode-pop but me?
Coke
ah man I call soft drinks by name and if not then I call it soda
In (India) bengali language "Shasta" means "Cheap", soo......😅😅
What?!? (My dad drinks olny coke, he hate diet coke! And I hate him)
POP
Hey Matt Pat got a test for you what is the best sauce to dip your chicken in like can’t go wrong with ketchup classic barbecue or is there no sauce or is it something unique like the sauce one sauce or whatever was that Mulan sauce that’s what mcds had. or is it better just to eat them plain
Down here we call it diabetes juice
MatPat: I quit Diet Coke!  Everyone: *IMPOSSIBLE*
In South Africa we call soda, Cool Drink😂
This reminds me of my mom's raging Dr. Pepper addiction. Right now she has like over 20 two leter future appointments with Dr. P in our dining room
She is dead wrong about the south calling every soda a coke. We call em soft drinks around here. Usually people out west call em coke and Yankees say pop
U can still get coke life? In UK it went like years ago.
Expect Harris Teeter Diet Coke sales to rise up❗️ YouTube butterfly effect😅👍🏽
3:46 okay Matt patt I didn’t that that’s what u were into
Diet Coke should have tried to Sponsor MatPat.
If you’re looking for root beer, boylan’s birch beer tastes a little different than your typical root beer but gets better as you drink more
I live in north Carolina
It's pop mah dude
the fact that they live in nc,,,  and i live in nc so weird lol
Btw guys, in the intro if you blink on beat is looks super cool
I'll take the Coke Zero but I have noticed that if I drink too much of it, the soda irritates my stomach.  Oh, and I'm from the South so sodas are called "Cokes."
Mr coke diet became Mr Harris Teeter
none of those brands are in my country :-(
nooooooooooooooo
B
We actually have some food lions in virginia
Surely you would chose the same starting receptacle eg all can or bottle?
Switch to cola zero
Me drinking Diet Pepsi: interesting
soda
It's interesting. I live in Germany and here it's very common to buy the store brand in discounters and I knew already that a lot of discounters sometimes get even the same products as brands, but sell it under a different name. So this video probably wasn't that surprising for me as it might be for other people. :D
I still ship Matpat and Diet Coke
Harris teeter after this video: business is booming
Sodavand
I grew up on Big K pop. I don't think there is a bad variety.
A: pop  Idk it was easier to aay
Never seen a soda bottle that big in my life!
I’m British and I was raised calling it pop but I’m not sure if that’s just a northern thing
Diet Bunderburg ginger beer enough said.
Why did he do it why Mathew Patrickson WHYYYYYYYYY
LMAO gotta love the Publix representation. As native who grew up in the southeast it took me WAY too long to realize that Publix was a regional company :’D
Please come to Aruba
the knowledge he has on the taste of coke is somewhat worrying
Haven’t seen it yet but, did you hit your head Mat Pat?
I actually know Food Lion because I lived in Tennessee. LOL
We use Coke as our catch-all soft drink term
i was surprised it wasnt one of those diet coke kills or something
I drank Diet Coke for the first time because of Matpat and basically became addicted to it. Watching matpat betray Diet Coke makes me mildly uncomfortable.
Im waiting for the review comments from people in the US who will try the local diet Cola (Can't do that myself xD, I don't live there)
Who loves diet coke  Mat Pat loves diet coke is it true
Kroger Cola does roll off the tongue pretty nice.
YOU GOT TO TRY SHASTA SODA IN WASHINGTON STATE IT JUST TASTE BETTER
I think why all of the classics lost because many big names (especially diet coke) has change so much over the years. But then again I can't drink diet sodas without feeling sick.
he just wants to drink pop
NO
I'm looking forward to the future Citric Acid episode;)
I’m British and I was raised calling it pop but I’m not sure if that’s just a northern thing
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, MATPAT IS DEAD
EASILY a soda guy.  This was even more educational than I thought it would be
Matpat: I quit Diet Coke. Me: impossible...  Edit: B. Soda Gang. I’ve never heard of someone who calls all cola coke.
No way Matpat your quitting on Diet Coke?
Fry’s closed ☹️
no way
The look of shock on Steph's face when he he liked Harris Teeter better than diet coke... Dayum
You know that that it’s sincerely funny when MatPat pulls out his dolphin laugh. Twice.
I‘m German and it‘s Kola lol.
wait... if citric acid is what changes these thing for the better... what if citric acid is the crabby patty secret formula?
aspartame overload
nooo the end of the world
Us up here in the great North call it #pop
A lot of people probably known Food Lion from Mr. Beast
Pepsi fans: Where Pepsi?
Nooooooooooooooooooooo :((((((
anyone else get a green flash on there screen at around 13:29 to 13:31
I prefer fanta.
YOU HAVE A SODA STORE
oooooo fountain being their Diet Coke contender is dangerous, since it varies wildly between different founts
Saw the title quit diet Coke me mat pat brand is.  Dead
:O
B is my OG pick
Idea for Food Theory: Can eating spinach make you strong like Popeye?
I never thought this day would come
Soda
I saw the title and was like: NOOO GOD NOOOOO DON'T DO THIS PLEASE GOD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
drinking diet stuff is so sickening to me... tastes like puke...
NOOOOOOOO
I personally don't think diet soda in any form is healthy for anyone. It's worse than normal soda, because of all the fake Industrial factory made sugars in there. I prefer real sugar, and stivia leaf extract.
Diet Dr Pepper dude!!!!!
Top 10 anime- uhh I mean soda betrayals
my favorite soda is actually diet coke lol
I've personally never had the diet version but Stubborn has some pretty solid cola/coke soda. It's supposed to be a little more natural than other big name sodas. I've never seen the bottles or cans but I have seen the fountain versions of it :)
As a truck driver, I can confirm that a lot of differently labeled items come from the same place.
Coke is the best
did anyone else see the weird green effect at 4:05? Probably nothing and I'm probably looking to much into it but idk
Praise the diet mountain dew gods
Soda
I'm one to say "pop" when referring to that sort of carbonated drink
You seriously think fountain diet coke is better? Are you high?
PESIPPPPPPPPP
May I introduce you to bepis Mr theory person?
Book theory
Pepsi best
nobody: Me only knowing matt from the boob episode:👁👄👁
Am I the only one who sees green lights throughout the video? Like in 18:17 for example
I AM jarritos NOT SODA OR POP OR COKE
Born and Raised in Wester Colorado and everyone I know says Pop. Also disappointed we didn't get to see your shocked reactions to the last part of the first round. Wonder if there wasn't audio or something?
Im here in Alabama and no one I know calls every soda brand Coke. Its soda.
WHAT!!!
MatPat is no longer MatPat
i like Fanta but that's probably because I'm a kid and I like sugary soda that has like 20 grams of sugar
Pls don't say 'oh G'
Sadly no diet double cola on the contenders list.
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I questioned every single thing in life wondering, is the world going to end or something for Matt to say I’m quitting Diet Coke!? The nectar of the gods!?
Seems like my recommended section is trying to tell me something
Did Matpat move from California?
B
ok
Soda
North Carolina has really good cola, I prefer the food lion stuff but Harris teeter is good Also, what the actual heck I share a state with mat pat???
I never thought I'd see the day...
Go Coke Zero I haven’t finished it yet
man, i loved this tournament arc
This channel went from posting food related science to Matt just having fun and i enjoy it
I quit Diet Coke for Coke zero
15:32 refri
In MD we call it soda. MD has a bit of an identity crisis of being a northern/southern state. Also wanted to let you know about Virgil’s zero sugar cola. My boyfriend is diabetic and he loves their zero sugar root beer. We can get Virgil’s products at Target and Food Lion. Other than that try to but it via Amazon at least to try it out.
We came for the MArch Madness, but stayed for the rock-paper-scissors
Make a theory about how harmful is diet coke or normal coke
1:09
This episode has so much arg stuff in it.
You forgot McDonalds Diet Coke!
Go with Diet Pepsi instead! Screw Coke! :D That or one of the many Mt. Dews instead. Major Melon just came out. I could go on. I'm serious.
Washington here, it's "Soda" or "Pop", sometimes "Soda Pop"; if you're a child or adult with kids, it can also be "Sody Pop"
4:04 camera glitch
:o
Fun facts: In Quebec, we refer to soft drinks as liqueurs (liquors). (Google it if you want the pronounciation)
Yes Matt pat
Pop comes from Faygo Pop, from Michigan. They switched to metal lids on their glass bottles and they decided to call it pop after the sound the lids made when removed.
Pop
Pop! (from England)
You ever had faygo?
Always called it soda where I'm from in Canada
But that red jacket does be looking fine tho...
*cries*
To me this is a pointless debit because ummm...... I don’t like cola
While I prefer Coke Zero I will drink any sugar-free pop at a restaurant without a fuss but I am AMAZED at MatPat's conclusion here! MatPat quitting Diet Coke is the final square on my apocalypse bingo card!!
This is the beginning of a character arc
Tisk tisk. You all forgot to include the god of all grocery stores: H-E-B.  If you know, you know.
I live in the baltic states and say cola but in another language
I was shocked becuase 9f the video title
NOOOOOOOOOOO
Watch someone from any of these cola company’s gather new ideas to improve their drinks
Me: *Sees title* "Blasphemy! MatPat without his Diet Coke?!, He's been replaced by an animatronic!"
I just call sodas by their brand name
I'm surprised Food Lion made it as far as it did.
I'm as shook as Steph is lol
Not a produced one but you can buy syrups then have seltzer water and it tastes good
just drink normal coke, that'd be my suggestion
How is no one talking about their faces at 9:38-
It’s all Coke bb
Understand im going to post ASPARTAME EVERY EPISODE UNTIL YOU DO 1 ON IT
You live in NC?!?!?!
You are the exact opposite of my mom. She used to live in NC and now lives in Ohio. She hates diet stuff, and I like you a lot
what are the green lines on screen? #9:43 and earlyer
It's POP because that is the sound it makes when you open a can or when the bottle releases the pressure
I grew up in the north then moved to the south and it confused me for a while 😃
evrery food comapany has too shuv food down are skulls
My drink of choice is coke zero. I have a extreme addiction
*sees title* IMPOSSIBLE!
Wait Food Lion is only in North Carolina man man the more I learn. Also I only lived in North Carolina so that explains it
Did anyone see the glitch      In the episode
#flipaclip lol
Other, I'm other. as I grew up with soda pop and coke.. lol the moment you said harris teeter was a subsidiary of a larger place I went, I bet its Kroger.   and yep it was Kroger.  Thier brand is actually seriously solid. I highly recommend thier store brand mac and cheese. and the icecream often tastes better than many of the bigger brands.
Me checks notifications  Notifications I quit diet coke Me WHAT NO
I'm not pop, soda nor coke, I'm kind of a "refri" guy.  No, I'm not from  USA
Wow mad Pat I can't believe you quit drinking diet coke I guess wow that this is a surprising to me
I can't tell if it is "I QUIT Diet Coke" or "I QUIT Diet Coke"
Pop for life baby
13:31 ??
Pepsi max ginger is the only kind of cola i drink. I dont drink it often either
20:56 Stephany mind blown
In Ecuador we call all sodas: cola
Fun fact competitive swimming also does March madness
I now need a food theory that explains why citric acid makes things so much better lmao
With the sodastream I think you carbonated it too much. You only need to press once Or it becomes like bitter almost. But if you get it right it's kinda descent I guess EDIT:OK i watched more and I really wasn't expecting that. No spoilers tho
Diet soda is accually according to my science teacher worse for you than normal soda
I saw the title and thought it was a rick roll
Lies, deception
Boyaland’s best pop in my opinion is the root beer
I’m sorry for your loss
did i read the title correctly-
3:48 subtitles
so can I just say, I love Steff's top? I want one! ok back to the cola match off!!!
I'm starting a citris cult whos in
Ginger pop
A and b
I never thought this day would come...
Finally done - one question - you excluded from the rankings all FRUIT FLAVORED diet colas - no cherry or lime or anything.  So, a diet cola with citric acid won.  I wonder if other fruit flavored colas would have shown better?  Good episode.   I'll stick with Diet Coke.
Diet Coke: et tu MatPat
other:koula
I am now questioning my identity
We're pop around where I'm from
🤔 just switch to water.. I stopped drinking soda and eat grapes and oranges because they sweet. And gives me my sugar high without needing soda
No
Put captions one here and uh hmmm 3:45 😅
I’m by a Publix in Florida right now. Wow.
We have foodlions in west Virginia
There's a strange glitch at around 13:32
Yeah, like I would believe that.
U wot m8?
Make a video about cooking the FNAF pizza according to the ingredients that the game shows
In Australia we Say soft drink
This was like old GT Live! I loved it!
(Sees title) who are you and what have you down with the real mat
Matpat, Florida is basically its own country.
Boylans diet root beer is really good their cola tho..... no thanks 😂
And I'll see you all ne-
I’m just now realizing how close they live to me
I feel out of place being from NC and NOT calling everything Coke, I'll have a soda please. Coke Zero is the substitute in our house
You should have kept the identities of the colas until the end - you could add the drama in the edit
A good coke here in Germany is friz cola 😀.
Coke 3
I thought I was enjoying this video and then I heard MatPat say "Top Pop." I can't wait to see what his next channel will be about.
I am a "Soda" guy. That is what I call it.
I am in the OTHER bracket when it comes to what I call a soft drink. I was born in NJ. Lived in KY and OH and now will probably die in WV. I call a soft drink what it is. IE: I'd like a Mountain Dew or I'll have a diet coke. I use the soft drinks brand name.
Best is Baikal drink. Take it or leave it.
So for everyone outside America, it's a coke landslide.  Edit:  Made this sippin diet coke
Soda
Oh hey, I didn't know you lived in NC!  Howdy Neighbor!
I am other, i come from a spanish speaking island and we call them "Refresco", which translates to... "refreshed"????
“I quit Diet Coke” -Panik *Diet Coke makes it to the finals -calm *Matpat still chooses Teeters -PAniK
Oh my god I actually can't believe he picked something that WASN'T diet coke
I like diet coke as my favorite taste but prefer pepsi max as my absolute favorite because it's the most affordable in my area (I also prefer cans in both cases (diet coke is on average double price to pepsi max here
What about glass bottle Diet Coke
I say 'soda.' 'Pop' has too many other meanings and 'Coke' is too specific.
I’m Batman
***SPOILERS***   Sounds like it was a good thing he didn't get that diet coke sponsor.
Cokellette, instead of rose you pour a cup of it 😂
I saw that title and thumbnail and part of my childhood just died
there's some glitching at certain points in the video. 13:30 for example
what about CO2 mixed with sugar and H2O
Next time on food theory: American colas tackle canadian colas
ppop
When Harris Teeter invented Diet Coke
(not watched yet but) you can't do this to me mat i just recently acquired my own diet coke addiction edit: soda for life
I am from the most northern part of Virginia and I say soda.
Soda here in Oregon, though saying Pop or Soda-pop won't get you any odd looks. Asking for a Cola will get you a Coca-Cola
COKE ZERO REPRESENT!!!! I live in Canada so I can’t try that store brand, but Coke Zero was the kind that I was rooting for and it got basically first so!!
Diet sodas have gotta be the most disgusting drinks on the market
I know someone that works at Boylan Heritage
We have food lion here in TN lol.
Cheerwine is good, even if its not "Cola flavored".
Confirmed Matt lives in North Carolina...
I'm just happy to see Steph on screen after that GT Live LiveStream. Yeesh, way to make a guy sad lmao
Here in The Netherlands we call it Cola.
Next march We do other soda type Regular coke, dr.pepper, rootbeer, or sprite
The draught details coke is most likely sweeter as the system was set to be served with ice. It increases the sweetness as you can taste it less the colder something is. Bottled and canned coke aren't as sweet because they will warm up quicker
Sweet tea
As an avid Diet Cola drinker as well, I just wanted to mention that I only like Coke Zero over Diet Coke when Coke Zero is cold.
Just going to say in the South if we say we want a "Coke" it means we want a Coke.. if we want something different we ask for it by name
Want to know mine favorite COKE and pepsi is just a general fav but there's a specific coke that is mah favorite IS!!!- Wait a second...Only if you really want to know if so just replie to this comment (and I'm from italy so mine english is not that good)
Aspartame hasn't been linked conclusively to any specific health problems, other than for people with phenylketonuria (PKU).
No, Impossible, IMPOSSIBLEEEEE
Finally! Sodas are unhealthy af and also wastes a lot of water
I read the title and just went WHAT cause matpat and diet coke go together like rama lama lama ka dinga da dinga dong
Nonsense.
It’s pop for me woooo go midwest lol
PUBLIX
U know Matpat gotta do a citric acid theory now.
All I drink is normal coke no joke
Cherry fanta
Ok so we need to spam coke to replace their acid with citric acid.
Diet coke is fucking disgusting.
Diet coke and 0 calories? X for doubt.
My mom is sugar free, and we experiment with a lot of things. Not thinking of soda, using maple syrup as a sweetener is a LOT better the stivea. This is what we use for home made pies, ice cream, and whip cream.
D: Fizzy Drink.
b
targibald
We call it fizzy drinks over here in the UK
Did anyone else see that @ 13:31????
my dad went to NC with my grandfather and got Harris teeter cola. it was actually really good. food lions exist in South Carolina too
Why aren't you cleansing your palate between tastes?
Sadly he probably won't ever do an episode on aspartame which would be more important
BREAKING NEWS: Matpat stop drinking diet coke
13:31 is this a test?
Me seeing the title: Nani?!
Harris teeter is the main character
A
i call it cool-drink
Matpat: UGH I HATE IT I HATE IT also Matpat: takes another sip
B: Soda
was it me who saw a green line
Good going Matt glad you kicced that filthy habit of drinking diet coke
Best drink. Water
NC BROS !!!!!
My favourite is Coke 0
i live in the middle east and we call it soft drinks
What's with the flickering lights in the video?
I live in the west and we have a Smith's. I think that our Harris Teeter is Big K!
Rip diet Coke *insert beginning year of diet Coke*-2021
Did y'all take into account where the drinks were bottled? Coca-Cola bottles Sam's Cola for example.   Just asking for a friend.
I'm a C guy from NC. I think since he's in NC, he should try Sundrop. Also I'm a little upset he didn't try RC Cola
"I just simultaneously whipped and nae naed!"
Shasta cola.  That one beats em for me.  Otherwise we are talking sugarcane cokes made in Mexico.  Oh wow just amazing!
8:10 there are some green marks that go by as steph says it smells like turpentine, is that a camera error or some weird cypher?  Edit: Happens again by 13:30
Why don't you guys mix the three winner drinks together and see what is better, I love mixing drinking of soda and yeah I am weird but it is fun when I was a child, still do it XD like coke and  pepis together
Bro I live in the south east and where I live we call it soda
Whrich is better? Water from sink or Water from shops
I didn't know that Pepsi Max is called Pepsi zero sugar cola in the us
Pop
Stephanie says Matthew like a disappointed mother does at times lol
something else... also is soda pop the unholy hybrid?
Artificial sweeteners can only be derived from pee. Therefore Diet Coke has pee in it. Should it be safe to drink? Get on this food theory,
What's with the glitchiness. It may just be the aesthetic but it's really off-putting.
You're an addict. So become addicted to something else
In the UK its a fizzy drink
ah yes fry's selling coke
In New York we all call it soda
I live in Oklahoma. Its called Soda Pop, Soda or Pop, all synonymous rofl
Lol WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATPAT?  Jk guys it was a joke.  For real, it’s good to drop the Diet Coke addiction
Man, the winning cola REALLY could've sponsored this tho
Wait...is it April fools day?!? 1:12 Wait...Matt gave up Diet Coke for 2020?!?!?!? ...a LITTLE unhealthy??? 2:50 ...I think you should have a root beer episode...maybe in a year or two? 3:20 Guess where Matt lives, then hit this link. 15:30 I call it "soda" or sometimes "soda pop". "Coke" is a particular flavor. That would be like saying you want a chocolate bar, when in reality you want fruit roll-ups. 15:54 A close call. 18:00 That is a strong tie. You should have a double elimination with Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Harris Teeter, and Food Lion. 23:56 a new version of an old meme.  ...1 year later and he has said recently that he has not actually given up diet coke.
Diet root beer is my favorite drink
E
16:34 I know it's not Diet; but as someone that Worked at Dr. Pepper Bottling for near a YEAR the product going into Dr. Pepper cans and Dr. [K/P (store brands)] is the SAME. I literally watched Dr. Pepper go into Store brand cans.
Taste stevia may lose but you won’t get a heart attack drinking it :)
If you have save a lots near you their diet cola is cheap and decent replacement.
I honestly prefer Pepsi Max
Your telling me the best channel on youtube is made right here in NC.. whoop whoop
see you should have excluded diet coke seeing that is what you are trying replace
Impossible
This is concerning
Why didn't you run the tests with Matt and Steph separated and blind to which sodas were going into each round?
I can't believe matt patt is living in MY home state!
Nächstes Mal Bier testen! (Next time beer testing!)
Never thought I’d see the day
PUBLIX #1
Personally, I like the Diet Coke Caffeine Free. Don't know why…
A:pop
B. Soda. Coming from the Pacific Northwest
citric acid is actually the secret ingredient of the crabby patty formula
Fun fact: diet soda is actually worse for your health than non-diet soda for one simple reason: the artificial sweetener, aspartame. Aspartame is, in fact, worse for you than plain old sugar! If you want to get healthy without quitting soda altogether, avoid diet soda like the plague.
Here in england we call it FIZZY DRINKS
I'm a Pepsi light  addict anddd B:
Citric acid episode coming when?
And I used to love Stevia Coke, when I could still get it 🤣🤣🤣  Also "Cool drink"
I live in Virginia and we have food lions. I thought it was more popular.
Iced tea gang?
Pop
The world is ending all time rifts have opened all realities combined and now the world will tear its self apart
soda
I usually just say "drink" but on occasion I'll say soda or coke. Also, I agree, Stevia is a big no thank you!
Mat Pats dream has come true diet coke as a business expense tax wright off. I also know Food Lion because they own the company that I work for. They are a German company.
who are you and what have you done with matt pat
Zevia is a soda i commonly drino
I'm a regional of Kroger stores and their lines of sodas are above the rest even on Coke/Pepsi level
Only a great couple can tie on RPS that many times
Make senku cola irl
It was meant to be
diet coke is my second favorite drink   i like ketchup more
c
Diet coke sales went down at least 10 percent
#matpatisthebest
I’m happy ur quitting ur addiction but man I’m gonna miss the Diet Coke memes and jokes
ode, to being a canadian
Isn't diet worse for you than regular soda
soft drink
4:04 Green bars???????
Ngl I LOOOOVVVVEEEEE Fanta with root beer u need more root beer in the cup than the Fanta btw and not too much FANTA.
`ˆ`
Impossible
so he dropped all pretenses of not making pure clickbait, can't wait for his top five life hacks over loud stock music
DRINK SPRITE
Sooo what's the theory here
Washingtonian here, It is a soda
wat is with the random colors throughout the vid
thats interesting... you and also critical had that weird green glitch on your latest vid... 8:09
Tell me I'm not the only one who paused at that colour glitch at 13:31 to see if it was a secret message lol.
When I was little back in Massachusetts it was D. Tonic. However, as an adult it's soda :)
soda
How long did you spend about idea?
pepsi zero sugar? you mean pepsi max right
Why wasn't Royal Crown Cola included?
I think he should switch to regular soda
I've lived in Texas all my life and call it soda... Using Coke to universally refer to all soft drinks is stupid.
While it's good to not want to drink your calories, that really is the least of your worries when drinking brown sodas. Also, your testing method is flawed. Studies have shown that the human brain, when told two things should be different, will find/create differences that dont actually exist (specifically the experiment of having a room full of people judge the quality of something, then being brought the exact same item again and being told it's a similar brand. The people found difference that couldn't possibly exist.) The flaw here is the question being asked, there's an unproven assumption that soda in different forms (ie can vs bottle vs fountain vs brand vs diet vs generic, etc...) WILL be different from each other. No control testing for this was done before having the competition.
We have food lions and harris teeter  here as well and we are like....9 ish 10 hours from NC
you missed tesco og cola
But I sometimes like pop
soda
Pop. I'm from the midwest
I call it Pop and I hate Coke Zero. My family loves it. I drink Diet Coke.
Drink Coca Cola
Some studies in recent years suggest that heavy consumption of artificial sweeteners can contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Truly, just strange times we're living in...
I call it soda
20:54 *Stephanie looks so betrayed LMAO*
the phone guy musical guy tries an alternative for coke
sees title: *thanos imposible meme*
do cherry zero suger coke
Is it bad I knew which diet coke was which by how they described them?
IBC ROOTBEER
Dislikes are from the coke-cola company
#ilovematpat
Its too good of a title for me not to click
MatPat you were the chosen one
Soda. I hate that “coke” doesn’t mean cola down here.
Mat is the whole reason I drink diet coke
What a dark day for theory
NO, BOYLAN MAKES GOOD DIET SODAS. You are just not drinking it correctly. Get it at Rustic Bakery with a chocolate croissant and bacon, then you can talk, not in some plastic cup. As someone who has had Boylan as a part of their child-hood, I am highly offended by this content of anti-Boylan propaganda.
You traitor!!! How dare you disrespect diet coke! I'll get the lynch mob ready.
1 Hour gang. Also WHAT?!?!?!?
This channel is totally different from the channels but I love it
any soda that come in a glass  bottle has the better flavor
It feels like watching BTLive and food theorists
*the simulation is crumbling*
HOPEFULLY YOU FIGUIRE OUT IF IT'S SAFE TO DRINK ITTTTTTTT
But how is this a theory?
That intro. Nice
Soda
Soda.
It's soda-pop all day here
Now he can clame all that soda as business expenses
I’m sorry we don’t have coke, is pepsi okay?
Finally
Soda
as a Wal-Mart employee, Wal-Mart brands are basically the same as name brands just labeled differently for when the bottling plant made more than what was ordered. so like when coke or Pepsi makes more than what was ordered from the warehouse they put the Sam's cola label on it.
Definitely B: for me I live in Colorado
Citric acid, glutamate (in its variety of forms/names) and xanthum gum (and other thickening factors) really are EVERYWHERE  The magic trio of the food industry
matt: puts fountain soda in braket  Me: FOUNTAIN!!! 🤢🤮🤮🤮
YOU MUST MAKE A VIDEO ON IT SO YOU AND EVERYONE ON YT KNOWS TO NEVER DRINK DIET SODA
Lived in the south my entire life WHO TF CALLS PEPSI, COKE 15:25
I want someone to look at me the way Stephanie looks at Matpat 😂
And Harris Teeter stocks will go WILD in 3...2....
I dont like diet sodas but for me i cant taste difference in coke zero and diet coke.
My family always called it ‘soda-pop’ which I have literally never heard anywhere else. I high school I specifically made the choice to call it soda just so I could talk about it without getting weird looks
i live in virginia and theres a food lion right next to my house/work love food lion
I'm a soda person because I'm in California
Coke
B
Coke Zero is bay
“you’ve probably never heard of food lion" when you watch nascar you hear it all the time
Would I get sued into oblivion if I made a cola called “Nuka Cola”? What about Sunset Sarsaparilla?
*sees title*  NANI?!!
I’m already addicted to your channels and THEN to all a sudden realize you’re in NC makes me even more of a fan!!!!!
Wow they put FOUNTAIN into the bracket??? XD
I was swiggly molly pop kinda fellow
I refer to it as soda. I actually lived a lot of my childhood in michigan so I heard everyone saying "pop" and I also lived in Florida for an extended period of time and heard "coke" all the time. I stuck with soda and probably always will
Water: i am good
DON'T DRINK DIET ANYTHING
Turn on captions: 3:46
Probably should just quit diet soda altogether. Drink the real stuff or quit soda altogether.
Has he finaly started to help his addiction  good for him
SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!!
It was the worst when I grew up in the south knowing soda as coke but when I moved to the north east and I asked for a coke.... and I got a coke... I was super disappointed... I wanted a dr.pib.
Nectar of the gods beaten by the underest dog?
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
I live in Virginia and Food Lion and Harris Teaters are everywhere
It’s weird how in America they call it soda but in Ireland we call it fizzy drinks
MAT THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU NEEED
I always called it pop here in Canada. Everyone on the internet always thought it was weird. Glad I'm not alone!
I SAW THIS AND NOW I"M PANICKING SO HARD THE WORLDS GONNA END
Just get one of those carbonators, then you can make any soda you want. Milk soda. Or water soda.
The best Cola is Pepsi Max, it isn't too sweet, has a lot more flavour than other stuff, and is very satisfying to drink. I don't drink it too often though because it is more expensive than other soft drinks.
Friendship ENDED with Diet Coke  Now Harris Teeter is my new best friend
Oh wait he lives in NC? I thought he lived in CA. Hm.
Ima have to try that Harris teeter Diet Coke I live close to one too
I saw the title and thought it was april fools...
not to sound hipster, but... generally liked/ popular drinks and food is more 'middle of the road' with flavor. because they are trying to get a larger audience. never go for a big brand, it's not as good as some random off brand, 9 times out of ten.
Diet coke
DON'T DRINK SODA!!!! Get the sparkly drinks from Walmart. I forget what the brand is called, but its the knock off Walmart brand and there is a cream sickle kind that is REALLY good!
I didn't know Matt was in NC. I guess i thought he was in cali cause I saw him at a grump show years ago lol
Food theory: *makes a video of quiting die coke* Me: thanks i hate it
THIS IS SO SAD
Why is no one talking about the weird glitch at 13:31
But hey thats just a theory a food theory!
Coke: S... Pepsi must done a number on him... Pepsi: Nope, but we need to do something about it...
I'm Läsk, because I grew up in Sweden.
what about canada ontario
I'm just going to get the cheapest one and add citric acid
Here where I live in the UK I say fizzy drink but some people say pop
Wait you guys live in NC too? That’s awesome NC gang
I am hurt and proud at the same time
ok but i LOVE the sans is ness meme/theory.
foodlion represent
Even in the south and midwest, everybody called it Soda. Pop is what you call your dad.
Impossible
How is Florida the Southwest if it isnt even in that ordinal direction
He left out the glass bottle coke
Ooooh you should do a mixology episode that has to deal with citric acid. Since that’s always a main ingredient in all mixed cocktails. You should take a mixology class and do some experiments to make the perfect drink. Even the perfect rum and Diet Coke.
Soda got talent
I thought that he choose diet coke again, not harris teeter
Everything down here in Texas is Coke lol
I was really hoping this would be an episode about how unhealthy sodas (both diet and regular) are. Well, at least they gave a brief disclaimer.
Diet coke does not have any diet. Sure, the sugar amount might be a bit lower, but it is still extremely bad for you.
I live near a fred meyer...Maybe I'll check it out.
Plot twist: MatPat is mad he never got sponsored
So this is how you got to have soda for a vid
*WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATPAT!?*
I call coke cocaine to get a kick outta my siblings
WHAT
My dad drinks Zevia all the time lol
fizzy drink bro
No palate cleaner between drinks. Bracket is void.
Ima Diet Pepsi man my self
Dr pepper and Coke classic are all i need
In the UK we def call it more "Fizzy" then soda or anything else
Pop, 100%
I just went to North Carolina and I visited a food lion in Greensboro or Charlotte and it was a nice store. Reminds me of a Bushes in MI
Harris Teeter has such good subs
Been waiting for this since you started the channel
I use the term soda the most.
13:31
Who are you and what have you done with fatpat.
I still think you should drink Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke because it’s “healthier” for you. It has less sugar and I think less chemicals. Or at least it doesn’t have whatever artificial stuff they put in the Diet Coke.
21:50.... those words hurt me
Where is the outtake with all the burps
Mat pat quits Diet Coke   Diet Coke loses 60% of there profits
Diet Rite sounds like an Eastern church's calorie free approach to worship
Is Pepsi zeros Pepsi Max??
Senku cola, not even joking. I've made it on my own and it's good if you make it right.
My mom says soda and my dad was pop so I grew up saying “soda pop”
Pls make more of these food testing videos. This video is just great
It can't be... This... this is impossible
What is that flash at 13:31??
I’m a soda man
(looks at all the Kroger brand stores)  Nope...none of those in Minneapolis...
Cough Syrup. South Park.
its soda and Coke for me, I lived in Texas for a long time so the coke thing just stuck
Me when seeing title: FINALLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN LIKE DRINKING DIET COKE!  Me when watching video: It wasn't a death, it wasn't a death at all . . . It was an upgrade!
As someone who seldomly drinks soda, I often forget how many brands of it exist.     'Murica!
I feel like he just wanted to drink all that Diet Coke (Soda) to make up for 2020
Kroger is next to my house
8:09 start puzzle solving, friends!  I’m an editor so even a few frames of weirdness catches my eye  It happens again at 13:30  There was also distortion in the mythical kitchen video this morning, and one more video (see the replies on this comment)
I'm a man of culture. A pop man.
I'd be interested to see the international version of this.
Diet coke just lost a huge source of revenue...
Boyland soda is very good. A bit more expensive.  I prefer it over the sweetness of Pop Shop.
In Belgium we have a lot of foodlions but we call it Delhaize. So weird to see that the same grocery store in other country also exist with the same logo but with an other name. Now I'm curious to know if the diet coke of foodlion is the same as the delhaize one in Belgium.
texas we just call it soda and we think everyone else is crazy with their coke and pop talk
He said all of 2020 but didn't he have some 5 months ago for the beat the heat episode
This is what they deserve for not sponsoring you
For those looking for an alternative to buying soda and making their own, I highly suggest sodastream. If you like sparkling water, you can also make it with a sodastream.
Now I kinda wanna see Matt try soda from around the world.
i always wondered why Sprite tasted better from McDonald's
Anyone else just  Oh cool food theory released vid- WAIT A  MINUTE WHAT
Soda
NORTH CAROLINA REPRESENT
2020: MatPat stops drinking Diet Coke for a while Also 2020: Covid has entered the chat
Yay NC! I had no idea that Food Lion and Harris Tetter were NC based
impossible
Steph's face when he said it-XD
D
EAST COAST HARRIS TEETER GANG!!! :D
I'm a Dr. Pepper guy myself
How much of a sugar rush do you think they had after this
Crap, now that he said ¨...possibly the best diet cola in the world...¨ he is going to buy international colas when he gets the funding for it or if oversea fans send them to him if he asks.
THIS ISNT MATT ITS AN IMPOSTER IT ONLY LOOKS LIKE HIM!!!! CONSPIRACY CONFIRMED!!!
Matpat: let me know if you call it soda, pop, etc Me: nou, ik noem het gwn prik
I like Ginger Ale a lot. That and Dr. Pepper
clickbait? (done watching I can't believe hairs teder )
I don't like diet pop much (aspartame in general has a weird aftertaste to me and I just prefer real sugar anyway), but I do live in Cincinnati, the city where the Kroger company operates (and yes, Kroger grocery stores are everywhere around here). I'm pretty sure their Big K diet cola does contain citric acid like the Harris Teeter brand. I'll need to check that out next time I go grocery shopping even if I'm just going to buy the non-diet option anyway.
When it comes to stopping Matt’s Diet Coke addiction Steph is there to help!
Honestly the second Stephanie said that the one on the right was sweeter i knew it was fountain. People who work fast food get it
Who else got and saw the green weird glitches
I love how he makes harris teeter sound like this small little grocery store, when there's one a mile away from my house.
I did not realize that Food Lion and Ingles weren't household names everywhere.
Wait, Food Lion is a North Carolina thing? We have them in middle Tennessee
Aaahh! How did I not know you're a fellow North Carolinian?!?!
NO DR PEPPER DIET? SHAAAAME. Unsubbed. .... oooohh bread gloves ROFL  ... subbed The Food Theorists is had to quit ^^
did anyone see random green lines in the video?
I need to head to Ralph’s. I gotta try this out
How are you even considering fountain Diet Coke? Can you buy a giant jug of it? Guess you can, but it doesn’t make sense to put it up against other bottled or canned sodas unless you plan on buying literal 12-packs of fountain soda. Or install a fountain in your house -.-......o.o.......O.O
I love how Steph was just hanging her mouth open while MatPat was explaining why he likes the Harris Teeter one best. XD
15:30 refresco :D
i hadnt watch vid yet but judge by title poor matpat  edit: cool another soda but R.I.P diet coke in matpats vids
Did anyone else notice the video bugging out for a frame around 13:28 or is that just mine
Ay! Pick n' save cola tastes exactly like what your described lol
anybody see that at 13:31? go frame by frame using < >
steph is offended obvi
This is a dream right ? Hehe right???

You're missing Mexican Diet Coke, served in a glass bottle... although, maybe not sold in Carolina, I guess.
No not the liquid of the gods nooooooooooo
Fs in the chat for diet coke
D: other
Plot twist: This was just an excuse for MatPat to drink more Diet Cola
I think you guys would benefit from doing these types of episodes less in this style and more in the style of GMM, just a constructive thought tho!
This is Matpats way of getting back at coca cola for not sponsoring him
I have tried the "Big K" diet cola from Fred Meyer and it's okay.  Nothing as good as you're saying in my opinion.
Could people from around the country send him various Kroger brand soda through the mail? (I just check, and it is allowed through USPS, though one can't simply throw it in a box; there are precautions to take into account)
Being from the UK, I'm fizzy drinks as a descriptor for these.
Steph: and now he wants me to be part of his Diet Coke obsession (sigh)
when I saw the thumbnail and title is was worried that Matpat has a health issues that makes him not be able to drink fizzy drinks .😂😂😂
I'll send you some diet kroger cola if you'd like! We have Smiths and Food 4 Less here.
Diet Coke, just sponsor MatPat already.  You won't get a better endorsement.
Ironic that I'm drinking a regular coke while watching this-
I won
I like Pepsi zero more but my fav soda is Fiesta cola zero sugar (it has candy flavor to it that's just amazing (i doubt you guys have it) but it's like 2euro for 6X 50cl bottles it is very cheap
I feel out of the loop, but did Mat Pat move to the Carolinas?
This video brought to you by... Harris Teeter!  Lol, jk.
18:58 just have the camera man, matt, break the tie by him sampling it himself
Nooooo
In my head- Matpat: Get these garbage diet cokes outta here. *Camera stops rolling* Matpat: Gimme that sweet, sweet nectar. Waste not want not.
You should have drunk them with the bread gloves
My mom, dad and I all grew up in the same area and yet...she calls it coke, he calls it pop, and I call it soda. California's just off the rails I guess.
THE END OF A KING
You two playing rock, paper, scissors was the cutest thing ever
Matthew: I need a filler diet  soda  Harris Teeter: Lemme end  everybody’s whole career real quick
My wife and I basically only drink Coke Zero 😂
I'm more surprised that there are 16 diet colas than anything else.
I've been drinking Diet Shasta right now and I love it. I'm also a huge Diet Rite fan.
The semi-final shows WHY these sorts of judgements always take a third judge
did anyone else see the green flashes?
Why would you call it anything but coke
Soda
I say soda. I've said pop before, but not consistently. Soda is the one that comes to mind most naturally for me. 🥤
Someone : I quit smoking Someone else : I quit alcohol  Matpat : pathetic
it's coke. why would you call it soda or pop?
Game theory is married to fnaf film theory is married to disney But then food theory is married to citric acid
Where I live we call it soda
This has to be fake
NC born and raised 😁 this made me miss food lions deli 😅 if you want to find a good deal on cola, look in Walgreens or CVS, they usually have sales on 12 packs. Also, if you get to the statesville/Hickory area, grab some livermush to go with the diet cola... Sounds gross, tastes great.  And to answer the question, we always called it cola or soda... But we usually had to drink off brand Sam's cola or something as coke was too expensive to drink too often.
Wow the underdog truly wins
Food theory recommendation: episode on why aspartame is illegal in many countries and if America should follow suit.

Future Food Theory episode: Citric Acid
As someone who drinks Diet Coke almost as much as you do, when you mentioned the "Different Taste" thing at 4:05, I was nodding my head along. I could tell from the carbonation that the middle was the bottle. Bottled is always more carbonated, Canned tastes more flat, and obviously, Fountain tastes sweeter.
I'm from the UK and we call them Fizzy Drinks (more colloquially) or Soft Drinks (on menus) but honestly we call Cola flavours Coke, lemon/lime flavours Lemonade, and everything else mostly by the brand. Also we also often add '-ade' to the end of fruits a lot for, like, generic brands of fizzy fruit drinks. (Cherry-ade, Lemon-ade, Orange-ade etc.)
Im 100% pop caller
I just realized I have a freckle on my neck in the same spot as matpat 🧐
I love the borderlands reference

@matpat You want me to send you some Kroger diet cola?  I can get you HEB as well if you want.  Hmu
i live in charlotte and this episode absolutely blew my mind because i thought food lion and harris teeter were these huge grocery stores that everyone had. my life is a lie😭
Who are you and what have you done with Matt
B
Matpat has given up diet coke I think the world is ending and this has got to be the most click bate title that I have ever seen
this is not 100% accurate because there are some biases I would say its 57% accurate.
I can't wait to see the future comments saying "only OGs remember the diet coke addiction"
Are we gonna gloss over the tin foil hat theory that Citric Acid may be controlling us all?
Hey MatPat, the last season of infinity train is coming out soon and it would be really cool if you could do a film theory about it!
Ima soda
DIET PEPSI IS BETTER
I like diet coke for two reasons: it tastes different from regular coke and it has double the caffeine content of regular coke.
Other, spicy water.
I'm A.) Pop
Impossible.
should fountain diet coke be a contender as you wouldnt necessarily be going to a mcdonalds every time you wanted diet coke? Or maybe you would
Food Theory: Citric Acid, Does it control all food?!
diet coke
I kinda feel that you guys should have been told what drinks were in each round. I feel that just brought in biases and assumptions rather than really trying for the taste.
B
I have one thing to say, and one thing only.                                                                                                                                                                    HELLO INTERNET
Some people say they can’t drink alcohol but MatPat can’t drink diet Cola in 2020
CocaCola Life exists??
MattPat I recommend Tonicol and diet Tonicol, it is like vainilla coke
Diet Shasta should have been a 14 seed
This felt weird in the middle of my Snyder Cut watch )))
i am from NC  and oddly this was fun watching

Wait! Is this an ad about that soda? 😮
I saw this title and imeadiently went and told every one I knew
Bruh I shop Harris Teeter. I’m fond of the store. This was pleasant to witness
Here in Canada-Quebec we said Pepsi but Coke is near that. They even use a slogan in french which said "Ici c'est Pepsi" (here its Pepsi) to force that idea that we use the term Pepsi more than Coke in their commercial.
This is the true reason he made food theory
I have had went because my grandma walk there
He is the god of ✨Diet Coke✨
MatPat: I quit Diet Coke Me: O_O YOU WHAT?!?!?! Also Me: Where is Fritz Kola Sugar free?! (I'm from Germany and that's my favourite)
We found the ultimate theorist drink
I'm quitting diet coke but that's just a theory
The dislikes are from the coke company that lost millions in revenue
" *Impossible* "
Personally, I go with "Soda" as "Pop" sounds like I'm drinking pop-rocks, and WHO CALLS IT "COKE"?! COKE IS A SPECIFIC BRAND, NOT ALL SOFT DRINKS EVER.
Just sayin, diet Dr Pepper is better than all these "good sodas"
I love the march madness style!
I always called them by generic brand names. Coke. Sprite. Fanta. Sunkist.
Nah, there's no way MatPat leaves Diet Coke, I'm not buying it
I don't know why but I have been seeing something like the green color over the screen at 8:10 in many videos across the platform lately. I think I saw it in a video on Claire Saffitz x Dessert Person, and a GMM/Mythical Kitchen Video as well?
When you like Pepi (ಠ_ಠ)>⌐■-■
I heard somewhere that if you squeeze a lime onto cilantro, it weirdly tastes like cola. So citric acid makes a lot of sense!

Food lion and Harris Teeter's are also in VA
Stay away from artificial sweeteners
“Coke” is interesting it’s a southern thing but also has a weird foothold in south western Indiana, where I’m originally from. It’s weird though it’s only Coke if it’s dark if it’s light it’s soda.

Stef: uhh, idk its a bit weird.  Matt: ARRRRRGH, I HATE IT WITH A BURNING PASSION!!!!
This was posted like an hour ago.Why is there 6000 comments?!
I had no idea food lion and Harris teeter were NC things
B
After years he quit his addiction
B. Soda
Knowing his history with diet coke i clicked this so fast
Me: Drinking water like a plebeian
**reads title** WAIT THATS ILLEGAL-
whats that flash aty 13:30?
Watching you and steph is just adorable, more videos with Stephanie. Channel #4 Marriage Theory confirmed?
Matpat explaining why does he prefers NO 2   Stephanie - mouth open
i don't have a local harris teeter but i have had local food lions since i was a kid & i'm in maryland
Kroger at it again, ask Rhett and Link, it's the sleeper hit of the century
Matpat giving up diet coke is like me giving up diet mt dew o.O
Y u quit diet coke?!?!?!
Question has Abby one ever had the flavored Pepsi? I’m having the mango one right now and it’s pretty good
Day one of waiting on the Kevin's chili episode
Get harris teeter and walk there
If this is for what I think it is; then you have my absolute respect MatPat! Edit: Not for the reason I was thinly, but I’m glad you’re ditching coke! Keep up the excellent work man!
No way! Diet Coke is inevitable.
No just no
Don't go for Pepsi MatPat
In one week, he is going to start loving Pepsi lite
This Michigander calls it pop.
My first thought when I saw this “How in heck did you quit” also being born in Georgia I’m so proud of being southern
I always call it soda, pop just feels wrong
Coke Zero/ Zero Cherry are my go-to and favorites.
B
i say soda
Noooooo, diet coke will be missed. Diet pepsi must win.
3:46 *Hears what Matpat says* Me: Uh, let's go back and hear that again and check subtitles. *does both* Also Me:
I still stick to coke zero as most of those others are unavailable in the UK
1 hour ago
The coke is a lie..!
Never would I have guessed it
Early nah
c
C. Coke
After this episode, we really need a food theory on all the sugar substitutes! Stevia? Aspartame? Which one to bake with? Which ones healthiest?
Umm, food lion is a belgo-dutch store line
At 13:31 hmmmmmmmm
So just Look for citrus acid in your coke sodas?
Also everyone pulling for the "North Carolina Local Brands"  Pepsi was founded in NC as well in New Bern, NC in 1965
so why has the screen been gliching???  its doing if for ever video, not the screen but the videi itself.
water
I thought food lion and Harris  teeter where everywhere.
Soda, but i only like regular coke over any other cola .
14:35 wait Food Lion is still a thing!?!?!?! I thought they all closed!!!! (At least the one I went to when I lived in Florida that I went to when I was little did, I think)
Has anyone noticed the three yellow strips that flash on screen at 3:03-3:04
To be fair, Shasta does usually have decent sodas, but they're reeeally cheap
Time to switch to Fanta
Pop gang rise up!
No
Soda In North Texas a pop is also known as a float like a root beer float
Diet cola companies be like . . "Quick, where's the citric acid It's sponsorship time"
As a person who never even took a full sip of any soda in my life. Why do people like soda so much?
15:28 *B* and *C*
Haha I don’t recognize any of those Kroger stores at the end. Ah well.
B. soda
I prefer the name high fructose carbonated addictive tea
I call foul.   You said nothing with an added flavor. Harris has an added flavor, it failed one of the basic entry conditions
Impossible
im so proud to be a north carolinian
if only real sport tie's could be settled with the different teams doing a rock paper scissors
Welp...it's time to buy Harris Teeter stocks if there are
Join the dark side, drink regular coke.
am I the only one who noticed that the video have ended cutting off mat's words
mat quiting coke is a sign that the end of the world is coming
MatPat: "I'm quitting Diet Coke!
Diet Shasta cola is my second favorite but Diet Coke is my #1 favorite I’ve tried everything else near me but Diet Coke can’t be beat for me i have an addiction
we call it fizzola where i live
What the heck no way
HOW MANY COLA"S ARE THEIR JEEZ?!
Nooooooo
I always called it coke regardless of what kind of soda it was
A:pop is me
They should have a theory about the power of citric acid
I need the winner coke..that sounds SO much better then the coke i'm drinking right now- No matter what this coke just tastes straight up flat and weird..-
camera: *glitches multiple times* me: MY THEORY SENCES ARE TINGELING
So since there's Kroger in my area, I looked up their store brand diet cola vs harris teeter zero calorie cola, and here are my findings: The nutrition facts are basically identical, but while the ingredients are identical they are listed in slightly different orders. So there is a slight difference in recipe? or, perhaps, the ingredients which are moved are equal in quantity and they just changed up the order on the other labels to make them appear different... who knows? I might just have to try the Kroger brand Big K Diet Cola B)
I'm quitting Diet Coke (ALL Coca-Cola products) because of the memo put out to it's employees. Gonna help them out on their goal. 👍
Guys we broke matpat
MatPat: I'm quitting diet coke Legit everyone: *I M P O S I B L E*
The ultimate food theory click bait title...
I love this episode! Doing a bracket was so entertaining and I'm glad you found a new soda that you love
Steph easily chose the best option.
Steph and Matt have such good chemistry, I'm so happy they are married. That rock paper scissors bit was amazing.
i think i found harris teeter in california Dr.K
Everybody gangsta until MatPat changes the coke of his  change
As a person who lives in the uk we call it fizzy drinks
Does the frutiness not make Harris Teeter more comparable to Diet coke lime, which was ineligable to be entered? If so should Harris Teeter be allowed and how does it compare to diet coke lime which would also have citrus?
Mini episode, the top winners plus a few bolder options taste testing after bites of different food like a pairing.
I’m from chicago, it’s soda
dr pepper will cure your problems baby
Food Lion is down here in SC too lol. And I'm 100% a soda sayer. Both of my parents aren't from Wisconsin, where I grew up, so I ended up being the odd one out all the time because everyone up there calls it pop. At least anything is better than calling everything coke.
Root beer and cream soda are the greatest sodas, I stand by that
i did the same with ice tea : the winer?  caned lipton ice tea (personal preference)
I'm sorry what places know about food lion???? its a big place in NC
Citric Acid is the new MSG
B:Soda
Fountain Diet Coke?   But... who does the mixing?  That's horrible!   CAN Diet Coke.... *grr*
I have liked every single video on food Theory and subscribed
Good Mythical Morning but MatPat
It’s coke
Sparkling Ice: 😐
I live by the Johnnie Ryan factory, and can confirm that while most flavors are absolutely amazing, the diet is the one outlier of the bunch.
Wait a minute. As a NC native i never knew that food lion and harris teeter were relatively unknown.
first thought seeing the thumbnail: MatPat's not drinking diet coke anymore?! BLASPHEMY! also wonder how Faygo would have matched up, sucks they don't live where they could realistically get it also part 2: i use soda and pop interchangeably
soda i live near the cost
I just saw the title why must you quiet???!?!?!?!?!
Oh wow. Who knew that the theorists live just north of me. (North Carolina to south Carolina.)
The last picked coke was the best picked coke
D:  Either a "Soda-Pop" which is the full version of both the wrong names everyone uses, or I go really old school fountain drink poured and mixed fresh by a soda jerk and call it a "Phosphate"
Lol I have food lion and harris trader in my state
Yo where did mat get that jacket because I want it 😍
That rock paper scissors was the cutest thing.
anyone what happened at 8:10 ?
A
me looking at title, haven't even watched yet, "NO!"
Me: there can't be any surprises in 2021 2020 had them all   Matpat: OBSERVE
I'm too Canadian to call it anything other than pop
I WANNA COME TO AMURICA
pop
Ladies and gentlemen, he did it.         he FREAKING did it
Try Jones soda
3:47 subtitles off
I will die for Pepsi Max... It’s been my favourite since I was a kid. I even wrote about it in my grade 6 thing for ending primary school. What I took from this is you guys seem to call it Pepsi Zero though :o
17:08 Citric Acid must be the secret ingredient in the Krabby Patty too
Grew up in  Atlanta. It was unequivocally Coke, not pop or soda.
It warms my heart to see a Cinderella team come out of no where to shock the nation and win the whole thing.
We finally have one therory that is true lol
Soda
I saw the thumbnail for this video...audibly gasped...and clicked SO FAST
I wonder what does Mat do to reset his palate between drinks.
I just watched 23 min of people drinking diet colas and I don’t regret it
I wonder if Harris Teeter knows you fully endorse their private label product over the national brand name product. They'd probably enjoy this immensely.
I grew up calling it soda
The camera glitches around minute 13
Wait until matpat gets sponsored by Diet Coke
RIP Fry's...
When I was in North Carolina I had some of that Harris Teeter stuff and omg I have to agree hands down. The stuff is so gosh darn good. Sad that we live in Oklahoma I wanna go back so bad. ❤️NC
Hipster hair hipster quitting
Coke Zero is my personal favorite
coke
Does MatPat’s 2020 Diet Coke withdrawl mean that all the Diet Coke tested in fastfoods to decide which is the best was drunk by Stephanie?!
DIERB COKE!!!
As the Buffalonian, clearly it is A and always will be A (with some bleu cheese)
This is extremely shocking, looks like the new drink of choice in diet Coke is Harris Teeter. That is pretty shocking to me, knowing that I thought the diet Coke that he already drinks was going to win; I guess there’s a new King now. Thankfully it does not have aspartame in it.
Harris teeter cola after this episode :      STONKS
In Eastern Europe we have Pepsi Twist and Cola Lime, which are better taste wise.
Wait, what's wrong with aspartame? In the screenshot that was provided, every sentence said it was safe.
How about irn bru
I live in North Carolina and food lion are everywhere
I'm from the midwest and we all call it soda too. Anyone else just really love this style of theory videos? Getting to see Matt and Steph and not just a little animated Matpat?
maybe now he's going to drink zero sugar coke
I love Kroger diet cola!
I haven't even finished the episode... on minute 4... and I can already tell you that you are crazy.  As an equally diet-cola aficionado, you are already wrong, if you don't end up picking Diet Coke.  *watches the rest of the episode*
I swear if you people don’t have Pepsi max
Dude. Get a Soda Stream.  Also, North Carolina? I thought you were based out in Los Angeles like every other YouTuber lately.
Anyone else see the glitch at 13:31
as someone who has live in the mid- Atlantic, hearing that not everyone has a food lion or Harris teeter is WILD
Where I live we call it fizzy. Because its fizzy.
I've never clicked so fast in my LIFE
Citric acid is the secret krabby patty recipe
As someone with a type 1 diabetic friend, who can only drink diet soda reliably, this is a interesting theory
Yeah, and I quit YouTube multitasking /s.  Cactus Cooler is my coke replacement suggestion.
Whoa whoa I got to stop u right there!  Diet Coke is like your second child
B
Coke
Matt: It's all citric acid? Steph: Always has been
Omg......TOO MANY COKE😖😫🤯
I'm coke My dad calls soda "pop"  As for me its coke TwT
Soda
Youtube: Here *shows me video*  Me: *Reads title*  Me: Guys we broke him...
Does it matter, because I willing drink anything, that you can give me.
Bruh
13:31 is this a clue for something?
13:31 flash
I appreciate the bl2 zer0
@matpat Raleigh or Charlotte?
Matthew: I need a filler diet soda  Harris Teeter: Lemme end everybody’s whole career real quick
I literally read the title and gasped out loud
D:soft drink
Personally, I've never liked Diet Coke much. I find that it doesn't taste like cola at all. More like seltzer water and aspartame. But Coke Zero tastes almost identical to regular Coke. So the fact that it made it to top 3 makes a lot of sense. Steph has good taste.
WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE IS MATPAT!?!?!
As a Canadian, I call it a pop. I think most of us do.
Mat..... What happened?  P.s I haven't finished watching the vid yet.
The fact you drink DIET coke alone speaks volumes to your taste, but you chose watered down soda fountain coke over can and bottle too? Big yikes on this one.
Glass bottle > can >> fountain > plastic bottle Fight me
And here I was going to suggest Kroger’s Big K soda if it was an option 🤣🤣🤣
2:33 i actually have the book that this picture was taken from
Coke refused to sponsor Matt so he decided to go scorched-earth
Message from the gods, they say: you look thristy fam, drink this.
Coke Zero is one of my favorite diet sodas too
I know this is on Diet Coke, but it’s going to be Gonzaga who wins against Illinois in the end
Can he actually do it without bias?
Why do diet drinks taste so nasty to me?
Imagine diet coke sees the video title and asks if they can sponsor the theory channels now so they can prevent their unlimited supply from becoming limited and knows that matpat still can't refuse
YEAHHHHHH HARRIS TEETER FOR THE WIN!!!!!  LETS GOOOOO
Ever tried water?
Coke when they see that MatPat has quit Diet Coke: Oh no! How's our business going to survive?
I have a addiction with cherry coke
It’s all coke
Heresy
13:27
In the caribbean, we call carbonated non alcoholic drinks, soft drinks.
Why does matpat have lesbian hair in the tumbnail
His Aspertame intake must be so high at this point, it's just a matter of waiting for him to be hospitalized.
I CANT BELIVE THIS IM CRYING RIGHT NOW
At 13:31 does anyone else get a visual glitch in the video.
I'm from north Carolina
here in the uk its pop :) never heard anyone here call it anything else (fizzy pop cause some people for some reason call juice pop but they're just weird lol)
15:33, I'm soda.
:O
It’s with certainty that MatPat likes Diet Coke more than Batman!
Why didn't Faygo diet soda make the list? It's a regional Midwest brand, but you can buy from them directly on their website.
I've always called it soda
Food theory: why you shouldn’t drink soda
soft drink
i'm team coke zero! caffeine free if i can find it. lol
EXCUSE ME??? you really picked FOUNTAIN???????? Idk if it’s a states thing but in Denmark it is widely acknowledged that fountain is the worst??? It’s thinner and flatter??? As a Coca Cola lover myself I give my whole heart to glass bottles any day of the week! I’m sorry mat this just got PERSONAL!  Joke but also serious/
i'm realy sad right now because in Bulgaria there is no food chain that sells anything else than Coca Cola, Pepsi and Dr. Pepers. These are the all sodas here. :(
Most of the ppl in paraguay say Coca "coke" instead of soda or anything like that, just like she says
I dont drink coke lol i drink green tea
Some call it pop or Soda
I find this incredibly clickbait XD  Cause I can easily tell, without looking in the description or even watching a second of the video while knowing Pats goofy format, that title says quiting Diet coke but he never said he was quitting diet cola. That or it is just a troll/bit and he won't last a month with this cause this is Patty we are talking about XD
Impossible
He did it   That son of a gun actually did it
I JUST today found out Mat Pat lives in North Carolina lmao
#notspon
Coke Zero tastes more like full sugar Coke (peroid). Edit: A. Pop (I live in North Carolina)
Soda here. Northeast U.S. in New England.
Noooooooooooooo
Top 10 anime betrayals and this one is number one ☝️
I will say this: Kroger's "Cola 0" zero sugar cola tastes more like Coca Cola than Coke Zero.
Crispy drinks
Aspartame and a lot of sweeteners have the exact same amount of calories as sugar, 4 per gram.  But they are hundreds of times sweeter so its virtually zero.  Being pedantic for the win.  Soda is objectively. OBJECTIVLY, tastes the best out of glass bottle.  Sad its not common enough to be an option for all.  I should probably finish the video before typing but internet induced ADHD FTL yeah!  Fountain soda is a highly variable taste.  Some places use more syrup or different rations than others.  As someone who drinks 3 liters a day of diet coke, I can assure you that if you only had Zevia or Whole Foods Diet Cola (which is generic zevia) it would probably grow on you rather quickly, but that strange bitterness never truly goes away.  And of course, living in NJ right next to Manhattan, the most populous place in the world, and none of the Kroger brands listed are in this area.
Gotta love the underdog.
Me: See's title Me: Oh....No..........
I'm a "pop" primarily, with a "soad" now and again (mostly from living in a predominately "soda" area for a long time), and once and a while I'll use "soft drink" or "carbonated beverage" or the like.
Here in England we call it fizzy drink
click bait we all know the chemical dependency is too strong
Food lion was my local grocery store growing up lol
This is the only thing I think it’s impossible
Hey mat, lay off cocoa cola life, it's better for some people that have different dietary needs and concerns but still want to enjoy cola, your diet soda has many issues too, mmm tatse all that extra sodium
I would prob just pick the cheapest still good tasting one
I live in the south and I've only ever called them soda
I think all cola tastes so gross. Much more about Dr. Pepper and Root Beer flavors.
I call it all coke
Greatest shonen anime of all time
coke/soda
“But remember that’s just (not) a theory”
My world view has been changed
the south gets weirder as this is an actual possible conversation here.  "what kind of coke do you want?" "coke" "sorry we dont have coke is pepsi ok?"
There goes the Diet Cola sponsorship. >XD
I work at Kroger own store up here in Washington, called QFC. I do like Diet Big K .
Bruh I feel like coko zero sugar taste better 😅
Shasta soda is not that good but the fruit punch is killer
I grew up on Diet Coke. I stopped drinking pop over 10 years ago now, its just an occasional treat. I would love to try that Harris Teeter cola but I'm Canadian and it doesn't seem Kroger has any Canadian store market :( Dang
GMM viewers: KROGER STRIKES AGAIN
6:43 will you shut up your wife saying
I’m cocaine
I'm in Oklahoma and have heard of Food Lion. It's not because I have ever been to one or even live by one, but I know Mr. Beast bought out 50% of one in a video :)
why are there like green flickers at some points of the video? is it for another game? 🤔🤔
Technically everything has calories
B
Coke and Pepsi taste the same. Change my mind.
As a diet coke connoisseur myself, I usually drink canned, but I think that fountain tastes the best.
I've been wating lol!
This is a day for the history books
A lot of people here in Canada call it pop
NOOO... u and coke... broke up?! welll, WHOS NEXT :D
In Singapore we all call it horlock lmao
If you ever branch out to non-diet sodas in NC, Cheerwine is the best option. Trust me.
How small do you think Harris Teeter is, but there are 17 in the charleston, SC region. Also I'm almost certain that they are owned by Winn Dixie.
I've never known until today that Harris T and Food Lion were only in NC
The title is lies it’s not a theory. He did quit Diet Coke lol
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Just wait till Lowes Foods has the best cola.
I took one look at the thumbnail and thought clickbait
nobody is gonna talk about when they did a game theory about video game bo0bs
We call it soda pop
Please do the same thing as this but with dr. pepper and it's clones like mr.pibb or dr. shasta i would love to find out which you think is the best.
i always root for underdogs and i didn't know why...
You had two seventh seeds.
Impossible
Gotta love those name grocery store brand stuff!
I have not watched the video, but I am angry at the title  you are a bad person.  I hate you.  I used to be a fan.  Other mean things.
Lies deception physically impossible
Forgets glass bottle diet coke
It's coke, you heathens.
Me watching from outside the US:  I shall never get the privallge to tatse such exquisite sodas smh
Nonononononononono
I stop drinking Diet Soda since High School. Diet soda has a strange taste to me vs regular soda. Sweeteners aren't my thing
How are we supposed to trust someone who prefers the fountain cola....
I am with mat, In Michigan we call it Pop.
Wait, wait wait wait wait! You isolated fountain DC but not fountain D pep? Insanity.
Foda-se as colas, drink Guaraná.
I did not know that Kroger Owns Harris Teeter now. That's interesting since that means there are three kroger owned stores within a few miles of each other in my area, two Krogers and a Harris Teeter.
If you see this I hope you have a good day
57 minutes ago and still 5.7k comments lmao
Hey MatPat. As another diet soda lover born around cleveland in 86, I used to drink a lot of Diet Coke. Eventually I started getting sluggish and sick with headaches all the time. I had developed a sensitivity to benzoic acid. So no more sodium benzoate or potassium benzoate en masse for me. I switched over to diet Sodastream since I could actually have it. It is pretty good. Best diet soda though, European plastic bottle Diet Coke. They don't use the same preservatives in Europe and it also tastes better!
Matpat without diet coke is like eugene without alcohol.
It’s been 69 days since I’ve had ANY diet or regular soda!
Eeww sharing straws!
See I love that he is trying to do this but the whole episode all I was obsessed with the fact his leather jacket had a hood
FOOD LION?!? I haven't heard of that chain since it went out of business in my hometown ( a few hours drive out of nc)
Twist
Mat Pat quits Diet Coke? Who are you and what did you do to Mat!?
I class them as fizzy drinks but often just use the brand name
Normal coke!
Oh god
I'm from North Carolina and even I'm surprised at how good the store brand sodas are
i would have died out of laugh if i saw Manaos as a contender.
This is a great video guys but I have some isssues with it. 1) Video glitches. There are about 3-4 video glitches in the video. 2) Lightning. Lightning behind Steph and Matt is too bright and it is sometimes difficult to watch. I very enjoy your work and I am not some kind of video expert, but please try to avoid these mistakes next time.
I have to ask, do you not have RC Cola over there?  From what I hear, it is the one that wins most of these things.  I checked, and it seems to meet the requirements
b
Fun Fact: Here in Austria, we just call them "Erfrischungsgetränke" which roughly translates to "Refreshing Drinks". Colloquially these types of drinks are also referred to as "Anti", referencing the fact that they don't contain any alcohol. #themoreyouknow
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DIET COKE DONT LEAVE US
18:59 welp that’s a married couple for ya
HOW DID HE LIVE Also I love that the where's waldo joke replaces waldo with a  can of diet coke Finally, FOR EXCLUDING DR PEPPER I SWEAR.................... A VENDETTA
Some Business Manager at Krogers, watching this- "Let's pitch this and have our soda branded uniquely, and form a franchise"
*Impossible*
the end is near
POP
I don't drink soda anymore, but when I did kroger brand was the best
D water!!! Water pat
Who are you and what did you do to our mat pat?!?
I've just watched 2 people drinking and arguing about cola for like half an hour   Totally worth it
boylan root beer is the best root beer ive ever had tbh, if u doubt them try it
there are hints embedded into the video for sure im just not one to extract them
Steph looks so serious at the beginning like:  “Yes Matpat has a problem with Diet Coke. Yes, this is what we do. Yes, this is consider normal.  I make no mistakes on what I do 🧍🏻‍♀️”
ok mat i live and have never left the midwest and we call it soda get ur facts right
It’s not betrayal, it’s Diet Coke fault for not sponsoring MatPat
Irn bru
A pop
I love the zevia stuff
:O should I be sad?
In the Netherlands we call soda "prik" (also carbonated water, its cus the "spiky" feeling on your tounge).
I love how this channel slowly devolved into just watching two people eat and drink and frozen some science every once in a while
Team pop here, haha Midwest represent!
I sorta wish they would have gone with either the can or bottle diet soda.  Fountain so is just wildly different, so it's hard to compare against the others.  It's also pretty mind blowing that they both preferred fountain diet coke, and neither ended with that on top.  Also, fountain soda is terrible haha.
I’m a coke person. Pop and Soda sounds fancy or something it doesn’t sound right
Thanks to MatPat, I too am a Diet Coke fan. Also up in North Dakota I’m a Soda person.
C
Not gonna lie I live in middle europe and until I went to denmark where my cousins lived I never heard of the term coke. We just always say coca cola or pepsi or whatever soda you want. I was so scared because the word coke is the same as 'koka' which drug users sometimes use instead of cocanium and I thought they were gonan kick us out of the bar lol
Hey Mathew do you have any idea if Harris teeter doing shipping to the dead sea because I would really like to taste it
Him switching BRANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!
If I don’t find the love stef and Matt have I don’t want it
Kroger stonks are about to SKY ROCKET 🚀 TO THE MOON BABY!!!!!!
Never thought this day would come
Forgot glass bottles
RIP Diet coke
You WHAT!?!?!!

have you seen the new kfc crisps their nice
LA CROX
pepsi
We call it soda in Colorado
C: Coke
Boylan's regular Cane Cola is definitely better than their diet version
For the record, the ONLY place I have found Pay-Less grocery stores is in Madison County in Indiana.

Matpat quitting diet coke caused 2020 confirmed
Food Theory episode:  Our citric acid on foods and see if it makes food better if worse.
Congratulations MatPat! Not only did you stay as blind as you could you actually chose a soda that wasn't Diet Coke! Congrats!
B B B B BBB  B BB BB BBB
Food Theory: Video about Coke. Me: It's my time to rise! >:D
I once tied 27 times in paper scissors rock with my best friend. I could barely breathe by the end of it.
Unrelated but Pub Subs are the best sandwiches around. Subway is more like subpar and Jimmy John's is... Jimmy John's. Jersey Mike's is alright, at least they have Philly's. Those are the only mainstream sandwich places around town so it's not hard to come to that conclusion, including bang for buck.
19.22 Stephanie's eyes it seems like she's controlled if you guys can help me
4:15 And people say: BuT ThEY alL TASte tHe SME.  NO THEY DO NOT! YOU WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND THE FINES OF COLA AND ITS DELECATE DIFFERENCES YOU IGNORANT BAFOON!
It was destined in the stars Harris Teeter has risen to become the greatest diet soda in the world.
Anyone see that camera glitch around 4:03
Lol did anyone else play 13:30 at super slow speed to see if there was subliminal text? 😅
Dr pepper all the way
I call it soda and I live in the Mid-west so you have some explaining to do Mat
Its called pop because when you leave it in your car in winter it goes POP!
Impossible!
This does bring a smile to my face
Am i paranoid or did anyone else notice the color glitches?
I love diet rite and Pepsi 0 sugar
Fanta try Fanta
I can’t believe they didn’t use palate cleansers. Also that 6 round rock paper scissors tie was pretty cute.
I do water, I have never drank a cola in my life.
I'm used to soda and hate when people use "coke" to mean all fountain drinks...
First time I've ever wanted clickbait
Next: Same soda but from different parts of the world. As someone who travelled a lot (but doesn´t drink any soda), people from the US, Brazil and Argentina all say that the flavor of their same brand Coca Cola taste dramaticlly different, despite being the same product
Here's a question, is diet soda actually better? (Both for you, and tasting)
Well as someone born in Raleigh NC, but raised in Richmond Virginia I switch between Soda and Coke. Also Virginia has varying amounts of “southerness” to it. So up in NOVA I feel like I’ve heard Pop, Richmond area is Soda and most other places are Coke
I love Kroger’s Big K soda brand. So sad it’s not on the list. *wink*
8:10  22:52  🤔
Well we now know who should be your next sponsor!
Incredible and lol! Well done Harris Teeter
Stef’s face is so funny
As an original Food theorist, this is impressive
I can say as someone who lives 5 minuts from a kroger that there diet cola dose have that fuity after taste
Diet dr p is better than regular and Pepsi is better than coke
In Finland it is said limukka or limsa
I call it cola cuz i'm not actaully american or even english at all lol
I have very sensitive tastebuds so back in the day I called it "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH PAPI HELP ITS SPICING ME!!!!!"
B
The beginning of the end
Team Coke zero to the win
How is that a theory
Matpat: You have probably never heard of Food Lion. Me living in North Carolina: Well actually
Its called soda in the midwest
What was that green flash at 4:06 ?
*Plot twist : Game Theory is Diet Coke, and this video is a means to sponsor it.*
pop gang where you at?
Me: *sees title Vegeta voice: *IMPOSSIBLE*
4. Other. Im in Scotland so idk what others say but, growing up, I called it fizzy juice and have been for 17 years
As someone living in a Kroger-brand area, I can't provide evidence of the diet cola specifically, but I can say that Kroger brand foods are usually better than their brand name competitors. And it's not even close.
You would think that matpat would know that its been scientifically proven that Diet soft drinks have alternatives that can give you cancer and that funnily enough the non diet soft drinks are actually healthier than the diet drinks
The Krabby Patty secret formula is Citric Acid.
proud of you Matt, You achieved the impossible.
But using Splenda in Diet Rite causes you to crave sweeter things and thus leads you to eat and crave those types of foods more. That's one of the major drawbacks of Splenda.
I never thought I'd see the day
Matt Pat: March madness is happening as we speak me and intellectual knowing that March madness starts in 2 hours
I thought RC cola was a big cola chain too like coca cola.
soda im soda
Conspiracy theory video is sponsored by Haris Teeter
I prefer coke zero. No not because it's zero becuase of the taste it has a almost cleaner taste don't know how to explain
B: Soda. And I give some of my friends a LOT of grief when they say "coke" when they want a Dr Pepper
Pop
Sugar free sprite
Next theory Which is better? Cereal then Milk Milk then Cereal
coke
My cousins and I have had the most heated battles over whether it was “Pop” or “Soda”. It got so bad we had to compromise and call it “Soda Pop”
My first reaction to the title was   “Wait matpat is quitting Diet Coke?!??!?!?!
*why does the moon have a face*
You should try two rooks cola It’s my favourite cola but it’s hard to get in stores
I'm in Texas, most people say Soda here
hey fun fact, foodlion is actailly from belgum originally ( thus the lion like the flemish lion) :) by use the store is called ' delaize' but it was to deficuld of a name in the us so they changed it. ( at least that was sumthing i was told)
The most scientific part of this series has to be the Rock Paper Scissors, I mean, why would people play poker for a living otherwise?
Drinking coke from the tet now
Entirely unrelated, but I made an inhuman noise and reached out to the screen to fix Steph's hair where her bangs meet at the part, because a chunk of strands were just like "I wanna go be over there, but I'm not allowed". Not trying to make anyone self-conscious, just sharing what I thought was funny because I was personally so frustrated that I couldn't fix it. Thank you for fixing it part way through!
Mini Theory: Diet Coke could be the best if, like Mat said was the determining factor with the soda, some citric acid was added. I have personally put a bit of lemon juice into Diet Coke and it was better.
Jesus Christ, he's slowly turning into the Gordon Ramsay of root beers.
REMEMBER THATS A FACT! A literal fact.
Coke
Boylan has really good vanilla cream soda. Never had the diet cola, but I might try it out of spite or curiosity because of this
I'm hoping diet Dr pepper wins. Tis mah favorite Edit: neeeeeever mind. 2:55
wat
Did I just watch a 25 minute video on what the best soda is even though I don't like soda at all and this information will never be useful to me?  Yeah, what about it?
*shoked pikachu face*
As a viewer in England, we generally don't say soda, pop or the other options.  The general term (at least in my area) is fizzy for carbonated drinks.
D sodapop
I call it coke, i live in the south as well    Edit: i also dont drink coke
Wait? You picked fountain as the moveing up one? Are you fucking crazy?!
Contains one of the most intense Rock-Paper-Scissors/Scissors-Paper-Rock you’ll ever see.
the fact that i got a pepsi ad on this
Took on a screenshot on my phone for the Kroger-owned supers~ it would make an interesting test to see if there are differences~
I call it Acidic sugary brown water
I would click the subscribe button, MatPat, but then I'd unsubscribe. I don't know if that's really what you want.
What's with the yellow lines at 3:04?
Your videos always make my day. :D
Heresy?!?!?
Where is the Pepsi 😡
*Sees title in sub box" This can't be true
oh and does anyone else see screen glitches
A.
Down here in southwestern Florida it's either called soda or soft drink depending on where you are
*me who lives in Virginia and has a Harris teeter, but I don’t drink soda*
mat pat: are you. a: pop. d: soda. c: coke. or d: other me: I'm. e: all.
I am sure we Theory fans can send you a "Store Brand" from our local stores for you to test.
try jaffa
Pop in Michigan (plus the Canadians that come over here 'Port Huron- call it pop as well) Also Kroger cherry cola is hands down better than cherry coke or Pepsi
I've gone to Harris Teeter so many times and seen that soda, but I've never bothered trying it since I've had a bad experience with "offbrand Diet Coke". But to hear MatPat claim that the Harris Teeter Diet Cola is better than Diet Coke makes me think that I should go give it a try.
Plz try ornge fanta

HAHA FOODLION SODA LETS GO!!!(i havent watched whole video so idk if it won but im rooting for my favorite cheapo brand!!!)
This is all a ploy to get Coca Cola to sponsor him by threatening them with a 10% reduction in revenue from Mat's spending.
Iced tea
When I saw that my personal favorite, Kroger's Dr. K Diet Cola wasn't on the testing list, I was very sad. Then I got to the end and I was happy.

Plot twist: matpat was using this to get diet cokes attention and get sponsored by them.
Soda for life
In my opinion, Ginger ale is actually better than any other soda drink. And im not even canadian that stuff is just awesome
How to make good food: citric acid
Big K Cola Oh! has the same ingredient list as is on Harris Teeters page so they are probably the same drink. You can get Big K soda at smiths or ralphs.
D. Cold drink and the actual names of the drink. Although sometimes I call them soda.
return of the king
I quit diet coke and found out that my thirst was unquenchable. Let's see if MatPat felt the same
I call it all plus soda pop XD
Let's go can we get a coke sponsorship
I thought i was watching Regular show near the end
I fall under other, colloquially we call it cooldrink but my family calls it fizzy
This is the most intense food rating video I have ever seen. With such a weirdly compelling underdog story alongside it as well?
We used to have food lions down here in Florida but I haven't seen one in years back in the early 2000s I know they were around but I'd say around 2006 2008 somewhere around there they started disappearing

In New York we call it soda
7th seeded Boylan cane cola. 7th seeded Caffeine free Diet Pepsi.   Erm....?
I never liked the carbonation bubbles in coke, it always hurts my throat. Guess this is why I like Nestea.

Harris Tetter:  MatPat's newer, younger fling from Diet Coke
Coca Cola is coke. Everything else is soda
The Food Theorists aka Shokuhin riron-ka The Anime! Tournament Arc:
original coke zero was the best, but then they changed the recipe and it never tasted nearly as good. also the new coke zero has too much fizz (big bottles) my new favourite is called cola x, but as far as i know, the brand "Grans" is a norwegian alternative that is about half the price of regular coke since it's made in norway
Foodlion is not just nord Carolina in Belgium and france it is called delhaize and it is a very common supermarket
I say soda, but my region says tonic
Here in Scotland, we call it all "Juice". Fruit juice, fizzy juice, beetle juice, it's all juice.
Hi I saw a food lion in Tennessee once it was when I was going out of my state

Soda pop in Arizona
Dear Mr. Mathew patricson: Can you pleas make a video about the Youtube Series “ Meta runner”. It is a very well made series, and features a things that usual media like Tv don’t have. The charakters are interesting have multiple persanalitys, which means that there is not just, the smart one, the strong guy, or the shy girl, which makes them more human. Second: the story is pretty cool. And it all plays in a World where video games are media Nummber 1 which is something that you don’t see that often. And thirdly: The development story of the hole Series is pretty interesting to. and especially the to guy that started all this are some pretty funny guys. And fourth but that’s just my opinion: Meta runner has such dame good soundtrack. I love it! Meta runner is the first series were I love the intro and the outro. The only show that came close to that is Gravity falls with its intro, and we all liked Gravity falls. And that’s why I am beging for you to make a video about it. Because I think that such a brave series that try’s so mutch new stuff, deserves more attention. ( oh and sorry for my bad Englisch, I am from Germany.)
GFUEL
Me: *reads the title* INCONCEIVABLE!!!!
Here before 1M views
WHYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
How is MatPat so thin??? He says himself he loves pizza and dietcoke in large amounts lol.
There's been a tremendous amount of safety research on aspartame and it's actually come back quite favorable. Most of the references in that very wikipedia article shown here are talking about that. I find the taste of stevia kind of off-putting and sucralose tends to be too sweet except in a few specific beverages I've tried.
Epic twist
Plot twist: Citric acid is the secret ingredient in the Krabby Patty
I bet that fountain Diet Coke came from McDonalds
Why did the camera kept glitching is he trying to tell us something
In the uk it’s definitely just called pop
In the country I live in diet coke does not exist so I only drink coke cola
I saw the title and I was like WHAT
I call them Carbonated Beverage.
Diet Coke never sponsored MatPat for any of his channels and now they've lost their chance. He's left diet coke behind for a better cola
"Let me explain the flavor of this one-" *_sip_* "Not good."  Edit: To answer the question of "Coke, Soda, Pop, or Something Else," I'm going with Soda Not that anyone's going to care, but-
I’m really excited interested to know what other stores so that Harris Teeter flavor soda 🤔🧐

13:30 Wtf was that
Food Theory has now made Harris Teeter so famous-
Is citric acid the krabby patty secret formula?!
Limo or Gsieferl are the names we give Sodas in Austria
Uh, so did you take the idea of comparing food in a March madness style tournament from GMM? Or did GMM take food March madness from somewhere else?

I just saw the title, haven't seen it....w.t.h MATPAT?!?! T.T
Matpat: I QUIT Diet Coke! Also Matpat: I just drank twice my body weight in diet coke.
C: coke.
Companies don't know this but this is a great chance to expand their brand, it's basically free advertising
this is a great video
Here in the uk we just call it juice
Here in the uk we just call it juice
If we are looking health wise don’t touch diet sodas a lot of time especially Diet Coke, Pepsi or any of the big companies since they contain aspertain  in high volumes which isn’t healthy at all
“you’ve probably never heard of- food lion” We’ve got one on like every corner???
Oh god I remember that sans is Ness episode. The memes and fallout it created was top tier

Okay, you got me, good one MatPat!    oh god he’s serious.
Way too excited seeing the NC Sodas making a run. Harry Teets ALL DAYYYY
you don't live in los angeles!?
I am very offended that dr pepper isn't considered a cola
Personally i like barr soda
Matpat: I QUIT Diet Coke! Me: Wait... That's heresy!
Can I come visit you and sip Cola on the porch?  Also, I can't believe how married you two are :-p
IMPOSSIBLE
I was and still am C, Coke
I refuse to believe the title
HEH??!??!!?!?
Diet Crystal Pepsi made a come back a few years ago just for a bit, I got some and really liked it.  I like that it taste like Pepsi and is clear so it does not stain your teeth as bad.
Everyone knows sprite cranberry is the best
This is gonna be my first ever comment that you are gonna read and i dont know what to say. I am 7 and I have a crazy wish that you could come to my restaurant Kaytlee in Pakistan.

You should have blindfolded Matt for Zevia.
Ok wait I just read the title and are you the real matpat
My friends kept on telling me I have a soda addiction I dont know why *continues to drink my 239 soda of the day*
I'm coke gang
diet coke is disqualified because it has 1 calorie lol
You posted this video exactly 2 weeks early mat
I'm from Canada and we call it pop. At least in BC. Not sure about the other provinces.
Well I like stevia
B
No dont stop drinking diet coke . of all the things you can change this is the thing that you wanna change       NEVER EVER QUIT DIET COKE
I'm a pop guy
I heard that diet sodas are worse for you than regular soda because rather than not adding sugar they keep the sugar and add a chemical that breaks down the sugar. I'm not sure though if it's true or if it is, how bad is this chemical. But it is the only thing I can think about when someone talks about diet soda.
Food Lion? Why not keep the name Delhaize?
Texans: "here in Texas we call it Coke Sody Pop."
Wait Dr. Pepper isn’t cola, what have I been drinking?????
a
Not me living like two towns away from them-
As someone who lives in North Carolina and just learned today that Harris Teeter was founded here, I now feel extremely proud of myself knowing that NC finally did something interesting.
As a Diet Coke stan in SoCal, I now have to track down the Harris Teeter soda.
Deit soda is the worst for you they add tons of sugar to cover up the taste
Diet Coke just lost MatPat's sponsorship
1st of all, finally! Diet Coke is chemically one of the most dangerously unhealthy drinks there is.  I'd say, start watering down your sodas with carbonated or Seltzer water, make use of those mix match machines some places have now. And eventually grow a taste for flavored seltzer like Bubly.   Edit: now I'm seeing the video 🤦🏻‍♂️  Nevermind you fiend.
LIAR
MatPat likes food now
I thought diet soda had more surger than normal soda.
Where’s my Tar Heels people out there
Omg I never knew this day will come
Diet Coke must stay
When the impostor is sus
Here in Britain we just say the name of whatever we want eg can I have a sprite? Yes.
YOU DIDN'T
I feel that Coke will not sponsor MatPat again after this
One word: Blasphemy
So Mat on one of your videos on film theory (I think) you said something about “Popcorn being the most rare food ever” or something like that  when’s that coming along? Edit: also I’m an ohioan so I’m a pop kinda guy
Since Matpat likes watered down diet coke (that is what fountain is), cut the middle man and just drink water.
Soda so I’d say RotoRoll a soda
A is what I use all the time
I say pop
I am a soda sir
I'm from missouri and I've always called it soda.
I cal it soda but I live in the south and people do call it Coke😏but my house doesn't really have soda, my family doesn't buy it we drink sweet tea because Texas
I had no clue Food Lion was from NC.  We have a few here in Ohio.
<3
Coke
Why is MA MA capitalized in March madness until he description?
kroger is at pick n saves. im in wisconsin and there are tons of them in our area
*Coca Cola sales plummet by 80%.*
Matpat- "No one has heard of Food Lion" Me, a literal Food Lion employee: 😐
Wait mat pat stopes drinking diet coke in 2020 and then well all that things happen coincidence I think not
So what is the answer to the screen glitch puzzles?
Ok so we moldovans  call soda (translated) sweet. Water. I cannot make this up
Haha! Jokes on you Mat! I actually do know what food lion is as we used to have one in my hometown in the state of Georgia.
Hey MatPat its my Birthday today today🎁🎉! I Just want to say my favorite soda is Root Beer.Also for me its B: soda. Also I live in the south.
Good, Diet Coke causes Cancer anyway.
Matpat quits Diet Coke.  Me: I have looked at all the scenarios with the Infinity Stone of Time, and I did not expect this to happen.
this is so close to addiction its scary
Ah yes the "north Carolina based super market food lion" a small local shop you've probably never heard of TOTALLY TOTALLY NOT Belgium based worldwide retail giant delhaize group
You quit Diet Coke  That’s a real double Baltic moment
Impossible
@ min 1:57 and before we go any further I need to register my vote for DDP aka Diet Dr. Pepper.
Do you include a pallet cleanser with these kinds of taste tests? Also maybe a loosers bracket, might shake things up a bit for testing
Pop all the way!
Wait I thought this was Food Theory not Soda Reviews
😮
The balance has shifted, as reality’s break apart and matpats lust for Diet Coke vanishes the world collapses around him, matpat has single-handedly destroyed YouTube and soon... the world
Still watching the episode, but have you considered TAB? I know it's kind of a meme but... It's basically just an older flavor of diet coke.
What was with the screen flash at like 8:13?
Just don't drink soda… it's very unhealthy.
9:35  dont know if you included one there but there is a cocacola green which is essentialy cocacola sweetened with stevia, wonder how those two would compare.
Root beer is good
Lmao this is a funny idea nice clickbait    wait what
Sorry MatPat, I like regular Coke, not the diet version. Don’t like the taste of it. But I do find it funny about how much you like Diet Coke
Gotta drink Orange Cream Soda
MatPat: Now you’ve probably never heard of Food Lion... Me, who lives in Georgia with my Food Lion MVP card: ....okay
try Guaraná Antarctica, it's a soda from Brazil
This is the most important YouTube video for Matpat, come on we’ve all waited for this.
Pop/Soda/Coke/other names in Minnesota  are exactly how you'd expect. generally it's just soda. In the comfort of my own home, where nobody else may hear, though, I call it spiky juice.

*Sees title * Me: Impossible
Wow
As a North Carolina original, Food Lion soda is abnormally goood
Matpat:I quit diet coke Me:who are you and what have you done to matpat
Hes like talking food lion down like noone has ever heard of one outside NC but like I have on efive mind away in va
Fizzy drinks. Representing Ireland
It’s oddly ironic that the second he stopped drinking Diet Coke the world goes to poop!
yeah hes on durgs again guys i think hes on lots of drugs so he quit diet coke
Its pop
MatPat: "I'm quitting Diet Coke!" Me: O_O "My life is a lie!!"  Edit: Thank you so much for all of the likes!
This a prank right?
I’m from the Midwest as well and we always called it soda! Interesting
I feel like the fabric of time just split because matpat stopped drinking diet coke
Soda
7:47 He said pouring. Get your mind out of the gutter
https://youtu.be/o-ZQXkEWOek y
I couldn’t care less about coke but Mat and Steph reviewing coke? Definitely watching that
I typically refer to it as "soda" but it's always interesting to see how other people refer to these sorts of drinks.
NO! HOW COULD YOU ABANDON THE ANCIENT WAYS
I was not expecting you to mention Food-4-Less! That has the absolute best cherry coke I've ever had!
Do a theory on how dangerous Diet soda is in general
13:31 ??? what is this  can someone explain (maybe it is a secret code message thing)  it is like a flashing yellow green red thing
I share a similiar problem to Mat when it comes to coca cola.  Except unlike his obsession with diet coke, mine is with original coke
A) Harry Teet’s store brand hits it out of the park on a LOT of products. I specifically suggest their hot cocoa. B) Another cola brand to try is Hansen’s. My mom swears by their regular cola, though she has to order it from Amazon. The brand was recently purchased by Coca Cola, too!
Mat has been brainwashed by FNaF:Making him believe Diet Coke isn’t better then HARRIS TEETER’S DIET COKE!!
Isn't there a chemical in diet drinks that actually makes it worse for you than the regular?
Yo I know about the power of the store brand. Before Kroger left the triangle in NC I would stay drinking their Fruit Punch
Well, now I need to stop in a Harris Teeter when I'm in the South again :P
And this was the touching underdog story of the Harris Teeter coke
WHAT?  I can't believe that soda fountain, bottled, and canned Diet Coke are different.  Oh, wait, I buy diet pop for use as a household cleaning liquid and not for drinking.  So what do I know?  :)
Hey you yes YOU, want to try some german engineered coke? With the maximum legal allowed dose of caffeine? Dont worry Fritz-Kola got your back ;) www.fritz-kola.de/en/
Mat pat makes sans is ness video: Steph "What did it cost" Matpat "everything"
I wonder if he just enjoys the taste of diet soda more or if it's for dietary purposes.
Pretty sure Food Lion isn't exclusive to North Caroline since there's one 5 minutes from me in Virginia and there's one near my Mamma's house in Alabama. So I'd say south-east?
T- Tooournament ARCCCC

As a purple grape once said: IMPOSSIBLE

Sodas of the world: IRRELIVANT
Wow this is a cool video
If Steph and Matt's second favorite was Diet Coke and their third and first were opposite to each other.... Doesn't that make Diet Coke the winner overall?
In the uk it’s know as fizzy drinks
What is with the color bars at 13:30? Is there a clue here for something?
Diet Coke SUCKS. Sorry it had to be said. LoL 😂
0_o OMG u finally r dropping diet coke. But u r staying with aspartame colas so I'm sad. I quit cola yrs ago n never drink aspartame.
Pop
No THARE IS NO PIB if you know what that is
Coke Zero is my personal favourite
B: Soda
People in the comments don't seem to understand how monumental this is
He’s quitting Diet Coke?! What alternate reality am I in?
B soda
NOOOOO NOOO GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO
what is that green flash at 13:31
3:44 turn on subtitles
As someone who recently moved to NC and didn’t know about food lion or Harris teeter...thank you 🙏   Also, soda. 👌
Best part: all of the sodas can be considered as tax write offs
Every time I watch food theory I always get hungry thus I make toast with cinnamon on it to make me not hungry
When I saw this video I couldn't believe it
It's just a midlife typical crisis Mat. The nolvelty would worn of and you will be back to the safety of Coke eventually... 😏😉🤣
Me after seeing title: impossible
SODA but I’ve lived all over
4:05 glich someone tell me EDIT: LIKE TELL ME WAHT IT SAID XD
Wait, Food Lion is regional?
From living in NC for my life, 16 years, it has pretty good food lion brand food.
I would not be surprised if Harris Teeter now sees an increase in sales because of this
Does anyone else call fountain drinks, fresh squeezed soda? Like "Lemme get a fresh squeezed diet coke!"
あああぁh
Wow he removed flavored versions and the one flavored with citrus won. It would be interesting to also try different flavored soda.
pause at 23:15 and count how many you recognize
Fountain versions always taste different and even taste different depending on where you get it a McDonald's fountain will taste different than a 7/11 fountain.
All soda is Coke, there is no soda or pop, just coke.
Yay
Poor people/cheapskates all over the country already knew that store brand soda pops are just as good, if not better, than the brand name ones.
this makes me thirsty
8:10 video error that gave me a heart attack
what the blip around 9:43?
fizzy because we use the actual language
*impossible*
Diet Coke is to Matt as water is to me 🤣 I can pick out little differences in different brand waters just as easily as Matt does with coke because ALL I drink is water 🤣🤣
You’re in North Carolina?? Why did I think you lived in southern California?
You should do this same format but with other items, for example 'best pizza'
"lemme explain the taste....not good" 10/10 review I gotta say
Impossible
Wow wait a second is matt pat even Matt pat even more.
MatPat: I **QUIT** Diet Coke! Also MatPat: **anyways, I started drinking Coke: Diet Edition**
The couple's goals at 18:19;-;
It's a coke. Sprite flavored coke, Pepsi flavored coke, Coke flavored coke (Coke Classic), the possibilities are endless!  Also, as a North Carolinian (and a fellow Harnett Countian, Stephanie), I assume you've tried Coke Classic in GLASS BOTTLES with roasted peanuts dropped in the bottle. It would be awesome to see an episode on the history of how that came to be a tradition. And/or other states'/regions' food traditions!
13:30 What was that?
6:10 No no, Steph has a point. Yes, we have Publix, and technically we are part of the Southeast, but Florida is it’s own region. Like Texas.
I like root bear so, soda?
Plot twist: Diet Coke quits Matt Patt
Have many stores here in Sweden that sell different types of Soda, but not near as many types of Coca Cola like USA does, it feels insane seeing all these different types of just one version of Cola
Things Matt is known for online: -He's (one of) the FNaF guy(s)  -He wears that red jacket -He's the origin of the Sans/Ness meme -He gave the Pope a copy of Undertale -He likes Diet Coke -He really likes Diet Coke -He like, really, really, _really_ likes Diet Coke -He killed the guy who runs Random Encounters using a chainsaw -He likes Rick and Morty -He once simultaneously Whipped and Nae Naed
This is the best underdog story! Like, some kid asked to join the Olympics, and for a laugh everyone agreed, but they ended up winning!!???
Sometimes the unexpected winner was the one that wasn't ment to be there.
Rc cola
Quitting cola sounds hard. Like me with 7up free. Plus it's pop here in the UK
Look real close 4:04
substitude for Diet Coke? How about drinking Water? I heard its really healthy and super tasty
Pop
I personally call it pop and soda
Gfuel replaced my soda addiction.
watching you two do rock paper scissors in the beginning was like watching a couple of cave-men lolol
Me clicking the video: "please don't be clickbait please don't be clickbait"
Matt you were supposed to destroy the harris teeter not join them
The normal theory sentence coke, because i live in Florida, aka the country next to the gulf of Mexico, and Mexico makes fresco.

“I quit Diet Coke.” *I M P O S S I B L E*
Impossible
Me: see's title. Also me: WHO THE HECK IS THIS?!?!?! THIS ISN'T MATPAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Wut
Diet soda means diet fizzy drinks not diet cola...
As someone who works for Publix, I'm sad we didn't win, but at least we got featured. Mad respect.
i am soda
The best super market without a dought is     Fis     Its a europe thing
I saw the thumbnail and freaked out cuz I thought Mat was quitting Food Theory XD
B gang
Funny comment
I honestly thought that everybody had a Harris Teeter, where I live there seems to be one around every corner.
Soda 🥤
Why am I getting hype for a soda bracket?
This is the day or reckoning
Hey, Did anyone notice the weird color blip at 00:13:31 ? I've been playing around with the colors and getting some weird results...
Plot twist food lion is in Virginia
In Bulgaria literally translated is without Alcohol
What about glass bottle coke?
finding out you prefer the store brand is like a poor person lottery. yeehaw 79 cents for my coke
MATPAT
What
MatPat = Diet Coke simp
I was expecting him to stop his path to diabetes :(
here there is a interesting fact that they doesn't have on count or in the video never tell, some sodas or coke are WAY too better when have ice or ar cold , idk i think is a thing on them that when is cold changes the flavor significantly
Strawberry and watermelon tango or pepsi max my dude
Bro they be pulling out big words to describe coke.
I’m NC born and raised and I call them “soft drinks”😅
I call it brus... I am Norwegian
In boylan's defense cola is not their speciality Birch Beer and root beer is... also their old-timey practices are prone to produce bad batches every once in awhile.
The fruity taste was unknown juices
D. other (Fizzy drinks or the name of the drink)
You know, it's kind of ironic you chose the fountain version. According to Rhett and Link in a Good Mythical Morning episode, the Fountain version sucks.
It’s pretty interesting how citric acid makes a difference in things
Diet Coke: "Who are you?!"  Harris Teeter (with the 0 to Hero protagonist storyline): "DEATH."
COKE OR COLD DRINK
Food Lion is also know as Hannaford. Both are owned by Delhaize America.
Coke zero with a slice of lime, boom, ya got the citric acid that's so good and she can have her plain coke zero.
I choose D other im a water man
so this is like the 3rd video that i have seen that has a split second of a completley green screen that covers them and has nothing to do with them, this one is at 8:10
this is basically me with Vanilla pepsi and mountain dew
Where's my Coke gang
Fitness theory
E
Unsubbed
Did anyone else notice the glitches throughout the whole video? DEFINITELY some ARG stuff
In the Appalachian South its Sodi-pop, Sodi-water, Dope(yep Dope is used for soda), Pop, Coke or just soda depending on who are you are and where in the Hills(mountains) you are located I just call it soda.
You know that calories is basically fuel measurement so basically you are putting nothing into your human fuel tank
Matpat I quit diet soda me click pait
The can should come straight from the can. It’s not fair for it to be poured
Why does the coke in the thumbnail look fake?
Root beer is king
"this was not on the list this morning, however it has bested every single one" *f a t e ?*
Well this is a shocker when I saw the title of the video
I love this video
no, florida isn't in the southwest of the us, florida in in florida
Rep Harris teeters
dono  yō    ittai kora ga  kanōdearu ka  sore wa hontō  no fucanōde  wa  arimasen  means  how the heck is this possible no its is not real  impossible  yeah i know japanese so  japyon
is it just me or does anyone else get a flash of green when Steph say turpentine at 8:08
My family is a Zevia house. I’m offended by your meanness to the sacred drink
I don't know how popular it is in the US (if at all), but we have Spezi in Germany, wich is basically a mix of cola and orange soda. It still has the cola taste, but it's less acidic and a little fruity.
If your in North Carolina you have to have diet cheer wine even if it goes against the rules
Sees title: clearly clickbait.  Finishes video: Okay, i was wrong
D: other
Actually it doesn't surprise me that Steph prefers Coke zero over light. It's a thing that has been happening in a lot of places, including here in Belgium. Coke zero sells more, while the Coke light sales have plummeted ever since it appears. Though then again, I doubt the Coca-cola company cares, since they're both their products. :-D
not sponsered by ALL THE DRINKS IN THIS VIDEO
Diet soda is bad for you in general why not just drink regular soda? Tastes better and is better for you
Food Lion is in my state as well
Steph's face as Mat chooses HT over DC.
Me, living in Florida: Whoa! Florida is in the Southwest?? Is that just a theory?
I am only a food theorist and don’t watch any of the other channels so all the other references were lost on me. I know you like the Diet Cokes tho
Food Lion gang💪🏻
It's funny how this video taught me that "delhaize" in belgium is called "food lion" in america
This is the best Cinderella story
I call it Soda (born and living in California), but my dad (also born and living in California) calls it coke, despite calling it soda for nearly all of his life
Now this title made me click so fast
I'm actually glad the Kroger-owned brand won out. I, myself, drink Kroger's Big K Diet Orange Soda, and NONE of the major label orange sodas taste anywhere near as good to me. Well done, Kroger.
have you tried Coke Zero
I'll always be a Shasta man
The thing that company's have the same product with different names for different shops is also a thing here in Portugal. Or at least that's what I heard. It's just a theory.
I am soda
Will this become just like Mark Vs Del Monte? xD
no RC Cola?!?!?!?!?!?
AntMan: "What happens here"
Corona is real do not take it for granted
Eat your cereal
QUIT Diet Coke D: but that's your bro/pal/friend etc... But interesting experiement/study, sounds like a dream for you xD I go with Steph's preference at the end, my bros drink that mostly (Coke Wise). Plus side, you got a whole load of Soda Drinks in the house to go along with your bread pile xD Keep being awesome & safe bros!🥤 😎 👊  1:03 👀 xD 1:30 Shut up Professor xD 2:44 👀 x/ 3:23 👀 6:20 Deep for Bropat xD 10:40 Coke Zero 👌14:25 👀 xD 15:23 👀 Steph xD 15:28 Neither.... Not allowed to have much fizzy drinks 17:05 👀 👌17:38 👀 18:18 👀 xD 20:15 Steph xD 👌23:54 👀 xD
Coke-cola:  Oh wait, he didn't choose us...  QUICK!  MAKE A FLAVOR WITH CITRUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#TEAMCOFFIE!!!
I'm from Philadelphia We call it soda And the soda of choice..... Pepsi
I literally got a Pepsi zero sugar ad on this video Right before the round it was featured in, how crazy is that lmao
Please win diet coke
I haven’t even watched this yet, but I’m calling bs.
Soda
About time
Pop
I think stephpat is gone next week, i think she was lying about leaving. sure doesn't seem like it
D
Hold up so steph said she likes coke? just gonna record that
In Michigan we call it "pop"
Of course its Kroger the winner. GMM mention, and liked it, so many times, that, its a legit stuff.
Coronavirus
I LIKE LIME KOKOLA
13:29 ARG fans.... Is this something???
Corona
Diet Coke’s sales go down 100000%
Coke zero > pepsi max > diet coke imo
Everyone around me says Pop, I've always said Soda.
I am a B. Soda.
I actually really like the zevia, but specifically the ginger ale one,
In Canada we call it Fizzy Bibbly
I say soda, but I know some around here who say soda pop
As a person who lives in North Carolina and has a severe soda addiction, this was a pretty cool episode.
THE OG DIET COKE LOVER OUR GOD HISSS NAME ISSSS matpat
Cream soda is good   And if you mix a bit of orange soda oh my God it’s great Add some ice cubes crushed.  I can’t drink diet anything it’s not that I’m allergic to it just tastes wrong it tastes like blasphemy.
Matthew Patthew
I’m from the south so C O K E
Going to have to pick C. I grew up in the Mid-South, near Memphis, and all sodas were referred to (at least at the time) as coke.
Also, also... I don't think it was fair to have fountain Diet Coke and all the rest either cans or bottles... That's just me, though. I mean, you're not buying fountain Diet Coke at the store, right?
Mat is every woman on tinder.
Someone who doesn't watch him  Oh that one theory guy
Food Lion is actually in here in Georgia (where we say "coke"), too. And it's funny you chose Kroger because I was just about to type, "You forgot Big K!"  If you're looking for other brands, if you can get your hands on them, there's one called Stars & Stripes (which comes in a HUGE 3 liter) and another called Faygo.
The Harriss Teter coporation will be wondering why their sales suddenly jumped and the sodas are going off the shelves
The biggest controversy since 9/11
Whoo-hoo! North Carolina for the win!
NOOOO THE REIGN OF THE COKE OF THE DIET IS OVERRR
Title: "I QUIT Diet Coke!"  Me: "MATPAT I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE"  Edit: Why do you keep tasting the bad ones? Like every time one of them is really bad you keep taking extra sips! Why?
Mat: *I like this cola*  *but I like this one better*
I thought 2020 was bad.
It’s soda you Neanderthals
Soft drink/ fizzy drink in Devon uk
do a thory on raft
this is obviously fake mattypatty will never giveup the nectar of the gods
*Sips Diet Dr Pepper
Me: sees title*  *IMPOSSIBLE!!!! I've seen it all now* *I was preparing for this, SEND IN THE NUKESSS!!!!!*  *CODE RED, CODE RED, I REPEAT CODE REDDD!!!!!!!*
Want a new soda              FANTA:)
Kroger diet pop is sooooo good its sad that I quit soda tho rip
your camera is glitching a tiny bit
0:38 And also pissed of Persona and Hazbin Hotel fans.
D: Fizzy Drink   …no…just me?
Matpat: quits diet coke. Diet coke: (bonds with fnaf to seek revenge)
B
From Philadelphia my family says "Soda" because it represents any carbonated soft drink.
Cherry Coke is way better
Impossible
I don’t drink cola and never have but we call “pop” or “soda” a fizzy drink
What's that @13:30😱
OOOOOOH MY GOD! WHAT A TWIST! I genuinely didn’t expect this! This was an incredible tournament!
How is this video not sponsored by  Coca Cola lol
i haven't been this entertained about soda since that time britney, beyoncé and pink sang we will rock you
Traitor I actually thought I found a fellow Diet Coke lover
Quitting soda in general is a good idea. It’s liquid candy.
Once I have bought a store brand cola and it was bad, really terrible.
How dare you put Pepsi
I use "pop" or "soda" rather interchangeable but probably leaning more towards "soda"
First off its called soda
1:24  me sipping on my normal coke and watch this me: why you gotta call me out on my morning juice
Pop
did anyone else notice the flashes of light that appeared twice in the video?
Dr. Pepper. Don't care that it's not included. Fight me.
15:30 just call it a drink
you got on 3 with rock paper scissors, not 4
Whats with the uppercase MAs in March and madness and WA in watch i feel there may be something there
My brother calls soda bubbly stuff
I have the absolute solution for ya, NO SODA AT ALL!
I’ve been watching mat for so long, always hearing him rant about the Diet Coke, and-and- and-... I just have no words. I am astonished and... I- I don’t know.
Aspartame is a carcinogen. Just gonna leave this here.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA for all my Canadians
Don’t judge Boylan on the cola their Birch Beer is fucking AMAZING
Never liked canned cola and canned diet cola is even worse. My favorite is Schweppes cola (not diet) it's honestly the best. Second is Pepsi cola (not diet).
My 2 favourite drinks are root beer and sprite
b
Pop man fs
I don't drink much soda, but pepsi zero is pretty good.  also, I think all sodas taste better when in a can (with the exception of  bottled root beer in a glass bottle)
How Matt has fallen
soda
First final you give up Diet Coke that stuff has more sugar than regular coke second I recommend Jones cane sugar soda it’s really good
D other: where I'm from, we all just call them fizzy drinks or the actual name.
Early in life, my canadian father called it pop, but I later started calling it soda
get your before 500K views ticket here.
I’m a soda guy
My mind cannot comprehend that Matt did not choose diet coke
Honestly coca cola should just get mat pat to make his own diet coke.
15:29 that's gonna be a 🅱️ from me
All we buy in our family is food lion brand soda. It’s inexpensive and very tasty. Wife loves the diet.
I think he's trying to send us a secret message with the Glitchy had am I have to do with Dad
You should do a game theory on March Mammal Madness the March madness of the animal world
I imagine It's very confusing for tourists in Scotland to hear coke and other soda being called 'juice' lol. Either juice or fizzy drink, basically if it's something a kid can drink that's not milk, it's juice.
Where I am in Canada a lot of us use soda and pop interchangeably. I think I PERSONALLY use pop more but I hear both pretty often
Pop
Boyland’s Cane Sugar Cola is actually a great alternative to classic Coca Cola.  My sister and I get it every now and then when we feel in a good mood. True it’s a bit pricy, especially since it’s a four bottle pack, not a six, but it’s worth the money. Though for my money, I’ll always go for Regular Vanilla Coke whenever the chance to get it arises. I don’t like Orange-Vanilla or Cherry-Vanilla. Regular Vanilla hits my balance of classic Coke flavor with a dash of sweet vanilla. Especially when it comes from a fountain machine. That’s when it’s at its absolute best. ^^  Also where I’m from, it’s Soda.
Dont quit it, the nectar from the gods shouldnt be taken lightly
This video was totally clickbait XD but hilarious and fun to watch nonetheless
Mezo mix, best soda ever. Sadly it's only in Europe. I miss it
So what’s going on with 13:31?
Impossible
My school is "Limenka" it's a Croatian Word for can, it's a slang for ordering coke at a bakery just next to the schoolyard.
#fakenews
THIS EPISODE! Is why these two are married. Case and point: the rock paper scissors game. But this isn't a theory
Food Lion is from belgium
Also, Wegmans diet cola is pretty good, and the diet... "Dr Pepper" or whatever is really good.
Rich people be like: 3:51.
isn't consuming large amounts of a certain soda drink something a lot of alcoholics do before getting addicted to alcohol? I feel like I heard that somewhere, if it's true be careful yall
Wtf he like fountain diet coke
He needs Dr. Pepper
COKE ZERO GANG    Edit: SAD GANG :((
I love how I live in NC so this tournament is totally relevant to me and not confusing at all. I’ve had all of those grocery store branded sodas 😂
I didnt even know it was called anything but coke until I was 12
Lol foodlion is actually a dutch store called Delhaize but because that's a really hard word to say in english they called it foodlion and wouldn't it be a coincidence that I live in Belgium and 2 streets away is a Delhaize store I´m gonna try there coke (:
I drink a lot of rc cola.
There's a secret in this video!!!let's figure it out!!!
mainly coke, sometimes soda, occasionally soda pop, but never pop
WOW! The US has a LOT more Coca-Cola than the UK!
This is history being made
He's not wrong about the source changing the flavor..I've had Sprite from soda fountains, glass bottles, cans, and plastic bottles and they all taste different..a glass bottle being the most jarringly different in flavor..right up there with the soda fountain dispenser.
When the episode doesn't end with "But hey!  That's just a theory:"
this is some anime tournament arc bullshit
No, stop MatPat, I’m not ready for the world to end.
Citric acid is the key to immortality
When you dont live in a country with a lot of interesting soda:   *IM NOT CRYING I JUST TRIED GARLIC SODA :(*
13:31 is that some sort of ARG thing?  I can't figure out what it means but maybe someone smarter than me can
Everyone else in my state calls it pop, but I call it soda because I live in MinneSOTA.
Here in Ireland we just all them fizzy drinks
Do book theory or history theory.
Crystal Pepsi was the best Pepsi!
I have a food lion in my town in Tennessee
B
I say soada
Who else going to Harris teeter after this👌
Impossible
13:31 6th frame why is the screen yellow and green stripes
I got some of my friends into the Harris Teeter soda before covid and thats all we keep in our coolers.
I grew up with Choice B: "Soda"
TRATOR
Honestly I'm more coke zero kind of guy
Try coffie It'll make you even smarter!!!
Definitely a pop kinda guy here ✊
B. Soda, easy, simple, straight forward
Nooooooo
Coke 0 is the best Cola I've ever had
Hmm, Frys is my local market, and if I were a diet soda, or even a soda in general, drinker, I would give it a try.
I recommend Malta
After years of free advertisement, Diet Coke has just lost its biggest supporter
pop
D: Other. Here in Germany where I grew up all sweetened, carbonated beverages are summarized as "Limonade" aka lemonade. And we usually call Coke just "Cola".
Tbh I hate coke zero. It doesn't taste anything like the normal coca cola which I love
I'll give him a month.
Next theory: The Truth About Citric Acid
you could just stop drinking soda except for special occasions like holidays
Me: * sees a thumbnail with Matpat pouring out a can of diet coke * Me: Something's not right...
Up here in Canada Pop and Soda are two very different things.
I am also from the Midwest, but I call it soda
they said it couldn't be done
I grew up with pop in Illinois, but living in New York for over 2 decades I'm a soda guy, now.
i only exclusively drink coke cola, so coke
I wish you did chubby cola soda
Next video which insulin companies is better
at first glance i though i misread the title
So is this a reboot of the series?
this reminds me of The Rank King Eugene
SHUN HIM!!! SHUUUUUUUUNNNNNN HIIIIIMMMMM!!!!!!!
Matt: *doesn't pick Diet Coke* Steph: *surprised Pikachu face*
Wait. I thought you guys live in California??
Matpat NOOO Fountain Diet Coke tastes like D.Pepsi!
People who call it Soda-Pop: *Some men just want to watch the world burn*
rip diet coke
Steph: It's citric acid. Coke: Write that down, write that down!
I am myself a fizzy drink sort of guy
I live in North Carolina! I know publix food lion Harris teeter. In fact, my family shopped at food loin all the time until they finally built a walmart
So does the rest of the Kroger sodas taste the same?
Matt would make a great salesman
Our queen Steph is looking beautiful as ever 💕💕💕
Sadly for me, ALL the artificial sweeteners are AWFUL!  Can't stand them.  I always get this awful aftertaste after just a small amount of intake and it just ruins it for me.
Never quit Diet Coke
Early!
:O I usted to drink food lion's cola back in South Carolina
Colonel, something is wrong here. Why would matpat quit diet coke?
March Matness is so much more interesting to me than March Madness. Haven't finished the video, so I am (metaphorically) on the edge of my seat.
Now for them to do some unbiased soda taste testing of different orange sodas (Fanta/Sunkist for example) and different 'lemon-lime' sodas (Mountain Dew/Mountain Lightning). I'd like to see their opinions.
If you didn’t take a sneak peek to the end and watched the whole video through, congratulations
Matpat quitting diet coke😳!!!!! Is the world ending
It was nice to see Steph take such an active role in this one, especially since we won't be seeing her as much on GTlive.
Who is Mathew? /s
MATPAT WHERE IS YOUR BEARD RIRBISVDIEBEJNSKRDIWPQHDIDN
Coke
When are you going to do potato chips, you know, the most "bang for your buck"
It’s confirmed I saw the title the world is ending
Harris Teeter: Sales are skyrocketing
As soon as they said they like the “sweet coke” I immediately knew that was fountain. Fountain poured drinks are always sweeter! I’m so hyped that I called that!
The end of an age.
I don't drink soda. But this was interesting.
B, but I was born in C land.
I’m with steph. It’s all just coke...
Soda!
Here in the uk we call it Fizzy drinks
From the midwest, but im a soda man
I love how mat is describing this like a boxing match
14:40 umm they have food lion in Georgia
B
Now I’m going to have to try Fry’s soda
*weeps at mention of coke life* It was so good... and now it's gone...
Matt is a Harris teeter enthusiast
Mat- “ A North Carolina Grocery Store”  Me screaming “FOOD LION!”
Never getting that Diet Coke. sponsorship now.
yall seen the glitch at 13:31?
ive never rooted for Harris Teeter harder in my life
You should really try Boylans Birch Beer. It's delicious! Obviously won't work for your video, but just try it!
Soda
This is a sign of the apocalypse
I don't believe this
diet coca cola sales drop by 99%
7up  it is the answer  it is the savour it is better than everything also it looks like water and isn't sh*t coloured
Cole Zero is a million times better, you can't change my mind.
Team Theorist is killing it this year with theories! Love this one ❤
D
And the last teir is why you don't identify the soda until the end.
"diet" soda - one of the biggest lies ever. there is nothing diet with that stuff
Partial Clickbait!!!!!!!!!
Diet A&W Root Beer is my go-to.
When I saw glitches I started going frame by frame for hidden messages.
Steph's progressive shock as he continues to go on about this new and unexpected love for the Harris Teeter Cola, is just hilarious. 😂  Also I love that it seems like fate that the Teeter Cola ended up on the ballot last minute, just to win out in the end. It was meant to be, Mat! It was meant to be! Also hella convenient for y'all, since it's cheaper and from the closest place to your house. So that's a bonus too.👍
Impossible
Matthew you privileged man I wish I had access to Coca-Cola Life
In Oklahoma I call it coke, but my hubby drinks coke cola and my mom drink diet coke. so I have to default to Dr. Pepper and/or pop around them.
This was an excuse for matpat to drink a lot more Coca Cola but in different versions
This has left me shocked...
Mat pat quitting Diet Coke that’s like bob ross being mean
Awesome! Really good ad lolololol
People who vote mat pat is the Imposter \/
I literally had a stroke when I read the title
D
Personally i’m more of a carbonated fruit water person (Spindrift is superior), i’d rather have 5 extra calories of carbonated watered down fruit juice than 0 calories of 10 times the needed sugar intake
there are different flavours of cola?!  COLA IS COLA!!!
Drama at its finest.
Diet soda is the worst soda Heath wise. Normal sodas are healthier.
Soda
15:32 I'm not from the U.S I don't speak English when I order anything
Kroger products always do well on GMM
R.I.P diet coke  May you be missed
And they said I was insane for not trusting oranges WHO'S INSANE NOW?
I say soda but I don't drink it
heriiss teter littel mac of soada
Hey MatPat here in germany we have Fritz Kola, I dont know if there is a zero version but you should check it out if you read this.
anyone else noitice that glitch at 4:06?? its like green bars
I have to go with d for us here up in Canada we just say the name of what beverage we want
Why diet soda? I thought they’re even worse than the regular one
I also grew up hearing all soda called "tonic"
Pop. No contest.
"Citric acid runs the world"  And i'm allergic to citric acid or citric juices.....so if there is too much in it i can't drink/eat it ._.
Pop all day long
I only clicked on this video to check on MatPat's mental health.
Matpat: We need one more  diet soda for our video Sees an ordinary grocery store brand diet soda  Matpat: okay I’ll take this soda just to fill a spot in the bracket. The soda is Matpat’s favorite
I just call it, trash
Is it just my phone or does the video have glitches????
PLEASE DON'T QUIT DIET COKE! IT IS THE HOLY LIQUID! HOW COULD I LIVE WITHOUT KNOWING YOU'RE PROBABLY CHUGGING A GALLON OF DIET COKE AT THAT MOMENT?! I-it just isn't the same without diet coke.
growing up in the the north west i say soda but my southern roots say cold drink
I just finished a fanart of you as the Diet Coke king.. gosh darn it
I'm drinking Sodastream Diet Cola right now...
i call it soda lol
Here in the UK, we call them fizzy drinks. That's it. Yeah, we're a bit boring over here.
I am disappointed by the fact you basically pulled me in with a video name that was clearly a false frame/false advertising. You didn't quit Diet Coke. Even your thumbnail is misleading.  You did the same with your Film Theory episode where you talked about your theory about what the Godzilla vs Kong movie is about instead of explaining why Godzilla will win, which is what the name of your video is.  Stop with the misleading video titles. Do not even try to tell me it is technically true because half-truths are even worse.
10:24 I like Pepsi zero sugar so I would love to try out the other soda,,, too bad it's most likely just in America or not available in my country since I've never seen it before
14:51 technically pepsi was also created in the Carolinas
c
Me: sees title Also me: nooooooooooo
Then Mr. Mett may I prefer you: Coke+ a bit of lemon flavored Iced-Tea or a slice of lime/lemon? I think you will like it considiring why you liked Haris Teeter.
But why
Stef is right about Florida is not being a part of the south east us
im saving this to my watch later so i can come back to this later
YOU TRAITOR!! AFTER ALL THESE YEARS YOU'RE LEAVING DIET COKE FOR SOME RANDOM FILLER SODA!!!    It wasn't even on the original list... You monster.    JK
As a North Carolinian so was so confused when Matt said that we may not know what Food Lion is.
Me: sees thumbnail  also me : this has to be a joke
I have a Kroger's in the next town Over. Though in my Personal Baised I would perfer RC or Faygo
MATPAT LIVES IN NC????  OMG I HOPE HE LIVES IN CHARLOTTE (Gotta represent my home town)
Green Cola meets all criteria and can be bought through Amazon surprisingly and it tastes on par ( or better in my case ) than most other colas
B
Glass Bottle Coke represent.  Also, they should try Mexican Coca-Cola. They use CAne sugar instead of Corn Syrup
Food theory: the story of citric acid
B
I know that the “Sans is Ness” theory gets a lot of flack, but I genuinely don’t understand why? I had no prior knowledge of the earthbound characters and thought it was a seriously cool theory with interesting points to support it that the team made well! A fave to be sure
Me when I saw the title:0
I was so excited when I saw this episode was about soda but its only about coke based sodas. I wanted you to try Sundrop which is local to North Carolina
Me, an avid coke zero drinker: HECK YEH *high fives steph* Coke zero for liiife! <3
I just saw the title but I'm guessing it's bc he realized that the sugar substitute for diet coke is super unhealthy
I feel the beginning is also partly a excuse to drink 3 times diet coke
In the part of the uk I'm from we just say drink and then specify the name and flavor of the drink. I.e. "hey what drink do you want?" " I'll have a Doctor peper and my friend will have a diet coke."
Matt:No flavor cola Also Matt: I like this cola for it's fruity undertones.
Who are you and what have you done to MatPat?
No no no, this video is title should actually be  "Matt went without diet cola for so long he now must consume massive quantities of it and find a way of justifying that to his wife and his audience.... So now he's going to do a whole episode where he does nothing but drink diet soda"    I AM ON TO YOU MATT PAT YOU CANNOT FOOL ME
Diet Coke >>>>>>>
I'll do you one better, water
Is this gonna be a nickocado avocado where they break up but they don't really break up
PICK GINGER ALE
imagine him putting lemon in his diet coke
Gotta go to my local Kroger to taste test now xD
i used to love foodlion
i live in oregon we call it soda
The undersoda
.... Whelp. Waiting for the Game Theory episode where MatPat tries to figure out which disgusting artificial sweetener gave him which crippling health disorder.
I hear Matpat talk about Boylan never changing their recipe and I think about the origin of soda and question if Boylan forgot to stop adding the medicine.
Let me explain this flavor:   Not good
You should try Fritz-Kola from the german company fritz-kulturgüter gmbh. The CEO has given himself the mission to create the best coke in the world. It has somewhat more coffein but is my favorite. Except their zero sugar coke. This one is way to sweet.
Soda!!! Freaking soda!!! That’s what I grew up with!!!! Ps. I may or may not be still growing up...
There are many food lions in va also
lets go another vid
"If you don't see your favorite diet cola in the tournament, it's because it wasn't for sale near my home." *laughs in prefers-to-avoid-diet-sodas-due-to-the-sweetener-fooling-your-body-and-increasing-the-risk-of-diabetes.*  As for what I call it, I use Soda due to having grown up in the northeast.
I am pop rock (pop)
Root beer nothing will get me off it
13:31
Why did this capture my attention for so long!! I should be working but I’m invested in the results!!!
How dare you diss Coke Life, it's so good and only gives mildly painful diarrea
#sodagang
I read the title and was like. HE WHAT
Lemonade here
Impossible... thats illegal.
makes me wish I lived in the States so I could try Harris Teeter
I had a heart attack when I saw “quit Diet Coke”
I’m British so I call it fizzy drinks now imma get some tea
RC
Pat that is the bravest decision ever
I am soda
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MATPAT PLEASE KEEP YOUR GLOIRUS DIET CKOKE
Good for you! I quit drinking sugar 8 days ago...also quit smoking weed...feeling like a million bucks! Good luck bro!
Hang on a minute, I recognize the label on that Food Lion diet cola! That's the exact same label that's used for Hannaford Brothers diet cola here in New England! I was today years old when I found out both of those supermarket chains were under the same corporate umbrella.
Pepsi Max for the win!
a
There are a couple artificial screen glitches, I wonder if it means something... 👀
Should've been blindfolded
Impossible...
I’m in the south and I don’t like coke and soda
Pop
Pepsi is the best no contest
In my family we regarded all pop/soda as bepsi, as we were arabian
Everyone: Reads the title  Also everyone: *Impossible*
Be careful of taste testing bias, this is what happened with New Coke.  You can read up on it in Freakinomics.
matpat quit diet coke and hes also quiting all food ever and will from now on eat cans of food™️ like dad
Its sodapop
What have you done with the real mat pat
MUST. DRINK. DIET. COKE.
He quit it because coca-cola refused to sponsor him lol.
At this point, Citrus Acid might be the secret to the Krabby Patty Secret Formula
I like to call that "magic in the mundane"... or your guides giving a surprise gift. This was soo much fun to watch!
Me: ooook everyone time to see if we need to change all of our memes about him and diet coke
I have a hypothesis as for why the fountain soda was sweeter: because of the concentration of syrup and flavoring agent. I’m probably wrong, but with fountain needing resupplies of flavoring agent, while in factories the syrup amount can be more uniform, if the fountain has a fresh supply of syrup, it gives it more of a cola taste.
Wait he lives in north Carolina?                   I live in North Carolina
Me as soon as I saw that title: 𝘕𝘰𝘱𝘦... 𝘕𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘪𝘯'𝘵
A bothersome thing I've noticed in a lot of your taste and smell comparison videos on this channel is that you don't pallet cleanse between samples. The human brain tends to "lock on" to certain flavors, weakening their expression, when consumed regularly. If you force your taste buds or nose to taste or smell something radically different between samples, you'll achieve a much more accurate understanding of the items being compared.  You should have kept a large glass of cold, very bitter coffee next to your sample there. You wouldn't have to drink much, just swish and spit, and allow the smell to waft into your nose to force your brain to sense "bitter" over anything "sweet" between samples, or else prior samples might taint the flavor of the next sample in line.
me oh cool food theory posted another video-  WAIT WHAT
I never thought the day would come where we got a cola review with a diet cola authority figure as trusted as MatPat
If you think I’m switching from Pepsi zero sugar to some brand I don’t know about I am sorry matpat but I can’t switch from Pepsi it just has that nectarine nectar and taste i’m sorry but Pepsi is just too good I’ve already tried that other type at Kroger I picked up once one tried and it was less than flavorful and I’m pretty sure it was the exact same company because do you know Kroger owns the store mentioned
3 days pass and suddenly Harris tetter/kroger sales go up by a noticeable % due to this video XD
I've never gotten the appeal of soda, diet soda in particular. The carbonation/acidity always hurt my tongue and made it hard to taste anything. Add to that diet's lack of flavor, I just prefer tap water.
No... it can't be.... Edit: It wasn't
I think fountain drinks being sweeter is true across the board. I love root beer but even when they’re both from the same brand, I like bottled over fountain. Root beer is already pretty sweet, fountain is too much.
his response to coke never sponsoring a video: his final attempt
I drink Diet Water.  Just for the taste of it, Diet Water!  Diet Coke is disgusting.  Even if aspartame and caramel coloring were good for my health, I'd still refuse to drink it.  Taylor Swift drinks Diet Coke, and that's why she's skinny.  The disgustingly oversweetened chemical flavor destroys her appetite, and that's why she doesn't eat more.  OK, OK, I'm just using the same talking point people have used for not trusting my taste in food.  :)
In England we call them Fizzy Drinks
What if the secret Krabby Patty Formula has citric acid in it?
me oh cool food theory posted another video-  WAIT WHAT
Tell me you blended them together after filming them and drank it.
Family reunion!
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE REAL MATTPAT!
14:39 over here In Maryland  theres several of dem food lions
Am I the only one that's been noticing those weird green bands flickering on the video? What's up with those? :/
I’ve heard of Food Lion, there are a few here in PA
I hate soda. I hate coffee. I'm probably the weirdest person in the first world.
I will stand with my combination of 1 bottle of diet coke and 1 bottle of coke zero when I drink soda xD
I AM SHOOK
Thank you ❤️
I have the same issue with mat but I am in love with Coca-Cola zero
Wait. No. Stop. Why would you judge sodas on taste insetad of the amount or feel of bubbles? Bubbles are 75% of the reason to drink a soda.
Matpat: The north carolina-based supermarket Food Lion which you've probably never heard of Me who has a family that regularly shops at food lion: A FOOLISH MISCALCULATION
MatPat: I quit Diet Coke Everyone: Impossible...
what impposible
When you live in the Midwest and drink nothing but Meijer brand cola and Verners ginger ale
I really can't stand the taste of diet soda. It has a weird aftertaste that just makes my taste bud go blah. The closest thing I can drink is soda with a zero brand. It tastes close enough to the original, but it's still kind of has that off taste to it still. But I do prefer the taste of the original sodas. Although I can say from being quarantined so long, I hate the taste of plain water. If there's no flavor additive, even lemon juice, my taste will Hate it.
There's a reason why there is no Diet Coke in France and ONLY Coke Zero. It's just so much better !!
Food Lion is actually across the eastern coast i believe. It is in Maryland at least.
Am I going crazy or is anyone else seeing weird artifactson the video at around 4:05? This isn't the first video I noticed this on and I also saw it on my phone
Watch them endorse you now lol
Wait wat
Carbo  is what I called it for the longest time then started calling it soda
B
I am from the south as well so it is all coke
I'm not having this. If the cola is clear you need to do the experiment in an opaque container
we called it a fizzy doodad
Coke is going to go out of business now
My heart skipped two beats when I saw I quit diet coke
Food lion is more mainstream, Maryland has em too, my main grocery store
Hi
I think instead of Rock Paper Scissors you should've done which price is better cuz thats what you will buy more
Huh
Why am i sooo invested in harris teeter winning
what happened on this frame 4:06
I'm soda
mhmmm, diet soda is no more
Mat pat: Quit Diet Coke  Me: that’s illegal
Spoiler alert: diet coke lost so I was shocked then I thought that mat is going to make new soda jokes 😁
So mat pat basically ripped off rhett and link's march madness
can't wait to try out Marranos diet coke to see if it is good
Now I want a theory on Mountain Dew, even if it will ruin it for me.
"We at food theorists do not support mass consumption of diet coke despite *matt's inexplicable ability to drink gallons on an hourly basis* "
I'll be that guy, Coke Zero tastes like metal and gives me migraines. I ditched it in my freshman year of high school and refuse to look back.
Good luck...
soda
Funnily I learned bout the coke thing in the south today in social studies which is a coincidence but it’s still weird.
I grew up in South Carolina, the heart of the South, and we all called it soda. NO ONE in my area ever called soft drinks "Coke" as a blanket term.
Mat: Up in the Midwest, we call it pop. Me, a Midwesterner, sipping on a soda: _Excuse me?_ I guess the Midwest is not a unified front in the battle of the soft drinks.
The rock paper scissor moment made me laugh so hard, that synchronization was *IMMACULATE*
So start Inviting in Kroger Got It 👍🏼
Please tell me that this is a filler episode
I'm not a soda guy, but this is entertaining
Are these sodas even cold 🧐
When it comes to boylan bottling though stick to the root beer lol
Did anyone else notice the green line around 4:10
Pop here in NY
20:53 HER FACE ALDHLFPJSD
Well you're certainly not getting that Diet Coke sponsorship now
BRB heading to the Harris Teeter next to my house to replace my coke zero :P
Fizzy juice. Obviously.
Coke
Haha very funny MatPat but we know you’re lying
I live right next to a Krogers OMG
Aspartame gets a bad wrap. It's honestly not going to be consumed in high enough quantities daily to really affect us, despite what other countries say. Here is a video by a chemist with better info on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpmQRHq4qmQ. Matpat disappointed you'd fearmonger like that when you love science, my dude. Poor show.
Now I need March Matness every March in The Food Theorists. I promise I'll wait every March of a year!
soda
Soda 🥸🤌
Hmm as someone who works at dillons i think i might have to try this.
What about dollar tree's 3 litter's
I always call it soda
Selfish content: ACTIVATE
15:30 I’ve always called it ‘fizzy drink’, which I’m pretty sure is a British-specific term. You Americans can keep calling us Brits posh while we call soda ‘fizzy drink’
Here in Eastern Canada we call it Soft Drink. So option D
They are totally influencing each other’s opinions by drinking and reviewing both at the same time lol but I am still happy with this new channel for sure
B
Dude knew what one came from the tap lol
Team C...aka, every carbonated drink is a coke.
Bottles are always best i find then can then fountain fountain is nasty tbh
"sodas only containing cola." No dr pepper, or flavors?     IM OUT.  YOUR CONDITIONS ARE BULLSHIT.  Your prejudice is rediculous!  DR PEPPER 4 LYFE.  😛
Who else popped open a fresh Diet Coke to drink along while watching?
i'm soda
I hope I wasnt the only one who thought the San Andreas theme was gonna play at 1:05
The classic "I'm an unknown newbie who ends up winning the tournament" trope
I admit, I was tickled to hear Food Lion and Harris Teeter made the list. :)  I'm from North Carolina and grew up calling soda Coke but, my husband is from MA and he grew up calling it soda.  He's rubbed off on me and now I call it soda too lol
I just use all of em   sometimes I call it poop
as a long island representative, we call it soda
*gasp* I never thought this day would come
I can confirm Big K diet cola from King Soopers is as good/better than diet coke and has citric acid/a slight citrus flavor. If you're looking for store brand sodas, Big K sodas are really good.
Nooooooo
I call it "American sugar water"
Tab, bring Tab back
Never thought I would see the day
I'm C:coke
I find this hilarious because hes finding the best diet soda when im trying to quit my soda addiction.
I had to stop drinking diet sodas because aspartame and splenda both irritate my bladder so much that I have to pee every 15 minutes for a couple hours and there's a lingering effect if I drink them regularly that takes a while to completely clear out of my system. I think I'm more sensitive than most but this makes me want to suggest folks steer clear of these sweeteners, at least in the quantities that sodas use them to be so sweet. I put splenda in coffee with no noticeable problems, probably just because it's much less than what they put in sodas.
*impossible* - Thanos
This title is illegal
NOOO MAT NOOO
well, in the UK we call it fizzy drinks
Mat: The North Carolina based supermarket “Food Lion” which you’ve probably never heard of  Me, a North Carolinian: :(
I say Soda
Coke life uses cane sugar, so it’s worth the 15 calories. The high fructose corn syrup in regular coke is terrible for you. Diet is also worse for you btw.
Shaftsa, it kinda sucks!- A very funny editor
Nothing will EVER be better than a strong ginger beer!!!
four green lines.... huh 4:06
A
Somebody hacked his account. Impressive deep fake though
I say Soda, but I lived in the north till I was 11, then I moved south. Took me a while to understand what people meant when they ask about soda.
In UK we usually just say “fizzy drinks”
18:58 was the moment I realized yep they are certainly soulmates LMAO
the title: Wow it’s a ONCE IN A LIFETIME SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE HATES DIET COKE    Also him: Let’s just see how much I can drink at once 👁👁
Everyone: i can't believe Mat quit diet coke aaaaaaaaa Me: *patiently waiting for the theory that Mat might make*
D I am D I don't like fizz. Or coke or soda or pop
I will try Ruler Foods cola sometime.
Who are you and what have you done with matpat
Zero is definitely better than diet. But it’s also worse than normal. I’m talking about coke. And taste and not health.
pepsi be like ayoo
Obviously B. Also North Carolina does have a history of good soda. We got cheerwine, and Pepsi started here
This has "Gangplank has died" vibes to me. Impactful, but ultimately, just a minor setback in a greater character journey. Runeterra needs a theory, MatPat.
Me who is obsessed with Dr. Pepper.
I've never liked diet soda for the most part. they just bubble up way to much in your mouth and the fact that it just tastes so artificial. And to be honest I don't believe that it's even much better than normal soda, feel free to prove me wrong.
*Top 10 anime betrayals*
MatPat: “Coke please sponsor me!?” Also MatPat now: *quits drinking coke* Coke soon: “So hey, wanna do a sponsor?”
To me It’s soda-pop, mostly because my grandparents are from either the Deep South or the mid mid west.
Everyone in canada calls it pop
That’s impossible, It can’t be, NO WAY! NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mountain Dew is the true nectar of the gods  All other sodas are garbage
I’m a coke talking person in New Mexico they ask the same thing “what coke do ya want”
B
Our grocery store's brands are usually better than name brand.  But that 10-20% that isn't better is just terrible.
"...FoodLion, a chain you've probably never heard of..."  My father who lost his job to FoodLion:
pain.
Well Matt, well Cheerwine might not technically be a cola. If you’re living in North Carolina it deserves a special seed in this bracket. Especially considering you love the fruit in the Harris Teeter....
B. its always been soda for me. ive heard people call it "pop" and "coke" but i dont call it that.
There's a lot of weird cuts and edits in this episode
In my opinion on the Soda or Pop thing, i think if you get it from a fountain it’s soda but if it’s from a bottle or can it’s pop. What’s your opinion?
Anyone else seeing some weird artifacting in this video? Also soda
Coke Diet Its a WHOLE diffrent thing trust me :)
Boylan is so good, but their Diet, really is the worst. It's hard to do a sugar cane soda with 0 calories
did anyone else see a weird flash at 13:30
anyone else notice how at about 13:29 there was a 'connection glitch,' where bars of color would flicker for a 1 frame on your screen then disappear?
I HAD A MIND BLOW RIGHT NOW!!!!
This is not matpat. This is a doppelganger
nah click bate
I live in Canada and we call it pop... unless your weird. Lol
whaaat the title nooooooooooo
Here its "Cola"
I would have included Mexican Diet Coke (Coca Cola Light), is by far my favorite zero calories drink in the world and I prefer it over Diet Coke.
Pop!
Future Arg video... Calling it now
We also know him for the fact that he didn't ever masturbate. Good cristian boy. :,D
Who else just swaps from soda and pop
GG Pepsi 🥤🥤
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MATPAT!?!?
Have you considered diet ginger ale?
Plot twist: Steph forced MatPat to make this video after she discovered he was cheating on her with it
Plot twist: DAD told Matpat to stop and eat more FOOD
Answering the poll of how you call soda, here in Mexico is called "Refresco", in the case of "Diet soda" is "Refresco de dieta", and in some regions (like mine) the sodas are referred as "Chescos"
As a born and raised Minnesotan, it is pop 100%
Matpat-I quit diet coke Me-*impossible*
None. I repeat. None of those grocery stores exist in Hawaii
When you like the fruity flavour, try Mezzo Mix, SchwipSchwap or one of the other versions (these are from Coca Cola and Pepsi) that are a mixture between Cola and Fanta (or what ever other companies call them). It is something as far as I know limited to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but here you won't find a restaurant etc that doesn't have either Mezzo Mix etc as bottle, can etc or simply Spezi (short for Spezial [special], originating from the German brewery Paulaner) on the menu. It is honestly something that I miss when I'm on vacation. I think, I also never saw Mezzo Mix in Italian Switzerland, so it may be just a good drink known by practically all Germans that other cultures just don't know about
This is the real March Madness.
You need to do a giveaway with 30 of these sodas 🥤
WHAT ABOUT
Coke zero is better than any other drink on the bord  Steph is right
If I’m being honest yes Krogers colas are the same i conducted a mini test and it’s true
This isn't a food theory this is a food STATEMENT
whats with the green stripes at 4:06
Here in Scotland a lot of people call it all Irn Bru (similar to how people in the South call it all Coke). But I grew up saying "Soft Drink" for it all, courtesy of the Pacific Northwest.
Surprising
I know you can’t say the real reason why you quit Diet Coke, but I’m still proud of you Mat Pat.
I knew Food Lion was NC specific, I did not know Harris Teeter was.
Am coke
I didn’t know Harris teeter was from nc. No wonder I remember them coming to schools and giving those old dinosaur mascot erasers. It’s also crazy to hear someone say you’ve probably never heard of food lion since there just such a norm here.
We don’t drink soft drinks where I’m from. We only drink Sweet Iced Tea or Lemonade.
Hey, not sure if it’s near you, but FIZ is my favorite soda. I didn’t really like their diet cola, but maybe you might!
WOW, so this is not clickbait?
I'm from South Texas, and we usually say Coke.
That’s crazy, throughout the whole video I was thinking to myself how Kroger’s Big-K cola was my favorite cola of all time.
B even tho I live in mighigan
impossible
Havent watched yet but this already isnt beleiveable cmon has to be clickbait matpat loves his diet coke too much
Coke.      wait you mean what you call soda
I agree, Kroger definitely brings their A games with pop and other groceries
This is the only reason I drink diet coke
I live in Scotland and I just call it juice
This was just an excuse for matpat to have more soda
MatPat: quits Diet Coke the Coca Cola company: "I feel a great disturbance in the force"
Buy ragin grape from food lion
21:06 Blursteph half between the seconds.
This is incredible. We love to see it.
This is just MatPat getting back at them for never sponsoring him.
Dang, you're making me want to move to North Carolina for the soda
glictches in the video?
nooo..man noooooooo NOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm a soda pop
18:42 when Mat and Steph disagree on what’s going to be for dinner.
he forgot pepsi max
Harris Teeter stocks RN ^
1:11  His old edits look weird now
No shame on Steph for separating Florida from the rest of the US.  Most people wish they could.  Also I'm a soda man.
OMG EARLY
Thank you, now I have the courage to tell you Diet Coke is horrible
Anyone else want to see him and steph tackle all the various flavors of Fanta to see which one reigns supreme? My favourite is probably orange.
X
i just witnessed history
If you slow down pause the video around 13:31 there is something that shows up for a fraction of a second
as a German, I think the only thing I call those are soft drinks, jupp the english words I don't even know a german umbrella term...
Loved this Harris Teeter underdog story
I’m a soda pop man
Me looking at the title and thumbnail: Impossible.
I’m glad you did quit Diet Coke. Diet drinks are horrible for you. The aspartame in them just blah 🤮 haha your honestly better off just drinking normal soda... it’s healthier. Actually had a diabetic roommate that I’m convinced was addicted to aspartame because he would literally get sick if he didn’t have diet soda.
Soda, but I'm a Norwegian
Great minds think alike.
I’m pop
I’ve heard of food lion but I didn’t know Harris teeter was North Carolina based
☹️
wait food lion and Harris teeter are NC based what!?
19:05 Soulmate energy
I looked my notifications and when this popped up in my notifications a other video in my recommendeds called “what’s?” Popped up now am confused.
Yayyy cancer soda
i grow up with pop
Looks like you're rehabilitating yourself from your Diet Coke addiction.
I’m pop
No one has ever heard of food lion.  Mr.Beast: Am I a joke to you.
Btw Mat, I am from India and when Diet Sasta cola came, i was like, what the heck man,  because "sasta"  in India means Cheap and that actually read cheap diet cola ... 🤣🤣🤣
If you want a cola, don’t do diet. It has more chemicals and artificial flavors/sweeteners, it’s not really Coca-Cola or Pepsi anymore. I drink Mexican Coke, which has real sugar cane, other then diets and zeros, so I recommend that if anyone wants the “better”. But it doesn’t mean that coke is horrible for you and you shouldn’t drink it with every meal.
I'll let you know the results if I can get my hands on one with my parents.
Food lion is more widespread than just north Caroline. Northern most region in MD.
try bepsi
Im D:
B: Soda
No wayyyyy!
I have a theory why the Boylan soda was so medicinal. Original colas were supposed to be cough medicine, and if Boylan hasn't changed their recipe much like you claim, it makes sense that it tastes like medicine.
prediction "dr pepper"
Grew up calling everything coke but switched to soda when I moved.  As for the store brand thing, kroger's (or fry's depending on where you live) K brand soda has the only Dr pepper that I have found that tastes like the original
King of Skill would be proud of that paper, rock, scissors segment. That was the epitome of " DO IT AGAIN !"
I stand by Stephanie’s choice!
the day has come.. may diet coke forever rest, lost in the back of the fridge
Unhealthy madness or matpat madness
its like quitting breathing for matpat
Food theory: Best way to recover from coffee addiction. (Coffee is my diet coke.)
We Tennesseans call it soda. And i live near a food lion.
Look no further, MatPat. The best soda is Sprite. Always has been.
I didn’t know this was legal.
Grew up asking for soda
This is the one game/film/food theory I hit the dislike button matpat and Diet Coke is inseparable periodddd.
Did the fountain come from McDonald's or somewhere else?
what the heck is 13:53
9:37 hahahahahah Alien face activated.
So happy steph is on food theory. It honestly wouldn't be the same if she wasn't here
I’m B
As a wise man once said but hey that's just a theory a food theory
IMA "POP"ed boy
Let's be honest here people, this video is one of if not the main reason Food Theory was created
Taste test have to number in the lasting factor. As in, "Could you consume a copious amount of said substance, without getting tired of it", because for example one sip of pepsi is proven to be more of a people's choice than coke, but pepsi is way too sweet to drink too much of.
Always wondered whats stronger: Mats love to his wife Steph, or his love to diet coke. Guess thats settled now. I doubt he could ever be without her for a year, like he did with diet coke ;) <3  Love your videos Mat!
well there is a food4less that my family does go to at times and i haven't really ever tried the generic diet pop
OH MY GOD I can’t believe it
Northwest is pop, but now I live in AZ where it's soda and so I feel weird calling it pop even to my husband...
Here in Alabama it's all coke.
What does matpat mean like hat is it short for
Can we get some comments that are not about Shock and are actually talking about their choice
Don't be sad cause it ended, be happy cause you can complete this quote
I grew up calling pop, pop
Drink kombucha, it's healthy and it tastes like a soda
pop
Huh he lost weight, good job 🙂
Welll you messed up when you didn’t use the Diet Coke mini bottles. Clearly the best version of Diet Coke.
Im from reading.... I didnt know reading wasnt involved in March madness
Biggest clickbait of the century
Was there an ARG i missed? what are those flashes of green static
Nothing scares me but that title It terrifies me
Pepsi
all theorists to diet coke: So long partner
mat pat quit the one thing he loves above all else
18:42 yup, they are soulmates
i can't wait to see a different cola in all the other theory episodes
as someone from the mid-west it is Pop
Me:reads the title   Me: “crying no” meme
Grew up POP ..but I call it Soda
Soda
I love how when they finally do paper, they both do it at the same time. Precious. You can tell they're made for each other. 😂
WAIT? PEOPLE HAVENT HEARD OF FOOD LION? I mean sure I don’t specifically remember seeing it other places but really?
Matpat:'were doing a strictly scientific way!' a few minutes later...'  rock paper scissors!'
I’m literally shaking and crying right now
This is a stupid episode, but I'm enjoying it a lot, especially after a _very creepy_ different youtube video which I shall not name, so that you do not have to be creeped out like I was.
Matpat preferring Harris Teeter over Diet Coke is probably the biggest plot twist of this millennia
I say soda 🥤
What Kind of animal Drinks Diet? WTF you either have Diabetes or you are a Straight Up Sociopath.
I am a D, grew up calling them fizzy drinks but now I call them soda
You know, this is wierd, my family shops at ralphs a lot, and honestly, at some point, I do want to test this.
I love dandelion and burdock but the coop store brand I think is disgusting  fentamens all the way
coke zero> diet coke
Matpat should try Coca cola zero.
17:15 my wife can taste citrus acid in drinks and it always puts her off. Doesn't bother me though.
Time to get that aspartame sponsor my friend.
Dr pepper isnt cola?
What... In the heck... Did I just watch?  What are these *lies?* What are these *deceptions?* MATPAT. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO JUST *CHANGE* LIKE THAT, BUDDY.
This video is sponcerd by doctor pepper.
A) Pop. I'm from canada
We'll never know what he said in the end
D. Fizzy
Soda!
Store brand items/drinks are made in big brand company's with a tweak to the recipe. So some of your favorite diet soda/pop might of been made in a coke  or a Pepsi factory. Working at publix years ago I was told in meetings that the store brand are made in the same factory's but tweak the recipe.
Well that was an upset, I’ll have to give the Harris Teeter soda a try, good thing it’s a 10 minute walk/1 minute drive for me
Ayo I want the red jacket
I saw the title and was like Am I happy? Should I be happy? Am I confused? Should I be confused? Help Huh This seems important Well imma watch it Have they run out of ideas now  Gosh that blew up Mom  im famous lol thanks tho
F
They should try world yum's box
First
Pepsi Max. I drink it but not as much as I drink water, coffee and tea, tho occasionally I dabble in Mother of Energy and Monster Energy drinks.
There's something unsettling about "MatPat's tastebuds" being accompanied by that wiggling tongue.
Unless it's root beer all soda is garbage.
Plot twist: The editors switched Harris teeter and Diet Coke did to make MatPat look bad
Will steph still be in food theory
Why is every so concerned about having a "healthy soda". All of them are going to have an outrageous amount sugar or "insert any artificial sweetener here" as well as being carbonated.  If you really want to be healthy then just drink water, have a diverse enough diet to get all the nutrients you need, and listen to your doctor.  I'm not saying you can't enjoy and occasional treat in moderation but that shouldn't be the only source of water in your diet.
nooooo
Mat and Steph keep getting ties in Rock Paper Scissors brings immense amounts of joy to my soul
Other: Lemonade
plot twist: there is no plot twist
Are you ok mat?
I am a “pop” guy
WATER
IMPOSSIBLE- I SAY
Impossible....
I am saying this before I see the video and am thinking MATPATT STOPS DRINKING DIET COKE IMPOSSIBLE     Edit:I finished and just WOW
I would've had a 3rd judge to beat out the odds of each 1v1 diet soda challenge. That way it's truly unbias and would not have ended in a 3 way final round. Or, perhaps hold off the final round so your tastes can take that time to reset the amount of types of soda you guys had in that day.
This is the anime character development I live for!
I’m in the northern/southern because in Maryland was a more southern state in the civil war but is still high in the states but every one I know (especially the people in Texas)
Some of my family calls it "Fizzy Drink" but I call it "soda".  we are all from the south.
Soda fountain diet coke is nasty as all get out.
I am other: We call soda "the devil's sugar liquid" in this room.  It's fabulous stuff
B
im disappointed in you matpat
ZEVIA! It takes time to get used to the taste but it got me off soda! Also hello from a fellow North Carolinian!
Why do so many popular youtubers live in north carolina? It's kind of weird
Clearly you haven't heard of HEB
Try water mat pat ive never drank water my entire life you can do it for the rest of yours
In England we call a lot of ‘soda’ simply fizz/fizzy. But when it comes to coke, or pepsi or Doctor pepper, at least round here we just say coke. But if it has bubbles it’s a “fizzy drink”
The day of reckoning is upon us.
I call it soda
Honestly...Walgreens Cherry Coke tastes better than regular Coke Cherry 😂
Bang Miami cola: 0 cals and is an energy drink.
D. In UK (Or at least Ceredigion) we say their names specifically if we aren't being general. To which we say soft/fizzy/alcoholic drinks
either the world is ending or we are in a different universe
I never heard of thoses colas, i'm sure that's because France is one of the worst country to make something different or even be different. 😑
I say the name of whatever it is so like "lemonade" or "Pepsi".
Soda, I'm from the south west
Where I'm from (Ontario, Canada) we don't call it Pop or Soda, or even Coke...just a "Soft Drink".
this is impossible
Mystery that needs to be solved:  Is coke zero and pepsi zero the same?
All of us when we saw the title we all got scared
You should have tasted Faygo. Let me just say as a Homestuck fan, Faygo is chef kiss*
Fry's? As in the electronics store?
WHAT FIRST STEPH LEAVING AND NOW THIS  *THIS IS T00 MUCH TO HANDLE RN* 😭
No not Diet Coke
😲
Coca-cola zero my boy second place I'm proud
Pop. I am Pop
Crustal Poopsy Sales Sales Profits Sales
Today on Food Theory the most un healthy episode.
8:12 i was watching in full screen and your camera flickered, genuinely thought laptop was broken
IF you want some carbonated drink, sparkling water is so much more healthier and tastes better as well
Mat is right im dating a girl from Florida while im from Michigan the soda or coke v. Pop conversation has happened many times
I have a Kroger literally a block away from me, and I love their pops so much.
From that north eastern part of Ohio just like MatPat, grew up with pop!
Ay fred meyers pog
Why not the Zero version of stuff? It legitimately tastes different.
i feel like one of the problems is that they chose fountain which, in my opinion, gets worse as time goes on more than others do
Ima pop guy
What if citric acid is the krabby patty secret ingredient XD
It's called a "Fizzy-drink" well at least here in the land of the tea. (The UK)
Never have I been so invested in off-brand soda as I have been through this video.
Who are you and what did you do to matpat
This is diet Coke’s fault for not sponsoring matpat
You fool I REPLASED ALL YOUR COKE WOTH DR. PEPER!!! *evil laugh*
Someone must have kidnap matpat and replaced him with a doppelganger that malfunctioned and didnt like diet coke anymore
Sadge
Pop lol
I'm a coke guy.
But thats just a theory a food theory
Midwest pop shall rule supreme, I don't make the rules
I'm just happy that my boy Coke Zero got to finals
Try BARR cola. Fun fact , diet pepsi whist it exists in the UK is just nowhere near as common as pepsi sugar free ( known as pepsi max in the uk).  In the UK its pop , or just  "soft drink"  Its all moot anyway , everyone knows Dandelion and burdock is the god of soft drinks or Iorn Bru
Background music on point
Blasphemy
More and more, i feel like you don't have an actual theory to these episodes. Still entertaining, but let's face it. You just wanted to try all the soda brands.
drink water soda bad
Guess coke in America is different              Im from UK
Try Kvass
If this isn't click bait, I'm unsubscribing
Me in Florida and being younger than Mat: I grew up with Food Lion stores
I hope that once the pandemic is under control, you'll be able to road trip across the US and try other store brand Diet Cola's. I'm not a big Cola fan but I know H-E-B's Dr. Pepper dupe is really good
When you dont have any of those stores:😭
Took ya long enough Mat
I actually used soda more as a child.  It's what we called it in Southeast Asia at least, in countries that do speak English a bit.
soda forever
Looking in the comments to see someone who cares     JK
Why would you call other SODA companies coke?
Wait food lion is regional? Huh thought it was in more places. (I’m from and live in South Carolina)
I honestly agree with stephanie for the #1 Coke
when you think about it, maybe citric acid is actually the secret crabby patty ingredient. like, has someone tried this?
Boylan is amazing... idk about the diet but definitely the best root beer
Impossible
A: pop
Ok so I love this diet cola called Skipper’s and they are so good it is a cola but it taste like Caramel and it is soooooooooooooooooooo good
Uh normal coke?
Until my parents started letting me drink soda, I just called it spicy juice
Soda pop,pop,soda I was all these
Plot Twist: 2020 was bad because Matt Didn't drink diet coke
I have never watched your FNAF or sans video, am i missing something?  but I did know about your diet coke habits (True fan !!) . 😂😂
Soda pop
No more diet Coke jokes 😦
WAH
Actualy fir me its d, we call softdriks “frisdrank”
who is matpat where is matpat WHY IS MATPAT
Saw the title and called BS

The first thing I thought when I got the notification was, LIES.
Before I even watch this video.   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Me Theory: "I WAS RIGHT!!!!!!"  Well sort of, I said 2050 I think. When Matpat would give up Diet Coke.
Diet Sam's Cola is actually pretty good.
am from uk, personally i say pop and so does my dads side but my mums half of the family call it all lemonade (much as steph said about coke but with a different name)
C: Coke
Lol 14:52 Pepsi is from nc too!
New hashtag #HarrisTeeterSponsorMatpat
15:25 I will admit when i offer a drink or ask I often just say can I get you a coke or something instead but I use pop unless its creme soda
This is a nightmare, but in a video form
I grew up with mostly “soda” and a bit “pop”.  I don’t really like either of those words but they’re of course better than “coke” as a generic term.
I’ll keep to my Mountain Dew
Harris teeter soda = my favorite sodas to spend 50 cents on a 2 liter on
Ight ima go to Harris teeter

Wow. Last time I was this early, Mat was talking about Sonic's speed on Game Theory
Water Matt. Please drink water
I hate it when people say, in the south we call it coke, I have lived in Texas my whole life and I just call it soda, and I have never met someone who calls it coke.
Uhh I saw the title and I can’t believe it
Clickbait title option: MatPat does excessive amounts of Coke through a straw.
I can vouch for the regular Boylan, the Creme and Root Beer are very good! I've never tried the diet before but sounds like I should stay away
Did anyone else see that weird glitch at 4:05?
This must be Matt’s midlife crisis video
where I live pop is common when I lived in Arizona and asked for a pop when I was at Mcdonalds they just stared at me dumbfounded at what I was asking for
me:who lives in north Carolina  =)
It will never be the same
BA (Sodapop)
THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END MY GOD.

15:30, I say soda, but easily understand if someone says pop or coke what they mean.

Stephanie, does he have a fever?
15:32 Coke and Soda are what we use in South Africa
Me, who has grown up in rural SW VA: Yeah Mat, I've heard of all these stores. I'm a soda or coke person, depends on how thick their accent is.
Coke zero is the best
Kool-aid zero sugar should replace diet coke
To answer the question at 15:32, I say "softdrinks" so D
Im from south Georgia so ima c
Raised in Texas, I grew up with it as Coke. And I have a Kroger down the street and I'm really curious
i just have to say it, why dose he look so old in the thumb nail ?
My grandmother called it “tonic”.

To see MatPat doing this vid makes me laugh!
The story of the harris teeter was an anime story all along
Alternate title: I dumped diet coke for a cuter soda
Thank you Kroger. Your service is appreciated.
Pops and soda interchangeably, depends who I am talking to, how many I am talking about and how easy it rolls off the tougne. OHIO THE HEART AND CROSS ROADS OF THE NATION, which means we talk funny to everyone
Food Lion is my second closest grocery store. Piggly Wiggly is the other.
The Rock, Paper, Scissors battle was the most epic thing I've seen come out of any of Mat's channels
When do your editors sleep? Do they sleep? How can they preduce so much highly edited content in such a ahort time? Do you pay them enough?
POP
Honestly so glad Harris teeter is getting recognized loved their soda and always buy groceries there keep up the good stuff
OBJECTION! While Coca-Cola may be the oldest soda in this bracket, it is _not_ the original cola. Coca-Cola was invented in 1886, but Moxie was invented in 1885 and is on the national market to this day... thanks to being bought out by the Coca-Cola company. But it still came first!
Couple So-D-Pops
Cheating from the beginning, as fountain drinks are never the same from one location to another and are specifically set to inject more syrup than you'd get in a bottle or can.
Impossible. ๏_๏
Mathew: this is very scientific. Also mat and steph: rock, rock, rock rock rock rock
We always call it soda, but we make fun of those weird people by calling it sodie pap
I never understood his love fo diet coke, it tastes so much worse than normal coke to me
Citric acid is why lemon and lime taste good in Diet Coke.
What a wonderful episode 👏 It really tells us something about life
You forgot Pepsi Max
LET'S GO NORTH CAROLINA
YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME MAT YOU HAVE BETRAYED THE COLA GODS OF DIET COKE

Soda.
I just call em all sodies
How
I call it fizzy.
Spoiler:  Harris Teeter finishes this off by singing Kelly Carkson's "A Moment Like This."
o no the stock of these are just gonna raise
The answer for me is all. I've said all those names for it. I say coke usually tho....I also usually drink coca-cola
fun fact Del haze Americas(Food lions parent company) is Diet Pepsi. As Pepsi franchises their production and sells the extra to store chains at a discount. most store brands are extra bought from name brands with exceptions for things like whole foods. the most common name brands to sell their extras are RC cola and Pepsi. I learned this working at Hannaford(another del haze chain) while talking to some of our distributors and  drivers.
I call it soda and sometimes as coke
This is the 3rd most american video on food theory
Am I the only one who drank all of these soda at least once?
Cola Zevia is my favorite :D
matpat: I quit diet co- me: THE F*CK YOU SAY TO ME
Well he isn't getting that Diet Coke sponsor now.
I never thought this day would come...
Glass coke is the best
Stevia is only good in very small quantities or herbal teas. If you need something sweeter find a good erythritol and stevia blend.
I say soda
When you tie against an opponent six times in rock paper scissors, that means that you have an amazing connection.
Matpat. Diet coke is best coke
Everybody gangsta until Matpat quits Diet Coke.
i have less respect for matt patt YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
Other, in Australia I grew up calling all soft drink flavours and brands fizzy and still do, but in a lot of our big brand grocery stores it's commonly labelled as mixers
soda
This title has to be clickbait, it is too bad to be true
My go to soda is the Dr pepper from MC Donalds
this is 100% click bait
Don’t quit man
Just finished watching.
man, he quits the diet coke! thats... the end of an era
I love crack but sadly there I can't make a video like this... legally
Fore some one who whats to know I sa some green lines 4:05
I just realized you live in my state0-0 oof nice
you should do this for other sodas too like orange soda
Sprite or 7 up
I live in South Africa and in my area we call it cool drink
Try foreign sodas. I nominate cola Couronne and limonade from Haiti. (Warning: Couronne kinda tastes like a very sweet medicine but it's delicious and part of my childhood)
Fountain shouldn't even be a choice option.  Every single fountain uses a different concentration of syrup to water depending on how cheep the restaurant is. Both Mc Donnalds and that mom and pop short-order place down the street both use soda fountains but you know mom and pop's place puts a better amount of syrup in and makes a taster coke then the big chain stores and their cheep tactics and their extra ice. Can out of the can is better then bottle out of the bottle, but bottle to glass can be better then can to glass if you pour it right. See even pouring the coke makes a difference. And on top of all that, what state or country your coke was bottled or canned in or syrup produced makes a difference. Glass Bottle Cokes from Mexico are the best tasting versions of coke out there. And i'm sorry to be one of those guys who stops at 5:34 to make a big rant without watching anything else before commenting but as someone who also drinks a lot of coke, just not diet, i think your Coke choosing bracket is flawed.
Straws inhibit taste. The whole episode is inconclusive unless Matt always drinks from straws
B
This episode reminds me of literally any protaganist story, Think about it, A cola diet soda that was randomly picked from a grocery store with NO research mind you, and it was going against all the top challenegers, and even beat the top fighter, Mat Pat’s favorite diet coke. Kinda weird isn’t it?
Umm all of the above, I say all of those
UK is POP
i clicked on the notification so fast
I’m choked
I only do coke
Holyshit, North Carolina? Wooooooo, #CarolinasFTW
PA is soda

Citric Acid is the Fnaf of this channel

"Try generic". Sure. Anything but 'Great Value'.
Pepsi Zero Sugar is called Pepsi Max in the UK
kroger is the hidden villain in food theory!
The biggest anime betrayal ever
I don't even know who you are anymore MatPat.
Coke
I've always called it soda, whilst everyone else called it coke. I just don't feel like labeling the universal soda as coke, which is a type of soda.
b
Me: * sees video name * Me: WHATNOTHISISILLIGAL-

You what? Is that an app?

Clearly there's an imposter. Mat has given up on diet coke
WHOOHOO! MY HOME STATE NORTH CAROLINA! GO NC!

DR.pepper IS COLA

B: Soda you maniacs.
I can't believe Diet Cola LOST TO HARRIS TEETER!!!!!
Glad I work at Kroger, and I can confirm that their store-brand items are gourmet
?????? Goodbye the king of the diets
13:31 The Matrix cutting out to prevent us from learning the true secrets of Diet Soda
U will be missed slightly healtier coke
I call it soda, and I also grew up in the south - Georgia even :/
D: I call drinks by their names cuz I don't wanna be confused. This comes from someone who is born and currently still being raised in Atlanta, GA.
LETS GO NORTH CAROLINIANS 🎉🎉🎉
Maybe citric acid tastes so good to us because we can't make vitamin C it ourselves and our body is made to like the taste of citric acid to make us eat fruits with lots of vitamin C. But that's also just a theory
Me drinking carbonated water.
In the uk we call them "fizzy drinks" no joke
What happened to the "is taste really subjective?" video idea that was teased at the beginning of this channels life?
My friend who lives 10 minutes away is a diehard pop sayer but I definitely prefer soda tbh. I very much live in the midwest, up in minnesota, so I'm not sure how it happened but it's definitely soda for me, probably makes a bit of sense as well since I think soda would be likely more widely understood than pop.
Sees I quit Diet Coke!:  Who are you and what have you done with MATPAT!!
8:09 / 8:10 MORE green libes
But why tho ?
I am a coke zero person
Man I think matpat got COVID and lost his taste he isn’t going to drink Diet Coke NANI
But that's IMPOSSIBLE-THANOS
Grew up with soda and pop and cola. I've always said soda. However, I prefer Pepsi... just saying.
HOW COULD YOU
Rip diet coke
I am both pop (I was born and raised in the Midwest) and soda (lived in NC for a few years) person. I use them both without thinking.
I get a cola ad lol
Where can I get that red jacket, it looks amzing
MATPAT HOW COULD YOU? IVE BEEN HOPING THE SPONSORSHIP JOKE WOULD BECOME A REALITY
I always thought that Matt quitting coke is impossible as him stop making FNAF vids
Lies
I love when Matt doesn't like something but only because he laughs so sinisterly
Wait, that’s illegal.
I can confirm Florida is not part of the south east, it’s a different breed
MrBeast and Matt Patt should do a collab because they both live in North Carolina
My gf strongly recommend mountain dew
470 comments? where are y'all? hellooooo???
You are the first person I've ever known who thought fountain drinks tasted better than canned
Matpact- I quit diet coke Fans- inpossible  OoO  Everyone: keep diet coke Edit: the 62 dislikes are the fans that did not want Matpact to quit diet coke
I’m born and raised in the south and we say pop.
SOFT DRINK
MatPat: *Quits Diet Coke* Everyone: *Surprised Pikachu Face*
This has to be clickbait. He hasn’t even gotten a sponsorship from them yet
It’s pop here in indiana or as I have been know to say from time to time - soda-pop  And since when is root beer a substitute for Dr.pepper?
So weird to hear the super markets I’ve been growing up on here in North Carolina, forgot FT’s down here
I reload then just so many likes...
you should cover Lucky the leprechaun, who can fly(Shooting star charm), float(Red balloon charm), power to speed things up(Horseshoe charm), bring life to inanimate objects(Heart charm), teleport(Rainbow charm), have increased luck(Green clover charm), and change the colors of things(Unicorn charm). Is this stronger than Thanos?
Can't wait for the what else has citric acid food theory
*MatPat: Quits Diet Coke*  Coca Cola Profits: 📉
I think letting fountain coke into the bracket was a bit unfair, since that's not what he is likely to be drinking at home, but that's just me
Actually, I'm an iced tea guy.
DO YOU SEE THE SECRET LOOK
The soda to replace it is called water bro
Kroger is known for their amazing store brand knockoffs
Is this an april fools joke? But really really early?
“You’ve probably never heard of Food Lion”  *me living down the road from one for 10+ years*  nope, never heard of that one, MatPat 😂
In Australia Pepsi No Sugar is known as Pepsi Max
Is it April Fool's Day, already???
D) Sparkly sweet juice
Nothing can beat the nectar of the gods, DIET COKEEEE
Somewhere in the Coca Cola Headquarters:  - Our sales collapsed! - We are doomed!
TL;DR Pepsi wins !
You need to try Speed Cola. Lol.
Im An Agent Of Chaos. Mine Was Poda Sop

HOW ISN'T THIS VIDEO SPONSOERD!!!!!!
Lord this is definitely a sign
Me who lives in Maryland -  Wait, I know Food Lion and Harris Teeter!  Also, I am a soda person.
Reality is often disappointing.
8:09 cam glitched out 13:31
I read the title I was like 😳
Soda pop obviously
When i was younger i mixed coke w a bit of lemonade and it was amazing tbh
you know you're in sync with your spouse when you always tie at rock paper scissors
Surprised they didn't put RC cola as a contender, that would've been interesting to see
sponsored video
Never even liked soda. The carbonation is unbearable...
Me: *seeing the title and thumbnail* Me: laughable, let me see
Coke is not good.
Pop
I don't believe you..
Anyone else notice the random glitches throughout the video or is COVID starting to finally get to me
Guys I found an easter egg that it was like a picture but I don't know what does it mean
13:31 weird flash
Wait what.........we lost the patient in surgery
WHYWHWYWNYWHWYWHWYWYWYWHY
MatPat: I gave up Diet Coke in 2020 Also MatPat in the beat the heat episode: Diet Coke helps spice a lot
Around where I live most people call it pop, but some people call it soda
Diet Coke man is now the not Diet Coke man more like the Harris teeter man
Can’t you change between flavors each time to get a different taste each time.
The video has been corrupted!
you have a very nice house
14:36 me, a west virginian who has a food lion store like 2 minutes away from my house: ...
Everyone in the coments is in disbelief, but I'm just facinated. I never knew some of this stuff about soda. And I always thought I was the only one who could taste what container soda came from.
D. Other. I called it fizzy juice
We have the same name 😎
Anyone else been noticing the glitches lately?  Like the color glitch today?  Something's telling me we've got another arg coming up.
When your early enough that the bots haven't replied to every single comment yet.
wait you're telling me that harris teeter isn't a national grocery store
he in the west its soda
MatPat: gives up diet coke  Everyone: imposible
I have yet to go to Harris teeter and find a product that they make that I dislike
*MatPat just discovered the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties is citric acid* 😂
Imagine if all colas were cough syrup then people like Matt Pat who are addicted to cola wouldn’t exist a world where Matt Pat Isn’t addicted to cola
Root beer is the best soada there is

Hi
You two should make a gmm style channel. Cuz this just reminds me of march milkness
Say it ain't so, Matpat.  SAY IT AIN'T SO!
Matt: #2 Steph: 😮😮😮😮
You could always stop drinking soda altogether. Crazy idea I know
Freeway cola is the way to go Matt I tell you
I call it coke
Give South Carolina some credit. We have Food Lion too.
Him quitting diet coke is like a meth addict of 20 years all of a sudden stopping it's not going to happend
Current title:  *I QUIT Diet Coke!*
MatPat looking for a new diet drink?  Either   1. He's been badly replaced by an alien counterpart.  2. Ennard became his innard.  3. Parenthood has finally gotten to his head.
I wonder what Matpat thinks of Cheerwine? It’s this soda they only sell in NC.
here in Canada we say pop
well i am Bulgarian so as other can i say  Газирано (Gazirano)?
That rock paper scissor situation really proves that Matt and steph are meant for each other.  Edit: I fixed it, my bad.
Pop (Minnesota for the win)
What did you call it? Kids from 1899 "we called it cocaine"
Where my fellow Pop's at
I’ve been a loyal theorist since I was 9 or 10 years old so please don’t hate me when I say this, I don’t like Diet Coke. It doesn’t taste good. Anyway love y’all <3
FINALLY HE QUIT DIET COKE
Did he say 13th seed harris teeter when on screen it said 10th in the finals?
I'm a B person, although I prefer classic Orange-Vanilla Coca-Cola to any others, as Zero gives me diarrhea faster and Diet tastes weird
Leninade is my favorite soda
We call it soft drinks here in the Philippines 😊
In Israel we call it Cola.
14:50 as someone who prefers pepsi to coke and can't stand diet coke (sorry matt) and knows how much you love diet coke I'm not surprised diet pepsi lost so early.
Food lion is in South Carolina too.
Out of this video the only thing I could focus on is the fact I have the same cups as mat lmao
"well here in the south it's all universally 'coke'"  I don't like when people say this because I've lived in Mississippi my entire life and all of us call it "soda", the only time we call it "coke" is if it's a coke product like Diet Coke or Coke Zero
people may ask: Hey why does matpat show his face on the thumbnails more often now??? Me: well because hes finally confident about his self image and his red leather jacket....BUT THATS JUST A THOERY!!!!!
Does anyone else find it adorable that they're sharing the same straws?
Oh my god.
Your joking?
Was it me i saw a green screen, 8:10 (ish)
He simultaneously wiped and nae-naed
9:58 You could get stevia to have at home, it works a lot better than sugar when it comes to making your tea sweet
I love your videos
Im thinking of buying citric acid at this point
E - Fizzy Drink
As a Midwesterner, in my family we call it soda... Mostly cos when I would tell my grandparents I wanted a pop I would get "popped" (smacked) on the arm because "You said you wanted pop you got popped. Or did you mean you want a soda?" ;-;
how IMPOSIBLE
I call bullcrap lol
coke addict moving to a new drug colorized 2021
Hey Mattpat can u do a video on snydercut?
im a pop person so A
Pepsi Rules 💙🔵🔴
I saw the title and immediately my brain went: 'STOP DOING EVERYTHING AND WATCH THIS VIDEO.'
I recently swapped from Diet Coke to Coke Zero, so I'd be very interested to try that Harris Teeter. And it looks like I'll be taking a trip to the local Krogers!  Oh and we call it Coke here.
I say soda exclusively
Maybe try Zero Two’s coom. It has zero calories with twice the flavor of regular cola
Before watching, I'm going to make a prediction: Mat got a letter, email or some other relay from coke and it's a cease and decent on talking about their product so much or somthing along those lines.  Just a guess. Comment if I'm accurate or inaccurate.
I am a... pop kind of girl
me and my sister gasped simutaously, placed a hand over our mouths and said "it can't be!"
I got a Food Lion near my house I walked there all the time
Noooo
try spindrift, i love it
I'm tenth like
They’ve got Food Lions in MARYLAND TOO!! And their cola is very good
North Carolina knows soda
Coke is all I say when ordering
What kind of coke is Matt quitting???
I can just hear a new food theory: we solved the krabby patty formula
2:38 OMG MATPAT FOOT REVEAL
b
Best diet soda is A&W diet cream soda
Im hungry
Pop man here
Personally, I think shasta grape is better than cola
And now I want to try the cane sugar variant of other sodas, I'm curious. Edit 1: I am soda, but I've heard Soda Pop a lot when I was little. Edit 2: I also maybe want to try some citrus in my soda.
Me: Sees the title  *This must be serious*
FOOD LION IS AMAZING I LIVE IN PA BUT MY GRANDPARENTS ARE IN NC AND I LOVE LOVE LOVE FOOD LION
Raise your hand if you waited for another food theory for a this whole week🙋
This Is the biggest event of the month
I actually don't like soda. My friends always give me a weird look
But but but... aspartame
soda
Soda = Anything that comes out of a fountain Coke = Anything that comes out of a can Pop = Anything that comes out of a glass bottle  Soda Fountain, Can of Coke, Bottle of Pop
I was surprised when they did the Publix brand. I wasn't sure if Publix had made it all the way up to North Carolina yet, and thought it might still be Kroger territory.
nahhh she's right "and florida..." because florida is well...... florida.
How am I both surprized and not surprized that a grocery store that's whole claim to fame is "community and friendly service" is only a Southern chain? Edit: FOOD LION REPRESENT! PLZ TAKE FLORIDA BACK WE MISS YOU
Cream soda
Am I the only one who notices the edited skin fade in the thumbnail 😂
9:39 nobody I have ever known likes Zevia. Edit: D, Fizz drink Edit2: Well then, I have only 1 hope for finding the holy soda. (also, you should check out 711's soda, its pretty good...)
the guy who named soda a "soft drink" haven't got a coke can thrown at their face
whats going on with 13:30
In Australia we call it soft drink don’t know why
Coca-Cola is trembling after seeing the title.
Water.
IMPOSSIBLE-Thanos
I wonder if it would be funnier if the title was “I quite Coke” and just have some people be like “He was on COCAINE?!”
I have a zevia issue straight up I drinknway to much ov it
Wasn't Dr pepper established in 1889 making it older out of all of them?
to quote my doctor "The healthiest soda for you to drink is none.  If you're going to justify drinking Diet, then go ahead but it's not any better."
In this house, we call it fizzy lifting drink.
Diet coke would be out in the first round for me
How about some Bubly
13:30 what is happening?
Me: Saw Title Also me: Oh ok, so Matt Patt is actually quiting diet whaaaaaaaaat!!!!😲
My favourite Cola is actually from Air Up, which I got introduced to thanks to SORTED food. It (ab)uses the fact most of your taste is smell/aroma and manages to flavour water with exactly that, meaning you are just drinking water and smelling Coke. Surprisingly enough the result (for me) is the taste of a less sweet coke, which is my absolute favourite flavour combo I found so far. Also 0 calories.
I worked at a restaurant that served boylan, I would usually drink ginger ale flavor or orange, I would always avoid cola cause it was terrible 😥 Edit: I would drink boylan very often because we could drink them for free, and because of the 100% cane sugar, I ended up with 6 cavities, an extraction and a root canal after a few months working there... be sure to drink it sparingly because if you drink it regularly, your teeth will practically rot out of your skull 🥲
Food Lion is a big deal here in Maryland!
I don't really get the whole diet thing
😦 😧 😨 😨 😱 😟:0
INCA COLA? HOW ABOUT THAT
Food Lion actually exists all the way over here on the other side of the globe, surprisingly. We don't call it the same here, but I'd recognize that logo anywhere.
Coke
MATPAT WHAT THE HECK
Now I wanna try that diet coke. I'm not a diet coke kinda person but this keeps me interested.
Hi
What makes diet coke unique among diet sodas is it was made to taste good, not to mimic regular coke. Rather than being a poor man's substitute of the original like most diet sodas or coke zero, it didn't try to taste the same. It's its own unique flavor that people like so much that allegedly New Coke from the 80s was just diet Coke with sugar.
*reads title* GOOD, ITS HORRIBLE FOR YOU 😂
Harris Teeter is the Butler of Diet Soda March Madness

as soon as i saw the title, i came to watch this. >:3
Mat are you okay? How much FOOD have you been eating? Are you being controlled? What about DAD? Will you ever talk about DAD on film theory again? Your relationship with DAD is confusing.
is he actually doing this
Hello americans is there any diference between diet coke and coke zero ? Taste wise
Mat quit coke...... y :(
Matt you good.   And is there any way I can work for you? I've been watching your channel since the first fnaf theory I would love to work for you guys. The team seem live a loving family.
Imma Soda
Best 24 minutes I could spend today.
What am I going to drink in 2021? Over half way through March.
I have a theory everyone:  If you look on all of MatPats channels, you see the icons of the channel all have a circle around it. In the circle, there are 4 little spaces around it. Each channel icon fills one of the circles in. (Like in the food theory icon, it’s filled in on the bottom left) Since there are 3 channels, they each fill in 3 different holes. But there is one more space that isn’t filled in, so basically, MatPat will release another channel with another space filled in. I rest my case.

I call it soda or coke just what I feel like

'pepsi zero sugar' YOU DONT CALL IT PEPSI MAX?!

My 2 favorite cokes is: coca cola with out caffein and pepsi max. Because both of them have less sugar.
Soda

B
i call it a fizzy drink or a soft drink
did anyone else notice the green glitching?new arg?
Click without reader the title. *WHAT!?!*
I find it kind of funny how Food Lion and Harris Teeter are treated as this "only in NC" thing, but I've seem both up in northern Virginia and even Maryland unless I'm mistaken.
#TeamPop
Really Mat really? No diet RC
The way I was so genuinely worried when I saw this title lmao
ok
Soo, anyone else see the video glitch at 13:31 and think it's arg time
Coke is okay but..     ✨✨Have you ever had Diet Coke???✨✨✨
I don't know if anyone else noticed that there is that weird thing in the middle of the video I tried my best to slow it down see something but I couldn't find anything
Mine was DC (all anyone drank in my house for the first 7 years of my life was Diet Coke)
WAIT! Matt lives in North Carolina? I thought he moved and lived in LA a while ago?
Matpat: I Quit diet Coke  Me: "This is pretty serious stuff"
Pop
Either Matpat mistyped or the description has some sort of Arg thing in it
Impossible
I’m glad that he actually said coke every one forgets it
D. I call it whatever comes out my mouth
Why did I think you guys were moving to Hawaii?
I don't like the soda because it's disgusting

I used to get wasted on shasta cola!.there is this one buddy I hung out  with and everyone partied with,I would get a 12 pack of shasta cola and we would mainly just drink that and watch cartoon network.it was hella fun!
STEPHANIE WE LOVE U
C Coke. Always
blink 10 times in your next video quickly if you're being held hostage and being told to say i quit diet coke
the title is a line I would have never imagined matpat saying
I haven't even watched 20 seconds and I will make this claim right now: Coke from mainland China is the best. Literally. Is soooooo much better and once you try the US made one again it tastes like pure sugar DDDDDD:
When did they move to North Carolina from California?
New breakthrough- Always include citric acid in your coke. Just so mat pat likes it.
Stevia is far healthier, but it's not great in large quantities. Erythritol works much better for a healthy sweetener, but I'm not aware of any sodas using it.
How do you get so many likes in 18 minutes

Hey don't you know about aspritain and that it can cause cancer

I got a screenshot of what looks like a screen glitch, but it's in the video itself
Green Cola An unmatched taste, zero calories, no sugar, sweetener from the stevia plant and caffeine from green coffee beans! Not coke brand, different cola, it is my favorite drink and ethically sourced.
That's a sin MatPat, you can't replace Diet Coke
Talk about a dark horse upset.
13:30?
do ya know water right?
YOU QUIT DIET COKE
B
no not diet coke
I live in NC and I have a Food Lion right next to my house so yeah I do know of food lion mat.

Who else saw the greem glitchy thing on thr screen?
How did you know i was having diet coke 😭
I noticed how when step jumped back from the taste of one of the sodas matt immediately reaches for her shoulder and I find that a cute detail
What sorcery is this!?!? Our master quitting the nectar of the Gods The world is truly ending!!!!
Sooooo...it's The Bachelor, but with sodas. Cool.

Pepsi max is tasty and good for you try that

B. Soda
13:31 the screen bugs out tell if you see it too!
I say soda "sodie pop" because of my ohioan grandma  edit: all the times when green was flashed on screen:  4:05 - 4:06 8:09-8:10 13:30-13:31 there was also a random shift in the amount of zoom, but I think that was just a jump cut. As for the green glitches, I assume its somehow clues to an ARG, clues to channel lore, or just put in there to confuse randos like me on the internet.
Pop
13:30   there was a tv static flash in the screen ARG or regular glitch? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Im in Louisiana and we say "Col' Drank" lol
9:36 yes
Living in North Carolina, I knew all of these names of the stores and it felt weird for them to be explained

Matt that was dirty putting Duke in the video when they aren't even in the tournament this year. Great video none the less
D: here in England, we call them either fizzy drinks or their name! We also call it coke, but never cola, soda or pop
At 4:06 wired green lines??
Me: **Looks at title** Also me: You have betrayed your own community!!!
Before watching video: Why are you replacing Diet Coke with another soda? Why give it up unless you’re trying to be healthier, ergo just not drinking soda?   Oh, just testing different ones XD Just for fun. Clickbait. Ok. Hahaha
Pop
We just call it a drink over here in the uk, we don’t have a name for carbonated drinks like coke
The only good thing to do is go to Burger King and pick vanilla Diet Coke

Few words: Why Matt Patt
Wow im early
Food lion is actually something we all know in belgium (i think) called Delhaize
When I first found out about this channel, I was elated as a nutrition-interest young lad - a charismatic dude like Matpat making content about food, what else could I wish for? Therefore I am a little disappointed to find out that it's really not about nutrition at all. I was moreso expecting a deeper dive into perhaps the lesser known facts about nutrition that may currently be controversial within mainstream media or even the scientific community. But I guess it's again entertainment > education, though I personally think that more in-depth content about more practical and controversial food+health related topics would be just as, if not more entertaining.
Pepsi Max?
_Me doesn't knows why whenever I used to drank Diet Coke it'll get me all tired & running off to the Restroom or Bathroom. Why's that?..._                                               *(Nevertheless, me Mr. Amos)*

No chance no way he quit
Ah yes quitting diet coke for diet coke 2
I have to ask: who drank all the rest of the diet sodas from this episode, or is Mat drinking all of them before starting his new soda life.
My preferred drink is  1 part Dr Pepper  3 parts caffeine free Diet Pepsi.
the history of water cooling vs this two fresh videos one has no views and one is intresting imma go with this one
I'm from Washington State and we alternate between saying pop and soda
I’m a canned Dr Pepper girl. Followed closely by bottled Big Red. Clearly I live in Texas. 😄
I never call sodas/pops  soda or pop I just call it by their name or I called them soft drinks
*Before watches video; reads the title.*  Me:  He switched to Diet Pepsi, didn't he?  That scoundrel.  Also when it comes to Boylan, they're known for their old school, syrupy flavor sweetened with cane sugar.  A diet Boylan flavor, you're getting NOTHING but that syrupy flavor, hence its cough syrup taste.  2nd edit:  B - soda.
Soda
Calling it right now, this is about the artificial sweeteners that degrade into neurotoxins, that they put in diet sodas. One minute and 41 seconds in and my theory is already disproven.😒 oh well may as well just enjoy the video.
I'm either a pop or fizzy drinks guy
I've never clicked on a theorist vieeo so fast
Me, who loves Zevia 😥
no.  way.
In my mother’s home state they say fountain drink. I grew up with both soda and pop

I will never drink Coke or other products from Coca-Cola for other reasons. Still a great vid Pat; hope, for your skin's sake, you stay away from Coke.
"i quit diet coke" "dear god" "theres more" "NO!"
Right now we are all still watching this right now
Ditch the soda! Drink water and stay hydrated.

Hey Mat- there is this thing called water- it is -much better for you and your health then the sugar and chemicals in soda-“sugar free” doesn’t mean chemical free-
Soda
Plot twist : The Winning Cola is actually Diet Coke in disguise. [ Edited : Hopefully this revision to the original comment doesn't spoil anything for more people.  To me it's weird that people go to the comments before watching the video first, lol.  My bad y'all.  ]
It's pewds whiskey taste test, but pg 13

IMPOSSIBLE NO
SHUT THE FRONT DOOR
WHAT
YYYYYYYYY
Oh nooo did he go back to drinking it? I thought he wanted to quit
Would you consider making a theory concerning palm oil and the use of it in food, or rather, if it should be avoided, it seems like an important topic. I feel really sad when I encounter it in food and I wonder if it's really as bad as a lot of people say.  Also, arent there substances in "no sugar" (with sweetener stuff) products that are... debatable, its something that can affect the brain, I dont remember, could be worth looking into tho (partly because your brain seems kinda precious but also because Id like to know the truth about that). Until then I'll keep buying coca cola with sugar in it.  Edit: I read up on the Aspartam stuff after seeing some of the comments, and while I already knew it wasnt causing cancer, it can apparently be dangerous to people with a certain condition, but the thing I am concerned about is the idea that it could have some kind of ties to Alzheimers, or any very similar disease.  I know it sounds dumb but apparently there is reason to think this.

I feel this video isn’t really a food theory but just a excuse to have all that Diet Coke XD my favourite Diet Coke is soda fountain when it’s done right recently all my local places have been giving me less syrup then normal :/
i find glass bottle and plastic bottle are different and the glass bottle in my opinion taste better.

Just drink Walter man, its not that Hard, either soda will not be better
WHAT?????
I have not watched this video yet, but I predict that boylan soda will be up there because that brand makes some top tier stuff.
Anyone else get a sodastream commercial as soon as it won
He needs to get on Ale 8. Best soda ever
me who lives in South America: these names mean absolutely nothing to me
Coke Zero is obviously the best
Who is this guy and why is he on this channel saying they quit diet coke?
I perfer the fountain too
Wtf
MatPat, I have an Idea for the last quadrant: Book Theory. A lot of movies and games started as books. Also, you can talk about certain authors, and what made them write these books.
I say use normal coke, it’s more healthy than Diet Coke
At 4:20 I was screaming YES! Soda like Diet Coke can taste so differently based on where you get it. Like some restaurants have disgusting water so the soda also tastes gross it’s a gamble with restaurants and the soda. The bottle and can don’t taste the same either. In all these places it’s a different experience. To me canned Diet Coke is more crisp and refreshing while bottle is more subtle and well put together; I think this is because can soda is really a one and done situation. With canned soda you don’t want to save it cause it just ruins the experience and nobody really likes leaving open cans outside, I have fears that bugs will enter the drink. With bottles you can save it so it isn’t trying to be that fast experience it’s trying to be slow because it is designed for a longer consumption. Fountain to me tastes a little watered down and weirdly sweet; maybe that’s because you’ll find fountains at restaurants or Sam’s Club and many places in the US give free refills so Coke doesn’t want you to think you’re getting a better deal at those places than buying their product first hand. Also could be cheaper for those establishments to buy it watered down or different from the bottles or canned product. This is al just a guess I’ve done no research.  Ps. I like fountain soda but there are a lot of places where you can have a bad experience and my reason was for that specific experience. I drink more bottles but fountain can sometimes be better depending where you get it from.
oh no
I saw the title and said this is clickbait but sadly it isn't....
Ah yes, I'll go down to my local fry's. Rip to a real one. 23:14
1:14 what about in the spice episode one of the “cures” you tried was diet coke if you did quit diet coke in 2020 how did you use it as a possible cure
Well diet coke can make you hungry
As someone who uses stevia in my coffee, its taste can take awhile to get used to. RIP zevia and whole foods.

Don’t drink soda (fizzy drinks in general), but VERY interested in this episode.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
He gave up Diet Coke for 2020?  But didn’t he use it in his Hot Ones food theory episode? (Which was uploaded in October of 2020)
This looks important....
HOW CAN HE BERTAY THE DEIT COKE
18:56 These two literally share the same braincell. It's so frigging cute ^w^
Noooooooooooooo - Darth Vader

best theory yet
You had me at the title
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We all know the superior drink is water
Thus marks the end of an era.

“She doesn’t drink as much diet cola as I do” does anyone?
McDonald’s has the best Diet Coke, please tell me I’m not the only one who thinks this

Me: *reads the title* "That's suspicious...... That's weird......."  Also Me: "Good luck with that Mat."
COKE ZEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

ME: sees title  ALSO ME: I give it 2 weeks.. no 2 days
The tweeter(Harris teeter) and the growler(food lion) are winners in my book
Not possible!!!
Finally. You changed.
Food theory was made with this purpose in mind
...what's going on at 8:10?   ...another code?
This instantly got my attention as soon as I read the title
I'm 11 and I love your videos I've been watching for years on all the theory channels and it has given me a new perspective on a lot of things. Thanks for making my life better.
Trust me, the Boylan normal coke is real good, I haven’t had the diet but from your reactions I ain’t missing much 😂
Diet peepper oh come on
Me: sees title  Also me: IMPOSSIBLE! THIS CAN'T BE THE REAL MATPAT! if anyone remembers the scrill episode that he did, than this is obviously the scrill who made this video!
Tbh I thought diet coke would secure the ring before she would
Everyone when they see the title: *Impossible*
This title is inpossible
i remember when you made diet coke jokes almost every video you made on Game Theory
If Dr pepper isn't a cola then what is it?
ExUsE mE wHaT
Matpat is making fun of people Who are actually have quitting problems   #cancelmatpat2021         This is joke btw. But if you want cancel Matpat go for it

PewDiePie quits Minecraft MatPat quits diet coke This is it guys, the Endgame.
I used to drink Zevia, but it was a bit overpriced. Zevia is an acquired taste. Of these, Diet Rite is my favorite. I try to avoid aspartame.  C: Coke
The thing about soda and diet soda is that these will weaken your bones over time. this is more true for females but this happens for males as well.
Peach soda is basically the best but there is also watermelon and imo ginger ale
I never thought it would come to this-
Me seeing the title: Oh reeeeaaaaallllly now?
Impossible
Whats up MatPat! Zevias awsome right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, this is more important than st judes donations
10 minutes and we have so many views, that's the power of Mat trying to give up on diet coke.
I love zevia
Mat pat x diet coke 2012 - 2021
Zevia actually used to be delicious and it might have done better if not straight up won but recently they switched out the erythritol for stevia because they were getting flack for being called zevia but not using stevia.. huge bummer
Is this not an incredibly biased experiment?? Because he knows which 2 soda he's drinking each time. Of course he's going to keep choosing diet cola.
Hey theorists. Hope all of your days are going well and I hope y’all enjoy this video.

Wear yellow if you were kidnapped
I drink both Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke so this was very interesting
Wtf NOOOOOO
when matpat said he at his home in north carolina I was confused I thought he lived in california.
“Frescas” are absolutely amazing. It’s sparkling water and not soda but it truly is something worth trying.
you forgot glass bottles
This is because they never sponsored him lol
Now now hold on just a flippin minute
Diet cherry 7 UP is the best
Yay
ah so he's a coke man, gooood. (as in the soda)
I refuse to believe that matpat, my favorite theorist that's addicted to diet coke, is quitting.
Don't worry guys, it's not true, it's just a theory
Try diet Sprite it taste the same
EMERGENCY MEETING

Perhaps Senku Cola from Dr-Stone
You should check out this series called “Angelica” from dragon sheep studios, you won’t be disappointed(at least It hope you won’t), so far there are two episodes, with two videos being half and half of the second episode (btw this has nothing to do with the Rugrats)
YYYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
I was always relatively thin. When I hit 33, I realized I had gained 30 lbs and was 202 lbs. I quit soda completely in March 2020. As of today I am 173 lbs.
41,925th view!
Who else saw the title and thought it was prank
You quite :O this is the most interesting theory
Title : exists   Everyone : *finally mat got off his coke diet addiction*
Who else replayed the glitch at 8:10 because they thought it was an ARG clue?
The fact that Diet Coke has yet to sposor this channel is astounding XD
Lair!
My mom only buys bottled Diet Coke 🤮🤮🤮
When I see the title, I knew something was up.
All soda is slow-acting poison, including diet. Drink kombucha instead.
Diet Coke. That is all I’ll say
RC!
I wish tab was still around but it was discontinued December 2020
He could never give up Diet Coke!!!!!!  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
It’s my b-day today coming home rn and this is perfect to watch while I wait to go home
Impossible
Plot Twist: They were really gathering bottles to test out five-minute crafts
I am CONVINCED that MatPat only created Food Theory so that he could either list buying a lot of food as a business expense or so that he could eat a lot of food
Matpat, there is a differencen betweem plastic and glass bottles, why did you not include it?
Good christ, it's about time. Diet Coke is so awful for your body.
Coke cola: UH OH All other cola sellers: This is our time to shine
0:40 and the hazbin hotel vid. I loved it but BOI are people pissed
I find it worrying that matpat could tell which glass whas from the can just by looking at it
What do Jotaro Kujo, Matpat, and Stephanie have in common?  *They are all aging backwards.*
No.
Me: reads title Also me: Impossible.
Nice
10 minute squad!
THIS SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE!
The one time I hope the title is clickbait.
ARE YOU SERIOUS? When I saw this pop up in my notifications right now, I was like "right, I doubt it" but then again, if he made a whole video about it, then maybe yes
Me when I read the title:      My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day, is 𝙍𝙐𝙄𝙉𝙀𝘿.

PEPSI MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!

Diet Coke incident
REJECT DIET COKE EVOLVE TO DR. PEPPER CREAM
So important
pewdipie just uploaded that his done with minecraft, I'm done 2ith my life edit: I'm done with my grammar as well
Fun fact: Soda was originally made to be medicine. So it's not that surprising a soda that stays true to the recipe tastes like cough syrup.
I don’t even know you anymore
we must now say goodbye to mats and cokes wonderful broken relationship 😔
Remember, once humanity hits rock bottom, they can only go up (hopefully)
For people who say you cant learn from youtube i learned today at least twenty difrent ways to say addict
thats not a fair comparison. our taste buds detect fizz as bitter. so extra sugar is added when there's more fizz. ie straws add fizz and pouring from a bottle adds fizz. but drinking from a can doesn't.  so sugar is removed from big bottle drinks small bottled coke isn't as sweet. and fountain depends on the machine. it can vary from one mc Donalds to another
He needs food therapy
You should have put "(Emotional)" in the title.

This is not ok where is my our mat pat
I saw the title and immediately knew this is an urgent case
The title sounds like he’s quitting a alcohol addiction
corn
Diet DrPepper is the best, he had to disqualify it, because it would be unbalanced.      Totally...
So what you're saying is "The Man Behind The Diet Coke" is no longer here..?
Matpat saying that Dr pepper is a not coke me: IT CREEY COKE
Nooooooo!
SUGGESTION: TRY CREAM SODA ITS SO FLIPPIN GOOD
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Pepsi Max is Diet Coke except better in literally every way
I rushed here seeing the title and I'm scared.
Good job! Even when I was a kid my dad and my dentists told me that normal coke is better than coke
I wonder if Matpat ever considered Moxie.
Crystal Pepsi is still in Canada
I well I can’t believe that
2021 just keeps punching
Oh god as soon as I saw the title I had to come running and stop watching the show I was wanting to watch originally  EDIT: So I work at King Soopers (which I believe is a Colorado only grocery store) and this actually upsets me that they have good sodas because Krogers is so horrible to their employees at times
Just put on captions at 3:47 it’s uh... yeeaa
NO!!! THIS CANT BE!!!
Pepsi is better
Any fountain drink has more sweetness
Haha, Die hard Diet Coke fan?      More like Diet-Hard fan        What is my life.......
NANI WHAT THE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DON'T HURT YOUR SELF FOR VIEWS   wait matpat would never give it up i don't belive it
The title doesn’t make sense, it’s saying it’s a theory and then making a statement
Do you selebrate pi day?
I didn't think I could quickly a video so fast...
Pepsi max
Irn bru is one
That's an absolute lie. Didn't mommy tell you lying was wrong?
This is more important than what ever I was doing  Dr. Pepper.

The world has ended and the  apocalypse has begun when Mattpat gives up Diet Coke

I read the title and said, "Clickbait."
Number 9 is SO STRONG THAT I CAN SMELL IT FROM MY PHONE
MY RELIGION HAS BEEN REPLACED? HE'S QUITTING DIET COKE?
But...                           It's a part of your identity at this point
Coke is theory Force MATPAT!
But what about the sponsorship ship dream
no way, there cannot be any way that matpat would quit coke, this is just one of those realistic dreams I keep having it has to be.
you cant replace diet coke its the best
Matpat: gives up on diet coke  People on the internet: impossible!  Fans: wait that's illegal!
What?!!! That’s not good
B
I need to see some charts showing which Northern States favor Coke, Pepsi is king in the North.
But Diet Coke is nectar of the Gods, MatPat!
**reads title** Me: ahem *w h a t*
Cherry pepsi is the best! If say something else you are a heretic! Diet coke is accepted for matpat.
I have thought for years mat pat lived in California
are you ok mate diet coke is a god drink
Thare goes the sponser
Me: this is exciting  My inner theroist: this could change fade buds I feel bad and excited at the same time
Zero calories ... How does that work .... Nothing can be zero calories....
NOOOO
I'm not a soda person but I do like sweet tea
But you’re not going to be going for fountain Diet Coke! A flaw in the testing
You did WHAT NOW
I may be crazy, but water is a healthy suggestion
My sole has left my body
McDonald's diet coke Is the best
Original style Sodas from way back are closer and closer towards classic style Root beer, which tastes, smells, and is even sold in the exact same bottles as Cough syrup. When they stated 2 tasted and smelled like cough syrup I knew instantly which brand it was from the 100 years unchanged recipe fact.
No one:  Matpats subscribers: intense worry from the title
after i saw the the title my first thought was “no way”
please try sarsi its a good soda please
Matt, we know you just want to write of soda as a business expense. You don't have to hide it.
MatPat gave up Diet Coke for all of 2020! Not any year *THAT* year!   *confidence* *that* *I* *can* *finish* *my* *essay* *restored* *!!!*
There is NO way matpat is gonna quit diet coke( I didn’t see the video yet so I have no idea)
Holy crap  I haven't watched the video yet, and I have to theories for this video: 1. Your lying to yourself the whole episode 2. You made a really complicated mixture that tastes good.
Its the end of the world as we know it guys.

Thx
Coca-Cola is going bankrupt without Matpat
NO MAT NO HOW COULD YOU D:

These are the food theories we need.
Im not going to kick my Diet Coke addiction thank you very much
Why Mat Why?
Everyone talking about Mat quitting coke but I'm just happy Steph is still being active on Food Theory
I'm in class and I can't hear it but I am still very concerned.
MATPAT THIS ISN'T WHAT WE MEANT WHEN WE SAID THAT YOU NEED TO GIVE UP YOUR DIET COKE ADDICTION!                     You should have a curiosity cola addiction instead *wheeze*
I wish mat lost diet coke on the first round
Coke zero and diet pepsi and pepsi zero are all better tasting
Try Pepsi
*sees title     *unsubscribes
I was in the middle of my "stalking-my-crush-session" but this seems much much more important!
My worse nightmare matpat Quiting diet coke nooooooooo
I like coka cola zero.
*Everybody’s gangsta until MatPat announces he quits Diet Coke*
MATPAT gives up diet coke? no way not possible isn't happening impossible. IM NOT BUYING IT
IT CANNOT BE  NOT DIET COKE  MATPAT AND DIET COKE ARE LIKE YIN AND YANG, INSEPERABLE  I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT
Take the blue pill to wake up and live reality where mat pat drinks Diet Coke and has the dadpat hair cut.  Take the red pill and you live like normal and he doesn’t drink Diet Coke.
xd

Annnnd this is when the world ends.
I don't believe you gave up diet coke I don't believe

The subtitles tho   “Let’s get p*** friends”
Matpat is awesome I've seen all the food theory videos
After reading this title, I believe a moment of silence is needed for this occasion

Are you sure
First Stephanie and now Diet Coke!? What's happening to the Theorists??

This is truly a dark day. THE DIET COKE EPISODE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST ONE
Hi
Matpat try apple fanta, its sooo good.
Why don't you just like stop drinking soda all together?
I feel a disturbance in the theoryverse
How. HOW. THERE ARE 2,238 COMMENTS AND THE VIDEO HASN'T BEEN OUT LONNG ENOUGH FOR ANYONE TO HAVE WATCHED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THE EPISODE.
Not possible
I was gonna recommend indian jeera soda just to mess with em,but it's really not something you inflict on another human being
wait huh-
Dr Pepper is the next best thing
impossible
Could just be a way to use diet coke as a business expense for tax write-offs....
My favorite "soda" is juice with seltzer water
"I QUIT diet coke" Yeah thats not Matpat. DONT TRY TO TELL ME OTHERWISE !!!!
Everyone Listen, we are in a dream and will wake in 10 minutes.
Diet Coke was the most important character of Food,Film & Game Theory as well as GT Live
Diet coke is disgusting tastes horrible. I had a soda addiction I have been soda free for over 2 years.  But right before I before  quit soda  coke a cola came out with coke zero sugar it tastes just like regular coke!
They said it could not be done
Calm down guys, he's probably just trolling us, or testing some other sodas that might be better then Diet Coke (doesn't exist)...or maybe its just clickbait or smthing
I'm sorry Mat. Monkee see, MONKEE DO!!!!!
HE WHAT?!
The title of the video should be: Diet coke addict tries other types of sodas
What how
I've never clicked so fast lol!

Things I’ve learned from Matt Patt: -Diet Coke -Red Jacket -FNAF -Dad jokes that I actually like -Good Minecraft Lore Theories -Figure out how to do math for about 16 minutes

Impossible. One does not simply just quit drinking Diet Coke.
I expected Matt of all people to start a diet coke March madness tornament

Now imagine he gets a Diet Coke sponsorship after this video.
Why is this not a sofa video. This very serious mat pat. Nor more diet coke joke.
I don’t like Diet Coke, I haven’t seen the whole video, but I’m actually shocked he quit
Life is meaningless and in the end we will all die.
Please MatPat, stop with scary titles. You made me yell in fear during zoom class.😔
Obligatory comment based off the title without even watching the video: No you don't.

Holy crap, this is huge
Try Cocta     Btw old recipe is better
He should quit diet coke anyway because it has been proven to increase the chance of developing Alzheimer's. Manly because diet coke has artificial sugar.
To all the people who got here first I wish you a very pleasant day afternoon and night
Matpat is like Tanner from Dope or Nope he can tell between restaurants soda and canned soda
I read the title and I was like: 😱😱😱
Sees title "Is this clickbait?"
fans drew matpat to the diet coke and now one cant exist without the other, is this the end of food theory or will this episode be short lived though acttually there is a 17 cent/p cola that is really cheap because it barely has any sugar and stuff.
You're already too deep
haha fruna for the win  rise chileans   and south americans maybe too idk
The sugar in Diet Colas can cause cancer due to the fact that its treated with a chemical that can cause it.
Impossible!
I DONT BELIVE THIS
What happened? what did you do to not like coke anymore (diet)
I saw this tiktok
No this can’t be happening this is not real

this would've been a great episode to finally get the overdue diet coke sponsorship
I was relaxing on my couch one day and I see on notifications: “I quit Diet Coke” No....
MatPat: Quits Diet Coke   Everyone: Wait that’s illegal
Everyone right now: Impossible.
matpat: I quit diet coke me: impossible
How come all the g's like mat pat and Mr beast live in North Carolina

THATS ILLEGAL
I mean I was doing chores 🤷 but this seemed way more important
*No..... IMPOSSIBLE*
*_R.I.P Diet Coke_* *_The addiction will be missed_*
I never though i will ever see the day he will every show this, nor ever though of it.
Haven’t started the video but I’m guessing that Diet Coke is some kind of poison if someone like mat is quitting it
It would be funny if the title is "I quit coke" LOL 😂
WHAT NO THIS MUST BE FAKE THIS CANT BE REAL
Diet Dr Pepper is the true nectar of the god

Matpat quitting Diet Coke. Impossible
Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment. .
Title: Me: Can one of you guys call a doctor, I think Matpat is not okay?
You should not be drinking any diet drink. The reason that you have the same taste as the regular soda is the sweeteners which are incredibly bad for you and can even cause health problems
I knew this was more important than global warming and crisis
How long until he refutes the title?  I'm betting five days.
Ok
I don't think I've ever been this early😅😅😅
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
i am drinking coca cola not diet
Hooray! Sorry Pat, love your shows, not a fan of the Diet Coke obsession.

I saw the title and immediately went SCOTT OR DISNEY GOT SCOTT AND REPLACED HIM WITH A CLONE
Look I’m early
The intro always reminds me of jojo (I've been wanting to say that since the beginning of the channel)
Moral of the story, MatPat iconic for a lot of reasons
"Sees title"  Me: Impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete

Me: sees the the title says l don't believe it at all
Diet coke is the nectar of the gods      It shall never be replaced.

I'm in the middle of studying for an important exam. I saw the title and immediately clicked it. Mat has been obsessed with diet coke for years. I've got to know what's up
It is the end of an era ladies and gentlemen, for today we have lost the nectar of the gods
no you did not!
Nice video
MATPAT WITHOUT DIET COKE: the world is coming to an end
Matpat quiting diet coke is like the ninja turtles quiting pizza
WHAT NOOO Diet Coke IS ICONIC WHAT CAN POSSIBLY REPLACE IT
I'm kind of glad, but I also kind of don't want to believe it.
The legend told us it was impossible.
It was your favorite. Also try squirt it's AMAZING  (really I only know it cause of Starkid musicals which you should watch MatPat)
What I thought Diet Coke was your favorite your wife must have told you to stop
Sprite
Food Theory: Probably not
Hey Mat, you released your April Fool's Video early.
You can’t quit your addicted
Seeing the title made freak out! First I read Quit then Diet Coke.
BUT WHYYYYYY
Diet Pepsi???
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
when i saw the title: oh my god
Matthew stop.
I never got people who thought diet coke was healthier. It's proven to be worse in some ways.
MatPat quitting Diet Coke? That’s less likely than a food company making a gaming console. Wait
* C O N F U S E D S C R E A M I N G ! ?*
Let's see if you can find your perfect soda. MatPat ❤️ Diet Coke
This episode was inevitable 👀
Hi mat 👋
Me reading the title: I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE LIAR, by the way, you're not a very good liar
I read the title and clicked on immediately
Nooooooo please Diet Coke is my life
Also I subbed on the first video I saw of the theorists channels

Hello
I wonder if MatPat will ever get a life size Diet Coke plushie
I looked at the title and said "no... say it ain't so..." MatPat and diet coke go together like Batman and Robin. Fitting, because Diet Coke is about to get killed by this video.
Matpat : I quit Diet Coke  Me : this is mutiny
no
Whaaaaaaaa?!?!?! 😳😮
Fanta gang would be happy to accept you
YouTube: there are 700 comments on this video. Me: ... Will you show them? YouTube:
Another episodeeee
I was hoping he’d just pick diet Pepsi’s or something xD
Diet Pepsi is just diet coke
Coke Zero is the superior Diet Coke.
This is hard to believe
THE TITLE, I came here faster than the flash
hmmm im givin special points to chrry pepsi .......I know i am discusting :(
He’s pissed because he’s STILL not sponsored.
No this is a sad time, I am so sad. Diet coke has fallen. Also I'm really surprised Pepsi Max didn't beat diet pepsi. And I can't even try the winner because I'm in the uk. Now everything there is just depressing.
Wait he’s joking right??? Please tell me he is joking
Early lol
The king of diet coke is going away?
