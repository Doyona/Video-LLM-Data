Right foot left foot😮 come Son, chill
Thanks Son!
little did he know, maddison would alter join spurs
who's here after SON missed that sitter vs city to deny Arsenal the title. He did it on purpose!
Korea national HERO🎉
The reactions of the defenders and goalie say it all. Too good.
This was incredible game
I absolutely love sony
Watching Maddison score on us after he’s signed feels real weird
Incretble
그저 손흥민이라 가능했디
빛 흥 민
I like you Heung min son, you are my favorite player and I like spurs
I love you sonny
Yes! More than respect! Let’s go sonny~
Why did they retake the penalty? That was a clean stoppage, right?

See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.   (Deuteronomy 32:39-41) - 회개하세요. 심판주되신 예수님 곧 오십니다.

Son need new team , really
SON!!!!!! Crazy man!!!!!!!! I'm not korean  I'm yun suk lull
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:10-11  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..

Congratulations from the Blue third of London! Credit to Conte's team, they're free-scoring atm.
what a great ball .what a hatric.
5-3-2 system is much better

Sonny nominated for goal of the month with 2/3 of his goals in this game.  Amazing!

지금 여기에 댓글을 달고 있는 순간조차도 대한민국인이라는게 자랑스럽다! 나는 한글로 댓글을 달고 있다! 손! 지켜주세요! 손은 대한민국의 자랑입니다!
Leicester should try another strategy of *NOT SCORING FIRST*.  They always get punished afterwards
Son son crazy
https://youtu.be/fc8iuTBeMyM ۔
My eyes watered when Son scored the first, when he scored the second my mind was profoundly elated.
🇰🇷🍀☘ 대견하고 대단한 대한의 자랑스런 아들! 장하다~~^^👍
If he was a European, he would be easily a contender of ballon d'or every year.
he is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Son scored bangers with left and right foot so underrated 😢
!
We must give the Spurs legend the best possible treatment.  He is now treated worse than Oliver Skip or Ndombele.
Sonny the 👑
nice one sonny

야 이 토트넘팬도 아닌 주제에 토트넘 팬인척 하는 손흥민 악성팬덤들아. 손흥민은 토트넘을 떠나면 안된다. 니들은 세뇌당한거야. 극소수가 한짓을 마치 모두가 한것 처럼 알고있잖아. 너희들은 나라의 수치다. 토트넘이 얼마나 손흥민과 한국을 사랑하는지 알기는하냐? 배은망덕한 것들
Goll
흥민이형. 제발 토트넘을 떠나지 말아주세요. 토트넘 팬도 아닌 주제에 토트넘을 떠나라고 재촉하는 한국인 팬들은 축알못이니깐. 지금 콘테도 있고 우승하기 딱 좋은데 다른 팀으로 떠나면 안되죠. 사디오 마네 못보셨어요? 팀을 떠나면 부진을 겪을 수 있다니깐요. 토트넘에 남아서 토트넘의 레전드가 되는게 최고의 선택입니다.
World class. Son:   Golden boot winner without penalties FIFA Puskas award  Consistently highest shots to goal ratios His ability with both feet is once in a generation  Carries the team to Champions League   Fan’s:  boo him after a few games with Contis terrible tactics.  I hope he finds a better club
Nous  somme le meilleur  , nous sommes prés pour  amener le coupe à la maison , je suis supporter Sénégalais  de tottenham
Are we not going to talk about these shyte penalty re-takes these days. There is nothing wrong with that first save. Refs basically want keepers to stand absolutely still without flinching to make sure the shot goes in.
His left and right foot was really scary
Son son son 💯💯💯
Sanchez really is not an intelligent player...such a stupid tackle
근데 만약 겨울이나 여름에 이적시장 나온다면 손흥민 어디로 갈까 리버풀은 윙어보다 다른 포지션 살거 같고 맨유나 첼시...? 지소연 황희찬처럼 개고기송 듣고 뛸 바에야 맨유는 안 가는 게 나을 거 같고 진짜 애매하네.... 그러게 서로 끝까지 윈윈하게 에이스 대우 좀 정상적으로 하지 기어이 unhappy 띄우게 만드냐 토트넘 빙신들아.....🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️
SON ,is the best
sonny is back!♥
아 현지 소식 보면 볼수록 왠지 점점 불안한게 내년에도 손흥민 또 이적 안 하고 탈출 못 할 수도 있을 것 같음.... 지금은 선수가 대놓고 언해피 사인까지 보여놓고 입국하긴 했지만  1. 콘테가 재계약 안 하고 나가서 다시 손케 투탑 or 케인 나가고 아직 계약기간 1년 더 남은 손흥민 원탑 중심 전술로 복귀 2. 콘테가 갑자기 기적적으로 고집을 꺾어서 그저 로테이션일 뿐이라는 개같은 변명을 멈추고 이번 시즌 내에 손흥민 볼 터치 패스맵에서 고립시키는 거 관둠, 페리시치 히샬 치우고 손흥민 골 최대한 넣을 수 있게 전 시즌 전술 복귀, 전 시즌 득점왕 벤치형벌이라는 전무후무한 개짓거리 반복 안함  만약 이 둘 중에 하나라도 이뤄지면 현지언론이 선수 기를 못 죽여놔서 안달이든, 멍청한 팬들이 감독 전술 탓은 안 하고 그저 쏘니이즈백~~~^^ 위러브쏘니~~  이러고 대가리꽃밭으로 떠들어도 손흥민은 토트넘에서 계속 뛸듯ㅅㅂ  지금 리그 내에서도 스쿼드 개같이 노답인 토트넘에 남아있었던 이유가 그나마 닥주전 보장이 된다는 점이었는데, 이번 시즌 들어 그게 안 되니까 당연히 언해피각이어서 드디어 내년에는 탈트넘을 하겠구나 했는데....  아 왤케 불안하냐 이적해서 죽이되든 밥이되든 딴 팀에서 뛰어보는 것도 좋다고 생각했는데 설마 또 재계약하면...?  영원히 토트넘에 바짓가랑이 붙잡혀서 굴려지다가 찐으로 폼 떨어지고 팀 붙박이 교체자원으로 남는 거 밖에 안 될게 뻔함

It's not a comeback since I've never left!

Which foot is his weaker foot 🤷‍♂, who knows he is just a living legend
too easy
Sonny's goals is what every forward would have hope for...but few would ever achieve...!  Humble yet brutally blunt opinion from a Toon Army for 22 years
never doubt son.
zz
Though all the goals from spurs players are worth meaningful for the team,, Spurs is not a heading goal FC.. we need more from these beautiful goals by Son and also Kane like last season. The dramatic counterattack goals and the shoots from outside the box really make the match more thrilling. Cant wait for the upcoming matches😂
did son's 1st shot actually hit the top net??
역시.... 쏘니....
1st ⚽️ is "pauSe"..2nd ⚽️ is "Silence" 🤫 & 3rd ⚽️ is inSpiration..coyS(on) 👏

son ❤️
Son basically gave a middle finger to those who ever doubted him. And I wanna say "You Were Never a Spurs Fan"  to those people. You Idiots  must have an amnesia or something. Never forget what Son has done for the Spurs and What Kind of History he made with Spurs.
멋지다..

Amazing performance from legend son❤️👍😘

The player who can score outside the box with his right and left foot equally is dangerous
Surprisedly Son is an underrated player... Very very good player
This guy is underrated.
One on the right, one on the left, and one in the center.
He Is Back!!!
Of course!! He's the king. KING is back!!!
Return of king
Son scoring with 2 legs 🦵 is so satisfying 🤤🤤🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
킹짱민
Danny Ward should just retire or maybe play for u23
손흥민 올시즌 끝나고 이적!!!
Why don't you know? It's Conte who he made that son is a useless player in the previous 6games Because of proving his 2players. We have to monitor and blame him when he use a rubbish tactic sometimes. Not blind admiration.
손의고국팬5천만과 손의팬등 1억이상은 기억한다..인간 모독적인 비판을 그동안 신나게 하드먼?..너흰 후회할거야..

Some of Tottenham's fans getting doubt about Son.. Look!! his First goal of this season with Hat- trick .. No doubt, he is Legend and world class
where is the conte cam
🔥🔥🔥
Others : "He is still best player"  Spurs : "No! We doubt him!"   Spurs = No loyalty, No balls
He is Korean!!
잘 풀려서 겨울에 이적한다고 해도 어찌됐든 올해는 계속 토트넘 경기 뛰어야 한다는게 제일 안타깝네..... 전 시즌 pl 득점왕을 감독픽 쌩신입이랑 주전경쟁 시키지를 않나, 타멤 위주 전술 짜서 정작 팀에이스는 볼 터치도 못하게 패스맵에서 고립시키지를 않나, 이번엔 아예 선발도 아니고 벤치출발ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  전술로 꼼짝도 못하게 기 다 죽여놓고 구단은 선수 기량이 떨어진것 마냥 몇주째 언플질;.. 그러다 골 터지니까 he is back!! 이러고 정신승리ㅋㅋㅋㅋ  이 시점에서도 오.. 쏘니는 토트넘을 사랑해~~ 오오 팀원들이 그를 안아주고 응원해주고있어!! 행복트넘^^ 이지랄하는 애들은 진심 지능에 문제가 있는거다 He is back은 무슨
Give to me conte cam!!!!!
What a game. Son is a crazy crazy guy.

Son should get out of Tottenham as soon as possible without wasting his talent.

Insane performance by son! What a hit !

I always said son heung ming is a top class player,he is the best and not given enough credit. He deserves a better team.

There is romance in Son’s goal
산체스 방출하고 진작에 김민재를 영입했으면 더 높은 순위에 있었을것이다.
안토니오 콘테씨, 쏘니는 공 주면 거의  다 넣습니다. 기억하세요. 토트넘ㆍ만세!
he's back! 할 때 눈물이 났다...
I've not met any football fan who dislikes Son yet.
Happy 🎉❤
Bentancur 👍
존나 잘하네  ㅅㅂ 깔수가 없다 궤적보소?
True A marvelous talent
Son is back
어나더 pleya son
와우son👍
Those who always complain don't deserve you. Let's move to another place Sonny. from home.
Son was on fire. 🔥🔥🔥
I respect him. He is always diligent, patient and humble. This guy is an authentic role model of everyone.
This guy left is something else, he did scored two different keeper in that angle, smichel and this keeper
손흥민 선수는 심각하게 이적을 생각해야 됨 그동안 팀에 해준게 얼만데 이런 푸대접 받고 심지어 욕까지 하는 홈팬들도 많았죠. 이런 쓰래기팀에선 또 골 못넣으면 똑같은 행동을 할겁니다.  손흥민 선수를 존중해주는 팀으로 이적하길 기원함
This is a team for EPL trophy 🏆 2022
I am a fan of every team except for Spurs but no one can deny the utter class that is Son he's always been my favourite player ever since I was born into a strict Spurs family and have only ever supported Spurs. COYS I am impartial Son is world class.

Hope my team Barca take son from this average team called spurs. We can have who we like, it's an honor to play for us but who even knows what spurs is? Have they even won the premier league or europe?
Son is an absolute legend: loyal, dedicated, persistent and prolific. An inspiration to us all. COYS!
Everyone should know by now that Tottenham don't deserve Sonny. And Conte has to change the trash tactics of killing Sonny using a ferry. The best thing is to transfer Sonny to Liverpool or Man City. Under the foxy conte, Sonny will be used and thrown away!
Im gonna cry...for that
what a goals, Son! Pure art! Good luck in this season.  YNWA
We know South Korea 🇰🇷 Buz of Him 💥  ~ Son Heung-min💎

The best thing about proper 3-5-2 is that it free up sonny and kane with more space! Sonny is definitely more comfortable in this format.
Son! Please join to the Aresnal. You will be a regend ever in history..
So proud and wonderful and wonderful
He is weak in defending..
2:02). hungminson clever 3 Goals. Funtastic ever 😁😂 Absolutely ! super hansom ☯️ Sonny is reall  very hungryㅡ

Tottenham fans fuck off!!! You don't deserve Son... Sonny need to transfer to bigger club
I doubt that any player at all, not just epl but in the whole world can shoot long range with both feet as good as Son. I Do Not Think there's any one else, period! He has been the Main Spurs guy for many years, think back about what he did for the club, now some idiots say he's not good enough!?! I wish Son gonna leave soon, bcoz i really Love to see them cry hard. You are Very Lucky to have a Rare Gem, recognize its Value & take Good Care of it. Otherwise u'll be Regret.
Son！！！
Heung-min Son makes me feel proud to be Korean. To be able to watch his matches live while I am alive is such an honor and event for me.
Experiment with Conte is now officially over!!!
He is the son of korea

Score with right foot OK, Score with the left foot no Problem
Son should have passed the ball to harry kane during final goal, but son played very good.
In 13 minutes.. what up M
Some Tottenham fans sent Son to hell when he couldn't score. Son escaped hell on himself and must now go to heaven. Is Tottenham a team that makes him play soccer happily? Son needs to think it over.

Harry, Son and Hugo did very well. But also Bentancur did a really good job in this game. His challenging pressure and key passes were really fabulous. Congratulations on his first goal and I hope he become a world-class midfielder with spurs.
Absolutely brilliant performance from Son,
자랑스럽다🇰🇷

Son on rampage
Conte cam?????
Leicester benar-benar kehilangan peter

Son scores after getting criticized, and put finger to silence the critics and get hero respond from public. Harry Maguire scores after criticism and put fingers in his ear to silence the critics and gets more criticism from everyone. Oh Harry 🤦🏻‍♂️

A Citizen , i don't like Son bcoz he is always disrespecting Man City, he is a true attacker

If conte leaves you bench or disappoint     tactically.    Just say  you will  migrate Liverpool
Son est le joueur le plus sous côté d’Angleterre

When so many of Tottenham's goals are headers, Son's mid-range shots are like deep three-pointers in basketball. So refreshing
Sonaldo
👍🏻🔥
I think Rodrigo Bentancur's performance was incredible in this game. He was a key man for win!
What an effort from bentancur for his goal
손뽕 차오르누...
son is back   👍  CLARK PLZ
Who has doubted Son since Richarlison's arrival? son its a beast.. actually
bench kane against arsenal , he will wake up a little too ..maybe he can cme on and score a hatrick..😅🤣😂😂
What a goals from a long distance!!! Classy
only  Perisic  can stop Heung-min Son ~😀😀
Am surprised no club bid for Son, man is a goal king
졸라 멋있네. 너 짱먹어라.

I wish Real Madrid have HM Son
SON IS FECKNG QUALITY!!!

This Son is just too good. Baba sharp. See excellent goals
Greetings from a Chelsea fan. Son – what a fantastic player! Pure joy to watch! I almost wish he won the league this year with Tottenham. If it's not us, then let it be Tottenham 🙂
Why watch it. I know the results.
Congratulations ❤️❤️

Admin where's the extended highlights?
Geez but liecester are the architects of their own demise
Leicester has no respect for its fans,the worst defense ever in the history of the club,even Jamie vardy can’t score anymore because of the poor midfield players who keep passing the ball backwards instead of pushing the ball forward,total rubbish. The goal keeper is not that good,yet they keep doing exposing him,Leicester need to buy new defenders as soon as possible,you cannot concede so many goals it’s utterly ridiculous.
I heard from Korean Sport Media that Son Heung Min wants to leave spurs, and likely to go to Man Utd.... "Man Utd fans love Korean players like Park, Sonny wants that"
Tottenham Hotspur, who gave up on signing Kim Min-jae, is finally regretting...
..and this guy doesnt need penalty goals to add to his tally..only screamers pls!!!
Right man in the Wrong team
SONNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 😭😆😆😆😆🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾
Congrats Antonio Conte
Who can score a 20m strike right foot and few minutes later a 20m strike left foot ??? Amazing Son !
Underrated stepdaughter becomes a hero😢
small club
2 stunners by Son. Alright.
Son of a Gun 💥💥💥🔫
Wanna see next b'dor
Hate me for saying this, but Son being benched for the first half isn't such a bad idea. Considering Son's strengths, it makes the defense all that much unprepared for his speed, positioning and finishing. The way he's used has been predicted and countered for so many games.  It's actually a miracle that Son has been producing results despite the opposition's aggressive defensive counter-plays.   Spurs needed to mix things up and this game showed how valuable mixing things up can be.
Although he scored three goals against Leicester City, he must have whipped and cried at himself in his heart
Heung-Min Son was put in and there was no more forward pressure from Leicester City. He is the most important player at the club and in Conte's tactics. But I want Son Heung-Min to go to a bigger club. No. That's why I can't see him always playing in second place. Now he needs a trophy
드디어!
Yea.. for the last 5 years.. he is the best Asian player.. no doubt.. no competition no debate about it.
Legend
Class!!!
brilliant
Son deserves respect from his team fans ㅡㅡ poor sonny
Never in dout
It's too bad that some spurs fan dis Son when he plays bad... I am not saying you shouldn't criticize. Some criticism is necessary to get better performance and get the player to develop but I am saying stop dissing him as if he doesn't belong to the team or in Europe... just treat him like you treat Kane or Dier
Those 2 goal were pure class
as a tottenham fan SON is legend 💯lets respect him
Son's curling shooting... is just on another level.
Next victim is Arsenal go go go spurs
中国何时会有一个孙这样的足球选手呀
Sorry to Spurs' fans but Son and Kane must leave Tottenham for their career
Plus when Kane had bad plays last season lol yall didn't say shit but son. Fucking racist just cuz son is Asian. Really fuck Tottenham yall don't deserve this man
My man Leave Tottenham. They have no respect for son.
Son is the real goat
There was also a man here who betrayed Sonny. garbage
I am RRQ & EVOS FANS son is Amazing XD
Now proved that strategies were wrong. Son is one of the best players who make a counterattack if there are empty places. Don't make son isolated using weird tactics.
🤍💙🤍
Cannot wait to see him transferr. Conte's new tactics doesnt fit him and will keep him as a sub.
What player amazing my Hiro son 🔥🔥🔥🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
You can do it SON !!!!!❤

I really enjoyed the Son part. That guy is a star at dribbling and taking long shots.
Son is back..... conte is a very mean manager... you can't keep a top player on the bench for too long... Harry Kane hug to Son was overwhelming to watch... two great players
Son on fire

son is spur legend..... respect
Welcome back, Son!
i think son with perisic lineup looks not good cause their style. No doubt perisic’s play. As Kane, Son should be position the first lineup.
I am a madrid fan because of sonny i never missed tottenham game.
this is my SON

Son deserves so much better !!
Fucking legend son is🔥
Same left footed goal from Son against Leicester last season
Son Hueng-Min 💪🏿
I can tell that manager Conte is experimenting several tactics including 3-5(Bissouma in the middle)-2(son& kane), which turned out to be a huge win on this game, by especially exploiting the long adjusted son&kane relationship (Impeccable!!!). Made me almost burst into tears when Sonny recorded the first goal. However, can never underestimate the magnificent assists from Bentancur, Kane, and Hojbjerg. You spurs are One team and this is so touching. Hope the newly joined lads also melt well into this One team spirit and make through the tough journey on October too. (Hope Conte finds ways to harmonize Perisic and Son on the pitch. Plz find ways to extract the bests from the both, not killing one for the other)
Mantap di trending 2
He's back. Like the man has been playing every week he's not been away
Happy for Son ❤️ he's back!! Right foot, left foot. Perfect
Chelsea fan but this son by Force should be given respect
Pray with me. I need your prayers, friends.
SONNY BOY BACK!
Aap ka video bahut Achcha hai, mera Video dekh kar bataiye aap log kaisa hai? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtube.com/channel/UCm3lig2K9Mpwx_YzRL0hixA
Son at his peak with full of good players in the squad, I can't miss every totenham match
Kerja yang bagus Son..
이야 기가 막히네요
Son must leave this kind of team...
I'm United fan because Son and Kane I always watch Spurs games..
손흥민 선수 골 넣었을때 울었어요ㅜㅜ 더이상 그를 의심하지 말라~왕의귀환 손흥민 화이팅❤
Wow
Conte and some tottenham fans are crazy. how  can Son be treated as a sub? hope this makes Son consider leaving Tottenham. He has been needlessly too loyal to this team.
Watching again and again❤️son❤
https://youtube.com/channel/UCJnDHjVh_5ebtubTqju4JJQ
It was my birthday and i was sick but Son made me smile even though i am not a fan of the club!
Darkness has gone, Sun is up again
As an arsenal fan for me son is great player ngl, respect
Finally I can see a glimse of the chance that Son will leave Tottenham. Son deserves better.
siapa kita? indonesia  siapa dia? son
(왕의귀환 손흥민) 이순간을 정말 기다렸네요 다시 보고 싶다던 감아차기골을 볼수 있게 해달라는 기도가 이루어진 순간입니다 손흥민선수 당신은 소중하며 존경하며 영원히 최고의 선수입니다 👏👏👏💯👍🥳🤫🤭🫶🤳
shit, son = shit ldk why people say he is the world classs he have to go to 2nd league
Why Lloris' penalty save didn´t count the first time but the second time is valid???
90 mins game with less than 2 mins of action. Hockey, may not be as popular..but it's far superior as a sport .
Im here for Heung-min and Harry 🇵🇱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
That’s why when I play fifa son is always there for finishing the ball 🙌🏾
3-5-2 oh my days
Sony
Don’t watch Football, more of a NBA fan. My roommate is a huge Son fan, he went on and on why this hat trick was so hype (going into details about position, etc, etc).   Pretty sure I didn’t understand half of it… but super cool to see an athlete from my country do so well on a Western league.  I didn’t have any “cool” popular role models who were Asian growing up in Canada… Didn’t have to be Korean specifically, there weren’t any that looked “like me”. We had Harold from Harold and Kumar and Han from Tokyo Drift… Bruce Lee was cool I guess, but the whole Kung Fu stereotype people do around you does get old super quick, especially if you are an Asian…that was pretty much my childhood looool. It really sucked as a kid… in hindsight didn’t mean much, but it definitely can affect children imho. The current generation youngsters are very lucky to have someone to look up to as a role model!
korea   son~~~~~
이제 그만 흥민이 보내줘라
Right feet and left feet in 15 mins. God the keeper couldn’t even touch the ball.
World class Son Heung Min come back
Yes
Son is just an unbelievable finisher! And impossible to dislike as well.   Hopefully Arsenal can keep him at bay in the upcoming North London Derby after the international break 🤕
Nice game son
Class is permanent 💙
He's back with 3~!!
All you haters who said Son was overrated when he didn't score over the first 8 games..y'all a bunch of dick farmers.  I'm a Son fan, but I sometimes think he should play for a club where the fans are classier..
There's nothing like weak foot for son
I've become a Spurs fan over the past few years.  This past 8 game stretch makes me almost believe that Son should play at a team where the fans don't only love you when the times are good... Shocking that there so many asswipe Spurs fans
Nice work...but ALL of you haters who piled on the BS when Son didn't score during the first 8 games, you're all just a bunch of douchebags.  You're colors shine and it's so unfortunate that there is such a large population of Spurs fans that are such dick farmers..
미쳤어!!!! brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant

I love son! Fking legend!
i teared so many time rewatching his scoring moments 😭 he's truly the best! i'll always support you Sonny (wherever you decide to go in the future). We just want to see you play happy football! 💙
Hope Salah and Ronnie Bounce back too😩
Believe that we are heading all the way to be title 🏆🏆🏆!
Come on your spurs
Good job spurs, GO go go....
Kenapa penalty nya diulang guys?
terrorist ball
Son Goku
He is back!!!!!!!
Vamos tothemham desde Perú
As aware, Son's strength and what he has clearly shown multiple seasons are his speed with space to run and "precision" finishes to help Spurs to finish the top 4 last season.  With Perisic right behind Son, Spurs now look for more of patient Futbol and taking time to provide header crosses and lots of lateral passes, which may be needed when other teams are packing down to defend.  Regretfully, this is definitely not leveraging what Son can do with his world-class goal-scoring abilities.  Perisic and Son need to be syn together to highlight both of their positives instead of minimizing or canceling each other.
Son should really leave Tottenham if he wants to win anything of significance and elevate his status.

💙😭🤘🥶
손흥민의 해트트릭에는 감동이 있다.
it was the first sporting event Saturday morning here in Arizona I was watching 30 minute compilation of Little Britain probably laughed about 20 minutes of it and it ends just in time for kickoff I turn on the game and tottenham's anthem is an American song  There is a James Madison on the field for LC and THEN I saw Son's last year's co Golden Boot award winner benched for the first half scores three of the most beautiful goals I've ever seen.  I think I'm turning British and I know for a fact I am a Tottenham Hotspur fan  GO SPURS. COUNT ME IN THAT NUMBER
Aa Really brought home how bad the situation is when the guy at the end expressed gratitude for simply having enough space to stand up inside his shared apartments.
Amazing son
🔥🥵🔥 ............... 🔥🥶🔥
Heung-min Son is unhappy at Tottenham right now. Tottenham need to transfer him.
I wish Son could go to Arsenal and smash Tottenham.
Son is back!!❤
He can’t go real Barca bayern Paris  Also chelsea mancity Liverpool  He’s touch and pass is terrible Big club winger should control the ball very very well and dribble very very well
Sooooooooonnnn🔥
Son Heung-min doesn't have to be loyal to Tottenham.  Look at those flip-flopper Tottenham fans.
Thank you very much❤
Son is simply MAGNIFICENT 😍
The keeper at 1:59 lmfao
Son goku 🔥🔥🔥
Relegation time for the fox  ..
It is wonderful hat trick, because  first goal xg is  0.05 , second 0.04,  third 0.25
Son is that guy 🔥
Never doubt SON. He will carry the team to the top just like he does every year. Enough said.
COYS
Never, Never, Never forget him. Tottenham fans have so far forgotten the sacrifices he has made to the team. Now even if he moves to another team, Tottenham have nothing to say.
HE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After rain comes the son
alleged arsenal fans in  this comment section kissing son's ass please stay on the shit side of london we don't need yall
son  is  my 해병대 후배
Leicester finished 😭
congrats Sonny!

Good one Son

Over 4 million viewers after one day of this clip.  Unbelievable.
I don't really know why in this world is SON very underated. Each day he proves that he is one of the best player 💯.
AMAZING, son is the greatest Asian soccer footballer in the Soccer Football history ❤❤❤
Strongly recommend you to leave the team treating you as a normal payer.  .l
🔥🔥 I’m YouTubar 🔥🔥 Ma youtouar hun 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Time to leave Son.  Many koreans think that you have to leave the team  not respecting you.
When would Leicester City FC appoint new manager?
Switching to a 352 haveing Son and Kane up top is something that would be destructive. As a Spurs fan always been saying any manger who puts those Son and Kane up top would get the benefits,   Against stronger teams the 352 works really well.  The 352 also lets the midfielders attack more as there is always two to cover.  The front line should be Son Kane and Kulu if its a 343 as that worked really well last season though the 352 also can be used. Every top team has 2 main formations
This spagheti coach just underestimated asian guy. Wake up conte he is one of the best player in premier league!
When I heard the chatter in the week with presenters discussing calls and tweets from spurs 'fans' calling for him to be dropped I thought I was hearing things.  He's your best player. If you don't want him, we'll have him at Liverpool.  Most spurs fans I know don't know thier football anyway so maybe I shouldn't be surprised..
I've never seen a player who takes longshot curlers with both feet as comfortably as Son in my lifetime. He does it like it's practice session over and over again. WT actual F? Unique player.
Шпоры красава💪👍,Сон монстр
토트넘에게 질렸다. 이적하자 손흥민.
Son took some time to find his mojo but it was worth the wait...!
Son is the real Oppa.. 🔥 Not BTS
Wish Conte would stick with old formation. Totteham is much more exciting to watch with Kane and Son in the front.
Sonny👍👍👍
Damn bro, Son never scores ugly goals. They’re almost always beautiful strikes ⚡️

Hello
Got me emotional looking Son score three beautiful goals, especially after Conte saying no one is untouchable and Son doing this, you gotta feel for Son. I teared up for him, I'm a Utd fan
Arsenal 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶  7 week in mountain
Son must leave Tottenham and go to Liverpool or Manchester City, probably Real Madrid where he will be treated as a forwarder not defender. Son is good at attacking not defending. Conte tactic doesn't fit Sonny.
SON  is already among the best in tottenham after GARETH BALE
sonaldo😎
Son is a monster 🔪🥶
Where are all the haters?
That Sonny second goal got ne shouting  " ohhh Goddd " at the television

Talk about a spurs future and present icon! Underrated is an understatement for Son
SONNY YOU ARE THE BEST PLAYER
I'm Japanese man city fan but also huge fan of son. Absolutely world class from Korea.What a player!!!
King.
What a player
손흥민... 흥해라!
Son is not a machine. He is a human being like us. He can't play every time like this game. A real fan of Tottenham You should also support him when he has a hard time. You never walk alone. This is all about sportiness.

Sad to see Sonaldo and Ronaldo underappreciated like this despite being top scorers last year. Always think what if they were English born? Would they get the same undeserved hate? Probably not...
Son estaba jugando al score hero
Absolutely a Spurs legend now. Don't know what to say more than that.
Wow what a match
Please add replay for every goal...
Leave Tottenham. Spurs don't deserve goals you create any more. So whimsical! Cunning betrayers!
Never in dout. Sonny didn't smile at all in pitch with hattrick.  Tottenham doesn't deserve Sonny. It's enough to be royal for 7years.
GLORY GLORY TOTTENHAM HOTTTTTTSPURRRRR ❤️🙌🔥👏😍

son...ㅠㅠ
Sonny has dreamed he would play for either Man.U or Real.  And this winter would be the right time for him to go for his dream.
I almost cried in the first goal and seeing Sonny stopped for a moment there.. 😭
흥민 축하해 너의 부진은 너의 탓이 아니었어 콘테의 잘못된 전술때문이라 생각해

Son....!!!! Amazing...
Son to Manchester United ❤
다시는 우리 흥민이 무시하지마, 토트넘 기자들아, 토트넘팬들아, 콘테 너도.
When so many of Tottenham's goals are headers, Son's mid-range shots are like deep three-pointers in basketball. So refreshing
waiting for the next video
I've literally watched this 10 times. I can't believe how amazing spurs performed. Amazing goals, amazing defence, Spurs where the top in every aspects. #COYS

If son was on any of the top 5 clubs in the world he would instanttly be conteding for Balland'or and in the all time legends list
손흥민같은 선수가 이런 클럽에서 충성하며 뛰는건 너무 아쉬워요. 당신은 이런 대접 받을 이유가 없습니다. 어떤 선택을 하든 응원할게요.

13분21초 동안의  해트트릭은  손흥민 드라마였다. 첫 원더골 넣은후 손흥민은 글래디에이터처럼 서 있었다. 동료들이 다들 와서 포옹하고 축하하는데 마음이 묵직하다. 관중들의 환호도 기쁜데 마음이 묵직하다. 8R 분명 축구를 보고 있었는데, 손흥민의 골이 감동의 영화로 바뀌었다.
Son was really pissed at the manager for dropping him
the way he scored with both feet from range just amazes me
Reporters who said rude things to him waited for him for more than an hour and a half. Stupid idiots.

Extended highlights, make one please. It is not enough to express the moment of great plays.

Never in doubt.
When pep realises he has to face this son: *chuckles* I'm in danger
Sonny. We are always  rooting for you no matter what.
sonny
Son deserves to play in a champion team not in SPURS
소설보다 더 소설같은 결과다
Two world-class goals and a hat-trick from world-class player👏
Best - SON
And just like he's back on the scoring chart like he never left. He needs to leave Tottenham for a top team tho.
He is back

손 제발 다른팀으로 가자  ㅠㅠ
개미쳤네
SO-NAL-DO! SON PERIGNON!! SON-HEUNG MESSI!!!
Fun Fact. Son's goals vs Leicester in the last 3 years are somehow similar. A breath-taking stunning shoot. 🔥
King is back
Son heung min👍
gold boot again~~~
He's back... back with 3 😤
Some of Tottenham fans blaming Sonny for no scoring don’t deserve to have Sonny.. He actually has carried Hotspur during last several years consistently scoring double digit goals and more importantly had Tottenham join Champions league last season. Given those great contributions, loyalty and capabilities shown already, they have little respect to him, disappointing him a lot. Hope Sonny migrate to bigger club next year!!
To be honest, I respect Tottenham but they don’t deserve Son .. you have top scorer last year give him everything he wants!! Shame on you Tottenham 😂😂
never in doubt
son 👍👍👍👍👍
I think this describes Premier League..Tottenham can even beat Sporting in champions league..in PL scores 6 goals..😄😄😄
"He is back"
응 3-5-2 로 가자.
Son-a tunlai i dam tha maw,iva vang ve🤭🤭
fucking chicken
I love son!!!
나도 의심한 적 없다. 손흥민
extended highlights where?
쌉인정
It's happened a lot.... Kane randomly passes the ball to Son. Son scores an amazing goal Kane has an assist
Wtf… son🤘🏿
Please make the highlights longer. Just like skysports does with champions league
That's why he is not for sale 🤪🤪 We can Sale the club to a new owner but not Son to another club.
손흥민은 이적할거다 이 지긋지긋한 정신상태 졸라 삼류인 팀을 떠날거다 싸구려 가격에 감언이설로 구워삶아 발목잡은 토트넘 역겹다 손흥민은 대한민국 국가대표 것도 캡틴이다 한국인으로 자랑스런 모습을 보일거다 손흥민은  이 적  한다

son be shooting left and right, with no care 😂
its not about the Hat Trick look at the goals he scored here . wowww what a player he is. nice one sonnyyyy.
You guys don't deserve Son. Send him away, just like you guys said until this game.
the some idiot tottenham's pans ,prove themselves that Tottenham Hotspur are not a good team for Son
콘테는 손이 잘할수 있는 방법을 알면서도 다른 사람들을 위해 희생시켰다. 그러는 동안 욕은 혼자 다 먹었고..제발 토트넘 떠나자!
Heung-Min Son Now, let's transfer to a club with trust. Let's transfer from Tottenham, where there is betrayal and discrimination.
돌아오는 이적시장에서 빅팀으로 떠나자. 전술만 맞으면 어디서든 득점왕 할 수 있다.
From reading the comments it’s clear Tottenham has no fans.
Barry Kane best player
Must respect son because of him people come to know spur
Perhaps Harry should have been on the bench?
Very proud of him!!

모든 선수님들 고생하셨어요 관중석에 모우라 선수님도 반가웠어요 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️👍💖
최고다 손흥민 👍역시 우리 보물 우리 자랑 우리 월클 늘 행축만 해요. 항상 응원합니다. 그동안 이상한 소리 한 니들 다🤫닥쳐
SON is built different😂😂
Bro son scored initial 2 goals with such confidence and out of the box as if he's doing a Tap In.
Those longshots from son were just perfect
Good Good Good 👍
Say sorry to Son
Son’s first goal is a banger
Owen Hargreaves is correct.  Son will remember the slight. He had 3 years left on his contract at Leverkusen. But he forced the club to let him go to Tottenham because he felt slighted... for the same reasons he feels slighted this year... the first guy substituted in most games. He said this summer that his most memorable game was when Korea beat Germany 2-0 at the World Cup in Russia. Do you know why? Because he felt slighted by the German clubs and fans when he was in the Bundesliga. He holds grudges for a long time.
never in doubt Sonny. He is one of the world's best striker
What a playaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
support our womens team too done so well alreday n pretty new well done
Selfish 3rd goal from son....
영어, 한국어 뭐로 써야해? Anyway it was outstanding goal ever seen, futhermore it is meaningful one because he got after severe goal drought in this season. Also all my fuckers, let's live it up day!!
Never in doubt Soniper~!!
Lloris best kiper in teh word in tonight
손흥민을 담기엔 토트넘이라는 그릇이 너무 작다 벤치 운운했을때 진짜 너무 지긋지긋했음 이제 떠날 시기인듯 솔직히 너무 오래있었지
アジアの希望、孫興民
Perišić is slow but Son is fast.
Sonnn
아스날 부셔 버리자  부탁해
적지않은 월드클래스 선수 중에서도 양발 스킬만큼은 최고인듯
should be  awesome london derby this yr
대단해  한번도 손 너를 의심한적 없었다  넌 스타야
손흥민 짱
arsenal  fans  liking our players lol  ty ty  bit weird but thats  v nice of u
🤟
My son love
Son👏👏
sonny is back
Son = Liverpool  .. the best choice
coys coys
That's why many Spurs fans wanted Son dropped to the bench because he was always going to react this way, in a very positive manner. He gets it! Competition for places, with the likes of Richarlison and Kulusevski (and, to a lesser extent, Gil and Lucas) breathing down his neck for a starting spot. Nobody can afford to slack off, you've got to be on it 100% every week.
Insane!
Amazing son
heung min son love u bro
손흥민이 교체투입 되어서 해트트릭했다는 영국인 토트넘팬들아 손흥민이 교체투입되어서 잘한게 아니고 콘테 전술이 문제였던거다 페리시치하고 그동안 동선이 겹치니까 손흥민의 기량이 제대로 나올수 없던거야..콘테가 생각이 있다면 다음부턴 무조건 3-5-2전술로 가야한다 그리고 영국인들아 한국팬으로서 너네가 정말 밉다 손흥민이 해준게 얼만데 몇경기 부진했다고 손흥민을 욕하냐.너네는 은혜를 모르는 사람들이다
so happy  well done
Please leave. It's not worth sacrificing for this team, you'll be treated better than here, who doesn't respect you. There's a reason this isn't a big club. I feel so sorry for Son Heung-min.
tyty all involved not just players
best era our history since blanchflower
손흥민 선수  항상 응원합니다
love our team go sonny i knew u would score but 3 omg legend harry gonna surpass jimmy soon =o never thought would happen
Son keep going!!!!
Even as a Chelsea fan, I have said it in 2 years that Son is the 2nd best player in PrL.
But this goal keeper
Son always scores classy goals. What an incredible player.
He makes crazy both haters and followers. what a  super star.
내가 뭐라했어 스스로 증명할거라 했지!!!
The Return of the King !!!!
Very best player 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
the legend surprisingly not in PFA Team OF The Year 2021/2022, wtf
손흥민팬이어서 토트넘팬이 되었지만 이젠 토트넘 안티팬이다. 더 이상 호구취급받지말고 이적해. 감사할 줄 모르는  이런 그지같은 클럽에 계속있는 건 아니다. 겨울에 제발 떠나.
Asia's best players but underappreciated compared to European players whose skill is below him
what..........? this game left me speechless after watching Son scoring hattrick inside 13 minutes...
ну чё сказать красавчик сон
After 3-2 Son like -Ok,  we need 3 more xD
last year after 10 games 15 points, this year after 7 games 17 points and first in the table. Antonio, Anto nio, Anto nio, Antonio, Antonio!
Son is back
The assist (header) to kane and son second left foot goal, both felt like breeze🥶
역시 손 ㅋ
i hope he comes to madrid🙂🙂
Sonny was equal with world elite players. So far, he is best Asia player in Europea after Park Ji-sung.
Que jugadorazo es Son, un crack muy infravalorado
So fitting arsenal top of prem  queen funeral as saying our beloved majesty supported arsenal
World class from Son!!!
Lloris is the one who inspired me to become a goalkeeper so seeing him make that first penalty save really made me happy
대부분이 손흥민 칭찬이네
Son its 1 great game and 10 shit
I've never watched Futbol in my life being from Texas its always been US Football, well my brother put me on Tottenham yesterday, No later than 2 minutes after I turned on the TV Son scored his first and as I continued to watch he scored two more. My brother said I should watch more games hahaha!
The super sooon
Dat my Son
Best sony
손흥민 멋지다🎉🎉❤
SONNY Move to another team that recognizes your worth.  52 million Koreans in rich advanced countries are cheering for you.
左右脚均衡
Tottenham fans betrayed son  a fan without respect 🤫 I want you to move to the big club
손흥민 최고 자랑스럽다ㅠㅠ👍👏👏👏
Heung- Min 😭⚽⚽⚽  🇰🇷 🤍💙
Son is refreshing to watch... Manchester United 🔴🇧🇼
Am a true Chelsea fans💙 but I must say Son is a real gem💎🔥🔥🔥,he can use both right and left foot perfectly What a player!!!!!!!👏👏👏
TOTTENHAM COME TO CONQUER
Son silenced the haters🤫🤫🥶🥶
What a Son 🔥🔥
의리 없는 영국인들 ~~~  너희, 냄비들이냐~ 손흥민 갖고 놀지 말어~   우리 한국인들 대부분 상처받았어. 우리는 한번 삐지면 되돌리기 오래걸려. 사람이 살다보면 이럴때도 있고 저럴때도 있지~~~ 손흥민을 그리 괴롭히는겨~  이 싸가지 없는 ㅇㅇㅇ~   흥민이 최고일 때, 싸잊은겨.   신의없는 영국인들 ~~~
You don't deserve him on your team. You have been treating him like crap and many fans are asking for his transfer. So yeah, time for him to be in a better team.
Son is so much capable. What’s he doing in tottenham 😂
Son is the best player😁😁😁
Right, left, and again right foot Son, he's an amazing footballer
Man of the match, 1 Bentancur 2 Sony
not a tottenham fan, but this guy is really amazing, his left and right foot are crazy, Conte should give extra credit for him
Son is back
손흥민 ⚽⚽⚽👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
SONY Kebanggaan Asia
Antonio Conte top manager
World- class all day long!
이딴 팀에 희생하지 말고 떠나자 제발 ㅜㅜ 어딜 가도 그지같은 여기보단 대우 잘 받을 수 있다. 여긴 팬이나 팀기자나 구단이나 빅클럽 못 되는 이유가 있음. 손흥민이 있기엔 그릇이 간장종지 보다도 못하다
ㅅㅂ손흥민 해트트릭까지하고 저렇게 표정 안좋은거 처음 보는듯..?아니 원래 지난시즌 득점왕인 팀에이스가 미끼롤로만 쓰이고 공 도 못받고 그러면 왜 그렇게 쓰냐고 화내는게 아니라 누가 근본없는 팀 아니랄까봐 또 시즌 시작하고 2~3경기만에 일부러 벤치 여론 만들고 우르르 휩쓸렸다가 또 우르르 태세전환해서 찬양하는거 존나ㅅㅂㅋㅋ팀 에이스 벤치라고 좋아하던 현지팬들은 진짜...주제를 모르는건가..진짜 토트넘 경기력에 만족하는건가..? 손흥민이 진짜 토트넘에 끝까지 있을거라고 생각하는건가...? 이딴식으로 쓸꺼면 우리 팀 달라는 타팀팬들보면 존나 배가부른거같음 챔스가니까
Showing the world why he truly deserves the 89 rating on FIFA. Son's one of the best of our generation.
Super SON
한국인 국뽕.. 가슴이 웅장해진다.. He is a south korean.
Son the biggest Asian player in the world
손흥민 선수 대한민국은 당신을 응윈 합니다 같이 아파하고 같이 슬퍼하고 같이 기뻐합니다 대한민국이 등뒤에서 든든히 받치고 있으니 즐겁게 축구 해요🙏
He's back!
Man u should be going for players like Son..love him
페르시치 빼라 손흥민 굿 페르시치 아웃
From the start, Sonny no longer had to prove his performance. However, the British press and Spurs fans were as fickle as a teenage girl, constantly blaming the results of the first few matches. I think Sonny likes this club, but now I expect him to start thinking differently.
This channel should have a separate like button called Son so that I can like it, he's sooo good and underated smh
Never rule out Son.
last goal looked offside
Y'all produce the most boring highlights
He is back.. Son.. But man of the match Bentacour n Hojbjerg..
대 버 지
Son turns live soccer to PES 22
out an bad like dat, now cage his ass up and dont let him out till next cl fix
I.m telling son ajti don t doubt son again 👅

Son is incredible! People who criticize him are idiots 🙄
Sonaldo✔ Sonaldinho ✔ 😂😂😂😂😂
손흥민의 부활 👍👍👍👏👏👏
Son is the best of the best in EPL and also liked by Liverpool and Arsenal fans as a Tottenham player.
Son's shots are stuck on RT. Damn
Guess who's back, back again  Sonny's back!! 😍
Son is back !
토트넘은 케인과 손흥민을 가지기엔  많이 부족한 팀입니다  고마움은 커녕 손흥민을 깐다구요? 토트넘 현지 팬들은 분수를 아세요
쏘니에게 볼을 줘봐 골을 만들어 낼테니 !!!
Heung Min Son is back he scores very beautiful and strong there is a scorer that is back full of power Hat-Trick 3
World class Son doesn't die easily either
손흥민을 의심하지 마라
1:44 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
a hat-trick with dream all goals.
Son is back!!!!!!
sonnyyyyyyy!!
Son has been overlooked by the biggest clubs. This dude has been doing this year in year out
son. 이적하세요. 적어도 이적 발언하면 토트넘보다는 나은 팀에 갈 수 있어요. 몇 경기 골 없고 안 좋다고 완전히 선수 무시하고, 인종차별에 정말 미개하고 어리석은 영국인들과 언론들 치가 떨리네요. 거기다 약아빠진 콘테까지. 이적하는게 정답.
손흥민이 돌아왔구나?!
The problem is that if sonny continue to play with Perisic in the future, it will be difficult for Sonny to show such a play.   Perisic is only a cross-cross-cross style, so the Sonny advantages of penetration, line breaking, cutback and middle shot are lost. Conte wingback,Cross Lover Perisic will start and Sonny will be replaced in many games.   It would be better for Sonny to move to a big club (Liverpool) that suits him.
back  with 3 goals
Son is not tired  Conte should understand it💪🏾
처음에 왜 PK 다시 찬거에요??
Son is indeed a better player than Mbappe or Haaland in my opinion.Very underrated
It was the wrong formation and tactics!! Not a problem with Son!!! I hope Conte learnt a big lesson from this match! 2 top Harry and Son is the only way not 3 top form
Арсенал победит
Pemain sepakbola tanpa haters, itulah son 😀
Wow son left and right  what a goal 👏 😳
FACT: The main reason Son left Leverkusen was because he was the first to be replaced. In other words, Son and his people are very sensitive about playing time.
Son best winger :)
Son Left foot or right foot ⚽⚽⚽
SONALDO
mengerikan tsunami goal
Form is temporary, class is permanent. Son has always been top class even when not scoring recently.
So happy for this guy!
TODAY'S SONNY BOOM 💥
👏👏👏👏
Amazing son
Son......here you go ..... Those goals are classic hatrick
다 뽀록이네
Let`s Go!!!  Sony!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
go son!
Son keren
Son leave Tottenham.
After the match, Son Heung-min said, "The team performance at the beginning of the season was good, but 'I' was not happy personally because I had a difficult time. “I was disappointed and frustrated,” and "There wasn't much I could do with Tottenham's changed playstyle this season."  Clearly an unhappy sign, uh? never saw this strong opinion from him. He is just frustrated with Conte's bad, bad tactics and we also know it's really poor. Spurs suddenly became Heading goal FC with fucking performance.
Сон - дьявол
Good job SON7
Sons Great Players...Nice One 💙❤
HMS7🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those guys who said we should drop Sonny are STUPID.
토트넘에 있으면 절대! 우승하지 못한다 손흥민 이적해야한다!
MANTAP TOTTENHAM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a performance COYS ❤
When Harry Kane was off his form,  how come he wasn't put on the bench? But Son is singled out for the team's poor performance.  Can they do that to Kane ?
He is back...
The most underrated player in Europe is son
Wow I wish the highlights would’ve been way shorter than this. Can you make it one minute long?
Bentacur
Son, most underrated player in the world!
Ho cheng pang sheng
Son is a legend.. no debate
What a son
He had a lot of haters but the truth is Spurs will never contend for much if Son isnt back to his usual form.
From Singapore with respect to Son !!!!!!
Son is Back
There are very few players better at scoring outside the 18 yeard box than Son. He may be up there all alone in that category!!!
Shut the fxxx up haters. You’re not spurs fan.
Son 🤝🏻 finess shots
손흥민 만세!
The player that everyone waiting for his first goal new season Son
아쉽다 처음부터 리버풀에서 뛰었다면 좋았을텐데...
Let's be honest, he was going to break out of his slump sooner than later. All world class players do.
SON BEST OUT OF THE BOX SCORER IN THE WORLD. BEST FORWARD  FROM A MAN UNITED FAN
son make it look so easy 😆
Son is not badminton player
Phenomenal 💡
Son 🐐🐐🐐
I love this player oh boy !
Son 🔥🔥🔥

Leicester otw relegation
I want to see Sonny play under Klopp's leadership.😳
Son is back
Can't wait for the man city meeting with tottenham i think haaland can only act a little
Son Son Son 💯🔥
손선수 너무 맘고생 많았어요 💙
Wtf brooo, son?
He scored loads of screamers against top teams in PL and CL. He saved Tottenham singlehandedly numerous time. He won the golden boot without a single penalty. He won the The FIFA Puskás Award . He scored wonder goals with both feet numerous time. He have been consistent for the past couple years. Yet some white people still doubt his ability..... Honestly what do you guys still want from him?Save the universe?SON is the gem which every single football club craves for on this planet,give him the credits he deserves Geeees
Son Hueng Min The Korean King He plays for Tottenham on the wing He got his medal without going to war Left foot,right foot,no matter as long as he scores!! Sonaldo Sonperion Son Heung Messi!! Only Expressions Ozzing can say it right,but Big Up Sonny!!
보고 또 봐도 질리지 않넹♡ 올 시즌 시작해서 제일 재미있었던 경기♡ Son 쵝오다^^
It s  just crazy thing. He has been literally  improving every year since he came Spurs. He get 30 years old soon, but i feel like he will even more improve next year.
the game seen yesterday can be a winner against the last in the standings (who ruled the game for a long time yesterday, with LLoris among the best in the field) and against some team that is too unbalanced in attack; in the middle there are hundreds (also in Europe) of teams that do not unbalance and do not close and with those, the game seen yesterday, almost always fails. - Better that Conte wake up, because he must not forget that he has one of the strongest offensive teams in the world
his weak foot is never talked about enough, he scored from outside the box with that left foot on so many occasions. But maybe sometimes he is also inconsistent.
Score a goal like this against a strong team.  otherwise it makes no sense son.
Thos guy is a highclass player but os underated
Son's hatrick was disgusting!
Best Son!
Glory Tottenham ♥️♥️♥️♥️
You can't hate Son🥺⚽😭♥️
😍🔥
I’m a Liverpool fan, but that was a great performance by Son. He’d be welcome to join the Reds. YNWA 🔴
Spurs dnt deserver son.
I hope this cat leaves to another club where he gets the respect he deserves.
괜찮아 어디 클럽이든 이적하면 돼~ 손흥민 지켜 본 사람이면 누구든 얘가 무엇보다 팀을 우선시했다는 걸 알거다 이제 나가서 행복축구 하면 돼
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"It's Kane." absolutely with Son. Perfect story making history!!!
손흥민 굉장하다.
Wow😮
Brilliant result for us we are picking up points before this match and we’ve not been at our best we still have away to go so happy for son today he is a class act in Conte we trust cmon you spurs 🤜🏻
Best of the best, Son Heung Min!  When he didn't score for a few matches, pundits started to doubt him, fans started to blame him, and everyone else started to dismiss him.  "Form is Temporary, Class is Permanent."  Son Heung Min is World-Class.
Sonny, it's time to leave this fuxxing club. Sonny u should say goodbye to stupid Tottenham fans. They always blame and make him depressed for just few weak performance but not to Kane  it is so ridiculous attitude like racism... so ashamed of UK  Sonny u don't need to play for them  anymore  they don't deserve to watch ur performance  pls transfer to other clubs.
Son and Kane these two never cease to surprise me
Arsenal fan but fucking love this player
Son you are the greatest asian player and one of the greatest player all over the world
I’m a gunner but Son is my fav Spurs player of all time. #Sonaldo
for the love of god a better team PLEASE sign this guy already
son 3 shot, 3 goal
Son is the best Asian player without any doubt
Sons back 🔥
Сон легенда Тоттенхэма, надеюсь возьмем трофей в этом сезоне
I never doubted him for one second 😭
Good job my son
콘테가 흥민이를 망치고있다  전술잘써라  히송패치를 쓰지말고
Son, pls leave Spurs and go where you can play happy. Conte's tactic does not suit you well. You are just an expendable for Kane in this team and not many fans appreciate what you have done for this club. Liverpool may be good for you because you do not have to go deep for defence.
Now that is a player.
Think its time for Rogers to leave 2nd manager to lose his job after that 6 to 2
Son isn't back, he's never been away😎
right foot left foot what a fantastic goal..❤❤❤❤
Form is temporary, class is permanent.  Get in Sonnie!

흥민아 제발 이적해 여기선 컵 절대 못들어
Son is last season EPL golden boot! But this season sub???? Why??
The spell of goal drought ended by this 13-minute hat-trick only deepens the Legend of the Son ⚽️⚽️⚽️🎩
What a performance of song hung min

Son to Liverpool... Very soon.
I honestly get goosebumps when watching Son. Two world class goals, one with the right foot and one with the left. Not many players out there that can do that.  Also, shout out to Bentancur - incredible work in midfield.
🇰🇷Art is the salt of life.
손흥민 선수가 내달릴 때 가슴이 벅차오르고, 골을 넣을때 엄청난 희열감이 찾아옵니다. 나의 스타여, 많은 사람들을 놀래켜주세요.
After the hat-trick Son could have said that he wanted to shut the doubters or something like that.  That's what a lot of star footballers would have said.  But he didn't.  He said that he was sorry for not performing up to the level that this teammates and fans deserved.  So he apologized instead of being bitter towards Tottenham fans who doubted him.  What a show of character!
I am a liverpool fan but i love this back to score with intelligent from sonny, keep it going soony you are amazing
Sonny's football story is really crazy.
Its disgusting those few Spurs fan who wanted to throw Sonny under thes. You all are disgraceful and never should be a Spurs fan. For Sonny not to smile shows his hurt to those pigs . Well done Sonny 99% of Tottenham never stopped believing in you. Smile for us
Sayang nya son bukan orang erofa. Coba kalo orang erofa pasti jadi bintang sepak bola.
il be waiting for conte cam
The power of goll bestt son💪
Legend!!! He's back. Never doubt SON!!!!!
antoniooo
Sonaldo💟
Conte, no more unnecessary experiment pls. Give Son a space and he will sure score. 3-5-2 formation is the best for Spurs because Spurs midfilders are not that strong. Use Bisumar, he is physically good. Son, Kane two top and Bentan, Bisu, Hoya at middle and Peri, Klub at wings. Hisha can make a substitute for either Son or Kane. Sese for Peri. With this Spurs will seldom lose.
Son is the best player in world like Messi, Christiano Ronaldo
Andrew Tate is a great motivator!
He is back
Son is underrated.. The guy deserves the praise 🔥
This is his 3rd premier league hat trick tied with Christiano Ronaldo
I hope that Conte can teach him to play when the oppositions are defending deep and tight as well
Just listen and see stupid England. That is korean king. That is Asia's majesty. And now he will prove it. Always he did.
Tottenham will never have  a great and special player like son .He never disappoint ,he makes football very much easy
3 Surprise goals from Sonny. I guess he released his shots into Conte’s girl?!   That is why Sonny is faster! Lol!!
son really used both legs like nothing. what a talented man 😮‍💨
2 Times son make a great goals
Son have a bad start but so glad to see him hit the ground running
Crazy crazy.  Hotspurs!
Transfer team, stay at Tottenham and can't challenge the Champions League
SON
SON!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Look his face, and dont forget it, who took the team to champions league
son is world class
Son is legend!
Truly sonaldo!!
I wish Son goes to Old Trafford on loan til the end of the season...we dont have a player like him.
Songoal
Sonny said "Even if there are people who doubt me, I never doubt myself."
He is One of The Goat the media just fail to recognize him#
What a goal
Son no counter
This is worrisome after watching Son's performance...he finally is getting is rhythm back... Tottenham looking so damn solid overall.... 😢
Son fighting
When the floodgate was opened! That's what we saw Sonny's performance today.
Son Heung min is the most perfect player.  Let's not doubt Son anymore!!  Son is legend.....
Holy shit, these longshots are crazy, Son!!!
KANE is so selfish with the ball these season . Son showing him how its done. You can't score in every game just pass the ball and goals will come
If Tottenham fans boos and disrespect SON just because he is not in form ,he must leave the Club. After giving so much for the Club and scoring many goals in the past seasons,its disrespect to him if the fans mistreat/Boos/chant  him.
It’s Kane, It’s Son, it’s Leicester. It always happens.
2:01 Worldclass player
Son is the best 2 footed footballer on the planet
I am an Arsenal guy through and through but you just cannot dislike this guy. Son is a great lad and deserves all the respect and praise he is getting tonight.
mantap Spurs
son is suitable bench
Perisic is THE man for crosses!
Harry Kane best striker ❤️
Leicester keeper though
How many times do he has to prove that Sonny is a world class player?  You Brits are just narrow-minded.  When Kane couldn't do it last August, the British kept cheering him on.  Sonny will move to another team after this season.  Sony's failure to score so far is also due to coach CONTE's tactics.  You Brits won't be able to blame Sony for moving to another team one day.  Sonny, let's move to a bigger team after this season.
Its son Korean's best footballer
Hugo Lloris.. This guy always prays for Son's fail so probably he can't sleep well  last night
Foxes getting smacked "left" and "right" by HM Goat
This season Son will get three hat tricks more.
don't underestimate our Son💪
アジア人の域超えてる
Everyone is beating Leicester no big deal here🙂🙂 🔴⚪️
If my son see it
Superb player.. Sonderful 😍👍
Super Son
이제 시작이다~~~.
흥민아 우리팀으로 와라💙
Son is a destroy player, Ghana watch out.🔥🔥🔥🔥😂🤣🤣
The best Asian Player
amazing!!!son!!!!
What a player
Son scoring 3 goals in 13 minutes has to be the closest to Lewa's 5 goals in 9 minutes ( oh shoot i forgot mané )
손흥민의 헤트트릭 부활이 팬들에게 확실한 충격을 줬나보네 ㅋㅋ 토트넘유튜브 조회수 죄다 10만아래로 깔짝거렸는데 이번영상 조회수 11시간만에 약 300만
Son 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Сон кумысом заряжается перед каждым матчем))) Просто огонь)))
Well done Sonny💙
Son or kane              👇
Absolutely world class. So determined and persevering. Son is a football legend. It will be a great shame and Spurs' immense loss if they let him go.
슈팅 궤적 ㅎㄷㄷ하네
Just wonderful the first and the second by Son🥶😱
손흥민 흥해라
Son is legend
Why the sign of your beast.
Trust Sonny 👍👍
Son was on Fifa legendary mode
Average performance by Son, Ghana shall beat South Korea mercilessly at Qatar 2022.
감독픽 신입 영입생 띄우겠다고 전 시즌 득점왕에 챔스 멱살 끌어올려준 팀에이스를 신입스쿼드 따까리로 쓰는 게 말이 되냐ㅋㅋ 진짜 내년만큼은 이적해야됨  이 개노답 팀에 너무 오래 헌신해버렸다
Up the Spurs
SON MVP
352!!!!!
아니지 아니지... 너네가 왜 좋아하냐 그냥 두어번 더 벤치 보내자 그럼 빼도박도 못하게 언해피 이적각임
Happy for sonny
sebagus apapun son dia tidak akan pernah dapat gelar pemain terbaik FIFA, dan untuk menghindari kecurigaan warga dunia terhadap FIFA mengenai rasime maka puskas cukup utk pemain asian tdk lebih tidak kurang, hehehe jargon FIFA say no to racism itu kebohongan semata
Tottenham neden sari kart görmüyor. Biraz tuhaf penalti oluyor sari kart gostermiyor
he is back !!! magnificient 7
SON should be in a barcelona , real madrid or man city. Those big club for him as he didn’t win anything with spurs 😢
Son needs more supply… ✨
FARMERS LEAGUE!!!
Gorgeous
Son....💥
손흥민 선수 언제나 응원합니다💙
SON THE AMAZING!! What a playa!!
Keyn legends
Son is the best wing in the world.....INCREDIBLE🔥🤯left foot right foot...
Son is crazy bruh..
사람이 침체기가 있는 거지?   선발에서 제외 하라는 놈들 어떤 놀들이야 엉~ 불구 나무서서 손들고 대가리 박고 반성 해라 ~ 어떤 놈들은 다른 팀에 팔라고 하는 사람들도 있는 것 같은데 ㅋㅋ 나원 참 ~ 좀 기다려 줄줄 알아라 ` 골 킬러는 언젠가 터지는 한방이 있는 거다.
손흥민선수와 케인선수는 더 큰 클럽으로  가야한다 작년에 챔피언스 리그로 끌어올린 선수가 누구인지  잊어선 안된다
히즈 백 오우 ㅋㅋ
Son unbelievable!
눈물난다ㅜㅜ
https://youtu.be/EAsXT__YUEA
He is back...
I was watching the game in a corporate box, it was a phenomenal game
ini adalah awal kehancuran chelsea dan Manchester united
because God loved the world so much that he gave his only son Jesus Christ for all mankind so that any man who believes in Jesus Christ may inherit eternal life through him if we confess our sins Jesus Christ is faithful and just to forgive us and only through Jesus can we inherit eternal life32
Feel sorry for bredan Roger's. Looks like he's out.
Join real madrid is far better for u, son!
Soooooon
Sonny should move either to Chelsea or Man United .. He will definitely shine there
I think he's the only guy every football fan loves regardless of their clubs of choice. Wish You come at United and enjoy
Damn son’s goal we’re insane, those long shots, damn
Watching all frustrating reactions of England Tottenham fans and reporters this season, I'm sure he should leave this club and he will. This small club just doesn't deserve this humble, loyal, skillful and absolute star player.
What a players son is!
super! sony!!
아 분위기 훈훈해지니까 왜 불안하지 그냥 올해 쭉 언해피 각 세워서 내년에 이적 좀 하자.... 제발 탈트넘
need the extended highlight pls
My man scored twice with long range effort.. the second goal was pure outrageous give me goosebump!! SONSATIONAL❤
챔스 상위권진출을 위해서 전술352와 343을 번갈아가며 사용해야한다. 343일때 페리시치의 크로스에 케인과 히샬리르송은 웃지만 손흥민은 침묵한다. 352일때는 손케조합의 극효율을 높여준다. 단. 페리시치와 손흥민은 공존할수없다. 오늘 콘테 인터뷰를 통해서 선수들을 로테이션돌리며 잘 활용할것이라는 확신을 가졌다.
MAN of THE MATCH!! You are AWESOME SON.    _SARANGHAEYO!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Hope Son transfers to a different team next year.....
So...where were the haters when Kane didn't score last season?
Bet kasper would have saved some of them
Pride of Korea.
son is selfish though lol, that first goal hehe
필요없다 그냥 이적하자  이번이 처음도 아니고  하다 못해 패럿 쓰고 손흥민 벤치 보내라고  하던게 토트넘 팬들임  그리고 토트넘 자체가 지긋지긋 함 무관지옥
He never left my FPL team!
Conte's tactics  is just so bad, awful performance & header goals only..... it will collapse soon. The hat-trick of Hm Son in 13 minutes - all field goals&wonder goals- is the most joyful to watch out of all games of Spurs this season, to be honest. It is a "Foot' ball. What Conte is doing now is not a football, just crazy in collecting his own points.
still underated, little monster SONY🔥
alah... ayam sayur, pertngahan musim juga melorot dia
다이어도 수비수지만 조금씩 골 터져주니까 좋다 다들 잘하고 있어
Son is underated.
🫶🫶🫶
Waiting for the Conte Cam from last night’s game 😊
Bu maç bana okulda futbol turnuvasındaki maçı hatırlattı
Son is beast
What are Haters doing now?
Sonaldo 🖤
"He is Korean"
After haland the other guy am afraid of is son. This two can score at anytime at any condition
PASTI BANYAK YG LANGSUNG KE KOCI, GIMANA SON NIH MENURUT COACH JUSTIN? DIAJARIN NGE GOLIN PAKEK KAKI KANAN DAN KIRI TUH WKKW PALING ALASANNYA KARNA MUSUH BAPUK DAN LAWAN LEICESTER
Conte reduced the number of attacks from three to two. We're winning.It's a defensive reinforcement. But Son Heung-min scored 3 goals! It is a very economical tactic. It is a tactic that ends if you send the ball to Son Heung-min unconditionally. This is it. Tottenham's Conte is this!! It is possible because it is Son Heung-min.
Højbjerg is such a keyplayer for u
Fantastic ...
손은  마법사
min son cadaaasss anjeerr
HER NAME IS SONNY FROM S . KOREA
Shame on all English fans who have been abusing Son after he drove the team individually to champions league last season Shame on you all  You should learn to appreciate atleast With his demand on the market He chose to stay and still some of you could not atleast be grateful for once
Son 흥민~! 그가 진짜 돌아왔다. 이제부터 시작이다.
He is back with three!
The spectacular Son  My best in the league
MAN TOP ❤️
Perfecto! COYS!!!
Na zook up
Son go kong
Where are the haters now?
Nothing feels better than to watch Leicester lose even more fun than watching Everton/M.UTD lose
We missed you Son!
I realy dont understand why is he being booed by some racist spurs fan. What a slap Sony!! Congratulation !!
토트넘은 손흥민을 버리세요 손흥민을 제발 이적시키세요 손흥민은 토트넘과 맞지않습니다 손흥민을 존중하지 않는 토트넘은 그를 팔아 차라리 돈을 버세요 토트넘팬도 보드진도 손흥민을 향한 존중은 전혀 보이지않습니다 그들은 오직 콘테와 케인만 존중합니다 손흥민은 그저 호구취급합니다 7년간의 노력이 전혀 존중받지못하는 건 옳지않습니다 토트넘은 그냥 그를 이적시키고 돈이나 버세요 콘테에게 손흥민은 필요하지 않습니다
My son is back❤
I don't know why clubs don't make offers for Son
Hujan gol
I checkout spurs matches just to watch son play.What a player
Son 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵🥵🥵
disgusting conte & you spurs!!!! never in doubt??? fxxk off!!! you guys always in doubt!!! even no respect this season!!! sonny they are not your fans & team at all!!! plz move away from spurs!!!
So happy for him 😁😁😁😁. Definitely back and with a hat-trick 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Beautiful goals.
손 흥민 왕의 귀환을 축하한다..주말이 행복해~
Son the best player .het trik
Bentacur scored a superb goal. 👏🔥
I am an Arsenal fan..this guy SON gives me sleepless nights.. I hope we beat Spurs.. Twice. Wont be easy though, they are probably the Top 3 toughest EPL teams currently    But SON  is good! Lets buy him!!? 😁
you just cant tell if sons right or left footed,amazing player
Leicester works wonders without Caglar Soyuncu :D
Spurs fans are are the worst. Booing such an amazing footballer, he showed today that the fans don't deserve him.
Get in there sonny, you beauty!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whoever hated on heung min son because he had a poor start need to shut up, doesn't mo salah have 2 league goals.
Son🔥
孙哥，牛逼！ Kane, let Sonny get the free kick chances…try..
Both 2 Golden Boots player are not having a smooth start this season. M.Salah is hard to score as well... This match show Son's still maintain high level and class! Hat trick in such short time! Real genius!
The noise of the fans when he scored that first one was incredible
어제까지만 해도 다 욕하더니 다 어디갔냐 ㅋㅋ
Son going crazy after 6weeks no goal, damn!
손민흥 파이팅!!!
What a shit highlights ffs
Son.....!!!
One & Only !
Son must be really loved by Tottenham hotspur's fans
Son of a gun
What a treat to watch! 🔥
Son hatrrick 😍
The Asian Ronaldo 😍
Son is the best, first, everlast. my hero!! now is time for your smile. thank you sonny 💙
Congratulations, Son, you scored a hat-trick ❤️✌️
seandainya maen di MU hehe
Son is the best asian player ive ever seen..
Son is up and running
It was true son did need a rest and everyone could see it but benching him was the best possible thing that could’ve happened to him! He come on that pitch needing to prove a point and he did just that👏🏽 never in doubt 🔥COYS
손흥민 언제나 응원합니다
Son❤️❤️❤️
Son's second goal was his trademark
Sometimes fans are the greatest haters/bashers as well......Disappointing/hurting there idols......a bad thing
Perhaps it will be the last time this season that he will play for this team. He said in a Korean interview that he is not happy now.😭
the fact that son used his right then his left for both those goals is incredible..... what a player holy sh$*
What a goal by son!! This man is on fire!
*Stephen Sonny* back with the 3point shoots
Cmon guys. Its only the premier league. Frankfurt will win and show how overrated the PL is
Ganti pelatih nya,mas pemain sehebat son di cadangkan
Son is back🔥
Son did great job 👍 Really great, but don't forget about Bentancur's first Spurs goal, one assist and some good moments. Few mistakes also, but generally good game 👏
Son turning into prime Ronaldo distant goals🔥🔥🔥no wonder they share #7
교체로 나오니 잘하네
The King is back.  Never doubt idiots.
Bentancur is class!
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!
Son showing why form is temporary but class is permanent.
다시는 손흥민을 의심하지 마라
SON IS BACK
손흥민 자랑스러워요ㅁ
He's back!. So surreal.
지난시즌 득점왕 13분만에 해트트릭하는 팀에이스를 벤치에 박아놓고 경기를 시작한다고..토트넘이? 암튼 존나 답답하게 경기하는데 나오자마자 멋있게 필드골 연속으로 넣어버리까 존나 속시원함ㅋㅋ 공 도 못받고 미끼롤로 쓰이다가 힘 다 빠지고 욕 먹고  교체당하는것보다 차라리 교체되서 나오는게 나은가 싶을정도임ㅅㅂㅋㅋ
Its about time Son move to a more trophy environment club. He done so much for spurs yet he still under appreciated. Park ji sung was right, Son is good but not in a good club.
Can someone please explain why the penalty was reawarded?
Son shots always gives me goosebumps 🔥
Sonny should leave this club
역시 손흥민  멋있다
Son is just a legend 😩🔥🔥🔥🔥
너네들은 손흥민을 존중할 필요가 있다. 손흥민이 팀을 위해 헌신한 세월이 몇년인데 몇 경기 못한다고 등을 돌리는건 진정한 팬이라고 할 수 없다
Where is Leicester city Goals??????
Son to me can never be replaced he is a club legend and as a person what he bring to the club is more than a smile  More goals to come
sonny is back
Sanchez > maguire
Son looks unhappy. Spurs made Sonny unhappy.
Why did the penalty have to be retaken?
Most underrated player in the Premier League
Hugely underrated player! As a UTD fan i love Son!
킬패트릭 어딨냐 머더뻐커야
Mr Son should be Hottenham Hotspur new Captain or FC Bayern will buy him as soon as possible.
Son you are So so cool have realised it👍👍👍👋
우리 흥민이 너무 너무 멋지다 nice one sonny nice one son~~~~~
Sporting the best! Spurs sucks
Conte is turning THS INTO A MONSTER
Казах рулит
Son is pride of Asia! Love from India 🇮🇳
It was a movie, right? Was it real? The son standing still after scoring the first goal looks like a still picture and the light of glory. I can see the aura, but it was more like a movie than a movie@@^~^*
so humble and modest
Cái cách trở lại của Son mới cảm xúc lầ mf sao . Ghi 3 bàn bằng 2 chân,  sút gần sút xa và đến bàn thứ 3 vẫn ăn mừng nhẹ nhàng tình cảm . Không như ai kia hay còn gọi là 7 đỹ - ăn hôi được 1 quả PEN ( Bruno nó  bố thí cho ) thì lại nhảy lên vung 2 tay mồm kêu gàu gàu - cứ như siêu phẩm ngàn năm có một ( 7 đỹ đá trung phong chỉ ăn bám đ đ  mà sau 14 trận mới ghi được 1 bàn từ HÔI PEN Đ Đ và sau 3 năm 4 tháng 7 đỹ vẫn chưa lừa bóng qua được 1 ai . Giờ đây lũ cuồng 7 đỹ chúng lại ăn bám quá khứ ( cũng như cách mà 7 đỹ ăn bám real hùng mạnh  - từ lúc 7 đỹ rời  real thì BV là của MORIC MESSI BENZEMA ... 😁😁😁😁😁😁
Son❤️
He is back...
Leicester are shit
Son is The most underrated player in the world 🥲🥲🥲
Bikin Adem https://youtu.be/a_1CX5iKz2Q
Spurs don't deserve Son. Time to move on.
Son is really underestimated still. I can't believe he is still at Spurs. No offense.
와우
Leicester need a goalkeeper.
Sonaldo Nazario
* 자랑스럽다~~~ 대한민국의 아들.!!! ㅡ 앞으로 전진만이 있을 뿐 이다.
Bentnacur is absolutely a world class midfielder, he deserves some credit.
Son Goku has done it again!!!
Gilaa
I missed that mid- range goal from Sonny!
Yes Sonny!!!!
1:54  업사이드라 판정 해도 할말 없겟다.  패스 순간에 son 이 20 Cm 정도 앞섯네
He is better than haland he is not only tappin 😬😬😁
Sonny is attacker.. is not defender
If hotspur guys want him to leave, plz let him go this year. He deserves to be play soccer with pleasure.
WTH was Son doing on bench?
Sonny is just ridiculous. What an absolute beast of a player .
Nice son❤
후반 벤탕쿠르 뭐야 ㅋㅋㅋ 갑자기 각성하네
Sonnn,amazing
동료들의 진심어린 축하와 위로는 쏘니의 골만큼 기쁘고 안심되는 모습이었습니다ㆍ 토트넘 선수들  케인 다이어 호이비에르 쎄쎄뇽 히샬리송 벤탕쿠르 로메로 쎕쎕이 랑글레 비수마 페르시치 에메르송 산체스 요리스  모두모두 정말 고맙습니다ㆍ 토트넘 선수들의 동료애 멋지고 훌룡했습니다ㆍ 감동입니다ㆍ 선수에서 은퇴하시게 된 그 훗날까지도 축구로 행복했던  우정과 추억이  영원히 기억되길 ~~
In love with Son's lethal strike🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conte has been trying different tactics after new players joined the team. Son started this season with a little off form and struggled to adjust himself in this new formation. looks like we finally found the solution to make the combination to the best or close to it. it was just a process to improve the team to the next level. Don't be impatient and support them and we will see some great results at the end.
i'm proud to be a south korean sonny is backkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
The goals of son was like North korean nuclear
Coming from an Arsenal fan about SON… what a player. Would love to see him go to Real Madrid.
흥민아 해트트릭 축하해! 하지만 이적하는게 답이다.
son reminds me of bale…. what a player…
Two first goals by Son and one by Maddison are really top class!
Son Son Son......👏👏👏👍👍👍
Impossible and satisfying goals by son.
💙 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️👏👏👏👏💙 COYS 💙😍😁
time to go to milano, son
I was fortunate enough to be there yesterday - one of the best games I’ve ever seen, full of drama and of course Son’s hat trick!  COYS!
첫번째 골은 수비가 병신이거나 방심한 거 두번째 골은 잘 넣은 거 인정 세번째 골은 개씹운빨 이게 팩트다
son is back :D
Son 👏🏼
호이비에르 마지막 패스 케인한테 더 공간이 많았는데 흥민이에게 패스 주는 센스보소 ㅋㅋㅋ
Yet no big offers from big clubs in the world came for him... Some clubs spend big money for useless players....
Son ❤️
이제 떠나자 흥민아 톹 넘에는 최선을 다했으니 홀가분하게 떠나자
This game just reminds me of that 6 2 win against everton a few seasons back, goals galore
Thnx for the fpl points wish i captained him
His long range shot is quality and legit
سوون ابدع ابدع
1:27～ ソンフンミン無双
kenapa son di bangku cadangkan, kenapa gk licarlison ??
역시 손흥민선수
Coach justin sedih melihat son hatrick 😅
He’s backkkkkk
We just need to work on ball retention and passing and we could actually compete
He is back ,back in flames
Super crazy son🤯
oh son ❤️❤️
Wish Son was a united player! 🤣
Son is not back, he never left!
He is back!!!
Sonny is On Fire 😁👍
Ngerti ora son ??? Son best players asia
Son is beast💪💪
Wish he was playing foe England .lol
Lovely goal from Son
Chills. So happy when he got that first goal. The day he was told that he was starting on the BENCH, he scores a HAT TRICK!! Let's GO!! 🔥
Tilemans has been shut this season
Son👍👍👍
the BEST asian player EVER.. period
Сон Хен Мин ❤❤
Face of spurs
Arsenal 👍💪🤩 Hotspur 😆😄🤪😛
Son❤
Ward is so bad, this is basically his fail comp
드디어 골쳐 넣노 ㅋㅋ
제발 이적해!
Lewandowski 5 scores in 9 min ( Bayern/Wolfsburg)
Many were even comparing Richarlison to Son because of what? 2 UCL goals that came from headers?  Oh Lawd, have mercy.  If I were the one, this is simply what I'll do. I'll score enough goals this season and when the stakes are very high, I'll resign.
SON ON FIRE 🔥👌❤️
Can Maguire do the same to his haters? No! He keeps proving them right....well-done Son..top class player
Son💟🌚
Son edan ka asupan maradona 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think we must call him "super sonic" He more than fast, he fantastic
Lewandowski 5 goal in 9 minutes
Gila ya hotspurr. Sikatt son ora son
Conte couter attack is amazing
ok, where are the amazing goal replays?
Ok so is no one gonna mention how bad their goalie was? He is terrible
역시.    손흥민.    잘하네요 👍👍👍👍👍
Unbelievable football from Son,, Wohooooo
Everyone shits on Tottenham, like they didn't take a gamble on a South Korean player who had yet to serve on mandatory military duty, sent him away during a crucial period for Tottenham on hope that he can win the Asia cup, and be exempted.   Also, any big club in Europe, the fans will turn on you if you are not performing. Take Real Madrid, PSG, or Barcelona. Hazard, Bale, Neymar, Coutinho, etc.
he is back~~
Son the class is back
Son is back! Beautiful goals.
He said he only need 1... come out and score hattrick instead, well done Son!
I waited for today Son. 😁😁😁
truly asian pride SON
왼발 오른발 신의발👍🏻
Fun fact: Koreans hate Heung Min Son
😊😊😊
Tottenham = ❤
Against tired defence...that is not special. 2 beautiful goals tho.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmtdutDcSbY&
I believe son has no weak foot  this guy is simply amazing
Son truly scored bangers ⚽💯
Son’s left foot = prime Ronaldo’s left  =Neymars left
son just makes an art in every single game 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Son🔥
Why did the first penalty be disallowed and was retaken?
Heung min son, luar biasa.
Son it s so underrated ..
As an Arsenal fan, Arsenal should be scared of Spurs this season.
I knew he would do this way
Son revived!
You guys still think Son is bad?
GIVE HIM BALLON DOR. Period.
Son with the reduced shot error slider.
Atimes, I regret being a spurs fan. The level of impatience is too much. Same player that almost single-handedly took us to the UCL is being booed, not by outsiders but by his very own just because of some goalless run. And now, they are singing his praises because he has showed up.   Conte, get ready to be booed.  Lloris, get ready.  Bentancur, brace yourself for impact.  Hojberg, get ready.  Richarlison, get ready.  Dier, get ready.  Everyone in this squad, just get ready.   I just can't believe it. It pains me so much!   If anyone at all should loose faith in Son,is it us fans? We can't stand behind him for a couple of goalless runs? Th irony is, the outsiders were strongly behind him and saying 'Son, please come to Liverpool'. Liverpool fans even made a video to tat regard. And Son is seeing all these. That's why he did the hands-on-the-lips celebration.   Son, please you have my permission. Kindly move to another club. You've endured enough. Honestly, we don't deserve you.
손이 돌아왔다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Son
❤❤❤ sonnnyyyy….🎉
son♡
У Лестера на воротах кто то из рпл стоял ?
I always knew son as a wonderful player I am not a Spurs fan but I am fan Heug-min Son
Son is a legend!
Son Son gagalmaningg SonSon
Those two remote goals are diamonds. One with his right and the other with the left. Sensational
He is back
Son come to man United, tot fans betray u
Tottenham for ever
Sonny that was awesome 🤙. I can read from his face that he didn't Blevin it tho.🤭. I want to say thanks for every players it was amazing match 😎
That wasn't even a penalty at the beginning
Sonny💯😭😭😭
Son7 show who he is.....
Stop play ricarlison
Conte is an unbelievable manager.
2:04 yeah, it's me !
Bentancur it's madness, what a will, what a player, what a sign! Love him
LMAO this is how Son silence English toxic media and pundits, that third celebration 🤩.
My my...Bentancour, Kulusevsky...look how bad Juventus right now...🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
SON🖤🖤🖤
Super son 💪👍
Super Sonic
Incredison
WHAT a hattrick sonny
letss goo sonny
Scoring goals from outside of the box with both feet is incredible.... Son the asian tiger
That is how you silence the doubters
Son is back babyyyyyyy
Son is the best player in counter-attacking situations.  Spurs' attack progressed slowly through Perišić, so Son struggled. Sending Perišić to the other side, and quickly switching attacks so that Son and Kane can counterattack, they could score a lot of goals.
Son > Salah.
Heung Min Son. 🎈🎈
Tottenham vs Leicester  will always be one of my favourite fixtures of recent times.
Trust me. Son can do it like this without perisic.
People don,t realise how good Ivan Perisic ist at 33
Son should be in REAL MADRID
This clearly shows that CONTE has gotten the wrong way of establishing and laying out the strategies, in this season. I don't know what he has in his mind but, whatever his strategic plans are... it should be re-considred and modified. Why not using the most verified & validated attacking patterns already on Spurs' hand like this,, and trying to adopt the additional forces in reinforcing & supplementing that??. --- He's been wasting the forces so inefficiently, for the 1st 7 games.
Great son 🤩
Son🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kan dari dulu emng bener duetnya si son ama  si kane ,bukan richarlison njir
페리시치 빼면 이렇게 된다니까...제발 정신좀 차려라
From now on, disregard Conte, Focus only on Team..In bench or pitch, U will prove yourself with many goals ..Sonny ,never in doubt !!
im proud with Son #from malaysia
Oh!!! Sonny😳
I'm not even a spurs fan, but DAMN I just love Son...as long as he doesn't do this against Arsenal 😁
다시 보고 또 봐도 너무 멋지다 잘했다♡ 마음고생  많았을텐데 멋지게 보여줘서 뭉클..♡ 여윽시 손흥민♡♡♡!!
It's such a pity son can't become a great player he deserves at this club..  He needs to move to a top team with potential
He is a Legend in football!..👍
Fans are amazing
BTS 봉준호 손흥민 Let's go
매디슨 영입하자
Wasted time to worry about Son.
Am man utd fan but son die hard fan.am happy to see him back in form
Right foot left foot right foot. What a complete player
son sell.
https://youtube.com/shorts/PY4v8xOC3gI?feature=share
Just absolute nonsense. Son had 17 or so attempts at goal before this. You only worry if there's no attempts or if he's not getting into position to score. Only someone who play the game knows. Sometimes it just won't go in. But it will. Eventually.
what a jaw dropping hat trick. welcome back son!
maika 1000 son babu
Total spurs LEGEND
Sebagai orang asian. Urang selaku warga banjaran kab.bandung. bangga ka anjen. Walau kita beda Nagara.
Son spamming timed finishing and finesse shots 🤣
never in doubt!!
BEST ASIAN PLAYER
why was the penalty retaken?
Welcome to Real Madrid Son Min
whata player. spurs look sharp
He's definitely back halaand should watch out now
What a player! What a guy!
Son 😱
Harusnya durasinya lebih panjang bukan cuman 2 menit karena skornya banyak
Why the penalty was given again🤔
Son better than Park
Unstoppable from Son, what the fuck dude!!!
totspur? whas that
Son underrated what a player🔥🔥
What a kick by SON😨
MOURNIHO ALREADY SAID: sonaldo nazario lima 🇰🇷❤
첫번째 골 넣고 고개 숙이고 가만히 서 있는게 멋있는데 그 장면이 없어서 아쉽...
#3 on blue team is garbage
Well done my son
SONsational~
Son is just world class 🔥🔥🔥💯
Goal number two of SON was very superb 👏
Son's hat trick was out of this planet 💉💉💉
Unbelievable what a player,he is genius.
son scores amazing goals againbst leicester
Sonaldo
Son: "He dropped me from the starting line-up... I took that personally!"
son is back
Stunning
OK Sonny is bagging goals again, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Nobody is talking about why the pen had to be retaken? That’s what I would want to know
HE'S BACK!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
These commentators sound bored
That second Leicester goal was classic 💉💉
Spurs PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 2022/2023
We should sign James Maddison.
my hero son！he just like young cr7
sonaldo🔥
WHERE THE FUCKING HATERS AT????????? BENCH SON??????? STFU AND WATCH. HE’LL SHOW AND PROVE.
Performa bagus tothenham
Son doubters = Bandwagoners who don't know football and not true fans
Son is back.
한국 인기 실시간 1위 동영상 찍었다 ㅋㅋㅋ
I'm very glad that Sonny is finally back and showed what he is capable of. Unstoppable player!
Amazing Son
Nobody: Hm son:let me try right,this time left,now right🥹
good to see that he still smiles  even  when at bench. great human.
Son in the Asian Football King 👑🔥
I have a question why city did penalty twice?
He is that guy !
SON..
Sonaldo
son's first goal, i didnt expect he will shot at the angle like that 😅👍👍👍
sonny's still thirsty. that's his power.
tottenham not a big club son need to go if he want to win something.
Son's hat trick  great!!  I have never seen anything  like this before.👍
All of the goals are beautiful ❤✨
3-5-2 !!!! ⚽⚽⚽
almost every time Kane passes the ball to Son ,Son scores..... he's like here's an assist my boy
Until Heung-Min Son appeared, Tottenham were playing trash.
wow son ...
Crazy
Waooo supoo son he his one of the underrated player in the world bcz of he iz asian .
the 2nd goal from Son was unreal
Son is so underrated!!!!!
I never doubted his class! Welcome back Sonny
Son lama tidak  cetak gol, langsung hatrick
Son!! gut gemacht!👍
Son best player asian
As arsenal fan no doubt son is so underrated, he must to get more credit
these highlights are worse than Leicester's and they are the one's who got whooped
Thaaaaaaaaat's correct positining of Sonny !!!!!
Keren
HEUNG- MIN SON...IS THE  BEST👌👌👌BIG SON👏👏👏
대단하다 쏘니♡
i know tottenham fans blame son, but son did a great job in this game and fans say they trusted him. 😂😂
오늘 활약을 한건 다행이지만 앞으로의 활약여부와 관계없이 토트넘을 떠나 다른 클럽으로 가야한다. 이번에 보여준 토트넘 및 콘테의 언행으로 언제든 토트넘은 손흥민을 버릴 준비가 되어 있다는 것을 확인했기 때문이다. 케인이 있는한 쏘니는 1등을 해도 영원한 2등이다
Son😇👏👏
SON👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💙💙💙💙💙💙
I have never realized How fast hojbjerg actually is the place for the last goal
자랑스러워 손흥민💙
He's back! Come as he is!
Just  believe
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think he is the first Asian who scored hat-trick in the epl even Oeuropean leageu
The king is back 🔥 🔥 🔥
개멋있네 ㅋㄱ 쏘니
son 's both legs have equal power  he is back with a suparb hatrick
answer is 3-5-2. plz stop fxxking 3-4-3
인터넷이 없었다면 손흥민이 저렇게 욕먹진 않았을텐데 손흥민 케인 듀오 전술은  이전 감독들의 유산이라 콘테가 자기가 구매한 선수들로 하여금  자신만의 전술을 증명해 보이려고 고집 부린결과  손흥민의 부진으로 이어 졌다고 생각함
If you get benched for no apparent reason, you can either let it break you, or use it as fuel
Woww... That was incredible.. Congratulations Son...
냄비 같은 영국놈들~
Well done son
I call him SONALDO!!            - The Special One
What a drama. Make me cry
Asian player.
This what happens when you doubt Son
Son 😮
When you score deep goals with both right and left foot, you are technically far off.  Salut Son!
Thats it. It is official now. Heung min Son never scores an average goal. Whenever this guy has a brace or hatrick it's always bangers
That second goal. Wow. Class is back.
Amazing Son kick...
손흥민 마음 고생 많았다. 이젠 혈을 뚫었으니 쭈욱 쭈욱 나가자~~!!!화이팅
I Love you Son, tripped captained him, felt sad when he didn't start. Guess who's smiling now 😌🥰🥰
Orang Asia paling keren ente son ( samson ) good job is good
나는 외국인이지만, 오늘만큼은 한국인이고싶습니다 민흥손 자랑스러워요
Form is temporary, but class is permanent. Son is one of the best players in EPL.
He's back!
Tonight was sonny show 😎
Son thinks to himself, "I wonder if I can curl one in with my right foot from this far away?"  Boom! Son thinks to himself, "I wonder if I can curl one in with my left foot from this far away?"  Double boom!!
Sun 3 feet sent away    Brendan Rodgers   goodbye
This is actually a real goal machine 😂
Son was superb as usual. if only he play for LFC, he would have achived so much more. Tottenham is so lucky to have him. it was a good game, good match.
Son Heung Min : Asian Ronaldo a.k.a SONALDO
SON DESERVES FOR BALLON D'OR
Meanwhile haaland scoring hattricks with tapins and btw i am not comparing haaland and son.
He is way to good for Tottenham
케인은 3번째 골넣을때도 달라고 손벌리는거보소 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 저정도 스코어면 그냥 해트트릭하라고 쏘라고 할수도있는데  정말 개인기록 욕심이 대박이구나  동료애가 있는거 같으면서도  저런거보면 참 정이 안가는 선수야
Did they put Kane in bench in the beginning of last season when he didnt score?  Fans were booing?   Son, now you made your statement. Ask for a trade. Go to a team where they will believe in you and support with patience.  I am tired of watching you constantly having to prove.  What else to do to prove to them?  Disgusting to start from the bench.
손흥민 굉장하다
거지같은 토트넘에서 손흥민 이적해라.....콘테 전술도 거지 같고,,,,,,
Kane son combo back 😍
와
Probably the most underrated PL player
All 6 are lucky goals , bottlers you are not going to win anything with only shear luck
Class is permanent, form is temporary.
Сон переходи в Реал.
😁😁😁😁😁💞💞💞💞💞
I want to know why the ref gave leicester another penalty after lloris save the first one?
Match of the match son !
Our own asian proud..GOAT...🇮🇳🇮🇳
It was exactly a ‘To whomever it may concern…Fxxx you’ hat trick Goal..
OMG that LOUSY overated player SINNY  is BACK 🤭🤣🙈
no7 son🤣🤣
울 손흥민선수 그동안 마음고생 엄청 심했을건데 오늘은 편히 맘껏 그기분 만끽하세요 대한민국에서 항상 응원합니다  사랑합니다  고맙습니다 👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
I don't know why Y'all was worried about Son, never doubted him for a second.
쏜!@!!!!!믿었다고!!!
Silencing the critics period
SON three letter name 3 goals three volleys hat trick
넌 최고야 손~
Son Heung-min fighting ^^~~ I'll be rooting for you forever ^^
EA do you see now. Give the man his deserved card. 🔥
Super Son is back ❤
Son is back.
yg bilang pemain badminton fixs sok banget
Son is back ✨✨🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣
Ngerirhhh son... Auto precision... Ora umum....
Kulu pass ❣❣
Harry Kane, Thank you so much for your assistance to Sonny, Harry is manly man..
존나머싯네
Even when is not scoring the opponent defence is picking up a yellow card or red card because of his pace and ability. Without the marsielle red card spurs would not have dominated that game
루카스모우라 보고싶네요 팬이에요!!
es un chingon son. el segundo gol fue una exquisita definición
Son is amazing player cuz he can strike very good with both foots 🎉❤😮
누가 번역좀 해줘라 국뽕 취해보게
8경기 동안 마음 고생이 얼마나 심했을까..ㅠㅠ
perisic is literally more interested in attacking rather than taking on his own role. Since perisic intervened so much of sons space, now son has to track back and cover his ass. Thats y they dont work at all in my opinion
Amazing son 😍
대박.
콘테야 흥민이랑 페리시치랑 같이 세우지마라 이경기를 보고 느껴라……
It is stupid not to start or take your best striker off becauses even if he is not scoring half the opponent defence is busy marking him .
SON SEX
Here comes overproud koreans people
Son , he is a World class.  no doubt 👏
손흥민, 가슴을 뛰게한다. 얼마나 기다녀왔던가..
What a game
Sonny 🥲It was so hard time
멋잇다❤
As a PSG fan, I love and respect Son. Wish he'd come to Paris! 💙❤️
Blame Son.. we won our games cuz Son kept enemies distracted on him and gave our other players chances to score so much.. he’s super impactful when he doesn’t seem like he’s doing much on the field actually the enemy is doing a lot to Son watching him so he can’t score
No doubt Son is da top!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SON TURNED BEAST MAODE OR CR7 BEAST MODE I MUST SAY SPURS ARE NAILING IT THIS TIME
Son did not smile after scoring. He does not look happy. Did not exhibit his usual celebration emotion. That should be a signal for managers to try to  persuade him to move to another club. I'm pretty sure he will get a lot of interests.
son is better than kane.
I m a liverpool fan but no one cant hate son.. he s the man he is the future
Son scoring bangers💗
Son is the best
와 손흥민 파워 무슨일 인급동 1위네ㄷㄷ
Even to those of us who don't know football, the stupidest guy is coach Conte. Tottenham should abandon Conte and Perisic
3-5-2 ^^
He's back!!
I am very happy to be able to see Son's wonderful goals.  I hope the tactic done in the 2nd half time(3-5-2, not 3-4-3) will be continued for the time being.
굉장해;; 라이브 보면서 짜릿했음
amazing left shooting
LoL man!😂🤣Is this joke man??Just too simple for Son to hit those goals from outside of the box man!! Truly amazing and fabulous 😵😱😯🤯😉😋🤟💯🙏
🇰🇷🤩🤩😍
콘테의 전술이 문제라는갈 손흥민 스스로 증명
https://youtu.be/Eab3tqws21Q
He gets three goals but doesn't celebrate a single one out of respect pure class
SON of bussiness
without Son vs with Son
Luar biasa Opah satu ini, masuk sebagai pemain pengganti ..... dummmm hatrik 13 menit.... respect pemain asia pertama hatrik tercepat di liga inggris
Never doubt SON. He will carry the team to the top just like he does every year. Enough said.
Son is underrated hes so good ...
son.
항상 골을 넣을 수는 없다 그러나 꾸준한 노력은 결코 배신하지 않는다
최고다~~~^^
ALHAMDULILLAAH 🙏🙏🙏 SON is back so emotional and hopefully goals 🙏
손흥민 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
자랑스럽다! 멋져! 역시 손 월드 클라스다
Leicester: shoot a penalty kick Spurs : so you choose death 🤯
He's back.
Go go spurt totenham, mantap 6 gol , licestee city out
믿고 있었다구..
What a great comeback from Tottenham Hotspur.. So good performance..
thank god son is back scoring goals..love from 🇳🇵...COYS!
Son is magic scoring hatrick and all of them are long range goals
그가 돌아왔다..
Son didn't smile after scoring hattrick. And someone scores a penalty in europa league and celebrates like a Final goal. 😂.  when man. United are in 7 th postion he did also like this 😂
겁나 멋잇다
world love south korea,, soth korea love tottenham
Wow.. Amazing goal from Son Heung Min 👍
ㅠㅠ
손흥민 걱정? 그게 뭐임? 먹은건가
Nice one sonny❤️
good son 🎉
Son's 2 curve shots goal🥶🥶💯💯❤❤🔥🔥
Never doubt SON Heung min!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
น้ำตาเราไหลมากหลังจากซอนนี่ทำประตูได้เราเชียซอนและเป็นกำลังใจทุกนัด
Sonny is the most underrated player in the Prem, just because he is an Asian? While their slogan says no room for racism!
We all love Son irrespective of clubs we support..... Manchester United
tai lu son son, giliran main 30 menit doang Hattrick. maen fulltime ngelawak. FPL gue udh ga pake lu lagi
Son heungmin in your area It’s not a comeback since we’ve never left
Sonny u should say goodbye to stupid Tottenham fans. They always blame and make him depressed for just few weak performance but not to Kane  it is so ridiculous attitude like racism... so ashamed of UK  Sonny u don't need to play for them  anymore  they don't deserve to watch ur performance  pls transfer to other clubs
Bentancur it's madness, what a will, what a player, what a sign! Love him
as Juve fans, there are only 2 reasons i would keep following Tot matches. ex-Juve (Conte, Bentan & Kulu) & Son. without disrespecting Kane, without them Kane would be just a lonesome hero and cannot be more incredible and enjoying his football than he was before Conte or without Son...  and for the match, that curling 2nd goal of Son was purely the instinct of world class player...
World class
we haven't played well so far, but we some how managed to get results, shows how far we've come along, Spursy   no more.. cant wait when we click.
He is back!
15분3골지리노
Yes it is!!!!!! 흥민아 축하한다!!!!
Sony Let's Leave Tottenham Next Season!
화이팅 손흥민!
쏘니 최고다!!!
언
Son had gone but now he is back
king is back
Some cracking goals fair play ! 2 of sons were absolute screamers !
두 번째 슛이 그리는 포물선 어쩜 저렇게 부드럽지;.. 대단!
JUST LEAVE THIS TEAM
손흥민❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍
He is back!
PSG: you want money?
Come to Liverpool Sonny 🙏
He’s joy to watch
COYS!
we keep forgetting that leicester is a small club that hit the jackpot for a short while.
Son!!!!!!!!!
Oh my Son..
What a hat trick from #SONNY  💜💜💜🤍🤍🤍🤍🙏💪⚽️🥇
What a comeback!! I'm a lifelong Liverpool fan but also a huge fan of Son and I was cheering out loud when he bagged the hat-trick. How about that for a statement? Two bangers and a third one-on-one. 🔥 Disclaimer: Other reason I was cheering is because I took a risk putting him in my Fantasy squad this gameweek, despite his recent form. Well that paid off nicely. Thanks, Son. 19 points in the bag! 😅
문화차이같아 어쩌면 우리나라 사람들은 손흥민을 기다려줄주아는데 영국과 영국언론들은 프로리그라 확실이 다른것같다 손흥민 잠시쉬었지만 그의 클래스는 영원하다.!
행복해
손흥민이 돌아왔구나
Son heung-min is back 🤍🤍
He's back
Poor defenders
Nggak bosan lihat gol kaki kiri nya sonaldo
I know trash when I see one. Like this Leicester keeper! That should be their top priority come January otherwise it's bottom till new year sadly 😂
He is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
손흥민 굉장하다
끝까지 포기하기 않으면 결국 된다는걸 보여준 손흥민 선수 악플러들이 욕할때 난 흥민이를 믿었다 이제부터 시작이다
Pertandingan yang indah
Son was playing fifa lol
Despite a hat-trick in the 13th minute, the South Korean star didn't smile on the pitch today.. It's really unfortunate that he ended his career with one team.. Son was top scorer last season, and most of the season he has consistently scored 10 or more goals.. This winter transfer period or after this season, in the future I really want to see him play for another team.. He can play for any club
As a United fan, i just came here for Son. I am happy for him
Sonaldo
He is back Sonny....
Woow Amazing. SON
Nice son
This is why Son now have the same ratings with Neymar in FIFA 23. But yet many people who claim their self football “experts” said Son not at the same level with Neymar 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Seringkali jarang dikasi bola oleh rekan tim 😢
This Spurs performance has put Brendan Rodgers job in danger.
감아차기 아름답다.....
OMG 😮
I see shy he said chuncks free kick is decent. Still can't believe you kept him for this long.
Where's the Conte cam?.  I love to see his reactions.
Heung min Son 👍🤠
Legend!!! heung min son is back!!!🔥🔥🔥
Good nice tottenham
Brooo Son is definitely a whole 💎
Score more than Salah now
Anjay pemain badminton
Son back
In son we trust⚽
Son's mid-range goals are cementing Tottenham's top position
*손흥민 지렸따리*
Heung-min is the Spider-Man of football: "He's Back!"
Reflect on how capricious Tottenham fans doubted him
Finally, the starting score the king!
Let's escape from Sonny Tottenham. Tottenham fans don't deserve Son Heung-min Son Heung-min's Korean fans hate Tottenham fans
Daddy Kane give a hug to Sonny...
Well, that's a THUMPING WIN! Nice! 🤗  M 🦘🏏😎
please escape Tottemham, Son! Konte and the fans bite the hand that feed them!
아 존나멋있오
wow
토트넘 역사에 저렇게 멋있게 골많이넣은 선수는 손흥민이 유일할듯
흥민아 항상 응원한다 파이팅!!!!!!!
토트넘 냄비팬을 위해서라도 이적하자... 토트넘에 있을필요... 없음 정말 쓰레기팀  몇시즌을 그렇게 충성을 했는대 8경기 골없다고 개 갈구는 팀에 있을필요가 없지  토트넘 니들은 손흥민 버려라 제발
🇰🇷😁😁😁😁
Unbelievable hattrick from Sonny!!
United fan here,ji sung park was a legend but sonny is on another level
Wow can't even make up my mind on which Son goal was better.
존나 시원시원하다
SON IS BACK
Brilliant game, I love seeing people play against Leicester as everone believes they can score from anywhere against Ward 😂
SON IS BACK
Golden boy m son
Ok
Crazy …
I love Son I wish him all the best in this season❤️
Just believe on him
PREMIER LEAGUE 7 X  BRASILEIRÃO 1
대한민국의 캡틴 손흥민👍 대한민국의 보물 손흥민👍 대한민국 최고의 선수 손흥민 !!!!!!
Son❤
Son's curling shots from long range is out of this world
절대 월드클래스입니다. 미친 골 ㄷㄷㄷ 감탄이 절로 나온다 허허허.
남은 경기들도 쓸어버리길...⚽️🥅⚽️
Son is pure class
He showed fantastic play! SON is real hero of spurs!
A friendly reminder: Form is temporary but class is permanent
SON 짱
for some reason,I got a cold sweat
Ya era hora futbolistas de Uruguay y brasil en la  nomina para mejorar
Love to see how relieved he is on first goal ❤ Standing still eyes closed while all his mates congrats him He is like : finally, a goal The lack of confidence he had the past few games due to goals impacted so much his level. It should be better now for him COYS
Son heung min,  doesn"t laugh because of conte tactics ! 8경기 동안 골이 안터지고... 너무나 속상해서 3일전 한의원 가서 머리에  침 맞고 목에 부황하고 왔네.
SONNYYYY!⚽️💨💥🙏🏾💯
진짜 지리네ㄷㄷ
Korea asian cup son 😁👌
He is BACK!
BACK IN 3 !!!
Let’s face it Son would have been considered on the level of Messi and Ronaldo had he gone to Madrid in 2018 when Ronaldo left  Spurs are lucky to have him  Also, he wouldn’t have wasted the chance like hazard did
son better than richarlison
Even as an Arsenal Fan, you have to respect the guy. Son is a legend.  Edit: Damn so many likes (Btw I'm Korean!)
지렸다
Son 🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯
❤️ son
Why did they re do the penalty? Did the keeper move too early?
Amazing Son
손흥민
Son is on 🔥
Hm_7 is my kingb
표정이 너무 안쓰럽네..
손흥민 마지막 골 넣고 골키퍼 땅치는데 좀 불쌍함..ㅋㅋ
Whatttttttttttssssss is gooodddd,,, left or right leg 😅
Yo ngunu son... siip tenan
이제 걱정끝났다....꽃길만이 남아있다!!
너무 쉽게 넣는거 아냐? 수비수들이 일 안하는거 같은데? ..요런게 월드클라스
Now I can take a breath! I was really unhappy and worried about Sonny  but now I'm so happy to see his smile.  Thank you for making my life happier Sonny!!  No matter what happened I'm always on your side! I love you Sonny!!
Happy for Son , he's back ! 🔥🔥🔥
슈마이켈 어떡하냐 🎉😂
Son is Back with his talented hat-trick .....
What a player...
EVERYONE ONE LOVES SON!
손흥민은 토트넘을 떠나야 한다.  프로가 한팀에 충성을 다하는 것은 어리석은 일이다.  특히,토트넘은 그럴 가치가 없는 팀이다. 어려울 때 헌신해도 조금만 부진하면 등을 돌리는 팀인데 뭐하러...
son membuktikan dirinya masih tajaaammm, setajam siletttt
Many spurs fan criticize him.. Fu ck them.. idiots fans..Son should leave the club..
sonaldo
공간 만들어주는 전술이 손을 날뛰게 하는구나~~ 너무 좋다!!
Son needs to find other clubs, he's way too big than this team
Сон машина, красивые голы. Лучший!!!
Are any goals by Son anything but spectacular?
I swear Emerson is becoming prime maguire 🤡
01:58 So miserable
좀 희안하긴함ㅋ팀 에이스를 대하는 태도가ㅇㅇ 태업 한번없이 이 팀에 헌신하면서 물론 사랑도 많이 받았지만 잉뽕이 유독 심한 팀 이라 그런가 용병이 잘나간다고 견제도 받고 이제는 지난시즌 득점왕인데도 팀에이스한테 한경기만에 벤치보내라 이딴 분위기 만들고 진짜 벤치에서 시작한게 너무 어이없고ㅋㅋ 경기내내 공 못받은적도 있고 미끼롤로 쓰이다가 힘빠지면 교체시키는 콘테 전술에 희생당할때도 어떻게든 범인으로 지목하고 폼 타령하던데 패스맵이나 스탯 안보고 그냥 말도안되는 여론 분위기에 휩쓸리는 현지팬들많은거같아서 여전히 신기함ㅋㅋ저번시즌에도 팀 멱살잡고 승점벌어주다가 2경기 골 못넣었다고 벤치타령했을때 아닥하라고 골 넣은거 속시원했는데ㅋ
흥민이형 의심하지마쇼
SON ,😍
He is back!!!!!!
Nice guy! Popped Back Up As Before.  Look! There's Sunny, Sunny, Sonny Really Nice Guy!  Our Number One!
What a statement from Son.
다시는 손을 의심하지 마라 눈물이 나더라😡 그동안 마음고생 했을걸 생각하니...
손흥민은 겨울이적시장 리버풀로 이적할것입니다.
Lei asal kuii terok oooo..
Son...pure class. How can you not love him. Always score amazing screamer.
SONNY!!!! i get goosebumps every time he scores and now with a tear even.. always rooting for ya sonny
Son is back!!!
He's back.
How do you score long range goals like that Sonny😍😍
Dear Antonio Conte...  Son is a 'thing'
Literally, Son of a gun! 😆😁😃
Son and Ivan Perisic cannot coexist.
What a lazy Goalkeeper 😏
I like his ‘shut up’ ceremony.
손흥민이 그도안 보여준 헌신과 노력 실력을 토트넘 잠깐의 부진으로 의심하고 오히려 더 어려움을 줬다 이제 손흥민이 더 크고 좋은 팀 더 믿어주는 빅 크럽으로 이적 했으면 좋겠다 토트넘에서 충분히 헌신했다 이제 믿음이 부족한팀에서 나갈때다
Tottenham should have signed Asia's best centre-back defender Kim Min-jae
Son only needed 13 minutes for a hat trick.
STFU the haters
마음고생한 손~~ 응원합니다 화이팅!!!
Son is like that chak de india chick. Regardless of however good position his teammate is in ....he will never pass
World class!
Good that Spurs has more scoring options, but Kane to Son is the most effective option.
Gila ni orang
나라 망신 시키는 애들 많네
Sonaldo😅
Son is the most talented player of spurs even on of the best in football
Welcome back Sonny
Tottenham fans dont have respect for son. Lots of blame to son before this game.
작년에 케인도 똑같은거 겪엇는데 케인도 이제 끝낫네 어쩌네 하면서 떠들어댓엇지 얼른 갓다 팔라고
Oh 🤣 My Son U R Supersonic ! 💕
Despite the hat trick Team  and Conte will continue to kill him!! Sonny needs to escape from Spurs to the Big Club!
Arsenal fan here but I gotta say Tottenham are looking very dangerous at the moment
Tothenham ngeri kali musim ini,, dari kedalaman pemain merata bisa2 juara dan mjd penantang kuat gelar musim ini
South Korea should really be proud of this jewell 😱
Best of best 🇰🇷🏆
Give us a conte cam
새끼 존나 멋있네 말만나로네
Think only spurs fan didn't know his worth . you guys don't deserve to have him  . Come to chelsea  :)
GOAT Sonny!
보는데 눈물이난다 항상 웃으며 경기하던 손흥민인데 차분한표정이 그동안 얼마나 맘고생이 심했는지 보여서 ㅠㅠ 그냥다른 클럽가자 이번에 언론들 팬들진짜 실망스러웠다 제일싫은건 콘테감독이고
Only him can do .. all the three goals are extraordinary, sensational 👍👍
Son is back..! Back is three
I’m a #Liverpool fan But never count out son he’s a legend believe it or not🔥🔥🔥
여러분이 찾은 한글 여기 있습니다^^ 손흥민 이제 시작입니다^^
Son is tottnem. He is legendary
Son kok dibandingkan dengan Richarlidson...hemmm
You saw how the first goal he strikes it with his right then the second with his left? Both of those goals had power behind it . Great player Son is . Give him his flowers now before it’s too late .
Time to leave sonny. 😪
Son 🥇🏆🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
Sonny….The King is returned
손흥민의 부활
King Son
Incredible Hotspurson
NO7 흥민쏜 너무좋아
Son for Barca this type of skill needs a very big club. Spare a thought for maddisson a brilliant goal scorer.
sonny came back.
이게 한국이지
WOW Sontastic~ 너무 잘해
Just trust the Top Scorer winner
Son has got back his form in last three games. The way he scored first two goals from outside the D shows his class. The first was a right footed shot and second one a left footed and goalkeeper hardly had any chance to save them.
YOHHH🤣
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS I LOVE YOLL COYS 4EVA YOU DESERVE IT YOUR HARD WORK
The headlines should read something like "The Son-sentional Super Show: South Korean Super-Sub Son Scores Spectacular Hat-trick, Showing Superb Shooting Skills, Simply Son-believable!"
Left or right foot this man is just too good!
단순히 손흥민처럼 빠르기만 해서는  절대로 빅클럽 못갑니다   손흥민은 판단속도도 느리고  퍼스트터치는 최악이에요   다만 슈팅은 월클급이라   상대적으로 약팀에 가면  중상위권 팀으로는 만들어주는 선수이나   절대로 빅클럽에서 우승할 수 있는 선수는 아닙니다    손흥민이 빅클럽에 못가고  토트넘이 무관인 이유가 이겁니다
Son!!!
개멋있다 손흥민
easy to son 😂
손흥민 멋지다🙃자랑스럽다
Where are  haters ?
SON is a LEGEND 💯
대박!!!!🎉❤
SON IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Son Goku?
This man!!! How great is to see a korean player scoring like that in PL! As a korean and as a football fan i cant believe it
손흥민 가치에 맞도록 연봉 올려라!
Those who blamed Son didn't watch the game, the World Cup really influence the game, including Kane, he was tend more to score by himself, it's totally different with the Kane-Son combo last season, it's like they connect with mind. but in this game, you can see that again, i hope it continuous.
Wow, wonderful Son👊
He is really back🙂
Pemain sebagus SON tidak di hargai di Eropa🗿 harus nya son jadi best player tahun lalu
Not a Tottenham fan though but Heung Min Son is a world class player👍🔥
Son...Yes!!👍🇲🇨
Amazing go Son!
드디어 침묵하던 손흥민 삼꼴을 터뜨리며 깊은잠에서 깨어 났다!이 기백 이용맹 계속해서 이어나가길 두손모아 빈다!
just imagine barca spend 135 of graeman on son
Left foot right foot... 🎶
I really hope he leaves. I’m sure another club would appreciate him
He is back!!!
자랑스러운 대한민국 사람 ! // son is pride of korea.
INTENSIVE 13 minutes!!!!!! OMG !!!!  Conte still don’t know the right way to use Son who can score every games!!  Son can be NEVER one of the bench lads !!!!!!
Here we goo son to man united... Fvk conte
Never in doubt
Korean tiger is loose.  Son is back with hat trick in 13 min!!!
THANK YOU SON <3
Fucking hell!!! Man scored back to back worldies!!!!
I'm LFC fan from India, but I love Son and Spurs for many reasons.
...HE'S BACK!
What the f... did Son eat ? He is back, and I f****in love it !!
Fantastic performance
Fantastic performance
간만에 시원했네 ㅎㅎ
인종차별주의자 영국인들  태세전환 개쩌네 몇년동안  니들 부진할때 멱살끌고 상위권 유지시키고 작년에는 골든부트에 챔스진출까지 시켰는데 고작 몇경기 침묵에 개같이 까고 있네 진짜 역겹다
Son 🔥
What a player spurs have got
This league and this team are very racist towards Asian players.  son needs to move his team to Spanish La Liga or German Bundesliga.
손흥민은 그냥 놔두면 자신이 맡은일은 다하는 선수야 이제 본모습을 계속 보여줄꺼야.
Son is back on track with a bang lads🔥
I never doubted Sonny but I still doubt Conte
That cross from Kulu was nastyyyy
장하다 쏘니 ~! 암 그래야지 , 이제 부상없이 멋진모습 계속 보여줘, 웃으니 좋다 쏘니~  감사해 벤탕쿠르, 케인,호이비에르😍 `
He is back! son!!
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!son
손흥민 좋은 선수인데 억까들이 문제임 ㅜㅜ
Love SoN from 🇮🇩
Sonny's third one was feared to be offside, but thankfully he was onside for it.
Silence the haters sonny…. Glad to see him smiling again!!!
손흥민 욕하지마라...지난시즌 득점왕에 대한민국 사람이다.
Absolutely immaculate
대단하다..
Son deserve better
🤍💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Son is my favorite Spurs player. So effing what, he had a little slump at the start of the season. I never gave uo. He's back and DO NOT sell him. Good lord people!
He is SSSSSOOOOO SSSSSICKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
Where are the bunch of fuxking haters??
Sonaldo is back
음침한 섬국새끼들 진짜 ㅈ같음. 섬국은 다똑같나? 흥민이만 잘되자 ❤💙❤💙
Son showed us some great sportsmanship today. After long period of frustration, he came out as a substitute, and scored hat-trick. Never give up!
Mashallah..  son  wht player..🙌
Son is back
Son underatted 🔥
HIS MAJESTY.
Conte be thinking: I am gonna bench Son every game then!!😄😜
손흥민은 그동안 토트넘을 위해 누구보다 헌신하며 최선을 다해왔다. 그럼에도 불구하고  토트넘팬들은 신의없이 그의 가치를 의심하고 쉽게 깍아내리는 끔찍한 짓들을 반복해왔다. 이제 손흥민은 그를 존중하고 제대로 대접할 더 큰 팀으로 옮겨야 한다. 손흥민은 토트넘에 할만큼 했다. 더 심한 뒤통수 맞기 전에 빨리 짐 싸자
Son
손흥민 3골 넣었더니  손흥민을 욕하던 영국언론과 손흥민을 욕하던 일명 손까들이 조용하네요 ㅎㅎ 손흥민은 한번 폭팔하면 거침없이 전진하는 폭주기관차 👍👍
돌아왔구나 손태식이
Son mulai menemukan lagi senjatanya
Son scored  amazing hat trick...i m chelsea fan but love son....
잘했다 잘했어 흥민이 화이팅~~
He is just not suit in the type of play by pericic and contes new tactics recently. Kane Son deadly duo was gone
Son of bench.... 😅
come on u spurs come on sonny 지렸다
내가 다 눈물나네
시발 얼마나 그간 열받았으면 세골넣고도 웃지를 않냐   콘테 게ㅈ ㅏ 슥
I am not the fun ot tot but i liked the video because of son
Think British fans are trash and Harry Kane is always the starting pitcher. It's a really stupid decision. It's time for Heung-Min Son to throw out the trash. Heung-Min Son no longer has to commit to the team. A really disgusting team, a really disgusting fan, and goodbye.
진짜 존멋!!
Sonny gave me goosebumps!!!!
Our Son is back
I really don't know which one is Son's dominant foot. He can score a screamer with both feet.
Son from Coree du sud ?
Good Son..
Son edan gini, kiri kanan gokilllll
대박~~소니.. 소니 환상적이야~~~
343할땐 뚝배기 원툴에다 20위팀한테 점유 밀리는데 352로 바꾸자마자 필드골 4골 ㅅㅂ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
SON what a world classs
Never in doubt. The most fatal scorer in the world.
Son = CR7 Asia
Ngerti ora Son... 👍🏻
손흥민 사랑해 시발
손흥민 가즈아~~
선발이 아닌 벤치에서 출반한 콘테의 선택은 손의 부담감을 지워주는 효과로 작용해 체력적으로 준비된 손이 최고의 활약을 보여줬다 결과적으로 콘테의 선택은 신의 한 수 였고 손도 로테이션이 긍정적이란 건 알게 된 두 마리 토끼를 잡게 된 경기였다
🤍
Sony...👏👏👏👏
Surprise surprise, the king is back!
Tottenham still tottenham as long as you know.
쏘니 파이팅 토트넘 엿먹어
상대편 선수들 좌절하는 모습이 보임.. 도저히 감당할 수 없는 영역 이란것...
all 3 goals looked perfect
Park JS = Sonny
he is back my best player. Thank God for bringing him back. It was a wonderful night.
Nice son
Korea is back with atomic power xD
Does someone know how many days took bentencur to scors his first goal for spurs??..
never never never in doubt sonny
Son👌👌👌👍👍👍👍
He is  Sonaldo   World class 👏

Spurs in dreamland and Sonny silenced all the haters with hat trick including two long range curlers ❤🎉
that first and second goal by heung min wow. that man just wonderful.
son left foot accuracy... 👍👍👍
Lol son goal long range..if this goal by messi or cr7 this would be overhype .. And content for a week ...
its hat trick time yes it is
흥민이형 please transfer another team
Bro son took it personaly
Son is one of insane player from Asia, You are great Son!
😭 ㅠㅠ finally ❤️
Who cursed at Son Heungmin for not doing well?
Son is the most underrated player in the world.  First and second goals,  the man thought he was playing FIFA!
Always an amazing feeling seeing son at his best💯
Finally his goals came back. Now his smile's trun. You can enjoy your achievement and smile brightly as usual you looks complete with your signature smile Sonny.
Indonesia sendiri
If Spur fans don’t know how to respect Son this kinda gem that every team on the planet craves for,then he better leaves the mediocre club
소름 돋아,,
This keeper was absolutely atrocious
믿고 있었다고!!!
죄다영어냐구!!
all the doubters, apology to Sonny!!!
Son is the best.....From Asia....great
"The KING IS BACK"
미쳤다....
People son saying isn't gonna perform this season and then he just shushed all his haters 🤫. Great strikes from sonny ❤️
Super son goku 🔥
One of the most score in EPL but still no trophies for him so sad 😢😢
GG son...
Tot fan = plastic fan
Nobaby will replace Sonny he is 💎💎💎
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
Son! 🔥
This is Son !!! Amazing
Its like Stephen Curry in Basketball fastbreak and long range shots are amazing.
Son won't have to be released from the team anymore, right? To hater.
Amaziiiing son... Wooowww best performance
Son is out of this world. What a world class player, just phenomenal.
KING IS BACK
A slap for the haters,... Thank u son ,... The true tottenham supporters are with u,.... Its about u r heart,... Not your form,... But your class,... ❤️Love from India,.Tamil Nadu.
I never understood people shitting on him. dude had a rough patch but there wasn't any doubt he was gonna turn it around. he too good to play like that forever. he did not deserve to start that game and I think it was the best thing for him
foolish haters , Shut up and welcome the return of the king !
Never doubted him one bit mans a killa init 🔥🔥
As a man u utd fan that some beautiful goal tottenham score  Son what can I say about him  he is a  legend
It was very good team effort by Tottenham. Son's goals were just icing on the cake.
Do Son ever had a weak foot?
Sonny
Left hook, right hook, upper cut, TKO
Now this is where tottenham need to mix 352 and 343.
손흥민...가즈아~~~
Son what a comeback champ. Eagerly waiting for your first goal.  End up in hattrick.   And once again that duo kane son.   Hopefully this form continue
Son i just can't hate him no matter what..... he is our Manhero he gives us all he got always....
Supersonic Sonny!!  He is an incredible footballer who gives us Spurs tremendous joy and emotion. It's amazing that such an absolute player who exemplifies other players and a great player who received the golden boots last season can be undervalued by fans and reporters and be on the bench. He was horribly unlucky in just eight games, he didn't get a decent goal distribution from the team, he was so tired of focusing on defense, and I trusted him. He's a world class fabulous player who's really out of our league at Tottenham. His goal is just magical! How many players can score like that in epl? I'm so happy to see his goal today.
그의 출신지가 축구의 변방이었기에 그는 항상 찬사와 존경을 받기전에 증명하고 또 증명해야 했다. 또한 그것이 그가 다른 월드클래스 선수들과 다른점이고 그것이 그의  위대함을 더 빛나게 해준다.
Heung Min Son is back 🔥
3-5-2 good
다이어세레머니 개졸멋
Son = better than everyone 👐🏿. dude struck two goal of the month contender goals using both left and right , and that ain’t talked about. never underrate him, RESPECT and PROTECT Heung Min Son at all costs! My GOAT for sure 🐐😭.
He's Bbbbback!!!!
ソン🔥🔥🔥
I'll put it in one word: "The king has returned"
Son us back now it's fun to watch spurs
Absolutely stunning goals
What a player SON. Left foot no problem, Right foot no problem, in side the box no problem, outside the box no problem. A complete forward.
Goosebumps performance by Sonsational Son....  mind blowig..respect for u man ..you are prooving urself day by day good luck
2:02 He's BBBBBACKKKKKK
The public is capricious and no glory or blame lasts forever, so Just embrace every moment and go silently! So proud of U, Son!
Supper sub 💥SON. സൂപ്പർ സബ് 💥സൺ 🙌
All the goals were so unique and fun to watch😂
Sony's back
Unhappy son! Why? You know that
Wow so so good Son is so good
Son goals are always good range or running goals bcs penalty kane takes. And tap in also kane and others
"He is back"
I love uuuu son😭✌️🔥🔥🔥🔥
최고에 순간!!! 그동안 마음의 짐을 완전히 털어버리는 교체투입 해트트릭ㄷㄷ 감동이다 진짜루😭 손흥민 굉장하다!!!!!
He is absolutely back!
Getout! London. Go to Liverpool. No more tottenhamhotspur.               From korea..
한국인 있나요~~~??????
GG son
븅신들아 그냥 흥민한테 공을 줘 축구참 힘들게 한다
손흥민 최고다
손가락 3개 ㅈㄴ 간지난다 잘봐라 니들이 비판해도 난 오늘교체 출전해서 3골넣었다 이거다!
Just started!
This game got me emotional for Sonny. And i am a gunner. All goals were outta nowhere, not your just easy tapins with worlds greatest playmakers in the league behind you.
Son min
소니를 의심하는 팬들에게 말하고 싶습니다 지난 7년간 그가 토트넘을 위해 헌신한 순간들을 떠올려 보세요!
He is back~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!!!
Welcome back Sonny
I think son kinda upset
Nice three Sonny!!!
TOT Son  King is Back!!
Sonny looks he wants to say "shut up, I just started" when he did hat-tric
그가 돌아왔다.
You can see in sons face. He is not that happy after all that benching BS
We always have to remember what he's done so far for Tottenham and believe him even though he'd be in a slump again because he'll succeed like before.😉
To the Korean fans: Please dont overreact. Real Spurs fans have always had Son’s back. The few comments judging him were from idiots who dont represent us. The smile on Conte’s face when he scored last night said it all. We love Son and we’re happy he overcame his little slump.
Alhamdulillah 3 point again
He can score anytime if you let him play in his natural position instead of forcing him to play more D and hang back like Conte forced him lately. Interesting to see whether Son will be let loose like before or this was just a one off thing.
Welcome back sonny, Danny ward is a joke 🤣
Sonny, never let your memories be greater than your dreams. You are always the pride of my nation.
미쳫다 손흥민~~~~~~~~~~
연속 노골 찍다가 보란듯이 해트트릭 꽂아버리노ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
To underestimate Sonny is a big mistake, he has scored with almost everything, left kick, right kick, heading, even solo run!! Wake up Conte!! Before it's too late!! Many teams are waiting for him.
돌아왔구나! 흥태식이!!!
It is good thing that Tottenham succeed to make diversify their score method. Headers with Perisic, Kane, Richarson... and classic son
손흥민이 돌아왔다!!!! = SON IS BACK!!!!
he's back
돌아왔구나 오태식이
Finally. Congrat son!
감히 3년 연속 best player of the year이자 Golden Boot winner를 로테이션을 돌리다니. 콘테 감독의 뜻이 아니라 영국인들의 속내를 들어낸 믿기힘든 만행임이 분명합니다. 손흥민 선수를 키워준 독일은 당신을 이런식으로 절대 배반하지 않을 것 입니다. 뮌헨으로 갑시다.  당신의 오랜 팬으로서 충언합니다.   당신이 떠먹여 준 케인의 골들은 케인의 능력으로 추켜 세우고, 케인이 골대 100미터 밖에서 패스한 볼로 당신이 100% 만들어 낸 골은 케인의 업적으로 돌리는 섬나라 습성의 영국인에 진절머리가 납니다.  제발 명문팀으로 이적하세요!!!
흥민군 수고많았어요~💕💕
국뽕 차오른다  주모 여기 막걸리한사발~
孙兴愍牛逼
Extraordinary performance  by son🔥🔥
Sonny♥️
Soooooooon !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Super SONic!! 💯💯💯
Son is back!!!
One of the most complete players that haven’t been recognized
it's been conte's strategy that caused problems for son. son clearly proved it from the match.
https://youtu.be/ScAEQXHgUgQ
우리 흥미니 하고 싶은거 다 하자~ 흥해라!!!
Son is not good player, but he just a great  player...he still has not got the recognition he deserves from club and fans....every time people talk about Messi, R7, Neymar,  Kane, Mbappe, Holland, Lawndoski, but they forget about great and team players like Son and Saundio Mane...
He's back!
Son i m going Tu buy u in my e football squade 4 sure..
I'm united fans and I love Son
I honestly think Son is the most decorated player in PL who doesn't receive the appreciation enough like European player.
손흥민 미쳤가 ㄱㄱ
돌아왔구나
@COREANO LOCO REACCIONA
한방에 몰빵하네~~~골에 굶주린 사자와 같았다
Son is so satisfying to watch....what a plaayer
Idola aing comeback anjir #COYS 🔥🔥🔥
Never in doubt
Form is temporary and Son’s class is permanent.
I always believed Sonny!!!
Son is back
We trusted Son Heung Min.. Many people like Son.. Son achieved premier league top scorer last year and is a world-renowned player.. Son is one of the best winger in the world.. He is a star with Kane at Tottenham.. Son was nominated twice for the Ballon d'Or.. . Son is South Korean King
I wasn't disappointed until the previous game. I didn't doubt his skills.
쓰레기같은 닭집에서 탈출해라.
좆간지
I like Sonny's first goal at the most❤
I will follow Son, wherevere he goes.. Im not a fan of spurs.. But only fan to son
훗... 내가 다 거만스러워지네  굉장하다 손흥민!!!
If Son visit my house, I will serve him LA Galbi for his achievement. Wonderful 3 goal today. RESPECT!!!
SON-SATIONAL🔥
สเปอร์สเป็นทีมหนึ่งที่จะลุ้นแชมป์กับแมนซิตี้.....
“He is back”
wtf son
손흥민🇰🇷
Son Heung Min is really ON FIRE!
Kalau lihat son maen kayak gini seru  banget, apalagi udah klik sama kane
SON! i proud of you
Great player son 💙
If Son is English no one put him on bench
같은 위치에서 중거리슛을 왼발 오른발로 완벽하게; 심지어 노리는 위치도 정반대ㄷㄷㄷ 골키퍼 불쌍해
em idol😘
Son❤
Son Heung-min will leave Tottenham
King is back
3-5-2 with a mid that can keep and create or else no chance of winning anything.  Mark my words.
Sooooony take me
SONNY MY LEGEND.
와우. 대단하네요 역시. 멋진 경기
존나 멋있다 이번시즌 남은경기도 화이팅~
개멋있네
Son you are an absolute treat for all football fans
My son only scores bangers 😂🔥🔥
Son is  world-class
나는 한국인이다. 나는 박지성이 맨유에 있을 때는 맨유 팬이였고, 지금은 손흥민으로 인해 토트넘팬이다.  맨유팬들은 박지성 선수가 못하면 응원을 해줬다. 토트넘팬들은 손흥민이 못하니까 그를 욕하고 미워했다.  난 이런 점이 큰 클럽과 작은 클럽의 차이라고 생각한다.  작은 클럽 토트넘은 손흥민이 간절히 필요하다. 하지만 토트넘팬들은 매경기 자기들이 원하는 것을 만족시켜줄 로봇이 필요하다.  내 생각에 다음 시즌에는 케인과 손흥민이 클럽을 떠날 것이라고 본다. 최소한 손흥민은 잡을 수 있었는데 토트넘팬들이 그를 내보낸 것이다.
Goosebumps seeing son goal
흥민선수 이번시즌 마무리 잘 하시고 이제 이적합시다. 토트넘 있는동안 할만큼 하신것 같습니다. 다른클럽에서 더 날아 올랐으면 좋겠네요.
흥민아 고생했다 이적 ㄱㄱ
comment section shows how they love sonny but if he is not scoring how they hate sonny that's the nature of humans
亚洲之光孙兴民.  他给世界看亚洲人也可以做得到.
I`m crying ^^; sonny love u~
Time to smile Son
SON did a great job today, but he didn't smile. He was the top scorer last season and put the team to the top, However, after being lost for a while due to outrageous tactics, Tottenham fans have forgotten what SON has done for the team. Hearing boos from fans who looked up to you and being ignored would have been a huge pain. This was a disregard for his sacrifice.Now,even if SON accepts a transfer offer from another club,we cannot blame him. SON deserves treatment commensurate with his skills and professionalism.
손흥민의 첫골에 관여한 저 패스는 팀원들이 손흥민을 완전히 믿는다는걸 보여준다.  앞에 수비수 2명이 버티고 있고 2선 선수들과 거리가  꽤 있음에도 최전방에 뛰고 있는 선수에게 공을 보내는건 돌파 후 마무리를 할거라고 보는거지. 완벽한 믿음이 아니면 저렇게 못주지.
Please go another better club
conte cam
믿었다 흥민아ㅠ
손흥민... 속시원하다 ㅎㅎ 가벼운맘으로  대표팀 합류하자 ㅎㅎ
Kiri kanan son  top
Crazy boy son
son is supertar😊
Conte, Don't put Perisic with Son PLEASE PLEASE. Is it hard or pretend you don't know?
그래 이거야! 페르시치랑 같이 안쓰면 댄다고!
It is useless to worry about Son
눈물찔끔. 잘했어 흥민아~
👍🙏🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
드디어 터졌구나 이제 시작이다 쏘니 맘 고생 많았다❤
Son is the best winger in Premier leaque   But, he's not a English. He is a Asian The English media didn't know him
그동안 맘고생 많았을 우리 흥민님에게 찬사를 보냅니다~ 그동안의 심정이 이 노래 가사 같았을 거 같아요~ https://youtu.be/PomhLJwVMfQ
미쳣다.
Sonaldo ❤ what a World class Player 🙂
Got goosebumps when the commentator said He’s Back!
첫골 직후 쏘니의 표정이 모든것을 말해준다. 😢
Klopp bring son to Liverpool
I can't believe I missed yesterday's match ㅠㅠ It's just the start...Son let's do it
Son was beck
I'm sorry but we really really need to sell Davison danchez. He's a disaster waiting to happen. Kinda reminds me of Titus bramble.
"King is back "
역시 손흥민~^^
I ve waited it so badly.
“He’s back. Back with threee!” The commentary though💪💪
Spurs fans are shit. When RVP didn’t score for manu for 7 games, did you hear the fans boo him? Son deserves a better team.
Sonny😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
개멋지다 시벌
Bentancur Best Man on the field!
Awe-son
Son is just too good
흥민아~~ 너 정말 너무 멋잇는거 아냐?
Son is insane !
SONNY IS BACK
We need another song for sonny.
Son over grealish anyday
😢ungrateful Coach
World class Son needs to go to a world class team
Son 😘🤩
What an amazing!!!!💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻son ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
I was hoping that Klopp would go for Son but alas !
The real oppa
He is back with 3
이적하십시요. 토트넘과 그 팬 들은 손흥민을 가질 자격이 없다. 냄비같은 놈들
Son 😎
히즈 백~~
If Son can keep hmself healthy, I can see him having a long career in EPL. He is a beast
왕의귀환...
반등의 계기를 잡은 것 같아서 기쁘긴 한데 올 시즌 퍼스트터치가 갑자기 무뎌진게 안타깝긴 하다. 일시적인 현상이길.
믿고있었어요❤
Wow, Son is no more a son but indeed a father of football.
Son. Don't forget the time you were sitting there on the bench. Tott is not the team you're running for next year. That's for sure.
후반 투입 해트트릭 ㅋㅋ
Spurs fans in the stadium all booed when Son got ball.  It was heart breaking for me.  British guys are so savage.
와우~!!! good!!!
Absolutly  amazing Son. You are my Son. Lol
son !!!!! 이게 손흥민이지..
쩐다
'He is back' that comment make me crazy
우리나라사람들 특징: 나라 안에서나 밖에서나 항상 외국인들에 맞춰줌 ㅋㅋㅋ 만약 중국이나 미국, 프랑스 사람들이 우리나라 안에서 자국민에 뉴스거리가 생겼을떄도 한국어로 댓글달았을까?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
*PL 22-23 SON 30Goals*
Just awful that this man won't get any major trophies with this club
Kimchi
사랑한다♡
이 경기는 솔직히 벤탄쿠르 골 때문에 이겻다고 본다. 중요할때 골뺏고 역전골. 이골로 인해  레스터 라인 무리하게 끌어올리다가 손흥민한테 해트트릭 헌납.
Star
와우~ 미쳤네 ㄷㄷㄷ 흥민 멋있다~~
After Chelsea vs spurs match This was the best match so far in epl for this season Leicester City played a brilliant football and the first half was mouth watering to watch...  But in the second half the two goals that were scored by son outside the box destroyed the hopes of any comeback.. Man what a game
Cameroun vs sound coréa  frendly match  soon  🔥
레전드 손흥민
Son is just too good!
Sonny's the most underrated in the league. This is gonna be his year, Spurs are taking the Prem (and my hammers are probably gonna fall off 😫)
Son, there will be heaters but you are unique. Fck them! and COYS!
Noone puts Son in the corner...
Animal!!! Never give up!!!
Pride of Korea
“Is it hattrick time? Yes it is…”   That’s it. That’s Son for you
영국 촌놈들 냄비근성보소 욕할때는 언제고
Son is the best
Son!!! 🇰🇷 🇰🇷 🇰🇷
Arsenal fan at heart, but when Son scores, it’s exciting for asian players to shine in the toughest league in the world
미쳤다 손흥민 ㅜㅜ
SONNY is BACK  !!!
Son is back 🙌
What a strike from Son...
물만난 물고기 Sonny!!
레스터전은 내 눈물버튼이 될 경기
Son 🔥🔥🔥
He's back! Back again!
그가 돌아왔다!
He is back!!
Honestly, disappointed at some spurs fans. He has dedicated himself for 7-8 years for this team and it took only several weeks to turn against him.
Why do people discriminate? Is that just the color and appearance of your skin? look like a kid
Son is back
It's sonny day.🙂🙂🙂🙂
he is worth more than city paid grealish..
Happy to see Sunny is back, keep going
Chicken defeat Fox.
게이마냥 3경기 1꼴씩 넣을 바에 1경기에 3골 넣는 게 낫지
SON > Kane   Recognize.👊
Son 🐐
SON !
This is heung min Son, heung min Son, heung min Son. This is great match for his fan who have been waiting. I’m proud that he is KOREAN!!!😊😊😊😊
페리시치 빼고 세세뇽을 손흥민 쪽에 넣으니 귀신 같이 살아남 ㅋㅋㅋ 감독만 서로 공존 못하는걸 모르는 상황
wonderful goal🎉🎉🎉손흥민 선수 축하하고 응원합니다~!!
Super sons
Son is currently the best Tottenham player.... No disrespect to Kane but I'll choose Son  over him💜
son~
352 352 352 352..Conte,Got it??
Form is temporary, Class is permernent. Just shut the Fxxx up and worship the LEGEND.
Son is back
손형 미쳤네!
Idola
손흥민한테 뭐라 하면 안돼!!!  원래 잘해 잉글아!!!
Son was shushing at Spurs fans for forgetting everything Son did for them only because he didn't score for a few games
이번게임보고 손흥민이 왜 이적해야하는지 알겠더라  저만 이런생각했나요??
He's bacccckkkkkk!!!!!!!!!! nice one Sonny:))))💯💯💪💙COYS💙
1:33 man, those defenders just watching Son coming, so scared! WTF! 🤣😂
Son 🥰🥰
흥민아~ 오늘 진짜 멋있었어!!!🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍
토트넘 떠나자 😊😊
sonny don't match Conte football. It's wrong to put a defensive burden on a striker. You have to move to another team.
손 잘하네
No matter what they say, CLASS is permanent. I have mixed emotions.  Queen took a long trip to heaven after governing us for 70 years with many deeds.  And No. 7 sonny is back again.  I respectfully express my condolences for the demise of a great queen.
sonny johnna musidda
그는 킹 손로몬
Big love for spurs and sonny from Japan
다른팀 가자. 골넣고도 웃지를 않네.
Finalllyyy son score againnnnnn
At first, it was wierd not seeing Sonny smiling after the long-waited first goal. Then soon I realized that he was paying his tribute to the beloved Queen. Thought that was beautiful.
캬 흥미니형 미춌다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
눈물이나냐ㅠ
The greatest asia player
He is back with 3!!!
YEEEEES! HE'S BACK!!!!
손흥민 굉장하다
Two stunner in a single match, crazy Son !
I think it's time to go as a replacement for Real Madrid Karim Benzema
아름다운 경기장, 아름다운 팬이있는 리그 입니다! 손흥민에 첫골 축하 합니다!
Son went Ultra instinct mode after he got pissed, just like Son Goku.
🤍❤️Son
OH MY FREAKING GOD.
SONNY THE UNDERRATED LEGEND ,HAD HE BEEN ENGLISH BOOM HE WILL BE TALK OF THE WORLD.❤✌🔥
Benched for who? Richarlison? Just a joke! 😂
holy Son💘
I love the formation 3-5-2. Love them!
왜 눈물이 나냐
🥰😍🤩
진짜 지렸다 지렸다 지렸다
Ngamuk son
Those two missiles only he could dream of, especially the left footed one was too smooth to be true 🙌
Conte played the wrong card on Sonny..just watch..
Funny how people are quick to jump on Sonny, remember August Kane, players have bad days on and off the pitch just like everyone else, great player and person, great to see him on the score sheet in style again :)
흥민이형 수고했어요 그동안 얼마나 힘들었을까ㅠㅠ
역시 우리 흥 손나 멋있다
손흥민은 빨리 토트넘을 버리고 흥민이를 밀어줄수있는 구단으로 이적해야한다.  한마디로 필요로하는 적합한 구단으로 이적해야한다. 토트넘은 아니다. 실력을 펼칠수없다.
nice sonny !!! i love u
Conte said ,hey sonny you can goal 3 in Thirty Minute . then sonny Hattric  Thirteeeeeen Min.
프리미어리그 타팀으로 이적해서 토트넘쫌 쳐발라줬음 좋겟네  현재 토트넘 수비진으론 막지도못할껄?
All Koreans are partying because of this.. LOL😆
Foreigners will always out perform your local boys and they will always be the 1st to be criticized  but will never receive the due respect admiration and hype. Personally I was happy with the super league idea. Let the English keep their league so the likes of Kane Mount Grealish Rice and co can be the highest level of average to their people and carry their league. Then we'll see how special it is. There are no more scape goats and bias narratives to be pushed. Son IS world class. 3x player of the year in 4 years but your Englishman still gets more gas and praise. Well done to sonny!
He's Back.. apologize him
오 클라스!!!!
he is back
Spurs on the training Park. Pls sack Branden or get relegated.
Transfer SON to another team. The fans of that team are more hot pot than Koreans.
😭😭😍😍
흥민아!  사랑한다!
손흥민 두 번째 골은 진짜 인공지능 추적 미사일?  그냥 툭툭 슝~ 골.. 연구 대상이다..  동서고금 지구 상에 시합 중 저런 골을 넣을 수 있는 선수는 오직 손흥민밖에 없을 듯
손흥민 감차 막으려면 미리 키컨해놔야함
Sonny should find a new club. Spurs fans suck
손흥민   흥해라
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I don't think we played well in the first half but somehow kept it even at 2 each.. the second half was much better and Bentandcur's two big interceptions literally changed the game. And then it was nice to see how we shifted to 3-5-2.. Hoib, Bentan, and Bissouma? that's one hell of midfielders to beat and Kane and Sonny on the transition? pffff.... GAME OVER.  Very high tempo, tons of goals, and Sonny's hatrick? This game doesn't really get better then this.
골 못 넣는다고 비난했으면서 3골 넣었다고 갑자기 영웅이래  리버플로 이적해야함
Hi is god 의심하지마
토트넘에 정 떨어졌다. 이적해라~ 지금이 떠날때이다.
Son is back
Good boy Son and good colleagues ~
What the sonaldo
In a Son we believe 😁
Son 그는 자신의 진가를 발휘했다 그동안 부진한 모습을 보였으나 이 경기로 자신의 가치를 증명하는 경기가 되었다.🎉
Sons 2nd goal just wow
손까들 닥치고 버로우
독기가 올랐네. 세번째 골은 케인한테 패스했으면 100% 골인데도 위험 감수하고 본인이 해결👍👍👍❤️❤️
Never stop scoring, Son. Without it for few games, fans and reporters will doubt and disrepect you again an again 😂 Even though you show loyalty for 6years with great performance, they are ready to disown you just in three or four games if you dont score.
He is back~!!!    가슴 뭉클했다고!!
I hate doubtful spurs fans. Every player can have up and downs. For the last few games, sonny got alot of blames from fans of spurs. They had impatiently blamed on Sonny until right before this gameand now they are praising Sonny. Ridiculous.
Son!!!!
KING SONNY
으아아아아!
진짜 행복 그 자체☺
Sonny is the most underrated player in the entire European football 😢
이제는 벤치 시작이냐 이렇게 영양가 없는 해트트릭은 첨본다
nevertheless The first and third goals were lucky. The first goal could have provided a better pass to Hoyvier and the third could have provided a pass to Kane. If he didn't score those two goals if not Againhave been criticized
SON is BACK 😍😍😍🎉🎉🎉
Son Heung-min, proud of Korea
시발 가슴이 웅장해진다
Is it bloody real? Wow Sonny just has comeback! 졸라 멋지다! 👍❤️🇰🇷
추카추카!!!! 첫골,헤트트릭 마니마니 축하해
He is back
축축해졌따
Long shot right and left foot wow..
Time to move on from Spurs.... Fans were hating him while fucking conte gives him worst situations ever.....use him like defender.....
Sonny. You are my hero !!!
Son love from Bangladesh... You did pass a critical time for few games but we know you are a Champion player and you come back strongly... So finally you do🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Son mantab jiwa
흥민이형 믿고 있었다구
Mantapp Son
When will Sanchez learn to play without Mistakes. He does well sometimes, but Mistakes are just too more
Son needs to move on to Liverpool.
All the Korean people played with Sonny!!!  He is our pride!!!
Spurs dont deserve Son. Let him free.
Lol at people who berated the most loyal Spurs player.
자랑스럽다 손흥민!!
Son😍
If Spurs decides to ditch him, I hope Arsenal will grab him to Emirates. He is phenomenal!
쏘니는 페리시치만 없으면 됨
Son Heung-Min 🇰🇷 Asian Proud
Son, it seems like he was playing just prove how good he is,no doubt he is a world class player.
레스터시티한테는 미안하지만 손흥민을 부활시켜줘서 고마워!!!
Sonny!!!!!!!!!
손흥민 날았다
❤❤
토트넘은 어차피 우승 못한다. 이적하자.  대우도 개판인데 뭐하러 개고생하냐. 이번 겨울에 빅클럽으로 가자.
No doubt
We need to start Kulu, he is a game changer.
가슴이 웅장해진다..
Sonny only scores bangers v Leicester.  His second goal is a carbon copy of the second goal he scored against them back in May, in the exact same position on the pitch too.
To the British...Please don't tell him to take him out of the game just because he didn't score a goal or two games...be heartbroken as a Korean
Spurs fans around the world  Helps to get me 1k subscribers  Come on you spurs #COYS 💙
ALL I GOING TO SAY IS KOREA MIGHT DO WELL WITH SON AND KIM MJ LOL
Son cahaya Asia
Son!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!
Come back
I like him hat trick hero
Left foot Right Foot🥵🥵🥵
Sonny’s left foot has romance
only proud
He’s backkk
SONALDO
The king of North London is back🔥❤️❤️
jesus! son is back
Good job min son
Son is back,  I was tearing when he made the first goal.  It was big surprise he end up with three goals.  Son is wonderful player.
Sonny is a beast ....
i love you son❤❤
💙🇰🇷💙
쌌다 ㅋㅋㅋ
👏
Son has devoted himself to the team more than anyone else for the past seven years
Son come to madrid if you want trophy
너무 감격적인 순간이다 지난 7경기에서 골을 넣지 못했다는 이유로 의심하고 비난하던 사람들과 영국의 일부언론들에게 한방먹였다 선발에서 제외하고 사기를 떨어뜨린 콘테에게도 제대로 한방먹였다 쏘니의 활약은 이제 시작이다
SON....LIMITIDE EDITION😁😁😁😁
너무 멋있게 넣는거 아니냐.... 멋져....ㅜ
Sonny hope you leave TH as soon as possible
최하위팀 상대로 홈에서 3골넣어다고 좋아하는거 보니 아버지 말씀대로 월드 클래스는 절대 아니구나
My favourite. Never doubted that he would start performing again. What an asset to the team. We should all be thankful he has remained.
Apart from Son being world-class our performance was and has been mediocre at the very best. We lose the ball quite often and creativity is like a distant dream to this team.
Son is a blessing to watch ❤
He is back!!! Back with 3!!!
let's go to lfc
진짜 좆간지나네
He is legit, the form is not temporarily but class is forever
Wow! Sonny is back !!!
Sonny has proved his goal getter ability by himself as a changed player within 13 minutes.  We need to change Conte as soon as possible. Or we will see another Spurs' tragedy 2022-2023.
Hello everyone
son🔥
Finally Sony hatrick again
Hello Tottenham Hotspur ilove love 😍😍😍
멋지다!
손흥민존은 반박불가네..
골 터지니깐 바로 헤트트릭이네?ㅎㅎㅎㅎ 참내~ 손흥민 화이팅!! 이대로 주욱 가즈아~~
레스터가 자꾸 추격해오니 쏘니가 마무리 지어버리니 경기포기 하네
오른발, 왼발이 완벽하면서 볼컨트롤 좋고 달리기 빠르면 어떤 선수인가. 월클이지
Ming Son my love love 😘🥰
국뽕이 차오른다ㅠ 멋지다 손흥민!!
2:01 , that's German 3.
Insane.....
그냥 인정!!7
no doubt
I really love son even though i am an arsenal fan.His finishing is just out of this world
어제 새벽은 대단했다.
wp son
간지
잘했다!
Fantastic!!
he's back
He is back!!
Son was made for spurs. Coming from the bench and did a hattrick. Splendid
good job son
Son hung min he is 👍 👌 👍
손흥민 심지어 숫자 3도 독일식   지긋지긋한 무득점의 터널을 벗어나서 정말 다행이다. 월드컵 이제 2달 남짓 남았는데 컨디션 끌어올려서 사고 한 번 크게 치자 대한민국의 모든 축구팬은 당신을 응원합니다
Looks like "I told you that I was the top scorer last season."
I see why son is so good with his to foot..
Greatest Asian Player💪💪
Coming soon 😅
sonny he's back🇰🇷🇰🇷👍
Crazy
Son-sational 💙
A hatrick against Liecester city is a great achievement for son 👏.  🤧😂
Where's Son haters now?
He had a lot of hard time And he proved himself. Although I am a united fan, I am waiting for his goal always. 👊👊👊👊
Great, Son got 3 goals in one match! Super Power up like dragonball haha!
Tell me who can score like what he did in the prems now? 😊👍 Sonny comeback is real!
See....Shooting quality.....awesome
흥민이형 다들 믿고있었던거 알지?
Son Cahaya Asia ☀️
Of course , Richalison and Perisic are good players. But Sonny is another level
Never doubted him... Left him in my fantasy since week 2... Sonny you beautiful player🥳🥳
This guy came to party late with a hat trick.......whose son is that?
We believe Sonny makes score! NOS!
What the hell is Son still doing in this titleless club?? SMH🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
very very good!!! SON!!!
nce Sonny!
Awesome!!! Go Sony go!!!
What a strike💥💥 hueng min son
Those guys who treat last season's top scorer as candidates! Tottenham team, coach, Tottenham you guys are not qualified!
Son... 1...2...3... wow
This son is remind me of tsubasa 😂
Son  토트넘을 떠나 .
손흥민선수 오늘은 골 넣으리라 믿었다!
SONN!!!  Asia Best Player!!!
Son is a 🐐 goat
Very happy for Son.. such a great athlete
Korean JESUS
I want son to leave Tottenham, he should go to bayern or madrid, that team is killing his glory
woo
Most underrated player in Epl💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SONNY 7 IS BACK
super son !
Son was unstoppable! And bentacur scored his first goal which im proud of bc that was a long one!
SONsational!!!!
Time to move on to a different team, Sonny. Tottenham people don’t deserve you, I’m afraid.
소오오오름
That is spur under Conte ! incredible
손흥민을 온전하게 담기에는 토트넘이라는 팀이 너무너무 작다..아는 만큼만 세상을 본다지..
Time to leave Tottenham
나는 믿었다 쏜!!! 최고오!! 새벽에 소리 지를 뻔ㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋ
🇰🇷
Sonaldo Nazario  wow no doubt
Son you beauty!
They never gave Harry Kane up but they gave up on Son, now it feels good to seem him rub 3 in your faces. Ungrateful Spurs fans.
아직도 토트넘에 있네 ㅋㅋㅋ
He deserves better team
jji jji ga oong Jang he Jin da
wow
As an Arsenal fan, and Tottenham being our derby enemies, I smiled watching Son score that hat-rick
son u did it great
내 아들이 돌아왓다 요요요요~ 😱🤙 My son is back !!
자랑스럽다 손흥민 선수 화이팅!!
he is back.
역시 쏘니다!
I love son
소니는 확끈한 경기를했다   이렇게해야 강팀을 만나도 이길수있다
Son👍👍👍👍👍
어이 레비 콘테와 케인이 문제야   콘테 케인이 문제라고   지금 토트넘에서 손은 필요가 없어보여~~~~!!!!!!!
He never smiled right after making each goal. He seems ready to leave the team if there's a chance.
Look how well Sonny plays without Perisic who takes away all of Son's space...
I'm happy that Sonny is back
When Son Heung-min enters, other team players are under tactical pressure to prevent him. Even if he doesn't score. His existence itself is creating opportunities for the team. He has already become a strategic weapon, not a tactical weapon, just as nuclear weapons become a shield even if they are not actually used.
Sonday
You cannot hate SON, the guy is humble with his achievements. Im an arsenal fan and would only watch Tottenham highlights if SON score. Wish this guy come to a bigger team.
Amazing play from Son ⚽⚽⚽
Everyone who criticized Son needs to eat s%^t now! 😂
이것이 왕의 귀환이다 !!!!쓰벌
Ronny boy sonny ❤️
대한민국의 영웅 토트넘의 영웅 손흥민!
또 하나의 역사
손흥민선수  첫골에 눈물을 참을수가  없었어요 응원합니다ᆢ사랑합니다ᆢ
Sonny is incredible
Song is back
음... 전챔피언스리그경기는 팀전체가 개판이었어...3부리그팀인줄알았음... 이번경기 이겨서 그랬지...정말 3부리그수준의 패스성공율 볼 보유력.... 공간창조능력 등등 이런팀이진짜 1부리그 4위팀인가 싶었음... 정말 콘테는 선수들 개개인의 기본적인 역략의 급격한 하락을 심각하게받아들여야됨. 빅리거팀이라면 아무리 부진한 경기를 할때라도 저정도의 개판인 볼컨트롤을 보일수는없다고확신함. 빅리거라면 팀경기력 하한선을 지금보다 한참 올리지않는다면 전경기나 전반전의 개같은 경기를 반복할듯해서 겁남....방송에서 진짜 그 지랄맞은 경기력을보고도 팀승리해서 칭찬일색인데.... 쪼팔린줄알았으면함....진짜 개진심임.....
Nice goals
Yes, it's HAT TRICK time.  No doubt sonny.
이게 손흥민이다. 영국 형님들아
Never doubted sonny. World class.
Son so amazing!
Son gets the boos cuz he's Asian and he looks easy-going. He's been a pushover for years and gets requested to help defend, play wing-back, etc. - whatever BS the team gives him. Not to mention Lloris discriminates against Son as his go-to scapegoat. He doesn't say crap to other forwarders; people take his niceness and smile for granted. Time to move on. I love how he shushed everyone today with the "y'all talk too much." Shit's borderline racist because soccer is big in England. Sometimes I wish soccer was a Korean sport.
한국인 댓글 못막냐ㅋㅋ빠가 까를 만든다고 토트넘팬이랑 손이랑 이간질해봐야 손흥민만 더 상처받는다ㅋㅋ에휴 쪽팔려ㅋㅋ
HE IS BACK.
Super son
Hey folks, never doubt Sonny…
To be great is to be misunderstood. Time to be great again, Son
내 가 슴 이 웅 장 해 진 다!!! 우리쏜 한테 지랄좀 하지마 알아서 잘하니까!!
믿고있었다고 우리흥
1번째 골  이때까지 힘들다 2번째 골 비판팬들 입 닥쳐! 3번째 골 3골? 누구?? 나야!
Pemain badminton nih boss
Wow Amazing long shoot 😎
해낼 줄 알았다 그게 약간 늦게 시작됐을 뿐이지
Son on fire 🔥
Have faith in son  (SEE!!!!)
와 손흥민 미쳤다... 진짜 이번에 토트넘과 영국 언론 실망이다...
Son is back!!!!
페리시치랑은 호흡이 안맞다는 이번 경기결과가 아닌가?
Let’s go Sonny 🐐🫶
Son you are the bEst player in the world💪💪
It's a Sonny day
he is back!
세상은 넓고 손흥민은 아직 덜 넣었다. 몇 경기 안 넣었다고 뭐라 하지 말지어다.
Sonny feeling it 😮
Where is Bench??? The only things i love totteham is because sonny..
holy shit you pulled of the game of 2022 and damn sooooonn that a god
What a comeback my Heung Min Son!!!
Even ronaldo and messi didn’t have that kind of finish right left bang who the fuk do that
Let's talk about that Kulusevski cross. Honestly, as a Juve fan, I always rated him over Kean
Marvelous!
What the strike!!!
월클이네
겨울이적시장에서 그는 이적하길바란다. 너무 많이 고생하면서 해줬는데 대우받는게 그 모양이니! 차라리 리버풀 이적해라.
남들이 아무리 씨부려도 누구보다도 최선을 다해 노력하고, 철저히 케어하는 손흥민선수와 손웅정감독님이시라서 그냥 묵묵히 응원할 뿐이다.
자랑스런 우리 흥민이~ 펄펄 나는구나!!!!!
damn leicester becomin so shit this season
아놔 저맛에 축구본다 개멋있어 손흥민ㅠㅠ
쑤와리질러!!!!
I believe in Son's quality. It doesnt lie. Absolutely!
He’s back.
This is Son Heung-min.
Son is the legend already
Please treat Son better Conte... your recent strategy does not respect sonny
It was so heartwarming to see how the players celebrated with Son. Clearly, they knew of his pain and frustration. Even Perisic ran onto the pitch to hug Son and got a yellow card as a result!  They are not just a team, they are a family.

He is  back  with  three!!! Utterly  amazing!!!
Just speechless~ ULTRA SUPER SONNY!!!!!
Where are the people who suspected Son Heung-min? These junkies
다음 경기에도 해트트릭 가자!!
흥민이형 골을 넣어도 웃지않는 모습이 맘이  아프네요..  그동안 얼마나 힘들었을까,.. 한국팬으로써 항상 응원하고 있습니다
English referees need put in a box with Lizzie. Fucking incompetent idiots done their best to shaft Tottenham today. The refs hold the premier league back by so much, they love to be the centre of attention
마음고생 컸을텐데 다행이다~~  토닥토닥 힘내자
Goal nya son di rapel
HE IS BACK
Min son is the most underrated player in the football history
가슴이 웅정해진다
He's back!!! Back with 3...!!!
Son is more lightening with the tactic 3-5-2
hat-trick. was conte problem sonny was alwaty same.
where are the fans who mocking sonny cause not scoring goals ? i cant see them
👍👍
so good to see son back <3, overall the team played played better another day another undefeated match in the PL, let's go one at a time!
he's back !!!!!!!!
흥민아 사랑한다
Sony was an angry rhino putting out the fire.
He's back
Sonny~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ hat-trick!!!!!!!!!
왼발 감아차기 미쳤다..
손흥민 잘했다!!
No doubt King is back !!!!
흥미니를 벤치에서 시작하게 하는 자체가 이미 기분이 안좋다
골을 넣어야만 좋아해주는 팬들이 진정 팬일까??
가슴이 뜨거워진다
Sonny is back. Wouldn't surprise me if he overtook the big lug at City over the course of the season.
Unbelievable! Nice Son!
It is now clear that Conte has two weapons. Delivering a cross to the striker through the wingback, and pushing the ball to Son Heung-min in the midfield There are two tactics that counterattack. In the Champions League, Conte will have to choose these two weapons properly and destroy their opponents.
go city son, and let Grealish find new team, hahaha
Son must go to another club because of fuccking tot.
손흥민!!!!!!🎉
wow! Hes back!!!
The 3-5-2 tactic with Bissouma in midfield is the heart of the son and kane duo
메시!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  코리안 메시!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kane didn't celebrate the hat trick as enthusiastically as his other teammates. At the moment, Son is hotter than Kane. Just hard for him to swallow.
흥민이가 골넣고 웃지않아. ㅜㅜ
ini baru oppa² bukan nya joget²
쏘니!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
지렸다ㅋㅋ
😭😭Even after scoring a goal, he didn't smile. I hope he can put a smile on his face again.
As I had earlier thought wrong, I now think benching Son was also good for him. Maybe while he was out he saw something he wasn't doing recently while in the pitch. That's a super-sub.
sonny,  his boots are  gold!! we love him from tottenham to seoul he got a power you know he dont need to panalties he scores from everywhere his boots are  gold!!!! 이 응원가 좀 불러줘 스퍼스팬님들 흥민아 홀란드 잡으러 가즈아 어제 날밤까고 봤는데 너무 감동이었다
한국놈들아 댓글 좀 그만..
쩔어
He's back
Son come back
맘고생많았네ㅜㅜ 화이팅!!!  꽃길만걷자!!!
no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic no perisic
He's back!!!!
손흥민은 다른 곳으로 이적했어야 한다. 몇경기 골 못 넣었다고 전 시즌 득점왕을 교체 선수로 만드는 팀이 또 있을까? Son should have moved to another place. Is there another team that makes the top scorer of the previous season a substitute just because they couldn't score in a few games?
미첬다 ㅋㅋㅋ
Sonday! Sonny 하고싶은거 다 해 사랑해💙 COYS!!
2021-2022 Premier League (MP7) (W4) (D0) (L3) (GF6) (GA10) (GD-4) (Pts12) Kane 0 goals, Son 3 goals  2022-2023 Premier League (MP7) (W5) (D2) (L0) (GF18) (GA7) (GD+11) (Pts17) Kane 6 goals, Son 3 goals  What an improvement!! 😄
Mantap
Sonny❤
I have never doubted Son. Good performance
Classs, inilah pemain terbaik Asia❤
Son must leave the Tottenham. The fans of Tottenham blamed and humiliated him for a last few week.
SON 👍👍👍
🇰🇷
Son 🔥
Tf just seen 💥💥💥💥🥹
우리흥 고생했다💙💙
i've never seen his face so unhappy although he has scored. I'm rooting for Sonny who worked hard.
never doubt
졸라 멋있어
He is BACK!!!
팬은 선수가 잘 할때는 같이 기뻐해주고  선수가 좀 부진하더라도 비난이 아니라 격려와 응원을 해줘야  선수에게 도움이 된다고 생각합니다 . 그것도 손과 케인처럼 팀에게 많은것을 공헌한 선수에겐 더욱 더... 일부 토튼햄 팬들은 그렇지 않고 손에게 비난을 퍼부어 손을 전적으로 응원하는 한국팬으로써 손의 이적을 바랄정도로  많이 실망스러웠습니다 . 그동안 해온걸 봤다면 비난말고 응원 좀 해주세요 .
역시 손흥민이다~ 자랑스럽다 대한의아들!
Heung-Min Son is the only player who can score goals easily at Tottenham and he knows how to do it. So the difference between his presence and absence is huge
소리질러!!!!!!!!!
이선수의 국적은 대한민국이다.
다시는 우리 흥민이를 의심하지마라. 특히 벤치앉히라던 놈들아!
bo go ddo bo go bo go ddo bo go
Son might be the most underrated player in the EPL these past 5 years
Commentary is next level
Keren bgt dah si oppa korea
His physical condition had been actually tip top past few games. Was just a lack of confidence . Now that he's got em back, he's unstoppable 🥳
'He's back'
SON deserves better club . hes a game changer
월드클래스
Great goals from Sonny boy 😂
Son't-Trick~
절대 의심하지마라.
sonny is world class!!!🇰🇷
Mana nih koci
손흥민 멋있다!!!! 자랑스럽고 고맙다!!!
We have to go with a 3:5:2 tactic
Sonny come Barca 😂😂
Good
이게 손흥민이다 바보같은 놈들아!!
왕의 귀환
와 미쳤네 ㅋㅋ
역쉬~~ 믿습니다. 흥민손~~
He's back haha
후련하면서 속상하다
캬 댓글들 읽으니 국뽕차오른다🤪
지쳐보이고 3골 넣었는데 행복해 보이지가 않아....
Heung-Min Son, who never lost his smile, did not smile even after scoring a goal.
살아났다
Son-sational~!
He is back with 3
i think he shoot a thousand times on training ground
자랑 스럽다 손흥민~
My goodness this boy son is crazyly underrated if he was in Barca or real they wood compare him with top players.. sometimes he gives the vive of messi from outside the box.. lethal..
프로는 프로답게 대우를, 월드 클라스는 그에 상응하는 대우를... 이제는 정말 떠나야 한다. 케인은 영국인이라서 좋은 대우와 서포트를 해 주는데. 손흥민은 아직도 테스트중이니 정말 개넘들이다. 손흥민과 흥민이 아버지는 프로답게 생각 하기를 바란다.  의리?! 프로다운 대우를 받아야 의리도 지키는것이다.  Get out of tottenham as soon as possible. You have done enough for ungrateful bastards.
No Son No Win
Son's accuracy in range shots is world class. I feel bad for leicester City, owners really need to invest in defenders
Son is back, happy to see him score hat-trick, for me he is better then overated Salah n Mane, Salah only can score his left foot, wherelse Son can score both feet,his left foot is breathtaking especially the 2nd goal. Hope this few goal can build his confidence back, especially recently his heavy first touch is awful n don't let him took a corner,Perisic is much better then him when deliver a corner. Anyway even Spurs have 3 Son or 3 Kane in the team,spurs will not get any silverware for their rest of their life,they need to get world class defender for the back four in order to talk about champion, otherwise forget it. Their defending display is awful, especially the 2nd goal they concede,Dier should have done better,he is a crap, slow n lazy player. He can't run n can't create any threat in midfield,not like Rudiger or Walker when move forward it's exciting to watch. No wonder Dier is not in England squad for 2 years,can't understand why Spurs n Conte still keep him and play almost every mtach.he should go Singapore S league to play not in PL. If I'm Conte first to fire is him follow by Davies n Hugo, get at least 3 world class defender n goalkeeper,no point keep looking for midfielders.
I'm waiting Conte CAM
오늘 아침 손흥민 감동입니다. 얼마나 힘들었을까나 싶네요. 지금부터 시작입니다. 👍
Super son is back
흥민이형 지쳐보이네...
축축축축
British fans have short memory. Only to remember todays hat trick by Son. Dont ever disown Son again.
첫골도 케인이 어시스트 할수도 잇엇네
Calm down its against a struggling Leicester team. Son had loads of space to run into which played to his strengths. that's why he's done well here. Hopefully he continues on with his form coys
I Believed him. As he has an opportunity, he does not miss it.   A Class Is Eternal.
All  korean  tear
Son~~~good
Even no being a spurs fan, every one loves Son. He's a great player but underrated.
Son... 😍
I,m  still  waiting  for so long, i  wan   sonny  to score  but  now yess we  got  the  answer,   I'm happy
지렸다
웃지를 않네 속상하게. 그렇게 손흥민을 씹어돌리던 사람들의 환호가 듣기 싫었을지도.
Son 🐐
He is back~~~
아....내 팬티 ㅠ.ㅠ
What a player Son.
Nice sony 나이스 쏘니 ~~
개지렸다
good speed, good position, good timing
Son is baaack haters, those who doubted him - I don't think any player can avoid being benched, everyone needs a break, a reset and it was Son's time. Boy did he come back with a bang! Less stir were the perfick team to do it against, they are dreadful, yet they caused us problems - Sonny made sure of 3 points! Want to see more of Bentancur raiding and scoring too #COYS
Awesome game 🔥🙌🏾
Son is back...
Does anyone in the world have that Kulu cross in their bag
Sooonnn... Soooonn... kowe gacorrr maning yaakkk... 👍
야기분딱좋다이기야
Omg i started screaming like a dog once son started scoring lmao
Sonny is back. He will make a great history for EPL. We are very proud of Sonny not only for his Korean but also for his love of Soccer.
Im here cz sonny. What e player
Korea have chance to win world cup and hopefully son wins the ballon d'or..that will make football more interesting again.
Golden boot season : 4 goals in 10 games  Now : 3 goals in 8 games  SON is on a cruise.
Son ❤️
Sonny is Back❤️❤️❤️
Son son don
Son is back!!!  Assisted BENTANCUR, Kane, Hojbjerg!
son is world class!!
Son son son
Because of Conte's tactics, Son Heung-min, the top scorer, is only playing the role of bait. Son Heung-min has to leave Tottenham because of Conte
도랏
토트넘 선수들 모두 고생했어요^^
Wonderful！！
King is back.....
Heung Min Son is like road runner ,, i loved when he run driblling then scoring 🏃🏃
Son heung-min 🤩😁.
Oh Son❤️❤️ It's safe to say he's back
솔직히 최근 쓰레기같은 전술 계속할거면 손흥민 이적했으면 좋겠다 손흥민은 벤치취급 받을 선수가 아니다
Undoubtedly, He is World class.
he's back
Where are you , fuck haters????
완벽한 부활
My Son ល្អដូចផ្កាចឹង🇰🇭🧡🇰🇷🌪
손흥민 아버지 기뻐서 손 올려 소리 지르더라
not 1 not 2 but 3 right in ur face, go on Sonny we r with u.... 😎😎
가슴이 웅장하다
우리 손흥민에게 욕을 한 구단이 토트넘팬이라는게 너무 실망했다 그를 가질 자격이 없다
콘테 손흥민 이 레스터전은 충분히 공격력 퍼부울수 있는 팀인걸알고 후반에 손흥민배치하여 골감각  만들어주는 센스
어메이징
So sad
Son Heung-min in 15 minutes covered the mouths of all his English detractors, because outside of England no one doubts that he is a crack, and also made it clear that he is a lot of player for that small club, your loyalty to the Sonny club is admired, but... it's time to go!!!
I don't think Son is small minded enough to care what the haters says. He is just disppointed and pressure himself constantly wanting to do his best which he couldn't for the past few games. He don't have to prove anything to Spurs fan. We all knew it will come eventually. Form is temporarily, but his class is permanent!  On the side note, I didn't expect Son to work so well in a 3-5-2 formation.
He is back!
use son! not richallisson conte..
Son thought leceister as north Korea and started striking from deep. Ruthless finishing.
crazy!!!
골 못넣더니 몰아넣어 버리네 역시 손흥민
PRIDE OF KOREA.
King is back
슬퍼보인다. 흥민아 ㅜㅜ 힘들겠지만  잘 참고 건강하렴!
what a performance 😍😍
Nice Sonny
he's back
Son is Back!
All you stupid Korean fans who want Son to move to another club, cry more. He's staying here because we love him. Fuck off
He's back with 3
의심하지 말아라 득점왕은 아무나 되는게 아니다
love the determination from spurs through out the game, and it's great to see Sonny scoring bangers like that again
Son is still on the way of scoring a Goal!
손흥민선수 고생많았네 이번을 계기로 다시한번 쭉쭉 뻗어나갈거라 확신합니다 화이팅
never doubt him
Who else cried when Sonny scored his first goal of the season?
I hope son can bring Korea team qualify from the H group to the next stage. Round of 16 then round of 8 Go Korea !
5252 믿고있었다구
오늘의 경기에서  대한민국  손흥민을 향한  기쁨을  함께 나눠주셔서 모든 분을  사랑합니다
"He's back!!!!!"
Form is Temporary, Class is Permanent...
개간지다 흥민쏜
좋아 ㅎㅎ 돌아왔다 마음껏 하고 싶은대로 해라
흥민이는  토트넘을 떠나는게 맞다..감독의 괴상망칙한 전술도 그렇고  몇경기 득점없다고 욕하는 팬들과 기자들도 그렇고  선수를 존중해주는 팀으로 옮기길 바란다
Hope the world saw  that this man is not a Bench player!!
The difference between Schmeichel and no Schmeichel is painfully obvious
All three goals were goals that ordinary players could not score.  He's crazy.  And because of this, no other team can raise the defensive line
Son........ ㅜㅜ  .
What the suny goals!
INSANE SON
Son🔥
진짜 맘고생 심했겠다 살빠진거봐...
Heung-Min Son needs to be transferred to another team.
쏘니에게 패스만 해주면 그는  골을 다 넣는다. 단지 그동안 그에게 패스 받는 기회가 너무 적었을 뿐 이다.
No goal no problem, just 3 for his first.
Tottenham Hotspur, who swallows sweet and spit when used!!! You don't deserve Son Heung-min.
Son is the Steph Curry of football. Scoring 3 points (screamers) like its nothing.
Son is back!
손흥민 이적 해라! 영국 토트넘 팬들은 배신자들!  그렇게 욕하더니, 태세전환들 보소 소름 끼친다
wow, he is back!
Son is underrated since he’s asian. Facts. He deserves way more recognition.
a little advice for Conte, (Kulu, son, Kane,) they are the best who have already adapted together, (Richarlison & Perisic) must be replaced
Son is out of Tottenham
Amazing son
sony…….
Son needs a class transfer.😂
손흥민!! 의심하지마세요! 응원합니다!
아 눈물 날 것 같다. 우리는 조용히 기다렸다. 이제 시작한다.
son👍👁👁👍
헤트트릭하고 he is back!할때 전율
손흥민 !!!   Heung Min Son !!!  YES !!!!   Why wasn't he in starting lineup  ?? What's the Manager's problem??
Son is a Phenomenal player
Leicester degradasi 😂
잠시 집 나갔던 영점이 돌아 왔다
Let us Kindly Not Allow The Brilliance Of Son to Overshadow the Fact that the performances of the team have been Horrible and Worrying, We win but we play the worst football in the League and Dont know how to hold on to the ball for more than 5 seconds...Players look uncomfortable in possession and constantly loosing the ball , Bissouma Needs to start every single game in that Midfield he is by far the most comfortable in possession and technical gifted of all our midfielders plus He will break up the play and bring energy...Sessegnon Is Not Good enough Chance after chance he is given he looks weak and cowardly as per the goal he allowed today ...Royal is The worst Right back I have ever seen worse than Serge Aurier even but he somehow has to get a game but Spence is nowhere to be seen...Davinson Sanchez is  a LIABILITY always doing stupid things never gonna be better ; Center Back is a sore point for years still left not addressed...
지난 몇주간 토트넘한테 여러가지로 정떨어져서 이제 그냥 손흥민만 응원하게 됨. 앞으로 손흥민만 행복하게 축구할 수 있으면 어느 팀에 있든 상관없을 것 같다…
that should shut all the doubters up,nice on sonny!!!
Amazing Son. Why don't you are in the XI starter?   Richarlison should be substitute
Good son!!
Mampir kesini gara-gara mau lihat Son
보고있나? 킬 패트릭
Definition of "Form is temporary, class is permanent."
손흥민 미쳤다 진짜! 골 보고 울컥한건 처음이예요
그래 이거야.. ㅎ 고생햇다 쏘니
Who doubted him? He already proved himself millions years ago
미쳤네ㅋㅋ분노의 헤트트릭ㅋㅋ
손흥민 골 넣으면 대박일꺼 같았는데 그것도  3골이나...  미쳤습니다 너무 놀랍네요 손흥민 선수 언제나 응원합니다
다음부터 윤석열이 주는 훈장과 악수는 거부하자
still cant believe why conte puts richardlison instead of Son. Son is the best left winger in PL by far
이런팀에 있지말고 이적하자
That is how u reply
Son GG
속이 뻥 뚫린다 ㅡ
WOW!
He's back
손흥민이 그동안 골이 없었던건 용병술의 문제라고 생각한다. 콘테...잘 봐라~~
역시 손흥민이다!
뭐가 he is back 이야ㅡㅡ 그동안 흥미니 존나 까댈땐 언제고ㅡㅡ 진짜 잘하라고
Bolton fan here, son is just on another level.
Not a few soccer fans in Korea want him to leave Spurs. I'm very angry at Spurs football boards and the poor quality of the manager. I just want to be happy to him....not in spurs...
🇰🇷
Sonshine~ You've done it again~~~ You are my Sonshine~ My only Sonshine~ You make me extremely happy When Japanese and Chinese are frigging jealous of you Sonshine~ You'll never know, dear~ How much I love you Sonshine~ Please don't take my Sonshine away~~~
Great son
Honestly, James Madison goal is wonderful
완전히 미쳤어요   ㅡㅡㅡ
드디어 예열을 끝냈구나! 이제 시작이다!
Son responds to being benched! A living Spurs Legend who has such an impact that the opposition simply had no chance against his team. Just another few hat tricks and Haaland will be going to the toilet 6 times, for each gooaall
역시 쏜 중거리슛 good
02:02 he is back!
토트넘팬들.. 바로 태세전환이네 이런팬들한테 잘해줄필요없다 다른팀가자 그리고 앞으로 쏘니가 오늘처럼 안웃었으면좋겠다
Conte's tactics aren't fun, Sony's play excites me, at least if you're a fan, you should be able to wait until the end when a player is having a hard time, but there are no such fans at Tottenham
Sonny 👍
What a 13 min hattrick by son!!!!  he is back, we are back at our best lets continue this form after the international break with a ndl coming up. tied in 1st rn. COYS
I shouldn't have underestimated him. From the start of this season, he hadn't scored any goal. I feared he would fade out of the field. but hat-trick now! We mustn't judge him by normal Asian standards cuz he is already one of world class players.
As a Tottenham fans i want see sony happy,maybe he move to bigger club' next season,,we can't blame him,,if coach can't apreciate his talent
Conte already knew..352 format fits better than 343. Adding Bissouma n Son..game totally changed. Pls keep 352...!!!
이적이 답이다 경기내용 그동안 나쁘지않았는데 자국민이였어봐라 이렇게 까였는가
흥민이 교체하니 예전 토트넘 돌아 온거 같아 정말 좋았다 이게 토트넘 이지 새벽에 환호 하며 지금일어나 댓글 적는다 흥민 돌아와서 정말 기쁘다 콘테 감독님 전술 틀린거 같지요 로테이션 케인도 같이 하면 전술인거 인정 합니다 후반 수비 강화 할려고 했는데 득점 더해 버리는거 보면 뭔가 느끼시길...
Kane is not all that enthusiastic about Son’s goals and it shows. Says a lot about his never having won anything for the team
Good game spurs🤍
손은 응원하지만 토트넘은 더이상 응원하지 않는다 !!  손은 할수만 있다면 이적하면 좋겠다
한글을 찾고있는 당신에게,  우리는 자랑스런 한국인입니다. 손흥민씨 그동안 고생하셨습니다. 당신은 최고중에 최고입니다. 요즘같은 윤정부에 실망과 갈구했던, 당신때문에, 대한국민인게 자랑스럽습니다.
한국인
Wowww son 🔥🔥🔥
Many Korean fans don't trust Antonio Conte any more. Sonny is not a assistant of Pericici but a natural born goal scorer.
1:57 케인에게 패스해야지
Never doubt to Sonny
손홍민은 축구하고 쉬는시간에 화장실에 가서 오줌안싸냐?
I say never take your eyes off him ❤️ Son ❤️
우와.. 첫골은 오른발 슛.. 두번째 골을 왼발 슛.... 지렸다...
아 손흥민 진짜 너무 잘한다 🇰🇷
국뽕튜브들 손흥민 이용해서 조회수 빨려고 신났겠네
산채스는 K리그오자
Son Heung Min... Form is temporary, but Class is permanent...
Son is back
마! 이기 소흥민이다!!!
미쳤다
Tottenham ~👍
he's back
Son is a player every club deserves and needs  Son is a backbone  Son is a real Son of Football
Form is temporary, Class is permanent ⚽️
미쳤다 쏜 ㅠ
Sonny !!! You are  my hero.
손흥민 넘버원~!
welcome back my sonny
Son is back ....
Hey Tott. You want to use Son temporarily. That's great. Now Son could leave Tott without any regret. You won't never see Son smiling in your team again as you want.
페리시치 살린다고 팀에 헌신해온 저번시즌 득점왕 벤치에서 시작시키는 팀이라니 놀랍네
기점 turning point!!!
손흥민, 이적할 수 있다면 했으면 좋겠어. 신뢰와 믿음이 없는 곳에서는 행복할 수 없어..ㅡㅡㅋ
notice the sound of celebration was 3x louder when  son scored
역시 손흥민! 👍👍👍
와 드디어 골넣었다!!!!!
미쳤다 진짜 손세이셔널!!!!
와 👍👍👍👍👍
we told y'all we told y'all mofos not to sleep on Sonny..... now y'all know!!
Great SON..  You proved that you are alive.
Gg sonnyy
son deserve better seriously
Son Heung-min has to prove it every time. Until when does he have to prove it? He is already a world class. Never doubt.
When the Leicester Goalkeeper Danny Ward said Son's MAGIC changed the game, I think he meant it. Even Danny Ward despises the R fans here.
소름~~
Itsimpossiblenottolikesonblehkcnakfhdbwnfixhanff
현지팬들 보고있냐 감히 의심을 해?
THE LEGEND
그동안 잘하고 골이 안터져서 속상했는데 오늘 다 풀리네 수고했어 항상 몸 조심하고
Good Job Son🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪
Thank you, it was so nice to see them out on the pitch today, after the last game I tried so hard to stay positive and I wasn’t very exited for this match considering how we’ve played this season but we were actually so good today, lovely seeing sonny finally scoring and hattrick in 13 minutes is just insane, so happy for him and bentancur!! Our head game atm is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 and I love to see it, next up is arsenal and beg for my mental health that we will win or at least draw😃🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Next level from Son. Cherish and record this  hat trick. It took just 13minutes. Wow...
와 왼발 오른발 미쳤다 그냥
wow
Tuyệt vời Tottenham tuyệt vời. Tinh thần đồng đội tuyệt vời. Những cái ôm chia sẻ đc áp lực cho Son
sonny is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
stupid refeere in the world 2022
He’s back!
that's right he's back! fxxkxkkxkxkxk!!!!
Now this is why you never ever ever give up on a legend!  He wasn't the only man who sighed a breath of relief , when that first one went in. Long-time comming !
손흥민 선수 너무 자랑스럽습니다. 돌아올거라 굳게 믿었습니다. 파이팅~^^
다행이다 이게 우리 손흥민 선수지
Sonny  go  Mancity
지리네..............
Wow~Son~☆☆☆
경기 하이라이트 영상 감사합니다.
Sonny is likely to be done his homework. So pity
Pero que golazos a metido heung min son 💥
토트넘 팬들너무 멋지다 홈구잘레 꼭 가보고싶어요!!
i Wish Son transfer to other team.Look at his face.He look really unhappy even he score hat trick.
👍
Son ❤
where’s Son haters?
Good
son had to pass at last goal... for better choice
So beatiful 3 gOll Son
Sonny, well done It's time to move to an other team, We've seen a lot of fucking haters from Spurs, he should not dedicate for this team for that kinda fans, I know there are still countless true fans but to be honest, if Kane hasn't any scored for 8 games, would you guys treat him like sonny which he has gotten so far ? That's bullshit ! that's why sonny wasn't smiled after scores, he looked like he was fucking tired from fan's complaints. Did you guys watch his goal ceremony? "Please shut up" ?  Just shut up🤫🤫
Por q se veía triste son ?
쏘니를 의심하고 욕하는 팬ㆍ기자. 콘테 전술이 문제
As a Korean fan, I am very fortunate to see Son having a great career at his club, but I hope he leaves the spurs team as soon as possible, where he has swears, bullies, and even his fans behave racistly against Asians.
Son is the BTS of football !
son.! Spurs doesn't deserve to get u.   Go to Liverpool
Form is temporary. Class in permanent. Son you are world class. Dejan , Perisic, you are elegance and precision.  Betancur happy for yuh. Do that in more games.  Holberg, you are our work horse
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
감동 그 자체 눈물이 났습니다. 얼마나  맘 고생했을까? Son is the best of the best !! You were so very impressed!!
손흥민 첫골에 눈물이 흐를뻔 했네요. 이게 손흥민이죠... 콘테가 손흥민 사용법을 잠시 잊은게 아닌가 싶네요. 쏘니 화이팅!! 이제 홀란드와 7골 차이 득점왕 가자~
손흥민 형이다 ㅜ 수고했어요
Koreans : Sonny is 'World Class'
흥민아!!!!!!!!!!!!!
흥민아 진짜 수고했다!!!! 축하한다!!!!
Son is Back ❤️❤️❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
오른발 왼발 오른발 페리시치 빠진 3-5-2 좋다.
that  left   footed  curler  should  be   taught   n  discussed    by   coaching  staff   in  my  life   i  hv  never   seen   a  better  curler  than  this  n  by  a  right   footer .......  magic
Sonny must change the his club. So many spurs fans in UK blamed Son. They never remember what Son has been doing for spurs. Spurs fans are very rude and disgusting.
He is back!!!!
As a arsenal fan I have to say son is a beast 💪
지렸다
교체명단으로 나왔을때 토트넘 져라 생각했는데,,,, 해트트릭이라니,,,,   항상 응원합니다 ㅡ
Sonny💙
son fantastic!!!
Electric goals from Son... Amazing finish
Baru kemarin di kritik di jebretmedia karna gak cetak gol, langsung hatrik dia, yg katanya pemain bulutangkis ini wkwkwk
4분에 한 골씩!!!
Son is my son
Son is just an incredible hulk
1:58 goalkeeper😅
흥다닥 미친 퀄리티ㅋㅋ 👍👍👍 😆😛😁😍😃 ⚽⚽⚽
He's Back!!!
Son is ready to leave Spurs. Doesn't have to stay in the team that doesn't appreciate his talent.
손흥민 3골 축하해 이젠 편안히 잠좀 잘수 있을것 같아 사랑한다 흥민아"♥♥♥
Thank yu England
콘테의 용병술이 지렸다
Son his back

I love son
Crazy
40years ago Chaboom 15 minute hattrick and..... Sonnny♡♡♡
멋지다 손 그래도 떠나자 트트넘은 아니다!!
Heung-Min-Son is back
삼흥민~!!!
i have also stopped stakin my bet on tottenham because their division kept hindering the flow of goals which leads to disapointing results; whatever footballers do indirectly affect the spectators either negatively or positively
Son is still the same SONALDO who is playing with all his hearts out for all the games. Sonaldo is what Mourinho gives Son as a nickname. Unlike the lying stupid R fans here, Mourinho doesn't lie. Jose calls Ronaldo Nazario the GOAT. Jose nicknamed Son Sonaldo, he clearly thinks very highly for Son. Jose Mourinho knows how to unleash the Son SS, Kane AMF system. Conte knows that too but he cannot play that for certain reason. Kane shows me today as an AMF, he's world class. I've been saying this for ages. Both of them have been played WRONGLY for the last few games. The R fans here call Son and Asian fans as "plastic fans". They don't realize how PLASTIC they look in front of the mirror. Imagine what the R fans here gonna spew if Son doesn't score or only score 1 Messy CR7 goal? We all already expect what nonsense and lies they're preparing. Son and Asian fans need to calm down, remember leopards will never change their spots. If they have the guts, DO THAT AGAINST Man City, we DARE them.
소니슛은 속시원함이 있다. 멋진골
Son is back 3 goals 2 beauty goals
Absolutely sensational
Let's go sonny ！！
Left foot, right foot. Never a doubt.
SOnny!!!
Son🫂🫡😮‍💨
Son king is back king is back
그동안 고생한거 생각하니 괜히 슬프네.. 앞으로 최고의 날이 더 많아지길 ㅎㅎ
he is back!!
star son
Gacor cak son
손흥민 대단하네 교체후 3골을 넣어버리네
Let's no longer prove your ability in front of fans, media, and directors. You've already done everything you can for Tottenham already. It's time to leave.
Sony look not happy this season and this game..maybe have something problem with coach or other teammates.. other plyer also not celebrate with him after score.. fan  also always critic.. son must left from this problem
됐다  이제 손흥민이 해야하는건 딱 하나다  이적   가능한빨리  이 해괴한팀을  이 인종차별팀을   이 케인이 최고여야하는팀을 쳐다도 보지말고 떠나야한다 나는 진심 단한번도  승리만을위해 가장 최적의 패스를하는 경기를  토트넘에서 본적이 없다 토트넘은 경기조차  정치적으로하는 선수들이 있는 팀이다 이건 제대로된 프로팀의 자세가 아니다 손흥민선수  반드시  빨리 이적 하십시요
흥민아 이제 달리자!!
오른발 왼발 최고네!!
가즈아~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey you disgusting tot fans..don't pretend as if you knew son would score..you filthy racists always wanted him to leave the team whenever he didn't score..To you, son is just a scoring machine. How many times did you blame him? Just think about this you S.O.B
Son's shots very great but Leicster's defend was very shit. They shouldn't have gave space to Son. His mid-range shoot is one of the best in the wolrd.  And he has fucking both footed player.
Son is an outstanding player! What a way to score again! 💙🔥
This is what we want. Offender Sonny, not defender. Sonny have to be top with Harry. Two league top scorers! They are mercyless duo. . COYS
never doubted, my Son
Left or right foot are very good
Always remember: Form is temporary Class is permanent... Y'all know what bracket Son falls in🔥
The reason Sonny hasn't scored so far is because of Conte's tactics. Tottenham fans and the media will never blame him again.😒
그동안 얼마나 마음고생이 심했을지 ...수고했어요. 당신은 대한민국의  전설입니다
Son best!💪💪💪
HE IS BACK!!😅😅
Crazy Son😢
unless kane and son put an end to their quarrel, tottenham wont go far this season. harry kane and his faction wont pass to ming son; and ming son and his faction dont pass to harry kane_ even kuluseski and his faction are also playing seperately. three division in one team; the defenders and the keeper will keep bearing the burnt.
Finally!
Son is back
언제나 응원합니다. 손흥민 파이팅!!
이적하자 흥민아
Hey Son! time to move on!!! leave TH Right now!!!! They are using you!!!! btw it was Great Goals!!!!!
The problem of Tottenham is midfielders
Hari baiknya Son👍
Wow, equally good goals with both feet, now that is really impressive
Korean PL SoN!!!!
I waited so long time to see refreshing game like this game.. oww his goals r so refreshing .
양민학살기 그 자체 ㅋㅋ 토트넘보다 잘하는팀은 못이김
Conte is incompetent and hopeless.
오 축하합니다 손
Son son 👍👍👍
I watching spurs if Son playing

한국인 없냐
호이비에르 고맙다
As a Manchester United fan,the goal hatrick from Son were amazing!!!He is a gift for Tottenham to have a marvellous talent like him 👍👍👍  All of his shooting like a dangerous missiles.Keep up a good work Son 👍👍
Son is back. .
Wow. Shit. Wow. Sonny. Really? Wow. Was it possible?
There’s huge unfriendly atmosphere against Sonny in this team and fans for very long time, especially since he became the top scorer in PL last season. It’s time to move on.
So happy to see him finally score💪
he is back
네 이럴줄 알았다~
Super Son is Back!
sonnyㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ we love you and always support you!! you are the best

손흥민은 세계축구의 역사가 될 것
에펨코리아 화이팅
손흥민!!! 부활 하다!!!!!   the Resurrection !!!!!
Ward SUCKS bro. Leicester haven’t seen a clean sheet all season and his positioning is to blame for at least 5 of the 6 goals he conceded today.
그가 돌아왔다!!
Legend is back
진짜 소름..
Three wonder goals~Full of Quality
Haters just shhhhhhhh
미쳤다 흥미니... 역시 믿고있었다!!!
Son hattrick in 13 minutes. Lewandowsky did 5 in 9 minute
손흥민 사랑합니다.
새벽에 실시간으로 본 내 자신 칭찬해

Son is so ambipedal that it’s crazy  I hope Leicester stay up though
Don’t ever doubt Sonny again!

손흥민 축하~ 올해는 발롱한번 해보자!
펄~럭~
Sonny is comming!!!
The most rated underrated player fr
Never ever doubt Son! Well, lets see how many plastic fans in this comment section.
✋️ 🤲 🤟 👋
손흥민이 벤치? 이적이지 ㅋ
전시즌 득점왕을 리그 6경기에서 단지 골이없다는 이유로 벤치인건 선수에 대한 존중이 없는거아냐? 케인이여도 그럴수 있는거야?
Having shed many tears for the Queen, I was nearly in tears again tonight, but this time it's tears of joy for Sonny. He's coming back in style absolutely. Please please do not forget Bentancur, he's had his first goal in Spurs shirt tonight which started the massacre in the 2nd half.
That pass from Kulusevski, pouaaaa
손흥민은 팀이 이기고 있을 때 나와야 됨
He's back!!!!
이적하자
Why son doesn't smile??
진짜 존나 멋있다. 아니 손흥민있다..
he is back
확실히 벤치에서 시작하니까 잘하네
대박!!!!! 축하드려요 💕
You see Sonny did it!!! Wonderful three goals.  Nice Son Nice Sonny !!!
Sonny that's enough leave Chicktonham soon you know everyone blamed you and wanted you sit on the bench after season started
Freaking monster SON!!!
Hardly anything wrong with Hugo's penalty save 🤔🤔🤔🤔 #JerzyDudek
난 쏘니를 의심하지 않았어~ 믿고 기다렸을 뿐~ 사랑해 쏘니🥰
Conte was wrong now Son was good you see last time that Son did well  but Conte just addit him in  the line up? Maybe he was in first line up Son can get 5 goals just we can say Conte was crazy
찢었네
좋아
손흥민 토트넘말고 더좋은팀으로 갔으면 좋겠다
Amazing Son!!!
소니 믿었어요 👍👍
Son completed the game
간절히 기다리고 기다렸어요~ 흥민 선수 정말 정말 축하합니다~~
존나 잘하네
3-5-2 son - kane. .tot win
시바 말이 되냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ와
씨발새끼들아. 이게 손흥민이다!
Penantang Hallaand...
흥민 쏜!! 나 죽어~~~ 👍
이제 시작이다 ⭐️
HE IS MY SON!!!🥳👨‍👦🐯⚽️🇰🇷🥰
대등하던 경기가 손투입으로 끝나버린..
해리케인은 진짜 믿고쓴다
아 시발 눈물 날거 같아.
He is fuckin’ real
저렇게 쉽게 넣으면 어떻하냐..
역시 손이 해결사군
Never underestimate Son, if you do that he will make it 3 goal But I hope he finds a new club
♥ 영웅의 귀환 ♥  언론과 엉터리 전술 아웃!! 도대체 역사를 몇 개 쓰는거야~
he made my day
손흥민 굉장하다
How is that even possible to score right and left foot at a mid range??????
교체? 주전으로 뛸수 있는 곳으로 가자. 토트넘에서 할만큼 했다. 큰 물에 큰 물고기가 있다. 더 넓고 높은 곳으로
손흥민은 대기 만성형 여유갖고 기다리면 그 이상을 해내는 세계 최고의 선수다
콘테는 지가영입한 선수로  스쿼드를 꾸릴 작정이다. 손흥민은 뒷전이다. 준비하고 있어야 한다.
지렸다.
I was going to leave a comment. but you guys did all what I wanted to say. Sonny is just more than great!
산체스 멍청한 새× 도움이 전혀 안돼
He is back
마지막에 손가락 3개 펼치고 이게나다 하는거 멋지다
He is back
손흥민⚽️⚽️⚽️
He’s back🔥
hope son join MU in january 😁
finally  Son !
Son has been given fewer chances now a day while ENGLISH tries to lift up Kane because Kane is English and Son is Asian, and YET Son did it. This is more satisfying. Son needs to move out from Tottenham. Of course, fans loved him, however, the deep conspiracy in the club is killing him.
손흥민 중거리슛 대단하다 원더풀
The goals Son scores regularly for fun with both feet most other players can only dream of doing ...world class. Nice first goal for benny too. 3 points in the bag.. Coys!
Son's season is just beginning.
John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten SON, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
와… 진짜 개쩐다
흥민이가 최고다!🤩🤩🤩
He's back!!!!!!!!!
Sony The next Legend Tottenham Hotspur
If Man Utd still SAF,  Maybe SON will be transfered to Man Utd...like kagawa & park ji sung...
흥미나 이적하자 니가 있을곳이 아니다
근데 선발제외로 좀 느낀거 있는거 같더라. 손흥민 오늘 교체출전해서 헤딩으로 공 두번이나 따냄..
What a move to bench Sonny.. he needed that haha
손 굉장하다
he's back
아 손흥민 존멋이다 진짜
Unbelievable son!!! Awesome!!! I love Tottenham all player!!
What a game. Showed every face of our game. The good the bad and the ugly. Brilliant to see Son back. Kane scored in the box..only if he would stay there. After Kulu, Sess and Perisic at RWB, Royale came on and stopped the rot. Played well, linked with everyone. Got back and supported the front guys. The biggest part of the game was moving Bentancur infront of Hojgberg and Bissouma. Bentancur is a very under appreciated player. My motm. Great players respond and boy did Son do that.  Coys
우리 쏘니 의심하지 말라구 최고의 창을 가진 토트넘 그것을 잘 이용하길 바래
매쳤다...
Can someone tell me why they rekicked the pen? I didn’t watch live
There is a someone who proud of his title in indonesia name justinus lhaksana who hates spurs so much and underestimed tgus team so much, and he is arsenal fans
Wow sonnn
⚽⚽⚽Would you like to see some predictions for the 2022 World Cup and English Premier League at your Youtube channel,Foretold by the Turtle.🐢🐢🐢
What a way to shut some mouths
흥민이  짜증나서  세레모니  개나  줘버렸다.
Tottenham"s goals were made mostly by headers. Son made goals therefore differently. It seems that there are problems in Conte.
Happy for Sonny he needed the goals 🙌🙌🙌Sonny should go to Liverpool if he wants to win trophies.... This Spurs fans are disgrace to boo him😠😠.. If Kane and Son play alongside loris how can they score
soon to real Madrid 💪💪💪💪💪🥰🥰
The last shot wasn't good. He should have passed the ball to Kane.
그동안 맘고생 심했을텐데 축하합니다!
He is back!!
1:44 손흥민 존인데 아무도 압박을 안하네
super son time
He is back!!!
nice  sonny
골 못넣는다고 그렇게 흔들어 대더니  케인 못할때도 니들 언론이 이랬더냐 에라이 썩을놈들아.   속이 후련하다 흥민아  함부르크 시절부터 팬이다. 너무 고맙다.  시끄러운 hater들은  실력으로 입을 찍어눌러주자.
super son!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
그는 최고의 선수 입니다. 언제나 그랬듯 최고일 것입니다. 다시한번 헤트트릭 축하해! 그를 사랑하지 않을수 없습니다
welcome back Sonny..ㅜㅜ been waiting for u so long
역시 쏘니 해낼줄 알았어~~ 헤트트릭이라니!!!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🎉👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
손흥민은 주변에 넓은 공간이 있어야 잘한다. 비수마 투입되고 352 만들고 해트트릭 터졌다.
우리흥 괴 빡쳤따리~~~ㅅㅅㅅ
Tottenham always needs Sonny's goal style.
손흥민골마다 다 멋지네👍👍👍 🔥🔥🔥⚽️⚽️⚽️💙💙💙👏👏👏
손흥민 굉장하다
i wanna say this, welcome back Son's
Oppa Son Come Back ❤️😽🇰🇷
멋지다
크
SON 👍👍👍👍👍
Son is one of the most underated player of the footbal history. Such a silence killer.
이것이 손에 공격력이다
ㅋ
he's back
됐고, 흥민이 억제기 페리카나는 좀 꺼져~
Pingin lihat pemain Indonesia seperti son
CRAZY SON.
Son didn’t smile today and there are big reasons. One of which is being unappreciated for his sacrifice for the team with being benched and booed for not scoring few games. He needs to move. He’ll never be able to play to his full potential with Harry Kane around him who always takes all the penalties and best striking spots. Son needs to leave Tottenham and for better teams like Liverpool for his own sake.  I hope it happens. 🤞
for those of you who doubted the man that won the golden boot just few months ago, never doubt the best man in your team. do not even try to put him down. he's back! form is temporary but the class is permenant!🔥
SON’s back.
꼴찌 팀에 세골 쳐박네 ㅋㅋ
새벽에 안자고 축구보길 너무 잘했다...
he's back
He's back!!!!!!!
Never in doubt. Sonny is back😍 #NiceOneSonny💕
🔥🔥🔥
A big shout to Kane! He knew Son was having a hard time as he didn't have any goals and I could see that Kane specifically gave targeted passes to Son to have him come back!
son is a korean!!🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇵
he is korean
원샷 원킬
Before this son only give face to his teammate and always pass to them without trying to score because he is not selfish player. However because of that he did not get a goal and even Conte threatened to bench him, that is why he is not happy. Now he will need to be selfish and try to always shoot
BENCH TO BEAST 💪👏💪 SONNY 🎩🎩🎩
Sonny is back
Son is back 🔥
All his celebrations were like: "Oh, y'all thought I was washed? Nah keep quiet"
U STILL WANT THIS MAN ON THE BENCH??????????
손흥민 멋져요
Sonny's BACK.. Never in doubt~!!! O.K??
Where is all the haters at?
손흥민은 누가 뭐라해도 세계 최고의 선수다
우리 손흥민 입니다 그는 월드클래쓰~!!
Son is back.... 🔥🔥
The king came back. His name is SON
히즈백! 개멋있다
손흥민 선수! 마음 고생 많이 했을텐데  축하드리고 감사합니다!

Give it a SON
토트넘 떠나라 흥민아
Why haven't reviews?
Sonny is back!
분명히 제외해야한다느니 그런 여론이었는데
I feel son is the best asian player of all time.
Wow영국인들의리있다!
Son deserves more than this club. Fight me.
Another Class. Goat is back Son
그곳을 떠났어야 했다.
멋지다
손흥민 토트넘 탈출 기원 1일차....결과론이지만 진작에 저딴 팀에서 탈출했어야 했음 팀에 해줄만큼 해줬고 깔끔하게 서로 헤어질때임 현지 팬들도 이제 손흥민이 지겨운것 같기도 하고 주제파악 못하고....토트넘 너희들도 흥민이 비쌀 때 파는게 이득이잖어 제발 이적시켜줘라
SON >>>> kane
Another level
한글 댓글을 찾으실 분들 여깁니다~~ 손흥민 짱~~!!
손흥민 짱
엉버리버블🎉🎉🎉
Pls pls pls leave this club and fans, they dont deserve to have you
son is definately insane
손흥민 멋지다 최고다!!
He's a. World class player
If Son is not Asian, he will alr be a superstar worldwide
우울한 요즘 내 일상의 최대 활력소..괜히 지난해 득점왕 이겠냐?  정말 감동적이다. 최고다!
좀 못한다고  손흥민을  몰아세우는 건 그 또한 인종차별임. .
고맙다..정말 고마워..   맘고생 많았을건데..  감사합니다
Главный претендент в АПЛ не из топ клубов на попадание в топ клуб это Мэдисон
No one is like son
Gile lu son
I guess the keeper was a Tottenham fan , he should have done better..
Son is one of the most underrated player in the history of premier league..  Every second on the field the lad gives his 100%. Plays for the team, never seen him playing selfishly. Just amazing..
he s back!!!
He's Back!  Yay! Son!
No Perisic cross game = Son goal
이야 고급지다
강력해진 크로스헤더골+손흥민의 필드골=토트넘우승각?
he's finally back!!!!
봤냐 이게 소니다~! Do you know~! It's Sonny~! Wow
we do play what we play well. this game is that we want  to watch. we have to base on positions that Son&Kane. they always showed what  is Tottenham style.
I hope Sonny to have smile on his face again
눈이 정화된다. .
His back~ But it doesn't matter to the team. What the team needs is to save the team from danger
ㅜㅜ  아   눈물난다...
Sonny, come back. Please don't doubt it
Kata koci son pemain amatir
What a strike, what a finish, what a player. This man only scores screamers against leicester
2:00  goal keeper
흥민쏜 지리네…
선발출전 했으면 7골 넣었겠네.
Hajii Muhammad Sonn 🔥🔥🔥😍
He is back!!!!!!!!!! Exerent!!!!!!!
richarlison is crap compared to son ... stop idolising ronaldos and kai havertz and lukakus... i will take son anyday in my lineup
another class.
Son is crazy what a great goals, He is fantastic
SON’s left foot is better than Ronaldo left foot, also better than Messi right foot. What a player
아스날,맨시티같은 강팀에게 이런 골을 보여주면 좋으련만.
Wow...소름끼친다
우리 흥민이는  최고다! 기분좋다!  너무좋다~~~
브랜든 로저스 짤리겠내
역시 우리의 영웅 손흥민 최고다~~♡♡♡
SONNY
Good Sonny boy
이게 손흥민이다!!!
Son needs to leave spurs and get some trophies!
But SON is still your step son, right?
Thou shalt not suspect Sonny.
번역이 선택이 안된당 ㅠ
진짜 다시 살아나자 우리 흥민이형
leicester should have bought Bernd leno. they have a poor keeper in danny ward
Tottenham Conte's tactics have destroyed his hand In the last game, Conte did it himself As a director, as an adult, I feel responsible You can point it out in your own way You have to reflect on yourself  The hand will leave Korean fans are curious about the rude tactics of Conte be in a fit of anger
손태식이 돌아왔구나?!!
Son has always been a scourge for Leicester.
So conte, this guy gonna bench again?
Sonny~~~~~👍👍👍👏👏👏 World Class~~~~😍😍😍 마음 고생 많았습니다~~😭😭😭 이와중에 영국여왕 서거 추모한다고 감정 절제하는 Sonny~~ 당신은 최고입니다~~👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤
Son đã trở lại 😂😂
He’s back
Het trick as soon as the tactics change
Yes he's back!
제발 골을 넣게 해 준 동료에게 먼저 감사표시를~  그렇게 이야기 해도 ~   골을 넣은것 참 잘했습니다
No doubt!!! SONNY~~
레스터는 감아차기 맛집
If all the wait was for ridiculous goals like this, I did say it was worth it. SONSATIONAL!!! 👌🔥
Conte's tactics against Tottenham manager Conte's You have to be responsible and explain Son Son of Korea needs to transfer Korean fans already want Son's transfer
I have no idea how long Son has been waiting for his first goal, and he finally started his fantastic parade! Nice one Sonny!
Over the past month, Tottenham fans and journalists have ridiculed and criticized Sonny. He has to leave for Manchester United Liverpool Real Madrid next season. Sonny has dedicated a long time to the team and was awarded the Golden Boots. Tottenham do not deserve to have him.
소니 사랑해
come on your spurs.
Amazing Son
손~ 축하해 마음고생 많았어
씨바!!!!이게 손흥민이다!!
우리 흥민 잘했다. 고생하셨습니다 👍
I showed it to England, so let's move on Hands! I don't care if you change Tottenham manager or leave
I'm crying  don't stop  Why??
The king is back
He is back. . .
개같이 부활
king is back   no more doubt  👍👍👍👍👍
he is back !!!!!!!!!
Sonsational !!!!
the goalkeeper when son scored his hattrick 🤣
Ballon d'or is son ❤
손은 후반전에 강한 사나이로 교체해서 들어가면 힘이 비축되어 날아다니리라는 예상이 적중하였으며, 앞으로도 페리시치와는 같이 선발로 뛰면 안되고,  당분간 선발이 아닌 교체로 상대편이 지쳣을 때 투입하면 더욱더 토트넘의 또 다른 강력한 후방 공격옵션으로 시너지효과를 발생할 것이다.
Fist two goals of sonny's just surreal, confidence and precision and Fifa 23.
Never doubt him. Super korean 🇰🇷
Son's Never in doubt.
this is crazy.....
wow! crazy game!
‘He is back.’
He's back
Son is Back...What a great player!!!
Is that a keeper between the sticks 🥶🥶🥶
”개같이 부활“
I think conte should put son and kane as 2-top in 3-4-1-2 formation. Richarlison has a creativity in his feet to be a SS or AMF. Perisic and kulu can take the SMF with bentancur in CMF. We need to bring kane son duo back.
자랑스럽다 손흥민!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Son is back!!!!
Sonnnnnnnnnnnnnny🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
King is back.
King is back
Son is bigger than Spurs he should leave. These fans ungrateful
World Class
Sonny is back🔥🔥
Great stuff from Bentancur too. So happy for Sonny
3번째골 케인한테 주는게 확실하지않나
슈퍼소니 미쳤다
He opened the shot gun.
Son is back!!
이번에 감 잡았으니까 올해도 달려봅시다!!
Thank You SONNY. I made 800 dollars betting that You Will win😭
골 시원시원하게 넣네  이제 골사냥 시작인가
that last goal ceremony is like '3 is enough motherf*ckers?' with bit of smile lol
The Korean fans gotta stop with the drama, aint no spurs fan hating Son, get that in your head.  He's a spurs legend, and who cares what the "experts" says, they are not Tottenham.  Conte is the manager, believe in his ability to set the right team.
what a moment!! unbelievable!!
Such a farmers league lmao. Horrible defending 😂
손흥민이 다른 팀으로 이적했다면 13분만에 토트넘의 골망을 세번 흔들었을 것입니다 손흥민은 그동안 운이 없었을 뿐입니다 나보다 어리지만 나는 그를 존경합니다 그리고 영원히 응원할 것입니다 👍
King is back
Sonny is back
Son son son
yooo menang lahh musue ecek2
Son 7🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Sonny cr7
Saints fan and you nicked our song........but.......:)   "oh when the Son begins to shine, oh when the Son begins to shine, I want to be in that number, when the Son begins to shine"  Do you sing that?  You should, he's bloody brilliant  Saints fan in peace
여전히 엄청난 선수지만 그냥 안 풀리면서 마음이 고생했을 평범한 사람
소니야 리버풀가자 그만
쏘니 첫골 넣었을때 눈물났다 ㅠㅠ
Son Let's do well in this FIFA World Cup and transfer to Liverpool or Real Madrid.
Son is up there with the best
To be fair, Leicester's defence was too fragile. But I am glad that Son's form is coming back. Hope he could keep it on with the rest of this season and silence the doubters. COYS.
This is Son Heung-min!!! He had an armed demonstration today.
He is korean!!!!!!!!
의심하지마라,,
Itu son mainnya udh level elit,waktunya pindah ke real/barca dll
미쳤다~~~~~~~~
Super Sonny⚽️⚽️⚽️I trust you!!!
When Tottenham just lead by one goal, Son just hit not once, but twice goal from outside the box. The audacity! Not to mention the hattrick that is a cherry on top He's making a statement there, he's a winner!
Bentacur + Kulu,,, Juventus will miss u so
Вот и прорвало Сона, наконец то. Как он обводящие кладёт, причем с обеих ног, фантастика.
unbelifbelllllllllll
Everyone Know Son-area right Now!!
Great son!
Yeah let's go sonny! the legend of Tottenham!
What a wonderful performance Sonny  손흥민 선수 멋진 헤트트릭 감사합니다 !!
as a city fans son you really i appreciate letsgoo asia playerrr!!!
son❤
Never doubt him. Just believe him
Who has framed Super Sonny ? The 13 minutes proved his brutality to haters when he has proper passes.
Kane and son are not clicking with each other like they did for last couple seasons. There were couple chances where Kane could have passed to Son for an easy goal, and son’s 3rd goal could have been an easier goal if he would have passed to Kane. Don’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with taking a shot when you have a chance. With 5-2 lead, i don’t blame Son for going after a hat-trick. That’s not what i am saying. Watching this duo for last 5-6 seasons, i felt like they would have made a different decision if those chances were to happen in prior seasons, and it seems like a recurring theme this season for whatever reason.  Both kane and son being gentlemen and humble human beings as they are, they probably won’t talk about it in the lockerroom. I hope Conte do something to address this and bring this duo back. We can have a legitimate shot at the title this season, if kane and son show continues. Last 30 mins of the game proves why Son shouldn’t be subbed out towards the end of the game especially when we are leading. Son is an inhibitor. His pace and his ability to cut behind the defense line stops the opposing team from pulling the line up. But from the opposing team’s perspective, they have to push the line up to have a chance at an equalizer. So when they do, this is what happen.
축하🎉 Nice day!
He is Legend.
Son they booed you remember?you're very much welcomed at mighty ARSENAL 😀
Idih serem
Sssssssssoooooooooooonnn
spurs when they want to play they are really good 😂
소니 드디어 돌아왔구나
ជយោឈ្នះទៀតហើយ💪🏆👍
NB:kulisevsky will be the king of the assist of this club if he keep playing like this.
Gazuuaaaaaaa~~~~~
Sonaldo. Sonaldinho. Sonidric. Soniski. Sonissi. A really god player.
Am I watching movie? what a magic!
Son comeback
Love Son❤
Look son's one of the best stricker in the world an underrated player.
He finally did it...World Class

역시는 역시다
흥민이형 믿고 있었어 고마워 멋진 골들 넣어줘서 흥민이형 화이팅!!!!
comeback Son Hueng Min🫅
He is korean
What's that saying? "form is temporary, class is permanent"? A class act from Sonny
Good job Son, it wasn’t you it was the poor tactics.
손흥민 선수 수고했어요. 첫골이 터지는것도 반가운데 헤트트릭까지...팬들 난리 입니다. 그동안 마음고생 털어버리고 이제 다시 시작하는 마음으로 시작하자구요.
Fuck yeah~! Hat trick from Sonny~! King is back
son>>>>other FW
In your face Sonny haters!
Very happy for sonny even as a blue fan
Son is incredible. Leister need to Call Shmeichel
Mantap Son
sorry sonny
왕이 돌아왔도다!!!! Come back king heung min
sonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Son is a real star 🌟
Please leave this team
이게 손흥민이다 이 녀석들아
son is a god
득점왕 출신 윙어를 윙백을 만들어 놓고 윙백을 윙어로 쓰는 기이한 전술. 근데 그런 전술적 희생을 손흥민의 부진이라고만 치부하는 영국언론과 팬들.. 진짜 진절머리 난다.
NEVER SEEN A PLAYER SHOOTING LIKE HIM IN TOT. what a great weapon. he is essential to win the games.
I'm a United fan but I like Son. He's class. Spurs are lucky they have a player who can score with both feet with ease like that.
It's sonny
Form is temporary, class is permanent.
자랑스러운 손흥민! 이제 시작이야. 스타는 늦게 등잔한다고 하잖아. 그래.. 이렇게 에너지를 몰아서 후반에 터트리는 것도 결과가 좋네. 밴치에 있다고 나쁜 것만은 아닌 것 같아. 심장에 불을 지르게하는 전반전 후 후반전에서 달아오른 심장을 터트리는 것도 참 좋네. 오늘 골은 퀄리티도 좋지만 너무 시원 시원한 골이었어. 오른 발 왼발 그냥 촥 촥~! 완전 꿈같은 결과였어. 이 기세를 몰아가자. 해트트릭 너무 축하하고.. 앞으로도 기본 해트트릭은 하자. 너 때문에 대한민국 국민이 나 처럼 모두 행복하고 건강한 하루를 시작하고 있을거야. 고마워. 그리고 오늘은 너의 날이야^^* 그간 고생 많았어. 얼마나 힘들어 했는지 너무나 잘 알아.. 하지만 앞으로도 더 응원하겠지만 어떠한 일이 있더라도 지금처럼 우리는 널 응원할거야. 한번더 고맙고 사랑해^^*
A lot of attention seeking trolls and online Meeks should stay quiet. True spurs fans never doubted sonny, his one of our own, supporting him through and through. This is our sonny, the one and only. Silence the critics
"king is back"
Son is criminally underated my favorite player in the prem now 👍💯
The curlers are howlers! Ou la la 👌🏾
13분에 3골이면 기네북에 오르는거 아닌가? 언젠가부터  독일의 압박축를 도입하더니 영국축구 스피드 개빠르고 지루하질 않네요. 토튼헴핫스퍼 그중에도 손흥민의 빅팬인 일인^^ 오늘 세상을 다얻은거같습니다
I was so happy and impressed for hearing about very good news. Thank you Son and big welcome comeback!
거의 모든 tottenham에 진심인 한국팬들은 흥민이가 이곳을 떠나기를 바란다 그 이유는  주급도 약하고  무엇보다 현재 팀전술이 흥민의 희생을 강요하고 있고 흥민을  계속 교체해 왔기때문이다 잊었는가? 지난 시즌  지지난시즌 케인이 부진할 때 팀을 이끌고 나아간 선수가 누구였는지
Woooooooooooow~~~~ Son is Back!!!
Nice son 👍
Son is so humble. He got three goal but never smile cuz he know that game is so important to oppomnet.
he litteraly squid game them
Eat thats stupid people.Before you criticize use your brain first
So happy for Son, from a Manchester City fan
Team with awful survivor's strategy yet Son plays like a champ.
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 Tottenham u beauty
Nice one son
각성 손흥민!!
some say this season Son hardly scored, Conte was right Sub him after come out like Lion, straight away hatricks
Finally!! WTF!! what a goal!!!! Did you see that??? He is Tottemham’s super player!!
After he shot the first goal,  he had many memories with no smiles. But he proved he's back as the King to the team.
토트넘 꺼져라.흥민아 이제 큰물가서 놀자. 손흥민 사랑해❤
Disgusting spurs fans. Go to another team SON.
Son ❤️
Come on you spurs !and sonny lets go fir the golden boot!!!
Kuch Justin : Son ini pantasnya main Badminton aja 😆
Sonny it's badminton player🗿
분노의 해트트릭
I love Son even I'm not tot fans
손흥민 마음 고생 심했을텐데 이겨내서 다행이다
Son is back!!
The goal is meaningless at a time when they are winning against a team in 20th place🤨
1:59 fresh fish
흥민아 다른팀가라 이 실력에 여기서 왜 후보하냐?
he is back에서 전율을 느꼈다..
축구 보면서 울뻔했다 축구가 아니라 인생을 사는데 있어서도  이렇게 모두가 손가락질 하고 욕을 해 대는데 평정심을 유지하고  그 비난과 멸시를 이겨내고 다시 이렇게 당당하게 설 수 있을까? 나라면 감독을 비난하고 구단을 욕하고 이적 신청을 하고 개 진상을 부렸을 것인데  확실히 흥민이는 평범하지는 않은 듯 그런 흥민이를 인간으로 존경한다  그 어려운 걸 해 내다니  하지만 난 바란다 흥민이가 리버풀에 가서 마음껏 날개를 펼쳤으면 하고
son of univers
i love son!!❤❤❤
I mean, by all means keep him on the bench if he scores a hat trick every time as a sub
Always amaze how son always scores with amazing goal
can't wait for NL Derby...will son single handedly defeat Arsenal like last time?
What a goal from soon ❤
Son again👍
He was on fire
woy justin botal liat ini wkwkwk
fantastic goal!!!!!sonny!!!!👍👍👍👍👍
Goku Son
No entiendo cómo no está Kane y Son en el Madrid , los dos se parten el lomo por el club y aun así estuvieron al borde de la gloria con alzar algún  titulo para el tottenham
Finally Son did it. We believed him
자랑스럽습니다, 손흥민 선수! 많은 이들이 묵묵하게 응원하고 있으니 화이팅하시길 바랍니다 ㅎㅎ 슛 감도 찾은것 같아 너무 좋네요 ㅋㅋㅋ
Right, left and right - that’s how you make a history
Son better than mo salah
tidak ada senyum dari Hattrick Son.
Heung Ming Son is a Greatest Asian Football
Sonaldo 💥
Welcome back, Sonny. Forget about last few games and run and gun like you are meant to.
Heung-min's goals are meaningless goals in a winning situation. It is too early to say that he is still good.😒
NEVER IN DOUBT👏
봣냐.. 나 세골이야..ㅋㅋㅋ
There are three things I love about Korean-K drama,Twice and Son. He is the best asian player❤you can always trust🎉
Why the first pinalty re-taken?
Son is a fucking beast
손흥민 사랑해
“He’s back!”  I like the way sportscaster said it! The same thrills that I felt when Voldemort did in Harrypotter.
The transformation of Son is just starting. Son, your battle with Conte is about to begin after tonight!
Wow... Sonny's hat trick that I want to watch 100 times! Congratulations, Son Heung-min ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 And Bentancur’s goal after stealing the ball was fresh and wonderful!
I had teary eyes when he just stood there after scoring his first goal. It was like he was SELF REFLECTING. Great player.
어이어이!! 우리흥 믿고 있었다고
It is time to leave.

🤗Son~⚽️⚽️⚽️Hat-trick~👏👏👏👍👍👍
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
When is this guy contract ending? United need a target man.
This guy scores some of the most beautiful goals in the EPL..
14minutes 3goals WOW~
Happy🎉🎉❤
Things that always happening against Leicester  Always many goals  Harry kane always scores Harry kane dribbling
손흥민  👍
He is bbback
Son is only rated on FIFA, fuck the premier league, he didn't even make team of the year
HM SON IS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF OUR GENERATION
Son menjawab... ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Son good boy whee
진짜 첫골 언제나오나 기다렸는데 새벽에 보다가 소리 질렀잖아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Son is a fucking beast
They didn't believe in us....they played themselves.......
어제밤 자기전 흥민이의 해트트릭을 바라며 잤는데 ㅎㅎ 교체출전으로....
He's angry.. sonshine
DAYUM! SONNY!
"He is back, back with three"
Proof time only 13 minutes
우리 손프로~ 골은 잡쉇어???👍
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
I love Son and his goals are immense, as an Everton fan who saw a mm VAR decision rob us of a goal against Liverpool, I am struggling to see how Son's last one was not offside. Glad it was allowed all the same. He's a joy to watch.
You just gotta love  Son man. Such a baller.
welcome back sonny!
I was a little concerned about Son's lack of scoring, but he seems to be back on track.  Next stop, Erling Haaland.
He’s back..
Son must leave Tott because they don't know how valuable Son is.
Soon soon soon 🔥
oh my god sonny ❤❤
son idola koci
I Love you Sonny~~~~ YOU are proud Korean
many of spurs fans who doubted and disowned Sonny just because he didn't score for a few games, you all do not deserve him. He has been the most loyal and productive player for years. He has been carrying the team practically for a while now and he's not appreciated. It has been a sad few weeks to witness so called fans disowning him
Heung-min Son, luar biasa..
I NEVER DOUBT.🤪💙🤍
최고다!!!
흥민아 토트넘 떠나자
Please stop playing Sonny with Perisic!!!! This is what Sonny can do without him!!! Also, shoutout to Bentancur today. He was amazing today!
댓글 지우니 좋냐 앂할련아
Tottenham fans need patience.
sony!
South Korean Police raping female civil petitioners .  They lure female petitioners into bars and into motels and rape them.  They say it's privacy . They are not punished at all.
쏘니가 돌아왔다 ~~~~~~~~
The Return of the King!!
Son is back 🔥🔥
He is back.
Sonny my sun🌞❤
What would you like for lunch Sonny?  I think I'll have a Super Sub.
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
Son's shots are more accurate than sniper bullets... Really Astonishing
1. Right foot Goal 2.Left foot Goal 3.Speed Boost up Goal!! All package is only happened in 14mins! Which son could do that?? Oh wait Sontaclus could delivery that package!
Heungmin Son, He is the king when the enemy plays with no pressure. But Like Chelsea did, the way to stop Heungmin Son is so clear. I still doubt in him.
Maybe it is a perfect time for Son to move on to big clubs. Some where he gets appropriate appreciation...~♡
손흥민 해트트릭❤
1st goal right foot 2nd goal left foot 3rd goal right foot
can only imagine arsenal fans celebrating the penalty😅🤣🤣
Selamat Spurs... Saya doakan Spurs menjadi juara EPL musim ini...
Son played well as a substitute. Maybe it was a problem to put him on the starter. Maybe he doesn't have the stamina for the whole game anymore. Let's continue to use him as a joker later in the game.
Sonny
Unbelievable sonyyyyyyyy absolute genius 😘💕💕💕💕♥️♥️♥️
이 팀 냄비들도 많고, 인종차별도 하고.. 손은 더 이상 충성하지말고 즐기다 이적하자. 이적해도 나는 항상 손을 응원한다.  Spurs is a lot of pots in this team, racism. Enjoy one's hands no longer loyal. Let's move to another team. I always support my Son.
Instead of celebrating his first gold of the season in great excitement, Sonny bows his head to pay respects to the Queen, Thank you, Sonny!!!! First Hattrick as a sub for Tottenham and 7th time in PL history.
He is back! back with three!
That Left footed shot... Weak foot but what a GOAL man ... Son is back🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pochettino and Lamela keep overlapping... more I don't
He’s Back!!!!!❤🎉🎉❤❤❤ SON!!!
Nerver in doubt
Highlights are sad🤢🤢,, but Son!!!! Beast
SONIPER. 4 Shootings 3 Goals
wow sonnnnnnnnnny~~~~~
Many are talking about the amazing SON, but where is Vardy, is he injured or something?
흥민이형 축하해⚽️🇰🇷
Those 2 long cruise missiles from Sonny was amazing!!! How in the world can he kick like that with his left foot??? WOW
First right leg, second left leg. Who is SON HYEUNG MIN🤯🤯🤯
Welcome back Son!!!!!!!
Stop being a rasist. when sonny doesn't score a goal in some of games, haters start to saying that sonny should be out. but, Harry didn't score a goal in ten games in a row last season, they didn't say anything at all. why always sonny should be out from starting 11? What a England fan. they always acting like a racist. if Sonny didn't score a goal at next game, they will start to insisting that sonny should be out soon again.
Hattrick only in 13mins, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE SON
흔들라~~~~~
지린다.흥민
제발 손흥민선수를 제대로 활용해주세요ㅠㅠ  제발 손흥민선수의 능력을 의심하지 마세요~  역시 손흥민선수!! 해트트릭 너무 축하합니다~ 손흥민선수는 패스만 연결된다면 골을 넣을 수 있는 능력있는 선수라구요!!
Heung min son comeback
My son doesn’t score. When he does, he takes the ball home
Goal of the month: 1. Son left foot 2. Son right foot
Who the hell scores from 25feet with left and right foot??? Holycow Son
aian sayur
Good, the bench made him focused, he's taking it seriously. No smile means he's more up to it now. He knows he wasn't good, and he knows this isn't really enough to prove he's back at it, Leicester are dead, now the real challenges come.
토트넘=엠블럼처럼 Chicken head  왜냐고? 세계 최고의 공격수를 가졌으면서 최악의 전술과 팸덤
No one can deny the fact that Sonny proved he is the world class player. He deserves to get two-thumbs up and standing ovation  ^^
Don’t be so hyped. I think you guys kinda lost him today. After today’s incident I wouldn’t be surprised if he left spurs in a couple of years
NEVER bench son
LEAVE SPURS SON
What a SONNY day ☀️☀️☀️
I'm Son Heungmin, the top scorer 3 goals in 13 minutes
Sonny's back baby!
손흥민 2번째 골은 진짜... 미친거 아님...??? 와.. 또 하나의 역대급 골이네 ^_^⚽️
Bunch of two faced jokers.  Want him out of starting line up and boooed him when he couldnt score and now back to cheering mode.  Humanity never changes
Bissouma🔥 2nd half of hojbjerg🔥
Good job son
Kia~ jumo!!
Son is a world star player. If you are a real Tottenham Hot Spur fan, Please, Never doubt his fantastic talent.
자~손흥민 이제 토트넘만 떠나면된다!!  이적 준비해서 실력을 알아주고 널원하는곳으로가자!!
Son Is Back 🔥
Welcome back Sonny!!!
뉴욕에서 기쁨의 눈물을 쏟았다. 힘이 난다. Tears of joy shed at his goal. Sonny Your achievements give me great strength.
SONaldo is so special!
Welcome back Son... ^^
Honestly this rule that the keeper has to be stepping the line is so unfair for keepers like is already super hard to save one why wont we make it harder maybe next rule should be to not use his hands
😏😏😏😏 💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Spurs legends rise , a new era , f*ck to haters 🖕 , SONNY legend
Казах лучший
NEVER IN DOUBT!!!
Unlike the last season, Son didn't show his trademark today: full of happy smile. All his celebration was done firmly quiet, seem like a message to all the haters, doubters and gossipers.  This hat-trick today, done in only 14 minutes, is Sonny's definite show-and-prove of his class to all over the world.  I would almost come up with tears with his first goal, when he just stood up still and hugged Harry Kane.  Now he has started his scoring streak just now! 30 EPL games + more UCL games + lots of cup games left, Son will surely show us his top-class ability from now on!
Finally he's back.  Please give him the ball right, children of Kane. He is originally a fantastic man.
King is back.
Sack Leicester City
콘테는 제발 좀 새로 들인 이상한 신인들 끼워넣고 말도 안되는 전략 좀 사용하지마라 !!!      지금 토트넘의 가장 좋은 공격 방법은 손흥민을 상대 수비수 라인에 걸쳐 놓고 걸어다니게 하면서 기회가 왔을 때  신속한 침투로 인하여 골을 넣는 것이 최선의 공격 방법이다. 그렇게 볼만 공급해주면 손흥민은 50골도 넣을 것이다.  문제 하나 없다. 챔스도 우승할 수 있다. 왜 자꾸 새로 들어온 페리시치를 넣어서 손흥민 자리를 다 잡아먹고 그러는가 ???
I need the all-angle video for Son's hat-trick
흥태식이 돌아왔구나!
I bet arsehole fans are pooing themselves about now ⚽🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  COYS
Son doesn't have a weaker foot
All it took was getting benched and he got his mojo back 😅
That first Son goal is fantastic, the way he shifts it right to get the ball into the area to wrap his foot around , and the way it's hit ,  with such venom !   The second one I'm not even going there. That's his wrong foot ?!   What a player , I'd love him at United.   Class , pure class !!
진짜너무멋지다
As an arsenal fan I hate Tottenham. But that bowyyy sonnnyyy 🔥 😭
king is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
There’s no doubt. Just trust him.👍👍
Where did all the Tottenham fans happy when Sonny was on the bench??? And now they're saying it's our player? If you are a true fan, you must have basic manners to support and wait for your favorite player. We call it "respect"!!!! I can`t forget how Sonny was insulted and ridiculed by Tottenham fans in the last matches he failed to score. Koreans do not easily betray someone once they give their heart to them. Sonny Fighting!!!!
손흥민 다 좋은데, 기복만 줄였으면 좋겠다.
I made new `Sonny (Son Heang Min) Song' 5day ago.You can left my face click,You must feel amasing music! Sonny Song.
He's back
Both feet from distance says it all.
대한민국 손흥민 역시 최고의 선수!
Nice on sonny
나이쓰 원 쏘니!! Don't doubt him any more. He's a world class !
Thanks for Son & all his Fan! Never Doubt on Sonny!
Leicester very strong opposition bahahahahaha
Cha Bum-Kun is the best Asian player after Singapore's legendary ethnic Malay Fandi Alamat! TQ
Wow, Chelsea can definitely use Sonny like gold. Haters of Sonny should really think of him seriously. Think about him on the opposite side of the field. Pretty sure you’ll regret it.
Sonny woke up and chose violence 🔥🔥
Sonny back lovely watch out sporting lisbon and Frankfurt
sɪʟᴇɴᴄɪɴɢ ᴄʀɪᴛɪᴄs ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴀ ʜᴀᴛᴛʀɪᴄᴋ 🔥🔥🔥
Leicester games are going to be Tottenham favorites with this record...
Son's hattrick goals were all sensational, his second goal was so beautiful, absolutely world class 👏 손흥민 대박! 🤍
SON always no mercy on Leicester !! bang!
아..눈물나네요 흥민 선수 화이팅입니다
Many People even hometown fans also criticize him so badly but he overcame I'm really proud of him.
슬프다. 쏘니가 골을 넣고도 기뻐하지 않네...그동안의 마음고생이 느껴집니다. 쏘니가 자신을 조금더 존중해줄수 있는 클럽으로 이적하길 바랍니다.
쏘니!최고였다 💜 💜 💜
How stupid that Conte was !
손태식이~ 돌아왔구나~!!
I swear that’s the most emotions I ever heard from that guy😂
Back with freaking 3!!!!!!!!!
Personally, I think Son Heung-min is one of the most underrated footballers in the world. He’s a top player in an average club. He’s incredible.
SON ❤️❤️❤️
SON ❤️❤️❤️
Ok, son is son. But, why don't you Tottenham buy 김민재 from the Napoli?? I heard that during the summer transfer market Tottenham tried to scout him but now he is in Napoli. I can't believe why you gave up him?! It was bad decision. Maybe next season you can bring him for a reasonable price! He has shown outstanding performance so far. I think he can overwhelm almost all the EPL defenders.
I was there right up close to the pit h atmosphere was incredible spurs played incredibly well especially in that second half COYS🤍
It appears most commentators missed the fact that Son perform very well when the team is on counter offensive mode.
SON ❤️❤️❤️
손흥민이 그간 고생한거 생각하면 눈물난다....😢
SON ❤️❤️❤️
please show this againist overrated oil shite :) thx
one who wants to wear the crown, bear the crown👑🔥
this is why son scored a hattrick https://youtu.be/Ed8hioNWMM4
Yo editor, you cut off the comentary way too early on this one boy. i know you wanna farm views, but ayo sort it out boy
Now new era just starting

Sonny is Back with his Magic Goals🐐 Glory Glory Spurs my Lovely Team🤍👊
he is back!
to all haters, ask yourself whether you love yourself or not. if you dont you are just hater to everyone.
Son absolute class…love that man
Son is Back
this is Sonny last year Golden shoes
Son is back~~👍👍👍😍😍😍
Some talking points. Kulusevski, arguably our best attacker right now. Perisic from the right and Sessegnon from the left might be a better option going forward. I have always said 3-5-2 can be a better option at times, and it showed in the last 20 min. Our mid was so stable and allowed Son and Kane to just focus on going up the field. Honestly Son needs to be played as a second striker not a wide winger. Thats why 3-5-2 works for him better.  3-4-3 for possesion but 3-5-2 for counter attack. I kinda wanna see a 4-2-3-1 with Kulusevski in that 10 role. He did mention he perfers to be a 10. All in all, good game and hopefully we keep this momentum. Son- Form is temporary, Class is permanent. WORLD CLASS!!
And they’re benching this guy? What the agrisé fick is conté doing. Fucking clown.
손흥민 선수의 화려한 부활을 보게되서 기쁩니다😭
tielemans overrated as f
우리 흥민이 해트트랙 멋지다!
nobody doubted that son isn't worldclass but i think appropriate amount of criticism made this hat trick
Right foot left foot it dont matter. SONNY!!!!!!
Good striker in English premier league. What a long- range ⚽💯
손을 의심하지마라
How many times must this man prove himself before he gets the respect he deserves? Never in doubt.
손뽕 돌아왔다~~~
I don't get that why we should concern haters' dumb ass. Let them go. No time to watch the play of one of the best players. Sonny.
Sonny is back!
why would you starts this pleb richarlison instead heung min son?thats a joke!
United fan but son is the greatest Asian player to play the game
Never doubted, just waited. I believed. He answered.  Well done Sonny! 👏
I'm glad Son has scored. The pressure was mounting for him to continue where he left off.
Sonny is back 🙌🏻
I'm sick of it. I want Sonny to leave spurs. I don't like Dan Kilpatrick and some local fans.
Pemain badminton hatrick, pelatih putsal diem
I’m an Arsenal fan but I love son so much!! Top player
He's back
conte. your tactic is wrong. if you’re going to use Son like that, transfer him to another team. you are throwing Son as a bait for attacks by Spurs fans and British media.
13min , 3goals, Super Son
No doubt! Sonny did Sonny as usual.
장하다 손흥민 역시 넌 해낼줄 알았어 항상 응원하니 못된 영국놈들 씨부리는건 무시해버렷!!
He is back.    World-class sonny. Fantastic.
I just cried with Son’s goals!
He just thought he was playing against city! It’s his time to wake up every season
Spurs deserved to win that about 18-0. Leicester and their puppet the referee need to try a lot harder next time.
Never doubt  Sonny again
352나 442가 답이다.
the accuracy of Son's shoots was insane
2 goals out of the box, 1 on th left &  1 on th right... That's pure magic performed by Mr Son 💥💥💥💥
Son, You are too precious to be on this team.  Let's leave quickly.  The fans of this club have no respect for you.  The only fans who ignore the top scorer.
Tottenham didn't play that well but still won by a big margin. COYS
What a player son is prime Ronaldo he is and can we talk about how good dier is that shows that why England need him
The King is back!!!!!!!!
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
➤ Minute 59. Heung-Min Son entered.  ➤ Minute 73. Great goal by Heung-Min Son.  ➤ Minute 84. Great goal by Heung-Min Son.  ➤ Minute 86. Goal by Heung-Min Son.   Hadn't he scored in the whole campaign?   Well, today a HAT-TRICK was sent in a period of 13 MINUTES AND 21 SECONDS!!   SOUND.
Hotspur is back with a spear
We have lift off, sonny is back and with a bang and with October being a tricky month it's just in time

If the soccer rule gives extra points for long range shot goals like basketball, Sonny owns golden boots every year.
🙋‍♂️💕👍 son~~~
The killer is back.  his name is Son wick
진정한 챔피언
Today September 18th is my birth day and this match was the best preset I have got from my favorite team and from favorite player Son. I am also Korean so it is so meaningful to me. Thank you Son for making my Birth Day EXTRA special!
Never in doubt  🤫
What a HIS class is~!
콘테 감독은 이번 경기로 손흥민을 어떻게 써야하는지 깨달았으면 좋겠다..손흥민은 페리시치랑 함께 뛸수가 없어 전술도 안맞고 스타일도 달라..
Wow... Son, we love you! One of the best players in the history of PL right there. Amazing! He's one of us!
352 it is.
SON🔥
Son is back
Conte should respect Son's attitude and passion
What’s happening to my favourite team? Come on Brendan, remember Leicester were EPL champions before. We can do it again!
토트넘 팬들이 잊고있는게 있다 해리케인이 이적설로 시끌시끌하게 할때에도 전년 시즌 맨시티전 골 넣고 하드캐리하면서 끌고 간게 쏘니였다. 팀이 힘들때마다 이끌어줬던 선수고 토트넘에 있기 아까운 실력의 월드클래스 선수이다.있을때 잘해라 coys 챔피언스 리그 보내준게 쏘니라는 걸 잊지마라.
토트넘의 수비수 골키퍼 당신들은 진심으로 토트넘의 기생충입니다 그리고 제발 주제 파악을 하세요 또 누구를 가르치려는 행동은 하지 마세요 세상에서 제일 추한 인간은 주제 파악을 못하는 사람입니다
No reason to stay, Sonny. Leave Totspur, Sonny.
Sonny, give a peace of mind to the fans of Tottenham. You looked like you lost your smile on the ground. So search for the another team which can have the real confidence in you!
👍👍👍
Tottenham it is your time to win the league this year.
손흥민을 의심해?배은망덕한 새끼들
I'm barça fan and very happy for son And i wanna ask why conte put him on sub bench??
Amazing sonny
That's my son
Waiting for the extended Highlights 🤩
He didn’t sulk by being on the bench a true professional. Shame on those fans who criticised him
Never in doubt, Son shines
They dont pass enough to Son! I have seen it many timea this season else he would have been on 5 goals or 6 by now.
Сон- машина!
Let's leave this team, son.  If you didn't do a hat-trick today, the blame gets worse  Look at the attitude of spurs fans, son. Look at spurs fans changing their stance, son.  it's so disgusting.
HE IS BACK
레전드 손  안녕😊
너희들 벌써 잊은거야? 그는 저번시즌 득점왕이라구~
wow
How many times am I watching this video repeatedly.. can not stop it… 😂I need to go to sleep!!!!!!

아 소니 골 볼 때 마다 눈깔에 누수가 생기네 ㅅㅂ 아........
which one ur weak foot?  son - what?
He is back!!!
손의 부할이다
Just what Sonny needed. A little bench time showed him he needed to step up. Fantastic managing by Conte!
손흥민이 돌아왔구나!
I would love Son at United
Son is just incredible. But admin, why is it that sky sports highlights are better than our own teams youtube 😂🤦‍♂️
He's back !!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Son😍
Don't be suspicious !!!  son!!!
Son is back
NEVER IN DOUBT SONNY!!
Great! Son!
NEVER DOUBTED YOUUU
That’s one of the most beautiful hat tricks I’ve seen and I’m not even a Spurs fan, happy that it’s Son that gets to do it as well.
Sonny is back, Smile is back, Scoring race is back
Conte Your tactic is wrong.  If you're going to use Son like that, transfer him to another team.  If it is not used like today's Leicester match, Son is too precious to be on this team.  You are throwing Son as a bait for attacks by Spurs fans and British media.
Eventually son is back😎😎🔥🔥🔥
It's just the beginning, Sonny. Show us your wonderful future.
페리시치와의 궁합이 좋지 않을 뿐... 페리시치는 소니의 영역까지 올라오기때문에 종종 손은 페리시치보다 뒤에 위치하게되고 그런 상태에서 공을 받아봤자  페리시치를 견제하기 위한 수비들이 앞을 막고 있으므로 폭발적인 스피드를 활용한 장점을 전혀 발휘 할 수 없다...
HMS. What a player. Coming from a United fan
Cmon. show SON's first goal celebration. just stood silently . it really meant something. SONs comin for you Haaland
Son 😮
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Sonny's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
눈물나네  첫골이 드디어
The King is back... 👑👑👑
3골 넣었어. 내가. 됐지?
Last year Son was able to become the top scorer because he had to take charge of the team's scoring due to Kane's late return. This year, Kane recovered his original form from the begining, and Son had competitors. Last year's glory weighed on Sonny, and Conte's tactics changed. If Sonny is given space to drive the ball and an accurate pass, we will experience another game like today. He is world class in counterattacks.
소니~ 토트넘에서 우승 컵 들고 빅클럽으로 가자~

Props to Conte. He benched sonny and awakened the goal machine.
Tottenham Hotspur king is back Sonny🇰🇷!!😂😁
I am happy Son put on a show. I glad he go for his shooting boots from South Korea for this game#COYS
The king is back.
Don't forget Son saved this team for 6 years

으앙 ㅜㅜ 흥민아!!!!!!!!!!
Haters, racists jump into the river. Sonny, you must move your team next year.

Sonaldo 🇰🇷
Benching Sonny is starting to produce some results......Let the players fight for their positions, that will produce massive results
sonny. now ask to transfer. this club’s fans doubted you so badly. they don’t deserve to have you. let’s go to other club now
bruv 💀
Son7⚽️⚽️⚽️🔥
A real throwback to Leicester 6-1 away in 2017.   Son back just in time for Arsenal.
Hat-trick : Right , left, counter attack Legend never die. Never doubt him again 😢 The KING is back 👑
흥민이가 홀란드에게 어드벤티지를 준건가??  "자 이제부터 시작이야..기다려 홀란드~!!"
Why was the penalty retaken?😕
Bruh, that goals are too underrated. All 3 goals are toooo good. If some other player had scored those three, people would go crazy. Even if Messi or Ronaldo did that.  I guess Son is too good people are used to screamers.
Never in doubt. 3-5-2
Do not mention Son's confidence. Before 8 games's problem was Conte's tatic not a Son's confidence. That opinion is disgusting.
king is back!
Heung-Min my Son
I think we played fantastic, this result shows that we have excellent forwards, excellent midfielders (maybe a CAM would help when we need to score against deep blocks like Maddison) but we need better defenders, or to improve our already present excellent defenders, Sanchez is excellent btw, 1 mistake doesn't make you bad lol
That leceister keeper is extremely sus based on the games i've seen him play...their missing schmeichel.
NEVER DOUBT HIM.... and also plz usr 352 plzzzzz
What a way to silence the critics...
From the bench 25yards with the left 25yards with the right Then finish it with a classic What a player🔥🔥🔥
352 352
덕분에 영국에도 기레기가 많다는 걸 알았습니다 🤡🤫
Finally from 343 to 352.. 352 more work out to son.. juve and inter become a winner because 352.. When conte at the chelsea 343 because his got hazard and willian to support diego costa
Sonny 👍👍👍
3 goals in 13 minutes 😱😱😱 Hat-trick ⚽️⚽️⚽️ It's Sonny's day!✌✌✌ Congrats Sonny!👏👏👏
When we asked for a player like KDB we got it it's perisic
흥민이 믿고있었다구😂
He knows he got to catch up. This man has been better every season after season. We just need a quality CB and should drop Sessegnon and Emerson. Play Lucas as RWB instead. He is good in the air.
흥민이 친구 잘했어
Dier what a brick wall
SSSOOOOOONNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!
ㅜㅜ..손흥민 선수..축하해요
As a Liverpool fan, I come to this channel only for Son.
So happy to Sonny's finally back👍 and also big win result's too. Keep focus the top of the league! COYS🔵⚪
big problem was Perisic with 343... 352 is the best for Son
My word...best Asian footballer ever? Certainly on his way there
If Leicester city continue playing rubbish football like this I'm afraid they might be relegated. 😭
Shoutout to R. Bentancur for his goal and his grit
3-5-2  Plz give freeroll to son-kane
never doubt him Tottenham is Son
Son is back did u see that? stupid Anti fans

Conte now should notice Perisić and Sonny doesn't work well along together unless moving Perisić to right back and discard Royal. Let's go back to  3-5-2 formation use Sonny
Tottenham ganó
Richarlison is definitely a good player but he's not yet fully immersed in team’s tactics. Rather, it has been proven today that Kane, Son and Klusevsky's combination in forward like last year is more effective. Richarlison needs more time for sure.
every fucking game he has to spend so much energy playing fucking defense i want to see him thrive on what he does best
Welcome back Sonny!
3-5-2 is the answer.  Do not let Son do defence.
Son always the best in EPL Do not put him as a serve.
No doubt son plz
son proved his value by himself !!
Brilliant game today by the team. Spurs scoring a few from corners, great goal by Bentancur, Lloris on point once again and just fantastic team football in general.Welcome back Sonny with a brilliant substitute performance. Time to have this time firing on all cylinders and the best is yet to come. COYS!!!
Sonny is back to reclaim his golden boot 🇰🇷❤️
손흥민선수 완전 파이팅입니다 항상 힘내시고 항상 응원합니다 ♡ 오늘 3골이 그동안의 모든걸 다 날려버린것 같습니다 ^^
바로 부활 할수 있다고 믿었음
There is no reason to doubt it
항상 믿고 있었다고!!! 첫골에 울었다ㅠ.ㅠ 흥민아 가즈아~!!!!
손흥민 화이팅!! 너무 수고했습니다
Son's finishing is over 9000
Uff!! Sonnyyy🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🫶🫶🫶🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Son Heungmin is the best~
Sonny is the King in spurs. Plz don't ever doubt him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
손흥민 첫골 후 세레모니  기뻐하지 않네. 맘고생 심한듯
Conte you would have seen Perry switch seats in the first half today Perry, the wingback, eats the wing position and is not connected and the speed dies! That Clue and Richardson couldn't do anything! Perry's cross is fantastic, but there's not much chance of scoring! Conte, you have to think carefully If the ferry comes out, the build-up is too slow and there is no counterattack The most important thing is that the wings overlap and the spaces are ruining! Like the build-up in the second half, Heung-min flew around in the 352 system and made a hat trick Perry at 343 is the worst. Remember, you shouldn't start at 343!
Haters' gonna hate Doubters' gonna doubt  Son's gonna score 🐐❤️
I'm sorry guys but I've to say this Perisic needs to take our corners from on, so happy for Son to be back in form, let's take this energy to the North London Derby, I'm expecting nothing but a win there
손! 인생 참 힘들게 산다 팀을 옮겼으면 편하게 대접을 받으면서 월클로 고속도로 타는데 왜 인생을 그렇게 살지? 그곳은 철저하게 이기적으로 살아야 하는 곳 아님? 축구는 잘하는데 다른 머리는 참 참 참 돌대가리는 돌대가리다 오늘 손이 마음에 드는 건 바보처럼 히죽거리지 않은 것
he is back
Spurs ♡♡♡♡♡
Sonny is back by more stronger
BBC : Never in doubt
손흥민 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Son is different man😭 My guy silenced the haters,Critics In just 13 minutes 😵
This is exactly what our enemies fear Son would do, and deep down they are always worrying about him. Stop saying he contributes nothing when he doesn’t score.
I really hate Koreans. I hate it. It's probably because of the Japanese that Sony scored.🇯🇵
7경기만의 첫골 그리고 헤트트릭... 웅장하다. 다시가즈아~
Never thot it wud be possible to show 8 goals in 2 min
The legend, hero, pride & treasure of South Korea 🇰🇷 The man is a beast 🔥
Well Done Sonny~ You are the BEST. Now zip up to all the big mouths!!!
Let's take a moment to appreciate Hugo Lloris. The way he played today.. for me he still has 5+ years in him
No matter how good his son is, the team and fans continue to doubt him. And test it. Because he is Asian. For him, he wants to leave the team and go to another team.
Son amazing 👏
Sonny finally switched on!! He will be on fire from now on🔥🔥🔥
Those right left foot are equally strong!
Was about DAMN TIME!
Sonny ❤️❤️
6 games 0 goals --> 7 games 3 goals  Hattrick in 13 minutes off the bench Such a beast Son is 🐐🔥
I'M NEVER TIRED OF WATCHING SONNY'S GOAL.

Conte changed tactic 532 it will work for him and also we can see Kane and Son combination. That is we want to see!!! Sonny congratulations for 13min for hat trick and your goals are high quality too. Class is forever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤We love you very much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Some people doing, they need to see too believe.  Well now you know what the rest of us already knew.  Sonny is a LEGEND.  End.  Of.  WHOOOOOOOO
When so many of Tottenham's goals are headers, Son's mid-range shots are like deep three-pointers in basketball. So refreshing
🥰😍😇😊😚😘 : 2
imagine the bar being so high for sonny that the only way to save his spot was to score a hatrick. what a king!
Damn, I am speechless. However, we got to work on our level of conceding goals, that's got to stop. Coys

Excellent work on the comeback victory! Son's performance was perfection ✨
Perisic was so happy for Sonny, he didn't even care about a yellow card
